The game that changed women’s sports 😂😂
Angel Reese masterclass.
GREAT,TO GREATNESS. 🔥🏀🔥🏆.   🏀LSU🏀
Chen mechan😊
This Game is so Satisfying ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Now I see why they are so pissed off Caitlinis getting all the accolades in the WNBA. But, she deserves them. She’s simply playing better than the others. Good teammates help. I mean, Reese doesn’t look bad here, but fell apart after entering the WNBA. Go figure! She’ld make a good model thou!
Nothing but a 3pt shootout!!!!
I really think the spirit of K BRYANT was with LSU
Jasmine Carson! That was a shooting game for the bars!
how is Carson not in the WNBA right now???
put some respect on Alexis Morris!
Im here after the 2025 WNBA all star game.. Angel is the best of all time 👑 Skytown baby yeaaaa
Morris took us home in the 2nd half
CC is being CC, but Reese is playing an amazing game here...she totally choked in the WNBA ....what went wrong? Playimg for the Sky, she acts like she can't hook things up.
They definitely not like us….LSU💜💛🖤
I'm happy to see Angel's game.
Here 2 years later
This shows that team Work makes the dream work. There was no way they would’ve won against clarck if they didn’t all scored points .
It’s so funny because Iowa was so cocky just knowing they would win, this will feel my soul for the rest of my life. LSU was HUNGRY
I watched this whole thing to see what the hubbub was with Angel Reese taunting Clark and nothing.
This video give me chills till this day! What a game
3:54 🎒 🛍 ✈️
Angel the goat
LSU Is Back in 2025 ,IOWA Is Just A Memory
That was a crazy game
Wow historic moment for women’s basketball that yeat
🔥🔥
This team was onw for the books @LSU
lsu had like what 19 travels uncalled
LSU was shooting the lights out 🏀🏀

I can't stop watching 😊

Are they cheating on that scoreboard, IOWA had 36, got a layup and then got 39 - huh? Or is this because of a free throw that they didn't show??
have any of the wnba games had a team score 90-100 points consistently?

5:37 such a legendary moment 🔥and game from Jasmine Carson hope she signs to a WNBA team next year!
God’s people won
LSU can play some ball. Hard to believe they were only seeded 3.
Best girls lsu team of all time who was better you tell me
The lesbian Apes vs cute sic women
J. Carson killed them in the first half
💛💛💛💛 💜💜💜💜
Lsu played as a team❤❤
I can't stop watching 😂😂😂Lsu balled  out
White people just have really good aim...
Say what you want , Clarke was not better than Carson,  she literally could not guard Carson! She is not the best player , everyone on the lsu starting 5 is better than clarke
I don't see how this was such a "good" game. There were no lead changed, and LSU was in the lead and in control for the entire game.
So this is the one that started it all, this newfound interest in women’s basketball, lol?
Why all these great players at LSU were not drafted and get no attention in the media?
Why Jasmine Carson was not drafted to WNBA? For me she was the best player in.this game
Brash and flashy city vs. corn-fed wholesome country. Good times. Well played.
This girl is on  🔥 🔥 📛
Abgel Rees in the paint ...
Congratulations & Bravo🎉LSU Lady Tigers Against Iowa State
This was amazing!!! What a thrilling match!
I just realized all Iowa had was the three
If anyone comes back to this I’m curious was there more lsu fans or Iowa fans at this game
Carson was on fire 🔥🔥🔥
Caitlin Clark = 0 NCAA Titles
Carson was the best player on the floor today.
umm question how is a team with 2 loses a  "3" and a Team with 6 loses is a "2"
these girls put womens basketball on the maps. Rivalries, skills and showmanship on display.. WNBA should take note on what they doing..
I mean, you didn’t do any research. Forgot to mention, once they won, the White House invited both teams(when has that ever happened). How are they supposed to support a country that truly doesn’t support them!!!
Iowa falls short Back2Back years!
The day Black folks won. 👆🏿
We did it first
Carson is money in the bank, federally insured. ❤ Johnson had to, Euro-step on em'...she had to.❤...that was pretty.
Chills is an understatement such an amazing game!!
Worst officiated game in NCAA tourney history? They gave this away to LSU.
Angel reese
Then Hailey came & ruined us . I swear she a double agent
Needed jasmine carson! HVL sold bad!!....where was jasmine this season?
World is glad Iowa WON
The blk folks are trying to start a race war over women’s basketball
WHAT HAPPENED
Where is this game played?
This what them crxkas still salty about😂😂😂
I thought the game was over on that bank shot to end the "2nd" didn't know they went by quarters. I was like thats kinda wierd to be running plays when up by 14 and 5 seconds to play.
LSU got more than 100
LSU!!!!!!!
Who’s here just to feel more confident about their bets this year 🤣
Who else came here to scout for tonight’s game   Man Carson and Williams was clutch 😱
Carson was killing it !
Clark did everything she could but when every shot drops for the other team you can’t beat that
Anyone here now that they’re going to have a rematch in the elite 8?
Iowa got Blew Out how was it a great game????
When you got a woman's team where all the women are built and look like men, what do you expect?
Like... WOW! What amazing gameplay! I'm not the most savvy but am I wrong in stating the gameplay was above par in comparison to WNBA? If this is the new generation heading to the league I'm investing in  wnba season tickets. Just awesome basketball.
Reese is pretty much classless. Gonna be fun to watch her go by the wayside this tournament. 😄
Heck yeah LSU hopefully the clark girl learned some humility
Lsu not that deep this year
LSU was amazing. great basketball fundamentals. beautiful and did not look back and took it.
Iowa set so many moving screens that didn’t get called
Bro why was reese all over the news after this win. I heard her name like twice thru this whole video
Ok this my first time watching this but the big name was Reese, I seen Carson go off…. Hmm
Clark reggie Miller lol
“Dashing🗣️, dishing🗣️, Williams finishing🗣️📣” 10:23😂
The game that ignited women's basketball great game
LSU sucks
Carlson was on demon time! A whole bucket 😈
Jasmin drinked MJ juice before this game 😂 she was on one. Definitely shut the critics up during this game.
I felt this ❤❤❤❤ not bad 4 sum nappy headed holes huh ? 😂😂😂😂 I bet they thought Becky was gon win it all ! Nah we own basketball 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Every time I watch this I get goosebumps.
Carson was hitting that b
Mf play like a stretch big Shooter😭
Clark is pressure off the perimeter....and i love lsu reselliance to push threw
Almost that time again.  Let's get #2 LSU #GEAUXTIGERS
JESUS loves you and died for your sin and on the third he rose again repent and trust in him
How was LSU a 3 seed
If you have a player thsts hot, give it to her.
This was personal ❤
this is such a great highlight video!  this is incredible basketball🎉❤
2024 I will always come back to this game it put women's college basketball on the map for alot of new viewers LSU played elite basketball at the perfect time
why wasn't Jasmine Carson drafted?
Go LSU....!!!
Why can't the WNBA be this good?
Black women vs white women, basically 🤷🏾‍♂️
Clark is definitely the Stephen curry of woman’s basketball!
Easy work Lsu,💯💯
One person can't beat no team 🤣🤣
Kim gets her "1 shining meauxment".
This game was more entertaining then the man’s 2023 nba  finals
I come back and watch this game often we really witnessed the best NCAAW basketball game ever 💯🔥
LSU dominated the entire game
This game exposed Lobo as a game analyst she let it out witch way she wanted the game to go
Clark the best
Like the men's 2019 football team, this was a team of destiny.
Alexis Morris and Jasmin Carson carried
Someday I hope there can be full games…. Someday…..
Bon Dia Chicas
Lets go tigers
I still get chills every time I watch Jasmine Carson in this game.
Caitlin team suck they keep giving the ball to her rather than shooting it themselves
Can’t wait
This is so much better than the WNBA. How is it ?
I can watch this and rub my feet!! Iowa came back in the second half playing dirty 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that $h!t don't get you no where loll
Clark gonna torch that racist in rematch. The whole crowd gonna be mocking Reese with the hand gestures& security will intervene to save “I play for people that look like me”.
❤❤❤
That game inspired me so much to watch woman’s basketball I’m gonna watch this years season of the WNBA.  When does it start?
IOWA coach is having a break down when LSU do their spin move😂
The black girls look like strippers
Women basketball getting better
Fun to watch Iowa beat up on South Carolina.
Say that was a run for the ages
She Curry the steph 3s 😮
Great game of basketball
We gone ignore the fact Angel Reese played horrible?
1 question for everyone on here, which player's game best translates into the WNBA ?
👑💍🏆LSU
LSU vs Caitlin Clark
This was the most incredible display of womens basketball EVER!
I was ecstatic to see this game be so entertaining looking forward to 2023-2024. Please tell me clark back and got help. If flajaunae got better it will be a massacre i need the competition and so do they. If i was these schools i would purposely try to create some balance dont kd golden state it either team or either both teams do it.
The best women college basketball ball game ticket i ever bought ...i had iowa fans wanting to kill me ...😂💜💛💜💛
How is called WOMEN basketball. Isn’t that homophobic?
Love to see black excellence beat the others but aye what’s her name Clark she definitely going to the WNBA
I went to the future an saw this same game with a lot of missed calls an really really bad calls against LSU vs the same team but LSU pulled it off an they was undefeated
That's what the boondocks predicted what happened😅😅😅😅
like love music wnba
Wow
Finally women that can play basketball, lsu couldn't stop Caitlyn Clark  and the only way to win was shutting the door on the rest of the Iowa and then the nerve to dis the best player in the league,  classless act
It’s wild that people pretend this was a good game
Tbh this was LSU vs Caitlin Clark
LSU's bench and supporting cast is too deep for IOWA... Too many shooters ...
That was a good championship remember that
What the heck did I just watch? That was so action packed my god I wish I was in those stands
Lol this was  basicslly Black girls vs white girls
That was an amazing game go LSU❤❤❤
This game more popular than Wnba.😂
W game 🔥
Nice to see how all the Midwest  people were crushed by a far superior team.
Fire Game ! i Just started watching womens basketball Hard and i have been ballin all my life !
I would love to see this epic game part of an inspirational movie someday
1:40 shouldn’t have been a foul 😢 Clark didn’t do anything!!
That was electrifying
Lsu i cry im so proud of yall🎉
Funk Iowa
Against a female bro? Highly questioning your energy bro  and I doubt the results of that was Angel Reese or a WNBA star
All 600 fans
Angel talking trash is pathetic, especially when her teamed carried her and Clark doubled her points, why she flaunting for?
You can tell that the female commentator is upset that Iowa lost…lol
White girls can ball! 🎉
Angel really dominated
As a lsu fan I’m not going to lie Catlin clarke shot is so good
Caitlin needed to involve her team mates more like LSU did.  You cant just jack up a bunch of 3s and expect to beat a good team.  Defense wins championships not shooting long 3s.  She is talented but its just bad basketball.
Iowa only cenado and Clark vs LSU super star
white vs black
My grandson from Baton Rouge he so happy
Let’s be honest this was a "us" against "them" game
The difference, LSU team against Caitlin Clark.  That woman can play some ball, but she couldn't beat the LSU team.
Goo power ⛮
Iowa Smoked by a full LSU team effort!
Lebron would dominate the women's league hands down. It wouldn't even be a contest
LSU is gonna win back to back
Iowa same game plan to beat south Carolina got them beat against LSU thinking sec teams couldn't shoot but good game
Flau'jae , angel Reese ❤❤❤
Clark is a BUCKET ❗️❗️
I did not hear nothing about no Carson. Only angel, and flaue or whatever that girl with the blonde fro was a G and should have been talked about a little bit atleast
They wanted to play 3 point ball and LSU smoked them.
LSU's Coaching hiring the last couple years ihas been The Best in College. 🏈 Women's 🏀, They're puttin' in that work.
Reese and Clark is women’s basketball upcoming
Summitt, Geno, Kim 🐐🐐🐐
This was like one of the only entertaining womens basketball game I’ve seen😂
This was an amazing game 👏 👏 👏  to both teams. They both played hard. Carson and Clarke were my favorites in this game, they're were on fire the entire game. Both teams must have outstanding coaches as well. Congrats to LSU.
You know that was a race game...
If Caitlin Clark didn't play in that game...LSU would have probably won 130- 65. Sometimes the best loses. That's all a part of sports.
Lol…good luck filling them seats!
Are college players better than WNBA players or am i imagining things
Oh yeah flaujaee did that to even up the score sis fell and everything but my baby still made that bucket
This was so nice and inspiring to watch. When I get depressed I come here now it gives me hope.
People hype caitlyn Clark up like the the next Kobe,Mj, Lebron etc, for the women’s league but her basketball skills are about JJ Reddick level.
100 times better than present WNBA Games 🔥👌 Hopes for future.
Women’s basketball
Very classless team
That was amazing baseball all the way around.   So much talent.  The amount of three pointers was insane.
💜🧡💜💛💜💛
Is this white vs black fight
unfortunately this game was about race , but this was the most exciting sporting event i’ve ever seen . period . no qualifiers .
I wanna watch Iowa's whole 5 players Introduction not just gabi marshal
I am a “Die Hard “ LSU fan but I never watched women’s basketball.  It was mostly football and baseball.  This was one of the most amazing games I have ever watched. LSU ladies came out to play and get that ring Looking forward to next season.  Kim Mulkey has built a dynasty.
Carson and Morris need more shine. Carson was on fire this game and Morris guarded Clark nearly the whole game!
Clark from the logo was disgusting
The last time I cheered this hard during a women’s basketball game was back in 2004 when I was a senior and my High School’s ladies basketball team was in the playoffs…yeah, it’s been a minute.
First time I am seeing women's game great,  produce good game like this , stop focusing on competing with Men for the same pay, Men generating more revenue they will paid more
Is this white girls vs Black girls tournament
Lol i absolutely love Emily ward. She was cheering from the bench the entire time. Im glad she finished her senior year off this way...
I can’t wait to see Reese vs clarke in the WNBA. Ide watch that.
Waouh ! Ces filles sont juste incroyable !!!!😮😮😮
I ain’t gon lie Clark is TOUGH!
These ladies put on a show!
Truly I do not know about you. But it feels so good to me when the underdog can win. Yes the one that you actually count out great job lady tigers absolutely great job ❤️💎💎🌹⭐💯
LSU be slaying
🎉that was a great game🖤‼️
i just watched game lol but why everybody was talking like it a close game?? 17 points bruh
I dont watch women basketball.... But this game here i wish every game was like this!  Amazing game Lsu and Iowa !
Jasmine Carson needs more recognition she a bucket
LSU traveling like a mf 😂😂😂
Blew out Iowa!
Look at the records.. LSU was the superior team
all smile watching this game, i never knew womens game could be this competitive. Clerk is good 3pointer but Reese and the blonde girl are untouchable🙂Wow
LSU is just insane team ❤❤❤.
What a hella sweet game 💥💥💥💥💥.
Way more exicting any wnbgay game I've seen
Dope Game. Clark can't is definitely a shooter.... 100%, but the better team won.
Carson channeling her inner Curry.
Someone explain why its literally black gals Vs white gals..is it coz of the colleges they go to! How does team selection be like that??
Basically Iowa was there to secure Clark a spot in the drafts
Like babies against young women.
I love women basketball, these women ain't no joke.
LSU were definately the better team !!!
Ouuu LSU just ate them up 🤣
Those women play great 👍👍
My uninformed takeaway was that Clark was by far the best player on the court but LSU had so much better depth that it didn't matter. It's a team sport and this is the proof.
They are amazing but god they have no balance
White people suck at sports. 1 good white girl out of all colleges.
Woe black vs white
this was amazing
Reese get out of the double line😅😂❤🎉
Angel rule one love the butter squad Nuts😂❤🎉🎉
Aye that clark is tuuuuff
J. Carson torch Caitlin Clark.
Jasmine Carson 😂😂🖤🖤
Im a fan! I'll be watching from now on , these girls are all amazing players .
LSU dropping Buckets from all corners. IWOA=Clark
Angel Reese so mf fine
Never watch women basketball before but this one was interesting and entertaining
jasmine carson was the key to lsu success
This lsu team just pulled away....
WNBA need to start dishing out million dollar contracts
Women’s basketball is almost watchable these days.
❤again
Just heard everybody will be drafted
The late rapper camouflage’s daughter plays for LSU. She’s number 4, Flauge Johnson. I know her dad has to be proud.   C-port!!!!!
This was a beautiful and entertaining final. Well played ladies.  👏👌👍🙌. Congratulations LSU. Well deserved, the drive and tenacity was unmatched!
Reese is nice but, jasmine Carson is on another level
Williams with the Euro Step....so sweet
The scoring on that game was better than almost every WNBA game ever and  was like an NBA box score.
1st time watching a women's basketball game. Amazing. I never knew they could actually play
Gotdam these ladies were on fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 🔥  Let’s not forget about both them coaches too. 😮 Hats off
This will be female marketable version 2023 of Larry bird and magic Johnson If wba start making the Narrative z the league be a lott more bigger
Protect them ladies at all times..  That was bigger than what you see... I know the energy was amazing ✨️
Clark vision is amazing. Every pg should have vision but hers shined the most despite losing.
LSU have some shooters and Clark on IOWA can SHOOT 🔥🔥
Wow
All 12 minutes highlights, I didn't catch a single LSU players name, I can name 4 Iowa names. Bias media 😢
LSU #2 was all Steph curry on the court
Clark #22 went straight Kobe on the court
Bruh LSU Clapped IOWA lmaoooo
The fact that ESPN has over 1 million views on this video after only 1 week shows how much interest and excitement there was in Women's Basketball this year
I watched this condensed part of the game more ten times. Thanks to Iowa and LSU players for this exhilarating game.
This is the first time I’ve ever watched women’s basketball. Great game.
The both played extremely well - that’s why Mrs Biden wanted both to show up at the House.
LSU lady Tigers were dropping threes like nobody’s business!!! But to me Angel Reese was the difference down low. Iowa could not box her out. She muscled everyone around as she rebounded and scored in the paint.
Try to be????
These women can shoot!
Traaaaaaash
How come iowa has almost only white players and why Clark doesn't have booòbs?😮
Listening to the pregame music lsu destroy iowa in pregame
Listening. To  these. People. In. The. Comment. Section. They. Are. Jealous. And. Envy. Because. The. Want. The. White. Girl win. But. Not. Tonight. All. Three. Of. These lady. Are. Milionare. Not. After  that. Big. Game. They. Are. Better. Off. That. Most. Of us. In. This. Comment. Section. No. Cap. Or. Lie.  All. The. Endorsement. From  their tube on channel. Shoe. Deal. And tic. Tac. They. Come. Up only. Person. I. Wish. Could. Get. A. Better. Deal. To. Make. Money is. Jasmine. Carson. Because. She. Play. Like. The. Real. Superstar. That. Night. Super impressive. She is. The. Real MVP. Of. That. Championship. Game.
Catlin is not the only one that can shoot ,right Jasmine.
Those commentators you can tell who they're going for by their enthusiasm,  or lack there of....so glad LSU disappointed them!!!🤣 Congratulations to my Purple Passion LSU Lady Tigers!!🙏🙌💜🎊🎉
It’s a magnet in that hoop
shooting for the win
They want 50 million dollar contracts? 🤣🤣 Don’t get it twisted; they are pretty good 🔥
Congrats LSU but that Clark girl finna be a force in the WNBA.
6:47 listen to the pink devil refer to her as a man. My daughter also has natural 4C hair that's not straighten down to her back and some devil men thought she was a boy.
It's because one and out and they compete everynight....❤
College basketball is better than the pros .❤
Clark is a straight baller
lol its funny that for over a decade , online comments have been filled with negative comments towards womens basketball always saying that nobody watches.. And now all of a sudden everyone is an expert on both teams . hilarious
Carson MVP easy
This is one of the best ncaa woman’s chip game  of all time
Clark hard tho
White Team (Iowa) vs Black Team (LSU)...you already know who was going to win. Caucasian women playing basketball cannot be compared to the amazing beautiful black women.
This was such a great game! Both teams are obviously talented, but LSU was just seamless. They moved as one unit, one team. They were incredible!
I can’t believe Iam watching this for the 5th time.
The most amount of women’s basketball I have watched in my entire and it was actually enjoyable.
Officially a fan of woman’s basketball
Women’s college basketball is like watching teams filled with Stephen curry’s 😩😩
holl'up holl'up..aint no black player in iowa hawkeyes
If the commentator says “ Meet the moment “ one more time!
Man these women on both teams was lightning it up out there
Beast of a contest! The effect of Curry is palpable. Caitlin Clark is SHARP!
Clark was by far the best player. Why is Reese getting so much recognition?
They showed so many highlights from the white team you would’ve thought they won.
First. Coach Mulkey a beast when it comes to coaching. Check out her record 😏. Nxt your whole bench should be ready regardless whether they’re your starting 5 or not everyone on LSU team was shooting at 100% as opposed to Iowa. They only had Clark on the boards she couldn’t do it by herself. End of story.
This game was low key entertaining😂
No matter the sport, LSU always seems to have stars on their rosters (or soon to be stars).  That LSU effect is real.
These ladies are ALL VERY GOOD PLAYERS. Both teams
Shoot, they more entertaining than men college basketball. They hit more shots! 😮
Congratulations to LSU women's basketball team , great game, Iowa better luck next time
I was liking carson but #22 on iowa is the female steph my gawd
Well don lsu but Clark is very good
This was white vs black on the court
Nacional Champion WNBA/NBA
Is there anybody from Louisiana on that team? All paid transfers except maybe a few freshmen. Nice. Why not just call it a paid professional league?
That girl Clark she is 🔥 🔥 🔥
NBA' women basketball 🏀 has improved 👏🏿
Why am i sitting here watching this again , crying , a week later  🤦🏽‍♀️
LSU coach couldn't even believe it😊
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That game was so lit🔥🔥
Clark...........Curry
I think this might be the game that changes women's Basketball forever. In a good way too
Clark is crazy too wow 😮
Carson tho!!!  jeeeez 😮
Caitlin Clark still the best player of the League , but she will need a twin sister to win against LSU. they have well rounded shooters. Excellent Final. 😁💝❤‍🔥Also the refeering it was terrible. 🥶🥶🥶
When white people do it, it's success. When black people do it, its suspect!
I've come back everyday just to watch Jasmine Carson in the first half
Awesome game I tell ya! Go LSU
GG  CARSON ON FIRE OMFG🔥
Caitlyn Clark the female steph curry
💛💜💍🫶🏽🏆🐅
They were on fire 🔥 😫 😍 😊😊
Great game and props to both teams for giving us an incredibly enjoyable game! Congrats LSU!
LSU just had too many weapons. Iowa only had Clark to score and two others
Best game ever; even better on a full re watch
Proud of flau'jae that girl came along way
I'm impressed at the Ladies of LSU, they did their Thang...
nahh jasmine cookin everybody cookin
Good job LSU!🔥🍾💍
BLACK POWER! 🏆
Clark wasn't being disrespectful with her taunting but Reese got in Clarks face and kept it up...the officiating ruined what could have been a better game and different outcome.. everyone can sugarcoat it but that's just fact
What's up with Iowa's 1960's 7th grade gym clothes?????
This was a good game, but LSU was too much for them, and that girl from Iowa is a female curry gzz she was lightning it up
These ladies performed like pros
Thanks for the comments
Reese gotta show respect to Clark. Clark carry that whole team and Reese didn’t do as much. Clark got my respect!!!Great game to both teams.
That was such a high energy game.
Na, We not gone act like Carson didn’t carry this game🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👀Why is the star in the shape of the Baphomet🤔🤷🏽‍♂️ in the paint and Tv screen👀👀👀👀👀
These mf women was BALLING
See, u draw tickets, u make money. Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark may be actual real money makers for the WNBA for the first time
Good job LSU
They played as a team, didn’t depend on their leading scorer’s. Great game
Amazing game
How do I access the match broadcast live
If  you  are  a  star  player , you  need  to  take  over  the  game  and  put  the  team  on  your  back..MJ  did  it  in  the  90s...Caitlin  Clark  failed  to  do  so. She  should  have  played  more  of  an  inside  game.
I enjoyed watching those black girls slay.
Its like everything moving in slow motion..
Great ball handling and great teamwork! What a game!
Clark is amazing to watch
👀👀👀godam
Them announcers was very happy & excited for Iowa Sheesh but then it Changed LSU went Off & Made them Eat them words 😂😂😂
And to think Iowa got invited to the WH. Get out!
I’m about to start watching women’s basketball. Thanks to Angel Reese
WNBA take notes, people want to be entertained. If you give it, they will come.
Clark > Reese
Sweet game
Lil white girl wuz ballin is all i gotta say! She wuz the truth out there! & im a black dude x pro ball player. Clark wuz drano
the new age civil war 😂 yall seen who won again 🤷🏽‍♂️
Excellent playing by both teamsI dont always agree with the Bidens But Jill was right both need to Go To the whitehouse
This is crazy who is that girl hittin those three’s like Layups. Someone with that kind of confidence could be like Curry
Ladies you were awesome!!!!!!! This is history, I can see a life time movie out of this!
Jasmin Is flame🔥
Caitlin Clark is her
Nah no. 22 kaitlyn klark is a bad mf
LSU handled business and some. Clark goes crazy tho. Great game.
Iowa’s player are fluorescent white, their so white
So they going to act like Carson now raw a$$ that’s a true baller
Read I love you who is my favorite basketball player❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
That girl Clark is going to wnba foreal she needs a good team around her
KIM MULKEY THE GOAT
Carson is the best in heated situations i bet!time ticking bring out the muscle 💪🏾 just when the thought the best. Carson is the secret weapon the 🌎 know that now. They aint gone let nomore players win. This going in the history books📚
She is a great player but Wonder Woman could not beat the LSU team
this is like a female version of a magic and bird rivalry
The black girl on the purple team irritates me
Shout out to Caitlin for not playing the victim. Trash talk is a part of the game. If you give it, you have to take it. She could of easily cried foul, but she took it like a G. It’s sad to see these old men say the despicable things they are saying about a 20 yr old kid just having fun.
Not gonna lie that highlight was better than some NBA ones. I like that NCAA let's the players play. NBA is a little soft. This was a boost for woman's basketball. Can't wait to see the future.
Reese bad bad show them next cobe heard push it girl in you ❤already
This was an amazing game!! Congrats LSU
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Very great game!!! ❤🎉 Everybody was hitting on LSU! Iowa did amazing as well!
These ladies can shoot, goddam they're good
Sometimes I feel like womans play better than mens!  Im just trippin or it's truth???
Black vs. White is too good of a selling point in America
Women's basketball need to be more in the out front these ladies are bad azzzz frfr team LSU United States need to make women basketball more popular here then overseas
LSU: better fundamentals , passing , just all around good basketball Caitlyn a beast but tried to beat the whole team herself
The differential in athleticism between these teams was startling.  Why does any team from the Big Corn Conference even try to take on any of the athletes of the SEC in a natty in any sport anymore?  It’s futile for the plodders.  Did you see how stunned the plodders were at the end of the 1H?  They didn’t know what to do.
I'm not a fan of either team. But regardless this was a terribly officiated game. May be the worst I've ever witnessed, men's or women's.
Loved It . Super Heavy Weight Fight.
The Moves these Young Ladies played was watching some of the best, action skills in such a high quality . ! They played with great skill . Simple if anyone put the moves seen by these women on person. 3 pointers ,bumping,  blocking out, layups .  Over all ,Great competition. Any of those women could be playing on the same team next time. Depending on the others skill to take out their new opponent .! Game on Women Basketball getting fierce .
You've done nothing good in your life...Ever!
Nothing but garbage!
The whole family is garbage. Fact!
She's garbage. Always has been.
Ok let's not trip over lsu win because we know iowa gets an assist because LSU would have definitely lost to South Carolina..
Caitlin way better than those thots
I didn’t see clark get bump when going through the lane 🤔
They wanted Clark to be the answer but it turned out that she was only the question 😄 she is definitely talented but not this time , the commentator said that Clark was almost fictional , that made me laugh 😃💯congratulations LSU , excellent performance ladies , God bless y'all, everyone...
The girl with blonde curly hair was definitely the MVP
Carson was shooting like John wick
Watching the highlights game me chills ❤🤟🏾🫶🏾🔥🥳🎉🎊
💯💯💯
The passing and depth of lsu was just a beautiful thing to see
Carson’s got that steph curry shot!!
Clark vs LSU.. Clark is the best women basketball player I've ever seen..
Lol I bet Clark wasn't waving anyone off and leaving them open to shoot this game 😂
Its weird because that was more entertaining than a WNBA game!!!
Goes to show that you can't depend on one player
You cant deny Caitlin Clark’s shot. That range is Curry goat 😮‍💨
Dam them girls from both teams was playing hard ball
Wow...great game
Glad for women athletes as a whole despite what the media is propagating in this era. This was probably the most watched game and could bring attention to female sports in general. We should look at this in a broader context…equality means less power for some and continuous control. Everyone should think about this
Lsu Was Just Better !! Bottom Line.  Lsu Had four Players That Could Shoot just as good as Clark can.
I came for angel
Them LSU guhs was HOOPIN!!!! 🤩
Sad that so many want to bring up anything racist about this game show love people just shows how screwed up some people's heads are.   The better team won that's it had nothing to do with the refs taunting etc. trash talk is part of the game kids even whisper things to their opponents or make gestures when playing competitive sports.  Anyone that truly knows basketball could tell in the first half that LSU had much better players at every position playing with IQ and controlling the game with faster pace.  LSU was up 13 points already with Clark hitting 7 threes in the first half she was on fire playing lights out and Iowa was still down double digits in the end LSU almost won by 20 points.   Salute to both teams for all of the hard work and dedication yall gave us a great show!!!!!
Iowa kind of got dominated. Their defense looked weak and they didn’t match LSU’s passion.
se ve el enojo pero desde la mitad se notó quien estaba dominando
someone needs to humble angel
Wow LSU locked Caitlin down in the second half she couldn't get a look at the bucket Salute
Caitlin Clarke is a beast and she is truly an assassin on the court but you know basketball in the scenes for it ask Michael Jordan he found out the hard way you need a team to win championships someone got to do the Dirty Work play tough defense and help you be great the only thing Caitlin Clarke knees is someone to help her win championship other than that she's a great individual it seemed to be a great person
Caitlin Clark is NBA material.  True point!  This girl is off the charts.  Look out WNBA! Sneaker deals coming young lady!!
Amazing
Ok so am trying to understand this white house invitation controversy.  Are LSU members black and the other team white?
Those commentators was really rooting for Iowa lol
They’re really talented teams. I only saw one good defensive play, but they’re good shooters.
sheit..these hoes can shoot
🦾🏀🎹🎹🎹🎹
Even tho they won by that much it was a shoot out good game
It's a parade inside my city YEAH ! GREAT JOB LSU
Where is the dunk? Passing was great.
Wow, what a game. Both teams played amazing, but LSU was unstoppable. What a 3 point shooting festival. These ladies are great players. I'm impressed it's my first time watching women's basketball and it was amazing 👏 👌
They act like boys nothing else and have stupid attitudes.
Watching 👀 the way LSU was playing there's no way Iowa was going to defeat them. And Jasmine Carson, her first half performance was amazing. Why would a losing 😫 😪 😢 😩 team receive an invite from the White House 🏠 🤔 🙄?
LMAO !!! With all these white women having mixed children , THERE IS NO WAY THIS LSU TEAM  WAS  ABOUT TO LOSE THIS GAME..... I SEE WHY IT WAS INTENSE BECAUSE BOTH TEAM ARE VERY SEGREGATED
Wow!!!! These women can ball. Both teams aren't no joke but LSU was in a zone. Entertainment off the chain 🔗.
Congrats LSU sistas!
So clark ain’t splashing 😂
You can be the greatest player all you want nobody wins without a team not even Michael Jordan Kobe Lebron Taurasi etc.
Bruh This Was Some Serious Basketball 😮 All Those 3's...... 😳
Iowa ran the same play! Screen for Clark!! Their big girls were tired! LSU played there game perfectly, contain Clark and the game is over!! Geaux Lady Tigers!
I love Angel, I love everything about her, I love every decision  she makes on and off the court ✊🏾💯
Baby the Lady Tigers were busting them three's  on fire they did that
Lsu dominated the paint ,Iowa got shooters
This was a good game 🔥
Carson and Clark really stood out, Reese honestly showed that without her height and size she’d be an average player
This was EPIC!!!! Congratulations Ladies!!! Very well deserved!!!!
Felt like the team with the Blake girls were better at basketball than the team with the wyatt girls
Haven't seen a game like this in the WNBA yet...... Sign all of them now I'll watch these two go at it.
Them 3s big time player teamClark
That Clark girl is the best player out there if she had a better team she would be unstoppable
With the introduction of NIL’s in Collegiate Sports, the WNBA is in hot water! The NCAA Women’s Tournament has now eclipsed the WNBA…
"She is just fictional at this point."  Gotta give Ryan Rucco a shout-out for that call. That was great.   But so happy for LSU! CONGRATULATIONS TIGERS!!!
Lol why did it look like  a black bd white situation 😂
Yooo... They popping them 3's off... So did Angel and Jill cause a bunch of men to suddenly watch women's basketball? I think so. 😂
Jasmine Carson is a fkn bucket🔥
Who’s that Carson whooo really a good player to watch 👌👌😅Clark Clark great shooter
the moment i saw they wore kobe6 i knew its game over for Iowa.
Best women’s basketball game ever!
better than WNBA
PWP vie 800wok dad 500hame dad Aubri dad 500hame dad dad is going to call dad dad 500hame dad dad is going to call dad dad 500hame Aubri 300hams mom900
They look better than the guys no lying.
Who cares next year it'll be a different team there celebrating don't waste you're breath you're not important.
that little white girl is helpless i felt bad for her her team scare cuz the chicks out of lousiana crazy . theres was no hand shake  at end not good sign for the game
Never thought I would say this, but this game was better than any WNBA game I've ever watched!!!
WHITE FOLKS HURT 🤣 thought big nose would beat a team full of black woman ??? Yaaa ok
Chick-fil-A vs Popeyes basketball game 😂
Wow, LSU tore their mouths out!  Had to come here bc of the hype yet thus game was so good and LSU hitting those vaskets that Ll critics look stupid and racists at this point
Why did they ever start putting this stuff on television it's just School sports female that
Best game I've ever seen male or female they put on a clinic
Yoo CARSON was on fire 👏👏
I don't even like basketball. I just watched it for the black vs white narrative. 🤷🏽
Congratulations LSU
LSU was clicking on all cylinders and TRUSTED each other. Total team effort but Jasmine Clark was in straight up cheat code mode and I LOVE IT. She is the heroine of this game. Congratulations Lady Tigers!!!!
I don’t usually like basketball but I’m glad we won lol
I got chills. That's one of the best basketball highlights I've watched in a while.
That was a great game by both teams
looked like black girls vs white girls
This Clark girl shooting at curry range
Ladies I Am A Fan Great Game... Just Remember You Win Some And You Lose But You Can Never Stop Being The Best Version Of Yourselves...
#2
This was fun to watch Both teams Balled out !!! MVP was well deserved too …Great win LSU!
Jasmine 🚗 CARSON RUNNING OF UNLIMITED GAS ⛽️ 🏀🐐
Jasmine 🚗 CARSON RUNNING OF UNLIMITED GAS ⛽️ 🏀🐐
💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛
Both of these team where on fire🔥🔥🔥🔥Congratulations LSU🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Is it me or was everyone hyped because this was like “Hoosiers” part 2, the only difference is the outcome. Also this was such a race game black 5 vs white 5…😂
LSU! DID THAT 💩 Congratulations! Ladies you've Earned it..💪🏿✊🏿✌🏿🙏🏾❤🏆
White people don't be mad
I do not watch women's basketball but really looked forward to this game, the officiating was horrible the first quarter, I could not take it anymore. I thought it was my opinion until the next morning on ESPN sportscenter , they declared it was awful officiating. It was enough to throw Iowa off their game which they never got back in the rhythm. Now if it was LSU, it would be a far different outcome.
Carson!!! Is she related to Billy Carson? Bcuz she went alien mode on em! GREAT JOB WELL DONE!
The game was electrifying
Both teams got some snipers… that Caitlyn Clark is like the female version of Curry
What I love about the LSU team is that they are all such demure ladies with charming hairdos. 😂
LSU deserved it , but Clark was carrying that team to the point it was seriously impressive
Bama fan here... LSU... THE BEST!!!!!
UNBELIEVABLE GAME!!....Gotta give it to IOWA though if it wasn't for Carson's contribution in the first half, this would'a gon' different,....what a team!!!
Lsu conquered iowa lets be real 🔥
This dead the biggest smile I ever got watching basketball 😭😭
Clark is a beast she got my respect
All black giant player of LSU vs white dwarf
Clark is freaking problem!!! Lady Steph
Wow Caitlin curry is a freakin sharp shooter. Reese is an animal. I can’t believe I missed this game. These ladies played better than 90% of March madness this year. Hope we see these ladies next year too. Idk what grades they are in. 😂😂
🫨🫨🫨
This game had more views than ALL nba games this year. salute to these ladies and congrats to LSU
Amazing game
LSU was shooting like 2016 warriors that was crazy .. but Clark was taking over and was completely dominate offensively great game
Iowas coach lost the game for them… she only focuses on one player.. basketball is a team sport.. LSU coach out coaches her
Some of the best women basketball we’ve ever seen
Too many weapons 🤔
Caitlyn Clark looked like lebron vs the warriors. Every one from lsu was putting up numbers while it looked like only Clark was getting buckets. Reese should remember this when they both get to the wnba and Clark is considerably more popular paid and better.
Wow that is admirable, keeping an all white team and STILL managing to get to the championship. lol what!?
I literally watched this game about 20 times and I was there in person 💜💛🏀🏆
Congratulations LSU.  What a great game 😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was entertaining.
Amazing
Carson was incredible!
The three where flying
Lsu came with it
Well I guess we can tell who the broadcasters was going for 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel like Iowa really better far as makin plays they just got out played
LSU played as a team and didn’t depend on just 1 or 2 people. That’s why they are champions
You gotta really try hard asl to have a predominantly white basketball squad … just sayin…. Iowa
THIS GAME WAS LITTY👏🏾. LSU WAS ON 1🫡… AND THE JAWN DOUBLE C(CAITLIN CLARK), WAS FVCKIN BALLIN LIKE SHE GOT A BLOCK🧏🏾‍♂️. SHE’S REALLY NICE WIT IT, YOU CAN TELL HOW SHE MOVES WITH THE ROCK
Nothing but respect jersey city
best women’s basketball performance of all time by LSU. They could not miss anything!
Both teams RAWW ASF!! 🎉❤😂 this was a good a** game! Congrats LSU
Man I respect the #22 she played her heart out she wanted so bad I can tell I kno she is heart broken 🙏♥️
The WNBA HAS to push these two superstars. They could respectively be the WNBAs Magic and Larry in terms of saving that league
always nice to see a superstar get beat and humbled
🎩👽🤞🙉💫🧢😁🙏💯🔥💗🙊🙈🤳🤞
A good high school boys team beats them every time.  I am sorry but can't get to excited about high school level basketball.
Shout out LSU!
She threw that three pointer up once you start hitting those types of shots it’s game over period LSU was in there bag 😂
8:15 she made that look so effortless when that was one of the best move and shot I seen a woman make
This girl Clark has a bright future she lights out Steph curry range man
0:38 She celebrated early, cool.
now that's some black girl magic. Don't be sore losers white people. lol 😂😂😂
Iowa needs to learn to play defense. The refs need to learn what traveling is as well.
Dirty
wasnt even that good
Carson 9 for 9 21 points basically in 8 minutes
Man! They came to play no games!!! Congratulations LSU🌸❤️
WNBA is coming up
LSU COACH OF THE YEAR
Great game LSU
LSU dominated!
Very entertaining 🎉
I am now a fan!!🎉🎉
DATS LSU ICE SPICE  DATS LSU ICE SPICE 💦
❤❤❤
So I went back to look at espn high lites . You would have thought Iowa won the game Do better ESPN
This is by far top 5 women’s basketball games of all time. I’m still not a fan of all the lay ups but the 3 point shooting was amazing. Congrats to LSU
Shout out to the bayou sisters
People are just mad a black team wallop a white team lol
Thank you Sistas (LSU) I love you all
Support "Carol's Dream" the book that inspires young ladies to go to college.
Congratulations to LSU but Clark from the other team was balling tho. Shout outs to her
Some of these girls belongs in the NBA
Good squeaky clean win Black queens 👑👑👑 black ✊✊✊
Womens basketball is UNDERRATED😯
LSU Trashiest team ever. Those girls will be street walking soon.
You can see me 🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Cool black girls from Louisiana showed a high-quality master class to white Iowa! Bravo, tigresses!!! Bravo!!!
Never seen a WNBA highlight but here i am watching NCAA women finals .. WOW 😄
Feel like 1979 Larry Bird vs Magic Johnson
The women may not be as strong and athletic as the men, but they appear to be more fundamental sound at shooting the  basketball. Lots of the guys depend too much on their raw talent and don't improve their shooting. That's why so many guys don't even have a good mid- range game, and they suck at free-throws, but for some reason they're trying to shoot the ball like Steph Curry.😄
Dunks. Dunks that’s it, this is basketball folks, and great basketball at that. They need to lower to hoooooops, I’d love to see chicks dunking on one another.
I normally don’t say anything but LSU is playing team basketball 🏀.. Of course the other team is playing as well …. but LSU is passing the Ball ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Idk anything about females basketball, but I couldn’t help but notice this was black vs white.
I'm not a fan of women basketball, but this was a good game.   Both teams were good, but unfortunately, only 1 could win. Congratulations LSU!! #2 was killing those 3s
Great game until the unsportsmanship display by Angel at the end of the game
Great game
These women are so incredibly talented that I am still in awe that both squads were able to score at will.  I can't wait for the WNBA draft of this class.
Ghetto ignant trash
Did you show the part where the racist angel reese was being all racist and stuff? If not that's racism, you racist. Only asking because i have never and will not ever watch espn
Iowa showed out they went all the way just there yet
dang had no idea this was going on lol
Man the WNBA gone crazy the NBA been dryyy forever 😅
Nobody watches women’s basketball and nobody cares not at the college level and not a WNBA
I don't know how many times I've watched the first half. Fire 🔥
Love this game!!!
You think the Mavs gonna make the play in?
Women’s basketball has improved so fast that the Women Refs can’t keep up.
❤
Amazing shooting on both teams!
Good tournament
Congrats
NCAA should be paying Reese and Clark for raising the profile of the sport. It’s not for the purist anymore, now it’s about ENTERTAINMENT!
A win is a win basketball ain't supposed to have class and why do everyone care so much about her doing that you can't see me in the you can't see me girl's face basketball is competitive you have to bring it
Iowa main flaw was literally banking on one player, LSU had a team. There’s the difference, GOOD JOB LSU💛💜
Clark is dude 😂
🙏🏿👍🏿❤️💪🏿👊🏿👋🏿
Blonde afro
What an amazing game! Congratulations LSU🏆 on your very first championship 🏆
This was truly a really good team effort from LSU    good small contributions from some of everyone on the team. CONGRATS LSU !!!
Shoutout to the winner 🥇
Jasmine Carson went stupid🔥🔥
I feel like we just watched miss Jasmine Carson, have the best day of her life 😊 A treat to see!
Clark is amazing. Reece is a man
What would be cool is Reese and Clark would end up on the same WNBA TEAM
Carson 🔥
Jasmine had a night of nights!
See this Angel, Carlin is so much better than you!!!
S/o to them black women 🔥💪🏽
As great as Clark is, LSU is just a better "TEAM" as simple as that.
gamecocks should’ve been there.
Carson is so amazing. I love her. Congrats to these wonderful ladies you deserve the WIN. Celebrate any way you want to. This is your Championship  !!!
If Clark would have passed to her team more instead of being a hog and taking most of the shots they might have had a chance. You can't win a a game by yourself with three pointers. She needs to learn that or it'll be a repeat if she makes it next year.
This game is between white vs black
Better than any wnba highlights I’ve watched
Dang! Lsu destroyed Iowa
If the WNBA consisted of the players from just these 2 teams… I’d watch all 36 games
Women's basketball is lit!
These ladies were balling out!!!good game
Clark the female curry 😂💯💯
The blatant racism shown against the LSU ladies makes me sick. When Clark trash talked she was praised. LSU ladies used her own behavior against her and got attacked for it. Makes me ashamed to be White.
Great game! Jasmine Carson was hot on those 3s, and Angel was great as  usual for LSU! The entire team was amazing, and fired  up to win that championship! Clark was the usual, great one-man show for Iowa!  Unfortunately, it takes an entire team fight to win a championship game. Congratulations  to LSU Tigers!
The most impressive thing about girls basketball is that they can do it with huge hair extensions, fake nails, fake eyelashes and fat arses.  Honestly, it’s just terrible.
That was a good game 🎉❤
Congrats to the LSU Lady Tigers on winning the National Championship, well Deserved!!!!🏀🏀🏀🏀
Congratulations to my beautiful queens 👑👑👑
Crazy how she has brought a lot of attention to woman’s basketball
I know a lot of guys are probably gonna hate me for sayn this but this yr the women basketball championship was betr than the mans and I’m a guy myself i have never seen so many 3 pointers
Was this game kind of us and them between the blacks and whites
The media really knew what they were doing stirring up beef between white vs black women.
Yep.. Caitlin had a great game, but LSU answered anything that she could do. They were simply better than them. Say it with me, "get off the court & who got next?!💯
now women collage got my attention come on wnba smh
They Cheated because they are MORONS
That was awesome!!  Loved to see and hear that crowd.
The ladies ball BETTER than the NBA cats.
Caitlin Clark is the wrong color for some 'folks'.
First time that the women's title game was almost better, if not, than the men's
Wonder how must Lsu paided officials
First time watching a women game and I love it. Angel and Clark....!!!! Nice game. Let these girls be!!!!!!!
THAT was entertaining!!!
Congrats to LSU but that Clark girl is on another level.
Okay see caitlyn ia 3pt shooter they really be giving her to much room and that's why she's scoring so easily but she really be sparking from anywhere glad she got that confidence
hey ESPN can you update the short description here to say "Angel Reese" instead of "Reese Angel"? it looks weird, especially because Jasmine Carson and Caitlin Clark's names are written [first] [last] -- thank youuu
This was actually more fun to watch than some NBA games.
These LSU girls just showed why caitlin clark is a one trick pony, there has been thousands of shooters in college, that went on to the WNBA and NBA and didn't amount to anything because they relied solely on a three point shot...In order from Caitlin Clark to become elite and a star player she needs more tangibles to her game..... You can't be just a shooter, and this is coming from a Iowa fan.
lsu was star 🌟 stuck at first but relaxed plz 9'5 the rim
The end of this video has me in tears lmao
Iowa just couldn't play defense. Seemed like LSU got shots inside and wide open 3's from the outside
That white girl is a straight monster.
THAT CLARK WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR FOR SURE!!!
MAMBA MENTALLY PURPLE N GOLD SOLID 💪
Clark the reason why I’m watching woman basketball
Jasmine Carson ……😮
GREAT job ladies
Why was 3/4 of the highlights  was of the losing team......white America ESPN
Celebration after every bucket lol mad corny but entertaining game nonetheless
LSU💜💛👑💯 FLAU'JAE #4
Y’all forgetting nobody really played defensive 😅… a losing team lost with 85 pts, that’s a lot of points
Great game ❤️‍🔥
Carson’s the one 😍
Iowa depending on a Clark to carry them the whole game is why they lost. When Clark was out, they were taking a beating 😆 (...and no Karen don't correct me on technicalities, it's my first time watching basketball. I came for LSU, Angel, Carson and Clark...)
Ngl, I’m impressed. Woman’s basketball just evolved.
Good game! Congrats to LSU !!!
Man they’ll remember this game for the rest of they lives. 🎉🎉
The whole LSU Team showed up including the coach. Their coach was dressed for the winner's podium.
WERE JUST BETTER.
Dammm that white girl #22 🔥
Ghetto Barbie.  Always angry.  Full of hate.
JOB WELL DONE LADIES.. :)
Its was a splash fest 🔥🔥🔥
LOL, so many paid commments.  If anyone says this was a great basketball game they are lying.  The quality was poor (with some exceptions), officiating was worse, the lack of sportsmanship was a disgrace.
LSU come to play!!!!
our girls played a fantastic game.caitlan clark has nothing over our girls.
LSU AKA Purple Rain
Classic LSU was incredible
The referees was on point😮
Black queens!!!
Sucks to be a lowa fan 🤣😭
When Carson hit the buzzer beater at the half I felt her joy through the phone when she celebrated
This is one the greatest basketball games we've ever seen.   A shooting clinic. Clark is a cold blooded assassin whoa - elite.   Carson was one too
It's Wizardry!!! Love it!💜💛😊  Congratulations LSU!!
ALL DUE RESPECT TO COACH MULKY!!! She is as legendary as the Summit. (Hint-Hint) But for these people to get mad because their GREAT WHITE HYPE team FAILED, and calling LSU women's team names and slurs... I am GLAD they won!  Hopefully, coach MULKY can repeat this success again!
So no one noticed the devil symbolism on the floor
One day woman’s sports is gonna be more appealing to men than watching men🤣
Very good game. That Clarke girl is a baller.
Coaches in all other sports are not aloud on playing surface.NCAA got any answers.
Kiiickkkkk rrrooooockkkkkkk Iowa!! 😂😂😂
Why was Reese named mvp? 😂 She didn’t play the best
What a game. Good for LSU.
All this game show me was that when it comes to white vs black the world is more interested and want to see there race whoop the other, than this whole we are all the same and we all bleed red quotes that people like to say because it sounds right but deep down they don’t believe it.
I’m glad bigots mad 😂
Iowa: We’re going to win.  LSU: We don’t plan on losing.  That’s sums it up.
How many licks until you get to the center?
WOW!  I think the women’s basketball pay scale just went up🤑
This game was a classic.
These two young ladies are warriors on the court trash-talking and teasing is part of the game,race shouldn't  be. Respect did it for the girls that walk the walk and talk the talk that looks like her. Trash talk is part of the game and always will be
INSANE!!!
All white girl basketball team? Now that wasn't fair.
Why didn't they show the hand pose from Angel??? GUARANTEED if Iowa won and Caitlin did it, then that would be the thumbnail! But we know how the media is, lol
Imagine if Iowa had 5 good players that are tall like lsu, there would be no chance for Lsu if Clark had good teammates, 🤔 overall Clark 1v1 any of them she would dominate
Tiktok just send me here😅😅, Angel Rees and other short stories
Thank Curry for giving the woman the three points to  build off.  Cause if they make the three ball the main attraction to the game it will be more entertaining to watch . Them deep three's be like a woman Dunkin to me  Clark was killing it by herself she breaking WNBA recorded
I love Angels euro straight hair
CONGRATULATIONS 🎊 👏 💐 🥳 LSU! BLACK GIRLS MAGIC!
Always bet on BLACK ❤
jasmine carson hoop like a chill james harden😅
Iowa ant have enough niggas on their lineup Clark can ball tho lsu was lightning up tho
Don’t start what you can’t finish.
2:54 Iowa was doing shidd like this the whole game that’s why LSU had to tap that azzzzzzz 😂
Lmao I just seen this look it’s black vs whites 😂😂😂
Just here to show love for LSU and Caitlyn Curry. This was a great game and I hope that these young ladies can advance to the WNBA and bring some of that excitement to that level.
Congrats LSU first entertains women game I’ve watched 🔥🐐💯
Lol
AWESOME 👍😎
Good lord LSU got hot and it seemed Iowa was giving them the outside shot.
LSU❤
THE BEST PLAYER IN THE HISTORY OF WOMENS BASKETBALL..BETTER SHOOTER THAN THE MEN WAS TARGETED AND FOULED OUT...A DISGRACE..NO TECHNICAL FOUL FOR THE CLASSLESS PLAYER FOR TAUNTING BUT A TECHNICAL FOUL FOR NOTHING ON IOWAS STAR PLAYER! WORST OFFICIALS IN HISTORY! I DONT LIKE THE WAY THIS LOOKED! IT LOOKED LIKE THEY FAVORED THE BLACK PLAYERS INTENTIONALLY PERIOD! A DISGRACE..THEY COULDNT STAND A REPEAT OF ANOTHER TEAM BEING SHOWN UP BY KATE
Them YT people mad afff 🤝🏾
women basket ball suck it can never be equal with men. just like they can never have a testicle between their legs. that prove their not equal
Wow - women’s basketball on a hundo now sheesh that was crazy
Them women battling crazy
The Sistas brought that heat! Congrats LSU!
Caitlin Clark is a wonderful basketball player but LSU was consistently hitting on all cylinders.
They took off with that lead and never looked back Lsu total domination
I see why the Bidens want Iowa to come to the White House. They look like the pictures on the wall of the White House
Both teams played great !! Shout out to LSU for the flawless victory ! Caitlin Clark was trying to win it but needed her team to be there with here
Insane shooting. Who the heck are these women??
These girls I would pay too watch people this is passion this is what we wanna watch that dog that fight until the end an u girls got it on both ends both teams got dawgs running around my bayou girls thanks for   bringing the chip home LSU home of the death valley tigerssss u better knoe itttt
22 needa go to the warriors
Caitlin Clark is the only woman who can make me watch a womens basketball game. She can have a much bigger impact on the game than jordan hawkins cousin. The only other thing i paid attention to relating to womens basketball is britteny griners arrest. I gotta give credit. Caitlin clark convinced me to watch a womans basketball game
Clark plays like Steph 😯
This was an exciting game!!! Geesh!! Like all the player's stats were 100. Three, Three, Three, Three, geeshh!!!!!
I can see the WNBA using these two women as the Magic & Bird of their sport, if they were smart they would…..
Unfortunately in America seeing these beautiful classy talented young Black shinning stars defeat a predominantly all white team evoked the typical anti Black racism that defines white culture in America and globally.  I applaud these beautiful Black young ladies for their victory and their unapologetic willingness to stare white supremacy directly in the face and say YOU CANT SEE ME!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Congrats Iowa, can’t wait to see y’all at the White House…
Carson hard
Im wondering why I wanna cry watching this?
U.S. college basketball better than the PBA.
Reese lookin like Sid the Sloth
That's what guys want to see! Tough PLAY!! Loved the effort and energy. Definitely gonna watch and keep track next  season! Great Job LSU ladies and congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watching 45 for Iowa run the court is a thing of beauty.  Young lady can run.
2:30 Clark traveling...
This was my first time watching a women's basket ball game ever. I loved it
Hahahahah Clark! Your medicine doesn’t taste good. You can’t see LSU
Steph curry is somewhere smiling 😂
Angel Reese played a great game but she has no class. Made herself look like a stupid punk at the end.
There goes the hype for Caitlin Jenner :(
When you shoot the 3, aren't you supposed to leave your hand in the air... Not throw it back up to show off 😂 girls sports is so funny.
LSU !
Women basketball pls no 🤮🤮🤮
You ladies did great! Shout out to the champions!💜

BLACK MAGIC
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 LSU
Clark has zero help. LSU had the whole team. They played amazing
Not gunna lie !! This made me a fan of women’s basketball! Good job !👏🏽
Tiger bait
Congratulations to all the contenders shout out to all da fans
Don Imus, Don Imus!
This Final match did a lot more for women's Basketball than anything before, congrats to both teams.
It's women's basketball, guys.  Just a pack of monkeys
Jasmine Carson was on fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Congratulations
Jasmine Carson outplayed Clark
Great work
Can take the trash out if the street but cab not remove the HOID lium out of the trash
WCB>WNBA
they all move like austin reaves
People still watch stupid sportsball?
Now I see the problem with this angel Reese and Caitlin girl. Race is playing a big part in this dispute.
This was a big win for women's basketball both college and wnba. I saw great defense, passing and shooting. Great individual talent as well!
Congratulations LSU
What a game🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Carson is nice also. Caitlin deserves the respect she has
More interesting than the WNBA
Now, i will still watch the Bird & Taurasi Show next FF, i had been distracted just enuf, from watching that Broadcast, that i was totally unawares of the taunting feud starting with Clark vs. SC. Only from watching ATH today, did i learn of it. I'd just like to suggest that any men who happened to comment on this, just to condemn women doing what men do all the time, well, they need to keep their piehole shut for a change, and let the women figure this out for themselves! PS: i might not have been as supportive of Clark had i been aware of any of that??
who cares
A wise man once said "Where are all the feminists!?" Perhaps they finally showed up...took a dude to point It out. Now let's get this in WNBA levels.
Welcome to 10Tr ❤❤❤Sub! 🌹❤✋👍
I’ve never watched women’s ball before, but this was an entertaining tournament.
They was  going at it... neck & neck great game ladies👏🏿🎊👍🏿👌🏿
Sorry but if you have more white players, I'm betting against you hahhahahhaha
Let this be the Pros for women... Let these billion $$$ schools pay them. Axe the WNBA
They showed no class at all
Nah, this legendary.  This game looked fun
Police need to put extra patrols on schools to protect children as we all know what pale americans do when they get mad 😂😂😂
Man Carson was 💯🥰🥶🔥🔥🔥
Iowa had no athleticism, had to rely on the three ball way too much
I love how grown adults hijacked this amazing opportunity for women’s basketball and turned it into a race war
Man they weren't guarding cc
Wth I thought we had a legitimate case, TCU vs GA, Iowa had no business out there... Clark 3 is dangerous off the screen, however that's all she haves... not yet diverse enough...
Y’all know why I’m here!!
Thank God you beat that balding Clark
Bro this was actually 🔥
Lower the rim to 9 and have them dunk on each other would take wnba to next level...smaller ball, shorter 3s. Why not just lower rim
Jasmine Carson woah! 🤩
BALLIN!!!!
I don't normally follow womens bball but this was fun.. shootn the lights out. Carson & Clark are money.
Yoo I was just thinking to myself, man this Flau'jae girl looks so familiar.. Turns out she was on The Rap Game a few years ago (a younger girl then) and she even has a record deal + a championship now! That's crazy! Never know the path God has for you!
I’m so excited that the media got to help spread women’s basketball and racism to another level.   Thank you espn.
Clarke looks like a dude 😂😂😂
God dam this was some fun ****** basketball to watch.. Holy cow.
They shooting like Steph curry
Ghetto trash
I love watching the ladies play.  I have no, problem with the trash talk! Thats B Ball on the street level
i can't believe all these "Johnny Come Lately's" talkin about "I can't believe ...blah blah blah"...You're 10 years late...go crawl back under the rock you came from...WE DON'T NEED YOUR APPROVAL..NEVER DID...FOH...nah, i take that back..i shoulda said it like this G.T.F.O.H. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I mean a team full of karens against a team filled with shaniquas is a obvious outcome!!! There just better ballers 😂
What a game. Both teams were super awesome.
With alm the bull they not giving these women there credit this game was better than the men’s ijs🤷🏿‍♂️💯💯💯💪🏿
That was quite the suit the LSU coach was wearing Tiger stripes covered 100% in sequins.
This game was so lit bra like common they can all shot better then some NBA players no cap
this was an amazing game
Clarke and Reese, no Jasmine Carson was the MVP
I give it to both teams because they looked better than men's on that court nothing but love for the lady's ❤
Iowa needed a little bit of humble pie. See yall next year.
LSU girls!number 1 in grace not contempt, vengeance etc...
Ice spice in ha mood
Way more entertaining than the wnba.
A lot of girls can shoot but to do it with GRACE.....is the  thing.stop finger pointing get a pacifier instead of a mouthpiece Angel?????really???
Grow up! instead of taking this opportunity to show grace,she showed contempt. This is someone enrolled in higher learning. The sad thing us she doesnt evten get it.
I love the coach's outfit!!!!
This is legit entertainment. Can’t wait too see what there careers will be like. I like this.
Congratulations to both teams, they played an exciting game and I wished it lasted longer.
Reese is what we called “burnt toast in our hood” I’m just saying white girl outscored her 🤷‍♂️
Carson ❤
Is that ball a 🎈😂😂 it was flying like a piece of paper
Best team by far won!!! LSU!!!🎉🎉🎉
They shld just declare womens college basketball the new wnba and watch it get commercial success
That was the most entertaining woman's basketball game I have ever seen!!!!
Clark with 3 fouls before half time hit, rough. Good game!
0:52 impressive to see  👌🏼
Poor sportsmanship at the end.   Just pathetic
Geaux Tigers
I GUARANTEE  one or more of the refs had tens of thousands of dollars on LSU to win.
How the girls play 4 qt and the guys play 2qt? lol.
wnba better than NBA in basketball. i said what i said🎉
Great Game LSU Clark is TRANSGENDER AND STILL LOST 😂😂😂
LSU turned the game into a track meet and ran them right off the court. They couldn’t deal with that speed.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Amazing game, shots were one for the ages, on both sides.
Congratulations lsu❤❤❤❤
Clark is a savage bruh. She can seriously ball. LSU just played better and earned that dub. Great work ladies!!!
That was a good game
Lol this remind me of that movie “Bring it on” but women’s college basketball version 🔥🔥🔥
Clark still owns womens basketball
Reese is tall asf I love it❤❤
Carson is Iowa’s new Mommy! 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
All these backboard shots and I'm not hearing nobody call GLASS 😒
Aw yes, the white vs the black. Classic battle
Them LSU girls are really real! Everybody showed up… can’t front, Clark is nice tho
This was like a Cavs vs warriors final but without kyrie type of year
Here for Clark #22 ❤
thank you for posting!!
Carson SHOWED UP on the biggest stage of her career so far 😎
This game was by far the most entertaining game I've seen in a long time.
how was she allowed to play after assaulting a player after the playoff game?  She's not a good example of what sportsmanship should be.
Just my observation, but it seems like they always showed a front picture of CC when she scored but very few (if any) of the players for LSU when they scored.  Great game!
Refs won the game for.lsu wonder how much they got paid off for that....
Iowa was the better team...just not this game.  Iowa would win 2 out of 3.
Has anyone else noticed the LsU coach outfit?  Also the lack of defensive skill is ridiculous on both ends. So many open unnecessary 3 pointers
225🎉🔥
Iowa could not defend because of foul trouble. The refs ruined Iowa's game!
This is more exciting then the WNBA...
Girls basketball development is crazy , gets better by the year I know this is college but there’s clearly multiple future WNBA stars on this court &  hopefully soon the girls its good enough that the nba recommends dual tickets 1 night , 2 games , women’s (WNBA) would play first then the men’s (NBA) would play last , not only would that attract more attention to the WNBA but it also gives them more exposure and opportunities with player merch sales and more , I hope they look into it this way for the future 😅‼️
Is that a transgender on the Iowa team? or am I tripping?
The administration wants to invite both LSU and Iowa to the White House. In a related announcement, the administration wants both teams in the Super Bowl to get an identical and equally important Lombardi Trophy and be declared co-winners of the game.
Clark is too dangerous
Why am I starting to love woman's basketball more then the men's... CARSON is the main reason they won .. checking for her from how on ...kind of seems like the IOWA team is cheered by the white ppl .. LSU by the black ppl .. AR is from bmore .. im from dc..so of course  I'm routing for  LSU
All of these comments seem generated. Weird.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Carson was amazing! Trash Barbie I will just forget
This will probably go down in history as one of the greatest games ever
Ballin! These ladies showed out...gotta love it.
Hey watching the men's final . Noticed the men play the inside passing game but the women play the outside 3 point game . Anyone agree .
First time watching any type of women’s basketball very entertaining tho
These girls played bwoii
LSU was the better team tho, I was routing for Iowa💯 I'm not sour tho, I'm excited to see how Angels and Carson's future ends
I hate to say it but Kaitlyn Clark was the only really good player Iowa had, no disrespect to Iowa.. Clark just sees the game different
Angel & Carson!!!! Best college march madness duo?? Think about it
Jasmine Carson deserves her flowers 💖🤘🏼💯
WP are so mad bc the blk girl trashed talked a wgirl on the court, showed where her ring was going. WP don't get that mad when kids are shot up at schools with powerful assault rifles. With all the problems going on in US, WP are mostly angry at a blk bball player. WP have such shallow lives, they need sports to prove they're better than BP.
That first lsu bucket was stüp!d crispy!!!😮‍💨
Kaitlyn Clark is literally the next version of curry were gonna see for awhile
This was such a great game to witness
Angel Reese aka Stygimoloch!
I just gotta say I really enjoyed that game. Didn’t care who won. Some great shooters on both sides
Idc what anyone says, Clark is gonna be a supernova for real in her own right
Yea I'm going to need some dykes to take over the WNBA. I'm bored
LSU coach looking like she is at a wild party
Angel & Caitlyn are beast!
Congrats to lsu but they girl Clark is going to be special 🔥🔥🔥
Women lol
Caitlin Clark wow
Game looked like a pseudo race war lol
Sideshow Bob 😂
Why most LSU made up of black and lowa made up of white
No Caitlyn🤦‍♀️
IOWA needs more seasoning on  the team lol ,bring some black girls with  athleticism
Clark was emptying the clip from the three😂😂😂🔥Carson showed up big time💯good game overall
I have never watch any college basketball games male or female in my life but I can clearly see IOWA lacks athleticism. LSU girls are faster, stronger and nimble on their feet .
Both teams are good but the best won!
Nice LSU
the last few years have been awesome for women’s bball the sport is growing.
Awesome game
Over the last 4 years I've been watching more and more womens sport. The sports have been what you would call " not mainstream " to American audiences. Like Womens Rugby, Soccer, Australian Fules Football.  Not as technicle or as physical as the mens games, but as exciting and captivating as the mens. For instance Last years Womens Rugby World Cup final, It would rank as the best game of rugby last year. This game looked to have been as exciting as anything I've looked at this year.
Can’t blame Carson acting that way. That’s their culture and the way they’re taught and raised. No shocker w/ her behavior
Buckets everywhere! 🤎💫
What a great game
Jasmine Carson was the best I saw in that game. She was on fire!!  I loved it!!
I've never seen any team shoot lights out like that, women or men. NBA men don't even shoot like that for a more than a quarter at a time. The one who had 22 only had 11 during her whole playoff run before that game. It was such a freak game.
It’s cool when they do it it’s a problem when I do it
To all the younglings watching.  Hustle hard and stay humble.
You can’t see me 👋🏾
I WOULDNT B SURPRISED IF CLARKE AND REESE END UP ON THE SAME WNBA TEAM
Ghetto trash
Beautiful
L S U Deal with It
You can be illiterate and go to LSU, so you can spend all day in the gym.  Unfortunately, and then get paid in the WNBA with my tax money with bailouts.
Mas magaling pa sa PBA magtres tong mga to haha
IOWA is a class act!
Hey ESPN GameDay announced ers (clueless???)  KU men's basketball has won the national championship 4 times.....not twice!  Go back to selling shoes and get some professional on there!
Never bet against black!
No one cares because no one watches women’s basketball lol
Y'all have been introduced to the BOOT 👍🏿
Girls was hoopin!
They say Clark through the lane got bumped! Where?😂
Beautiful basketball all around by LSU. Congrats Tigers!
Ncaa womens final more lit than wnba finals.
morris was letting clark score
LSU. Bunch of classless cocky showboat.
LSU did that
A team full of white girls can never beat a team full of sisters especially when they play together
Literally no one cares!
Bam Tigers brought the heat. Iowa needs to reload. Bring it back.
There’s some sad people here but Clark doesn’t know how to defend. They got beat tf up. Better hit the gym cus tigers stay ready 🤣
Better to be lucky than good.
Clark is Lethal 💉
Carson ✅💚✅
LSU with the mamba mentality 🐐
You’re not stopping Caitlin Clark from making her 3s, but we did close that paint completely down! Those extra points she usually gets in the paint would have put her over 40! But I think she only had one shot made in the paint all night. Defense wins championships! Geaux 🐅s
Great game🔥🔥
Wow just wow
Who juiced they 3 point shot to max stats 🤔 😆
Congratulations ladies 🙌🏾 big #4
Peep the commentators/reporters table at @7:04 lol!!
Angel Reeves is the GLOAT
Doubt they could beat an all merchant team 🤝👃
They won because of racism!!!!!! 👨🏿‍🦲✊🏿
LSU got a whole squad of Lethat talent shooting percentage out the roof 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❕❕❕❕❕❕
For some reason it just made me sad to think Gigi bryant should be playing in this stage.
it smells like catfish in here...
Reese her!!!
The (LSU's) women's basketball version of Michigan's Fab Five.
The REFS CALLS WERE EMBARRASSING AND NOT CONSISTENT NOT A IOWA  FAN
This looks more nba game then the wnba
God Be The Glory. Congratulation to all my LSU Sisters. This for the HOOD!
Well done, Tigers! Big time win!
Nah women’s college basket ball is lit.
I could watch this all day every day and still get goosebumps each time
Jasmine Carson comes off the BENCH and scores 21 FIRST HALF POINTS , ARE YOU KIDDING ME !
The playmaking by angel Reese is so underrated she’s making all these passes Clark make…Reese is an elite rebounder
This game had an opportunity to be great and bring new fans in for woman's NCAA basketball and woman's basketball in general! Two great teams and at points a great game.  Unfortunately, refs with terrible egos and a need to be "in charge" and center stage, took away from this game and made it less than it could have been.  I hate this for basketball in general.  We need these ego maniac refs gone from sports!!
omgg they hoop better than the dudes it feel like I’m watching a 3pt contest 😳
Bro that Iowa team was 1 black girl short of a championship 🤣🤣🤣 that girl Clarke is the truth she was really tryna hoop mixtape them girls
Her words:  Ghetto Barbie couldn't help but become ghetto.  Her words, by the way.   Unsportsmanlike idiot.  She ruined it for herself, the team, and potential fans.   Even if it was a win, that act of poor winning behaviour will always hang over the entire team.  Winners, yet losers...as I predicted.    Also, how did she do in her College English classes.  Pass?  Fail?  Doesn't matter?  What a joke.
My white girl still scored 30 😅 her team aaashhgg
Carson got no flowers 💐 she went off 🔥
Great game..both teams outstanding...lsu was not intimidated by iowa team nor Clark...Clark is a great player..she shows that..she is NOT unbeatable..she does show attitude That no it couldn't be me...sort of cocky disbelief that she could not gave committed a foul..or call did not go her way...per iowa coach..she got out coached...iowa coach didn't have the grit To callenge the referee's on calls...felt like the announcers was pulling for iowa...most of there talk was Clark Clark Clark this and that..iowa iowa this and that...till it became apparent lsu was going to win the game... LSU brought there game.. aggressive Style play...Clark reacted like spoil child at end of game...with expression rejection that they lose game...because she is catling Clark...bottom line iowa got BEAT.... BOTH GREAT TEAMS....
Those women can shoot!
I’ve always been a “someone’s gotta win and someone’s gotta lose” fan.  Congrats to LSU for their win but I find it disheartening also as Angel Reese’s behavior was so disrespectful and such a show of unsportsmanlike conduct, it really should shame the LSU team.  It’s tragic when there’s one bad apple that ruins the whole bunch.  If a winner was to be determined by sportsmanship…LSU would never have won this game.
Glad to see Iowa get beat up. Glad the National Title is back with a SEC team. Congratulations to the LSU Lady Tigers 💜🤍💛
Cool when y’all it do problem when we do it  …. Good Job humbled mouths say less
Who keep saying that. THREEEEEEEEEEEEEH! 😂😂😂
Refs whistle been very busy the entire game. Lol . But other than that exciting game , first time to watch womens basketball. They can hoop for sure and awesome performance to both teams
Man this game right here was entertaining 😂 man I have never been on the edge my sear
❤man those youngins balled out great game
They threw them 3"s on them as well
The Ref's win   now back to reffing junior high
Let the ladies dunk the ball 🏀
Them girls was ballin'!
Hey LOOK     ,    it's your typical rib ssssssucking watermelon slurping POS.....  BALL BOUNCERS
First Womans Basketball game i watced in like 20 years. I get we wanna Pat them on the Back, but it was hard to watch until i told myself it ain the Men. Dont expect Dunks or layups converted. NO WAY this deserves equal pay. Was a good game tho, was like a highschool feel. ImO
ALL THE RACIST CAME OUT!
I never watch lady planet ball but this was the best game over
5:34 Clark got bumped by who? I’m just curious 🤣
That was intense
Nobody cares
That. Carson. Girl. Is. Serious. Good. Player. Love. The. Game
Great finals
Hope Clark hits the portal and comes to LSU 😂
Those beautiful sisters were on it tonight
Carson had great awareness and shooting form
Despite of all the nonsense that circulating through social media…I hope both stars play on the same WNBA team! Great game ladies.👍🏾
Ngl #22 for Iowa was CRANKING DEEM SHITS 💯💯💯💯
These refs clearly put their thumbs on the scale... it's the elephant in the room as to why.  It's a lie to say things couldn't have been different with fair officiating. We need mature unbiased refs next time.
6:50 yes it is commentator yes it is
Everyone was hyped with Iowa and clark?? That was a sht show 😂 a bunch of 3s and no real basketball from them. Good job LSU
The replay are all for Iowa.  Espn seems bias.
Na cause why LSU Just snap like that tho🤦🏽‍♂️😂💯💯💯
Geaux Tigers!!
First time I've ever clicked on a women's basketball highlight video.... that was dope.
Caitlyn Clark could not guard Jasmine Carson.
You cannot leave someone that open !!!!! Too much space and the motion offense was not crisp !!!!! Oh it was a great run IOWA !💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛 If Van Lith could transfer to Iowa  oh 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Them Young Black Queens gave the girls a Spanking 😅
That was a phenomenal game!!!!!
THAT WAS CRAZY! THEY BOTH PLAYED THEIR HEARTS OUT BUT LSU WAS HITTING FROM EVERYBODY AND EVERYWHERE!
An extremely amazing game!!!! Good sportsmanship, they gave the world a game to watch!!! These ladies put in work & it showed tremendously!!! Congratulations LSU🎉🎊🎉
SEC all day!!
This comment section is propaganda trash... lol
Men’s basketball college or professional, have gotten lazy.  Obviously, women basketball definitely hasn’t.
5:20  5:39  6:45 - 6:55  10:19  11:30  11:17  4:45  4:57  3:03
The female Lakers vs Celtics, back in the Magic Bird era
Oh, these girls are going to propel college b ball. Maybe they can help the WNBA.  Officiating? They should be fired or at least scolded sternly. Both sides of the ball. Terrible.
Clarke can BALL!
HaHaHaHA 2nd Team <>Kicked that@$$... ESPN falled you NCAA  freudian...hahaha all over the place!
This might have been the best women's basketball game ever played. Those girls came to play yesterday.
LSU for life
I'm upset I didn't watch this game 🤬
#10  for LSU is totally classless. A real genuine POS.   Her taunting of Clark with all her hand and facial gestures gets her the prize of the year for a really bad actor.
Not shakiness hands AND Flipping people off… z not z good. DOT
Clark going to be dangerous in the WNBA she got that  Steph Curry type shot
CC Is the best player on the floor LSU just had the better team
This game changed women’s  basketball fr, sold out seats for the 1st time & most talked about game😮‍💨…I’m following their careers
Iowa some bums 😂
That was exciting to watch ...Clark the female version of steph Curry n Angel Reese the female LeBron James
First time watching a Women’s Championship game and Man was it worth it!! Great Basketball!
Jasmine Carson when crazy!!!💯
Kim Mulkey reminds me of Bill Murray’s character from the movie Kingpin
👍
EVERYBODY talks about LSU being a TEAM but I don’t see DIVERSITY.
LSU was just too good 😫😩😂😂😂
Unlucky Iowa. Those girls will never shoot like that again in their lives.
Although the refs were horrible, I don’t think the bad calls really impacted the game because lsu were nailing those 3’s like nothing!!    I believed lsu last night could have beaten most wnba teams and probably even the pistons and rockets!    😂😂😂😂
Clark is so good. She needed help for sure
Reese is a Killer of race relations
They'd better enjoy it now while it lasts because women's college basketball is way better than the WNBA, nobody watches the WNBA
if you're just heaving up 3's and bank them in, you know the game is yours. 😆
Caitlin Clark has no clutch, she was a no show in the championship game when it mattered most. Carson from lsu was hot hitting every 3 she put up
The one on the left looks like Westbrook wearing a blonde wig
What's wrong with that lady's eyes that taunted? Does she have some kind of disease? Really brave of her to go on TV looking like that.
i didn’t watch the game but these highlights make it look like it was clark vs lsu lol
This is a joke. Coverage of womens sports! ESPN has gone WOKE.
The LSU coach could have run onto the court and punched Caitlin Clark in the face, and the officials still would have charged Clark with the foul 💀
Camera only showing Iowa😊
Clark was supposed to be the white savior
😂😂😂😂
Iowa started 5 white girls against 5 sisters. What you thought they was like that because SC had a bad night
Number 22 play exactly like curry
Well deserved 🐐🔥🔥
This was fire
can we be honest about the elephant in the room?
Washed ‘em
One can see the influence that Curry has had on almost every play.
Chris Rock said it first - Selective Outrage 😕
Classless
Why did "Carson"stop launching those long range 💣's
😂
Angel Reese is a G! I need that image on a tshirt!
I'm proud of them. Go Tigers!
Iowa was cheated by the refs!
no one gaf
@2:33 is that a travel ? She definitely has a jumper just looks like she travels a lot
the 3pt line the same as men basketball? these girls don’t miss
First time watching WB .Love Angel
this was a good tournament, especially the final four, LSU and Iowa are great teams and played a great game but it was overshadowed a bit by one of the worst reffed games I've seen all year
Why wasn't the fake lashes barbie talking smack early in the game?
#55 Poole must be a known brick
Caitlan CURRY
I love the double standards by the genetic mutation brass. You can't see me🖐 competitor, champion, team player, beautiful, etc. You can't see me 🖐🏾 selfies, loser, monkey, ugly n-bomb etc.
If the wnba could create a vibe like this I would watch ngl
Carson pulling dat mf like its a tooth sheeshhhh good game for both teams 😭💯 my first time watching female basketball nd im impressed
LSU was in God mode.
4:07 i thought she was bout to dunk
Congratulations LSU Tigerettes.  You ladies played an awesome game.
Nice circus show!! LSU was very classless and it started with their leadership!
Wnba needs to get rid of that stupid three year rule these girls are better than the women in the wnba
That was A great game both teams did good
If the WNBA was like this, I’d watch it all the time
Is woman’s basketball actually entertaining
5:38 sent chills down my spine. She got nothing but ice in her veins
Travel at 2:35 for sure gotta watch those feet boiiii
This was like East St Louis Vs Belleville 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🫡💪🏾❤️💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🏆Salute LSU Lady Tigers!!!
These girls can ball my God!!!!
I knew it was over when I seen a black team and a white team
F$$K the r@cists
💜💛💪🏿🥇✍🏿
Great Game. Not so much the celebration. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Listen LSU wanted this game!!!😂😂😂😂
YEEAAAAAAA
They were balling both teams. Clark was doing everything she could for her team but lsu was better that night. Reese and Carson was balling great game.
LSU was amazing!!! Who would have thought that the losing team would have 85pts, but 102pts was too much. LSU exploded.
Kobe was with them cause now way
LSU'S coach is a whack job, love it. 😂😂😂 Bobby Knight Jr
Congratulations LSU! 😎 Thank You Much Iowa State Hawkeyes You Represented The Big Ten Well, And I'm Proud Of You All. ❤❤❤❤ 😎
Iowa fans are sore losers
I hate that Angel Reese is getting more coverage than the actual game because Jasmine Carson put in all time performance yesterday
Them Tigers kicked butts😂
Love how refs was fair and just let them play…no bias
SOME people knew exactly where Angel was coming from!! What she was REALLY saying was: Caitlyn wants to play "big & bad" for the 📸 but "we" know you're not "built" like that! & if you want to "try us" we can meet up in those "streets" without the  📸's rolling!! Then Caitlyn went to the press conference & acted like she wasn't paying attention!!!🤔😂🤔😂
Question how lsu have the better record but number 3 behind them🤔
Best ballers out of a New York hood vs. A D1 homeschooled team. This was a WAR
Trending should of been class in session
CLARK this CLARK that....CLARK LOST..
Boosie said Larry bird come get your daughter they dead #22 clark lowa 😆 🤣 😂
if it wasn't for Jasmine you wont be sitting up there.
What an incredible game!! Congrats to Iowa on a great season and to LSU for stepping up big time and winning this game decisively!   I see so many comments like “I’ve never watched women’s games before now” or “if more players were like Clark , I would’ve been watching more women’s games.” On one hand , it’s awesome to see how the game is gaining more fans and reaching a wider audience. On the other hand, as someone who has been watching women’s ncaa ball for years , I know the game has BEEN had some true ballers. No disrespect to Caitlin because she is a insane talent . Shoots lights out no question, has crazy good court vision , and carried this team to the finals. But I’m thinking of players like Diana Taurasi, Candace Parker, Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus to name a few . These were more complete all around players that could do it all , post up, shoot, dunk (Parker), had the “razzle dazzle” with the handles to cross up defenders and go 1 on 1 and make THRILLING plays that weren’t just the same thing over and over . So I guess I’m saying all this to say, for the respect of the history of the game, I hope ESPN calms down with the narrative that this the best player we’ve ever seen. Because with all due respect , she’s not. I still think she is incredible  , ice cold , exciting to watch, etc etc and deserves the attention and accolades she has received for sure!
I was watching the game with my wife. The people commenting on the game sure noticed how bad the referees were. We couldn’t disagree. It’s a shame to ruin a good game. We turned it off
I thought the Iowa defense would be better tbh
If this is the future of woman’s basketball I’m in all these woman need to be in the WNBA it will definitely build the brand
Ayo them ladies was hoopin! Both teams deserve  a standing ovation. Respect!
all these hoes some buckets fr 😂
Wow these comments are a lot more positive than Twitter love to see it
Once Clark gets more dribble pull ups in her package like dribble moves… it’s a wrap
🔥🔥
best player lost, unfortunate
LSU had 4 ladies scoring 20+ points each which was a big factor as opposed to Iowa where you see Clark just dominating the scoring and nobody else came close. At this high level of play you can't just count on one person to do everything.
They were ballin, wished I would have watched live
Carson did her Motherfuckin thang she didn't miss a Shot in the 1st Half
They played better than the WNBA
NGL, Angel Reese one leg expose thing is pretty hot.
Girl Curry?
Not a fan of either team it was entertaining but officials were trash and that bug eyed Reese wasn’t that good
Caitlin clarck me dejó impresionado hace mucho tiempo no veía un talento así.
Iowa get ya Black players up😅
Everytime it looked like lsu were losing their head , Angel took over. She held the team composure whenever Iowa went on a run. Any big hit Iowa had she stopped the bleeding and get the team back on track
Queens of trash😂
Does anyone really give a f?   Why do the LSU women act like uncaged mon keys!!??
Awesome game. The ladies did amazing, but the show of bad sportsmanship at the end was very childish..
Clark is a sharpshooter give me curry vibes💯💯
First time watching women’s basketball 😅 gotta say I’ve been missing out
Wish this would translate to the WNBA! This was awesome!!
I'm assuming Reese is coming back and LSU has the #1 recruiting class! Could be a dynasty forming!
S/O to both teams! Hands down one of the best female basketball games I have ever seen! And I never watch it 💯💯
Refs sold for iowa.
U GO GIRLS... 😊 LSU! LSU! LSU!
Gee, looking at the thumbnail,  I wonder who won?
This was one of the best female basketball games I’ve ever seen💯
Great job ladies.. great competition and beautiful woman
Clarks game resembles curry’s so much💯
Jasmine Carson averages 8 points a game nd only 1 3 a game nd went off for 22 coming off the bench lol what a night to have the best game of your life.
What a  game
this was a lit game
WHO DAT ⚜️
They were ok 😎
Even in the loss....Clark was still the best player on the court.....congrats LSU...they came to play
Ayo that LSU coach got so much flavor. That outfit is crazy
Why doesn't this kind of enthusiasm and viewership transfer to the  WMBA?
The growth for the women’s game this year has been phenomenal
This felt like an NBA game salute. I’d rather watch this than men’s college basketball games 🎉🎉🔥🔥
Something that gets me is LSU, some how haha, took Iowa's defense against SC personal and proved why they had to be guarded. Lit it up so much in the 1st half, it opened up everything for them.
First time I ever search up women’s basketball champion highlights. I’m very impressed. Wow
Hello, I am a huge fan of LSU and the coach, but the gesture by Reese was very unprofessional. It is good to be gracious to the losing team. Reese comments about her hood attitude when she is an adult now and her disrespect will limit her as far as endorsements. I grew up in the projects , but I left that attitude in the projects. I am gracious person even if they are living a better live than myself. I am dyslexia and about to complete 24 yrs in the military.
Worst officiated game in the history of basketball. Suspiciously bad.
Who wears fake eyelashes and heavy makeup to play basketball????? The LSU classless team does!!!!
Shine  Through Melanation ❤
LSU was like having to guard 3 Clark’s at once wow
Iowa and Caitlyn, hold that L. Them LSU girls BALLED OUT! 💪🏾😤
Hawkeyes are Champs in my book, those Hawkeyes girls can sure ball! Congratulations Hawkeyes on a great season!
Best women’s National Championship game I’ve ever seen. This game was so entertaining!
FIX’D  /  RIGGED
Carson was the MVP. GREAT GAME
Jasmine Carson said I’m the female  Stephen curry and shot one in Clarks face 😂😂 na but Clark a beast though .. Carson needs that NIL deal 🔥🔥⚡️✅
It’s not wizardry, it’s skill!
So happy for and proud of LSU!!!
LSU's size advantages really showed
LSU is incredibly deep, my goodness. A total mismatch at 4 positions, basically the entire game, and Carson shooting the lights out of the arena. Incredible performance.
Stan Folden 13 hours ago Carson SHOWED UP on the biggest stage of her career so far 😎
Great game!
Anybody noticed the refs in that game? I don't watch basketball or anything until it's like now but I thought the refs were definitely favoring LSU, idk just seems to me but hey I'm human and we all make mistakes
Reese another Colby
Clark lady is a beast😮
LSU been on legit no cap
Clark has another year in NCAAW, whereas anyone whose next step is WNBA is as good as forgotten, since relatively few people pay attention to WNBA, despite NBA throwing marketing dollars to try to make us care.
Idk how Clark didn’t win most outstanding player she is amazing.
WORST OFFICIATED TITLE GAME IN HISTORY. OBVIOUSLY RIGGED AND NOT A PEEP FROM ESPN. THIS IS POLITICAL.
Carson vs Clark bringing Magic vs Bird vibes
I didn't watch the game, but one thing that stands out to me in the box score is that Clark only made a single basket inside the arc all game, whereas vs South Carolina she made plenty, driving past her defender. So LSU must either have had a better on-ball defender than SC did, or had better help defense.
LSU was on fire
Ok college girls basketball is better than the wnba the Pace of play makes a big difference these girls are absolutely balling
The white liberal Iowa couldnt win...wouldnt be fair to LSU
Iowa need more perimeter speed to keep up with a team like LSU..
Yo that girl from Iowa Clark is a bucket
Reese best player on the court look how she can facilitate full court and be a stopper its levels ... the coach is smart you let the other teams best player shoot the rhythm out her own team so when its time to step up they cold
This was more a win for BLM as LSU sat out the national anthem and black refs made sure the black team won. So much social engineering. It really wasn't fair that no trans player was on either team. How misgendering and even bigoted can you get?
Caitlin Clark's nickname is Money 💵.
Refs really blew this game. Lsu played lights out but Clark was off the court half the game from Bogus calls.
Watching that just made me cry 4real. Simply magical. Congrats LSU.
Incredible Game from both Teams 🎉❤
❤❤❤❤Love -n- Basketball❤❤❤❤
ESPN thumbnail giving it away.. nice job dumba$$ 😂
Great Game go LSU
Love Caitlin but all black team vs all white team we beat the dog shyt out of them
Carson was on 🔥 🔥 🔥 LSU had team takeover on!!!
This young bloods puting the WNBA at shame 🤣 Especially ex LSU Ben Simmons...he should go back and learn a thing or two 🤣
Geaux tigers
I wish I was at this game!!! Salute
Disgusting the way LSU players, especially Angel taunted Clark after their win, very immature.
Great Game 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Clark is the truth. Congratulations to the ladies
Reese jealous as f*ck of Caitlin, how is that you may ask.  Reese won the championship, Caitlin won the tournament.  All can read between the lines
That first three from clark
🐅 forever
Yeahhhh women’s basketball finally on the rise. Proud of y’all ladies!!!
Feel bad for who’s head hit the ball at the end lmao
First let me say this Caitlin is a 3 point assassin another Stef Curry. But But BLACK POWER BABY😂😂😂😂😂
I had no idea that women could play basketball this good.
Congratulations LSU 💜💛💜💛💜💛🤘🏿
Genetics at its best
Clark though 🔥 🔥🔥
Such an exciting game! Kudos to both teams.
Clark can hoop hoop. Lol she the only one on her team that can hold her head lol
Iowa dont miss a 3
Great game and Congratulations to the LSU women’s basketball team!!!
22 ok Iowa is a str8 bucket☠️
Far better than WNBA basketball game I have ever seen. If women's basketball looks like this moving forward I would be willing to watch more!
I know they lost but I’m just amazed how Caitlin pulls up from anywhere and is a bucket. She’s pullin from 40. That girl is special. Contested.. no space.. off balance.. female Curry
These Lil Hoes can hoop
They can never say they won fair and square without lying about it.  I m their hearts they know the refs screwed the white team with bad rotten calls.  They need to investigate the refs and check bank accounts for gambling tampering. They tipped the game by rotten foul calls and irritating Iowa. They never got to play their best. The refs saw to that. And lsu should have stopped and refused to play until the refs were changed out with new and good and fair referees.  This is a racist hate crime.
I need a Jasmine Carson jersey ASAP!
Straight up Black girls vs. White girls.
Congratulations Lady Tigers, you have made me happy and proud.  You are the better team and it shows inthe results. CONGRATULATIONS!!!💘💖❤💜
Carson's blonde hair? Duh, she went Super Saiyan😮
Clark is special,she will be great in the wnba.
Lsu shot their eyes out.Great game.
Jasmice Carson was cooking...
Im glad lsu one i feel that iowa has a racist undertone to them
This what WNBA games should be like
Great sportsmanship from Reese/LSU! Following a competitor, who has lost, around the court taunting them.
I love Iowa, but we were just outmatched. Clark was the best player out there, but LSU had some insane depth to compensate for the bad officiating. Once Clark got that fourth foul, the game turned into a slaughter.
MANEE LSUUU DEMM GIRLLSSS
Refs gave it to lsu
Let’s go lsu
Clark can SHOOT in the nba. But let’s be real here she ain’t making a roster. She looks good against other women but just enjoy her dominating her sport cause their equivalent would be a middle school boys AAU team 😭
This is the best women's title game I've seen. It was good from start to finish .
The girls are playi by basketball again! This was awesome!
So what’s the disconnect with the wnba because women’s basketball seems popular from aau to high school to college from the outside looking in
Who voted for the MVP, the O.J. jury?
Wow the females have gotten A LOT BETTER at hoopin!
The refs gifted LSU this win
Them girls can shoot 😮
Clark is a GREAT player but at the end I am happy LSU  derailed the hype and got it done
I will never disrespect women’s basketball anymore these ladies made me a believer they are the truth
Yes
Louisiana We Did It💜💛🏆
Congrats LSU! N great year to Iowa
Clark went crazy, i gotta give ha creds maan
Caitlin Clark is the best female basketball player I've seen in a while.
Woman’s March Madness > WNBA whole szn
Why is this way better than any wnba game I ever seen those girls balling
LSU won but I do wish the refs weren't involved as much. Im just saying.smdh
Womens College ball is better than WNBA
That's how you market a women's basketball game, by playing well. Not crying and complaining calling men misogynist like little babies.
Clarke must have bumped into Steph curry in a Dennys and got a transfer of power yea yea ya ha ha :D
Caitlin clark vs Angel reese could be the "Larry Bird vs Magic Johnson" type rivalry that changes the Women's Basketball forever.
No one will remember angel reese in like a week, caitlin clark is the truth
LSU is fictional at this point..Iowa sweating one player..LSU all our players can do all that plus more🤣🤣
WoW! 😮 What a game!
They actually played defense good game
those last 10 days Were amazinng for Women Basketball..a different energy  almost forced you to watch. The performances mixed with the personalities. Social media helped. I had never heard of Caitlin Stephen Curry Clark until last week. Congrats for the show!
The refs were the 6th man for LSU.  Their coach was always on the floor
This game, was, doPe! Eyeont even, watch, women's basketball! They, have, shooters! Learn a little, Pressure defense... Who, knows?!? Iowa, went, hard! LSU... Congratulations! Jasmine Carson(?)... We see, you, baby!✨
Dang Reese spins and is bad with it. Makes me want to watch.
Fwd: Geaux Tigers
Ecxiting than wnba hahahaha
I don't watch Women's Basketball but wooow! This was entertaining. These Women are not just good they are great. Ridiculously gifted. Salute
Both teams did their thang🤝🏾
Carson, Clarke was unbelievable ❤❤❤
Holy 3 ball
If the LSU starters weren’t in foul trouble in the first half, that explosion by Carson would’ve never happened.
Why y’all showing the baskets LSU missed , but didn’t show any missed shots from Iowa? I bet ESPN and Sports Center was soo mad that LSU won. SMH Good win LSU
If the WNBA was this intense I would watch every game
This only has 700k views because Clark they should be praising her.
Looks like a good win for women's ncaa bb
I’m here to tell you right now we only here because Clark.
Congrats lsu them girls can hoop
So I saw the coach throw up the Satan symbol when the girl hit the buzzer beater at halftime and they got the sign in pant as well. I'm really sick of these folks
big difference, one team has to guard a whole team and the other has to guard one player
Clark best female ever. Clark is the best female ever !!
So Iowa was depending on 1 person to carry them lol 😂😂
99% of these girls play better than Ben Simmons.
Women's basketball has taken a giant leap right before our eyes!!!!! These ladies are extremely talented! I really really enjoyed watching this game. The shooting, passing, overall mechanics was phenomenal !!!! Great job both teams and congratulations LSU!!!!!!!!
I love throwing it back in her face. Karma ! 😂
Alexis Morris was unstoppable in this game!!!!!!
We laughed.  We cried.  We shouted.  We jumped up and down.  And FINALLY we CELEBRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I'll always be for the underdogs.  ROOO ROOO!  Louisiana State University HANDLED THEIR BUSINESS on 04/02/2023.   These women were more EXCITING than the professional NBA Mens teams.  Sorry guys, but it's true.  It was like we are ALL there in person.  CONGRATULATIONS, LSU!!!!!!!!!    MAGNIFICIENT JOB!!!!!!!!
Clark too nice
Best basketball GAME I’ve seen in a while. PERIOD! These girls can ball!!!!!!!!
Lus you and this group got me glue to screen all season. Congrats well deserve
Clark is what the wnba needs
Congrats to LSU well deserved win
Some of the worse reffing I’ve seen.  Yes lsu was hot and Iowa was cold but with the poor one sided officiating Iowa didn’t stand a chance.
You said you were the best but you went down like the rest respect there gangster
Clark still the best player on the court
That Clark girl, is unbelievable, definitely the best player in womens basketball !
Congratulations to LSU. The Lady Tigers best game ever.
this was basically a 5 v 1 lmao
Why is the ticker tape running at the bottom of the ESPN 2 under the heading 'The Lead' only mentions Caitlin Clark's points and not Reese's double doubles.?
Carson was on 🔥🔥
Iowa was the true championship team, despite the score. LSU taunted, made "ring" gestures, left their starters in when the game had been decided, etc. But the worst was what happened after the game ended. Iowa's players, shattered as they were, waited patiently for LSU in order to congratulate them. LSU ignored them and continued to celebrate, never shaking hands. After a while, Iowa just went to the locker room. Mulkey was too busy hugging her family and getting interviewed to notice the low-class act by her team. Terrible.
Refs against Iowa literally
Great game
Congratulations to LSU on winning the NCAA women's Championship but i was going for Iowa Caitlin Clark
The no class haunting after the game from LSU girls was so nasty.  No class, ladies. I wouldn't want you on my WNBA team, no matter how good you think you are.
The wnba has a promising future
Iowa had all white girls on the team and look wat happened
Listen, something has changed in womens ball. Coz that Caitlin... She got game
Shout out to the LSU team with a great win over Iowa. Kim Mulkey is one of the very best coaches of all time. Her track record speaks for itself! Her fourth national championship as a head coach!! Remarkable!
They were lit no cap
Jasmine Carson set the tone in the first half and Iowa was never able to recover. Great game.
Them white girls know they wasn’t winning 😂😂😂
I don’t watch women’s basketball, however, based on this game, I’ve just decided that I will definitely be watching the women’s NCAA national championship games going forward. This was a really good game.
I’ve got my popcorn ready, waiting to see how y’all can flip this into a lie so y’all can race bait for the 🥔🧠 morons that believe everything y’all say.
LSU Balled
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Those Iowa white girls didn't stand a chance. this litterally looked like the Tune Squad vs MonStars 😂
Cool to see a lot of dudes watchng.
LSU was draining 3s in the second quarter especially number 2
L S U ❤💪🏾🍾
🔥SKYBOX  SUPERSTARS!!!
caitlin clark's phenomenal..
Congrats to the Ladies of LSU!!
Both teams did an amazing job! Congratulations to LSU 🏆
Congrats LSU TIGERS 🐅🐯
so it was whites vs blacks? what is this, the 60s?
I don't know any of yall personally but I am from Louisiana and I am proud of yall 100%
Incredible game! Womens basketball has an exciting future! Clark is Incredible! Special LSU team. So much second hand joy watching them win! Jasmine Carson eat free in B.R  For life😂❤
54 seconds left. Angel showed her lack of class by taunting Clark
Woo Women Rule .......Let's Go!!! So proud of all The Ladies
The wnba just needs to capture this energy
Better than wnba
Jr high basketball at it finest lol hk jk great game
Clark is great on offense, but the whole team suffers defensively.
LSU are low quality people.  Disney is garbage.
It literally was black vs white 😂. No racial.
Johnson went🍌🍌🍌🍌
BALTIMOREEEEEE
😮‍💨 AHAHAHAHAH!!! GOD handed out a buffet of humble pie. 🤣🤣🤣 LMAO! LSU made sure that L they handed out was decisive. No BS one shot or missed call excuses can be used for shelter from that L. 🙌
SEC too strong. Football and basketball.
Fun game to watch. that girl Angel Reese is fire Jesus :) she destroyed the low post. Carson was awesome, Morris awesome, Clark awesome :) good game for real. good job for women's basketball 🏀 world wide
LSU out balled them Hillbillies.
IOWA is ranked #2 LSU is ranked #9 So, how did a #2 with some of the best talent in the league lose to a #9?  Some might say the refs, well:  37 foul calls, outrageous, but 18 went to LSU and 19 to IOWA. That's 21 vs. 20 free throws, and both made 15.  LSU controlled the ball better with four fewer turnovers. Both teams are even in steals, blocks, and assists, but LSU rebounded better than IOWA due to IOWA's poor 3-point shooting (14-30 and Cait shot 19), and they grabbed more OREBs than IOWA. LSU shot fewer 3-pointers and made a higher percentage. LSU played a more balanced game across their supporting roles, INCLUDING 30 from their bench vs. IOWA's 8. LSU's boxscore, in general, looks healthier.  Caitlin struggled on defense, and due to foul trouble, she fell 3rd on her team with 35 minutes. No steals, no blocks, six turnovers (the game leader), and four fouls. For the season, Caitlin played fewer minutes, scored less, rebounded less, had fewer steals and blocks, and rebounded less than any of her other seasons. Her 3-point percentage went up, but she's 37.6% (339-901) for her career (46th in the league) with 4.5 turnovers per game.  I'm not saying Caitlin is required to be the GOAT, I'm saying she's NOT.  She only leads in assists and 3 points made this year, and her career averages aren't overwhelmingly amazing.  In THIS game, Caitlin also struggled to produce in the mid-range and couldn't penetrate. If it wasn't for free throws, and 3-pointers, you rarely felt Cait's presence because she had none on defense, led the game with the most turnovers, and reached her 8-assist average for the season. Caitlin Clark (your lord and savior) led the court with 30 points in this game but needed 22 attempts which ALSO led both teams.  Caitlin made nine shots, and 8 of her 9 were 3-pointers.  Caitlin shot 8-19 from the 3-point line and 1-3 in front.  Caitlin shot 4-5 (her season average) from the free-throw line. Only 3 of her teammates crossed 10 points.  What more could Caitlin have done? Well, she's a guard, and LSU's guards scored 65 of their 102 points. LSU's guards never struggled, vs. Caitlin and IOWA winning every quarter by an average of 4 points (game-high 12 during the 2nd). Two of LSU's guards got hot, combining for 43 points. So, the easy answer is defense, but the stats don't tell the full story.  Many say that Caitlin looked tired, and judging by her magic running out, they're right. She scored the most points and made the most 3s, but she wasn't the best.  On paper, Angel Reese produced the most balanced performance from either team. She was everywhere, doing everything, including stealing the headline and earning the best photo taunt of the year.
Alexis Morris really a bucket!
Now THIS is the type of women's basketball 🏀 that men can DEFINITELY appreciate during the NBA off-season. Totally electrifying and excited without 1 single dunk. This was my 1st but definitely not my last woman's basketball game
This was beautiful
The black squad beat the white squad.
Carson was Steph
Thank God my sisters won against the white school. God blessed LSU
Three's is the name of the game...congratz to the winner ..
LSU made them yt girls look silly 😂😂😂
Clarks defense isn't that good
Sure made it easier to watch with Bird & Taurasi. I wanted to add this to the below comment, but the EDIT button on YouTube is atrocious.
US women’s BB team gonna be harderto beat in the next few years.
Iowa got they as lit up lol bad
I have to admit, after watching Clark for the 2 Games just prior, i was getting in, to pulling for Iowa. Tough Loss.
Wow Purple team travelled constantly 😮😢
Would it KILL - the NCAA - to put also the Womens Games, ESPECIALLY atleast the TITLE Game, on PRIME TIME! And no, 3pm is not 'good enuf,' especially when that means NOON on the West Coast - that's ridiculous! I won't watch the Mens Final, just because of this!!!
Them white girls tried very hard and if they was playing another group of white girls they definitely would have won they ran up against the wrong sisters and got what they were looking for go ahead LSU we are the dominant of everything that's the reason why other races don't like us the world come from us
The coach is awesom
That  was a good game hands down make me want to watch  Women basketball all the time. 🗣
Iowa never stood a chance after the first quarter, we all could see it
LET'S GO LSU
And of course…..total lack of sportsmanship and class by LSU at the end. At least nobody got punched. This time.
It's sad that these girls feel that they have to wear fake lashes n makeup to play basketball.
Good job
One can win a national championship but one can not win class. Unfortunately it was in full display on this game. The lack of respect was truly unbelievable.
LSU, Kim Mulkey - DREAM TEAM 🙌🙌✨✨😭🙌
Why it seems like it was whites vs blacks 😅😅😅😅 but regardless good game to both teams
Did that dumb s*** announcer really just say Clark had to be careful when defending Angel Reese because she already had one foul!??  🤣 LMAO Midway through the second quarter by the way
im crying watching this 😢
Crazy how white america didn’t even know who Caitlin was until these last couple games she’s always been a cocky player but it’s okay when she did it because she’s competitive but when Angel Reese did it now she’s classless and here come the eye lash comments etc. sorry your great white hope lost Larry Bird couldn’t complete the mission safe to say a lot of people don’t watch woman’s basketball and it shows she got a taste of her own medicine plain and simple that’s why she was so humble in defeat because bandwagon Iowa fans are funny
That was a great game!
Blacks are amazing
LSU Has the great Mookie as coach ❤
Israelite Strong❤
Even in MMA, those fighters, after receiving punches, elbows, knees and leg kicks, they finished the business as gentlemen and ladies, with gallantry.  Those college players are being observed by the pros, and the pros remember…
I like how the highlights included Gabby Marshall from Iowa in the introduction,..  just cuz she's fine as f*** 😮😂
The Blacks against the whites and The Blacks won. 🏆
First time following the women's tournament and I have to say, it's just as interesting. Incredible shooting!
Morris brought  it home
That Carson girl can hoop, goodness!!! She had me jumping up at 2 am 😂😂
LSU played well, but face it the referees were absolutely terrible on both sides. And some of the calls they made in a championship game, unacceptable. Diversity hires for sure.
Those Louisiana women's players and Iowa women's players are both no joke.
Carson’s first half is the true meaning that it takes a TEAM to win great game 🥳
Yo Clark is like that 😂 first women’s NCAA championship I watched and was impressed. LSU have some straight ballers!
Geaux tigers!!!
Why is iowa almost all white girls is there any race war going on?
102 points they ran Iowa off the court
Let’s Geaux Tigers 💜💛NATIONAL CHAMPIONS BABY 💜💛
Love the purity of women's sports
Jasmine Carson was hitting every shot
Reese a beast!!!!This final was so entertaining🙌🏽🏀❤️
I've never watched womans basketball before, but if they use these refs again you're sure making  me never watch it again. Absolutely spoilt by the refs, literally some  of the worst decisions i've ever seen. How do these refs even get their license? Surely you have to do an eye test at the very mininum.
I teared up I’m from Louisiana we understand history
We all need to watch more Women’s sports. Especially  WNBA
This like Magic vs Bird all over !!!
Who won the game? I’m not in the States so I can’t see any scores or the game.
Catlin Clark is like a female curry out there....she's going to put fans in the seats in the wnba
Iowa have no defense 😂
White hope DENIED!😂😂
Clark is a cone 😂 lsu scored on her
Both teams played a great game. Congratulations to LSU! I  wouldn't want to play against any of these women. Extra talented on both teams
Well deserved 👏 LSU shot the lights out of iowa 😅
Clark different
*LSU (the better team) won, great game!* When you pass to only two people all the time and one of them goes 9/22, then you lose. Smh, horrible coaching for Iowa!
This was a great game. Usually don’t watch the women, but love the passion throughout the tourney.
This more entertaining than watching the nba these girls can play ‼️
Might as well color my hair blue and call me a feminist now bc this game was fun to watch
They would destroy womens nba. Like this is actually basketball unlike the wnba
Reese Is good but Clark got game 🎮
Yes .......crushed it🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 go 🐅
LSU really took it to Iowa from the end of the first quarter through the rest of the game and jasmine Carson was the one that really opened up the game in the first half.🏀
Never watched women basketball but I see why both teams where in the finals great game
I've never seen so much POOR SPORTSMANSHIP.. GUESS YOU LEARN THAT FROM THE GETTOE
They gave MVP to the worst player🤣
I cannot believe what I’m watching EA sports might have to make a womens/mens college basketball game that would be dope
What an electrifying game great job lady tigers 💜💛
women’s basketball just made a big leap
This LSU team is legendary I’ve never seen a team so fundamentally sound in all aspects of the game this team is a 🐐 extremely exciting to watch.
Over 100 points in women’s basketball is insane
I was goin for Iowa. I think LSU still would've won but let the girls play it's for the National championship! They called so many fouls that they ended up having to call extra fouls for the mistakes they made from earlier in the game. The refs controlled the game and I feel like it was a bit unfair on both sides.
This year I watched the women’s tournament more than the men’s for the first time in my life. I’m not even really a basketball fan and this was one of the most entertaining storylines in tournament history.
I’m buying stock in IOWA #22 - KILLA!!
Kim brought me here❤
Has anyone questioned Caitlin's gender? "LOSER LOSER LOSER LOSER"....🤣🤣🤣🤣
They will be back. This is good for Caitlin. She will come back better than ever. I think the Universe just wanted to give Caitlin some humble pie and check her hunger. That’s what happens when you’re the best. Just look at Lebron in his first championship series. He literally got swept. The universe did the same thing to him. Humbled him and checked him to see how much he wanted it. Now look at him. Same exact situation applies to Caitlin Clark. 💛🖤💛🖤
Catlin Clark man that girl has range !!
This was a good game 🔥
😢
NUMBER 2! Daaaaaaang homey! SHE SO RAW!
Mainstream quality season of woman’s basketball going out on a limb to say it was better then the men’s.
1st Jayhawks now Hawkeyes too bad the nba hawks suck let's see how the Bengals do now
😢
Carson 🔥🔥
I've never watched women's basketball before... I watch the highlights. Then went back and watch the game. They played with such crispness and chippyness! It seems like they need to transport these two teams DIRECTLY into the WNBA!!!
I'm  an MLB, NFL, NBA fan in that order. NBA may be falling behind here pretty soon
Refs were garbage
🔥🔥🔥🔥🦾
It’s a parade in my city 🎉🎉 By far the best game in a long time.. Good job Girls
This clearly doesnt show the horrible officiating.. Good grief this game was completely ridiculous..
They’re colddd women’s basketball at an all time high
• All the hype for this tourney had me intrigued, and the players delivered an exciting game. I didn't go to either of these schools and I've never watched the women's NCAA tournament before, so I'm coming at this pretty unbiased.   • Those refs were bad, for both teams. Ridiculously bad. Harmful to women's bball bad. They ruined an otherwise great game. Not sure what their problem was with Clark for Iowa.   • Was LSUs coach ever OFF the floor? Seems like she and her disco suit got more camera time than her players.   • LSU needs to name a building after Jasmine Carson. She pretty much won that game for them in the first half. Incredible shooting!  Good job women's basketball, I'll be back! (just get better refs!)
Up and down fast pace game was so fun to watch it made me think this game could've been even better had it not been for all the bogus fouls being called by those idiots dressed in stripes. But LSU was just too good and had too many weapons for Iowa. Yeah Clark still had 30pts but 27 of those were 3pt shots. LSU completely took away her midrange and her drives to the basket. And on defense Clark is terrible, she couldn't stop nobody for LSU. Congrats to the Lady Tigers.......
Both teams played well... I'm a fan now
Congratulations
Iowa has no defense, clark can't do it all
Women’s basketball is gonna be pretty entertaining in the coming years.
Black Girl magic 🎉
I underestimated LSU thinking they were overrated, played a soft schedule and Ange Reese was a fake. Oh I had my reasons after LSU lost to SC in regulars season,  and Tenn in the SEC tournament . Also thought LSU coach was a great campaign prop for the future in another year or so. The future turn out to be now. Great tournament all the way around.
Now this was entertaining frfr
Game was lit
These 2 teams have some unbelievable outside shooters. It seemed as though they were only shooting 3-pointers and hitting all of them! This was a great game! Hats off to both teams. Great win for the Tigers.
Crazy they scored 102 points
Well deserved the whole team stepped up❤ it 🏆🏆🏆
It was a fun fast pacing game. Congrats to LSU. Caitlin is a baller no doubt. But this is a team sport game.  Can’t win it all by yourself. It showed she needs a better cast. When Caitlin was out with foul Trouble, they couldn’t create any play making. No offense at all. It showed. They were playing aggressive on Caitlin making her hard to get that shot up.
LSU was physically superior.
I'm a little confused and maybe someone knows College Women's rules.  So the referee explains the technical foul call.  There was an Iowa delay of game in the first half....and the later she called Caitlin Clark for a technical foul in the 2nd half "because he didn't immediately give the ball to the referees or tried to delay the game."  So the referees explanation was that it was a 'delay of game' technical, but why was it given to Clark?  With giving it to Clark, Clark is assessed a personal foul.  Is that normal??  In women's college basketball, is the 2nd person committing a 'delay of game' also given a personal foul...and the other team awarded 2 shots??
Caitlin Clark breaks NCAA women's single-tournament scoring record
Iowa couldn't stop LSU when it came to the paint work and LSU matched Iowa when it came to the 3s that was Iowa Downfall in this game
Let’s geaux baby! 🐅
I love how every time this clark chick hit a shot they went straight to the reply and not anyone else
Congratulations
Why is women's NCAA basketball more entertaining than the WNBA? They need to do a study and figure that out so the WNBA game can get this popular.
Clark is the lady Steph curry , she’s a dog
LSU plays with so much HEART! I’m not surprised they won. Geaux Tigers! 🎉💛💜
I love Morris game. She had that Mamba mentality.
Angel Reese hella cocky when she’s got a mustache 😂
Clark was pulling that mf tho 😂😂 LSU for the great dub 💯💯
The way the highlights were presented anyone would think that Iowa had won🤔
Iowa's women's basketball team is the only thing exciting about Iowa.
LSU played a good game, but they were definitely poor sports after the game. Wouldn't even go thru the congratulations line after the game. Sad that young people were watching that poor display of sportsmanship.. the cockiness and taunting was way over the top as well.
Worst officiated game I have ever watched!!
Bro that girl on Iowa Steph curry 😂😂😂
CLARK IS SPECIAL THO 🔥🔥🔥
Clerk and Carson meant business but great game for BOTH
They really ballin
It’s a parade inside my city yea 💛💜
Bro, I never watched college women basketball, Kaitlyn, Clark, bro she was playing with Kobe mix with Curry
Waited to see the highlights and this channel shows LSU celebrating. Gave away the ending!🤢
Iowa girls, lsu girls and South Carolina  girls basketball teams I applaud this year!  Girls tournament is way more entertaining and filled with passion to win than the boys tourney… lots of future starts for young lady’s like my daughter to look up to!
Lol sent them bums home
LSU shot the light's out
Awesome Game.
Shame on LSU !! I will no longer watch that racist unsportsmanlike team again.sad 😢😢go Iowa ❤❤
this was entertaining and thats a fact but only because the officials let them play.. boy i can stamp hella violations but ill just leave yall with this 4:33 … 😅
@11:27 Tears of joy
For everyone saying Angel Reese was being unsportsmanlike y'all must not have played sports before because if so you would know that everyone talks smack and taunt, y'all acting like she came for their character. Me personally if you can't handle smack talk then don't play sports 🤷🏿‍♂️. They talk smack in the men's NCAA, NBA, and WNBA so respectfully get over y'all selves and stop being sensitive. Sn. Angel Reese gives the same energy to every team she plays so it's not like she only did it to IOWA
LSU Ice Spice definitely got busy. Told Larry Bird’s daughter, I can shoot 3s too! 💯 😆
First time I've followed the women's basketball tournament since Skylar Diggins was playing
Curry really changed basketball 😂😂
Jasmin carson sonned clark
That clark just seems to shoot 3s and nothing else ..is this what the games gas bexome
GG to LSU. They definitely had a deeper team. No one else over 20 on Iowa is no good. Not much of a team, basically like Curry at Davidson haha.
"She's almost fictional at this point." I like that quote about Caitlin Clark in the first quarter.
They put on a show. Had me glued to the TV
This was basically a home game for the tigers😂, you know how many people from Louisiana live in Dallas??!
Such a good game
Wow, what a great game
I've never watched an NCAA women's basketball ball game . This was an exciting game both teams played. They hearted out , Even though LSU won them, Iowa Girls got serious game much respect to them.  Brooklyn is watching 👀
This game reminded me of the fight between Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns in 1985. 🤣
Man idc what they say negative about angel reese she is a hooper and she is aggressive and vocal everything she needs to build her brand moving forward . Somehow she has “no class” and is “disrespectful” because she mimicked Clark ? Don’t dish it if you can’t take it.
I tuned into watch Caitlin clark... what an amazing talent
Rematch for charity with different refs !  Bad calls =steal
That was some serious domination by LSU and the SEC (again) over a quality Iowa team. It was basically over at halftime with that bonkers 3 by Carson (who hit 5). Better defense, better team offense, and a helluva coach. Congrats to them. And congratulations to Iowa on a remarkable season.
Props to these young women. Great game from both sides. Awesome win for LSU. Jasmine Carson is a killer. Reminds me of Kevin Durant. Slick and a reaper!!!! 👑👑👑👑🇿🇦🤞🏾
Baylor University what happened??? How you let Kim get away?????
aye i woulda dropped 50 on these niggas
this what happens when you have only one person scoring, as opposed to the other team having EVERYONE scoring. Teams matter.
the most talented LSU women's team ever?
Women’s ball has been getting a lot of attention this year. I tuned in to see the hype. Holy smokes is it trash. Get real, people.
Clark a bucket lmao
I knew lsu was gonna win.
Both teams was letting that rock fly!!  But LSU was a little more hungrier. Congratulations LSU. And good game also Iowa
That was the best game I've seen in a long time! Way to go ladies of LSU & Iowa!!
LSU are on steroids.
Iowa City stand up👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 you ladies showed up. Lsu was hungry! Hold your head high ladies, there were no losers in this match-up. Hannibal mo was watching and proud!!!!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Congratulations, I am just glad that no one got punched in the hand shake line
The god awful officiating ruined what was set to be a good game..
It's crazy how much better NCAAW basketball is compared to WNBA
LSU is a complete squad.
LSU's offense had way too much firepower for Iowa to keep up. Both teams showcased a high-octane, high scoring, run-and-gun game; especially from behind the three point arc
Carson & Morris went DUMMY 😮🔥🔥🔥
Next stop wnba lolololol definitely the biggest crown they’ll play in front of now.. wnba averages about 30 people
Iowa ranned out of steam, just had nothing left..after defeating SC
Iowa may have a player but LSU has a TEAM 🔥
Rematch for charity with different refs!
Angel Reese is the truth get that sister a Jordan Brand deal expeditiously!
*Fast pace with lots of 3's. Highly entertaining. Good job ladies.*
LSU players showed no class in winning. They got away with multiple intentional fouls and then taunted the Iowa players.  Two of them behaved like thugs.
She got a curry clip
Both teams went curry mode with them 3s good lord
They actually made women basketball interesting . W
Never seen so many 3 pointers shot and made. Amazing game.
Clark u got served
Total classless player taunting Clarke. Typical black player.
That was dangerous throwing that ball up at the end.
Teams win games, not individuals.
They was shooting day mf Fr tho😂
It’s cool when they do it, it’s a problem she do it
THREEEEEEE!
This was like watching a NBA CHAMPIONSHIP
It’s a Parade Inside My City YEAAAAAA !!!
Karen Bird vs The Bayou Barbie. I also like Caitlin Curry and hope one of those nicknames stick
This was pure enjoyment. The wnba will be so fun to watch when all these girls are in the league. The wnba will get bigger in about 2 years, im calling it now.
In my opinion LSU is full of some cocky players, not to mention Reese should have gotten T-Fouls for Taunting! That T-Foul Clark got was B.S. i think the refs were in on LSU winning.
I see all that Caitlin Clark talk got real quiet 😂 Basketball is a TEAM sport folks...1 vs 5 wont work
Everyone mad Clark lost but lets be real. This LSU team was a TEAM. Well done Kim Mulkey
BRO IT WAS THE KOBES THAT WON THE GAME 😅
They might have won but Clark couldn't be stopped
Glad the refs met their quota.
Jesus loves you-!!
What a match up. The 2 teams were amazing but that is the best game I have seen by LSU. Congrats to LSU but Congrats to Iowa that was an amazing run!
I knew they would win🎉❤
LSU plays bullying basketball fosho. Shark effect lol
Wow really Iowa lost dang what  a run to fail
It’s a parade inside they city yea
Clark can shoot
Wow , great players on both sides. Women’s basketball looking good right now
It’s bigger than black vs white
she steph curry
Joe Burrow lighting the cigar 💨
I really don't like Angel Reese TAUNTS Caitlin Clark, winning arrogant, humiliating, uneducated. So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you
Congratulations to the NCAA and the Officials for giving this Championship to LSU, I hope you made a lot of money on your betting lines !
Millions of people tuned in to see Clark and then ended up seeing lsu. Everybody slept on lsu this year except lsu. They knew what they had and nobody would listen. Now they know.
I really don't like Angel Reese TAUNTS Caitlin Clark, winning arrogant, humiliating, uneducated. So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you
Omg Jasmine
*LSU got a team full of hoopers*  If they were men they would have at least 6 NBA first round draft picks.
Stephs influence is crazy
Angel is a b!+@%,she is whats wrong with all the athletes nowadays, just play the game and shut up.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
caitlin clark, WOW!
good stuff from both teams
Baeeeee reeeseee
Can anyone explain how Mulkey spends more time on the court than any of her players, and hasn’t even been warned (let alone called for a technical)?   Why do the referees favor LSU? Is it romantic, financial, or both?
Black girls Magic💪🏾
I knew LSU would win.
Kaitlyn Clark is deadly
Excellent game. CONGRATS LSU.
LSU Was Hoopin Hoopin 😂😂 22Clarke Is Nice #45 Was Tuff She's A Bucket Very Composed Out There 👌
Excellent
LETS GO REEEESE!! WE ROCKING W/ YOU ! BALTIMORE PRODUCT🧾 AND GREAT WORK TO LSU CONGRATS
its funny how the black LSU players are so jealous of Caitlyn Clark like shes whit and can hoop way better than them, apparently some people think since they’re black they can act like clowns, must be the culture
That Clark girl was balling too just incredible performance
Hats off to the Lady Tigers of LSU. Strong Win.
Aww those petty racist great white hopeless fans can stfu now. Talked a lot of 💩 now you can eat it.
Best women’s game I’ve watched great performance ladies 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The first tournament that was entertaining
Caitlin Clark’s mouth deserve half of the MVP Award, talk trash after you win the championship not during the games.
LSU was phenomenal
The great white hope was the great white nope once again! Hahaha whities!
Caitlin Clark was pretty much Allen Iverson on the 01 Sixers.
Melanin wins again
iwoa did not deserve it.. they were   a  one girl show.    Clearly.  17  point difference?  an also I am glad because the leading scorer by  iwao is  hal f  cking wo  ap.
when did women's college tourney basketball become a cesspool of unsportsmanlike punk behavior?
Worst officiated basketball game I've seen in my 30+ years of watching basketball. Also, a technical being a personal foul is an incredibly stupid rule. That NEEDS to change asap in men and women college basketball.
Better than NBA all star game
Morris's nickname needs to be "Cinderella," with bank shots like that off the glass.
I love the energy of this game, we need more!
The matching green shoes is so tuff 🔥
shoutout BR & LSU we on top!
So Iowa’s strategy of not playing perimeter defense failed miserably in the Championship game. You can’t just ignore a phase of the game and expect to keep winning
Congrats to LSU ! LSU got shooters.  Clark oh my 😮 🏀
🖤❤️💚💛🤷🏿💪🏿
Hmm, since when is this interesting? 🧐
I know everyone came for Clark, but LSU has a ton of hoopers.
The 3 point shooting on both teams were amazing
That was great basketball
They wanted to pump Clark up so bad.😅😅
I’m watching this with knowing 2 players on the court … tuff game doe
LSU gotta call those threes. Off the backboard bounce out and back in. You gotta call those.  Good game. How to keep a lead and close out, LSU.
Mmm layups
Alexis Morris!!! My God did she do work. Especially the 4th qtr where it's needed the most! My opinion the biggest factor. She almost single handedly kept Iowa at bay. Plus LSU killed them on the boards. Ask any coach and they'll tell you, you lose the board game Especially by that much, you lose the game. Those takes by Morris were very impressive. LSUs perimeter D was underrated. Not a lot said about that either.
LSU had 8 players on the court for 40 minutes
Props to the LSU women.
The amount of disrespect towards LSU’s team.. it seemed like all critics were against them. Basketball is a TEAM sport, and while a one man show is amazing, one man can’t be 5!
Let me get this straight.  Clark does the you can't see me Cena wave and is called a competitor.  LSU player does the same wave and is called hood or lacks sportsmanship.  Curios to know how some do not see the hypocrisy.
Dang is it Caitlyn Clarke or Caitlyn Curry 😄 girl can shoot it.
NEED TO WORK ON THERE SPORTSMAN SHIP
Was I the only one who watched the ball at the end of the game to see if it fell on anybody’s head?
🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
This was BASKETBALL
Seen how NCAA officials helped LSU win two games.
Clark is the best college BB player, men or women period!!!
Put that back in that face
This was impressive. Why they shooting the rim off like that.
All know is the black squad won 😂
This game whole tournament definitely brought me back to women's basketball
Women’s basketball is getting 🔥🔥🔥
Women's basketball 😂
epic. congrats.
Fire the game commentators for being so bias to Caitlin
my favs did it🐯💜!
Clark was wettin that ho do fr
2ND 3RD EVEN 4TH. CHANCE POINTS AND REBOUNDS KILLED IOWA & CAITLIN CLARK TODAY. LSU WAS THE GREATER TEAM. PERIOD. I WANTED CAITLIN TO HAVE THIS CHAMPIONSHIP SSOOO BAD WITH ALL THE NCAA HISTORICAL RECORDS SHE BROKE. A HORRIBLE ENDING. TODAY'S LOSS WILL CHANGE HER DESTINY FROM NOW ON. THE SAYING USED TO BE "ALL THE WORLD LOVES A WINNER". TODAY'S PULSE IS "THE WORLD ONLY WANTS/LOVES A WINNER".
At 2:35 she walking Caitlin Big travel -3 the final score
played actual defense than the Nba. lol
Love how let the ugly white girl get away with keep pushing off
Curry in female form 😳
This game was awesome! Congrats LSU💜💛💜💛
the Difference between South Carolina an LSU  ...  South Carolina doesnt have any Shooters who can Hit the 3  an Iowa Exposed South Carolina while LSU  has 3 point  Shooters an Iowa couldnt Stop that -
Congrats to LSU but that tech on CC was ridiculously bad. Was the ref afraid of getting hurt?
Everyone was talking about the refs screwed the game up? LSU blew  them out. I know all the media and college basketball wanted Iowa to win. The Iowa girl is really good but overrated. They’ll be back next year but this year is over.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I knew lsu was gonna win just because lowa only has one threat on the team
Caitlin Clark made 8 of19 / 3 pointers . No team should win by missing so many behind the paint shots even if you have the player of the year in your arsenal . Clarck  should have stuck to her incredible wizardry in the paint . This is called addition by subtraction ( Math 101 ).
Carsonnn
Classless win. Didn't even shake hands with the opposing team.The hate the "bayou Barbie" had for Clark was disgusting.
Sheesh Ms Clark out there looking like Diana 2.0
Better than any WNBA game, this was worth watching.
I’m just glad Iowa lost.
Caitlin Clark cold as dry ice in Alaska
Carson is her man I don't even watch women's but I ain't sleeping on Carson
Better then the men’s college game and that’s facts
Womens ball is solid... Theres still people that dont reallize alot of this talent starts in highschool an even before that
THOSE GIRLS CAN PLAY IN THE NBA. 😲😲
One of the greatest basketball games I’ve ever seen
This is like Lakers and Boston in the 80s, ncaa/ wnba is starting to go global
Lil Wayne gonna FaceTime lsu like a bandwagoner
LSU y’all did that… congratulations on gettin that ring 🙏🏿✊🏿
LSU FOR LIFE💜💛💜💛💜💛💜 CONGRATULATIONS 🎊 👏🏻 💐 🥳
LMAO. Funny how IOWA’s coach keeps calling for a travel but in reality those are great foot work by the LSU players. 😂
Great content! Congratulations Ladies! 🎉
Cry yourselves to sleep white devils!
22 was getting cooked all game
Espn didn't want it to end like it did they didn't cover lsu 3 point like they cover lowa great game lady tigers..
Very entertaining game. LSU was just bigger, stronger faster. More agile, and shop better but hats. Off to both teams. Congratulations Tigers 🍾🏆🐯 S/O to Shreveport 🫡
trashy
LSU Lady Tigers led by Bayou Barbie, congrats. Had my doubts but they pulled through.
Women’s college ball is so fun to watch. If I was them I would stay in college for as long as possible. Cus the wnba is garbage.
LSU vs Iowa is of the best NCAA National Championship basketball games I've ever watched men or women! Way to go ladies!
It disgusts me every time I see this hair coloUr ..... do you know how this orange/blonde tinge happens naturally?  Malnourishment.  But you think it looks cool.
Bye Iowa 👋 😢
Congratulations to both teams.  Fantastic games with awesome performances on both teams. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
There's so much more movement in the women's game then the men's just standing around the three point line
Angel Reese came for violence and it paid off😂😂😂😂
These women will not lay overseas shortly and become the next Britney Griner as we trade her for a war criminal FJB
It's very classy to taunt the losers
White people are despicable
Yes I been following women's LSU Tigers since day-1  of 2022-23 season. All other Bandwagons individuals keep away
Congratulations to both teams on playing an incredible game!
Carson walin lmao
At least most of the girls look like actual females unlike most of those masculine looking women. ESPN really force fed this tournament. I watched about 5 minutes until Clark got that stupid technical then realized Iowa had 3 starters with 4 fouls at the end of the 3rd. That JJ Watt looking girl was tough on the inside and LSU girls celebrated like the ratchets I grew up around.
Clark a shooterr🤣
Clarke is like a female version of Stephen Curry
LSU did that!!!😂❤
espn is the worst at advertising i missed the game
I am an LSU fan and very glad we won. However,  those refs were horrible. They should have let those girls play a little more without touch fouls
Jasmine Carson did her thang… you go girl ✊🏿
🙄 LSU Just had one of those games where they couldn’t miss.  Lucky for them and unlucky for Iowa.  Jasmine Carson had 0 points the last 3 games lol
LSU Women made me cry when i seen the off the glass before halftime. 🐯
Today's basketball is just what team will make most of their 3s is going to probably win
this is amazing for the sport. Sponsorships about to blow up
Did you notice the air being removed from the ball & thrown back to the court?
Was happy for Coach Mulkey, she did a great job turning around the LSU program, maybe though she needs to teach them about showing good sportsmanship.
Jasmine Carson, and Angel Reese got some serious 😎 swag.
Texas Western vs Kentucky  1966 just has the similar feeling
LSU captain of have been more respectful with the win.
Bruh Clark is the best female player I have ever seen
This was a good game, and both teams made it interesting. However, the referees RUINED the game.
Caitlyn playing like a 6’1 sharpshooter on 2k17😭
LSU played great, But Iowa had 2/3 s of their team on the bench or with 4 fouls.. Viewers were robbed of a real game?
i wonder if Clark is actually a guy.  Is it possible that he is hiding his gential ID?
This tournament has made me a women's college basketball fan and I couldn't have cared less 3 weeks ago.  Just.. WOW!
3 refs  not looking at all like America corruptly makes racist Dawn Staley relieved.  Iowa was a victim of racism
Trey game
I new jasmine would be the sleeper cell for LSU props to the coach for putting her in
Terrible female officials
LSU beat America's sweet heart. The better team beat the best player. Iowa was exposed defensively. Giving up 102. 59 in the first half. LSU shot Iowa out of the gym in the 2nd Q and Iowa couldn't rally even when they had a 15-3 run in the 3rd. Angel Reece taunting Clark was fun. Sportsmanship has always been overrated esp in the women's game.
Love them dookie girls. Refs were the best. Mulkey dress da best. Sell dat merch bubbie
this tournament made me want to watch woman sports!!
The reason  Iowa  lost is because  no defense  u can't win by just shooting
LSU OUT RAN IOWA! A running team Iowa wasn’t ready for the speed
Congratulations ladies I knew from the beginning that you were going all the way 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
ClASSless players.  Karma will get you and your trailer trash dressing coach.
Man those refs were terrible
Looked rigged and that's how it will be remembered.
I can’t say this would make me watch the WNBA regularly, but watching performances like Clarke and Carson would definitely get me interested in the WNBA playoffs. Great game by Carson, but unreal shooting from Clarke—quick releases and deep what even…
What a squad! Congratulations ladies!
Awesome game!!!
How many other cliches can you toss in there?
Great game!!!
LSU showed everyone that there's levels to this basketball thing.
Come watch my NORD team play for the championship
Yall can talk about how great these players and teams are,which  I agree, b ut this was the worst referees game ever. The refs ruined this game. Would've liked to see it called fairly. That wouldve been a good game. . Ncaa and those refs absolutely blew it!¡! For every one to see. These no contact fouls and girls.flopping when they didn't get touched.....ruined the game
Shout Out to the sisters at LSU for the win... Caitlin Clark you are a killah!!   "women are amazing"
Iowa did something LSU didn't, beat USC.  Iowa 1 - USC 0 vs  USC 2 - LSU 0. Big advantage was the age and experience of all the LSU transfers.
This young lady Clark is like the Steph Curry of Women basketball Wao!
To watch them score 102 points thats amazing they played like a NBA team well coached and also well managed with personalities
0:51 she really just pulled up wit the Jimmy right in her mouth.
Best womens basketball game ive ever seen
LSU players had terrible attitudes as the game was coming to an end sitting there rubbing it in the face of the other players with their. Fingers across their eyes doing the finger thing. Then they did not shake anyone's hand after the game from the other team which was Iowa.... No class l s u no class.... And their coach is trying to make it all about her all. She said was can you believe I did this after only 2 years? I've only been here for 2 years and this is what we've done. Look how I've done this in 2 years. She said it over and over you guys suck sorry Iowa wish you had won by 50.
5 for 5 from the three-point line is enough to deflate almost any team.
Bmore 💪🏾
This game was by far the most entertaining game I've seen in a long time.
BUT WHO HAS LSU PLAYED???? THEY SAID!! Oh and #1 recruiting class incoming too.
Actually enjoyed this game, watched it from start to finish. WNBA has some studs on the way!
I love LSU
I just watch these to see the other team cry after they lost its the funniest thing ever
Probably the singular worst reffing job I’ve ever seen, but LSU still deserved the win
I’m a shaq oneal fan so I rooted for LSU 🎉
Carson and Clarke are amazing hoopers
I will never forget Caitlin Clark! She is phenomenal!! An incredible player!!
LSU women 2023 dont ever forget that, brought tears to my eyes seeing them sisters when that title like that, very beautiful game. In the name of lil boosie and Louisiana "Larry Bird Come Get Your Daughters"....😅😅😅😅😅😅😢😢
Lol someone said earlier lsu need to be humbled
Congratulations
22 suppose to be playing out of Connecticut and San Diego ain’t no way that girl got a switch on her automatic
Despite LSU winning the title Caitlin Clark should have been tournament MVP this run she had will be remembered for generations even though Iowa lost
CONGRATULATIONS LSU!!!! GREAT GAME TO ALL🎉
#22 for Iowa reminds me of when jj Reddick was at Duke... coming off screens shooting 3s
CLARK NASTY ASF AND Angel always great ❤
Let's go LSU the best players the girls good job girls
Curry effect
Kobe
I came for the Carson highlights!
First woman’s game I watched and I was not disappointed actually for a moment I could’ve sworn they were taking better and smarter shots than the men
I feel like women’s basketball is about to make a huge change now
Take my hat off to both teens Great game 🎯
Carson I’d eat yo ____
These girls....🎉hoop..like frfr
Great game. I loved the trash talking & taunting. C.Clark played good & took taunting & the L under the chin.
If Iowa get their defense up and rebound. They'll be unstoppable. Hit the weights more
Carson really balled out. Man they was on fire
I'll never understand why basketball players launch the ball in the air at the end of the game. That would hurt.
Yall got me krunk
Holy threes 😲
That was special 🎉🎉🎉🎉lsu
That Clark for Iowa is a baller.
Not sure why Reese felt the need to disrespect Clark at the end of the game but maybe I missed some comment or media piece, seems classless otherwise
I've never seen a release like Clark's
Iowa can't defend and that includes Clark
First entertaining women game I’ve seen in my life
Best woman highlights I’ve seen.
Ima LSU fan fr, but Caitlin Clark is soemthing serious! She’s a hooper
NCAA Women’s Basketball is way better than the WNBA. This was entertaining
best game ive seen this year men or women
LSU!!! Natty Champs baby 💍💍💍
Good game!
Ice Spice Pure from the 3
LSU shot Caitlin Jenner’s eyes out of her head lol
Angel reese is wanted by the FIB and The IAA
Great game + very talented players = One heck of a game!
well done LSU. Now that Clark on Iowa is a problem. I like her game
iowa defense seems soft.. lsu just have better team.well  deserved.
Turned it off once the Refs took over. Too bad they didn’t let Clark do her Thang!
Anybody see the pentagram in the paint or am I buggin?
Great Team Players Plus LSU Got Next Season In Tha Bag 🥳 Kim Recruited Class Looking Real Decent Keep Making History  💜💛
came out balling, every girl knows how to drive, pass and shoot! came out and rolled them over GO TIGES
The women's NCAA basketball championship was a good one.
The amount of Iowa’s fans that I saw saying LSU couldn’t compete was crazy 😂 How did they think LSU got here?
Those lady tigers don’t play!!! Geaux tigers
BOOOO LSU's Reese for bad sportsmanship. Earned a few T's but Officials didn't award them
Big game congrats to LSU. Especially  Angel R
Mannn I wanted LSU to win because shorty from my hometown but to see the refs do Iowa like tht was flat out dirty.. the refs took them girls out of the game early ND in crucial moments in the second hlf
This was fire!!! Way more entertainment that NBA Caitlyn might be 1st 2nd pick in the draft
Congratulations 🎊 LSU
Congratulations to LSU shooting inside  and outside...this is how you win the game. 💜💛💜💛
Sheeeeesh she can shoot!
Clark came with it....  but LSU found a way to keep fighting Reese a beast...
Do they give out a MVP trophy of tournament?  It should go to Clarke
Who won? 👁‍🗨
Thought South Carolina would win it all....i love that team and their coach  was crushed when they lost but ...this game was amazing...happy for LSU...props to Iowa. I try to support women's college and professional  ball by watching the games ...so glad they had great ratings! You go ladies!
Amazing
Were there any dunks?
These referees did everything they could to keep Iowa in the game! Congrats LSU
Able to beat Clark's team always good...
I love Kim . Had the hots for her way back to her playing days.
Wow... Congratulations LSU ladies
Never actually watched a full women’s basketball game any finally my state LSU won and I’m happy that they finally won and angel Reese gets her respect
Spectacular! Awesome season ladies 💪🏿
Good job and thank for representing Baltimore Maryland
22 on Iowa she got a dangerous jumpshot this was a good game
SURE IOWA HAS AN OUTSTANDING PLAYER IN CLARK. BUT THEY COULD NOT MATCH LSU TEAM STRENGTH AND OUTSTANDING PERIMETER WHICH THEY POSSESS. PUSHING THE SCORE TO TRIPLE DIGIT IS SOME FEAT. PEOPLE JUST RECOGNIZE INCREDIBLE TEAM TALENT.
NOTABLE SOUTHERN COLLEGE FOOTBALL, MEN'S AND WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL TEAMS WITH A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE THE END OF THE 1998 SEASON.  1998: Tennessee (football) 1999: Florida State (football) 2000: Oklahoma (football) 2001: Duke (men's basketball), Miami (FL) (football) 2003: LSU (football) 2005: Baylor (women's basketball), North Carolina (men's basketball), Texas (football) 2006: Florida (football), Florida (men's basketball) 2007: Florida (men's basketball), LSU (football), Tennessee (women's basketball) 2008: Florida (football), Tennessee (women's basketball) 2009: Alabama (football), North Carolina (men's basketball) 2010: Auburn (football), Duke (men's basketball) 2011: Alabama (football), Texas A&M (women's basketball) 2012: Alabama (football) Baylor (women's basketball), Kentucky (men's basketball) 2013: Florida State (football), Louisville (women's basketball) 2015: Alabama (football), Duke (women's basketball) 2016: Clemson (football) 2017: Alabama (football), North Carolina (men's basketball), South Carolina (women's basketball) 2018: Clemson (football) 2019: Baylor (women's basketball), LSU (football), Virginia (men's basketball) 2020: Alabama (football) 2021: Baylor (men's basketball), Georgia (football) 2022: Georgia (football), South Carolina (women's basketball) 2023: LSU (women's basketball)
More entertaining than any nba game I have seen in a while
Great job Refs for giving LSU the entire game!! Another NCAA Ref W!!!
How bout LSU show some class with a good win. Your post game attitude nullified the win. Great effort IOWA…you ladies are nothing less than professionals.
This LSU team had a "Barbie", "Lex Luther" and a rapper...Gotta love it😂💛💜🥰🏆
Kim Mulkey took over a LSU team that won 9 games and made them a National Champion in 2 seasons. She has to be up there with the best women’s coaches of all time.
Good game Iowa need a bench
Jasmine Carson tho 🤯😮‍💨😮‍💨
These ladies were dropping 3's like nothing! Great game!  Congratulations LSU!
Still proud of the lady Hawkeyes for a great season! You all rock!!💛
22 on iowa a ball hog lol
At least all the Iowa girls can read and write !
Clark  VS LSU,
They let Clark of Iowa be the only threat. While LSU had a better team game. I didnt see that Clark girl making all those trash talk gestures this time. Probably because they never had more than a 3 point lead. While they were behind by at least 10 most of the second half. Great game.
This is BY FAR the greatest women's basketball game that has ever been played. These women are VERY good. This game was incredible.
Big mouthed, hand waving Caitlin Clark got put in her place. Now use that mouth and hands for what a woman is supposed to do with mouth and hands: use the mouth first to ask what kind of sandwich your man would like; secondly, use hands to make said sandwich.🥪. It isn't that difficult ladies.
Got ‘em…there’s only 1 Champ
ANGEL REESE, "BAYOU BARBIE"  HIT CAITLIN CLARK WITH THE  "YOU CAN'T SEE ME" AND "RING FINGER" DISS AT THE BUZZER! 🤔 AWESOME GAME!!!
Wow, Clark is magical. Was basically her vs LSU
Thanks refs for making the game about you
LSU played personal.  Clark was the only thing  Iowa got.  She tried. But LSU took her to the playground for real. All the iso ball and ft jumpers..   if that was not there 3 in her face.  Can't win versus that..  alot physical basketball.
Any Questions 🎉
LSU has some good floppers
Basketball is a HUMMMMMMBLAAAA 😂😂😂
I was very much rooting for Iowa, but LSU was the better team today.  South Carolina was  tall and physical.  LSU not quite as tall and physical as South Carolina, but their overall shooting and scoring depth was much better.  Congratulations to Iowa on an awesome season!  I hope Coach Bluder hits the recruiting and transfer portal HARD, bc this team is good enough to win the championship, Clark just needs a little more help!
LSU was on fire today. It seemed like the refs called a horrible game. I think they made mistakes on both teams.  The game was very physical and I realized again that I love watching women's basketball. Those girls can play!
ice spice was hittin them 3s like crazy
Cut it out that is not they first one do your research
A great game by LSU was tarnished by Angel Reese’s poor sportsmanship after  the the game taunting Clarke.
LSU wanted this win more. look at the small things each possession like who is working for position on the rebound, whos boxing out, whos giving up on there man mid play. Caitlin Clark is a super star but watch her on the defensive end when IOWA's entire offense runs through her.
Carson SHOWED UP on the biggest stage of her career so far 😎
Where is the defense at?
LSUUUUUUU🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🫡Ladies Respect To Both Teams!!!!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Congratulations to Angel Reese and the LSU women's basketball team for outplaying your opponents! 🎉👸🏽🏆🙏🏾❤️🏀
A Reese is my favorite player…what a great win for LSU!
LSU awesome game Kudos congratulations👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍❤❤
Never knew they had a tournament
Yall missed the real highlight: the refs. Bad calls both ways that kept the players from being able to decide the game.
Angel would be so much more dominant if she added a mid-range to her game. And a left hand because it’s clearly a weakness.
I’m so glad LSU won 🥇
Iowa should recruit a few black girls.
At least they can win a championship in some sport even if it is just lady basketball
Okay now ik LSU won but we have to talk about how Caitlyn was shooting that dam ball man. She really can freakin shoot.
Do Iowa got any black girls on they team? Lol
If it’s wasn’t for lsu bench they woulda lost
Great game by a team who played together by a great coach who came back home to lift up a struggling basketball program. Didn't like the bad sportsmanship that Angel Reese showed towards Caitlin Clark at the end of the game.
Yeah. Lilly. You and Kelly have a safe trip to Scotland. Good luck for doctorate.
1 person can't beat 5
Not much D from either team on jumpshots.
Not to take anything away from LSU but the poor refereeing really tainted this game. So frustrating!
These ladies are shooting the rock better than the mens teams
The team with the poorest sportsmanship... LSU
Fcuk LSU
Awesome win for an awesome team 🎉
Great game they shooting like NBA players 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This team just came together this year and won the natty that's crazy they deserved to win
✝️
Lol, who cares??  Any  boys High School team could beat them!
Helluva game even having cliffhanging moments in what ended in a lopsided victory.  They all hopped frfr
Such horrible poor sportsmanship LSPew
Did the woke as a joke NCAA get their agenda winner? I'm guessing, of course.
The game where white people are the minority and get treated as such is sad
I just found where to clear my mind anytime Anthony Davies don’t play well. I come to watch WNBA. AD Shld be Park of this league. Lol
They ran they @$$ out the gym
I'm sorry but the refs took this game over early.  They were awful on both sides.  The T called on Clarke was ridiculous.  I wanted to see the two best teams players play. Not have them set the bench or barely try to defend.   Congrats to LSU but I want to see the game were neither team has foul problems.  Thanks refs for ruining this game. Also, not a fan of Angel acting like a azz to the other team pointing to her fingers for a ring.
Another championship for SEC.  🥱 just too easy
LSU wins first title but let the record reflect that they played with 5 players and 3 refs.   Iowa just had their 5 players.
First of all, we knew that they were going to win. Second, you can’t win a game with one good player… Iowa. This was a blowout from the beginning. How were these teams ranked 2 and 3? Did all the other teams get blown out by these two, and if so, how were they ranked 2 and 3?! Last of all, this, for many college athletes will be the last time they are heard of considering nobody gives a s$$t about the WNBA.
Love this, this was the team to watch and they won it all 🎉🎉🎉👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Is the regulation size ball is smaller than NBA?
Carson's release is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Missing all the Ref highlights or lowlights
That's why they brought in ol' Kimmy m..... Best believe dat-
LOUISIANA ON TOP AGAIN
Geaux Tigers!!! Kim Mulkey is a genius!!!
They don't play real defense just put your hands up see how far that gets you LSU is not South Carolina they can shoot the ball
They deserve it I never seen them play that explosive 😂😂
Lsu gone run it back next year
Lsu got a squad all hoopers
Dr. Dobson
Wow! Blacks Vs Whites what are the odds😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂especially with all the SH** happening across the GLOBAL SPECTRUM......😜💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Congratulations Lady Tigers!!!!!!!!! 🏆🏆🏆🏀🏀🏀🏀
Good job   Lsu tiger  women coach.
Thanks for giving it away in the thumb nail A-().()’s
Only ppl who would have beat LSU was south Carolina
issa parade inside my city yeahhh😂😂😂😂
Hey Iowa...? Sorry but yall need some "flavor" on that team. Once again  proving that without said flavor, you're not going to win a "Natty"! And them "supremacy" takes another blow...lol Congratulations Coach Mulkey, you know what time it is, your young ladies balled out with speed, quickness, and by out thinking the Iowa girls. Better rethink your recruiting targets Iowa...just saying😅
Those ladies been playing ❤
Clark is a great shooter that's all I see
Refs Robbed Iowa
The LSU backups in the second quarter won this game. Iowa didn’t have that depth.
All had was catlin the lsu did really job on forcing her to not get a open shot congratulations to lsu 🎉
They were trying to find any excuse to make LSU the bad guys. This win was for us vs EVERYBODY!
God really blessed these females with the craziest shooting ability 😭Might have to start watching women's basketball more often. Straight hoopers
LSU for Everybody...amazing how many fake Iowa fans bandwagon them just to hate on the beautiful Women of LSU.
Clark is one ugly chick...😂😂😂 But she can shoot💯💯💯
Gg's but Hold tht L beloved 🥱😤
Go tigers congratulations
Clark is a bucket
Looks like the women's game has improved tremendously. Congratulations to both teams.
That girl from Iowa can shoot, but all for nothing
Congrats Lady Tigers!!! ❤️❤️❤️
The woman's basketball is as entertaining as anything I have seen in men's championship games and I have seen many March Madness games over the years at the age of 61.
Carson look like pure luck.
This game was fun to watch, in my humble opinion these college girls are better than the WNBA,  they shoot better they run the fundamentals better play better defense and everything, I pray they can find a way to offer these young ladies enough money to make it worth their while to consider playing in the WNBA. From were I sit the league would improve immediately if many of the young ladies playing in college now sign up to play in the WNBA. If you love basketball as I do you will agree this game was fun and exciting to watch, in my opinion.    🖤👽
🎉🎉🎉congrats 🎉🎉🎉
It's not about how many 3s you shoot and how deep you shoot them from it's about the quality of the shot and LSU shot quality 3s
I quit watching this game after it became apparent the refs had an agenda. Too bad for the athlets involved.
Iowa is only talking about 1 player. When we say GEAUX TIGERS that means the whole team great job girls
Black vs white😈😉😌😏
8:17 👀
❤LSU DID THAT . Team work make the dream work
Tigers roared tonight “
Bully Ball wins again!!!!
I don't watch a lot of women's basketball but I am going to say that that was a terribly officiated game on both parts but, it seemed like every time Iowa started moving on the scoreboard, foul, foul, foul.
This tournament Iv seen the most exciting basketball Iv seen in a long time
👏🏽🎉 congratulations
I'm sorry I missed this game! 😳
LSU had five great dancers and iowa only had one...the other four could dance
LSU is incredibly deep, my goodness. A total mismatch at 4 positions, basically the entire game, *and* Carson shooting the lights out of the arena. Incredible performance.
When I first heard of Clarke ESPN was comparing her to Stephen Curry. I was like no way what. Then I watched her beat South Carolina and now this game. She is definitely has a similar style to Curry and definitely she has the range to shoot the ball. She is the best shooter in a women’s basketball game I have ever seen. Her shooting is definitely similar to most NBA players.
Its CARSON Time😅😅😅
Those Kobe shoes gave them the mamba mentality spirit causing them to win this game those shoes should be banned
Clark is the female steph
Horrible refereeing. Iowa should lodge a complaint with the NCAA
No one cares….
SEC, SEC, SEC, SEC!!!!
Real talk giving up over 100 points in a championship game is crazy
👍🏾👍🏼💜💛💜💛
LSU should be ashamed of the way these sore winners acted today
They loss the game but that Clark girl a beast
Enjoy dinner tonite ref’s, u earned it. 37 freaking fouls? Come on, pitiful officiating.
Playing basketball with cumbrellas on  Classic
Lmao 1 girl made womens college bball popular. 😂
Congratulations to the Iowa girls for hanging in there vs the LSU Trans dudes.
Wow that was a great game congrats to LSU...... South Carolina we got em next year.
And then comes Carson.......
I can see more to come for Kim and LSU. GEAUX TIGERS, and the SEC is the best conference!
Why women's college basketball suddenly become popular
It was like looking at player 1 vs cpu
Caitlin Clark special and I can’t wait to see what she brings her senior year! I need a “from the logo” shirt with her name on it. Get on that Nike!
Becky balled for Iowa. But the Keisha’s brought it home for LSU.
I like how the LSU coach was screaming at the refs the whole game and then starts crying only when she knows they are going to win.  She had to be tired, she was literally on the floor the entire game.
What a fantastic game!
Carson was shooting from the parking lot
Clark is OVERRATED
No, it is entirely classless. It has no part in the game during or after it has ended. Stop playing this down.
Anyone who wasn't paying attention to LSU this year...learned today.
Alexis showed them shes the floor general. Calm and collective.🔥🔥💯
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Was a movie 😂
No class LSU
This was a CRAZY GOOD GAME!!!!!
Dem girls can hoop! Enough said.
Black people not making everything a white vs black issue (CHALLENGE IMPOSSIBLE)     a lot of you exposed yourselves on social media today. yikes, i forget how openly racist black people can be in America. ffs it's exhausting and i am Korean lul
The female commentator was cheerleading for Iowa all game. Super annoying.
Idc what the outcome was Clark is a monster 😳🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
🎉
My hat off to Kim Mulky
Go tigers
Congratulations  to both teams...now that was the best basketball game I saw in a minute on any level  or gender...two teams giving everything simply beautiful .
Lsu had more chemistry
That is WOMEN'S BASKETBALL at it's finest! Being a SC fan I salute them LSU ladies came for the Chip!❤❤❤❤
LSU angel Reese is a beast
There was a Hawkeye fan that told me that LSU couldn’t score enough points to beat the Hawkeyes !! Well is 102 ENOUGH !! I believe 86 would’ve been enough. LSU played Defense all year to put them here but they opened that CAN !  Congratulations LSU Lady Tigers y’all done hung a NATTY BANNER in the P- MAC !! Thank You Coach ! You are the REASON !
Congratulations LSU that’s my state 🎉❤❤❤❤😊
Got some very mad rednecks in the comments.😅🤣🤣
The tall, long eyelashed, gal with the purple stocking on one of her legs wan an obnoxious, arrogant, prikcess. The LSU coach is a narcissist. Other than that I thought all the gals played very well.
I don’t get the 10 inch long lashes
2:00 biggest travel ive ever seen
Iowa didn’t have the talent that LSU had but they didn’t need the refs to ensure that they lost.
Carson came in with some serious ice in her veins that girl is cold 🥶!!!
The Future of women’s basketball look bright
Thank you LSU for proving me right ❤🎉 congratulations 🍾
Arrogance  will catch up to you sooner or later. The point I'm  making is when Clark waved her hand at the freshman guard for Carolina as if she didn't  matter. She got humbled today. A definite attitude adjustment
The ref's took this game from Iowa.... and we all know why
Where are all the Caitlin Clarke nonsense talker?
Angel Reese is fire
Congratulations to flau Jae the daughter of the late rapper camouflage from savannah Georgia not only is she an accomplished rapper like her father but a national champion as well.
My goodness, LSU were draining those three's. Whenever Iowa got a little closer, they'd shoot those three pointers and be up by 10+ points again. Shout out to Iowa's Clark. She's a baller as well.
This is a very entertaining women's basketball game for the NCAA championship surpassing the WNBA, and the NBA you bet that is my assessment and I have been a fan of NCAA women's basketball games in the past and this present. As I look at this championship game, the LSU is more coherent and almost flawless in their offense and defense they played more cohesion as a whole team and they all contributed well which is why the scores are distributed individually. The scores of LSU are not solely coming from Angel Reese, it was Carson who started so hot in the first quarter, and look guys the bench of LSU did good damage to Iowa even the #13 Last-Tear Poa who is seldom used in the previous games contributed a lot in scoring.  LSU really studied well in mismatches of players and watched previous games of Iowa how to win this game. On the other hand, Iowa Hawkeyes no question about that is a high-scoring team but it is only distributed to almost 3 players Clark (30pts), Martin, Marshall, and Czinano due to LSU's stiff and pesky defense the rest are all role players. Three players of LSU Williams, Morris, and Carson have a combined 64 points scoring more than 20 points apiece. LSU had 37 rebounds compared to Iowa's 24. Guys, it is true, and it makes happen that a good defense will translate to a good offense and scores and that is what LSU did to Iowa. I guess they studied well to stifle and limit Clark. But as it is only one will end up a winner and that is LSU, congratulations. Of course Iowa too we have to congratulate for this great game although LSU is the better team tonight Congratulations!
Sorry starters the bench won you that game
This was like wilt chamberlain vs bill Russel’s Celtics.
Lsu showed no sportsmanship or classic at the end ,,,
Most unattractive women on the planet!
Carson MVP great game
Great game,both teams came to play. Clark is the female Larry Bird and LSU just was a lot tougher than Iowa. Congrats to the TIGERS,they just TOOK it from Iowa. Ms. Mulvey is one of the best coaches out there!!
LSU didn't win this game, the officials won it for them. Worst officiated game i have ever seen. LSU was playing really dirty with elbows, grabbing and holding but the refs wouldn't call them for it, but would against Iowa. I feel really sorry for the Iowa girls because they had to play a game that the refs was against them from the beginning.
Clark is like the female version of Curry!
Clark was getting her face shot up 😂😂😂
LSU players have zero class! Who calls out losers on the stage to a team you played on the biggest stage!😢
Maybe next time bring the best refs possible, not just an all female crew so you check off another "first". Yet another example of quality suffering when people try to make a statement.
LSU played a perfect team game!  Late to the party Caitlin Clark fan....hated to see the supersized taunting by Angel Reese at the end.
Reese and Clark are both cold.. their definitely gonna change women’s basketball
Nice game ladies 💙
Basketball it’s not just about shooting 3’s anymore; coaches had figured out how to defend that system of play ; or sometimes they allow to have sharpshooters their points not the rest of the team ; it takes a whole team to beat the adversary; in this case LSU had more size knew how to play down in the post ; rebounded better and the bench was fantastic! Every sport network had Iowa as a winner and the game wasn’t even started ; the coach from LSU had a master plan and executed it to perfection; how the kids reacted at the end was a bit disrespectful but so the Iowa players did it to SC players on the game before!
Big country needed a little soul on their team
👏👏👏👏👏love this I had hoped they'd blow Iowa out and they didn't disappoint congratulations
I didnt have a dog in the fight bit this was a good game ... Carson for  LSU won this game she went crazy with her shootin... Clark was great she tried to bring them back but  wasn't enough
Y’all didn’t peep lsu put up 102 n made most points n history 🔥
I really don't give 2 craps about women's basketball (especially since this is the only game I've ever tuned into watch). lol But this was the single worst officiating I think I've ever witnessed in any sport, ever. haha The refs made sure Iowa was out of this by minute 15.
Caitlyn Clark is the Iowa team😂😂
Thee best game I’ve ever watched in women’s basketball. I’m happy for these young ladies. Just wish we could keep race out of it and let them enjoy sports. It’s sad to read the comments on social media😢🙏🏾🙏🏾
Bruh their shooting form is so bad on g
And even though LSU outplayed Iowa at every turn, the ESPN highlight reel favors Iowa. Geez Louise!!
Go LSU
IM A CLARK FAN 💯🔥🔥🔥🫡🫡
Ben Simmons should be taking notes from these LSU girls 😂
They played better with her on the bench fact
Iowa had to actually play defense this game and couldn't hang.  They got away with playing 5 on 4 against South Carolina.
Stay classy Clark , they hating bc you’re white . The one taunting hair is fake also .
Congrats to the lady tigers. AR fan here.
This was the worst officiated game I have ever seen in collegiate level basketball.  It made me remember why I never watch women’s basketball.
Reese won but 2 yrs in wnba then will play in the uk that's all
The refs for this game were terrible.
The game was really good. But LSU had poor conduct sportsmanship out there making faces toward Clark. Iowa might haven’t won but Clark is the best college ball girl nation wide and that facts
Proud of my LSU tigers
⚜️💜💜⚜️🏆
Clarkson the one
Clearly Iowa didn't plan to have to defend Jasmine and her 21 first half points! That was the X factor and difference, all this hype and hoopla for one player I had a feeling it would bite them in the a** come championship game.
officiating ruined what could have been a better game
Carson went lights out. 🔥🔥💯❤
Congratulations LSU❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
First of all LSU showed a lotta class on the court congratulations on the other hand showed no class after the game! Really shameful on there part!
100x better then the WNBA
Angel probably the best woman college basketball player I’ve ever seen 🔥💯
Refs took the fun out of this game fast !!
My husband said that LSU was glad that Iowa beat USC because they were going to win. He was right!
This game look like a movie could be made out of it 😂😂
Great game LSU
Wokey NCAA got who they wanted to win. Shrug At least it's just women's basketball this time
They were on fire.
This is waaaayyyy better than the wnba
Eat your hearts out you folkkks
black girl magic put some respect on Lsu
This is my first women's basketball I've ever watched after that girl dropped 40 on SC nice game ngl
Any fighting????
Does the LSU coach always wear gawdy outfits? If so then thats her style. Otherwise it was "Hey Look at Me".
Iowa need to get them some sisters.
Caitlin great job... Let's Geaux Tigers
This game put women’s basketball on the map!!!! The young lady from Iowa is a generational talent like Lebron James. I am astonished as how the LSU came in as the underdogs and won!!! No one believed in them or that they were going to win but they beat Iowa at their own game. LSU bench players made the difference!!!!!!!! This was one of the best championships I have watched in professional and college sports!!!!! These girls put on a show!!!! LSU coach helped a team with 9 new players win a championship. That is amazing!!!!! I can’t wait until next year!!! I will be locked in to the women’s basketball college teams next year for sure!!!!
North vs South*
😂 they ran Iowa outta here
That was a great game
LSU coach has a Vegas gig after the game.
Congratulations to the LSU tigers basketball team. Those sisters did they thing.
Iowa and LSU both played a good game.  But the ref's won the game.  LSU might not have needed all the help the ref's gave them, but any help is not suppose to affect the outcome of the game as they did in this one.   The calls were so bias anyone, with an open mind, could see it.  It's sad that the ref's did that.  It would have been a great game, instead of a predetermined one.  I sure hope the ncaa takes a hard look at how the ref's called the game, and how much they ensured the outcome.  Seems Honor and Integrity is not something these ref's understand.  I just hope it wasn't a race thing.
LSU just had too much talent.
A very good game, but the better team won. Iowa just isn't anywhere as good as LSU.
IOWA made me love watching technical BB again...but LSU was the better team, both offense and DEFENSE.
blacks beat the whites all the time.✔✔✔✔✔✔
Great game, to bad LSU big star ruined it at the end with her poor taunting sportsmanship! There are bad losers AN POOR WINNERS!
Great game. I know the score wouldn’t indicate that but it was a good game. Contrast in styles. This is a stepping stone for women’s basketball.
#10
Good to see women basketball get some attention hopefully this can translate over to wnba
Those black girls AKA Queens put the little white girl to bed😂😂😂😂
Number 2 lsu was wild with the team up 2pointer shot and the 3 pointers back to back i dont even watch women ball but gosh lsu has a team good team
WHAT A GAME!
I liked LSU. But I just realized Clark a  BAAAD MUTHA FUCKA!!😂
LSU - As much class as a bagful of smashed a**holes
This felt like a north vs south matchup
why are there pentagrams in front of the freethrow lines?
If you bet on Iowa your an idiot 😂
Carlin has no defense she just stand there with no effort
These gals on LSU were taller, stronger & technically better. IOWA had a great run, but it takes an entire team to take a championship.
Racially motivated😂😂😂😂
This most have been the catalyst that CHANGES the perception of women’s basketball.   We’ll see.
If South Carolina had more shooters, they probably would have beaten Iowa.
CONGRats LSU. KUDOS TO IOWA AND CLARK
Congratulations LSU the better team won.🐅 🐯👌🏽
Straight up r*c*s* officiating and you know it.
Black Excellence at its finest ...Go Tigers 🙌🏾
2nd half refs took over
What Caitlyn through IA has single handedly brought more attention to woman’s bball this year than anything before in my lifetime. Even though they lost I am repping my Hawkeyes black polo to work tomorrow. Go HAwks!!!!!
Carson carries the team…the other black girls aren’t even that good lolzz. Clark is very good though.
Clark is still the best player on the court regardless of who won.
The Future WNBA? 👀
THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE WOMEN NBA CAITLIN CLARK AND THE NEW FACE OF IT!!!
It’s a Battle of The Primates !
One of the best women's basketballs games I've ever watched.
Congratulations 🏆
"You can do anything, but not everything." -
we going back to back the football team winning national championship this coming season
They were shoooooottttiiinnnngggg.
Yo, I just watched highlights and I was blown away! I know watching this live was electrifying, amazing job ladies!
racism if I used Dawn Staley's words....
How much were the Refs paid off by LSU? What an embarrassment of Officiating. 😡
Wow LSU surprised me.. I didn't think they was gonna win at first
Proud of my Tigers, and a great dominant win, but that technical on Clark was complete BS
Yo jasimine Carsonwas cookin, n that no look pass was nasty.  PUT HER IN THE LEAGUE!!
Just realized this was a white vs blacks game...what are the chances Iowa's starting 5 are all white....  I just noticed the entire bench is pretty much white.. They don't recruit black girls or black girls don't want to play there.
Bottom line LSU had a better team...congrats to Iowa, Clark is the truth...but LSU played better today than Iowa.
First time really getting into girls college ball and it was overwhelming how much the refs were against Iowa these last two games and if that’s how bad the officiating is always in girls ball I will quit watching
Gogogo caitlyn clark
Shout to those ladies that really put on a show this year literally the most entertaining year for women’s basketball I’m a big fan of NCAA women’s basketball and congratulations to LSU. For winning the National Championship I love it
Refs sucked for the championship game..
I never knew black people had blonde hair. Oh, I guess that's 'cultural appropriation'.
Angela Davis was killing Iowa with her shooting in the first half.
Sickening game, poorly officiated is an understatement, the worst team was GIVEN the win by the folks in stripes.   P.S. If LSU ever plays again please tell them to tech the coach for constantly walking into the floor too.
Iowa came to win……. LSU came to beat the brakes off any team standing in their way…..
This fast paced game was so fun to watch.
Clark hoopn good game
Worst officiating I've ever seen in any game anywhere.
The Lady Hawks Were Robbed of This NCAA Champions Game By The Refs With Every Bad Call...???
From a 🐊/SEC fan, Congratulations Lady Tigers!
💍
The great WHyte hype 🤣🤣🤣
They made me tune in aint did that since Candace parker played😂
All of them could take Ben Simmons Job today
Clark stephen curry female version
Great game!
These girls can play. That’s all I’m gona say.
Helluva game!!!!!
💜💛💜💛
all black refs and lsu being in the SEC.. the game was over before it started. clark still the best player in the game
In a matchup of two top teams, LSU was the better while Caitlin Clark was the outstanding individual player. No rocket science here, just simple basketball!!!
Refs gave this game to lsu
I’ve watched a lot of bad officiating so only watched a little of this game.   3rd foul on Clark, she didn’t charge, the LSU girl flopped; foul.  LSU girl shot a 3, Iowa girl came close, LSU girl flopped on purpose, no contact, no foul.  Iowa center is knocked out of bound but by the back of an LSU girl (back to back push), LSU ball, no foul.   There were a few more no calls or bad calls, so I quit watching.  Nicely done, no thanks.
Haha Iowa
Flau jae tryna leave it better than she found it
Iowa gott hit with the 3 ball just like they had done to other teams so they couldn't stop it from raining 3's
Carson!!! 🔥 🔥   Clark is just insane in terms of how good she is!!
LSU by far the better TEAM
Like the woke progressives of the NCAA was gonna let 5 white girls from Iowa beat 5 black girls for a National Title. lol Literally like the first 8 fouls were against Iowa, which allowed LSU to get an insurmountable lead. Just more tarnished junk.
Thought Iowa had them shooters.. it was really LSU 🥴 knew they was gon win!
Forgive me for sayin', but it looked like a Black against White Final
LSU used the Voodoo magic for this game. That shooting, especially the first half was insane
CC had to play lsu and the refs no chance
I said it before & said it again the women's NCAA product is better than the WNBA, So much more energy and passion the coaches are better also in college than the pros, it's just better
I don't watch women's basketball but nice highlights this Clark lady kept popping up on my sports news.. people was praising her like she was the greatest thing in womens sports and seems like sports announcers getting sloppy with their bias ways you can hear in their voices the team or people they're routing for this is unprofessional and sad but oh well.
Y’all spoiling the winner make me not wanna watch this bruh
Cocky and shitty LSU players won, disappointing. Clark better than any of them though
Does anyone shoot 2 pointers anymore🤔. Ride or die 3 pointers.😮‍💨 Very good game though!
WE DID IT BABY🎉🎉🎉
Let’s goooo LSU!!
I’ll never forget Jasmine Carson ❤❤❤❤❤
22 was goin crazy
Iowa was so full of themselves since they beat South Carolina , but LSU has better overall players that can shoot the rock
Bayou Barbie and crew n da building 😂🎉😢😮😅
These ladies can play ball..
Ngl the reffing kind of tarnished the finals a bit. Felt like iowa was handicapped with their 3 best players with 4 fouls each before the 4th quarter even began.
I love womens basketball Idk How men don’t respect it this Is Pure basketball 🏀 It’s So Awesome
The refs obviously bet on LSU.
Lsu got a team damm
I think Caitlin Clark is a very good bball player but is cocky. I think LSU sportsmanship sucks. I think angel Reese is cocky and disrespectful and I think the refs sucked and LSU head coach needs a new wardrobe
Yo. This was hands down the best female  basketball game i have ever seen.
wow Kim has really excelled this program at LSU great job Tigers
This was a good game
I’ve never watched a full game of Women’s NCAA game before until the amazing Caitlin Clark won the MVP… But unfortunately Iowa was no match for LSU. They were out huddled by LSU on rebound and second chance layups… And also weak defense rotation by Team Iowa.. too many uncontested shots allowed for LSU… At one point, Iowa was only done by 9 points at 3Q… but they couldn’t catch up….
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The shot making in that game was second to none.  Clarke has a Steph curry shot form, cold. She's going to terrorize the WNBA
Wow! I'm sorry that I missed this game. I had no idea it was going to be this good. I assume some of these young women are going to play in the WNBA. I think their skill level will definitely increase the  WNBA's popularity.
Oops, we dont care
J.Carson !!!! Wow
Litt🔥💪🏾
#2 and #13 held it down first half... congrats LSU!
LSU LOOKED AND ACTED LIKE A BUNCH OF MEN FROM THE GHEETO CONGRATS ON THE WIN BUT IMUS SAID IT BEST YEARS AGO THEM SOME ROUGH WOMEN THEM SOME NAPPY HEADED HOES
Clark & Carson hitting them 3s like Steph 😊
I knew LSU women were something special congratulations
Just want to say Congrats to the LSU TIGERS🎉,but also want to say never seen anything like Caitlin Clark so far as on a female level could put 40 on you any day of the week and give you double figure assist which is unbelievable her 40 point triple double was crazy i never seen a more dominant female basketball player in my life it looks like she will be a legend in the wnba she has the talent to be one of the greatest if not greatest ever in wnba history thats just me tho
#10 of LSU unsportsman like conduct is a disgrace. The coach and #10 should be called out
Alexis morris reminds me of Darius Garland 🔥
THEM  LSU GIRLS BOUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES......SALUTE
Congrats
Lol!!! congratulations LSU!!
Reese and Morris are classless. Evidently they are jealous of C.Clark. Sickening
Too bad the officials were simply horrible.  What should have been a good game was unwatchable.  LSUs coach was literally three feet onto the playing floor the whole game and they give a T to Caitlin Clark for tossing the ball behind her back.  The NCAA should be embarrassed.  They set the game of women's basketball back 20 years with that officiating crew.
Two great teams playing!  I'd like to see a best 2 out of 3 between these two for a  women's basketball scholarship for their school.
It was a story of two different halves. Carson and everyone else that was shooting threes for LSU couldn't miss in the first half. LSU was up by seventeen at the end of the first half. In the second-half both teams scored 43 points exactly.
idc clark is insane… such a fan.
I agree & I officiated women’s basketball 😢
I turned it off at half-time, the OFFICIALS  WERE HORRIBLE.
Ref controversy aside, 2 amazing teams.  So much talent. 🌟 🌟 🌟
Congratulations young lady's hard work paid off!
Congrats to LSU they played great. I think the officials over officiated they should have let the players play a lot more, that technical/4th personal foul call on Clark was ridiculous. One thing I think should be said the Iowa coach Lisa Bluder did a tremendous job coaching her team this year. Yes they had Clark playing all world but even so when you look at their team she got the very most possible out of them. All the other teams had way more athletic ability and overall size than Iowa. Iowa players were taught fundamental skills and Bluder's in game strategy was excellent and every player bought in to the team concept to help them over achieve. Bluder doesn't have the swagger of a Mulkey or a Staley, but she gets my vote for coach of the year. It takes a good coach to recognize she's got a superstar player at the college level and let her totally loose and design the whole team to help her succeed.
I enjoyed this whole tournament.
Iowa lost cause they have a team of cheerleaders in basketball shorts. Only great player is Clarke… everyone else is bleh
😢I cried a little inside when she stooped to that level- wasn’t winning the Championship worth acting like a true Champion? Resist the temptation to taunt - it gives people the wrong impression of your character.
Without Carson LSU lose. Why she got no MVP is beyond me
Iowa got cooked😂😂😂😂😂
Nice.
I predicted lsu to win the chip 💯🐐
Obvious the refs wanted LSU to win.
😂😂😂😂 They should not have been there the lack of calls they got away with last game is criminal should have been LSU VS SC if u wanted a good game(Black refs this game no cheating gotta play like a big girl today)
Hey listen I know LSU won but Katie Clark she is something special from Iowa she going to win a couple of championships in the WNBA
Clark is a ballhog to me. She shoots way too much. Or maybe someone else needs to step up. I maybe wrong.
Wait the media wanted me to know about Caitlin Clark and she was on the LOSING TEAM?! I hope LSU gets their flowers
Ruined by LSU coach Kim Mulkey who spent more time on the court than her own players and certainly more camera time. Shameful and completely distracts from Championship.
Kim Mulkey is hard to take.
I’m never insulting women sports again
I AM A WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL FAN TODAY BECAUSE OF ANGEL REESE.. I NEVER LIKED WOMEN'S SPORTS. SHE MADE ME WATCH THE ENTIRE GAME!!! WOW!! WHAT A GAME. CLARK IS THE FEMALE STEPH CURRY!!!! THE PG FOR LSU IS ALLEN IVERSON. SHEEEEESH.. THESE GIRLS CAN  ALL‼️‼️‼️‼️ ANGEL REESE NEEDS TO GET PAID FOR SAVING THIS SPORT. MOST WATCH WOMEN'S COLLEGE FINAL OF ALLLLLLLLL TIME.
They couldn't pack the paint this game because LSU could make shots
Amazing final to an incredible season for both teams!
This was an amazing Game and Tournament for Women's Basketball
37 fouls and 41 free throws. officials wanting the spotlight?
It was the bench for me
I’m crying my eyes out ! Those girls played their butts off! All of them
National champions baby 😅😊💪
Congrats. Its was a great season n game. Clatk got dame lilard range
Ahh 😢… ESPN’s and the media’s narrative didn’t go as planned. LSU beat their golden girl.
Without Caitlin Clark, Iowa would of got murdered out there!
LOL That was such slight work.😄 The lady tigers showed up and showed out. They weren’t playing with nobody. Much Respect. 💪🏾💜🐯
Congratulations 🎉 LSU 2023 national champions  * Also  IOWA put up fight , " Those women can ball 🏀 " 😱👏🏆💯
9/10 times 85 points will win you the game, LCU just got lucky break
Thank you IOWA for beating South Carolina women's basketball team!!!! The SEC still rules
RIGGEDDDD !!!!!
ESPN who ever edited this video was definitely favoring Iowa clips even though they lost.
I’m trying to find that video where that lady was talking sh*t anout LSU. Can anyone help
Poor officiating. Reese taunted Clark when they were on the free throw line which was fine, but when the game was over she taunted her again. Totally classless. Lost all respect
Great game, pinpoint accuracy and speed,   what a display of three point proficiency 🏅🏅
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉to LSU.....y'all really deserved to win it was y'all's night .....great coaching but even more star power......❤ Enjoy the victory.....but the job is not done repeat next year .....y'all got a outstanding coach
It never fails me big ten always fine way blow it in a title game smhh lol
LSU and Clark Got women’s basketball lit right now congratulations to the tigers
Making Pistol Pete happy in heaven
I called CC a Super Girl. Today I realize that her krytonite is the referees. CC showed lot of class today for not complaining about the referees and not commenting on Angel Reese's hoodrat move following her around with her ghetto gesture that she is getting a ring. In WNBA, CC will have a target on her back because some hoodrats will display racism towards her. If this happens, CC is better playing in Europe.
Impressive play for both teams. I was rooting for Iowa but LSU played well.
At least this won’t show all the fouls 💀
Angel Reese has to be the most cringe B to ever play the game.  It’s soo bad I just feel sorry for her at this point.  It’s like she has a legit social intelligent deficit or something
8:16 🤧
White girl shooting like Steph curry
Congratulations 🎉
Congrats to LSU thank you for taking out Iowa and Miami coming from an Indiana fan. Also Angel Reese is a star
Clark who?
Women's college basketball skills are now very, very good....hopefully at some point in the next couple of decades, women's college basketball officiating shifts out of novice mode....geezus, the refs were f'ing awful.
Great run LSU.  Meaning of Team!!!
The LSU chick with the whole leg tattoo looked ridiculous.
Carson said it. The way thy defended South Carolina and thy guards it was disrespectful to her. And she prove it right.
I just realized her outfit is Joe Exotic boutique!
Horrible officiating! LSU deserves a trophy for flopping!
Total disrespect by LSU! They won, but you still go through the line and shake hands!
Worthless cheaters led by the dirtiest cheater in women's basketball. MAGAT  Mulkey
White vs black
🔥🔥🔥from start to finish from both sides, congratulations to both teams. yall made history 🎉🎉💯💯
LSU
Well deserved, these women looked GREAT!!!  Love💜Live💛
Lsu players are trash. #10 is the biggest peice of trash.....no sportsmanship
Too much sauce by LSU
Congratulations to Lsu you deserve it
LSU s bench won the game, not the refs…
ref ball
Still trying to figure how an SEC team with a 33-2 record was an underdog to a team with six (now seven) loses.
Basketball aside - can we talk about Kim Mulkey's sequined pant suit??? Wth? White woman! White, white, white!   iykyk
Who cares....Sports is dead as far as this household is concerned.
Mulkey running out on the court in her drip is everything
LSU your shooting was great. Officiating seemed on the shady side. Handcuufing a title game is unnecessary. Congratulations. Like I've posted before. My school was knocked out early but u ladies kept me watching.
Other than the poor officiating, this was such an amazing NCAA Women’s Tournament! Can’t wait for next season!
LSU IS A TEAM 😃 IOWA IS a ONE GAL TEAM 🤣
🎉
Great game from both teams. Congratulations to LSU 🐅
As a South Carolina alum, congrats to LSU. I have no issue with the state of Iowa, but their Hawkeye fans for the last 24 hours before the game were pretty arrogant.
First full college game I ever watch.
This game was in the bag for LSU from the start. Kim Mulkey is my 2nd favorite coach. But let her answer this. With 34 seconds left in the game and up by 14 points. Why did she allow her team to shoot a 3? That was the most disrespectful action I have ever seen. Shame on LSU and shame on Kim Mulkey. Quality teams do not do classless acts like that.
great victory ladies
at no point in watching this did i think iowa had ah chance. They just got outplayed bad
Clark is a bad mf
Was really rooting for Caitlin Clark but LSU just looked like they wanted it more in the 3rd and 4th qtr!!! Bullying IOWA with the rebounds
Straight offense, LSU strategy worked.  You can't block them big Amazon women from Iowa. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That was South Carolina flaw.   However, LSU is much quicker with better agility. They owned the paint and was hitting threes.
Iowa really got humbled. South Carolina would have easily beaten LSU.
Don't give away the result with the screenshot of the video...
LSU showed those white women from Iowa what Black Girl magic all about!
The winner.....Women's College Basketball.  Wouldn't be surprised if this game set the ratings record for Women's hoops.
I guess Reese,drawing that ring on her finger wasn’t premature, huh? Lol
I don't like Angel Reese taunting Caitlin Clark, too proud, shaming Caitlin Clark
I had no rooting interest in either team. I watched to see two excellent teams go at it. I rarely criticize officials, but I gotta say, this was PATHETIC! It seemed very obvious the officials wanted to neutralize Caitlyn Clark and give an advantage to LSU. So many of those calls were "touch" fouls. I've seen more contact in a senior citizens shuffleboard contest. The refs should be ashamed of themselves. They became the focal point and clearly were one sided.
Easy work LSU 🔥🔥
Overall, this was a very entertaining tournament. Great finish from LSU. They came out ready to play! Wonderful team effort And kudos to jasmine for coming off the bench & contributing with those huge 3’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man Clarck was on fire
Good to see Catlin Clark humbled, she is very arrogant.
About to start watching women’s basketball more often
$EC money paid off again. Great job refs.
Common angel.....bmore sees u girl
It's amazing how the media can vote a player for a good award but when it comes right down to it like LSU did shut that Clark girl down and how she reacted with foul trouble! Wow! Great game though. Good job LSU! See you next year. Go UConn Huskies!
Angel Reece needs to study less trash talk, and more math/english
iowa was definitely outmatched, outsized... but they played with a lot of heart. carson definitely came out of nowhere to lift the tigers ....... hopefully CC will be back next year.
I don't like Angel Reese taunting Caitlin Clark, too proud, shaming Caitlin Clark
Way to go LSU!!!!! You are some incredible women!!! Congratulations!!! ⭐💕❤️
Watching this is epic
Kim Mulkey is a winning awesome coach
underdogs came to play
caitlin who
I watched the game . Lsu  tigers are good , but not that good to beat the Iowa Hawkeyes when you have terrible referees that might of been paid by Kim mulkeys money . Why didn't the lsu coach get a technical foul every time she was out of the coaches box, and another thing why was all three referees black.  That was kind of odd. I said the NCAA has to make changes when it comes to referees.
*Congratulations to Kim Mulkey and LSU for bringing them their first title in 2 seasons! I bet Dawn is salty and she's gonna find some way to pull the race card.*
LSU came to play baby 🔥🔥
Carson 👍👍👍
So, Catlin only shoots 3s?
The only player i seen this year able to shut down angel reese was that big bih from South Carolina called Big Boston. Respect to this girl OBrady she but she ain’t big enough to stop the bayou barbie
LSU lit them up from outside, good to see a team that can shoot. After watching south carolina throw up bricks I kind of wondered how they were undefeated.
22 is crazy good😃
Baltimore yea shortyyyyyy you did that
Black girls ROCK
Carson showed Iowa.
kim coached that win... tough loss for CC and Iowa and B1G. but we will be back next year.
Way to go Lady Tigers🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What a game
So proud of both Teams ! That was the most intense and phenomenal game I’ve ever seen ! It was like watching Professional Players ❤ OMG ! Everyone is a MVP ! ❤
LSU came to play and they didn’t care about all the hype around Clark
Great job by LSU, but man do they ever call travels in basketball anymore? Very obvious travels by LSU multiple times early in the game that led to points.
Carson u did your thang great game
Carson did that!! Gone girl. What a game.
KARMA‼️🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LSU flopping,locking arms and fouling over the top,and pushing off for rebounds and they got away with it the whole game.Truly pathetic
Great game ...Happy for coach Kim ...what a super job she did with that team . Congrats to Iowa for a great year . Terrible officiating...Unfortunately REESE and her antics at the end of game really didn't need to happen ...disrespectful and unsportsmanlike . Took away from victory ... SHAME ...
SEC SEC SEC.......and all you folks making it out to be more than a basketball game make me sick. All of you race warmongering pieces of fecal that did that mess before the game and on some of the streaming channels. Ok so what of the make up of each team. They both prepared hard and put in long hours, so stop the bullspit.  Now then....... little ten, errrr....big ten fans got your sec big ten title game, eh? Another sec  championship. No excuses.  Jasmine Carson......way to geaux gurl!!! Caitlin, I shan't call you over rated again. You are a wonderful player. Your team had a great season. Please return next season for the sport!!  C'mon sports fans, let us be better than we are.
LSU’s coach was on the court more than her players were 🤣🤣🤣 she shoved a ref too, zero class from that team and coach.
Great game, Geaux Tigers.
Congratulations to all the teams who made the tournament! Special thanks to Iowa’s women hoopers for the frenzy that was!!! to the champions LSU, congratulations, enjoy the moment snd God bless.
Yah!!!!!😝😝😝😝😝
Iowa is one-dimensional with slow players inside. They got destroyed on the offensive boards by the more athletic players. And Carson showed up Clark.
Yes sir
IF NO ONE BELIEVED IN LSU THEY BELIEVED IN THEMSELVES. Great  Game LSU. Records are meant to be broken. Many athletes  have broke records and never won a Championship.
Lol. Fakelin Clark got exposed! I knew Coach Mulkey was gonna bring it home! They’ve been disrespected all season long! Congrats Lady Tigers!!! 🥳🍾👏🎉
What a game.Every basketball fan appreciates when a good match is played and frankly the wnba wouldn't have to worry about equal pay if they played a bit like this.
The best girls basketball game I’ve watched . They were ballin .
🎉💜💛🎉Geaux Tigers 🐅 👍🏿💯 Congratulations on a great season and a great Championship game 🎉. Louisiana Pride!🎉
Referees ruined the game
The amazing first half that Jasmine Carson had put Iowa in a hole they never recovered from. I pretty much knew that LSU would win this game, it follows the course of history. 90 percent of the time whenever the media makes a God/Goddess out of someone (in this case Caitlin Clark), the opposing team wins  and there's a hero who had the game of their life (Jasmine Carson). One reason for this is making a God out of someone makes the other team feel forgotten about and it fuels their fire. It's about matchups. LSU were fortunate to play Iowa in the final instead of SC because they would've lost to them for a second time this season!
SO  glad  LSU sent  those  Iowa  hicks  packing. 2023 only one person  of color  on that  team. Let's  u know  about  racism
To beat them AT HOME is crazy
This is one of the best women's finals I have ever watched.  Caitlin Clark , oh what an exceptional player and some very good unknown nationally team- players in her team.  Great game! Jasmine Carson, Miss Reese  and Alexis Morris and other players, thanks for this exciting and breathtaking final. You deserve to be CHAMPIONS. Congratulations!
Atrocious refereeing
This is always good to see.  Couldn't have ended any better.
Yesssssssss LSU🎉❤
Awesome congrats LSU 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🥇🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇🥇🥇🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇 Championship 🤟🏼💯
Make Louisiana Great Again
There’s a new Sheriff in town!! Her name is Kim Mulkey 💜💛 Geaux TIGERS 🐅 💜💛💜💛 National Champs 🏆
Clark is the female version of Steph curry
LSU's offense was on fire today. Everyone stepped up and it was truly a team win for them. Not gonna lie, I was rooting for Caitlin Clark to cap off her historic run, but LSU was just too good today.
#4 for LSU showed such bad sportsmanship at the end of the game to Caitlin Clark was basically all up in her face making some type of hand gestures.  Just take the W and move on.
Congrats to the refs
LSU vs Clark
Kim Mulky is the real deal. Sis is cold! If we talking about greatest college coaches ever she has to be mentioned. Check LSU’s records over the last 5 years.
Odeon ho
This made me a fan of women basketball ❤
LSU fan here, officiating was horrible for both teams
LSU Stand up!
Iowa's weakness was always their defense and it finally caught up to them. They're capable of beating anyone, as we've seen, but their inability to defend can make them vulnerable. Still a great run.
Congrats LSU.
Wow!
Jasmine Carson was killing everyone on Iowa 🔥🔥🔥
It’s always that one player that comes up big in a playoff series, championship and/or must win game and today it was Carson  Pure water from 👌🏽
ESPN playing Angels finger motion to Clark over and over again. ESPN trying to make her look bad.
LSU really turnt up.
bad refs bad refs bad refs bad refs
Definitely a game for the books!
So boring.
What a game!  Shoutout to both teams. The tournament was great.  These young ladies go on that court and show off their skills, hard work and passion for the game.   Enjoy all the hard work of theirs. The women’s game has always been special and we’re continuing to see how much better it’s getting faster than ever. I love it.  Congrats to LSU.  Total offensive clinic all night long.  Iowa couldn’t figure it out. LSU had shooters all over the court and Iowa couldn’t adjust at all. This was a different beast compared to the SC matchup.
So, when are the men going to be allowed to play?!?!
OMG !  LSU  TIGERS,  YOU JUST MADE HISTORY !  First time in school  history, you just brought  home a Championship ! STOP THE PRESS , THIS IS HUGE, THIS IS AWESOME !  In case some of you haven't  noticed, take notice, Coach Mulkey  IS THE GREATEST  WOMANS  BASKETBALL COACH , Ever ! She is simply Amazing,  everyy she touches turns to Gold ! What Coach Mulkey  just did in 2 years with LSU is absolutely  INCREDIBLE, some teams never win a Championship  and she did this in just 2 years with LSU !  If your not proud of that,  you must blind ! Lady Tigers you are fearless,  when you step on that court, nobody  can beat you !  The Chemistry  on this team, they believed in themselves  and each other ! Every single  Player stepped up to the plate ! Just Awesome !  There is new Sherriff in town and its called LSU Lady Tigers  ! The Beautiful  State of Louisiana,  your team just won you a Championship  and the first in schools history !  WOW !   Nobody can ever take that away !  LSU you just put your names and team and coach in the History books !  Pretty Awesome  I would say !  LSU time to Celebrate  ! The Beautiful  state of Louisiana,  time to Celebrate  ! You should be so proud !
The sisters were balling out! Excellent bball LSU! “She almost fictional”? 😂😂😂😂
Geaux Tigers
Great game!!!
A really beautiful way to show you, this sport of Basketball we all love so much, isn’t a one man/woman show, the focus should be on a collective & a TEAM ! Congrats LSU & Ms. Carson
Been watching the women's tournament for a few years; it gets better and better.
I was so excited to find this highlight segment on Utube.  I have watched the entire schedule of games leading up to the final and was thrilled to see two excellent teams battle it out for the national title.  However,  I was so disgusted that the commentary for the biggest game in women’s basketball was done by Bird and Taurasi.  They spend the entire game reminiscing with former players, etc.  rather than focusing on the two excellent teams on the court.  I had to put the game on mute so I could at least watch the game rather than trying to hear what the on court announcers were saying.  Their constant chit-chat was extremely distracting and had little or no connection to the game on the court.  Thank you for allowing me to voice my dismay.
Angel Reese's classless taunting to Caitlin Clark was duly noted.  But, then, what else can we expect from her kind. Sorry, Bayou Barbie, Caitlin is still the NCAA women's basketball player of the year. I hope Caitlin will return the favor to you when both of you, hopefully, play against each other in WNBA, someday.
I hope to never see a game officiated as poorly as that game was !!!
Jasmine reese is so classy 🤦‍♀️
OMG!! TEARS 😭 OF JOY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Stop making this about black vs white! This game was more than that. These players were competing at the highest level and wanted to prove which team is better. Yes LSU won and they have the right to celebrate. Iowa lost, take it on the chin and plan for next year. Angle Reese isn't classless. She played a hard fought game and when she knew it was over, she let Clark know. Every great athlete has done it. People do it everyday competing in something. Clark is a great player. Alexis said she was in her speech but she also said Respect her, her team and her coach. So this was personal in a way if a player has to tell another player to respect an organization. Congratulations LSU!!!
This was the worst officiated game in the history of basketball. Good game regardless
LSU shot really well, but is officiating in women's basketball always that bad?
Bro I’m not gonna lie this game was lit
So proud of LSU like they’re my cousins 😂
You can clearly see the referees were all in for LSU crocked like all sports Vegas wins big $
this game should have been epic but the refs got in the way
Anyone think Clark will be first pick when she goes to WNBA think her shoe deal will be high in 2 yrs Reese and morrie's will fade in wnba
TERRIBLE officiating.  They let LSU and S Carolina foul with impunity.
They deserve to win with them Grinch Kobe's on and they definitely balled out , never been this excited for a women's college basketball game, they are lit🔥🔥
Great game Carson was killing
I hate to mention the elephant in the room but umm it wasn't even close... An all white starting lineup from Iowa vs an all black starting lineup from Louisiana... I mean really 😎😎😎✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Spécial congrats to the LSU Tigers on a great historic win to claim the 2023 Natty! This was definitely one to watch.
This entire game was the refs versus the refs. Couldn’t even enjoy what couldve been a really close game thanks to the refs killing all potential momentum.
THE NEW FACE OF THE WOMEN NBA :CLARK !!!WHAT AMAZING PLAYER  SHE IS UNIQUE AND HUMBLE BEFORE THE OTHER TEAM MOCKING AT THEM THAT WAS A SMART BEHAVIOR FROM PLAYER CLARK!!!
Women’s college basketball is more exciting then men’s this year! Way to go ladies
We gonna told yawl wuut we gonna diddddd!!! Geaux Tigers!!! Signed; C'Asian!!! 💙
Momma K finna see that big baG - 😎
Carson three pointer at the buzzer
LSU is garbage
Nothing but 3 point shots. How is that exciting?
Poor little Caitlyn Clark lost to a team SC beat 3 times this year 😂😂😂😂😂😂
IT A PARTY IN MY CITY YEAHHH🔥🔥🔥
Rigged for the thugs🙄🙄🙄
Carson went nuuuuts
Hats off to those girls, It is pleasant watch the evolution in the game of women. They are playing basketball better and better
Iowa played no defense
Worse officiating ever
They talking Clark let’s talk Carson today💯
LSU!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
overall great game. iowa relied heavily on caitlin clark to save them. she was basically the only playmaker and only hungry scorer out in iowa vs lsu they had carson and two other players always looking to score every possession.
Bird vs Magic
Amazing tournament. Awesome to see this considering the men’s side has been pretty “meh” all year long. Congrats LSU
I feel like South Carolina were a better matchup for LSU
Congratulations LSU
🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥💜⭐️⭐️
Lsu baby💪🏿
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ LSU Congrats they almost couldn't stop Clark but they did that and more. Well played game 102 to 85. ❤❤❤❤❤❤ THE BOOT YEAH!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Must've said bi$ch a 1000 tines...congratulations lsu...boot up
LET'S FCKN GEAUXXXXXXXX!!!!
I wonder if Kim Mulkey was proud of her team holding up ring fingers in the face of the Iowa players with over a full minute left in the game.  It was a great win for LSU sports, but seriously ... act like you respect the other team and players.  Caitlyn Clark was the class of the field, and is only a sophomore.
Yeeeeeeeeees !!!
Both teams fought hard, CC poured it all but that's the difference between newbie Iowa and veteran Kim Mulkey. She's been there many times, she knows how to win a TITLE...Btw, she cute when she winks her eye.❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍🏆
Go Mulkey Go!
LSU won IOWA was tired all players did well for a big game.
GREAT GAME !!!  POOR REF'S NEXT YEAR PLEASE GET THE BEST REF'S AVAILABLE MEN OR WOMEN !!!!
I was rooting for Iowa, but I must tip my hat to LSU for how their supporting cast to Angel Reese stepped up hugely, especially that bench player who matched Clark's 3 pointers.  Unfortunately for Iowa, their supporting cast to Caitlin Clark couldn't step up to contribute. Clark can only carry the team so much, especially after the physically and mentally draining game against South Carolina.  Iowa's Achilles heel of depending on her too much to score was exposed today.
Thugs
You knew LSU was going to beat Iowa and their one trick pony
“Carson Again!!”
Definitely more entertaining than Today's NBA gameplay!
LSU BEAT THE RECORD FOR MOST POINTS IN A CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
Congratulations to Kim Mulkey. Reese and the rest of the "ladies" have no class. Carson was good. Reese did nothing and Clark dropped 30 in foul trouble. No class LSU and the worst officiating.
A turnaround for the ages? Lmao LSU was always winning this game 😂
Can we get a petition together to make sure these refs never officiate another game ever they need to be fired!!!!!!
Great game!  LSU!!! Clark is a special player!
Congratulations on being handed the game by officials I guess?  Apparently the SC coach complaining made a real impact on the refs.
❤❤💪🏾
Congratulations to our Lady Tigers!!! Year Two of the new coach's tenure -- amazing!
Can someone please explain to me how women's college basketball is so good but the WNBA is so lackluster.
NCAA just killed all of the momentum they had created for Women's bball up til now... pathetic refs
Clark just needs a team where she doesn’t have to drop 30 a game and still lose
This was a good game
LSU had too much firepower.  On a side note, some horrible officiating in the first half.
Before yall say the ReFs won this game. Is was 18-19 in fouls in LSU favor by 1. Not just that, but they gave up 100+ in a women's basketball game. Enough said.
This would be a unforgettable moment in girls NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP HISTORY
LSU congrats, everyone was against you, even the media, the one’s calling the  game, but you pavelled. Congratulations 🎊 🎉
Clark just needs a team where she doesn’t have to drop 30 a game and still lose
Carson has some gorgeous hair.
As an SEC fan I am happy for LSU and I can't stand the big10 but these refs were terrible. Lsu had 8 players on the court. And I think that's some BS.
Disgraceful manipulation of a game fouls on Clark a joke. You can’t push into Clark dribbling and then call foul on her trying to get free. I am happy Monica has her teeth after Reese assault, reviewed and no call. Pathetic. Fouls throughout sorry. A technical, Really.
Officiating should be investigated. I've never watched a women's basketball game but that was the worst refereeing I've ever seen in any sport.
LSU clearly was the best team all year. They played the toughest schedule ( Unlike South Carolina), and deserve this victory
LSU Championship 💜💛🐅🏆
LSU won🏆🏀🎀🎊 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉LSU shook Iowa to the point they were not themselves.
All them need a drug test 😂😂😂😂
This game only showed me whom the racist are...all 3 refs were black and LSU's players that played were all black...all of Iowa's players but 1 were white...the outcome was decided before the toss up. What America just saw was whom is the real racist in America!!!
LSU MVP- REFs.   Ps.  racist classless Angel Reese    millions hate her and LSU for that....
Congratulations LSU women's basketball team! The players all need to go pro!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
My Congratulations 🎊 to the team. Great 👍 job.Thanks for making us proud God bless 🙌 you all ❤️
YESSIR 💜💛💜💛💜💛
LSU just too tall upfront.
What a game!!!! Congrats to LSU Lady Tigers 🐅 👏
The broadcasters were something else especially after the game. You would have thought Iowa won the game the way they continued to talk about the losing team. Clark threw the ball into the stand got a tech. Had it been somebody else they would talk about 'what a bad attitude he/she should no better and should not have done it.
Lower the rim so they can dunk.
How the heck were those white girls able to hang with the superior melanin of LSU?
And I thought that this game turned into a WNBA game. Wow! 102 points for LSU the winning team 👏 😊
Morris is cold!!!!!
Congrats LSU!
Don't let the score fool you.  This was a great game.   Also- Some fools running their mouth about the taunting.     Newsflash- Caitlin Clark taunted the entire tournament.  She got Karma.  Welcome to basketball.
Refs were awful.
LSU
Sorry Great White Hope, ESPN couldn't will you to the championship, better luck next time. Geaux Tigers!!!
Now Mulkey can buy more pathetic clown outfits with her bonus for winning.
You can't let a bench player come in and drop 21 in the first half. Also, LSU has a deeper team, but the officiating was atrocious
Good game fr 🎉😮
I hope the refs were well compensated
Cheating as refs decided how this would play out!  Even when Iowa was gonna get it close the refs made sure it wouldn’t happen!
The refs are the reason Iowa even made it this far, now the Hellenes crying about the refs, just ignore that Clark had 23 turnovers the last 3 games, when she had 17 the last two games and they still won, I didn't hear any complaints about the refs. I didn't hear anything about the officiating in that South Carolina game where Boston was a non factor in the first half because of the refs...with Iowa they made it all about Clark but since LSU won, the coach is getting all the camera time, it's pathetic, like Angel Reese didn't just break the double double record, yea not enough assist to get triple doubles but also not 23 turnovers the last 3 games like the GWH
AMAZING!!!!!
I've never actually sat down to watched basket ball let alone woman's basket ball. I was drawn in by all the hype around Caitlin! I'm a fan now to say the least!
Carson lookin like Robert horry 😂
No class from Lsu! Angel Reece is a poor sportsman! No need for flipping off Caitlin Clark at the end of the game.
Geaux Tigers.  Gotta love you ladies.
Huge Congrats LSU Ladies!!!
Geaux Tigers!!!
Is there a different rule for traveling in womens basketball? Maybe I'm wrong but it seemed like they dont call it often. Regardless happy for my home team LSU 🎉 Both teams put on a show, great job ladies
Sure is a lot of salty white people in the comments! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
White girls vs black Queens born to play probably really all naturally talented no training straight natural ❤🎉🎉bayou hooping
Both teams got some shooters
I already saw the outcome but watching a replay has me on the edge.
Clark can’t do it all, can’t win a championship with 1 player, LSU was more well rounded team and it clearly showed
LSU played amazing so did Iowa , but LSU played some of the best basketball I have seen women or men despite both teams dealing with the refs. Side note I noticed almost all the people in the comments making this a race thing are black but I guess if you identify yourself by color and not personality it makes you feel good but either way great game LSU deserved to win!
Just watched LSU win a National Championship. Reese has no class AT ALL.  The way she waved her hand in the face of Clark was DISGUSTING.  CLARK IS A BETTER PLAYER THAN SHE’ll EVER BE . SO DISRESPECTFUL AND IMMATURE.She reminds me of a young LeBron.
Geaux Tigers 🐅
I was rooting for UCONN all year but congrats to LSU for knocking off Cocky Clark.
nice to see some lower seeds get all the attention this year for both tourneys
Congrats to LSU. Talk about a match up wow. Kudos to IOWA for never giving up.
The refs won again 🎉
Congratulations
Iowa shot better than their SF game, but LSU shot alittle better and 64% from 3. LSU also had 11 more possessions due to +7 off rebs and 4 less TO's
LSU win had a black eye with the classless unsportsmanlike gestures by Reece to Clark at end.   Classless winner and poor character on full display.
Great Tournament, Iowa!!!  You girls came closer to a National Championship than any of our men's teams will EVER make it.
Amazing game. Also what a fight from Iowa. Ultimately LSU didn’t give up and they deserved it
Iowa team were student athletes while LSU were a bunch of ghetto girls
Congrats LSU 🎉
Carson has one of the smoothest looking female jumpers I’ve ever seen ong
Now tell me this wasn't entertaining to watch this whole LSU story is just mind blowing how they made it come together 🎉🎉
THE YB EFFECT 😂❤💚
Caitlin Clark is a legit shooter
This whole woman’s tournament was entertaining asf!! Great championship game!! This is basketball!!
Geaux Tigers!!💜💛🐅
Great game ladies. Congratulations LSU on the win. Great run in the tournament to Iowa. Offense wins games but DEFENSE wins championships. The announcer who was presenting the trophy made one huge mistake. Simone did not build the foundation for LSU women’s basketball SUE GUNTER did. Give that lady her flowers. It trips me out that no one mentions this lady when they talk about the greatest coaches that have coached in women’s basketball. Put some respect on her name. She is the one who fought for the women in that program. Even when they were shafting her with pay. I hope she is smiling and dancing in the afterlife at this accomplishment for the program.
Wut did y'all think LSU had it in the bag
So Clark gets to taunt people all day but when Angel does it its “ghetto” 🤣. I wonder why that is 🧐
i knew LSU was gonna win they havent reached their full potential yet…
lmao why they HOOPIN hoopin 🔥
Bench player played very Well
Repent Israelites all praise to the most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥.  The so called black man, Latino, and Native Americans are the Israelites. Yahawah chosen people.  Deuteronomy 7:6 “For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.”
Don’t put spoilers in the photo plz. Come on espn
Yesssss LSU 💜💛 Amazing Job 🎉🎉🎉💐
Congrats lsu!!
All black team (somehow a blondish one), all black refs and a coach dressed like a $20 pimp.... Go figure the result.
All the announcers have to change their tune. They felt LSU would lose, not so.
Refs were bad both ways. Three female black refs. So much for diversity. I thought diversity was our strength?
Everybody was so focused on Caitlin Clark that they never gave LSU a chance. So happy for these young ladies as most of the country was against them. The Sports networks (ESPN) were so quiet during this game. All they focused on was the milestones CC achieved and not one word about how LSU came to play!  Full disclosure!!! I had SC taking it all!
LSU! LSU! LSU!
Let’s goooo
I wanted LSU to win but that was the worst officiating ever Iowa didn’t deserve those fouls at all..
Gotta make sure the white girls lose in 2023
The refs were lsu,best players lsu girls? U got the win but all hateful little girls!!!
Lsu did awesome props to Iowa to make this far the under dogs
Nice game, we can finally get dinner cooked.
LSU is sooooo solid
Congrats LSU but refs cheated for you.  Iowa had zero chance..
Watching Caitlin Clark in this game and in the tournament in general was very fun to watch. Good game LSU! Way to represent the SEC!
Congratulations! 🎉
C. Clark isn’t clutch.
Iowa just got out hussles and out coached
There are certain people who tried to make this a catholics vs Convicts kinda thing it’s sad it’s come to that but it has. I hope those people are very fuccin humbled now.
Them LSU players were ready to run on that court 11:44 congrats lsu💜💛
Inside the paint is where it's at.
Well deserved, LSU came to play and they dominated, they looked and played like champions! 🎉 congratulations!
LSU thugs
Caitlin Clarke you can't see LSU 😂😂😂😂
So this is the first game I've watched of Clark, all I had to go on was what the media and people in comments sections have said.. Are you people blind, ignorant or just plain delusional???? Clark plays ABSOLUTELY NO DEFENSE and CANNOT create her own shot!! If she cannot do this in College, she will struggle in the pros!! I should have known better, all this talk and look what happened!! She is a spit up shooter and solely depends 9n multiple picks to get room to shoot.. She just cannot create her own room and shot.. This generation of people watching and talking about Basketball is absolutely PATHETIC and genuinely have no idea ANYTHING about Basketball!!! Congrats to LSU!!! Exposed Clark for what she is, the Kyle Corver of women's Basketball!! Tremendous liability on Defense!!
Where was the pretty girl?
She plays like curry no cap 🧢 22
NCAA womens basketball is ALWAYS good!
WHAT THEY GONN SAY NOWWW 🏆 4️⃣
This was too littt😂
LSU deserves it.  Hitting shots left and right.  But I was really rooting for Clark, only reason I've watched any basketball in 10 years.  Back to watching movies again! Thanks C.C.
I wanted lsu vs south carolina but, lets go tigers 🐅 👏🏿 💪🏿 😂
They started the year 23-0 + were never ranked 2nd in the polls. Then committee give them 3 seed after going 28-2. Prove that those doubts was insane. Well earned title, Angel Reese had season just as great as Caitlin Clark but LSU’s team has 6-7 reliable scorers unlike Iowa
That was a good game. I'm afraid the Refs did a F/U job. A lot of no calls. The same shipt that's going on in the Men's game and The NBA game.
Carson really had the game of her life when she needed it most.
What a bittersweet ending for Iowa and Caitlin Clark
Have to admit, I was rooting for the team that was on the court for the anthem.
Way to hoop ladies.......straight ballin
Lady tigers was on fire today
ladies got game. too bad bout the refs.
The no. 2 Lady she is shooter like klay thompson
🎉🎉🎉congrats ladies
Congratulations to both teams, I've been watching the women's game since Cheryl Miller played in the 80s at USC and I'm glad they're finally getting some recognition for being really good basketball players
LSU will never shoot that well again. 75% from 3 in the first half. Refs need to be fired, Horrid calls both ways.
Freaking jasmine carson like seriously she hadn’t scored in three games prior to this and she did that!!!!! Simply amazing game by the tigers.
Number 2 for LSU REALLY BEEN THE SHOOTER SHE JUST HAD A ROUGH RUN THESE LAST OAST GAMES BUT LORD INOWS IM OROUD OF HERE GETTING HER GROOVE BACK PERFECT TIMING ⏱
Thanks for having this posted so quickly after the game!
RAHHHHHHHHH
It was a good game until Carson made that 3-pointer with 6:48 left in the 2nd.  It was all LSU after that; after that the Iowa players panicked and overthought their shots.  Sad
Angel Reese from LSU has no class
They were shooting shooting 🏀 🏀🏀 on both ends!!!  Great basketball!!!
It’s beyond unbelievable that so many have made this game about race….but since y’all seem determined to do so….it’s equally incredible to me that the NCAA thought that those three particular refs were capable of calling it straight up 🤔
Disgrace refs ruined game
Yeah after watching this game I see why it was so much hype
I wish Iowa won the game tho, cuz LSU players are so arrogant and obnoxious!
Angel Reese is a no good thug. Classless end of game antics directed toward Caitlyn Clark.
Caitlin got a technical for breathing
🔥🔥
Glad those beautiful LSU sistas took it.
Geaux Tigers! They need a movie made simply because only one player returned!!! This was storybook! 🐅🏆
Best game in girls national championship history
Wow what a game. It is sad for the season to end for Iowa. But happy for LSU!!!
This was the most entertaining tournament ever!
Clark is good but not good enough
Congrats to LSU. Never watched a full game of women's basketball but it was Clarke who kept me tuned in from the beginning and then Morris started happening. Them girls can hoop.
congrats lsu
that iowa chick can straight ball.
Such a great game!
Omm this shyt bring view we need this and I’ll watch it like nba face shot 3s goIn dumb
This was better then the WNBA don’t @ me
LSU's first national title in school history.
Congrats to LSU and the refs for their championship.
The always rely on clark like he is the only one playing against LSU.
KIM MULKEY Excellent Head Coaching Job For LSU that woman Carson step up big.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
This game was 🔥🔥🔥
What a revolting display of poor sportsmanship … great team … but act like you’ve been there before.
Let’s go Seattle!
Well Iowa got their butts totally kicked.  There’s nothing else to say really
LSU is trashyyyyy
With Aliyah Boston going to the league, Angel Reese’s about to run the SEC. No cap.
I love how the excuses came rolling out immediately because that’s exactly what I expected. Everything is rigged when certain people LOSE! I’m guessing a right wing dominated fan base.
In the end, the black team defeated the white team!!!!!! BLACK POWER!!!!!
Smoking on that non seasoned Iowa pack rn. Think I need some salt tho
Congratulations ladies of LSU🎉
Calling a spade a spade …. This was a great win for these beautiful strong Black women . Iowa got spanked
Jasmine Carson did her thing
LSU had too much sauce. Iowa got lost in the sauce.
Hey Angel you have Zero and I mean Zero class,can you see me,ya everyone saw you act like a complete Zero,and pointing to your finger for your ring,right in front of a player who you couldn't even tie her shoes.Its called win with class not like a s s,Can tell you are clueless when it comes to class, you have none,I will say congrats to Kim Mulky ,she has class
Alexis Morris on both ends in second half is why they champions, she had Clark just throwing up prayers
it's a Parade inside my city yeaaaa💜💜💜
LSU LSU LSU Caitlin Clark who
LSU is ahead of schedule they also have the #1 recruiting class for 2024. These next few years are gonna be epic between LSU and South Carolina.
Congrats LSU 🔥🔥🔥
Iowa too many Whyte girls. Did really expect to beat a bunch of blk Queens. ❤
My God, Iowa’s rebounding is dreadful.
Biggest fan from Africa🎉 Congrats LSU. My heart can now beat normal again ❤
BEST GAME THIS YEAR...BLACKS VS WHITES
I wanted iowa to win but good job LSU
Now here's my question, will this fuel Brian Kelly's goals in year 2 with LSU Football (Playoffs, maybe even National Championship)? Either way congrats to the Women's Basketball team in a magical season they had.
Yesssss 🎉
At least it wasn't South Carolina... TAKE THAT, DAWN STALEY!!
If LSU would've lost, all of the haters in the comment section would be screaming from the rooftops. About how Clark is the 2nd coming of Christ. Iowa was exposed today. The better team won. We all know why the media and so many people got on the Iowa and Clark bandwagon. LSU drowned Clark and Iowa in the Bayou and it was glorious to watch.
Excellent Head Coaching Job By LSU and Carson was Beast off the bench all of LSU bench players were outstanding.
Man say these women stepped it up this year!!! I literally been on the edge of my seat.
What a rigged game. It's too bad that this will only be remembered by a stacked officiating crew
This tournament did a lot for women’s basketball. Happy for both teams and excited for the future
geaux tigers!
Like my ex-wife told me, LOSERS always got an excuse. I never got over her calling me a Winner. Reading the complains, tells you who the LOSERS are.
Impressive
Great job LSU!!! 👏🏽
what names is the Iowa coach going to call the LSU players?
Classless champs🤑🤬
This better then the WNBA honestly
I wanted Clark to win so bad. Congrats LSU women.....
Clarke's 5 minutes of fame are up! Looks like she came up against some REAL black women this time around! 😂
Underdogs on top💪
Yes thank you LSU for winning, CC over there looking real humble 😂
Flaujae
Congfats LSU Ladies
Congrats to both teams
THE NEW NBA WOMEN FACE AND THE MOST WONDERFUL PLAYER OF THE WOMEN OF NBA!!!
I wonder if throwing the ball out of bounds was a thug move. 🤔
This was a great game ❤ shoutout to both teams  💪🏾 we up 💪🏾
Vanilla couldn't handle all that Chocolate!!.😜💯🤣🤣✊🏾
Caitlin🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
When was this game
LSU players were classless after the game towards Clark. Why does this have to be for the culture for LSU? What if Iowa said beating South Carolina was for the culture? Iowa would be considered racists with an uproar. I’ll tell you this no one cares about women’s basketball until Clark put women’s basketball on the map. Clark will be remembered in the history books for women’s college basketball.
The better team won, plain and simple.
Caitlin Who?
Reese she's kinda sexy
It’s women’s basketball, no one gives a flying f***.  At least with track and tennis and gymnastics the women are sometimes sexy.
That’s what happens when you don’t have black women on your team Iowa. Those sistas had to let you know what’s up. Yeah I said it.
Congrats LSU from a Gamecock fan. Thank you for serving Iowa karma.
LSU had to beat the refs and Iowa, good game girls!!!!
Yesss LSU black power too many folks was on Clark bandwagon
I'm just happy they beat the brick off of Iowa. South Carolina should have done it, but an SEC school did it. So go home, Iowa, and stay in your caves.
I told everybody lsu would win this year evreyone doubted lsu
Wack!!
Lmbo Angel Reese did the John Cena you can't see me right in Caitlyn Clarke's face 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
where them bleacherreport haters? 👀
Worse officiated game ever.  Don't get me wrong, LSU deserved to win.  LSU played a great game.  Any time a college team can score 102 points in regulation, that means you did a lot of things right.  But the officiating was still horrible.
What happened to all that Clarke this and that 😂
so fast
Horrible refs. LSU players have no class at all. They was so pressed about Caitlin they not even celebrating the W they just mocking Clarke.
Jack in the Box burger, rings and milkshake for for dinner today
What... A .... YEAR geaux tigers 🐯🟣🟡
Iowa fans should stop complaining about the refs and be glad that this weak team even got as far as it did. South Carolina, Stanford, Indiana, LSU, and UConn all had better odds than Iowa. This weak Iowa team lost to Kansas State and Illinois. Let that sink in. Caitlyn Clark has a serious ego, and I'm glad that Iowa's relative lack of athleticism was exposed today.  Congrats to the rightful 2023 National Champion LSU Lady Tigers! Another title for the legendary Kim Mulkey... starting to approach Pat Summit and Geno Auriemma
Great game from LSU but the refs definitely killed the vibe of the game 🤦🏾‍♂️
caitlin Clark doesn’t need a trophy she did something that no other women couldn’t do.Shes the reason why everyone cared about women basketball especially men
I checked Webster's, there is still no I in team..looking at you Clark 😮😂
Knowing this games is getting the most tv views than any nba game today why is it only in 360 P disrespectful
Lopsided refs
Great job ladies, the men were trash this year 😂
I’ve never watched women’s ball before, but this was an entertaining tournament.
Jasmine Carson set the tone going 5-5 from 3 in the first half. LSU came to play.
Perhaps the worst officiated game in history.
Congratulations to Kim Mulkey,Angel Reese and LSU a well deserved national championship amazing shooting performance and great game overall 💯
