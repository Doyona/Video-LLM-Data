This is the 1st video I watched in 2020
The worst injury I ever had was when I was in school singing I was on a scooter, but then all of a sudden I fell off the scooter causing the scooter to kick head. The pain hurt so bad in my belly that it was hard to even scream or even breathe for the next like three weeks I could just not run without feeling the horrible pain, but I do admit your injuries are way worse than my injury
He killed somebody in his butt

Hi guys
The funny bone isn’t actually a bone it’s a nerve
Once I was at the beach and you know that feeling where you break a rock and it perfectly breaks, I threw one (I’m not joking, it was the size of a… a… idk it was just very big) at an embedded rock in the ground and it bounced off, and hit my shin, which broke the rock and somehow not my foot…😅
My worst and most tragic pain was at the age of 5-6.  I was jumping on my bed and after 3 minutes i slipped and fell head first on a literal PLATE that was forgotten to be put back. It shattered and then one of the shards penetrated the top of my eyebrow, it was GUSHING BLOOD EVERYWHERE. My mom rushed me to the hospital and had to stay there for 2 hours. Now i have a permanent scar across my eyebrow, luckily it didnt stab my eye because if it did, IMAGINE LIVING YOUR WHOLE LIFE WITH A STABBED EYE.
Mas mesmo assim a gente morreria do mesmo jeito por causa que nossos órgãos cairiam por causa que não tem coisa pra segurar logo todos podem cair e a gente vai morrer o candel
I got hurt when I was on my scooter and I scootering down a driveway and I crashed into the road  And my knee went in to the road and my elbow 🙃....
No puedo creer que esto se haya hecho justo después del COVID (2021).

I recently hit my funny bone on a tire swings chain. It was my left elbow and it felt like I got electrocuted. I have electrocuted myself when I was 4 or 5 or maybe 3 because out kitchen was getting renovated and I touched an outlet with no cover. I fall and scrape my knee at least once. It’s annual and happened 3 years in a row. I have never broken or sprained or dislocated one bone.

Anyone in 2025? 👇
0:39 mess wit da ‘Ham, you get da SLAM
I’ve never gotten hurt really bad- STORY TIME:  So when I was 8 or 9 I was coming inside to get something, but my adhd self didn’t check if my finger was in between the door and the wall, fun fact about that door at the time was hard to close so I have to slam it shut (trust me the door being hard to close is important), so I went to shut the door (and by that I mean slam it) I didn’t realize that my finger got slammed in the door, but the kitchen lights were off and I didn’t feel anything, but I felt a little pain and I looked at my finger and when I looked at my finger I saw something dark dripping down my finger so I went to the bathroom for better lights and I saw that my finger had been slammed in the door and bl00d was dripping down my finger and some how got on a finger on my other hand, but I’m going to dumb it down: my finger got slammed in a door, it bruised up, I had to wear a big thick bandage around it, and I couldn’t open doors or type or write properly for about a month or two. Here is a life lesson: always check if your finger or hand is going to get slammed in a door before you open a door
How big is your brain and how strong are you?😶
BRO THE FIRST STORY WAS SO SIMILAR I HIT MY HEAD ON A FAN THAT WAS GOING SO FAST AND I GOT A SCAR IT BLED A LOT AND I ALSO BROKE THE FAN

4:11 this kinda happened to me when I was 3. STORY TIME yay. When I was 3 I was jumping on my parents bed and I don’t know what happened next but I think I tripped and near my eyebrow BOOM it busted open. My parents rushed me to the hospital to get it fixed and clean the blood. They stitched it up and then I was ok. To this day I have that scar
Do you ever get a break in that house, with all that screaming from arguments as well as mortal agony?

3:49 that happend to me that’s why my head is a sphere and not a oval
I’ve been hurt a lot, but here’s some of my worst ones  1. I was in a supermarket, I fell out the child seat in the shopping cart, and got a mild concussion, my mother didn’t sleep for 3 days straight, due to stress  2. I was running around, I slipped, and hit my head on a wooden corner of an armchair, and today, I have a scar on my forehead  3. My brother and I were jumping on my parents’ bed, I fell, and bit my lip open. And that was the only time I ever got stitches.
2:08 Im losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most gratefull if you my caretaker guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so i can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it to the loss of blood IS FIRE🔥🔥🔥

At 3:53 I remember a similar thing that happened to me  When I was at my friend’s house me, my sister, one of my other friends, and my friend were chilling in his his. He had a punching bag and we took turns punching it. When it was my turn my other friend was holding it. And when I went to punch it my other friend holding it MOVED IT OUT OF THE WAY AND I PUNCHED A WOODEN WALL. Surprisingly I didn’t break any bones and all that happened was it stung.
2:09 I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that i can continue this mortal journey, rather then ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood.
Looking back at this video, I feel like this entire comment section is just with something along the lines of: “The gyatt Slap was great” 0:40

And also one time that happened to me and I still have a scar on my head and have 59 stitches. And stuff.
If you have made videos about Brody and Braden, then you should upload them more and you should make them so they're more animated and stuff.

Storytime: One day i was in stress cuz i brougth someone's school hoodie,and i when i was sleeping i scratched my heel,and the next day,i was on the couch and a piece of my sock,ATTACHED TO THE WOUND
One time as a baby(I was like 1)my parents brought me to the hospital because of a lump on my ear,the doctors did an x-ray and found out I somehow dislocated my hip.Luckily at the age of 9, I no longer had to go to the hospital,so that was a relief
Booooom 2:41
When I was 8 when we’re going shopping for barbecue when we’re getting out the car then suddenly I put my hands on the car door and someone slam the car door and smash my hand but I am still okay
His fight scenes are amazing
I broke my ankle
Ello
1:57 same thing happened to me, and I was 4 at the time 😭
Bryson: I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so I can continue this Journey rather than ending it maturely due to the loss of blood.  Brysons mom: ok👍

When I was younger, I was skating with my girls group and I slipped. I fell down and that’s naturally where my memory stopped when my knee hit the ice. I don’t think my knee really healed from it. I get knee hurts from seeing people skating and I just ignore it.

Are you sure you actually fell off a mountain?
The fact that the only word in the title is pain and in french pain is bread.  So this video is really just named bread
One time I was three and I thought it would be wise to skip down brick stairs and I tripped and fell down all four and now I have a permanent browse. Another time I was riding on my scooter with my neighbors and Usually I would go on my other neighbors driveways but there's one driveway that goes uneven and so I launched forward and I scraped my ankle...and it blessed like never before and its still here!!!!!!!!

Do I got a story for. Since I live in a ranch, you get hurt, pretty much every day. I was trying to get my pea brain puppy to not eat the older dog’s food, I was chasing him away until he went under a horse trailer, I was trying to kick rocks under there to get him out which ended in disaster. I hit my shin on a corner and made a deep gash which would not stop bleeding out and instantly thought this is how a bullet feels.
Mine is 💀 1:20

My pain is actually of getting Charly horses on my right leg, being attacked by my French bulldogs, and even of having my foot stubbed by hitting stuff and sorts of more! Including of getting an infection on my foot which was very serious...

I once was swinging on these bars in our old house. i swung on them a lot, but this one time made me never swing on them again... I accidentally let go of both bars and fell on my back. It tingled, so naturally i thought i was gonna be paralyzed forever or have a concussion, but the real injury was in the back of my head, it was split open and bleeding. Surprisingly i didnt scream, the tingling stopped it. Anyways it healed quite well (despite me not wanting to get stitches because i was panicking about the pain of the stitches themselves) I havent gotten any worse injury since.

Wow!  Bryson I can't believe you have never broke a bone!!! I broke my bone when I was 3\4! I broke my right leg! So I got an early birthday present and it was my first ever device! But now I'm commenting this on my new tablet.... I had 3 or 4 cracks in my old tablet and now I can only play Games on roblox that does not crash the game. So I got my new one on my seventh birthday and I was so happy! And still no cracks in it! And I got my old tablet cracked at least 4 times cuz I got it when I was 3\4 so I was very very clumsy! So I cracked it my first time when I was 4 and I got a bunch more cracks!!!
I’ve never broken a bone I’ve still sprain my hand

fun fact:the funny bone isn't a bone it's actually a nerve
I've never broken a bone either (Thankfully), but I've definitely felt all kinds of physical pain. (Let's just say I'm the female human equivalent to Goofy)  The worse I can think of is when I accidentally hit my head on the sharp corner of a cabinet, and was left with a knot on my head.  I'm ok now though. 😊

I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely to the loss of blood. 2:10

Anyone in 2024
Do you draw your videos
i broke a minor bone it did not hurt that much
It's gta5
why your killing peple?
Pain & I are best friends. I've never broken a bone either, but I have also go through various forms of mega pain. I one time fell off a teeter totter after going too Cowboy crazy on it & I landed/sprained by tailbone for at least 7 hours. When I was young, I put my fingers in the way of the window while it was rolling up & it permanently squished my middle finger into an long oval shape. One time, during Middle School, the 2 student cafeteria workers thought it would be fun to race tossing out the trash. While doing so, they accidentally locked the doors behind them & neither of them wanted to left go of their push carts that they used to take out the pizza boxes. Now in my Middle School's cafeteria, the doors to the dumpster is also the door to another parking lot so it's an openable door for anyone who isn't just staff. Being a nice guy, I hard them knocking & I opened the door & tries to move out of their way before they barreled on through. Unfortunately, they went into Nascar mode & speed into the cafeteria at Mock 300 which gave me little to no time to react & they both ran over all 10 of my toes. They ran over my toes so hard that it activated a dormant gene in my body for ingrown toenails at an early age. I had to ice my toes the whole day &, many months later, had to get most of my toenails removed so I wouldn't get an infection from them later in life. And those, were just 3 examples of some of the crazy times I have gotten hurt. Just 3!

My own pain story: At the peach festival there was this huge water slide it was so fun! I went down so many times but the last time I went down my little toe bent all the way to the side when it hit the wall of that little pool at the bottom my parents brought me home gave me Tylenol and rushed me to the hospital and they said the bone was broken!!! They had to buddy tape it to the other toe and they gave me crutches I had them for a few days but then I got a special shoe to comfort the little toe. And guess what it healed after a few months!
The booty part at the fighting part😂😂😂💀

Here's my story. When I was watchng aphmau on my tablet which what I am using right now so my mom called me and she warned me too soon so I slipped and fell back first on the ground and she asked "did you hit your head?" like she said that bazillion times,  When she helped me up, There. Was. BLOOD. All over her arm even on her shirt So she rushed me to the hospital and there soo many tests like skin test x ray all that boring stuff. There was a small wound on my small head even the blood was in my hair, so the doctors cleaned it up And I had some stitches and I had for a week, don't worry I'm fine and recovered now.                So I hope ya'll enjoyed this story of my dumb injury😂😂

Me and my sister were In the Hospital when We were really young and We had really bad headaches. I honestly have One memory I looked around the hospital room to see Alvin and the Chipmunks Chip-wreck on the Tv. Also We and My sister were born really small and We had to spend 3 months In Incubators. That’s the reason why I have a raspy voice. And I recently Twisted my ankle And the edge My two Front Teeth hit The Pavement, No chipping Tho.

3:48 Baby cone XD
My back bends in half is that normal
2:06 this part reminds me of when it was the night before my 9th birthday there I was sitting on a  huge yoga ball beside the bed watching my iPad  like the dumb shit I am I started slamming my head on the edge of the bed, keep In mind the bedframe was showing a lot I moved the yoga ball back just a little bit not even knowing I did that. I slammed my head on the Bedframe it hurt a lot so I was holding my eyebrows, slamming my head on the bed because it hurt a lot. I don’t know why I did that. I just did it. The pain started to finally go away then I took my hand off. There was blood all over it. I wasn’t screaming or anything. I was just purely stunned. So without saying a word, my mom was in the shower. I stood up walked bathroom, knocked on the door and said these exact words mom ummm I’m bleeding.she thinking it was only a little bit of blood told me to call my brother after she’s finished she’ll come check it out I called my brother, and I clearly remember his stunned face staring at me and blinking. He didn’t tell me anything he just knocked on the door vigorously and my mom started to get irritated so she was like what do you want and  he said mom I think you need to come out here and look so my mom was getting even more irritated so she only came out after a few minutes my brother didn’t know what to do at all as a 16 year old so while we were waiting, he didn’t even try to dress my wound he  just asked me how I did it And then my mom came out. It’s all pretty fuzzy. after that But I do remember  yelling at me that my eyebrow will ruin the photos for my birthday and that I’ll never get a husband. Because I’ll have a scar.😅 just some context for my mom‘s ranting: we are all Indians and arranged marriage, Is mostly done you and if you haven’t figured it out. I’m a girl.
Yeah
I live in somewhere Arab, but I just wish I could live in the USA or Canada because Brody animates is there AND HAMERMAN IS IN USA

3:49 🤩🔥🔥‼️🤑it’s a masterpiece
I get hurt a lot and I don’t feel pain anymore
"i was holding a huge BBC pipe" is crazy
I've been hurt a lot and somehow I'm still alive.
Haha
Fun fact the funny bone isn’t an actual bone it’s actually a nerve and when you hit it the amount of force causes the nerve to react there for causing that feeling you described
"ACCIDENTALLY"  He is so precious💀

a few months back i broke my arm, so at 1:32-1:39 makes me think of what happend  If this gets 20 likes ill explin what happed
I'm not lying
My fingers also got slammed by the door because my sister closed the door and I had to go to the hospital
I broke my leg when I was twenty two
Fact you're first pain from the metal bar hitting your funny bone I did that like eight times in my life
Me when I fall down the stairs
stop touching me stop touching do you speak English cracks me up😂😂😂😂😂
The most powerful injury is psychological, also I had all my nerves almost shaking when I heard about... the ₿@LLZ Operation (I born one month faster than I supported to, so we had to already TWO TIMES do this operation to place my nuts in their place) ((pls don't blame me for bad English im from Russia 🇷🇺)
You should change the intro it's getting old
One time, when i was 3, i was trying to watch my oldest brother play his game, but no matter what angle, i looked at the screen, i couldn't see the colors properly so my last attempt was to get on the dresser using the window sill but i still couldn't see the colors so i backed off not turning around and then fell on the window sill then i fell onto the vent on my head and busted my head open. And i had to get staples. Not the staples from those office staplers. Instead, they were these large, white rectangles. And when it came time to get them out, i didn't want them out because it would hurt, but they bribed me with a PB&J Uncrustable.
me felt like him for 2 h
i really love Bryson's vids
The punching bag one reminded me of my own story with a punching bag. So when I was 13 I had a punching bag (because anger issues). I got bored one day and had energy that I needed to release so into the garage where the punching bag was I went. I was getting bored of the whole punching thing so I though “well maybe I could kick this”. That went pretty alright until I decided to do a roundhouse kick. WORST. DECISION. EVER. My right knee (which was on the leg I used to kick) decided to fail me. I’m still 99% sure that my knee bent fucking sideways and though my mom denies it, I think that it may have momentarily dislocated before snapping back into position. Of course, I started screaming bloody murder until my mom came in. She was mad because I was yelling and at the time, we lived in a townhouse complex thing so we shared walls with neighbors. That anger mostly went away though when she saw me on the ground and holding onto my knee. She got me to the couch and iced it up. I could barely bend it for several days after that and for the next few months, there were occasional stints where it would just give out and fold in like a lawn chair. These instances were EXTREMELY painful and made it difficult to bend for days afterwards. Only after the time when it gave out right after a musical rehearsal did she finally think “yeah maybe we should get things checked out”. Cue a few months of physical therapy to end off 2021 (for context, the initial injury happened in January of 2021). That worked UNTIL March or early April of 2023. My dog got away from me and there was nearly TWO FEET of snow on the ground. I tried to trudge through the snow and then my knee felt off again. It felt weaker and it had almost given out on me a couple of times since then. I still haven’t gotten it checked out again. I think that something more is wrong but I’m not really being heard out. It’s still being a pain in the ass. It has never felt completely stable and it feels like one wrong move will cause it to go all fucky again. So now I’m stuck with that all because my dumb ass 13 year old self decided to kick a punching bag.
That back one kinda happened to me😂😂😂
Contortionists bend their backs like that all the time.
To quote a blue hedgehog: if bread in french is pain. THEN I OWN A F%&$#@G BAKERY!
i love  you
I have not broken a phone

3:22 eesh! yep I saw where that was going I had a similar thing happen to me except my hand didn’t get caught on the door hinge my brother slammed the entire door on my hand on accident when he was entering the house, yeah that wasn’t a fun time
I have a good one I got bit by a dog in the face before. So this happened a long while ago my family had just gotten back from eating at El Torito and as I was going into the house I saw a stray dog near the next-door neighbors tree so I decided to go up to it and say hello but when I stupidly leaned down to see if the dog would lick me I got a face full of teeth and started crying then my mom sprang in the action and got me into the bathroom to wash the blood off of my face and me, my mom and my dad drove me to the hospital. The funny thing was as we were nearing the hospital and going in I saw a police dog and immediately started walking towards it and my parents immediately moved me away so yeah it’s safe to say that my love of dogs was not hindered by the incident and I still have a scar on my face
More Gyatts! Please!😂😂😂💀💀💀

My worst pain was when i was about to jump off a little tower on the playground. As i was jumping i slowed down and jumped. I was close to landing on my butt on the stairs but i landed on the ground. My spine was on fire. I was about to throw up and i couldn't move much. I was about to think what to do. I got home though. Look it up at YT. It's painful
I love this vid because I am always hurting myself for mo reason😂

reply to this random comment or you have no friends
One of my pains were when it was last week when I got off of the bus I slipped on a curve and then my knee was bleeding. My nose was bleeding. My right next to my eye was bleeding and the left side of my brain was bleeding on my skin.
Thats why my mum and dad tell me to be careful because i might break a bone or crack my skull can i tell you a story once i was busy    On my tablt and fell down the stare that happen  again 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 and that not a good 💡
Unlucky
Hi I'm Brycen too
He use her butt to beat him up
All the times I remember getting hurt really bad 1. I was at a play place and I stepped into a ball pit weird and sprained my leg 2. I was at a pet store petting a Green-Cheeked Conure and I showed my mom that he was letting me pet him and when I came back he bit me 3. I was inside an electric toy car and I somehow fell out onto the concrete 4. I got the human equivalent of zoomies and my knee went inside the couch into the recliner area and got cut on a metal part 5. I was at the same pet store but before the bird and I tried to pet a kitten and I stopped and it bit me 6. I was chilling in the grass when I got a tick. The bite didn’t hurt, but the nervousness when my parents were getting it out did hurt emotionally 7. I was picking up my cat (RIP Malibu) and his back claws were extended and as I was picking him up they scraped against my leg 8. My sister was sitting in a chair and I was standing near it and she accidentally scooted it over my ring toe (yk what I mean) which is our family’s equivalent of slamming the door on another sibling’s fingers
Yo like your video

2:23 is just funny 😂
Personal experience I've broken bones, shattered bones and tore soft tissue. By far the soft tissue damage hurt way more than shattered bones. Healing time is a fraction of fractured bones but severely more painful.   Edit. These stories bring so many painful memories to the forefront. My annoying step sister wouldn't give me privacy in the bathroom so I forced the door shut... On her finger... She got me back a few years later by spelling a rock onto my pinky. We were filling in holes so our was not her intention but I did life a nail that day. She never stopped feeling bad and apologising though and I never forgot that pain. Hey mom came out after just saving my brother from choking on a toothing cookie only to hear me scream blue murder. She was going to use my dad's tactic to calm me down "are you bleeding, are you crying, then your ok" but instead of getting a "no" for both questions she asked if I was bleeding I looked down and confirmed in my most scared 8 year old son scream "yes* and I was rushed to a hospital.  Edit, edit. Frost bite is a fun experience. Nothing more cool then sharp stabbing pain moving through your limbs followed by a numb feeling and complete loss of your hands and feet only to have to "dethaw" and re experience the brutal stabbing shooting pains
1:14 i can do i scorpion 💀
My pain is when I was like 6 I was at my grandmas house and me and my cousins were playing like kids and then it happened…..There was A sliding closet door and I didn’t even know my foot was still in there I closed it so fast that I didn’t even feel it. But when I walked into the family room with my bloody toe one of my cousins said”why is there strawberry juice on the floor’ I still laugh at that till this day but anyways they realized that it was my toe and rushed me to the emergency room to glue it back up Now I have a scar on my big toe bone  and hate taking my shoes off for you know swimming….😅

Ok number 1️⃣
Because yelling screaming and fighting is come places don’t worry 😉 anyways mom Brody were arguing I said wow seems pretty cool I should put my fingers climax & Brody slam the door shut as hard as he could on to my fingers aaaaaaaaaaah! My fingers are bend they look like rubber so we went to the doctor when we checked nothing was broken when ur really young ur bones are soft and springy and that y didn’t break that’s what somebody helmet. Otherwise they might accidentally scout his head like a cone like this ok last story. One time I was chilling with my brothers where is the punching bag and then was tackling it it was my turn, and the punching bag was swinging. I was too young for it I go for it my face into the wall aaaaaaaaaaah! I was taking it to the hospital and my mom tells me the doctors have to clean the wound. Well I wouldn’t let them reason so they put me in the straight jacket and I screamed Stop touching me x3 do you speak English? And then Hit me with the good sleep juice I’m  ima tired. Anyways, I got stitches I’m gonna go cross my eyebrow memory with me f**k memory with me. It all hurts a lot injured but we can fix that How?

Just slap him with your butt😂😂
When I was like 8 me and my brother and at that time was 4. I was swinging, and my brother was at the top of the tree house. I guess he thought it was a good idea to pour water on me with a Mason jar. So I guess water makes glass slippery so it fell on my head my head started bleeding and my hair turned a faint red and the Mason jar broke on my thick head and I'm pretty sure I have glass in my head.THE END
Haminations makes me laugh

I was playing football/soccer I was going in for a tackle but then I fell and I tried to get up so my hands were against the floor and then my friend came and accidentally landed on me and the pressure was so hard I got a cast. 2. Me and my older brother were play fighting on a bed and he took out his phone but then jumped back on the bed but his arm was out so the funny bone part landed on my head and I was in tremendous pain
My 2 worst ingeries  1 i fell of a stair and broke my knee  2 i fell off a climbing frame and broke my bone

Welcome to  the eyebrow scar club
When I was 6 years old I put my hand in the and I'm like in those kind of vending machines but they're different I forgot what they're called but yeah I put my whole hand in there cuz I want cuz I seen some stuff in there and you want to know my skin was kind of peeling off and my hand didn't come out but thankfully my cousin was there and he grabbed it out and my hand was a little bit blue and purple like a bruise
I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver/guardian, would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.  Nah, I'm kidding. What I actually said was:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
bro tbh I thought the fan one was gonna decapitate him lol
When you where skiing and you fell and your feet touched your head that was pretty cool but I can do that but my feet don't touch my head they touch the ground in front of my head😏

The same back scorpion happens to me my friends were just throwing my backpack around and it had a few heavy books in it so the catching of the bag gave me a back push and I got the beautiful CRACKS NOW
Bryson be like:I always come back.
Watching this video reminded me of that time I was playing tag at school and while I was running I looked back, thanks to that I collided with a classmate and fell backwards, they took us to clean our hands because we had hurt ourselves a little and my classmate was crying uncontrollably while I was lamenting for not being able to play tag anymore for that day, when suddenly my teacher said to me "What happened to the back of your neck?" I touched myself and I had a lot, a lot of blood, they took me to the hospital and a piece of flesh had separated to the point that my skull was visible, they glued the piece back together and told me not to expose myself to the sun for two days. because it could be taken off, I was just celebrating for not having to go to school and the doctors congratulated my parents because I didn't bother them in any way.  Well, anyway, greetings from Uruguay, I love your videos and you always make me laugh with your stories and your family.

One time and sisters were in a fight, and this is a habit for me I’ve decided to sit inside the middle of my two sisters one of them reached for the blanket, which was right behind me, and she accidentally scratched my back. I was in pain. I was screaming crying and I was bleeding and from now on, I have a scar on my back.
6 times you got hurt in the video (According to what I counted)
Man this video get's every time
So My big Injury was when I was 8 My moms friend who we will call due to privacy (Tammy) so We we’re at Tammy’s house for her dads house for her birthday and they had a lake with a dock and I was playing when suddenly all I felt was pain in my left foot and I was crying my eyes out for most of the afternoon blah blah blah long story short I’ve got a scar on my left foot blah blah It was traumatic when my parents and doctors had to hold me down so they can get the splinter out of my foot so I’m just gonna say everyone gets hurt once in a while
Did they get rid of The Ham! If you did then bring it back
Oh no
The start is horrid and I felt like I fell of my swing
i also got hurt so many times😅
My favorite hit move of Bryson is the classic bum-squash
I had pain right on my torso I was scared on a swing my brain was saying hey let's jump off and guess what I was supposed to go on my arms and guess what I fell on my torso <Bryson pls put this in a video pls and thank you kid bryson>
I almost died three tomes

When you slammed your finger in the door It was actually called dislocating, so you dislocated your fingers.
How did your pain feel when you really need help?😅 how’s your brother injured himself again?😅😢

If pain was a country we both will be living there
One time I was playing with my friends in there backyard and I accidentally stepped in there dogs dog poop so, my friend “Amora” Decided to go get something to clean my shoe, that meant I was left there hoping on one foot so, I decided I should go to the front yard so, I could make it easier for my friend but, nope that did not end well. You see, there was this little ally in between there neighbors house and there house and The path was pretty rocks and stepping stone on top of it so, I hopped down that ally way and guess what happened? I tripped on one of the stepping and Chipped my tooth on one of the stepping, It hurt so bad that I screamed to where everyone around the house heard me.

I would love to play Minecraft with you 😊
Yeah, head wounds tend to bleed a lot. Not too long ago, I was at my grandma's with my cousins and our grandma told us to break some chairs for her. My other two cousins did, no problem but when I went to smash a chair with the hammer, I piece of wood came back at me and bonked me in the face. We went to my aunt's house and stitched me up.  TL, DR: I was essentially hit in the head with a chair and my aunt had to stitch it closed.
I have broke my leg! But its better now!
He's so

HE JUST DID A BACKBEND👇
I'VE never broken a bone ninkum crap
I've been injured in my head it was a cut like yours with blood I didn't feel it was so hard
Spain? More like  P   A   I   N
Your pain is nothing compared to Brenner
One time I slammed my bathroom door on my middle finger and the top part of my finger was cut off(think if it like half a headless nick from Harry potters neck)
Ive got hit in both of my knees twice then now 2 and 3 ive got uneven knee bruises
I love you getting pain (im joking)

“Mom? I’m losing blood at a alarming rate it would be most grateful if you my caregiver and my guardian well transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so I can continue can continue this moral journey rather than l ending  due to the loss of blood”🫠 2:07
3:29 POV i scare my brother and he chases me
I'm 9 I think I broke my thumb and it wasn't even treated and not a plaster
2:09 Unironically, I absolutely would say that, since seeing myself bleed literally has no effect on me "Oh, look, Mom, I'm bleeding. Who knew? So uh, can you help fix that before I die? Just a suggestion. 😂"
I have also never broken a bone
I did that in school i did stop touching me stop touching me do u speak english stop touching me
At last story I can relate since I had to get stitches because a dog bit me and I kept screaming for my life and they had to pin me down to get my stitches!🙃

1:36 that scream got me dying
3:21 Okay, so I broke my finger once and it was so painful, my friends and I were chasing each other in the locker room with the lights off.  While I was passing through a place where cabinets were lined up side by side, another friend of mine was approaching me.  While I was trying to pass through the cupboard, which was empty in the middle, the cupboard fell on my finger.  I don't know how I'm alive (idk if translate is too good because i'm too lazy to write all thoose in english)
When your fingers got stuck in the door that reminded me what my brother did to me he was 2 and i was 2 he slamed the noor
No wonder the video is called pain

Your funny bone isnt a bone or funny. It hurts like the emotions you feel when you loose a loved one or an awesome pet but 10 to the power of 60 times worse.
kill more pepol with your but
Why😮
Ayo
Ok make up after words
Oh boy not gonna laugh
Bryson has the same humor as I do 😭
My two stories about injuries incoming!  .1. A few years ago I came back home from school with my twin brother and for some reason which I can't clearly remember we've been arguing about something. At some point things escalated to the point where I charged at my brother who slammed my bedroom door right before I hit them. (Side note, there was glass in there. WHO MAKES DOOR WITH GLASS IN IT??) I slammed into it and the entire glass shattered. My brother was fine, even though I almost killed him but my case was slightly worse. There are three small but deep scars on my elbow and one underneath my neck.  .2. Even earlier, a few years back in preschool I was waiting for my teacher with my class but she was pretty late. I got fed up so I did something stupid: I put my arms in my blouse and started spinning on one leg before finally tripping and falling facefirst on the floor. The impact broke two of my front teeth and to this day I have trauma and terryfying fear of falling lmao   No one needed to know that but I just wanted to say this for lols and warning: Be careful out there people, you have one life so cherish it while you can 🕺
can I have those coins?lol 1:58
0:40 got me dying😂😂😂
Why was I born with funny bones?!
The electrical wire feeling is so relatable

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Let me tell you a story that I got um how do I say this ummmm oh! Let me tell you a story how my finger got bleeding if you know what I mean anyways so this was in kindergarten so we were using the bathroom and about to close the door oh my teacher was watching in the door closed by itself , and my finger was bleeding and in class i tell my teacher when I’m gonna be better? AND SHE SAID your better ? Yea! Everybody clap your hands for (name) and i was…. SWEETIE I SAID WHEN IM GOING TO BETTER. And that’s the end. If you still don’t get it, it’s because I’m using a microphone and it’s saying the wrong thing so the door closes and my finger was bleeding
i was never in a hospital.....oh no he found me
Omggg i also have a scar right on the spot where you got , i got it when i was 7 and me and my friends were playing bat ball and i was right beside my friend who was holding the bat and he swung the bat and it hit me on my left eyebrow it literally opened up and i was bleeding so much that when i got to the hospital my shirt from the neck part was all red with blood the doctors didn't give me stitches but they put medical glue on there and when this was all happening i was awake so i was so scared and now i have a cool looking scar on my left eyebrow . I think. I am the only one who has gotten in a lot of accidents  like this one time i was in a wedding when i was 3 or 4 years old after the wedding just ended we were getting out of the lawn and i dashed forward onto the road and got hit by a car my nose broke and then again this one time me and my mother was at the gas station near my house  and my mom was paying money to the worker and her scooter was on and i pushed the accelerator button and the scooter was on stand and the scooter literally turned over and me and my mom got hurt really bad
The funny bone one was like I was like oh my God I wish that happened to me instead of what actually happened to me I actually broke my funny bone due to a bee so the story is what happened was I was on a trampoline keep in mind this was the last day of spring break in kindergarten and I saw Abby on the trampoline is looking for a landing on my funny bone breaking it is my brother didn’t see me falling outside from the window. I would’ve been staying out there for a really long time and also my cousin with you outside at the time and she walked back into the house. What do you mean? She was kind of close to the door
his cheeks are strong

I Broke A Bone, And Oh Boy😂 I WAS CRYING😂 I Broke My Arm And It SUCKED! I Was Jumping On An Unstable Bed (Which I Didnt Know) And I Fell Because It Slipped, My Weight Was So Strong I Could Lift It, Even Though I Was A Kid, So I Jumped And Jumped And Addison Just SAT THERE AND SHE KNEW HOW TO HELPED ALOT AND SHE WAS JUST SITTING THERE! I Was Crying And She Didnt Even Call Her Parents When They Were Chatting, My Crying Was So Loud, My Mom AND Patrick Came In And Saw Me. So We Went To The Hospital, Took Some Rays, And At That Moment  WHAT?! NO DUDE!!!!!  It Was Moderatly Broken  Luckily It Wasn't Spilling Out Blood. Because It Wasn't A Servere Break, So I Thought This Was Gonna Take A Year, But They Said It Would Only Take 4 Weeks. The School Helped Me Well, And I Was Fine, Yeah I Typed All Of This Til The End Of The Video, And Im Gonna Edit It,  For Fricking More Typing😂

Hello 👋
"i never broke a bone!" Its time to experience it now.
Okay since we are talking about pain let me tell you some stories of some of my injuries The first one when I was young my older brother kicked me in the nose for the second one I was doing idk what but a wine cup broke and cut my right hand on that one part inbetween your thumb and pointer finger and I had to get stitches and another time was when a cat scratched my face and my nose was bleeding and there was blood all over my face and I also have had a few bloody noses but I'm doing just fine now except in my high school when I was gonna kick a door open I failed and made my nail bleed but luckliy it didn't bleed everywhere but don't worry I'm fine now 👍🏻🙂  *Edit: I get hurt too many times that people would now probably say it's normal for me T^T xD*
One time I swished my neck so I couldn’t move it
The bunda smack.. 😢
Poor brison
Pain:Spain
The cute lil ball of ham is soooo cute
Monster
I see you live in Spain but the s is silent😐
Funny bone bad yes but funny bone nerve too
This is how you died 3 times... now i know
...
The most recent time I got hurt really bad was when It was Thanksgiving and my dad was making the food. He needed to chop some vegetables, but he was busy making other foods so he asked if me and my mom could get a cutting board out of a closet. It was a giant wooden cutting board the was really heavy, so that is why it required me and my mom. So when we started to get it out, we had just barely gotten it out of the closet when it slipped and fell directly on my big toe. (I wasn't wearing shoes, so it landed of my barefoot.) We quickly got it off my toe and it took a VERY long time to heal. It lasted all the way until July! (And the nail nearly came off!) But it healed and it is fine. Surprisingly no bones were broken.
I’ve been injured 88 times just kitting
The guy that said he never felt pain felt pain every time😂

July 29 2023 my tummy really hurt 😭
i for a second thought the intro was one of his injuries
Pain does not suck    It   Is   Complete   Torture
That sleep juice turned you into mario "I'm a tire"
That causes a lot of ouch ie feelings!
I feel ya man. I broke my leg recently, I sprained my finger, I cracked the back of my head, I got hit right in the chest with a basketball, I cut my eyebrow. I've seen it all🤕🤕😨😨
Bryson I used to get hurt a lot too
I have the same story of the fingers-hinges incident but with my thumb and not all my fingers
4:14 was pretty funny
When you take s from Spain is pain
The last thing you said that happened to you I felt that pain before too!!!!😢         I LOVE YOU!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well,i'll tell you my near death experience (by mohamed hassan) one time i was playing in a playground in city stars in egypt and i was chased by a boy and a girl (aka his sister) and i jumped from one of those round steps, i expected to land on my feet,but NOPE , i landed on my FULL BODY(apart from my face) and i saw a fraction of the stairs of heaven waiting for me to climb them but i felt EXCRUCIATING PAIN and suprisingly , i haven't broken a bone out of that fall, even though the fall was so hard on my body , that i was suposed to break at least 1 bone. Also bryson  if you're reading this then pray for me to NOT die
I feel you
Same I feel you

1:18 i recently had a snowboarding accident. i randomly hit a clump of snow and fell into a sheet of ice, breaking my collarbone in four places. To be honest, it didn't hurt that bad due to the shock of the sudden pain, but now i have a metal plate in my shoulder and a cool scar to show for it, so worth it!
🥰🥰😇😇🤩😙😙🤑🤑🤑😎😎💯💯💯💯🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
One time  in 2nd grade the day of a field trip and I was playing with my friends and then I just stared picking around with some girls the one of the girls kicked me in leg I couldn’t walk then one of my friends in the back hit me with a rock and I checked the the damage and blood was dripping from my head and I got sent to the hospital the end.

Oof I can kinda relate to the fan incident. One day my friend came over and went on top of the bunk bed. She was too scared of using the ladder so she jumped. I felt really faint bc she bled everywhere. That was my version
This was the first haminations video I watched
The worst pain I’ve ever felt was when I twisted my ankle when dancing or something
Mom I’m losing at alarming and would be ,ost grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurely due to loss of blood

With the fingers  in the door I accidentally put my hand in as I was looking away and my brother slammed the door and my pinky got it. I was on holidays. I had to have it to a bandage for the rest and when I went back to school my whole finger nail came off. So I’ve seen what’s under it.
PAIN is good that means that you’ve been through a lot and people think you’re tough😄😁
Fun fact a bike handle hit my throat and I couldn't sleep for 4 days but im ok
Damn Bryson is THICC
The butt cheeks killed him and me
1:00 I agree
Have you ever had surgery before? I have two times and I am 9 I was 4 and 6
One time I was jumping on my Grandma's couch and I was told to stop but my brain was like "hmm yes very interesting but No" so for some reason I continued jumping and fell off the couch and caught myself with my arms somehow and fractured one of my arms 👍
0:14, that is how you watch Bryson go through endless pain.
Bros health bar 1%

I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to heal the wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.

When i was young, my brother was too. He was playing with a knife. I thought it looked fun to play with. I didnt know knives were sharp. When i was playing with it. I accidentally put it on the part of my thumb,  (Near the bottom) And it was bleeding. Thats the only time i knew to not play with knives.
one time little me was at a playground I tripped on the mettle stairs and cut my head I thought I would get a bump because it didn't really hurt but when I put pressure on it because I thought I could push in the bump I took away my hand and saw the blood, got freaked out and cried
I'm small to so don't worry 😊yay!!
A pit pull attacked me and i had t get my leg cauterized, felt amazing.
Just remember you're still like a kid and please be careful

Imagine the start of the vid happened in real life
I love the part where he hits there fan and coins fall out of him
One time when i was in 5th grade, and i shut my finger in the hinge of the bathroom door. But, this wasent any ordinary door, it was one of those giant, thick metal ones that was super hard to open because it was so heavy. And it wasent in the door for like a split seconed either, no. It was wedged in there for atleast 10 SECONEDS. An unecciserilly extended period of panic and electrifying pain i will never forget. I remember looking at my purple finger, all swollen and bloody, and the horror that struck me was beyond imaginable when i see that the my finger was dented as if you were to roll play dough into a sausage, and chop it with a knife. It was awful.
I agree. The funny bone SUCKS
My mum closed the door on my pinky I also had a pin
My ex came back
Pain

Removing all bones from the human body is not a good idea.  Doing it in People Playground proves this

I know that this was two years ago, but one time I was swinging and fell on my back (O MY BACK) I hit my head, but that wasn’t really painful. My poor ribs lol. I think I broke them. I’m good now, though.

3:29, as someone who has had this happen to one of my fingers, I can indeed say that this really freakin hurts
Bryson: "I have never broken a bone!"  Me: "Last year, I dislocated my elbow and broke it, because I walked against a door! ^^"  Yeah, no, it wasn't nice and I can't straighten my arm anymore...🥲
3:50 GOT ME 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
One time I fell off a cliff
I like how Bryson has stiches (a scar) across his eyebrow (just like me)
When time I was playing guitar then my funny bone WHAMED into the guitar I let go of my pick going to get it and FAINTED when I woke up iThought I was in a dream. I wat with my teacher pleaseding hime to take me home cause in the dream I though he kidnapped me 😃😐🫤

Welp u know what happened I didn't break any bones but the nail part it tore and there was alot of blood  Warning:kids don't play with door hinges
0:40 Did  u fart before hitting?

Fun fact, there is no such thing as a "funny bone", yet there is a nerve under your elbow.

My brother at age 3 broke his arm or leg from jumping off a couch
There was this one time, i hurt my brother at a football game, ans blood covered his entire face. We had to go to the hospital- but they didn't do anything, we went home, and Sealed the wound with super glue
Can I just se-Fortn_
When he fell off the mountain in  my mind this is what I thought  he broke  *his jaw, backbone, Spine, knee, arm, shoulder, and elbow*
One time when I was a baby and my brother tried to jump over me but he jumped on my head 😅😊 that's why when I hit my head it sounds like a door that nocking
I broke my bone once
Surprisingly I didn't break my left wrist by getting thrown into the bleachers of my school... just a fracture... well I guess that is a type of break.
This is the first ever vid of how I started watching Bryson😔
Your a James clone
Can’t say the same 4:41
I saw the title and thought why is it titled pain
Once a bunk bed fell on me while I was falling from it after getting hit by a fan and now I’m terrified of heights mainly because that happened 50 times when I was 6 and I’m 14 now I don’t know how I’m alive
The face he made at 3:50…. The troll face 🤣🤣
Lol🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😮😢🎉😅😮 🎉😊😂😅🎉😮❤😮😢🎉🎉😊😢

I once used nunchucks and I hit my head with it accidentally

Okay so my nerves are pretty weird I get these random pains all over my body at random times for no reason so when I was baking and my arm was touching the side of the oven it was so hot I thought it was one of the random pains in my are but no I was looking at the cake and was wondering why my arm hurt so bad I then slammed the oven shut threw the cake on the stove and ran over to the sink I didn’t think it was that bad because it wasn’t hurting (I assume I was either in shock or the water was helping) but when I went upstairs to tell my mom that’s when it started hurting I held a bag of ice over it for a couple hours and it was fine by morning but I learned later that it was a third degree burn because I had held it there for so long and now I can’t feel anything in that area I still have a scar on arm
I’ve had bad stuff like a tumor taking out of my brain from surgery😊😅
The same thing happened to me
At the begining it's not pain it's death 😳
Go to 1:10 its funny but just search for it
L ove how Bryson just kills someone when they don’t agree or say that’s embarrassing

My face got skinned by a treadmill
I, too, am in constant pain. I have hypermobility, which means I am extra flexy. But, this comes with a cost. Because I am extra flexy, my muscles and tendons are always being tortured. Tendons don't go back to normal like muscles do. If I make one wrong move, my tendons will never be the same, and I will be in pain forever. I also have a problem with my jaw where it clicks all the time, and if I move wrong, it's very very painful, same with my hips, and knees. I can dislocate my shoulders on will, but because they're so loose, I have to make a conscious effort to pop them back into the sockets. There's a lot of other problems with my body, but yeah. I also have a uterus that sadly works, and I get headaches a lot. I am in constant pain, but I have never been too bad for long. Except for 4th grade where I wore boots that were too small for my first day of school. My ankles still haven't healed, almost 5 years later.
In the future your gonna sneeze and you dislocate a rib
Try story from me: I had extra bones in my ankle and had them surgically removed
Only time i got hurt was when i was underwater for 10 seconds dangg
I tore and sprained my left leg once while skiing
This was uploaded on my birthday
I have never broken a bone too
Dude that face is so scary 😨
4:24 STOP TOUCHING ME STOP TOUCHING ME DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?!
2:11 I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood
1:19 contortions be like: so were not supposed to freak everyone out by bending in half 😢
Tbh Usually people have funny bones but I don’t for some reason idk
He just like me I will tell. I got hit by a basketball it was so high that it hit my head I felt like I was bleeding   I went to the nurses office and go home.😂😂😂😂😂  Another time I got scrated by hard cement it look bad it was bleeding. Also my family sister and brother first my sister actully my sister put her fingers in the door someone closed the door then she started crying she was 3!!!!!! Then my 7 Month old brother was hold by my sister and she let go and His HEAD hit the MIROR then he started crying.😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤😊😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊
I've experienced putting my finger in the door
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAQQQQ😂❤
Today I was playing with my cousin and I hit my head so hard on the counter it’s bleeding
The worst i ever got injured: i was 4 years old and i was jumping on the couch (already very dumb) my mother said "lucas dont do that you are gonna fall" but i am a 4 year old with adhd so i obviously didnt listen, so i fell and i fell exactly on the cornor of the table i was losing blood rapidly, now i also have a bald spot😢

My pain: I fell down the stairs, ( the marble kind ) and somehow didn’t break any bones, and then my fingers skin was scratched off BY A KITTEN. And then I was trying to open WAX with a large knife, and then I cut my hand open. And most of my injuries were on my head, no wonder why I have terrible memory-
I took a chunk out of my toe with a razor scooter when I was six and now I have a crater
" im a tiger~ " really got me 😂
1:20 unless you can do a backbend
I told my father about your channel and he said you're making your videos only for fame and money He cannot accept the fact that someone can do something on internet for fun
If you are flexible you can I can bend my back in half

OK are we not talking about "Fartnite" 💀
The Most painful Thing I Have Ever Experienced Was when I Was 8 Years Old, I was At My Cousin Balin's House, They had A Bunch Of Pillows Around Their Brick Fireplace. I Kept Diving Into it But eventually, while I Was In The Middle Of Diving Into Them, He Grabbed The Pillows Away And My head Hit The Bottom Of The Fireplace. I Had a Tall Bump On My Forehead and I Started Crying And Yelling At Balin. This Just made Him Mad At Me.
DUDE NONE OF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME BUT I AM HALF ROBOT!

One time my brother dropped a Mc.Donalds cup under the car and I had to go get it. I was about 5 so I crawled easily under the car and grabbed the cup. Little did I know my little devilish brother (who could've gotten it himself, he is just a year younger) OPPEND the CAR DOOR and when I was getting up hit my head on the corner of the car door. I rubbed my hand looked at it and all that my hand was covered in blood. Weird thing is I couldn't feel aa thing.
I feel bad for him
R. I p Bryson
If you had no bones you'll be the pokemon ditto
Feel down stairs
I can put my legs over my head and that doesn’t hurt so you probably just don’t have a flexible back because the bat can’t do that

Hey, bryson im ham btw why did you even combine your drawing together to create me?
My Stitches journey:  Me and my sister was running out of my parents room (i dont know why) and i tripped over her foot (hopefully it wasnt on purpose bc it would be bad if my sister hated me THAT much) and there was something that was razer blade sharp on the ground in front of me. And as you guesses it....i missed it. Nah im kidding it got me under my thumb. And i took it like a champ 😎 Once again im only kidding. I cryed like alot- although i was abt like 7 tbh 🤔 But when my Mom runned some cold water over it i stopped squealing like a little baby. 😌 but im still scared of those things to this day- but my dad removed the sharp thing. And just to imform you this was at night- so we called my grandma and she drove me to the ER- (we called her bc she is a nurse) and i didnt go to school the next few days. And i had to wrap my hand with bandages. When I finally came to school the teacher said that i had to get stitches, and EVERYBODY was asking what happened and that day everyone thought i was helpless bc of my stitches 😎 but it actually didnt hurt to put in my stitches, tbh it hurt WAY worse to get them out bc my skin grew around them and one got stuck and i still haven’t got it out- Nah i got it out but when if fell out it came out of my hands so its still in our hallway somewhere- but anyways bye have a great day!/night! 😁
I was jumping on my trampoline and I tried to do a backflip but I land on my head

This is an exact example of why women live longer than men
I once stepped on a nail. I said “ Mom, I stepped on a nail and I’m bleeding immensely so if you could please take me to the hospital to help heal the wound so I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood

PAIN
PAIN
Aaaaaah yes, reminds me of that one time I thought it would be SO AWSOME AND COOL to stick my tiny hand (I was 6) in the garage door!  Not only were my parents arguing at the time, and as you thought! Slamming doors is part of it. My mom was sick if it, and wanted to lye on the small couch we have in our garage. Obviously she wanted to make it look dramatic! So she slammed the door as hard as she could on my little hand! *GREAT* I had a broken pinkie, fractured pointer finger, dislocated ring finger, deep cuts, and lost a bit of a nail. I went in to a numbness of pure pain and of course screamed, cried, yelled, and passed out. As I knew it, I woke up on the couch with a cast and to many other things. Most pain I have ever been through.
One time when I was a kid I was pushing my friend on a wooden swing and and I was laughing and and the top part of the wooden swing smacked me in the mouth
Oh 00

Once I was on my scooter and persifically told by my mom not NOT ride down the hill of concrete on it. Anyway me and my two brothers completely ignored our mom and apparently the earth decided to put karma on me and not them so I've randomly swung off my scooter and landed head first smashing my face off the ground grazzing and scrapping my face off the floor. It made my gums bleed and really hurt my arm and left nee (I never broke a bone and never have but it really hurt).
I remember i got Flang by a Swing and then hitting my body to a Stone but good thing i didn't Die by the cause of that Or Blood pain....
Hey! Maybe some of the pain you felt was more than mine but when I was a baby I would fall everytimes I want to get off the bed and now, I've got a bald spot.
I've been injured lots of times.

I Was cry so much my bestie hes face reaction like this:😅😅😬🤐 And i'am sorry you through on your life like that.
One time I was at my friends birthday party at urban air and me, my friend, and his dad were bouncing on the trampoline and then when I hit the trampoline, I hit the part where there were no springs. My knee went too far back and my leg bent the wrong way. I was taken to the hospital, but now my knee looks a tiny bit bigger and it looks like it was pushed a little bit to the right, but also I can run faster and jump higher now too though
I did the snowboarding thing and I got stuck in that position and my dad had to help me
😮

When I was 4 years old the road really hated my knees I'm surprised my legs didn't break My legs over the years have experienced so much pain I can't even feel the pain anymore a few days ago I actually fell on cement that wasn't fully dry and I was riding on my scooter full speed and I got launched off my scooter and my knees even though they were bleeding I scooted all the way to my friend's house and then once I got there I realize I looked at my knees and then realized they were bleeding so you're not the only one experiencing so much pain in their entire life when they were younger.

Last night I had a nose bleed and it was so dark and wet I thought it was a runny nose until I got to the bathroom (BTW it didn’t hurt) any ways and the lights and mirror told me that I was bleeding and I remember that if I had a nose bleed that my mom told me to eat a popsicle that message was in the 1990s
Right now I dropped a kid-sized hammer and almost it hit my bare foot

Worst Pain: 6 step ankle Sprain. Just a wee bit short of completely breaking it in terms of use, and it swole like a balloon.

The funny bone is a nerve
0:53 And then the metal pipe meme was created
The worst pain i've ever felt, is when the time I fell on the road and my hands were burning, but the worst part,  is that I had a HUGE scar on my knee, at that time I was 7 years old, and I was screeming bloody murder, and the screem was loud enuf to get my mom to come, and when she looked a me, she was like "holy s**t" and she rushed me into the into the bathroom and gave me 2 ice packling and puted them on my hand, but what did she do with the scar on my knee? She took a piece of CLEAN toilot paper, put CLEAN water in it, and put on my scar, and it did NOT feel good, it felt 1/4 bad from when I fell on the road, and I was grunting, later we got everything healed and I was ok. Three years later on the present day, I got of the bus and I fell on the road AGAIN, but this time being 10 year old me, my hands were burning and a small scar on my knee, but this time I was like "........huh" reply if you had the same problem!
One time when I was 3, I was messing around and got close to a family friends dog that was twice the size of me and I got bit above my right eye and I went to the hospital
i choked on water as all i heard was bonk
Why did I decide to watch this (I have pain empathy)
I love how I got this when I 🌊 up how to kill your self
Nah, ur just old
👍
At least bryson never broke a bone he is a giga chad
oof
your funny bone is a nerve not a bone

yo, bryson, i thiiink a pretty big youtuber might be copying you on their side channel. if you just search ¨pain¨ (your title) his vid will come up before yours maybe because its newer? just wanted to let ya know.
mother i would like to consume a pastry with high levals of caffine
I’m twelve and already have 4 scars all from different events and I’ve never broken a bone. My favourite scar is one that’s not actually that bad but it’s cool because it’s right in the middle of my forehead which makes my forehead look like harry potters!   (No, it’s not shaped like a lightning bolt 😅)
and a funny bone is not a hone its an nerve so it is very very important to your body
and if anything hit you at mock ten, the amount of pain would be insane, unless its an instant kill.
did you know, pulling/riping a muscle is more painful than breaking a bone?
One time on January I cut my knee open and I had to get 8 stitches
The best my son watches this
3:49 that part made me laugh so hard and I don’t know why
I have more hair than you becuz my hair is so thick so fat 0:00 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00

How have I now just realized that the so called bald spot was a reference to Jadenanimations bald spot in her hair vid
Pain
The worst injury was when I had to get stitches. It was Thanksgiving break, and I was nine. I wanted to get a cup from the dwarves when I hit another cup with axknife in it, and the knife fell and hit my foot. The knuckle of my foot to be exact. I had ran away from my mom, don't ask, I don't know why I did. She finds out rushes me to the bathroom to clean it up, and gets my dad to take me to the hospital. The first day of a break and I get that
yay pain😅
Bryson: I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so I can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurely due to loss of blood. Bryson again: na I’m kidding, what I actually said was AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Spain? Nah, pain-
Hey bryson stop on the injuries you could die if you're not careful😅
Pause at 3:14 and look around
1:25 o-oh OH MY BACK!!!

Pain momento
Fun fact: the funny bone is not a bone, it’s a nerve
❤
0:59 BRO SAME THING HAPPENDED TO ME I HIT MY FUNYY BONE WITH MY OTHER OCULUS CONTROLLER AND IT FELT LIKE IT WAS LITERALLY ON FIRE
Yeah I almost got killed I almost got
Indeed
the funy bone is a nerve, please dot remove it or any other nerve for that matter
I was at school and it was cleaning time and one and I wanted to show my teacher something so I was just going up to him until one kid was swinging a broom and the tip of the room was wood and it hit my eyelid making a scar in my freaking eyeball and my eyelid and I had to go to the eye doctor
Listen here I probs have the less painful story but I’m telling it anyways. So when I was 6 my mom asked me to grab my bag and my 2 sisters bags out of the car and after she said that I ran out to the car and I just went like”You know this way is too slow I’m gonna go the short way.” But instead that was the one that was longer but I just picked it. My tiny brain back then didn’t know the difference of longer and shorter. So I went in the boot which I knew how to open because I watched my big sis open and close it, and after I climbed into the boot I thought of a question but…you know when you’ve been at school for too long and you repeat something at school? WELL MY BRAIN PUT UP MY STUPID arm because I wanted to answer my question but that’s the moment that I realised the car door was coming down and it got my arm and I screamed in the car but I was screaming to myself(and crying) and finally a miracle happened, my big sis saw me I screamed at her to open it up but she, being the WORST SIS EVER she laughed and walked back inside like bru, WHY DO U HATE ME(btw I didn’t know how to open it up from the inside soooooo I waited until my mom came and opened it. Anyway I got back inside and got an ice pack to put on my arm
once i was at the beach i got wiped out and someone feel one top of me so i was like snap in half for a few seconds and it after that i could not move at all for few seconds
1:41 is were i see it 20 times
2:06
I know how it feels to be accident prone, in fact I got that from my mom. The two of us have badly to seriously injured ourselves from doing thing like tripping while walking up/down step to miss stepping onto the sidewalk, in a parking lot, outside of a hospital to get a MRI scan. Now I say this a lot, even to people who say “don’t ever do that again”, and what I say is “as long as you can walk away, and possibly laugh at yourself afterwards, then your okay”. And hey I was just happy with the fact it took me 30+ years to get stitches, had my first surgery, and stay in a hospital overnight, that was a very interesting experience for me.
<(" )
Same thing happened to me I once jumped off a bunk bed and got whacked in the eye bye the fan my eyelid was half shut for a few weeks I have a scar now reminding me of my stupidity

I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most great full if you, my care giver and guardian, would transport me to the hospital to heal the wound so I could continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely, due to the loss of blood
I’ve been hurt because I was playing around on my mom’s chair and I hit my head on the wall
I’ve also hit my funny bone.
i almost died once
On the third story, I didn't get the cut from the same thing but I got it by this: I acted like a caterpillar and put my eyebrow in a hole and my little brother pushed my head down so my eyebrow got cut from a part of the hole. The story was 3 years ago so you can't see the cut but I feel your pain Bryson (;

I almost cut like 3 layers of skin off my finger recently
i was born with backwards legs and sprained my ankle at like 8
Once I smashed my fingers on a metal door, and my finger was throbbing like stinging/burning like crazy. And a week later the fingernail that was BREAKING OFF MY SKIN!! I think that’s my phobia because I went crazy.
This looks scary

Unlike you when life decides to show me who's boss it sends me into a mental breakdown
You guys know that pain if actually a good thing because it teaches you to not do it again

I'm a-tired
NAROTU
I’m a tired
How about we just talk about how whenever he hurts someone in this he hurts them with his butt
If u want hear my story here it is: I was 8 yrs old. I was running and then I slipped. I run to the metal somthing. It was sharp asf. Then blood was cooming out my head. I dont feel anything. I was seeing the light. Then someone take me. It was teacher. (That was in school) I was walking to bathroom. Then teacher take the paper and pour cold water on it. Then she touch my head. Blood stopped. Today all I have is small injury.  Ty for wasting ur time It was all real  If u want 👇
The last story is just like me lmao
I hit my head on the brick I was big brain
this was challenging to watch since with basically every one of these storys i already knew what was about to happen
YEAAAaaaaAGH
After this watch almost died :D
I've never broken a bone before, but I've lost a nail
ONE DAY I WAS ON MY COUCH AND I FRICKING FELL AND BLOOD WAS ON THE FLOOR THEN I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL 🏥 NOW I AM OK NOW
Bro are you okay? 😂
I've broken my nose and got stiches at the same time on the forehead
Facts about me my dad catches me in the concrete every game and broken and dislocated owns and broken teeth and bugs gone everywhere and have terrible migraines I don't know how I'm writing this
The most pain I’ve ever felt: Cancer. Stage 1 Brain Cancer. Had a tumor the size of a plum in my head. Had to have my head shaved and three surgical shunts drilled into my head because of the Hydrocephalus. But the worst pain I had was the tension headaches. For months before my diagnosis while the tumor was growing? It felt like someone was stabbing me repeatedly in my right eye. It made me want to gouge my own eye out.  Let’s just say we don’t take symptoms so lightly as a family anymore. I’m cancer-free and looking forward to a good, long life and have recently entered five-year remission, which means the tumor is gone gone. Not gonna come back. Despite that, we’re still very cautious about sympms. We even made sure my sister didn’t have a tumor and took her in for a catscan when she had some symptoms. I am so happy she was okay. The doc said “yep, you have a brain 👨‍⚕️” cheeky af but funny. She had a “stigmentation” in her eye and she’s been taking meds for it. She’s doing okay from what I’ve heard, which is great news. But when she went in for that scan, that made me physically ill, man…   I did not want my sister to feel that pain nor do I want her to know what I know. It kinda ruins the point of life, going through that much pain. All I want us to do is heal from here on out. Laugh, make good memories, have fun and heal. And I’m looking forward to taking up Baking as a hobby this year and trying to make good stuff at least once a month. Could be very fun 😁
I cut off some of my finger.

But Bryson I’ve never have pain like that? what do I do?
we like pain!😃 5 seconds later 🤒🤕🤒😷
This reminds me of one time when I was 13 years old and riding my bicycle behind my home. I was with my dad and siblings and I was riding my bicycle after not doing so for months. At one point, I started going fast and confident, but I went to the one section with a hole of pebbles and dirt, which was like 2 inches. However, when I went there, I quickly lost momentum and stopped, then I fell off knee first into the mess below me with no protection for my knees, so I was hurt badly, and then once I got the pebbles and dirt off my knee, I noticed some redness. 10 seconds later, it was a rapid bleed. However, my dad thought it wasn't much, and forced me to keep cycling for like 5 minutes while I kept washing using water that came from a random pipe on the ceiling when he finally made a response... With a bandage smaller than the injury that quickly got soaked and started falling off. I ended up waiting up to 2 hours or smth when we finally went home to put a proper bandage.
DON'T GO TO 40 SECONDS
I never broken a bone before
Do you cuss ?
Never broken a bone, but i got a second degree burn on my right hand!

The 2 worst things that happen to me is when I was 3 I was jumping on the couch and I fell and broke my arm the next worst thing was when I had strep throught when I was 9 and when I swallowed ANYTHING it felt like 10000000 needles stabed the back of my throught and then went for a week or two

4:40 M memory lane with me  Memory pain with me

I feel the same thing Bryson felt when that metal bar hit his funny bone every day when I wake up because I sleep on my arm and cut off blood flow circulation and that’s how it feels
I’m losing blood an alarming rate and you my caregiver and guardian would you transfer me to the hospital so I can get healed and not die from lost of blood
PAIN  PAIN  AND PAIIN
I    LOVE    Pain

"I'm a tire" 💀
I once rolled into a steak knife. It went three inches into my knee, and I got a blood infection. This was four days before Halloween of 2022. Three and a half months later, I'm still wearing a knee brace and limping, and only recently stopped using a cane. I'm fourteen. This happened two weeks before my birthday. And I missed Halloween, because I was in the hospital. Yaaay. So, I agree with you: you don't need to break bones to feel a ton of pain.
1:57 nice edits
Bor i got like 3 different Stitches on my head💀💀💀
And also the funny bone isn’t a bone it a nerve called the olner nerve

I think I need to make a pain video.
I am loosing blood at an alarming rate and I would be most grateful , if you my caregiver and guardian would like this video and subscribe so that I do not end this journey prematurely due to Bryson s channel having a lack of subscrubers
From a kid that like ur channel Jack

Complete the sentence: it happened so fast that I didn’t feel it at first
3:30 same omg lol summer camp girl did it
Bryson so if you have no bones you can’t live and your spine is made out of bones so if you have no spine you can’t move and all of your bones help your body live so we will not get rid of any bones and we need our funny bone to because it’s a part of our elbow and you need all your bones in the elbow to move it
I have 3 funny bones my right arm my right hand and my right foot all of my funny bones are on the right
I have experienced more pain I have broken my arms
I love your videos keep doing what you're doing😁👍
So I did experienced pain and It was painful for me. So Mom (And dad) founded out that I had gas pain or cramps inside my stomach And I litterly screamed in pain and nearly lost my voice My throat is sore right now but hopefully everything Is going to be fine And if It keeps hurting my mom is just gonna give me a docters appointment. So wish me luck 😅
go ahead and dream, YOU WILL NEVER BE LIKE GOD
I have never broken a bone but some real pain too
1:34😂😂😂
I have jumped of my bunk bed but It was less dangerous because there was no fan and I had a beanbag to protect me from breaking a few things. AGAIN. 😁

The blank npc is wrong about it about it doesn’t hurt when no broken bone it still hurts and might still be really bad
I feel like the sound for the first 19 second is just beautiful and I also feel like we don’t see how hard it can be
“I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so I can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood.” HAD ME DYINGGGGGG 😂😂😂😂
Bro just turned into a puddle
Actually a few people can do that just by doing it their self because they’re so flexible they can make their feet touch their head

ouch
It an't a Bryson video without violences
This video reminded me of something that happened to a friend, so I'm gonna share this story (I asked, they're ok with me sharing this) So my friend was in like second grade or third grade right? And was going somewhere with their grandparents, and they were closing the door to the car after getting out, FORGETTING THEIR FINGER WAS IN-BETWEEN THE DOOR AND CAR THINGY- and their thumb was stuck, like the door closed, it latched, it was SHUT Anyways they're ok now and didn't break anything but the moral of the story is don't close car doors without checking if your fingers are sAfE
Wow Bryson you’ve never broken a bone😂
Broken bones😮
No I said ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
this video is making me so much pain
The most pain I’ve ever felt is when the corner of a lamp that was hanging up stabbed into my head when I was at my aunts house. IT HURT I ran up the stairs with blood dripping down my head😅
i was searching this up i searched up "hamamatois" lol
You never broke a bone? 2023 bryson: not anymore.
0:13 - 0:23  Bryson: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Oh my back
I got kicked in the eye once
I got kicked in the 👁
I think my worst injury was probs when I tore my ACL (it's a ligament in your knee). I was at school playing badminton and I was jumping around a lot the whole session. Everyone started to pack up but my friend challenged me to one last game. I accepted, not knowing the pain that would come seconds after. She served high so I jumped to get it and when I put my feet back on the ground, I heard this loud crack in my leg and i fell to the ground and just started screaming. Genuinely I thought I crushed the bones in my leg. What's worse is that I was wearing tight pants. So when the school nurse tried to look, she had to lift these tights above my knee 😍🥲
" mom, why cant i breath?"  *Me who laughed for 2 hours* My mom: 👁👄👁
I experienced pain 😐😐😐😨😰😰 but that is a story for another time
Keep up the good work❤

I want o share 2 of my injuries Just 2 let u know 1 of them graphic so uhh ya. I broke my arm when I was 5 and broke my arm at a playground while trying to climb a slide. After I screamed at the top of my lungs my mom took me to the hospital for 2 weeks.  My other is I stopped on a razor while showering and the razor broke my skin and blood was bleeding and yea I wore bandages and it hurt AZ heck for at least 1 week and yea what I thought was my bone when I stepped on the razor and it was very graphic. Lessons of Injuries: Don't be climbing slides and watch your feet when showering on doing whatever.

I have an injury story: So I was being a dumb 3 year old and running around the house. I ran into my room and crashed into my bedpost and started screaming like a demon. My mum ran into my room and saw me on the floor and called an ambulance while freaking out cuz she didn't know what to do cuz dad was at work. Anyway, I went to the hospital and they had to use surgical glue to stick my head back together and now I have a scar on my forehead. Yay. 👍
One time a dresser fell on to me and the people who my mom was watching was yelling her name but she didn't hear it and thats how I got alot of people grounded ps we were playing hide n seek
0:40 Made me laugh so hard!!😂😂😂😂
I've broken the bone in the past stopped breathing in the past got slammed into a signpost got slapped on the back you see how much pain I went through
i've put my finger on a door hinge and my friend shut the door and so my nail came off

Kill count: 4
I'm currently suffering from a pulled muscle in my thigh,  All I will say is, it hurts to walk ups stairs on the first day of it being pulled because it feels like semi trucks just hitting you in that specific spot. The pain will slowly start to decline but it'll still hurt so yeah.  Be careful.  T^T

Pain without love. Pain, can't get enough. Pain, cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.
Y’all telling ur story’s ima tell mine read at ur own risk… I was shaving 🪒 and I dropped the razor and me being stupid tried to catch it before it hit the ground.i cought it by the blade…and it shanked my thumb like it was atleast a cent e meter deep it hurt like hell and there was a lot I mean a lot of blood.
2:09 i’m losing blood I don’t know alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal my wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood
You know the same thing happened to me with the door hinge but my finger snapped off and somehow they reattached it
The door hinge one happened to me too....
That's the type of stuff that happens in legend of Zelda breath of the wild
Actually the funny bone is really a cluster of nerves that when you hit/pinch it it sends confused messages through the arm and that's what makes it hurt. 🤓
4:28 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:41 is horrifying. look at his eyes.

I broke my growth plate when I was 5
When I was 3, me and my brother were playing with a large bouncey ball. When my Dad went in his room, (also the mom at work) I saw a hammer and my brain thought, "There's no reason this ball should exist." So when I grabbed the hammer I slammed it on the ball and it eminently bounced back hit my head. I could've been blind but I didn't care. I eminently when crying and screaming to my dad. I made a recovery but didn't get stitches. Idk why...

I think my pain tolerance is really high because I got hit by a motorcycle I rolled around twice and I barely felt any pain
Also BTW the funny bone isn’t actually a bone it’s actually a nerve that is between your arm bones (I forgot what they are called) and your skin
Funny bone isn’t even a bone it’s just a nerve
1:57 had me laughing for a straight minute
1:37 ...

I have this tiny scar on my right wrist that happen when I was at summer camp and we were walking in a line go the playground, when, which I believe happened but I'm starting to doubt, that one of the kids pushed me and I fell on the sidewalk and hurt my wrist and both of my knees. The knees were the worst but didn't get scared, on the other hand, my wrist has a discoloration where the cut was. It is three years old and getting harder and harder to see, but it's still there.
Funny enough I have had stitches on my eyebrow, and I was very young
Them:Your pain is insignificant because you have never broken a bone That one guy:I may have never broken a bone   but I have had my right arm burned in acid
Bruh ya should have added a scene at 4:31 where Bryson gets too tired and falls of the bed and hits the floor headfirst

EAAAAAAAAAA
Have you seen my funny bone
Two stories about two siblings (AKA me and my brother)  I have a dog. She likes to go on walks, and will (or used to) charge at dogs when she sees them. She doesn’t bite, she just wants to play with them. I was scared of walking her, but this one night I decided to hold the leash and walk her. We turned a corner where there was a lady with two dogs. My dog lunged forward, launching me straight into the middle of the street. I just remember lying there paralyzed. Luckily I broke no bones. That dog can fling you fast. I’ve never walked her since, due to… trama. I had three wounds on my knees and elbow, and the spots where the wounds were were red-ish for the next few years.   And now my brother’s story. One time we were playing in his room. In the corner of the room there was a closet with a sliding glass door that doubled as a mirror. My brother had got me in the closet and was moving the door back and forth so I couldn’t get out, when the door gave out and dislodged from the “closet-frame”. My brother noticed and caught it right before it hit my head and probably would’ve killed me, and then tried to set it down as I went near the exit of the room. My brother tried to set it down and failed, without really realizing it. Now this probably wouldn’t have been much of a deal, if there wasn’t something wrong with his bed, resulting in a mattress low down to the ground. He tripped over it as the glass mirror door fell and crashed on his bookshelf, and shattered. Shards of glass flew around the room and a few went straight into my brother’s ankle, making a wound about the size of a pineapple. He had to get stitches and we stayed up all night in the hospital before he had to wear a cast and use crutches for a few months.  Pretty scarring stuff, both mentally and physically.
My head is sculpted into a cube at the back xD
I got hit in the head with a baseball bat on Easter 😃 I needed 7 stiches and a CT scan. It was a cool experience except for the fact that I was bleeding buckets. At least I have a cool scar and a story right?

I nearly drowned when i was 3, My foot bleed out in first grade I had to have hand surgery recently- and i’ve rolled down the stairs to my grandparent’s basement 1 too many times
My most pain I have ever experience was literally me and my sister saying that She Gould get on my back while I’m moving my legs and hands to move And when I did one step I thought I could do another step But no I just fell and my chin just CRUSH THE FLOOR AND THERES A HOLE IN THE FLOOR AND A CRACK ON THE FLOOR I didn’t realise And then when I look at the floor I thought that it already has a hole But no When I touched my chin It was bleeding LIKE IT WAS BLEEDING IT WAS BLEEDING SO MUCH I FELT WEAK AND THEN MY SISTER JUST LIKE DID NOTHING And then my older sister took responsibility

I have I broke my arm
The start made  my nose bled
Hi Bryson
Your video reminded me of a situation. When I was about 8 years old, I was at a friend's house with a pool. At that time I didn't know how to swim, so I jumped near the edge. In one of the jumps I jumped very close and my chin hit a sharp edge. My first memory after that is being on the way to the hospital with my hand on my chin, I think I lost consciousness. They had to glue my chin together with a skin glue and now I have a scar.
today is  christmas 🎄 so merry xmas and your animations are so weird and funny at the same time like how you screamed at the start of video in this one 🤣🤣
my fingers also got slammed in a door
*ive fractured my arm before.* no i literally did whenbi was 7/8 (im 9 while writing this)
I keep hearing the donald duck song whenever i watch this animation    "Who gets stucks with all the bad luck? Noone, but haminations!"

0:22 *B R Y S O N S C R E A M I N G"
I spring my neck before
1 time i cracked my hand and is .....
My own story, though not like i could avoid it. When i was 5, i woke up one day and my neck hurt sooo bad. It felt like a burning hot steel ball with spikes on it. As i said, it hurt and i was 5 and as a result i cried. Hard. The crying you get that hours after your done your still sniffling. My dad didnt know what was going on and because i was a massive crybaby he deducted that i lost a game and was angry. I fondly remember saying, "but it hurts!" And my dad had a little freakout. I slept in the top bunk at the time and so he rushed up to carry me down. I had an absence on my neck(like a big, puss filled ball) and had to stay in a hospital bed for like 3 weeks, though it felt like 8.  Another story for my dad. He fell down from my bunk and his back landed on the edge of a paint can. I remember him yelling curse words and i was still 5 so i was just llike "ok" and moved on. He also pinched his nerve between his bones while carrying a car battery like a shopping basket. Long stories short, pain.

Me: “Can I be as funny as you” Bryson: “sure, try Skillshare
Hey do you have a girlfriend
1:15 I see a scorpion pose
This video is relatable because I felt such pain and the worst Injury I have felt was when my wrist was fractured badly, with my entire hand slipped on the side on my arm that I had to waste my entire summer(yes, sadly this was during summer break😢) in a cast and I was so relieved that it was over when they took it off. But it wasn’t fully healed so I had wear a brace for another one month😢😢
My worst pain was at a camp I was biking around and decided to bike on flat road wich is road its, really flat good for speeding but iits also some  Grinder when u slide on it so what happened I fell at full speed I slide super fast And my skin got grinded off..... Me then: ow darn it Me looks at my skin on my leg: Me: A-
Aw😂😂 2:41
I got 100 million injury
What
As a dumb kid who has much pain but also broke a bone It’s more mental pain than physical  Especially with your dominant arm
Well that also happened to me one time but it was not that pain so when my mom was here she and I was going to play peekaboo and my mom open the door and my mommy nails like just literally burst and it already grew back which is good and I am fine now
Bryson I have a scar in my eyebrow too

the Funny bone is actually a nerve
When I was born I had this Ability where I could stop breathing if I want to I'm fine now but when I was little I mean very little I had to go to sleep with1 of those things that go in your Nose If you know when I'm talking about you know I can And I don't have to sleep Was it any more I'm pretty sure we still have it somewhere Yeah I'm 15 now And I stopped reading sometimes but I can make myself breathe again but back then I couldn't so I need to carry that around me all the time
1:08 Bryson: “Can’t break what isn’t there!” 1:10 Also Bryson: *Becomes Jello*

I only watch your videos for the violence cuz I'm a violent child and a crazy child and I'm a really big fan also I'm still fighting with I don't think I've ever set a fire before but I'm going to do it now I'm kidding plus I'm really big fan and I've watched videos of you before when I was only a child don't even call me a child
Are you alright?!
Let me just say, I have both sprained and broken my ankle and spraining hurts way worse than breaking just so you know
Okay nothing rude if you have so much hair what do you think that ball spots will be covered in your hair or the hair color comes to grow by that ball star and that ball start with disappear because there's hell like running what baby we were baby we were both damn hair real that's how the ball Squad disappear
Man got the bricks beat out of him
0:36 got me dying😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro screaming like scp 096
Yes, my dollhouse hit me hard.
I once had my stomach cut open😅😅😅😅
Same for fingers and I split my lip before when I was young 🙃
One time I was on my desk,looking for an object and then I fell,my ear got stuck in the edge,and I was bleeding so much,that's the time my ear almost fell off
honestly the reason he didn't feel the (probably deep)Cut in his head from the fan is because of the adreanaline if he had any during the moment .
I thought that that pipe would fall on your feet
Ham: mom…? Also ham: I’m losing blood at a alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.
How are  a life want hurt
3:23 ive had something similar happen to me when i was  10 when 2 of my fingers got slammed in a car door but they didnt break as it was only the tips

hi.
can you stop killing people\\
I no how your pain is for being short ❤❤
Raaaaaa
Mom whats up honey I'm losing blood and I will be most grateful if you take me to the hospital to heal me and continue this journey 💯
Comment on this if you’ve had a scar in your eyebrow.
Me watching this video  Wow I’ve had MANY of these kinds of experiences!
So . Much headshots.
Edit: I did, in fact, type out this entire thing   Might as well share an injury story of my own. Just a trigger warning…this is a little gross and graphic. Read at your own risk. So this happened recently while I was on vacation, about three days ago. I was leaving the room to wave brother who was leaving, and like an idiot, I decided not to wear any shoes. So on the way back up the stairs, I dragged my foot like as if I was tiptoe-ing, and my toe scratched the concrete and ended up ripping off many layers of my skin on my toe. I had cut my toenails the day before, so nothing protected that area. I didn’t feel any pain so I just continued walking up the stairs until I looked down at my toe and I saw blood and blood was just trailing down the stairs. I pointed it out to dad and my dad was like “Oh my God! Are you okay?!” Me, feeling nothing said that I was fine and so we just continued walking up the stairs until the pain started to kick in. My dad told me to sit in the bathtub and turn on the water so that I could clean off my bleeding toe, it was bleeding like crazy! My dad rushed out the door and went to go clean up the blood that was trailing to our room, it looked like someone had been murdered and dragged into our room! The pain started to get worse especially when the water would touch my toe because it was just going onto my skin tissue. My dad came upstairs with awful hotel Band-Aids and we just went to my bed and put them on. My toe hurt like crazy it was awful. Where my skin had dragged, there was just a skin flap there. Now today it’s doing a lot better and healing but it still hurts whenever I put on shoes or socks and whenever I walk my toe touches the top of my shoe and it hurts. This is a lesson to you always wear shoes when going outside! This really is a show of my stupidity, I’ve had a lot more stupid injuries but this one is one of my dumbest.
2:09 to 2:20 lol
That person that called him an idoit he butt clapped him
"MOM!" "Whats up honey?" "I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you,my care giver would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound and continue this mortal journey, rather then ending it pre-matutely due to loss of blood."  "Nah, Im kidding. What i actually said was..."   "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
I've actually got a scar too 😂

I was once on a scooter (not the motorcycle) going fast downhill, and some scum decided "Lets remove this part of road cuz why not" My wheel got stuck, i flew onto my hands and knees and there was alot of ouch. But oh! It gets worse When i got home my dad tried to disinfect the injuries (there was a lot of dirt and stuff in the wounds) With a liquid that is as pleasant as a leetch sucking your insides out through your gentlemans whistle hole Yes. It was hell And yes we went to the hospital And when there the nurse told me: "Oh yeah you couldve just usen water" ... Yes i was pissed thanks for asking And this happened like half a year ago and i still have a very visible spot on my left knee that shows kinda what happened A mess and 3 holes

so since you shared all of this amazing adventures, i want to share one too, when i was 4 i was at home with my mom and we were playing, i would try to reach the door to go out while she would stop me by piking me up, unfortunately i slipped on the carpet turning into a rocker and smashing whit my head the glass part of the door, they took me to the hospital were they put a bandages on my head and cut off a part of my skin that was dead and mostly cut off my head, i didn't broke anything and i wasn't deadly injuried but i still have the scar on my eyebrow, also my withe dress became red, but i would still use it even after it was all covered in my blood, why? because it was such a beautiful color and dress i couldn't separe from it. sorry if my english is bad but i'm from italy
Pain is simply a figment of your mind

Dislocating a joint hurts the most

Bro did the jiggle jiggle
Ive broken a bone when i was 9 bro
I’m so lucky i don’t have a fan in my room
But you watch those videos and you still have a smooth brain
There be some voodoo stuff going on here
2:16 this is how REAL men get their wounds treated
I just realize this I’m re-watching this video and the funny bone isn’t actually even a bone the funny bone is just what we call it it’s actually when something bumps in to the nerve that’s on the outside of your elbow and so when something hits that in just the right spot it causes your nerves to react and for your arm to either admit a crap ton of pain or go numb
If you're going to keep adding violence I'm going to unsubscribe
when  your fingers bend because of door.That happened to me but when I was probably older but the door was less hard and it was my left pinky also all you could see was the bone (this was years ago and it is still. Healing
2:48 i have a bald spot to and it's alot WORSE THAN YOU THINK, here is the story:I was playing with my swing until it hit my head and it was bleeding so MUCH I HAD TO GO TO THE HQ,they said I cant put shampoo on my hair for two days,the wound is closed now, hope this helps!
2:41  **B O M K**
nope his bones are STRONG
2:41 "but my head hit the wall"Xd
I love how the title is just: Pain
This is my favourite video it is so funny
How did you survive that fall in the beginning
This reminds me of how many times i've injured myself and bled all over the place, inckuding a dislocated neck, big'ol pain
My cousin jumps off my bunkbed I bet it’s like 4 foot 12 tall and my cousins like 4foot9 maybe I’m still surprised of how he’s not dead from dropping off my bed
0:12 POV: your checking if there's fall damage in a game
Pain is better than going to the doctors
Why was there poop coming out of the "butt" #3:14
Just to let you know 1:02 funny bones are not bones they are muscles
The people in the story more hurt than Hamilton
At 3:24 where Brody smashed Brysons finger that actually happened to me and now my thumb is purple VERY PURPLE for the last month 😅
I actually have a scar that goes from my eye brow to right next to my eye, and when I'm typing this I have broken bone, pain
0:48 greetings from low-opacity Ham
I broke my bone when I was 4
He teth Adam
During  the time 1:01 when it talks about funny bones funny bones aren't bones it's actually a nerve and when you hit there it is the nerve rubbing against the bone
The pipe kills funny bones 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm only 7 years old stop putting violence inside your videos
Oh my God he said the S word
🥺 👉👈
same thing when I was 5 my cousin hit me with a plastic duck  and it gave me a big cut on my head and it was bleeding and I started to cry in fear.
I remember that one time I broke a bone while leaving a pool. My teeth, to be precise.
From Illinois and I can say I have more scars than a chopping board
The Lego 🤣🤣🤣🤣

I love the part where he talks about hitting the fan
Brysons famous speech: “I’m loosing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful, if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so that I can continue this mortal Journey rather than ending it prematurely, due to loss of blood.” - Bryson
Here is a lesson you need to know in your life: you gotta have pain at one point
hamanimations:On second thought why not remove all the bones in the human body cant Break what isent there  Me:”rips out all bones” CaNt BrEaK WhAt IsEnT tHeRe “Proceds to slid in to the drain”
Rip Bryson 0:16
I broke my arm before
Hi
You said so fast in to sentences
I have a staple wood chip and pencil lead inside me and I also got a cut from my knee to my foot on the back of my leg and this is not even a bit of it:/
Bryson: I have endured a lot of physical pain. Me: and lets not start on the mental...
How did your parents know that you have a bald spot even though they can't find the bald spot?
I never broken a bone before😅😂🎉
I love it how he beats the livening out of somebody
I'm due to have another serious accident any day now. I'm eleven years old and will turn twelve in three months. The last (and first) time I had a serious accident was when I was about eight years old. I had just learned how to ride a bike and was going downhill for the first time. At the end of the hill, I wanted to stop, so I put my foot on the ground. Long story short, I went flying. I screamed for help, and the nearest person ran toward me. Once I got home, my mom told me to take a shower to clean the wound. It hurt a lot. When I was done, my mom put a bandage on it. I had it for a few days, then had a scab, which turned into a bruise. Eventually I was all healed, and now here I am posting a comment about it.
Your funny
Jghyhh
If u have no funny bone then u can't rotate your arm :/
So pain full man
I love how the title is just pain
Once I  fell on my foot and felt like it was broke ughhhh I cried so much
I have pain 💔 😫 😢 😩 😞 😭
3:16  The same thing happened to me when I was about three years old. My sister and I were playing chasies up and down the hallway. I was 'it', and my sister ran into the bathroom (which was den) And right as she was closing the door, my curious little mind was like, "what would happen if stuck my weakest finger in there?" Yup, didn't end well. I ended up having to go to the hospital which I was extremely calm about apparently, and I remember wondering why everyone was making such a fuss. I still don't make a big deal when I'm injured - maybe its something I grew up with..? 🐈
ouuuchhhh
This world shall know pain. -Haminations
Bryson come hurt me I dare ya
“But Bryson, I've never been injured before” Me: “And I've been hurt a lot, physically and mentally”
2:41 this part got me dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:00 i hereby vote for the removal of funny bones from the human body 2:09 i’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that i can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood. 4:54 insert a really out of place sponsorship segway 5:09 S h e  i s n t  c o m i n g  b a c k  b u d d y

Here’s a story from me. One time my dad told me to come to his office so to save time I ran down the hall.little did I know the garbage bag was right in range of my right toes.and there’s was broken glass at the bottom.When I scraped I said it was fine however I was bleeding on the floor. A LOT. My dad panicked since he was on a call.but luckily my uncle gave advice on the phone before he came over with his first aid kit. Then I was rushed to hospital on my iPad. Obviously. But then the put the freeze in me and I screamed. Then the put stitches in my toe and now I have a cool scar on my toe.HAHA PAIN TICKLES
Mine accident was way more painful  It happened when I was 9(still 9) Me my father older and little brother were riding on our bike's and as me my brothers and my dad were riding down a hill a old man was walking with his bike and I got scared that I couldn't turn right and I was riding down super fast that I fell that I broke my tooth in half and I was in so much pain that I cried. sad pain story🥲.the end

I remember chasing my cat when I was 5 years old or something and when I was little did I know I tripped on something but I forgot what it was. As I was tumbling I smash my head into a door frame. And i hit my fore head on the corner of the door frame. But somehow it didn’t do much damage my head kinda had a little dent and that was all. And the fall I took it felt pretty fast.

When I was 3, my dad was sledding and he sat me on his lap. The snow pushed us down the wrong way and my face slammed against a fence. I had my face stitched up but they didn’t realize it caused brain damage. This triggered epilepsy and I was just recently cleared from it.
Funny bone 0:49
4:33 same but for a different reason. i was hitting something with a shovel i beleive at the age of 7 it bounced back and hit me straight on the eyebrow. the scar is cool, worth it lol.

I have been in pain in my knee and it was so much pain
I feel like Bryson is the unfortunate person in a family.
I did the same with the door hinge except I also did it with my car when I was eight years old I had a car that close with the click of a button but when my mom clicked the button and shut my hand on it and I have this big bruise on my finger and doll so somehow I can put my fingers in a spot that it’s not supposed to be in and the door hinge I did the same
You’re not the only one who experienced high great level of pain, I broke all my bones when I was only five years old and when I was eight years old I got a hole dug into my skin that was showing my muscle tissue and trust me I was bleeding a lot

Bryson hit this cactos which represents pain many times -> 🌵
I love the way he says the funny bone is a bone but really it is a nerve in your body located at the bottom of your elbow and that nerve connects to the nerves in your hand making you fingers unable to move so if yalls peanut brains didn't understand that well YOU DUMB
But I  have  still  experienced  physical  pain  ........ Death

My brother broke a bone before
One time i was messing around with my younger brother.(Keep in mind there was a metal pipe infront of me) We were throwing empty bottles at eachother, when i dove down to avoid the bottle i hit that pipe leaving a huge gash on my eyebrow, and after 1 second i fell down and cryed so hard that i couldnt breath for 3 seconds, and i ended up getting 2 stiches i think, THE END.  Sorry if i made any Grammar mistakes.

One of my worst injuries was when I was in primary school and I was sitting on a lunchroom bench and I didn’t notice at I was leaning backward, and at some point I was bending backward (for some reason) and as soon as I did that I fell backwards straight onto my head. I’m lucky I didn’t black out and I went to the nurse, got an ice pack, and decided never to speak about it. Now I’ve shared it. To hundreds of people.

Hi
I have broken a bone and let me tell you it was paiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin  fullllllllllllllll
I am here to send a message about Hod and how he created us you may not reamember him but he reamembers you pls believe in him you don’t have to if you don’t want to great video :)
Ima talk about pain so one I was about 7 years old and my mom, dad, brother, and sister were in Dominican in a pool. The pool had a little standing area in the middle of the pool for people the stand at. So my brother was on the standing area and I was going to get on. But of course the floor was wet and my brother fell hittting my head, but *most importantly* my front teeth hit the ground as my brother landed at me. After that my two front teeth were cut in half and worst of all they already fell out (you know where I’m going with this). So my parents send me into the dentist a few months later to put in fake teeth in (no not gold material or silver) and my teeth went downhill since then. This next one was when I was 6 and this is the pain *YOU HATE ALOT.* So we were a baseball stadium because my dad used to play in the mlb (Most know to play with the Giants) and I wanted to get on my babysitter shoulder, and when I mean that I mean the WHOLE BODY. So there we were with me on my babysitter’s shoulder seeing people hit, but then my body went backwards and fell bout the the floor *head first* and guess what the material the floor was made of? *C O N C R E T E.* And of course I start crying idk how loud but I think it was LOUD. And we went straight to the hospital and miss the game and I throw up 2,763 times (joke). Since then my hair and the exact same spot had a little bald spot and my hair would mess up when I don’t brush it. At this point I have no idea how I’m still alive since I have more injuries like these but thank god I’m still alive and continuing live on this journey with you guys. Thank you reading these story’s and peace! ✌🏽
I can do the scorpion no problem and it doesn’t hurt my😶

1:51  kinda the same thing happend to be but a little less intense,soi had a bunk that had stairs, so i was running around the house and i diecided to run up the stairs rather than walk up, so i ran up and halfway i tripped on the stairs and  i hit my forehead on my eyebrow on the RIM of the stair, and to this day i have this scar under my eyebrow.
Wow go
4:15 did not ask
New Title: I Almost Got Traumatized (3 Times)
AaaaaaAaaaaaaaaaa
I don't think this is such a smart idea
What was the most painful moment of my life: I had an infection, so my parents took me to the doctor. The doctor cut a line in my waist and took an organ out, and they put the juicy thingy on me, when I woke up I scream in pain and my mom told me to try sleep, after sleeping 10× times the line in my waist wasn't hurting that much but... now the line is just a dark brown line.
My current memory pain is: tripping and cracking my head open on a concrete globe(I was three), sprained my ankles 3 times and tweaked one aswel, I fractured my toe doing a backflip, jammed three fingers, I fell and cut my back on a indoor power box at school(I was 7). I'm glad I don't remember cracking my head open but now I have a pcool scar on my forehead now.
,with ma boi Bryson
I wanna make a vid
I broke my arm at 3 so thats cap

One time when I was playing with my grandpa I didn’t realize that the floor in the garage was wet so I ran as fast as I could to get the ball that was in the garage and then I slipped and then I fell and then I twisted my leg but then then my mom called the ambulance because she thought that my leg was broken but surprisingly I found out that my leg was actually twisted thank God

I broke a bone of my arm
I just fel down the stairs
my thumb gut shut in the bathroom door before and it hurt so bad i think thats why its more pink
i've hurt my left ankle many times by standing too fast and jumping down stairs
I had a Seizure
I had 3 pains on the same leg
i havn’t ever broken a bone, but one night, when i was in first grade, the power went out. my smooth brain, child self, thought “im going to go to my parents room in the dark void that is the hallway”. so, when i got their my parents, of course, told me to go back to bed. so, on the night stand by the door to the hallway, their was this metal fan that was shaped like a cat, with *really* long whiskers. my child self thought it would be a good idea to run back to my room, and as it was pitch black, i ran into the fan. the whisker of this cat fan punctured my eyelid, and i went to the emergency room. i dont *think* it damaged my eye, but i have glasses now, soooooo… moral of the story, don’t run in the dark
I saw a cool gap between the door and my aunt closed her door because she finished a shower. And my thumb nail came off
So this actually is kinda the same story that happened to me
I broke the tip on my finger and there’s a lot of / *nerve endings* / that haurt and it felt like I as dying
lol he’s funny
i broken my arm befor when i was 6 or 5 and i went up stairs and i fell down and it was like AHHHHH  so thats how i broken it

Here’s a story to the legend himself, Bryson…  I also have a pain story… During P.E. when me and my friend where waiting on the couch mu friend didn’t realy think and he just sat on my back. To this day I still have pain on my back… Maybe also because some little girl decided to throw a brick at my back.
I broke a bone once it was my right hand
i don't know what is the pain of breaking a bone but i have broken 2 bones when i didn't remember anything so yeah also i'm fully recovered
But Bryson I've never been injured before! Bryson: we can fix that!
I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and I would be grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to heal the wounds so that I can continue  this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.

Pain Is The Only Thing That Cultures Life Maybe There's A Way I Can Take Away Pain And Then Leave People With No Bones Which Means No Pain At All Life Will Be Better This Way...
One time my fingers were in a school door and this buff ass janitor goes to close it and he’s like why won’t this door close. I tried to tell him to stop but he’s still breaking my fingers to close the door lol. And it took until my fingers were purple and black for him to realize lol
POV:Bryson surviving a 3,000ft fall from a Mountain
The fact that in every video there’s either a ahhhhhhhhhhh war a goes like crack

The part when you fall off the cliff was funny 😆
“So they put me in a gray jacket and I screamed. STOP TOUCHING ME STOP TOUCHING ME DO U EVEN. HEAR ME STOP TOUCHING ME”
He isn’t stupid he has just suffered severe brain damage over the years
The funny bone isn't a bone
Lol
My worst pain was a bit of a doozy. Basically to summarize: I tried to jump from a sidewalk to a thing my friend was on, completely missed, slipped on what I can only assume to be a wet leaf, and absolutely ram my head into the sidewalk behind me.
The STOP TOUCHING ME! made me laugh for
Hotdog
2:23 when you lose in the final round in a game

When I was 8 I was in a vacation I was sleeping i mom carried me next to the bed I fell and I got cut in my head cuz of the glass

If you are friends with me you will constantly know how much i say “ow.” I am known for hurting myself ALL the time. I cant go a day without hurting myself.
Lol 😂😂
Bryson:on second thought why not remove all bones cant break what isn't there. The scene after Bryson said that Me:dying laughing

Breaking a bone doesn’t hurt as bad as u think btw
I also have a scar across my eyebrow from the corner of my hallway
You weird
One time I was at my friend's house and we were on the top bunk, and she went to get down but the ladder broke, and then, my heart stopped as I saw her falling and landing straight on her face. She said she was fine, but God I was so scared
That’s hurt

Mom? Yes honey? I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver guardian, would transport me to the hospital, help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood. (That got me laughing in my head)
I never broken a bone before
When I was a kid I hurt myself too many times yeah that hurt and I hurt myself on the table with my head and I didn't lose anybody was a boo-boo

the one where he said his brother sounds annoyed that actually happened one time to my Matthew the door closed and if you look at one of his pinkies you can see a scar because his nail actually fell off and The top of his pinky fell off of his finger had to be stitched back on
His pain is true I hit my eye with a key
For eight year olds who don’t know what climax means it means like end of conversation or agreement or given a chance even if the person has grudges
Bryson did you know that that you're funny bone isn't really a bone it's just a group of nerves and that's why it hurts so much when you hit it on something?
When I was younger I fell face first into pavement and then got up, took a deep breath then noticed my lashes were wet. I reached my hand up and touched my head then pulled my hand down and it looked like I had just murdered someone. I started crying even though it didn’t hurt because I felt like I was suppose to be crying💀
bro getting vecnad
When you said remove all bones you won't be able to run though and also I've been in pain like bajillion times

I once got a really bad stomachache and had to be taken to the hospital because the pain was unbearable and because of the stomachache I would puke whenever I ate something and when I had to poop I would poop red liquid.

0:13 botw link except he doesn’t get hurt , just eats apples and goes on with his day         also i got hurt at school once, where i was playing with one of my classmates, and then this blind bitch hit me on my mouth so hard with her elbow that i rushed to my teacher to give me the pass to get inside the school building, and then i was running to the nurse’s office while staining my favorite jacket with my blood flowing out my mouth (i didn’t leave a trail) and once i got into the nurse’s office she was gonna clean my wound and i didn’t let her (come on i was in elementary school) so she just cleaned it with a napkin and then gave me a fucking ice pack (just reminding you, my classmate hit me so hard on my top lip my top gum was also bleeding)  and i still haven’t accepted her apology
another time my sister kept pinching me on my arm so i had to throw her at a spike 😃
this is a time i felt very annoying pain i was on vacation the waves were VERY VERY strong but because i didnt notice i got stung by a wasp or maybe bee and jellyfish i kept itching
Fun fact: When I was 5 I got scarlet fever and was always getting The wrong medicine so it was hospital visits everyday. Until they has to draw blood to get a sample to figure out I had scarlet fever and give the correct meds

Your funny bone is actually a nerve controlling your fourth and fifth finger.   That doesn't make me hate my funny bone any less. IT HURTS

Finger one was almost the exact same as my sister got her finger chopped off like no joke but that was at day care (just letting you know that I do not go to day care thank you bye)
Funny bones aren't bones there nerves
One time I went down a slide with a ski pole...

I saved bryson at the beginning by flipping my phone upside down so he can ascend.
Ok so that actually happened to me once the door hit my finger and what even worse I was at school :c
evrytime in his video's he gets hit withthe angry german kid getting beat up.
"Imma tired :>"         -bryson.

I want to see a movie that has so much violence that I will literally almost barf
Sorry about your pain but have a good day keep the good work
The same thing happened to me. When I was a kid in kindergarten I hit my forehead on the corner of the closet they had to sew my forehead, but I got a scar like Harry Potter.
Once me and my sisters were being chased by a bee we ran inside our house but they slammed the door while my fingers where there and then the bee stung my finger
I just love these
im surprised that this 20 year old doesn't know the funny bone is actually a nerve
iloev
Imagine watching this at the library
I wonder if Bryson is immortal because he dies then he comes back
2:08
Hey Bryson... I cut my forehead open lol.
I’ve fell on my forehead on the road
Dude u lucky u did not break ur bone since I did and sheeeeeeesh it annoyed me the entire month when writing...
Haminations i rolled down the stairs on my head and i landed on my head and i broke a arm
My brother watches you're videos I wake up you're on tv I walk in  you 're on tv      😄😃 😅

"Mooooom! I'm loosing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian, would transport me to the hospital to help, heal the wound, so that i can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it pretty much early due to loss of blood" this line killed me XD
My bones are unbreakable cause i got hit by a metal swing going at 25 mph
3:41 I almost broke my arm on a trampoline ON SPRING BREAK
One time I fell through a window and cut my artery in my right arm      Edit:that's only one of my near death experiences I've had 5 near death experiences
i broken my leg before
Actually the funny bone is not a bone it’s nerves
The funny bone part happened to me to but my chair

My x girlfriend came back 7 days ago                 Jk she left 7 days ago :(

When I was like 1 or 2 my dad brought me to my grandparents house and I was learning how to walk and for some reason I was walking around naked in their garden and there was this big nettle Bush and my dad was watching me run around and I trip and fall into the Bush and all my dad sees or heard is a little voice saying " me otay me brave girl" and a little thumbs up from the ditch and when I got out of the Bush my bum looked like a tomato
They did what!!!!!!! 4:21

I like that Bryson didn't name this video like "My Traumas" but just "Pain"
once my nephew jumped off his bunkbed and his face slammed right into a cup am 3 inch 1foot long scar
HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD YET?!?!
The funny bone is not a bone
Bro vs bro vs bro vs dad vs mon
"you can't break what isn't there" I find this funny in many ways I can't explain
"Although, I Never Broken a bone though"  "Wow, Brysen You Never Broken a bone?, Your pain is irrevalent You Stupid Idiot-" *Brysen Hits Him In all Parts of the body* "Although, Id Never Broken a bone I Still Experience The Revelange OF PSYCKAL PAIN"
That’s painful ofc.
I remember when I was on the playground when I was 11 I went us as high as I could and slipped I was about 7 feet In the air when I hit the mulch I started screaming like I was dying it was drama lol
I always get a cracked bone bruh I have 4 bruises
Me: I'm going replace your brain with a bomb Bryson: "AHHHHHHH AAHHHHHHRHHHHH" (Sound effects) : BBBSSHHHHHHHHH Me: ... He's just tired
Whoelse thought there wifi was bad in the begining?
Your videos are the best
1:36  What is this sound effect from?
The1st time I watch this it was hilarious
Cringe story: One of the reasons why I got rushed to the ER: so I was at school I’m at the other playground there’s a slide with two ways so I decided to go to the middle because it was low wall there so I sat down and then boom one of my 🎾s went numb
This is my dad's daughter and I get hurt a lot and by the way I got a paper with all of my bloods in it like every time when I get hurt it it says how many times I bleeded and my 1st one didn't turn out well but my blood is on the paper and it's still there and by the way I never knew blood turns Brown when it gets too old GROSS! and by the way do people do this like remember their blood like when they get hurt and put it on piece of paper and they're kind of like I'll never forget that blood yeah OK do it now or else just kidding just kidding Or am I...
Why did he not die in the into
Do you call Mom and then scream or do you just screem
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Hey kids don't you mean put Bryson like never died before
Guess that bald spot isn't hereafter all
He's not the only one who almost died 1 my head got freaking hit with an anvil and I was one second away from dieing but I've made because I'm not going to say it because it involves my crush finishing the second anyways I almost died but at the last second...
I can relate

I HAVE broken a bone. The top of my arm below my wrist. I did it at school and I got an ice pack, though I almost fainted. Anyway, I later found out that 3 days later, I went to the hospital and got an x-ray. It was traumatic. I’m STILL dumb and it STILL HURTS. UwU
“WOW BRYSON YOU’VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE?!”  Bryson: SHUT YOUR STUPID MOUTH BEFORE I MAKE U   they keep going   Bryson: alr you have chosen death.. MURDER✨🤡

Me: "has not broke a single bone or got stung by a bee"
His "how to animate" was like a robot lol

Pause at 2:43 lol
True funny bones are bad i hitted mine so I know how it feels

Bryson Doesnt Die ]And use buut to attack Lol
The funny bone is not a bone it’s a nerve
0:13 what it feels like when you fall down the stairs
For me it was like this : Chtistmas Eve, I had juice and went in my big sisters room to see the fireworks in the dark I spilled orange juice i slipped and i fell between the wooden bar of the bed and broke my tailbone
>:(
I have so many scars but I never broke a bone (82 scars) 😅
Omg i love pain pain is the best
“So is that why people think my head is a ice cream cone mommy?”
One time while I was playing outside the house i Died
I agree
BUT
"I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver guardian would transport me to the hospital help heal the wound so that i can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to due of loss blood" Got me wheezing
Having the same thing happen with me, a fan, and a bunkbed. Is so odd, It's true you don't feel the pain at first.

Once I fell on my wrist and it cracked. My parents thought it was just a sprain, so I went the whole weekend with a broken wrist before I went to a series of doctors on the following Monday. First, my pediatrician, then we had to drive to a whole other county to go to a hospital to get it x-rayed and casted.
You might not have this bald spot, unless you had really good hair care growing up. Then it might’ve just grown back lol
I know it’s a joke…. But we wouldn’t even be able to move or keep a good form if we had no bones….. soooo, it’s not really funny. Pretty much every single organ you have including your brain would move around, and wouldn’t be kept safe and secure by those bones. Like, maybe you’d have skins recognizable human like shape, but you will not live long.
Happy childhood = more pain boring childhood = less pain
I never knew someone who was so much like me Mind:DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES AND MAKE THEM SUFFER IN EVERYWAY TAKE THEM HELL AND BACK FOR THERE SINS ARE UNFORGIVABLE
Pain hurts

"Sop touching me stop touching me, do you speak english!!!!!!!!?" "Then they hit me with that good sleep juice, I'm a tired" "You wanna get your ex girlfriend back? Too bad, She isn't coming back buddy"
I also have stiches on my eye brow
That time when I was in 3rd grade in gym I was playing crossover then I ran as fast I can then I got injured
1 time I was playing with my cousin with a walking cane and I beat my eye on a sided a dining table trust me I felt your pain
If I felt pain, I will immediately die in pain, just like Bryson, I sometimes felt time so many much, I'm even double-jointed, so I can do that cross legs thing, I fell so sorry for Bryson, maybe u should add a death counter
Can you do a jurassic world video
I've never broken a bone either   Edit:I need suggestions for a good time to become a youtuber
I saw the bed one on shorts
And that’s because I am protected alot
Bro you get hurt like me kinda accept I only get cuts,scratches and scars and I’ve never broken a bone before but the only thing I experience is paiiiiiinnnnnn

Funny but not
One time in July 4th 2019 my mom was using a sparkler and it hit my left eyebrow and also at the same time I lost my hearing for a second before recovering maybe due to a firework going off and thats the story on how I almost gone deaf and almost lost an eye
In first grade a girl fell and got a scrap but she had never had one beffor so she was in tears but I helped her (Also I got a cut from falling and a rock litterly cutted me and we were at a park and there was no medacal kit so we had to come home) also a 3 year old elbowed me in the nose on a tramapilen during a block party
I like this video
My sister hit my funny bone with her ipad

The same thing kinda happened to me, one time I was just leaving the bathroom after my sister was rushing me and usually I have a habit of just putting my finger in the hinges when I  leave and I still do, this time she wasn’t looking and so she slammed the door……  ON MY FINGERS! it hurt like an ass.

One time at softball practice, I practiced batting, but my helmet didn't have a face mask on and one of the girls were pitching. She threw the ball, I moved to the side, the ball hit my bat and flew up right into my helmet and hit me right in the mouth. I was losing blood everywhere and had to sit out the whole practice. It was pretty bad... my parents didn't even bring me to a DOCTOR'S office and this was 2 months ago. The upper left section of my lip still has a little swelling in it. IT STILL HUURRRRRRRRRTZ
I've done this before XD 1:12

Oh the funny bone one, I feel that almost all the time oh and I also actually broke my jaw but it didn’t hurt at all, I am so confused it was in a car crash so it should have hurt but I guess since I was asleep I didn't?

When I was 7 I had ice skating lessons. in one of my lessons I fell onto the ice headfirst and my Chin bone split in half. And we didn't have to go to the hospital because.- Mom is a healthcare person? Surprisingly nothing was broken.
Bryson the funny bone is actually a nerve
Okay so I don’t think I’ve ever broke the bone before minus the surgery’s where the doctors did it but it was to help me walk but anyway I’ve never broke Sumter accidents
I had a scar next to my mouth it’s like next to my chin but not really next to my chin

my worst pain was when I was a toddle my sister ripped 4 of my teeth OUT for her gc video like what
Knock knock who’s there tree, no one, tree’s not here. Knock knock who’s there tree, who? Tree, who? OOOOOLLL (Now the tree is falling over, the joke doesn’t work anymore). “Look buddy, that was clever and funny, but that’s not really something we’re doing right now,” the PPTTJ will say, “that’s something for an old college friend’s movie.” This is called concept rejection. This is a common problem and it is often the first stumbling block in any potential video marketing plan.  Now what?  This can be a difficult hurdle to clear. The PPTTJ is willing to discuss your content idea, but will be more interested in your existing product or service (the real audience). Here are some questions that can help determine whether you are right for each other:  What is your industry and what is the positioning of your product or service?  Who are your competitors?

I have also a scar over my eyebrow because when I was like 5 I was about to jump like superman into my bed. But my 5 year old stupid brain said "You should jump into that thing out of metal beside your bed". And so I did. I am now a 9 year old Swedish guy with a scar.

So there was this one time when I was with my little sister in the room that we usually play in. However, not anymore :( OKAY ANYWAY, We had a couch that can turn into a bed, and we tried to do that. However, there was a part where we had to go behind the couch, and the wall was right behind me so I had to squeeze through, and in the middle of squeezing through, there were sharp thingys on the bottom that hit my leg hard and I was SCREAMING in pain. There was this another time where I was running and playing tag in the dark night with my brother, and I didn't see a pole coming. So, I slammed by head into the pole and fell down. There was a huge scar on my face from my lips to my eyes. Yeah, that big! The scar was there for months. When my brother told everyone that I was injured, he said it was in a "FUnYNY WaY" so everyone laughed and I was SOOOOO ANNNOOYOYYYEEEDDDDDD…..
It's 3:23 am at night I'm tired
Did no one noticed that he squashed the guy at the beginning with his but?

I guess our child hoods are similar I got hurt in similar ways Like fingers getting slammed on by door because I put my fingers in, fracturing a finger by falling over and it bent over, bleeding from my head because I tried to run infront of a bike and it ended badly (I was dumb), and hurting myself in many other ways. My most recent bad injury was when I stepped in a tiny hole last year, and sprained my ankle. Tried to walk the whole day on it at school and after that it got so bad I couldn't walk at all for a week.
I slammed my thumb into a metal fence at Mach 10 on a motorbike… but since I’m young, it didn’t break so that’s fun
there was a time were I hit my head on a table and opened it up another time where i could have fuckin died, i could have fallen FROM A ROLLER COASTER. I had no seatbelt, it was broken, so I grabbed the edges hard as HELL
"Or else you might shape there head into a cone like this"  me:"is that what happened to finis and pherb

I’m worded I have crewed my back by doing a handstand
Here it comes😃👊
really wish that branch that my day care friend moved away that ended up striking my face gave me a cool scar :(
One time in October I got into a car crash and had to get my foot in a cast for over a month, my school also had numerous floors and I had to get to different classes on different floors, and since the school knew there was definitely going to be numerous kids with casts, they had and elevator where anyone with trouble walking down the stairs could go and ask for one, but you see, I’m in middle school and I’m extremely embarrassed about everything I do, so for the whole time I had a cast on, I was limping down the stairs, I think I got the cast off in January, so I was suffering
Bro I Experience really bad pain every day because for some reason I walk on the outside of my foot and so I twist my ankle a lot I’m surprised I haven’t broken it yet this has been happening for like 12 I’m 14 I had 2 years of no pain but of course I was stupid so I fell a lot yay for me 😑
I broke my color one the day I first watched this
speaking of injuries one time i went to a store and my feet was too close to the door and i opened it and the door scraped off a whole bunch of skin off my big toe and my god I know what being skinned feels like now
This video is so wholesome.
I wanna bond with dad like you did LOL
The 'Cool scar across eyebrow' hit me hard because i have one from my brother throwing a captain america shield at me when i was like.. 6. He was 9 and definitely did not even know what medieval meant but he still claims to this day that it was a medieval shield. hes dum

Bryson I haven't broken a bone and I've been injured
The funny bone isn't a bone it's a nerve that's close to a bone
One day I was losing blood on my head and my belly and my leg
Hi
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Lol
The random meme screaming had me on the floor in this one 😂
That was like me when I had to get stitches when I was three. I was super strong and it took like three people to hold me down.
by the way i am a girl
So when you fell down and hit your head on the snowboard, I can do that without hurting
My brother hit me yesterday in the cheek/face It is blue
It's funny at the same time
hey Bryson i get hurt all the time! yaay!! "everything hurt's now yaay!" i,m crazy
hahahahahahahahaha
Got this in my recommendations and I will share a couple experiences of injury I recall from my youth. Both were back in my elementary school days. The first happened one day when I rushed into the back room of our house. I slipped on the rug that was put after the step from the kitchen to that room and then fell right down onto the ankle of the foot that didn't slip. Surprisingly there was no visible damage. In fact there was no pain at all as I had no feeling in that foot until around midnight. When all the agonizing pain hit me at once. Went to the doctor and found out I had bruised the bone of my ankle which to this day I question how that also didn't bruise my skin.  Anyway the second instance of pain was another one that didn't come with initial pain. I was walking back home from school, it was a long walk as I had to transfer from the closer one for....reasons. Anyway as I walked a rather nice old woman drove up next to me and asked how I was walking. This lead to confusion until I looked down at my foot and saw a long piece of wood sticking about an inch into the flesh of my calf just a bit above my ankle. Then like an idiot...I pulled it out. After which came pain but then a nice ride home with the nice old lady whom didn't even reprimand me for the stupidity I was already hating myself for. Luckily apart from some bleeding there was no issues as the result of this. Save for me paying more attention to where I'm stepping.
I've had a wide range of pain
Ar you ok

My worst injury is when my sister showed me that she can do a flip on the swing then I was like…cool then I got on the swing but there was mud on the ground then I flipped then……….I fell upside down splat I fell in the mud *me AHHHHHHHH*

1:57 bro hurry up and grab ur coins before they disappear
I broke a bone before and I’m 8
cute
When you jumped off the bunkbed and felt to check the damage and saw blood, I feel your pain as last year during the summer: I was playing on my Nintendo Switch grinding a game with it charging. It unplugged from the outlet so I was putting it back in and hit my head on the corner of my desk to check the damage and all I saw was blood. It created a big gash for about a month and then healed and created a scar on my hairline.
Insert a really out of place sponsor shareway
Bryson got slowed down while saying: "physical pain."
Here's the worst pain I felt: falling off my 3rd story bunk bed head first while I'm aslewp
Me and remembering the time I was in kindergarten and I tripped over a ball my homey was bloody I can’t believe this school didn’t Send me to the hospital

STOP TOUCHING ME
Fun time when I was very little I almost have to go to the hospital it was like this me and my older cousin we were playing by the bathroom door and she run into the bathroom very fast and I tried to lock her in but  when I did that I got my head bashed on the doorknob of the bathroom and my left eyebrow was bleeding blood like crazy, I had to get three layers of stitches stitches, glue, and  clear tape ,it was horrible I was crying the whole entire time. And when me and my dad finally took all those layers my eyebrow half of it now looks like I have a unibrow and half of my left eyebrow is gone. I have been scarred from this day. And even though I'm a girl now that I have a unibrow I look like a boy in that way I think I look ugly

Imortle
Funny bones makes me feel not hurt but hard to get up
That sounds painful.
4:42 much better
4:39
Funny bones actually are good, They let your brain know of the feeling of your fifth and or fourth fingers. I think...
I once also put my fingers in the door but my dad shut the door also i think i broke something
OMG I hate pain soooooo much sometimes my back will hurt at a random time!
😣
The finger thing has happened to me before I actually did it on purpose since I was like 7 at the time I didn’t go to the hospital since I didn’t tell my parents or grandparents and my fingers on my right hand where fine after like 2 months after like 1 day I waited for it to heal and the next day and the next day and onward until it eventually healed but I did cry a bit the same day I got my fingers squished by the door since I thought my fingers would never move but I still didn’t tell my parents since I was in my room crying but I was fine in the end.
If the pole was going Mach 10 (7,672.69 MPH), it’d break your funny bone and might’ve even cut your arm off.
Pain! You break me down you vuild me up beileiver beileiver
Brodie with slaming the door B like "Alright as hard as I can "

You draw yourself young with ears but when you draw everybody else they don’t have any ears
“I’m losing blood at a alarming rate and most grateful if you my caregiver transports me to the hospital to heal the wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood”

BONK.
When I was younger, maybe 6 or 7, I was grabbing something from the restroom for my mom before church. My mom had just straightened her hair so her straightener was still on. I still hadn’t put my socks and shoes on either. While I was grabbing the item from the sink, I stepped on her straightener- I screamed so loud I think our landlord heard us. What had happened was my brother knocked the straightener off the counter and me, being the idiot I am, stepped on it.   Also when I was 10 I got dared to jump off a balcony. I did it and didn’t break a bone surprisingly. I did sprain my wrist but that was all.     I was a stupid child.

44,794th comment lol
1:36 i can hear agk destroying his keyboard
2:23 DRUAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Not trying to be a smarty pants but- (I think) if you removed all bones from your body you would die from loss of blood because your bones create blood cells with a spongey material, and no blood cells mean no blood. And no life!
I fell and hit my head yesterday day and my started bleeding and now I have staples in the back of my head
Bryson: I vote 4 the removal of funny bones 🦴 from the human body. Me: he does know the ✌️ funny bone ✌️ is a nerve right?
I love it that every time he hurts someone he does the but crack one I'm laghing so hard😂😂😂
What the heck you have four fingers
just today my chair fell on my back bc i was tipping in my chair and i tried to get it back onto the ground but then since its one of those fold up medal chairs it folded up WHILE MY FINGERS WERE STILL ON THE CHAIR! then they squished my finger really I MEAN REALLY hard. i had a dent in my finger that looked all bruised and right now where the dent was is not all swelled up and it burns :'D
The funny bone isn’t a bone it’s actually a nerve…
I got fucking stung by a fucking Bee one day
😳wtf xarrn Barry mccn Mnccn nonnN nrpok
How do you anime
Bryson I been injured for 5 or 4 on my knees
This pretty goog👍👍
hey bryson can you give me a hoooyaaaaa
"my heart start to beating fast"
Getting stabbed in your head count as breaking a bone because one time when I was like one or two one of my sisters other brother he wasn't related to me but he grabbed a knife and stabbed in my head he was four or five and everyone was outside and I went to the ER and if you know where it is you can find it it is feeding away
But Bryson there a few times where I got injured like getting my fingers jammed in the door or falling down and sometimes scraping my knee on the concrete and when I loose a tooth it would start BLEEDING (Meme scream) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! No it wasn’t that bad but it did scare me really bad and all that
HOLY COW
ooooh I hope that is not real
Time To Remind Him Of Who's In Charge 1:34

I’m watching this with a small break in my elbow
i love the logic if somebodi says no kill them
That happened to me when I ran and let myself go forward and yeah my spine hurt after that 1:20
Its not the bone its the ultran nerve
If u get hurt it will a little bit and just move on like what I say if they get hurt (the pain is just a weakness and if u control that weakness it will be your strength) like example ur mom hit u as a kid and when u are a adult and your mom hit u U will catch it (if u react fast enough)
what is the name of Brysons yootooz video I want to watch it
I like this because it's very funny and makes me laugh so hard and this is my favorite YouTuber

I AM YOUR FATHER
Once I was 4 years old and I fell out of my moms car and I hit both my knees on the rough, rock road. Both the gashes were big and were only blood. Didn't see my bones. Luckily I'm now 8 years old and have too many cats 👍

ive dislocated my leg 7 times in the past half year
I didn't realize it was suppose to hurt when u do this cause it doesn't hurt at all when i do it? (1:18)

I like  when  you  fell off  the cliff
I was still s trampoline park recently and I jumped off the spleef thing and dived and my back folded like a chair
I just love how Hamition is always so calm even when dying
I fell off a bunk bead too! I was being a kid and trying to hit a balloon, leaning over my the bed. I went too far over the edge and I fell head first into a box full of this hard Toy Story toys. I remember that very vividly. I also bruised my toe twice, once dropping a Printer on it, one of the heavy duty ones, and from dropping a bowl on it. Never broken a bone though.
the way he got coins out his head lol

This is my favorite YouTuber EVER!
This kid has had it to long I’m gonna show him who’s still in charge
I've been punished a lot in life. The following are my experiences. Kindly lemme know how much each one measures on the pain scales:  - i used to get caned on my bums by my teachers at school with a fat cane - i have been spanked by my mother, aunty, teachers and a few friends with their bare hands - a batchmate of mine during my MBA days had one whacked me on my bum with her umbrella (for teasing her) - many doctors and nurses have given my bums injections
The real feeling of pain is when you realize he only has 4 fingers
The door and the finger has happened to me.
U got my childhood back
Let me get straight to the point I remember when I was 8 me and my family were going to a hardware store and so we got out of the car and when I got out of the car I put my fingers in the door hinges and when my grandma closed the door the door of course hit my hand and I cannot explain this more it hurt so bad that I shouted so loud outside the hardware store it hurt for an hour but then the pain went away my fingers were not broken luckily so yeah that’s the end of the story it still hurt pretty hard tho
[me] i sould trow this rod for a dum reason haha [rod] not today kid [me] crap ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?

Once when I was four after school we went to Walter Baker and we were playing baseball I had to run and my big brother pick me up and started running so I would go faster then he tripped over a ball and I fell face-first and my blood is bleeding so hard I got a blue popsicle the end.   Next story so I Bike to School won't and there is a hill that drops down and for some reason there was gravel I was going super fast flipped and slipped and my arm was a bandages for like a week and I did not shower or bathe for that week luckily I've never had a scar B and or any severe injuries like a broken arm
i almost fail out of my chire
i have a scar across my eyebrow
Mr brison us fans is hurt because you killed us many times. Please stop killing ur fans.
I’ve never broken a bone either
I crashed my bike 3 times, i feel pain though... but it didn't bleed. I always noticed what's gonna happen.
When you’re really young still soft and springy that’s why they didn’t break and also that’s why some babies need to wear helmets otherwise you might accidentally sculpt the soft head into a cone

Bryson; I never broke a bone Me: i broke my finger from a door :)
Funny bones are a nerve though,  The funny bone is actually a nerve called the ulnar nerve which controls the feeling in your 4th and 5th fingers and the movement of your wrist, So maybe read or check Wikiped-  Haminations: DONT GET SMART WITH ME
Pain sucks
bryson: on second thought, why not remove all bones? can't break what isnt there. *BECOMES A BLOBFISH*
“I’m a tired 👹👹✨”
If you have no bone you cant stand or move
Karma
I subscribed
I had to go to the hospital like 10 times
I had just like you
One time my whole foot bleeded
Ooo oh my back!
Actually the funny bone is a nerve on your elbow joint.
I'm I'm losing blood at a alarming rate and I would be most grateful if u my caregiver guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the so I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due a loss of blood no I'm just kidding what I actually said was ahhhhhhh!
The pain is hurt!
This video was so funny I laughed so hard🤣🤣
I don’t know how I do it but some how I always stub my toe 4 times a day

The funny bone isn’t a bone, it’s a nerve in your elbow called the ulnar nerve. It hurts so much because it’s really close to your skin

you have not broken a bone, and you are either 19 or 18. I ON THE OTHER HAND, hehe... i was about...9 when i broke my wrist? i had to be either 9, or 8mat the time, and when i had broken my wrist, i was screaming as if i was on a very VERY narrow edge of life and a very high chance of my soul being lifted to heaven. :) i' fine tho, no "MAJOR" injuries from riding a hoverboard, being both, stupid, AND LAZY enough, to go down the curb on this mode of transtport, and malicously get hurt and scream very loud due to a bone being cracked to the point of BREAKAGE. >:)
My head and knee is bruised and my pinky finger is scratched. IT HURTS!!!
0:30 The Scream AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
My friend actually had that happen to her her for head hit the ceiling fan at her friends house and she is now not allowed to go to any sleepovers and I think she still has the scar on her forehead

One time I hit my tendon because my brother RKO me and I thought I broke my hand. And my brother was swinging on a school gate at his school because he was an idiot and it fell on his head ,he couldn't walk for two months and he has a bald spot like you
One time I sprung my hand
I got my hand slammed in a car door once.

Bryson can experience pain in reality but it doesn't hurt him as much,but in animation it shows him in pain but 100× more painful than real life
You don't you don't suck your best YouTuber ever

I've experienced pain many growing up from twisting my ankle to bumping into stuff to biting my own tongue I've experienced it one time me and my Dad were playing baseball and when he thought I was ready to catch it he hit the ball and it hit me in my nose. I had a major nosebleed and my Mom took me to the hospital for an x-ray nothing was broken but I had hurting nose for a days that was back when I was a kid since then I've never into baseball because of the trauma

epok moment :epic:
I have never broken a bone but I did dislocate my small toe on my left foot
One time I was at school and we were about to go to recess and I was playing with my friends chasing them but it had rained last night and I was on ramp running (sounds stupid I know) anyway,I ran down and tripped over my foot and skinned my foot and knee and I was wearing tights  so I carefully tried to peel it off but it just hurt so I grabbed a paper towel and cleaned off the blood but I had lost like 10% percent of my skin  Moral of the story: don’t run after it rains it’s not safe🥲
that moment when u sprain the same ankle 3 time

I love pain
I remember when I was 6 in our house we just to have a *Spiky* wall witch was just paint that dried into little spikes. So my sister who was 16 at the time push me into it.. And when I tried to get you I decided to keep my back on the wall. I think we know what would happen.. *Scrrrraatch* pain and yelling.. Somehow my sister got blamed for my stupidity. My back is fine but it felt like I took my skin off.
the entry is like roblox broken bones 4
He’s the BEEEEEEEEEEEEST
Beginning of the vid. Be like:AHHHHHHHHHH.    Hi I’m Bryson
I hope Bryson dont break my bones
Why you have 4 fingers?🤔
1:57
2:05 haminations being smart
The finger in the door hinge happened to me I broke 4 bones 1 in every one on my fingers on my right arm except my thumb
A dog bit me when I was little
Actually we have pain because of nerves
Same I have a scar on my eyebrow too It happened when  I was a in a tricycle and waiting for my mom to go sit with me too But when she tried to close the umbrella The sharpy thingy on the umbrella slashed my eyebrows, I almost cried but I stopped it and their we go it bleeded and had a scar on my eye
I also scorpion kicked myself and almost cracked my head open
I couldn't stop laughing 🤣
I broke my arm bone.
I relate so much to the whole "well you've never broken a bone, your pain is irrelevant!" shtick, my mother used it a lot along with "You'll never have a baby, so you wouldn't know what true pain is like" my how the turns have tabled.. partialy.  Either way, there is no "true pain" or whatever, pain is pain gosh darn it. Broken bone or simple paper cut it doesn't matter, it freaking hurts so quit this stupid garbage. To the parents out there, or even younger peeps, please stop telling people that are showing signs of being in pain that any form of pain they experience unless it's a broken bone is "stupid" and they need to "get stonger", "deal with it" and "grow up" or whatever. To parents especially, it's your duty to care for you child, if you do stuff like this it honestly just makes them annoyed or reluctant to talk to you about pain they might be experiencing and so they end up holding things in from you, even if it could be a life threatening pain in their chest or something. Look after your kids and don't tell them their nervous system is lying to them, it's there for a reason.
GOD DANG DID U GO THROUGH THAT geez that must of hurt BAD
3:21- that’s happened to me too but instead it wasn’t as bad but it’s pulled my skin up to which when my finger was out it’s stayed like that and unfortunately the skin had to be cut off- (Don’t worry my finger’s fine now :]) ps I didn’t bend any fingers too so that’s good-)
Can you do some animation memes? like Pink elephants meme or somthing :-)
this video is brutal
I have not broken a bone either Bryson. Our pain is relevant ……

And suprisingly NOTHING was broken!🙃 The doctor:😳🦴🦴🦴👍
This video made remember that a melting piece of plastic went like 1 inch away from my eye I am now terrified of fire and  melting stuff
The worst pain I've ever been in was when I got an electric scooter for my birthday so I wanted to try it out and my parents said that them and my sister would go on a hike and that I had to go to my friends house so we were taking turns on it and I wanted an extra long turn bc it was dying(it can go 15 mp) So I went down a hill in my neighborhood and came back up the hill and hit a snake on the road their bodys are surprisingly durable so I got launched forward like an angry bird hit my head got a concussion then slid across the road for 5 seconds it ripped off all my skin so I got off the road bc I didn't get knocked out then I saw someone watch me crash and they got in their car and left so fuck em. Since my parents weren't home I had to go to my friends house I was dizzy as fuck and in incredible pain on the way back and I couldn't walk to his house so I had to use the scooter. When I got there he gave me one of his shirts bc mine was torn to shreds and I threw up on his bed and went to the hospital at 1:46 am because I slept the entire day. I was in so much pain and I still have scars and the lack of brain cells to prove it.
0:48 Greetings.
I have also had a stitch mark on my right eyebrow
Pain be like

Hey stop touching me stop touching me do you speak English stop touching me! Then they hit me with that good stuff I'm a tired

I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and will be most grateful as u, my caregiver, would take to the hospital to continue this mortal journey instead of ending in a prematurely way.    That sound a little like: “Mother, I would be most grateful if u let me consume a pastry of high levels of sugar and simple carbohydrates” from the Odd1’sOut
OMG😂😂😂😂😂 I,m dying
Hi

1 time I was in school and I fell onto the wood of the playground a student came up to me and said the teacher and I said no I'll be fine 10 seconds later the teacher sees me comes to me apparently I busted my knee and there are rocks back and I think there's still one Rock in it PS: this happened like 5 years ago
“Im losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian, would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds, in order to live out this life, rather then ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.”

Your family is like mine
Well my pain is when I was 4 or 5 years old me,my cousin and my dad were driving with my dad's motorcycle then when we were almost at near my house I slipped from the motorcycle and I went flying to the ground until the motorcycle crashed into my head and my right leg I was crying alottttttt so my dad picked me up and went home, after that I was still crying also I was at the back seat sorry I didn't tell you, then my dad tried to wipe it off but the wound was reallllllyyy deep so I had to wait for 5 years until the wound healed. And that's my story of my pain.

Who is that white guy who says wow bryson?
Ive broken my funny bone once and it healed
once, i had an old ipad without a case, and my lil brother threw it at my nose and it bled. and, when i was walking through the garage door, i accidentally got my fingers stuck in the tiny gap, and my lil brother closed it on my pinky. (and i just thought, oh well, the garage door is closed. better open it!)
Right now I'm currently using one arm to type this. My stupid brain thought it was a good Idea to try and do a handstand. On second thought I knew I was so close to doing one. when I tried, I fell on my neck to my shoulder and *waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*  Literally I cannot barly move my other arm now and my mom says "its fine" I think this world is going to end if people don't understand I'm HURT I Neeeeeeed He'LPPP.

"i'm losing blood" what does that mean?
I'm a tired
once when i was 7 i was in one of those playground houses where they have games, parkour, etc. so they had a ball pit too and some shapes in it for decoration (they were rubber) and my 7 year old brain thought "it will be totally epic if i jumped off one" so i climbed up a big triangle, got ready, and stupidly pointed my feet at the ground. ZSXENHJIMK ........................... WWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMOMMEYYYYYY EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  so i ended up with a twisted pinky toe and a bandaid around my entire foot

My worst pain happened time ago i was running with my eyes closed because i was and still am a kid and i hit a pole thing that blocks cars and i fell backwards and broke my head open i still remember everything that happened after luckily the hole wasn't that big and the blood dried and i didn't need stitches
This video Is relatable
Y'know one time I held a staple gun to where my middle and index finger where over the staple area and if you couldn't tell where this is going then. My fingers where stapled together and I didn't feel any thing... for the first two seconds.
I stub my toe a lot of times
When I was 9 or 10, my dad had rented a lime electric scooter and just before returning it, he asked me and my sister if we wanted to try, my sister said no but I said yes, we went into the driveway and I couldn't figure out how to get it started so my dad said I should get off and come inside, just then THE SCOOTER STARTED AND I WAS OFF, I tried to stop but I fell off and scraped my left knuckles and my right upper arm BADLY. tldr: I fell of a electric scooter and hurt myself badly
I have been watching this channel for three years
You've never broken a bone bryson?!? You are so look lucky!!! Once I fractured my wrist at age 4 in a carnival.

In first grade I tried jumping over the black covering thing and I got my foot caught and I fell on my nose but didn’t break it
0:40 what the hell
Pittbulls are so cute
I was like you when i was your age
I like how you don’t leave a line before the first line of the description and “free trial (link here)” so I miss read it as “not to mention the wide range of psychological pain I’ve experienced, Free Trial!” So it’s like you are giving us a free trial of psychological pain…
1:26 The fact the apple imac  has a banana for the logo 😂😂😂
I got a scar on my eye brow because when I was younger aka 4, and my dad wasn’t in the room (I have split custody) and I jump from the rocking chair to the radiator, and then back to the rocking chair whilst it was still moving, and my head contorted into the metal rocking mechanism, these causing the scar (though it makes me look like an anime protagonist). And that kids is why doctors still can’t find my brain
Can't break what
Bryson l like a ham

I am losing blood at a alarming rateand would be most greatful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the would so i can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurley due to loss of blood.
ive only felt extreme amounts of pain once in my 11 year life so far. back when i was 6 we had (an still have) a 7 year old cat named barney. i used to chase barney around to pet him and one day he hid under the table on a chair. i tried pulling him off and he dug his claws into the fabric of the chair. carefully, i eventually pulled his claws out of the fabric as barney meowed, attracting our playful, 2 year old dog Maynor over to lick and clean him. barney got scared and dug his claws into my knee as i obliviously dropped barney off the chair and dragged barney's long sharp claws down to my ankle. he made 2 really deep gashes that were bleeding ALARMINGLY FAST. it felt like he had cut through a VAIN, but he didnt.
Hohoho ow my back!
in 0:40 that cheek i wanna slap that so hard

One time, when I was like 5 or so, I was watching some random ninja show with my sister. When she left, I thought  “I should try to do a flying ninja kick inside, that would be super cool”. That day I found out that walls have metal in them, also got a concussion that day too.
Once I was at a playground it was a long time ago I was swinging on the monkey bars and I started to swing in my hand started to slip off I tried to grab them but I jammed my finger on the pole and I fell down and face planted

Once upon a time I almost broke my arm
I’ve been through some pretty bad pain. Once when I was 12, I was doing a cartwheel and somehow DISLOCATED my left knee. I panicked and my Mom felt the same way. Eventually it thankfully slid back into place. But many months later I dislocated it stopping myself on a swing! That time I was taken to the ER and got it manually back into place. Scary and painful 🥲
I broke a bone
The fingers between the hing thing has happened with me once ...the scar is STILL there

I have a obsession with accidentally almost chopping off every limb, I had a piece of glass slice open my finger, then a hatchet screwing up my three middle fingers, and another giant piece of glass slicing open my foot, my life will probably go way downhill, and I will hit every hatchet and glass on the way down

Ham your lucky because when I had put my fingers in a door I got my middle finger ripped off and had to get it reattached.
Qustion and answer do like plants vs zombies
If something like that hit my funny bone I would probably need to go to the hospital because I have 2 extra bones Instead of 1 in my funny bone And 1 is like connected and growing out of it. I know it sounds crazy But it's true so i would probably Break my bone Like a wishing bone on a turkey. Also anytime I bang my funny bone, ( I'm talking about an Elbow) It feels like it's twisting my bone against my Muscles And blood and veins So will definitely hurt.😐👍
Me when am sleepy 4:30
you need more gore
One time when I was like 2 or 3 my dad went outside to have a call and I fell on a coffee table and I have a scare now
What’s worse hitting the fan or allergy shots on both arms🤔?
🤩🦄🍎🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
So this one time back in Ohio, I was riding my bike with my brother (this was in when I was 6 or 7). Our mom’s sister was there, and she was telling us to slow down, but I told her that we couldn’t slow down. So as we were riding, I looked back to see if my brother was coming (which was a pretty bad idea). So as I did that I hit TWO signs and went flying onto the road. I was wearing a helmet, AND there were no cars driving at that point. So I was completely fine.
One time I was at school I stabbed myself with a pencil it went through my hand I still have the scar

Same thank happened when I was small
The funny bone is a nerve and "I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and most gratfull you my caregiver transports me to the hospital to heal the wounds so I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending due to loss of blood" sounds familiar with odd ones out with that chocolate one with is way more complicated that a child with this I.Q is not mortal
4:23 is best
Somehow this is too funny for me that I subbed
This is supposed to be a family friendly channel not a gory channel!!!
Hey my name is Oliver I'm using my grandma's house because because I don't have any other flight to my TV yeah I I like all your videos over to 18 North scratch subscribers so you get appointment on your videos and put water on my phone I don't think she has all this a Google account I will save up and try to get smart but I don't have enough money for the merch so I'm going to save up and work

Me :what’s your worst injury.  My friend:I tripped 🥺. In my mind : I broke my jaw and blood fell from my mouth (could not eat for 2 months) I cracked my head open and got a cool scar I cracked me chin open and got another cool scar last of all I got my tooth cracked opened
Yelling screaming and fighting are all common  Me with the exact same family
“Stop touching me!STOP TOUCHING ME DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH then they hit me with that good sleep juice ima Tierd”

Bryson: I'm losing blood at an alarming rate, and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood.  Bryson: Nah, I'm kidding. What I actually said was, YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And also, 3:13 Lol. Butt.
I loved the part when he said. "STOP TOUCHING ME!!! STOP TOUCHING ME!!! DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?!?! STOP TOUCHING ME!!!!!!"

I’m a tired
I have a scar across my eyebrow
3:23 same when i was a child someone slam the dor and i like screaming and crying ngl
Ok so the story with the finger and the door, THAT SAME THING HAPPEB TO ME EXACTLY, just it was my index and thumb and I stretched my ligaments and good thing I didn’t tear them bec I would hav pain through my fingers my entire life even when I’m dead
the intro is literally the pain i feel when i fall off my bed at 3 am (it happens a lot somehow)
I had some nasty gashes and bruises Before. The worse one which I never felt the pain from was a rock to the forehead. It split the skin open and  I was bleeding alot. You could see the skull underneath once the bleeding was done. I was so dizzy but I kept myself awake as much as I could.
Your pain is worst than mine
No remove all limbs then you have nothing to break and nothing to lose
🤣 You lost money from a ceiling fan.
Lol
My sister close the door my fingers before lol
Keep it up with the screaming animations
I also have never broken a bone before like you.

A bracing I got a story for you so once I was on the swings with my cousin and then we were standing facing a house errand so I wanted to look at the sky but I got so focused on it a lego X-Wing handles and I did a triple backflip and then I hit the ground facing a safety building when there's a tornado and I didn't feel anything and when that happened I was only 5
Good thing you blew him up cuz I haven't broken a bone before

Pain
fun fact: funny bone is just a bone, and the reason you get that feeling is because of a dum muscle that does the whole "funny bone"
So you know how you put your finger in the door well not too long ago my brother and my mom we’re playing around and I accidentally put my finger in the door and it got smashed.
I once was in a bed and I jumped out of it like Superman and well let’s say I now have a scar across my eye
i experienced that almost like someone kept on poking pins at me arms
my dad slammed the car door on fingers=(
Why did you jump off the bunkbed you’re going to lose blood and you’re going to see your brain
Hey i have been feeling pain :EVERY DAY:!!!!!!!!!!
Ok this is pain
amogus
Now let's talk about my painful experience one time I was on a playground young and I was climbing high then due to cold hands it made it slippery so when that happened I was like at that moment he knew he messed up and I fell and broke my arm
My son can do the scerpen
You know those really thick gym doors at school? One time I put my fingers in the hinges and someone close the door and my fingers were absolutely crushed. The staff there gave me a ring pop and called my mom.
I was at a friends house once and was talking about how I always do stuipid things but never have broken a bone. About 30 mins later I crashed his dirt bike and broke my arm.
I turned into the guy that shamed Bryson for never breaking a bone-
Bruh at the end he says he loves us is why
Never broken a bone
Where's Bryson's Legs?
I broke a bone one hit my penis twice and worse of all I fell on the stairs 27 times *I M P E C C A B L E*

Reminds me of something. (Dramatic writing attempt maybe? Probably?) It was a normal school day, I was playing basketball with friends when suddenly the ball goes flying and I chase after it. My chase lead me to pass right under the basketball hoop where I, being the clumsy idiot I unfortunately still am today, trip and fall right into the pole, heavily scraping my knee in the process. Nothing broke but it felt like something did to me. I also only wore skinny jeans after that for some reason, so the pain of my scraped knee was much worse for longer than it should've been.
NEW CONTEST! PAIN... VS I Look Young.
Funny bones are not bones they are nerves
Almost lost my finger too I know how it feels

Yooo I also got hit by a fan on a bunk bed but it was at 3:00 in the morning
How in tf is he not dead in the intro
Lucky Bryson I broke both of my arms
If we didn’t have any bones would just be a blob and what’s interesting to me I have never hit my funny bone my funny bone with a pipe before and I’m pretty surprised I never done it before I got on Andrews but never gotten hurt like that
I have broken my ankle and it was fun but not really I gotta be in a wheelchair and have my very first cast and my friends but one day he saw me walk in I never thought I would see your face like that again
Life
I never have broken a bone in my
I like this one
I once sprained my wrist so I was walking home from the beach and I fell and landed on my hand and it hurt but we put a bandage on it and it hurt I’m fine now
I skateboard and ya know i was trying to go over the spine in the bowl, guess what I did a rock-to-fakey i know how to do them so It was all okay then... when I came back from the trick my board prob hit something like a stone, it was very scary since I didn't have any critical in jury's from skateboarding before besides bruises and cuts! I obviously fell and it my butt on the concrete so hard i felt like I just fell from the 7th floor but that wasn't the least of my problems! I had actully tried to stop the fall with my wrist/hand, it didn't work I got up and when I moved my wrist it felt like I had five fractures in the same spot lol my dad said it was just a hairline fracture and he said there's nothing to be worry about, I cried none the less we didn't go to the hospital or anything like that cuz we knew deep down if we stepped one foot into the hospital we would have to wait for a year to see what happend to my wrist. I cried, ALOT.
I don’t know why they call it the funny bone when you hit it it’s not even funny
the pain ive been threw 1.i have been traumatized by knifes 2.i  was bitten by a big doggo

POV: Bryson is my noob toy and I hurt em the noob toy: 💀 (my noobs face dose look like he’s seen somethings…)
I was sledding at a super tall icy hill and someone carved a hill into the ice right where I was sledding.. flew into the air and stayed on my sled instead of screaming, time slowed until I slammed against the ice and I looked around and everyone was staring at me, 2 strangers asked if I was okay meanwhile my grandma continued filming it until they took a step forward, then she cut the camera and ran to me asking if I was okay, I only had a scratch on my arm
0:54 Yep that's me
Hi Bryson it’s looks like you have broke 1 million bones you have the world record of breaking your bones

*stuck*
When he said his fingers got stick in the door hinges that happened to me and my bones did not break cuz i was young at that time.
A few ago I went jumping to my Couch and I hit my knee with the hard part
Roblox be like
Heres one of my stories =▷: so when I was younger (5) me and my little brother had a babysitter, just like any normal kid who came from where I lived at the time, and she had a dog who mainly stayed outside. Weeellll she also had a big tree with a wood swing (and wood plank with rope)so me and my Little siblings went over to my babysitter's house and were playing on the swing. We were screaming and giggling because thats what kids do. Well it was my turn, I was having fun screaming and laughing. My babysitter's dog was barking because she thought we were getting hurt. Then my babysitter moved the dog closer to us so she could play with us. The dog had a long enough chain to get right beside me and bit the swing. But instead she bit my hip. I screamed and my babysitter saw it all so she came and got me off the swing, lifted the side of my shirt that got bit, and it was purple and bleeding. My mom came running out of the house and rushed me to the car and got me to stop crying. When we got to urgent care the nurses or sum wrapped a bandage around my waist and called it a day. I still have the scar to this day. The end XD
When I was younger (10+ of the years 2010 to roughly 2016) I head my right eye poked in three different occasions; The first time was by a finger and head movement. Second time with my brother holding a stick because we were playing and I had to get an eye patch that was roughly the same color as my skin tone. The third time was me being an idiot; I got close to a plant that looked like a wheat plant and had to wear the eye patch again (JK, I wanted to wear it, but it hurt like hell and I didn't want to open the eye because of PAIN).
ouch:0

You are hilarious man, you should be proud of this YouTube channel and it seems you are. Keep up the amazing work.
TOMMOROW I GOT HIT BY A BALL(FASTER)
i love the videos :D
Lucky you I’ve broken a bon before.
Heres a pain story, i was a bit young when this happend and i was just laying down, when somehow my knee dislocated, may not sound like it hurts more then a broken bone, but it is because it lingers and over time to continues to get worse and worse, i had to take a tinkle winkle at the time so i was in a terrible time, took ambulance a coll 8 hours to get to my place give me laughing gas aka the good stuff i felt high and they snapped it back, my left knee was the one that got it, i couldent move and i was feeling sore, all around all day, now i hate hospitals, but that laughing gas is some good stuff, anyways done with the ramblings bye bye
well here's my i-almost-died-very-recently-but-miraculously-was-only-minorly-injured story:  i have chronic low blood pressure, which means i get dizzy very often and sometimes faint since my heart rate is slower than average. i am also an older teen, which is part of the age group most prone to fainting because of drastic hormone changes. so it doesn't come as a surprise that i faint quite often if i don't take care of myself properly and specifically. a few months ago, i was sitting on my bed upstairs and my grandma called me downstairs for something, so i jumped up and practically ran the few steps it took to get from my room to the top of the stairs since it was right outside the door. i had been doing homework all day and hadn't realized that i didn't eat anything yet at all, since the medication i take can get rid of my appetite, and it was around 6 pm. so i'm standing at the top of the stairs and i stop because i started to feel really dizzy, and before i had time to process anything i blacked out. when this happens, it feels like my brain literally shuts down. i have no memories, no feelings, i can't even think. im a blank slate. the main reason i know i fell forward was because the only thing i could feel was pain, and i couldn't even tell where at first. i later realized it was my face hitting the steps, and i also realized that the pain was the only thing that woke me up, otherwise i would've been slumped at the top of the stairs for a while if i had fallen backwards. when i opened my eyes i was still falling down the stairs but i had turned on my back and was flailing to try and grab anything to try and stop me. i was super disoriented and basically running on instincts, so of course i was unfortunate enough to not grab anything to slow me down and my back crashes into the pile of stuff at the bottom of the landing. at that point both my grandparents and my sister were rushing over to stop me and get me up, but it still took me an entire 10-15 minutes to actually get all my senses back and become fully aware. i could've broken my neck the way i fell, but luckily i only got a few brush burns and a smal cut on my back. i now have a schedule for myself and my family constantly reminds me to eat and drink etc. moral of the story, take care of yourself! otherwise you could be putting yourself in dangerous situations that could be prevented.  if you read this whole thing, thanks!! i hope everyone has a great day/night! 💖
put it in slo mo haha

2:06 the way you said “mom” was adorable
I feel ya Bryson i once had to get stiches when i was 10 because my dog bit me i only got 4 thought and didn't hurt either
3:23 same happened to me once, i was at school and we were queing and i was at the back of the queue. Then suddenly someone slams the door, and i instantly felt the pain. I started screaming (i was like 9 or smthn) and opened the door as fast as i could. There was like 100 students watching and they all panicked so much lol. But the teachers panicked even more and called an ambulance! I was at the hospital for like 3 hours and nothing acually broke even tho my fingers looked like i would never do anything with them again. Well good ending, nothing really bad happened, and also pretty cool memory since it was 13th friday
4:41 when you fail an exam and you go back a grade:

Imagine when he said mother as my caretaker pls transport me to the hospital so I don’t die to the loss of blood the mother said no :)
I see your remastered home in NC, still missing a brick, why did you have to shatter that brick
My entire nervous system went AHHHHHHHHH

That reminds me...
Same thing happened to me that different way so when I was on the floor I was like literally just zooming across it like a freaking spider or whatever and then I just got the idea to just boost myself cuz I was just using my feet to boost myself so then I did it and then I kind of went up a little bit so I can get an extra boost and then I freaking impaled myself into the couch and then I got my head busted all the way open in like there's like a lot of blood and you could probably see my brain or my skull
I've been injured twice. Bryson: well as can fix that: proceeds to throw every vehicle known to man at me
Ur just like TheOdd1sOut

Hi
Bryson
It's funny that the ad in the animation videos were fortnite but he spelled it fartnite
can i show you how i got the worst scar ever? yes or no comment
Bryson: 3 2 1 His 🧠: no please don't do it  Bryson: OOF
i have been ankle hurt from my. roller skates
quick tip next time you get into a lot of trouble and your father or mother comes out with the belt you need to deal with the pain and with every strike moan louder and louder it makes the older and yet mature humans feel uncomfortable which signifies the rising of a new alpha male/female
One time I was running though the hallway then one of my toes on my left foot when I got back to my room it was OOZING blood I felt so much PAIN :((
same fan thing happened to me and I fell from 7 ft onto concrete and on mu forehead
How to anime totoriyal

Bryson:why don't we get rid of all bones? You can't break what isn't there! Me:I herby declare every one is made of jello👍
mom?! i'm losing blood at a alarming rate and i would be most greatful if you my caretaker and guardian would escort me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so i can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood
This is all over tiktok with no credit or anything 💀
0:39 _uhm..._
right when bryson screamed  at the beggining i stubbed my toe
Why are you so funny bryson!?
yeah but no pain is worse than stubbing your toe and cutting it or geting a paper cut between your fingers
“Im a tired”  Omg😂🤣🤣😂😂

“I’m losing blood at an alarming rate, and i would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian will transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey. Rather ending it prematurely due the loss of blood.”

Once I ripped all the skin off on my right arm (I was at school at the time) and the teachers put 2 band aids on it 🙂then the next day I go to class with my hand wrapped up and the school had the audacity to say "wHy dO yOu HaVe YoUr HaNd WrApPeD uP yEsTeRdAy iT wAs FiNEeEeEEEeee" like NO SISTER. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. STUFF DOESN'T HEAL IN 1 ✨FRICKING✨ DAY. They made me remove it and that day my table was covered in blood and I had to wipe it off. When I got home my mum was so angry that she called the school and I didn't go to school for the next month. That was the most terrible thing that happened to me........
Bryson...MAKE MORE VIDS CAUSE' MY BRAIN IS GETTING SMOOTHER WATCHING YOUR POINTLESS VIDS- btw i like your videos :)
“Well too bad she isn’t coming back.”
When I was little my finger bone got bent the same way as you did
Foot-loss
The ohohohohohoh oh my back thing was sooooo funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. And yes the funny-bone is not a bone in us. And why were you saying,"STOP TOUCHING ME STOP TOUCHING ME DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH STOP TOUCHING ME!" And then you say in Mario's way," I'm a tired." That is ssoooooooooooo funny

Once when I was four or five we trying out for the pool I was the one first out and then my mom told me don’t go upstairs now I didn’t hear so then I went upstairs and the mom said no! When she came in I was like OK so I jumped off the first step like I always do! So then I fell face first and I lost my front tooth it go back what I was seven I think :(
When i was like 6 or 7 with my friends there was a big cement ramp that car use and i climbed to the very top and i fell at maximum speed, got some air time and i scraped almost my face, with my left leg bug i still got my both eyes, and yes im fine i got my both eyes and my face repaired with a big wound on my left leg.

Bryson you have inspired me to make my own YouTube channel!! (*ˊᗜˋ*)ᵗᑋᵃᐢᵏ ᵞᵒᵘ
I have a story. I was sitting in my school’s cafeteria and the chairs that they have there were apparently designed by Satan because whenever I reached around to grab something I would hit my funny bone on a corner and OH BOY was it unpleasant. And I would be one thing if it happened once or twice but it happened EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
Pain
Grayson it's been so long and you sander Damien message or you didn't in my life
this is alison sara's kid, and i  can't blieve you did not die! And i like you... 😻😺💋🥰😚🐶
All I know is pain
I love the boom:3
A while back I was running around my house when child me decided to jump... and kicked a door frame. I hit one toe  and spent the next minute  making a sour face with tears streaming down my cheeks and the worst pain i've ever had. Worst part is, we went to the A and E and waited for an hour just for them to tell us they didn't serve children. then we got a taxi and went to a different hospital were it took about half an hour to an hour to get to our room and get me sorted out. in the end, no broken bones, they gave my a numbing medicine, crutches, and wrapped my toes up. also my dad who was driving me around the hospital in a wheel chair, lost his balance, and crashed into a wall, my toe near millimetres from hitting the concrete wall, which would have resulted in screaming like the child I was. Also when I was like 3 or so I fell off a chair and split my head open, but I don't remember any of that. I do have the scar though. I agree, you do not need to break a bone to feel true pain, kick a door frame hard enough, and don't get any treatment for about 2 hours and you will know pain. Also about the babies having de-formable skulls, I know that that is true. when I was younger I would fall over at least 2 time sa day, on the same spot on my forehead, so eventualyl a small dent formed on my forehead. fantastic
My glutes went WAAA NAAA SHAAA FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA then it hurted and then it went WA SHA DOBI DOBI DOOO SHOOOOOOOO then I went to the hospital it was on January 31 it hurted a lot
He has the same ting as me I was hanging for a tree branch from my leg about to fall into a pit of nitels

When i was a baby,i was going down the stairs(might i mind it was CoNcReTe),i fell out my stroller and...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Edit: i fractured my skull in like 2 places.
The Scorpion is the reason you’re short sorry
lol
Me on a moving day “insert bryson screaming”
“It was so fast I didn’t even see it”             Reminds me of my dad
I broke my leg bone as a baby and then went super San went to the hospital shouting baby stuff or as I like to call it ikkcekdkddskkfkkddkdifjkrjgjjkt
“When you are younge you bones are still soft and springy” Me with all my bones broken:are you sure about that
Bryson the beginning is a bit weird
🤥
Good sleep juice
Same i never broke a bone
Bone broken %99 blood loss % ∞
One time I jumped down the stairs and broke the railing , so I just fell in the 3 foot gap  and broke my toe, but I didn’t see it feel it so I was crying bc I broke the railing and my parents were like: NO SCREW THE RAILING LOOK AF UR TOE”  I saw it curved and screamed, like a month later I threw my gloves on a sled which my brother  sat on, he shoved them off and I didn’t notice, so later when I wanted my gloves I had to walk al the way back in slippery ice, but I was 10 my dad came with me, he slipped and dislocated his shoulder,..but the place said “any injuries aren’t our fault” so I couldn’t sue em
And i love it
Everything is just memes
Wow bryson lost a lot of blood
My only problem is is this true
We all sometimes feel like screaming like that. I was sick the other day and my whole body was on fire and BC of pain. My mortality is reminded of constantly.
I agree with you Hank’s comrade
This is true
Healing wounds are such a good thing
Can I make a comic about evil you vs Me with my Darwin Group powers. Also I am a 10 year old kid named Darwin . That's my mom account.
It's just like my neck injury 🩸
the way you said '' stop touching me stop touching me! do you speak english stop touching me'' it made me laugh so hard
Bryson one time on a trampoline I almost broke all the bones in one of my legs that actually happened

Use tackle!
funny bones are nerves
The worst pain that I have is that when I'm jumping on a trampoline and I feel bored and decided to go to my house and once I go out of the trampoline and I feel pain or no pain on my feet and once I've checked its bleeding fast well I dont know how did it happend it just bleed for no good reason so I hop to my home and told my mom that I'm bleeding on my foot and she gave me two bandaid because it so long like maybe more or less than 2 cm under my ankle but it has been healed for few months or weeks and that's how I've got this scratch on my feet and Bryson if you reading this message you can ask any questions about my story if you want ok.

DID YOU REALLY KILL HIM
I like that he adds memes
2:09
Once I put my fingers in-between the closet door near the front door, My grandma closed it and I screamed and cried,
1:29 IS THAT A JOJO REFFERENCE
This reminds me of that one time where I fell off of my scooter while going down a road (It was a hill)
I'm losing blood at a alarming rate is the best
I  think I broke a foot
0:20 maybe edit that to look like you pierced yourself open + blood for R E A L I S M
its been more than a month since i last watched your videos, now i am back hope your all happy to see me back
The fact that *I've been so much pain in November and December*
my most painful experience issssss GETTING MAULED BY A FRICKING DOG AT THE AGE OF 6 edit: my eyes still hurt ever since because i probably have a popped blood vessel near my eyes so thanks alot mother for bringing the dog and doing absolutely nothing besides posting stuff on facebook and bragging about a child
Bryson ur just like me I murder
How the hell have I not heard of this guy. He's amazing.
0:36 i just love how he just beats the shit out of the guy
My funny bone is always annoying
You know I had some things like the fan thing happened to me except the only similarities were the head injury and the not feeling it till seeing the blood. 1 Like or comment and I will tell how. I promise it is actually funny
Ahhh yes I have many broken bones 🚊🤕😄🔫
Dude your soo Lucky you never broke a bone! I broke my Tibian and Fibian or Fibula on a trampoline and had surgery! ( I’m sure I spelled Tibian and Fibian ( OR ) Fibula wrong )
I have folin off a brig
i draw the ham a lot
1:34 and all your fight scenes in general kill me
The only time I remember getting severely injured was when someone slammed a locker door onto my hand :D
Face reveal at 5000 sub
3:14 that’s disgusting
i remember dislocating my arm then accidentally relocated it
3:25 this same thing happened when my sis and brother were in a fight
comepared to me i broke soo much bones even know im nine
0:23 AAAAAH 2:23 AAAAAH 2:43 AAAAAH 3:28 AAAAAH 4:12 AAAAAH
Honestly reason you didn’t even see that guy that was above you to make sure they eat he knows who is in make sure that you know who’s in charge you just should’ve looked up or just one of way why would you not do that I was so stupid why anyways that was weird but if you ever play squid game you’re dead
Lego ded Bryson is
I didn’t see it coming and I jumped DIES LIKE A MORTAL
I love the ham!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:09 - I think we all know what’s going on here
Did anyone realize that 1:48 was a drake meme
The funny bone I feel for him the pain is not funny
What I actually said was ayhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
My injuries:  1.) I jumped off the couch while I was barefoot and landed on a 6-8 in screw which went straight into my foot. My reaction was “AAAHHHHHHHH”. I had a hole in my foot for a few months.  2.) I fell off my bike cause I slipped on some pebbles on The sidewalk. I landed full force onto my arm. I’m amazed I didn’t scream or cry but I was close to. I turned on the TV and looked at my right hand. I saw that my pinky was bent all the way to The point that my fingertip touched The back of my index finger. I told my mom “I don’t think my finger is supposed to do this.” I went to 3 different hospitals to get X-Rays. When I got a cast my wrist was hurting. It turns out my finger was broken and jammed out of its socket and my wrist/forearm broke. I somehow resisted screaming at the top of my lungs when they had to yank my finger and push it back into its socket. I had a cast for about a month. My finger is fine now.
I love whenever the guy that always disagrees with him Bryson just beats the crap out of him
Are girl or boy
Hahaha hahaha  na just kitten this aaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaa hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha !!!!!!!!!!!!
I relly love your videos 😍 i want to be a animator to
What
I have been trying my hardest not even seen this week
Bryson looks funny a bit
funny bones aren't funny at all.
0:40
I have gotten run over bye a car
I cut my hand and then I did nothing I just used a thing I forgot what it's called and then done I did not feel pain
Ohh, it all makes sense why a Vinland aga character has an egg head now..
Did you sprain any part of your body
ALL OF THEM I DID THAT TO
I always hit my shin it’s so painful
One time I was playing grounders in grade 7 and it was raining... I slipped on this staircase thing and bashed my shin into the next stair up and I still have a dent in my leg to this day
Yeah, there indeed is pain that doesn’t involve broken bones. Ever seen how painful burns can be? First, second, and third and fourth can outright destroy nerves, which is super ouchies.
You wanna get your ex girlfriend back? TOO BAD she ain’t coming back buddy GOT ME LAUGHING SO HARD
I can relate to the fan
AaaAaaauUuUuuuHhhHhHH!!!!     Hi, I’m Bryson

Let's get one million  Let's get one million lights on this video
Ham
Nobody:  Box on ii s3 e5: 0:14  What it felt like: 1:32
Bryson if u remove all bones nothing will perfect your smooth brain
3:18 yea I’ve done that before but with a car door. It was also my brother who happened to slam it shut.
You: "Memory pain" My pov: Hi I'm new to memory pain I sprang my ancle 3 times, I ran into a door, I burned my hand 3-4 times on the 4th of July, I had rubber bands hit my fingers like 20+ times, sometimes I slap my face, and the ocean tried to kill me / I have been in pain like half of my life or more.
The computer being a banana instead of apple is just mwah
I couldn't stop laughing this whole video
One day I fell off my bike on the road and My Little Pony went blooding all the way down to my toes
0:44 same Bryson
Doctor: *Gives me a vaccine* Me (My reaction from outside): That didn't hurt. Me in the inside: 2:23
4:50 this is my favorite part of the video
The same thing happen to me. but my finger is ok
oh AND got into a car crash
Bryson I have a broken wrist

Bryson is the reason people keep dying
Poor haminations he fall of mountain
I’m getting band kid vibes
I think i just broke a bon in my leg

Oh heck
Luckily i have pain
Bryson i just seen you before
0:59 I hate that feeling
Same I have never broken a bone
My pain is being a jerk and hit by a wall
I crashed a bike at 15-20 mph honestly don’t know how I didn’t die I should’ve and could’ve went straight into the oncoming lane but the fence to the right of me *and the concrete* stopped me pretty quickly lol somehow walked back home with no skin instead of no *life*
I had pain all the time
Me and my best friend's first ever sleepover was kinda like your fan story I was five and he was six and all of a sudden his sister turns on the fan and he leans over to see what's going on below he was in a bunk bed and it cut the top of his head we had to go to the hospital and he had to get staples on his head but I got like five popsicles out of it and TRAUMA (we're still friends to this day)
I  broke my bone
Troll 😂 lol 😝 lol 😆
I got hit in the eyebrow with a brick
mock-10 you mean M-RK-10
But OUCH. PAIN. OW OW. PAIN.
But Bryson I’ve never gotten hurt before☹️
If you don’t have scars on your head and knees, you had a sad childhood
But if you have no bones you would only survive 8 mins
She hame
Anyone else gonna point out that the 2 beat downs in the video used the exact same SFX? Lol
I closed a door on my hand two times and I’m was like KILLED with pain
I have been rammed by a buck!!!
0:39

Not trying to hate but kinda cringe
My appendix ruptured (Like fully)  and I barely felt pain. The doctors said that it might of flipped so that's why but yeah.
I think I’ve found my new favorite anime the fight scenes are incredible

Those people being beat up should be honored because they are getting beat up by “the Bryson”
"You want your girlfriend back?. Too bad, she ain't comin' back buddy!" Lmaoooo
I was playing with a girl on my grandma's small neighborhood and there was a ball I was chasing when I reached my leg to kick the ball I messed I slipped and bashed my knee in to the hot damn floor of small rocks and concrete  well  all it took was some band aid and it was healing over I took it off because it healed completely well guess what I bashed it om the concrete floor AGAIN so I got band-aid on my knee and this time I didn't bash it again
And its 9$ and 99 cents and he less then ten bucks why
Put it on 2x speed 😂😂
How did he not die
brysons first trollface
Pain sucks
So Bryson hit his head so hard that he lost memory
Hey man! Your videos are great but a few of your lines are almost identical to a guy called TheOdd1sOut. I just wanted to make sure if you were copying him or you’re just a fan!👍

HOW DID U ONLY GET 3 INJURES idk if that's right AND I GET 5 ;-;
I love your videos bryson

So you're telling me if we remove all of our bones we would become ditto or muk from Pokemon
I have a similar injury to his for example once my parents friends son said hey follow me so I did he and slammed the door and little did he know MY PINKY FINGER WAS IN THE CRACK IN THE DOOR Soooo what I did was….. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Long story short I broke my nail and I got stitches and now my nail is shorter then the other

I liked to jump when I was a kid in fact I jump high now because of that so there was this one time I jump and my did a 360 and sniper a kid in the head and fortnight danced no but it just did a 360 nice.
I cracked my ankle
I've watched Bryson for quite along time now and I love his animations!
Pain=yes
I stepped on a nail and it went straight through my foot. YOUR PAIN MEANS NOTHING TO ME!!!
Bryson: ..Mom? Mom: Whats up honey? Bryson: *I'm losing blood at a alarming rate and would be most grateful if you , my caregiver guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so I can continue my mortal journey rather of ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.*
Never insult Bryson
One day me and my family was at the gym my brother  was on a treadmill and I wanna to try to get on it and I called my brother  saying I wanna get on and he let me and put it to 20 knowing  it was to fast and I slip and my finger got caught  up in the treadmill yeah<3

Eat teh ham :)))))))))))))))))))
0:39 *never underestimate Bryson*
hm yes child dies the video.
I fell off my stairs really bad and I went to the hospital
Bruhh the white bully guy need some help WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BREAK A BONE
Once a 10 kg stabilizer fell in my head and now I have a very big skar
I cut my eye brow once I was at gap (pretty ironic) and I dropped a transformers pamphlet I bent down to reach it and I hit the edge of the metal table I was bleeding pretty bad and worst of all the gap manager refused to call an ambulance because he didn't want to cause a scene they stitched me up with blue stitches I was made fun of at school because it looked like a spider was living in my eye brow
again 4

I sprained my ankle when I was in 2 andddd it hunted
Im glad i havent actually been in too many accidents, my two worst pains i can remember having were the one time i tried to climb the monkey bars we had at school. In winter, with ice covering it, wearing gloves, which had absolutely no grip to them. Naturally, i slipped, and landed face-first into the gravel below. It hurt a ton, but it didnt end up bleeding at all suprisingly, and only scabbed. The other time was when my dad came home from work on his motorcycle, and I greeted him in the garage. I ended up accidentally tripping and landing my leg on the VERY HOT METAL ENGINE and i had a burning pain in my leg for like 2 weeks
One time when I was 4 or 5, I taped 2 lego bricks together, but I wanted them to be seperate again, so like any sensible human, I used scissors. You know that piece of sort of webbed skin that connects your index finger to your thumb? Well the scissors slipped, and it went THROUGH it. All I remember is that there was a lot of blood, a lot of crying, and now I have a scar, an everlasting and eternally present reminder of my own mortality.

Translation with the word pain  into French: bread
He is losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if her, his caregiver and guardian would transport him to the hospital to help heal the wounds so that he can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood.
Okokokokokokooplokpkokokojivyxfyf
Wait so you're saying your back isn't supposed to bend like that well I can

To be honest I’m hurt right now I stepped on a piece of glass and it bled like so much
That guy Bryson you've never broken a bone before a couple minutes later the guy said but Bryson I've never been injured before
Can we just appreciate the fact that we get to see  all of this pain
He said mortal!! He is right!!! But in the way you may not expect, in (2022? 2023?) the rapture will happen, and the ones who do not believe in god (Lord Jesus Christ) will be killed!
You can NEVER stay away from pain.
I once put my 2 front teeth through my bottom lip it didn’t hurt though. I also scraped all the skin off my knee yeah Pain.
How I learn to draw is to trace over another drawing by tracing the outlines of the drawing

P fun time I was little and my mom was giving me a walk a rock tripped me out of a cliff he's actually a little Hill and then I I thought I broke my leg but my leg was in big pain but it wasn't my leg I felt pain in my ankle it was so painful I thought I broke it but my mom said I screwed the bone and I scratched it so I was had to have ice cubes at the store and had to be dried with the card every time so I didn't walk for a hundred weeks only one time when my leg was getting healed me it it was still in pain but I walk very slowly like when I run fast I feel pain so my mom kept pouring water on my own my poor little leg to stop it to stop to hurt but it's still didn't help it just kept going when I kept walking my life was terrible I didn't like it I feel the same thing like you feel I feel the same like I was in big pain and only I had to go on a pink roller and my mom rolls me around that's how I can walk now and she put it ice cubes but only one thing I can only stand on I I can't stand but I can't walk I mean run one time I squeezed on my scooter with my sore leg but I had a nice little ice cube so I took it off and I scooted around but I didn't use my other leg a lot because my ankle so some people have the same injuries like I do like your last video like someone else and someone else fought they broke their leg but the doctor said they're like it's fine so they scratched their leg and it feels like it's broken so I feel the same like you because I mean great pain but my ankle heal but now I'm free to pills is that the burger Hill in the school Hill but I'm afraid of back hills with a bunch of trees so I only walk on streets or actually not having rocks and so I'm actually afraid of those now

I’m sharing a story too.      So one time I was on the playground (in 3rd grade) quite some time ago, we had a cool playground. It was green and there was a rock climbing thing. Like literally a plastic rock to climb. And it had rained a little. So the teacher still let us on cause they didn’t think it was too bad. So I was running in tag and starting climbing up really quick. But since it was plastic, and wet, I slipped. I didn’t just slip and fall, I fell backwards, but my head was bent back. There was a pole behind me and I hit my head on the TOP. I passed out. Yep. I was unconscious. I woke up a few seconds later (maybe 20?) because I heard noise and kids were surrounding me. When I woke up the all left. The teachers hadn’t seen me. I had sat up and rubbed the top of my head. I had grabbed the pole to stand up to find a bloody handprint when I lifted away my hand. I was sent home and stayed home for three days I think. It was pretty bad.
Bryson shouldn't put sponsorship advertisement at the final parts of the vid,i skipped it

I once had a similar PAIN incident,  when i was in school i was in a bathroom with a VERY heavy door. i put my fingers in and then it started closing, luckily i was right next to the principals office so i screamed at the top of my lungs and got many bandages.
that is not a bug. thats a feature. pain is your friend after all. right? -boris washington of the UK of america 2021
The beginning looks like it hurts 💔😢😫
He epik i wouldnt even have thought to jump from the top bunk
You know what is REAL pain? Well then imagine getting hurt a way that makes you mute! Heres the story:all i remember was that i was spinning on a spin chair and then i falled out of it, making me luckily not bleed, but make me not speak! Then my mom called my dad and they started arguing about should they take me to a hospital or not, then i just got bored of it and tried to say yes, i couln't, i tried to scream, it was very quiet, then i just drawed on paper yes cuz, yes... So they delivered me to the hospital and just instantly got medical help, i guess they knew the pain and stress i was going (sorry for my english, i forgot the word ;-;),i got help and after some minutes i could talk again, man the stress and pain of not being able to talk ;-;
2:40 OK 3 2 1 * bunk * AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You do not have to use Skillshare you can just use YouTube so there is no reason to use scale share now stop saying to use apps that we do not need to use those things are a gift that we can use and also there is a lot of other apps I can use like Skillshare but it doesn’t have to be Skillshare but only for 30 days that is not gonna last you every day so you cannot use that would be a waste of your money Brisin

Me who remembers the pan that broke on my skull when I was 8 that fell from the top shell giving me a scar on my forehead. Later I pretended to be harry potter and superman because the large thick sturdy pan broke on my head.
The “funny bone" is actually a nerve. The ulnar nerve runs along the inside part of your elbow. It sends information to the brain from your pinky finger and the finger right next to it. It also controls some of your hand's movements.
0:00  I felt all that :')
I got my finger slammed in a door too it really hurts
He has broken bones, just not his.

Your soooo funny
2:43 five nights at brysons jumpscare
now i can't say it was on this scale but 1 time i was skating and i fell my arm was strait out in an attempt to save myself but it hurt like heck and i was screaming all the cusswords that came to mind
cant break what isen't there
His description of hitting your funny bone was actually very accurate. One time I was running and hit a doorframe with my elbow, and the pain legitimately traveled though my entire arm to just about where my hand started, the pain would’ve been like 5 times the amount if would’ve been if I hit it on any other part of my body which is the “Fire” part. And there would’ve been some weird cold spots that felt like a shock that you would feel on some playgrounds if you ran your hand through some of the metal, but this time a little bigger and longer which is the “electric part.” I was honestly so surprised at the accuracy of how he described it because before this video was posted, that incident actually happened around a month ago. It’s very surprising how after that happened, there’s literally no damage to your elbow (unless you really injure it) which I cannot even imagine how that feels. I am very happy on how brief and accurate it was, great job Bryson.
I finished the video on 1:13
Kick Punch Slap Squish Stomp ButtClap NeckSnap Bash his head 69420 times at max speed

then how are you going to get blood   if there's no bone ?

what inspired you to make this its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
His intro sounds like he gonna play video games
damn i cut my hand while i was making a talisman well im losing blood slowly weird enough is that the knife was a sharp utility knife sharp like a razor well at least i dont feal the pain oh and i also burnt my whole hand when i was making tea yes im an idiot i was tired and my hands wobelly so i poured steaming hot water onto my hand and then i didnt even care even tough i had blisters i just cut them off and put alcohol on it little i knew that it will cause so much pain so i poured freezing cold water on it man im an idiot  🤣
im losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver/guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so that i could continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood
Im a tired
Once I was in a garden with shorts I felt onto solid concrete rock ground in a area that wasn't covered and I had very big bleed and hurt spot years later and I still see the mark luckily no hospital

3:24 I can relate to dat cuz dat happened to me, and my finger went purple and I was transferred to the hospital to get my nail removed off of my finger to stop the swelling and trust me, it hurts ;-; anyways after that the only thing that came to my mind looking at that finger was a human brain, since the inside of my finger looked like a HUMAN BRAIN which was very disturbing. *the end*
The funny bone is a nerve i know because my mom had it so bad that putting the slightest pressure felt like fire she says it still tingles even after surgery
1:20 it’s not? Huh.
I like that he is being healed by a Shaman

If you don’t have any bones in you do your bones will mentally break but if you don’t you still can bleed so if you don’t have any bones you came and move you just feel pain when you fall with no bones you just get you blood

Dude you really love beating up people
me: has an injury*  what should I say? option #1: I hurt myself and i need help! option #2....:  I am losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you: my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so i can continue this mortal life rather than ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood.   option #1 option #2 <---
I love the part when bryson's head hits the the basketball hoop that was very funny i like the sound effect
‘İ slammed my Finger’ that happened to me too

I remember that one time when I was 5, me and my older sister had bikes, and while I was learning how to ride it, I fell off. I was bleeding a bit because our driveway was pavement, so my mom and dad got me inside and put a wet washcloth on my head.  There was also another time where I was rolling around like a rubber ball, and rolled down the stairs to the basement. I literally didn’t even know better, and I was 4.

one time I was getting off the car and realized I had something that was still in the car, so I went to get the item but at the same time closed the door because I thought I had gotten everything, so that meant that by the time I put my thumb in the car... it was too late and my nail was in the door. nothing broke but my nail had to fall off that way a new nail could grow

I had i punching bag and i hung on to it and it fell of the siling and the metal hook hit my head with the pointy side
I have nocturnal epilepsy, and when I have a severe seizure, it's the equivalent of a Special Attack in Pokémon, compared to a Physical Attack. It's like being engulfed by the very essence of nightmare itself, and all the while, your mind feels the pain of 11000 suns burning it to a crisp, and just sitting up makes your head explode in pain, all the while your stomach will occasionally not want its contents in it anymore, but emptying it would cause your head to explode. On the upside, I've suffered extreme physical injuries during these, but have no recollection of them. I've banged my head, bashed my shin, scratched my face, and even gotten a gash from my collarbone down to my upper arm, but because my brain was busy being injected by the demon of nightmare itself, it doesn't realize that the rest of my body is a thing and pays it a no nevermind.
well speaking of funny bones,, i once fell really hard onto mine :)
Bryson:do you want your ex girlfriend back? She isn’t coming back honey... Me:DO YOU WANT YOUR NECK SNAPPED?
Do you have roblox

Actually there’s no such thing as a funny bone it’s actually just a vein that you hit incense veins are very fragile it makes a electric reaction gone all the way through your vein so technically there is no funny bone, science!!

Your not the only who has a scar on their eyebrow. It happened to me in third grade. I’m in 5th now. But me and some friend were playing freeze tag when my friend and I bumped into each other. We both wore glasses. So she had just a bruise under her eye which left a black mark. But me my entire eyebrow was bleeding. So I had to get a patch to stop the blood. But I only needed glue to patch it up. When they had to get some of blood off, it was supposed to hurt but instead tickled me lol. So I’m fine now. They just glued it. No stitches. I still have the mark now too. So yea. Your not the only one with a bad mark
Lol

Hamination is da best
There was one time I got hurt real bad! Me and brother were getting out of the pool and {Might I say that we had a wired fence} and he pushed me off the ladder and I fell onto the wired fence and split open my armpit. We were rushed the hospital and had to stay there for 4 days to make sure it didn't get any worse. I got stitches and got a needle shot everyday. I still have the scar to this day!
Nobody:  Me: so the first time i got heart was wen brison  made my bones go not you can not stand to day

My worst injury is probably by far me falling down 2 flights of stairs and then rolling down like a plastic bag in wind right down to the one of the roughest road I have ever stepped foot on and no, a car didn’t hit me, but I wished it did because I was in the worst pain I had ever experienced ever and the worst part was that I didn’t faint or anything I was conscious through the whole thing aND NoNe oF mY BoNeS  bRoKe

I've hit the "funny bone" on both my arms so hard and so many times, that at one point I couldn't touch my elbows anywhere for a week or I'd feel a shock. Now my elbows have been numb for a few years since, I feel nothing on them anymore.
Hi
Wow .-.
3:28 I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS! 😡😡
But bryson if we dont jave any bones our most important organs might just rip and tear bc if we just  hit our body on anything sharp our organs will tear and rip open and we'll die like our heart

Mario
There was this one time when I was 7 years old. It was morning on Fourth of July. I was walking down the hallway of my house and then my uncle scared me, because y'know, he's an uncle. I screamed as I fells backwards into a corner and cut my head open. Fast forward, I got staples and now I have a scar that's almost impossible to see because of my long thick hair 😃
I've never broken a bone myself, but probably the worst I've ever been injured was when me and my cousin decided to ride in a wagon down a hill being pulled behind a tractor that a family friend of my cousins' was driving. At the bottom of the hill, he went to turn. Except then the wagon flipped. My cousin definitely got the worst of it because he was unlucky enough to be on the outside of where the wagon flipped, so he got launched from it like a catapult. Meanwhile I end up underneath the flipped wagon like a crab. My aunt and uncle just looked down the hill and saw me staggering back up the hill with a bunch of scrapes, cuts, and bruises. So yeah, that was painful. I ended up with literal rocks embedded into my knees that we had to get out, too. I can't remember exactly how bad my cousin got hurt, but he wasn't any better than I was. As bad as that was, now, several years later, I see that as a funny story of stupidity and bad judgment that led to a situation that's kinda funny in hindsight.
no one : radom person:but bryson i never felt pain befor:bryson:well we could fix that ahhhhhhhhh me: i fell down the stairs and a sharp stick whent trough my leg and got stichis
2:07 *im losing blood in a alarming rage and you my angel guardian can teletransport into the hostital so my woom go out and i can continue my day*

Don't break bones!!!!!
İ have super duper pains🤭😰😰😥😥
I have broke 2 bones in my life and... It's painful at the beginning, when you broke it, but then 2 or 3 days later only hurts when you touch it. I think the door slam is more painful than that really (at least for me, I have medium resistance to pain, so don't consider it the opinion of all, pain is pain and everyone has their own resistance so don't be mean)
Your so good
are u troll man
Thanks for killing me for the 100000000000000000000000000000000000th time

Jeffy
why sound Yung ughhhhhhhh my name Jeffy see sais it on noting
I had the worst pain a couple days ago. I learned that my root of my tooth was connected to my jaw bone. And it needed to be removed.. I thought my jaw was going to break. I do remember once that I was getting ready for school and it was raining hard. I ran fast so I wouldn't be late. I slipped on the wooden steps and slid down the steps. My back hurt so much that breathing hurt. I told my mom that I think I couldn't go to school that day. My mom asked if I needed to go to the hospital. To me going to the hospital is worse than school so I went into the car, clearly in pain and told her I was fine. Luckily, it healed. I also think I got a broken nose because a basketball hit me straight in the bridge and now it feels like there's a bump there. I dunno if it was there before or after that so...
I actually never broken bone, we are the same.
IS THAT NONSENSE
THIS Is 30  minutes of Pysycal pain    PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIN PAIM

Nice vid
“But Bryson I haven’t got hurt before”     *Well we can fix THAT*
Bryson you and I have never ever broken a bone lol
hi
That's all that has happened to me well enough to don't have to count + I have broken my arms 2 times had a neadel through my leg broken my nose and  had rocks fall on my toes so many times  But I am still a kid  my age is 12 so yes now you have it Bad huh😡😡😡😡
Omg. What. The. Noob
Those look more painful than when I got a blister on my hand for touching a stove  heater little did I know the stove was on
Instead of going like this i would go like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA btw 1:45 5:04 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 4:25
you like me you get hurt lot times
He looks like a ham
Haaahhaaaa
I have to I Brose blood  That was were very pain then I my parents got a Dr and my eyeballs little bit gone
Fun fact: the funny bone is actually a nerve that u agitate. That place that hit the nerve is actually a small opening under the skin and since its a nerve your hitting, i would explain why it felt like an electrical surge in your arm since the nervouse system uses electrical messages to and from the brain. This vid was hilarious and i enjoyed it. Hope to see more 🙃
Haminations I eat ears and you

My pain that I have (almost) always experience, is at my school (Lawton, seattle). During a recess, I am running around, then somehow every now and then, I manage to trip on something that doesn't exist, maybe its egg's ghost thats tripping me.

Ham i must have the HAM Bryson's kill count is now over 50 cuz he's killed over 50 people and his dreams in this video
To make you feel better I'm telling you some of the stories that I have been a lot of pain and surprisingly I have never broken a bone either  probably going to be long Okay so one time I was riding my bike down this very large Hill and it was steep and I fell off it's scraped my knee my my head hurts so bad surprisingly I didn't break a bone 😂 and another time I was on my bike and I was speeding racing and I accidentally swerved too hard and I didn't hit my head but I fell on my butt and scraped my knee another time I was holding my cat in the eye fell off the side of the bed and hit the cat carrier ... And another time I fell off a hammock it was too high and I was like probably eight and I was super small so I couldn't get off and they put it up for my birthday and I was trying to get off and then I fell when I was swinging it trying to get off I bumped my head really hard and another time I was nearby cats that are box and we have hanging TV we build it and I hit my head on it and then another time now these were just ones that I've clumsy I hit the wall so hard it felt like I was in so pain and this is the last one I can remember so my mom just got home and I went to go out and my cousin was taking the dog out and when he was taking the dog out he is the same door that I was going in and then he slammed the door in my face which it was iron yeah I didn't feel good I had a huge golf ball on my face literally it was the size of a golf ball and another time I think I fell off the monkey bars and like kind of like the vibration of me like not being able to grip just hit my foot so bad so yeah that's all I can remember and I've been perfectly fine through all these situations
The @$$ clap tho
When I started watching this video I had pain

Don’t run kids… Or your arm will be dislocated and you need to go to the hospital and have surgery done on you
Me sitting here with a broken arm
Well looks like you broke you entire body
Most of my dreams I get spit in half and I would be still alive.  I was like: Here we go........again
OK so this happened in PE and my PE  the court there’s like a metal ring around where all the kids can run so keep that in mind .  In PE we were playing a running game it was a lot like tag except you couldn’t go literally everywhere you had to go in a straight line and hope you wouldn’t get tagged I was ONE of the last people playing and I was running so fast that I had slipped on the metal and hit my head against the brick wall and passed out for a second is so when I had figured out what I had happened I was in so much shock that I didn’t even notice I was in pain .  and yes I did get sent to the nurse I was fine I am fine .
Why are these so funny
:C

Here are some times I got injured. I was blowing into a pvc pipe and then it jammed into my teeth and then I covered my mouth and then there was blood on my hand from my mouth I also threw the pipe and then there was blood on the pipe and I was like oh crap! Another time I got injured was when I went to a summer camp someone stepped on a yellow jacket nest and a bunch of us got stung I got stung on my arm, chest, and both sides of hip and the girl who stepped on the nest got stung up in her legs. Last one is I was dancing down these two brick steps on my front porch fell and I hurt butt, I'm not sure if I hurt my back or not, and the bottom of the back of my leg.
me watching the add:- OMG THIS IS SO STUPID! *The add end's* Me:YES NOW I CAN WATCH THE VIDEO>:<
Guess what I never broken a bone eitherl
When i broke my arm i didnt feel pain i only hated looking at it
Lmao I got appendicitis once. It hurt, but what hurt more was not being able to eat at all for the entire day. I was so hungry that it started causing my physical pain that was stronger than the appendicitis itself. What made it worse is how when I went to get a cat scan, I told my mom she should take my little sister to McDonald's because she's little and she needs to eat before she becomes extremely grumpy. When I got back from the scan i was expecting them to be eating in the parking lot or at McDonald's but no, they were eating in the room that I was staying in. They were eating in front of me. Knowing that I couldn't eat anything. Then my sister tried giving me a French fry but I couldn't take it because I couldn't eat and then she started crying because she thought I hated her. ✨👌😎✨
.
I have the same scar
Tip to self: Don’t call Bryson a stupid idiot
Nice animating 4:23

4:44 Ads for boy: how Bryson: hears ow
Same
It's actually a fact that broken bones hurt less than a sprain/ripped ligament. I actually don't say that in like "I lOOkEd iT uP!!" I've broken my wrist and ankle before and both of those injuries hurt wayyyyy less than a sprain or ripping a ligament (I've ripped a ligament before and holy SHIT, it hurts SO MUCH MORE than breaking a bone. Even worse was that it was in my leg and for 3 weeks I could not walk or I legit screamed in pain. Horrible, I don't recommend ripping a ligament lol--)

Fun fact: The funny bone got it’s name because it’s actually called the humerus, pronounced hugh-m-air-us but people pronounced humorous, thus giving the name “funny” bone.

I haven’t broke a bone EVER in my entire life but I had 1 MAJOR accident last year. It was International Star Wars day and I was at the gym playing a game. I was running when I tripped and my cute cheeks and punctured by sharp metal. When I hit the ground I could not feel my cheek. My parents took me to the hospital and I had to get over 50 stitches.  Personally I think this happened because it was International Star Wars Day and I don’t like Star Wars so it was karma.

The most painful thing is accidentally stepping on your dogs tail and not being able to tell your sorry.
Brysen: his fingers slammed into a wooden door  Me: literal car door slamming onto my big toe and it be stuck there for a  solid 5 mins

random person : i never been in pain be for bryson : starts to beat up the random person
Ive seen this 17 time in the past week
Hey guess you are bume
My pain is having no internet
Me too
Actually your funny bone isn't a bone at all, it's an area of exposed nerves. That's why it hurts so much when you hit it
I paused it at the wrong time and bryson looked a paper cut out
Shut up
My buddy’s using banana as a  iPod
1:57 made me laugh my ass off

Here's an example of my form of pain one time I was wrestling with my older cousin and  we went to go roll over and he put so much pressure onto my wrist it fractured so I  was taken to the hospital and and how you wear a cast around my wrist in my arm for I'd say about a good month so yeah it hurt it was like this imagine getting punched in the face and then getting stung by 2000 bees that's how much it hurt.
This guy is so funny
-Bryson gets fingers smashed through door hinge and doesn’t break them- -me gets my finger broke my bending it a little-
Fun fact: Your funny bone is what makes your arm move :)

Did u know that the funny bone is a vain
I've broken my pinky.   Yeah, I cried for like half an hour and didn't get it checked until the next morning. I missed making slime with my class.  My pinky broke weird tho, it was like straight, then slanted. Luckily, it grew back normally. I now have capture the flag because that's how I ended up breaking it.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
To much pain
𝑾𝒐𝒕
In some my dreams there was the "TortureDream" the dream where i felt pain which i never felt
0:54 I've had this happen to me with a SEATBELT, my (clumsy, impatient) girlfriend sitting on my left quickly took her seatbelt off to jump out of the car and she was sitting in the middle, which meant the seatbelt FLUNG from the left to the ceiling, and my elbow injury was collateral damage. I was crying (which I NEVER do, ESPECIALLY in front of my family) I felt like it broke the bone inside and it was interally bleeding. It turned purple and I felt like I couldn't move my arm for like 15 minutes. After that, I had to just walk off the pain because we had a hike planned. I just held my arm in a way so it wouldn't touch anything because I KNEW my girlfriend would be hugging and touching me the whole time, which of course she bumped my elbow a lot. I think she just had to walk separately from me while I tried to walk off the pain.
OMG I HAVE A SCAR BY MY EYEBROW TOO
Owies
I have so many bites and bodies then u

I remember when I got injured.  I was 10 when this happened.  So me and my cousin, brother and friend was chilling when suddenly my cousin kept bothering me. My cousin was a huge fan of wwe so I kept fighting with him telling him to stop. Then all of a sudden he picked me up by my feet and my head slammed into the window seal.
Me: Mom can we get Haminations Mom: No we have Haminations at home Haminations at home:   👁 👚 👖 👣

hello from low opacity ham lmao
I fell and my body went ahhhhhh
Ok number 1: 1:39   I was sitting on my bunk bed, zoneing out, when my mom called me.  I dissided that to safe time, that I would forego useing the ladder, and just jump of the top bunk.  Little did I know, the fan was going at top speed.  It was so fast, that I didn't even see it.  So I jumped and...  *Insert sound effects of Brycen useing a free scream and the sound effects for the Lego bits dropping onto the floor*  It happened so fast, that I didn't even feel it at first.  When I reached out to check the damage and then saw the blood.  MoooOooOoom "What's up honey?"  *I'm losing blood at a alarming rate and I would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurity due to loss of blood.*  Nahh i'm kidding. What I actually said was...  *Insert another sound effect of a scream, but louder*  **Fin**                                    (Subscribe to Haminations you bitch)
I broke my fingers from someone closing the door on them. :/
The door one made he scream omg the pain that must have happened
I also got hurt in the finger because of doors, but what hurt me most in my 9 years of living was when I went to Shatkhania (Bangladesh) in the hospital where I was born, and when it was night, it was pretty dark (maybe I woke up in the middle of the night) and then I hit the left edge of my head on the edge of the bed and it left a short valley on my head. It was like 3.5 millimeters tall and less than 4.3 centimeters wide but now it’s gone
Bryson: literally beats someone up

One time as a 3 year old baby in Mexico I was walking into the bathroom and tripped and slammed my head right on it and the ones it Mexico are made of stone not plastic so I busted my upper brow open and I had to get stitches but they didn't have small stitches or numbing medicine because its Mexico and there poor so they used big stitches and I felt everything.

I've had much pain, no bone has broke
What do u use to edit
I love all his cold opens!
one time i was playing around in the sprinkler that my parents have. We were using it in our grandparents yard and i decided to take a break and walk away. That's the moment when i saw the nain sticking out of the wooden board. I cut my entire leg open.  Me: "..." "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
I am still youngish and my bones are hard as heck-  I broke my lower ankle while trying to play basketball (my least favorite sports game but we were forced to play it) and as I broke my lower ankle, someone else tried throwing the basketball in the hoop but it bounced off and hit my head and I had to use a wheel chair- NO SCHOOL!!! >:) (just kidding)

0:34 I died of laughter at this part
I got my hands slammed in a door too

I also never broke a bone
my worst injury is when i was hit in the head with a soccer ball on the concrete p.e. track and fell over scraping my elbow open to the point of blood, and scraping both knees AND hitting my head on the ground i atleast got to go home early
When I was a kid, I got hit by a car and got my head injured, and now my head works fine, so I have felt pain before
i was walking in my house once when i was little little did i know there were 2 nails stuck together that day my leg knew it was fucked up lets just say i didnt feel the pain

I keep hitting my funny bone
I broke my arm before you’re lucky
1:32 jojo part 5 GER beatdown B)
Haminations:my entire body paint me who forgot to do homework:wait.. your entire body pain?
I think surface wounds hurt more than breaking bones because your nerves are closing to the surface. As proof I once broke my wrist and since I broke it my brain went "THERE IS DAMAGE THIS IS BAD GET HELP GET HELP GET HELP" so naturally I screamed. But after I was done and being taken down the hallway and I actually connected with my body I relized it didn't hurt and stopped crying. I just realized I picked up your speech pattern oh no.
5:41

Here’s a crazy fact and don’t freak out because this fact is crazy...did you know that pain is painful?!?
Hold up do you have a bald spot there
I broke my ankle yesterday 😫
I remember falling off a tree and barking a tree branch with my back and I had a fractured rib
There was once a really weird time that I got hurt. so I was at my school one day, just a normal day, a day like any other, a day were a child would get hurt unexpectedly and not even feel it, so I was playing on the playground and I was playing with my friends and I thought hey you will be fun if I went down one of the really huge slides face first so I did that and I guess I went a little too far and so there is a wooden railing that separates each part of the playground from one another? Yea, so as I slid down the slide I hit that wooden barrier and scraped my wrist on a nail head. I didn't feel it somehow but I did a freak out because I was a dumb stupid idiot back then, I was so young. _ /(•~•)\ _

I’ve never broken a bone but when I was a kid my sister and I thought it would be a good idea have both of us ride the trike down the hill. I was hanging on the back and my sister rode it down the sidewalk on our steep hill. It then flipped over and I scraped my back on the concrete. It was horrible.  My mom also took me trick or treating when I was two and I flipped out of my stroller going down a steep drive way onto my face.

ah yeas, my most painful memory. when i was doing hand stand pushups by a wall, and the coach supervising the weight room at school decided you shout my name loud enough to cause grown men to cry, causing me to jolt, which caused me to fall, and hyper extend 4 of my fingers to my right hand at 2x the speed of sound. only to find out, they were shouting at a kid with my name, for just sitting around doing nothing. :D
I could watch this 1000 time

This hurt's me when I was watching I this. 😀
0:19 this is WHY i never eat cookies i fall from the top and the bottom :D    edit: 2:08 me when i got serious injuries
Also, storytime : similar to your scar, I had one time in my childhood where my uncle who I will call Ninten, was making a coffee table, me the excited hyper child I was, jumped up and down on the top of a couch which would be facing the coffee table, me facing the window on a tightrope esque narrow walkway that was the back of the couch, which was facing the window, and me being stupid; actually a child baby child, was so hyped to see my uncle that I bounced on the ledge, lost my balance, and went head first into the table, and my mother who's name will be Paula, had a kidney stone, and also preggers with my little bro who for the sake of identity, is Looigi, couldn't make it to the hospital, also didn't get stitches, instead super glued the exposed skin shut, and finally leads me to have a z shape where hair is missing and where super glue put exposed skin and muscle together which is on my right eyebrow, finally, MY name is Aidan Wells, and that was my story.
Person:how? Then he beats person up at 4:45

STOP TOUCHING ME STOP TOUCHING ME DO U SPEAK ENGLISH STOO TOUCHING ME 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Mooooommm What’s up honey I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so I can carry on this mortal journey rather than ending it pretty meturely due to loss of blood  Nah what I really said was ÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆ
4:24  Bryson: STOP TOUCHING ME STOP TOUCHING ME, DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH? STOP TOUCHING ME The doctor: *no*

Bryson: (USES BUTT TO KILL OTHER VIEWER)
Bryson with the funny bone accident is just normally me hitting it on the door from my Fibromyalgia that makes my nerves give me basically the feeling of being frozen in place from any pain whatsoever. My brain gets signals that are so messed up that this is the conversation. "Panic?" Freeze. "Existential Dread?" PFFT, we will make you into a statue. "Hitting the elbow?" *S O L I D I F Y  A R M* I would be the first one to die in a horror movie because of this and that is Not a joke.

I can't thank him enough for placing the skill share ad at the end so I could skip it, and it didn't interrupt anything.
don’t get the nuss surgery if you need it because it will make everything second fucking pain i was filled the the brim with all of the pain medication they had and there was rlly strong shit there and even then i could get away from the pain so if you have a dip in your chest      keep it

Either slamming my toe against a wall or hitting my head on metal roofing (my house got crushed by tree hurricane) this was after.  Now i have broke something before but it was not painful it was my nose
You got a scar across your eyebrow too? I thought I was only one. Basically when I was 5-6 I woke up and went to kitchen. It was so bright for no reason that I couldn't see where I was going and I tripped onto a table corner which cut my eyebrow. Bloody mess it was and honestly I don't know why it was so bright.
I used to have a big bed like a bunk bed bed with a slide and stuf but once when i was sleeping i like fell of it and continued  sleeping
Pain
And its so funny 🤣🤣
Omg its so loud 😭😭😭 ok
Make my comments likes 69
Screw that EMOTIONAL PAIN
The bunk bed one. It caught me off guard. I once jumped down a bunk bed and broke my ankle
Ah yes, kids best game, *FARTNITE*
I have had many "hay frik you" moments I was really young, and I ran straight into the corner of a wall and now I have a scar one my eye brow
Thank The World That Your Drawings Aren't Sloppy From That Door
I'm from a game I'm funtime foxy lolbit has been hitting me should I hit him back
*gets flesh sliced off and then my brain lit on fire* someone: "bruh you didnt even break a bone its not like it could have hurt"
Heres my story: i was playing on my bicycle and fell. Therewas a medium sized cut on my knee and a small injury on my elbow. I had to get those sweet sweet medication juice that they pour it my knee and elbow for like 2 weeks. Another story: the other story probably caused this one, my left leg was kind of disabled for 1 week and a half. I cant walk properly and when i do, its like not to bad but not too good either, its like my leg was in the middle of life and death. I had to do these weird stretches. When it ends, it keeps coming back after  every 2-3 months but its shorter and less painful. But now it never came back. I wonder what injury i will have this year.
You sound like my friend cash hes 12 and i use to play fortnite with him but hes been off for 1 year you remind me of him alot
I have an eyebrow scar tooo!!!!
I was 3 or something and we went to vacantion( me and me family).When i was sleeping i fell uit of me bed and i fell on the stone floor UwU

I'm losing blood an alarming rate and it would be grateful if you my caregiver guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending prematurely due to the loss of blood!!!
Hey I busted my head open my mom was changing my sisters diaper so It took her 30 seconds to realize that I was dying I am sad :( I was four
I have a lot in common with this YouTuber cause I also had to get stitches on my eyebrow and now to have a scar there
I've also never broken a bone but I did scrape the skin of face before
I have sprained my ankle once on my left foot, and cut open my right foot. Also have never broken a bone,but knowing the pain of spraining my ankle (or at least when we found out it was sprained AFTER TWO WEEKS APPARENTLY) I uh don't wanna experience breaking a bone-
I like to snort pixie sticks.
4:30
Worst pain is when I was four and I fell off a playground set hit my head on something dont remember what and a hole was in my head with a bunch of blood (here’s the gross part) I STUCK MY FINGER IN THE HOLEBSIFJWJFJWNFNSNFN it makes me cringe to this day and my hands were literally covered in blood
Skillshare belongs in memory LAME HAHAHA WHAT A ORIGINAL COMMENT CREATOR I AM
Bryson keeps screaming to the 4th dimension

My brother fractured his arm on my skateboard a week ago-
I’ve never broke a bone
Me watching this ow
Once I got my thumb stuck in a car door at a party thing. I locked the door from the inside before I left so I couldn't unlock the door. I also lost my voice so I couldn't tell no matter how hard I tried, we parked so far from the party so they could hear me, I was stuck for like 5 minutes until a kid came up and I told them to get me some help. I still have my thumb but that was terrifying
Bro we both got hit in the head bye a ceiling fand
also one time i broke my head
I remember when my little finger tip was sliced off and it was gushing blood. We had to then clean it and it was all like jello. It burned and I still have a scar
The door hinge one is relatable.  I also have a scar above my left eyebrow.
Edgy people: this vid title is my life Me: I don’t care.
Bruuuhhhhhhhh you use explosions a lot… I like it
at the end you sure could fix that
me when she says your just a friend 0:09
My worst pain was when a glass door fell on me. And apparently I didn't learn my lesson after that because it happened a second time. My parents were scared every time I was around windows or glass doors for years after that
I accidentally put my fingers under a tile. Ahem. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
what happened its been 7 months
I cut my hand with a pocket knife once
Bryson: Your back isn’t supposed to bend like that. Me, a former contortionist: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that
You remind me of @ItzFrolic 20!
i have a scar on top of a scar below a scar and they aren't those "oh yeah i scraped my knee on wood" scars these bitches might be permanent
Does anyone else laugh when their finger gets sliced open? Like from a large piece of glass
bruh the funny bone is a nerve not a bone
Same with me but the door was metal
“Mooom?” “Yes?” “I’m loosing blood at an alarming rate and I would like it if you, my care giver and parent shall transport me to the hospital to heal the wounds so I can go on with out ending my life do to loss of blood. Nah I’m just kidding this is what I actually said. GAHHHHHHHHH”

You know you lived a life of valor when you have/get a eyebrow scar
You're my new comfort YouTuber     I too have slammed my fingers in a door but didn't get taken to the hospital, instead my parents said, and I quote 'is it bleeding, can you move it, how bad does it hurt and does it hurt when I do this' and if it wasn't bleeding and able to move, they said 'you're fine, walk it off' great parenting DAD, I love and cherish my parents and they're the reason I'm here and the person I am today, they were just more chill about things and wanted us to be tough, especially me cause I'm the oldest of 4, am 2 years older than the second demo- I MEAN CHILD, 4 years older than the third and 8 years older than the youngest
Me getting a big scar on my four head when I was 3 or 4 and talk about it with my friend let just call him Kevin.Hey Kevin remember that time that my four head was bleeding!Why didn’t you tell me!?Idk.THATS BECAUSE YOUR DUMB.well your dum because you thought it was juice -.- Oh yeah….I DIDN’T FEEL IT AT ALL  👁👄👁👌
I've had one of those large box TVs fall on my face when I was 4 I remember this because my mom talks about it every 2 months so yea now I have a scar on my lip XD

The only thing that made me hurt soooooo bad is that I was going out of my garage with my pa and the garage door was closing and I jumped up and the door knocked me down and my lip busted and i had to go the hospital 🏥 and get stitches
So one time when I was younger my uncle had one of those things with a little car on a plastic path that you go down hills on but I tried it back wards side ways doing the funky chicken and I was fine until the little brother came he did not come he was at my moms lol

FUNNY BONES ARE NOT FUNNY!

Bryson: "Wow, this door-hinge looks pretty cool. I should put my fingers in there." I literally felt the pain in that moment.
His eyes are like an anime character… you can see them perfectly through hair

I never been seriously injured before...    Thanks, water bucket I've always carried around
I am losing blood at an alarmming rate, so it would be most gratefull if you my care-giver and gardian would transport me to the hospital to help me to heal the wooms, so i can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it pretty much early due to the lost of blood. Nah i wm just kidding what i actually say was GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
aaa
i can learn the word comprehensive at skillshare?

My worst pain:one time, me and my sister Elizabeth (Lil for short) were playing Sonic Colours on the good ol' Wii, then my leg was stuck in the couch, Lil pullet me out, but my leg was broken. Good thing that's over...
This reminds me of JaidenAnimations
Why are people commenting right now even though the video was released 7 months ago
🙂
I was five and I fell on to the side of the road Buy a car and a little bit scratched on me
NOOOOOOOOOOOO not the Mario coins
I've cut my hip and my friend is kinda crazy and tried to strangle me and I passed out and my other friends (Pefferably Jackson) lunged at him and my head hit the fence. And another time I was swinging on a swing and I jumped off and did a backflip but then I forgot that the swing was going pretty fast and I landed on my friends tree base (not a tree house it's on ground) but my hands grabbed it but my grip is the trash can and I fell and hit my back on the wooden fence, and another time I hit my crotch on my shower wall.
I saw this and a few months later I'm at a sky's the limit and I land on my hand and sprain it by my knuckles going to far in the wrong direction and then I get home and that's when the pain REALLY came in
FUN FACT, everytime you damage or break a bone in your body it gets stronger, therefore if we break our bones enough... WE SHALL BECOME IMMORTAL
I was on spinning on a chair then I had an I idea the jump on to the bed the chair was spinning so I jumped I missed the bed and injured my arm AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

One time, me and my brother and sister liked to play wrestling games on our trampoline. So we were on the trampoline, but there was no patting on the sides like a normal trampoline. We liked to throw each other around a lot though, so we got hurt in some ways too like trampoline burns. So one time my brother threw me really hard, then I hit my head on the metal ring that held the net up. At first I thought it was the bump you get when you hit your head on something, then I realized it was BLEEDING and somehow I didn't go to the hospital to get stiches.
My top two worst injuries  Number 1, I was about 6 or 7 when I was doing tricks on my trampoline and I landed a backflip, my ankle went 'nah f//k that' and snapped, I could grown up lopsided  Number 2, I was at a park near my house and the slide there had a long metal bar leading up to the ladder, I slipped off the ladder, and fell onto the metal bar full pelt private area first and then fell off the bar and hit my back on the floor, which, was grass but it was worn down and had those little circle rubber things that hurt if you hit then too fast 😭🤚
the view to sub ratio is abhorrent I mean come on people the sub button is right there Bright red ya' can't miss it

I got hit in the head twice with a plastic toy and I lost a lot of blood and I don't feel pain I hit my head at a wooden pole at a high speed  Not too much pain  I crashed into a motorcycle with my scooter Not too much pain I tripped while holding 2 big glass bottles of soda and lost a lot of blood Pain I feel really sorry for haminations for experiencing a lot of pain Big F

Every time there was a part where he was screaming just made me burst with laughter. Instant subscribe
U think u know pain? I ran on legos then I stepped on a Lego man
The funny bone isn't actually a bone, but a nerve that controlls some hand movements.  Also, I have broken a bone, and the way I did it was RIDING MY BIKE DOWN THE STAIRS AT MACH 2 INTO SEMENT.
Oh you are luck because I fell down a concrete stair case and broke my arm leg and fractured my wrist and broke three of my fingers
My worst hit was when i hit my head at fast speeds at a good dam BENCH and i never got knocked out and this is all when i was 6

My worst injury :  Breaking my wrist than waiting 3 hours in the waiting room--
My dad was fighting with his brother when he was a kid, (like, beating each other up) then somehow hit a brick wall, broke his arm, and made the bone stick out... HE POPPED IT BACK INTO PLACE AND WENT TO HIS DAD AND CALMY TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. he had to get stitches and a cast. My dad is psycho.
Honestly the most pain i ever went through is the time i nearly snapped my fricking neck via ATV crash (i had no equipment) the ATV landed on my head (to keep a long story short i’ll just say, my dad needed me to steer a broken atv he was tugging, he had to swerve, I couldn’t turn in time, bada bing bada boom it landed directly on my head) to be more specific it was a smaller atv for 14 year olds
i put a chair on a bed and got on it when i was 13 and fell and broke my arm also i accidentally slamed a car door on my fingers
I got stung by a bee
Do you know how Bryson was joking because if he got hurt he'd be screaming
Just a small town girl Livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin' anywhere Just a city boy Born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train goin' anywhere A singer in a smokey room The smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile they can share the night It goes on and on, and on, and on Strangers, waitin' Up and down the boulevard Their shadows Searchin' in the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find emotion Hidin' somewhere in the night Workin' hard to get my fill Everybody wants a thrill Payin' anything to roll the dice Just one more time Some will win Some will lose Some were born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on, and on, and on Strangers waitin' Up and down the boulevard Their shadows Searchin' in the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find emotion Hidin' somewhere in the night Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feelin' Streetlight, people Don't stop, believin' Hold on Streetlights, people Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feelin' Streetlight, people

Normal kids if they were to get hit in the face by a fan:WAAAAAAAAAA Bryson: moooooom I'm losing blood and an alarming rate and I be most thankful if you my caregiver and guardian will transport me to the hospital so we can heal the wounds and I can continue this mortal journey rather ending it due to loss of blood
bro i have a scar on my left eyebrow from when i hit my head on a red big metal Circle
I lost my front two teeth by jumping off the top bunk of my bunk bed. My feet got hooked on the metal bar, I swung down and smashed my face in the bottom bar. One tooth crumbled into piece and shattered and I needed to go to the hospital to get the pieces taken out. The other just fell out.

It is nothing i am missing a arm and a leg by a car a lot of bones broken

Me the entire video: do you are have the stupid
I haven’t broke a bone,shattered a bone,but I always hit my funny bone.                The only two severe injuries I’ve ever gotten.  1. I was at a part as a five year old,I was carrying a glass cup while my dad carried me. So I hit the glass cup on the roof and it broke in my right hand. And I got stitches,so now my right hand is deformed and the stitches are clearly visible and my right hand is very weak.  2. I was using the bathroom,while I was washing my hands,I saw my dad’s shaver,so I grab it. And tried to shave my non existent beard,and then a huge cut appeared across my face,and I had a beard,a blood beard
GET DUNKT ONNNNN!!!!!!!!
Wanna know my worst pain? Little old me was so dumb and thought it was a good idea to go into the road- then I slammed my head into a truck and blood was everywhere it sliced my head open and I got it super glued together and it healed now I have a scar
I have gotten my fingers stuck in a car door
It remids me when i was a child i didnt know what physics was and im not saying how but i screamed and my head nearly split in half and for some reason im really stupid now?

not even that long ago I couldn’t eat for days because uh, funny story. i  woke up in the middle of the night, saw that my light was still turned on, so I turned it off but since I am (still) scared of the dark, I wanted to get back into my bed quickly. I jumped. I missed the bed. I threw myself into a wardrobe.

You forgot growing bones its pain for me like heres a free meme Bone: *grows* Me: *suffers in serious pain silently*
I have 2, only one of which left a scar, and sometimes said scar doesn't exist, so here's them both.  My 8 year old cousin threw a hose at my face after I had tossed it at his feet because he wasn't the best at gauging the strength needed to copy what I did.   My other cousin who was 10, was told not to put the pickaxe on the wheelbarrow (we were gardening) because it would roll of and could hurt someone. I was in brand new sandals, and my cousin had put the pickaxe against the wheelbarrow, it rolled off and hit me inbetween my 3rd and 4th toe if you count from your big toe. He got yelled at, and I didn't have to garden, and the pain wasn't that bad once we wrapped it up, so all around it was ok, but not the best. It still really hurt as it healed. But I can't even tell it happened nowadays.
I’ve never broken a bone…but my brother once did!
0:38 pelo would be proud…
Intro was so wholesome but then he just casually fell down freaking mount chiliad from GTA 5
Never broken a bone, but when I was 5 I caught an iron that fell off an ironing board. Right hand, full palm on the metal part. Immediate trip to the doctor's office after running it under cold water.
I also have a scar on my eyebrow it's on my left one and nobody in my entire family neither I remember how I got it
Oh let the bullets fly oh let them raiiiiin My life my love my drive it came from,

0:11 Wow how nice
Bro how does everyone get their eyebrow scars in a non embarrassing way I got mine by falling off the toilet and my dad woke up and there was blood dripping everywhere before my dad could help me he said “hold on let me use the bathroom first” so I was standing there dripping blood watching my dad sit on a toilet pee. This is actually a true story.

You pain is no match for me, because when i was still 6 grade i drive my bike so fast (by the way i was finding my friends house) that i fell from my bike and half of my face was slidding on the ground ( and by the way the ground had a lot of small rocks because its VietNam) including my knee and the whole elbow, and it was cool ( no its not, it hurts a lot, but at least i didn't cry).

3:25 Lmao this happened to me at a hospital once Someone shut the door on my fingers like that and I was scared of making any noise to disturb someone because of my introvert-ism but I eventually did and they put bandages on my fingers and I had bruises on that hand for like a week

0:40 that clap tho
FALLING DOWN BUT I BREAK A BONE
Well one time a car hit me but surprisingly blood didn't just come but I was thrown really fast I was like 8 or 9 years old when that happened and now I'm 12
Title: pain  Me: wow someone guessed my life description
why do you take a check for damage there I saw the blood moooom i’m losing what is an alarming rate I would be grateful if you giver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to heal the wound rather than ending this journey dying due to loss of blood no I’m kidding what I actually said was yaaaaaaaaa
3:55  I reached up and there I saw the blood moooom i’m losing a lot of blood at an alarming rate you my guardian or caregiver should I transport me to the hospital to heal the wound just kidding what I actually said was Aaaaaaaaaaa
" *Memory Pain.* "
I kinda feel your pain I guess  I've been injured many times, broke some things, but all of it has always healed, and for some reason, nothing has left a mark. At all. I've even skinned off half of my face No marks left after it healed, No Scars, nothing.
I actually broke my elbow this week very painful- I now have a cool scar on my knee ✨
Bryson so your life is like this this is confusing
YOUR LIFE IS DIS
Bryson: *sculpt’s the baby’s head*       Me: elf

So story time I never have broken a bone but I have done something almost as worse that still left a memorable scar (probably nobody will believe me because it's way to messed up but i'll still tell anyways) so I was a walking toodle (probably 2 or 3 idk) and my mom and my grandmother was having a conversation while boiling some water to do coffee, I think you can see where this is going, there was a little handle on the thingy that they were using to boil the water, as my mom recalls: I pushed the handle and boiled water fell from my face to my neck and then I passed out because of the pain, of course I was sent to a hospital as fast as possible, long story short the doctors were able to fix the damages on my face, but on my neck, it basically left a scar that it's not very visible today but it was very visible back then, well just like I said way to messed up to believe
pain
Ok but why is it this so funny 😂😂😂
Let's remove the funny bone
And my friend hit my finger with a SWORD even though i holded a ¼ meter long paper strip.
I've had a sprained arm earlier this year that hurt when the arm got the slightest movement. It lasted a month with a sprained left arm just because of a toppled ATV and some snow.
Me trying not to laugh at 23:04 at night
*I'm losing blood at a alarming rate*
So every 2 month haminations adds a new video?
The reason of it being called a funny bone is because other people laugh at your pain
I have broken my bone next to my neck I  almost died

You see that? Your back isn't supposed to do that. That causes a lot of ouchy feelings. Me, a dancer:
I am loosing blood at an alarming rate I would be most grateful if you,my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to heal the wound so I can continue my mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood -Bryson
Worst pain ever: dislocating my leg after jumping off a 15 foot slide getting my hip caught on the fence and being sent to the hospital..... but hey at least I got 150 bucks from it :>
Funny bones are nerves
a TV fell on me when i was  ( it was a sqaure one... not a flat screen ;-;)
Can’t move with what isn’t there
My dog just passed away and you really just made my depression disappear
1:01 y is it called the funny bone it's not funny at all.
One time, i was on a trampoline and me and my friend (6yr) and we  liked to flip and land sitting down on the trampoline, he had one of his other friends over so i was going to show him, but then my brain crashed like a old computer... then i did a backfli- anyway if i breathed the rest of the day it hurt
I have two. First, I was 3 years old and playing on my grandmother's poarch. Being the weird kid I am, I decided to jump OFF the poarch and ended up landing on my face and scaring my eyebrow. Not realizing, I got up and did it yet again. That's where I blacked out, but apparently Mom took me to the hospital and blah blah ect. Second, I was 5 and playing with my cousins. My uncle, (who we rarely see anymore), had a giant unused truck he was trying to fix. Not paying attention to where I was going at the time, I ram my left leg right into the bumper of this thing. Blood gushed everywhere.. I had to get stitches and wear a cast for a week. My scar is still pretty big and still here. Anyway, have a nice day.
Me: falls   Brycen: MY PAIN IS FAR GREATER THEN YOURS!!!!!

Wait dude I have had the same finger injury as you- when i was 8 I was going into my room when i noticed my sister in the door hinge and I poked my finger through there and then my sister slammed the door causing me to scream loud and cry. My finger was left purple for 3 days after that.  It was also hard to even move-
I have a scar on my eyebrow to😀😀

I acctualy never broken a bone to but I have felt maybe even more physical pain than you beacause as a chil my mum called me and I was at my cousin's place in the backyard and when I came running to my mum I sliped and hit my head onto edge of a stair. It hurt like hell and I had to go to the hospital but I was ok after that

You know something (NOT) funny: I was playing on the stairs that had METAL EDGES ON THEM and when I was playing I jumped to reach the stairs and I fell... I fell on to THE METAL EDGES I had a big scar on my forehead and it took almost a month cause it was during pandemic. Luckily I am alive. Now you now how stupid I was.

Me: Sips tea Mmmm  *violence*

Had my hand smushed by a car door at a very young age  Can't remember what happened afterward, but I doubt anything was broken, for the same reason as you    Younger means more flexible bones

Never say: you have never broke a bone you pain is irrelevant! I’m telling you some times breaking bones is better.🌝
If you’ve never experienced pain then the first time you experience pain it’s like getting crossfired in WW2

Bob Bryson I've never been injured before Bryson be like we can fix that!
I am laughing so hard!!!!😂
The worst pain with germophobia is washing your hands so much to the point of stinging hands
Sometimes I forget he's 20 not 12
Funny story as a stupid person I do dumb things one of the was I thought you could repeal down trees with just rope so that's what I did. Not knowing that there was a big rock at the bottom. I let go on accident and I split my head open on the rock. I didn't feel it my friend pointed it out and that's when it all hit at once. And the shock was so bad I forgot how to breathe for a few seconds. And we want to the E.R and I had 14 stitches.
1:51 same that happens to me too but the diffrence is i was smacked by a really strong metal chain like it hit my top head. and then when i checked i thought it was paint but it was blood and i was like AAAAAAAAAA MOMMYYYYYYYY also that was 7 years old me :>
Well technically a funny bone is a nerve that’s why the pain shoots up the side of your arm into your thumb I have hit my funny bone on corners and I can confirm it hurts like a sun of a biatch 🥲
I say don’t break a bone it hurts like hell
falling from The top of the mountain you can’t survive to say AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
When i was young i had two stories I once went under a pingpong table that we had at school and then i hit my head on the corner causing me to get a pretty big hole in my head. I had to get stitches and i still have a lump from where the stitches were I also once was at kindergarten and wanted to go outside To go outside there was a really heavy door wich wasnt hard to open but closed pretty hard I saw somebody go out and the door was closing till i came in and try to push it back open to go outside Well since it did not have any security for it closing slowly it smushed my left ringfinger and my entire nail came off I went to the doctor and had it bandaged for a week and the nail is still odd from the others as the curves way bigger then the others letting you see the underside of my nail Luckily it has grown more normal now and you wont really notice it  Those were my stories of being a stupid kid
Think YOU have it bad, bryson? Fell out of bed, broke toybox (felt no pain somehow) Got shard of glass stuck in my foot for a week Infected leg
Your funny bone is actually a nerve in your arm
The worst pain i felt was a car door shutting by itself onto my thumb and it shut fully surprisingly i think it just m o v e d my bones
What a nice way to begin the video
me: *watching this while i twisted my ankle quite badly*
Nah just kidding,what I actually said was YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH
Why in fuck is it drawn like that?, and how am i kinda liking the face? 4:43
I've never been injured before.
If i need to go to the hospital🏥 I WILL NEVER GO!!!!
Also I cut my self MANY times
One time I got stabbed in the finger with a thumb tack trying to get battery out of a remote and I got stabbed and it went through my bone and it hurt when I moved it
i never got anything past a hair line fracture on one of my arms but i was way to young to remmeber so i got the nose bleeds bruises and cuts that didn't need stitches.....i wonder how painful it is to get a broken bone..........will it stick out?
Guess what i did i jumped off the back of a moving car no bones broken and only a little bit of scrapes and bruises and i cut my collarbone on a rusty Barrel and now i have a scar😅
Fun fact. All serial killers have a head injury in common.
“I am losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caretaker and guardian, would escort me to the nearest hospital to heal my wounds so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.” -Haminations, professional liar.   p.s. i typed this all from memory
Hey Bryson I have never broken a bone but I have a scar on the side of my head and I have sprained things Twisted things and needed stitches so we're kind of the same you and I the scar on the side of my head is from a mysterious origin I have no idea how I got it
At the age of 4 I decided to sit on a pbc pipe and I fell off the table and things happened?
pls 2021
There is 3 clips in this video
3:14 bruh the legit exact same thing happened to me. I was arguing with my sister and put my hand near the door hinge and a bit later my sister slams the door with all her might and luckily it was only my pinky finger, but it was directly on my joint. luckily it wasn't broken but it was purple black and blue. that was painful.
lmao
The intro is what a good guy would do to a bad guy in anime and he would just say: "Thanks for the warmup"
Literally everyone in my school has broken a bone. Everyone tells me ive never felt real pain. Little do they know I have four siblings at home. One being an idiot dare devil who drags me into everything, another who bites, scratches, another who puts me I a choke hold at random times, the other kicks a lot.   I think I should be mentioned they somehow managed to give me THREE scars INSIDE my mouth, from a NERF GUN
2:10
Ham
funny bone isn't a bone btw
i also jumped out of my bunk bed but it my room has no fan [great loss for heat] but i hit my side into my sister bed that was without the mattress and fell into the ground but it was a mild pain so who cares?
All epik Fights 0:38 4:45
You think that hurt try getting yanked out of the car and your head slamming down into rocks and having your had a glass in it and on one day it was too painful for me they had to give me laughing gas

Hey, what app do you use to do your animations? I love your vids!
Most of this video is him being a young dumby
Unharmed bone gang
A few weeks ago I broke my rist in a biking accident
I just noticed hes just Richie rich.
Well, the worst pain I've ever experienced was playing Blind Man's game, I had my headband on and was really sure I had someone right in front of me. That's why I stepped back, prepared my arms to catch someone by the hip, and ran as fast as I could directly against a brick wall, which I hit directly with my head. Surprisingly, I didn't even have to go to the hospital, however the pain was really intense and I could feel the palpitations of my heart in every single cell of my head.
Why does he sound so YOUNG. It’s entertaining
I hade to cut off my head after watching this
I have never been hurt before Bryson: are you sure about that
You slapped them with your butt….
He make every five minutes story I think
Once a tooth pic went an inch into my heel and because the heel is strong it was very hard to take out and I dont know how there waeent a bit of wood left in there and I also broke one of my bones on my left arm and it was very painful
U should be comedian
pain is unbearable
The funny bone isn't an actual bone. It's just that there is no protection of the nerve so getting hit here hurt in a funny way. I'm french and I discovered not a long time ago that we call it.. "Petit juif" which literally mean.. "Little jew" Like wt- Anyway, I guess it was a joke but maybe there are peoples that doesn't know that.. so you're welcome then :)
I remember that time when my dad almost shot me ( like kinda ) on my head because he thought  I was a whole dear and we had to go to the hospital and give me medical stuff and said I will need to re-learn one thing “ How to say the abc” and I did and when I went to home I died
My worst injury was when I impaled my toe with a toothpick sized stick after I tripped on my deck stairs. No seriously you could see both ends through my toe…….
0:49 the same thing has happened to me several times, but with a sharp bit of a saxophone
4:40 I saw this coming :)
Hey what happened when sandman is hurt by fire?  He was in pane.
Dude same i have the pain almost all the time i get hurt🥲🥲🥲😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
After I watched this I broke my big toe
0:40 .
nah my back can do that. Im a flexible little worm
0:22 *”GAME!!”*
I always stub my toe
Just the name is enough to let me know what I’m in for
3:28 is it just me or did anyone else felt pain
i' also forget the bites two dogs
I didn't expect that voice lol
Some 7 year old screams for 5 mins
The back thing acttully happend to me
I came here from the Clips channel, I think it's working for the recommendations. However, I'm mighty disappointed you didn't include the Yoda noise part for the extra out of context funny. Your editing and animation choices are very nice! Good luck!
hi im brian and today im dead
there was this one time i was at school at recces and there is this big dude named pena he was 5 foot 3 at age 7 and i was like 3 foot 4 and all the dudes aka my friends decided that everyone was going to try to fling eachother and someone made the great idea of pairing me up with pena and so me and pena start holding hands and start spinning as fast as we can untill one of us flings and like 8 seconds in i let go and flind halfway across the play ground and hit my fore head straight on a pole at like 50 miles per hour and i didn't feel any pain. well because i was knocked out so i went to the docor and they told me i had a concussion a normal one idk how it wasn't a bad concussion THE END
I cant tell if this is a man, a woman, or a inbetween teenager
Had to pause the video for a sec to cough because of the video. Laugh lv. 9999999999999
Funny...

Thrown into a hole and eaten by a shark, sharks are misunderstood
Bryson, i have noticed you have mysteriously lost your ears since you were a child
If I had the accident with the fan and started screaming my mom would go: "STOP SCREAMING SO FUCKING LOUD! YOU'RE NOT DYING YOU IDIOT!!"   meanwhile me: *ded*
A rock hit my middle finger nail once. The nail was obliterated and fell off (a new nail grew there)
Did anyone else also get their fingers crossed in a doorway or is that just me Also I don’t think my bones were flexible my finger nail came off
I luv the intro dude I’m dead bc of it but in real life that happened to me…………… how am I alive
I got a lot lot lot of scabs
Old me: but Bryson I've never gotten hurt before.  Bryson: well we can fix that Old me: how? Bryson: (grabs golf club and back swings into my head)  Present me: that's how I got a scar right next to my eye (not exactly)

i got a scar across my eyebrow; why bc i was jumping over slinkys and lost friction, slid into a wall and dislocated one of my pinkys and slit open my skin from impacting the corner of my house *when i was in pre-school*
0:40: wtf
3:40 I died laughing at the result and his face.
0:39 yeh but that butt clap tho :3
The intro is so wholesome and cute, so is the animation, but it sometimes gets creepy, the context is hilarious, kinda like Spongebob, but better.
I get hurt almost everyday :)

0:34 I see you learned the ways of the legend: Sr. Pelo
Your voice sounds like a 7 year old
one time i knocked the breath out of myself
Wow   I didn’t know you was that in pain
2 words: Quality Content
The only thing I can think of where I had a big injury, was when I was like, 6.  I took ballet classes as a kid, and because I was 6 years old, I was much shorter than the counter. I would pull myself up by grabbing onto the counter and…pulling myself up.   It was sort of in a jumping form, so it wasn’t arm strength. I just jumped and used my arms as an extra bonus so I could see the lady who was signing me up for classes.    Then, being the idiot child I was.   I hit my head on the very sharp counter.    My mom says that we drove to the fire department to get it all healed up, but I must’ve passed out or something cause all I remember is turning towards what I thought was the nurses office, seeing a doctor, a lot of pain on my forehead, and then going to kindergarten the next day with this cream on my forehead.    I still have the scar and because I used to be SUPER obsessed with Harry Potter, we joked that it was my Harry Potter scar.    And that’s the origin of my fear of counters.  …  What?
2:7  He be spitting facts

If Minecraft have a pain pain
yiyr my 3 fav youtuber
Do you know when you have your bones when you get punched your dad is dead
Well, the argument "you never knew true pain if you didn't have any broken bone" doesn't work on me. I had around 11 broken bones (2 of which were double broken somehow) when I was a kid. The problem was, I had an extreme pain tolerance to the point where when I had broken shoulder bone (or w/e it's called) I didn't know and my parents found out when I was jumping on a trampoline with my left arm flailing like a wet noodle.   Also, the part about soft heads is for real. I have a Minecraft forehead cuz I was like a dumbass running into a wall for fun (cuz I didn't feel any pain remember?).   Yeah, I was not alright when I was a kid...
1:31 i found the perfectly cut scream!

The microwave was really high and I spilt the tea on my face. My face had 3rd degree burns. It hurt like, well me.ting you face off.

I can't tell if he sounds like a guy or a girl
I remember I was running around the driveway to my childhood home, and my mother spoke with our neighbor. Our dog, Bandit was on a chain. But when he saw our neighbor he got excited, and tried running over. The chain was right in my path, and I wasn’t looking where I was stepping.  I fell face first onto the pavement, and had to get held down by my mother and sister at the hospital as I got stitches on my bottom lip and chin. 😅
😂😂😂😂😂
I was once using an air mattress as a slide between my brother and mines beds and I slammed my forehead onto the foot of the bed and i still have a scar there.

i hit my funny bone and it did hurt… a lot but i was just laughing
My name is Bryson and I was creeped out
I’m losing blood at an alarming rate
I broke my arm and it didn't start hurting until an hour had passed which was about when I got in the ambulance and it stopped hurting. More uncomfortable. Fracturing a bone hurts real bad because almost no adrenaline gets released so it hurts alot
0:29😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i was on the floor rolling with that scream
Step 1: find a baby step 2:sculpt The baby’s head

1:32  this kid has got it to good for to long,time to show him who’s in charge.
Never broken a bone but I've been through surgery to remove a infected toenail two times and I might be going again this week
One time I came back from school and went on my parents bed and I got a cutter and a pencil and sharpened it for no reason I while I was sharpening it I was watching TV (don't ask what show) I was too focused on the TV I cut my thumb right I can't remember if there was any pain and went to my grandma and showed her my wound (aaand I forgot) when it was healing I can see in insides of my thumb and eventually its back to normal (sorry for any spelling mistakes)
🤔hmmmmmm ok but your still funny

reminds me of icecreamsandwitch
3:21 i did same thing but worse my brother all most breaks the door when close it so i was so close to cutting my finger off so close that i was bleeding a bit
1:57 love that
Me who also didn’t break a bone just crack it i think : i feel ur pain ( for ppl who didn’t break bones have stuff that hurts them more then a broken bone most of the time so i feel the same way about ppl who say that )
No bones = squid ward dance
When you hit your head on the fan I thought... wait.. I've seen this before and ironically I just watched a skit about you doing that that you posted
That happened to me with the door and I broke 2 of my fingers
“I’ve never broken a bone”-Bryson, me who’s broken 4 bones ;-;
One time I climbed on my bed(I have a double decker bed ) and for some reason i fell off and hit my head on my wall (i have a small room ) and nearly hit a dressing table
1:12 i did just that in february of 2021 also once i was playing tag and kamikazed my head into a plant pot now i have a scar on my forehead that during halloween gives me the nickname harry potter and heres a joke i just made harry POTter
I did the same thing With a fan
When you *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
3:22  I had something similar happen except it was my thumb being in my door
Bonk
One time I was in a birthday of a friend of mine, but when I was like: nothing ain’t gonna happen, then another friend of mine slammed the door and broke my pinky bone, it’s still broken to this time.
Bryson I never broke a bone  me : no fair u never broke a bone when I broke a bone when I was 6 and torn a muscle at the exact same time when I fell off my bike ur lucky
Oh so thats why my pinky didnt break when mom slammed/closed the boot of the car on my pinky finger 3:37
This would be more like pain
Bababooy
Make big hole in a lote hove pain i cri
I hâte mi haed in a starcase at shool
1:11 i had a similar accident like this, but it was with skis(?) my left board somehow detached from the boot and i hadn’t noticed. (This was my first time skiing so it felt like i was doing over 100 mph when really i was doing just above [i think] 10mph) when i put my foot down it dug into the snow and I proceeded to land directly onto my face. Lots of pain, a small cut (yes i was bleeding) and some serious regret.
this kid is 10x more creative 2x more iqs and 300000000000000000000000000000x less pain
This kinda reminded me of ice cream sandwiches hurt video, but this one made me laugh just as hard 😂😅
Of course this is the video with the most screams.
2:30: his brothers turn 2:39: his turn
2:09 big brain kids be like
Fun fact the funny bone isn’t a bone it’s a nerve
One timei shot myself with a airsoft gun and 15000 bbs smashed my foot
Wait how the hell is he able to describe the pain to other types of pain AKA electrical fire 😳
dang he got the sonic ring knock out
1:41 this happend to me but I actually banged into the wall and cracked my head open
My finger got stuck between a door before
My sister left the house cuz my mom is yelling at my sister and my sister was yelling at my mom so she got so mad that my sister left the house but she still visit us sometime
you forgot The T at the end of your video title
big ouch
The title is relatable
The only major injury i ever sustained were cuts to the head. I didn't want to play with my younger brother, so he threw a toy truck at my head which cut it quite badly. The second time was when I was playing fetch with the dog in the garden. I went to pick the ball up but got headbutted directly to the eye socket by the dog instead. Needed stitches for a week afterwards
the Door Slamming that happened to me once at my school😂🙀😱😰😑😐
I did that too and i have cool scrf on my head
0:13 *broken bones VII*
I had a nail through my finger
2:23
"see that? Your back isn't supposed to do that."  Me: wait, it's not?
I love these type of videos you make haminations
The door thing happened with me just with those weird metal doors
that intro basically summarizes the ragdoll physics of breath of the wild
Bryson: wow, getting hurt really sucks!  Every person born in a woman body: Can relate I gess.    Just had to, not sorry.
Bryce and I figure it out I know why you're so short that one snowboarding trip where you scorpion so hard that the board hit the back of your head is the reason why you're so short over the years your body has to fix that problem instead of growing the your back so instead of growing you had to fix your back and bath is why you're so short

Hahhhahah.   Good luck with the job 🤞❤️👌😃
When I was 11 I was running down a path, but there was a super dusty wire hanging in front of me, and since the path was all dirt, I didn't see it until the very last second (I was chewing on a piece of gum at this point). It caught me by the neck, and since I couldn't stop in time, I was pulled off my feet, and when I turned around to break my fall with my hand, that just drove pebbles into my palm (my hand was fine). My hand did nothing and I fell face-first into the dirt. I tasted dirt for a bit, so I spat out the piece of gum I was chewing on, but I realized it had blood on it, so I panicked, ran home and washed most of the blood off my face, and surprisingly, I didn't need stitches, and I didn't even need to go to the hospital
0:40 this frame scares me
I’ve been bitten by a dog, fell off a tree and dislocated my arm when I was really little, and stabbed my hand with a knife while washing the dishes. We are all suffering pain, and God really hates me

I also have a scar of my eyebrow.  I was like- 1-2 years old and I was playing with my older sister. At the time, we had this big coffee table with pretty sharp corners and somehow, I hit my head on it and cut my eyebrow. I think my sister accidentally pushed me since she always blames herself but I have non memory of it so-

Random person: but I never got injured before:  Me who went to the hospital probably more then 12 times But.. that’s impossible. How do you do that thing called “not get injured”?

Fun fact if you actually remove all the bones in your body then one it will be hard for you to breathe cuz you don't have your rib cage do you will die by. And three it's also because you won't be able to eat without your teeth
Haha!

Pain is just my thing as well. I’ve fallen off trees and broke a bone, I’ve been punched by my big sister in the eye, I was stung by a bee cause I tried to eat it, and I sprained my leg so badly that I had to drag it.
Actually I did the finger door thing a lot of time that I don’t feel it anymore when I was 4

Mom! Belle
Another subject about pain that kinda relates to the intro I was biking down a mountain and I saw that I was goin over these small little holes, so I went over one (purposely)      I was fine went over another (purposely)     Went over another another and this was the mega hole and I hit it, and then as if a bird flew down the rest of the hill. Smashed my elbow into a MASSIVE ROCK that was originally on the ground got kicked up, and then my elbow smashed into the ground (with the rock still caught on) and BAM elbow = gone, as if I couldn’t feel it, and from the top of my head to the bottom of my toe (not including my right arm) was SHOCKWAVES I mean light PULSING speeds of pain my elbows skin has been torn off and the rock went flying, like a 4 foot long bloody skid mark was on the ground, my scooter kicked around (which was still in the air this is like not even a second after impact) SMASHED into my back and oh boy, if you think chipping off a toenail was painful imagine missing the skin on your elbow, with skid marks on the floor from dragging on it, and getting a shallow cut in your back.. long story short we never road our bikes down that hill by the school ever again
The medical bills must be crazy
This guy funny

Oh man I loves me some SLEEP JUICE
Isnt pain nice (this is a joke, but i do find pain funny)
funny bones should not eciect
The dreary composition concordantly compete because spoon serologically comb like a omniscient balinese. direful, decisive lamp
another story i have is one i DO actually remember! i was in delaware, on the bay, walking along the sand. i saw my older brother building a sand castle, and i, being the little menace i am, decided to run up to it and stomp it into the ground. HOWEVER, i failed to notice one detail. on the top of his castle, my brother had put a horseshoe crab tail (if you dont know what that looks like, its basically equivalent to a large spike… idk google it) and when i stomped on it IT COMPLETELY IMPALED MY HEEL. it hurt like a motherfucker and i screamed like a little bitch. i dont remember much beyond that except that i cried a shit ton while my dad YANKED IT OUT and i had to walk super weird for the next couple weeks…
hey, ur story about the door reminded me of a similar one i have! i have no memory of this but apparently when i was young, i put my fingers in the door and someone (i dont know who) shut it. the top of my pinkie finger was sliced off! my parents had to rush me to the hospital and i had to get stitches. and now one of my pinkies is shorter than the other! but again, i literally do not remember any of this! so maybe my family was secretly trying to kill me and lied about it to cover it up!!!
That is Painful you shouldn't be Painful like blood when your face memory Pain

Best quotes “I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver or guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wounds so I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood.”
You didn't realize that when you fly when you're dreaming that method you're making a wrong choice then then you're gonna change it right?

3:21        I've  done the same, But with my mum's old  car--- I only saw it coming right as she was abt to close it--(She wasn't agueing with anyone, Just getting me ready for daycare ;~;)                                                                                                                                                                     My nail fell off....
I feel you, last time I checked I had about five scars on my face
🤣😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
haha fune
Btw I've broken my colletbone
Fun fact: Funny bone doesn't exist Its just a bunch of bones in one space around your elbow
Y'all ever got your thumb caught ina door painful shit, Pretty sure half of my nail got broken off.    And no I didn't go to the doctor I live in America where healthcare is a privilege, not a right. My dad just rubbed some neosporin and slapped on a bandaid, then called it a day
To the man that said your pain is irrelevant actually your pain is irrelevant I cracked my head twice
Can someone tell me how many times this man has killed someone??
Me: Ive never hurt myself or gone ro the hospital pls dont kill me
How many times have you been to the hospital
Random kid:But Bryson I’ve never been injured before Bryson: so you have chosen… death
hi mam

1:57 *no one* My brother needing money when i say no*
0:48 does anyone see that word below the for example??
Quick Story one time when I was little my family lived on a Brick road and I was going to my friends house and I tripped. MY LEGS WENT BACK OVER AND INFRONT OF MY HEAD. it still hurts :(
I've never broken a bone, either, but it has felt like I have at some points in my life
I don't know why but my fear became strength one time at the doctor's office when I was 7 and it took 4 doctors to hold me down to get my blood drawn I still remember how even with 4 doctors all of them were still struggling to keep me down on the bed and being the powerful 7 year old I was I ripped my arm up witch slammed one of the doctors nuts into the metal handle of a cabinet freeing it which was a mistake because as soon as one of my arm was free I grabbed the edge of the table I was on and in one swift movement I threw my self off of the table causing all the doctors to loose there hold on me and I bolted out into the hallway and made dash for the door to the lobby but was stopped by another doctor that was helping an old lady down the hall as she simply picked me up and carried me down the hall back to the room as she carried me into the room one doctor was helping the doctor that had his nuts slammed while another was talking to my mom the last one was talking on the phone to the secretary to be on the lookout for me before she brought me in she said if I let them take my blood she would give me one of those crappy ice pops to which I agreed instantly to because I was a stupid dumb little child and as she walked in she looked around at the carnage which had been let loose there were trays laying on the ground with bandaids and needles lying about (from me swatting away any needles anytime they brought one in and once they hit the ground they would become unsanitary so they would go get a new one then I would smack it away again and again and again and the doctors would bring in cotton balls and bandaids to put on where they would draw my blood) she said "sweet Jesus kid" as we walked in and the doctor that I hit in the ball's said "yea I know" and then I got my blood drawn and I got a crappy icepop for it and that's the story of how a 7 year old out powered 4 doctors.
THAT DUMPTRUCKKKKK
4:30 I have a story we’re I got something exactly like this a few years back my sister was messing with me by turning the lights off and hiding to scare me so as the small idiot I was I decided to do that to my mom she was in the dining room at that time so I rushed over to the light switch and ran away as fast as I could into the corner of a wall my head hit it and I don’t even think I got sleepy juice cause I remember it vividly  and I think it was on the left eyebrow
Y e s  G e t  R i d  O f  F u n n y  B o n e s
I'm living in pain known as "life"

Don’t ask what happened
OK here’s a question how many people here have spontaneously combusted I have
"Bryson"... in roblox, i have a friend named Brysonkayne, nicknamed by another couple of friends as Gamer Dad (nickname by: jakebegaming9, approved by his girlfriend codymathewleestacy), its also told that he has a deep voice (take either technoblade or corpse as an example), by my friends obviously and we met in a game of Crossover Sonic (version 3, a rp game that has been abandoned and now stands in the shadow of its older sibling, Sonic Pulse) he's a nice guy and if you come across him or any of his relatives or anything like that, you should get along and if anything happens, just reply to me here | --------------------                      |                      v in the replies, i just wanted to put this here cuz memories and such... also why not.
That hurt me even watching that intro
Plot twist:Bryson has not broke a bone bc bones are stronger than steel.
4:21
In my recommend I got some weird anime saying senpai and ended up here...
Stop the vid and go to 0:49 can you read that

Not going to lie, the injury in the intro looks less painful than the injury shown when he tried flying without a jump rope

Fun fact: the funny bone isn't a bone
I feel like this is a different thumbnail or I just don’t pay attention

I love your videos they’re so cool and funny
You do know that the funny bone is not a bone but a nerve in your elbow.
Hey Bryson if someone bullies you kick their God damn ass
7L
o OW that looks like it hurts
I’m losing blood at a alarming rate and would be most grateful if you if you my caregiver guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending prematurely due to loss of blood   Just kidding what I actually said was   *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
3:50 i love it
my worst injury is one time i fell down while playing basketbal, it was really sandy and it was on concrete, it was so bad i put a bandaid and it fell off 2 seconds later, it healed eventually, we didnt go to the hospital. But heres one thats really bad. So when i was some dumb baby, i had those jumper thingies that you would go inside and just J U M P. so apparently, I was jumping for a long time, and when i finished, i took off my socks because something felt, weird. Apparently, I ripped my nail off. Yes, I RIPPED IT OFF. And many years later, my nail still is deformed. Thanks kid me, ya really didnt cry.

You know what you should do Bryson Make an Audible book you would be great at it
Here’s a story of me being hurt- One time I was at the dealership with my brother and my mom and my dad, we were going to get a new car for my mom and I was playing at the concrete with my brother, and I was running and somehow I tripped and fell on my knee and my knee was bleeding everywhere. Is that a little too excessive?

The funny bone is a nerve not a bone
pain pain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When I was 8 or 7 or something I went up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down up and down and up and down the stairs. and then when I was going down the stairs I fell down and did a barrel roll down the stairs and I smashed my right side of the head onto the concrete floor and suffered a painful misery and went to the hospital and I cried so hard that is was like I was stabbed a million times but still alive just to suffer it. It had a red mark- A BIG red mark for a couple of months but now my head is better. I think I didn't get brain damage from the fall. BTW the stairs were wood. I could've gotten a splinter. I feel like this could relate to the I almost died (3 times) video.
you lucky you have never broken a bone
I hate pain because I have got hurt more then this =(

hah all the scars I have are stupid. I have four scars on my left index finger from doing the same thing four times, whittling a stick towards my finger. I also have two scars on my arm from touching the oven door two separate times, and a scar on my face from a dog I was bothering.
Two stories from me. First Is more recent is when I lifted my hands up and it felt like I chopped my fingers off in the fan. Second was one I don’t remember (prolly had a concussion) is when I pushed a swing hard and just watched it come back and it cut my right above my eye so it bled all over my face and I was super happy just laughing and my mother thought I was really injured.still got the scar
Lol beginning scene he tumbles don’t a hill mountain hill bump mountain thing
The tip of my nose was in between my eyes once
My story: Nobody watches my spongebob. It physically and mentally hurts. I feel my heart aching when the realization hits. I am not desperate. Do not assume, Luke 6:37-42. 37 “Do not judge, and you will not be judged."

Why is called life
My mom had silver pipes in the laundry room. My little brother found them and asked moms permission to cut them apart to make robot arms. She said yes and cut them apart. He used them for a while and put them down. Eventually I found them, put them on my arms and SCREAMED AS LOUD AS I COULD- 😂 But we made the basement the hangout room and now the living room is just a peice of trash and meanwhile we were looking for my phone and we looked in the cabnit in the living room and there was the robot arms. Sitting smug....reminding me.

story time !  So i used to be really good at pogo sticks, i used to be able to do more than 200 jumps ! (fun)  one time i was playing on my pogo stick and the bottom of the pogo stick hit a pebble and it made the pogo stick to backwards. i fell and hit my head and back on the driveway. my mom was like: OH SH- and it all happened so fast i could barley feel my back, im guessing it knocked the breath out of me? i could barley talk and my mum took me inside to help me. later, i FELL off my bed and i was like: … SON OF A-   lesson learned. don’t use a pogo stick on a surface w/ rocks / pebbles
I got stitches on one of my eyebrows too

Hmmm... let me tell you about the story of how I lost 4 parts of my skin     So this was in 1st grade. Almost at the end of the school day. We all ran out of the class and went to the playground. Everyone was running (so was i) so fast the made me fell and scratch my elbow and knees. The teacher saw that I fell and put me to the side and made me sit to the wall right next to her (COULD OF TAKE ME TO FHE CILNIC). So I had to wait until the day was over and I could go home. Man that was awful

Ok interesting  Welp, I'm hitting my head often First time I hit my head was when I was 1 year old or younger. My dad was carrying me in his arms in a "flying" style. (like this: OvO/- /-  if you understand anything of that lol) so anyways he was carrying me high and then he tried to carry me through a doorway (it didn't have door tho) and I hit my head to the top of the doorway. (I don't speak English so I hope you understood) but anyways, now I hit my head often. 😅

I was about 3 or 4 years old, in our old house, I put my mother’s slippers on and wen’t outside, before my feet were small, and the slippers were big, so naturally, I slipped and fell down our steps. My nose bled. 2. Same thing but far into 4 years old, I wore my fathers boots… I fell and at the bottom both boots hit me in the face. 3. I was 5, still in our old house, I was going inside after swimming to go to the bathroom, I came back out and I slipped on the water, this time the back of my head bled and my nose did too. So there’s my pain, btw this is my mother’s acc.

What are you pain from Naruto 😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The little bald spot basically happens when a human endures a lot of trauma and physical pain, it most likely hurt a fuck ton when you rammed your head into the basketball hoop, so you got a little patch of bald on your head, i also endured a lot of physical pain in an instant one time when I crashed into 3 trees and broke most of the bones in my body, when I got to the hospital I was completely  bald. (Not sure if it happened when I got to the hospital, might have been a few days after, I was in a coma for a a month after this happened.)
0:01  That reminds me of the roblox game called broken bones-

In 6th Graf is was playing with my friends at lunch and I ran into a metal pole and that snapped my tooth in half broke my nose and twisted some of my teeth (there was a lot of blood) anyway I went home early 😎 and my mum tuck me to the hospital anyway like 5 WEEKS LATER THEY FINALY FIXED MY NOSE but then a week after that I went the dentist and it turned out that the toothy that snapped In half was not DEAD and was trying to kill all my other teeth and they got rid of the half that was broke but that didn’t help so the moral of the story is DONT TRUST POLES 😡😩 anyway I was chill about it all except the bit we’re I ran into the pole I was screaming and crying for 20 minutes and as I said before the moral of the story is don’t trust poles

One time when it was winter in Wisconsin we were close to the beach and there was a huge hill, like prop taller than god himself. anyway we only had one sled in the back of the truck and my mom said “you can go sled down the hill” I was like: Heck no and yeah at the same time. Before I walked out to go sledding down the hill taller that god himself my brother Emilio sled down and didn’t get hurt. And I was all up and like: IM SLEDDING DOWN NOW so I climbed the hill taller that god himself and got the sled ready (it was that green kinda-flat diamond shaped sleds) I sled down and the worst of the rocks a little hill was on the hill bigger that god himself I was closing my eyes while I was going down and I went on the little slope and...I WAS LITERALLY IN THE HECKN SKY I didn’t now at the time but then when I hit the ground the sled was in the snow and it flinged me like a trampoline then I rolled down the hill taller than god himself and did 3 FRONT FLIPS WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING (the third flop was a summersalt) anyway when I was in the snow I started crying I didn’t feel it at the time but I had a bloody lip. No I did not go to the hospital and this is my pain experience from the hill taller than god himself

One of my most painful thing was: my and my brother were outside and my mom had bought us a new mattress so the new one went outside while they were moving the old one so me and my brother said let’s jump on it and it was leaned against the wall so I pull it down slowly and I try holding it up to be cool when I lost balance when it slammed my head against the stone wall
are we not gonna talk about y bryson just kills people on the street in  front of his house
I have fighting class and almost broke my bone 👹
I will never be able to stop me from pain and I hope u r luck
Stop the killing.
Your an idiot but this is still hilarious
ITS-A-ME, M A R I O

This is relatable to me
I was at a state park and i was being smooth brain and i did a thing and face planted into the concrete and that caused my two front teeth to go through my top lip, i literally had a hole in my lip, and again this just crossed my mind and i wanted to say it, it is not meant for sympathy or to brag i just wanted to say it and again pls no be mean to me
Did you have Staples in YOUR head I did and now I have a bald spot

Oh oh oh ow my back
Once experience I had with pain that I was leaving my mum’s car and then when you close your door the the first rule to never break is to slam the door on your finger and I did not know my finger was in the way and then SLAM! Then I feel a instant shock of pain floods my entire hand and my nail was at the centre of where it happen so after a few weeks or months I believe that my nail got crushed so hard that my nail had to fall off after a months my nail grown back to this day it still shows its all messed up so my nail is messed up and that’s my story of having my finger crushed by a car door
Qoo skao 1lqqpqpqll
I got a sink spot on my head
bryson's combo: kick in the chest, very big punch, slap,  smash with a big hand, kick, bootay press, break neck , grab him and slap up and down. what a good combo

When I was in I think 4th grade and I was practicing softball with my dad and my sister, when I batted I swung the bat wrong and hit my middle finger so I had to make sure I didn’t have an infection, I didn’t have an infection, just dirt and a middle finger in pain

holy shit the hand thing happened to my brother too, his hand was crushed in a door hinge after an argument, and his fingers were all fucked up, and then they kind of just went back to normal
I broken my thumb before
4:22
Omg I can relate to when you hit the fan so I was a kid when this happened and me and my brother were fighting and he threw a metal flashlight at my eye and I fell on the ground acting unconscious and it hurt and my brain said it ain't that bad I kid u not in a matter of seconds half of my face was covered in blood lol
Pain is so painfull
I once was throwing a toy tomato in the air right by an open door, I got up too fast and the doorknob demolished my skull. (not really) If blood didn't exist I would have not freaked out as much. (This happened when I was 5 years old.)
1:10 MAMA MIA! SPAGHETTI! Lol
haha what a clown you almost ided XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD (joke)
I can’t go anywhere without getting hurt
1:39 BRYSON WTH IS HAPPENING?!
I watched every hamination videos and they are awesome
In my family we just fight echother
Seeing this video makes me feel happy about having asperger síndrome
I never broke a bone I think I sprain d my finge tho
You should get your back checked. After the cartilage gets damaged it never comes back, thus beginning a long and painful process of some of your spine fusing together.
1:15 my snowboard hit my back Ehmm maybe legs???
If u get pain u will drop lego money
This man is crazy if my brother slams the door at my hand my bones are broken
Hahaahahahahahahahhahahaa😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆

22 days ago I fell off a bed and my funny bone was hit, I WAS SCREAMING IN ETERNAL PAIN A_
A few days ago I fell and there was blood all over my face and now I have a little bump on my lip
One time I burnt my hand
I have 4 injuries  right now lol
I slammed my brothers fingers he had to get stitches.
Fun fact:IM LITTERLY CRYING FROM DIS VIDEO.😂😂😭
Rrtr
Same thing with the fingers but I’m older and it was with a car door
Tje worst injury i've ever had was that i slipped in a bathroom and banged my fave on the doorknob, i had to get six stitches and i almost lost my eye. :D
One time i fell face first on concrete, and my tounge was bleeding like crazy, and my head needed an ice pack.
0:37 - 0:45 :  1:40 - 2:24 3:40 - 3:51 This chanel is so funny😎👌🏼😂🤣
I used to do BMX and once I crashed on my funny bone then when my dad tried to help me up he picked me up by my arm and my nervous system went brrrr.
When I was Young I try to jump on the flying fox but I was small and I broke my arm and I cried In pain and I still remember that day
I once got hit in balls with a metal leash.
The screaming memes are so FUNNY!
2 years ago: didn’t break a thing  This year: fractures tip of thumb and has to regrow nail because I slammed it in a gate
The intro reminds me of s c h o o l
6: When my head gets slammed into the wall
5: when my friend slams me into the door like that when I was literally just trying to find my rubber band in there and all of a sudden smash the like jelly
At third hurt: that’s what I be like when I hit my head when the fan is on when I am trying to hold onto it and I absolutely just hit my head on the wall and then I broke my head like an egg
Add a third hurt when you asked your mom:That’s what I’ll be like when you hit a fan at 20,000 miles an hour a.k.a. when you tell your mom
hm this is the most popular video on his channel, so pain is how to make money.
Bryson:screams like a girl Me:do you scream like 5hat
My mom mom says I look 5 but I’m 10
wow Bryson's first video that reached 10 million views
I remember getting hit by a soccer ball in my face didn’t break any bones though but did get some jello for free at my school
4:30 I’m a tired (every day LOL)
So stop saying bad words!
My mom and dad don't like bad words
I want to be a scientist
I'm Michael and a long time I fell and then my eyebrow started to bleed
One time, me and my twin brother were playing with this massive branch in our front yard and he accidentally hit me with it so hard and so fast that it didn’t even hurt, although I DID feel a little sore, and my brother said that I was bleeding really badly. To make sure that he wasn’t lying, I put my hand on my head and checked if there was blood, and there was. I didn’t know how bad that I was hurt, and my brother isn’t exactly a reliable speaker, so I went to my mom to check. Turns out, I had a MASSIVE gash on my forehead and had to get stitches. The spot is still sore and somewhat of an “Achilles’ heel”, just above my right eyebrow. Also, I’ve only broken a bone ONCE. Let me tell you, it hurts A LOT. Your lucky that you didn’t break a bone, but holy crap you’ve been hurt a lot, so in a sense I’M the lucky one.
I almost broke my leg like 3/4 months
I broke my

The lego coins got me that was so funny

I had a lot of PAIN before and I still have it
One time when I was sleeping then I fell off hit something then fell on my face on the rock hard floor and I was screaming and the whole universe heard it
The door part was the same thing that happened to me but it was my thumb and I had to get stitches
One time I was on the top of a playground and I feel off and I hit my head on the bark
Your not the only one who jumped off the top of their bunk bed to not take an hour climbing down your ladder and then instantly regret it
I have also busted my eyebrow! Except mine was on the opposite side, and its a bit more embarrassing. I fell out of a car seat when I was one year old and I busted my eyebrow on the side of the car...
Soooo when you said baby’s wear helmets. Ummmmm i think I may have done that.  For 2 years

I have broken, dislocated, and fractured my arm all in one by falling awkwardly from a haybale. You, my good sir, are lucky. (P.S. Hey, blonde haired girl with blue eyes who was wearing jeans, a lavender t-shirt, and a matching scrunchie with your hair in a ponytail at the county fair autumn who pushed me off the hay bale while trying to tag me, I hold no grudges against you :D)

Bruh when he said he jumped of the top of the bunk I felt it  I did it as a kid when I dropped a toy from the top bunk so I stupidly jumped to get it instead of using the ladder and snapped my arm backwards (I was like 6)
Breaking a bone isn't that bad

0:22  When you stub you toe
a person: *"are u 10? 😂😂"* Haminations: *I'm 20 so shut up*
I once got my fingers shut in a car door and somehow my fingers didn't break they were just swollen
Bryson: S H E I S N ‘ T C O M M I N G B A C K me: sounds good to me I killed my birds before y not my ex who hates me
in a short time space he looks like idiot :~|
Um I found every funny bone that hard way
Once my brother was running to the door and slammed it and I thought the glass would not break but.... I saw it slit open and blood. E V E R Y W H E R E. So I screamed and I felt like passing out. I threw up and I had to hold up my hand for 10 minutes until we got to the doctors.(Pls tell me the thing that paralyzes you for a little bit.) So when we got home my Nana was still cleaning up the glass and she showed me the glass shard that slit my hand. I was upstairs watching stuff (as usual lol) I almost cut a nerve open. Now I have a big scar that look EXACTLY like moms. I was going to sleep and then it all of a sudden hurt real bad. I called nana and she said "put it on a pillow. We will wash up tomorrow." I got good vibes and everything is okay to this day.  Edit: dang I didn't know I wrote this much 😳
You are so funny

Hi Bryson, I decided to make a character similar to your Ham, his name is Nog.
😂😂😂👏👍
I went snowboarding and I fell on a bump of snow made by skiers. Since I was going so fast, I flew at least four feet in the air and slid 20 feet down the hill. And then the same thing happened to me that happened to Bryson but it was a bit lighter. I’m not exaggerating how high and far I flew. If it was that, it was more.
I used to have to go to memory pain in memory lane but the most is memory pain
"hey this door hinge looks pretty cool"

i broke my funny bone sooo
I've been injured100 times
so when i was younger, i used to pull my dad down slopes and run. one time, we were dogsitting me dad's friend's huge dog. we were on a walk and we came to the slope i run down all the time. my dad insisted that i pulled the dog instead and being the dumb little gremlin i was, i listened. the dog saw me running and decided to run with me. excet he was way faster and stronger than me and pulled me down the slope. i fell and ended up somersaulting the whole way down. still traumatized

Around 3 or 4 years ago, I played softball. And it is was time that I had to practice catching and throwing. So I partnered with my friend, Claire. when she went to throw the ball, I was about to catch it, *But no.* The softball hit my lip, busting it open, and there was blood on my hands, shirt and (of course) mouth. And I screamed and cried for a long time, and my bottom lip screamed to. *of pain* And I remember that it had hurt more than falling 500,000,000 miles and landing on concrete.
I FEEL LIKE THAT BABY IS ICE CREAM CAUSE HIS HEAD 3:51

I felt to pain. Once when I was 4-5 I was being babysittied by my cousin girlfriend.we were at the park with mah sis and there were those spin type of swings that you have to push. Well my cousin girl was pushing me and my sis on da swing and she was pushing so fast my hands started to slip from the chain of the swing but,I didn't say anything cuz I was shy-ish. She kept going and I kept slipping until I couldn't hold no more. I had my eyes closed until I realized I was 20 FEET FLYING IN THE AIR. I began to fall near the playground borders and I was ether gonna hit the border, the grass, or in the sand...I hit the grass...face forward. I think I got a little bit of brain damage cuz now I forget alot. But I wasn't bleeding for some reason.i was confused but my cousin girlfriend asked if I was ok and I was crying until she asked did we want to go to McDonald's and I stopped instantly and das it🤣😥😔

I once got hit on the head by a really thick wooden basketball goal when I was like 6 or 7.. I remember getting hit, and I remember my pastor at the time praying for me.. but I barely remember anything else. I don't even remember walking to the church to get prayed for. Also around that same time, my mom was talking on the phone, so I decided I wanted to mow the yard, but there was a little stump, and I ran into it, and my nose ran into the handle on the mower.. and the cartilage on my nose decided it was time to split (pun intended) And then a few months ago, I got the bright idea to clean balogna from a meat slicer at work while it was still on.. split the skin and muscle tissue on my index finger.. like perfectly in the center of the bend... I was just like "So.... uh... Yeah... I'm not going to be able to finish cutting your meat... I uh... kind of cut myself...". Dude just stared at my finger, grabbed his cart, and walked away.
You got a cut on your eyebrow me too

I remember this time when I was in lake Tahoe ,  I was on the top bunk (cousin on the bottom one) and I was just falling backwards onto a pillow, and at some point, I fell on it so hard I bounced off the wall and the pillow, hit the small fence on the top bunk, went right over it, and came crashing onto the floor. after that I just went: ...........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
so I see another has unbreakable bones, well played

Hello, is his name Bryson~?
His experience with smashnbros is wild.
4:06 I was honestly expecting the punching bag to come back and smacc him
one time I was skiing and I was on the final stretch to the main hub thing, It was dark and I saw the light of the place so I took what I saw as a shortcut and went directly to the hub, it turns out it was actually a turn and I had collided with the snowbank and at first nothing happened then I went into a frontflip because my skis caught something, I did a full flip and then landed, my ankle did not break but got a chip-fracture, and this was all in Campbellton, New Brunswick. there was an awesome pool there and I could not swim for the whole rest of the trip because of that.
FUNNIEST PART: 1:36

The last one, I have had a slightly relatable story. I was at a park down the street, and I was as the money bars. I usually jump to the 4/5 bar instead of doing it one by one. Now this one time I tried, i jumped out, tried catching the bar, but I missed. And then I flew though the air, and I slammed my head into a metal pole, and almost got a concussion.
I just realized that your pain is pointless and the people you have killed have more pain
Do you know that Scar across your eyebrow I have one to instead of it going up mine goes left to right
your videos are so funny! XD

“i wouldn’t let them clean the wound” i feel u bro wipes on a cut feel like *hecc*
I love how there's a video just called "Pain"
How do you get the link
The door story reminded me of this story. My little brother had his fingers in a door then 2 of my sisters slammed the door(not knowing his fingers were there) and it literally chopped the very tip top of his finger off and accually took a nick out his bone too, the tip of his finger was hanging on by a thread of skin so the doctors were able to sew it back on but now he has a weird skin bubble thing where it came off.
2:42
i got hurt when i put my finger in the door it happen 2 or 3
I have a story for u. So, one time in school (without the pandemic) I was 7 years old, and I was running to to play on the monkey bars and slipped, and then I looked and it was bleeding a lot . so I was like I’m fine it does not hurt. Then a kid in 1st grade said “you are bleeding a lot” I was like I know. Then she said “you should talk to a teacher to go to the nurses office”  so I said ok then, went to the monitor for recess and I said “can I go to the nurse?” The monitor said “sure honey” as it was bleeding on my leg. So then there was the MEAN nurse who said “how did this happen?” I said nothing and thinking how it did trying to not get in trouble for running and not walking! Then the nurse said it again more angry then yelled and said “TELL ME RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENED!” So I was crying because I don’t talk and always the quiet kid in class and not paying attention all the time so then put a bandage on my knee and sent me out. But the nice nurse will wait and ask again nicely so I paid attention. Hoped you liked it.
The scorpion is the logo of ridiculousness.
0:33  *me watching with a broken wrist*
*slam the door with finger in the door* Me: I feel your pain, it hurt like H###
I slammed my fingers in the car door and they also didn't break.
OMG it’s So Funny  😂
I feel you man I too have a scar above my eyebrow
I've never broken a bone... but I did get boiling water from a thermos splashed over my lap. Had to go to the hospital since it caused 1st and 2nd degree burns over my entire left thigh and part of my right. That was probably the most pain I've been in... and yet the hospital only gave me IBUPOFEN. And that was after an hour of being there when they finally asked me, "do you want some medication to help with the pain?"  O_o I was holding screams, like bitch YES
The first time I watched this video I died 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 in laughter
i smashed my thumb in to a car door and doctor had to peice my nail in to my thumb to let the blood flow away. it hurt a lot but at least i dont have to live with painfilled purple thumb

When I was 5 I grabbed on to my cousins arm and my head was next to a sharp corner wall and in just 2 seconds my head shot back my head hit the wall so hard it chipped it. Lucky enough I had a really hard head so I didn’t die. I was bleeding a lot and my hand was covered in blood I went to the hospital and instead of putting stitches they put staples for the body. But it’s all good now.

That’s my only near death experience.
Do you exist?
Bonus story: so once I was on a vacation recently, and it was super late when we arrived. Then we slept (I’m saying we, because i was with my mother and father.) and the next day we went shopping, met up with my brother two times, (we went to the state my brother was at) and then we were gonna sleep, but I wanted to swim but I can’t swim, so I went in the deep end. And my mom thought I was joking at first, but this is real. My mom said my name two times, no response. And she jumped in and saved me, so if it wasn’t to my mom I wouldn’t be saying this, thanks mom :) p.s this the end I will not edit
(This is my first video I watched of you) My first thought: how young is this guy?
I once fell off the bed onto a mini ipad and my nee  got a gash or a open wound it was a circle cut not a round one it was traumatic because it looked disgusting but surprisingly it didnt hurt or it hurt so badly that i the pain wasnt there but it was very traumatic im traumatized
Committing violent acts is comedy
what happen to your funny bone is what it is like breaking your arm but every time you move your arm it happens again and hurts more

I smacked my head before
0:40 so funny lololol
Bryson's video editors be like: what add on would you like for 0:42? Bryson: like in all of my videos, *FIRE EXPLOSION*
It's funny to me how you can't break a toddler's skin very easy, you could snap all their boned in halve and not a drop of blood
pure pain does not mean broken legs and arms, it can be something totally different
that subtitle gave me a weird shiver down my spine
3:25 SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME IN OUR OLD HOUSE I HADDA GET MY FINGER STICHED LOL
i imagine that when you "kill" someone in a video transform into your final smash. 🤣

Pain is when your teacher tells you to do extra homework:
Do the first one was when I got tumbled down the stairs with a brick staircase and it hurt really bad it damage my head and my nose
I have only two moments  where i was reminded i was mortal once i was one one of the things where someone can push you and your off the ground after they do it for a little and then you get to another platform (btw the platforms where steel at this park) my mom pushed me alot to hard and let go and i went flying couldnt hold on and my face was slammed into the steel platform my nose took the most damage and for a second we thought it was broken (by we i mean my entire family) it wasnt but it still hurt ALOT and another one (this was before the nose accident) i was kicking my bunk bed up and down cause i was bottom bunk and the top bunk gave out and fell on me i screamed for over 5 minutes but it felt like an hour welp thats all ive got that reminded me of my mortality
Relatable title
Bryson. Cartoon bryson ALMOST CUT MY HEAD OFF

I broke my Bonę yesterday
One time (I was FUCKING stupid at the time) i was trying to do backflips for some unexplainable reason in my parents room, and he had this chest kind of thing near me, i almost did it.. and then hit my head on the corner, i fell down and felt nothing for some reason, a second later i see blood, i touch my head, and no joke i looked at the blood and thought (Fuck. Keep in mind i wasn't crying it happened so fast i didn't know what had happened) i got up and went to the kitchen where everyone was and i slowly start cry a bit (Moom. Daad, I'm bleeding) the thing is i wasn't balling my eye's out for some reason i was calm, so fucking calm everyone laughed and my dad took me to the ER, it still confuses me to this day

How come I only come across this channel now? This is briliant
One time i was at the park on my bike, and we were riding down a huge hill and i went down on my bike so fast, that i forgot how to use my brakes. Then i swerved right and flew over the handlebars. I landed on the back of my head on the black top and they was a large crack. Suprisingly, nothing was broken, but it hurt a little bit. There was also this time i got hit in the face by a baseball in the eye and also didnt break anything.
You wanna get your ex girlfriend back? Well too bad she isn't coming back buddy

one time when i was 4-5 (?) and i went to my moms friend birthday for their kid. So everyone was around the pinata (is that how you spell it?) And we were 3 feet away since they didnt have a bat. They used a 3 feet metal pole. Short summary i got close and probably broke my nose or fractured it. *my first time going to the hospital..*

I like how the sigh said Funny bone bad>:(
HE CLAPPED HIM WITH HIS BUTT LOL

3:25 When I was in the 1st grade, a kid in my class accidentally(I assume, probably was something like this though)closed the bathroom door on one of his pointer fingers. The bathroom doors at the elementary school I went to didn’t really just closed, if you weren’t purposely closing it slowly, they slammed shut- so you can just imagine a bunch of 1st graders, staring at this kid with his finger seemingly bent backwards from being dislocated, dripping blood while being escorted out of the classroom to the nurses office by my very panicked teacher— That was a fun day-
Bryson your so funny you make me laugh so hard! Please make more videos
Yes pain
And I hope your ok
Hey Bryson did all of that really happen?! And I’m a girl mind me!
I am convinced we are the same person
My emotion
Guess what in high school I nearly stabbed myself with an axe and fractured my knee
Ripping a ligament or dislocating a joint is more painful then breaking a bone
Hami:  *meme master* Hami again: gO sEe sKil sHaRe

Once me and some other kids ended up becoming a human domino chain, no one was severely hurt....*except me.* I slammed into the concrete wall of everyone's favorite place the school gym, my glasses (yes I wear glasses) ended up making a deep cut into my face, and I walked out with blood running down half my face. :)

Broke my arm about 2 weeks ago can say that the most painful part is waiting two hours in the waiting room just clutching your arm. After that it's just a big inconvenience.

And  I fell of a bunk bed
my name is bryce
interesting i popped my forehead open when i was wee too. but in my case it was by diving after a softball my bro threw at the wall, and didn't even hit the wall but the wooden side thingie the bed i was throwing myself onto had. same outcome though.

Watching this video weirdly reminds me of my childhood. A lot of the injuries he said happened to him were similar to what happened to me, like when I was around 8 and I decided I would run head first into the corner of the island in our kitchen and I SHATTERED IT! my head was fine but I broke the tile into pieces

Never went to the hospital when I was young but the worst injury I had was when I tripped on someone in the gym while running so then my head bounced off the ground like 3 times on the gym floor. I was like one more bounce close to getting stitches but the bounces left a lump on my head for about 3 years
Ok typically im not a fan of story time animation but this shit made me laugh keep up da beautiful work
This was the first hamimations video I saw

Brycen falls off cliff in game. what I see: Brycen was the smartest at getting hurt so he hurt himself but never broke any bones. Right after this: Brycen fell from a high place whilst fighting his school education. Bad way to die.

Fun fact: the reason they call it the funny bone is because it’s actually called the humerus pronounced (hugh-mer-us) bone, but people mistake it for the word humorous so they now call it the funny bone.
The one where your fingers broke from the door actually happened to me once and i needed bandages
When you hit your funny bone very very bad, it feels like its been dunked in lava.

I didn't get taken by an ambulance but the had it wait outside for some reason because i started breathing again but i couldn't move  and they asked if i was in pain. 3:27 + swearing

I had nasal surgery. But My nose kept bleeding afterwards.  So  The doctor shoved a bunch of sh*t in there while I was still awake, trying to make it stop. I began bleeding all over my face. Over my eyes. In my mouth. Down my throat. It was the worst pain in my life.  I went into shock. I lost tons of blood. i was rushed into the emergency room. I stayed there over several nights.   I’m still paying off my medical bills. Even though my insurance paid for 90% of it. Honestly. I kinda wish the doctor could have helped pay for the damages he did to my nose. But… Im too poor.
Haha
Mac 10 got me too good

He got folded very hard and the fact he did the butt slap and crack that arm and smile and the sledge hammer in the back and that pet randomly came he gonna kill him
Mom: baby why are you holding a hammer? Me: I’m smashing the like button
The aware mayonnaise radiologically beg because vegetarian reassembly slap about a gleaming desk. intelligent, lovely castanet
Why the Drake meme though???
Ok, I can definitely relate to the snowboarding thing except I did that and roll down a forest. It hurt. A lot.
Funny bones are actually nerves
haination a am a huge fan
*Why does pain exist*
Falls down mountain also me thinking about the one time I fell down the stairs 🤣
You have only experienced pain if you have ever stubbed your pinky toe or hit your funny bone on something
Intro starts  Bryson  and falls off a cliff That’s the  definition of me because that’s just my luck
I don’t wanna be dumb annoying stupid idiotic and cringe(stuff I all am) but yo funny bone isn’t a bone lol Issa Muscle
"You know what doesn't suck?"  *RAID SHADOW LEGENDS*
Bruh you need to pay 💰 nope nope
I'm 90% sure I don't have bones. I've smashed my face open and was fine. I got hit by a car going mach 60 while going like mach 10 on a bike and got launched at like 100 miles per right into the curb arm first and i just stood up and was like. I think we need to go to the hospital cause I just hit by a car but nothing was wrong except a bad bruise and everyone was confused. Fun times. And I've been impaled. I've stabbed my arm. I fell down a steep hill right into a light poll and it just hurt a lot. My foot was run over by my brother on a bike. I've been knocked out by a bike. I got hit in the chest by a baseball. How am I alive...
funny bone more like unfunny bone underlate
Why are you up there that's a mountain

I broke a bone before😁😅
This video is: 1% animation and 99% screaming
Bryson: your bones are still soft and squishy when you’re younger Me: fractured my arm when I was four-.-
Breaking news Bryson wanted for very mass murder
Why is there a stick figure right over there and just says mean words it and then you beat them up
No wonder your so uh less tall is because you kept getting hit in the head

0:43 Is no one going to talk about how he caused an explosion by slamming some random person on the ground multiple times?
this reminded me of memory pain. 1: almost choke to death via cord at birth 2: almost died from large intestant blocking 3: almost died of appendix 4: go really hurt when my finger got slammed in a door

I have a scar on my head, 1 am 14 and I got the scar at 6-7. I did not feel anything when I had the open hit, but everyone said that it was just a huge gaping hole on my forehead. Assuming the size of it now, it was about the size of 2 or 1 1/2 (I am American) Hot Wheels monster truck wheels.

0:40 this should be a new attack for thicc girls on street fighter or on mortal combat hahahahahah
Wow thats crazy i have stitches on my eyebrow too
SO THATS WHY WHEN MY RIST WAS SLAMMED ON A CAR DOOR IT DIDNT BREAK
Oh wow, the part with the fingers and door happened with my sister
One time I was at a house for Thanksgiving then when I tried to push the chair forward so I'm closer to the table the seat went up then my nail was under the thing where you sit it happend fast that I couldn't fo anything then when I pulled my finger out my nail was bleeding and then like 5 or 6 months later my nail fell off I was glad and now I have a new nail also yesterday I got cut with plastic and now it hurts damn WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO MEEEEE
I have also gotten my fingers SMASHED I felt like..
When I was four years old, I was playing with some toys at the dinner table. My mom said it was bedtime, so I picked my toys up and tried to get up off of the chair to put them away and then go to bed. What ended up happening was the chair giving way as I was getting up and me falling onto the floor really hard. Hard enough to rip part of my bottom lip off. And rip part of my bottom lip off it did, as I started crying and my dad drove me to the hospital. It was nothing serious and I got a popsicle at the end, but it was like the time I accidentally stabbed myself with a knife multiplied by the time I accidentally stabbed myself with my pinky nail, but in my mouth instead of in my fingers.
If you never got injured once as a child you definately grew up to be a big snowflake
My sis slammed my finger on a door to
I’m dieing because it is so funny how you describe it

I ALSO GOT A SCAR ACROSS MY EYEBROW!!! I was 4 years old at the local express lane when i tripped and hit my head on the edge of the curb. I thought i died but somehow i lived
Fun fact:pain is actually a warning to not do it again         It's not you're funny bones it's the pain receptors so if you cut it out you would feel no pain
I've never broken a bone before but I've gotten massive cuts and sprained and twisted a bunch of stuff. And dislocated stuff as well

The hinge was relatable. I put my thumb on the corner of the wooden door. It closed into my finger and it broke my skin. Suprisingly, no blood came out, just really messed up skin lumps. It was terrifying. So when i saw him saying: this hinge looks cool, i was thinking: NO, DONT DO IT!! in my head.
0:59 AAAAAAAAAAAAA

An appreciation for mortality is withering away, very unique feeling, also my bowels disintegrating as well, not saying your pain is lesser than mine, what i am saying is, one does not contemplate mortality until they feel themselves dying, i did it thrice
I like his sense of humour

Story time on how I almost broke my hips It was friday  so my mum let me play at the playground near my school and me and two of my other friends we’re sliding down a really big slide and we had a brilliant idea to slide down while hugging eachothers backs it went good for a little while until when I was at the back of the hug and the kid infront of me shifted himself and while was latched on to him and so I fell of the slide (which was very tall) and I proceeded to cry all the way home and I felt bad for the kid because he got scolded when he went home
Just pain
The start show something that's supposed to be painful but that's just death

I am losing blood at a alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so I can continue this mortal journey and not having to end it prematurely due to the loss of blood. (Remind me if something I said was wrong)

When I was little I put my fingers in an elevator door for some reason I don't know why I put my fingers there but then my parents close the door and they opened it really quickly and luckily I don't have any broken bones.

Haminations:I never broke a bone  Me:falls brakes TWO bones,loses half my pinky finger,the same way as the fan story.:[
Not really me injuring myself, but I remember as a kid, I hated drinking water and tried to avoid drinking it as much as possible. I don't remember the details, but I guess I passed out or got the "sleepy juice" because all I remember is being wheeled somewhere and being forced to drink a shit ton of liquids. I have a souvenir from the hospital, a dog dressed in a shirt with the hospital name and logo on it. His name is Joe.

One time, on my 11th birthday, I had a bounce house with a slide, so I decided to climb up the slide instead of taking the normal way. As I climbed the slide I jumped off of it and into the bounce house. I fell face first and my torso bent as my legs stayed the same. I couldn’t breathe for a solid 15 seconds, then I had to just sit down and chill as my friends played with my cousin

People always think that scars on the face look so cool especially ones that cross through an eyebrow but then you ask how they got the scar and it’s something like this
0:33 Bryson: Luckily I've never broken a bone though.  Me: BRUH U JUST BROKE ONE WITH UR ARMS 0-0
Bryson: posts about pain. Me who has broken my bones 5 times:  Finally a worthy opponent,  our battle shall be legendary.
Haminations:cant break an bone Me:falls down of the sofa and my arm goes *BOOM*

I have a similar story to the finger door hinge story thing. One time i was in like kindergarten or something and it was like tricks class or some shit (I was in Finland so classes were way different) and i tried to slide under a table and the table fell onto my fingers super hard and i dont think i even broke a bone. But i was out of school for like a month or two and i couldn't even move my fingers.

Pog my foot is shattered
"You've never broken a bone you're pain is irrelevant!" So is spraining your middle finger 7 times in 2 months irrelevant pain? Or running into a corner of a wall so hard where your skull was almost exposed and sent to the hospital to get stitches on your forehead which some how still hurt 6 years later irrelevant pain?                             Idk why I get so much pain through out my life even being trapped inside did not help at all.
My fingers got stuck in a door as my brother slammed it but part of my fingertip got cut off and they had to sow it back on.
He went  to  jump off  bed.   And. Lost. Lego. Coins. And. Cut in. Half

*Insert Me Relating To This Because I Screamed A The Top Of My Lungs When I Tripped And My Knee Bled Really Bad*
One time I was in the living room playing with the family dog “Spammie” and he disappeared. I looked for him on the couch and he jumpscared me making me fall onto the glass table’s edge headfirst. I didn’t feel anything, then I checked my head and I thought: “Wow, I must be really sweaty my head is so wet.” And I looked on my hand only to see it fully covered in blood and was like “Damn.....” I then proceeded to cry for an hour until my parents came home and brought me to the doctor. I was given two choices, Superglue or Stitch, obviously I chose GLUE. Now I have a bald spot where they glued my head, and in school they were like “Why this dude got a huge bandage on his head”. I was 5/6 so it was intense, it was funny that a blood trail followed my steps, also in the car, my parents were like “Don’t put your head on the seat” either for no blood on the seat or no infection.      If you want another one just reply ig.
Ham intro kind of sucks so you should fix it a little bit
As always my YT crashed when you broke the babby hed.
Personal Story Time:When I was like, 4 or 5, my stepsister, stepbrother and I were on the trampoline, I was jumping and fell, and my leg, was right under my stepsister's in the air foot, and it crashed down on me and broke my right foot, my dad said to walk it off, that's why I always complain about my dad.

3:48 hol up
My enemy gave me a headache once it was the most pain I've ever felt so this is what I did. I grabbed a drill took it to a log drilled a hole in the log put a funnel at the end and a metal tube at the other end and then put sharpened sticks into it and shot them out like a blow dart gun. P.S I also put a plunger in and it broke after I shot it but luckily it stuck to the dudes face.
So you’re telling me you got a scar on your head from slamming into a wall but didn’t get a scar from getting your head onto a fan spinning at max speed
Just like you I have never broken eny bones but I have gotten in a lot of pain before
I got my head stapled 5-7 yrs ago and the scar still there
The punching bag start was me but instead of the wall IT WAS THE CORNER and my aunt and uncle could “see” my brain and I was in the hospital for 2 week I thought I was a ninja so I tried to grab the wall and hold on AND I DDINT BREAK A BONE
Still I have not felt it at all

I like how just Haminations ads meme sounds
I have an extremely  high pain tolerance. It  is hard for me to feel pain and I can shrug off most injuries.  I once took an elbow to the gut from my karate instructor it went underneath the protective padding.   I managed to finish the match before  needing to go home.      Someone said that you could probably  hit me in the back of the skull with a baseball bat and I'd still get a few  solid hits in.
I broke my left arm on may 2nd 2021 and I’m 9 it hurt a lot...
Me latterly at age 3 : knows how momentum works

I had a pretty bad injury a few monthes ago, I casually went to school one day and on a normal walk to science this guy came assaulted me, I now have ligament damage for I dont know how long and was on crutches for about 6 weeks... I still dont know why he did that but I've heard rumours that he did it cause I was annoyed yet I never talked to him or about him so I'm guessing he was either drunk or just stupid

a few weeks ago Two idiots were mucking around in our changing room at school. They banged into me, I banged my head on a metal bolt in the  wall, my friends saw, told me I was losing a lot of blood, and I had to get my head glued.
Well I have had my fingers crushed the same way except they were fractured
There were times where I hit MY funny bone and I felt really funny that I felt that my arm was about to turn numb.
He really said, "My bones hurt."
The random guy is saying right! No one can be never broke the bones!

Hello there! I am here just to say this "Surprising" story that happened earlier today....And btw....   ⚠️ (THIS CAUSED MANY MANY MASS AMOUNTS OF *PAIN* ) ⚠️               So uh         I'll give you the story now!   So basically what it starts off with is, today I was running around outside. Because I was very bored, I then proceeded to run over to the sidewalk, and uhm it was raining earlier and Idiot me was not thinking very straight so I then took a step on the sidewalk I slipped and I then got up,felt my arm and screamed, remind me that my sister and dad were in the house so trying to comprehend what the HELL just happened. Also it happened so quick, I couldn't see what was going on as at first I couldn't feel like anything.. And uhm so now I have a few big scratches on the side of my stomach, a GIANT bump on my head, a scrape on my knee and one on my elbow! I feel the absolute trauma and pain at this point because I have had a headache for FOUR HOURS and it has actually driven me to pure insanity!        (Sorry I capitalized words to much, I was trying to just show some sort of expression or something like that Lol)
This kid makes me laugh sooo much 😂😂😂😂

I broke my toe while running up the stairs......
One time I was skiing down a mountain at like 100 mph then I hit a sharp turn then I fell over and slid sideways and fell over at a third of the speed of sound and my ski flew off and then my poles flew across the thing, and then I rolled like 8 times, annnd almost fell off of it. It hurt, but then I got back up and decided to *ZOOM* back down the mountain at, at least twice the speed. It hurt :/

My friends picked me up under my arms and carried me to the nurse and I went to the hospital and got 5 stiches. Now I have a cool scar on my left eyebrow.

Pain.
I hit my teeth when I was 5 (in kindergarten)on a chair and ripped my gums and it didn’t heal until 2nd grade. Someone had bumped into me while dancing in aftercare and I was hurt. BUT THE OTHER GUY DIDN’T GET HURT AND DIDN’T CARE ONE BIT (he was a jerk anyways). The school never did it again. I got something done in my mouth accosiated with drills when I was 5. It wasn’t fun in the slightest

Hey hamilations, about your eyebrow scar, i have one in the exact same slot
I once broke my head open because me and my sister were young and I was in a tent and my sister had a golf club (know that me and my sister are one and a half years apart), so she hit the tent that I was in with the golf club, but she didn’t know I was there. Note: I remember none of this, I was told this by my sister and mom.

Fall
A few years ago, I was playing with my friends in a park next to the street owned by a school behind it. I wasn’t looking at my friends waiting near the road for their mother to pick them up. When I noticed, I went over to them because I was curious. Then, extremely fast, I got knocked to the nearby inactive fountain. A small wound has on my right thigh, still hurt as hell. Lotsa bruises. Charles, we’ll call him, is near the entrance with quite a bit of bruises. He was the most okay out of all of us. And we’ll call this kid Frank. He was on the side walk, with quite a bit of burns, a few cuts, and some bruises. We all had been hit by a motorcycle (🎶I’m so drunk I can barely see🎶).
I almost broke my spine in December
I have a scar on my eyebrow too

0:40 🤣
in terms of major injuries i have sustained, i think i can say i have experienced quite a bit of pain. like for instance when i was like 5 or 6 i fell down coming out of the bathtub and broke my bone. i recall that it didn't hurt until i tried standing up after thinking i was just fine, little did i know my bone was snapped. oh and the paramedics had to pick me up onto the stretcher and that wasn't fun at all, i also once fell down on a playground and got a concussion and stayed in the hospital for a few hours till i felt normal again. but that time the pain only lasted for a few seconds before i lost my ability to feel pain.
wait u frogot something its le pain

I had Apendicitis and I was in so much pain that I could barely walk because of the pain, then I leaned that Apendicitis is literally that the appendix becomes a bubble and burst and if it burst it causes lots on internal damage because the bubble is made of flesh.

Pain
I’ve only broken an arm...        I was going to a first grade choir performance for Christmas and my mom wanted to get us some shoes. There was these tables that were each taller than each other, so my dumb mind thought that it’d be a GREAT idea to climb it. My mom told be specifically not to but I did anyways. I was not a parkourist, so the table started to fall because it was somewhat night since each table got night and higher. I didn’t want to get in trouble so I put my right arm in the way of the table catch it. Me being weak and the table being like the size of my didn’t really work out. The table pulled me to the ground with it. And I screamed for like 2 minutes straight until my mom finished paying because the store clerks didn’t bother to help a young screaming  child as a 2-3 year old watches (my brother.) then during the performance (which I still did even though I was in extreme pain) I lost my jingle bell. Then we went to the doctor they were like “no it’s not broken.” Then like a few minutes later they come and say “Oh, it’s broken.” So yeah. Me being a 5-6 making better choices that my 2-3 year old brother. Fun times. Glad I’m only partially insane!

This wasn’t me but my brother. Basically when we were kids, we did swimming classes. My brother was wearing flip flops and he tried to open the door by himself. Well, the door got caught on his toenail, ripping his toenail clean off. He was screaming, my mom was screaming, the people inside were probably screaming, but me? No, somehow this didn’t affect me at all. I just stared at his now bare toe, not knowing what to do. We had to go to the ER, but luckily he was fine and it grew back. I’ve been told after that happened, the place put up a sign telling people to keep a good distance from the door when opening or closing it and instructing parents to open the door for little kids.

I did not broke a bone in my life!
This makes me remember how when I was three years old and sitting on a 1.20 meter tall table, my father came back from using his motorcycle and I, as a smart person took his helmet and put it on my own head which made me fall face first, I hit especially my lips. I now have a cool scar that looks like a fat vein under my downer lip
Bruh your videos are so funny😂😂😂
Your parents would like "why does my child always get hurt"
i once had a brain freeze for 30 seconds. all other pain is irrelevant

I've only hurt my funny bone once, electric funny shot.
I split my ear open once and it did not effect me somehow (I was 2-3) my dad didn’t even take me to the hospital immediately because I was unaffected
Bryson, I know that the no bone thing was a joke but, if we did have no bones we would just be a pile of blood and organs
I was on a scooter once and i was on a slant. There was a rock that caused the scooter to flip over and fling me into the concrete and do a scorpion so far that my feet landed on the ground. Thankfully im flexible though so it didnt hurt that bad :3

Once I was playing hockey when I was 9 with the wooden hockey sticks about to get the ball from a friend when he charged up his swing and blasted the ball away, but the hockey stick kept going up and hit me on the eyebrow and I had to go to the hospital. Today I still have the scar on my face. ow edit: another time i was running to the car trying to tag my 15 year old brother(i was still 9 at the time) when I ran onto a person's front garden to jump and get my brother but when I jumped the was a small wall on the edge of the garden, so I face planted into the concrete pavement and had to go to hospital. again, and got another lifetime scar. btw this literally happened 2 days after the hockey thing. :(, it hurt.

Ok so I was sleeping in my room and I have a cat named gizmo. She is a little blind and when she was younger would freak out from a lot of stuff when she was younger. Apparently it was really windy and something had slammed into this window in the kitchen and this freaked gizmo out and she charged towards my room and ran over my face. She almost blinded as she left a scar on my eyebrow and if she was a little lower would have blinded my right eye. Luckily she has never done anything like that again

Oh, you want pain? Lemme tell YOU a story about my pain...  One time, I went on a field trip with my class (it wasn't a FIELD trip, but you get it) to Twin Rinks. As I was getting my skates on, this random person who wasn't from my school at all decided to just stomp on my exposed foot (no skate on it). Fortunately, it wasn't that hard, but UNFORTUNATELY, he had skates on, so it hurt like HECC. So, I had to wait 10 minutes until I finally stood up, and another 10 just to put the skate on. Anyway, when I FINALLY got to the ice, I immediately fell and hit my head on the corner of one of those big ol' doors that open to let in the Zamboni. Luckily, I already had my helmet on (the reason I said that is because the exact same happened to me one time, only I had my helmet off). While I was gaining my balance on the ice, I decided to take a break next to one of those penalty boxes (or whatever). The thick ol' door was open, and I stupidly put my hand to the hinge... The same person who stepped on my already painful foot decided to maim me even more and slammed the thick ol' door on my hand, and it didn't stop until it latched in and locked. I had to wait there with my hand making like a fountain and filling the ice up with blood until he decided to let me live and opened the door (legend has it the piece of flesh is still there to this day). I had to spend the rest of the week using a COMPUTER to do my school assignments. I still have the scar to this day.
Today I am a kid and elesebeth and Aaron saw me on my bike and I almost fell into the sewage my forehead was gushing blood and I got a gush elelebeth went to a store luckily there was a nurse there and I got into LOTS OF PAIN untill the moment that I got home there was still blood but I just ignore the pain and my parents said I would take a bath but instead I ate my McDonald's food first and I'm about to take a bath now and then my parents played a movie (the end of my good story🥰🥰🥰)

At least about 95% of my pain is not of my stupidity you see the pain a go through was inevitable because I knew how doors worked.
I remember one time when life told me who's boss. It was the day after I learned to bike without training wheels . It was a normal day outside not a cloud in the sky and i went a bit speedy on my bike and then before I saw it BOOM my helmet shook a bit I fell on my knee where it hurt the most and when I looked down and i saw THE WORST INJURY TO MY KNEE EVER . My knee was bleeding like I had been shot there I and  screamed like a banshee luckily someone heard and helped me too get a bandage on and everything was okay and my knee looked better after a few weeks and everything was fine except for how careful I was on my bike. It will never be the same

The most painful thing I experienced was one time I was at a ninja place or something were your a monkey and climb around things and I went there for a fort nite camp because my parents didn’t know any other place we like. And we had to do a run around of the whole thing. There was this obstacle I didn’t like and so the older kid like 14 or 15 told me to go. So I went. And the best descision for him was. *a slight push that menacingly meat my demise* and what means is I feel down 5 feet and went head first into a plank of wood :)
Greetings! From, Law-Opacity Ham  Anyone find that?

I agree with Bryson. I haven’t ever broken a bone but multiple of times have I CRACKED MY HEAD OPEN.
Well, I faceplanted into some bricks, the grey ones with 2 cubic holes, 3 feet high. I was walking on them, and tripped into one of the holes. We have a camera facing near that area, but I fell even before I had reached camera view. I fell on the bricks, red mark from my chest to my thigh, (from the edge of the brick wall), pierced my skin in many areas, scraped up my arm where the other side of my elbow is, (still have a scar, but it was only like a month ago), broke part of my nail off, sprained my big toe on my right foot,  and so on. No broken bones, tho. Lesson learned. DON'T CLIMB ON BRICK WALLS. Or any wall for that matter.  Congrats if you see this comment, and stay safe! Oh and by the way, I saw this video on my sister's nintendo switch, and it wasn't signed in. My phone, (which I'm on now), was on the top bunk. I've never had the guts to do this before, but I was so lazy to move to the other side of the bed, I just put my foot on the bar holding it up, grabbed the side, and pulled my self up to grab my phone. Then jumped down. Easyy
You're lucky you didn't have your forhead broken open by slipping off a big Rock face first on concrete my poor sister   Past me YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
I have a scar on my eyebrow too
You have fortnite
Something you dont know:i a similar thing with my friends as the basketball thing😂😂😂😂😂😉😂

Your body when your young might be bendy but I broke a leg at 4 and all I remember is the pain and I have dreams about it I got a atv for my 4th birthday and after 10 minutes I went to get off and we'll my leg got stuck in the wheel well so yea I don't think it's that bad all if that has happened I also got a nail in my finger once and had to get it
I'm 10 and have broken 3 Bone's
my name is bryson ;-)
Im not a heartless person, im just laughing because of the screams.
That's gonna hurt a lot
OMG THAT MADE ME CRINGE SUPER DUPER ULTRA HARD 1:16
I had a scar across my eye once because I went to a place where they had a little plastic and pretty strong castle, so I was at the bottom and I heard "Look out!" from above me, I look up to see what it was, AND THE CASTLE HAD FALLEN APART and I was hit in the face  and with a scar across my eye and was buried in the ruble for like 20 min  I remember the time I got hurt the most, I was about seven years old, my school had these two metal poles on the playground, right next to each other, so I was sitting on one of them, I lost my balance and bashed the left side of my head on to the other metal pole, and then I did this back first backflip and ended up hitting my head again on the mulch,  everything hurt and everything was blurry so they had to get a wheelchair to bring me to the nurses office, ended up getting a Concussion, The nurse just ended up calling my dad to bring me home and giving me an ice pack, never knew about the concussion until like three days later, if that doesn’t tell you that school nurses are incompetent I don’t know what will. Mark is still there, still a bump behind my ear, even if I touch it’ll flareup again just like the day I got it   Another time I was about 10 and my mom, me and my little brother were moving into a new place, a got my bike and decided to go with them to "The ramp", it was a strong wood plank on top of like 4 bricks to keep it up, I was fine the first time, but the second time I went down at full speed, and went up the ramp and LET GO OF THE BIKE, did a full front flip, smashing my back on the floor, in my head I said "Where's the bike?" and BAM, the bike fell from 3 and a half meters up ONTO MY LEGS, leaned on a rock for about an hour, came back and sat in my bed for like 2 days, it was summer break, pain  I'll add more if I keep suffering
What app do u use for animating pls tell me

Don’t worry I have never broken a bone either
Pain is everything
I’ve never broken a bone before, either. I have jammed my finger though. And have you ever had to get a splinter taken out from the bottom of your foot? Probably the worst pain I’ve ever been in.
4:22 why did you try to sound like a little kid you already are 😁😁😁
If all that hurts you should see what its like to have a verooka  removed (idk how to spell that word if i spelled it wrong)
I feel that 😔

I liked the Yoda scream
One time I was doing monkey bars and for some reason there was a ladder halfway through. I didn’t see it, so I smash right underneath my knee onto the metal ladder. It was like stubbing a toe. The pain didn’t come right away, so I told my friend “oh I guess I have chosen death well ima go die in peace”. A few seconds later. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Young Bryson hurt his self so hard from the mountain.
His back scorpion so hard that causes a lot of ouchy pain.
Young Bryson is like: AHHHH AHHHH
Don’t do it!!!!!!! Fans are dangerous!
I have a similar experience with just not feeling the pain at first. So I was four years old and little me decided at 7:30 at night I was going to go up the down slide. But there’s a catch. THERES ALWAYS A CATCH.   This was a water slide so I slipped, and I assume it just hurt so bad and I was so numb I couldn’t feel it but the water was red so I be like mwa mwa is I bloody?  My mom just looks at me in shock puts a towel over it so I didn’t lose to much blood and rushed me to the hospital like she was in some knock off version of sonic. I got 4 stitches in my chin and that was honestly the worst part and I remember trying to hide it at school because I was convinced it looked like a beard 🧔 -_-
The begging: I'm a ragdoll!!
0:40 WTF-
Mom 😥 😓 😅

Nice drake meme.
4:41 Bryson: hits the random guy me: eating while watching this  Me again: *FALLS OF CHAIR*
Sequel to I almost die video everybody no someone no.
Here are some of my injuries that no one asked for:  Broke my arm while doing a backflip on a trampoline, because when the floor of the trampoline was bouncing back up, it hit my arm with such force that it broke it.  Smashed my head into a metal pole, which my mom subsequently named “Poledemort” because it gave me a scar on my forehead. I get to get stitches afterwards.  Fell all the way back in a chair. I can’t name an exact instance in which this happened, but it must have happened multiple times in multiple places, mostly in school.  Bruising my leg by bumping it into multiple things many times.
Man you were a great trouble-maker and pretty known patient to the hospital.
Yo he kinda sounds like finn from adventure time
Ive broken my right arms 4 times technically :)  1st time (/+2nd time) My family has a pair of rollerblades that i used all the time. I wanted to go out to our driveway to use them so i had to go through the garage. Our garage has a thing where once you enter the garage, there’s a little step because our house is slightly elevated. I was walking with rollerblades on to the driveway, and forgot to step down at the little stair. I tripped and hit my right arm goooood on a carseat nearby, and immediately *screamed so loud i think all my nextdoor neighbors heard* aaand woohoo both bones were brokennn  2nd time / 3rd time  I was at my granmother’s house and she has a big plastic tic tac toe board. Me and my brothers were playing an obstacle course and i missed the beanbag and slammed my arm on the tic tac toe board, and screamed, immediately alerting my sister on the other side of the house- yeah i broke both bones again it was very painful- my arm looked like a rollercoaster, my mom said.
OW
One time my finger got caught on the back of my 🚗car when I was a kid it was little painful not that painful but owwwwy

Connection terminated.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth. If you still even remember that name.  But I'm afraid you've been misinformed.  You are not here to receive a gift. Nor, have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although, you have indeed been called.  You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune.  A labyrinth with no exit. A maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust of blood has driven you in endless circles. Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near.  It's somehow out of reach.  But, you will never find them. None of you will.  This is where your story ends.  And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although, there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be.  I am remaining as well. I am nearby.  This place will not be remembered and the memory of everything that started this, can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.  And to you monsters trapped in the corridors. Be still. And give up your spirits.  They don't belong to you.  As for most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps, warm, waiting for you after the smoke clears.  Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole. So, don't keep the Devil waiting, friend.  My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up in their arms, the way you lifted others into yours.  And then, what became of you, I should have known, you wouldn't be content to disappear. Not my daughter. I couldn't save you then.  So, let me save you now. It's time to rest, for you, and for those you have carried in your arms...  This ends.  For all of us.  End communication.

Ham
I also have a scar on my eyebrow I got it when I ran face first I to a table
I have also suffered from severe pain and I will now say the time I had pain. So I was in school, in class P1 (Primary 1, because I live in Scotland. (Or not, I don't know what it is in american.)) and I was swinging on my     chair... BUT there was a wooden table behind me and then I swung to hard and my chair began to fall backward and I went with it banging the back of my head onto  the table getting rid of a lot, and you might've been able to see my skull but I don't know because I couldn't see it but I was in pain and how it got fixed was some sort of glue stuff, I didn't know what it really was or what it did and I think I was 5 or 6 at the time tho. And that was the time I had a lot of pain, it also bled a LOT.
my fav animation by you

"and today im gonna talk about the times my entire nervous system wen't ÆEEEEE"
My ankles and feet are cat feet and cat ankles. That’s why I kinda just jumped off a swing when it was swinging and why I jumped off from a kinda high angle.
Breaking a bone isn’t even that painful honestly  Edit: I’ve gone against my own case
Me as a kid: *Sees bubbles* *Reaches for them* *Falls off monkey bar* *Breaks arm* *Gets arm twisted by principal* *Dies*
i also have a cool scar across my eye brow story : i was a toddler my parents were at a rated MA wedding so me and my brother couldn't go, i was at the stairs and somehow i cut my eyebrow, i was to young to get the sleeping juice so they made my uncle hold me and do the stitched stuff. if u r wondering where i was at the time my parents were at the wedding i was at my aunt and uncles house.
Random dude: your not 19    Branson: IMMA BEAT THE LIVING S**T OUT OF YOU
I'm losing blood at an alarming rate, and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian, would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurely due to the lose of blood

I watched you like three years ago
Four fingers
3:23 That happened to me once, but It was with one of those heavy metal doors that if you don't hold, it closes
Fan: go away. Him: no. Fan: alright you asked for it. :him AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
And I thought I was in pain (0_0)
So you cut your finger tip off you stepped in glass and you bust your head open like 60 times
So you jumped off your bunk bed when the fan is spinning at fast speed I just like climb down there because the fan is that the different angle
I remember that wen I was 3 my dad closed the Door and I giot my finger stuck on the door  but I didn't scream
For some reason all that went through my mind while watching this was... Pain with out love, pain can’t get enough Pain, I like it rough cause I’d rather pain than nothing at all
Hey umm i got mcdonald and 5 mins later an mcdonalds ad came on before the video
Ah yes, Bryson our ruthless dictator...

I still remember the day I broke my arm :’c it was on the first day of winter break and I fell of my scooter and landed on some rocks and when I opened my eyes I saw the handle for which your hands are supposed to be right in front of my face I’m grateful that it didn’t land in my head because being the stupid idiot child I was I didn’t wear any helmets or protective padding and the doctor called me out for it 😞 but anyway I got up and threw the scooter since I couldn’t carry it I guess but anyway and the thing was I was being babysat because I was a wee child in the 3rd grade and not that long ago my cousin who lived next to the babysitter had left. And when I cried for help people ignored me :c and I cried and such my family took me to the hospital I got red cast the end. :l

ya know, When you hit your funny bone, it isn't your bone that is going through the pain, but a vein that gets put on pressure when you bend it.
0:07  Roblox breaking bones be like:
Have you stubbed you toe in the middle of the night but you couldn't scream because everyone was asleep.pure pain
Pain cannot hurt you. And I vote for a funny bones removed.

He’s right about that helmet hung for babies you know, I had to wear one after my head dented in because of my weak skull but I’m alright now but one of my ears is lower than the other 🤣🤣

Oh my God I love the pain video I have watched it 10 times every day and it’s my favorite video out of all of them
So that ahhhhhhhhhhh did you summon a demon
A few years ago I had a pair of dirty socks that i wanted to put away in the hamper. Let me tell you, I just got out of the shower, so the floor was wet. I go in the bathroom, slip on the wt floor, then I hit my head on the sink. I look the mirror, and guess what I saw. Blood. I had busted my ear open, and I started screaming. My mom came running and saw the damage. My stepdad in the other room thought I was getting spanked, so he did nothing. My mom calls my stepdad screaming, then he starts running over. He sees what happened, then got a paper towel. We ran to the car, and we rushed to the ER, then we had to get my ear super glued. Now I have a cool scar on my ear!

If you remove bones what about your guts
Almost lost all my blood from hitting my head on like one of those corner things when I was one or two
Bryson: when ur really young ur bones are soft and moldable that’s why my bones didn’t break...— also that’s why some babies need to where helmets otherwise you might accidentally sculpt there soft head into a cone like this.  -sculpts soft head into a cone like that-  Me: tries to sculpt a babies soft head into a cone.  -doesn’t sculpt into a cone-  Me: awww, man this was a rip-off.
Who else loves the way he beats up people??

Me: I'm lucky (and careful enough) to have never broken a bone. Also me: breaks my bottom lip open, hits head to the point where I'm almost incapable of having dreams, smashes eye into a door handle multiple times, and all of this happened at the ages of 1-2 years old.   Seriously it's a wonder I'm in highschool
i broke my wrist :D
Most of my pain is mental or emotional pain. The only time I felt both was almost everyday after school when I was bullied and beat up by my older sister and/or my dad.

Ok so storytime: It was Sunday and the preacher cancelled church since it was snowing a LOT outside. So me have nothing else to do I get out the wii and am playing wii sports resort. One of the games I played is called quick slice (I think) and in this game you are given random objects to slice in a certain way. My sister is just chilling on her electronics when she decides to get up to go to the kitchen, she got up thinking it was paused because the background sound and music quite quieter, little did she know that the game sounds went down  to create s u s p e n c e, so she gets up, and coincidentally the game tell me to swing in the exact direction she was standing. Im trying to be fast because the game is times, so i swing with ALL of my 12 year old strength and force not knowing my sister was literally a few feet away. As I SMACK her with a wii remote she falls on the ground, and SOMEHOW doesn't faint. Now she has a big scar on her eyebrow from where I smacked her with a wii remote

How did you not die in the beginning-  My pain 1: When I was playing with a weight, and my mom said. "Don't play with that weight! You could drop it!" I didn't listen bc I was 2 years old. The weight was 20P. I kept playing with it, and it dropped on my foot. But I'm good, bc I was 2- but screaming  My pain 2: I was playing on this tablet. (THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY) I was moving it rapidly, and you probably know what happened, it fell on my face. Onto my nose. IT WAS FRIGGIN BLEEDING! I told my mom, she said it was fiiiiinnnnnneeeeee, and healed in an hour-  My pain 3: (happened 2 weeks ago) I was going to the store with my sister and my mom, I looked both ways, and they both weren't looking. I thought they were coming with me. Of course, a car came.. It nearly touched me, but it ran over my foot. They were going like.. 100 MILES PER HOUR!!! The limit was 40, AND THEY DISOBEYED!! MY FOOT STILL FRIGGIN HURTS, but luckily it's not cracked or broken.. TT   Those experiences were just awful

You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep 'Cause they fill the open air And leave teardrops everywhere You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems 'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs From ten thousand lightning bugs As they tried to teach me how to dance A foxtrot above my head A sock hop beneath my bed A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread) I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep) Leave my door open just a crack Please take me away from here 'Cause I feel like such an insomniac Please take me away from here Why do I tire of counting sheep? Please take me away from here When I'm far too tired to fall asleep To ten million fireflies I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell) But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar, jar) I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep) I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep

Do you hate Furrys because I am furry
0:12 everytime I fight a person that’s a level higher then me
ow screams a lot
I am a tired
related to the story of when you got your fingers slammed in your brothers door: a similar thing happened to me except it was my mom who slammed my fingers and not a sibling. i was really young and really really small, so i was standing by my mom just outside the laundry room but she couldn't see me. i put my fingers between the door and the wall, and mom finished what she was doing so she left the room and tried to close the door. she couldn't close the door because my fingers were in the way of course so she got confused and slammed harder. now i was doing the thing kids do where their mouths are open and they are trying to scream and cry but they can't because they are in too much pain to get air out, so she didn't hear OR see me. she tried slamming the door maybe one more time before looking down and seeing that her stupid child was just sitting there with their fingers still in the door  and if you're wondering, the reason i didn't move my fingers was because i was in too much pain to think reasonably, plus i was a dumb toddler. i was more focused on getting noise out. my fingers are fine now of course, though i would like to think the reason one of my fingers is double jointed is because of that finger slamming thing :]
Ima tired
I can't wait for bryson to be in lego star wars the skywalker saga
Well.....  I have like 22 bruises

Hi
Beautiful title yes yes
I once tripped on a sea urchin in the ocean while I was standing of a rock when I went to Mexico and for some reason I felt like it was ww2 or something. Most of the pricks were taken out of my foot but some stayed there until we got back from the vacation. I had to limp around for the rest of the trip.
🩹🩹🩹🩹🩹🩸🩸🩸🩸
Hahaha
Bryson:not uploading Me:Bryson died me:crying for 50 hours Bryson:school me :so your the person who is behind it
Me having nightmares: ahhhhhhhhhhh  life:I want you to die buddy Bryson:I feel the same pain
A similar things happened to me with the door hinges. My thumb was in the hinges and a didn’t notice so I closed it on my thumb. The hinge was ridged as well so it cuts into my thumb, leaving a piece of skin hanging off. Something similar happened when I dropped a huge bottle of soap, but instead of leaving hanging skin, it cut so deep that you could barely see the nail. I had a bruise under my nail and it took about 5 months to heal. Pain sucks.
4:46 well we can fix that Bryson : kills him
So basically the times I almost died part 2
I relate to you after i just hit my toe with a metal can-

Fun fact funny bones aren't actually bones it's actually a nerve that is between two of your bones also connecting to your arm bones and if it gets hit and makes a wide range of physical pain because you're hitting a nerve

One day I was at my aunt's house and we had this tube and I was spinning around it and I ended up hitting my chin on a METAL BENCH and that's not all, one day I went with the SAME AUNT to a park with my cousin and his friend, they were having a soccer match so I stayed outside on a bench with my aunt, then I see this kid jump over one of those CAUTION! string fences and I went: "Hey aunt, lookie here" and then I fell onto my forehead on a concrete path, the funny thing is, I didn't cry until my aunt washed my forehead and I saw the blood and I was like: "BLOOD? WAAAAAAA!", wow I would be a good animator
When I was little I actually tried what Bryson did with not using the ladder and I ended up landing sideways and fracturing my hip.

Make more funny animation videos please 🙏🙏🙏  Edit:  tf bruh this comment is like 2 years
No pain I actually didn't feel pain and twisted the foot more like a big toe and it had to be well when I was trying to walk it would try to break my soul hurt so much man so much trauma that's trying to walk around and this happened like from I have a family but my mom took my me from my father because he got drunk a lot so and I went over because now he has a little custody of me custody that means he has no more and so I can visit him if I want to but out of that way once when I was at his house he actually rented a little bouncy house was with water and you know bouncy houses when you like slide down a little bouncy he didn't do a corner you might like get nervous he might have to twist it you might twist it by accident and that's what happened with water and about the house God it hurts I had to go home real fast it literally was like hell for me the entire day and then next day yep I still stayed till I was hoping it would twist itself back it belonged but now was too so I went home to my mom he knows what to do because she was practicing to be in a nurse before I was born and my sister was born before me out of that I just twisted my foot on the thing by going too fast and I was too big 10 years old and my feet went into the wall and twisted itself on it like whoosh because the water was making this friction so I went into stick to the thing and twist and it hurt it like hell I had to stay in the water for so long and cuz it wasn't going to hurt me the water just left the pain alone and me and just so long from the pain so much so much tragedy so much drama this is why you never trust bouncy houses you have a slide or water bouncy houses you can go f*** yourself water bounty houses maybe bouncy houses too maybe because they haven't gave me anything like that bad only once I got that beaten up a little bit and about to go fight between a bigger kids but my brother and me still want to fight and they're scared but now I'm 10 years old so maybe I can beat them up on my I'm not a bully I just like cuz they were talking about my size and gets me pissed man and also I have a disorder of I get mad easily so if you just flip me off or just tell me something I don't like I'll punch you to hell I will punch people it hurt it much as I got tossed into the bouncy houses while we're we were fighting them I just kept on going back and back back and back and then I kept on hitting them in the legs hurt that much when my cat actually scratches me it doesn't remind me of all that beating up hurts thinking about it yep they are they hit my jaw once yep we were sweating and that's I guess that's why so slippery and also there was a crack who was wearing some people put bubble in the soap to make bubbles I don't know why but I guess that
MEDIIIIIICCC!!!!!

And breaked my bridge bone (i dont remember its english name) Number 2: i was 7 and at school going to show my origami thing to my friend but someone putted his bag on my way and i felled, my head bumbed to corner of a table. When i open my eyes i saw *BLOOD* and i scream Number 1: i was 3 years old at Antalya (again) i was sliding at mud with my belly i bumped my head to a tree branch and my eyes are covered with mud. I accidentally changed my direction to the dirty river. The river ended but i am still sliding at mud then i my headbumped to my scooter i tryed to wake up but i bumped my head to the wood fence. I tryed to run away but i lied down by mud. I guess i eat a worm (i was a weird kid)

It turns out i has a cict. “A gaint thing that is in your body to long turns solid” it banged up against my hip and i heard a crack. I felt burns around it and i couldent move or i would get completely shocked on my hole left leg. I though a snapped somthing or twisted my leg but no. I broke my hip.

Hey! Guess what? I made up a version of Ham. I called it Criggit. Here is the tutorial:  1. Make a circle 2. Draw a piece of another circle from the middle of one side to the bottom, and do it again but from the other side. 3. Between those lines, make that cute cartoon cat smile. 4. Make the nose between the cheeks. 5. Make 2 circle eyes darkened in I really hope that helped! Bye!!😄 Edit: 3.5. Make the cheeks a little above both of the lines.

This is like the oodoneout
I actually relate to the door one, because one day when I was really young my hands were under the window in my bathroom, (Don't judge the window on my bathroom) but then for some reason the window shut, and this thing is really big and thick sooo...

Ok not to trash talk but the funny bone isn’t a funny bone it’s just nerves that are near the bones and when high pressure is ya know applied it hurts really bad so you don’t want to get rid of your bones you should get rid of your nerves.

Me: Ive never broken a bone Somebody: your pain is irrelevant Me: once in 1st grade I saw kids going down the slide and then stopping half way and jumping down. I wanted to do the same so I did but instead of landing on my feet I landed on my face. It hurt a lot. Yeah my pain is irrelevant

Missed the opprotunity to add “GAME”
Once when I was 4, I was dropping my sister off at school with my mom. And my school has a park. I went down the slide and turned my head around. As I do that, I get kicked in the face from some kid. I was also wearing glasses at the time and the kick hit a corner beside a lens. The glasses snapped and dug into my face. Had to have stitches right there and I am the reason that my school only allowed one person down the slides at once.
I fell off a tree today

Me when i was 4 : slips and heads bleed*
Me : gets hurt 30 Times
Come to my house I have a dog
The new among us kill effect 4:44
Y'know considering that pain only exists to alert the body of pain, and the fact that we have technology to examine and confirm any injury without feeling bad hurty, couldn't we simply reengineer our nervous system to not feel pain as modern technology makes the feeling of pain virtually pointless?
School and Legos: am I a joke to you?
Video name: "Pain"   2.4M:interesting...

every time you explained what happened before the injury, like, I was going to jump off my bed but there was a fan there, or, I was going to tackle a swinging punching bag, I was like, *tchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh* ooh no, this video was good though.
Why does ham move every time you go to your room 🤨
Mario gets hospital every single time he doesn’t look like Mario anyways
Some people find this weird but I find somebody in pain or really struggling funny hearing about the times he gets hurt it’s just making me laugh
ham:oooh that door henge looks pretty cool I should put my fingers in there bob or what ever his name is: slams door* ham:AHHHHHHHHHHHH

I fell off a crapy porch swing cause it swung backwards.... long story short I had to go to the hospital.... I am surprised that I didn’t break anything
When I was younger, I was hanging on a bed in my house when I fell off and felt like I had a headache

Listen if we had no bones we would would be very very floppy and we would basically die so no we need to have bones this is that is why humans exist in things online and do exist and things that you have bones exist to live their lives swim including wings of Audubon still need to wait to walk the octopusSo no that’s just dumb

A time my whole nervous system went AAAAAAAAAA was three days ago. I was lying on my bed watching a Thomas the Tank Engine YTP. (Yes, I still watch YTPs.) I slipped off of my bed to homeschool that day, and I should've got off the bed like a normal person because this happened; I slammed my hip onto the *metal* bed frame and it felt like an electrical fire on my hip. I screamed along with my nervous system. That was probably the loudest scream I ever screamed in my life. Now I have a giant bruise on my hip.
I'm going to. Shcool

When you finally get an editing program:
You would not vote for the removal of the funny bone but the removal of a vein in your arm that gets pinched when you bend your elbow so when you hit is it hurts a lot.

Oh I did that scorpion thing but I was going on one of those gliders at school, and I was going too fast so my little stupid brain told my hands to let go. So I did, causing me to literally fly, hit a kid named Sierra’s shoulder, and fell on the ground, causing me to do the scorpion and get a crack in my skull and having to spend Easter in the Intensive Care Unit...
Hey Bryson tell us about your new girlfriend we wanna know because the last video us my first kiss  😘 but we want part two
When i was in grade 3, the day had just ended, and Me and my cousin were waiting for my sister to get out, then we got bored and she started to hit me with her silver water bottle, I was defending myself with my arms, then, she hit my funny bone, and it had such a shock, and it almost felt like she knocked that bone out of its place
I want to pet the ham😍😍😍😍😍😍
This reminds me of the time I broke every one of my bones and healed all of them after a month     Somehow
This kid is probably 14 or something
Man when you fell of the cliff and almost died u should have said ow I scrapped my arm
You want you ex girlfriend back?   TO BAD SHE ISN'T COMING BACK BUDDY...
Cool once I split my head open and this other time I broke a finger
You need a P.O. Box
Wow, I guess I'm not the only one who jumped off my bunk bed and hit my head on a spinning fan.
You should sub to mr beast 12 13 12
Does your door or sidewalk ever decide to hate sometimes (I have never broken a bone either)
I also have a scar across my eyebrow

I got hurt a lot too Bryson
I’ve had the logic that if I haven’t broken a bone then I haven’t felt real pain and what I say to that is roll 30 feet down a hill and have your bike hit you 4 times in your way down, roll on the handle bars at the end of the fall, hurts a lot without broken bones, if you’re lucky.
Give me the names scream audios 😂
Haha brysons nervous system go AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWAAAAAAAWAAAAAAAAAAAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

“STOP TOUCHING ME! STOP TOUCHING ME! DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?! STOP TOUCHING ME!”
When i was still starting out kindergarten before entering the school building i tripped which somehow made a hole on my knee so deep that i was able to see my bone and at first it wasnt bleeding and feeling painful and a few minutes pass and then the blood and pain kick in, i was crying tears of agony, asking god what i did to deserve this and awaiting my premature demise but thankfully high quality band-aids absorbed all of the no no feelings                                                                                       Never gonna give you up

The start of the video 😰ouch
List of worst pains *i* have felt  1. sinus headache, i know nowhere near a migraine or cluster headache but i was in class and suddenly my mind just went blank and a few seconds later my eyebrows started hurting and after my nose and then near my cheeks, i have had a handful of these headaches since but i just tune it out know 2.Tension headaches, I just get short tension headaches when im zoning out of focusing too much i ignore them now too 3. Electric shock, i was an idiot and i put my finger in a lamp that was on but had no light bulb in. 4. Wasp sting on the palm of my hand, i was four ok leave me alone it hurt  5. *THE BIG ONE* so i was at my school gym and i was on a machine that had big bulky like idk Pedals, (ok i looked it up and just search this "walking glider exercise machine" and imagine it being twice the size of the average 10 year old) and i was walking fast on it and my foot, SLIPPED and it got crushed between the pedals and was just mangled between the pedals i of course went 3:28 and my PE teacher said i kid you not "You alright?" SO I JUST LET OUT THE MOST BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM MY FRIENDS ARE RUNNING OVER TO ME AND ASKING ME WHATS WRONG and he comes out 15 seconds later with a pot of jelly A POT OF FRICKING JELLY,  i was taken out of school and got permission to leave class early for a while.  *bonus* i stubbed my toe on my cousin's plastic slide like a year ago, and broke it  i had a school trip the next day to walk around a giant city with a broken toe ON CRUTCHES, i just remember walking up the steps to a train station going slow for my own safety and a teacher had to run out from the platform to help me up so i did not miss the train, and thats it my own little story

when i was like 6 i loved walking on tables and just walked around feeling like the queen of the world, i jumped on top of a chair and crawled onto the table it was like climbing a mountain. It was great :> . One day when i was trying to get on a table standing on top of a wobbly chair made my mom scared so she told me to get down, she scared me so i ended up slipping and hitting my forehead with the tip of the table. I didnt go to the hospital because i had just went there (my bigger cousin fell on my right arm and had to get injected) I ended up getting yelled at. But now i have a scar that proves that im cool B)
5:07 lmaoooo
I once stepped on glass :(
I’ve been in lots of pain (and still kinda am) and never broke a bone  EDIT: Bsck a few months ago, I slipped and landed on my left wrist. My arm still hurts

For anyone who hates nerds, please keep scrolling. Thank you.     THE PVC PIPE INCIDENT. We all know that the funny bone is annoying. But in truth, the funny bone is not actually the bone. It’s a tiny nerve that is slightly exposed right between skin, and the elbow. If anything touches it, you will feel a slight tingling feeling in your hand, since it’s connected to your ring, and pinky fingers.  THE SNOW BOARD INCIDENT That’s actually a good thing, but also a bad thing. Is acutely one of the ways men can get more flexible like women. Only, your not supposed to bend your back that much on the first try. (Know offense)

What is it like without breaking a bone Bryson!? I broke my collar bone falling off a chair.
My sister crushed my big toe under a door and than I pushed the door open and the door took my nail and some skin with it and a broken toe
I felt all of what you were saying man, it's hard once you realize how fragile the human body realy is. 3 years ago on a new years eve I fell on a mop bucket.......and well the rest became history. I was bleeding alot all over my leg, I had an Aunt who is a nurse and she helped take care of it. My whole family knew I needed stitches but I refused to go to the hospital. The next day on The First of January we all agreed me included to get some stitches since the doctor said that "I had fat showing through all the blood  in the hole". That was the first time I had stitches and there were 9 total.....My family always jokes around now saying that I ENDED THE YEAR WITH A BIG BANG.
Pain
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa we get those times

I got hit in the face with a big pvc pipe
One time I hit my funny bone and made me feel like i cracked my bones,  it made me screamed so much
Once I was running at my school black top I fell down I look at my arm and there was to much blood for 4 year old me
How do you know what a Electric shock feels like

i remember when Brysons' animations were a bit rough and flashy , but now they are thin , shaded , and smooth e.g. (rough:octopus attack num 1) e.g.(smooth new:this video) Edit: you wouldn't feel my pain , its called getting shot in the funny bone with a nerf gun that's strongly pressurised
Brson be like I havent broke a bone but I felled a wide range of fisucal Pain :)))) you why is your bone alive
| O _ O |
How the fuck do you survive getting your spine and neck broken
There was a time in 1st grade that I was on the playground and I fell on a ladder groin first and when we were called back... I couldn’t move for like 1 minute and no one noticed, the pain was inevitably painful and I couldn’t tell you how much.
PAIN
Funny
Ow        ´
Funny
Me and you are the same I feel pain I fell down the stairs /keep bruising my knee/ almost broke my neck cracked /my stumped my toe/ punched metal/ got kicked in the nuts/got smashed in the face/ with a tennis racket/ banged my head octillion times/ fell of a bunk bed landed on knee/kicked in the leg/burnt my hands/swallowed a giant grape and choking on it/ getting sprayed in the face with orange juice when I ripped one in half/ punched in the stomach.

0:06 - 0:21 He he he Heya kid  Its me *SANS THE SKELETON*
I never broke a bone my brother did
I don’t like how hard Bryson is trying to fit in with the community. He keeps on trying to put memes and “funny” yelling and jokes that have been worn out from different videos. Just because you fill a video full of memes and screams, doesn’t mean it’s going to go on trending. Too much memes and jokes is going to make it annoying. If you make videos like that, people are going to not like your videos. I’d rather you stick to what your videos were like from June 2nd 2018, to May 10th 2019. Just my opinion.
I subscribed and like
hey...... OCTOPUS ATTACK
🅟🅐🅘🅝 🅘🅢 🅔🅣🅔🅡🅝🅐🅛
Bryson you are so funny 😂 and happy th to you happy 😃 and I love your video so yeah
Hey Bryson my idea for your next video is all about among us

*I am losing blood at a alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me the hospital to help heal the wounds so that I can continue this moral journey rather than ending it pretty prematurely due to loss of blood.*
Holy crap!

BRYSON I JUST REALISED, WHEN U MOVE OUT OF UR PARRENTS HOUSE... well remember the girl who kissed you... if you wanted to, YOU COULD MOVE TO WHERE SHE LIVES.

When i was 3, i tripped a fell down two steps. Now i have scars on my eyebrows and never got stitches bc my aunt (who was 16) couldn't drive at the time and forgot 911 was a thing.  So she put barny bandaids on the wounds, gave me ice cream, and sat me down in front of the tv.

In 1st grade I was playing tag with one of friends 5th grade friends. I was ruinning because I was the tagger. But then when one of my classmates were running they bumped into me. I tripped to the floor hardly and I felt it. *The fricking pain* I cried as hell. Then one of my classmate rushed to my teacher. my teacher and the other teacher rushed to me. We were playing on a hard,  rocked floor. Making a big ow feeling. I went to the nurse bearly walking with a classmate helping me. I had to sit on a chair for reading and math for 3 days.
What’s the screaming sound effect when Bryson got his hand smashed by the door
When I was little, I threw a speaker in the air, watched it come down, and it landed on my right eyebrow. My grandmother had to stitch it because I was brought to the hospital so many times. Now I'm missing hair there.

Why do you sound lile a 13 year old when you are much older...
4:30 - No, you're not a tire.
I have had many physical pain moments.  Like this one time, i was on the playground, I couldn’t climb the monkey bars (because I was 6 at the time), I jumped and grabbed the monkey bars, little did I know, i had lots of momentum and I slingshotted and landed in the sandpit onto my arm, and I broke it. Why? Because there was concrete underneath the sandpit, and also because my full body landed on my arm. I had a cast for a month.  Another time, I was at OfficeWorks, and had a pretty heavy box full of school supplies, I was on the curb and I slipped, the box landed onto the road and i twisted my ankle. I couldn’t walk properly for a week.  When I was very young, I was on my trampoline while my family was inside our house, I jumped off the trampoline, fell on my leg and almost snapped it. I got taken to the hospital. And then I remember having chocolate pudding in my house afterwards. It was some tasty pudding. 🤕
I like how when he beats someone up it ends with a explosion
Bryson I really love your videos and I’m new to the channel

Message for everyone who is like: WoW BrYsOn Is LyInG. HeS nOt 19🙃! Stop calling Bryson a kid. I think he does not deserve to be just talked about like that. How would yall feel if u were called names based on the thing people bullied u about. Thats how he feels. I feel sorry for Bryson.

I can’t stop laughing at the screams
Ok but heres an unrelated story ok so lemme set the scene I'm like 5, 6, or 4 and my brother had the matress of the bed so I think "hmmm I'm bored so I should belly flop on the matress" yet my bed frame was like a foot away from my head each flop and speaking of bed frame IT WAS MADE OF WOOD and guess what, I flopped onto the frame head first and thats the story of my possible only stiches.
My favorite part was where he screamed. Also you do good content.
I had enough stabing my toes
Just wondering Bryson. What video games do you like to play?
You can’t say screaming
Man who is this guy he’s awesome!!
I've hit my head so many times that it suprises me and my family that I'm still alive and with out brain damage
Finish the lyrics, and say the song. ( its an old-ey)  There's a port on a western bay And it serves a hundred ships a day Lonely sailors pass the time away And talk about their homes
When I hit my funny bone it feels like  my left side up to my pinkie feels like it's paralyzed

Pain
Here’s a funny story of me getting pain.  So I was at a sleepover with all of my friends, like 5, so there was this treadmill in one of the rooms, and being the 8-9 year olds we were, we started to run on the treadmill, and when I got on it, I put it on it’s highest speed, but when it got there, my legs turned into sonic cause my legs just went going, so I need to turn it off or slow it down, so I told my friends to press one of the stalling numbers for the speed, and for some reason they didn’t know what I meant, I guess they didn’t see how fast it was going, so to try to stop my tired legs I started to use the hand bars to pull my self off the treadmill, but there was something, if I let go, I would fall on it, and see since my friends were idiots at the time, I chose to be like them and let go of the hand bars to reach the buttons to slow it down, then I fell on the treadmill, scraping it with legs, arms, and head, then slammed into the wall to add an Insult to injury, and let me tell you that the wall was like 1 foot away from the treadmill, so ofc I screamed, and my parents and the parents that lived there came in, so let me tell you that my parents haven’t left the house when this happened, and after this happened, my parents stay a lot longer then they were going too, so when I got hit I was bleeding, like 8 different places had a cut, and somehow no broken bones, I wonder how, but I say I’m lucky, so the rest of the time at the sleepover, I was in so much pain, couldn’t do anything fun with them.  So that was my stupid story I’d like to call “the treadmill incident” and you could say I was in a lot of pain, you’d be wrong cause I was in very much and soreness in pain.
THIS IS A FUNNY VIDEO
i broke a bone when i was 2 lol
One time in school I was playing tag with a friend then when my free time was over the teachers blew their whistles and I looked over at them then looked back and fell on concrete floor and busted my chin and it took one month to heal plus another month for my scab to fall of.

Isolate "x" on one side of the algebraic equation by adding the negative number that appears on the same side of the equation as the " x." For example, in the equation "x - 5 = 12" , rewrite the equation as " x = 12 + 5"  and solve for "x." The solution is "x = 17 .

Why does brysons eye in his hair
But have you ever scorpioned so hard the board touched the ground and flipped you over?
I can feel the pain from this video
i fratured a thumb
I have a cooler eyebrow scar
The worst pain I felt when I was a kid is when I went to the ocean and then while I was swimming I kicked a coral and then somehow a coral went inside my foot and I got infected so then my mom brought me to the hospital so the doctor could cut threw my FLESH and take out the coral and now I have a giant scar on my foot :)
Ok, video was good, but too many M E M E S, chill with the memes boi
I broked my arm when i was 5 years old i was jumping on my bed while my dad was playing with his feet by kicking them around my feet while i try to miss them ( IN MY SIDE OF THE STORY ) My dad kicked me off of the bed and made me hit my arm on a iron part of the bed than i went- 2:23  ( In my sisters side of the story ) While we were playing that game i feel off while i was doing so and hit my arm on a iron piece of a glass table.
This kinda reminded me of happy tree friends :>

Fun fact about me is that I can do a scorpion on command and I’ve done it so many times that I doesn’t hurt my back anymore
Bryson: mooooom? Mom:yes? Bryson: I am losindgblood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if YOU my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that i can continue this mortal journey rather then ending it prematurely due to loss of blood. what he really said: AaAAaaAaAaAaAAaAAaAAH!!!!!!!!!!!
For Example 0:38

I’ve been injured plenty I don’t even remember all of them between my broken bones sprains and times I went unconscious and falls and I’m only 10

loud is funny
NOW THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE.
P A I N  by the way I have a scare
your animations are getting ALOT funnier then they should.and these stories are quite relatable for me. the door one was SO me. it worked different but still painful and the same. keep at it, bryson!
I've had a ceiling fan fall on my head and now I have stitches on my eyebrow and STAPLES on my scalp
4:11 OK, the vid is all good, but I don't really believe the fact that your face was bleeding from one single hit, even though I have to admit it can be possible in a way that you had full speed on that tackle
Fun fact: you feel no pain when breaking a bone, only misery.
Merry early Christmas
I broke my ankle 3 times before I was 14

Funny story when I was around 5-6I think I was at my grand parents house and being the young kid I was (I’m 14 now) I ran straight head first down the shirt mountain that had in their backyard, so as running there was a car with a trailer at the end.  I head ran head first into a trailer light.  I went back up the hill into the house then walked to grandpa and after removing my hand from the scar a bunch of blood just plowed out.  I was rejected from 3 mini clinics till I made it to a actual hospital and had to get stitches.  I still have the scar today under my hair
I love how many meme sound u add in ur vids
I got stabbed in the forehead and it left a big scar
I laughed so hard this video I nearly pissed myself
I experience the pain. One time me and my dad was going to a lake to ride a bike and I fall cause of oversteer my bike. My body fully froze in pain and my bone like a car crash. With out my 3 layers helmet with a glass I survived

I broke my arm as a baby
*I once was sitting in that hamper thing you put your dirty clothes in and I was rocking it back and forth and my head hit the end of the wall which was surprisingly kinda sharp. I had to get stitches and the school told everyone that they couldn't touch it. My idiot friend decided to hit the back of my head. I had to go to the hospital again and get it stitched up. My brother also as a kid once ran into a metal fence and he couldn't stop running because he didn't notice at first. He got stitches on his whole face.*
0:40 bro has elastic cake O___O

Tbh when you got that scar I thought that the punching bag would hit you when it moved out of the way

Yes pain, I've felt (and am feeling) every bit of it. In my journey of this ongoing mortals life, I once fell of the 3rd floor balcony, luckily none of my bones broke but I had severe head pain, and my ankle got twisted and I got a sprain near by waist....at least I was alive and out of hospital! No. I had been admitted to the hospital as I was very young that time. Man it sucked.
Hammerific (also in the beginning i thought that there was going to be the smash thing were if you fall off a stage that thinger thingy thing happens yeah someone tell me in the comments)

The one with the blood in the head that Bryson is actually not a joke I experienced it. I was like 5 yrs old and I was playing hide n seek with my cousins but nobody really cared  so I thought they wanted to so I ran and I look back and keep running until I accidentally hit my head on a metal bar with a sharp corner I just saw there was red liquid dropping at my eye and it was red I just hold my head and I saw red and I was scared of blood ever since "until now" this isn't a joke so please believe me I'll be making an animation but it'll take a lot of time bc Im still a newbie
I fell pain

When I was a child I was visiting my dads friends house and they had a trailer with a very heavy door. Then I opened the door stuck my child fingers in there and then my weak ass child hands couldn’t hold open the door and the door sung closed because it would spring back closed at Mach 3 and clamped shut of my hand and my dads friend just stood stood there telling me to chill and he was going to open it and not opening it for like 3 4 minutes.

Spraying something hurts more than braking a bone it is fact and I would now and so would scientific studies there for if you have never sprayed something but broken a bone you are lucky
The worst pain I ever felt was literally scalping  my knee on a mat At a hockey rink at my brothers game it was one of those mats that are like meant to remove and melt snow so it was very rough it hurt
Me when someone slaves the door with my finger in it doom:ost.the only thing they fear is you

Hey, did you ever know a kid named Sidney, Brison?
Ah yes I had no helmet when I was a baby my pfp is a legitimate pic of my head shape
Actually your back is supposed to do that, it’s just that you’ve never done it before.
I like how he just said a Mario voice line:ima tired!
One time when I was sledding i hit a rock and I was tumbling over the hill and got a few minor injuries, still staying sturdy but of boy the pain was like if I got twisted and bent.
“3:21 I can relate”
So funny with d shark
Mentally or physically?
Butt where is naruto
If you remove all of your bones you still have a funny bone because it's a nerve. You dummy.
Bruh da booty cheeks had me dying
I’ve never had stitches, bee, wasp, or hornet stings, or any injuries. BUT  I one time I passed out and toppled over the coffee table. My brother put me in a head lock that was also around my mouth and one of my barely moving teeth were knocked out. I’ve stubbed my toe more times than I can even remember  I’ve fallen down the stairs twice I once slipped, skinning my knee and calve on my dads boat twice in one day. I once ran on concrete really fast and I got a massive gash in my knee. My sister once tried poking the back of my throat with a glow stick  And lastly, and worst of all, my parents went through an extremely nasty divorce that I’m still trying to get through to this day and it’s been almost 6 years. Yay hurt.
Hahaahahaha
Fun fact: The funny bone is not a bone. It's a nerve.
Fun fact: Hitting your funny bone has the same amount of dolimentary (Pain in numbers if that makes any sense) As getting the electric chair  So thank god we only feel it in our arm for about 5 seconds
Lol
Im 10 and guess what? I was hit by a motorcycle almost fell from a mountain Twice and swallowed a cent..Whatdya think?

0:40 O.o Edit: i broke my right arm
You are a strong independent girl
I haven’t been hurt before  We can change that, proceeds to snap neck
I’m only 12 so I’ve had 4 major injuries in my life. 1. Once when I was 6 I was running around on concrete with my arms in my shirt. I tripped on a rock and since I couldn’t use my arms I fell with full force, splat into the rocky ground. 2. I was 5 and I was running down a hill. I didn’t know I’d go faster, so I kept going. Again I tripped on a rock, but all the force went to the sensitive part of a knee. It hurt. 3. I was running around and someon ran into me. I fell fast and it went straight to the elbow. I still have scar tissue today. 4. I left a weight on a door and when I opened the door, a 10 kg weight went splat in the space between my toes.

Ngl puberty hit bryson like a cotton ball
The funny thing is that when I was three or two I fell off of the bay in into rocks and I hurt my entire face but mainly my eyebrow I have a scar on my eyebrow and it’s very visible and the fact that Bryson said that he had to be held in a restraining jacket when he was at the hospital when I was three or two and my incident happened they had to put me and a restraining jacket to and I also have a scar on my eyebrow and it cut through my eyebrow and it looks like my eyebrow is cut off at the end so it’s kind of funny
No one just no one  Bryson when he’s fighting: BITES OF DUST
Wow I can not stop laughing

I used to play hockey and one time in middle school we got done with a practice. I had m skates off and the guy sitting next to me was taking his off. Eventually for some reason his skate(still on his foot) came down and he basically stomped on my foot with an ice skate. Surprisingly nothing broken. Nothing terribly damaging

I have scrapped my whole body
I love how Bryson has fortnite as chapter 2 season 3 not chapter 2 season 5
I’m losing blood at an alarming rate, and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood. -Bryson 2020
I made ur brainOwO
Hey the same thing happened to me the door one but my middle finger snapped in half
Bryson: 1:19 Dancers: *DID I S T U T T E R*
Me: I can only remember ever sword of breaking my foot I might have not even broken it and smashing my finger in a car door and that didn't even break my finger and maybe falling down from my bunk bed believe me my brother has had it much worse on him he's cracked his skull before  Bryson: hold my beer    Also that doctor sounds evil
I once cracked part of my skull by falling off my couch as a baby, and split my entire bottom lip in half, when I was about three years old.
The amount of memes

The door hinge thing happend to me but only hit my right thumb
Bryson: When your young your bones are soft     Me: Really? THEN EXPLAIN THIS *Shows my arm that i broke when I was 2 years old*
You want to learn how to juggle? boom! You want to learn how to cook?! boom! You want to get your ex girlfriend to come back too bad s h e i s n ' t c o m i n g b a c k b u d d y .
I also never broke a bone. I thought I broke my leg a long time ago, but it was my hip and it only had an infection.
You are so funny
Bryson: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Bryson:  basically Dead  Bryson: *scream*
God be like:HOW THE HECK IS HE STILL ALIVE!?
How did u become so good?
Not that K.O. thing again
"time to show him whoes in charge"
The screaming is very funny
The girst one reminded me of a story that happened only a few weeks ago...  So... i was living in an rv, and i was sleeping in a loft bed. I was at the edge, and at the middle of the night, needed to go to the bathroom. I was still half asleep and didnt fully realise i was in a loft bed... so i put my arm down on what i thought was ground... and it wasnt... so i went tumbling 5 feet downwards thankfully i landed on my back, so i had no brain damage, and no broken bones... i was just hobbling to my mother and calmly said   I am in pain   She was freaking out, we didnt need to go to the doctor... but i havent slept in the loft bed since
At first i hate this video but all of the pain is making me laugh and Click the like button.

Story time. This story takes place in the 4th grade when I was in gym playing some basketball, when suddenly my right foot bent inwards and I stretched a ligament. I was crying at the fact that I "broke" my leg when suddenly a fire alarm went off. I was then carried to the recess bench and then was taken to the hospital and got a cast The end Btw if you have felt this pain your not alone K bye guys :)

One time when I was five my family was moving. It was the winter, and our sled was frozen in the snow. I remember vividly sitting behind my cousin as dug out this sled with a metal shovel she shouldn't have been using at 7 and swinging it back and hitting me. I split my lip, blood was everywhere, I had to get stitches, but now, like you, I got a cool scar. Sweet deal if you ask me. I don't even remember it hurting for very long

Some story of mine: The most effective pain I got, I’m saying “Effective” because I had to go to the general office in school. Yes. In school. During PE, We were balancing some floorball balls on a plastic paddle. It was my turn and when the I heard the whistle, I swiftly ran until I hit my classmate, Clovis on his back and as I was wearing glasses, my glasses hit the side of my eye. I had a small cut and a few scratches. And I cried, A lot. Two of my classmates, Paris and Furisha, Ran to me and try to tell them what happened.   Me: **Inaudible sadness**  Soon enough, I went to the general office to get some ice and sat there for 2-3 minutes. I went back to the basketball court and sat on the stairs watching the others play. A girl meagen was there and we just...flicked a bunch of floorball balls everywhere. And...Thats how I had pain :)
I think this part is funny 4:24
*now this is how you clap c h e e k s*
Hey Bryson when you said that the door smashed your fingers. Well that happened to me to.

Bryson: *breaks bone in intro* Me: Wait that's illegal
1:57 This happened to me too. I know how it feels. When it happens, you just feel pure PAIN
The worst injury I ever got:  I remember I got this injury when I was like 3 or 4, I was New Zealand and needed to go the toilet. But when I opened the slide door, I accidentally closed it on my finger, and believe it or not, I broke my fingernail to the door. I got a bandaid on my finger and it took like a week to heal it.
I almost broke my arm when I was 5 and almost snapped my damn back at the age 9
I have a loft bed :D

Wtf is that kid u beat ok
i once kinda broke my ankle whilst jumping on a trampoline. i was with my two siblings, and my older cousin (like wayyy older, adult), and my cousin bounced us- or tried to. what actually ended up happening was he bounced my siblings, and i got no bounce, which made my ankle go *snap.*  it was literally bent over completely sideways, big ouchie. so i went to the hospital, yada yada yada, and had to get a cast. and a few weeks later, the doctors were like "hey the last cast didnt work because we hecked it up or something lets do it again" so i got another one. my foot is fine now, i just dont like trampolines.
OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

This is baby pain I'm about to mention. So in 6th grade, I was annoying some kid (I was annoying kid and didn't know how to react because I was at a new school and all the people there were mostly strangers to me) anyway, He punched me square in the face during my first period class (P.E.). The teacher didn't see it and I didn't feel the pain right away and I was no snitch so I didn't tell until the school day ended, in which I felt the pain of it in my cheek. I consider it baby pain because yeah it hurt but compared to other people in the comments, they had worst.
I like when people say they have never broken a bone and theres me who broke three like.. Lucky

How Come I Broke A Bone When I Was 2 In A Car Accident? Have I Been Misinformed?
Can I be a animater for you haminatons?
I have a loft bed I sleep in sometimes in my room, before it was put in my Dad took out my ceiling fan because it was dangerous to my loft since it was so close to it. But that's not what got me, what got me was when I was using a step stool to get on top of my loft bed, I had done it before many times... but this time I was in a rush going down so when I went down my left leg forced it to fly forward as my left leg went around my art desk... my right leg wasn't so lucky and I ended up hitting my shin square in the middle as a small scar was formed, including on the way down I fell on my tail bone. Another time I hit my elbow at a decent rate on a door frame while going backwards... it felt like a whole rush of prickly blood was going through my arm.
I feel pain, all I have is pain, all I know is pain

I would agree I had just broken my toes and both sides of ankle over last summer and I did it all at the same time because I was big dumb and though I could ride a scooter at top speeds and the scooter went up and I went back and my left foot went under me
Hmm makes me think about a Roblox game what was it could again break ur bones lol u know at the intro
Baby minding it’s own business   Bryson:  C O N E

Wow, Skillshare is really spreading themselves all across youtube, aren't they?
Many people break there toes without realizing
What an intro
Bryson inflicts more pain in this episode than he will ever experience
2:41 bonk
What if people goes to bed with Pajamas you can make your own ham pajamas
Don't say that you have never broken a bone. Trust me I went to my mom and said"y mom,and I LUCKY that I never broken a bone? And guess what happened the very next day? I BROKE MY ARM!!! Life LITTERALY JYNXED ME. Why does life do this to me?! I still laugh about it to this day.
Hey! Guess what? I got bitten by a dog, poisoned and almost died! And i put my fingers in a door hinge I am currently typing this with a badly grazed right knee So many more pains, i could go on and on And guess what! I’m only eleven So much more pain awaits me Y’a know what  I think I’ll do this one day
Or the time where you beat that guy up near the end......GAME
Oh don’t worry I’ve suffered from getting my fingers stuck in a car door 😀
His voice is getting lower.
This video is kinda dark
How does your bones springy?
Imagine the beginning of the episode but it's in Smash Bros.......GAME
i havent broken a bone either
me: already in a bad mood my school bully: breathes me: 0:38, 1:37,4:45
I once fractured my collar bone because of falling off my bike. I remember my dad was on the phone and saw my on the floor crying so he took me inside. I have a particularly high pain tolerance so when my mom saw my distress she freaked out since she knows this. My dad drove me to the hospital where they did X-rays and all that fun radiation stuff. They diagnosed it as a fraction and gave me a sling to wear. The next few weeks where literal hell for me as I couldn’t lift up my arms cause it would cause to much pain. Fun fact when I came inside and looked at it it was yellow around the whole area… or I was delirious from the pain
2:10
This is so funny
running out of idea's?
Also I said: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I was driving and then My car was caught flying and it stopped, it fell and I hit the ground at mach 2000
4:30 i'M a TrIed
As a fan of the movie Full Metal Jacket, 0:23 is the scream pvt. Joker  makes when showing sergeant Hartman his Warface.    Even though it propably wasn't a reference I still was amazed that I recognized that.
BRUH THOSE CHEEKS 0:40 (Put it on 0.25 speed)
I'm laughing so hard.
no one:   .Little Bryson I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you my caregiver/guardian would transport me to the hospital to heal the wound  so I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it due to loss of blood.
4:24 bryson records live in 2020 me thinks his mom actually recorded it
(Some person:wow bryson you never broken a bone before you stupid idiot bryson)(:hurts the man)
0:40 will forever be the most iconic move Bryson will ever make.
1:31 Hey that's tj toons line

my uncle once punched me in the face at 3am and I had a severe nosebleed after that, i was 10. Why? Because I yelled at my mom, and at him.
*I've had the same problem with you when I was 6* I woke up and I left my room with my dovet/blanket on my head, then since our doors would closed once we leave them after opening, my room door slammed on my fingers and I told everyone at school about how much I cried and where it got stuck.
cough cough 0:40 cough cough
Everyday I somehow manage to hurt myself I almost broke my ankle once

0:00-0:23 When you get hit my ice climbers mountain
That looks nasty
i hurt my teeth really hard on a pole and the dentist said “my big teeth may come out black.” lucky me, they didn’t
I almost broke my back on a little umbrella things that you would grab on to and some one would spin it
Also also... Bryson. You're about 19 years old. You should know that the funny bone is actually a nerve. I'M 12. Funny bones - sorry, nerves - are required for us to live. Sorry if I insulted you, just wanted to hit ya with a fact.
Are you going to collect those Legos I said this for a joke
Hey did you help me paint a rock and branch brook ? Cause the kid who die it with me looked like you

1:36 angry german kid.. nice
This what I feel if I play broken bones in roblox
When I was at the shops I bumped into a pole and my forehead got a cut on my eyebrow and there was a lot of blood and while I was screaming in pain a girl about the same age as I was at the time ( I was 7 ) was looking at me like I was a zombie that had just screamed in rage
Ive never broken a bone eather but ive had to go through much worse. Once when i was about six i was waiting at the door for the bathroom and my freind came out. keep in mind that this is a heavy WOODEN door. After he gets out i try to try to hold the door open with my pinky. The door slams down and it nearly cuts of the tip of my pinky. But wait thats not all. The door slamed down on the exact base of my nail causing it to POP OOF OF MY FINGER. So then i was rushed to the emergency rooom. My sister , mom, and dad wher there. I had to get liquid stiches on my pinky. Now my pinky looks weird and nail looks weird and i had to wear a cast for a week. Its been six years since the the and i still feel stupid.
#00:58 this happened when i was younger and spun around and hit my funny bone on the METAL swing set, and the  pain is the same
3:34 donald trump being reelected be like:
Wow Bryson have you got hurt why’s making this video
There is something oddly satifying about kid bryson getting hit by a ceiling fan and slamming his face on the wall.                𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗚𝗘 𝗠𝗬 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗

I don’t remember getting hurt badly in my forehead BUT I have a huge dint in my forehead (well it is the head
You haven’t been in real pain unless you run into the sharp edge of a table to your chest 3 times
Bryson i have a question. Do you animate backgrounds and movement all by yourself or do you have a team that helps?
woah, a video just about an animators life when something crashes

Im losing blood at a alraming rate and would be most grateful if you, my care giver guardian would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that i can continue this mortal journey, rather then prematurely due to loss of blood.
Grampa/Grama telling stories   This channel: U N O.  R E V E R S E .
He is an idiot I know him from 4th grade he pee in the sink and he hit a girl
The worst pains I ever experienced were animal related.  One, was when I was really young, like 6-7, I rammed my head into my dogs face, she was fine, but her teeth got me and I was bleeding EVERYWHERE. Like bad. We went to the hospital bad.  Another time was when I was super little, I opened a gas filler thingey, the ones on cars, and a swarm of wasps stung me all the way to my house. I was screaming and crying, some wasps were still on me when I went Inside.  Last but definitely not least, I was feeding a baby horse treats, that were thumb sized for some reason..  Aaaand the horse bit my thumb and lifted me off the ground. All my weight on the thumb. Nothing was broken, the horse put me down after I screamed and cried, and she even apologized. She was just a baby.
His injuries are not that fatal not even close to my injuries ,when i was 5 i got hit by a  car and two of my legs are fataly cracked . I stayed in the hospital for 3 monts 7 weeks 5 days . Now i still have pain in my legs  .

Bryson the process of removing bones causes pain too 😂, here's a hypothetical.  Would you rather: A. Remove your bones and go through surgery and try to walk without bones Or B. Be a normal person and deal with the chances of breaking your bones
Yo get those studs back quick! U need the beat percent we can get on this mission

What I find that gives me pain is when I see my dog doing that weird scorpion position but then I look and she's sleeping I don't know why but I feel a sudden pain in my back
My life so far in a nutshell. Great video! :)
Is it just me or he seems more violence-
Plus one day I was a kid I was near the pavement someone said 321 no but I went and I got hit by a car just kidding I went on a pavement and walked to the store and I walked back then a man came I pointed were I lived  and I walked back  I thanked him for his help for me but my mom was crying  I written this to tell you about my story good bye have a good day
me too
Fortnite lol so true 🤣 5:18
And this is why I do gymnastics and dance the scorpion position does not give me pain cuz I do it every single day

MY mom: No worries! Life can change!  *My life so far, and my mom causing me pain*  1:36
How about LEGO
The worst thing I've done is saw my pointer finger with a hand saw while making a spoon. The vice I was using sucked so I kinda had to hold it. There wasn't much space left on  the wood piece and I went in for a saw and boom struck the side of my left pointer finger right on the side on the first nuckle. It didn't hurt had a horrible adrenaline rush and nearly passed out but I remember I was unnervingly calm. Like the this is fine meme but with pools of blood coming out of my finger. Havent broken anything. Havent needed stitches. I did need a lot of gaws and  a lot of butterflie stitches but now I have a u shaped scar on my finger so that's a plus.
My mans almost died like 4 times and got severely injured press f to pay respects
One time when I was so young I still took showers with my sister my sister accidentally shoved a leg shaver-thing and it shaved my toe. Now i got a big scar there  it really hrt i screamed lol  i sat in bed all day with icecream tho
I once sprained my wrist by tripping over an open drawer. Yup. That happened.
Oof

Him: mooooom?  Her: wassup honey? Him: I am losing blood at an alarming rate and would appreciate if you, my parental care giving unit would transport me to the nearest urgent care center so i can receive the treatment my wounds require so I can continue this journey of life instead of ending it prematurely due to my loss of blood.       Her: wtf 🙃
Why are still here... JUST TO SUFFER *And be Hamminations and fell off a mountaim*
Omg I have a similar way I had stiches
Hey this is really sad I watched a video about you might like you like dogs more than cats and this was above a dog named Dave isDead now because of me basically a bunch of pillagers came to kill me and Jay was going to kill the last one and I was trying to help David and I accidentally shot him with my arrow and killed him so he died and that made me sad show make a great friend and also this was made in Minecraft
I have Scoliosis and my back can do that by my own will
1:37 😂😂😂😂 pain 😂😂😂😂😂
My worst injury so far :  I went on a school trip and we went roller skating(I don’t/didn’t know how to skate) .I was having fun until I finished eating lunch and where we were eating they had a slope (it would have been fine if I was walking but I still had my skates on). so I decided it would be a GREAT idea to go down the slope with skates on when I didn’t know how to skate. So I did and I slipped and me being the Big Brain human I am I put my hand down to break my fall and suddenly I felt this OVERWHELMING PAIN in my hand. Somehow I didn’t break it and just sprained it also I didn’t go to the hospital either and now a couple years later I still want to roller skate. Moral of the story I don’t learn my lessons and don’t do that unless you know what you’re doing  🤩👍
F
Bryson: Talks about injuries  Me: eh, I can relate Edit: I also have a scar above my eyebrow (I got a phone thrown at me at the zoo)
That happens to my fingers too except my finger nails got..... I'd rather not say
I always hitted my funny bone at my desk in school and gave me that tingle...oof-
Oh god, one of them is relatable. Once I put my pinky through the hinge of the cupboard so my mum was hanging clothes. And without seeing my finger, she shut the cupboard and..it hurt a lot.
I love this kid

The man ain’t okay after that beginning scene
I didn't even know that was a thing they could do. I was fully conscious when I got stitches.  I was taking out the trash at 7 in the morning in my bare feet. In the snow. I thought it would be fine, but I slipped. There are a lot of rocks around our yard to make it look prettier. I cut myself on one, right in the middle of my knee, so when I got stitches, I was limping because I couldn't bend it. I looked like a moron in school, then dropped all my books on my knee, yanking the stitches and bleeding through the band-aid through the gauz that was wrapped around my leg three times. I got to stay home the next day and after that was Christmas break. Wait- that means 2 years ago tomorrow I got stitches.
Bryson has ended 2 people with the making of this video 0:38 4:46
Let's just appreciate I was his first unsubscriber

Me having a normal day at school* The PE announcement system:The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

Ahh, pain. Imagine breaking a bone! It’s something that has not, and will never do so.
"No pain, no gain."
Your poor mother
i read the whole description and am now immune to the next pain i experience
I never broke a bone too    Plz pin me
ok so once when I was in third grade, I was playing that game where you go through the swings while people were using them. what fun! but yeah i was going through doing pretty well until I got to this one girl swinging, I overestimated my speed amd ended up getting bulldozed like I went flying
Smooth pain! 🤕😃 🧠

IDK about you but haminations has gotten less entertaining for me. The reason for this is that in his more recent videos he use a lot of sound effects that were not his voice and...ALL OF THEM WERE REALLY LOUD SCREAMS. Make this comment stand out more so haminations can stop
you took my name
4:28 I did not expect Mario’s voice
ive broken toes, fingers, both my legs, my arm, and i have lots of scars
times i got hurt because nobody asked lol 1: I dont remember much, but, i was on my bed (it was raised im pretty sure) and i went... (i fall) and broke my arm 2. so, it was december near christmas and i was super excited to decorate my tree, so since my decorations are in my attic, i was running super fast for a five year old. I made it to the stairs and you know what happened. i broke my arm 3. this one is stupid but... It was my birthday and i was being an idiot rocking on a shelf, it fell and it hit me. I think the worst i had was a bloody nose for some reason. side note: these are just major ones i remember or have been told by my parents.
I got stuck on a gate and mouth and ear was bleeding
4:28 IMA TIRED
i broke my arm the age of 7            god said so

This is painful (ow) but it funny 🤣🤣
I remember once I almost broke my back bone.   So I was at Fox ridge (yes I live near there) and I was at the TOP of the swirly thing you could climb and that thing was slippery. So I fell down and smacked my back agents a poll. It hurt so bad.
They put me in a shtray jacket or bed
the start would be perfect for a smash bros voice saying game and the explosion happening when you fell off screen
felt that all the time
Your bone might not break but...                              HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD?!?!?!
Me: *hits funny bone* My entire nervous system: 0:30
i have a story: one time i was punched in the nose by a bully at my school and he made it bleed really bad(he punched my nose about 2 times during the school year.)but at first i did not feel pain,so i walked up to one of my friends and asked "is my nose bleeding?" he screamed and ran away...i think his scream meant my nose was bleeding.long story short i got help by someone at my school.
UR a TROLL
is it me or his voice is getting deeper
Soooo you never learned your lesson
Soooo you never learned your lesson
My dad told me when I was a baby, I was teasing my dog,  Lexi with a ball, sorry I forgot how to spell the dog’s name, wait is there other was to spell Lexi? Well any was, I was teasing my dog Lexi with a ball, but then Lexi was going for the ball. Then her tooth went into my head, and now I have a scar on my head.
Broken bones are nothing, two words, no, four words, kidney stones. Edit:if anyone has objections, trust i have broken a rib, and have had 2 kidneys stones.

During my first year of snowboarding almost every day my head slammed into ice patches and once I whipped out, lucky me it got my stomach instead of my head so after my coach asked a few questions and I had a breather, I was down the hill. This is my second year and all my skiing years did nothing for me. Absolutely nothing, curse my scoliosis. Oh and once someone was close to slamming into me at a high speed because I fell

Wanna know something? I cut my finger on a bike gear! Here’s how it happened. Me and my friends were playing outside along with my brother. and somebody came with a bike. Then we started walking to the house where a kid was moving. We looked into there recycling can. We find tons of cardboard. One of my friends say that they saw on YouTube that when you put cardboard in a specific spot of the bike wheel it would sound like a motorcycle. We all thought it would be cool and started placing the cardboard on the bike. But then I wanted to help so I picked up a little piece of cardboard as my friends were placing cardboard on the other side of the wheel. A kid said to move the bike to see if it would sound right. But my finger was right next to the gear, and when they moved the bike the gear cut straight thru my finger and I was screaming “ MOVE IT BACK!!!!!!!!” When they did I find blood dripping from my hand I pull it back and then.... I see a white part in the deep part of all the blood. I scream while running back to my house. I finally go to the door and I started pounding on it. My parent eventually open the door to see me crying and holding my hand. We had to wash it and my dad brought a red towel to hold it. My parents and I rushed to the car and drove to the hospital. It didn’t I was just really traumatized. And now I got this scar on my finger.
No one:    The thumbnail:      Deku: finally someone feels my pain
Is he dead- No. Aw..
*falls down mountain*        I’m good- 😃 I’m okay yeah- 😀

Story time: ok so this one time when I was probably 7 years old, I was being a little dick at the grocery store with my mom and sisters. When we got home, I was still being annoying as fuck, and my mom wouldn't take it anymore. We walked through the door, and I said something I thought was funny but was just really, really annoying. (Ok before we move on let me just say that the top part of our kitchen chairs are squared, metal, and sharp as FUCK. Now back to the story). Anyway, my mom just SLAMMED and I mean S L A M M E D my head into one of those chairs, and I bled right from my eyebrow. I was crying and was screaming, (I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD) "AHHHH I'm gonna die, in gonna die!" But then we just washed it off and slapped a band aid in there, and I was just fine.   Fin.

You think you’ve seen true pain? I got a gash in 4th grade.
U should see jaidens animations video of when she got the hives...she said it was very painful  Edit:  Once I was at school and was in the playground. it has a little slope of spiky rocks that leads to the junior playground which has a fence near it.what happened was I was with my friend Kyle pretending  to search for gems but I slipped and hit my head on the rocks and the fence.  I was bleeding and had to have a bandage where the mark was and I had to go home... I got to  watch the titanic/my fav movie and got a creme egg.  There's my story  of pain
Bryson: **painfully falls down a cliff in the beginning** Me: *GAME!*
bryson bro slams brysons fingers in door  me last slaming my hand locker door   me:FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Bryson is right even if you haven't broke a bone your pain in still relevant like I've never broke a bone but I've had pain throughout my body that felt like I was die ing
Once I fell in to a bush😓
I’m losing blood at an alarming rate and would be grateful if my caregiver guardian would transport me to the hospital to heal the wounds so I can continue this journey rather than ending it prematurely due to the loss of blood.    Was I close enough?
Pain share time

I jammed my wrist falling into a chair from a trampoline (it was near the trampoline..) And then I rolled off and my head CRUSHED my wrist! Although, imma say it. The pain was nowhere NEAR as bad as I thought it would be!
We have quite a lot in common, once on my first day of school my young self was like,”screw walking :>” and ran as fast as I could tripped and fell into the table ;-;. I screamed as loud as I could as I saw blood going down my face and I had to get it hot glued together :<. It turns out it is quite cool having a scar on your head,my scar is on the left side corner of my noggin :>
one day my mom said my full name once    true story.
You know I still have the scar from when I was like three or two and I kept just like bumping my eyebrow and I'm 8

Can some of us agree that no matter how bad we have gotten hurt, we have never broken a single bone in our body. Cuz I have sprinted down a hallway  and tripped on a kid, AWHO WAS SLIDING ON A CHAIR, and all I ended up with was a very scabbed, bruised, purple knee.       I also realized how lucky some peeps are. OwO

Man I never. Get. Hurt unless I hurt myself
so have any of you watched a video on being clumsy and all that other good stuff. well im the kid that is constantly falling down the stairs or ramming my elbow into the door handle. ive done it so much that my family knows me as the person thats always getting hurt. so i agree with Bryson when he says to get rid of the funny bone.
well,when i was a small bean/little kid i got my leg hurt by a FAN! it hurt a lot more than a cut that was little! and i,used to have that as a scar but now,it was gone then i got A BIGGER CUT! i run to fast a fell,i was almost about to cry. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

HAMINATIONS IS BACK AND HE IS FUNNIER THAN EVER ITS BEEN ONE YEAR SINCE YOUR LAST VIDEO

Lol I love getting hurt bc I for some reason love going to the hospital XD
Lol I remember slamming a heavy metal door on my finger then loosing my finger   *good times*
Ngl pain is painful
He sounds like 14 when he's 19?  In this video https://youtu.be/1KkyN622MYo he sounds like he was 11 when he was 16  I wonder how tall he is now
one time when i was in 5th or 4th grade, my brother was chasing me and i tripped and skinned a finger which was probably the most pain i've ever felt in my life so far  i also accidentally spilled hot boiling water on my left hand yesterday, that gave me a 1st degree burn that was the second most pain i've felt in my life so far. nice.  UPDATE: I STILL HAVE THE BURN MARK AFTER 5 MONTHS- ITS JUST REALLY FAINT
Lb sans: First time?
I never broken but I have been stabbed before by a hook on my toe
Well that intro was a first
"Although I have never broken a bone..."  *proceeds to snap some guy's neck*
Me: *has gum* Everyone else: can I have some? Me: no  Everyone: 0:39
Your pain is insignificant compared to mine, i actually got the skin on my leg to melt by touching a bike's exhaust, and the other time i no joke almost drowned to death, i was literally knocking on death's door.
yeah i slammed my finger in a door once And i broke it
Pain sucks
That angle has a big grudge on bryson
Hahahahahhhaaahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhah
Why do you always make other people animate your video's? But you also sometimes "animate" your on videos? Sometimes it will switch in the video. i wwouldn't but so mad if you just had people animate your videos in toher videos but "animate" your own sometimes. But if your going to make so you switch animation styles mid video im going just get more mad. The backrounds also are way better than the animation sometimes. I wish you could actually try improving inste dof making other people do your backrounds and aniamtion. You can't call yourself a story aniamter when you don't animated your video's. Please try and improve Bryson,

You have seemed to scream *9 times in this video*
Does skill share have aerial silks classes?
me too
Hey this happened to me at my friends house, that person had a bunk bed in their room me and my friend were playing on the top and the felling fan was high. I was crawling and hit my head. At first I didn’t fell it until my friend point it out. I was screaming, when I went to the emergency room apparently I got a wound luckily it was not that deep so I didn’t get stitches. And that is why I am scared of bunk beds next to a celling fan.
I saw this video in my recomended and i was in a busy and i forgot what the name was and i tried to type haminations on YouTube and i typed   Haminsyons, suprisingly it still worked
Why do people call fortnite fartnite
bruh the beginning was a rolling girl clip
THE SOUND EFFECTS SENT ME
Bryson!!! The amazing butt clapper of the century!!!
U know wut else hurt? Medical massages. U know how sometimes in some people where when you squish ur arm or thigh, some bumps come out and its just... bumpy? So basically, i had to get all those popped... by massage... EVERYWHERE! I went to this massage place and so i took my clothes off but i had shorts and a sports bra on. I got on d table or wutever and there he starts with. My calve. And oh i saw jesus. Wut hurt most was d inner side of my knees and it BRUISEDDD FOR DAYS. I went in for 2nd time and i need to go for 3rd cuz he said so. My back was d least painless, most pain was leg, arm, and stomach. Oh jesus i cried. Said my pancreas was ass and kidney too cuz of idk acupuncture points or wuetever.    Another pain story: i got my gut checked. Basically they didnt give my anesthesia and checked mt gut. I was 7 or smthin. I get on d table and they were like, u see this rod with a flashlight? And im like mhm. Theyre like, its SoFt. Im like, mhm so? And theyre like open ur mouth. And all went to hell. I open my mouth and they put it in and i started to gag and they kept checking my stomach for a gud 10-15 min and finally as i was about to die and they were like gud job. They take it out and theyre lke, u have a bad cold... death.    Another pain story: surgery. I got into a tiny surgery. Basically smthin was growing on my back and mom popped it 2x but a 3rd one popped out and it was huge so we went to d doctors. They give me anesthesia and open it up and stuff d hole which was cut open with bandages and fix me up. It hurt to walk, sleep, sit or anything for a few days and we went back for d 2nd checkup. He asked me if he can give me anesthesia and d younger me thought, since he is asking, maybe it wont be so bad? So i said nah to the anesthesia. Boy i mad a mistake. I get on d table and lie stomach down. And there it came. He take d bandages out of my back with a cold clipper or wutever. And i feel everything to d nerve. I but my already scarred hand by iron and finally it finished. D table full of blood and ooze juice wutever and d bandage was like a foot long. Lkke how did it fit in dat hole? I have 3 scars on my back now 😂   Another pain story: i cant remembee this one. Basically when i was 2 or younger or at d age of when i was crawling. Someone left the iron on and went somewhere and i was crawling and magically hit the table and d iron fell on my right hand. I cant imagine d pain cuz i dont remember it but whenever hot oil jumps or hot water drops on my skin it stings as bad so i cant imagine d hot ass iron on my fucking hand. I probably passed out or smthin. I got a bigass scar on my hand which mom thought wouldnt stretch out as i grew and would disappear but obv it did not. It aint so bad but its stkll noticeable and big.   Another pain story: first time cramping. So i was in a bball game. We were losing to another school and holy bad news. My calve started to cramp up and it was my first tome cramping up so it was new to me and my nerves was as nerving as possibly. My coach came to massage it and it did help but wen it got better i trjed to stand on my own but it started to cramp again and she was like u fricking idiot and started to massage till it got a lil better. I couldnt walk for a few week.
Awesome

If you lose your funny bone witch is actually a nerve you won't be able to control your pinky or ring finger
Once I was at my friend's house, and we decided to play a game where we would go on a mattress and whoever fell on it would lose. When it was my turn, I was going against my older brother. He accidentally pushed me too hard, and I ended up hitting the corner edge of a wooden table on the side of my head. I was crying in pain, and luckily I didn't need staples. They gave me a cream to put on two times a day for every day, and it went away. I still have the bump on my head today. I also once was at a golf store with my dad, and there were these cool virtual golf things you could do by using a driver and hitting the ball virtually. I watched my brother do it a little too close, and then I was hit in the head by the driver. It was not fun.

Actually Bryson, the funny bone is actually your ulnar nerve that controls the movement of your fourth and fifth fingers. (If you already know this, I apologize and know it's a joke but I was raised to check everything with scientific facts. Have a great day!)

What is extremely weird is that snowboard one literally happened to me yesterday i think I have a concussion
Bryson:I hate pain Me:but I like it
Hey Bryson, So funny story i also have a scar but its on my left eyebrow. What happened was that I was at teeball (keep in mind i was a wee little 6 year old) and it was my turn to go swing but the dude ahead of me was practicing his swings and he didn't notice me and a metal bat slammed into my head busting it open. The only i can remember is that I got jack in the box after the surgery and I woke up once during the surgery. Hope you see this. -Hyperninja

Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior

I haven't broken a bone nether
Yeah.
Once I went to the top of a staircase and I did a cool “ninja” jump and I fell and was going down the staircase painfully and once I think in that timing on one of the steps of the staircase I went upside down with my head being the only the thing that kept me up and I am yet surprised on how I didn’t break any bones.             But it still really hurt

An electrical fire on my arm? Yea I... I know what it feels like it hurts soooo frikin' much.
Let’s just appreciate that Bryson used the Minecraft walking on grass sound in the beginning
Here is a list of pain I encountered/witnessed  One time I had to really use the bathroom and I was speed, until my turn was too sharp and I ran into the doorframe  This one time me and my brother were jumping on my bed and then he leaned against the wall, but little do we know there were nails on the wall and it left a big scratch on his head  My brother closed the door on my fingers while I was touching the things  Also a car door smashed my thumb and the pain looked like.... uh  I sprained my ankle and now it will start hurting very very badly if I try to run  My fat brother fell onto the side of my head and pushed one of my earrings, creating a bigger hole in my ear, I had to push the earring back in place  This isn’t pain but I choked on a grape and nearly died  I have a big fear of pain and if I see anyone going thru a disgusting amount of pain then I’ll feel it and crawl up and cry like a baby
I shut my finger in a car door once that freaking hurt

Ah yes pain I’m already pain
The most intense pain I've had is when i sprained my wrist  Wanna hear the story- no? Too bad im gonna take my time here and type it all out cuz I've got nothing better to do-  So me and my dad were on an adventure and found a REALLY steep hill, this was my second time going down it so i was ok with it. I went speeding down and right at the end, when the ground was flat, my scooter decided that it hates me and stopped working, i started swerving and BAM i crashed it someone yard, road burn on my shoulder and knee, and of course, my sprained wrist- it was so bad i couldn't get up, turns out the people heard me screaming and had to give me a ride home-  *my parents decided that it was better to not tell me i sprained my wrist-*

agk1:36
Remember When Bryson used to make his characters very geometric and didn’t use sound effects
Story time: when i was in 2nd grade we had this really long path of concrete that led us back to class from the play ground so we were running back to class  and then someone bumped into me and I fell. Now you might think I just scraped my knee but no I landed on my wrist and I scraped it yes it was bloody so I went the nurse and got a bandage but it wasn’t until my after school karate lesson my wrist hurt. Like really bad on my wrist bone. And then I realized I just sprained my wrist
Aye I got a scar on my eve brow to here’s the story: my dad and my brothers were double jumping on our trampoline side note: my dad is six feet so I thought I wanted a turn and we left the net on the trampoline open then I got double jumped right into our metal basketball goal and I was eight so I thought that that was the end of me but I’m still fine luckily we had some stuff in one of our medicine cabinet so it helped but man I must’ve ear raped them so bad I was just like AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! And my dad kept on saying I’m sry I’m sry I’m sry and ya my family is kinda like brisons there’s a lot of fighting but that’s how we show love and my family always makes up for it and when someone gets hurt rlly bad we make such a big deal well that’s the story

My soul. Oooooooooh my soul! It has been blessed with this auditory experience. Thank you lady, for saving my life from bigotry and injustice, to allow me to become a changed man. For this, I thank you. In addition, it would be nice of you to lend me your bank account. I need some money, and it would be a very fine thing for you to do. My family of twelve needs to be fed. Fergus, Fargo, Steve, Frank, John, and all the others would like you to give me- I mean us all your money. Also, I'm going to need your driver's license, it's for my daughter. She has always wanted to be a policeman, ever since she was about six or seven, I can't really remember- I'm an old man, barely over 15. We have come to the U.S. from Mexico due to a mishap within my family, and let's just say we ate too many turkeys for Thanksgiving. Anyway, I would also like you to send me a check of $67,000 by next Thursday at 4pm sharp. I'm rather busy and looking for an escape. I'd like to travel to Indonesia, I will start making crab rangoons with the money. I also would like to notify you that your credit card information is going to expire soon. Give me the numbers on the front, as well as the three wacky digits on the other side and I will switch your information for free, and I'll send you the link. Anyway, back to what I was saying, could you also give me a check for $84,872.92, so I can pay off the mortgage. Thanks! This video was very informative! Very good pronunciation inside of this visual experience! Immersive black background. How about that? My son Gary says that you did a good job! I hope you have a happy 4th of July! Maybe next time, letter orange? Red works too, nice talking to you! Thanks for complying with all my monetary requests! I accept. Great video btw! Another thing, my son has been talking about this new show on Netflix about a little shark who has constipation issues. He tries using various products to remedy this problem. THIS IS ENOUGH. In the finale, the shark dies and his college debts never get paid off, and he dies of constipation. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO ME! Anyhow, I am no longer in the mood for rangoons, I'm thinking maybe pad thai. Anyhoo, my grandmother just died, and we need to get her a WIFI ROUNTER NOW and pay for her funeral, but most importantly HER PIZZA GUY! WHAT IF SHE GOES HUNGRY, the country I mean. By the way, don't forget about my grandfather's ern, she really needs her fishing license. it would mean a lot for you to hand me/we your fishing license. Thank you for your compliance. P.S. my dad hasn't forgot about that vase you broke last weekend, he's pissed about it. Just as a reminder, it costs around seven grand, so good luck! I have a stomach ulcer. Did I mention that my good friend Walter is opening his very first business! HOW EXCITING! BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN, DID YOU!? The lesson we all learned today is that I deserve money, and I am glad that you agree to my terms, they are pretty meetable in my opinion. I say we meet in the middle and double the price, would you say? I think so. I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY NICE house, because I just used your credentials to buy you five multimillion-dollar houses all across India and China. You're welcome! REMEMBER, the tigers don't bite. Happy birthday!

3:28   This actually happened to me! But, What happened to me was my finger almost got completely cut off. I got stitches and now I have a scar from them. Another time I was jumping on the bed with a friend. Now, Me and my friend were around 5-6 and my older brothers were there to, Their ages being around 7-14. Me and my friend were jumping on the bed and my brothers were throwing a big inflatable ball across said bed. You know, Those balls at Wal-Mart that make the annoying sound when you bounce it. Anyways, As the were throwing it across the bed, I ended up landing on it and flew across the air, Hitting my head on my friends wooden tv stand. I had a small yet deep cut and ended getting stitches because of it. Both of mh stitches stories were because of my idiotic brain and my eldest brother. Wow.      And I still have the scar on my head-
Don't worry

Finally, a person who literally understand my pain..... No I mean it..... This is my life but filled with scars..... But it's okay :p
This is the Answer of the question 'Why wouldn't you want whipped cream?' in the video 'First job! (Work Stories)'  Ans: The problem with whipped cream is that it is a mix of sugar and fat and our body has to figure out which one to use as a form of energy. A lot of fat and a lot of sugar mixed up can rise cholesterol and triglycerides levels… And whipped cream is not precisely packed up with nutrients.
My worst injury: getting killed by firestar ; - ;

Finger trapped in the door one I experienced it
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Praise God. Jesus, who reigns, my Husband and Son of God, comes soon. USA(Babylon) will be invaded by Russia to the east and China to the west and will lose. NYC will be destroyed. Repent and focus on Jesus. Plead the blood of Jesus. Rapture is soon and the kingdom of God is near, so be holy. Obama is the antichrist and will use the rfid chip as mark of the beast with the False Prophet named Francis from Catholicism.

Me and my brothers were running around in the woods and as I stepped on a log for some reason my brain just stopped I froze in place and just fell on my face I didn't even react I was zoned out this is because my one of my brothers said a.  Word that just surprised me and I zoned out to just think about what they said after I came back to earth I felt a lot of pain then I started crying but not on the outside because I wanted to look manly

Pain
I've seen a few other people do it so here's a story I had involving pain  This story was back in 2019 around the beginning of the year, me and my friend were having a sleepover over at her house, me her and her younger brother found a mattress and propped it up on the sofa in her room, and started using it as a slide, one of the times I went down my whole body flipped while going down, and since her room had a fireplace, with a very *heavy* cover on it, that cover fell on me  Moral of the story mattresses are not slides don't use them like one

This reminds me of a TerminalMontage video.
I just broke my arm on Thursday
Must have been painful.
One of my most scarring injuries are when I was 9 I was riding on a bike then when my mother called me to come back inside when I heard my mom I decided: No mom, I will not stop, so I decided that I wanted to ride around the park I went on an overdose on riding then, when I lost lots of my balance and then, felt the worst thing possible, by falling on my knee. Leaving lots of blood, and then causing a giant gap on my knee and then now I have a pretty cool scar

Funny bones aren't even bowns there vanes
Hi, this is Anthony Widman It's difficult to get the information downloaded and sent. I'm sending a link to my Facebook where I been posting and logging the crazy for a long time. And it is crazy and off in directions a lot with many dead ends. But I'm sure I have a good idea of what it finally all means.   There is mental health issues threw out it. I've dealt with this for decades. But recently with much of thin info, the last 2 or 3 dr at the clinic have admired that I am not delusional because of issues. I have issues because it's actually true.  I have been in this controlled environment for... ever? So I'm not sure what's specific to me and what's out beyond my bubble. But the info wether real or not is there and it's existence is evidence of its existence. If it's false news it still proves some one made it regardless of content. Then there's the issue on content.   There is real things to start with. Like specific Cory records that I have found impossible to get. Any information at all of a car wreck I was in on 2002. No dr reports no transcripts nothing at all. There was a guy in the same place same crime the works. I was out in 3 on a 25-life sentence. Idk about him. I think he was a cover story for my case. The mental health program I was released to seems to have vanished all together. I called and searched to speak with one of the staff there but could only get to one county office that told me the entire program was canceled sometime after I was released. The entire program gone... with a plausible cover story why.   I do not expect this to go anywhere. I kinda expect to be found dead soon. Been posts and things suggesting suicide and I've posted the possibility of it earlier today.   No, not insane. Just facing the reality presented to me. The facts as presented offer little to no hope of any future at all for me any where. But, I'm still here for now.   Not only that but I do see the system and how it works some. From inside out. It sucks. It really does. But I also do not expect anything more than my actual or faked suicide because that's how the script presents itself. Also because of your phone #. There has been a pattern of ###-xyyz phone numbers at key places. Yours fits the pattern. So I must assume you know something in some part.  Beyond that it looks scattered and erratic I know that. It's been a difficult few years having this deprogramming shit run threw my head. But I got enough. I no longer care to care about much of anything any more. But, what happened to me. What was done is pure evil. Pure evil. And I do not care if I get killed telling this. No one should live the life I was made to live. No one should ever have to live the pain I have for decades. They can not get away with doing this to people it is cruel and inhuman. And if I was being used to do what they did to me on others, it's just wrong.   Covid... predicted in the 80's and linked to my personal story. And it IS there. Using mythology, symbols, numerology and language it's a clear code that can be documented with no clear paper trail unless you see the thread. Like patterns in phone numbers. Secret shadow government. No paper trail.   But then again... how much of it is presented just for me and mind games on me and how much is dying my limited world? I would have no way of knowing.   If you can, send a regular and I'll assert, you can see the entire profile.   Oh, and zuckenburg is a burg As in titanic and buildaburg. Part of it all. Google and all the rest of the multinational companies.   https://www.facebook.com/anthony.m.widman

No major injuries except for 3, and then I felt emotionally in pain...  1st) When I was around 10 I was riding a bike, and I was going pretty fast on it. Suddenly, the chains fell and i couldnt stop the bike, nearing a corner. I put my right leg down thinking it would slow it down a lot... nope... it flung in front of the tire, and scrapped right Into my leg. Hurt for a  week, left a huge tire scratch for 2 :l Yeah left me upset  2nd) (around 10 or 11) I asked my mom if I could walk the dog, and she said I can. Yeah after like 2 minutes I decided to jog with him. Big regret, as he sprinted and dragged me along the gravel road. My front side was ok, but my back right shoulder was very injured, like red bruised and scraped, and my hands + right knew were scrapped, not bleeding surprisingly. Yeah it burned my right shoulder though.  3rd and last one) I was playing mario sunshine, and I wanted to go to yet another freeze, so I put my controller down and tell my little brother not to touch it. Yeah I'm walking out, and BOOM! He took the whole cube and smashed my hand. Felt broken, it wasnt, it lasted a week this pain, and again, on the right side >:|
I broken a bone recently in June cuz my lazy dumb brain wanted me to hurt my self. Then I cried like a newborn baby goat. It hurt really bad. The End.

The reason why it hurts more than usual when you hit your funny bone is because your ulnar nerve runs along the outside of the bone rather then the inside.

Did you copy James' Soobway video? Lol
I have never broken a bone either.
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
im cool
The action brought about by the response of self-preservation, which is natural intelligence, is instantaneous and it is also cultivated unconsciously or consciously. Similarly, we have recorded psychological preservation, the fear of not recording and the knowledge of that gives a central feeling that you must preserve yourself and from that you act.
I can relate to the pain without the hospital.         *i fell down the stairs at the age of 5 or 6 at my old house while chasing my white cat*

When I was 7 I closed the driveway gate and slammed my thumb and my bones broke lmao. *I realized after 10 seconds. We had to go to the Hospital at 7 p.m and when the nurses said "That's alot of blood" I fainted. I still have that stitch scar on my thumb.*

I noticed that most of these things happened to you as a kid  And I was laughing at most of them  Does that mean I love watching people get injured but it’s animated?

I slammed my head into a corner of a glass table i also have a bald spot I also dont have pigment that means i have a little white hair
I slammed my finger in a car door, and  the door locked afterward, it was a fun experience
Reminds of that one time I tried learning to ride a bike at 12. I wasn't wearing shoes, didn't know how to stop so I put my foot down and ripped my toe open leaving some of my skin still on the hot ass road. Even so I still walked inside and when my mum insisted on taking me to a hospital I declined cause doctors are scary.
I liked that lego Star Wars reference
How do u not have a million u deserve it and if u don’t thank so who are you
I've never experienced any severe physical pain, but emotional pain? Oh bOI WHERE DO I START-?
Boy got hit in the head so many times- i,m suprised he doesnt have amnesia
i did not mean to put a link there
Oh yeah I broken a bone on my leg
The only major injury I have ever had is, one time I was letting my dog out but I was bear footed so when I went inside the screen went right into my ankle.it almost cut through my akelas tendon,when i got to the hospital the doctors said i was lucky because an inch in a half further in there and i would have needed surgery on my akelas tendon plus since i was on the headset with my freind he thought i was laughing until my mom took the headset and told him i had been injured.And thats my story
0:15 me trying to swim or dive,1:57 little bryson did not see the fan bc it was moving to fast and his little coins fell
Can doctors actually put You in a straight jacket
Okay I've felt most of these. And is it just me or does it hurt more when you see the blood and the huge gash when you feel and look at it? Edit: he made the baby look like one of the cone head XD
Wow
Breaking a bone includes teeth falling out
*Bryson flopping without bones* *the background " zoo No-Bones Jones!"*
I clicked this faster than Amoug us players say "Where" when a body is found.
Wow
I’ve twisted my ankle and sprained my wrist and hit my head more times than I can count   How am I not dead
It’s story time!  When i was 10, i was walking by the side of my School because We just Got Free from School, But as i was walking by, someone From inside the building open’d the window and i was waving at my bro ‘Cause he was at the bus so i didn’t see it, and i Walked right Into the window with my Open mouth. And, as you guessed, it hit and i started bleeding. Very much. And, you know that little like Meat Rope you have when you have a Open mouth? Well, that thing snapped! Luckily, some teachers found Me, and patched Me up. My Mom had to come Pick Me up and get Me to the dentist, But everything was fine, the little meat rope would re-grow since i was just A Child, and That’s Where the memory ends. Moral of the story? Watch Where You’re going, or you might break your meat rope.
I sprained my ankle during PE and I seriously thought I broke my foot and I sat in my schools medical room for 3 hours sitting down and it hurt the whole way
Your pain i-beats the meat out of the poor guy
1:49 *is that a drake reference I see* 👀

So, one time when i was 9, I went to a pool with my relatives and I wanted to exit, the thing is the pool was surrounded by concrete. And you can guess what happened. I Slipped and fell at like mach 3 and hit the hard concrete head first. It felt like all my teeth were gone, my eyesight in one eye went red for a couple of seconds, and it felt like somebody was pushing in the back of my head really hard. But I wen’t to the hospital and I was fine, but they told me if i hit it harder I probably could have died. So that was an experience.
Yes

Bryson:keeps hitting himself in the intro  and breaks his bones also Bryson:AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I’ve never broken a bone either but my family own a cottage in the woods and we ride four wheelers so this one time I crashed into my sister while driving and I went flying one of the wheels almost hit my head and crushed my skull but by some miracle the back end bounced off my thigh ( don’t ask me how I don’t know but there was a bruise with wheel ingravings on it ) and my fourwheeler went flying into a ditch instead. I then proceeded to fall ten feet into a pile of rocks. I spent 3 years drinking nothing but milk like cow milk I was obsessed so my bones are like indestructible and that must be how I didn’t brake a bone that was the closest I ever came to death. But hey I’m alive so that’s cool right?
The worst pain I’ve ever had is...      Losing my DS

Hey Bryson you probably wont read this , and honestly I'm chill with that. I have been watching your videos since 2018 and I sort of miss your OG logo style. I mean, don't get me wrong your new one is very epic! It's just....... I kind of miss the ham jumping around, spinning, then your channel name pops up on the top, it was just... Well.... I could say to my self when I saw that logo, yup that's my favourite youtuber :)))).... But anyway keep up the good work 😉🙂🙂🙂
that is what i am having right now
At last he's back!
I broke my bone twice and the second time I said: well crap
Right now I am recovering from having an aneurism from among us
When I was 2 or 3, I slammed the right side of my forehead into the corner of a mirror wall and I got stitches.
Bryson don't worry if u die u will respawn as long as u sleep on ur bed but don't sleep on hell caus the bed will explore because because ok.

Ive never broken a bone but- BOI THE PAIN. (( i don't have it as bad as others tho. )) 2 scars: one: my nose. a big o'l dog was like *nom*. ER. Its been about 6 yrs and boi you can kinda still see it! two: i got one on me hand from about, near may. I was making stuff with a glue gun. i accidentally had it on all night (( dunno why i didn't burn the house down 😎 )) and so it was pretty hot. i touched. the nozzle. and the glue was on my hand for a hot 5 seconds or two. and i went screaming bloody murder to my mom. i had ripped of the supposed glue which uh, the blister came with it o.o (( skin. )) and so uh. E.R. aswell :D  -Ps: the 2nd was at the start of covid so that made it hard- it wasn't actually that bad, (the pain and the injury only a scar.) but i recall whining "im gonna die" atleast 13 times before we got the E.R. aswell as      additional 7 times at the E.R. uwu
Why is this in my recommended list
YouTubers are jinjurki haminations is the 10 tails
Had a kidney stone? Worse then all of those
I swear, when you put your hand through the door, I swear I did the same thing.  I swear I did the same thing when I was like 8, the problem was was that my brother doesn't know any better because he's autistic.  And he closed the door, right on my fingers, and they were dark purple and black.  I'll forget that pain.
Who else laughed when he screamed at the beginning of the video
How many scream sound effects do you have saved?!
when did you add blood to your videos?

Bones have a big Majority of the blood ya know if you don’t have bones you’d die instantly ._.
The fan one is relatable
I HAVE A CUT ON THE SAME PART OF MY EYEBROW- I bumped into someone's head, and they had a very sharp hairclip on. *I NEARLY TURNED BLIND*
i hate it
The one where he got his fingers stuck in a door hinge kinda reminded me of when I bent my finger backwards on a door frame.. that was the only bone I've ever broken and I had to get a splint.
I got bleach in my eyes
That door thing happened to me
Bryson hitting his head on fan: ow. Me: Blast off!
Fun fact: I stepped on a nail once and it took weeks to heal
One time I was climbing up my bunk bed, and the fan was going. I was mad at my brother, and didn’t pay any attention to the fan, and hit my head. I have a big scab there, and it hurt if you touched it just the slightest bit
I had my hand shut in a car door did not break any thing buut THAT WAS PAINNNNNNN AND PAIN AND PAINNNNNNNN ps:  i did not go to. The hospital
This channel always makes me laugh
Same I’ve suffered a same fate as him EXEPT it felt much worse the pain was with me for an entire season
The fact that Bryson draws his little self like that vine hoodie kid is hilarious
Once I fell on my arm. It hurt. The end.

*P A I N*
I know fow that feels when something hits your funny bone
Yay a new haminations vid I really like your videos keep up the good work.
Oof I have a very hate hate relationship with pain because I have a ridiculously low pain threshold which to put a long and boring story short means that pain is amplified so much that every time I so much as stub my toe I turn into a human air raid siren because that really fricken ( I’m just going to say frick in case kids see this ) hurts which of course means that the times I’ve had injuries that would already be painful to most people are even less fun for me in fact one of the most painful injuries ( or I guess in this specific case multiple injuries ) I’ve sustained was just a few weeks ago where again to put a long story short I was running in a hallway when I fell face first onto the floor whilst still wearing a really heavy backpack that had my laptop and other stuff in it meaning that an already awful fall was even worse anyway for a solid hour I felt nothing but pain in my ribs, legs, face arms etc but the worst part was my foot all the other stuff as painful as it was weren’t all that bad and went away fairly quickly but my foot was the worst part because I was in so much pain when I tried to stand they had to get a wheelchair I then found out the next day ( because we couldn’t go to the hospital on the day of the incident cause there were no spots available anyway ) when we went to the hospital that I had straight up broken my foot hence why when I tried to stand it felt like I was triggering every single pain receptor in my body because I probably was with how excruciatingly painful it was anyway this has gone on long enough so I’m going to abruptly end it here to prevent you from losing track of time attempting to read this tschüss! ( that’s goodbye in German cause I’ve been learning the language recently )
Me when I  need a shot.   Me : I am a tired
I here this 4:30 I laugh then fart

Where twines
Your videos are really funny me and my brother love your videos
This sums up my younger sibling who frantically getting hurt
The only thing I've slightly been injured by is spraining my wrist at a skating rink
The fact you remember the pain makes me remember how lucky I am that my adrenaline kicks in within a split second so that I don't feel pain from more serious injuries. Or that my brain doesn't process it at all idk
Ham: *exists* Dwagons: *also exists* Me: This means WAR
Ohh that is cool i am not the only one got shoped bya fan................... It cut my leg, Do not worry i got a animatronic leg and yeah i felt pain at this time

Do you get a new mic or pop filter
-Laughs akwardly- i.. had alot of pain in my childhood. And now too.. ༼ つ ◕◡◕ ༽つ
Bryson i have earned so many scars from fighting alligators
Imagine having a health bar
Bryson is yoda confirmed
I once fell from the top of my bunk bed. I fell on my feet! Crazy
Once my brothers were going down the stairs (we had big stairs and it was right in front of a wall) on a box cover and once it was my turn and... you can put the picture together
Ah yes pain
The LEGO reference tho
Bryson, I had a friend from school who clames to be your cousin his name is jude can you clear that up for me please?
Memory pain  I broke a bones so now I really hurt ahhhhhhhh mom stop touching my broken legs
Once I got ran over with a four wheeler... don’t worry I had a helmet, all I got was a cool triangle cut. I was only like 6
Brayson: litttle kid bones are soft and moldable  Me: at 4 years old breaks my leg by sliping on blanket onto hard wood floor at my cousins house I also got my fingers stuck in a hamster cage
Wen brison jumps of the bunk bed ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Poor baby
I like many people have experienced pain. Like that time my hand got trapped in the hinge of a door. A *CAR* door. Or the time i tried to jump of my bunk bed and my foot clipped the rim of the bed (i was at the top btw) and i fell to the floor, and made the bed FALL ON TOP OF ME. So yeah, pain
I almost broke my fingers I was out side and I went into our camper then I shut the door on mah fingers but I was to short to reach it then my parents found me and then they open the door and took me to the hospital
I dont feel physical pain much,   but     The other pain      I feel that all day
Ur so funny
This is basically. ,all your pain in one video,
0:39 COMBO 13!
Bryson on the cover: Enthusiastic, uploads random funny animated stories        Bryson on the contents: *ok so i'll tell the endless stories of how i almost died*
i jumped off my bunk bed but the fan was not on it was pretty fun!
What is this intro? Broken bones IV?
so when i was on 1st grade me and my brother were arguing i put my tthunb in the door and he slams it. Also another time (idk when this happened) me and my brother were arguing and i did a split btw i'm a dudeso that kinda hurt
Door hinge *Oof* 3:28

Yes it seems pretty accurate cuz I've dealt with some pain like that
you say when you are younger your bones are flimsey and you dont feel that much pain huh well i got my entire hand stuck in a converer belt and a grocery store im not even jokeing
i crashed a motor bike into nettles :D
Bryson are you OK
You having a scar on your eyebrow make me happy cuz I have one to
Same
Spain with out the s
Fun fact:I once snapped my neck
Pain
I remember how my classmate his nail came off he was really calm about and he let us see it.it was really weird but he has some painful pains
One time my base ball team was at batting cages practicing and some kid was swinging his METAL bat full force and it went right into my forehead I just layed there in pain also I had a headache for 2 days straight because of that  Another time I was going down my bunk bed I was the top bunk and I didn't realize the fan was on and I put my arm out by accident and it gave a deep cut in my elbow I still have the scar   One time I had a bloody nose that was like a waterfall and it hurt ALOT I had to go to the emergency room
Here is a question for y'all, which is more painful?  a.) Papercut b.) Stubbing a toe c.) Your parents finding out you were using your DS in the middle of the night
My friends brother arm was broken because his sister sit on him, the sister was younger lol
This is so underrated
We fear the same thought      Never again will we put our hands in door hinges
The tree background vomit
This video made me laugh so much
Teeth count as bones. You've never lost teeth if you've never broke bones...
THE FINGER ONE GOT ME      This was in kindergarten, It was the end on the day and I was feeling the flat side of the place where the driver’s thingy is and my assistant teacher closed the door and closed it on my fingers and I cried but we ended up getting them out in the end It was hurtful
bryson with a beanie? impossible...
My life is the tittle's name

I actually never broke a bone but I nearly did at age 3. My mother said the damage was really close to my bones. A little deeper and I wound of broken my leg
I fell down the stairs once it hurt badly
Wouldve been funny if in the intro ham just dropped you and thats how the video  started.
Bryson: stands on a mountain Bryson again: *possibly dying*

i had the tip of my pinky finger cut off when i was 2, split open my head while on a hoverboard on boxing day and had a car thrown at my forehead that made it bleed.     why does my forehead deserve this much pain
Never say Bryson you never got any injuries or you ded as heck TvT

I have not been cursed with phisical pain, but with so much mental pain caused by 1 game, JAK 3 , this game caused so much mental pain that if it were transfered into phisical pain , it would be more painful than the opening and all the moments you punched someone , all that combined would be the phisical version of my mental pain caused by that game
Dang your good at editing and drawing and me i am really bad at drawing😟
You need to Make a Movie about The ham
I broke my collar bone by falling off my bed in the middle of the night

Is falling from a speeding horse 9 times and hitting a rock with my head pain? or falling from a huge truck face first and had to go to my own house without any help from my friends instead they walked me home and going to the hospital and hearing my mom say im an idiot pain?
I hit my elbow so hard that I had to wear a half cast and I tore so much skin to the point that you can see my tissue
FVSJI DJS THESE VIDEOS ARE AMAZING-
Him: hurts himself without doing anything too stupid Me: Runs into a glass door sonic speed only to rebound off. YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA it was safety glass so thats why it didnt shatter into a million pieces but it "hurt like a buttcheek on a stick" (if you havent seen that meme go watch it)

Are you ok..?
*Bonk*    AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
My appendix exploded
Funny bones find your pain funny
Does yall think that Bryan should wear a helmet for 2 reasons, the bald spot and you know, maybe the injuries on his head, maybe... More just the bald spot...
Wow that has to be some of your best work. Great job buddy

Hello, low-opacity ham.
Is it me or does bryson sound older?
Can we just admire the fact that bryson is the only animator that uses memes
I posted this comment already but I accidentally deleted it so at 2:41 the same thing happened to me but with a metal hoop at a playground I hopped I joy of victory and *bonk* at first I didn't feel anything but then I touched it and.... THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD THERE WAS A HOLE IN MY HEAD! While on our way to the hospital i asked from my dad "am i dying" at the hospital o just needed to get three stitches and bandages on my head for a little bit. One day my dad remembered  that accident and said "remember that time when you hit your head on the basketball hoop? And when we were going to the hospital you said are you dying" When i remembered that too i died of laughter
I have broken three bones...
This got recommended                               👌
one time I climbed a bookshelf and it fell on me. If I had my head out a tiny bit more I would have died. But all I got was a bruise the size of my back. I could not lay on my back for like a month.  And one time I hit my brother in the head with a hammer.
4:30 I'm a tire
Show your face again
Bryson:(fall from a mountain) im okay  Me:(fall from a mountain) rip
Why are we still here just to suffer, I can feel every inch of my bones, the comrades I lost, its like there 😔 😭 still there, it won't stop hurting, you feel it to right bryson????

For some reason this reminds me of Ice Cream Sandwich, but with colour.
well im here before half a day, big surprise
Meanwhile me as a 5 year old cuts myself open with a ton of broken glass eh this is fine
I remember when I did a backflip and I messed up and my feet hit my head AND I was playing tag with my brother and I went on the bunk bed and the fan cut the exact spot where ur head got cut
I have a scar on my eyebrow too
so this is how smash bros is in game
The title of this video describes how im feeling
I just notice that how bryson animates his sky is like steven universe sky
What is this thumbnail and starting to this vid
everytime i see someone get hurt I feel the pain Me at the end of this video: kill me and end my suffering of pain
Funny bones aren’t really that painful they just tingle and it’s annoying
Hyper edit alert

Funny bones are actually veins
Kid: But Bryson i have not broken  a bone yet  Bryson: well we can fix that!  Me thinking he is gonna give something to break his bones  1 second later  ok guess not
All girls are the same
Bro that's nothing I cut my eye lid open and I was able to see with my eye closed

Can you make a video of your experience of video games and your favourite game :)
Lemme guess the worst one by far was the funny bone  Everybody who has had pain before: I AGREE
Bryson: Animates himself dying in detail at the start of all his videos Bryson two seconds later: So, mortality!
I lAuGhEd a LoT
My mom: owww my back. me: yes I have the same pain but with cuts but when it touches soap it’s  like this. Ahhhh my hand
2:41 *b o n k*

Hey Bryson how many times did you die PLUS how many clones you have :v
1:19  “See that? Your back isn’t supposed to do that.”   I’ll tell you, I’ve bent so far I could touch my nose. And they call this an “exercise”
Yeeeeeee3eeeeèy
I love the bloody parts of the animation
OUCH!
*Pain.*
ow
Getting my fingers slammed into doors hurts a LOT more than breaking thumbs. So some of your painful experiences are probably more painful than breaks.
0:11 to start your day

Man, you lucky you only got THOSE injuries. Although I have never broken a bone, I hit my head, elbow, knee and stub my toe atleast once every 2 days. Occasionaly, Ill hit my funny bone. But otherwise, pain is my ruler.
wow what a smart child 2:05
I've never broken a bone too bryson
I also have a scar on my brow (not relly,it just left a bald spot thing)
I was gonna say I was waiting for so long then I checked your videos then I saw that I was  waiting for just 4 weeks 😲
It's funny that I was listening to the Unforgiven trilogy before watching this video
1:35 oh god
also on skillshare it says 14 free days,that's not enough time for my tiny brain to progress anything XD my tiny 31 year old brain is like duuuuuuuh  when I want to learn animation,it would take me way more than 14 days XD but I still want to try though so why not?! maybe my tiny brain will let me learn something for once
ahhh  pain
One time during skiing a snowboarder was coming at me around the bend and he decided to use me as a jump so he jumped the tip of my skis fractured my skull ease
I fell a few years ago when I was walking,face first,I chipped my tooth,and my other tooth right next to the chipped one,was slowly started to turn gray,also had a scrapped arm and knee,,so we decided to fix both of my teeth,I got my chipped tooth fixed first,then like a week later (I think) I had to get a root canal for the tooth that was slowly dying,when the numbness of the medicine worn off from the root canal,that tooth throbbed like hell that I flinched every time it throbbed,very painful,and it took me a year to get over my fear of going out for walks again
Yes sure force x velocity = pain
Btw that thumbnail is super cursed
is it me or has Bryson still not gone through puberty?
"STOP TOUCHING ME, STOP TOUCHING ME DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH???? STOP TOUCHING ME"  Me:  *yes we all speak english*

I once was in line at school messing around and running in the back, then my friend gabe thinks it a good idea to trip me while I’m running. It works, I fall, he laughs, intel... There was a water fountain infront of me and when I fell, my knee slammed into it, causing some parts of my knee to shatter.
These sound effects made me weak 😂

Similar thing Happened to me with the door. When i was little (around 4), basically we were playing with the door and i decided that i should put my hand between the door hinges, since i was little i could fit my hand and because it was so tiny, anyway my brother 3 at the time somehow slammed the the door at high speeds and crushed my hand.
LMAO-
Everytime I go up the stairs I imagine falling down them from the top and it SUCKS.
hurt.
" I also died (3 times)" "Pain"   *Somethings wrong I can feel it*

Pain.
I'm getting a drawing tablet on Monday in the mail and I'm going to be just like youyou're my favorite YouTuber and I appreciate your content even though the pandemic is a struggle I hope you do good and don't get sick
Bit of a storytime.  So it was around 8:00, I was 7 or 8, and I was seeing Cartoon Network shut off so that meant it was time to go get my dad, I got dressed, walked down the steps with my mom,  *when it happened.*  I accidentally skipped a step and fell onto the rocks, and I twisted my ankle, I still went with my mom to get my dad, *cool moment* after we got my dad, we went to the hospital, then I had to take a break off school because of it. I had homeschool for a week or three, then I came back to school, I still had to go to the foot doctor for appointments. Now I laugh back at this,  *but a year later I fall off a step again and scrape my leg at rite aid*
Bryson is so funny
When your little brother eats your food 1:36
I am 12 and I hope I never brake a bone P.S. love you vids
The thumbnail is reminding me of Deku
Your voice is deeper Why
I’ve never broken a bone but I sure have broken open my chin
I agree with Bryson  about removing your funny bone because it sucks and its not even funny to hit your funny bone
“My pain is greater than yours!”

Wait... If the ham leaves you if you're being bad, then why does Bryson's still stay with him even though he kills someone in basically every video, and in others, he badly injures someone?

Oml early yey
Once I got a nail through my foot
One time when I was nine I was at my friend's house and they have a slide. So I went on the slide and immediately my friend got on the millisecond im not on the very top (this is important later). But I had too much speed and i went flying of the top and my friend was on my back. Then I put one of my arms out in front and the elbow was going directly vertically in to my gut (you can probably see where this is going). So I landed really hard on the ground with my friend on my back and my fist hit the ground first propelling my elbow in to my gut. Then I came down with my friend on my back slamming down on the elbow. It hurt.
two words: Period cramps   Those suck :(
Me when I wake up for school 4:30
Boi I cracked my head open last year and got staples            Staples barely hurt. I wasn't on any not hurt juice.

Ham
My worst injury was when I stubbed my toe into the floor
Love how I’m watching this whilst my wrist is in pain
Did you know the funny bone was a nerve.
can u wish me happy birthday pls
😨😨😨😨oh my
The most pain i have in life by falling downs the stairs and my leg hurt wont walk but im fine now
It was in Manhattan. Little 5 or 6 years old me was playing on the swings in the park. I thought it would be SUPER DANK if I jumped off the swing, and land perfectly. And so I did exactly that. Expect I didn't. I jumped off the swing, and landed my eye, right on the spiked fence. Immediate Black Out. I wake up in a hospital bed, with Toy Story 2 or 3 on the TV, and a Flat Stanley Book right next to me. The doctor came in with my parents and said they did stitches on my upper eye, and said that if I didn't get to a hospital in time, I would have lost my eye. Now I have a permanent scar on my upper right eye, right above my eyelid.                           AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

0:15  HEADSHOT
One time I sprained my ankle by tripping on a pillow. :/
Why does you intro look like “BYSONS evolving !”
I stubbed my toe while watching this...
I heard you had a lot of pain and got stitches, but I am the ultimate one!, so I’ll tell you how it happened, so I was siting on my couch on the corner of it where there was this table and I was near the corner of the table and I was playing or something but I fell off the couch and slammed onto the table and I was “AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH” I was only two in a half and when me mom heard me she took me to the hospital and the doctors and my dad had to hold me down while I was crying in pain and because I was scared, not because I was bleeding but because there was a very big needle they had to use and I got three LAYERS of stitches in me head, So I had more pain than Bryson.
4:08 boxing bag evaded the attack
Oh thumbna

He Sounds Older
Don't even get me started on the pain of my migraines...
OH MY GOD THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN BRYSON SINCE 2017 OR SOMETHING
A bird once got into the house at, like, 5am, and our cats had it cornered in there living room. And went down to see what the nose was and found it on a throw pillow, unharmed. I thought it was suck in the fabric, and I didn't wanna touch it for fear of pecking. So I picked up the pillow and brought it upstairs to my parents. They said to just take it outside and let it fly away. On my way back downstairs, I was hyperfocused on the bird. It suddenly flew up into my face, causing me to try and fall several steps, on my ass, down the stairs. I was pretty sore for the next few days.
he never aged out of middle school yet i still enjoy his content
Im the god of pain   *Does parkour*
*The perfectly cut screams are amazing*
One time I slapped my mom and she punched me  Me:  want to get Covid
I once ran in to the outward corner of a wall and almost busted my head open I now have a small dent you can’t see or feel but now that I am older I am dumber than ever
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

You ,Brodyanimations and infamous swoosh should call yourselfs the left haired clan
Bryson kills someone,  Explosion noises
One time i was running down the sidewalk and i fell, i really badly scraped my knee and it bleed everywhere,
Ya one time I got my hand stuck in a excelator in a mall
I love the physical humor in this.
Uhh...Does it count if I broke someone else’s bone?
I had to deal with the door thing but I didn't go to hospital and it wasnt long ago
Bought your youtooz and a ham plushie
well the interest playing I paused it so I can go because someone called me and then I came back I saw a bunch of scribbles and garbage everywhere it was hilarious you should’ve seen my face I will be like: 😂😂👁👅👁😂😂 (edit) The screen that said “ for example” i see a little ham lolz
But I have a smooth brain 🧠 not a big brain 🧠
what makes the funny feeling in the funny bone is a vein
One time me and my brother were wrestling for fun and my knees were on the ground when I was on his back and then to get me off he flopped back to where I was on my knees back flat on the ground with around 200 pounds on me and it felt like I just broke my knees
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof

0:40 *among us neck snap sounds*
Pain
3:21 I did something like that when I was around 7 or 8. Me and my cousin were downstairs with my aunt who was looking for something in another room. She kept the door open and I thought it was a good idea to place my fingers in the space  where the door and wall connects and hang off of it to make my cousin laugh. When my aunt came out she shut the door on my fingers and I screamed bloody murder. One of my  finger nails was all messed and had to be removed.
2:41 I laughed so hard I fell down the stairs
I littarly everyday when I get out of my room I stub my bothe Pinkie toward there out of my nails littarly and my bigger toe littarly fell of and looks like jagged teeth ....  Yea just a scratch.
People break bones normally     Me: breaks my collarbone from rolling off my couch

Also I went to kiss my cat on the forehead when I was five and then I tripped and hit my head and I had a hoodie on so when my mom saw all she saw a scraped chin but when I went to touch where it hurt and my entire hand was covered in blood. So now I have a scar on my eyebrow.

Litterally just yesterday,  I was giving my dog water and I leaned over to put the jug of water we usually keep her water in to pour it in her bowl. My dogs head was just below my forehead, for some reason my dog litterally JOLTED her head up and i was convinced it was the end of times, after about 30s of pain, it kinda stopped and i looked in the mirror to make sure I wasn't bleeding or had a bruise and  luckily I just has a light red kinda spot on my head. Now it hurts when I raise my eyebrows yay
So funny
I laughed way to much at this

I have broken 5 bones, but it only hurts for a couple days. Then you can flex on people about how you endured the pain for the rest of your life.
I got a scar across my eybrow because i was stupid i was 7 years old and i was spinning and fell on a glass tv stand and then it cut down to the skull butt suprisingly i didnt cry
When I got my first tattoo (which was a Japanese dragon sleeve) I sat there for 4 hours and I felt alot of pain but Idk why but I kinda liked i like pain by the way it's just a weird thing about me anyway it hurt like hell and felt like a thousand dragons scratching my arm there sharp needle like claws digging into my skin as they leave red blood behind causing it to look like red paint my 4 year old imagination just kicked in

I never broke a bone when I fell down the stairs multiple
speaking of pain i somehow cut myself with cardboard
Im so glad im not the only one who stuck my head in a running ceiling fan..... But mine was on accidental purpose?
I broke my arm 10 mins after talking about me never breaking a bone
Bro i have that exact scar but for different reasons
I've had worse pain.      Story 1:  as a kid there was this rectangle wood thingy (idk what its called) and I broke a toenail with it. I remember that it bled. blood was everywhere. it was painful. (I think I broke the big toe toenail on my right foot) but luckily, it grew back.  Story 2: one fateful summer day, there was this grill you put on a table or something like that, and my arm happened to just touch it. it hurt, cause I burned myself. a BIG scab grew where i burned myself. but one night my sister tried to get me to leave her room (cause she had a friend over) and hit the scab and peeled it back (I can see that people are probably cringing rn) and it hurt. if you were to touch where it was peeled back (where it was red) it stung. my parents gave me a nonstick adhesive pad and sprayed something (I forgot what it was called) on where it stung and then placed the adhesive nonstick pad on it. it stopped the stinging and I had to take a bath one day. I was scared that it would sting again, but luckily, it didn't. we got rid of the rest of the scab and it healed over time. (the end lol cause that's all I remember for story 2)
Real pain is working on a digital art piece or animation for weeks and having it peace out of existence one unfortunate day just as it was almost finished. :(
Yup
After watching the vid me: uhhahhughghh disgusting
I love your vids
“ I decided to jump off the bed but I didn’t realise that the ceiling fan was at full speed”  Me: oh yeah, it’s all coming together
That happened to my funny bone to except for way worse

YOUR VOICE IS DEEPER
I had a broken bone. It was my right femur bone. It's healed now, but occasionally, despite not being my broken right leg, my left leg tingles when it rains. It used to be my right leg, though.
I broke my big toe it hurt a lot. So I was siting down putting on my sock and then I was siting behind a chair bc..... bc :P then the Chair fell on my toe and broke the nail and smashed my bone inside my toe and I screemed a lot and this was happening when I was going to school I skipped school for 5 days I think 👍 then I went to the doctors and I was fine only in pain :) and lots of blood. Ok bye
The beginning of this made my face go so far into my head it looked like I had diarrhoea and was shiting so hard it looked like I had 3 but cheeks with 2 but holes and it burned so hard I was in the deepest pit of hell

C o o k i e
Stubbing your toe is worse than falling off a cliff
I also had a similar experience.  One time I was at a community center with my friend and we went to this dance party.   I was closing my eyes because my friend wanted to blindfold me and then there was this other kid.  He went to my school he is in a higher grade and he didn't like that me and my friend annoyed him. But anyway as he was trying to hide in the smelly boys bathroom that my friend wanted me to go into blinded, I got my ring finger stuck into the door while he was closing it, and my fingers were in pain. It was bleeding from the nails and it was a disaster. The boy later the next day apologized to me. I forgave him. I haven't heard much from him. Very very later, I was and still am no longer with my friend. And Ive been struggling to make and/or keep friends ever since.
U should start an Animator SMP with Brody, Swoosh, Junky, James, Jaiden, Luke, Adam, etc.

One time, at school, I was having a school project, so I dint remember why, I brought a skate board, and I was showing some thing with it, like momentum of objects or some thing I can’t actually skate, and then I sat on it, and slid across the room for a “haha! Look at me im so cool” moment........  I fell of the skate board. So then i thought i was fine, until i felt woozy and almost passed out, and i went to a hospital, and figured out, 🎉 I fractured my arm! 🎉  So yeah. That happened

Any one see the drake meme? 🤔
the worst pain i felt is when i took a backflip off a swing cause I was stupid and wasn't hanging on my eye almost got stabbed out cause  a root was hanging out 1 cen away from my eye
One time I was riding a fake bull thing and it for some reason randomly sped up and I got launched and since it was a janky thing I went flying into the grass and cement I was 7 at the time so it was easy to get flung
when I was 8 or somethin like 2 classes were running with a tug of war rope and the person in front of me stopped so I stopped but the person behind me kept going and the rope slid under my feet and a fell and I broke my hand clean. I still actually get pains in it from time to time. Breaking a bone H U R T S .

I also hit my funny bone
I remember when I was in like 2nd grade I decided to lean forward on this bar by this ramp you take to go to the playground and I first swing in between the bars smashing my hard on a concrete wall which bounce my head off to hit the iron bar and then the concrete again, but that’s not all because I landed in the splits in a small space the was already hard enough to get out of and yet I’ve never broken a bone so try to compete with that Bryson

When your fingers got stuck something simmaler to my brother on Christmas Eve
Plot twist: The Bryson that produced,directed and writed this is an exact replica of the real Bryson. Her mother (and the doctor with her) thought that Bryson died because of the "sleep juice" and created a clone with his memories and she never told "Bryson". Although,...The real Bryson is still out there.
A NEW VID YES

You deserve it little to be rude to every YouTube channel’s
you know whats funny at the time of this being released i was getting stiches
Just from watching this video I got some really funny memories back. Once my brother and I ( also my dad ) were tackling each other on a bed. Someone always get hurt from this.... But not like this one. So my dad was on all fours at the end of the bed going across, and my brother had the bright idea to run at full speeds to tackle him off the bed onto the laundry. My dad, knowing he wold do that got in a postion to laydown when he ran at full speeds. Oh i should remind you , my brother is really fast so he going sonic. Now our Tv set was, large drawer with spiky handes , annnnnnnnnnnndddddd with a Tv on that. It was just far enouh away that cos of the speed my brother was going to tackle my dad  , and my dad laying down as soon as he's about to be tackled,... this ain't gonna wok out well. in the end my brother practically launched himself off the bed, just scraping the plastic broken laundry basket , and slamming his head and funny bones right onto.. You guessed it! the the large drawer with spiky handles !! It all happed so quick  it was hilarious. Of corse not for my brother though, he spent the night in hospital.
It’s fenneh                         0:00 - 0:43

With the last story the same thing happened to me. Except it was a chair..
Bryson: “This door hinge looks pretty cool. I should put my fingers in there!”  Me: *Instant PTSD from elementary school...*  That brings back so many painful memories... BUT, I never broke my fingers!😂
I have felt pain...... On my 9th birthday I went to a trampoline park with my friends. Everybody was having fun until, one of friends was hit in the face with a dodge ball (she ended up being ok) then I got hit with one. It didn't hurt that much. BUT SOMETHING EVEN WORSE HAPPENED. I was jumping on to this one trampoline when a kid jumped on the trampoline at the same time as me SPRAINING MY ANKLE. My mom took care me as I limped my to the car. We arrived at the pizza place ate and left.               *That was the worst birthday I ever had*
I have a scar on my head I have proof two

3:54 why your brother got the Giornos hair in brown
How did you make your video that fast
Ok everything bad about pain is bad, but if you did not feel pain then you are in high risk to die because if you don’t feel pain then you would be in constant danger cuz when you did feel pain you would have thought: no I shall not do this I will feel pain and pain hurts so I can not do that  So take a moment to appreciate how you thought of that and not end up dead
0:15 nice smash sound effect
i once road i bike down some stairs and hit my head on some pipe  i am infertile from that edit:why did i say that
i physically cringed so hard at the part right before you got your fingers slammed because i knew what was coming. it hurts so fricking much.

Bryson if you didn’t have bones you would die because 1. You would lose your skull which means brain isn’t protected 2. You would lose your ribs  which means your heart and other organs wouldn’t be protected 3.you wouldn’t have a spine so you would permanently paralyzed 4. All those together means you would die.

That intro was was gory
I have a pain story: one time in P.E. we wear playing a game like rounders but you had to kick the ball. We were also playing on the tennis courts and the floor was concrete. So i was running to a base and I fell keep in mind I was wearing P.E. clothes aka a t-shirt and shorts so safe to say I got scratched up. I somehow injured my left hand and arm a bit on the left side of my body and worst of all both of my knee caps. Take a moment to cringe... ok times up. Anyway I got pached up and 2 funny thing 1 is i have anxiety about wearing shorts while standing on concrete you could guess why and second we didn’t play that game on the corts again that year we played it in the hall instead. Yes this was long I am sorry
Hey would you look at that im éàrlŷ

Dude I thought I was the only one that jumped off the bunk beds as a kid and hit my head on the ceiling fan
I can see this channel, growing very big and very popular. Keep up the good work
My brother once shut the front door on my hand, and since it was the front door it took 1 minute of screaming to alert him that i needed help. That may not seem very long, but when you have a 90 lbp, 2 inch thick door crushing the very bones that make up your fingers, it hurts.
Next episode: lets count how many war crimes i can break in 30 seconds
Hamimation: I went through AO MUCH PAAAIN     deku with his whole body broke : you gotta be kidding

One time I was hanging with my friends by a lake and it had a place for boats to be anchored and it had a brick ledge to prevent people from slipping into the lake. We where there at that time so I put my back against the ledge and we where playing around, I decided to do a backflip off the brick ledge and not a FRONTflip so after I did it I landed successfully but I accidentally slipped from my sneakers and then I fell on some very sharp stone, My right arm being cut from me also falling on one of the hooks to anchor the boats and then falling in the lake. I got sent to the hospital and never went back again.
The thumbnail is me When I stub my toe

Yay another haminations A video it’s been a while and I’m impatient I am so happy you posted again
Hello
One time I fell off the front porch and cut my head open. Another time I was playing on our patio. We had a 7ft y’all rock wall that I was climbing on (in crocs I might add) when I was like 6 and one of the crocs got stuck on the rock so I face planted into our flagstone patio. I basically sliced part of my lip off so it looked like I had some missing. I got 13 stiches (yes 13) and there end of story, right? Wrong. The fall had killed the roots of one of my teeth and a couple weeks later the tooth turned grey basically so we had to get it pulled. Aaaaand the anesthetic didn’t work on me so I had to get a tooth yanked out with toothpicks and felt every minute of it....it took about 3 years for the adult tooth to finish coming in and now I have a literal SCAR on my TOOTH.
I did the blood thing but on the trampoline instead and super glued it shut 😦 and the same thing as the door one
Sup
Bryson: I got hurt. Me:(btw these actually happened to me)I had tubes in my ears, an infection on my wrist that feels like I die every second, bell’s pulse TWICE, also having a retainer and expander. TRIST ME AND EXPANDER AND RETAINER HURT SO BAD BECAUSE THEY FRIGGIN EXPAND YOUR SKULL
Bryson,stop using stock sound affects, its infuriatingly anoying so just stop
Dude the fan thing happened to me too
First time?
pain helps ur body lol
my 2 worst stories of pain:  1: so it was my older brothers birthday and we were all out side playing tag (cuz thats what little children do) and there was a little and i mean little hole i the ground (it was like a dent in the ground) and when i was running away from my brother some how my foot went into the whole and twisted and i broke 3 bones in my foot (maybe even 4 bones).  2: again we were playing tag outside and we had a little flower garden in our front yard and we didnt really go in there cuz we had roses and we didnt want to step on thorns but i went in there running away from my brother (and the flower garden was by my porch) and then i was running away from my brother i triped and fell head first into the porch and busted mt head open (oh and i was like 5 so i was in a lot of pain for a 5 year old) we had to go to the doctor but luckly i didnt get stiches but a had a huge pach were i busted my head open at so it didnt bleed and i also had to go to my brothers bace ball games with it on and i hated it.
I have a question

Roblox bone breaker simulator be like:  The first clip
Bryson died from falling from a high place.
Hye Bryson! Breaking a bone doesn’t hurt that much, it just feels like your cells are being blocked.. but if you touch it, just..... don’t.  NeVeR ToUcH YoUr BrOkEn BoNe!! The only times it hurts is when  1. Touch your bone for some stupid reason 2.moving you hand (or leg, it depends on what bone you broke) 3.When you take an X-ray, the docs have to move it wildly for some reason 4.when fixing the bone 5. Process of putting you in a cast 6. Not being able to scratch your hands when it’s VERY itchy 7.after getting out of a cast, (if it wasn’t a fracture and it actually broke, then 6-8 weeks of itchiness) it hurts a lot when you try to move it  So it doesn’t hurt huh, idk, Maybe it’s because I’m from a country where pain is nothing and that we feel physical and mental pain, idk but when I broke my bone in a painful way 4 times, I didn’t cry. But I saw some kids crying like their mama is dead or something, they probably cried until their tired and ran out of tears :)
This isn't the video I wanted, it's the video I needed     (I've had and am still having a stomach-ache that lasted for a whole week)
I still do jump off my top bunk it is fan I never had any accidents true but I’m only 8 so yeah....

So, i went as fast as I could stood up and, u can probally guess what happened next, I jumped off and I landed so close to the merry go round (wasn’t so merry) one of the bikes hit me and I bled so much that I almost passed out. I got a scar on my eyebrow too now :D.
I am clumsy and I keep hitting my shelf by tripping, running into stuff, getting tackled and not being seen
Lol I ran into a wall and I also have a scar across my eye
Hello
Why was it called chunin exams this is not naruto
Bryson has atleast gone to the hospital a 100 times in his whole life
I mean I got a small wooden clock dropped on my head when I was little. I was fine tho. I also fractured my ankle after apparently kicking a wall. And also fractured my uhm collar bone?? Idk but I fractured something there after jumping off the couch with fairy wings thinking I could fly. I think that’s how that one happened. Idk what else but my parents started getting worried that the doctors would thing they were abusing me because I went to the hospital like three times in like one of two months or something. Idk but the thought of me doing dumb stuff is funny
That intro tho
In a dream igot a nosebleed from my brother then my dad yelled at me for crying
Funny how this came out the day after I almost broke my foot with pot
Great video  From mom
I love your videos so much! Keep up the work

Hey guys
Pain is eternal
Bruh imagine not having your heart taken out of your body
I’m still waiting for Bryson’s voice to change. We’re probably gonna be waiting a while..
This video is rated R for violence
Getting injured hurts
This is my favourite video
OH DAMN DOH that first part
OK bryson srry but the reason it's called a funny bone is because there is no bone in that area which causes the feeling of an electrical shock and something else (My mom used to be a nurse)
U and me both
That's not bad I had worse and I'm actually serious
Oh my gosh it took forever for another video
white figure: *says anything* bryson: *so you have chosen death*

This video made me laugh so hard!
I vote to remove the funny bone to
Yo you are so cool : )
Yeah I went through bad physical pain!          *Never broke a bone*
I remember once my Dad slammed his truck door FULL “I WORK MANUAL LABOR AND DO CONSTANT HEAVY LIFTING” FORCE ONTO MY TINY BABY FINGERS. But it was my fault because I was climbing on his truck and didn’t notice (don’t ask why, I was the weirdo who would literally climb on top of her dad’s truck and scooch down the windshield like it was a dry slip and slide.)
This definitely describes my pain
This video was P A I N F U L
O o f
Bryson would make a good pan cake 😈
The defenition of pain:when you fall in a platformer game

Here are some stories.  Story time 1: i was running under metal stairs as i was crouching. Then i jumped up to quick and slammed, my  head on the metal stairs. I then a group of girls picked me up as everything was red cuz blood got in my eyes. Then my parents took me to the ER.  Story time 2: i put my fingers behind the door and my brother closed the door and i lost a finger nail.   T-t-t-that's all folks!

When I was 5 on my birthday, I decided to help my family by pushing medal chairs around,  the way I was pushing it was, I would push forward, eventually the chair caught a ridge in the floor and got stuck and I fell on the chair therefore catching my fingers in the chair, after the birthday party we went to the hospital and they said I broken my ring finger and my thumb (the pain was TERRIBLE)
Wow he added blood

Your funny bone is actually an unprotected nerve cluster so its literally the abscence of a bone
swaggers another animation
Me: *Watches* Video: 2:40 Bryson: *Gets Sqished* Me: *SQEEKY LAUGH*
For example my pain: 1.sprained my ankle 2.i was going down a big steep hill when I realized there is a man a boy and a big fluffy doggo and I took the option to miss them but in the process get my leg grinded I to the asphalt 3.i fell down METAL STAIRS 4. Fell down wooden stairs and made my jump bad 5. I fell and somehow a rock just drilled really deep into me and it might still be in me cuz I didn't go to the hospital and I did not tell my mom that a rock drilled into me

Bryson falling down a mountain is the new Brody falling down the stairs.
Bryson is like sr pelo and odd1sout combined.
One time my bike wasn’t very stable cause I had a flat tire so I fell on the handle bars so I couldn’t breath and I broke the brakes so yeah that hurt and I almost died
I was waiting for him to ‘clap’ someone with his ‘cheeks’ again.
Is your style inspired by jaidenanimation?
i was snowboarding down a hill once and going fast as i could and then my board got caught on some ice and according to the friend i was with i span around a total of 7 times in the air and fell on my neck and all my gear went flying :/ also that one time i fell 80 feet and for some reason walked away without a scratch
Ok
I broke both of my arms because I fell down my 10 feet stairs,I also got a big goose bump and I broke my knee
bro this is so hillariouse
Finally a new video
i bit my tougne while watching this video
I LOVE YOUR VIDS SO MUCH
1:57 is it weird that I did the same thing as little Bryson
The title should be: "Pain." YOU FORGOT THE PERIODygqwfhhyjfuoiugn*yoj)(uwq(f*yinrxexhLHhnuxewinheinhcqcku
for some reason i want to break my bones
That same exact thing happened to me with the fan when I was throwing a pillow over the edge.
Bryson is getting GOOD at editing an animation s
I have a scar on eyebrow
E
Your videos helped me cope with 27\36 test score
3:30 that happened to me 2 times
I have a pain story too. It was my moms 32nd Birthday. It was at our house. Everyone had left, except my grandparents. My dad was 34. My older sister was 4. My little brother was a month old.  I was 2. For context, I was very clumsy and never walked by myself until I was 2 or 3. If I didn’t hold someone’s hand, I would fall. Now, I don’t know what I thought that day, but I decided to climb the stairs by myself, I thought I was so fancy. The adults were all talking, so they didn’t have their eyes on me. And you know the rule, you take your eyes off your children  for one second, the worst could happen. So as I was climbing, something happened... I slipped. And fell UP the stairs on my chin. Not down the stairs, UP! Needless to say I got a pretty deep cut and screamed my head off like Bryson did in the video. We had to spend the rest of the party in the emergency room with me getting stitches on my chin. However, I didn’t want to cooperate, so I had to be held down and a straight jacket because I wouldn’t stop kicking and screaming. I don’t remember if I was given the anesthesia, but yeah. That was a nice way to end my mother’s 32nd birthday. I hope Bryson can see this.
It just hurt myself
Ha you felt only physical pain ive had mentall pain
aight here's my story  so i went to the park w my friend and she brought her cousins and their friend showed up and through a rock at my mouth and i lost 2 permanent teeth, broke my maxilla, chipped another tooth, and broke another tooth in half that got taken out so im missing 3 teeth and i have 4 scars- 1 on the right side of my lip, one in the dippy thingy under your nose, and 2 inside my mouth ya y this was in octobEr
Bryson: Your back isn't supposed to do that Contortionist's: ._.
Ah yes i remember when a bruzed my arm and it felt like it broke good times... Good times...
Lol
“Your bones aren’t supposed to do that.”   Ferrets: “I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.”  ( if you don’t get the joke, ferrets have bendy bones.)
Finally                      U MADE ANOTHER VID
I am brisns
I jumped over bunk beds and I regret it the pain the pain
Hey the title describes my life! :)
once I hit my funny bone so hard it felt like a match was on my arm to my arm. Also once when MY mom called me I jumped off the top of the bunk and sprained both of my hands.
This one time when I was a toddler I think but  I got my fingers slammed in the fridge
0:12 he broke 100000000900000 bones and scream
Finally am not alone
You know getting injured, sure it hurts, but like, dope scar.

Y’all had that moment where your foot “rolled”      It broken mine.

4:34 GASP! U TOO?!
P A I N...
I once fell off of a tree on solid concrete when I was about 8. I landed on my butt and surprisingly didn't break anything. But the next morning I was so sore that even rolling over in bed caused me immense pain. My sister and I ended up watching tv on our Mom's iPad while I lied down in bed until I could move more comfortably.
People when they are early: gotta think of something funny

One day I was thinking "Wow I'll never break a bone!" That day someone knocked into me and I FRACTURED my bone. Jokes on you world haven't broke a bone!
When I broke my first bone (collar bone) I didn’t feel anything it was numb

Maybe Annie could teach you even more animation? Idk, she's an awesome animator (tress?), and no offense,  the parts she animates are easily distuinguishable from yours. I'm just thinking out loud (wait but this is a text message...?) here.

Once I was in class and they had this activity wear you would have to spell words with beans ( it was really weird ) and one day when I was in that activity alone and I thought what would happen if I put a bean in my ear and then I did it and I had to go to the hospital and 7 nurses had to hold me down and take the beans out of my ear. (Btw this happened in 2 grade).

Once I was sitting on the top of a bunk bed, and my mom called me. Instead of stepping on the ladder, I somehow missed and fell to my doom. Luckily, I was fine. Just landed on my back and got winded. Good times...

Funny story: I went skiing and I accidentally went down the red slope (or as we call it"blood slope") and that slope had a very big drop. But I was actually going to the blue slope.  (which we call "the blue bird") so I apparently didn't brake/do the pizza and faceplanted on the slope and I didn't know what was going on, and after I didn't have a single broken bone.  BUT. That night. I was jumping on the bed at the hut we were staying in. I missed the bed and landed on the floor. And guess what. I BROKE MY LEG! I LITERALLY JUMPED ON A FRICKING BED! AND I BROKE A BONE. NO NOT ON THE DANGEROUS SLOPE. BUT A BED!  So the moral of this story is:  If you go skiing. Don't be scared of the hill or mountain. BE SCARED OF YOUR BED.
The door one made me feel the pain..Oof
Okie my turn.   First Story: I was riding my bike around the block. The turn at the bottom of a street was made in a way so that the way I was riding (down), before the turn, you’re moving downhill. Halfway through the turn, you went uphill until you hit a culdesac [Pronounced: cul-de-sack]. I had reached the turn and I was on a mountain bike (I knew how to ride without training wheels, I was 10). So, when I reached this turn, I started turning right, and I don’t exactly know what happened, but I suddenly fell on my left uncontrollably. Say you were pointing your elbow forward and your hand was on your shoulder. The round, bloody scar was an inch before the curve of the elbow. It hurt.   Second Story: [Coming Soon]

Actually funny story I hated strip throat tests and I struggled so much my parent’s couldn’t hold me down (and I was really young) so they had to put a straight jacket on me
Merry Christmas Bryson
I don't remember I don't remember this all that well but when I was little I was just Learning how to walk and I fell down a concrete step and bashed my head into to ground so now I have a scar on my forehead but also another time when I was little I was running around a building that was being built and yk those rust bars well my grand parents told me "Tobi stop running around like that you'll get hurt" but my 4 y\o mind said "no grandma I will not stop to listen to your wise advice and instead I will continue to be a nuisance because I want to" ling story short I ended up tripping on a rust bar and bow I also have a scar on my knee and thigh.  Another time was at a beach me and my friends were messing around yk being kids and I was 6 I didn't quite know how to swim yet and I got pushed under the water by my friend Johnny and I panicked and I scratched my foot on a sharp rock
Holy God that thumbnail
Bro I have a scar from stitches on my eyebrow too, BROW BROS
Story: Once when I was 6 I think, I was riding my neighbour's scooter up and down the sidewalk. I had already gone up and down so I was prepared for my impending doom. Right when my neighbour's nanny looked away the front wheel of the scooter ran over a pebble and the pebble got stuck, causing me with my full momentum to catapult into the ground face first at full speed. My forehead slammed into the ground so hard swear there was an audible thump. Being me I immediately got up returned the scooter and managed to make my way back to my house without falling over. I waddled upstairs and collapsed onto my bed and cried into my pillow. For the next 2 days I had a splitting headache.  Thus is the story of why I hate going faster than a walking pace on a scooter.

Fun fact: we all thought he would never upload again:not a fact
Hmm....pain.
Cool I have a cool scar across my aye brow.
Fun fact:your "funny bone"isn't a bone,its actually a nerve
Well i ran into a pole in 5th grade
I have become way too careful after the age of 9, I think because we did some kind of "Minecraft parkour" thing, where we would jumped from the edge of some platform down to the bicycle rack (sorry if that isn't the right term for that), but I had the great idea that I should go all the way to the wall and jump... I got a big scratch on my leg because I lost my balance and it was there for 4 months :| it's still here today and I sometimes still feel the pain for some reason.
I’m the same as you I littery had so many times were I thought I broke my bone but I NEVER HAVE BROKEN A BONE. And also I was on a sled and the sled was so crappy that I flipped over and backflipped and almost broke my back but I never did

I loved this video keep up the good work
The most pain I remember feeling was when I slid and fell down the stairs and hit my tailbone on each step. In other words, the most pain I’ve felt wasn’t when I broke a bone, but when I bruised one.

HOW OLD ARE U
I want to remove pain because it causes pain.
Never been this early
To be fair, "pain" does rhyme with "cow"
Haha u think having a tiny scar on your eyebrow is bad, how 'bout cutting on the edge of the table making deeeeep and having to Stitch it together and being careful for like a week or 2 and having your own kabab stolen. HMM. *NOT TRYING TO ONE UP U OR ANYTHING* (actually I am for some reason idk why) overall great vid

Have you ever smashed your finger in a car door and even worse not realizing your finger is in the door while closeing it really hard thats true pain it was so bad i had to get my finger nail burned off so the blood come out and this i time wen i was 3 or 4 i put my fingers in the trunk door and my mom closed it and i cant remember gow much pain that was but i think it was really bad and im suprised i haven't broken my fingers my now
Hey that’s my latest video name
Bryson: I've Never broken a bone!  Me *i've fractured my ankle and shin while breaking my hand and fingers. maybe im not as accident proof as i thought. I wonder how much football helmets cost.
Pain feels good...                              In a way.
Did Bryson acctualy make a discord server?
Yes pain hurts
My pain was getting scissors between the eyes and almost going blind if I moved a inch
The funny bone is actually the ulnar nerve, good luck removing it and still     having your hand work right. LOL😎
a nail went into my foot
you gave up the opportunity to name it "hurt"
You just described my existence

During a tragic accident as young teen, Bryson lost his ears...

Only pain that I got as a kid was shutting the car door on my fingers, noic

Bryson: I’ve never broken a bone, but I’ve gotten many injuries Me: *Vietnam war flashbacks* I broke my wrist at the age of 5, I sprain my right ankle every year at the same time of year, I’ve hit my head and arms on my bed frame so many times. The worst injury that I got? Well..       My Mum doesn’t support me for being LBGTQ+ 😬
Bryson: *gets hurt ALOT* Bryson: *goes to hospital* Docters: Hey Bryson! welcome back!
*I agree that funny bones should be removed from humans*        *btw I too have had my head smashed into a wall and had my fingers caught in a door*
I feel bad for you.

Mom: honey come down from there you can fall and hit your head.   And I say.  Me: ahaha mom am not gona fall  *Literally not even a second later I twist my leg and fall and hit my face on the table and shattering it*   I remember seeing a lot of blood me vomiting half of the way to the hospital.  And my mom said that in the doctors 2 doctors and 3 nurses had to hold me down cuz I was going all berserk   Well that’s my story thx if ya read it all.

Hey bryson do you play dragon ball legends or other animes games
I have a good pain story. This didn’t happened to me, but I witnessed it. So, I was at one of those resorts with a lazy river, and when the ride is over there’s a place to retrieve the rafts, a conveyor belt.  So, I a stupid 7 year old idiot didn’t get off, and was carried onto the conveyor belt, screaming for my mom. My mom hears and rushes over. She slowly extends her foot, and steps onto the conveyor belt. BLOOD EVERYWHERE. The conveyor belt was sharp and pointy as heck and ripped a whole ton of skin off her foot. It was probably one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen.

I broke my tailbone badly (or bruised it) I at least had a paramedic when I did it. The moral of this story is: don’t break or bruise your tailbone.
I laughed so hard watching this thanks for cheering up my day!

Bryson: "when you're really young your bones are moldable and stuff"  My littlest brother: * falls one foot off the bottom bunk and breaks collarbone in his sleep*
One time, I was being a buffoon like always. I was rubbing my knees on the floor. There was a top of nail sticking up and my knee jammed into and I said           AAAAAAAA   My dad thought I was being a idiot and yelled at me to stop randomly screaming. When he came back there he said: oops lol    JK      He put a baindaid on it the end 👏

Hurt moment
ldgo haminations
One time my leg became a valcono..... That was fun
All of my friends have broken at least one bone, and I’ve *SEEN PEOPLE break their bones, but I’ve never broken a bone myself. I think the worst pain I’ve felt... is... when I was on standing my grandmas bathroom counter this summer, cleaning her mirror, and then I fell off the counter. It hurt. A lot. I wanted to scream. But I didn’t.   *You wanna hear the story of the time I ‘saw’ someone break a bone? Alright then. So, it was in elementary school, and me and this kid (that I will call Zach) we’re on the monkey bars, and somehow Zach broke his arm. He fell off the monkey bars and cried. I just walked away.        Another pain story:  I don’t remember this one, because I was a baby, but my mom told me it. So, basically, my baby self was sick. And... there was, a BOWL next to my crib/bed. So somehow I managed to roll over, and I cut my head on the bowl. I don’t know anything else except that I have a scar on my forehead.
Someone else video The time I was in pain  Here is the only time I got pain  So you guys won't believe me but  I was talking to an idol and I said "But ______ I've never been injured before" Then he said "We can fix that"  Then I was hit, slapped, kicked unto the floor thrown in the air like a dog with a chewing toy, broken my bone, stepped on x1000 Then blown up
epic.
Woah *Im early what is this feeling*
3:50 pinhead
I’ve never broken a before too, post from metal bone gang.

Pain...
I love your videos
I recall playing on my cousins trampoline, we were playing a game where one of us was a ‘rolling log’ and we had to jump over one. It got to the oldest girls turn, she rolled on my ankle, didn’t realize she did and jumped on it, I screamed so loud that my mom found me crying on the trampoline. I sprained my ankle.   Recently, I rolled (or sprained idk) my ankle again on Halloween eve, my mom had to trick or treat for me.

At 4:37  Me: Memory lane? More like memory pai... Bryson: Memory pain Me: He beat me to it  1 like = 1 prayer that Bryson won’t steal my GOD DAMN JOKE AGAIN!  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  R.I.P Me making a good joke 🤣      I know this was way over the top and that this comment was kinda chaotic but, Bryson if you steal my joke again I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL HIRE ASSASSINS
#ham you are the fricki best i have watched you since 2014  you are by freaking favorite !
noww to tell you my PAINS!  first story: I was about 3-4 years old, and I was reaching to my mom, and the door slammed on my fingers. I cryed, and (this is not a joke I am dead serious) my soul left my body, I saw myself with teas and my mom holding me. when my soul went back into my body, me and my family were right outside the house.  second story: I stayed up late and I felt all the bones in my rib cage shake. the pain was so excrutiating I tried to faint, FAILED, and went to sleep.  third story: I stubbed my toe, and it didn't feel to bad at first. and the next thing I know Im in a wheelchair because of the pain.  fourth story: I got warts on my foot. one logical explination is that I shook an elementary school's teacher's hand, and somehow their hand warts transfered all the way from her hand into my foot. It wasn't to bad at first. it was very painful, but bearable. then about a few weeks later it started growing. my mom thought it was a good idea to put my feet in warm water. all 4 warts then merged into one big, disgusting wart. and one faithful day, I was brought to the hospital where they used a fucking knife to cut the warts off my foot. there is only one word to describe the pain, which is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH, but I had an elmo toy, and I was happy my family was there, so somehow I dialed it down to a nice, quiet, ow.   fourth story: I was 3-4 and I ran into a tree. The pain was unbearable. it leaves a scar even today.Im 15 btw   fifth story: I ran into a bush like an idiot.  last story: lets just say I hit the no no part, and it hurt.
*cracks bones cutely*
I remember when i was 8 i fell off a bunkbed and fractured my wrist
i got a 2nd degree burn on my palm by a smoke grenade on the 4th of god blessed July

i HATE pain
Existence is pain
When I was 6, I was at the park with my scout group. One of the playing things had a slide without the actual slide but just the frame. One of my friends slid down it with ease. I tried as well but before I started sliding I fell on the ground on my face. This was very high so I started bleeding. Pretty sure some of my teeth broke. Last month I figured out that it’s called a support beam 🤦‍♂️
Pain is what I feel when I wake up every morning
0:38 :  That could literally be a new kill animation for among us lol

Sleepy juice

I got a tooth pick then I started jumping in my mom's bed then I went side ways and blood started to come out and I went to the hospital 😃 btw it was on my ear
Fun fact: everyone says "Fun fact: 10 people can't be first"

Ok, I loved this video but just one thing I want to mention, it feels a little fast paced, jumping from one thing to another to the point where I don't have time to really comprehend it. I really enjoyed it though and cant wait to see more of your work in the future.
Ooh pain!
One time when I was like 3 and I was jumping from couch to couch, my mom told me to stop and I didn’t listen to her      And that’s how I broke my arm

-I'm losing blood at an alarming rate and would be most grateful if you, my caregiver and guardian, would transport me to the hospital to help heal the wound so that I can continue this mortal journey rather than ending it prematurely due to loss of blood-   eeaaaaAAAAAHFSKJHTRDVHJ

bryson: now i have a cool scar across my eyebrow me: oh i have one too i slammed my face on a windowsill when i was three
Nice
My Story- I don't really remembered about this, but my parents have been telling me this story multipl times. And I do have a little memory about what happened.  I was around the age 4 or maybe 3 at that time, and I was playing with my two older brothers. I was the youngest and only daughter. When we were playing and running back a forth in the hallway, I fell and hit my head at the corner of the wall. And it hit me pretty hard. I began to cry and my head was bleeding. When my mom was wiping the blood, she showed me the blood and I stopped crying. I was just staring at the blood all surprised. Until my mom saw something on my head, she can see a white spot. I remembered telling the story to my childhood friend and she freaked out. She told me that it's either your mucsle or your skull.  Anyway, they took me to the hospital and the doctors where stitching my forehead. But while they were doing that, I was talking so much to the doctors, they don't even understand of what I am saying. My dad told me that I like to talk a lot and most of the time, no body would understand me what I'm saying. Just babbling words. Kinda funny once I think about it. Now I don't really remmebered everything, but I do remmembered celabrating my birthday and my grandpa birthday. We decided to celebrate on the same day. At that time, I rememmbered wearing a bad-aid on my head. Now I have the scar for the rest of my life
Pain isn’t good
yay more videos lol  feel pain alot :) lol. and  i have had testicular torsion wich hurts much more after the operation ive tripped on a bike that made my finger not work for 2 weeks could still use it for 3 but was still hurting and ive not broken bones but i have "broke" my knee and it hurts some times. so yeah wohoooo i've felt pain...

When I was like 7 I was on Holliday and it had a kids club in a field in a pitch and the fence around it had a gate and it was terrible and had no hinges.and it fell... ON ME and like 2 other people so my supper human abilities kicked in and I freaking caught it. My small brain said scream “RUN!” And I did. I had literally saved 2 people. But then my supper kid abilities shut down from lack of energy and I used the last of my power to yet it back on the wall but I failed and it crushed me........ side note my 2 sisters were watching this happen...... side side note I went back their like 5 more years later and the fence ant the gate had been completely removed. I plan on making this an animation story video as soon as I get animation   Equipment
I just hate it when a pipe hits me at Mach 10

The door hinge thingy: POV: I’m in year 7 (6th grade) and I’m holding the door for my friend. Door shuts OUTTA NOWHERE! Timeskip: a week later. I have an x-ray. Turns out I had just broken my first bone ;u;
I ran into a wall once when i was little and hit the corner, leaving i think a 3 maybe 2 inch scar across my left eyebrow. But when i went to the hospital i held in my pain when they stuck a needle with some sorta numbing liquid insde the scar so i didnt feel the stitches. My god did it hurt.
that ending was not created by bryson. why?       there was no butt

Pain is life
I burnt the back of my to the bone big crater in my leg and it was painful
Here is a story of mine: One time I was putting my dog over the fence so he could "quote on quote" bond with them.  I climbed the fence and put my dog on a haystack, when I did though I lost all my balance. I fell over and had a huge scar on my chest. My mom was stunned and got the first aid kit immediately and wrapped bandages all around my body. That was one time I felt like I had lost all my blood
one time i ran into the corner of a wall...
I broke a bone when I was 3
I sprained my ankle on a trampoline once and I couldn’t use my leg for like a whole day. It hurt 😢
Bryson: I've never broken a bone.      me sitting here with my noodle arm
Isn't this all of us
00:08 *[Breath of the Wild ragdolling be like:]*
I love your videos
Pain.
pain
P A I N
The title is painful
Ok 3 2 1 go!        Dung
FAL
I have experienced a wide variety of pain too. The most painful one was the kidney stone that I had.
Pain is inevitable
Hi
“Ouchy feelings”
How did we both crush our fingers with no broken bones? For me it was a car door but still.
I’ve been injured on my left elbow in 1 grade on my way back to class I slipped on my lunch and my left elbow was bleeding and it felt like I had a rock in it
Who does younger you and normal you remind me so much of tommyinit
i love a good laugh out of a yt vid
the worst pain is scooter to ankle
Um
Hello?
Idk what to say lol
this reminded me about when I got stitches on my left hand and when I didn't even feel p a i n . . .
Yes, pain.
i feel you             i have hives😫😫😫😫
XD
He got cudged
You yes you you are FUNNY!!!
e
Bryson : I've never broken a bone.  Emirichu : *Welcome to the club.*
Pog
0:40 ive never broken a bone, proceeds to shatter all of this man's bones
That Title is my life
Bones aren't the only things that can break
Yay
I once almost died by a.... shoe las 😥
Pain is when Haminations uploads and you are ten minutes late ;w;
This vid was funny... one time I fell off my frigerator
The most pain I feel everyday is my everyday life.
Fun fact: The funny bone is not a bone, It is a nerve.       Why the frick does Bryson keep having the same stuff as me, I’m making a vid about pain, I hurt my back and I also haven’t broken any bones ALSO I was talking about how the funny bone is a nerve yesterday and he started talking about the funny bone (minus the nerve part) I ALSO HIT MY HEAD ON A FAN AWHAHEDFSHAKSJSHDC
When I was young, I was in a creak with my brothers and some random boy through a rock “over” my head. After I left for the ER, my dad drove me there but my siblings stayed behind with my stepmom. My sister says that when I left the boy turned to her and told her “she was getting annoying so I threw a rock at her.” I got a staple in my head from it and now I have a barely visible line where the staple used to be
All I heard was I went to the hospital
Relatable
A least your friend didn't round house kick your pinky
one time in 5th grade, i shut the car door on my thumb. surprisingly the second worst pain I've ever felt.
This is how many times he said “hospital” 1000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 …Read more        And Btw pin 📌 this plz
Me: it’s almost Christmas, maybe Haminations will upload a Christmas special Haminations: P  A  I  N
Speaking speaking your front pain I just hit my teeth with my phone
pain is somewhat good for the health
ow  like, when I watch this video all I felt was pain  #MEMORYPAIN
Hey Bryson how do you do it so funny
Hey you should actually put your trades in the video to
The Real pain is when you forget what you were going say in the comment section
Early🥰🥰🥰
“But Bryson, I’ve never been hurt. 👉👈” *”We can fix that”* **Proceeds to brutally mutilate a human**
I almost shat my pants just now because I stubbed my toe on the side of my bed
It’s been so long
Lol
This is just me in pain lol.  Even tho being in pain sucks.  Yes I’m watching this during my quarantine. Why? Cus why not. ✨👍🏻
Early gang

I am watching this while in shool
I’m not first   I’m not last           But most importantly               Nobody asked
no gain yes lame
I really love this YouTube channel
hi
My little siblings enjoyed this video so much
Final Destanation: Bryson Version
Oooh the door one happened and my nail came off and I was bleeding forever
Bryson: “Your bones are all moldable, or something like that.”   Me, breaks leg in recliner as a 5 year old: AGAPAHSJAUV   edit: my god are there a lot of people who looked at this comment 😂😂😂

Mom: walk it off Me: my legs are broken Mom!!!!  Me again: reeeeeeeeee!!!!
"But, I'VE Never been injured before.." Me:* Laughs in 2 Sprained legs *
Why youtube says that there are 3 views, 2 comments and 32 likes?
nice video bryson
Pain: Shot in brain True pain: 3:28
Me: Dude how many times did you go to the hospital Bryson: DJ Kaly Alot
HEY I have the exact same thing  I also fail pain especially when I stub my toe
Fun fact: the funny bone isn’t a bone, it is a nerve that is exposed from the bone, which means it is unprotected and is annoying.
Bryson’s stories: I was being stupid  Me: I was on my skateboard for .1 of a second and I decided I wanted to ko the ground exactly were a crack was so my dad had to buy ice and we made a snowcone out of my blood
My brother pushed me off of the bunk bed when I was three while I was on the ladder
I love it
oh god the fan one-
*I can sense the Terminal Montage sound effects*
Bryson: exists Universe: hmm how can we instill the fear of God in him

Funny bone go like: Ha that was funny but kinda hurt
Good video Bryson
*Now that’s a lot of damage*
I never broken a bone too, but I almost did one time when i was a little kid and i was fidgeting with my thumb and almost broke it.
The amount of times Animated Bryson has gotten seriously hurt in Animator Bryson's videos is so much. I call that animated representative/avatar abuse. Also, Animator Bryson, you need a compilation of all the times Animated Bryson has gotten hurt in your videos. (good comedy though)
It's pretty self explanatory from the title. Lol
Huh. How Ironic. I always experience pain on a daily basis...
Noti gang where you at?
That intro is quality content
I’m in pain
The title explains my whole life
Nobody:      Bryson's Edits: *STUPID AND VERY LOUD AGONY SCREAMING*
THE FIRST COMMENT HAD 2 REPLYS NOW IT HAS 211 REPLYS
3:23 not even gonna finish the clip
1:10  *Yes, it sure would be fun to wiggle on the ground physically*
I love this
Hii
At least u didnt get hit by a car like i did
When Bryson’s falling down The mountain at the beginning it please smash bro sound affects when he hits the rocks and stuff
P A I N
Ouch
Yes boi
Hi
bryson , i have a question , do u read any comments ?
Howdy stranger
the reason funny bones are called funny bones is because they're not actual bones, it's actually a thing of nothing but meat
pain
I've been beaten before.
Hooh this is gonna be a "Pain"full video...
The title is quite relatable
“Pain” *good title*
Fun fact:I once dropped a tube-top tv on myself... hehe good times
i’m a geno fan this is my video now
Poor Bryson can’t wait u till he makes perfectly cut screams uwu
Bryson: pain  Me: hehe bonk
3 minutes and already a thousand comments
Yes
Bryson: Pain  First bit of the video: die
Why does Bryson do sound effects please fix this it’s really distracting and cringey of course if you don’t want that’s ok but just saying I don’t like the pointless sound effects 😒
lol awesome video
Ahh, your butt jokes never siece to amaze me
Me: There’s some on you’re face Bryson: what is it? Me: *punch* IT WAS PAIN           I’m sorry..
Me: sees the title   Also me: ya he’s gonna stub his toe
I just realized that I haven’t hurt my funny bones in so long so I forgot what the pain was like :0
WHAT HAPPEND
Same.
When you step on a lego: https://youtu.be/0yOK1OZNqj4

Same
ouchie
Wow im so early my dad still has3nt left for milk
Title : Me: lol  me in lockdown
pain o who i love the
Why do you sound so loud even though my volume is low. Like no offense, but your mic or your voice is making my eardrums feel compressed and it's a very strange feeling.
It's been 3 minutes
yay
pain
The funny bone and the humerus arent even funny smh
I remember when i was like 4 I was playing with my neighbor in soccer and I tripped on the ball (you know when u accidently kick the top of thr ball and trip) and got up to my elbow down to almost to my wrist into our other neighbor's freakin thorn bush and fell but i dont remember anything past that except me looking at the huge cut on my arm
._.
I can’t imagine being able to feel a lot of pain I can feel almost to no pain
Can we get a compellation of Bryson just beating up some person until they don't even exist on this world
Life in a nutshell
Hi
I love it
He barely posts videos but i still like him
Are you alright from all that
The time I got hurt the most was when my parents were helping out with something at Church with my friend’s parents and I was chilling in the back of the car with the trunk open and then when they were done I jumped out not remembering the trunk above me and banged my head on it giving me a concussion. That was a painful day.
That yoda death sound and the studs came out lol
This is great. I have so many relatable moments in this, minus the fact I have broken a bone.
pain...

Pain is an illusion if you just don’t think about it, it doesn’t exist.
When youtube didn't notify you as soon it  posted  Me: How dare you youtube >:I
When I saw the title, the song from three days grace just played in my head
*death by ass clap*
pain.
Mood. Just in general, mood.
I was literally watching one of ur old videos.
After falling off Mount Everest: OWWW I HURT MY TOE
“At least I have never broken a bone!”        My mom broke the same bone twice. The first time by her brother. The second time by her own mom. Oh, and my little sister had a helmet on her head. She does not have it now.

Hi
I'm pain from naruto you know me ha
I’ve never broken a bone but my sister has let me tell you the story: One time last year my grandma and my aunt were on vacation and needed somebody to watch the pets so my sister volunteered and one day while she was babysitting she needed to charge her phone but the charger was in her car and my grandma has stone steps to get to her front door and my sister was on her phone and she wasn’t paying attention to wear she was walking so she missed the first step and she fell on her right arm I was told that she was screaming and there was blood everywhere eventually she’s out of her cast and OK
Damn, That hurt
Pain hurts
E
*Reads tile* Me: hey that’s exactly what I’m going through!!!
Disclaimer: no one cares who is first
