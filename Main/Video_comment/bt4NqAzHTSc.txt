0:10 #52 Taylor came off the sidelines 😂😂😂
Fantastic game
Looking at this game as a raider fan geno was throwing picks
RAIDERS 2022 NFL 1ST TEAM ALL PRO RB/1# JOSH JACOBS HAD THE GREATEST GAME OF HIS NFL CAREER.
Gngngbh
I was at this game. Greatest game I’ve ever been to.
As a Raiders fan, I’m so glad we refused to pay Jacobs. That was super smart./sarcasm I hope Jeanty is legit.

7:19 8:30 - 9:00 9:41
Don’t understand why the raiders did not keep Jacob’s, he is a beast
Coming back to this when jacobs gave me a 50 bomb in fantasy 🫠
When I came back to school all my friends had to wear raiders gear cuz they won🤣
McTrash going for field goals when his teams offense is rolling lmao
BEST ENDING IVE SEEN IN A NFL GAME IN A WHILE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

How did Jacobs not get totw on madden
This was the game where the team realized that McDaniels was a real jerk. He was furious because Carr called an audible on that last play.

Luke 22:51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
Josh mcdumbaas got mad at DC for calling the audibles that won the game...
Josh McDaniels is a dogshit coach, there is no way Carr was to blame for such a bad season. Waste of Josh Jacobs and Devante Adams. Hunter Renfrow wasn't even used . like shm
Dnd Josh I did know Josh Jacobs woning this game Dan 😀😁😎🥳
To a lot of ppl's surprise, Jacobs ran thru every defender all the way to the game winning TD.

Seeing the crowd in Seattle in a stunned silence was the best! Go Raiders! 😃👍🏾🏴‍☠️
The Carr morons will be like "great win". Carr literally gave the game to Seattle! Jacobs said no!
Seahawks always lose heartbreakers on cbs
The Raiders Nation was deep in attendance in Seattle, Wa. The Raiders Nation travels well .
Please 🙏 give Josh Jacobs a contract extension already!!
RAIDERS NEED TO RE-SIGN JOSH JACOBS, AMEER ABDULLAH, MACK HOLLINS, FOSTER MOREAU, JERMAINE ELUMANOR, ROCK YA-SIN, DURON HARMON, ANDREW BILINGS, JERRY TILLERY, &, DENZEL PERRYMAN.
I was at this game...Raider Nation represented!!

I needed 46 points to win my fantasy game for week 12 & Josh Jacobs gave me 48.2 😭😭😭
Cant believe some raiders fans were saying trade Jacobs last season y’all trippin I told people he was gonna have a bounce back season this year
Carr Adams Jacobs could be a deadly core if schemed properly with their strengths
This was my favorite game of the raiders season 🔥
What’s more impressive is having a top 3 reciever and top 3 rb this year and not making playoffs
Josh Jacobs 33 attempts 229 rushing yards 2 rushing touchdowns 42.3 Fantasy Points!

SEAHAWKS WHAT HAPPENEDUHHHH
It's only fitting that Jacob's finished it off after having a great game
josh jacobs is having a 1st ballot pro bowl year. hes the heart of this offense
12:49... D. Adams is a Bad Man! 😱
6:57 he shushing his own crowd
#28 Josh Jacobs   Need I say more?
God Bless the raiders
first play of the game during the int #52 runs out from the sideline to block, should have been a penalty that’s 12 men on the field
fire mcdaniels
The raiders are a great team, but the Seahawk's lost that game because of the refs. should have never gone to OT. Nice OT run by Jacob's 👍
NFL recruits their refs from the WWE 👍
Lincoln of Stockton was practicing that game?
Go Hawks.... but.  We are consistently outrun by the other guys' offense and when we do catch up, we often just give 'em a hug and then fall down.  There was a time when Hawks tackling was the best and we even posted some of our training videos.
😂
A lot of things have changed over the years, pink is in, equality is good, texting instead of talking, even enjoying our soccer team...on and on....but Football....watching good old American Football like this game, on the gridiron makes me feel like a real man again.   I even tell my wife to take out the trash.  Of course she's asleep, then I do it.  But at least the feeling was there.  What ....a ....GAME!
Maybe one day someone will put the PROFESSIONAL back in Pro football. Bunch of children out there.
Back n Forth SO CRAZY. WHAT A GAME !!!!
That o line was Mov'n people!!!!!
3:47 that's crazy
As a charger fan, f*ck denzel perryman all the way . I always liked him alot, hes a great run stuffer, and altho hes short, he has some POP! That Boy can hit! But for 4 years, he was constantly injured. Probably only played 50% of his games with chargers and was hurt the other 50%. Whether he had a season ending injury or a bunch of littl tic-tac injuries, i was ok with letting him go. But in 2 years with the raiders, hes played in almost all his fckn games?!?! There HAS to be something wrong with the chargers, they have been riddled with injuries for a decade
Im happy geno smith is a solid starter right now, finding late success. I hope they nake the postseason & he keeps it up for a couple more years. But god, was  this was a rough ass game for him.
WAY TO GO RAIDERS
4 thumbs up from a Niners fan... 👍🏾👍🏾🤣👍🏾👍🏾
Hats off to the Raiders big guys! That was well played!
Music reactions
RN4L just win baby
Absolute b.s. The Hawks won this game. Take your b.s. win cheap ass raiders. Metcalf caught that ball. Y'all got lucky with your crappy 4 and 7 team. Can't buy good refs anymore. Disgusting.
Man what a game and boy it's like teams forgot how to defend the run!! Running backs been really hurting these defenses. Awesome game though
Wow Hawks defense sliding all over the place...
13:29 that dude fell like a ton of bricks I am dead 😂😂😂😂
He stiff armed a 400 pound lineman for that awesome touchdown  RAIDERS 🥳🏉🙋🏽‍♂️✊🏼🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️🖤🤍🏴‍☠️💯💯💯💯
Incredible game and win for Raiders. However, the refs once again made some bad calls. The interception by Harmon was ruled no catch just because the ball bounced up off his chest as he landed on his back. He's really still in control of the ball. The one against Metcalf was a bad call too. Finally, Jacobs clearly got the 1st down on short run. I've seen this time and time again. The ref comes in and marks it a half yard behind the actual spot. The bad call against Harmon's interception and the 1st down for Jacobs both cost the Raiders. They still played well enough to win. I'm so sick of the bad calls.
Damn you know Carr was crying again 😭
The Raiders will be foolish to not resign Jacobs!
Raiders…never give up  What a game
Rigged
I've only seen one 12th man comment where they at
Fantastic Mr. Walker.
So did anyone else see 52 run off the sideline and block for Diggs?!
This was a really good game
what an incredible game one of the best games this season
Go Raiders you're the best one number one oh yes👋✌👍
5:54 😳
dude.... HOLY CRAP. NAIL BITER. nice to have things break our way for once this season. so many times that could have gone south!
Heads-up play by Moreau to throw his arm into the back of the guy in the grey suit's leg.  That fall coulda been far worse.
Jesus Christ is the king! Love me.
at 8:20 watch all the raiders players who were standing around while walker was pushing the pile
They CHEATED!🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
Wow, what a game!
Yo, if we don't pay and sign Jacobs I will be pissed. That being said, He deserves his "BAG"! If it isn't us, it will be another team. This performance guarantees him a new contract!
Need a reliable qb
Seachickens got slow cooked and served over a plate of rice
Nice run Walker!
max crosby has a hell of a year
Bwahahahaha.   Ahahahaaaaaaahhha.
Haw, haw! The Raiders pulled off an upset!
Proud of them Raiders.
I had a felling raiders were goning to LOSE
Both these teams suck
RN4L
That final TD run was like JJ was channeling vintage Emmitt Smith. Awesome play!
Seems like Geno Smith was struggling a lot this game
You guys made a mistake in the title. This wasn’t raiders vs seahawks. It was Josh Jacobs vs Seahawks
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE A DRUNK GF AND A BF TRYING TO TELL HER TO CHILL.on 8:33
Of all team's the raiders??.. Pete Carroll is the blame for his wack play calling
Keeping their playoff hopes alive!
Niners fans are salltier than Seahawks fans
so glad jacobs is on my fantasy team
Seachickens are garbage. Always have been, always will be.
So wished the NFL aired this game in my area rather than leaving me stuck with Rams-Chiefs. This was awesome to keep track of!
Pulled a JaMarcus Russell to win it! Yeah buddy
Gobble gobble turkey 🌊 🦃
Raiders with the upset.
ive hated these announcers forever when the chargers are being killed but theyre pretty good when its not my team
adams is a freak
3:50 that's all you need to show folks when they ask "Who is Metcalf"   Sheesh.
As a niners fan thank you LV
Too bad Jacobs didn't run into the tunnel on that final run like Bo Jackson did. That would've been the cherry on top.
That offensive line for the raiders 💪. Jacob's a beast 🤣
We mostly definitely saw the weakness in our team this game.O line and D line
re sign josh now
Old AFC West Shootout
When you talk a lot of $hitt and haven’t won the Super Bowl since 83, you might be a Raiders fan.
if russ was there they would have won
JJ  4 Reeeel
JACOBS 😤
Carr is terrible
I wonder why Seattle through that game
The Silver and Black seem to finally be firing on all cylinders...better late than never. Hopefully they can keep this momentum going.
That run by Jacobs was great
Metcalf really out there running dudes over
Let's win baby!!!! "The king of raiders nations 4life!!!!"~Al davis (1929-2011) RIP our raiders soliders. Congratulations to raiders nations win the toughest, roughest of this game of the seasonal week 12 against the west coast team from Washington state in seattle. Is Seattle Seahawks running us crazy points like 34 points. My team raiders nations got 34 points as well. It making it overtime. Josh jacobs had won for the ultimately offensive of biggest players zone of the year!!!! 303 yards in his career of 35th anniversary Celebration for the same old team. That's wild and exponentially crazy! Yeah! Las Vegas raiders has won the game. LV raiders 40 Seattle Seahawks 30. Beat by like up 10 points! Not bad after all. But my team raiders nations is win. Let's go!!!! Las Vegas raiders nations 4life!!!!
Brown's jaguars raiders my ml upset 3 legger parlay was awesome the so call experts pencil in  the ravens buc Seahawks a win
Convenient that they left out the highlight of that should've-been fumble by the Raiders in the 4th quarter!  That and the ridiculous incomplete pass call on DK crushed my Seahawks.  Brutal ending, not one to often complain about refs but this one stung!
LOVE IT
For an organization like the NFL pushing DE&I so much, can we all agree they need to put trans-men on their starting rosters ASAP? Why is the NFL so discriminatory towards the TBGLQ community? #boycottthenfl
It sucks that CBS stopped showing the Raiders game in the Bay Area.
Can someone plz put my boy greg gumble on primetime if u dont find him entertaining then you dont know football 🏈
13:30 😆😆
I bet the raiders are going to cut jacobs next season anything they can do to make the team less successful they will do it
I like fortnite
the slowest 8o yrd run in the history of the nfl
After all the hype the Seattle Seahawks falling down the stretch to 6-5 😂
It always made my day to see the WOKE Seattle teams got their behind whipped. Love it!
The Raiders' offense would be so fun to watch...if they only had a defense. They lose out on so many possible possessions because the defense is allergic to 3 and out.
The last play reminded me of zeke vs the Steelers back in 2016. Raiders rb is a beast
Shalise Manza Young is an animal. Pass it on…
raiders suck
8:32 land whale trying to score too, lmao.
At 13:38 for all my camera guy lovers what about him is that guy going to sue???? Lmao
A really good game!!
The overturned call on Metcalf catch (that took 10 minutes to review) was absolutely bogus. Completely different drive and likely outcome would've resulted from that call standing correctly. SMFH
The Seahawks cheated and still lost SMH
Where’s the decibel meter at, on that walk off raiders td?
What a game to bring my 8 year old daughter to for her first NFL game! Amazing experience! Go Raiders!!!
Nothin more fun than divisional match ups
I dont care if u score a touchdown to go tho ot time u dont celebrate u help the Guy u propably hurt him so bad respect please
To think they still haven’t resigned Jacobs. Literally the heartbeat of that team
I guess the Seahawk defense decided to take the day off with pay. Must be nice to get payed while being trash.
Whoever got Diggs on there fantasy team...great pick this week
12 men on the field defense Darrell Taylor
Straight drop 💧 💜
@2:43 Running back was open why would u make that bad pass into the endzone
The karate celebration was ass
I mean, I don't care for football, especially the flag football era, but Seattle should have just forfeit the game before it even started. They let and I mean LET somebody who will NEVER do anything in the N.F.L. run all over the place and barely made any attempt to stop him.  Just stay home. Pay the paltry fine for not playing and stay home next time. What an absolute embarrassment on behalf of Seattle.
Duron Harmon getting a pick and then getting it overturned is completely out of the question
13:27 no one see this dude get laid out😂😂
I love the raiders
It's sad how seldom the O-line gets credited for pushing a running back the extra yardage needed for a first down or a score. It's always the running back "fighting his way...."
Pay that fukking man
No one's talking about how Jacobs gave us the finger at the end?
Raiders wasted a year that could be impressive ... what a shame
Just incredible performance by the Raiders especially jacobs just insane.. Looks like the Raiders finally learned how to close the games with the W…. They’ve been good all year just end up loosing . They in the right way now Go Raiders
God I love seeing the Seahawks lose
Imagine having Joe Mixon and Josh Jacobs on your team. 2 games where 1 of them goes insane.  Oh wait…I don’t have to imagine BECAUSE I HAVE THEM BOTH.  Now only if Alvin Kamara and the Saints could get it together
Seattle needs to consider Malcom Jenkins to help out Diggs
Metcaf is waste of time
Josh jacobs went nuts😳
Crazy that they didn't show Jacobs fumble, but DK's "No Catch"
That dude at 13:30 ouch
Josh Jones gotta go and tackling needs better coaching
Great win!!  That was the Raiders 1st win in Seattle since 1998 and that was in the Old Kimgdome.  Maybe the Raiders can win out and make the playoffs like last year.  Just win Baby!!!
This was A game and a half !    Incredible on both teams sides of performance , BOOM !
Yeah, baby!  The NFL needs to televise Raider games both in L.A. and the Bay Area.  There are still many fans there.
Josh jacobs definition of clutch on that play🎉
LETS GOOOOO!!!
If your not a gold digger vote Ye 2024
3:51 Ouch
The Raiders are so underrated; their 3-7 record coming into this game did not do them justice. Winning this game hopefully is just the beginning of a comeback for a good team.
TULSA OKLAHOMA stand up josh was out there puttin on for the town 💯🗣️
I love this team when they finally get out of their own way JJ dem I hope Togo’s they resign him n drop someone else he’s to much of a game changer
Jacobs had more yards(303)than 6 other teams total yards this week. Insane one handed catch lefty nobody has mentioned(8:47). The Davante catch, Carrs throw to Moreau... spectacular. Crosby game wrecking as usual.
So your telling me that Oakland ran the 💩 out of the ball, but won’t go for it on 4th and 1 in the redzone.
😀😀😁😁😍😍👍👍United Kindom,Australia|Official registration in just two steps. 5 years of successful experience.
The first interception that Carr thru, a 12 player #52 came from the sidelines, while the play was still going.. Refs ain’t catch it 🤦🏾‍♂️
Not a raiders fan! But I love when the Seahawks lose lol
Jacobs is insane. Walker 3 is so good too. So fun watching both of them
As a 49er fan in pleased the Seahawks choked DK will never be a Top 3 wr with drops like that for the first down.
GG TO BOTH TEAMS IN THIS OLD SCHOOL SMASH MOUTH FOOTBALL GAME THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF FOOTBALL 2TEAMS PLAYING THEIR HEART OUT TILL THE LAST WHISTLE THE RAIDERS NEEDED THIS GAME AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD THEY JUST NEED A FEW SESSIONS MORE TO BECOME A PLAYOFF TEAM THE SEAHAWKS PLAYED WELL TO GENO IS A GREAT QB MADE SOME NICE PLAYS BOTH TEAMS DEFENSE WAS OUTSTANDING CATCHING A LOT OF PICKS GG BOTH TEAMS
#30 learned to go low on metcalf after he got bodied the first time 😂
Love the Raider fans at the end... had to laugh out loud 🤣
Best thing to happen is the extra Hawks player running on the field on the very first play of the game without getting called
Foster morrow is a d bag for that one at 13:30. Not even checking on him
I'm not a raiders fan but I'm so proud of how y'all played today and best someone in our division congrats well earned win
Seahawks really used that 12th man on the first interception of the game number 52 ran out on from the sideline 😂😂😂
Another Diggs making interceptions
The hawks D is back where it was at the start of the season. I swear my highschool team tackled 30 times better than they are. It's almost like someones paying them off to throw the game.  It's real bad when I can tell you what's going to happen on the last few plays of the game before it happens. Like the last play the hawks had in regulation play time when it ended with a sack along with the run play that won the game..
jacobs has exceptional speed .  also the hole the blockers made was vital for that 86 yard td run for the win in ot
8:21 Seahawks team pushed and pulled Walker in for the TD .  back in the day i thought that tactic was disallowed,  and the refs take too long to blow the whistle these days . And no , Im not a raiders fan either
I came so I can miss the OT win.
Raiders where at least not disappointing in this game
K9 was so open 2:45
Such a good game, had to come back and watch the highlights🖤
I loved seeing the Raiders deploy a fullback so much! I don't remember seeing one on the field for so many highlights in a long time
Seeing geno play this good this year makes me extremely happy. Hopefully, he stays with Seattle
Not a fan of either but Seattle Stadium is hard to play. When Raider there fans show up.
I'm a Raiders fan, but will say both teams played with BIG heart. Props to both teams!
I love you Seahawks, but godamn, play some rugby and learn to tackle.
Maxx Crosby is one amazing football player! What a game. This Seahawks' team is as tough as they come. Neither team gave in to the pressure. But, I have to say go Rrraiders!
Amazing game!!! Raider nation  Jacobs 🐐💙
My favorite team win
In Josh Jacobs we trust   In Carlson we don’t trust sometimes
Carrbage at it again
Jacob just save Carr career
Diggs and the interception
THE RAIDERS ARE AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!
im disappointed in the seahawks
The Seahawks are such trash 🤣🤣🤣 they are fakes🤣🤣🤣
Them Seahawk fans were SHOOK 😂😂😂😂
3:51 What a stick☠️
can we all agree this is a top 10 game of the year
Best game, this should of been the super bowl
How do you cheat with 12 players and still lose 😅
what a game!!
Come on hawks
8:36 beastmode, what the hell
I think the defense was just tired of tacking jj on that last run
Just win baby
On the first play of the game anyone notice how 52 is on the sideline when the pick happened and he got on the field and start to block?
I could only imagine what that stadium was like lol
Divante adams joins the one handed catching club with Justin Jefferson and Lamb of God. Also Jacobs must look like Bo Jackson running.
Good for Carr and the raiders.
We will take that win any day of the week!
So nobody saw Darrel Taylor run off the sideline onto the field on the first play😂😂😂
Both teams exemplified athleticism good competition the fans including communication😁
A quick 50 burger from Jacobs thank u thank u kept my playoff hopes alive in fantasy
Jacobs 🫡
So glad I got to travel and watch this amazing game. Couldn't have asked for a better first game to see!
It looks like the readers won the super bowl on this game
There is no defence in the defence ..11 men on the defence and all 11. Should  be going after the man with the ball not standing with finger up there butts
Bo said: " NOT easy to win a game."
Very entertaining. Competition too
GYAT they hit a brick wall! 3:50
Jacobs was clutch for me in fantasy
This man Jacob’s is such an animal so grateful I have him in fantasy
Between this season and last season  The raiders have had some crazy games
Honestly if the Raiders had a winning record, Max Crosby would be one of the contenders for Defensive Player of the Year that dude is a certified beast. Also shoutout to my fantasy MVP Josh Jacobs you deserve that extension brother.
You know the Raiders are probably going to lose this game because they just love to kick a field goal no matter what I don't get it.
“As a seahawks fan” 🤓
Seahawks have a very bad defense
One of the best games this season
Can one of you Raider Fans tell me what’s happened to Hunter Renfrow?
What can I say
Grew up in and around Oakland...  In Seattle now.  The game was TREMENDOUS!  Am wearing the RaidersT rn, though. Ngl.😉
To bad the Raiders going to be watching the playoffs at home
Nobody didn’t see dah bodyguard got knocked down 🤣 lol
Who agrees Jacobs is him 😤🔥?
Week12: @ the 12 man stadium! Well Josh Jacobs let Everybody know, Any given Sunday, any field could become A Raiders home game!
I thought I was crazy when I saw the exact same play twice , but then I remembered how bad the editors at NFL are.
As a 49ers fan I say this to the Raiders " Great job ...I know it's not easy to win in Seatle ...specially to come back and win in overtime so enjoy it"
almost 35 years to the day
did carr really throw an int second play 😭
6:10 no call on the face mask?
I glad the underappreciated legend Greg Gumbel who was Jim Nantz b4 Jim Nantz got 2 call a hell of a game.
Got Carr, Jacobs, Davante and Carlson on my fantasy team.  What a good Sunday!
where all my seacocks fans at???? get whoooopedddd...
Josh Jacobs and Kamara have both now destroyed my team this year
Ugh it hurts 💔
Geno doesn’t look bad at all he looks very accurate beside the interceptions he throws he got alot of upside
I hear brady this nd tht but wat about lockett im not a seahwks fan but he him
When Seattle pick it off at the bottom a 12th man came
5:50, my favorite play by Josh Jacobs by far
Haha hold that L Seattle
The fucken raaaiiiiiddderrrss
Jacobs has been so good for us all season, even when it seemed like we were trying to tank he'd put up those numbers.
Let’s go raiders!!! #Raiders resign JJ
0:10 if you look yo se seahawks bench the number 52 enters the field and starts blocking
As a long time Raider fan this game will always be remembered as one of the greatest Raider games. Josh Jacobs OT touchdown run reminded me of the Raider great Bo Jackson’s 91 yard touchdown run vs Seattle. It was like deja vu all over again. Josh Jacobs is a BEAST!! 💪🏽💯☠️🏴‍☠️
Dude's face at 15:56 'you have gotta be kidding me" LMFAOO
If u were there like me u could understand how loud it is!
Russel Wilson's fault.
Great 😊 job 👍 guys!
JJ is The Raiders Super Star
JUST WIN BABY 💰♥️♣️♦️♠️
Bro look at Woolen hauling on the Walk-Off Touchdown.
Was that an 86 yard td run?
Pay Jacobs already
We’re all gonna pretend like jacobs didn’t fumble? Like DK didn’t make that catch on the sideline. Refs handed this win to the raiders lol the holding on Oline the raiders got away with was insane as well
Taylor 52 runs onto field to block for Diggs on 1st pick.
Jacob’s might be the best back in Las Vegas since Bo Jackson
The Raiders fumbled the ball which would have ended the game, but Las Vegas and New York jumped on the phone and told them to not allow that play to be reviewed. The NFL is as fixed for Las Vegas gambling as much as the NBA. Fun to watch but at times the referees cheating is too obvious.
For real though they should’ve flagged DK Metcalf for hitting that defenseless player when he caught that sideline ball
NFL didn’t want to include the Josh Jacob’s 4th quarter fumble? Ruled down due to forward progress even tho he was stilling rolling forward? Never even touched the ground. And they didn’t include Metcalf’s reversed catch that they reviewed for 5 minutes before overturning. Refs ruined this game
Jacobs With The Run In OT
ALM
Most rigged game, that was a catch and everyone knows it.
Jacobs is a g! Great performance!
What a game!!!!
Letssss gooooo!!!!
No one’s gonna talk about #52 running on the field from the sideline .12 second of video 😂😂😂😂
geno carrying without a run game and defense… Scored 34 and lost… This defense needs lots of help
In the words of Brent Mustberger, who called Raiders games their first year or two in Vegas...JACKPOT BABY!!!!!!
Who else had Jacobs in Fantasy😎
Great game between the two! To all who think the raiders are going to flunk for a better pick. Think again, WE ARE RAIDERS AND WE'LL GET WHAT WE DESERVE AND WORK FOR IT. The goat is Derek Carr and and everyone who plays for the team. This game is a lot like construction work. Insert men who want to work to win. Both sides of the line, you all deserve it and keep going! Don't think about another ot keep doing what you do! Defense did a great job against DK. Nice containment
Defense played like ass
Карр (QB, Raiders) в 1-й четверти был в ударе - два отличных паса в руки защитнику Seahawks Диггсу :) Карр, он такой, всегда на грани между потрясающим пасовым розыгрышем (сколько bomb он накидал за карьеру) и серией обидных перехватов. Повезло, что в соперниках был Джино Смит (QB, Seahawks), который в этом матче тоже не стеснялся кидать перехваты :)  Отличная перестрелка! Карр кинул несколько красивых пасовых TD. Игра держала в напряжении - какая из команд допустит роковую ошибку :)  В итоге в OT исход матча решил забег на всё поле Джейкобса (RB, Raiders), он весь матч был активен и эффективен, надежная опция в атаке.  Рад за Raiders, вторая к ряду победа в OT. Надеюсь, теперь психология команды восстановилась окончательно после того жестокого поражения от Saints
Metcalf caught that ball.  Also, I was skipping around looking for the Raiders fumble that the refs took away because " forward progress was stopped". I heard the game on radio and it sounded like that was a bad call, which essentially kept the Seahawks from running out the clock.   Then again, the Raiders win does make three Seahawks pick from the Broncos more valuable... so I guess this loss has a little value.
Seattle defense played horribly. Josh Jacobs made us look like a peewee defense.
Am I the only one to feel like the refs robbed us. They didn't call the turnover when it was a fumble. Them they ruled out incomplete catch when 14 caught the ball. . B.S.   ain't saying Raiders didn't platy a bad ass game. Cause they did. But C'mon man
P.
Seahawks was too full from thanksgiving dinner I see🙄 we will bounce back next game
I’ve watched the highlights over a 1000 times today. Love my Raiders all did an outstanding and Amazing job. 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🙏🏾😎
Love too see it
I'm just here to see the seahawks lose. Mission accomplished.
Chiefs fan just here 😳 because 😎
It only took three months, but the raiders finally won a one score game!!!
Beginning of the video..#52 of the Hawks ran onto the field from the sideline to block after Digg's interception...smh lol
Bro, that was a fumble, could’ve sealed the deLy
3:51 As a Raider fan Abram would’ve clamped Metcalf number 30 Harmon too weak .
refs won the raiders the game
So funny to see  Seahawks#52 run onto the field after the interception ;)lmao...Karma
CROSBY, ADAMS, CARR, JACOBS AND MOREAU 💯💯💯
Happy for the Raiders on this one. I see a lot of improvements in their plays since Mcdaniels became head coach.
Can't stand the Raiders but damn Jacobs is the truth I can't hate on him
Raiders sucked most of the season but chose to play good against Seattle... however the play calling was not very good just using the same old running plays over and over just wasn't working and the pass play was off... Pete Carroll should be gone after this season it's obvious he's the weak link now not the QB or team
Geno and defense were doing their jobs however the play calling falls on Pete Carroll doing the same old running plays used to work perfectly but not so much now because they don't have the offense line they used to... Seattle could have won but play calling was wack
Great game
That stiff arm was dirty top ten for sure
What a game
Man the raiders running game is the difference maker in this one. Absolutely insane. Turnovers obviously helped as well.
You just can´t defend Carr´s performance. Take a closer look at every and each of his passes in this game or the past one, and they are always MISPLACED, either too late, behind or too ahead of the receivers.   Dude has lost self-confidence and needs to go.
Should have come back. 12 men on the field for Seattle 🤬
Wish I watched this game instead of the cardinals ):
I was still traumatized by the Russell Wilson trade but now that I know that he's not as happy as you were sad I can baby get back to being a 12 again
Голдл
Thank god I have Josh Jacobs in fantasy
2:44 Walker wide open, come on Geno
Is nobody gonna talk about #52 from the Seahawks running onto the field from the sidelines while the play was still going after the interception?
We need to get rid of Adam's and they need someone like Wagner asap
That was a fun game to watch
Should’ve been called for the horse collar by the raiders defense I hate refs nowdays that should have been called smh fluke ass win for them
exciting game
RAIDER NATION BABY 💯🖤🏈🖤🏈🖤🏈🖤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
And nobody catches bo ….I mean, Josh
Raiders you guys should pay Josh Jacob the money cause he's worth it... by the way not a Raiders fan.
Seattle defensive line is trash.
Wooooooooooooooooooooohooooooooooooooooooooooo
Boy did the refs screw this one up.
Hey what about LB #52 of Seattle in the interception ??🤔🤔 , Check 0:10 he’s on the sideline, and then 0:13 he’s blocking
Just wanna point out that the defense still gave up 34 points and the offense had to win a shoot out again. If the raiders woulda lost this game it would have been another week of Derek Carr couldn’t do it 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ glad they won so now the derek carr bashing can not be a thing for at least 7 days 🙏🏽
Beginning of season “Glad they didn’t pick up his 5th year option. He’s injury prone anyways”  Fast forward to week 12 “Can’t believe they didn’t pick up his 5th year option”😂😂
Taylor should have gotten ejected for coming in off the bench during that interception. This REF crew needs to be slapped down since they were clearly looking the other way.
The arm tackling all damn game, if half the initial contacts resulted in a tackle, Jacobs and Adams would've had half their yards, just infuriating.   On a side note WTF, how can those Refs spend 3 seconds on a forced fumble and reject a challenge flag, but pull out the CSI team for that catch/ no catch, f---cking wild. Seattle should've been in a better position at the end of the 4th, but the Refs sure did seal that deal. Shame
no one see 52 run off the sidelines in the first highlight??? 😂
DK caught it.
Josh Jacobs and Maxx Crosby are dogs unfortunately
Pay that man, best RB right now 🔥🔥🔥
Why Derek carr always crying? Dude is pathetic
12 men on the field penatly: * exists *  The refs and Seahawks: We don't do that here.
Raise your hand if you lost money because of this game 🙋
This was a good game proud of my Raiders and much respect to the Seahawks for some great competition
Who else peeped the last sack max Crosby had with his hands looked like 2 shovels
Germany broke the young guy's spirit
Raider blocking ate up the Seachickens on this play.  Safety gets a face full of turf!! RAIDERS !!!!
Great game now we got to BEAT LA BEAT LA BEAT LA
Jacobs, Adams and Crosby my goodness that's all you need!! God bless raider Nation!! Let's keep this winning streak alive from here on out!!
DK should have 100 yards every game
I got Josh Jacobs in Fantasy
What a game between two excellent teams with great QBs. Trevor Lawrence now looks like a #1 overall draft QB. What an arm, and what a smart QB. Not taking away anything from Lamar, but what a game.
Run, Run
Geno don't want that money
Offense should win games
GG by both teams. Crosby with clutch plays and please pay Jacobs. This man out there just running all over the place. I mean Damn.
What a game!
raiders still suck they got lucky with that dk call smh
0:25  Adams could've catch that ball...
Sounded like that 12th in Seattle were all raiders fans
Try not to block the channels I had to use my phone app to get scores & listening to the radio
Harmon played dk very well
Lockett is incredible been killing it for many years. #13 at least slow him down that was an ole
Jacobs just continues to play his a$$ off every game...This might have been his best game as a Pro
Jacobs the best back in the league right now! Plain n simple!
Underdogs all the way good game both teams played hard
☠🏴🔥
I knew this game was Rigged I aint even watch the game looking at the comments. WWE scripted who win Games
AFC west NFC west is a division that's all hype that division wasn't never quite as good as what it is know I just have to laugh 🤣🤣😆
...hey Derek !  You let a "big guy in a little suit" catch you! Ha 🤔
So nobody’s going to talk about number 52 coming off the sideline and blocking in the middle of the pick 😂
The Refs had to rig this game because I bet big money on it and las Vegas didn't wanna lose alot of money. I got Proof too
...just like the packers, the raiders suck
Defense came up clutch
Gg raider nation. Go hawks.🤙🏾
Genos gonna injure everyone on his team with the throws he's throwing 🤣
lol Metcaf caught the ball
thats a big run
Josh Jacobs 303 total yards. JJ left the Sea-Chickens Sleep-Less in Seattle!!!
SeaPigeons are a joke,they been living on borrowed time for a while now.
Wow!
12th man on the field. LOL
Darrell Taylor should be suspended for at least two games for running on the field in the middle of a play.
Was that first penalty for the judo kick? Lol
Loved that first play of the game... was such an awesome interception Taylor (#52) comes running off the sideline to help block, 12th Man indeed!    0:09 look bottom of the screen standing next to the guy holding the yard to gain marker (bumble bee shirt)
It's easy to win when you have three turnovers and a terrible off the defensive line.
You wouldn't really realize it from the highlights, but Jacobs had an incredible day.  229 yards rushing on 33 attempts and 2 Touchdowns on the ground, 6 receptions for 74 yards; giving him 48.3 points fantasy Full PPR.  Just WOW.
F you sea c*cks
Did Darrell Taylor run onto the field after the first Diggs interception as the play was going on 💀  0:11 for reference, look at the bottom of the screen in the middle
Seahawks are not contenders, poor fact.
Greatest slow play all time letting Russell Wilson go be trash in Denver
Jacobs lookin like Emmitt Smith out there
Well well. The analysts were trashing Russell Wilson and the broncos for getting beaten by the Raiders. Now what are they going to say about the Seahawks. Because this loss was much worse.
Let's not get carried away with this RAIDERS WIN 😂😂😂😂  I still think McDaniels needs to be FIRED
Thank you Josh Jacobs haha
I thought the Raiders was going to get killed after Carr threw that 1st int
To bad the nfl is rigged
Mad maxx is worth every penny. Josh jacobs is a monster management is crazy to even think to let him go,sign him right after the season is over. Adam is a man amongst boys he comes to play ever game.i'm tried of waller we need to trade him for some offensive line help or a draft pick. I know when healthy he's good very good but he can't stay healthy thats the problem.
this season has had some nail biters this is up there for one of the best games of the season
Looks like the Raiders had PAM sprayed on their uniforms...no grip for my Seahawks to tackle them lol!
And that’s how I lost my fantasy season 🎉 at least go Raiders 🔥
5:55 that stiff arm doeee
What a game
Ngl this hadda be the game of the week easily
After that first interception how did they not get a flag for having a 12th man on the field blocking 🤣.  Taylor was on the bench when the game started and came in after the interception I started blocking LOL
At 3:51 the way DK does that man dirty 😂😂😂
Things get kinda interesting if the Raiders beat the Chargers this week...
I took this loss personal !! Go hawks
Good game by my Raiders...Adams with that one hand catch tho oooooo weeeee
Jacobs is a Superstar!!!
Nice to see the woke city get beat.
Nobody noticed 52 running onto the field after the INT and just start blocking? Seattle is taking their 12th man to another level.
That was such a great football game. Lot of fun.
Josh McDummy, despite the win, is doing his best to lose games. I hate the fact that he’s our coach. The guy shouldn’t even be the head coach of a high school team.   Respect to the Seahawks in this game. They’re better this year than people thought they’d be.
Top little to late. LV needs a person who has them ready to play with confidence. they have the players
It was amazing watching my brothers snapchat hearing the raiders fans when JJ ran that 86 yard td in OT
Raider nation !
I hate to say this, thanks Raiders from beating the Seahawks. from your old neighbor the Niners. ps  Tell your owner the upside down salad bowl Moe looking haircut is the bomb.
I hate when they say he’s a washed rb I’m telling you he is gold I just wish he had a winning team
Derek Carr must restructure his contract & take a big pay cut so the Raiders can re-sign 1# running back Josh Jacobs.
Josh Jacobs speed will be going up in Madden after that long touchdown
Pay Josh Jacobs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Raiders are better than the broncos and NFL has the audacity to say they are not!
Metcalf caught that tho?
So now Derek Carr is 11-2 in OT.   Next closest is Brady at 10-4.  Wait Hasn't Brady played 13 more seasons then Carr?
Hope Raiders play with this kind intensity for the remaining games
About time the d line get some push props to Andrew billings
Wow, what a Game.  Da Raiders!!
As a niner fan lol thank u raiders
Pay that man 💸
Who is #26 get rid of him
i was there yesterday sitting on our side of the field and i will never forget that josh jacobs run. RAIDERSSSSSS
Had a 9 winstreak on fantasy. Guy i played had jacobs. Winstreak over.
seahawks shouldve won this game tbh but its whatever it was a good game
Imagine if Adams didn't make that one handed grab where the defender was holding his left arm and no flag was thrown.
Go raider's!!
This will be one of those games that will live in Raider lore for generations to come!
Raiders have their "star triplets" which is an old West Coast Offense term,  back in the '80s and '90s certain teams had their QB, RB and WR and built around their star-triplets, in this case Carr, Jacobs and Adams. Raiders are about 5 new starters away from being a serious contender. I just feel sorry for Carr it's taking so long.  Raiders need to spice up the O-line, although they do look pretty decent at times such as this game. a better TE, Waller is pretty much gone and Moreau just isnt stepping up like a big boy he drops the big boy play too often. A dominate DT, a sideline to sideline LB and a dominate Safety,
The 3 interior raider o-linemen were whooping ass the entire game, fantastic performance
Thank you Josh. Carr thanks you too
Going against Jacobs in fantasy was a boss fight
Sounds like a home game Raider Nation was in there deep. Good win boys RN4L ☠️☠️
My 49ers thank you Raiders for getting it DONE
The one thing I took away from this game is Carr is definitely not the guy. Need to move on in the off-season.
Awesome game. We appreciate the highlight 😊
Hell of a game!!!
I was at the game and it was amazing!!! Seriously the best game I’ve ever seen in person. It helps I was 7 rows up from the field on the 30, on the Seahawks side. It was the most fun I’ve had in a very long time. Just win baby!!!!!!
Raiders look ok this year tho
My Broncos are already out of the running, but the Raiders could still capture a wild card spot.  I hope so.  Nothing would make me happier to see the Raiders go into Kansas City and beat them in the playoffs.  Denver did it as a wild card team years ago, then went on to win the SB that year.  Go Raiders.  Although I still don't care for cheater Mcdaniels.
We traded for Yasin and he can’t cover for 💩
I'm getting 2021 Raiders flashbacks... these games will give me a heart attack. LFG☠🏴‍☠
Im sorry but that incomplete call on DK was one of the worst calls I've ever seen!!! There was no evidence to concretely over turn his catch and it was obviously a catch.
52 comes from the sideline and starts blocking before the play is whistled dead. What a joke the refs missed that. 0:12
That 1 hand catch by davante adams was insane 😮
RN4L🏴‍☠️!!!
Jacob's is a MONSTER !🙌🏴‍☠️
😮
0:09 how tf do you throw it an INT with no pressure in your face? Then at 2:11 why don’t you take the check down to get closer to the 1st on 2nd and 8 JJ would’ve at least got 6 yards
Walk off TD by JJ Looked scripted but I'll take it!....#RAIDERNATION🏈
Josh Jacob Jingleheimer Smith
13:30 hope old dude ok.
Feels Good To Win 2 In A Row 🙌🏾 Let’s At Least End The Season With A BANG Raider Nation!!!!
We Need to do a lot in the draft for the defense !!!!
Our defense played horribly today and our O-line was crumbling way too much and not giving Geno enough time. There was also some questionable calls like that fumble near our endzone that was ruled a down. I'm happy for Carr though, raiders are better than their record suggests.
The Seahawks are chokers! Their name should be Seattle Chokers. Bench QB Smith. He can't hold onto the ball in the red zone! Two fumbles in scoring position. Terrible! The defense is horrible too.
Josh mcdaniels is Trash
What an absolute shoot out between these two teams but one cannot deny the Raiders defense shut down the Seahawks ground game early and all game they pressured smith forcing him to make throws down field that resulted in INT's or fumble's regardless this game was no lackluster game up until the final moments with a game winning touchdown by Jacobs the last couple of weeks this Raider team has been playing at the level of a high caliber team most of us had expected they would of done early on in the season, its a very exciting time for the Raiders regardless of their standings they're learning to win as a team and in the last two weeks we are beginning to see resilience and continuity over all a winning spirit!! GO RAIDERS!!!! a tea
48 fantasy points easy 🤟
Competitive, fun game!
😲😲👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Seahawks defence can beat any team right now but they need to be consistent.
No reason Raiders should not be 8-3 now. They are a great team
This game reminded me of the years when the Seahawks were in the AFC west. The games between the Raiders, the Seahawks and the Chargers were epic games usually decided by whoever had the ball last. Good game
Now they wanna wake up and start playing football GREAT game RAIDERS lets go and start stacking up Ws PLAYOFF BOUND.
shocking in Blue!
THE LAST PLAY WAS HOLDING ON THE FULLBACK BUT THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT 😂😂😂😂
Shout out to Raider Nation that showed up felt like a home game.
Refs and defense sold 🤦🏽‍♂️💔
For the next season the Raiders need defense, defense, defense and then a little bit more defense.
PAY JOSH JACOBS THE MAX CONTRACT PLAIN AND SIMPLE!!!!
Damn 9ers win
Great win for the Raiders. That said, thee play calling was absolutely horrific! Run play on every(and there were tons) 3rd/4th and short whilst Seattle was stacking the box. 3rd and one and a pitch 5 yards back? And 4th and INCHES, EVERY team(except LV) runs a QB sneak with the trailing RB pushing him forward. Had they lost, you wouldn't hear the end of this.....
What a block by Jakob Johnson on the last play 🇩🇪
At 05:54 during touchdown run: overt facemask from Offensive 28 (the ball carrier) against Defensive 99.  Dude has his fingers wrapped over top row of 99's facemask.  Raiders would have lost if they'd caught that.
Did they throw a flag on the karate kid celebration?
The Raiders nearly lost with a running back rushing for 230 yards. A game should never even be close with that amount of yards on the ground.
🤣Started at the bottom now we still here. Drake- carr- devante
A seahawk is a bird but what are the "Raiders" supposed to be? Terrorists? If you name your team after terrorist pirates then it's no wonder your children grow up with such a warped view of the value of life.
Has there been a Waller sighting? 🤬🤮
Josh should've run through the tunnel and into the locker room (Bo Jackson).
Crosby and jacobs won this game for us. This was a well needed win for us. It ain’t over till it over lets run the table! RN4L
As a Seahawks fan, i knew that they would lose the game, because they always do, when the win is crucial Congrats to LV
One hell of a game! Congratulations Raiders.
What a great game. Love this type of shootout games.
Df sucks
and JOSH JACOBS bust the game open with a big time 86yd TD run in O.T
What a surprise 1st highlight is. A D.C INT 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They better sign up jacobs again with n extra bonus
I hope we keep Moreau that dude is so clutch and just embodies a raider ☠️
Pay that man Jacobs...
229 rushing yards 2 tds 🐐 and 78 rec yards
😂Anybody else come to see Darrell Taylor  #52 come off the sideline to block and the refs didnt flag it? 00:03 hes on the sideline by the down marker at the bottom. Then you see him running later.
Thought this how we where gonna play all year …. My raiders are always a mess lol
“Let’s Ride” the Saga
I used to think money runs the world...but it's actually Josh Jacobs
Seattle's QB is a disaster. Hehehehehehehe. #wakeupdeadman
Seeing geno play this good this year makes me extremely happy. Hopefully he stays with Seattle
What a great game. Both teams played excellent games and it looks like they were a good match. But the best team of the day won and Congrats to The Raiders. Viva Las Vegas!!! So proud of you guys representing my state!
Wow. The only good game of the day.
I’m a Steeler’s fan but live in Seattle and was at this game cuz I love the atmosphere there at lumen. but i gotta say this is one of the worst reffed games I’ve ever watched. Sorry Hawks fans
Love that OT win!  Go Raiders!!!
Raider fo life!!
Seahawks lost but that interception on the opening drive was nasty🤮
talk about the offensive line for the sliver and black plus the defense making plays we know our RB got down today
Refs decided the game. What a shame for the league. Now hiding the proof. The raiders fumble in the 4th quarter is not shown. The DK catch was perfect. Reviewing for hours and then canceling it. Digusting!
As a 49er fan, DK made that catch...
✌🏾
Running backs that get the big runs owe it to the big guns up front.  If it wasn't for those guys it wouldnt be football.  Raiders have one of the best lines in the league.    I cant say the same for my team the Broncos. The whole country knows how bad we are in the suck.  Never the less i still love the bums and have been a lifelong fan since 1965.  My hats off to the Raiders on their victory.
1:35 Admeer Adbulah almost round-house that Seahawk player with that TD celebration. LOL 💀
Raiders!
I was trying to see this game live but plans where canceled and I thought to myself if this game goes into OT it would’ve been worth every penny
Bloody RAIDERS!  😲 They find NEW ways to just about give me a heart attack every week! So glad they actually won this one.  👍🤗  A season of "what might have been..." M 🦘🏏😎
Half the size of Henry….3 times the effort
Let’s go raiders!! - 49ers fan
"Metcalf's first catch of the day" -- Star Wars
Can anybody tell me why Jacobs fumble wasn't reviewed? Still learning about the game
I cannot believe the Raiders didn't pick his fifth year option ! It's not like Josh Jacobs was a bad running back before, even if he wasn't THAT dominant, he was still good enough to be a valuable player on the squad in my humble opinion. Props to him to carry on with his game and becoming one of the elite running backs of this year on the field !
Beautiful
Number 13 for the Seahawks need to be traded this the 3 week I’ve seen him not make a play and he has clear opportunities like he doesn’t know how to tackle
Lol Derek Carr threw an interception in the first 15 seconds of the game 😂
The look on those Silenced Sea squawk Fans, Priceless.
Jakob Johnson with some fantastic blocking this game! Need more of him
Good game... praise God for life ❤️💕🧬
Ladies and gents....the next big money RB, Josh Jacobs....
The lack of Jacobs highlights is kind of ridiculous - why have 5 yard dink and dunk plays whilst Jacobs is slowly building to 300+ yards?
Jakob Johnson - Tank!
That review of the Metcalf catch was a killer.
Might be on to something.  LETS GO RAIDERS.
....... It's 4th and inches why wouldn't you qb sneak it... Toss the ball 5 yards behind you to get inches🤔🤔🤔🤔
carr cryin again?
GOOD
Crazy game. Jacobs had total of 303 rushing yards? This crazy and a legendary performance from him!
AWESOME GAME !! RAIDERNATION from Germany !😆🖤🤍🖤🤍 !!!
Good game
That's more like the raiders we like to see
JUST WIN BABY RAIDER NATION THE ONLY NATION
The raiders are a really good team. The problem is the coaching. Ps get ready to get annoyed by the seachickens fans they are going to make excuses like the NFL doesn't want Seattle winning lol they are the worst ban wagon fans in the NFL.
Finally!! At last this is HC McDaniels' TEAM!! They played well & JJ28 MUST REMAIN A 💰RAIDER💰!!!
As a 49ers fan, would like to thank the Raiders on a great win. Need to distance ourselves from the Sea chickens.
Seattle's 12 Man 🏟️....🤫!!!
Why no one is talking about that dressed up guy who got tackled? Is he ok?? I didn't watch live so
49ers  fans says thank you
3:46  Metcalf casually levels the sh*t out of Harmon💀
Crosby and Jones doing they Thang🔥
Prayers up to everyone going against Josh jacob in fantasy 😔😔🙏🏼🙏🏼
The raiders deserve that one
The way Jacobs runs with the ball, reminds me of Emmitt Smith, wow what a RB he will be if he stays healthy
Jacob’s baby
I'm asking Santa for a Jacobs Jersey this Christmas
SeaChickens lost to the RAIDERS!?!?? hahahah
13:30  A guy almost gets crippled.
As a Seahawk I am once again proud of our offense and Geno great game, but wtf happened to our defense after the Munich game, the complete defense lost the thread after the bye week! Carroll needs to fix this right now or I'm looking at the black side in Geno's first year for the playoffs! As a German I'm happy for Jakob Johnson, of course, but as a Seahawk it really hurts! But wtf are the Refs calling at 0:57 , that was a clear catch and it was called as that , It was never clear that he didn't catch the Ball to overturn the call !
We deserved to lose, no excuses. Defense was non existent and the offense was inconsistent. GG Raiders, Go Hawks
Thank you, Josh Jacobs. Won my fantasy game this week because of your monster game.
Am I trippin or the dude in the stands at 12:34 looked a lot like Pete Carroll
RAIDERNATION JUST WIN BABY WE GOT ANOTHER (W) LOYAL TO THE SOIL AMAZING JOB RAIDERS CAN I GET A HELL YEAH RAIDER FAMILY
Another raiders record breaker against Seahawks
Great job Carr and Devonte😃✨
Happy Thanksgiving to the raiders
Jacob is a great running back much love to BARRY.✨😃
Great game by both teams.
that dk no catch call was complete bullshit. the call on the field was it was a catch and from the replay there was no way that was conclusive enough to change that. huge point in the game. along with the fumble no call for the raiders
gg
carr still needs to get the boot
Jacobs is seagurls  new daddy now
WoW.  Metcalff made that catch two times in a row and they didnt give him credit?   SKOL
Salty ass raider fan I saw… I’m a raider fan btw 😂
This game was fuking bullshit.  The refs gave it away, that call of Jacobs down by forward momentum was garbage!!!!  That was a Josh Jacobs goaline fumble in the 4th quarter and you know it!!!
Crybaby Carr 😪
What a game!!!!
From 49ers THANK YOU Raiders !!
Amazing game. Don't care for either team but that was very entertaining.
Imagine thinking you're a good team being 1st in the NFC West and then losing to the Raiders at home.⚰️⚰️
If your last name is Diggs, you’re defense rating in Madden is automatically 99
JACOBS IS A DOG ADAMS IS A DOG CARR IS A DOG CROSBY IS A DOG PERRYMAN IS A DOG  #GORAIDERS
that bad call on DK no catch .. cost the game .. wow ...  Good game Raiders
Seahawks overachieving lol iam shocked they won as many games until now. Niners should win division but of course they always make things interesting lol
Raiders improving with time in the system.
Jakob Johnson does a really good job and gives Josh Jacobs some nice blocks. He deserves some credit for what he does out there.
5:55 one of the best stiff arms of the season
Rob the end zone pic smh 🤦‍♂️ what you mean the ball didn’t touch the ground
As a Seahawks fan with Josh Jacobs on my fantasy team, the feeling I felt after that walk-off TD was indescribable
@3:51 Buddy hit a brick wall 😂
Great game!!!
What a fucken game!!!!!!! JUST WON BABY!!!!!!!!! RAIDERS!!!!!!!!!
He delivered for me in 2 leagues. I'm currently up by nearly 61 pts in one and up by less than a point in the other.  Just need Harris, Pittman, and the Colts D to not score a combined 61 pts and for Harris to not finish with negative pts.
Raiders got the West Coast on Lock San Diego use to be covered in Black at Chargers Games
It's begun. The league will figure out Seahawks, Geno will turn into a pumpkin, and there is no longer a Russell Wilson there to bail them out.
Lol Seahawks and Broncos are going to end up in the sitting at home for the playoffs lol. The bird was cooked for a late thanksgiving
What about that karate kick from Abdullah? LOL🤣
As a niners fan living in Alaska the only time I’ll ever root for the vibeRaiders is when they’re playing the Seahawks. Soo many Seahawks fans up here and they’re soo annoying!!
As a die hard NINERS FAN and faithful I thank you Raiders for beating the Seacocks.
Jacobs was beast in this game! Literally won this game as a 1 man wrecking crew!
PAY THAT MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be fair, I didnt see the game... But the guy doing color-commentary should have been wearing a Seahawks jersey
As a niner fan thank you raiders !
He runs hard for the money. So hard for the money.
Josh Jacobs in my fantasy team baby!!
Hey NBA, how about this 15min+ highlight? Wtf is up with limiting everyone (and the official NBA highlights) to under 10? Take note.
13:31 all the air got sent right outta that big thomper…worst cutaway moment. We need a better angle on this takeout.
I’m fine losing this cause y’all def studied walker shutting him out the whole game. Off day for the hawks fs
Man I loved watching Jacobs in Alabama football. Dude is electric.. Great story
Way to go Raiders! As a Niners fan, I say thank you for helping my Niners get one step closer to another division title.
I’m so proud
I love to see Jacobs win
Jacob’s is god tier ☠️🏴‍☠️
I cannot believe this upset
Watching a bunch of Seahawks fans go silent is so fun. They're such mouth-breathers.
3:49 Is nobody gonna talk about DK Metcalf taking another insane blindside hit from 2 guys and j eat the hits like butter like thats insane. He just gets hit and doesn't even budge
Rigged.
Im honestly surprised there aren't hella butthurt Seahawk fans, yall played a hell of a game and to be fair if it wasn't for stopping walker even with Jacobs going off and Crosby getting sacks we would have had another close game loss
Its amazing how much Adams has boosted Jacobs production
That was an epic game even though I wish the hawks won
GG Raider nation. Coming from a Chargers fan who resides in Seattle. Fucc da Hawks ⚡️ ⚡️⚡️⚡️
Watching from Greece.hi everybody. Never understand this game(rugby) but I must say what it's a very powerful exciting game.
3:51 my lawd
Id like to thank Josh Jacobs for gifting us the 7th NFC playoff spot for the week.
Bruh. Jacobs is unbelievable.  I'd love to have him playing for my squad
13:30 someone should’ve pulled homeboy out the way 😂😂
Jacobs with that Barry Sanders type of vibe
I think I have won 4-5 games this year in fantasy purely because of Josh Jacobs. Best Player I drafted because I got him for cheap in a dynasty league!! Love him!
Time for Pete to go. Pathetic on both sides of the ball.
Josh "Just Win" Jacobs
Raider nation baby
how is nobody talking how in Carr’s first int #52 was on the sideline and ran into the field and threw a block…..
The Raiders is cooking 🧑‍🍳 16:25
My favorite player of course josh jacobs! L carr
That stiff arm to that Lineman by Jacobs was something awful!!!! Geesh Us!. Great win Raiders
This game will go down as the greatest OT victory in Raiders history. WHAT. A. GAME!!!  This W is  for the record books. JOSH Jacobs is a monster!! 🐐🔥🏈🏴‍☠️ #JustWonBaby
That flea flicker oe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤝
Correct me if I'm wrong... This "unexpected" loss leaves the Raiders in third place in the division... so the Broncos are fourth and last!  Does this means the Seahawks are the real winners in this game?  just asking for a friend 🤔... Very clever if so!
Still Screaming Rrrrraaaaaiiiiiďddeeeerrrrrsss!!!!!4L!!
Both teams battled in this one. Seahawks offense did enough to get the W. Seahawks defense has been very inconsistent this season. Coaches have a lot to figure out after many of us thought they had things figured out.
Josh Jacobs you make Tulsa so proud... #BlackWalkStreet 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Legendary ending,  number 28 get your money
Because that's what he do.
The "found his man"... idiot "Greg" (commentator) needs to learn some new vocabulary.
Jacobs looking like Thurman Thomas 🔥 Niners first place!!! Thanks Raiders
WTF
3:51 Random UA day for Metcalf tomorrow
F A C T S - P E O P L E - H O L Y  S H I T - S O - S O - S O R R Y _ B U T - 1st play of the game - SHITTY PASS intercepted ! THEN - touchdown scored by Seattle - THEN - Another SHITTY PASS - Totally Uncatchable to Moreau in the end zone - Missing a clear touchdown - Adams has to make spectacular catches Every Game - because of SHITTY PASSES - AND - WE CANNOT BEAT STRONG TEAMS - When These SHITTY PASSES - Happen - Every third or forth pass - EVERY SINGLE GAME !!! - Paul Glover football grand master analyst
where has this team been all year 4-7? wtf should be playoffs team with this kinda recievers and running backs!
🏴‍☠️
Dude caught the ball. Seattle won that
Raiders played a hell of a game but to say DK didn't make that catch was a very bad call
If we can just get waller and refrow back at the right time please..
12:34 am I the only one who caught the guy(far right in white) flicking the team off 😂
Jacob Johnsons Block 👍👍👍
Bahahahaha. What happened to the Seahawk D?
I guess the raiders had hawk for Thanksgiving LMAO way to go raiders #RN4L
Now as close as it was the raiders ran the ball all over us. This loss definitely hurts
Jacobs top 5 RB easy
#28
Metcalf had a clear catch...
So happy I put Josh in my fantasy lineup:)
Our nemesis, the Raiders, strike again. Poor D and good Offence
Waller, Renfro, and Jones got big money and have done squat! Jacobs not re signed, he will go to another team. Typical Raiders..
Raider Nation!☠️🖤🤍💀
I'm glad I was playing against Jacobs this week. My goodness I probably had like 50 points...lol
If josh jacobs ain’t in the silver and black next season I will kms
Seahawks got beast moded on 😂😂😂😂😂
Raider Nation
The win is weak, nearly lost, and does not inspire confidence in McD to be better than Bisaccia.
49ers fan here thank you raiders :)
Jakob Johnson is a beast Fullback 🔥
Raiders prove that running the rock wins games in a pass happy league...Jacobs was great and blocking was outstanding
RAIDERRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSS ‼️
Jacobs is electric. Hope he gets paid next season to a competitive team
15:35 Seahawks fans
The DK Metcalf call was terrible and so was the fumble call
Is it that Carr can't lead his throws or that he thinks his receivers are slower than they are?
Sick watching the Hawks lose like that.
Need more evening games
https://youtu.be/PPrWMNOPrGE LOCKER ROOM MUSIC🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️🦈
Jacobs is my player of the game and the run at the end was great, but my play of the game was Crosby ragdolling Geno Smith on 3rd and 5 to stop the Seahawks drive in OT. 😎
Duckin Goodell
That was an EPIC game!
At 0:09 seconds 52 on the Seahawks came out the slide lines to block💀
Josh Jacobs Went OFF
Yeah despite not caring ab our record cuz we're losing, losing record is still a losing record, but I wanted this one. We see them every year in the pre season, glad to see them in real competition 🥃☺️
Josh McDaniels, for someone that's talked about like he is such an offensive genius, he has got to be the dumbest play caller I have ever seen. If not for talent overcoming his stupidity, Raiders would have lost this game too. Runs on 3rd and 2.. gets nowhere.. decides to go for it on 4th and literal inches and calls a pitch?! Is Carr such a statue that a QB sneak is too much to ask of him? And then he calls for another run on 3rd and 1 and of course gets nowhere and loses a yard.   I have barely watched any Raider football this year but watching these game rewinds shows why Raiders are 4-7. If not for talent, this team would be far worse. Defensively, there is no hope there. But offensively, they had no business losing to some of the teams they lost to in the past 5 weeks or so. Especially considering the teams they faced! There is more than enough talent on offense.. which makes me think last year's playoff push wasn't a fluke. McDaniels was a terrible hire. If Raiders keep him another year, it will be much of the same next year.
Go Seahawks 4 Life win or lose
8:25  I love those rugby scrums!!❤
This week Josh Jacob's with a break away run. What an excellent game over all. On the road love it Raiders in the building.  Team effort Seattle put up a fight though Vagas Raiders cane through   big time.
We need to tank next year for Caleb Williams. He will be able to go toe to toe with Mahomes #RaiderNation
Carr just relieved to get another win.
Josh Jacobs really carried this team to a win with his legs. Impressive.
What’s crazy is the raiders are 4-7 with a -11 point differential
This Raiders team runs on David Carr’s tears
Thanks for winning this game raiders for us niner fans
I loved seeing the Raiders deploy a fullback so much! I don't remember seeing one on the field for so many highlights in a long time
Chandler Jones has finally done something for once this season! Hallelujah!
Glimmer of hope for Raiders...maybe next year
😂😂😂😂😂seachickens
Any notice after the 1st pick of the game darrelle taylor ran from the sideline to block for diggs🤣🤣🤣
Jacobs is so underrated.
DK metcalf needs a new team and a new QB! He could be great
Ameer Abdullah touchdown celebration on diggs is cold😂😂
I'm a 49ers fan but I was rooting for the raiders to win today why? Because now the Seahawks are 2nd and my 49ers lead the NFC west😎
Josh Jacobs was beast mode for about 3  years now people notice him. Dude looked like the second coming of Marion Barber out there but better balance.
Anyone else think DK Metcalf is playing the wrong position?
why don’t he have 92+ speed on madden??????? #28
Josh Jacobs should be a raider for life.Dude is an amazing football player.try not to screw this up Mark Davis
Wow.
Soooo did anyone know what happen to that guy standing near the end zone who was hit after that touchdown?
Feels good to win two in a row. Need to keep motivated for higher ranked teams.
Give Carr time, this boy has dimes in his pocket forreal !
Why to go Raiders great victory 🏆 ✊🏿👍🏿
so.. can they play spoilers from here on out
Lmao ahh!!… suck it Seattle!!
Worst thing about raiders they didn’t pick up 5th year option for josh Jacob🤣🤷🏾‍♂️
As a Seahawks fan, that was a good back n forth game to watch. Thanks and well done LV!
I don't know if you noticed it but did you see car go to the ground and thank God that finally we did it he was just saying thank u god
As a Seahawks fan I need to say that the raiders played very good in this game. Respect
there is no RB better then him,,since week 13 last year this man is possessed...defences have no answer..
Great win.  But our pass defense is horrendous
metcalf got robbed tho
Thet should change the rules from.......... does he have control of the football to........... does the football hit the ground.
Ah the story of the raiders. Never playing well till it’s too late. Whether it’s in a game or for the season. I couldn’t imagine being a raiders fan. The constant let down of it 😂😢
4-7 lowkey lmao
Pay my man Jacobs! Damn, that was a hell of a game, from both teams. That roar when Jacobs hit stride to the TD, #RAIDERNATION was representing.
🎉
Seahawks games are always entertaining af 🤣
Thank you Raiders! ~49ers
It's interesting that this video didn't show the play where the referees screwed Seattle out of a win.
This is the one time all 49er fans were rooting for the Raiders to win...
Can’t think of any time I’ve ever seen a non QB put up 300+ yards. Insane!
Raiderssssss
This Raiders team definitely has the talent to become an elite team in the future. They need to get rid of some of the players that aren't putting in the effort and in opinion go after Sean Payton.
Raiders turning Geno Smith into Jets Geno Smith who still owes someone money. 😂
It's usually never no fun when 2 teams on my permanent list face off - nobody to root for in such cases - but somehow I gave a Whoo-hoo! to the "heritage" crew [beating my Redskins in SB 18 is what sealed the deal on them for me] for their vanquishing of them moldy-ass Screech Owls [I like Derek Carr & he deserves better, + 1 of My Dudes stays out there in Vegas Baby - having to hop between them & his hometown Bares, po thang 😄], which the 1 time those Buzzards could've been of some use - in a Super Bowl which # mercifully eludes me - Pass-Happy Petey blew it like the Santa Ana winds, cementing his place in the B column of NFL coaching [the Atta-Lanta Pigeons though mismanaged to do even worse than that].   But who the hell was it edited this footage must be a direct descendant of Lizzie Borden, it was so damn choppy! Jeez! The play-by-play calling was more than serviceable - that long-past-it old dolt "michaels" all the more sharply in comparison needs to be kicked to the gate so fresher voices [still greatly in need of refinement as to content & alertness] can do the job [& take that overrated overpriced skeletal-detailing "joe buck" too! Plus, in the "colorLESS" category, that lightbulb-headed grainy whining "collinsworth" AND "bony dummo," of which like the Grinch griped, "I cannot stand in the LEAST!" the slightest fraction of a sound outta those, so my mute button & battery supply are In Constant Use to shield mine ears.]. Now that this triumph is over - sigh, that view of Derek Carr in such an emotional state on the field afterwards was so heart-tugging - these Raiderses can resume their position on my list until/unless needed again: like them still-miserable disgusting Boo England Paytoilets, which standing as the lowest of the low in American professional sports [who knew, even more so than the non-Houston team in TexAss] will never change, or the Tampa Bay Suckaneers to which Portapotty #12 slimed to, & was taught a HUGE lesson in "quit while yer ahead" today by of all crews, the Cleveland Browns. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Now mortally wounded, though it won't concede such, I can hardly wait to see, with lipsmacking glee, just who it will be delivers the last skewer into that pathetic elitist's career guts. "It won't be long now!"
so glad i started jacobs in fantasy
PAY THAT MAN!!!!!
49ers gonna spank the faiders in a couple weeks!!
I counted 3 separate holds on that last run. 😂 Not a fan of either team. Just saying.
Just Win, Baby.
That was a weak ass penalty on Abdullah...
This game had Super Bowl feels
A Niners fan says thanks.
Josh Jacobs activated his Bo Jackson (mode) in this game.
1 handed catch by Adams was epic!
Jacobs
Damn it Seahawks! You’ve let the Commanders take your spot! Now the whole NFC EAST is in the playoff picture
Jacob's was on beast mode for this game. Good back and forth kept us on the edge! Hard place to win but well deserved 👏
Time to spank those Low voltage! Bolts next week.
It’s a love hate relationship with these Raiders. Just am glad that the chemistry is getting there, but I’m still questioning mcdaniels playcalling at times! Love how Carr and Crosby are taking command of both sides of the ball. Adams and JJ are and have been BEYOND ELITE this season. Even behind the story of JJ, he’s made it this far and he deserves everything in the world!!!  We desperately need Hobbs, Renfrow, and Waller for next week now  RN4L☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Can't stand  them thug Raiders, but thank 4 beating Seattle.....you gifted us 1st place! See ya in Jan, we gonna send a u boys to prison! 🤣🤣
Gotta love The Raiders today.
Great game!!!
Raider fan here when Jacob leave to get paid may GOD bless him he deserve every penny of what the raider won’t pay 💰 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
So close. You hate to see us lose in OT but it's okay.
I feel like the raiders only seem to win when it's in overtime
I’m so upset with seattles defense this game
Jacob's raked especially if you had him in your fantasy football league
Amazing effort put by both teams, the raiders played well and it was peak performance by both sides of the ball on the raiders side. Amazing football game. #RN4L
Epic game
Jacobs footwork is CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZY  !!!!!!!!!!!!! He also has great vision.
Did anyone help that guy up on the sideline at the end of the 4th QTR who got knocked down by player, or they waited to the game was over to help him back up.
Metcaf caught that!
that good run.. well-done raiders.
Jacobs, Crosby, and Adam’s are the GOATS
No one talking about the garbage calls? Really? The fumble call into the call against DK catching the ball that took 5mins to do as the defense got to rest. Pretty trash. Good job hawks sorry refs were against ya.
This the results when you spread around the offense. When Carr stops locking onto Adams and use all the weapons they have. Great win for Da Raiders and awesome game for Jacobs.
Seattle's defense showed up as a wet paper bag for this game
49ers fans thank all the Raiders hard work today.
Where’s the play where Jacobs fumbled, they called it down by contact, Pete challenges then it’s suddenly Forward progress? That’s a highlight? That was a pretty big play
Cheating mfers....can't stand these rigged refs ..they instantly make up some bullshit saying it was "forward progress" when it was clearly a fumble and then take their sweet sorry ass time to say Metcalf didn't catch the ball....sooo many bullshit calls
Seahawks defense remembered they play for a poverty team
These games, are pretty much our playoff games, just won baby
Wow. What a fun game!
Having Josh Jacobs, Ekeler, and Josh Allen is killing it for my fantasy team. Plus I have Carlson as my Kicker..I'm dominating.
This game was the best one of the day
Please sign Jacobs ,, get rid of Jones and sign Jacobs
As a seahawks fan I'm embarrassed that we lost to the raiders. Seattle played sloppy on both sides. Droped 2 games in a row now. They better wake up or they can kiss playoff goodbye.
See what happy when Jacobs plays, unbelievable game!!
It just saddens and hurts me that after this year I'm sure the Raiders are going to let Jacobs walk and he'll get his deal somewhere else..😔
that DK metcalf catch reversasal pissed me off so much, awful officiating. but we still deserved to lose, couldn't stop Jacobs
Jacobs and Maxx were unbelievable today. Maxx single-handedly destroyed their offense and Jacobs single-handedly hit the gaps, snaked through defenders and got stronger and stronger all day long. That’s the best Raider performance that I’ve seen since Mack and Carr teamed up to destroy teams in 2015-16.
Only cholo tears of joy today.
To think Jacobs was the first RB to be drafted in the first round and it wasn't till the 16th pick.  That studder step he had is deadly
So who's gonna be the winner
Greg Gumble: "Travis Horner" lol!
Jacobs is a monster Raiders got a good one
The Fact that they DIDN'T EXTEND #28  FOR THE 5TH YR,IS GOING TO HOPEFULLY COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM 🤣😂, IT'S WHAT MAKES THE RAIDER'S THE RAIDERS!!
the first interception carr threw number 52 on the seahawks was on the sideline then jus jumped on the field. strange
First play of the game, 52 from the Seahawks comes off the sidelines to help during the runback of the interception. 😅😂
We live in Las Vegas and it’s such a nice stadium we have here. But their record stinks. What a dismal team. Never watched a single game. First time today because I wanted to see why they stink. But the way they played today? It doesn’t add up. They actually look pretty good. They need a few more key defensive players. Than watching that running back break for almost a 90 yarder? He’s pretty damn good. Like a diesel train. Maybe they can have a winning season and come back next year and win 13 games. I think they are better than the record shows. Pretty good first game. Like the old black & silver from way back. Hard hitting dirty players the Raiders I remember. So let’s win another one next week 🤙🏻
Wow What A Game! There Is Nothing Like NFL Football 👌👍
That was a football game.
I think this was the best game today.
GO RAIDERS
JJ that dude
and this seahawks fans (and im one of them) is why we need to calm down a bit and stop the all the hype talk. there are still alot of hole that need to be filled. we are still a outside playoff team.
THE WAY JOSH JACOBS STIFFARMED THE NOSE TACKLE LIKE NUN ON HIS WAY TO THE ENDZONE 🙈🙉🙊 if 5:50 isn't a Top Play on Sportscenter tonight I dnk what is!! Daaaaayyyuuummmm...! ! !
Whoever is making the thumbnails for these videos is a F'n I diot. If you show a player from the winning team in the thumbnail, you've spoiled the game for people, are you re tarded? Do I have to explain this further? You're showing a raider player in the above thumbnail, so now everyone knows  they won. Do you understand????? Stop with the F'n thumbnails!!!!
The fake noise just got turned off
How was that Adams one handed catch not a PSI on the defense though?
Carson had to break his 100% field goal percentage in overtime 🤦‍♂️. Still came away with the win. RN4L. The rest of the defense needs to get on the Perryman Crosby production line. 💪
The Raiders have apparently gone back to letting Carr air the ball and are the better for it,  Hes not that bad of a QB .....just let him do what he does! the Hawks were in the game as well just they got shut down on the ends, and still a swiss cheese defense!  doing better than I thought they would this season though!  I still think Pete needs to go away!.......its time to find a new coach!
As a niners fan I usually root against the raiders but today I'm glad they won. This game was a nailbiter for sure, but the raiders pulled it off by Jacobs in overtime and that dude is good. Good game raiders and any Sunday when the seachickens lose it's a good day.
As a Niner fan we want to say thank you RAIDERS!
Raider Nation On Minez
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂 I was WONDERING WHY i didn't hear any cheering in the miserable streets of Seattle this evening when I was working & got stuck in post-game traffic, downtown........ I said I'm not even gonna ask; LET ME CATCH THOSE HIGHLIGHTS LATER. Quite-naturally the birds WOULD have trouble with hard-charging pirates...  Raiders, y'all should thank US for softening up that defense for y'all....  Let's go Tampa Bay!!!
What a game‼️‼️
YES GO RAIDERS
We gotta be playing like this everytime! Let's gooooo #raidernation
Haha sea chickens!😂
Let’s not forget the refs helped yall
RAIDERS ASSUMED   T H E   'H O M E    F I E L D"   a d v a n t a g e  in this Game.  Happy Days in the World Wide RAIDERS FAMILY.  The Raider Faithful at SeaHag Stadium was  FELT AND HEARD !!!!!
What. A. Game. Hats off to the Hawks they're having a great year but what a game. Loved it RAIDER NATION LFG!!!!!
RN4L
Pay the man  Jacobs that is
I live in Olympia Washington and I root for the opposing team every time since they went woke.
That Harmon INT in the EZ was valid. So what the ball moved around...it never touched the ground. WHAT IS A CATCH NOWADAYS?? 🤔
Need a new QB, but Jacobs carries the team💯
Anyone else notice they played the same play over in a row at 13:38
What a game...raider nation goes beserk
Wellllll ... alllllllllmost went the whole week without a duplicate play in the highlights videos........ Smh. How hard can it be?
Man I was at that game and me and my dad was screaming and we were so happy that raiders won
Seattle was horrible in the red zone.
Great game
Also Jacob’s ty your the man !!
I need the radio call for Jacobs’s run. Man went off
As a Niner fan, I thank you Raiders 🤝
Seachokes !! Fire them all !!
Love seen the guy with the sunglasses 😎 ., hahahahahahaha lol
303 yards… JESUS. What a game for Jakobs. As a Seahawks fan, game recognizes game.
Jacobs is the Man; what a nail-biting game
The difference between this seasons Jacobs and the Jacobs from the last 2 seasons is he's been able to stay healthy. He's an elite RB when healthy but closer to average when banged up. It's a gamble on his health more than his ability,signing him to a huge contract.
Was at the game. Raiders O line played great. Awesome game to be at. Raider Nation showed up! rN4L!!! LFG!
I knew we were going to Win . seahawks can Kiss IT LMAO
Great job Jacobs. I thought for sure Seattle was going to win but very glad they didn't
Yup. It’s that time of year where the Raiders are going to start giving us heart attacks. 😂
LVR W in a thriller OT ,Jacobs exceptional ground game enable W against a spirited Seahawks.....🙌
Left Seahawk fans flabbergasted in OT Jacob's 🤣🤣
3:48 my god metcalf is a beast
WOW
Wild game - both teams made big plays , but Seahawks defense was too weak and inconsistent for whole game - Raiders offense had biggest success for a long time , especially Jacobs 303 yds. - but officials are wrong to disallow Seahawks catch near the end of regulation - that ball was caught and it was between both hands and it didn't touch the field , so what the hell is wrong with that ? How much possession does a player have to have - does he have to shove the ball down his pants ? The officials have to stop fixing these games just so the game goes into overtime - too many bad calls by officials this year.
The refs know that was a catch by DK smh
Ima 9ers fan thank u raiders
good win on the road for the raiders, they needed this againts a hot seattle team,,,  josh jacobs is a monster, and people gonna hear about him !
Of course they won’t show the fumble by the raiders right before the tow minute warning.
Let's hope the rams don't steal #28
No
Another 1
No
Go Raiders!!!!
No
All those carr haters ..where are you??
Jacobs with that stiff arm! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LETS GO RAIDERSSSSS
Josh Jacobs really pulled a taysom hill
some trash calls but jacobs...
Im Josh Jacobs on my fantasy team 🔥
As a Houston Oilers fan, I say the Raiders should have shown Jacobs more respect during the offseason.
🏳️☠️🏴
13:30 Might want to get the hell out of the way next time my guy
One hell of a game!
Seattle… wtf
I was at this game and I got to say that is was insane
Now this was a old school Raiders win Raider Nation rules and kicks ass !!!!
Raaaaiiiddddeeerrrrrrssssss !
Jakob Johnson - Fullback from Germany with a beautiful block on that game-winning TD. Guter Mann!
RAIDER NATION
Aaaah 40+ fantasy points from Jacobs 😌
28
I been sayin man Josh the best rb inna league juss feed em the ball he hungry 🦍
They totally screwed Metcalf on that on that touch at 57 seconds in the 4th quarter. I tell you what! These refs, and the ability to look at replay and still determine plays incorrectly there's just no excuse. Versus the giants, my Dallas Cowboys number 88 CD lamb was robbed of a touchdown after a miraculous back of the end zone first right foot touchdown left toe tap and then the hill consequently comes down afterwards and they saying that it wasn't a catch. What it really was was a robbery. And I'm not just defending my Cowboys I'm defending any team across the league doing a great football competitive game how they come in and just get the wrong determination Time After Time. Something must be done because it comes down to games at this time of the year plays determining playoff births.
They don't have a chance of making the playoffs.  Another year of losing !  Las Vegas wasted the taxpayers money building that stadium  !
Refs again smh
Raiders very well could have been 9-2 if some of those late games went there way
Pay that man
Good job seahawks
Nobody saw the suit guy getting tackled!!! 13:29
How often do you get, arguably the 2 best receivers in the game in the same game?
Refs robbed us. Oh well
Throw a penalty for a guy celebrating when the guy shouldn't have been nowhere near the mother f***** NFL you are trash that's why no one wanted you we watched the highlights I don't know maybe I'm just old and I can care less anymore about sports but a 10-minute highlight videos better than watching it and f****** sitting through commercials I ain't got that time to do with my life commercials and ads and s***
Jacobs is such a beast. That quickness is otherworldly in person im sure.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Show me the money!!!!! That's what Josh Jacobs is saying to the Raiders.  I sure don't want him to leave the team. The old saying goes Cash Rules Everything Around Me  CREAM get the money dollar dollar bill yall.  🤑
Thank you raiders from the red n gold!!!!!!!!
DK definitely caught that
I know Jacobs is going show me the money in the off-season
Two weeks in a row with the walk-off win I f****** love it let's go Raiders
There goes that man 🥲
I have told you 100 times CARR is the weak point of the team.
Maybe Pete Carroll will stop chewing gum and look like those girls waiting for a customer.
13:32 😁
WIN or lose I'm a RAIDER FAN!!!!!!... love that run up the middle 😁😁😁
13:30 got me dead
What a savage way to lose .
Wooohooo limp gay Seattle lost!!!
Shehawks... get that ass in second place where yall belong🤣🤣🤣 good win raiders
DONT GET TOO EXCITED RAIDER NATION👶 , YOU STILL ARE NOT GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS ! 🤣🤪😂🧐
Game of the week !
Looks like a college game
Mad Maxx just keeps on grinding!!! He Kept us in the game with that sack
As bad as the season that we have I tell you this one was sweet.I knew that we can go into Seattle,and beat them first we had nothing to lose, they had plenty to lose they're trying to keep up with the division in the playoffs. Second the city of Seattle teams especially the Seahawks has a long history of cracking under pressure. They have always been that type of team. Josh Jacobs crush the Sea Chicken defenders.
Josh Jacobs and Crosby popped off. Good on the Raiders. They showed up to win. Seattle defense was not great this game (awesome picks by Diggs though). I think if the Seahawks were able to run the ball better we could have won. I don't like to blame the officials, but we got ripped off on 2 plays. Sad loss, but good game.
Hey look at the weather the fairweather fans are out RN4L
Amazing game good day for all Raider Nation👏🙌🙌🙌
Legion of gloom.
No worries Seattle, the Denver Jackasses lost yet again. Currently in line for the #3 pick in the draft. Plus you'll have plenty of cap room to pay Geno if you want, and pick up some guys in FA, since you don't have to pay Wilson the zillions of guaranteed money he gets now.
Jacobs the goat 🐐 #beastmode
Imma give props to the sea hawks they fought, but raiders came out on top, hell of a game.
dumbest play call when Jacobs fumbled
Every Raiders game is like watching a video game. They're the most exciting team in the league, win or lose. My guys.
Josh Jacobs having season of his career!
2 interceptions and u still lose. wow.
HELL YEAH RAIDERS !!!!    TEAM EFFORT TODAY !!!!! 🍻
This game was ruined by the missed fumble at the end that would’ve iced the game. Referees just can’t do that.
Saw this live at T-Mobile Park. Incredible how quiet it got in front of Seattle's home crowd
Most complete team game by the Raiders all year, against a good Seattle squad.
Did not see the game ending like that but LV got their sealing blocks in and Seattle's safeties were slow to close. Good win for the Raiders. PS: Seattle's offensive line was hot garbage today.
We won the Mack trade
pay the man
This was definitely raiders best game
13:30 😂😂😂
If Josh Jacob’s don’t get a superstar badge in madden by the end of this week cuz he’s been consistent and this was the stamp
As a Niners ran, I just want to say thank you Las Vegas, thank you.
My mindset....after the shitstorm 10-7 finish last year I still believe we go on a run! I became a McDaniels fan after seeing that 4th n 1 playaction bomb to Davonte vs the Chiefs! Good or bad Josh has balls! RAIDAZZZ!
Jacobs went off. Over 300 yards of offense! Best RB in the NFL
What an amazing ending! Unfortunately, I didn’t see it as NFL RedZone told me to switch to my local CBS affiliate, but 60 Minutes was on. 🙁
Yes yes 🎉thank you Raiders from a SF 49ers fan 🎉
😭
Seahawks played a poor game against the raiders, I don't expect them to win anymore games after this one.
Stiff arm?  All I see is a facemask.
AYFKM. Not to mention the opi not called against D. Adams as he held defenders right arm down .
Omg 😂😂😂😂
On the last play, Raider #45 is HOLDING but referee is blind as ussual.
Let’s goooo Raiders
LVR actually stole victory from the jaws of defeat instead of the other way around.
What a total rob by the referees!  Jacobs wasn't down, the ball was stripped and Seattle recovered before the tying score. Total Rob!  Fumble recovered by Seattle!  34-27 final. Also Raiders have a 2nd and 15 and Bruce Irvin about to sack Carr and the tackle pushes him down from behind, no call results in a pass to Jacobs picking up 13 yards.
Daniel Carlson owes Josh Jacobs and the Raiders OT defense a gift basket.
What a game. One of the best of the year.
#shovelsup
As a niners fan I approve these results 😁
WOW 😳
Too little too late for this season
Josh Jacobs has almost 1500 total yards.. that’s nuts
9ers own Seahawks
4th and inches and Carr is such a cupcake they pitch it backwards as opposed to sneaking it... WOW
vegas really earned that one
So happy for a kid like Josh. From a kid that was homeless to playing in the league
The run at 5:50 was disgusting, so glad I got Josh Jacobs on my fantasy team this year, 48 points for me bc of him😂😁💪😤
with this win atm the entire NFC east is in the playoffs
Hahaha #seahawksnotmakingplayoffs
Fire the refs
Stop playing with that man 🤣
2:45 very unlike Geno, he completely neglects his check down which probably would’ve been a TD.
Im a Chief’s fan but go Raiders that was impressive.
Seattle Seahawks l😂
Raiders blanked on they ass!!!!....Way to Goooo!!!
Walker and Jacobs are so much fun to watch
This game felt electric
Whether it be winning or losing week after week, the Raiders will never cease to amaze me...
Bo jackson 1987 November 30 221 rush yards in Seattle… today November 28 josh Jacob’s 226 rush yards in Seattle 😉
The Seahawks all but handed it to them, 3 turnovers...can't win like that, Jacobs is the offensive backfield in this one,  congrats raiders
Congratulations Raiders you successfully ruined your tank by winning to a off brand Chef Russ QB
Jacobs needs his money. NOW. Matter of fact, take a chunk of it from Waller's extension. He doesn't need it
Raiders need to pay Jacob’s his money he’s a beast this season
Come on sea hawks are you joking???? You lost to the Raiders after a Bye week?? Defense didn’t decide to show up
That dude at end zone @13:30 got taken out.
W🏴‍☠️☠️
A little 40 point game was amazing
:(
Just Win baby
Hell of a win my team! Hey luv all my Raiders fans good and bad! We won!
Overtime rules are not fair
1000 comment
Yeah Raiders, ❗️  made my day 😁
Turn them loose! Mc Dummy Let Carr light it up! Fires up the whole team!
😂😂😂 Seahawks wtf happen
13:29  he dead
Superbowl?
Where is that funny whiner guy NorbCAM 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
As a lifelong 49ers fan I'd just like to thank the AFC West for doing everything right this weekend. For a while there I thought the Raiders were going to let me down, but nope - everything just as planned! :D
Crosby is a beast!
Now if only get Chandler Jones gets going....but Crosby is having a monster season.
Gruden’s picks/trades all making big impact Kolton Miller, Andre James, Foster Moreau, Josh J, Perryman, MAXX CROSBY!, even Ferrell was hitting Smith, AJ Cole, Daniel Carlson,
I just can't get enough of that cowbell! Hand him the rock! Really though-- the Raiders' offense, for the most part and short yardage playcalling aside, was a thing of beauty!
wait how is that the loudest stadium I hear more cheering from visiting Raiders with that Jacob run than Seattle fans???
Thats a heck of a way to lose from the Seahawks perspective To me, they just choked. I like em but when you play a bad team this time of year at home, ya gotta win those ones!
From a 49ers fan:  Thank you for this game, Las Vegas!
👁👄👁….RAIDER NATION!!!!
Rigged asf that was definitely a fumble
A man possessed, and the best RB / WR duo in the league  28 / 17
Have Jacobs on my fantasy team, still lost. That’s how my year in fantasy has been.
Talk about offensive balance: 293 passing, 283 rushing. If someone told me before the game Raiders would outrush Sea by 218 yards, turnover ratio would be even, I would think Raiders destroy them. Still, road win over a good team in a tough place to play with a great 12th man. I'll take it. Has to be the signature win so far.
Go Raiders!
You know Seattle was on a roll until the NFL made them go to Germany where they caught jet lag and broke there momentum ?
Just Win Baby!
RAIIIDERSSSSSS 😤🏴‍☠️
This is why I love football!! Raider Nation 4L
After that first pick by carr I was like “here we go another L…” boy!!!! Pay JACOBS PAY CROSBY
We need to pay #28 right NOW!!!!!
The Seahawks should have won that game
Jacob’s pay that man!
Our RAIDERS played great today
Josh Jacobs with the game-winning touchdown in overtime!
Raider Fan In The House:"Alright Raiders Good Come Back Way To Go, and Hey Seahawks Yall Really Played Awesome Too Plus Yall Had Us Scared, Great Game Please Continue To Keep Yall Heads Up At All Times Best Believe Yall Still Have A Better Record In The Season Much Love and Respect."
Thank you Raiders, 9er fan.
In an alternate universe, this game could have been the Super Bowl match-up. Amazing effort from both teams and what a great game!
This game was explosive
303 Total yards for Jacobs. That is just WOW!!! RB1
I'm not a fan really of either of these teams, but man, I'm happy Jacobs got to whack that final nail in the coffin at the end because he was absolutely the top performer on this field.
DK Metcalf had an amazing diving catch. The refs called it off, he clearly maintained possession. Terrible call.
😳 no way
https://youtu.be/sxP_Clzj0xk REACCIÓN EN ESPAÑOL A LAS MEJORES JUGADAS 🔥🏈
Josh jacobs is so disrespected, he’s been one of the best backs on the league for awhile now
we lost to the raiders... wtf. seahawks interception  the ball twice..
Im not even a fan of either team but I like Walker III and Jacobs. Both great RBs.
Thank god. Cant stand the seacocks
😆
That flea flicker TD was just lack of effort from Seahawks D
That flying roundhouse was hilarious
Any time the Seahags lose is a good day for America.
Could anyone else not watch the end of the game on cbs?
Koookiiee..!! just win baby..!!
Josh Jacobs and the Raiders have a lot of potential not sure why there not doing better love the Raider Nation !!!
man this Jacob is insane
If only we played like this all year! Great win Raiders! Raider Nation 4 life!
Dudes be running into people and don’t help them up
As a Niner fan this makes me so happy ❤❤❤❤
The thumbnail should have said "Jacobs beats the Seahawks!"
Tasty-Licious!!!!
Since Josh Jacob's is the best Raider on the team .... Zeigler & boy wonder will trade him ....
The Raiders just crushed any hopes and even momentum for the season.  I honestly don't see them redeeming themselves this year.  It's a wrap. However the Raiders offense is much better their defense.  M.V.P goes to J. JACOBS no doubt.
13:30 Bruh Foster laid that dude OUT lol
Crosby the real reason for this win let’s go raiders
Carr finally has a three touchdown game. Jacobs was amazing. Why do you call a toss play when you need a couple of inches.
303 total yard like come on like that’s insane for one player we just couldn’t adjust to the run and josh ran all over us smfh
Honorable mention to Geno. Good game Vet.! (Love a comeback career)
Josh jacobs  a clown for the finger ifter that TD
lol raiders!
Really? *Really?* *REALLY?*  F with the Seahawks.
great solid team effort,this is the team i thought we were getting this season,and folks thought this team was tanking,smh?we got to tighten up on defense but when it counted they made crucial stops.
Thank you Raiders! The 49ers are now in first!!
PAY JACOB'S!!!!$$$$$$$$
Seahawks are overrated.
This game was the best game that was on today! So many ups and downs, turnovers, plays made, and in the end, a simple up the gut run play in overtime resulted in a walk off victory again by the raiders in OT.  Raiders keep this same playmaking om offense(not the interceptions) and the defense keeps getting turnovers when it counts, they could go on a run. Every game is a playoff elimination game...   Can they defy the odds and go 10-7 or 9-8 and get the wildcard .....? We will see!  Can't wait for wallet and renfrow as well as Nate Hobbs to be back fully healthy and balling out. Need to see the unstoppable 3 of Adams, waller and renfrow play ! 2 more weeks! Hobbs returns next week!
LoL 😂 hawks are terrible
Fun facts: Jacobs set the Raiders all time rushing yards per game record with 229, and tied OJ Simpson for 38th best all purpose yrds single game, which is the 4th best in Raiders history. He also now leads the NFL in rushing yards Derek Carr is now 38th on the all time passing yardage list. There are only 8 active players with more yards.
Jesus Seattle!
Carr just throws into coverage thinkin it don't matter if the mans open or not.
I thought cuh got bruce lee kicked 😂😂😂
What a game , am I the only hawks fan that can’t stand DK ? Please trade him
Jacobs played well, but the decision on Dk's catch is borderline match fixing!
Excellent Work
No one mentioning Bill Cosby’s monster game
Yuuuuuup
Glad I got jacobs on my fantasy team, what a beast!
Real geno is coming back  Sacks and turnovers
🏴‍☠️
I will tell the people who will read my comment why I am happy. My favorite team is the raiders, and my best friend Bobby, watches football a lot. His favorite team is the Seahawks he was talking so much smack about my team loosing but then he saw our schedule and he saw that we played each other, so today I am gonna brag in his face tomorrow at school lol
Of course they wouldn't put that 4th quarter Jacob's fumble that got reversed in the highlights. NFL is rigged these days- not much different than watching WWE. 😠
Raiders better extend that contract on Josh Jacobs.
The best game of the season so far…I love that last home run walk-off TD run
Las Vegas better not think about even trading or letting Josh Jacobs go!! He’s are best player right now and we’ve always had good running backs, Carr is not that guy to lead the team anymore as it seems!
J cup is Bad.for a moment there  Raiders fans forgot  how terrible they are. Not an easy win but exciting game.play like that maybe they can spoil a team to the playoffs.
I had josh Jacobs for fantasy 😊
This has to be one of the greatest games in history...both teams played great on both sides of the ball...
3 picks! 🤦🏾‍♂️ still not the guy!
Didn't throw enough to DK
11:33 why on 4th down would u pitch it 6yrds back when u only have inches to go to make the first down, makes no sense, horrible play call!!
303 total yds and 48 fantasy pts way to freaking go Josh Jacobs!
Hell ya !
Thanks for beating the gaycocks i love seeing then loose!!!!
Josh Jacobs Jingleheimer Schmidt.
Lock Jacobs up and pay him anything he wants. If they let him walk or trade him I’m done with the Raiders.
3:50 is just pure football and DK being swole
Jacobs this game is the definition of carrying.
Yall need WILSON
Did either team really want to win?
Fun game to watch. Also hilarious watching reality hit Seattle in the face. That one handed catch by Adams on the sideline had to be top 10 of the year. Defender holding one of his arms, no flag and he still snares it. That’s what’s called a Davante Adams catch. How many other receivers in the league pull that in? I digress, I go by the Texas Rangers standard… if you’re going to suck, at least be good offensively so you’re still fun to watch. Like the old AFC West rivalries where even the non playoff teams would still make the divisional games have an average final score of like 35-38 or 33-34 or 43-40 or something like that? I get reminiscent of the old AFC West days back in the ‘80s and 90’s with Berman And Jackson not being reduced to ESPN+ with the classic NFL music playing while they analyze the replay on NFL Prime Time
Jacobs tryna get him a bag
Let's go raiders Crosby and Jacobs are on 🔥🔥🔥 this season
This is a game the Hawks should have won. It ended up being which team was more desperate for the win. Apparently it was the Raiders.
Hawks just took a giant step backwards
Great win! Josh Jacobs is the definition of a football player!!!
I love the mock flying motion number 10 does following Jacobs into the end zone! 🤣🤣 Also The look on the one Seattle fan with the sunglasses right after that Td? 😆 I think he was praying for a flag in disbelief in that,that happened 😳😆 Not a Raiders fan at all but my buddy is so I kind of pay attention to them & root for them sometimes lol I do love Jacobs and Davante Adams! ❤
The Autumn Wind 🏴‍☠️☠️
What a game!!
Bo’s run was remade in it’s an annaversity
Hell yeah Jacobs biggest play of the game just win baby
Yup all fun and games till the Raiders go up against the Cowboys Defense... We will see then what happens
Seahawks have officially come back down to earth after a 6-3 start and are back to being mid, just as I expected them to be this season. They can still make a run for the wildcard, but they needed this win if they wanted to keep pace with San Francisco for the NFC West title.   Good game Las Vegas.
Announcer: *sees Raiders make a close catch for an INT* “definitely not a catch”  Also the Announcer: *sees DK bobble a close catch just like the Raiders* “Oh! That’s definitely a catch!”
RAAAAAIIIIIDDDEEEERRRRSSS
That fan face near the end of the highlights lmao 🤣
Big W for the Raiders letsss gooooo
It's hilarious how you don't see comments from seahawks fans 🤣 but you see then on bronco highlights 🤣!
I’m depressed
Josh Jacob needs to get paid
The rauders fukn won smh
It's goin to be awesome seeing Jacobs in a better franchise!
Gotta love it when the Seachickens go down. Love hearing the annoying 12’s cry in their latte’s. Boo hoo.
up the GUTT! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🏾Thank you lil brothers from the Bay😉
Geno looking like Geno 😂
Seahawks what the heck losing to a 3-7 team you guys sucks
Best game I've seen in years, incredible plays, one after the other. Carr looks fantastic, Geno as well. Watching NFL since 1965, not many exciting games, this was one of the best.
Hahaha
Thank you God! God bless J. Jacobs!!! Wooooo... Raiders Nation!!! RN4L ☠️🖤
Josh Jacobs joined an elite club with 229 yards rushing. 200 yards rushing is a rare feat and should be talked about more
14:20 missed horse collar when geno was sacked
Ass head Patricia & Lame Ass Quinn,  just gave away an All Pro safety in Diggs 🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂
Damn good game raider nation 🦾💯
What a game from Josh Jacobs!!! Even with his long OT game winning run aside. Made huge plays both on the ground, and as a receiver. & has Josh McDaniels heard of a QB Sneak..?🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ And I don't think the NFL knows what constitutes a catch at this point?! Seattle has room to feel done wrong it that regard. But they can't be mad. A similar ruling took away Geno's redzone INT earlier... Good win for the Raiders!
RIP the guy getting wrecked at 13:30
15:33 Seahawks - "We'll put 9 in the box and Jacobs won't be going anywhere." Jacobs: "Hold my Gatorade."
where the hell has this raiders team been this year ?
As great of a game as Jacobs had this video did not show it...
I guess we’re still trying to make the playoffs 😅😅
Seattle really screwed themselves
49er fans rooting for the Raiders in this game.
Good job las Vegas raiders 😄😄😄 beat Seahawks 😂
Be great if the Seahawks played defense. Like ever.
Lifelong chargers fan 😂glad raiders put a beat down on Seahawks on last run by JJ…chargers couldn’t beat Seahawks at least raiders can….😂
Josh Jacob's  "Thug Live" Just Win Baby Just Win
Back to back Wins !   Stop the Press, Raiders are on a WINNING  STREAK!  Raiders looked absolutely  awesome ! This game had everything.  Ya, Carr threw a few interceptions,  but so didnt Seattle .  Raiders put up 40 points !  Wow !  What a turnaround  !  Raiders are firing on all Cylinders  !  This Win should be the talk of the town !  What an exciting  game. To see everyone  on the Raiders team stepped up, and I mean everybody,  Offense,  Defense  And everyone  in between.  Mark Davis can sit back and tell Everyone,  I told you  so, Rome wasnt built in  a day and the patience  is paying off,  2 Wins in a Row !  Huge Win for Raiders  ! And the way they won, this was a hard fought battle. I felt like I was watching a Playoff game.   You can see the difference in the Raiders, there confidence is through  the roof right now, they  Fear no one !   Watch out Everyone,  Raiders   are back in the drivers seat !   HUGE WIN !  AWESOME  WIN !
Jacob's is a STUD
12:39 Adams tired of the Jacobs-Crosby show, gets himself on the highlight reel.
WOW... What a day for Jacobs!!!
Worst tackling game ever? Other then that, fun to watch.
5:51 GET!!! OFF!! OF!! ME!!  What a stiff-arm!
Josh Jacobs with that last run was savage
WTF was that gang sign Jacob threw when he scored?
Always been A big Ameer Abdullah fan
8:19 doesn't get any better than this. Walker definitely has a solid reverse gear!
Love RAIDERS!!!
Im so embarrassed by the Seahawks defense 🤦🏻
Raiders needed this W.
The raiders haven’t done much or anything at all in decades, let them have this win 😊
Best play of the year with Jacobs ?
Jacobs was EATIN today!!🏅
Another McDaniels genius move. Not picking up J.J.’s 5th yr. Option.. Love Jacobs He don’t quit
Good game team , nice win just win baby go Raidersssssss DC4,JJ28,DA17  great team effort!💯🏈
Josh Jacobs 🔥🔥
josh jacobs gave me a heart attack and now I'm currently meditating - seahawks fan
Niners fans, rejoice!!!
what a good game, raiders have a future.
Refs sold so hard at the end. Disappointing way to let a fun game end
Beating up on giants r matey
What a game❤
Metcalf caught it. So hard to watch the NFL nowadays
2from Jacobs ,Adams,waller, etc
That first interception looked like he didn't control it and ball touched ground.  hit the ground . Then the interception in the end zone overturned because it wasn't under control. I'm half asleep though so...  also Jacob's is a beast.
Thanks you raiders for beating the sea chickens!
Raaaaaaiiiiders! 🫡😂
josh is da man looking like number 32 in 1984
Rn4lmf
RAIDERS TEARIN IT UP!
Raiders fan be like "yes we won! No wait, that's bad. We're suppose to lose! We have to get McDaniels fired"
Awesome game
Love the jack-ass, crowd-watching goons getting rolled up after a touchdown.  Serves em right.
102 decibels to 25…
At 8:32 my man touching some tts to celebrate that TD
This team should beat the Chargers, Rams and Steelers. Patriots are a tough call. That is 8-7 with the niners and Chiefs. Maybe the Chief's have nothing to gain in the last game and bench their starters.
Finally 40 pts I think we got 50 on the field Since 2-20 5yrs ago beat every team a sn champ and finally got 40 and a stop
Questionable play call from Raiders coach .
Seahawks...TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!🗑 🚮 🗑 🚮
Niners vs Dolphins gonna be a classic next week 🤷🏾‍♂️
To me that’s typical Pete Carroll and Seahawks poor football that’s why they loose most of the time just average time nothing else
Mad Maxx and JJ won that game for us.
Glad the Raiders handled the Seahawks
😎💪👌
Raiders have turned the corner!!!!!!!
Damn that dude that got knocked down after the touchdown 😮‍💨😮‍💨
@raiders pay Josh Jacobs
I bet you when carr threw that 1st int all the haters were talking crap bout him!!!! Dc4 till the world 🌎 blows
u bet, wut an incredible game, certain plays can determine the outcome, go figure?
JOSH JACOBS!!!💯💥💥💥💥👈
*THE PRESEASON MADE THESE GUYS THINK THEY WAS INVINCIBLE* Next Season Let's PLEASE 🙏🏿 PLEASE GET A BETTER DEFENSIVE COACH...
So basically Seahawks lost to Josh Jacobs today
God damn walker is shifty
What a Shootout ! Congrats Raiders 👍
What happened on Seahawks last possession when it looked like he caught the ball and ran for a first down?  How did Raiders have the ball on the next down. even if that was incomplete it was still 4th down for Seahawks.
All these flaw ass raiders fans back on carrs,and Jacob's nuts GTFOH
That stiff arm at 5:56
DK absolutely leveled that guy at 3:50
About fuccin time dam my raiders suck
Wtf was the seattle defense doing. Its like watching a jv football team learn how to tackle wtf
GREAT win today, raider nation 🏴‍☠️
That was a good game. Seahawks definitely did not deserve to win with a performance like that. During the Russell Wilson years, as a team we would always play down to the percieved level of our opponent. I feel like we're going back in that direction these last 2 games.
Can’t WAIT for the raiders to dump sorry ass broke down Carr.
13 :32  Raiders Td and Moreau knocks dude in suit flat on his arse.  Pause and repeat. Excellent .
Just Win Baby let's go RAIDERS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🍻🍻🍻
defense and kenneth walker sold our game bro
walker is rookie of the year 100%
Go Niners!
Not a seattle fan but yet another bad call alters the game....Metcalf caught that ball and the refs are ruining the league integrity....
As a 49er fan, I want to say way to go Raiders. Nice win. You picked the perfect time to play your best game.
I'm not a Raiders fan but anytime the squirrel loses is OK with me.
Seattle need bobby Wagner and a qb
Yeah Raiders!! Any defeat of the dreaded Sea-Chickens is marvelous!! There despicable coach screwed the USC program and ran; lost Heisman and National Championship. A perfect creep.
Derek Carr is not the answer...
As a Broncos fan I’m glad the raiders won
New Raiders rushing record! Surpassed Napoleon Kaufmans 227 against Denver in 1997.
Who gets paid to edit these games?  I hope it's a volunteer gig or at least mininum wage.
LV
NFL needs to fire their editor!
Jordan Brooks might be a little overrated. Has he been playing with an injury ?
Fortunately the Raiders won… 4th and inches - and you run a sweep?? WTH…
Jacobs! Crosby! Adams! Nuff Said!
Jacobs was EATING 💯
I am SUPER FUC__Ģ MAD 😠 😡 😤 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
Commander fan just coming to say thank you to the Raiders ☠️💯
Soooooooooo........  .....no one is going to talk about his middle finger after that game winning touchdown 😭
JJ#28 MADD MAXX#98,DC#4
That was the game of the week by far. Let's go Raiders baby.
OMG Jacobs with the stiff arm on the D-lineman 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼
Sad day for Geno and the offense  Most teams win if they score 30+  But the defense gave up 40😮‍💨
Thank you Raiders - a 49ers fan
13:52 Back-to-back clip. I've seen this again and again and again and again and again. Who the hell is an editor in the NFL?
@ 5:13, on that flea-flicker, Mack Hollins had barely reached the 20 and Davante Adams already had his hand up saying TOUCHDOWN!!! All while staring at the crowd. Very cool.
At least with this loss the raiders moved behind the Seahawks in draft order
As a Commanders/Skins fan, thank you Raiders for the help!
Jacobs has to be player of the week. The man deserves it
Seattle's defense sucks. And Geno Smith has no protection. Vegas had to win this game.
Can really blame the Seattle offense for this u can't let up 40 and expect to win
15:40 for all you Seattle fans.
Jacob is on another lvl
Lol at the raiders waving bye to the Seahawks fans like adams did against the broncos. Good game though just win baby
13:29 your welcome
6 more games to win 😅!! ☠️
One video would be fine I don't need to watch 12 videos to watch the whole game
wow.. What an ending! Congrats! Raiders! Hope this keeps going!
JACOBS is our savior!
"Seattle fans, 10 years ago (n.bowman's leg break) you were making fun of old memories that don't mean nothing today. How do you feel now ?? Thanks raiders 😅, wsup goose" - 9ER LIFER no bang bang bang-wagoner bs !!
One handed by tae
Josh Jacobs now leading the league in rushing! RAIDERS!
Seahawks defense playing like trash again plus the offense can’t make plays when they need to. They’re gonna get lucky if they make it to the playoffs. One and done.
How about those Raiders
Thank you for going dumb this week once again Jacobs you gave my fantasy team the dub this week and are keeping me alive 😭😂
🗣RAAAAIDERS 🔥🔥🔥
Commanders fan here to THANK YOU Raiders!!
Ok Seahawks next year draft i hope you hit jackpot like in the 2022 but possibly go all defense cuz can't stop the run and rush the Qb
Jacobs has been in beast mode all season
As a 49ers fan happy that the raiders beat the Seahawks which means we faithful nation are in 1st place in the NFC west!!!!!! Let’s go 49ers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jacobs should of ran it into to the tunnel …. Bo Jackson style 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Painful
I said it last week, I'll say it again... RAIDERNATION 💪
Oh Seattle....Dang it! I hate losing to the Raiders.
Maybe now all those faux fans calling for the heads of the coach, Carr, even Davis because we lost very, very close games early in the season will have a seat and STFU.
Please pay that man!
Hopefull raiders continue dominating performances if the want any chance of playoffs
Of all things, I am most happy for Derek Carr. BTW, I'm a Dolphins fan who had to go thru this with Tua the last two seasons.
Raiders one score curse lost is over.  2 in a row.
Great job raiders. Defense held up  finally. It was the such an even balanced offensive attack for silver and black. More of this!!!
Josh Jacobs best game of all time 220+ RUSHING YARDS WHAT A GOD
Bo Jackson would be proud!!!
Wow! What a play to end the game!!
Jacobs bringing bo Jackson memories to Seattle fans 😂😂 touchdddddddownnnnnn Raidersssssss!!!
JOSH JACOBS IS THE TRUTH!
Man,to see the line open up and all you see is end zone?amazing for jacobs at the end,unbelievable!!
Come to watch jacobs 200+rushing but leave it to nfl to show a boring ass highlight reel.
MVP Josh jacobs
1:34 What the heck was that? Bruce Lee? 😂😂🤣
Raiiiiiiiiiiders!!!!!
Game of the week so far!
Jacobs was stupid at the end.  He celebrated before crossing the finish line.  Lucky and stupid.  Fine players for celebrating early.
Feels good to win!!!!!! 🍻💪🏽
Reminds me of the old school Oakland Raiders" just win baby"!
That’s Adams catch 🔥
Seahawks line play was so bad these last 2 weeks. These rookies have really taken a step back after making such a statement early on
Nahh this game was ruined by officials
No one wants to tackle big Jacob….. he’s a beast
YEAH baby YEAH!!!!!!,..........BOOM
Rip that guy that fell from that raiders TD
Great job raiders 👏👏👏
Any given Sunday...
I'll save you some time, Raiders won!
*GG, Seahawks…* *When Y’All scored that TD, I thought, WE WERE DOOMED.* *But, we FOUGHT, and CLAWED, and BROUGHT OUR WAY BACK, UNTIL JACOBS FINALLY BROKE OUT A GOOD ONE…* *Don’t worry, Seahawks Fans…* *YOU’RE TEAM DOESN’T SUCK.* *YOU CAN STILL WIN YOUR DIVISION, US ON THE OTHER HAND, WE’D BE LUCKY IF WE MADE A WILD CARD…* GG.
Went hammer. 48 fantasy pts
Good weekend of football for me! Wolverines and Raiders winning big time!
I’m maddd as fucc
I'm so pissed I turned it off... At least we won
🙌
Go Raiders
we won in spite of mcdaniels
Pay that man Jacobs 🏴‍☠️
This is the raiders I’m use to watching. Pulling off close tight nail bitters
Say what you want to say about Josh Jacobs but when he is healthy he is a BEAST! Been a fan since he came out of College 🔥
Just win baby 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍
JJ is the MAN
All this just to miss the playoffs must be nice to be a raiders fan we’ll be back go hawks
Props to Seattle for playing a good brand of football. Probably a playoff team. GREAT WIN FOR THE RAIDERS!
This was a whole team effort 👏 🙌 GREAT WIN RAIDER NATION 👏 👍
RAIDERS!
Awful Run Defense and a costly Fumble in the red zone. Still love my Hawks though. Not a good starting point for the 2nd half of the season. Seahawks will bounce back.
Jacob’s only struggle is terrible blocking…I hope they resign him
My reaction as well 15:55 🕶️😮
nfl spoiling the entire match lol
Wow! Josh Jacobs is an absolute *stud!*
Yessir Jacobs! Thank you for that 86yard TD for the fantasy win!
Raaaaiiiderrrrsssss
Ohh my Lord jesus!!!! This is by far their best game yet!!! I was having heart palpitations and sweating like crazy bout to pass out!!! My Raiders made me proud AF!!!! JUST WIN BABY!!!!🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
Did really care who one, but the referees  didn’t want Seattle to win that game. Saw a fumble and then a over turned catch, what joke
No improvement after Bye week 👎❌
This was crazy
Our defense is awful
hawks should not have lost that game. thanks tefs
Metcalf is like a brick wall
14:06 Perfect Catch and Control. 👍 Terrible Call ! 👎
I'm happy for Carr he a good QB
Who Dat till I fry 👌✊✊ 💘
Josh Jacobs got me 60pts in my Fantasy League. Bless that man!
We still need more from Chandler jones but Jacobs is him.
Not a Raiders fan but amazing win Raiders!
Jacobs is playing madden irl
A moment of silence for the opposition this week in fantasy. He was just Jacob’d.
Everybody is talking about Jacobs and rightfully so but let’s not forget about Crosby. His sack with under two minutes left in the 4th quarter which forced the game into overtime and then that QB Hit that gave the Raiders offense a second chance in OT.
A much-needed win for the Raiders.
Great game!!
There was more raiders fans in the stadium than Seahawks fans haha "12"
Bro jacobs definitely fumbled that, and that was a catch from dk, he had it perfectly in his hands horizontally
Pay the man pay Josh Jacobs without him we would have no offense this year so I say again pay the man
Give JJ a contract for the love of Gawd
That 1st interception? Wow, alligator arms Raiders
48 fantasy points from Jacobs, dude's a monster
🗣️ Let's Go Raiders 🎶🎵 Let's Go!!!!!🎶🎵🎶🎵
Raiders for life 🙏
Biggest win of the season. 6 more wins in a row for the wild card Playoffs berth.
This whole season was supposed to be trash I'm not letting a couple wins against decent teams over hype me Seahawks are going to go 8-9 or 9-8 and that's a win based on expectations
Overtime was beautiful
Guys even if you don’t like the raiders u gotta admit jacobs is a good running back
Amazing 😄!! Kabooom! Jacobs should of ran into the tunnel!RN4L
#1 rushing yard leader, JJ28
Pay Josh Jacobs please
Good looking out by the Raiders for my 9ers 😂
40 34 ass
RAIDER NATION 💯🏈
Sorry Marcus Allen but Josh Jacobs is my new all-time favourite Raider.
40 34 ass
Raiders gifted a win from refs. Merry Christmas 🎄
Seattle's defense is a joke last two games. May be the worst in the NFL now.
Seahawks defense ruining Geno Smiths legendary season. That's 4 games now the defense has completely given up.
That made me as happy as winning a Super Bowl especially since I live up here by Seattle
Let's not forget, Jacobs fumbled that.
Jacobs!! 🔥🔥💪💪🔥🔥
Go Raiders 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤
Wooo hooo 🎉 Emotions 😢😊 Let’s gooooooooo !!!!!!  RN4L
This game sucked because the raiders cheated the whole game
I didn't notice 93 on the Seahawks flexing after the 86 yd Raider run in OT.
Keep it rolling! One at the time! Josh deserves! Don't miss him! Show him loyalty!
GO JACOBS...MAD RESPECT
Crosby and Jacobs!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have walker and Jacob's on my starting lineup. Guys have carried me all year
It’s simple really 😈
Cut the safety who dove for Jacob's, but is as slow as a offensive gaurd
Nice game raiders nation 🎉
As a Raiders fan I didn’t expect this game to turnout the way it did. They need to re-sign Josh Jacobs immediately. It’s hard to win in Seattle but I’m very happy that they did. On to the Chargers next week #RaiderNation 🏁🏳️🏴🤍🖤⚪️⚫️🏴‍☠️☠️
What a great rollercoaster of a game. Jacobs was ridiculous.
Speechless in Seattle!!!
@NFL Please put 8 NFC games at 1:00 and 8 AFC games at 4:25 for the last week of football and then switch every year
THATS WHATS UP MY RAIDERS..FINALLY YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING LIKE WERE SUPPOSE TOO WOOHOOOOO
Love seeing all the cry baby seac0cks fans on twitter claiming the refs were on the raiders side 😂😂😂. No team in the NFL is more hated by the refs and the NFL than the Raiders. Cry harder
Good run by Josh Jacobs! Thank you Raiders from a 49ers fan 😁
Chargers fan, here. You won. We won. Brady lost. Next Sunday will be VERY interesting, to say the least.
Sea chicken fans thought they had this one in the bag after the Carr Interception..
Hey, Tres, Good to see you, This your Crazy
"Go Raiders"!
Josh Jacobs is that deal  Pay the beast  RN4L  #FEEDJOSH  #RaiderNation
Josh jacobs career record ☠️
2:27 love the no-call on that obvious block in the back on Maxx
Definitely the biggest win for the Las Vegas raiders this season I did not expect them to win Josh Jacobs give him credit because that 86 yard run was insane just insane the Seahawks defense was atrocious
Can you say  GIVE HIM THE BAG!💰💰💰
Jacobs ran all over the Seahawks defense today. 229 on the ground. That 86 yard TD run was something else.
HELLA OF A GAME
Yesssss!!!!! We still alive
Outstanding game!!!
28!!
See when we spread the ball we win
Raaiiddeerrrsssss Raider Nation 4 Life 2 in A Row Baby
Back to back wins should be good for a run
Andrew Billings had a real nice game with stuffing the run and his push up the middle on passing plays, he had 1.5 sacks.
Jacobs just torched that entire D line what a beast.
Chumps won’t even make it to playoffs, let alone have a chance against my Chiefs; both these teams are getting owned come playoffs🪓🪓🪓🪓💯
Derek carr is trash yo...look how far behind he threw to Adam's cant him him in stride
The NV Patriots!
Saving me on fantasy rn
Jacobs has been the only good thing about my fantasy team all year. Dude started off slow and then went NUTS
How good is Crosby tho! Every play he’s always in the backfield breathing down the QBs neck
Bruh….this has been the worst fantasy year I’ve ever had BY FAR. I have Keenan Allen, Herbert, Mixon, Waddle, Hockenson, Pittman Jr., Zeke Eliot, and your boy JOSH JACOBS. It may not seem like a bad team but the untimely injuries and Keenan Allen specifically mixed with Herbert crushed my season. But seeing Mixon put up 56pts and now Josh Jacobs with 54pts has been badass! Drafted Jacobs in like the 6th round, definitely keeping him for next year! 😂
Yes bang Bang Niner Gang 💥
Great win baby!
Bye bye 👋 😂
I wonder if Seahawks underestimated Raiders.  Raiders run gam, pass rush and O-line were key.  As a Seahawks fan, I'm disappointed in Seahawks.  They will come back!
HOOOOOOKA👏🏽👏🏽 JOSH JACOBS YOU BEEEEASTER🔥🔥🦾
The Raiders are still sh*t and will end the season with a losing record. You can take that to the bank.
OMG. There is like 3 teams worth watching this season.
I love the look of disbelief in Sehawks fans. They are so smug. My Raiders aren't great this year but it great to see Seattle fans cry!!!!
MaXx is the SpiRit of the Team.
Seattle's defense reverting back to the way they played earlier in the season.
😂😂😂😂 Seahawks lost lol Dallas doing better then y'all LMAO 😂
What's that old saying? Oh yah.. PLAYERS MAKE PLAYS! The Raider's best players made play after play. Adams, Crosby, Carr, and last but not least Josh Jacobs Mr. 300
Pay jj please 🙏 😢 😭
Carr, Adams, Hollins, Crosby, Jacobs, Great Job
Raiders are starting to pull together right in front of the world 😎
Jacobs and Crosby are MOOOOONSTERS!!!
13:31 - I know that man hurtin😂😂
Jacobs fumbled that damn ball
As a 9ers fan I'm glad every one lost hawks, rams, cards.
I thought josh was hurt lol 😂
Seahawks fans say Russel Wilson 10 times real fast and you'll feel better. Heh Heh
Imagine if we had these raiders at the beginning of the season
Old AFC West show down.
Great road victory for the raiders against a good Seattle team, Jacobs had over 200 yards rushing and now you gotta pay this man
JJ     IS      GONE
Raiders for life 👏👏👏👏🤘🤘🤘💪💪💪💪💪💪👍👍
Told you geno is still a no name fraud
8:48 beautiful catch. GO RAIDERS 💯
Glad y'all beat them SeaDucks my 49ers looking good in 1st place
So now the Raiders have no chance to make the playoffs, they start playing like they want to win?
They better pay jacbos raiders would be stupid if they let this player just walk out....
Game started rough but glad we could finish another game! Let's go RaiderNation ☠️🏴‍☠️☠️🏴‍☠️
Thank you Raiders for the W..from a 49ers fan...
Pay him !
They act as if they won the SB 😂
Fake ass fans wanted them to tank. F tHat , Just win Baby. ❤RN4L
Let's  go Raider Nation
JACOBS MAN YOU LOVE TO SEE IT #RAIDERNATION
Jacobs was lucky that it didn't turn into a Leon Lett play at the end , holding the ball out before crossing the end zone....
The Seahawks showed they could be a possible contender this year, but this game just shut the door on their season.
Damn that was 100% a catch but seriously made the worst defense look like gods
Josh Jacobs just won me my FF matchup today with that 86 yard TD Run! Let's gooo!
The stiff arm into the Netherealm started it all.  Josh Jacobs with 303 total offensive yards on the 35th anniversary of Bo Jackson running 221 yards on the same exact team.  What a legendary performance. What a game.
Just when you thought they were done... 🤣🤣🤣 The Squad take it to the Birds 🫡 #RaiderNation
Thank you raiders lets go niners!!💪💪
When fat cow Al Wood said that was his city we started dominating immediately!! That’s Josh Jacobs town you hog!!!!
Going 3-7 to 4-7 has never looked so badass
Oline played fantastic
Gino Smith looks like Russell Wilson. It was Pete Carroll who made Wilson look good.  Look at Denver.
What a game ! Jacob's and Crosby and so much more !
Gladness Peace Good Water Many Heal Healed Loves King Work Righteousness Right Greatly Surely Lord Precious Preach Figs Beautiful
Way to go Raiders! 🏈
Playing without  Waller and Renfrow, with basicly no defense at all ...not that Bad. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Sign Jacobs to a new contract now!!!!!
Told y’all geno stink sea chicken suck y’all ain’t going anywhere with geno he suck ass hahahhah😅
Washington fan here; THANK YOU SEATTLE!!😂
Mlk
As a 49ers fan, Raiders I love you.❤
lets goooooooooo
RAiiiiiiDERS!!!!! Beautiful win!! Josh Jacobs is that F'N DUDE!!!
The retarded GM didn't pick up his fifth year option. Along with signing Jones and few other dumb things I fear there are more stupid decisions to come from this new GM.
2nd greatest game of the season! Josh Jacobs is a GOD!!
No fullback, no touchdown there. Fullback is still important
BO Jacobs! PAY 28!
74 yards receiving and 229 yards rushing.. JJ did it all.. and i know for a fact, without even looking at comments Raider fans were all over Carr for those 2 INTs in the 1st Q, but he came back and threw 3 TDS, including the clutch 4Q TD
Raiders all day baby....  But why start the game on the climb? Stop shooting yourself on the foot already
Hope you saved some money for JJ
NFL has changed so much in the last decade. It’s definitely not the same game I watched in the early 2000’s.   The game is basically unwatchable for the most part.   Every big hit is now a flag.  Every deep pass is Pass Interference.  Every QB hit is now a flag.   Every time you think the defense made a stop a phantom flag comes out of nowhere to keep drives alive.    Extra Points didn't need to be moved back from the 20.   The Kickoff Returns have been basically eliminated from the fking game? Why even have a kickoff? Kicker might hurt his leg... Chop Block is now illegal... Because a high priced player got hurt.    It’s the only sports league that changes/added multiple rules every year when it’s not needed or wanted.   Both of these are trash.
Pete Carroll's team was a feel good story until he decided to trash his former QB a few weeks ago. Wilson has fallen off a cliff, and he's rubbed teammates the wrong way for years. We get all that. But the head coach has to stay out of that stuff. Let the players scuffle, Pete has to be above that. Nope, he couldn't help himself. Never mind that he's got a sub-500 record without Wilson since he's been the HC in Seattle.
Refs rigged this one
Have Josh jacobs in fantasy
Go raiders
great game.
WOW!!!!!
RAIDERS!!!!
Seattle defense just coupdnt contain jacobs
Game of the year?
Raaaaiiiiiiiddddddeeeeeerrrrrrrsss!  #RN4L
Raiders!!!!!  Yessir 👍🏿
6 minute review of that call? F**k that, I turned the game off.
Everyone talking about josh jacobs having an amazing game and I won’t deny it he was mvp of today, but don’t forget that run to end the game wouldn’t have happened If maxx Crosby didn’t come up with the clutch stops. Good win raiders even though I am a chiefs fan lol
All the 🏈 experts Seahawks going to blow them out they coming 4rm a bye,but 4got 2 mention Raiders coming 4rm a overtime win. 🤣🤦😂🤦🤣
JJ needs paid
Yea josh jacobs fumbled and it got ruled forward progress and no whsitle was blown. Screw this dam ref staff
Jacobs the best RB
Greta Job Raiders my Raiders fan would be proud. Seahawks my friends would be disappointed. Refs my favorite team.
What a choke by seattle....u have got to get these W s at home....very very dissapointing
Jacobs put up 48 fantasy points with an injured calf. He is HIM
The Raiders are coming alive halfway through the season...with a win like this anything is possible from now till the end of the season
The Las Vegas Raiders are 4-7⚫️⚪️🏴‍☠️☠️💀 Week 13 vs Chargers
Shame on you Raiders management for not picking up #28 fifth year option. Listen to that crowd on the game winner, the nation travels deep.
Roll damn Tide Josh Jacobs:)
JaKoBz DiD ThaT..(ALL MADDEN) E A SPORTZ.. iTz iN The GaMe
Seahawks 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Jogão 🏈
Hawk got hosed on that fumble. Doesn't change that the Seahawks tackled Jacobs like he was covered in vaseline.
The Amateur-Hour Seahawks SUCK!!!!
Another tough loss for the seahawks. We were humbled and we need to tone down our aspirations of a deep playoff run until our run defense improves.
So happy for Geno!
Let’s go raiders!!!!!  I wanted us to tank but still happy every time  we win!
Should have given it to Lynch... 😢
Another OT TD winning play 2nd time in a row… beautiful plays
Sorry I meant 86 yards + anyway he got me 48 point 3 points
Nice one Raiders
Las Vegas Raiders vs Seattle Seahawks
The refs gave the Raiders the win
Let’s go Raiders 🎉
Raiders still suck
There go’s my dream of the raiders getting Will Anderson
Wax job. Skipped the Jacobs fumble, on the metcalf catch, they made sure to include the entire bite saying the football might have hit the turf, but cut short the announcer stating he thought it might be a catch.
I pray we resign JJ
This was a h#ll of a game! Old school AFC West football. Im glade Geno and Seattle are in the NFC West.
PAY JOSH JACOBS HIS MONEY !!!
303 scrimmage yards from Josh Jacobs. That's enough to know which team won the game.
Now that’s one hell of a game!
You're welcome Seattle your draft keeps getting better
Definitely not the most rigged game I've ever seen. But jeeze.. that was a fumble by Josh Jacobs which is a Seahawks W. That was totally a catch by Metcalf and sorry but you can't convince me it wasn't. Nice rig job on the headphones while you reviewed that catch for around 5 min. Should've just gone to commercial and come back to the game saying "Vegas won! You can trust us we were there". I'm sure a lot of NFL staff won big money in Vegas today 😉
No one mentioning Crosby's monster game
Game of the year
Wow😮 THATS THEM RAIDERS BABY EXCEPT THE UNEXPECTED RAIDER FOR LIFE
What a wild game. The first half had anything u could imagine. Not really a shootout but craziness leading to points it felt like. Both teams screwed up some opportunities in the second half and OT. Crosby and Jacobs are clutch and we won our last 2 games. LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS RAIDERS!
Jacob's a Beast, if we can play like this win or lose . With our hearts on our hands every game. We can go far.
Gotta give Moreau his flowers for stepping up with Waller gone. And also MAN JOSH JACOBS IS HIM. MANS NOT HUMAN🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Absolutely WILD game
49ers first place in the NFC West!!! Thanks Raiders . DISCLAIMER. I  am not responsible for ownage in a few months if the 49ers collapse and Seahawks win the division. _signed, lawyer.
Raiders Till I Die!
RAIDEEERRSSS ☠️💯🇲🇽
What a game, I regret not watching it
The Greatness.
I have Josh Jacobs on my fantasy football team and got that 88 yard touchdown
As a Raider fan, the way this game started, I did not have high expectations.
One day the Raiders will have a bad defense instead of an atrocious one. As a Raiders fan it's pathetic year after year.
Such a great game I wouldn’t have been disappointed if Vegas lost. 😮
And to think they didn't pick up his 5th year option...
Best Game !
I came here to feel the chills from seeing us JUST WINNING BABY LESS GOO!!
Wow-y, what an ending!
DC4 DC4 DC4 DC4 DC4 ❤💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾☠️☠️☠️
we got robbed!
bro josh jacobs had 300 scrimmage yards
Jacobs gave me 50 fantasy points
Let’s not forget, Crosby is a beast!!
Leagues top underrated back.  Has 1,159 yards rushing and 9 scores through 11 games Keep feeding this man!!
game of the year
That run was insane,josh jacobs went OFF this game,hope the best for him❤
Josh Jacobs is a free agent next year lol raiders not picking up his 5th year option
Damn, the Seahawks defense could not stop those running plays.
Tough one to lose
Lol...seattle just ran up their rushing yards allowed in just one play and it wasn't even in regulation. 😂
Hollins almost thought he was still an eagle when he waved his hands at the end lol
300 TOTAL YARDS, enough said.
I wasn't expecting much from my Hawks this season, not knowing how a roster full of rookies would pan out against seasoned vets, but they've had some definite highlights this year. Not today. The Raiders had an answer for Walker, they bullied Cross on the edge, and they made life difficult for the receivers. And defensively, the Hawks couldn't stop a sneeze, let alone bring down Jacobs. What a game he had! I know LV has been losing a lot of close games this season, so they better than their record indicates and they were certainly overdue to win a close one this week, but it was lackluster defense and an unimaginative offense that Seattle put out there today to compete with them. No pass rush, zone coverage on short yards, broken tackles, blown coverage deep, and huge rushing plays allowed. Again, Raiders had a great game plan and executed it, and the Seahawks couldn't get out of their own way on some of those drives. Thankfully that Denver draft pick keeps edging higher and higher up the board, so next year should be another stellar draft for Seattle. Still more season to come, but they needed this W to stay competitive with SF for the Division title. GG Las Vegas.
Damn the nfl can’t get better quality video?
LFG!!!! RAIDER NATION
Josh JACOBS IS HEEEEMM OMM BEEN HEEM BEEN UNDERATEED ! Best RB in the LEAGUE RN RN!
Awesome to see the season Jacobs is having, at the start of the year people were saying he would lose his job to zamir white by week 8
Let's go Raiders!!!!! I never lost hope during this game. Let's gooooo!!!!
UNLESS SEATTLE PRIORITIZE THE RUN, GENO SMITH IS NOT THE ANSWER!!! WE NEED TO GIVE K9 MINIMUM 25 CARRIES per game,!!! Maybe is time we tried DREW LOCK???#CMONPETE
Seattle your defense needs to step up 🙌🏽👏🏽
This game will go down as the Josh Jacobs Massacre game! Man this game will haunt Seahawks fans for years to come!
Carr needs to cried every week if they going to play like this woah
Bad loss but this does help the Seahawks draft.  The broncos pick went from a 5 to a 3rd. If  the broncos lose out and the Texans draft a qb.  This will guarantee a shot at Anderson or Carter
Don't get me wrong when I say this. The refs absolutely changed the tide of this game and changed it from a W to a loss. But that doesn't mean that Seattle didn't hand them this game. The Raiders did their job great and so did the Seahawks but you can't let the game be decided by some numb nuts. Either way, gg Raiders.
Raider fans outnumbered Seahawks fans
The Seahawks are reverting to their natural state. Disappointment
PAY JOSH JACOBS 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Both jacobs and walker did really good, especially jacobs bro ran a 86 yard td to end the game with the other 230 yards with receiving and rushing amazing game!
Nah crosby and Jacobs won us that game 🤑
Greg Gumbel  SEA on CBS
Its a good week when the seacocks lose and their annoying af fans are nowhere to be found.
yessss baby raider nationnnnnn !
As a Commanders fan,i have never been this happy to see the Raiders win since the thanksgiving game against the Cowboys.
JACOBS WITH 229 RUSHING YARDS
On the bright side, Denver lost too lol
Very happy I have Jacobs in my fantasy team lmao
JOSH FCKN JACOBS
Josh Jacobs we need you back bro
Seattle got JACOB'D! LET'S GOOOOOO #RaiderNation
Josh 300 yards
Feels bad man.
If jacobs doesn't get extended by the raiders they are idiots
PAY THAT MAN!!! 28 💰
Seattle suck off a bye and u get destroyed at home
LFG!!! 💪🏽😤 RAAAIIIDEERRSS!!! 👊🏽😎🏈🏴‍☠️
*Fun fact:* this was the first Raiders win over the Seahawks since 2010 and the first Raiders win at Seattle since 1998
360p smh nfl
why is this uploaded in 360p? this isnt 2008
WHO ELSE HAD JOSH JACOBS IN FANTASY>>> 💧 🔥
Las Ref Raiders. Las Vegas helping Las Vegas. Completely rigged league.
Adams one handed catch was wild ngl 🔥🔥🔥
I can't believe seahawks lost noo
Anyone have a compelling theory for the Seahawks being able to knock the 49ers out of first place in the NFC West Division?  At this point, I just don't see that happening.  San Francisco is on a 4-game winning streak, peaking at the right time, and believe, with good reason, they can make a run for the Super Bowl this year.  Their defense is stout, and their offense is pretty much playing lights out in this second half of the regular season.  This loss for the Seahawks was a heart breaker.
TOUCHDOWN RRRRAIDERS!!!!!
That boy needs paid!
Classic nail biter Seahawks game.
RAIDEES FOR THE WIN BABY JOSH JACOBS PAY THAT MAN
The refs totally bailed out the raiders in this game… 🤦🏼‍♂️
JJ, product of Tulsa baby!
Refs stole r win
Nice week for the 9ers
Raiders, thank you for humbling the Seachickens and their fans. We learned who they really were today. Never thought I’d be cheering for y’all, but here I am. Y’all earned it.  Sincerely,  Broncos fan
The seacocks are falling apart.
THE RAIDERS NEED TO PAY JACOBS NOW!!
What’s up with the quality
Raiders: Besiktas! Seahawks: Inter!
Josh Jacob’s 👀
crazy ending!
Back the brinks truck 🛻 up to jacobs house now Ziegler!
Thanks raiders from a Niners fan
Great game. Definitely the biggest win for the Raiders this season.
Pay Josh Jacobs!! Get a refund on Hunter
That is why you can’t punt in OT. Screw the refs, but Josh Jacobs absolutely destroyed us. 229 yards to one damn player. Our defense has regressed badly. And now Neal is hurt. I hate today.
With a performance like that, it just shows that these Seahawks are going to get stomped on by a surging San Francisco squad in Week 15.
Wow!
My man Josh Jacobs 300+ total yards. 48 fantasy pts 😂
Jo knows!! I'm old enough to remember when half of raider nation was ready to give up on JJ last year. Sorry haters you were wrong jo knows 🤴🤴
SUPER BOWL XLVIII CHAMPION SEATTLE SEAHAWKS SUFFERED THEIR HEARTBREAKING 💔 SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME LOSS TO MY CASINO 🎰 LAS VEGAS RAIDERS
Great game, go Raiders!
Josh Jacobs should be signing a contact extension in the tunnel..
Pay Jacobs
RAIDERRRRSSSS
The Seahawks are slowly coming back down to earth.
Josh Jacobs had an outer body experience!
I guess the Seahawks were still on their bye week
The raiders actually won
Smoking that Seahawks pack 💀💀
#FIREPETECARROLL
The raiders played a fantastic game
Josh Jacobs OPOY
I don’t usually say this, but thank you Raiders!
BO JACOBS 🏴‍☠️
the feel-good overachieving seahawks lose to the feel-bad underachieving Raiders  moral of the story-  overrated talent can bail out crappy coaches
I was told that Russell Wilson was holding the Seahawks back.
Josh Jacobs IS HIM! Give him his respect because ever since he’s come into the league, he’s been an absolute monster!
Seahawks are done
This is game of the year
Been had that Jacob's jersey
What a game, just 3 weeks ago, Seahawks were in contention for the superbowl by some.
Beautiful win
Josh jacobs best rb in da league
What a game good job raiders
An L and a Niners win.  Talk about a double whammy!
As a broncos fan I am very happy the raiders won thank you raiders
jacobs is the best
Seahawks D gotta improve
