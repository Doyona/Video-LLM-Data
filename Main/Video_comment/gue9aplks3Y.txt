Back to the usual pish ,wat happened to being 11 points Infront , ooops the fear happened, 10
Muito bom !!! Se continuar assim o Rangers será o Campeão !!!
This league is a Long season. Dont get carried away one bit
hagi needs time to becomes better player is too much expectation from him and this is not good for gers and hagi!
That was an impressive performance by Glasgow Rangers FC. I hope it is an exciting title race in Scotland this year.
WE ARE THE PEOPLE, RIGHT UP YA BAMS
any chance of getting some subscribers bears? rangers season ticket holder here looking to get a wee bit of dough on youtube aswell as my current job

Nobody cares

rangers on trending for the 2nd time since celtic fans have nothing better to watch
Every Saturday we follow ,we cheer the boys in blue,    the most successful team in football 1 eh Scotland’s gallant few..oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let's go Ranger's!!!
Kent is a goat in fifa and dogshit in real life
I really do wish Roofe was still with us at Leeds , if he can avoid injuries he will tear up defences in Scotland
Don't celebrate like you've win it stevie
Looks like Barisic will be one of the best buying
Why was this 2 on trending??

Poor positioning by the StJohnstone keeper for the goals.
#2 on trending uft
lol
I do actually feel SLIGHTLY sorry for Rangers... Coming 2nd all the time must be incredibly Monotonous. Every year: Close but no cigar.
Accept Jesus Christ now before it's too late brother's and sister's. When we put our faith in God's hands, he puts his peace in our hearts. Christ died for our sins, so that we could be given everlasting life in the heavenly kingdom. Amen.
I think rangers is very good playing soccer.
Muslim lives matter! East Turkistan Uigur Turks lives matter! Syrian lives matter!
I like football  This is good game
Joe Aribo is class🔥
3:26, why is he no wearing a number? lmao
Literally the 1% people who’s reading... I strongly hope your parents live longer than 100 years with awesome health thanks for reading
Why do some players dive? Answer is simple, because if you try to be honest and stay up the refs won't give you it. Until refs reward honesty and not diving this will continue.
Boli Boli Boli Boli Better than your Boli
Last time I was this early...      Celtic were still had a chance against Copenhagen
Borna is giving me Arthur Numan vibes.
Where’s the challenge that should have been a red?
Hagi needs a better team.... .. Players from Rangers don't treat him well... They have space to give him the ball but they prefer to lose the ball.. Just go from here.. To small for you!
As much as bologun has looked decent,looks like he will have serious competition with helander as he has looked good
Morelos is pish.. couldn't finish his dinner
Nothing I hate more then seeing ryan kent score smh 😐😐😑
Rangers shoulda had a penalty and that Johnstone player was lucky not to be sent off. but overall good performance just need to keep pickin up the points to stay ahead. Hope they do as a Hearts fan
Hope Roofe does well for Rangers i was gutted when we get rid of him, Good luck Roofe lad..
How can anyone moan at players diving? Refs won't give a foul unless the player falls to the floor when there's contact
Why do these never have the commentary!!!!
Nice work boys 🇬🇧
Not quite as clean a strike for the 2nd goal but otherwise it was a carbon copy of the goal v celtic in 2-1 win last year
Joe Aribo crossing himself 😬🙏
Mind the gap👀🔴⚪🔵
💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👍
LOVE TO SEE HELLANDER BACK...
HAGI do a big effort to make spaces and receive the ball but the teammates avoid to give the ball to him..Hagi is a talented player nr 10... He makes good passes and create chances to goal!
Balogun is a beast at the back and Rangers are playing excellent 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Stay tuned for the Celtic highlights at Malaga airport!
The best part of the football season is when Rangers get a couple of wins and the ‘going for 55’’ mob start coming out. They honestly never ever learn. 10 is coming lads🍀
I reckon the keeper could have done better for the 1st and 3rd goals. Rangers look good going forward but seem to switch off at the back - the keeper looks solid and will no doubt win them a fair few points this season. I'm a Hibby so could care less who wins the league, but if I had to choose I'd rather rangers won as I think celtic fans will be unbearable if they get TIAR.
Rangers looking good at the top 😁😁😁
Bornas left foot is monsteras
To all the Tim's you know were top of the league and your no,
Barisic is another level of class. Just a matter of time before we get a offer we cant refuse
Cue all the ragin Tim's 😂
Kent should learn to pass
Happened last year and the year before, and we’ll comeback and win the league again 🍀🍀
Gers fan but that would have been goal of the season by saints if he had the baws to either chip or smash it but ran out of steam😂 ..no surrender 🇬🇧🇬🇧
We have so many players we want to score for us now it's unbelievable, just still worried about the back line though 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
🇬🇧💙🇬🇧💙
Roofe will do a great job for you, wish Rangers good luck this season. (A Leeds fan of 51years)
Why dislike this if you dont like rangers dont click it
Kemar roofe?
Great game of football
I LOVE how there is no commentary for SPFL highlights.
Love Rangers 🇬🇧🇮🇳
Ceeeeedric itten😍💚💙. For ever green and white, fc-st-gallen💚
Cant wait to see Katic & Balogun in defence..  Kent & Hagi is something else!!! :D
if timmy tierney went for £25 million, Bluenose Barasic is easy £45 million hahaha FOLLOW FOLLOW
Without the hate-filled fan-generated atmosphere, Rangers will wither away into history
Can't wait till he hit top form. Onto the next.
Like, was that dude a weekend goalie or something?
After 2 seasons I feel this team now fully understand what mindset is required 9 n 3 quarters iar won’t be happening next year😂
Why is aribo so pleasing to watch
Why did hellander come on? Didn’t get to watch the game was balogun hurt or just made a sub to make a sub?
Good game of Barisic, Aribo and Kent
Let’s keep calm troops looking very solid so far though 💙
Itten should definitely have got a penalty for getting kicked. It was a stone wall penalty. Anyway, another good win, clean sheet once again, team played well, and Helander looks quicker too 👍 Another 3 points in the bag.
Hagi plays good
One things for sure......the referees are still rank! Stonewaller with itten being hacked. Good on him for getting on with it.
Not many celtic fan comments. Are they all off to Spain for a cheeky wee holiday.
Congratulations to rangers on winning the "Top of the league due to covid" cup 👍
Let's go 11 points ahead win all our games
I hope rangers win become a champion these season
Did the guy who score the 3rd just bless himself???? That will win over the rangers fans 🙈🙈
Quality, don’t want get to ahead of myself but big Balaogun at the back, Aribo looking quality in the middle and the threat of Hagi and Kent were looking a cracking force. Special mention Jon in goal he’s a sound steady dependable keeper too. We’ve yet be tested granted but looking so focused right now, not like the other mob jetting off on holiday lol
When are the Celtic highlights being released?
I really hope Steven Gerrard will get the chance to Manage Liverpool and win the Premier league as a Manager since he didn't win it as a Footballer.
We Shall Not Be Moved🇬🇧
Barisic!
Looking very comfortable without being at top form apart from the first 10-15 mins I am quite happy with the performance but definitely have room for improvement
Like If Balogun is a monster in defence
We’re looking solid already good times to come here’s to 55 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧😎
great performance looking good for aribo and many others
Top of the League and ur no
Like for rangers 💙💙
first🇬🇧🇬🇧
Yassss mon the gers
