I understand whay Klopp is doing. Testing the youngsters but these boys failed the basis of football. Giving the ball away in dangerous areas with reckless dribblings. Imagine, you're just beginning to learn how to crawl instead you were running. Beside Quensah and Elliot, others should go back to acedemy including Curtis Jones and Goalkeeper.
Good match
Nunez is so overrated
Nunez is embarrassing himself.  I dont understand his playing time vs his actual proficiency
Nunez a FLOP 🤡
I’m not a huge fan of Jota, still Salah snubbed him in his first shot on goal of this highlight… would’ve been an easy tap-in for Jota, had Salah simply passed it.   Gotta play to the player who has the best opportunity to score… or not, I guess.
DIOGO JOTA OMG
What a strange reaction from Nunez...missing an absolute sitter, apparently showing no regret or recognition of what he had (not) done. Mystifying. As if he didn't care.

7:35pm
8:12 every time man the ptsd from his corners are crazy this man hurt me and every Barca fan that day 😢
The whole highlight was basically Trent giving chances Liverpool missing 😢
Just looking back the highlights and Nunez missed so many chances first half😂
Jota may not have flare but his style of play is very interesting. He genuinely looks like he just loves to play.
Liverpool worst players from worst to best: 1- Elliot 2- Harvey Elliot 3- H Elliot 4- Curtis Jones 5- Gomez 6- Endo 7- McAllister  8- Jota  9- Nuňez
Audio sync????
Freaking awesome
Oh nuñez!😅
Nunez, put your left foot out.🤦‍♂️
Its amazing how world class strikers cant score with either foot.  Nunez has to play that with his left foot!!!!
Audio out of sync... so professional...
It is sad that mac mac got a red and the next game is vs his brother
Nunez is such a confusing player. Sometimes he's world class, and other times it looks like he's playing for Chelsea.
The MacAllister Derby did not disappoint.
8:28 Commentator reads from the script of Home Alone
Damn
Liverpool not good enough
Jota is him!!!
What a keeper, pulled off some outstanding saves.
A little bit concerning. That should have been 4-0 at least.
Honestly Diaz needs to improve new strategies by everybody is reading his game  plan
We need to get Gakpo back quickly because Nunez just isn’t good enough, I’m so sick of watching him miss sitter after sitter. Thank God for Jota. At this point Nunez should only be used as a substitute after the 75th minute when defenders are tired, maybe he can carve a role out for himself that way but he requires far too many chances for a single goal, Gakpo and Jota are way more efficient. So frustrating.
The referees were terrible this game.  You can't climb over someone's back to get a header.  This happened several times.
I love how our team from offense to defense became like a well oiled machine.
Finding 13 mins of highlights in this boring game 😴😴😴😴😴
Jota always late to the party!
Captain Chaos just makes me laugh.
So at the 13 sec mark no one notices the mistake on the line ups?
Matip looking at Konate keep the ball out and not score an own goal
Is mac allister even good at anything? Horrible passes and horrible defending
Union keeper was fantastic! Too bad they lost.  Definitely man of the match 👏👏👏
Replay
Who is this commentator?
Nunez is a youngin. Hes got time. Salah was a flop at Chelsea... With time he has become a world class player. Lets give Nunez the time that Salah wasn't awarded at Chelsea.
USG really had great no. of fans showing up.Considering they play in a tiny Stadium I didn’t think that they had a good fan base.
Managers should emphasize demanding strikers stay inside at all times or get back on site as soon as possible. Nunez could clearly see that he was behind the last defender, but did not seem to care.
Imagine lfc 2 yrs ago and look at them now why buy a bunch of players instead buy one good sticker that can finish chances Darwin is not good enough to play for lfc
elliot played very well
Brighton will bring players from this Belgium side as they’re owned by the same person
Is Mo… doing something with the hair?
nunez missed the sitters
Nuñez needs to be subbed on in order to score, he can be amazing like how he was against Newcastle if he’s benched then put in
Nunez looks the kind of player to go 9 games without scoring then put 5 away in one..
Joe Gomez was a liability in defense. Poor performance might be due to lack of confidence. He needs to improve asap.
Nuñez is the inconsistent striker
Nunez and thoughtless strikes from outside the box will be the reason for Liverpool’s lack of trophies in the upcoming future
Nunez you being very selfish you should learn how to pass the ball like Salah
jota is him man
This is biggest chance for Liverpool to get trophy of this league. As see in this league we have all lower level to Liv.
Thank you Liverpool 😅
Noneazz is a waste of 💰
#TAA #JoTa!
I was so confused for a second 10:12
Endo and simikas waste a time
i think liverpool will not go too far with this team,  unfortunately it seems true 😮
Nunez Nunez Nunez, this guy needs to meditate more often. How many times have we watch Gomez miss read the flight of the ball?
The Nunez at Benfica used to put away those kind of chances. I remember him scoring a 1v1 against Alison who many strikers to struggle to beat him on 1v1.
So Bad Nunez missed that Goal 6ft or less in Front of Goal No GK! Its Almost impossible to miss from 2 meters!
The first thing i did in eaFc24 manager mode was sell Nunez and buy latauro martinez lol
Gomez is a loss as always.
Love thw Wild Thang, but he has to start putting in the easy ones!  Go Reds!
Have to be in positions to miss chances. Come on nunez
Liverpool havent been the same since Sadio mane left
Someone get Gomez outta there
Wow Nunez reminds me of Mario Gomez for Germany…this man one day will score 3goals in 3 tries and then next week gets 10 chances and squanders them all
I thought the commentator messed up when he said Kevin Mac Callister but that’s really his name😂
Good to see Nunez back to his old self again 😅
No  Firmino, No Salah. or what
Nunez' misses are staggering. I love him. He's an incredible athlete, great football IQ. This may have been his most shocking miss yet. It looked harder to miss that than score it. It didn't even look like he was trying to put the ball in the net. It's like he freezes up in the situations where he knows he "should" score. It's gotta be between his ears. Was he this way at Benfica? I doubt it. He wouldn't have gotten the contract with Liverpool. There's no other explanation except he is folding under the pressure of a bigger league and bigger club. I keep waiting for the damn to burst where he becomes a phenom and can't stop scoring. Still waiting...may, sadly, always be waiting.
They’re wrong for that thumbnail 😭
Rather biased commentary
Darwin either scores offside goals or misses everything
It would be embarrassing if Liverpool cant manage to win the UEL.
nunez is a freaking joke.
Darwin still missing them easy chances isn’t good! Still reckon he can get a 15-20 goal season this year! 💯
They saved me 1800 by scoring last goal. And they cost me 950 On spurs.
lmaooo can’t even beat this team but more then 2goals hahaha
As a liverpool fan and having just watched the city highlights from cl, we are beyond sloppy and lack the confidence chemistry and finesse needed to really be where we need to be
Mccallister needs to look where he's passing, no blind passes man unless your 100%
Diaz can only score when he's offside! Or deemed to be so :)
That 3:31 Trent pass 😮‍💨
Nunez sucks, at least Ryan takes his chances. Nunez has such a poor decision making and low game IQ im REALLY not impressed by him. We need a killer like Salah when he is gone to Saudi Arabia.
Liverpool in Europa League ..
Handball on that second goal
My twitter feed was flooded with stories about Liverpool game today, so I was like Liverpool played today? Is there champions league now on Thursday, but then remembered they didn’t qualify for champions league, it’s Europa League 😂😂😂
Nobody is talking about Quansah, the young man is a future Liverpool star
Hora always scores
Naw that nuñes miss was blasphemous. I would’ve just walked out
Les belges ne sont réputés être des bons footballeurs.
Nunez is not at Liverpool level.
Liverpool are artists this season
Nunez is trash and will never be as good as Suarez!!
This commentator is a lil hater
Nunez is not meant for this league or this club.
The fact both Mac allister brothers teams faced off today 😂
Fantastic job cutting these highlights, showing end to end development of big plays. TY
Why did the referee blow the whistle during the corner right before Liverpool’s first goal?
Liverpool is one of the clubs that plays down to their competition
Man U fan here to recruit a new goalie!!
Gravenberch what a steal 🙏🏻
Nunez is never going to become a Liverpool great playing like this . He’s offside a lot and his finishing is inconsistent.
this is not real 1080p hd. cbs highlights are bad
Diago Jota Gotta score
3:37 I never seen a move like that🔥😮
Darwin just can’t put em in the back of the net. He does great until it’s time to finish it.
DIOGO JOTA IS HIM! WHY IS NUNEZ STARTING AT STRIKER?????
I think I like Liverpool’s Europa team more. Credit to Gilloise their keeper was 👌🏿
Good win for now. Brighton will be very tough.
리버풀감독병원에가서.징징거리는병치료하기를.뛔뛔뛔 뛔뛔뛔 뛔뛔뛔 뛔뛔
diogoal JOTa is pure class,.... the burst of accerellation the touch the finish
this is not real 1080p hd. cbs highlights suck
I will make sure Liverpool win the Europa league
"Are you a goal, cuz I keep missing you" -Nunez rizz
Goal keeper is crazy
Nunez has missed more goals than anyone I’ve seen. Wide open bangers. Guy is great with his positioning and creating opportunity but not a strong or consistent finisher at all.  Guys a head case.
Even Klopp is like WTF Nunez
commentator is a total liverpool hater
2:53 VVD smacking Szboszo in disbelief from that Nunez miss 😂
Quansah. Top talent man
Aside from the spill in the first half, USG's keeper, Moris, played well
How dare you say Nunez is off side, replay the game!
after the VAR BS vs spurs, this was a massive 3pts for the redmen.  midfield starting to gel nicely. i'm forecasting champions league next year
What a GOALKEEPER ! No wonder why his the captain ! Sucks he fumbled the ball for the first goal, he was great all game
Re upload the video audio is delayed
It would be nice if you show between halves substitutions
Nunez always scores the long shots but never the easy ones 😂
The audio delay makes this unwatchable
“And Nuñez, well…he really should have scored…” 😂😂 if only that wasn’t true ever week!
All luck for Scousers
Oh, Nunez.. The Harry Maguire of attracking players.
Is no one going to bring up the fact that Alexis McAllister's brother Kevin started for Union today??
Can’t believe Nunez missed that tap in he needs to step up now that Gakpo is injured
If Nunez misses like this, that forces Salah to be "selfish" in the future. In fact, I was surprised Salah passed the ball to Nunez and did not take the shot himself at the goal.
Goalkeepers spilled or saves should not be given as an assist to the player who taken the shot.
Huge difference between Son (World class) and Nunez (Not so WC) who can't quite finish the goal...
Nunez missing more sitters. Liverpool fans calling him chaotic and attractive and unlucky. Meanwhile, Salah would have had at least 4-5 more assists if Nunez knew how to be a proper striker. You weirdo Nunez fanclub are ever going to stop embarrassing the rest of us this season???
Jota will be the next Michael Owen . That’s a good and a bad thing 😂
Luxembourg are lucky to have a professional quality goalie
Yes, Darwin SHOULD have scored, but I see other players missing very favorable chances too, and somehow they don't get the same criticism. Liverpool should score much more often than it does, based on chances created.
Gravenberch🧡!!!!
ppl were saying nunez would have a great year off only one good game against newcastle 😂😂😂
Jotaa the slotter get in boysss
Liverpool playing at half speed, no tempo or intensity at all...
🔴❤️
Nuñez either scores bangers or misses sitters
Lord Nunez strikes again😂
nunes - squid
Nunez finishing misses too many chances 😢
This Liverpool squad wouldnt survive UCL group stage
Love these highlights but does anyone else hear a delay between the video and the audio?
