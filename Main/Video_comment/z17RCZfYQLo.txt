COYS!
Proper character with a big personality  Something the premier league is lacking rn
It is a decent squad and I am so happy for Jarrod and Justin. I wanted James Maddison as he arguably had a better season than any British midfielder  but as Southgate plays a 4-3-3 or 3-5-2 his system lacks place for a conventional no.10.  I think he can be tried in an 8 but there are a couple issues with that. One is the obvious competition in that position with Rice,Jude, Jordan, Phil, Kalvin and even James Ward-Prowse ahead of him in the queue. Secondly, it depends on how he adapts to an 8 as well. Nonetheless, he is knocking on that door consistently with quality  performances.  I am glad that  Tomori is shining in Italy. He really took his chance as Simon Kjær unfortunately tore his hamstring at the turn of the year.
Quite refreshing
He is gonna go on and be a manager
Great interviewee.
4:10 - James “We’ll do our business in the background” Maddison
True
Heard he's big-headed outside of football and likes to brag about how expensive his clothes are, and other stuff like that. Money does things to people.
🤣🤣 kid did heavy work now they 5th 🤣🤣
Video that precede unfortunate events
If we aren't trying to pick between him, Mount, Grealish and Bellingham for the midfield at the Euros then don't bother going
A great pundit in the making
Im a life long united fan and Jack grealish is my favorite player right now. But my fifa career mode is as James Maddison because I just love the way he plays the game and conducts himself as a person. (And leicester have a nice squad ngl)
Brilliant interview ! Not all players are brain dead reading from a script, great to see
I think this guy will go on to be a good manager in the future. He's articulate and talks like a manager
Looks like Wayne Rooney
TBH I always skip minutes in interviews to the part I see on the title, only this time to be in awe and total shock of James's honesty, confidence and beautiful attitude in the interview, couldn't skip one second. Regret the fact that this is the first time I hear this guy being interviewed. What a character and a great natural future pundit. He could make his own Football Youtube channel and even be a bigger Legend.
Being candid in interviews can end badly with your foot your mouth. He'll get media training soon.
Just attitude should make him get a call up
He is so busy
As a noriwch fan it's so good to see how he's developed. Top player
Norwich fans crying now we could've got another 20 mill for him
Refreshingly honest. I don't even like Leicester but somehow I'm hoping James Maddison gets the goals he's working so hard for.
Isn't he giving out too much details? I don't think Brendan Rodgers will be happy with this 🤔
Very likeable fella...no PR bullsh*t..no robotic phrases we heard 1000 times Just honesty and personality. Love to hear this in sports today!
Madders is brilliant. I hope Leicester make it two and get a second title because the Leicester team is so down to earth. Unless West Ham manage to sneak their way to the top that is.
The way he responded to the title race question was pure class you can't even dispute that
Who’s here from Thogdens video
I didn’t here one eerrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
This guy is almost as good as Håland at interviews.
Maddi looks like Grealish typa😂🙈
Grealish or Madders?
Madders is absolutely breathtaking, on and off the grass
Excellent interview one of the best I have seen from a current footballer... well done lad..  is it me or has he got a bit of an Asian twang going on with his accent lol
he speaks well. Some football players are intelligent
Credit for the reporter for actually listening to his perspective instead of trying to stir the pot. Need more interviews like this
Future pundit.I can bet £1000 on that
Great interview respect
Great interview. A footballer with a personality is nice to see 👍
If I could smell where the ball is gonna drop I’d have a fleet of super cars from b.o.t.b 😂
Damn i remember when my hair was thinning out like that. Rain and bright lights are very unforgiving.  Great player and nice that he can string a sentence together too.
Fantastic interview and a great role model for younger players
James can you help Dele we need him to be like you on and off the pitch.  Spurs fan.
over and over again i am impressed by how articulate and intelligent (at least about football) so many of these blokes are on interview....compare with the same guys playing baseball in USA who often sound like they may not be able to write their own name (harsh), but just lack the critical thinking and langauge skills. really appreciated, too, LC's guy following the new distance guidelines when celebrating, as opposed to another game the next or same day, maybe burnley, forget....
Chelsea supporter here, I love it
Very clever answers! Clever player!
Fair play to Madders I like how he conducts himself in interviews. He's got a good blend of swagger n confidence in his own ability which then makes him give off good vibes in interviews. He's not like the average baller who gives such monotone n boring interviews after the game as if they're speaking to the queen looool he's juss himself wherever he finds himself.
Great attitude and approach. Well done.
Top lad madders, speaking from the heart
Maddison putting some respect on the player Frank Lampard was. Not doing great for Chelsea in the manager seat but as he said, after just beating his team. Best at what he did.
One of the best interviews I've ever watched well done madders
Talks like a manager lol
Love this guy, he was magnificent for us (Norwich) until we sold him, and his fee saved our club,  loving that he is flourishing in the top league and he will get better, it’s what he does,   He has no limits to what he can achieve, will follow his career with interest and great pride 💛💚
This is a perfect example of why I should ALWAYS take criticism constructively
some players just know what football is about. future manager, definitely.
Excellent interview, easy to listen to, engaging, some character.
Great guy
Future Primier League football manager!
What a great interview.. articulate, honest, insightful..well done James
Very well spoken. Clear and what all football fans want, honesty...
The first minute: Had to slap myself in the head to remind me he's not the manager, the way he talks, lol (United supporter here, just casually watching, I like this guy though ^^)
Youthful, enthusiasm, well spoken.
Why is he being interviewed by Michael Caine
He'll be a manager after hes finished here
James LADDison
This man just lowkey took shots at my team😭"bringing players from abroad and paying big wages"
Maddison age 23  talking like a model pro add Tielimans 23  Ndidi 23 Justin 21 Fafana 19 and  6 players in that squad who have won the prem dont know if they can win it  but would not count them out being in the mix to the end
Such great responses
This is a refreshing interview it’s nice to see someone not saying the same cliche stuff    But at the same time he’s revealing key information which opposing teams can use
He seems very switched on.  Sounded like a manager as well.
Brilliant guy with an honest assessment of the game.
This guys very smart wow
Is it me or maddisons interview was bit strange?
Leicester are the only remaining top club not relying on big money and look where they are, they're now what Manchester United used to be and that's the truth, BTW, I'm actually a Chelsea fan, so this is a burn on my club too 🤷‍♂️
I like James maddison coz he talk with no social compliance in his voice , hes free a right average lad approach .. no public service announcement lol
James Maddison so smooth, he’s got to be a pundit after footy
More interviews will come with this lad,nice one!
He says more then most managers and more in depth than Southgate
Great interview.
that’s how to do a interview
Top guy. Wish him and Leicester the best.
Madders sounds like that smart kid in class that gets in front of assembly and is just natural and not robotic
Future football manager incoming... great stuff
Maddison speaks very well and honest.
He speaks amazingly well. Some player as well
Lovely bloke
Name a more humble, well spoken and class footballer... I'll wait.
Brilliant interview will be good manager in a few years
Great interview
What a refreshingly candid interview. Loved that. Real guy. Real talk.
Will retire Carragher from MNF
Never seen him interviewed before, what a well balanced, articulate normal down to earth guy....
Sky sports......sign him up!
Respect for this Maddison 💯
24 years old and he spoke like an actual pundit!
Real breath of fresh air!
Refreshing interview.  What a great role model.
Pundit hahaha. This lad grew up on champ man. Great player . Brendan won't appreciate him giving the team tactics away. Talks too much
Not a supporter of the club but I really like the way Leicester play their football, especially since their promotion to the EPL. Hope to see them in UCL, they certainly have what it takes to win the league again.
Madison is sounds honest guy to me and genuinely him being interviewed is something I can't wait to hear from him. Keep up the hard work mate
Everyone else saying it but it’s true - he speaks honestly and like a normal person, very few players do anymore, too much ‘media training’. He’ll get the respect back from the media and fans
Maddison could sell me air
I love this guy. Literally nothing bad about him
Seems a sound lad.
Great interview can all footballers be more like this
Thank god he is English
Madders is one cleaver guy! He actually articulates how he feels and puts his opinion forward and doesn’t stick to a script
I just want to hang out(party)with Mr Maddison. 😎
They've sold Maguire for 80M Chilwell for 45M how can they not spend big money and pay big wages
Do you hear that Frank a manger with direction and ideas motivates players
Speaks really well, is honest and makes sense. Good interviewee
Maddison is a great player, with lots of room for improvement and seems to be a nice Lad!! all the best, and you are going to be one of the best english players for sure!! Amazing Quality !! He needs to Start for England !! Southgate must be blind!!!
Madders TV pundit signed by Sky
My God saw him speak for the first time . This lad is bloody good.
Nice chap, seems like a real human with thoughts and feelings unlike other footballers
I like this interview, really honest but not sure why he mentioned spurs, with the likes of man u and liverpool
Harry Redknapp-esque 😂
If gini leaving liverpool we need to sign this guy 80mil
Doesn't he look like a skinny Rooney with hair and a bit photoshot to make Wayne look s bit btr that's wat he looks like
what a great interview
GREAT LAD!
Such a genuine lad I wonder why Southgate picks Mount ahead of him.
Such a gun interview.
He speaks beautifully about football. A natural born pundit
This is one of the most brilliant post match player interviews I've ever seen.
Gonna guide England to a European cup
Wow. He is so transparent about his thoughts. Loved this interview.
This dude has epic mic skills wtf. Should get him to answer interview questions for haaland.
Very clever guy football wise well done James Maddison
quality interview
So chilled in his interview, came across really well. Like someone else said, definitely one that'll end up a pundit in years to come
He was right, top for no time at all😍 Man United are winning it this season baby 👌❤️
you just cant hate James Maddison
Madders really got his mentality straight this season, absolute class.
Likeable guy. Great interview.
What a total credit to the team and his sport, Maddison  is such a rare breed, a hardworking talent on the field and articulate and thoughtful man when being interviewed. Gave credit to the manager, the team and also showed his humility by listening to constructive criticism from Carragher. He is an inspiration for other young players and should be applauded!  *Still want my beloved Hammers to finish above them though : )
He's one of us.
Carragher is the best. He's always right. He said that United needed one big signing to compete at top of the league again (before serial quitter Roy Kean piped up with "you didn't win the league") and they signed Fernándes. Look at them now.  Best pundit Sky have ever had.
Excellent interview! a great example for young players to keep working on their own game and working together as a team.
Great attitude this lad has.
Imagine taking advice from Jamie Carragher lost all respect for this lad.
Such a well spoken lad, a skillful baller as well 🤙🏻
After Maddison retires he should join the punditry. He looks good at it.
Probably one of the best interviews I've listened to in a long time.
Very articulate. That is one bright lad.
Comes across really well
well spoken lad.
Quite a refreshing interview, not just another media trained load of boring waffle you usually get
A rare case of a good footballer who is also a really nice and honest guy.
This is how you speak to the media, world class James!
Leicester City have two of the most intelligent and erudite players in James Maddison and James Justin.
Absolute legend - great energy, open and honest - love it
Wow, what an interview. Really honest and direct from the heart
Maddison oozes class
Maddison is quality on and off. You could see this at Norwich.  There was about 10 players at Norwich imo that i saw over the years that really stood out as extra special head, shoulders above the rest of our team from a midfield  or strikers position and he was one of them.
Good lad. Maddison is on fire at the moment plus barnes
What a great interview!
Brendan,give this man the bloody Armband
Such a good interview love that he’s actually got a personality
This is how interviews should be done with energy
Never heard him talk before. But I can hear him talking all day long. I see a sure shot Mourinho player in him.
The way he speaks makes me see him as a top manager.
He talks like Owen Hargreaves😁  I enjoyed listening to him speak
I like him. Sound lad. Give us abit of insight of how tactically Leicester played the the game. Doesn't sound like media trained robot.
Future pundit in the making
that'right! He is turue
The best interview of all time
Great future pundit
top lad
Thanks for giving away Leicester's tactics as well as mentally towards games. Haha
top lad
What does Mount do? sell that guy and give Havertz the free role he excels in
As a chelsea fan, this is very sad, so sad...Soldier Out
He is a pundit in making
Was a sad day when we sold him.
Wow the first time I've heard him being interviewed wasn't expecting that, such a well spoken lad
Future pundit this lad
Blue army 🦊🦊🦊
What a capable interviewer. Hats off to him. Jeff Shreaves could learn a thing or two from him.
absolute class this bloke
Forget the sweet talks - Lets take the bull by its horn!! Damn Straight
lovable guy
Finally someone who doesn’t sound like google translate
I really like this guy  Not a fan of English footballers nowadays apart from Vardy  But this guy is giving me Lampard vibes and he has got some style  Confident and real talk  Not stiff like harry kane .
Love that man
Seems a very intelligent & articulate man, refreshingly so.
Go on Maddison....glad your coming on after what NCfc taught you son
Top man
Honestly brilliant interview from both. Man Utd supporter. But this was a really insightful interview. Maddison will be a great manager one day I think.
He hates having to repeat a cliché. Other footballers can't speak in anything but them. Top lad
Class player!!  👏🏼
Shame that Leicester is not talked enough in the title conversation especially where they  are when it's half of the season. What an interview......
Very eloquent. Refreshingly insightful
Very eloquent. Future pundit no doubt. Sky probably offered him a contract after this.
He gave a very good interview here, James. That was interesting to listen to.
Seems like a good kid.
Nice chat. Nice guy
What range, he's banter with Grealish while playing FIFA would make you think his obnoxious.
Where's Jaime's reaction?
What an exceptional man. Soo genuine and passionate.  Good luck to him
Maddison should be in the England squad. He’s been playing all season and deserves his chance. He’s hungry for success which is what we want in the national team.
When will everybody start to consider Maddison as the best attacking midfielder in the league?! He is so underrated!
Future manager one day
Can't afford big talent from abroad, made 50 mil from chilwell and have a billionaire owner, they definitely can
Come to Liverpool mate 😭🥺🙏🏾
Seems to be a half intelligent bloke. Decent.
If hes not a future manager..top lad..newcastle fan..
Always liked this guy, would love to see him playing for Liverpool.
2:15
I really enjoyed this interview, honest and  no pr bullshit
Pundit, coach, player, fashionista aka W James Maddison....what can’t he do 😂
Someone’s happy
Great interview james 👏👏
I really like Maddisson as a character and player.I see a bit of wibes of Rooney there :).I hope United can get him to join.
Bloody ell, this bloke can talk underwater.
this guy talk sense
top bloke
Wow...such a nice guy
Superb interview
Love this from Jim
Terrific interview,  great talent and a great attitude to match.
True gent
Madders mad brilliant
Wonder how ozil would do in Brendan's team
First interview i ever listened with him hes a likeable fella hes happy just with game of ball very rare to see these days
Well played fellas
Gonna chuck a few quid on him being a manager. He gives such good interviews. Honest, articulate, direct. Glad to see an England player give an interview like this. An intelligent footballed but sounds like he wants to push himself as well. Great to watch
What a very good interview. James is a very intelligent footballer.
Take note players this is an open fresh and flowing interview. No BS cliques. Real talk Madders
An articulate footballer with rational thinking?
One of the best football interviews I’ve ever seen what a lad 👏
Hes a future manager
Why does Mount get compared to every English mid? He’s more of a deeper lying creator and controller not a CAM, some people are deluded
Class player. Should be a regular for England this year
He's a cracking wee player and will only get better. Can see him being part of the England team that rapes us at the euros 😩🤣
I reckon a lot of that was direct quotes from rogers
Pusb
Such a mature head on his shoulders. Hope he stays at Leicester for a long time.
He’s a primadona which I dont like but some football player. Coming from a Chelsea fan
Southgate is watching like: "cool interview, but I'm still picking mount"
Excellent interview 👏 I like this lad.
he is a grate lad
Best interview I've seen in ages . Honest as anything
Talks the talk and walks the walk!!!!
That’s one of best interviews from a footballer after a game I ever seen. Talked honestly and passionately. Need more of this. Rate Maddison even more after hearing him speak as you can see he’s a clever driven human being. Can only breed success
I can’t explain why, but this just made me smile. Sublimely detailed insight from a player.
Probably the most honest interview iv seen from a player and well spoken no bullshit talk just an honest lad .....we at Liverpool could do with him would be a good signing
I like this guy
Absolutely love this interview. Well done James, and good to hear Jamie's advise was actually useful for him. Beautiful.
Haaland needs to watch these interviews
Good interview 👍
Great player great interview
This was a great, refreshing interview
I think Leiciester has to be a top 6 six side now replacing either chelsea or arsenal
Great interview and I'm not a leicester fan
Future manager speaking
As a spurs fan this was enjoyable to watch 👏🏼
Class act, way ahead of Declan rice for that England shirt.
This guy is very well spoken, good at football, good looking he has it all doesnt he
Great interview.  It's honest and insightful. Respect to him and to Leicester.
What a jolly nice bloke
I really loved this interview from Maddison, honestly it’s a joy to listen to
Just like one of the lads... Fair play
i like this guy and im a villa fan he will do good for england
Finally an interview where the player talks like a human - honest, straight forward and real. Every other play I've ever heard read off the same hymn sheet like robots. Fair play to him, hopefully see him in the euros over mount. He's twice the player mount is.
He seems like the only player to be bothered with post match conferences
Madders is becoming a student of the game. There were questions about his attitude in the past but you really get a sense that he's decided to knuckle down and focus on his football. He's actually giving me future manager vibes already haha.
Top lad
talks like a pundit - Garry and Jamie watch out!!
I LOVED THIS!!!!
Actually a enjoyable interview. Never usually see players talking this openly
Yeah like james maddison said everyone talks about man u chelsea and liverpool but have any of them won championship and premier league at the same time maybe not
leicester when they play a game at night are dangerous
Legend
Larry large Maddison Top Man 💥💥💥💥
This is without a doubt the best post match interview from a player I have ever seen.
You can tell this guy eats sleeps football
Great interview, such a breath of fresh air
To cocky and arrogant for my liking
Top man 👊
Felt like some Manager was speaking and telling his plans for the match ... Awesome ...
Great interview
I support Man UTC but I really admire this lad. Good luck to him. V. Good player
Anyone else think he looks a bit like a skinnier Wayne Rooney? Something about his face/forehead just looks like Rooney.
Brilliant, brilliant interview! Honest, crisp, witty yet so, so on point. Top guy. Top team.
He is a brilliant man to talk about soccer
Great interview, but I do feel like he's a bit up his own arse.
It is an absolute pleasure to listen to the way he speaks about football, the candidness is beautiful.
Get him and Grealish in the same England setup, jobs a good'un
Great interview by maddison.
He oozes class, absolutely class player, I’d love him at United.
Just casually outs Rodgers’ tactics.
Would love to see Leicester win in again, would be unbelievable
You lot got a lucky goal on a corner vs united should be greatful!
Good interview and a very articulate speaker. Good to hear a player be so open and honest and admit where he can improve his game.
Jimmy carragher and gary neville have opened dictionary to listen thus boy now what he said😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👂👂👂👂👂
What a great professional
Top guy and a terrific footballer, wish he was at Leeds!!
Anyone else hear slight Brent undertones?
Sky can give him an offer letter for future pundit or analyst.
They should call this guy for punditry one day🖤
That "we work haaarrrd"😂
This lad talks so well and seems genuine.
Personality in abundance
He's a breath of fresh air in interviews. Open, honest and not giving the same 3 lines all the others do.
He's not just honest, he's smart and insightful too, might become a manager one day
wish he replaced jeamein jenus  on match of the day, now. cant stand him.
Nice. But he shouldn't mention other clubs. Wise
What a leader
Everton gunna slap Leicester
Unbelievable interview. 👏
Imagine if Pogba or Henderson or Kane did this exact interview word for word how many dislikes the video would have. It's good to see how much respect Maddison and Leicester get and it's deserved.
Fantastic player. 2 Good feet, Intelligent movement, Quick and industrious.
Great interview
Fair play he’s got something to say and can back up his (very high!) self confidence with talent and you can tell he works hard behind the scenes. Good on him.
What an interview. Special player!!
Would love his energy and quality at Spurs as this lad is a quality player with a winning mentality
I went to see Maddison play at Peterborough, he shone from the rest when he played . It’s crazy looking at a star before they truly shine
thanks for ruining my night James 😭
Love the fact he isn’t a media trained ediat
2:09 confession time
What a good talker, super guy.
Maddison is an intelligent and honest young man. Refreshing to see a player talk so honestly and passionately about the game.
Brilliant interview how lpool never enquired about him I don’t know, some player
Quality interview...both him and Declan rice say it how it is...👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Cant wait to have madders at AFC..🤣
Probably the best interview I've ever seen a footballer give.
I never understand why teams like United and Chelsea don’t go for this guy ... heist natural playmaker he can score goals, great at free kicks ...
What a candid interview.
James Maddison trying to secure a career as a pundit after football
I bloody love this guy
Only player that doesn’t say “errrrrr...” every third word
This guy has sense
great to listen to. very interesting! smart guy as well.
I’d love to see an Amazon doc on Leicester
Great interview. Nice to see someone with a bit about them, instead of sounding like they’re reading off an autocue.
He's probably one of the best pro-sportsman in interviews. Doesn't repeat himself and has a bit to say rather than just reading from a cliché script.
Fantastic interview. Clearly a young man who just loves to play the game
Even as a Chelsea fan I have to say I have so much respect for him and this interview, what a guy 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Can we swap Maddison for Micah Richards' punditry. He's concise, understands and gets straight to the point with regards to tactics and finishes his sentences.
Class Interview 👏
For a moment I thought he was the manager
What a dude
Not sure numbers are advice but nice interview nevertheless
wan bissaka can learn a lot from his interview skills
You simply cant hate this guy
what an absolute pleasure to listen to
James I agree with you our defence truly does go to sleep. We need to work on this.
Future Sky sports football pundit
He speaks like a manager.
Maddison will be a pundit
The adrenaline is making me speak very very very fast, said James
I normally skip interviews or just don’t watch them but he actually is interested
I imagine Sky have already written up his contract for the day after he announces his retirement
Very similar to haaland's interviews
Madders lad, come to Liverpool 😊
Nice to hear someone speaking from their heart.
if anyone asks me maddison or grealish i stick with james what a lad! my favorite midfielder in the prem probs
Top lad 👍
Future manager for sure
Well spoken man , and a top player , one for the present and the future 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Maddison, Saka, Foden, Rice, Grealish, all performing exceptionally recently. Promising signs for the England team 🤞
Good interview!
Speaks really well! Not like most of the media trained robots.
Best interview for a long time.
Came here from 433.
Tremendous interview that 👏
Coherent sentences.. what is this?
He is so well spoken.
Puts himself across really well, brilliantly spoken and honest. Top lad
james maddison and connor coady are gonna be future pundits
Must chew major ears off after a stripe Madders
As a chelsea fan can say nothing but praise for Leicester and Maddison here. Top player who speaks very well
Speaks well the guy
This is the first season in a while where ive checked the table multiple times to see whose top or in the top 6
He is on cocaine
Think he's lining up a career after he's hung his boots up! Certainly shows some of today's pundits how it should be done (Michael Owen, I'm looking at you 😂)!
Great passion, enthusiasm seems intelligent.
Top bloke. Sign him for Liverpool.
will be a top pundit
Arrogant
Maddison is a future manager alongside a future star hahahaha
How did he slip through the net, articulate,  modest, intelligent, sense of humour, respectful...... Never heard him speak before, like others thought he was arrogant......im choking on this humble pie.....quality son quality
Great interview! Real as it comes!
As a United supporter I want this guy in our team good attitude and focused I liked what he said you can’t be in the team if you don’t do the dirty work what a guy
Maddison is just great. Class act
The amount of teams that have been at the top of league shows premier league is very unpredictable this season. Villa could win all their games and become top.
He is like The Rock or maybe even me on mic
Chelsea need jack the analyst
The pr guys are having heart attacks watching this
He's clearly a bright lad, unlike almost every other young footballer haha
Looking to be a pundit when he retires by the sounds of it..............
Maddison deserves to be in the England team miles above the likes of Declan Rice and Harry Winks
Sign him up Klopp 💯👌🏻
7 teams have been top so far this season and it could be 8 today. 2nd or 3rd time Leicester have been top top. 9 points separate the top 9. What a season
Seems like he'll make a great pundit in the future, talks very well.
Thinks he’s cleverer than what he is, and waffles
What a nice lad
I don’t even know if this guy is snitching on their tactics or giving Brendan a shoutout 😂😂😂 some things are confidential ya know 😂😂😂😂😂🤣
he speaks so well
Is he related to david beckham.that face
Antonio and Maddison are the only players who can show their personality in their interviews
Wow. A footballer who seems like an actual human. Refreshing
Beautiful human being
Its the year 2035 James Maddison and Oxlaid-Chamberlain are Sky Sports Pundits Tottenham still haven't won the Premier League
What an interview that is what a mature male
A footballer show casing his individuality is massively refreshing to see / hear
Hope this guy goes right to the top he’s a serious baller without the fake personality down to earth and honest and rarely has a bad game
Grew up a Newcastle fan but still found I loved frank Lampard so much, despite the fact he was obviously a Chelsea player.  Feel like I would have looked up to Maddison in the same way if I was a kid today.
He was just so honest and said everything how it is. Absolute baller and playing very well, fair play to him.
Spoken like a true footballer. Can definitely see him in management at the top level when he retires.
on par with Haaland's interviews
best interview ive heard from a prem player
I love this guy man, loves being under the spotlight!
I run this bloke. Absolute quality.
15 YEARS FROM NOW.... MADDERS IS THE NEXT BIG THING IN PUNDITRY
Great interview
I could feel the positive energy from him over the screen . Ok see u later I am doing push ups now 😂
Maddison is the only interview worth watching I swear, dude isn't afraid to talk
People saying he sounds like a pundit but he talks more like he is the manager.
What ever Rodgers know we comes from Jose mourinhio that’s y he is a success
Imagine haaland and madisson had an interview together
This  guy is the most honest humble guy ever
Great interview from a great player
Madison speaks really well  love Leicester
A post match interview where you actually learn something about the game that was played. More of this please
Very interesting interview. I love Maddison negl
They switch off on set pieces... lamps have some work to do
Great interview. Seems a good lad.
Things he didn't say: 1)at the end of the day 2)credit to the lads 3) do that and you get punished for it 4) well it's something we've been working on in training
He was afraid to call Jack's name cause carra was calling out Jack
He surely has to be a pundit after his career
God I hope we keep him 🙏🏼
Amazing interview as always!
Seems like a sound lad
I like him more now, weird?
you can tell hes going to the top that mentality is priceless, constantly self critic and always knows anything can happen
Maddison 👏👏
Seems like a top fella. Sign him up jurgen.
He is quality on and off the pitch. Such a humble guy
Compare this to a Haaland interview lol
I like Maddison but you’re only top of the table because you’s are a game in front 😂
Wow. How good is he in interviews. This is why United should sign him not grealish
Thoughtful lad.
Not that I expect anything of England but with players like this in the squad, you never know. Great attitude, just the kind of player you want in your team
The way he s been playing recently is reminiscent to Frank Lampard  Plus just gave brilliant responses throughout the interview
Seriously I can’t remember a more charismatic and honest interview from a professional footballer ever! You just gained a fan bro I’m impressed!
Sitting top of the EPL how can you not consider yourself title challengers! Thats just a dumb thing to say...
24 years old and going bald FAST. He needs to get his hair transplant booked in and soon.
Great interview
What an interview
Why Does he remind me of Gordon Ramsay a bit
he kinda sounds like Rashford imo
Don’t worry mate no one is talking about the Tottenhams
Leicester should send Madders out for every post-game interviews, including the manager's one. Top class this!
Great, honest interview. Positive personality. Kind of player you'd want as a team mate.
He’ll be a good pundit one day
This interview lasted longer than the entire highlights for Aston Villa 7-2 Liverpool
Maddison is one of my favourite players on and off the pitch with his interviews and everything like, i dunno he just knows what hes talking about more than  anyone else really
A footballer in 2021 with a personality. Can’t believe it.
He carries himself very well and professionally
Bright lad!
I don't know what soup they have been eating but I'd love to get the same, even though it does make them a little twitchy.
Could see at Coventry, he had potential to go on to be a top player. Great to see him maturing as a young man, and realising some of that potential. England's future Bruno Fernandes? If he carries on developing and improving?
My respect for Maddison has gone through the roof. Wonderfully energetic and honest interview.
What a great interviewee. Made the same old boring questions interesting. Top stuff Maddison.
madders nice playa
Very fluent and confident, not like other players who fambles during the interview keep it up Madison
Madders is a 🐐
Always a yellow 🔰
Hope the jack isn't grealish
You can see he’s high IQ, you can also see by the way he plays - bit like Sherringham, not much pace but he has two yards in his head! International football requires a different caliber of player to the premier league - Maddison is defo suited to international football. He should be one of the first names on Southgates team sheet - he got it eventually with Grealish, now let’s get Maddison in there as well please?
You're doing good work Jack 👍
He didn't say ehhhhhhh once delighted
Euros are going to be ecstatic see him playing along in the middle Or a number 10 💪🏻
What a personality!👏🏼
I didn't catch too many use's of the word "obviously", which is a nice change when your hear from a footballler....obviously.
Haaland has better interviews.
Brilliant interview 👏
See you again in the near future when Sky Sports Retro will repost this.
Class. Madz!!!!!!!
He speaks so well.
What a post match interview! Madders is quality
Have to say what an interview he was like an analyst fantastic to see that hes recognizing where he needs to improve and telling you howhes done it .
He’d be good over mount in the England team it’s just he suffers a lot of injuries
I'd want to see manchester united sign maddison from this interview alone !!
Elite mentality
If Southgate had balls he’d find a way of fitting grealish Maddison foden into one team but knowing Southgate none of them will get into the starting 11 and he’ll revert to a back 5 with 2 holding midfielders
Leicester help every team believe, "That could be us!" Long may they.
You know madders plays fifa when he’s starts talking about custom tactics
He'll get a punditry job nooo bother
Haaland take notes
I never really watched a full interview except this
One of the best post match interviews I've witnessed from a player... Top lad, Great analysis!
Slowly falling in love with this geezer, and I'm a Southampton fan
manager in the making
James Maddison coming after akinfenwa’s laid back interview title!
What a legend
Madders can destroy you on FIFA 😂
Confident refreshing lad but some answers a bit concerning esp bout getting MY numbers up, getting people talking about ME. No mention of doing it for the team.
Refreshing to hear a professional football player that speaks well and doesn’t ya know or eeeerrrr 100 times over.  Good player too 🙌🏻
He’ll be a pundit after he retires
Maddison sounds like a manager when he is speaking lol
man just exposed leicester's tactics
Absolute class. Taking criticism constructively and taking the opportunity to develop, I think I see the captain and managerial material shining through!
This boy can give an interview 🙌
Very honest interview
Big up man like Jack the analyst. The unsung hero
good interview, but god help that trim
Great interview... sense some special things for this young man!!
Damn, give him the armband 😮
So likeable. Hope he gets into the england 11 on merit going forward.
Brilliant Amazin confidence
You can really hate Leicester tbh
Ole sign him up
What a likeable fella
Jese lingard swap with a few quid for James Maddison anyone ? 🤔🧐
Top bloke
Look forward to following this lads career. Good to listen to
now klopp can label them favorites like he did chelsea when they were on top for 24hrs
Energy
Come to Liverpool and bring Barnes with you.
Refreshing to here a footballer speak like Madison 👏👏
Jack the analyst must have given Maddison media training in preparation for a career in punditry...  "To stand out in interviews just avoid the following quotes ▪︎I'm over the moon for the 3 points ▪︎We've been working hard all week ▪︎ Obviously its great to get on the score sheet ▪︎Obviously we are delighted to be top of the league  If you manage to avoid these quotes you will sound like a footballing Nietzsche"   ~Jack the Analyst
I’ll probably check the table when i get in there😅
Personally as a manu fan he spoke honestly
What a great guy, sounded like a manager the way he was speaking
Harsh to hear when you are a Chelsea fan... But he said it all.
Speaks well
lad
Madders top class interview
Maddison is goat ngl
I actually enjoyed this interview. Can Leicester go for the title again?
Why can’t every player be like jack!
This guy is so great to listen to
I like him .. come and join Tottenham !
Terrific interview that. It's refreshing to see a player being able to talk properly instead of reciting from the employee handbook.
Racking my brain trying to remember an English player that spoke English like a normal human being since I started watching football. Failing to think of one. Maddison has a future in punditry 😅
This is a brilliant interview. Footballer with a brain in his head that hasn’t had it taken out of it by PR teams. Credit to James!
Manager potential
Pundit in the making
100% agree with him !!!!!
Maddis is captain quality with lil bit of arrogance in him.
Mesut Ozil will fit in nicely under Rogers then... careful James Maddison!
As a united fan great respect for this guy, class interview
You can see why he’s the Captian and why he should be into the England side better then the rest
nice to watch an interview with a human and not a scripted robot
Nice to hear a player talking so honestly. Top player
This is one of the best interviews I have ever listened to in football u can tell he is a future pundit he talks so honest
No need to interview Brendan Roger's after that interview. A career in punditry or management further down the line.
Fair play to him
Incredibly truthful and well spoken interview, so refreshing after so many dull interviews where players say "yeah team played well and it's an important 3 points. " James has brilliant understanding of the game and he's continuinly growing into fantastic footballer
What a great interview.
I met him once.  Really decent lad.  Not up his own arse.  And as previously stated could be a pundit one day.  Obviously understands the game.
Fully deserved 👍
My God what an eloquent man
Chale Maddison speaks so welll Herh!
Craaaackin PLUUUUR
elite mentality !
Always rated him even back at cov, would’ve loved him at villa park, like his refreshing honesty, sick of these media trained robots, you can see he’s a normal lad who’s supremely talented.
I'm a chelsea fan and Madison is class
Good Boy
Great interview Maddison
Maddison is class and also comes across that way. Top drawer
So well spoken. Looks Like a lekker ou to chill with
Carra,gary and maddders sky sports pundits trio😎
You can just tell that he is loving playing football in the premier league and loving being part of Leicester City.
An interview with free thought instead of generic answers... Maddison is class on and off the pitch.... Good on him.... 👍 👍
I love madders what a guy come on Leicester
Some footballers come across a totally dim and brainless.... not this guy. Speaks really really well!
There you go. Need to improve as a player. Just listen to some Jamie Carragher punditry. Will sort you right out 😂
A 𝙩𝙧𝙪𝙚 person and football fan loved that he gets to play the game. Great Interview
James Maddison is already a better pundit than Micha Richards
Great manager, great players... would love to see them do it again.
Leicester are looking excellent! Played really well yesterday 👏 but united will be back on top tonight 👌
There you go. Need to improve as a player. Just listen to some Jamie Carragher punditry. Will sort you right out 😂
Fair enough boy. Really talked his mind there need more of this from PL players
Very well spoken
He’s clear of grealish
I’m more confident in his ability long-term than his hairline...
Great interview but Haaland is still better
Mad to think he was playing for aberdeen in scotland few years ago on loan looked decent then
What a personality!
That's how you do an interview, no media training bollocks there.
If everyone in Leicester, acts and thinks like Maddison, credit to Rodgers. He's doing an incredible job 👏
What a guy 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Geoff shreeves gets on my bloody nerves surely I’m not the only one
He's so astute it's refreshing. He's gonna have a long career in the sport whether it's coaching after football or punditry.
Great interviewer and I hate leicester and their players. He is so normal, sick of the robot players giving cack interviews I always switch off but this guy grabs my attention
What a bloke. What a player also. Would love him at Liverpool 👌
Honestly that’s one of the best interviews I’ve seen a soccer player do
This felt more like an interview/audition to work as a pundit 😂
What a intelligent man
Honestly that’s one of the best interviews I’ve seen a soccer player do
Future manager.
Him and Conor Coady have the best interviews
Great interview
This guy will be future manager 100%
I'd love to hear his interview when things go side ways. Everyone's confident when things go well 😌
He looks like a young Wayne Rooney who didn't lose all his hair
He’s so blunt it’s hilarious 😂
This guy is a special player trust me guys.
Yes
Probably some of the best interviews in the prem at  the minute. Bloke is a breath of fresh air, hope he keeps pushing on as I'd love to see him, Grealish and Foden all supporting Kane for England. Use the other 3 of Rashford, Sterling and Sancho for pace when it's needed.
Best footballer to interview, along with Haaland. Both different style, but so good to watch and listen to.
Absolute legend
What an outstanding interview. Fair play lad
If maddison is listening to carragher he needs to enter rehab
Wow... what an interview!
Fantastic interview
What a guy madders! Loved the honesty ❤️🙌
This interview was brilliant
best interview i have ever seen
Talk about you art like you love it and think about it every second. Big lad Madders
The moment you came for: 2:22
He’s talented AND willing to work hard for the team. Proper number 10👏🏼
What a team player and a role model well in James you should be proud
This is a footballer that cares about his game & his performance. He’s dedicated & committed. He gives an insight into the level a player needs to be at to be at the top. That total focus that a player needs in oder to be successful. He’s shown his quality both at Norwich and Leicester, & he’s definitely emerging as a star player.
From watching him in the 18/19 season i always said he's better than grealish. People call me mad and say he's nowhere near. But i mean he's been injured for a long time and he still comes back and creates scores and assists. Grealish has been class and so has Maddison. They both definitely need to be in englands squad
Really enjoyed this interview. Madders and grealish for England yo
You wouldn't want him in the army getting captured by the enemy.  He would tell them everything he knows
Don’t get blinded by his interviews, this man is a complete bellend off the pitch
Leicester City as a whole are just incredible seriously. Their recruitment is unreal
What an incredible interview and insight into one of the younger players with drive and determination   Brendan Rodgers will be delighted with that
An example of someone who keeps his ears pinned back and his mouth closed until it's needed. Class.
Wow what an interview! If only there was a ‘puskas’ type award for post-match interviewing haha
This guy is talking too much😂😂😂
Quality player. Once he sorts that facial hair out I’d happily have him at Leeds 😂
What a refreshing interview, maximum respect for this guy!
Can see this guy being a manager when he retires, well spoken, thoughtful and clearly has a desire to constantly improve
Potential to be one of the best players in the world
Top top talent! He better go euros
Proper interview. Other premier players take note. Not hmmm and arghhh or not for me to say bs
Future Pundit right there. Or Manager, but can definitely talk.
He needs some Media training. He’s far to charismatic for and English footballer..
Brilliant interview, great player... Come on you Foxes 🦊
Why can't we see more interviews from footballers like this, are they all that devoid of personality?
Says "there might be teams that spend more money than us or pay higher wages".....  Nekk min... Get's signed by United, City or Liverpool for big money and higher wages 😂
Well done lad great attitude
Best player interview I’ve heard in a while, get him on more. Great talker will defo be a great pundit after football
He’s one of them players you would just love in your team, nearly every set piece he delivered today was just begging to be headed in. What a player
A footballer who can string a few words together WoW. He mentioned, " You can't carry passengers in this league, or you get found out." As a supporter who follows Wolverhampton Wanderers,  I hope Nuno listens to this interview, and does something   about our striker problem, because Silvia is currently a passenger, and if we stick with him, we could be flirting with the relegation fight. Weldone Leicester, enjoy their style of football, Brendan Rogers a top, top Manager. P.S If Nuno gets the boot, we could always sign Maddison as a player Manager😜, let's face it, his going in that direction in the future.
brilliant player.
This is a fantastic interview
Good interview but come off his ass now lads lol jheez
NGL, ben chilwell and maddison kinda look alike
one of the best interviews ive seen, made me like james even more now, elite mentality
No one is talking about Tottenham, fella!
One of best interviews from a player I have ever seen.
Celtic fans will be raging that he left them, but with a board like celtics and an offer from Leicester you can see why he bailed
They did their homework well ! This leicester side is as good as the title winning one, net spend of around 10m but mentality of a huge club, chelsea need to fix their problems asap or they are going to struggle even for a top 6 finish.
This guy understands the game so well
Best interview ever. It’s real and very honest
I think I’m a leister fan now
Hope he sees this video and has a nose at the comments, think everyone can agree he’s definitely moulding himself into a solid player 👍🏻 would happily see him in the England Kit
I’m thinking Geoff shreeves promised him a job as a pundit once his career is over, if he did a good interview, he passed !
1:15 THE SHADE
Grealish Maddison and Foden, 3 brilliant players, would be great to see them in the same side, maybe in a diamond with a holder behind them
Baller and he’s good at interviews, fair play lad
Madders will be a great pundit when he’s retired
I'm no English man but I always rate Maddison , a proper classic creative midfielder
I was glad he spoke with such freedom, especially towards the end
So honest
He’s so good with interviews,I love him plus he’s a fantastic baller
Great interview ..not cliche like most ballers  He’s know his stuff and keeps it honest, Looks like he love his football,
Brilliant. Honest. Raw. Insightful.
Watching him closely, I think he's technically better than Bruno Fernandes!   On the ball he looks more astute picking the right passes and actually completing key passes to hirt the opposition. Brendan Rodgers is a class coach and a good manager, Leicester play exciting football so I salute them.  I've got to look at Ollie because apparently we have much better players than Leicester but yet, they play the more exciting progressive football🤔
Maddison speaks well and handled the interview in a great fashion. Kudos to him.
This guy knows how to do interviews... all credit to him!!
What a guy, superb interview. Most ones are terrible, urrm urrrm urmmm urmmm but not James
Class interview. Massive future for the lad if he keeps clear of injuries. Great player.
Quality lad...see him moving to a top 4 club soon..he coupd do well at utd
What a lad, love it
This will go down as the most honest interview in history,not scripted or boring just a player buzzing
2:22 onwards is what you're here for
finally not a generic interview
I was gutted to see him leave Norwich at the time, but Madders has developed into such a quality player. Great to see.
I love this guy maaaan
So well spoken, demeanor etc.. probably won't get a job in the studio at some point in future, got boxes to tick for black pundits instead
Very intelligent footballer
Haaland & Maddison are the genuine lads before the microphones, I like watching them giving interviews
Nice to see a footballer who can string a sentence together and not give a stock "all about the 3 points" rubbish that most drivel on about.
Respect for Maddison. Top lad.
top notch personality one of the best and honest interviews.
Nice lad
He’s absolutely buzzing!
Madison is definitely going to be a football pundits after his career he talks so well or even a manager the knowledge is there to see.
What a good guy
I couldn’t tell who’s interviewing who😂
Man the one takes the criticism 👍
A good honest interview.. not the usual crap some players come out with such as "we dont look at the table" or "we take each game by game" James Madison.. a quality player!
Top lad,
Class player.
Plot twist jack the analyst is actually just jack grealish
Definetely a future pundit
So refreshing to hear, top lad
a likeable guy you know
Hala Madriddison 💘💘
This is one of those interviews you see once a season. Like we saw with Charlie Austin calling out the refs last to last season.
If you told me that Chilwell and Maddison are brothers, I’ll wouldn’t even bat an eye.
Amazing interview maddy
Comment about punditry
you might just mistake him for a fan..great interview brilliant performance👍
great interview. you can see how clever and delicate his mind is, good lad.
Very humble guy!
1:19 shoots fired at Chelsea 😂
I was amazed how good this interview was. Maddison not confirming to the norm at all
leicester pressing the way liverpool did in 13/14 and blowing teams away
You could put one of the sponsor logos on his forehead that’s how wide it is
He loves his football
Top lad... united fan here😂
Smart guy
He’s a fantastic player
Good honest interview. Fair play to him , long may it continue
Really good interview. He gave good detailed answers and he’s clearly listening and thinking about the questions and giving back his genuine opinions and thoughts. Unlike a lot of other football interviews full of sound bites and “yeah but no” one liners, this is actually not a complete waste of time.
His skysports interview
He and grealish deserves More england caps
Great interview.
This guy is just class and humble arsenal go get him
I am jack the analyst
Has he got a ferrit in his jacket pocket?
Will be gone to a bigger club next season. Sorry Leicester fans😀.
What a nice interview madders✨
Just want everyone to be clear that Geoff Shreeves is still a knob
A beautiful human bean
They switch off on set pieces 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, he killed Chelsea
And lampard will reveal that he listened to gary neville before becoming the Chelsea manager
Is it just me or is he really very well spoken for a football player of his age
Imagine how he talks about football in a pub?
Madison is a Bruno fan boy
He's autistic
Wow. He's buzzing! Maddison loves his football clearly. Refreshing to see such a candid interview.
What a fantastic, honest and realistic interview from a top player. Well done James and Leicester City.
Imagine Rice, Grealish and Maddison in a midfield 3 for England, well they need someone better than Southgate to make that work.
Madison has confidence flowing
So they do actually listen to criticism.
3:47 Love how things are going For Leicester Eventually they will replace Arsenal out of the top Six 😁
Job in punditry after his career is his if he wants it.
Rodger b has got to be the most underated manager out there klopp or pep wudnt hav Leicester top
This guy been watching Sky Sports
A Baller who can actually give an interview.... Would love to see this young English talent in Liverpool
He mocked United, some big clubs wanna use money and bring big players from abroad and go on top,hahaha, isn't he mocking bruno and United
Maddison is the definition of a modern footballer in every way
Head screwed on.  Good luck buddy
Great interview. Sky about to sign him up.
Future pundit and analyst. Has personality and is articulate. One off.
me watching a good interview but hoping @man utd go back to the top today but madders u are very good
This lad will make a kick ass commentator
His voice and approach to the game sounds more like a manager😂
Top player, top personality.
My god, what a candid, genuinely informative interview that was! James Madison, indeed! 🙌
He really likes talking about games
What a great interview. Speaks very well. Great interviewer also. Well done James.
5 in 7 ,  Grealish has 8 as his best total ever in one season and half of them were pens lol  Different levels in Maddison
You see a pundit, I see a coach
This was refreshing. This is what football should always be.
Worse hairline then Rob Holding
A guy likes him talks sincerely no wonder .
Wow. What an interview. Gives so much inside news and analysis of his own and his coach as well. No nonsense talks, straight to the point and done. Loved this!
Grassing himself up. Watch teams snuff him out now, this is the Premier league
His confidence is off the roof than these modern footballers
Great player, I like what he said about not carrying passengers
You're all seeing a career in punditry, I'm seeing one in a managerial position.
Grealish or Maddison? Fire away lads!
What a refreshing internview. Natural, speaking his mind
How well does this bloke talk
What a player.
Legit Guy 💯
I LOVED this interview!!
Madisson know how to finish an interview brilliant madders 😍
Jamie boy dont let this come back and bite u at the end of the season...only saying...ggmu
Great professional... Giving due respect where required, and also taking puns when possible...
I feel like parts of this is asking for a Streets overlay 😂 Gwan Madders lad good interview mate
An honest and refreshing interview, just what football needs!
I am not an English man but dang, what a team England is having right now.   GK : Henderson, Pope, Pickford DF : TAA, Wan Bissaka, Maguire, Keane, Stones, Chilwell, Trippier, Walker, Shaw, Reece James MF : Henderson, Saka, Mount, Declan Rice, Maddison, Grealish, Ward-Prowse, Dier,  Foden, Chamberlain Fw : Rashford, Sterling, Sancho, Calvert-Lewin, Hudson-Odoi, Kane  They could play different types of games with those sets of players. They should really target to win Euro for now, nothing less than that. Wish Vardy is there too.
Actually is the most classy player in England
Brilliant interview oh my god !!!
Confident player!
Jack the analyst. Football is all about money-ball stats now.
We are having a good start let’s hope that continues but Maddison in the other hand he’s not only a class player but when he does an interview he’s always honest & open and it’s true maybe be boring it’s 1 game at a time
Absolutely. The team spirit at King Power is as good as it gets.
What the fuk, hes opening up so much. I heard they give them scripts, i dont believe in scripts any more.  What a gem, maddison. future pundit for sure
This was so weird to watch compared to the repetitive garbage we hear week in week out
Maddison: You can't have passengers when playing for Brandon Rogers  Frank Lampard: Havertz, Werner come here.
As United fan great interview, I like this guy now
Very impressive interview. What a talent
He’s pure class!
Not that I never liked him before, but I like him a lot more right now. What an honest interview man !
England should start playing Rice, Grealish ,Madison in 3 man midfield. Rash kane sterling up.. but to protect the slow fridge they revert to 3 man... should be M.Keane and Stones in cb with Trent and Chilwell on sides.
Taylor made for punditry
A very intelligent man. I can see him being a decent pundit in the future 👍
Best interview
Future pundit
Maddison has a great personality. Honest and always positive ❤️💯👏
Him and Grealish at the Euros
WOW! After being so tired of listening footballers give the same answer for 5 different questions in an interview, it's refreshing to listen to someone give a high quality interview. The heart that he shows in the pitch is also demonstrated in the words he chooses to speak about his team.. I'm not a Leicester fan, but this feels very wholesome in a very money driven generation for football.
Sombody plz tell him, he is too good compare to players from europe cost big money.
Was it just me or was that the most entertaining interview post game I’ve ever seen
He's gonna be an amazing coach or pundit, he's a good communicator
Great interview. Little comments also shows you that they are truly coached on the details. I feel like Chelsea with Frank are not there yet and Frank should have gone and gotten a few years more of experience before taking the Chelsea job.
Fresh kinda personality. Never enjoy player's interview but title hooked me in and got a brilliant interview instead.
Future pundit
What a speaker
The technical knowledge of Maddison ...he surely can be a great manager
future top manager
This is an amazing interview
If United doesn't win it this year, please let it be Leicester City.
This is a pure interview wow , love this guy
Chelsea going to buy him. The individual contact is signed already.
An interview with some answers. Not the usual drone of 100 percent or next game or improving, which we already know by heart at this time. Cool Dude!
You have to remember guys that many of the players who are interviewed are not fluent in the language and will struggle to articulate good responses like Maddison here.
Great interview
Brilliant interview
I think this is my first time enjoying interviews
wow, great interview to watch
Haaland learn how to give interviews
Class interview
His six months on loan with us made him the player he is.
Definitely deserve a spot in the England team
What a top bloke, i hate the robot answers everyone gives nowadays.
He would make an amazing analyst
clever guy and great player.
Brilliant refreshing interview with confident, thoughtful answers. If Madders keeps working hard, his future is limitless.
Wouldn't mind Rodgers getting a title to be honest
Maddison is gonna definitely be a manager when he’s retired
What a lovely interview. Nothing robotic or rehearsed about it. Impressed with this lad.
Hope this season maddison step up and become more mature like grealish in aston villa. I believe in his prime he still better than mason mount, hope Southgate will bring him to Euro
better than overrated grealish
I plan on singing him in my career mode now. Watta lad.
I can see him working for sky sports 15 years from now. He has an excellent understanding of the game and is an amazing player.
Rooney used to give these back in the day
what a guy he’s class coming from a brentford fan
Very nice interview indeed good lad it is.
For the first time in English football history, has a footballer given a 3+ minute interview and didn't use the cliche "At the end of the day."
Carragher is cry babe he always criticize other players except Liverpool players
What a great lad. Could listen to his interviews all day. Real breath of fresh air. Really great style and you just can see how much he loves playing and doing what he does.
Kids a natural pundit
"Havertz not playing good bc he is not playing his position" is absolute bs..and this interview proves it
Best player interview I have seen in ages. Fair play to the lad.
How can you not like Madders
geoff scrounging around I can't stand it
What a guy
What an amazing Interview Maddison seems like a really nice guy
That was the best interview I have seen in a long time, future manager or pundit for sure,
Who ever is reading this blessings goes to you n ur family ;)
This guy gives a good interview
I love madders as a footballer and just an all round quality guy
He just reminds me so much of David Beckham 😄
Can’t hate this guy. Honestly love this guy cmon Madders
Future Captain Material
madders always gives great interviews. none of the cliches he actually gives his opinion on the match. he’s got such a mature head on his shoulders. if he sticks at leicester for a few more years i’d love to see him get the armband
Nice and relaxed and honest seems like a top lad. Wish more people in sports spoke as openly and down to earth in interviews.
Did he say I thoroughly deserve 3 points
Well that was refreshing.
This is quite possibly the best interview I’ve ever seen
I like the way James Maddison answering questions, he's so genuine.
Better then the old days when u had Rooney going ewwww yeah gd game ewww me played well yeah ewww you thank ewww bye
The last part about mentality was gold. Leicester is like a beacon of hope for people who who don't have too much in life, but try and do the best they can with what they've got.  What it takes is hardwork, teamwork and belief. The Foxes Never Quit. 🦊❤️
Love this guy madders what a guy!
Madison looks like a year 7er with his older brothers jacket on lol
I would love to see him in an Arsenal shirt.
Utd fan but like Maddison is such a down to earth , any club would want his for his hard work and personality
Great interview, very articulate. I think we already know what he should do after his playing career.
Such a smart likible and very talented young man.
Leicester ain't  winning the title just like the interview stating facts and being g honest
Finally some of that old-school interview stuff. 🥺
Impressive interview
A very level headed guy.
Grealish and Maddison duo in Euros is what I ask for Gareth
their owner should've seen this...
This guy actually made me realize. Maybe footballers aren’t dumb, why can’t every interview be like this instead of the same answers every single day.
He's already a better pundit than Carragher.
Hold on , what’s this? An English footballer who can converse ?
Maddison has the thinking of a coach, mark my words he will go on to management at the end of his career
A class player I’d love to see him at arsenal he’s so well spoken and he seems like a very intelligent footballer
Good lad from an ev fan
Always struck me as a top guy and this interview just reaffirms that. Good to see him developing on the pitch too.
Real class and honesty in this interview, gotta say I was doubting him at the start of the season but he’s on some form
"Lovely Bloke that lad" he's always real.... None of them scripted, dire, shitte answers they spill out of their Trap!!??
I really love this guy ..he's a really humble guy who works hard and always tries his best in every game. ~Man utd fan
Why doesn’t every player speak like this lad,instead of being false acting and trying to be COOL 😎 This lad is the genuine article others please follow👍From a sad Shoreham boy sufc
One Word about this interview  HONEST 100 %
yeah, the best interview of the season.
Can see him playing for Real Madrid one day
Maddison and Oxlade-Chamberlain would have great punditry/football personality type careers after playing football.
Maddison looks a lot like Chilwell.
Wow this guy is awesome.
Now that’s an interview 👏🏽👏🏽
My respect for Madders after this interview 📈
God he’s just so likeable
Sounds like OGS 😅
Did I just become a James Maddison fan?
Haaland needs to take interview lessons from him 😂😂
Ok Carra... now criticize Liverpool players please, tell them to get their numbers up. Maybe they'll listen like Maddison did!!
If he does he will score loads of own goals 😂😂
Easily one of the most authentic interviews I've seen from a footballer - so refreshing
This man can be a future manager, I can smell it 💥🤩
Best commentary ever 👏👏
What a guy
He looks comfortable with the ball and camera
I love his arrogance 'I want everyone talking about me'...they are talking about you. 20 mil for this lad now sounds like we ripped norwich clean off. Man u will be trying to buy him in a few years for 120 million, unfortunately we already sold our last fridge and are now out of stock.
he moves so much when he’s talking jheez
Held himself well during that interview fair play. 👏
Fantastic head on his shoulders, clearly switched on
carragher sitting at home saying "I wished I kept my mouth shut" 🤣🤣🤣
Madders and Rice are so easy to listen to in these.
Leicester for Champions League next season!
Future captain
It's a shame Grealish and Madders play in similar positions. Each game they outdo each other to try and stake their claim to be in Southgate's XI
😘😘
Nice to see he wasn’t sick as a parrot just listening to the gaffer about sticking it on someone’s head.
Cocky but respect him
Actually sounds like a conversation and not a player being media trained practically following a script, so fair play
Future skipper
Manager in progress
Brendan Rodgers told him what to say
He'll be a good manager one day. Fluent, articulate, and says all the right things instinctually and honestly.
A top top English player, the goals he scores are sensationa. Deserves England squad all day long
Comes across like a top fella nice lad made up for him 👏
Madders 😍🐐🤩
Maddisons never been humble
What a delightful chap !
I LIKE HIM😂
amazing
Madders Madders Madders. I see another 2016 Leicester shock on the cards Innit.
Quality just oozes from this gent. Top top player
Top top bloke great interview
Brendon Rodgers in
So nice to hear a footballer with a brain
Fam is this guy a pundit or a player? 😂😂
Put grealish lw, and maddison someone with hebdo in the middle. Rashford/sancho etc can compete for rw. England genuinely can become a dominant on the ball team, where you don't need defensive players because like Spain you are technically too good. Maddison foden grealish together, you aren't touching them
Like we said in 2016. A trophy was earned not bought. And today we are top of the league and it was earned
Underrated player
good talker, i wont complaint listen to his interview with journalist for like 10 hr
He’s such a talent & much of Europe are sleeping on him such a good player only getting better by the day top lad
Speaks well.
How refreshing to see proper honest and unrobotic answers for once. Maddison is a top bloke and leader. Apart from France, England have the best depth in world football
I just love Madders he is one of us man, so confident when talking, amazing player glad he is doing well.
looks like he had the number game sorted out
The interviewer is asking good questions tho not questions that would receive one worded punch lines or answers like the interviews with haaland but respect to madders and the interviewer for their conversation and not one worded punch lines
If he doesn't become a pundit after football, it's a travesty.
He actually talks like a manager
Great interview. U can tell he is a mad footy fan as well. Its open honest and fresh to listen to
Imagine him on the packet, the talking would be incredible
This man can't be anything other than just James Maddison. Gotta be 1 of the best people to interview n to have in your squad.... To me he's seems like he's itching to do something all the time... Cracking personality 👊
The most refreshing interview I’ve heard in a long time :)
He will be a future manager. Most players are too similar, "I am happy, the team worked hard, on to the next". This man offered a bit of tactical insight, showed he was on the field using his brain and also  "entertained" me.
That is 1 of the best interviews I’ve seen in a long time maddy go on ya fat son
A respect how he actually told you how like they changed things to make it work
Top lad
Mate  here coventry we very very happy for you welldone lad
Imagine a player taking onboard an independent observation about deficiencies in his game and working on it to improve it.
I love Lester Maddison nidi choudary Barnes love those lads
He’ll succeed. Amazing attitude.
I thought I would see Jamie whispering as always
This guy is amazing not only in the way he plays but also speaking. BTW, Leicester outplayed Chelsea in every way and deserved to win the match. A Chelsea fan since 1996.
Future sky sports pundit
Student of the game! Top class
Putting a tenner on him presenting MOTD one day
You had kante, mahrez, sculz, schlurl, ndidi, telemmans... They are foreign
As a Chelsea fan, I admire Maddison. Only deluded Chelsea fans think Mount is better but in all honesty, Mount in his prime will be nowhere near James Maddison who hasn't even reached his peak
I really hope he comes to Liverpool. He's so good.
Imagine how annoying madders would be on ❄️
Fair, honest and articulate.
Best interview I have seen
What an interview, very down to earth and honest. Top guy.
Big up Jack the analyst. They don’t get enough credit but some of the most important guys in football clubs nowadays are nerds who look at computers all day.
Such a refreshing and honest interview. You can tell he loves playing for Rodgers & Leicester.
Definitely signing him on fifa now!
Leicester have a better chance of winning the league than Man United
Wouldn't be able to shut this guy up with a few pints in him..
Superb interview, intelligent and wise.
What a guy 👏👏
He’s a sick lad with a sick mentality. Would love him at utd but nevertheless. What a player
The title 2:25 🕜
0:24 Usually the point where other players awkwardly stop talking and wait for the next question... but he proceeds to go further and give a good analysis of Leicester's strengths. Very good interview
Very good interview big up madders 👑
His a better signing for chelsea then Harvetz
Love this guy. He's a great pro, plus super talented.
What a champion!
Brilliant interview
jeez so much respect for his teammates calling them all by full names. Kinda funny but hella respectful 😤
Will never forget his freekick Vs the rangers, to this day the best goal in his career.
you can tell already he'll be a great manager or pundit after retirement haha
Does he ever stop talking, let the interviewer get some words in
Definitely a pundit of the future
The mentality of a player who played for like 10 years amazing player
Love these type of interviews rather than the classic robotic media trained interviews were used to seeing
Him & Declan Rice speak so well in interviews.
Would love him at Liverpool, what a lad and baller!
The fact Mount is considered in the same class as Maddison and Grealish is mind blowing to me, he’s a decent player but these lads are a class above imo England starting line up should be   Kane  Grealish/Maddison/Sterling or Rashford   Rice/Henderson  Shaw/Mings/MaGuire/TAA  Pope or Henderson  Tbh Chilwell, Reece James, Wan Bisakka, Coady, Gomes and Stones could all be in the starting line up, I honestly don’t see a massive difference between them, I think our only weakness is centre half’s everywhere else we have great strength in depth. You could even put Walker in to make up for MaGuires lack of pace, if we want to play counter attack put Wan Bisakka instead of TAA as he’s a better defender but awful going forward.
Man city are going to get this guy
What a well spoken bloke
Great player , Great professional , Great Man.
As a Chelsea fan I rated him over greslish better modern day presser of the ball best alround number 10 England’s got.
What a lad !! Top player with feet on da ground !! A prime example to others ....
Class interview👏🏽
You can't not like Madders
Possibly one of the most honest interviews I've watched. I had the impression that Madison was a bit of a jack the lad and was all about himself. This has proven me wrong. Great interview,
Utd should sell pogba and buy him
James Madison, the 4th president of the United States
Hi there
Madisson-  He is auditioning for a sky position just incase his football career doesnt work out
When Maddison retires he will present on some football show like match of the day
He will make a good pundit
QUALITY
Im a united fan and as much as id love maddison or harvey barnes at the club, I hope they stay at leicester and maybe win the prem sometime (if united dont) or win a trophy. They're class acts and I love watching them play and seeing them be successful.
Wow this guy could be a pundit or a manager in the future and would give fantastic interviews. He speaks so clearly
After seeing this interview I want Liverpool to sign this man.
I would do anything to have him in my team, genuinely :(
Class interview
Soon to be a red devil 😉🔴🔴🔴
Unpopular opinion: Maddison> grealish
Loved him..... Has a tad bit of naughtiness in him and a killer smile❤️❤️❤️❤️
Maddison s brilliant in front of the media
Brilliant interview, I've never heard him speak before - this is really enjoyable
Beautifully honest
What a nice interview
Speaks so intelligently. And has the skill to back it up. Doing England proud
Probably one of the most composed interviews I’ve seen on here.
U can tell it'll certainly be difficult to get players off Leicester with the good spirit and relationship they got with the club
Sound lad
He's so refreshingly 'normal' in interviews. Happy to talk about punditry, his strengths and weaknesses and decent analysis of the team performance. Good lad Madders
I really like listening to MADD’s talking! He speaks sense and I hope he has a fantastic career.........👏🏻👌🏻👍🏻
Probably one of the best player interviews I’ve watched, honest and instinctive
Very good talker, no ‘erms’ and ‘yeahs’ like most do
What an interview
Absolute hat off!
Why can’t others talk like this hahaha, everyone else is so dead in their interviews
As a Chelsea fan ,great interview. He was class today. Would love to see him and mount together in midfield for England
Make him a Manchester Boy in the Summer.
James maddison is one of the most down to earth guys in the prem he so genuine with his answers
Overlooked by players like mason mount,  Maddison is leaps and bounds ahead of him in most senses of the game
Carragher 1 - 0 Neville 🤣
There are 2 types of interviews: 1. Maddison 2. Haaland
What a jolly good chap. Honest and refreshing and not up himself like so many. He works hard, speaks sense and I wish him well.
Captain quality.
He speaks well, well done
Class interview
what a lad
Love this. Hate the media trained robot answers the players give these days.
Top player and seems like a sound lad
Why is it that this is the best, most thoughtful and insightful interview I've ever heard from a footballer
Its  so crazy how honest he is tho    The guy is already a legend😇
He speaks like the english Andy Robertson
Love this lad
Mason Mount or Maddison who's better?
He drifted onto the back line and so is his hair. Great player
Would be great if they won it again they have a great chance.
What an interview. Great player.
Nearly as in depth as Haaland interviews that one, fair play madders💪🏼
Great lad and interview
You can tell he won't be joining no other team in the Premier league
This man will be a commentator for sure
Maddison is a future pundit!
Keane "Yeah but that's his job"
What a legend
Love this man. Speaks from the heart and not from a script
underrated
That's all Jamie carragher ever does  Crtisize others   All these negative comments  From a man who almost won the league   Pipe down Jamie
He's got the passion to go into coaching/management after he's retired from playing...you can just see it
400th comment
Maddisons career trajectory is looking cushty. Performing like a top player. Still with time to grow into a legend of the sport. Has a analytical mind and knows the game more than enough to be a future manager. But also has the gift of gab to be a great pundit one day.
He just loves talking, watching, playing football!
Maddison over Grealish all day
You can tell that he'll be so chuffed to Talk Tactics with his Coach everytime lol
It’s so refreshing to hear a player actually speaking his mind rather repeating what he’s been told to say
This is the best Premier league season in years, it's still anyone's title.
he such a class player just very skillful
How tf is he so confident
He gives too much details he is coach won’t like it
He’s basically saying Chelsea are dead 😂😂
What a guy
Quality player, getting better as the season progresses. Would love to see him at Man utd. He has the mentality to play for a big club.
Professional, Wholesome and intelligent! Can see him being on sky sports shows when he’s retired.
Future pundit. Very well spoken, knowledgeable. As a Man City fan, if we don't win the PL I wouldn't mind seeing LC winning it again.
You know Brandon Rogers is a good Manager when you see a cocky James Maddison at his best time after time..
Might put on money on him hosting MOTD
Best Mid England could have to offer and he doesn't even play 😤
What a lad!
First time I ever watched a whole interview, Maddison is a different breed in general
Nothing to hate about him. Fantastic player he is
Hard not to like this guy
He literally sounds like a manager/pundit
So refreshing to see an interview like this. Big big fan of Maddison
Nice 1 cara
People give away more in police interviews than some footballers do post match these days, Maddison’s different keep it going👏.
No offence to James, great interview, but it's amazing how so many people are flabbergasted by the fact an Englishman is well spoken is his own language! Not setting the bar very high there, are we lads?!
One of the best interviews I’ve seen
An educated and articulate footballer...almost as good an analyst as Micah richards. Almost .
He’s the opposite of Haaland during an interview
"We're top of the table cause we don't think like that" What an answer.
Get him on the plane, Gareth!
What an honest interview.
Such a refreshing interview
Really enjoyed listening to Maddison in this interview. So insightful and honest. Brilliant!
Hindsight is great isn't it. Just shows that 2016 Title Win really wasn't a fluke cus they've now bought players who have that Leicester winning mentality and Quality
Him and Robertson has a future as pundits after their careers
What an interview ! No player talks like that , brilliant.. big fan of him
James forgets the script at home lol
great honest review, great player also but he's not goina take grealish's place for england now but could be his backup.
“ Probably for about 24 hours “  Maddison has no respect for Aston Villa 😂😂😂😂😂
A good listen that. He clearly is really switched and aware on how he can improve his game. He's got amazing quality too!
TO think Leicester haven't scored a single goal this season from set pieces when you got Maddison and Tielemens dropping absolute quality 9/10 balls every time
Is it too hard to have all players talk like that before or after a game instead of being trained robots? Well done, Madders! great game and a fantastic interview. LFC fan here.
This is a real interview. Good to see there are still some within the game with an actual personality.
Can we get Maguire to reach out to his old team mate on how to do an interview without looking dead inside
These lads make it very hard to not like this team. Always impressed but what they do.
Finally a player that doesn’t cap
Just a player, talking like a person, with no restraints, need to see this more as oppose to the robots we see more often
Maddison to replace pogba at United
Top lad deserves to start for England. From a chelsea fan they were miles better than us today.
Top performance and top interview and top player. Well done madders
What a player. The way he speaks is so honest and just flipping intelligent.
What a humble lad such a positive person love to see him playing well speaks so well
Could listen to him talk all day long
This is why we love madders doesn't talk like the average footballer bs. Probably the only prem player i can watch full match interview
Talks a good game this lad. He knows his craft. Love listening to an inspired and enthusiastic footballer.
This man can’t stand still 🤣
All the other robots in the prem should take note - this is how you conduct yourself in an interview. Very refreshing to see.
Lfc fan here,but I think he has a great player here,with a top attitude,and quite a free speaking guy unlike so many,due not to them,but clubs believing they must have media coaching(which I understand) but often it turns them sort of robotic in answering.
Sound lad and potential top player
this is one of the best post match interviews I’ve seen! he isn’t giving pr based answers love it. can see him going straight into punditry once he’s retired.
This guy would do awesome as a pundit
the opposite of haaland
1:19 cheeky dig at the bigger clubs like Chelsea for example who don’t look like they have a team spirit and have too many players whereas Leicester has a nice core with 2 or 3 additions to their squad keeping a good team spirit and madders comes across a level headed and a strong personality. Keep it up 👍
Cracking interview, so honest and refreshing! Fair play to the lad
One of the best players in the league and as much as I'd love for him to play for us at a club like United nice to see Leicester hanging on to star players instead of selling them like kante and mahrez and his loyalty to the club is what makes also and player
This interview was pure class!
Have him on every time ffs brilliant interview
So nice to see such a natural interview from Maddison it’s refreshing to see
This guy is a footballer or a pundit
Honestly I have no idea how this guy isn't starting for england... i guess they prefer to pick players from "the big clubs"
Terrific character I mean that genuinely for once
This boy is pure class
Why’s my man talking like he’s a manager 🤣
Damn top interview
He needs to be in the England squad for the euros, the English talent we have at the minute is more than capable of winning something
The guy is class, and compared to some overpaid overseas imports worth his salary and some.
More Maddison interviews please! Why haven't I ever heard him speak, so honest and open. Nice one mate, from an Arsenal fan.
He does a good interview for a young lad. Just needs to stop the nervous ear touching like Rooney et al never seemed to get past.
Maddison on fire in all areas! Big tv career when he finishes football unless his uses his brains in other more creative and useful direcions. Before then plenty more great goals from him!
He's the best at interviews iv'e ever seen
Future GOAT PUNDIT I SEE, DOING "HEATED" DEBATES WITH GREALISH IN 2035
"you dont play for brendan rogers if you dont do the dirty work"
Madders is a future Sky pundit without a doubt - get him on the pundit team now please!!  A natural!
adam be maddison
A footballer who doesn't give one word dead answers.
As a man utd fan respect to lesta and maddison
You can tell he'll be a manager some day
How Mount is preferred over this lad is beyond me
Do other players just get nervous or something? Cuz he’s the only one who seems to have a clue
Speaks like Joe Hart. And has same mannerisms.
he interviews so well, it's actually incredible.
Maddison isn't 1 of these media trained puppets!
Needs to wind it in abit, remember your a player not a pundit
can we have this guy every week please
Really respect this guy for his interview, knew what he was talking about unlike some other players and managers, first time i have listened to a player's full interview
Maddison is one of the most well spoken footballers around
Never watched a interview twice till now 👏
Really suffers with self confidence I'd say!
Absolute baller. Brilliant mind.
The way he’s talking so maturely shows he’s definitely going to be a future captain whether it’s at Leicester or another club
Quality interview! With personality and enthusiasm for his craft top player!
Future England Captain and top manager
Gotta be honest, he only talks facts
What a guy
That was the best ever Interview I have ever seen in my life!! Stunning
Very articulate young man—-Refreshing!!!!
Most people being interviewed on camera are stiff, not just footballers.
You've just gotta love this guy. Always honest, modest and a bit of a laugh. Proper down to earth lad. Would be great to see him at Arsenal but I doubt that'll ever happen.
He’s already far better than so many pundits out there..!!
Future manager ? 💯
get him on monday night football
I've brought madders straight into my fpl team on the back of that interview. Class act
The twelve dislikes are the Chelsea squad members and Lampard
I’ve never seen a mans haircut to suit their personality as much hahaha top lad 👏
Future great manager.
He is one of the best players Leicester has ever seen, optimises Leicester this season, the future is bright with us! Up The Foxes
Future England manager
Real recognise real
Only for about 24 hours 😂
He looks like David Beckham
Sound lad
I like how natural he is in interviews. A breath of fresh air!
To the 1% reading may God blessed with good health and prosperity 🙏  I want to be a big youtuber one day
Great player
Always rated him but he's maturing on & off the pitch now too. Want to see guys like Maddison, Barnes & Ward-Prowse in and around the England squad. Hungry players with quality & good characters.
If maguire is worth 80 million, Fofana is worth 160 million
Great interview talks like a real person not with some scripted bs 💯
Man speaks like a gaffer/pundit. 😂😂Clearly he is set after he retires from playing football.
Has to be with england for the euro2021
one of the best player interviews, looks like he is acc being honest and isnt being told what to say which is good
He’s gonna be a great pundit  listen to him goo
David beckham regen
This interview is so clean🤣🤣🐐
How refreshing to see a relaxed, charismatic and informative interview, instead of the monotonous, cliched guff we usually get, with most of the players energy going into rubbing his face or ear. 👏🏻
Never heard him speak before. Seems a nice chap
What a guy👏
Good to see him indirectly talking to Southgate about contention to start bold and has a real chance!
Love Maddison, what a player and bloke !
James Maddison is a future manager
Very natural talker, good interview
Articulate and eloquent.
What a quality fella. Captain material.
He's got a good attitude, you can tell.
Remember watching this guy in Scotland, top player
Great Lad
great interview speak well
Sounds like me after a fut champs win
Him & coady future pundits mark my words
Class player, class team. I really enjoy watching them play even when they lose. What a story Leicester has, every team in the championship would look to them for inspiration.
One of the best interviews I’ve ever seen tbh
Fernandes and debruyne have set the bar so high without numbers and stats nobody respects u credit to maddders he is a brilliant humble footballer!
Class interview 👏
Calling it now......future pundit. Talks well & plays well.
Very intelligent mature lad.
james maddison speaks so well. ole brendy must be rubbing off on him
MY CAM
Lad has a future in punditry or maybe even management. Breath of fresh air to see a someone of this generation with a mature head and well spoken too. Maybe will need to slow his speech down a bit lol.
Sad how it's so unusual hearing a footballer talking like a human being, great interview!
How could you dislike this video
This guy has a future career in punditry you can just tell
Wish we saw more interviews like this, love Maddison’s honesty
He is so honest 👍👍
Sounds like he'd be a cracking pundit! Probably be a good manager as well.
Wudnt mind him at Liverpool great player
Humble AF 👌
LiVARpool
Really good confident player and great in interview. Good to see personality. Not a Foxes fan but enjoyed this.
gareth southgate r u watching
Its nice to see an English player that can actually speak English for a change
Him and Grealish 😍
Imagine how much shite this guy would talk with a few pints on him
One of the best interview. You can learn so much about the player and the game inside through this professional Interview. The sincerity came through. Well done Leicester and Maddison.
Quality operator
Respect to Maddison, but even more to Rodgers, doing a fantastic job
Leicester will win the league
Jack the analyst is buzzzzzing
What a knob. Fancies himself and talks as if he is the manager
I support Man Utd but have the up most respect for Leicester city, it’s amazing what they’re achieving and the togetherness they have as a team is what every club should be aspiring to be like
Madders is a top lad
Finally a person with personality
I quite like this Lad all that Cliche worked hard 3 points good team stuff gets boring. Gave us some actually interesting stuff gave us a genuine view of what he thinks and spoke like a Football fan like the rest of us are
Showing some serious character that kid! Sick of media-trained nonsense interviews
Damn. A footballer who has a personality. 👌🏻
Fantastic conversation!!
For sure deserves to be in England squad
I used to think he was too arrogant for his own good. He's proving me wrong. Developing and maturing really nicely
This is how interviews should be done--Honest and Instinctive. Not like speaking with robots we see everyday. Brilliant madders.
Refreshing interview. Top young player.
Future pundit
If I didn't know who he was I'd think this was a manager interview. Not even joking 🧐🧐🧐
Madders future pundit future manager
One of the best interviews I’ve watched that👍
Maddison, true baller⚽️ 😎
Leicester are more part of the “super 6” now than arsenal
Jamie carragher is a absolute bellend ...you dont really need to listen to bellends
I’ve said it for a long time now but he’s a baller from a United fan, he has to be in that midfield with grealish and most likely Henderson
Everyone was sensational today they are going to keep rolling
Top bloke
Better player than what Chelsea have available
Geeza looks like chillwell
A great player and a great interview. Honest and authentic. Not just artificial answers.
What a fantastic interview hes one for the future, class act
Maddison the only player i know who talks like a pundit/fan
Madders in the goat 🐐🐐
James Maddison a future pundit then manager
Come to Man U Maddison we will welcome you with open arms ✌🏿
Quality interview from a quality player.
Maddison is class. Every club would kill to have a player of the profile of him or Grealish.
Maddison for euro starting 11
No one gives us the credit we deserve!!🦊
Actually gives good interviews and isn't stiff or anything
Lol tf is madders sounding like a manager 😂😂😂
Should Lampard get sacked?
great interview from a top player
Nice and refreshing to see an honest interview from a premier league footballer. Quality player!
Legend he is listening to advise is shows how down to earth he is
Who's better Mason or Maddison?
Leceister shows Chelsea that they are superior.
The foxes are a class side 👍
Chelsea overrated team
First
Great player maddison is sometimes goes under the radar 👍🏼
First
