How did you change the camera
Now I’m beginning to love NFL  beautiful sport . Had to learn the rules to the game never been more interested . Definitely buying and watching it everyday
I came in to see if buying Madden 24 was gonna be worth it, and ended up staying for more than a handful of hours watching your videos.  Brother, you are TOPS in entertainment value on youtube.  Mad props.
8:49 😤
How did u get your camera angle like that as a corner back
how do you do the diving catch
How is he having help with the zone? Letting him know what players to watch and when it's a run? Is that rookie mode?
how to you get strafe and cut stick to show up above your head during play like at 2.40 to 2:50
To many injuries😂
So nobody gonna talk about bro already tearing his ACL when he showed the injuries😭
How do you get the advice over the head of your player ?
I needed to hear that “the user the user”😂😂 bring back child hood memories been watching qjb since ncaa
small question how do you change your camera from 4:11 to 4:15 ?
@QBJ how do I player lock cause I’m pressing l3 twice and it’s not working
LFG!!! 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥  we fighting n all.
that pick just made me want to go CB even more lol ty
E A R L Y

You can do better QJB  SUM TIMES YU NEED THAT COMPUTER HELP
Da USA da USA 😂
Yo how u switch teams
How do I change my camera angle to be like this
Plz don’t end login bridges
Let’s get it 🤟🏾🔥🔥
Qjb is pretty wholesome imo
how do u get the cb player lock camera like that
How to u sub yourself in the middle of the field
Who remembers when QJB used to do the, “DATS NASTY!…..PEEEEEAAAAAACCCCEEE!” Himself
Game is trash why he keep running outside the red line 🤣🤣🤦🏾
Man I love QJB I been watching him since 2016
Can you change the cam view
i'm not an expert, but isn't he playing a bit more like a LB than a CB ?
“The user The user” 😂😂 love it
Man, what's up with this shitty camera angle they added in 23? Shit is wack.
Who ever still playing Madden on the ps4 don't get it, still the same thing as last year
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
@qbj I fw yo videos
You Know you’re about to Lose to a Guy when he has his Own Nursery Rhyme lol 😂
How do you switch the camera to the player view? I cant see a dang thing from the qb on deep plays playing corner.
yo did anyone else see that blocc @ 12:58 ? son got absolutely punished 😂😂😂😂😂
How do you proceed after you change your gear before you start the preseason. It keeps saying I’m missing something in the change gear option.
What plays do you use
Was robbed by GameStop today on my digital code for madden 24 even after calling customer service they only sent me the bonus content codes like what tf I’m supposed to do with that without the full game code
Superstar mode is trash I’m fuckin over madden
QJB Jaguar is a W
THE USER THE USER 😂😂
if you do change it up bring back his son
How did you change the DB camera?
bring back ultimate team loved thats series!!
So they  copied 2k
THE USERRRR!!!!
Nahhh the Jacksonville defense out here starting s**t 😂😂😂
Yo, we need a part 2 to this one.
The gameplay is fire
Lol stats are still as wonky as ever I see. Says 10 solo tackles in the row by row view, 8 solo tackles in the performance view. 🙈
Damn bruh you gon take Ridley #0?
The teammate grade doesn’t make sense, you grade decreased and they didn’t even run or throw your way. Hopefully that gets fixed or removed
QJB's match itro is fire!!!! In the Sky will never get old!!!
Btw the Oklahoma drill is banned in Oklahoma
They need to make the CB position like it was in NCAA14 where they primarily throw the ball in your direction it would be so fun
You can’t get rid of London bridges this why we come to the Channel 🫡 it’s the user picks
Does madden call the plays or is it up to the user again?
Coming in clutch with the cb gameplay that’s what I’m going with it’s always a challenge qb and Hb are always the easiest keep it up
These player models are TERRIBLE
STILL WANT TO SEE HIM WIN A CHIP/CHAMPIONSHIP WITH THE CHICAGO BEARS.............
If this is your last season by using London Ba ba ba ba Bridges I have an Idea for ya what in superstar mode in Ea Madden NFL 25  what about using Tyler Ba ba ba Bridges Junia (Tyler Bridges Jr.)
Annoying af.
I love how Jonathan Taylor babied 23 and got bodied and limped off the field
Do a franchise!!!
It shouldn’t be your fault that the other team is getting first downs, EA needs to work on that grading system but game-wise, Madden is finally looking solid and interesting 💯
The user the user ❤❤❤
London kills it again in another debut.
only thing i wish is the cpu would call plays for you seems more realistic
Its like 2k with the grades
Are you able to build a stadium? What are the newest locations you can go too??
The detail of the  impact of the ground casues the players body to bounce when diving 🔥🤌🏿
What difficulty you think is best ?
"In the sky" still goes go hard 🔥🔥🔥
What defense formation do you usually use
Some of these animations are crazy
Totally excited about this madden about time they added more customization to a player
Game looks the same to me they added new animations and added the whole 2k my career teammate grade
the pads look bulky compared to madden 23
Hey QJB why don't you change sides and go WR?
Am I the only one that thinks they should add a D end, tackle or O line career. Madden has always been skill player based and never stood out in the trenches
dude you dont play like a corner back plays you would stop alot of plays from happening if you would play like a corner should and this is coming from a defensive lineman
Get ready guys we're gonna have the same Presentation for the next 10 years
london been round since 2012 2013
The gameplay and the new animations go crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS WAS COOL.............
😂brody need to learn how to play zones he look goofy
Make his son next year just an idea
They gotta fix the grading system you shouldnt go down because someone else gave up a first down, you should be graded strictly off your sole performance
did they at least add dreads so we can add to our players
Your a CB that plays in a LB spot trying to bait the  QB to throw to your guy u are suppose to be out covering... ive seen u do this for years..... not hating just saying whatever floats your boat,   love the vids tho,     but sometimes ill see that u are suppose to be covering the slot and u are moved in like a LB,     i will say the  first pick u had was nice...  but ya the way u bait the AI qb to throw  to your guy sometimes haah, i see  i see..
It look so good I wish I could afford it tho
🔥
I'm really mad that we still can't get the dreads or long hair through the helmet this year. It's ridiculous. Should be an easy fix for Madden. Just give us the head models from create a superstar. This is like the 3rd year in a row. It just kills the immersion for me. Like look at Richardson's hair. It's smooth. Great content thought bro. Love watching London Bridges.
I was wondering why a celebration was a preorder bonus. Charging for celebrations..
@QJB please do create a player review
Gameplay is very good and im excited but im bummed out that you still get to choose the defensive plays let the coach choose and run with it that’s not fun
QJB franchise wouldn’t sound to bad🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Can you please wear the axiom helmet pleaseeeee
Dude your videos are always a banger Fr now 24 out it will be so much better
Im actually excited to play Madden for once
I wish we could watch them play instead of seeing a sim. Put a coach came or sky cam. Or even watch from the sidelines with your player. Make it more realistic🤷🏾‍♂️
Qjb you should use the legends son after you retire London 🔥🔥
Why Richardsons hair be lookin like Kat Williams? Is that how all dreads/braids are gonna look? Damn
Keep the Madden videos koming🔥🔥
London Babababa Bridges
15:32 DA USER DA USER
why they let you choose the play ..i hope we can change it in the menu ..🙏🏽
Madden 24 is out in 3 days
Is this the new fotf? Or just regular franchise
Die hard NFL fan but madden been ass so long now I only play 2K as my sport game and glad this is looking a lil close to MyCareer . Wasn’t gonna buy madden until next year madden with the new NCAA game but imma get 24 now just for the career mode
I don't understand why the dreads don't hang out on filed???? It's been couple years at this point say something to madden
So happy they put all the positions back
So EA trying to be 2k with the teammate grade that’s fire
Madden should add option for creating both offensive and defensive player on the same team so you can play both sides of the ball instead of simulating
That ending was fire
He’s playing more like a hybrid rover linebacker opposed to cornerback.
Yes suuuurrrrr…. We gotta see you do a franchise mode for sure. And maybe with every team if you can fade it…
jus need them socks to be updated, turf tape wit undershirt, more armbands and customization is perfect
Duuuvallll
❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🫰🏾🫰🏾
The best first madden game ever on madden
Bring back the legend son its been 3 years
Been watching you for a min now and love the Londoooonnn Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-briiiddgesssssss! You can't retire him Fam 😢  In all seriousness, love your videos brotha. Keep up the great gameplay and commentary!  Sing it with me.... THA USE-AAAAA THA USE-AAAAAA, THA USE-AAAAA THA USE-AAAAAA THA USE-AAAAA
QJB back with some banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger yessir
wr
Did anyone see the Colts lineman getting that pancake @ 12:58 🥞
So can you choose other positions to play because one video I saw it said you couldn't
They need to add the basketball wristbands in the game wat josh Allen have on his right hand on the cover
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!! move a team that really needs it! Make a realistic rebuild and win the superbowl
Mama there go that man
Time to shine💯Lb
The game looks so 👍good!!
How about his son
"In the Sky" intro wil never not get old too iconic especially when its hyping up London Bridges 🔥🔥
If only they could give us the regular superstar camera
I hope they bring the animation when you pick it off you and your team goes to the other end zone and celebrate
That “In The Sky” will never get old 😭
Omg I'm in love with the Camera angle... that may convince me to be a back as well
I love your videos
Keep posting!!!
Yessir 🫵🏾🔥🔥
