PERFECT My Ed Sheeran love you ❤❤
First off, you can always tell an artists talent by listening to their acoustic versions. It makes it so every error you make stands out   Second, I find myself wanting to sing the harmony with the chorus, as he does for the crowd live... Thank you for giving me that breadcrumb, and I adore this song. It's so beautiful. I will never tire of hearing it, and I absolutely love it when it's Acapella and the crowd gets going. For once there is true peace.
It has been 4 years listening to this but feels special every time ❤
Everglow 💡✨✨✨✨✨👌💡🇬🇧💡
Who is here on 2025 ❤
Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your head A million colours of hazel, golden and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing, Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
😂 LOVE YOU TOO 🎇💋🎶💯💕💕💕
Quantum song..neverending..Ed please , is it possible a handpan version? ⛩️💠🫶🙏

Pandemic days
You have beautiful eyes  Your energy is inspiring  I'm suspicious of saying this  I like you so much   You know those people who come to add value?  You made me become a good man  That's why every day of my life  I never tire of saying I love you
♥️♥️
Amazing voice 😊👍🌹👁️🌞😯💞
I like the A version better. This one's in B, you can see him struggling to reach some notes, it's very subtle but the A one rocks. Not sure why he'd make either choice.
Theres no one who can do this better he is the best he gives fans the best of him
Proof that you do not need many and sophisticated, complex chord progressions to make good music.
Should definitely learn song 🤍 it's really beautiful
I'm glad to exist in time while he is alive. Blessed indeed
❤

Acustic live is better! Thanks so much for this precious song!🫶
You’re amazing. Kisses from France❤
I love Acoustic Live. and I love this song. Thank you so much, Ed❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This guy is so generic and unpopular, he's playing the Yaamava theater before he's 60 years old.  That's gotta be a new record for live-act obsolescence.
Afterglow

We need an acoustic version album/EP of his new hits.
I m watching again and again million times... trying to guess the chord progression??
if they play this in my burial, I will wake up just to listen to it for the last time.
Super schöner Song 🙃🙃🙃💙💚🧡 Danke
I feed like Ed makes any song he sings sound like he wrote it.
I bet the Iron & Wine song playing was Naked As We Came.

I love this song, and i was amazed by his voice; i just loved it 🥺🥺💕💕💕
The only "afterglow" you should be listening to is the original by the Small Faces. Check ot out on Ogdons Nut gone flake.
Ed gets better and better every song 🎵
If Ed Sheeran was a cover artist, he would still make it.
😍👏👏
ed-sheeran is never wrng singer .. his song is really nice and I can imagine it
I love this one more thank autotune version
Can we get an advanced tutorial plz 🙏
The best version of this song!
Take Love From Bangladesh Ed....
Goosebumps all around

Del rasgueo
Me cuesta aprender el ritmo
i find comfort in his songs
💜💌
Acredito que seja o músico do momento sem dúvidas alguma , e músicas que ficarão para sempre .. diferentes de hits que são instantâneo no cenário hoje ...
Я считаю, он велик, возможно генийпесня завораживает
Soooo schön das Lied von Ed Sheeran. 👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️❣️

On the single release he sounds more like a storm trooper than himself. This acoustic take is great.
Unico!
L💜VE IT🎶💜🎶

Anyone else love ED to Release a CD of ALL Versions of AFTERGLOW ?? It's just SO Beautiful❤ I listen to all on repeat for hours❤
Hey Ed,  if you might read this: Fu##in brilliant Songwriting, I am a Hardrock Fan but this is so cool. Lovit.
Just a guitar and he sounds better than an entire band.
One like for Ed ❤️ and his evergreen voice
Amazing Perfect ❤️🇧🇷
https://youtu.be/IOGgOYwj2mQ
😍😍😍
🎶🎶
I love this song but it's funny to me the fact that he is using 3 chords xddd
This is gorgeous
Absolutely love this song it's so haunting and beautiful
Nice song, I also love Everglow by Coldplay goosebumps
And we now know he and Cherry went to Antartica and Cherry got pregnant there and this song is about her being pregnant and waiting for their child to be born. They struggled to conceive and were just starting testing to see why when she got pregnant. This makes the song a whole lot sweeter and meaningful!
You are the best ❤️
Me encantan muchas de las canciones de Ed Sheeran. Pero Afterglow no es que me guste… es que me quedaría a vivir dentro de esta canción!! ☺️
God. That was beautiful.
Ed Sheeran. The Arijit singh of English music.

最高……ありがとうございます。
Ed should just get those outs!  His voice mixed to his guitar is fabulous! All of his acoustics are better then what we hear on cd/radio!•
After all his songs, I still loved this so far
I swear everytime i hear his songs i stop whatever im doing and  my eyes open so big hearing his voice.... His voice is so puree
Please come to North Carolina us 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💙 would cry
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ntah mengapa, karya Ed Sheeran selalu bagus, mudah-mudahan suatu saat bisa bertemu dengan Ed Sheeran
Many ppl say Ed is blessed to have such talent but we are more blessed to hear his songs❤
Love you man! The Afterglow is so strong! Man from me to you! So sorry for your loss in your best man! We all wish we had our Visiting Hours…
Love this song well done Ed
❤STILL So Beautiful ❤🍒❤=💖 ❤X❤X❤X
"coffee in your hair" > "coffee in your hand"
♥️
I love this song! Makes me feel warm inside! Wish the acoustic was the original style. 😊
This is by far the best version of this song. EXACTLY how it should sound. That weird chorus or echo effect in many versions…ruins it for me. Ed Sheehan alone in a room with a guitar, that’s how magic is made.
Just amazing..
Il y a pas de mots pour décrire cette voix ce talent juste magnifique ❤❤👌
Nude … soul… the one ❤️
Top 20 Songs by Ed Sheeran - watch in my channel 🙏
No friends to turn to Yeah, I messed up that
Only this man can come back after a year and half and heal us with his music...  Try changing my mind...
Awesome :)
If y’all think this is good you should see his you need me man I don’t need you videos.
I have and will never listen to anything more beautiful.  This song brings me so much peace and happiness, thank you
Oh… I thought it was a Taylor swift cover lol

Chills. This acoustic version gives me chills. His voice, everything is on point

Hope you will see this text one day .  my lips  smile even in pain whenever i remember those memories. even for a moment itself i had got life with smile my days were in your embrace i had spent my nights in your shades today when i remember those moment those moments force me to forgot all my sorrows
😌
I finally found a singer that doesn't need autotune! Its only been 2 and a half years...A while
listened 20 seconds to the original version and i was sure the acoustic version is much better. Ten seconds into this one and my opiniongot confirmed.
Class 🎶💕
So beautiful ❤️
the lyrics fits perfectly to our current situation. i close my eyes listening to it, its peaceful
I have two emojis and three words for this song...       Words-beautiful...just beautiful  Emojis-❤❤
He's a musical GENIUS 🌿♥️🌿

Y como por arte de magia, la tía dura que soy se va a la porra 😂😂😂 gracias Ed, esta te la guardo 😎
Ed I have an original song, but I turn on the video and listen because the live performance is a million times better. Your voice is incredible, no, it's the best
I can't believe you have 1.6k dislike
when you use 4 chords without even moving your hands to any fret and you create a beautiful music like this, that's talent.
cool ^_^
He could get a barritone Ukulele, he could do the same thing with half of the effort.
I’ve never been so happy to be flipped off for 3 minutes straight
Ваащее да та ки нет сло...
want more of this... such a talented vocalist.. and oh god damn what a writer :''')))
Very Nice play guitar Ed Sheeran love u❤️🙏
Beautiful rendition.  Love the acoustic version way more then the studio recording  😍😍😍
One of your best😄
There's no better performance than just singing to an acoustic. There's just more soul to it.
I can tell I love Ed by not saying I love Ed
beautiful noises, my red haired friend
Ed please talk about the audio equipment,
He sang for 3 minutes straight
That was excellent !
Agree or not but acoustic version is more beautiful
Eres el mejor! Tu voz y una guitarra, suenas espectacular!
Nicht zu überbieten. Wow. Was ein Sänger.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is way better than the weird one
https://youtu.be/qk68FcntHTI
Perfect as usual
Please come to Australia, Ed. I'll buy 10 tickets just for two people. I don't care.
Man this song is evergreen and never becomes old.
Simplesmente amo de  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Goosebumps

Greeting from Indonesia
Masterpiece ...!🔥❤️
His songs aleways are better in live version
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🥰
Stupenda!!!
I love this song more each time I listen to it.
This song only has four chords. NOT his best song.
His best friend Taylor Swift has a different song called Afterglow as well.
If you be unhappy, Ed make you a little bit lucky or some more. Thank you so much for your music
Ed sheeran has always made me happy, he just naturally always seems so happy and positive
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's amazing how these kinds of simple chords can be used and still dominate in writing a good song.  Maybe one day I can do that. problem is,  I can't sing like you Ed  : )
Omg
Mds 😱
I love this song 🥰❤️
*GENTEEEEEEEEEEE ESSE É O  ED SHEERAN  😍😍😍 MARAVILHOSO*
Nice guy~ korea suwon man good luck
Fabuloso, nunca decepcionas. 👍👍

Those stretch marks on his guitar tell a lot of stories
I Didnt Know Ron Can Even Sing
We love you Ed 💖. (From Philippines 💖)
😊
UGLY
I call Ed my Ginger Lover!!! Only man, besides Brandon Herrera(because he makes badass guns), that  I would ever marry just so I could hear his voice every day!!! And I don't even believe in love or marriage! 😁
Stop the clock, you're amazing, Mr. Ed Sheeran.😘😍😊
Насолода для моїх вух ❤️❤️❤️
I get that he is a little ugly but that doesn't make him any less talented, just like how being pretty doesn't make sm1 a good singer
This is called real king of singer, This is called legend, There’s no auto tune, There’s only  golden voice tune,  This voice is our heart medicine,✌🏼🙏🏻❤️💐
It took Bocelli for me to find you. Perfect by Ed Sheeran singing with Bocelli is epic. Most beautiful song I have ever heard. You, Ed are a treasure to us mere mortals.❤
From morroco 🇲🇦 ❤️🔥 Nice music 🎶💕😍

easy song to play on guitar!!
Can we appreciate the fact that the acoustic version is exactly the same as the studio version? This is what I call a real talent, Ed is probably the best singer and musician I've ever heard.
Why is everyone taking about bts?
Me gusta más acapella, se oye mejor la voz que en el videoclip
Bro where are you now?
Mmmmnnhh laaaaaanweiiilig.

Ed can you do cover or duet with Nightbirde's original song called "It's Ok". I just saw her at AGT. It would be beautiful 👍
Super good !!!!0😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😇🤗😇🤗🤗🤗😍
I went to ed's concert in 2019 in kuala lumpur. Best live performer with only a guitar! How i wish we can have concert again!

Hola soy latino busco rusa
I love Ed Sheeran!! I started playing the guitar because he inspired me! I am really good at Perfect
probably the best part in today’s music business everything sung purely from the soul
What the fuck, you are the best Ed.
Could this human being any more beautiful 🥰 Thank you for sharing your gift with us.
Just the best❤❤
This is out of the subject,  Save yourself and pray that God will forgive you for your sins. Dear God, I know I’m a sinner, and I ask for your forgiveness. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. I believe that He died for my sin and that you raised Him to life. I want to trust Him as my Savior and follow Him as Lord, from this day forward. Guide my life and help me to do your will. I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen. God forgives your sins through the sacrifice of Christ. And enjoy a clear conscience, eternal life, forgiveness, and fellowship with God.

Closing his eyes when he sings. I used to get mocked for that, but now I realised, that is when someone is truly connected with music.
I can barely hear you guitar
Ed Sheeran looks like a cross between Chucky and an albino turtle.

Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your head A million colours of hazel, golden and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing, Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Let's bring it back Ed, this is it.
This is the Song you hear When you are walking through next Or h&m
🙏🙏🙏🙏How are you sir? Sir God is one. He created this universe. Maybe science hasn't discovered it yet. Maybe discover in the future. Because science has not yet discovered 99% of the universe. And now science believes that anything we  discover is science. And God is not like man. There is nothing like it. He is like her. And man can never be God. And Jesus was not God. He was human. And the religion of God is Islam. Islam means obedience to one God.🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🙏🙏🙏
love you madly from kerala
It is an amazing!
Its so beautiful
정말좋아요.

Magical voice loved it
Allah. There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory) ❤️
Hope the musician Ed Sheeran, Make songs like thinking out loud , Perfect , Photograph ,😢
Elevated to where the angels sing with the earth !!
We love you.
Why is everybody hating Ed Sheeran now for what hes done in the past? Funny how they preach for change but does not believe in it. Teddie learned already so why bring it up again. Teddie is one of the greatest and no one can change my mind.
Fantastic Song and Performance !!!
I still dont get why he is being hated. Can someone give me the context?
Hey tartaglia
without auto tune still the best 💗
I hear Gingers are getting laid more often than ever since Ed became Ed Sheeran lol...he said that on one of his interviews a while back lol...
Do you know the group Now United? If you don't know, I recommend listening to all of their songs, they are very good. It has an American representative in it
⚘Everyone STILL here ??⚘ ❤Loving ALL 3 Versions❤ ⚘On REPEAT of course !!!⚘ ⚘❤Just BEAUTIFUL ED❤⚘ 🍀Stay safe ALL💚🍃🐨🌿💚xx

Is Ed flipping us the bird the whole song?
Love you from Egypt 🔥❤️💥

I think this is better than the regular version. The other version has so many layers that it sounds auto tuned, but this is just Ed's amazing natural voice and a guitar. Perfection.
Everything he sings becomes pure Gold ♡
The most talented, most hardworking, most inspirational, most amazing person on the earth. His voice melts like a chocolate🍫🤍
I really love afterglow, it's one of my favorates at the moment! I actually just uploaded a cover of this song :) That's how much I love this song! Anyways, I wish you guys all the best in whatever you are doing❤

Ed Sheeran sung. Autotune: why do I feel so useless?!
Ed Sheeran is the 🐐 for me❣️
His voice is amazing even without music  😍
I wonder how you can create a masterpiece of music, feeling and energy that reaches our hearts and brain since the first play, just with your simple guitar and voice. The secret is you’re a pure talent and you’re so smart to try not to change your nature even if tempted by mane dynamics of the music world and market. Yours will be my first concert as soon the pandemic will end, hope really soon
I Love It is the Beautiful song ever😭💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖🧡💗💞💞💕💕💌💌💘💕💝
Perfect song！🥒🥒

The BEST
For those commenting saying Ed is talented.. yes he is, however he struggled for years, grinding, writing songs every day, & couch surfing before he ever got a shot at fame. I think it's key that we hear things like this, because for most people it was years in the making. He played shows 6x/week for 4 years before landing his first big opportunity. Talent is a piece of the puzzle, but will never outlive hard work & dedication. ❤️✌️
❤
Good
i will hold on tight to the after glow verse two autotune: ummmmm well i guess i'm not wanted here
I just watched James Taylor play 'Fire and Rain' on acoustic guitar. Shits all over Sheeran as a guitarist.
Amazing

Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your head A million colours of hazel, golden and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing, Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I  We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Te acuerdas cuando ARMY te uso como nuestro boyfriend por que BTS puso a Halsey como su Chica Oficial después de meses atrás a ver dicho que ARMY era su novia y que no se preocuparan por tener novias y que nos traicionaron haciendo eso? Por que yo si 🥲😂😭💩🤡
Loveeee ❤️
You know what I really like about this? You can tell this isn't pre recorded with effects, or a "performance video" or whatever. It's raw, real, and it makes it so much more powerful. It's hard to find stuff these days that isn't someone lip syncing over a perfect recording in pro tools with a faded sunset in the background. Thanks Ed x
Congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment
Best musician ever! Love this song
Oq foi sou velha mais dou uma canja kkkkkkkk
Lindíssimo🥵💋💋💋💋
CHILE KNOWS HOW TO SING OMFG

Just beautiful 💋
He’s back, cool
I dont unverstand how you can destroy the normal Version of this song this acoustic Version sounds so much better
What’s the point in al of us watching it, when we all know the result of it (days/hours before it’s aired) sing off.   Same thing series after series, same thing, (Voice sing off) we all know Olly sexist against women Olly states, keeps on stating when a woman sings (it’s not what I’m looking for) ie a woman singer.  Not when a man singer sings a song (Olly doesn’t state nor say that) that’s sexist from Olly.  It’s suppose to be done on the Voice, your Voice, not gender,  Olly have men singers sing off against women singers (well Olly already stated) it’s not what I’m looking for (a woman singer)  (SO WE ALL KNOW FREAKIN RESULT)   Olly puts through 2 men singers (who a shout, and b shout out of tune) and stubs the 2 women singers who a nail there song and b smash it.   Same for Anne knowing a man singer, cas going to put him through, and stubs the woman singer who nails it, smashes it, which happens,   Poor man singer who shouts, sings out of tune gets put through. (Solely because he’s a man) and this happens series to series on the Voice sing off,  Girls and Boys sing off, 5 boys winners. (5 boys stated the winner of the sing off)  What a fix that was, poll has been done over it, on average 86% of people (per singer, per singer thought the girl/woman was the better singer who should have gone through)   Yet judges fixes it up to make poorer man singer go through.   Another thing public don’t know, often very often on precious series of the Voice they would put 2 powerful Female singers together (solely on the basis of getting rid of one powerful female singer, and solely on the basis of putting more men through)   The Voice shouldn’t treat women singers like dirt and trash like it does.   Girls boys sing off, 56 boys won, only 38 girls won. (That’s 65% for boys, and 35% for girls) ridiculous that is from you judges.   Women and men, both have very very good voices, stop making the Voice into a gender based, fixing and making us know the result of it.   By the beginning of the Voice, should turn for people/women who smash they song, and not turn for poor performance.  And at the sing off stop making it gender based (it should be done on the voice) not gender, you wouldn’t have it the other way around (would you Anne) 56 girls wins and only 38 boys wins.   So then stop making it gender based (also another thing) in early series judges used to turn around 4 chairs time after time, that hardly happens now (due sadly due to the fix)
Love this Song
He's vocal is so cool grate beautiful and he is my favourite singer
Official acoustic video more like official autistic video hahahahahaa Ed Sheeran is a big pile of antilope poo <3
It takes a ton of talent to play 2 open chord capo songs.
Eres la dulzura  en voz
Mi querido Ed 💕 tienes las voz más hermosa 💖

I LOVE YOU ED SHEERAN❤ Brasil 🇧🇷
I don't know who will see this, but when this song came out last December, it also happened to be the 10th anniversary of Bon Iver's Blood Bank in the same year (one of my favourite songs of all time). I've been a longtime fan of both artists and both songs, I arranged, recorded, and just posted my mashup of the two! I'd love to know what you think if you're interested in giving it a listen😊 Cheers!!
You Perfekt !!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
To be honest ed sheeran looks like christoph from frozen
Thanks for uploading! If you have a second, I posted a cover of Jason Isbell. As a fellow music lover, I'd love if you'd check it out. It's on my channel. Hope you like it!

Oh shit, here we go again ❤❤❤
Lyrics: Look, I was gonna go easy on you Not to hurt your feelings But I'm only going to get this one chance Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes) Just a feeling I've got Like something's about to happen But I don't know what If that means what I think it means We're in trouble, big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say I'm not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough To slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot But for me to rap like a computer It must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC In the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts While I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin' a rough time period Here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody wants the key and the secret To rap immortality like Ι have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!) MCs get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church And burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in Is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think it's all a game 'Til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-lookin' boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face Lookin' boy (Ha-ha!) You're witnessin' a massacre Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy? I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy I'ma work for everything I have Never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face, lookin' boy! Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause— I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racin' around the track Call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin You rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off, then I'm reloadin' Immediately with these bombs, I'm totin' And I should not be woken I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head A zombie floatin' But I got your mom deep-throatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin' in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm And pay homage, pupil It's me, my honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't Utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this Chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoah Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' To censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9 See if I get away with it now That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal! And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while he played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!" Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman? Innovative and I'm made of rubber So that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me And it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience A feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music "Oh, he's too mainstream." Well, that's what they do when they get jealous They confuse it "It's not hip-hop, it's pop, "—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it "I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use." Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these S that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too? Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do What I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues But it's still tongue-in-cheek fuck you I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz Still "Chunky but Funky" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils And here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard — Be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a God?
Love u
..
WOW
i love you moe than everything
League of his own.
I Love you 🎸
The world's favourite ginger has done it again
This is way better than the original cut - really highlights how good Ed’s voice is. Love the ‘live at Abbey Road’ version of I Don’t Care too. This man is incredibly talented.
Wow...so cool  Amazing  Great 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Illuminati confirmed buong video naka "pak u" lang sya sa gitara habang inaaliw nya kayo hahahaha
only three persons in the whole world blows my mind with their voice JB ED and N.Jonas
I'm currently we're the same age he's 32 I'm going to be turning 33 in March
Tom macdonald is low budget but not many helpers besides his girlfriend filming him he's coming up there with you and you're doing the Grammys I still love his music even though it's got a girlfriend
I love this song ❤️ 😍
He needs to get a better keyboard
such talent
Só o Ed Sheeran pra me fazer chorar sem eu saber a tradução da música.😭
Much better than the official version. No effects and no better Ed than guitar and voice
Thought there was a Dsus4 in this sondg but Ed didn't one at all in this version. 🤔
all this dude literally needs is an acoustic guitar and he can make masterpiece songs
Just so we're straight I already know you're married I'm using you as a vent as well as many other artists as events so if I don't I'm going to blow up and wind a good prison like my daddy I don't need that and I always like to your acoustics anyway so long distance throw invisible ball and keep it at a friendship level
SIMPLY AMAZING ED!!! ❤❤❤
I Love you 🎸
A TRUE LEGEND
Wow can u plz one day sing a gospel song cz I really love all your songs
Good things happen to good people. The Lord has blessed you for sure!🤗

unbelievable, such talent.
A Guitar lesson and a performance all in one! Beauty Ed :)
🎶♥️🎶
E
Muchas gracias 💕
I just LOVE his voice. Liquid gold.
I would years ago but I can't afford and you don't always have to do live either when you do that on your own free time when you feel like it then goes for anyone else that's already in my list of YouTubes to Pandora and other musical apps that's considered alumni everyone could have their break from everyone else there's always that time when someone needs it that time time out to get away from drama stress other things like depression anxiety those are the two main things for me and everyone thinks I'm in the nutcase now I'm the normal one and the nicer one and I already missed one of my nephews left already he's with Grandma it's Isaiah on his dad's side but I still have the other two here Jose is at work it's Anthony's dad and I think Julia is asleep cuz she probably came in about 4:00 in the morning from work and the other two grandparents which is my mom and stepdad Tom should be upstairs if not times at work I family healthcare as a security guard I still have to save them from breaking his own rib though from other people
The best singer of pop
Check my cover

It's beautiful 👌👍👍
He is the nicest guy in the world
I just made a LOOP cover of this. Check it out, thx guys 👍🤩🤩
Anthony was actually a pretty happy child today along with the other two which is Isaiah and Zack he did well today on the bright side I didn't slip and fall in that wet floor that Zack was mopping up or trying to anyways he's only five had to put his shoes back on him with your Spider-Man shoes has he had me drawing two little cakes and a money thing suitcase he only lost one pencil which is good no big deal they're cheap I got them from Dollar tree anyway probably get some more coloring books though so they have more of a selection as well as for me get more colors probably a few more books too normal ones not what's up in the air cuz I don't always have the money I'm perfectly fine with money without money for now I'll figure it out later got to do paperwork anyways like SSI for one for my dyslexia and my other problems but I never hear voices in my head I just get really bad depression and anxiety in those doctors were dumb when I was in the ER too and that box they had me in had no air circulation I almost died in it I really have really heavy hair and thick and I didn't like the fact all laughed at me either especially when I named it registered nurse that's what bothered me the most cuz Brianna Deborah is actually a registered nurse and she owns many care homes in this town we need a few more in this town to accommodate the ones that are currently here we don't have enough homes for them all for the ones that can live on their own cuz they are capable too with the other workers or another person that's with them personally and I'll take my meds here in a little bit anyways it's about that time before I go to bed and I'm not making anyone into a duplicates I'm also not taking anyone's credit either that's their own
Still the best ❤

WOOW 😻 YOUR VOICE ARE AMAZING 😻👌👌
The brilliance in this man.  I knew first hand that this song reminded me of Iron and wine before even listening to the lyrics.  And he’s paid homage to Iron and Wine.  Just absolute brilliance.
Would love to have a Guinness with Ed! Great talent.
Loving both versions of this song
Ed Sheeran  Love your video.  Gwenaelle Noval (only 16 years old) nailed this song, nailed it. One of the best vocal to date.   Yet no chairs turn.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAMbPriQto  And Olly Murs, stated this.  It's not what I'm looking for. (ie a woman singer) think it's disgusting from him.
Ich Liebe deine Lieder
I love this. So beautiful. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
love it
If no one told you this yet, I just wanna say Thank You Edward for Everything you've produced till date with your heart in it I'm certain of it! These acoustics mean the world to some of us...

Tamilan any one like here....👍
OMG 😍
Big fan from INDIA
We as a citizen of Myanmar not agree with the current move and would like to request the world leaders. UN and the world medias help our country- our leaders- our people - from this bitter acts.  We want democracy and want our country to develop as our nabouring countries.   #savemyanmar
Please stand with the people of Myanmar. We don't want military leadership. It would be a huge setback and a serious blow to our democratic reforms in Myanmar.   They cut out our phone lines and internet access this morning. We don't know when it will happen again. They have detained our leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other ruling party politicians. So please spread our voices and stand with us in fighting for our democracy.   #SaveMyanmar #Myanmar #WeDoNotWantMilitaryLeadership  #WeWantDemocracy
Oh gosh! Goose bumps!!
Pow! Your voice is a miracle!!! , it's incredible to sing like this, congratulations Ed!
This is one of the songs where it goes like: listen, repeat, listen, repeat 🔁
And my baby sister really does listen to almost a lot of your music as well several others it's already on YouTube with their own copyrights and alumni
Amanda Gonzales
Pop my mom's profile I have to deal with cops tomorrow hopefully he goes good and I get my phone back and slowly get the other stuff taken care of but my teeth are finally feeling better though that's a good thing I really do hope I get my phone I really need it

Trust in Jesus alone for salvation! Don't go to hell! " They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matt 13: 42"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."  "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."Acts 4:12 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." Matt 7:21 Be born again, repent and believe the gospel!! Jesus is coming back soon!!! www.fullyfreefilms.com

TRUST ME i hate when people promote their covers on others videos too but how else will others hear it or know? I’d say just give it a chance just like someone gave ED a chance🤗 He once used to sing on the streets of England and now look at him!!! Please give it some love💛 and share share share, like, and leave a comment to let me know what you thought. 🦋🌄🌞🦋✨ https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/sFB33YSFDTgt6cXG9

It blows my mind how a talented man with a guitar can amaze me more than an entire band. You're one of a kind, Ed. Thank you for sharing your talent with us.
There is no one like him I swear, he is truly amazing!
@Ed Sheeran I don't have enough of vocal range to do justice for your amazing song Idol. Still I've made a cover as an inspiration after my wife and daughter survived from pandemic few weeks ago. While looking after them I've made the recording then later the music video when the snowy day comes.
An amazing song. Really gave me shivers
Thank you Lord for the gift of Ed.  Life is much brighter!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
awesome🙌
It's better then the original one...
Plisee Creating New Music I'm I Like and I Love Your Music Is A Good 👍👍
📀Astonishingly raw and powerful, made even more stark by the almost matter of fact tone!!!👍
You think after dropping so many good songs, and writing so many good songs for other artist he would run out of good ideas, but he does not...  Great song and looking forward to your future music :)
The celebrities who do not make it to the newspapers and the news websites are the ones who are actually successful and the best in thier field Ed Sheeran is one of them You're my favourite and always will be
me encanto
un crack
Ed Sheeran writes such beautiful songs. I swear I just get lost in the lyrics and melodies and have to bring myself back to earth. Love this new one!
Probably the greatest artist of all time and for the rest of time!

Me encanta :)
めっちゃ好き！！
Your skin isn’t paper. Don’t cut it. Your face isn’t a mask. don’t cover it. Your neck isn’t a hanger. Don’t hang it. Your life isn’t a film. don’t end it.  You’re not pretty. Because you’re beautiful. The world doesn’t have a place for you. because the world has a special place for you. No one likes you. because we all love you. You don't want to die, you just want the pain to end.  The world can be cruel but you are strong. There is only one you in this universe. You’re special in your own way. That’s what makes you different. Being different isn’t a bad thing. It shows that you are more creative than the ones that judge you for who you are. You might not be pretty on the outside. But you’re beautiful on the inside. You might feel useless, but little do you know you have something the rest of us dont. God brought you here for a reason. You have a mission to complete in this world. The ones who judge you, are teaching you something. They are teaching you not to be like them. Stay strong.    I know probably no one will read this, but if you do, whatever happens, don’t let anyone EVER take your happiness away

You can hardly hear the guitar. And his voice. But a good mic would’ve helped.
I LOVE 💕💖
Anyone else have to stop the video to take in those voice riffs??? 😧😱🤭 LIKE, OKAY ED I SEE YOU!!!
Thank you Ed, you are the best...
I love it.
He doesn't need nothing, only his voice and a guitar and he can make you crying and dreaming.
Is anybody there listening to this great song right now?  I'm almost crying. I miss you desperately.
I love this song so much and I am singing it out loud

Not that Ed Sheeran will see this but i think that Ed Sheeran and Brendon Urie should collab on a song together if you hate me for saying this then, I'm sorry.

THERE IS GRACE AND MERCY STILL BEFORE YOU, ACCEPT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND DO NOT GET LEFT BEHIND   Since the day Adam and Eve rebelled against God, we owe God since we are born. The Bible explains what sin has cost us and what heavy penalty we have.   Romans 5:12 ¹²Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:   This says that because of sin death has entered into the world not just that; it says here why sin is a result of death:   Romans 6:23 ²³For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. We owe God, it's like a reaccuring debt, we can't help but sin and with each sin no matter how great or small; it builds up and all is judged and is cast into the lake of fire, for all sin is punished according to their works.   But here is the best part, God sent is only begotten son, Jesus Christ, who through his sacrifice made it possible for sin to be forgiven because we fall short of the glory of God, through his grace and mercy he is offering it as a gift of eternal life. But here's the part where everyone gets confused, everyone will stand before the throne of God and all shall give an accountant to what they have done.   If not repented, you shall be cast into everlasting fire. Jesus said that:   Ephesians 2:8-9 ⁸For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: ⁹Not of works, lest any man should boast.   There you have it people, everyone has a chance of being saved, everyone has a choice if they want to be saved or continue in sin to rebel against God. But remember in your rebellion in the end is death and punishment for scripture says in:   Revelations 21:8  ⁸But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.   Be saved, receive Jesus for his second coming is so soon, it is at your doorstep, Jesus said what must take place before his second coming and these things have already happened and continue to, take this time now to repent and accept him.   Call upon the name of Jesus Christ and you shall be saved   Father, forgive me for I am a sinner, I have sinned greatly and in need of a saviour, please forgive me (all known and unknown sins). I believe that Jesus is the only begotten son of God, I believe that he suffered and died on the cross for my sins and I believe that he rose from the dead on the third day, accept you as my personal lord and saviour, come into my heart and give me a new one. I trust you and put my trust in you alone, with all my strengthand mind, heart and spirit I put my faith and trust in you alone.   Praise our God, the lord of lords and the king of kings.
👍💛🔥💛👍

Wow...einfach großartig!!! ❤🤗❤

Me gusta mucho ✍️
this song consist of 2 chord only
His voice can end a war.
2:23 he messes up but completely makes up for it with a small run right after and I honestly prefer it so much more than the original. It adds color and variation and just sounds incredible.
that voice is all we need rn
Can’t wait for your album!!!!
Wonderful
Love u💗
I prefer this version, so much natural
Awesome Performance, Some Powerful Words. Well put together. Keep hanging in there Bro. We'll get through anything, We're Canadian!

Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden, and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  [Verse 2] The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Ed has such a beautiful voice I prefer him acoustic, production just distracts from his angel voice
So dont worry you can explain it  always  you are real talented person
On the world we have a mess and we are the mess we doing the mess and inside we have sometomes mess that what you are showing in your last songs  meaning  perfectly unperfection this is all about
We are not petfect no one is and that is individual objections about this  last your songs and texts  strange but this shows your tslen about singing at all is easy to build up easy songs meaning and sing is hard to show that may be stupid words but words are sometimes stupid  especislly from people what are two faces or not perfect  like a world we living in.

I think I want to show you in words they are words they are meaning something different but you can put insteda sound same that is a paradox of english language they can sound same they have dfferent meaning but can meaning exactly same if you pronounce the words in song isnt it strange different word but csn mean same olin song even mean different thing that is what world shoul know wez are jot perfec and like in this what I want to show is about.but I would not twist words one again never again it was because wotld is not orrfect and peole are not prerfect have two faves to show that opposit way in it thats the thing really genius thing mean
nice guitar :'( ♥♥♥
He's the bestttt !! I can still remember the feeling when I went to his concert for the first time. Totally amazing !
I love you, Ed
Af, coisa linda

I feel like this guy when I smoke weed https://youtu.be/oAjDI7cCqP4
Great 👍, real great use of descriptive wording with fine flow too, have you put on new image of yourself?, it looks real good, so lovely you look!!! God bless...!!! "We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle, Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow, So alone in love like the world had disappeared, Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go, I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow, And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears"!!!♥♥♥
Welcome back to the king of soft pop!
Hello everyone! 2020 ended with one of the greatest presents - new Ed's song. And it is truly amazing. After listening to Afterglow for the very first time, I was sure I'm gonna do a cover of it. And I'm really glad this is the first video of mine in 2021. As always, it would be pretty cool if some of you could check it real quick, cause this really means a lot to me. Thanks for your attention and let this year be the best you have had yet!
Introduced him to my boyfriend. Now he is addicted to Ed! 💖 We will love if you release a new album, Ed! We’ll wait for it 🙏🏻
👍⚘❤ED'S BRILLIANT & The World's BEST⭐History set in Stone👍CONGRATS on UK No.1❤⚘Come on Aussies, No.1 here too💚🍃🐨🌿💚xx

My great nanna died and her song was supermarket flowers now I listen to it all the time when I listen to it I cry your also so talented I saw your cosert I was 5 when I saw your concert now I'm 8 my name is Charli rose Phillips I love your songs
Ed Has a talent of writing songs that you feel like youre supposed to know. Like it doesnt feel like youre listening to new music to see if you like it or not. Its a given that youll like it. And youre SUPPOSED to know it. Something really special about this guy. Cant wait until covid fucks off and he comes back to sydney.
Love you ed from south korea!
50 points to Gryffindor
What a glorious voice and a majestic talent
I have a fingerstyle guitar video 💕
Its great to have you back Ed. Take care of you and your family.
When we all thought that music will not redeem us from 2020. Then here comes Ed Sheeran. Saving us. Gracias Señor.

I guess saying dearest Ed is too familiar but hell with it, what do we have if we do not have interpersonal connection?  I think as humans we have all learned we need each other, family, friends, God, and yes, the artists through which the uncreated light of God is caught in glimpses if we just close our eyes and listen.  Dearest Ed, thank you for sharing with us.  What else can one say?  God bless you.

You are so popular because you are an image to everyone of real, you are not the best looking (red and boy next door kind of) but you are nice from the inside out . A guitar a song a tune from the boy next door truth is though we laugh in the face of commercial you have spent a year with your wife and your child you now come back to the bigger world but if the world crashed down you will hold on to your wife and your child not your guitar because you are a real person and that is what we recognise and that is why your songs and your livelihood sells anyway.  You are a good representative of my family.
This version is more natural, love it
This man is the proof, that there are amazing musicians out there, who don't need autotune at all! And he is the damn leader of them!
🌹🌹🌹🌹
Te amoooo💜
I love you! 😠💛
Guitar pick:exist Ed: we don't do that here
Bonjour très belle chanson ❤❤
Je vous souhaite une bonne année 2021et une bonne santé pour  vous et  votre famille ❤❤
Bonjour de la France
You made me cry
So much comments but no lyrics ... 😂  great song as usual ❤️🥰
Love it...Ed
I thought this was a cover of the driver era, afterglow :((
T A L E N T O
Love the feels that I get while listening ♥️
I'm so curious as to what made these people dislike the video... seriously what's there not to like about it?
Ed Sheeran pra presidente do 🇧🇷
I will come here every new year. Happy new year 2021
Ed super !!!😘🤩
absolutely perfect.
Лучший 💞
Wow my favourite song writer and favourite singer has made my day first time hearing this song and already in love with it please keep going ❤️
Amazing 👍
The chords
I knew it would be MUCH better wo the echo on the recording! Great song, record it like this!
Mr Sheeran why don't you make a collaboration with Adele, she's English you will find it or with a DJ like Coldplay
Beautiful
Lovely
Nice one
That seems to be a natural red  solid top  finish - acoustic guitar.               Either that or the red color that he dyes his hair with,   is also used on the guitar's top for something different.     🤫     🤔                        😃
One of the best singer all time💖 love from #Kashmir
Maravilhosoo
Got the vibes
Thank you for your beautiful thoughts that have condensended into beautiful songs for us to enjoy xx

Love this song especially the chorus❤❤
What better than listening to this when you're sad, it's like an emotional escape for me.
Amooooo 💓
All he needs is a guitar, then the magic happens 😌 Enjoyed so much more like this

“ Par conséquence, j’annonce au monde entier la suite d’une série de Châtiments, air terre et mer, de plus ce qu’ils ont comme effets du Châtiment de Coronavirus, jusqu’à ce qu’ils soumettent complètement au Khalifa choisi par Allah, Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani. Qu’avons-nous demandé de Savants Musulmans dans les mondes et tous ceux qui se divergent dans la religion parmi tous les gens, comme condition qu’accepter Allah en tant que Juge entre eux dans toutes leurs divergences religieuses ? En revanche, Le Khalifa d’Allah, Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani n’a que déduire Le Jugement d’Allah pour eux de la question à partir du Clair de Saint Coran. Sauf qu’ils se sont enflés d’orgueil à l’égard du Khalifa d’Allah et Son Livre -le Saint Coran- dont ils refusent à suivre et laisser tout ce qu’il s’oppose à l’écart. Tandis que je les appelle avec les mondes depuis quinze ans, et ils ne font que tourner le dos orgueilleusement au Khalifa d’Allah, au point de provoquer La Colère d’Allah vis-à-vis Son Livre. Et ils ne trouveront aucun échappatoire pour eux face au Châtiment d’Allah, sauf avec le repentir vers Allah en Lui suppliant de guider leurs cœurs pour suivre Le Prédicateur véridique de Leur Seigneur, Khalifa d’Allah sur terre et Son Serviteur Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani, et de se soumettre complètement à la sentence.”  • Écrit par : Al-Imam Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani | 29 Mai 2020  🔴Coronavirus et Le Bayane qui tranche loin de toute plaisanterie frivole..  • pour lire plus: ❗👇  https://www.mahdialumma.com/showthread.php?t=40163

Nicely done Ed, never cease to surprise me... stay safe!
Thanks
this song reminds me of a girl who sacrificed almost all her highschool years to be with me. We used to love each other very much but everything has come to an end, we broke up in the beginning of 2020. Now she is studying in Korea, the pandemic is still there. I really want to wish her to be safe and happy but im scared to text her. After a few times I texted her, she just replied with “ok”,”yes”. what should I do now :(  Although it’s been a year now but I still and always love her.
His back!!!
This guy forgot how to use condensor mic
Wunderschön!!!!!   Seine Stimme - wow!!!!
That vocal riff at 1:58 is so clean
Wonderful come back 👌👌
What a heavenly voice! Really soothes your soul.🥺💓
I love you. I love you so much.
Chords are perfect -- Giving the middle finger to 2020.

This guys acoustics are on a whole other level
Love, eyes, snow, winter, with soft and gentle melodies ... have always been Ed sharren's themes forever.  Cold at the beginning, but warm and happy for the ending.  It always makes us a little anxious, waiting, patient ... and then bring hope to all of us a wonderful live, beautiful love ... to erase the dark nights covered by Covid19.  A really lovely song, once again, as pretty as "Perfect"
Recuerden que afterglow no se le dedica a cualquier persona Hasta estar seguro de q sea la persona correcta.🥺💗
He's like a God to me🖤
O amor da minha vida
Muito lindo
Honestly wish he'd do more stuff in this medium. Less super produced and more intimate

Hi lovely Ed and my dear fellow fans!!! SORRY FOR BOTHER YOU BUT I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP. I'm just a person who's looking for job and i can't find one, so my last option was start a channel in Youtube, so if you can help me at least by suscribe, I'M NOT EVEN ASK YOU TO WATCH MY VIDEOS IF YOU DON'T WANT, but just suscribe and/or share, you'd be helping me a lot. Hope i can count with you :"). I'm trying so hard every day to learn how to make great content, to share all that i know with you all. :) Greetings from Argentina! P.S.: Thank you for such a beautiful song :")
I love this song amazing

Le Coronavirus et l’annonce du miracle de la guérison sans vaccin ou médicament .. 👇👇 https://www.nasser-mohammad.com/showthread.php?t=41472 👇👇 Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani 24 - Rabiïe II - 1442 09 - 12 - 2020 09:01 Matin (Selon le calendrier officiel de la Mecque) _______  Le Coronavirus et l’annonce du miracle de la guérison sans vaccin ou médicament ..  Au Nom d’Allah Le Tout Miséricordieux, Le Très Miséricordieux.  De la part du Serviteur d’Allah et Son Khalifa Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani à tous les gens. Ô gens, je suis Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad, je ne suis pas Le Khalifa d’Allah rien que pour le Yémen. Mais je suis Le Khalifa d’Allah pour le monde entier, et jurant par Allah qu’il n’y a aucune distinction entre yéménite ou chinois pour moi.  Ô chers Dirigeants des humains, Décideurs pour leurs populations, et à tout Homme majeur chez les Arabes et les Non-arabes, le Musulman comme le mécréant ! Écoutez et raisonnez en ce que nous allons émettre comme fatwa véridique (avis juridique) pour vous qui se base sur la parole qui tranche loin de toute plaisanterie frivole : Je jure par Allah, L’Un et Le Dominateur Suprême, que je ne savais pour vous aucun vaccin et aucun soin de ce qui est dans les poitrines du Châtiment d’Allah, à part que vous implorez Allah avec cette invocation sans orgueil à l’égard du Khalifa d’Allah, Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad. Quant aux mots pour dévoiler le Châtiment de ce que les poitrines contiennent, il faut s’adresser à Allah avec humilité pour Le supplier de la manière suivante :  « Ô Notre Seigneur, nous avons fait du tort à nous-mêmes. Et si Tu ne nous pardonnes pas et ne nous fais pas Miséricorde, nous serons très certainement du nombre des perdants » Et après la repentance ils faut qu'ils disent :  « Ô Mon Seigneur, je suis Ton Serviteur, je Te supplie par le fait qu’il n’y a aucune divinité en dehors de Toi, par la certitude de Ta Miséricorde dont Tu T’es prescrit à Toi-Même, et par L’Imense Délice de Ton Auto-Satisfaction qui est plus grand que celui de Ton Paradis, pour que Tu me guérisses du tourment de Coronavirus, ou Tu l’éloignes de moi. Car à présent, nous sommes croyants de ce que Ton Prêcheur prêche. Ô Notre Seigneur, repousse de nous Ton Châtiment de toute porte, afin de suivre la Voie de la Vérité venant de Toi, et que Tu nous affirmes pour tenir ce que nous T’avons promis Ô qui S’interpose entre l’Homme et son cœur ! Certes, nous n’avons que Ta Miséricorde dont Tu T’es prescrit à Toi-Même. Et si Tu ne nous pardonnes pas et ne nous fais pas Miséricorde, nous serons très certainement du nombre des perdants. Ô Mon Seigneur, Tu as dit en fait dans le Clair de Ton Livre :  {{ 60. Et Votre Seigneur dit : " Appelez-Moi, Je vous répondrai " }}. Parole Véridique d'Allah Le Tout Puissant . [ Ghafir : Le Pardonneur ]  وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ 60 صدق الله العظيم غافر  Alors de ma part, l’appel et le retour, puis de Ta Part, la Réponse. Car Toi, Tu ne manques pas à Ta Promesse. Notre Seigneur, Gloire à Toi et Ta Promesse est Vérité. Tu es Le Plus Miséricordieux. Ô Notre Seigneur, affirme nous pour tenir notre promesse envers Toi en suivant Le Prédicateur Mondial d’Allah, Le Khalifa d’Allah Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani. Ô Notre Seigneur, fais de sa venue une bénédiction pour nous et non une malédiction sur nous à cause de notre détournement de l’Appel véridique d’Al-Imam Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani ». ______   ..
I want my children to know you. Please grow very old.

Trzymajmy się mocno 💟

Nailed the singing!!!!!!!!!
Wunderschön
Lyrics: Stop the clocks it’s amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden and red Saturday morning is fading The sun’s reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  We were love drunk waiting on a miracle Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears  Oh I will hold on to the afterglow Oh I will hold on to the afterglow  The weather outside’s changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing, Iron & Wine This is a new dimension  This is a level where we’re losing track of time I’m holding nothing against it, except you and I   We were love drunk waiting on a miracle Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears  Oh I will hold on to the afterglow Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Who tf dislike this?

Such talent 💙 could listen to him all day
he's joining Adele now. drop one song, let it boom, then whoosh he's gone from the spotlight, but his songs remain more than a decade.
He just proves that only the years he is in is a good year .
I missed you 😭
Missu ❤
only acoustic guitar and Ed .... the end
He can change my mood within a sec♥
I love you so much. Thank you for your music. 😭😭😭
Gracias por tanto, Ed. Tus canciones sanan. Sos inmenso. ❤️
Thank you Ed. You are the best ❤️
I just gotta say it’s the csus2 that puts this song together ( those of who get me)
Those 30 seconds between 1.30 and 2 mins where he pushes his voice more is just perfect
You sing beautiful man <3
A lot of new singers but Ed Sheeran hits different!!

SHOW

Hi! This song is amazing! I thought his other songs were good but listening to this changing everything!
The year starts with this song.
Good start of the year.
me encanta !!!
You have always inspired me with your songs🤗💕
Are you you sick and tired of government's that don't give you intellect? Upgrade to peak intellect today. The Messiah equates to intellect in numerical terms. Numerology is not even from here because certain equations cause infinity. Nikola Tesla said he who could unlock the secrets of three, six and nine would unlock the secrets of the universe. It appears I have unlocked literally all the secrets. One divides into three, two divides into three, four divides into six, five divides into six, seven divides into nine, eight divides into nine. Each one causes infinity. So three, six and nine are the only numbers that cause infinity. This is why they are significant. It's part of the expansion of the universe. It is the division of magnetism because there is a zero in magnetism because the zero is balance. The universe is based on divide. That's how it causes time and space. What causes divide? Inequality of magnetism (zero gravity). The invisible force when you pull a magnet apart is called zero gravity. Hard drives are the opposite of brains, the internet is the opposite of the universe because it is electromagnetic memory mirroring itself in order to cause time and space. They are both the same because the universe operates on opposites. There is forgiving and pulling in magnetism, opposite polarity in electricity and opposite waves in sound. The universe causes opposites everywhere and on the Earth in the form of the degraded state. The internet is the degraded state of the universe. The computer is the degraded state of our brain, the computer monitor is the opposite of the invisible mirror of the universe in the degraded state. When you look into the computer, you are looking at the opposite of the natural reality.  It's artificial reality, the degraded state again. Elon Musk "created" Neuralink even though the universe forces everything through us. My natural singularity system is the opposite of the artificial singularity. Google is the consolidation of all information. The Messiah is the consolidation of all important knowledge. It just causes opposites everywhere. Is The Messiah Google? No, I am actually a human but we have to exit the old world into the new world where we are not even causing debt through a synchronized intellect system where everyone is on their phones and on my mark, we enter the new time realm where we are causing the natural singularity which causes infinity through synchronized will balancing. This is the only way to invest and we all HAVE TO invest. There is no way around it because infinite expansion of the wrong ideas and concepts is going to be put on the map everywhere. I think I have to work with Google to make this happen. The opposite of investing is infesting. All we ever do is infest nations with debt causation. I have to live in the forest soon because the entire world economy collapsed a year and three months ago. The species does not realize this. The cause of the system collapsing is the collapse of the bond market. We were bonded to ball and chain in the ancient days. This was the beginning of the force of electromagnetism. From there it went to coin and religion manipulation, and then to the next degraded state of paper bills and the final degraded state of electromagnetic memory and cryptocurrency.  The computers are our debased will. Why? Because there is no will power holding anything up anymore. Everything is becoming automated. The degraded state again. There is no intelligence in the entire triangular hierarchy system because dependence is the opposite of intellect. That means anyone within the pyramid is still dependent even though we think we are independent. There is some intelligence in independence but it's still zero. There is only absolute intelligence in synchronized balanced independence in not causing debt. There is no inherent monetary system to inherit and all nations are going to collapse like a rock very shortly. Why are we still causing debt in the year 2021 when we can mirror our debt off obelisks and sundials? We also need to create the universal human suit that ephemeralizes the entire stock market into a will balancing tool. We also have to mirror our parasitic nature off each other and time using the tools of balance. Why can't humanity realize what The Messiah is saying? I am trying to save the species. If you were wondering, I have autism spectrum disorder, PTSD and OCD all my life. This makes for a lot of foresight... so much that it hurts. If you would like to know how to invest, there is only one way. It's called synchronized will balancing.  We actually have to think about what we are putting on the land everywhere. We can't just put up anything we want. We have to install time on all the lands before infinite expansion crushes us. This can be done with obelisk's and sundial's. Also, we have to create the universal human suit that consolidates all the things we have to have to become a will balancer and not a debt causation human. We also need the tools of balance and to weigh the plant life and water sources in order to mirror ourselves exactly. When we are causing the same effect worldwide, we will have caused what is called the natural singularity. This is the only way to end unintelligence, anxiety, depression, the stock market and debt for all eternity. Have a nice day
Love love love love this song as all of your songs
💚💚🌌
the storytelling is really the soul of his music. it brings me somewhere that makes me feel deeply in love with someone. it's honestly wonderful.

"Afterglow"? Is that what happens after you take your Adrenochrome?
T amo
He should be awarded a Nobel Prize .
I'd like to start saying that i really like Ed Sheeran, i apreciate almost every song that he have released... But, honestly, with this particular acoustic exibition, more than one time, he sang really bad. He've missed a lot of high notes.
His voice is on another level...  His voice is so peaceful.... His voice is so relaxing...  His fingers flows along with the rhythm of his voice...  What else do you want...
eu amo!
Nice song
Por la cresta Ed, gracias

"WONDERFUL 👏👏👏👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟...🌟
Ed Sheeran is the only artist that I will never hate despite his never-ending usage of generic chord progressions
So honest and truthful. I think Ed Sheeran will be best if he does a mixture of songs like this (his original style) and songs like those in his Colab Project. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Ed bringing love back to 2021 <3
Voz  que emociona!❤
That's amazing 👏🏻
Iloveyou!
who's chopping onions? way to start my January <3
A imaginação é mais importante que a ciência, porque a ciência é limitada, ao passo que a imaginação abrange o mundo inteiro.  QUERIA BATER 1k PARA A AJUDAR minha família.
Why I always like it when he makes an acoustic version
Am waiting for it.
The fact that he’s able to write so many diverse and amazing songs with the relatively basic and similar chords is amazing
Amo suas músicas
Well, 2021 would be better.🥳🤚
Year 2021. It's great that things are back to normal, I've been waiting for him so long !
The best💙
Does anyone know what guitar he is playing?

Just Ed blessing our ears.

While I do think this young man IS beyond amazing. He is far o young to have EARNED the title that you bestowed upon him. Give him time. He may well EARN that designation.

One of the best musicians ever
He is playing a Sheeran guitar. Anyone knows which model exactly?
Just as awesome as every time, I literally cry when I hear his beautiful voice in a new song (or a new version). Sounds stupid but his music and talent really helped me out in hard moment so I will be forever greatful 🧡

# brother I have song for you ## ED
Perfeita, é pura poesia! Amanhecer Pare os relógios, é maravilhoso Você deveria ver como a luz dança em seu cabelo Um milhão de tons de avelã, dourado e vermelho A manhã de sábado está se esvaindo O Sol está refletido no café em sua mão Meu olhar está preso no seu mais uma vez  Estávamos bêbados de amor esperando por um milagre Tentando nos encontrar na neve do inverno Tão isolados no amor como se o mundo tivesse desaparecido Oh, eu não vou me calar e não vou abrir mão Eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer E nós vamos brilhar intensamente até que a escuridão clareie suavemente  Oh, eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer Oh, eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer  O clima lá fora está mudando As folhas estão enterradas sob quinze centímetros de branco O rádio está tocando Iron & Wine Esta é uma nova dimensão Este é um nível em que estamos perdendo a noção do tempo E eu não tenho nada contra isso, só tenho você e eu  Estávamos bêbados de amor esperando por um milagre Tentando nos encontrar na neve do inverno Tão isolados no amor como se o mundo tivesse desaparecido Oh, eu não vou me calar e não vou abrir mão Eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer E nós vamos brilhar intensamente até que a escuridão clareie suavemente  Oh, eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer Oh, eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer Oh, eu vou aguentar firme até o amanhecer

MISSED YOU🥺
El 2021 definitivamente va ser un buen año!❤
Here he is!! 💙
Me trying to look at every inch of his guitar to find hint of upcoming album logo 👀
OOOOOMMMMGGGGG :)))
You ever wonder why there isn't more of this beautiful kind of acoustic music flowing through the airwaves? The human condition is injured and in pain. This kind of melody strips away the trappings of society and bares the wires of your soul. Just a simple melody can cut very deep, when the wounds are so fresh. Seems much easier to drown ones soul with layers and layers of over produced drivel...to avoid the emotions attached with the music. I, myself, love to wallow in the deepest places these melodies take me. Thanks again, Ed, for taking me to church today. Great stuff.
❤️
falling in love with ed sheeran AGAIN
I love the fact he's so frigging pale.
Wow that sounds amazing Ed sheeran keep up great work you doing amazing. 🤩
in love with this song😍😍

Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden, and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  [Verse 2] The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I   [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Rewind the clock it's amazing: 0:00

Only Ed can cover Ed’s songs. ❤️🥺
Pretty  song
Thanks Ed for being on this earth right now. Your music helped me a lot... ❤️
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates✌️
Happy new year Ed
I'm now certain nothing can go wrong this year when Ed comes with a new song at the very beginning of it...
Who is this guy?
2021 ed sheeran everybody 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 this is a reward for your awesome talent love for you stay safe and keep up the good work
Perfeito ❣️😍👏👏👏🔝
Angel voice ❤️
I love you
Love this man ❤️
This is a perfect way to start this year, with music of the master Ed Sheeran
Dude what about Penguins?!?
🥰 Браво,Эд!!!!
i love you ed....😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Close your eyes and listen to Ed Sheeran. Just heavenly amazing ❤❤❤
Che bravo! Dovresti essere famoso amo gingerino
Anyone else prefer his acoustic covers to the originals? Just me?
Phew!!! The Power of Love that he puts into his music is untouchable..
This reminds me of his first album.
I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU BODY....❤️❤️❤️🇬🇧💯
KING OF KINGS ED👏❤️❤️🇬🇧 I AM IN LOVE WITH THE BODY.....
2021 and ed drops this 😭
This is amazing
💓💓💓
you’re cool ❤️😌❤️
Ed OP
Just release the fking album!
ALO. Dê uma olhada no meu canal, por favor. :)
‘Ed sheeran’ itself should be declared a genre.
Love
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. Galatians 1:3-5
Ed’s back 👏🏾👏🏾
Ed here is gospel of Jesus Christ  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son Jesus that WHO SO EVER belive on him will not PERISH but have everlasting life John 3:16 Without REPENTANCE their is no forgiveness of SINS. Ask God Jesus Christ to revil himself to you. Without  Jesus Christ living in your heart you are poor indeed. Use your talent to glorify God Jesus Christ.
Legends know that this video was already available on YouTube
Awesome song
first taylor, then harry, then ed...kill me now, while I'm happy
Ed is the only artist that literally always sounds better unedited.
Wasn't original already an acoustic Ed, lol but anything from you is welcome❤️
Brilliant musician I started following him when there were only badly recorded videos of his performances in pubs etc before he made it...always thought he was something special!
Can't wait for the pandemic to be over and for Ed to make tens of thousands of people shut up while he makes magic on stage
Te amo Ed. 💫 Salvaste mi 2020. 🍒
I'm kind of getting tired of ed's songs always having the same fucking chords
Вы прекрасны, спасибо за Ваши волшебные песни!Лучший!!!
Last year was so bad because there was no new ed sheeran's songs... Fingers crossed for this year which already has this song!!!!!
Happy New Year for us, ty Ed :')
Voz linda demais ❤️😍
Muito melhor que o clipe
His voice is so amazing and musical 💞
I didn’t think this song could get any better before that riff he did on the final ‘hold on tighter to the afterglow’! 2:26 Love it! Welcome back, Ed.
Ed is a legend, he inspires me to play instruments too, he is so great expressing emotions and life adventure to music he's such a legend
So much better, without that robotic voice from the clip.
He never disappoints!
Hi guys, I come from BALI, Indonesia,,, Ed Sheeran is my Idol,, N this music is suitable for my channel,,,
Perfect
I love it 😭
Feliz año 2021 Ed los mejores deseos para ti y tu familia ♥️
Oficially I prefer acoustic version! ❤️
What so cool about this, is how the chords aren't even hard. Nothing complicated, just a guy online playing a song he wrote, and it's definitely going to hit a million views at least!
1:56 that part. 💯
I'm love you song Ed Sheeran and you 💖💖💖 Ay pero como te amo
This time he didn't left his guitar  😍😋
Happy New Year to an amazing person, an artist who with his lyrics and melodies kept us standing first and foremost, 2020 was quite difficult for everyone, but at no point did Ed stop inspiring me to follow, such is it was not in a direct way, but through his songs he conveyed hope to me Happy 2021 guys
Looks more like him... Good writings and melodic
What a voice and talent
beautiful handwriting happy new year 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣1️⃣ 😊😊From Venezuela🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪
To the haters you just making the man more popular!!! Don’t be silly
Lmao I thought this was about to be a Taylor Swift cover 💀
I’ve started this year off pretty sucky. My grandmother died this morning and we can’t get to her because my whole family has Covid and we can’t travel. But this made me feel a bit better. Thank you!
Easiest guitar progression <3
What a great talent !!!  Never heard a song I don't like !!! 🎶🎶🎶👍
😇😘
My king
This is so soothing❤
I missed this Ed ❤
OMG... As I was watching the original video of this song I thought... "I hope he does an acoustic version!" and then... And then... Its like he heard me
Lovely 🌿
🥰
😍😍😍😍
Me encanto tu musica!!! Besito desde argentina.bs.as.😍❤❤❤❤❤🇦🇷
I love you 😍❤️
I want someone to love me as much as he loves the one about whom he writes his lyrics ...
Te extrañé tanto tiempo! Nunca más nos dejes ❤️
Thank you for the soulful sounds, and the peace that comes with it!
It sounds a lot better with only his voice and his guitar. ✨
This is the way 😪
I love it so much
Whenever you sing, my heart feel warm. Thanks Ed.
Perfeito ❤️
It's the quality of his voice.
te amo eres mi cantante favorito mis papas usan tus canciones cuando travajan
My all time idol, since 7th grade. now im 21 and still my biggest dream is sharing a stage with you. I hope it'll become true
🧡💚💙
so in loveeeee❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are my favorite singer
I couldn't stop staring at the palm tree on his shirt....🌴
completamente apaixonada❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awesome way to try to start 2021❤️❤️✌️🌍🤘🙋🏼‍♀️
thank you Ed for this beautiful song!!!  this acoustic version is just as lovely as the first version that you shared with us!!!  looking forward to more in the future!!!  you've been missed, but so happy for you and your sweet family to have this time together!!!!
Ed, I see you are still using a basic mac keyboard. Let me build you a better mechanical keyboard <3
The start is Great
I love U ❤️
O voce superba! Bravo de așa talente!
This song literally helping me through quarantine
Come on, let's be honest... This is one of Ed's most shallow songs, musically speaking. This song is a song to be in the middle of an album, he can do much better than that.
This person has really the heaven's voice!!
Moldova. Suport!!!
Nicee
❤️
Beautiful (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
😍😍😍😍
It's so beautiful 😍
Glowing voice
Honestly, I can cry hearing Afterglow for the rest of my life and I will be very happy with that.
Been waiting years. sorry but we need more!! amazing.
:3 omg, it sounds so good :D
This is so beautiful
😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Simply amazing Ed!! And such a pretty song!
Love this song Ed! Beautifully written as always.

Thank god for you and guitars <3
How fortunate we are to have him on this earth with us!! So so talented soul with a beautiful heart!
I wish his albums were stripped down like this without all the effects and overproduction with the voice doubles. Just one guy his guitar and something to record on.
Idolo
I love your songs!!!

Wolves
My ears are blessed 😍
Can't wait to see you live again 💛💛💛
Nice song!

What a beautiful song😍😍😍 He writes the best songs for his wife 😊 Get a man that shows love for you the same way Ed does for Cherry 🧡🧡🧡
Ed Sheeran’s fame has surpassed any legend like Michael Jackson etc he’s probably the most viewed artist on YouTube nearly every song he has gets over 100 million views and he deserves it he’s a true legend and we’re so lucky we can witness him in his era He will go down as the best artist in history ✊🏻 🙏

Beautiful version Ed ..man keep singing such soulful and soothing songs <3
We miss you so much
💕Please, chant: "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare" and be happy! The word Hara is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord, and the words Krishna and Rama are forms of addressing the Lord Himself. Both Krishna and Rama mean "the supreme pleasure," and Hara is the supreme pleasure energy of the Lord, changed to Hare in the vocative. The Supreme Pleasure Energy of the Lord helps us to reach the Lord. 💕
iloveyou♥️
definitely, happy new year💛
What’s guitar is it please ?

Nice song and great singer!
Thank you, Ed. I appreciate this so much.
Stop the clocks, it’s REALLY amazing 🥺❤️
I love you ed😌❤️
Happy new year!
I love how he's in his studio but this is not studio recorded. Ed doesn't need any good mic to sound good.
Ed sheeran is back,  well that's a good sign that 2021 will be better
Ed and his guitar that's all  i needed for a good 2021 beginning
Looks like logan paul 🤣

I'm from Bangladesh ❣️❣️..take love brother
*What a good way to start 2021*
Como Amo a este tipo....
Acoustic.. ❤
I really liked this song when it first came but i wasn't the biggest fan of the layered singing so I'm happy to have this acoustic version now ❤
🤗👍😁👋🇳🇱 Thank you!
Love you sheeran! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤
Yeah, I'll hold on to the afterglow
So much better than the original
I made a short cover of this song guys. I hope you can go check it out🙏🏻
Mi día comenzó bien
Acoustic versions always hit different. Love you Ed🤍
i like this one better then the other version very beautiful
Great song ! I Love you Ed Sheeran 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
My fave artist of all time. So talented! 😳💛
Ed, u are perfect tonight
i love this version 💙💙
Anyone know what that guitars model number is?
Ed's voice gives me so much calm n peace n love in my soul 😊 may God always bless u more n more ❤️❤️❤️
Yes!! I was hoping for this!!!!! The album version has that weird echoing stacked vocals thing going on, kinda over produced. This raw sound is what makes Ed Sheeran (In my opinion) one of the greatest musicians of this generation. Beautiful song!
Hi Kuya Ed. I give you a thumbs up, plss give my comment a thumbs up too🤣😁
Simplesmente, Amo tds as musicas deste artista❤
nice video
great ed sheeran 🔥 a great singer and i am very sure he is a great father who will guide his daughter to the same path as her father 💓 I will continue forever ed sheeran let's go for more songs ✨👐🎵

놀랍다.. 그리고 대단하다... 이제 당신에게 입문했다는게 믿겨지지 않아요 정말 천재야
Love you ed❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who's watching in 2021
I didn't like the effect with the doubled vocals (if that's what it's called) in the 'original' version, but this is amazing!
@ed sheeran you simply have a wonder voice! I love this version much more than the studio one. Just your soft and gentle voice and your guitar are totally enough. More isn’t needed! Thank you again for such nice moment of showing, that love still exists even in such hard time. Again a million thanks for giving all of us such nice present and so much honest love. I adore you a lot! I wish you all the best for this year. Stay save and please stay exactly that way like you are. I send you happy regards from Germany.
Always 💖
Back when I was 13 you had just dropped the A Team and I fell in love with your voice and personality immediately❤ So many years later and I'm still a huge fan❤ So proud of everything you have accomplished my dear Ed☺️
I hope someday someone will notice my cover too...
Happy New Year Bro 👍
You is beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful Ok

I like this version better to be honest. I don't hate the original one but the backing vocals that echo are just weird. No hate Ed, I've been a fan of you since 2015 and I love you so much!
He is best at this ...❤️❤️ Love ya ed  Edit: please say hi 😭
Just beautiful.. there is nothing more to say
I love it!
One of the only artists that always have the live versions better than the original :D

It’s amazing :3
Wherever I hear to Eddy's songs, they just make me feel so amazing! Everytime I hear to it, it seems to get evem deeper! Idk how to explain myself, they are just amazing!
One of the best singers are passenger and Ed sheeran, well done both of you
vc é tão incrível acústico ficou melhor ainda!!!
So good song, i love it so❤️❤️
My favourite artist of all time ❤️ Talented/amazing/✨pure✨  This is definitely one of my favourite songs of all time  ✨seee you in the after glow✨
Thank u ❤️
the first song I heard this year and I fell in love
The great thing about this guy, is that he's so down to earth. To not let succes and money go to someone's head is rare these days <3
i love you💛
Tem como não amar esse homem?
Where is ur eye
So amazing teddy ✨
Beautiful song
nice
I really wanted to be a successful singer songwriter , once I thought the xfactor generation was the reason why I was not famous and then Ed came along and like a fighter who just got beat by the better man I found comfort in Ed being the best hands down , its funny his grandmothers family is only up the road from me I cant even hold a local belt lol
I love this version so much compared to the shitty vocoder effects in the studio version. Why producers keep spoiling great voices?
Perfección! ♥️
No joke but you should really consider being a pro singer you know, your voice is truly amazing
iloveyou ed!!♥️😭♥️♥️♥️
Ура!!! Эд с нами))
Happy new year 2021
2021 is already better than the entire of 2020 and its only the second :)
I prefer Acoustic than Performance, thank you to share the both ♥ Well beginning of 2021 ! ☺ (Sorry for my English, I'm French ☻)
2020 : Ed ended our year with an amazing song 2021 : Ed started our year with an amazing acoustic video
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
Calm song for the soul :), the best singer for me is Ed Sheeran🍀🍂
Love this!
My grandma is allmost 72, and she still loves and enjoyes Ed and his music. 💜 She even took me and my mom to his concert in Prague two years ago (in 2019). 🥺🌸🧸
Please do acoustic version of   PHOTOGRAPH  Me and my girl love that song
Eargasm. 💙
Hold on to the Afterglow... welcome 2021 ❤️🙏🙌
Essa música e muito lindaaaaaa 🇧🇷
La tua voce mi emoziona tanto ❤
I did a mashup of Taylor×Ed Afterglow Please check it out here : https://youtu.be/doDOw_pW9TY
Now this is what I wanted. I didn't  like the many voices the original had
OMG, the only one artist who doesn't need any mic , he's just another level. If anyone finds me pleassssse come visit my channel and listen to my voice, I'm waiting just for you!!!

I'm sooo obsessed with this song! Ed's suchh an amazing singer. Each song is filled with emotions, he got inspired from❤️🦋
KING SINGER👑👑
wow
https://youtube.com/channel/UCco00y71ZHt3J7rXWxWhvbw
I'm a Swiftie, i swear i love ed so much, i stan him since long long time ago. But in this moment i just have to say that everglow by Taylor Swift is better than yours hahaha. Don't be mad!!!!!
Quien ya se la sabe de memoria ?😜✌️
I just imagine him singing these songs to Lyra to put her to sleep and sob uncontrollably
This song is on repeat in my playlist
1:10 sounds like James Morrison’s music broken strings oh oh tears me up ....

2021 is already better than 2020
„We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared“ Can totally relate - we‘re still waiting for the birth of our first son while lockdown in Germany 😃 (presumed date was Dec 31st)
Very well done, Happy New Year
Check my covers also 🎃🎃⛄
You are one of the greatest singers of all time!!!!!
It's really amazing! Truth? <3 <3 <3   Come through my channel of relaxing music: D <3
I like Ed Sheeran and you ?
it amazes me how in a world where acoustic guitarists squabble over larger guitar sizes and shapes  (eg dreadnoughts vs grand auditoriums etc ) and tone woods and bracing, Ed just busts out his little mini or parlour guitars and shows everyone that once it plays its good enough
Can you please send me a signed copy of your CD.
Me haces llorar de felicidad cada vez que escucho canciones tuyas, porque me haces recordar que los sueños se cumplen. Pude estar en un concierto tuyo, después de más de seis años desearlo. Y ojalá algún día pueda volver a vivir otra noche tan mágica como aquel concierto tuyo.
WTF I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE AFTERGLOW WAS RELEASED T__T BLESS UR SOUL ED I WILL CRY X__X
One of the best singer ever
Wow! He’s so talented, this is just amazing! Who agrees?
Regardless of different versions, we all know Ed himself is better than his songs ❤️
This is amazing... When i can see more?
*Moral : Acoustic version can be better than the studio version*
Every time he releases a new song feels like listening to him for the first time over and over again and I love it
Everything he does is amazing.
😔❤️👏
👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Stop 60s melody
About time, Ed! 🍂
We love you Ed! This song became my favourite of 2020!
Bravissimo come sempre, preferisco di gran lunga questi pezzi acustici con sola chitarra e voce.
The only surprise that matters.
🥺❤️
I really want the guitars that you've been using. specially that size and that color 💗
This gave me goosebumps
Loved it ❤
The sound of the Lowden complements his voice!
The small puke makes him so much admirable!
Love you dude... Keep it comin
This version is way better cause the other version has that weird echo effect to it and ruined the song for me. But I love this version 10000 more
One of the only artists I can keep coming back to
miss you Ed 😘
Only Ed can maintain this hairstyle and still looks ok.
So warming, his music is there when we need it the most. I sang this on my channel. 🥰
He is one of the real talented people of the time that doesn't need any auto-tune. Love him so much ❤

Love this song
I miss this kind of ed
I was dating with this guy and he changed my sceptic thoughts I had about him quite quickly and we had a lot of fun and it felt really good. He's nice, looks good and is very funny. Oh and he can sing really well. I thought it was becoming something, especially after what we did together and sharing this song with him. He listened to it, he really liked it, shared it in his story and he's going to make a cover of the song... But now.. he told me that he didn't feel it with me and he suddenly fell in love with an other girl.   I still love this song because Ed just sings it so damn well, but it also hurts kind of.. what a way to end the year.   But now this new year I will be focusing on how fun and good I actually am and have my focus on my new job! 🙏🏼🤍
My heart is melted when I'm listening to this song 🥺
Happy New years ❤️
<3
Amazing song❤️
One of the most talented musicians of all time 😭❤️
You my favorite singer
Я тут до 1 млн просмотров)💞 Очень долго этого ждала, Эд - необыкновенный талант💫
As always, the acoustic is better than the original <33333
I can listen to Ed sing all day🤗
Lots of love ed and wish you happy new year ❤️
😍👌❤👏
Ed fans hit a like 👍.
I can’t wait to see how fatherhood and living at home with his family changes his music... I’m thinking a lot more cozy songs like this! Thanks for more music, Ed!!
Perfect❤️ 👇
🔝🔝🔝 a fantastic voice and a guitar... what else do you need to reach the stars ✨
🔥🔥🔥
I love how he keeps his eyes closed through the entire song, really just feeling the music and letting himself go into it, along with us.
Love your music Ed!!
I love you so much 💖💖💖💖💖💖

This song makes me recall my happy memories😀
So glad we got to see you in London and Dublin ❤️❤️❤️ love to you and your family Ed 💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎

His voice his guitar and his lyrics are so amazingly beautiful 🤩
Отличная песня 🔥✌️🔊👍
Hey guys, why did you compete on who writes the most effective comment? Nobel Prize and something like that ... It would be enough to write simply that you love him so much, (me too) and the song is very good, it stays in our head, in our heart.
He uses easy chord progressions but still can create such an amazing song out of it. Pure talent!  THE BEST!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Ed Sheeran never fails to impress his fans by his great talent and music. This is 100% pure talent. ~ Leeron Tai, Pianist of Leeron Tai Music

His voice is so soothing..my god..takes away all stress and tensions..!!! thank you Ed..thank you so much..!!!
Way to start 2021❤️
If your here,it means you have good musical taste.
Beautiful song made my day......
I will never forget my favorite part of the song: "Shape of you" I love the part in which you do twelve: Girl you know i want your love your love was handmade fond somebody like me. In general all the parts of the songs are my favorites.
My idol....
Favourite artist ❤️
In my opinion, this feels like it has a little Neil Young vibe to it and I'm here for it.
So talented 🥰
This song is the healing that my heart and soul needed for a better 2021
I’m not a fan of his but this is one great song .
afterglow 🔥

I can't believe that a human can hate this man

Hi dari INDONESIA
•LYRICS• Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden, and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  [Verse 2] The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I   [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
He’s a good songwriter, I wish he would experiment a bit more on the guitar, he always plays the same chords in all his songs!
One of the most talented singer/songwriter on this generation ❤️ ❤️🙂
Does this man need anyone? Just give him a guitar, a piece of paper and pen and he'll perform one of the best songs you have ever heard! The true rockstar of our generation!
GOD BLESS you and your family brother forever 🎄☕🙏🎧
Lovely Performance 😍😍
Beautiful, he is so good! ❤️

To say I’m in love is an understatement. Ed Sheehan will always have a special play in my heart.
This time the capo is on fourth fret. Standard tuning.

LYRICS: [Intro] (One, two)  [Verse 1] Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden, and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  [Verse 2] The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Lyrics: Stop the clocks it’s amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden and red Saturday morning is fading The sun’s reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  We were love drunk waiting on a miracle Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears  Oh I will hold on to the afterglow Oh I will hold on to the afterglow  The weather outside’s changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing, Iron & Wine This is a new dimension  This is a level where we’re losing track of time I’m holding nothing against it, except you and I   We were love drunk waiting on a miracle Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears  Oh I will hold on to the afterglow Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

Welcome back Ed Sheeran 💟 Hope you had rested well and give us good music again 🥺

🌻🎈
Has Ed Sheeran covered “Here comes the sun.”
💖💖💖
Wow
Questa non e' una canzone e' una poesia! Come in molte delle sue canzoni Ed ci mostra le sue sensazioni, i suoi sentimenti per condividerli con noi. E' un testo intimo, dolce, lontano dallecanzoni che imperversano sul mercato. Forse non incontrera' l'interesse di tutti ma chi segue Ed da anni lo amera' di certo. E' un vero regalo!
you’ve made my 2020
Never been this early! 🤍🤍🤍
I miss your performance
The vibes you're giving are magical ❤️.
2021 and I’m saying up too late again and now I’m listening to Ed Sheeran at 3am to say 2021 looks promising is a understatement
love this 😍
same as the Official Perfomance Video. not different!
justin bieber Lyrics https://youtu.be/bUmPEmE3WVc
The way this song should have been to begin with.
Ed and Emeli Sande, their voices are gifts from angels.

I can’t sleep so here’s a tiny part of the song rewritten into this song lol 😂   Stop the clocks. I should be asleep but here I am and this is amazing   I shouldn’t be awake at 2am on a Saturday  You should see the way the light dances off the moon  A million colors of white and black  Saturday morning, it’s early  The bed’s reflected by the moon in the sky  My eyes are caught In it’s glaze once again  I was sleep deprived waiting for a miracle   Trying to find a way to fall asleep   So alone in the dark then he posted this video  Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t stop dancing  I will sing and dance louder till the sunrise   And I’ll shine so bright in the sunlight   but in all seriousness I’ve been absolutely obsessed by this song since he’s released it. I have had it on repeat for the past few days. I hope anyone reading this has a great day and a fabulous New Years ! ❤️❤️
YOU KILLED IT AS USUAL!! The best musician on the planet right now!!🔥

❤
Christmas treat : Ed sheeran😍 New year treat : Justin beiber😇
This song heals my soul from all that's happening around me right now, regardless of this pandemic. Thanks, Ed.

Love ya ed :)
I have includedthis song  in my playlist ❤️
😭😭❤️❤️
No fancy guitar progressions, just his angelic voice ❤️🔥
Lyrics for you -  Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden, and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  [Verse 2] The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I  [Pre-Chorus] We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  [Chorus] Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
That ginger head boy from a little town of England is doing great!!
I've missed you so much, Ed!

here early!!! lyrics  Stop the clocks, it's amazing You should see the way the light dances off your hair A million colours of hazel, golden and red Saturday morning is fading The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow  The weather outside's changing The leaves are buried under six inches of white The radio is playing, Iron & Wine This is a new dimension This is a level where we're losing track of time I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I  We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow So alone in love like the world had disappeared Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears  Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
