We already wanted to see this but after seeing the end, we HAVE TO SEE IT!!! 🔥🔥
Back to watch again
FNAF 🔥
Their the missing children on fnaf
Cory replaced fgteev
I didn't even know that was cory fucking kenshin when i first watched this!!!
If anybody is so deserving of this it’s  definitely Cory 😭😭😭 I’m so excited yo
I watched the movie today also that's not Cory just a lookalike also Abby is Mike's sister not daughter.
So, there’s beef between another YouTuber and Cory, because Cory paid to be in the movie and replaced the guy who was initially supposed to play the Uber Driver.
Still upset markiplier isnt in the trailer buthopefully he is in the next one cause you know this is gonna be a dope movie
I wish mark could be on it to. But Cory is amazing as well
Five nights at freddy is crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He payed somebody to get into a movie and got out fgteev
I'm going to watch it just for Cory,
Just watch the video
Everything she saying I’m agreeing on I’ll hate to be on the receiving end
A new trailer is out, cna y’all watch it?
I'm so excited to see this movie in theaters.
Bro are ur nail painted🤨??
Nostalgia hitting hard here!!
Cory!!! CONGRATS 👏👏❤❤❤
I got the same shirt Dwayne lol from H&M
as a fnaf fan and a coryxkenshin fan i am really excited for this movie because they were both apart of my childhood
Y'all need to look at the new spider man 2 clip
SO HAPPY FOR CORYYY🥹🥹
1:28
Thr nun 2 reaction??
This video very nice
Congrats to Cory. So glad to see Cory getting his spotlight, there were various other YouTubers as workers on the employee board too. It’s nice to see Scott appreciating his community as a whole.
nice video
Very good job
Hi 👋
The scream at the end! SCREAM KING!
Amazing video
nice video
Huh
Nice video
Nice
HELL YEA IM DRESSING UP I got my Freddy onesie and fnaf blanket with my fnaf plush I’m ready 😜
Hi
Nicely
OMG SPRINGTRAP THAT MEANS WILLIAM AFTON
CORY IS THE LEGENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi
Man it's so good to see y'all still together with no drama and shit ❤️❤️
Nice
Cory's  a mad man😂
Nice video sir 😊
That phone guy in the beginning of the trailer was Matthew Lillard aka shaggy from Scooby Doo, hes playing William Afton the antagonist of the fnaf series, being the one who is responsible for the kids to be "missing", technically they are not missing and that he was the one who killed them and stuff their bodies in the animatronic suits, that's why the missing children haven't been found. The night guard being Mike Schmidt formally being "Michael Afton" aka Williams oldest son.
I have a huge feeling that vanessa is going to becoming vanny in the second one thanks to afton ps I'm talking about the blonde hair girl
Nice 🙂
wow good look
👍👍👍

Amen.   (Matthew 28:18-20) -Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   (Acts 16:31)
nice video
So Cory gets to be in this, BUT NOT MARKIPLIER - THE KING OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S?!?!?!
💖Hey Hey Hey Guys, How are you ✌👍❤💘
The reason golden Freddy is protecting Abby is because he’s technically her dead brother
I remember when Zootopia came out, they had furries as a test audience for animations in the Articles after the movie got released.
Very good
The end of the trailer was awesome
Amazing🎉
I hope mangle is in this movie that would be so cool😊
The little girl that Mike brings with him isn't his kid, she's his younger sister
Saw you guys trending in the movies area. cool.
That was awesome 🤩 😮😎 oh my god have to go see it
It would be cool to see Markiplier in the FNAF movie as well lol
Cory! Now all we need is MatPat and Markiplier
Dios mio que ganas de verla❤ que pena que se retire Scott, alguien sabe como se le puede enviar un mensaje o algo?
CORYKENSHIN ☠️☠️☠️☠️
Ima wear a Cory shirt lol
Good
Great reaction guys. Can't wait to see Cory in his first ever role!❤
Very nice
Not y’all on trending lol
Nice
They should’ve added markiplier
I work at a movie theater and you can wear it, as long as it doesn’t cover ur face.
CORYYYY OMG HE DESERVES THAT ROLE IVE LOVED HIM FOR SO LONG 😭
Nice
Great work. Just keep it up. Lot's of love to you from India.
That girls work in YOU really paid off
Ummm imma ask the bigger question why is bro wearing nail polish
thats not cory its theodus crane
i wouldn’t be surprised if the female officer is vannesa
very nice
I swear if marki is not in this movie.
so im guessing dude dies become golden freddy and saves his lil sis or daughter
Coryyyyyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾
This trailer certified  the movie  ....in Dwayne words....  Fire'er.....  🔥💯🤣💯🤣💯🔥💯🤣💯🔥
Cory is in the Movie, multiple yts were mentioned in the “employee of the month” board, if Mattpatt somehow isn’t referenced, I’ll be surprised
That’s shaggy too
Why does literally no one react to Springtrap??
After learning Scott Cawthon is a Trump Supporter it’s kinda hard for me to entertain anything made by him but I’m glad Cory’s able to be featured in this
Let’s go.
Not sure if y’all know this but Cory is actually good friends with Scott (the creator of fnaf), glad he gets to be in it
Omg their trending
Congratulations to Cory
I just realized that police officer also played in “You” holy shit 😮
LET'S GO, CORY‼️🤘🏽
xiik
Love to see it
I absolutely love that Cawthorn wanted to recognize the let's players that made his game and the franchise become such a success.
Yooo since its coming on halloween its gonna be the BEST halloween movie 🤩 I cant wait to watch it
One of my og favorite animatronics is foxy when I saw foxy I was like "omg they did such a good job with the hook and the model for foxy
Everyday is one day closer to watch children get murdered by live action shaggy.
3:55 if they did it for minions then why not for fnaf
I bet I could make a better movie for Scott. And y'all.
It’s nice to see Cory in the movie even though it’s only for a bit. Also nice to see 8-Bit Ryan, Fusion Z, Dawko, Bazz, Razz and DJ in this even though they also just get a small cameo on the employee of the month board.
1:46, she sounds exactly like the "Hello" voice box in the games. I'm guessing she's the VA?
I can’t wait for that movie I’m so excited
I'm so proud of CoryxKenshin when he actually got a roll in The 5 Nights at Freddy's Movie! 😊
Looks mid
My friend already said he’s dressing up for it
This looks absolutely incredible. I will be there day one.
Completely forgot you guys existed (no offense) been multiple years since I’ve since one of your guys videos
This movie looks kind of interesting.
If springBonnie  is already in this movie. I  expect to eee baby ballora in the next one then at this rate with how fast they’re adding everytbint
Now all I need is for markiplier to be in it.
Man Cory is so scary becauses never do see actor from BlumHouse company XD, And i want see Scott the Phone Guy but is not here movie (⁠っ⁠˘̩⁠╭⁠╮⁠˘̩⁠)⁠っ but FNAF IS THE WORLD HORROR 🏆
Markiplier is definitely going room be in this movie.
What can see from personal view Fnaf movie will alternative story and it comfirned second Movie becouse they are allready started write script.   Arcane is good example alternative to Canon version.  But riot games is now comfirned as Multiverse.   Something a Like Marvel Comics and MCU  If all of you finished these ultimate timeline 4 parts you should watched Game theory Security Breach dlc Afton last stand & I solved ruin.😮😊😅
OUR BOY CORY IS IN THE FUCKING MOVIE!!!!! LETS FUCKING GOOO!!!!
Bro someone was in my house I would've screamed so loudly bruhh
Crazy literally been following cory since 200k on youtube and to see him go from that to being in an actual movie is crazy
I’m gonna keep it 💯 I need a full scene of him breaking ankles in this movie not just a cameo
I wish it was creepier n more scary but I guess it’s kinda child friendly💀
hi josue
Who's Cory?
Spoiler, the girl becomes balloon boy and they gonna make a 2
Congrats to Cory!!!
Were is markiplier?
Do you two have an sudden urge to have some pizza and play Skee-Ball or is it just me?
8f Cory is in it, we already know its gonna be good
Im dressing up since my last year costume was foxy
Who would take this job reading the job description I wouldn't even apply
I was wondering why he didn't upload alot explains it lot 😂 Corry a goat
Shaggy playing a serial killer is perfect casting
Yo
Kinda hoped Markiplier would be the security guard In the movie but I guess Its great that Josh Is filling In the role.
If Markiplier doesn’t have at least a cameo, I’m gonna be disappointed because it was Mark that helped Scott blow up
Bro I got so excited when Cory appeared I was jumping around my room
I just noticed his nails…I LOVE THEMMMM
Also also gamer DAWKO also did a reaction to this,  and showed us where he is on the "employee of the month" poster
How do they make this movie and NOT have the king of FNAF in a role? (Markiplier)😢
in before the animatronics start to dance like Megan in the halls...
I am so happy coryxkenshin is on five nights at freddy's movie and i can’t wait 💚
We just need Markiplier in it and the movie will be a hit for years
Cory gets to be in a movie, when will I get to be in a movie?
Is it just me, or is that Venessa from Security Breach!? @1:15
No cuz it's the fact he exposed YouTube for being shady on the low towards black creators & a year later, he's in a movie 😌
There was some one hating on Cory just because he was famous and popular bro was 1k comments just hating and harassing him
Yall cant watch it u til you review the little mermaid
Dude y’all did this one hour after of when Cory reacted to this
🖤🖤🖤🫰🫰🫰♥︎♥︎♥︎🫶🫶🫶
I once tried to wear my fursuit for Halloween at a theater, and they said you can't wear anything that completely obscures your entire face
Markiplier better be in this movie
so cool to see Cory in it!!!!
Oh is Cory your friend or something?
So happy for Cory. Congrats to him for the role!
Cory came this far,LETS GOOOOO!
As a huge fnaf fan, I’m excited. Coryxkenshin was also a big part of my childhood
Im so hyped Cory is in it but also Razzbowski- 8-Bit Ryan, Fusion and others got to be in the movie I just hope they get Markiplier and MattPatt in the movie for cameos as well
jazz always smilling in the intro   cant stand yo ass
Cory finally gets his shine!!!
I already got a phobia of mascots now i gotta deal with animatronics im be screaming my ass off😂
Samurai slice the like button
They just be shaking their head the whole trailer😂
I’m so excited to watch this movie!!!
Wtf where is mark
1:38 that was literally my reaction when they played the music from the first game
THEY ACTUALLY GOT THE BOY CORY WTF?!?!
We need the samurai shogun himself to be seen through the whole movie😂
🔥🔥
I can't wait to see this movie 😂😂😂😀😀👌🏽💯💯 it's gonna be littt🔥🔥🔥
I’m really surprise Markiplier isn’t in this tbh
When the movie come out in theaters when cory pops up the hole theater is gonna scream p.s who else wants a outlast movie
I'm surprised that mat pat isn't in this
It makes me happy and very grateful because we will have a fnaf movie. After a long wait of 9 years. Scott made it just by being a good producer that he made horror lovers come true with this wish.😭💜💜
They got Kenshin in this peace yeah dis is a day one
There are some more Youtubers in the trailer.
Can everyone stop comparing this to the bananna splits movie just because theyre both animatronic movies doesnt mean thyere the same thing and fnaf would win against banana splits
Did you see spring trap?
So proud of Cory!
I wanna see foxy run
So happy Scott the creator of Five Nights At Freddy's put Cory in the movie.  He was such a big fan of Five Nights at Freddy's game and even got to meet Scott himself and they became close.  I can't wait to see the movie it's gonna be great.

Dwayne why is your nails black please tell me your not turning gay
I’m soo happy for Cory!!! But do y’all think they should of added Markiplier to
So hype. Cory in the movie is so cool. Can’t wait to see more YouTube cameos.
Yo Like 99% Of The World Didn't Expect Cory To Be In The Movie 😂
Imagine Markiplier being the phone guy
I love when the girl said "hello?" It's like how you hear it IN GAME it's SO COOL!
can’t wait to see Cory pull up in a taxi
YESSIR I CANT WAIT TO SEE RYAN AND DAWKO TOO
Corie Kenshi we you ❤❤❤
I can’t wait for this movie! And I can’t wait to see Cory in this movie too!
I can't believe my favourite YouTuber is in a movie about my favourite horror game this is crazy
This is the second trailer technically. It's cool asl
I was soo happy to see Cory I remember watching his Fnaf 4 gameplays
Apparently YouTuber 8BitRyan makes an appearance through an Employee of the Month picture
Corrryyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:36 WHAT!!!!?
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dear god……This security guard can move.
I knew I was not the only one who seen him in the trailer and great video :]
CORYYYYY
the main question is though, where is markiplier?
Still waiting for the reaction vids for other missing DeathBattle episodes here: namely Excalibur Vs Raiden, James Bond Vs John Wick, and Sauron Vs The Lich King. Are they coming? If they not coming for some reason like copyright, then please let people like me who keep asking for them week after week that you can't for that reason.  And, yes, I will keep reposting this until I get an answer or more DB vids come. Now, there are two new episodes of DeathBattle: Dragonborn Vs Chosen Undead and Mikasa Vs Killua.
I’m so happy for Cory but my question is why does Dwayne have his nails painted ?
It's freaking awesome to see Coryxkenshin in this, hopefully Mark makes a cameo also this trailer was pretty great
Never played the games but I’ve watched some playthroughs is the woman Vanessa? If so I hope they get a sequel for the glam rock version
SAMURAI, STAND UP!!!
OMFG IM SO ESCITED!!!!!
can’t wait to see cory in this movie !! 🔥🔥
🔥👌
That’s where Cory’s been
Made me smile so hard immediately when I saw Cory
BEO ITS UP
Are his nails painted. Zesty.
AYEEE The Shogun is in there BABY!
I wondered when you guys would react to this
That’s awesome Cory In this movie trailer let’s gooo I can’t wait for this movie to come out
CoryxKenshin was the first YouTube i ever watch but he got me to watching y'all
All this time cory been asking to voice act in a game and now he’s in a MOVIE???

MY YOUNG NIGHTMARE INTO A MOVIE I CANT WAIT
Bro I cannot wait for Cory
Eight years in the making and it was definitely worth the wait! It looks great and I’m just itching to watch it!
Great we have Cory now we just need markiplier
Now my man Cory is one thing but if we're gonna add a YouTuber on here it would definitely have to be the king of five nights at Freddy himself…. MARKIPLER!!!!
Elizabeth is mike’s sister in the games  Abby is a nickname for Elizabeth   Abby is an anagram for baby
😂 I've never played the games but im looking forward to seeing this in theaters
Cory?
I work at a movie theater and no one can wear any mask but I think they can wear costumes and stuff
Our boy Cory made it. What a time were in
FINALLY CORY GOT A ROLL IN SOMETHING HES ALWAYS WANTED THIS
no way I got a add of the trailer when I just finished watching yall react to it😂
A popular youtuber who made FNAF get some recognition, Shaggy as the head of Freddy's Pizerria, the animatronics and are are spot on. The music and references are great....  I'm in. I'm a hundred percent in!
I absolutely love this
No markiplier? No dawko?
They got my boy in there
3:56 You'd Best Believe I'll Always Have My Suit On And Ready For The Big Show!!  Let The Countdown & Fun Begin 😈
All I got to save people about to lose their minds when they see the trailer cuz when they see coryxkenshin in the trailer they going to be really wanted to go see that movie

This movie is going to be so good
I’m excited I’ll watch it on peacock I hope Cory gets a lot of screen time
I am so happy to see Cory
Amazing!
The official trailer for the Futurama revival dropped today too!
Now that ik Cory in it, I GOTTA SEE IT

I found Cory through five nights it's so heartfelt seeing him in the movie man, it's a unreal feeling.🥲
I genuinly am happy to see that cory gets to be apart of something he's be apart of for a long time the fnaf community Being Involved in the fnaf movie
Helluva boss have a new episode out, you guys will love it. 😊
This movie bout to be a 🔥 and Cory makes this even better so happy for him
That is going to be a good movie
They really got spring trap in the first movie!!! I wish they used the dum dum song for Foxy but I’m so hyped!!
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
First spider man, then smosh, now Cory in the new Fnaf movie? This year is top tier.
YESSSIR CORYYYY!!!!!!!
Not sure if y’all know this but Cory is actually good friends with Scott (the creator of fnaf), glad he gets to be in it
THE LOREEEEE I have so many questions
Also if you look very closely in the trailer so you could see a lot of Easter eggs
CoryxKenshin is in this?!?!
Watching and witnessing Cory being in this movie is going to be so much fun and crazy 😄 I just wonder if they going to have a after credit scene with the “King of FNAF” in the movie for a sequel.
when i seen cory i screamed😭 cory and mark were the only people on youtube i would watch do the fnaf gameplay so i’m happy seeing one of my favourites in this movie 🫶🏾 plus this is one of the big works he mentioned in one video
i hope they put markplier in help to stop them , that would be good !
WOOOOOOOO IM SO HYPED RIGHT NOW!! When I first saw it and saw cory man I screamed!!
This movie going be good
Congratulations to Cory, I don’t usually do horror movies or games but to see him I’ll watch it😂 and it looks interesting as well.
More video games adaptations coming our way!
Jazz u gotta play the rest of the games lol

I almost fell down the stairs when I saw Cory😅
Cory’s in it so it’s already a fantastic movie
Cory let’s GOOO
Hell no, i would quit within the first 5 minutes, hell i don't think that i would even work there in the first place, also cory is here happy for him 😊
CORYYYYY!!!!!
I’m excited about Coryxkenshin 🤩🤩🤩
CORY
So glad to see Cory getting his spotlight, there were various other YouTubers as workers on the employee board too. It’s nice to see Scott appreciating his community as a whole

Do y’all respond 🎉
Wow I’m the first person in the comments well damn let’s goooooo!
I miss yall reacting to cyanide and happiness 😪💯
Cory in a movie
I can't believe it's finally  happening after so long. The animatronics look so good. The Jim Henson Company does amazing work. I just know this is going to be such a great movie.
Hey Dwayne & jazz What doing
If you have seen the live action little mermaid, can you please do a review on it.
Love your guys channel so happy I’m this early thank you for making me laugh all the time
Whats up dwayne and jazz, i know im probably not firsts but i'm here really early. keep up the good work
CORYYYYY!!!
Ayyyyyy ma boi coryyyy
That's his sister
my boy cory rlly made it!!🫡
Best reaction channel on yt for sure
I do love to see they’re adapting the fact that the souls in the animatronics are still kids and that it’s Golden Freddy that will get along with the daughter.  Looks a heck of a lot better than Kraven…or Raven.
If Cory’s in it, then I hope mark is as well
When Cory said he got something in store for us I thought it was the skit with dashie 💀
I wonder how Abby is going to fit into the story as it seems like she’s gonna be taking Elizabeth’s place as Circus Baby
I've been a fan for so long thank you for making me smile every time i watch these videos
❤❤❤
I’m a big fan of y’all.. I love y’all sm and also the fact Cory is in here is crazy and makes it a top tier trailer and hopefully movie
Atleast they fixed the animatronics eyes
I just got finished with this and you already uploaded a reaction. You guys are real ones ❤
I remember this game being the first series Jasmine played on her gaming channel. It’s crazy how this has turned into a movie now. Love it! 💯
