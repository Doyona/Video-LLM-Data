Adding spongebob and squidward to the grass skirt chase was an amazing idea⭐️

2:06 Wow this part is so good!
1:12 who’s this yellow cutie
Wow
Cassandra sounds great in this part! 2:21 I don't understand why nobody talks about it.
Okay You for Taki
(Lyrics to Crucify parts 1-3) 3.. 2.. 1.. GO! (wait) “You demon boy, you will pay for your little sins!’’ (That is the first part)
It’s perfect because spongebob and squidward come out right when they start singing the spongebob reference
I'm so mad my fav mod didn't appear
Sbongebob good and squidward so bad
Bruh ruby sounds like à baby lol
😀😀😀😀😀
At the point where the boyfriend character is SpongeBob it sounds like one of those SpongeBob chase sequence songs

Tbh I imagine bakugou as squidward(aka the one in the cover) and deku as spongebob (aka the in this cover)
Anybody notice the notification at 0:46?
По русски шпарете
1:47. I don't want to be offensive to those who love this character, but it's the most irritating and horrible voice I've ever heard from a character appearing in a FNF mod.
1:18 that is SpongeBob that is SpongeBob SquarePants like the sound game
0:50 / 0:54 that was like the best I think it was the best best best like toward was like the best and time I think it’s his name tell me reply
Crazy Gf is Good:D
Me at start : lets go boisssss Mah sista walksin my room : bruh what is that michelle-_-
omg, they included the Spongebob characters for the actual part associated with him.
HUHAHUHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHUHHUUHHYYY
I’m glad to see more Zardy and Starecrown, their vocals are really nice together !!
One part sounds like spongebob skip to 1:19 on the video listen it sounds like the one video one spongebob it’s called green skirt chase I believe it was called that please believe me look up fnf sounds familiar crucifiy and you’ll find it so look it up right and that’s why they put spongebob and squidward so yeah
tord and tom man very good I loved
I have a challenge to you make fnf defeat
The soul of the mystery
Hi
This is as good as blantdos's!
Ahh, clever. Using the SpongeBob Characters for the part that sounds like Grass Skirt Chase
1:51 someone tell me who are the characters and the mod?
This is dam good
Taki

Tom’s reskin is weird.  His eyes is supposed to be black not pink
Neon night how do you do that
1:19 Spongebob Squarepants

Bomb guy is hurting my ears and ta😩
💕💕💕💕💕 amazing
I just realized.Where's Tea?She's not on the speaker..
Is everyone ignoring the fact that soul bf sounds great here?
Wow
I love to think that we gonna need a Whitty vs Tabi mod called: "Whitty's Revenge" cuz of twitter the Whitty mod has been canceled and i think is like If Tabi killed Whitty then he come back to life somehow to get his Revenge back and show who is the True King Of The Hard Mods.
something I’ve always wondered, why don’t people use the week 5 version of opheebop? it just looks better.
Sarv’s voice is so fluent at 0:30
and please put special characters
Nice of the creator of this video to put the tormentor boyfriend
That episode is flying dutchmen visit spongebob

1:18 Cool that you putted Squidwart and Spongebob cause there is a Spongebob referenfe in this part
Tormentor and Corrupted Boyfriend are my favorite characters
Idk but chara and sans’ part was fire-
I like how right on the spongebob reference it is Trickward vs SpongeBob
0.75*
Yoo this song is lit even you put on slowmotion( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good music
Very good
Idk about y’all but spongebob hits ✨d i f f e r e n t✨
please leave download link
The SpongeBob part was my fav bc of that sound reference and how they made the original sound happen
Fnfirriroe
1:18 fits perfectly for SpongeBob •~•
Now I can seriously only think of two things to change in the original song: changing one note and replacing the singing characters with one who has a high pitched voice and the other with a lower echo-ey voice
So here's a double reference: When you find out you can breed a cat with a whale: "Let's ship a demon and a bunny!"
When sky sang her voice was amazing ngl😉
Crucify Had a spongebob Reference
1:18 the best unexpected part doesn't exist-
Spongebob is like the same of the song he and squidward is a part of the song
1:17 ngl this is cool
I like senpais beat a lot and whittys and tabi and tord bc Im tord

Rip and tear remaster please
1:18 oh lord spongebop in space???

i like how you made spongebob and squidward sing on the grass skirt part
Amazing

Wow i like the monster sky.
I knew it! It was spongebob singing that reference!
Spongbob part is amazing
The best part is they did the Spongebob part where the spongebob reference was in the song!
1:25 spongebob sings that part , *100% makes sense*
Why did the woman who is wearing a bunny costume looks like M.M (Mommy Mearest)
your name is neo night
, and I know your name
I got your videos that boy
1:47 kinda kill me
The spongebob part is the best now its MUCH BETTER

Opheebop and Bob look like in trouble,right?
1:18
SpongeBob part is amazing 1,18
1:19 SpongeBob reference
People saying 0:33 sounds like Norway from the Tord mod
this is super late, but do you think you would ever make a Starecrown and Zardy cover of crucify? their voices here sounded awesome!
"Joder que rico aprietas taki"
My Favorite part gotta be Squidaward and Spongebobs part bc Their at the Spongebob reference part XD
Squidward:GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SpongeBob:please can i use  your clarinet plss🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

0:40 1:18
The best 2 is definetly is sponge bob and squid ward
The coincidenze is when spongebob sing his song(sorry bad grammar😀)
There aren't a lot of covers that use Monster because his songs are, well... Singed, rather than beep booped. Which is a shame because in this case, his voice seems to fit pretty well
Spongebob squarepants moment be like  Omg is Cool XD
It’s funny how in crazy gf turn u can also hear dd

2:38 I don’t know this guy with the red words, so to me he is bootleg Tricky the Clown

lov how sponge bob did his part like the part of the song is from grass skirt chase
1:18 this fits perfect cause this is a reference to the grass skirt chase theme in spongbob
I like this part in 1:47
everyone gangsta until spongebob theme plays
Zardy part his arrows gone?...Then come back...
Am I going crazy or is this not the sounds of a Windows pop-up in the background: 0:45

Starecrown reminds me of Bugfacers  from "the all tomorrows"
Solo grigos van a comentar asi que solo voy a decir:Ñ
1:11 OH IS ZARDY REFRENCE GUY LOL
the fact that they put spongebob and squidward on the spongebob music theme was the best detail on a video i've ever seen
While everyone talks about Squidward and Spongebob singing the GSC part, barely anyone talks about how Opheebop's voice fits every single song
como lo descargo que alguien me lo diga plis ;(
Tea isn't there because she got sick and just spent the whole song sleeping
Lemon demon is mad because sky ate a lemon and sky is like : its to yummy: and lemon demon is like : >:0 don't ate my lemon friends!: me : XD can't stop laughing XD:

I need cover that starecrown and zardy sings crucify
What to song familiar spongebob 1:19
Glad I'm in the BF Side
1:18 :D
Why do "evil & corrupted" characters even exist? That's cringe af cuz that's trying to be edgy, but twice, to make it worse, just make an original character and slap that ugly corrupted skin on it and whatever
Abby and Lucian's part is great! Especially Abby. Awesome job with the cover!
the reference of grass skirt chase be like: 1:18
The fact they actually added spongebob at the grass skirt chase song is just..  Perfect. (1:18)
alternative title: this is a mess
1:19
Love how you used spongebob and squidward for their "Chase Theme" (i think)

Escuchenla en la velocidad más rápida y se escuchará raro  Líke si piensas lo mismo

30/10👏😌👍
I Like it song
🏆🥇🏅🎖
=)
The best part is the Grass Skirt Chase theme, but it is better with SpongeBob and Squidward singing it
Ophobeebo is happy
1:33 They missed out on the opportunity to use the actual Tabi thing. Only people who have listened to Genocide from the Tabi mod understand what I'm talking about.
1:18 They used SpongeBob at the part that sounds like Grass Skirt Chase form SpongeBob. Coincidence? I think not! If it is, then it's a pretty big one!
1:58  IT SOUNDS SOO GOOD
Zardy and Scarecrown. Those two work way too well together
I like ruvs part
1000000000/10😶😁
the fact he actually put spongebob on his part where one of the theme of the show plays is a big brain moment.
The character to the right ↪️ in the second part make me very uncomfortable
Wwwiiiiiiiiii
Perfectly put spongebob when IT was that part!
Only tru fans know that Taki and the second characters (bc he shapeshifts) on the player's side are the same people
I love how the fact they added me 1:29
Is it just me or did y'all hear lemon demon saying ooga booga
1:18 oh i get that reference!
I love the video 0
1:10 Lucian and Abby make the cover better  👏

First time I've seen Sponge and Squid in a cover PD: There are some underrated mod chars who could easily get some covers (like Flaky, Patrick from Bikini Bottom Funkin' and Lord X from VS Sonic.exe), but there are a lot of characters who remained as skins and never got their own voicebank (like ENA, Gumball and Darwin, Shadow, Ronald McDonald and Yoshi)
SpongeBob SquarePants
Even 1:18
Evil Vs Corruption
I love 2:02

For some reason, the part at 1:18 is giving me bad and nostalgic vibes
1:18 it's funny that sponge bob and squidward sing it beccause its in their show
The image of Whitty screaming at Spongebob, as well as Zardy and Starecrown jamming are my favorite parts
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
1:56 name a more iconic duo, ill wait
No one talks about Tom's parts
I like how a few Eddsworld characters are in this :o
i come back here every once in awhile to pretend im fighting someone irl with this
Whitty: starts singing Spongebob: pls dont kill me Tabi: i gotchu homie
What's funnier is that spongebob sings grass skirt chase
Lets take a moment for whoever created this for when spongebob actually sings grass skirt chase  which is in his show. 1:18

0:46 Your computer has a notification :]
1:18 if you listen  to the player you hear SpongeBob music and they have their own voices  i bet the developers  of the mod noticed it, and did that subtle yet beautiful hint
Zardy has a high voice that he almost sounds like a girl

Spongebob:sees taki Spongebob: runs to spuid ward spongebob:help spuid ward theres monster  Spuid ward:sees taki and got bonked
1:19 I see what you did there
The fact he put SpongeBob in the part that sounds like one of the themes is awsome
i love how u put the spongebob cover over the spongebob reference
At squidward and spongebob part it sounded like the grass skrit chase song lol
Zardy and Starecrown make a pretty good duo ngl-
SpongeBob
spongebob put in 1:18 because there is spongebob references(my opinions)
1:18 spongbob sings his own soundtrack
Me gustan mucho tus vídeos 🤗
01:09 👍👍👍😀😀😀 https://youtu.be/AeLtTX13r0g
Okay a Zardy and Starecrown duet isn’t something I knew I needed until I got it!

What makes this funnier is I never noticed the SpongeBob part even when playing myself but when I hear SpongeBobs voice do it I can hear it
1:18 i see what you did there
2:45 love it
1:56 Zardy and Starecrown's melodies in their bit was very well done honestly, I didn't think they could add a more creepy feeling to the song.
Sound Familier Anyone?? 1:19
The part of my brain that doesn’t care whether or not I have functioning eardrums wants to hear a duet between Haachama & Little Man.
That COOL you spent
1:18 pure perfection. Easily the best part.

I like how you put the spongebob characters where the grass skirt chase reference is placed. Great choice, also this is one of my Friday Night Fever favorites, thanks for the bop.  (Btw, the starecrown and zardy duo is my favorite part)
me encanta esta cancion
Me playing fnf crucify  Taki : The first move  done  Me sweating like crazy thought it was impossible
Food+taki=takis

I like that u put SpongeBob and Squidward in the part that sounded like SpongeBob theme song
That sounds normal 0:40
1:18 i love how they put squidward and spongebob in this part of the music-
Spongebob and Squidward became UTAUs

1:49 *panchito* xd
Why am i hearing ooga booga in Lemon demon part? 😁

1:56  is it just me that thinks zardy and scarecrown here voice fits better than the normal song
Idk why but this is my fav song
fun fact: im being taki for Halloween
Why do so much people make tiny girls with knives
Good song
I love how spongebob's turn was the spongebob reference part
It's nice to see Haachama appear in one of these.
Didn't the spongebob and squidward sound like...BEANOS?!?!
Let us be real here:  a cover of Crucify with Trollge, Chara, Sonic.exe (yes, he finally has a mod), Tricky, Taki, and SCP-173 would be spooky.
I love the 2 one because it looks like a omg doll lol
1:20 the fact that their is a spongebob skin and there is a spongebob reference 😳
CJ Invalid?
I wish this was animated
sure this is a remix of spongebob Grass Skirt Chase
SpongeBobs part had the grass skirt chase in it :)
1:11 Seriously, Abby's voice is just too good.

why is the yellow hair before zardy voice looks like a chimunk-
Never realized how much that one bit sounded like that spongebob song until you had him sing it
1:57 Can we talk about how these 2 voices and animations match both the chart and the theme of Taki's week as a whole?
Kdoedpr dorp😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😍😍

Blandantos sprite sheet reminds of stikbot
The fact that you put spongebob at the grass skirt chase part is legendary.
It's clever how you used sponge bob expurgation for the part that sounded like one of spongebobs themes
taki is not happy that there are  unholy creatures rap battling
Who else hears beanos music

Crucify
The one when squidward and spongebob appeared during in the grass skirt chase theme it did made sense.

Opheebop: nah I don’t wanna do a date. Bob: ‘’End of Dialogue’’  Also Bob: *GETS IN ONSLAUGHT FORM AND GETS MAD AT OPHEEBOP* 2nd funny quote ⬇️ Bob: Oooh! Crucify! Even I wanna crucify! Also Bob: *kills OpheeBop by killing them with the spikes from his open wound* Me: AHHHHHH I NEED TO GET OUTTA HERE!
seeing starecrown from the right side is more scary than the left side lmao
"Gaming is intense but.."  *"Takis are seriously intense"*  (comment I found on another video)
Chara sounds like a amanout
It makes sence that sponge Bob was added there becus that part sounded like sponge Bob chase
starving artist fits so well, it’s so nice to listen to. if i weren’t so lazy i would make a taki and starving artist cover lmao
0:48 *health bar magically dissapears*

I think i know this part 1:18

I feel like they purposefully had spongebob for the spongebob-sounding part

Lopl hyrt hola xd mlñpo gctuyw bx Derrrr knioqasG
Am I the only one or is Whitty's part just awsome to me, and it also fits to it so well.... HOW!? And spongebob and squitward are basically my childhood, he is very cultered.... And is sans' voice also calming to someone else? And we need a crucify cover with zardy and starecrown ONLY. XD Idk why but i have fallen (and i cant get up XD) in love with some voices of fnf mods... Hoping im not the only one here😂
Abby: Mad at lucian    Lucian: this is fine
i love how you chose spingbing to do the grass skirt chase part

What neonights
Tbh Haachama singing this song is fitting.  Have you SEEN how creepy that Vtuber is?
Is no one gonna talk about toms part on 0:50 it’s 🔥
My head canon is that CJ is a vampire because like the thumbnails he has and has sharp teeth on this phone now so that makes me think that he’s a vampire
HABLEN ESPAÑOL!
(1:18) Oh you big ear fella.....
*me knowing Neonight will see this*
Like how Whitmore (Whitty) literally blows up health bar to almost zero
i love that u put that girl that replaces lemon demon in there
1:46 WHY IS IT TOO HIGH
I would count 3 things I think are wrong 1 the map should change based on enemy 2 your cachrecter shouldnt change as the enemys dose 3 the score meter needs to be shown at all times
Wow
Pink eyed Tom:50% More angry
noice
I'm still surprised that nobody hasn't notice the Windows sound on 0:46
Click this 1:18
Be…beep bop ?

1:24 SPONGEBOB COVER IS REALLY TIMED
I like Tom's eyes are purple
What mod is this
2:20 Ok but , Cassandra sounds good 😩✨✨
I'm sorry but *WHY IS SQUIDWARD AND SPONGEBOB ABOVE THE WATER*
How do you do that it’s to hard for me how do you do that
Whats funny is that when spongebob and squidward both sing, there singing a song sampled from their show.

I love how you used Squidward and SpongeBob in the grass skirt part
funfact: at this part 1:18 it reminds me of the song from spongebob squrepants this just make it better
#Evil
GOOD HEX 😃
Damn, Whitty and Tabi vocals hit different. Also, nice one with squidward and Spongebob.
Tom sounds like Tricky but he has a voice
It's funny how spongebob was here
1:18 *sponggesjshbib is playing sponangebub music*
1:17 wait-.. that reminds me of a Spongebob song-..
spongbob sound so funni
Only now did I notice that Grass Skirt Chase was in this song
Opheebop just got yeeted by tom
The fact that sky crucifies gf in her mod and now she sings in a song called crucify
0:45 sound windows 10 :D
Similar To Blantados
That Spongebob and Trickward id actaul their voices???
1:18 *spongebob song moment*
0:30 omg pea was simping for ice cream succubus-
Fever: Where’s Tea? Taki: She’s absent and number two idk where she is
Zardy and Starecrown need to duet more
enrico pucci as a mod would really fit to this
We need more Whitty and Tabi duets. I would love to see them sing lo fight.
Lagu referensce
the way CJ has tricky's text so that he is known to be a reskin for expurgaration is kinda cool
1:18 I absolutely love that you put spongebob and squidward during the green skirt chase bit this whole cover is amazing keep up the great work
I think this is the first time someone uses Haachama in something like that
sounds like beanos
🤙🤍🤍🤍❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍😁😁fnf1000
Gtfo / bazinga song next
Tom was Possessed
Pls make video freedom but its opheebop and bob pls
tabi more like taxi
0:01 normal
1:18 Grass skirt chase
Great  you is excelent youtuber
Hachama
Nobody: YouTube: “Yea, this deserves to be on Trending.”
The perfect one 1:19
Me thinking Chara voice look like otamatone
1:18 spongebob song with spongebob and squidward lol
This dude forgot agoti
Game is intense but..    Taki seriously  looks a bite  like sarvente
Tea: Welp, I'm out of there  Edit: Wow, you add Spongebob here
Do stare song
I love it
Seeing Squidward and Spongebob singing the Grass Skirt Chase part in this track was perfect
0:25 this is just what
.....
1:20 beanos?
Do a zardy foolhardy
Evil bf meets corrupted bf 2:12 lol
The Chase spongebob refrence
😳
Is a cool
1:18 B E A N O S
3rd is Tom and tord 2nd sarv and ruv 1 first place is whitty and tabi
Where is Tea?
Whitty, Zardy and Starecrown be singing those high bars. And everyone else sounds so good!
Ok gotta say, Haachama fits WAY too well with this song
I still remember the time my bro hates Spongetale AU. Now he doesn't care about Spongebob being in FnF as well.
1:47 that fit soo well
wait a minute what kind of spongebob episode is this?
1:18 SpongeBob
1:18 Spongebob song
The Sky Mod Sucks The Only Thing I Liked About It Is The thurd Song Not The Assist Or Charater or story
The fact you used Possesed tom is obliviously amazing.
It would be better if you added sketchy but it’s good
2:06 i like this part
THE SPONGEBOB PART THO 💀
good work
guys i found a similar song its sponge bobs grass skirt chase!! https://youtu.be/WLIcD9dhN34?t=39
Tabi said "K-Pop"👎👎👎👎
I asked that to blantados :D
That SpongeBob part was amazing, using actual SpongeBob voices was awesome!
Starecrown!?
Eeeeeeeeeeeeee
BOB OPHEEBOP!!!!!!!?!???
Why what tac Is not here!?... abby, lucian. what happened with tac? ...
LOL  MYS SUNFUNKkK
It is i bob 0:45
Funfact: Taki is both girl and boy.
Taki m ena
Pop🍿🍿🍩🍩 fnf m  ta
i find it so funny that tom’s singing taki’s part considering he’s a jehovah’s witness
The fact that he’s using Blantad is wholesome
The detail how SpongeBob and Squidward have very accurate voices for if that was their voices would be in the Squidward tricky mod
i Love it Nice Job Mewrk
Am I the only one who hears the Windows notification sound at 0:45?
WITTY VS SPONGE
oh hi, i really like your style of video, and i confess i was a little sad that two of my favorite characters didn't show up (Pompom and Hex, but ok, there will always be some characters missing), but anyway, i have some songs from mods you know, I know you know because the characters have already appeared on your channel, and these songs are: stomach ache (mod pompom), careless (mod qt), down bad (mod fever town), acrimony (maginage matching mod), and, your demise (mod monika).
1:18 the best part
The problem is: tabi dont does long note you play EX bf tabi does long note
I can hear candies nuts and see my hair in the instrumental
lol taki ghost
1:18 Spongebob and Squidward were used in this part because it's literally Grass Skirt Chase
yesss we got more boiiiiiiiiiis
Next definitely should do void from week one of fever’s mod
Estercuanr🌏🌏🌏😱😱😱
Katiy😻😻😻
Soul bf sounds even better than last time. How'd you get his vocals?
The beginning is SICKKK
Wow spongebob has cool vocal voice i like it
spignle büp
0:45 did I just hear the window background sound effect? lol
Whos spoingbob
It looks like Sarvente from another universe
0:30 who is the person who is transforming into clown then a mine
😄👍
I just noticed SpongeBob and Squidward's voices actually came from the cartoon
SpongeBob was somehow in...  Edit: A suggestion - Last Chance but every turn another character sings it
The new eddsworld mod is overrated .-.
The fact that spongebob and squidward were there is incredible   Also spongebob’s side sounded like one of the chase musics from some of the spongebob episodes. Now I can’t get that out of my head
You missed the opportunity to put Starehardy instead of starecrown, but it's a good job like always, keep it up
Never thought I'd see whitty yell at SpongeBob
I was not ready for that Zardy and Starecrown combo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUh3ueMP9YQ&t=8s
Good thing u added Sarv, there was an actual mod of a Sarv cover of this
Yes My favorite music mi friend ❤️
The parts I loved: Spongebob & Squidward Zardy & Starecrown Lucian & Abby Whitty & Tabi Monster & Sky Soul BF Chara Sans
HOLY SHOT THE FIRST PERSON WHAS A GACHA HEATER AND A CREPPY YANDERE SHAPESHIFT GIRL
make another expurgation but with this mod: https://gamebanana.com/mods/313045

Mewrk, you are so amazing, you used new covers and they sound really good! I am obsessed with videos that have “Every turn a new character sings”, you do it often, and I love it! I also loved how you add Taki often now, she is like my favorite character. The spongebob and squidward cover was really unique. Keep up the good work!🤩

Haachama joins the battle
I expected more tankman before senpai
Me:when ever Tord is there Tom has to be there       Also me:whenever Tom is there Tord is there
Soul BF and Auditor CJ have amazing covers in my opinion. Great Crucify cover..! 👍
Me encantan estos videos, Tanto en el cambio de animmaciones como en el de voces, gran trabajo Xd
Woah So cool
Me wondering where bf and gf is ._.
Taki looks like sarv but different
1:18 Putting Spongebob and Squidward here was perfect holy shit-
0:46 *_Windows.exe has stopped working_*
1:18  THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT, I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD THE REFERENCE AND IT WAS DRIVING ME INSANE.
Has anyone ever used Opheebop's form in "Freedom!" yet? Because I know I used that form for my Remorse BETADCIU, and I have yet to see anyone else use it.
Okay but can we take a moment to appreciate how amazingly good Zardy and Starecrown sounded together?
bob
1:18 XXD
1:23 *this is oddly fitting*
HE GOT SPONGBOB AND SQUIDWARD VOCALS , AWESOME !!!!
1:18 Perfect
HAACHAMA-CHAMA!!!
かっこいい

Me gustó,  un mega Like 👍😎
So good!
Youve gotten alot better since you started, its to be expected, but you sure were fast.
1:18 LOL
Zardy + Starecrown is a really good combination. This cover is amazing. Good job!!
wuau the one I liked the most was the possessed cj, good job I loved it ^^
Del 1:19 al 1:27 se parece un poco a la canción de bob esponja, creo que la usaban en persecuciones. XD
1:18 why does this sound so familiar
2:08 Evil and Corrupted BF's part sounded pretty good here! Spongebob and Squidward were also oddly perfect for this lmao.
Nice! ^^
ANODAH COVER OF DIS SONG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE IT!!!!!
Some of them says without DTD
Finally, someone else noticed the Grass Skirt Chase motif!
FINALLY someone who isn't lazy and puts new characters on each side

SPOB
I like how you put SpongeBob and Squidward in the Grass Skirt Chase Reference.
0:45 I heard an error sound
Spongebob can sing crucify????
the fact that they added the detail of tom having  pink eyes referencing "You cant posses something twice." from the trick or treath music vid just makes me amazed. great job dude!

I really really REALLY love this video💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞✨ I never thought Monster and Sky would sound so good together

Something that could have fit is that when Hunni replaces Taki, Taki gets back to it's painting  Edit: Also, have you also heard the Windows Notification sound?
Sou cool the Is Ford cool
