Hey Dead by Daylight will you breng back the stranger things back in sohp

Why did you lose your Stranger Things license? Because Demogorgon, Nancy Wheeler and Steve Harrington had to go Is there any way you can recover the license of the characters?
Who else was scrolling through their recommendations and found this and thought “Oh my god Stranger Things is coming back?!”
Please
Please bring them back :(
What are you waiting for, we wants with you come back this amazing DLC.

It's sad to think no one will ever be able to buy the Cummogorgon skin until Netflix gives it back.
Que vuelva está colaboración con stranger things!!!
Cumogorgan
Got this in my recommended and thought it was some weird early announcement lol
Can demo come bakc
Shit gets recommended to me a year later why? Is the chapter teturing in December unlikely but I want to believe
GIVE US BACK!!! NETFLIX BHVR HEAR US
If the dlc does return in Christmas of 2022 I want to purchase the cooomogorgon
I saw this in my recommended today, and I got excited because I thought Stranger Things was coming back.
GUYS OMG THIS IS WHEN THE CUMOGORGON WAS BORN
Seeing this makes me sadder than when my wife left me
this hurts to watch in 2022 :c
Wish the cosmetics were still available or become available again 😭 I only have base and prestige 3 demo
how I would have liked to get it before they removed it on mobile :(
Is there any chance the license will be renewed in the future  Asking for a demogorgon wanter  😭😭😭😭

What i tell you ninja
0:18 It’s like demo is smiling ☺️ aww
sad to see stranger things part away from dbd
rip demo steve nancy but at least hawkins is fucking gone
I’m gonna miss Hawkins man….

Goodbye, Stranger Things DLC!
I personally like how this skin in the lore is a what happened to the Demogorgon as it remains in the entity's realm
Why they got the jizz on demo
I just buyed  the new demogorgon out fit
Give Steve a Hopper skin please
Please, DBD + Puppet Combo
Cumagorgan
All hail cumogorgan he will lead us to salvation!
Okay I’ll be the one to say it, it looks like Demogorgon is covered in semen.
Sneak peak to st season 4?
There faces look smoother
Love the demogorgon 😩 hes my favv since stranger things! & Steve became my favv 2
Looks like someone failed NNN
The Cumgorgon
Netflix: Are you still watching? *Someone’s daughter: **0:11*
The Demogorgon looks really cool with his outfit.
what is the point of making new skins for steve? he already have all we could ask for.
Plot twist- This is a spoiler in season 4 steve, nancy and the demogorgan will be dressed like this
Cummogorgon
*Demosemen*
Steve is fucking packing
Well cum, to dead by daylight
There should be legandary skins for steve and Nancy so you could be like robin and Jonathan and stuff
now introducing the game where you can play as a sweaty teenager who gets chased by the remnants of his sock
You Steve Harrington
honestly, best stranger things cosmetics.
I love dbd
And of course dead by daylight mobile players will have to wait YEARS to get this cosmetics
Cumogorgon
The cumogorgon
You guys literally gave the demogorgon the best scream ever that's what I really love about that killer
Bukake-gorgon
GREAT GAME! WAIT for a F'IN HALF HOUR between EVERY F'IN MATCH just to die in 2-5 minutes with the broke-ass killer hit box, as if the killers weren't already OP enough.
Why is Nancy always getting such ugly skins? D:
More Ash Williams, please
Season four soon.
Cumogorgon
Comegorgon в малафье, и парочка детишек в школьных милых костюмчиках.
Bukkakegorgon
In game the quality is trashy
Rip mobile
Ya'll should make 70s/80s styled outfits for original characters! The aesthetic is everything and the game needs more of it imo.  Not cheesy OTT 80s stuff, but authentic stuff
CUMOGORGON
It's like the Demogorgon, having a, buk...
Жаль что за донат валюту и Ненси опять слишком светлая...
cumogorgon
Fix the hitboxes please
ROOOOOAAAAAAARRRRR- the demogorgon
Cumogorgon
0:35😮
I want the party outfits from season 2 like when Steve is in that suit with the glasses
Cumogorgon
Kum, the kum gorgon us here! That's what we needed! Kum skins not fix the game! Thanks BhvR!
cumogorgan
I thought this was already out
The cumorgorgon
Haha yes we know our game is in a constant state of decline and everyday we have less and less players... Anyway have a new stranger things cosmetic collection :)
I’m just going to say it Nancy look homophobic like those religious people that say they want to help you find god and help your soul but still would call you the f slur, Steven look like he would call you the f slur too but be he would txt you that night saying what you up to ☠️🤣🤣
i feel bad for those who were eating
cumogorgon
Demogorgon cum
Steve > any male character in any netflix's series
Why does demogorgon remind me of a meatball coverd in melted cheese
Mo legal vei
demo looks gross in a good way
Please give me more Steve skinssssss!!pleaseeeeeeee
WTF DEAD BY DAYLIGHT WHY A GAME IS UPDATE "Version 4.5.0" IT'S A NOT DEAD BY DAYLIGHT, A LOOKS LIKE A FAKE GAME DEAD BY DAYLIGHT WTF ;__;! ( bugs new a update :) )
Demo looks so ugly...Good boy
Please redo demos chase music into something a bit more strange
People call Steve a chad but tbh I cannot help but think he looks like Alex from Family Ties. Also Demo looked like he’s been on the NSFW side of the web
Every skin, demodoggy gets more thicc.
*coom* ogorgon
Why does look like demo escaped the jar.
I love how they don’t show how the actual cosmetic looks in game because we all know they look like 🤢. It’s like the trailers are catfishing the actual game.
Steve looks like shit
CUMogorgon
Spermogorgon
the demogorgon cum
Anyone else think it sounds like a 80s horror theme? 😅
Demogorgon Cum
the skin will be called: Demo-cum
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man I can’t get over steves hair
cumogorgon
Now I'm begging for a Legendary Billy skin for Steve and a Legendary Robin skin for Nancy.
I hope In the future Dead By Daylight will have Sebastian Castellanos as a survivor, The Keeper(Boxhead) as a killer and The Beacon Mental Hospital as a map from The Evil Within.
quit changing shit that isnt broke
demogorgon                     cum
I LOVE NATALIA DYER everyone in the comment section tell no one I got crush on her WAIT SHES NIT SEEING THIS OR WATCHING THIS VIDEO IS SHE
Is this a sign of a mother season is coming?
Five nights at Freddys please
The cumogorgon
Tripophobia demogorgon, now that's scary, nice
The new UI is very bad, Clown update is useless, new movement animation looks horrible, hit detection is very bad after the patch, they destroyed hillbilly for no reason. The community is unhappy with all this changes, but they dont care.   Behavior is on the same level as EA in the gaming industy....   Do not invest any money in this game. Just buy things with in game credits, nothing more. Than, maybe they will learn something.  Please dont delete this comment again behavior. You have to deal with the truth.
bhvr pls let us choose our menu music cuz i want this one so bad
wow that demo skin is terrifying it’s cool
Comment 1333
Who came on the demogorgon
Ayo Stranger things is In DBD’s Spotlight Again,This Could Tie to Some Type of News Later? (Or not because idk)
“At last,” said the demogorgon, “I have escaped the bukake room.” He screeched in glee.
The cumgorgon.....
New killer- the semen demon
Cum demogorgon.
Can laury strode get more outfits
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
the new ui sucky plus u cant chill during making gens cause the ecs trick doenst work anymore
Still hoping for Springtrap in this game.
CUM DEMO  CUM DEMO
Love it❤️
Poor Nancy 😖
Cumagorgen
Very Cool
OLD ANIMATION AND HUD!!!!!!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
ok hear me out... i know i might sound crazy but what if... BHVR FIXES THE STUPID ANIMATIONS THAT LITERALLY MKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO E X I S T AS A SURVIVOR, OH U KNOW WHAT ELSE WOULD BE NICE? NOT GETTING HIT FROM 5 EMTERS AWAY instead of making new cosmetics
Demogorgon is so hot
It really feels like the priority for this game is "Buy Rift. Buy cosmetics. Play the same game over and over and over and over we have no ideas for anything new"
So cute
nobody gives a fuck about anything yall gotta drop until yall fix the game. fix hit boxes, rework the mechanics, and actually put in work. yall game isnt even half the quality of this video.
Demogorcum
when do you add any killers? add pennywise or samara from the ring ...
I really wish it was easier to acquire shards rather than give these shitty devs money. I can't bring myself to do it anymore.
Can you do one for ghost face but add a survivor
REVERT THE HUD AND MOVEMENT!
Jesus Christ is coming soon brothers and sisters repent and accept him as your Lord and Savior great tribulation is coming upon the world dont love the world or the things in it  for it will perish away but look unto God for eternal salvation of your soul through Jesus Christ I plead with you with love for time is short!!
4.5.1 worst game update in the last year and a half
Still look better than Cyberpunk 2077 honestly ...
Hes no longer demogorgon hes cumogorgon
the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon the cumogorgon
BRING US SPRINGTRAP AND FNAF!!!!!!!
Skins are the only good thing about the update. If you play survivor have fun, playing survivor is basically impossible now. New animations suck, they make you run slower. Almost every killer was buffed. And hit detection is the work it's ever been. It's sad to say the best thing about this new update was that Harrington got a T-Shirt and the Demogorgon is covered goo
新Ui设计的煞笔一样，任务动作僵硬，刀气一万米，布局看着费劲，赶紧改回来吧，看看steam上的差评，玩了两千多小时这个游戏，说实话很喜欢这个游戏，如果你们不改回来，我相信有更多老玩家退坑，新玩家也不会玩这么蠢的游戏，我也不打算玩了，再见
Pls death by Daylight can u put te other movement, anyone like te new
Winona Ryder AND Dead By Daylight Stranger Things Update on trending
They just sold out the series for a video game...I knew they were going to sellout after the second season lmao hahaha
Fix this buggy garbage game already
This game is almost perfect. If only it weren't for the people who play it. Ends up being a place I love, filled with people I hate. Good times. Anyway, maps are looking great and psyched for next tome.
Spending so much money on this fucking game and keep fucking it up. How difficult is it too stick at the old gameplay. Fucking dumb organisation
Gotta say these are some nice skins I hope we get more for when season 4 comes out
New update is trash
fkin rework that demo instead of wanting an easy cash grab from skins lol
*Zooms in on Nancy's necklace and watch, as if it's some amazing shit*  Bruh who the fuck is gonna notice that shit while chasing or being chased
Once you enable imagination while looking at this Demo skin you won't be able to unsee it
It's stupid what they gonna do to Decisive Strike the 360 didn't need to get fucked up and the HUD is stupid we gonna get tunnel face camp fix the killers the FREDDYS attack The HUNTRESS Hatchet throws you creators lack GAMING CREATION
Cosmetics are cute unless you play the game on low res/graphics like I have to. 😑
Dbd pls bring back the old game the new update it’s not that good in my opinion pls dbd bring the old one back
Why? Is there a new season of the show coming out this month?
The new animations have ruined the game.
Demo looks like one big scab I need to pick.
Steve Harringon played by Charlie Sheen in his new outfit
The cumgorgon
The mall should be added as a map
terrible update. you guys directors show us your chase using survivors. we gonna cut you down in 5 min all of them. even easier than before to use killers. I really don't understand what you guys creativity.
First skin for my Favorite charakter demogorgon

Cumgorgon

This new update f**kn suck Balls...get this crap off my screen 😤..can't see shit lol
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
This is nice and all but are you gonna fix the fucked up hitboxes that came with this horrendous patch?
Updated UI is so bad
Woooow nancy is beutyful
So they can create amazing trailers; but they can’t make amazing animations in the game? You can’t fix the latency issues or the bugs, or heck, even the hit boxes? Tell me why My hit box is 10ft behind me? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm?😳
Cumogorgon lol also am I the only one who doesn't care about any of these cosmetics?
This new update isn’t it😐
Can we get Springtrap for the next killer pwease :(
The demogorgon looks like he got jizzed all ov- I mean IT WAS A GHOST as Randy Marsh would say
The only part of the update I hate is the running and injured animation
Cumagorgan
......
Xenomorph eggs incoming
*"DEMOGORGON FOR SMASH ULTIMATE CONFIRMED!?"*
Hay look its pizza demogorgon
new hud shit
Was anybody scrolling through yt and saw the thumbnail for this vid and thought it was a stranger things season 4 trailer?
I bought the Nancy skin now make the game cross save         Thank you <3
Cum demo cum demo
Zcash (ZEC) > Bitcoin (BTC)
i was hoping that this spoils turn nancy into robin bc id buy that so quick
The new UI is actually really great! Thank you for doing that. Just need to tighten up hit boxes, increase time limit for D-Strike, make Borrowed automatic and indefinite until player is no longer tunneled.
New demo skin looks questionable
Hope they have their halloween party outfits this fall
Imagine Lucas was here
Chucky would be sick in this
Damn I was hoping for Demo with lipstick and a purse.
Cumogorgon be looking thicc af
horrible update put the running animations back please
Hey 👋 just a fellow demo main
The new animations lone dope i mean when u stand it looks not realistic for female characters
Do you think buying all these cosmetics will fix hitboxes? I think so....
Wow
The new demogorgon looks pretty cool, but Steve's dumb.  Why would you ever have Steve wear anything other than the Scoops Ahoy outfit?
ストレンジャーシングスおもろかったなぁ…
with every update from you, they spoil the game more. R.I.P DS HITBOX without hitting the survivor
take the game course again, why are you needing
How does behavior treat demo better than Netflix does
Who else is waiting for the new stranger things season and getting impatient?
wow, trash skins
new killer? I dont watch this
Stupid
Looks like poo
Gj behaviour,  everything on the new update is disaster, this is a new level of trash work from the devs lol
Never clicked on a video this quick!
New Novel: The Script A Mafia Story! Read The Movie...Snitches Get Stitches!
Hey when you guys gonna balance the game ?
This is great and all but where's Springtrap?
how bout we fix the the UI and movement changes and the balance issues before releasing unnecessary cosmetics??
WE NEED AN OFFLINE MODE FOR THIS DAMN GAME!   PLEASE GIVE IT TO US! 🥺🙏
Ah, more overpriced skins. Beautiful
It's about time Dead by Daylight gave the Demogorgon some new skins
I’m hypee ❤️😍
What a shit update pls change everything
That theme music! 😈😈😍😍👌
No Claudette smh......
Oh my
Steve packin
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Does this mean season 4 is coming out Like for the show lol
ah yes, Chad-Steve & rule-34 Demogorgon. Stay classy DBD 👌👌👌
ストレンジャーシングスの新衣装！楽しみにしてたよ！！
I want :'(
Mutated plant animal, crazy
I love that theme
Finally we have something else for the demogorgon!!!😄
more skins same shit servers lmao $$$$$$$ Hungry ?
Hold on we're those eggs on the ground from alien?
Yay more useless things instead of balancing and optimizing Thx devs
A demo skin! I assure you, the 1% of players(myself included) that use demo will cherish this. And that’s not sarcasm.
Jizzagorgon
Please please please change the UI back, this is so bad and distracting, keep it all in one place! I have to look at 4 different parts of the screen to see all the important info as killer - why?! *edit - FIVE different parts!
Cumogorgon
Change the HUD back to how it was!! Keep the portraits and hook count but the health bar is so tiny I can barely see it + the injured portrait is terrible. It makes me so confused. Nobody asked for this so why do you guys change it when it wasn’t needed!?
Yall should add an animation when the survivor is crouching next to a wall but still, the character sits covering there mouth
Cumogorgon
CUMOGORGON  CUMOGORGON
I'm confused, I thought this one of the first killers released in the game
. . . WHY? tired of Stranger Things. EVERY Demogorgon tunnels. i swear to god all of em do.
WOAHH can the Demogorgon actually go in the upside down with his buff like this video :DDD
doesn't even look like steve .. also thought this was going to be an update of some sort to the demo gorgon but nope more skins more money shady devs
0:18 Congratulations! It's a boy!
Democum
Man Netflix should be ashamed that BeHaviour gives more love to the fans than themselves
WHERE IS MY REVEAL TRAILER
If only mobile players had all these updates 😭🙃
but still nothing for bill .. im sad
Could you guys do something like Slender man as a new killer? Since no one really owns the rights to slender man you guys can make your own design, he could distort vision, kinda have a similar thing to Freddy, you can have pages lying around to pick for sanity points or something
Cumagorgon
yay new skins now can you go and fix the damn game?
Ugly Nancy
Cumogorgon...   =/
ugliest UI that they could have made. period pretty good job so far
Bro who came on demo wtf
Unbroken emblem is broken for me. Everyone else's having the same issue?
OMG I love Nancy I am tots getting her outfit she is so cool
Love to see that Quentin has not skins yet. Old traditions must remain the same
Yall didn't have to coom on demo like that
Cumogorgon
I’m just waiting for a Christmas Demo skin with Crimmas tree lights
Thank you dead by daylight
the coomgorgon
Could'nt have done better with the outfits. Mostly because we love the ugly clothes!
The new Hud looks like a from mobile game for my taste
The running animation is really bad in my opinion
MY PATIENCE WAS NOT IN VAIN
Pls behaviour, we need the old movement
I like Demi Gorgon‘s outfit and Nancy’s outfit and I also like Steve’s Outfit
Pretty cool ! But it could be really fun to get Barb as a legendary costume for Nancy ^^
WE WANT 2 KILLERS VS 8 SURVIVORS MOD
nancy ;lookin good about time we get new skins for nancy and steve :D
It's like the entity takes them out of the trials and makes them do a catwalk for a bit
Those outfits are so boring its not worth it
cumogorgon
Cumogorgan
Beauty, this one is.
Ah yes, more skins. Honestly, every time I see a new collection, it just makes me sad. How can the art team do so god damn much and have really good results but the balance and community teams do something good every 9 months.
Shut up and take my money!!
Cumgorgon
If only now they would now fix Nancy where she doesn't look like a crackhead.
The movement sucks
0:41 high school hunk xd
Que buena música.
i love the new animations and aslo btw i was just playing dbd then it said when i wanted to ready up it said i needed to download a patch and yeah when that was done this new stuff was a a thing
Egg the alien
Make a skin Transforming Nancy into Barbara!!!!!!!!
Still waiting for anything for Myers and Freddy.
Guys, whoever working on the updates, there is a lot of bug....one of the annoying ones is when i open the market, the game crashes and log me out...every time...also some ingame bugs...pls fix this
They need to add the pe skin for steve, i would like to see him wearing those short shorts, I wouldn’t wear anything else 🤭
You guys are just gonna outright ignore the community on the hud UI changes?
Cool, but will we ever get an option to gift a skin to friends?
they could’ve went with any other color, but they went with that.. poor demo.
We need more michael myers skins maybe the fire one from Halloween kills
New update and the ranking system is still broken.... good job
Steve looks like a chad now
Dev team I know you don’t care about my opinion I’m just a random nobody who plays your game but why have you made these changes to the UI and movement? It’s so bad I feel like my eyes are being attacked when I play the game now. It looks like some shitty new mobile game not the good gritty dead by daylight I loved and the new movement on survivors is so stupid they stand still like some slenderman dipshit and run like phoebe from friends. This is the worst design choice I have ever seen from a game. Edit: could you at least make shit like this optional I know some people like it but some people don’t like it. I can’t believe this made it out of the ptb without backlash. I can’t believe some people like this on pc. Edit2: just come back from a few twitch streams Otz, Puppers and Farmerjohn. I was wrong seems like most people don’t like the UI change why would you do this to us I really hope you change it back. Please.
ah yes release new cosmetics instead of fixing your game good choice
Steve mains ( like myself ) have been waiting forever! thank you to the Dead by Daylight team!
Please next killer Werewolf please
Psychiatrist: Coomergorgon isn't real, he can't hurt you  Coomergorgon:
I already know how the Toxic steve gonna be. Chad Steve outfit with the "Im too cool to die" shades.
Season 1 Steve coming through
Fix the fucking HUD.
LETS GOOOOOO
Alright, who told Demo to go on r34?
Un huevo sale seguramente
He do be growing doe
Why
The Demo looks gross af, I love it
Cool
I want THE SUFFERING crossover so badly that a underrated horror game on the ps2
I love the new skins and outfits. But I'm not going to lie, I was hoping for alternate characters like how Cheryl Mason has other alternates.
Does this mean my theory that DbD's demogorgon is actually Dart was correct?
I loved these skins
Найс
Cumogorgon
Would lose my mind with a mall map lol
I don’t know if they take suggestions. But can they do a map of the Upside Down?
Give Quentin and Freddy cosmetics plz •_•
The 7 demogorgon mains are happy
Steve lookin a bit like jake
Glad to see you guys are working on the important stuff
yeah cosmetics you guys can make, but fixing bugs in the game no no no
Can i have the game for free now? @DeadByDaylight
I was rewatching s1 of stranger things and thought, "what if they put these outfits of nancy and steve in dbd?" And here we are
So many hackers are in this game please do something
If only the Actual Game looked this Good Visually.. as this is all CGI.
i really like the demogorgon skin so far.
I love demogorgon but this skin makes him looks like a rock that a dog has drooled on
FINALLY NEW COSMETICS FOR MY MAIN NANCY
SCOOPS AHOY ROBIN LEGENDARY SKIN FOR NANCY, PLEASEEEEE
mmmmmmm we do love new stranger things updates 🥵🥵🥵
is it just me or does steve's face look kinda weird
i already knew about this because of r/dbdleaks
Democum🔥😳
Steve is a daddy😍😍
These skins are so boring to me :/
BHVR. I truly, honestly, hate you. I downloaded your way-to-big-as-always-update of 3.6GBs (which mind you for my friends it was only 2.6) and then your anti-cheat system which you pay for tells me I need to verify the integrity of the files. Which I do, as a nice little boy, and then 2 files that have been reacquired are 4.6GBs long? Like WTH, are you guys doing? Honestly, please, for the love of God tell me.
omg delete new updateeee
STEEEEVE
:D
YAAA BABY; Demo love
The Cumgorgon is real
dont lie. we all know anyone playing as Steve or Nancy is a messy chaotic
Money We want money All the money Give us money Money money money
What about my boy bill
make a james sunderland legendary skin for felix richter, thanks
Ah yes, the Demogorgon. The time when I still took Stranger Things seriously.
Horrible HUD, horrible clown chase music, animations of the survivors running HORRIBLE
Ahoy ladies
someone had a good time with the demogorgon..
Wow... Essas novas roupas estão tão fofas
It's a baby demogorgon :D
Why not baseball bat Nancy?
i want to play this game online so bad, but queue for 10 min didnt get a match its sucks,did i couple of time and no result, even queue with 2 of friend abd somehow with 17min and still no match
Steve looks like ash from evil dead 1 now
i want my Alien skin for demo
I'm always disappointed with those Demogorgon skins.  I understand BHVR is probably having to respect lore looking Demogorgon, but I just wish they would give him something a bit more fancy/random, since the biggest meme about Demo is Cute Demo.  My favorite Demo skin is just chain collar and nothing else. Main Demo and stays a Doggo Demo.
Dogshit update as well
Not a fan
cheezegorgon
I love you dbd
Wow that demogorgon skin looks awsome
Everyone: yay new stranger things cosmetics   Me: one day you’ll get cosmetics Quentin
Скины некрасивые , только на демогоргана из 3сезона норм
Steve,are you okay?
Dead by Daylight not even acknowledging the new UI and animations update Hmmm it's almost like they're aware on it's reception and don't care
Still will always rock Steve's scoops ahoy outfit
YES!
OH SHIT AHHHHHH
Bukkake demo😂😂😂
It’s great that my boy demogoron got a model upgrade. Those teeth always bugged me.  I take that bake. Same model, I think.
mobile dont exist :(
No chances for survs anymore.. that game makes no fun anymore... killer speed killer perks and skills are op.. they can easy counter loops and stuff what survs got to survive.. HITBOX bigger then ever i swear.. Feeling like 20 Meter..  tz.. just killerfriendly this game.. they frustated survs.. this Patch fucks all.. they ranked  that killerfriendly game down..    points:   2 / 10
Get my nurse back
I been wait for this one.. turn it up 😩
I love it :D
Yo steve looks real
CUMOGORGON
Badest Patch in history
So sorry, so great the new maps (this time, NOT the junkyard map!) Have become so at the PTB it was already indicated that the new animations are really bad. It just looks ridiculous like the survivors tinker in front of them. Please go back to the old animations!
It would be great if they put alien or predator in the game
DemoPls
The Demogorgon with the G-Virus
Damn, Nancy always looking weird in game
When is the new update coming?
Does anyone else wish the upside down catacombes were a map in dead by daylight? I would love to see a cavern map for this OR each map have their own upside down version
New HUD looks assssssss
Should’ve brought the red/blue vest from s3 in for Steve😩😩
Demo looks like he passed NNN
Ayy these look great
New design is shit
Bring back the old HUD
Is it weird that I thought the outfits are from season 4 but it’s really from the first episode of season 1😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else notice what look like xenomorph eggs around the demo
Drippy 💧❄
I need the Nancy's
Prepare To Battle >:D
Demo looks like pizza the hut.
“high school hunk” me: bish where 👀
Mac Version? Or is there no hope?
Cum Demogorgon
Cumogorgon
Y'all tell me why literally yesterday I was saying the Demogorgan needs more cosmetics!
im definitely glad I don't play the game anymore the game has gone done downhill and it still one sided
Nancy’s new cosmetics kinda reminds me of Laurie’s school outfit, and you know what, idc that they look like granny clothes I LOVE THEM
These skins are amazing. Bought both survivor skins. Thank you for bringing out more Stranger Things skins!!! The whole update is great too. Keep up the great work!!!
I’m gonna say it it looks like the entity cummed on the demogorgon
This will be the only time i will see demogorgon new look since i come across not but DOCTORS
Nancy you have another sweater HOW are you still cold
i need old movement back
Demo: *I got the most beautiful scream in DBD*    Steve : Hold my beer
Pls do a legendary skin of Barbara for Nancy

Steve just got more hot
“STEEEEEEB” ~ Granny ❤️
Still waiting for that Legendary Robin outfit for Nancy
cries in mobile
Demo be covered in nut
Please can you do me a favor update the HUD so the texts are a little bit bigger also can you look into the problem that people are getting guaranteed hit through the window one more thing I know this is asking a lot but you adjust it when you're going around this circle on console it's a lot easier cuz cuz it's really hard for the survivor to juke the killer now
Hell yea
Steve: "Play dead".  Demogorgon: "Hey, that's my line".
4/10
We needs a Krueger skin .
New Stranger Things season?
Shut Up And Take My Money!  Behaviour kkkkkkk
How much money You want if You nerf the killer lunge
Steve is looking a good school boy 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Cool, but can we get the old UI back? New one is worse.
Y'know I would love to have a Hawkins map with the tunnels but like mapped out and dbd'ed
Why does this steve outfit look like jared from subway???    Is that just me or?
5th
Steve’s hair is great
Edited like a mobile ad
Bronx Rn 🥵
The stranger things theme plus dbd theme is the best song in this game change my mind
you destroyed your survivor games with it's new moves that are really bad you are champions for its
Groovy.
cumogorgon
Cumgorgon
I'm gonna need that demogorgon skin
Hmmm mementeable ese Steve haha
Fix your game, not skins forheads
Meu Deus Kakskakksks vai ser choque de monstro
Granny's gonna love Nancy's new cosmetic!! Blesh
Demo covered in cuuum, i mean, maybe
Yeah sure release release skins for characters I can’t use anymore just because I bought a next gen console. Crazy how this still hasn’t been fixed yet. Why is it that I can use all the other dlc I bought except for the stranger things one on series x? I’m not buying them again. They’re the only characters I prestige’d three times and I can’t even play them anymore.
the hud needs to be optional.
Also known as... Ignite all your money and shred your wallet.

Cumagorgon

Put those sunglasses back on Steve
The Demogorgon is an antivac child

It's sad how dead by daylight gives more love to the demogorgon than Netflix does

kinda wish there was legendary skins
Why is the Demogorgon covered in semen?
Everyone's favorite dog is getting a skin.
Demo one is the one that is worth in my opinion.
STEVE PACKING OR WHAT
STEVE' S HAVING A NICE PACKAGE!
The only downfall of that Demodoggo skin is that im gonna have to look at it through that terrible new UI...
demo looks like my nachos that have been in the mircrowave to long.
Cumogorgon
Why is demo so weak? He's arguably the most relevant cross over killer
데모고르곤졸라 정ㅇ 뒤집어 쓴거같네;

Haha nice skins that I'm not gonna buy

STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I figured the Steve from the first episode would come out at one point.
I only play Dead by Daylight, not because I like it, but because Demo is there DemoPls When I sit at the PC I just want to see Demo. I have a sad life, I always think of Demo. DemoPls I look at the sky full of stars and I see Demo, I feel the wind on my skin and I think of Demo. DemoPls I just want to spend as much time as possible with Demo. When I bought this game I thought I would stop playing it immediately, I hated it and still hate it. The only reason I'm still here is Demo DemoPls
COOL!!!
people still say everyone now mains demo
Just finished binging all 3 seasons like last month so this is cool
get those ugly ass holes away from me ;(
Where is the Update DBD?
WHAT ABOUT LAURIE

Beuatiful
Cool Designs i Like demogorgon

they did Nancy so dirty 😭
Steve's voice still sounds awful. Please change it BHVR, get Joe Keery to do a proper voice over
Don't forget guys, there is a lot of different between trailer and in game cosmetic
Dope ass skins but one thing I wish they'd change about these collection trailers is the animations. They look so unnatural and awkward.
Steve remind me of James May for some fucking reason That Demo is sick
ew
Menos skin, mas eventos decentes, buenos y como antes :c
Sick very sick i need the skins i buy me
Yes!!!
