Felicitaciones  La roma de mourinho

Great job Tammy
Tammy Abraham is great, and Mourinho is always awesome to watch.
I am an ultra Roma fan however our second goal was offside
Roma😍💥
https://youtu.be/2gaZaQ9iFaI
Mourinho is a joke.
How is that a red? The keeper wasn't the last man.
Mkhitariyan has found a perfect partner in Tammy. And Tammy is on 🔥
Are my eyes bad or did the var stop the image wrong on the second goal from roma?
Jose has been through though times. Kids watch and learn
The Fiorentina coach name is Italiano. Hehe, he is Italian 😆
Shoma super🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
THE SPECIAL ONE CAN MAKE SERIA A FOOTBALL PLAYING STYLE GREAT AGAIN PLAYING BRAVE ATTACKING QUICK AGGRESSIVE FOOTBALL
I watch roma just because mourinho..
0:28 didn't any body realize that dragowski didnt even touch tammy abraham
Non standard offside line
klo pribadi saya sendiri. grafik masih bagus liga inggris. dari warna, kualitas, detail dan pengambilan sudut.
Mou, 3winner for as roma
*Mikhitarian f off from Roma*
Is the commentator watching from his home? 😂😂
Tammy 💙
Stop putting the score in the title!
Tammy needed this move. I wish us blues would've noticed his talent but hey he needed the playing time and with Roma he will get it perfoming like this!
Come on Rome
Eldor
Let's be honest Dragowski didn't even touch Tammy Abraham.
From VN, from Mou!
I watch as Roma because of Jose 😂
Talk about working from home on the commentary!! Was he on the toilet?!?!?
Шомуродов- хорошо сыграл. Мододец!!!
players of italian origin have jose mentality.i think roma gonna be better with jose.
Wait till Roma lose back to back matches, then Mou true colours will be out again blaming his players, medics, his coaching team, the sky the moon, cat dog except himself...🤣🤣🤣
Forza Grande Roma
Bravissimo Roma !
Войво 1,9млн просмотр!! 1,5млн Шома мухлислари босса керак)))
Shomurodooooov Shomurodov
Mantap..
Disgraceful, delete your referees
Don't they have VAR in Serie A? Why was the Fiorentina keeper still sent off? Were the referees blind? I just saw this video and it already angers me when I'm not even a fan of either clubs. What's the purpose of technology if the referees themselves are incompetent and shameless. I feel sorry for Fiorentina and every club that has to go through things like this. It's unfair and cruel.
Eldor 👍👍
Tammy Abraham on fleek today for all those opportunities
Tammy has been in Italy for 10 mins and has already mastered diving 😂
Villa were never in a position to keep hold of Veretout. As we were utter 🐕💩 when he was here. And when he did play we played him wide left.
the refs ruin this league
Sorry no more serie A . No more Juventus. Cristiano is leaving ….yeah👌✌️👍🏻 Unsubscribed.🤣Following Cristiano.👌👍🏻
the commentary sounds like he's doing it from home
I still don’t understand why chelsea let go of abraham and left werner
Jose such a lovely man donating his weeks wage to the VAR guys ....
*l'arbitrage est amusant Lollll*
Wow his pass is crazy
Is nobody going to mention that the keeper got sent off even though he didn't touch anyone? 🤣 Abraham literally fell over on his own.
Check this one out👉https://youtu.be/B3z2Rh_G6h8
Лучшая лига на данный момент,  атмосфера огонь
tbh serie  a will come down to roma and atalanta
Tammy is proving what Lukaku did in Italy wasn't anything special
thats so disgusting, a red card for acting .... so sad, what happened to Serie A 😐
*Eldor shomurodov*  👏👍
Jose n Tammy both Chelsea and blending well.
Chelsea will miss Tammy Abraham they will regret
Morata needs to learn something from Abraham, 😂😂😂
If Ronaldo goes I see Roma winning Serie A.
Delighted for Tammy
I believe in Jose Mourinho the special one😊
https://youtu.be/st8FLVXB8To
Roma looking dangerous
Refree name is 'ito
That was a GREAT match.
Sounds like the commentator is commentating from his conservatoire
Tammy is on fire
As Chelsea supporter, i really hope Roma win Seria A. Abraham will grow big under mourinho.
that's not a fault after the goal was offside

Congratulations in advance for the trophies JoMo will bring, but my commiserations for the boring football you’ll have to endure along the way.

Is the commentator at the game, or just announcing from the studio? Does anyone else hear the echo?
LIKE ALL OTHER CLUBS MOURINHO ERA WILL END AFTER 10 MATCHES ...... HAHAHA

Tammy going well there, he adapted Serie A quickly as his contribution made AS Roma win...hoping the best for Tammy 👍
ABRAHAM =The New Roman Emperor 👑💪😎
Mourinho always starts better but in midway his teams loses all the hope .
VAR at it's best. I would have literally dragged them out and butchered them right in the middle of the road!
Tammy Abraham 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Sukses di klub barumu Tammy Abraham
Is the commentator talking from his living room?
Does Serie A use VAR better than EPL...asking for a friend.
Offside
so sad pedro couldve been another legend at roma with this team
Roma will win the Serie A and Champions League within 3 seasons.
Was Tottenham the problem?
Эльдор и Генрих красавци будем болеть за них.удачи им
Took no time for Tammy to adjust to Italian football. Not even touched by the GK but DOWN HE GOES like a sack of potatoes!  hahahaha
Mourinho masterclass
Abraham look sharp.in Roma
Can i ask why goalie got a red while he didnt hit Tammy? Was it bcs it was dangerous tackle?
I dont see how the GK got the red card, he didnt even seem to touch Tammy. Also, I dont see how Zaniolo got the second yellow. Lol...
Why does it sound like this was commentated on from a childhood bedroom
RIP Chievo Verona 😔
Only here for tammy
The sound of this commentary comes as if the commentator is in his bathroom.
Mantap
Tammy wouldbe arise
Happy to see Tammy on the pitch. Him sitting on Chelsea's bench is such a waste.
Here cos of tammyyy
missing Jose in PL
I hope Tammy becomes a beast under Mourinho and then returns to Chelsea in 2 years. 💙
Tammy is very hungry he will proved Chelsea wrong.
Tammy looks sharp and up for it
VAR 2x 😂
Roma Jersey looks mint. Love NB wish we still had them

Overproud Shomurodov fans incoming in 3, 2, 1,.....
That red card seemed to be a dive by Abraham I didn't see contact but I won't doubt the refs in this case could've happened
What kind of camera angle is this???
They say mou can't play attacking football what would you called this.....?😂😂😂😁😍😋
Eldor shomurodov super player
Happy for Jose
Abraham😊😊
proud of u tammy! 👍🏻🔥🔥🔥
Dare i say Roma win serie A under Jose.
Chelsea 4 life but for Tammy and The Special I’m gonna follow as Roma  I wish the best for the team
I love Mou

I'm from 🇻🇳. I love Jose
How was Mkhitaryan not offside on that 1st Roma goal? Very strange indeed, seems the refs were on Mourinho's side in his Roma debut. Still, well done and Abraham already proving Tuchel wrong. Nice 3rd for Roma there, great pass/assist.
Seeing Zaniolo play in this match, you would've never guessed he's just come back from back to back acl tears. Unlucky with the second yellow but he will be back even more hungry!
Mourinho will turn Tammy into Harry Kane just watch.
If mourinho want pure drogba physical buy adama tarore just teach him how to score goal
So happy for Tammy
With Juve and Inter declining there could really be a chance for Roma to do something in the league this season.
Everybody wright about Abraham... yes he had perfekt match,  but Mkhitaryan also did very hard job,  he scored first goal , many time taked the ball from apponent and second goal also organized Mkhitaryan
Beautiful English commentary
My favourite coach is Jose mourinho.
Eldor, you are the pride of Uzbek nation. You gotta keep up that hard work. 🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿. Faxirlanamiz!!!

Haha jose still got it
Ronaldo's goal should be allowed if they use the same VAR refree on this match. What a joke
si es ronaldo debe ser un fuera de juego
Элдор Шомуродов красава 👍✊✊
The Special One is back !!!
That's one very dumb goalkeeper .
Never give up! Eldor Shomurodov 14
Suddenly everyone forget Borja Mayoral..😢
italians suit well with jose's mentality. salute.
Abraham with a perfect career transfer. He is kinda slow for a PL striker. A team that plays slow and uses technicality is perfect for him. Also Mourinho is the best possible manager (we've seen this before with Milito, Drogba & Lukaku).
Abraham definitely offside in that second goal, i sense more VAR corruption, it's already bad in England.
If they look every goal in VAR, we can't watch a enjoyable game
Chelsea should have kept Abraham instead of buying Lukaku.
Bravo mourinho..sempre sei prezente..per il secondo posto chi seii..e bello vederti 🥰
Commentary from the guy's bedroom was it?
Jose "The Special 1"..💪💪👍
All Roma´s member is perfect!  Joze is muster of team maker.
🎶Ohh Tammy Tammy, Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Abraham 🎶 Amazing timed run for that 2nd assist, can't wait to see how he develops under mourinho and in Serie A.

Tammy did so well what a game he had
Dragowski to Abraham: Where you going mate? Abraham:I think I'm gonna go past you and score my first ever Italian League goal ⚽ Dragowski:Well let's see then Red Card Given Dragowski:See you later mate Abraham:Yaay in your dreams😂
Well done Tammy
First red card, no touch at all. I watched the game only to see Zaniolo because I heard that he’s special. And he gets sent off. A few very odd VAR decisions. Very odd.
https://youtu.be/9tSInLPybXs
Serie A has suddenly become the most interesting/toughest league in Europe.... (Winners of Europe cup) Tammy doing great in Italy
Mourino vattene

I am here to watch Tammy Abraham. maybe I would follow the whole Roma game this season...
Abraham full of grace
Елдор💪
POV You came here to see Abraham
Tammy Abraham will be a sensation in Serie A - Chelsea missed a trick keeping him.
Was this commentary made in a cupboard?
0:15 this is why everyone makes fun of soccer
Tommy abraham the best striker
And now Mou happy with VAR
Chelsea fan..congrulation for roma n striker
Why the commentary seems off
No red card, first goal offside.......
Forza Roma 💪🔥💛🧡❤️ Daje José Mourinho. Great start.
Respect To Eldor 💪💪💪
I Like Mourinho (SpursFun). I'm now a Roma fan
Jose is promoting Series A, should thank him for coming to Italy
As roma winner 3 point iwan manjah form Malaysia 🇲🇾
I am a Chelsea fan. I am so happy for Abraham.
Just happy to see Zaniolo do his thing after months of injury.
I'm a fan of Chelsea and Roma 😎 So Happy watch Tammy goes to Roma than Arsenal, cause Tammy gonna help Mourinho makes Roma great once again 💪 I really really missed Roma 1999 team spirit 🤗
https://youtu.be/vwVn_MZKOU4
Hope Shomurodov will start play from the beginning of the game
Come here for Mourinho
mourinho be like var is so fair
VAR ruin the game
Abraham was smart enough to not to go to Arsenal. He would've regressed and buried in Arteta's "domination" game
Chelsea fans. You guys have had great italian coaches and players such as zola, di matteo, jorginho, gianluca vialli conte, sarri and ranieri. Now, roma has brought throw some great english players, ashley cole, smalling and now tammy abraham. Roma and Chelsea unite!!
VAR?

Funny how nobody calls them "AS VAROMA". No hate for I Lupi, though, just shows to me that internet trolls know nothing about football match, especially about VAR usage like this.
I like jose

VAR couldn't see the keeper didn't even touch Abraham.
Shomurodov was sent on in the middle of the second half, in a short time he  given a super pass and his teammate scored, imagine a real show if   Shomurodov played more on the field I also respect timmy abraham, it is not surprising that in the future we will see a great show in the pair of shomurodov and abraham
Jose
Man i miss Tam already💙

Tammy Abraham is just playing the role Lukaku played for Inter, holding the ball to facilitate the attack. His height is the advantage
Shomurodov's pass was beautiful)
That uzbek’s wonder kid just wow!
I'm here for Abraham😍
Man of the match....Rui Patricio....
Whoa wat a brilliant debut Tammy👏👏👏  really hope he can make a huge impact at Roma

great start for tammy, but NEVER a red card. ref ruined the game
compare the second goal to the Ronaldo goal and tell me how he was flagged for offside by VAR!!
Glad that tammy picks roma instead of arsenal 😂
Tammy!!!!!! We're always watching!!!!!
I thought that geezer in the thumbnail was Aaron Ramsay. Looks bare like him still.

Great start for Tammy!
Reminds me of when Abramovich said who do you want and Jose said drogba. But this time it was Tammy
Two goals looked offside to me...even on VAR...but by milimetres...
Look at the motivation!!! Tammy is gonna turn to a beast !!!
I am not asking you @CitImmCanada  to resume All PROGRAM DRAWS but at least you can give a tentative schedule for FSW draws or inform us of your future plans, please I request you, @marcomendicino   @CitImmCanFR  @CanadaFP @CBC @GlobalNational. IRCC  SILENCE is killILing us

I speak for everyone when I say Tammy Abraham will be fun to watch along with AS roma in Serie A
We might see quite a lot of red cards from Roma under Mourinho
🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
Can't  wait for Roma to play the top 4(Inter, juve, Milan and Atalanta)
Shomurodov and Mkhitaryan el sharaviy they should play together Shomu played respect well
shoma! shoma! shoma!
Eldor Respekt
Ngakak ya kalo disini VAR itu dilihat pada saat pengumpan mau menendang bola, kalau disebelah pada saat Ronaldo menyundul bola😂😂

I would say, what a sunday afternoon for the italian side, 3 entertaining matches, red card, drama etc etc..
Commentator working from toilet I guess
Forza Eldor Forza Roma
So many personal fans  for Roma- Englishmen for Timmy, Uzbeks/Central Asia for Shomurodov, Caucasus for Mikhitarian etc!

Олга Элдор !!!
Shomurodov ssssssuper asist.⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Chelsea love Abraham
Should Kumbulla start?
If he makes it with Roma and wins seria a and a europa league then he will be the best ever. No one will be next to him. Cause he did it once with Porto if he does it again with Roma then hats off the greatest manager ever
No need such VAR.
Tammy really looks like a top class striker. Contender for capocannoniere. He and Jose will help Roma to be Scudetto.
Great start for roma
https://youtu.be/_NMSmJ6x7lA

Abraham looking like a world beater at Roma! Guess Chelsea will just sign him back for another 100 million in 2-3 years time.
Wherever Jose goes I go
That was offside !
OOOH TAMMY TAMMY TAMMY 💙
Tammy a much better striker than Lukaku already and has so much potential. Chelsea will buy him back for 200MM in 3 years. Great business.
Tammy Abraham about to destroy Serie A
Memang Made in Chelsea luar biasa
This was a great match
The special One !
Romaaaa
no offsides?
Bruh that was no red card but carry on
Best team in Italy
The goal keeper never touched him but he gone fly Stueps 😒😒
Jose he’s magic … I prefer not to speak
bwahhahahhahaha how come romas first 2 goals were accepted and cristianos goal denied
Commentator living in a tin can?
criminally underrated
Two clear offside goals for Roma. I think VAR referees give the images a second early. It doesn't make sense. It's like someone said rome must win.
Jose Mourinho brought me here
Fortnite 3 - Fiorentine 1
Abraham is quality don't know why so many Arsenal fans be criticizing him Roma are lucky to have him
Absolute ballers 💛❤️
Congratulations to the special one
Go go go Shomurodov🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
I still regret Tammy were not given the opportunity to shine at Chelsea...
Bravo Jose Mourinho 🇲🇨❤️
Why does the commentator sound like he was speaking from the rest room?
Shomurodov 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Abraham we know from aston and 2018/2019 Chelsea season
Tammy will contribute to so many Roma goals this season. Wonderful young striker
How many red cards have Roma received since  Mourinho arrived
Followed Roma for years. I can feel the difference mentality under Mourinho. They played like they're so hungry to glory. #ForzaRoma 🇲🇨
Great performance from Tammy Abraham
Top 4 is doable, DAJE ROMA!!!
10 player Roma beat Fiorentine great team by mourinho
TAMMMMMMMMMMMM🔥🔥🔥🔥
Same old Mourinho great at start then fights, differeces start eventually to sacking
Mkhitaryan🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Commentators neighbors won't be happy with all his shouting, jees
Mourinho is a freaking Genius for snatching up Abraham!!....This game woulda literally ended 1-1 if it wasn't for their new tall fast talisman!!
I am so happy for Tammy

Tammy offside..

Let's go Shomurodov He showed a top class. Mourinho should give him more experience
Why is this guy commentating in a portaloo?
Где легенда Фиорентины ???  Где Кокорин???
Ok
Baba Abrahama
Can we get the commentator to not do it from his bathroom again next week.
JM bringing a great spirit for AS Roma team players than make all players are with high confidence to be winning team every matches for sure,congrats for first match
Fiorentina, what are those awful jerseys? Who did this to my Italian team?
100m???
I once saw a game whereby Tammy created three assists in one game. The pundits and commentary ignored his contribution, putting all the focus on Timo Werner. I hope Tammy receives his praise while in Italy. Chelsea are going to buy him back in typical Chelsea fashion and Arsenal are absolutely nobs not bidding for him and the irony is that he wanted to come to Arsenal.
Forza Roma
Dzeko：AS Roma －> Internazionale Lukaku ： Internazionale －> Chelsea Abraham：Chelsea －> AS Roma  Triple win solution.
nice work tammy. let's goooooo
I hope Chelsea no regret leave tammy in future
Roma look great with Tammy
No DZEKO,no ROMA
African born origin players who became the beasts under one of the great managers; Benni Mccarthy, Didier drogba, Samuel Eto'o, Karim Benzema, Romelo Lukaku (Man U), and now Tommy Abraham... We love you Jose...
I actually like Mourinho more than Ronaldo. I will be supporting were ever club Mourinho goes. So let go Roma I'm betting Mourinho will win all 3 cups in his second season with Roma because Mourinho is only efficient for two seasons.
Элдор молодец!!! Так держать..отанга рахмат полвон!!!
look great when epl player play like epl intensity in other league.
Just to say that as a portuguese, the commentator sayd José very well, not common for a foreign 👏
Abraham >>>> Shomurodov
Tammy needs playing time, and Serie A tactical game will be great for his development, just like Lukaku and Salah
Sto godendo veretout titolare al fanta
Forza Romaaaa!
Tammy and Mourinho 💙💙💙👏
Jose.. ❤️🇲🇨❤️
That refereeing was shocking. First goal clearly offside and Zaniolo was not a second yellow
HI JOSE MOURINHO, YOU TAKE ME AROUND THE WORLD :D, I WISH I CAN COME TO AS ROMA ATADIUM TO SEE YOU AND FAS

Now that’s Mourinho magic. You need players with desire to make it happen as well. Look down tools man utd and lazy and timid Spurs
Congrat Tammy 🔥
TAMMMYYYYY!!! So proud man 💙
Sono Milanista ma felice per Mourinho...e per la Roma
Veretout respect as a ex-Fiorentina's player. Didn't celebrate his goals.

Daje Roma Daje 💛❤️

Шома! Что ты делаешь? Не прекращай!
Tammyyyyy
This Roma had the Talents Zaniolo,Abraham and Certainly Eldor Shomurodov,from Uzbekistan!!!
Baraka top Eldor ✊👍
The Special One Jose Mourinhho
Теперь есть ещё одна причина..следить за Ромой...Шомуродов красавчиг... привет с Казахстана 🇰🇿 братьям с Узбекистана 🇺🇿
Эльдор хакида комментария коп ёзиш керак достлар. Дунё танисин бизникиларни . Озбеклар олга
Шома красава!
What a pass by Eldor!)
Shomurodov
I'm so happy for Tammy.
Commentating from his bedroom again.
Roma at least CL places dis season
Henrik is actually dreadful that thru ball pass to Tammy should’ve been played ages ago he could’ve scored
Jose's first win!
Tammy shining under mourinho.
Zaniolo has to be the most overrated player i have seen
Yo commentator use noise cancellation 😑
Yo
Made in Cobham.
oh serie a, how I have missed you! 😍😍😍
roma for scudetto
Here as a Chelsea fan..
Drągowski po co????
Shoma🇺🇿 🔝
As a Chelsea fan gonna be wacthing all of Roma games this year hopefully Mourinho can win them the Scudetto. Man happy for Tammy hope he comes back in 5 years like lukkau
Zaniolo is BACK! This kid is special and will definitely do well under Mou
Jelas var bikin kacau
Браво Рома! Мхитарян красавчик отобрал мяч и создал 2-ой гол для Ромы... и вообще вся Рома молодец
ELDOR SHOMURODOV 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🇺🇿UZBEKISTAN 🇺🇿
Shomurodov💪💪💪💪💪
who else is here just to see how Tammy does
Commentator sounds like he is in the bathroom lol

Eldor fantastic pas!

In my opinion Jose's perfect fit Roma is.

Шома ! Шома ! Шома ! Молодец Элдор !
I’m happy for Tammy Abraham, he’ll be coming back home real soon at this rate
It is normal for Jose Mourinho to start his career with a winning streak, but it will ended with getting sack as always he did in the other clubs, his era is end and his strategy is so dumb, he just the normal one now
Tammy get what he deserves.. He will be a stronger and better striker in Italy..
If British players can do so well at Serie A, then they're a true high quality player
Abraham🔥
Пока кто-то крутит носом "зачем идти в середняки или аутсайдеры топ лиг, ведь лучше бороться в России за 4ку и хорошо зарабатывать", Шомуродов транзитом через Дженоа уже в Роме под руководством Моуриньо.
Forza Roma, Forza Eldorrrr🇮🇹🇮🇹🇺🇿🇺🇿💪💪
The same goal was not given for Ronaldo 2:22
all the best to tammy
Whats with the audio sounding like a zoom call?
That wasnt a red card ...Tammy dived there
Genius Mou
i hate your commentary.. feels like he is in an empty room...
Man seria A is lit
We love Mourinho  💘❣💗💞
🐐
Special one
Олга, Шомуродов. Соглом бул.
Specilaoo
Mouuu
Mıu
Mkhitaryan is the strongest and smartest player in Roma
0:16 That's never a red card. Tammy is going away from goal with also lot of defenders around. Then the referee realized it at half time and give a 2nd soft yellow to Zaniolo as a return. Shocking refereeing.
The commentator sounds like he was watching the match from the toilet
This commentator sounds like he’s working from home.
ok Roma juara tahun ini
Forza roma
miss jose....love from spurs!
Messi era n ronaldo era is end, now we live in zaniolo era
Tammy🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Abraham once a rival in the prem now am just wishing you all the success at Roma you deserve it,, from a Man City fan
go tammy
team Jose
Shomurodov+abraham 👍👍👍 Abraham the next lukaku 🔥🔥🔥
El robo del siglo, ni es roja al portero y por lo menos 1 de los 2 goles de la Roma están en fuera de juego.
Mkhitaryaj and Shomurodov 🇦🇲🤝🇺🇿
Weird sound set up
Great gameplay from Tammy
Milenkovic look like more an attacker than a central defender in this game by his goal.
Tumben #trending
Cháy
i’m happy for tammy
One day chelsea will regret for push away tammy like lukaku
Because of Shomurodaov Roma has 100 mln extra fans
T. Abraham brilliant stat in Roma
Is the commentator in the toilet
Tammy will rule Serie A. My man from Chelsea.
Not a red card for Forentina goalie. No shot at goal attempted. Ball it Roma players knee and he lost control before goalie contact. Goalie was not final man as three Forentina defenders were eventually deeper than the goalie in the center of the field when foul was made. Tackle was not dangerous play either.   It should have been yellow card only.
seria a looks like a premier league last night
Micki and Tammy😍❤✊✊⚽️⚽️
According to you which is the strongest possible lineup for Roma fc l think that rather than playing cristante he can play Gonzalo vilar as he too had a great season so let's make a possible XI (4-2-3-1)               Rui Patricio  Karsdrop ,Mancini,ibanez,Vina/Spin             Veretout, Pellegrini  Zaniolo,. Mikhitaryan, shumurdov         Borja / Abraham/el shara  Any CF as you may like so this is a more attack minded formation defensively if any changes could be done do let me know
Абрахам неплох, Элдор и Мики👍 🇰🇿👋
Shomurodov ❤️
Amazing mou
Shomurodov ole ole oleeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Eldoradooooooo🔥😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱
Mkhitaryan 👍👍👍👍👍
Forza shomurodov 👍👍
è incredibile come un giocatore professionista che guadagna mezzo milione al mese ed indossi questa maglia possa fare certi ORRORI.... Gigi avrà fatto 3 o 4 papere in 20 solo per ricordare a tutti che anche lui è umano
Nice to see Jose Back at what he does best. Win
Honestly hope he does well, Tammy gotta bright future
Well Done Tammy on your debut as a Roma player!!! Keep it up lad!!!
Шомуродов красава!
Mourinho and Team 👍🏻
I'm hoping for mourinho to create another dark horse team. It's been too long since his last triumph.
I came  to see Tammy Abraham I'm a Chelsea fan I miss him
I think Roma still needs a commanding CB. Or the current CBs need to step up their game seriously.
Tammy Abraham 3 assists, 2 for goals, and 1 leading to red card
That red card at the start of the video was a JOKE. I thought that EPL refs are the worst, but Italian ones are right up there.
0:42 miki be like: "am i onside? Would be embarrasing if i celebrate now..."
Abraham, Dzeko, Lukaku 😀👍
what an impact from tammy!
Элдор красавчик⚽🇺🇿
I am happy Abraham is getting the recognition he deserves. Chelsea get ready for a record breaking signing in the future. Go Abraham, go Jose, go Roma.
Well played tammy
10 pemain lawan fiorentina dan berhasil menang 3-1, memang cocok mou diseria A
OH TAMMY TAMMY 💙🧡
Tamy abrahan sumorodov zaniolo pelegrini mikytharian mayoral akan jadi pemain kunci as roma tahun ini
Состав у Ромы хорош,моур тоже
i'm so happy for Shoma! Shomurodov fire

ELDOR SEN SUPERSAN ABRAXAN SENDAN PAS O'YNADI
Shomurodov 🔥🔥🙌🧠
Mou vs Inter
With jose i believe Roma will be a real challenge for Inter
0:28 Nice dive.
Italy may have lost Lukaku but they got the next big thing Tammy
Proud of you Tammy💙. forever blue
This commentator needs to soundproof his room 😂
Ahahahah con mourinho andrete lontano ma molto lontano giu dall burrone
Эльдар красавчик
DAJE ROMAAA
Mikiiiiiiii ✌️🔥
Nice to see Jose still got this "spark". It's gonna be a great season for Serie A.
Shoma krasavchik!
So Jose’s debut kicks off with a win at a fiorentina side that will be looking for europe this season so props to roma, man of the match performance from abraham on his debut aswell great job guys
Mn ni romanisti yg dri thn 90 an
Two goal with VAR succes in roma but VAR in udinese The ronaldo goal not Goal ... WHY ?
Shoma-Forza Roma🔥🔥🔥
ELDOR👍👍👍
So proud of tammy! I hope mourinho allows him to improve and become a much more complete player, looking forward to watching him play this season
Go Tammy and Jose...you both great  #chelsea fan
Tammy deserves all the praise
Roma + Shoma = 🏆
I love mourinho
Mourinho is the best !!
Italian football suits murinho he will do well with Roma
Please take care our Tammy 'Lil Drogba' Abraham and our biggest legend coach Jose 'The Special One' Mourinho, AS Roma!! We're Trust You!! #CFCFans 🐺X🦁
Micki🇦🇲❤
Ill follow Roma to watch Tammy
Roma's 2 goal same thing in ronaldo's 95 min goal and this goal allowed  but cr7's not
Shomurodov 💣⚽
Mf commentating from the toilet?
Jose makes Abraham become useful
Tammy will flourish in serie a  He is quality 👌👏
shomurodov is the best
imagine roma winning the league
Сиделец хоть в заявку попал?? о выходе на поле конечно нет речи
Bos Shomurodov
What's the name of the song at the end of the match?
We also have to give credit to the other Roma lads. They are so humble & work tirelessly for the badge and team, you would mistake their ethics for some new signings.  ⚪🔴
i think serie a var is more relevant than prem var
Imagine in 5-6 years Chelsea re-sign abraham for 120 million😂
Shomuradov klass
Shomurodov fantastic assist😲🔥🔥🟠🔴❤🇺🇿❤🇮🇹
Watching this becose of morinho and Tammy, 👍
How did Man City not go for Tammy Abraham or Shomurodov? They literally look so much better than Grealish 😂
I almost forgot about this channel.. 😅
Grazie mille Roma Armenia
Friends, let's support Shoma (Eldor, like)
Ole ole shomurodov
Roma's summer has been brilliant. To secure Tammy and Shomurudov in the same window was a master stroke. They both fit like a glove and have immediately made a huge impact!
DajeeRoma1927
Pulgar 🔥🔥
Ex premier league players are beasts out of England
This referee gave 2 offside goals for Roma after checking VAR, while that referee ruled out Ronaldo's goal after checking the VAR, which was not offside
Forza Roma!!!
Молодец Эльдар шамуратов
Shoma the best Eldor вапщеее молодец ,↗️↗️↗️↗️💪💪💪💪💪🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
Wasit yh banyak kesalahan
Chelsea are gonna buy him back for 80 mil ...... They don't learn.
No words for seria
Tammy
Tammy The Jammy The Abraham....!!!
Oh Tammy!
The special one ☝️
2 assists on debut for Tammy
VAR in italy is 💩
Шомуродов олга
Ничошный футбол, надеюсь на зону лч
VAR saves the day😎
Dajeeee roma!!!!
1st goal refree show off
Whats wrong with audio??
Mkhitaryan🇦🇲👍💪💪
Шома красавчик
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the great improvement of VAR 👏🏽
Kenapa gabisa diputer anjay
super Jose Super Roma.. Great Tammy and Shomurodov
¡Daje, Roma! 🐺🇮🇹
Great Roma Win 😊
Chelsea are playing 200mil in the d future for Abraham
Zaniolo red card just a little touch.hororo referee
Tammy was a monster 👾
Respect Shomurodov👍👍👍
Mou is a great manager, i hope his return to Italy could prove once again his capability.
Seeing Zaniolo on the pitch makes me so hard.
Uzbeklar ham bormi shomurodov yaxshi o'ynayapti.
Is the commenter recording from bathroom?
Shooooooommmmmuuurrrrooooodddooooooooovvvvvv💪💪💪💪👍👍👍
Can roma with jose mourinho in Inter milano??
first goal is onside, really?!
tbh, IMO that was more or less a bad defence from Fiorentina
Eldorado
Eldor Shomurodov-O'zbek o'g'loni!💪💪
2 assists. Let's go Tammy....!
roma look feisty
Everything same, it's only fisrt game and any 37 another games to be judge Mou. 😂  But, i belive Mou can make Roma finish in P6 or P7. 😂
Highlights are not up to last season's level but still better than many other leagues
wait, that wasnt a dive from Tammy??
Abraham reminds me of Napoli's Osimhen.
Mourino should change the squad of the club .There should be 2 places for attacers. I would love to see Eldor and Abraham to start the next match together from the beginning.
I'm happy for Tammy Abraham, Jose Mourinho and Roma at large
Shomurodov best👍
Aturan baru var di italia sangat menguntungkan tuan rumah
Forza roma
Shomurodov
How on earth is that a red card, didn’t have the minimum touch 🤦🏻‍♂️
Eldooooor you our pride 🇺🇿
MOU🔥
well done Roma
Не пишите Счёт!!!
sho MOURO dov super🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
As Roma can get trophy this year
🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿✊✊
As a Spurs fan I want to see José succeed, even if it didn’t work out for us. He seems to genuinely put every ounce of himself into his job, and gets angry when those around him don’t share that mentality (Dele comes to mind first). I hope it works out for him and he turns Roma back into a member of the big boys.
Mourinho Effect
2 goals were offside, what was VAR doing?
I wonder how they used to play without VAR in the ancient times
Tiktok ads are the worst!!
Cool tammy !
We with you Eldor👍 🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
Mou = "this time, i would like to say thank you VAR"
Шомуродов 👍
Muoriño es grande saludos lo que ven este canal
Tammy looks MASSIVE in serie A Haha
Be strong 💪!!!!Shomurodov 14
Woawww tamy asist 2
Tammy deserved a goal, but so glad he's finally getting the minutes he deserves.
I'm a Chelsea fan, I hope Tammy can be a decent player in this club. Tbh, I love him a lot 🥲
aaaaaaaa mantapppppppppp
Now you cannot just celebrate after scoring a goal. They should check the reff first 😂
🐺🐺🐺🐺
Roma mantull
Why does it feel like the commentary is coming from a toilet
Second goal of Roma was offside, comparing with Ronaldo's goal
Why does the commentator sounds like he is in a room
What's happening with SERIE A Commentary? It's sounding weird  Am I missing something?
Roma to win serie A 2021/22
y'all are forgetting how huge was Rue Patricio. Saved a lot 💯
Shomurodov 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Buona partita per la Roma ma non al meglio per Friotina
Happy for Tammy
as roma helping by referee
Tammy brought me here
Moudinho ♥️♥️♥️
Legend 'Jose Mourinho'
Tammy is criminally underated and unfairly treated in Chelsea. Glad that Mourinho can see what tammy has that other cannot see.
Tammy Abraham was wasted by Tuchel if you look at this performance
Tammy Abraham 🔥🔥
Roma will be a great team under Mourinho..
Shomurordov olg'aaaa
MOU❤
i hope Zaniolo won't be the new balotelli to Mourinho.
The mikhitarian and Abraham chemistry goes nuts 🔥🔥
Var kog gini
mourinho... i alway follow you.
Ншомуродов лчше 👍👍👍👌🇺🇿
Tammy grea8t performance .......
Super zaniolo out and roma won
For the first time i see roma take an advantages from refferee🤣 isit mou & friedkin effect? (Zaniolo reds is clear true)
yesh
No one's gonna say anything about how the Keeper didn't even touch Tammy...
Perhaps the most neutral commentator on earth who cheers for both the teams.
Mourinho will make Zaniolo as great as Sneijder. A classic No.10
🤣🤣The Video Assistant refree meeans Business👌
Epic camera work. Wow.....
Tammy abraham and eldo.... Amazing players
Samadowski debut 2 assist 🔥
This is where Tammy will shine ! From Chelsea fans!
Armada Roma di bawah asuhan Mou ngerih nih.
2 assist from tammy !
What a debut for Abraham
tammy abraham it's a great signing....
no need ref for match because VAR
Really confused with VAR - not a red in the first half and questionable two overturned offsides
Jovane Morgan
why does it sound like my guys shouting from the toilet to the mic at the start
Why is Commentator sitting the Bathroom.
An to think Arsenal fans snubbed their noses at Tammy…morons
🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
As Roma jg franssisco Totti dri tahun 1996 smpai skrg tetep idola sejati blm tergantikan,,,❤️❤️👍👍🙏🙏
Eldor Shomurodov 🇺🇿❤️❤️
I love jose
Timmy is an unselfish player Wonderful young striker 👏👏
Tôi yêu Morinho

Rooting for both Tammy and Jose to win the league as Chelsea fan.

Go Jose Go...
Levramento MOTM Reece James one assist n a goal Tammy double assist   Made in Cobham 🔥 🔥
Shoma in Roma
Can't wait for Chelsea to activate Abraham's release clause for £68m in 2 years! I really rate him highly.
Always Love Team Under Mou...😍
Mantap as roma ...
wowwww, smurdov tammy borja mayoral
José the one speica
Forza Roma love from Portugal♥♥♥🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹👍
Came here bcoz of Tammy
What was that goalie thinking
Mntap As Roma jdi klub terkuat d  seria
Tammyyyyyy
Listen carefully, within the next 4 years or 5, IF Zaniolo becomes the player Roma believe he is, and a bit of luck in the draw, listen well…. Roma will win the Champions League
i think mourinho will fit perfectly with Serie-A like back then with Inter ..
Sempre Forza Roma 💛❤
Eldor Shomuradov красавчик 🔥🔥🔥🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿

JOSE... MEANS DESTROYER
A little shaky at time, but this team looks promising! FORZA ROMA 🔴🟠🐺
Tammy has the potential... I'm just worried he is gonna turn into the next salah or de bruyne and come back to haunt Chelsea...
What up with this season audio
Roma mantap 👍
Shomurodov
sketchy goals
Uzbekistan eldor❤
Tammy did what Lukaku does at Chelsea with better movement. He is back on his best performance again like he did before he got Chelsea contract issue. I hope he doin well with Mourinho.
Whoaaaa 🔥🔥🔥🔥 forza Roma
They got the mentality here , let's see how far Giallorossi run and bite their opponent this season Dajee Roma!!! Forza Roma!!!!!!!
Happy to see zaniolo. Congratz roma for 1st win this year

Tammy & Jose will be big this season
Super assist by Shomurodov
Hope from next matches Shomurodov will join the match from start
Tammy...🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Guenta Roma
Shoma
Spesialis var Tami abraham
Today, after scoring, the players must look at the linesman first and wait for the referee before celebrating
Wow... New face Roma....
Roma Roma Roma ❤️
Forza roma
Элдор прёт 😲😲😲
I am not a Roma fan but I believe Tammy will talk a lot this season.
Matías Viña 🇺🇾🇺🇾🔥🔥🔥
well done jose.
Tammy the chammy
Jose is the best. They were not fair to him. They wanted trophy but did not spend much, as so Tottenham. Jose was fired as they way he talked, not as the way he managed the team. He brought many players to the much higher level like Lampard, Son, Kane and now you can see some new players of Roma this season. Jose is straight speaking that why the people do not like, sometimes I do not like him that way but I must accept that he is the best coach, no doubt.
Mourinho's effect
The audio sounds terrible
Welcome back serigala ibukota roma...
Many Chelsea fans r here for Tammy
commentator forgot his 'pretend I'm in the stadium' mic button.
SHOMURODOV OLG'A 🇺🇿🇺🇿
Forza Roma
Tammy! I Love you From Chelsea fan
Mkhitaryan dipinge serie A 🇦🇲❤🇮🇹
gacorr bgt abraham, lngsng 2 assist. lukaku di chelsea juga lngsng 1goal. josssss
Daje Roma
Sooo happy for Tammy!! Keep going!
Lovely and very stronger tammy Abraham ...gd job
i'm not roma fans but chelsea so idiot throwing tammy abraham he is better than lukaku
Tammy🔥🔥🔥
Go on Tammy 💙💙
Mou biasanya moncer diawal mlempem di akir
Roma 🔥
Love new kit As roma anyone else?🇮🇹🔥❤
Chelsea will regret selling Abraham
Roma are dark horses for the title, I think if they can avoid injuries to their new signings, they may have a chance
Pakai VAR gak seru ah,, selebrasinya kurang natural jadinya,,
This is the rise of serie a , a great manager as Mourinho with a rejuvenated squad as Rome can pose a dangerous threat to the top dogs in italy without mentioning Milan's rise and inter has had some interesting new players but the loss of hakimi and lukaku can cost them dearly
Forza Roma 🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait for us, Chelsea, to buy Tams back for a couple 100 mill after he becomes one of the best players in world football. Or for us to not do that but get mocked for letting him go when he becomes one if the best in world football
2:15 how on earth didn't that last defender clear the ball away for corner? What a childish mistake
As a Fiorentina fan i gotta say we were unfortunate not to get a result today.. Considering the circumstance of our keeper being sent off and playing majority of the game with 10 men we did well though Roma on the other hand look like a great team this year. Zaniolo and Tammy are gonna be the duo to watch out for this year 👀
Roma did nothing yet, we will see when roma meets juventus, milan and inter. Don't exaggerate roma pls. Don't be fools and fanatics.  Mourinho's team tested during hard opponents
abraham has a mad work rate
Roma bought Tammy Abraham or he is on loan?
lol who is that other commentator
Shomurodov is a serious talent
Rarely watch serie a . Came here for Tammy
Tammy Abraham's diving is shameful
Mourinho will bring Roma Silverware in no time
Roma... Winner Serie A🍂🍁🍃
Шома красавчик!!! Пас конфетка)))
The next gabriel omar tammytusta hahahaha KTBFFH

Шомуродов молодец
mourinho/Tammy + ROMA= Scudetto 2022

Linesmen had a stinker
Abraham looking like an £84m Chelsea signing next season!
This is why Shomurodov was signed for!
Lop u pull VAR
This wasnt a red card were is var?
Is the guy doing commentary in his bathroom?
Gg oppa Mourinho  Semoga video short gw menghibur

Great dive from Abraham!
shomurodov 👍
Ooh Tammy Tammy!
tammy ❤️❤️❤️
Debut tammy abraham langsung 2 asist dan main lumayan bagus dulu di chelsea uda cetak 30 gol sama 12 asist kurang sabar nih chelsea
Similar faul made by Musso in game vs Torino yesterday, but he got only yellow card.
Abraham will have a great season
Morinho λένε τον μπαμπά σας
Rimettete la telecronaca italiana brutti down
Tammy underrated
Looks like Aaron Ramsey on the thumbnail
is the commentator in his bathroom?
Yet again the commentary is taken in a bathroom
Shomurodov 💥💥💥💥
gacor new Players 👍
2 striker baru  , bikin 3 assist ... 🔥
Tammy’s hold up play is Kane’esq. He’ll turn into a beast of a striker under Mourinho.
So glad we have a buy back clause for Tammy, always rated him! Shame it didn’t work with tuchel
Was not a red card
Tammy gonna tear it up in Serie A. Will play with a lot more freedom gonna be exciting
wp roma
Shomurodov 🔝. With his skills he shouldn't start the match on the bench.
Mantan club Gabriel Oemar Batistuta my idol
Roma got the best striker in the league with Tammy
Nice debut from Tammy, he'll thrive out there, the league is perfect for him.
One of the rare times Zaniolo is not injured and he gets a red card 👎
Dragowski i Szczęsny top
Here for Tammy Abraham. Chelsea fan in the building.
Tammy 🤩💙
Abraham will become the next drogba/Lukaku under Jose and will return to Chelsea in the next 3-5yrs
Clown A, not serie A
Great assist from Shomurodav
(Dzeko)_ Roma-inter= amazing debut (Lukaku)_inter-chelsea= amazing debut (Tammy)_chelsea-Roma=amazing debut
Awal yang bagus buat Tammy and Roma 🔥🔥
Daje roma daje
Forza Roma😍
Tammy?  What kinda name is that for a male?
Tammmyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
In jose we trust
Mourinho and Tammy at Roma is going to be very exciting this season
I didn't realize Rui Patricio is now playing with Roma now.
what a baller Abraham, great first game with barely any time to train with the squad
Кокорин не играл- расходимся 🪑
Is the commentator sitting in a bathroom ?
great start from roma and jose... imagine if xhaka, matic come to roma... roma will become true candidate for scudetto alongside with juve, inter , milan, napoli...... greeting from milan fans
TAMMY WE LOVE U👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Langsung berguna.. request pembelian di bursa transfer ga sia sia..
Selamat coach Mou 👍
Won my aca
Daje Roma!
Tammy 🔥🔥
Tammy will be back to Chelsea after 4 years. He’ll be 27/28 by then. And he reminds me of Adebayor
Mourinho was right for chosing Tammy
Tammy Abaraham💪💪
who else loves Shomu?
You'll find more and more Blues visiting cause we'll be monitoring our boy Tammy
Lets see murinho with a man down
So happy Tammy's getting game time, and a surprise choice by Mourinho.
DAJEEEEE ROMAAAA
Anyone hear another voice and a burp on 2:20
Шома надеюсь ты читаешь комментарии здесь. Не волнуйся, что Абрахам был в старте. Ты вышел и доказал, что ты не хуже. Зная твои качества, понятно что ты преодолеешь конкуренцию не психуя как некоторые игроки, а используя шансы, которые тебе дадут. Честно, расстроился когда не увидел тебя в старте, но верю в тебя. Оставайся командным игроком и тебе воздастся! Казахстан за тебя!!!
Abraham and shomurodov nice additional to the team
Saya rasa cukup menyakin kn bila melihat cara as roma bermain.. Itu la jose mourinho... Jika anda percaya pada seseorang.. Itu la hasil nya.. Buat tammy ada adalah seorang penyerang yang bagus untuk orang inggeris.... Saya rasa as roma akan berada dalam top 4 untuk liga tahun ini.. Mungkin tahun ini milik serigala roma.... 😀
Mou change Roma mentality...
Tammy seharga 40jt ,tapi pemain yg paling berkontribusi di hampir semua goal Chelsea... 😂 ,Roma dan Jose akan di nanti terus perkembangannya..
Mr Roman , just pay for drogba and dont ask .  Just pay - J.M
Forza Nigeria!!!
Keep it up
Shomirodov olg'a.
SUPER 🔥 SHOMURODOV 👍
Dragowski does not touch at all Abraham. Unbelievable
Shomurodov boshlanishi zo'r. Keyingi oyinlarda chiroyli gollarni kutib qolamiz
Nice commentary bro. You sound like you're inside an abandoned fridge 😄👍
Mou is back..
If the 2nd goals of Roma is not offside, then Rolando's goals is a billion not offside.
Positive vibes, Forza Roma ❤️💛
Mourinho best manager, amazing
Forza ROMA

Did this commentator record this whilst in the toilet?
wow, serie a really is turning into a 2nd tier league...can't even broadcast a game without the commentator sounding like he's in the toilet.
I'm so glad for Tammy.
This video is not available
MIKI + TAMMY🤩🤩🤩

Serie A and Premier League will be f.... crazy this year!!!
The commentator sounds like he is on the toilet. The audio was so bad.
FORZA ROMA
ELDOR SUPER ASSISS GOOOOOOL!

More camera angles on the replays, love it
V A R🤡
The English have arrived
Sakjose 💛❤️
Нахрен им вар, если два гола с офсайда засчитали?!
Is this guy doing the commentary from his empty living room ??
I wanted Roma to win and I’m glad they did , but that was never a red on Drągowski and even said it while watching it live. Definitely a yellow though.
Serie A game were exciting this weekend but refs have clam down with reds thou.
Go on Eldor!
what a game
Cristante and Veretout is the mid duo, one BtoB  MF the other could be playmaker
I always love to see English players doing well in other leagues when it suits their play style more than the prem
Will we get another top club in the football world? Roma looking strong
Is commentator in toilet?
The Best team
why it's say this video is not available??
Veretout 2 goal, mikhi 1 goal, tammy 2 assist , eldor 1 assist. Grazie Roma 🐺
Need a new Defender
Roma victor.!!
It the same as cr7 var will destroy football

What a pass from shomurodov😬
Forza Roma per sempreeee

Tuyệt vời roma
Watch the movement and ball work of Abraham, that boy is world class. Wonder why Tuchel treated him like that.. Really poor man management
Nice work. ROMA
Great mourinho
Awal yang baik...maju terus Roma
Great match for Tammy
Mourinho requests have been bringing instant impact to the team. Forza Roma 💛❤
Шомуродов очень сильно поднялся. Молодцом 👍
Smart of Chelsea to include a buyback option on Abraham when Lukaku winds down..
Well done Tammy, fantastic game, great contribution today. Love and blessings from London. KTBFFH
Fiorentina as always disappointing us
0:48 just look at the excitement of the referee giving that goal 🤣
Was the commenter in his bathroom ? Don't even hear the tifosi ...
La prossima volta usate le riprese del telefonino dei tifosi, forse si vede meglio…
Forza Roma
Mkhitaryan🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Roma got the best coach in the world🙂
I trust mourinho Will bring scudeto to olimpico Forza Roma 🦊
Эльдор красавчик
What a game!🔥🇦🇲🇮🇹
Hello everyone cute cute
whats up with the audio
Mourinho already has influence on this team, low possession, red cards defensive playstyle and certainly more to come...
What a game  Jose mourinho bought Tammy abraham and Shomudorov and they are already carying the team
Tammy Abraham on fire!
