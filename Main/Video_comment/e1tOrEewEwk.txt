no Shadow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the fact sonic got hit with the arrow in his behind just got me going🤣😂🤣
Both of Sonic's and Shadows stands are references  Time After Time is a Cindy Lauper song, while Three Dog Knight could be in reference to Three Dog Night
5:12  you know if he ate shadow from there 1 more bite and he gets to the man hood
never understisimate the chilidog king.
Is shadow dead?
Who Is Here In 2025?
I remember watching this
“My stands name is chemical plant because I’m going to escape the plant of chemical!!!”
Help I Remember 8yo me watching a reaction video of this😂
5:09 there goes a full generation.
Shadow the hotdog
“My power is limited to 5 seconds!” **Also talks for 1 minute**
Di-did bro just eat shadow?!
i just realized when sonic was explaining the rulez of his stand he had his gloves on but then sonic has no gloves 1:04 - 1:18 you can see it your self
Did yall realize this is a Jojo reference?         WAIT I JUST REALIZED SONIC'S ARMS ARE THE WRONG COLOR WTH
Its funny how the inconsistencies are the same. Both Sonic and Jotaro never properly explain why they are able to move in stopped time.
I really like how Sonic's Stand looks like a Spikey Mario
Very Nice Sonic X Jojo Bizarre Adventure Sonic Vs Shadow Eating Chilli Dog That's Sonic Speed Gotta Go Fast Sonic Winner Shadow Lose
I heard 'Chili dog', and looked at sonic at the same time, I knew this duel was over the moment I heard it.
Is anyone in 2025?
Why can’t he just take a risk and take off his Hebron? Rings just to go faster
everyone always does part 3...
Dang... Anyone in 2025 and almost in 2026?  👇
Omnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom  OMNOM!

Cream: Sonic did You see where Shadow Sonic: uhhh idk Shadow in mode Chilidog: HEEEEEELP Cream:	 DID YOU JUST ATE SHADOW Sonic: oh shi- Cream: YOU FOOL YOU WILL PAY GETTING A JOB APLICATION

Bro why did he eat the bottom of the chili dog first
Bro… Rouge..☠️
HOT NIGHTS! HOT DOGS! GEEET YOUR HOT DOGS! 0:50
TIME AFTER TIME IS COOL
WHAT IF SHADOW WAS SUPER? THEN WHO WINS?
"I don't wanna become a chili dog, i don't wanna! 😢"
He ate shadow!!!!!!
Tell that to dio 0:30
Blue-Blur would be an awesome stand name
This feels like yugioh season 0 where sonic is yami yugi and this is a shadow game 1:06 1:15
I did the reason why shadow lose because he was talking when sonic is kick eating
Wow
Listen. If i know people, ts is a fetish.
Anyone here August 2025
Good animations but I'll dislike it
i time travel
Sonic's bazzre adventure
SoSo

Oh my gosh sonic your so handsome with your six pack!?😘😻😍😚😉😉 p.s sonic, you are so hot!?😻💝💕😘😚😍 -from your girlfriend Ruby ❤😊
That isn’t real sonic
If Shadow shut up he'll have won
2:31 nah your not eqal in sonic speed
Anime Be like:
Boom sonic would do this.
Sonic is unbeatable.
Sonic and vore.  Don't look it up.
Arrivederci Shadio Brando
Me when saw one of this short titled “shadow eats sonics chili dog”: I never saw fully watched the video anyways, I wonder what happened.  My cringeside: ThEy GOnnA MAke OuT.  Me: No, shadow is gonna turn into a chili dog and get eaten by sonic!  My cringe side when 1:13 happened: sonic is gonna blow shadow~  Me: NO, their just gonna have a chili dog eating contest, no susy thing gonna happen.  My cringe side: sonics gonna eat shadows heart out~  Me: he’s going to eat him!!!!  Me when I reach 4:50: I KNEW IT, I KNEW SONIC WAS LITERALLY GOING TO EAT SHADOW, TAKE THAT CRINGE SIDE ME!!!  Warning: this did not actually happen, it’s just a joke post.
How did they eat that many choli dogs and remain their perfect abs?
4:29 Vegeta level desperate
za waurdo what has happened to you! 0:27
Finally!a video that doesn’t have cussing 😌
Moral of this video is dont cheat
Time after time is [title card] 1:57
Shadow are dumb sonic can do that to you sonic cannot do make infinite chili dogs
Try hard be like: soinc
4:06 sounds like balloony
Sonic started at the bottom when shadow became chili dog so that would mean.........
Sonic’s stand should be called Crash 40 and have a power called “live and learn”. Idk what Live and learn would do though
As they say  Time can never be your trusted friend. Or your sworn ally
Diavolo possibly died in this. It's canon.
your basically eating shadow's "hot dog" though
Whitekid:sons of eggman 🤍🥚🥚🖤
Superbossmode WK vs blackwolf bk 🤍🖤
I think that Sonic’s stand also gives whoever he chooses a ginormous ego boost
Who's watching in 2025?👇
shadio vs jonic
😂😂😂
5:07 AYO why did he bite that part
He ate his middle part 💀
Shadow: MY STAND CAN STOP TIME! Sonic: so it's the same type of stand as Three Dog Night
I like how he still says "im the ultimate lifeform"
Sonic canonically runs while time is basically stopped-
Sonic: i gainrd a stand of my own...... PLOT ARMO-
If there this buff imagine if he used wario.....
I love how he kept the troupe of him monologuing and not actually doing anything in stopped time.
If Shadow wasnt narrating he would win
Sonic fr said “do it, no balls”
I miss this now Is 2025 I use to watch this when I was 9 now I'm 13 😢
The Power of the MC
MAKE MORE OF THESE
Can we get a part two of JoJo sonic
4:35
Is it just me or does Sonic sound like the guy from Sub's youtube channel
He so fast he can move even when time has stopped literally
this is better then the sonic 3 movie
Mèeee 😂❤
TBH I thought he was gonna say "oh shadow, I just love chilli dogs"
I mean Sonic was so fast in the first movie stopped time how fast he was
This Is so stupid. And I love it. 🤣
Nice sonic
Why does sonic always sound so epic?😂
This is hilarious, because i love both Jojo and Sonic, but this is killing me inside for some reason
JoJo Sonic Vs Shadow JoJo
Perfect animation to watch while eating hot dogs 😋😋
Subbed thanks for making this
4:57 Shadow Turned Into Chill Dog!
The Bizarre Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog
Lord X: can i have some chilli dogs?
stands are named after songs/song writers, therefore accurate
“I can stop time” “so what?”
These sonadow fics are getting pretty weird
i wish that sonic won but my wish came true,thanks mashed for everything ❤
sonic just eaten shadow sonic chill
My childhood I rem amber this😢
🙄🙄 0:25 ok that looks pretty cool
Yay Sonic!!!
5 minute monologue in 5 seconds. Sounds about right.
Nobody's gonna talk about the cannibalism that happened at the end
😨
nah that's canniballsism
This is gojo vs sukuna before it happend 💀
And then he ate shadow. The end!
Why is shadow is bigger than sonic 😂
Who else remember watching this four years ago?
no way this was only 4 years ago
Average sonic boom episode
Was that vore at the end?
This is exactly how stardust crusaders went down.       Absolute CINEMA!
Kirby would win.
this is made me hungry
Shadow my cookie bear
4:25 I DONT WANNA BECOME A CHILI DOG I DONT WANNA
The  ending. _ .
He ate his rival as a hotdog???
Sonic’s toilet must HATE him.
So 3 Dog Night functions like the Darby Brothers’ stands.
the fact that bro eated the pit of the chilli dog at the bottom ☠
Rip shadow
Shadow: "No matter. Even if he does twitch in my world of stopped time. HE'S STILL IMMENSELY SLOWER THAN ME!!!"  *literally 6 seconds later*  Shadow: Proceeds to freak out when he sees sonic SLOWLY eating
Why is he saying time after time instead of chaos control?
Why like dio is the good guy this time?
1:05 can't help but notice the animation error, great quality though
I can feel the heartburn through the screen
Who is in 2025🎉🎉🎉
This is as accurate to a JoJo episode as it gets I love it??????
F no f no f
Sonic became a cannibal I guess then
Sonic's Stand is so silly and simple, yet so deceptively dangerous.  Forcing the enemy to fight on your terms in a contest where you naturally have an overwhelming advantage, is pretty nasty in general, but there are surprising layers to this challenge.  Shadow boasted that he was already as fast as Sonic, so Time After Time should have given him the edge, but, as Shadow admitted, and Sonic pointed out, Shadow doesn't like eating chili dogs, so being faster isn't always enough.  The world's fastest sprinter isn't necessarily going to win a hotdog eating competition against someone who loves eating hot dogs and has a huge appetite.  Shadow even started sounding nauseous from eating so much, so fast, towards the end, and he sounded/looked genuinely intimidated by the sight of the massive tower of food at the beginning.  Even if you're as fast or faster than Sonic, there's no guarantee that you could out-eat him, especially with such a huge pile to work through.  Plus, the fear factor of being turned into food yourself if you lose can also ruin your appetite.  It sounds so stupid, but its actually a really dangerous Stand in the right hands.  Which also fits with Jojo!
I wanted shadow say "oh your approaching me"
Nom nom nom nom nom nom
Where is sonics glubs
If they're this buff imagine tail😂 😮😀😎😃
Imagine they did more of this! Seeing other Sonic characters buff as hell & having unique Stands.
Absolute cinema
I love Yu-Gi-Oh Poker Night reused songs on this
i `m mean like shadow don`t care but sonic bros mutoh is watering
The ending 💀 ☠️ 💀
3 dog night is a great stand name
Should’ve just ate and kept shut.
Rare Footage of Sonic using his favorite thing as a power 0:59
Itd be cool if sonic got the powers of the user he ate or vice versa, since the conditions for his stand is so hard to fufill - it should probably have a high reward for whoever wins that chili dog challenge.
This always makes me crave chili dogs omfg
If Shadow didn't talk too much he could probably have won 😢
Sonic's name is Sonic JoJo?
I thought this was a fever dream when i remembered seeing bits of it
Would taking off his inhiter rings made a difference? I mean would it make Shadow's stand stronger or increase the time limit depending on how many rings Shadow took off?
U say speed but how about in hunger, shadow.
Well . . .   I'm grossed out.
As bad as turning into a sentient chilidog would be, and yeah that's surprising nightmare fuel right in itself....Sonic starts eating from the BOTTOM. Meaning Shadow not only gets eaten alive but the slow way. Fun details for that Mashed touch.
ANYONE 2025
Это не часть 3
Sonic just murdered Shadow! 😂
Musty results
4:10 I think it was both his love of Chili dogs _and_ his main ability of speed
why sonic sound like subbloxsworld
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can imagine this shadow as Jhon whick lol.
Sonic’s poor toilet..
Wait, so I see how Sonic got so buff, but what the hell has Shadow been fuelling his workouts with?
"Good afternoon campers, for today's challenge we gotta go fast"
Yknow considering part 6, three dog night is a completely plausible stand.
SONIC WHATAFU-!
If this was sonic3
I don’t remember this in the Sonic Movie 3…
I bet sonic can also mimic the stands of the people he turns into chilidogs and eats, but he just doesnt care about it and only wants the chilidogs
Pls I need a part two
I am here because of the short :)
As a fan of both, i see this as an absolute win
Whos watchin in 2024
fun fact, their stand names actually have actual song names as their name, "time after time" and "three dog night" are real songs too
anybody in 2025?
Whos in 2024?
Lol im watching jojo currently and this makes me laugh after watching it the 2nd time
It's official sonic is a cannibal
1:36 relatable crashout
Who still here in 2024
Bro
SONIC SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE THE NARATOR FROM SUBS WORLD
Sonic literally have time break soooo
At him ass first. In the words of classic sonic. "Gotta go fast! Gotta eat ass!"
You know shits serious when you can literally stop time and sonic says “so what?”
What is the song called?
I don’t wanna
Why they,are,so,buff😭
And sonic is faster than the chaos emerald
The fact that sonic didn’t stop in time for chili dogs.
...I want a chilidog now.
3:22 speed mode
Is that a JoJo reference!?!?
I forgot this exsisted thank you shorts 🎉
Why does sonic sound like sub from bloxs world?
Imagine your not a stand user and you see two huff hedgehogs eating the air,then all of a sudden you see shadow turn into a chili dog
You know what, I could go for a chillidog right about now
needs a sequel tbh
this shi is 4 years old now???
That would be the most terrifying stand to face.
Shadow, not actually knowing Sonic was a Stand user, told Sonic to observe his Stand, when non-Stand users cannot see them. Also, non-Stand users don’t know what a Stand is, so proudly proclaiming you have acquired one is pointless without further explanation.
2:16 ou sinon tu les mange pas et tu les cache 😂😂😂😂😂
VORE?!
Like a monster her eats him toes first
Not gonna lie, this actually look cool.
That’s at least 3 Möbian stand users.  The third is Storm, as shown in the SnapCube _Sonic Riders_ Fandub. His stand, currently unnamed, can replace the air within a certain radius with water.
I wish I went back in time to watch this in 2020.
God why is shadow  like a aimne version  as jojo aimne  2:13 3:05  it's like his villain 3:55 3:55 😩
This is way better than gametoons ngl, lol
lost the chance to make shadows stand be one that evolves, first form called "I am" and second "All of me" and sonics be called "Live and Learn"
turning shadow into a living chili dog and eating him is creepy af.
I have finally watched jojo, and now this makes more sense.
4:29 now I feel bad for shadow,bro was begging not to be a chilli dog 😔
Sonic was wrong he could not sustain eating chille dogs at Sonic speed.
Bro knuckle is so buff if their that  buff 😂
Now thats bizarre
(NOTE) this is PROBABLY the first mashed video i've watched since probably 2021, idk what year I watched it.
Bro sonic ate shadows chilly balls
I swear to god every single one of these TSA sonic verse stories is just some wild shit ripped from a sonic erotica fanfic newsgroup
Ele comeu o irmão que errado e la ele kkkk 😅
I never realized the parallel between the two
I look at Sonic vs Shadow animations a lot and this is just normal to me (except for the part when Shadow got turned into a chili dog and eaten by sonic)
wtf
The heck
hahahaha shadow
STOP WHY IS SHADOW AND SONIC SO FINE???
This is the best thing ive ever watched
Anyone in 2024 👇
Is this yugioh
The most normal fanfic of sonic
Sup
Talk about Sonic the hedgehog meets JoJo's bizarre adventure stardust crusaders
Did you guys not read the manga?
Sonics voice reminds me of something.
5:06 😅😅
Why did I read jojo siwa vs  shadow???
Stand: 3 dog night User: olgilvile maurice "sonic" hedgehog Stand type: natural humanoid (the man) , non natural non humanoid (the hot dog stand), natural non humanoid (the chilidogs), competition Apearance: 3 dog night is made of 3 components, a hot dog stand, the man operating the stand, and the chilidogs. Ability: 3 dog night is a competition, where the first who eats 1000 chilidogs wins, and the loser is turned into a chilidog. Anticheat: if someone tries to use their stand to cheat in the competition, the man will slowly but surely make the cheating less efective to the point that it doesnt really work anymore. Stats: Power: n/a Defense: n/a Speed: n/a Potential: C Acuracy: B Range: n/a
It’s funny how Shadow was defeated by food.
What a bizarre and epic Jojo x sonic video.
Shadow Vs Sonic
This is better than the real anime 😂
Sonic , shadogh jlladdff
Shadows edgeworth
Something about sonic's stand reminds me of the hot dog 🌭 vendor from sonic unleashed ps3
Bro ate his own kind
Who?
I remember when i first watched this omg😭😭
5:04 That, and also he was talking too much, normal for a jojo's villian i guess
Knuckles: The power of the stand Chaos is i time- Shadow: Chaos control! stop the time!
Imagine if Cream's Stand will be Ella 😂
Dang now im hungry
1:35  so what😒
Amazing Sonic animation Mashed and also Shadow saying "time after time" but Sonic is too fast for Shadow.
<3 :) ^_^ 100% A+
conclusion: love chili dogs😋
Bro sonic cant stop time but he can make hot dogs
Shadow may be able to stop but he can’t stop his mouth.
This Is Jojo Bizarre Adventure
Sonic x shadow generations be like:
best thing i've ver seen
2:31 What does it mean?
They lost opportunity to call stand crush 40 and smh like Crush 40 : All of me
How tf Is it the ultimate stand if the time it stops is five seconds?
5:09 damn I know sonic liked shadow, but not in the way that we wanted to eat his black MEAT
Voice of Shadow by RicanFly. Damn good job
Now I want chilli dogs.
now sonic knows how shadow taste like
This still remains, to this day, an absolute masterpiece.
I am in disgrace to the regiment
Dio vs jotaro under  sonic vs shadow
3:21
He's gonna be shittin Shadow
Bro is eating them glizzys faster than i can su-nevermind
Shadow the chillidog
Nah sonic's a glizzy gobbler💀
Shadow Dio
Yeah I remember this when I was 9 or 8
I think I remember this
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure x Sonic the Hedgehog 🦔
i love how his stand is literally just a minimum wage guy
It been 3 years when are you making a part 2
Za warduo and star platinum
sillydog!!!!!😍😍😍🥰🥰🤩🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭
"You are what you eat, Sonic,"
I haven't watched a second of JoJo, but mashed is making me a fan already.
Who is here in 2023?
💪 🗿 💪
Time After Time? Never knew Shadow was a fan of Cyndi Lauper...
That’s me when I eat my favorite food😂😂🤣🤣
Sonic is WINNER !!
4:06-4:10 Shadow has realized he's done for. this is so epic ngl
no sonic means after he wins you get turned into a di-
no se que vi pero me gusta
thats the most intense hot dog eating contest I've ever seen
The Real Ending: After This Wacky Nonsense Sonic Ended Up In The Hospital Discovering a New Type of Diabetes. Or Just Dying Because Of How Fat he Must've Gotten. { Edit: SONICS A CANNIBAL CONFIRMED, Those Spikes Must've Stabbed His Internal Organs, X546, Or How Many Spikes Are On A Hedgehog }
Was this part 1 or 3 I can’t tell
Za warldo
Ko no Dio da
Classic odd jojo analogy
2:51 Someone hasn't watched Stone Ocean. There's a cooldown between time stops in JoJo. Though the exact time frame is never specifically stated IIRC.
0:35 0:59 3:05 Shadow laughing
NAH SONIC JUST ATE HIS OWN KIND
0:09 That's the one I was dreaming   about Shadow looks so buff with his muscles and we went to the sunset beach together.
Hahahahahha sonic is from jojo bizarre
I’ve never seen Jojos but this was a masterpiece
Cannibalism?
Shadow the chili dog
Yeah it’s definitely normal for a person to bite off and devour another persons head and neck and mostly consume the rest of the  body too……yeah totally normal
Dude, this design of the boys... I LIKE IT!! :D
*clears my throat again* whoops i was meant to say is my FAVORITE Chilli-dog is Chilli CHEESE dog WITH ken's steak house honey mustard :)
*clears my throat* my favorite food is chili CHEESE dog with Ken's steak house honey mustard <3 :) ^_^
Vore....
My favourite moment is when Sonic eats Shadow's sausage.
I kinda feel bad for shadow now that he lost
Imagine Shadow would see me AND THEN HE DOES SOMETHING SUS WHILE HE'S BUFF-
I'ts look so funny
What the fuck did I just watch?
Woah..did sonic just eat shadows chili dog!?
He could just destroy those chilli dogs and eat one and boom he won
What better way to end an epic final than by having your protagonist commit cannibalism and eat the villain.
If Sonic and ONE PIECE collided, Sonic would’ve eaten the Chili Chili no Mi
can you make a japanese version
Eggman's Sonic's stand!?
Poor shadow :(
Is this story for kids ？
Is this story ？
If they eat too much chilli dogs, they never fat ？
They eat chilli dogs race ？
Shadow eating chilli dogs, hahahahahahahaha！
I actually feel bad for this version of Shadow
Uuyyyyy
holy sheesh is this a jojo reference?
The voice acting is so good
Where "ORA! ORA! ORA! ORA! ORA!" ?
i feel like i hear sonics va before
Bruh time after time not za world or chaos control
Holy shit! Is that a mothefucking JOJO referance?!
Shadow might have won if he hadn't been chattering so much. 😆
Sonics voice sounds familiar.
Is that a JOJO reference?
Moral of the story: Sonic x Shadow
3:04 what is the name of this ost?
WHATF SONIC AND SHADOW...
2:02 Readyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy..... STAAAART
3 Dog Knight"
Throughout this video, all I kept thinking was ‘Geez Shadow, shut the hell up!’
If they are this buff.. imagine tails?
There is only one reason..... Sonic is still Archie sonic.
Sonic y shadow mamadisimos
Ngl, I thought this was a a music video about Sonic vs. Shadow
I noticed something sonic has a necklace with one ring could it be the single ring vampire lady gave him in the r34 video hhhh
Shadows creation looks ugly why did you make this
Omg knuckles would be massive if he was there s buff
Top 3 anime
Bro sonic is a cannibalism by watching this he ate another hedgehog
Divino🌠
*scoffs* big deal i eat Chilli cheese dogs with honey mustard
Sonic VORES Shadow
Jotaro as Sonic Dio as Shadow
should of done more eating and less talking
bro why he bit the chilidog from below 💀💀
So, Sonic's stand is the same type as Atum and Osiris?
5:08 OHH MYY GAAHHHH
Do you know that Sonic can get even stronger than his hyperform it's true hyper it's a super powerful energy field when he uses all the objects to turn into different forms and combine them all including the Master Emerald to become true hypersonic
Well... I certainly didn't expect Sonic's stand to be... whatever that was...
bro
hmmm
I saw shadow being young with out his ears
Shadows last words was noooooooooooo
1:23 NANI
I love chilli dogs!
6.9m views
I want a sequel
r.i.p shadow
Poor shadow
Wow he loves Chilli dogs so much
I mean, knuckles can lift 100-500tons (google search). So this means that if they are all 5 times as strong, that means knuckles can hold about as much as 4 of the Statue of Liberty, with his pinky.
I like how when theyre grabbing chili dogs, its like the dio fast punching
ok hear me out guys
This felt like Yu-gi-oh.
time afft time
The Phantom Chao: Tikal  Doom Tendency: Shadow (before stasis)  Chaos Crusaders: Sonic T Hedgehog  Emerald is Invincible: Knuckles  Golden Wings: Miles Tails Prower  Angel Ocean: Sally Acorn  Sol Gem Run: Blaze  Mobiuslion: Silver  The Moebius Lands: Scrouge
So he ate Shadows chili dog
Shut up
Sad bro sad
:)
Man he really ate hi
Sonic tasted the inferior part of Shadow with his mouth 0_o
Sonic versus Shadow who will win Sonic he's the good one he's the version of Sega he'll be all the chili dogs
When shadow said “time after time” I kept waiting for that song to play
4:40
4:39
3:30
3:05
2:15
1:50
1:14
IMagine Big that buff BOY HE GIGANTIC
this turned into a anime lol
I kind of feel bad for shadow 😔  Bro sounded so scared of being turned into a chilli dog
Shadow like dio and sonic is like Jonathan Jostar
Shadow looks good. I need an anime in this style
Waiting for 6,9 million views
Man I wish I have that chef man that create chili dog for sonic(that I can eat chili dog forever without wasting money)
This is just the final battle of Stardust Crusaders summarized in five and a half minutes
Can you make a part 4 of something about Amy plz ?
maybe if he wouldnt monologue every 5 seconds he couldve damn won
Did he… did he just eat Shadow? Also, *IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!*
So...does this count as hedgehog canabalism or?? I mean those eyes did blink so...
I am reacting this
Sonic is canonically a cannible now
Why was the fact that he sonic ate shadow the chillydog from the END of him!? That’s real SUS!
I wanna see more of jojo shadow vs sonic is the best for me!!!!!!!
He ate shadows hotdog
did sonic just eat Shadows Chilli dog? 😳😳
ip

«  Our battle will be legendary! «
anime time stop 5 seconds actually its like 22 seconds its so un accurate
Oh shoot there's going to be starting this who's going to win
Oh no holy shit
And sonic is jotaro
Shadow is dio
This is beautiful
chaos control
Why is this so perfect?!?!
I wonder who was shooting the arrow
JoJo's Sonic Adventure
Couldn't Shadow Already Stop time?
sonic is soooooo hot now ty😊😍🥰
Jojonic
WAIT WHAT THATS CANNIBALISM
Do a part 3 with Silver, I wanna see what silver looks like in JoJo form
Pelo visto o Sonic comeu o Shadow (literalmente)
…. 😅ok this is totally not weird
Why does Sonic sound like Sub or EmKay? I got a glimpse of Sub when he said "Mysterious arrow" Also, I think this is taking place in Shamar? Love that Sonic Unleashed reference.
Hahahahhahahah, there's 2 identical plates of chilli dogs! Funniest thing i've ever seen!
Woah cannibalism 😑
fianley the prefct anime
Why do i sound like sub the youtuber
*Time after time, as we march side by side,* *Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls.* *Night after night, for the glory we fight,* *In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old!*  Edit: Cry Thunder - Dragonforce
These are low key demented af
😘
Мы тебя любим Соник мышцы
DIO VS JOTARO LOL
poor shadow
I feel like this counts as cannibalism (at least the last part)
Alternative title: Diamondhead vs Mario
Shadow looks more like a giga chad then a hedgehog.
Hedgehog turns into a chilli dog Funniest shit I've ever seen
PLEASE🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Can you make a sequel to your latest Sonic video
Are we ignoring the fact that Sonic just committed cannibalism?
سونك البي
I love how the stand powers perfectly match their characters:  Shadow’s the Ultimate Lifeform, so he wants the Ultimate Power. Stopping time is pretty much that   Sonic’s full of himself, too, but in the other direction. He honestly doesn’t care, and would rather do things his own way, and let others do it their way. His stand has almost no Combat potential, but it doesn’t need to have any, because he’s so sure of his abilities that he’s fine regardless
shadow: of work very? Shadow.. Shadow exe: ... Shadow: ummmmm.... exe Shadow exe: no JD and okay I.... Shadow: no no no noooooo Shadow exe: Hahaha
i just use CC i can see it but. why is it jojo here  Sonic jojo: idk? Me: *BRUH*
I’d like to see Eggman with these muscles 💪🏾
The Dio metaphors are just great, his monologue felt like it was something Dio would actually say lmao comparing him to a waitress or whatever
You are crazy thes no knuckles
if shadow just didnt talk he would win
"I don't wanna become a chili dog! I don't wanna!" Remains one of my favorite  YouTube quotes of all time. Right along with "Have you guys ever seen a goldfish shit?"
Knuckles would be an ultimate brute.. imagine that.
Me eating 1000000000 cheetos be like: 2:00
Its good and funny😊🎉
Shadow is crazy😂😂😂
Why does sonic sound like Chris from total drama island
Yugioh gx tag force
Now I really wanna see if more of this will come up. I love it so much
Oh my god
WHY IS SHADOW KINDA….. 😳😳😳😳😳
Shilli shog
so, if shadow needs hover boots to match sonics speed, doesn't that mean he's slower?
Bro I only just noticed this after 5 times of watching this video. Time after time has the 7 canoe emeralds as him
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴🥱
NOOOOOO SHADOW
2:00 Sonic is a huge mood if I look up great food on the internet. ☺️
i want more of this
Sonic vored Shadow!? 👀
Knuckles has the emerald splash thats just shoots master emeralds
You know what they say. Don’t speak while eating
" *So it's the same stand as time after time.* "
the mysterious arrow hit shadow in the head, so he got the most powerful stand he could imagine. Sonic got hit in his torso(stomach) so he got what his stomach wanted
This is how i started watching jojo
I can't believe that. He actually ate him
Watching on 2x Speed Playback is like being on ACID
You should've named this "Sonic's Bizarre Adventure 2"
Did sonic eat shadow as a chili dog!?..
Hedgehog's bizarre adventure part 4: Emerald is unbreakable
Stop ruining jojo
When shadow said “i don’t want to be a chilli dog’ he sounded sad
Is that a JoJo reference
Sonic has star platinum and shadow has the world
I like hot dogs
Funny thing is, the chili dog stand actually does sound like a stand that would appear in Jojo
Shadow is literally immortal since he’s the ultimate life form. I can’t believe it’s even possible for you to even think that shadow could be a JoJo reference 💀
😇😇
So... i guess tails is the first donut, knuckles is fire men and joseph is idk.
um
AYO where is he eating at 5:06
Sonic Sonic and Amy Sonic and Amy
ora? :(
I just realized that stands and nen are very similar
lol the arrow in his head tho  and sonic got shot in da butt with an arrow and i love how shadows stand is the chaos emeralds and did he just take a bite out of shadows butt? even if he turn into hot dog
Is that a jojo reference
Worst I've ever seen
I absolutely love the heck outta this so much! Not just the art or the dialogue, but i can see the amount of patience, blood, sweat and tears that was put into making this amazing video. That being said, awesome job.👍😁
Shadow, you have all the chaos emeralds just go super idiot.
Ngl sonic and shadow look cool in the jojo art style especially that eye blocking shadow it looks cool
I don't to watch the video I know it first Shadow make a challenge to Sonic to eat chili dog's see I knew it it was EZ! Bro and Shadow got a time after time!
Sonic's voice is super accurate.
They look handsome ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😅
Sonic:Jotaro  Shadow:Dio
He ate Shadow’s wiener
I didn't Like this.
If it were Archie Sonic, he could just reverse time against Time After Time
My favorite part is when sonic says you didn’t love chili dogs  5:04
shadow get eatin' lol
You gotta realise that if shadow had just kept eating instead of talking while time after time was activated, he would have won.
Perfect animation ✅ Magnificent voice acting ✅ Outstanding lore ✅  This is a certified Sonic movie classic
"Chow"~lenge~
Thats amazing i think that coming here and watchit again is something i dont regret, also even when shadow said that they are fast as equal that wasnt right because hes a more faster than sonic and whitout the rings he could be even faster but nevermind Continue like this
BRUH THIS A HOLE AS$ JO JO REFERENCE
this is by far the most intense hotdog eating contest I ever seen
Ok thats a dark ending to me
Sorry, but sonic sounds like he’s about to say… “Sub, do you hate it when pros break into your base? Well, this time we are turning the tables. Now we are going to hide in a pro base for, 10 DAYS! But first we need to make sure that the pro is out of his base, so we can break in and hide.
Oh no he ate shadow cannibal true shadow loves chili hamburgers instead
When you realise that shadow here is shadio
the ending should have been your too slow
He ate shadow? 😶
Yo

Hot dog man: /e summon 100000000 chilly dogs
Pov: when jojo and dio make a deal with shadow and sonic but they get different stands
Shadows stand are the chaos emeralds
Shadow. Maybe if you stopped talking amd kept eating, you could have one. In your words. That was... PATHETIC
Dude why does this fit so well with sonic and shadow
You shouldn’t have done the least bit we’re sonic ate shadow
Ultimate Life Form... I want to see Shadow facing Kars, Jojo's Ultimate Life Form. :D
The time after time one tho.... isk but it looks. Off
the little sanity i had left is now gone as i question why i love this video so much...............        help T^T
Sonic's voice is familiar to sub
so coolllllllL!
Why though.
I’m kinda hoping jojo sonic appears in the Sonicverse rap
They be buff
Time After Time Power: A Speed: A Range: C Durability: B Precision: B Potential: A  Three Dog Night Power: none Speed: A Range: E Durability: A Precision: E Potential: A

LOLLLL WHEN SHADOW TURNSI NT OHCILI DOG!!!!!!! SO FUNNY!!1
Is that a JoJo reference!!!
SoSo's Bizzare Adventure
This is an excuse for sonic just to eat hotdogs
Cool Dude
I love how sonic’s gluttony won
If shadow stopped talking he would have won
Funny how shadow had a 7 chaps emerald stand and still lost to a chili dog eater
5:07
Why do bad guys always think they are the ultimate lifeform? Meanwhile either next season there's a bigger bad guy orits just clear that they have a brain of a peanut
Shadow was so angry.-. And her man was a Cristal. But sonic have a hotdog man? And why hotdog man giving hotdogs to shadow and sonic?          She wants to 1v1 shadow and sonic? Guys below on comments T_T I don't know why.
I just realized "time after time" its the name or the lyri of an song, i dont remember the name of the band, but still funi
2:01 sonic is hungry and wants to eat all the chilli dogs
I just had a three course meal, and this just made me real damned hungry for some chili dogs no cap about it.
👍😍🤝👏
The ending is sus 😂
UHHH SONIC AND SHADOW HAVE ABS ...😂😂😂😂😂😂SERIOUSLY SHADOWS SPIRIT IS SOMEKIND OF CHAOS EMERALDS MAN AND SONICS IS A HOTDOG MAN
Eata eata eata (muda muda muda)
I have one. How about doing a video from the game Jump Force
Imagine losing while you can stop time. Smh.
Eating chilli dogs while watching this.
wait does sonic become a cannibalist when he eats shadow that turned into hot dog?
Sneaking my hero we are the best in the world
Chillies dog seller is new stand
Sonic’s stand is the best way to get diabetes
Cool
Amy: Oh Yes, Yes! He's Hot!
Jotaro Squirrel Jotaro Goat Jotaro Wolf
Imagine dr egg as pucci vs sonic
What did they use to animate?
I would like to point out that as Shadow did not have any chili OR cheese on him, he was turned into a hotdog, not a chili dog.
XD
4:54 shadow turned into a chilli dog because he failed and Sonic ate it
Man Shadow as a chili dog is probably extra spicy. Nice animation btw! It is obvious you put so much effort into it!
hotdogs my favorite
Shadow Chiledog
I thought stop time is called chaos control
good ask?
if shadow spent half the time of his monolouging he'd win
Sonic you sound like sub plays
Ficaram lindos demais 💙🖤
She just ate it thats shadow
THE WOOOOOLD
Jojo bruh time after time is broken
I remember watching this in the holiday of 2020
Sonic limit is at least 100,00,000
Joseph Joestar as sonic. he can nigerundayo at the speed of sound
Shadow is funny when he was a hot dog😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
nice art
This is my impression of sonic, I looooove chili dogs!
Oooooooo.
Shadow dog :)
Shadow is jataro and sonic is dio
Sonic: You're too slow.
Sonic is a cannibal. He ate Shadow alive. Also he's into vore.
Omg yes
Is there a stand that can defeat Sonic and 3 Dog Night?
no me gusto como lo puso sus puerpos estan raros 😔
the fact that sonic ate shadow's bottom first is because that is where the you know what is so shadow can expereience the most pain and have the most chili dog screams
Even as a guy who doesn’t liek anime, I love this
Chili dogs
Luffy can defeat him in an second
I don’t watch Jojo but this might be interesting…
I love it and I love sonic
Jojo reference
Wait, Shadow's Stand ability is to do something he could already do without a stand?
Why does this seem more like Kaiba v Yugi?
Can someone explain how exactly sonic was able to move in stoped time?
I like how Sonics stand is basically Boy II Man
Is that technically canablisim
I was waiting for the chaos control thing
This is amazing..yet..Sadly anyone that fals vicitm to Sonic's stand..will be his meal!
How do you stop time for five seconds when time is stop?
That gotta be the worst way to die: eating alive
SA2 Sonic: ILL MAKE YOU EAT THOSE WORDS!  Jojo Sonic: THOSE WORDS MADE ME EAT YOU!
🔥, 🙏📹🤣🦃🙏🤧⚠️🐲🤣
Sonic is jotaro And Shadow is DIO
So it’s the same type of stand as 3 dog Knight
cheesy yet so SO funny
I know this is JoJo but why does shadow look like edgeworth from phoenix wright?
Using chaos control as time after time and having it made of chaos emeralds was genius
freedognight
Chandni Kochi doing
I love your videos and can you come here because I want to play
But I love you 😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
I love you video
Gane
Sainik I love you video
5:08 oh my god sonic just vored shadow
i wanted it to be snba
Ok but like, why does Time After Time sound like a real jojo stand?
Sonic just committed cannibalism
How is shadow not fat
Hahaha
im know its video BUT WHY HIM BOTH DIDNT GET FAT ??????????????????????????????????????😠
Naw shadow would be jotaro
"he turned himself into a chilidog tails, funniest shit ive ever seen"
I haven't laughed so much in a long time, thanks for that, the comedy in this video is just perfect
Shadow the hatdog🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sonic Shadow why they were so muscular
I hat Shadow and I lcke you Sonic the hedehog
Badass anime: check Badass game: check Badass version of food wars: check ✔
Shadow The Hedgedog
shadow talks too much. Also are we going to ignore the fact that sonic ate shadow? Sonic is a cannibal confirmed.
Shadow cheat still can not beet Sonic
0:23 So it’s the same type of stand as Star platinum
sonic has the legendary stand I love jojo hazard adventure
shadow has 6 chaos emerald and the 7th chaos emerald = the damn fourth chaos emerald lol
Most Powerful Stand
i like this also i subscribed u
Big black hedgehog
Mf didnt realize he can just add extra hotdogs to sonic right?
That was a very good video 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😻
MUDAMUDA, ZA WARUDOOOO
Drip
Did he just eat shadow’s weine-
Jojo 2.0 Be like
I have discovered that jojo sonic is canibal
thEY BEEN HITTEN THE GYM
"how fast can a hedgehog eat chili dogs" questions science cant answer
if there was a sonic jojo, this probably would legit happen
He eats shadow the hedgehog wait if shadows a hadgehoge that's means sonic is commiting cannibalism
Diavolo Death No. 94675 Turned into chili dog and eaten by Sonic
We Need More   Is it a series?
Sonic kinda sound like steve from the videos
Boo!
Sonic unleashed sonic the werehog battle them eating chicken and the next time you the video games 🎮 🕹 👌 😋 🤣 😂 🎮 🕹 👌.
Qqqqqaqaqa  k kn
WHY DO Sonic WIN😡
maybe if shadow stopped talking, he would have won
Por caca
This is disturbing to look at
"Noooo, I don't wanna be chilly dog..."  *punch smashing sounds
Meanwhile in Sonic JoJo Part 4: Emerald Is Unbreakable  Sonic Kujo:  *THREE DOG NIGHTS: TIME AFTER TIME!*
1:03 look at Sonic hand!
His monologuing too much XD
sonic eats shadow's hotdog
Food compition more than an fight
i feel like it would be fitting if its called sonics bizarre adventure
The funny part is that archie sonic is immune to time stopping so this video is accurate
Sonic going go Sonic go Sonic
Sonic vs Shadow  Chili dog JoJo  Contest
Eeeeeee eeeeeee
5:00
Isn’t Sonic’s voice Sub’s Blox World announcer?
Chili cheese and hotdogs
5:08 IS THAT CANNIBALLISM
Part of me is upset he doesn’t say zawardo
Lol
Nada mal me gusta 😌
I watch this while eating hotdogs.
Is that not caniballism
Sonic is good at family Dollar
There is one reason you lost shadow. One. Simple. Reason… Your, too, slow.
Chili dog shadow
Jojo shadow: i have the strongest stand in the world!!!  Dio and the world: is this a challenge?
Sonic his never stop💯👏😎
Do sliver the hedgehog
why- me no like buff sonic
e
i watched this video before i watched JOJO and didn't get the reference
Part 3 stands vs part 8
Rip shadow
Shadow became a prosecutor like Miles Edgeworth apparently
BHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAH ITS SO FUNNY
Idk what to do with this....
Shippers at 5:07: “SONADOW CONFIRMED!? OMG AAAAAAAA”
Where sonic bit the Shadow chili dog tho
Why does sonic sound like Owen from total drama island
I mean, still better than Sonic Boom.
this was the single best piece of art i have ever seen in my life
This was great man , id actually love if this was an actual episode of sonic lolll
Mmm, Dilfs.
I LOVE HOT DOGS
Wow.
So it's a similar stand to the world?
Now that I've started watching Jojo, this makes alot more sense
i watched this before and after i got into anime and now this makes so much sense XD
HMMMMMMM from subs videos a voice that is talking to sub in minecraft sounds familiar with sonics voice
This is a furry vore animation.
Time after time was an excellent stand name from a good song well done mashed!
Everybody gangsta until sonic.exe. arrives
Wtf
literally shadow should of just killed sonic and won lol
Ironically this is normal by jojo standards
Sonic face  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Chilli dogs!
I love hot dog is my favourite and chill dog
the young waitress part really sounds like something dio would say sense he says “your like a!” a lot.
Steve From the Minecraft Movie voice acted Sonic????
Me on a test 3:20
Shadow should say:Chaos Control
why do u always make them all muscly and stuff
Hol' up! People without stands can't see them, so why was Shadow suprised to hear that Sonic has a stand?
Foolish shadow, he really thought he could defeat somebody with plot armor
This is a cool preview for the 2022 Sonic game!
Random thought if other sonic characters had stands I think they’d be called  Tails- blinded by science  Egg man- weird science  Knuckles- 10,000 emerald pools Amy- maniac Sticks- wild for the night Cream- big time Cheese- rock me Amadeus
Sonic sounds like Owen from Total Drama Island
L
"There's only one reason why you lost, Shadow. There's just one simple answer.  "You're too slow."  (the line I was expecting from 4:57)
Sonic is like jotaro but not depressed
709
Is it me or is the Hot Dog guys looks a LOT like Dr. Eggman?
HIS PASSION FOR CHILLI DOGS IS TO POWERFUL
why does sonic sound like Chris McLean
Sonic sounds like Skipthetutorial
I love how shadow wears dios costume
Why does sonic sound like that guy from sub’s world
Ayyyy, hot dog guy man a cameo in the video.
perfect idea: send this to vegan teacher.
This made me watch jojo I won't lie
Who’s here after watching FNF BIZARRE ANIME ADVENTURE?
Zawaruado
I Think its a jojo reference you guys
You know. They really missed their chance to call shadow's stand "chaos control"
I would like to point out that sonic has a ring tied to his neck at all times so in theory if it never comes off he is immortal

Time After Time and Three Dog Knight are actual musical references ... this video is perfect in so many levels omfg
Само анимэ классное и ржачное, но лучше бы персонажей озвучивали по-японски, тогда было бы ваще отменно)))
John is to try to go to joshes to

Funny thing about this is this actually seems pretty accurate to the show.
Funny that shadow could have won if he had just stfu
Guys, notice that in 3:03 Sonic eyes are normal. But as soon as Shadow says he hates Chili Dogs, his eyes turn black, et eats in stoped time and speeds up dramatically.
yare yare daze
Well Sonic did get his stand by his capability
TIME AFTR TIME AHHHHHHHHHHHHNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI NOT WONT TO BE A CHELY DOG NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo 4:32
Sonic joutarou  Shadow dio  Knuckles polnarefu  Tails kakyuin
Looking back, the best part about this is “Time After Time” is named like an actual stand. The names are usually song references.
"ZA WARUDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"SONIC IS EATING!" This ended me.
I remember watching you back in 2017 man, your animations are incredible!
Sa
How did they get big and 💪
I Love sonic
You’re so cool show ever worst show ever
Hi there is this new thing you could use for me to call you in person to help you call
“Man, I could really go for some chili dogs right now” -Anonymous Youtuber’s last words, 2021
Chill dogs
Shadow's got a cool stand that looks with the Chaos Emeralds, but when he stops time, he could've said "Chaos Control!"
Imagine chaos emerald world and hot dog platinum
Sonic's Speedy Adventure: Fastest Crusaders
Shadow: IM SHADOW THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORM!!!! *Sonic wins* Shadow: *NANI*
Sonic's Stand was a guy who runs a hotdog stand. Nice :)
Shadow.   isn’t.    Good at.  It
So isnt that cannibalism 5:08
The voice of the shadow is simply divinely voiced. In my opinion...
Shadow cheat but sonic still win sonic is the fastest thing alive sonic also said thai all the time
shadow got eatten
How’d sonic move in shadow’s world of  stopped time
Final assustador 😫😫😫😫😔😔☹😨😨😨😨😡😡😡🤢🤢🤢🤢🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hhhhhhhhh
Shadow, you lost because you pissed me off and you hate chili dogs ! XD
This sounds like the guy from sub excabite
To be honest all stands are useful if you use them correctly
this is so epic
why...
Awww poor Shadow, I kinda felt that when he said: "I don't wanna become a chilli dog, I don't WANNA!"   edit: never got this many likes, SHEEESSSSSHHH
And now I'm Hungry
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
UnFunniest shit ever
disturebing..

What the HELL?
Pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Is Sonics voice actor the one for bluemonkeys Steve or maybe skipthetutorial
“So it’s the same as time over time..?”
Mmmmmmmmm, cannibalism.
Chill dogs was said 11 times
I like the fact that like in jojo their stand names are musical references too
I just reallized that at 1:05 we can see sonic with a glove, but the next scene, he doesn't have it
Is it me or sonic sounds like that narrator  guy from subs world
Is that a jojo reference
T
Shadow's voice is like Vegeta
100k
)
Ha showdow his weak at time
So the only way to beat sonic is with speed, which is why made in heaven is the perfect match (Also it’d destroy the chilli dogs)
Goddamn, the people you got to do the voice acting are fucking perfect
EH
Eqqqqpppp
I love how this is an ad

Sonic and shadow had to just get fat after that
Shadow: I was so weak before until I took a arrow at the head.
Sonic sounds just like Peter Knetter when he acts like Sliver.
Cannibal ending.

Five seconds or five minuts? This is the rules of any anime
That's Steve's voice bruh
LOLOLOLOL HOT DOGS LOLOLOL
What's weird is shadow can technically already stop time with a chaos emerald so his stand wouldn't really be beneficial
Talking so loud
Oh my God shadow
Lskk
I love how the Stands are loosely related to music, much like how there were music references in Jojo’s bizarre adventures.
Jajajajajaja0/////////////0
0:05 uuuuuuuuuuuuh I dont think amy will look... like..... that
Archie comics already did this
Shadow = Kars
🤔
i hate jojo, i hate anime
Fun fact: in the new idw  sonic comics there IS an ACTUAL jojo reference
Sonic has won
Damn I'd like to hear the music alone,it is so nice :/
Holy crap sonic sounds like jo jo’s English voice actor
Add a public comment...
Kono Shadow da!
Why dio sounds like dio brando is what I’m trying to understand like how did you do that
Just remember,sonic acts like and talks like Owen from total drama island
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
the battle was so intense making diavolo’s fight go into shame making diavolo commit suicide therefore making this canon
Time after time Would not be able to defeat sonic
I think shadow is jojo is it?

Maybe Shadow could've won if he didnt spend 5 minutes of his 5 second time stop monologing
Good lord, Sonic! If you’re gonna eat Chilidog Shadow, at least eat the head first so he doesn’t suffer! 😱
Only now have i noticed that they are fighting in Shamar because jotaro and dio fight in egypt. Genius
Sonic cool and the most popular with it

Shadow could already stop time with chaos control.
Really......its a nightmare
sorry to say this but i dont like the video really sorry 🙄🙄🙄😔😔😔
the fact that i love both of these and this channel is amazing
Sonic and shadow have the wrong clothes
Sonic voice it's like from sub

They are so buff 💪
Shadow Brando and Sonic Kujo whats next Knuckles Kakyoin

How to beat this use the time stop to take a sip of monster energy
Sonic is a cannibal :O
i love sonic
Nate
You gotta realise that if shadow had just kept eating instead of talking while time after time was activated, he would have won.
I hope this is on Netflix
Time after crime is the world
Love how this Shadow sees Sonic as not just some fool but a true equal, rather than saying sonic's his equal he gives a nod and acknowledges hes Sonics equal in speed as speed is his"In speed I'm YOUR equal" Yes I've never felt the touch of a woman.
5:08 ...i am trying not to imagine that since the eyes and hair is in the other side of the chili dog
it`s a freakin parody
Sonic bizzare
There is actually a jojo reference in sonic
Wow
4:24 thats what you get for cheating
TIME AFTER TIME!
Did someone put rockets in shadows arms he's not actually fast his shoes HAS rockets that MAKES him fast
My therapist: ShaDio Brando and Jonic Joestar aren't real, they can't hurt you. ShaDio Brando and Jonic Joestar: ...
SONIC WILL BE FAT I MEAN LOOK AT HIS FACE
SONIC WILL BE FAT
Shadow sonic don’t fight you can be friends again right?
When you realize sonic is a jojo reference
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if Sonics stand talks with Sonic because he can
drawn out a bit too long but sick animation
When you realise that shadow had his power limiters on
The is only one reposan why you lost shadow you posted the fuck out of me
There  yum
Dio shadow vs jotaro sonic
0:29 DIO: Oh? So you still want to fight.

Imagine having sonic's stand
haha shadow is eated
Shadow could've easily won if he stopped laughing and monologuing every goddamn 5 seconds
E
Hmm this sonic sounds sub
👌👌👌👌
U mean ts/time stop and why it eat like sonic ora ora ora ora ora ora oraaaaaa shadow muda muda muda mudaaaaaa
Is this a Sonic reference?
5:01 [INTERNALLY SCREAMING]
5 seconds is essentially a long time to stop time I mean you get jumped and your fast you could 1 use it to just book it or just take anyone out I would want that power
Obese sonic now think about the image that pops into your head
Your post to turn to a super form right  Your post to turn into a super forward to eating fast
Hah! More like the most pathetic one!😂😂😂
When your mom makes the best  Frioles and your cousin is over
ChilliHog
Is sonic has a real stand I can fight that will be so awesome by battle shadow but nope hot dog Knight that was disappointing ;-;
Hello
Son: mom can we get sonic x mom: we have sonic x at home  sonic x at home:
1:49 How did the chilli dogs fit lol 😂😂😂
It would’ve been better if shadows stand was named chaos control
Sonic Vs. Shadow
Anyone else felt like eating a chili dog after watching this?
Lesson learned : theu got diarrhea after the eating competetion
sonic
Dang *BIG MUSCLES
Sonic's stand is more like a nen ability
Fun fact: There is actual song named "Time After Time", which makes this even more funnier cuz they probably tried to come up with a simple original name, yet they ended up calling it by song's name which is Jojo canon.
.
It makes sense that shadow is gone (cuz hes dio and dios dead)
i wonder what chill shadow dog tastes like
Time after Time [Cyndi Lauper song] Three Dog Night [Rock band]
Like Dio THEY FUCKING TALK TOO MUCH
Why does sonic sound like chills (the youtuber)
Sonic ate his own kind
You thought it was Shadow but it was I, DIO!
Donna does not have boobies😂😂😂😂😂
YYY YYY YYY YYY why
Plot twist : sonic assent even trying
Stop. Shadow
I don’t wanna be come a chilly dog I DONT WANNA
If Sonic did not love Chili-dogs  Shadow could have won  Shadow is better than that blue Faker
I love that the loss of shadow played like in the anime with DIO, because if he stopped blabbering and ate he would have won.
Anybody realize that sonic sounds like the narrator from sub’s blox world
Shadow's Time after time has 6 Emeralds....So he can stop time... But.....Sonic's Three Dog Night ....¿where is his emerald?
0:35
This is sick
Loving these stand names.
When you realize the Sub’s world announcer is the voice of sonic
If this video could've Japanese audio, it would be good. Real, fantastic JOJO
Sonic The Hedgehog Faker VS Shadow The Hedgehog Faker
It isn't like the one I have. This one makes peace between all, light and dark, good and bad. Behold!  TAINTED LOVE!
Do
Shadow as dio Sonic as JoJo  If I'm right .
The blue one weirdly reminds me of someone who really pisses me off
me: *sees the title* oooo me: *seee animation* OoooOoOoo
guys, I'm like 99.99% sure this is a jojo reference
4:57 WTF is that jajajaja
I just noticed that 3 Dog Night looks like Robotnik.
Главный вопрос, почему не кабачки?
Sonics voice sounds like that one narrator from subs world
This is just Jojo Vs Dio but If Jojo had D’Arby’s ability
Funny part Shadow couldve easily kill Sonic had he not been so prideful to accept Sonic's challenge but then again not accepting wouldve been out of character
I just like this art style. I don't know why
The end was 🤬🤬
Wen I look at shadow I image ban from seven deadly sins
ShaDIO
Shadow a glizzy gobbler😂
Why does Sonic sound like the dude from Sub's channel
Shadow look so dark and egey and his coat with the napkin in front looks so 7 century
Imagine this in  Japanese
The fuck was this?
3:24 No, it YouTube
#GoShadow!
ono... *GIORNO THEME INSANE*
Y
Shadow wouldn't monologue. He is one of the least talkative sonic character.
Chillidog shadow 😂😂😂😂😂
i thought i was actually watching JOJO's for a bit
LMAO!!
Lol what in the world is this
shadow = dio sonic = jotaro
"Please sonic dont turn me into Chilli Dog"
LOL
The voice acting in this is absolutely legendary, especially Shadow they got it spot on!
Sonic sounds like subs blox world
Oh my god he ate shadow
sniper is jar man
Does that count as cannibalism?
thk im hungry now
Glizzy
Oh god now it's in my advertisements
Sonic is jojo and shadow is dio
Jojo
"ts spammer noob trash kid get good"
Ok did I just see a hedgehog eat a hedgehog
Instead of ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA, it’s OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM.
Shadow could've won if he stopped talking Shadow, you idiot
This is jojos bizzare advanture but in sonic version
Yay sonic wins
To quote helsing abridged: " the sonic fan base is weird."
JOJO Reference
This was the "ultimate" mash up.  Plenty of great references to both sources series.  My favorites have got to be that Sonic actually was hit by a magic arrow, "Time after Time" and"The World" of stopped time.
You stupids should make sonic star platinum and shadow the world
I hate sonic
Therapist: JoJo sonic can’t hurt you it isn’t real  JoJo Sonic:
Shadow should of just stopped time and ate every hot dog
Where do the names come from?
So it's the same type of stand as Three Dog Night.  Not much range, but immense power and precise movements.
Beautiful.
Also a Yu gi oh reference
When you relise having a stand in a sonic game was a jojo refrence
1:25 kars is that you?
Idk whether to call this an animation or something from deviantart
What did I just watch???
I love the colour blue and I love sonic and specially with hedgehogs to
7000,0000000000000000000000000000 LIKES ❤🥰😍😘
No me gustoooo
Qe asco so8 rspañol
sonics stand is not even a stand
"He's eating the world of stopped time!" LMAO
That's so cool. 😃👍
Still better than how Sega treats the franchise
Is it me or sonic sounds like Sub's World
That final bite was... *FATAL*
he just ate his booty at the end.
It was me, Sha-dio-w !!!
Imagine if Sonics grandfather comes out and says “ oh my god!!!!”
Isn’t him eating shadow cannibalism
Me and the fish guy was the picture on the fish we were the one who made this so thank you all for watching this
I love the part when shadow gets the Emerald Guy
Sonic the Glizzy Gladiator 😂
it should be chaos control
Yare Yare Daze
The Game Grumps need to watch this lol
Oh..my god...
Why shouldn’t do this is cause after it you will have the longest crap of your liffeee!!!
Hahahahah 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🍴
this is the funniest thing i ever saw
did anyone else see sonic eat shadow's glissy
The amount of references I understood in this one fucking video are insane.
Imagine if it was secretly a parody of a future part where Kars comes back instead of part 3 and that's why Shadow called himself "the ultimate lifeform"
❤🧡💛💚💙💜💖🖤❤🧡💛💚💙💜💖🖤👁👄👁
Go sonic
Missed opportunity to call time after time Chaos control
SoJo
Bruh jojo knockoff lolski
🖕🖕🖕🤛🤛🤛
Did anybody realise sonic stand looks like Dr.eggman
I love the detail on the sonic you did better then the people who made sonic the movie😂
No sonic version of Ora disappointed
all seconds for each time stop 1: 35 seconds 2: 53 seconds 3: 18 seconds 4: 14 seconds yes he can stop time for "5 seconds"
They're gonna be shitting for y e a r s after all that chili o m g
Jesus christ, I don't want to see his toilet afterwards.
Every sonic like chilli dogs
WHAT THE FRICK THE WORLD REQUIEM OH WHAT WHAT THE FRICK FAT PIG POOP BIG HOT DOH POOP POPP STUPID NOOB POOP IS FAT POOP
i just realised that since sonic ate shadow from the waist-down, yeah
Rr
Sonic the cannibal
wtf
Ok very good , but too buff
Since shadow said he was the ultimate life form maybe hey could’ve done a battle Tendency thing where shadow is Kars
DAAAAAA WAAAAA RUUUUUURRRRLLLL DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Shadow: I can stop time! Sonic: *nope*
Sonic will always win no matter what.😆😂🤣😁
Yay chilli dogs 🙁
Almost copyrighted
This is an Ad  😂
HOW DO YOU EDIT THESE?? LIKE HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE ANIMATIONS
Imagine a dragon ball super version XD
XD
Don't make me hungry.
how did i get in this fucking rabithole of shit looking for a viceo of a dio in s schoolgirl outfit breaking his back
Atlease Sonics ego went up
Sonic and shadow
Theres only one reason why you lost Ridiculous comparison Looking at the sky at the end Very fitting music  Yup, this is jojo.
Shadow: IM THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORM! Kars: *Hold my beer*
Them:fighting  Me:doing henry stickman distraction dance   Shadow:h-h-h-h-h-enry stick man    Lankybox:HENRY STICK MANNNNNNNNNNNN  shadow:NOOOOOOOOOO **turns in to henry stickman**    Time after time more like pie after PIE AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY    Parents:sonic's chewing is louder  then henry stickman MORE LIKE HENRY PICK MAN  it means that shadow is picking on teh chilli dogs get it?   Sonic:** eating the last chillier dog** Me:**eating the last date cake**
Awl I know is I wov chillie dwogs
Wtf did I just watch
What.....WTF am I watching?
He didnt notice that he acquired all the emeralds
For the Sub fans i think the narrator of Sub's world is sonic xD
Is it me or this is a jojo reference :]
WHY THE BLUE ARMS
When sonic and Shadow have been watching too much JoJo But is there really such a thing as “too much JoJo!”
Ah so Sonic on Netflix will look. lol
Is it just me or does the voice actor of sonic sound like a voice actor from Subs World roblox?
The buff of these characters are making me uncomfortable...
shadio
whys this an ad i always see
The funny thing is this video actually follows JoJo logic. I could actually see this happening in the anime 😂
👍🏻
I love sonic
So if it’s jojo part 3 then... shadow is Sonics great great grandfather?
i dont remember this scene from stardust crusaders
There are a lot of sonic references in this Jojo’s episode
Shadow stand is just gems
Can you pick my video
Seems legit
Since Jotaro’s stand is named “star platinum: the world” in part 4 after dios death,  would that makes sonic stand in his own part 4 after shadows death “three/3 dog knights/nights: time over time”?
Why does this animation make someone so cringy
S ew,,,,,.."lmjuytt
Sonic has the greatest power of all time, A stomach that can hold the whole world.
:/
This video is just basically an example of a Sonic fanfiction
My mom: Wtf are you watching Me:....I decided to check out all of Mashed vids
5:03 No this is actually false, he loss because he wouldn't shut the hell up. LOL
This could be worse if a certain group gets this
Another jojo villain who can stop time...       great.
Wait, Shouldn’t the chili dogs he’s eating stop inside this throat? Because of the time stop.
Basically Dio vs. Jotaro
Sonic sounds like an off brand Jaden Yuki
0:35
0:39
0:59
Sonic ball z
He has shadow dio now he has kars ulf?????
I liked the game grumps version
If shadow didn't talk when stop time he win and when sonic didn't speed up shadow win
That was the gayest thing I've ever seen
I mean sonic can already run faster than time stopping so makes sense
Can you pleeeeeeeease do another one of these I love the first one I will definitely love the second one
Cool this,is an ad
But Shedow love Sonis
Ya is good  I like Sonic
The area that shadow and sonic are at looks like shamar. Reply if you think so too and what sonic game is shamar from
Not gonna lie shadows stand is fucking dope
Pretty fucked up Sonic actually began to eat Shadow and not even in one big bite
😂😂😂😇😇😇😷😷😷😱😱😱🙋🙋🙋
It's basically sonic adventure 2 multiplayer games in a nutshell XD
is sonic voiced by the guy from sub's world???
They really made me feel bad for shadow
Shadow kinda reminds me of vegeta
Guys I know i might sound crazy but  I think this is a jojo refernce
?
2nd Time  Is That...    *A JOJO REFERENCE*
sonic: FUCKKKKKKK
ngl i felt bad for him loo
In an alternate timeline, Jotaro is looking for the Chaos Emeralds
Anyone else seeing this as an Ad?
is this jotaro vs dio?
I like shadows stand but it should have been called chaos or something like that
If they're this buff, imagine Knuckles...
HOTDOGS!
One Piece by far has the worst toxic fandom. With HxH and JoJo taking second and third for worst cancerous fanbases. Its just enlightening to look at fandoms full of people who have non-existent common decency or any sign of maturity. These fandoms just show the worst of humanity.
I would've enjoyed it if Shadow just said Chaos Control instead.
Meanwhile in the future:  "Silver, this is the last of my soul, take it from me!!!" "B L A A A A Z E!!!!!"
Sonic ate shadows pp    Let that sink in
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍🥰😍😍😍🥰😘🥰😍🥰😘🥰😍🥰😘🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🤘
Sonics stand is speeding evolution the more seconds past the more faster  sonic fights
Shadow laughs like dio
Meet my stand                                                       *[STAR CATINUM:THE WORLD]*
best jojo reference ever
Sonic eating the..... WHOLE WORLD
Sonics stand would be named live and learn. It would be able to control time. Either speeding up your movements or slowing them. Also sonic can change anything to be slow or fast except himself.
Bruh it would have been perfect if Sonic was Dio and he had [HIS WORLD] or at least at the end Sonic Should have said you're too slow.
I love how the white cloth on shadow's chest is basically his chest hair that's a nice touch
please stop showing me this ad, I hate JoJo
Lightning mcqueen would beat them with his kachow
The pure fucking fear you hear from Shadow is hilarious 😂😂
:D I like jotaro if he was in here
This is the best thing I've ever seen  Thanks for making this
Sonic vs shadow sonic wins and shadow truns  in a chill dog
Time  after time  (fast name the world ) 0:25
Gotta love when there's just casual food transformation and vore.
In some other univers, sonic has a stand with aloes him to move as fast as time.
First ad and first anime I’m clicking on and watching through till the end.
Shadow:epic
idk what was better, the animation or the voice actors
sonic sus
The only thing that would have made that better is if when sonic won he said "yare yare"
The fact that the chilli dogs were part the stand makes it even funnier because people like me wouldn’t be able to see it
YARE YARE DAZE
Jotoro vs dio sonic edition in a nutshell
The excuse for this short is araki ran out of ideas 😂😂😂
Shadow- "I can stop Time!" Objection!!! If you really could stop time, then nobody would be able to see anything in the video because there would be no light. In short, you're too slow.
I like this, the sonic characters have necks
It is...  Acceptable
This is like chilli dog summer
You have awaken my masters
Musel chaos emerald man!?
check the voice when shadow says sonic is eating!
this... why....what?
TIME AFTER TIME NANI!? SONIC HOW DID UR EAT WHEN THE TIME IS STOP CAUSE MY BIG BOX IS VERY HUNGRYYYYY AND ILL EAT U TO FOOL LIKE A CHILLIDOG!!!!!
I'm surprised shadow didn't just throw away all of the dogs while time was stopped.
Sex in a car. The first to add to your email. The. TELL me your email address nowwwwwww
Wait how is he the ultimate life form and having a stand did he get sent to space and got hit by the arrow? Probably
it just funny
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Why are they buff it just look poofy
Why does sonic sound like the guy from sub
This channel has gone downhill
0:25 Sonic's thoughts: Its the same type of stand of Three Dogs Night
Hi
I needed this
This is supposed to be a jojo reference but it feels more like a yugioh one.
Shadow hot dog I need it
Mmmmmm smexy shadow  Da buff MeatLoaf
Where's the chilli shadow
Is that how you get a stand in the anime
Jo Jo's bizarre adventure
Maximum cringe
Why does Shadow need A time spirit when he has Chaos Control?
There’s a limit to how much dumb I can take.  This hasn’t hit it yet.
This made me want chilly dogs really bad.
Sonic jojo vs shadow jojo
that sound like subs voice
Sonic just ate out shadow
What has my life come to where I'm watching Sonic Anime
Shadowlly dog
Sonics bizarre adventure: Golden Ring
I would looove sonics stand cause I love chilli I love hot dogs and I’d probably love chilli dogs too
IS ThAt A JoJo REfErEncE
Accurate, much like canon Shadow never shuts the hell up gloating.
Sonic Bizzare adventure is really good
This was an ad and I’m happy for it
Shadow : ( Turns into a chill dog )  Me : you poor shadow
Oh Shadow , like many others who failed,  you monologued too much
I read the title and then said "Haah, mukatte kuru no ka?" in a Sonic voice and now I can't stop giggling at myself oh god please help me
Shadows that should’ve been I am all of me at sonic should’ve been his world
Why am I watching this when I should be doing my work?
What is this beautiful construction of an animation
Why was there no dubstep fart when he stopped time?
.
The hot dog stand sounds like a close range stand.
Ham
what did i just find
Así que chiste pendejo
Does this mean sonic is a D'Arby? Remember the D'arby brothers turned people into poker chips and dolls by beating people in something like poker and video games.
Is that a JoJo reference?
I wish this would just stop getting into my ad feed
Get this out of my ads
Sonic:I don't know what you're talking about but all I know is that I love hotdogs  Classic sonic
Top 10 best anime quotes "you didn't like chilli dogs"
I'm sorry but all I hear is muda muda, aura aura and a dash of idiot sandwich
Epic
Za wardo
why did i think that was obama and sonic kissing on the thumbnail
00009’k
Imagine if Jotaro just ate DIO’s dead body after part 3
Sonic and his stand red hot chilli dog
So what happened to tails? Let me guess shadow turned him into a donut
SONLC GOOD
Chad energy
Kinda cool lmao
Fuck you sonic
Nice ad
Damn this got dark
How do you feel shadow   You time stopped like 3 times  Got a head start  And still lost   How do you feel
You thought it was I shadow but it was me dio
does that mean....  Sonic ate shadow? UwU
It's all that talking you did Jojo Shadow
"Time after time"                     Shadow the hedgehog
I cant BELIVE sonic won SHADOW IS THE REAL EDGELORD SO IF HES REAL OR NOT CRASH HIM WHENEVER YOU SEE HIM IN ROBLOX!!!
This.. Was advertised
ゴ ゴ *It's my enemy STAND* ゴゴ - Storm The Eagle 2020      And let's not forget that this is all coming from a British terrestrial channel that has been airing since 1982.
When youtube gives you good ads  THATS IMPOSSIBLE
Is that a jojo reference
Time after time I think Choas control would be more acceptable
I love the original anime this is based off of but this is cool as well
Now sonic is a canibal
Sonic eats shadow me thats cadiblism
I watched the whole JoJo anime just to get the context Yes, part 1-5. It took me a while but... HEY that's really nice! Now I know what the frick the arrow thing is now!
4:58 i really thought he was gonna say ''you really pissed me off'' not gonna lie
3 months
Wh..... Uhhh.... WHY IS THIS AN AD?
why why life is pain and misery
* giornos theme plays * fun
Sonic is Jotaro and Shadow is Dio
I have watched this like a month ago and I liked it
Sonic the cannibal
💩
What people who dont watch anime see : game sonic slowly eating chili dogs   what people who watch anime see: 3:36
Why are they so strong
This is so random
this is real good shadow lost and he trund in to a thiledog and sonic tock a beit shadows but hahahahahaha
Sonic got hit in the butt by the arrow HAHA
I expected shadow's stand to be named "chaos control"
Shadow's should've been live and learn
Rip I named my stand time after time
This is sonic boom on crack
This is the same music used in the Yugioh poker night video
This came out on my birthday!
Why Did Sonic And Shadow Become * SIXPACK? *
they have stands, I have sits.
Why.
I am not dissatisfied with this ad
Sonic ate shoddows chilli dog ass
💰💰💰.
r.i.p shadow coffin dance
He turned into a chilli dog, he's chilli dog shadow. Funniest shit I ever seen
*Hes sPEdInG Up! heS KeEpS SpeEDinG Up!*
Ummmm ok
Only one hedgehog will make it out alive, more like one hedgehog will make it out dead. Because sonic will be shitting shadow out of his ass,
So no one is gonna talk about the youtuber named Sub-Zero Sounding like Sonic?
I wanted him to start going HOTDOGHOTDOGHOTDOG just like how star platinum goes Ora whenever he barrages people with punches
Shadow with a cravat. I never knew I needed that.
Nice go Jo jo sonic me
Jojo
The voice acting is on point bro
this shit can't be unseen
This is so cursed, I love it
this videos is my favorite hentai now
Sonic JoJo said: You lost for one reason Shadow!  And the reason is very simple.  You talked too much.
And here I thought the real reason why Shadow lost was because he kept talking, not eating.
Fun fact Sonics faster than shadow! Also sonic highest speed is 1,000,000,000,000 mph also every time sonic runs he gets faster!!!
Shadow sounds like Dio in the dub.
Where is the song from? What's the name?
Shadow’s stand = the world Sonic’s stand = Chili Dog Plantinium
4:34
Shadow Is Cheating
Imagine if sonic lost and got turned into a chili dog. He would probably eat himself.
Someone Name How Many Times Shadow Said Stop Time / The World Of Stop Time/ Time After Time
Oh yes
Yet no chilli ended up on their gloves
Me: O_O Amy: 😍
Sonic sound actor is the narroter from sub's world
Or just shut up and just eat
VORED
Is this a Jojo reference
neat
Why though?
Can We call them Shadiow Brando and Jonic Joestar?
It be like Dio spamming Time stop
Shadow should have said Chaos control
It’s a glizzy stand
There's an animation tutorial for Krita I love to watch. I noticed you apply the same tip he did of setting the animation 2 frames back ahead of the voice lines. Neat, it really does look better. Also this is less of a parody and is more like a fan's genuine animation version of a side comic. It's not even insulting or making fun of either works. It perfectly captures both stories in what makes them so enjoyable.
<3
Sonic's voice is sounds like Sub :O
Jotaro: nani is that me on that lightball Dio Brando:nanii is not time after time is the World me Dio will defeat you animal me Jotaro: nani are they need to fight Dio Brando: nani is NOT TIME AFTER TIME IS  ZA WARUDO! Jotaro:welp they are not fighting Dio Brando: WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Jotaro: ok that is fast win for Jotaro Kujo Dio Brando: NANI WRYYYYYYYYYY ZA WARUDO ROAD ROLLER DAAAAAAAA Jotaro: yare yare daze
Why are sonic and shadow are in defrient bodys im only 7 and i watch this and i dontknow how to spell that much
Sonic The Hedgehog
glizzy king
I want one of those
Why is this Jojo themed
I feel like I've just found netherite on minecraft
Is the background Shamar from Sonic Unleashed or what?!
sonic eats shadow sausage bbs
cuantos chili dog come sonic 🌭🌭🌭🌭
"so its the same type of stand as 3 dog night"
They look like from dragon ball z
So much testosterone here
Nah fu this
And then he turned into polpo.
I’m sorry what
I love sonics voice
😳🗿
Did anyone realise that sonic has the same voice as that you that says a sub
Why does sonic sound like Sub Zero's voice
Had anybody realized sonic ate shadow he is now a cannibal
I want this in Japanese
Meanwhile, in an alternate universe, Sonic defeats Eggman by using his stand *[REACH FOR THE STARS]*
sonic sounds like sub
Which is real jojo? Mario or sonic
You forgot, KONO DIO DA! the most important thing.
This is the timeline where people didn't have 3d sonic and the terrible fanfics and oc's didn't exist.
“time after time”  i can finish this scentence  “time after time, you have failed”
Any1 else notice thats subs world narator is playing as sonic :/
How is sonic not fat
Man I love their voices
gg
Is this a reference to something?
Must of been a painful death for shadow
so shadow is dio and sonic is jotaro awesome
Sonic sounds like sub from sub's channel
This is absolutely terrible        And I am here for it
My two favorite things in one video
Not nearly enuff posses
Never challenge Sonic to a Chilli Dog eating contest you won't win.
They do not look like that
i  crying cus shadow died
Super dark sonic
Whata hell is this
I was driving in my car going down i-4 and there was an advertisement for boardwalk burgers, which is like this little shitty burger spot where like homeless people i guess just throw them on a grill or something and the sign said "come try the new boardwalk burgers" and i saw it out of the corner of my eyes and i was like boardwalk burgers, more like bored burgers, cuz the bored burgers aren't having any fun,
*you know when a character eats much , that character is the main protagonist.*
SAAAAWAAAAARUUUDOOOOOOOO PIIIIIIUUUUUN
5:07 Omg Sonadow
To be honest, Sonic is  right if you love food, (especially chili dogs) you can win food-eating contests.
😐
Did sonic just summoned eggman
I spent 4 minutes of my life to just witness sonic eat chilydogs.       (My face now).         ༼;´༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ༽
This was terrible
2:40 sounded like Pegasus from yugioh
I cringed when shadow didn’t say chaos control.
You will lose sonic 😠😠
mukbangers: *laughter*
STOP BABBLING AND EAT
SUBS BLOX WORLD SONIC
Why dose sonic sound like sub from subs block world
Why-
Shadow= Dio Sonic=Jotaro
😎😎😎😎😎😎😈
Was it just me or did sonic sound like sketch
Shadow should have named his stand Maria, or maybe a Shadow the Hedgehog song, lol.
IS THIS A JOJO REFEREANCE
Sonic's hunger for chili dogs 2:00 SONIC IS EATING, HE'S EATING IN THE WORLD OF STOP TIME!!! 4:06 Shadow the chili dog 🌶, the ultimate life chili dog 🌶: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo 4:56
Was really hoping for him to say Za waurdo
The thing is, is that the levels of cringe in this video is basically the Jojo dub cringe.
You know the sonic comic already did this but not as fucking retarded looking somehow
Good sonic
i like sonic
I actually wonder. How would chillidog shadow's inside look like
Man i steal have nightmares of the sonic fandom in the 2010s
sonic, but shadow is dio
This is the stupidest and funniest thing i have ever seen
It was funny to se Mario jojo, but seing sonic with that proportions I can only think about devianart fetiches
Sio soso
so when is knuckles vs meme knuckles
uuhhhh............mean while i thought there fighting,😑but they eating cuz of the muscle but later they gonna be dump fat frickin mouse xd🤣
Tenedfghhj .
Sonic sounds like the guy from bright side channle
Sonic should of got a stand called the blue chaos and shadow should get a stand called the shadow controller.  Like if you agree
[Time After Time] is unironically a great Stand name.
Kira’s theme plays
Lol eating hot dog
Never knew sonic was a canabole
Sonic and Shadow first date:
Shonic vs Sadow
yo sonic voice is bright side voice
😂HE FU*KIN AET SHADOW🤣
WWWWHHHHHHRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
SHADIO AND SONOTARO
Is that a JOJO reference
Gasp a JoJo reference
This is the most silliest video I've ever seen
i was rooting for shadow
😭😭😭😭😭😭
is this a jojo reference?
I’m going to tell my kids sonic was a canabul
I was watching this while i was eating i was the 1st person to finish  Coincidence?
Shadow's stand should be somthing with sonic rings around his wrists. Its name should be called super chaos
Ha hotdog stand
Time after time is just the world bass boosted
-_-
Eating that many chili dogs, nobody is a winner.
Goku naruto and luffy would like to know your location
yare yare daze
Your next line is... I'm the coolest
The fact that you named it after the band, Three Dog Night ensured to me... you sir...are a badass
Is it me or does sonic just sound I like the guy from subs channel
You have to be a true dog
That's no good
At the end it would be better if he said “your just too slow shadow” and then eats him like if you think it would be better
Who else thought they were going to have an epic battle to the death😆
Whats Wrong With Clothes xD
Where am I doh
Diooooooooooooooooo
IMAGINE THE SONIC'S STAND IN THE NEXT PART, IT WILL BE CALLED FREE DOGS NIGHT: TIME AFTER TIME?
ZA WARUDO
;-;
SONIC ATE SHADOW SO VORE 😂😂😂
Is that's a jojo reference??  Oh wait it is a jojo video reference
imagine how much gas they will have after this
c h i l i  d o g s
If mashed watched jojo bizarre adventure all of the episode's jotaros stand can stop  time as well so why did sonic get exactly the opposite of star platinum?????!?!?
5:08 Is sonic technically eating shadow’s pp
So technically he ate showads glizzy
Ist dio vs jotaro esenw
Im jojo fan
Sonic's stand is the chilidog guy from the unleashed comic.
ok but imagine if at the end where shadow is a chili dog he can still talk
Alternate title: sonic vores shadow after food fight
Sonic Won
Is that a jojo reference?
Not Sonic the Headgehog          Sonic the Chilli Dog
you know it says jojo, but i get the biggest yugioh vibes
Sonic wins most fight because he's that main  character and he's the good guy
CHAOS CONTROL
JoJo Sonic and the legend of the chaos chili dog
this was beautiful
the fact sonic can move though stoped time is canon in the archie comics
What did i just watch?
YOU DIDN’T LOVE CHILLYDOGS
Maybe he should stop talking the whole time and maybe he would have beaten Sonic... he talked litetally nonstop.
Sonic:shaaadow!!!!!
This is my favorite so far
Shadow dog
This is funny. Also how did sonics stand make 10,000 chili dogs appear
Is shadow supposed to be dio?
W.H.A.T.
When you realize Sonic just became a cannibal.
Haha Me Go BRRRRRRRRRRRRR https://youtu.be/e1tOrEewEwk?t=272
https://youtu.be/e1tOrEewEwk?t=187
Not ora ora ora and muda muda muda?
What if this was sonic boom
What is the name of the background music when Sonic reveals his Stand challenge?
Is that a jojo reference
This is awesome
Sayonara Chili the ShadowDog
JoJo Sonic part two: Robotnik tendency  Orbmu: awaken my creator! Cubcedice: awakens  Robotnars: awakens
Who plays sonic
i want to taste a shadow chili dog
Wow sonic now like a jojo  But its sonic bizart advancure
I absolutely love the sound design and audio mix here. It gave me Sonic-X feels
Jojo characters are jacked
that made no sense at all but I loved it
Dio: WRYYYYYYYYYY
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure: chilli sauce crusaders
0/10 for not making shadow's stand boulevard of broken dreams
Ah pendientes Sonic que Hierberia voz
not funny. didn't laugh
Dark...
>:(
Sonic won through sheer will and love of chili dogs making him one of the most powerful anime characters in existence  (Also he has NO PROBLEM eating another person if they lost
3:03 Woah 😳 Pause it right there
What in the 11-year old’s DeviantArt has assaulted my eyes this day.
Sonic sounds like sub’s narrator
Sonic's stand isn't a stand, it's a Hotdog man
It’s all fun and games till He breaks the world record
Sonic  sounds like sub
°                 °        °                              °  °          °  ß         Among us
Why are you make this video and why do you
ha ha HAAAAAAAAAA😹👍💪
Sonic Stand Idea:  [Stand Master]: Sonic The Hedgehog. [Stand Name]: Speedy Hill.  This name references Sonic’s Speed and Green Hill Zone.  Ability: [Speedy Zone] This allows the stand to speed up the user. After awhile, The user is able to moved in stopped time but it would take 5 minutes to gain that much power.  Stats:  Speed: S Power: B Aim: D Range: B Potential: C  Looks: It would have some form of a robot look to it with grass growing on it, the grass seen growing in green hill.  Requiem Idea:  Ability: [His World]  The user will gain so much speed he is able to give speed to other beings/objects around him.
Sonic is Daniel J.D'arby
This truly befit the title of Sonic's bizarre adventures
Why does this sound like a bad fanfiction
This is pretty much d’noul vs jotaro and dio vs jotaro mixed
"Sonic's Bizzare Adventure"
Shadow sonic its use cheathing
Hey sonic your hot dog is your joke
YOU’RE FAT!!!!!!!!! 🖕
Sonic should have also been able to stop time and then should of said: "Your not the only one who can stop time" then ate the chilly dogs and said nom like a barrage 😂😂
*V o r e?*
*[C'MON STEP IT UP]*
In the Archie Comics Sonic could move through stopped time. So this might actually be a reference to that moment.
İ want to see more of sonic jojo reference
Does this classify as vore
They actually watched jojo this time!
it slightly resembels a part of jojo
JoJo's bizzard adventures
Ugh they're not veryyy detailed enough
*The best crossover doesn't exi—*
“Yeah I watch jojo”
Oh god pls stop doing anime
I prefer part 1 Chaos Blood
This video is sponsored by TUMS!
Sonic Your games are awesome
At sonic do you why are you eating shadow
5:07 Shadow NOOOO <:"0
Master Emerald Requiem
++-
man but would you like some food from Arby’s?
So its the same type of stand as sta- 3 dog knight
guys call me crazy i think this might be a jojo reference
yare yare daze
That's just vore with a few extra steps
Best anime fight of the universe. This video has the most dramatic fighting I have ever seen
If this was real life 2 things 1st wouldn’t they get fat 2nd just why
Sonic reference
The muscles though
Is this a jojo reference.
hi
Shadow’s name should be ShaDIO.  but then, later, it should be Shadog.
ShadyVox is now my favorite voice for Sonic and Luigi on this channel.
I know why is moving when shadow stops the time that because he super fast  Sonic can break out of the time stop
S.E.F Estaría orgulloso de esto xd
I know who is the voice of sonic The narrator from sup blocks world
Ooo yay
no.
Shadow's Stand: spam ts
If DIO faced off against Boy II Man
Sonic the glizzy gobler 🤣🤣
Please make more Sonic videos
"IS THIS A MFING JOJO REFERENCE?!"
So Shadow Wants to be Dio and Sonic wants to be me?
Chili glizzy
This is the most hilarious videos ive seen
Sonic must be like I’m hungry imma ask people if they wanna be obliterated
Shdow 💏 leticia
Missed opportunity to use the Stand Name "His World"
Shadow is just fucking Edgeworth lol
His world sonic omg!!!!!!!!!!
I like it how sonic drizzils
at the end try aging watching last fight but put stardust crusades ost music it is so good. edit: and giornos theme.
The last chili dog was extra meaty, and way more juicy, down said more hairy
That was your skin sonic Oh dude that sells hotdogs like what is he going to do stuff shadow with hotdogs so that he gets so full and he looks like one of sonics videos more like one of the games OK I don’t really know what I’m talking about
Aww... Shadow should’ve named his stand Chaos Control. And he could’ve drop the Space Colony Ark on Sonic at the end lol.
Yare Yare.
Man, shadow is really using his stand alot. I guess... He keeps using it.. *time after time*
Couldn't shadow just stopped time with a chaos emerald?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SHADOW
The Stand Name Time After Time.. is not a bad name to be honest.
I wonder what the Japanese dub would be like
The way Sonic says : a mysteryous arrow    Is a bit weird
Sonic is hiper fast so he Cam move a time stoped
Dude just hit by a normal arrow
La mejor combinación del mundo mundiaaaaaaal!!!!!!!!!!
Tails stand: Hierophant tornado
I'm glad the Mashed is not afraid of people judging about the dramatic voice animations you go Boy/girl
I don't exactly like jojo, never watched it, but goddamn this is so well done. I love it 👌
Is that fuck sonic 💩RÉFÉRENCE !?
Shadow should've had the time stone tbh Good vid tho
Time after time is based on Zawarudo or the World
Yeah but why is the animation really good.
Omg i wanna eat that many chilidogs O    O    o
ITS SO CRINGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hgh, as if Shadow would ever lose to the likes of Sonic
This would of played out as shadow eating all the chili dogs in stopped time and not talking, shadow mostly likely would of also pulled and a gun and shot sonic as there is nothing stopping him as no rules were stated (yes I am a shadow fan boy)
I love this video
Sonic boom x2
shadow  is so handsome hedgehog
Was that a YuYu hakusho reference?
*archie sonic can move in stopped time-*
5:08 sonic eats shadows big sausage
This animation f****** sucks
Death by turning into a hot dog LOL
Death by obesity
What makes this funnier is this could ACTUALLY happen in JJBA
Emerald Splash Requiem.
Glizzy Adventure 2
jotaro vs dio but as a hedgehog chilli dog eating contest
I love the whooshing sound when they stuff their faces
Oooooooooooooh
This feels like a in salte....
*GLIZZY CONTEST*
The Sonic Fanbase is gonna have a trip with this one.
I honestly feel bad for shadow
*Sees Sonic and Shadow wearing pants.* *"Wait that's illegal."*
1:04 He has gloves in that scene but doesn't have gloves in any other scene
Que demoiooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooos
Shadow would’ve won that if he didn’t keep talking every 5 seconds
He could’ve one if you just ate the chili dogs and stopped talking
Sonic was fat
Does this make sonic a cannibal now?
No
Shadow will be the first Sonic is loser
100/100 best anime of all time
I'm already fed up za warudu
What would Knuckles stand be?
😂
Last part was pretty cursed tbh
I think the référence is jojo
The battle of chili glizzys
Uhm ooke
i didnt think sonic and shadow look like that as jojo characters
If shadow win he gana throw sonic on the trash
Why does this feel like it could actually happen in a Sonic game?
I love how sonic looks while buff he looks hilarious
This feels like a DeviantArt thing
Sonics stand should have been like made in heaven
🤣🤣 soo fani 🤣🤣
Why didn't shadow sonic say wryyyyyyyyy
this is definitely someones fetish
Shadow😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😲😢😢😢 rest in peace shadow🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌹🌹🌹
Actually I watched this allot so it's kind of cringe
How much money do i have to pay for 110 seasons of this!!
plz tell me background music 3:03
Za Warudo = Chaos controll
Its jist me or sonic in this video sounds like the narator in the Subs World Youtube channel
It just occurred to me that Time After Time has 4 eyes.
Was thinking he was gonna have a stand called miles per hour
Sonic is a glizzy-gobbler
Now that what I call vore
umm  sonic eat shadow you no that?!!
Jotaro Kujo has approved of this video.
If you look closely, in one frame you can see diavalo as a chilidog, so this is canon
He should have ate those words... or something.
i just watched this season of JoJo and... the fight was way more boring than i thought, this is more entertaining
Sonic Bizarre Adventures: Glizzy Crusaders
0:25 Me:*throws up*
Ahh yes my favourite part of jojo was 2 hedgehogs eating chilli dogs
Sonics voice sounds like sub from subs world
Did my mans sonic really eat chilly dog shadow? 😨
am i the only one who thinks shadows stand name should have been Chaos Control?
Hmmm SONIC SUcKS
how can someone so fit be able to eat so many chilly dogs without getting fat?
Lol
This is so funny to me 😂🙃🙃🙃🙃
Yasss
Are we going to ignore the fact that Sonic just murdered Shadow?
Oh god why
This is inaccurate his time stop should've lasted for 5 minutes, as in anime 5 seconds = 5 minutes.
This is a sus moment here
The first thing he ate of shadow was where his dick was suppose to be oh and his legs
This just made sonic 1000000000000000000x better
Lmfao this shit. I saw this after that scary as fk sydnry and the fat yellow rabbit thing. Good god was that horrifying. Then this where shadow gets eaten. Yall getting scary.
This must be the work of an enemy stand
Did any1 realise that sonic sounds like the guy in subs world?
Is that million of chilidog?? I think I'm gonna sick about this video😨😨😨
Me: “Mom can we have jojo??”  Mom: “We have jojo at home” Jojo at home:
godzilla
Sonic sounds like a *insert YouTuber name*
Sonic sounds like the guy in subs blox world
Lol
This looked like an actual anime
sonic vs shadow is so awesome
I actually think Time After Time looks way cooler than The World
bruh turned into a glizzy
I think the sound of sonic is sub
Sonic will always love chili dogs no matter what.
SONIC SONIC SONIC SONIC SONIC SONIC
0:56 Minis
Fact: shadow is STRONGER so he will fuck sonic idiot
SONIC U CANNIBAL
Epic
anyone think sonics voice sounds like sub's narrator
Sonic winning so faster
Sonic vs Goku in a Chilli Dogs Challenge!
See it’s funnier bc Kars is also is the “ultimate life form”
Meanwhile tails has a evil GER just watching like:Y'all weak y'all nothing wait until sonic has reached his peak of power and and kill him throwing the world in DESPAIR
Mas que desgraça é essa
wow...this is definitely not for children, there's straight up cannibalism :o
is that a jojo reference?
Sonic and Jojo bizar adventur lol
Understandable, have a great day
Sonic Sounds Like sub's world
쉐도우+디오=
They both the og glizzy gobblers
Sonic’s Bizarre Adventure Part 1: Phantom Ruby Part 2: Green Hill Tendency Part 3: Eggdust Crusaders Part 4: Master Emerald Is Unbreakable Part 5: Golden Ring Part 6: Stone Labyrinth Part 7: Spring Yard Run Part 8: SuperSoniclion
This isn't how Jojo fights go! You're supposed to keep your stand hidden, or you hide yourself, while using the stand's power to fight. Still funny though.
How!
Rip sonic
Ficol Orrivel
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😋😋😋
did Sonic jo jo move
shadow you loose
Hope shadow wins
JoJo but is sonic version   sonice gets shot in the ass   and shadows getting head  how are they not ded
jotaro vs dio
sonic vs shadow
Shadow:However my limit of stopping time is 5 seconds *proceeds to keep talking for 20 seconds*
Shadow only lost because he kept talking instead of eating. That's your lesson for today kids, don't talk while eating.
glizzy gladiator😳😳
wien
mek it wen shadow'
One time me and my cousin were play fighting and out of nowhere I started saying “ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA” and he said “then come as close as you like” and I was surprised cus he never heard of jojo
In your dreams
Pfffftttttt Yeah right
Oraoraoraoraoraoraoraora oraoraoraoraoraoraoraora oraoraoraoraoraoraoraora oraoraoraoraoraoraoraora oraoraoraoraoraoraoraora oraoraoraoraoraoraoraora
I'm hungry now.  *give me sonic's stand right now*
Shadow spent a lot of time just monologuing too
I legit thought sonic would have a badass stand but this stand that can make food is actually good
Shadow would have won if he kepted eating. Anime logic villains talk to much lol
Sonic!!! Sonic!!! Sonic!!! Sonic!!! Ho no ho wow good job sonic =-)
Great! Now i want chilidogs! And they're for some reason impossible to get in my country... but this is just so damn hilarious! XD
vore
wwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
The only reason sonic could win was because of his rule 34 powers.
Fun fact Archies sonic can move in stopped time
Shadow brando and sonic hamon
And so Sonic took Time After Time’s power for himself…and Shadow was digested. Good night everybody!
Sonic is so disgusting he was EATING SHADOW!!!!!
When you realize than being an ultimate life form is a JoJo reference
Sonic has been the glizzy gobler this entire time
Moral of the story, Don't cheat in any games..... ever.
Nobody : something fishy here .. .. ... .. Totally nobody : I smell fire force here
...Sonic eating Shadow. Well that's quite a few deviantart artists and fanfiction writters finaly validated.
5:09 Vore
Behold sonic the real glizzy king
THIS WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR SHADOW TO SAY “CHAOS CONTROL!!!”
I guess you could say sonic has   a hot dog stand
Did sonic just eat Shadows ace?
Sonic The Cannibal
He just ate shadows wiener.
Isn’t the dude voicing sonic the dude that is in sub’s world
Is this a jojo reference
This a furries wet dream
When you realize sonic can move in stopped time canonically.
9araf 0
Archie sonic is faster than time heh
Cool animation in JoJo style
Sonic!
Turned into a chili dog? Shouldn’t it be turned into a donut?
Aku suka
The JoJo, s references came to highlight the games
Lol: fat shadow  Lol: fat sonic  Sonic: .  Me: WELL DO SOMETHING  Shadow: .
It’s in not japenese!!!
This is jojo all over again
😍😍😍
Imagine the calories
Vore
🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸
Man you blew it! You could have said “there is one reason why you lost shadow, ‘youre too slow’”
😻👍🏻👩🏼👧🏻👨‍👩‍👦‍👦🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦄🐇
Am I the only one that noticed the voice for sonic is the sub's world narrator
what the fuch is that is not sonic and shadow
Sonic became a canible
.
Muda muda muda muda muda
Wait if sonic ate shadow, isn’t that gei?
*Seeing how gay the gem dude looked*   So dis a *Jojo Bizarre Adventure* reference?
Sonic is a god
Buena parodia 👍👍👍 Sonic es mi personaje favorito  Pero.... Porque tiene subtitulos en ingles si ya esta en ingles? Lo que necesita una animacion asi de buena y con urgencias es subtitulos en español
Shadow is very cool and sonic
Jojo Furry Edition
I thought they were friends but how are they ticck ?
The ending can be considered as vore   Enjoy that thought
Sonic eating Shadow is horrifying.
L
How can you do so long animations in so much little time? i mean pocket monsters was released after rick's battle and this jojo
DID HE REALY EAT SHADOW
Sonic sounds like subsworld
Best anime show EVER
Why eww sonic human
Wtf
Delete this cringe
Can we talk about how shadow can already stop time with chaos controll
Lol next time i want real and epic battle :3
IM MAKEING(.    ) MAK AND CHEESE 	AND NO ONE CAN STOP ME
A chili dog 🐶 you mean like a child
what
in my PERSONAL opinion, I feel kinda disappointed because they had a lot of potential in this concept like knuckles and sonic fighting In a way similar to beruccicati vs giorno but this is my PERSONAL opinion meaning it is correct and that any other opinions are wrong.
JoJo
Why sonic is big amd buff and funny nad cool
ZE WARUDOOO
Behold ZA WARU... sry wrong anime both are great th
I'm getting chazz vibs from shadow
im the only one to feels bad for shadow?
Well that was hilarious and I like how Shadow is wearing a cravat that suits his style.
Kill me
Im dont like shadow
Is sonic sub
I really thought Jonic Joestar was gonna hit Jodow Jorando with the "You were just too slow."
"Burb"
In some alternate universe, Sonic can stop time with his stand *[HIS WORLD]*
sonic
Well I guess Sonic is a cannibal now
do anybody want a chili dog
Funny chili dog right now
Sonic aaaaaaaaaaah
In the beginning, WTF IS THIS
Shadows stand should of been named Chaos Control.
HOLD IT SONICS VOICE IS ON SUBS CHANNEL
Sonic sounds familiar...
i fill like sonic should have been dragon ball but this works too
Sonic the glizzy gobbler
🙏🏻❤️
omg
cool
I like how he litteraly repeats the fact that he can stop time
5:07 isn’t this technically cannibalism
the world revolving
Why can't we make shadow the good guys JUST ONCE PLEASE PLEASE😭😭😭

JOTARO! DIO!
Sonics always been a jojo reference
Ok but WHY THE HELL ARE SONICS ARMS BLUE
I like how sonic ate all of that chilli dogs but it looks like he didnt got even a bit fatty
After that video i want to eat a  chilli dog lol
they turned him into a chilidog. 2nd funniest shit i've seen.
I like Shadows voice when he's a chili dog he gets eaten by sonic
What sonic doing
at 1:20
I like how it's a jojo meme with no オラオラ
nobody: Jotaro to shadow: so its the same type of stand as star platinum
Glizzy gobblers
Nice
This is ridiculous
i hate this why you make shadow like that how dare you make another video in which shadow will win :|
4:40 shadows defeated face looks soo sad and i feel bad rn xd
That must been Archie Sonic.
Ko   no   DIO  da!
Hedgehogs don't have muscles-3-                                    But shadow is a bit hot >;)                                And that's coming from a gay girl-_-              This is how many people who think that's weird 👇
Just sonic eat shadow
This was a pit cheezy
Sonic e Shadow:............ Lindsey(me):....guys you ok?,Shadow? Shadow:.....ho my got....

Sonicccccc
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Poor shadow
omgoodness he ate him
Jk
Noah
Sonics stand name could have been crush40
LMAO
Hey Sonic, you know that's cannibalism.  A hedgehog eating a hedgehog.
Imagine biting your tongue during this
Sonic X: The Glizzy Saga
Talk about glizzy goblers
Shadow is in Sonic's Tummy
5:05 Was that considered cannibalism
This video motivated me to watch jojo
Maybe I am crazy but      Is     THIS JOJO REFERENCE!?!!!?!?!?!?!
2:19 was that a, Gripping Food With Force reference?? XD
How the ass-fucking shit is "The Dog Will Never End" for kids I'm sorry I couldn't vent there so I'm doing it here Good work everyone
WTF?
Sonic Booom Zeee
3:31 Archie Sonic in a nutshell.
This has become one of my favorite vids 😂
This is amazing
Where's the sub?
You have jjba down pat. Especially those oddbal stands that need specific situations to work.(Like the D'arby brothers who need yes or know questions to read minds or consent to steal souls in a game) I'd suggest the next super anime bros episode be something like this if(you haven't already did something like that in the first one) I didn't have my fingers crossed of the cliche romance anime but Daisy is yandere for Luigi or something
Pls make more of this
You just watched hedgehogs eat chilli-dogs for 3 minutes
5:04 I thought he was about to say *”You’re too slow”*
Therapist:  sonic jojo dont existed he can't hurt you  sonic jojo:
Who was the voice of Sonic?
I love this JoJo reference in Sonic
No shadow hubieras ganado has ganado yo te aplaudo a ti👏👏🤗
Te amo shadow soy tu fan numero 1 te adoro  😄😄😊😊🤗❤❤♥♥😍😍
What is gonna happen on shadow version? 🤔
We don't talk about rouge in this universe
Why is sonics stand so fat :T
*I REJECT MY MAMMALITY, SONIC!*
You what's great about Sonic's Stand?, Infinite food supply.
Can I just....appreciate how nice Shadow looks?         *Please? Let me appreciate his hawtness in peace sndbmxnfk*
He really missed the chance to say "You're too slow" when he was about to eat Shadow
Guess you could say that Shadow was a weenie.
Vectors stand: the computer room,  Nuff said
Your next line will be  That is a JoJo reference
Mas que p**** é esse ?!
PLEASE MAKE MOREEEE
Sonic sounds like the voice from subs Chanel
uhu sonic won !!!
Sonic before getting his stand Sonic: What? This guy is my stand so lame. Stand: I can cook Chili Dog Sonic: NVM
Blake swift is the subs Blox world narrator 0:37 the start of Blake Swift's lines
Okay. Mashed is god damn brilliant.
NUKES
4:07 holy shit this is hilarious
Sonic y Shadow están mamadisimos !!
4:07
Am I the only that is hungry after watching this?
So, is there like an inside joke of Sonadow Vore or something for this?
Oh my god, the voice actors are so on point I have shivers
Some will say blessed and some will say cursed. I say this is God-Tier
Wow
Dude he ate shadow
So what your saying is.....      SONIC IS A CANNIBAL!?
Why didn’t shadow say “chaos control.” (Sad noises)
The fan base is... Diverses.
Does shadow really think he can beat sonic after the chilli dog contest?
Is JoJo's reference?
The glizzy gobblers 😳
Notice how he ate shadow at the End of him😏😏🏳️‍🌈
I hate the end so much
Sonic the glizzy gladiator
I see that muscles sonics in other places,Like...Hell...
Somic eat jalidogs go sonic

Sonic: There’s three reasons why you lost shadow, just three simple answers. 1. YOUR too slow 2. You keep talking while I kept eating 3. You didn’t love chili dogs
Jotaro dies in part 6

Why does sonic sound like Subs (yes there’s a youtuber named Sub) narrator
*Jojonic The Hedgehog: Phantom Shadow*
Why thus sonic's voice sound so familiar
"I DONT WANNA BECOME A CHILIDOG!" Shadow. T. Hedgegod - 2020

Shadow should enter a glizzy competition
I like the voice actors and I like the art and I mite be jeffy from sml or sonic the hedgehog
Can't believe you got away with animating a Sonic fanfiction where he eats Shadow.

Wow I love
Am I in the right anime is this Jojo?
I can't believe I forgot jow bizarre jojo is
So, Darby
Sonic's Super adventure: Freedom Crusaders

Shadow is my favorite character
It’s kind of disturbing that he ate shadow at the emd

Shadow stand should be called [The Damn Fourth Chaos Emerald]
Tails' Stand: My Life is Like a Whirlwind: Similar to the stand, Aerosmith, except more combat oriented. It resembles a living airplane, and Tails can ride the stand, and it has abilities like creating tornadoes, homing missiles, and can transform into a mech-like form.  Knuckles' Stand: Five Finger Death Punch: Has the ability to literally punch a person into next week. Like when the Stand's fists make contact with a person, they get sent 1 week into the past or future, depending on the user's choice. Can be negated by other Time-affected Stands though.   Amy's Stand: Hammertime: Radar-type Locator that allows Amy to locate one target she personally knows, as long as she concentrates. Also has massive earthquake hammers for arms.
nice jojo reference
Shadow sounds just like dio
Look at all them glizzys🤠
Shadio vs Sonataro
I WANT TO SEE FAT SHADOW and maybe sonic...

This is why I'm subscribed to this channel.
How were they not fat especially sonic
This is creepy and funny I'm 9 I'm going to have nightmares for weeks.😣😣😣
This is super funny
Ho.
Yo...    Sonic has been a Glizzy gobbler from day one 😔 smh
And in the future, AMy teams up with Cream and Big the Cat to chase down a serial killer who only wants a quiet life, Geoffrey St. John
This Video Is A Disgrace to Jojo
Yes  you  can 😏😏
Is this Fucking Persona reference?

He ate shadow to funny 😆
You know shadow, you can't mock Sonic's stand when your own stand looks ridiculous

Joonic's Bizarre Adventure Phantom Hedgehog Emerald Tensidty Chaos Crusaders Speed is Unbreakable Golden Emeralds
Sonic’s bizarre adventure
I never watched Jo Jo before, so this is weird.
Add a s for UK rtf
Honestly why didn’t shadow just call his stand chaos control
Missed opportunity because Silver the hedgehog actually shares the jotaro voice
This is someone's fetish.
SoNiC HaS bLuE aRmS sO yOu DiD iT wRoNg!!!
Did you notice that sonics voice is similar to sub's voice weird
Sonic X jojo:Jotaro sonijo
"With my Stands POWWA I can stop time!" ... Couldn't you do that already before?
I was hoping their stands would be named after Crush 40 songs.
Jotaro
Make sonic jojo 2!
*this is basically Vore but with extra steps*
I think it would've been funnier if Sonic's Stand was Tails
Hoh hoh mukatta kuruno ka?
When will we get a none dio and jotaro fight reference
JOJONIC THE HEDGEHOG: GLIZZY IS UNBREAKABLE
I didn’t think that this was where it was going
That's at least three less layers of plans and counterplans than regular basic JoJo part 3
I need more of this
I believe Jotaro’s English voice actor would be a good fit for Shadow. A lot better than the current voice actor
This video is really weard
does this count as vore?
Wait- Sonic just ate Shadow- 😏😏😏
Is he speeding up!?😂😂😂😭
Tails:hey sonic i got hit by a mysterious arrow.
When shadow turned into chilly dog that was a joke to me lol
Why does Sonic sounds so familiar....  *checks the description*  Holy crap it's Shadyvox, it's been forever since I've heard him.
They suck gizzy
Ayoo
Shadow being a chilli dog and getting eaten is weird lol
stando powa
Sonic is faster then light
No
This isn't similar to jojo at all! When time stops for 5 seconds, it should actually be 1-2 minutes at least.
At the end sonic ate shadow and that was disturbing
Hold on..is sub voicing sonic?
Ok the name is NOT RIGHT LOL
sonic vores shadow. *yep, this is a sonic fan work...*
The amount of nonsense absurd monologues was too accurate lmao
Bro he called it time after time...like the song, well it's chorus at least😁
I was gonna say, three dog night which is a hotdog vender and no matter the era hotdog venders stay the same.
Sonic johnathan and shadow as dio
SONIC IS SO FAST!!!!11!1!11
This is so fucking stupid but I can’t stop watching it
Baby very like see sonic
That ending is....disturbing
Cool
I imagine tails having a stand that makes everything spin and fly, similar to tusk
Chaos shadow 5 second
Hot dog 😎😎😎
Three dog night requirem
*every time sonic he gets cold*       Sonics speed: *i n f*.        Vegate: HIS SPEED IS OVER NINE THOUSAANNDD
NOO NOOOOO I DONT WANNA BE A CHILLY DOG
WTF     🧐
The cannibalism at the end 👀
Surprised the name wasnt chaos control though time after time is a pretty great name
Is it just me or does sonic sound like the subzeroextabyte narrator?
I mean [Three Dog Night] ability totally sounds like a canon stand ability
First time sonic boom bandages are cool
I was expecting sonic songs as references but thats what I get for trying to guess mashed
Sonic=mega shit
Sonic got the power of the glizzies
This is cursed
Sonic's stan is both broken and stupid😂😂
In 4:06 I started feeling sorry for shadow especially when he said he doesnt want to become a chilli dog
Why does Shadow look like Miles Edgeworth?
Cannibalism
you see i thought shadow stands was gonna be chaos control
my favorite type of hentai
I feel bad for their stomachs
Sonic ate shadow’s A$$
Bruh :0 shadow-dog
Is this a JoJo's reference?!
This was actually...not terrible. Props.
I hope he got Pucci's stand "Made In Heaven : Time Accelerated" !!!
Kono shadow da!
haha shadow glizzy
Glizzy gobblers
Shadow: Dio Sonic: Jojo
is this a jojo reference or im just hallucinating
JoJo joke🤡
О наркота подъехала
Glizzy man
Sonic sounds like the guy from sub blox world
I still don't know if I like these insanely jacked hedgehogs.
Lol cream reacted to this https://youtu.be/iYsxexp7xL8
I wonder if Amy, Sticks, Blaze, or Rouge have their own Stand Powers?
Sonic ate shadow, that means sonic has THE EMO
Every time Shadow said “time after time”, I couldn’t help but think of that song “time after time”
I’m so glad you guys kept it clean
The voices are perfect!!!!
Visual confusion
Im the only one that think the scenary is one of the levels in Sonic Unleashed? Where Pinkle professor have his second "laboratory"
Stand Name: Time After Time Stand User: Shadow the Hedgehog  Power: B Speed: A Range: C Durability: B Potential: E Precision: B  Stand Name: Three Dog Night Stand User: Sonic the Hedgehog  Power: D Speed: D Range: A Durability: B Precision: A Potential: A
Sonic's stand was kinda dumb They should of made it ring related or something. Also shadow could have won if he didn't panic or stoped eating everytime he stoped time
Oh it's Dio vs jotaro
This was soo cool ,thx
bb
This animation looks like something i would see in 2014
9/10 -IGN "Not enough Chilli-dogs"
Make more kid friendly ones like this
This has much better mouth animation than the actual anime. Kudos.
Is this a JoJo refference?
Immortality! Eternal life! And STAND POWER! This proves that no one can surpass SHADOW ! Puny Humans! I shall rule you all! Bow before my knowledge and might!
When you realize Sonics voice actor is actually the narrator from subs world
Seriously why aint you bringing out the next Grant battle
All he can do is stop time.he thinks hes da best when hes not.
this is weeb trash
Next is Sonic vs Eggman      But in a Jojo style.
I’m not saying my dad is going to be there tomorrow morning and I’ll call y’all when y’all get back I love y’all and I miss y’all bye bye 👋🏿 is your day and I have
What if the Darby brothers fought DIO
this fails as a jojo parody
No se inglés
Oh god it ended with a Sonic tier fetish too  *Vore*
Sonic sound like Sub's world
SHADOW VS SONIC (JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE X SONIC THE HEDGEHOG PARODY)
I realised how shadow is basically dio cos time after time is basically the world but he would make a good jotaro as well cos they're both edge lords  ZAWARUDO!!!!!
SHadow : how you move in time stop Sonic : i stopped time for 15 seconds in movie
And thats why you don't eat and talk at the same times
Do more jojo reference
Shadow ? What fucking you doing ?   Shadow : i'm not shadow. Now... CONNO DIO DAAAA !!!!! URIIIIIIIIIIIII !!!
Is this a JoJo reference
Holy moley. Sonic just hogged down Shawdow’s Chili Dog!
im cringing so god damn bad my brain is a puddle how did you come up with this cocaine?
*what*
Sanics Bizarre Adventure 2: Emerald is not Crash Battle
This is proof that sonic goes fast by eating chili dogs
it all started because of the mysterious arrow
Is this video a Sonic Reference?
why does sonic sounds like sub zero minecraft narrator?
Stand user: Sonic Stand name: Blue blur  Stand stats: C in power A in speed B in potential D in range D in durability
This is comedy
What is sonic and shadows special moves u should make them fight that would be tuff
Pls make another JoJo like video
So is sonic a cannibal?
Chilli dog eating contest stop im dead XDD
Holy God what happened to sonic and shadow its more cringey
Me: 👌 MMMM YEAH fuck yeah
_Why does Shadow have Miles Edgeworth's clothes?_
Glizzy
This makes me extremely uncomfortable
Welp, that's some vore right there.  Good animation, nice work.
4:33 THAT WAS SUPER SONIC OR ULTRA SONIC
U
Oo the last episode of Sonic Weird Journey: Emerald Crusaders
I was expecting a fight
+
The end cannibalism?
Here I thought Sonic's stand was gonna be Live And Learn
Ha shadow got voered
I love this video so much that I want a Sonic JoJo Sonic versus Tails where Sonic eats tails
Sonic ate Shadows Hot Dog :O
To finish chilli dogs contest you gotta love them first.. :)
And try making this video in anime fight in 16bit sonic vs boomed sonic like in the Olympics games
Next time try making this video in 180701000 in quality
Sonic AND I love chillydogs and hotdogs
The moment his fear of becoming a chili-dog kicks in is just perfect. x'D
Haha, cannibalism. :D    Now I want a chilly dog.
Why why why why ..... (￣^￣)
Missed opportunity for Shadow's stand to be named "Chaos Control"
Now I want some chili dogs.
But dosnt his stand get stronger if anything id do a fireforce parody
5:08 is this some sort of vore
I was expecting sonics stand to be more like star platnium
So, in the end, Sonic puts Shadow's sausage in his mouth. That a fanfic author's wet dream.
Sonic bombadão fodase kkkkkk
Sonic as Jotaro Shadow as DIO
Who is sonic Sonic is uhm idk
Why does sonic dound like Sub
paphetic but funny
How did sonic stay so fit?
Hmm I wonder what kirby stand would be
So I’m guessing shadow the chili dog becomes shitow the poop later.
Eventually, shadow stopped thinking.
Lol
why am i just now finding this in my recommended?
Original Stand do not steal
He killed my favorite character Luigi the green one
Heat the purple one is mean
How come you like Luigi so much you killed my favorite character is Luigi
I feel bad when Shadow turn into a chili dog
I wish he finished his sentence with a:  "There's only one reason why you lost, Shadow." "There's juste one simple answer."    "You're too slow."
that was so good and creative
So  Does this count as Sonic Vore?
maybe shadow less talking and more chowing
Shadio
marketed plushie, chili dog, same thing
Oh what? Uh ok that is awkward... but cool
😳 Well...that was NOT where I expected this to go AT ALL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What.
......
Wasn’t the chilli dog made from shadow so isn’t that cannibalism holy shit Sonya you’re a cannibal#SonicsACannibal
So....    Does this mean Sonic is a cannibal?
Sonic's stand is a mixture of superfly and boy 2 men.
No they got hit by a shiny ring B)
Oh god this this has weeaboos written all over it I’m outta here. 😂😂🤣
Can you make sonic and shadow fights in jojo style but with real fighting?🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sonic’s bizarre adventure
The hotdogs men from sonic unlehsed xddd
That was the weirdest fight in my life that i have ever seen
The loser is noob
He turned himself into a chilidog funniest shit i ever seen
Sonic: so shadow we got a challenge ready? Shadow: RAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
youtube why is this in my reco-, wait this is in my sub- MASHED WHAT IS THIS
My insides are M E N T A L Y DEPRESSED
Sonic The Hedgehog: Glizzy Gladiators
There glizzys
Glizzy Devourer
Expectation: sonic anime  Reality: sonic the hedgehog cartoon.
Not how I remember sonic adventures 2
MEANWHILE, in an alternate universe- "I'm telling ya tails, he turned into a pickle. He calls himself pickle shadow. Funniest shit I’ve ever seen"
This is ridiculous   But I love it
Not the time dog man ANYONE BUT THE TIME DOG MAN FROM SONIC UNLEASHED
I Guess this also counts as vore?
Shadow: *You dare approach me?!*  Sonic: Can't eat you if I don't get closer.  Shadow: *Then come as close as you wish!*
Glizzy contest
so shadow did not get any new powers....
So it’s basically a Hotdog Stand....  Wait...I see what you did there
The Sonic voice actor works at Subs Blox Wold
5:01 and then he gets turned into a chili dog. Funniest shit I ever seen
Shadow: Oh, you're approaching me?  Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?  Sonic: I can't make you eat those words without getting closer!
It was kinda sad when shadow said I don’t wanna be a chili dog :{
Legends say sonic is still eating chili dogs
Damn I thought sonic was gonna say “ there’s only one answer why you lost shadow you’re too slow”
I thought shadow would have been like kars cause they are both the ultimate life form
was that a jojo referance?
sonics bizarre chilli dog contest
Sonic sounds like the guy from subs world you know the YouTube channel that's about mincraft the one that was the first narrator
glizzy stand
Missed opportunity to make shadow Kars aka the ultimate life form or dr egg man shadow and anyone else as the pillar men
More jojo!!!
cool
And then he turned into a chilly dog   *funniest shit I’ve ever seen*
Sonic’s emerald adventure
Shadow’s stand should have been Maria
I hate jojo
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
chilli dog rush
C h I l I to the D O G
Wtf
NOOOO DON'T TURN ME INTO A CHILLY DOG  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA     other version: NOOOO I DON'T WANT TO BE A CHILLY DOG actually being a chilly dog is fin- *sonic starts eating him* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
How long was i waiting?
Sonic the Glizzy Gladiator the Hedgehog
Oh man, I thought Sonic's stand was gonna be "Tropical Hot Dog Night"
going by the sonic movie, sonic posseses the ability to move infinitly fas., and since moving a distance in 0 time is the definition of infinite speed, time after time would not have any effect on sonic. (sources see stone ocean)
Omg
Wait wait wait he just ate is penis... Right?
GG
The voice of sonic sounds like sub zero
I appreciate the fact that this is all just one big jojos reference
Sonic’s stand can theoretically backfire but doesn’t because of how fast he eats  H knows the rules yet doesn’t care cause of how powerful he really is
Spaceman: Wait?! Its All a Jojo Referenz? Spaceman with gun: Always has been...
oh dear lord Sonic's a monster.... He didn't even start eating shadow by the head. He made him suffer
What the fuck did I just witness XD I never would have thought of this as a crossover and yet it strangely works. Oh my god though! I have no words XD
Sonic: *ive also got shot by a mysterious arrow* Hidden message: *in the butt*
Shadow has never looked sexier ..lol😂
Ending: Sonic eating Shadow Artists of DeviantArt and Rule34: *I am four parallel universes ahead of you*
Shadow : ho! Your approaching me!
Nice animation u know.
No
Y asi fue como sonic consiguió comerse la salchicha de shadow
Rule 34 here we go
Why does this feel like a episode of dbz
I never thought these two series would work, but looks like i was proven wrong
Kkkkkkkkk
Sounds more like Yu-Gi-Oh than Jojo 🤣
hello mashed your taking espanish
Should’ve made shadow say chaos control, huge miss opportunity
_Even _*_chaos control_*_ is a Jojo reference._
Why does sonic look like boom sonic
Is the voice of sonic is youtube name called Sub's Worlds?
This got a little yugi oh vibe  too for some reason
WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"i shadow, the ultimate life form-  Me: no no, that kars's job.
Moral of emeralds: if you have a stand that has to do with emeralds you’ll get donut
Dang shadow and sonic must’ve been listening to knuckles
I always wanted to see something like this never thought it would happen  but I’m so happy it is a thing
Is that a JoJo reference
you mad lads. the fandom power is out of control
Chilly dogs!
Sonic: “Sure do love chilidogs”  Shadow: “NO I DON’T WANNA BE A MARKETABLE CHILIDOG AAAAAAAAAA”
Remember kids, don't talk with your mouth full.
Sonic:There is only answer why you lose shadow there one simple answer Because you u never shut up
Is time after time a chet baker reference
Е*ать,  ну и х*йня🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣 shadow is gone for ever 😅😬i tink That shadow taste not so yumy 🌭😅🤣
thanks for the inadvertent furry vore
is that cannibalism
What I saw in this video: a buff shadow and a buff sonic defining the rules of the sonic games........ A male never wears clothes
Sonic eats Shadow...         Rule34: WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!
The voices ! Waouw ! It's impressive ! I love it ! The animation is Awesome ! I Imagine Golden wind in sonic xD SONIC NA NA NA NA NA NA NA   The guys, carry on !:D
I think this is a jojo reference
Shadow's stand looks a bit weird to be honest
One word nomnomnom
Yep
Hope that black chilly dog isn’t lava crust-
At the end Shadow looked like a burnt chili dog. I wouldn't eat that.
*nOSe*
This the best video ever.
This is so anime and I love it
I thought that Sonic's Stand will be Running in the 90's. Also did Sonic technically vored Shadow at the end XD
SERIES PLEEEEEASE
Is that a jojo reference?
The sonic jo jo sound like sub the roblox youtuber
Sonics voice sounds like subs worlds narator
This is a weird glizzy challenge
I like shadow and sonic voice :D
1:02 this sounds EXACTLY LIKE SHADOW OMG. I love everyone's designs, maybe sonic least of all but he's also pretty good. Shadow is clearly the star here tho
I hate how sonic's stand could be a legitimate thing in Jojolion
Lol  🤣🤣🤣 Sonic and shadow:  Nom Nom Nom Nom *eats sound. eat challange.Lmao
FATALITY
Lol
F for shadow
It makes sense sonic can still eat when chaos control/ time after time sonic Id the speed of sound
Beautiful
Be dope if he said chaos control
sonic the hedgehog is my favorite video game character and I have never watched Joni before tho. I assume it’s pretty cool based on how all my friends say it is
To be continued
So if shadow lost by one hot dog then if he actually learned how to shut the fuck up he would have won
'Jonic vs Shadio'
Wtf? 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Moral of the story: you don’t need to be edgy to be a badass.
Welp, sonic just ate shadows sausage
I thought Kars was the Ultimate Lifeform
Time after....time
I like the detail of the cockring necklace lmfao
Shadow did not win because of his lack of love for chilly dog, but because he couldn't shut up and eat, but no he had to narrate everything while time was stop
The ultimate glizzy gobbler
And shadow didn't just fight and kill sonic because...?
sonic ate shadow ass yummy
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure 1. Werehog chili 2. Skating tendency 3. Alternative universe runners 4. Master Emerald is unbreakable 5. Gust emerald 6. Angel Island ocean 7. Chaos control run 8. Sonicolion
I feel bad for shadow
Bro... shadow just died😱this is too amazing,love the effort you put into this,from the voices to the animation 👏👏👏
Perfect
*Oh no they are on steroids..*
i love this! just jojo sonic, tho this a glizzy comp
Ah the same music from the YugiOh video, love it.
Oh dear God the memes🤬memes
MOOORREEE MOOOOOORREEE FCKINNNNNNGGG JOJOOO VIDEOS PLS!!! I just feel the way I felt while watching jotato vs dio man you guys are awesome!
Wait, fix this: they are supposed to be skinnier
Is that a jojo reference?
Shadow DIO: “Eat some of this GUN truck!”
Sonic, if he lost: “I’ll gladly turn into a chili-dog.”
Rip shadow. He just didn't like chilidogs
Is this a Jojo reference?
He ate Shadow
Lol even if he eats in time stop he still goin super slow just freeze him and stop talking you twit
This has such strong Kiaba x pegeses vibes
The should be named ''chaos control''
K
0:00: This is cool 5:09: NO GOD DON’T EAT HIM, AAAAAAAAAAAA
Tails: *Is that  a fucking  JoJo reference*  ? Sonic and Shadow: *Mudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamuda*
Now fall guys video
HE should've said "CHAOS CONTROL!!!"
even if this is under the rule of parody, it still violates two series that i like   also, there IS one sonic game whose premise is similar to one JJBA game. sonic generations and eyes of heaven
AAllllllll
Does… does the ending count as vore?
You fool Shadow, he is the ultimate glizzy warrior
I’m going to get me a chillidog
The amount of fear and shadows voice when Sonic speeds up
i was the voice of sonic
hi
Part 1 : Phantom Chaos Part 2 : Bloody speed Part 3 : Hedgehog crusader Part 4 : Emerald is unbreakable Part 5 : Golden Ring Part 6 : Blue ocean Part 7 : Metal (sonic) ball run Part 8 : You think it was a name for part 8 , BUT IT WAS , SHADIOW
Sonic: "there's one reason you didnt win Shadow, you didn't love chillie dog's" Me: kml time has no effect on Love, Because Love dont stop😁😁😁😁
No muda muda or ora ora
Animation is flawless
Similar to Hit vs Jiren
I know how the stands are born 3 dog nights= The arrow hit sonic’s belly he was thinking of chili dogs Time after time=The arrow hit Shadow’s head he was thinking of stopping time
The true glizzy gobler
NIIIICE
This is so funny XD 😂😂😂😂 I love this
there are three kinds of fans that loved this video, Jojo fans, furries and vore fans
Hahahahahah lol
Crazy this reminds me of JoJo
To be honest I don't think anyone wants to be food
This is the most disgusting thing ever created. You know whoever animated this and designed Sonic and Shadow are furry fuckers who like overly muscular animal characters and vore. Fucking weirdos.
JoJo reference? Check. now that is my anime.
CHAOS WARADO
Alguien me dice que anime estaba parodiando
Despite the fact i don't like that this was a Hotdog eating contest , the Animation and the voice acting are awesome.
Sonic: takes a bite from the shadow chili dog Me: wait, this is vore
Ultra        Cringe.
Glizzy sonic
You expected Shadow but it was me Dio!!
"So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum."
If your lost you can look and you will find me 0:24 If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 2:08 If your lost you can look and you will find me 3:00 If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting 4:02
02:39 - laugh similar to dio's
Time After Time  AKA:The world requiem
u r the greatest
The vore ending
Yooo all them glizzies wtf
make vids more often
Sonics stand is a filler stand
Shadow is a loser and he is a stopid
at least shadow put the 4th DAMN chaos emerald in central of his stand.
Sonic must have gained weight after eating so many chili dogs. How will he run fast?
wAs ThIs ViDeO a JoJo'S rEfErEnCe ?
Кто русский  кто-то  што-то понел
What did i just watch
How many times do you think they said chilli dog
He stopped time for 17 seconds
This is on trending congrats dude!
Not gay enough.
Si shadow no gastara la mitad de sus segundos hablando ganaria
Stupid cartoons
Sonic you cannibal
Sonic’s stand should’ve been Sonic Boom
chili dogs the real power of sonic
What ? 😂
I was waiting for Sonic to tell Shadow that he could already stop time so whats the point of his stand?
It would have been nice to see sonics stand as the Werehog version from unleashed
Well sonic would obviously win cuz his the main character and he ate chili dog alot of time
"Ora ora ora!" Replaced with "OM nom nom!"
Huh a jojo reference
Matsu Nani?!?
What the freak
Sonic's stand should be called Glizzy Gladiator
Remember, if diavolo dies it’s canon
Who see ho  has the last laugh
I won't to battle  sonic
Fun fact for shadow: when the arrow hit shadow it hit on his head which get hes thinking stand im guess Fun fact for sonic:when sonic got hit by de arrow it hit in his belly (im guess) so he got the stand in his fav food
so this is what a james charles makeover can do for you? wow.
Is that ShadyVox I hear doing Sonic?   its great to hear him still doing his thing after all these years
This is a amazing video. Can y'all sonic female characters like that please I would really want to see that😊😊😊😊😊😊
Great, now i want  hot dog- IS THIS HIS STAND'S DOING?!
READ THE BIBLE Brothers and Sisters!  Repent and trust, believe, and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior so that you can be saved from your sins and have everlasting life and inherit the kingdom of God.   John 3:16 (KJV)  16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 14:6 King James Version (KJV)  6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10:9-10 ESV   Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  Acts 2:38-39 ESV   And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”  Acts 16:31  They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."  Romans 10:13-15 (KJV)  13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (KJV)  9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  Revelation 21:8 (KJV)  8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.   Matthew 24:6-7 King James Version (KJV)  6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.   1 Thessalonians 5:3  While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.   Luke 21:11 King James Version   11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.   Matthew 24:14   And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.   Revelation 1:7   Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.   Matthew 24:44   Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.   Philippians 2:10-11 King James Version (KJV)  10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. .......
Is tHis a Joj0 r3f3rEnC3?
Gross jojo ew image being a jojo fan gross nasty           I love part 7
It's easy to miss, but you can see that sonic has murder intent eyes
I wouldve added my chilly dogs into sonic one after stopping time
Pff knew it was a jojo référence even before the mysterious arrow appear
He could have added his hot dogs on Sonic pile.
F
Lol
there is vore at the end which is just basically the deeper side of the sonic community in a nutshell. glad mashed isnt one of those people!
Ok, but the name "time after time" is really good
Am I the only one who wants to see more Sonic x Jojo stuff like this? Do all the seasons!
Time to eat all the hotdogs
Does this count as vore?
Jonic
Wtf have I come across
Poor shadow
Why sonic sound like sub
I wonder what there stand evolutions are
Yeah... _You know that's somebody's fetish..._
Lost because he did nothing but kept talking 😂
Gotta admit, Shadow got himself a piece of a jacket
This site great
Wait but Shadow can already do time manipulation with Chaos Control.
the glizzy god
Sonic's bizarre adventure ringdust crusader's.
I remember when shadow put Tails in an oven
Ah, yes similar stands.
My 2 favorite anime’s jojo and hentai.
olololololololololololoolololololololololol
JoJo
Rip soinc s stand
Get ya Glizzy's
e a t
wryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy jojoreferences i m gonna wryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Jojo And Sonic On Trending....
CAN YOU MAKE SONIC AND SHADOW GOKU AND VEGETA FROM DRAGON BALL Z PLZ?!? YOU DID IT WITH MARIO WHY NOT SONIC???
Shadow fits as a DIO figure so well
CONGRATULATIONS on treating
I just skipped ten seconds    Then I heard sonic say I Love Chili Dogs
Sonic JO JO part name ideas  The Sonic Forces or Sonic’s bizzare adventure...  Part 1. Phantom Dream Part 2.Sega Rivials Disposition / Conflict Echidna  Part 3. Star Light Champions / Light Speed Warriors  Part 4. Choas is unbreakable / Master Emerald is not Crash Part5. Silver wind  Part 6. Chao Garden or Chaos Ocean Part7. Emerald Riders Race Part 8.Hoglion or Hogunleashed   So name wise part 5 and 6 are my favorite. For part 5 imagine Silver being shadow’s son or something and Blaze being the daughter of the boss. For part 6 Imagine Sonic dropping of some animal for a Choa in the Garden. The garden is like a prison for them and animists help Choa’s gain stats. The main antagonist could be either Evil Choa  or something. In the other Version Choas gets a shard of the master emerald and attains a stand.The sons of Shadow could all just be Shadow’s clones. But, honestly chao themed stabs seem cool. Like having stuff like the Chaos Choas and Angel Choas make me like the concept even better.  So meh of for the names. Part 1. Named after the Sega dreamcast. Which we all know that the console is long gone and the Sega vs Nintendo battle back in the day almost killed Sega as a company. Part 2.I got the name from the Sonic rivals game. Obviously every part can’t be about sonic (unless there are multiple Sonic generations going on). But, I was torn. Cuz part 2 is the last chance we see Hamon in full swing. The idea of Echidna’s in the story having to die for the hedgehog to achieve victory seems cool to me. For this reason either Tails needs to be Speedwagon or Big the cat. Also a big portion of things could be teaming up with the Eggman empire to defeat the great evil in thier quest to become the perfect being. Part3. I felt I had to put Star in there. For this I was mainly thinking of Sonic heroes. But, not many aspects of the game have to deal with the name TBH. Besides the fact that thier are teams so you could have a few team stand battles.Light speed warriors  is probably better name. The whole plot could be sonic adventure 2’s plot maybe. Part4. I personally Like Choas is unbreakable more than emerald is unbreakable. Just cuz emerald seems later than Diomand. I said Master Emerald  is not crash because of old translations and the fact the master emerald has broken in Sonic games.Imagine an Echidna trying to live his quiet life when someone breaks off parts of his Master emerald! Part 5. I spoke earlier about having silver as the hedgehog and Blaze as the daughter of the boss seems almost too good to pass up. Unless you wanted to do something with Shadow having a clone instead of a odd son. Silver and Shadow both have ties to rings. Like for shadow it is power limiters. If not silver as the main hedgehog for the part. I feel having tails in the crew as Mista wouldn’t be bad if cream was to be trish. Or it could be some sort of team Dark and Team Choatix mix up. Part 6. Love the names I came up with for reasons listed above. Choa garden being a prison and having special abilities when they fight each other seem so fitting. As does Choas being an ocean monster. Who gets powers from someone else as he wishes to break free of control from others. Part7. Remember sonic Riders? Not many people do besides the fact it was the one with skateboarding/ hoverboards. So a race around the world to recreate the Master Emerald or collect all the Choas emeralds seem fitting right? Having charachters from the rider games would be cool.  Part 8. I was stumped for a name plot could be like  part 8. And either Choas was fused with the main protagonists or it was the echidna and a hedgehog. The multiple balls thing would make more/ less since. Got the name from sonic unleashed.
I didn’t know sonic was a cannibal
casual cannibalism is casual
love songs
Does this make Knuckles speedwagon?
Why aren't there an insane amount of JOJO references?
Glizzy Stand
Amazing
Me: taking my hedgehog toy from my hedgehog 3:19 my hedgehog: how dare you, shall read my lips in fear, you may be a failure but when I do come to my owner...you I am sure I will bite your whole entire core of your flat behind core of the the black or brown eye off
shut the heck up you dont know anything about water bottles
This was pretty epic loved the JoJo references 😂
I request a Japanese Dub
The final Is :sonadow
Ngl, Time After Time looks and sounds really dope
I do enjoy the video quite a lot, but I'm kind of sick of fan jojo villans having the ability to stop time
Why is a jojo meme on trending
waittt i think sonic sounds like sub in his minecraft channel
This smells like a JoJo ReFeReNcE
*glizzy*
Shadow is like the Vegeta to Sonic (Goku)
Subs blox word did so good!
I really want a show of this
and thats not 5 seconds *IDIOT*
*random fat guy eating chilli-dogs*
I guess Sonic’s stand was actually Mario
46 in trending lmao
I wonder how many there were in total
_mistakes noticed_ 1:05 White glove appears on Sonic hand 😳🤔 1:09 back to bandages
Is this trash sonic or DBZ
Top 10 anime sacrifices: Shadow turning into a chili dog
It would've been funny if he just threw away the chili dogs in stopped time
I like how this promotes cannibalism. I approve
Damn, now I could really go for some chili dogs w/ extra onions and mustard
Duuude, you missed such a good opprotunity. "Theres only one reason you lost, Shadow... One, simple reason... You're *too slow.* "
Nobody:  Shadow every second: MY STAND TIME AFTER TIME CAN STOP TIME
OK but Time after Time is actually a cool stand name tho
Sonic’s Bizarre Adventure: part 4 Glizzy Gladiator
I was the voice of sonic
That bite left a more brutal ending than expected and intended
SHA DIO W
Good video but Shadow do not talk when he is fighting he is not Vegeta.😁
Fucking shadyvox!
Fun fact: There was a JoJo reference in the comics.
my 2 favorite things amazing
You didn't love chilly dogs
I can confirm, this is basically Jojo exactly.
Wow, this was really bad
What
Those stands are actually really Lit
Did he poop out miphilles after that or just sonic 06 as a whole?
*I'm not even yen seconds in and I'm dying this is golden*
R.I.P Shadow 1998-2020  Eaten By Sonic

i see fire
Sonic and JoJo are my two favorite things; this is a dream come true
dont talk with your mouth full
...
Was this supposed to be a parody because it just looks like a rip off
Sorry but I'm a shadow fan.  And I knew he would lose.  So that's why I don't like it.  But shadow does make a cute dog.
Why does every villain stand has to do with time manipulation 😂
When do we get Grunt Battle 5?
*"How fast can a hedgehog eat chili dogs?!"*  So said the ultimate lifeform, that is also a 🦔, and is now a 🌭. 😔
Missed opportunity to have shadow say "Chaos Control" instead of "Time after time"
minor plot hole shadow say "behold my stand" but he thinks sonic doesnt have a stand and stands are invisible to non stand users
Just a bunch of glizzy gladiators
Chili dogs
I am so confused
We're gonna get chubby
Poor shadow 😥
sonic's voice sounds awfully familiar... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOgwd1fhYjA
More sonic parodies pleaaaase
Gotta Go Eat Chilli Dogs 🌭
Glizzy gobblers
Ok.
I kid you not, his stand turns his opponent into a chili dog, funniest shit I've ever seen.
What the
Kha?
I mean,          Sonics stand is: Star Fatinum?
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure 2: Battle Tendency
the ultimate Life form fits more part 2
So sonic is a cannibalism 😳
I respect they kept jojo tradition and named the stands after songs and artists still
Did he just eaten him!
Sonic the hedgehog is now officially a Jojo reference
"How fast can a hedgehog eat chili dogs?" Even god don't know the answer...
AND HOW EVER CAN SONIC CAN MOVE WHEN SHADOW STOPS TIME!?
I Wanna Know!
Who Should I Draw? Sonic Or Shadow?
I'm not gay but this is unexpectedly sexy
XD shadow the chilydog
Demented funny and absolutely hilarious on almost every level I can think of 10 points LOL
Sweet Video
Ok
Sonic the Glizzy Gobbler
Is Sonics voice the subs world narrators voice?
im laughing so much that i shitted my pants
this is awesome! I think this should be a series. It's that cool!
Sonic: just hanging out  Cyndi Lauper and Shadow: TIME AFTER TIME
Um sonic that’s Cannabilsm
why does sonic sound like he was voiced by the guy that makes the voice overs on the channel "sub's world"?
ez a tartalom undorító
so you incorporated all of Sonic's Deviant-art trope in one PG rated YouTube video...i'm impressed
Is this a JOJO reference
_"And then he turned himself into a chilly dog. Funniest Jojoke I've ever seen."_
Goddamnit time after time just kept on killing me
Amo o Sonic, só isso mesmo
Sonic is canibal
The only reason you losed is... you kept talking Shadow. You frickin talked.
Does this count as vore?
Sonic sounds like sub
Well I’ve decided   This world is to far gone   Goodbye
The power of chilli dogs
“But you’re like a waitress on her first day in trying to keep up with orders” 🤣🤣🤣JoJo literally made analogues like that😂
When you realize there was  an actual JoJo reference in one of the comic books

Hahahaha this is comedy!! I love jojo and sonic
Please make more like this!
Sonic JoJo: Sonic Vs Knuckles
Is it just me or does Shadow sound like Cell from Dragon Ball Z?
Big WINNER or Big WIENER? 4:44 lmao
Shadow wasted so much time talking ow my fucking god
Sonic definitely should have said "The reason you lost.... Was because you're too slow."
What the hell is this?
Sonic Jojo 2: eggman's announcement
“Honestly, I wanted them to finish at the same time.”
Shadow shouldn't have been shocked to find out sonic had a stand. I mean he showed his own off to sonic. What's the point if sonic wasn't also a stand user.
Why sonic why did you do that with shadow?!
Sonic literally ate Shadow's ass at the end...
May your parents live more than the life of a turtle If,,,,,      by the way my blog IDEABATIC. BLOGSPOT. COM.
Wow I didn't think this was going to be funny, but it was. Also what is better Super Anime Bros or Sonic JoJo.
43 on trending let's goo
LOL
.........
I am disturbed.
I want this to be a series from sega
Did sonic arrow hit his a**
But what does he have his gloves in Shadow he does that's that doesn't make any sense doesn't it
It f**t
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that sonic ate shadow without any hesitation
Sonic sounds like the guy in subs blox world
Sonics Stand is Stronger then Golden Expirence Requiem
Shadow:he is eating in the world of stop time
This was cool and all but im still not gonna be Mercy.
Cool I won! shadow is a faker of course I won
Jotaro : So they are the same types of stand
I'm a little disappointed they didnt have stand rush cries, like "OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM" or something lol
Shadow Chillidog ... I wonder how it tastes? But i think it would be horrible 🤕🤢 .... But because Sonic loooove Chillidogs so much he din't fell Shadow Chillidog horrrible
Oh man....  Sonic : I love chillidogs shadow i can eat more than 1000 Shadow: Thats too much😵
Never question sonics conviction for chill dogs
Sonic is the voice of scetch narrator
This is awesome! Check out our page for our cartoons and podcast and help our low low low subscriber account PLEASEEEEE!!!
Why are they even fighting?
I think jojo was too not so family friendly for little timmy so he needed to do this
they the real glizzy gladiators
This video was impressive and the animation is great but don’t let that distract you from the fact that Hisoka’s Bungee Gum possesses the power of both rubber and gum!
I just LOVE watching two muscular - fictional hedgehogs have a chili dog eating competition.
*is that a jojo ref-*
Who realized that sonic ate shadows d*ck
Trump 2020
I know Sonics voice
Spoiler alert for part 6! Stand' s user: Sonic Stand' s name: Three Dog Night               Sub-stand' s name: Made in heaven
Chilly dog shadow is just pickle rick
So it's the same type of stand as star platinum.
<3
This counts as sonic vore and I bet could be posted on r34 without a singe person caring
This was the dumbest fuckin thing I’ve ever seen, actually thought it was gonna be something cool or good ??
Sonic's stand are a big chilli dog
This is litterally sonic adventure 2
Nani?
Since this is in English they should haves used alternative copyright free knock off names. Like Before Time and Day of the Dog
I wish he called the hotdogs, glizzys for the vid
What are yall smoking when you come up with this stuff?
What the fudge
Everybody watching this will be Rich 💯💯💯🤑🤑
Eventually sonic ate so many chilli dogs that he stopped thinking
Am I the only one who got YU-GI-OH vibe?
I exspected "Time stop the world"
I did the drawing
The anime is called jojo's bizarre adventure and this is truly bizarre
5:07 Did Sonic just eat Shadow's ass?
when it starts with 300 chilli-dogs with sonic vs shadow vs classic sonic (or sonic and classic sonic vs shadow), 2 seconds later, he done and he orders 10 more 300 chilli-dogs.
The only question is......Why though?
Nunca ví Jojo, pero esta versión de Sonic me divirtió.
if he is, he could be with the buff sonic
it could be 1v1v1 like sonic vs shadow vs classic sonic (normal)
or if its like a chilli-dog tower with 50 thousand chilli-dog, he could eat it in like 1 minute (60 seconds)
if classic sonic was there, but he is like normal himself like he fat (im not bullying the classic sonic ;-;) he could eat 300 chilli-dogs in 2 seconds
Why did that chilli dog slip out of shadow's mouth like that
What happened here! Lol
What the hot dog man?!?!?!?!
Sonic bizarre speed aventure: hot dog crussader
I hate sonic
Never in my life have I needed something and never known it
MAKE THIS A SERIES
The voice of sonic remebers me of subs blox world
How about chronostasis
*[ insert jojo reference here ]*
"Time after time"... Pfff wtf is that bullshit?   *CAOS CONTROL!*
Guess how many Chilli dog piece before start the contest
This video is so bad that
Can you do the ROADA ROLLA DA ?
It turned into vore at the end. Another sonic vore 😭😭😭
1:53 I swear I thought was gonna say “so...many...GLIZZIES”
Sounds laek sub
Lol i love the 3 dog night rep in this. For those unaware its a old band
In theory, there is only dio that has been pierced by the arrow.
It is remind me about the battle between jotaro and dio but this is more funnyXD
Shadow vs Kars I want it now
Stand user : knuckels Stand name : monaka  Stand ability : double powered nipples
The only thing that bothers me in this video and in the franchise in general os that they eat chili dogs *with the white gloves*
I lost my shit when Sonic moved in stopped time. I knew this was a big Jojo reference but for some reason it caught me off guard and got me. Well done.
He should have said your to slow at the end
You will know the truth 📖 and the truth will set you free. Free from the world the flesh and the devil 💀🔥 John 8:32   We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17
Ok ok sonic sounds like the YouTuber subs world.
Kinda like a preference that basically requires Yu-Gi-Oh, except your taste buds are the opponent, pretty hard core, kinda.
Pfffffffffffffff🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hate you
So sonic ate shadows ASS in the end
I am pleasantly surprised! The comments aren't filled with fetishists.
Brings a whole new meaning to 'Emerald Splash'
Vore
Thought this was a gainer fic, aaww.  Hey, at least we got to watch Sonic eat Shadow's sausage.
Once the competition started I thought he was gonna be finished eating all of them.
I saw this on tiktok and wanted to watch the whole thing from the creator. And lemme tell ya. I'VE LOVED IT! Great voice Acting, Great Animation and so sonic be like Keep up the good work! Definitly gonna check out the rest of your content
Is this... vore?
I smell a jojo reference
Did anyone notice that Sonics voice is actually subs manager
He ate him to gain his powers.I respect that
Oh you're approaching me
Evil sonic is DIO and sonic is JOTARO. Shadow: Your next, sonic. Sonic: Im going to eat chilli dogs.
Sooooo is anybody gonna comment that Sonic commits VORE!?!
i hate to ruin this but... Sonic just ate Shadows ass, is this canon now?
I did not expect Shadow to be casually eaten.
TIME AFTER TIME
Some make an alternate version of this
A second part? :3
Is three dog night a band of some sort. Very clever
3:25 this mouth looks familiar
This was very fun Shadows Voice is pretty cool sounding I don't know why but at the beginning almost remind me of Yu-Gi-Oh when Kaiba and Yugi are fighting it out but I know this is Jojo amazing work guys keep it up this made my day ☺
More sonic content!
Such an amazing video. Deserves 10 billion views! Make more!
This is awesome
Weird people that doesn't read the title: *Confusion itensifies*
I love jojo's bizarre adventure its awesome!!👌👍
I'm sorry but, i was not prepared for him to actually eat shadow at the end, does like the stand gain the powers now or?
The ultimate chili dog.
I would love to see this in japanese dub
As a sonic fan and a jojo fan I genuinely like this.
Reminds me of the sonic x precure
It's JoJo reference?
Waaaas the name "time after time" meant to imply something about there being... uh time after his stand? Like I dunno things run at a double speed after he freezes time meaning people have "extra time" to make up for extra bit he took by freezing time, ergo "time after time"?
0:39  Shadow:HOHO SONIC YOUR REALLY APPROACHING ME    Sonic: I got to get close if I’m gonna beat ur ass
Sonic is the Ultimate Glizzy Guzzler
Three Dog Night is a real band.  It's.  A real thing.
За отсылку на JoJo лайк
I like how the five seconds are seven minutes.
Maybe if Shadow did not wast so much time talking BS he could be able to beat Sonic.
shadows stand should've been called chaos control
Shadow: “With this stand, I’m able to STOP TIME!” Me: “YOU KNOW CHAOS CONTROL YOU BEAN!!!”
Of course there is "vore" at the end of a Sonic fanfic.
HOLD UP   ...................        THERE WEARING CLOTHING?!
The one video sonic eats shadow and it isn't sexual
So it’s the same type of stand as Three Dog Night.
This is so jojo it give me a stand
neat!
Darby X Dio= Best battle
at the end there sonic should have instead said "You're too slow"
Maybe if Shadio just shut up and ate instead of monologuing, he'd of won.
This is amazing bro
Bru sonic is the narator from sub
Why
This is the cheesiest shit and I love it
Glizzy stand
Becomith the glizzith
Maybe ir Shadow don't talked instead eating he would win
well then... that was mildly terrifying
it’s like I watched the real anime
Was expecting shadow to just go "how about i beat yo ass"
Shadow: Didn’t I tell you?!? I CAN STOP TIME!  Me: So it's the same Stand as Star Platinum
Weird fan fiction I stumbled upon.
He should have said you're too slow
*eats like a million chili dogs* *still has perfectly flat abs*
LMAO THIS IS TRENDING
Time after time  Not bad  Sonic: 3 KNIGHT DOG  Shadow: dumbass
For shadow it was the eating conquest of his life but for sonic it was dinner
Finally
Woah the voice actors ARE GOOD
Not going to lie I love jojo and sonic a lot so I love this vid ty for existing to make my dream come back to life
Yep, that basically sums up the entire Sonic franchise...
Vore
No one better say glizzy gladiators
GeT yOuR HoT dOgS
Shadows stand did one thing                                                      Stop time
You mixed two things I love 😍
I though ORAORAORAORAORAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA is going to happen
Sonic is now a cannibal lmao
EVERYONE should watch this NOW: “Yuri Bezmenov: Pschological Warfare Subversion”on GBPPR2 channel. Just go to the playlist. I fucking kid you not it’s absolutely worth it.
get your glizzzyyyyy
Is this where the guys from Dorkly went?
This, does put a smile on my face.
I played Jojo games on roblox I loved it
So no one is gonna mention how Shadow is able to talk so fluid  with 169 chilli dogs on his mouth
Was that a jojo reference?      Also wish sonic had the spin from part 7 but whatever
Bizzaro el final
this was so jojo
Friend: what’s your favorate anime?       Me: its dragon ball.
Y que pasaría si Gana shadow
I wanna see doctor egg man how polpo
I DIO AM THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORM NOT SHADOW
Sonic moved faster than time itself.
Now shadow is a markable chilli dog
still a better love story than twilight
Tbh, this was pretty cool
The vore shit at the end is the cherry on top 10/10
Sonic is officially the glizzy gladiator.
I love this video, please make more if you can
If feel  like if shadow had used all those times  he used to talk to actually  eat the hot dogs he would  have  won XD
Sonic: Shadow! How many robots have you smashed to get all the emeralds!?           Shadow: Hoho, How many chili dogs have you eaten in you life?
Shadow then learns that his actions has consequences
is this cursed or blessed please tell me
This is cursed and awesome
0:11 at dis moment, I understand we dat dis was indeed a Jojo refrence.
I imagine this video would later be Japanese dubbed so we can get the genuine Jojo vibes   NANI?! SONA BAKANA?! KORE WA?! And much more Jojo references
Do at part 2
this will be a bad stand for group fights, you cant fight in a 1v2 unless you are fat af
lol
Fun fact: Everyone else including me who is commenting right now hasn't even watched half the video yet.

It is so beautiful
"But your like a young waitress on her first day of work. Right when the dinner rush starts. Unable to keep up with the amount of orders coming in." Boy never thought I'll be hearing that from Shadow.
1:05 He has glover there, and no gloves later on
Only stops time for 5 seconds monologues for 30 minutes
Shadow can stop time with out stand  ͡°^ ͡°
Nice job friend.
Shadow: *WHAT!!!* He’s able to move in my world of stopped time!?                                                  Shinra Kusakabe: _winks_
I love how they even included the hilarious comparisons like in Jojo XD (the waitress comment)
Shadio
I think shadow is overcompensating for something especially with the "I'm the Ultimate lifeform"
Hey Mashed, could you make a series of Sonic JoJo like this and maybe make a battle between Sonic and Blaze based from the Sonic Rush game series but differently? If so, that would be amazing! Nicely done by the way.
No home sonic eating shadow
Casual cannibalism
gizzler
I can legit imagine this battle in a real JoJo fights...considering how Bizzare JoJo is...
Nice voice actor
Therapist: Shadio Brando doesn’t exist, he can’t hurt you  Shadio Brando:
Does anyone else think sonic sounds like subsworld
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA😂😭
ZA WARUD- I mean TIME AFTER TIME
As soon as I saw Jojo I am mediately knew it was going to be a standoff just like the end of season three
Shadow is one brunt chili dog
Ultimate Glizzy Contest
Best jojo parody yet. And the voice acting was great! Especially shadow!
All I see is Dio and Jotaro. And I LOVE IT
“HuUuHh?! Za Warudo? More like Za Warudumb!”
Joy to the World!
Who enjoys this shit?
Sonics a glizzy gladiator
This is how JoJo should’ve ended
As a fellow man of Culture This is extremely Accurate.
Part 9 looks so fucking cool
I was hoping for a chaos control
Plot twist... that wasn’t Sonics stand, he paid the local hot dog vender and he hid his actual stand
Glizzy knight
This is sadly VERY jojo
Sonic sounds exactly like subs world. Same voice?
Shadio: Hoho, so you're going to approach me? Sonicojo: *GOTTA GO FAST*
"Sonic is EATING!" Easily my favorite part XD
Ok so uh               *Blursed *
So this is basically vore
Mashed like shash
Real gillzy gladiator right here
vore
There was an actual jojo reference In one of the comics
He ate shadow wiener first.
I have no idea what the hell is happening but I'm WHEEZING
Sonic: There’s one simple answer to why you lost... Me: ...and that’s monologue.
“However my limit to stop time is limited to my 5 seconds!” Also Shadow: *Monologues for 10 hours*
The voices are REALLY good
Glizzlies
The Za Warudo effect was really well made
Que verga???
Animation and voice acting was great, but the whole concept sucks. The actual artwork, tone, and dialogue is nothing like JoJo. You gave Sonic and Shadow stands, made them act over dramatic, and then called it a day. Great mashup
You skipped the part where shadow donut holes tails and murders knuckles.
Están mamadisimoooooooooosss
WOW SONIC X JOJO LOOKING FUCKING EPIC
Is this... Yu-Gi-Oh?
This was very bizarre
Is that a jojo refrence?!?!?!?!?
That’s not a chilidog, that’s a Shadog. 🤮
0:25 lol 😂
sonic's bizarre adventure anime opening, please
WHAT IS WITH JOJO VILLANS AND CONTROLLING TIME?!
Now wait for part 2 where they make a Dragonball parody with Sonic
Part-1 Phantom speed Part-2 Speed tendency Part-3 Emeraldust crusaders Part-4 Emerald is unbreakable Part-5 Golden speed Part-6  Speed ocean Part-7 Steel Speed Run Part-8 Speedolion
Glizzy gobbles
Glizzy Eating Contest
GLIZZY
Literally 1 % people who are reading............May you parents live happily healthily for more then 💯 years😇❤️💙❤️🙏😇
I thought they were gonna make the "are approaching me" meme
The glizzy warrior
GLIZZY GOBBLERS
This is just insane
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?
Sonic sounds like Sub from Subs world
Shadow... you could already stop time... you literally gained nothing
As a huge fan of Jojo, i ask this: What did i just watch?
ZA WARUDO NAH⛔️  TIME AFTER TIME ✅
We need a entire séries
I’m.... Just gonna act like I didn’t see this
So, we're just going to ignore what end of the Shadow-fied chilli dog Sonic eats first? ... Yeah? ... ok then lol
I was really hoping that one simple answer would be the iconic "You're too slow"
4:33 sonic she got ultra instinct
THIS VIDEO WAS AWESOME!!! I did a reaction video on my channel. And man, who would of thought Sonic would have a weird but cool stand. Thank you for this video, I personally think it was funny.
Wait.... does this make sonic a cannibal
Cool
missed opportunity for the chili dog man to swap places with sonic, and the chili dog man eating all the chili dogs. just saying.
Sonic bizarre adventure
Or Shadow was talking way too much instead of eating.
Im confused, i dont know if to share this video to my sonic fan friends or jojobros
Thanks I hate it
This hole channel is so cringy
Did Sonic just commit murder
So is sonic the villain in this or is shadow
Za warduuuuuu
First Mario now sonic is mashed slowly becoming a JoJo parody Chanel.
OH SHIT
AYOOOOO, glizzzzzzyyyyy gladiators
Sorry man this is YouTube, not deviant art.
I really want an version that shadow wins... please babuska,can i have an copy that shadow wins? ;-;
wasen't that vore at the end you sonic sickos
This is glorious!
Bruh if I ate that many chili dogs I’d crap out my brain
Animation: jojo reference. Music: yu gi oh reference. Characters: sonic reference.      Nice.
I forgot about the plot and I just forgot that one of them was going to turn into one I just wanted to see them both eat chilly dogs
So...at the end shadow gets turned into a chilli-dog sonic eats him.  *V O R E*
Why would I eat Shadow????!!!!
Shadow went inside sonic, kinda gey not gonna lie.
They should have became fat ;-;
Sonics bizarre adventure
We need a part 2 because of how good this was like in part 2 shadow wants a rematch but in a different game and shadow is back because sonic pooped him out having him turn back to normal and shadow has poop all over him and then sonic wins again and their that all I got
So how many lives worth of rings did Sonic have to drop to cover that bill?
"Is that a Jojo reference?!"
Should’ve been “Chaos Control!”
More grunt battel
Nobody asked for this' but I’m glad it’s here
Glizzy gobblers
Jojo’s Glizzare Adventure
So it’s the same type of stand huh...
Is Sonic eating Shadow considered cannibalism 🤔
Sorry but........NO
Glizzy gobbler sonic
Finally, a jojo parody by mashed that isn't just DK being boring
Did you forget i am THE ultimate life form?!
Fan fiction has gone too far.
The glizzy gobbler strikes again
Sonic ate Shadows weiner😏
And then he was turned into a chilli dog. Funniest shit I've ever seen.
DevilArtemis: Okay, but why though?
“You’re like a young waitress unable to handle the dinner rush”  But that’s just it Shadow.  No one can handle a dinner rush better than a young waitress who has lost everything.
Does based on part 4
Make a part three will he gets shot by a bullet gun in sonic got stopped by a bell again then they had more powers
Sonic Challenging Shadow Shadow: KONO SHADOW DA!!!!
shadow the world, if you the reference like this comment
Sa Warudo!
Who was Sonic’s voice?
This is beautiful lmao
I feel sorry for shadow he didn't want to be a chily dog but sonic showed no mercy
Haha
Vore?
Did Sonic just ate shadows sausage?
They made shadow run his mouth instead of eating that's why he lost. They creator set him up
Geet your glizzy here
New type of vore?
I have questions.... Like all of them.
Here I thought this video was gonna be serious *TIME AFTER TIME*        Then it got better
Cos sonic eats speedy
Holy shit he ate him
🙌
Oh loved that vid it was awesome this made my day cause i love your content AND JoJo
Jesus Christ, who was from the very beginning, the eternal and almighty God, is light and in him there is no darkness at all. He is that true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own people and his own received him not. Therefore he bid all, even as many as will receive him to attain the power to become the sons of God. Being not born of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.   I used to be a sinner like you all here who enjoy this content. I even enjoyed this kind of music for a time during my life. But then something got a hold of me. Something that the world, seemingly now, more than ever lacks. The fear of God got a hold of me. For the fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. When I was born again I was able to see the difference between the light and the darkness. I then knew the holiness and righteousness and the wrath of God that surpasses the comprehension of the natural man. I realized that I was, quite literally as they say, on the highway to Hell. Even as quickly as the fear of God and the fear of death and the fear of eternal torment in the fire of hell where the worm never dies and fire in never quenched gripped my heart and mind, God showed me an escape. It was his plan before the foundation of the world, before he breathed his breath of life into man, before he ever said, Let there be light. It was the spotless lamb who was slain before the world was, that is Jesus Christ. The almighty God, nearly 2000 years ago begat a Son in the womb of a woman and called him by his OWN name, JESUS which being interpreted means the One which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty who has come in the flesh to save us. The invisible, eternal, Almighty God was manifest in the flesh, seen of men and angels and the apostles of Jesus Christ beheld the Word of Life in the image of his only begotten Son. And he, being the spotless lamb who was tempted in all points such as we but without sin and who, being reviled reviled not again, gave himself to be nailed and crucified on the cross and bore our sins on a tree. For without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. Scarcely would a man give his life for a just man and perhaps some may even give their life for a good man. But God, commended his love toward us all, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.  These things I say unto you all that you may have your hope in Jesus Christ, the light of the world, of whom any that shall walk with him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. But not just to believe the truth that I have presented unto you, but also that you may receive the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. That is by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. You must be turn from the vomit you’ve grown used to inhaling and you must be washed from the mire you’ve wallowed in. Therefore I say unto you all, Repent from your sins, start obeying God, of whom is life eternal, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is the plan of God to save his lost sheep who are still bound by sin and in darkness. Blessed are they who receive the call of God this day for today is the day of salvation and many are called but there be few that are chosen. Answer the call if you receive the love of the truth for the choice of your final destination is yours.
This was a lot😂
Make Mario And Luigi Super Anime Brothers 3!!
the orignal glizzy gobler
13 year old me is dead lol.
My god i love this i LOVE CHILIDOGS
It ended as all sonic parody’s do, sonic eating shadows ass
Gotta love the way their arms moving at super speed sounds like "ora ora ora" or is that just the JoJo overdose talking
He ate Glizzy Shadow? Ayyoooooooooo
What the hell is with the Shadow the Hedgedog
My Stand Is Called Time After Time, but It’s Was I Dio!!!
Jojo
My brain is melting
BUFF SONIC IS SCARY
I am super confused XD
LoL Shadow-Dio Sonic-Jothef?
Too much time on deviantart leads to things like this.
This is really good and well executed
But it was me, Shadow!!
HOORRRYYY SHEEEEEEETTTT
I guess you can say that sonic ate shadow out
5:07 thats fucked up
Shadow's outfit only reminded me of Miles Edgeworth
I’ve never watch jojo. But this might start it for me
*Can anyone do the Japanese dub???*
The glitzy gladiators
So swole and shaodw voice sounds light af to me
Is that a jojo reference
Soso's fast Adventure ?
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a blessed day.
Cannibal OH NO
This was dope
5:07 *Top 10 Anime deaths*
*So it's the same stand as Star Platinum.*
Its a hotdog stand. Noice
He probably could have one if he just shut up.
4:59 Is it just me, or are these constellation designs trying to depict specific images?
Anyone else felt like not naming their stands after their theme music was a missed opportunity? Sonic's In his World Shadow's I am All of Me
Wtf
Can’t wait for Robotnik and his good personality kintobor also their Stand [T-E.G.G.M.A.N.] and sub stand [PINGAS] vs Tails and his Stand [WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY] that steals his enemy’s intelligence and gives it to his user
Is this a jojo reference?
Why does sonic have a cock ring around his neck
Shadow: ah I see your approaching me Sonic: I can’t beat the crap out of you without getting closer
ok... eso seguramente es el fetiche de alguien en el fandom de sonic.
Lol it’s like if Dio fought young Joseph
Sonic's stand looks like a stand user that Kira's dad would of been looking for.
This is basically a part 3 stand vs a part 4 stand
Thi...this is just cursed
0/10 Shadow’s stand isn’t called [ALL OF ME]
Wow, this is awful. This literally looks like something out of Deviantart.
its nice... but japanese dub is better.
So... Sonic commited cannibalism
What the hell did i just watch
Tailskoin!!!
Well that was interesting
I love how Shadow spends so much of his time monologuing instead of eating.  😂🤣
He became a hedgedog...
Why didn't shadow just use his gun
Now JoJo part 1 and 2 was gory BUT THAT IS TOO FAR
خيس
I saw they were super buff and I thought is this a JoJo reference no nooo can't be "I was hit by a mysterious arrow" ah ok it is
Your not even good enough to be my fa-        *iLl MaKe YoU EaT tHoSe WoRdS*
His new name is the glizzy gladiator
Sonic commits vore on shadow 1945 colorized
Sonic's stand should be called "Ordinary Sausage"
I would think this was a parody, but it seems way too likely to happen in JoJo.
Soinc:1234567890111213141516171819WoW☺ Shadow:123456789011121314😵
You, you really weren't gonna give them their respective theme songs. Could've been; Stand User: Shadow the Hedgehog Stand Name: [I Am All of Me]  You have close to 30 years of Sonic music guys. I'm not angry it's just missed opportunity.
Neat
Isn’t that still cannibalism?
EdgeMaster69 JJBA version
The way that sonic and shadow makes everything looks uncomfortable
Hahahahahaha I Laugh so So Hard This is amazing
5:08 No no not the vore
Sonic got the glizzy stand
Sonic: Jotaro Tail: Giorno Knuckle: Josuke
Shadow pulled a kono DIO
Sonic ate shadows wiener
Sonic And Goku Are Same Vegeta And Shadow Are the Same But They Have STANDO POWER
Now this is the Gizzy Gobbler
Shadow as Dio is something I never knew I needed. XD All that’s missing is him screaming ZA WARUDO!!!
Me:wait a sec,I know that voice Also me:*watching sub blox world*say what now
He just ate him...
Moral of the story: Sonic loves chili dogs. .. And he's a cannibal...
This is a wild and yet unique Jojo-inspired Sonic the Hedgehog video ! XD Believe it or not,honestly not a fan if Jojo, but it was  still entertaining nonetheless! XD My boy Sonic the Hedgehog looking and portray like a sexy Ryu mixed with Marvel's Pietro Django Maxinoff/Quicksilver while Shadow the Hedgehog looks and acts like a dark edgy and pompous and over the top aristocratic villain just like  X-Men foe Sebastian Shaw mixed with Riku feom Disney's Kingdom Hearts! XD  And dang, what a wild and crazy ending: Sonic the Hedgehog is the heroic winner and Shadow is the wiener and loser as it should be! Great job! I give the video a like! ^-^<3
So nobody gonna talk about sonic eating shadow at the end?
Glizzy god
Wish it was in Japanese
I love the part where Shadow rejects his hedgehogity and becomes ShaDIO
Harmon was better than stands
Tbh I think this is gonna be gold from the title and thumbnail alone
After watching this, I realized it’s more a mocking of Sonic then Jojo so it’s good
The end was a bit messed up...
Sonic eats shadows Weiner and buns
I think sonic' s stands power is when he eats more chilli dogs he gets stronger and turns enemy's to chilli dogs
Sonic Bizarre Adventures: Chaos Blood Speedy Tendency Mobius Crusaders Emerald is Unbreakable Golden Eggsperience Stone Solaris  Speed Ball Run Hedgehoglion
*nani?!*
Bruh thiz is sonic unleasehed
Glizzy man
I regret seeing.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. Non-Duality✌️
Sonic vored shadow... lol.
Make this a series
Jojos references 😉👊 Yo invoco al taqueron mamón :"v
funny thing is i just finished stardust crusaders and this just made me laugh pretty hard
Excellent video!!!😂🤣

5:09 RIP SHADOW'S DICK  Meme in Spanish: AAAAAHHH MI PICHULAAA!!!!

Wait, was this all just a big setup for Sonic Vore?
I watch this animation 100 time and it will be never be boring
Sonic = Glizzy King
oh god this is beautiful
I love chilli dogs.
Imagin what happens if he somehow transforms back to normal (probably in pieces in sewers)
Only people who didn't come from Tik: tok can like this
איזה מעפן
Is it just me or does Shadow sound exactly like Vegeta? :o
I always sense YuGiOh inspiration in mashed works
Finally you give me my sonic jojo
I love you guys,      And plus I didn’t even watch the anime but some clips but this is basically it but sonic version
Legend says the winner got to smash amy
Don’t mix Jojo with shitty Sonic.

Didn’t know sonic was a glizzy gobbler...
Really thought he was gonna say you're too slow
That so funny i like that
So does that mean shadows become poop
4:41 ._. xD
Alt title : sonic eat shadow's wiener
Sonic and Shadow: The Glizzy Globbers Saga
ZA WARUDO
Vore ?
I, Sonic the hedgehog, have a spikes.
Cringe
Shadow: oh, so your approaching me  Sonic: Sonic Speed
4:34 Why am I seeing Sonic Boom's Sonic, and why It feels like I'm watching Cone Zone's Sanic Boom video there? >.>
At 5:05 I thought he gonna say “your to slow” but.... that works I guess
That got dark
Those hedgehogs really THICС
Pop
akai dalia be like

This reminds me of Death Note rather than JoJo.
Like dragon ball lol
NANI ???
I was hoping for Sonic's stand to be based on speed.
I made harlem shake in super Mario maker 2 come watch
Why does Sonic have the Bandages he had in Sonic Boom?
NANI!?
I thought Biden would be here
Big Weiner! Big Weiner!
I like sonic and shadow designs there are stronger with there muscles buuut one more question WHERE IS GRUNT BATTLE 5 GRUNT BATTLE 6 AND GRUNT BATTLE 7!!!
Am I the only one that likes shadow more than sonic ? I think shadow is bad ass
Watching this makes me so hungry
Yo was this a Jojos reference???!!!
Me looking around for a glizzy gladiator comment
NANI?!?!
The ending was basically cannibalism
I hate jojo
I love this too much
Sonics stands abilities is time stop and sonic speed
I thought sonic would just climb up the tower of chilly dogs and dive in head first  mouth open and eat the tower in like 5 secs.
🐔"If you hang out with chickens, you will be locked up, and if you hang out with eagles, you will fly."🦅  ✔️Follow me to Fly with Eagles.
What?!
Sonic does realize that he ate Shadow's butt,right?
Sooo sonic is a canible he ate shadow who is also a hedgehog and he was turned into a ‘chillyhog’ so yep Sonics a canible
So it's the same type as stand as the world
Time after time This will always be an awsome video  ヾ(￣^￣(≧ω≦*)ゝ
19 on trending in America!
When Sonic said “there’s only one reason you lost” I was expecting “You’re too slow!”
I'm gonna stick watching Yu-Gi-Oh playing poker.
Is.... is this vore?
More Please
i refuse to believe that this is anything other than a fetish video
My dad: What are you laughing at? Me: You wouldn't get it
This is so Good
Love Sonic and Shadow body 🤤💪
👍👍👍
If i was shadow I would have broken sonics jaw in stopped time
Is that a jojo reference?
GLIZZY GOBBLERS 😳😳😳😳😳
Dio vs Jotaro The world vs Star platinum
I would rather watch this then jojo
Shadow learned the ultimate lesson today... *NEVER* challenge the protagonist to a eating contest *EVER* !
after Sonic Boom
dis for roblox game
Does this mean sonic has unlimited food?
Watch this 2x
Better than original
Can't Wait until the World of the Heaven Shadow Ark.
Sonic and JoJo did I go to heaven
Missed the chance to say "chaos control!" But that's okay.
🤔 what is a chille dog eitherway its sounds delicious........damnit now im hungry
The lost potential to have shadow yell “CHAOS CONTROL” to stop time
I can't stop waching this
shaggy will win without even using 10% of its power
I understand anime now
Это достойно русской озвучки.
My chiallenge
sonic the REAL GLIZZY GOBBLER
The ending was just too dark
3:21 Ah, the plot armor's just like in the anime.
This is an abomination xd
5:08 Wait a minute...
What is with sonic fans and Vore?
Deviantart's wet dream
(No idea how to make a time stamp, or if it’s automatic) 1:25 So is Shadow the ultimate life form or the wielder of the ultimate stand? It’s either a battle tendency or stardust crusaders reference.
These "anime" sketchs are God-tier. When is the new Anime Penguin coming?
Kek Shadows stand is a Cydni Lauper song
That was amazing.
Chili glizzies
He literally just love chilli dogs  I mean you knew you lost when you accepted the challenge
This was better then actual jojo
The glizzly gladiators
Ok but why does the music sound like DBZ tho 🤣
Yare yare. 😒
i watch this moring to now
Isso foi uma referência a JOJO?
copyrighted za warudo
Leaks to the Sonic movie sequel looks good.   All jokes aside, these voice actors are great.
Za Waru-,D4C....this is the wrong universe...
5:09  Is this Vore?
Later Sonic started his own fast food chain.
😂
Could have won if he didn’t spend half the time talking
So chilli dogs can give a more poop rate (im talking shit here) (no pun intended) and turn into a chilli dog if losing this is basically accurate
What's up with this jojo craze ? Lmao
ATATATATATATATATATATA
I thought shadow can already Stop Time with Chaos Control, all he really did is reject his Hedgehognity
Should I watch JoJo? I feel like I would watch JoJo... Also, vore... Nice i Guess?
I like this parodies JoJo so well even the weird metaphors
Whoever is reading this, God has a plan trust the process.🙏🙏🙏
top 10 anime fight kkkk
NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!!
Glizzy gangstar
Jotaro: The reason that you lost you just one simple reason you just pissed me off
Y tho
Nicely drawn and the plot doesn't make any sense. Yup, this is JoJo's
If he speak Japanese. Time after Time Will be longer and faster. Just said zawarudo!
Is Sonic's love for chilly dogs enough to defy time or as he eats chilly dogs does he get faster
Quick question: If you were going to Las Vegas from Friday to Sunday... Do you wear your better outfit Friday night or Saturday night ??
5:05 and just like that a New fetish has been created
this is somehow weirder than jojo
Hello Mashed, we are the Russian voice-over team of KantVoiceStudio, can we translate your video ?
🤔
is sonic... a cannibal?
vore
Sonic's voice somewhat sounds like Goku's voice when he's either getting cocky or serious...I love it!
This video turned me off. And I'm a furry. WTH??!?  Edit: changed my mind. This vid is great
Been waiting for this one
I like the Three Dog Night Stand
You know someone fapped to this
Now I got to ask where to find these arrows that are going around shooting buff hedgehogs

Time after time will stop himself
This was fucking incredible. I cannot believe the amount of work and love that went into this

READ THE BIBLE Brothers and Sisters!  Repent and trust, believe, and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior so that you can be saved from your sins and have everlasting life and inherit the kingdom of God.   John 3:16 (KJV)  16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 14:6 King James Version (KJV)  6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10:9-10 ESV   Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.  Acts 2:38-39 ESV   And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”  Acts 16:31  They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."  Romans 10:13-15 (KJV)  13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (KJV)  9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  Revelation 21:8 (KJV)  8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.   Matthew 24:6-7 King James Version (KJV)  6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.   1 Thessalonians 5:3  While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.   Luke 21:11 King James Version   11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.   Matthew 24:14   And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.   Revelation 1:7   Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.   Matthew 24:44   Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.   Philippians 2:10-11 King James Version (KJV)  10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. ............
So we're gonna not mention that this technically vore?
Jankem kid intensifies
BRO THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS I LOVE JOJO
I thought Shadyvox quit doing voice work to focus on his music career or something.
If you are reading this just know that you are blessed. Amazing and beautiful don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I wish all your dreams would come true just as I want all my youtube dreams to come true thank you
He turned himself into a chilidog! Funniest thing I've seen.
Man, that Sonic design is close to those old DeviantArt sketches...
So at the end, did he just eat a shadow grizzle
Sonic loves guzzling glizzies
Is this a Jojo reference?
0:38 wait that's the narrator from subs world
Is... is Sonic the bad guy in this? Like he just killed Shadow while Shadow only wanted to win against Sonic, Sonic offered the challenge knowing one of them will die, so is Sonic the bad guy in this?
USE MY IMAGE OR LIKENESS AGAIN AND SOMEONE WILL COME AND VISIT YOU AND YOU WILL NEVER BE SEEN OR HEARD FROM AGAIN. UNDERSTAND?  I DO NOT EXIST. BURN IN HELL.  THE END.
I really want a chili dog
That outfit shadow was wearing reminded me of Edgeworth more than anything else.

Gulp them glizzies
Man....this is had a much better story than Sonic 06. Add knuckles for a part 2?
The OG glizzy gladiator

I thought Shadow was Jotaro until he said I can stop time
GLIZZY

Sonic unleashed hot dog guy
Shadow did good on his Vegeta impersonation.
Sonic Kujo : I don't know who am I anymore, all I know is that I love chilli hot dog

Shadow: wtf is this shit? Sonic: yea they dumbyass as dork
I don't watch JoJo, so I have no idea what's going on.
I never thought I'd see my favorite fandom and my least favorite fandom together in a parody ... great
As a person who knows both Jojo and Sonic lore, this makes me very happy.
Cringe
Awww......It was a great video but I guess I shouldn’t have expected Shadow to win....  Poor Shadow....
Nomnomnom
The hotdog guy is from Sonic Unleashed

Could we get Jp voices and English subtitles please
You can't have Sonic without Vore
You are so bad shado
Not gonna lie, kinda dropped the ball with the name, it's Jojo with the main characters of SA2..... Sonic's Bizarre Adventure would've worked on different levels... Regardless, amazing video
So wait... Sonic ate Shadow's wiener?
Bro did sonic become a cannibal?
ZA WARUDO
All the chances to call him the Glizzy Gladiator, and you didn't do it.
Sorry but This was to much for me lol
Shadow is a slow his lose sonic is winner
Bro wtf is this
Wow.....Are you F!@!ing kidding me.........towards the end, they COMPLETELY missed the oppurtunity for sonic to say "you're too slow". How did you miss that? Does anyone else agree?
Delightfully stupid!
is thatd hono regrrdeence
sonic is so thick 😜
Can’t wait for Sonic’s Bizarre Adventure 2

Mashed is the only youth her to ever make a sonic jojo edition and still make it to trending.
Shadow:hoho so your walking at me instead of running at me Sonic:it would be a waste to run at you anyways (I'm trying to make a joke*
i think ive this fanfic before on divenart
Glizzy
This matchup would fit more as part 2 Shadow being ("my Name is shadow I'm the world's ultimate life form") kars and Sonic being Joseph and the aja stone being a Chaos Emerald
Chiillii dougs stand lmao
Sonic Bizarre Adventure 2 Battle
Hope his becomes a series. ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ (Plus a crossover with Super Anime Bros.😏😏😏)

#21 on trending
Glizzy gods
4:53 Kono Shadow Da !!!
Omg! Who thought it was a good idea to give  Sonic and Shadow steroids?
Stand User : Shadow the hedgehog Stand Name: Time after Time
No sonic, his mistake was utilizing the advantage that his time stopping power gave him to continue talking to himself and NOT EAT HIS FREAKING CHILI DOGS!
But isn’t sonic faster than the speed of light I mean the guy could literally travel through time and using that in mind he would be able to beat shadow in 0.00 I can’t be bothered
Psychologically we are hurt and we are asking what is hurt and is it an image that you have built about yourself that is hurt and when that image is questioned that image gets hurt. Wherever there is psychological time that divides, there must be conflict.
I like how they set it in Shamar (from sonic unleashed)  instead of Egypt
Shadow is the ultimate life form. This is a jojo parody. Yet he got a stand????      Caw cawww
When sonic is talking he sounds like subs blox world
Ho oh are you approaching me
This is ridicoulous but funny after all mashed continues to surprise me.
NO SONIC DONT TURN ME INTO A DELICIOUS CHILI DOG  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So-Nic 🎵🎵🎵 Golden Rings
Yesssss more jojo reference plz!!!
Almost as buff as they made Knuckles in BOOM
I thought it was kinda dumb that sonics power was based around his love for chilly dogs but when they doubled down on it hard it became amazing.
Shadow: "I am the ultimate lifeforms that can move at the speed of sound and stop time." Sonic: "I fucking love chilly dogs"
damn the aftermath of those chilidogs though hide the tp casue there is going to be a tsunami after this
Equal parts unapologetically anime and unapologetically silly.
*f a t t y*
Shadows a real Glizzy gobbler
Glizzy gladiator
Anybody else hungry for chili dogs?
Epic
I get its a Jojo refence but not a fan of the anime. Though I enjoyed it which is good meaning you don't need to like jojo to enjoy it. Also chilli dogs lol. Amazing XD
This one is new
The only reason shadow lost is cuz he talk way too damm much.
I don't like how shadow was eaten he's my favorite character in the sonic series
Wait why time after shouldn't it be chaos control?
he shouldve said chaos control bc thats what he says in the games
Silver:its no use
ZA DOGUDO!
Anime
Is this a jojo reference?
Thought he was going say your too slow
Missed opportunity for "your too slow"....sigh
:v
What the hell did i just watched?
Man that was Awesome!!! Also I'm hungry.
You got to realize that if shadow had just not talked he would've won.
Surprisingly better than many of the legitimate Sonic episodes.
Sonic just committed cannibalism
i dont know what to think cause i love both franchises and the animation is also good...but i just dont see a chilidog eating contest as some thing epic
*Huh... well then.* *Sonic ate showdown’s weenie*  *I-I regret typing that.*
uhh, in Sonic Generations, Sonic ran so fast that he brings time back to the world, so time stopping wouldn't be matter for him, nice reference mashed.
THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!
I've watched almost the entirety of the JoJo anime series and I can say this is incredibly accurate.
When three dog night punches he screams a battle cry that sound like GEEET YOUR HOTDOGS. while hitting the enemy with multiple hot dogs
Why does sonic voice sound SO familiar???I swear I've heard that voice before!....
If shadow turned into a chilly dog after eating so many chilly dogs doesn't that make him a cannibal?
Shadow's stand activation phrase should have been "Chaos Control"
if only shadow stopped monologing and actually ate, he would have been fine
Hahah  4 eyes
Is that a JoJo reference;)
The Shadow-dog looked, eh... quite spicy?
Spoiler for dios stand btw
Roses are red Violets are blue If I can't get an *ROAD ROLLER DA* then *an oil tanker for you*
Sonic is the ultimate glizzy monster
furries?
Sonic: This is my stand.....      *GLIZZY OVERDRIVE*
Too many glizzys!
Does this count as vore?
My favourite franchises fused like this for a chilli-dog eating contest?!  This is just too weird.
Hahahahahahahahahah
Make a part 2 please
😍i love this anime😍
i can hear the muda and ora barrage when they eat them chilli dogs
C
So sonic just ate shadow alive, that’s cool
Petscope 2 pls
*Oh. Your approaching me?*
Was the voice of Sonic the narrator of Sub’s World?
best. jojo fight. ever.
Those chili dog noises are M o i s t e
If Shadow stopped talking he would've won
thats why sonic wont get fat because hes keeping it in his stand after all
Wow
SHADOW SHADOW SHADOW
Can i challenge Sonic? I Know i will lose 😚❤️
Kakyoin...... :(
Dio:zwardo!     Shadow:chaos control!!
That ending was fucked up XD
Sonic eats shadow
Knuckles would be polnareff
Wtf did I just which
Why are they buff
NO! I DONT WANNA BE A CHILLI DOG! NOOOOOOO!!!
C H I L L I D O G S
recycled music from the Yu-gi-oh plays poker vid
GARBAGE GARBAGE DESIGNS AND NAMES ZERO RESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL SHOW AND ITS PLOT. EPIC FAIL
Thanks, I hate it
The stand named survivor is the weakest, but even it is a handful. As of such, I cannot imagine Sonic's stand to be any more useless  Now if u excuse me, I am suddenly craving chili dogs
This video makes me hungry
Sonic secretly a glizzy stand gladiator 🤨
2017:  sonic boom   2020:  sonic  fastestt  adventures
I wish Sonic have a power of three power; Speed of Lightening Powerful, Gold Sonic Power, and Wolf Sonic Power, he have a creative three powerful
That was epic
There is a video in your reference
The character designs are extremely cursed
The true Jojo experience is Japanese with English subtitles
Hot dog
Are we just gonna let this pass like they was glizzy gobbling and then sonic ate this man's glizzy
Shadow:nothing Sonic:giorno theme starts And that was the moment he made he was fucked up
NOAH GET THE BOAT
I love chili dogs so as sonic
This is a pen！！！
Me lo recomendo youtube y nise ingles
joooooooooooooojooooooo
sonics voice is the sups blosx worlds narretor *INPRESVE*
The glizzy god
man you could say sonic ate his ass out
YAY SONIC WINS🤩🤩
ˢᵒᵐᵉᵇᵒᵈʸ ᵖʳᵒᵇᵃᵇˡʸ ᵈⁱᵈ ᵗʰⁱˢ ᵃˡʳᵉᵃᵈʸ, ˢᶜʳᵉʷ ⁱᵗ When he turned into a hotdog,     I guess he became a 𝕊𝕙𝕒𝕕𝕠𝕨 of his former self.
Sonic the Vore-hog
60k likes for part two?
When I was scrolling down the video list of the previous video I was watching. My JoJo reverence senses started tingling Me: Is that a JoJo reverence I’m sensing
Do I recognize a  certain narrator's voice from a certain minecraft channel?
Finaly a realy good jojo parody vid
funny but ok cool
A whole new meaning to you are what you eat
Stands with set rules are the most OP
Leave it to a Sonic fan cartoon to end in vore.
JOJO is one of my favorite anime’s, and sonic is one of my favorite game characters. Thank you so much for animating this
Why is shadow surprised about sonic Beating his stands power Sonic in the comics OUTRAN TIME after he was hit by Dr eggmans time beam And he reversed the spin of a black hole that then shot out a beam that launched him light years away and can go so fast he can go into the future and past by running
Time after time is a song too
Ngl i think shadow would've been the jotaro of this situation but maybe I'm just pushing my agenda that sonic should be a villain
What's Sonic's musical reference? Shadow is clear as day 3:21 Excellent job with the Jojo face 4:12 And to the voice acting I'm glad you made this because this is incredible and you don't care about the glizzy challenge
disagreement diamondback
Sonic's bizzare adventure: chilli dog is uneatable
0:55 I get he likes Chili Dogs so if there's more to this I don't get it Three Arabian Nights? Sonic is basically Darby Shadow is Kars & Dio 1:37 Sonic: I'll just eat faster than you can stop time
This is some serious deviant art energy
I am a simple person! I saw Jojo then I clicked
Ending the video off with some casual cannibalism. Nice.
Now this what I'm talking about Yugi-Oh and Pokemon are overdone What about Beyblade and Bakugan One is a metal sphere that can destroy buildings and apparently used in wars And the other is kinda the same but dragons
Can I get a f in the chat for shodow’s pp
Why do sonic talk like sub friend how  talk for him
Sub plays sonic
Haven't they become friends in Sonic adventure 2?        Sorry for spoilers
So does this qualify as vore now?
The voice actor of shadow is impressive
Is it just me or does sonic sound like the narrator for subs blox world ...
THAT WAS SO GOOD!
Sonics the real glizzy gladiator
Why was a video about an eating contest so damn intriguing🤔
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES! I LOVED THIS WAAAAY TOO MUCH! 🌭 🌭 🌭
"I Shadow am the Ultimate Lifeform!" Kars: Did everyone forget about me again
I thought sonic stand would be Sanic
HOTDOG SHADOW he turned into a hotdog that's the funniest shift I've seen
Top
the fact that I’m attracted to Shadow in this form makes me extremely uncomfortable and insecure about my humanity
So basically sonic loves glizzys
So... I guess sonic ate shadows meat
How you get a clip from Sonic the hedgehog movie 2
Meanwhile, Robotnik is like; BRRRRAAKKA MONOGA!
Sonic the Hedgehog eats Shadows long black sausage as a fat man watches.
I saw this over a decade ago on Deviant Art.  This is basically all they draw over there.
After all Shadow is the Ultimate Lifeform just like Kars Amys theme sounds a lot like Bloody stream Knuckles guards a magical rock sounds like the Red Stone of Aja Tails likes to invent stuff and was once a cyborg kinda like Stroheim Sonics most powerful move is to Run... NIGERUNDAYO!!!
Checkpoint
Sonics voice is amazing
The JoJo spoofs are the best.
Sonic bizzarre adventure
I lowkey feel bad that Shadow got turned into a chili dog 😢. Rip Shadow
Love Shadyvox's voice!
Why is this better than the actual sonic?
New sonic movie looks great
Yeah, it's ridiculous like the original
Still better than Sonic fan fictions
Yinsasin Hungaria ?
I actually felt bad for shadow in the end lol
I did not know I needed this
Now i fucking hooked on to this anime! MAKE MORE
this sucks and its so stupid I LOVE IT
dear god
Jojos is nothing compared to this
That was the weirdest face-off I never expected. Coming from Sonic and from Jojo
where are the overly dramatic poses?
Is sonic sub Minecraft
Omg rip shadow!!! 😂😂😂 Sonic ! He is your rival but didnt expect that!!!! 😂😂😂
Shadow: Timeaftertime can stop time Me:So it's the same type of stand as ZAWORLDO.  ...ah sh!t, did I get that meme wrong?
Sooooooo jojo
Cringe
Well now I know why Blake Swift AKA ShadyVox AKA Scratch21 hasn't uploaded anything, because he got featured in a cool Sonic / JoJo animation.
Sonic the cannibal
*Ｎ　Ｉ　Ｃ　Ｅ　　Ｃ　Ｏ　Ｃ　Ｋ*
THEY HAVE FUGGIN NECKS NOW
Sonic’s stand is literally just glizzy man
Oh god this is so anime
JoJooiooooooo!
Shadow's Stand was just slowing time
That was awesome!!!! Please make a sonic jojo part 2.
I would like to watch sonic but I don’t know what the show is called
He would've won if he didn't keep talking
Nice animation but im against cannibalism :(
I like the name of shadows stand "Time after time"
Best jojo episode
Umm stand?........what is this a Yu-Gi-Oh speech battle?
Damnnnn Sonic Thicc
If sonic boom's designs evolved and got worse XD
I like Sonics voice, I hope he wouldn't mind playing in a sonic film I'm making, he'd sound awesome
OMG, this is so stupid! Make more, for great justice! I want to know what will happen in Mobiusoh Town!
This video is destroying  my favorite anime
lol
SONO CHI NO SADAME  JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOOO
*H'OH? YOU'RE APPROACHING ME? INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY, YOU'RE COMING RIGHT TO ME?*
This is so weird
Ah yes, and sonic’s catchphrase would be *Green, Green Hill...*
é______é
The chilidogs for the contest were his former opponents
Que verga acabo de ver
I'm so confused, but I love it😄😄😄
Shadow Edgeworth
Ah canabalism my Favorite
I wrote the script for this one.  I hope this was the ideal Sonic stand everyone was waiting for :D
😀what the😀 fawk😀
This could have been avoided if he just didn't start explaining
Sonic nibbling on that biiiiiiiiiiig blaaaaaaaaack hooooooot dooooooog.......
What I'm wondering is that how are they eating that much chilli dogs and did not get fat from it? lol
This is terrible...just like the real Jojo. It’s perfect.
2:07 I thought shadow was going to say "chaos control!"
Sonic is eating the caill dogs
Shadow lost cuz he kept talking
Guess How many emerald has time after time
WTF
I saw the cannibalism coming before the video even finished :P
Shadow is giving me Kaiba vibes lolz
Stand master: Sonic  Stand name:[GLIZZY GLADIATOR]
I think this is just cannibalism with extra steps.
Lol i just started watching jojo 5 hours ago
No.
WelI, I guess in this eating contest. Sonic is TOP DOG. ( O u O )
Stop 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Full anime
Sonic typically killed someone
One of my favorite videogames with my favorite anime / manga ... THE PERFECTION
😃😃😃😃😃😃☺
Did Sonic just... Eat shadow penes?
the glizzy gobblers
Guys, I think this is a JoJo reference.
Glizzies on deck
I'M HUNGRY
Shadow the glizzy
I felt so bad for Shadow once he said: "I don't wanna become a chili dog....I DON'T WANNA!"
He should've been more concerned about doughnuts then chilldogs.
1:26 so Shadow Is kars?
*No one loves chilli-dogs as much as Sonic does*
Good lord why are they SO JACKED 🤯
Ohooooooooooooo yeah this is very cool video
Is ThAt A jOjO rEfErEnCe ?
Imagine if their Stands' names were, Crush 40 or Live & Learn.
Finally another Sonic animation  And finally a Modern Sonic animation
maybe if he kept eating instead of talking
xD
AYOO sonic a glizzy gladiator
Stand User: Miles “Tails” Prower  Stand Name: *[ I Believe I Can Fly ]*
well, now i can die
Yeah... ima unsub now.
time after time will make a perfect quirk
Jojo’s bizarre adventure
This is absolutely ridiculous
Why the heck does sonic sound like Subs world?
cringe
Part 1- Shadow’s Blood. Part 2- Emerald Tenancy. Part 3- Speedy Crusaders. Part 4- Egg is Breakable. Part 5- Golden Rings. Part 6- Silver Ocean. Part 7- Emerald Light Run. Part 8- Soniclion.
I want Sonic vs mario In chili dog eating contest
I dislike this. I thought sonic’s stand woulda been like a huge chao or something like that. :(
Hohohoho 👍👍
3 glizzy knight
More jojo referense
Shadow's stand:  The World Sonic's stand: Made In Heaven
What
Yara yara daza
It would be so funny that shadow didn’t care
4:58 I actually guessed what he was going to say next I was easy but how.
T I M E A F T E R T I M E
Nani!!!!
The glizzy globbers
We got ShaDiow
I thought he was gonna say "ur too slow"
sha DIO
Perfect as always
Most of mashed's latest animations have been sonic animations, and anime references. 𝙞𝙩𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙤𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧
haha yes, let me tell this guy my stand abilitys becuz i think im gonna kill him becuz im villain yes
F         F         F        F       ah good video for you also like that video 👇Like

Sonic’s bizarre adventure: Chilidog crusaders  Sontaro, a 18 year old hedgehog who lives with his Uncle Chuck. One day Sontaro got struck with a stand arrow and acquired his stand. Then he met a young fox named Tailyoin who was brainwashed by Shadow Brando. With his Uncle Chuck, Tailyoin, Muhammad Knuvdol, they travel to Apotos to save Sontaro’s mom Amy from a curse from Shadow in a final encounter to finish off the monster who took over Chuck’s ancestor’s body and save the world as they know it...
HE JUST ATE HIM  WHAT
As a Jojo fan, I feel insulted, but also complimented.  *It's a bizarre feeling.*
I'd actually like to see more contest related stands
Hit vs Goku vibes
I love this so much lol I need more
It doesn't matter now what happens I will never give up the fight There is no way I will run away from all of my frights
I love how they added the metaphor, very on point.
kinda interested to know what eggmans stand would be
XD THEY LOOK RIDICULS
Oh you’re approaching me? Instead of just eating your chilli dogs you come closer to me?  “Thing is… I need to get closer to to best the crap out of you” Hoho then you may come as close as you’d like…
I know sonic’s voice from somewhere but I don’t remember where from
Why I cant click the bell?
Why does Shadow look like he belongs in code geass (cough bad ending cough) doe
So this is like a typical episode of Jojo as in the writing
1:27 I am the perfect life form with the strongest stand i can stop time Dio and jotaro: am I a joke to u u off brand version of me
Gross he ate shadow’s bottom half first in the end. And I thought the smash community was the creeps.
LMAO
Sonic the chilly glizzy master
Glizzy bizarre adventure
Glizzy GOBBLERS
So Sonic finally gave in and gobbled up Shadow's wiener... How fitting...
I was really expecting Sonic to have a 'So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum' moment. It would have been hilarious to see him stopping time JUST to spite Shadow. By the way, were they dueling in Shamar? If so, nice attention to detail. 👍
I cried but how 😂😥 4:54
I can play as these characters in roblox sonic.exe the nightmare series rp
Я ничего не понял, что тут было сказано, но лайк за Джо Джо )
The best of all, is that taking in count that exist a hole Yan-ken fight, this is someting posible in JoJo
Not gonna lie, Shadow's last "Time After Time" made me sad. He just sounded so defeated.
This video made me feel hungry
long time no see
Time After Time could be changed to Chaos Control, the stand being completely green, probably with a diamond type aspect with something else. Since it makes sense with Shadow having the ability of using the Peridot Chaos Emerald, well everyone does but the most memerable being Shadow.
Bruh I was literally just thinking about this because of chaos controls time stop ability
Me: Trying to enjoy the video  My brain:   If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting Time after time
no "fooda foodas"? 5/10
This is pretty great
JoJo and Sonic in the same thing? i love it!
Can you make a another series of penguin red snow please
Sonic's bizarre adventure: Hedgehog Blood Sonic's bizarre adventure: Boom Tendency Sonic's bizarre adventure: Bumper Crusaders Sonic´s bizarre adventure: Emerald is Unbreakable Sonic´s bizarre adventure: Golden Ring Sonic´s bizarre adventure: Forces Free Sonic´s bizarre adventure: Steel Speed Run Sonic´s bizarre adventure: Soniclion
If sonic ate shadow that means he’s a cannibal
In jojo Shadow is a cheater
Is it just me, or does sonics voice sound familiar
I do NOT want to share a restroom with either of them after that contest.🤢
wtf did I just watch
What's even more bazzare, is that's I've been playing Sonic unleashed for over a week now. & the location has been taking place in shamar.
So the loser gets vored?
I bet this will be on some weird fanfic soon
NOT THE GLIZZZZZY😭
Is sub from subs world
If Shadow wasn't so busy monologuing, he might've won.
I prefer the sub version
What the hell did I just watch
Kinda cringe, but still good.
Like for jojo video
Sonic's voice looks like sub's narrador
Honestly this one sucked...the art was good sound music voices all good...the story though...even for comedy skit is depressing like a twilight zone episode mixed with food fetish fan fiction...from the point he said loser becomes a chili dog it just turned into a dark story for me.
Please make a yugioh part 2 please please
Shadow Very Lazy Stop Time Loser
wouldn't that count as cannibalism since sonic ate shadow?
jotaro sonic dio shadow
I felt weird giving this video a like.
Jesus fucking Christ  That was halarious
Wait why does sonic in this one sound like sub? You know that youtuber ;-:
“Hey what your favorite anime?” “Me*” well it’s complicated”
My stomach hurts watching it XD
What the hell did I just watched???
If you think about sonic is the worst stand user to fight against
It's funny how Shadow brags about his stand's power, yet both of them can stop time for at least 10 seconds. I actually expected Sonic to reveal he was using chaos control at the end.
wow...thats a dark ending
I wish i was really that buff
burp
You guys should make this into a series.  The idea is too good.
Glizzy gobbler adventures
Are we not gonna talk about how shadow is now fucking dead, or at least a chunk of him was ripped off
Cursed
Would a non stand user be able to see the chili dogs and table or are they part of sonic’ stand?
Shadow = Dio! I KNOW IT
Random Part 7 Spoiler: *Gyro fucking dies*
I see you kept the bandages from sonic boom 😶👌
Prefiro  os dois  como um casal
Sonic is grouse
Okay, JoJo jokes and all that, but like, why is the animation so good? And the voice acting is on point.
5:07 vore
Shadow would have won if he used all of his stopped time to eat
Epic anime battle.
DUDE YOU CANT JUST UPLOAD AN ENTIRE JOJO PART TO YT
I had a dream about this
He gets turned into a chillidog, funniest shit i've ever seen
*Sonic's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders*
I love how shadow does sound that he's talking while he's eating This animation is great
what
Wait isn’t that cannibalism even though that Sonic turn Shadows in a hot dog but isn’t that caramel Lizum even though you turn shadow into a hot dog
I was expecting Sonic to have a speed Stand like [Made in Heaven] that would cancel out time stops.
Goes to show gimmicky stands can be stronger than legitimately powerful stands in the right conditions
vore
OmG
We are reaching anime levels that should not even be possible.
This is dark
Sonic: So it is the same type of stand Shadow: Wait what? How?
Excuse me, what the hell
I thought Sonic's stand would be a lot more, interesting
I expected "Oh, you're approaching me?" meme, but it wasn't dropped in the video. I am disappointed but still a good video none to less.
Fuck, the ending is dark. Like that sausage.
this actualy makrs sense cause hedgehogs are cannibalestic
Even Shadow used time after time again and again Sonic will still win the chili dogs contest. He trust his instinct.
Is it just me or does Sonic Stand remind anyone else of Mario
f for  shadow the  chilli_dog
Missed opportunity, chaos control would have been the perfect name for shadows stand!
Aha, so that was where Boomer Knuckles design choice came from.
SHADOW:SPAMING TIME AFTER TIME.       SONIC:IM THE FASTEST CHILI DOG EATING HEGHOG ALIVVVVVVE!!!!
Just Finish grunt battle already
I like how sonic ate Shadow wiener
Maybe the next video will be a crossover with Bleach?  Tails (Ichigo) VS Eggman (Aizen)         P L E A S E
Omega could've been Shadow's stand, but yeah creativity is nice.
This was actually horrifying.
finally I have been waiting for this video
STAND CONTROL!
Vore at the end
Y make shadow look more badass than he already was expected the whole eating food fight thing
I look forward to seeing how Shadow the Hedgehog is going to react to this on his channel.
Sonic broke time🕑😲
Maybe the next video will be a crossover with Bleach?  Tails (Ichigo) VS Eggman (Aizen)
Shadow must be kars, Sonic stand must be called live and learn, Just forget it, this vídeo is perfect
shadow the chilidog
Maybe the next video will be a crossover with Bleach?  Tails (Ichigo) VS Eggman (Aizen)
Maybe the next video will be a crossover with Bleach?  Tails (Ichigo) VS Eggman (Aizen)
Maybe the next video will be a crossover with Bleach?  Tails (Ichigo) VS Eggman (Aizen)
So if sonics stand turns his opponents into chilly dogs can we assume that every chilly dog on those plates were ones shadows ally’s? Meaning that sonic is not only a cannibal, but he tricked shadow to eat his old comrades as well!
Oh boi
Why.....just why.....
His Stand is a hot dog guy? 🤣🤣
Remember when Shadow said "Za Warudo" in the Snapcube's SA2 video? Yeah, me too.  Also, I love how the same guy who voiced Luigi in the Super Anime Brothers video also voiced Sonic. Nice reference 💕
This is so funny.
Not gonna lie had my bois react to this and they lost their Ora minds
This is like a deviant art fever dream
feels inaccurate, Shadow's Stand isn't the same type as -Star Platinum- Sonic's
Yare yare daze
DIIIIOOOOOOOOO
JOJOoOoOoOOOOOOO
Everybody is BOOM Knuckles
As someone who has never watched JoJo this was a deeply strange thing I just watched.
😰 so...many ....hot dogs
I see this before but i don't know where
vree good😍
It WaS I dIo
JOJO
sonic: *menacing* shadow sonic: STOP EATING ME LIKE A HOT DOG sonic: you are a hot dog shadow sonic: your right...
Her: he is probably thinking of other girls Him: if sonic ate that many chili dogs, how bad would his fart smell?
Maybe the next video will be a crossover with Bleach?  Tails (Ichigo) VS Eggman (Aizen)
More?
0/10, not enough hair
It's too amazing
Sonic's bizarre adventures: Oil Ocean
Something in me has awoken and its not a stand
Bruh this makes me really want a new new sonic anime show
This makes me somewhat uncomfortable
Combine Resident evil and JoJo and i could live in peace forever.
Time after time I love that to be a stand name sound awesome too me to be honest
What
Zawardo
Tails and sonic pals watch this it was good and weird
can you make something like  the  emerald escapade video plz
Shadow: THIS, IS MY STAND!!! Me: THAT STAND MAY SEEM LIKE THE STRONGEST STAND EVER, BUT YOU FORGOT ONE THING! Shadow: WHAT?! Me: YOU FORGOT THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY, TO NOT ACTUALLY GIVE A SINGLE DAMN ABOUT YOUR ABILITY
Something tells me that chili dog affect ain't going to last long and shadows going to come out like a fucking chestburster
Am like jojo
Sonic no sadame
Sonic’s voice sounds like the guy who is Sub’s announcer on Sub’s Blox World it’s a familiar voice
Deadass both stands follow araki's stand rules in someway, Shadow's Time after Time being named after a song and stands like Sonic usually take precedent over the entire fight dosen't matter how overpowered the stand is unless it's really busted(GER and others)
I honestly thought it was going to be a twist that every time he stopped time the 5 seconds he paused were slowly adding up to time he had lost. So like first it didn't affect Sonic, but the second time he started moving slowly, third time he was eating in time stop and etc.
This is the most intense mukbang I’ve ever watched  Also the chili dog stand is honestly very creative!
Sonic's bizarre adventure: Golden Ring
Is there a song about chili dogs?
Glizzy stand
Did sonix just EAT Shadow? Is this a rule34 fanfic?
As a big sonic and jojo fan... I approve
Oh? You`re approching me sonic?
only if he stopped talking time after time he wouldve won the game.
sonic and glizzy man
Beautiful
Sonic lmao
vore
Only mashed can make eating chilly dogs look badass
I showed this to my parents and now they y won't talk to me again
2:44 They got the weird analogies spoken by the characters in the anime right😂
Shadow: Oh so you are approaching me Sonic knowing full well of what my stand can do. Sonic: I can't spin dash you into the ground without getting closer. Shadow: Oh-ho. Well come as close as you like.
I mean... Hedgehogs are cannibalistic, so makes sense.
I can't believe this, I don't even know what's JoJo bizarre adventures but some of my friends know ver much lol
DID HE REALLY NEED TO EAT HIM!.... like wtf??!
Earthbound jojo
Chili dogs being made out of hedgehogs is now canon.
Menecing!! Egg man and sonic
vore
Yes :) also is Sonics voice subs worlds voice?
Sonic vores the glizzy version of shadow
Я уверен что теилз остался в водонапорной башне
Yare YAre dazzzeee
Джотаро:  Соник мой старплатинум того же типа что и твой
they eating glizzys with no bev
What a well made animation,I enjoyed a lot, made my day.....I liked the story of chilli dogs....very funny...keep this effort up and u get every support from me....
I never thought that would be the way shadow was defeated, and nor did I ever think sonic would eat shadow. But hey it was a great animation, so keep up the good work.
jojo are you approaching me
All he had to do was not accept the challenge and just beat the tar out of him normally. smh
Shadow as dio give this video more likes, if I see dislikes we should make rouge the bat as female dio to haunt the haters thank you mashed productions sonic's voice is fantastic.  I must see everyone react to this video, now shadow became a chili-dog so wait did he vore shadow an commit sonadow.
So it's the same type of stand as Star Platinum?
Sonic just ate shadows wiener. Haha.
..........of course every creator of an animation they always let sonic win......I MEAN LET SHADOW WIN A THING
My real name is awesome
I'd say if stopping time is your advantage I'd think against sonic he'd still have a chance since he can practically do normal people shit with in a millisecond.
Jojo but for furries
0:53 He looks like Mario.
Shadow: I'll show you what Ninten- can do and what Za Waru DON'T!! Sonic: That doesn't even make any sense.
Gotta admit, the Chilie dogs eating contest stand is a very creative idea
Glizzy gobbler
Shadow: I can stop time! Sonic: We're having a chili dig eating contest. Shadow: ... Shadow: Oh my god!!!
This is so stupid OMG
Jojo is the type of anime were anything can be buff, i mean anything
Episode 2: Due to morbid obesity, Shadow, when he trips on a chilli dog, gets launched into orbit, creating a planet, inhabited solely by chilli dogs. Some say if you get close enough you can hear him screeching, " I don't wanna become a chilli dooooog!" A truly magnificent sight
I love how this takes place in shamar instead of radical highway
Not even the the chaos Emeralds can't stop sonic from eating his chilli dogs  .
Imagine having an impressive animation team only to make goofs like this XD
It look like they took drugs to get Buffy
Why Is that in all Sonic vs Shadow fanfics Sonic always ends eating Shadows Black sausage?
The most disturbing part is that sonic has blue arms
sonic eats shadows ass at the end
Best. Parody. Ever.
The 2020 Sonic Animated series was weirder than I expected.....
Hotto Hotto Daze...
This was ridiculous 😂😂😂
welp sonic is a cannibal i guess
Why are Sonic aRms bLuE???!!!!!!!
Amazing!
niggas out here being glizzy gladiators😂
Meanwhile Tails is on his way to become a Gangstar.
So cool
i hate this
There... Buff? So its sonic bufferations?
i am the ultimate lifeform and instead of trying to beat you while i still have a clear advantage i'm going to fight you in your own proposed challenge where you have a chance... yeah real smart shadow
So Shadow was eaten by Sonic...Not exactly a good death for him...
Is there anything worse than the original sonic movie desi— OH SHIT!!!
Missed opportunity to have them both go "ORA ORA ORA ORA" on their last stretch of chilli dogs with their mouths full.
This was really good!!
I thought Shadow’s stand would be Chaos Control, but I guess that would be a signature move for it.
Shadow:chaos warudo!
Alternative title: JoJonic vs Shadio
I'm sad at the fact he didn't say you're too slow at the end
Wtf did I watch
huh
Shadow Is like The Undertaker
Son-taro VS Sha-do
I like it but it looks like dragonballz
Tails stand would be Little tornado
That’s honestly horrifying
Oh that's gonna give you the shits something fierce.
if shadow just shut the fuck up and ate he would have won
Hmm. Muscles aren’t big enough. *0/10.*
Give me a sec guys i gotta go and eat some chilli dogs
why is there vore at the end?
This is cringe
Wait... If sonic just ate Shadow the chili dog... Doesn't that mean...  HES A CANNIBALIST??!!
Now I want a chili dog...
So... is Sonic a cannibal now?
watch at 1.75 speed, shadow talks very fast XD

Sonic's Bizarre Adventure: Chaos Crusaders

..........................
Sonic's blizzard adventure
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure: Chilli Dog Crusaders
holy shit
*The animation is still good*
Look a sonic vore animation
🤔🍺
Call me crazy, but I think this video may just be a JoJo reference
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS O _ O
How much crack?
And that's how we got to know that Sonic is actually a cannibal
I M DIO THE WORLD
Sonic x JoJo =  *PERFECTION*
Yooo is that a jojo reference
Sonic so fast that he reset the universe
I..I..what just happened
This is so bizzare wait
My JoJo brain is tingling.
YES YES YES
This is probably a JoJo reference, maybe.
FINALLY someone actually knows what shadow looks like
Ooooooo myyyy GOOOOOD!!!
When you out fanart the fanart you have become a god
Weird but good video😊🥰👍💯
4:57 so that's how chili dogs are made
sonic is like the d'arby brothers.
I silver, have a dream
Shadow is dio lol
Bunch of Glizzy Gladiators over here.
What happend to battle tendency
This feels like Yu-Gi-Oh banter...
Time after time is actually so clever for a shadow stand. Unreal
Ahaahahaha that is funny
What nooooo!!
Shadow Vs Chris Mclean
Basically this is a sonic x dragon ball x JoJo (reason why dragon ball bc Goku could eat this fast)
why I’m not complaining, But why
Glizzy gobblers
I'm gonna watch this in 80 years and still love it
Shadow: British Johnathan Dio  Sonic: American Jotaro Joseph
Why does look like furry wet dream
Everything is a jojo reference
Wow 😐😐
What Sonic and Shadow would look like if Sonic Boom went on for another 5 years
Even though I never watched Jojo, nice video :3
Man when sonic goes to the bathroom, you can tell which poop is shadow because its gonna be dark, or green because I had one of the Halloween burgers from Burger king and you can guess what happens next.
How did he move in a world of stopped time?
Shadow will never arrive at the final chilli dog.
The funniest part about Sonics Stand is: Compared to teh soruce, It is not even the wierdest one!
how are they not morbidly obese
Мляя, это шикарно, это лучший Джо Джо референс
Sonic is a cannibal
I,lemon Brando Approve of this video
Maybe if shadow stopped talking he would have won 😂
Thanks I love this and I love how sonic stand ability its basically osiris
I LOVE this!!!!!!!!!!! I'm a fan of Sonic the hedgehog and jojo's bizarre adventure >:D
Did Sonic and Shadow hire Knuckles to get them jacked?
Stupid Shadow, if Sonic wasn’t a Stand User he would’ve been able to see your Stand.
it would make more sense if sonics stand was a super sonic or some other transformation like that
Ludicrously ridiculous      I love it
why does shadow chili dog being eaten by sonic seem like someones fetish?
Cringe
NGL kinda just looks like YGO/Dragonball fusion as well to me XD Minus the Card Games, Also Shadow looks like Edgeworth XD
Sonic bizarre adventure: Phantom ruby Stardust speedway crusaders Chaos emeralds are unbreakable Steel ball runners Sonolion  Sorry can't think of one for battle tendency and stone ocean
Is sonic a cannibal he ate shadow
4:57 I'm a chili dog, ¡¡¡I'm ChiliHedgehog Shadow!!!!
I expected Shadow's stand to be `THE ULTIMATE POWER` and sonics stand to be something related to speed lol
Shadow:says he has the strongest stand   Made in heaven and golden experience requiem : are we a joke to you
Uh sonic is your mouth ok? You just ate spines and your apparently carnivores
Who voiced sonic it sounds like the guy from the channel subs world
As soon as Shadow said "I hate chilli dogs"...it was at that moment that he knew.......you know the rest.
that ending...... was.... jus wrong..... sonic ate shadows meat *vomits*
The genuine fear in shadow's voice about not wanting to be turned into a chili dog made me lose it
Dude... the sonic’s stand is so overpowered...
i am uncomfortable
Now there needs to be a Part 2: Fun is Infinite (or Phantom Ruby is Unbreakable)
Yada yada daze
still better than the move
Is this a jojo reference?
You don't tell the other person what your stand does. That breaks the first cardinal rule of JoJo's
Shadow: I am the ultimate life form Santana: am I a joke to you
Wwwwrrrrryyyyy
Jojo animations tend to be somewhat bland, but this is one of the most impressive animations both story-wise and style-wise, holy shit. It really kept me through the whole ordeal. It does the funny jojo but still goes on as its entirely own thing. The animations on this channel are a blessing.
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure  Part 1: Chao's Blood Part 2: Rivalry Tendency Part 3: Eggman's Crusaders (Robotnik's Crusaders in the localized version) Part 4: Chaos Emerald is Unbreakable Part 5: Super Sonic Experience Part 6: Emerald Ocean Part 7: Spinball Run Part 8: Sosonian
This is JoJo in every possible way lmao.
1:37 *wryyyyy* reference?
Mom: What r u watching som? Me: yes
Sonic the Glizzy God
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!!🤣
Well that was weird. Some might even say *bizarre*  **dodges rocks**
4:06 Sounds like Yoda
Shadow chaos control = Time stop?
Sonic is a cannibal confirmed
I like how shadow’s chest fur is one of those old times neck cloth things (I don’t know what it’s called...)
Typical Sonic fandom stuff:  Sonic characters with muscular builds ✓  Combining elements from othe shows ✓  Having a fetish in it like vore ✓✓✓✓✓✓✓✓
4:06 *EATING, SONIC IS*
Why is Shadow wearing Edgeworth's   clothes but in black
I am horrified by this turn of events
Me: *sees everyone talking about time after time, the song*  Also me: *hears Sonics stand name* OOOOONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER!!!!
sonic vored shadow
Jojo
Lik, Lik , Lik,  lalalalala,,,,,
I thought Sonic's stand was gonna be {You're Too Slow},
Is this... a JoJo reference?
yo it's sub's world narrator
i see yandex icon on hat...
I wish this would be a bit more fight based then just chilli hotdog competition but hey i got the joke lol😂
This is disturbing
how dare you make sonic vore funny
Waaat ?
Don't worry everyone shadow should be out in ... 3 to 7hrs
Lol Sonic jojo
I'm pretty sure the next one will be a silver hedgehog with his "it's no use !" stand...   However awesome animation ! :)
Furries have gone to far, Caroline where’s the shotgun 🤠
ZARUWADO !
GLIZZY
Nunca subestimes el poder del stand de un prota NUNCA haraki siempre le dará un power up del culo o en este caso un chilidog :v
Episodes keep getting worst
I, Sonic the Hedgehog, am a glizzy gladiator!
sonic is stronger than time.
Does anyone else notice that the person playing the voice of sonic sounds like the narrator from sub's world?
*OMG IS THIS A JOJO REFERENCE??!!*
I lost in when I heard Shadow stand. What do you expect for Sonic stand? xdxdxd          Ho… mukatta kuruno ka? Nigetsu ni kono DIO ni chikazuite kuruno ka? Sekkaku sofu no Josefu ga watashi no Za Warudo no shotai wo. Shiken shuryu chaimu chokuzen made mondai yo toitte iru jukensee ne you na? Kisshi koita kibun de wo shietekure ta to yuu no ni?
So its the same type of stand as Three Dog Night
Make more more more more
0:29 So its the same type of stand as Star Platinum
Ooh, like the Three Dog Night reference. Good band.
😮
Haha this was the most ridiculous final battle I've ever seen and I loved every moment of it haha
...         ...dafak?
Why do shadow and Sonic looks like Wolves?
when you can stop time for 5 seconds but time is stopped won't the 5 seconds never pass therefore timestop is infinite
Is This a jojo refrence
this video sucks
It's about time shadow has that dam fourth chaos emerald
I don’t think this should be allowed to exist 😂
Idk why them wearing pants is the weirdest thing for me in this video tbh
Are they even hedgehogs anymore?!? What type of hedehog has muscles?
oh god he ate him!
Sonic: puts shadow in his mouth "I, a Rule34 Artist, had a dream"
Thats pretty good, but I found One thing that wasn't how it should be.     Too little muscles
c h a o s  c o n t r o l
Is this basically a vore?
The ultimate glizzy guzzler battle
So it's the same type of stand as star platinum
That was the most intense 5 minutes of my life
Not the first time Sonic has ended up with the "Vore" tag.
Is this a Jojo and sonic animation
What did i just watch..?
This was amazing
I wanted to make a funny jojoke or something but literally what is up with the chili dog stand
Shadow would of been Jotaro Kujo
Sonic JoJo is faster than chaos control
Sonic is tired of being called Cartoon man... this is why he referenced this to prove He's in Anime
What about donkey Kong
Yoo the chilli dog man from unleashed
this video sucks
I love these anime content
Stop time only for 5 sec? Amateur...
Chili dogs.
*_Vore_*
Me watching this:   Shadow shut up and you’ll win
can we all get a wtf here.
Cool, i love when you make videos.  about sonic the hedgehog👍
Better stand abilities:  Shadow; All Hail  Sonic: Endless Possibilities
Truth is that he really wanted chili dogs and then got hit by a requim areow
he turn him into cilili-dog and sonic call him chilili shadow it is funnest shit i ever seen .
Holy
Geez sonic you hair looks god awful!
Shadow: I can stop time   Sonic: GLIZZYS
The Ora Oro Oro Oro is eating chilly dogs ingenious
Shadow lost because he was talking too much
I feel like this whole animated short was just made as an excuse for the animators to draw Sonic voring Shadow.
Stand ' chillie dog man Stand power: creates chillie dog Stand crie: neat neat neat NEATOOOOOO
jojo fans:did you call?
How much weed was smoked to come up with this?
Sonic: SHADOW !! Shadow: oh oh so you're approaching me SHADOW! Instead of running, are you getting closer?!
Lol
this hurts my brain
I LOVEEEEEE ChilliDogs🌭🌶
Youtube: Oh, you like sonic, and jjba? How about this also, I thought sonic's stand was named gotta go fast
Sonic Stand is Cool 😎
WTF did I just watch
GLIZZY
Every TIME Shadow uses his stand I can't help but think of the song "Time After Time".
So there's this hedgehog, Shadow right? He turns himself into a chilly dog. He is chilly dog Shadow. Funniest shit I've ever seen.
Sonic's bizarre adventure  Chilli phantom
MORE JOJO!!!!
It's the weirdest Jojo parody I have seen and I love it.
I too eat my ultimate lifeform clone because he didn't like chili dogs
Missed the chance to start with a long time no see joke
So sonic is a cannibal
Perfection
you can do betrr
Tim after time!  DIO: the world!
Lo máximo
Two Glizzy Gobblers
Yo what happened to sonics gloves
All I can say...               Vore
Lmfao
Would have won if he didn't do all that talking.
OH GOD.  They broke the rule!  They're wearing pants!
I'm glad he didn't said : *WInNEr wINneR CHiCKeN diNnEr*
This video disgusted me
I was not ready
This is 5 minutes yet it feels like 8 lol
*Damn sonic in 4K be lookin’ good*
Dogs
Im so done with this shit 😂😂😂
Sonic Hannah dream that she was going to eat all the chili
😂🤣
Sonic Golden win
Damn sonic just ate shadow’s chilli dog
Good God he's muscular
Screw all of that power, I want the ability to eat all of that without getting fat
Thats just Vore with extra steps in the end.
Ayyyyy lol jojo
Red streak speeds by, Chili the Hotdog
What is this?
wait... it's just Sonic and Shadow vore? That's kinda cringe...
is it me or am I hearing a bit of megalovainia in the video-
This was awesome! I was expecting Shadow to scream "ze wardo!" tho
Tbh 13 year old me would be simping over this version of sonic and shadow omg
This art style remembered me of the original movie design...
Stando Pawa
This was just too perfect
My eyes have been blessed
dang cannibalism at its finest
That was garbage I thought it was going to be a battle to the death >:(.
Why am I actually invested in the chilli dog contest lol
Jojo
Finally! After all this years! THE ULTIMATE WIL FINALLY HAPPENNN
its time stop
Kuso yaro!!!
Metal Sonic: It's no use. But why can't I defeat you? Sonic: You really pissed me off
This has entertainment  value above "Anime Parody"
weird thing: the VA for sonic in this video is the narrator of a Roblox channel named subs blox world.
ugh! all those chili dogs... I can't STAND watching them. 😐
I, Sonic The Hedgehog, had the best dream of my life.
That's a little dark there at the end
Sonic vs. Shadow: Jojo edition.
5:05 Did Sonic just eat out Shadow's ass?
Seeing this makes me happy.
There has to be a part 2 and I would totally watch this of it was a real Anime
Vore
jotaronic vs shadio
Soo, does this count as cannibalism or not?.
If shadow didnt waste time talking he could of won already.
DiC Sonic joins Jojo.
I’m very confused of what I watch anymore...
5:08 I can guarantee someone out there has a fetish for this
This has so many on point JoJo observations that it could only be true fans who made this
I want to get it by a mysterious arrow
The powee of sonic
The cringe is too powerful.
I was certain Shadow was only going to lose because he'd get full, especially after he said he didn't even like chili dogs. After stuffing himself while time was frozen, he would be an easy target to pummel into submission, allowing Sonic to finish at his leisure. This ending was good too though.
You was expecting MHA? Too bad! It was me, thunder Cross split attack! Wait. Wha-
Time after time really that’s the best name you can think of
Shadow is wrong. He isn't the ultimate life-form. Kars is
Heh. You even got the inner monologue right xD
Sonic X is looking great!
i have lost so much respect for mashed
Glizzy gladiators
Ah yes sonic the cannibal
Ha Ha Ha Ha that was funny
1 hour well passed
Super anime bros 3 My hero academia
Seeing them go from these small stick-like figures to massive built beings is a little unsettling.
toot toot JOJO warrior
If he spent less time talking he would of won. Dumbass villains lol. Monologuing
Even the hedgehog was able to pump up better than you.
The hell did I just watch
Was waiting for his stomach to rip from eating too many dogs at once because of the time stop
I love this
Nice
Its not the video we wanted, but the video deserved
Lol This is so inaccurate. These stands aren't ridiculous and ludicrous enough to be in JoJos
No one can deflect the chaos emerald splash
I’m sorry, but the second I saw the designs and how overly jacked they are, I was laughing. Love it already
Sonic's bizarre adventure: Starlight Speedsters.
Bruh why isn’t Sonics stand named, Glizzy Gladiators
My child hood plus the anime I watch
So, Why didn't Shadow just bail after he froze time? Or straight up kill Sonic?
Did you know that Shadow's stand name is a reference to the song of Cyndi Lauper "Time After Time" of 1983? And JoJo do it the same with stands name, so it's a JoJo Reference! But, there's more, this parody is inspired to the third part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure called Stardust Crusaders which takes place in the 80s and Shadow's  stand name is a song reference from the 80s, it's another JoJo Reference. That's a double JoJo Reference, holly s**t!
This... This is perfect... Thank you so much Mashed, you have a new subscriber
Wow
It's funny because both fanbases are considered invasive.         No offense.
So he's the ultimate life form with a Stand A stand that can stop time? Vs A character with plot armor
E
WHY DID YOU MAKE THEM HOT.
What on earth did I just watch! And why was it done very well! Help me!
Sonic joestar Shadow Brando Knuckles avdol Tails giovanna
All jokes aside the animation is amazing
OC. Do not steal.
is this considered vore?
didn't love chilli dogs AND boosting and postering.
Okay that's freaking terrifyingDean turn to a chili dog and then just being eaten alive while you're conscious that's like horrific where's the fall it's not even cannibalism biggest state turn to a freaking chili dog! It's this freaking terrifying if you think about it 😱
This seems like a real JoJo stand. I wouldn’t be surprised if it showed up.
Glizzy
Sonic’s bizarre Adventure : speeddust crusaders Sonic’s bizarre Adventure : chaos emeralds are unbreakable
This is cursed in many ways.
I just watched jojo so I just can't stop laughing after imagining deo eating hot dogs 😂 and still lose
Sonic a true gobler
There's just one simple answer. You talked too much when you're supposed to be doing things, like all anime.
This would have been even better with a Japanese dub!
Shadow's voice actor is awesome!
get noobed
This problably exist on rule34
I can't believe Sonic just cannibalized Shadow!
Oh how I so wish this was canon.
Shadow is dead
EGGMAN ACT 3!!!!
*NOW THAT WAS SOME GOOD ANIME*
Oh Christ! That's a dark ass ending XD
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure be like :
i was eating a hot dog while watching this lol
And then he turned into a chili dog. Funniest shit I've ever seen XD
Sonics stand ability is so ridiculous it’s perfect for Jojo!
The voice of sonic is the narrator of Sub's World
Glizzy         Gobbler
SoMo's Bizarre Adventure! (SoMo because sonic full name is sonic Maurice the hedgehog)
I never thought the Sonic fandom could get any crazier combining Sonic and Jojo   I couldn't be more proud
LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE! LIKE!!!!!
Wait if Sonic ate Shadow's lower half, does that mean he ate Shadow's d*ck?
Shouldn’t shadow call his Stan chaos controll
LEMME GUESS...             Jojo?
Sonic:So it's the same type of stand as 3 dollar knight
HE ATE SHADOWS ASS
The only reason he lose because he talk too much  There's two anime logics  1. MC's power of friendship 2. Enemy talking habit
why Shadow?! WHYYYYYYYYY
Ah yes, my favorite thing.   Canalism
I'm not the only one that thinks Shadow sounds like Vegeta, right?
He made the *biggest* JoJo mistake and immediately told him what his stand did. _Nice._  _A smart person would pull a Dio and keep putting him back where he came from Lol_
I thought shadow was gonna say chaos control instead of time after time but ok
Sonic’s Bizzare Adventure: Chaos Crusaders
To stop Time or give the illusion of stop time you must go at infinite speed to reach that point which would reacquire a energy faster then light its self or find some way to stop all matter from moving problem is mattet that stop moving loses heat and freeze and since you the only matter that is allowed to move you would probably gain all that heat and it would increase you Temperature at a extremely high rate
Sonic dream ITS every Chilli dog on around the world
Sonic eating gotta go fast!
sonic sound like sub world narrator
Sonic X's sequal; Sonic Y
Sonic's is actually kinda original and feels JoJo to Shadows is just a ze world reskin
I'll be honest.  Shadow should be in more stuff.  Nintendo why cant I play as him in smash btw? That's lame
Oh, you’re approaching me? I already have... *zoom*
FOOLS! YOU FORGET THE TRUE ULTIMATE STAND! BEHOLD! THE COMMENT SECTION!
Wait, isn't that cannibalism.
Shadow : you can't win against me I can stop ti- Sonic : GLIZZY GLADIATOR
STANDO POWAH
Time after time is such a clever name for shadow
The glizzy gobbler
Is this vore?
ZA WARUDO
Was that a jojo reference?
I too eat people who fight me
Shadow and waluigi in the smash.  That'd be cool
Nice video
What if that wasn't Sonic's stands final form. And it was actually a similar stand to Time After Time
Part 2
wtf did I just watch
Sonic is a glizzy goblin
Plot twist: Sonic can move so fast even stopped time can't fully slow him down.
This is amazing seriously I love this
Sonic literally took a bite out of shadows ass The artists are gonna have a field day
Wtf did I just whatch
I find it funny how sonic’s love for chilli dogs is so strong it can break time itself.
This video was inevitable. I'm just surprised it wasn't made earlier lmao
Stand user: Sonic  Stand name: Tails  No stats, Tails just dies for Sonic every single time
Time After Time does actually look and sound like an actual Stand.
Is that a jojo reference
Vore but worse
Dow
why didn't shadow say chaos control?
Emeralds are unbreakable
Finally I've been waiting for this
Isn't this a Jojo reference?
Whats chili made of tho? I haven’t heard of it before but it sounds like a salsa
Is that-     Is that a jojos reference
This was so worth the wait!
I hate this
Do a Freedom Planet video where Lilac meets Sonic.
Well I'm suprised they didnt die of cholesterol also the fact the THEY ARE WEARING PANTS
Sonic is more Joseph
Somehow, this is the most cursed thing i've seen.
Is it just me or is sonic a canible
And then he turns into a chili dog. He's called Chili Dog Shadow. Funniest shit I've ever seen.
Ok question time does that count as cannibalism
Excuse me waiter there's a Jojo reference in my Sonic~
GLIZZY GOBBLER HEDGEHOG WARRIORS
got the chilli glizzy's down their throat
I clicked on this video, got out, got back to it fifteen minutes later, the video has a new thumbnail.
well this is the best sonic animation I've seen in a long time
cool.... I'd watch a full series like this it looks great!
I don't watch jojos But this is the best shit i ever seen
Lol Shadow is Dio and Sonic is Jotaro  That ending I kinda muh wish my Boy Shadow won tho. But only if HE ACTUALLY LOVED CHILLY DOGS!
Just why
legit crossover
Man,sonic jojo's stands is an really badass stand😂😂
Sonic: There's only one reason why you lost Shadow. There's just one simple answer: You didn't love Chilli Dogs.
And we’re back to vore
Shadow is kinda less edgy in this
Is this a crossover episode?
Wtf did I just watch.. not gonna lie it was good tho
ohnow i want chilli dog
This is so cursed
I guess this based off Sonic Boom, because Sonic has blue arms and sports tape.
So a fursona vore parody huh
Im earlier than a white family in an airport
ok its funny for me seeing that almost all the commentaries  on this video are jojo references.. funny for me
Awesome Sonic.
KONO DIO DA!
I like more this  Sonic than tha normal Sonic
Is it me or is sonic the same voice as excaliber from the warframe animation?
44,972nd
Shadow is kinda dressed like Alucard
PLS MAKE THE ONE JUMP MAN VS SHAGY BALL Z NEXT UP
Wait, which JoJo is supposed to be Sonic?
Is this Hedgehog’s Blood or Balldust Crusaders? I’ve only watched Emerald Wind and I still no clue who Sonic and Shadow are.
Welp.... Vore artists are going to be having a field day with this.
Sonic vores Shadows. Enjoy this title
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
I never realised how well these two work together
Get your hot dogs
This is the absolute best thing I’ve seen on YouTube. Shadow would’ve won if that wasn’t Sonics stand
*BIG WEINER*
*Oh Sonic, you dirty boy*
*Not bizarre enough.* 9/10
RIP Shadow
Anyone else thing Sonics stand would be made of a sol emeralds
That ending was kinda... dark...
This is awesome :D Jojo's + Sonic and Shadow = amazing video ★u★
He can stop time but he can't eat chili dogs
Sonic should fight Mario next, Make it happen lol
Tails did you lay this egg?
I love this but the same time I hate it
Why does Shadow look like a prosecutor with a perfect win record?
I just got this recommend after watching the jojo openings
First we have Mario and Luigi like Dragon Ball, and now we have Sonic and Shadow like Jojo's Bizzare Adventure.
Stopping time is useless if it can't help you eat chili dogs.
Is this a jojo reference?
Hotdog Stand   is it a joke?
This has basically nothing to do with jojo.
SOSO AND SHADIO
This is so awesome
Isn't that cannibalism since they're both hedgehogs
Now I want chili dogs...
Not enough makeup
THIS IS...PERFECT
This franchise and fandom omega Disturbs me >w<
YES FINALLY A JOJO REFERENCE WJCIAFENH pFUHAPEWIUFCEJHUICFANHWIP CNPSJI PH
Tailichi Knucklesuka Mariorno Princess Treach Amolyne Shadio *Yoshi* kage Kira
Sonic have the most. Famous chilli dog cooker and that is a stand that is hes soul
Sonic: CEO of glizzy
isn't it canibalisam
as long as you say no i don't accept the duel sonic's stand is shit...
Every new Sonic video I remember the Rule34 one...
One shadow is based on dio and sonic is based on tdarby
Here's a dirty joke...          Sonic is eating Shadow's dick!    Haha how unoriginal
For a stand that forces its owner  into eating contests... Sonic is looking quite ripped.
私は影です
That was a cannibalism ending
Is that a jojo reference?
Shadow should be Kars, being he's the ultimate life form but in the other hand he was an anti-hero and a loner so I can see that it kinda didn't fit well
I think Sonic stand would be called "Speed Demon".  Although i don't know about how can work.
this hurt to watch
Glizzy
This feels like a Yu-Gu-Oh episode with Sonic Characters, featured by Chilli Hotdogs.
Uuugh it's the dub version
I dont know how I feel about this
Why.
Thats very jojo
but couldnt shadow already stop time?
;o
Where TF are the glizzy gobbler jokes >:l
Now we need Mario
Well, that’s quite *BIZARRE*
Nice
Are nobody gonna talk about sonic eating other hedgehog
Hi sonic!!!
Yeah yeah guys I wear pants.     So what?
its a jojo reference?
haha i just made a sonic anime opening yesterday then this pops up!
I dont technicly call her my stand, i prefer calling her my persona. I'll admit sometimes i imagine tohru from dragon maid is my persona.
BIG WEINER! BIG WEINER!
These are way too good. We don't deserve them.
Sonic thats canibalism
Wait a stand who can create food noice
You know shadow  could have won if he just shut up and ate
The sonic bizarre adventure LOOOOL
*THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK*
Enough with the sonic voring
Maybe he should fight Silver XD ??
Vore
Thy reuse the music from Yu-Gi-Oh poker night.
Sonic vs knuckles
bruh wat is this
Shadow: My stand can stop time Sonic: So it's the same type of stand as 3 Dog Knight
The glizzy destroyers are back
Best jojo part ive ever seen.
Wait sonic and shadow are both hedgehogs so... is this considered cannibalism?
he turned himself into a chili dog funniest shit i ever sean
He should’ve said at the end “you’re to slow”
Poor shadow got ate from the legs up.....hes going to feel every moment of that can we get a F for shad
I hope the Sonic the hedgehog channel learns of this.
Takes the meaning of being eaten out to a whole new level.
why does sonic sound like sub
Shadow really do be dressed like a f*cking vampire doe-
Sonic is a cannibal
You should have known that exepting sonics chalenge is useles shadow
The next thing your going to say is can't catch the hedgehog
Bruh         ;-;
None of the Stands are name after Crush 40 songs   When will these people *Live and Learn*
*_OH? YOU’RE APPROACHING ME?_*
Tag: gore, vore
TIME AFTER TIME
Really disappointed a bunch of black Templars didn't crash the video
Don't ever insult JoJo by crossing it with furrys.
im like 96.4% sure that this is a jojos reference but im not sure
While I find this hilarious, I know of the sonic fanbase.... I know the dark truth that the world has become a more disgusting place for this videos existence
Glizzy gobblers
Go ahead Mr Shadow  I am S'onic
KONO SHADOW DA
Somusomusomusomusomu
So fast
I’ve never been more disturbed in my life... at least it was worth it
Wtf
vore
i was expecting sonic to have made in heaven
Can we get a part 2 with silver
So, is this a Jojo reference or what?
Gotta Oda Fast
Next level Glizzy Gladiator
i am too disturbed
I want a part 2
What did i just watched. WHAT THE F**K WAS THAT
So it’s confirmed Sonic and Shadow are glizzy gobblers
Nani
why does sonic have luigi’s voice from the other reference?
LOL
Next thing ya know it's Silver Giovanna
How much were you paid to animate this Sonic the Hedgehog fanfic?
I like how when they are eating Chili Dogs, their hands are making the ORA ORA ORA and MUDA MUDA MUDA motion effects 😂
shadow got fucking vored
Missed opportunity for a Crush 40 stand
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
Where is the penguin guyZ
Someone show this Arin
This is like the best parody content on the internet right now
When Sonic ate the hot dog shadow turned into, he ate the bottom part.. First.
"jojo the hedgehog"
Technically a Sonic Vore fanfic
SONO CHI NO CHILI DOG!!  SOOOOOOOOOOOONIC!!
Yay
Man, I really Love this channel!, it has a insane animation quality and creativity too!, keep up with the good work!
I thought sonic’s stand gonna be an ultra buff ring
As a jojo fan this is dumb
welp, shadow is the "ULTIMATE LIFE FORM"
5:03...I would've bet my house he was gonna say "You're Too Slow."
I swear I thought Sonic was gonna say "there was just only one simple reason Shadow....you...made me hungry"
Subs narrator voice XD
Nice how Show's stand has chaos emeralds on it's body kinda sounds like how shadow can use the chaos  emeralds to use Chaos control
This is more like yu-gi-oh style than jojo.
Why do they look so cool
I thought sonic was going to say that Shadow was too slow at the end
! Masaka ¡
This is the greatest thing my eyes have ever seen and I love it!! 😆
Sonic is a cannibal ???
So sonic vored shadow?
Shadow could've been Kars (cause Ultimate Lifeform lol)                                                                                  But anyway...awesome animation.
Please...no
A dbz style would be fitting since...
I I WHAT!!!!!!!!!
Sonic's Hotdog stand vs... WALUIGI'S TACO STAND!
He turned himself into a Chilidog ! I'TS THE FUNNIEST SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN...
but shadow doesn't even close to dio's personality... however, sonic's pretty good
What Vore shit is this?!
Part 3 glizzy crusaders
Kars- I mean Shadow, the Ultimate Life form!
The infamous CHILI GLIZZY only the true will come to succeed
KONO SHADOW DA
Shadow as a chilli dog * Rule 34 artists : oho is that a new challenge I see?
But... do you know da wae?
Damn that's pretty good video
So that's how VORE was created!
Glizzy gladiator
As a jojo fan I love this but shadow LITERALLY breaks all stand rules beacuse not even Dio was able to stop time right away when time continiued passing but its okay
Sonic mamadisimo
Arms blue??
Shadow talks to much
Shadow is a disappointment to all Cyndi Lauper fans >:(
Is the new sonic?
Ok! That was epic!
Ew vore
Yare Yare daze
When sonic the hedgehog becomes an anime
holy shit it was 5 minutes. i thought it was like 2 at most.
I could easily beat both in a eating compation bruhhh
Not going to lie shadow looks quite dapper
I all my life I never thought I see shadow as a chili dog 🌭
Thats a burnt looking chilidog 5:05
TIME AFTER TIME: CHAOS CONTROL
All those Goddamn Glizzys scarfed down within nothing but a Mili second jesus christ 💀💀💀
U good?
we will SPADE and we will NEUTER until there is NOTHING LEFT !  >:v
i keep imagine kaiba voice
Looks like the dude did watch TerminalMontage videos
О мой бог! Люблю обе вселенные!🌟
Did.... did he ate him ?!?!!
Lol instead of puching there eating nice jo jo reference
Now I hate myself.
All I see is if a blue Goku was in JoJo.
Could it be that this is a jojo reference?
No clever name? Just straight up "Sonic Jojo"? Well ok then
ok but who else is disturbed by the fact that sonic ate a shadow-dog
Ye
Glizzy's bizzar adventure
Shadow is basically sonic but    with more abilities.  -Stronger than sonic -Stop time -Can teleport -He has immortality -Being better
this just shamen king but sonic
Sonic: There's only 1 Reason you lost ... Your too Slow
Why aren't their stands Crush40 songs? Also my stand Smash Mouth makes sure you ain't the sharpest tool in the shed as long as you put your hand in the shape of an L on your forehead.
Me: oh its 12:56 a.m. i gotta sleep. Also me: sees sonic jojo: sonic vs shadow. Me: *YES YES YES!*
After Amy Rose suffers because of her stand,Sonic,Knuckle and Tails go on a journey to find Shadow,but Shadow has stand users who work for him,Vector was the first one,that was mind controled by Shadow,he joins the group,later another stand user was searching for them,Silver,with his power stand user that have telekinesis powers,he is defeated but out of mind controll also join the battle against Shadow.
I think I wanna watch jojo now-
Did anyone realize that the voice of sonic(and Luigi from super anime brothers) kind of sounds like the narrator in subs blocks world
The weirdest thing about this video is the fact sonic and shadow are wearing pants
5:09 goddamn vore***
Shadow to Sonic - ラツシュの速さ比べか? オラオラオラオラオラオラオラアアァ! 無駄無駄無駄無駄無駄無駄無駄アアァ！
Its a Jojo parody with Yu-Gi-Oh music lol
What
I wouldn't be surprised to have found this somewhere in the Archie comics.
Wouldn't Shadow's stand be Chaos control?
Is this a jojo reference
Alternate title  Sonic eats a shadow wiener
Sonic´s bizarre Adventure: Chaos Emerald is unbreakable
Part 2 maybe?
All what I want to say after this is... *what*
It's stupid...
sonic vs scrouge pls
There is only one other place I see hedgehogs this unreasonably buff
Amazing anime. This should be greenlit.
This is a masterpiece
Shadow lost because he's speaking while eating
This is just vore with extra steps. I hate it.
Now
What the fuck did i just watch
Shadow: "Behold Sonic... MY STAND!!!" Sonic: "Ok, but I can see it." Shadow: "What... What does that mean?" Sonic: "You know what that means." (Summons Stand)
Shodow sonic satnd: zawoardo but his diamond   Sonic:hot dog man
Sonic: there's only one thing why u lose shadow Because your to slow
LOL HERE BEFORE NOTIFICATION
I've noticed a trend in Jojo that the hero's stand is some generic punchy boi (or time stip power in Jotaro's case) and the villains often have some gimmicky stand. Shadow's stand can stop time and Sonic's forces you to a chilie dog eat off.   Does this confirm that Sonic is the true villain?
It doesn't get more perfect than this
Sonic ate shadow out -_-
Dear God
2 sonics
This legit look like something that shadow and sonic will do.
My name is Shadow the Hedgehog. I'm about 50 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Green Hill, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Guardian Units of Nations, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.  I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.  I'm trying to explain that I'm a hedgehog who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Is the voice actor for sonic the guy from subs world?
Just realized them eating chilly dogs is their Ora muda rush.
So it's the same type of stand as star platinum
F
I'm upset sonic's stand wasn't crush 40
“Time after Time” is actually a pretty catchy name.
Nom nom nom nom nom  nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!... Munch munch munch munch munch munch munch munch munch munch munch munch munch!...
Now that IS really bizarre
Is this a JoJo reference?
Damn that got dark XD
no, just no
sonic adventure 3
Sonic stand is Sanic
Bro I've been waiting so long for this how could you wait to keep this from us  😭
Is epic
Sonic i dont want to be chillidog ÑNNNNNNNNNOOOOÒOOOOOOOO
Sonic got the glizzy stand
Shadow: Oh ho, So you are approaching me? Sonic: iM sAniC, ThE hEadHog
5:08 What a beautiful chili dog! **chew**
This is so crazy
Kono shadow da
Bro this ain’t no jojo’s competition! This is a dragon ball eating contest between goku and Vegeta only except there would be no winner!
This animation looks really good
fresh video right out of the oven.  e p i c
1:52 ( ͠° ͜ʖ °) oh..
Sonic's stand is basically like the darby's ones: if you lose to a challenge, you get turned into something. Awesome animation, btw! 👍
Dio:ZA WORDLO  Jotaro slight twich Dio WOAH WTHATUTS APF what HE INVADING MY WORLD OF STOP TIME
HE DID IT, FINALLY
less jojo more kenshiro
Im late again :D
did sonic just EAT shadow?!?!
"If you're lost you can look and you will find me. Time After Time".
all the people who disliked are the people who didn’t know that this was actually...   a jojo reference !!
Shadow: BEHOLD MY STAND!  me: you know he can't see it unless he is also a stand user right?  Shadow: oh crap
I was literally watching Jojo nioce  (Before watching this I mean)
ヤサなど
Do more of these  Maybe pokemon or minecraft
Is this a JoJo reference?! Who should Sonic fight next? LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW!!! PS SICK SONIC JOJO MERCH AVAILABLE NOW: https://crowdmade.com/collections/mashed
Shadow: I REJECT MY HUMANITY
I, SHADOW, will- wait, why can't I just kick him in the crotch? There are no rules in this contest.
This is so great. Thanks so much for making it!!
Useless XDD
Shadow: Chaos control! Shadow Dio: ZA WARUDO
Jajajajajaja, this its the best channel of animation in the world, wait, THE WORLD? TIME AFTER TIME
Honestly I thought sonic was gonna say “You’re too slow!” at the end
LOL
Now all we need dbz sonic and it complete
Meanwhile tails in the backround Tails: sonic you can't beat him (while bleeding from his throat)
zawardoooo!
Someone’s into this
*_When the Fanfic writers wanted an animation of Sonic eating out Shadow,this wasn't what came to mind._* _Thank God--_
*“YOUR TO SLOW”*
I, sonic the hedgehog, HAVE A DREAM!
Sonic: how fast can you go Shadow: how many breads have you eaten in your life
I legitimately hate jojo this parody isnt even inaccurate
Have you even read someone posting "First!" despite there being clear evidence of other people posting before me? I thought not, so now that can't be the first comment you read! It was me, Dr. Robotnik!
That ending was kind of disturbing
This... makes way too much sense. O_o I mean, this is so suitably bizarre it really does feel like Jojo. XP
is that cannibalism?!!?!
uum
Me, having never seen JoJo:  Why do Sonic and Shadow have personas?
cannibalism
Sonic's Bizarre Adventure
I have so many questions
They still have abs when they swallowed a hundred chilly dogs when I eat fries I fat
"If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting Time after time."
Shadow sorta looks like Yugi
Sonic the glizzy gobbler
Umm that ending is literally wrong on so many levels, shadow could’ve just exploded screaming I’m shadow
damn...
Nice
Sonic Yoyohot
GOD FOKING DAMN IT THOSE FOKING DAMN ANIMATORS CAN'T HIDE FROM YOUTUBE FOREVER 💢 I WANNA SUBSCRIBE TO THEM BECAUSE I LOVE THE WAY THEY ANIMATED 💢
Normal anime: Power of FRIENDSHIP sonic:CHILIDOGS
He ate Shadow ;¬;""""
You know it's an anime when they start narrating about there powers
By far not the weirdest thing to ever come out of the Sonic the Hedgehog Fandom.
Isn't shadows stop time supposed to be chaos control?
Gotta love that Unleashed reference
The real question is who is shooting the arrows lol
Oh...? Sonic... You're approaching me? Instead if picking up the rings you lost, you'd rather get closer to me?  I can hit you weakspot without getting any closer...   Oh...? Then come as close as you want..  GOTTA GO GOTTA GO GOTTA GO GOTTA GO GOTTA GO GOTTA GO-  LIVE AND LIVE AND LIVE AND LIVE AND LIVE AND-
it has a kind of Yu-Gi-Oh vibe
If instead of think and talk.. If Shaddow just ate it.. It could of had won. Anime villains tend to think and speak too much in battles.
first Mario now Sonic who is next Kirby?!?!?!
I like how "Time after time" follows the rule of stands being named after 80's, 90's and 00's songs.
blasto video would cool
Ahh, my favorite anime
heh....cannibalism.....neat....
I think this is a JoJo reference!
Incredible both maintain those "never skipped leg day" bodies after eating that many chilly dogs.
I think he lost because he was talking too much.
*your next words will be "I, shadow, am the ultimate lifeform!"*
HOLY SHIT IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE     - every JOJO fan
IS THAT A MOTHER FUCKING JOJO REFRENCE
I want of Sonic JoJo! 😄
I can comment this only one way: ゴゴゴゴ
Oh no.
Make some merch of sonic
Shadow: Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of running away you’re boosting right to me?  Sonic: I can’t spindash the rings out of you without getting closer.
R.I.P shadow        Because he became a chilly dog and then got eaten by someone who loves chilly dogs
5:07 wait...that..that isin´t..vore?
2:08 i found he gonna scream "CAOS CONTROL"
jojo and the crew: The enemy stand users are blending in.                                                                    The enemy stand user’s:
Disappointed, we didn't get a close up of sonic rolling his tounge around shadow dog
Shadow was just too slow.
Did he just fucking eat Shadow?
Sonic Buzzard Adventures
Sonic eat shadow wtf 😂😂
This is requiem.
Some stands are extremely powerful in certain situations. Like by technicaly, the most powerful stand us boys to men, who steals stands when the user wins a game of rock papper scissors. He has no consequence for losing, but his opponents automatically die when they lose their stand.
in jojo the go muda muda muda muda in sonic they go muncha muncha muncha
stand name: glizzy gladiator stand user: sonic the hedgehog
This is just how they act around each other normally
I do not want to know I do not care to know But someone somewhere most definitely got off to this
Is this deviant again
I don't like this
Damn that's deep. Sonic-kun bizarre adventures emerald's unbreakable is gonna slap some shit when It comes out.
ZA WORLDO
This is really amazing
The Chaos Control joke was RIGHT THERE
sonic saved the day by bein a glizzy guzzler
Okay but this was in my recommended, I didn't get a notification
Why the voices sound so right....
I love this
OH MY GOD SONIC WON.
Is thet a JoJo reference
Yeah that’s Jojo
Awesome Video 👍
I didn't even imagine mix sonic with jojo and here is it xD
CHAOS CONTROL
Wait isn’t this vor-
This Is How  Much Shadow  Said  I Can Stop  Time
The art was incredible and the story just everything was amazing S Rank job
Then he became a chili dog funny shit I eve seen
Sonic ate Shadow, another Hedgehog. That's cannibalism, and we all know Sonic isn't a cannibal.
Epic
NANI fun fact nani is a football player
PENIS!
honestly, shadow could have won if he didn't speak that much ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Tf
Did he really just said "Sonic you are just too slow"? How disrespectful!
They all took the same drugs as knuckles I see...
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
top 10 true anime battles for real
No I don't wanna be a chilli dog. NOOOOOOOO!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! Actually being a chilli dog is fine and I don't care anymore
This looks more like yu gi oh, plz dont get mad...
That was a true masterpiece.
Awesome
Either way, sonic would have won since he still ate his favorite food
Sonic ate shadow that means Sonic participated in cannibalism 🤯
WTF el final
weirdest fan fiction i've ever seen..
Sonic: "So it's the same type of stand as Free Dog Night..."
This is beautiful!
Chili hot dog right?
I hate this
CANIBALISM 100
No I don't wanna be a chilli dog. NOOOOOOOO!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Huh, neat
Eating da glizzy
I see jojo I click
Cannibal sonic?🤔😂
Time after time! STOP TIME!!                Sonic: Time is merely a suggestion Shadow-san.
Lol wtf?
良いグライフ
LMAO YES THEY FINALLY DID IT
Was well made but yikes Cannibal Sonic...good question is it cannibalism if they are transformed into food...Yeah yeah it is
Is this vore?
They should have someone say "OH NOOOOOO"
That's acc a pretty dope stand ngl
i expect more, but dissapointed in the beginning.
the last part is considered a rule 34  fetish
I love it !
Hmm that just happened
Что это за пипец?
It would be better if Shadow said, “Chaos Control."
Parabanz
feels pretty yu-gi-oh
Shadow you utter fool sonic will always reign supreme
Noice
peo man
This is vore
Furries are going to freak when Shadow is inside of Sonic.
Why is this so entertaining?
Does that mean if sonic eats shadow he will gain his ability to stop time
Is this......      *A JOJO REFERENCE???*
Mario: my stand's rule is that you must beat me in a mushroom eating contest and the loser becomes a toad
I like chili dogs too.
Классно
Not a fan
Shadow sounding like Bakugo
Come mashed do johnny bravo intro parody but we Captain Blasto please
The Faker scene is the Video game equivalent of the the "Oh your approaching me" scene.
Shadow : muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda Sonic ora ora ora ora ora ora ora
Wow sonic sure does love chilli dogs
Omae was mou...
I was so excited to see sonic’s stand, thought it would look like star platinum but no 😂
So you have come to approach me
I guess this means Tails got Tornado report and Knuckles got crazy Emerald
It's so bizarre video.
Thats so Sigma
I wish it was subbed
Sonic's stand feels like darby because it's just baiting your enemy into accepting
Dio vs Jotaro: Sonic the hedgehog edition.
No jojo pose sonic pose
First Mario’s Bizarre Adventure now Sonic’s Bizarre Adventure.

He should of called the stand chaos control
Clothes...      Good

Wait, since when was Shadeo and Jotonic get hit by stand arrows?
F i  wanted first comment
Man im so excited for the part where he meets shaggy
His arms are blue
Ok
Sonic doesn't move fast, he STOPS TIME. It's not that "he's so fast you can't see him!"  it's just him moving in stopped time! The JoJo reference was always right in front of us all these years!
Wat
I wasnt expecting sonic to have that stand,NICE
i thought it will show the dio and jotaro walk meme
what happend to donkey kongs bizzare adventure
Unbelievable man I thought sonic might have super Aowsom Stand
As someone who has never watched jojo but played the sonic games  I can definitely enjoy this in a wired way
Sonic has that Glizzy Stand
Is that JOJOreference?
I like how Shadow looks like DIO, Shadow and Miles Edgeworth in one
[insert like bait] ⬇️
Donkey Kong Jojo Bizarre Adventure Mario Bros Jojo Bizarre Adventure Sonic Jojo Bizarre adventure And what's next? Zelda Jojo Bizarre Adventure?😂 Tbh, i love the concept😁

Animated anime. Yare yare
Is this some elaborate way for sonic to vore shadow? That's about right when considering the fandom.
It's funny because I've listened to three dog night
Oh my god, I just fought a guy and he had a stand
Dammit this BS again come on guys make something original and new sure the Mario JoJo reference was hilarious but now when you hit the sonic it’s now just getting old
