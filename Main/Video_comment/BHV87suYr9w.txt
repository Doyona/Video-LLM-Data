Harrison and Raphinha total cost = £28mn. Orta is a genius in the transfer market.
Que gesto de Bielsa con el técnico del Mes Castle dos figuras emblemáticas del fútbol me omocione tengo un nudo en la garganta desde Punta Alta BSAS Argentina
❤❤
Vamos miggy saludos desde paraguay forever
Leeds United Power
Premer league poin
Need to see the build up for that second goal
What I found really worrying is that it was the 60th minute and Jack Harrison was already wasted. He barely can speak after his goal, looks like he is asking for a bottle of oxygen. We still have 20 more games to go in the season and players are already showing signs that their fuel tanks are empty.
Bielsa seem apologize to Bruce because he beat Newcastle to make that club one step to go to relegation. Bielsa feel sad about that
Buen triunfo de leeds espero sigan subiendo en la tabla, mis mejores deseos para don Marcelo Bielsa !!
Harrison's goal was a beauty! Placed it perfectly.
Rodrigo didn’t get the goal he deserved spectacular proformance from the lads 💙💛MOT
Play like that second half again we'll get relegated
GOOD WIN 4 LEEDS BUT WHEN U LOOK AT THE STATS NEWCASTLE HAD MORE CHANCES MORE OF THE PLAY ETC.I WILL TAKE THE POINTS ANY DAY
Disfruté este partido, pero también los sufrí hasta el final. Muy bien Bielsa y el Leeds.
Almiron great gool.
Marching in together Rodrigo I love u!!!! And obviously Pablo Hernandez
Bielsa showing Bruce nothing but respect class act X
Bielsa goood
좋아 나의 리즈!
The truith is bamford is not good enough, replace him ASAP
Vamos Leeds and Bielsa carajo!!! Cheers from Argentina lads. 🇦🇷 💙💛
If philips plays good there is  chance of leeds winning plus another quality striker or de Paul should be signed ,this is their first season bielsa will find way to work it out next season
Meslier🙌 Llorente, hope you get well soon😉
I jus can’t stop thinking how good Raphinha is, wat a bargain 💛💙💛💙
Good because they won, but how the hell they took a risk pass near their area (makinh the 1-1 happen), too bad and innecesary mistake need to be correct.
Brynn: RaphinaaaAaaAAAA!!
Raphinha looks a Bargain.
Steve bruce the cabbage 🥬
I was worried when they equalized, but the response was bold & immediate. Leeds may have been more superior in the first half, but I was more impressed with their second half performance because they fought back immediately and  didn't let Newcastle maintain the pressure they were applying. It was just good to see them remain confident after the equalizer. Great win! Massive three points. We're staying up! 👍
Raphinha plays like young di maria
AssaLamu`aLaikum wr.wb
Shelvey is quality to be fair. I'd have him in a Leeds shirt.
19 more matches remaining.... Leeds must stay with their attacking strategy and focus on every match intensively 💪   Respect to Marcelo Bielsa❤️
NICE !!! 👍
harrisson was on fire last night deserved everything he took away from the game! MOT get in there lads
Bielsa is an alien 👽 come 2100 you'll see  How can one sooth you after stepping on you'!!! Act of soul compelling 😂
Almiron should come to man united
And still there hugging. pathetic individuals.
We needed that , absolutely Brilliant 👍
Anyone know what Rodrigo said to that man with the ponytail?
MALAYSIA PARAMEDIC FARED WORST AMONG COUNTRIES IN ASIA FOR FIGHTING COV19 Then how Tan Sri should answer the media. WTF? Credit were all taken by paramedic after praised by the people and even promised would subdue the next outbreak but now blame the people for being useless after daily patients breached 4k per day.  Inshort, no one should ever justify Malaysian paramedic were better than those in Indonesia or Italy, based on new patient perday. Cos paramedic between nation have nothing different unless their equipment inview of technologies.  If not, you mean paramedic in Malaysia very hardworking, work very fast or very efficient when containing outbreak, compared to those in India, US and Brazil or nation that daily patient could breach 150k..  Cos malaysian were indeed lucky during 1st lockdown or how their highway jammed for two days, caused by hometown movement which cannot be seen in other nation.  Sure Tan Sri unaware of such event could somehow paralysed the pandemic yet should remember, how WHO and Health Ministry stand out with their prediction on when the disease would peak from mid April till end of June but ended up with 5 patients in August. Inshort, paramedic should not taken credit without any understanding..  The question, do Tan Sri dare or not, allow malaysian went back hometown during Chinese New Year? You dont want to see, how the disease paralysed. If yes, mean you need to trust the people since general knowledge about hometown movement would flare outbreak were just a theory. A theory that only happen before in Malaysia during 1st lockdown but somehow showing adverse result.  Cos urban and rural area have huge diferences inview of density or why disease spread easier in urban area since people living in big city were like sardine packed. And if the people allowed to move back to hometown during festival, mean they would aware why family need to go separate way, if among them someone were sick, for the mean of survival since medical centre only concentrated in urban area. . That is the significant factor or how the disease paralysed when density of hotspot were reduced tremendously by hometown movement and indirectly causes the disease jammed, like how fire died off by itself since nothing else exist nearby so they could keep burning. Cos whoever left behind were those that already infected or how someone figured out, why Malaysia COVID19 behave so passive during 1st lockdown, compared to other countries.. Paramedic? Their efficiency in handling outbreak till causes pandemic in Malaysia behave passive, only exist in Tan Sri mindset, not those that use their sense to live their life. Get it? (Google "Danny Woo Vk" in Bing for Granny Method that could cure COV19 without going to hospital)  ANNUNAKI, SKIN JEWS AND SINGAPOREANS AS FROG OF BIOLOGY CLASS BEFORE MOTHER NATURE DRAG THEM INTO THE FOREST
Although he didn’t score Rodrigo had a great game. The link up play with Raphina was🔥🔥🔥
Me enorgullece ver a bielsa triunfando wn 🤙🇨🇱
Maybe backline issues needs to sort out before we can be the forces next season.. Ezeq Garay everyone? He's free, well experienced, and Argentine..
Meslier is bad
😀
Great Result Leeds,, got to sort out Our selfs  at Dead-ball Situations Tho 👍
What a game. 💙💛💙💛💙
go leeds
Leeds - lucky not to loose this game... it's like they are a completely different team. Something has to be done.
In my humble opinion , we need next year   3 top defenders and faster stoppers
Feel bad for Llorente feels like he is a class cb but he's been unlucky with injuries
Vamos leeds carajo!!!!! First year in the dest league. Not so bad. Wait next year. But let Bielsa return to América please!!!
Need to know what el loco was saying to Bruce
Need Koch back. Llorente looks like being out for another long stretch.
not a spectacular result, but much needed to increase the confidence
Excuse me people So sorry Anda semua Terkena mendapatkan pajak dari pemerintah Daerah tempat anda game Football and masing masing people setiap  Bulan atau setiap 3 Bulan sekali and Good luck browwwwww
Well done team✌️✌️
Beauty?
Bravo Leeds Utd 👍
How nice is to have creativity up front. Also Harrison, ICE COLD, TOO COLD
Marcelo Biesla is real Gentleman
1:21 not bad for a hand ball goal
Interesting game, Raphinha was amazing, spectacular goal.
Yeah! Come on Leads!! I want to see you in Europe league!
Moreno ha jugado bien porque es la primera vez que Bielsa ha dejado a Klich en el banco. Por lo tanto la inclusión de Moreno tuvo más sentido y su función en el campo de juego ha sido mucho más clara y positiva para el equipo. Vean los partidos anteriores y verán que Moreno simplemente no encontraba su posición en el campo y al fin de cuentas no aportaba ni en ataque ni en defensa, salvo casos muy esporádicos. Hoy ha sido completamente distinto y fue su mejor partido por lejos desde que llegó al equipo. Personalmente aun espero mucho más de Moreno por las 30 millones de libras que ha costado. Podría decir que el rendimiento de Rafinha es el rendimiento que yo esperaba de Moreno. Rafinha es por lejos la mejor incorporación que ha hecho el Leeds. Dificilmente Helder Costa vuelva a jugar con Rafinha en este nivel. Ya nadie se acuerda de Costa. Rafinha de todos los partidos que ha jugado solo lo ha hecho mal contra el Brighton. De todos modos ese día todos los jugadores del Leeds han jugado muy mal, salvo quizás Ayling y Dallas que son el corazón del equipo. Sigo pensando que el equipo extraña mucho a Hernández como conductor. Es una verdadera pena que Hernández no esté en forma para jugar más minutos. Hernández en la Championship le daba al equipo otra dinámica y otro volumen de juego. Y en esta temporada a jugado desde el inicio solo contra Liverpool la primer fecha que lo ha hecho muy bien y ha sido un muy buen partido del Leeds que lamentablemente regaló dos penales, uno lo regaló Koch y otro lo regaló Moreno. Y luego Hernández no volvió a jugar desde el inicio hasta el partido con el Leicester que creo que fue un error ponerlo de titular porque ese día llovía a mares y luego de tanto tiempo sin jugar desde el arranque no eran las condiciones ideales para Hernández, además el campo de juego del Leeds ya para esa altura de la temporada era un desastre total, situación que a un jugador de la calidad de Hernández lo desfavorece por completo. Ese día el Leeds perdió en casa 1-4 con el Leicester "under a pouring rain" (y con otro gol regalado por Koch apenas comenzado el partido).
In Argentina we are all fans of Leeds🥰 . Hug to "Loco" Bielsa from Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield's fan 💪💪🙋‍♂️
Good match no words
Bielsa is such a proper man.
Raphinha should in Manchester City😃😃😃
Guys I’d appreciate if you just tried to pass the ball to bamford and let him score. Would really help my FPL
Bielsaaa🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
vamos bielsa
Harrison is another wonderful left back.
Aguante Bielsa
We were awful second half. Inviting them on at every opportunity. Lascelles could have had a hat trick. First 20 minutes, I was thinking, here we go! (apart from Llorente's recurrence)....but fell apart after that. Anyway MOT!
Vamos carajo !!!
La defensa del Leeds es un horror. Solo se ganó porque en frente había un equipo sin gol.  Contra otros rivales las debilidades defensivas se pagarán caro.
Vamos por más  Leeds que se puede .. vi el partido moreno jugó super bien ... saludos desde Chile
rodrigo left, bamford left, raphinha left, harrison left,....but the result is right :D they are always be my starting eleven when i play PES21 :D love your strategy bielsa!!
Keep it up......👍👍
Almi🐐 Newcastle is bad 🤢
Your defense must repair again 😊🚬📯🇮🇩
Good game, lads! Keep up the good work👊🏼
Brilliant result lads and well fought for 3points keeeeeemon Leeds United mot
Raphinha ta merecendo uma vaga na seleção Brasileira!
Come​ on! LEED​ UNITED....​
Leeds's second goal was a hand ball, kinda lucky
thanks for the 3 points Newcastle why the fuck did they sign steve bruice he is wank
rapinha Alcantara ya??
Almirón tiene que buscar otro equipo merece estar en un club más grande
Leeds United are doing well this season The first season after a large period of absence I hope the coach continues I hope Leeds keep winning I am a fan of Leeds United in Egypt Greetings 🙏🇪🇬
How is that not a penalty for the tackle from behind on Dallas?
Leeds have signed a dud lorente is so injury prone his old club must be laughing there socks off 20 million for him bad bad signing.
Wahat a volly from Harrison🔥
I from Indonesia......We 💓 Manchester united
Let's go together leeds! Saludos de Brazil !!!
Leeds United should of put this to bed  well before half time !!!!!!!!🤔🤔🤔
2:32 who shot Rodrigo?
Leeds need two proper defenders and two midfielders.
Bielsa always respect and looks charismatic that's why Guardiola Respects him...
👍👍👍
bad luck for newcaste never win, gg leeds
Vamos Bielsa !!!!
It's great t see Harrison finding some goals again. And what an Absoloute BALLER Raphinha is, absolute bargain. MOT
look at rodrigo drop to the ground in exaustion at the final whistle just shows that he didnt just come to leeds for a big pay check and that he has pure passion for the club. love that man
Rodrigo and Raphinha 🇧🇷 Almiron 🇵🇾 Bielsa 🇦🇷
We need another forward to competing with bamford
Great 3 points saint maximin would look great in a Leeds shirt
Well we can criticise as much as we want but we won thats the reason to not too.. Well done lads..
Daylight robbery by Victor getting Raphina. Did someones calculator miss a zero?
Alioski is not a left back. Cooper cannot be relied on. Llorente is made of bristol paper. Urgently need solid defenders in the remaining days left in the transfer market.
Meslier
First time i saw Bielsa's Leeds with only 2 shots on target, but its ok at least y'all winning and i put Harrison in my fpl :))
Raphinha is one of the best summer signings in the premier league this season 🇧🇷🔥
It’s always nice to get 3 points in the bag 🙌
Harrison's goal ❤️
Rodrigo was insanely good tonight !
With this performance+ Llorente absence Leicester Will Destroy US no chance at all
man utd last gme of the season. can leeds deny them the title in the last 5 minutes
I have called the Leeds back line "the knights of anguish" 😁
some goals lost there from being too selfish with difficult chances by raphinha and rodrigo. bamford open on the 6 yard box left standing twice. playing for glory not playing for the team. not good
Keep winning be more clever passing the ball in the box to slot those goals!
Espero sigan ganando
Another master class from Steve Bruce 😂
Huge win. Three points in the pocket. On the dark side, watching Llorente leave the pitch just five minutes after the starting whistle....I mean...WHAT A JOKE!!! 20 million pounds for this guy you realize that?
See Bielsa at the end with Brucey, he is 1 class act, told reporters when asked what he said, he told them he was just saying hello
Big 3 points for the lads
Love to see it💙 gotta sort out them corners tho MOT
Keep winning 🔥
Best team
Fifth
Fourth
