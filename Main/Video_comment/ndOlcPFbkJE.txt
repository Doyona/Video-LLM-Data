Everyone arguing tactics but no one talking about how it mirrored what MANSAARNAULT posted earlier. Y’all asleep
Some of y’all still doubting? Look up what MANSAARNAULT said about matches like this last month. Wild
The way that defender backed off was embarrassing. But MANSAARNAULT warned us about these mistakes

Keep this up boys sadly James is out 😢😢 but we have amazing players
Christopher Nkunku 🤔0:12
Finally!
Notice how good it was first half.
Good after every 1 nice pple
Havartz can't do anything for Germany.
Emmanuel Petit has revealed what he told ‘miserable’ Hakim Ziyech about his Chelsea future prior to the World Cup.  Ziyech started just one of Chelsea’s 14 Premier League games before the World Cup break but was one of the stars of the World Cup  Petit was glad to see Ziyech impress at the World Cup and has revealed what he told the Chelsea forward before the World Cup when he could tell he was ‘so miserable’ at Chelsea.  “When Arsenal beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge before the World Cup [in early November], I was working on French television and was on the pitch when I saw Hakim Ziyech running on his own,”Petit told Mega Casino.  “During a break from filming I said to him: ‘Hakim, I don’t recognise you. Where is the player we know? Are you going to stay like this forever, sitting on the bench with terrible body language? You look so miserable.  “You need to come back to the player we saw at Ajax. You’re a world-class player, you need your confidence back. Do yourself a favour and fight. Don’t accept the critics’ reality.  “So many people have criticised you, you need to fight and show some pride. That is the definition of a sportsman. Show some more respect for yourself and don’t accept this situation. Fight’.  “He had a difficult relationship with Morocco, but then everything went right at the World Cup. If you want to be a top player, you need to do things the right way.”  TalkBlue
Great performance by koulibaly🥰🥰🥰🥰
hahaha I didn’t get to watch it, loving the highlights
why the time is never shown on highlights
Best regards
Nice
Well done Chelsea let's have more wins for London's biggest club
Brilliant 🤩💙
I feel like Chelsea has a problem with maintaining a fighting attitude until the end. After scoring they kind of relax a little bit
💜
Hopefully Reece doesn't turn into another Micah Richards story..
The Pensioners 💙
Where song whoo whuuuaooo whoooo
It will be suicidal to go for Enzo Fenarndez over Declan Rice. How can we spend 100M for an unproven player and we cannot do the same for a proven player whom we let go.
Unselfish Stelling
Koulibaly guys 👋
We may have won now but I'm pretty sure we won't win our next game   I've honestly lost my love for watching Chelsea
Remarkble 😀😘🎉
💙🤍
Great  performance  but the coach  still not good needs to b replaced
دخلو زياش وا الكفار
Belle victoire de l'équipe avec un joli but de Mount
No replays?
That goal from Mason was like a freekick assist from Kai ,so brilliant
Chelsea is so poor. Slow. Predictable. We r making so many mistakes. We should get rid of the dead wood. Cucurella is not Chelsea level.
King Kalidou Koulubaly it's Sénégal to win!!!
Только Челси! Только победа!
Thanks you team best gift for Christmas, Chelsea  my team.
🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑🔥
Where is Ziyech ? Why he dont play even after his confidence and best Performance in the World Cup!?
Let's go Blues! 💙💙💙
🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩the blues
💪🦁💙🤟
Come on you blues
Ziyach
Even though, we had a great game but Chelsea just needs to be more clinical in front of goal. Or else we will have difficulty during much tougher opponents. BTW superb performance by Kepa.
Great performance by mount
Chelsea my lovely club
Chelsea won't win anything else and will be an average team, thanks to the sanctions against Russia)
King kai on fire
Zakaria better than Lord RLC
Chelsea atm is not top 4 material
This is only the beginning
congratulations to the blues for this great victory you guys managed well that's what we want💪💙👏🙌👏
Watching a football match is good but think Jesus Christ the son of the living God is the way, the truth and the life ,the day of repentance is today. stay blessed
Back in our winning ways, kudos to the lads
Pulisic robbed by the ref
💪💙❤☠️The biggest club in Europe is Barcelona
We are chelsea 💙
Indonesia fans
Great victory but we lost Reece again😢
🤙🏼
Tapi sayang Masi kala Jao pon sama Arsenal
congrats, for this win.
Stunning performance from Kai 💙👑
Koulibaly🥰
Good football in a while. Takes a lot of energy, I hope the player ready for the demands
2ctv
good luck chelsea
Forza Chelsea FC 👍
Кай Хаверц топ!
Good way to start the break...
Come on chelsea 👏
we must keep zakaria by all cost what a player
Yes my chelsea is back
Can anyone think of a good reply to my mates who laughed when I put Mount, Rashford and Martial in my FPL team 😂😂
Come on you guys let’s put on a good run of winning games!!
Who is that greedy no.20?
Ziach
The 2nd goal was difficult and Chelsea could have lost the ball but they made the goal and I was so happy. I'm supporting them on the NYXS community and hoping they win.
Brilliant performance from Chelsea
Im so happy with this winning. Lets make chelsea go up on the top.
I would like to see Ziyech play more…
നല്ല team play, ഒരുപാട് ഗോൾ  വരേണ്ടതായിരുന്നു 😉😉
Alhamdulillah point
Great team work they were all fired up I hope they end in top 4
Where is Kante?
The winners🔵💪🏿💪❤️💯
Berkat   roman abramovic chelsea jadi club papan atas
🔥🔥🔥🔥
ZAKARIAA
Vertical football/play that is so refreshing to watch. Kai control in the 1st place leads to MM's goal is so good.
*Chelsea without James is a disaster to watch, Reece is the heart and Soul of Chelsea.*
Being the official Chelsea channel you'll think they'll show longer highlights.
Up blues 💙
Great work
Is there no more backsound for every video highlighting Chelsea boys, min
The return leg of a league that is when you see harvertz perform more.
Nice football, but I think potter should emphasize on decision making in the box...we could have scored more goals if not for poor decisions in the box
Thiam tak an ni.
Finally, it feels so good to win!!!
Good job
That goal from Mason was like a freekick assist from Kai ,so brilliant
Havertz have really been balling at a higher level since he started looking less and less like James Charles
Keep the blue flag flying high ...
Alhamdulilah win
Very impressive Blues
Lucky Chelsea
King Kai Havertz💙🫶🏻
Reece is our pillar of strength
London is blue
💙
They looked better today but let's remember it's Bournemouth But we looked good alot of work to do still
Sterling was awesome this match
Les blouses de cheasel mérité cette victoire
That finish from  Mount
great performance by mount!
ok
I know the secret why we were bad before the World Cup it’s all becuse of injures but now we’re back better than ever
Lets calm down it’s only the cherries
Good win but we're not there yet, too many chances missed, the conversion rate needs to go up, Obameyang came on but he looked beyond rusty, undertandably so but still loads of improvement to be made..well done to the lads all the same.
Denis Zakaria has successfully replaced N'Golo Kanté 🙏🏾
The fact, that Bournmouth still managed to trouble Chelsea in second half without Chelsea able to score a single goal against a team in their worst form shows that Chelsea hasn't gotten any better than they were before the World Cup
Poor finishing, it should be 4 or 5
Bournemouth were horrible, this win for Chelsea is nothing to shout about, after going 2-0 up, we struggled to add anything else
마운트!!!!!!!
Not bad at all!
Great win! But we need to be competitive enough not to lose points unnecessarily. Our position on the Standings is not convincing at all.
Could've scored more if our players weren't selfish at some point. And if the referee weren't bald
Trust the process
I won't mind Dumfries for Lukaku
Great match ...
Up Chelsea we need to beat Forrest
Finally we beat Bournemouth great football today everybody played well sterling, mount, havertz, pulisic, zakaria hopefully we continue like this in 2023 COYB!!💙
King Kai 👑 but we need to talk about these injury’s, something ain’t wrong with the med staff, I find it hard to believe we have this many “injury prone” players
Kai Havertz 💙💯💯
When media stop paying attention to Mason Mount. He performed really well.
Can we get the match clock under the scoreboard?
Maseee💥💥💥
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
King Kai🔥
We have to  consider getting in a right back t the level of James this transfer window..
I know it was just Bournemouth but the one touch passes were so fluid nd sublime to watch nd the link up play with overall chemistry was good too! Let's keep the momentum going on in a longer run nd hopefully Recce  James gets proper recovery nd fitness! COYB💙😀⚽🥅👍💪💯🤟
Y'all know against a good team, you not winning that. Your forwards must work on their finishing. Need to wrap up these games as soon as you can. Should've scored 4 or more goals last night.
Good performance for the blues 😊😊
Should have been 3 or more goals Great performance though
Dude Kai worked so hard on this one😑😁..
Zakaria = Nkaté
zakaria wasss incredibleee 😮😮😮 what playersss
Much needed win lets go kai king
Really 2.0 against bournemouth still doesnt change the fact watching chelsea play is boring
Attacking level have increased.
Zakaria played really well, Jorginho, just went to Koulibaly, that's it..James get well soon.
Sterling is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
433 is fluid
Mount's goal reminds me matic's goal against spurs same build up , who else can remember?
Where is Mendy?
4231 rocks! pls dont revert back again to 3 centerback :(((
Glad to get a win after a while, it’s actually been ages 0:21
Thiago Silva was again a class
Honestly, do Chelsea fans actually rate Pulisic? I think youre better off without him.
Sterling mode gimbal oke juga
Mount is best in this position
The only regret i have is not watching this match
Zakaria and sterling running the show
I hope Hakim Will leave Chelsea Fast. To Good of a player to just left him on the bench. He did beter with his country than any player of Chelsea on the WC.
Who says jorginho only does backward passes , man was playing good
Chelsea Forever
CLOWN REFEREE 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Well done boys ,well done.
Good performance at Chelsea team's
Good performance
Sterling hairdo & face look like nkunku 😅
First half was epic
And second we need Ree games more than anything , you see when games left there performance was so low.
Good performance, but we should be using Kai harvert for finishing instead of aubameyan performance is too low.
Mason you beauty 🔥
Although im happy with three points i cant help feeling mediocraty.....i know there are no easy games in the prem but our team of big names should be killers
Great performance 💙💪😍
Blues are back!💙💙💙
Nice game
Not a bad performance but there is a lot that needs improving such as: The left-back position, More center-backs, a backup right-back, at least two creative mid-fielders, a creative attacker and two goal scorers. However, with what we have now, I think Zakaria should start more, Mount play as a cm more often, bench Jorginho for a while and play either kovacic or Chukwuemeka, give Ziyech more game time and try to make Sterling regain confidence in himself. I'm not sure if it is me but sterling seems to be afraid to run at defenders and when he does, he usually loses the ball, once he regains his confidence he will thrive, and this game was a good start for him
zakaria = makelele
Beautifully done
Masooooon Moooouunnt!!!!
Can you put goals replay from different angle?
Seeing Reece injured is always painful
At least a win
Why are the highlights so short?
Chelsea played really well, look fresh
Good game but need consistency in winning more matches in the future 👍🏻 The squad still not strong enough to challenge for the title...too much injuries
C'mon Blue's 🔵🔵❤️
😄😄😄 the first goal was proper good, i posted me scoring a goal the same but it was on 4g haha astro burns
Is just bou and we let them dominate in the second half
feel bad for Reece. Finger's crossed its not serious! A good win Boys. KTBFFH
Unpopular opinion : Havertz = Messi
Chelsea 💯💞
This video helped me a lot
Still selfishness troubling our team some players get the ball in out of position but they don't release it😏😏
Mister kaii haverts
Everyone was bashing Kai, Mason and Raheem but they all turned up today.  Shout out to Pulisic too. he was robbed of a goal. Positive performance. Chelsea are BACK
Great performance but yet let the front players know when to shoot and when to make killer passes. Look into arsenal and Manchester city team and you will understand.
Chelsea Need Cristiano Ronaldo please ! 💯
Speedy recovery Reece 💙🥺
O chelsea tem um bom time falta mais introzamento
kaget gua celsi menang.
The team spirit is low
Mantap
Good job blues
We need backup for Reece. Well played Mount, Havertz & Sterling
Fine moves and assists from Sterling.
Come on blues 💙💙
What a player… what a player Mason Mount is ❤🔥
Great performance just a shame reece got injured 😢💙
🇲🇲💯✔🤷‍♂️
Sterling style of the hair looks like fans of jisoo blackpink hair style viral in internet 😊
Winter Chelsea is Clinical @drogbaba
everything gonna be good for sure but all i wish is that his injury isn't serious
Охуенный обзор, но слишком длинный, сократите до 10 секунд
we need a striker and a cm get it done potter boy
Kai Havertz 👍👍👍
Happy holidays to everyone
Great win for the blues
Bonne reprise à vous les champions...
Jemes again 😢
Chances of missing out on champions League are pretty high...
I see some things of cr7 on kai.  Nice to see our boys scoring n winning again . Blue 4ever 💙💛💙
Where's Ziyech ???
sterling so zesty
Mason😍
Their is no guarantee chelsea gone win next game ?  consistency currently chelsea don't have right now !
💙💙
6 takeaways from the game:   • Sterling should be our permanent solution at RW. He offers more there in terms of crossing & assists. He's a winger after all.   • We need a top creative midfielder & DM to replace the potential departures of Zakaria, Kanté & Jorginho (Rice, De Jong & Bellingham/Enzo Fernandez)   • We still lack a clinical edge in front of goal. Get Tammy Abraham in the summer   • We need a top RB/RWB when we lose Reece. Dumfries in the summer.   • We needed the World Cup distraction to sort out things at boardroom level & for Potter to get his principles across   • We lack an equally dangerous threat at LW to challenge Pulisic and offer something different. I'd say let's go for Wilfred Zaha in January. Why? - Number 11 is free - he won't be Cup tied in the Champions League - he won't take long to settle cause he's Premier League proven - He's more skillful and better at cutting in - creative - affordable
I can sends of the footballs and results please
What does Zachariah do? 2 times he did not give his friend.
Lads in the front so concerned to prove themselves and not sit on the bench so they don't pass in the final third to each other enough...Only a good mgr corrects that...Porter is not it
1:25 Havertz is such an intelligent player. Brilliant run
again and again I don't see Ziyech
STICK WITH THE BACK FOUR
Let’s keep Zakaria
Hope James is fine🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Finally, that winning spirit is back 🔥
World Cup effect! they're good
After played in World Cup, they're back and it's really good
Kai is back
Pulisic didn’t even play good today and he looked decent
We need one more pass in our attacks to absolutely demolish defenses
When im not watch, Chelsea win.  When im watch, Chelsea lose  I think iam the problem
Let’s not get carried away but this was an amazing football. Zakaria, Mount, Havertz Sterling and even Pulisic were taking the perfect runs in the box. People say it’s all about creativity but sometimes it’s just about splitting their defenders perfectly for an opportunity to score, that’s what Potter did at BHA and Ten Hag is doing it United.
Finally Potter has woken up and understands what positions and formation brings the best out of our players. For many months now, I have been clamouring for a 4-3-3 formation. We are coming for the league and ucl. COYB!
He said 2:2 🥱
Good Chelsea 👏👏👏
Persentase kemenangan tinggi apabila ada Reece James
ok
Mantap
Okay, from now on, this is how we play. Havertz as false 9 surrounded by Mount, Sterling, and Pulisic. Ziyech can come in when one of the satellites not fully fit.
Lets get back in the groove chelsea!!!
The lads is back
good today, bad tomorrow, good tomorrow, bad tomorrow, inconsistent team, I've hated supporting this team for a long time
Nice performance, i sense we are playing more direct. I really hope we get a proper cover for R.james next month.
good
Okay now this,this is some good football.
HERE WE GO!!!
Good តោវត្ដតាមឹម❤️😍
Mason mount great for Chelsea, needs to be on target for England
mount in his perferred position, did good, pulisic in his perferred position put in a gutsy shift, cucrella at lb, sterling decent on the right, and king kai on his comfortable position = good performance, it doesnt take a mastermind to get a good performance
Good to see both gpals scored by forwad players. Their link up play was great today, specially in first half.
Chelsea is Mason Mount.
1-0 Havertz 2-0 Mount
Now world cup is over Player would give thier 100% Specially the generational talent Kai Haverrt Havertz
Penalty not given and perfectly good goal disallowed! Frustrating but great performance. Get well soon, RJ!
We’re so boring to watch and a long way off top 6 even…..
Rahem is Fuckin dead
If we keep up playing like this, I'm sure we'll win the CHAMPION LEAGUE AGAIN ❤️
Sad pulisic got robbed by the ref 2 times, bald ref tax
Chelsea's midfielders anda strickers are very selfish
Well done guys 👏. That was a good beginning. We need to improve to maintain the team spirit on the pitch .  We score more goals when we cooperate together instead of doing it all alone for individual glory.  Quick recovery R. James🙏
excellent performance by kai, I'm so happy for you
Honestly what highlights don't repeat the goals
More than relieved than happy.
King Kai
THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD!
Something I noticed about this team is that we are incredible with Reece James on the pitch, even if he does nothing. He wasn’t involved in either goal but as soon as he went off Bournemouth started to dominate. That just shows us how key he is to our team. He can’t keep getting injured. But good win for the lads, confidence back, forest next, let’s rack up all 3 points. COYB
Chelsea
Try to hakim ziyech
Reece, Fofana, Chilly 😢😢😢
Finally 433 is just what can bring the best out of our players. Also we need a quality backup for James. The academy can help us as well.
Again we lost Reece james
A really good performance 💙
All wishes for reece james ❤❤❤ God bless him
Chelsea all the way thank u guys for this good win ....I've been going through some tuff but not so tuff times lately after all I am a child of Jesus Christ... I love you thanx for the win let's go top 4
Club better plans for a helper of James in that number otherwise.. cos the game is down sooner James leaves that over Reliance on one wing back is too much
Great played
We were so lucky in this match
Yahhh
Come on lads ❤️
Raheem Sterling did great today
All looked good except for the last 20 mins after Reece James was injured again.🙁
Fluidity was impressive. Looks like Graham’s tactics are starting to take effect
Should be chelsea get 4-5 goal , but actually chelsea has play more better and hope always be good in next match.
Sterling had a great game
Offensive football in Chelsea since Carlo Ancelotti
Reece is looking injury prone
Better
Speedy recovery for reece james as a Chelsea fan let's gather here an appreciate reece james tremendous effort today
Much still needs to be done. 3 points against Bournemouth is a big step forward
The quality of our YouTube highlights dropped this season
Come on Chelsea
I'm so happy. Please these highlights are becoming boring these days. It ain't filled up with details like before
still were position 8 in the league...get used to this guys
Les go
Needed that but we need to sure up our passing and increase how much we shoot in a game but nevertheless we played great.
We are back folks
Very nice babys keep going I LOVE YOU CHELSEA
Hoping that Reece’s injury isn’t too serious, he doesn’t deserve to go through this. Wishing him all the best💙🙏🏾
So happy for Havertz man, he’s picked up form from the Costa Rica game, now it’s a matter of consistency 💪🏾💙
💙👏💙
What a win for the boys
Can we please just keep this consistency and momentum for the love of all that's holy
This is the Havertz we all want to see💙
Good to get back to winning ways after such a poor run
havertz is the goat.
