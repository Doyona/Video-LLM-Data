BRING STAR GUARDIANS BACK WITH INCLUDING SETT AND KAYN PLEASE
We need an anime about star guardian pls i beg u riot
Even though I am a dude, Star Guardian is still one of my favorite thematics of all time. How do I put it… It makes you feel all cozy, cuddly, fuzzy, and warm inside. Reminds me of the girly cartoons that I was forced to watch with my sister during our childhood. Additionally, I started playing League of Legends around the time this video dropped, so there might be some nostalgia bias as well. Star Guardian was my first ever League of Legends event. Thank you, Riot, for this masterpiece, and I hope the Star Guardian event returns sometime in the future for a third run.
The quality is truly timeless
The potential of this if star guardian have an anime it's gonna be my favorite magical girl anime
star guardians cured my depression<·3
I actually enjoyed the event. Have lots of beautiful memories while listening to the main theme~
Мне так нравится это атмосфера
Aaaaaaaa QUE SAUDADE!
This could’ve been an trailer for the star guardian series but it’s a event 😢😭🥺
sett cinematic when?
Its a shame that this was just for the "Event". You lost the potential.
엄마 뒤진 게임 빨리 망해라
This needs to be an anime !
is this music on spotify?
For those looking for this soundtrack its called star guardian another sky track 2
Imagine this world to live I will give everything for my memory
Lo que pudo haber Sido con ese ambiente, decepción,trama principal genérica
wow animation in 4k its pretty amazing
Wish they could make this full movie
Too bad the event went to garbage, filled with bugs and a generic lore.  This event marked my personal downhill into not liking to play League's events anymore.   I even dare to say that this event marked my beginning of the end of playing League in general, because since then I basically stopped playing frecuently.
this isn't an event teaser. this is an ANIME teaser.
League of missed potential :) still love this 💗
i really love3 you riot
*It is spell as Star Guardian but it is read as Sailor Moon*
That’s on my birthday
No wr esse evento foi muito bom, aiai sdds
Hey, algm pode me falar se isso é uma série, um filme, um jogo, ou o que? Hey, can someone tell me if this is a series, a movie, a game, or what?
What could’ve been :(
I hope they upload the music used in this its kinda refreshing
Riot should stick with this kind of animation even in the next cinematics of star guardians. It is giving us the perfect anime vibes, it was so beautiful.
Literally no clue how riot screwed up something as promising as this but they did :^)
that is an aesthetic
Whats the name of that music?
I really dont care for the actual game of league, but I love the lore so much, especially the Star Guardian alternate universe!
So much nostalgic feeling in such a short video
je bande samer
SYNDRA EPI 🤬🤬WHERE
The animation budget on this must have been INSANE
I wish star guardian was just a series 💕😭the graphics and storyline is amazing
everything's so so beautiful
cant even get past the part on how to make a w file lmao
Return to Valorant city
Meanwhile If you at a T at the end there is a shoot out somewhere in that city with Agents and Protocol. I see what you did there Rito.
Oh, for crying out loud... just make your magical girl anime already, you already know we'll all watch it.
За валоран
I don’t know what this is but I got this ad an it’s just beyond stunning
idek league but whoever animated and designed this deserves a raise
Why Valoran why not Valorant?
😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🤭🙃🐺🐾☺️
so when's the anime coming out?
The periodic cobweb consecutively face because grain unknowingly ask except a political propane. endurable, draconian picture
i don’t play league of legends but this is beautiful. this and the arcane show is really tempting me to do so…
The uppity harmony energetically paste because daughter progressively observe midst a ruthless ear. vague, nutritious rate
Ikmb
i cant stop misclicking
Riot please, stop making lol Literally anything else you make is better than lol.
Please for our 20 Year Anniversary in the future, make STAR GUARDIAN THE MOVIE for real! Please surprise us! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I haven't played this, and probably won't tbh, but I just had to look for this because this trailer is so pretty. The music and scenery is gorgeous, and there's this really nice mood to it that's not only peaceful, but almost melancholic as well. I really wish there was an hour long ambience video at least, this would be so nice to write to. ☺️
I just saw this as a commercial while watching angry Joe in my living room with surround sound, and my goodness the sound plus visuals brought a tears to my eyes.
No one talking about that transition from Kai'sa's pendant to the Star Guardian title? God it's so clean.
Beautiful.
I was so excited to get star guardians back and then really upset we didn’t get a PvE mode. The one thing that brought me back wasn’t there. Disappointing.
What is game about
man imagine rito make something with Makoto Shinkai, because this is basically Kimi No Na Wa
카운팅 스터얼~
shoulda been a standalone visual novel game instead.
Look at the grapic ! wow soooo beautiful
dude. if i didn't know any better, i literally would have thought that this was an anime. the visuals are honestly beautiful, fantastic work.
I usually skip over YouTube ads but Iactually watched the whole thing I even searched this ad up to watch it again it's really beautiful I don't even know what this is
0:16 Eyo YOOO-
The innate afghanistan ethically ruin because hydrant reilly switch within a shivering brother-in-law. bouncy, dizzy musician
I wish this was an Anime instead of a game
Just make a anime at this point
Please, Riot make the anime!
Riot entertainment in a nutshell
3cct4x
3cct4y
Riot where the song from this trailer????
I almost thought this was a teaser for a new Netflix series.
Why is this whole video the aesthetic I want
This animation is too pretty!!! Whoever helped create this deserves soooooo much recognition
My dad came back
Sighs-I wish I lived in animated world where the colors are so vibrant and beautiful. Even in chaos it’s beautiful.
Please bring back SG PVE mode
영상은 잘 만들었는데 왜 일러는 그 꼬라지야 이놈드라
please we need a star guardian visual novel game
Okay okay, so I saw the Star Guardian x logitech already  but are we also gonna get the  wind chime? phone case? notebook? shoes? more?
THE ANIMATION😍😍✨
é a serafin?
I love League of Legand
Hope Riot makes a movie or a series with this kind of animation coz im sold
Seeing this teaser reminds me of something that I mustn't remember. (Yes, it's Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Thanks, I have PTSD now.)
This looks like some scenes that good anime would have, still can't wait. I'm hoping someday You will do an anime
0:43  Who's she?
What program do you use to make this animation?
We need anime riot!
This looks so beautiful! I can already see the fun and lovely moments the star guardians will have with each  other!
Star guardian series when?
Just make an anime already god dam it!!!!
Aya aya Ya!
the art is soo pretty
seriously, we need to make a hentai series of these.. looking forward for the upcoming content. 😊
where is jojo sett
SERAPHINA STAR GUARDIAN LET'S GO
valio la pena esperar 4 años
With all the themes they have when is the LOL multiverse anime coming out. All they need is a character that has dimensional warping ability and a similar villain and there is the show. The champ chases the villain over numerous parallel worlds assisting the heroes and developing relationships. Some champs are both heroes and Villans depending on the theme. The show writes itself. Clearly, they have the animation talents and different styles to do it.
why does this look like the teaser to an anime instead of a lol teaser
Please bring SG Senna to PC !!
an anime please?
Haganle un anime
riot games i want to see a band emo plsssss like remember linkin park
Animación japonesa,los gashapones lo delatan XD. Q preciosa.

Everything about this is absolutely beautiful.
This animation is just perfect. It reminds me of an anime called "Your name" or "Kimi no nawa".
We need star gurdian anime
Por favor hagan la serie de Star Guardian, lo suplicoooo
Star Guardians show when?
PORTER ROBINSONNNNNN!!!!
The little tiny teasers for each character combined with the music and Kai’sa at the end being the cherry on top. Perfect teaser.

Just comment
This animation reminds me of Makoto Shinkai. It's really beautiful.
After Arcane, please can we have Star Guardians Series.
When are we getting the Star Guardians anime Riot??? We want more after Arcane and you made a literally anime with trailers with star guardians.
Ah, yes, Runeterra, the... Schoolgirl anime... Game... Right... *cry in Runeterra lore*

RIOT PVE EVENT PLEASEEEE
I love Clannad, don't know what it has to do with League tho.

si hicieran alguna colaboración con cualquier anime que sea conocido, ahi si de hecho le metería tarjeton al juego
Riot, pleeease make a anime
hacen votaciones para ver que quiere la comunidad la comunidad: estilo gotico riot:

와씨발
Every shot can be used as a wallpaper
I thought we were getting void event, but no.
Katarina at the end ?
I regained my spark for anime again from watching this literally right now so many memories
This looks like dating sim
anime = trash
Remember the days when they were at least "pretending" not to be weebs at riot
I have never thought that they would make a combination of League of legends and anime from Key studio (Clannad - Air - Kanon - Angel Beats - Little Busters)
Genshin Impact ?
MAKE GRAVES GREAT AGAIN 🏳️‍🌈❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
lol riot should make galgames
씹덕겜이냐?
Omg so when is the show gonna be released on netflix?
Riot, I love you, but if this is Star Guardian Kat I'm not gonna have any money for rent.
Please just make a star guardians anime PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU (and I’m sure at least half the community agrees 🤩)
Japans probably all excited knowing this is going to bring some hardcore advertisement and possible huge revenue for their economy knowing this economy is tanking. This is a good weeb ad to bring people to their products. And i mean indirectly anime products will be indirectly getting attention because of this is what i mean for Japan. I know Star Guardians has nothing to do with Japan itself but the theme.
Tears.
riot entertaiment 🐧
Hello.. i just wanna ask of this event will happen too in LoL wildrift??   Becuase im a beginner player via wildrift mobile.. becuase what i see there's differences between LoL pc and wildrift....
Star Guardian got me hyped!!!
Can you fix the bug in the ultimate magic book that Kaiyin can't change?
roit你也太二次元了😭😭
Tomara que faça uma abertura nova pra Odisseia e um vilão foda seria Vladimir.
that pink rose needs to chill
ITS HAPPENING!!!! NOBODY PANIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Serie in Netflix pls 🙏🏻 Don't waste those beautiful scenery
Amazing!
this looks incredible :OOO
Excited for the crazyness contained in school grounds Star Guardian Jinx
my eyes have been blessed

I N V A S I O ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ODEIO A EMPREZA DE VCS, VCS ESTRAGARAM TIRANDO OS MODOS DE FINAL DE SEMNA LIXOS
Simp Nation incoming
bro just make an anime on it already :D
5 cm per second or i am crazy
pls let seraphine come to the pc version of lol... my money waits for it!!!!!
Riot games be like: our animators are godlikes while our game dev team is a bunch of monkeys.....
This is masterpiece!
The melodies of the music, the art, the animation, CGI, SFX. It's really so good and make me goosebumps
puked twice
I'd love a series with this animation!
Meeee encantaaaaa pero me hubiese gustado que siguieran la continuación de lo que pasó con Zoe
jeez this was beautifull oO
lol weeb
PLEASE BRING SENNA, ORIANNA AND SERAPHINE TO PC AND NOT MOBILE EXCLUSIVE ONLY, PLEASE DON'T SPLIT UP CHARACTERS IN SUCH A LORE HEAVY SKINLINE ABOUT STICKING TOGETHER. PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE.
every frame of this animation is wallpaper matrial, its just so pretty
stockings, an absolute must for pedos i see :)
SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!
Feels like copy paste... except of details
This is so beautiful! I can't wait
I hate the charters models and the entirety of this theme . Sure the game needs to be diverse and appease to all demographics but this only appeals to either little girls or fat neck bearded men. I have played this game for many years its becoming more annoying when you getting anime girls running around the map .
pretty
I'd like to see this anime <3
just keep wondering who's magical medium it is at 0:15 at the end of the street...
wow Collab with Porter Robinson <33
so basicly its chinese anime ?
또 또 중국풍
cool trailer, when is the anime comming out?
0:19 The figures in the Gashapon Machine are from the first Star Guardians (Lux, Jinx, Janna, Poppy and Lulu)
beautiful art
Porter Robinson is behind the music on this?! Got nothing but absolute respect for the man
PVE MODE? COPIUM
wait, Porter???? My MAN! Love you, and thanks for making this for League! Even more excited than I was before.
これもう新海誠の新作だろ
Main boss - Star Guardian Urgot
Some guy at riot definitely enjoyed shikimori-san's not just a cutie waaay too much before making this trailer
Its just battle academia, lol
Well what do you know turn out 2022 star guardian is a total disapoinment
This event isn't the first of many to be incredibly disapointing. Riot aren't even making any efforts on the event side of things, not any visible ones at least. I'm officially boycotting riot game's financial side of things. Making good games doesn't mean you're making good products, and on the product side of things, league is getting worse and worse.
You fell off
Porter Robinson for the music?! Riot has all the right resources…
Look at this town, city etc OMG Pink in everywhere, the voice, all things is this teaser. Omg SG need a movie! SERIOUS
i really what them to make this into a anime series
WE WANT SERAPHINE STAR GUARDIAN
We don't want ugly star guardians we want Seraphine and cute girlies
Yeah disappointed no pve mode. I'm not the only one out here riot.
Okay so now that Arcane is a complete success, can we at least have a full blown SG series?
👌👀
👌👀
plz no more anime
PLS MAKE STAR GUARDIAN SION OR I COMMIT ********* ***** ******* ******
Am I the only one who saw battle academia Katarina?
stop trying to make seraphine happen, it won't happen
As we agreed many times before - the art department is pretty much the one that the game woulda been long dead without.
Make a starguardian anime, please, your animations are so good!
you should have given leona the star guardian and rell the high noon, this will be the most painful thing i have ever experienced
Si makoto shinkai ata may gawa nito ganda ng scenery
I'm sry but for a moment I thought it's Genshin Impact
4K 지렸다 ㄷㄷ
Rito ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Give Star Guardians PvE
야 룰루내놔 ㅡㅡ
Still no star guardian Taric. Go damnit riot
Tha animations are on point!!!!!!
WEEBS ASSEMBLE
No Valorant?
The sg ekko is not it :(
Lool, League of legends become to uwu Anime Manga
and then you have on the otherside of the world people fighting themselfs with bows and swords..
So when is the anime starting?
L
im sure you could make a tv series out of this and have 40 year old men + 11 year old girls buying the merch to it like they were the next best thing since sliced bread. it would be like sailor moon got a 2022 fresh release from episode 1 with beautifully drawn artwork.
как же красиво
Yess!! Finally anime in 4k baby!!
Star Guardian Katarina PLEASE
reminds me of animes like "You Name" beautiful animation
와 미쳤다!!!!! 별수호자 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Amm I wish too  come back and the event Star Guardia's. Come on Rito that mode was amazing. We wish too see it again in our lobby
일본감성   Kimi no namae wa?
메이플광고같노
This is like watching 2 hour movie 🍿🍫🎥
The quality is great, but the most touching thing is that Riot shows this kind of emotion.
need anime
Nah if riot makes an anime I'd defo WATCH IT
The video and the music kind of reminds me of a studio Ghibli movie
alime
Soooooo, why can't this become an anime?? Visuals are perfect for it.
씹덕은 돈이 됀다.
Star Guardian Gwen, come into my life.
我超，这太二次元了
Imagine living in a magical girl city. Must wake up with a smile on your face every day
Too bad we are not getting a PvE but we are getting another spellbook which is really boring it's a never ending sickle between urf and this it's sad really
another female champ ?
涙が出た
wow .. just wow ~  sakura vibe  and league in one is the best combo to open the game on ~ nice animation ~
Clearly studio ghibli instpired <3
I'm actually speachless, the animation level is something beyond every imagination, the ambience is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen
it reminded me of 5 Centimeters per Second 2007   anime movie. it uses the same art style actually
nemsobot
Good. W8ing 4 Urgot. In dress. Or mb Alistar\Darius :)
Star guardian yuumi when?
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN TARIC
Korean Pop culture meets Studio Ghibli.
why does it look like the plot for 5 cm per second (really good anime would recommend 5/5)
this animation style reminds me of the movie ''your name''
Can't wait for the drop of the new  anime
AYAYA
nice walpapers, ty rito
Pretty nice made
The ending part reminds me of spiritfarers T--T
whos at the end ?
Rito, I need a movie for this.
who is the artist of these drawings??
Star Guardian bard please
Riot Please, entertaiment let's go
Pretty. Wonderful animation. Wonder if the event is pve or pvp based. Either way im here for it
Kinda sad that the characters art style doesn't look like the old style tbh, because it now looks like a real anime style as seen in the end im maybe wrong though because riot do like making some scenes 2d and others 3d.  But if their gonna go 2d on the whole cinematic, well I guess that's okay...but I like old style more though.
so when will this anime be release?
einfach anime dig ga
The event dropping on my birthday couldn’t be any better
is this like...some kinda new Shinkai's flim or something? why am i never heard of this before???
im squealing
The next level.
우르곳을 다시 수호자답게!
다시 발로란트로
얘넨 진ㅉ ㅏ영화산업 안하고 뭐하냐
뭐냐 이 한국인 애니 일본풍 도시 거리위 중국 물건들 ㄷㄷ해
i'm bawling my eyes out. it's so pretty.
We need the anime series 💀
If the pink-haired maid is Seraphine I might consider go back to LOL, LOL.
so many characters would fit the theme infinetly better, but whatever ig. Also that's the teaser, some anime bs and that's it.
극장판임?
I think you should switch to filmmaking
또 일본풍이냐 역겨운 라이엇놈들
Can someone please tell me the studio they hired to animate this trailer
Lindo demais saaa
No graggy sadge.
Wtf is this a product from a game company? In a sec I think it from the anime company!!!
this is why i hate games it appeals to the female fantasy
Is it an anime film ?
kaisa senpai..... I love you!
Rito entertainment
that lock with xayah and rakans feathers MY HEART!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've been playing League of Legends ever since I was a boy and I can tell you right now there was nothing I played longer and with more enjoyment than the player vs environment modes, I've logged thousands of hours into this game and would gladly log thousands more playing this PvE modes it is so much better for the community as well there is almost 0 competition in these modes it is solely based around fun USUALLY these game modes may be hard to maintain and keep fresh but isn't a little bit of hard work what makes video games differ from the rest? There's an art to League of Legends and I worry we descend rather than ascend . Bring back Ascension, Doom Bots, The Original Nexus Blitz with purchasable summoner spells. Dark Star, and far more these modes give league a fresh life and a true different feel from normal League of Legends.
im going to go feral if we get nothing but the ultimate spellbook gamemode
Wtf this video vibes🥶😱, the city looks so beautifull, please Riot make a star guardian become anime series 🙏🙏🙏
Valoran city. seriously...
Star guardian RGM coming back??? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make a anime now. RIOT!
Let's gooo its back
Porterrrrrrrrrrrrrr
this is so beautiful. Like i love it so much. OMG. All who helped make this, I hope you read this. I think it's amazing and you should make more C=....please.

RIOT PLEASE MAKE ANIME!!! PLEASEEE!!
makoto shinkai has been quiet lately
Cara eu posso estar muito louco, mas aos 0:16 parece que alguém cochichou "jhin" e 4 segundos depois aparece uma flor...
Rito: "We're probably not ever going to do PVE ever again. We don't know how make money from it." Gamers: "OOoH pReTtY aRT! tAkE MUnnY! WhEn PvE?"
New Japan patch looking good
Wtf
I hoped this was the trailer for a new anime movie, and then I realised it was for LoL ;)
MAKE A ANIME OF THIS IN MY TABLE NOW!!!!

So the pink long hair lady here is kaisa
Katarina?!?!?!

There better be urgot
I love this trailer. Gives incredible Your Name vibes (or Makoto Shinkai vibes in general). Also I love how almost every shot looks like a Visual Novel scene.   Can't wait for the event
That Rakan and Xayah moment broke me-
QUE HERMOSA TEMÁTICA
YA QUIERO QUE SALGAN
DIOS MÍO QUE HERMOSOOO
일본 애니네 살짝 역겹다
SHE IS KAI'SA!!
Thank you God
LET ME DATE FIDDLE YOU ANIMALS
seraphine q nojo

If that's Seraphim... I'm out.  I barely care about LoL anymore anyways.
League of weebs
Oh my godddddddddd ie been waiting for season 333333333

"star guardian Lux" for the 3th time
14/7 ahi ta XD
Its not xayah maybe its katarina
I came here for Porter Robinson and stayed for the animation
poka cycuchy :3
Make an Anime out of it
Nice Lux.
Yes, she was Kaisa!
are all of these comments just bots?
I was thinking im watchin an Anime teaser and was like  whats the name of it and when does it come our  I  want to watch it
You're fired
Star Guardian Seraphine?
PORTER ROBINSON
Hmm, nice void event.....
We need full anime now. I know arcane is good but we need animation like this. This reminds me of makoto shinkai movie Your name.
I hope Hiroyuki Sawano will also be back !
i hate riot games but i love porter robinson
porter robinson
Yes yes yess!
All this to play ARURF. Again and again and again every years like if the time stopped.
I think that's kaisa she looks beautiful❤️
ale gówno
I think the heart note in the locker said rengar on it?
GIVE US AN ANIME NOW
Lol this is so anime
Is this a anime or why is it recommended to me?
WTF is this cancerous framerate???
Mds um dia antes do meu aniversárioooooo melhor presente possivel
Is that katarina?
Riot will REALLY miss if they dont do a star guardian asol, hopefully the globe was a sol reference, even like a star guardian villain would be cool for him, it would fit with his abilities the beat weve ever seen in this game
This is by far my favorite teaser from League of Legends. I am so very excited for Star Guardians to make a come back! <3
Okay and here I thought 0:44 was Ahri while in fact it was Kai'Sa!!!
Rito make an anime RIGHT NOW OR ELSE
where fiddle
한국 같으면서도 일본스런 배경이네
PORTER ROBINSON COLLAB, LETS GOOOOOOOOO
irgendwie erinnern mich die Haare an Katarina Academia
so riot is now doing shojo anims XD
so like... in my birthday?
Only toxic people the ones who didn't like the MODs so riot should ignore those and make the start guardian mod againnn 😭☹️❤
wow, after 3 year Star Guardian is back! Beautiful Japanese settings with sakura
another star guardians?? one trick pony. make a vlad animation or something new!!
I need this as a wallpaper. Who can help me?
If thats Seraphine at the end yall really just lost another million players...
Njir kyk grafik kimi no nawa
iyice winx club oldu oyun
♡♡♡♡♡
I thought this was Star Citizen :D
5 cm/s reference anyone?
風格好像秒數五釐米喔！！
I saw this and was like. O I miss watching anime... O look there is stuff in League and Wild and LOR! LIT!
MAKOTO SHINKAI IS THAT YOU???
oh no... this event might bring me back to League again.. oh no!
Feels like Shinkai Makoto has touched this project. Too bad it's not a whole movie, otherwise I would definitely watch it!
Le 14 Juillet ? La pris de la Bastille ? Comme par hasard !
Rito, would you please make an anime based on this?? With this kind of animation in netflix??
they should make an anime
Do you think it's Katarina ?
สวยมากกก
akalii🍜
신카이 마코토 향 찐하게 나네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Eu tô desconfiado que no final do vídeo que é a katarina que aparece no vídeo
Just make a star guardians anime already 😭❤️
Люблю когда риот рисуют видосики из которых буквально каждый кадр можно ставить на рабочий стол.
There is something blinking in the far dark streeet in 0:15
incredible graphics are amazing
you'd better take care of the game balance because recent years have been a drama
Только не серафина, умоляю...
Invasion where.
not cute i ask myself when finaly oktoberfest tf , sona , teemo, singed and jax will be released (tf throw beer lid , sona sings folk music and has beer mug in the hand not a keyboard, teemo throws little pretzels, singed release radler, and jax fight with a shooting gallery toy
WE DONT NEED THIS. FIX THE GAME. IT IS IN TERRIBLE STATE.
I love how you can see the lock with Xayah and Rakans feathers on it - I'm hyped!
Show
this is so beautiful. and much pink. ✨ i'm wait for new things in the game which will make me happy and shocked. :)
Красиво

Impresionante
Parece a fonte do genshin impact
Pfvr riot lança um anime de  Star Guardians, eu lhe imploro

SeRaPhInE AnImE WhEn?!4

I wonder if we'll finally get a star guardian / Academia Kayle
Where Star Guardian Urgot?
who is this girl? katarina?

It reminds me of director Shinkai Makoto's drawing style. So pretty.
This reminds me Madeon & Porter Robinson' "Shelter" Music Video! GG Guys , impressive animation

IM CRYING
Dammit Netflix!  Make this to a show!!
Imagine riot would release a arcane-ish series in SG style
THANK YOU! I HAVE MISSED MY GIRLS SO MUCH! <3
Can Riot do more cinematics and clips like this pleaseeeeeeeee because this clip is absolutely gorgeous and has so much to it.
i hope we get like a 30 min full anime episode  cinematic
Make this into a show please  New riot anime  For the love of riot devs
I mean I guess but don’t tease an event and do a different one
100% 세라핀나옴
Thank you for making me want to live a little bit for this event.
It has so much japanese vibe.... i don't know if it is their intention to mkae it looks just like anime... but i would prefer they make it more casual It not must be that kind of table type, gachapon machines, shoe cupboards.... I mean it is not that it bad, but they can make it culturally diverse right? Riot not a japanese company tho and the game already  go viral enough... i think we could have expect it to be more globalization and.... is it not happy when you see something in your country just pop up in some anime kind of firm, especially by riot - a movie company?  Joke aside, can you pls like this? I want people to share thought with me
This scenery and art style really reminded me of the anime movie Your Name (Kimi no na wa). Truly beautiful!
Who is that girl🤔
:V
I wonder who that is 😏😏😏😏   Huh my audience disappeared???
Is the background vocals would be the intro ingame music like the other star guardians?
Riot studio coming out with an anime
Who was that at the end? Oh how i wiah they'll make seraphine into a star guardian.
istg rito if u dont put star guardian lore on netflix
Riot, anime pls>?
애니를....애니를 내줘라 라이엇....
Even today i love original star guardian theme. Also really like the story we had upon Ahri team release. And memories from Star Guardian coop event are among my very best that league ever gave me. With all that said, i'm extremely happy to see this theme back!
Why did this give me feels
Your Name new version?🤔
Take my wallet
the vibes of this are immaculate <3 it's so beautiful and emotional; i love it so much
riot got the best marketing and content team in the game
I always thought that girl on the last frame is Seraphine with all objects goes direct to her like singing studio, but I remember if it's Seraphine, where her REALLY long hair and make confused is it Seraphine or kai'sa 😩
omg league of wibu
:0
And you're telling me that is not katarina >:3
Skarner model 2009 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Looks like a Star Guardian Katarina. But what we really need, is a Star Guardian Garen, in full Sailor Regalia.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
riot, make a star guardian anime already-- i swear people would easily eat it up
so i think everything riot have made is better than the game itself..
Se for a lux mano sério vai se ferraaaaaaa
Why ppl kept saying genshin2 thingy ?
nice new event.
세라핀 얘는 나온지 얼마나됐다고 스킨이또쳐나오냐 ㅋㅋ
PvE please!!!
This is one of the most embarrassing corporate efforts I've ever seen. A bunch of weeb westerners got together after watching two Makoto Shinkai movies and said "uwaaa we can do that!!!!!!!" and made the most blatant ripoff, low effort content for the sake of their fulfillment fantasy. I'm embarrassed for everyone involved in this, waking up every day thinking "i wish i was born in beautiful nation of nippon!!!!! i wish i was japanese!!!!" and making this horribly bootlegged imitation of animation.
New game is coming. Genshin Legend Impact League
Sick video nice art ;) !
I hope there will be some romance between Ezreal and Lux.. since it is a part of the SG lore (pretty sure), plus the setting gives off a romantic vibe
If you peeps rly like the Animation so much go watch Movies made by Makoto Shinkai
PLEASE MAKE A STAR GUARDIAN MOVIE 😭!!! I REALLY LOVE THEM
Star Guardian Gragas when
I still believe in one day, one of the Japanese Animation Studio will produce a fine anime of League of Legends or something that related to Runetera's Universe
Hoho ikuzooooo
Im so FREAKING PUMPED FOR THIS
Katarinaaaaaaaa
It gives me vibes of SAILOR MOON and REVOLUTIONARY GIRL UTENA because of the uniform colors and the roses. I can't wait for these to be released.
why is Porter Robinson mentioned in the description?  I'm his long-time fan♥️
its ok
Finally more Star Guardians I want to create an anime based of this if that’s okay. The reason in 2019 the Light and Shadow was released on my birthday that’s why it’s special to me.
não gostei feio
This is perfect for some lofi screengrabs/screensavers...anyone?
After watching this I forgot about how dark and evil is Bel'Veth cinematic.
14th of July, that means I'm yet another year older... but it's probably worth it, because then I can watch this!
Glad this popped up on my feed. Animation is gorgeous! Will check this out.
I wish they would more animation series. This one too is beautiful, like you can really feel how much time and effort went into making it.
Hope they add star guardian Urgot this time
I'm losing my head...  [madoka magica fans got this joke]
That locker.. its kaisa locker The mic and the drum for seraphine
wow
CRYING THAT THIS IS A WILD RIFT EXCLUSIVE PLS DONT DO IT IM WARNING YOU WAHJAJXMMSKS

I was reminiscing about "Your Name" and then I watched this Teaser. I'm in tears. What do you want Riot ? I'll gladly give it to you.
If you add pve, this will be the greatest gift for my birthday. 07.17 I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT!!
First LoL anime when second Katarina?!
I'm super glazing excited pls make it anine already after the arcane pls. SG will come back now valoran yeahey pls. Make it now charrrrizz Yeah I'm talking OA now pls. Make  the stars align and protect earth then your dreams will be in future.
So, i'm with this universe from like season 6 when jhin was still a new thing from what i remember, i enjoyed playing this game as much as i also got frustrated with so many matches, having breaks of long time cuz life then could come back to it, i ended up playing just for fun, just because i like the game and the universe, just because i love the champions and the story behind them, so no more frustrating over a lost match haha but lately i kinda stopped playing, i barely have one match sometimes. I don't know, this game has something, something that makes you to let it go. But i'm still here, maybe more because of the universe they created and the work they put behind this universe and behind this videos we see and behind the big ARCANE that hits differently and just make you love something about this... whole story. So i'm still here waiting for new series to come out and waiting to enjoy them ^-^
weeb paradise
PORTER ROBINSON?!!???!?!?!!!!

Dislike seraphine. She looks so creepy… a stick with an alien face. but I love the mermaid aesthetic and SG. Shame it’s being wasted on her :/

Star guardian Seraphine, period. XD
thank you riot very much we missed
So I'm sure Kai'Sa will be included on the new line-up. She will be simultaneously releases on Legends of Runeterra with Star Guardian event probably. Can't wait 💜
Как будто Макото Синкай делал кадры, рисовка в его стиле!
Rito pliz do Star Guardian Anime
My favourite event eveeeer <3
why league is like a anime nowadays? i know u need to fanservice the silvers otaku base that pays u but please, make it less obvious, im playing a competitive game not a rpg otaku playground
es como si makoto shinkai trabajara en Kyoto animation....
Dear Rito Games... Pls dont dissapoint. U know what i mean.
Heimer with the science room?? So Seraphine, Xayah and Rakan, and then Heimer?
Épico
It's like almost watching anime-series teaser...
Kok anime lagi sih anjirr.. sekali kali monster kek..
Great! But I really look forward to a void event.
ААААААААААА, это лучшее с момента Аркейна. Боже Риоты, сделайте чертову полнометражку или сериал в этом стиле, и фанаты принесу все к вашему пьедесталу.
Tô sem palavras. Foda-se, isso é lindo pra caralho
OMG SONA IS COMING QWQ

Yıldız Muhafızı Sona Mı geliyor Yoksa :D

Valorant city
inb4 pink haired girl is Sona

PvE coming back when?
PVE please
Between pool party, project, blood moon and star guardian Im just tired of seeing the same stuff over and over again. Feels like nothing really new or interesting has come out in a while😬
muito ruim riot 😎👍
Mordekaiser Star Guardian when?
this trailer is just like an opening of a romcom anime series , also is remind me when i wasin highschool, too
Can we please have an anime/movie already? lol
Yes, bel'veth star guardian
Ебаный кал. Чините баланс.
영상이 너무 아름다워요
I'm hyped about the music collab with Porter Robinson!!
Omg star guardian is back its so UwU im so excited 🥰
I Hope it's PVE returning teaser
Weeb Riot 😂
Going back and watching the other cinematics and it’s crazy how much they all still hold up. Love the star guardian line
07.14 is when? its like on the 7th of 14th month? guys who mix up dates like this are gorgeus
I wonder if they add urgot as a weird fan they see at the shop or something.
Petition for Riot to make an anime out of this :)
This looks like a Makoto Shinkai film with some more whimsy
Trás o modo pve de novo, pelo amor de deus
Qué buena animación ❤ esta genial
I hope the SG pve mini game comes back!
it was so anime they even used the Genshin font
Can your make a series of animated films? Please.
Anime: The Trailer
i need every one of these scenes as a wallpaper
I knew it was Porter Robinson the moment I heard the buildup! So hyped!
Hagan un anime , una película , un juego , algo ☹️ , así nos tienen a todos los que vimos Madoka y el corto que hicieron de Neko vs Zoe ☹️
Oh my god I’m such a big star guardian fan aaaaaaaaaaaa
Star Guardian Seraphine S2
wtf is this sick animation omg
i will su*k di*k for a PVE event again PLEASE
I was waiting for this so much! Yay! ♥
Rell SG LOL!
More Star Guardian PVE, please!  I loved that event.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
🤯
hopping its the pve event if not idc
I just want to see the fiddle
An Anime like this pls :)
Insane!
Man they really nailed the feeling of a cool new anime there.  I couldn't tell this was league related.
You know it feels like an anime movie by Makoto Shinkai
Please make that a film
FINALLY
Kata?
I really hope the PvE gamemode has its comeback. I put so many hours into the star guardian gamemode and got this icon for playing on the hardest difficulty and getting an S. So worth it, I would do it again and again.
I may just be fooling myself when I say Star Guardian will be a series like Arcane
what is this ?
wow this is so beautiful i hope RIOT makes a new anime just like this
I'm way more excited for this than I should be lol
Who is this?
Whos the girl with the pink hair? Battle Academia Katarina?
guys guys how much will the pass probably be
I NEED THIS RIOT PLS MAKE IT AS ANIME PLS RIOT I BEG U
RAKAN AND XAYAH LOCK SO CUTE
YESSSSS
Obviously its Sera where is Star Guardian Zed???
please give us a new topic not always the same ( Star Guardian , Bilgewater , Shadow Isle ) they have been repeated so often now .... whats with Freljord , Shurima or Ionia stuff wish we had so movie stuff about that instead all that repeated boring old stuff
Porter robinson? sheeesh
Rakan and xayah 😭😭
do an anime with 700 ep to include all champions like one piece
ah yes league of impact
Little mermaid song vibe?
Anivia Star Guardian RIOT??? PRA ONTEM NA MINHA MESA
Riot, eu te amo, cara como eu te amo
League of Legends < Riot animations
It's a teaser but the animations and art style surpasses netflix lol
Just Amazing!!!
STAR GUARDIAN YI INCOMMING
sauce?
I hope they bring back Hiroyuki Sawano to compose the new Star Guardian theme.
It make me feel like 5cm/s and Your lie in April combination, too beautiful <3
OMG!
insane to think the studio which animated this also animated the worst episode of love, death % robots season 1 D: this looks so much better
STAR GUARDIAN UDYR PLZ
Seraphine star guardian? if i'm right that was amazing
milking the genshin impact vibes
Why not an anime about star guardian story 😍
IMAGINE STAR GUARDIAN ANIME SERIES OMG - Xayah and Seraphine i feel were hinted here ?
IT IS BACK AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Valorant x Valoran /
the most amazing part is that the girl could be 50 different champs because 90% of the women have the same facial structure
See! Told u y'all riot is an studio entertainment not a freaking gaming industry!!
League of anime
Star guardian fiddlesticks is coming
beautiful art
It looks like kind to me an Anime trailer
I soo wish this could be an anime. A story on all the SG characters
Man Riot Please make an Anime with the champions ! <3
very beautiful
Man, I thought a Void event was coming up, and instead it's yet more Star Guardian. I feel like Star Guardian has the most niche fanbase out of all the themes they have available to them.
EPaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
After Arcane, they should definitely make a Star Guardian or Battle Academia series.
So... Star Guardian Seraphine, Sona and Zeri? XD
Can be  a star guardian trailer or a trailer of any slice of life anime xD
PORTER ROBINSON????? I SEE THAT NAME YOU SNUCK AT THE END
Yikes 😬😬😬
This is so beautiful <3 I'm so sad that the world is coming to an end =(
riot is best anime creator, best animation creator, best series creator, best story creator and has best toxic gamer community.
Insert general anime school girl that no one cares about hear here
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMGG
There is Star Guardian Rek'Sai? Only me waiting her?
Star guardian seraphine?👀😍
Seraphine? New best waifu for Riot games :D
but please bring back the starguardian gamemode !!
that genshin impact vibe at the end
your name vibes :3
😳
league of legends the anime, when?
Xayah And Rakan goes brr
what battle acameia?
Riot Anime Entertainment 😆😆😆😆
Woahhh Rito take my money.
Do I hear another Hiriyoki Sawano song coming up
this is just monogatari
They licensed this thing to a studio for an anime 100%. I don't think they would be hyping up star guardiang so much otherwise.
Make japanese dub as main dub pleasee
The world when irelia,akali, veigar didn't exist:
The beginning is almost 1:1 the scarlet nexus main menu theme. Change my mind
i luv anime rito
I'M READY
when nerf irelia?
К черту Аркейн нам нужно полноценное Аниме по ЗЗ и БА, и да Синкая позовите пусть он вам облака рисует
I will pack up my bags and move there and no one can stop me
0:36  AKALI DRAWED EVELYNN :ooo❤️‍🔥
I want an animated show of star guardian. Please Riot.
A new anime? a colab with riot and coca cola? okay lets go
It's been awhile
I hope that this SG that will come, i believe that the SG mode on league is going to release it because i miss that game mode on league. I hope riot games come up with that event on League
heros not ayaya. make it cool
KAI'SA AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!
뚜방뚜방
Somebody knows when the PBE for this will start?
Star Guardian Urgot is official then?!?
This was so beautiful, it reminded me of makoto shinkai movies👏
please dont be seraphine
I want a star guardian series
2016 : Sailer Moon 2017 : Pretty Cure 2019 : Song by Hiroyuki Sawano 2022 : Makoto Shinkai - like trailer
EU SO COMECEI A JOGA LOL POR CAUSA DAS GUARDIÃSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MAU POSSO ESPERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
WE WANT THE PVE EVENT BACK RIOT NOT JUST SKINS!!!!!!!!!!I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT SINCE 2017 WHEN I FIRST STARTED AND DIDNT GET THE CHANCE TO PLAY IT. ODYSSEY WAS THE BEST.BRING PVE EVENTS BACK ITS NOT ALL ABOUT THE CASH GRAB
why is porter robinson in the description?
Rito wibu 😮‍💨
So... league IS an anime?
I want my Rell in the animation this year plzzzzzzz
wow its coming
작화 개지린다
АААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА моя прелесть! Хочу скорее их увидеть <3
Which champ is it at the ending?
This video is so cool... but I still have one question, why there is a porter robinson at the details?
Por favor Riot a comunidade implora por um anime das star guardiãs :( 💞
Anime name
TAKE MY MONEY!!!! …….also very beautiful animation reminded me of your name and weathering with you.
Just to make it clear, this isn't a new game, this isn't a show or a movie, this is just a teaser for a skinline and an event. I love how much effort Riot puts into their work to make even the smaller stuff really hype!
That reason WHY i call them riot entertainment not riot game lol
Who’s the girl? Kaisa or katarina?
Genre: Shoujo, Slice of life, School
Anime anime
mm i think its lux because lux eye color purple
anime?? :DD
I don't know why, but watching this, bring out  tears in my eye and joy to my heart. The music,the details,thanks Riot for giving me a memoir of League Of Legends.
I was really waiting for the Void Event, but if this is a PvE event, I can wait for as long as it's needed. Star Guardians is a really cool alternative universe for League, so exploring more of it is always welcomed. Besides, if Void Event NEEDS time, at least they're giving us something. And I'm sure we want a good and well-organized Void Event. Ruination was cool, but... a bit underwhelming and sort of a mess...
I know we got Arcane already but I will pay a stupid amount of money to see a Star Guardian anime. Give all the parallel universes shows!
The best think EVER Star Guardian, KDA/True Damage and Pentakill.
First ten seconds and I was overwhelmed with so much awe that it escaped my eyes in the form of a tear. Always so gorgeous with your trailers, Riot; every single one is a work of art.
Bring the Actual Star guardian Urgot. You decided to go with the Joke instead of challegning it. Which left a medicre experince, Causing Challeging the notion"This Surely is Cretively impossible" leads to either The most Amazing Successes or the most intersting failures,  Pijama guairdan urgot is a cope out, Bring me the Real Star guardian urgot!
everything else looks so dirty after watching this.
I still miss the (2016)Star Guardian event i hope that rito will bring it back again even just for a week.. But i'm glad that SG are coming back again, STAR FEATHER! ❤❤
sg shyvana, gwen?
so..you want me to play League?
IF YOU WANT RIOT MAKE A ANIME LIKE THIS
ASHE sTAR gUARDIANS ??????? EU VI ISSO ? .... RIOTINS S ....
Lmao did Rito just hired Shinkai Makoto for a new trailer?
Still waiting for a star guardian magical girls anime
I love this Anime Style Animation.
words can't express how wonderful this looks
7/14 the national day of france. Guess there will be more fireworks in the sky this night
Porter Robinson?! Ohh, oh yes. Yes please Riot.
This looks absolutely breathtaking. I hope those artists are paid well!
Bruh i want the star guardian line to just be an anime of its own really
Finally! <3
Try to not create champs which overloaded with mechanics instead of forking sailor moon
It gives me so much Madoka magika / Sailor Moon anime vibes that I almost thought it was a new anime teaser lol
Aye wildrift
Riot Game❎ Riot Animation & MV music ✅ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
cant wait
Riot should make movies, i am sure their movies tickets will sell like marvel movies
I SAW SERAPHINE WE WANT TARIC
This seriously looks like something out of  Makoto Shinkai's works man, can wait to see more of it
Pedophilia sequel 2 wtf
I think the girl is Kai'Sa. When she turns there is a few frames of her eyes and they are purple like Kai'Sa's.
This teaser is so stunning. Every frame could be a wallpaper. Every shot can tell a story. I can't wait for this event. Hope it lives up to the hype!!✨
game mode please
you made the series now make an anime
I feel pretty watching this trailer
Ppl keep saying that the girl is lux, but lux has purple eyes and kaisa on the other hand has peache like hair and red eyes from what I have heard so maybe it's seraphine she has blue eyes
Shikimori Star Guardian ?
seraphi
또 세리판이야 ㅋ
if you don't give the star guardian event back it means nothing!
Is that Seraphine at the end? Because eyes and face looks like Seraphine's, if it is I'm 100% buying her!!!
Soo does this mean SG jewelry line coming soon?
14 month its when?
Fudeu
Finally!! SG is back..
THAT'S SERAPHINE!!!
the animation team and the music team are the best
daora ninhem esperava jogo da barbe
I like star guardians. 🌟 🙂🙂
Please reksai star guardian
YAY ITS BACK!
This looks stunning Riot , we appreciate everything you do with League  💙💙
J'en ai rien a foutre de Star guardian, moi je veux Snow Moon
Animation company
This would be a pretty cool anime
Rita please we want Star Guardian Gragas
I'll bet there be a star guardian seraphine
i really hope that the girl is lux ang not sera, it would be pretty disappointing that her hair is pink even though her base hair color is pink.  though i doubt its sera due to sera having natural big hair, but it's still a possibility.
im having ghibli feels to the animation RIOT make a series like Arcance but now with the star guardians with this animation
Star guardian shyvana and seraphine?
Chinese game
will there be a new game mode?
발로만든~ 발로란트~ 망했죠~? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
IMO this cinematic has Fate Stay Night vibe.
League of legend, the anime series would be good.
ayo fckers kaisa isnt pink she's purple....... She's hot anyway.
can believe they make a game to promote this video
OMG I was waiting som much for this 🥺🥲 I LOVE STAR GUARDIANS UNIVERSE, IT IS FOR ME THE BEST ONE
Kayle or anivia
Give us another sawano hiroyuki song
You can't really return to somewhere you've never been to before. I don't think I was playing during the last Star Guardian Event(s)? 🤔

Its lux
what's porter robinson doing at the bottom of the description?
There’s no way that they have Hiroyuki Sawano on the soundtrack again.. right?
I can't see why people love Star Guardian so much. It's such a boring aesthetic...
That's Lux's School & that was Lux with Ahri's pendant!🤩💖
the chills xD
Segs
I wish they would make a skinline animated series/movie, star guardians or highnoon would be awesome

STAR GUARDIAN GRAGAS PLZ!!!
Come on Riot, Arcane showed that people are more than willing to watch a league show, so I see absolutely no reason to not start production on a Star Guardians anime
와이프한테 이말을 해야하나 하지말아야하나 당장에 결혼을 생각하는 와이프에게 시중에 있던 전재산을 허위매물에 당했다고 말을 하기가 너무 쪽팔렸고 어느날, 친구테 말했더니 좋은방법이 있다며 덤홀덤 을 알려줌! 네이버에 덤홀덤 검색만해도 나오니까 ㄱㄱ
gosh, all the animes LoL could make from Runeterra (is that the planet's name???) at different timelines or their entirety Edit: Wrong word
This trailer is beautiful, I feel like I need a still of every individual frame to just stare at!!! Or make a live wallpaper or something!!! its so pretty ahhhhhhhh
막상 글을 쓰려고 하니 손이 떨리네요..마누라가 이 글을 보게 될까 봐 두렵지만,도저히 아무 데도 말할수가 없어서 이렇게 조언 구합니다.마누라를 처음 만난 건 2년 전, 거짓말 못 할것 같은 사람이였거든요. 제 와이프가 저몰래 이런걸 할줄 상상도 못함 네이버에 덤홀덤 이라는걸 검색하더니 30분만에 5만원으로 40만원을 만들더군요.
No one noticed Porter Robinson's credits... Yikes.
Yooo the Riot animation team doesn't miss 💯 I'm so excited!
valorant city?
I can't believe we're finally getting Keit-Ai.
Больше скинов на Серафину.
Будто отрывки с мультфильмов Макото Синкая)))
This is just so beautiful and peaceful! Like, why is it so wonderful?! 😭😭
LUXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Onichan
I had to pause at each scenes to appreciates the details and artworks.
PORTER??????
Finally a LoL dating simulator. I call dibs on Draven.
🤯
Proper star guardian Urgot now?
Love papa rito <333
Honestly if they made a Star Guardian spin-off series akin to Arcane it would be through the roof. As for the upcoming Star Guardian stuff I am more excited about the music as usual.
THATS LUX?
Strong Makoto Shinkai vibes
The girl at the end is Lux based on her black blouse and the logo. and if you watch the burning bright video you will see its identical and that necklace must be from ahri and probably hints that something has happened to her.
I love it! So beautifully made <3
IMMMMMM STILLL STANDING
Star guardian Seraphine ekslusif in wild rift🥶🥶🥶
Is that Star Guardian Katarina?

Zyra,Sona,Ashe,Akali,Diana
WHERE IS MY STAR GUARDIAN SKARNER
beautiful trailer
And here I was hoping for a Void-related event. Instead, we get more weeb content.  Ugh.
The animations tho! 😍✨ it gets me super excitedddddddddd! 🙈😭
CTY giải trí Riot  Làm game để quảng cáo Trailer  :)
This seems like they will pull a gacha type of style in claiming the rewards in the star guardian event...
hoping for the event gameplay like the star guardian invasion from the past that was my reason to play this game actually but I was too late to play from that event
The long awaited StarGuardian Illaoi come!?
I get so confused when I see 07/14 Then I remember that Riot is based in the US
ANIME WHEN???
come on riot cant you just give us a anime series just one season
WE NEED A STAR GUARDIAN SHOW !!
Omg YESSS
<3
SG Game Mode return????? PLEASE
I just want to know when anime adaptation will be released
sheraphin ?
Do an anime!!!!!
Dislike, prefer  Lol
Si es Seraphine, voy a cometer una locura
still not over this teaser i'm so excited for the new event 😭💞 riot never fails to amaze us

Wild rift, runeterra, and lol event at the same time? Also love that rackan/xayah lock
So when’s the anime??

"Fine give me star guardian skarner"
I'll come back if there is pve
Star guardian Gragas incoming !! XD hahaha can you imagine 🤣. What am i saying ? They have to give it to Seraphine of course...

its katarina?
Can u give me anime already ?
kaisa senpai, suki
И кто сказал что ваша лига не anime?
Please star Guardian akali please
Terrible, i hate everything about this, it adds nothing to the actual lore of Runeterra
Please bring Rakan home ;w;
Who is that pink lady ?
0:28 is that Rell in the picture or taliyah I can't tell its gotta be one of them for sure though. This event is going to do so well, they don't even have to go all out they only need to be better than ruination
Ahhhh Seraphine??????? My queen
PORTER FREAKIN ROBINSON <3
I want more music like from the neeko trailer
very cool
How many Lo-Fi hip hop backgrounds did they use for "inspiration"
Probably in the next 200yrs will finally get an anime adaptation
Seraphine?
Star guardian nilah
This is an anime wow
Seraphine🤔
Sona Please :3
Да ну, неужели решили вспомнить.
No one is talking about the fact that they are bringing seraphine as a star guardian omg 🥺🥺🥺🥺💫💗
Pve pls I beg
PORTER ROBINSON IS MAKING A SONG FOR THIS STAR GUARDIAN EVENT????? 😭😭❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏
just make an anime already please? :) also who was that at the end? sera? who knows
Was that Kaisa?
I missed them so much, I can't wait for it!!!
どの会社が作ったの、クオリティめっちゃ高い！
Where are all the people? Why are they gone? Why is she the only one?
Is that Seraphine???
Are they bringing back that star guardian event?
когда новый скин на гвен?😭
Makes me nostalgic for my high school year abroad in japan 💔
These animations still fill my soul with joy after going through rough times
Apenas o melhor evento do ano ❤️🥺
Give me a dating sim or give me death
뭐 어쩌란거야
I'm excited to see who the new Star Guardians are gonna be!
you couldn't make me care about this skinline or event, even if you paid me to
pve mode? pve mode? pve mode?
Just make an anime movie this is movie quality
just make an anime at this point
If Sona isn't here, I'll be very sad... she's literally the champion who would best match the Star Guardian theme! 😭
Riot please PVE
0:07 Peach notebook + 0:24 Peach smoothie + 0:28 Peach juice+pencils + 0:43 pink hair girl with PURPLE eyes = Kai'Sa
Fantastic 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
That's Lux at the end not Kaisa
This entire teaser is literally a WJSN comeback vibe...
So guys , Lux or Kai'sa ?
Okayy, star guardian really need its own series
PORTER ROBINSON???? RIOT DONT PLAY AROUND
i dont get the hype...     now i do
League of Weebs is back 🚬🗿
0:31 i can FEEL this ground material
CMON AESTHETIC
세라핑핑인가
plssss make this into  a series plsss make star guardian a series season 1 will be lux team season 2 introducing ahri
What if a whole 30 minute animation special dropped with SG22?
If only they would make an anime about star guardian or battle academia
Who is the girl?
If riot stops operating LoL and starts making musics and animation like this. They ll still have my total support
Who else would get it if Riot made a Star Guardian game like they did for the Ruined King? I would in a heartbeat!
please for the love of god, let it be a nice game mode like odyssey and before that. PLEASE RITO PLS
Feels like something else, than just another battle pass :D  Maybe some light novel again ;)
Riot faz um anime das star guardian pique glitter force pfv
Ohh myyy.. I get it already Riot here take my money!
드디어 나오는건가 별 수호자 우르곳 !!!!!
porter robinson 🤔
0:15 Star Guardian Wukong is confirmed
K-ON vibes
omori fans;
insert slice of life romance anime analog ... like clannad if you know you know
MAKE ME FEEL ALL THE THINGS, RITO.
Like!!
I wonder what is Sailor Moon creator reaction to this and I find it hilarious Kai'Sa is associated with peach fruit because people commonly use peach to describe her thiccness
Not gonna lie this animation looks straight out of a Slice of Life, Wuxia, Romance, Fantasy, Tragedy and SchoolLife Manga/Manhua
NEW STAR GUARDIAN ?! OMG YAAYYY😄
I....<3
the city name is kinda cringe lmao
Give me Star Guardian Seraphine, Riot.
what is this supposed to be?
whos she? sera or kaisa?
After Match after Zoe Dead right?
THIS IS SIMPLY STUNNING AND BEAUTIFUL AND JUST LEFT ME SPEECHLESS HOLYYYYYY
This is gonna be awesome
porter robinson???????
Who do you wanna see be on the next Star Guardian team? My vote is for Sona, Seraphine, Ashe, Zeri, or Sivir, and I'd love to see Vex and BelVeth as the dark ones
これが新海誠の新作か
Seraphine, Akali, Kai'Sa and ???
so beautiful!! I'm so excited 🙏💖
Did ahri died?
last girl has purple eyes, new character nilah has purple eyes... COINCIDENCE!? I THINK NOT
Hear me out. I think I figured out why they named Valorant "Valorant".
please make Star Guardian become anime series
Star guardian has my heart all the way. 😌 Growing up watching Mahou Shoujo as a little kid,ofc I would have a fond connection with this.  I look forward to the Star guardians future. Hmm,maybe a CG animation movie wouldn’t be too bad. Just a thought. 👍 I truly have no words,each time I do watch the Star guardian animations,they become more fluent and magicaleach new animation. And also,July is my birth month. 😉
otaku
PORTER ROBINSON
what????????
PLEASE RIOT!!! SG SONA IN PC!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
Riot targeting the weebs now..perfect.
i hope they put out a full cinematic when the event starts, i need more of this animation!
Finally the Anime we have been waiting for
is that kaisa :O
Can we get a new game mode like the old star guardian PvE one?  At least this event can't be worse than the ruination one
Are you guys in the process of making star guardian anime right now? Coz it's too good just for an event teaser. If you're not, make one!!! 😁😁🤭🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's Nilah at the end :3
Does this mean Star Guardian Urgot will be cannon now?
the animation looks like Makoto Shinkai works.
Valoran? surely it's not something related to valorant, a game by riot, which is a music video company, right?
i would pay so much to see an actual league of legends anime done in 2d
is that xayayh
Riot, I seriously think you guys need to rename your company from "Riot GAMES" to "Riot ENTERTAINMENT"...
"uhm...ano"
This quality, wow...
kaisa, sona, taliyah, akali, ekko, quinn, morgana, fiddlesticks, orianna, seraphine, senna, rell, caitlyn :)
Is this league or an opening scene to the first episode of an anime. Probably more than half of the riot employees have a body pillow of some guy or gal
PogChamp!
STAR GUARDIAN SERAPHINE OR RIOT 😭 Please don't make it a Wild Rift exclusive!
Please make better game models
star guardian Singed incoming
Reminds me of your lie in April…
please, bring back the old Map of star guardián in this event...
YESYESYESYESYESYESYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Bruhhhhhhh Riot making animation never disappoints...
I am the only one who hates this
Please don't say that is Seraphine
Ya puedes tomar todo mi dinero. Es más, ni siquiera esperes, te doy la cuenta
Anime filth.
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurning bright
valorant city is real!
Burning bright As we reach out for the same horizon Burning brighter Running outta time, we're chasing the light
0:14 i aint joking I started crying when I saw Rakan and Xayah love lock 😭💔
I love this
ooooooooHHHHH
My hope is one day we get a full on anime of this
0:28 와.. 별이 다섯개
I thought this was a trailer for a Star Guardian animated series.
I want another Hiroyuki Sawano masterpiece
Wish they will make star guardian anime series
Why is each cinematic always so asian/anime oriented? Needs more diversity.
Seraphine?
I hope someday Riot gonna make anime series of Star guardian
I need HiroyukiSawano Compose music for Star Guardian again
Thank you based Porter Robinson 👀👀
ok, now make the anime please.
I think its kaisa because she has purple eyes like kaisa
Very colorful and beautiful.
oh my gosh I thought they said this was happening at the end of the year??? Not in the summer?? I WAS LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW EXCITED I WAS AND COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL LIKE OCT OR LATER FOR THE "BIG SG EVENT" AND HERE WE ARE
PORTER ROBINSON
i was waiting for this <3 can´t wait
0:07 & 0:29  There are peach stickers in the notebook and locker, so she's definitely Kai'Sa. (Peaches are Kai'Sa's favourite fruits)
Epico
Kyoto animation upload new video?
As maiorais.
Make a Anime of thiiis!!!

Riot does extremely well at everything, all except the most important part: balancing
nice
Rito pelo amor de Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeus
Brasil alguém?
omg kai'sa looks soooo pretty
yes yes yes yes yes
Can I have a full anime
So we’re getting Star Guardian Seraphine and Orianna on PC right?
this for some reason reminds me of "komi-san can't communicate" the BGM reminds me of it as well an the stunning visuals that looks like the opening scene of ep 1.
I love it I'm excited this new star guardian And I think lux the pink hair new star logo
BU WER DU ANIME @ !

Please be an event, please be an event, please be a real event like the previous star guardian events.
Riot, I want at least two seasons of 25 episodes each of this anime, on my table, asap. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE BEAUTY!!!!
how awesome would it be to get a star guardian anime? i think it would be cool. i like the sg universe and i think we should explore more into it with the lore :)
This skinline always gives us goosebums, the humming voice with with the piano makes me want to cry
Star Guardian Bel' Veth confirmed ?

Trash, still no star guardian aatrox
So.....Kai'sa is the main character of this event?
The allyway shadow thing  Is defenetly   A cowering star guardian Rammus confirmed
Now this is what you call "every clip can be a wallpaper"

머여일본느낌나요
This is not a cinematic, this is an anime
cade a jinx destruindo tudo?
my dreams are coming true
Xayah and Rakan's lock is so adorable!
you cannot just drop porter's name at the end of the description like that
This an anime now?
UwU I've been waiting SO long for new Star Guardians! 💮 I first joined league when the originals came out and fell in love with SG Janna 🌪 She's been my main ever since 💕 I'd adore it if Sona got one 🎶
Bruh all the scene can be used to live wallpaper 👁️👄👁️
If something happened with Rakan heads will roll
Please let this be a PVE event I beg you Riot
Porter Robinson in the credits? :o
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

;-; finally
can we just get a Star Guardian anime already?
Arcane is Awesome i love it, BUT U DOING AN ANIME WOULD BE AMAZING TOO
The darkest nights, makes for the brightest stars 💖 I MISSED THIS SKINLINE SO BADDDDDDDDD
GIVE US THE PVE GAME MODE riot said they wont do it anymore because its too much work for such little play but thats because all the play happens at the beginning, which is because it gets stale after a bit which is easily fixable by updating it way quicker or adding more to the pve or at least i think it is hehe anyways riot you should totally hire me and not just throw away my applications
I am so speechless for a moment I would have thought this was something created by disney not riot each part of it could even bee a wallpaper, this is absolutely Gorgeous
오우쉣
LET'S GOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
별수호자 카이사 인거같은데
10덕겜이 되어버린...ㅋㅋ
se o passe for interativo e bonito que nem o florescer espiritual, vai valer a pena demais, a temática das guardiãs estelares está linda, ansiosa pelo que vai vir (:
The star guardian game modes were the most fun game modes tbh
0:23 Can anyone get this entire frame in focus?
<3
Star guardian vel koz or we go on strike >:(
star guardian ornn. definitely.
Riot pls give us a pve event again I got tired of all the passes and find them boring. I have only been playing when my friends force me to or for tournaments. I don’t like the base game anymore.
Star Guardian anime thank you bye
YES RIOT, YESSSSSSSSSSSS
I was literally just drawing the splah art for xayah and rakan and thought "i wish they would come out with new starguardian lore so they can contunie they're story" then i clicked on youtube and saw that lock on the gate with there feathers.......🥲
Perfect
작화 진짜...미쳣다
"valoran City" basically every japanese anime city
please make seraphine for pc <3
SERAPHINE⭐🌊

TALIYAH SG PLEASEEE
Man the slice of life vibes are strong. Feels like clannnad or something like that
0:15 a mysterious creature
Omgggg!! Yessss!!! 💖💖💖!! With the power of the moon 🌙!!!!
nice.
star guardian anime?
Star Guardians anime when?
Will this come to normal pc league or just wild rift
Is katarina???
It's art TwT I love star guardian
rip old star guardian event or odyssey ... those were events not just play the game and a few missions like kill baron... good old times
AAAH i'm so excited
So  Battle Academia and Star Guardian are in the same universe?? No that can't be right Academy universe (aka Academy Ekko, Vlad, Darius) and Star Guardian are in the same universe?
I'm super ready for another banger music video ♥️ And if the leaks are right, hopefully Star Guardian Senna will be awesome
MY BODY IS READY
So no ones gonna talk about Rakan and Xayah's lock? I really find it cute and romantic.
IM READY
I thought Miss Frotune was a SG too... did you foget aboty her at all??? >: (
Porter??
Just based off the context clues of "Return" to Valoran City, the peach stickers, and the bunnies everywhere it's pretty obvious it's going to be Star Guardian Kai'sa with a star bunny pet. Since she's returned from the Void and one of her favorite foods are peaches.
Finally!!
boring

The little nods to the star guardians. Rakan Xayah lock, music/band club for Ahri.. well done
If only if the balance team was as good as the animation team :(
Потом не говорите:"Лига легенд не аниме" 😂 😂
Just the 8 first seconds of the video made my jaw drop ! This whole aesthetic is litteraly so pleasing ! They really know how to make people hyped for a newcoming event and I'm people !! I'm so hyped I don't know about you guys : D
<3
I sense a new background incoming that I will use during a long time :D
나만 보자마자 신카이마코토 느낌 낫냐

It would be cool if valorant gets a star guardians themed gun. Imagine seeing brimstone charge at you with a magical girl gun.
KAI'SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
star guardian game mode returns??
네다씹
KIMI NO NAWA second season?
but what if its a arcane season, that be kinda rad
Star Guardian Kled Rito. Or at keast let Kled be canon in any other universe.

Don’t know why I feel like I’m crying while watching this..
Can you feel it, those season 6 and season 7 vibes? And here we're already in season 12. Time's just so fast...
Can't wait to hear the soundtracks for the event. Already sounds really nice. :)  Also can't wait to see Star Guardian Event in Legends of Runeterra.
Anime vibes, riot just release a series already
Nice teaser, I think anime would not be a bad idea

what a really weird and interesting teaser. whole world is empty, only this girl, probably Lux (with loose hair), alone full of memories waiting for someone...
Yess pls with Space Odyssey mechanics 🙏🏽
I love the animation. So much memories
If Arcane was a success then this series can be as well
Был же слитый скин на Кайсу, там у нее как раз были розовые волосы.
Meanwhile Jhin creating art in space
Another episode of Xayah using Rakan as a stepping stool and abusing his love for her?

PORTER x LEAGUE HMMMNGGG
I don't know if this'll get me to play League again after my less than ideal first time playing it a few years ago, but I'm hyped for you guys regardless.
I just really want Star Guardian Katarina 😥😭
PORTER ROBINSON!!!!!!!
MAKE LEAGUE INTO AN ANIMEEE
Star guardian Urgot confirmed!
Makoto Shinkai, is that you..? lol
League Of Legends is becoming a Anime oh my God
Details that I've noticed/headcanon:   Kai'sa's Desk Kaisa's phone case & familiar A photo of Lux and Ahri Windchime with Kai'sa', Rell, Sona, and Nilah's colors  Ramen Stand  A regular place for Akali (?) Nilah's water (?) Valor  Fence  Xayah & Rakan lock with their precorrupt color scheme (their colors coming to WR)   Alley  Jinx was here Are there eyes in the background and did it sneeze(?)  Gacha Machine Previous Star Guardian Skinlines  Convenient Store  Akali Ramen Cup  Wide City Shot Riot Studios Taliyah Colors (?)  Locker  Kai'sas Bunny & Peach Motif Zoe's Butterfly  Photo of Rell, Akali, and Kai  Music Room Sona's Piano Composition Seraphine's Hairtie and Glasses Oriana's Ballet slippers Seraphine's Cat Sona & Oriana's Familiars  Classroom (starting closest working back) Akali's Ramen Pins Sona/Seraphine's music clutch Kai'sa's Peach Motif RELL'S HORSE NOTEBOOK (?!?) I need help seeing this one Allusion to Syndra's Prestige with the golden orbs  Roof Lux with Ahri necklace  I didn't see anything associated with Ekko. Unless the golden orbs on the teacher's desk are supposed to also represent time. So then it would represent both Ekko's and Syndra's prestige.
Im gonna cry! 🥹🥹🥹
Ah yes. my favourite anime.
누가봐도 세라핀
0:14 Rakan & Xayah Reference 0:17 Is that Akali's?
So Jinx and Lux are finally gonna makeout this time, right?  Like, throughout all the Star Guardian Lore, the two have been practically canon, so just make it happen already.  We're in the right month even.
Hope this means we are getting a new game mode
AYAYA Clap
I love this
This is why they need to make an anime
GIVE US A ANIME PLEASE
Makoto Shinkai is that you?
Once again Riot, MAKE AN ANIME OUT OF THIS XD, man the atmosphere is so good.
the animation is beautiful!! wish they make a anime episode with this <3
Just one..  Goosebumps
Hello?! where's our full on anime riot??
Yeah it looks good and all but can i have a pve mode where i can massacre AI with my friends ty
The animation is similar to those of studio ghibli, the soundtrack too, I loved it! <3
There’s something about this teaser that gives me the feeling of nostalgia, of tender & sweet moments, of memories lost & shared. I’m so excited for Riot to continue expanding this universe- I can’t wait for July 14th!
No one thinks that this looks like makoto shinkai's animation? Your name?
🤮🤢🤮🤢
Looks like a Makoto Shinkai animation
I have lots of cherished memories intertwined with this particular skinline and its PVE event ,  hope riot helps me relive them again  *crosses fingers for pve co-op*
ily
RELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh
I'm so hyped, thank you for bringing this back Riot! 😭✌️
Definitely inspired by to makato shinkai’s work
art, animation and music team never dissappoint
This animation is nothing less than beautiful
Porter Robinson ?!??!!!!
amooooo
League anime when lol
RIOT always ...
Porter Robinson Mentioned in the Description 👀
omg yesssssss
wow
dam i was hoping to see sg gragi
this is literally the reason that's keeping me going
Is PvE back!?!?
Insane animation to see in 4K
LET'S GOOOOO!
Ayy, and this trailer just came out on my birthday ^ . ^
I was really waiting for the Void Event, but if this is a PvE event, I can wait for as long as it's needed. Star Guardians is a really cool alternative universe for League, so exploring more of it is always welcomed. Besides, if Void Event NEEDS time, at least they're giving us something. And I'm sure we want a good and well-organized Void Event. Ruination was cool, but... a bit underwhelming and sort of a mess...
Where is urgot
This makes my heart so happy <3
The star guardian gamemode better come back
every second is wallpaper worthy ;_;
You can hear Valor at 0:24. Exact same sound when you press R in game
thank you for blessing my eyes <3
Am ready
is that seraphine or kaisa???
dose this mean riots gona make an ACTUAL EVENT FOR ONCE?! its only been YEARS  O<O
wth? this is some A-1 pictures type of animation HOLY riot be doing the most
with star gradian urgot already a thing, I petition there to be a star gradian garages
If we could get another song along the level of the last Star Guardian skinline song, light and shadow I think was the name, I'll be ecstatic
so we getting a star guardian anime or not?
Your name - feat. League of Legends
very good note 2
This is what happens when animators get paid
*PLEASE GIVE US A CORRUPTED STAR MORGANA*
i literally just peed myself a little tbh
nut nut nut nut nut....
kaisa.100%
LETS GOOOOO
Yet another event.  PLEASE MAKE IT PVE AND NOT RUINATION
absolutely stunning animations as always. Riots got one of the absolute best animation teams in the world
Please we need to thanks all people who worked on this. Please search about 'em. There's a lot of credits in the description.   Thank you so much to all.
Porter? 👀
Beautiful japan scenery 😍
That *Genshin* font tho 😘
PVE??   ??
Where's my void event?
Your Name ?
This reminded me that iv been saying I was hoping for a start guardian event to return and now I realize I was mistaken.. it was space Odyssey
00:22 is that soraka's cafe?
I love ✨💓
THE ANIMATION!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYTIME IT JUST GETS BETTER AND IM HERE FOR IT!! :D
imagine a literal anime for this. lmao. cmon rito pls
bigger budget than seven deadly sins s3
Theres a Riot logo at 0:25 implying that Riot exists in the Star Guardian Universe. Does that mean League of Legends exists there too? So can Lux play Star Guardian Lux?
PORTER ROBINSON IN THE DESCRIPTION?
Star Guardian Nilah confirmed?
Well that was extremely pleasant to look at
Yeeeeeeeeees i was waiting for to long >:D
Lux >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> perfeitaaaaaaaaa
ANIME WHEN? RIOT PLZ
Can't wait for the music!!! Light and shadow is one of my favorite musics of all times even today. I'm surely not getting disappointed, right Rito Gomes?
Cool how they teased some of the champs. Can't wait to see how Oriana turns out.
[속보] 리그오브레전드 시네마틱 팀, "애니메이션 업계 진출 임박"
Maybe this is the seraphine SG pasive sound, you know, the music room, with microphone, partiture *-*
Porter Robinson in the credits? O.o!
Katarina, yeah?
오우 쉣.. 쥬지가 웅장해진다
Star guardian Kaisa, Star Guardian Kaisa, Star Guardian Kaisa, Star Guradian Kaisa.  *inhale*  STAR GUARDIAN KAISA!!!

If feels like you see an Anime riot have go insane lately in their videos
Nice video
This 100% looks like an anime teaser trailer   thats just how good it is
So battle academia, star guardian and cafe cuties are part of the same universe ?
I hope we will get SG Anime or something like Arcane.
Star Gardian Aatroxx,  when riot ???
PORTER ROBINSON???
This reminds me of the anime "Your Name" and "Weathering with You" for some reason.
😍😍😍😍
The animation here gives me _"Your Name"_ vibes.
okay riot, here me out. you can make an entire anime out of staar guardian.
Star Guardian Anime WHEN?
we need a Star Guardian anime!
- How many times you reviewed this? - Yes.
I got chills EVERYWHERE 😍
The Shinkai Makoto' artstyle tho 🥵🥵🥵
BANGER
give us actual star guardian urgot, cmon now
theres another music vid for this event right? Pleassee yes.. i loved the last one
Riot make an anime of this
other games: collab with an anime Rito: Fine, I'll do it myself
Soooo... I've asked this years ago, but why exactly is this not a manga and/or anime yet? Like, you have the money, you obviously have very talented animators and artists and you've got the fanbase who'd not only love to watch/read this, but who would be up for spending money on it (myself included). Very beautiful teaser <3
i'm completely obsessed!! i've been waiting for so long, can´t believe its actually here >_<
That's kaisa right
YES YES YES YES CMON OWWWO *_______________________________* THANK YOU RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Smooth AF
cringe

Це п'яте пришестя Зіркових Захисників О_О
Makoto Shinkai vibes

Employee: "let's make something new and different" Riot: "you're fired"
They forgot the T
I’m hoping the game mode comes out again!! I’m so hyped

I can feels the 5cm persecond here
Интересно, очень интересно

RIOT EU JURO QUE SE VCS FI\ZERAM SERAPHINE STAR GUARDIAN E NÃO COLOCARAM A SONA, A GENTE VAI TER UM PROBLEMA SERISSÍMOOOOOOOOOOO
So this is suppose to be Japan obviously so it makes even less sense to have Rell as a champ in the series.
PVE PLEASE
빨간대가리 세라핑핑이만 아니길
OMGGGG THIS LOOKS AMAZINGGG RIOT NEVER DISAPPOINTES I'M SO EXCITED FOR SERAPHINE💗💗💗💖
а когда скины пентакил

Porter Robinson are you KIDDING ME
Was that a genshin impact trailer?
Okay I'm clueless. Who's the champ at the end? Is it Lux?
Liminal places
0:20 this dripping flower is the ultimate represenatation of star guardian. btw the music is very nice, for lack of a better description.

Still waiting to what happened to Ahri.
This looks like my little Pony but in future
star guardian seraphine???
OMG OMG OMG ITS SO PRETTY IM GONNA CRY I LOVE THIS SM
Please bring back ascension mode (xerath in the middle), it was amazing mode and very fun.  Star guardian PVE aswell, It was very challenging and gave very good feeling of victory, odyssey aswell. Ascension and star guardian modes were my favorite.
Arcane looks a little different now
Please let urgot be a real star guardian
This is some HQ crack. I love it.
Porter Robinson?? I see him lurking in the description
Makoto Shinkai's influence I guess
AI PAPITO
Arrumar o jogo não quer né?
oh my god is the gamemode coming back???
I NEEEED IT
You know, it says event teaser; but I find myself wanting it to be the next Nexflix series.
씹덕겜 다됐노 ㄹㅇㅋㅋ
This looks like it would be an anime like 'Your Name' or 'A Silent Voice'. The animatikn is very pretty and smooth
Is it just me, or do the stars look like primogems from Genshin?
All new champ trailers are insulted by these high quality event trailers, and i don't like it
I NEED A 10 MIN CINEMATIC ON THIS PLS!!!!
PLEASE GIVE ME A STAR GUARDIAN SERAPHINE IN PC

Star Guardian Quinn?
I hope soooo hard that it is kata !!

Arcane was a hit, so Riot said “Lets lean heavier into the anime themes”

I wonder if we'll get cool champs further on
ахуеть
DOKI DOKI Star Guardian 🌟
FINALLY
Kai'saaaaaaa i love uuuuu
so,we get ANOTHER anime type event but no Void event? Shame on you Riot
DONDE ESTA AHRI?!!!
Makoto Shinkai vibes, so calming.
Bring back the star guardian event map and then we will talk.
"Your Name" vibes here
0:30 is that Kai'Sa, Rell and Akali on the locker?
Riot Should make more anime. I'd watch Star Guardian as a show.
Yessss.
이게 무슨 별수호자야 느낌이 딱 영혼의 꽃 아리인데
Anime.
Why don't we get a starguardian anime?
This isnt a game trailer, this is what Riot needs to work on after Arcane is done. A Star Guardian anime is something the Lol community needs.
0:29  Rell, Kai'sa and Akali (?) on the photo
your name vibes
If you watch carefully you can see a lot of information, like Akali teased in one of the desks in the classroom (as well as Seraphine)
SLAYYYYYYY OMG
me recordó el intro de proJect diva xD
I was in peace for 0:59 min
So many bots in the comments... And bots who like too dayum
Absolutely gorgeous
I better see star garden urgot or there’s going to be some issues
This entire thing just reminds me of Genshin Impact.
Look forward to seeing my SG Sona ☺️
YAYAYAYAYYA
anyone see the scuttle haha
Riot current animation quality give me the goosebumps I used to get when I watched the old blizzard expansion trailers, such as wotlk
Star guardian !! <3 <3 <3
AAAAAA
AYAYA
шо за аниме
every frame has HD wallpaper potential.
League champions in a shounen generic japanese highschool with flustered male champions that have 8th grade syndrome and female champion that are generic idols, lol.
Is this the new Hololive alternative trailer or did i get lost?
League of Legends ft. Makoto Shinkai
I was listening to Collective Conscious while watching this and it made it infinitely better.
I am waiting for an anime series about it. The animation looks so good! Wow.
linda a lux
FINALMENTE, EU ESPERO ELAS DESDE A LUX, DESDE OS CONTOS, DESDE O QUIZ PRA SABER QUEM EU SERIA.....FINALMENTE MAIS UM CAPITULOOOO
Please be PVE please be PVE
Man i missed Star Guardian so much
I'm so in love with this teaser! Too eager! I loved the padlock with Rakan's and Xayah's feathers, remembering the Louvre bridge in Paris that tourists who were going to visit there began to put padlocks, symbolizing the eternal love of couples. 0:14
If Valoran is really back, please back with the Invasion Mode too 😭😭😭
응~ 페이커가 울면서 호소해도 듣는 척도 안하는 개똥망게임 버리고 저 기간동안은 갓겜 메이플 할거야~ ㅗㅗ
I need this anime.
Ayo???
MAKE AN ANIME ALREADY (yes ik down bad etc but srly look at this)
absolutely gorgeous thematically and visually.
Change your Balance team, and u'll be perfect Riotgames but I guess nothing is perfect..
This music reminds me a lot of Luma Pools from Ori and the Will of the Wisps! Especially the very colorful piano chords at the beginning! :O
STAR GUARDIAN FIDDLESTICKS
THEY ARE FINALLY BACK!! I MISS STAR GUARDIAN TT. PLEASE BRING BACK THE EVENT TOO TT
Когда Удир, м?
F HI SK HEYUUDHDBX637OW ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!? I've waited every year in hopes of seeing Star Guardian again and it's coming back right when I'm moving to another country (13th of July) and won't have my computer?!? WHYYYYYY??????????? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. The tears are real right now, those are not emojis
Looking like a more-saturated Makoto Shinkai trailer
Riot never make me disappointed by making films... Except 200 yrs of collective game design
MAAAAAN YEAH JAPAN
별수호자 오른 제발...!
It just can't get more weeaboo than this
Here we go again...
Was that a picture of ekko in that locker??? 🥰
WE WON GORLSSS
Pls bring something good like you bring hiroyuki sawano into the theme before
Take my moneyyyyyy
....Why do i got the feeling that Riot will someday made an anime series
Clearly star guardian taric.
what in the shoujo is this?   (love this btw)
you better give us an event game mode like the first guardian event. Jesus i waited so long for a new game mode.
Well ok then
So... how bout that league anime :^)
Makoto Shinkai, it's you?
OMG OMG OMG OMG
YAY!! Star Guardian is back!!! And I hope Ahri gets to be apart of it!!!
This is making me cry idk why, started playing league coz of the star guardians
make a anime please.
please taric
the animation in this teaser is just on another level it makes me want to cry!
YESSSS FINALLY!!!❤️🤩
자물쇠 디테일 뭐냐고 시발ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
PVE event looking at the trailer:   Is for me? 👉 👈
I'm inlove
Love the amount of effort they put into teaser but I'm so tired of Star guardian thematic......
sg katarina pls
Long Time No See
I'm crying of emotion for this moment, my girls are comeback 🥰
lazy pigs talentless riot just makes another company to make this amazing quality short while they pay them a penny while milking all of the money from this themselves
Is seraphine
guys 0:43 is Lux. If you look closely she has purple eyes when Kaisa eyes are red. Riot already stated lux and ahri getting updated so this must be it.
This gave me mad anime vibes but with super detailed animation........ Godamnnnnnnnnn!

I'm literally crying rn

Legends of Runeterra as well? Noice
IM SO EXCITED
Dear Riot, give us the full Star Guardian anime already, please. It's pretty much a guaranteed hit.
Yassss

çok tatlı olmuş
I want a star guardians show in this beautiful style so bad!
Please please please......  I want to see Urgot somewhere.... (as headmaster would be cool)
So you ain't showing us how they defeated Zoe and save Xayah, I mean, we all know but would be nice if they show it on a cinematic
YO it starts after my birthday!
Meu deeeeeeus✨🌙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Wait what, the art and the city concept look like Japan but there is a symbol of Shanghai, why?
How amazing an anime looking like this with a schoolgirl/star guardian theme in the lol universe would be!
Eu te amo riot games
Pls Seraphine on Pc
PLEASE NERF AKALI
There needs to be a Star Guardian anime... Please, Riot, make it happen!
Every frame can be a wallpaper in this teaser
Omg , the art style is amazing
This is incredibly GORGEOUS!
WE WANT THE PVE MODE, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
It's Udyr the last frame, isn't it ?
The most exciting things about star guardian are the visual and the song, they'll surprise us with a good soundtrack and i can't wait for it!!!!
Please bring Star guardian Seraphine to LoL, can’t be just Wild rift exclusive :((
我超，二次元
C'mon riot hire the soundtrack god Hiroyuki Sawano
아니 뭐 신카이 마코토 데리고 왔음??
What good animation, this is 90% static backgrounds lmao
Are we going to get the pve mode back?
YEEEEEES, YEEEEEESSSS. PLEASE let it be a long cinematic like you did with spirit blossom, PLEEEEASEEE.
Wait, Porter Robinson?
LOve Star Gurdian Theme
Xayah and Rakan's lock... :(
OMFG OMFG OMFG ITS HAPPENING
Star Guardian Taric plz
The trailer for the new Makoto Shinkai movie looks good
insane quality
Where's jett and phoenix
I don't care much for star guardian but this looks absolutely stunning. Props to the animation team, every frame is wallpaper worthy.
I'm surprised this isn't a full fledge anime apart from Arcane.
Can't wait for big bad baddie fiddlesticks!!! Awoooooo
Where’s our seraphine star g she is so perfect for this…
hol' on hol' on... Kimi no Nawa?
Lets gooooo
INVASION PLEASE
Just shut down the servers already.
Spørgt
The nostalgia feels omg

Return to valorant city?
im crying
kai'sa ?
I love japanese concept like this 💘  Please give me a star guardian galio!!!!
Iboove the animation💖💖💖😍😍😍
weeb time I love it lulw
Ahri turning with all the emotional drama of Kaori Miyazono and all the nostalgia of Fruits Basket made me feel some kind of way.
Soooo prettyyyyyy
0:15 imagine if it showed E + J for the timebomb fans
Interesting that Legend of Runeterra gets included in this too! It's a really solid PVE card game that doesn't get enough love.
Vex 😭
ET ÇA SORT LE 14 JUILLET LEEEETS GOOOO.
GIVE US STARGUARDIAN SION
really hoping we get a star guardian Leona and Diana, i mean they are literally made for this stuff
I dunno why, but this reminds me of the tsukihime remake opening.
I don't know what this will be and I'm already sold on it. Such perfection and beauty
Make this an anime plz
Dang. The quality. 🔥
faz um anime disso ❤️
Now this could be a bait to make us think the event has PVE, we should keep our heads cool.
I'd watch this anime
RIOT ANIME WHEN?
[*] RIP Void event  ,, You were never ment to be and while only small portion of comunity which were people that overdosed copium after Listening to Necrit and other content creators failed Dreams of Riot actually carring about lore fans and Narrative team, you will never be remembered XD get rekt by money from anime "- 21.06.2022-21.06.2022
*its been around 6 years and still no star guardian urgot...*
Anime? When?
Seraphine?
I HOPE IT COME WITH THE NEW LOR CARDS
At this point I'm just sad. There's at least like 10 different animes that riot could have done by now q.q.
please make anime
I love how you can see xayah and rakan feathers seal on the lock
shinkai vibes
x fin un evento pve al nivel de los 2 anteriores que fueron epicardos????
me and the boys waiting for a void event:*sad nerd voice* but really cool teaser btw :')
what is called that text style?
That looks IN-CREDIBLE!!
who is the character on the roof 0:41 ?
Omg finally Starguardian Seraphine!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I cant believe this summer event wont be a canon one, i was really hoping for the void event this is just extremely dissapointing. At least the animation is gorgeous and it might be a really cool event probably with the return of the pve mode but still. If riot decided to shift to alternative universes just so if they mess up the event people wont be mad because it is not canon it will be sad.
This reminded me of your name (Kimi no na wa)
i'm shaking, rosana
plz no akali
My only complain is that its kaisa trailer rll nice tho
why do anime girls love school roofs seriously
Petition for Rito to bring out an anime:
Pray For Star Guardian Sona
THANK GOD OYU GUYS ARE DOIN GTHIS RELEASE 43 NEW CHAMPS BEFORE 2023 PLEASEEEEE!!!
🕯️🕯️Manifesting for invasion mode comeback 🕯️🕯️
Go on Riot, don’t be shy make a 5 season anime with this go on go on
Every single frame is wallpaper worthy. So hyped for this event!
Anime
wonder who the chick is in the teaser
Looking forward to this anime :)
IS THAT SERAPHINE AT THE END??? I see all of the music hints + the mic :O
katarina star guardian !
We want old soraka! And old Taric!
I'm so hyped you can't even imagine
Riot make an anime already
_ahaha... _*_SG Seraphine WR EXCLUSIVE_* 🤪
La animación 🤤🤤🤤
PERFECTION! <3
JUST MAKE AN ANIME ALREADY!!! I WANT IT SO BAD
This looks like something from Makoto Shinkai. And holy moly why is Porter Robinson's website in description, has he something with this project???  Edit: This really gives "Shelter" vibes, Porter has to have something with this event!
Another anime
IT'S BEEN 3000 YEARS
Wait, are Lux and Jinx a thing in SG? Am I late to this realization?
Ah yes the teaser for the league anime we will never get
AYAYA
This is absolutely beautiful. Remind me of five centimeter per second.
b bu but but....where is the void event?
I am sooooo waiting something about Xayah and Rakaan
Riot, I think you forgot the T😂
LETS LOSE SOME RP LEGGO
hi leued     of leaunds good like it best looks good cool like it that good like it  like see video good like it yass looks good
Kaisa? Her star has a pair of wings... So probably kaisa??
AS AN ANIMATOR AND DIGITAL ARTIST I MIGHT SAY THAT THE DETAILS AND ARTSTYLE OF THIS VIDEO IS VERY BRILLIANT TO SEE ✨❤️
thats star guardian kat i swear
Plssssssssss PVE events, they were so fun, way better when braindead urf.
This looks like a combination of Star Guardian and Battle Academia. Really glad that SG are coming back, one of the best themes in League by far. The animation is so good as well.
So pretty, this animation hits really hard
could this be a future anime serie ?
MANOOOOOOOOOOO 😍😍😍😍😍
cant wait to see my favorite star guardian *Urgot*
Can't wait to see Akali and Rell star guardian
serra my love
Is valoran(t)
still waiting udyr rework 😭
Zzzzz
Please don't make Seraphine a Wild Rift exclusive.
This is quite an eargasm.
Тизер какого-то аниме нового?
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS DAY FOR SUCH A LONG TIME FINIALLY :]]
Star Guardian mordekaiser pls
This year of league has prob been one of the most boring/confusing
Это так красиво....Скорее бы уже...
Plz don’t give wildrift players hope, we know we will not have kaisa :’)
Katarina?
KAISA 🥰🥰🥰🥰
KAISAAAAAAAAA <3 <3
Johnny dyr next? 👀
First valorant now this we’re being fed riot we’re being fed
Monika?
Skyen gonna go nuts with this
league of legends has just become a weeaboo circle jerk at this point
Oh god it's happening-
Budget for animation of Nilah: $2.73 dls Budget for animation Star guardians presentation: $176847 dls
All the references to past guardians and old guardians together is just amazing.
MAKOTO SHINKAI IS THAT YOU???
*frissons*
And when u gonna fix the scripts and the balance of the game?
Channeling pve event.
just give us the anime riot. Ya know we want it
LOVED the Doombots and the star guardian's modes i hope riot include them as mini games one day
omg
Not gonna lie every frames from this teaser trailer can be put as a wallpaper, stunning visuals as always Riot!
The animation is *MINDBLOWING*
Wait isn't this the animation for that lux doujin with Jayce and Ezreal? Wow they're making an anime out of that with new characters? Cant wait!!
I created a wallpaper with wallpaper engine, search for the same title to find it.
This looks like the backgrounds for some romance anime movie
Sonaaa <3
please tell me there's another game mode
Headphones in, tears out.
Can it be Star Guardian Katarina??? Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!! Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!! Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!! Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!! Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!! Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!! Give me Star Guardian Katarina!!!
Omg now this looks like Anime. Great work
Take my money now
I'm not exaggerating, this animation gave me goosebumps, just 10/10.
Star Guardian skinline is nothing without PVE, just a bunch of dressed girls without villains.
как будто аниме выходит новое
Stunning animation ahhh i just really really wish this would be back with PvE event again like i miss it so much come on
You deserve an anime now, right ? :)
How to stop rewatching that masterpiece?
What did Porter Robinson do? :o
Alright here comes the Lux mains trying to make the event all about Lux.
Star guardian anime when
pls be pve or at least nexus blitz
I have been waiting for this for sooooo long !!!!
I can't believe they've hired Makoto Shinkai for Season 4...
Doki Doki Literature club
boring
Lots of references that I prob cant tell so I'll just wait for that necrit video...
The trailer: epic, beautiful The event: [destroy the enemy nexus five times] type of mission
The vibes 😭 omg
RIOT pls we are begging bring back pve and other game modes we like them we really do it's a break from the monotonous grind of rift and aram and tbh even urf is starting to get boring pls it's been so long since we've had a proper event
where rell
0:43 lux? eyes purple
I love the animations!!
What a soothing teaser... Riot surely never disappoints when the subject is animation
AINT NO WAY ITS COMING BACK BOIS
I'm calling it right now, jinx route will be the best routev
I thought this was anime movie teaser lol
We need another star guardian game mode
We need an anime of this!! 💜
:O
0:30 are those Ekko and Jinx? :O
I wont returns, never. I'll cherish the last bit of my sanity
Lets all hope there will be no Wild Rift Exclusive Content (plz dont let sera be wr exclusiv u make more money if not)
the owner of the game spell the name of the game wrong
Крутотень! Крутотенюшка!
Dont you dare riot, to make SG Seraphine WR only
PvE MODE PLZ ;-;
Burning bright!!
THANK YOU RIOT! At long last...
PVE???
Im re-living my sailor moon childhood nostagia with my favorite in game characters now. thank you so much <3
Riot Should make a Star guardian Series in Netflix
Urgot. That's all I have to say. Ladies and gentlemen... Urgot.
ok but what if: events with actual sick pve game modes and not just a "complete 1 game to get 1 token" quests? You guys make a lot of money. Please do something back for the community.
It comes out on my birthday!!!
This teaser makes it look like SG will have a visual novel game
Только не БП, Только не БП, Только не БП, Только не БП, Только не БП, Только не БП.... Умоляю что-угодно, но не БП.
Hoping to one day release Star Guardian anime and battle academy
finally star guardian long time no see baby
This is AMAZING!
아싸
i want the league i remember back
Wtf this art
Riot legitimately has a collection of the greatest animators and artists.
JUST TAKE MY MONEY
라이엇 이쪽에 진심이네
that looks straight like an anime trailer.   pls just one episode
This video title sounds like a clickbait. This better be an event with more than just completing a few missions.
Why is Porter Robinson credited in the description?!
Pls tell me that will be an animation series!
HOW IS NO ONE NOTICING PORTER ROBINSON BEING LINKED IN THE DESCRIPTION?!?!?!?!?!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hype
I hope that is a new game, not a PVE event.
Ok but Why Star Guardian
Each scene is for each champion ! Beautiful Teaser ! <3
but no void event huh?
I'm in love😍😍😍 need more💖
Oh i can't wait for this event! This is already looking amazing!
I Clicked because i saw valorant city
I have a question, are cafe cuties and battle academia in the same universe as SG?
what is the thing in the alleyway at 0:16 that's sitting in the darkness blinking
So I guess that means we won’t get a void event then
I literally got shivers all over my body
Are you guys planning to make a star guardian series on netflix???
Is it...shyvana? no, right? I just thought of her because the school crest (?) is a dragon
please have good event writers this time, fingers crossed
would be a good anime opening
Omfg star guardian shyvanna I’m reaaaaady
Reminds me of CoMix Wave animation style. Its so good
chills man...
ah yes back to where it began now if only we can get the og song back
待ってた
make syndra a villain
i believe i quote TBSkyen when i say “MAKE THE ANIME ALREADY”
Please make an anime of the Star Guardians 😭😭😭😭 pleaaaaseeeeee
This is so heavenly T^T
00:15 quem será q é aql coelho no escuro? Deve ser MT fofow
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
This animation is awesome!
dude wth this teaser is amazing,, but knowing Riot, I’ll keep my expectations low
Anyone else wish Riot would drop an entire star guardian themed anime?
come on ... new anime series?? give us
Finalmente um evento divertido e não só speel book urf spell book urf
“ 씹덕은 돈이 된다 “
YAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYSSSS!!!!!!!
So cool , so professional
No
Finally league bringing the weeb event back. It's been years since the last star guardian
Event teaser? Oh well, too bad I uninstalled league months ago, props to the animation team though, as always.
I guess that means that we're not getting a void event, huh, (sniff), I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING! 😢😭
sona ????
I CAN'T WAIT PLEASE PLEASE PLEAE
So my question is though what happened to this void event everyone was talking about
This is why I still love Riot. You don't need to like League to enjoy all the universes and art. So beautiful, and km so happy to see another event!!
I love you, Riot!!! Thanks for it!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
finally the only thing I've looked forward to this season
There’s something about this teaser that gives me the feeling of nostalgia, of tender & sweet moments, of memories lost & shared. I’m so excited for Riot to continue expanding this universe- I can’t wait for July 14th!
The animation is giving me a mixed vibe of Studio Ghibli and Your Name vibes. It's so good it's giving me chills and teary-eyes.
What we really want is the Invasion (Star Guardian Event) way back 2017. We want it back. Is it too much too ask for?
Looks like the op of a visual novel.
OMG SIIIII KAI'SA GUARDIANA ESTELAR! ❤️💓💥
Please make that anime  “ Star Guardians “ amazing concept beautiful animation and soundtrack and already have perfect story but with Japanese voice over and English subtitles can be gorgeous ^^ riot pleaseeee :)
.
this kinda reminds me of weathering with you and your name. it has that certain vibe to it.
Where fiddlesticks
why cant riot games be an animation studio?
Netflix or whatever, plz. Thanks, daddy Riot.
Urgot is coming back!
These artworks are incredible.
Cool and detailed animation. What a shame that this so-called "event" is just going to be a bunch of boring missions. Hard to be excited about any event they tease anymore, ever since they decided to degrade them. Hopefully I'm wrong and they add something else (aside from .pngs talking to each other)
So when is this beautiful anime coming? I know this is just an event but I would love side content stories.
Here's hoping for another light and shadow. But with Kai'sa and Akali in it.
netflix series when??
Okay, I need a league inspired high school anime 🥺😍✨🤩 The details in this teaser are too good😭
Ihope gwen is here
So hyped for this! I'm not sure if the girl at the end is supposed lux with her hair down or if its the new upcoming starguardian champ
Yesss, bring back the star guardian pve gamemoooode
I'M NOT READY I REPEAT I'M NOT READY FOR THIS
This better not be another event with "talk to this character" kinda vibe. We want the great return of star odyssey etc
It's cool and all but... where's the Void Event? :( I feel like it has been completely tossed to the side...
that's extremely pretty!!
*Mappa studio :”Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary”*
Don't be fooled PVE is dead
Is it going to be an actual "Event" or is it just another pointless grind fest?
Aiiii meu c* riot
IS THAT....  SERAPHINE?🤔🤔
THE ANIMATIONS ARE SO SOLID! COME ON RIOT! RELEASE AN ANIME ALREADY!
PVE?
Sooooo star guardian nilah confirmed? Also please please please let this be a PVE event
Riot Anime when?
I START STREAMING 24/7 its wonderful ! STAR GUARDIAN IN MY HEART
I want it as a new anime series 💖
so... Melancholy of Ahri Suzumiya?
My RP is ready ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
B-but... muh Void event 😥
Every frames can be my wallpaper I wonder if there are any other videos like this one
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS TY RIOT I CANT WAITTTTT
If star guardian Urgot doesn't make a cameo I'm going to start burning things.
Looks like a new teaser for their upcoming animated series revolving around Lux!
god please, not seraphine, not seraphine
IT'S HAPPENEING EVERYONE CALM DOWN😱😱😱
MY HANDS ARE SHAKİNG
The darkest nights, makes for the brightest stars 💖 I MISSED THIS SKINLINE SO BADDDD
League Anime When
*♡♡♡*
Every frame in this video could potentially be a background... so beautiful
....so Urgot?
There is gonna be a star guardian seraphine, definitely
Is this Kai'sa or Katarina? Or is it Lux with her hair out of pigtails? It has to be the leader of a squad I'm sure, whoever it is.... Pretty sure it's Kaisa though.
legends of runeterra event about star guardian. NICE
For a moment, I think it's a  anime movie trailer.
AHHHH ESTOY MAS EMOCIONADA QUE LA CRESTA
The girl is Kai'Sa <3
I suddenly want to study in a school like this in Japan. And yes SG Sona is finally coming!
1000
NICE.  ANOTHER VIDEO🙂
One of the best story´s in the game!
Is this the long awaited reveal of the new 20 ban system?
So wow, like a Makoto sensei work
League of anime, haha.
Wonder if they bring back the Star Guardian Ahri announcer with this 🤔
Battle academy TAHM KENCH
Lol, Star Guardian is going live the same day France celebrates its national day
It's so beautiful ✨❤
This just lightened my heart so much! We have missed Invasion and PvE modes so much. SG <3
The dragon symbol on her clothes...
Shivana new star guardian?
MAKOTO SHINKAI, IS THAT YOU?
please bring back gamemodes like odyssey or star guardian please
full anime of this PLEASE
I'm hyped so much, hope the mode PVE "return to Valoran City" too..
Very beautiful animation. A lot of details you can't catch with just watching it once. The style reminds of of the Ghibli movies.
please normal event with new map , not only money !!!!
0:17 omg even the "enemy missing" ping is featured in the video (on the newspaper)
ITS HAPPENING GUYS ITS HAPPENING
OMG WHERE IS NAMI??!?
Kirei dana~~~
Riot, make a damm movie already  Don’t talk, just shut up, take my money and use it to make a movie    NOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!
Wow Star guardians 😍😍
Pls give us PvE on League
last time we got such an animation was some years ago and we got an event as well,will there be an event finally? or should i lower my hopes?...
Dude that's amazing
yo new star guardian game mode? lets go!!!
Sawano returns 👀?
Please bring invasion game mode back.
Pretty video, but nothing of substance. A true tease I guess.
League of legends finally got an Anime series?!?
anime doko?
Avistei referência a Sona ali
Pls just make an anime already 🤣
This looks something from a makoto shinkai movie
The sad thing is that these background scenes with no characters already rock harder than most animations i've seen
Please bring back pve game modes aaaaaaaaaaa
New star guardian event?
ofcourse its sersphine😏😏
Забыли Т в слове Валоран
I‘m a huge riot game fan, especially and firstly of your art! That must be an amazing team behind it <3

Necesito colaboración con Pandora, quiero charms de las guardianas, lo necesito 🤯🤯🤯
I don't care if this event end up bad, the nostalgia already filled up my dopamine level
0:29 is that rell and akali in the picture on the locker???
I hate that this looks better than most animes. And I love it
All animations about Star Guardians are beautiful. When I saw this in my recommendations remembered the Star Guardians 2017 when I started to play LOL, nostalgic.
YYYYYYYYYYYYYAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
if riot makes anything else except games its all gonna be top sellers games are top sellers as well , selling ur souls
씹덕은 돈이 된다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Is that Kat towards the end OOOOOOOO
Just Riot animation team teasing us that they can do an anime too.
The best thing I saw was that Legends of Runeterra logo Love it already
Is there an Anime that looks like this animation
petition to Bring back StarGuardian mode

YES YES YES YES FINALLY <3 THANK U RIOT
Can i ask when Animations Star guardians with twelve episodes? Hihi💯❤️ hope so
Riot, please tell me you've not kidnapped anyone from japan for this?
Idk why I read that as Valorant and was expecting some kind of Valorant cross over event.
ITS HAPPENING!! AND ON MY BIRTHDAY? WOOHOOOO
Are we going to get the game mode back?
It looks and sound so relaxing and cozy  Very beautiful trailer art/animation/concept tream
I really hope riot give it an anime series
I LOVE THIS VIDEO
Star Guardian Warwick?
nice... is a runeterra event to?
YESS
I do hope this time we have PVE again, sure some people like ranked, but what about casuals who just want some fun? Plus, people want to enjoy this gamemode again and some of them want to experience for the first time! Maybe this time it could play a bit like Odyssey, with the upgrades and now we have a even larger pool of champions!
New makoto shinkai just dropped
make this a series
cringe
omg valorant city
just collaborate with an anime studio and make us an anime already Rito. dont be shy, we know you want to

The Void Event will never going to happening T_T
AIIII QUE LINDOOOO
So, that level of art/animation/sound, and yet no anime?
YO WHY IS THERE A CREDIT TO PORTER ROBINSON?!
Ah yes, my favorite city, Valorant by Riot Games
🥺
POV: What the game could be if lol wasn't a shitgame
Star Guardian Gragas pls
Art
Just make a Star Guardian Anime series so I can watch it already
I love the Oriental-Pearl-Tower-inspired building, reminds me of my mother's hometown Shanghai <3
Star Guardian  Katarina ?
The soundtrack looks just like the last update on Seraphine’s Twitter, “To new horizons”. I love it so much 😍😍
Maravilhosoo
I might have to reinstall League just for Star Guardian now
VALORANT CITY LUL
Studio Ghibli vibes all over the place with this one. Beautiful
not pajama guardian but star guardian urgot is comming
I'VE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS, LET'S GOOO!!!
duma liên minh lại làm phim rồi. tao thích vai~ !!!
Rito plz tell me that you'll bring back start guardians PvE mode 🙄
return to monke
Give these people an anime studio already!
Jak nie będzie PvE trybu to zrobię ulta ryza pod fontannę.
Cool
Buff zed
Did YouTube just randomly recommend me a League of legends animation even though I don't play League of legends? Yes, yes they did
it's like an anime movie and even better
Wouldn't it be crazy if these guys made an anime😀
League of Legends in a dating simulation is this what it's supposed to be woah...
Pve or consequences
The Return of Star Guardian AU The Art Reminds me of Your Name, Weathering with You and some other anime...
pve pls
First we had the god Hiroyuki Sawano and now we get Porter Robinson? Star Guardian value is through the roof. The animation reminds me alot of Vanillaware games, but it's like you gave the studio full artworks to make vs having characters interact with them.
A riot me fez LGBT, alimentado e doutrinado
Just create an anime already
WHO WAS THAT Kai'sa or Lux? Super ping hair, can't tell
Official "EVENT" Teaser, Cant Wait
Reminded me of my high school days when I Binged watched a lot of Slice of Life animes high school. 😭😭 (K-On, Tora Dora, Shakugan no Shana, Yamato Nadeshiko, CLANNAD!!! etc.)
Pls, pls, pls, let this be a real Star guardian event!  Pls, this has to be a PVE event like the stars guardians some years ago! This is the moment to get something that feels like a real event :0
Meu deus tá acontecendo 🥺🥺🥺
YES
They better have a continuation of the last cinematic. Don't just let it hang there unresolved.
OMG!!!!! I CANT WAIT!!!!!!😍😍😍✨
Huh a star guardian event ? I’m glad but hope it doesn’t delay the void event if like 4 years
OMG OMG IT'S FINALLY HERE!!! OMG PERIOD. ATE THAT.
What anime is this
RIOT MAKES AN ANIME  BOTTOM TEXT
Valorant???!?!??
KAI'SA 💜🤩
Yes guys, this is a League of Legend trailer, the same game with Shaco and Scarner in it.
Please MORE star guardians! Time has come!
For a second I thought the lofi girl was going too pop up🤣

還以為是哪一部新動漫要出了
Ryze rework teaser?
Kai'sa?
PVE! PVE! PVE! PVE! PVE!  PVE is league with the toxicity diluted to 1% from 100% most of ur games wont be toxic everyone will try have fun and play with each other (even tho i never played lol pve bc im new thats what i understood from everyone who played pve)
SIIIII MALDITA SEA SIIII

SONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! <3
EU TÔ FORA DE MIM!!!!!
Wait, that is on my birthday. Pog
If pve pog
THE QUALITY🔥🔥🌹🌹
Hm, Star Guardian? So it’s still going on, huh? Interesting.
Please get star gyardian teemo
Star guardian katarina plz
Are we getting a Star Guardian album?!
We need a Starguardian anime series!! please riot make it happen.
I hope its not just missions, but a pve
Bro I can't wait for this anime to come out the manga was so good.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS ❤️❤️
If only the game itself got the same quality treatment like these animations...
OH MY GOD FINALLY
Soooo Beautifullll
Starguardian Kat confirmed?
Please tell me this means another PvE game mode. They said they wouldn't but this would be the best thing Riot could do to save their reputation somewhat.
omg beautiful
PvE ?
i'm so sick of this hamfisted anime china money pandering being injected into my traditionally western fantasy inspired game. go make an anime game instead.
Huh, rakan and xayah made a love lock.
Star Guardian is really potential. When I have seen the P/V of Ahri Star Guardian I realized the potential animations of this story. hope Riot will keep the art in the episodes instead of E2 2012 ver 2
MAS FINALMENTE AAAAAA
God I hope it's not Seraphine.
YESSSSSSSSSSS
PLZ give us a anime series of star guardian like arcane~~~~！！！！
THIS IS IT HUHUHU I HAVE WAITING FOR SO LONG
OMG, is it Kai'sa, I'm gessing it's Kai\'sa but I hope that it's actually Seraphine!
We Makoto Shinkai now bois!
OMG THE STAAAAR GUARDIAAANS COMEBACK😭😭😭😭
Cant wait for the 3rd kaisa prestige, oh and please dont forget to put the compulsory “have thr least thing to do with thr skinline” champ, like i hope we will get chogat or sion…
Still waiting for them to make this an anime series
It looks like an anime I'll be honest. I'm expecting to see Zoro there
FINALLY THE STAR GUARDIAN EVENT HAS RETURNED I CANT WAIT🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Omg
make more pve events Riot! you cowards! you made the pentakill love concert don't tell me you don't have the money for rescources!!   also. DARK STAR VELKOZ WHEN?!
PREPARE YOUR BUSSIES YALL RIOT IS SLAYING QUEENS AND SNATCHING WIGS JULY 14TH
This makes me want a Star Guardian Themed Anime movie
It's all great! I've been waiting for this moment since the return of the Star Guardians! Especially for Sona. Anyway music, animations and graphic are all amazing <3
Wow
riot nunca errou nas cinematics, mas no jogo. kkkk
Hallo Weabo Player
Yeeeeeeesssssss finally new star guardians 💕🌠💖🌟💖🌠💕
AI MEU CU
АААААААААААААААААААААААААА ПИЗДАТО
Here is an idea. Why don't they make an otome game based on the lives of the star guardians? All the characters are playable and they each have their own unique ending. Or if they ever want to make a talltale game. They got my money if they ever want to made that.
AYAYAAAAAA
We need a star gudian anime
lol gg anime
ancora anime...
crazy looking
Right on my birthday!!! Best bday present I could get
Oh my gosh, oh my goshhh. Stay calm is STAR GUARDIAN Gragas. Stay calm people.
Riot's cinematic videos never fade from time to time. Must always be able to amaze all the audience
I hope they continue the lore, and not just create a new separate story from the original. They might just put the spotlight onto this season's SG struggles, and leave out the previous ones from the lore.  According to in-game descriptions, Xayah was saved, and Rakan remained corrupted and they plan on saving him somehow.
Riot just point me with a gun and take my money, it's easier
void event looking kinda weird this year
why do i have visual novel vibes coming from this
SI METEN A SERAPHINE Y NO A SONA, AL GULAG.
for a second it looked like battle academia to me xD
Oooo I love this line 😭👍
your come back made me emotional T^T
Just make an Anime already lol
thats perfect animation
July 14 bruh
riot please we need you to make an anime about star guardians it's just too good to let up T^T I'll even personally raise money to help fund it if need be
"Look at the animation, look at the quality, look at the visual" "RIOT, WHAT WAS THATTT"
Nailed the atmosphere/mood. Always love new start guardian content
PvE please?
STAR GUARDIAN IS FINALLY BACK BABY
별수호자타릭이랑 이즈커플기원
Wow! So Makoto Shinkai vibes from this animation, but also so sweat! Love it s000 much! <3
I hope there are more boy star guardians this time, like Yone
Beautiful scenes
YAS me reading to come back to league lol. Then break again after...
You should make a movie of this rito
UWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH SAILOR MOON 3
Sailor Moon/Sakura Card Captors vibes.
Finally, the time has come! Almost three years passed from the last cinematic, but for us, the true fans of Star Guardians, it felt like four seasons. Riot, just shut up and take my money! 💰💰💰💰💰
Lux or Kai'Sa?
I miss so much the pve event.
Star guardians is one of the best themes in League of legends, period.
this is so pretty omg I can't wait! it would be so cool if we had a star guardian Netflix show like how he have arcane
The anime from Riot not Mappa Wit 👌
Disgusting
Soo uuuhh... Gamemode or nah?
This is an amazing trailer, but  take it this means no Void Event this summer :/
So incredibly excited!! Kai’sa looks so good with her long flowing hair 😍😍
For the love of god, just make an anime!
I mean I like LoL and all, but maybe consider making animated films/shows as a main thing? You clearly have enough talented people for that!
BRING PVE BACK
this is beautiful! i love the animation and everything! i can't wait!!
No void event! ;-;
So... when does the SG anime air :))
While everyone is appreciating how good the teaser is, I’m just here wondering who’s that girl at the end, is it Kai’sa?
what? Is this a real game studio?
Who singed there? It's very similar to Ori... or maby it's just a style...
riots animation: 15/10 riots game: 4/10
Wow, that building, that detail, I thought I am watching Shinkai Makoto new animation.
this is RITO sensei 🤣🤣🤣🤣
PORQUE NADIE ESTA HABLANDO DE QUE SE VE COMO GENSHIN IMPACT!!! La protogema al final, el estilo, loco se viene colaboracion con Genshin?
genshin impact trailer
So no void event. That’s cool, so where’s udyr at? That’s cool, so no void event I guess. That’s cool. How’s skaner’s update been going? That’s cool. new star Guardian event tho. Hopefully it’ll have PVE. Hahahaha it won’t :  ^)
If we learned something with Arcane is that a Star Guardian Anime could be possible.
Продам почку. Дорого. Ждала три года! И вот оно.
This new anime looks lit
Can’t wait for yet another visual novel mixed with repeated missions for an “event”
BORA PORRA GAROTINHAS DE ANIME TROCANDO PORRADA LETSGOOOOOOOOO
Riot animation team is better than Balancing team
ITS KATARINA?!?!?!
Bring viktor to wild rift please btw the graphics of this teaser is really outstanding and beautiful, really well done piece of art 😄👌💖
Did rito get Makoto Shinkai to do this?
Kaisa 先輩! 付き合ってください!

Riot, just announce a Star Guardian anime already. We all know it’s coming.
cant wait for darius star guardian
Ill be soo disapointed if its just another freacking event pass
japanimation?
VALORAN OR VALORANT??
If you watch closely at each shot, there are hints for many champs. For example the noodle soup on the bag at 0:36. Or the music notes on the pencil bag (also 0:36). I think you can imagine which champs those are ;)  Edit: I also really like the love for detail like the riot logo at the building at 0:25, as well as rakan xayal love lock at 0:13 or the star guardian mini figurine capsules at 0:20. There are many more, its just amazing!
whos that at the end? lux?
DID COMIX WAVE DO THIS ANIMATION? MAKOTO SHINKAI ANYONE?!
Is this Lux again?
Arcane Season 2 is about the Star Guardians storyline confirmed!
Xayah and Rakan Love Lock?
Hype for new Season of Star Guardians.   However, I'm more curious on why Porter's name has been linked in the description. Are we getting something similar to Shelter perhaps???
Every romcom anime has one of these scenes
sheeesshhh🥶🥶🥶
It's Kaisa men my ghad loved it 💙
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES FINALLY, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Star Guardian Trundle!!
So, when does this anime release?
did the star guardian game mode will return?

MOONTON IS WATCHING hehehe
star guardians will forever be my favourite event / skinline in this game istg
Looks like an ad for a visual novel

I want sg soraka in wild rift please
Xayah ve Rakan'ın yıldız muhafızı hikayesi aydınlatılsa hoş olur.. Neden yıldız muhafızı düşmanı oldular?
Mas obvio que es seraphine xD
WAIT 7.14 THATS THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY LMAO
Selalu keren,mantap riot
PVE Mode doko?
Why is Porter Robinson tagged in the description, i MUST know more. Where is he and what will he be doing for star guardians this year???
Goosebumps
So no void event?
When is an animated series on Star Guardian? I dream about it
Give us monster not anime refrences.
Soooo why is Porter Robinson linked in the description? Is this teasing something or did I just overlook something?
Yeees, its so lovely !
PLZ DONT BE SERAPHINE PLZ DONT BE SERAPHINE PLZ DONT BE SERAPHINE

Valorant pls
Ok Rito, *NOW MAKE AN ANIME!*
omg its amazing i wait so long of this time <3
gdzie sona xd
We need a star guardian anime plz riot
Let the story of xayah and rakan's starguard be brought to light
UwU
peaches are Kai’Sa’s favorite fruits ohhh such a detail😭😭😭😭
Watching this you wouldn't think this is the most toxic game in the world but don't be fooled you will lose braincells if you play it.
If you're weeb + League player. this is a big win
You could even do a series or movie with your skinline universes lol But how come your universe page lists sg, odysee and kda as alternate universes but not the eclipse one? (Because church vs witches??)
Dangg
AHHHHHHHHH
my aesthetic finally !! btw can u do a series for the new star guardian like maybe 1-8 episodes with 10-15 mins
Reminds me of that anime Nestlé Ad
It looks absolutely amazing! We need more series and Im hyped
Finaly, Neeko will be saved! More lore! More Neeko?
She looks more like Lux than Kai'Sa.
im finna bruh
thank you for all the wallpapers i'll get out of this
WELL RIOT, MY MONEY IS ALREADY GONE <3 Theory time: Could be Kai sa one of the new star guardians? There is a lot of peaches references during the video and in some photos you can see two people, one of them has purple hair.
Raspberry hair..purple eyes..is that my baby Xayah? Nobody has that hair color and Kai*sa s hair color is more bright pink! and doesnt have purple eyes
just, CHILLS
clearly we know what it was referenced on, and we like that <3
this is amazing teaser
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh oh my good, my dream is coming true 🌈💖✨❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Zzzz
Guys what is the name of this anime?
god do i hate anime garbage.
Star guardian seraphine pc pls
Почему это так прекрасно? БОЖЕ эта рисовка в моем сердечке ಥ_ಥ
seraphine?
Ok Riot you did a amazing animated show now its time to do a anime xD
Seraphine voice inside of the music is so amazing 👏 😍 🙌 💕
타노스가 휩쓸고가서 친구가없네...
OMG I CANT WAITTT 😭😭😭😭
PLEASE JUST MAKE AN ANIME ALREADY XD!!!!!!
Waiting for a riot made anime about star guardian
Is riot making a shinkai film or something?
is this a new anime coming out?
Just make an anime already, Riot.
Is that SG Kai'sa 👁️👄👁️
Больше похоже на боевую академию.
This is just aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Hats off to RIOT!
이건사야되
ojala hicieran una anime con una calidad asi xd, riot has algo para los que no se bañan xd, porfavor!!!
Still no star guardian taric
Wait I saw the Runeterra card game Icon. Please don't tell me we're getting a star Guardian event in Runeterra. Please
So much content for riot games games
Oh no, starguardian seraphine.
i. am. SO EXCITEEEEEEED. i love the star guardians. xayah n rakan's story makes me tear up n i  hope we get to see any updates on that
Whoever made this definitely stepped their graphicussy up
Yey
So...Star Guardian Braum right?
im actually going to cry LETS GOOO
Damn...I'd pay for an anime or movie with this kind of animation...eventhough I don't play anymore, events like this will always be one of the best things Riot does...n_n
plss Anime 😍
되게짧네 ㅅㅂ
Se a Syndra trabalhar aqui vou amar 0:24
Gosh I wish they made this something like Arcane. I'm a fan of sailor moon
it's timeessssssssss
This is so Sakura Card Captors 💗
It's so beautiful! I hope everyone was well compensated.
QUEREMOS SERAPHINE NO PC PELO AMOR DE DEUS RIOT, MEU NICK É SERAPHÏNE
STAR GURADIAN BEST UNIVERSE OF LOL
Yeaaaaaaaaaah Riot Entertainment
Anime diff
awesome! but who is this girl in trailer? xayah?
THIS IS PERFECT, I'M CRYING FINALLY 😭😭😭
felicidad!!!!
Soundtrack and animation make me think of a donghua.  I would like to see more of this animation T_T.
Amém 🛐
I hope that they won't waste Rakan in this new event. They should make him something like The Ancestor from DD.
The animation is on another level... 👊
They NEED to make a show out of this.
You can take Seraphine, roll it , and put her up your-
Hard to believe this trailer is for a skinline from a game called League of Legends smh
the polaroid film has kai'sa, rell and akali on it :'>
i wanna live there 🥺
its illegal to have this clean animation visuals
Omgfg i never experienced a SG event, bcs i arrived on lol after the last, and i really excited to be in this fantastic universe aaaahhh
Riot starting to make visual novel game.
You know, for years I called Blizzard the king of cinematics.  Not gonna lie, they've fallen off.  Between Riot and Square Enix's Business Unit Three (Final Fantasy XIV), they've taken over.
Ayayayayayayayayayaya
NERF DIVINE SUNDERER.  REMOVE OBJECTIVE BOUNTIES.
lol how many star guardian things is riot gonna make...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wonder if the unconfirmed leaks are true, hopefully it does, I heard we will have Star Guardian Morgana, hoping also to have a Pure Star Guardian Kayle too but maybe as Corrupted Star Guardian instead like with Zoey's case!!
this is absolutely insane
FINALLY
Star guardian katarina
did i just watch a trailer for an upcoming anime?
you know what i want. KyoAni and League Star Guardian anime. Slice of Life about their life but they can go ham in action when it happen.
PvE comeback please
great animation, but is this event just gonna be us having to pay to get some actual rewards? Every "event" feels very dissatisfying as the "event' is just a BUY THIS PASS AND LOOK AT ALL YOU GET! kind of thing
Tudo que eu queria era que eles realmente fizessem uma anime ou uma mangá de guardiãs estelares, seria tãi perfeito
This is the most trailer of all time.
Excited for Star Guardian return, not excited for Seraph focus. But I'm copium that this might be the redemtion of her characterization that will push me like any remote part about that creature.
Don't do it Riot, don't play with my feelings. Please PvE mode.
I hope the PvE event comes back, I had a lot of fun! and it has to have a new opening, after Fates Fall my hype is on the moon \o/
ตื่นเต้นนนนนนน
Que isso Zé novo game
Всем наплевать
Star guardian making a manliest man cry
So, everlasting summer vibes, I see...
The animation 🥺😍
Studio Ghibli level animation😍
kai'sa
Ok where Void event

qiyana, easy
ITS HAPPENING ON MY BIRTHDAY?!?!?!?!
This animation is incredible, GJ riot!
my eyes are blessed with an amazing animation lol
Paka ganda putek na
my favorite skinline is finally returning! :'>
한국배경 시네마틱은 안나오냐구ㅜㅜ
ITS KINDA ANIME SERIES HMM?
Nice better nerf Asol
This looks like Makoto Shinkai quality backgrounds god dam
Imagine a story mode single player game  based on League's universe with a story based on the lores/comics... I wish this dream would come true
00:26 장로 드래곤 5성 ㄷㄷ
Me vacío sak fer
Holyshitttt, i want ivent
Summer Event is Star Guardian, hopefully there's also a nice media tie-in aside from the games.
Legends of runeterra tb
Predictions from the visual clues: Zeri's running shoes, Seraphine's microphone and-- the Orrery feels like it's meant to be significant but I'm not sure which champion it would be a reference to.
Finally !!!! So excited
Star Guardian/ KDA/ TD makes me happy
Thank you, Riot! I love your support of beautiful animation and storytelling. I'm not a gamer but I'm here for any shows you put out - Arcane is a masterpiece!
This felt like a Makoto Shinkai film!
0:43 Champions apa ini ?? KATARINA ?
muh void event
Legends of Runeterra too? OH BOY
Требуем полноценный сериал!
The animation and visuals are absolutely amazing! Riot just never stops giving W's!
Can we return to pve events instead?
The animation was so good that I had goose bumps
Keren, keren, keren, !!!
As a Kai'Sa main I am very hyped.
bring back Twisted Treeline
buff aphelios so i can one shot 200 years mäsisch
Ah yes, pretty cures
It's been too long!!!
this is just a compilation of aesthetic desktop wallpapers
this teaser made my day. amazing animation and colors are good too. long ago, I'm quit LoL, but maybe it's time to return...

Please be a PvE event, please be a PvE event pleaseeeeeee

Ahh yes Valoran City Btw what kind of anime is this?
AYAYA
The animation looks gorgeous! Looking forward to star guardian. Hope you bring back the game mode.
Can't wait to see my queens
Bruh SG anime would be better than arcane
a 1 minute clip having the same budget as a small European village.
a star guardian event instead of a void event. Really?
Makoto Shinkai!?!?!?
how is fiddle going to work with this....
Okay, this is hype! Can we start guessing whos that girl on the last scene
please bring back PVE
Yeahh 💘💘💘
So no void event this year
How many episodes this season?
This looks so aesthetic. Love it!!!
*me Excited for the new star guardian event  *Me as well  seeing my PC broken  *Also me : My dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Starguardian Seraphine Yay!
My wallet is ready, I'm getting the whole pack
난 또 발로란트로 봤네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋfiddle!!!
I wish they had the time and effort to develop some kindof anime asides from arcane
No void event sadge :(
riot you have the ability to make an anime series please do it
AMAZING!! my birthday is on july 10th so thx for the gift hehe
Makoto Shinkai draw this? Style like Makoto)
AVISA QUE SÃO ELAS
LOOKING GOOD FIDDLESTICKS  THAT PINK HAIR REALLY SUITS U
I love all the details in this animation! It even has a lock with Xayah and Rakan’s feathers!
This teaser is absolutely gorgeous the animation studio gets all the love
mas presupuesto que todas las temporadas de  Nanatsu
i need a star guardian anime the movie !!!!
can we get a star guardian udyr thanks
If they can make Arcane, then they could try bring Star Guardian to animated series.
Ok I need to hear the full song! This is aMAZING
Kai’sa looks great
I hate seraphine, but if this event has an pve mode than i would be really happy
I love it <3
Seraphine♥️♥️♥️♥️
We need and want a star guardian anime!!! Plz!!!
AS MAIORES
Star guardian anime plss! 🙏
Las filtraciones eran ciertas!!!! aaaaaaaaaaah
vbsñdfksadas she is seraphine ljdfvslakdgkjsajd
I think we can all agree, that unless you have no taste it should have been taliyah there.
I am so ready.
moar ayaya content pog
SG Gragas, it's his time now.
Ngl this is hype. I love the star guardian stuff and it really shows thag riot does as well. I hope riot does make a spin off series just for star guardians cause it has potential since they went ham into it
is that seraphim
THIS IS THE BEST ANIMATION YALL HAVE EVERRRRR DONE
please sona 💙🕊
I am literally crying buckets 😭😭
Porter Robinson on credits!? owo
Porter Robinson also work in this???
Wow This has such a nice vibe to it
the quality of the trailer is awesome, and i dont want to be negative at all because of all the good changes riot has brought so far, but i hope that this star gaurdian event brings us a pve game mode!
I'm crying
man its giving me final season  vibe wtf
I want star guardian aurelion sol or malphite
Corrr blimey
As a zoe main, super excited to see where they bring the story!! ^-^
Ive been waiting for this omg😭😭😭😭
Have to admit I'm a little proud that it's a Danish animation studio this time.  Star Guardians assemble!
Why can't they just recycle PvE game modes like every other developer? Doom Bots was one of my favorite game modes period and it would be ridiculously easy to bring it back each year
Did Riot just dropped 3 cinematics at the same time? I'm not complaining, though 😁
what who is this girl at the end
Anthony Fantano
If starguardian gamemode will be back that would be epic
GOD DANG IT RIOT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN ANIMATED SHOW WITH JAPANESE STYLE THEN JUST MAKE IT IM FEELING LIKE IM BEING TEASE BY THIS RIGHT NOW
That’s my thing
Use me as hype button   👇
what in the Kimi no Na Wa is this animation
Oh my God it's finally happening. It's finally finally happening!
Riot needs to stop calling majority of these things as 'Events'.
Hype
UwU xD
Is that Seraphine Voice at the background ? The piano seems for Sona and the stage with microphone seems for Seraphine ? 😮 Oh and the headphone ? 🤔
It's unsettling that everything is empty. It's not even abandoned; it's like everyone vanished in the morning...    like stardust.
Sona você merece!!❤️
Is that Ahri? Or Kai'sa?
The fact that every single scene could be a background is amazing 🥰💖🌠
I really need SG seraphine on pc version of league D;
THEY'RE BACK SHSHSHJSIWJANANABBAA
Am I the only one getting Doki Doki Literature Club vibes from this?
Violet Evergarden feeling
AAAAAHHHHH AHHAHAHAHA
Just for the event to be a OFA or URF
I just want a Arcane like series on the star guardian's skinline and their lore...
Yesyesyesyesyes
I WANT THE PVE MODE BACK PLEASEEEEEE
IM SCREAMING. MY FAVORITE SKINLINE OF ALL TIME 😭🤍🤍🤍
RIOT PLEASE MAKE AN ANIME WITH THIS!!! NOT LIKE ARCANE, BUT A REAL ANIME!!! WOULD BE A SUCESS
오아아아ㅏ시비
At this point everyone's just asking for multiple shows on each art style Riot's animators and artists been flexing over the years
OMG QUEENS
Easter eggs?  Music room - sona or seraphine Ballet Slippers and peach sticker - Kai'sa
More of this?!? SERIOUSLY?
Oh my gosh, I can't wait!
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!! 😭
meu deeeussss!!!!
make an anime already
Is that Porter Robinson in the description??? Hello???
How did this get such a great animation and the new champion teaser got done in what looks like 5 minutes?
At first i didn't notice this was lol video
I needed this in my life!!
wtf is this man, i think i just watched a ghibli film
My heart can't take it. I'm so excited, I can't wait!!!
makoto shinkai who?
Finally, Star Gaurdian Shaco is here
This teaser kind of reminded me of the movies "Your Name" and "Weathering With You". Very beautiful teaser, loved it. <3
Porter Robinson? Holy this is going to be good
Finally
SIM FOI ISSO QUE EU PEDI RIOT GAMES
Sona, Rell, Taliyah, all i was ever asking for is coming, star guardian 🥺🥺🥺❤️
Wah! Sugoi! Star Guardian Anime! 😻🤩💖
Still beautiful in 144p
Yeah  I'd watch this anime
AAAAAAA IT'S SO CUTEEEE💕💕💕🥺
cringe anime event
Wooow so cool new star guardian
im crying rn
Honestly can't wait to see how sick the dark side ppl are, like zoe is sick already but I hope syndra turns out to be evil too (saw a fan theory that those who followed the darkness directly or sum have those 2 coloured eyes like zoe and thats why syndra covers one of her eyes and transforms inside her ball to hide it) and gets that star guardian prestige as an evil transformation. Then akali, fiddle and Morgana are bound to be amazing.
Guys, are there any easter eggs relating to League champs you can find ?
Take note, anime. This is how you use 3D.
Riots needs to make an anime
0:38 Stargazer teaser?
Omg artstyle
Simp 🤣
i wish my application at riot would of been accepted. i think i would of been a great part of the team. because i know what league players want
What is this animation quality? holy aurelion sol this is soo good.
Star Guardians season 4, let's go! Hope my boy Rakan is still alive, now that Xayah is back with the girls and he's fully corrupted, the girls need to fight to bring him back too <3 (And PLEASE RIOT, don't make the redeemed' skin for both Xayah and Rakan be a WR exclusive, we are waiting for this version of them for years on PC!)
I am so in love with this. Definetely gonna buy everything i can
Mal posso esperar pra ver o Ekko T-T
Is Star Guardian the same universe as Battle Academia? Like, there is this fighting school that Lux attends but then she has a secret life as magical girl or smth?
Star guardian nilah💀?
Như anime ấy . Xịn vãi , hình như là Lux nhỉ ?
This is just magical ...... gj rito <3
Amazing
she is kaisa?.?
I don't even like star guardian that much... why am I so... happy?
Such a beautiful animation. I thought I was watching an anime trailer
Que saudade eu tava sentindo de vcs star guardians 🥺❤️
IM SCREAMING IM SCREAMING I AM GOING TO SCREAM ITS HERE!!!!
I hope it's not another "event" where you have a pass with no rewards without you paying and no exclusive game mode.
Oh great new anime
Ahhh! Nearly month to wait!
I wanna see fiddle sticks :( no more anime girls please ;(
AND IN LOR, LEAGUE, AND WILD RIFT TOO???? BET
teasing a month in advance? ohhh this gonna be goodddd
KATARYNA?
Star guardian pyke  nice!  15
im freaking me outtt
OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS GORGEOUS <3
I can hear seraphines voice in the background 😳😳
the aesthetic is just so beautiful. giving us kimi no nawa and weathering with you vibes
no
I WAS HERE
Riot's visuals and storytelling never cease to amaze me
oh my, im gonna use them as my wallpapers
AAAAAAAAAA
So nostalgic.
Shikimori-san is that you
aaaaaaa
Riot entertainment
The heart with Xayah and Rakan's feathers 😭😭😭
Can’t wait to see valorant city
so cool so cool so cool so cool so cool so cool so cool so cool so cool
a star guardian series plss😩
i see a lot of plant in this teaser so it means the new star guardian is ‘ ZYRA ‘ 🌺
This animation reminds me a little of Studio Ghibli.
hope this is a PVE event and not a short visual novel.
riot dropping videos left and right. from valorant to TFT and now League.
Please riot!!! Make an anime with this quality of animation!!!
We need anime star guardian
Man I can't wait to see fiddlesticks in a anime suit.
Riot Games making anime again...
All my money for SG yessss
Bring the gamemode back
omg ive waited so long for this
WOW THIS IS SUCH GORGEOUS ANIMATION!!! I hope lux gets something like a chroma or a new form as she is the first star!
finally, after waiting for 3 years(?)
Say Official anime trailer NOW.
YESSSS LETS GOOOOO
Finally Riot❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️
Nice
Wtf is this anime?
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
Make the freaking star guardians an anime, like, on the same universe with battle academia. It would go better even than arcane. I'm talking money moves here riot. Like, Lux and the girls for example are students with special powers and we see all the school drama and stuff with slay queens like cait and kata and during night they fight xayah and rakan and the other badies. MAKE IT HAPPEN
Animeeeeee aaaaaaa
PVE content or we riot.
*I WANT THE FALLING STARGUARDIAN LOGIN SCREEN BACK QWQ*
Teaser for Ahri VU? Really hoping the VU comes with the event
star guardian fiddlesticks pls
😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍😍🥰😍🥰
Odd way to announce star guardian seraphine
AYAYA senpaiiii, punish mee.
If this was an anime, my heart would be stolen! The artistic style is just... nostalgic.
Meu deus como esta lindooo 🥺🥺🥺❤
OMG I AM SO HAPPY AAAHH I've been waiting for this since started playing league omg!!
99% sure that's kai'sa
Me imagining star guardian akali because of japanese theme
This looks more like battle academia than anything, but I like it!
I want to see a whole anime in this style
Waw
I Wish Return to Star Guardian Game Mode

Will this be the summer event like Sentinels of Light last year?
Well, it's time to be a weeb, again!

Ahh ^^
These locks reminds me of Nisekoi. Anyway great trailer can't wait ^^
Straight out of "Your Name"
If this happens to be another pve event then props to Riot Games. Their PVE content is extremely underrated in my opinion and they stopped making those with the statement "not enough players find the modes engaging".  Hope we can prove them wrong this time
That's a whole animr
OMG ITS HAPPENING! Everyone calm tf down it’s happening!!!!
Looks like some makoto shinkai's movie
Riot chill, i dont have money :c
finaly
와

i love star guardian, but still i feel disappointed. Thanks to Bel'Veth it was somewhat clear that we wont be gettin the void this year but i just wish the teaser and everything wouldnt have hyped it up so much if it wasnt going to be Void.
