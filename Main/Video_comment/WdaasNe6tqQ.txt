I’m still gonna be living in my council estate bugger
Vik just gave, him lui vuton table tennis
Someone make a video baying that house to harry
That’s also mine
If Harry grinded he would be one of the richest
Harry should buy a piece of land in the Scottish highlands. That way he can go karting with the sheep.
That sounds like mine...
Harry every kids fantasy with money
he has the mind of a 14 year old boy its magical 😭
me watching this after them talking about jermery lynch football pitch and then simon get a 10x better one well done with the work
Without the car track we agree mate
"when you're older" yall are all almost 30 you are older haha, kids forever love it
Man answered his own question
What video is this
Harry super british
He’s just a big child. And I want his dream house
That sounds so fucking dope 😻😻😻
This is the most Harry answer I have ever heard
"When you are older" then describes a house that an 10 years old would dream of , gotta love harry and his childish side
Little do these guys know is that's their house will be whatever their wives will want.
I wanna be in the mountains near a small lake near a small town just away from all the noise
I hope he gets it
Yes please
That would go hard as fuck doing drift and all
If harry actually posting on both of his yt channel he might got the house already
He is older
The only things I'm changing is a basketball court, apart from that me and him are on the same page 👌😂
Menchildren
Sounds sick 😂
Bruh he sounds like a 10 yr old
Simons better
Bro needs to start uploading if he wants all dat
Harry could 100% afford that
think he meant round the outside of the pitch
I love the concerned "you would kill yourself" lol
Bro just built a multipurpose track
I can just imagine Harry Kart 8
and then harry got it he ride in his garden in another vid and was happy 🤓
So to round up....  He wants an amusement park....!!! 😏😏😏🤨🤨🤨
Nah for me its a bowling lane and a pool table
w house
It was supposed to be His dream house, not Mine🤣
Harry just described an amusement park
Cool but at some point there should probably be some growing up going on.
That is why it is dream house 🥲
he could do that now if he wanted
Don't forget to build a bridge
i love him
Friggin mario kart in the garden.
Harry does not have a dream house. He only has a dream garden
Asks the question to the other lads and answer it himself
Harry's just an old child.
Harry is so childish
That’s exactly what I want 😂😂
That’s exactly what I want 😂😂
His new parents house has a massive garden
Harry:- I want so much money for this house His fans:- yes upload a video first
Problem with that Harry is it becomes visible and obvious to any kid that uses google maps
Hello
tarmac tires
Ripping Joe Rogan’s content/questions
Sounds like a middle schooler dream house but props to him for keeping his inner child alive that's the key to happiness in the long run
I agree
My man!
Naahh that not his dream house thats an amusement park🤣😂
That’s literally Faze Rug’s house.
Sounds about right
where can i watch this?
I love how Brits put soccer goals in their garden, whereas Americans put tomato plants in theirs
Hello there!!! Many thanks to those who helped to fulfill the dream, and thanks to those who still help. Electronic wallet PAYEER, account P1072933102 🙏🤝Once again, thank you all very much!!!
Tobi : you'd kill yourself 🤣
Harry, you need to grow up
Harry building a theme park
Mans got the land mans just need to built the rest innit
Ohh need to play the 9 a side with yous been watching everyone since the beginning!! Like family I say things in your YouTube reacts and word by word yous pause it and say the same or I’m thinking the same specially happens with harry he has my wild thoughts that are funny af 🤣 I’m 24 honestly guys not on this channel but in since the beginning!! All the videos in the first house like around the stairs where it all started vik always stood next to the window seen every video of everyone since the beginning honestly it’s like I’m the missing piece like side YouTuber also good at football and 🏓 ping pong harry I’ll be the machine and a good laugh man pay my ticket we can shoot a video for YouTube maybe crossbar challenge or get Tobi in goals I stay in Scotland half Spanish
“You would kill yourself” -Tobi
Cocoa
oi
If you want that .... upload more
Holy shit this sounds so cool
Is this Harry's House
I wish he can livd forever
Harry will die alone
Does anyone know roughly how much Harry is worth ? I fully belive he should be the richest of the lot because he is the most down to earth relatable entertaining one 🤣
Tayyble Tennis
....
Harry wants exsplaining he want to play with a robot tbh thats just sad not ganna lie
I'd like to imagine that if we went back in time and asked little Harry this question, the answer would still be the same.
So that he can play 9 a side with his mum's head
Man think he’s a pro football player huh
Sound stick tbhh ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Explain your dream house when your older ? Sound like he’s explaining his dream house as a kid
Funny part is he wants this when he’s older. Still thinking like a child. Don’t ever stop Harry.
End up with his chickens
Sure mate. Says the guy who spends the least amount of money on anything.
Icl the go kart sounds sick
Meanwhile the rest of us are dreaming for A house 😂
Hope Haroldhinio gets his dream one day
Nah he will get a farm house 💀
This guy is still a kid 🤣
Always dreaming big, you love to hear it.
Thing is we all dream of having a crazy house like that but Harry can probably actually afford it 😂
Harry took go kart to a whole new level
With that kinda house I’d imagine that’s not going to be the only robot he’ll being playing with when he’s older
Harry gonna have to move to the U.S. if he wants that kind of land without paying a testicle and 8 figures.
I'd have his mum and his sister in it.
This has nowt to do with 'what it looks like 🙄' . This just a list of things in it and around it. Dumb AF
Mine as a kid was a mickey house giant statue looking one
That sounds fucking awesome
Sounds like my 5 year old brother's answer   Harry's still a kid he's just so innocent 😂
Dream house for kids. That's all I hear out of these guys.
Tobi outta nowhere: You will kill yourself
Only thing I would change with that is I'd have a basketball court instead of the 9 a side
The moment i saw harry Maguire i went to the comment section to see him get roasted
Harry should make the pitch a astro turf, so he could play maybe tennis, volleyball, basketball or whatever aswell
I'll just use Green Screen (VFX) and post photos on Instagram 📷🤳  Not Edit:- I don't have budget for my dream HOUSE..
If Harry wants that house he needs to start YouTube again
Harry is 12?
If you want to afford it Harold might need to upload some vids of ya own 😂
Surely he can afford it anyway
They taking this world to seriously 🤣🤣😂 literally everyone will die one day with that amount of money I would be travelling all the time
imagine sidemen football chalenge with jeremy linch
See Harry asked what you want when your older. But he's described what a 10 year old wants
Harry looks like the type of guy who has his entire savings taped to the back of his toilet seat.
A robot to play table tennis with.  How depressing. Just have some friends to play with.
Boring
Harrys next upload
Explain your dream house  Explains his dream backyard
Ohh u gotta be able to jump from the roof into the pool or even higher
If harry uploaded some more on his main channel, he’d probably have the dream house right now
This sounds more like a dream garden to me
Harry will never grow older and I’m happy
13 yr old in a man’s body 😂
This sounds more like a dream garden to me
Grow up
Well start uploading then again then Powder rangers ❄️🤣🤣
Koopa2s
He is playing with Robot 🤖 , What he is going to do with 9 a side football ⚽ pitch
*These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better 💚*
F1 track Lewis will be on it next season 🤣
These shorts are so entertaining, They never fail to disappoint me ❤️
I’d pay for huge land rather than a nice house in a expensive city. The amount of privacy you get in big lands is insane. You can do lots of things like fishing, doing whatever
This just shows how much money this man has 😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/BcevjulGUYc?feature=share
harry is perfect for podcasts
That is just too precious
Let’s see how many subs I can get from this comment
Bro wants romas stadium bruh
Mine is just a log cabin near a river
Then he woke
Vik can get all of that 💀
Man that would be sick if he didi it though.. 👌🏼
☃️
Funny thing is, his house now has a garden big enough for all of that
That is a real place in America
God bless everyone who sees this I hope you have a great rest of your day and a great day tomorrow God loves you ❤️🙏🏽🤍🕊🤍
This is prob my dream house too
And Harry forgot the kink room bc Harry is so kinky who agrees cmon 😆
The most fun house
It’s crazy that because of how congested London is to have a big backyard you have to be rich. or else you get a little patch of grass
It's kinda childish
Uploading to his main channel would help
Lmfao the pic of him and his mom in the yard
Cool
I agree completely with bog
Then fucking upload
Harry after this podcast: Alright it's Coke time 😏
Basically he's just explaining every man dream house, the only difference is that he may be able to actually afford it
Harry has  a  questionable dream house      🏠  I'm with him on the go-kart track tho
I wanna lazy river
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!   Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true) .
Harry’s dream house: a big garden
Harry talking about it while vik has just bought it   When I heard round the outside I just thought of Eminem 🤣🤣
Harry seems to have added a couple extra zeros to the actual sidemen balance
Pretty sure this is how Michael Jackson started.. 🤔
So this explains harry's big garden
Sidemen video at Harry's dream house
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.   Here’s a reminder of how much God loves you. God bless you🤍
that's literally my dream house
wow
Man explained everything but his house 😂
He will get bored of it except the football maybe?
😂🤣🔥
Mine too
Maybe if harry uploaded he might be able to afford it
i just want a swimming pool
Harry can make that dream come true if he posts on his main channel. Oh wait he doesn’t anymore. Now his dreams will not come true.
Harry's dream house is a 14 year olds dream.
Nah I want a three story house with the third story just being the game hall with arcade machines and having all sorts of consoles and PCs with all sorts of games the second floor to be a man cave with a massive theater and a gym  First floor to have a kitchen a living room and bedrooms the backyard I want to have it spread into the woods for 200 acres and hunt it in hunting season and have trails where I can send my razors and 4 wheelers through and my front yard to just have two trees a gate and a 7 car garage for all my dream cars
In the uk? Yeah good luck! 😂😂 In the US… Texas or Georgia, you can have all that for under 5 mill USD.
Monkey business
He's still 7yo in heart... bless him😂😂
This sounds fire
Epic
*Dream backyard
Harry and Simon looking gooooood
Harry is fucking 9 lmao
Oh
Didn’t describe his dream house he described his dream garden lmao
They call em gardens? Isn’t it a back yard
who made harry rich.
Damn
Bros rich enough
Would definitely love to live there
Bang
His house is the definition of ADHD 😭😭
*Claim your “here within a hour” ticket here 😎*
Why did you call your back yard, a “Garden?”  I didn’t see a vegetable garden or a flower garden.
Doctors
Europeans need to learn what a fucking garden is
Soccer ⚽🇺🇲🇺🇸
He could probably afford most of that
He’s truly a child
A 2 room bungalow with 1 bathroom and a fallout shelter under the washing machine
Harry is such a child that we can all accept how he is
He says when he's older but most likely will not use those things as much depending on how much older he is...
I just want a 9x9 m house man thats all
Man, I just want to live in my childhood home. It was so nice, lots of space, but not too big. I miss it so much. That's my biggest dream
you have to do a lap to go into the house because the driveway is the go kart track
Harry can I come live with you I’m a good handyman
Harry's dream house sounds sick
The thing is he actually will do this
Mark 8:36 "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" https://youtu.be/CLTAqJavYZU
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Let’s have an invite bogger
"Explain to me what your dream house looks like when you're older"  Proceeds to talk about HIS OWN dream house.
That's the house I would have imagined when I was 10
He forgot the secret crackhead hideout
The funny thing is he could totally afford it if he moved outside of London
That’s sick!!!
Gotta upload some vids first Harry
harrys like a five year old that can actually buy these insane things
I actually seen a house like that but it's a drift track
Garden British people Bru
So like... Why is everyone calling it table tennis? It's called ping pong
Myself I would like to have huge house with a studio to finally start streaming etc and a full basketball court... I would spend hours there probably
Go kart track? 1 week later after the track build, W2S upload a video "$1000 GO KART TOURNAMENT"
Imagine Tobi just predicted Harry's death...
This video is the perfect example of how men stay childish forever😂😂😂
This guy is chris distefanos doppleganger
Since they call a fucking yard a garden. What do they call an actual garden
Dream house when your older not 10 years old you fail
Well its not gonna happen if he doesnt upload.
:o
I like how his dream is so childish 😂
I would want that but you go through the house and in the house there is a crew chief and a bridge to get passed the road
Tobi: You would kill yourself  Harry: I would probably would 😌
Harry u needd to go to adam LZ's compound and have a few days or something there its so insane
Harry, you genuinely aren't good at table tennis 😂 You're literally an amateur, your friends are just horrendous so they hype you up because you can keep the ball on the table, can't even smash it without hitting it over the table
24 years old and has a dream house like this.. You just know he rich af lmao
I would want that to happen and have the boys playing there for a sidemen video
Jesus love you all
This is unbelievable 😂
Well looks like Harry needs to upload more 😂
a casket probably
Harrys such a kid
Harry tryna host olympic games in his crib
tobi didnt have to say it like that
It’s a real place - mini talladega Airbnb
If Harry kept consistent on his main channel he probably would have that by now😂😂
Harry: my dream house is going to be mad. Also harry: never post on youtube. 🤭
Did he just ask the question, AND give the answer???😂
His dream house is a dream house of a little kid  my fucking god.
Notice he said he’s getting it not he wants it at the end haha Harry’s determined on this one
This is trending in the Netherlands
Harry is such a kid 😂
This is dream baby boys same for u
My face what you ask me I am unon this facility  not like here
Dude, I want this
A man who knows what he wants
“You would kill yourselves”
This is a 7 year old dream
Mine would be the exact same as Harry's but maybe add a cheeky homemade roller coaster somewhere
Seems like a fun dream house actually, entertainment are the only luxurious thing Harry wanted for his dream house. That's good, I rate that.
Go kart track is super dope. I've never seen or even heard of that
Harry is in his 20s, living like he’s 12!🤣❤️🐐
POV Harry’s your favourite and your a British karting champ
Yet people still starving
Where's Mr beast at
only harry😂
Realistically: I smart house bit a quarter the size. One kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, and maybe an office. Everything is super hight tech and controllable. I’m a minimalist that enjoys tech so I quite literally don’t need a lot of anything to be happy.   No limits: everything above but it can fly where ever I want it to.
i mean i just want a cool apartment
We want the same thing, siiick
I want to buy a shopping centre, and turn it into my own go kart track.
So he's basically a child
The outside of his dream house reminds me a bit of what I would like for my outside dream house
Well, Harry could get all that, if he just made more videos
Y does he have the same dream house as mine!!!!!
He could literally have that 😂, it's not a dream to him
Mine is a mid century house with a bit of land to spend my days with my kids grandchildren fishing
Well then you gotta start uploading Harry!
He better start uploading then
"You would kill yourself" the subtle and direct way Tobi gave his thoughts 😂
So Harry want a SOCCER goal in his backyard hmm pretty cool I love SOCCER.
The fact that he could pay for that is concerning
Well my friend your first step is to upload on your main channel to make some cash
W2S comeback would be getting a footballer to play on his new pitch and F1 driver to go on his Karting track. Still waiting for the Mia Khalifa collab tho 😅
i would have a 2 basketball court (one full court indoor and one halfcourt outside), billiard table next to my table-tennis table near my back yard.
Harry: explain to me what your dream house would look like when you're older  Also harry: *explaining the most childish house ever*
Yall can already afford it, just get it😂😂
Well if he uploads more it will happen sooner whether than later
Then he better start uploading smh
Bxbx
Am i the only one who's dream house is a room where you have a single nice bed, rgb lights, manga collection on one side and a nice PC on the other ?
He’s gona have to upload then
Harry has the same dream house as i did when i was 10 years old 😂
His garden is bigger than his house
Harry shorts
Man's explained everything except the house
Ok but where u would enter the house from harry??😂😂😂
I want a pool like an indoor pool an indoor basketball court backyard where all my grilling equipment is a kitchen of course 6 rooms and a gaming room
Pewdiepie - that’s an S Tier house
harry would probably get his dream house if keeps uploading
Well he gotta start posting again
I wish I could by side+
"Explain to me what your dream house looks like when you're OLDER" proceeds to explain every child's dream house lol
Own a 20 acre of land grow all sort of fruit and vegetables and different type of plant
Is Harry 7 or what?
Most of the side-men: That’s cool Toby: Your going to kill yourself
Let’s be honest Harry could actually by that
Harrys dream house is my mates dads old house he lives on a castle now built on a hill he bought rich people shit
May harry's wish come true
What are you like 23 or 24, grow up you man child, this is probably the most infantilized thing I've heard in a while.
I want jeremy lynch in my garden
He better start uploading on his channel then 😂😂
Harry, you can just do that in your Guernsey house.
My dream house? One that I can live my life in and enjoy myself.
Tobi straight up telling Harry you will kill yourself 🤣
I think this just shows how much money Harry has and what he plans on doing with it when he gets older
I love when rich people talk about how rich they are 😂
he could build this for 3 mil in the us
He could have afford this if he uploaded at least weekly on his main but 🤣🤣🤣
Ya well he's not posting at all on any of his channels so he's not going to get that extra cash for his "house"
where are these shorts from
Harry would be sick
Very ambitious
I thought about having a track round my house but I drink too much and u already know me and the boys r drink driving round that bitch as at 3am
And a crack office
Im still waiting for that sidemen mario kart video
i thought he'd say his dream house is a house
Its like strandmans House
That's not a house that's heaven for big kids
with corrina kopf
Aliens attack in los Santos 👽 https://youtu.be/kxVHoKzUpes https://youtu.be/kxVHoKzUpes
Alternative title: Harry explains his dream garden he'd never use.
Vik 😍😍😍😍😍
For that........u have to upload 😑
That's the most Harry thing I've ever heard
I love how this isnt even a meme its just him actually describing his dream house so wholesome <3
he would probably get bored from go carting and golfing after one month🤣🤣🤣lol
What does he mean by when you're older
Harry: what does your dream house look like?  Vikk: *”i just bought it”*
Imagine saying Ur dream knowing it can come try easy🥲
If harry uploaded some more on his main channel, he’d probably have the dream house right now
pls have also paypal for sideplus in the netherlands almost nobody has a creditcard
harry: explain to me what your dream house looks like when you're older.  also harry: begins to explain just his dream garden 😂😂
Bruh this is exactly my fucking dream house
That freaking photo for harry’s garden lol
If he uploaded he might be able to afford it
This sounds more like a dream garden to me
maybe he should start to upload then lol
Well fuck, now I also want a go kart track in my back garden
These clips makes our days better
