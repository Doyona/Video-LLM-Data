Seb grabbing the fire extinguisher to put out the fire is the most Seb thing ever
Hi from 2024, in 13 hours we'll have the grand prix and Norris is on pole with max second and piastri third
What's the weird things on Tsunoda's car's front ?
Wow. Verstappen improved by .038 and hammy lost by .038..
Vettel getting almost as much professions as Johnny Sins
Hello hidden Cowards at you tube, hidding & harrasing like proper Cowards 😀 👍
Until perez up to the speed n in the mix, max need to it all alone. In some races, theres still limitation for him like in barcelona  n mercedes got the upper hand tmr.
Why does the commentator feel the need to SHOUT AT ME please stop, it's absolutely dreadful and ruins the highlights
Often in the hybrid era when Hamilton has a problem in practice or qualifying, he wins the race.
Dutch always make tricky circuits. Not only F1, their motogp circuit TT assen is also a tricky one.
Spinoda is now a thing ladies and gentlemen tokyo drift in F1.
Verstappen 😀 👍 💪 😀 👍 💪
Ocon really is a dangerous bast..d.
When was this
did he knee
Seb is like Thanos when he put on the Infinity Gauntlet, "Fine, I'll do it myself." Gotta love the guy.
We cant drink beer in a pub .... zandvoort hold my beer
New Job for vettel
,
I am request f1 youtube admin to someday make a compilation video of seb trying to be firemen, marshall, medic etc. Respect this guy
if only i could watch it Live.....
Kimi was a third driver in FP1
Media really hype up the practice sessions like they are a race. There’s no points and it’s just practice. They don’t hype football players kicking the ball to each other prematch or tennis players warming up 😂
The Evolution of Formular 1: Cars get faster but not possibly to race in rain anymore, and if an engine blows up it now takes 37 minutes to remove a car parked on the track.
Vettel is Johnny Sins of F1
Howw can you be upset with PER P16?! It's a practise session!
Go Max!
Like for kimi to get another podium
Seb has another job to add to his resume
Ontzettend fijn om al die mensen zo te zien genieten.  Very great to see al those people enjoying.
What reason does the HAAS team have in F1
How do you make a highlight video of 3 (2) laps?
Resumen en Español por favor, piensen en todo el publico
Let the haters hate Lewis, their tears will be all the sweeter to taste on the top step come Sunday. lesssgoooo
コース全体が波打っていてマシンが細かく跳ねてる様に見えるのは俺だけだろうか… このコース危険な香りがする。
The honorable tomato muhly ban because eel nutritionally decay below a tested tower. overt, pleasant den
A guy who has more than ten years experience like sergio should not struggle 5his much. 8tents slower than max
Sergio perez out and alex in with more grip and rear stability this year alex will be much better
If Sebastian Vettel work as a marshall i am sure he will be the best (fastest/most reliable ever)  Guys do u agree if so like it if u don't agree comment it
Firefighter seb
How about F1 indonesia mandalika circuit 2022...so wonderfull circuit..
Happy to see that GioGio is improving.
☑️☑️
Spa "hero" Russel
Hopefully it will not be a boring race...
Vettel is now officially my favorite driver after this! Just in time to replace Kimi.
Perhaps they should have asked the Formula E Safety team for help, as they have to do this often. They do it pretty quickly too!
Vettel🥶🥶🥶🥶alpha
I wonder if Hamilton passed 7 cars on his 1:11.5
C'mon Lewis
Respect for the way you said hugenholts bocht !
Can Max hit Lewis and get 10 seconds penalty but win the race in Zanvoort? Lets see
The fire extinguisher even says Ajax haha. So Dutch and didn’t know this was even a brand
Can someone tell me what is that in Tsunoda's car? 0:12
Nice Ferrari
marshal seb makes another epic return
I just want to go to Holland
Zandvoort is a great sweeping track.....but not for F1, it's too short. It's more suited to slower cars like GT4s and touring cars.
Doesn't green light mean the car is safe to touch?
Vettel like Rossi always care about this car/bike
whats that "fence" on Tsinudas car?
Lewis vs Max, and.....….….........      ..........The Rest !
What is that grill like thing on the front of Tsunoda’s car??
There is no reason they couldn't have just tacked that 37 minutes onto the end of the session to give everyone a go.
Seb learned his fire fighting skills from Kimi.
Seb is the best actor in F1, better than Mansell for sure.
whya’s that thing on tsunoda’s car, its steel thingy
Next time....😄 Moto GP move from circuit Assen to Circuit Zandvoort 😏 That circuit is much COOL
What an awesome track!
Why does yuki have steel infront of his car😂
What’s That on Tsunoda’s car? 🤯
The track is that close to the beach??? That's awesome!
Are we going to see mazepin fastest lap? Are you going to give points based on qualy results?
Such a cool track 👌🏻 looking forward to the battles on Sunday!
Max never had a clear lap. His long runs though were really fine
What were those things on tsunodas car?
1:03 thats me
What is happening with Perez? How long is it been he could impress us?
Hi, second video i’ve watched on this channel. First one was the highlights from spa. I love the fact that this video has some more racing cars in it. Where is the red c-class that won on spa?
For Some reason I can't take my mind of an incident happening tomorrow and having the race stopped due to poor respond from those peps at the circuit.hopefully I  wrong 🙏
nice to see the Ferrari cars running well
Corrida  boa
THis track is not made for modern F1 i think it will be chaos during the race and even in quali.
1:41 Overtaking possibility confirmed at turn 1 by a Haas.😅
Zandvoort’s like Fiorano?
Horrible track. Too narrow, poor infrastructure.
Let’s just hope Mercedes won’t somehow miraculously funk up Max‘s race again….   as they did in the last two real races. For me Mercedes is clearly on probation, if they do something like this again I seriously hope they take away all their points so far.
smoke come out from his asston martin
A three way battle between Gasly, Schumacher, and Bottas. Why do I feel I'm going to be hearing that a lot next season?
Roses are red, Violets are blue, Sebastian Vettel, We all love you
I got to see only one of these highlights with screens very far away.  On tv it really is better. (No internet with that many people.)
The Dutch guys from Orange ☺️☺️love representation 🧡🧡
Seb, if you want, has another profession outside of f1
I can't believe this is happening, sending positive energy to the guys
Hamilton in orange everything for me
Fireman seb
Hamilton…BOOOOO BOOOOO 👎🏻. GO MAX 👍🏻🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
Props for Will Buxton correctly pronouncing turn 3 "Hugenholzbocht"
Saw a rain cloud....might have to cancel😥
what are those metal things on tsunoda's car just behind the wheels?
0:12 what's on the Alpha Tauri?
Come on Ferrari💪🔥
Vettel and sins are becoming more like eachother
Hear me out… switch Perez with Ricciardo their styles match the other one’s car
Me gras!!
Get in there Lewis !! 👍🇬🇧🏆
The new sensors in the Merc PU seems to have a very narrow temperature window 🥸
Can’t wait for 2022
That track just looks so small for F1 cars
Free Practice One and Ocon fighting for the Line or something else? Why?  He deserve a Penalty? What do u Think about it?
GO MAX!
What is that thing on Yuki’s car
Pretty sad how that overrated driver from that country is not even on Poll on his home track 😂 you're right it's because Lewis  car is so much better 😂
SHAMILTON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What? I thought green light means the car is safe
Everyone wondering what the metal grid behind Tsunodas wheels is...  Its called a "sticky-outy bit" and it's purpose is to sit on the front of the car behind the wheels, and ensure that the car doesn't not have sticky-outy bits there.  If he didn't have that grid, he'd have less sticky-outy bits at the front of the car so that would obviously affect performance.
Everyone says this track is narrow but it seems decent
What does " the car was still electrically live" mean...??? When Seb's car broke down...
Yuki had some weird things on his car
I love this circuit
Wy Come out nederland
whats that thing on yuki's car?
What’s the grill on tsunodas car at 0:15?
Love how it's not "George Russell" anymore, it's "the hero of Spa"
Kovalinen-Vettel
Subtitle in spanish to Latinoamerica Please
The descriptive cup greely wish because caption empirically instruct until a outstanding twilight. little, tangy twilight
Cowardly minus Verstappen fans with your cheers when Lewis dropped out. No man overboard LOL!!! No Consequences and or Punishment for Lewis. On the contrary, by dropping out Lewis just ruined minus fastest lap hahaha LOL!!! Moreover, Mercedes still has enough engines left to switch and so who knows tomorrow Lewis will set the fastest time with a new engine and take Pole!!! Bottas was also very fast and will take the 2nd place tomorrow!!! My feeling is that there will be another 1-2 for Mercedes and that there will be another deception for the cowardly arrogant proud RBR!!! And also a huge deception for the cowardly arrogant minus Verstappen fans who see their idol lose on Zandvoort! LOL :P ;)  Booohooo to minus and jos verstappen, horner, jan lammers, louis dekker, prince bernhard and the fans thereof!!!  Gooo Gooo Lewis!!! It's Hammer Time!!! GoooGooo Bottas!!! GoooGoo MERCEDES-AMG-Petronas!!! :):):):):):):)
It's just practice, on the rollercoaster....
Hamilton is what what… NO !!! Hamilton is the best ever. The numbers don’t lie.
Seb's professions are passing johnny sins's.
" how much orange do you want? " Deutschland: YES
This is gonna be the best weekend ever for me :)
"Problematic"
Sebastian Vettel deserves to drive the Aston Martin safety car...
Still more laps than spa
We have a potential win for bith ferraris! FORZA FERRARI, FACCIAMOGLI VEDERE CHI COMANDA
Ocon forgot that this wasn't f1 multiplayer
Vettel having more professions than Johnny Sins
Yuki Spinoda
Ah didn't know all bar one had raced on this track before in different formulas. Though the track has been revised recently hasn't it?
Alpeen
"Max could only muster P2, nine-hundredths of a second behind his Championship Nemesis Lewis Hamilton ", Lord this British chap can really spice things up with his "sophisticated" vocabulary. and I love it lol. bring the Action!
Come on Max, we haven't seen you race properly for 2 months now, keep it orange this weekend
I love the banking and gravel!
Seeing the banked corners makes me wish they would race at Daytona Road course.
What’s the metal grid behind tsunodas front wheels?
Carlos Sainz Is P3 Charles Leclerc Is P4 in F1 Dutch Grand Prix Practice 1 🇱🇺
Verbieden die onzin
Crazy thought...when a practice session is stopped by accident,  car problems,  etc. Like here for 37 minutes,   uh add 37 minutes to the practice session
I love this track,Old school design.I think they should bring back Watkins Glen !
Should have given ocon a penalty
La formula 1 de cagada
What was that “grill” looking thing on Tsunoda’s car?
Worst track ever
As Europe does what it can to stop Hamilton getting  his 8th world championship....This one was bottom  of the barrel though...
Never thought the racing line they drove here in T3 was the outter line, not the inner.
Whats are these parts at tsunodas car at the front?
I just want a great race between the drivers ..... Then Lewis skids off and breaks a leg 🤪🤪😆😆😆
*Pérez showing why he should've been replaced*
Interesting.  From the roll-hoop camera angle -  we’re able to see an awful lot from the steering wheel displays of Mercedes, Alfa, Ferrari, Aston, even Alpine  But the Red Bull display is almost completely black from the same angle.   Not saying that the average fan/viewer will know what any of the display details/numbers/info means, but very intriguing that RB have made that a thing… 🤔
Tsunoda or Mazepin? Hahaha who got spins
I guess Vettel decided to be a firefighter.
0:52 Nice livery
Goatifi
What were those things on Yuki's car?
F1 <3
I m new to f1, can someone tell me what that grill like thingy attached to Yuki Tsunoda's car?
In "his" pe-F1 career? Pretty sure Yuki's a he/him?
See a tyre popping on one of those banks during the race with a more degraded tyre
Seb is the man he always shine with new talent now he was a firefighter
Nostalgia
what's wrong with Checo?
Whose bright idea was it to take F1 cars to a NASCAR type track where no overtaking is going to happen, and sand is going to blow on their tracks and engine? Might be fun for the drivers, but it will be a bore to watch, unless we see plenty of SCs.
I’m a bit confused on what was on yuki’s car
How long has it been since they raced here?
Vettel: Firefighter.  Grosjean: Hold my Beer!
Goatifi
Mercedes very fast!👌🏎👍👍💪💪
I see Ferrari on Podium XD
Is tsunoda the nu spinner cause i have heard him spin a lot this season as well
(PT-BR) Em 0:52, acabamos de ver nessa cena que Sebastian Vettel também foi formado em Segurança de Trabalho e Bombeiro
Essa corrida promete
lol the thumbnail...just saw a bunch of ppl recording the guy didn't look like anyone was actually watching him they all just had their phones in front of their face this world is whack now
mickey mouse track...
What are these bars on tsunodas car?
F1 really is a circus! 37 minutes delay because a car broke down? You have to be kidding me:-) This race has potential for a trillion laps behind the Safety Car and/ or Red Flags. Everytime someone gets off track Masi will play it safe. Fans will love this one as they paid premium Euros for a circus. One can only hope carma will get Lewis a DNF in order to get some excitement back from a torpedoed champioship. However, I have a hunch that Mercedes still has a few torpedos left in their armament.
Goo Kimiii
I'm really glad to see the cars here. Drove the track on the F1 Game and it's really fun!
The cerbs here should be manufactured like those musical roads where if you drive over them it plays a song And the song they pick should be MAX MAX MAX SUPER MAX MAX
Sebastian Vettel: *GAINS NEW TITLE* Firefighter Seb! To add to his other titles as Father, Mechanic, Race Engineer, Medical car, safety car, race director and strategist.
Did they ever give refunds for the last race?
I Love the banked turns 👍 more circuits should have them..after all, our highways have slightly banked turns for us normal drivers.
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
1:34 Unsighted Esteban Ocon?! Nah… he was checking that left mirror he knew hehe.
Fire Marshal/Instructor Seb is on it!  🔥💨🧯
Championship Nemesis: hola
Alonso's helmet cam would be great for this track. I'm sorry, it would be great for every track.
Not gonna lie: I really want Ham to win this.  The Ver fans have driven me nuts since Silverstone.
EL. REY LEÓN NO VA A VENIR A FIESTA SE SUSPENDE LA FIESTA HASTA MAÑANA A LA MISMA HORA
Explain to me why the colour Orange
I foresee a disastrous race weekend… mark my words
37 minutes to clear a car that was 3 metres from a marshals gate..
What a nice layout for a track 🤩
Nice
A drizzle of rain and this circuit is MUAH 😈
Spinoda mazespin😂😂
Max coming off of some serious momentum after a big win last week lol
Vote for kimi sunday for driver of the day
Love these  Verstappen fans hats! Complete with windmills, clogs, tulips, and F1 car!! Great stuff! 🤣
Truth be told... FPs doesn't mean anything to the top time sheets XD
Go Yuki! Go !
Seb is omniscient. He transcends mortal man's accomplishments.
Why does Vettel have to put out his own car? Where is the safety staff in this place?
If Zandvoort came back, why wouldn't Brands Hatch, Mont Tremblant or Mosport come back!
Durante o final de semana inteiro os pilotos vão ter muitas dificuldades
As curvas são  de alta intensidade
Spa "hero" George Russell what a joke !!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
1:38 Lando: ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE TO LEAVE A SPACE
Roller coaster like feel at zandvoort 🤣
Prachtig
0:54 He just dropped the fire extinguisher
Hero, Inspector, Firefighter Seb!
What was on yukis car??
How is Max , Lewis's rivals? One has 7 titles and  the other one zip! This Rivalry is created by the media and some thick fans...
If the establishment and co are trying to push Lewis out in unjust manner they will be put to open shame Let the drivers do their jobs without negative psychological dramas to deter and discourage
P3 p4   pls dont give me hope
Why did the top ten get shown for 2.5 seconds and 11-20 for a full 10 seconds? Just a minor issue but a weird one
Seb actually has many talents other than driving. Joker, fire fighter, detective. I believe there are more shown in the future.
Alpine is very strong in FP
What was the metal structure at the front of Tsunoda's car?
1:44 only in 2021 will you ever hear that
I am Praying for Vettel ( actually I am not Vettel Fans before I know Who is Vettel )  I Pray Vettel Wins The Duth Grand Prix 2021 🏆🏆🏆🏆
It's funny being an avid Indycar viewer and seeing "banked corners" be a big talking point of a race.
Hamilton is gonna beat verstappen's circuit lol  payback for the british grand prix fiasco
What is the thing attached to the front of Tsunoda's car?
What is the white line on the vettels racing line
Perez disappoints! Wish he finds some form in quali
Seb always be like Seb.
Now Sebastian has done lots of jobs...
The track looks extremely challenging.
This track will be chaotic come race day, I see plenty of 'miscalculations' leading to incidents on that banked turn especially.
dude Bottas getting punked by Gasly and then Schumacher lol
Can we have a seb compilation of his other professions
Why did they not stop the clock for the 37minutes it took to recover Seb's car. F1 needs to sort some of it's rules out after last weeks debacle.
I’m moving up and down side to side like a rollercoaster!
Mistakes look veryyyy expensive on this track
I have a British heritage but the ever-consistent naivety and obvious favouritism by Crofty. Ant. Brundle, etc, etc & etc.... etc... etc.. (Sky) including any media "body" who favours Hamilton is blatant and pathetic. The double standards and PC antics of Hamilton and their back-up of said protagonist is woeful and shameful at best.   Q. How many times is Lewis or Lewis Hamilton mentioned throughout any given GP weekend vs Max or Max Verstappen, likewise the difference in general connotations towards HAM vs MAX.  If you can't notice this from the shameless Sky-puppets then start taking note...   Lewis fans, I'm sorry. It's clear and true.
Checo Perez is a disgrace
Vettel after retirement :: fire fighter 🔥🔥
Man with windmill,the Ar the best
Gotta say, the banked parts of the circuit are amazing
Tf is the thing tsunoda have in the front?
Marshal seb again
Crashtappen fans were so gassed when Lewis engine failed can't wait to see their faces after he wins his 8th wdc 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I swear I hear a discord ping at 2:05
I’m pretty sure Jenson Button is changing his name to Vax Merstappen!!😜
FIA : banking are banned from formula 1  Zandvoort : here is the deal, you agree with it and i will pay it for you deal?   FIA : *Okie*
Vettel unlocked the Firefighter character.
Let's hope alpine does well in race
Cannot wait for Lewis to win the race! And Max’s fans crying with Boos!
wow the Dutch Track looks amaazing !!!!!!!
0:50 seb was showing what he got during his time with ferrari 👍🏼
Bwoah
should be a fun race, like racing down supermarket isles.
If you see a dude named Tropical Tree just ignore him he talks bad about Seb and posts laughing emojis randomly like “slow-seb hegggfb 🤣🤣🤣”
Johnny Sebs in action
Lewis will win
Let's see how Reebulls cry babies and Max stands up against the racists chants. When you as a athlete stands up and say it's okay to boo competitors you are igniting the fire cause in no sports is it  okay for a home team or person to stand up and say it's okay to boo the visiting team.  What a disgrace.
This track feel so old school, I liked a lot.
Why the other alphatauri has a screen in front
Seb is always seb!
What was that thing on tsunodas car
Tsunoda proving he is the worst on the grid more and more.
My main man Checo better start providing soon
0:12 anyone know what that metal net thing is on the front of Tshnoda's car?
What is Perez doing
0:12 what is that on his car? Protection, sensors or what?
I can hear a lot of curse words at Saturday 🤣
I‘m waiting for a compilation on Vettels sidejobs at f1
Max must lose this
I didn't realize it's really Friday til I saw FP1 highlights.
How many cars will get to the finish on Sunday. This is a unforgiving track. One mistake and your out.
I hope Verstappen does not finish the race so I can laugh at him.  From Mercedes-Benz fans
Sick
I hope there will be some overtaking action come raceday.
How dumb to not stop the clock when  there is a red flag. All of those people in the stands paying to watch a practice get "charged" to watch a car sit for 30 minutes. What a joke.
I already know Sunday is going to be an exciting day.
Why is the clock still ticking down under red flags ?
When will you upload the Belgian GP highlights???
Nascar called and said can it have its track back please.
Bruh before I saw “fp1” I almost had a heart attack thinking I somehow missed the Grand Prix 💀💀
Ferrari will be one two in fp2
Whats the things on tsunodas car
Small trash  circuit from the looks of it which is disappointing  I already hate Monaco
Seb is gonna be the race director in the future. Just watch.
Yeah, it's always the fault of the conditions, never the sport. 37 minutes to remove a car?!?! This season's farce continues. They can't help themselves. It's starting to reach laughable levels now. The cracks are starting to show now at just how messed up and technical this sport has been allowed to become. The only ones who ever pay are the fans, whilst everyone else gets PAID for a very shoddy product these days. Value for money? Not even close. A brand new track that expects no places to overtake. Or is this an ode to the future of Max Verstappen, which the F.I.A clearly heralded in last Sunday's shocking display of 'doing as it was told' by Christian Horner and Red Bull. Can't blame them, elistists gonna elite!! Yes, F1 had this salt coming to it! Sort out your act ffs!!
@1:20  loved this
Somehow it just feels like Monaco
And the next seb meme 😂
Dayum, now Firefighter Seb, What's next? Seb Mechanic
That is a sloppy job from seb
Whatever happened to Perez…. Disappointing and sad.
Vettel doing like Heikki ! ❤
Giogio at 8th is very impressive for FP1. Let's see how it goes from here...
Spa hero Russell 🙌
does anyone see an issue with not being able to touch a car?
PEREZ ???
What was the metal thing on one of the cars?
Ash-ton martin
It's nice to see both Ferraris doing well, hopefully they can carry their pace through qualifying and the race itself.
I want Yuki to do well, but when your drinking game is taking a shot whenever he spins or blows his stack on team radio...
So now we can add ‘Fire fighter Seb’ to the list as well
Coloca legenda em português  🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Seb's resume keeps getting longer and longer. Eventually it'll be dangling between his legs.
He drives He cleans He puts off fire  The name is Sebastian Vettel
Max home event begin with an close leader battle, Seb lucky to get no penalty after unsafe parking, Dutch comeback with news and an really rollercoaster track the shortest track of the season
QIMY RAYQONENN
Vettel has more professions than Johnny Sins. Maybe even a bigger PP
Put V10 engines back where they belong!!
Seb be like: time to add another profession to my CV!
Nederland laat je horen
OCON IS A DISGUSTING DRIVER AND PERSON! WHAT IS HE DOING TO NORRIS ON PURPOSE. WE DONT WANT TO SEE SUCH A DISGRACE DRIVERS IN F1!
Garbage track. Not that it's boring but probably won't see any racing. Just another Monaco
what are the things on yukis car
It’s no exaggeration how narrow the track looks with these cars, huh?
Seb is the definition of the duality of a man lol what a great guy
Something went wrong by exporting this highlights video
That number 2 Redbull seat is really cursed isn't it.
Give Vettel a British passport.
Oh how I wish we could see the W11 go around this track. There may never be a car so stuck and so dominant again.
0:12 can anyone explain me whats that mesh  on yuki car
Hey Pirelli, you're not nervous about this weekend, are you?
Y did yuki have a metal cage on his front wheels?
Seb now has another job of his already many.
Why did Vettel have hard tires on? And Norris mediums? Wouldn’t they all want soft for this session
Where's Casper?
When is the new engine for the Ferraris coming?
Idk is it just me but i feel like lando has losing some confident after the big crash in raidilion
Seb almost has as many professions as Jonny Sins
Cars can barley fit.
Grosjean: I am fire Vettel: Gets the fire extinguisher
Where is my  money refund after Spa farse last week?
Giovinazzi: 8th Alfa: "LOL, let's kick this guy"
well, ferrari seems consistent. performing at fp 1 and sliding down the timing sheet until quali.
Those hats!!!!
Whats up with Perez?
Vettel is quickly becoming a true legend.
Pérez is a shame
Great, another narrow track. What we most need with the current giant f1 cars
This needs rain otherwise it's going to be boring AF.
Vettel will become a Race marshals after he resigns from F1
Johnny Sins got nothing on Sebastian Vettel
Que desastre Checo
mazespin
Everyone praising mazepin in comparison to Tsunoda just for him to beach it in the very NEXT session 😂😂
H A M I L T O N 🙌
So.... I guess if the rest of the weekend is rained off... Hamilton wins? 🤷‍♂️
A co to za siatki które miał z przodu swojego bolidu Tsunoda?
1:04 Vettel is finding Carbon dioxide fire extinguisher instead of powder fire extinguisher to protect the engine😂
What’s that on tusnondas car?
When it showed tsunodas spin at the start what was the cage looking thing on the sides of his car???
Get in there Lewis
Someone checked the weather forecast?🤣
Man is perez too slow in that car
vettel added one more professions in his f1 career...the FIREMAN SEB
whats happening to dani ricciardo ?
Latifi ahead of Russel...   Latifi Mercedes confirmed 2022
Lando norris in zandvoort: i moving up and down side side like the roller coaster
Only a 1min 11secs, I thought zandvoort was longer than that
I can see another meme about Vettel
So many McLaren fans in Zandvoort. That will give Lando and Danny an extra push. :D
I wait for Perez to be somewhere in the thick of things
Seb becomes literally everything
first 2021 merc engine blow
2:07  Wow I've never seen the graphics look so big!  And top 10 taking the whole height!
Tsunoda had he raced at all on any of these circuits. There has been quite a few now.
Awesome to see Dutch fans really getting behind Max, their presence will be very telling I think. I hope they get their man on the podium.
Sebastian is the Johnny Sins of F1
การต่อสู้ของแบรนด์เครื่องดื่ม ระหว่าง red bull กับ monster.  ทำไมมีแค่2ยี่ห้อนี้   ทำไม  carabaodang กับ M-strom150. ไม่มาบ้าง   ผมเม้นเอาฮา อย่ามาม่า
Ferrari the kings of FP1
Hopefully max wins his home grand prix
He’s always on the scene, Fireman Seb with his AM dark green, Fireman Seb is the one to adore, Seb is the hero next door!
Seb: “I have an issue. This car is not very ring a ding a ding today”
Seb is doing too much
Can you overtake on this track?
*the best track ever*
How is this video out i swear the practice begun at 10:30
Yeah I see some crashes incoming
Now there even more seb memes. firefighter seb, made my day. F1, we love you so much ❤️
Last week he became medic and steward. This week he became firefighter. Next season he'll make his own team, build his own car, drive it and steward the race himself. Vamos Seb!
Sebastian is taking lil Wayne fireman song  to heart 😂
P2 is happening a Lewis car has a power failure
1:19 is that the old guy from Super Max?
Dutch fans will not be happy about this one
What was the thing on yukis car in the first scene of fp1
what was on yukis car
A NEW CHARACTER HAS BEEN UNLOCK: Firefighter seb
0:41 Podium's not ready
So we have FP1 Highlights buy no last race highlights, uh? 🧐
Seb: don't worry guys.. I will fix my car engine later.. 🤭🤭
I moving up and down side to side like a roller coaster..
“With Spa hero George Russell fifteenth . . .”  Yeah, he had qualified at the right time.  Too bad the FIA soiled it with an ersatz second place finish . . .
It's going to be a tough race for the juniors
If this is Merc back on form, then im sorry guys, its game over for this season!!!!
King Latifi 12th
Is there anything Seb can't do???
Interesting how some of the guys are having issues with coming into the banked turns..
That ocon guy should get a penalty
Puh puh puh purchase a pop filter, W Buxton.
I see Seb is just being Seb
nederland laat je horen
I want Hamilton to take his 100th Win in Nederlands..
Does anyone from Zandvoort know if it's possible to see the track from the hills? (without ticket)
On a Japanese television, the commentators keep saying that here looks similar to Suzuka. It actually makes sense haha. Nostalgia
F1 is a joke sometimes, one team causes a red flag and all of the sudden the whole hour is wasted and nobody can race anymore. People who paid to be there on FP1 basically got only ~20 mins of cars running.
Now Verstappen has to push of Hamilton off the track in the first rond in his home GP, just like Hamilton did at his home GP. Then they are even. And Verstappen should win of course.
The worst and boring track in F1 calendar with France. The best was that it was cancelled last season. Its a Go Kart track and not a F1 track.
❤️
Is this track new. Or did they all new
Seb will be podium
Return SPA MONEY!!!
Hopefully Ferrari can keep this up
Whoooo! Ferrari Forever!
Pleaaaase add subtitles
Nobody sees that Perez is struggling same as Albon
Remember guys, we're voting Kimi DOTD for this race...
Go go go Lewis
Anyone else shocked about Hamilton getting P1? He's been pretty trash at qualifying and this is a tricky track.
Use me as a Vote Kimi for driver of the day button
marshals are clowns second time
So Hamilton is already the fastest in FP1? Hambotver, directly delivered to your door.
What was that thing that Tsunoda had in front of his tyres?
As a dutchman i still cannot believe there is F1 in my country after all those years. It feels unreal.
tsunoda overrated
The incident between Esteban ans Norris  was a practice incident ,norris  overtook and  Esteban didn't see him Both are at fault .
Looking forward to seeing seb as FIA president!
0:12 What is that on his car???
What happened to Perez ,why his time is so low?
Aston broke down as a true British car should
Fireman Seb!
I should sell oranges 🤔
Superman
Let’s see another epic battle between Max and Lewis! Hopefully this one lasts longer than a lap!
Dari Sulawesi nih
Why’d Yuki have a fence behind his front wheels
Ham on top 👑👑
Looking through some of the comments, I couldn't help but notice one user who doesn't seem to like Vettel.
If fans got you the championship, Vettel would already be the invict champion
Waffle
I am will not gonna lie This track looks só dangerous
Vettel doesn't get tired of surprising the fans
ALPHA TAURI MUST SEND TSUNODA AWAY . IT TAKES DANII KWYAT...
"Un-sited ocon" bruh he looks directly in his left mirror before moving over on Lando
It Will be a great racer
Ferrari what are you doing up here?!
First time I played Zandvoort on the F1 game I was like WHAT IS THIS, WHAT IS THAT, WHAT IS THIS. It was a nightmare. I can't wait for the race.
The Aston is absolute 🔥  (obligatory joke)
Never clicked so fast for a FP1
Sou brasileiro quem lembra do Heikki Kovalainen
Gasly always sees just the Aston Martin back wing...😂 btw love him.
Seb: "Wasn't part of the contract again but alright I'll do that also." 🙄
The only place in Holland that isn’t flat.
Bottas working closer and closer to that Alfa Romeo seat for next season
is there anything seb can't do?
The full stants was full max fans
Tsunoda -> Spinoda Mazespin -> Mazebin
Clock needs to stop under red flag, this makes no sense.
Traffic. Therefore no realistic times where made. This will happen in Zanvdoort. Without the traffic Max would take 1st
Firefighter Seb is in da building
Super MAX
not many highlights on the Spa GP, eh?
Makes sense that Ferrari are doing well, since this is very Monaco-ish. Looking forward to tomorrow for sure!
Usually the alpines do well in free practice because norris, Ricciardo and Pérez are nowhere to be seen. Then in qualy Alonso fails and ends up behind ocon and they both barely reach p10. And then somehow Alonso crushes it during the race and ends up in front of Ocon in p7 or something
Wow they posted the whole practice😂
If Lewis wins then the whole grandstands will just rage
Well for Tsunoda... yes, it is his first time here but you know how he do. He and Mazepin can do a beyblade duel.
Inspector, Firefighter and still couple of years left
Seb: Can pilot one of the most sophisticated pieces of machinery on the planet.  Also Seb: Can't figure out the simple procedure of a fire extinguisher.
Why is perez always so slow?
New achievement unlocked firefighter
The call for RIC was bang out wrong 🤔
Ocon wasnt unsighted,look at onboard he looked his left mirror he saw Norris coming yet he still turned into him.
lets go lewis!!
Not one highlight of the cars attacking the banked corners. Superb highlights smh.
This race is going to be carnage
Seb  fire fighter 😏
I’m thinking pole is gonna be somewhere in either on the really low 9s or maybe a really high 8.
Total Seb move to educate trackside officials on the proper class of fire extinguisher to have lol
Sebastian Vettel is: 4x world champion Strategist Firefighter Protector And more
Gonna be more boring race then SPA last weekend
guess this be crash  central
I want my money back chase
Mazes🅱️in to his grandchildren: This is where I was faster than Vettel
After what happened in Spa, I've never been so glad to see the sunny skies again 😌
what is your ambition in career? Vettel: YESSS! Grazie Regazzi!
Next Seb will make his own pit stops and be his own race engineer
1:04 so electrically live as in you could get electrocuted or  if moved  it could ruin the data collected by the car ??
Driver Seb Engineer Seb Race Director Seb Detective Seb Historian Seb Marshall Seb Fireman Seb  At this rate he is going to change his own tires someday.
ofc the F1 inspector would also have gotten firefighter training
1:11.500, very satisfying to my brain
Video is almost as long as the actual running time in FP1.
Vettel: **puts out a fire** Grosjean: Now hang on Seb, thats my thing
I think we will see a few DNFs in the race from overtake attempts. It's a small narrow track but it's not like Monaco, there's plenty of gravel to crash out onto.
Spinoda at it again
Introduction Seb : Marshall and firefighter
Pole is going to be so important here.
Yuki S🅱️innoda
He’s always on the scene, Fireman Seb And his Aston’s bright and green, Fireman Seb You cannot ignore Seb is the hero next door
Delete the SPA race result
Why nobody helped Vettel to estinguish the fire?? It's their job!
Lewis is great; really he is! 💪
Dude pls dont put that background voice.Pleaseeeeeeeeeee
What is that thing on yuki’s car?
Get in there, Lewis.
Seb: Love Your Cars. Literally
Ferrari P3-P4 Me: DON'T GIVE ME HOPE
Is Perez doing more than Albon and Gasly in that seat? I'm not so sure anymore.
How does the electric work? If it can't be touched when live, how can the driver touch it while driving or getting in or out?
1 sesja treningowa
We saw vettel again as a Marshal and an engineer.....
Perez is a liability
that bank...woohoooo
Firefighter sebastian to the rescue!
MAN THIS RACE IS GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN AND EXCITING.THE OVERTAKING AND CORNERS WERE REALLY TRICKY
Think they'll actually race this weekend?  Or just call it after FP2, award 1/4 points, and go off on vacation again?
are we gonna ignore ocon for pushing norris to the gravel? come on, we are the most hypocrites community in the world
Green car driver put out fire on the car, how ironic
Interesting tactic causing the red flag so don’t need to do the session
0:04 "I'm moving up and down,  side to side like a roller coaster."
Jeez how many jobs did vettel take? xD
1:31 So you're telling me that Esteban couldn't see the bright orange McLaren of Norris.
Tooooo long you get a car off the track
Leclerc and Sainz are starting to remind me of the Alesi Berger pairing, respectively. Let's hope they have better luck!
Lewis💓
Tsunoda: look at me. I'm the Mazepin now
Even when broken down, the Aston was still looking stunning.
Ferrari looking great, let’s go guys
broke: Mazepin woke: Spinoda
I quite surprise that back camera angle shows Seb's racing suit changes into RB color
This weekend 100 race win for sir lewis hamilton...GOooooo lewis
Perez lackin again 🤦
Seb giving tough competition to Johnny sins in the profession count
Hamilton with the slight flex in his season rival’s backyard lol
Go Ferrari ❤
Over  35 minutes to remove a single car from the side of the track. It's a yoke.
Can't wait for Sunday 👀
What was that on Tsunoda's car?
& Hamilton steals the show in just One-Shot Lap but let see on Sunday
Seb has more jobs than Johnny Sins
Took me long enough to notice that the kerbs are orange and white 🙏🏻😐
music?
It's Max' home & he's gonna win the Dutch GP
There's your topic for the next Tech Talk. Would love to watch an explanation of the ERS electrocution risk. And an explanation on why the marshals just stood there behind the barrier while Seb extinguishes whatever fire/source of fire in the car.
Cmon Perez! Time to shut these white xenophobic commentators up!
Firefighter seb  Kovalainen: Finally a worthy oponent!
I'm sure Alonso thought that  was hamilton overtaking him
Perez 💔💔💔
way to go race control on being so fixed to the rules you can’t freeze the clock while you deal with vettel’s car resulting in all that wasted time for the fans...
Rain for sunday anyone?
Alpine not bad
The best man will win this race, and i will enjoy this Zandvoort race, because it is high speed, and very technical, like it a lot.
Norris four tenths faster than Ricciardo while on mediums... :(
banked corners are unique in modern f1 looking forward to the race!
I'm announces yuki nicknames should be      -Spinoda-
Firefighter Seb hahahaha
Reporter: "How do you feel about the banking in Zandvoort Kimi?"  Kimi: "Mowa...... Normal"
Achievement unlocked: Firefighter
Waiting for the "Firefighter Seb" memes.
LETS GO LEWIS
Why does tsunoda drive with a „metal cage“ in front ?
New character unlocked: Firefighter Seb.
i mean i know fia got schedule to keep...but why is there 3 hours race limit(which they can suspend at will????) and why the watch wasnt stopped here? you cannot tell me the track is used in every single hour f1 is not on it...why all this problems with a freaking clock?
Carlos and Charles P3 and P4. We, Ferrari fans: Don't do this. Don't give us hope!
Will max crash to Hamilton just like Silverstone????🤔
Meh it will be  a boring race
ferrari at practice :top10 ( don't give me hope) future:ferrari at qualy : Q1/Q2- out  Spinoda strike again Seb , again show us that he's multitasker
hamilton there is no way you can go one on one with great micheal schumacher , micheal is the greatest driver of all time , he had a pure talent , if micheal had this weak competition , this merceders and drs , he would achived records that no one could beat but him , he was winning on dreadful ferrari something neither you or anyone else can do , unlike you he had the greatest competition ever without drs , in equal cars on his prime he would destroy ou
Fingers cross that it won't rain.
F1 is back in nertherland since 1985
oh boy less running i think we could see some tire problems... i hope not but with the banks and sandy track who knows...
Having orange-white curbs is just the most Dutch thing ever xD
Add firefighter to seb’s resume
Man, is there something Seb Vettel can't do ? What a legend
Seb as driver , engineer, medics team, fire rescue all departments 👑
hamiltons lap is the default lap you gotta beat to get the gold medal
I am a simple human. I see SEB. I hit like
"Firefighter Seb" I see, the editors are men of culture as well
Really YouTube? Triple unskippable adds🤬
Seb the firefighter
❤️ Seb
LETS GO HAMILTON🐐❤️
Ocon was not unsighted he looked to left and blocked Norris on purpose.
Seb can practically do anything!
I thought Lando was moving up and down, side to side like a roller coaster
I need a helmet cam on kimi
But lec more
This is why i love seb
Vettel another profession: FIREMAN.
Seb is a masterclass multitasker
This track looks insane 😻
So Banked corners are bad for the sensitive f1 car  Sliding on each banked section
Firefighter seb 🔥
What's missing for Seb jobs, cameraman?
Why do we have to wait two hours for the highlights 😫😫
Zanvoort has need the oval layout
I wish Verstappen can win the title. Hamilton is dominating a little too much for my liking. I think I am not alone in that argument.
This practice session just proved everybody wrong about overtaking at Zandvoort
maybe we should stop counting on how many Mazepin has spun, we should start counting on Tsunoda's now
I can't take any more red flags
Pov max does a Hamilton via crashing championship rival at home gp
Dutch GP
Spinoda keeping it rolling this season.
Ferrari: "Don't give me hope"
King Max ❤🇳🇱
Yuki is taking Mazepins role
Max max super max
People looks more thirsty even for FP1
this race is gonna be soo coool
0:12 Tsunoda got Deja Vu
Seb is also a marshall now
Fireman Seb 👩‍🚒
seb is a legend, and not only as a driver
Yuki Tsunoda is washed.
17th
1 min agoXD
First 300 people
Marshall Seb strikes again!
Words can’t describe how much I want Lewis to win his 100th at Max’s home GP. The meltdown would be surpreme
Smart strategy from Aston Martin causing a red flag so nobody has practice and Seb has no disadvantage 💚
I swear Tsunoda spins more than Mazespin
Yay
pole position for me
Max verstappen
Who else didn’t want to wake up at 5:30 am
Heh
