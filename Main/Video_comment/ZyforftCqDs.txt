And that right there is the reason why I don't like about Alma what she's asking for is impossible nobody is perfect We all half too fail at some point of are  lives
Bruno Madrigal Pedro Madrigal Luisa Madrigal Mirabel Madrigal Antonio Madrigal Julieta,Agustin Madrigal Felix Madrigal Mariano Doroles Madrigal Pape Madrigal Camilo Madrigal Isabela Madrigal Abuela Alma Madrigal The Good:
3:34
Bruno should be the least good.
I kinda predicted Bruno's situation of "misunderstood prophet" since there's a Pokémon with (supposedly) a similar ability.  The Pokémon Absol appears to people to warn them that something bad is going to happen but gets blamed as the cause of said bad situation.
Thinking what Bruno went through makes me wanna cry 😭
My favorite Encanto character is Mirabel

1. I agree with your ranking except for Delores. The Film Theorists speculate that Delores is actually the villain. It is a very interesting theory. 2. I’d like  to see them a spin off with Encanto and Frozen because Pepa and Elsa have similar powers.
I think you missed Casita. The house is absolutely a character in this film, she also doesn't out Bruno from his hiding place.
I love Encanto and some of the characters in it especially Mirabel, she's very relatable and she's very special to me. She's special with or without a gift plus Bruno definitely deserves the gold medal of most good.😁👍
Mirabel should be a lot lower on the list for messing Issabela up, although i do think she's pretty.
I love Mirabel
I didn't think of Pedro, I thought Casita was going to be in the top 3.
I don’t think Mirabel’s parents were dismissive of her feelings. When her mom thought she made the cracks up, she acknowledged that it has been hard for Mirabel to not have a power, and tries to help her feel special. If she were “emotionally dismissive”, she would have ignored her daughter’s feelings, not acknowledge them and try to make her feel better.
Robinfeather
Actually you'r right
"Ironically enough, the so-called black sheep of the family is the most good." Um no, that's not even remotely ironic when the family is toxic. Take it from me, a fellow scapegoat/black sheep. We leave because the family would break us if we stayed. I'm overjoyed that we finally have good representation in popular media. 💚
You spelled Camilo wrong AND put him in the wrong place in the list.
Amazing
ENCANTO
Wickedbinge each channel is so epic 10000/10
Strong and buff who is that that is Louisa yeah yeah yeah she can hold you for the longest time ever to be saying she can pick up a bridge it is like 1 pound for her she feels weak at the end of the movie she get weak and weak and then when she went back to get the donkeys it was heavy this is the story about Louisa
nice
I thought you weren't gonna talk about Bruno
*Mirabel isn't dissmissing isabelas feelings* Mirabel didn't even know about what isa was going through. And once she did she tried to use it as a chance to get isa to hug her but then enuorages her to be free. But isa knew what mirabel was going through and continued to pile on to her feelings
What part of Encanto is disgraceful do people not understand?!
I Don't Like Felix,He's Annoying To Hear.
To be fair you should put the people that killed Pedro in the evil area
I was fully expecting and hoping to see Mirabel at the top of the list and I am pleasantly surprised for that not to be the case. When you put Mirabel at #4 I was immediately like WAIT BUT WHO COULD BE LEFT? And it took me a second to realize we haven't talked about Bruno and we really need to talk about Bruno.  I feel like the first half of the list could easily be interpreted in several ways but I can't deny the top 5
DOLORES IS THE VILLAIN OF ENCANTO
i feel like antonio deserve the 🥇 of good
o now i no
We don’t talk about Bruno but we definitely sing about him lol
Abuela was a bad mum. If she really care about 3 kids she should have protected Bruno, but she turned the family and the town again him
You know, wasn't expecting bruno to be on top, but I'm happy for him.
I feel like you should watch film theory's video about Dolores but cool video 👌
Madrigal*
If you hadn't put Bruno at the top I might've thrown an ax through the screen.
I love juliata and Isabela   Why I love them  Julieta : obv when we see her she look so tired of make food for the ppl and for the family she is a caring and loveing mom around her eyes looks like she could doze of any moment because of this  Isabela : she may not seem nice at fist she does have a big heart marring mariano when she really didn't want to  Both try there best to.make ther family proud ( know wonder I cry every time I watch this movie  )
No, I don’t agree with you! I think Mirabel is the best character and Bruno is next!
Abuela Alma was just an overprotective narcissist. She isn’t a villain, but she was overdoing her family. Stupid.
Dolres needed to be in isabelas place
I love Pepa ❤ 🏵
After all the grief Mirabel was given for not having a gift, the least her family could've done was tell her the truth in regards to Bruno. She deserved that much at least. And Pepa, not talking about Bruno is basically lying to both Antonio and Mirabel, the former who wasn't even born yet, and the latter not having many memories of him due to being only five years old when he disappeared.
DOLORES IS A VILLAN
DOLORES IS A VILLAN
DOLLORES IS A VILLAN
DOLORES IS A VILLAN
i personally think abuela should be ranked above dolores (by that i mean dolores below abuela)
No Dolores is the worst check out film theory
abeula may be the one who caused the conflict, but remember she say her husband fricking die.
@WickedBinge: 2:34 - 3:52 That’s my favorite character
This is asome an is good
10:12
I thought mirabel was the kindest
I honestly think you could have made this video in your usual format because I think there are some characters who are not deserving to be labeled as good  First off, Abuela definitely deserves to be in the bad to evil section. I know she went through a lot, but that does not excuse her for forcing her family to live by her insane expectations, or treating Mirabel like a burden just because she has no gift, or kicking Bruno out of the family. Honestly I think Abuela is the villain of Encanto   Speaking of Encanto’s villains, if MatPat’s theory is true dolores can go here too lol  But in all seriousness, I think the gut guy should go here too since he blamed bruno because he was fat, when bruno was most likely telling him to change his eating habits, he also had to rub it in to Mirabel that she had no gift, like come on, as if she wasn’t insecure enough about not having a gift, what an asshole  Moving on to the grey area Isabela deserves to be in the grey area since she also treated Mirabel like a burden. I am going to cut her some slack since she was brainwashed by Abuela, and also since she improved towards the end of the movie  I think the fish lady and the bald preist should be just above Isabela in the grey area since they blamed bruno for their problems, their problems are more understandable than the gut guy’s since their problems were a little more out of control than the gut guy’s fatness  I think the kids should be next for pestering Mirabel about her gift, especially that one kid who told Mirabel that she should be sad that she has no gift, i’m gonna cut them some slack since they are just kids though   Camilo should also be in the grey area since he didn’t really do anything too good or too bad,   Pepa also deserves to be in grey area since she held a grudge on bruno for accidentally ruining her wedding  And MatPat joke aside, I honestly think there is something going on with Dolores, i get weird vibes from her, so I think she should round out the grey area  Now I think Mariano should start the good section and everyone else I didn’t mention is also in the good section in the same order as this list
Mirabel is like me: headstrong AF
Watch game theory
you forgot the casita
Dolores is the bad guy
Why someone saying papū
Dorlos I agree with but that was a theroy she doesn't mean it her girft it just hard she loves her family and friends  she so nice just don't linsin she loves most her gift is hard but she still my fav
We talk about bruno
Bruno
But dolores is a villan
PEPA is the best one becausus she is very emoshinol like me so i think pepa madrigal is the best madrigal
Dolores is not good at all. She does maliciously break the news to the family to cause a panic and knew her uncle was in the walls this whole time and says nothing
The most heroic is fish lady
11 seconds in and he says madrial-
Dolores is the villian
I Mostly agree, but i think the top 3 should go Luisa, Bruno, Mirabel. reply to tell me what u think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      hahaa i know you clicked the MORE     stop
Madri Al!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its called Mad-ri-gal
i agree
I wonder if this video would have been different had Wicked Binge watched Film Theory's theory about Delores being the one to break the miracle.
i dont think dolores is good bec she didnt say that bruno was in the walls.A real human being in the walls.And she was also the first to spread the news about the vision I DONT LIKE HER.   Isabela has more burdens than her and more pressure
WRONG Antonio is number 1
isnt it pronounced HOO-lee-et-uh?
Pedro is the best because he sacrificed for the family
Perdero is the best
0:44 WHY DID HE SAY MADRIGAL LIKE THATT IT MADE ME CRINGE
He said MADRIAL
Why are people in the comments saying Dolores is bad
DOLURES IS THE WORST SHE HAD BAD GIFT SO SHE TRY BREAK SPELL
0:34 dolores is the villain
3:54 you can’t put him that low. He is pressure is a must not be harmed
ISABELA!!!!!
I honestly wasn’t expecting Bruno at the top, especially after that “We don’t talk about Bruno meme.”
5:32 dolodoloreses
my rating: abeula, mariano, dolores, agustin, Camilo, Felix, pepa, juileta, Antonio, mirbela, bruno
Whether or not you believe Encanto has an antagonist/villain, overlooked concept in both discussions of this film or even in works in general, currently, is the concept of a tragic hero, and Abuela (sorry if that’s misspelled) Alma is, in some interpretation, is an example of a more modern version of a tragic hero.
im saying this now if dolores isnt in like the top 3 or something then this video is false
Bruno deserves 1st but Luisa should’ve probably got 2nd she did the most
I got a theory for Dolores maybe she has A certain amount of secrets she can keep
I LOVE DOLORES SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH
Can you please do a good to most good for jellystone
What about bruno
Oh my god kind buff girl and bruno the angel! 🤧😳
Uhh...Ty!🥇
I'm really happy you added luisa in top three since she doesn't get the attention she deserves, surprisingly,  lot of people actually ignore luisa's problems thinking that the other family members are in more dire need of help instead of her.
I love Isabela. The reason why I love her it's because her dress is so beautiful I want one. So Isabela is my fav character. ✨💗👩🏼😘🤩
you put Camilo very down low on the list I hate you
I agree
Bruno: your the real gift kid let us in
Ah yes, most good.
Thanks for the video :D
The fact that he says “Madrial” instead of “Madrigal” makes me laugh when he makes a bunch of videos about the movie without even knowing a word that an entire song is based off of
i agree with  what you said
Camilo deserves to be in the last place. I can't imagine having to stand his annoying ass every day lol
Casita should be in this list at #1. It seems like she is the only friend that Mirabel had after her 5th birthday. She also did heroic things on the climax, by saving the Madrigal family even when she's dying. The scene of Casita saving Mirabel from the house's debris is the most emotional part of this movie imo.
Casita should have been at the very least one of the most good. When she was dying she used her last breath to save Mirabel. If that’s not heroism, I don’t know what is
you forgot about dolores saying mirabel’s secret to ruin isabela’s proposal bec she liked mariano
Disney & Pixar Newest Movies: Worst to Best.
I watched this movie today for the first time! I ❤️ it!
I think Bruno got his loving self-sacrificing spirit that would protect Maribel from family criticism from his late father Pedro who sacrificed his life twice:     1: he sacrificed his life to save his children and wife     2: Pedro reincarnated as the Casita since his spirit left his body and immediately entered the magical candle and part of it also went into the Casita that sprung up from said candle.     Bruno felt comfortable hiding in the walls of Casita as he intuitively felt connected to it even though he was estranged from the rest of his critical family.
4:11 *yes*
The fact it’s Pepa and he says: Peipa
Bruno: im gonna get last place.. Also bruno:WAIT WHAT?!
Why is everyone calling ablela alma
Caista wins as most good character
I was like "I swear to god if you say bruno is like at the bottom of the list I will kill you" I expected mirabel at the top also u can tell I'm a big bruno fan he's my fave character
I really love that this movie shows that no one is perfect and everyone has flaws. In a lot of other Disney movies they seem to try to make the main character as perfect as possible
0:11 The Madrial family?
(7:36) Ah yes the floor is made out of floor
.
i agree altho i never seen the movie i still agreee bruno is veny much the most good
ur wrong isa and mira r bose jelos of etch athor so ya it,s a tiy betwen them
Madrial family lol BTW when I wrote madrial it corrected me to madrigal
Casita Is The Best!
I mean no hate, however, Camilo should have been higher. He was highly supportive of his brother's ceremony, greeting all guests personally and assisting with the decorations willingly. He was also one of the two, alongside Mirabel, who thought about the miracle as Casita was crumbling, almost killing himself just to save it. With all this evidence, I PERSONALLY (My Opinion) believe Camilo should be MUCH higher.
I don’t feel like Pepa is better than Camilo, Pepa is kind of toxic and such so I would rank Camilo higher, like have you seen in the We don’t talk about Bruno song? She is mad against Felix and Felix was being an angel against her
Julieta is Hu-lie-ta :) (Dude I'm good at reading!)
something I found interesting: Alma was introduced as the caring and wise advisor to the main character, and Bruno was introduced as a villain, but it turned out to be the other way around, with Bruno being the caring one and Alma being the antagonist
I feel like I’m a mix between Dolores, Luisa, Pepa, Bruno, and Mirabel  Reasons: Dolores - I do hear things, and over hear people talking Luisa- Idk my own strength but I can lift heavy objects Pepa- anxiety, depression, many emotions Bruno- personality wise, and my friends don’t talk about me  Mirabel- not always but usually the odd one out in many occasions
You say Hu-lieta not Ju-lieta THAT IS A FaCt
You don't need to put good ti evil fir these characters cause there is no villain
I HATE ABULEA ALMA 🤬😡 AND PERDO MADE A MISTAKE BY MARRING HER
I feel bad for Bruno, he was just trying to help!
i agree with it
#1 The lady who's fish died
I agree, Bruno is the best
I fink Isabel is the goodest
3:48 awwww 10:20 LMAO 13:19 Six Foot Frame, with rats along his head, when he calls you name, it all lights up with joy
Bruno Bruno Bruno ☺️
i would say casita is the most heroic because literally in the end mirabel wanted to get the candle and casita helped her AND when casita was gonna collapse and mirabel was inside casita put things ontop of her so she doesnt get hurt
Bruno was a good man okay who am I kidding the world doesn't deserve him but he deserves the world
3:04 Same. I could be pretty rude to my younger sister. (hehe)
1:09 what video is on how u find that
this is my own ranking of the encanto characters from good to most heroic 1. bruno 2. pedro 3. casita 4. mirabel  5. antonio  6. agustin  7. luisa  8. julieta 9. felix  10. camilo  11. dolores  12. isabela  13. pepa  14. abuela
Why isn’t anyone noticing on how Pedro and apparently “isabela’s husband” look alike? And Bruno deserves to be top,
No
I would say casita would be the best even though it is not a person I think it deserves at least #3 spot
Mirabel seem to have power is to the keeper of the house
Bruno is so precious, we must protect him at all cost
I thought he said wicked bitch😂
I think Felix should be higher than Augustin
Most heroic is Hernando because he isn't afraid of anything.
i looked nice.
I'm pretty sure there's a "g" in the name Madrigal .-.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Paper
How to not mispronounce the character:Julieta You see  "j" in Spanish make a "h" sound Witch means it's pronounced "Hulieta" Also it's the "Madrigals" not "Madrials"
I agree with all your rankings except that I think Dolores should be above Mariano. Also I think you should have included Casita as a character, I feel like it would have come in really high!
ITS NOT MADRIAL ITS MADRIGAL GAL GAL GAL GAL GAL
Not my fav isabella coming one of the last . Sad in real life I would be like isabella . Like how would u not get angry if someone ruins ur proposal . Instead of putting her lower u shouldve putt miracle lower tbh just because mirable, is the main character doesn't mean she doesn't do any mistake. Why the ___ would u break someone's proposal. And why put pepa and Dolores so low . Just because they can't control there powers doesn't mean u have to put her so low and it doesn't mean they don't  try   If I was u I would put the list like  Winner = Pedro & Bruno  1 luisa  2 julieta and augustine  3 Felix pepa Dolores  5 isabella & mirable ( even though isabella is my fav I can't lie and mirable may do some wrong things she did save them )  6 Antonio 7 alma
What about Jorge and Hernando? They were the heroes. They helped patch the walls
I knew Bruno was gonna be #1
I disagree that Bruno is the best, but I still think he's very good. I think that Antonio is the nicest character in the movie but that's just my opinion.
Wait why is Camilo ranked at the bottom that’s not fair he’s a funny guy
Bruno pog
Only thing I think wrong about the Mirabel part is that she actually asked if she should stop if what she is doing is hurting her family so that is not completely accurate when it is brought up in the video
I don't like stuck up characters Isabella 😒 just have a bad taste in my mouth
Bruno is good guy this whole time
Now we talk about bruno
It looks like r as in was a joke I think he said it was because she was sweating
Bruno also was mending the cracks on the walls for the 10 years he lived behind then, if not for him, Casita would have broken apart much earlier
I agree with all of them but the top three, I think bronze is Bruno, silver is Luisa, and gold is Pedro. Not to say I don't like Bruno, he's one of my faves, I just think Pedro has done more good than Bruno, and deserves the top spot. As for Luisa, I think she should be second because she helps the community the most. But anyway, that's just what I think, I know this video is opinion related, and I can't say any opinion is wrong.
Nah alma friggen evil
0:10 The *M A D R I A L* family
Kinda like of how Bruno was surprisingly most good Encanto character and he is played by John Leguizamo the voice of Sid the Sloth in Ice Age and the actor of Luigi in the infamous live action 1993 Mario movie who was also most good character for when you did the Mario movie
OPMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS I LOVE ITTTTTTTT
Luisa is the most heroic of them all
The grandmother, and Isabella is the villain here, idc what no one says, she's up there with scar to me.
how do you disrespecting cammilio
P
when i thought "most heroic character in encanto" i thought Mirabell its seems obvious, but then i thought.... wait.. whats more pure.. than a child? and i thought Antonio then you said "NOPE" and i thought "its gonna be mirabell or bruno"  also no i dont think it belongs to bruno, it belongs to... the rats. why? they are like family to bruno, and all they did was almost get eaten and talk about the problem with the magic, so the moral of the story is: RATS CUTE
I love how it goes Camilo, Pepe, Dolrase. Being one part of the family!
My mom says PLEASE LEARN to pronounce ETHNIC names CORRECTLY!!! Good video though. 👍🏿
5:20 that is not Bruno that is Hernando 🤠
hell nah calimo carried tbh
my sister was watching this and she thought he said PayPal when he started talking ab felix
This is probably the worst list I've seen
I would mostly agree except I would move up both isabella and camilo. They were the only other members of the family, next to mirabel, to try and help save the miracle and by extension help mirabel. Also when they are in the ruins camilos big brother mode activates as he imediatly starts worrying about his younger brother.
The most evil is actually whoever killed Pedro
You forgot that Isabella is narcissistic
Hi I'm a broccoli 🥦
Yies
Don’t wanna be rude but, Madrigal is pronounced Mad-ri-gal and Julieta is pronounced Hoo-Lee-eta
I love how Bruno is best boi. 💖✨
Wo
I have a theory that all of these characters live inside us. This movie is a therapy master class.  Camilo teaches us how to shake off other people imprints/energy with a head shake. (Tried and works)  Bruno is our gut feeling, 6th sense.  Mirabel’s mother is how we feed our body to keep it functioning well.  Luisa is our feminine/masculine energy (end of the movie used her feminine side like emotions, rest etc) (shows us that we need a balance between both energies. Deloris is our hearing/gossipy side obviously. Too tired to talk about other characters lol Moral of the story: We appreciate our gifts like gossipy, chameleon, perfection, strength etc but suppress our gut feeling just like bruno had to leave because of his prophecies. Okay bye ✌️
Please a normal to wakiest encanto list
I love how he says pa pa
Sffxddtxr
Leave a like if you agree that Bruno deserves the Gold Medal. Seriously he's done so much for the family.
In we don’t talk about Bruno Dolores states she can hear Bruno she didn’t wait until the end of the movie to tell her family
I love how he calls Pepa paper XD
I love how he calls Pepa paper XD
ok but are we gonna talk about his pronunciation?
3:53 Camilo is not a Madrigial 4:39 Pepa is not one either, now 5:25 Dolores, like Camilo, never had the Madrigial last name 6:42 Not Félix, either 9:08 or Antonio.
BRUNO IS THE BEST
Antonio should be before mirables parents since he didn't thank mirable for coming with him to the ceremony to get his gift. He also practically ignored or didn't care about mirable anymore after getting his powers. To prove this if he really cared he would have let mirabel join the photo they had of him getting powers since she definitely is a part of the family and even though she doesn't have powers neither does felix so why was he in the photo
Pepa should be all the way at the bottom because Bruno didn't do anything to make the weather change and at the end she accepted Bruno again but before he explained what happened therefore she was just faking because Bruno was there
me: *sees title* seems nice. *clicks* wb: *explains about the characters* also me: time to go 2x speed...
The main character isn't the most heroic, she deals with jealousy and envy
Camilo should be higher on the list, in the “Family Madrigal” song, he is seen helping a mother babysit their child while she rests. Not only that, but it is mentioned that he would do anything to make you smile. The biggest think though, is that he helps out amd calms down Pepa, his mother, in the part of the movie where she was super stressed.
I’ll also give it to you about the strong sister she is super pure
I think the most selfish character is the grandmother I think the guilty party is the one who hears everything One who is on the main scale but not totally ratty and more like Elsa it but anything would be her flower sister One who’s not quite as selfish and kind of sweet but also kind of crazy would be Bruno we don’t talk about Bruno tell me the next in my list would be the ship shaking brother and his other brother Next on the list is mother who heals things by cooking things she’s not as guilty having been the mother and a sweetheart who does care about her daughter except she didn’t do much to stick up for her that’s what makes her sort of on the guilty list tell me a next to my list would be in encata and the most innocent I believe would be her little brother my analysis the most innocent is enchanta and her brother
I’m in this movie the animal guyyyy
the mom and dad do there best for their daughters and it not just Mirabel.
No that was Hernando
Madrigal not Madriel
I agree with you ranking but I believe you should have put Mirabel for number two instead
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent you shall be saved give it a try I mean accepting Jesus is a great thing cause if you do your safe from hell you might think hell isn't real but it is and heaven isn't boring ppl think heaven is boring but in fact, you can fly in heaven accept Jesus as your Lord and savior repent and always remember God does Love you.
why Camilo and Pepa and Dolores and more so low on the fricken list this fricken ain't true
yOu fORgOt cOfFeE kID!!!
Top 2 cap Bruno should be 2nd and Pedro madrigal should 100% be no. 1, this dude literally sacrificed himself for his family.
No clouds in the sky but floating on her head
I just feel so bas for isabels ex fiancé for getting hit in the nose for no reason
Or not
Why is Bruno on the top
We need more films like Encanto that doesn't have a villain so people learn that people are gray and that we can't assign absolute morals to everyone and cancel them. The moral of Encanto is that we should communicate with each other and understand where each person is coming from. Communication and empathy is key to healing relationships. While we absolutely should cut toxic people from our lives, we shouldn't be so quick to judge and cut someone off without listening first.
Abuela always told Pepa to hold her emotions inside, but everyone needs to let their emotions out, so that's why she was a bit crazy and more stressed than others.
I don't agree with Isabela, she sacrificed her whole life for her family and she was always fake smiling, on the other hand mirabel could live her life smiling for real
You forgot to mention that Bruno, despite "leaving" so he wouldn't hurt anyone with his gift, still dedicated himself to fixing the cracks in the walls of the house
Bruno was a lot like the Greek seeress Cassandra who was shunned for only being able to foresee bad things but he never stopped loving his family while she killed herself
Bruno is like an ominous Jesus Christ who bears a heavy burden for the family.
I love Camilo and Bruno and pepa
"alma"  who is alma do you mean abuela?
This is a great video, but PLEASE learn how to not butcher these characters’ names. It’s not that difficult. Idk how Pepa is all of a sudden “pay-pa”.
Bruno didn't ruin Pepa and Felix wedding... he just said what will happen and Pepa knew it.
Sort of
I love encanto hehe
there is a villain who turns heroic who is it  pedro mirabel bruno isabella hint* The person is the main in a song
Why does everyone have a crush on Bruno
How dare you rank Felix so low. He and Augustin are the best dads. Augustin took his daughters side no matter what, and Felix taught his children to respect everyone
Camilo is stronger than Isabela because of what? Tossing a baby in the air?
Thanks for the gold medale
ok so we gonna talk about bruno
Huh, I would of guessed Bruno would be the most good. Anyways, I wonder has anybody seen Bruno in his song? Guessing, he heard his family talking about him and wanted to be included but doesn’t want his mother to see him.
U don’t disrespect my boy camilo like that he should be higherrr
Khalon: please make Hotel Transylvania 1, 2, 3, and 4; good to evil/good to most good
so true
Dolores gave Mirabeau  a clue by telling about rat talking in the wall but it is actually brono
Not because he's my favorite, but because if what I'll discuss further on, I believe Camilo was ranked a bit low? Like he always puts his family first. In multiple scenes he's rushing to his moms side and he's extremely supportive to Antonio. Also at the end when he appears to be trying to save the candle, the producers have explained that he was trying to save Mirabel, and not the candle, showing that he really would risk injury for his family. And later in the background you can hear him saying his gift is gone and almost immediately asks if Antonio is ok, dropping the subjects of what he would do, and instead going to his family's aid once again. At least the spot under his dad?
Bruno is my favorite character :-)
no offense but i cringed when he would mispronounce the more spanish names / words
I like how brono is first and how alma is last but the rest no
NO
CAMILIO IS THE BEST MADRIGAL
I am Jorge I make the spackle
Felix  seems like Mawni from Moana
I 100% agree.
I have a theory : abuela and mirabel where the ones who hold the miracle/encanto togheter so when the argued with abuela thats why the whole encanto just ripped apart even more
I love that there is a bottom of the good list, and it’s not villanizing Abuela, because after what she went through, of course she would put pressure on everyone, to make sure the miracle stays, in fear it’ll get destroyed and make her feel the same as losing her love of her life-
I think Dolores didn’t say anything that Bruno being in the walls because I think she was interested in Bruno acting out his love drama series in the walls
Who voiced abuela, imma kill her
I low-key hoped Abuela would die in the end XD
ENCANTO HAS A VILLAIN!!!   As we know (almost) every villain has some traumatic past that made him. In Encanto it is not so obvious, but there IS a villain - Abuela.   From Encanto you get feeling ,,Yes, abuela wasn't acting right, like whole her life after the miracle, but she had her own trauma, so... So it does not really count, ya know... Like she is not villain, just was making wrong things over and over..." I got that feeling too but when started to think about it kinda backwards... It just clicked. She is the villain.   When you have villain you can't understand the fa why he would do that??! Then you learn about some trauma he experienced and you understand him and feel sorry for him. Here it's the same. The only difference is that usually we have one movie with villain and we hate him for like six years and then there is his origin story movie and then we understand. Here we got it not after six years but sixty minutes. So we didn't really have that much time to hate her. But ABUELA IS THE VILLAIN.  Also also actually actually, as we know some villains at the end understand their evilness and stop. However they are still villains of the story of the movie. Like here.
Isabela had a huge weight on her shoulders trying to keep harmony. Camilo should be at the bottom of the list.
It's not alma. its Abuela
ALMA IS WHITE DIAMOND
I think Isabel is really nice
if abuela had a dollar for every time she was bias, the family wouldn’t need casita
When he said emotional when it was Louisa's turn he meant depression
I disagree with Isabella us ranking because she confessed that she isn't  perfect so she should have been higher.
In the eyes of Abuella Bruno has awful gift but for us Bruno have the most Extraordinary Gift and the most selfless one. Thank you Bruno you are my favorite character.
I think mirabels parents and camilio would rank higher. Good job though :)
I think agustín treats mirabel better because he knows how is it like not to have a gift  so he’s empathic
The best one is mirabel actually
As someone of mixed latinx (White and Peruvian) heritage, god this movie hits home. This movie nearly broke me
bruno is honestly THE best character and he deserves it. The part where he drew a plate so he could still eat with his family was heartbreaking
Ngl I feel like Isabella and Louisa should have switched songs just made it there own versions
I think dolores did talk about bruno..but everytime, everyone will break into a musical number
ok bro
The villain of this movie is hoplesness
I’d put the bottom two in the Gray Area
Abuela is a Disney villain. Argue with a wall
You forgot one more character and it was Casita!
Who else loved Isabella so much more when her song ended? Like she looked so bratty before
DOLORES IS COMPLETELY IN FRONT OF MARIONO >:( .
Abuela should be in the grey area
I think gold should have gone to casita. Even as it was falling apart it tried to protect mirabel and it was definitely sentient even though it was a house so it is technically a character
Camilo may be low on the list but he will always be number 1 on my list
I love Bruno so much! Like, soo much! I mean, Bruno hid away from the family he loved just to protect Mirabel, forcing himself to live in the walls. He heard everything they said about him, everything, but his loyalty to his family never faltered. When Mirabel and Aubela disappeared, Bruno saught them out on his own initiative to stop Aubela from blaming everything on Mirabel. I just love the part where he emerges from the woods and, despite his fear of Aubela rejecting him, he admited that he gave Mirabel a vision and tried to stop Aubela from blaming Mirabel. It was so wholesome! Bruno is also very funny, and I just love him so much!
I think Dolores should be lower, because of some of the “hidden lore” she had. So first off, as stated Dolores loves Isabella’s suitor, and because of this Dolores has tried making Isabella slowly not want to make her marry who she loves, saying “he wants 5 kids”. NOT TO MENTION who tells Camilo about Bruno at Isabella’s proposal? Now is this malicious? Obviously however I believe Dolores also knew about how Isabella didn’t love who she loved, because she can hear almost everything.
My only complaint here is that I feel a few characters should shift slightly like Mirabel and Luisa might need to be tied and I feel like Camilo and Pepa should swap. Only big one is that Mariano really didn't do much to deserve to be on the list imo he is good but he isn't like. He ain't do much
It’s mad rig al
Bruno should replac
Top 3: Jorge Top 2:Hernando Top 1: Bruno
Bruno isnt in this-
My favourite is Isabella just of the way she changes
Isabelle should have placed higher….
Camilla part in we don’t talk about Bruno is fire
I think mirabel should be 3rd place
We all know the grandma is a Sith Lord
So you're telling me she used a magical houses power to conquer a whole village sounds like a Sith to me
I think you should put Isabela higher.
WHERE IS CASITA
“ThE mAdRiAl FaMiLy” “ThE cRaCkS iN tHe MaDrIAl HoMe”
How they see bruno: Dangerous bad  Howw bruno actully is: *As dumb as a stick*
imagine being dolora and hearing someone do some stuff with another person who is the opposite gender in bed
Camilo is my favourite character in an animated movie
Bruno was back there alone for a decade it’s understandable he went a little crazy.   Probably waiting and listening for his family talking about and wanting him back or just worrying about him.
Bruno truly is his father’s son. Down to his willingness to sacrifice himself for the sake of those he loves
Is it me or did I think Antonio was a girl
Camilo is the best
You're white
Bruno’s story was so unfair
That grandma can take a long walk off a short pier with a concrete ball strapped to her ankle
Ok
I agree
I’m so happy Bruno got the best cause he is really a amazing character and loyal and mirabel also just sometimes pushes some things aside that are important
Bruno is like Absol. Absol predicts and tries to warn people of disasters but is known for causing it
wait what about caseta
Dolores should have been at the top
You don’t  pronounce it right it’s hu-lee-eta and ab-wel-a
I’d say I agree with this list pretty well.  I’d put Lisa a little lower and Antonio and Maribel a bit higher but other then that I’m pretty happy with it
The amount of incorrect pronunciations in this hurt me
Did this boi just say majrial?
I would replace Camilo with Pepa 😑 she was a selfish AF definitely not a good sister
Bruno is best character for life
no I want to show like five timesI don’t think there’s other shows is great I think oh I just love this when Anthony says for the nerve and gives toy lying to Bruno insert for the nurse you know the lien repeats back just listen carefully
I agree with them all but camilo deserves 1st place
I mean... calling her judgy over Isabella is a bit hard. As someone familiar with Sister's feud, all Isabella's interactions (before the hug song) with Mirabel were caustic. Also, while singing the "Madrigal Family", the only debatable thing she said about her sister is that she is a "Prima Donna"... which she is. Other than that, she portrayed Isabella as Isabella showed herself. Isabella was really harsh.  #1 - CASITA.
I would naturally put Camilo higher in the list. :)
Isabella should be more up there. I can understand her being uptight, imagine the pressure of having to be a perfect kid your whole life when you actually dont feel happiness inside. Also her wanting to marry someone she doesn't love without hesitation for the sake of the family is a huge selfless action.  Maribel's parents should be more down below. I agree they don't really try to communicate Mirabel's feeling, they just sugarcoat it with hugs and kisses and "you are just as special". They also dont even remember about Mirabel -their own child,who they already knew were having a tough time in Antonio's party- in the scene when they all taking photo after Antonio got his room. It looks like they care for a while and then forgot about her once they are all partying and having a great time.  Mariano should be waayyy more down below. He switched from Isa to Dolores so fast without even trying to know more about her, but just because she is the one that knows a lot about him. Major red flag
I think Bruno‘s should be where Antonio is and I think Antonio should be where Bruno is🤗😬😂🙏🏻👍🏻
This is new
No one was evil and Im glad this list recognized this. But Bruno definitely deserves the top spot as he sacrificed everything to do what he thought was right and continued to be a good person.
I would switch Dolores and Pepa.
Bruno: A good selfless character The rest of the family: We DoN't TaLk AbOuT bRuNo
I agree.
My list would be  Abuela Delores  Camilo Isabella Ti peppa Mariano Felix Tio bruno  Julieta  Augustine Luisa Antonio Mriabel Abuelo
Abela is a selfish cow 🐄
They are not conquistardores, the story is more recent, it takes part in "La violencia", where millions of colombians were forced to abondon their houses
In a deleted scene, bruno supposedly had gotten into a fight with abuela and left which was the original reason why he left the family
I don’t think abuela is a good person, I don’t care what anybody else thinks
I love this list btw! But I’ve gotta say, with Julieta I don’t think she was dismissive of Mirabel’s feelings, when she told her she’s perfect the way she is, she’s meaning it as she doesn’t want her to feel like you need a gift to be great. Sure when we’re in that moment of doubting ourselves our parents do tell us things we don’t want to hear but something we need to hear. She’s a very good mother and understanding to Mirabel.
P
Cool video
Camilo should be on top
Camilo should be on the top
Bruno could have easily turned into villain, I have more hate on abuela than Bruno does how is he so kind enough to love his family despite them being so unsupportive
Lmao “Conquistadors”. Has this guy never taken a world history class?
This man rlly calling it the Madriall family 💀
The only thing you missed regarding Bruno is he was also repairing the cracks in the Casita within the walls. Likely has been for years before Mirabel found him. I also noticed how when he was escaping the Casita as it was being destroyed, he didn't reveal himself to the family and found an exit away from them. Likely situational than intentional but still kept himself hidden until confronting Abuela.
I think Isabela is my favorite, I think she's misunderstood and I freaking love her.
Walled encanto 2
Encanto is most Carter’s good type of show I love your Chanel I hope there’s even  a thing
Mariano was a bit too "lovey dovey" in my opinion, and not in a good way. Right after Delores confessed to him he jumped to "let's get married" and even Delores was slightly taken back by it. He may be a good guy but that doesn't make him a "good" character because his character revolves around his overly romantic antics. Yes he takes care of his mother and writes poetry but thats all we know about him because all he does in the movie is be creepily attracted to both Isabella and Delores and quickly switching from one to the other with little to no second thought. (Also just a nit pick but the pronunciations are a bit too off. I can excuse a few but "Julietta" is obviously pronounced with a H sound. And "pepa" is pronounced the same way as "peppa". Not to mention its madrigal not "mad-ray-el")
This video just got 1 million views just from a month ago
Technically the curse is the villain because it made the house shake and crack
Im sorry but,madrial💀
I would swap Mirabel and Luisa cause they are both really good but I feel that Mirabel really cares about everyone and always trys to help
I think the mom doesn't have a gift  don't all mothers cooking heal people
Sorry, I get thrown for a loop every time I hear "Madrial." There's a G in there lol.
It's not madrial  it's marginal 😠😡
It's so understandable that isabella was angry at Mirabel, she ruined her proposal. And just because Isabella didn't want to marry him in the first place, that moment would be still so important to her.
The best actually should go to Pedro
camilo should #1 for relativeness 🤣
Abuela was a good woman, she just didn’t see that it was the familia that was special, not their gifts, until Mirabel told her off and the casita fell.
Merabelles gift is that she basically is the miracle  Evidence: every time she is a negative emotion and is fighting with the family the house starts to crack but when everyone is happy (mainly her) the house is fine.🙂
Bruno the one guy everyone needs but doesn’t have
You said their last name wrong and I was like RRRRRAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEE
I'm a tad concerned that Mariano was the only one who seemed to be genuinely worried about Mirabel in the proposal scene. Everyone else just seemed like, "Yeah. She's the family weirdo." But I do agree with the rankings.
Bruno is the physical embodyment of the phrase: "i live inside your walls"
We don't talk about Bruno 😱
12:39 Pedro madrial??? where is the g
Camilo should be ranked higher
I stayed because I found it funny the mispronunciation of Madrigal. then I noticed something: what you thing are "conquistadors" are not, they are a sort of representation of a violent time where Liberals and Conservative politics parties meant to exterminate each other. My grandfather was sent to the Korean war because the ruling government was conservative and he was a liberal. his mother was killed by the conservative party. look up "frente nacional" on wikipedia. On the other hand "conquistadors" where spanish guys. that's it they are from another country , and usually had some kind of armor.
I love how Bruno is pictured the exact opposite of what he really is. My favourite moment is the part of the song where Camilo talks about his "7 foot frame" and we end up seeing Bruno as the shortest sibling out of the 3
Anybody who had the maturity and consciousness to realize that Bruno LITERALLY DISAPPEARED and made zero attempts to find and help him should be at the bottom of this list. Pepa and Abuela especially.  He was gone for 10 fucking years because they thought the absolute Saint of a man was intentionally ruining their lives.
I would switch spots with pepper and camilo
While this film is great for Hispanic representation, the pressure from family crosses every nationality
Mad-ri-gal
good to evil abuela be like ok I'm getting 1# no matter what
NO NO NO NO Camilo is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
U r terrible at pronouncing Spanish names
Tiny adjustment. It wasnt Mirabelle  causing the cracks. She was exposing the damage to her family and how unstable and unhealthy the dynamics are. THE HOUSE NEEDED TO BREAK so a better healthy one could take its place
Unpopular opinion. I HATE the grandmother. She reminds me of my grandmother. Abusive and controlling and manipulative. Her redemption arc was not enough for me. That may be the bitterness that my grandmother didnt change or care when I said almost the same thing as Mirabelle
Bruno likes like he’s related to mal with the glowing green eyes
I feel camilo would be ranked over pepa n Dolores. Pepa acts a bit like mom too, but cmon Dolores couldn't keep the secret n kinda made things worse
"he was killed by conquistadors" yeah right remember that time Spain conquered an already spanish speaking Colombia in the 1900's. With an army (conquistadors) that were from the year XV and XVI. Wtf
About Agustin, He was not dishonest, He was gonna tell the family but only after the guests leave. He was not going to ruin Isabella's night and he was not going to embarrass the family.
Camilo is great! I LOVE him
There actually is a villian, the person who killed abuela’s boyfriend.
gonna be honest. seems like all the men except Bruno are bit higher on the list than they should be. and Isabela got a bad wrap in this. especially since it seems like she came around the fastest once she realized she could make something other than "perfect" flowers. her entire character and personality shifted once she could let go and still be more than accepted by Mirabel.
I think pepa/Pepa’s husband is the most pure.
I Agree with you at most parts, but I really think luisa and the grandfather should switch places, we haven’t seen much out of him which means we don’t either know much about his personality, I think Luisa would have tried to save the family aswelll
Anyone nooticed it was hair challange music?
It is not alma it is abuela
Remember children: *Trauma is not an excuse for abuse*
Isabella is deserving to be above her grandmother because she is the first one out of the 2 to feel more regret
Bruno kinda make me feel like me. I am not mentally stable at all and school is not helping 🥲👍🏽
I felt the saddest for Bruno and Luisa 😞🥲
I feel like at the four most good characters it should have been most good pedro, then mirabelle, bruno, and then luisa😶, I mean mirabelle did save the miracle, and only meant well while luisa was under a lot of pressure only because of abuela, not because she wanted to
the only good thing about encanto is the music i dont know why it's so popular
Mah-dree-gahl not mah-dree-al
Okay, but where does coffee kid come in?
He said "Madrial family." ✋🏻😭 Someone help
12:48 It’s not set far enough in the past for them to have been conquistadors
At 7:29 he said “As such she is an honest guy”
Bro did you say the "madrial" family? 😂
*Peppa Madrigal*
You aren't even saying the name MADRIGAL right lol
I know her Abuela runs the household but she’s kind of a little bit mean 😢🥲😥🤬
I know her Abuela runs the household but she’s a little mean 😪
I know her Abuela runs the household but she’s kind of 😭
I only watched this movie 2 hours ago and I’m already nostalgic
Tio Felix reminds me of my tio Ronald a fun loving uncle who is honest and always caring for his wife and kids
Most good is gonna be the grandfather, second place will be Bruno, and below that will be Mirabel. Also, Bruno exists and there is a "Bruno" character in Pixar's Luca... hmm   Ok, so I was a bit wrong... but when you think of it, isn't the house itself one of the most pure characters?
I agree Bruno is the best
It’s pronounced madri -gal
I love how the americans pronounce every single word that's not in English 😂  This isn't sarcasm or anything like that my american friends! We really love when you try to learn new languages and about our cultures! Lot's of love from Brazil ❤️
The directer said that Camilo when mirabel was getting the candle when the house fell Camilo tried to save mirabel
He said it wrong
Bruno also patched up the crakes
Abuleta is NOT good!
At first I thought the father had gotten the gold medal and the line "we don't talk about bruno" shot through my head.
Am i tripping or did u forget luisa
How is Antonio not number 1?
WAIT IM SORRY... THE CAPTIONS THOUGHT YOUR NAME WAS A CURSE 0:22
MadriGal*** not Madrial
Amoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogus
please learn how to pronounce names :) your lack of effort is borderline offensive
I feel like Pepa should be a little lower on the list and Camilo higher.   Pepa shows obvious distain for Maribel and caused a lot of problems, being hush hush about Bruno for so long and assisting in pushing the narrative (like Alma does) that Bruno causes harm.  Although, I can see she’s super troubled and doesn’t seem so open about talking because of the way alma tells her to shush about her emotions/ powers.
i feel like camilo should have been higher
Why do you say madrijal it’s madrigal
Omg he butchered Madrigal so bad-
PLEASE IM NOT A BOT. IM TRYING TO SPREAD A MESSAGE!!!!!!
Why didn't you put mirabel  at the top
Madrial😂😂  Honey it's MadriGAL
"Hello Bruno from JoJo." "Hello Bruno from Encanto."
💖💖💖💖
This movie just blown up in my area and I'm really happy about it 💕
I think Isabella should be a little higher because she was willing to sacrifice her choice of men just to please her family
It's not madrial it's madrigal.  And it's pronounced Hulieta not Julieta
I hate the fact this dude doesn't even bothered to open a book of history of Colombia to do this, Alma and José weren't scaping from conquistators, she has that attitud becuase of the trauma of being displaced from her home and watching his husband die by machete (wich is the hell of a death, many people don't die at the first hit) and many other things that are wrong, also the Americans (gringos as I call them) in the coment section are truly desinformated about all of this stuff, is really sad and annoying
I liked Isabella and Camilla so I wish they were ranked a bit higher.
I think the most powerful powers are: shape-shift, see the future, can hear from a far away distance,  healing, super strength, and talk to animals. But if I have to get my power, it would be time control or invisibility. You can go to the future, reverse time, slow down time, completely FREEZE the time and more OR you can go invisible simply sneaking off or confuse your enemy (if you ever have one) and eavesdrop without them knowing.  But if you were to choose your superpowers, what would it be?
Suicide Squad 2021 good to evil
What about Hernando? Or hoze, you know, the one who made the spackle?(this is a joke)
Bruno is best. By a landslide.
One of the few disney films that I genuinely think needs a sequel. The cast has a lot of potential
You know it’s kinda messed up that in the movie she says whatever gift you get will be just as special as you. You are way more special than some power!
I think Pepa and Camilo should be switched. Camilo has a good heart and wants to help everyone around him. There’s a lyric in the opening song that says “My primo Camilo won’t stop until he makes you smile today.” And I like that so much. I think that some of Pepa’s reasons for disliking Bruno are kind of unjust, and she doesn’t accept that it was partially her fault for causing the hurricane on her wedding day. Bruno was trying to calm her down by making a joke, because he could see that she was nervous. She got even more nervous which then caused a hurricane, and she then blamed it on Bruno. I think Camilo and Pepa should be switched, just saying.
I personally think that Dolores is better than Isabelle because being perfect doesn’t mean that they are the best
Bro the villain is obviously the not special guy at the beginning of the movie
I disagree, the clear villian in this movie is absolutely Abuela. She drives her family to embody their gifts instead of seeing the gifts as true gifts. The generational trauma and abuse in this movie is one of the key themes.
I really feel like Isabela should have been higher up on the list and Pepa should have been lower, that’s just my opinion.
There’s another line in the starting song (forgot the name) where Mirabel said “My primo Camilo won’t stop until he makes you smile today”
Next could be FNAF:Security Breach characters
´´ im the strong one im not nervous. ´´
Isabella is the middle child luisa is the oldest
Hi guys are you ready for the day and a half day
My 3rd favorite movie
Even though I mostly agree with you,I have to replace Isabella with Dolores and vice versa. The reason why I rate Dolores lower than her mother is because she makes herself selfish in order to not hold everything for herself. For example,in the end of the opening song,Dolores willingly says the kids that Mirabel didn't get a gift,which would lead us to the fact that even though she allows herself to suffer in silence,she'd rather have her cousin,Mirabel suffering than suffering herself. And if she really can hear everything,why can't she just keep them for herself? She needs to keep a secret,for the sake of Mirabel and instead,she literally has the whole family saying it to each other. Can't blame the rest of the family,she started it. Her mother,Pepa at least does TRY to control her power,but Dolores never tried to control it because what she is a selfish gossiper. Now,about Isabella: What she did was for the sake of the family,not because of her own selfish reasons. Unlike Dolores,she allowed herself to suffer with the expectation of being perfect and never complained about it. She could've said: "I'm done,I don't want to be perfect!" but she never did. She never thought about herself,what she did was for the good of the family,not because she wanted to be what everyone expected her to be. Unlike Dolores,she isn't a selfish monster who'd rather have everyone suffering for her. And her gift is much more positive. Also,it was logical for her to say to Mirabel that she hates her after she ruined her fiance`e's proposal attempt,because she was willing to marry him to make her family proud,not because she wanted to marry him. Even though she dosen't seem interested in men in general,she was willing to marry a man to please her family. This is what I like in her.
My favorite part of the movie was the attention to detail with family genetics. Which traits showed up in each of the children, and having unique characteristics while still being similar to the parents
I think this is the first disney movie that you see that came with a whole set of family members!❤️🙏🏾 And i love that! In this movie you see the grandma, her children, the grandkids, cousins , parents, aunts and uncles like everyone! Lol and I think this is the first disney movie that showed a big family like this! And getting to know everyone! Other disney movies we didn’t get to see that as much.. or a big family like this throughout the whole movie.
The house is the purest character and will always be my number 1😌
Okay I totally agree with the last one 😁
Dolores should be next to abuela. Shes a little shit. She kept quiet about bruno HOW LONG but blabbering abiut the prophecy how quick?
MAH DRII GAL hearing the wrong pronunciation hurts
bruno diss track so goo, even bruno is vibing to it
Most heroic is Antonio he’s a little angel
What’s up with Disney hatin’ on Bruno’s lmao
I have I headcanon that in the end when all of the townspeople helped them build the up house again, it was not because they wanted to but because Dolores blackmailed them since she can literally hear people talking from a mile away
3:09 Isabela doesn't have a fiance because like you said the proposal was an attempt not the real thing.
Guys explanation:  Mirabel does have a gift, her gift is the house. As you see she said ‘floors’ and the floors changed, she said ‘draws’ and the draws opened, this is probably true, but it’s just my opinion you can tell me otherwise.
I feel like Félix should’ve been way higher and I feel like you- WickedBinge’s Kyle- need to watch the movie to where you know how to pronounce the names
"The majrelz" lol    Not hating
Encanto 2? Please:)???
I’m sorry for anyone who like’s abuela, but I really hate her and absolutely think she is a villain. Sorry I had to get that off my chest. There is a lot more I would say but I don’t have time for that.
I dont mean to be that person but, its not that fuckin hard to pronounce character’s names right
Not sister has already watched the movie 4 times
Dolores my fave
😀😃😀🙂🙃
So happy
I never noticed how much I was like maribel-
Just saying, Mirabel’s mother’s name is, “Hull-EE-e-TA”
no way he put Isabella at second to last. I understood at first that she was a complete b*tch at first but she was willing to marry a dude she didn't even like for the family. I would have put the walmart Storm at second to bottom imo. But i do believe that Isabella has to be at least ranked higher
So I just figured this out. Abuela gave birth to Augustine, Pepa, and Bruno. Augustine married someone who doesn’t have powers. Pepa married someone who doesn’t have powers.  Bruno is single. The reason Maribel doesn’t have powers is because of her father and uncle don’t have powers so she has no powers.
Im so happy that Bruno is the most good. He is my fouvire character.
honestly i found Abuela to be a “villain” type character and very controlling
When you said Bruno had a vision of  Peppeas wedding you were wrong because when Bruno is singing he says that it wasn’t a vision he just saw that she was stressing you were right about how he wanted peppea to let the stress out though so good job
i mean i agree w the list (maybe not camilos placement but yk) but az a hispanic person there waz no attempt to pronounce even the names right </3
Okay but Bruno intentionally told his sister who's emotions are tied to her gift that "it looks like rain." I know its not intentional but like come on. Be smart. Keep it to yourself. You know your sister has anxiety and her day can be ruined by her own emotions. Even his explanation of it didnt make too much since to me. But other than that I like him as a character.
Felix is a great father/husband
The cool uncle should have been higher by a lot
dolores is the best in my opinion
She was not trying to prove her self she wanted to know about Bruno
I cried when I saw Bruno’s loneliness and the fact that he had a table with a plate that had his name so he could still eat with his family just broke my heart When I saw how happy they were to see Bruno again at the end I cried for so long it was so wholesome
I love the top 3 🥺🥺
The family doesn't deserve Bruno, from hiding the future to protect mirabel to living alone in the walls for years, he shows no grudge on anyone. This poor guy was shuned from the village and the family he loved just because they thought he decided the future and WANTED bad things to happen 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bruno's like Absol. They both get bullied and cast out of communities for their ability to foretell bad events with the premise of "you brought this upon us, it's your fault". Even though they can just know what's going to happen and just want to warn people.
Camilo is my spirit animal
I would like to point out that isabella is only really a golden child to their grandmother, the parents clearly care about all kids and see them as equal.
You should’ve added the nonhuman characters since they had distinct personalities and impact on the plot. The casa, the rats, the donkeys, and my favorite character the capybara that gave absolutely no F*s  the entire time.
You know this movie hit different when the bottom of the list is still good
am I the only one who is annoyed by the way he says “Madrigal”?
min 12:46 conquistadors ? really ? The problem with Colombia are civil wars and armed conflicts, nothing to do with Spain
I only cried at Casita dying 😂 the house was the purest for me Even when she's dying she was trying to protect them
How dare you put Dolores that low
I feel like Camilo deserves a slightly higher ranking on the list because, when the house was cracking and falling apart, he tried his best to save the candle and help his family  I also think that you can’t really blame him for his personality because he is after all a teenager.
I think Abuela is evil, i think she emotional manipulating, at the end.
IMO; Dolores should be higher on the list
Camilo definitely deserves to be a lot higher on the list, hes one of the most kind funny and friendly to the townspeople in the whole movie, and his amount of screen time shouldn't affect how we perceive his characters goodness. and Isabella was showed more stuck up throughout the beginning, but i like to think this is because were supposed to be seeing in the perspective of Mirabell. so when she hated Isabella, we were supposed to hate her, and when she realizes Isabella isn't as '' perfect '' as everyone perceives her as. i think she and camilo definitely deserve to be a lot higher on this list. at least higher than the bottom 3, like come on..
To people saying Isabella is a bitch with dozens of explaination as if they know her how about put yourself in her shoes. Sisters bicker I myself as oldest love teasing my younger brother but it doesn't mean that I don't love him it's my way showing attention. Second yes Isabella might have said I hate you to Mirabel but in that situation Isabella would be totally mad she hit Mariano and Mariano's family has no idea about what was happening to them Isabella just hit Mariano's face. Imagine doing that to your parents colleagues hitting them on the face infront of your parents plus it's also the expectance of Abuela. Second people saying why don't she fight back tell her parents so they'll fight for her. Heck if only that was easy then millions of people be out of depression. As we grow older we tend to want to be independent or probably she doesn't want them to be worried. Her parents worried more about Mirabel. She's old enough yes but does her parents ever ask "Isabella are you sure?" No! She wasn't ask. To her parents it might also be great for her to marry Mariano cause Mariano isn't a bad person. Plus they're more concern for Mirabel being giftless and bout the vision than her. Third Mirabel didn't voice out her emotions. She didn't complain to Isabella and how would Isabella know she has her own problem. May I ask while you guys have depression or a bad day have you ever thought your friends or family fine no! Because you have own problems to reconsider. Isabella is vocal and being vocal is important than to vent up your insecurities and problems with one person.   Am not making Mirabel bad she's a human being she has imperfections along with Isabella she's imperfect every character in Encanto has their own flaws and imperfections. That's what's make them special don't try to antagonize Isabella just because you think it's so simple. Encanto is no Cinderella were the Villains are purely evil they have their reasons
Bruno was such a suprise character. Genuinely love him
Did you just call her alma?
Fun fact Luisa is one of the older sisters in Mexico when girls are older sisters pressure is put on the older sisters having to take care of everything it also explains her song
My favourite  character is camileo
0:11 im sorry did u just say madrial? u keep calling abuela, ama lol
encanto is just my hero academia on steroids and columbian
i know Isabella's mindset was just heavily influenced by Abuela but damn, she's 21 years old being very vocal about how she hates Mirabel, her 15 year old younger sister who just wants to help.
You mispronouncing madrigal hurts my soul
You mispronouncing madrigal hurts my soul
= every character is good and disney isnt exclusive
why do you say madrigal as médriel
I hate you
Bruno is my favorite
Ok just a reminder it's huletia ( that's how you pronounce it
He also fixed the walls while hiding
Imagine pepa when she was pregnant 👁👄👁 probably tsunamis
Only one bad person in the movie!
The purity and honesty of Bruno is like that of a god. So I have no complaints for you to make him the most heroic cause he deserves it. A real hero acts out of heart not fame.
Bro really said “Alma” or “albule” it’s frickin Abuela
BRO! DOLORES SAID NOTHING ABOUT BRUNO FOR 10 YEARS and couldn’t keep one secret for Mirabel for 2 minutes
It's crazy that I seem to be a mix of Luisa, Isabella, Mirabelle & Bruno all in one with a tiny bit of the others sprinkled in too. I'm always the first to help no questions asked. Carrying a heavy load like Luisa. Feeling like everything has to be down to me to carry and keeping going. Afraid to let anyone help for fear of being seen as weak, worthless or lazy. Never wanting to let anyone down.  To my youngest sister she's always seen me as the perfect sister. For whom nothing can go wrong. Like Isabella I feel like I've been stuck in the routine of having to be perfect. I can't show my true self as everyone expects me to be a certain way. But on the occasions I do break out and let myself be me it's amazing.   In regards to Mirabelle the love I have for my family is fierce. So fierce that I would literally risk my life for them. But feels like I am constantly trying to prove how serious I am about that. Like Mirabelle I've had members of my own family who make me feel like a burden. That I'm just in the way. Despite how I am treated and even though I do get to the point that I want to explode then hide away. I still have hope that somehow those family members will see that they don't have to be that way towards me. That we can fix the broke foundations and start again.  Finally Bruno. Just like him I have a big heart. I notice things that others don't and sometimes when I try to help it's taken the wrong way. In many ways I am also the black sheep of the family. That just wants people to understand me and that I mean no harm. That I never set out to ruin anyone's day. Never have never will. But not everyone sees it that way. Like Bruno in many ways I feel isolated from some members of my family. They are in sight, maybe at arms reach but yet so far. Just like Bruno I find myself longing to feel like I belong. To be seen for who I am. Faults and all. A person with a big heart who always strives to help not hurt. Not someone who's misunderstood.
Ok I have to disagree because I think Luisa should’ve been at the top. It’s clear that Bruno leaving caused distress, yes, but I would’ve ranked him silver because he did eventually end up leaving. This at the movie proves that in a way it also hurt the family even when unintentional. You could argue that his selflessness is why he left, but Luisa *stayed* even when her powers were being lost.   She’d either be silver or gold imo.
I agree, except I think Luisa is the most heroic.
Madrigal not madrial
Dolores: *Here’s Bruno in the walls* Dolores: SILENCIO BRUNO! Bruno: *Sniff sniff* no one ever remembers
I think Antonio is better than Mirabel. Just a thought
Mf said the "madrial family" 💀
brunos like my fav character he's funny and kind
I agree that Bruno is great BUT Casita should of been number 1
You should make a theory that is  How does Luisa know that something is wrong with the house when only Mirabel knew
Its abuela not alma and its madrigal family not madial
I feel really bad for Delores cause she can here EVERYTHING she can probably hear me now in like two scenes she was literally covering her ears
Felix is the most perfect husband I've ever seen in a Disney film
Y’all ranked Pepa above Camilo? She caused the hurricane at her own wedding and blamed it on Bruno. Camilo is much much MUCH better than Pepa. I’d even argue that Pepa was only a little bit better than Abuela.
Abeula was just straight up abusive lmao
ANTONIO IS EASILY NUMBER ONE
The closest thing to a antagonist in this film is the soliders in the beginning
I love Bruno ❤️ He deserves the title of the most pure encanto character
Is it just me or does anyone else get the vibes that Bruno is just…..     Not entirely straight? I don’t know man.
"madrial" It's pronounced "MAJ-ree-gall"
NOO I feel bad for Camilo
I think the tiger is the purest. Just saying
alma BAHAHAHAHAHA
I completely agree with the rankings!!! Just one note: Julieta’s name, while spelled as Jewel-ee-et-ah, is actually pronounced Hool-ee-et-a, with the J being somewhat silent.
Bruno is my favorite character and I freaked out when he was first 😋 we love bruno
Very epic
In my opinion, Mariano should be ranked lower. Not like Alma low, but he wasn't seen much and didn't play really any part except for dating Dolores.
Listening to you butcher those names repeatedly kinda hurt my ears. Paper?
You guys should do a Video where which marigal character would win squid game
Why am I so low on the list? I’m sorry I used my gift🤡
Mad-dri-gal, get it right
Honestly, I think Dolores should have gone a teeny bit higher on the list. Besides putting aside her feelings for Isabela, she's the only one that never insults or says anything mean to any of the characters. Like in "We Don't Talk About Bruno", she wasn't talking bad about Bruno. She simply stated what living with Bruno was like for her, and even sympathized with him. All in all, Dolores seemed to be more "good" than Felix.  Edit: "Dolor" is Spanish for pain, and the name "Dolores" literally means "pains." Dolores indeed does face a few pains throughout the movie: 1. As mentioned before, she selflessly withheld her feelings for Mariano, instead wanting her cousin Isabela to marry him. 2. If Dolores can hear Luisa's eye twitching, she must be able to hear everything that ever happens in the family, everything said, anything noisy that happens, etc. so it must be pretty hard for Dolores to process everything she hears, if she can't choose what to and what not to hear. 3. Bruno left just after Mirabel's failed Gift ceremony. She was 5 then, and the movie takes place when she is 15. Therefore, Bruno has been living inside the walls for 10 years. Dolores must have been able to hear him sneaking around, as hinted in her part in "We Don't Talk About Bruno." She kept Bruno's secret for a whole decade. Despite these challenges, Dolores manages to always seem cheerful and never says anything mean or rude throughout the whole movie.
I think antonio could have gotten a higher ranking
Note: if miracle let the house die, she would no longer be the outcast
anyone notice isabella and mariano look like abuela when she is young and abuelo
Lol it's fact time did you know that Pedro Madrigal died if he didn't well they would just be a normal family if he hadn't sacrificed himself
Encanto Gifts: 😭Cursed to Blessed😃 Most Cursed: Pepa’s Mood Weather  Most Blessed: Isabella’s Chlorokinesis
Agreed!!! Bruno is the best
I am the 1000th comment :)
conquistadors??? Jesus man... get a history book...
I would disagree on the point about Isabella thinking less of Mirabel because of her not having powers. To be honest I think it's the other way around. I feel her chagrin came from the fact she was probably a little jealous that she didn't have any expectations placed on her. Still a bad reason to treat her sister the way that she did, but more understandable, I think.
shh we dont talk about bruno
You should do the most emotionally damage listing
Felix gets points for the hilarious song line “No clouds allowed in the sky.” His playful sarcasm is a hint to Mirabel that he thinks everyone is overreacting about Bruno.
Cool list. I’d knock Luisa down for using a sword on Cerberus in her fantasy. Superheroes don’t kill animals, they are powerful enough to find nonviolent solutions. This is the equivalent of Superman laser-vaporizing an angry bull in a bullfighting arena. Luisa could have just as easily chased Cerberus away with a show of strength, or freed him from being used for bloodsport entertainment. A shameful oversight by the animators, they could have benefited having a vegan on the writing team.
I think Casita should be included on this list.
I agree with most of the rankings, but the one I least understood was Mirabel’s rank. I don’t think Mirabel is forth. Even though it was Abuela’s fault the house started to break, the cracks were caused by Mirabel. She also has many faults like being stubborn or careless. She is quite jealous about the other’s powers, even though she hides it, and judges others because of it (mainly Isabella). I think she should be just below her parents!
Hey, Just putting this out there since its triggering me. Its not En can tou. Its en ca nto. (Pronunciation.) It's spanish for love.
I hope they make an encanto 2
nobodys talking about his pronounciation of j's, spanish names and words have j's make more of an h sound, its more like hulieta rather than julieta
Hiii
The number one evil spot belongs to the soldiers that killed Pedro
BRO THE FAMILY IS CLEARLY FRAMING BRUNO. ITS NOT HIM THAT TUINED THE WEDDING ITS SO CLEAR. THATS OBVIOUSLY HERNANDO
I watched Encanto on Disney plus on Christmas Eve and I loved it because of the songs and because of Mirabel and Luisa. Luisa is my favorite.
Bruno was my favorite character immediately when I first saw him in the movie without knowing he wasn't evil. I only loved him exponentially more in every scene
NO ABUELA IS A VILLIAN. makes it so much more intersting calling her the villian
Camillo shoulve been a few places up, atleast in front of Pepa. hes a prankster, sure. but not in abad way. him putting Mirabel down softly after singing his bit in We dont talk about Bruno is just too pure
Abuela was my least favourite because of how she treated mirabel and Bruno despite she made amends with those two at the end.   Isabella is the typical popular pretty stuck up girl.
you forgot the bruno is the one fixing the crack
I completely agree Bruno is the sweetest character when he saw the vision he left to save mirabel and he never meant to hurt anyone he just wanted to help but they saw him as bad I often wonder what it was like for him before he exiled himself I’m going to assume pepa had the grudge and that everyone thought of him as bad still
The only thing that i 'd change in the list is that i would swap Pedro and Bruno's spot because, at least to me, there is no sacrifice bigger than sacrificing your own life for another person and he did it for his family's safety. I am not diminishing Bruno's sacrifice in any way, he still is, an incredible selfless person, willing to exile himself and live in solitude and sadness to protect his family from his gift. Thus is truly a virtuous act. But even with less screentime, Pedro did the ultimate sacrifice, and the seed of his sacrifice is the wonderful family that followed and that's why i can take a little bit of Alma's side in the story. (Although i agree 100% that she needs to be on the botton) I know she is in the wrong and end up learning from her mistakes, but the fear of losing her family just like she lost her husband is something i can pretty much undestand.
I like your opinions but if I did the list it would be like this: Abuela Isabella Pepa Felix Mirabels dad (forgot his name) Camilo Julietta Antonio Mirabel Bruno
I think that the parents of mirabel deserve to top rank as they were to most supportive for mirabel (besides Bruno) and they were supportive for everybody aswell
I agree with bruno being the most heroic encanto character
I think abluea
Yeah I really couldn't care less, I really dont like the grandmother. Yeah, sorry not sorry
Who in Encanto would win the Squid Game
“And there’s no real villain in the movie,” Abuela in the first half of the movie: Am I a joke to you?!
I think Isabella should be ranked higher because she had to keep being someone who she wasn’t
ITS ABULEA NOT AMA
Camilo was the best character!
Abuela is definitely a very toxic woman.
horghe makes the spackle.
There are about 4 types of people in this comment section.  1: "Oh come on! Isabella is definitely better than stupid Pepa!"  2: "Does Casita not count?🥺" 3: "Camilo deserves more screen time." / "Lol Camilo is my first ever Disney Crush. 🙈" 4: "ALL HAIL RAT MAN!"
in julietas you dont pronounce the j as a j you say it as h sound
i dont agree on everything but i agree on bruno isabellas and Alma
I’m sorry but I have to point this out but you messed up most of the names not all but most of them
‘ being a teenager ‘ EXACTLY PEOPLE!!! CAMILO IS LITERALLY FIFTEEN BUT THERE ARE FULL GROWN ADULTS SIMPING FOR HIM!
I think it's clear that Disney/Pixar hates people named Bruno.
I think the house should be included in this list.
I wonder where some of these characters would've ranked in "Disney Magic Users: Weak to Powerful" if that video had been made after Encanto's release.
I'm not the only one who sees Felix and wonders whether they reused parts of Maui's mesh for him, am I?
I think Camilo is underrated.
I don’t think the grandma is good
I agree where you put felix because he does keep Pepa happy and in the song we don't talk about Bruno it shows he's really the only one who can calm her
It's not Madrial.  It's Madrigal
If u could hear anything how do you sleep, if one person is playing a loud game on there phone or watching tv its gonna amplified to you 👀
I love the movie but I feel like Mirabel's cousins were underutilized. Is Camilo hiding pain behind his mischievous demeanor? If so, what are his worries? Dolores is CRIMINALLY underutilized. Dolores' gift is not all that useful in everyday life. In the family montage she was not exactly shown helping people. Mirabel only talked about how she knew everything about everyone because of her hearing. What if she was somewhat like Mirabel in the sense that she had a gift but it wasn't as useful as everyone else's? I would have loved to see how Mirabel and Dolores would interact in that regard.
In my opinion, I agree with most of them, but not Isabela's ex-fiance/Dolore's boyfriend, or where Pepa is (I would have expected her to be a little lower.) Overall, the ranking I can agree with. Encanto is such a good movie.
The grandma is rude
I think Pepa should be ranked higher, but other then that it looks really good
It’s the Latin version of Beauty and the Beast.  Since both have a living castle or house.
When they said that Mirabel was 4th I asked myself who was getting in Grandpa or House
I didn’t see the capybara in the character rating list
I really wish Camilo had gotten more screen time. Being the comic relief of the family has it's own burdens. Not to mention he probably has a lot of identity issues. Not only is he a teenager who'd likely be questioning who he is, but everyone he knows always asks him to be someone else.
0:03 *Sofia Vergara's house?*
I am SO happy you gave Bruno number one!!
The moment when the light hit the scribbled plate did me in. Y'all, i bawled
So much I love about this movie. However one thing I did really like was that the fiancée (Mariano?} never became a twist villain like I was expecting. He fit the character well and I was surprised that he had no ill will
It's MadriGAL With a G
He probably head them sing "We dont talk about Bruno" song 😭
I think you should have put Camilo second to the bottom  because HE DID NOTHING.
I'm surprised about Camilo's placing. thats not just because im a simp- i just think he seens to be a good family member and cares about his family, he's a bit sarcastic and mischievous and what not i get it, but for a kid his age he's pretty cool. like my all my friends are rude to their parents and family and stuff and he's very different
Antonio is the Phil (tpn) of Encanto
Mira didn’t get a power because she was born with a power.  The power of communication.  I know what you’re thinking. “Everyone can talk in Encanto!” That’s not what i meant.  I meant she is very good at conveying messages and thoughts. When Luisa is upset and tells Mira about it, when Mira is with her, and telling Luisa she can relax and stop, Luisa is strongest. When Mira leaves, and Luisa begins doubting her Gift, she loses her gift.
I’m realizing how much of a disadvantage Dolores gift actually is. Everyone else gets the cool gifts and what not, but  she can hear rats talking through the walls 💀
Wait ... The people who killed abuelo Pedro weren't conquistadors as he says. They were people who killed other people based on a political party, families were forced to leave everything behind in order to survive.   It happened to my grandmother when she was a little girl, they were lucky and all our family survived, but just as it happened to abuelo Pedro a lot of people didn't make it.   The conquistadors arriving to Colombia were waaaay before.  So yeah, just wanted to make sure to get that fact right.
What i like is that this movie shows it doesn't take ill intent, or carelesness to harm people with your actions.
Disney ripped my heart out with bruno having to sit and eat dinner across a wall from his family who were happy he was gone. Like come on he didn't deserve nothing that happened to him
ik this guy did not call them the madrial family 0:09
honorable mentions to the house who literally does its best to save everyone as its dying
I find it kinda sad how people portray bruno as a bringer of misfortune, when in actuality he tries to protect them from it. just imagine seeing the future and seeing all of the bad things that happen to your beloved family. you try to protect them from it but they all shun you for your expression of your love and care. despite this, bruno still loves his family so much and hes not really as pessimistic as you'd think someone that could see the future would be
man said madrial
bruno ...... he is a brave yet misunderstood man he does earn the gold
Is it surprising that my uncles are exactly like bruno? One’s dead but still
I feel like Camilo should be ranked higher just because he’s the best charecter in the movie
I honestly think that they should have ranked Pepa bellow Camelio, It felt as though throughout the movie Pepa was on le of the ones most openly hostile towards Mirabelle, purposely or not.
Madrial? XDDDD
I feel like Camilo should be higher up. Not only does he help a lot of people, but near the end of the movie, when the house is falling apart and mirabel is running to the candle, most people try to run away from the falling building. Camilo, on the other hand, is the only one who runs toward mirabel to try to save her, even though he doesn’t end up getting there
I felt sorry for Bruno and he was my favorite character in the movie. Loved his them song:  We don't talk about Bruno.
I'm pretty sure the grandfather wasn't killed by conquistadors, but rather by radicals from a more modern civil war
I know why maribell doesn't have a gift. It's cause she is the glue for the family!!!
I feel like Luisa and Maribel should be switched but overall good list
you forgot the most important character in the story––casita! i think casita and bruno should be tied for first because casita was caring for her family even whilst she was crumbling to the ground (when she protected mirabel with random parts of the home right before she completely "died")
The grandma was EVIL! She only saw your granddaughters and walking ovaries with the potential of expanding her families power(s) and influence.
Bruno as the #1  good character is only right
BRUNO DEZERVES THE WHOLD LITERAL WORLD TRY TO CONVINCE ME I DARE YOU
I dont think bruno is the nicest i think louisa is
I always kind of theorized that Casita was the spirit of Pedro watching over his family
Feel bad for my guy, Bruno, he just predicting the future not making the future 😩..
Šdfdrefgd
I realized two members of the Madrigal family sacrifice themselves for their family Bruno and Abuelo Pedro .
You didn’t rank you donkeys :(((((
i absolutely adore camilo’s role in encanto. he’s wonderful and i love the interpretation that can be taken into their character
Madrigal! Not madrial
Agustin Has the power to get stung by bees a lot that’s why his ear and nose and hand
Guys, the Abuela was an abuser. She straight up traumatized most of the family, and no, the fact that her husband died doesn't change anything, she was a bad person during the entire movie and a small "I'm sorry" is not going to change the fact that she treated Mirabel like she was a mistake
So you know, the family's name is Madrigal 🙂 It sounds like you are pronouncing it as 'Madriel'.  (Unless maybe that is how it is said in certain countries / languages?)
I completly agree with the list. I'm glad you didn't put mirabel to the first place because she's the main character. Just a note: julieta is said as ,,hulieta"
Actually I wouldn't put bruno top of the list like I mean he gives his family bad visions that's not a thing someone good would do. I think Mirabel should be the one who deserves the gold medal of heroic like I mean yes I know she doesn't have powers at all, but she is willing to fight hard and is determined to learn her true power.
Mirable and Isabella have a very normal older sister younger sister relationship all siblings display hate towards each other
I think you should've given Bruno a "Platinum" medal rather than a gold medal.
2:07 Mawii? idk how to spell his name its that dude from moana
i wonder when the madrigal family will have so many members about 40% of all earths inhabitants have powers
Not conquistadors, almas and Pedro's deal represent armed conflict and forced displacement within Colombia
Wtf is a mad dree all
Alma is so underrated! She went through so much grief, pain, and fear for atleast 30 years! She has to raise her three kids alone, Casita was the only one with her. She never forgot about Bruno, she loves her family but feels that things need to be perfect or else they'll fall apart.
You wanna know who the villain in his movie is?  THAT F-ING BAND IN TOWN.  THEY WERE DAMN WELL OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER MIRABEL'S CEREMONY DIDN'T WORK AND THEY STILL TOSSED OLE GIRL THAT ACCORDION WITH FACES OF ANTICIPATION.   KNOWING DAMN WELL SHE DON'T HAVE A GIFT!
Yes
I don’t agree
I thought Mirabel was supposed to earn First Place - Gold Medal 🥇 NOT Bruno, although she's the Star Of The Movie.
Bruno, taht name is giving me luca vibes.... SELNCIO BRUONO....
🌩☁️Pepe🌈 ☀️     and     🥮🍪julita🩺🍵     And    ⏳⏰ Bruno🔮⌛️ we’re born at the same rime
Mirbels mom and Pepe and Bruno were born at the same time
This is the beauty of the film: there is no villain. Just a family of mostly good people having trouble understanding each other.
He's not wrong about Luisa's song being a total bop( idk how to spell her name lmao)
Ma-dree-gal
List  (up being good, bottom being the most good Abuela  Isabela Camilo Pepa Dolores Mariano Felix  Julieta & Agustín  Antonio Mirabel Luisa Pedro Bruno
Another good point for Luisa: In the made-up scenarios in her song, she's always protecting Mirabel, sometimes even putting herself in harm's way. That shows how much she loves her little sister.
Irrelevant but seriouly abuela was literally the worst
So, Bruno is Absol?
I hate you you are saying midragal wrong
Immediately no, Delores deserves better
I would’ve ranked Isabelle higher, although yes, she was very flawed. She was actually one of the most selfless characters, she was willing to throw away her interests and feelings to fit the standard of being the most perfect, even willing to marry a man she didn’t love and have FIVE kids with him.
Bruno is sort of like Sirius black from Harry Potter. Their character design is similar, they were both like the black sheep of the family, and people thought both of them were evil and scary, but they were really nice and caring.
I agree
Bruno is a representation of "Being evil is a choice". Bruno has suffered so much, is disgraced, Discriminated, falsely accused, gossipped, and almost disowned by everyone specifically his family. Still, he chose to be Good.
I'd die for Luisa and Bruno
Spoilers
Also if you notice in the family tree Bruno’s painting was faded, which added to the neglect he received. The repainted everyone else’s except his, it just makes me sad that he was just forgotten man.
Lion King next !
We don’t talk about Bruno
I haven’t seen the entire movie but i was super annoyed Mirabel ruined her sister’s engagement I know Isabel didn’t want to marry him but they literally could have waited ONE day to let all this loose
?
My favorites are Camilo, Antonio and Bruno.  I agree with the list mostly, but I guess Felix could've been a bit higher.
Imagine marry a men who look line Markplier
Wait wait wait but there is a villan in the movie:Alma    Just joking      But there are villans       The guys that killed Pedro
Did Bruno see a vision that mirabel wouldn't get a gift
Mirabel, Antonio and brouno all have the same hair
I think marbel power is evry song  a animals will be ther to I think

Well both mirabel and bruno are the most good characters!
ummm you called pepa ......... paper
😉LOL
OMG!
Agustín only wanted to hide the prophecy until Mariano and his family was gone, which is a sound decision so I wouldn't hold that against him. It's not his fault that Dolores couldn't hold it in any longer and told everyone in the middle of dinner
isabella? who's that? i only know sister nature
This movie makes me think of what remains of Edith finch a bit. But less depressing lol
•••••
so... it wasnt conquistadors... it was the conflicto armado, whit out telling wich part exactly (coul be the guerilla, the paramilitars, even the militars tho i doubt the would go fll machete having guns tho) i found that people outside of colombia do think this are conquistadores or españoles or what ever but look at their clothes, aldo those arent sables those are machetes and whe ben o war for mani mani years that it coulbe any part of the conflicto armado... please chec it out for better context inside the movie
Ok so I haven’t seen the movie yet so no spoilers for me but I’ve seen clips I think it would have been really cool if Bruno didn’t have visions or powers at all. It would make him much more relatable and flow with his situation(to my knowledge) with mirabel. I think the family members in we don’t talk about Bruno kind of just told how he predicted things the average person with common sense could predict. So It would’ve cool if they just assumed he had powers when he didn’t Again I haven’t seen it so he might not have them but everything I’ve watched seems to say he does have powers

I actully think Mirabell got a power of singing and helping people 'just saying
Mirabel should have been above Luisa (not saying Luisa didn't deserve her spot obviously)
I     I IM      KATIE
CAT   TY
Good observations.  Correction: Pedro was not killed by conquistadors. Conquistadors were around nearly 4 centuries earlier.
Bruno reminds me of my Messiah Jesus Christ...just look at his appearance...  sorry , i can't help myself to keep silence about this, me had to talk about it.  because his character really outcast but very lovable he tell the truth because he had seen it all from the beginning to the last day ,  with his emotionally mentally imbalance broke down and door slam, mark as self sacrifice just to stop flare up his own power to hurt the love ones that beside the wall... he is more powerful than the other rest but he remind harmony. he don't want to hurt Mirabel decision to this family ,  he saw the best of both side and let her decide ,  thank God that Mirabel choose positive way to help her family , and make Bruno back home again.  i feel his pain in the whole movie because in my family ,i myself also similar to Bruno lifestyle , hiding with close door and wall yet still knows what is actually going on at outside. i may look dead and silent but my intuition insight is not dead yet.
It isnt Madriel its Madrigal
HEHE My name is Alma
I immediately knew Bruno was going to be my favorite character
I was wondering who's the actual villan and turns out to be Abuela Can somebody actually explain why tho and   Yes I have another theory what if Mirabelle was actually the one chosen to have the power of life such as making things broken back to reality and good quality just like how she saved the house I think
I feel like I relate with Bruno the most out of all the characters, I definitely see a lot of myself in him.
Ok in my opinion i would switch bruno with his dad because if bruno's dad hadn't sacrificed himself bruno and every one else would have died and all the good stuff he did would'nt have happened just in my opinion.
Great. Just great. MY NAME IS ISABEL! I'M THE STUCK UP ONE!
My Little Pony Good To Evil Pls
Idk why, but Bruno reminds me of Hector from Coco
Anyone notice how they say mirabel is the only one without powers Just look at mirabel's dad and uncle they are also powerless
“She knows everything about everyone”  “That’s why her hair is so big. It’s full of seeecrets”
YESSS BRUNO BEING THE BEST SO TRUEEE
I absolutely loved this movie 😭♥️
Why mariano is so up on the list😆?
Pedro wasn't killed by conquistadores wtf, I he died in the 1000 days war, a colombian civil war that happened in the first part of the xx century. It's beautiful to see the effort and the amount of research they did.
Great vid but the Spanish  Pronunciation is pretty bad
i hope that mirabel has a gift and be a disney princess soon.
My favorite and one of the top-3 most heroic characters is actually… Casita. I don’t know how much of a character it actually is, but it’s sad that Casita got overlooked. 1) It’s basically an invisible member of the family (as much as it’s possible when you’re a colorful magical villa). It has it’s own mind, it communicates and it participates in the family life. 2) Unlike with other Madrigals - Casita’s source of powers is not only due to magic or miracle, but also the family union. That’s why it starts cracking when family’s not ok. And gets back to life when family is happy and healthy together. 3) Equally to other family members Casita is just a helpless witness and a victim of events that took place in the film. Casita doesn’t know what’s happening, why or how to help it. Has no control over what’s happening to it itself. But still is willing to help when it can. 4) Finally, the fact that I noted but still overlooked while watching film, but realized a couple hours later and started bowling. When the Casita finally crushes down - it’s helpless. It can’t fix cracks at the walls or prevent ceiling from crushing anymore due to source of magic slowly dying. But with those last now-unfulfillable magical powers Casita still can move smaller objects like flooring and chairs. And it uses it at the moment of crisis. It helps Mirabel to get up initially, but as soon as it gets clear that you can’t save both - family and magical source - along with the other family members Casita sets the priorities correctly. Family is more important than magical candle. Casita easily could just do something like catapulting candle out of the house to keep it safe, we’ve seen it throwing stuff around before, but instead it uses its lessening powers to create floor waves to get the family out of the house; and at the final moments of its destruction Casita uses its very last bits of magic to create a shield to save Mirabel when the whole house comes crushing down on her. It does not protect the magical candle - the source of Casita’s own existence - it saves Mirabel’s LIFE with the last bits of magic it has before Casita essentially dies. Casita might not be a human, but it is a heroic member of Madrigal family.
Bruno deserves the world 🤧💗💗
HOW DARE YOU PUT CAMILO LESS PURE
Why do i feel like feminisme being push in my face?
My favorite character is Bruno what’s yours?
Best character is missing : the house. I know Casita is probably the warm part of Alma's personality she's repressing. But the way the house always help, feel worried and protect people make it unique and a whole real character on its own.
OH NO DOLORES SUFFERING IN SILENCE :(
I think mirabelle has a power when ever she hides the truth bad things happen
yeeeeeeeee Bruno he's my favorite
Automatic Bruno. Abandoned everything he loved so his niece can live a peaceful life
I should be studying for finals... but I'm here... Great video by the way :v
I agree
The only problem with Bruno is that he told Dolores that the love of her life was going to marry another man. That itself would not be too bad if she wasn't under the age of 10 at that time. Telling your niece that when she is just a small child is flat-out weird
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😁😁😁😁🤩🤩🤩🤩👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
anyone else mad about the pronunciation
it's madriGal not madrial
**EASTER EGG** In the song We Don't Talk About Bruno, at 2:20 onwards Dolores says (her singing is getting lower or more faint because Isabel is singing her line above hers), "It's like I hear him now (Bruno)....it's like I can hear him now. I can hear him NOW!".
I would have put Isabela a little higher, but great video :’)
Yes 👍
Could you do new girl?
You pronounce the character names really badly. Please work on that.
The thing is the rain scene in the wedding was actually a good one, it means good luck and is also shed to be the last tears that the bride will shed for the rest of her life.
Oma abula
I hope you know you're spoiling this for me I have not watched the movie and how do you know this
I find it funny you guys assume it was conquerors who killed Abuelo Pedro. Though it is not clear, the Madrigals were most likely victims of forced displacement, meaning the people who took the village were either part of a guerrilla like "Las FARC" or a paramilitary group like "Las UCM". Forced displacement is a key characteristic of the armed conflict in Colombia's history, their village was most likely turned into a coca farm.
Just thinking about it, with their powers the Madrigals could have been some kind of tyrannical overlords. Easily.
To be honest I think none of the characters are evil soo I think this guy is wrong soo yeah
I really think Pepa and Camilo should be switched- Pepa was mean most of the movie, at the very least she was rash and judgmental for no good reason. And Camilo was literally just a goofy teenaged boy- I don't see why Pepa would be more pure than him 😂
5:58 I don't think she kept that secret, i guess nobody believed her and she just gave up in trying to convince everyone, people tend to forget that she's probably a teenager, then her parents probably said "Ok dear" and went on with their lifes. On the ending of the movie she told Camilo that she was right about Bruno being in the house, probably hinting that she already said that but nobody believed her
I don't think it was really fair the part about Peppa, imagine a person can't have any kind of negative emotion, she can't fell anger, sadness, anxiety, because all of that will result in bad weather, I can't even imagine how much she have to bottle her emotions and pretend she doesn't feel the things she feel
I feel like Pepa's power makes A LOT of sense in Colombia's weather since the sun can be radiating furiously in the mornings and it can be storming by noon. It's very unpredictable and I feel like it was on purpose
Ok but what were Antonio's animals doing. I saw the movie a week ago so I can't remember everything they did but one group of his animals literally put the puzzle pieces together and presented Abuela the pieces. He may not be as pure as we think lol. his animals were definitely stirring the pot.
Bruno needs the world not the world needs Bruno
Luisa?
It's just reminds me that we spent years making excuses for ourselves. Saying the same thing it's just a lack of understanding, you know ignorance. But the truth is people always looking for someone to blame. People cannot be happy unless they have a villain. If we don't have at least one person to hate. If not something that doesn't exist, kind of some imaginary enemy. The truth is that we will turn on each other.
It’s the madrigal family not the mardial
We don't talk about bruno
Pepa and felix are the perfect example of how to write about a straight couple. They love each other, and do everything to each other, they are not clichê and fit perfect in the story of the movie.
Even though it's confirmed that Bruno is the antagonist I still feel like it's abuela alma
Bruno is a dilf period.
People say Bruno’s the villain but he is not
I honestly feel like Pedro should be switched with Bruno in my opinion,Pedro legit sacrificed his LIFE for alma,not saying that Bruno is bad but I feel like Pedro should get some more Recognition
The Proud Family Good to Evil next
My Little Pony: A New Generation – Least Good to Most Good (in order) Sprout, Queen Haven, Alphabittle, Phyllis Cloverleaf, Cloudpuff, Pipp, Zipp, Hitch, Izzy, Sunny, Argyle
Depending on the time period this was in (alma lived through conquistadors so this IS a while ago) the fact he only gave bad news would make people in a time period think he’s a bad omen. I forgot the monkeys name but there’s one in either Madagascar that because it has a longer middle finger they thought it was a bad omen. So it would make sense if in that time they’d see him as a bad omen because of his gift. If it was modern times they’d understand and he’d probably be number two next to alma for head of house because of his gift 😕 but that’s why it’s set in the time it was.
Encanto just needed more Camilo
Where can i watch this full movie plsss
I want dolores powers it can be really helpfull

I hate your pronunciation
I think Isabela is actually jealous of Mirabel because of the latter's absence of the 'gift' which is the only latter's burden and doesn't required to be 'perfect' just like Isabel.
I enjoyed this movie so much. All the characters were so good but I thought Camilo deserved more screentime. he is such an interesting character! i would love to know more about him.
I had a feeling that Bruno would be a misunderstood character from the trailers, but I was utterly unprepared for how self-sacrificing and GOOD of a character he turned out to be. Every detail I found out about him made me empathize and like him more with the song "We Don't Talk About Bruno" feeling more and more horrifying despite how catchy it was because he was STILL their family member at the end of the day and no one even bothered to look for him nonetheless everything with his power. Like you said, the fact that he didn't grow bitter and kept such a pure heart through all those circumstances is incredible and he deserves all the love 💚
My favorite character is Dolores, just I love the vibe she got on where she could always hear Bruno but never said anything
Anyone noticing how some of their powers somehow have a 'negative' side? Like with Pepa if she feels negative emotions the weather will mess up. Isabela can grow flowers that aren't colourful and pretty and maybe Antonio not only can talk to animals but also control them? Not everyone can do anything just because you talk to them right?
What about casita
#0:10
Honestly I loved everything about this movie the characters were all great the songs were great the story I just loved it so much, my favorite Disney movie ever.
Good video amigo, thank you!  But certainly were not the conquistadors who disappear the Madrigal's patriarca.
Bruno: the face of neurodivergentcy
the two husbands have no power they don't get made fun of but mirabel why her she is a gem is my question
Me realizing bruno is 1: ok soo were gonna talk about bruno?
I feel so bad for Bruno..everyone hated him because of his power to see the future they see him as a dangerous person because they thought that when Bruno said something like tells the town that a snowstorm is happening in a few minutes, everyone thinks that he’s causing them exept for mirabel and her mom who think positive about him even pepa Bruno’s brother,hated him for “ruining” her wedding it’s so unfair for him 😢
Sorry not a hate comment but just a language check Isabella is pronounced esa_bella and it’s midabell but thanks for the video😊
Conquistadors in this late in time
As a note you called Isabella Maribel's OLDEST sister, but that's not true. Louisa is the oldest of the three with Isabella being in the middle!   Isabella also didn't see Maribel as in the way. It's later stated through a whole song how she's jealous of how imperfect Maribel gets to be. It's also shown in that song that she doesn't like the way her grandmother Alma thinks and that she doesn't agree with the strict guidelines set out for her or the rest of the family.
They did Bruno right by doing him wrong.
Bruno my beloved
Personally I would put Pepa as second least, then Isabella as third leaset and then Camilo as fourth least  Pepa was the one person to repeat the "we do not talk about Bruno" thing in the movie. The thing that made her kids probably think so too. Though seeing as to how fast she accepted Bruno back in I think that she probably felt guilt about never clearing that between them and that she was worried about him, so to not think about that she probably used the more negative side to not think about that.  Isabella definitely isn't worse than Pepa. Both her and Maribel were rude towards each other. I think she was possibly most effected by her grandmother's want of perfection, especially of her, especially because she's the oldest.  And Camilo, well Camilo is just a good (and hot) boy. He didn't have any actual negativity. Even him singing about Bruno felt like someone trying to scare someone else like telling a story and he definitely just took the little bit he remembered (which wouldn't be much seeing as him also only being 5 when Bruno left) and the stuff he was told and made it a bit scarier. Plus did you see how carefully he handled Maribel? I think other than her parents (and Bruno?) that was the most gentle anyone was to Maribel. Plus he's a sweetheart that's close to the village people.
0:47
No!!
O
Bruno and Iroh; The best uncles ever known in the whole Cartoon universe
I say...yea your right Bruno is sopost to be gold medalist. Wait! We dont talk about Bruno. Right?
Camilo👏needs👏to👏be👏higher👏on👏the👏list👏
Pepa has a lot in Common with Elsa
The moral of Encanto reminds me of a similar one I've found in Big City Greens, another Disney property.  You should try and be successful...but you don't HAVE to or NEED to be a success for your family and friends to love you
I can most defenitly say that Abuela is the antagonist, she's pretty selfish and rude to her grandaughter. She was content with forgetting about her freaking son, simply because he would ruin the family status in the community. She cares about the magic her family has more instead've the family itself.
I keep getting distracted by you saying "Madrial" instead of "Madrigal". It makes me chuckle each time 😂
Ok but like in luca they say silensio Bruno soooo
Bruno was definitely most heroic because he was willing to give up his gift, family, and sanity for Maribel.
Also if you look at the end if the song don't talk about bruno you will see she was the reason why she all of the gift are going away...
Personally, I adored Isabella's development she is my least favorite other than her grandmother. As the eldest sister, she should have been an example and protective of Mirabel. Besides, the fact she gets angry at her sister for ruining her clearly the fake relationship with Mariano is just unfair.  As an older sister, I may not be great I still care for my younger brothers regardless of their flaws.
I disagree with the 1th place. *Casita is the best character. Period.* She is not just a literal feeling creature but also a creature made out of love and created to be a safe place for everyone. Spoilers:  When everyone was in danger even if was because of her, she (I am using her pronouns cause Casita is a female "name") still manage to take everyone to safety and help Mirabel to try get the candle.
I loved it but I think the grandfather and mirabelle should be switched
I totally agree
Camilo es mi hermano!!!!!!!!!!
Request Patrick Setiz roles from good to evil
What about the Mirabel’s home: the casita? Where would it be on the list. I think it is really supportive of Mirabel and stops the cousin of the family from getting extra food. It did cause the family harm by collapsing but it protected Mirabel as its sacrifice. Also, I am not counting the collapse against the house because it was the rift in the family that caused the collapse. The house’s sacrifice made the family bond and help one another. I would say that the house would be in the top 4 of the character list. The house has been helpful to the family no matter their differences.
In my opinion the uncle should be higher on the list than the parents and Mirabel should be below Antonio.
Honestly, Alma deserves to be at yhe bottom for her mistakes
You shouldn't put Isabelle at the end of the list! She's rude and stuck up bc Alma didn't let her make her own choices.
Diesny, s dinosaur  good to evil
i just realised this movie has a caracter named ''alma'' even tho my name is also alma- XD
There were no antagonist villains in this movie.
I totally agree that bruno must be at the top, he only wants to help by telling things he saw from the future, it's not his fault if a someone's future is going to be tragic. People only wants to hear what they want, but not the truth
why aren’t you pronouncing the ‘g’ in Madrigal
Cmon put Camilo on the top bro he is the best singer and character
I hate the abuela
Louisa is so😍 literally no Disney girl as good as her and you can’t change my mind
I love Bruno
Bruno’s dudes he pretends are different are just funny. “I AM (doesn’t remember name) AND I’M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING”
What about Godzilla 2014 and Godzilla King of the monsters good to evil
4:34 coco??
Do Shameless characters next! Good: Fiona, Liam, Debbie, Kevin and Veronica Neutral: Carl, Lip, Ian Bad: Mickey Evil: Frank
not good rating
I don't like the trend of getting rid of genuinely evil characters.  I appreciate that they do this to avoid causing offense but not everyone is misunderstood in real life.  Zira from the Lion King II is one of my favorites.  Zira sang, "Now the past I've tried forgetting, and my foes I could forgive.  Trouble is, I know it's petty, but I hate to let them live."    At least they should make the townspeople ungrateful and slowly start turning on the family once Luisa loses her gift and is unable to find their donkeys, right their houses, reroute rivers, and move churches.  I mean they turned on Bruno for predicting that one guy would get fat and another guy would get bald.
I alwlays
Totally agréé with your rank
You are so wright
I agree completely with this, except for one point: I would swap Pepa and Camilo. I know Camilo doesn’t play a huge role in the film, and it’s kinda only there as comedic relief, but the role Pepa plays feels more negative, as she’s the one re-enforcing the “We don’t talk about Bruno” conflict through out the film, not Alma. That mindset she has for him makes Dolores, and more so Camilo, afraid of their uncle (at least in my opinion) and it seems that Antonio has little to no knowledge of his uncle, outside of the fact that he has an uncle, given that he’s never seen addressing anything about Bruno until he meets him, with the rats as alibi. So, I would swap Pepa and Camilo Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
Loved the movie but their last name is MADRIGAL NOT MADRIAL
Loved the movie but their last name is MADRIGAL NOT MADRIAL
Bruno gives me neglected middle child energy and I feel for him for that very reason.
I think this movie is best for any upcoming series in disney plus
Mirabel is now one of my most favorite Disney characters of all time
my mom wanted to watch this movie i also wanted her to see and know the lesson to learn in this .That not all of her children were perfect some of use has flows some were trying to be the golden child .
Bruno is hot 😋😋
MadriGal*
Thers a bad Carter which is the 3 headed dog.
Ya
The pronunciation of the names😩😭
I watched the movie on monday. i loved and i loved every character i cant decide on a favorite. but if i had to it would either be peppa,dolores or luisa.  i loved how luisa really opened up to mirable and i loved how dolores heard bruno and only told mirable as she didn't want anything bad to happen to bruno and i loved peppa because of her emotional personality just like me. me and peppa have a lot in common.
8:10
Wait I just thought of something what if Mirabel‘s gift is loving her family because she already had colored clothes when she was little (if I am wrong it’s because I never saw the movie)
Do most weakest to most powerful
Camilo loves his family with all his heart, helps others, is friendly, but yes, he likes to joke, such is his character. I like. No one is perfect, everyone has their own zest)
But we need a second part to know the rest of the family, everything was so funny
What about bru- shhh we don’t talk about Bruno
I felt so bad for Bruno and mirabel. Bruno can’t help what he saw…. Mirabel was shunned for not having a gift… alma knew what was going on with the house and chose to hide it….
Lll,”:, i
I think I know why they hate bruno so much. In the song we don't talk about bruno they said "once your prophecy is read no going back!" So I think bruno can choose what to see or not but once he sees it its final but it's always mostly bad
It was a great video!! Just one thing, I'm from Colombia and I have to clarify that people who killed Pedro weren't conquerors (I wish it's written well). Here there are millions of people that were forced to leave there home because of violence. It's called forced displacement (desplazamiento forzado, in Spanish). It's with a lot of respect, I loved the video and the ranking!! ☺️
Which one is the evil potato Bruno
So why excactly the house destroyed? im confused at this part
Enchanto *
This movie went by so quick it reminded me to a short before an actual movie, I enjoyed it but still
I really enjoyed this movie hey you know what I realize is that maybe Maribel didn’t get powers is because it was three sisters I think the way the gift comes if it’s three children it has to either be two boys and a girl or two girls and a boy since Maribel is the baby and the third girl the gift skipped her but it didn’t skip anyone else because her cousins are two boys and one girl
I really feel like disney dosent like bruno cuz  first it was “selenceo bruno” now its “ we dont talk about bruno”
Omg 😱
Now a Evil to Most evil.....oh wait you can’t.
ANOTHER Disney movie without a villain
Off subject but Does anyone else the 'still pictures' move or am i way to stressed
Tf is this video? Why do I feel like this is a content farm
What Bruno pissed off Disney?
Hey you forgot the best character in the movie casita
So, does anyone else wonder how Pepa had her kids? Like did she just have her kids in a torndado or did they have to sedate her when the time came?
The Rising of the Shield Hero characters good to evil
Lots of South American animations lately
"conquistadors" 😂
Could you try to pronounce the names correctly? I was trying to let it go until you got to Julieta. The J should be pronounced like an H.
But what about Casita? the house was as much a character as anyone else! I’d even argue it was the true gold medal of good as even as it was dying it moved to protect everybody when it could
I Find it funny cause the moral is that no one can be flawless but since there are no bad charecters the 0 means good but most FLAWS
Best rating ever!!
I love Pepe and Felix, really I love they and their children! They are all different but balance each other out
Luisa is probably a Pisces
I think maribel is an Aquarius
This movie was hard to watch threw the crying lol 😂
Can't wait to see CinemaWins do this movie. Should be a blast.
I'm gonna buy this film as soon as it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray and Digital. Looks fantastic.

I just noticed that Bruno is the one who looks the most like the late grandfather, with Mirabel being close behind. The fact that he so willingly sacrificed himself for his family's wellbeing perfectly mirrors his father too. Man just when I thought this couldn't get any sadder.
I feel like Isabella isn’t a flower grower, but a plant grower
no no  no  no no no
Remember: She was disowned for not having any talents. Like Harry Potter, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, etc.

The Rise and Fall of CCP Officials Besides serving as the Central 610 Office chief (since 2015) and Minister of Justice (2018 – 2020), Fu had also severed other key positions, especially in the police system. They include Director of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau (2010 – 2013) and Executive Deputy Minister of Public Security (2013 – 2018). Because of his heavy involvement in the persecution of Falun Gong, he was one of the officials reported by Falun Gong practitioners to 29 countries.   Matas said that Fu is known to have directed the suppression of Falun Gong. In China, those “disciplinary” measures are often tied to corruption charges. But in China, “they [these measures] tend to be levied for political reasons against people who are on the political levels. It's just a way of the party manipulating control,” he explained, adding “the use of corruption by the disciplinary committee is basically just a political tool for manipulation in the power struggle.”  The investigation of Fu and other officials does not necessarily indicate the persecution of Falun Gong would stop, Matas continued. “Many of them [the officials] have used the persecution of Falun Gong as a device for escalating their status in the party, including Bo Xilai, including Zhou Yongkang,” he added, “That doesn’t mean that the people who are against them are opposed to the device they’ve used.”
Disney way to woke!
Disney is Santanic, WHY else would they have 666 in their Logo !?
The world doesn't deserve Bruno, but Bruno deserves the world
I saw the movie!  It was an interesting theme as well as Colombian culture.
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️  🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂 💩💩💩💩💩
i think that isabella deservs to be like 4th or5th becase she alwasys did what was best for the family and just did what her grandma did cuz she thot she was perfect
Most good? is that proper grammar?
I'm not from where they are soooooo....pass.
I really liked Isabella but only because I kind of connected with her
Okay, am I the only one who has a very gay crush on Camilo? 💀😭🥺🤧
Brillaint list! Only catch is it wasn’t  Conquistadors that killed Pedro, it was likely he got killed during Simon Bolívar’s war to liberate New Granada (later Colombia) as part of the Venezuelan War of Independence between 1810-1823. Reason for this is that the Conquistadors operated through the 16th, 17th and 18th Century. Colombia as a nation with the yellow, blue and red flag depicted in the move didn’t exist until 1863ish in the 19th Century.
This actually is a good to worst list! Who else sees that?
I like to think that even if someone has a different favourite character, every Tv show and Movie has a definitive ‘best’ character, and Bruno is definitely that. You can love Luisa and Isabella and Camilo, but I feel like Bruno will ultimately be the ‘best’ character regardless
ATENTION: CASITA TO BE IN THIS LIST
Correction bruno is the grandfather
Me looking at mariano: Is that you, guy from rapunzel? Also tell me if i spelled mariano wrong, and tell me what the guy from rapunzels name is.

Nah Isabela is a bitch- she is justified tho, but she is a 22 year old women who should know when things aren’t going well for her or when she is at her limit. She doesn’t need to take it on someone else.  I would completely understand that type of behavior from someone like Camilo (Thank God he is a good kid in the final product, but if he wasn’t he could’ve been very mean to Mirabel since he shares the same age as her, he is just older by weeks or months) because he could’ve probably saw her as his “equal” but since she didn’t got a gift she is not an “equal” anymore.  A thing that is true, siblings fight, but siblings do NOT make each other feel bad about themselves or make the other think they aren’t worth of love and appreciation. That’s what Isabela does. Isabela literally tells Mirabel to stop trying so hard because she is in the way…excuse me bitch? Don’t you remember your sister is traumatized for life since little when she knew she would never be gifted like you??? Don’t you remember all the tears she probably shed thinking on how she can’t be your sister or Luisa’s because she is normal??? You think you have pressure for being the “older role model sibling” for the family and village when Mirabel felt and was treated like she was the DISAPPOINTMENT of the family/village??? And I repeat- SHE IS A 22 YEAR OLD- A FUCKING ADULT- she behaves like this mean girl 14 year old popular girl in highschool-
Do arcane pls
LOL CONQUISTADOR, dude they were guerrillas its colombia no the viceroyalty of new granada
BRUNO IS THE CUTEST BABY I LOVE HIM
Anyone else felt Camino was just darling whilst soothing his mother’s nerves?   All the characters are awesome.
conquistadors, rlly? r u like, stupid?
Dude you didn't even try to pronounce "Madrigal" properly...
Don’t spoil the movie man, it’s just released
Out of all violent people un Colombia, I don't think conquistadors are the ones portrayed in the movie. I think they are meant to be the violent people in general in modern colombia (second half of past century), without pointing to any specific side of the conflict.
I haven't even seen the movie and already I'm seeing all these characters.
This is an excellent movie to watch
I'm so happy that Colombia got a movie! I honestly thought that Brazil would get one first, our maybe Ecuador, but they did a perfect job with the songs and character design, I'm so happy my country has been recognized :)
I have to admit that this movie made me cry too much. I have never related to a Disney protagonist.   It legit triggered a memory that I have of my grandma and hence my strong dislike towards the grandma in the movie 😅  My grandma legit asked me and my sister to tell her more about ourselves and plans to brag to our extended family back in Mexico, as if just going to college wasn't good enough compared to our cousins that start music in highschool or go to the military or work straight away.  But I get it. Like my dad who puts *slight* pressure on us to get *a bit* further in life than him in this second opportunity in the US.
Encanto is definitely my new favorite Disney animated movie next to Raya and The Last Dragon. The characters, the animation, the colors, the soundtrack- Oh God, THE SOUNDTRACK!

I know that this isn’t technically considered a character, but I consider the casita a character (house)
We’re did you find the movie please tell me
Bruno was my favorite! Also i’m surprised you made one for this movie this early I think Julieta and Agustin should’ve been a bit higher on the list since they’re pretty pure.
MADRIAL?! MADRIAL?! EVERYONE KNOWS THIS IM NOT SPANISH BUT ITS MADRIGàL PèNDèJo
Great analysis. I agree with everything. Except 1 thing: the grandparents were not running away from “conquistadors”; the movie is set between 1900-1950’s and Colombia’s independence from Spain was on 1810. They were running from the “violence “ a violent time when civil wars were rampant in Colombia 🇨🇴; and it’s a reflection of still current “desplazados”: Colombia 🇨🇴 sadly is the country with most inner displacement of communities in the world; mostly because of the war between leftist and right wing fascist governments until today 2021.
I advice you cover  my little pony new generation it’s a good movie tho
Those weren't conquistadors those were other Colombian people as its set during the Colombian civil war, which worse part was during the the last of the 19th century till early 20th, after a wile it toneded down in some parts, to be fair it hastnt ended completely, the difference is where and who is fainting, always having inocente people as victims of their war.
I would rank Camilo above pepa not because he's my favorite, but because his mom is a little self-centered
👌
The clan with special powers saving their town and home from danger.💖
Can you please do modern Disney villains good to evil? Try happy feet good to evil. Cap you please update Pixar villains good to evil and hero’s good to most good?
I love Bruno he needs a lot of therapy and so do I
The movie made no sense. This legit felt like Eternals lol
With Isabela they are sisters sisters don’t like each other
❤️ *Es una película dedicada al creador de por su hermosa Creación.* Vida,valores,virtudes,principios y la gracia de Dios en cada elemento natural. *El poder de Mirabel  es su calidad humana,rica en espiritualidad*
If I learnt anything from the film its that I would kill for bruno
Who the fuck is paey-pah
I would’ve put Camilo below Isabella because he also tried to scare maribel during we don’t talk about Bruno by making him seem like a monster
You got a new inch well due to the original one was that devil woman being a little bit offensive
Antonio and Dolores are my favorite characters
Hey, may I say an objection?   I would like to say that Isabella is better than second to last, because she has a great personality change. She stopped being so aarogant after Mirabel approached her, and though she is at first rude, she changes greatly. Personally, just from the story, I think her experiences make her more valuable than just least good. Things come to terms with Mirabel and her, so I'd put her at.. 3rd place good? Above Camilo, or Pepa. Not saying your list is bad, I just wanted to say my opinion But I agree with your list otherwise :) great job!
God I love this movie!

Great video i might watch this
Can you do inside out least good to most good?
I definitely would have put Isabela a little higher on the list, at least above Pepa. Good list overall, and it's always amazing how fast these come out after new movies!
I thought the house would be on the list since he is kinda a character, or is it because the house and grandpa are the same since when he passed the candle got the power and the house was formed
What the hell is Encanto?
The world doesn't deserve Bruno, but Bruno deserves the world
im not sure why Mariano is here, hes just a (kind of) fiance, but other than that... yeah! I agreed

Madrigal family wasn't being followed by conquistadores. They were followed by the guerrilla members called chulavitas that were a huge problem in Colombia's XIX century and XX century. That period of time was called La Violencia and Disney portrays it really good.
CN you do nativity for Christmas
I can’t believe am saying this up my bro is in love with Isabela lol
I’m glad Bruno got ranked high
I would put mirabel at the top
You forgot the house it had feelings too
I would put Antonio above Luisa, but otherwise, this is accurate
Ducktales reboot characters: good to evil.
I'd love a good to evil for "The Great Mouse Detective" and "Robin Hood".
i really enjoyed every character in this movie, specially isabela. her personal growth is very notable and well done, and  i wish we could have seen more of her with this newly found independence of the "always perfect" mindset, like maybe her redecorating her room and making herself over.
I wonder if Camilla is bisexual like Loki considering their shape shifting.
Just a note: Pedro and Alma weren't fleeing from conquistadores but from civil war violence.

I do understand why Alma is at the bottom is Isabella should be higher than where she is placed in this video because she had all that pressure on her shoulders from Alma she always felt like she needed to be perfect because she is 1 is the oldest out of the 3 sisters & has to be responsible & I get why Luisa is higher than her but because Isabella is getting older she needs to make a plan for herself what she is going to do in the future & all of that. She is scared of disappointment from her family & most of all her grandmother because in the song at the end when Alma says "what's going on?" I'm sure she was scared to tell (idk because I didn't see the movie yet) I can relate due to me being older than my brother I am the older one & sometimes I feel like I have pressure to be perfect due to me being older sometimes you feel like you have to please everyone & that is how Isabella feels I do understand she has her flaws but that's what she is trying to hide and not show because the less she shows her flaws the more pressure she will put on herself (I know this is really long so sorry about that & I understand that you have your won reason to put her right before Alma but I'm just putting my reason there so no hate please & thank you)
