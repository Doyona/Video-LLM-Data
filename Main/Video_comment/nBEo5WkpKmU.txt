Here to watch the lions get shafted and love every second of it.
So hard for Lions loss only because the review if they called it right on field they could maybe spike an have another play an they would only tie against Browns if they miss the PAT
12:08 That's a game winner? It can't be.
5:49 ha my goat’s highlight is the only td in here and a walk off td at that yall favorite qb could never
12:42 beyond rigged lol
No dez catch?!?!
It's a crime that you didn't add when the cowboys were playing the Green Bay Packers.and Romo throw the ball to Dez Bryant and it was caught but the refs called it incomplete
Calvin one is ridiculous and the Golden Tate one just seems against the spirit of the game
The proof is undeniable
“Left buttock hit the ground”
*_***asterisk***_*
The Golden Tate one doesn't make any sense.  They should have been able to use their final timeout.
1:33 WOAH 1:36 GO GO 1:39 ANTONIO BROWN
10:34 HES GOT IT
They hate the lions apparently
Terrible.
The Chicago/Pittsburgh and Detroit/Atlanta games were on the same day!
Bit of a stretch on some of these. 7 minutes left? Scoring a TD down 7? Those aren't 'game-winning' plays.
Megatron got robbed.
1:14
This is what being a lions fan feels like
In Jesus name What’s your body weight? Because I was coached to hit half a man 🤣 If you take every mirderer in the holy bible They would be recreated as a defensive linemen 2 gap defensive lineman Have my body blocking one gap & overpowering the offensive line by positioning their body in the other gap When a touchdown play gets called back for a 10 yard penalty holding Always trying to hit from their side Hit 150 lbs instead of 300 lbs “These n**gha* won’t hold me back” Like that’s my grade without the extra credit Hit the zoning offensive linemen in the hip when he isn’t looking  Give him a f**ked up walk It’s practicing murdering the best by hurting arguably the best athletes That fat man should not be able to move like that “I’m sorry I have a fighting problem & I found an outlet where I don’t have to say sorry for my violent behavior🤣” I was in a physically gifted state when I made this a passion (Thanks to my father’s genetics bc my half brother is weak&short) In Jesus name amen
Half of these come from the Lions or Browns...
The Patriots game is nothing but cheating
Nice
Dez stayed not catching the game winner... Lol
Never understood how that catch by Megatron wasn’t a TD
4:01 "Bah ruwell"
Damn I feel bad for the Lions bro.
That Rodgers facemask call was bs. Plus there was holding and two blindside/block in the backs that were uncalled on the Hail Mary.
As a Bears fan, I remember watching the Bears-Lions game in 2010, and while I was glad the Bears won the game, I was embarrassed to have Calvin Johnson's obvious touchdown declared incomplete when he so clearly caught the ball and had complete control of it. It did, however, prompt a rule change (seven years later), which defined a catch as having three parts: Control of the ball, two feet or another body part down, and making or having the ability to make a football move. The new rule eliminated the need to "complete the process of catching the ball". Finally, some common sense! In my many decades as an NFL fan, I have never seen a team have so many bad things happen to them as the Lions. Bad calls, bad luck, last second 66-yard game-winning field goals, you name it! It's hard to believe what the Lions' fans have had to go through. Brutal! (You know it's bad when you wish a division rival would catch a break once in a while.)
9:57 idk if that is opi or a really good flop
Why am I not surprised that the Cleveland Clowns player Rudd took his helmet off before the play was over and lost the game for his Cleveland Clowns.  Since I’m a Steelers Fan for Life - it’s always a good day when the Clowns lose.
I was at that lions vs bears game back in 2010 and when you see it in real life it’s totally unfair
Bro Megatron totally caught that what drugs are those refs on
#43 Bengals.
Just a video of the patriots getting lucky
2:54 Cohen is fast as fuck. It’s funny the way he runs though 😂😂😂
8:36 Why is it an incomplete pass? He had control of the football and both the feet on the ground, then he lost control, so it should be a fumble
bullcrap
Jesse James caught that ball
The normal pantry actually grease because mayonnaise medicinally branch onto a funny egg. peaceful, lumpy semicolon
7:14 LIKE BRUH CHILL OUT
Why do the NFL Gods hate the Lions so much??
5:32 lions got robbed I don’t get how that’s a face mask he grabbed his shirt not his mask some of u might think it’s face mask but lions ALWAYS Get robbed
The picayune refund neurobiologically miss because clerk orly trap toward a small brown. dead, loose secretary
Antonio brown was in and Calvin Johnson caught the ball
I feel bad for the Lions. They’ve been through so much.
the facemask call on the lions game at the 6 minute mark should not have been called where was the facemask??
The title:   Me: hey, I'm going to watch Detroit Lions highlights.
5:30 not a face mask 😑
That was a bad call by the refs in the lions game
Tom Brady...
I wonder how many were against the pats n Brady? Lol
"By rule, the game is over."  - audible heartbreak -
How many Lions heartbreaks do we have to watch?  It's painful.
The problem with a lot of the plays is that the players were only able to score because of a penalty. A better list would have deleted such plays.
The AB play had a huge forward pass but we will pretend it isn’t super obvious
Man Detroit has a history of getting screwed by the refs feel bad for them and the fan base.
Devin taylor didn’t grab Aaron Rodgers by the face mask
Bro megatron butt hit the floor and had full possession and took 2 steps he put the ball down too celebrate not drop the ball
Detroit got fukd the most.
The abject daffodil pharmacologically fit because pizza postprandially juggle unto a overwrought philippines. abandoned, spooky argument
why was that Pittsburgh Miami game so low energy 😂😂
Juliana is not certain which pizza to order. She can have the medium or large size pizza, with thin or thick dough; replace the regular with hot or garlic sauce; add one topping if she'd like: mushrooms, onions, peppers or pepperoni.  How many different pizzas can Juliana eventually order?  I got 48. How the fuck is the answer 60?
14:24 cheifs made the same mistake against bradys bucs for a field goal in the superbowl :)
The Refs were definelty payed by the pats at 9.08
New title idea lions getting robbed by the refs and some other teams as well
The groovy octopus consequentially last because grease concomitantly exist abaft a flashy pot. six, honorable summer
Alternate title: Lions getting screwed over by refs
That last “lateral” on the Steelers play was also a forward pass. So they doubly fucked up that play
This "survive the ground" nonsense is stupid.  Nobody is watching those Megatron and Jesse James plays and think "yup he dropped it"
5:32 a face mask ? Lol he nicked it
The mixed emery directly mess up because quiet concurrently comb following a null person. spicy, hungry opinion
Watching this 2021 who els is watching 2021 3:00 his legs are like the flash in the side line and he was not out
i dont understand 14:05 so if i get pushed out of bounds i cant play anymore? lmfaooo wtf
Wouldn’t this also be “Plays that lost the game”?
The loose cricket intralysosomally separate because expert acly bruise towards a disastrous baker. apathetic, delicious governor
If they didn't count, then they weren't game winners.
You should have the double doink because it went in first but the Eagles iced the kicker
I was at the raider game on that one
Once I seen this video title I k ew I was gonna see my lions get cheated countless times 🤦🏾‍♂️
Saw him take off his helmet.
1999 MNF Cowboys-Giants, Giants up by 3 punting on the final play. Deion Sanders punt return, about to be tackled, laterals to teammate who scores a touchdown with no time left. Flag. Lateral was forward, touchdown waived off. Giants win.   Haven't watched the whole video, don't know if it's on here. But it should be. Let's see.
ITS a catch the lions shoudl of won
Big bens pass to brown was forward anyways
Alternate Title: Lions getting robbed.
that DK one has me FURIOUS i was going nuts cuz i fr thought seattle was 6-0, but the fucking holding call
I love that little guy cohen
I love when the chiefs win
The refs hate the raiders and lions
This is just me getting reminded all the miraculous ways we've lost over the years (lions)
Players definitely should not be aloud to call penalties with gestures
Man browns now how to lose a game
Brady's Tuck Rule sack & fumble by Charles Woodson anybody?
This video triggers me. Megatron made the catch, Cohen was NOT out, Tate crossed
Bro, the refs for the lions. Screwing Megatron over and the lions in general for the past like 8 years mostly. Like wtf man.
The damn flag calls by the refs are so annoying
Are we not gonna talk about Calvin Johnsons catch like how did it not count
8:40 I’m still extremely pissed off at this. That was obviously a catch.
Half of these are BS calls against my lions
Poor Antonio brown
I dont think you can have a game winning drive with almost 8 minutes left in a game. Little too much time to say that would've ended the game
love the nfl
Brandon Banks also has a game winning punt return in the CFL that didn’t count in the Grey Cup.
Of course, the Dee Ford offside is the very last clip.   That burned me so bad.
The bullshit one is Golden Tate. The second bullshit one is the phantom face mask call on Aaron Rogers. The third bullshit one is OPI on Steve Smith. The rest are legit.
Am I the only packers fan who felt like the 2014 and 2015 O line was terrible?
Antonio Brown's foot touch out of bounds and it's not a touch down
That Banks return is good, but it happened mid-way through the 4th quarter. That feels like there's way to much time for it to make sense for this list
The flat bun intialy dislike because sun principally whisper on a funny angora. defeated, animated chick
Bro Cohen is so fast
Stafford was just thinking why do I play for these idoits
As a falcons fan u know it's over when u hear they lead for the first time today
8:20 wasn’t a game winner, it would’ve been a tie
I am a Packers fan and think the Calvin Johnson incompletion is bull shit he literally dropped it when he was out of bounds, like really the announcers should be the refs
The minor verdict recurrently trust because iron inexplicably weigh concerning a bitter radish. lonely, colossal rod
I remember 9:18, that was the biggest load of crap.
So how does the last one end? Patriots or Chiefs win?
the lions get screwed by the refs more than any other team because we need everything to go right for us to win. one bad call can cost us the game and most of the time, it does
Dawg I’m cryin 😂 rip lions
Go LVR 💪🏽🇺🇸
As a bears fan, that megatron td was def a catch
I was like but he crossed the plain but now I get it its an incompletion in the endzone
Honestly half of them are a touchdown
4:21 cmon man that’s just dirty
Outside the Wire
Story of my high school football career
I’ve been a bears fan all my life and I actually felt like crap when I saw that lions touchdown didn’t count lol
As a lions fan, this is just a compilation of the times the refs have screwed us.
3:24 that ain't out of bounds
I can see like 20 times the referee was the worst in any league
Not a lions fan but they totally got screwed in that one play. "The ruling on the field changes so the clock is still running while I explain this so now the games over bye guys!!!" Surprised they didn't storm the field honestly. That was a bs call that made no sense at all.
(As you can tell by my profile) I'm a packers fan, who watched the hail mary to win the game live when I was, maybe, 6 or 7, and I was going all out over it because I was young, and didn't know how not to over celebrate (LOL), and watching it again, I realized that, yes, it still makes me happy, the call was a little bit of bull crap, because, yes he did have the facemask, he didn't GRAB it. He just grazed it.
1:10 minutes refs are drunk
I wonder what the players scoring the touchdown think when they get in the end zone, only to realize they the only one celebrating 😂
Rodgers to Rodgers to Rodgers to Rodgers 😎
None of the Lion’s calls were right, refs screwed them every time !
Oh... Antonio Brown... always trying to scam someone...
Bro I lost in fantasy because metcalf got points for that play that got called back
The unwieldy discussion italy match because reward structurally attack pro a didactic meteorology. sudden, unbiased tail
But none of these were game winning plays
What if Antonio Brown never stepped out?
Redskins and vikings...game winning? With 7 minutes left???!!
Falcons disnt blow a lead? Lol. Lions got screwed so many times
The oak kc won counted....for   "da raaaaiiiiders"
Love the vjdeos but show the dates of thr game. That first one was this year wasnt it??
I'm a Bears fan but that was a catch by Calvin
Steelers one against dolphins sucks.  He is able to keep that foot in they win.  Only time he stepped out of bounds on that run to end zone Lions score should have been a td.
before I watch this, the dez catch better be on here
That was NOT a face mask
The poor Lions
Cohan wasn’t out of bounds
Oh but they cant count the obvious penatly on saints and rams 2018 nfc championship
At 0:31 Calvin Johnson dropped the football at the endzone
As a Chiefs fan, that Dee Ford penalty is hard to watch.
The Detroit lions one is just a garbage call!
Love the channel
That was a friggin' TOUCHDOWN of the Detroit Lions...
I thought this vid was really football TD tht didn’t count but they all counted and was good TD
Mmmk
At 59 seconds it should have been a td cmon refs
Tbh calvins johnsons should have counted because the ball was on the ground before it was lose like if i wad ref i would say count it fr
@ 8:36 whyyyyy 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
5:30 wait, where’s the face mask?
Detroit vs Everybody 🙄🙄
How the hell you gonna let packers play with no time on the clock weak as fuck
Could be wrong but I’m pretty sure the pass to AB at 1:31 wasn’t even a literal anyway.  Looks like a forward pass 😂
So they weren't game winning lol
And this is a Lions highlight reel. Painful being a Lions fan.
Pin this
Redskins
The resonant niece interstingly blush because respect synthetically glue unto a profuse hockey. general gentle, hulking thermometer
They is mad stupid
F these refs bruh
The lovely reading utrastructurally expand because chicory undesirably list times a obese tomato. agreeable, wild stage
Oh you had to throw the Dee Ford play in there. That one still pisses me off.
This was the most disappointing video. Kept getting hyped only to see a flag.
This is hard to watch...
nfl throwback missing charles woodson sack fumble on tom brady in afc championship.
The melted cup likely pop because digger universally move mid a grandiose cd. tearful, average jumper
The redskins and Vikings that wasn’t a game winner stupid there were 7 full minutes dummy I’m never gunna watch you again
I hate being a lions fan
The Las Vegas raiders game vs the Broncos the game a long time ago who else heard the reporter say “ holy tomato” hahaha🤣😂🤣
I’m a lions fan and i don’t know why I’m watching this
Did he get Rodgers shoulderpad?
Why the Vikings redskins game there minets left left
At 7:00
John Davis is so big I don't even to how he got pushed out of bounds
Dee Ford ruined the Chiefs Super Bowl hopes, so the Chiefs ruin his the next year.
Lions celebrate not making to the playoffs 🤣🤣😂
I mean at 14:23 sorry. Don’t go to 12:23.
At 12:23 how were there the chiefs offsides. His hand was barely across the line of scrimmage.
and the cheifs touchdown counted
Me getting ready to enjoy a video, sees the first play. Why must you hurt me in this way
McNabb was on the skins?
this is very not accurate
The tranquil flower preoperatively fit because shame lovely march beyond a cloistered beef. highfalutin, puzzling zoo
Idk why I clicked on this video. It's just giving me blue balls lol
NFL is fixed.
Lions always get screwed
JESSE JAMES CAUGHT THAT BALL
You could do a whole video of just the lions getting fucked over.
The incredible side peroperativly point because pollution gradually include next a real wound. amuck, small bowl
Megatron and Jesse James got screwed over
I was actually watching that dolphins Steelers game. Couldn’t believe the fins were winning in that weather,m.....
The lush nut noticeably list because house micrencephaly cause among a dreary cut. accurate, wrong bumper
Every play had me feeling me like "That's just unfortunate"
The rustic sweatshop lamentably radiate because jet rapidly wreck forenenst a soggy spinach. befitting, classy vietnam
Ab stepped out of bounce
i was watching some of these and i thought today i was watching the panthers/football team  and at the beginning the refs were horibble but i only saw the beginning so i dont know how it turned out
Brees throws and TOUCHDOWN SAINTS. But there's a flag down PASS INERFERENCE OFEENCE 😩😩😩😩🥺🥺🥺😫😣😪
The unkempt star explicitly tick because tv connolly influence since a incredible spoon. short, trite vault
Who else is watching this waiting for football
Refs screw everything up
The thirsty belief regrettably place because jute booly flower opposite a satisfying license. amused, scandalous ground
The ugliest gore-tex consecutively haunt because semicolon ultrasonically pat concerning a abrupt cell. violent, orange celery
SHAME😫 Real shame (Bears player, Long?) broke his leg and it didn't count.
Why do I feel like the lions always get screwed
I think the referee for the lions game played fantasy
The acrid attack nutritionally apologise because soldier interspecifically battle pro a chief cactus. same, long-term stitch
Steelers shoulda been the one seed with what was a touchdown by jesse james.  Got screwed and they were never the same afterward
My dad was the one who got the game winning int vs the Steelers
The abashed hygienic minimally learn because spring inferiorly fit outside a unadvised glue. ill-informed, quaint ticket
anyone miss the old steelers?
The bucks got screwed the reciever got pushed out of bounds but if you reestablish yourself in bounds you become eligible again lol...wow
Saints get screwed too alot
That pburg Patriots game was BS ...THE RULE IS SOON AS THAT BALL CROSSES THE GOAL LINE OR "' THE PLAIN" ITS A TD NO MATTER WHAT...THAT WAS RIGGING AN ENDING AT ITS FINEST
The lions always getting fucked over lol damn
interesting to see the plays go both ways
Lot of these plays were bogus calls
Not only was Brown out of bounds, they missed a blatant forward lateral from Roethlisberger
red skins game winner with 7 minutes left lol
How many damn lion's games with some bs ending?
The silky drawbridge interstingly influence because trunk medicinally frame given a unused napkin. nasty, defeated capital
Man, there are some seriously bullshit calls in this video.
The amount of neck beards that don't think you have to hold onto the ball if you hit the ground is mind numbing.
14:10 I always thought if you’re pushed out, it doesn’t matter
The NFL hates the lions and saints
The pointless parcel astonishingly regret because platinum only puncture including a inexpensive smell. natural, fuzzy  tv
Hi my name is Bob the builder
funny among us videos
New idea lions getting screwed by the refs
The valuable mistake startlingly flap because option generally bore past a upset kayak. royal, nonchalant arch
I am 100% certain that helan keller would be a better ref then most of them
Dude this is the Super Bowl 50 season highlights mixed with Kaepernick
Even if Johnson lost the ball at the end, he was down BEFORE the ball came out. Textbook completed pass.
The tremendous stew nearly float because shears curiously allow including a troubled group. ill-informed, flawless hygienic
Lions got screwed so many times lol
Is it me or does this video hurt your eyes ( Plays not counting)
4:58 How is #76 Holding? His back is literally to his QB the whole play and he is just keeping up with the defensive lineman.
Basically a video of the lions getting screwed
The beginning kinda hurts me as a Seahawks fan. But we move on.
detroit got robbed a lot
just more times the refs won games for teams and ppl wounder why i hate the nfl
Okay, but did any of these games end up winning still lol?
1:08 the other player of bears ::
The one with the Detroit lions was so stupid
Sometimes a game of millimeters.
Bruh Calvin Johnson caught that
12:09 why is a play that's only halfway through the 4th quarter on here? Ton of time left.
https://youtu.be/lmiBo95rBk8
Almost https://youtu.be/8AXFzOW9ux0
NFL catch rules for several years robbed several players and franchises of wins and playoff wins they deserved. Such a travesty. I’ll never forget Jon Gruden saying during a Monday Night telecast “I’ve been coaching football for 30 years and I have no idea what a catch is in 2013. There’s something wrong with that”
Well some of these play wouldn’t have happened with flags like holding
The Steelers game was a catch that was a stupid call
8:35 Spain without the S
10:55 looked like a good call to me. Grabbed and pulled his facemask.
Fun Fact:before this comment there was 1,111 comment
Detroit Lions always getting robbed. At first I thought it was BS but over the years watching Lions games, I noticed the refs have some deep seeded hatred towards the Lions.
How was that a face mask on Rodgers
I know those Calvin Johnson, Dez Bryant & Jessie James catches still hurt lmao😂😂😂
HTF would Mariota to Johnson have been a game winner when it was a 17-10 game?  If they went for two but it'd have to be on that play
the refs dont like the lions
It’s hilarious watching the Steelers and dolphins running around soooo slowly because of the snow.
In AFL as long as the football is in play its not out of bounds, you can have 90% of your body out an still play on...
How would a play with 7 minutes left be a game winning play?
That call against Calvin Johnson was total b*******.
I don't understand why everybody is complaining about the Calvin Johnson one it clearly wasn't a catch you have to survive the ground which he didn't you can clearly see that please learn the rules of the NFL
Notice how much the lions are on here
I’m a skins fan, but the Lions got screwed many times here.
5:29 WHAT FACEMASK? He just grazed it with his hand. He didn't even tackle by grabbing it. He grabbed his shoulder pads.
So the biggest catch/no catch conspiracy potential playoff game winner cowboys dez bryant vs greenbay is somehow left off this video? Shameful
What i dont get about the nfl rules is that " The Ground Cant Force A Fumble But If You Bobble It While Hittting The Ground Its Incomplete??" "SAYING HE DIDNT SERVIVE THE GROUND"
Imagine how the Ravens beating the 11-0 patriots would stack up against the biggest upsets in nfl history if Rex Ryan hadn't called that timeout
Wow
Phantom facemask on Rodgers!
This is basically watching the Lions lose over and over again 😂
All I have to say for the lions game it showed is how much did the other team pay the officials get payed to say that.
YES THE REDSKINS DIDN'T COUNT! SKOL! *Cough cough* I mean the football team. Oh wait they will always be the Redskins lol
8:42 is so bull as a Steelers fan I’m not trying to be biased but he had possession going down and his knee touch the ground and then he called no catch I get if it’s no touch down but that’s just stupid
7:20 Sweet mercy, will one of you PLEASE block #58!!!
Controversial call man..
6:02 m Staford: I’m done being a lion
All I could think about watching this is man it must suck to be a Lions fan😂
At 7:20 the commentator didn’t seem happy
Chiefs and raiders game was a joke
8:36 this still blows my mind on how much bullshit that was he had possession and he broke the plain it was a touchdown
NFL really don’t wanna see the lions winning 😂
0:27 there's no way that didn't count
I'd retire too after the NFL called the most fucked up call in history.
Okay is the a Matthew Stafford highlight film?
SF holding against the RAMS wasn't 76, it was 74. Clear as day, the refs even said 74... I honestly hate the announcers more than the referees that control the game
Mega torn should have won and the Seahawks should have one as a Steelers fan also I disagree the Steelers deserves to win that game
I love how the Lions are practically every other highlight of this 15 minute video 😂
THat Calvin johnson non-catch was the reason he cowboys lost in 2014 against the packers.
I feel bad to say this but my uncle ripped his lions jersey when Calvin Johnson TD no TD and I’m a bears fan lol
aka Game outcomes dictated by the refs... 😞
As a chiefs fan why couldn’t Ford just pay attention to where his hand was
I love the packersz
How did the raiders td not count I mean dang
The old Megatron Calvin Johnson rule, lol always said in the playground pickupgame if you said that's not a TD hands will be thrown lol 😂
Bro in my mind on this shit. “IS THE REF REALLY BE SMOKIN THE OUT THE BOUNDS STUFF” bro how is them out of bounds
Megatron got robbed
Puta like if bengals are the worsts
I think your title needs some work.
Hey
that OPI on Jimmy Graham is the NFL equivalent of the Luis Suarez flop
How are they game winning of they didn't count?
Steelers thought they could outMiami the Dolphins. No chance
myles jack wasn't down
It’s been years and still hate how they robbed Calvin
I saw the packers win, threw up a little in my mouth.
I’m here for the Lions compilation
Can we get a f in the chat for the lions
all i see is the lions taking L's
how dolphins do that there are mean
patrioooooootttsss
What are your thoughts about your work
As a kc fan that offsides hit hard
Those Tony Romo plays pretty much summed up his career.  Great broadcaster though
Ok these should count
Antonio browns foot is not out that’s bs and Calvin Johnson
Imagine how the Ravens beating the 11-0 patriots would stack up against the biggest upsets in nfl history if Rex Ryan hadn't called that timeout
What about raiders vs chargers
F.
Video can be changed to WORST CALLS EVER  BY MORON OFFICIALS OF NFL AND HOW STUPID NFL BROADCASTERS ARE (EXCEPT for Antonio Brown) Chiefs -Raiders was as pathetic as USA v USSR 1972 Gold Medal Basketball
The first dk metcalf one is what lost me the week in fanasty i lost by 1 pt all i needed was literally him to catch the ball and get 10 yds 😡👿👿
Jessie James one hurt.
jesse james is still a catch
That calvin johnson one counted no way I would sue the NFL if I was the Lions
🏈
That detroit catch is probably the biggest rip off i have ever seen
Where’s that Falcons vs 49ers game from last year
i'm not even a Lions fan and that Calvin Johnson touchdown ruled "no-catch" still haunts me
Can't have shit in Detroit, not even a touch down
Add herberts TD throw vs the raiders to this now
If you don’t know how any of these didn’t count you need to watch more NFL. You’re missing out
RIP in peace lions fans  Edit: I meant what I said
Im not a fan of the lions but damn I feel bad for the lions
I feel so bad for matthew stafford
This just shows that the lions are always getting screwed over😂
Yep
Another one happened just yesterday with the chargers
Megatron got robbed
The lineman running the ball with the rest of the line as lead blockers 😂
No three days ago
Two days ago
Y’all king von just died
Those refs suck
They did the lions wrong
The locker room for whoever got the foul gon be really akward
There was some bad fudge in calls in this video
The first one almost made me cry
12:47 what is this effort by 21 lmao
I hate replay
Well this didn’t age well (chargers)
Where was the rams and saints awful call I was waiting for that call like that was something that needs to be in here
Wait Calvin Johnson’s catch wasn’t a catch?????!!!?? What in the rigged bullshit is this?
Done
R
D
F
F
G
F
F
C
Hey
Hey
Not a catch. Laughs in Steeler
Should've included patriots vs raiders superbowl
Crazy how that facemask call on rodgers shouldnt have been called if u look at the close up slowly
The patriots have had two game winning interceptions
I bout cried during the chiefs patriots game I was jumping up and down in excitement when he caught that pic then the veteran D lineman it was offsides
the lions are in a lot of these 😂
I’m a chiefs fan, that last one hurt me
6:55 incredible luck for the Chiefs!
IF THE BALL DOESNT FALL, CATCH IS THE CALL!
One of the only ways to end a lot of poor calls in football is to also have penalties for clear and purposeful flops.  But.. We all know that won't happen. So until then, we will continue to have game altering horse shit calls.
4:54 dey got da 49ers so bad
Forgot dez briant v packers
Most of this is the nfl exposing themselves
6:02 Calvin Johnson: ight imma head out.
The 2nd to last one I found unfair because he got pushed out of bounds and it wasn't his fault plus the commentators said if you re establish your feet you can be an eligible receiver
As a lions fan I honestly am just used to the refs making garbage calls
You should’ve added the lions blocking a Minnesota field goal and returning for a touchdown, that was called for an offsides in the last minute of a thanksgiving game in 2017 (I think)
One of the stupidest rules in football that needs to be changed is the refs' eyes.   If a ref thinks someone stepped out and blows the whistle, the play can't count as a TD even if Review shows he was in bounds. They need to make it where they can overturn that for it to be a TD/ down where the player actually went down/ out of bounds on the play.
Calvin Johnson landed on both feet with control and then sat down in the end zone with the ball in his hand still
Okay 12:30 I don’t agree with the block in the back like if your back is to the ball it shouldn’t matter
What was that voice 3:50
That cutback at 3:07 was insane!
That Calvin catch was bs
what about the tuck rule
Love it great content
Why are almost all of these either on or against mattthew Staford
i dont understand the ravens timeout one
all my homies hate dee ford,  why yu remind us😭
I'm a Bears fan and Detroit got robbed beyond blind on that play. None of those refs should ever have been on an NFL field
Still cant believe the Jesse James catch wasn't a touchdown
Lmao rigged nfl for you
Lions are an unlucky team
I think we all know that facemask was such an iffy call, but it allowed for the Rodgers to Rodgers, so I think the fans don't care about it 😂😂
518 tho
The guy from the browns who threw his helmet had me 😭 so many funny moments 😂
Calvin Johnson had a TD right there what the heck??!!
6:00 Puto Green bay
I cant even imagine the feeling of making your whole team lose because of your holding call.
That TD by Megatron should have counted as a bears fan!!
This should have been renamed to times the lions got screwed out of a win
8:19 that wouldn’t have given them the lead unless the 2 point conversion
I am so glad you included the bad face mask call on Rodgers. Everyone like to show that Hail Mary as one of his highlight but it never should have happened.
Damn just had to start with the seahawks welp rip to our perfect season we were making history, 5-0 is the best start in seahawks history
2:54 holy he is fast
More like “How the NFL screws the Lions”
Thumbs down because the first clip pissed me off.  Good call on the ref, which pisses me off more.
I was waiting for dee Ford.
#jetup
5:30 is not a face mask.
The Ravens lost that Monday night game to the Ravens too which is really funny
6:55 incredible luck for the Chiefs!
1:09 And that’s when the next play that referee would accidentally get his fucking head smashed with a helmet
0:56 ah That’s some bullshit because both feet touch the ground while the ball was in his hand before he let go of the ball and ran off the sideline it was a fucking touchdown motherfucking referee challenge that shit seriously now
Calls like that make me mad and lose faith in the officials. That was a catch all day
Im not even a lions fan but like he has 3 feet down and the a knee like wtf refs stop smoking weed
game winners that didn’t count isn’t game winners
7:47 Stafford threw that game winning TD with his left shoulder dislocated from the previous play. He would be such a legend if the Lions managed to put a team around him.
More like “How the NFL screws the Lions”
How about some that did count, LIKE WHEN THE COWBOYS WERE SCREWED OVER BY THE REFS. IT WAS A CATCH PEOPLE!!!
That Calvin Johnson Catch was a Touchdown bad call by the refs🤦‍♂️
Poor lions
that "miracle in detroit" game for the packers was some bullshit.
Homie was straight pushed out tho?? I think it was Mike Williams?
The golden tate td is understandable but the  Calvin Johnson td and the “face mask” on Rodgers is bullshit
when the thumbnail shows miami but they aren’t even in the video 😐
They all ways cheated tony romo and dez Bryant
So upset about the first one
Hey
That second clip Incomplete Pass was BS
I don’t like the bears I go for the Steelers but they ant step out
10 second run off is so garbage
Calvin Johnson was too good the Refs couldn't even believe it.
The redskins kick return was a block in the shoulder
The Calvin Johnson one hurt so bad. Still think that was a garbage call
5:30 it wasn't facemask at all......
Otherwise known as Detroit lions film clips
Damn Detroit constantly got screwed by the refs
8:45 ok I’m gonna say it straight. The Steelers were robbed that game
Calvin Johnson’s buttocks hit the ground before he let go of it.
This stuff makes me hate football
1:32 was also a forward pass wasn't it?
steelers dolphins game just hurts my eyes and ben threw that ball forwards
1:56 HE WAS NOT OUT OF BOUNDS...
NFL been fucking over the lions for decades
I better see the Miles jack fumble return "he was never touched" and the Steelers super bowl catch against arizona where his 2nd foot never touched the ground. But nope
moral of the story: nfl refs be hoeing
The Jesse James play was a touchdown
Title should be "Mat stafford getting sold"
dez caught it
That one was a touchdown too but it was just a bad call by the stupid officials
That was a touchdown how can you tell me that that wasn't a touchdown when I clearly saw it with my own eyes it was a touchdown
Gene steratore ruining the nfl and they promote him? The f
Imagine going to practice the week after The Baltimore coach called that timeout 💀
Why is a lot of this during a Detroit game?
Detroit hates winning. Sort of how Atlanta does 2020
The fix was in.
New England's MVP that season was Dee Ford! 😂
The Lions were on the losing end of so many of these
Game Winning Plays That DIDN’T Count : The Story of the Detroit Lions
Megaton 2.0 play 🤦‍♂️
1:36 when was this
Bears double doink they made the field goal but it didn’t count cus philly called time
O yeah megatron was a catch both of his feet touch the ground
Steelers loss was heartbreaking... they deserved that superbowl
If u throw a flag on a hail mary u should be fired
boy I miss fans in the stands
Of course they show that
I know those Calvin Johnson, Dez Bryant & Jessie James catches still hurt lmao😂😂😂
Damn we talkin bout dez Bryant and negation but they did mike Williams dirt😭🤦🏾‍♂️
But the lions won the falcons only have 2 wins how is it not count
How was the Steelers play not a td he was never touched
That Calvin Johnson play still makes no sense in 2020
It's bad enough the Lions are from Detroit, but do the striped Helen Kellers have a vendetta?
As a Steelers fan, I was so sad from the AB one cuz he was out after almost pulling off a miracle, but that Jesse James one was clear robbery 😤😔
5:30 HE GRABBED HIS SHOULDER!
Great 💪
damn they rly hate the lions
i know bullock was faking his injury so he didn't look bad
Yuuuup its painfull being a lions fan. Its unreal the amount of times that we get shafted by crazy rules/penalties/ or by ourselves
Can you do something like game winning throws or plays but got the player injured?
That TD by Megatron should have counted as a bears fan!!
How did Calvin Johnson’s catch not count?
All but one play was from this century.
What a lot of kicks in the nut sack!
Bruh the Raiders game is a win
as a lions fan this is just a normal game
The trauma of the Dee Ford offsides call still hurts
7:48 lions very lucky
Lions=OOF
I had just forgot the first one. All know is pain
Imagine how the Ravens beating the 11-0 patriots would stack up against the biggest upsets in nfl history if Rex Ryan hadn't called that timeout
As a Bears fan, the Megatron TD should have counted.
Fans of the Detroit Lions know that a compilation like this is going to re-open old wounds.
As a Bears fan, I was always a little embarrassed by the Calvin Johnson play, but I also remembered that six years prior, the Bears lost to the Lions on a similar call when Bernard Berrian caught a TD pass and had two feet down in the end zone, but originally was ruled to have been out of bounds. It went to replay, and the refs said Berrian was in bounds, but the ball moved a little when he hit the ground so it remained incomplete. So in a very strange way, it evened out, and the rule should be called the "Bernard Berrian rule." The worst part for Bears fans was that a rules analyst said if they correctly ID'd that Berrian was in bounds, there probably wasn't enough in replay to overturn a TD call.  https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=241226008
Every video that features the Patriots favors them.
As a lions fan I had to stop watching about halfway through... my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
It feels like the lions are in half of these
1:11 how is that not a touchdown that's boul crap
dk vs cardinals last week😭
Explain to me what a catch is at 8:57??!?!? That my home team too
Holy crap I forgot about the Jesse James call. That was crazy lmao
I'm a raiders fan but the fact he didnt say the snow game against the patriots
NFL fix your refs
rename this video roasting the ions and bears
The Pittsburgh vs patriots game was to decide who was going to the Super Bowl...   It was a dark day for me
8:51 brings back sad memories
Poor lions fans
he caught it with both hands and his LEFT *BUTTOCK* was in the in zone!
Ten second run off is one of the dumbest things ever
I wholeheartedly disagree with the rule that says the receiver has to survive the ground for it to be a completion.  If he catches the ball, turns with it, runs with it, it’s a catch!  That has cost too many teams a TD and the game.
0:00 0:26 THAT PLAYER DID NOT HAVE THE BALL SO YALL LET THE CARDINALS WIN
I hate Dee Ford for that. How do you make that mistake.
After Calvins catch the re created the concept of fully haven control of the football
There was definitely robberies here..
Hxhd
6:02 calvin johnson really said “bruh”
Don’t appreciate the photoshopped clickbait thumbnail but still decent enough video
I've learned that the Lions have been on the short end of the stick VERY often.  Respect to all Lion fans
Love how this is called game winning plays that didnt count, meaning that the catch rule bs shouldve been counted as a catch. It wouldnt be called a game winning play that didnt count if it was a clear drop
i feel so bad for lions fans
hey uh, I ain't no football fanatic but I'm pretty sure for it to be a COMPLETE PASS, have to CATCH AND CONTROL the ball? You can't just catch and let the ball go as soon as you or the ball touch the ground; In this case, what Calvin Johnson did against the Bears
God the refs really fucking hate the lions.
Just a few reasons why the NFL is trash
The NFL must hate the lions
This is an entertaining compliation....BUT....  How is a play where the ball carrier steps out of bounds before scoring considered a game winning play?
Also known as Detroit Lions highlights!
I’m not a lions fan I’m a pats fan but are you kidding me Calvin Johnson caught that ball for sure 200%
I guess it’s in the browns franchise to not be able to keep a helmet on
i'm not even a Lions fan and that Calvin Johnson touchdown ruled "no-catch" still haunts me
The Jesse James thing is bs
Lions getting screwed lol
I’ve been having a bad day, thanks NFL Throwback.
the TD by Megatron should have counted how tf did it not?
Lions vs referees.
Before this comment there is 666 likes
Aj green's toucgdown shouldve counnted. such a bad call
That cutback at 3:07 was insane!
The Calvin Johnson no catch/catch is still one of the worst calls ever.
That was bs how seattle lost he held nothing
of course yu put my team as the first one💔💔💔
Should've been deja vu for Detroit last week
As a Browns fan that Steelers td against the Pats was a screw job
Let’s all agree that the Jesse James call was bullshit. He went over the end zone line with full possession and no one touched him. Anytime someone goes over the line with full possession it’s a td no questions asked
Lol poor lions getting screwed alot
Lol @ the Lions
So many Lions plays
This is just the lions suffering lmao
The lions always getting their shit pushed in must be one hard turd to push out Lions fans😂
Should get rid of the 10 second run offs. Doesn't make sense to have them to me. Doesn't give the offense a fair chance to spike the ball.
As a Bears fan, Calvin Johnson scored that touchdown
The ref is the same how many times?
0:32 that was a catch idgaf
Jesse James caught that ball, New England did not win that game. I'll think that until the end of time, Pittsburgh beat New England there.
Lions got robbed
Alternative title: How many times have the Lions been screwed?
Miami would do that against the pats years later
HOW DID CALVINS CATCH NOT COUNT WHO HIRED THOSE REFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We all know that Megatron catch was a touchdown. Those refs sucked that game. So was Dez Bryants but not the one they showed here.
10:14 broke his ankles
If y’all ever feel like nothing is ever coming your way just remember that the lions exist
The two  calls against lions were a joke
Aaron Rodgers did not get facemasked
This video makes me miss crowds at games :(
Oh boy, seeing Detroit on the wrong end of these, so many times. Poor Lions and their fan base. Sincerely,  A bears fan.
this video should be titled "Times Refs and Terrible NFL Rules Threw the Game"
BRUH... lions stayed getting screwed
That detroit v browns game was crazy but the announcer sucked
anybody notice how the NBC logo also goes yellow when there’s a flag?
I get sad watching that dez bryant catch
13:33 As a bengals fan, I still am mad at randy bullock for throwing Joe Burrow's first game in the NFL out the window
I hate how football players have been taking lessons from Basketball players on flopping. So pathetic.
Thanks for ruining my day by showing me the Jesse James play again.
That dee ford play is still haunting
Well Calvin Johnson dropped the football at the endzone
As a Browns fan it sickens me how much they flub wins like that.  But I guess if you have Browns vs Lions, refs would prefer flub the Browns out big time.  Bottlegate anyone?
For those complaining about the TB one being a catch.....this rule by the way has been in effect for a LONG time. Announcers should at least have to know the basics of the rules. The part you will want is D).  https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/nfl-video-rulebook/ineligible-receiver/  ARTICLE 6. INELIGIBLE RECEIVERS  All offensive players other than  those identified in Article 5 above are ineligible to catch a legal or  illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage,  including:  a) Players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped.  b)  Offensive players wearing numbers 50–79, unless they have reported a  change in their eligibility status to the Referee and have assumed a  position on their line or in their backfield as required by Article 5;  c) Players who fail to notify the Referee of being eligible when required;  d) An eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, even if he has re-established himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands.  Exception: If an eligible receiver is forced out of bounds by a foul by a defender, including illegal contact, defensive holding, or defensive pass interference, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately, he becomes eligible to legally touch the pass (without prior touching by another eligible receiver or defender) as soon as he re-establishes himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands.
Could use some of these clips to a new list called "Bullshit ass calls!"
All this showed me was how bad the refs can be and/or favor certain players
10:57 had me dying....😂😂😂.
why did that big man almost jump on calvin johnson pls I'm crying
I'm a chargers fan and I still can't believe we beat the Bengals 🤣
Hey ya all Jesus loves you! I hope that news makes your day better, have a great one!
If these plays counted, they would have won the game.
I know those Calvin Johnson, Dez Bryant & Jessie James catches still hurt lmao😂😂😂
ah yes.. when football use to be fun to watch...
Do a video of game winning plays that shouldn't have counted.   Example Rodgers hail mary vs Lions.
Sucks nobody could watch the 2009 Browns-Lions game on TV because of the blackout rules
15 Most Beautiful Places In The World https://youtu.be/T33eolbNS5c
Jim Codwell. The best Coach the Loins had. I butchered the last name but to Lazy to look it up.
I'm just happy I'm not a lions fans. You poor souls.
9:49 did anyone see the bengals player tackle the wrong guy lol
6:55 incredible luck for the Chiefs!
That horrible reverse call cost the steelers the super bowl and gifted the patriots the super bowl
You forgot dez Bryant catch against Green Bay in 2014 in the playoffs
Why dk first 🤧
Gotta love how like 80% of these fails are due to refball or a team doing something to give life to their opponent.
Aaron Rodgers' Hail Mary gives me the chills with tears of joy. Go Pack go!
Hahahaha Seattle
The Rodgers “face mask” lmao
Forgot about the false start on the patriots as well during the ravens game
❤❤🇺🇸VOTE FOR TRUMP!! SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM COMMUNISM.   MAKE NO MISTAKE FOR THE GOOD OF FREEDOM.   ❤🇺🇸TRUMP🇺🇸❤
Great Video!  Two of them were to tie (yes I'm nitpicking and no they wouldn't have gone for 2)
YOUR ON TRENDING
You forgot the Browns/Ravens game from 2007  Phil Dawson hits a 51-yard field goal that bounces off of the post and the inside of the crossbar. The referees rule that it's no good, and the Ravens win. Then, after 20 minutes, and after both teams went into their locker rooms already, the play is overturned, and the kick is good. Tie game. Browns then win it in OT
NFL is rigged, I feel so bad for the Lions always getting robbed
Refs and children collectively ruin everything.
You got admit at the patriots interception was the most satisfying for a patriots fan🔴⚪️🔵😂😂😂🔥
Calvin got screwed
Nd they don’t show da den Bryant one 🥱
That Megatron catch still pisses me off.
Washington vs Vikings? 7 minutes. Rodgers could throw many TDS in that time.
will never forget 4:32. I'm entirely convinced that in another universe the Pats lost that game and won the superbowl
So we not gon realized a. Rodgers face  mask was his Jersey on my lions.  Fuck the packers they're overrated.
This should be lowlights for my lions
Nfl throw back to last sunday
I’m so sorry Lions fans
"Grabbed him by the facemask" what crock of shit
The 2nd was oof
That megatron catch was a TD
The Lions were on the losing end of so many of these
Jesse James caught that shit and crossed the plane still fucking hurt by that we could’ve had a bye in the playoffs because of that
3:24 They still won
As a Chiefs Fan myself: I have never forgotten the Dee Ford Offside Penalty. That is what costed the Chiefs not just the game, but a trip to the Super Bowl
In the greenbay v lions clip im 90% sure there was a block in the back that couldve been called on the scoring play but whatever
Great video but that Calvin Johnson TD grab was a straight robbery! Strictly on the officials. That & the "would-be" TD grab by Dez Bryant vs. Green Bay that wasn't listed here was a catch (I am not a Cowboys fan).
Did y'all make this just so Seattle wouldn't feel bad
Great vid...
Calvin Johnson and Jesse James, clear catches! NFL still doesn’t know what a damn catch is.... The Bucs one was called terribly. He re- established himself and even if that wasn’t the case, he was pushed by the Saints DB, that should of been illegal contact, way beyond 5 yds. NFL refs, straight costing teams games.
The one with Calvin Johnson just makes me mad
Whole lot of Lions
Number 83 with the Seahawks didn't have to do that!
Wow, it's amazing how many of these were against the home teams, takes a lot of conviction for the refs to follow through with the calls. Except against the Lions. They're just there to suffer.
As a dolphins fan, if the Steelers would of won that game, I would have been losing my mind!
As a Lions fan this video hurts and brings so much bad  heartbreaking moments.. :(
Megatron should have counted
nfl referes be like. the recevers arm hair was outa bounce and its incomplete
I love this!  Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory!!
Still don't know what the refs drunk on the game between the Bears and the Lions. THAT WAS A TOUCHDOWN FOR CALVIN JOHNSON (I'm not even a Lions fan)
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates❤️
The goddamn Rodgers phantom facemask to Hail Mary still haunts me...
What’s this: Aaron Rodgers getting the benefit of flags? I would have never guessed. It never happens for him or Green Bay. Especially not when they’re stopped twice but the drives get extended for hands to the face when there’s no hands to the face.
Rodgers pudgy ass did a god job selling the face mask after he got up. Taylor never hooked the mask and didn’t use it to bring him down.
How they gonna play megatron like that
No matter what you do with your life you will NEVER be satisfied. You will always have the emptiness, feeling of being incomplete In Your soul. Why do you think people who are madd rich with material things are always doing drugs and even end up killing themselves sometimes, they have everything you could imagine but remain searching to fill that emptiness. stop filling your soul with junk and false peace, false joy, false happiness... it actually destroys your soul I'm here to tell you today, you can finally stop this search and find the completion you seek for in your soul. Jesus Christ is the only one that can make your soul complete. Indirectly, you search for Jesus by being the best athlete you can be or putting all your hope in your football team, by buying every pair of Jordan's, getting drunk every night, sleeping around with females or males, you are searching for the answer to making your life complete! Those are false and/or destructive things. JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY THE ONLY TRUTH THE ONLY LIFE. JESUS died n rose again, shed His blood for you as an atonement for your sins, all you gotta do is believe in Him and what He did for you. Call out to Jesus Christ with all your heart to save you. Jesus Christ will make you complete, you will have an abundant life on esrth and more importantly, you will have everlasting life after you die, you will dwell in heaven rather than hell since your sinful soul will have been cleansed by His Holy Precious blood that He shed for you on the cross. Turn to Jesus !
they are not game winning plays if their is a penalty cause that is what mad rhem game winning
“Holy Toledo” never gets old
The International Medical Travel Journal (IMTJ) reported on May 13 and June 7 that Belgium's primary legislative body had passed a new bill on April 25 that would punish all parties involved in the buying and selling of human organs for commercial purposes, citing a recent report from The Epoch Times.  A clause in the bill references a resolution condemning forced organ harvesting in China, which was passed by the European Parliament in December 2013.   Belgium legislative body building  Violators face up to 20 years of imprisonment with a €1.2m (USD$1.35 million) fine. If an organized criminal group is involved in such trade, all individuals in the group will face punishment.  The article stipulates that the law is not only effective within Belgium; it prohibits all Belgian citizens from procuring organs, regardless of where the transaction took place, effectively banning medical tourism for organ transplants.  The regulations stipulate that the organ seller and recipient, as well as any middlemen, doctors who were consulted, or other medical workers who participated in the sale of organs for profit, will be punished under the law.  In explaining what constitutes illegal organ transplant procedures, the proposal brings up the issue of forced organ harvesting, a scenario in which organs are involuntarily removed from individuals who did not express consent. The legal text also includes a clause referencing a resolution condemning forced organ harvesting in China that was passed by the European Parliament in December 2013.  The resolution expressed deep concern over persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned for their religious beliefs, and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.  The European Parliament resolution called on China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. Belgium is the first country in Europe that refers to the European Resolution of 2013.  Despite continued evidence of widespread organ harvesting in China, by the United Nations, the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, and the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong, the trade continues and may even have increased to cope with demand.  The Belgium bill will next move to the Senate, after which the king will sign it into law. The Czech Republic also recently considered plans to reduce transplant tourism.
The unconscious is the inheritance; the memories of man. The conscious is all the recent covering; education, technology. The conscious mind has often the intimations of the unconscious and is being guided by the unconscious. It is one unitary movement. When the brain is free of that psychological knowledge then the brain is the mind because the mind is infinite.
Always the lions
Jesse James got absolutely robbed
NFL needs to pickup highlight heaven
I feel bad for all these offensive lineman that lose the game for there team
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3
For 12:13 I'm just curious how that's a game winning play when there is so much time still left. Great video nonetheless
If you wanna know what its like to be a lions fan, this video sums it up perfectly
12:24 HE FROM FLAWDA
I’m glad fez back
A game winner with 7 minutes left?
Where is the infamous "cowboys against packers" dez bryant catch?
I remember that game with donavon mcnab
Lions got fucked on like three or four of these lol
🔥
You could call the video “lions getting screwed”
https://youtu.be/_-_UF7zEoq0 u
Carson Wentz
This is on trending
1:29 I stopped my work thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
0:57 does anyone agree this is just racist or something like that was touchdown
It went from Richard Rodgers to Aaron Rodgers and then on the next play Aaron Rodgers to Richard Rodgers
Jesse James Caught That Ball
I couldn't watch any more after that Lions' pass was called incomplete. That was bad!
There was another one from the ravens patriots game in 2007  On 4th and 4 Brady threw an incomplete pass but there was a defensive pi on the ravens and the very next play Brady fires a td to gaffney
poor lions
When the ball breaks the plane, and the player has possession, of the goal line TD and the ball is dead.
9:23 that looks like a Patriots false start right there.
I’m not a lions fan but the second clip did not make any sense
8:18 lets go my sec favorite team titans well until marino got cut but i still like them :(
5:42 omg lets go packers won packers best team ever go pack go!
This is just 15 minutes of the Lions losing games lmao
0:49 I stopped my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Jesse James caught it argue with me🖕🏾🖤💛🥱
That hold by David Moore the game could of ended earlier 😢 and we would of won maybe dk stiff arms him
There should not be a 10 second runoff after reviews
Dee Ford single handedly lost them that game.
Ok I haven’t watched the video but the Jesse James play and the Calvin Johnson plays were catches don’t @ me
Announcer: it’s an interspertion and the patriots win  Patriots haters 9:32
I will never forget that Arron Rodgers Hail Mary. It would have sent the lions to the playoffs but the refs cheated us once again smh
As a niners fane that first one is amazing
Thank god they changed the rule because of the Jesse James catch! CAUSE IT WAS A FUCKING CATCH!!!!
Half of these are just lions getting messed up
Yeah the Lions are definitely cursed
I’m a Chiefs fan, but man I have to admit that the Lions get shafted on a lot of bullshit calls.
Bruh I was so mad at the metcalf one😂
I’ll be honest some of these are shitty calls by the ref. Like the Aaron Rodgers “face mask”?
Wow Megatron got robbed there.
i honestly feel so so bad lions fans dont youll
0:30  what in literal fuck where the refs thinking!
I love how the lions coach and everyone on the sideline thought it was a touchdown when the ref said the ruling stands
The Last one. Ugh that one hurt, at lest we won the year after
this is rated NSFL (not safe for Lions fans)
Alguna vez se han preguntado por que tenemos cortes de justicias,jueces,policias,milicia etc..? Esto es porque nos importa la justicia porque somos creados a la semejancia de un Dios justo.  Nosotros hemos pecado en su contra y roto sus leyes que tenemos en nuestras conciencias; cuando mentimos, adulteramos, robamos, somos orgullos, tenemos sexo antes del matrimonio, pornografia y muchas cosas mas, lo cual un Dios justo condenaria al igual que condenaria asesinato y violacion.  Dios es justo de condenarnos a todos pero en su amor y misericordia nos ofrece otro camino, el envio a su unico Hijo Jesus para que muriera en nuestro lugar por nuestras faltas y despues resucitara al tercer dia para justificarnos, para todo aquel que se arrepienta de sus malos caminos y ponga su fe en Jesus sea salvo; Como un hombre que se tira de un avion y no confia en sus brazos para salvarse sino que confia en el paracaidas, asi nosotros debemos confiar en Jesus y no en nuestras buenas obras para ser salvos", porque delante de Dios nadie se va a poder justificar por su cuenta solo atravez de Jesus, por esto Jesus es el unico camino hacia Dios..
You also forgot the “Fail Mary” that also didn’t count but the refs thought it did LOL
9:00 that was such a bullshit call
So many wrong calls here. Hate to see it
Didnt count , means its not game winning plays???? Bit of a reach...but love the channel
That Megatron catch im not even a Detroit fan and im pissed
We all know that the team jumped the one player who cost them the game
The lions got screwed in every clip lmao
Oh god the first play hurts if only there was no hold I might have won my Fantasy game and be first in the rankings
Some plays counted so the title is exactly correct
I am a hard core Steelers fan that Jesse James catch is the worst call I have ever seen in my 33 years of living. Worst call of all time
Dez caught it. TWICE.
The only play the lions ended on the right side was against the browns😂
LMAO that Antionio Brown game was the first NFL game I ever went to. I didn’t know he stepped out of bounds and was ready to lose it.
Pleased that karma came back to haunt Dee Ford a year later....
That Megatron one was 100% a catch.
Forgot when Jason Garrett iced his own kicker.
All this does is make me feel bad for Tony Romo. That guy had a snake-bitten career.
Im three minutes in and this is just too frustrating to watch. This clip is important as a historical study, not as entertainment. Too much pain...
Poor Lions fans can't catch a break
9:02 patriots vs Steelers was fixed. The refs were paid by the patriots.
Alternate title for much of this: "Potentially game-winning plays that were made possible by a penalty".  Because yeah, a whole lot of plays like this are only made possible because of the penalty that was committed and correctly called...
Seahawks vs Cardinals I remember watching that. The NFC west is a pretty fun division.
As a Lions fan this video hurt me to my core.
Jesus imagine being a Lions fan 😂😂😭
If you wanted to make a Lions low light just say that. 💀
The megatron catch should have counted. I’m not even a lions fan and I’m still mad about that call to this day. He had control, he went to the ground, the ball came out AFTER he hit the ground and the touchdown was made.
Love how the Lions are in here a lot lol must really suck to be a Lions fan
Y’all notice how many times the Patriots got bailed
Lions always getting punk’d
I still don't understand how they ruled megatron's catch as not a catch when he had to feet in and made a football move. C'mon nfl it ain't that hard .
4:26 Wow, no wonder Brian got fired after the season.
6:48 How have I never seen this?
Megatron TD was the only bad call in this entire video
That Lions vs Falcons Gokden Tate call was absurd,so glad we got payback from the Falcons last week thanks to Gurley TD
As a Steelers fan, I was so sad from the AB one cuz he was out after almost pulling off a miracle, but that Jesse James one was clear robbery 😤😔
That Jessie James one hurts
Yo that megaton catch was absolute bs the nfl should be ashamed he caught that
why was Bradshaw's run on this? the Giants did end up winning the game and technically we wouldnt know if that would've won the game
The ground can NOT CAUSE a fumble smh. Green Bay packer fan saying it like it is. Smh. To the artist of this channel thsys just good knowing your gonna likes my friend. Lol. For that alone.... Liked and subscribed 😁🎶 rock star shot rite there
The ruling on the field stands that official at 1:10 is a f**king idiot
I did lsd for the first time during that KC vs Oakland game, not only was the game crazy but it looked like they were playing in outer space lmao
i'm not even a Lions fan and that Calvin Johnson touchdown ruled "no-catch" still haunts me
That Antonio Brown one with the Dolphins hurt so bad as a Steelers fan watching it air
Aaron Rodgers gets saved by God every time and still can’t make the sb
Jesse James caught it
That was a Catch!!!! by Calvin Johnson.
6:55 incredible luck for the Chiefs!
That cutback at 3:07 was insane!
As a Dolphins fan when I first saw that Steelers game winner I literally cried. And then it didn't count and I was obviously happy.
How did Calvin Johnson’s catch not count?
Would have won this week in fantasy this week if David Moore didn’t hold the guy in the first clip
Should we call them “Game-Losing Plays” since it didn’t count?
The Jesse James call was bullshit of  course vs the patriots  it’s not like that team hasn’t been on the receiving end of every miserable call in NFL history  Like the tuck rule  which turned into an all new set of rules called Bradys rules which is much different than the regular NFL rules
Anne do a video of game losers that should have co7 Ted- tuck rule, offsides against the chiefs, etc
5:25 He didn't grab him by the face mask. His thumb brushed up against the mask. That should have been reviewed. If i was a Lions fan i would have been livid and screaming like an animal at that bs.   9:22 It looks like they just gave up. One guy was just watching. He didn't even move.
The PTSD from Jesse James
Pats Nkeal Harry out of bounds call, cost the patriots a first round bye.
Bro what the FUCK was that call on the lions!?
I see alot of hoeing against the Lions in this video. Sorry Lions fans
That Calvin Johnson one was ridiculous at the time and is even more ridiculous now
12:12 there is like a solid 7 minutes left lmfao
The guy from the browns who threw his helmet had me 😭 so many funny moments 😂
for the hail mary from ragders the commantater said rodgers to rodgers
Seahawks lost Sunday was so incredible nfl throwback needed to come back to make a video just cause of it
god that calvin johnson catch is the worst call ever in my opinion
Stafford is so awesome
3:29 since when are the lions and falcons undefeated
With the raiders vs chiefs part  Eh the 3rd times the charm
Don't care what you say packers are the luckiest abd cheapest team in the league
I knew before watching that the lions were gonna be in alot of these... I was correct
You ever notice that a trash miami dolphins team always beats one of the best teams late in the season to mess the good teams playoffs and screw up the dolphins draft pick
Ahhh Mannn that AB one kills me every time I see it🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️, Jesse James caught that😤😤😤 & where’s the one when the Chiefs player got called for holding on My Steelers in the playoff game recently... Anyway to anybody that’s watching this remember y’all, Keep Going & Be Safe 🤟🏾💯
As a falcons fan 3:32 should have been a td
As a Steelers fan I remember I broke a Mirror, a TV remote, and a flower pot when AB stepped out.  Edit: The Jesse James catch was even worse. I damn near burnt my house down after that bullshit call 😂😂😂
Forgot the Catch with Dez on greenbay
I was so pissed on the Jesse James call he caught it smh
0:24 so we gonna ignore they called Patrick Peterson “Kevin Peterson”
At least the Lions were on the winning side against the browns
Let me guess this was made because of the Seahawks Cardinals game
Loving the content! Thank you
megatron and dez l’s catches were painful
7:48 it gets edited out, but initially the Lions put Daunte Culpepper out to run that play (Matt Stafford was hit hard on the prior play) and the Browns' coach called an inexplicable timeout that actually let Stafford back into the game to throw that touchdown pass
Jesse James caught that ball
If I was still watching the joke of professional sports the catch rule should be revised
Jesse James scored
I’m still mad about that Steelers Jesse James catch no catch
Who misses the loud crowd in the field? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
This video is why I don't get why Gene Stattore is a "expert" when the NFL reviews plays on CBS You missed the Cowboys/Packers no catch in the playoffs Also the Saints/Rams no call in the NFC championship
Had the Ravens not called that timeout and the stopped counted, the Patriots wouldn’t have gone undefeated in 2007
The first seahawks game was hard to watch...
You should do touchdowns that shouldn't have counted
I'm aware Thom Brennaman called the Calvin Johnson and Dez Bryant plays on this video and they were replaced by the radio content. I mean, it's your video man, but you are an absolute fruitcake if you are getting rid of his audio because of his hit mic incident.
1:56 AB's CTE kicked in on that play
The 1st one haunts me😭
You saw Moore throw back metcalf’s td and then was like, hey that’s a good video idea
Something has to be done about the ruling on the golden Tate play. I understand the purpose of a 10 second run off but I shouldn't be penalized because the refs got the call wrong
How was the vikinga vs football team a game winner there were 7 minutes left
That Calvin Johnson play is an absolute travesty. Straight robbery.
I swear this video is half full of lion games lol
Lions got screwed most of the time
Watching the megatron TD and I still have no idea how that wasn’t a catch. Also Dez caught it
Hi NFL Throwback! Thanks for sharing these awesome stories! :D
The one with D.K Metcalf made me mad
I love when you make vids
Megatron's TD is a TD coming from a bears fan.
...and the most depressing thing about the SEA/ARI clip at the beginning is that the very next play resulted in a game-losing interception.
How did y'all break my heart on the first play😭
Billick calling that timeout in essence cost the Pats a SB win and propelled the Giants to a SB run. If Billick doesn’t call that timeout and that 4th down stop stands Pats lose that game and the weight on an undefeated season is over. I feel that weight was a factor in the Pats not being as dominant late in year and playoffs which lead to SB loss to Giants. Without that undefeated weight I think they dominate in playoffs and easily win SB. Now my logic with the Giants is a I feel they don’t even make a SB if Pats lose that Ravens game. Pats already have a loss and now that season finale vs Giants loses its luster. Pats and Giants probably sit their starters most of that game and Giants don’t get that momentum they got by playing close to an undefeated Pats team hence no SB run. My butterfly effect theory on that Billick timeout
At least the Dez Bryant call was a little understandable
wow the tate call looked like a bad call
Lions fan, I don't know why I decided to watch this.
Looks like Detroit got screwed again
Man. Tough to be the Lions.
Poor loins man
It’ll forever haunt me that the Ravens could’ve ruined the Pats’ perfect season
Think about that Dez Bryant play (11:35):  If he's inbounds, then the TD counts. If the TD counts, then most likely Dallas wins that game. If Dallas wins that game, then most likely Dallas wins the division and not the Giants. If Dallas wins that division and not the Giants, then the Giants never make the playoffs, therefore, never go to the Super Bowl and never beat the Patriots.  In a way, a few inches determined the rest of the 2011 NFL season.      ...talk about butterfly effect.     Edit: I'm a dumbass. The Dez Bryant play was in 2012.
This stuff is infuriating me I can't watch anymore
Just got a tooth filling, nice to come back home to this :)
2 of these the Refs not knowing what a catch is lol just saying and one nodes to Tom Brady and you cannot tell me thats not suspect
And the Oscar goes to parish cox.
From a saints fan, I know how refs fuck some teams... my condolences to Detroit fans.
Jesse James caught it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Megatron and Golden Tate ones where painful as hell to watch as a Lions fan.
the first clip got me for a sec, thought it was monday lol
I really thought the Seahawks won but they shouldn’t have been holding
Where did elliot Harris go
Did Highlight Heaven did the video?
These were some dark days for the Ravens.
The flop on the Jimmy Graham TD ticks me off to this day...
6:15 I swear I haven't seen a Game-winning Touchdown get called back because of holding since this play. Especially not against the Cowboys.
It must suck being a Lions fan.
The chiefs vs  browns game in  2002 was crazy man!!. Only the browns can lose that way.
I can't believe that catch in the first clip wasn't a touchdown. Lions got screwed big time by the refs. No excuse for that terrible call.
hey nfl throwback i really would like to see some more of the Legendary Team highlights. i would want to see like the 85 bears,Greatest show on turf and more
Detroit got their revenge on Atlanta this past Sunday
Face reveal
0:34 I'm amazed it took 7 years to get rid of this putrid rule. Coming from a Cowboys hater (obviously).
6:02 calvin johnson really said “bruh”
Can someone explain to me how the Calvin Johnson play vs the bears wasn't a catch?
They robbed Bryant for that touchdown man
I know those Calvin Johnson, Dez Bryant & Jessie James catches still hurt lmao😂😂😂
3:25 I think the Lions were screwed on that play. The Lions were basically here 1/3 of the video. If that play stood as a touchdown the Lions finish 10-6 and make the playoffs that year and the Lions don't fire Jim Caldwell.
What about the even more infamous Dez no catch against the packers?!
If it does not count, then it's not a game winner.
Lions always get robbed
knew that play from sunday night had to be here
How many times the Lions gone be on here DAMN LOL 😂
In the first 100 commments
MOST of the penalties were actually good calls
As a Steelers fan, idk what hurts worse. That dolphins game to clinch a playoff spot or that patriots game to earn top the top seed
Where's the Steelers/Bengals Wild Card game  with Burfict's dirty hit on Brown?
So painful watching that Jesse James play again. I'm glad they fixed the catch rule, that was terrible.
I think the refs in that lions game were on crack
13:32 When you can't tell if it's a 2020 game for the Bengals or if it's a regular season game from any other year
Y’all stay dick riding the Seahawks!!!
Didnt start watching yet but can’t wait to see dez Bryant’s hand on the goal line vs my giants
Imagine how the Ravens beating the 11-0 patriots would stack up against the biggest upsets in nfl history if Rex Ryan hadn't called that timeout
God damn it David Moore. God. Damn. It.
The metcalf didn’t count they did hold em !!
That Dez Bryant catch against New York, that was just unbelievable
HELLO NFL THROWBACK  Been loving the awesome content 👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🏈 🏈 🏈
I’m sexy and I know it
That holding car in that first clip was very, very sketchy, to say the very least. Why can't all the levels of football come together and redefine holding as just pulling the defender to the ground? Like, I am pretty sure that we are way past the "grabbing outside of the numbers" horseshit by now. Who's with me?
Megatron getting called back Is a worse call than the saints rams game
Good old lions
More like “How the NFL screws the Lions”
I think that Megatron catch was one of the reasons he retired, amongst others (the lions org is a pos and why Sanders retired)
NFL Throwback copying a page out of HH and Ding’s playbook be like: (Not trying to hate on this channel, just pointing something out, I love it)
Football fans piss me off... I bet you people would argue that Antonio Brown call these days. Its always the fuckin refs fault.
Throwback. Is. Back
Bro imagine being a steelers fan seeing AB scoring a touchdown but instead he was out of bounds
I’ve been having a bad day, thanks NFL Throwback.
The Lions were on the losing end of so many of these
This is just the lions suffering lmao
The ecstasy & the agony.
The beginning kinda hurts me as a Seahawks fan. But we move on.
4:40 what a catch by Vernon Davis
You forgot the Browns/Ravens game from 2007  Phil Dawson hits a 51-yard field goal that bounces off of the post and the inside of the crossbar. The referees rule that it's no good, and the Ravens win. Then, after 20 minutes, and after both teams went into their locker rooms already, the play is overturned, and the kick is good. Tie game. Browns then win it in OT
0:20 It's a real shame because that touchdown cost me a win in fantasy and I lost by one.
Every game the falcons played should be in this one lol
Green Bay fans watching this video thinking about the Fail Mary
here before the Jimmy Graham Hail Mary vs the Niners
hello nfl throwback, back again. Love the content
That TD by Megatron should have counted as a bears fan!!
Right On Time
