3:50 birds poop as a reflex when they are suprised. my unproven hypothesis is, the reason birds poop on cars is they are startled by the sunlight reflected of the windshields.

Jimmy needs to react to the full clip about Christopher Plummer telling Peter Jackson that he knows how a person sounds when they are stabbed, from experience.
1:00 only in ohio 💀
