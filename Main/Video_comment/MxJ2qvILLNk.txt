Bro not here for the song
X
music video wise first person shooter>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> not like us
When Shaq said this is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life... That definitely did not age well😂😂😂
Very great music video
Jully 2025 who here
Drake being Canadian and J Cole being from the North Carolina ain't got nothing to do with who's better at ping pong😂
Drake🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
June 2025 who here?
J. Cole
Kendrick is ashole im here to here shots at him but havent heard
3:00  thats why i said its pure parsality against  drake
Drake the Fake...No goat here... greatest at acting and playing the role of a rapper . Biggest SCAMMER in the music industry.
And the rest was history
The one song that started the whole shit
One of the best drake songs🎧
The best YouTube channel to take things serious and Laugh in the same time 🤣
And now he suing you!!!  He a lame!😂
Trying to hear the so called Kendrick shot in the song and still haven’t heard it
Drake is not 6ft2 he's 6ft1 future and French Montana are 6ft2 and they're slightly taller
this is where the Rap war started
the score was a easteregg, drake or cole has a song where he says 7 9 6 9 multiple times in a row
How did this video not win video of the year ??! Awards are such bs.
Love it when they argue the hardest MC, Is it K Dot Is it Aubrey or me?   The hip hop's Franz Ferdinand moment

6:35 moments before bro relaised
Who's back after Kendrick destroyed Drake
5:22 HERE WE GO
i cant mentally vigure out your accent
Can you act and speak normal.
Who’s here after Drake got buried on Not Like Us?
PLEASE DON'T DAM GOD BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN TO PEOPLE ABD WE LOVE U SHAQ HERE IN ARKANSAS AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER LISTENS WITH ME  SO PLEASE TRY NOT 🚫 TO SAY GD
only thing drake is a goat at is being an entertainer lol
who here after he reacted to the not like us music vid
bbl drizzy and grippy
You ride their meet but when Kendrick comes out you forget that🤦🏿‍♂️🤡
It’s….it’s….it’s..hmmmmm GRIPPY😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You cant lie. Video was too notich!
I dont get it. Cole complimented kendrick but kendrick took offense to it?
Drake is the goat
As a streamer on twitch, it is an absolute privilege to be called a sweat and tryhard on call of duty by the one and only coach!!  Dabo_sweeney103 for anyone who cares lol
Looking back, isn't it crazy that this song alone set off a chain reaction that would set the rap industry on FIRE!!!!!!!! obviously, there was pre tension between kdot and Drake, but wooooooo woooooo
Wait can somebody tell me, am I reaching drake just said I searched names i see 20 teens(tines reference to the names) always sus bars
you said you ain't gon pause too much
IDC bout the rap beef, DRAKE NO.1 for sure
😂😂hmmmm
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇹🇳 Allah Akbar
After Cole apologized to K dot & dot destroyed bbl drizzy I'm laughing my ass off watching this video again
8:11 beat drop is too fye 🔥
@8:22  Drake was telling us ahead of time.  He saw what was coming.  "I hate you (Kendrick) been selling them some false dreams...I'm the one they gon try and boycott...I'm one away from Micheal, nigga beat it"...he knew he was rising up too high, getting too big, for too long, he knew they was going to try and take him down.  Even the video of the statue is throwing it in their faces, like "I'm too big for ya'll to stop me...and honestly, right now, they took their best shot, but when the dust settles, Drake still going to be on top, watch and see
Who's after the beef??
This is butterfly effect
Drakes last verse switch up is fucking goofy 😂
I think this wat started the beef drake was sneak dissing
Little did we know this would kick off a rap war. Team KDOT.😂
Anyone here after the kendrik and drake beef?
drake good at basketball tho
This whole thing aged like milk😂
I noticed all of the reactors went the crazies' on Drake's part.  That what makes him the goat.  He is the full package. He brings lyricism,  disses,  and great visuals all at the same time while making a hit song out of it. He doesn't have to sacrifice anything.
Now this is why Kendrick dropped a diss verse 😂😂
No more big 3 like dey started a league , its just K dot at top of pile
KDOT smoked this video.
Who here after Kendrick's diss? 😂
Broo shaq got me dying , he aint even care about the song he just want cole to win😂
Shaq....! Pele entered the chat (KDOT)
That Drake money made this freaking music video. Amazing. I really wanna know how much this video cost.
After coming back to this song. Kdot might really be the goat😭
lol who else came back here after the new Kdot verse
the goat is ye
Who's here after the Kendrick Diss ?
Who came here after  Kendrick's diss to Drake and J.Cole..😢
Lls i always said the same thing slim, my hair get like that im going Michael Jordan
those k9 dogs gonna get buried in the pet cemetery 😂😂😂
Came back to this video after what Kendrick had to say 😭
Here after Kendrick go and diss drake and cole... Man shits crazy 👌💯
J Cole cooked drake
drake really had to show what he meant by saying “BIG AS THE WHAT” 😂😂😂
i love how he was more interested in the ping pong game than the track lmao
Drake actually isnt trash at basketball
Is it me or did I hear drake say he checked his phone and seen twenty teens?
Shaq do a reaction to Acal shook ones remix. Shit fire bro! 🔥
We see how my manz biased lol he want Cole to win so bad. Canada stand up 🇨🇦
Drake’s swag is just different ain’t no one so smooth bro viva da 6IX
I looked away and you said “youuuu ni***” 🤣🤣
Drake cannot come close to J cole
No life shaq favour Drake, he's not yet to react to Kanye West 'Vultures (Havoc Version)'
NCCC
I told Jimmy Jam I use a grammy as a doorstop 😂😂😂😂😂
The end scene is a scene from Krypton on tubi.
6:40 drake is trash i minute later 7:40
he cant beat me but he can hoop😂😂😂
i usually hate drake song but this one was fire asf😂
Yo, that was lit!
Hey listen to Superfriends Worlds Finest... the remix lol lol .... good listen ... (ps...i dont listen to drake no more cause he sings too much but that one i cant hate on)
Shaq missed drakes smooth ass mj spin
He can’t beat me but he can hoop 😂😂😂
Would've made this video that much harder if they had him talk like Kevin in the intro 😂😂😂iykyk
I'm late and I have never broken down anything so far but just hear me out:  1. Surface level Demon Deacons attending a wake 2. Demon Deacons the team, Wake University 3. Two different dubs Demon Deacons = Double D, Wake = W/Dub 4. There are two different times people look down at someone during a the entire funeral ceremony, during the Wake and during the burial. Demon Deacons = D. D. = Doubling Down. 5. He's taking your favorite rapper's people, turning them into Demon Deacons/They are Doubling Down(as in double agents) and letting Cole murder their favorite rappers/attending your Wake.  Last one might definitely be me stretching for a 5th entendre.
dog barkin at the end show how real it is
We need METAL HEAD SHAQ
Shaq you missed that Russia Ukraine bar
I love drake but jada kiss. Wayne .im having a hard time picking ....shout out shyne
Lol u forgetting. Jadakiss. Fabulous. Kayne.common still alive .lol
Legendary 🎉
The best ever reaction i ever Seen 🔥🔥.bro you are Amazing.
Shaq! Your positivity just brightened my day I been goin thru it fr lately dawg thank you!
Real man can real talk
The way Shaq turned up with Drake is classic!!!
Nah drakes not that good lol, just hype. Cole tho, 😮
Get off this nigha 🍆 damnnnn you riding harder than the beat
All them people worshipping a man and his statue...smh....if people would just put that much effort into worshipping the only one who deserves it and the only one who should be worshipped....our LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS ....this place would be so much better...JESUS deserves all praise and worship...🙏
You alredy lost
Damn insane clip 😂
Man disrespected the guck outta kevin 😂😂😂
Coles albums are quality tho
I love the office dude 😂
Cole brought the bars and Drake brought the vibes. Both did their part perfectly!
Fire shirt my boy. Christ is Lord.
Real talk though...... it's iconic because I think Drake bought Michael Jacksons glove.... I could be wrong g but check it put bro....
Las Cabras!!! The Goats!!!!! 🐐🐐🐐🐐
They look alike
He’s not wrong about call of duty
“Somebody Win”😂😂😂😂 4:05
I wish Drake had brought something lyrical to the table in this song because J Cole killed it and Drake following him up kinda ruined the vibe for me
that 2 yr old bar was kinda clever ngl
Yo Shaq, you need to react to world's finest: first person shooter by Acevane, it's a pretty solid parody and the bars kinda go hard too
Aye shaq Get Good In That Cod So I can Killstreak Ya 😂😂😂
Shaq would make great adlibs🤣
Can’t even hear the song. Buddy pause every 5 sec and yelling over music…. Lol
you already know who win, you sang with him in his verse 😂😂😂😂
Drake sound like he stole nardo flow on a nardo beat too
The way you pointed and told me to stop spamming you to react to this made me feel guilty... and i ain't even say nothing lol
Sick
When he was reviewing the ping pong score, I DIED!
So the video was The Office Referance and when Drake shot his Hoop around the world he passed his album The Views the building he was sitting on years ago.
Some video
Mannnn!!! The hardness in this song and video is soooo refreshing!
Your reactions are hilarious!!!! This reaction was too enjoyable!
🔥❤️
DRAKE IS CANADAS VERY OWN!!
That 666 hand symbol at the end was blatant as hell. Drakes satanic af
And then eminem walks in and it's like shanks walking into an area and dropping his Conqourers haki 😂😂
Real Talk. The reason i subscribed this nigga is because he got EMINEM at the back of his background🥶🥶😌
Bro we need moreeee
ngl for any of you not liking drake or even cole for that matter.. now all this sudden this tough? get tf outta here we don’t want you around. these two stay goated fr.
Cole scored that because all his album he releases are immediate hits, drake own went around the corner to remind people that criticize him that his albums always comes back to do numbers, no matter how long or how bad he drops them
Messi and Ronaldo 💯.. Both GOATS 🐐
Na shaq on 4 milll
When you realize people that never watched The Office exist 😂
What’s wrong with Canada bro hahaha
Bro wearing Michael Jackson’s glove 🥶🥶🥶
Why the fake reaction tho?
Yo the micheal reference is going to have some people in they feeling lol
Yeahh Fayetteville💪🏾🔥
Track and Video are absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥  Both went crazy!
No life bro what's the name of the song in the background?
D flowers chicken freestyle🔥🔥
D flowers chicken freestyle🔥🔥
Chicken freestyle by D flowers I’m a big fan of y’all both I know for a fact it’s worth it🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Antichrist symbolism
Dope beanie 😎
I’m native! Do I get a nigga pass. ?🤣🤣🤣🤣
RRAL RAP I SOIT LIKE NATE
J cole goat but drake No Why all fan drake ?
This video and song are goated instantly!
these buddies  deserve more than da get
That Michael reference is so insane on First Person Shooter because for one people forget how massive Michael Jackson was. He puts everyone alive to shame with how big of a crowd he single handedly could draw. Beat It was his top hit ever and Drake truly saying all it takes is one more hit single and I’m the new King in a new genre on that list given Drake the only hip hop artist that far up. 🔥  Idk how Shaq didn’t react to that line harder.
Do a reaction to trippie redd new album!!!
I got a jumper like Jordan wit curry range🏀💯
I'm not even a Drake fan (K Dot and J Cole all the way), but this was 🔥🔥🔥
Please check out "Tim" "sonder album".. 🙏🙏
Dnj trigga.  trap house is cold
So drake was Messi in the pic the goaaaat
That New Call of Duty be 🔥🔥🔥🔥 mans, you Anit like those 😅😂
The whole Michael Jackson interpretation from 8:40 on only Drake could pull off.. Not a lot of people caught that and with the white glove.. Then how he ends the video with the sculpture like Michael Jackson's album cover to "History: Past, Present and Future" is dope..
React on Woh Rat- Raftar ft. KR$na
dissing my mans kevin in the begginning
Come on Shaq, you can't rep NC and miss that Wake Forest demon deacon bar
It's like a Marvel movie.
This like if bron and kd laced em up on the same team together 🔥🔥
Shaq most time's I listen to them spit words I just sit back and smile ❤❤❤
That honey bun didn't stand a chance😂😂 Shaq
J cole split bars ❤
He’s had that hair since the office even
Yall can’t talk about Kendrick he ain’t even coming out with no songs like Drake and Cole.
Not the they try hards he trippin
Graphics are outrageous 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The score 79-69 is reference to the song 7969 on the album
best ever hip hop song and video
They both so GOATED 🔥🔥🔥
Music video of the year.. Joe Budden gonna be tight lmfao
Coleworld 4 lyf
Top 2 in this bitch!
Lmao cool out pointing at me bruh
They broke YouTube lit
This is the most trash reaction that Shaq did so far
Your dog knew his assignment. 😂
beg you react to pen game rap battle. the one with forever tapped vs the girl her violated. UK rap battle, it gets disrespectful.
It’s like we recruited your homies to be demon deacons we got em attending your wake  Holy shit that is a hard ass bar
When shaq dan that then i felt it 😂
Not gonna lie but the worst part of watching a reaction video is how they stop every 10 seconds into a song to speak for a minute like just play the song and react while listening
Cole destroyed Drake 🤦🏾💪🏾bars
Next years Spider-Man meme gonna be Shaq👉🏽ghost
Didn’t drake and j coke have beef like 2 weeks ago
Shaq talking about that hair😂😂
Great video..wild. I haven't seen great, wild, fun video since Busta Rhymes and Misty Elliott days. You right.. we can't lose to Table Tennis internationally..🤣🤣🤣
Great video Drake is him 👌🏾
Now the question. Should Drake build a statue of himself in Canada?
Kendrick cole and drake been kings of rap for over a decade
BasketCOLE 😏🔥
Drake shot one hell of a air ball
Big as the wha🗣️🗣️
🤣😂 Bro said somebody win!
This may or may not go down as Drake's Top 10 maybe 15 songs of all time.. And all the credit goes to Cole.. this whole album was nothing without this one track and you goin hard to the Drake verse?!?!?!
Shaq you get it MFs be sweats on COD real talk lmao 🤣
I didn’t even see the score, but now that you mention it I feel like it’s a 7969 shoutout somehow lol
DREAMVILLE for life period !!!
Nah that Messi/Ronaldo remake was colddddd 🥶🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥
MW3 you tripping bro play with some SUBs bro the game slow pace my guy ttk mad slow bro get that weight up bro 😂😂😂
I’m SPAM you bro 😂😂😂 YOU BRO!!! We playing calling of DUTY !!
This video reminds me of OTIS
Thats Kevin in the beginning 😂
Towards the end ion know if anyone noticed but at the end Drake had the white glove for Michael Jackson cuz he's tied
Great reaction as always but guys, Is it just me or i feel the Ronaldo Vs Messi thing is a disrespek to JCole. Drake is a great great artist however they were rapping and Drake is not on Cole's level. If it was Kendrick vs Cole, then hell yeah. As i was listening to it i couldn't help wonder if what Drake was spitting was his own thoughts put into rhymes by him..... and that is simply not  Messi's or the goat,..Ronaldo's level. Same way if the comparison was who the most successful artist is... even Cole said he doesn't have the Drake effect. That wouldn't be a Ronaldo Vs Messi rivalry either. That loud do make you think tho.😉
Best music video N best reaction video🔥👏🏿
Cole x Drake x Kendrick & Eminem x Joyner x Logic are the collabs I've always wanted
actually fun fact J Cole never finished college, he was given an honorary degree years later.
Dope video that Spiderman meme reference and Messi n Ronaldo chess scene 🔥🔥🔥
Shaq I know you do mostly reacting on videos but can you do reactions for power  ? Got 4 different books maybe you can do reactions for an episode once a month or something I think alot of ypur fans will love that also ? Like the comment if this makes sense to you.
The video was a mini movie lmaooo
Shaq yb album only 18 songs come on bro 🙏🏽
What if Kendrick was also on this track🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This has definitely set standards for music vid of the year😂
Jcole had a mad verse but made it a classic and a bang
This is what happens with no budget dawg
And their video didn’t have a bunch of half naked women slinging fake cake around. Drugs weren’t scattered everywhere. And money wasn’t all stacked and flying around. This the best music video in years. Easy.
I never thought Shaq would have been a drake hater
Song is trash. Culture is broken. Never seen you on your knees so long… open wide😮
That shit was a movie  🔥
You Shaq you know you a real one!!!??? Cause after this vidéo YT propose me a lot of other creators. I watched a lot of them (cause the vidéo is lit!) none of them analyse the vidéo like you do. It's like they don't know nothing.... on the reaction you the goat my man Shaq. like from faaar away the best!
J cole is dope but I really can't take drake serious..his voice alone drives me nuts..lol guy does pop music..I never see adult men listening to him..its kids and girls..not that there is anything wrong with that..just not my cup o tea.
Broooo
I’m guess he hasn’t. Wash the office.
Nothing but sweats fr haa
Hello.. can you please react to the song "STRAYDOGS MV" and "ROCKSTA MV" and also "BULAN MV" by FELIP .. also please do checkout his COMPLEX EP Visualizer with songs (SUPERIORITY, CRIMINAL, DRINKSMOKE, MICTEST).. thanks so much
Shaq came for the video but clearly ignored tha fact that chess scene was a recreation of Ronaldo messi chess picture.... With the same Fking background
By far the best video of the year! 🔥🔥🔥
Maybe man by AJR would be a sick reaction
BRO NEW DRAKE AND COLE EVILWAYS IS HARD
Thank You Lord Jesus.
Do guts over fear by Eminem!!!!
Fayetteville native here cole is a killer
Where's the reaction to Drakes new EP?
that spiderman basketball scene was the best part!!! 🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️
Is he rocking the actual Michael Jackson glove that he bought at auction… as he’s depicted as the new age MJ
This MF hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The part where they are playing chess it's a reference from the iconic picture of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi the two greatest footballers ever playing chess for a LV marketing campaign. This video is outrageously legendary.
Reaction for Race War- Tom MacDonald and Adam Calhoun “Whiteboyz”!!!
Nah bruh that’s a solid nod to The Office, that’s Kevin bruh, that show is funny af
What I learned today is the Carolinas take their ping pong very seriously
video of the year that shit was insane
Now I wanna hear j cole & EM 😮
That Messi/Ronaldo recreation moment was 🔥
Ain't no way Drake is 6'2
YOU NEED TO SHOW EZ MILL SOME LOVE #facts
Do you know that Drake just did scary hours 3 in him and j Cole on another number one record
WE NEED A REACTION ON Welcome 2 College Grove- 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne. Hardest album of the year
coast contra - "disruptive freestyle" 🔥🔥🔥
When Shaq said he lowkey forgot about the song, I was like “fr”. That’s how you know the video was great
J.Cole definitely not losing to Drake in HORSE
how did he miss mj reference
Production is insanely good in this
You damn sho ain’t lying about the CoD sweats. Them dudes kill me before my damn screen lights up.
The dogs could be a reference to the dogs in wet dremz and how drake got more as well as the tower from the feel no way album from drake
What you got against people from Canada
This video was too good. Made me realise I slept on the track
THE GOAT REACTOR ON YOUTUBE PERIOD!!!!!

5:00 you acting like Drake isn't smart lmao they're both smart
the video is so hard bro the references go crazy
where's the kid laroi album reaction???
I'm so disappointed in how you react to videos now.  Time to unsubscribe.  Your reactions are too predictable, and you spend too much time getting up and walking away.  Instead of breaking things down from your viewpoint ✌️
Reaction and song trending 😎
You missed so many things looking at the camera.
It's like he answered  the phone to @nolifeshaq  No life shaq: "You playing call of duty" Brian: "no, no, no, no ,no  😂😂
If you're in the US let's make a postpaid deal I'm in africa and would like a postpaid to order stuff.. you'll receive the orders..take your commission and ship the rest to me..lets work together and make so much money
Im not gonna lie this shit hard but if kendrick and drake decides to make a song together bro internet is gonna shut down for realllll
Nice,bro you like Cole too much though 😂
For the money it took to make this video Drake could have fed all of Miami again two times over. Only Drake and Cole and a select few others could do it like this.

Drake is simply one of the Greatest Rappers of this generation and the previous one   But lil Wayne if he was ended to that Drake beat when it switched the entire would break and the song would Definitely be Nominated for a Grammy😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥    But I’m hoping Kendrick & Cole before they Hang it up The least they could do is Bless the wrld a with joint album fr😂😂😂
He missed drake hitting the move at the end
Leave Kevin alone lmao😂
@nolifeshaq please dive into afrobeats
MJ was that Hard … Drake know
I mean Cole can be one of those 2, but Drake? Drake is more like a ball boy, a ball boy who has someone else do all the work for him yet he takes the credit.
Idc who u are…don’t EVER disrespect Kevin from the office

4:40 the gloves, glowing tilles and the HIStory Michael Jackson statue reference is crazyy
Nah, the vid is lit asf🧯🔥
I’m HEADING in that direction just like dude! 2:03 I’m gonna hold on for dear life! I can’t cut it! ( Song in the background… CUT IT! CUT IT! CUT IT!)

The Office and Spider man Reference was dope af
reaction awkward af. missed half of the reference and inspirations.
Trash
Knocked drakes house down once he said YOUNGBOYS name haha
This is one of my favorite videos so far from him I love the Michael Jackson References.
I lost all respect for Drake for wat he did to X
The Best part of the song (the only good) is J Cole Fr

Its crazy Shaq didn't even know who the guy on the opening was 😂
REAL NIGGAS KNOW “THE OFFICE” and Kevin shit was the hardest intro ever.
That's "I showspeed " barking there😂😂😂
bounty killers on this remix would be great all goats first artist to rock supper bowl🙏🏿🙏🏿👍👍👍👍
Bruh sound like his nose stuffed 😂
3:26 the 7969 score might be a referring to one of the songs on the album: 7969 Santa
we knew it would be a banger
0:55 Ayo PAUSE
We have to spam you so you can upload more😭

my exact reaction when i saw the vid shaq
Yeahhhhhh🔥🔥🔥🔥
Need you to react jack harlow loving on me
The symbolism in the beginning... Drake and Cole, 1 & 2 going back and forth? to playing chess? IS CRAZY!!!
Yea the games in the videos are lit
Shaq Where is the first time album reaction by the kid laroi at? Or the label said no
Listen to ON THE RIVER OFFSET freestyle
yo shaq, where yb new album reaction at?
If anyone noticed Drake's height in the boxing scene is a callback to his bar on On the Radar Freestyle: "You know I'm like 6'2" in the right shoe, love, but you love off some medium guys".
Canada > carolina or whatever you call it
One of the best videos in a minute fr Shaq
Drake ain’t 6’2 😂
Shaq come play zombies with me I’m on ps5
They checked all the boxes with this one🔥🔥🔥
Youngboy
No such thing as an IQ better than yours no such thang no such thang 😜

Team OVO
6ix🍁

Giving world cup vibes Shaq that messi and Ronaldo chess photo before the world cup

Haha this reaction gold
C’mon shaq you were glazing the hell outta jermaine
me now just realizing when drake say he one away from mj he meant albums
Bro did not catch the Messi n ronaldo ref😭
I bet $50 right now that this will be the 2024 NFL Superbowl Anthem. Guarantee. This has all the vibes of a dope ass intro for commercial!!!! I like this. They need more legends collabing like this. EM, Lil Wayne,JAYZ, Cole. Get some new songs, but legends together. This was fire though! Thanks Shaq for this one!
react to NLE choppa Pistol paccin!!
It takes J Cole to make zesty drake to bring his A game. 😂😂😂😂 where the fuck was this drake at?
im ded from unc shaq saying drake aint getting past cole on chess lmaooo
So many Easter eggs in this video 🔥🥵🤟
Shaq did you see what that idiot Soulja boy said about J Cole?? Been waiting on your reaction
Video of the YEAR reaaaleeest talk ...the MJ reference is Goated
Imagine after Cole sees this he challenges shaq to basketball 😂😂😂😂😂
Holy that music vidn🤯
shaq we need a laroi album reaction
Drake murdered it wordplay wise He knows hes the greatest
its MESSI vs RONALDO nigga..
Soon as Drake took off that mask and grabbed the ball with a spiderweb it was over. Shot the ball around the world passed the Toronto tower, made the goal melt into the floor, transformed from a wolf, made the same facial expressions as the dog person, did a Micheal Jackson spin into a different fit, as a New York excited riot full of dogs went crazy and a gigantic statue of Aubrey is unveiled with helicopters 🚁 and spotlights………… man wtf like he said. Top ten vids of all time. We love cole but shyt fam. Who da goat 🐐
Best thing in this vid is Kevin
Waiting for the reaction to Eminem Don't Front ft Buckshot Don't Front plz Shaq
Drake had ghost writers though 😢
Do yb album
This video has nothing on Ronaldo and Messi though 😳 nothing about soccer 😅
Shaq constantly dissing drake was so fuckin funny
How is he not gonna know who Kevin is 😅
Bro lose to drake did you catch the bars at the beginning? “U, N, O” like the game “Uno”.  Them boys talking like they want “ All fists” or “Offense” or “Office” you better be talking bout Cubicles that was a triple he did all that in like 10 seconds no way after that you think drake will out rap him 💯but to be fair drake is the overall goat not bars wise but longevity and hits. Also Goats don’t make Goats so they team not crazy. Ok so after that last drake verse drake might have won
Drake is Ronaldo. Jcole us messi
Messi
Nuevo subs bro , un abrazo desde México karnal 🔥❤️
Ma man shaq took errtin personal 😤
This music video cost more to produce than most hollywood movies for real bro. Shit was CRAZY
Drake about to drop his 10th! Scary Hours unless it’s dropped as something else but we are spoilt
If Drake and Cole are Ronaldo and Messi. What does that make Kendrick?
Yo what’s good shaq?, I think that score 79-69 is a reference to a song off the album called 7969 Santa
Tell me why when he paused it to look at stats, man had drake on pause looking like Andrew Tate in jail 😂 Time 5:35
1 second on the clock is crazy
This is definitely the best Music video right now
Yeah we gone need that YB album reaction ngl to you 💚
Drake out rapped that man though
Hell nah aint no ronaldo vs messi. Drake is Ronaldo and Messi. Who the hell is Cole??
drake sucks, ye better
MESSI, WINS.
WHY DIDN'T HE DO GOD DID HES TRIPPN
Shaq man when you gonna react to that new youngboy, come on now
MaNigga a judge of some sort and he biased asf😂
*every scene change*  Shaq "COLE YOU BETTER WIN NI**A"
This is the best music video I have seen this year no cap
Where The Kid LAROI the first time?
👍👍🔥🔥👍👍💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
If you didn't catch the MJ white socks and high trousers, then wow. The statue at the end is a reference to MJ statue for his history album. The video is epic, but Drake will NEVER be bigger than the king of pop. RIP #MJ this generation needs to go and do their research and look up MJ past music videos. He started it. The chess scene is a copy of the Ronaldo and Messi chess match poster.
This nigga talks like he got grills in his mouth , dope bra ……. Love the reaction though
React to Kid LAROI new album 🙏
The reference to the "Messi vs Ronaldo" rivalry was just something else. Those guys are undisputed GOATS for real.
They had to make Drake look like the winner at the end of the video because he got washed by Cole on his own track.
Bro Drake and Cole went crazy on this men I can't even lie the music video and the song is fucking crazy ❤
react trippie next pls

In terms of Soccer Drake is only a Karim Benzema when it comes to rap 😂, he ain't nowhere near Ronaldo or Messi level, Cole is the only one deserving, Meek is over Drake
Don’t disrespect Kevin like dat ! He a goat 🐐🔥
Youngboy drake cole one album

Manifesting 1M views on this reaction
Shaq didn’t analyse the hidden images in the song😞
Best song man but the year track is good too they need a video to 😁
"They act like 2 legends cannot coexist" - GREATEST VIDEO OF ALL TIME 🐐#GOATS🐐
This shit crazy. Got a movie level production
The way Drake looked at J. Cole when he mentioned YB. 😂😂
I think their position on that video should have been the other way round.   It  should have been contrary cause J. Cole is a better lyricist than Drake, Drake is more for the media just  like Cr7 while J. Cole is the most humble lyricist that ever exist just like Messi who is so humble so for me J. Cole sho be sitted on Messi side while Drake sits on the Ronaldo side because they all brag a lot while Messi and J. Cole don't.
Mane the animations, edits all that was tuff asf wtf
This was 🔥 love the video NLG family stay motivated Dream big 5 mill on the way let's get it dats Tuff
