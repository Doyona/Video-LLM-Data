Who is agree housefull 5 copy of this movie
나일江의 죽음.
Armie Hammer is sexy AF in this movie. His scenes alone make it worth watching.
Я готов без Эда буне Марвела
THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED
Nice Movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47aiiZnsqKA
Thinking about sitting down and watching this here shortly, is it worth it?
Nice?
Murder on the orient express
Believe me! I bet this movie didn't make any money at the box office at all. Besides alot of these movies that are based on books will be nothing but box office failure/Disappointment. All the film industries cares about is superhero movies.😒
Y el desnudo de Gal Gadot?
I think they missed the essence of Poirot, he’s not an action hero! He uses his brain, he’s not a fan of gun actions
Very Thrilling movie.
Is it like detective Conan🤔🤔🤔
meh! needs a predator to spice things up :)
Who’s here for Emma Mackey? 😩😩
Good.
Of course they have to put the obligatory black person in it🙄
This is where Gilderoy Lockhart was during the first HP book
You can watch it with Cinemavariety
The first couple in the movie did it.
Spoilers: Armie Hammer ate the victim
Waste of money not worth it.
The husband looks like steven schapiro
Excellent movie!!! so different from the old one but great!  please do watch it on the big screen!
Armie hammer killed at the victims and ate them, others eventually died from inoculation of an experimental vaccine but Lelita Wright and Russell brand survived because they are anti vaxxxer Gal Gadot was asleep the whole time being as senseless as she is. The end.
Enjoyed this film very much.
I have investigated many murders, but this one altered the shape of my soul. Im detective Hercule Poirot, and I will deliver your Killer.   Such powerfull lines
Just watched it. A great movie, however the cast wasn't as strong as before, whereas the storyline was far superior.
I noticed in the movie he mentions retiring, moving to a cottage and growing marrows...could the next movie then be The Murder of Roger  Ackroyd? 🤔 And if Poirot is going to become romantically involved with someone, surely it should be Ariadne Oliver....
sherlock = brett, poirot = suchet. other actors are unacceptable :)
Armie is the killer.The preppie dude was the killer like in the  book and 1978 film NO SURPRISE
I prefer this trailer to the newer one, which tries to minimize Armie Hammer’s role in the film.
This Movie Like "Murdar In Oriand Expres, Superhit Film
The casting of Armie Hammer and all the changes from the book ruined it for me..
Ada lidya diantaranya 😂👍
Bad movie
Looked promising. However the reviews are brutal. Critics unanimously say it's a stinker. What a shame.
Ummm AH on this film? Really? 👁👄👁 A little too close to home neh? 👀 🙆🏾‍♀️
Love these kinds of films. 🕵🏽‍♂️
Amazing !!
im sorry, was that jennifer saunders? cause this film could be about fkn trump n id still it for that woman
Worst version of Poirot. Almost makes me want to skip the actual movies, especially since I have seen every other version of this film and series.
I still love this trailer!
David Suchet is still king
Armie Hammer... ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
The newest trailer makes it look like Arnie Hammer isn't even in the film.
The music, the book and Egypt..❤
Music is from the best bend ever  - Depeche Mode, song Policy of Truth 🖤🌹
Don't you get tired of watching people kill each other?
when i saw the thumbnail: "oh no he's eating her!!!"
The movie is Among Us
Ze qwaiym Iz meurdhur
Exactly!
Ali Faisal ❤️
I am here only for Ali Fazal🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥
Ali fazal also known as Guddu bhaiya
A Hercule Poirot film without David Suchet as Poirot!  That doesn't seem alright.
Armie hammer is the bad guy
Poor graphics real pics from the Nile Valley would have been awesome
Maeve wiley
been waiting for this one the orient was very good, excellent cast and Branagh lives up to the actor David sachet.
Perfect, Christie with a touch of depeche mode 💜
Whoa! They waited e whole year to release this just to edit the movie in a way that makes Armie Hammer look insignificant!
What I don't understand is why they had to change some characters' names.  Where is Mr. Pennington? Is this movie going to be closer to the book than the one with Peter Ustinov where they left out or merged characters?
I love gal gadot
1:04
Very happy to see Rose Leslie in movie again after she gave life to her newborn son.
Man...Dave Gahan's voice gives me the chills.  This song is SO awesome!!!  Love Depeche Mode!!!!
I am 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗿𝗼𝘁, and I will deliver your killer.
CGI looks horrendous 😳
Trailers everywhere but where can I actually watch it??
They tried so hard to edit Armie Hammer out of the trailer. I've never seen the back of someones head that much in one trailer 😂😂😂😂
Never read the book but my GF did and she took me to go see the previous movie and praise the actor that plays the detective and loved the movie! Definitely gonna be watching it and this time taking my GF this time lol

Can’t wait. Looks very intriguing
where'd y'all buy the book from? I can't find it , anyone please
Is this Murder on the orient express remake or sequel????
Everybody is here for the book but I’m here because it’s my country 😎🇪🇬
When?
FINALLY MY WAIT IS NEARLY OVER!!!! This is one of my Agatha Christie's favorite book. I hope the next film are 'Josephine's Diary' and also 'AndThere Were None'.
Armie hammer! Te estamos esperando!!!!!💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓 Por fin!
I am here only for Agatha Christie, I love this woman and her books ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg😍😍😍😍😍
Ali fazl yay
Ali Fazal finally getting what he deserves ❤️
How know the title of the song at 01:29 please ?
Someone please change Hercule Poirot's moustache😒😒😒😭😭😭😭
watching this for maeve wiley.
Didn't realize French and Saunders were gonna be in this movie together. 😂
YESSS! Finally! For years my friends were telling me there was no chance of seeing the sequel and yet here we are! OH YEAH!
Hope its better than his terrible version of murder on the orient express.
Kenneth Branagh is not a single person. 😻
Louise Bourget is described as a "vivacious Latin brunette", and yet she is being played by a red headed, Scott.... Not to mention the casting of the Otterbourne mother and daughter. Just a ploy to be more PC.
Wanna hear Ali Faizal voice..
Me
I've seen the British tv series, and in this particularly story, Emily Blunt played the same role as Gal Gadot's. I must say, despite Gal Gadot's beauty, Emily Blunt looked absolutely stunning in that episode!
im sorry but how do you choose Gadot over Mackey
For those wondering I’d guess a new trailer for the hopefully-final release date will drop in time for either WEST SIDE STORY or THE KING’S MAN.
Delayed so long that Branagh made and released a new film in the interim
Favourite story with my favourite Emma Mackey💕
The description will now change the release date to February 11, 2022, plus a new trailer should drop soon...
Who else forgot about this movie because they pushed it back so many times?
Anyone else here cus of maeve Wiley ( Emma Mackey)
Can't wait!
Nobody compares to David Suchet
Is this movie ever going to be released?
I’ve really wanted to see this but they have pushed the release date so many f***ing times in 2 1/2 tears. that is why I’ve decided to boycott it.
I wish it came out in October of last year.
Emma Mackey ! She's wonderful🥰
I'm here for Armie Hammer and i don't care for your opinion!
Forgot this was supposed to come out
It's funny because I just spent last week in a cruise on the Nile, and then today I see this. xD Recognized immediately Abu Simbel (the huge statues in the beginning), truly impressive stuff.
Somebody please, cancel this film Armie Hammer doesn't deserve a comeback.
Hopefully Armie Hammer gave out a great performance so that he gets his life back in shape.
I happen to be here because of RUSSELL BRAND, "MOTHERFUCKERS" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely loved the books, simply amazing. Thank you Agatha for producing such wonders. I am SO glad we get to see them on the big screen. Murder on the Orient Express was an amazing movie and I could not wait for a sequel! Thank you for this trailer and keeping our Mystery Thirst quenched just a little bit till the movie comes out.
I love christie's book, can't wait for the movie
looks dope AF
the song choices so far on these movie -_-
I'm here for Emma Mackey. What a goddess.
Did this ever come out?
"Ze romance of ze dessert...ze soufflé, ze crème anglaise, les petits fourds..." "Poirot, I think you're going off-script. We're in the desert, not eating dessert." "Zut alors! I am deestracted by zees outrageous accent!"
Cet accent putain 😂
So, this film is scheduled to be released on 11th Feb 2022.  Can't see it being more than a token release to satisfy people's contractual obligations.
Just for Ali Fazal ❣️❣️
Armie Hammer is the cannibal.
emma mackey ily
i loved murder on the orient express how come i didn’t know this trailer came out LAST YEAR. i thought this was new. now the movie is coming out NEXT YEAR.
i forget emma mackey is not actually an 18 year old moordale student sometimes.
Well the trailer wasn't worthy at all, did anyone watch the movie? recommended??
Shinichi joined the group
LOVE YOU AGATHA CHRISTIE I LOVE YOU POIROT!!!!
Here for Maeve Wiley 😍
Anyone else wondering what happened to this movie? Haven’t heard or seen anything about it since the trailer dropped.
I’m only excited for this movie for Emma Mackey
😍😍♥🔥
I'm here cos of Emma
Words cant describe how hyped I am for this movie, hope its as good as murder on the Orient express
Depeche Mode🔊
I love the book and Emma, this makes me excited!!
Maeve looks different here
emma mackey and letitia wright look stunning here! <3
0:01 what the f...k
Hey Maeve 👋
David Suchet wld always be my favourite Hercule Poirot. He captured Agatha Christie's Poirot so well. He was effortless!!!!!!
Yay. Maeve is on it
When is this releasing??
0:17 maeve or Harley Quinn I am confused 😳😁
So good to see Emma Mackey and Ali Fazal 🔥🥶
So this movie really is never seeing the light of day thanks to Armie Hammer huh? 😭
so glad Emma is making it!!!
This all looks great except for the hideous face of an actual war criminal
is chesse in the logo
Omg Ali Fazal!!!!! And Emma Mackey is straight off stealing the show - how Brilliant!!!!
It was Armie Hammer. 100%
which october?
What is the next book thay are going to do? I belive it is the ABC murder. I Also like to see someone do a big budget miss marple movie, who do you think Will play her in that?
Hercule Poirot does not look like that 😐😥😫
So murder on the orient steam boat?
Ali fazal making India proud❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait to see this version of the classic Poirot case.
cinema is back!!!! after all these netflix and disney+ shits during quarantine,  cinema is now coming back!!
WHEN IS THIS COMINGGGGGG SOMEONEEEE TELLLL MEEEEE
Well, they're going to have to deepfake this before release right?
I'll pay to watch just for the Mustache.
The cast, the cinematography, the original material. Everything is stellar, but it can’t compete anyway with a subtle genius of production with David Suchet as Hercule.
Honestly, homies, I like my Poirot chubby and short.
غازي عبد الرحمن القصيبي “سنوات المراهقه في حياة كل انسان (وانسانه) هي سنوات ضائعه لا معنى لها مسروقة من الطفولة والرجولة معا.”
Loved the '78 movie with Peter Ustinov.
This movie is jam packed with 21st century Hollywood's greatest! Of course, starting with Armie Hammer, the cannibal rapist and Letitia Wright, the internet detective religious anti vaxxerz ✊🏼💅🏻 Purrr to the producers.
Unfortunately I don’t think this will hold a candle to the David Suchet versions
Wonder Woman 1934 looks great.
Can we make the other agatha christie mysteries than remaking already made films??
Spoiler Alert:Simon Doyle did it  Mwahhaaaaa hahaha hahaha
I want this movie PLEASE THIS WAIT IS KILLING ME
I just finished the book last night. And the ending blew my mind. I love murder mysteries and this one is among the best I have ever read. I can't wait to see it on screen with such an amazing cast.
When is this releasing?
Looks great and loved the Depeche Mode soundtrack, would never thought of them for an Hercule Poirot movie. 😀
Agatha Christie's  Is really awesome    Her every crime story is awesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yiggrte and job snow spotted
Gal gadot ! Emma Mackey !  Ali Fazal ! Letitia wright ! I' m screaming
It looks good, but how excited can you get when YOU KNOW WHO DONE IT?
Finally.
I want to watch this
Gal Gadot will be Victim.. 💯
"Altered the shape of my soul"? What does that even mean?
This movie could be more exciting unless it doesn't contains the same twist in murder on the Orient express..
Murder on the Orient Express's twist that *EvErYoNe Is ThE mUrDeReR aNd FoR sOmE rEaSoN iM jUsT lEtTiNg YoU gO!* was kinda stupid tbh. The movie was overall was alright. It was a decent 6/10 for me. This sequel looks much better. Hopefully the twist isn't as stupid as last time.
I am here for Ali Faisal
What is this for heaven's sake?! Absolutely awful.What a waste of money.
I love Gal Gadot. But it’s so hard for me not to imagine Linnet blonde
This is such a boring moved Said no one ever
Depeche Mode AND Agatha Christie?? Kenneth Branagh you are a genius, this must be the Real Deal! Is it October yet, pleaaaaase??
I love this book so much, can't believe I'm gonna have to watch Armie Hammer as Simon.
Omg this cast is full of cancelled people 💀
Gal is in mid 30s, but she loos like start of 40s. She doesn't age well.
naisssSsss
Castor oil
I'm so pumped for this movie! The book was one of my favourites, the suspense and thrill was unmatched! Even though I know the killer and everything, I'll still watch it.
Are isme to mirzapur wala guddu pandit hai 😳😳
I really Loved Murder Mysteries Movies I needed More!!!
The killer is always the 2nd or 3rd person shown in the movie. Always!
My man Ali Fazal rockin it once again
This looks amazing
I just love 10 Little Indians crime setups!
Music choice , casting choice, sets...everything 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Lol I don't know about this Movie 🍿
Emma Mickey ,Gal gadot, Ali Fasal  this is 💥🔥
Hi emma
Joy lobo has gone so far...🤘
Indian man should stop working in the Hollywood. Guy like Ali fazal got such a low time on the screen in the movie. Even his looks were destroyed completely in the movie. He looks better than the main hero in the movie.  This is b.s of Hollywood with Indian man.
Who else read the book recently then jumped to the trailer?
Jesus this looks terrible.
A cannibal and a zionist, what an incredible cast!
CANT WAITTTT
What surprises me is that T'challa's sister is acting in this movie.......
Gal Gadot is playing the role of charming, rich and beautiful Linnet Doyle. Such a bad cast. Ewwww
RELEASE THE FILM RN
C'mon when will you release this??
Ali Fazal 🥺🥺❤️❤️
"I am detective Hercule Poirot, and I will deliver your killer."
The press for this movie is gonna be awkward
this movie isnt even out yet and its already not aging well lmao
Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Emma Mckey, Letitia Wright..WTH this is a bomb star cast!!
Prediction: this movie will never be released.
I was just reading the book
Agatha Christie is the famous book writer book novels in history!
2022!
Who's here for Gal Gadot 😍....  So amazing
Kenneth Branagh is Laurence Olivier's reincarnation. No argument needed.
Emma mackey love
Finally a Depeche Mode Main track!!!!
ali fazal and emma are the only reason I will watch this movie
The bgm music is awesome Can anyone tell me the music name
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok  Back in October  I learned that Rose Leslie is going to be in this movie. And since I'm an Agatha Cristie fan I got ashamed that I haven't read the book yet. So I decided to read it before I watch the movie. Now it's my favorite book of all time and I swear to God that if this film isn't an accurate adaptation, I would like nothing more but to put a gun against my head and gently pull the trigger...
I'm so freaking glad he is still Hercule Poirot.
What the heck is Mauve doing here? 😂
Another mess that is so far from what Mrs Christie I wouldn't be surprised if the estate sues the screen writers.   I am assuming the is Ken Branagh's production, it is deeply unworthy of him.
Gal Gadot, Emma Mackey, Ali Fazal😭 Oh my Allah 😩 this gonna be a banger 😍
Get it...Sea of Truth? Cause they're on a boat!?   Oh wait, but the Nile is a river.
I just finished the book! Great ending! Let's see if the movie delivers!
only for Maeve
When is this movie gonna be released?
Wonder how this film is gonna deal with the Armie Hammer situation
Who is here for ali faizal☺🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
whats the point of these remakes? everyone knows the story, what happened , how it happened, and if you want the best version, go watch the Peter Ustinov version. all that said, i'll still watch it...hahaha
Now this is a trailer!!!
The killer is Armie, he ate every single one of them
i can see the hunger (for human flesh) in Armies eyes lmfaoo
I love his accent
And then there was 1
I'm here for Depeche Mode tbh
Spoilers! Tell you what, if Armie Hammer is the killer, as well he should be, the casting was perfect and there's no reason to have him reshot.
That swine Linnet. I didn't feel even an ounce of pity or sorry for her.
December 2019 >  october 2020 >  december 2020 >  september 2021 >  FEBRUARY 2022!!!  Just release it on Disney +
Sound’s like the movie will never come out
Finally after 4 years of waiting
Still salty that they didn't use David Suchet to reprise his roll as Hercule Poriot...he said that he would😒
Fab can't wait
Hollywood version of Detective Conan
im gonna watch this just for emma, but that armie man has to go. replace him or its going to get real down..
Yikes, Armie Hammer in one of the lead roles, that's gonna be a absolute expensive nightmare to figure out what to do about that
Simon and Jackie are the two murderers. Thank me later
Ali Faizal is also in the movie yay!!!
so we have to wait for a year for the release?
Shuri with wonder woman
they all killed him
Maeve with guddu bhaiya❤️
Basically, all of them?
Is it Emma Mackey or Lucy Hale or Margot Robbie.  It's  hard to guess.
So...are we thinking Armie Hammer reshoot ala Chris Plummer/Kevin Spacey switcheroo? I elect Henry Cavill.
Armie Hammer, Gal Gadot, Emma Mackey and Kenneth Branagh and more. The movies is going to be superhit
I've just finished reading this amazing book. I'm missing Cornelia, the Allertons and I think it's not gonna have Race's plot in this, since it seems he was substituted by Bouc in this one. I really liked all the plots regarding these characters (and some others) and it contributed a lot for the mystery. Still looking forward to watch this version, though!
Bouc from orient express is also there
Nothing beats the thrill you get on turning the next page on the book, no matter how pomp and showy Hollywood gets. Christie's magic is in her words.
The song that is playing in background is the best. That is policy of truth. Anyone here who liked the song
Came here from the book! Where to watch this by the way?
Was is Armie hammer? 😂
Everyone who has read the book knows the meaning of every scene 😍
Emma Mackey fans like here❤️
Hope they are working on the Parker Pyne Collection version for the movie script, although the trailers advises it is Poirot who is the Detective. The  Hercule Poirot version has already been EXTENSIVELY exploited already.
where can we find this online to watch?
"I am detective Hercule Poirot. And I will deliver your Killer"   The French accent killed it!
0:37 ali fajal❤️
Ok but nobody can argue that david suchet was the best poirot
0:39 u see Eminem? He's the one with the White shirt....
He isn't Ali Fazal! That's Riz Ahmed!
I'm really looking forward to this !
Um when is this movie coming out?!?
Hoping they still release this with Armie in it 😅
Woahhhhh i looks sooo good😍 I hope i found it online somewhere
0:00 Nobody: TCF logo: * S T U D I O S *
I watch this everyday. Hyped for the release. Reading the book. It amazing. Like for good wishes for u and ur family
When is the movie comming ?
Branagh's moustache... overacting as usual.
Depeche Mode and Poirot? No thanks!
I legit can't find this film anywhere
I know who is killer
Emma Mackey❤️❤️
Could someone close to Kenneth Branagh please tell him that he always sounds ridiculous doing accents. Not as bad as Steve Martin, but it pulls me right out of the film
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbaTDG6RG5_jfqRYSa-PcsL_k_-gnHeF6
I didn't know that Margot Robbie had a twin?!
Looks as stupid as Gal Gadot singing "Imagine."
Ali Fazal
Is this the sequel of murder on orient express?
As hercule I can see the world as it should be, and unfortunately Gal gadot, armie hammer, don't fit in this movie. Russell brand is to be found out, need more screentime, the actors are too mainstream, armie and gadots appearance and demeanor just don't fit in this sort of theme. What Gadot brings to this movie is bad, it's almost as if its a comedy movie when you see her,  put her in marvel movies, but keep her out of this type of movie.  I found the orientexpress wholesome, mystery and a good atmosphere.   Don't get me wrong I like gadot but for this movie she's an annoyance that makes me unable to enjoy it. Same with armie hammer. Also emma over gadot.  This was bad casting by the casting director, and people should know that too.   Kenneth is a great actor, and should be the only one shining in this movie, the hercule poirot character leaves most actors in the dust, the actor is amazing, the look - It rivals even the most esteemed of actors, just that character persona.  Not saying gal is ruining the movie by overshining, she could never, this is kenneth show, but she's too much of an inconsistensy in the poirot universe.  For example, johnny depp's appeerance in the orientexpress was little, even though he's a titan actor, he never outdid kenneth. And the character actually fit the setting, a little makeup here, and there, sure we could still see it was johnny but it worked.  Gal gadot, as gal gadot do not work, again she's too gadot, too new, too ... (Yolo) for the movie.
was this movie even released?
I really want this Policy of Truth remix.
I came here for the 10 seconds of Gal Gadot.
No doubt Kenneth Branagh has re-written the story to "improve" Agatha Christie's intricate plot, just as he did with "Orient Express."  No doubt another big, fat, dismal turkey, just like "Orient Express."  Why re-make good movies?  Why not re-make lousy ones with the germ of a good idea and try to improve them?  I suppose that would require thought and some actual creativity.  *Sigh*
and now the release date is September 17, 2021
Aaaaaahhhhh! Oh my gosh! The book is the best by far, and the original movie was really, really good. I am so excited about seeing this new Poirot in a second Christie film!!!! He did the original 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express justice in his own Poirot 2017 version so I have very high hopes for this updated version of Nile.
More crap. Wasn’t orient express enough?
In theaters this February 11, 2022
Have read the book but still want to watch this
How can we watch this movie?  I can't find it anywhere!!!
reminds me of that train one
Is this the sequel of murder on the orient express?
Where can I watch this?  Will it be in theaters??
Yeah just went to your movie theater last weekend it was great got to take my dad who's 75 years old out where he hasn't been out of the house for 8 months why have you guys decided to close for the season when you're the only movie theater in town we can go seemy dad's going to be very disappointed to hear this for a really was looking forward to going to the movie theater every weekend please open back up
DEPECHE MODE and ARMIE HAMMER in one video?? I'm living!
gal gadot a zionist soldier and a killer don't let her beauty make you forget that
in india ali fazal remains underrated. i m happy talented people like him and priyanka chopra are making it to hollywood .
But was it good
Are this is sekuel of Murder of orient express
Watching this trailer while watching the 1978 movie. That one is a classic and this would have to be extremely good to top it.
I just Now Discover that this is A Sequel from Murder on Orient Express.
I love You Emma Mackey ❤️❤️
No David Suchet no thanks
Iam only here for ali faizal ( guddu bhaiyya )❤️
I am here for  1. Armie hammer 2. Gal gadot  3. Emma mackey 4. Ali Fazal 5. Shuri( Black panther)  That's my order. Y'll can make your own.
Just finished reading the book! Excited for the movie!
Ali Fazal ❤️❤️🤩
Guddu pandit guddu pandit
Read the book.  It's amazing.
remake of the 1978 movie
Tomara que seja igual ao livro 😍😍
Came here after finishing the book and I have to say, the ending was very over the top and almost ridiculous. Interesting to see how they will pull it off in the movie...
Armie Hammer's ugly.
so, they postpone the release date (again)? lmao
Is French & Saunders playing Bette & Maggie? Is Annette B playing Angela? Those were the fun parts.
Armie and gal 😭♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Who's here for ali Fazal aka Guddu bhaiya
💟💟💟  melhor filme
0:36 GUDDU BHAIYYA :)

Jules Maigret > Hercule Poirot > Sherlock Holmes. Change my mind.
Guddu bhaiya ki itto badi success hogi yeh
guddu bhaiya!!!!!!!!
Who saw Maeve Wiley here?
Guddu bhaiya rocks
Who is here only because of Ali Fazal after watching MS2???
Ali Fazal on fire
1:13 : French and Saunders.

Guddu baiya ku mirzapur de dho..woh he killer pakka

Guddu Pandit.. Yaad rakhiyega
Wow...they fucked up Hercule Poirot 😂
Will there be a movie where Hercule Poirot meets Sherlock Holmes? 🤔
I thought it's Margot Robbie
I'm soooooo excited
Ali fazal from Mirzapur!!!
Hercule Poirot = David Suchet
Hands down my favorite Agatha Christie story.
Nobody wants to see Gal Gadot
0:28 is that you Russell???

AMONG US ON CRUISE
lame
It's hard to beat David Suchet as Poirot.
The trailer basically tells the whole story for those who have read the book
So where can I watch it?
Awesome song choice ❤, is this still coming out though???
0:00 to 0:02 That’s Disgusting!
This is a great trailer.
I can't wait.
I will watch this film , definitely .  Ali fazal bhai 😎
Guddu Bhaiya Meets Wonder Woman and why is Maeve joining them ?? 😂😂😂
ehh doesn't hold up to the TV series with David Suchet, including the extended cast. Emily Blunt as Linnet Doyle was awesome.
Blitz//Berlin's remix of Policy of Truth turns 80's synth into 20's intrigue.
Trailer for this nowhere as awesome as the teaser trailer for the first one
This movie is good and this song is non-stop
Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, David Suchet. In the words of Miranda Priestly..."That's all".
Ho ho ho. 0_0
Hercule Poirot is a great character especially with Branagh hes brilliant
Ali fazal  😍😍😍😍
I am confused it says October 23rd but on Google it says December which is it?
Depeche Mode "Policy Of Truth" CINEMATIC REMIX by Slvr Scrns  https://youtu.be/cbBUTXXFBc8
Ali fazal and emma mackey is lit
They said that it would be coming on the 23 of October. Now it says 18 of December. Choose the date nicely.
Being the first one here knowing Rose Leslie is having a baby with Kit Harrington! 💘
I'd love to see Captain Hastings in one of Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot movie
Nobody can beat Knives out, only knives out can honor agatha christie
Music?
Let me guess, Wonder Woman is the villain.
In the first one, nobody felt like they were a Murderer. This one, "I don't feel safe with any of them."
Comes out the same day as DUNE
la traduction c'est en option chez century studios ...  stupide  ...... pfff
I am here for Emma Mackey
Well Gal Gadot will be killed by Armie Hammer!!!
Sorry but I don't understand why people are saying that this looks good (I tried), please go watch the 1978 movie and read the book
How does anyone agree to play Poirot after David Suchet?
who is here only for ali fazal
Poor, third rate remake of a great book.
this trailer is so sensational i thought i am watching animation not poirot , if you watched the poirot that played by david suchet you will never watch this .
2 movies, still dont know what the detectives name is
This looks great
Who is only come here to see Ali fazal (Guddu Bhaiya ) Mee to Hit like
Who’s the killer?
When release ?
Love this version of 🎶Policy of Truth🎶 80s❤️
I have watched 80s trailer is this a remake of it?
Bring back DAVID SUCHET!!! He is a true Hercule Poirot!
Policy of Truth is all I am here for.
Doesn't look like it was filmed in Egypt, looks entirely studio based...Was there any need for Russell Brand to be in this? Ugh I can't stand him! I think I will stick with the David Suchet version!
I don't know why I watch trailers of some guy who is NOT Hercule Poirot...
1:13 French & Saunders are back😂👌❤️

The full version of Policy of Truth DotN version is going to be good when it comes out.
Greatly enjoyed the Orient Express, and have been looking forward to this for two years. Gimme gimme gimme!
LOOKS BETTER THAN ORIENT EXPRESS!
I just got done watching Murder on the Orient Express and it was so good .  At the end the British Army Messenger asks  him to solve the Nile case. This is that story
Oh hell to the YES!
Who else is here now that Wonder Woman got delayed so this is the next big movie coming out this year after Tenet?
Hercule Poirot is back!!! can't wait to see
This was always my favourite episode and i am so exited for this!,
Among Us in real life

Best wishes for ali faizal apne (guddu bhaiya) rock 🤘👍kr denge movie💗🔥🔥
Does anyone know what remix of Depeche Mode ‘Policy of Truth’ this is?
Hamre guddu bhaiya wonder woman ke sath😃 Sirf guddu bhaiya ke liye dekhenge film
but who will play Joanna?
Christie and armie hammer? I'm in!!!
Kenneth Branagh is amazing.
Was a childhood fave so hoping this actually works and we get more quality remakes. I need an updated feature length endless night.
Who's here actually because of the book? Absolutely love Agatha Christie!
LOL. Pathetic, the film from the 70's had bigger star power.
Murder on the Orient was in 3D when it came out a few years ago.  Is this also in 3D?
Nice
I remember getting my brain blown out when I finished reading the book, I love Agatha Christie, its evergreen. Hoping this movie delivers.
The most shocking thing in this trailer was Russell Brand lol, from one guy to another he looks good in this 💀
Song name
Excuse Me!? *The* Gal Gadot, *Wonder woman* herself doesn't feel safe with any of them? So hard to picture😂
This looks fantastic!!!!!!!!!!
IM SOVFCKIN EXCITED
i'm so tired of movies about white people coming to africa. gives strong colonizer vibes.
Would you mind to like our trailer reaction? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhFyy5J_59A Thank you very much, you all!
I am so hype!!!!! As a Guy how watch the series.
depeche!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I couldn't recognize Russell in this, but is that Aldous Snow singing?
carry minati new video -https://youtu.be/toEmALecLR4
I must say, the mustache is not big enough.
Emma McKay is perfect as Jacqueline 😻
What kind of accent that Poirot speaks? It feels like French but a little bit different
Why tf did I play thr pc game 😭😭
I’m sorry can you guys just name your studios just 20th Century
Hamari bhi video dek liya kro hamara koi Bollywood mein grandfather Nahi Hai 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇 https://youtu.be/K5OwUVvKQ3I
Is it going to release on OTT platform? They better not release it in theatres.
Egypt ❤️❤️
https://youtu.be/HPdqEZbZDtQ amazing Borneo Indonesia hallo friends 🙏
I love hollywood romantic movies who support me😘😘😘😘😘
#1 hollywood movies are best 😘😘
How many people are fan of Hollywood movies as me 👇
The Big Mustache has returned. Solving crimes an eating sweets while doing it.
Christie fucks your mind with this one. It's no jealousy but money🌚
The production designing looks way too stunning. Very different from the book. I miss the egg-shaped head and the peculiarity of my Poirot🙈 Fazal's gorgeous as usual🔥
Jodie Comer was likely supposed to play Jacqueline De Bellefort I'm crying. Emma Mackey is talented too
Guys, will this be a good one?
Release the Depeche Mode’s remix song.
Ghar ki Murghi Daal barabar #AliFazal
I was born in the wrong era
How do you release an official trailer but not bother with closed captioning? :(
Why I don't see Agatha Christie name anywhere in this trailer
Pardesi My Guys
MY FAVORITE BOOK IM SO EXCITED
Sushant was planning to move Hollywood, wish he cud have done it. He wud be much more successful n respected over there. More than ali faisal. Bastards killed him.
Ali fazal ♥️
Gussa bhaiya har jagah bhau kal macha rahe hai 😂
Mirzapur 2 and this movie releases on the same date 🤩
I didn't even try to figure out...I just 100% believed it was Margot Robbie... then I saw the cast list and realised it was Emma Mackey... wow...
Meanwhile Ali Fazal: Shuru Majboori Mein Kiye The Ab Hollywood Mein Majaa Aa Raha Hain 😄😆😄
Ali Fazal
I have admired Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot for many years. This trailer is awesome.  Although Gal gadot, and other actors appreared in the beginning, (while poirot narrates). I got goosebumped only when Poirot appears in the last seconds of trailer. Thats the power of HERCULE POIROT
I want a Knives Out sequel.
Oooohhh Is very cool
P
Kenneth Branagh looks slightly silly as Poirot and Orient Express was only so-so but Christie always captures my attention! In the meantime, for people who can't wait, check out Knives Out (not Christie but very good), And Then There Were None (BBC series with Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister)), and Crooked House (with Glenn Close). Happy watching!
One more like for Sushant Singh Rajput 🙏🙏
I am thrilled I love Agatha Christie and I liked the first one with Kevin Branagh Great cast .
This is called real talent💯
Can't wait!!!
Kenneth Branagh was amazing in "Murder on the Orient express". I will watch this one for him 😎🙂
Come on, we all know, no matter how hard they try, there is only one Poirot, David Suchet.
Kon kon 7 baje ⌚ baad dekhraha hai like kare 👇👇😂😂 I am a Small YouTuber  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC89KqKZBYvpKXwSaeOmHfTw
When I first saw the cast I thought it was an upcoming DC movie anyways this reminds me of Murder Mystery (starring Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston) but the serious version. lol
kyaaa no sabia que iban hacer otra de Poirot! y uno de sus mejores casos. genial!!
Bollywood's underrated actor Ali Fazal in this movie 👍👍👍
Nobody  Note a single player nothing my smile
Gal Gadot 😍 and Depeche Mode?  Top Duo in trailer for me 🔝

I ask you!Have you ever loved so much, been so possessed by jealousy, that you might kill? ❤️🎞️🎥
*Gal Gadot?! Armie Hammer?! Emma Mackey?! Yes. Yes and yes.* 😱😭
As an Indian i feel proud for Ali Fazal
Ali Fazal 😮😮
You can point out that the victim is Gal Gadot after watching the trailer closely.
Who all came here just to see Ali Fazal 😻🤚

Really excited ... waiting for the movie.

I love how predictable the ending was in the novel,but the writer was able to make it more complicated
Only for ali fazal panji k liye

This looks more like a horror movie than a murder mystery.
Ali Fazal 💯

Kenneth Branagh has the incredible talent for making wonderfully bad movies.
I like the Murder on the orient express, this will most definitely be enjoyable as well
Who is here because of Depeche Mode???
Ali Faizal : Suru Majboori mein kiye the, ab maza aa raha hn
Make some noise for ALI FAZAL - the legend
Who thinks Ali fazal is the murder??
I liked this trailer for Ali Fazal ONLY
F god!!!!!! This cast is something
I just hope Ali Fazal is not the first one to get killed..
Title of the Movie 👌 👌
October 23rd is Ali Fazal's day🙌🔥
Proud of ali Fazal ❤️ coming from no where to reach to this level
I'm not so excited for this one like I was the first one. Also I think the music for the trailer is awful and out of place,
Only for Guudu bhaiya
I'm watching this for Emma Mackey
I'm only for Gal Gadot 💗

Oh no ! Seriously ?? If you saw 1978 original movie.... you know who done it !! SPOILER ALERT !!!..... Naah, not gonna tell you. And like this one.... 1978 movie had brilliant cast...... LEGENDS..... Bette Davis , Mia Farrow, Peter Ustinov, Angela Lansbury,  Maggie Smith, George Kennedy , Jane Birkin , etc. .... So because I know the story and the end .... not going to see it.  This movie is for people who doesn't know ..... and trust me..... you would never guessed !! Enjoy.
What the song in the trailer anyone know?

I didn't know this was a sequel to the murder on the Orient Express .

Ali Fazal OP
Why ali fazal got so short duration in trailer
Gal Gadot!!! 😍❤️❤️❤️
Ali fazal we are Proud of you man❤ that's a  real talanet which Bollywood doesn't support 😤
In the first shot i thought she is Lucy Hale then i thought she is Margot Robbie then i understood  she is Emma Mackey.
I am a simple man .. I see a bad trailer with a bad actress ( Gadot ) I dislike.
Ali Fazal 😍❤
Bhaiya me Bhaiya guddu bhaiyaa jindaa baad..  Love u Ali Bhai
I came here for that 1sec... Love u Ali bhai
Ali Faizal is making India proud...such a great actor.😍
Guddu bhaiya... Ali Fazal  we are crazy waiting for Mirzapur
Hercule Poirot is probably the killer.
Sorry Kenneth but there will only be one Poirot and that is David Suchet
I wish they had asked David suchet to play Poirot....k honestly miss that twinkling eyes and voice
Ali fazal😍
What a coincidence 😂 On 23rd October mirzapur releasing too
No offence or hate intent but check out Lois Chiles as Linnet.I love Gal but Lois' outfits and jewelry are by far more gorgeous and opulent.I hope I am just mislead by the trailer.
Firstly being an Indian am very much proud to see Ali Faizal shining ❤ And secondly there Come Gal Gadot and the story by Agatha Christie..am very much looking forward to it❤
Thums up for Ali Fazal akka guddu bhaiya 🙌🔥🇮🇳
Random French & Saunders appearance
Armie hammer has changed a lot
Well, since there are very few comments about this person, I want to say I CAME HERE FOR ARMIE HAMMER. 😄😍😜
Branaghs "Poirot" sounds like a russian assassin.. Bring back David Suchet.
WAITING♥️♥️
0:37 Guddu bhiyaa appp🇮🇳👌Ali faizal
They're bringing back Depeche Mode songs!!! <3 hahaha as far as I remembered Ghost in the shell soundtrack was also Depeche Mode. Who else love Depeche Mode here? I'm a big fan of them too!! :D

Hey meave wiley there is a like for u.... ❤
Wtf is this comment section (movie looks great).
Basically I came here to appreciate Ali Fazal but Armie hammer and Gal Gadot !so gorgeous!
Turning into an interesting series. Would love to see them go through various time periods and even the future.
I wonder why Tom Bateman is above everyone on the credits. When Kenneth Branagh is playing the most vital role as Poirot. Anyone can tell me? Thanks. Is he very famous in the UK? I only know him in Murder On The Orient Express.
Now I know why Mirzapur S2 release is postponed 🤔
I love gudu bhai... I am waiting for your web series ( mirzapur 2)
i will see this movie only because of ali faizal and i am waiting for mirzapur2 ......jai hind..
Ali bhaiii ma chod denge hollywood kii
Omg I'm reading the book right now. I didn't even know that they are made a movie. I can't wait to watch it so I can compare it to the movie.

When I read the title, why did I think that there would be Nile crocodiles involve? LOL
Ali fazal one of the best actors! ♥️♥️♥️
I love that Russell Brand is in it
The trailer does not even have Ali for more than 1 sec, this is not appreciate!
Bollywood star's talent is that they can touch their nose with their tongue  I hope stars like ali fazal can make a place in bollywood
Any Ali Faizal (Guddu Bhaiya) Fans here
ALI FAIZAL PERFORM ALWAYS GOODS ND FEEL. PROUD OUR COUNTRY  .WE RESPECT  THEIR WORK CARRY ON KEEP DOING  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Ali Fazal bhai dialogue sunao chacha wala❤️😂😂😂
How many of you notice GUDDU BHAIYA MIRZAPUR WALE
Too...many...quick...cuts. This trailer should come with an epileptic seizure like video games do. Geesh.
I saw Ygritte. Did you?
In order to equal the original 1978 film it would have needed REAL actor stars playing opposite K.B., like Jude Law, Meryl Streep, John Malkowich, Angelina Jolie, Klaus Maria Brandauer - and of course Maggie Smith returning as Mrs Van Schuyler!
I just came here to see ali faizal

SPOILERS IN: 3. 2.. 1... Rich heiress Linnet Doyle (played by Gal Gadot) is murdered by her newlywed husband Simon Doyle (played by Arnie Hammer) and their friend Jacqueline de Bellefort (played by Emma Mackey) in a plot to get Linnet's money, as Simon and Jacqueline still love one another. I just saved you the price of admission and a few hours of your precious time.

i’m sorry but the TV show was so good i just can’t get behind this 😭😭😭
Act like "Ali Faizal "👌  But india's waiting for u as Guddu bhaiya! #excited_for_MS2
At the end of Murder on the Orient Express, they tell him there’s been a situation on the Nile. This is that story.
Did they really drop a stone block in the temple? Is it the real temple?
Remember when Gal Gadot sang Imagine no Possessions with her multimillion sire friends from their villas? Disliked
Who here wants to hear Imagine Dragons in the next trailer for this? I think “Natural” would work perfect with and keep with the theme started with “Orient Express” first trailer.
Ali fazal good to see you  In this trailer  keep going #seafarerstales
Emma Mackey ❤️🙏
Guddu bhaiya 🔥🔥

A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit beside you"?  The girl Answered with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you!!  All the people in the library started staring at the boy and he was embarrassed.  After minutes the girl walked quietly to the guy's table and said to him I study psychology and I know what man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed,right?  The guy responded with a loud voice :$300 for one night That's too much!! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the guy whispered in her ears,  "I study law and I know how to make someone guilty....🤭   If you enjoy the comment plz do “savscribe”to my channel...., I know I had written wrong spelling and grammar 🤗 But YouTube don't allow promotion...

They did not put Ali Fazal"s name and newcomer Emma Mackey is one of the leads. Hollywood will never put Asian actors in lead except some. Brando where are you..they did not realise why he did not take Oscar
I can't wait to see this
I hope this is not ended up like the Orient Express one. Visually stunning yet turns out to be an egg.
Emma is going to be a great Jackie!
I'm likin it..😎

Who is here for Guddu bhaiya👍
Rian Johnson should have been in the director's seat for these films. I don't mind Branagh as Poirot though, I guess.
All many great stories are tragidies
Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack they used in this trailer??!!
Gal Gadot acting with an American accent is pure gold.
Hamare guddu bhaiya ki jai ho👌👌👌

Guddu bhaiya ,wonder woman and shuri . Teeno hai!
Ali fazal is also in movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Guddu bhaiya yahan
Guddu Bhaiyaa 😍
David Suchet's adaptation was the best adaptation of Hercule Poirot that I have ever seen! The Hercule Poirot movies such as this one and the Murder on the Orient Express take on a more dramatic interpretation unlike David Suchet's 2012 MOTOE which is more dark, sinister and sometimes I even felt the cold escape through the screen.
Only for Ali Fazal 🔥🔥🔥
Who else came here for Ali Faisal 🤩
Ali Faisal ❤️🔥  Hello Guddu bhaiya

This trailer was perfection!!!! Doesn’t give too much away (especially to those who don’t know the story or the final outcome). And they actual blend in the victim to make it appear they are in the same scenes where Hercule Poirot is interrogating the others.
Love from India!

Ali Fazal 😱💫
Trailer is looking good so far. We compared the new cast with the old cast: seems the old cast was a more star-studded ensemble....Peter Ustinov alone is a grandmaster of cinema,  then you add Angela Lansbury on top ....difficult to top that
Emma Mackey ❤  Ali Fazal ❤
Sounded like Zlatan Ibhrahimovic
October this year will end up killing this film.
https://youtu.be/_L2FZHY_Ufc
You had me at Depeche Mode. Policy of Truth.
Just here for Ali Fazal , what an actor... Wanna see him more

I was tryin to figure out difference between andriah jermaiah and gal gadot
Now we all knoe why Mirzapur 2 is being delayed. Hats off to Guddu bhaiya 🔥
Ali ❤️
Until the end of the trailer I kept thinking “is Armie Hammer the detective because he’s the only guy I’m seeing with a moustache oh wait there’s Kenneth Braunaugh “
I hope they will make this one better. I'm a bit disappointed in Murder on the Orient express, they adapted it so much from the novel and it's not as good as I expected.
Orient express part two
Branagh is completely wrong for the role. What were they thinking?
Ali faisal op
Are bhai guddu bhaiya
Back ground music
Ali Fazal ❤
May Ali faizal get enough screenplay
I just saw the thumbnail and title and said "Interesting...." and after 15 seconds thought "This feels like a movie you'd put Gal Gadot in." And then 20 seconds in Gal Gadot actually appeared. 🤣  And now after seeing the thumbnail again, I realized that its actually her in the thumbnail as well.

I m here because of Ali faizal after dislike of sadak 2😅
Hercule : cant i just have 1 vacation where no one gets killed?! I dont get paid enough for this.
വല്ലതും കഴിച്ചോ?
Looks like they change a bit on how the killer performs but I love the casting of Armie and Gal they really look like their characters  Anyone here read the book? Or the watched the 1978 film?
Guddu baiya is back 😂
Ali faizal OP guys!  Looks like he has a pivotal role .

Quite tickled to see French and Saunders reunited.
i love when poirot sits everyone down and shlts on everyone's life and also exposes the murderer lol i'm excited about this movie
But... but Wonder Woman... it’s just a handful of people on a boat. Surely you can handle it with a quick whip of truth? 😆
1:06 that's chandler bing
October 23. Aha yeah umm.. Good luck with that.
Ali fazal ❤️
0:35 What on earth are they thinking taking a boat like that on the Nile !?! It's got a built-in ramp for crocodiles to walk right up and eat them !
I swear to god if it’s a team murder, I’m gonna be pissed.
It is a matter of great pride that there is an Indian actor in this film
Diana could’ve just used her lasso 🤷🏻‍♀️

So this means disney making more money now out of fox original franchise murder on the orient express coollll disney really put their money on fox and using it wisely house of mouse growing day by day
What song
So excited for another Kenneth Branaugh / Agatha Christie adaptation!  He does such a spot-on Poirot, and I loved Murder on the Orient Express
His voice sounds like a bad dubbing of a foreign language film from the eighties.
Twentieth Century Studios: All right! Imagine Dragons for Express, Depeche Mode for Nile, let's throw in some Jackson 5 next for.....The ABC Murders!
Love you mackey👍👍❤️🎉 You're an amazing actress (actor).......but you're more amazing when you're with Otis 😂😂😎.
The best combination of Emma mackey and Ali Fazal Love these two the most ❤️❤️😂😂🎉🎉
I can't wait. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Wowwwwh gal gadot ali fazal emma mackey
Sorry but can't imagine anyone else then David Suchet as Hercule Poirot ☹️☹️
Looks aesthetic
Why making movie when there is not allowed to enter movie houses due to covid
Ali Faisal 😎❤️🔥🔥🔥
Why is there always a murder when Poirot is on vacation?
Came for Ali Faizal💖💖
For some reason,  this feels like great gasby
Good to see Ali fazal here!
Ali Fazal proud of you
Branagh's moustache over-acting as usual.
Ali fazal you make us proud with your acting 💥💥bola tha na maja ayega
Here for guddu bhaiya and after release I will review it 10/10 ❤️
How will Kenneth Branagh's mustache get out of this one??!?!
This trailer makes what was a straightforward parlor room whodunnit look like an erotic horror thriller.  Not everything has to be, in the words or Red Letter Media regarding the new Star Trek films, electrified for a new audience.  If they’re not going to adapt it properly, they should make their own original material.
Keeneth Brangah : After experiencing a murder on the Train, now I shall make it a point to catch the murderer on a Ship!
Guddu bhaiya ke liye like kro
I preferred this story over Murder on the Orient Express, looking forward to seeing it at home!
Everyone: talking about the plot or ideas of the film  Me:... iS tHaT DaWn FrEnCH??

Ali bhai ❤
Munna bhaiya ko dekha hai 😂
In the beginning, God created heaven and earth. The earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. God saw that the light was good and he divided the darkness from the light.  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was nothing made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. And the light shined in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.   There was a man sent from God to bear witness of that light. That true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. The true light came to his own and his own received him not, but to as many as would receive him, to them, gave he power to become the sons of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.  And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among men and they beheld the Word of life, that true bread which came down from heaven wherein lies everlasting life.  “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭8:12‬ ‭KJV‬
Ali Fazal Op in tha chat guys🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️
Good to see ALI FAIZAL  Fan from india
Yaar muje bhi singher bannaa he koi help kar do
The whole trailer I’d been trying to figure out, ‘Emma Mackey or Margot Robbie’?
@0:37 just .5 sec aaya. Nothing to celebrate. Just to attract Indian audience. No hate to anyone.
Awaited.... Murder in the oriented express was awesome....think this one also awesome.... specialy the detective expression....👌😍👌
Why Poirot without Hastings everytime??!
Ali Faizal🔥
Ali Faisal ♥️♥️💪💪💪
Relocate to Hudson....where is Sherlock?
Loving the use of a bit of Depeche! ❤️

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18
It would be great to watch more of Agatha Christie's detective stories being portrayed in movies like these.
3 beautiful women Gal Gadot 💛 Rose Leslie 💚 Letitia Wright 💜 This is going to be exciting!
Like for Maeve willey

Guddu Bhaiya 😘.

Ali faizal  🙌 N my love wonder woman 😍
People who are Saying *Ali Fazal* isn't an Important Character in Movie Just look the Casting Sequence at 1:35 or Wikipedia....His Character is even more Important than Gal Gadot and Emma Mackey... Screen time in Trailer doesn't show time in Movie...
Hi nice
Awesome story....waiting egarly... https://youtu.be/IBa4h2wgPXA
Depeche Mode - The Policy of Truth
To the person that's reading this:   You're very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine.  My dream is to have 1k. I been struggling to get there!!🤝🌹
Ali Fazal ❤
Guddu bhaiya
Hit like for Ali Fazal👍👍
I saw Ali Fazal, he is such a brilliant actor why he doesn't get films in bollywood. Looks clear Hollywood prefer talent over Nepotism
Humare guddu bhaiya jindabad..
Arrey, Guddu Bhaiya!!!
1:19  ❤ "but this altered the shape of my soul"
Восхитительно 🙏❤️

i am soo excited for this...i am a very huge fan of the murder on orient express🚂🔪🕵🏼‍♂️
20 the century studio is same like fox star studio😂🎉
Ali fazal 😍😍😘
Conclusion:- gal gadot was killer🙏
Give me a period drama set in Egypt and I’m in
Came to see gal gadot surprised by watching Ali Fazal
Depeche 👍👍👍👍👍
Why Ali Fazal so less screen time
@ali fazal is amazing 😉
Those who are praising Ali Fazal are idiots who don't know that he is one of the anti-nationals in India who is openly supporting Terrorists, Urban naxals and lot of aggressive  protestors of the country.... Ali Fazal is CURSE for India.......!!
Well this time I'm excited for Emma Mackey more than Gal Gadot. ❤️❤️
Look great, can't wait!
Who is Here For Ali fazal ❤
Ali fazal will be the culprit.
Its like Murder on Orient Express but water edition
Indians are here only for guddu bhaiyya(ali Fazal) ❤️❤️

Emma Mackey!
Guddu bhaiya...ali Faizal🔥🔥🔥🔥
Only here becoz of ali fazal.. ⚡ wonderful actor..🙌
What a terrible shame someone had the idea that another remake was necessary.The only good thing is the Belgian accent!!! It's hysterical 😂
Guddu bhaiya @ 0:37 "zyada g*nd na fulao be, maa ch*d dege tumari"..😂😂
https://youtu.be/hlPvWm0e6_Y
https://youtu.be/hlPvWm0e6_Y
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Did anyone see murder on the Orient express?
I can't wait to see the movie but why is the English accent of the voice-over so bad?
Guddu BHAIYA
Anyone here after kangna praises ali zafar
this is absolutaly pointless film no need for this because only real (and best) Hercule Poirot is David Suchet anything else is just wasting money
0:37 Abey ye to syd Mirzapur wale Gudu भईया है🤣😂
Guddu bhaiya 🤩🥳
Wonder Woman meets Shuri and Ygritte! Awesome!
I almost didn’t even recognize Russell Brand, he actually doesn’t look homeless now
At first it sounded like Zlatan Ibrahimović talking instead of Poirot
literally the 1% people who's reading..... may your parents live more than 100 years with good health
Only people who didn’t come from *Tiktok* are worthy of liking this
Guddu bhaiya 🤘
Ali fazal rocks🤟🤟🤟❤❤❤
Hercule Poirot and Bouc together again🤩🤩
Wow........  self made star Ali faizal 0:37
And I'm here thinking what happened to Margot Robbie's face!!
How many were here for Ali Fazal👍👍👍👍
Ali Fazal ❤❤❤
He's no Peter Ustinov, but Kenneth Brannagh is still fantastic as the most famous Belgian in the world... Loved Murder on the Orient Express, and am really looking forward to this.
Read that book and it was a masterpiece! This movie just looks like art and I can't wait!
0:37 guddu bhaiya❤️❤️
ALI FAZAL from Fast and furious to this He is climbing ladder of success good going 🙏🏻 making INDIA proud 🇮🇳
I enjoyed the first movie a lot I hope this one is also good.
Guddu Bhaiya 0:37sec.🤫
I’ve been waiting for this joint!
France conan
Look at the styles of trailer..its Copy from Bollywood movie ' saaho' .. American what you think
Great to see ali faizal. 😍
Literally the 1% people who's reading.... May your parents live more than 100 years with good health 💙💙😇
I literally thought gal gadot was Scarlett johnansson for a sec lol
Ali Fazal ❤️
Another movie about Egypt, but w/o any Egyptians in it. There are a lot of really good Egyptian actors that can play one of these roles, but they cast actors from India, Israel, England, France and America.
Cannot wait!
Aree gudduu bhaiya , ye kis line me aa gaye aap
#alifazal Is a Rockstar, Fabulous actor,. this would bring to the entire indian subcontinent! Love u #alifazal❤,u'r a great artist🎭
Felt like heavy cast anime trailer 🔥😂🙃
How you gonna have a movie with the Nile in the title and cast white leads. Booooooooo trash
does this version of depeche mode's policy of truth actually exist to acquire or was it made for the trailer?
When you begin to inquire into the whole movement of knowledge and see the limitations of knowledge, for knowledge is always the past and therefore; fragmentary. Is there a way of learning, which is not the constant accumulation of knowledge from which to act?
Ali fazal😊😊😊😊😊😊 Love from India
Spoiler: gal gadot is the *killer* . She wouldn't have taken up the role if it wasn't dominating.
Ali Faizal Our Indian Actor Is Making Our Country So Proud of Him.
https://youtu.be/C7vNIbQw4IY Must see video Duniya ke bht,ajeeb facts Mera channel h bht mehnat se video bnai h dekhoge puri aur plz like,share,subsribe Guys plz plz 1 baar dekhlo new channel bnaya h bht mehnat lgi h is video me
0:37  ALI FAIZAL HERE ❤💯⚡
Why can’t Hollywood make actual new movies like knives out and not remake old poirot stuff like the murder on the orient express. Knives out was great because it was a new story which took a bunch of old tropes and made it into something new and entertaining, and didn’t just put a new coat of 21st century paint on an old story without actually making the effort to create something new.
He's back
Time 0.38 I seen Ali faijal ...I am shocked ....u r a great career build in short time ... Best of luck for ur feature...keep doing Ali faijal... 😍🥰🥰
0:38 Guddu bhaiyya <3 🇮🇳
Guddy bhaiyya ko jyada screen time Nahi Diya to maa c**d dega tumhari😂
Moustache of that detective 😄😄
Russel Brand was an unexpected choice but I'm not mad honeslty, he looks good.
Best of luck Ali Fizal🇮🇳🤗

खुश हूं कि मुझे जलाके तुम हंसे तो सही...,  https://youtu.be/V_TsHOvt214
Ali fazel great actor
Ali Fazal Looks Spectacular....
I swear all pretty much all depeche mode songs have been used in trailers
00:36
Gal Gadot and Emma Mackey and wait Ali fazel ..... You can't ignore this comment if you're indian ❤️
I know this song is Depeche Mode - Policy of Truth, but what remix is it?!
All I see is Wonder Woman, Maeve Wiley and our own 0:37 Guddu Bhaiya ;)
What a cast... kinda sad no one is mentioning Dawn French! She’s pretty good you know!
Ali fazal😃👏👏👏
Guddu Bhaiya
Who is here only for Ali Fazal? Love him. Bollywood don't deserve him. He deserve many more. Proud of him. We really need actors like him.
Guddu  bhaiya in hollywood😁😁

Only 99.9% of people will probably not see this but for the .1% May God Bless you and cover you and your family🙏🏾❤️!
Finally trailers are coming, cinema has started again thank you
Arey Guddu Bhaiya ❣️
I loved the 1978 version after I read the book. I’m so excited for this!!!
Is that French and Saunders in there as well?!😱😱
Another indian actor making proud of  our nation. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
The fact that they used Depeche Mode's Policy of Truth in the trailer, is reason enough for me to see this movie. Looks very stylish and mysterious. Doesn't give away too much, yet I'm interested in seeing the film. Not to mention a top-notch cast as well. Kenneth Branaugh only works with the best in the business.
To those of us who have already read the novel😪😪
Boycott nepotism.
Justice ⚖ for SSR
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k future
Guddu bhaiya kai liyai like thoko
and the killer is everyone
French and Saunders together again, I'm in!

Just a bunch of superhero love struggle
Guddu bhaiya
Ali fazal💝💝💝💟💝💝💝💝🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩💝💝💝💝
The trailer seems like the movie Murder on the Orient Express. I hope it is different in the movie though.
It feels like Knives Out x Murder Mystery with a Lil more on the seriousness part..I mean the boat part is clearly parallel to murder mystery
Just wanna see the movie for versatily ali faizal 🥰♥️😍
I see Gal Gadot and I’m interested!
This book is amazing and this movie looks so good!!!
HERCULE POIROT  is back ....  He is the most English detective I have seen.... Even more than James Bond 007
Ali faizal❤❤
This is called Talent  # Ali Fazal
I already seen knives out
#alifazal op
Are all the books about murder on a vehicle in a remote area?   I'm guessing they all did it again.
First the TRAIN..... Now the SHIP   .....  I won't be surprised if everyone is the killer ....
0:37 guddu bayya💪🥳🥳
Is this the sequel of murder on the orient express movie???? Omg
Ali Fazal. 👏
One & only ALI FAZAL is the reason I came to watch this trailer and waiting for October 23 to watch the film

Indian hit like for Guddu Bhaiya

well... I love A. Christie! Can't wait. Depeche Mode "Policy of Truth" perfectly used. Lovely version!
God bless u @ali Fazal
Ali fazal ko kon dekhne aaya yaha 😂😂😂 thoko likes
we asked for Mirzapur season 2 not this
I love it when they cast anti-hindu massacre riots inciter like Ali Fazal ❤️ only islam will rule the world inshallah
I thought Margot Robbie is in the cast. Im shookt
Fave Agatha Christie by far, can’t wait to see this.
so no ones gonna talk about how bad the costumes are
Starting ka rome wala scene dhruv rathi ki video me koun koun dekha h???
It's part two of Orient express ..
I don't want to be one of those people, but all I can take away from this trailer is that his mustache is just so wrong. Petition to fix his mustache and make it look more like David Suchet's version! Hey, if they can fix Sonic..
We proud of you Ali Fazal ❤️😍 love from India 🇮🇳😊🙏
Sa wakas!
Who is here to see Ali Fazal🇮🇳
Awesome
Ok so this is what u get when u mix Murder on the Orient express, murder mystery and knives out 🤣🤣
No idea why theyre remaking Poirot when the best ever adaptation of Poirot was by David Suchet only recently(Late 90s through early 2000s) . I love Ken B but his portrayal is not good compared to Suchet. At least cast Suchet if you want to remake.

Emma Mackey Looks Hot As Hell. Can’t wait to see what see does.. Loving Mackey❤️❤️❤️❤️
“ Ali Fazal Gang “
Ali faizal fan❤
So it's the 2nd part of Murder in the Oriental express
I have no idea why they try and redo something which has already been done so perfectly, with David Suchet. This version of Poirot is SO MEH - even his accent.
Waiting ❤️ali fazal❤️
Kismat ho to inke jaisi ho, nahi to jinda to ....................  hai
40: Who seen ali fazal 😍 Proud to be an Indian 🇮🇳
Who's here for Emma Mackey?
Came here for Ali Fazal💜
Anybody noticed guddu bhaiya
Guddu bhi hai😂😂😂
Branagh is terrible as Poirot... I cannot listen to him or watch him. David Sachet was soooo much better! But I will watch it anyway. SPOILER: the murderers are the pair of lovers ]:->
ALI OP

Haven't expected Maeve will Come here Leaving Otis.....😂😂😂😂

Maeve and Diana❤🔥
Ali fazal is so talented..
Most expected trailer 🙌🔥 Gal gadot 😍❤ Emma Mackey ❤😍 Agatha Christie novel🔥🔥
I came only for guddu bhaiya❤️
Isn’t this the same idea as Murder on the orient express?
So we are having an Agatha Christie movie universe
Uhmmm "Murder On the Orient Express" kinda vibes?? Or same detective, just a second installment of the series??? 🤔🤔
Kenneth Branagh is a good actor and I like him but after Lockhart, Poirot would be the second character that he REALLY doesn't fit
Hell yeah!
This will be epic.
Guddu bhaiya 😍💥

This is a prequel for Knives Out.
Zindagi ho toh aisi ho.. Zinda toh Jhant ke baal bhi hai. #GudduBhaiya

This is how you do a trailer. Give the audience enough to make them intrigued without revealing the entire plot and the ending
0:37 guddu bhaiya❤ This is what we called the real talent not like jhanvi kapoor with zero expression
Any one here for Ali Faizal...💙#mirjapur
Ali Fazal ⭐

“I’m not sure if this is for you.” https://youtu.be/IvbOmwPrib0
“I’m not sure if this is for you.” https://youtu.be/IvbOmwPrib0
Looks like a great cast.
I enjoyed murder on the orient express despite the criticism it felt like Agatha Christie. I’m super excited for this- another amazing cast
Ali fazal ❤️
Waiting time
Wow
Guddu bhaiya spotted✌️✌️🥰
Ali fazial Mirzapur to this 💯🔥🔥🔥♥️
Just another remake that’s all Hollywood has anymore.
This film plot story seems like murder on orient express or knive out!
Ali fazal v h bhai😄😄 guddu bhaiya
If there was a parody for this movie, Inspector Jacques Clouseau from Pink Panther would be a great investigator
Looks interesting   Do i want to watch it: no     Will i watch it: yes
its 20th century FOX  for me
dont look at the bible like Jesus forgives all sins but look at it like he would be pissed if he littered
Knives out with accents. I for it.
Wait, what Ali Faizal is doing here🤯😱.... I am happy for you guddu bhaiya
I will be watching this because of Emma Mackey ❤ this is her 1st role in a major movie
Murder on a Orient Express Then Murder on a cruise Ship  Next Murder on a plane Next Murder on a submarine Next Murder on a Space Station Next Murder on Mars  Next Murder of Hercule himself
Who is here for Ali fazal....
Aree, Guddu bhaiyya Mirzapur chhodke Egypt aa gye!!
Nice trailer but I have to ask: Did anyone demanded a Sequel to Murder on The Oriental Express?
Well, that's a surprise. French and Saunders, together again.
So ali fazal has a side role.  But still guddu bhaiya rocks. 😎😎😎
Any goodo bhaiya aka Ali Faizal..fans
So basically Knives Out on a river
Who is here 4 Ali Fajal ( Guddu Bhaia )
I’m excited for the return of Hercules Poirot and to find out who done it and solve this murder and find out who was the guilty party in this mystery
Ali Fazal probably doesn't worry about Nepotism in Bollywood.
No one can ever top David Suchet for me. He WAS Poirot.
LET ME TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE THE DAY MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS GOT ANNOUNCED FOR THIS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Hamto sirf guddu pandit ko dekhne Aaye hai...😎😎😎
I NEED this song cover!
were getting a lot of  group murder mysteries lately
Thank you, 20th Century Studios!

Wait.. French and Saunders??
Who else came here for Guddu Bhaiya i.e. ALI FAISAL
Okay, now I want this version of the Depeche Mode song.
Great to see Brit icons French and Saunders in a big screen movie.
omggg i’ve been waiting for this!
Here’s another story of a cheating man making the women look crazy 😒😒
i miss Fox logo 😭
Who is bette davis in this movie?
Who came here for guddu bhaiya ❤️ 👇️
Guddu Bhaiya❤️❤️ Mirzapur ko America bna diye.
So is this going to be in theaters?
wow, 1min33sec shot background came from a 2001 video game
00:13 Why the hell do Armie's fingers seem like they are going beyond the legs?
Wow what an original idea never seen anything like it ever, so exciting.
Guddu bhaiya rocks
Of course you aren't safe on a cruise. The killer is COVID
Very Baz Luhrmann-esque.
Great Gatsby vibezzzzz
That Poirot accent sounds exactly like David Suchet's. Nailed it. I absolutely loved watching Mystery as a kid on PBS lol This looks really cool.
"You hide something" I see evil in this ship.
Definitely here because of Emma Mackey. Love you Maeve!!!!!
Jealousy really is the ugliest trait
Hercule Poirot😍😍
Sooo, they're going to kill off Gal Gadot in this. That's what I'm seeing so far.
I had been waiting for this since the last movie! Can't wait to see it!
The sing is Policy of Truth. Give me my like people!!!
>20th Century Studios  Disgusting
Aaaa.. no. This isn't Hercule Poirot. You guys do yourself a favor and watch the tv series. This is gonna flop hard.
I must have missed it. But where is David Suchet? I thought it was a movie about Poirot.
ALI FAZAL YAAASSSSSSS❤️❤️❤️
Orient Express was great , so lets wait for the next chapter.
This looks like Murder on the Orient Express
I’m reading the book rn for the first time ✌🏻
I’m such a huge fan of Agatha Christie, I hope this does her justice. Right now it just feels a bit overproduced, I hope they let the story speak for itself.
I no longer need my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I want Rose Leslie to say *"You Know Nothing Detective Hercule Poirot"*
Plot twist: All the suspects are the killers (again)!
I'm calling it, Emma and Armie are the suspects and Gal is the victim. If you read the book you will know I'm right
Tbh I wasn’t a fan of knives out
Wow, that's quite the all star cast.
Your making new movies atleast,  Are you celebrating an, 100th Anniversary When you reach your, 2CS years to  100 That’s the same as the 75th logo, or is it something different
I’m into the mustache look on Armie Hammer 😘
Hi, looks good to me!  Though they could do with a bit more of an ethnic mix, given their location!
There will never be a better Poirot than David Suchet. Although I'm excited for this because of the cast.
the casting in this my god
This film is going to be much, much worse than the 1978 film with Peter Ustinov AND the 2004 TV adaptation with David Suchet.  I just hope Rose Leslie isn't going to do a French accent.
1st murder on orient Express  2nd knives out 3rd this movie. so now that all the big franchise and saga movies are dying I guess it's time we turn to murder
He’s back!!!!
I had a lot of fun watching Murder on the Orient Express so I’m quite excited
I thought this was some another stupid Disney movie.
Kinda weird to think this is a Disney movie technically
My mom read these books and the first film was so good!
Sooooooo basically Knives Out on a Boat?
"october 23rd" ....we hope
The Fairy Godmother from Shrek 2 is in this (Jennifer Saunders)!!!
It's awesome that Depeche Mode's Policy of Truth is in this trailer. Unlike Imagine Dragons in the Murder on the Orient Express...
Mojaa mojaa!!
I'm just here for Ali Faizal 🔥🔥🔥
Tremendo trailer!!!
Looks fantastic!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. Non-Duality✌️&♥️
Woo-hoo!  Thinly veiled Masonic FUN!!!  Can't abide the gang-stalking, but I tend to LOVE their movies.
"One Random Person Who Likes This Will Become a Billionaire" Goodluck🍀
A goose bump worthy trailer that sets the stage for the who-dun-it perfectly!  Excited to watch this one!
Zee crime eez murrhhdurrhh
Wheres all the Depeche Mode fans at? 🖐
Good to see Rose Leslie getting work. I loved her in GOT. That said, having no knowledge of the story, I really hope this isn't just another case of every suspect did it again, like Murder on the Orient Express is.
Hopefully next third sequel would be on the island with 10 strangers from the book “ then there was none !!
Oh what’s this song?
It was the husband
It's still gonna be PG-13 like Orient Express! I hope this will have a Certified Fresh! Orient Express has 60%!
Famous faces, stupid trailer. Not looking forward to this.
It look amazing I can’t wait for it
I'm very excited for the participation of Emma Mackey in this movie, the whole cast is awesome!!
The main dude in all "these figure it out mystery" movies has a dude with a mustache
Did Gal Gadot just do an American accent?
Gosh. Looking forward to this masterpiece.  Already love. Because of Armie.
Ali Fazal ❤️
AAAGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AGATHA CHRISTIE!!!!!!!!!
If someone locks me in a room with a whole bunch of people and told me that one of us is a murderer, I’d be like BIT** let me out unless you want a SECOND murderer😂😂
This looks great
I hate they are remaking this.
Lovely cast and soundtrack .
in theaters this October 23.
Ali Faisal🔥🔥
The 1978 film was superb! This looks like it won’t disappoint.
Looks so beautiful.
Can't wait to see it, especially since Murder On The Orient Express was so good.  Kenneth Branagh is an excellent Poirot.
French & Saunders?   Nice.
I'm a David Suchet purist when it comes to Poirot. Nobody does it better and I don't care about the cast in this but that new mix of Depeche Mode's "policy of truth" has reeled me right in. That sounds superb
Yooo I was just thinking THIS LOOKS AND SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR!! YEEEEE so excited !!!
Policy of Truth. That sounds amazing. Two of my favourite things put together. Poirot and Depeche Mode.
Awesome trailer built in alot of expectations
Nobody: Ali Fazal: "Gand na phulao, maa chod denge tumhari"
Who else came here to see ali fazal 👌👌👌😎
OMG!!!!!! Can’t waittt!
Might give "KNIVES OUT "a run for its deniro "TIME WILL TELL"
Ali Fazal♥️♥️
Ooooo I’ve been waiting for this! YES! SOME JOY.
thank you for depeche mode 🖤
Thank you for sharing!Hope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube.
Linett in a silver dress again! The nostalgia man. I remember watching the original and being absolutely stunned by her figure and style
“...but this.... has altered the shape of my mustache” lmao
1:06 The Knives Come out---oh wait wrong who dun it.
Gal Gadot & Letitia Wright 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 #slay
So gal godot is officially an actress now?
The only good thing about this is Israeli babe Gal Gadot.
1. Peter Ustinov was the definitive Poirot. 2. I despise Russell Brand. 3. Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French are annoying. 4. I'll be giving this a miss.
Le guduu bhaiyaa after seeing romantic scene and kisses- Zindagi ho toh aisi ho warana jinda toh jhaat k Baal bhi h
0:38 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳......
sounds like a terrible adaptation, but i'd do anything for that cast
Armie's looks exactly as I imagined the character would look like. Hope this as good as the book!
In Theaters Oct. 23rd... Bet...
Murder on the Orient express any one
Emma Mackey !? Yeah!
Dammmm!! I’ve been waiting for this movie and it’s coming out soon I hope that movie being better than the last one
Hmm
Ali Fazal 🤩🤩
I’ve been looking forward to this since Murder on the Orient Express came out.
Depeche Mode!
At 0:41 Emma Mackey....😍😍😍
One Adam Sandler please.
Guddu bhaiya
Who noticed Ali Faizal at 0:35 🙏🏻
The best movies about Poirot - with Peter Ustinov. Time when Hollywood spent a lot of money to film luxuries movies, not cheep computer versions.
Another Agatha Christie masterpiece ruined.
My boi Poirot is back at it again
ygritte 🥺
FYI: This is a sequel to ‘Murder on The Orient Express’
0:00 HAHAHA! "20TH CENTURY STUDIOS" NOW🤣
Finally a trailer that doesn't spoil the whole plot!
i didn't know they were making a sequel to murder on the orient express. and once again the trailer music is amazing! depche mode is a classic
finally i am so happy
Soo happy to see Emma here ❤️
Gal Gadot 😍💝
Its hyped me.. Alot going to watch this sure.
Is he the same detective who was in Murder on the Orient Express ??
worth a watch...murder on the orient express didn't  disappoint.
bb
I liked the first a lot, this looks Good
Awesome! Now where's Knives Out 2
Bruh, I lowkey was just thinking about Emma Mackey yesterday😂😂
i hope this version of the be included on the soundtrack
Emma Mackey... ❤️
I am the biggest Agatha Christie fan (I have read and own 30+ of her novels and I’ve seen nearly every adaptation of her books) and I really loved Murder on the Orient Express (2017) except I did feel the ending was rushed. I am SOOOOOO excited for this movie!!
Are guddu bhaiya ❤❤❤🔥
Wow.
Real success Guddu bhaiya 💙 Proud to be Indian 🇮🇳
Just come here for Ali Fazal
You can make murder mystery but you cannot make it better than likes of Knives out
So a second movie playing mafia?
So the rumors were true, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern are together
All i see is Wonder woman and Maeve Wiley!
Finally something good came from 2020
Who is here for Ali Faizal ❤ 🤗
Finally the movie that will get me back into the theaters! Looks awesome!
0:37 Ali Fazal 🤩
Maeve is bangin!
Please don´t ruin it like Orient Express. Trailer looks sooo good!
I came just to see Ali Fazal..🖤
Ali fazal ❤️
0:38 ❤️❤️❤️
Ohh baby....Orient express, but sexier
Never read the books, but enjoyed the hell outta the first one, don't understand why it was hated. This looks just as good. Along with "Knives Out" I can see the ol timely Hollywood is coming back 👌
❤❤❤awesome😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍
Wow! What a cast!
I am so happy right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks gorgeous. Gives shivers. All I want now..... Dude, another Agatha Christie novel. I'm down anyday❤️
Wow! It feels like eons where we don't to see a "New Trailer" being released in the internet, coming this fall in "Theaters". It's so refreshing, it's like we're coming out of the cave for the first time.🥺
I m here to see Ali Fazal, Guddu Bhaiyya.
I almost didn’t even recognize Russell Brand, he actually doesn’t look homeless now
The Otterbourne characters weren't black in the novel and don't fit the part, but i guess in 2020 you can't keep authenticity with all the agendas. Other than that, this looks like a big improvement on Orient Express, but i was equally impressed with that trailer too and was disappointed when seeing the full movie.
Wow! It feels like eons where we don't to see a "New Trailer" being released in the internet, coming this fall in "Theaters". It's so refreshing, it's like we're coming out of the cave for the first time. Hoping and praying that we could have a vaccine already. So everything will be back to normal, and we could watch new mainstream big movies and all other that have been delayed on the silver screen.🥺
Finally!!!
0:37 That dude reminds me a hell lot of Oscar Isaac.
Margot Robbie + Daisy Ridley = Emma Mackey
Gal Gadot ? Ok I m in.
what Depeche Mode song is this
Idk why I was so genuinely shocked to see Russell Brand 😱
I’m so ridiculously excited about this.
That moustache is stupid and ridiculous. Cant take the movie seriously and it ruins poirot completely.
Great
Ali Fazal 😋
Hello yes hi, just here to do the lord's work and tell you the song in the trailer is a trailerized version of 'Policy Of Truth' by Depeche Mode.
I have absolute faith in this after my favorite Hamlet’s masterful work on Orient Express even  though I know how this turns out. Or do I?
Ali Rocks
Ali fazal & Gal Gadot. 😍🔥
Wow..maeve is here
Spoilers alert: Gal gadot will get killed. You can read summary of book on Wikipedia. 😅😅
Great song choice!!!
Another Agatha Christie's masterpiece going to be adapted she was so good at her work that even now her stories sell best.
To all the Indians reacting to Ali Fazal's part in the movie, let me tell you he's quite involved with Hollywood since a long time. He has worked with some of the finest in the industry for example- Dame Judi Dench in Victoria and Abdul as well as Fast and Furious movie etc.
00:37  ali fazal                   Thank me right now
Guddu bhaiyya..💪😎
Hmm. As a huge Agatha Christie fan and as someone who was pleased enough with MOTOE to buy it on 4K Blu-Ray, I've been waiting for this trailer. And now that it's here . . . hmm . . . something feels off. This is a classic story set in the 1930s but this trailer does not feel particularly classic. I think they're trying too hard to make it feel modern and appeal to younger audiences. It's too sleek and sexed up, and lacks the quaint charm of Christie's story. My hope here is that it's just the TRAILER that feels this way and the movie will be different. The film will have to be good to give the '78 version a run for its money.
Ye Ali Fazal mirzapur ko chodke kya kar raha sala season 2 le aao ab toh be
0:37  Kesa lAGA SURPRISE ... :) 8==D.
Hercule Poirot back at it again! Also Emma Mackey innit♡
This is not the new Indiana Jones movie. 😧😳😳😳😳😥😥😥
And the bastardization of Poirot continues...
"... In theatres this October 23", in another Corona FREE dimension!!!
I saw guddu bhaiya in the trailer😂
Ali fazal entry 00:36
Sooo it’s knives out on a boat?
This is exactly how it looked like when I was reading the book, except for some minor details.
00:37 Mirzapur ko chod ke aap yeha ho sir
Ali faizal rocks
Will watch this movie only for ali faizal❤❤
Song please?
Are guddu bhaiya yha pahuch gai aap 🙏
Only fr Ali Fazal♥️
We need to talk about how Emma Mackey looks eerily similar to Margot Robbie...
What the hell is this?????? This is Blockbuster..
Murder on the Orient Express: Boat Edition
? goúd? 👁 wanna c it 👏🏽. Thx u 🙌🏽💀😤♎..
I knew Ali Fazal Is going to be in the Trailer
Queen mackey shining in old school form too😍❤️
A++++ use of Depeche Mode
Those river shots look bad so far😂

How many surprised to see Ali Fazal??🧐  https://youtu.be/fnuXJpmwWTQ
Indians are gonna set this on fire ♥️✨💯
And it's got French & Saunders!
Ali Fazal❤️  Hollywood is Gand fadd ke rakh denge:- Guddu bhaiya😆🔥
Guddu bhaiya hollywood se fursat mil jaye to mirzapur 2 bhi le laao... Big fan ali fazal😍😍
Fine I am drooling now. Plus, ARMIE!!!!❤🔥
Sorry, it'll never beat the 1978 version with its perfect casting of the pearl-loving socialite, Bette Davis, bickering with her nurse/companion, Maggie Smith. With Angela Lansbury as the forever slurring, smutty-romance book writer, Salome Otterbourne.  Along with the eternally debonair David Niven as Poirot's sidekick.  And of course, Peter Ustinov, as the vain, portly gourmand Belgian detective.  Even Mia Farrow, looking both fragile and demented as the supposedly jilted lover driven to murder.  I hated what Branagh did with Murder On The Orient Express. And his handle-bar moustache, so off-putting. Poirot is vain, yes, but vainglorious Branagh plays him OTT.  Nah, forget this Branagh version.  It's the 78 film for me!
70mm looks gooooorgeous
I can't wait to watch this at home a year from now.
Mog ali is here
I'm looking forward to this, but I hope that he doesn't spoil the ending like he did with Murder On The Orient Express.
How many of u after knowing Ali fazal is there in the movie ?
Are guddu bhaiya idhar hai.. hum Kaha aapko mirzapur me doondh rahe the..
What a star cast dude......... Gal gadot..... Guddu bhaiya... Omg!
David Suchet is da best
I just remembered when I read Agatha Christie's books some few years back. Am so glad to be seeing them come to life
O Boy ! This movie is gonna burn the theaters into ground! All my favourites are here
Yeah man here comes the Guddu from Mirzapur, Ho hoo Kudos to Ali Fazal
Lol this movie again
No surprise that Ali Fazal is in this movie...exited to watch the movie😍
Ali fazal is making India proud but still Indians have no respect for such talents👎Shame👎I m sure those nepo kids wont even paas the audition for hollywood movies too🤮 Proud of Ali Fazal♥️
I’m so excited with this trailer, IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Give me a like if you think the same way.
Gal & roselesie 😍 I think this will be the massive hit of the year
I love detective movies. Like from INDIA.
Emma Mackey!  Oh boy! She is doing so well.
I enjoyed Orient Express very much. Looking forward to this one 🤟
0:37 Guddu bhaiya my man🤘 love you brother
Is it sequel of the Murder in the orient express?
Super
1:23 Poirot Is Back
All I see is Kenneth Branaugh's apology for Artemis Fowl.
Cannot wait!!!
Gal Gadot, rose Leslie, Emma Mackey, Letitia wright, Ali Fazal and Armie hammer. Need I say more?
Gal Gadot super figa💕
#GUDUBHAIYAAA ROCK...🙏 @Alifaizal ❤️
Spoiler : They are all murderers. They take turns stabbing the victim.
Ali Fazal❤
0:37  Ali fazal, 👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Guddu Bhaiya
Really enjoyed 'Murder on the Orient Express'. Excited to see this one.
Can't wait to watch It! Emma Mackey is in it!
Sooo glad to see Ali fazal yet again in a Hollywood movie 🤩 Amazing talent coming up
Woww!!!!
Ali fazal ❤️
0:37 guddu bhaiya 🔥

Great trailer!
Detective Hercule returns After MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS....
Guddu bhaiya:Gand phadke rakh denga
Guddu bhaiaya humare Mirzapur se hollywood chale gaye hai
#Alifazal.. #Guddu bhaiya
So nobody wants to talk about the holy moly cast? I mean Gal Gadot  Emma Mackay Armie Hammer Ali Fazal  Rose Leslie
Having watched this trailer I can say one thing for sure: Either the direction and story of this movie has to be absolutely out of the park or it's going to be the biggest bomb of the year ( BTW the signs are there in the trailer)
It looks like " raat akeli hai " ka Hollywood version
Yesss!!! A sequel to one of my favorite detective movies ever!!!❤❤
Struggler Ali faizal
Feeling peroud
I will watch this movie for Ali Faizal ❤💕💖
Guddu bhaya
MOVIE LEAK : Theirs a murderer on a boat...         Maybe that Cripple guy from S** Education I don't know who did it. XD
I am here for Ali Fazal 😌
ali fazal❤
0:21 😍😘 1:04  Gal So Hot 💥💣🔥🔥🔥
So excited for this!  I hope this will become a trilogy!
yet another trailer whoring an 80s/90s tune in slow motion, even if it is the original artist this time.   The movie's set in Egypt motherfuckers, do something original.   what a completely dickless age this is.
This looks better than the first one, I hope they keep it enclosed as that builds better tension and I REALLY hope the mystery is good, the ending to the last one was very meh.
Feeling proud for Ali Fazal 🇮🇳
Those who have read the book are more excited !
"20th century studio" No more Fox 😔😔💔
😴🙄👎🏼 typical liberal (waste) of good film 👋🏼🎤
Indian's Watching This Trailer For #AliFazal #Mirzapur #GudduBhaiya

Never expected to hear Depeche Mode!
Hey guys I just created a new YouTube channel it’s called Mabel & Jo please go check it out

Wonder woman in new wonderer Avatar
The costumes look BORING!!!!
Jyada **** na fulao.
dislike the video  why hollywood only choose muslim actors from india ,we have many hindu actors like akshay kumar,sunny deol , amitabh bachhan, pankaj tripathi ,manoj bajpayee .....why hollywood choose muslim actor ? why disrespecting hindu dharma ? why so much hatred towards us hindu people ? where is your secularism now hollywood ? oh i see the liberal lobbyists hijacked hollywood to shame hindu faith ............. if sushant singh rajput would have been alive he would have acted much better than this terrorist ali fazal , i firmly believe there must be some hollywood elites behind sushant's suicide. #savehindu #boycotthollywood #justiceforSSR
Me: Um excuse me Mr. Studio exec, I have a question? Studio exec: yes what's your question? Me: Can we get this movie in black and white also? Studio exec: why? Me: because this looks fuckin beautiful!!!!
Murder on orient express  And now this
Well I'm not surprised it being made into a movie, it even has a mystery video game i think.
From Mirzapur to Hollywood  Our Guddu Bhaiya❤️ Aka Ali Fazal
Knives out?
That's what should happen if you try to score 2 girls... #LeaveGirlsForOtheeVirgins

Ali Fazal is going to surprise everyone who dont know him
Emma Mackey or Margot Robbie?
Good to see Ali Fazal. ❤
Looks like a B movie. Murder on the Orient Express was a forgettable film, I think this will be too. :/  Hmm How does Kenneth keep getting gigs?
Ali fazal......🔥🔥🙈🙈
I can't believe this! I see my first and all-time favourite Agatha Christie novel being literalized as a movie! I see Emma Mackey, Gal Gadot in opposing leads! I see Ali Fazal getting recognised! I see...my dream coming true!😭
Ali Fazal OP
Lets hope Russell Brand has a non speaking part
I hated his interpretation of Murder on the Orient Express, watching this trailer too gives me very little faith.
Gal gavotte is so beautiful
I see what they did there... just flashes , glimpses strong enough that we can see their faces and therefore who they are...
Just came to watch #Wonder_Woman..💓💓

Before the film starts a screen will come up saying "The following film was filmed before the events of the corona virus outbreak".  Plot twist: the real killer was the rona (poirot voice)

For those who are asking, the song title is Policy of Truth by Depeche mode
Did I see Ali fasal in this trailer ??? 😱😱😱
Anyone else notice Russell Brand? Did not recognize and totally excited for this 👌
Between using Believer for the first movie and now this song, whoever chooses the music for these trailers needs to be fired.

Wait did I just see Ali Fazal....❤️
Wonder Woman and Green Lantern.     Oh wait
Out of curiosity, does anybody know which of the scenes were shot in Egypt and which ones were shot in a British studio?
Ali Fazal you rock man🔥
You mean.. "Murder on the Orient Knives Out Express Nile." - nice.
ALI FAZAL OP🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Like for ALI FAZAL 🇮🇳
Welcome to Hollywood Ali bhai.. 😍
That's awesome!!
Ali fazal @0:38 Here comes the Indian viewers
0:37 Ali Fazal 🇮🇳❣️
Emma Mackey first big movie!
I thought for a moment thats Margot Robbie in the trailer....but its her doppelganger Emma McKay 😂
Spoiler : the book has been out for 83 years...
Ali Fazal Guddu vaiya  Mirzapur  Likes🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
are guddu bhaiya from mirzapur😍😍😍
Me after seeing Ali Fazal. "GUDDU BHAIYA !!!! Sidha Bidesi...Bhaukal"
Is it sequel of murder on a orient express
IM SO EXCITED
Maeve😍😍
Ali bhai
Is that Emma Mackey?! 😃😃😃
MIRJAPUR TO HOLLYWOOD 😍 Guess who🤔
ALI FAIZAL🇮🇳🇮🇳 #GudduBhaiyaOP
Murder on the Orient Express 2
Gal gadot can do another role than wonder woman.  I ❤this.
Ali fazal is like sooo goood ♥️
Byomkesh Bakshi of Nile 😀
I wonder if this is before Orient or after in  Christie's novels, because Poirot looks younger here.
Oh Maeve *_*
Ali Faizal. Wow. Kudos to him 🇮🇳✌️😊 also excited to see Armie hammer 😍 nice trailer👍
I was a big fan of the orient Express movie, can't wait for this one
Not as A-List-y as the last cast, but maybe that's for the better
familiar faces
Guddu bhaiya...
how the lead character's name pronounced?
"That is why most great love stories are tragedies." They altered the last line from the book ugh.
It'll be another gorgeous-looking film.  I love Branagh's funny accent and mustache.  Russell Brand looks, different, with short hair.  I almost didn't recognize him. Gal Gadot doing an American accent sounds, like Scarlett Johansson, huh.
this looks terrible.  honestly, branaugh with this absurd Belgian accent is a sad joke.
Bleh. Murder on the Orient Express was bland. Kenneth Barnagh's portrayal of Hercule Poirot is boring.  Do this same kind of series with Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc from Knives Out, and then you'll have a real murder mystery movie series!
Happy to see Ali Fazal and Emma Mackey in here!
Ali fazal🔥
Hamare Guddu bhaiya urf Ali fazal ki jai🙏
Ufff.. dark 😘😘😘
Ali 😎
Guddu bhaiyya!
Seems like major flop
Guddu bhaiya yaha bhi!!!!
Haven't seen a single person mention that both French & Saunders are in this movie.
I think I will pass on this one, Russell Brand is a deal breaker for me.
Ali fazal is probably one of the best Bollywood actors...
Everyone who knows the twist, like this comment! ;)
finally
I hope I can see this in theaters
YES YES YES!!!! One of my favorite stories! And I love the classic movie with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot! CAN - NOT - WAIT!!!
Ali Fazal is love ❣️
Here for Ali Fazal❤️🔥
I missed the days of the pop culture giving us constantly new movie trailers to be excited and discussing about.  🥂 Here's to hoping for much faster normalcy

Need to make sure if its Margot Robbie or Emma Mackey lol
Ali Bhai🔥🔥🔥
OMG, I thought it was Margot Robbie in the beginning.
This is gonna be good!
Did i see guddu bhayya
😍" Great female cast!! ♥️💕
I’m freaking out right know I’m gonna start crying ..
0:38 🇮🇳 Guddu Bhaiya toh saat samandar paar kar gaye
Emma❤️
0:28 That moment when Russell Brand is the sexiest Professor Plum MF you ever did see.
Guddu bhaiyya ❤
0:37 here is my hero 🤘🤘❤️❤️❤️
I thought Ali Faizal would atleast have 1 dailouge in the tralier ... disappointed to see such a talented guy backed up... otherwise trailer seems awesome
Imagine if this was Rian Johnson rather than the director of Artemis Fowl. It just looks so forced and cheesy.
So Poirot has become Nick Fury apparently.
this music in the beginning reminded me of master chef Australia's "suspense" music
A normal movie.... . . . . . . . 1:22 fcuk Hercule Poirot🤯
0:38 ali zafar. ❤🇮🇳
Trailer is generic AF, hoping movie will be better
Delighted to see a good movie trailer again, looking forward to watching the movie on the big screen!
Ali fazal 😍😍
I hope ali fazal rocks in this movie
0:38 Ali fazal 😎👍
Why I feel I saw Ali Fazal 🙄🙄
👍 for the "French" accent
Why are there no comments about Emma Mackey?
This is technically a romance film.
No body talked about "Agatha Christie" 🙄🙄
Agatha Christie was a literary *mastermind*
Hopefully this will get Kenneth back on his feet after Fartemis Foul
Ali faizal🔥🔥❤
Ali Fazal🔥... What a journey bro... love from INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳
I'm so hyped for this. Woooooooooooot
I see Shuri and Diana Prince 😍
Ali Fazal from INDIA ❤️
I CAN'T WAIT
"Murder was just the beginning " awesome line ...
Guddu Bhaiya a.k.a Ali Fazal is here,  He is going to be Hollywood star soon,
Am I the only one who thinks the narrator’s accent is weird? Okay.
How many are here for Ali Faizal?
I seee ali fazal ❤
Wonder woman, Shuri, Hercule Poirot and Guddu bhaiya OP
French and Saunders together again :)
All the actors are so likable
This move looks so good. If it’s bad, then I’ll be in denial *insert drums here*
There is only one truth
Shout out for Ali Fazal - the charismatic dude from India.
Guddu bhaiya yaha pohoch gaye....

Can anyone tell me the song of the trailer?
What's up Maeve....
OMG it’s going to be awesome
I have no faith in this film. I didn’t like Murder on the Orient Express. I HATED Artemis Fowl. The only reason why I will watch is for the cast.

Ali Fazal long way to Go 🔥❤️❤️
I hope they don’t ruin the book as they did with Murder on the Orient Express
Ali Fazal is on next level...
I dunno I liked the older versions of the movies.. Kenneth braunagh isn't doing it for me.. There was a quaint charm in those movies.. The tension was established by setting not by such out of place music..
I need this Depeche Mode remix asap
Here only for ali fazal ❤️🎉
Murder on the Orient Express was, I think, a very great movie. Thanks for making that movie. Back then, as 20th Century Fox, you were 1 of the best studios of all time. I'm still disappointed that Disney changed it to 20th Century Studios, but I think 20th Century Fox is a better name. Just my opinion. You still are a great studio.
I swear that's Oscar Isaac but he's not credited in the film. Am I going crazy?
0:38 Proud Moment For India Ali Fazal
Ali bhaii on fire🔥🔥🔥
Are the theaters opening?
#emma😘
Seeing the thumbnail for the trailer : Hmmm, lets watch. After the trailer : WTF is this cast. Oh my god

0:37 this guy seems familiar....
Guddu bhaiya in Egypt ?
Ali Fazal 😍😍😍😍Guddu bhaiya
Omg the Poirot series is the best! If anyone is interested they have some of movies on YouTube. Their from the late 90’s I believe but still hold up. ☺️❤️
I spotted you, Monsieur Poirot.  New crime, and a pair of new mustache.  I see you.
The Indian 🇮🇳 actor ali fazal appear in the movie
I understand that the cast is in alphabetical order, but why can't Kenneth Branagh get top billing? I mean, he's Hercule Poirot!
Oscar
God Gal is so goddamn hot.
Guddu😂😂

Let's hope Josh Gad doesn't have another mustache

Ali Fazal❤️
Ahhhhhh The trailer and narrative got me like so pumped up !!!!!!!!!!
Bad accent, Bad accent Bad accent
Another movie we won't get to see this year

Ali fasal bro congrats,not expected in this😮, ek baar dailog mar do "g na fulawo m c denge tumhari" 🤣
Is this a sequel to another movie?
It looks really exciting😀. Too bad it is directed by Kenneth Branagh. He is movies are usually mediocre at best.
Agatha Christie is a great writer
The first one was an okay film, it’s not a perfect film nor a bad film but I just felt it was just an okay film
Finally!!!!!  A movie trailer🤩🤩
why is anybody talking about emma mackey?
Is it going to be in cinemas in spain??
I love Gal Gadot I’m excited for this
Who notice Ali zafar
wait is this the sequel to Murder on the Orient Express or something?
The Moustache looks a bit better.
Every comment is about gal Gadot but the real deal here is the plot the story is a Agatha Christie masterpiece
Gudddu bhaiya Egypt mein??🤔🤔🤔🤔
The only reason I'm watching this Gal Gadot.
Watching an outsider Ali fazal sir coming from b'wood and working in Hollywood makes us feel proud...god bless you Ali sir. 🇮🇳❤️

When i see Letitia, i scream!!

WEIRD AND DISTURBING MOUSTACHE WITH A PEPPERING OF INCONSISTENT ACCENT RETURNS.
I'm here for ali fazal, bollywood learn something they r naming everyone in the same position in their trailer not like some of the shitty bollywood masala movies where stars r preferred over talented actors
YES. more movies like this please, Hollywood!
Liking only for Ali Fazal gr
Now Maeve knows how Otis felt.
Gal Gadot? Rose Leslie? Russell Brand? Letita Wright? Dawn French? Very interesting cast indeed, and shall make for an easier game of Six Degrees of Separation.
Shame it wasn't actually shot in Egypt
Will see for our guddu bhaiya... 😁😁😄😄
Ali Fazal. I'm IN!

Ali Fazal india guddu pandit
Who is amazed after spoting ali afsal aka pandit
Guddu bhaiya: 0:37 *Gaand na phulao, maa c***d denge tumhari*
The whole trailer I was thinking “I’m getting Murder in the Orient Express vibes” and then Kenneth Branagh walls in. Very excited
Not a fan of the new look for FOX.  Thanks, Disney.  This does not look good at all.  Ah, Kenneth Branagh is directing, now I understand why.  I was wondering why I was getting 'Murder on the Orient Express' vibes.
Proud to see Ali Fazal here
That's the Reason why mirzapur S2 got delayed 😶.
Is this what Maeve is doing after Isaac deleted Otis’s voicemail?
Soooo is this like a sequel to Murder on the Orient Express because the detective is the exact same looking guy and actor but with a different name? I know this is a remake of the old film/novel like Orient Express
What is Ali Fazal doing in this film? Just got a glimpse of Guddu bhaiya
Depeche Mode! Dawn French and Jennifer saunders! Love it
Here for Ali Fazal!
anyone wants to know the spoiller? i am sure they will ruin the novel.
Ali Fazal 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤❤🙏🙏
That was not Margot Robbie Emma Mackie again decepting me
Was there ali afzal in this ?
Proud to be Ali is Fan💖💖💖
Oh I’m so down for this. I enjoyed the first enough but I’ve been really itching for a great whodunnit mystery. Inject it in my veins!
Guddu bhaiya
Looks so good. I am glad R L did not talk in the trailer. I hate her voice. #sorrynotsorry
Guddu bhaiya from mirzapur really shocked 🎉🎉🎉
0:37 Ali Faizal 😀
Yes...💪
Excited To See Ali Fazal & Gal Gadot In This Movie 😍😍😍
India's all cinemas remains closed till October month.. so no chance..
This French and Saunders sketch seems a lot darker than usual
It already looks great, I’m not sure if it makes up for Artemis Fowl.
Worsted trailer 👎👎👎👎
Emma Mackey 💜💜💜💜
Awesome cast. Can’t wait to watch on my tv since theaters are not an option for many
This is going to be awesome
How many are here surprised after seeing Ali Fazal in this trailer😎🙋
I see Gal Gadot i click the play button so Fast🤷
I just came for Ali Faizal when he post it in the story
When wonder woman free time do this😂😅😂😜😜😜
I’ll bet Jeff Bezos bank account that everyone had something to do with the murder
hope gal gadot comes back on  the fast and furious movie trilogy, shes one of my favorites on  the fast and furious movie trilogy
Here for Ali Fazal
Are guddu bhaiya aap yha
Starring and directed by Kenneth Branagh, _Murder on the Orient Express_ wasn't too good. However, it seems enough cash was made to finance another film in the franchise, with the same director. Hopefully this one's way better.
Except radical islamist supporter ali fazal everything good in movie ....
Ali Fazal 👌
Branagh is on the roll, almost a movie a year)
Guddu bhaiya op
Alii Bhai😍❤️
Anyone knows what version of Policy of Truth is that?! It's amazing!
Let’s do murder on the orient express, but on a boat. Jk it looks super good and I know it’s a sequel
It was great to see Ali Fazal in the movie. The cinematography of the movie is very good.
Looking really good!
Poirot is back 🎉🔥
Yesssssssss..finally it's out

HERCULEEEEEE
2 Character From Netflix    Maeve & Nancy 😍🌸
Armie hammer is the killer .. I call it🙋‍♂️
Looks exciting. Hope it won’t get pushed.
Everyone gangsta until you see Poirot's moustache
I loved Kenneth Branagh in the first movie...it was suprising since I am a big fan of the series with the suberb David Suchet...I cant wait for this one!! it looks amazing!!!
Goodbye, ridiculously big moustache    Hello, ridiculously tiny moustache
Yeeees, let's go!! So excited
Like for Ali Fazal❤️
Ali!! 🇮🇳
Who here for ali fazal
Gal Gadot🔥🔥🔥
i hate this kind of movie.. its disgustingly pretentious
This is remind me of the murder of the Orient Express, but this time on the boat! And Armie Hammer looks cute ❤️
Aight, Branagh, after Artemis Fowl, you practically owe the world compensation. This better be good.
Ali  fazal in there for a frame. Hope he has a good role
Ali Fazal❤❤
margot robbie looks....different
Nepotism boycott...😂😂😂
This is like knives out
Indonesia, please open up our cinemas & studios (note: hope, if possible and safe) 🇲🇨
Another all-star cast!
I am only here for the french accent for Poirot
Amazing to see Ali fazal once again in another Hollywood movie.
Where is old poirot
Bouc (Tom Bateman) is also here, I bet he's the killer 🤔🤣

What AWFUL song choices yet again ?!?! IF i do get stuck having to watch this for whatever reason it'll be for the sole purpose of enjoying Gal and Russel on screen .
Hope Kenneth Branagh  makes it a great movie cause this is now of Disney too
Came only for Gal Gadot 😻❤️
I'm a simple man, I hear Depeche Mode I already hit like. This looks quite interesting.
It looks as fake and staged as Orient Express. Still waiting for Knives Out 2.
Excited...after seein ..ali faizal from mirzapur..😃😀😃
Armie Hammer is so hot.
Only hear for our country men Faizal ali
this is the first novel of Agatha Christie >>> she wrote it when she was on a  nile cruz in my country Egypt
The original 1978 mystery movie is from Paramount Pictures and the 2020 remake movie is from 20th Century-Fox.
Is this being filmed on *celluloid?*
so many familiar faces and yet I can't figure out who they are
This is not Poirot. Garbage movie.
I’ve been waiting for this one ✨
I got chills after watching this trailer. I’m so obsessed with Murder on The Orient Express and I can’t wait for this to come out. I really hope they consider this on VOD/itunes/vudu/amazon if this will be delayed or my local theaters won’t open by October 23rd
Alexandria & Cairo

Hi Fox. I've missed u. Good thing the Mouse haven't removed u entirely.

What song is this?
Ali fazal shining
The trailer contains remix on the composition "World in My Eyes" by Depeche Mode. Does anyone know which remix is it?
The music sounds like Depeche Mode but if it didn't have synths  Aside from the end, that part has some light ones
Bhes ki aankh isme to apna ali zafar bhi hai proud to be Indian
Can’t wait To watch
Anyone knows the background song title?
Here for ali fazal ....hopes he will jave more scence  present in film ..
