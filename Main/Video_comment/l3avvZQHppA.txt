Double relegation!? This isn’t forest green
that was a horrible penalty
im happy for luton, They really deserve to be in the PL. good job luton!!
This is why we love this beautiful game
Lets see if tate come to watch a game 😂😂😂
Unbelievable achievement to go from the Conference Premier to the Premier League in just 9 seasons all the while pretty much having BUGGER ALL money to spend.
Everyone sees their promotion as something special. Well I think people who wait in the Airport deserve to be able to watch an EPL match.
Ted Lasso? Is this you?
Well done to Luton for bouncing back from the bottom of adversity and mismanagement to the highest...
Its actually extremely remarkable the fall from 10th in championship 3 straight relegation and then the recovery, a rise back to the premier League in little over 15 years.... truly astonishing.  Perhaps the modern day Wimbledon can be a comparison, almost, although worth noting Luton have been in the top division before in their history.
Cannot wait to see Harland crumble at the back street gardens of Kenilworth road
May I kindly request all away fans making their way to and from Kenilworth Road, not to relieve themselves in the front gardens of the residents of Oak Road.
Luton losing less than 6-0 at Etihad next season should be celebrated
were Never die were never die the Luton town will never die from.non league to top league league were keep the Luton flag flying high
Last time Luton got promoted to top league they relegated man city raddy antic pleat dance and all that
How can you not love promotion
They gonna be regelated next season in the Prem
Daniel Mann commentaries is just extraordinary orgasmic
Nakamba changed Luton
From everton vs leicester FC to Nott forest vs luton. The standard of EPL has dropped to level of EFL
"Manchester United are coming to Kenilworth road"
Newcastle still can’t get a mention among the ‘Big teams’ going to their stadium next year… apparently finishing top four still doesn’t stop Tottenham being mentioned instead of us 🙄
Easy 6 points for the big 6😂😂😂😂😂
Most of lads were not even yet born....It's amazing.... Congrats to Luton Town and welcome to big stages
What a story!
Anyone claiming Wrexham can't make the Prem in 10 years...this.
I teared up with Dabo.  Its ok man I know its hard but you can move on from this.
easy 6 points next season
Is Luton Town ground Premier League standard?
World Cup Final or playoff final, which penalty shoot out has the most pressure?
CONGRATULATIONS This is what football is all about. 👏🎉🥳🤩🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽🍾🥂
Im gonna be honest I don't know if they will even be allowed to play in the prem due to their stadium. The PL i don't think will allow luton to play unless they improve their stadium
Great to have the first Asian team in the premier league
Only other man that could've done the job is jay cartwright
Football has all been about the underdogs this year and it’s been fantastic to see.
Both Coventry and Luton fans were amazing. I disagree with this play off lottery but anyway so happy for LTFC.
Let the Looting begin
Deserved to go up, finished 3rd on the ladder it's generally no coincidence the 3 best sides go up. Hopefully Boro next year UTB
From non-league club to Premier League  What a journey for Luton FC. Welcome to Premier League
There going to get destroyed in the premier league...
Well done , fantastic story,,, carlisle utd fan , was hoping for luton as thats the fairytale,,, unlucky coventry ,which also would have been a great story ,,, great game and now as originally co founders of premier league you eventually get to play there,,, and as the smallest ,,, i think you will do well ,, good luck Hatters
Fantastic, this is why we love football
Milton Keynes stadium finally in the top flight. Very possible that will be the venue of Luton home games next season.
What we need another london derby
Who ?
Some fairytale 🤣🤣🤣👏🏾👏🏾
"Manchester United are coming to Kenilworth Road" As a united fan, am not too thrilled. Our away form has been abysmal this season.
Handy 6 points for my team Liverpool
I really wept for both teams. Congrats to Luton Town, they have 3 of my compatriots with them. Coventry will make it next year in Jesus name.❤
Feel sorry for 19 teams having to turn up to that shithole of a place
do not change that stadium old 😤🤣🤣
The commentator recognized that when you play Manchester United is when you get the true feeling of EPL
Well done luton, commiserations Coventry
This is the beauty of promotion and relegation, the guys in the US can never comprehend
Still remember Coventry City playing in PL Keep fighting for next season guys
Probably the greatest miracles in English football aside from the infamous Leicester City's 5000/1 triumph in 2016. From being in non-league between 2009-2014 to play against the best world players the next season! Luton thinks that they had won the Champions League at Wembley, the same venue for the 2024 final!
Wow!!! Fairytales do exist! 👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿
Welcome  to epl  Luton  town
Luton should make smart transfer
welcome Luton…✌🏻🫡
"10 years ago they were losing at home to Hyde United. Manchester United are coming to Kenilworth Road. " Some commentary that 🔥
This is where the true football happens, the big money-bags and heavyweights are a plague to football. The passion in the Football League is what makes me tune in, not the thrashings by Man City and Liverpool.   Leeds fan.
What a fairy tale
Congrats to Luton Town and sorry for Coventry for lost it's just a part of game just keep on pushing next season
Coming to stink out a stadium near you soon luton town's long ball cloggers...sad day for football.....
Going straight back down
Mad as a Hatter 🎩
Bro what the hell is up with black players and missing crucial penalties?
Congratulations from all of us @ Manchester United
Nakamba back 😮
Imagine that! Nathan Jones swapped all that for a few extra pounds from Southampton……
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Congrats Luton Town on making history can’t wait to see you at the worlds biggest stage! From a Man U fan
This will be Wrexham AFC in less than ten years…
Man city gonna be smashing Luton 9-0 next season
Now luton will be everyone's second or even first favourite premier league team, just like blackpool some time ago
will be wrexham in 2028
Im just waiting to see Haringey Borough make it to Hollywood next😅
Tahniah Luton👍👍👍
for me as a Blackpool fan I'm  very proud for Luton and the play off final reminds me of orange and blue like Blackpool and Cardiff did in the play off final. I'm so proud!
New prey in the PL
Welcome back to Championship in 2024 😅
and i hope something ended with "-ton" also will go down to championship for an exchange
Football is cruel, who comes out this idea for playoffs after hard fought  46 games they lost  I wished Coventry win but anything can happened that's football life
At least give Luton city status now.
Pamberi na Nakamba!!!
Luton has Andrew Tate blessing🤣🤣
everton fan we put luton out of fa cup   semi final i remember ha ha  i was there
It is amazing what Luton have done i wanted to see Gyokeres in the prem but hopefully a prem team signs him but now we get to see Pelly Rudock Mpanzu in the prem he has went up 4 divisions. congrats Luton
A stadium capacity of 10,000? That makes Premiership survival imposible. Nailed on relegation next season..
Nice👍
Terrible club, even worse fans. I have my reasons!!
I could see Dabo on the bench not looking positive.  Rip up his contract and get rid of him.   He cost Coventry a place in the biggest league.
Nakamba Nakamba
Do journalists get a bonus for every time they state the obvious fact that Premier League clubs will visit Luton's Premier League ground?  Have a brain cell, for goodness sake.  You're all boring everybody about it.
Their stadium in the PL is about to be funny to see. Amazing achievement
He stil say man united.. that the big club 😊 not city hahaha
Cant imagine teams like Liverpool Man City going up against Luton 😂
Welcome to Epl
Be down by Christmas, that ground is conference level
Well done Luton town 😮 Hopefully they can stay up next season 😊
Congratulations for The Luton 🤗.
It was better losing this way than losing to a Panzo Maguire blander, that would have hurt.
Strange that he went so wide.
L Town On The Map💯💯💨💨
Supporting Luton next year.
Bournemouth and Brentford are no longer the smallest clubs in the PL. Actually Bournemouth no longer have the smallest ground 😂
Congratulations Luton Town. Welcome to the PL👏👏👏
Welcome to the premier league luton,u have been out the top flight for far to long,hope we get to play your team,from an everton fan.🎉🎉🎉🎉
From non league to premier league. What an amazing story for Luton Town FC
Wow, fair play to both teams man, never would have predicted either of them to come up this season!
I wish it was coventry
Challenge unlocked for Luton can they get 10 points 😂😂
😂
little tinpot micky mouse club like them in the prem lol
Luton town from loosing to York city to Prem
Congrats to Luton! It will be a miracle if they win 5 games next year.
Imagine if the FA doesn’t allow them to play in luton, let them play at Wembley stadium 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤷🏻‍♂️
The match commentator picked Manchester United coming to Lutun , not any other club
Triumph and disaster all in one moment.
Honestly as a CCFC supporter, you deserved the win. 3 disallowed goals and a loss would have been extremely annoying
And then thay will go down again thay won't last
The best thing from non league to the Premier league
Welcome back 😃
Congratulations on the promotion. Unless a lot changes, it won't last long sadly.
Coventry>Luton unlucky today boys
Can’t wait to see them get relegated next season 🤣🤣
I remember back in fifa 16 when I always chose the for career mode😢
Nathan Jones (ex head coach)would be proud of the Luton Town players today since they got promoted to the premiership.
I felt so bad for the coventry player dno his name but seen how devastated he was poor guy
He is definitely gonna racist abuse
LUTON ☠
Wow incredible..so glad to see Luton back in the big time..i remember watching them from old div 1 to the conference..well done lads
it'll be Newcastle they'll be saying soon not tottenham
I got to say mad respect to Luton. Club has had it really rough. From a Wimbledon fan 💛💙🧡
Happy for Nakamba
Who ever plays luton first next season, im triple captaining the opposition 😂
Absolutely pathetic that a team with an arena with capacity of 10 000 are going to play in the Premier league. Well it’s only for 1 season I hope.
Well Done !
Wait who?
Congrats
They deserve the promo 2 season on row
Top G
Congratulations Luton on getting promoted to the premier league l hope you can stay up and have a great season next year ( l also hope lockyer is doing ok it’s awful what happened to l hope he is doing ok right now and has a speedy recovery)
Well done Luton!Get well soon Tom.UTG!
a real dabolical penalty! COYH EII EII EII OHH!!
It's always a brother who misses the crucial penalty 😂😂😂.  Why Dabo, why? 😂😂😂
Joes goal was not a handball anyway
Congrats to Luton and commiserations to Coventry supporters. In the end, 3rd place actually went up. Welcome to the Premiership Luton Town! 👏👏👏
my grandad has been a fan of coventry his whole life sad to see them lose
Congrats Luton Town
easy 6 points next season.
Commentator saying “Manchester United are coming to Kenilworth Road” says it all. The biggest FC bar none 1:03
wow. simply wow
Is Luton a nice place?
Traffic on M1 gona get lot worse
Top G!!!!!
Luton versus Bournemouth,,that should pack them in.
What a story. Congratulations to them
There's still the problem with their stadium. It's not compliant to the standards of the PL and they'll have only 3-4 months to completely renovate it.
Yes, get in there Luton
Mindset is everything, you can't achieve what we have without believing in yourself. 🙌 We deserve it
A girl that used to live near me is Luton's academy administrator!! Justice for Luton as they were relegated from the old First Division in 91/92 just before it became the Prem
ANDREW TATE IS PROUD 🤩
We don't need feel the same love we need feel the same pain. Gotta feel for Coventry but Luton deserved it finished 3rd and were better on the day
My immediate reaction is honestly my heart going out to the player who missed his pen poor poor guy
“Manchester United will be coming to Kenilworth Road” we will be there !!👌Congrats Luton!!🥳🥳
Penalty shoot outs in 2nd tier playoff finals are painful to watch as a neutral but excruciating for supporters. 2002 still haunts me. Congrats to Luton and unlucky Coventry.
Well done Lutron from Middlesbrough fan
Well done Luton, Sunderland 💪🏻
Black players can’t hack pens I have noticed
Guaranteed 6 points against Chelsea at least. Congrats Luton!
My hometown club in the premier league.. lets gooooo 🧡🧡🧡
It's. Great. To. Have. You. Back. In. The. Big. Time. If. Bournemouth. Can. Hack. It. I. Think. You. Can. Too.   From. Leicester. Fan.  Good. On. Yer
"Manchester United are coming.." When you are big, you are Manchester United big. Kudos, Luton Town, what an incredible story!
What's the song when they lift the trophy on the pitch?
I wonder what their stadium looks like
It's quite incredible for a club like Luton Town, from being in National League in 2013-14, to being in the Prem next season! Kudos to everyone involved in the club's journey back up to the Prem, after 31 years.
I think they'll struggle...the difference between Championship and PL life is harshly vast, but hope they do well.
Congratulations @ Luton Town
Hats off to the luton players that went to console the Coventry players ,a heartbreaking way to end
31 years waited for that
Showing commiserations straight away to the opposing team instead of celebrating in their faces shows true class - hats off to that blonde lad for Luton.
Can Lutons stadium even be in the premier league a lot of their facilities are non league quality.
There’s not much faith in the club with the stadium that only holds 10,000
Eric Morecambe looking down with a big smile on his face
I Predicted Luton Town to Win today
Imagine your team playing there at 3 oclock on saturday will actually cry no chance of seeing them
W
Luton town deserve to win because that is foolish them was a third place and of to playoff
Congrats Luton  I’m very sad as a coventry fan. Practice makes perfect Play up sky blues Hopefully next year!
Well at least one team will be below Spurs next season
Commiserations to Coventry. Consolation, two absolutely huge clubs are coming down tomorrow.
Everyone outside of Coventry wanted luton to win. Coventry wont get this close again. 😂
I never thought I would have to dig out my Luton Town Scarf!  I was stationed in England in the USAF '77 to '86 and fell in love with real Football!  Used to go to 70 or so matches a year and I would buy a Home Scarf at every Ground I visited .... I have 48 Scarves!  So I guess they would be considered "Vintage"! .... Can't wait to see how they'll do!
gonna be relegated straight away
Damn, at one time they were in the Conference! 😮
Come on Luton
Remember only one team could have got promoted from play offs. I reckon Coventry will be up there again next year and qualify. As for luton i see a new Brentford team in them. Keep up the great work luton
what a story
Luton bout to get 19 points and drop straight back down lmao
luton mallus like adi
lmao I cant imagine haaland having to go through someones backyard to play football
Orange in the prem
No matter the opposition, I always feel so bad for the losers
Marvelous Nakamba❤❤❤❤
1:03 they never can not stop mentioning us
I remember the days of Lars Elstrup and the plastic pitch.
Serieusly am happy for Luton I've been watching those play off and they truly deserve it
heroes & villains when it gets to pens, hope dabo knows it could have happened to any player, congrats luton 👏
Now they got sign better players coz premier league ain’t kids play,congrats LUTON FC
Fankaty Dabo is gonna get (if he hasn't already received) racist abuse for missing isn't he, look forward to that inevitable story, Sky!
yesaya nakamba
From Conference League in 2014 to Premier League in 2023. Congratulations to the Hatters! Big up Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu for sticking with the club all the way through and Rob Edwards for taking Watford's biggest enemy to the PL after being one of many sacked by the Pozzos.
its kl how the stadium has half colours
No white left to take a penalty kick ? 🤔
6 points guaranteed for Pep.
where are the actual highlights?
david bowie heros playing was wow
Manchester United are coming. That says a lot! Not City 😂
Am proud of nakamba
IG we gonna see haaland in someone backyard then 💀
Thoughts go to Dabo, hope his career gets back on track next season. Many players are never the same after a shocker like that.
COYH
Congratulations guys
all of Lutons players have just become millionaires !
Interesting fact; Luton Town were last in the 'big time' in 1991/92 the last year of the old First Division and got relegated in 20th place (out of 22) just escaping relegation by 2 points in 19th place was - Coventry City.  Karma?
A blueprint for Wrexham? Non-league and all the way back up. Don't want to be a party pooper but one of the reasons they were in the top flight and stayed there previously was that awful artificial pitch they had. Other teams couldn't get to grips with it.
I blame dabo
Congratulations, respect Luton Town FC 👏
Golden goal and no penalties is the way forward.  Far too traumatic for the person who misses.
Terrific achievement. Welcome to the big time, Luton. Forest fan here... we'll see you at the City ground!
well don loo town
This moment will go down in history. Congrats to Luton, didn't really follow the championship much but insane and sounded like a great season all round. Gonna be some proper grass-roots, had fought football next season and some upsets for sure. Good luck next season Luton and the fans!! Go show those big teams you don't need money to be successful.
Can’t wait to see halland playing in someone’s backyard
I Only Watch Thises Beautiful Team . From The 2018 Video Back Than . But Now Ever Since The First Divison Now The English Premier League . The Luton Hatters Town Are Going Back To The Top Were They Belong Too . With The Orinigal 6 Club . Who Are Dominating The Promotion Ever Since . The Blackburn Team . 92-93 . Now The Hatters Luton Town Are Back Home Where They Belong Too . Congratulations The Hatters Luton Town 🎩👒⚽ .
Congrats Luton Town what a story their club has being promoted all the way from down to the top ! Win for football 🔥
Congratulations Luton!... just get ready for the prem life. Once the season starts nobody will have any interest in you. Top 6 bias is rife. Even if you're on sky playing against Villa or Fulham the show will mostly be Neville and Carragher talking about Man Utd and Liverpool. Enjoy the ride but it is a very elitist and toxic environment.
What a huge stadium for a championship club
Hahahahaha too bad Cov, back to the Championship you go, UTV!
Kenilworth Road as a PL stadium! madness for some peoples back yards hahaha fair play tho!
Straight back to championship next year
When naming all the clubs you just could'nt give the toon a mention could you😡
Dabo's walk-up showed a man who had ZERO confidence of netting his penalty.
Dabo , God bless you! Don't cry. Coventry City is a great team. Congrats to Luton Town!
congratulation LUTON
Congratulations Luton welcome to the prem 👍🏻👍🏻
Future premier league relegation prospect 😊
I would have been happy to see Coventry back as well... Similar to Luton, they've had an extremely tough few years.
Goodbye Coventry from Birmingham City. Don’t come creeping to borrow a ground again. We don’t want you 😂😂😂😂
Well done Luton...both teams battled throughout this season. Welcome to the big time🎉
My home town club and what a great game. Coventry played so well and I hope they go up next year! Looking forward to Luton vs Liverpool.
BOOM 💥
Can’t wait for Haaland to match this years goal tally in 1 game against Luton next year
I have never heard of this club
big question where will they play there home games
Man said they are back 😅 0:30
Enjoy playing at Milton Keynes next season!! 🤣
They need to upgrade that 10000 capacity
😮 in 2013, Luton was in 5th tier of english league. I remember picking Luton in Championship Manager around that time as a challenge bringing them to EPL. Wow.. it comes true!! Congrats
The spectrum of emotions from one end to another. Football is truly a Cruel Game. Both teams gave everything but one has to be on the losing end.😢
Unbelievable well done luton crazy UP THE BLADES
Wow, well done Luton, feel sad for Coventry worst way to lose but what a story for Luton town 👍
back down next season but well done
Congratulations luton, cant wait to smash you 5 or 6-0 next season.
Shame they don’t have a stadium to match the achievement
Congratulations Luton! See you in the Prem UTB ⚔️
To think Watford sacked Rob Edwards only so he could taken Luton to the Premier League.
Down the hat before the Hatters!
cant believe it
Tbh I wish a white coventry fc player had missed.... With all the racism, damn😢😢😢
They gonna go back to championship next year
The new derby county  I forsee a 2 wins season with 10 points from 38 games and 32 losses
Best Club in England
Will they allow away fans in as last time in the top flight they banned away fans
This is why football is so beautiful, what an incredible story.  Every now and again a true underdog story emerges.  Congratulations 🎉
For stories like this, is that the Premier League is the NUMBER ONE FOOTBALL LEAGUE in the world! Congrats Luton, it will be a pleasure to see the Manchester United playing in your stadium.
Premiership = Farmers league well done Luton well done 👏
They finished 3rd and were the most consistent team. Therefore they deserve promotion.
Can't wait to see luton play in the premier League...
Total respect to Luton from a Gooner
I never expected to get in to the premiere league!  🧡👒 Coventry Done well! 👏
But what about that stand that needs reconstruction in the Prem, the area for cameramen/camerawomen to record, the amount of seats in the stadium and all the other things about Kenilworth Road?
Excellent!!
The dives will be sussed in the prem league .6 points for every team .
Crappest premier league stadium in history.
ManchesterUnited: we will be there
Huddersfield Town fan here congratulations really consistent last two seasons really deserve it good luck going forward
Still the farmers league and always will be.
COYH
From non league to top super league brilliant Fair play Luton 👌👍🍀
May as well have a year off and just give 6 points to every team 🤣 They'll be worse than Sunderland in THAT season.  100 quid now says they get less than 10 points 🤣
This is nothing but 6 free points home nd away for City, Arsenal,Man united, Newcastle and Liverpool
Luton should ask mk Dons to stadium share cause Luton's stadium is not premier League worthy
Can’t wait for away days at Luton 😂😂😂😂
Top Gs hometown
Should never cry in defeat, only in victory.
Luton is an absolute dump. Not sure if that's relevant to the football team but I felt to remind everyone anyway.
Women snuck in spurs like we wouldn’t notice. Gotta respect the effort.
Coventry next year
DT entered the chat
Both teams would have deserved this after their years of suffering. Hope Coventry gain promotion next season.
I feel sorry for the losers, but good luck in the premiership, Luton.
nah if any of the big 6 lose to luton town🤣
ethan horvath is now usa's number 1 keeper
So happy for them and I’m not even from Luton but been watching them whole Season
You should hear the streets of Luton 🚗
Amazing story! Now let’s hope that Leicester stays up!🙏🏻
Still can’t believe Haaland, De Bruyne, Salah, Casemiro, Saka, Kane, Enzo and many more will be playing away in Luton next season! Crazy! Congratulations Luton Town!
Im a City fan who lives in Luton and I wanted em to win so badly COME ON U HATTERS THE TOWN IS WITH U
2008/09, Luton and Bournemouth sit in the relegation zone of League 2, both with a minus points deduction (-30, -17). 2023/24, they are both in the Premier League. Not bad going in 15 years
That's a horrible way to loose, but a great way to win!
Sympathy for Dabo, awful way to lose a game with so much at stake.
The last time Luton were in the top teir, they still had their plastic pitch, didn't they?
I remember Luton beating Liverpool 3-0 back in 85 or 86 and that's the last game that stood out until the wilderness set in.
The beautiful game, two extremely different emotions in a second.
Only to be relegated the next season.
Congrats Luton Town, what a story it's been for ur club! As for Coventry, chin up and be proud of the progress ur club has made ❤.  There's always next season.
COYH!
Irish guy is buzzing rn
Congratulations Luton
Coventry kunt string two passes together
Massive congratulations to Luton Town! I wanted you to get promoted from the beginning and what a journey over the last 9 years! Well done!
Congrats to Luton town from a city fan. Don’t just play to defend a draw.. play good football to win or at least try and you’ll do well
Congratulations to Luton. Can’t wait to try get my away tickets to this stadium of 50 allocation 😅
I feel bad for the guy who missed the pen. But feel happy for luton to be in the premier league for the first time in its history
KENNILWORTH ROAD IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE, DIDNT WANT COV TO WIN JUST FOR THAT.
Remember when Bonchu Guenchev played for Luton.
Shows what can happen at a club when its run right.
First time ever ?
hang on luton in the premiership wow jesus cant wait wait for them to lose 10 nil to city next season
Two grounds in the Prem with about 11K capacity. Bournemouth and Luton.
The best manager in the world is crying lol Nathan Jones u bum u shoud of waited
WELCOME!
Andrew Tate will be proud ✊
manchester is still RED!!!! that is why the commentator emphasise manchester united will be coming
Watch Luton bring back that plastic pitch, they'll be down by Christmas.
Kenilworth road in the Premier League 🤣
Forget Wrexham, Luton is the epic story!
It's only fair that Luton Town gets promoted..I mean they were miles ahead on points anyway...hard luck Coventry...try to make it  without the playoffs next season
Congratulations to Luton on their way back to the Premier league. Sad for Coventry  who have had a torrid time for the last 20 years. Footballers a cruel sport.
Must be weird for Nathan Jones. Set Luton up for promotion from League One in 2019, left for Stoke in January, it was a disaster, Luton go up. This season he left in November with them well placed, left for Southampton, it was a disaster, Luton go up.
“It tastes like promotion!”
They'll go straight back down. No chance staying up
As soon as he mentioned Chelsea I know the guy would miss
Less than 11 thousand seats?
Will want to see Coventry promoted next year 👌🏽👌🏽
Amazon you need to do documentary on Luton in the premier league next season!
Did you know that on Boxing day, 1963 Karou Mitoma entered Luton Town's Ground, where he went to University to study dribbling, where he Joined Will Still's Reims on a 19 game unbeaten run where he was fined 22K every game because he didn't have his UEFA Pro licences?
Nice to see someone different in the premier League well done Luton
Away fans are gonna find it funny playing at Luton 😂
I'm happy for Ethan Horvath in particular. He deserves it.
For gods sake stop quoting the "old" top six what about Newcastle?
oh wow. Congrats to Luton. Amazing story.
Congratulations...they need to buy quality players
Rob Edwards has been fantastic  choice for Luton just hope the stadium can be made ready in time now good luck luton
Congrats Luton, look forward to seeing you next season ☺
I used to watch Luton in the 70s when they were top tier.  They sunk to the 'National' and got trapped there, and now they are back up to top tier.  Not a Luton supporter (I support Stevenage, 'Who?') , but I am so pleased for this club.  Wish them success in the premier league..  For a club on a 'low' budget (well compared to the big guys), let them be an example.  Big money is not always related to success.
Seeing the rise of Luton in such a short amount of time gives me hope as a Plymouth fan.
Non-League to premier League is impressive, but Jay from Inbetweeners went from non-League to champions League in 5 years... Beat that!!
Luton may have won the play off but will the PL allow them to use Kennilworth Road as the facilities aren't up to scratch??
time to find 3.8m fpl player😁
Result for next season Man City 17-0 Luton Town
This is what football is all about, fairytale like stories, love it.
Imagine losing on pens for a promotion to the prem.  Football is not friendly sometimes.
I remember the days when Luton were playing in the Blue Square PL. This is incredible. Erling Haaland playing in Bury Park 😂 can't wait to see it.
Congratulations Luton 👏👏👏
Imagine the Super League got accepted that year or so back. We would miss out on things like this. Congratulations Luton! Wishing you all the success in the world for the Premier League next season 👏
An amazing roller coaster ride by Luton Town congratulations to them
Both teams should be proud, only one can win. Respect to both sides
Fans of the 'top 6' crying about Luton stadium are also the ones who never go to games, a real stadium coming to the prem
As a Arsenal fan I can’t wait to see these guys get promoted 🙌🏽❤️
congrats to luton cant wait to see them in the pl
Triple cap incoming 😊
Haaland will cook
YESSSSSSS 🧡🆙
1:07 i mean why Manchester United 😭
Well done luton town you fully deserve it carlton Morris has been magnificent for you brilliant achievement from a barnsley fan
Coventry is a very racist place. Hopefully the black player doesn't get racism thrown at him for missing the pen.
Well done Luton. What a journey. Commiserations to Coventry. I hope they are back in the race for promotion again.
next season you guys will get relegated have fun. Please don't mad and argue at me because that's a reality of it. Enjoy while you can for a year. At least beat some big club example: Brentford, and Brighton have make impact on PL because of that. Btw break a leg.
It must be heartbreaking.. you have to play 60 games a season consistently only to lose on penalties and do it all over again
All congradulations go to Luton Town, who ever thought that a team like them can ever do this. One of the greatest stories in English football, hope them all the best for the Premier League. 👒👒👒🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠 Hats of for Luton indeed 👏👏
I always without question root for the team that finished top of the play-off places, so I'm happy.
Welcome to the PL Luton 🎩🎩
it is a bizarre achievement, Luton Town just not even 10 years ago played in Conference national league, its a real-life Football Manager club, well game over now, I mean there is not a single chance Luton stays in PL after the next season, basically guaranteeing relegation for this bizarre club :)
Not a Luton fan but what a moment. Up the hatters🧡
They gonna get relegated STRAIGHT away
Congratulations to Luton!! So amazing to finally see someone other then a yo-yo club come to the Prem. but wow! Their stadium holds less then Wrexham 😅
I feel sorry for Coventry  But Luton Town Fc Is my Life.
Hahaha, cannot wait to smash Luton next season.
Luton Town? It was like 40 years ago I last heard their name 🤗♥️😎😋🥰
Well done Luton   For sale.. Sky Blue flag, emblazoned with the slogan "well be back" waved every season to no avail, no reason for further use.  Contact Jimmy Hill, Ricoh Stadium, Coventry.
Fankaty Dabo running down the wing, Dabo, hear the City sing, we are going Premier League 🩵
Congratulations to Rob Edwards and Luton Town. Hope ye stay up next year. Already booking flights for Fulham V Luton
Imagine sky sports tv interviewers talking to pep in someones backyard
I give my wholehearted congratulations to Luton Town FC, They have been brilliant and deserve to have a go at the big time! So here’s good luck to Luton Town! Off to compete with the big dogs now!
Coventry kit is like man city's kits from early 2000
Nakamba
Congrats Luton! Shame for Coventry such a cruel way to lose. I hope they bounce back next season
Imagine the lush fans with their fancy stadiums coming to a luton game
Luton's gonna get smoked in the premier league😂😂
wait a minute where were all these normal people  when i visited Luton a few years ago, all i saw was Paki & Indian people everywhere i went,  very dangerous & creepy place especially at night
Luton Town Promoted......
What happens with the stadium situation?
Absolutely brilliant to have Luton in the premier.  When I was a kid they were a div 1 staple so happy for them. What a journey just incredible.
watford fans are in tears lol
Respect to Luton
Luton FC = Barcelona  Luton Town High St= Baghdad
Congratulations Luton. I don't see them surviving in PL
Congratulations Luton ….the premier league has missed the artificial pitch so much 🙂
“Manchester United coming to kenilworth road” only game that matters. Buy that city.
Amazing! Both clubs have amazing stories, but, as a Wealdstone fan, the idea of us being in the Premier League in 9 years is ridiculous! Our structure of football in this country is amazing.
Congratulations Luton Town  What a journey 👏🏻
let's hope the houses get reinforced with the best protection ever! especially with the likes of haaland and Kane and much more in the prem, even though 99% of the time haalands will just end up in the back of the net... and for the commentator mentioning "manchester united" don't worry they aint even a threat they lost relevancy in 2012 luton will smash them
COYH!!
I am slightly worries that the cost of bringing the ground up to PL levels or moving might outweight the significant income increase, THIS is what makes the english football league the best
City fans won't even fill the stadium
I wanted to see the highlights.
Luton town….. BRING ON THE SMOKE
They absolutely deserved it, congrats to Luton
yes, i had belief and i knew they could do it
Congrats luton town welcome to the holy grail for your club stay here for few years will set you up financially
Luton for the First Time Well done from spurs fan
So happy for Rob Edwards after what Watford did to him.
Holy FK wow congrats to Luton town.  I remember the days of John Hartson and also David Pleat.  Big up to Luton Town and Enjoy the ride in the Premiere league (Peace form a Newcastle Fan)
Congratulations luton town, see you in the Premier league from a brighton fan 🎉
As a Bournemouth fan🍒 I’m glad we will now have the second smallest stadium in the league next season 😅😅
Luton Town is officially the smallest PL club in history! This is a historic moment in Luton's history! We'll see you soon Luton!
Theirs no words
They deserve it after finishing 3rd in the championship, automatic promotion I prefer but it's all about money now, what was that advert back in the day, Lorraine Chase was in it 🤔 oh ya Camparie and Leamon (1979), Lorraine Chase use to say "Nah, Luton Airport!". Are we going to hear this all next season 🤣🤣
devastated for coventry, but happy for luton. what a final though, it had everything, you couldnt write a better story. glad lockyers alright
Beautiful achievement by Luton, the place where i was born. Once in a lifetime scenes, ref was a bit biased though.   ...Read more
Well done Luton!! Looking forward to having you in the Prem next season! x Man Utd fan
The ending we all wanted poor Dabo though hope he pushes through
My Hometown is promoted  Congrats Luton!
The most expensive football match, well done Luton, heartbreak for  Coventry. Love this beautiful game.!!!!
Isn't their ground entrance just a terraced house? 😂😂
HUUUH ? LUTON ? IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ?!?! THE MATRIX HAS SNAPPED
Well that’s going to be 6 points for Utd 😂😂😂
MattSB what happened
The Coventry No mark can join sancho, Saka and Rashford for missing a Wembley pen. 😂
are they gonna be allowed to play in that small ground in the PL? isn't it too small.
going straight down fun to visit tho Luton
Did she seriously mention Spurs? Instant 3 points for Luton next season!
Enjoy it while it lasts your be going straight back down again 😂
As an Arsenal fan living in Luton, seeing us win on the big screen in a park, I went absolutely livid with the crowd. I cried at how this small depressing-town with a stadium that has a entrance in someone's backyard has somehow made it to the premier league, setting a few English records. Can't wait to be at Kenilworth Road watching Luton play clubs like Arsenal, city, united and more. The Hatters have pulled off arguably the greatest feat in English footballing. 🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩
Dabo will remember this day very bitterly. Heal soon fella
The cruelest way to lose but the sweetest way to win
Where will Luton play their home games…..? Given their ground not complying with Premier League rules…..
Wait a minute, Luton in the premier league, the last time I remembered they were in league two....how come 😮
and the great news is the captain is awake and responding to people thank you god for saving this man, and well done Luton Town what a story and what a dream well done
Luton will play at mk dons stadium
Wolves in peace. Congratulations on your promotion. I remember it was only 10 years ago when you were in the National League and knocked us out of the FA Cup. Looking forward to seeing you next season,good luck.
Feel sorry for any away fans that travel to Luton, a absolute dump of a ground
Congrats to Luton Town, it very historic Achievement for Edwards and boys. i cant wait Leeds,Leicester or Everton playing with them next season  went from non league 10 years ago to go back to Premier League  see you next season in premier league from Benfica Supporter
Can't wait to see haaland playing in someones backyard
Luton town um small stadium coming to premier League
Well done 👍
Best spend millions in their training ground and stadium it’s a right shite hole, congrats Luton 🎉🎉
The best team won and well deserved, it should have been done and dusted by half time for Luton, well done - justice was delivered
Hard luck on Coventry
They finished 3rd even so 👍
Imagine Man City fans going through someone’s back garden to enter a stadium 😂😂
Ok, now the whole Coventry team is leaving for 23-24
can't wait to go into this stadium they have
And relegated back again this time next year
congratulations Luton...happy for Nakamba .💕💕❤️❤️all the way from Zimbabwe 🇿🇼
I feel bad for all the away fans that have to travel to that absolute shithole of a town next season. My greatest ever memory of Luton is when my plane took off and I could officially say I was no longer in Luton.
Man City can't handle our bus tracks
Feels so strange to see Luton going up while Leicester most securely going down. But congrats
What a story, national league to premier league, Kenilworth Road is gonna be rocking next season, well done Luton!
That stadium in the prem is gonna be halarious and beautiful.
They need to spend big to stay up. No point spending a bit and then getting relegated.
Ecstatic atmosphere, unbelievable
What I was hoping for!  Congrats Luton, great team! 🎉  Unlucky Coventry, you'll do it next time.
Brilliant from Luton Town,From Non-League football to the top flight!
Eric Morecambe would have loved this!!! 🍾😎
Imagine that Stadium in The Premier League
Just wait for Premier League matches to happen at their stadium!!
Absolute fairytale! From Conference to the Prem! Congratulations Luton!  See you next season from a Chelsea supporter!
They'll probably get relegated, unless they bring back their plastic pitch in which case it might make them awkward to play against and give them significant home advantage.
Gyokeres 🔥🔥🔥
What a game 🔥 congrats Luton well deserved
The cruelest way to lose, the sweetest way to win.
Ok      😊
First
Congratulations
Big up
Epic rise 🔥🔥 Congratulations Luton!
