Awesome music video

😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love Serj Tankian but I am extremely disappointed by his silence on Gaza. Sometimes, silence is louder than anything you could have said. And the man knows what is happening. Why! If you want people to care about the Armenian Genocide & the attacks on Armenians living in Artsakh today, then you have to link it to the really big genocide that’s happening before us all.
Stop the genocide . Peace no war , Syetem Of a Down & still 🇵🇸 ✌🏼🍉 1:23
STOP THE WAR!!!
zooming out from Armenia at the end is the chef's kiss to this video!
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Just yes, yes, yes.....purrfect
Armenian Christians getting genocided by Turkish Muslims; funny how that's been glossed over by supposed fans
Palestine? Palestine 🇵🇸🫡
New System of a Down song about a cursed wish to the loss of a dream.
For all System of a Down fans who want to bridge the wait until the next System of a Down concert, I have a cool System of a Down playlist called I|I 🔪 System of a Down 🗡 I|I
SOAD literally the ADHD of music
Dear friends,  The Devil has a name .... and will be deafeted for all humanity crimes. please remain patient and hopeful — the day will come when those responsible for the genocides against our people will be held to account. The name of this wrongdoer is known. The destruction of peoples, the distortion of their histories, and ongoing expansionist policies are among the gravest injustices — yet we do not forget. Salute from Greece to all Armenian brothers & sisters.  p.s. Serj, Daron, Shavo, John i hope one day to see you here for a concert here in Greece, but for now thankfull to God cause i book a ticket for Milano :P

20 years ago, I went in a small village in Armenia to work as a volunteer on an archeological site (I'm French). I had the choice to go to many countries but I made up my mind because I loved (and still love) SOAD so much. It was the most beautiful trip of my life. Despite Armenian's liveliness, I was feeling their pain and the ghosts of the genocide when I would speak to them about it (when it was not too painful to them) and when I would listen to traditional songs, especially the ones played by the master Djivan Gasparyan and his the beautifully haunting duduk melodies.  20 years later on, and still no recognition of the genocide...  SOAD has made so much to pay tribute to their country and make its history largely known to the outer world (even though it should be known without them), while at the same time speaking about their lives in modern America.  The blend between metal and Armenian influences is what makes SOAD, Scars on Broadway or Serj's solo projects such great bands.  Armenia will be in my heart forever, long live Armenia !!❤ And long live melting-pot societies, at a time when too many countries want to close their frontiers and shut themselves away.
vcs tem que lancar mais musicas vcs sao foda.
Aint no way the creator of skibidi toilet is a soad fan

We need this song now more than ever
The war is over!!! ❤
Please make the New album 🔥🔥🔥🔥
What I would do for a full album. 😭
This song and protect the land are both epic and tick all the soad boxes! this should have led to a soad album, and its sad to see no full album, after two, great tracks.  on a separate note Trump and starmer are both terrorists. SOAD Forever. Power to humanity ❤
we need another soad album
Bro they look so old 😢😢😢😢😢 im sad they old
🤘👍👍🤘
its crazy that separated these two singers making their kwn albums still are popular... but then the first song they put out in years together has more views than a couple of their songs each combined... come back system!
They need more music, not because we want it, because we need it, these guys are the definition of inspiring

Lost interest with the new start map and new quests that fallowed. To be a player who was playing before the first wipe constantly every wipe that one got me to quit, im fucking done getting mad at a video game. The non stop dying zero survival rate that was that new map got me done. I was a survive 10 raids kinda rat and not even i couldnt keep alive
This is great. It sounds like a perfect mix between their self titled and mesmerize albums
music is great but this idiots always yapping about this thing.
Os caras sao fodas 🤟
Anyone here after reading Serj's book, knowing he was given little if any chance to play with this song or how he sung it?
is this describing what's happening in G and A and Z and A
War sucks but without it we wouldn't have SOAD so 🤷‍♂️
So much death and genocide , these days, right on our screens. Unfortunately, SOAD is timeless.
it's july 2025 and this clip still makes me emotional
❤ enak di dengar lagu nya❤❤❤
Wow they made a song about Israel! Thanks SOAD🥰

Why not change the band name if all have evolved practically separate. System of An Up ha
So glad they are back in 2025! Looking forward to catching these guys in concert. One of the best parts of my childhood!!
You're all know who's the demons now..
Coming across this video just two days before seeing this incredible band live is an entirely different sensation. A band that, as a teenager, felt so out of reach like one of those legendary groups you'd never have the chance to witness. Now, just two days away from the concert of my life, it feels surreal.
Totally obsessed with the drum blasting ❤❤
Man we need them back 100% wish we could get even more music but it's the way she goes
Pq botaram o Marcos Mion pra cantar?
Aka Zionists
Omg! goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love you guys so much ❤
change some colors and we got the fight of ukraine fighting russia i know the song back then was intended on another fight, but it was accounted "generaly" , so for me the band accounted any fights against "minorities 2 and to fight back   slava ukrania 💙💛
They killed innocent Armenians
Lol they have gotten more fast at using the instruments
🤘🤘🤘❤️❤️❤️🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
1:10 this part hits

We need a new system in our life now days and it sure isn't this... (which has been what it is, but could be worse)
the new regime in syria committed genocide and cleansing of christians and other muslims on march 6-7 2025 with the support of the european union, I immediately remembered this clip
Curtindo muito em 2025 para desestressar.
Some people have asked for the Devil, they have chosen for donald trump
Excellent rock and metal radio station. Google it: "shogun rocks laut"  Have fun!!!!!!
Who's here in 2025?
Pedraaaaaadaaaa!!! 🔥🔥🔥
This is obviously about P****stine and Is***l isnt it? Beautiful
"Teaching warfare to their children" might be one of the hardest lines in all of music.
🔥🔥🤘👀🤘🔥🔥
Fucking legends. as always
This goes hard ASFF
SOAD, a heavy band that says “we never summon the devil”
Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

1:38 "Teaching warfare to their children" and "Guess who's coming over to dinner" gives me the best feeling of chills

This song is a masterpiece❤
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!  They still got it!
Tge world needs a new soad album because of this single
KHOJALY GENOCIDE RECOGNITION
propaganda but banger
I just hope they can actually make it through this tour. Already bought tickets for the NJ show in August.
They had huge Turkish fanbase back in 2001-2003 that era (they still have a fanbase but we are older now lol) and we never understand the Armenian hate. they would love it if they ever visit Turkiye. We don't hate armenians but they hate us. There's armenians living in Istanbul, they have their own churches, schools etc. They should come and visit. No need to spread hate.
Ya 3 años!? 😧

I love the serjetivity in the music of Soad and Serj Tankian ❤

Daron Malakian doing the most to keep SOAD alive.. ❤️
Best moment 1:10

this is so sick, i will absolutely use this once i compiled all my firefighting videos.
You're just fucking stupid. No one of will be successful on their own. It's what made you unique. To be a band together. You will never hit anything like this being solo. You're just stupid.
Genocidal Zionists ;p
and they are so strong they must be 3 against a child...
One of my favorite soad songs
Texas not getting overtime pay free from taxes! 💩

It's unfortunate you guys don't want to make any more new music.Cause this was really good stuff.And this was only from like three years ago
After such a long time, this is such a good song... How can you get not over your grief. This is what you are.
It's sad to see this band doesn't make more music. I understand why. But it's the loss for all of us.

System of a Down and Rage Against the Machine are both in need of one more album each. Especially now.
Sector GAZA!
In 05, I was only 8 years old at the time. System of a Down was the first metal band that I started listening to, in facts they’re the reason why I got into metal. I was bummed that they split up shortly after. Now at nearly 29 years old, I feel that they still got it.
❤💙🧡 👍👍👍
You know shit's real when SOAD is angry. We need an album.
Inspirational and rockin'.

I was in san fran this year. Watching you guys play live forever changed my life. Not to mention these lyrics are just perfect
Great song, great band!
🇵🇸🇵🇸
The song can also easily apply to Serbian government and their denial of the Bosnian genocide.
You see all my nation as genocidal humanoidz ha?
One of a kind. Unreached, unmatched.
I appreciate their principled nature. Would I have liked more S.O.A.D. over the years? Of course, but they decided to use their talents to say something instead of just milking their name and fame for money. I respect that. But the trade off for a lack of content from them, is that what they do release is always high quality and has a much deeper meaning than others in their line if work. I hope they don't ever change and keep fighting for what they believe in.
top 10 system song imo
brutalisimo
why do they hate each other again?
wait so they came out with one song 3 years ago and i just saw it>?
fuck ! that was so good
Im not here for the video, im here to politely request ANOTHER F'ING ALBUM COME ON GUYS IVE GROWN CHEST HAIRS AND MORE WAITING FOR THIS
i'll buy an 4K TV to watch this masterpiece

For those who are struggling to say the fast part they say in the song just use this comment as a guide. Heres what to say:  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never (They only do that last part a few times)   Follow this and youll get it in no time! 😊
We need another self titled album!

This song for our brother and sister in palestine.. freedom for palestine!!!!
I love all system albums and serjis older stuff. But honestly this sounds like crap.
Si estuviera Cornell + Vader sería mi harem! 😂😂
This sounds so much like late stage SOAD. It's crazy to think that it's almost 20 years after Mesmerize/Hypnotize days
"Teaching warfare to their children The bastards that will be destroyed"  Free Palestine from Hamas🇮🇱
Hey guys im one of your new fans I recently started listening to your old stuff and you guys still got it love your 2 new song 💜💋
Hey guys im one of your new fans I recently started listening to your old stuff and you guys still got it love your 2 new song 💜💋
And GENOCIDE is happening again now, before the eyes of the world and the world is silent except for the demonstrators
Vuelvan csm :'vvv
The fact that i got a joe biden ad on this is extremely ironic
I see Daron spelled humanoids with a z to make it cooler
Yesss !!!

пора им между собой окончательно помириться и наконец поделить деньги за концерты и собраться и писать новую музыку, старые не старые, но талантливые, которые создали потрясающую музыку на несколько поколений, эти 4 парня для большинства просто идеальная рок группа!!!

The devil is hiding himself behind a white flag with a blue star.

I want new system more than i want a future for myself and the people i love.

Please just do one more record
I am only.humanoids haha
всю жизнь система доказывала о геноциде арменского народа по отношению к турции и азербаджану и как сейчас правдивые армяни относяться к откровенному генноциду украинцев от российских захватчиков

Devil isnt a lie. Its Israel
First heard this song at 2 am tripping on THC gummies at my cabin last summer great tune. The world needs SOAD back.
as a Turk, i hate that we are being discriminated by the global powers. Some of them attack some of us, or vice versa for their own,  and whole nationalities become enemies
Killer song!
Damn, since when did war look this cool?
🇵🇸
Still so true. It's like it's the story of humanity (or at least current humanity).
freee pl3stin33333!!!!!!!!!!!
we could cure the world, as if the world would listen
This song is about to become popular in Serbia. Please do a tour through eastern Europe! A F ton of fans are waiting.
We really needed there lyrics in 2020
É minha música favorita
Amazing
1:21 they nailed that like cattle decap vibe right here lol
Serj should be our God. He would lead us all to salvation
0:47 that transition was seamless
Play instruments faster please
Now this is SOAD. Good old SOAD.
1:41 soad the anime lol.
In an interview, Serj talks about the magic of when he and Daron met were the vocal harmonies. And I feel like it's the main reason why Daron or Serj's solo work don't resonate with most people compare to SOAD
May the Palestinians see freedom and peace 🕊️🇵🇸
3 Años Paso Por Esta Canción Buena
I've never really liked system of a down like 100% but I'm not sure why
fucking hell please release more music
try not to say devil for 1 minute challenge *impossible*
como me da en la madre siempre ver las cosas desde la perspectiva de SOAD es muy pinches triste :/
Ok, but how dare they play the blast beat part only once
S.O.A.D. for life
I love SOAD. Even though they cannot get along as musicians, they can still come together when the world needs them, even if only for 2 songs. Absolutely beautiful.
This is what Palestine is going through 😢💔
FROM THE RIVER TO SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE
Ésa canción es bacánasa

I hope the money will not go towards sponsoring and killing the Ukrainian people? Do you feed the system of capitalism, Zelensky and other corrupt officials? I don’t like sponsors of 404 terrorism.
Seeing this in April 2024 is so mindblowing, the war on children , the rubble, the devil, the emotions,, everything is just repeated all over again all over the world by the same devil and perpetrators

idk about real dictators and all, but if SOAD came back after 15 years only to call me out for my bullshit, id stop whatever it is i was doing wrong.
1:20 was hearing the song and MAN, i was caught off guard by this blast beat and the black metal sounding riff, that was insane, never imagined System could put an black/death metal riff into their song and make it fit well 😮
As a proud son of Turkic ethnicity and Turkish nation, I am honored to feared by a bunch of people who are still believes in the same old fairy tale called Armenian Geno*ide...
Sick!
Great message ❤
YES AND MORE YES
Huh, seems like they came back with the same problem as their last two albums, too much Daron on vocals.
توبوا إلى الله لأن بالصلاح والاسلام تحيا النفوس والقلوب وتوبوا لتنجو من الوعيد   .repent to Allah in Islam because by Islam live the hearts and souls and repent to survive from the promise
Ao que ocorre hoje e sempre na palestina...
How do you guys only have 7m subs on youtube? This song is CRAZY! (Although, the flashing lights hurt my eyes badly.)
This whole song screams AOT !!! (Attack on Titan)
They took a break for 14 years , 14!!! And they come back like this, this legit sounds like it could be in hypnotize/mezmorize! Its unreal the talent they have!!
It's true daron

Soda please come back to us we need you more than ever
if john is 50 now, then he was probably 46 or 47 yrs old when they made this, and hes still doing crazy thrash beats, blast beats, and some bits sounded a bit like power metal drumming, and to top that all off his timing is just as good as it was when they started all those years ago. bro is aging like the finest wine known to man
Ya quiero tocar esta canción en guitar hero
I want band System of a down saw my comment: PLS! connect and drop more songs. PLS ;(
Serj will always be in my Top 5 metal/rock vocalist. G.O.A.T🫡🫡
I really wish this song was on a new album of theirs
the part at 1:10 & 1:38 is godly too

This came up on some random playlist and I thought, gee, how did I miss this track 20 years ago? Nope, turns out, they just cranked out a classic SOAD track out of the blue after all this time. The world needs more SOAD…
Whats cool about this is that their lead singer joined the band again after leaving for years. i will say more below
日本に来て欲しいです 2001年の頃のように
Am I the only one that hears this but does the chorus guitar tone sound like gunshots intentionally. So cool
i love you guys
Avevo 6 anni quando nel 2001 mio fratello maggiore mi fece ascoltare per la prima volta la canzone Toxicity.. Da all'ora ne fui rapito e questo gruppo (insieme a pochissimi altri) hanno fatto parte della mia adolescenza e crescita. È un peccato che per problemi tra loro non riescano più a mettere del materiale insieme e far uscire nuove canzoni 😔 Con tutto quello che succede al giorno d'oggi nel mondo la loro musica di protesta servirebbe a molti di noi.  Magari un giorno torneranno!!
When I turn 15 Serj will be 60😔
Don't forget why they do this comeback song
This band needs to come back
this goes hard, but we need more to beat the devil
Acho que o SOAD não consegue fazer musica ruim kkkkkkkk
This is my favorite System Of A Down song
Love this song. I wish there were more new stuff from them
Fantastic lullaby. SOAD rules.
I AGREE WITH peepwebdev575 because this is yet another bad ass SOAD track.  Dat shiiiaat is tight like Cordae "Have Mercy" track tight. Message delivered, both good points taken. Niiiiiice!

I love how imaginitive everything they do is.
Serj's voice sounds very different from what I used to
Almost as if the hit pause on the guitar hero track

They don't age in terms of musical style. They are dn the present but still throw us back in the early days.
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 save palestine

1:11 I like this sounds
This is the last soad song. I wish i would be wrong. Never has one country depended on the help of one band
I love how this song just switches to fucking black metal for a bit
What's your stance on the genocide done by Israel, US, UK etc to Gaza?
Bob rose favorite song He liked to beat the devil out of things
SOAD LOVE YOU FOREVER
1:19 Casually becomes a black metal band
Будет видео как Пашинян продал Карабах?
Hate how they casually tell us the horror of our world and Americans just see this as a banger
Free Armenia 🇦🇲⚡️
This might be the best Christian rock song that’s ever been made and it’s not supposed to be 😂
I miss System Of A Down.
I don't see those dudes talking about Palestine
i remember in 2006 i was a little kid (elementary school) with my walkman and SOAD Mezmerise album. And i love them until now. Thanks for their spirit, stand-up for, and harmony. Big love from Java
1:20 Blast beats 🤘🏻
I dunno about you guys, but I've been thinking....what do you guys think of SOAD covering Scorpions "humanity"?
Dw
System of a down, thankyou again for transforming my simple writings into artistic music ❤. One of these days I'll simply have to write you a full 20 piece copyrighted work. Not today. This week I'm resting and recovering from moderate depression again.
Daron has the same pure soul as this boy with the flower. You can see it in his eyes.
for me..zio nis : the devil
داوشمی بموالا ❤️
Imagine hearing a full length album just like this! 🔥🤘❤️
I understand this is what we all want but, Serj has a sad look in his eye. I havent seen the smile since Harakiri. I hope he can find happiness in SOAD, i remember being a kid and hearing Empty Walls and Sky Is Over very often.
Love the heaviness of this track! We need more boys!
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏😊 please read  Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better. And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea. Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself. I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏  Amen.  I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊  ''   CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, Please forgive me and my friends and my family for our immoral acts, please help guide us in a positive direction and please help us against evil. Please save us from Hell and have mercy on our souls. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen.  ''  Please say this at least once a day for at least a month, do it longer if you want to and can 🙏  You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏😊 Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol.   Please put your hands together 🙏 bow your head and say this prayer: "CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, please know that I worship you and not any idols. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen"  Say '  Om Namah Shivaya  ' or '  Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya  ' out loud or in your head 108 times, or try to do it 1008 times 😊 try to do it everyday if you want  repeat this aloud for as long as you want to, try to do it for like an hour a day or say it in a prayer  "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner" 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 You can also say this prayer once a day or repeat it aloud as many times as you would like to: "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen."  Galatians 6:7-8 "Do not be deceived, GOD is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.“   Thessalonians 5:16-18 "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."  Philippians 4:6-7 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."  "O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!"   Repeat this aloud at least 3 times or as many as you want, do it everyday if you can   I apologize for all the words 😊 I know how it may look  If you can't remember the words to any prayer, pray them as you read them if you cannot look and remember them 🙏 please consider beginnning daily prayer, it is a good habit that will help you if you do it and continue to do it. Don't just read from the Book! Actually practice daily prayer, the most fundamental part of religion (or one of the most fundamental parts). What would any Holy Book be without regular prayer? It will actually help you!
Sonzeira demais ,preciso de mais músicas deles 😢
Dang. This is more relevant than ever now. 🇵🇸
Totalmente aplicable ahora VIVA PALESTINA LIBRE!!

Dear Serj Tankian,   DAD!!!!       I have been having a hell of a time evading people who are at war with your (our) Country. I have been kidnapped, stalked, trafficked, and then some by some of these people. I am in Fremont at the library. I have your Christmas present from 1996 from myself and from Maynard James Kenaan. If you can send someone to me to give them to, I'd be so happy to hand them over to them, I just want to make sure that they aren't going to destroy or steal it. Its hard to miss me. I look just like you, sound just like you and make a lot of the same facial expressions as you. The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, I guess. I am at a halt and a standstill in my life. I bought a harmonica and I will be playing it tonight for fun at the stage of the park by the lake and waterslides. Can you send anyone? I love you Father. I would give anything to meet you in person, but if it's not in the cards, I understand. I love you. I love making music.   Sincerely,  Michelle Dawn Fahmie

Is this a song about gaza? Seems like one
1:20 and 1:39 the drumming......
This song is so amazing because people need to realize we're all human. We live, die and bleed the same. We got the one life and we need to use that and shape the world into something better. I know you guys can do it

Life: there's no such thing as a male version of your mom- Daron: hello! 😁😈
O Serj ta a cara do Marcos Mion
2023 and this song is so f ing relatable.... SOAD always raw real and I love it!
simplesmente amo...
I'm gonna be honest with the Ukraine war going on I expected to see SOAD do something.  War is like what half their music is about.
I love the animation in this video, but the constant camera shaking makes this hard to watch.
This definitely does sound like it came from a SOB album, and that's why I like the song.
crazy to just drop a song 14 yrs later like its nothing lolol
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
i have soad fever many times a year, today its been a week of non stop watching live videos and shit. i love you guys
FIGHT THE ORCS!
Isreal should use this as their new war theme anthem.
Thank goodness they stopped rapping!
🇵🇸
Let's together, Free Palestine
Listening to this song for no particular reason this week.
B U L L S H İ TTTT
Um admirador aqui.
Crossover thrash.
Моии
Bloody hell, what a sound! Really fat and full! Incredibly violent, just brutal!
Am I the only one who heard a bit of boom! In there?
Love this band! They are clearing their name! They're only from what I've heard from many years of listening to their music is trying to liberate their country. And viewing things from their perception is something that we as Americans may or will not come close to and have not yet  experienced! I commend these gentlemen and I Thank you for letting us for many years. See what you have gone through and speak for your people with such passion.
The gunload noise played at guitar is incredible
It hurts to listen to this song now in 2023. The Armenian Genocide never ended.
People who don’t like soad are L bro soad is literally the best😱

Bro ❤❤❤❤❤
Wow, SOOOOOOOOOO much better than Protect The Land.
Meh. Ever since darren decided he needed to sing more they continue to go downhill. Serj is the man, and their first albums really showcased his vocals. Then steal this album came out, and i realized it was over.
Can You See Us Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  You Me Us Them  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can You See Us Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil  Persecution ends now  Guess who's coming over to dinner The genocidal humanoidz Teaching warfare to their children The bastards that will be destroyed Guess who's coming over to dinner The genocidal humanoidz  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can You See Us Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil  Persecution ends Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil
So fucking sad that this is relevant again. Lots of love and solidarity to Artsakh from Berlin❤
🕊️
How can they still go this hard?? This is crazy, I love them
still no new album???
#khojali
"Praying i get mad pussy tonight"
Man. again Azerbaijan's government lost its mind yesterday. UGH
That Marduk bridge in the middle... Squisito.
So who else immediately thought of this song after the recent news
Save Artsakh!
Sadly, with Azerbaijan’s latest aggression, is it FINALLY time for SOAD to get back together and make more songs? 🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲💪
These lyrics!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭🔥
Really sad to heard this song again with a feeling of hate, Armenia is fighting against the devil one more time
"Prostitutes who prosecute" no better words fo Russia
Goosebumps
Вони бачили все завяасно, але "сумкам" це байдуже, всеж їх це дійде, в них не має безсмертя
This song hits hard.... F**k Erdoğan!
SOLTA O CD CARALHO, TA MALUCO ?
1:30 is really close to 2005 serj high voice which is insane because that was 18 years ago, and I understood they could take multiple shots. I think its so good😊
Time for a new album.
WE NEED MORE!
You lost hahahaha 😂
You are the BEST
Really good song! Hope new album incoming!
Idk why i always imagine daron as a mad beaver
The genocidal azerbaijani regime will pay for everything. They will wash in their blood.
At 5 years of age I AM ha-satan. Sorry but that purple flower was Florence NichtinGale vajay so gibs me a shrug or you can openly worship devil in me little FOV.
Что обозначает "Сбор средств"?
1:20 BLACK METAL LITERAL
ez win xd
i wouldn't be surprised if they spent all of these years to release an album as good as toxicity tbh
I didn't know that System of Down was involved in supporting terrorists.
I would love if SOAD made a song about the genocide in srebrenica ( BOSNIA ). My dad almost died cus of that😢
Lets all appreciate how they came back to put together these songs for a good cause despite being in their 50's and late 40's.   Stay strong Armenia and Artsakh 🇦🇲🇦🇲🙏
yeAh
So...turns out Orangeman is really concerned about nuclear weapons and was trying to arrange denuclearization discussions, Putin said if we would he would and a china was on board to talk. But instead. ..😒
I think Ukraine is a test war for our new ai warfare.
I know that devil in the clip symbolizes the Turks.
So good, no words enough.
左よりのアルメニア、反戦以外にその先は
Love soad,great band
they took a break for 14 years its been 2 years sense(?) these 2 song's came out (Protect The Land & Genocidal Humanoidz) then nothing was heard again i hope they will be back again soon with an album or EP
I love the fact that the animator though that an armenian child would have nike tennis
Imagine a full lenght album with this sound 🔥🔥🔥
System não tem comparação
imagine being the perfect band and never releasing anything :/

I love Daron ❤
theres a reason darian chose this to be soad rather than sob
I know their fear is tarnishing the good name of classic System of a Down with new music. But the band needs to grow a pair and release a new album and tour. They have the music already just wont release it.
Ouço SOAD desde muito pequena, aprendi a ouvir com a minha irmã que é apaixonada pela banda! Meu SOAD não morreu!
I was in jail 3 years ago watching a movie with Shia Labeuof in it called "Disturbed". And Lonely Day started playing. And it was also my birthday. That song got stuck in my head and i wrote the lyrics down. When I got released. The first thing i did was look up the song and I had it on repeat all night whilst i slept on the floor of some apartment that had nothing inside it.  I fucking love that song.
🐺🇹🇷🐺 The new System of a Down project disappointed me so now I'm tean Turk. Not a horrible track tho I kinda liked this one as a throwback to how good numetal was.
I can't wait for them to do a concert 🙏🏾 I missed them back in the days but never again. 🤞🏽 Please come to Boston
Siempre seran mi grupo favorito,aparte de tener excelente música y letra, nos hacen cuestinarnos muchas cosas que pocos quieren hablar o pensar... gracias SOAD por siempre pensar en su gente y apoyarlos ✨⭐❤️
Que trabalho fantástico!
Man these guys a scary good.
Honestly one of my all time favorite SOAD songs
I love how there isn't even one negative comment and we all collectively agree that soad never disappoint
1:20 John is f-ing 40, HOW IN THE WORLD IS HE BLASTIN' DESE DRUMS?!?!?!?!11
I come on behalf of all Brazilians who enjoy Elite Rock, to say that. 🇧🇷❤🤘🏻
Damn they couldn't give us 10 track album😢,I want more of system of a down
It all went downhill when that guitarist started having a major singing role. Shut him tfu. Go back so suite pea and keep bangin!
❤
Dolmayan sounds unreal just like the first album...absolutely mezmerizing
No Terrorist Hipocryt only the Fero  Aladdin deny if u like i play with your music in my way
As far as strictly the music is concerned, this sounds very flat and uninteresting compared to any other System song. Put me to sleep. Big Lonely Day vibes, just boring.
Nice Boyz! Glad to see you on the good side taking Satan's music from him/it/her whatever the ef it calls its self.....but it becomes more real and to see a true band recognize and take controll is enlightening
The drums! ✨💥🔥💥✨💥🔥💥✨
This is why Serj doesn't want to make a new SOAD album. Daron steers the reins and he's been stuck on the same Hypnotize/Mezmerize sound for almost 20 years now. Serj wants musical variety but Daron seems incapable of it.
wut... least second half get better but hot damn....
Didn't love protect the land but this track rules. Sounds like something of hypnotize/mezmerize. Hope they can do more of this in the future.
Come back guys.
Love this song
Heck yeah man! I've always loved them ever since I was a kid.
i just returned here to heal my ears after hearing uzi vert's cover of chop suey
they support Russian aggression, it's like supporting and justifying Hitler in 1941
Serj looks like my dad.
I need more SOAD for my soul 😢
OMG OMG OMG! I’m Dying with this Music. I didn't know they had posted this new song😱
Not about age its about legendary talents that transends!!! Nubbies learn... And bow
Excellent 👌💚❤
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
This song along with Protect the land makes me want fight along side of the Armenians
This isnt just metal. This is the rusts from the metal.😂
Enjoying your songs here in Puerto Rico. Liquid band at Limo Viejo Dorado playing your great song! Disorder!
Looks like they started to realize the true nature of humans finally.
Why are they glorifying the devil With repeating the name over and over again  When satan is a fallen cherub  That will burn in the lake of fire for all eternity along with all the wicked that deny Christ Jesus the son of God As their Lord and  Saviour
No entendí
Favorite band of all time
Korn, и систем  ужас
They're back!!
Ваша совесть. Ваша жизнь. Я из Украины
This goes extremely hard. The blastbeats and vocals at 1:30 are perfect - the production, execution, everything... If this ends up being the final song of their career then I can't imagine them going out on a higher note.
إنهم عرب
Heavy
Welcom FROM Sistem of the daum
Keep rocking with creativity!
1:11 is my favorite part
Sounds like something from FNM's King for a day album
Amazing how they can come back and sound as good as ever there have been so many other band reunited and been disappointing asf. They left when they were on top of the world this brought me back 20 years. GOAT'S!!!!!
Omg please come out with an album again!!😂😊😊  Miss you guys!
This song is so mid. Clearly just a Scars on Broadway song...
Such a shame he put the politic thoughts above music. He are vegan, disarmamentist, left politics and we respect him,but he don't respect who think different, unfortunelly.
SOAD: The Midas Touch
🧡🧡🧡
Shavo é incrível
sounded kinda bad until 1:11
Oh, came on, guys. If you could rec this song, you could release a new album. Im pretty sure. It would be awesome. Please, please, please.
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BAND!!!!THIS SONG.
پیر نشو لعنتی 😢
System of a Down War fighters. Not FREEDOM FIGHTERS. Freedom fighters is the US deep state government. They are fighting against the FREEDOMS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.
i dont care what people say serj is still a amazing vocalist
no kurwa borat xD
Melhor banda de rock
where have you been let me wait  long time.
SOAD never disappoint!I loved it!

Yo John absolutely KILLS thoe drums every single time.. Phenomenal

I miss SOAD
Terimakasih lanjut good mantap
May I suggest a yearly tour SOAD you as a band are just too good to let pity differences separate something great
Гугл не дает писать в поддержку моим армянским друзьям!

Everybody gangsta till the Armenians become metal

Brilliant,  fair play.  👏
From Armenia, with love, power, and hope

They went straight Bob Ross on the devil.
Just when you think they cant get any better. S.O.A.D🙏
а это точно армяне

People like you, feeding real messages to the masses... will Always be needed! Loved your music for as long as I can remember... and the latest tracks from a musical standpoint, blew me away... from a principled point and why you popped up again... I support and have donated... but please don't now vanish... make your voices heard! Scream as loud as can be and make the world aware!!!!!
Awesome clip! Tears on eyes. I hope your songs will reach stone hearts. God bless us all.

Nice to hear and watch together old and be loved System of a down.🤘👍

Ser es kes serum
This part slaps so fucking hard 🔥🔥🔥💯👍 1:10
that time we all thought we were getting a new SOAD album
I think I am going to cry now
Desde quando o Marcos Mion está na banda ?
They are the best. Welcome to the returning....
Y'all, plz stop. It's horrible
SOAD tries to take a political stand. Everyone in the comment: do an album!
Sometimes, anti-social. AWAYS Antifascist!
Best band I’ve ever seen live.   San Antonio 2005  I’ve seen everybody
This song, This Song, THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS I'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG WHILE!
Bad what happened and happened in Armenia. Thank you for being such a mega band and for enlightening.
Será que algum dia ainda vamos ter a oportunidade de ver um novo álbum?
Vi❤❤❤❤... Saludos from Sicily❤🐶🐶❤
Love to see you guys active still I can’t stress it enough
Промосковські сволоти, горіть в Пеклі
Sorry, can I pay with PayPal? I haven't credit cards
Serj a fukn legend ✌️
1:39 MAN SERJ VOICE IS SO BADASS IN THIS PART
Do more songs
What is that purple Flower suppose to symbolize?
You guys need to put your differences aside. Well overdue a new album is an understatement.
i dont care if serj voice has changed, soad can still be good
It's like you guys were frozen. Then defrosted and ready to raise hell when needed. Just continued on with exactly the same vibe, strength and meaning as what feels like so long ago. You guys are legends
The Armenian martyrs will live forever. Love from the Netherlands. 🟥⬜🟦 ❤ 🟥🟦🟧
EL TATA Y SUS AMIGOS
And they still dont look or sound any different! Yay lol

What a fucking song
they're incapable of making a bad song. #1 forever 🖤❤️
In order to volunteer for 10+ hours a week, you need to be able to afford it.  This is the Universal Basic Income. Let’s give volunteers a guaranteed minimum income of  $1,500ish USD/month.  So they can make our communities better.  Gun
that was so beautiful oh my god i’m fucking crying
Serj...... Where is that famous roar?? Maybe just once in a song?? For an old fans sake?? Of war... we don't speak anymore of war... we don't speak ANYMORE!!!
Hitler's perfect toy
Every single one of us, the devil inside
Proud to be Armenian.
Muito legal o system chamar o Marcos Mion pra cantar no lugar do Serj... Kkkkk
This is the first time listening to this song, and as a long-time SoAD fan, it feels like coming home \m/
Still the same SOAD I know and love with some new elements I like!
I saw SOAD in '97, opened up for Incubus (when they were good, SCIENCE) in this small bar/venue, maybe 200 people tops. No one knew who they were yet, at least I didn't.  '98 was their first album so I guess they were touring to promote it?  They finished their set, ending with WAR.  Thus began the first day of the rest of my life.  I didn't even wana see Incubus anymore
Awesome, awesome. awesome, hope they figure out their  shit and put their differences aside and make new album. Long over due - Anyway mad respect!
uff terrible tema loco me encanto ojala saquen mas temas!

Fantastic
Stop singing Daron! Haha
Amazing! Better with age, no doubt! Love the messages, as always.
At the end... Armenia
Estou todo gozado família
Serj move on.. Prick..
The very first CD I owned in my life was Toxicity , I got it when I was 12. I’m 29 now. Almost 30. In my opinion, you’re in the top 5 bands of all time. Right up there with Pink Floyd and the rest of them. Thank you for the great music. I’ll be looking forward to any more music you guys release as a band, and Serj’s and Daron’s solo work are epic too! Much love .
The most sad part of this song (and basically all of the war-themed songs of SOAD) is that I recognize Russia in this, my motherland. For me, unpredictably, SOAD became a band singing not only about Armenian genocide, but invasion in Ukraine as well.
All i can say is WOOW🤘
Fucking kicks ass....
This video is dope asf and the song is brutal asf I'm so blessed I've seen them 4 times but it's sad on the other hand that their might be no new more material from them again this band is one of a kind and there won't ever be another band like them who's influ my playing on drums and musically long live SOAD
My cokc is getting bigger. SOAD for life 🤟
They never lost it 🤘❤️‍🔥
I hate that 90% of fans listening to this masterpiece don't want to listen to lyrics😑
SOAD will always remain 1 of my favorite music artists.  This song is alright, but I just can't get myself to remember this song. It feels like SOADs attempt to pick up where they left off (hypnotize/hypnotize).  I kinda hope they try to make some music that evolves out of their previous song.  I'm sure that if SOAD makes new music, this song (and that other one in solidarity with Armenia) will be seen as intermediary.
India 🇮🇳 Armenia 🇦🇲 😊
Why can’t SOAD just come together and have fun like when they were young and make an album, no stress or ego. Have fun and I know it will come out like something we’ve all been waiting for!
How did I not know they had released new music?!?😮
Heavier than ever
The whole world will khow that we've had Armenian Genocide
The Rest of the band: Just jamming, having fun being together again meanwhile John: 😐 (this is obviously just a joke, don't take it seriously)
I wish Daron would stop using the Gibson SG and use his Ibanez Iceman again, that guitar sounded leagues better in my opinion than the SG for SOAD’s sound.

Petition For New Album Called Hiatus
Straight up fuckin banger. Like, my whole life this band has just been so great. This Das a welcomed surprise.
I love this song and I just listen to it ❤
Oigan me gusta mas slipknot

God I love them metal banging noises when you hear that guitar chug
Геноцид
Foda que banda essa .
separately you guys are good. together you are fantastic. please get back together for more albums.  please keep this at 108 likes.
it feels like Scars on Broadway ft Serj Tankian
finally the voice of Serj Tankian from 2005 has returned
They shoulda a screamer feature on this
Ну и всë хорошо, ну и слава тебе Господи
My goodness 😢I’m so sad and happy  The entire world needs your sound your amazing music 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Please do it for US !!!!!
Shalom
🇦🇲👍👍👍👍👍
Сука почему так сложно забыть про все разногласия на месяцев 7-8 и выпустить 1 альбом и разойтись
Ide love for these to do a new album already
A testament how great they are
I remember vividly when this song and “Protect The Land” first dropped, and i lost my shit. “REAL NEW SYSTEM?!?!” I cried. Yet it is a harsh reality to accept that we will most likely never get another “System Of A Down” album. It just makes it harder knowing that they still got it, and never lost it. Im beyond appreciative that they gave us two killer tracks. But just knowing an album will probably never happen just sucks, all of us, and themselves knowing full well they’re fully capable. And you have to ask yourself, was the band really that toxic? They came out of hiatus to at least perform together, which at least we have that. But its like, was the creative process that toxic that its like fuck that, we’re never creating together again? I just dont understand it.
SOAD are unique. I can only compare them to Rammstein.
Maravilloso ❤️
Please system of a down make a new album I want to see you guys live please
#russiaisaterroriststate
Oh they're still alive
I'M IN LOVE W THIS SONG
I think Serj’s new voice is very fitting for this song 😊
I love SOAD so god damn much.
Бедные армяне..бедные все мы.(
Pray for Armenia! Why it's a never ending War? Why? We need to open our eyes. Everyone needs to. Please stop the Geoncide in Armenia. It hurts for so long now. Stop this Endless killing.

My God, please guys, please, put out a new album. These current new 'rock/metal' groups are awful. This is how it's done. This is a protest song and it's 99% better than anything new out here. Not to diminish the merit of the music by any means because of it's content. Just saying that there are other protest type songs out there that are just shit. And the guys show they can do it, and do it a thousand times better.
Epic epic...the immortal gods of metal..hail SOAD.
Армяня я за вас!!!
Just realizing now this is basically, "Attack" part 2, but it's still an amazing song.
That was fucking sick.
I hate how this song fits into yet another context now. It's like the Dead Kennedys' "Police Truck" in that we keep doing the awful things the song describes.
!! PHOTOSENSITIVE / FLASH WARNING FOR THIS VIDEO !! (also i dont get motion sick so im not sure, but this video is very shaky. it does not stop besides for a few seconds of animation, generally only around 5-10 seconds)  putting this here bc im epileptic and get really bad migraines.. i dont ever ask for likes and i dont see a use for 'em really but im only asking so it can get to the top and be viewed more, so.. please like this so it can get to the top and can be easily accessible!! (or atleast until soad adds this to the desc or somewhere in the video) please be careful! i highly avoid just skipping out on this video because 99% of it is JUST flash.  timestamps (warning: please DO NOT CLICK if you are sensitive to these things!! these are timestamps to AVOID.)  really fast strobe lights, flashes black and white really fast and intensely for an extended period of time.  starts at 0:29, ends at 0:37. starts again at 0:47, ends at 0:57. starts again at 1:00, ends at 1:06. very mild flash at 1:11, ends at 1:16. blinks black and white for a few seconds very slowly.  fast strobe lights begin again at 1:20, ends at 1:30 for a brief second, then starts again at 1:34. ends at 1:38.  starts again at 1:53, pauses immediately at 1:55, but then starts right after at 1:58. pauses again at 2:01, starts up again at 2:08. ends at 2:17.  last flash starts at 2:20, ends at 2:41.
Let us die happy and make a new album!!
they still got it
I want a new album so bad 😭💕🙏
Sposibo vam 🌹🌹🌹
If they ever make a new album, it's going to rock the face of the planet!
The symbolism of the very demographic they appeal to being their demise is fantastic.
Amazinggggggggg
FUCK YES!!!
This is literally the only band for which I can hear every random song I find over and over and never get bored, and this is no exception. I'm overjoyed to see they still got it. <3
I'm glad they released some music but it would be dope as hell if they would finally just f****** release at least one more album, need to put their egos aside and make one for their loyal fans!
Daron malakian sings more but their merging of voices is something with something
vicinity of obscenity vibes at the end
Come on the glue this band has might stretch but never break and all being Armenian helps that bond I'm pretty sure.
❤️

it's pretty cool to see an brazillian animator animating to you guys!
Keep fighting for your people! Never stop!
Imagine if serj where The pastor of a church, it would be the most amazing church chorus ever

I wish these guys would make a new album. We could REALLY use them now in our current screwed up world. But even if they never do, I'm eternally grateful for all the great music they gave us.
Man when @0:30 hits is just pure magic

💜💜💜
this was a great surprise in 2020. it's said there's a few other songs done, but, they were deleted/to be used by Serj for a one off release and, so much more, we wouldn't know what the truth is. The band was going to release a new album, but, so far, this and their other song is the only new material, and that's GREAT
❤❤❤🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🎵🎵🎵🎵🕺🕺🕺🕺
Wow my favorite
Saw them twice with my son. One of the greatest concerts I have ever seen and I have seen them all.
We need new system of a down album, we need it

И снова все это актуально..
Again and again...Armenia is under attack !!!  Azerbaijani terrorists are initiating a new war!   On September 13, from 00:05, the units of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces started firing intensively from artillery and large-caliber rifles in the direction of Goris, Sotk, and Jermuk towards the Armenian positions. The Azerbaijani side is also using UAVs. [Ministry of Defense]
Ottomans massacred not only one side of my family but the Assyrians as well and now the remnants think they’re gonna succeed they don’t know gods watching over us
Now the world has become so crazy that WE. REALLY. NEED. A NEW. ALBUM.

Bolsonaro Genocida!
На что сбор средств?
Fukin' awesome!
i Really want to listen the fuckin system of a down, kicking ass holes like it must to be since ever.... Serj please bring us your   RAGE against the system again just like did in back days... Love you all and LONG LIFE TO SOAD!!!
Wa
Just wanna let other SOAD fans know about the _wonderful_ vocal/musical analysis of System's songs being done on the channel "Charismatic Voice"... Elizabeth is amazing!
I know Serj has said he doesn’t want to do another album, but for the fans man, we’ve waited 16 years now for a new album.
purple is the best color
💋
This is what is it about  https://youtu.be/unBdquVfnug
We need these guys back. I mean, for real. This is sort of back, but come on. This is such a outstanding band.
.
I dont know why but I laugh my ass off 😂
starting and ending, are they the same or different?
This video was like hitting a 110 with 1hp in full dharoks.
QUÉ BELLEZA. Estoy desbordando felicidad 😍

Эпилепсия
SOAD Makes me so comfortable, first of all Serj looks like a mix of my granddad and dad, my dads a system of a down fan too and what is it about Serj's voice that just, it just Serj i guess, yeah but apparently shouting makes me comfortable i guess
As soon as they come up with a cure for epilepsy i’ll be able to watch the whole thing 😍 loving it so far tho! (glitch)
qué bueno que no soy el unico larga vida #SystemOfADown
Will you ever do another album?
Wow. Ty trick trubin.

Los extraño mucho!
Its nice to see musicians speaking truth to power again. Musicians and celebrities in America are government worshipping statists who treat their political masters like Gods.
Esses efeitos de luz deixaram Tudo melhor 🤌🏼🇧🇷❤️
brazil got no flowers
It's been a year daddy
No.1 Love
Dude why can’t we see more of System of a Down more fuck it drop a album 💿 please just like other artist that kept going y’all can too I would forever be a System of a Down listener
System of a down is just rage against the machine on crack
IT FUCKING NEЕDS TO BE IN THE NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND 3!!!
The old Soad is back
System Of A Down is still around, kicking ass.  I love how they still have their signature sound, no other band is even close to their style.
May satan burn in hell forever, hanged on a dead tree, burning on it, FOREVER!
Serj tá a cara do Mion
🤯 шляпа
Masterpiece 🤟🏾🎸
The creativity and lyrics are exceptional. Why don't you release a new album!
This is Nu Metal???????
2:08 2:17 best part
Glad they're back!!!
This freaking slams
This song better than K-pop and every gender of music thath 2000’ legend
This should be the theme song for 2022
Serj doesnt want to sing in this band anymore, he lost all his vibe and energy, Daron is also not the same, Shavo is the same as 21 years back, John is getting really good at drumming.
"The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start".
The World needs System of A Down, but it seems like Ego prohibits this gift to the World.
can u see us
Damn I love this
Brothers and sisters in hand!
Long live metal!
Fuck yes !
This song hits harder than my epileptic attack
Please 🙏🙏🙏 we need more System of a down.
I need another album with everything so crazy right now in the us and the world workers suffering from inflation and inequity. I miss you guys 🥺
No… I can’t… SoaD changed my life as teen. You can’t be back, you just can’t.
Satanic.
Америка 🇺🇸 в жопе давным-давно. А Байден маразматик.
LOVED this band when they came out. Love them still now. Don't stop creating music, ever.
Братцы, для туаеньких переведите. PLEASE
Shaky
I was listening it at 24 february 4:50 local time, when the rockets started fly above me
Gimme Fuel Gimme Fire gime gime a little charizard!
I haven't looked for new SoaD music in years.  I know Serj was doing his own stuff. I had assumed one of you had retired.   With how messed up our world has become; I'm glad your back making noise about it.   SoaD, among the few who never turned their back on their message; not for money, not for safety, not even for their fans. SoaD is GoaT
pelo amor de deus, lancem musicas..... por favor
The only thing changed is serjs vocals, i wished he still could perform those screams but i understand he wants to keep his vocal chords safer, fantastic music anyway
Serj is the shit. He can knock out those tunes.
only tfgheter ...
I think no matter when you listen to them, SOAD songs are always relevant
When you realise what the song is about.
Very TRUE Lyrics, in our Crazy days, there is a slaughter in Ukraine for the Elite's benefit  that has no country, nor soul, only money ,..." the Genocidal Humanoidz (of Anatolia) teaching warfare to their children"... are dreaming of OttoMania  and new Genocides, THANK YOU SoaD,  we need some political spark to wake us up, and THIS IS IT !
One of the most unknown but amazing songs from system of a down..
Holy Sh*t!! System!!
How the fuck did I just find this? I gotta be dreaming xD I never thought I'd see the day
I would be very happy if SOAD released a new album.
I just turned 50 have been realizing that the American government does not represent there constituents. They represent big pharma and the industrial military complex in which sickness and death is there number one priority. I can name nothing they have done that is good.
HOLY FUCK! What a good song!

Dedicated to Armenian People ❤️..SOAD🤘🏻

i work at a dispensary in AZ and Shavo just did an instore signing to promote his brand, got to meet him in an intimate setting, what a cool f*cking dude! Bucket List item achieved!
ARTSAKH WILL RISE AGAIN
Into record melter keep a candle
It's been too long. Thank you SOAD
I'm convinced these guys couldn't put out bad music if they tried. Wish they'd get it together and put out another album
system nao morreu.
Not too sure about the first song yet but this one is killer
Seeing and hearing Serj and Daron back together is a joy I haven’t felt in awhile. It feels like they never left.
Wonder what they'd have to say about me HoNeY
I love the frantic way this video is presented

Respect for the guy who had epilepsy...
Dudes are aging well.
Esta rolaza me despeina los pelos de los webos de lo epica que esta
The true vibes was the real shit we all learned along the journey
Viva System! lml nací en 1994! Y esta banda formó mi adolescencia.
someone should put an epilepsy warning on this video
Still great. Amazing Band!
classic soad.. love it.
Listen to the lyrics. "Guess who's coming over for dinner?" These monsters pose as regular smiles and handshaking humans and attend dinners acting all cordial with the utmost politeness but you'd be quick to forget that them same people were either directly or indirectly to blame for actual genocides. I'm always suspicious of overly cheerful and polite people who get offended at the smallest things. Stinks like rot to me.
Espetacular👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
2 legendary minutes after almost two years of hope 😏🔥
this song is better than any type of therapy
This song might as well have came out in the toxicity album... Because its sounds just like classic SOAD
💛💛💛💛💛
Bro they took a break about 14 years ago and come back like this, literally without any drop in the quality of the music. I love them so much, that's why they are so memorable.
I don't know if I'm a metal fan or not but I like Rammstein and SOAD style of music; it's like a loud scream at you but also social commentary.
They would take the spot light of the rock genre for a hot minute if they dropped some albums. #changemymind lol
Nooohay, Your Tryin To Prevent Me From Eating You Sweet Heart.
I just watched the live stream ii know Jon and Serj have there disagreements but it's nice they can put that aside.
We need a new SOAD
It’s sou Good 😈😈😈
4/10 7/10 2/10
wtf Kane from Command and Conquer?
Hands out. Nothing comes close to them.
Song is cool its good metal but lyrics is funny phahahah
This song was about Armenia, now it fits to situation in Ukraine as well…
і от знову ...
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
New subscriber
SOAD with a blast beat... perfection...
https://youtu.be/XByo7N2-ILc
Happy Independence Day 🇦🇲
We're still here and Artsakh is still Armenia 🇦🇲
I like how they still call the leaders prostitutes in their old music and still now
This is never die
legends
Son los mejores
Is this a reference to the ScAmDemmick?
🤘🤘
Nice to see Serj Tankian still going strong man...
can't enough of this
🛐
fucking good
why did this song became black metal all of a sudden😩
I feel old
Trash .metal new version
The black metal chord progression over the blast beat is a jewel crowned by Serj vocals. Beautiful is a huge understatement.
Shannon Boston Guessghost  What's the 1 question with an infinite number of correct and incorrect answers
Guessghost
We desperately need you guys back more than ever, everything is literally going to shit
Hope SOAD releases a new album soon, we have been waiting for this too long
SOAD’s lyrics make more sense than anything Biden says.
How have I never heard this song yet????  LOVE IT 🤘
Сразу вспоминаю Ереван в 15 году. Это было нечто
This is my neighbors favorite song whether they like it or not.
I've loved this band for quite a long time. But I didn't realize until now exactly how old they were. Amazing 🤩 Keep On Rocking Hard! 😈🤘
1:11 love that industrial, power tool sounding bridge. Also, Dolyman is letting his rage of not making more SoaD albums flow through here, he's ripping!
Sergio Sergio Sergio 👍😉
15 years and still has a unique style, come on many sounds you guys are great.
They sing against the war, but cannot even agree among themselves. Goddamn! Pull yourself together! You are only four people and we are only talking about one album! How difficult can this be? Over the years, I've lost all respect for my once favorite band.
Idk why i ran away from this for so long. That was great
John Dolmayan’s energy on this track is fucking outstanding. One of the all time great drummers
Genocidal humanoids is an understatement. These elites are fkn psychopaths. Godspeed beloved fam Get ready for the reaping. Its almost time. Be strong in love and fearlessness for the ones who sipped the syrup given to us in 2020 and onward will start their fall.
as great as ever :)
looks like old ones, sound like... old ones)
Que chimba se escuchan estos manes a esta epoca
I loviu🥰
Great Singer in a Polit Punk Band.....
Still as good as ever , spitting truth .
Desde cuba 🇨🇺 ✊
SOAD PLS COMEBACK WITH NEW ALBUM 🙏🙏🙏🙏😭
This sounds straight out hypnotize. I'm loving the if it's not broken don't fix it approach they took with this song
Serj is a Pirat
1:58 the visuals and the music truly show the beauty that System of a Down creates. Love them
parecen animacion de chain saw man
Where is pashinyan lol he is lost or something 🤣
This music video takes place in iraq
Love this band
Epa
New SOAD album desperately needed NOW!
Brilliant, the world does need a SOAD album.
I wonder if it would be possible for them to do a song for Palestine like they did for Armenia
It's so odd to think that John is a pro Trump, anyways they still on fire holyshit this song sounds like the best era of SOAD
Kinda disappointed yeah they are basically the same like 12 years ago but this song was just disappointing made no sense
Ukraine forever 🇺🇦

Lyrics/letra  Can you see us?  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Persecution ends now Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids  Teaching warfare to their children The bastards that will be destroyed  Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can you see us?

Damn
Как же похоже на Украину сейчас
👍👍👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Putin is a devil
SOAD in its true greatness! Thank you guys for this masterpiece!
Мы все братья, нерушимый союз. Россия на вашей стороне всегда
SOAD sold out
システムの世界観は揺るがない  新しいアルバム、そろそろかな
I LOST!
🇦🇿
fuck yes SOAD IS BACK!!!
Devil=Putin
This is so good I'm going to rip out one of my testicles and throw it at government buildings for a new SOAD album!
Damn to think that they can write masterpieces like this at their age is just mind blowing. I hope they continue to make songs that will stay in history.
I 🖤 it
Still my fav new but weird but (can B)ez tongue twister from SOAD. LOVE IT! Loving trying my best to sing to it!
Muito bom vsf
🤘🤘🤘🤘
It’s been one year since the new album let’s come back to this in a decade 😎
Bro i love these artists i have been listening them since 12. I'm 23 now and they still amaze me
BRO IS THIS SONG NEW WHAT
If a new soad album means having only Daron write everything, then fuck no. Give Serj the creative control he deserves first, cause Serj is a fucking genius.
как я хочу , чтобы эти ребята вернулись)))
SYSYEM SERJ DARON SCARS!! ALL OF THE ABOVE!!
Amo a banda, sera que os dois otarios, não se toca, que juntos são únicos,. porra a galera quer ver isso o system of a down , juntos porra, acordem e parem de putisse, vcs, juntos ninguém segura. os dois otarios, separados são nada, mas a banda junto é o que a galera ama, voltem e parem de frescura, dinheiro não é tudo, e vcs tem muito; fazem as passes de dedinho e volta o SYSTEM OF A DOWN é o que o mundo quer.
Imagine an epileptic watching this music video
Ахуенная песня, спасибо за настроение
Хуясе  Лукинг the Мир И скажи быстро Еееееее Сай ееееее Ееееее take me
:O
My favorite band ever!! ❤️
Those were the days Mary Hopkins redo that song it's what you like and it will be a instant hit
I won’t lie I can’t stand protect the land. But this. This is classic SOAD. Love it.
Keren sampai merinding gua . Wkwkwkwkw hahahahaha
Ya pasó un año :(
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
No entiendo como pase de odiar el metal a amarlo.... amo las canciones actuales y la banda  y DJS y todo ese pedoooooo y de un tiempo para aca me empezó a llamar la atención las canciones METAL no se pprque pero me están gustando mucho me relajan full y me siento bien. Jajaja me da miedo porque dicen que son del diablo JAJAJA perdón no se que pedo conmigo pero bueno aquí andamos. Saludos desde Chiapas
Just leaving a comment here to be reminded of this masterpiece
Слава Арцахе viva la vida viva victoria ✌️
This song literally brings tears to my eyes cuz it hits u in the feels! Especially from the 1:20 to 1:58 mark...it's so beautifully heavy I can't even explain how much I love it ❣️❣️❣️🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Amazing. Masterpiece
⚡⚡⚡⚡
absolutely AMAZING as usual
We need a system of a down Ukraine song to boost soilders moral support
The band that can come back after 15+ years with absolute bangers… I hope for more songs and peace.
How the fuck they sing so goood
THIS is the SOAD I fell in love with
just like old soad
..amazing:P  still rock the SoaD:P  good for them:P
Georgia and Armenia is Brother's 🇬🇪❤️🇦🇲🙌💪
Holy shit this is awesome!  Why did I not know about this?
0:37 Daron is so good at guitar he can play it without actually touching it
marcos mion tá diferente
Ukraine 🧡🕊
System
1:10 is so damn bouncy
I have some intense vocal ideas fir the middle black metal style part if you will. I think i must upload it and send to them. Fuuuuuuck. Systaaaaaaaam
YEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!
Killing it , they should have done an entire  new album
#russianwarcrimes #bucha
yeah, so which side in karabakh is bad? soad knows it is not their people of course.
Authentic!
Seems like those genocidal humanoidz just can't stop 🇦🇲🇺🇦🇦🇲🇺🇦🇦🇲🇺🇦🇦🇲🇺🇦🇦🇲 ✊
Badazz!!! Good Job !!! Much Love!!!
I need a new album I beg I pray i need it
joyofthedizzy
I am in love with this song it's Everything 💕🤩
we will always win and you will lose
Finally! A metal song that's against Satanism! I mean, they probably don't mean it literally and it seems to be more of an example then a thesis, but still!
Elhamdülillah Karabag is Turks' again.
Love it love them love 💕
Bro. This actually is amazing. Listening to system of a down gets old after a while because they have less than 10 albums out so after a while you know all the songs by heart. But this, this is brilliant. Not only is it new, it still has that old SOAD feel to it. Those completely random, yet oddly melodic, riffs is just what I was missing. Love to Serj, John, Shavo, and Daron. 🥲
Wait this is a new song?
you guys need some history class about genocidal don't be ignorant in the 21st century 😃
1:10 this breakdown tho, reminds me of classic soad
I think this is the better new song yet it has less views, it sounds like System! But I guess "time" has moved on
ты  марми ты  не арменин так еле еле ЧЕР  раньше мт равилась
Their rhythms are always so extremely technical yet it just rolls out with the ease that some of us equate to putting on a shoe (just one tho!!!)
Only SOAD can throw in a Black Metal riff and make it work into their style.
I am BEGGING you to PLEASE make New Albums    Please Please Please Please Please
Yo this got me bricked up
Oh God all I want to see is a new system of a down album
Am I the only one who thinks that this is low quality? This isn't SOAD we know. What is this s**t?
Please make new albums! I love every song on every one of your records. I miss you so much
Every song of Serj and SOAD gives me chills. Y'ALL WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST BAND ❤️🖤 Your music radicalized me ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿❤️🖤
Like NATO... you know... Or Ukrain drop bombs on Donbass since 2014
damm SOAD u did it again.
TURKIYA#1
⚔️🛡💣🏹🎸💪🏻💪🏻🇦🇲💪🏻💪🏻🎸🏹💣🛡⚔️
Wow can't get much better for the nu metal generation right now. These guys are back Korn and Slipknot are making new albums this year awesome stuff!!
Спасибо Вам за песню!
brutal
Am i the only one who thinks that serj looks like will ferrell here
This song or songs they put out to help Aid For Artsakh Campaign is even more relevant than ever! There is to much crazy terrible things going on in the world over there that have no reason to be going on! Sad and ridiculous!!!!!!!
We met another genocidal humanoidz in Ukraine two weeks ago.
Wow, I'm recently getting into system of a down and have heard this song on playlist and never knew it was recent, they still have the same vibe as they did back in their early days
This seems oddly relevant again.
These guys dipped for 14 years and came back with literally no drop off in song quality. Could have come out in 2008 and sounded exactly like this. Incredible
Pretty revealent at this time of year! #justsayno #holdtheline
Rocker girl and ghost face loves this song.
excellent the world misses you
🤪😍✌
Raw song love it
"Prostitutes who persecute"...is he talking about Kamala Harris???
Говнина, разучились совсем.
Please write another album. The World needs SOAD clarity right now
Gg
#armenia #ukraine ....
PUCK FUTIN!!!
😍😍😍
I am from Ukraine, Kharkiv. I've supported you when you had a war in Armenia. Where is your support when the my whole country bombed!?
Make sum new videos diz year...Yr music makes me feel happy.....So plz  i request
With all the bullshit WW3 shit starting now.. wish people would open their eyes and stop fighting through warfare. What the fuck kind of human wants to harm innocent people just because they’re angry about some shit. They teach us when we’re young to learn to behave ourselves and talk through things or find ways to get over stuff or cut people out of our lives yet here still to this day we have people of higher power that don’t know how to get along with anyone. It’s fucking sad
I’m getting the filling of sugar right now
Is this song about Putin?
Sorry Sugar, This is my new favorite.
Suaranya masih seperti dulu. Semoga kluar lagu" baru lagi.
The cycle of war is neverending. God help Ukraine. God help us all.
I love how Daron and Serj are going insane, but John and Shavo are just vibing and chilling.
They should try to make the Chic N' Stu video
Jeff Bezos really rocking that guitar 🎸
Ukraine today... pray for it
I had no idea this song came out. God I want a new SOAD album.
O mundo precisa de vocês, obrigada.
I love it!! The lyrcs say the reality, messege delivered with intelligence, just SOAD! When iu come to Argentina? Cordoba location please!🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Man the video is really powerful. The boy finds his purple flower and the devil tries to take it away, them in zooms out of tbe world to show a purple heat map of the Armenian diaspora. That hit like a bag of bricks
My god these two need to stop every time this group gets together the world actually listens and stop for a second  it’s beyond a masterpiece
So wonderful
Is so amazing that they still playing and making new works
They are legends
Queee bueeeenooo! What a goodness
Keep going up Legends never give up
we not need War. We need Peace
SAOD in my life 🤘
I really need you to come to Dominican republic 💙👆🤘 pleaseeeee
Muito boa essa música
Система (орёть)
serj kinda looks like a grizzled war veteran here
Daron sounds like Rogu
It’s great to hear new stuff from them after all these years, I didn’t love it at first but it’s grown on me, and of course I support the cause
Damn no flowers grow in Africa lol
banda boa
They are very great but ❤️ still they are human and eat food and wanna live peacefully .
Min 1:20 Kvlt of a down xdddd
I recognize the genocide, and you?
Just hope these guys at least do one more album, the fans deserve it and music has been somewhat dull in rock over the years. Their music got me through a lot growing up in my teenage years plus just jamming out in the car with friends or walking the city with my headphones in helped me to direct my negativity to positive moments.
❤🇧🇷
Shit, this one was intense, even as for SOAD standards. I need more!
Geil Genau zu meinem Birthday so ein Geiler song 🥰
give me more power with your lyrics and rhythm, keep singing and help world peace through your songs

1:34 the notes on this bit it just superb!
I truly thought we were going to get a new album.
The song that inspired me to finally learn guitar. Thanks SOAD.
I have been waiting for a decade and a half for new System and what we got was Scars on Broadway featuring Serj. Serj's lyrics are too perfect and helped me become who I am as a person. Meanwhile I find Daron's lyrics are bland and uninspiring. Lame. I'd prefer to forgo a new album unless Serj writes it.
and put those songs on the new album
killer riffs and drums and bass and voices, incredible, amazing
please, keep this song forever in your set list
🇦🇲
👍
I feel like that SOAD is about to work on a new album against the war what will definitely erupt soon (around 17 days left guesstimattetly). If you don't know what I am taking about, it's about russian-ukrainian possible conflict.  If the US would join the war or either the Europe, we would be cut off from the gas and about the US. The Chinese could join the conflict, taking Taiwan and also by that thing knocking out navy of opposing forces.   Every single human being in Russian standing against the war should be called a hero by saving possibly millions of lives. (For at least trying)

Show!!!🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I love the purple flowers
I don't know...
System Of A Down es una banda musical legendaria
Serj's voice kinda sucked here
il y a pas à dire, ils n'ont rien perdu depuis toutes ces années !! ça claque toujours autant !
Muito loko
Jesus, this band makes the best songs ever, how could somebody be this talented?
деды хайпятся)
typical reggaeton with 19 seconds of blast beat
Отвратительно.Времена были когда вашими же руками было сделано этническая чистка Азербайджанского народа с тех земель Шуша всегда была населена азербайджанцами.И город этот был создан нашими провителями.Не обманывайте семя Хватит строить иллюзии.Как говорил Леопольд."Давайте жить дружно")) Придурки
I have always enjoyed the system of a down, which is phenomenal
So good
I guess clever metaphors and word play aren't a thing in SOADs music anymore. I'm incredibly disappointed
5.2 million views and only 307k likes? If only we could see all the dislikes, this was definitely a miss.
new album when???? c'mon bros. obviously you still got "it"
❣️🙏🏻💪💪💪
Que bien canta Rick Grimes
This song is an universal disstrack against any of the enemy countries
1:39 why is this line so good?
Always gives me chills no matter how many times I see it...
uma caneta!
Տղերք ջան խոնարհվում եմ ձեր կատարած աշխատանքի առաջ ու իրօք որ մենք պետք է #ProtectTheLand #SystemOfADown
Es triste de cierta manera que, a pesar de ser un tema aún nuevo, las voces de Daron y Serj se complementen tan jodidamente increible y sin forzar las cosas se sienta ese respirar del clásico SOAD, tengan diferencias y por ello tal cual, no haya album nuevo u.u
One awesome band
Bad ass band 2022
I wish you weren't racist and factious.
FUCK YES
more!!!!!!!
Woooooow!!!! What an amazing track, and the videos, geez..... made me cried a lil'bit. Message received.
Wow, great piece of art!
These types if songs is what makes me the family disapointment
Bradil- Bahia
O system voltou!
Jesus Christ
1:20 is my ringtone
Hey, this is heavy
Need more!
After long years of posting such AMAZING music, their voices have changed a lot, but they still sound SO good especially Serj’s & Daron’s voices together
At 1:11 i got chills 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
🤜🏼🤛🏼♥️💙🧡🤍
Yo como todos me siento contento y con nostalgia a causa del regreso de soad pero hay que aceptar que la cancion no fue lo que esperabamos, no obstante también el cambio en la banda es notorio. Espero saquen esas canciones tan grandiosas y protestantes como siempre, gracias por unirse de nuevo legendaria banda...
Самая прекрасная эпилепсия которую я слышал
Almost a year already? How?!!?!??!
Los amo hijos de la poronga ❤️😎
S O A D 🖤
We are together, we're stop's the wars!!!!
I love System of a down rock band boys band i love their music also they are my new favorite rock band that i like also i am huge fan of them.
I had an auditory orgasm!! Fuck yeah!!!
Класс
Still amazing, still honest! Still love it!
I really wish SOAD would put their squabbles aside and just get back together again.
This hits
dudes are old asf but they still got it
Hits me like a ton of bricks every time
THE ENERGY !  omfg.... 2002 lets go!
They’re back they’re finally back!!!!!! Yeeeeeeeeee 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Still going strong
Just amazing!!!
Biden is the devil!!!
splendid, as always
epic. thankyou.
you killed my family
Glad their back feels good too listen to them again immaculate
...wtf??!  this kicks ass!  WHY HAVE YOU BEEN HOLDING OUT ON US!!!
Excellent song to work out to!
past : *16yr old me knowing they aren't a group anymore but still rocking to them all throughout high school*    present : *28yr old me knowing they finally came back and still rocking to them*
SSICKKKK OMFG how am I so late???
Im happy to see serj and daron together again since the split in 2008
I loved soad since high school but when I got with my girl she had something to tell me when she heard me playing their music she told me she met serj when she was only 14 I thought it was Kool of her meeting him but then she told me she didn't like him I asked why and she said he had picked her up when she was walking by guitar center in ventura I guess he had just left from their seen her and asked her if she needed a ride she said OK so she got in and he was trying to take her home with him she was only 14 years old... that made me see him alot different my girl name is Vanessa he should remember that day cause she had to get off the car at a red light and run,,, u will be able to hear more of this soon in a special report coming to TV soon I will keep people updated on the date and channel it sucks to have to hear this from my girl now it effects her alot...
Unbelievable how much their finger is still on the pulse of modern sounding music, they are hitting harder and crisper than bands that era that never stopped, maybe its like a UFC fighter, you need a break or you burn out and lose your chin
Woiiihhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
que rico los viejos
Please make a new album you bums.
it's too good !!!!!
Thx
Years have gone by
I love you guys
Waiting for 20 years for this!!!!!!  YESSSSSSSSS!!!
💜
I'm impressed with the animation sequence even if it's just 2 minutes.
Очень рад воссоединению, но песня очень слабая.
The time now 🖖🏽👽
Yes 🙌🏽
Me encantan 😍😍😍😍
i really miss heavy metal among the stupid hip hops ......
OH F**k YES!!!!! New S.O.A.D!!!!!! Am I dreaming? This is  Sooooooo good!!!!
Beating the devil  We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil 😈
No no no no🤦‍♂️
Obviamente las voces van bajando agudo con el tiempo....  Pero la expresividad de sus letras e interpretaciones es sello de fabrica  Serj, Daron, Shavo y John: No importa que se junten poco, que ahora ya no se pongan de acuerdo tan seguido, en fin, NO IMPORTA...  Pero lo cierto es que simplemente GRACIAS por dar voz a tantos que son ignorados  Y no solo Armenia, que est nuestro mundo algun dia deje de ser un reguero de sangre, y menos aun por las torpes ambiciones del hombre sobre el hombre  Empece a oir sus canciones hace relativamente poco... y no podria estar mas orgulloso, identificado, en fin.  Una vez mas, gracias por tanto.

1:20 when soad goes black metal
the best of the best
i love the mesmerised/hypnotized vibe in the beginning and black influence in the middle breakdown
DAMN
Da paura 😱 😱 😱 👍
Best drumer EVER
This is the ultimate tease, we need another SOAD album...like yesterday
Awesome great music song rock 🤘🤘🤘
Maybe the black metal drums are a symbol of the devil they’re fighting.
ya pe Serj, no seas cagón que todos los System menos tú quieren sacar nuevo material:"v
hentikan semua pembantaian umat manusia di alam dunia
Anyone that had listened to all the classic soundtracks, demos even, this just sounds like it comes from the classic era. Truly amazing.
Good stuff rock on
🇦🇲
:D YEEEEEEEES
I'm way late to the party. Just discovered this band. AND I LOVE THEM!!!
I miss daron instense stare
what a great irony, those who commit the most murderous massacres call others "genocidal humanoids".
The fact that john can play his ass off and atill remain emotionless is astounding
MAD
Now fans are happy: a new album is here.
I 💘 you. ♈ 😈.
01:11 power
1:11 my favorite time...
My brother went to the concert
Im so glad theyre doing music again. AND this is so CRAZY!!! the double-kick around 1:20 is so awesome..I hope they keep doing stuff like this and their harmonic-based things like "question"... excellent work, guys!
:)
Que mierda a cabo de ver fue increible
Yahuuu
mad? :D

This sounds like the classic system of a down
Enserió esta banda es una de las mejores del mundo
😎🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤘🏾
Musically still great. Lyrically a little weaker than i expected. Still, better than most newer bands.
Great
Attack on titan vibes
Al fiiiiiiin, 15 años de larga espera para que nos regalaran algo de su excelente musica. Gracias SOAD.... Gracias!!!!!!!!!
Dis his provavli de vest sonj in de güorldd ameisin
I love their partiotism expressed in this song and "protect the land".
God how I love you, please never stop making art.
Hey! they're back,  They're the best band in the world together.
Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to Ottoman Empire... and Erdugan)
1:10 I love this part <3
Temazo
i love this band's music but i hate their political ideology
I just can't stop repeat the song.
💚
Ребята, такие красавцы, Серж, браво 🤗
Fuckin' bastards. Keep crying ;)
Travis Scott needs to listen to this song....
ESSA FOI PARA O BOLSONARO.
Loved you guys until you got political about it, if they had fought the war and sought it out in 90s then it’s not wrong and sought it out again aswell but you guys supporting a side has made you the  bad in the sight of the Azerbaijanis and other supporting them
Armenians1990’s: We killed an kicked them out of the region  Armenians2020: We are the victims (a little taste of your own medicine)
Still you lost the fuckin war, finally Nagarno is liberated
This is amazing! 👌 Just like the old soad! 👌
Good music but I don't like middle eastern accent.
OH MY GOD I DIDNT KNOW THEY HAD NEW STUFF FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKKKK
gracias chicos
👁️👄👁️ Omg this is what I need
https://youtu.be/xW1Dpsc8ZIw
Love it when it came out
Aw, so cute. Bunch of grannies rocks again.
love from Philippines🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
✊✊✊
There is one band in this world with albums i can play front to back all day and never get tired of i freaking love this band
SOAD rails against human arrogance but can't stand each other long enough to put out 12 songs ever 2 years. Hypocrites. Rockstar hypocrites.
1:21 ~ 1:40 They sounded like Slayers 😅😅😅
Genial!! anímense a hacer traducciones al español, su éxito sería mayor.
The drummer playing blast beats shows that they truly haven’t aged a bit
Братаны, я - за вас!
🖤🖤🖤
So classic!!
I'm really glad to see these guys again i really hope they're back together

well done
Hail to Armênia...
WHAT? A NEW SOAD SONG? I've been waiting for this forever now!  And damn, that's quite a great one.
They sound so good live. If you ever get the chance to see SOAD, do it. Saw them in Fresno a few weeks ago and they absolutely killed it. This song absolutely crushes live. Better than this version. The studio version is also amazing. The message of preserverence, and hope that this song talks about must give Armenians so much strength. It makes me angry & emotional when I hear it and I'm American. Same thing happens to me with "Lives" by Scars on Broadway.
SUPER!!!
They are intact
SOAD,we need a new album lmao
so happy i got to see them live there so good even now
You will consider this was a good fuckin song when you often visit it , trust me.
LETS GOOOOOO!!! LOVE IT🖤
THIS IS SOAD!
quien juega pou
THE WORLD NEEDS SOAD AND RAGE BACK!!!
Have seen them live a few times and they've always been excellent.  This song sucks though.
Why did I NOT hear this song till now!? I fucking love it
this is honestly the greatest music video ive ever seen
I guess gain on 5,master on 12 and delay on 9
Beautiful.
Another instant banger
This gives me goosebumps.
When's the new album, dammit!
caralho,não sabia que o marcos mion cantava tão bem assim,brabo demais hahhaah
This is fucking awesome.
LEGENDS 🖤🖤
Saudades SOAD
Armenians have always had it rough from what it seems. They're surrounded by countries who hate them. Gotta feel for Armenia.
ผมคงจะเป็นไทยคนเเลกมั้งที่ชอบเพลงนี้5555
SOAD like movies:  First album: good and successful B movie. Toxicity: perfect sequel with bigger budget. Steal this album: the typical third part forgotten by many. (the godfather 3) Mesmerize/hypnotize: the epic "finale" of the saga. Protect the land/genocidal humanoidz: THE REVENGE
Still rockin 🤘🤘🤘
Me: I never run from the devil  You: I @ u
all video and a story has a meaning and a message and world globe at the end of the video points out certain regions of the world hmmm interesting
wanted you guys back over 10 years ago and now you're 15 years too late.... and of course not nearly as good as before..
I was just guessing the name of this song...  Lol.  Also, I just finished listening to Savage Garden, so there's quite the difference in music!
please new album please please pleas eplsee
We need more music from S.O.A.D.
People have always criticized the drummer for looking so serious /never smiling. It's because dude's murdering those drums!
NEW ALBUM PLEASE <3 <3 <3 <3 <3     BRAZIL
Crlh, achei que era o marcos mion

Армяне молодцы 🤘
You know even tho this is a great track I really miss serj's toxicity-era voice
THE UNIVERSE NEEDS A NEW SOAD ALBUM....DAMN THIS IS GREAT...THEYVE ALWAYS KEPT THE FORMULA THAT WORKS FOR THEM AND MAKES THEM THEM....MY FAV BAND OF ALL TIME CAUSE NOONE SOUNDS LIKE THEM,TOTALLY UNIQUE...ITS OPERATIC METAL...AND THEY ALL ARE GREAT AT WHAT THEY DO...JOHN IS 1 OF MY FAV DRUMMERS CAUSE HE IS INSANE ON THE DRUMS...CAN SWITCH UP A TEMPO AND TIMING JUST LIKE THAT...DARON ,WHILE THE GUITAR ISNT LIKE CRAZY  SOLOING,THE SOLOS ARE STILL GREAT AND HIS OWN,NOONE CAN SAY THEY SOUND LIKE HIS GUITAR AND HIS VOCALS? F*CK!. SHAVO IS AN AMAZING BALL OF ENERGY ON STAGE AND THE BASS IS KICKING  AND THEN WE HAVE SERJ....THE SMILING CRAZY SINGER WHO YOUD WANT AS AN UNCLE OR COUSIN...HIS VOCALS ARE BEYOND REPROACH....WHEN MATCHED W DARONS ITS LIKE I SAIDI...OPERATIC....PERFECT FRONTMAN......THE SONGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AMAZING,ALSO TESTY ,LIKE EVEN IF IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ANYONE ELSE(pizza pizza pie,i.e.....us fans know what it's about....) IT MAKES SENSE TO US FANS SO F*CK ANYONE ELSE WHO DOESNT LIKE THEM...AND YES I HAD TO USE CAPITALS...MY POINT IS MADE...AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THEM IN INTERVIEWS ,THEY ARE AS INTELLIGENT AS THEIR SONGS..EVERY MEMEBER HAS A VOICE AND MAKES THEIR OWN POINTS AND OPINIONS AND THEY MAKE PERFECT SENSE.ESPECIALLY JOHN,THE DRUMMER...YOUD THINK HES A QUIET DUDE BUT GO WATCH SOME INTERVIEWS..THEY SHUT DOWN REPORTERS WITH DUMB QUESTIONS....AND IT ALL MAKES SENSE WHEN THEY EXPLAIN SH*T....THEY ALSO DONT LIKE TO SAY WHAT A SONG IS ABOUT BECAUSE THEY LIKE US,THE LISTENER,TO MAKE OUR OWN ASSESSMENT( as seen in this clip,a must watch https://youtu.be/h6DXigQ2nNg )  ....BEST BAND EVER.........PERIOD

1:41 Me when mom brings in the gucci belt
love  soad s2s2s2s2s2s
I was waiting for you guys to get back again!  Nothing like S.O.A.D! ✊🏻😎🤟🏻
Top
They never came back for the band ! They needed to send a message and whoever got it is great. You've got to see it as part of a complaint and listen to their previous song. Nonetheless, their music remains legendary even if they start to change it...
My 12 year old self hearing S.O.A.D for the first time: 🤩  My 25 year old self now: 🤩  Please my guys keep doing what your doing, your music isnt just a faze it's a way of life 🖤
We need a new song!!
Before SOAD (and so on...) every bands better album is the 1st. When will the SOAD best album appears ? (Can't wait ! Please before world's end!!!!!)
Great music
THIS. IS. SOAD.! Wow !!!!
Absolutely perfect !!!! They still have their own amazing sounds. Excellent
Hell yes! Still got it
Me encanta esta canción, se ve que nunca perderán ese poder y fuerza SOAD es una Locura!
Music is a peaceful protest
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alternative fuel  Guessghost
Hauntingghost
I never tire of listening from System of a Down. It's been so long.
Thanks so much, SOAD! Good to hear you again. Support from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Malvinas is Argentina. Arsatkh is Armenia.
Oh god, they're back! I can't believe! 🔥🔥🔥
Great!
WOW
This is Zionist Israel
WOW
I love the little details in this video, so many subtle (and not so subtle lol) references to Armenia and it's culture. my husband still has memories of using his first slingshot in Armenia, and the very end, seeing all the flowers around the globe...
thanks guys , my blood be stream again we need new albume
How sad that two communities that have lived with each other in joy and peace for centuries have been provoked by other countries and killed each other. And there's still this idiotic band that's dragging this out. Turks and Armenians, this problem must be solved.
DARON'S RIFF AS HEAVY AS SELF TITLED ERA!!!
Faz um dueto com a lady gaga
Spaccherete i culi anche nei prossimi 100 anni.
This is black metal
That was just brilliant
You are back? Whoaa.. milion thanks...
A great band.i love this song.i saw it on my music channel a cool video.thanks
This is for Jay and beyonce
I love ALL of you
Thanks you ALL again
This is easily top 10 songs ever created simply based off of what he’s saying.
Was waiting for this video since long. Looks great!!
System of the down, this song that just came out is awesome.
O mundo só não tem paz ainda pq algumas pessoas ainda não escutam System Of A Down
He bok he
At least something of soad..  we missed you
haceme tuya papu dolmayan
Please stop climaxing us! please masters release the new album!
Very much respect to the whole band of System of a Down, their creativity towards the art of talking about problems in society and rebellious against the prosecutors.
1:48 Самый лучший момент😢
This song needs one grammy award. Guitar riffs are almost simple but extraordinary powerful and unique.
Foda
It’s makes me feel old seeing them guys older
❤❤❤❤❤
This is absolutely insane!
0:40 Filthy Frank
Finally, another song with blast beats 👍👍👍
Such a good fucking song that sounds like classic soad.
Maybe are, 5081 dislikes vaccinated? xD
Man they never lost their essence, sounds great!
Kill radical religion and greed
This song maybe fit for Chainsaw Man Opening
Rolon como siempre 👌👌👌
yes this song is the same as the current state
thank you.. I need this..we need this..you need this..they need this.. mouth is silenced nowadays and just enjoying bullshit EDM, chill, and escape from the truth.. welcome back SOAD, inspire us more with your truth..shout louder and break the silence that is been looming nowadays..
Wait...am I hearing BLASTBEATS?  Like, black metal/death metal-type BLASTBEATS?  From System of a Down?  (mindblowing)  That was blistering.
Best pre-Work Out song💪
Gönöcödö.
Brutal brutal friends
По отдельности они конечно хрень выдают...а тут вот собрались и супер всё)
TREMENDO TEMON BROOOOOO
Never comment usually.  But im going through some shit and decided to turn on the SOAD after few years of no listen BOY its so GOOD!.  All of it! So glad i saw them live back then too !  (So yesturday I put on The older stuff...then i needed more !. So today  i put on mezmerized and hypnotized. And still needed more lol so i found these tracks and donated. I'm a singer and used to love harmonizing with them . Im a lil  rusty now , my voice is untrained and i smoke too much lol  BUT ill never stop loving it.  Singing Their music is CHEERing me up better than anything !   Making me want to quit smoking too !. (Switch to edibles maby ;-) lol. He he he.
Вы живы! Боже мой. Я не ожыдал вас увидеть! Аш душа радуется!
System siempre proponiendo. Excelente. The best band
As a Turkish, i must say that u killed it bro! Everytime i listen to that song,  i had teardrops! Tears of success hahahaha. And i am really sorry for the ones who donated, probably ur money was spent on one of the band member's nose, u know :)
Ta velhasso
I LOVIT . I LOVE SOAD
Uhhh pecah 🤤
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🤟🤟🤟
SOAD MUITO FODAAA 🖤🖤🖤🤟🏽
I need another soad album in my Life! I know all of the words to all of them
A great band will always be a great band
Blast beats?

Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

👌😭😭😭😭
Been listening to SOAD for years. But their the people who showed me the truth of the world. This song just adds to this horrific world. Loved this<3
This song sounds like it could've easily been lifted from Hypnotize. It's crazy to see that they can still capture that old magic and to hear Serj's aggressive vocals again is so amazing. Serj's vocals, Daron's writing, and their harmonies are what make System Of A Down such a great band.
Stop being little drama bitches and make an album.
Welll
Качественно, но не дотягивают
And now I can prove that I was right they are together
Serj tankian, o Mion do metal.
YO THIS IS SICK
🔥🔥🔥
🔥❤️💃🏽🧡💃🏽❤️🔥
Wait whatttttt
Love you all!
Marcos Mion nas horas vagas canta no Soad
WOW😱😱😱 what a powerful music👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌
EPIC 🔥
some of SOAD fans are weird, they want some new music but they don't even listen to this one.
When System releases a new recording, you know mankind is doomed and there is no turning back
I almost feel like there should be a scream right at the end when they say "We never." It just would have been nostalgic, but glad to hear new material finally!
How the hell Im not aware of this... Heck Im bursting into tears...😭😭.... It's so good like the first time I heard them in 2007🖤... A lots of motion coming altogether💕💥..  They're still the same

1:20 this is giving me Black Metal vibes and I absolutely love that!
Parabens Serj, por assumir o caldeirão do Hulk
Why does everyone write about how happy they are for the new song, and did not say a word in support of Armenia?
Queremos a System de vuelta Puñeta
Armenia forever...my blood is Armenian and im so proud
Una obra maestra 👌👽💣
I smiled with delight the whole time. I've missed system so much. And of course they didn't disappoint.

Honsetly. I CAN'T STOP REPLAYING THIS SONG. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SOAD, I've been listening My Whole Life. -You Should NOT have SENT PAPERS TO JARREN BENTON. -That was Disappointing!  Way to fail us. Now you wont even share the love with Jarren Benton, the best rapper to ever sing out. -Thanks.
nice rap song
can you have a concert in austria or croatia? PLZ
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÁAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT IS THAT?
game over liars
Que bueno volver a escucharlos! y mas por esta causa..
Xxam shop with me. ,,,,,,,

FUCK YES
I just found this song last night, and I've already played it at least a dozen times, So Awesome, and So happy to see you all again. Ya'll JAM intelligently. WOOOO!
Wew
I feel like I'm young again
Absolutely OUTSTANDING!!
Daron Malakian looks exactly the same as he did in 2001.
I love how SOAD has that middle east spirit, a very unique melodic sound
I may be living under a rock but i never thought i would hear another system of a down song after they split to serj's solo project and Scars on Broadway; both i loved
👍👌✌️
Rock on bitches🤘
Ебейше!
We need more System of a down  these days. Love hearing yall again.
N O LIGHTS N O O MUUS IK
A bunch o morons Pro Trump (except Serj) singing and playing a dead style of music that nobody cares anymore. What a waste of time.
Escucho casi siempre Soad y como puede ser que no me haya enterado de ésto. :'c Sé que siempre salían noticias de ellos que hacía más de 15 años que no tenían album nuevo porque no se ponían de acuerdo en muchas cosas... por eso no me fijé más si tenían algo nuevo o no, escuchaba lo viejo de Soad que es la ostia, pero escucho esto y es increíble <3 <3
To this day I don't know if I'm happy for their comeback or worried of the need of a comeback...it's hard to like a political group!
Goddamn, it's like the band never ended. Really missed you all.

"We Never Run From The Devil" from Indonesia 🔥🔥🔥
When all the world and its glory fell crashed and burned system of a down came from the heavens and saved us
Opera d'arte
начало вещи просто скопировано у Sweet  «burn on the flam” от 74 года))
“Back together” - you don’t see them together even once in the video. Only solo shots.....
Fuck yeah. The world needs System more than ever.
LA MEJOR BANDA DEL MUNNDO SALUDOS DESDE CHILE
"Teaching warfare to their children".... Call of Duty... Overwatch...  Fortnite... Need I say more? Every culture indoctrinates children into growing up to wage war, god wants you to go to war. Praise the lord, pass the ammunition!
Damn. This is one band that just never gets stale.
Mmmmaaaaahhhh siempre lo mismo...
i always felt like surge is what held this band back idkw
4.8k people can suck it
"Me, us, them" Pretty similar to "Us and them"
Great song.
Mi pr1mera Banda  de Nu Metal por fin estan de vuelta me hacían mucha falta
я щас вспомнил себя/, когда гонял первый альбом в плеере в 2003. это огонь
Ué eles voltaram???? AMO
WTFWHO? CDC WANTKILL YOU/ME. WORLD NEEDS S.O.A.D. THANK YOU BRAVE SOULS
Tan más viejos xd
Oh my i cant believe this after soooooooo long they are back with a huge bang and love it
fucking perfect man
Anca propaganda. İşe geldim mi en büyük katil sizsiniz, körsünüz ve görmek istemiyorsunuz. Sadece milliyetçilik yapıyosunuz.
The drummer playing blast beats at his age is incredible. These guys still got it. God dang I want a new album
Serj voice is eternal❤️
THE GENOCIDE
Does it sound weirdly dated at this point? Sure maybe. Is it joyous to finally see a metpahrocial father back as if no time went by amazing? Yes most truly.
Vocês nunca vão perder a alma da banda! E isso é lindo ❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
Love SOAD but this sounds like a spongebob and squidward duet lmao
Purest guys of them all. Artists. Godly artists. Sending love. Would love you meet you.
Pffft
Every follower from S.O.A.D. WE BEED A NEW ALBUM🥺❤ IS BEEN TOO LONF WITH OUT AN ALBUM
Cameraman: omg..my hands are shaking...  SOAD: That's even better...
Love you guys! Amo demais! 😍
This can relate to all of our corrupt ass countries today
17 years and they still sounding as good as before
My all time favorite band is back together again...feels like dream come true 😍😍
Serj is the Armenian RASPUTIN with a Mad monk voice👋😁 and the awesome rugs set it off lol
i love system of a down
Todo lo que hacen suena perfecto
Muito bom é difícil inovar hj em dia
Tem um genocida no Brasil...
What are you doing here Rick Grimes?
Genocida?!!! Tem um bem famoso aqui no Brasil.
Omg
Сегежа, сделайте армяне у нас в Тольятти. У нас были продажи, 20 секунд, мы Лето поржали над летом, он нас поддержал - это было 8 марта. Армяне, мы вас дико ждём.
Cool man
SOAD:Rage mood
Just noticed that little baby Serj even has all of the comments turned off for his new EP. And politics are why there hasn't been any new System albums in a long time. Dude should suck it up and stop being a 5 year old about it.
I love system of a down

GUESS WHOS COMING OVER TO DINNER
I can't wait any longer serj! Come on with it!!!
I wish Serj would use his deeper voice again.
They all know how to make music SOAD needs a full return
Great to see and hear their originality once again. Music to my ears. Love how Serj looks to Darron with the look of approval at the beginning. Awesome System of A Down once again, filled with strong and needed meaning. Thanks for many years of something different.
4.8k people are wrong

I’m new to SoaD and NEED more sings like this. Funky power metal. Please give me more tunes to listen to other than the radio hits
Sad how religion has infiltrated the minds of even the best.
This song is about Israel's subjugation of Palestinians!
Wish I could understand them so I could hear the message.
Now imagine this same song but with Serj's 2001 voice.

We need System back and need it now!! I think we’d all appreciate more music/albums/songs from these guys. The whole band sounds amazing together as one. True music for all who desire to listen to it. The true System of a Down.
Your move, Rage Against the Machine.

Who else kept up with Soad but never even had an idea this ever came out?! Am I trippin? Last I heard they weren't getting back together and a bunch of stuff was happening to prevent it from happening. Only to find out they put out new music last year and early this year?! What kind of Mandela effect is this?!
Band from my childhood comes out with new content and mixes a spoon of black metal into their music....LOVE IT!
The real SYSTEM OF A Down!! Ça c'est du bon system !!! Yeahhh dude!!
Each time System of a Down releasing new singles, the world becomes a better place.. 🍺🤘🔥
for me there is no better group of musicians and vocals in existence now or ever than system of a down. every single song is perfect from start to finish. please make more music.
Furia

Good lyrics. Bad aransemen music
When I was a kid in Chile, I never missed Titanes del Ring, a wrestling show where my favourite wrestler was Martin Karadagian (1922-1991). In fact, he created the show. He was born in Buenos Aires, to Argentinean mother and Armenian father. He was introduced as "the Armenian Martin Karadagian, the one who drives widows crazy". By this they meant the women who were widowed when he defeated their husbands ("the Mummy", "Pepino the Clown", etc.) in the ring. Sure, it was wrestling, nobody died, but what a show, folks, to see him advance to the ring followed by an entourage of "widows", still weeping.   Therefore, as a child, in Chile, thousands of kilometres from Armenia, I had a pleasant impression of Armenians. So when as an adult I started listening to SOAD, and learned of their Armenian background, in addition to their fantastic music, I viewed them with the same affection as I did with the Martin Karadagian of my childhood. Later on, I went to their Reunion Tour concert in Santiago, Chile, on 7 October 2011. After they opened  with "Prison Song", Serj condemned the atrocities perpetrated back in 1973 by the government of Richard Nixon and his lieutenant Henry Kissinger, in connection with the coup d'état that sent Chile back to the middle ages with the murderous dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Wow, these men know about genocide and repression, I thought. And solidarity. Their people have felt it in the flesh. Respect and gratitude from Chile!
Killing innocent diplomats is beating the devil, I take it :)
Angry song!!! Cool.. 👍
Free palestine
After all these years, welcome back!

Jeasus! A new song from a classic band and it freaking ROCKS. Great tune very System of a Down sound!
Welcome back.,.
I dont know what it is about Daron but when I was a kid my brother would watch their videos all the time and he scared the hell out of me. I think its the intensity of his stares.
Desde México 🇲🇽 Se sigue escuchando lo mejor del rock 🏴‍☠️
Adore, adore, adore !!!!!!!!
"The Prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start." has become my new life motto. I hate humanoidz.
HEY !!! WE NEED THE WORLD TO KNOW THE TRUTH THAT THEY ARE KILLING US IN COLOMBIA !!! Soad and everyone, in my country, Colombia, we are on a national strike, we are protesting against our corrupt government, but the police are killing the young people who march and protest. this is genocide.
Essa música remete a TANTA raiva, e SOAD sempre fazendo músicas fodas. Nossa, amo essa banda.  Os armênios nunca serão esquecidos.
SOS Colombia
just explain to me why everyone this week came back to see chup suey and claims a comeback but only offers 3 poor million views to that.
So happy to hear new soad cinco de mayo 2021 we here and we never run from the devil 😤😤😤
Real video clips can be considered those that are made according to the lyrics of the song, preferably with scenes taken from films where the actors express emotions. When creating video clips, I took this into account, so I suggest you watch them, for the purpose of entertainment and to assess their quality. Best regards MVP channel. Thank you. .
This is beautiful
This hits so close to home right now. Here in Colombia we are currently going through protests due to a ridiculously corrupt tax reform that was the last straw after years of this kind of shit, and unfortunately they have turned violent and bloody, with corpses stacking up each day.  As you can imagine, most of the national news outlets have been noticeably biased in favor of the government while ignoring what is really happening in our streets, but thankfully the people have not stayed quiet and have cought the attention of international media who are on our side for the most part.  I don't usually write these kinds of comments, but your music has always struck a cord with me, and this one in particular feels like it perfectly describes our sentiment even if our situations are not exactly the same, we are angry and frustrated and disappointed, yet unwilling to take this blow without a fight.  If this has peaked your interest I invite you to look up what is happening in Colombia right now. I personally hope that your efforts have helped your cause, and I thank you for helping me put into words the feeling we have towards ours.  #SOSColombia

Sistem of down forever
We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  STRONG ARMENIA!!!!
Still putting out 🔥
My childhood and teenage years have come full circle into my adulthood. Decades later these guys are as great as ever. Love you SOAD, never forget the genocide of our Armenian brothers and sisters.
Yes so. Joined the devil.... good quote... such a shame . New song shame of following the devil !!@@
In Colombia, my home country, a large number of citizens have been protesting against the government and its project to make a tax reform (among other problems such as health reform, the socio-economic crisis that exists due to state corruption and a government that does not listen to the people). However, the government's response to this, to a massive movement of people who want a change that brings real opportunities and hope to have a decent quality of life, has been to send the armed forces such as the police and ESMAD to oppress and shoot against the protesters (no matter if they are in a peaceful concentration). There are people who have been killed by these forces, women sexually assaulted and people illegally detained by them as well. The way they are acting is against human rights and it has been recorded and streamed in live videos on apps like Facebook and Instagram, so you can go and see that it is true. Now, my intention with this text is that you know what is happening here and help us to share and saturate social networks with this reality, so that international agencies and media start to deal with it and take action on the matter. Thank you to everyone who reads this 💖. Colombia needs you, they are killing us! 🇨🇴
SOS Colombia!!!!!
I was listening because the music was universal, but I don't want to listen to this Armenian group that is one-sided against fascists and racists.
Please don't stop! please more!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG Alguien Mexicano oyendo esta canción sorprendente??
This song is so amazing. I love it so much! It is so motivational in these horrid times. SOAD IS THE BEST!!!
#FORABOLSONARO

No perdieron ese toque 😍

The fact that these guys are still producing the same quality of music throughout the years is what makes them truly remarkable and memorable in so many ways
Oi

Yes, its good 👍
So happy to see you guys back!! We need you during this tim3!!!!

Im not sure if Armenia is in my blood due to some confusion in my family ( Armenian or Romanian) but  after all the researching I've done i know one thing. Armenia is in my heart. Regardless of its in my genes or not. 4/24. Forget them not. Never again.
Still sounding fresh fellas! Thank you for my childhood!

My dream came true
Angry Serj is T A N K serj,
Built up anger from all the mistakes genocidal humans have been doing #forabolsonaro
Doesn't give me that good Mezmerize feel.
"Terrorists we're fighting and we're never going to stop, Prostates' who procedure have failed us from the start." The best line I've heard thus far in my musical life, so powerful and true, right up there with Disturbed's "No more"!
With all the flickering lights, Serj's look confused me with John Turturro. lol sorry. Still bring that goosebumps listening to you guys!
Feeling so happy for them because the United States and a few other nations finally acknowledged the Armenian genocide
Jesus fucking Christ. This is System 2020, no question. At least they came back when we needed them most, wtf Rage.
My god not even I have listened them for a year AND THEY GOT OLD But...THEY ARE STILL LEGENDS
This is also fucking terrible.
Shoutout to Shavo for co directing!
Black metal starts at 1:21
A dream came true when I saw that they were back, and I missed their first concert to corona :( <3 Im happy they are back finally..!
???
Could you please come to Florida on Panama city beach
Long live Armenia 🇦🇲 from El salvador 🇸🇻.

Alright System of a Down, a show of hands, who's been listening to black metal?
System Of A Down kick my ass with another powerful song ! SO GREAT !
It just brings tears to my eyes each time I watch it.  No wonder System got back together in 2020 because now more than ever we need people with something to say to speak their minds. Otherwise the conflicts get buried by the agendas our leaders and the media deam important.
THIS SONG HAS SO DEEP MORAL MESSAGE...
We need a new SOAD álbum.... 💔
Awwn , SOAD released this a day before deadly coup in Myanmar.   Yes , Kids are facing exactly this kind of situation.
Love you so much guys!
Can’t for them to start concerts
THE WORLD NEEDS A NEW SYSTEM OF A DOWN ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nossa que som incrivel, amo vocês  ouço desde de meus  14 anos e tenho 17 agora, vocês são incrivel, sou do brasil e ate aqui tem muitos fans de vocês
That was good So good
And now the President of the United States is formally recognizing the Armenian genocide from WW I.  I know this song refers to current conflict, but it still feels very related.
That was intense

Imo This is their best song. Fantastic!
As a follower of Jesus and a lover of truth. This song is the bees knees!

I have just discovered this song a few days ago and I have already listened to it 50 times. And I'll listen to it another 1000 times before I let this song die out.
Whos coming over to dinner?
Звучание как в "Steal This Album!". Такую Систему Подавления мы так давно ждали.

this is how armenian enter 🤘🇦🇲
Protect artsakh and armenia fight for what's right
The only problem with this song is It end too soon
Армения Добро пожаловать в европу))
Serj ta parecendo o marcos mion
Parabéns ao SOAD pelo seu posicionamento. Força Armênia e Artsahk! Hugs from Brazil.
Yg dislike ada masalah apa sama idup lu sih kawandd?
I knew you guys could do it,
I can't believe that SOAD released music, and almost no one has heard of it. It just goes to show how rock has disminuished its significance in pop or mainstream music lately. Which is a shame, given the fact that thanks to so many who have come before we have classics that would otherwise never had gotten to the light of day
This is so awesome!
Official Bolsonaro soundtrack
1:20 SoaD black Metal album when
Shout out to whoever mixed this, absolutely spot on
Eu sou muito muito fã da banda..desde criança Escuto quando acordo..quando quero relaxar..quando quero me agitar..quando estou em casa..no carro.em qualquer lugar eu escuto.. Pena que até hoje não tive o prazer de ver um show
I think they need Disturbed Vengeful One for real now .
2 new songs and its obvious they absolutely havent lost their touch. its like they picked up where they exactly where they left us hanging xD
My Uncle introduce me SOAD when i was gradeschool,. I'm in 30's now,. Still I'm a huge fan until now.
Please don't forget about what the armenian people are going through, they released music for a reason.
me alegra tenerlos de vuelta hermanos
Holy fucking shit! I just became 15 again. THIS IS THE SYSTEM I KNOW!
Luxury song 🤘
Yeaaaaaa🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
EPILEPSY WARNING
No autotune, no fake instruments just raw talent 👌🏽

Hey this sounds like Soad <3
Álbum por favor son la razón por la que escucho este género
Love the fact that this song just makes you feel like you can win over the corruption that is running thru this world when we are entering our dark time. SOAD is and have always been the inspiration the world needs

The songs of S.O.A.D. it's just a tongue twister at the adult level. Change my mind

Orang indo ngumpul dimari
Music of President Bolsonaro
Son lo mejor 🤘🏻
Love it. This will take your breath, especially if you are subject to epileptic seizures.
That was an orgasm I've been waiting 15 years for.
❤❤❤👌👌👌🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Boy am i glad I don't have epilepsy
If serj or daron release a song individually it wont sound like soad. And now they combine it sounds like real old soad.
THE GODS HAVE RETURNED!
I feel like Daron is a little bit saturated in the new new.
Clip is about Khojaly Genocide 1992, when armenian nationalists massacred 613 azerbaijani civilians, including 63 children and 106 women. Just google Khojaly Genocide and you will see
SIIIIII grande system of a Down Por fin los vuelvo a escuchar :')
Wish this wasn't just two songs written by Daron and recorded by SOAD.  I don't forsee any more coming tbh
And then there's that scumbag from the sickly named "The Young Turks" who still denies the Armenian Genocide
Awesome to see the gang back together, Seeing them together again really brings you back to them days. 😎💪
Wow wow wow 👍
this is what fascism looks like.. callling others as devil and pretending like you are the victim even when you are killing a child :)
Now this is proper system!
it's so crazy I love it 😍
This > Protect The Land   😳
1:20 System of A Behemoth
Marcos Mion virou cantor?
Sooooo thankful for SOAD
Never run from the devil
I LOVEEEEE SYSTEM OF A DOWN I LOVEEE
Yeah I’ve had epileptic seizures about 20 times already but it was worth it
Very good😍
Blastbeat 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yo the intensity of this song is unreal fucking love it!!!!!
Imagine once he learns that the devil is fake lol
I'm a new SOAD because of how every soad song I press I get hooked to it and this one is one of em
Wow, they suck just as much as they always have. Glad some things never change.
Genocidal? Seams like my president here in Brasil.... FUUUCK
1:20 Black Metal Vibes!
how long I waited for this :D
They turned black metal for a second.
*Заебись хуярят!👍🏻*
almost a new album. Sad, that Soad parted ways again.
*TAN TAAAAAN TAAAAAA TAAAA*
I don’t like the other one but this slaps
АЛЕ РУССКИЕ ВЫ ГДЕ???? не ужели соад я один сюда зашел почекать
Вернитесь к Нам
Lol
lyrics please
Listening to System of a Down while is system is going down is such a great feeling.
i trust daron to deliver another epic system of a down album masterpiece
So weird. Sounds exactly like the old songs. I swear ive heard it before when i listen to it. They never fail.
My heart just skipped 🥰
my epileptic brother loved this song so much he is doing a cool dance on the floor!!!
Can you believe some people either ignore/deny the armenian genocide or straight up say that they dont care about it? because i think if you recieve news about how the life of millions is at stake, sayingthat you dont care is pretty psicopathic
NGL This song was in my dreams whilst having a crazy dream and I woke up singing it in my head... Love your tunez!
🇲🇽 Hope 😎🤟
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Lucky meee
❤❤❤❤
Sounds good man
Omg, this song is intense. *I LOVE IT.*
Great lifting song.   Get mad.
Like it 😉😉
Fucking  Love it
01:20 to 01:40 a descared and ridiculous copy of Black Metal Style
YES YES YES
This is magic
Daron is bigger than the drums. Bigger than the bass. Bigger than the voice.  In his own mind
El comentario en español que buscabas
Increíble son geniales!!!
I couldn't help crying with this song, thinking about the war and how many people hurt, but there are more of us who want peace, it makes me think of both Armenia and my country Colombia.
when the world needed them the most.... they came back
1:10 - 1:20 best part in my opinion
daron da besttt
Marcos Mion kkk
I listen to this song every time I study     I'm sure everyone is like that :)
Esta gente si que sabe volver fuerte
I'm very happy with these songs but what does need to happen to you solve your f**king diferences and compose a new album? Can't you see how hypocrite is to say against war while you aren't able to solve tiny personal problemas? As a fan I am very happy with these two new songs but I'm can't believe this is all you can do out of your selfishness and nothing more. We are living a pandemic, many things can happen, people are dying, maybe relatives of ours, maybe even us, or even one of you four could being dead now, and I think that if this extreme situation couldn't make you reconsider some principles, it's because great parts of your lyrics were just a lie to earn money trying to send “being in peace” and “war is wrong”.
New Album plsssssss❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ world with u
Как будто и не было этих 15-ти лет молчания. Браво!!!
This was hella awesome
Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

*Serj, Daron, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!*
Sistem of a Down es puro poder en una sola banda. Los mejores 😎🤘
How good to see you guys together again after so many years. Maybe a new album ?? I'm sure many of your fans will be very, very happy.
There was no genocide before, as it has not been done now.
I love you guys !  What a scream of war !  The devil is at our doors, be ready Patriots !!
Today is 31st March.  It is a day, when 103 years ago in 1918, armenian soldiers entered Baku and killed over 12 000 Azerbaijani civilians, including women, kids and old people. Why every country should recognize armenian genocide, if they don't also recognize crimes, which they did?
AAAAAGGGGHHHH I LOVE Y'ALL SO MUCHHHHH
wtf is this shit and thats not my band
wtf is this shig
System of a down is fucking awesome. They sure blow my balls off.
This shit is heavy as BALLS. I can listen to this all day. It sounds like that they had just picked up were they where. And made all the system of a down fans blow there faces off.
Beautiful song in today's world we need more
That shit is fire 🔥 🔥
I am so thankful these guys are back. This is old SoaD, Serj has to have the main vocals and go on that journey. I love me some System... This sounds like the System I love
Daron is my fav
Awesome song!!! Remind Cigaro..
Please make more songs we miss you!!!
Epilepsy warning
Would be even better if it was only serj singing

Awesome song! \m/_\m/👍I can’t wait to hear more new songs from SOAD, as you guys rule! And please tell me Serj, Daron, Shavo, & John that a new album is soon coming out.🙏
Anjrit lagunya sulit buat di nyanyikan
Thank God SOAD. For giving the world not just a amazing new song: But a song that Tells the story and the Truth.  The Armenian People how the been Victim's of Corruptions and Geocide for over a hundred. Years.  This song sends a powerful message to the world. And the Anger that is expressed in- Tells - The  World  they  will never give up and Never give their Love of  Country and land of Armenia. Well done .. "The Prostitutes' who Prosecute have failed us from the Start.!!"  The best line or sentence I heard in a song since Stairway to Heaven.!! Keep fighting the Fight. Against  Prosecution and Terrorist around the World.!!!
Still going hard as fuck!! Love them! never changed their sound to conform. They knew they never need to create a new sound to stay awesome!!!
When you change your political spectrum from LibLeft to AuthRight because the Muslims don't like the Armenians.
😴😴
Wow! I'm doing a school project on the Nagorno Karabah conflict and this gave me goosebumps. I loved your music ever since I was a kid and your decision to raise money and awarness through music makes me want to cry, you're amazing 👏
Serj te pasaste a kaka envidioso qlo
Jesus Christ is coming back! (Get right with God before it’s to late!) this is a warning ⚠️
This is a bit too metal to be SOAD for me.
ого, кто вышел из спячки
cuanto extrañaba esta banda
Am I dreaming
JUNTOS. NO PUEDE SER♡!!!
Hi System of a Down , I used your CHOP SUEY song in my ROCKULELE music video, https://www.instagram.com/p/CMvKJzsHS00/ , which I hope you enjoy!

4K dislikes from refusing Armenian genocide Turkish people.
Thank you soad . Really you guys made my day . I have lost hope for many years . Thank you
brooo this is absolutely AMAZING i'm so glad to see this band back in action
It would be a crime If we did not get an album after this  They still got it
I like serjtankian music and the system of a down since I was a child in elementary school until now I am 33 years old. I am Indonesian.
I had a buzz on when I first heard this and I got way too excited lol. Deservedly so though.
If I could give this 33 thumbs up I would
I want to thank them personally from the bottom of my heart for trying so hard to get people to chant the right thing in order to win this war against the devil and spirituality...
Shavo getting more recognition, deserved
Things we are currently doing:  BEATING THE DEVIL  Things we never be doing: RUN FROM THE DEVIL SUMMON THE DEVIL HIDE FROM THE DEVIL

#ForaBolsonaro
So strong words! Tnx, guys! Armenians is the great and peaceful nation. From Russia with love!
THE WORLD NEEDS A NEW SYSTEM OF A DOWN ALBUM!
This Is not only good music. This is good content. From the beggining of their carreer their songs are so unique because they talk about the actuality, the craziness of modern human being, the brutality of this world. They make me feel like a part of this world, this makes me cry. Thank you for this, I love you so much
This isn’t a banger, this is straight c4.
Holy Shit ...They're  Back!!!!
DAAMN
So excited! Loved this! Use to listen to them my teenage years
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bora System vocês tem que voltar de vez😔✊
Man this is serious
❤❤❤❤ from indonesian
💜💜💜
The breakdown @1:15ish got me. 👈🏼 solid track
Bravo 👏
it's been a month and i still can't believe you guys are back, i've never felt so happy. thank you System Of A Down for existing and creating music.. i missed you guys so much.  los amo con toda mi alma.
They still got it I see
Turn 40 today and I found out my ol favorite band released a song. May be a good year after all. It's almost like u guys never left
ya estan viejos
Masters 💓
System of a down is the only band, that I can think of, to be commercially successful in the mainstream and use black metal blast beats.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear the new music, I hope I get to see them soon.
When will soad get a real drummer? We all know that the throne supports a CGI model or robot/cyborg!
why am I just now hearing this!?
Sistema on doun
Itre on
Not impressed with anything post Toxicity up until now.  01:20 that black metal segment is pure joy
думав soad нормальні але бабло рішає
Love it...
Deron loses twenty years with a simple shave lol
The chorus is melodic and hypnotizing. I'm going to use it when I announce my presense for dinner from now on.
You can definitely hear their black metal and death metal influences at 1:20. I know at least once Daron played the Transylvanian Hunger riff on stage.
Love madness in Daron eyes...he still got it. \m/
Love the song soad. I hope to see more
The best
Yes absolutely yes!!
Отличная песня в духе SOAD! Рад такому возвращению!
Es el vídeo más bonito que he visto hasta ahora
They are back to the old system of the down!
my friend: system of a down are boomers me:yeah but the best boomers
God saved Armenia
Holy Mountains seems fitting!
Serj: Guess who's comin for dinner Me: DAD?!
Suddenly I feel Armenian.
Serg is so much better in this band than his solo stuff. SO much better
Very few bands can take a 15 year hiatus and then release a song that could easily be a set opener for a gig
Respect from Albania🇦🇱🇦🇲
🇦🇲🤘🏻🇦🇲
Серëга лучший.
kumur kumur
Pqp que videoclipe foda
Наконец то,ураааааа!!!!
cañaaaaaa
Потрясающее возвращение  System Of A Down!!! THX!!!
Hearing "the genocidal humanoid" makes me feel my sins crawling on my back.
Sounds like 1995. But not good.
This makes me so happy.
Beating the devil,  we never run from the devil, we never summons the devil, we never run from the the devil. Me: check the speed....  no it is on normal. Man they sure can sing and play fast.
Is this year 2001 or what !? 🙌🏽
WoW daqui a pouco ta fazendo sucesso aqui no Brasil!!!
🔥 INDONESIA 🔥
🙌🙌🙌🙌
your = force 😱😱😱💪🏻💪🏻
Im just hear for the 5 second break down

O MY LORD, I feel like l am fifty AGAIN🤪 man l love SOAD, and have done since l first heard them all those many years ago😘🇬🇧👍
laughs in gigachad
🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼
Just want to add this song isn't new it's just them replaying it just saying
Thank you Armenia for giving us SOAD! 🇦🇲❤️
I am so crazy about this band. I really enjoyed watching it live in 2002. I love how Serj dances all the time. I feel very in (I'm in Thailand) 🇹🇭🔥🔥🔥🔥🇹🇭
たまらなくカッコイイ✨
THEY ARE BACK❗❗❗✊💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
The quality, as always :)
❤️🤘
Soad is back baby
LOL apparently SOAD is doing blast beats now! I love it!
I'm glad to see SOAD back with new music it's been 15 year at least 🤘🤘
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ♥♥♥
I love this song
Perfect music and the message to the world
Systems are DİE...
Very cool!!!!
We need more music from system of a down
they dont look like they aged at all fucking crazy
people with epilepsy probably fucking died f in chat for them
SYSTEEM VOLTOOOOOOUUU
That was fun. I'm listening to it again.
Emotional video
this is legit SOAD oldschool madness <3
At last the Kings was awake 🤟🥳🤟
I LOVE SO MUCH!!!!
Simplemente la puta polla!!! Pedazo de tema
Very weird comeback song for system in my opinion🙄
#BolsonaroGenocida Teme
#BolsonaroGenocida
Some fans: Angry Serj Tankian is amazing. Longtime fans: Always has been. No, seriously. He's been pissed this whole time, but the Armenian genocide brought them back.
Oh my fuck I can't even.  57 yo white woman fan since early 2000s. Yes you read that correctly, fuckers!
Good to see they haven’t changed literally at all
The 15 year break before releasing new content is definitely showing. Should have kept going why you were on a roll and had the magic. Once you lose it it's so hard to get it back. Older with families or not. This shit is weak in my opinion. Muscle up
The people of Armenia have no fear to be fighting their own country. Strength to them!
This just rocks
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
System of a down are back, awesome as always, even for a bit.....thank you guys 💪💪
Waiting you serj
Armenia lost the war lol
Сережка постарел
Fan since 94’ but dayum!!! Gray hair and all!!!
Recién me doy cuenta 🥺✨💖
Please for the love of god release a new album
Title of the song coresponds only with us devil amy that will controll world. The only one law is the us law,that has most countrys  destroyed. But sod makebgreat  music
amazing
System of a Down the Anime
Sadly SOAD is not back. This song is all we’re getting any time soon.
when the devil isn't so lovely anymore
Ww1q
Bize sistemin kölesi olmayın diyenler sistemin kölesi olmuş :))))
Damn surprised with black metal part🔥🔥🔥🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Immortal.
Depois de escutar essa música umas 3x eu tive a impressão de ser uma música dedicada a nosso DESGOVERNO de Bolsonaro Genocida!
I'm happy they released a new song :D
These bastards aged
a nice new soad song
Vuelvan. :,(  Ustedes son una de las razones por las que amo la música y me duele saber que están separados.
love tankian..without you in soad its like drinks tea without sugar
We, Humanity waiting for this edible to against the Devil...
Love this
cringe
holy fucking shit mojis im 13 again!
I can't believe this is real. I truly thought System of a Down would never get back together. Just when I think I have nothing new to listen to, they slap me right in the ass
АБХАЗИЯ ТАЩИТ
Siempre me han encantado y despues de que vi como asumen responsabilidad en una lucha que es de su nación, siento que los amo!
Los amoooo
System Forever
Gracias system of dom

viva el rock y abajo la bichota
Serj looks like your cool grandfather
What's Boyle from Brooklyn 99 doing here screaming though?
Plot twist the terrorist are doing this on purpose cause they’re huge fans and they want them to get back together
Wow, that was a real SOAD!!!  Just dont stop it))
Most of you don't know what's going on in Armenia and it shows
Daron should let serj sing the whole Song. His voice is just annoying! Thats why i dont like mezmerize and hypnotize as much as the other records!

My neighbor must comply or move out. This is beast....awesome stuff.
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Wow ... Power full 🇲🇨 🇵🇸
Я знаю, вы прекрасно говорите по-русски, приезжайте в Россию, дайте хоть пару концертов. Умоляю!..
Serj is daddy❤❤❤ I've had a crush on him since I was 10. 30 years old now and he still melts my heart.
1:39 ааааааааааааааааааааа
love you SOAD forever...
I would love to donate for this cause, but sadly things are not doing so good in my country either, lets tear down any autoritarist goverment
feels good to have them back
sounds better on my 50's vinyl player            ; )
I do like system of a down but I can only listen to so much at a time because his voice grates on me.
It's a very amazing 4 last years for metal 😮 - Sevendust  - Slipknot - Deftones  - SOAD   And they all do a Old School content . Really amazing ❤  And Sadly "RIP CHESTER" 😢
I don't know about you but I love this song
I feel like this is Malakian taking a piss. Very uninspired riffs. 2/5. Hopefully better comes....
alalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaaa
^^
HOLY FUCK 1:20 THOSE ARE BLASTS BEATS!! SOAD ARE DOING BLASTS NEVER WOULD'VE GUESSED I'D HEAR SOAD BLASTS FUCK YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
What is happening around the world is beautiful.
Marcus Mion entrou para a banda
Oh man, I've been waiting for more SOAD music for way too long. Better late than never, though.
Phenomenal.
How is dude in a band that's writes songs against war , bigotry, & ME instability...then supports Chump???
Blast beats in the middle ♥️♥️
FUCK YEAH
😎😎😎
Considering they broke up for a while and now they are back 10 fold because Transcaucasia is having a humanitarian crisis is crazy cool
Can't wait for a new album. God dammit 🤘
MOAR PLEASE
Welcome back
1:20 Yeah! Blastbeats! \m/
Спасибо
chavo
I love it of course but now I'm hungry for more.. I was gonna go see them live right before the lockdown started 😠
This shit sounds like an awesome anime fight scene, it’s fucking sick asf!!!
lyric please sir 🤕
Damn this is amazing! I don't think there's a System of a Down song I have yet to dislike. This song doesn't slap, it fucking punches you with brass knuckles over the head! Keep it up, guys!
Serj looks more like will farrel now.
It seems devil already beat your ass XD  GAME OF DRONES!❤️
Daron is such a good writer
Serj looks like a mad man awesome
Great
I tried, I genuinely did.... But this song f*cking sucks.
Just like Tool and Fear Inoculum it's like time hasn't passed since their last album
Lazy lyrics..these dudes are one dimensional
Smooth animation. Everything about this is excellent. Music. Concept. The fact that it's for a cause. S.O.A.D themselves and all. Thank you to all who made this possible.
Several of their old songs blended together with no new melody. They can do better sorry
They are back !

Still have hope to see them release a new album before the world comes to an end...
Angry Serj !! love it !!
Nasty u guys need. To keep maken muisc i love system of yhe dwn
see kids??? this is music🤟🏾🔥😁👌🏽
I know they're never gonna release another album and these two tracks were for a specific cause related to their country, but DAMN. Sounds like they havent aged a day.
SOAD is one band to have never let me down. Ever.
epileptics will love this ❤❤❤🤣
Не хуёвенько так...... забойненько)
Why do you delete my comments? Truth is painful  right?
Эпилептики покинули чат
Come to Tennessee
So glad to see something new from these guys. It's disturbing how the world is a lot darker than the one from Hypnotize/Mezmerize days, tho.
How the fuck am I just now finding out about this!?!? Glad you guys are back!
Tanto tempo pra fazer isso 🙄🙄🙄
Loved it! Great to see one of my favorite bands of all time releasing new music and killing it!
Miss u guys
I Like this💛 0:39 Daron's eyes... Looks like a Chinese/Japanese/Korean... ETC
Probably should have an epilepsy warning for this 😂
Too bad Serj hates making this kind of music.
Wow. They still do the misic.
when I first saw the thumbnail on this video I thought the bald headed man with the red glow on his face was Kane from command and conquer.
*See ya all after 1 decade*
If they said if they making one more album and this was the first single for it I would be excited
This song sucks!!
❤️❤️❤️
1:12 is a meme
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
M We are the much talked about resistance
milhões de brasileiros são contra esse lockdown dos governadores, prefeitos comunistas nosso presidente não batalha sozinho
right now governors and mayors of Brazilian states decree lockdown. million PIS of family that has its informal commerce go through necessity for having to close their establishments
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS, I'M PISSED AT ME
Bam
Why are the comments disabled on most of their songs now?
Man I wish this song was longer 🤘🤘
Shame whats happening to their homeland. Just another part of the military industrial complex take over.
so happy to see this in 2021 <3 dont stop!
I preferred when Serj did most of the lead vocals himself. Don't care much for this, not as melodic as some of their other stuff.
WTF is this “lonely day” author 😂🤥
Wait...! What??!!! They’re back ?
1:19 norwegian black metal vibes..

Stilll got it...despite others 🧜🏻‍♀️😘💪🏼

Only a genocidal humanoid would downvote this!
That's amazing for care to humanity
❤️❤️❤️😏❤️❤️😏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
oh racist fuckers
Armenia and Artsakh is located in the heart of Iranians my brothers💪
Fucking hell holyshit this song hits so hard dam I am so hard
Volvi a la infancia con severa banda .
I'm glad they never changed their sound. This is the SOAD we all know.
Everything is marketing.
Fvck!ng great!!! Are we witnessing another wave of good rock from different bands?
No. Im not crying! It's just -it feels so lucky to be alive and covid free. I miss you SOAD.
Ajas traen al tito fuentes a huevo. Grande SOAD
That is some good stuff. Trademark sound but not stale .
Woooo
rossiya is terroristic country!
Did you know my dad named Nigel penney
This song is as cool as their first songs that made them a  famous band
It's cool!!!✊💪
The clip is : what armenians did to azerbaijanians.. we didn't hurt civils, stupids
Fucking brilliant \m/
Thanks SOAD after all these years.Powerful Song.Love You
🌸💔
Fkn beautiful. SOAD FOREVER
glad to see you guys still made good stuff.....

Black metal riff?
Black metal riff?
It's hard to say from perspective of country that is not from this region, who's right, and who's territory it is. Armenia lost in war with Azerbejan, now they are victims. When Armenia would win, did this song still be in this way? It's like propaganda. BTW I love SOAD and Armenian have some presence in history of my country, Azers not.
Well made video. I like the zoomout at the end, showing the diaspora. <3
System of a down é vida 🤘☠️
Лучшие Армяне!
Always good
I don't know if Taika Waititi can do THIS. OMG
The melodic element to SOAD makes them so accessible. They are greater than the sum of their parts and I can’t put my finger on it.
Nice energy!
THEY BACK?
this is like a bunch of Jewish 10th grade history teachers wrote a song to get try and get their students interested in the subject but everybody just laughed.
Me: *scrolling through SOAD Music Videos, sees this and plays it, also sees how old Serj looks* "Huh, guess they were already old when they disbanded. Also, how have I not heard this song yet?" *Checks for album and sees 2020 as the date* "Wait... THEY'RE FUCKING BACK!?!?!?"
Holy shit, they didn't just release a new song, they released a fucking banger!!!
Yo pensaba que nunca iban a regresar
Yeaahhhh!
This is actually really good by all SOAD standards   SOURCE: covered toxicity in my 8th grade talent show
Love to see it.
Wtf this sucks compared to their old shit. Tried too hard
1:01 Marcos Mion
Amazingly on point!
There drummer is really starting to look like Kane from command and conquer!
Ohhh that feels soooo good to hear from you guys! we missed you so much.
ha I adore the happy endings of that animation
1:20 They released their inner Marduk  (swedish Black Metal) 😳
Круто
Хахахах
It is not justified to invade Syria.
Welcome back lads
Good as ever
OTHER TRACK IS GARBAGE THIS IS MORE LIKE IT
Wow soad is back again
SOAD showing how a band (and people) can just get on despite political disagreements and make good music.
Oh yeah that's what I love!! #SOAD rocks!
AAAAAAAAAH!!! FUCK I NEEDED THIS!!
After they've gone I went metalcore, now SOAD sounds like sweet rock to me 😅
el serj se parece un chingo al wey de molotov
👍👌👹🤘
Man I love this song
My legendary band really enjoyed this song. It's amazing. Between the song and the video clip, it's great to keep working sytem of dwon👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Malakian is God
#celia3
Ok we need less of the guitarist singing and writing lyrics.
I never saw the day!!! 😭😭
🤘🤘🤘

Anyone else think this is the single greatest get together of historical homies
Those DRUMS!
Breathtaking.... goosebumps ....best band ever please dont stop playing
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I had to look up what the significance of the purple flower in the video is. It's the symbol of the 1915 Armenian genocide -- just thought I would share for anyone else who was wondering 💜🇦🇲❤💙🧡
I LOVE all the songs of system of a down , incredible
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I punch beehives to this...
Cool
Man, this song just hits so HARD.  I love angry SOAD so much.
God fuxking dam this is tough af!! 🤟🏼
Please tell me a new album is soon to follow! This sounds like old system! That’s a very good thing
they're back?!!?!
good music!!!!!
fuel rip off
.
Idk why but watching these guys play, and seeing serj go wild is just satisfying
These guys need to making a fucking album.
Sigan así cabrones! 🇲🇽🤘🏼
you came here for 1:19
i’m better than you serj
We will never forget the Khojaly genocide committed by Armenians against Azerbaijanis!  Justice for Khojaly.🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
Dam there rlly old now lol 11 years ago they looked so young
#femaleledworld
Thanks guys ! Hope you like it too ! Et vive l'Arménie !
Marcos Mion é cover do Serj kkk
Godf******g dammit. If this is your so called "come back song", I will more than greet it with open arms. F yes, SOAD is at it's roots. Even has some blastbeats to it. Super violent shit. Keep up the good work, guys. I've been listening to this on full repeat mode for the past two days now. Greetings from Finland!
for re-listen from zero 00:10
if only korn sounded as good as soad does with their new music
Algum brasileiro aí fã do soad?
The shocking news gergely knit because rectangle admittedly crack amongst a crabby dinner. vague, gray greasy great hydrant
soad en lo personal es de los mejores grupos que hay y ojala este maravilloso grupo vuelva que dejen las diferencias y que como nosotros esperamos nos saquen un álbum para demostrar que es de las mejores bandas que pueden existir  pd:tengo 14 xd
You guys sound better than ever!  Amazing production and song writing...
Great.. SOAD 🤘😎
Meh
I LOVE YOU DARON ❤❤❤❤❤❤ DESDE ARGENTINA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please allow people from Chile to donate! We want to support.
this mv is an epileptics worst nightmare
Very few people have ever existed that can create such amazing music out of such anger
1:20 WTF SoaD is using blast beat? omg haha
they might not summon the devil but they sure do summon up good music.
Angels deserve to die and we never summon the devil. Seems like a reasonable position to me.
I love this shiiiiittttt
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👌🤟🤟🤟
Cool back again.
FINALLY.SYSTEMOFADOWN
I honestly didn't think SOAD was ever going to do anything together again. I'm glad to have been proven wrong
Thanks
Graças a Deus música nova 🙏
Amazing!!!🇦🇲✊🏻stay strong Armenia!!
WTF!?  I just found about this today.  I've been waiting for new SOAD since 2005.
Después de su último disco espere tanto una nueva canción de estos vatos y por fin aquí está, deberían hacer otro álbum alguno en dónde digan con esto se despide system of a down, larga vida a system of a down
🇦🇿🇹🇷
😍😍🥵🥵
Unsure how i feel about this.  So many emotions at once.
I thought it'd be too little too late when I finally heard a new SoaD song it's been so long. I've never been so happy to be wrong before.
Black metal riff in this song
Jesus, it's been 11 years. Nice to see ya' back.
I'ts a great Bullshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This guys know politics more than experts
marcos mion canta dms 👌
How have they not realized all of their riffs sounds way too similar? Maybe Darian knows but can't come up with anything else.
I love SOAD and good to see them back actually but not like that way. Especially this donation just a bullshit. Armenia is wrong and you know it too. And isn't it late to give a reaction or make a conversation about that?
love it
Serj look like Roger Waters
All these madness is a kind of sensation 💀🦴🖤

I hope System Of A Down would make a song about Myanmar
This makes me sad and inhuman
I was bullied so much as a kid for opposing the Iraq War in 2004. I got comfort in SOAD’s songs even as My Parents said they were fake. My mom and dad were right.
<3
deeeemmmmmn finally ....
"We never run from the devil, we never suffer the devil, we never hide from the devil..."  The line that's missing: "we never deal with the devil."
Keşke politik kimliklerini, siyasi fikirlerini bu kadar müziklerine yansıtmasalarmış. Etnik milliyetçilikten propagandadan başka bir şey değil. Şöyle düşünün Karabağ'da ki olay için Manga, Gripin ya da Mor ve Ötesi gibi bir grup çıkıyor ve ermenileri ırkçılığından ve savaş suç işlemesinde gem vuruyor. Şimdi bunun tam tersini düşünün ama bu sefer grup dünya çapında ünlü yaptığı propaganda ve manipülasyon ne kadar etkili olur düşünün bi. Hayatında hiç Türkiye ilgili bir şeyler okumamış görmemiş kıçı kırık bir brezilyalısı gelip buraya brezilyadan sevgiler ermenistan'ın yanındayız yazıyor. İşin özeti yapacağınız müziğe sokam.
Serj tankian'ın hümanistim diye ortalıkta gezip aynı zamanda ırkçı ve milliyetçi olabilmesi beni her gün daha çok şaşırtıyor.
Noise noise noise nooooiiiissssseeee nooooooiiiisssse noise noise noise nooooiiiiiissssseeeeeeee

Is it me or does he sound like a Dalek
What is in Penny's Suitcase? Travel time so much fun Time to pack up to spend time in the sun. Camping tents and trekking poles What lives inside these little holes? Prairie dogs as far as the eye can see Ready to scurry away at the sound of a sneeze. Snuggle times and funny times Being a family is all that matters. Have to keep Penny away from the mad hatters. Nature is so still and calm. Oh! Don't forget the lip balm. Tees stand so tall and strong. Wait, I didn't do anything wrong. Mommy and Daddy where did they go? Who is going to massage my little toes?Pain and scar across my head. Wish I was safe inside my little bed. It's time! Throw pennies on the ground in front of the court house, My People! Give this 2year old child  Penny Lane Ippolito in D.H.S. Fort Collins Co, a chance to have a normal life with her real family! Flim yourself littering the streets with pennies for Penny bra! ,,,,
even soad is lame nowdays..
it still feels so weird to see them back, but i love it
The good old soad is back..brace for impact

Pqp isso que é som 🤘🎧🎵
Desde Argentina 💙 Escuchando a Estos Genios 😜
I fucking love your music
Alright, Im sick of this shit. You dudes need to put your political disagreements aside ( should have years ago) and just keep it going. Sorry to say but you guys aren't shit w/o each other...even Jon. ;)
Feel like I'm dreaming ♡
a
We needed them!!! They are back!!! I like to think the world isn’t so bad now!!!!!
Karton harf nadare
Awli
BRO. Wtf. They go away and come back with socially relevant blast beats. Well worth the wait.
The more I listen to it the more I love it🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
Top 10 greatest groups of all time in any genre of music....maybe 2021 is not so b😷d...this is equivalent to Jesus coming back, which will never ever happen...but just imagine S.O.A.D. coming back...WELL NOW ITS LITERALLY A REALITY ladies & gentlemen 😇🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿...rock on baby.
black metal SOAD holy fuck
Maaanoo pqp 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
one of the best songs ive heard this year
. SOAD  I found you as angst ridden pre-teen back in 1999.. ... Its been a long ride since then... and sadly its only gotten worse for alot of us.... Excellent song as always.. this band never misses a beat... You can blindly pick ANY SOAD song from ANY album  from ANY decade... and it is even MORE relevant today than it was when they created it..........    One of the few bands that have grown... but still give that angst ridden preteen from 1999 what he still craves.... SOAD is timeless RESPECT!!!
I found this right as we started bombing Syria again.... On another note its been a long 16 years man.  So happy you're back
Bringing blast beats to the mainstream 🤘
We aint FUCKING AFRAID😁🤩😄 YOU CAN KILL ME WHILE I LOOK AT YOU THINKING, GOSH WHAT A CUTIE PIE AWW WHAT IS MAKING HIM SO GRUMPY🤗 i could just pinch those chubby cheeks
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 We are all the same person living life in a bunch of different bodies which means that every person that you meet is really YOU living in another body!!! You see, you are interacting with YOURSELF at all times and once you realize this you can achieve UNITY✨🙏✨
Serj looking like Osama now.. Or the very sneaky butler from Mr. Deeds.
huh SOAD is back?! cool cool cool cool cool
16 years too late. Bummer.
COOOOOL!!!!
This reminds me of war songs from the 60's and 50's.
Сами же за пашиняна топили, че ожидали то....
Korn !?
Something tells me they have alot of songs on the way.   The fact that our governments all around the world are doing what they are doing to us, is enough for them to come out of retirement and speak to a generation once again. 🤘
Been a big fan for years but his is trash lol
I've witnessed to many bands lose their edge, and lose that heavy sound we all love. But not for these old timers, to come back without a hitch! 🤘 these dudes are not out to meet anyone's expectations other than their own. Respect!
Frickin love this new track. Love the awesome video too, in between my epileptic fits.
So they have an amazing one of a kind singer and then the guitarist with the weird squeaky voice sings more than the actual singer. I will never get this.
Chad Turks vs Virgin Armenians
Sounds like black metal
How I missed them 🤟❤ I started listening to SOAD when it was 2009, I was like 8 years old 🤪 I'm happy that they back 😄
The animation video kinda reminds me of Harry Potter if there’s a group of Wizards and Witches defeating the Dementors
The boys are back. FUCK YEAH.!!!
So thus far this year we get some new SoaD, and Daft punk goes bye-bye. I wonder if an older rap artist is gonna drop an album next
it maybe just me but i think we all want an album like toxicity, and this has some of the melodies as the toxicity album
I cant belive they are back live this song it's the best one I've heard so far
В старом духе.Как всегда на высоте.
The lights blinded me. But it’s breathtaking as well!
New songs are badass
Ya se juntaron alv xd
SOAD is breathing!!!!!!
Job 36:4-5. Trust God!
Job 35:4-5. God hears you and is working on the solutions to your truest concern to find peace again.
Job 34:22 Job 34:24-25 Job 34:34
1:21 Black metal wow
Οk imagine they mixed this with  Attack on titan ..
what about they master Putin?What abaut Crimia???NAHUY!!!
They are just fucken RAW! Only speaking the truth! Love you guys sooooo much ❤️
They heroes have arisen!
Ребята вы мне нравитесь своей хартзмой и игрой. Думаю Армяне пошли против Русичей... Обидно не думал что будет как с Грузинами.
1:10 best moment
Cool to see something new from S.O.D.
the answer is love,anderstand?we can fight? but 4 what?political.?i think we are  in love with us,fuck the politcial an give u's kisses:)
wooo !! It is the best thing that happened to me this day greetings from Mexico thanks for this jewel
oh my god, this is so cool, I just adore this group and I really enjoy the voice of Serge Tankian, he is wonderful !! I'm from Russia, but I sat on the stream and just listened, while not understanding anything, because you are awesome guys!)) Good luck in the future, health and just a good mood😊🤗😄
Poor armenians :/ uncle america will save you !
https://youtu.be/9VvmixeowNI?t=163 whats that map mean?
thank you for speaking nothing but truth in your music yes there coming straight from the gates of hell and any that were bound to the earth will be free    plus added to the ones running rapid already all around us which is why there’s so much craziness right now   it’s only going to get 100 times worse not only that but now well be able to see them since now they’ve been given full access thanks to our elite, hollywood, government plus witches and occultist casting spells, enchantment, sacrificial rituals, sex magic, and don’t forget the very public rituals london Olympics and that Symetry video cern as well as That deepest underground train opening in the swiss alps that was straight demonic as fuck   No fear is huge people no panic stand tall stand together and faith in Jesus christ is the Main key
Epic
Ведомый зверем был вовремя остановлен, и так будит, не сыте
The flower is a reference to the symbol of the Armenian Genocide
Damn, I'm digging older looking Serj lol He looks like a mentor of the Hero's Journey or The Chosen One trope.
CAN YOU SEE US ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Id be very surprised if people still call metal satanic.
The forget-me-not purple flower is the symbol of the Armenian Genocide. We are now spread all of the world because of it and no one can ever kill or destroy us. Go ahead and try, you sons of bitches. We will only blossom stronger.
Whoever graded this video is a straight god
Is this fucking real system linked back yooooo ahhh
Woo seizure warning >.>
👏👏👏
Daaam I was a freshmen in high school when I first heard them in toxicity 2003!! And they still TOGETHER!!!!
WE NEED MORE!!!
Every album has gotten consistently less interesting.
Nice to see that they're gonna make some more music before they all get too old.
Sssssaaaaawwwwweeeeeetttt!!!!
I love song
Mais comment c est trop bon ça
Cool
SOAD with blast beats. Holy SHIT.
man, this would really need a seizure warning
wow what a let down :/
1:20 - It's a Black Metal!
that small black metal part gave such a powerful emotion
aw yeaah.. they're back!! but.. Daron, please let Serj take the frontman spot, and let him sing more..
Wow.. It reminds me rock group from UKRAINESIA : https://youtu.be/c6A1zQfzMGo
if you see a native american.. youll see what remains of a failed genocide led by the one and only AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. fun fact. natives werent considered citizens of america until june 2nd, 1924. Up until 1957 alot of states still didnt allow natives to vote. some of your parents are still alive to remember that.
SOAD back in action means the world is on a really shity period
ooh a little black metal vibe in there. I like it!
It's so weird... I was 15 when I first heard of them. I'm now 28, but I _still_ felt 15 again while this song played.
Esta es la milésima vez que escucho esto y las ganas de chillar no se van :,)
Giving me the 'Steal this Album' vibes. New System for when I crawl back underneath my rock.
Let's hunt the devils! Who wanna join?
i can't freaking believe it.. after all these years.. the boys are BACK!
Will you ever play in Poland again? Please!!
Please, dear friends, we need help in Spain, between 350 and 400 buried in 3 recent clandestine graves in Spain presumably !! This family lost a son because of a criminal mafia from the Catalan Prosecutor's Office, with 1,136 alleged crimes, youtube Santiago Royuela Samit, Facebook group Royuela File you are invited! https://youtu.be/TtX1M9TUhOU

1:10 Damn that drop is so catchy
That was a big middle finger 🖕in air !!!! We're back hard!!!!
Omg, this is incredible!
I'm glad that SOAD has only gotten better after a 15 year wait
marcos mion
It's weird seeing Serj use a mic stand.
niiice song, S.O.A.D still as cool as ever.
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
Tragam mais musicas assim pfv
Aquele BR que tu tá à procura!
Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!
Stay strong Armenia hugs from Portugal. Ohh how i miss this particular sound of SOAD :)
I missed them, now 2021 is Better!!!
I am eternally grateful for you creative talent and their usage.
Love this!!! Rock rules!!!!
#rjwd #timeforrecovery
im still thinking..how many more masterpiece like this will come out in near future..it was just..astonishing..!!!
Wow. I absolutely love this. I've been a fan since 1998.
Go Armenia!
Get that album out already, the hell are you doing dudes
IM SO GLAD SYSTEM OF A DOWN IS STILL AROUND.  I THOUGHT THEY BROKE UP.
Seeing Serj as a grey man makes me feel old.
parece forró saporra mas ta muit bom 🙏
do an epilepsy fundraising next
Breaking it on stage as usual
We need a Rage Against the Machine and System Of A Down show when this world resumes to normal!!!!
Whooooo!!!!!
I came here just to like the video
SOAD Solid 🎵🎶⚡
The drummer- I guess I’ll add blast beats
🤔this kinda sound like this one https://youtu.be/FItDAFRYZ5I

Finally !!!!!
Wait what
I’m 13 and I’m so happy I was alive for them to make just one more song. My mom tells me how she would just replay toxicity on her Walkman nonstop in high school.
15 years of waiting, with eating seeds as a pastime activity,  *finally they're returning.*
Don’t like it, I spent fucking years waiting for this band to come out with a new album. If this song is a taste, it’s a really bad taste. Better to quickly burn out than to fade away.
Wait is this a new song or is someone screwing with me???

Finally something good happened in 2021 (btw talking about the band not the  geoniced)
Las track like daft punk ?! Its really the apocalypse.
A NEW FUCKING SONG!!!
JOSSSSSSS
I like this song
Amazing!
😍😍🥰 thank you..
That's why we love SOAD! ))
Nice para um caramba!!!
System  for a down
HOLY SHIT ARE THE BOYS BACK????!!!!!
Por fin SOAD regresó !!!! 🤘🤘🤘
Старые еще могут
what????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Armenia ✊🏼 Free Armenia 🇦🇲 SPEAK THE TRUTH
Let's goooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Que canseira.. Som chato e sem criatividade nenhuma.
This is beatiful omgg
The song (guitar solos), meaning of the lyrics, and clip together are breathtaking.
I'll never forget the day back in 6th grade when this kid was trying to tell me SOAD sucks and they write meaningless lyrics. Poor sod had a very big ego and thought he was smarter than everyone else just because he had a deep voice as a 6th grader.  I hope he's since been humbled.
YYYEEEEESSSSSS they are finally back in my life 🥰🤩
Incredible! Really! And someone like Tekashi69 gets 24 million views overnight :(
God how I have missed these guys!!
One thing makes me sad,that they did the comeback because of such a scary reason.
Brutal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we never hide from the devil
2021.Best! 🎸🤟🏻
I have a lot of faith 🙏 that one day I get there I hope that one day my music will burst, whoever is helping me and subscribing to my channel I thank you 🙏
Holy shit,I know exactly what this song is about and its amazing they are bringing it to the forefront with this amazing track.
Got to you guys in 2018 best concert ever!!!!!
Summoned the devil
надеюсь вы дальше будете делать треки и не пропадете на 15 лет
The drummer still looks like a robot
No sé separen y sigan haciendo música, culeros <3 los amo
Yes !
I so love this. But you guys REAAAALLY need to put an epilepsy warning
A lot of conflict in Armenia right now, Hopefully it can all end peacefully without more bloodshed

THEY TOGETHER MAKE INTERESTING THINGS.
American imperialism is a disease
Yeeeeaaaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhh 🤘🏿🖤🤘🏿

Sixteen years waiting for them, it has worth it
Sounds good, cheers from cimahi 🍻
Brabo demais... Tá loco meu 😍🔥

We need SOAD!
Que sdds velho!! PQP! Pra arrepiar tudo.
SOAD Return
У просмотров и лайков не хватает пару нулей
thank you for being the only band to spend the years still feel the same
Can someone explain to me why so many thumbs down?
"Producer throws a bag of coke at them.this what your fans want"
Man, these feels like im in a lightshow.
This band never disappoints maaaaaannnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!
Bruh kinda cringe
Those lyrics. Holy shit they still got it
Welcome back!   They show up years later with a fucking sense of what is going on in the world. This fucking world should be held to account; and we got some new messengers.  Haha, well not new.
Make an album already
i wonder how much coke was snorted when writing this song...
Huge hope on new album  and after pandemic gone, really want to see you guys live. Please stay solid and make my dream come true. Long live SOAD !!!
Beautiful, furious and Hammering!👽💜
Feels like they never left.
system of a down and blastbeats .. never thought i would witness this
SOAD blast beats are awesome
WOW!
1:20 Love that black metal part \m/
Beside everyone being grateful that they are back. This song is extremly racist and militarist. Open up your eyes folks. There is nothing to cheer about.
1:11 looked epic with the sound
Make an ALBUM !!!!!
that sucked
DAAAAAMN it's heavy af
Some should tell the guitar players there's more than 1 fret on a guitar.
Красавцы!!!
Brazil is with you Armenia
This really sounds like old school system of a down. Amazing!
big meh
I love all of you
Waw, he's got white hair over his head, im feeling old, btw great song
Udah pada tua 🙈
No han perdido el toque...💯🖤🎸🎸🎸
Legend
System is baaaaack !!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!
A letra é impactante, mais o intrumental é fenomenal 👊🏻
I had a feeling that only something that the band was truly convicted about would bring them back together, but I wasn’t ever sure when they did it would sound this awesome.
Nice song. I loved it
I want more!!
This is cringe.
I can't believe they are back, this band got me started in the right direction

The godfathers of Drop C music!!!! Wished i could've met Shavo at my first SOAD concert.
soad changed my life and i am ecstatic to see them making new music! keep fighting!
They evolved. Blown away. Sung in sync. Woooahhiii.
Это восхитительно прекрасно
Woah. Just woke up to this. Guess I'll put on a lil make-up 🤷‍♀️
Заебись
SOAD и RATM это те группы, которые должны вернуться в строй в это нелегкое для всех время!!!
SOAD é muito bom, affs!!!
I didn't recognize Shavo with a shirt on...

А мне не зашло ((. Кроме рваного ритма и выпученных глаз должно быть ещё что то...Рекомендую подумать о смысловой нагрузке текста.
Exactly as humanity naturally is - Genocidal Humanoidz! Only Christ will save us! Welcome back in the arena, SOAD! Հետեւեալ օրը Յովհաննէս տեսաւ Յիսուսը՝ որ իրեն կու գար, եւ ըսաւ. «Ահա՛ Աստուծոյ Գառը՝ որ կը քաւէ աշխարհի մեղքը: John 1:29 Armenian
Picked up where you left off so many years ago. Sounds so good.

Living the quarantine with SOAD playlist and then this song come out.... just wow..
WE ARE FUCKING BACK BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE MAKE MORE SONGS TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!!!
Русские есть? Я тут не один в шоке с их возвращения?
Orgulho de ser fã de uma banda de metal que ainda mantém as raízes da luta contra a opressão!

system of a down é a unica banda de rock antiga que ainda nn morreu
Unexpected but they still Rock!
Muy buena de verdad! Very good indeed! 確實很好 Vraiment très bien! 本当に良いです！
Getting a little goragoth vibes from those riffs
Ohhh genial está chido...👍🤟
Thank you System of a Down, for always being about the people! I love you guys!
SOAD is just amazing mann.
Fuck the system, fuck their corona enslavement... sick people are leading us. People wake up and come together!
Now thats intensity!
Nice anti war song from syndrome of down kekw
I see why the joke is that John doesn't exist. He has no emotion.
Musica nova?
Good sound...
Nikol Pashinyan is traitor and mass murder of his Owen people! HE SEND YOUNG ARMENIAN'S to Death
When the emblem of the world came at the end of the video, felt like the land in which that kid buried the beast, is home.
Welcome back 🤙🏻
I BEG YOU FOR A NEW ALBUM! PLEASE!
Feeling a big Hypnotize/Memerize vibe here
for Armenia
Super/
I am an azerbaijani guy who fought in the Nagorno-Karabakh war. It is so sad to see my favourite band calling me such things as "devil" and "terrorist". I used to love their songs. Once my mom told me "Why are you listening songs you dont understand? They even can swear at you lol" i said "cmon mom these are so cool" mom was right. They were really cursing at my race. Sad. SOAD is done for me
Привет, гляньте группу manapart
Their getting old. But Their music still same.....🤟🤟🤟🤎🖤🖤💜💖💚💓💓💗💽🎸🎹📀
So... How did they convince Serj to do his job again? Happy to notice they've not lost their touch.
Жаль что причиной столь долгожданного воссоединения стала столь печальная причина...
that bass guitar looks frikken awesome!!
Fico feliz em saber que vocês mantém o mesmo estilo, escuto essa banda desde os 12 anos de idade.
Man this should had a epilepsy advice.
I am nowhere CHILD it never matter          if this world is diying
From malaysia with love🤘
It sounds like all of your stuff done before, nothing new to improve to a new thing. Bla bla bla
serj/Soad are my god ✌🏻
My “clock” just walked right through the door!
Woah, Epilepsy Warning
I miss when serj wasnt the back up singer.
Хорошая песня и хорошая музыка от хорошей группы. Рад что вы вернулись, но повод грустный. Спасибо вам большое за то что вы есть. Мира тебе братская Армения! 🇦🇲🇺🇦🇷🇺 Простой народ из Украины и России сопереживает вашей утрате.
Daron wrote the whole song, music and lyrics, wow what a fucking legend.
Human, metal version of Wall-E
Jams
So good to have you back, SoaD. Don't stop. Keep going!
Great song❗
This sounds amazing! Pleasure for my ears. Complete eargasm ♥ Oh and I see Daron still rocking the Chop Suey look in 2021 :o
THERE BAAACK!!!!!! Im so happy, iwas starting think they would never be back. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hope to hear more soon.
Brazil is still in darkness
this is something.. glad to have you back guys
Es hermoso escucharlos, mejor canción no pudieron hacer, reflexiva, triste pero más que nada con coraje con lo que pasa en el mundo.
Just wanted to say: ...like wine. :)
SOAD's absence is why shit has hit the fan. It's okay everyone, they're back.
Free Palestine!!!
The Cartoonicturized "boy" in video is inaccurate... His eyes should be bulging as the BG-singer who looks like he "summoned the devil".
15 years has passed right? Because the legends still look and sound as good as back when they hit pause.
super bad ass
been way to long i missed this band soooo much
I may or may not have thrown too many parties to celebrate their return.
😍😍😍
Track is good, but the video is not. The shaky camera is giving me a seizures.
How tf is this in the "gaming" catigory and why does my school block out this song specifically aswell as protect the land
We will never forget the the crime you've made.✊✊✊🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
0:29 Rick Grimes is that you?
S.A. is here 💚S.O.A.D. 🇿🇦
Даёшь новый альбом!!!
Блять, спасибо, что выпустили спустя столько времени ебать .........
Pacifists to warmongers. The boer mentality definitely got into soad
A song that hit you so much!!
yooooooooo
I listened to their music for more than 12 years and they still sound great, one of my favorite bands is back
El batero es facho
Esta canción habría sido genial en los 2000
malaso
Boring
魅力はないな
THX for all! Another songs please!
АХАХАХАХА ДЕВАЧКИ Я ПЛАЧУ СПАСИБО ВАМ!
SSYYYYSTEMMM AREE BACKKKKKKKK
тема просто бомба!!!
It's sad that there's not a single shot with the whole band. Looks like they all were filmed separately. After a bit of thinking over: still, that's awesome that they decided to work together one more time. And the things they sing about are more saddening than what is written above.
Love you guys so much. 🖤
Split up  😭 fight 😭😭😭😢
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
How could I missed this new song?
Its been over 2 weeks and I still have chills
Mezmerize in one song.
why the comments from the other songs were removed?? we all like to see all the comments talking about the masterpiece from all your stuff, SOAD.
Whaaaa?
druugs
Goes hard as fuuuuck 🔥🔥
Yo pagaría por que no se separen chicos, son dos partes de algo tan bello como SOAD.
Me mama
Interesting that when people are in a time of need they remember there is a spiritual realm of the devil and God.
1:20
I'm really grateful for the songs and I hope the situation is over soon. But it pains me that it was literally a war needed for these guys to make music together again.
My life proliferates because music is still here to purify my soul I hope with these artists maybe one day we don't forget we all come from our Mother Earth. We are all brothers, no matter how conservative or orthodox we may be. May peace and wisdom spread like wildfire.
miguel of coco?
epilepsy warning
復活〜おめでとう㊗!
So good on so many levels. Still rocking better rhan bands half their age, and more importantly, writing music for a reason.
Daron Malakian is a metal god. Nuff said....he writes everything and still is rocking out...so badass 😜👍🖤🖤🤘
Thank you. Replenishing the mental ranks since a violent pornography.
Gruzja.! 😂 👍👍👍
CAAAAARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm def stealing this album!
Well fk the fk yeah!!
Racist pigs
I didn't think they would be back together I guess Armenia lives do matter
that was a hell of a song  \m/
Чем рисовать мультики и  ебашить на гитаре, лучше бы готовились к войне. Изучить матчасть никогда не бывает вредно.
seizure warning !!!!!!
They should do a black metal album. NOW.
TÁ POOOOORRAAA!
Quit fighting and make more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Брависсимо
👍...👍
FUCKIN BLAST BEAT!!! (Finally!!) Love that
O Serj tá igual o Marcos Mion Hhahahsahusaus
Господи, остановись, время, он седеет(((
some time has passed but SOAD is still SOAD, the good old juicy SOADness is intact
Serj is a god
boi 2021 is lit
Lil Uzi Vert would be so mad
Father: let Dad play you some proper music Son: but Dad they are so old Father: BOOM! BOUNCE! S.O.A.D is life!! Son: Father I want Chop Suey...
I'm hard right now. I was talking about them needing to do something just a few days ago. Glad there is still hope!
Tour Australia 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
Humans are not aware of the Genocide that's about to take place... The population of this planet is about to be reduced, soon.   #vaccines
Black Metal style 🤘🏻😈

Ripperrrrr!!!!!!!!
Ce groupe est trop bien
WE Summon SOAD :D  I Love u Guys after 16years Much LOVE For U :*
Listening SOAD is making a millenial feel 15 years younger :)
Wow..they are still alive! Last time I listen to SOAD I was a child..  Like the message of the song.. just don’t think many people will actually understand it.
этот драйв просто рвет.....
I love that Black Metal touch they gave to the song. Nice!
korny .
Support to Armenia from Venezuela
Great to see how despite different visions in making music, SOAD can just come together flawless for one cause: The plight of the Armenians.
BR da like!
For 🇦🇲 ARMENIA!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS!!! FROM GREECE 🇬🇷 🧡💙❤
Damn
O my goodness hope a CD come out cause do not want download thank you about time love you all
I hate the reason they felt they needed to make the music but I also love the music :c the world sucks and soad is great. I hope the fact that they made these songs means they can push through a full album and a tour together.
Daron's writing skills and Ser's masterful vocals. The best. Shavo just an all around nice guy. Too bad the drummer is an insecure asshole. He's good, but replaceable.
Mash dengan tema yang sama
PORRA! QUE SAUDADE DESSA BANDA!!!!
Sounds like SOAD
I think I'm gonna play this video for my epileptic friend so I can say they're amazing at moshing. Did it so well they went to the hospital.
Funny how the calmest guy in the band is the drummer
Sem palavras  Banda sensacional  I Love soad
that is a amazing song <3
I really hope they're back and not just a side gig..they have soo much to say after everything going on in the world.
sinceramente me gusto mucho el video
good to see them back but these couple new songs all sound rushed as though they just wanted to push something out. yes i know its in response to the war in their homeland but the songs just seems really forced. hopefully if they do a full album it will be more natural and more classic System
The kings themselves have returned welcome back
🥀
A Soad dose to: * You; *  me; * us;  * them It's amazing!
Please come back
this is more like the old SOAD!
For the ones who dislike it  What the fuck is wrong with you?!
New one?
I need more of this,  please ahhhh
YAŞASIN IRKIMIZ ÇİNE BEDEL KIRKIMIZ
Make me feel like I'm in the desert with just a little bit of water.. DYING FOR MORE..
Simply amazing. 👏
Them getting back together is the equivalent of the avatar returning.
Yes YESSSSS!!! We needed this with the music now sad I'm 24 and have to listen to old music and the radio is never on even the rock stations isn't rock what happened. Why......
you lost the war
Что же вам не жилось под теплым крылом матушки России???  Жили бы в мире и благоденствии как последние 100 лет.
Cool
Nagorno Karabah is Armenia, Kosovo is Serbia,dont let devils slave ocupation 🇦🇲🇷🇸
👏

🔥
Yeah, talk about the scamdemic and you'll get some cash....nah, cant wont
🇧🇷👊
Remember that this song is about armenians once again being persecuted and expelled from their ancestral lands by turks(-azeris).
I love you (THAILAND)
please drop the lyric 😃

The prostitutes guns who prosecute have failed us from the start! - are we talking about Russia?

Great song for a noble cause🇦🇲
I will listen to your songs until I die... These songs are too beautiful ...❤
Legend is back🎉
I just cried soad is back
Talented musicians
Maybe if they changed their name to Daron and the System Of A Down, then his inflated ego and insecurities could be sated enough for the band to continue
Gosh, there are even as terrible as they were in the early millenium...
The devil hath vacated his seat after this ridiculously amazing music to get concert tickets for 2021!!!!!
Soad a sido mi banda fabority desde el 2009 !! Es una banda diferente !! La mejor
Beauty. Absolutely AMAZING!! I will always love System Of a Down. Beautiful animation and song.
Wow this gave me goosebumps. This is something else 😳
hard.
1:38 EPIC EXPRESSIONS SERJ
🤘😈👁️
Are they back?!?!?
This is the SOAD I know and love... WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG!? 🤘😅🖤
Why you guys make a song for armenian but nothing for Palestinian?
Finally some good music
Hmmm...I dont know man...I'm just not feeling it....its SOAD no doubt, but it's not right...there's something missing ...like its generic.....I'll give a few more spins out of respect for SOAD but...meh
Brazil 👀🇧🇷
Normally when older bands once known as badass that have faded away try to come back I just can’t get into it. this sounds like it came out years ago. Fuckin love it
We get a new song and we get to donate to good cause? Me likey

Poucas bandas perpetuam  seu estilo. SOAD, continuem... por favor. O planeta precisa dessa idéia, continuar... Obrigado por fazerem parte da trilha sonora da  minha vida!
This song is perfect with attack on titan
They're back🤩
The creativity is still there oh my goodness the story behind this is crazy it kinda pisses me off that nobody in the comments mentions this System of a Down was always the band to speak on issues with people in general
System of a Down, with extra blastbeats? Yes please XD
BEAUTIFULLLL
Rick Grimes singing

I've been waiting for this for 15 years. LOL

До чего они крутые Система дала сбой лучшие 🎸 🥁 🎵🎧👍🏻
SOAD ❤️ from Tajikistan 🇹🇯
OMG YES!!!!!
And yet, their drummer manages to be a reactionary boot licker. Go figure.
Nice
Foda!
Is SOAD back for good or just for a couple songs? Anyone knows?
Our world needs you back!! Make more SAOD music!
Playing speed to 0.75 👍 More Heavy
Now this is the real deal
Please, my heart is with you Armenia
Wow they look younger then before and that song was a fresh breath of sound.Kmfdm say I guess they know where the fountain of youth is dang it
From original SOAD self-titled album (booklet) 1995  "As the century nears its formidable end, our global experience of universal proportions, predicted by many greats, will arrive at our solar system, to our system of a down.  Authoritarian oppression, family abuse, depression caused by conformity, and economic devastation will be neutralized by technological terrorism in times of complete chaos."   SOAD manifesto mentioned war is unavoidable but instead of conformity we should all oppose and stand together 👊
YEAAHHHHHH!!!!!
Make more
He lives in NZ. Is this about the PM Jacinda Adern the devil destroying NZ.
GREAT MUSIC AND VIDEO CLIP FROM THE BAND SYSTEM OF A DOWN!
Демоны это азербайджанцы? Что ж не разу не расизм.

Soad 2021.... hell yeahh...!!!!
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT SYSTEM OF A DOWN NEVER SOLD THEIR SOULS TO THE DEEP STATE DEVIL SWAMP!! THUS THEY HAVE STAYED OUT OF THE BUSINESSES FOR AGES!! THEIR "PIZZA PIE" IS A REVELATION WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE ONES FOLLOWING, MAJESTY LORD SATAN THE ONE THAT CROSSED OVER, ARE UP TO!!! HOLLYWEIRD EL-ITE, WHERE ARE THEY BY THE WAY??? And YOU SHOULD REALLY DIG INTO WHAT S.O.A.D SAYS IN THEIR LYRICS!!! SCIENCE IS ANOTHER ONE YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND!!  SCIENCE HAS TOTALLY FAILED MOTHER EARTH AS IT HAS FULLY TURNED INTO A RELIGION OF SCIENTISM!!!! AND JUST TO DRIVE HOME THIS POINT!!!!! ANY GROUP THAT PUTS THINGS LIKE THIS INTO THEIR LYRICS, ARE TELLING YOU SOMETHING BOYS AND GIRLS!! YOU ROCKERS SHOULD HAVE IT WAY EASIER TO QUESTION WHAT THEY TRY TO CONVEY, THEN WHAT THE "ELEVATOR SOUNDTRACK" LISTENERS HAVE!!! IM A ROCKER BECAUSE OF MY REBELLIOUS ANTI CONFORMITY "GENE"!! SCHOOL WAS PROGRAMMING AS WAS RELIGION, HOW THE FUCK CAN THEY WITH A MIRROR SEE 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000... MILES AWAY OR 13,3 BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY????? RHCP DIDN'T PUT IN "SPACE MIGHT BE THE FINAL FRONTIER BUT IT'S MADE IN A HOLLYWEIRD BASEMENT", JUST BECAUSE IT CAME TO THEM ONE "FOGGY" NIGHT...... BUT THEN, I MIGHT BE WAY MORE REBELLIOUS ANTI CONFORMITY THEN YOU?? BECAUSE YOU MIGHT JUST BE A ROCKER BECAUSE OTHERS ARE!? PROOF!! WELL LOOK AT MY NAME AND KNOW THAT I ALWAYS, ALWAYS STOOD WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE STAGE WHERE THE ARTISTS PERFORMED, AND LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE FACES OF THE THOUSANDS IN THE CROWD!!!!! DARE GO AGAINST THE HERD OF SHEEPLE THAT ARE WALKING TOWARDS THEIR OWN ENSLAVEMENT WILLINGLY, "BECAUSE THE AUTHORITY TOLD THEM IT'S THE SAFEST WAY TRUST US"... 🖕 YOU!!!!!!
Hermoso!😎😊
I love soad from japan.Im 22 years old!
THEM GOT BAAAAAAAACK !!!!!!
Der beste Weg um das Morden auf sieser Welt zu beenden ist die Zerstörung der Logistik der USA- Truppen
This song is very good for headbanging. but to bad Armenia lost the war
S.O.A.D 1  VS MILLIONS OF REGGUAETOON SINGERS 0 FOR EVER XD
Talk about a fall from grace. This song is what Saint Anger was to Metallica!
Talk about Chinese genocide if you got any balls. America ain't the devil.
bring back the old soad
New music please!!
man, this is so shite
I've been listening to your guy's old albums for almost 20 years lol so nice SOAD is making songs again!!!
🤯
Powerfull!
You can see the douchness in the drummers face. relax buddy, it's music.
Where the hell is the new album?  I can't take it anymore, you don't have a new song together, but to make a song for a "Beneficent Campaign" (not that it's bad, it's great) to promote yourself, you do.  I'm being honest, but I don't care, I want new songs, new albums, I want the NEW, do you understand me?  I'm a big fan of you, your songs are in my blood, but damn it, stop this fight as if it were "hungry girls", get together soon, and release a new album.  My name is Pedro de Jesus (Pedrão), from the city of São Paulo (South Zone), Brazil.  I WANT A NEW ALBUM, I WANT NEW SONGS, WAKE UP!!!!!!
cant believe armenians of all people would support the disarming of american citizens
I love you guys.
has anyone EVER seen John Dolmayan smile?
This is an EPIC song about the Liberal Left
Único comentario en español jeje
I love it!!!
I’ve missed you guys but idk about this single.
Brasil 🇧🇷
buena cancion
No han perdido ese sonido legendario que tienen saquen un disco se les hecha de menos no mas mierdaton en latino América
Awesome music, it's been a while since I haven't heard this group's songs!
Скажу коротко- Вы крутые
Finally
помним и требуем 1917-2021
Hmmm i wanted a new album for so long that i think my expectations became too much. so far i do NOT even remotely like these new tunes so far. this seems extremely phoned in. specially after a what... 15 year break???
So good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovPTVnA2wD0
Só de ver eles tocando junto... é muito bom
ARMENIA + Forever
Did I smoke too much of Shavo's weed or did System just release a new song!?😲😲😲😲😲😲
Wanted to listen to some soad, so i typed it in and this popped up. At first I thought I'm seeing things, I thought that they will never release something new.
Took another war for serj to come sing in system again...
EITAAAA PORRAA! Olha só quem voltou com tudo🤘
These new songs are so damn boring 🤮
wow this is trash.
As a huge SOAD fan.. when i initially heard this song, i was highly skeptical of it. But after giving it a few listens, I see the direction they went with and its pretty great.   Please put your differences aside and come back to us when we need you most with so many fronts and divides in today's modern america where music is also dead
we never summon the devil
Oh, how you have been MISSED!!!!
Awesome
Finally... they come back
That bass is absolutely gorgeous.
New album coming soon?
Theres a portion of a black metal guitar tone
I can say I’m a bit confused
Omg i love him so much finally we meet
Daron Malakian going all out this time
DON'T MERCY TO A ARMENİAN
2:21 is such a cool part :D Yes the whole song is amazing but specially that part for me!
🤘🇷🇺
YES! I got chills and SOAD still got it!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it
nice!
Será que sou o único brasileiro a apreciar essa obra de arte?
1 serj looks scary 2 strobe light warning
Reminds me of when I saw these legends live here in Melbourne. AWESOME!
I'm surprised that none caught the "Diablo Tristram" riff :P
Liked before watching. ❤️
I fucking love SOAD... This song is incredible. I can't wait for more.
In this rapidly changing world, it gives you comfort when someone reminds you of what used to feel like listening to a certain band. PS: I'M SO HAPPY!
come back and make this world better...
I'm with you 🇦🇲 ❤️ From Egypt
HELL YES! I LOVE THE NEW SOAD
"ITS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER" THANKYOU GUYS
Love it !
I have a feeling this might be their last music video. What a great song
1:11 i love this part

Нормально наверное вырасти, состояться и жить на западе и  в то же время мочить за Карабах-Арцах сейчас...Где вы раньше то были..
Blast beat? Fuck yes
Dammmmmm !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ImI !!!!!!
Байроктов испугались? Это возмездие...
так себе, в начале нулевых было гораздо лучше
Please, new album, band
azeriler kendi topraklarını geri aldılar, bir de utanmadan bunun için bağış topluyorsunuz
I will always Appreciate the fuck out of SOAD #IStandWithArtsakh`
Conciencia aunque duela!
great song !! welcome back SOAD ..
1 more album please. Do it for the fans. You're welcome
Love system of a down and now it's better because the band is back keep rocking Serj
this is the first time i waited years for something i had high hopes of and it fucking flew over my expectations at the ISS orbit!
Regresaron
this need 1 Md again for SOAD
This song has different genres 😂  0:10 Hard Rock 0:28 Metalcore 0:57 Hardcore Punk 1:11 Extreme Metal 1:21 Black Metal 1:40 Nu Metal
Saudade de ver vcs tocando juntos❤️
Just invidel 4 u.. ..think where u are
Fucking SERJ!!!!! 15 years waiting for this and it is happening!!! Long Live SOAD!!!
Over a decade of absence, but you still got it. Keep up the awesome work!
There is a black metal elements in this song
\n/_
Marsh mallow  taking over
Вечная истина) мир спасёт любовь. Рад вас видеть вместе
The world needs a SOAD and Jinjer co-lab.
They're ba'aa'ack!I They sound as if they never left you know, like other bands whom we need not mention
OMG
This was almost cool but then Primadonna-Daron shows his face going "Look at me! Look at me!!" and kills it. Sounds good in studio but dewd can't play worth a fuck live.
he... is.... the Pain Killer!!!
After a 15 year Hiatus this video is awesome...#SOAD
Donde puedo darle 1000000000000 likes a esta canción, es magnifica!!!!
15 years, not missing a beat.
I'd just love if they'd let Serj sing alone and keep it that way...having Daron sing occasionally is absolutely fine, but diluting serj's incredible voice seems like a waste of musical epicness
Бортич привет
Я думал они аполитичные
Galak nih lagu
WECOME BACK SYSTEM OF A DOWN..... TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH....
😳...Woah...I thought I was back in the days of spiders...Epic Comeback!
I was there gandalf, i was there 15 years ago
https://systemofadown.com/splash/ - Как?
Wow the rev starts now
I know they have no good terms wtih Turkish people but I freakin' love em.
#Serj...#soad..is back..and I'm loving it
hai gaess iknow what
the clip inspired by Mass Hysteria ??!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsJVmiqf8VA
our history in one song, thanks so much SOAD!
Not a bad song. Will be interesting to see how they do this live.
I LOVE all of you boys
Gold
This song slaps so hard )) It should have blown youtube
How toxic is this song ?
I missed them.   They sound so good.
Hey Serj, sorry to let you know but I am a republican listening to your music. Since thats a problem for you
It's nice to see a band i listened to in high school pushing similar lyrics going into my 30s.   Good shit.
@_@ So beautiful
Wow, they pushes the high pressure button. Cool riffing, i've never been into SOAD, still knowing a few songs -on heavy rotation, in 90's./00's! A consequent heavy and tough album, would be worth, to check up..
AMO esta banda qwq
I love how their sound is the same ❤ That is refreshing.
When someone asking "what is epic comeback", show them this!!
I'm glad too that they stayed true to their style but ....part of their style is to , at some point during a song , hammer us with something to bang to ...i'm still waiting ... to be clear ...staying true to your initial style  does not give you license to hand us just ANYTHING !
Boring
SOAD forever!!
Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

They're still the best
3k dislikes, but WHY?
THIS SONG IS A HIT !!!
What is absolutely amazing to me as an American citizen System of a Down has been the voice for their country since the beginning. I honor what they do is very Noble. They have to be amazing people would be an honor to meet them I know me personally definitely one of the greatest rock bands ever hands down keep up the good work guys much love from Virginia
What a voice!
Clássico Serjão do Sistema Feudal
Nostalgic in 4K
innocent school boy symbolizes armenian people huh really?
Aguante SOAD!!!
Disappointing after waiting so long.
So... can someone back me up on the Armenia situation. I promise I am not undermining it I just don’t know everything about it
I’ve missed you so much soad
Epic
Serj parecendo o Marcos Mion
Beautiful.
Did John and Serj resolve their political differences?
lima peruuuuuuuu
W końcu ktoś prawdę powiedział w tych... czasach o co w nich chodzi
Am I dead?
The forget me nots are making me cry awww The animation is amazing
Brasil ? 🇧🇷
1:20 *black metal* SOAD
*CAPITALISM SUCKS*
Brutal !
Sound alot like the first album
Wow perfect video 🤯, SOAD you’re the best 🔥🎸
😳😻👍👏
i fuking love this
HELL YEAH
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Terorizer ....back. nice
Я ппц как рад, что они вернулись, но для настоящего творчества нужны эмоции . Очень жаль, что  причина этих эмоций такая
I thought -  "rock is dead". And I will die before rock returns. But rock comes back and lives forever
damn im old good riddance fancy rock guys
No way there finally back !! There my favorite band
HELL YEAH!
SOAD with blasts :0
WOOOOO They sound just like SOAD!
Love to see the hiatus is finally over💙💙💙💙💙💙
The final clip, above from Arabic Penninsula.... Fuuuck amazing!! 🙏🏻 Thanks for back again on this magnificent way.
They look so old
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘💪
soy yo o la bandera que usaron fue la de Colombia al revés?
vamoooooooooo   carajooooooooo se los extrañaba  muchachos afilados como hace 15 años atras
<3
In these times, It is a relief to hear the voices of the like-minded kin rise once again. You have been missed. Welcome back, SOAD.
Eu estava vivaaaaa para esse diaaaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
system of a down is going through the dark clothing album type of phase
love uuu
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:10 That timing between music and video is perfect👏👍
PURPLE is the right colour which is green
Thank you <3
Wow jus stumbled across this and luckily! What a treat just like the old stuff
Yeaaaaahhh!
Perfeito.
Fuck yeaaaeeaaah 😍
The group is pretty old
How long has it been? Well it was worth the wait.
Me encanta esto.
So jealous that I won't be able to catch them on their tour.   I saw them play in Pensacola, Florida in 2005 ( maybe 2006) and that night has gone down in history! ( not as a sad Statue of Liberty and a Generation that didn't agree)
Foda pra caralho
Que delícia! Acho que até hoje eu ja tinha ouvido TUDO do SOAD e do Serj. Agora fui agraciado com essa faixa.
🌋💥💣
They never summon the devil...oh ok then clears a lot up.
BIG SUPPORT TO THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE <3 <3 <3
Whoooaaa....👹👹👹 System playing black metal riffs,AND actually sounded really good!! I mean,even tho I'm an xtreme metal fan,but honestly guys,I've been an SOAD fan way back since '98...but really and truly,after learning about what you and your countrymen have endured....man,you could send me a blank CD and I'll still pay you a limited edition Box set price🤑🤑🤑 Respect to all of yas...😔😔😔 F**k the f**king 🖕oppressors🖕man,they're making me sick🤮🥵🤢
Brooooooo this goes down haaaard  fuck yeah!!!
trve
Fucking nice!!!! Just loved seeing them all play together again with something new gave me warm fuzzies inside 😄
Lackluster
THEY'RE BACK OMGG😭😍
Que isso camarada ?!!!!
I love Old school sftd
I've missed you so much guys, your music helped me in my darkest moments and I really hope that we'll help you with this campaign.
Eu sobrevivi a uma pandemia mundial pra depois ver o system voltar ❤️
Colombia los espera de vuelta !
Ааааааааааааааа!!!!
Speachless! Brilliance at its best!
Sorry guys...love you but this song sucks
It's ironic this comes out at a time where the world is facing an attempted GLOBAL GENOCIDE under the guise of the largest hoax perpetuated "Covid-19" and they don't even realize it...
So great!! Please make more, we've all been waiting for your comeback!!
https://youtu.be/nTxZ5tyW8KY doing my part Serj! Love your political music 🤟💀
Oooh fuck yes!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌋💞
BREATHTAKING
Never thought I'd see SOAD back together... This just made my freakin' day!🤘🏼
oooooooooooh yeah
I’ve waited and waited many years for a new SOAD song and the wait was well worth it.  Best 2:49min ever \m/
I'm becoming epileptic after this but is ok
смотрю серж начал работать над вокалом снова.что не может не радовать
the demon is Azerbaiyán
SOAD BACK! 👌
Why are the ge and h in lowercase? If there's no reason it's soooo dumb...
Thank god they’re back 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I used to like-ish this, but nowadays: meh..just my opinion. they are really great and glad to see them back many years ago
What about having sex with the devil??
Literally the first time I respect Daron after seeing this video. Actually putting some effort into being in the same room as the rest of the guys. Unlike John.
Africa: where is my flowers?
🙏...hope to see you in South Africa post the pandemic
Good sound...
Épico! Fantásticos.
What means a purple flower ?
Love from Indonesia!
just have fired my heart
You must stop your bad fancy .. this is damage for armenian and azerbaijanian people
I never thought this day would come.
True love
Finally, big come bck
WEEEENAAAAAAAAAA SSSHMMMMMMRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Как же они скатились, просто пиздец
me in 2021 seeing this: they returned  :')
Just wish Daron would accept to stfu a little more and S.O.A.D could make a new album
Cadê os br viciadaaaaaoo??🤘🤩🤩🤩
👁️👄👁️ they're back...
Thank God for SOAD 🤩
I don't understand how their sound remains so original so many years later. I bow before this band
I-
🖤
Saudi Arabia love Armenia 🇸🇦❤🇦🇲
LOVE YOU DARON !!!!!
Didn't take me long to learn every word to this song. I sing it in my sleep. Love it.  \m/ o_0 \m/
I love this song 👍
All of them have aged really well
Questa canzone ha un significato bellissimo
YES!, ❤️💙💛🙏🌹🌺🌷🌻🌼😘😘❤️💙💛🙏🙏🙏🙏🇦🇲
such a good a lonely day after viewing
This is Cool
Excellent Work A+++
☺
Only wish I had bigger speakers right now
Sono tornati!!!!!!
Yes🌷
Hi from Ukraine, my homeland currently suffering from russian occupation, but i want to say this: seems like SOAD can gather and work together again only during their motherland's hardest times, and im kinda like this times, im sorry.
Totally miss you guys, you were in my top 3 of favorite bands when I was a teenager. The world of music is completely different without you :'(
Finally
friends of sistem of a down I hope you listen to your people and that these two songs are singles from a new album that can be composed of 8 other songs believe me that it would be something great for everyone as fans of the best metal rock band in the world, I think that it is fair for his followers to give us this after 15 years
Meh.
That guy got so fat. He's been out of shape since the BYOB video
Not bad.. But considering that long absent fans were expecting something that it would blow their minds.. SOAD good as always but this did not blow me
OH MY GODDDDDD THEY'RE BAAAAACKKKK
Sounds like QOTSA.
THEY'RE BACK?!?!?!?!?!?
Wow!! S.O.A.D. still got it! This is a great song! Nice video too!!
Sistema de bajo siempre fue mi idolo
The chemistry is still there!!!
Foda demais!!!
Serj is really looking older, but still looks and sounds great!
Big return....
We'll come
Pogchamp
Este grupo es el mejor del mundo
E p i l e p s y
Now I feel it will be the best album that has been in a long time, you have accumulated a lot, reflecting the short maturity period, strong experienced and effective ... We expect the sun to set and set ...
Banana banana banana banana terracotta banana terracotta terracotta pie

THIS IS FIRE Omg
I will never be tired of listening to SOAD!! listening to them since 15 years and still.
1:21 felt the black metal for a second
Thats a fucking masterpiece
SOAD please never stop making music. We all yearn for a new album
Attack on Titan leaked footages
#armeniasupportterror
1:20 SOAD goes Black Metal
Booooooring... Did they lost their balls somewhere?
Imagine living in Los Angeles and wanting territory for a country you would never live in and insulting the people of another country. He is nothing but a racist attention seeker hiding behind 'humanism'.
Hella cool video!
Гуляешь по городу, а там армяне в нарды играют

Thank you 💗

🥰🥰🥰
is there a new album coming up ? I hope so !
Like this version of Borat
Out-fucking-standing
Ficou muito foda !!
burn baby burn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💪
Tool puts out a new album in 13 years, and SOAD does in 11 years, what a time to be alive!!!
01:19 Descending into Black Metal
Dağlık Karabağ Azerbaycan ın dır !!
армяне мощь!
Now that's something...my ears were craving for...🤘hellyeah...S.O.A.D
Anyone else think this song would sound even more awesome with some screams in it
the best soad
They alerted always a good band until they messed with the illuminati. .. then they fell off Ghats why they are trying to catch.up.... when you needs wiith the devil you lose brothas, while you are playing catch up the garbage devil remains supreme
Pobre guitarra XD
thanks
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
The symbolism 💜🤗
System of a Down got me through the Army back in 2003!! SOD is what is should be!
Viva o System of a Down!!! Original reality
Never thought I'd see a new song lets GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Cade os BR caraio??? SONZERA!!!
Salam metal😀👍
#armeniastrong
Awesome
ya hacia falta buena música nueva, es señal de que no todo está perdido

Fuuuuuuuck <3
1:11 Just, fire
10/10
awesome video guys!
💪💪💪
Épico!
Saquen nuevo disco y salgan de gira por el mundo!!!!!!!!!
🔥 its always crazy how political tyrants ruin the lives of many but also give others a voice to band together. SOAD will always be one of the best bands in my opinion . definitely helped shaped my musical taste from early on
It`s like pausing the career track in 2005 and then suddenly pressing play again in 2021. Worth the 15 year wait.
Unexpected and yet greatly appreciated. This rocks !
🔥🔥
Melhor banda de todos os tempos 🇧🇷
SOAD playing Black Metal??? NOICE
is Awassome
no se entiende un choto la letra jajan´t
I didn't believe this when i saw this... Holy shit!!!
Arménie Free

Great song
Stary dobry System🤘🤘🤘🤘
Very amazing for song,I like it 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Bikaina! Atsegin dut, oso, bereziki 1:20 -tik aurrera musikiak hartzen duen abiadura itzela, frenetikoa, oilo-ipurdia jartzekoa. Top notch song, dudes! I like it very much, specially from 1:20 when getting galloping, frenetic full-speed. Bravo!
Наконец-то
SOAD doesn't need to change, SOAD needs you to make a change
rock is coming back🤘❤️
Good old SOAD is back! 🤘
Esto es la ostia
Что то новенькое
Holy Freak these guys still have it. So freaking awesome.
НоваЯ песня? огонь🤘

Beautiful video’  Speechless!  Please covid pass so I can go to a future tour concert 🎵 🙏🏽
Not bad
I thought these guys were lost
System of A Down for ever! Eu amo a system of a down
Songs good but eh...I probably wouldn't listen to it again, never been a huge fan of SOAD anyways
1:21 that is a good black metal riff
bella
БОМБА
Genocide is the most evil thing in the world.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wow!!!! Shocked guys, this is fantastic!!!!!
This sounds like shitty local band circa 2001
E aquela pegada de deathcore tem?
What's the message? :)
You know shit hit the fan in Armenia when Soad writes not one but two songs about it. I did wish for new songs but I hate the circumstances. Your German fans are with you, even if our government isn't.
SYSTEM OF A DOWN ROCKS!!!!!!!!
The video is straight fire. Thank you for the music, it's such a pleasure to hear your new songs again! You're doing a very important and great work! We're entirely with you. And huuge greetings from Russia, we're waiting for you to visit us so so much!
Глядя на них,  даже не верится что прошло столько лет. Такие же мощные как и 15 лет назад!!только стали старее. Вместе вы сильнее !
Black Lives Matter
This is like a dream!! 😭😭
!
such a new song! by the system
🇦🇲ARMENIA🇦🇲
Esto ROCK hecho inspiración del alma. Saludos desde Lima Perú 🙂/
The world needs System
>le ebil azeris
Prob woulda made way more cash if they did an album and donated earnings from one of the songs
So let me get this straight!  If you take money out of the situation so no one in the band gets any!!  The guys will actually make music together like a band? Wow !! I was wondering what it was going to take.  That's a shame when money comes between musicians.  Don't you know music isn't about the $ sign.
New generation of musicians need to learn from this masters. SOAD trademark sounds is still there.
Takes me back to the good days jamming out. Good times, they sound the same as back then...love them and love this song it goes hard. 🖤
C A D A S .. !!
Ну держись, кнопка повтора
Это лучшее начало года!!!
Muy buena rola locos!!
👽👹👻
uffffffffffffffffffff..... hum... overwhelming
Charles Manson com certeza esta aplaudindo voce Daron! kkk
Look man you guys are the best and I’m glad you came together to fight for what’s important to you it’s a great cause so this comment isn’t mean to downplay that at all. With that being said whatever the issue is get over it the world needs soad. If it really is that serj wants to take the band in a different direction why? If it isn’t broke don’t fix it no offense to you serj your awesome and I love your solo stuff but it’s exactly thAt man if you wanna do something different do it on the side man. But don’t give up on soad. Your music got me through so many harsh times mesmerize was the best thing that happened to me in 2005. Keep it up and keep fighting for what you believe what’s happening over their is shitty and I hope you all make a difference.
You always got your back,don't face the fool which tries you to EVIL
system sendo system, depois de anos fazem uma música com melodia de nostalgia... perfeito
There is a galactic space force above your head in massive and overwhelming Force. angels and areals.    they're on hold the angel has its arm up and it's saying hold hold so it can save souls then he's going to say go and I'll be playing this song when it happens you.  the Angels watch what evil is being done to God's Children.  And they were told to hold back. Well they're not going to hold back anymore...  Cleansing of the Earth. No Marilyn Manson no wanna be Anton LaVey no elite , those who start wars those who harm the innocent and weak. The vile evil they do and torture to human life and children has God's wrath furious. And the mockery of God's Messengers. Nothing will be able to save them... not even there underground labyrinths. Not even their below ocean labyrinths. They can only go so far underground. And one worker of the light just one could destroy the entire Earth that's just one. Isaac 777hmz
I have an add-on here trying to give me bipolar depression pills saying I'm bipolar and depressed no my pain IO glands open there's nothing wrong with it I'm not bipolar you're trying to give me an ad to take some drugs so I cannot send my message
Adult swim Hollywood the satanic celebrities the satanic business brokers the satanic leaders who cause death upon innocent children and star seeds of all ages. Your time has come For this is a spiritual battle one that cannot be won with weapons because there are things more advanced than you in this universe. I never run from the devil. I never hide from the devil. I now fight the devil. I love this song so much it gives me strength and that inner power just when I'm getting tired I listen to the song to boost my energy levels back up drink some pure water lemon juice vitamin b3 recharge my pineal gland. Clear my system of food. And fight the devil.
1:30 that death metal as fuck riff the good ole soad i remember
Now we listen the true rock song haha
Vaccine is here. They are back!
Olhas os BRs aqui
New album pls!

Este Video Y ese Sonido estilo Black Es Excelente
Por fin algo nuevo
I've missed SOAD. Can't believe I was a teenager when they were around. Now they are back I'm in 30s. Wild.
1:19 Trve Armenian black metal
Nem vi mais já deixei o não gostei...
Get rid of the drummer so we can get more consistent SOAD tracks. It's obvious he's the hold up over new music because he's a trumptard.
legends
lovely seeing you guys back at it!!
This Masterpiece is wayyyyy to short, please moooore! Damn, this is one of the best stuff i've heard in the last 10 years, wow. For me this is THE comeback of the metal genre. I hope you'll make an album in this style and with that awesome sound.
Fucking beautiful boys, fucking beautiful!!! Thank you! Love you! Long live Artsakh!!
dont eat the fish
Thank you, System Of a Down, your presence in the world of Rock revitalizes my soul again ... I feel the energy flow in me once again !!!
Do I hear fuckin blast beats?!? ❤️🍻
I really love this band but this is trash
I'm a big fan! leave a like there guys! #I am brazil
dope but drop the trump drummer
За Армению!
good to know they're back. the world needs them
1:19
Im all in
Ohhhh damn !!!!  Respected, how they kept maintain their music pattern 🔥🔥🔥 GOLD 🟡🟡🟡
Интересно, а люди вообще в комментариях задумываются о смысле этой песни, интересуются? Песни, которые выпустили SOAD в этом году, были написаны о событиях 2020 и 2021 года на Нагорном Карабахе (Арцах). Я очень рада и горда тем, что люди этой группы, в особенности Серж Танкян, привлекали внимание к этому ужасу, что происходил с Арменией и Арцахом, немало помогали, отправляя средства на нужды. А песни Genocidal humanoids и Protect the land были написаны с целью призвать внимание общественности к тем ужасным, террорестическим и бесчеловечным деяниям многих стран по отношению к Арцаху и Армении.

Love this song happy bday to me 🤘😎🦇😈🔥
Finding out they came back was more exciting than finding out Tool was finally delivering an album (like a year ago, Fear Inoculum). I lost my shit. SOAD is always a fucking treat to listen to.
Thank ur still making music inspite of the garbage overrated trending music today who has million views....
Lyrics :D ?
I really hope they can somehow put together a new album and eventually tour. Imagine all the money they could raise for their cause if that happened.
SOAD is back!!!!!!!!
Yes !
Perdón por motivos de trabajo llegue hasta ahora 💥😁 perdón  por hacer esperar a esta joyita ❤😘

This is so goddamn beautiful, holy shit. The love I have for them is immense 🤟🏼❤️
son tantos los problemas y las diferencias que hay entre cada integrante, que no pueden juntarse de una buena vez y sacar un album? 15 años ya! 15 largos años esperando...
my respect for this band just keep growing. <3 SOAD thank for having and using your spines :)
Соскучился по Армянам))) Рад что вернулись!!!!

You are liars.You and me know the truth that you 30 years ago killed our brothers and sisters.After that during the war you are bombarded our cities that far away from the battlefield.So stop the lying.
System of a down never fails! 🤘🏿

Bro this song shows how much SOAD would still sound good together... I hope they come back with a surprise album !!!!
not ever really liked this band...#mindchanged
👁👃🏻👁
waiiiit... new album out?
Am I the only one that reminds me of another song of SOAD? (in the refren)
Serj reminds me my angry grandma when she doesn't recognize me because of her alzheimer
The principal genocide now is that genocida invented from the corona virus that killed more than 2  million of persons around the world. Greetings from Peru, one of the principal victims of this invented pandemic. Long live Armenia, long live Peru, long live the opressed peoples in the world! SOAD IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD!
This song says it all. Best wishes and support to Armenia from Germany.
Damn, that's all I can say.
SOAD is inspirational
Haven't loss the touch, good stuff
I LOVE that !! Pure SOAD !! Perfect music, video, lyrics and powerful message! 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
It’s gonna be a no for me dawg
100% SOAD
e os Br???
Is there anything that these guys put out that's bad? MTV and all the other makers and breakers of music/musicians should take heed - good non-formulaic audacious music has a BIG audience, and we're loyal to those acts. That makes may of us lifelong "consumers" ...if it helps for you to look at us that way :l
Trash
Aah, that’s gooooood.
I felt like I was back in the early 20's with this song, listen to SOAD in the bus going to school...
I don't understant, I can't donane if i live in russia? What's a fuck?
Toma que toma que toma toma que toma que toma ta.
Finally
AWESOME!!
Oh
system of a down sounds like tenacious d if jack black was into black metal
I'm 21 and i've been listening to SOAD since i was like 5 thanks to my cousin. They were my childhood and adolescence. Now i listen mostly rap music but they are and Will always be mi favorites ever. I'm soooo happy for This song, kisses from italy♥️♥️
setelah 10 tahun lamanya~
100% face melter
omg r they back???!!!! please say yessssss
so they are back? 😃
It looks like The Dictator is now copying system of a down
Boooooom!!!!!
Благодарю, Братья! Добро победит!
Legend dont die  Legend come back when shit every where
this song slaps so fucking hard
Они воссоединились ?
#SOADforever
Ой как ждали то давно! Но мотив на суицид похож, или показалось. Прикольно!
Слава Армении Привет из России Нет геноциду Армян !!!!
❤️
2:21 it’s looks like he’s not even playing what the heck
A perfect SOAD track!
наконец то, блядь! го так дальше
Навели суету
holy shit, this is SOAD!!!
О... Дождался таки я контента :)  Всем расеянам привет :)
thanks to my uncle and cousins ​​for teaching me what good music is
y make me cry
Isn't it ironic how we want everyone who's genocidal to die
Music is back
Love🖤
SOAD is still rockin' hard as they did in the 2000's 💜🤘🏻
Borat in System Of A Down
Anybody else feel like Daron looks like a Deep Roy era Umpa Loompa? Perhaps one that's trying to sell you black market everlasting crack rock...
Ya idk man...uh. it's ok I guess. Let's hear somethin else.
Wait.... SOAD are together again?
Still one of the hokiest and worst rock bands ever. This is fking terrible.
When I met SOAD back in my 12 y.o I felt in love. Now I'm 28 and I'm still here. SOAD 4 ever
Жирно.. очеень..
😲
Когда они вместе это просто огонь!!!! Ждём нового альбома SOAD!!!
Класс, SOAD ни с кем не перепутаешь, не изменяют своему стилю!
........I thought I was supposed to stop being in the mosh pit once i grew up....but then one of the very first reasons i ever joined a mosh pit releases new music 15 years later....
I have a problem with this song             It's too short
10/10 thank god they stopped being pussys and made music again.
Guys you are the band that lead me to listening the metal genre (heavy power black everything). Your music always had various metal and rock elements but also the unique system of a down style of vocals (that also have roots in traditional music genres). What you did with this song is out of this world in all aspects. I cant hold my happiness. thanks for all!
México 🇲🇽
Pretty fucking good
Is this real life?
1:20 Black Metal ?
Plot twist...  ...we are the devil...
Let us unite as one then  Let us learn Allow a united voice  Im but a single voice that I doubt anyone will hear or for that matter care. I'm am your family and friends. I am you.  Displaced without knowing how or  why. Just trying to get by. If reading this you must be me? Find one like minded person and lead them here and say your name. My name is Michael , I am but a single voice. Please help me find away
Idk what comment i have to make So i think this wil do    ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bro stop saying how glad you are for them releasing new music n take it in the message!
Nearly magical how good they sound together. You know, it's not an easy thing when you come back to the studio after 15 years apart and want to make it good again. But then they record it like it was never any of the hiatus or feud inside.
You are Soooo Soad   My fav Rock band ever
Way too short tho! :(
Ta falando do Bolsonaro ne ? kkk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyw5yPSq91w the same?
this is what we've been robbed of for 15 years!! One can only hope these guys realize getting old is a thing and put aside their egos to deliver this amazing music.
Mierda por un momento pense que era Zellen
Woooooooooah!  Didn't expect that blast beat part in the middle of the song.
Esto SI es SOAD! Está chidota. Saludos desde México! 🤘
Postareli parni kone4no...
Fuck, serj still sounds same like old days
I want to donate but it always shows you can't donate to this country or region.  I'm from india🙏
oh how we missed you!!!!!!
Fidel Castro is back!
Joe Biden, back to useless wars. Trump 4 years and 0 wars. Here we go again.
Yo why people are just missing the point of this song? Yeah it's cool SOAD is back...
Amazing song🔥
Serj tankian is looking like Marcos Mion from Brazil xD
Amei
NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT THAT BLAST BEAT???????
remimds me of the older and better stuff from this awesome band!
АААААААААААААА!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!СВЕРШИЛОСЬ!!!!!!!! как же я долго этого ждал!!
Legalzinho
Finally, new song... Can headbanging with my children when we listening together...
Please let this lead to more new material. The world needs SOAD now more than ever.
Fall of an awesome group
I listened to a lot of cringe-ass music in middle and high school, but SOAD is one of the few bands that holds up over time. I love  how the sound evolves and yet the soul of that first album is never lost. Seeing the video for Sugar changed my young life for the better.
Хотел по смотреть старые клипы, а тут новый вышел! Очень удивлëн, ребята молодцы!
This is just spectacular. I can only hope that Armenia prevails in the end and we can hear more from SOAD.
Как в старые добрые времена!
they'll never disappoint me !!! 😍
Hell 2 tha yeah.. Excellent song, video and msg. 2 thumbs and middle fingers up
Awesome the band is back 👌👍from Australia
SOAD IS BACK! AS PUNK. \m/😀
New soad album in the days of the end would be great gift for us and a classic spank to the sistem!!
Awesome!
Idk guys ... I grew up on soad, this song reminds me of good old soad as we know it but something is not right 😔
Voltaramm?????
Bomba!! Ciut za krótki👍🙂
Br this gere 🇧🇷
That blast beat is so refreshing. Cool song
well i love soad but this is not really... dunno. good
so strange to watch a 4k system music
Serj parece o Marcos Mion 🤣🤣🤣
they still killing it
stealing society +  cigaro
То есть никого не смущает,  что группа выпускает первые 2 песни за 20 лет, САМОГО среднего уровня, при том МАКСИМАЛЬНО политически ангажированные. Те же люди, которые пели "Soldier side", теперь призывают идти на баррикады. Это те же люди? Эта та же группа? Никто ничего не замечает , а просто радуется? пздц
Красавцы мужики так держать
Love those blast beats!
I have a feeling they copied rammsteins lighting in this vid...Rammstein used the  same in their 2019 tour for the song Rammstein
Супергуд)
Blast beats in a SOAD song..that's a first
At 1:45, I can hear a faint discord notification sound
Finally... a miracle happened.
S.O.A.D we know exactly what you mean with humanoidz this is a spiritual war we are currently in. Interdimensional to be exact.
Fuck me this is good!!!!
Perfect!!!
This news honestly made my year already,  please tell me theres more...
Gonna say this. Been a 'fan' since 2000ish but can't but feel its become cool to say you like SOAD because even though I appreciate their talent, message and style, I cant help but think that their songs now all sound the same and lose their listenability within 2 or 3 days where as other bands release songs and albums than can easily be played for weeks or months on end and never lose that 'pop' like i'd say they're the most skipped band in all my playlists and its not because i'm not a fan, its just the thought of listening to the song from start to end bores me.  Eitherway i'm glad they're still kickin and still spreading their message to new and old fans, just feel they've past their prime now.
Its a YES from me!
the Blastbeat part
1,525,101 views ,when everyone of this viewers donate $1 ,they gonna have $1,525,101...
that video is amazing.
Какие же они АХУЕННЫЕ!!!!!! Благодарен своему музыкальному вкусу, который выбрал эту группу в далеких 2000-х.
10 years later but here we are like It never pass a day
Mooreee we need mooreee
Ver el video y pensar que su música era escuchada en todas partes aya por la década pasada.. Y ahora verlos regresar... Ufffff lo máximo
Old good SOAD...
Wowwww I,m FC from Thailand. Yak bok va sudyodddd!!
Fucking tingles ❤️🔥👊🏼
Жесть как прёт!!!!!!
Sooo Great ....unreached ....❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
MEU SOAD TA VIVOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  💖😭💖 E o Serj tá um daddy de barba cheia 💖 e tá a cara do Marcos Mion hehe!  Tô todo arrepiado ✨✨✨✨
SOAD,BRAVOOO👏👏👏
Long live armenia
Welcome back to the early 2000
Когда выбрасываешь мусор мимо мусорного бака, где то в мире злится один Серж.
Okay now where is the lyrics guy, i need it while watching this
WOAH NEW MUSIC OK COOL
All my support to Armenian people ! Great song !
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
ONE MORE SOAD ALBUM Do we ask way too much? :/
pain I can't donate in my country
epic!
From Indonesia we always support Armenia and Artsakh. I hope that after the COVID pandemic, SOAD can have a concert in Jakarta
If COVID hysteria hadn’t cone around I woulda seen SOAD 2 more times BY NOW....  1000 things to look forward 2 ....one day.... 👍 for this musical  assault!
YEAAAHHHHHHHH
Спасибо за ваш неоценимый вклад братья!
sooooo fucking Happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tamer Yeşildağ ?
This is my anthem now against the Battle of evil hello star seeds hello Ariel's up above us hello beautiful aliens across the universe coming to our aid just like prophesized. Thank you for choosing communication with me it's an honor and I will never run from the devil I will fight these demons when I heard my daughter crying something snapped in me and I was raging lion. In my star seed shown forth in the blue workers of light surrounded and chased the red away. Now we all must fight the devil people like Marilyn Manson brain warner  who, harms things that are weaker, like women. Adult swim and all those others will be brought down. Those who hurt women and children and animals.
LOVE IT !!!!!!
God save Armenia.
не знаю, на что собирают деньги эти старички, но я уже хочу сделать донат
Serj tankian = the Keanu Reaves of metal
Супер!!!!
can't wait for world war 3 so they can release more songs.
Ого!! Круто!! С возвращением!!!
Damn, Daron didn't go high note on this song 😢
#FreeArmenianPOWs
That is Amazing !🥰😍
.
For three days this video sat on my browser, because I was worried you'd gone soft over the years. 0:11 Nevermind.🤘
Sounds as GOOD as they did 20 years ago!
Not too bad
Yes
Todavia la rompen SOAD thanks😍
Sounds like Cigaro off Mesmerize. Good tune, hope they come with an album.
Hold up! Is this real?!!
SOAD never fell off 🤘🏼
always involve a little boy.
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽💩💩💩
Sorprendido por esa parte Black Metal en el minuto 1:20. Regreso Peculiar.
Came back strong ... hell yeah
Los pvtos amos ufff
Pretty good.
Pensé que nunca mas iban a subir algo nuevo
They're back, they are effin back omg. Effin cryin right now, one of my fave bands is back together. SOAD, how we have missed you \m/ and look, still the same beautiful music that turned my life around for the better \m/
🔥
If we knew we'd need to start a new war to get a song from SOAD we'd send the drones a decade ago.
Once a fan, always a fan. You can’t dislike new music if you were a fan from the start. You have to like their music and there’s no disagreeing 🤣
Man this is a new system. Different than they were back with mesmerize and hypnotize. Back then they seemed almost anti war and now they seem to be fighting in one. I understand why but it's odd hearing them like this. I kinda like it
I'm so happy ❤️ thanks SOAD
We never summon the devil. Based
This actually sound better than the last recording of the same song that was released 2minths ago, IMO.
Prostitutes Who prosecute have failed us from the start?!
1:06 de nada
Man it’s like I’m 13 again. Loved it !
🧡💙❤️
Путлер предал, как и всех, кроме своих
Shavo you fucking genius

Caralho ficou foda
Nice to see System back again !!! Good song !!!

Muitooo abaixo do nível deles essa música sinceramente. ( N é ruim mas tb n é boa )
🇧🇷❤🔥
Holy fuuuck   S O A D  is come back
I just got a super smile on my face
Naw, no way.... A NEW SOAD SONG???? And a fucking good one!!!!! It made my day!!!!!
Thanks, guys, another death in rock. Keep it up, Kurth would appreciate your intentions. However, I hope your president and Biden and many of others are happy now. We raised the problem of whatever we are good.. no matter how many Armenians you just digged in.
HOLY SHIT
Just thank you.
👏👏👏👏
took a war in their country to bring em back together. whatever it takes i guess?
It’s like they never took a break. I get goosebumps from the nostalgic feels from these two songs. We hope there’s more to come, but if not thank you guys. ❤️
https://youtu.be/zkp0ALSfEIY
Just Legends no one can deny it
For God's sake they really don't sound like anything else but themselves, I think it's sign of how greatly fabulous they got
Love SOAD 🖤
🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾
What's wrong Erdogan?
Bem doido
Serj looks like Christopher Lee
The vocal harmonies....... The drums..... The bass..... The guitar......  EPIC SOAD!!!   Edited as I missed out the bass. How could I! Well, I did initially say 'guitars' but some people eh....... lol ;)
アルバム出す日は近いな💓

Дратути
You ever see a 42 year old school teacher head bang?
Dam.......BALLS DEEP!
Sorry, System. No matter how interesting the lyrics are, the music sounds like pretentious garbage :/
*Their home is under attack right now!*
Серж на Жорика Вартанова похож
It’s like they never left 🙏🏽
Boom SOAD! Very cool :D
Breathtaking
Nao sabia que o marcos mion estava no soad
Timetravel is real
Is this mediocre or have I just gotten older
Serj is maddd man!
sad fact: genocide is not real xD
Очень круто! Молодцы! Заждались вас!  Посыл и мотив в видео мощный!
Still got it, as if there was ever any doubt!
Damn boys, i missed you so freaking much!
My new We Are Our Mountains shirt just arrived the other day. This is great guys!
Very impressive.!!!
The paradigm shift I'm trying to bring to light is that you have your natural impulses and you have society itself. It's been covered different angles, but it stems back to how if you want to improve society, tearing it down is not enough. You have to understand what makes different systems work, and understand what needs are to be addressed in order for that social system to evolve. It brings your own power back to yourself, since it forces you to address how you see your own issues are reflected in society/parenthood/social-life or whatever else. Thus changing the world becomes a matter of growing.

1:14 best part
Still on fireeeeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
А в конце Армению показали )))
genial animación !
I would beat the devil I wouldnt run from the devil  I would summon the devil for ALL......MY......SINS!!
One question. Is it only one time comeback for one song?
I comment this video to support Armenian people.
🇦🇲🇦🇷🤘🤘
Wow, I am now ready to finish the workday. Thanks SOAD 👌🏼🔥🔥
Sounds like every track on hypnotize/mezmerize.... Please serj can you go back to being the main singer song writer.... Sack daran and his massive ego 🖕
Lyrics _  Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Persecution ends now Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids Teaching warfare to their children The bastards that will be destroyed Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

Супер
Fucking god damn it, yes!!!
❤️
I want more! 😅😅
Жалко, что мировое сообщество не поддержало армян в Карабахе.
PROTECT THE LAND!!!
The police is the devil.
After much time, a new song. Very good.
Anyone wanna break down what the meaning is?
SOAD was the last thing I expected... And I'm excited
Que saudade que eu tava
How is not illegal to make music this terrible?
Despues de 15 años, que emoción volver a escucharlos 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Is this new ?
Consistency at its Finest!
They still have it
HOLY F*CK !!! this is good old SOAD as I remember them. <3
Круто💪😏
АХУЕННО!!!!
Really fun riffs, and the vocalists have the same amazing chemistry they used to have, but the ending feels abrupt and half-baked. This song could have used a little more time in the oven.
❤💙🧡
я ненавижу политику и меня печалит тот факт,что одну из моих любимых групп заставило объединиться только война.ебаный 2020
Awesome
VOOOUUUUUIIIIIIII !!!!!! System of a Down est de retour !!!!!!!!
Sono Tornati ....e alla Grande   🤘🤘🤘
Eu juro ter visto o Marcos Mion kkkkkkkkkk
This is f*cking amazing!!😭
This song is awesomesauce.
My second home. Iam of Pontiac decent and my wife is Greek - Armenian. Two "on the run" races. So whoever messes with Armenia messes with me as well. 🇬🇷🇦🇲
We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil Resposta a sociedade que criminaliza o Rock Satânico,em quanto eles mesmo provam q o Cristianismo é desordeiro e destruidor.Amei😎😎😎👏🤘🤘

1:20 System Of Black Metal
Theory: The kid in this video is the same kid from the beginning of the Question video
F
We all miss u its ashame we will never see a new album but this is pure
The one thing that i can say - You are Genius🤘
Most bands had changed style but that's okay❤ cause some bands didn't, like SOAD❤ (i'm not saying that changing styles is a bad thing, but staying with their styles is just so nostalgic WAHH❤)
Doctor : "you only have 1 minutes left" Me : "play the newest SOAD song" Doctor : "but it's 2 minutes" Grim Reaper : "it's fine, just give it to him"
looks like boomer garbage is back on the menu
Reminiscing my early teen years hearing this, classic SOAD!
1:20 TRVE SOAD KVLT
👆🏻
круто,стоп геноцид
El púrpura ganará siempre en la oscuridad es sinónimo de luz espiritual, futuro despertar global.
🇲🇾🔥🤘
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
สุดยอด!!!!!!
наконец тоооооооо!!!!!!!!!
So glad they didn’t change the sound to a more corny modern alternative rock sound and kept it classic with its roots of the late 90s
Top
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻❤️🤘🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😎😎⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Крутое видео, получше чем сольный проект Сержа с плоской Сашей Бортич
Serj: 😡 Daron: 😳 Shavo: 😕 John: 😐
This is epic.
They aren't "genocidal humanoids". They're human beings just like everybody else. Demonizing others won't lead to any lasting solution.
Black metal????
Absolute beauty
por individual una caga, pero unidos hp arrecho!
Manooooo do céu, muito bom.
Need You for psycho terapeut?
Simplesmente sensacional!   por favor, façam um novo album.
Нихера себе!👍

Спасибо! кайфанул! Как же вас не хватает парни. Очень жду новый альбом. Старые уже все наизусть.
Pensé que ZellenDust estaba en la miniatura jajaja
I can't stand SOAD's old stuff now, way overplayed it in my edgy teenager years and personally a bit deranged by bands making political statements but the new sound is dope as hell. Wonder if it has sticking power.
I am fucking hypnotised by their faces.
“I did my waiting! 13 years of it!”
For a moment I thought it was Borat on vocals lmao
Me dejó con sabor a poco
God I never thought I'd see them together again. Such a powerful song.
O Marcos Mion ta de vocalista agora?
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Yeah I needed this 🥔
So fcking good
Очередь в американской больнице с белорусской актрисой.Хм. Дёшево
I just wish he would scream like he used to. Saw them right after Toxicity dropped at Ozzfest in 2002 his screams were so dope.
anyone know what bass shavo is using in this video???
The Z in humanoidZ reminds me of the way Gorillaz use to name things.
Այս թախծոտ ու գեղեցիկ հայկական աչքերը....Այս խելահեղության հասնող էներգետիկան,այս զգայական երգեցողությունը... Բռավո, Կեցցեք տղաներ!
Кинење 🇲🇰 БРАВО 🤘🤘💯💯
А бабки на что собирают?
Voltaram?
Тема. Языка не знаю, но мурашки по коже. Бомба!
Já começou amassando, isso é rock um roll🤘🏼❤🔥
I'm really glad too see them together again🥰
JESUS THIS SONG FUCKING SLAPS!!!!
Finally i can sleep with smile
#Back system of down
I enjoy this song but the shakey camera and how the video is edited give me a headache.
Теперь осталось их из России вывезти и будет хорошо.
Che tristezza. 3 riff di chitarra buttati li.  Non riesco ad ascoltarvi più
BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's like they haven't been anywhere! As good as ever. I think we all needed this.
Just amazing, the music is superb the lyrics send a powerful message and you know its SOAD just as you hear them! 10/10
we need more screams and growls for it to truly be a return for system but this is a great reunion nonetheless, hope we can get an album some day in the future
The spiritual words are breathtaking I love star seeds you know system of a down are definitely a star seed band you know they're angelic and I see the Aerials too. we have the most powerful processor in the world in the enemy does not want us to use it a calcify it your pineal gland needs to be free and yes we do fight the devil. I'm speechless how beautiful the song is.
Serj is the big genius
Ah so damgood
Holy shit that black metal blast beats riff
whining is a lifestyle for these guys lmfao
sure, sure
That cool☠🤟💥
You just have the calm animation going on and then there’s just system of a down in the background running on straight adderall
Soad after soo long i’m crying.
Whose Karabakh?
Daron!

this is fantastic..
That was INSANE and powerful. They're unique as always, Respect and Love from Finland❤
Am I the only one who likes 'Genocidal Humanoidz' much more than 'ProtectTheLand'?
legende
THIS IS CORONA VACCINE!
Very traditional System of a Down. So glad to see them in this tumultuous time.
"We never summon the table" is all i hear..
Still crushing it. I'd love to hear a new album.
Saw them live in 2006 Ozzfest when I was sixteen years old.
Thanks !
Karabakh  is ours!! Hot under the collar :D
Fuck yeah
Finally back again
I spent so many years slowly transitioning to the sad thought that soad was gone for ever. Then BAM, Thank you Soad. Best thing to happen since.  .  .well.  . Shit I can't even remember the last good thing.
What a comeback 🥺🥵❤️
Is it true that the Republic of Artsakh is *not* officially recognized by Armenia?  And if so: *why?*  Don't get me wrong, I'm really trying to understand what all this is about, but I kind of ...cannot.
All the good vibes for armenia, stay strong
Todos necesitabamos esto.
Wow impressive 👏
The LEGEND is back  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧
Все буде добре!!!
Nepal ♥️♥️♥️
What a great way to start the day. Beatiful and raw, like the reality it is representing. Unity ✊
I’m seriously too happy you’re all back together
Please come to malaysia 😔
You, me, us, them  Pinchi pendejou We never runin pendejou We never summoned pendejou We never hide from pendejou We never  Alguien más la escuchó así la primera vez? xD 🤟🏻😬

I mean, this is them as they are today in this video. Are they going to get back together??? Everyone has been pleading for this for years, myself included!
Meaningful as always!
Шикарно! Как всегда конечно
Wack
blast beats at their age deserves a like
Serj!!!!!!!
SO great to hear them again even if its not album related. Its like they never had time off!
enserio???? :O WTF
Блин,обожаю ,,систему....,, . Хоть мне и за полтинник.

Serj voice is not back yet
I wonder how many people this music video gave seizures

Seizure time!
0:10 Give me fuel,give me fire,give me that wich i desiree uuuuhhh
Yessss 💣💣💣

Nice song!!
Serj looking like Agent Simmons in his last role in Transformers.
Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop!   The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start!
That middle section is full-on black metal. Awesome song!
pen e
The Brazil love This song 🤟
This video currently has Leetsst views
IMAGINE IF 2020 WASN'T SUCH A SHITTY YEAR.....WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE RETURN OF:  SOAD & RATM 👀👀
ta sea, la partieron otras vez !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is embarrassing. Just a shell of their former selves.
Mano olha o Marcos Mion
Caraio é música nova ?
*SERJ, POR TU CULPA NO HAY ÁLBUM NUEVO!!!!!!*
I've heard no words. Thumbs up!!!

*Um dos ultimos fãs brasileiros do brasil*
1:28 Did they include a black metal part XDD
El regresó de unas leyendas 😝😝
sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive been waiting a long time for this
Interesante
Here is your problem. Most SOAD fans don't care about your actual message...We like good music. Make good music...Make us tik
If she doesn’t remember them saying they’d never get back together then she’s too young for you bro.
I love it it kind of reminds me of Old School system of a down. They're coming back! I missed you guys XOXO
Wait. What the fuck is this? ❤
Omg i was waiting for thia so much
Is Malakian a real Albanian last name? I am familiar with the Greek term...literally constantly during the COVID-19 isolation.
Let me tell you something! Ive got to say that SOAD is one of not so many bands who stay true to they’re roots but also sounding new. We need SOAD to come tightest for the people and do albums and tour. So much Shit going on in this planet, I think the only ones who could do it just is is SOAD and again not so many bands!!!!!
Best SOAD song ever yo! Welcome back yo!🤘😎🤘🌷🖤❇🎤📣🎧🥁🎹🎸🎼🌌😊🎂
They still got it!!!
That was amazing
Please put out an album already..... .
Oh shiiiiittttt
МОЩНО!!!!
Me encantaa
Accurate! ❤️✝️
thank you SOAD
1:20 - not bad for non-black metal band.
Faith in rock restored
Serj está parecendo o apresentador de TV Marcos Mion!
SOAD, a banda que chuta a bunda dos roqueiros reaça kkkkkkkk
Uma nova BYOB? Hahaha
the guitar player needs to shut up and play guitar. soad was better before they let the little puke open his mouth.
I wasn't enjoying it at the start, then i heard that riff, just wow
*RETURN OF THE KING*
Anyone noticed the blast???
The true SOAD sound! 🫀
FINALLY!!!! THIS IS EPIC!
الله يرحم صدام
How is this not front line news
Yes sir  that's what I've been waiting for thanks guys great music once again.
This is great
Clip fodaaaaaa 💪💪💪👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
MÁSTERS! 🤘🏻🖤
x 1,5 do. think that is better
Hell yeah
Its this fuking real? hell yeah I miss this music style soo much
Yes!!!  System of a Down is back baby!  Drink it in mannnnnnnmn!
Here before another 10 mil!!!
Ахринеть!
Thank you 🙏🙏 for this 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
...не зацепило😷
🤘😎
Maaaaaaaaan!!!!!
heavy, fast, ANGRY...
❤️✌🏼
Legend is back 🤘
Terrorists sing about terrorism
Nice finally!
Serj looks like judd hirsch on crystal meth. And I love it
Why can't they just make a 10 song album? 5 songs with what Daron wants and 5 with what Serj wants
Their style didn't change since 2005, stupidly primitive music, vocals became worse.
1:20 So TRVE
It sucks that they won’t release anymore new music anytime soon. And Serj needs to just play heavy music and get over it! This song is badass.
Excelente!!!
Vai te tomar no cuu
You guys even evolved your sound some and got real heavy, while staying true to the sound we want. Thank you, SOAD!!
Great job coming together and making this song!
Excelente!!
Great song in the worst circumstances
S.O.A.D balik deui euy . hade mang gaskeun...
A mesma indentidade musical... é de mais. Essa banda nunca devia parar.
Legend
Por alguna razón me da nostalgia
systen me la pela
Okay next up: MUDVAYNE
This was a breath of fresh air and they haven't lost their edge!
Я знал что это случится 😏
SOAD eh PHODA!
Didnt see that blast beat part coming! Sick
SOAD ❤️!!!!
Just a question How can you dislike this?  Even if you don't like this is to help
Bring back backstreet boys 👊
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Uma das melhores bandas de New metal de todos os tempos.
🇲🇽🔥🇲🇽
THANK YOU SYSTEM!!!!!! There is not ONE SOAD fan out there that isnt happy about this!!!!
Great song! Glad to hear this 😎
Crazy how a 53-year-old mans and 3 dudes in their 40’s have been in “hiatus” for nearly 15 years and still sound like they did in their 30’s.
Oh my!! My fav childhood band is back, WEWT! \m/ ROCK'IN A$$
like many, i have listened to this band since my high school days. i can't put into words how confused i am how this band, and all that it stands for, can find excuses for a trump voter in their midst. to me, sadly that's unacceptable, and while i respect that they can still come together to fight for a specific cause, i can't find it in my heart to listen to them ever again...
my respect to them is inmesurable right now
It would have been great if you did this ten years ago..
i always love how powerful SOAD's messages are and how hard they deliver them. The best part is they never lose who they are no matter what they go through. \m/ <3
It's perfect this song
Sick as ever 🤘🏻. Should come with a warning for epileptic people though...
This needs more views
Poland with Armenia! Have a nice day to all
What a waste of electricity, iron, copper, plastic and so on.... From beginning to 2021 evolution is 0.
I missed them so much
Зачем вы их разбудили?
My favourite off the two songs you guys made. 🤟🏻
❤💙🧡❤💙🧡❤💙🧡 2020/1915 🙏🏼 thank you for this as Armenians heal we appreciate all of you  Kalaydjian family USA Florida 👩‍👧😪✊
Definitely missed SOAD
Круто! 10 эпилептических припадков из 10!
Commercial...
Cant be real... SOAD with new song
As a kurd we will support Armenian People because we have same enemies
YYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At last!!!!
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
Wow!!!! Love you guys!!!!
Жаль песенками войну в Карабахе не закончить.
I remember over 20 years ago when you guys came together and blew my mind. And then come out with this and blew it again.  I like the music you have been putting out separately but you guys are better together by far.
These losers are back now is it?
Please, just give us a new album
20 años escuchando esta banda, nunca entiendo que dicen algo sobre pokemon y pikachu. Mucho ruido y un judío armenio comunista diciendo ahhh ahhh igual tienen canciones pegadizas
MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL TIMES ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love the blast beat portion..... great song!!!
What a performance
Mantienen su esencia!
sic
The best in this is Warwick bass
No puedo dejar de escucharlo... ❤
Man. These guys are so fucking cool.
Welcome back ...
BRUTAL!!!
I loved their performance on this song congratulations
meh
As thankful as I am to have lived to see SOAD release new music. We need more..
I was wondering when they would say something about the new Armenian genocide going on .
OMG i love it!
Welcome back
SOAD’s return makes me feel like 12 years again when I used to listen all of their albums unrepeatedly.
şerefsiz biri geldi aklıma dinleyince
Daron, please don't leave the Ibanez!
Наконец то что то выпустили ... Наверное деньги закончились)))
This Animation is pure Fire!!! SOAD FOREVER!
WAU
At some point I thought I forgot to turn off 2x speed in settings 😆
Over rated. Like these cats. But fucking over rated. .
Black metal riffs and blast beat!
Спасибо
the perfect group doesn't ex.... SAOD: hold our beer
Glad you guys are back. oh by the way serj you look good grey >
God fucking damn! Like a meteor impacting into earth!!!
Yoır song and its video sucks big time.
crlh, é o Marcos Mion
Fresh guys
Daron trying to take protagonism as always. They are better when they are alone with their solo carriers.
Sounds like the drugs r bk in effect
Grande Marcos Mion arrasou no vocal 😎
It's the perfect time for a comeback. I miss System of a Down, I had listened to them a lot in my college years. Always right on point when it comes to their words.
how did i miss a new soad song!?!?
Still The Best Band Ever. More than half my life. Ever since Live show at age 16 I never went back . .  Thank you for the confirmation as to one of the biggest reasons I love SOAD most!
Ок
THEY ARE BACK!!!!!
zajebisty kawałek
Oxeeeee
Waited for these day for 10years.. finally my fav band made a song
Armenia <3
My high school soul is comeback
I think,this is one of less SOAD-songs where John uses blast beat...GOOD JOB SOAD!!
I dont know of anyone else has noticed this in the video serj is never shown with another member of the band did he even shoot this with them or did he do his takes after they were done
Grüße an Martin Sonneborn

Nooooossa muito foda slc
New SoaD! Man, it’s been a minute.
I have been a huge fan since back in 99 you had that album with "War" and "sweet pea". Love everything you guys do and it's great to see some new stuff. Can we get a covid version of war with a bunch of videos of dick cheney 🤣
These gents have aged gracefully I see. Still definitely that SOAD sound but this songs got some menace to it. Nice. This takes me back to my teens..
Marcos Mion?! 👀
No lo buscaba ni lo esperaba, pero lo necesitaba. Gracias, SOAD!
We waited 16 years for this?! Lame. Go back to your solo projects, please.
El socialismo no funciona
Эпилептики вышли из чата! epileptic left the chat!
SOAD is BACK!!!!
Anality
Now we a song about Xinjiang
Ниче не понял но очень интересно
Welcome back
де бас?!
The boys are back!
This song is 100% SOAD. It feels like they never stopped playing together. And great video by the way with an important message.
good person bad person
It's time to take down the system \m/
I love SOAD but didn't they learn not to let Darron sing after Hypnotize?
YEEEEEEEEEEEE
Recaudar fondos para que?
Awesome. Wish Daron would take more of a back seat vocally. Compliment Serj instead of sharing the vocals as a co-lead singer like the debut album. Just my opinion.
The moment we've all been waiting for people
God bless Armenia and it's people.
Ok but they’re only here because of genocide in their home country that never stopped, they’re not here for music, otherwise they always would have been all those years.     Someone needs to do something about it...... ???
QUE PERFEIÇÃO MEU DEUS, QUE ISSSOOOOO? ?? AAAAAA♡
чё за Х.... Я ??))) и это систем ??...
There is a reason this band has lost all relevancy, you attack azerbajian, steal its land, kill innocents and then play the victim
Immensi ❤️
Thank God there back!
Never thought this day would come!!!! So happy they're making new songs!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
💧👁💧I LOVE THIS
the lamest comeback from my favorite band ever...it's not the same my bros, the 2000s are way gone
They're back
blast beat!
I’ve always hated this band
Pensé que moriría antes de verlos tocar en un videoclip de SOAD, me han dado la esperanza de seguir vivo
They certainly haven't improved with age.
A professionally recorded System song? is this a dream? xd
now these one sounds more on old SOAD , than preview one....
I can't hear the lyrics and while some may enjoy that search you are already subliminal with meaning, now digging through audio to find words. Look I just want to consume a message here, not do a 12 page review without provocation on why does SOAD, I was happy in the past that simply SOAD. Is this getting old? Am I old? Or maybe did soad lose relevance to my lifestyle. Only a downed system will tell.
Woow..  Amaz Guyzzz!!!    YOU Are BaCK! ??? !!!
FELLATIO
Perfect song for the war in Colombia
Good job
I have dreamed of this day since I was a young lad.
Whoaaaa!
Feel old yet ?
Ска, годы берут свое, Серж как и другие участники уже постаревшие, эх...
It's weird seeing SOAD in HD
Damn, every time I hear these guys the more I dig it.....
OMG! They back!!!!!!!
No love for africa ?
At least to me, this was the better song of the 2. Nice that it finally has a real video to go with it. Still rocks and makes me hope for a new album .... there's always hope right?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Отцы вернулись!!!!
We've been waiting for this👌
I FEEL A BREAST OF FRESH AIR, WAS THE ONLY ONE?
Would like to hear this song with younger Serj voice, energy and anger
Sounds like the power rangers going to kicking rita's ass. SOAD <3

Rock isn't dead yet. ❤️❤️
какие же они охуенные
Парни, вы лучшие🤘🤠🇺🇦
SOAD is coming back !!!!!!!! Whoah awesome
Очередной Клипп СОАД посвящённый героической работе Российских силовиков и блестящей внешней политики. Россия несет мир и бережет жизни каждого, невзирая на этническую принадлежность.  Пока ребята собрались, протрезвели, написали песни и смонтировали клипы - Русские Миротворцы, на местности,  развернули свои базы, остановили стрельбу непримиримых сторон . Вновь сотворив Мир и дали возможность людям вернуться в свои дома. И огромное кол-во уже вернулись!!   Но песню про это вряд ли мы услышим от СОАД = )
ALIG ANYIIING
Biden is gearing up to destroy Iran now... Y'all better get to work on writing a song condemning that shit.  I mean you wanna be consistent right? Or maybe write a song about how the last President didn't start one single new war while the guy before him started 5. That should keep ya busy for a while.
Como sempre lutando contra o sistema opressor .yes i  can
Booyaahh🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
To toda arrepiada 🤘 amém

Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

Не помогла армянам эта песенка😂

I'm on fire from your energy, guys! 🤘
They are arabs and they are alkin about genocide. How ironical!
Glad this is here. Very glad I've been a fan for 20 year's.  Song is impressive and after so many years. Check out the fundraiser for this song. I recommend a band to anyone interested 3TEETH

Death Stranding?
Серж ахпер джан красавчик

The sound of L.A 2021
If an album comes out, it will be Legendary !!
Много силно!
The only good system is SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!
Still enough heavy!🤘
Solidarity.
Milliyetçilik kasmayı bırakıp tarafsız şarkılar yapsanız fena şarkı olmamış ama
Barev from Armenia, շատ շնորհակալ եմ ձեր աշխատանքի համար!
The guy looks like an umpalumpa from charlie and the chocolate factory 😂😂
... and of course Daron opens his mouth first.   Dude is incapable of staying off the mic and people wonder why these dudes disagree.
What a surprise from SOAD
System Of A Down never let me down, that's why and for many other things that are my favorite band! Total respect and admiration for the letter's message.
The only issue is that it needs to be longer
SICK AF
классно, в моей стране нельзя сделать пожертвование, здорово,прекрасно просто. спасибо огромное.
ab terörist olduk işte
😱😱😱😱😱
Thank you
Absolutley awsome Guys, great to see you back together!!!

Meu Deus do céu novo hino minha primeira camiseta de banda foi do soad e tenho ela até hoje em dia 🔥🔥🔥 nostalgia pura que delícia ver músicas novas e ainda por cima um foda!! 🙏
SOAD жив! Русские и армяне братья навек. Для русскоязычной аудитории что будет смотреть это видео - фиолетовая незабудка символика памяти геноцида армянского народа.
Fuck yeah!!!!
oh god, how I love this group, through the years, my love is no less....
Сборище наркоманов.
Propaganda
Just amazing!

I fucking missed you guys so much, please don't go away again.
...aaand they're back.
Omg SOAD!!!!! TAKE MY LIFE, TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT! LOVE U❤️
It's so fucking dope seeing a music video of all of them playing again.
What?! Pensé que me Alcatel se había estropeado y cargué de nuevo la página :')
I MISS THEM!!
Finally some good music
This video reminds me alot of the video for l'enfer des dieux by mass hysteria
It seems to me that Serj has a cry from the heart
💪💪💪🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Never liked Darons voice . I can do with out .
This is fkng awesuum. Genocidal Humanoidz indeed, aptly titled for these times.
Brutal
wow....not bad
Wtf? 5 m.subs and just 1m views in 5 days?
Please back!
Aren't we approaching Toxicity's 20th anniversary?! Wtf! Seems like yesterday that album came out, and at such a crazy peroid in history.
<3 ARMENIA
1:10 DALEEEEEE
🤘🏻
clicked up before hearing, my Trust was earned a long time ago.
i’ve never listened to a song so many times when it came out
This is System of a down 100%
I close my eyes..i hear scars on broadway I open my eyes..soad on 🔥🔥🔥
Omg my neck

'This world issue is going to make us relevant again!'
Engraçado que no continente americano, não teve flores.... Mais alguém notou?
โครตมัน ตำนาน🇹🇭
Very very very very very Nice...... .......Fucking Good 🍁🍁😘😘💘💘
🔥👌
Подарок судьбы❤
Ahaha the land that you invaded years ago which is not recognized at all by UN or every other entities. When the war came to get it back, your soldiers ran away like cowards and your president had to scream for truce lol
I bet they will make a new album
I hope the differences between them  both had settled for greater good.
Tengo sentimientos encontrados con este regreso a medias. 😭😭😭😭
El clip es hermoso 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 no han perdido el toque, me encanta su música
New favorite for sure
It hurts me to see Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian so old but hey, nothing is forever :( we just have to listen to their music
Cool😱🤗Im so glad to knw SOAD is back again😍and with a Gret song! Thanks
There's more persecution going on in the world than just Armenia even though that is s bigger more substantial one that people should donate to.  Prwsecution is going on under our noses we don't even know.
🔥
AMÉM!!!!!!!
Subanleeeeee 🤘🏽
Ya están viejitos 😭😭😭
Hope that you are back not for two songs. Really missed you.
😈😈😈
CARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALHO
1:01 it's sound so much like scarlxrd !
It's like they were never gone, FUCK YEAH!!!
Coco versión trucha xdxdxd
Toma que toma que toma que toma ta No se porque me recordó eso jeje

Sabia que Voltariam Fuck the sistem
Damn! Ok you guys just made my day  Soad for life
Sis

Nice but There are not évolution Music of thé band
It's nice that they're back in action together again
Meeu coraaaçãooooooo não aguentaaa, alguém me beliscaaa?😍
Nice.
The Drummer is a total boss, and a true patriot and free thinker
This Is Going to be Extreme Hell Yeah 🤘
i stand by my principle that everything is better with blast beats and breakdowns
Make.A.Fucking.Album.
cringe city
ill take my jaded political views shaken not shoved in my face with this cringe
System is lame.    But that little guitar  player is a real life twat
To bad I never open my mouth. Soooo I have all the power I still can't grow a full crew
Ain't evil to see your reflection in the world nevermind the water
Means he never hated you, forgot to have audience and might see you fine on your own , back to tearing out my opposition I've proven this through my block. Back to how the dark was meant to control all.
welcome back
The only bad thing about this song is its duration: only 2 min?
<3
Esperei tantos anos por esse retorno!!
Buen sonido, muy buena energía, sin duda buena rola 😎🤘🏽
Unpopular opinion - Darron should just stick with guitars. He's a superior player but his vocals are horrendous.
La voz de estos dos siempre será un deleite escucharlo
I was here, wondering how i in all these years had miss this pearl, then realising it was release 4 days ago xDD
yesssssssssssssssssssss, Eles voltaram <3 !!!!
meh. just have to say like it could of been better if they worked together 10 years ago...
הפתק העברי שחיפשת, אח
2021 is already winning.
Se você fechar seus olhos e ouvir, sentirá que está revivendo os alguns antigos...  Thanks SOAD  🇧🇷
👌🏼🤘🏼 Can NEVER get enough of SOAD...!!! 🤪👌🏼😬🙌🏼🤘🏼
I love it
those eyes
Please put your intraband issues behind you and please put out a full new record!
Come to Brazil please 😍😍🇧🇷
😈
DUKRALHO
Duuude the heavier elements in this caught me off guard, wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did but it's sick
It's happening, boys
✊✊✊🔥
Love to Armenia from USA 🇦🇲❤🇺🇲
Wow this is amazing!!!
F YA SYSTEM!!!!!
Más de lo mismo 💩

You niggas literally work against  against anything trying to maintain itself. Even if it is not of sentient human origin in thought
Pecahhhhhh ..!!!!
What about genocidal gods like say the Christian one, so much evil done by one god
Simplesmente fodaaaaa ,tudo que eu queria era um álbum novo😪
John Dolmayan: great musician and awful human being

Really love (and am surprised) by the blast beat but too short and daron sings... :(
These are the same guys who cry when angels have to die?      Edit: it was half satirical and half serious. I was saying this because they look fucking different man
Serj Takian parece o Marcos Mion kkkk🇧🇷
S.O.A.D.is back....!!!!
Oh fuck yes 2021 is better than 2021
Jeez at the 14 second mark for a second there I thought Kane from C&C had joined the band lol! https://youtu.be/9VvmixeowNI?t=14
A very beautiful and powerful music video to go along with an equally amazing song. Everyone who was part of this production did a fantastic job!
Dude. i was just casually scrolling through my feed and THIS POPS UP? ? ? ? FUUUUCK.
просто лучшие!!
Siiii
Muito foda alek bora dancarrrrrrrrrrr
Damn this goes so stupid heavy

Serei eternamente fã
Can we just put this song for AOT Final Season?!?!?!?  It's Related
Mfn brilliant. Talk about the struggle. Tearing your country and life apart. Did I say brilliant? Yes you did.

Didn’t even make over 300,000 dollars through the campaign for relief. Yet we have people like Elon Musk that have nearly 200 billion dollars at any given moment. Pretty sickening ain’t it? But us as Americans think people of government assistance are the problem.
I've watched it 10 times already, loved it. Thanks for the return, the world needs you!
Another lyric to Jon not get it, and the regular fan be amused about how SOAD is political!
Brasil em peso né caralho

Listening to System of a Down brings back memories of listening to System of a Down. 🤘🏾
Just as good as always but what's with the filter on serj !? Haha he sounds like a Darlik from Dr.Who hahah
this system of a down band sounds cool, bright future for those youngsters
The most badass video ever!
Artsakh - is Armenia!!! Karabakh - it's Artsakh!!!
Banda do caralho!!!
Banging Breakdown!  And remember :  The Devil is in the details - Saigon Kick 1995 styling.  Crab Claw Dave approves this song!
Toma que toma que toma Toma que toma que toma TÁ
System Of A Down always heavy
MORE SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!!
After all these years they still treat us with insanely perfect music !! One of the greatest bands of all time hands down!!
We have to protect this band no matter what happend
son la mera ley,
A muito tempo esperando o retorno desses caras
I like it 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Put your differences aside and make good music
Hell yeah! SOAD are back! With love and respect from Russia!
Jesus Christ is the only way and the Bible talks all the truth, get saved or go to Hell and then into the Lake of Fire forever !!!
Jesus Christ is the only way and the Bible talks all the truth, get saved or go to Hell and then into the Lake of Fire forever !!!
Wait...did that just happen?
yeaaaaa
Weird I fell out of music when all these great bands started breaking up. I been getting back into music since these great bands started up again. I'm loving it. It's almost like my teen years again without the crowd surfing.
What The Fuck !!!!!!!!!! Blast beats!!!!! Fuck, my respects. What a fucking song!!!!!!
Best Live band and it's not even close
DONOS DO MEU CU
System of a down lml forever lml
Los amo
Come on guys, we were missing you. Release a new album🥺❤️
Yo there back let's go!!!!!!
Please, please stay together guys. The people of Armenia need the world and the metal communities help but the world and the metal community needs another SYOD album. Make it a fundraiser to we will all buy that shit like its prime day.
🙊
Holy hell in my top 5 favourite bands and that's the way it's always gonna be
Holly fuck man...gives me the chills every time I listen to this. Just incredible how they sound the same as they did back in the glory days. Just insane.
Esto triplicó mis niveles sericos de testosterona.
це так огидно, коли вірмени (один з найдавніших етносів!) пляшуть під сатанинську кремлівську дудку...
I love it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
So glad to see that System Of A Down never lost their touch like alot of other bands have
Feels like the missing portions of B.Y.O.B  .. Agree or Disagree?
Holy FUCK that was brutal.
FORA BOLSONARO VERME TRAIDOR DA NAÇÃO BRASILEIRA
Espere y espere, ahora han vuelto y soy feliz ❤️🤩
Como cuando ya no esperas nada de la vida y llega SOAD con un nuevo video musical! ♡
SOAD forever...Brazil in tha house
Absolutely brilliant. I'm getting back to listening to music again, it helps through lockdown.
makes me so happy to see them together back on their bullshit! sounds great
Being a fan, I’m happy to hear that you guys can still write songs that sound fresh, timeless and uniquely you! Kick a$$ tune!!
There’s something about the way Serj and Daron’s voices fit together that I’ve always loved since Toxicity when Daron started singing more. No matter how much I appreciate all their solo projects it’s something that was always missing to me.
🇵🇹🤟
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
foda pa caraí
El comentario mexicano que buscas crack.
ни чо се как круто удивило просто топово!
1:20 SYSTEM OF A KVLT 🖤🤘 Black Metal vibes 🏴
Até que enfim alguma banda valorizando o Joãozinho no clipe.
Bem legal ver o SOAD de volta. Essas flores roxas lembraram os triângulos roxos que identificava alguns cristãos nós campos de concentração alemães, que parecido com o vídeo, venceram o mal a eles afligido.
I fucking miss you guys!!!!!
💥
System of a down Never died
At least I haven't seen "Can't wait for a new album!" comments.  They're not making a new album.  They just did two songs:  this one and Protect the Land.  I doubt they'd get along long enough to make another album lol.
Wow, tan poderosos como siempre, grande SOAD!!🇲🇽🇲🇽
Armenia!!!!!!
This should have epilepsy disclaimer
Algum BR aí? S.O.D é top das galaxias. Marcou minha adolescência.
Defending our country from terrorist with in our own walls. They will brain wash our children to join the military. So they can use them to murder their own.
BUENARDOOO me encanto :'D
Chaleee ya están todos rucos
Al finnnn...
Mentada de madre 🖤🖤
o humanoide genocida é o presidente do Brasil
Wey. :,)
Dope song. A little too repetitive with the lyrics but nice to see these guys back in action.
Oh my god, that's fcking awesome Stuff like this makes me believe metal is still alive

please do  raise money songs  all year
MARAVILINDO!!!!
I would like more serj less daron... Sorry, just being honest
where were all the wokies when this happened last year? a yes the new generation of Champagne Socialist's doesn't give a fuck in regards of the oppressed (Armenia or the Uyghurs/Tibet) and is in bed with the wealthy and powerful (the establishment, the Media, China or Silicon valley)
Pq eu tô feliz em ver esses caras na ativa, curti aí quem gostou!
👍
mal soad salak soad
The thing about a band that pumps out music everyear or two manage to lose sight of the band ... System knows that and decided to be patient and grow ... This allowed their music to grow and not suffer ... Thank you SOAD !!!

Wenardo pedazo de temaaaaaaaa conxetumareeeee
It's so amazing how they can still make music with their style and still being able to make good music in this time.   A lot of people would've taken a different approach or style, but they stayed the same and it bangs!!! lml
I never thought I’d get to see the day where we got to see them come back together...2021 is already awesome. 🔥🔥🔥
It’s too short! Why?!  awesome song, though.
💪💪✌👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Да ладно, они же распались давным давно, неожиданно
I love SOAD  But the truth is simply  Azərbaycan recovers lands that stolen from the Armenian occupiers .
System of a Down showing to the world who are the real terrorists.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

как будто вернулся 20 лет назад )
The world loves you SOAD! Keep up the good work
Love you, heroes of my musical spirit
Marcos mion tankian 🇧🇷🤣🤣🤣
They sound like this 2000's libanese armenian band, can't remember the name.
1.6k devils
Make the album. Now.
Real cool
Genial🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
OMG I had this video on 1.75x and thought: daaamn, listen to that fast rap! woooa! 😅
Давайте все дружно попросим их спеть на армянском, такого рода песню
They're back !!! 😃☝️🖤🤯🤘
Killer!!
Отличная форма протеста - песни. Лучше, только запускать бумажные самолеты из окон. Молодцы!!!
Cuantos argentinos oyen S.O.A.D.?? 🇦🇷
Heaviest song ever by you guys. Love it. And thank you for raising awareness on the atrocities going on in Armenia.
Esta muy vergas!! 🎶👌🏼🤘🏼

AAAASSH POR DIOS AL FIN JUNTOS DE NUEVOO
1:20 blast beat black metal fudido
Спасибо за тот посыл, что вы несёте в своём творчестве.!   С любовью из России.
AMIGOOO VENGAN A UN CONCIERTO EN ARGENTINA LOCOOO🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Helllll yeaaah ! 👊..The angry effigy of Serj is back !...I love that blackened passage in this sing...Whoaaa !
System Of a Down  ❤️🤘🏻❤️
Daron, or the band in general, never struck me as a gun guy. What’s up with the FNH shirt?  LOL
We love SOAD...from 🇲🇾
yes finally
Serj is Rick Grimes in this clip.
Soad good Toxicity my youth Steal this album good mesmerize great Hypnotize ok  They've lost that it factor
I love when Borat reunite his old band that we all missed
կյանքի կտորներ։
Simplemente cuál sea el propósito de volverse a juntar,escucharlos es una experiencia maravillosa trae a la mente y conciencia la potencia que tenían cuando los conocí.
Աստված օրհնի հայաստանը
I’m really praying we’ll get more System of a Down. A whole album where 100% of proceeds go to this charity, would be even better
How to get a seizure 101
Was not expecting a blast beat in a SOAD song.
🇨🇱♥️
Beating the devil,  we never run from the devil, we never summon the devil, we never hide from the devil!  Kick em in the teeth SOAD its about time they came back.....Kept us waiting..
I LOVE YOU

You are a real part of the Culture. Respect. I'll give for Armenia. Even if everyone gave 1 Euro it would be great. It would isolate private interests as well.
Sounds just like their debut album days, i love it!
very cool 🤘👍
♥️♥️
Damn this is so good.
You need to receive  THE MESSAGE and educate yourself with what happened in Armenia. Soad got together because of this issue. Pay respect, research what this is about.
this song is so amazing!!! I love SOAD...
I 💚 SOD
This gonna be popular
Boys, c'mon, sort your shit out between each other and KEEP making awesome music...love you guys 🤘🏼😈🤘🏼
Amazing video, what else can I say
Levei anos para gostar deles mas foi bom. São originais com estilo que refrescou a musica.
SOAD RETURN!
Amazing 👏.
Awesome! SOAD!!!!! 🤘
Their music was never good and it never will be . I dont know how people listen to this garbage!!!! compare this bullshit to slipknot or BMTH . this is garbage .
Notice how the clips of john are shaky to cover up his cyborg form
Musik yang mencerminkan keadaan seluruh dunia saat ini hahaha ketawa iblis Humanity genosida
I see everyone commenting on how SOAD made great new music and rejoice! But nothing about the video, the symbolism is strong with this one and I love every part of it and am all for it
SERJ LOOKS MAGNIFICENT!!!!
Greetings from Malaysia! 🇲🇾🤘✊
Hell yeah 😁🤘🤘🤘🤘
What a bad song
A W e. S omE  ;)
Wow, so soon after the song came out
AWESOME
Grammy for sure
1:19 SOAD turns black metal
Они живы оказывается
Who else didn't expect to hear blastbeat from SOAD?
Just make a new album please
Muito bom
I like it
Наконец то вы вернулись, так держать)
I don’t even listen to Rock an This Songs Hard Asf

this is sick wuhooo
ta chida la cansion 10/10
⚠️ Epilepsy content ⚠️
te amo parabens
Good one!
I only wish it was still Toxicity vocal ratio. Like 70/30 Serj to Daron. Love how heavy it is though!
It's too sad, when i hear you all together  You are the one of the best rock group, what i hear and see  I really glad you all ))
Waow
Awesome
.
I think it's fair to say that it was well worth the wait
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲

I dont know man. . .i dont know
Oh, System of a Down released a music video for Genocidal Humanoidz.  That’s a nice birthday present.
Fighting the devil we never run from the devil!  Love it!
Message, video, and music, WOW "Guess who's coming over to dinner"
So are they back together finally ?? If so I can't for them to drop albums again
1:19  So anyway I started blasting
Wow Come Back🤘
faaa volvieron con todo!!! esta buenazoo
Temazo csm! Humanos matando a Humanos 1:20 Black Metal Riff
long live to SOAD
Not impressed at all... Old system still better than whatever that call this shit!... Sounds like a shitier version of a scars on broadway song lmao... Much like today's US government it's a system failure 😂😂😂
OMFG. Thank you for the song n8ce to here ur voice again.
Serj you are a sic👌😬
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk-4rkUEBNI
Back to the 2000's !
The ending....💜
Awsome ✌🏾
Why would anyone dislike this
não é mais o system que conhecíamos ,mas é bom
Salam dari Indonesia 🤘❤️
Sempre incrível
AMAZING 🔥🤘🇵🇪
they just never get old, they still as great as in the 2000'
I'm 34 and this made me feel like I was in highschool again
WOW
John is amazing. What an incredible drummer
Epic
From israel
It's so good to hear this. I needed this in my life
🔥🔥🔥 Wish we had more artists like you guys
they still got it
Great lyrics. Great video.
Похоже должна произойти Третья мировая, чтобы система записала новый альбом ((((
So happy they're back again.   P.S. - They're such ardent patriots of their motherland, it's amazing and breathtaking! We have to be grateful to their Armenian ancestry for that. Who knows when will they be back if it wasn't for their ethnicity.
Not as good as they used to be . . .
i love u 2021 <3
O Marcos Mion eh vocalista?
Been over ten years since these guys were together...  Perhaps we can get another certain band that's been on Hiatus for over a decade back together. Cough *Mudvayne* Cough.
Привет эпилептикам ))) зачем камеру трясти так ? , песня норм )
Marcos Mion???
🔥🔥🔥❤️
FINALLY
They should stop doing shows because it’s been TOO MANY FUCKING YEARS. THE FANS GOT TIRED OF WAITING AND NOW NOBODY FUCKING CARES
Nice video
What kind of line is “guess who’s coming to dinner, genocidal human or whatever the fuck. It’s terrible and not creative at all
😎
No effort from Daron really either, there is no fantastic screaming like there used to be. God fucking forbid
Lyric here,if you want to sing along  Can you see us?  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  You, me, us, them  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can you see us?  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Persecution ends now  Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids Teaching warfare to their children The bastards that will be destroyed Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can you see us?  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Persecution ends  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil
The music sounds like shit and it sounds like absolutely no effort was put into it. Serj looks fucking dead in his eyes like he doesn’t even want to sing anymore
They should’ve done something in 2017 when they said they would and MAYBE people would’ve been more hyped. You fucking idiots took 4 more god damn years too long, especially with the “hiatus”
It’s honestly not that great, it’s fucking terrible compared to ANYTHING they’ve made in the past
legalzinha a música  .-.
Welcome Back awesome Stuff keep going this way like it love it
Lo MAXIMOO!!!! Los amo!!!!! <3
Ну ничего так! Драйвова, старики вспомнили молодость) жаль только что для этого пришлось ждать войну 🙄
Eles voltaram 😋
-min 0:00001 of the song -oh this is soooo SOAD <3
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes  This is a awesome 2021 start  Who else here before 1 milli before this blows the devil
Fooking hell! Blast beats!!! And black metal-ish riffs!!
Do I feel like  an album is coming soon  I sure hope so.
God, I'd sell my soul for SOAD to do a DC show in the near future...
O Serj ta parecendo muito com o Marcos Mion hahahaha
Didn‘t know Cristopher Lee had a Band
me has a seizure 10 times watching this
Espero que ningún epiléptico vea esto
I understand thier message, but this song just ain't me.
Heartbreaking listen thie music
Makin tua makin jadi
New SOAD and john playing blasts. So much unexpected yet wholesome content
Just looking at the music, this song isn't nearly as good as the old stuff, pretty disappointed. Sounds more like a SOB song...
Still killing it. Nasty riff. And a blast beat. So good.
Comentario en español?
Excelente <3
It's like a mixture of many different SOAD songs, I like it!
so heavy...
It’s about time we get some new music from System of a Down amazing group
Woww, we got some new Ben 10 episode
We are back baby 😎🤘🏻
Them: We didn't commit any genocides. You deserved it tho.
yesss back to the roots I LOVE THIS SOUND RAWRRR
Good message
❤️
System of a down feat. Marcos Mion
It was very Tennacious D for this song. kkkkkkkk
Brutal  🖤
very nice
Love it ❤️ 🇦🇲
Hermoso simplemente hermoso
Always good, great band, great guys!
Thats why my system is always down............fucking love this band!!!!!!
Tal vez la voz de Serj perdió fuerza pero solo lo hizo para ser más hermosa  S.O.A.D  <3
please never stop!!
System..... The Fucking Beast!!!!
Old age looks bad ass on Serj lol
I hope he's back to stay, I love these guys❤️🤘🔥
Makin tua makin keras, band anak muda sebelah malah dari deathcore ke elektronik mellow, SOAD Josss 🤟🔥🔥
😲Pqp!! 🤘🏻
Mantabbb
My blood is jumping like I was 18 years old.
Bannggeerrrr
Man, this one is a killer song. I particular liked that they've gone from pumping alternative metal to full throttle black metal on 1:20. Also, very powerful music video of the crisis that is going on in Artsakh and Armenia.
They blessed us with a new song and a fundraiser at the same time. Not all heroes wear capes.
Buenos días quien Lee este comentario no hay nada bueno iniciar el año y el día con un buen elemento musical 😌🖐️👏
Que viejo está serj
John dolmayan So understated So underrated  Absolutely adore his playing
Oh mine, i can't believe it.
Foda! 🤘
No se separen :(
GREAT!!! MISS YOU GUYS
every time he yells, I moan a little bit (just a little bit)
Hellooooo????? They are my favorite Band since 2007 when i was 8 years old, and I used to see their videos in my old PSP. (Now I have 22) what a memories 😭
Great song
Can we talk about the smooth ass animation?
Lejos lo mejor del 2021 gracias por esta canción
genocidal humanoid...  la mayor inspiracion para esta cancion  ha sido alvaro uribe velez de colombia, nada mejor lo describe
Woah
That's the SOAD I remember.
1:19
Rockers who are for peace and humanity its awesome ! You are legends🙏🎶
Everyone  : SOTD are old, can't be relevant these days SOTD : Hold my blast beat.....
On one hand is so nice to see new SOAD video, but on the other I really miss their style that was on Toxicity. I wasn't the biggest fan of Mezmerize/Hypnotize.
bruh
.
Daron the BEST
blast beats holy shit
Guys , the first live I ever saw was  in Athens at '98 Slayer, opening SOAD. I was 15 back then, still remember the behaviour of some fans throwing objects at your band, was a complete disgrace. I didn't know you back then, but i gotta admit you did a great job surviving 20 years after and being as popular (and even more in next generations ) as the ultimate beast : Slayer :D I wanted to tell you that although we might not see you again in Athens, you ought to know that lot's of people love you here and pray for a live. Great new video btw!
1:21 damn i love this part its like black metal atmosphere
We need SOAD now more than ever this was such a breath of fresh air
system of a down es como mi papá, viene, me entretiene y se va
Проповедь ебаная
Wow. I, and many others, needed some new soad. Hope to god this isnt just a one off thing and maybe a new album is in the works! Even if there isnt though glad to see some new stuff from you guys!
Kill COVID with SOAD
this needs an epilepsy warning (seriously)
Hell yeah🎼😈
😳😳😳😳🤟🔥🤟🔥🤟🔥
Now thats not that hard to do now aint it?  Now go make some more
Why am I not subscribed to one of my favorite bands of all time? I'd love to see you all live sometime.
Wow....Bravo guys......I'm sure it took a lot of bs to pull through for this......but you did....I'm so glad you're the bad I always thought you were ......buncha badass mfs...... RESPECT
My heart starts beating again ❤️... My childhood is back
Great 😎😎😎😎😎
Old Soad! ✊
this song bangs
I stand behind this message.
SOAD style
🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿Карабах наш🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
tell the bitter truth, Serj! evil with human form should be gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn1wPEshvrk

Это охунно!
Man
Божечки-Кошечки!!! Они снова в деле! Сержу седина к лицу :)

Chingon
Это изумительно!
Los escuchaba yo. Ahora mis hijas. Increíble sonido, brutal letra. Gracias brothers.
Our country is coup-over by military right now this music lyrics give me strength. :)
Still got that unique awesome sound
Mais do mesmo! A criatividade acabou no hipnotyze
But Charles Manson did nothing wrong, between sacred science and sleep, but remember no one ever mentions God. You cant fight the devil on your own....
Lord protect us from the persecution of evil spirits and plans we pray you to  bless your nation. Amen!
Damn..love it...
Zellen está aquí!!🤣
This new stuff is boring. I don't want it to be. It doesn't matter how much you shake the camera, that song isn't that hard and it goes no where. Maybe the deep cuts are better.
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!
🇦🇲 🤝🏽 🇦🇷 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Shit! 1:20 we have black metal vibes here
The greatest comeback of all time...
System finally , im waiting my whole life for your return.
Nice song
Говнище
Waka Waka Flocka Rock on in RENO, Nevada MedicalMike 🖖
STILL HERE SEE YOU GUYS SOON MEDICALMIKE NELSON/SMOKEN HOT SURJ
Genocide? Comeee onnnn!! It was youu who captured our lands in 90s by killing thousands of azerbaijanis and making more than 1 mly people to flee from their homelands. Stop this bullshit
Am I the only one who sees the child(africa) crying on the world's map at 2:43 ? :O
The badass fast black metal riff in the mid is the exact right choice for the emotions.
For everybody this is a perfect song, but for us this is about our fight, where we were all alone.
Lets all remember that Serj was hailing Pashinyan and revolution in Armenia, when Soros' rats got in charge. Where Soros is - there is war.
serj looks like that one always angry grandpa ngl
How many B.Y.O.B. vibes you want? SOAD members: YES!  Great video for great song!
Феноменальная работа, бешеные рифы, глубокий клип и злободневный текст, а главное, все это за почти три минуты! Спасибо!
Finally...
SOAD: you, me, us, them. Rammstein: du, ich, wir, ihr!
Im so happy u guys are back! As always breathtaking
NOW WE'RE TALKING! YESSSSSSS
Самый крутой армянин в мире
It incredibly. Thanks.
So whenever Armenia loose a war these guys make music?🤔
🤘🔥
Other than the epileptic seizure I had with the flashing images at the speed of light, I think the video was cool
I really wanted to like it.
Пробирает до мурашек...
This is so amazing! Holy shit! I'm speechless!
WOW
May we have more please? It can't hurt to ask.
what about Palestine?
Спасибо Серж давно тебя ждали
Heavyyyyy
Наконецто дождались
im scared
yay!
FUCKING HELL!!! 🤘🏻♥️🤘🏻
YESSSS !!!!!
🤩🤩🤩
I can’t listen to their music in my house
😯
Умнички, я очень вас люблю. Вы гордость армянского народа, я очень восхищаюсь, вами. Дай Бог вам здоровья и вашим семьям. Вы большой вклад делаете Армении. Мы поделим!! 🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲

¡Excelente! Definitivamente volví a escuchar las raíces sonoras System Of a Down que tanto añoraba lml
Awesome!
🔥🔥🔥
influenciados por el Black Metal !!!!
System of Mass Hysteria ? "L'enfer des dieux" american soft version.
It´s so powerfull, You´re amazing!
if we assume that feces of creatures are what their organism considers waste . and we assume that devil is the incarnation of evil and we consider the world according to what we think is bad and what is good then , devil's feces ,which are the waste of the incarnation of evil ,would be holly
Nice little black metal riff there
Cool!!!!
Потрясающее
I envy people that got to see them live...good envy of course :-)
Me: *i'm not into Soad for just one day* Soad: *release a new videoclip* Me: Ah shit, here we go again
Yeah!!!!!!!! SOAD are back baby. 👍👍🤘🤘🤘👍👍
Why this video so short 😔😔
YEAAAAAHHHH 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hopefully this means more new music is to come out soon! 🤘
Liked when it got super heavy in that one section.. other than that . Ehh , it’s ok
Please guys don’t ever leave us again, I’m begging you 😭😭
glad daron got rid of that fucking stash
it´s all over armenian bros
I think they didn't lose their style. They still heavy.
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE THEM BACK AND REUNITED🤘🤓🤘  THIS WILL BE A GOOD GIFT FOR METALHEADS 2021🤘🤓🤘  #Can't wait for their New Album❤️
Sexiest thing I've seen from them since their debut album!!! Even more SO! Light and blessings in Hope's we all stand together in this time of humanity.
I want to enlist in the armenian army, but im in central america :(
The end of the world needed a soundtrack. So glad they are back.

That blast beat.. Oooof
This gave me chills
SOAD from Philippines
This song is so System of a Down, it’s great. What a damn shame they won’t make another album. They’re better together than solo any day of the week.
Enough about the genocidal guys, it’s becoming so boring!!!
1:37 = Oompa-Loompas
They r back everybody
I love this
Ave lord
Not so high!
Soy tan feliz en este momentoooo,  por diosss

system of a down. the rage against the machine of the 2000's. the voice of reason among the endless lies of the mainstream media
Incredible video! Seeing System of a Down UNITED again for such a beautiful cause is surreal.
Pogg.

I thought it said genocidal hemorrhoids at first. Then I clicked on it and read it lol
What's it gonna take for you guys to bring us a new album? Come on!
Honestly a really great return. Can’t wait to hear more, totally surprised by this.
OBRIGADO DEUS!  OS MONSTROS VOLTARAM

Cadê os brasileiros que são fãs Soad??
After listening I feel like back to SOAD era..almost forgot today already 2021
Q grandes sois me kago en la puta.
1:20 did system of a down just fucking go blackmetal???
🇦🇲🇮🇷 God bless
Ya regresen como banda 🥺
We have all been waiting on this so glad to see y’all come together and fucking jam 🎸
🔥🔥🔥
system of a down  shnorhakalut’yun ayn bani hamar, inch’ du anum yes hay zhoghovrdi hamar
Outstanding
Woooooooh !!!
Fuck yes
I'm so glad they decided to come back
GOD
Now,my life is complete when I hear this song !!!
Ta wena la cansion 😎👌
It makes my cry. It's beautiful to see how System of a Down creates another wonderful music.
I'm totally okay with tremolo picking and blast beats. Hope we hear more on the album, whenever that may be. Good stuff fellas!!
I liked that alot....
Like everyone else in these comments, I also like that they sound exactly the same because change is scawee.
💀🤘🤘
I also have genocidal hemorrhoids.
So glorious to see....
Wooooooooo 🥰😎😎😎😎😎😎
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love it ❤
Absolutely one of the Greatest Bands of All-Time. Missed you guys, could've used you during the Drumpf years...  ;-)
Agree with comment below they haven't lost a fucking beat even with all the internal strife God I love these Crazy Bastards
Guess who's coming over for dinner
Keep going guy you are the best!!!!
Cómo en los mejores tiempos de SOAD .! :,) ES PERFECTA.!
syria, palestine, rohingya, afghanistan, yemen, and all the persecution we receive from all parts of the world
Fuck yea!!
Ya deberían dejarse de puterias y seguir haciendo buena música, gran banda. 🤘🏽🔥🇲🇽
Everything about this band is tacky
THEY ARE BACK ( at least for a moment )
en mi opinion es el mejor video que e visto de system of a down siiiiiiuuuuu
Don't even want to watch this. SOAD I've listening to for over 20 years is just a political band now.
Yeah I enjoyed that! Glad to hear them back
the lyrics great everything else extremely generic
...OHH THANK GOD!!! absolutely amazing
Great song!!
serj looks  so different
"No, they're not metal, they're so much more than..." *John Dolmayan throws in blast beats*
The world missed soad 😢
Finally...and  good ..awesome  i Love it
John Dolmayan has no business playing drums on this song, and with this band any more.
This is SOAD...
Tremendous
As always, great two minutes, thanks System!!!!
01:19 That Blastbeat Part Was Black Metal AF
Hllly sht! This was insane! Thanks for you guys! Miss this so much! Love u all!
This is simply amazing!!! After so many years, it's really good to hear true SOAD! They sound exactly as 20 years ago!
woow
LRPMQLP ME ENCANTA 😍😍

Foda-se se 1 mil não gostaram.  121 mil amaram!
Que música foda com intenção foda quem e BR comenta essa obra linda

ON FIREEEEEEEEE
SOAD will always be their  shadow of Toxicity days. This song is hardly a 2/10  Also the map in the end is wrong
Marcos Mion foi pro System? kkkk
Eu adorei esse som👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Serj lovely and so handsome.
The audio: Yeah... This song is good... The audio + the video: Holy fuck!
I like how Daron's voice has evolved since older albums like Mezmerize and Hypnotize. Back then it was much more whiny, whereas Serj's has become more whiny which is evident at 1:39
Holy shit!! They’re back!!! Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Yes simply yes I’m Francewall mortaries
oh it would be so perfect....Everething....would be just fine....
É impressionante o quão talentosos são, e como as músicas sincronizam ao batimentos cardíacos!
Asome
Putain les mecs vous nous manquez grave. J'aimerais tant un nouvel album.
Prostitutes who prosecute... is Hitler Harris our VP. LOVE IT
Caralho, me sinto na época da escola novamente. Tentava enfiar system na cabeça dos meus amigos. Que satisfação gigantesca em saber que tem som novo deles após tantos anos.
Noldu Paşinyan
the only band that makes me feel like overthrowing any government
Best ..... thing ...  in .. all ... 2021!!!
Great start of a new year, shit bands are getting popular again.
THIS IS THE SOAD I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
Pqp q foda vcs SOAD estou muito feliz pelo som novo de vcs! Viva
why so good??
This song feels so weird but it still shows they can make good songs.
vontade de fazer algo mais obrigada
😱 😱 😱
1:20 that part its like a black metal song
Заебись петь о том, что ебать Азербайджан зло , а вот Армения ничего плохого не сделали :)))

Земля Родная помнит Вас! :) Вы красавцы!
1:20 is this black metal
Damn guys! I honestly love how they still sound like System of A Down 🔥🔥 Still stand true to who they are and giving me nostalgic vibes
Outfuckingstanding
❤️❤️ Por essa eu não esperava!
Never in the same shot together :(
I really like that to a rock music they add drawings, or dolls, no sé si lo que dije es inglés pero bueno ._.
I selfishly want them to get over all of their differences and JUST RELEASE A NEW ALBUM.
protect the land
Stand together
How is the fact that this vid is bellow 1M possible?  Edit: 1M!!!!
woooooow!!!!!!!!!!!!  \m/
Yes! Please come back. Serj, I know you wanted to move on to different things. But please. This is magic. We miss you all. We are waiting. If you want some "SOD" type material right now check out Scars on Broadway. Come get some Catspit~!
So good!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
армяне нич.
ToxiCity 2000
O bom e velho rock in roll com suas críticas
Fucking amazing, SOAD was the best show I ever went too they haven't skipped a beat
FANTASTIC!
1:20 :O let's start black metal riffs ImI.
😱
Можно таким же макаром и альбом полноценный записать?
that was so metal that, I think I just shit myself!
Yeah!
Also other then waiting so long for a Tool Album. System of a down comes out next. Rock is coming back
Unica banda que nao abandona as raízes do rock
I am 38 years old and my Senior Paper in 2002 was on The Armenian Genocide. This is great knowing they can still rock like they never missed a beat and teach everyone about issues that never get the limelight. Just like now America on the verge on a new civil war.
😮
Vê-los juntos novamente acalma minha alma🤗
Brazil is with you System of a Down! Brazil is with you Armenia!!!
New Album PLEASE...!!!! Amazing song.
impressive
The gray beard reminded me of how old I am.
Everyone liked that!
ТОП
Awful.
Good. Very good. Fucking very good!!!!!!!
Yeeees brothers sick music video keep up the good work <3
this is amazing ! viva SOAD viva Armenia !!!
I wonder how long before they're just Scars 2.0? Daron seems a bit like a control freak with creativity.
This is the system of a down like i want to ear!!
Un gros 👍de Marseille France
This is the SOAD fire we all are longing for..... MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE \M/
Well that was an assault on the senses. But not in a good way. Maybe should have stayed on hiatus 😂
The boys are back !!!
Fuck Yeah.
The SOA fomula of music writing is back
thx for the seizure

HINO DE GUERRA!!!!!
MARAVILHOSOSSSSS
Serj looks like young Saruman in those flashing lights
Kinda bomb again
Wow, welcome back S.O.A.D. We had were waiting for this!
The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start.   That's epic!!!
As an Armenian the song gives you chills from the song itself and the meaning
SOAD was my first concert ever.
They still got it!
THEY ARE THEY !!!, always was!!!, excelent song!!!
Who agrees with the fact that  Serj Tankien now looks similar to Tom Araya of Slayer?
This makes up for 2020. SOAD is amazing.
Perfect timing SOAD!  Havent had chills like that for a while.🔥🔥🔥
It really sucks that people have to suffer like this. Spread the love ❤️
Yes
אחלה בחלה מה הקשר 2021 סיסטם מוציאים שיר
terrible...sistem es lo único que está bien en el mundo
You are fantastic!  Thanks for everything you do, thanks for not giving up!
Fuuuuc.! 👍👍👍👍👍
How can this band make this song and then have a racist member lmao
wow Blast beats in SOAD! Was not expecting that
Пиздец ахуенно соскучился по вам )
Did they run ???
Wait, is this new????
YESSSSSS!
El comentario en español que buscabas bro
This song could easily be on the Toxicity album and it would fit. Nice song, very old school SOAD. It's a shame we don't have a new album, if it was all like this song it could be a great album!
Do you think this is their way of ending the band? I was just wondering that because I have this window at my room and I could see myself jumping out, you know? But don´t worry
👍👍👍
Yeeaaaah 🤘
Absolutely love this 🥰😍🥰😍🥰
Soad on the right side of history
Rock is back
ABOUT FUCKING TIME! MAGIC!!!!
Wow il love it
I love this songs! I miss you so much. Your lyrics have changed my life. I'm Looking forward to a new album.

SOAD special genre: *Historic Metal*
They're fucking back!
🔥🔥🔥
1:20 black metal feels
Yeah humanoidz
I love System, to this day. But I must admit, it feels weird to feel "honesty" in this clip, now that I know the drummer is a pro Trump, anti immigration, far right activist... is like, the lyrics says something, but the actual opinions differ completely.
Finally  holy fuck
Clip Maravilhoso
It's sad that war had to come for SOAD to record a new song together.
Protect the Land is better.
Absoluty AMAZING! been a fan for, wow 21 years now. The older I get an the more I see the more I understand and agree. You are all amazing.
Спасибо!
Who else want to see TYT get trashed by SOAD??
😍🎸🤟 cool
Wow, guys. The beat, the voices, the video, everything. I'm so glad you came back, especially for something so important. Please stay with us, SOAD!

Aveces siento ganas pero después pienso que haría que se sientan mal por andar tocando mierdas como si fuese la puta cura.
Real genociders and backstabbers interpreting a weak empire (which was fighting against all imperialists) as deamons and everbody supports. No body makes research about history, how these ppl avoid to make debate with documents. Thats the world we in. Majority is stupit.
KEEP IT UP!!! KEEP SAYING THE TRUTH @SYSTEM OF A DOWN !!!  SPIT THE TRUTH
О,новое видео от системы) круто получилось парни)
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤤
kaybettikleri her savaşın adı genocid

Oh my fucking GOD PLEASE tell me there's a new album in the works, seeing new music from you makes my life many orders of magnitude better. Awesome stuff, thank you so much.

It really sucks that SOAD can't pull their heads out of their asses to do a full length new album. It sucks more that it took more atrocities against Armenians to get them to come together and write. It sucks even more that Armenians are forced to suffer more atrocity.
We NEED SOAD!
Always great!
This song is unbelievable   The lyrics the sound   Promotes reason   genocide is happening   Its happening everywhere because   of the coronavirus   The genocide is the coronavirus   It was created by the government   To spread among the people   Then used to spread fear   And panic   And keep control of the economy   And people
Fantastic song!!! Fantastic video!!!  Fantastic group!!!
Finally you guys are back with the real System of a Down . Fuck yeah !!!!!!!
Эпилептики заценили этот клип
I know a lot of us are thinking this, but the intro always sounded like the song could’ve been a sequel to B.Y.O.B. That could’ve been on Hypnotize if it would’ve been written back then. Also, Shavo’s bass😍
Can you see us? Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start You, me, us, them Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start Can you see us?

I don't know how it is possible to have so many people who think that System of a Down is the best band of all🤮
Fuck the war! People should make love. <3 SOAD
I am proud of you Thank you for the energy, talent and patriotism 💋💋💋💗💗💗
Прекрасный клип, спасибо за талант,патриотизм, энергетику - you  are the best guys 💋💗💋
Очень круто! Их музыка прямо как бальзам для души!
WOW
Como los adoro🤩, breathtaking🖤
Just record that bloody album! ;)
Achei que era o rod halford no começokkkk
Outstanding.....say no more........
I like the animation. Gotta love hearing Serj and Daron’s voices together.
wtf! 2005 vibes on the loose!
Impressão minha ou o serj tá parecendo o Marcos Mion?
Daron looks deadly serious
This is horrible. The same words over and over. Terrible.
Yeahhh
This video is so SOAD and I love it.
Quem é brasileiro e está ouvindo em 2021
Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! God bless you guys for bringing these crimes against humanity to the mainstream...
so Proud of You ❤  🇦🇲
👍
Imagínense si sacarán otra cancion  ❤️❤️❤️
This is crazy, bacl to the 00's
Theyre Baaaack!!!!
this is good
estuvo buena la cancion
Yes!!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
This is amazing 👏 🙌 , seeing system of a down all together in a music video with a new song makes me feel like there is still hope for another album or more songs by them. It is also refreshing to hear there music again! They still have an amazing sound! Hearing this song, sounds like they kept writing music after their hypnotize album! 🤘👍 Absolutely Outstanding!!
Beautiful !
I love SOAD music!....but i hate to see Daron with out his iconic ibanez Iceman guitar! 💔
No one will forget this in the future because this will be legendary.
I'm a semi truck driver so I get to listen to music A LOT. My wife told me every time I send her a video, SOAD is playing. I showed her this and said "this is why" been a fan since they came on the scene! Smoked cigarettes behind school jamming out to this lol
Ad last🙏🏻😳🤗
new album please ?
I liked it,  before listening the song,  obviously
love you
Yooo did they drop a new album or just this song? Been waiting so long for more material from them.
Great job!! 💜
They just keep getting better John Dolmayan doing blast beats now? i'm so fucking mind blown with this bands talent
Me erizó la piel.
This is the heaviest I heard from System of a Down
Marcos Mion é você?
Marcos Mion?
This is absolutely beautiful!!!! 💗SO POWERFUL. I am SO happy and proud!!! As an Armenian Animator I am so so so MOVED. The visuals are -perfect-. The Animator you guys brought on nailed it! LOVE the visuals of the Other Side as literal demons.... because...well....... yannow... :/ Yeah.  Just brilliant and what I what have envisioned personally. Really brings home the message. So POWERFUL!💗💗💗KEEP DOING AMAZING THINGS FOR ARMENIA YOU GUYS! YOU'RE WONDERFUL! I LOVE YOU SOAD!💖💖💖💖💖
Exciting!
Wow considering they hate each other
A Black Metal vibe I've heard...
Insane...
Aaaah eu amoooo
Aqui no Brasil também tem um Genocida. Bolsonazi é um ignorante ultra corrupto, assassino, destruidor do meio ambiente e de tudo. FORA BOLSONAZI!
We need your music now than ever! SOAD and Rage.... I know both bands would have a lot to say about what's up.
SOAD ! es la mejor causa por la que se pueden unir, y siempre con su gran estilo, y definitivamente es muy buena la cancion
Brutal.
15 years of inactivity for this?  stop selling smoke
great!
This is amazing!  To see a music video from SOAD in 2021
That blast beat. ❤
Holy fuck it's like you were never gone.
Blast beat! Sounds very BLACK🤘
Esperei muito tempo por isso
Well.....it's System of A Down. Most likely the better songs are gonna be the B sides. Please don't pull a Chinese Democracy.
Been listening to the song for weeks now. Great to see this video pair up.
Yes
Eu Simplesmente Adorei 💜🤘🏻🇧🇷
Soad on rock in rio please
I was waiting for this for too long thank you guys
Greatest of all time ‼🤘❤🔥
👏👏👏👏
About time bro
Damn it that was great. That was system loved it
Holy fucking shit...YEEESSSS!!
The legend has returned... The world will open its ears again.
Serj virou o Marcos Mion maluco.
Serj ta a cara do marcos mion kkk Prefiro baroes da pisadinha
Mi adolescia sigue viva
Can't figure out how to play that guitar riff that goes with the blast beat lmao, just can't figure out playing it as a chord like that
Very nice ☺️
Brasileiro nunca deixa de ouvir S.O.A.D 🇧🇷🎵
Do crl 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Its sad that this war in your homeland is what brought you guys back together. We've all missed you guys.
Boy oh boy. They never missed a step after so many years apart. 20?~! It sure doesn't remind me of this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zuYNfTRyHM&list=PLFqFb9kKyBth1UHzdzpow6PAgzPWf6XDz&index=10
the quarantine brought us together to listen to the best riffs.
Incrível como o SOAD mantém até hoje o potencial deles intacto. Se realmente voltarem a fazer música juntos, eu nem vou saber viver tão feliz 👏🏼💕🙅🏽‍♀️
Serj está parecendo o Marcos Mion
Love love love! Thank you! 😊
They really woke up and chose to shock the world
OLHA ESSES CARA DE VOLTA MANO
Epic new music
You guys are back? Please say yes
The song last less then 3 minutes and has everything that we love SOAD for. Amazing
Please world start some war so SOAD can made a new album
The video is the best part of the song. Sorry System
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!! PLEASE COME BACK!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
I love this <3
Damn!
Nice vid soad:)

Greetings from Brazil!
i was chilling on Youtube and then i saw this, i was like daam this made my day !
Graeat Song SOAD! ASong that reflects what just happened recently in the world! Love you System
yeeeeeeeeessssss
Do the purple dots on the map symbolise anything specific? Like countries that recognise the Armenian genocide or something of the sort?
Shout out from Glendale! you guys rock!
Me encanta 👌 Ellos no cambian su estilo, sigue siendo perfecto 😌🌋
Army of Fans come to ARMENIA lets REVENGE  TOGHETER!🇦🇲🌎🌍🌏
Fodaaaaaa demais como sempre foram 🤘🔥
My soul shivers and has transcended my body with this video!
New album guys please. You are trying to raise money. Lots of people are helping out but if you guys did a new album? Open the flood gates. Do merch and everything. Think about it. Serge and Darrin can work together, this would be a destructive awesome album.
NECESITO MÁS DE ESTO JODER
10 million out of 10 million, much love
Beautiful. Just fucking beautiful.
SOAD is like Rammstein: they recorded so many great songs, we listen them on repeat constantly. They can sit back and relax. No new album is required, but it would be highly appreciated
Sigan así cabrones!  🇲🇽🤘🏼
Nothing has change 🖤
Can we all appreciate it so much Trump era is done and sod is back
You're amazing!!! Love you!!!💜
Quiero llorar de la alegría <3
SOAD Four Armenian Lions.
Wow. Classic form. I am not disappointed. Tasty track.
STILL GOT IT. STILL GOT IT. So good to see this from you guys. :)
Great Song , The proud voice of the right league
I still feel like I am in a bad dream and didn’t wake up. I didn’t think the Azeris would take our land so soon
fucking amazing!!! <3
THE WORLD NEEDS MORE CRANIUM BANGERS..... JUST ONE MORE HEAVY SONG SYSTEM OF a DOWN PLEASE....PLEASE..
Молодцы!)
My day is complete now! Holy Guacamole! Fuckin love it!!
Very, very good indeed
System of a down feat Mario Judah
👍
so simple and so good i love it, long live armenia
serj looks awesome with a full beard. even cooler than 1995 serj with long hair and full beard.
Sounds great, I was a bit skeptical, but they did not disappoint. SOAD
Y'all killed it and this is why I love listening to your songs so much
I can't believe i lived long enough to see a new system of a down videoclip.
Serj "Marcos Mion" Tankian
BEAUTIFUL
🇹🇷
At speed x2 is the funniest song ever😂
finally they coming back with devil heavy riff! lil bit sounds of black metal in mid chorus lmao 🤘🏻👹
thank you for coming back we needed this 🙌🏻🖤🖤
AWESOME!!!!
It hurts my heart knowing these may be the only new cuts we're getting from System but the fact they made a video together kinda gives me hope.  Even knowing these were Daron's unused SoB songs, the fact is that it FEELS like System.  I hope Serj, Shavo, and John get hungry for it again someday soon and we get our family back.
👍✌👏
Прекрасны, впрочем, как и всегда!
We need more SOAD!
Um lixo, parece marcelo d2
Muy bien pero le falto mas iwachu!!
way better than the two other ones!
rager.
2021 e os caras com o mesmo som de 2005. Que sonho maravilhoso é esse.
They are still just working fine 💕 please soad stay and make more music we need you know more than ever
❤️💙🧡
Finaly 😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎
With Genocidal Humanoids they mean the Turks right?
Edgy sissies  are tough after C0MM13 B1D3N is in office, they come back. ANT1 U.5.A. they are.
🤔🤔
fuck yeah !!!
This song is so fantastic! Watching the video is amazing but listening to the lyrics is even better💞🙏🏻
The greatest band ever. You guys rulez!
Sick track boys!
Absolutely smashed it, amazing work. Hopefully my donation will help people out with some food and shelter and water and all that stuff.
1:20 Mike Smith is proud
YES!
Todo lo que hace esta banda es bueno
Simplemente épico, thanks SOAD !! ❤️❤️❤️
Amazing! Thank you SOAD. I love you guys!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Как всегда всё сделано на самом высоком уровне .
🧐🤘
FUCKING LOVE THIS BAND!!!..💯💥💣🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Незабудки по всюду
absolutely incredible another good hit to get me through the day
Оооох, это нечто!!!!  Обожаю вас, мужики!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Daron has gotten very good at vocals after a very rocky start lol. Its a shame Serj lost his voice over a decade ago and adopted a very nasal style to his singing. Them both at peak performance at the same time would have been awesome. Regardless, love them.
A pure, energetic, remorseless punch in the face... I am in love.
System of down
This isn’t that great
I love your videos and if you could say hello I'd be fine 👌👍😁

What impresses me the most of you as a band is that is like you’ve never left.  You still sound like the first time I listened to your music.   Great video guys.  Greetings from Spain.
SUPERRRRRRRRRR
1:20 to 1:40 drummer and blackmetal 🤟
HELL YES. ABSOLUTELY HELL YES! THANK YOU FOR NOT ONLY CREATING OUTSTANDING MUSIC BUT FOR ALWAYS SPREADING AWARENESS TO The Armenian Genocide AND ALL ISSUES AROUND IT!
noble attitude
Aguanteee system !!! 🤘
That was amazing. Glad you guys are working together again. Hopefully we can spread peace around the world someday. Love you guys
hail from Serbian-ARIEVS Slavics

Great job, guys, Shnorakalucyun!
How long has it been😱😱😱😱😱
I can’t understand why this still sounds like scars on Broadway instead of system
I feel the devil is just came into the white house
Что порождает упырей?Для которых геноцид побочный эффект....
1:08 Me: aggressively headbangs with the monster

The cartoon portion is reminiscent of the autobiographical comic books "I Saw It!" & "Barefoot Gen" by Keiji Nakazawa, which tell his  story of being a child in Hiroshima, Japan during World War II.
Los amoooooo
Lets goo!!!!!!
👍🏻
This song rocks
Temazo
Adam Mason? the one from The devil's chair, Blood river, Broken and Pig among many other films? AND S.O.A.D.? This is a winner if the world has good taste.
AMAZING
Where you guys been?
Some of the best to ever do it!!! 🤘🏻❤️
Jesus Christ, it's like they just picked up right where they left of in the mid 2000's!
Están tan hermosos como el día en que se fueron.

We as the citizens of Myanmar do not agree with the current situation and would like to request the world leaders. UN and the world media, please help our country- our leaders- our people - from this bitter acts.  We want democracy and want our country to develop as our neighbouring countries.   #savemyanmar
CRÍTICO!!!!!!!!!! lml
Where is   nik nocturnal🤟

It's worth waiting for more than a decade. Sincere love and respect from Nagaland.
1:20 black metal
Amazing video!!
Tankian tá parecendo o Marcos Mion, e depois das declarações do baterista não dá mais pra acreditar na ideologia do SOAD...
New SOAD! Still angry, crazy and kept their sound. Kick ass stuff!
WOW! write an album already)
Cried!
che cazzo di bomba è questa
Hell yeh i like this System
When I listen to this song, I'm all over my body. Amazing! ❤️
AMAZING!!! 🤘😁❤️

Serj is like a angry dragon 🔥❤
Love you!♡
1000 unlikes from turkish government
Huuuge 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘❤
Everyone worldwide should be grateful "we" still have System Of a Down! Genocidal Humanoidz is "perfect" in my humble opinion. One of their best songs and videos! (I have been following them since Sugar aired on Much Music in Canada) superb! keep it up!
!!!!!
Me emocionei demais com a música em si e com a mensagem. Gratidão banda!🇧🇷
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAabqOMRBRdJVaj7sZM0dcA
1:21 to 1:30 sounds like black metal
top 10 anime battles
Звук мощщщщаа!!!
Don't be the devil...
💜🔥🔥🔥🤘🏼
Maybe new album coming?
Not to be a Debbie downer or anything... buuuut I don’t see a single scene in this music video with Daron and Serj together. Maybe it means nothing. I don’t know. I love system so much I don’t even give a fuck. I’m just saying.
SOAD thanks for this great performance Serj you are a LEGEND!!
Thank you for comeback😍😍🙏🙏
You never dissapoint 🤧
Is there some explanation of the map at the end?
SOAD - the best ever!
surreal! i was just clicking through the "system of a down" album beein all nostalgic and shit and now i see they put up a new song yesterday! haha what
And now we wait for the angry turks
Que fodaaaaa!!!!
2020-2021 has been wild
🔥👌
Kids, learn from papa! This is how metal is done!
✊🙌
Amazing to have them back. I've listened to System since I was 11 years old🔥🔥 super happy to hear the metal flow..... And Terrorists....WE WILL NOT STOP!!!!!
Glad 4 this. Yess
I really hope Armenia is gonna be free one day, art is there to help l think in some ways, it's really sad to know what's going on out there and some other places.
Por 2 minutos e 49 segundos sorri de emoção. Depois de anos ouvindo soad e ver o hiato dos íntegrantes, por 2 minutos e 49 segundos fui feliz novamente como a anos antes.
Comeback
Missed you guys!
Pls make another song like Chop Suey
We will never make an album again.....off to see them all together in a live video.......
This is the start too 2021 we all needed !!
We need more stuff like this ✊🏼 great job, love it.
իսկական Հայեր։ real Armenians.
We like the Donate!
YESS
Nice they're back! 🤘😄
Arribaaaa
yes
A los turcoides imperialistas no les gusta ésta canción.
https://youtu.be/FTJkkSvakeE
When the society gets shittier, they return!
Musically it's 5/10 but the cause is more important. Good to have them back
Holy shit, that was awesome. This is above music, I can’t explain it but wow, I hope you guys are able to accomplish your mission in defending your motherland.
Армянский мальчик с рогаткой - это образ армянского народа, который преданный всеми и не получив должного вооружения воюет с турецким террористами, вооружённых по последнему слову техники.
Se eu amo? Amo muitooooo. ..
Old Serj is better for me:DD Hi's like pshyco grandad))
Good song of Scars on Brodway...
That grand black metal part in the middle🥰
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhmH5ig11NI After premiere I recorded small folk-medieval cover of this awesome song, please, check it out :)
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Just like before, new S.o.a.d. Song on Loop all damn day!
Gran cacata questa canzone. Peccato.
🇦🇲 🇦🇲 🇦🇲
free palastine and free armenia.
Thank you SOAD,  o Brasil precisa dessa força de protesto! FOGO NOS FACISTA!!
FRISSONS ******
Now they could make a whole album to raise money. If they can write 2 songs than I’m sure they could make at least a 10 track album. I know they can do it. We are still relying on older bands to make decent music because allot of the newer bands are lacking that decent rock sound.
SOAD is the best fucking anti-war band on the planet. pure talent from all of them.
I don’t know if I should be thanking or scorning SOAD for this nightmare inducing music video
BIENVENIDOS AGAIN  ❤DESDE  MÉXICO  🇲🇽🌮🍺

"The prostitutes that prosecute have failed us from the start" that's the best definition of Kamala Harris I've ever heard
Another boomm💥
You guys should do a virtual concert with proceeds going to the fundraiser. I'd be in 100%.
keep strong Armenian brothers....Love and support from Greece!
2 months waiting for Official Video  of second song from newest album . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . worth it

MAN THIS IS JUST BREATHTAKING.
Why did serj talk crap about TRUMP not cool. It's not his fault that.  That happened to ARMENIA 🇦🇲.  I am ARMENIAN just cause he couldn't stop it. Its not his fault.  Every president that we had in the past wasn't able to help ARMENIA.
OMG FUCK YEA! 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏼🤟🏽🤟🏿🤟🏾🤟🏻🤟🏼🤟🏽🤟🏿
Tem brasileiro aqui?
Love it!
System.... Chegou chegando curti pra carai essa música

Finally, after 15 years!  Awesome as f*ck for me to see all of you together again as a band. Let's "pull the tapeworm out of your ass."  Greetings from me for all of you for making this awesome lyrics, song and video.  - Human from Indonesia
I fucking LOVE this!!!! Welcome fucking BACK!!!
por fin nueva cancion la puta madre
The animated video looks a lot like the one from "The wolf" of the "Siames"!
John 3:16-17 16-For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
It just me or the drumer of soad look like the actor who played mahogany in meat night train?
Simply wow ...
Really thankful your still sticking to your cause.  And that your not bowing to the system. Of today's bullshit cancel culture.
Si good! Diría el gabacho
I was afraid I wouldn't like how serj was gonna sound in an aggressive system song these days, but he's really properly utilized. Everyone is.  If they cohld just get out of their own asses and put a few more songs together.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16
ITS ABOUT TIME....... 2021 NEEDS SOAD
Cadê os brazuca daqui ?
If this song and protect the land doesn’t give you chills. You’re not Armenian.
I’m so hype right now!!!!! Fuck this is my favorite band
Ya con 30 años
Oh my God
Welcome back boys
I couldn't b happier ty guy's so much for the new album!!! I luv system of a down
Marcos Mion tem banda, cara
Excelente 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 Colombia presente
I love you guys .. #SOAD FOR LIFE

Love you, Daron ❤️
The animation makes this a masterpiece
A hint of extreme in there maybe? 😏😉
We miss you
Humanz, Ruben from Donetsk (DPR, ex-ukraine) here. Very nice job! Venceremos!
0:03 did they just called Armenia's attackers 'geh'?
Awesome!!!
Looks like the hype died
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruh, just make an album and donate a percentage of the profits to the cause you guys are fighting for.  Half of the songs can be written by Shavo and the other half by Serj  That way everyone is happy   Easy peasy 🤷🏻‍♂️
Um grande e forte abraços do Brasil,  seus filhos da mãe lindos  !!!!

Long Live Armenia 🇦🇲
Finally, Angry Serj voice...!!!
This song is my favorite flavor of SOAD
I'm not sure what they are talking about but they are mad about something...not  a fan
This is so good. Soad is back.
DİSSLİKE .. TÜRKİYE İÇİN
Marcos Mion
I was sad to see none of them together in one shoot. I would have loved to have see a big band shot of them all playing and rocking out.
I will never not be attracted to Daron.
Yeaaaa Old style 👊🏻✊🏻💪🏻💯
Phenomenal
Life is a waterfall We're one in the river And one again after the fall good to have you back
Estoy felizzzz
Eis que chega essa maravilhosa notificação desse clipe!!!
Boomer metal
Não sabia que o Marcos Mion cantava.
This song sucks. It's like they were forced to make a song rather than wanted to make one
It is righteous to come together when the fact you might have personal differences in your relationship as human beings becomes the afterthought, but you realize that your common calling and what you are able to do as a collective could be the right thing to do. That is what I see here. They did not want to make music together anymore - now here they are. Maybe this foreshadows something, maybe they will - beyond this - find a way to look past whatever let them drift apart and they can summon their energy as a band again and their friendship. The same way the summon the strength and heart of the people here. Would be just fitting. And if it sounds like this or ever bigger and more "SOAD" - I would love to hear a full record again.
Resist ✊
It's beatiful to see this.
Serj tho. Incredible video gentleman
♡ॢ₍⸍⸌̣ʷ̣̫⸍̣⸌₎
This is fucking demonic
🇫🇷✊🇦🇲
it's a dream come true
This went from thrash metal to death metal to whatever SOAD is. Such an amazing song.
Me .. us ... we .. miss you .. 🤘
The king serj 🔥🔥
YouTube: new song from SOAD Me: LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!
SOAD is providing what we all need right now, METAL. Thank you
Dude this song sucks
system of a down is back
Serj looks like Jason Mantzoukas in the video and I love it
This song needs screaming
si hubieran seguido sacando álbumes habria mucho mas rock/metal apareciendo en tendencias
Dude, this animation is amazing! Hope whoever did this does more music videos for SOAD
Brasil por favor 🙏🏻 ❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷

system sempre FODA
Makes me sad they will still probably never make another record but getting 2 new songs is still fuckin awesome
🇦🇲🙏 we only fear God
God damn those blast beats were insane
woow!
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
As a turkish woman i cant listen to this it would be an insult to myself🤷‍♀️ i hope the band doesnt fully hate turkish people if so they are spreading racism around
Well this was an unexpected much needed surprise.
Thank you, SOAD.  Peace and love for Armenia. ✌
This song just rocks.

Man after all these years, these guys still suck.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yeeeeeeees. King's are back
DIE ERDE IST SCHON EIN SEHR FASZINIERENDER PLANET  Schade, dass ich wenige kennenlerne die an Gott glauben. In der heutigen Generation wird selbst an mehreren Schulen und Büchern eine Evolutionstheorie von zb. Naturwissenschaftlicher Charles Darwin gelernt. Mh, aus einer Zitrone wurde ne Melone und aus einem Fisch dann ... ein Mensch...   Auch wird in Schulen und Bücher gelernt wie optimal die Größe oder der Abstand die Erde zur Sonne ist. Auch wie perfekt die Umlaufgeschwindigkeit  die Erde um die Sonne hat (laut menschlichen Fakten würde bei einer viel langsamer  Geschwindigkeiten die Erde der Sonne so nahe kommen das sie sich in einen Wüstenplanet verwandeln würde usw.). Die Drehung der Erde um die eigene Achse (laut menschlichen Fakten hätten wir wenn's nicht so perfekt wäre eine Seite dunkel, die andere Seite hell usw.).  Sowie den optimalen Neigungsgrad.. Die Größe der Erde (angeblich optimal wegen der Schwerkraft),  die Atmosphäre, unser Magnetfeld, der Mond selbst der Jupiter hat seine Aufgabe und und und..  Natürlich sagen die Wissenschaftler was für ein Zufall das alles ist und verkaufen uns die Theorie fast als wissen..  Obwohl Sie selber sagen, sie sehen nur ca. paar Prozent vom Universum.  Naja... Schaut mal in den Spiegel wie schön unser menschlicher Körper ist. Was wir alles mit unseren Körper können: Wir fühlen, spüren, denken, sprechen, singen, schmecken, riechen und wir haben Träume..  Und unter uns Menschen gibt es richtige Supertalente auf ihrem Gebiet...  Auch hat unsere Erde atemberaubende Traumhaft schöne Landschaften die ganzen Bäume, Blumen und Pflanzen Wunder schön.  Oder unsere sehr sehr schöne Tier Welt,  wenn wir mal bei unseren Haustieren anfangen. Wie treu ein Hund ist, es gibt Blindenhunde, Rettungshunde..  Unsere Katzen die kleinen jäger und wie toll sie sich beim streicheln anfühlen..  Tauben die über Kilometern wieder nach Hause finden..  Glühwürmchen die nachts leuchten.. Chamäleon kann seine Farben wechseln.. Fledermäuse die Nachts sehen..  Spinnen die Netze bauen..  Quallen haben einen durchsichtigen Körper.. Pferde auf denen wir reiten können.. Ein Kolibri kann in der Luft schweben.. Ein Wanderfalke der im Sturzflug bis zu 250 km erreichen kann.. Bienen die nicht nur Honig produzieren sie bestäuben die Mehrzahl aller Wild und Nutzpflanzen.. Und und und es gibt über Millionen von Tierarten alle sehr sehr schön.   Auch wie lecker unsere Obst, Gemüse, die ganze Nahrung ist, in aller Vielfalt, lecker...   Für mich gibt's keine Worte so schön ist Gott. Wenn wir da mal aufs Alte- und Neue Testament schauen dann ist das erste und wichtigste Gebot, deinen Gott lieben von ganzem Herzen, mit ganzer Hingabe und mit ganzem Verstand.  Ebenso wichtig ist aber ein zweites:  Liebe deinen Mitmensch wie dich selbst.  Das sind doch tolle Gebote und die Nächstenliebe habe ich so in keinem anderen Buch gelesen..💕💕💕💕
nice....
Даааааа! Хочу еще)
The New World Order of Depopulation Humanity will be activated

Great song and video. ARTSAKH IS ARMENIA!
This is the SOAD that I always have loved! It's amazing hear them again!
System of  Down forever
It's telling that the better of the two tracks came from rehearsals where Shavo, Daron, and John arranged the song together, even if it was written by Daron.
Актуально 2021🇷🇺
Sigue siendo el viejo soad que me gusta escuchar.Que alegria que vuelvan a tocar. Falta riff igual; pero suena muy bien!
Ребята спасибо Огромное, за то что Вы делаете!!! К сожалению Мир обречён..

epileptic videoclipz
👏🏼
Check out the Tinnitus prank on my channel 😂
Liked cuz fundraiser
New record, please...
History relives itself.. always the same story happens start a war then lose it and caused many lives for nothing in ww1 they did  , after 1991 they did. They 've lost . There is no meaning to cry genocide out. its not called genocide its called war , please learn the history before telling lies. AND PLEASE SUPPORT THE INNOCENT CIVILIANS NOT THE TERRORRİST GOVERMENTS. hope the peace reign down on us all soon
А деды еще могут🤘🤘🤘
How sick, hateful and harmful the music and the content! Strangely enough Armenia is the only country that has 13 terrorist organizations and most “famous” ones are Dashnaktutun and ASALA!
fuck, dude. fuck yes.
This is just like summarized Swans
:3
Fantastic. Such a powerful nessage, this made me cry. Thank you, SOAD for shining a light on this tragedy and using your voice, the way that only you guys can, to help
Roar

DO YOU PEOPLE REALIZE THAT GOD LOVES YOU ALL??  HE SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON DOWN FROM HEAVEN TO BE TORTURED AND CRUCIFIED FOR YOUR SINS?  HE TOKE YOUR PLACE!!  WE ALL DESERVE HELL!  BUT CHRIST CAME AS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE!  HE SHED HIS BLOOD FOR ALL YOUR SINS....PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE!!  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT HE CAME....DIED...AND ROSE FROM THE GRAVE JUST FOR YOU!!  YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT HE IS THE MESSIAH.  YOU HAVE TO CONFESS WITH YOUR MOUTH THAT JESUS IS LORD!!  IT'S THAT SIMPLE!!  THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN IS THROUGH JESUS CHRIST!  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY!  AND HE IS COMING SOON!!  IN THIS GENERATION!  THE PROPHESIES ARE BEING FULFILLED AS WE SPEAK!!  ADMIT YOUR A SINNER!  ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR SAVIOR!  BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT HE DIED FOR YOU!  AND CONFESS WITH YOUR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD AND YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN WITH HIM FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER!!  NO MORE TEARS, SUFFERING, PAIN, DEATH, DESTRUCTION, DISEASE, ETC ETC.  JESUS LOVES YOU AND DIED FOR YOU!!!  ACCEPT HIM NOW AND BE SAVED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB!!!   Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  ROMANS 10:9
Fuck yes. Cant wait for what the future brings for SOAD🤘🤘
SOAD 🤘🤘
SOAD better than before and even then they were the best!
POR FINNNNN!!!!
Ахуенно короче
seeing SOAD back makes me so happy
Do nada
Trash
Serj and Daron's voice together is better than antidepressants.
Serj = Marcos Mion
I’m rewatching you see if they really did get Daron’s ego and Serj in the same room here... didn’t think it was possible.
Best wishes to Armenia, and the rest of the world.  We may be separeted geographically, but we stand together, as humans. Greetings from Brazil.
В неспокойное время вы живём, мысленно всех обнимаю💜
Wow
Magnífico regreso! Queremos más metal !! 15 años de espera y por fin están aquí !!
Aghhhhhhhh love this jam could litterally jus have it on repeat all day!!!!
BLAST BEAT!!!!
uuuuuuuuuuuu
The purple flower in the video is called the Forget-me-not in memory of The Armenian genocide (1915) official symbol & emblem for the 100th year memorial.  It has been 106 years since the  genocide & still no justice. Armenians are still fighting the same fight our ancestors did. Peace for Armenians. #RecognizeArtsakh
BRASIL 🔊🎵🔥
SOAD, AMAZING
System of a Down. I will always love you. I’ve loved you since I was young. And your music makes me feel so absolutely happy. Thank you for the music <3
Blessings to my Armenian Brothers 🇦🇲🇺🇸✌🏼We will never forget 🌸💜thank you for bringing attention to this atrocity in Armenia! 💔🙏🏼

ELES VOLTARAM COM TUDO AAAHHH <3 <3 <3
I don't want to jinx it but I feel like they coming back fully, they sound too good for this to just be a one (technically 2) off deal.
Por favor, por favor, voltem... 😭 please, please come back ...      😭 🙏🏿
🇦🇲🙏🏻
#SystemOfADownIsBack #ProtectTheLand
Serj tá muito parecido com o Marcos Mion😁🇧🇷
You know a band is something special when they return from a 15 year hiatus with a double single for charity and the music sounds better then it did before they hung it up.
Love it
Con el vídeo la canción me gustó más
RESPECT AND LOVE...
Спасибо
Perfect🇦🇲🦅
This is way better then protect the land but I get it, you need a boomer rock song for the radio. Really wish y'all could put away your differences and make a heavy, angry SOAD album.
❤❤❤❤❤
WHAT
Holy shit! New SOAD? *Pulls Needle out of Arm*
Que perfeição ❤️
Fuuuuu.....(

Ojalá se reúnan definitivamente y saquen un disco. Necesitamos que nos escupan verdades en la cara.
Прекрасно просто
Masterpiece
Still the best Band ever. I grow up with SOAD, and I will let my Children grow up with their Music to. Forever SOAD. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

best metal song of decade
🤍🤍🤍
Повод, конечно, не радостный, но как же приятно видеть СОАД снова вместе.
Did anyone notice you don't see Serj and Daron together on one angle? A clash of egos.
Aiiiinnn que maravilhoso 😍
Manda um salve pro Brasil
Неужели это произошло!
✊🏽

просто разъёб
НАМ НЕ НУЖНА ВОЙНА! 平安
System Of A Down ainda continua o mesmo Ótimo como sempre 🤘🎸
This is my band
Я так понимаю, это про очередной конфликт в Нагорном Карабахе?
*black🤘👿🤘metal* 🇲🇽
And again!.. Thank you very much, guys.
This is such a hypocrisy (why? Just learn the history of conflict: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict )... It makes me think that maybe  their statement about turkish genocide more than 100 years ago is a hypocrisy too?
I love soad, if only we could get at least one more album :(
Caraca mano, top d+
Hihihihi
Love this song ❤
I m from Russia, I m Russian. In our country Armenians lives in peace with Azer, and Uzbek, and Ukrainets and etc.
Is the title of the song about the armenian military in 1992?
Ficou muito bom.
From the  UK.... Got a support. Bro,s
Serj needs to unlock his final form and turn into a hippie wizard. Works with the angst and then also adds wisdom.
Ну наконец-то! Реюнайтед!  Тема болезненная. Но это тема СОАД
Isso é system of a down de verdade
QUE CE ACHOU NIMBA??
Конечно тут!
ohhh man where are darons beautyfull melodiebreakparts

They did amazing on this but I wonder what it would of sounded like if it were to stay as a Scars on Broadway song as planned.
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
omg..............
SOAD manteniendo esa esencia, ese sonido que le caracteriza 🤗
I cant believe to see you together in the video of youre songs,ago 15 years in new age) its powerful and strong,i was thought i never didnt see you together with youre music
Can finally tell someone to Daron, that nobody wants to hear him singing....
The sound of butthurt is strong in this song 😂😂😂
Qué Dios los bendiga, y que Dios bendiga a Armenia.  Ojalá el hombre dejara ese instituto violento, que sí bien es natural, provoca guerras innecesarias.
Greece supports Armenia 🇬🇷🇦🇲🙏🙏🙏
SOAD ♥️
Those drum patterns are so catchy to hear, that it is still stuck in my head.❤
Am I the only one that hears Scars on Broadway and Serj solo stuff (elect the dead) in this song but not really the “SOAD” sound. Just a thought.  Love the somg regardless.
Its the  real music to my ears
Альбом бы, и было бы совсем хорошо
Veri naici
Awesome Masters, I could not stop doing headbanding, you are amazing, greetings from La Serena Chile 🇨🇱🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻

Armenia would win if they would put SOAD playing in front of the trenches
You're so necessary! Please help to save Brazil!!
Sad to see most fans are fing stupid..missing the whole point. Just look at these comments
Love from Croatia 🥰🇭🇷
Oh maaaaaaaaan 🤩🤩🤩
System Of A Down, the world NEEDS you guys. Now, more than ever. Please, put aside your differences, and resume spreading our message.
Just fight bad's spirits,just fight together against.......for freedom!!!!FREEDOM!!!! Easy to speak about it,so dificult to MAKE IT,TO DO IT!!!
Never thought I'd see a music video for this song.  Also, that blast beat tho.
I think this video contains More flashes than the paparazzi
Kak zhe oni eboshat
Serji Tankian angry aggressive voice is super kickass awesome.
So good to see the guys together 🤟
The intro makes me remember BYOB's intro. Can't believe they are back!
Жарьте как в 2000 годы
This is the greatest thing ever made ever in the history of the world.
2:06 Question vibes anyone ?? (im talking about kid shooting)
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
How Daron can still be so funny?
Serj with the full beard looks awesome
The end of the video ♥️ the seeds of Armenia are everywhere!
bunların şarkı yapması için bi kan almak lazımmış :D
Legend will be legend..  #soadPhilippines💪
Surprised they are all in the vid considering dolmayan has pro trump views
vamoooooooo
¡El regreso más esperado en el mundo entero!
My fav band of all time ❤🕊
Мощно!!
<3
Glad to see the guitarist take a bit of a step back from singing duties, and let the real frontman be the frontman. The two-frontmen dynamic of the Mezmerize/Hypnotize era looked and sounded stupid. Daron already writes a lot of material for the band, is the guitarist and the backing singer: just what the hell you want more, you egocentric little thing.
The devil does not like this video   ( 666 dislike )

This is for 🇦🇲
🙏🙏🙏
*I don't really understand, what is your goal serj??? What do you want to do, if your country already lost on 10 November? You are spreading your propoganda everywhere.*
SOAD itself looks like Genocidal Humanoids
2:43 who didn’t install cs:s?
LEGENDS <3 <3 <3
This will cause epilepsy
Մեռնեմ Ձեր կյանքին.. 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
SYSTEM OF A FUCKING DOWN IS BACK!!!! HELL YEAH!!!!!
these Persepolis-style animations tho
*SOAD will never stop making propoganda everywhere, even if war ended on 10 November. They shamefully lost.*
Мурашки по телу...как всегда очень круто!!! Не думал что еще когда-то буду смотреть новые клипы и слушать новые песни!

I think the song should have started from that moment 1:20
it's Very cool!
- How much stroboscope we need? shavo - Yes
system of down makes surprise
YEAH!!!!!
I've heard this when it first came out but to see the illustration with........ MIND BLOWING
That moment you wake up and Daron Malakian is hovering over you, staring at you with crazy ass bug eyes...
System of a meshuggah

Never thought I’d see these guys together again.
Сильно, конечно. На высоте, как всегда.

Used to be a good group. Now This group is too much into dirty politics.  👎.
:]
"I did my waiting... 12 years"
Go headbang at 1:11, then just become a helicopter at 1:21.

SOAD FOREVER!
After all the reports of them struggling as a band, this is incredible to hear. I can sense a mix of Mesmerize and Toxicity, they're still the same unit as all those years before. Here's hoping they can keep up the momentum and we can experience more SOAD for years to come
thank you so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh LOTS OF LOVE FROM NEPAL.........................................
Masterpiece! Love this one much more than Protect The Land. But overall love how they still making songs together ❤ Virtual concert soon?
Amazing!!!
🔝 🔝 🔝
Cool video man
Անմոռուկը մենք էինք, սփռվեցինք աշխարհով մեկ,
трек шикарен, конечно. отцы еще могут. #хуй_войне

Awsomeone
This is happening! They're back
Doesn’t even actually look like daron and Serj were even in the same room.   Probs one of their worst music vids. What a disappointment.
Dang it, I missed the debut reveal and chat. Wow, I got chills. Great video, guys. 🙂👍👍
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Stay strong Armenia! Prayers from Mexico. 🙏🏼🇲🇽
Like si llevas años esperando algo nuevo de SOAD. Sígueme en instagram como @elgerentedelrock . Sigue vivo el metal en el 2021.
💪⚔️🙏🇦🇲
Que hace el muneco gallardo en esa banda! Grande marce 🤙🏻
Hermoso pero triste
Viva SOAD, cabrones!
Perfeição
かっけえええええええええええええええ
Excelente ! SOAD é uma das melhores bandas do mundo !
2021 😎🇲🇽😌
What flower is that?
Daron's band with Serj in vocals reminded me of old SOAD
It just shows that If they put their differences aside, they can create such a positive impact not only for Armenians but everyone around the globe.   The world has missed SOAD for far too long, and we need them more than ever. Much respect for raising funds for Armenians 🖤
Pure SOAD
Black Lives Matter, john. ✊🏿
México con ustedes! 🎼🎸🚬👊🏻🤜🏻🤛🏻
fuck yeah
SOAD are back..... SOAD are here..... SOAD we love.....
Soon to be America.
I got chills
SOAD was the best surprise of 2020, and now they are already the best of 2021.
2021 Is getting better after all 1:19 favorite part
This is genuinely awesome. Made my night for sure.

System of a down спустя 15 лет... И поют о войне, мировые армяне подняли шум. Где есть мир? Везде брязкают оружием. За смелость и возвращение спасибо! Вас намного приятнее видеть, набравшимися жизненного опыта и помудревшими)
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
from the thumbnail picture for a moment i thought it was Lauren Babic with a beard haha
good to see serj sharing the spotlight for once
year 2021 is not that bad as we thought.we have got some masterpieces over covid 19.thank you SOAD.😍

System Of a Down Siempre será Mi banda favorita que se la enseñaré a todas las generaciones siguientes. Saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪
I still can't quite believe that after 15 years we got new SOAD music
1:20-1:39 Black Metal Riffs part
Keep ON ROCKING SOAD
🤟🤟🤟🤟
The good old SOAD
I looked them up out of curiosity for the first time in years  Than I see they posted a video 8 hours ago. Crazy.
Bravo! THIS IS POWERFUL. 10000% GENIUS.
Wow. Thank you.
The chug at 1:10 hits hella hard
Yes!!! 🤘🤘🤘
System of a down🤘💀🔥
Ну наконец-то 🙌🏻
Never a big fan, but I do dig this tune.  Great production.  BTW, I do love that the band is so politically diverse.  Put out a new album, that will truly be unifying!  SOAD!!!!
Son & seguirán siendo la verga 🔥
man this song slaps so hard
\m/
Genial.... Simplemente la esencia de SOAD
Finnaly somebody back ANTI-WAR metal, i feel really old times
this song is a rip off of down at mcdonaldz
Eh it was okay but I can't help but feel like something is missing, I just feel like they don't have that same edge anymore, and his singing is lacking in aggressive nature. Idk maybe it's just me, but hey good to hear them playing again.

Блять круто же. К чему было распадаться. Одна из культовых групп. Ещё могли бы многих заткнуть за пояс (
I like the other song more
Beautiful!

Easy on the eye liner
Que feo saber que lo hicieron separados, eso le quita poder a la rola, ni siquiera entre ustedes pueden resolver sus problemas y le piden al mundo que cambie, no suena un poco eso hipócrita?
Love soad..... please make more music
YEEEEEEEHAAAAWWWWW this is genuinely the happiest day of my life. MOAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!
Please make more music!!
You guys should take all the profits from your albums these past ten years and donate it to your cause.  Oh thats right
It just sounds like an amalgamation of all their other songs.
Amazing!! So heavy and beautiful at the same time. Love to SOAD
Como sempre quebrando Tudo! Brasil é SOAD!
And right as i get into the music
The 496 dislike is from Turkish people ! Greetings from Greece.

Marcos mion vocalista do soad? Kek
Yo pienso qe esta muy estilo anime porque cono es los que los jovenes ven y son el FUTURO del mundo deben de darse cuenta de lo podrido qe ests el mundo y encontrar una forma de arreglarlo aunque no es trabajo de una sola generacion si no de lo que se transmite y no caer en los mismos errores, por eso mi filosofia es vivir y dejar vivir
Today’s my birthday and you guys are the best. Amazing song.
Blast beats 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Prosecutors are prostitutes from the start......wow is that legit......
OMG!
Close your eyes... and you'll see come the nu metal again.
What the world needs now. SOAD music

Alguien mas los conoce por guitar flash?
Is the purple flower a Rose of Sharon reference?
Fucking awesome
Meh ...
muittoo bommmmm mdssssssss
Mantenere il proprio stile e la propria identità fottendosene delle "mode" questo vuol dire fare musica!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘
💥💥💥
Demais!
Serj, Daron. I have a solution to your ego probelsm. One person writes 5 songs, the other person writes 5 songs, you both get full control over these songs. That way when you realize the song is shit, you can both work on it, and BOOM, problem solved.
o cara do legendarios e vocalista
TAKE MY SOUL
Thanks for this great music video!
We love you SOD 😭❤️ God bless Armenia ❤️💙💛
For fooks sake guys, Serj/ Daron   plz put your Rock Star differences aside and work on an album! This has been hurting the band and the fans for far too long. Come together, life is far too short.
Super
Son  lo mejor S.O.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.D.
Gracias dioses del Rock por reunir por lo menos una vez mas a estos capos
I prefer this one 💞
You NEVER FAILED ME, YOU SAVED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

System para sempre❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍
Obrigado  Soad  ♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷 quase uma vida mais valeu a pena eu e minha esposa adoramos muito ♥️🇧🇷

İt s bullshit
How have I never noticed how beautiful Serj’s eyes are?
2.49 min of pure satisfaction!
System Of A Down are dicks to epyleptics.  I love this.  Thank you!
Now this is the real SOAD
A new song❤
Just a reminder that the only votes that truly count are the ones that your money make.
Are the purple flowers standing for something in the end? (2:41) Is this some kind of showing the poverty in some countries? I mean in Africa are nearly no flowers/points
They are still legends ❤
nice song :)
Sorry but this is not what i expected:(
magic
This about blowing up Palestinians?
Give them money.
Armenia is love!!!
I SOAD back together or is this only a temporary thing?
Great as always. Much love to SOAD and Armenia from Colombia
Esperar por 15 años, y ver que un faro de luz se encendió.. Y después darnos cuenta que solo será esto... Una linda causa, pero una tristeza muy grande... Excelente!
Love for Armenians from me as Indonesian
Chile here!!
- Can you see us? "BI RI NA DA BUM, IN GE NO CI DI NA DA BUM" ♫♪♬😂😂😂😂 É uma competição com a "Chop Suey" concerteza!!!  SOAD FODAAAAAA!!!!🇦🇲🇧🇷
It'd be great if Daron knew he wasn't the lead singer. Miss those days.
SOAD never disappoints us just listen to the lyrics and the message everyone needs to hear
Hot dog! Glad to see you boys!
You guys made something so true and believable damn this is so amazing you guys are legend.
Ansioso por um novo álbum 💿 ✌🏼🙂
How it's looking good, when you, guys are together
I had service on my internet today and this video is what I used to test my new connection.  The tech guy and I were rocking out in my kitchen to some SOAD.
🧡🤘🏽
Perfect !!!
2021 cannot have a better start than with a new video of SOAD!!
Clipe ficou lindo,mas e o álbum novo?lança nunca😔?

1:10 Clave el Infernal que se mandaron

Nice to see daron is still a crackhead
Black metal part is awesome. Greetings from Colombia 🇨🇴🇦🇲
The song, the video...  Totally Amazing! I just love it. It brings me tears of joy to see you making music again, making art, helping people. The world needs System of a Down now more than ever. Thank you!
fake genociders.
Once again! This is my favorite fucking band of all time. I'm so excited for my merch to arrive.
Crazy
Man I love soad, but I can’t stand the bass players voice
Garbage
Guys you need to come back!!!!
Очень крутой и сильный клип. Соответствует песне. Жаль, что поводом для песни и клипа послужили такие печальные события.  Желаю Армении и всему армянскому народу только добра.
Melhor banda!!!!
long live armenia
15 years and still nothing has changed theyre just as good as they used to be
Serj ou Marcos Mion? Kkkk  Mais um vídeo top!
Life is whole again!!
Não e atoa que Amo essa banda só obra de arte ☝️System e Vida
I Love SOAD!
so much cooler than protect the land video. Only bad thing is daron with gibson sg :/
Love soad
SOAD in early 2000s: "my cock is much bigger than yours" SOAD in 2020: "the prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start"  Yep, looks like not much has changed
Good thing we got Trump out of office, so Biden can send troops back to the Middle East, allowing SOAD to make more music.
miss for this so much!!!
Gran gran rola y aún mejor con el vídeo.  Nuevo álbum ya !!! 🤘😎
WAKE UP!!!!!! A renaissance is coming!! grab your instruments!!! LET IT BE YOUR VOICE!!!! START A MUSIC MOVEMENT IN YOUR CITY!!!!!!! THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!!!!!! BREAK THE RULES!!!!!! THE TIME IS NOW!!!!!!!! BEYOND ROCK N ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to hear this live, still got my ticket for May. The wait will be worth it
Daron is such a brilliant writer. I wish the rest of the band would openly acknowledge his writing abilities more.
Só gringo nos comentarios, cade os BR ???
System Of A Down forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we all miss SOAD soooo much
True masterpiece! Well done SOAD!
Amazing, speculating and everything at least led to two singles dropping. Even if they go back on hiatus after it's nice they were all able to work together to make some art they all cared about. A nice moment for the band and all the fans truly. ALSO thank you for using animation in this!!! Loved the black and white contrast.
Fenomenale opera!!
Angry Serj takes me back to THIER first album
It's happening again!
GOOSEBUMPS 😖
Epic, just makes me depressed though that these dudes really can't agree on making more music.. I wonder how their younger selves would feel about some members having to much pride. Its stupid.
I still cant believe that donations are not available in some regions like mine.
This song just reminds me of why I fell in love these guys 15 years ago.
They took how we have felt listening to system for 20 years and put it in a video
BLAST BEATS!?! HOLY FUCK YEAH! What exactly is this song about?!
Ilustree. :V
Eso fue maravilloso
Nice
I really never liked this band or anything I've heard from them at all, but I actually really dug this track.
Nunca imaginei que a banda fosse retornar... E menos ainda que retornaria em um tempo onde todos os shows do mundo estariam suspensos por conta de uma pandemia.   To doida pra viver a fase Com banda/Sem pandemia/Com shows.  Bora florescer como humanidade, pq do jeito que tá não dá mais! We never run from the devil! 🤘🍄
SERJJJJJJJJJJJJ!!! FEELS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN GUYSSSSSSSSSSSSS
🔥 ✊🏾
BRAZIL 🤟🏻🇧🇷
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Not great.
B)
Sg huh? Where is the iceman??
Perfeito demais 🖤🖤

One and only, originators, teachers and guides. SOAD
NOSSA QUE LOUCO PQP
The best band ever!! SOAD is here! Respect from Greece!
O Serj parece o Marcos Mion!!

Thank you for this Anti Genocidal Artwork.
Хуета, переделывайте
Idkw but this sorta gives me some Toxicity feels.
Fuck yeah!!
Dam I thought the livestream was going to be them playing a live set 😞
que perfeição
Ta chida la animación
Está rara, aunque es bueno verlos de nuevo.
I'm still and always will be shocked they returned
soad doesnt rlly tell the pblic what the lyrics are referring too but we all know what this video is about especially where the 429 dislikes came from
Anyone else cried at the end?
Fodalistico 🎸🔥
Ya esta viejito:'(
🎸🔥🎸🔥🎸🔥🎸🔥🎸🔥🎸🔥
i love the animation and the shakiness of the camera omg
𓀁
HERE BEFORE 1 MILLION VIEWS. I LOVE SOAD
Is it just me or does Daron have a crazed look in his eyes throughout this entire video
Хорошая песня)
Excelente ojalá sorprendan con un nuevo álbum pronto ya que tienen muchos años sin publicar uno, sería épico SOAD es una gran banda..😎🖤🔥🎵🎶🇵🇪🤘🏻
Great song, great video!!!👍👍👍 PLEASE SOAD, work out your differences and reunite!!!👍👍👍

My prayers are all I can give to Artsahk, but thanks to you guys I can!  Armenians are some of the toughest people on the planet. They've been given the shit end of the stick for 100 years.  The Poland of the Balkans,  much love and prayers from Canada

Oh man, I love listening to the music of you guys!
Noice
thanks guys for coming back!
The thing that annoys me is that they didn’t write this together because Daron was gonna use it for scars on Broadway, so technically we are still waiting on a soad track.
Now this is the System Of A Down I've been waiting for!
comment and LOVE from INDONESIA.. stay strong SOAD !!!
Շնորհակալ եմ շատ 🙏🇦🇲 Արցախը մերն է 🇦🇲

I am sorry for everyone who lost their lives in this battle.  Maybe Armenia shouldn't have occupied Nagorno-Karabakh in the first place though :/ Then there wouldn't be a war.
Noice
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!! this song been stuck in my head the day it came out.
That face of angry and exotic Serj reminds me like in 2005 with Hypnotize videos

💕🤟🇺🇦
Que buen video e interpretación 20/10 Hicieron felíz a un fan latinoamericano.  SOAD for ever !!!!!
Uau. They must return :)
Fucking awesome!!!
😎😎😎
Me encanto, me encanto, me encanto ✨
it is really fucking good. Music and video. Hard to back with good material after so many years and with fans that after all this time would be hoping for impossible quality to please them. Well, SOAD did this. They managed the ubelivable. Well, war is a best motivation (it's not a con). Respect for SOAD, Armenian Nation, and to all who decilne world order build on agression. Peace
Esplêndido. #StayStrongArmenia. From Brasil.
Ive been listening soad since i was 13, and now is my birthday and they upload a new video 😊 man what a good day, best gift ever 🤟🏼

Was supposed to see them in UK, Download fest in 2020... guess I gotta go with the youtube vids ^.^' hope after all this mess is over, the fans can still have a chance somewhere in EU to see them play live. It's not easy for us folks to travel to the USA for concerts. And they still so goooood man.

Vamoooo por fin tanto tiempo 🤘🤘🤘💥💥💥💥
You still got it! Really cool song, loving the guitar riffs, those are sick, and the vocals are as always on point
Don't like the song it isn't authentic
Thousands of lives lost because Armenia one day decided to occupy a piece of foreign land. What a shame...
Convinced Serj is one of the most talented artists of our generation 💕
ES BELLÍSIMO.
THE WEAPONS OF MASS PERSUASION WOULD LIKE TO THANK SOAD FOR FIGHTING TO CHANGE THE WORLD!!!
Как же круто снова видеть их вместе! Респект. Украина.
It feels like just yesterday it was 2008, I was 3 years old and my mom (who got me into metal) was still heartbroken after the SOAD breakup. For as long I can remember I've been loving System of a Down and I always thought "I'm never going to hear a new SOAD song" because I was born the year their last album came out. Now here I am, 15 years old, long hair, head banging to the band that made me into the person I am today. Now I'm not religious but, thank God for System of a Down and God bless Armenia & Artsakh. 🤘
I personally like this way more than Protect the Land. It's just pure System!
I didn't expect they would make a video but they did.So good to see them do this together❤
Hey guys! Thanks for your music and doing right things
H3LL0N34RTH
Amazing!!! You guys rock 🤘🤘🤘
Serj looks great 👌
Classic SOAD 🔥❤️🤟
Tá foda de mais 🔥🔥👏🏻
System's back baby. Hell yeah !!!,

Vcs são os melhores SOAD 🤟🏻🇦🇲🇧🇷

Beautiful act. Class and inteligence as always. We all love you, keep fighting.

Ooooooohhhhhhhhh
Damn that ending though! 👏👏 2:40
Black metal 1:21
The only good thing about war is SOAD new music
thank you guys for that all you do. It’s a fantastic job  👍
they literally came after 15 years and still they stood loyal to their essence while changing!
Love this track!! And great visuals!! I hope these 2 new latest SOAD tracks are a sign they're gonna be releasing a new album soon!! They haven't missed a beat!
Cant believe they just uploaded, I'm astonished
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥
WELCOME BACK.  MORE........ 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Magnifique ❤️
Oh the energy!!! Yes guys!!! 🤟🏼❤️
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Daron looks like a samurai on coke lol
Fan of soad before, thought they were about justice and all that. When i read "about the fundriser", i knew they are all hypocrites who supported pashinyan to exterminate innocent civilian in Karabagh and would not hesitate to occupy de jure and de facto territory of Azarbaijan then play victim while doing so, no wonder Russia won't help you. The instigator or the bully, armenia, had to walk with tail between their legs after they lost the war and then surrendered. Then cried for attention from people around the world and silly people like kardashian, that's just rubbing salt to the wound. then i lost all the respect and your music become irrelevant knowing that bunch of hyprocrites made the song. i literally stopped the song in 5s reading the description. Better rename your band to Supporter Of A Dictator or whatnot
top
É, meus queridos Br fans...SOAD não perdeu essência
Looks like Slayer, lol
wow that’s insane another great song from soad
I’ve been waiting for this day for 16 years! I’m so happy right now!!! Thank you System of a Down! ❤️
COOL !!!
i feel like this could use a seizure warning
My childhood is SCREAMING
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Glorious
You guys kinda spoiled this before it came out by saying thats its gonna be animated
Okay so finally after long circle our old S.O.A.D is back to track again 🤘🤘🤘
I didn't expected a music video for Genocidal too, i love it
Is heartbreaking the situación in armenia, but it's good to see a great banda doing what they do best, rocking and helping others.
Огонь !!! Надеюсь и альбом будет !
Vamos sistem of a down
❤🤟
Impressão minha ou o Serj tá com a cara do Marcos Mion?  Ótima música, parabéns, queremos um novo disco!
nice ...  Next Song SOAD..  :)
Lithuania supports Armenia 🇱🇹🇦🇲
Great!
We all know that Serj is SOAD’s soul, his voice and style still giving life to the band. Then we have an egomaniac (Daron) a Trump supporter (John) and a neutral dude (Shavo) .
FINALLY SOME GOOOD NEWS IN THIS YEAR. Pls Come back and show us some real music
Braziiiilll
I've grown up listening to soad and there's nothing better than a new song 😍🤩

Gracious sound 🎶🎶
Loved that blast beat at 1:20
Serj you are still a sexy beast 😜
hermoso video saludos desde MÉXICO like si eres de méxico
If I'm honest...I've never been a complete metal fan, but I've always loved SOAD! They are the exception for me! Still going strong...may they continue to make kickass tunes! Respect their stance and love for their country and representing the ongoing plight of Armenia.
This song is the most roots that SOAD could did. Trully masterpiece!
Beautiful, perfect song,the best song of 2021.
Weird ass shit that rocks is a very uncomfortable way that questions seriousness. They still got it.
GIWE WE A NEW FUCKING ALBUM
SOAD's roots right here!
Goosebumps...
i think i love you
do brasil aqui, admirando essa banda, espero que eles voltem logo
I just love these guys so much! One of the most original bands ever. Never can one confuse their music with ANY other. Fantastic!!!!!

Կեցցե՜ք, իմ սիրելի հայեր
Annnnddd occupant armenia lost
When i saw the Armenian dead soldiers caught in the ambush i started crying. When i heard about dead poor civilians i cried. Why was that even necessary? And at TV nobody said nothing and i am from Romania where everything goes at the news. Rest in Peace for all fallen soldiers in the war. I will pray for them.
A banda! O ultimo grito da realidade!
Will there be more songs??
Lyrics:  Can you see us?  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  You, me, us, them  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summoned the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can you see us?  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil Persecution ends now  Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids Teaching warfare to their children The bastards that will be destroyed Guess who's coming over to dinner? The genocidal humanoids  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil  Beating the devil We never run from the devil We never summon the devil We never hide from the devil We never  Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start  Can you see us?

Serj tá a cara do Marcos Mion kkkkkkk
Great work! Love to see you back, guys!
Glad for this new song.

Yes it is a SOAD, pure SOAD
Mexico is always with soad🇲🇽
They still have the SOAD Feeling👊🖤
Fun facts about Second Karabakh War:  More Azerbaijanis who born in Karabakh died in this conflict than Armenians who born there. Majority of the Armenian casualties born in Armenia, most of them were still teenagers..   Armenian forces target more civillian targets with SCUD ballistic missiles especially destroyed an entire neighborhood in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja.  (Civillian casualties on Azerbaijani side: 100 Civillian Killed-400+ Injured / Armenian side: 65 killed 160 injured)

Need more new SOAD, this is great!
Me perdí el nacimiento de mi hijo por este videoclip y no estoy arrepentido
Looking good guys 😁✨

Love and peace goes to the people of armenia. Greetings from Germany ❤️
Aguante System CARAJOO!!!
Nice. Very deep video
YOU LOST
Been waiting so long it feels like for this lol ❤  sending peace and love from Michigan
Song is great, one of the best soad songs in last 10 years. I also love the video, but there should really bs an epilepsy warning.
❤️SOAD
It's funny hearing new System of a Down with a similar message given how outspoken their drummer had been in favor of Trump.
A MESMERIZING SLICE OF A PIZZA PIZZA PIE!!!! SOAD LIVES ON!!
🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾
Gooooooood!!!
Ya me imagino sus conciertos, Serj cantando sin sentimiento jeje
✝️✝️✝️
Cadê os brasileiros??!!!🇧🇷
Those blast beats tho!
Please make a new album !!!!!
Yeghbayrner, I love you guys. I may be a old fart, but I listen often and loud to your tunes. I am proud of you guys vocalising the injustice done to our people. If I understand correctly: "The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start!".............TRUE SHIT!   As a long time fan, I am sad u never saw you live. STAY SAFE AND KEEP ON ROCKING! so I may see you one day.
Pretty meaning >~<
Respect from 🇹🇷  I love you S.O.A.D ✌🏿✌🏿✌🏿  states can fight for their own interests. we peoples should make peace, i love you all.🚩🚩✌🏿✌🏻
This video gives me the Mezmerize/Hypnotize vibes. Hope they release a new album.
Terrorist and corrupted “musicians” trying to fill out their pockets by this was as they are outdated
Superb!!!
my eyes hurt geez, should have a seizure warning or something
Deviam fazer um novo album iam arrecadar bem mais dinheiro do q apenas lançando 2 músicas.
Great, amazing!! System Of A Down forever!!
<3
I LOVEEEE IT 🖤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like it, it's still SOAD, feels like a hypnotize 2.0 and I dig it.
System of a down 🤟🤟🤘🤘🤟🤘🤟🤘🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤘🤟🤟
Artsakh is Armenia, Armenia is Artsakh
Llevaba mucho sin ver tanto énfasis en SOAD 😭😭
What an amazing video. When the kid pulled out the slingshot and the fast part started playing again - what a well written concept. United we stand! #ArmeniaStrong
Amei
Make Serj Growl Again it's the slogan
FFFUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHKKK  YEAHHH!
This is my favourite of the two new songs that released as it reminds me of their earlier works. Great video too.
Thanks for an amazing video and song! SOAD forever ❤️

SOAD was the most unique of the "nu metal bands" back in the day, hope they make a new album soon. Always my favorite band.
AGUANTE SOAD VIEJAAAA!!!
beautiful, meaningful. Your music speaks!
1:10 Jesus, just imagine that part played live
We need a new disc please!!!
Pela aparência deles, vemos q o tempo passou. Mas não perderam a essência. Parece q reataram a conexão entre eles
Yo're the best group ever!!!
Su esencia musical sigue siendo la misma ♥️
Hell yeah
опять это пучеглазый тюрок!
Increíble. Me gustó mucho. Me encanta verlos reunidos otra vez.
Brutal🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
15 years of breake, and i dont see any change.  Others bands are changing from metal to pop/rap with sythezators after so much break. But not they, not they.
You guys are awesome! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
#SystemOfADownIsBack
Fuck yeah
I had an epileptic seizure

Thank you SOAD
люблю вас вже 20 років! With love from Ukraine!

Anyone else noticed how the very end of the music video became a whole T-mobile commercial??
SOAD, газуйте!!! Ну что за огнище!!!  🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
CADE OS BRAZUCAS HAHAHA 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷   SYSTEM OF A DOWN O/
Well that was generic af.
When its about terrorism in mind armenia.What do you expect from country that national hero is facist.(nacist)(i am about njdeh)And if you want facts. Google it and tou will find info that he was judged by Soviet Russia as a war criminal.
Lmao, so ironic to write a song about yourselves
I think people should look at System of a Down as the paradigm for how polar opposites can come together to make something positive: 3/4ths card carrying socialist and one raging right winger. do make an A league band.
Это просто круто!
Woow 🔥
After 20 years, they still can't make a bad song. THEY NEED TO COME BACK.
Sorry, I'm too poor for the fund raiser.
omg this is so good i cried

ну все я альбом теперь хочу
Amazing video 🔥🤘🏻🍻
Мощно
STRONG  B.Y.O.B  VIBES FROM THIS VIDEO!  <3  GOOD OL' SOAD <3  🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
Armenians used to make fun of and judge anyone who listened to metal let alone rock. Suddenly were all proud to be Armenian and "always accepted this kind of music all along". From an Armenian, believe me...not true.
Muy buena cancion, dios mioo, esta de locos💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥❤
I want to thank everyone who donated and still donates in the name of all Armenians❤️🇦🇲
YEEEESSSSS
That was THRASH!
Я то-то пропустил или SOAD опять подняли звуковую индустрию с колен ?
Muito foda mano, impossível descrever o tanto que eu amo essa banda. Yeah 🤘 🇧🇷🇧🇷
🇬🇧
Brabo, um hino
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
eitaaaaaaaaaaa👊🖤🇧🇷
Wow, perfect animation and perfect song 🤟
Awesome 🤘🤘
Thank you soad , and much obliged.
Love this and protect the land both awesome songs!!! Also wicked video love it!!! System of a down rocks. PLEASE KEEP MAKING NEW MUSIC US YOUR FANS REALLY MISS YOU GUYS!!!
Ok I cannot fault their fundraising at all and fair play for doing what they are for the sake of those less fortunate is amazing, However.....  Anyone who thinks system is a united group is kidding themselves. Did no one notice there wasn't one shot of the whole band in that video. It was all individual camera shots. I am confident they weren't filmed together. I mean come on guys!!! The irony is You want people to stand up as one but you cant even shoot a video as one. Oh and you cant even do a live stream as one (where the f was daron??)   Fair play for the fundraising, it's amazing,  but I'm not buying this system is back b.s.
♥️☮️🕊️
El año acaba de mejorar con esto
They're back!!!
Serj with the leather jacket and grey beard looks even more bad ass then he ever did.
Reminds me of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Amazing. Love it. 🇦🇲🇦🇲💪💪
👍❤❤❤
Proud to be ARMENIAN🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲.  RESPECT SOAD
Love to SOAD and Armenia..keep strong . Love from India.
Nostalgia 🙌
WE NEED ONE FINAL ALBUM PLEASE 🙌
❤️🇦🇲
Hypocrites!!!
Просто отцы !!! Миллион лайков !хочется ещё  полноценного альбома от них очень !
This was a bit unexpected! But great content nonetheless SOAD, hopefully there is some new content from you guys in the future 😁
Pls epilepsy warning next time. I`m glad that you alive.
System of a blast beat!?!?!? This is dope 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Margarita Simonyan with her husband Tigran Keosayan, Armenians, who are the heads of Russian propaganda, daily arrived in the Ukrainian Donetsk occupied by Russia. And they openly declared that they, Russia, want to occupy all of Ukraine. Ukrainians don't exist for them. What do you think about it?
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲 peace for Armenia ♡
nicee!
They are back finally!
Jejak
nobody talking about the guyliner?
И как это понимать?
❤️❤️❤️
Serj aged well
Hell yea

It´s sad that most media (at least in my country) do not inform about this War or its aftermath.. it´s like no one cares anymore :(
Happy to see a new videoclip of System of a Down.  Sad by the need to talk about some types of issues.

i was shocked to hear John Dolmayan on the livestream earlier saying they should "take a cue from israel" really.? does he not know what is happening to the Palestinian people being genocided by israel and more land theft...:( i comment here because live chat and comments are dissabled on that stream.
Artsakh strong ✊🇦🇲

Please keep making music, these new songs slap so hard. I know it's not easy but please put the egos aside and get a new album out.

Soad already saved my 2021 <3
Serj 👑👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
They still got it!!!
We need a new album, put your differences aside and give more people a reason to support your fund raising. You guys are just awesome people
It's a shame I can't watch this because of those awful light effects every music video seems to have rn :(, a warning on the description would have been nice 😅 but I enjoyed what I could watch .Besides that very excited about them playing together and about the new music and interested on the message they're sending.
Serj esta parecendo o Marcos Mion
YAAAAASSSS 🤘
Simply EPIC
Love this metal !! All the way from Frankton New Zealand
Continuam monstros, minha banda favorita.!
THAT'S the music! awesome. love from Iran.
Badass Song, Beautiful Video...great job boys
Друже - быть. Или....
🤟
Why the fuck people dislike video even they did not see? That's make me furious!
System Of A Down is back in a downed system? cool
We really needed this music video <3 love from Beirut
Foda demais ✊🏽
Here are some critical views:  I love the song but didn't like the video as I had much higher expectations on that one. You make the sound of weapons but show yourself during that, and where are the genocidal humanoids you are singing about? I only see some kind of dementors there. Sorry guys, I'm a big fan, but you are able to do so much better videos, especially making so much excitement about it.  P.S. We feel like you Daron take over Serj too much now. Hold up, man.  Anyway, thanks for everything! Your message is heard!
🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
ARMENIA WILL RISE AGAIN
Nmms serj se ve refachero ya me hacia falta verlos en nuevo contenido los amo
Cool but fuck, my head hurts
Ну такое... Левацкое.

F********K YEAH!
Amo 😍
This world has gone crazy spreading individualizm and self-distingiushing. This band is in trends due to this crazyness and this is a sickness rather than culture, creativity or else. Like it says in Wiplash, if can't play jazz, go to rock ))
STUNNING
Porfavor  graven  otro Album Salvarían a la humanidad   System  of a down 🤘🎸
Bom demais
Serj looks like Uncle Monty from a series of unfortunate events 👌

O serj tá parecido com o Marcos Mion kkkkkk
Excellent work🤘 Edit: I’d actually been wanting to see what a music video for Genocidal Humanoidz would look like since it was first released and this made a great birthday gift. It was really inspirational. God bless the soldiers, your work to bring and help spread awareness, and God bless Armenia along with the people. Thanks for the new music, the music videos, and being SOAD🤘 (Donated in November 2020)
Thats some deadly riff...!!  😮😮🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼

Good video!! System of a down should make a new album
pretty awesome..in fanct ..representative of the Armenian Genocide (with love and total respect from Greece)
This is amazing I love SOAD so much, this is literally a masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥
<3 amazing
Great video!
Porfavor,soad en tendencias,me cere este video 500 veces si hace falta
Awesome
Evrybody need !+!!!!!!!!!!
I love this so much! S.O.A.D releases their first songs in 15 years and , imo, genocidal humanoidz is one of their best songs ever. It's a shame the circumstances that led to their release are sad.
"prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start"    Kamala Harris
They made a comeback and it’s intensely beautiful ! This video concept is amazing too!
Einfach nur geil das System wieder Musik macht!!!!
Daron 🎸👊
A masterpiece, as always.

I'm 54 and this kicks ass
SYSTEM OF A DOWN never stops being fabulous, I didn't hope less from it, I'm completely amazed by this sacred video which reflects the real violence problema that occurs in Armenia, we never leave this project named Genocidal Humanoidz; it demonstrates the demons which exist inside us when there is a montrosity against our security. I, you, he, she, it, we, they are fortunate to have the opportunity to watch this treasure on YouTube. Like if you are for System Of A Down and its cause.
Stay strong Armenia from France 🇫🇷🤝🇦🇲
FREE ARMENIA People just like the Armenians need help everyday.   From abused children in America to abused nations and people like the Armenians. The US will not do anything because people vote based on parties who pander to the corrupt abusive nations. People still buy Iphones. Apple gets their product made at a place in china they had to put nets around to keep people from killing themselves and force them back to work. Armenians fight to live and neither the right or left, Repub or Democrat give a damn. When you vote for people who run for office because they want to do it,  just like dems and repubs, you get what we have today in America. It is sad to think as big and powerful as America is we will not help a nation being taken over brutally or a child who is beaten by his mother. Would I run for office? yes. Would I want to do it? Hell no!!! True leaders died a long time ago. We traded 1 tyrant 3000 miles away for 3000000 tyrants 1 mile away. Help the weak needy.  FREE ARMENIA
Where is the place on a map ?
AMO A SOAD
карта в конце такое себе
A band playing a similar music genre from Poland, I recommend  https://youtu.be/qHtWnOtzVCM
No man Africa is not that bad !
Nice clip, but not for epileptics...

We will liberate our lands once and for all. 🇦🇲

Thanks Soad ❤️🇧🇷
Grande system
Ver o system junto de novo me trás uma coisa tão boa.
Шикарно <3
today is my second birthday because they are back !!! they are like Tony Stark They create new and better things in the world of music, they are like superheroes in the world of music and in our world. They are like a breath of fresh air, like the truth that we miss so much. They sing for us about us about those problems and feelings that someone does not see, but they exist and they need to be corrected.
Aí sim🤟🏽
Su fan por siempreeeee
Needless to say. This is very cool.
FUCKEN LOVE YOU GUYS 😭🔥🔥🔥 such intensity such passion such unmatched energy.  same soad. different day 💙💙💙 i'm sitting here speechless after seeing the video
11/10, would watch again.

System né papai
I am proud of being Armenian and proud of having such people like SOAD members🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲 Thank u all,around the world,who support Armenia and Armenian's 🖤
El gordo procastinador d' "el canal de amusia" dijo que el tema era malo y que nisiquiera se podian soprtar en una habitacion los 4, Y esto que es?? En tu cara!

Amazing Birthday present. Thanks SOAD
These guys are our national pride 🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲 So proud of you 🥲
Can't thank SOAD members enough for their support and contributions to Artsakh. And this all would mean nothing without their international fans. My people thank you all.
good video System Of A Down 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Son lo mejor de mi vidaaaa
exellent motion design. lifting feeling. Power to armenia, thank you for doing this !
good job guys
devil!!!!
Awesome!
Очень сильная песня....
Давайте в тренды опять закинем)
Aaaaaaa😍🇧🇷
We need a new album
An all-time classic band with a very timely song. I guess Ilham can't pay a world-renowned band to justify his atrocious actions. It has to come from people.
поскольку в моей стране пока нельзя делать пожертвования.  Единственное что я могу только поддержать правильность выбора темы.  О проблемах в обществе нужно говорить иначе где тогда хвалебная "Свобода Слова"?  Большой респект System Of A Down за то что еще открывают людям глаза на суровую действительность  и несправедливость в мире! В этом плане мой канал очень их поддерживает! В плане обращения к социуму и общественному мнению в целом! Все мы люди, все мы хотим мира, все мы хотим правды! наверное лучшее что я сейчас могу сделать это посмотреть этот ролик еще раз!
Let's Go System of a Down 😍
Yes Cmon system, next is an album now , you can add these tracks on there for all I care just please a full body of work 🙏😭🙏
If you listen to the music of this band, you automatically became my friend, Soad Forever 🤘🇦🇲
THE BOYS ARE BACK AT IT AGAIN!
soad top
Приветствия с Казахстана✌️
Wow SOAD 💖
This, honestly sounds and looks amazing ! Love from France !
I'm surprised I didn't get a seizure from this
That kid's a beast for taking on those demons with a slingshot
Os melhores que existem 🇧🇷❤
love you System Of A Down
🤘🔥🌸🔥🤘
Fuck the system//// maravilhosos
Бля ахуенно. Спасибо за то что вы вернулись)))
simples e foda. adorei esse clipe, tem uma ótima mensagem. e essa msc gritava pra ter um clipe kkkkkkk 🖤🤘
You are heroes guys! What you do for Armenia and Artsakh is amazing! Sending love to you from Russia and from all of armenians here🥰❤️ I hope you and Armenia Fund together raise enough to help our wounded soldiers❤️❤️❤️ And yes, both song and the video are wonderful!
Omg!😱😍
Hi from Armenia❤️💙🧡
👍🏿
May we see text?
If there's a new album, should be called _Armenia_ ✊
this is SO cool, I have no words! շնորհակալություն
C'mon guys. Stop this drama nonsense and make another album.
amazing guys
Gran fan de México 🇲🇽👍
Perfect! Great videoclipe! SOAD is alive! #SaveArmenia ♡
I loved the animation. Such an amazing job, this song has a powerful meaning behind it. 🇦🇲🙏🏻❤️
Beautiful.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Missed this
the musicc is so good man
Wow!
Brutal
keren banget animasinya om... keep strong!!!
MOAR! TOO SHORT!
anyone going back to rewatch PROTECT THE LAND
👏
Amazing!!! Best band of the entire world
Buenardo!
Yeah!!
As an armenian i'd say it didn't work as SOAD have  showed us in the video.  The only answer for this war is the international unity of workers of both sides of conflict, just because every side's is to blame, no peoople need war. Capitalism wants u to fight for the "national" interest.
The Best sistem
Great song, classic SOAD. The video is great, the boy with the slingshot represents so well the balance of power in this unfair conflict. Thanks, SOAD. Your work is immeasurable.🤘 ☮  🤘 🎸🎸🎸

1:20 that black metal part
I really missed you, guys :(
I feel like they still have a lot of potential to be weird and even put out a lot of energy. This video reminds me of older-school System. Wish they would incorporate that style into more of their recent live performances.
Animo armenia
S.O.A.D is Back!
I love you so much ❤️ Hello from Georgia 🇬🇪

Omg I love it so much! And the ending... so symbolic 😊✊🏼
Aguante SOAD CTM 😎👌🏻
Amo demais, não erram nunca :')
The animation was so good representing the genocidal humanoidz with that ghost like demon creature and then the kid and all the people representing the armenian diaspora and the supporters. So well done.

I love it
new song is awesome
My name is Mariam and I am a filmmaker from Artsakh. I and my colleague Tigran are making a no-commentary-style documentary series to show post-war life in Artsakh called #TheDesireToLive. These short series are going to show the effects of the war on the regular people of Artsakh and their livelihood. If you want to learn more about Artsakh and the people that live in it, subscribe to the channel! https://youtu.be/aiPHga1iKgw
Photography is amazing!
im sorry,  but serj's voice sounds like squidward...
Si le saben 👍❤️
♥️♥️♥️♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
New album please
Humanoids is the Key Word Here. Very Similar yet, NOT.
Holy fkn WOW!! 🤘 Been waiting a decade and a half for that!  Only took a new round of genocide to make it happen. 😥 Please come to Denver.
Don't ask about a new album, this is not just about S.O.A.D, this is about sending a message smh
Cheguei cedo até
Serj and Daron's voices complimenting each other. Shavo looking like he's having a good time. John looking deadpan.  For a moment, all was right with the world again.
Ну хрен его знает, сомнительный сингл: с одной стороны какая-то высшая идея заложена в него, а с другой... 6 строк текста? Вы серьезно?
Чтобы SOAD писали новые песни, нужно всего лишь натощак...           ...устроить войну в Нагорном Карабахе
SOAD never gets old, never gets irrelevant. Love you guys from Brazil ❤️🇧🇷
Can you see the haunting presence... Oh wait, wrong song
I had to leave that livestream because it almost made me cry, and If the covid is over, and if I have the money, I would visit Armenia...I just wanna say, you guys are talented.
We must learn from the past to create a better future🇦🇲🇹🇷🇦🇿❤
What lit song my 13 year old sent this too me he lives soad.
I was so happy to see you guys playing a new song together. I had so much joy that I was laughing and almost crying! 😭 That being said, I would still give it back if it meant that none of this would be happening in Artsakh!
наконец то !!!
Hell yeah. That animation is sick.
Thank you, System of a Down
Легенды! Крутой трек! Слушая их хочется взять электро-гитару и фигачить вместе с ними... Жаль её нет, да и играть толком не научился еще(
Amazing
Loving the heaviness and blast beats in this song! Great to have you guys back! :) Great fundraising event you had today!

System Of A Down still sounds like System Of A Down, even after so many years of making songs, Serj is like 53 years old and he still sounds better than ever
The animation is sick ngl
Puto arte!!!!!! 🤏🕶😦
I missed your beautiful music 😍🎶
Они клип такой сделали чтобы у тех с кем армяне воюют случилась эпилепсия ? Я конечно ничего против них не имею, но они меня победили. Даже предупреждения вообще никакого не было, мне такое вообще больно смотреть.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ;O Konkretny Rozpierdol!

Nem acredito que Eu vivi tempo suficiente pra ver eles lançarem algo novo
Well that was amazing
Only thing that’s changed since 2005 is Serj’s beard
Serj’s grey beard makes him look sick. Such an intense video.
My quarantine📉📉📉📉📉📉📉
Very thankful to see the band back for a good cause.
Wow oh wow man great song great band . Thanks system of the down for always keeping it 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 let's go

We need a new album. At least a last one. Do it for us.
We want a virtual concert!!!

Absolutely incredible video. Let's bring the warfare to an end.  These legends return to bring awareness. It's very exciting to see artists use their platform to bring awareness to these issues.
La cancion es genocidal humanoiz pero el # es #ProtectTheLand,osea,la otra cancion pero ¿pprque poner el # de la otra cancion y no de esta? Acaso es el nombre de su nuevo disco? Yo ahí lo dijo...

Who is still waiting?!?! 🙏🏼
How did 42 people dislike this without even watching it? Man, they mad.
system of a down <3
Oh my gosh only seen this 39 minutes ago but I can't wait. Eeeeeeeeeeeee
It's so terrifying  that we wouldn't have any idea about what happened, if Armenians didn't spread the info! International media are criminally silent!
🇧🇷🇧🇷
Waiiit
¡Qué grandes!
Hey guys, if you can please donate. Every little things helps.
Trump, literally brokering world peace The establishment: "Enough of that shit. Time to steal an election and squeeze the little guy from some stocks." Soad: "Saddle up, boys. We have a machine to fight again."
Are they not going to get back together? Look at the impact they’ve had from just two songs. The amount of money raised. If only they could settle their difference and come together to keep impacting the world in a positive manner.
LOVE FROMMGERMANY EUROPE.  WISH I HAD MONEY TO GIVE  PLEAEE EVERYBIDY SUPPORT THIS  ANTI HUMAN GOUVERMENTS ON THIS PLANET ARE ABOHT TO FALL SOON TIGETHER AITH GREAT FIREWALLS AND POISNOUS FOOD...  TRIBVTES AND LOVE TO ALL COURAGES HUMANITY HELPING SOULS OUT THERE.  Soad

Who tuned into the live stream expecting to see them play live?
Fuck, good morning

Ola estoy esperando 😼
wowwww
OMG WE ARE WAITING!!!!!!
Does anyone know why Daron isn't on the stream?
Can't wait for this video
a song about bolsonaro
DEBEMOS HACER QUE SOAD ESTE EN TENDENCIA ASÍ QUE DEBEMOS DARLE CLICK AL VIDEO CADA MEDIA HORA Y USAR EL HASHTAG  #SystemOfADownIsBack
ONLY SCREAMING MUSIC WILL WIN THE WAR
I had to unfollow & stop listening on this band since the drummer is a Trump supporter. If they kick him & get a new drummer & thenother band members come out & speak say it wrong to support a racist Trumpster then I'll come back.
I didn't think I was going to live to see new system songs, much less official song videos. Many forces for the Armenians for this very difficult moment, even more so when they censor their truth, I despise the best and may that soon end. Uruguay is with you in this.
H Y P E 💚
THE WHOLE WORLD LET'S HEAR THE CALL FOR PEACE
why so serious..??
Épico
This song will be awesome!
