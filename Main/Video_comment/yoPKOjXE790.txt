Atlanta is beautiful lmfao. 😂
Columbus Crew are in the American Midwest like your West Midlands. Having you here would be a belter!!  Love the pod, mate.
Is it public info what the wage ask was from Ben? Cheers and Happy New Year
Can I have a signed pair of gloves, a shirt or a pair of boots for my Son please Ben ?   Lifelong Fizzy fan btw  !!
OH MY GOD!! My team, Atlanta United was interested in you??? I was really really hoping at the time when Brad Guzan got hurt they would call you🥹 unbelievable how they actually manage to reach out to you & considered even playing for us!! Much love Ben 🥹💕
I am so confused about 2 things:  1. You say you couldn’t move to Newcastle because it’s too far. But you would consider to moving to another country like the USA??  2.  If your retired , can a club actually still seek you out ?
Orlando Pirates vs Kaizer Chiefs (South Africa) - 90k plus fans in the stadium
Well done Ben. Left RCW at a young age and had an amazing career playing for great clubs. Love your reason for saying no to Newcastle….. had the career most people dream off but not without sacrifice and hard work. Family time Now and running your own show and fully in control…… your also very good at this and clearly well respected. Hats off and looking forward to the Billy Hollywood podcast 😀
What a guy fozzy family fist. Would flying there and back in a chopper or private plane not of been an option or do u feel like it was part of you that was ready to retire and concentrate on family and your channel! Glad you didn't go though more content for us viewers
I understand but I hope you join the A League in Australia
go to west brom wolves
That was brilliant
You have to go to the next old firm game (Celtic vs the rangers).  Also it has to be at parkhead
schalke Dortmond
Good luck Ben, absolute legend, enjoy your retirement. I've been told that Steaua Bucharest v Rapid Bucharest is meant to be crazy.
As much I would of liked to have you I completely respect your decision. But how can you consider the MLS if we're to far from the family!? 🤣 Little weird.
You’ve got to come to goodison to watch up play the Liverpool, it’s off the scale
As an Atlanta United fan and Atlanta native, we missed out big !! All the best, Ben!   Love from ATL 🍑
Newcastle are not winning the epl in 3-4 years. There are other rich clubs, and only so many great players on offer. Man U, man c, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, etc are not sitting back idle. All the best in your retirement, however
Legend foz leaving £3m on the table saying no to that deal.
Noo😢😢❤❤ he’s a bloody legend
Old firm at ibrox  Ps just wait till we start to hit form plz and go to a European game at ibrox aswel you won't experience anything like it
Boooooo
That vlog sounds amazing can’t wait to watch!!!
The Atlanta move would have been interesting from a channel point of view and viewers learning about the different culture
Part I don't understand is why is uprooting family to go to Newcastle such a big ask, whereas Atlanta seems all of a sudden doable?
Loved this episode!!!! would love fossy at Arsenal for Rambo back up
End of an era and is fantastic to see someone not just following money. Just demonstrates what a top guy Fozzy is.  RESPECT
Great work Fozzy, football isn't always everything...but family is....you need to get in goal on Soccer AM though
How have Leicester not put in an offer? You’d start 100% over Ward and it would be close to where you live too.
Where do I get one of those league table wall charts?
We all want to know how much they offered 👎
Ben doesnt know he already move into the next phase in football.. his more at piece doing podcast and talking about football..
I think you have had a career we would all bite a dog's bollocks off to have had. You are rich, famous, well-loved, successful and still in the ascendancy in your media career. You have basically completed all the side quests. Your life is your own, and you've managed it impeccably. The decision is no one's but yours. Do what you feel is right. Congratulations on a superb career and all the best for the future.
Go to Roma - Lazio!
Fozzy Leicester needs you! But as your Midlands and retired what about get into GK coaching ❤️👍
Respect 👍🏾
2 whole weeks in Barbados? Sounds a bit excessive
Do Partizan Belgrade - Red Star Belgrade
Think you done right turning down Newcastle for personal reasons...however think you've made a mistake retiring, still a top class keeper in my opinion
Fly the bumblebee to the Qatar mate!
Good long term point about moving but slight contradiction on the travel and staying away for too long when he;s off campervanning... hmmmm
What a legend, happy retirement. Gotta say lads I’d love a hospitality review when you go to these games. Trying local beers and food as well. Making it also like a helpful review. Congrats Ben, cheers
to honest,  Ben vlog as a Newcastle goalie would be amazing, and who knows perhaps going for continental tournament next season, but respect Ben decisions, good luck mate !!
From a selfish point of view I’m sure people will agree it would have been great to see the Newcastle move but got to respect the decision 👍
Newcastle fan here, totally respect your decision would have liked to see you between those posts at St James. ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
AIK-Djurgården
https://youtube.com/shorts/oQR_oAYssSs?feature=share
Lech Poznan - Legia Warszawa
Fantastic podcast and even better football fillin.....amazing to see all the background of contract negotiation and what is in professional footbaler mind.....brilliant....happy retirement enjoy 👊👊👊
You should go to games involving all of your old teams. I would love to see you at a Stoke City match.
Love your videos, top bloke! Always looked up to you back in the day when School football was my life!   Gutted you didn't sign for the toon though! Good luck in the next chapter of your life Ben.
I'm so excited for your next chapter.
Congratulations on your retirement Ben! Thank you for sharing the last few years of your career with us!  Wishing you the best for whatever you go on to do!
You have to Watch a Benfica game against Sporting or Porto
Sad to see you go, but hopeful for your future
Sad to see u retire another leg gone see u on the 24th
If you don't need to do it why move away from your family, 100 percent agree. But stop praising them to the rafters, to say they are possibly going to be world wide is a push. The have not got that pull
Good luck in the future Ben! Very sad I never got a chance to see you play and too just talk to you
Boca Vs riverplate would be incredible
You should go for the manager spot at Watford mate the way you control the back 4 and the rest of the 11 on the pitch at Watford you’d think you were already like a player/manager
The end of an era  So long Fossie
Good luck Ben!
Big YES to River Plate v Boca!  While you're in South America you should pop over to Brazil and watch Flamingo v Fluminese in the Maracana.  That'd probably be pretty special.
Nah Ben don’t go to Atlanta, you’d be playing on a turf field every home game
Ben needs to get involved in the Sidemen charity football match!!
Right decision Ben congrats mate on a wonderful career and life's too short mate you got to now go and do what you want to do and let's face it your missus still wont miss you on a Saturday afternoon😂I have only known you more from the vlogs and you know sometimes when you hear the phrase "In a world where you can be anything BE KIND thats you to a tee mate 100% top fella!
Come to the Portuguese league
They downgraded the cycling GK on fifa 22 in a recent update from 78 to 77 overall.
Should team up with ‘the padded seat’ on insta. All sorts of stadiums and sports 👌🏽
Please come to la galaxy
You’ve gotta go to Besiktas vs Fenerbahce At Besiktas
I met Richard Lee in the early 2000s at a goalkeeping training camp. He was Watford number 1 at the time. We had a great chat whilst grabbing lunch in the canteen. Could you get him on as a guest for one of your podcasts? Would be great to hear about his life after playing football.
BEN PLEASE SEPERATE YOUR PODS INTO SEGMENTS SO WE CAN SKIP TO THE PARTS WE WANT TO LISTEN I ONLY GOT LITERALLY 20 MINS FREE TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT MATE🙏
Cant believe Ben give up playing career for podcasts
Gutted would have loved you at arsenal as nber 2
Good luck on retirement Ben hopefully we might see you and some other gk’s become 1:1 goalie coaches privately
Up the Fozcast
Up the Fozcast
Where is the retro top from?
Enjoy player
Plymouth vs Exeter
Rangers Vs Celtic undoubtedly Ben, next one is January 2nd at Ibrox
WBA are so stupid for not signing you! As a WBA fan, I'd have you back to finish your career off. We love you and will always be a WBA Legend 💙🤍
Newcastle Jets vs Central Coast Mariners
Great pod lads! Well done on a career Fozz from a 2nd year football fan in New Zealand..  Fozzy, Real Betis, just for the pre game show and a bit of europa action ..
People in the military do that for £30k a year
Kaiser Chiefs vs Orlando Pirates in South Africa. Marseille vs PSG Porto vs Benfica Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce  All the best with your retirement Foz.
So refreshing listening to the thought process of any potential transfer. You would’ve loved it up here but a lot of respect for your final decision. Good luck in retirement and with your CGK project.
Ben foster what a legend , great podcast. Up the fozcast
All the best Ben! Great career and I know this next part will be equally great! (Although we'd love to have you in the MLS haha!)
good bye foster you were best goalkeeper
9 months away - is nothing - I think you’ll regret this imagine the buzz around Newcastle atm   Little Indian summer would of been a great way to wrap it up 😮
Boca - River and Betis - FC Sevilla....
all the best with retirement ben! top bloke!
You need to have tubes with you at the games you go ... he is a ledge .. love him on the  fozz  cast he's so down to earth .  Amazing see tubes  with you guys all together he's a perfect fit we all grew  up with foster and tubes
ben make sure your in the celtic end for the old firm 🍀
Derby Nottingham
Total Respect For You Ben For Not Just Taking The Offer Just For The Pay Packet When Your Hearts Not Really In It Anymore. Love The Podcast And Love Your Honesty And Insight Into The Footballing World That We Don't Normally Get To See Or Hear.. Keep Up The Good Work 👏🏼
Go to the Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle at New year's🇱🇻🇱🇻

You have to go to Feyenoord - Ajax played in the legendary De Kuip. Unreal scenes
https://youtu.be/LjtqPFdMVVo. 🤣
Slavia Prague vs Sparta Prague
Tubes role in the interview is so underrated
I don't think anyone can say Ben has made the wrong decision, he's made the decision that makes him happiest and that's What's best. Fair credit Ben, enjoy retirement, you'll always be remembered as a top level keeper lad 👏👏👏💙
psg vs om is always a great game
Congrats on retirement what a career youve had! Should do a Fozcast flashback on all the best moments in your career
Is this podcast on iTunes as I can’t seem to find it
What a class act, Fozzy! I will miss your matchday vlogs, but look forward to watching your other content. As a suggestion, to take or leave as you like, I think a series of keeper training videos would be world class. I know my daughter and I would watch them all day! Thank you for a great career and for being such a genuinely nice guy.
Legend mate hashtag United are waiting 🤘
You mention you want to do the biggest derbys in Europe, you cannot get bigger than Hereford vs Kidderminster oooohh Fozzzy you ledge mate
Albion Legend.
Well done mate
Biggest Derby in the world is obviously Derby vs Forest!!
waiting for the next video
The sound is a nightmare on these videos! Set the volume for this and then have to listen to the adverts blasting 👎🏻
Ha Ha. He's bigging Newcastle up, but secretly their offer (which is what he wanted) they matched Ben Foster was so traumatised by the fact Newcastle wanted him, it forces him into retirement! 🤣🤣 He didn't want to say no as he's clearly a nice guy having listened to many almost all the podcasts so he had some outrageous demands they even met! As he was hoping they would just say forget it. Quality. Love it... (im obviously joking.... but im putting my spin on it as im a Sunderland fan supporting a league one team punching it in the championship!) All the best team Foster.
What no why Ben please don’t
Would you be able to go to India for a match of Kerala Blasters? The atmosphere of the yellow army in the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi is amazing, if you'd look into it.  Anyway great career. Looking forward to more YT content. Love you mate. <3
Would like to see a video on how a footballers life is after a career such as financial income as we all know football pays a lot
Good luck in your retirement Ben, Top player and a top man. Good luck to you
Is it time for hashtag?
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.   (James 3:6) - Repent. Jesus Christ, the Lord of Judgment, is coming soon.
My goodness, I really wanted to see you sign for team. And now you drop the bomb💣.... damn I am sad.  Thank You so much Sir, God's Blessings and Love to You and your family.
Nottingham Forest Vs Derby County!
Nottingham Forest Vs Leeds!
Nottingham Forest Vs Liverpool!
Legia Warsaw vs Lech Poznań in Poland
I am shocked with retirement announcement as fozzy had said he still feels raring to go last week!But good luck with  the decision  and looking forward  for more insightful  shows!Also, atlanta is a cool city,  been there!
As a Newcastle fan you've completely earned the right to put your family first.  Good luck in retirement 👍
He is still a legend in my eyes and I think he could have kept going till 55 he is a prime example of never giving up and putting in all the work necessary to stay at the highest level
Old Firm Biggest by Far - followed by River Boca
Excited for the campervan road trips foz. Enjoy your semi retirement
I’m sad but happy for him at the same time
I promise you Newcastle United are not going to be winning Premier League titles within 3-4 years.
AIK vs Djurgården in Sweden
You have to do river plate and boca. Never will you experience anything like 👍
Congratulations on your career.  Congratulations on the future.  Family is everything.  Stay safe Family first
There's no words to decribe the disapointment that the announcement wasn't Ballon Dawson was on the pod!
Enjoy retirement Ben! I’ll always remember Argyle in the FA cup quarter final in 2007 and you lot won 1-0, you were phenomenal that day.
Hope the match day road trip vlogs are 30min+, but you guys know the analytics better then me!
Old firm…one condition rangers end
Would have loved to see you up Newcastle as you're a brilliant lad and I love your content, but you can't argue with the points you've made. All the best in your retirement, fingers crossed you get to the MLS.
You've got to go to Feyenoord v Ajax, biggest rivalry in the Netherlands
Mate 1 year only should have gone for it. You could have played against Man U and saved a Ronaldo penalty: ). Respect the decision though! All the best for the future
Friggin legend
Time for Hashtag United!!!!
Top keeper,top bloke,wish you'd been at the Wednesday,enjoy your retirement,love the videos,you should replace Lineker on MOTD
could you upload a podcast every day? i just can’t get enough of it
Happy retirement Ben, true premier league legend!
First time watching this, really enjoyed, just wondering who the other two guys are?
@ben - will u do sky sports / BT sport punditry ??
Gotta respect it, Ben is the definition of family before money✅💯
Good luck Ben...best of wishes in your next stage of life
Ben, top career, thanks for the memories at United especially winning the Carling Cup with Utd! Even better you’ve announced this in a Utd shirt! Good luck with the media work! 🇾🇪
congrats on a great career!
Only the real ones watched the pre posted vid
Betis - Sevilla
Haha tubes "please let me come to that one". Big fan. Happy retirement
Time for hashtag now then 👀
Ben, top career fella and I hope your post football aims and or dreams come true.
All the best Fozzy.  The podcast is “an absolute belter mate”  You gotta do the right thing, and by the sounds of it you have pal.
Top man Fozzy! Made the right decision for you and your family! All the best in retirement mate! #upthefozcast
Thank You Fozzy for everything. Even as a non footballer u made me think I was and could be and even though I've never met I wish I will one day cos you are honestly one of the nicest people   Enjoy your time out
So refreshing to hear someone talk about this so honestly! All the best for your retirement! And if you chose to come to Germany for a game, I know Bayern vs. Dortmund are the bigger names but Schalke vs Dortmund is actually the bigger derby! Have fun on your trips!
Happy retirement. Don’t stop podcasting tho
Dortmund v Shalke
Congrates on the retirement , Glad to see your happy . Enjoy
For ONE season, I would of been able to live away. But this is your choice and you had an amazing career, and are the most unbiased pundit/creator I know. A proper Legend
haha im sorry i had to laugh a bit when they were describing atlanta as a beautiful city full of culture and stuff. In america i think atlanta is mostly known for having terrible traffic and a bunch of gangs and violence and generally degenerecy, its a city that everyone avoids if they can help it.
Every credit for turning down a big stack of money at the end of your career for family. I wish we could all spend a little bit more time with family. Time is precious and has no value. I would of personally taken it and dived at the goalpost headfirst after a month  leave with a clumsy severe injury but still fill the pockets .
Lazio v Roma, Benfica v Sporting, Fenerbache v Galatasaray
Mate! I’m a 16 year old from South Africa and I just want to say, Ben, I’ve liked you all this time. The moment I saw you play for the first time on the tele, I became a Foster fan. Amd when you started the CyclingGK etc. I was buzzin’.  So congrats mate, you’ve had a great career. Honestly, you’re top.  And even though I’m not a keeper, you have been a huge inspiration.
really crazy to have a behind the scenes look at a retirement happening in real time
What a legend, winning the league cup with Birmingham, how do u even!? Timed the retirement perfectly with Federer's too. GOAT🐐
Chivas vs America in mexico is Saturday 9/17
Chivas VS America in Mexico
Western Sydney Wanderers vs Sydney FC in Australia. The biggest derby outside of Europe.
Would have loved you up here Fozza, the video content around the club would have been second to none.  Respect your decision though, family come first.  Best of luck with your retirement
By far the most human pod and person on youtube. You'll be missed on the pitch but fortunately we'll be able to follow you anyway. Can't wait for the next episode.  Keep being happy Fozzie, you deserve it.
Ben congrats on an amazing career, would you take on training for a marathon (for charity) or maybe even a triathlon? I think it would be cool seeing you transition and make for quality content.
Absolute legend. Massive congrats on an incredible football career. Life begins at 40? All the best with the next phase of your life. Keep up the great content. Love from Zambia 🇿🇲
You could go to DC United with Rooney
Ben you’re an absolute legend of the game. I always thought you were under appreciated as a goalkeeper. Best of luck with your next step!!
Mad respect Fozzy. Happy retirement!
Top as always!
Friggin legend fozzy
Such a Genuine Nice Person, Gutted you have Retired but wish you the best of luck with everything
great pro - what a career - as a spurs fan the carling cup (I think at the time) hurt but always enjoyed watching you play when possible - shame that Newcastle couldn’t have you this season as reckon pope would have loved it too but the road trips sound epic and I love these podcasts.
Ben think about coming to Serbia to watch the eternal derby, between Partizan and Red Star, i think you''ll love it!
wow, would’ve been great to see you here in Atlanta🤯🤧
Congrats on a great career Ben! 👏 Can't wait for what's next!!! Visca el Barca!!!
lille vs lens, PSG at OM
As a United Supporter, thank you for everything Ben Foster! True legend and Premier League hero. Good luck w retirement and I hope to see you in MLS soon!
Really really really enjoyed watching you play for untied and always followed your career after you moved. When I found the Cycling GK videos I saw a part of you I always wanted to see from a footballer now these pods are mint Fozzy. This episode as a fan was so awesome to get a peek in the background of the game and truly made me feel as if my best mate was almost signed by New Castle it's so refreshing to see this side of someone that's had a career in a field that I and millions across the world have envied. Up the Fozcast boys can't wait for the next one
Boca vs River Plate bro!!!! Old Firm as well
Gutted to hear about you're retirement Fozzy! Sounds like you've definitely made the right decision however! All the best with everything you do and can't wait to keep following you media career!   P.S...If you do go to the MLS you should consider the Vancouver Whitecaps! Would love to see you in goal for our local professional club!
Just listening to this podcast has shown me that you deserve the upmost respect. You are an incredible goalkeeper. And the Premier league will miss you. I’d love to see you out here in the US, but family comes first. You’re a class man Ben. Wish you all the best
Congrats on an amazing career Ben, your a top man and great goalkeeper happy retirement ❤
Best of luck in retirement Ben, keep smashing the YouTube stuff and I’m looking forward to see whatever else you get up to. Massive respect to you sticking to your guns and always being honest with yourself
I have to say it’s so unusual to hear a professional footballer to say that he is happy to be retired from playing. I’m happy too because I love Ben’s podcasts and you tube channel, but that’s me being selfish. I admire his honesty in putting his family first over money (and I am assuming the Newcastle offer would have been been very financially generous) it just goes to show that it’s not all about money and full respect to Ben for that. I also respect that Ben have is comfortable in retirement a lot of players dread the day retirement comes as again most professional footballers just love playing. I have always dreamed of retirement even as when I was as young as 30 (but obviously not as a professional athlete)
Thanks for sharing this incredible story Ben 👍🏻
Good luck mate. Go for manchester derby
Galatasaray VS Fenerbahce would be one you will never forget
If New England Revolution ever make an offer for you, I'd be hyped if you took it! Haha, in all seriousness, congratulations on your difficult decision! Best of luck on everything!
If you don’t come too villa,you need too do Panathinaikos Olympiakos
not from England but don't  do they like planes to each city or helicopters? I know England is small but what's the flight time from Midlands to Newcastle
I’m a West Brom fan AND an Atlanta United fan, absolute legend and role model for a fellow keeper (me), but sad he couldn’t finish out in Atlanta. Happy retirement, Ben Foster, thank you for all you’ve done, and if you ever want to come back, hopefully Carlos Bocanegra will have been fired by then and Atlanta will pay you what you deserve!!!
Enjoy the retirement mate Great keeper brilliant career top bloke
Ben did Everton ever contact you after the Pickford injury?
I hope he can do it one last time at the Sidemen Charity Match~
@BEN FOSTER, from watching your channel l learnt some key things about how much footballers sacrifice , like every weekend they play so can never do anything with family / friends on a Fri eve. Sat Eve, they usually in a hotel in preparation for the game. Week in week out for many years. Jeez....  You have had a great career. Do now what makes you happy.. Totally understand decision to retire and fair play.. Much love and respect
Legend Ben all the best in retirement maybe one season with the tags before you really hang the boots up
Your amazing Ben , top man, totally respect your choice and family in life is more important then anything , I am a coach ( youth Level 3 ) would love to meet you one day and have a chat , look forward to more of your stuff ,  Bill Shankly once said “ Retired from football but not from life “ 👏👏👏🥅🥅🧤🧤
Gutted about it but a class professional through your career ben and a top guy. As they say when you know your times up you know your times up. All the best with the retirement pal and enjoy yourself
Love you Ben all the very best😎🥰💋
THE LEGEND propper gk you was. 500th comment
I do hope you see this, I’d like to hear your thoughts on this Ben & the CGK team  I would like to see him come to an Ipswich Town game (yes I am a fan) to see not just the ground but what the atmosphere is like (recommend the North Stand [Sir Bobby Robson’s stand]) and what Kieran McKenna has done, the statues of Sir Bobby Robson, Sir Alf Ramsey & the newest one of Kevin Beaty “the beat”.  We have a history (I know we are in league one!).  Like I said I do hope you see this, I’d like to hear your thoughts on this Ben & the CGK team
Funny thing is they Offered Ben a 1 year deal at 39 years old and they only offered Karius and deal till January and he’s 29 years old
All the best lad! Shame you couldn't sign for us but fully understand why all the best with your feature endeavours.
I have to ask beacause i have kept track since you entered free agency but i saw a podcast either yours or theirs but you told the hashtag united lads that you wanted one year in The US and after that you would play for hashtag. So now having retired from proffesinal football Will you join hashtag united?
I would like to see Ben maybe making some videos about goalkeeping advice, especially after playing at the level he has done, but you can sit back now and enjoy your retirement mate
Congrats on an amazing career Ben, your a class act would of loved you to play for Cov but I'll let you off hahaa enjoy your retirement mate and keep the content coming I love it ⚽️💙⚽️
Great keeper and great career all the best Ben 👏🙌🏻
Really hope to see Ben as a 'Legend' in a YouTube/Social charity match soon!
You should Watch the swedish derby AIK and djurgården great game with crazy fans
Your analogy of the army and being a footballer was spot on, I’m an Aussie in the army and I’m about to get out of defence and what you said it’s spot
Surely there's a team near to where Ben lives that could use his services!!! Glad you're happy though mate
Can’t wait for those derby vlogs!
Arse. One more year at the Albion would have been great.
Ben we would have loved you at St James Park but your family must come first. Good luck to whatever you do in the future you will smash it, don't forget to visit us in the north east in the camper van.
End of an era. I remember you signing for Man Utd and followed you ever since. Fantastic career, well done and happy retirement.... What about Hashtag Utd? 🤔
What if the offer had come from a place close to home?
"It's a proper club - EVERYTHING is done properly". Say that to the families of murdered journalists and jailed woman for simply speaking. Congratz on an amazing career and congratz for not tarnishing your career by going to Newcastle.
How much did they offer you per week??
Would have loved to have seen you at NUFC mate but fully respect your decision - enjoy retirement mate! 👍🏻
Dear Ben Congrats on a fantastic football career, all the best for the future
Always hooked up on listening to Ben's stories as they are always so colorful. Would be great to maybe cross paths one day... Wish you a happy retirement legend.
Proper BCFC legend …. End of an era Fozzy, exciting times ahead, good luck with the next chapter….   But my god please don’t sign for Villa !!   KRO
Congratulations on you’re retirement Fozzy! Proper decent professional! Keep up the good work on the Channel #topman 💪🏻
An amazing insight - good luck to you, Ben.   Absolute legend 🤙🏼
Happy retirement Ben. It's weird that we've actually seen you go through your entire career ..  from #12 at United to #1 at Watford. Keep up the good work with the podcast etc All the best.

Thinks he's worth £100,000 a week ,😂
Fantastic career Ben sad to see it end ,also please take mark goldbridge in the camper 😂
Absolute legend Ben! Hope everything goes well in the future
Congratulations Ben! Problem with retiring is you never get a day off! Up the Fozcast
Hey mate it’s so sad to see you go lives you back at Manchester although dad might remember more than I do. Hopefully you can figure some stuff out with clubs and get behind the scenes occasionally and make some of your old style content as well . Love the work
Fossie....Thank you for your love and Commitment at Watford fc..I am sure Dan Bachmann misses you.Good luck with your On-line Career.Hope to see you back at the vic at somepoint supporting the lads.Good Luck Ledge.

Ben foster you legend, all baggies fans wanted you to end your career at the hawthorns, wasn't to be but you will always welcome at the baggies. You will forever be an Albion Legend.
Congratulations Foz!
As an Atlanta United supporter and a huge cycling GK I'm gutted to hear the timing didn't work out. Ben you've always been a keeper I've enjoyed even back at United when I first got into football but you've earned your time to do what you want!
a ben foster vlogging derbies show would make an incredible tv series
Soweto derby - Orlando Pirates vs Kaizer Chiefs #South Africa  🇿🇦   Happy retirement Fozmeister  Tubes adds such an awesome dynamic to the podcast 💪🏾

Enjoy your retirement, gutted you weren’t able to make it work you would’ve loved it and been loved. Glad you’re happy in yourself though. Love to you and your family.
As a expat over here would love to see you at Charlotte FC. MLS is def a passionate place to be. Plus Charlotte is a better place to be than Atlanta if you ask me..... If you do come I'll show you around!
Thank you for everything you done for West Brom a true baggies legend you will be greatly missed in the game u fricking legend❤️

Happy birthday bro
Go to denmark and see fc copenhagen vs brøndby
U bloody legend
What a decision to make!! Even having that offer on the table must have been unbelievable!! But you can’t sit on a bench on a rainy cold evening in the middle of winter missing not only your family, but your whole life! Money can’t buy what you have.
How about hashtag united?
When the heart says it's time.    It's time!! Enjoy your retirement enjoy your social media career....and most important..Party on!!! Good luck dude!!!
You should get yourself to St James’ for a game! Would’ve love you at the toon Ben but respect your decision. Enjoy mate 👍🏼
Rovers vs Burnley! Proper derby.
Napoli vs Juventus is a massive in Italy 🇮🇹 is a must honestly
This might mean nothing to you coming from someone like me lol, but you have gained my respect for that. For you, it wasn’t about money, you could’ve easily taken the money and just got on with training as a backup but you decided to follow your passion and begin the next chapter in your life. Good luck to you and happy retirement pal
Think The Arsenal needs another keeper.
Happy retirement ben keep up the YouTube stuff.

Congrats on a fantastic career! I hope you enjoy your retirement with your family. It's actually ridiculous how good you are even at the age of 39. You should be very proud of yourself on how your career has panned out.
Thank you for everything Ben. Loved u in man united. But ur born for this youtube/podcast life. enjoy mate!
what about hashtag united
Sad thought he would of done 1 more year but happy for him
This will forever be one of the saddest things, it was just 9 months Ben😔 but I respect your decision 100% and family comes first always
Nice one Fozzy Boing Boing
Luton vs Watford 😅
All the best in your future endeavors Ben!! Happy Retirement!! Would've love to seen you interacting behind the scenes with players and the daily life of a footballer cause you're a natural!!
Tell you’ve been out on the bike, you’ve got a right glasses tan!
You have had one hell of a career Ben. far to many footballers dont know when to stop, you have marked out a nice career for after retirement with things you want to wake up and do. thats precious. Onwards and upwards. enjoy your retirement, now get back to work 🤣
Bes Foster, what a guy
Cheers Ben. You’ve ruined my first signing for the upcoming Football Manager. I was thinking I was getting a solid free agent keeper to start off 😂 in all seriousness, enjoy retirement mate! Well deserved! Been a fan since your MUFC days
Legend
17:54 “what size goalie shirt are ya?”🤣🤣
Wrexham Legend, happy retirement Foz.
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Will remember that save against Gallen in the FA Cup quarter final against Argyle. When Ian Holloway was the manager at the time. You had a good game & Watford won 1-0.
Reckon this might just bag a mention on the next show. Onwards and upwards, Mr Foster... 👊 #GKUnion
All the best Ben .
Come Wednesday for season please
Are you still gonna post
Galatasaray - Fenerbahce. That one you cant miss.
Happy retirement, Ben! Cheers 🍻
Happy retirement! All the best mate
wish you all the best for retirement. gutted you couldn’t come to newcastle😂. enjoy retirement tho.
I'd like to see foster on a league of their own
It just shows how much of a legend he is turning down an life changing offer but turning it down because of family and other stuff.
💙💙⚽️
Total Respect for that decision !! Can't wait for those vlogs
Cambridge vs the posh
Absolutely gutted mate you would of been a club legend up at Newcastle.
Marseille lyon
You know you're happy and content with your lot in life mate when you can say no to a dream contract out of nowhere, Congratulations on a great career!
What can I say. As a Newcastle fan I'm gutted you didn't come as seeing the behind the scenes stuff at the club on the vlogs would be unreal and you pushing Pope would have been for the better.  Fair play to you taking family over money is an example that should be shown to the younger players to stay humble.   Enjoy your retirement mate and you will always be welcome in the Strawberry next to St James for a pint before a home game
Enjoy your retirement, you've earned it.
Would love to see Fozzie vlog East Bengal-Mohan Bagan! 100 yr old derby and one of the biggest in Asia.
Come to the north London derby Ben lad
Gutted I’m 25 and I grew up watching you top bloke  was my hero all the best fozzy
Sooooo, time for Hashtag?
I love how he put it. Very understandable. 20+ years in the biz, Time to enjoy your free time!
Can’t say I’m surprised the way you were talking on the Laura Woods breakfast show on Talksport. Think you could have still done a job in the Prem but family comes first. All the best in you retirement and I look forward to more of your podcasts
What if pope gets a serious injury tomorrow and they call ya with triple the offer
Where’s mark ?
Noooo😭😭 Will u keep doing football videos And playing amateur football?
Random thought but im concerned about Arsenals back up and if Ramsdale gets injured I think turner will be exposed. I do not like hating and I hope im seriously wrong. im happy to be wrong. But expect a call from arsenal  Ramsdale gets injured... hopefully he doesn't.. random!
Big big respect all time ido if i could have switch lives with anyone i would pick you
Respect man.
swans - cardiff
You should definitely go  Sunderland vs Newcastle (in a season or 2)
Congratulations on an amazing career Ben🙏💚enjoy retirement you deserve the best
Well done mate congrats on a fantastic career enjoy your retirement
We're right by you Ben, quality player and character, wishing you all the best, love to see everyone as supportive as I am about this
Still thought you had a few years left in the gloves Ben. All the best on your retirement. A thoroughly good goalkeeper and an even better person. More time for the Youtube now to.
I remember when a massive Watford fan was raving about him, and his move to Manure
you should rethink this slightly and give Hashtag a little go mate ahahaha😉
You did the right thing Ben! Just shows your not greedy and are doing something you enjoy 👍 good luck mate
Should of done it I reckon
Hell of a run Ben, longevity off the charts 👏
It’s easy to be nice with millions in the bank……..
DO IT
Look you need too change your mind...that stomach/gut feeling is not always right...think of the videos and vlogs..1-2 more years then your done...JUST DO IT.
But love from Germany, Ben! Absolutely amazing guy and goalkeeper! Enjoy your life!
Such an L hahahahah you thought you were getting another PL club 🤣🤣
Congrats on retirement, was half hoping you'd get a spot here in Vancouver (had a couple games with a minor league signing after injuries!) but can't compete with the likes of Newcastle. Here's hoping we see a spot for you again.
U should play in soccer aid or sidmen football or hashtag United
Big respect on a big decision...but mate what you have another 2years in you..so why not take it..I'm a Boro fan and scharwzer went too Leicester from Boro about same age as you and he won the PREMIERleague first season there...look JUST DO IT.. football and life short
Please don't go to talksport and make me hate you Ben 🤣
Ben, at same time i am happy you will stay on youtube, career was great now enjoy ur life man
Retired but open to playing if it's the right offer/the MLS. Sure 😂
It's a very personal decision and I respect Ben's.. BUT I'd have loved to see him active for another season (remember there's a World Cup break...) .. btw 9 months fly by and at 12 & 13 your kids are independent already..
All best for future mate . Top man and not a bad gk either .
As a Sunderland fan, thank you.
Congrats on an amazing career! Thanks for bringing us along for the journey! Hope to see you in a Hashtag jersey soon but enjoy your retirement and time with family!
You have to go and see Roma v Lazio, amazing atmosphere in the Stadio Olimpico!
What a man !!! I hated when Everton played against you glad your not in the sticks anymore , but what a man !!! what a player , good look in the next stage enjoy the family time 👍
Thanks Ben for that performance in the Arsenal cup win, will never be forgotten. Enjoy your retirement👍 KRO
Was hoping you'd sign for everton. Best wishes for retirement
Ben all the best to you mate. You went to the same secondary school I did in Leam. I find that cool: )
Happy Retirement Fozzy! You are absolute Legend! Loved by all the teams you played for! All us Blues fans rate you as one of the best if not the best we've ever had!!  The Channel is absolutely Wicked and you have one hell of a media career ahead of you! All the best pal 💙
So gutted you didn’t come to newcastle but this is the right time and the best decision for you. Amazing for even considering coming to our club❤️all the best for the future lad
HASHTAG HERE WE GO
Camper idea is golden make a show out of it. I would watch that. Campers, football and banter come on Fozzy ⚽️
cant even begin to imagine how hard it was to make that decision top top man
Enjoy retirement great episode
If you guys want to visit a derby purely for amazing atmosphere rather than quality football, then come to Bulgaria for Levski Sofia vs Cska-Sofia
if it was wolves would you have gone lol
Are you going to make any cycling videos?
Love how raw this is!
Well done on finishing after a great career. You've already made a great start to a media job that is a natural step that you could smash be it with sky, the BBC or even just your YouTube channel. Best wishes for the future.
Enjoy retirement Ben, definitely the correct decision
Congrats on a great career Ben. Enjoy the media life. You obviously enjoy it and are good at it. Look forward to seeing you more going forward.
Was very surprised Leicester didn’t come in for you. We massive need of a GK midlands club for you aswell
El Blazerico
You did the right thing Ben aslong as your happy pal
Great keeper!...any spare gloves pretty please lol
I watched u for just more or less 15 years, always rated u a top keeper. Really liked your brave & aggressiveness style of keeping pitty it was always for under achieving sides. Enjoy your semi retirement. As 38 year old myself I'd be happy if the Sunday league gave me a buzz for a game but I ain't half as fit as u are😅
As an American, would love to see you here BUT there's nothing more American than saying "we'll pay you in exposure" 🙄
One more season Ben
Neutral opinion here. I'm a Arsenal fan so never supported a team that u represented. But I have to say I'm a big fan of ur pod and u fozzy! The insight u provide is excellent and personally I can totally understand ur decision to not join Newcastle! Happy retirement and hope you have a great next chapter of ur life!
I think it is something a lot of people often forget when it comes down to transfers. Most people only look at the financials and the name of the club, but I can imagine there are so many more factors that go into deciding to do a transfer or not. I think the whole Frenkie de Jong transfersoap is somewhat similar, I believe he just proposed to his girlfriend in Barcelona, got a new house and plays at his dream club. So even though clubs like Chelsea and Manu offered good money and Barcelona seemingly tried to force him out, I can imagine he just wanted to stay, like you want to stay with your family,. although you could have earned a lot of money at Newcastle.
You could make a move into a defensive role and youll be guaranteed a spot in Southgates squad 🇶🇦🤣
You're a freaking legend brother all the best
Wearing that top i thought you'd retired years ago 😆
Man city will sign you Ben mark my words
Will miss watching you play. I wish you a Happy Retirement. GGMU.
I will miss watching you play. As a Manchester United fan you gave us good moments to remember and Cherish. I will miss those moments.
3-4 years for prem titles. That's wild. Surrounded by yes men on that one
FosterBridge full time.   The Ben Foster post-goalkeeper career output is going to be brilliant.
Congratulations on a wonderful career, Ben.
Gutted you didnd keep playing
Time to go to the tags fozzy
if you learn me the ways i will carry your legasee at watford if you teaschme the ways of goalkeepering
The Dundee Derby - Dundee United v Dundee at Tannadice Park is a great derby 2 stadiums are 180 meters apart and the atmosphere is great
Enjoy retirement Ben. What an amazing career. Would still love to see you in the field ngl. But also understand your stand point.
Wow mate what a story and fair play
Family is so so important. Good call Fozzy. And enjoy your retirement and all your time with the loved ones.
Congratulations on your retirement well deserved
Best of luck in retirement Ben! Thank you for your services at West Brom, I will always remember walking out with you as a mascot against Fulham about 8 years ago 😅 see you at the brunt vs mozza game 👍💙🤍
Newcastle requires someone who wants to be there 100%. You need to be all in. Credit to Ben for having the balls to say no and break away from the norm of contracts, medicals, signings, new club etc.
Congrats Ben now enjoy your life
Top man
Absolutely gutted! Would have loved to have you at SJP Fozzy. What a keeper!
Top keeper, top bloke. Enjoy retirement mate 👍
Would love to see Foz hosting Soccer AM with Jimmy Bullard. Would be a cracking duo.
Good luck 🍀
Ben iv supported united since I was a kid 03/04 I started watching I can remember you at united always liked you to be honest always followed your career all the best big man you can be proud of your career
On the one side, surely a 6/7/8 month stint there could have provided you with a public farewell (as well as still playing for a bit longer).  On the other hand, maybe you've not got the same energy as you had 15 years ago. Plus the YouTube side, it seems you've already transitioned subconsciously and would never return to football.  Their loss, YouTube's gain  🤘
Not to be that guy, but does this mean you're no longer planning to play for Hashtag? I remember last year on a podcast you saying that you want to join up with the tags for a couple of years after a stint with the MLS.
Love the podcast. Best of luck in retirement, Ben!
Top bloke, Ben. In your words, absolutely "wicked". Looking forward to more Fozcast content. 👍🏻 Happy retirement.
Where did you get this jersey from Ben? I wanted the blue one!!!
30:25 Ben!! Currently in Atlanta here and an avid fan of Atlanta United! Hopefully the offer can stay on the table and we can see you in an Atlanta United kit! You and your loved ones would love it here!
shit i thought for real that you would announce your retirement - what a fraud
What a belter of a career looking forward to seeing more content on here mate 🙌🏻
As a Blues fan over seas <3! Saw seaman at st Andrews as a kid but you're my keeper. Thanks for the cup and the fozzcast (it brings me home). Also see you @ San Siro. my kid's an inter fan and I'll be there (i always wear my blues jersey to inter)
West Brom legend, gutted thought we might see you pull on the Baggies shirt again, fair play though great goalie 👏
What did you ask for
Sad day. Last season you made two world class saves against use at the London stadium. Good luck in all you do
Midlands ... call Brenda's.  You can be Leicesters number 1.
Congratulations on a fantastic career, looking forward to what’s next!
Congrats on a very succesful career 👍
come to copenhagen for FCK Brøndby its insane
Fozzy was one of the best to ever do it. No other Prem goalie could juggle the YouTube stuff, with playing for Watford and I wish him nothing but the best in retirement
Really happy for you, Ben! Clearly the right decision for you, and that’s what matters.
Close your eyes and could quite easily be Ricky Gervais
WHAT A CAREER! Enjoy your retirement Fossy!!
Blues V Villa🙌🏻
get Stuntpegg and Thogden on a travel vlog!
Was hoping all summer that you'd have joined Leicester,👍all the best
Outstanding Ben 👏🏻 biggest derby you have to go to? Yes you said it old firm at Celtic park 🍀
I think you're going to regret that  decision in a few years time. Loads of men live away from their families for work during the week, not a unique situation. Surely you could have worked something out.
Gutted to hear your retiring but completely understand the reasoning behind it all. I'm sure whatever you do going forward you will smash and keep up the great content 👏
Unbelievable. Couldn't be bothered to join Newcastle as the journey was a bit long???!!! Personally I think Foster bottled it as he suspected his goalkeeping might not be up to snuff. I do like these videos but the sad thing is there is no one to challenge him, just a couple of mates there as a comfort blanket. Ben listen you are a long time retired mate you shouldn't be turning down a chance like that, football is a hard game and people remember these things. It's not right!!!
All the best fozzy, ur mate boaz was sat a few seats away from me last night.. didn't realise his beard was so big 🤣 we were lucky to have u pair as our no1 and 2.. great keepers boing boing 👍
whats with the weird sunglasses shaped tan?
Would have loved to have you at NUFC! Would have been great all around, congratulations on the retirement Fozzy!
Congrats ben
Ben Foster is a massive twat, don’t know 1 person that likes him
Congrats on the career pal, like I said on another video, gutted to have never seen you in a wigan shirt!!!
West brom vs Birmingham
Bumblebee first game should be Dortmund
Cheers Ben, you are the best keeper that we had had down the albion in the last 40 years, good luck in all your future endeavours.
we could’ve had this goat and now we’ve got karius 😭
What’s the intro song
Top goalkeeper one of my best memories was the shootout for utd against spurs all the family sat watching it. My dad didn't even like football and actually sat and watched it
Would have been brilliant to have you up in newcastle but fair play,  glad you made the decision that would make you happier. Its nice to hear that you have some respect for newcastle as a club.
Retirement from Youtube,,, been a while coming. Peaked during Covid, been on the decline ever since. Best of luck on your next chapter. On Tik Tok. Or part of Sky or whatever.
Enjoy Retirement, well deserved, time to enjoy yourself
Think I’m going to be the only one to say it… think Foz might regret that in the future. One year.  But… what a guy, what a player, 100 respect the decision for himself and his family. Good luck and enjoy it !!
The Newcastle vlogs would’ve been insane but you’ve earned your retirement sir. Look forward to your future content and enjoy your retirement!
Do a podcast with under the cosh lads?
He repeated the same story about not going to Newcastle at the start. Sounds like you're trying to convince people to make you go.
Congratulations on an incredible career Ben, brilliant pod as usual. And top support from Rhino Legs too! Ready to drive Ben to Newcastle but stays out the way of the decision because he knows what would be best for business isn't necessarily what's right for his best mate. Cracking podcast and good luck with the next chapter!
Tbh Foster will do well after retirement since now starting his YouTube Career
Great career Ben !! My little man's hero for the last 4 seasons! Hope to see you in the van at the vic against Luton
Need to get the agent on the pod asap
ATLUTD has a beaut kit this year. Might have to get u one with the name on it🔥
Honestly I’m just sad … just started following you one year ago …🥹🥹
That thumbnail drew me in so hard!
We are not the biggest in the world but Feyenoord - Ajax is the biggest game in the Netherlands. Its called de klassieker (the classic).
From across the pond , Ben we all loved seeing your behind the scenes vlogs and all your challenges and the fozzcast you legend!!
Federer and Fozzy retire same day, coincidence ? No, its what GOAT's do!
Ben foster for hashtag United when lmao jk congratulations on your amazing career we’re glad to have you on YouTube for good now
Cracking content through the years and a genuine inspiration especially during some difficult times in the pandemic too. Amazing keeper. Already missing the gopro in goal and great to see you still creating content and excited to see the cycling combined with everything else. Thank you!
Thank you for all the memories Ben, you were a massive part of football for me growing up. Always putting in your best performances against against the Chels. You are still one top, top man, and top, top keeper mate!! Its great to see its a decision that brings you happiness Ben! Cant wait to see whats next Fozzy!
Really wished Foster would've came to Atlanta. We would've loved you here plus we really needed you. Good Luck in retirement a real legend!
You’ll probably never reply to this Ben but you’ve got to watch Bordeaux. I moved from Newcastle to live just south of Bordeaux… if you love wine, strong beer/cheese/foie gras and pate this is the place to visit!
Not strictly retired just yet.. you're in Brunty's team for the ledgends match next week pal! 👍  All the best on your retirement mucka, pleasure seeing you keep goal at the Baggies for nearly 10 years. Boing boing
Rare example of someone not giving in to the pressure of money 👏🏻👏🏻
I think you've made the correct decision to retire.  If you wern't able to move up north after unwinding and spending the entire summer with your family, then you'd probably have talked yourself out of any approach made.  Atlanta & Newcastle.
Congratulations on your career mate. Would of loved to have you in the toon but family always takes priority!!
Congratulations Ben! Would love to see you stateside one day.
Southampton Vs Pompey
FUCK!! Was really hoping Albion would offer you a deal…Blues beat us 3-2 yesterday and they only had 3 shots on target! Button isn’t the guy!
You sighning for hashtag😉?
Go play for hashtag
Copenhagen vs Brøndby
It's 9 month,same country 4 hours away. Still seeing family every week. Ridiculous amount of money. Can not believe he turned this down. Im a mackem married with 2 very young kids.
It's a shame, cos as a toon fan I would have loved to have seen you up here. But full respect for your decision, family and mental well-being comes first always. Good to hear our execs seem to be good people as well!
I thought you were already retired
The mighty Preston North End vs Blackpool Fozzy. Big big derby, get yourself there lad! Congrats on a great career 👏🏻
"We're somewhere in the Midlands" "28:20" We're in Leamington Spa  😅
Did you consider/ would it have even been possible to live 2 hours away from home, 2 hours away from Newcastle and travel home each day, probs not much worse than midlands to Watford? I know that would mean you would have to leave early to get in and wouldn’t really get to socialise with teammates but could have worked.
LETS HOPE POPIE IS NOT INJURED FOR THE FA CUP FINAL NXT YEAR 🤔..
You are a legend!  I wish you were coming to the Albion but best of luck
2 games I really want to see you guys do: AC Milan v Inter Milan & Arsenal v Spurs
The decision is only right if it makes you happy. Have a great retirement (semi-retirement)  Ben Foster. I will be watching the Podcast.
Happy retirement Ben!
Great episode, would have been amazing to have seen you sign for Newcastle but at the same time we wouldn't be getting the road trip match vlogs so really looking forward to this new chapter and all the videos along the way.
As a Liverpool fan this is gutting. Ben showed fans a different view to football both on and off the pitch. Absolute top fella and top keeper. Happy Retirement Ben 👏👏
You can just tell Ben is a top lad just by the way he speaks about family, football, his friends and everything. Happy Retirement mate, can't wait to see what's coming next👏🏼
I would of took that.
Good luck in retirement Fozza, great career behind you and lots to look forward to on your channel in the future 👊🏾⚽️
Get yourself down Stratford Town lad 😉
We all want you to play football for a couple more seasons but if that’s your decision that’s fine
Can't wait to see what's next, top man and thank you for a fantastic career
Legend 🙇
Going to miss BTS match day vlogs but all the best in retirement.
top goalie happy retirement ben !❤
Top GK Ben, I love the podcasts and a good honest insight on the potential toon loan deal. I totally understand your views. Enjoy your retirement. Keep up the good work. Big up to your team as well.
Keeping doing you Ben! Great career and big decision which you stuck with your character in making. Now with your free time, my Sunday league team need a keeper in Manchester. Be sure to bring your subs 👍
Tubes was class in this, made me laugh when he said he was glad the Newcastle contract wasn't signed.
As a Newcastle fan, I'm gutted you didn't decide to join us to see out your career, but I 100% understand and respect the decision.
How about Hashtag United?
Why retire u can still do it
Sums up what a top man he is a lot of people will have just took the money and been half the player
So happy too see him having an amazing career!!!! Thank you Ben!! What a journey!!!
Well done for turning down an amazing offer and putting your family first! Absolute legend, from seeing you play against Southend in the cup final for Wrexham (even if u did beat us) to now have enjoyed following your career and my 9 year old idolises you! Thankyou Ben
Roger Federer and Ben Foster retiring on the same day. Sad Day 😢
Join a non League club and vlog the games
I wouldn’t be surprised if we see Ben on sky during this season especially with him in the past advocating a goalkeeper to be on football programs and also him already being so comfortable infront of a camera
Wonder how much he asked for per week!
hashtag united next
What a tough choice to be fair. But you definitely earned the right to make that call
I respect your decision, but i think i wouldve you know 😀
Big ups to you Fozzie. Top bloke.
Can't believe you didn't do it Ben, I reckon you could have gone in Jan if it wasn't working! Sure half if that time will be world cup and you would get loads of time off 🤣 seriously tho enjoy retirement looking forward to what you and the channel have planned for the future!
At 36 years old forster has had one hell of a career.
Buzzing for your next adventures and where the YouTube content is going to go and an absolute legend!! Mate between the sticks and an absolute hero and inspiration to me fozzy!! Up the GK union !!⚽️🧤
Can't buy time. Good for you. Enjoy your family man.
Congratulations on a great career, Ben. Looking forward to seeing all the upcoming stuff you'll be up to.
What a legend, amazing career!  Enjoy your retirement 👍
Crvena Zvezda vs Partizan would be massive ;) Also Flamengo vs Fluminense.
What a man. Thanks for everything mate, always a baggie 💙🤍
10:21
Big respect for turning Newcastle down rather than going along with it. Some players would have gone for the dough and tossed it off for the year.
👏🏽 happy retirement Fozzy! Looking forward to the El Clasico video 👍🏽
An amazing career! Enjoy your retirement Foster
If your going to the biggest rivalries in Europe can’t be much bigger than fener vs gala surely?!
I think Ben”s last contract was £33,000 a week, if they offered him £40-£50,000 a week I think he’s crazy for turning it down. This could possibly be the last time in his life where he would have that earning potential. He could’ve probably banked 1.5 million net for one year and then retire.
Why did WBA not come in for him, maybe they did I’m not at that point, but no good keeper right now, midlands, ex player good quality keeper
What a career! Congrats on your retirement and continue to smash it on YouTube! 👏
There's only one Ben Foster 🙌 you will smash it with your brand and being your own boss! Keep up that positive energy!
Hashtag debut?
First roger Federer now the GOAT BEN FOSTER 😭😭😭
Happy Retirement Ben, as a Newcastle fan, I wish you had come and had a final swan song at the Toon, maybe you can stick a retro Newcastle shirt on for “what you wearing” some time soon to make up for it haha. Best of luck in your retirement mate.
All the best in your retirement Ben!!
I’m a Newcastle fan mate would of loved to of seen you in a Newcastle kit but family and other stuff has to come first mate, happy retirement bud
Hashtag Utd anyone .....?
Top man loving the content
LAZIO v Roma, Boca v River, Celtic v Rangers, Red Star v Partizan, HAPPY RETIREMENT BIG FOZZY!
Been watching more and more of your videos recently and enjoying your energy in everyone of them. Congratulations on retiring and hopefully the party doesn't involve bursting 🎈 😂
Seem like a top lad so I wouldn’t be too bothered about not having an immoral sportswashing project on your resume. All the best with the media work.
happy retirement ben! top top  person.
Oh :( I was expecting to see u with black and white stripes
Congratulations on your career if you ever fancy a run out up myton five a side give me a shout 😁👊🏽
Top keeper for past 15 years enjoy ur retirement maybe one day u get icon card or hero card in the future
Up there with my favourite Albion players easily. Enjoy the retirement Ben
Would have been nice to have you at the Toon Ben, but totally understand your decision! Enjoy retirement and the extra time with your Family
Congratulations on your career and enjoy your retirement
Ben is a top lad enjoy retirement
I am a little bit gutted if I'm honest, you've been a constant in football and its sad to think you're out of it now BUT, from what you've said you've made the right decision mate!
All the best in retirement 👏🏽
You are a legend, Ben! You have had a great career and I hope to meet you one day!
Respect to your decision 👏. See you in the MLS next year. Your enjoy a nice year break and then get an offer for you and the family to enjoy a final year in the states 100%!
You've got to see Hajduk vs Dinamo in Croatia
Would have loved to see you at the toon big man maybe a few years earlier! Enjoy the retirement
Did he seriously tease a Newcastle move all day and then bloody retire 🤣🤣🤣
Enjoy your retirement Ben 👏 as a Newcastle fan I totally understand your decision not to join us good luck in retirement 👍👍⚫⚪
Sorry but you aren't retiring Ben...#...?
Happy retirement hashtag united 🔜
Congratulations on an amazing playing career mate, and already smashing the next one! #UpTheTags
Baggies fan here. Honestly, so gutted Ben's not coming back but I cant blame him whatsoever. What a career. I remember having a Kick annual with a comic version of the Carling Cup final penalty save. Then watching him win the Carling Cup with Blues. THEN he was OUR player. Best keeper I've seen at the cub. Good Luck Fozzy. Good effort son
Another great episode and congratulations on your retirement football ain’t gonna be the same! Can’t wait for the Camper podcast 🤣 defo need a few live streams up for that one, best of luck in future endeavours and again what a fantastic career. ICON card needed in fifa
, I was hoping this day never came to say you’re the reason for why I became a keeper and the experiences I’ve had in football have been great and it wasn’t just your ability what Inspired but your personality. Have a great retirement and keep up the good work with YouTube will see you on sky sports in no time 💙
Whyyyy
Would’ve loved it if u came too rangers
Absolute legend Ben foster, we’re all so proud of the career you’ve had and we wish all the best of luck in your future endeavors including your YouTube channel!! We love you, Ben!❤️
Ben tell them ill be second goalie for 4k a month. I would be perfect for what they want to build my distribution is Ederson esc
It's been a good ride ben😢
You’ve transitioned into a brilliant YouTuber. Only up from here mate! Been following you since your days at United. Brilliant career
Nooo
I have no idea why Leicester City aren't banging your door down to sign you for a season.
After all the sacrifice to the family  during a footballers carer is akin to the military. Do not blame Ben for taking this step, not that you need it but good luck with this next chapter!
Happy retirement Fozzy! Unbelievable memories down through the years.Enjoy your retirement and keep smashing everything your doing on YouTube 👌
Great career mate 👏 and happy to have seen you play for UTD.....now we'll be expecting more content 😁
As a Newcastle Season Ticket holder, it would have been class to have you. Fully respect your decision though, family first.
I’m a Newcastle fan and I completely respect your decision well done on your retirement and brilliant career I can’t wait to see what’s next
Happy Retirement Ben, GL in all you take on next
Fair play Ben loved your carrer especially at blues I love u Ben keep up the good work and good luck in the retirement
Good Luck in your retirement ! Top Keeper LEGEND
Am I the only one sad that I can’t sign Ben as my backup keeper on career mode anymore ?🥲🥲
Should have took it, couple months up there, month off before Xmas, then only 5 months til the end of the season, few quid in the pocket, then go be dad the YouTuber
Would of been class to see you up here. Respect your decision mate, family is everything. Enjoy your retirement!
When you become a man you start making decisions for your family.
this clip sums up this decision https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJPI1qu9bE4
Happy retirement Ben!!!
Gutted - would have loved you to play for the Toon! Completely understand your reasons though. Keep up the good work on the fozcast !
Top keeper and top top person ⚫️⚪️
As a Newcastle fan I’m absolutely gutted. But good luck to you mate. You’re a top bloke
Does this mean you cannot play for Hashtag United?
Ben Foster ❤️
What a legend! Top professional and your doing it on your terms, with a smile! Good luck!
legend
Happy retirement Ben! Looking  forward to what the future holds for you, hopefully more amazing content for us🤞🏻
What a tough decision ABSOLUTE RESPECT for sticking to your gut feeling. Inspiring and Happy retirement 👏👏
he might not miss it now being so long in the game, but I promise you, come end of the season he will regret not having at least one more season esp at Newcastle.
Live in the midlands eh? should've gone to stoke we need a goalie. Congrats on retirement legend
Gutted for Ben retiring but couldn’t wish him a happier retirement
wish you signed for newcastle my team :(
Being a geordie through and through I would love of seen you in our kit
Good luck Ben! Cheers from tokyo!
4 hour drive to newcastle…. Naaa 8+ hour plane journey… yeeeah
Best goalkeeper I’ve ever met, hope you will have a great time in your new chapter
❤️
Fozzie it's not always about the money,you made the right choice ❤️
Happy retirement Ben be a pleasure watching you when you come to st Mary's 😁😁
Enjoy your Retirement Ben great Pro enjoy your Media work Now 👍
Happy retirement Ben! Great career as a goalkeeper
Good luck in retirement Fozzy, what a legend!💪🏻
how about the a league in the future benny
Enjoy the retirement Ben, especially after a fantastic career!
Ngl ben would have loved a year more of pl matchday clogs. These vlogs were something no premium subscription of anything could offer. But your point of view is understandable as well. Good luck in retirement mate ❤️
Top respect for you talking about it Ben, making sure your family come first. You've been a class GK all round.   Many thanks  Harry
i thought you would have gone mls straight away tbh id loved to know the wage he put forward to newcastle 😂
The Goat retired today..... also Federer aswell
legend! happy retirement Ben!!
Still far to good to retire.  Glasgow Rangers could do with you.
It's going to be sad not to see the gro pro in the goal
Gutted you never came to the toon, would’ve loved to have you here. But understand the reasons and wish you all the best for retirement. Life begins now for you mate 🚴🏽‍♂️🎤🎙
Should me manager for the sidemen charity match 👍👍
Happy retirement Ben! Congratulations for your fantastic career.
Legend
Did Ben think about asking for the big wage from Newcastle...plus a daily helicopter ride back and forth?! 1 hour each way becomes a lot more doable...
Ben, I would've loved you at us but I totally respect it. Live your life and have a great time with your family. What a great career!
LEGEND
So you’re semi retired
Love ya FOZZY. Happy retirement
Congratulations Ben on your fantastic career you’ve had in football! 🥳⚽️ it’s a shame you couldn’t have had a goodbye game. You smash the YouTube and podcast side of football. Keep the content going and once again congratulations 🥳 #uptheFozcast
Newcastle is a great city. Great club too. But I did wonder if they'd struggle to attract top players. Not because of anything other than location.
Sad not to have you on fifa again 😅 What a goalie! ❤️
Sorry to hear that top goalkeeper and top bloke. Enjoy your retirement all the best
Time to join the Tags perhaps? 👀
So is the Moral "Don't have a Family and Live your Dreams?"
What about off-shore workers or HGV drivers that spend weeks and weeks away from their families for less than a percent a week of what you would have been earning?? Seems a bit mad to me bro
Jesus this doesnt make our negotiation team sound good 🤣
I hear Hashtag are looking 👀
Best of luck Fozzy, hope retirement treats you well ❤️👐
any chance you can get rid of tubes to make the podcast more bearable 🙏
NOOOOOO! Enjoy the beginning with this new chapter!
Happy retirement but its funny that 38 year old Ben was first pick over kerius 😂
True legend of the game, the premier leagues loss is our gain. good luck with retirement, you will no doubt smash whatever you put your hands too.
Such a shame mate, would have loved to see you in black and white. Have a good retirement my son
As a Newcastle fan this podcast is breaking my heart 😥 would of loved Ben at the toon but you can't hold it against the  man for his choice not to go it is fully understandable but now you will have gabby abonglahor on talk sport saying I told you they would rather live down south 😂😂
Happy Retirement Fozzy 🔥
Thank god we didn’t sign ye then, money grabbing arse wipe who laughs in vlogs while his team get relegated. Going on about driving up to Newcastle when you drive to Watford?? Behave yourself
HASHTAG UNITED PLEASE
My two opinions on what you should do. Replace Jeff Stelling when he retires on Gillette . I reckon you'd do a cracking job and defo got the persona for it. (Of course you can't just walk into it but I defo think if they decided to offer you or give you the chance that would be un real) Or go into GK coaching at a decent club, continue with the training vlogs of course, would be wicked to watch and of course you'll still have your goalie head on haha.
Ben seems oblivious to the fact trains and planes exist.
More than capable playing at a very decent level . To retire from football to chat Bob with YouTubers is a bit odd
Honestly Ben, as a Toon fan that's big of you. I'd have welcomed you at the club - best of luck on the retirement
Bloody Ronger Federer stealing your thunder! All the best with retirement! Loving the channel - look forward to seeing what's next!
good luck Ben. GGMU
Congrats Ben. I TRUELY believe it takes a strong individual to walk away from a sport that you clearly love. And to be fair I suppose you haven’t really walked away. The content is entertaining and consistent so you’ve already become a pro in your new career path.    Have a good retirement bro 😎
@HashtagUtd 👀
Fozzy should’ve have signed for hashtag tbh
Bad decision Foz. You gonna regret it.
Congratulations on the retirement Fozzy, guttered you haven’t come to sign for the Toon. Would have been mint to have you but well done for the amazing career💪👏
Enjoy yourself!!
What a friggin legend ! Now you can go in goal for soccer aid !!
Would have loved to see you at Newcastle..!
Thought you would play for hashtag oh well good luck Ben
ben, you are such an awesome keeper. truly inspirational and im sure lots of people will miss you. wish you the best in your future and we will all miss you dearly as a footballer. looking forward to listen to your podcasts all day. cheers!

Fair play Ben for all you’ve achieved! Would you ever consider doing a season at Wrexham as a swan song?
Happy retirement you absolute legend❤ Full time youtuber now eh😉

What a Legend Ben Foster! Good luck in retirement and good luck in any future events that you will be involved in! A true role model to young people and goalkeepers the football industry will miss you. What a true legend!
I’m gutted about that personally but it’s well deserved. Happy retirement ❤
Happy retirement, could’ve been up here with Nick Pope but it’s alright I promise 😢
