I know this is older and I watched it a few times.... but now thinking of it a collab between Ateez and Rain would be actually dope.
Time for this ❤
Immortal Kings
Love love love
에이티즈는 그야말로 넘사벽❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇦🇷
Stage gods ❤
This one of the hardest k-pop songs to perform live, especially if you're also dancing so intricately. ATEEZ are phenomenal in this!!! I feel like a proud older sister/mum after watching this! So glad I became an Atiny!
윤호 되게 순하게생겼는데 센컨셉 잘받아먹는거 신기함

진짜 심장떨린 ㄴ디 어카지
That I really missed the Ateez immortal performances,San defying gravity, Yeosang and his sexy dance starting out the New Year right 2025 💜💜💜
Our Pride & Joy, Our Kings! 241212 ♥︎
Sometimes coming to watch this performance isn't a want but a NEED... their Immortal songs performances are some of my absolute faves!
Nothing, and I mean absolutely NOTHING, could ever have prepared me for Yeosang in this performance. I stopped breathing.
뭘 좋아하는지 몰라서 다 넣었어요~하는 느낌
Yeosangggggg❤❤
💜 it's Jongho's birthday month! Tune in to 「Birthday」 Ateez's 4th Japanese single << 2024.10.2 >> release
Yeosang you are soo good...  I'm dying with your performances...

Me  gusta conocer cada vez mas de la cultura y la historia de Korea.Un pais que resurgio de una guerra clmo el mas adelantado  de esa.parte del mundo y de manera ordenada, sana y con una muy budna calidad de vida para sus ciudadanos.
Yunho's and yeosang's voice are so beautiful and velvety omg 😭😭
I cannot begin to describe how much I need them to do another performance of this.  It's been three years.  They're even more incredible now.  Honestly it could kill me, but I would die SO happy.
Ateez forever love you you you you you💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Congratulations 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💘💘💘💘💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞

Coachella Kings ❤
4TH GEN LEADERS
Happy Seonghwa Day, Atinys! 🎉 Happiest 26th Birthday to our performance king Park Seonghwa! Watching you on my hp screen, your live stage performances always leave me in awe. And my favourite moment in 2023 was definitely watching you & Ateez perform live on stage in concert 🥹 I'm so proudddd to be Atiny!
Wooyoung… oh my god….
Coming after Yeosang parts edit. Totally captivating 🥵🥵
This is sooooo goood
🎉❤
It's Raining 😊 ATEEZ everywhere! The big wave is coming 🌊
Zibilyonuncu kez izledim tamam ama 0:52 SAN!!!
So good every time
i absolutely love how they are utilizing that amazing vocalist of theirs. in other groups they would have tried to fit him in no matter what, at the cost of vocal quality. but they didnt, so he has the time to sing to the fullest, which is amazing to see. they really are an amazing team with amazing energy
@Roscoe
Wooyoungs part at the start makes me wanna squeeze myself
Amazing!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I still feel amazed how Ateez is not only the first K-pop boy group to win immortal songs but also the only K-pop group to win many times. I'm so proud of my Ateez. They're the true 4th generation leaders
this performance is so underrated, it really deserves more attention
( v^-゜)♪ Happy 5th Anniversary, Ateez!  Always doing us Atinys proud! Have fun at the Immortal Songs concert in US ☆  ♡48♡
이거는 진짜 정윤호가 센터에서 사람 미치게함…
im back here again thinking about how i like this version of the song itself better than the og... the jazz is just too good LOL
This brings My teenage memories back❤ Love it.
La señora me representa casi me da un infarto viendo a yeosang🥵😍
ATEEZ is allergic to not slaying. ❤️‍🔥  ~ 2,126
Slayteez
ادماني
am not okay
i love wooyoung so much
Tolle Performance aber, gesanglich nicht so gut
개인적으로 이 버전으로 음원 나왔으면 좋겠다 ... 이거랑 롸잇나우 둘다 ... 제발 ... 싺싹빔 ... 저 이제 원곡 못 들어요  후렴부분에 왜 저런 사운드 편곡을해서 나를 이렇게 힘들게 만들지 ... 맨남맨날 들응러와요 ... ㅠㅠ
forever will be one of my favorite stages
개쩔어.
3:45 San is showing us the benefit of engaging our cores while working out. Good luck.
Reyes❤
🎉 Congratulations you found the answer to Emoji Treasure Hunt Puzzle # 1🎉 ( july 31)
Wooyoung, San, Hongjoong, Seonghwa, Yunho, Minji, Yeosang, Jongho..... I can't help but love them all for their best performance.... God Bless You❤
ATEEZ....there is no sentence as 'Enough' in your dictionary I guess.... Every next song has more
If you can impress Rain… you won.  Great JOB
i think san is very rain style
Its Raining (a cover of Rain's song) is Ateez's 2nd Immortal win out of 4 total.  this perf shows you the immense talent bc only live vocals allowed.  Rain could not stop praising this cover
Думала, що подивлюся собі тихенько, спокійно. Реальність: ледве стримувала себе, щоб не пищати в автобусі
Ouuuu they ate this one up
i need wooyoung with this hairstyle again
Still not over thus
Jonghos lil growl sir🫠
Amazing performance ♡
MY ATEEZ THE BEST
2:54 san voice sooooooooo manly
love love love
It's raining Ateez at the mo.
so can we say hongjoong's best hair era
Wow!! Just wow!! They did a cover and make it their own, you can see them infusing their own style to the song
I can't get over this masterpiece
ATEEZ y RAIN loveee
I'm back...
Jongho at 03:23 😩😩
SO COOL 🔥
It's 2023 and this performance remains legend👑
개잘해...역시
3:45 San you did not just perform a handstand on a chair THAT flawlessly
I don't know why, but Wooyoung really give Rain vibe.  And i'm sure that BBtripping and Eden also know that.
just accept it, everyone's mind hits the gutter in the "ssssssh, aah" part lmao
I came back for the growl
진짜 너무 잘한다
I was so happy to see a standing ovation 🎉❤😊
8🪑with　fighting🥊today!!　IN TOKIO
os kingos da 4ª geração
2:20 just him growl
Such an underrated performance of theirs, it’s the mother of cyberpunk lmao
Acá pleno 2023 y de esta joyita no me olvido. Vamos ATEEZZZZZ
btw, Ateez maknae Jongho will be on the show end April.. He the one with the high vocals.
The only group with 3 Immortal wins. The show is only for artists who sing live so most kpop groups dont qualify.  Ateez do amazing things with chairs
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
There is something about San, when he's performing, it's so mesmerizing to watch, so pure dance moves, facial expressions, melodic live singing. Just love him so much.
They were giving their all but this bloody camerawork, i swear i am gonna kill 'em
Sonic ost type beat
Amazing performance! Ateez don't seize to amaze me!
yeosang just killed with his moves
Woahh main dancer Yunho really popping off right from the start i was shook af!! ayeeeee
its ATEEZing! Love you!
Seonghwa's dancing part really grabbed the attention 🥹 too powerful 🫠  Atiny since kingdom 💕 They really deserve world 🪐
Woah kinda miss their style in fireworks era
i really love san's graspy voice, he used it a lot in immortal songs and he sounds really good.
MY ATEEZ ♡
I still think its insane that ATEEZ is on this show 3 times (which means 3 different Artist/Theme) and won 2 of them. Like, for an idol group to be invited is rare enough, to be invited 3 Times, in the span of 2/3 months is just, Insane.
Performance kings <3
My Face was like ○0○ the whole video so please no more immortal songs shows or we will be killed 🌚🖤🔥🔥  I'm kidding we need more ofc 😪
Legends
Invite ATEEZ again plz
I think Purple mic is a talented singers' thing. Jungkook, IU, Jongho all them use purple mic.🙂

정윤호 ㅈㄴ 눈물나와... 왤케 잘함....
happy 2 years to this performance!
LET'S GO 2M
currently missing ateez on immortal songs MORE THAN EVER
Loved their hair colours from this time !
Ooh Papi Rain was so proud.  ATEEZ is truly amazing! The best! 👏
So so good
Rain is so happy with this cover
all i know is that atz did something legendary with this performance and that’s for sure. 😋
Yunho smile 😊
Epic performance
ATEEZ killed it! as per usual ofc and im lovin how the Choi brothers both have red hair uwu
i've watched this before but i'm still shocked by their amazing performance 🤧🔥
San pick hair needs return
I SWEAR THIS PERFORMANCE AGED LIKE FINE WINE
It's raining !!
1:52 San here… omg he’s crazy
I miss when ateez went to immortal songs :( such fun times
952
An abomination of a remix how dare they ness with jybussy perfection
Getting a Standing ovation from 'Rain' is definitely not an easy thing. He is such a perfectionist...but ATEEZ did that y'all. My ateez will forever be famous 😭😭💖💗. I'm such a proud atiny !!
I'm back here after seeing this about a year ago and it's still amazing! Ateez has grown so much in a year. It's still a shame that Mingi couldn't join them but he was there in our hearts.
ATEEZ live are just the best !
Wow! Breathing new life to a classic. Thank you for this Ateez!! 😭
This is the performance that my mom enjoyed. LOL.
To think there are baby atiny out there that may not have seen any of their immortal performances
Back for some rainism
946,596
Here with a brew 🔥
So cool
We missed you Mingi
946
Legendary
So good
YES! Here Yeosang almost K word that lady…
OMG ATEEZ always set the bar too high.
This ....wow...❤
My gosh. They're so amazing! 🔥✨♥👏
kaget banget, asal dengerin playlist mix ateez aja, eh tau tau kok ada desah-desah wkwkwk
This one of the best performance in the whole K-pop industry!! And that's did by my Ateez, so proud of them.
Back to hear Jongho growl
I also enjoyed this performance!
저어기 저 검은색이 가장 잘하는구만
Lets reach 2M views ATINY
volví
2:19 its a crime to not talk about the growl jongho did during his part
Let's get it 2M soon, Ateez best performers of the year!!!!
I love Junho's voice. All those guys are very talented. Rain definitely loved it
best
Who else attempted inhale and exhale seductively with them? 😂🔥
Trash compared to RAIN who was trained by JYBUSSY
Ruining the original produced by JYBUSSY
How to cover Rain? Stay in character. Ateez nails it!
Shitty version
ateez are just amazing. period
After Black Cat Nero this is my 2nd fav ATEEZ  Immortal song stage
Immortal JYBussy
❤️🔥🔥
Ateez are top tier performers period 🔥💘
Love ateez but this rendition of It's Raining sucks.
Wow so close to 1.9M!!
에이티즈 !
887,227
Iconic and beautiful
jongho growl . wuhh !!
Wow this is such a great performance! Everyone did so amazing
And again :)
It's Raining
They are the coolest
I love that they did this again in their Fireworks comeback showcase.
Talento de sobra
why i found it today?, how can i be so late to find this killer stage, they left no crumbs seriously as always but yeosang here? he looks so confident i love it love it love it
에이티즈 🤍
AND NOBODY TOLD ME???
3:45 SAN ?!! literally my jaw dropped and the fact it's still dropping - how'd you even do these kind of things T.T !!!! I'm always amazed by your stage performances .
NADIE LE TOCA LOS TALONES A ATEEZ
Old Atinys how did y’all survive from this? Omfg 😭
There's no one like them
🤍
That was one epic stage! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
I *love* when Jongho growls in songs
ну ворлд доминейшен
ЛЕГЕНДАРНОЕ ВЫСТУПЛЕНИЕ
yall need to talk more about Wooyoung his vocals, stability and dance are no joke <3
The key to covering Rain is staying in character. Rain was all about being sexy-and they channel that character well in this cover.
Julio 29 ellos regresaran y la industria va a temblarrrrrr ! Vamos ATEEZ !
YEOSANGGG
me hago pis
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
yeosang <3
🔥❤🔥❤
❤❤
SLAYYYYY
It's easy to do what ATEEZ does but it's hard to do it like ATEEZ,
I love this stage-they we’re all channeling their inner Rain and really took this performance to new levels. I really love watching Wooyoung in this-he really nails the dance and looks sexy as hell.
TE AMO Jongho ❤
Still can’t believe Ateez did Fireworks comeback, this and kingdom at the same time. Totally insane. And: Half of the group filmed for a kDrama. Kings indeed.
Waktu ...berjln dgn gerakan tersebut 👌 tpi Pas waktu bernyanyi kurang sesuatu dlm gerakan... Di belakang tim member bisa Di brrbaiki lgi
Let's admit it. At 0:52 it's all of us, Atiny.😅
I swear san had me dying
ATEEZ 4TH GEN LEADER
There is something about Ateez that makes them vibe differently on stage. It’s not just the cool choreography, their synchronization, or their amazing vocal, but their energy and passion on stage - they paid wonderful tribune to Rain's artistry through their facial expressions, immersion of the concept, and gave their 110% energy.  You could see Wooyoung dancing in a very rain-ish sensual style; Hongjoong rapping in Rain’s cool and flamboyant mannerism; Jongho growling to show his wild side; San's sharp moves and putting on that bold act in the end; Seonghwa's vitality and fluid moves, and Yunho and Yeosang displaying that extra confidence that was even more than their usual selves. Everything about their act is so hypnotizing.
yeosang wtf oourr emm gee.
0:54 1:49
san so handsome
OMGGG
THIS IS THE TIME WHEN THEY HAD A COMEBACK AND PARTICIPATING ON KINGDOM TOO. LIKE GIRL THEY DONT SLEEP
This is sooooooo good!!! 😭
They are SO wonderful, i'm not a kpop fan,  but wow when I see Ateez is like Woow, they are fantastic singers and dancers,  kpop is not for Me But ateez, impossible not love them
ATEEZ KING
Ateez mükemmel ötesi , o bir yana dursun 1.36 sn de dansçıların omuz hareketi bağımlılık yapıyor....
san so attractive!
YESS

Hi

Do nada o San voando😅 eu amo esse minino! voa moleque, voa!

와~~멋짐 뿜뿜
no matter what people say, the truth remains that Ateez are the best and the most talented 4th gen performers. Ateez are the 4th gen leaders.
Almost  1.8M!! :D
omg san so charming
I always watch playful wooyoung and now here I didn't expect Kill me heal me Wooyoung kill the stage,✍️🤸🧚👯🕺

Oh lord...Yeosang is 🔥
Yeosang...that's the comment.
Notice how at 1:16 you can hear the clapping sound and the shoes clacking against the stage. ATEEZ 4th Gen Live Performance Kings!!
I always enjoy all Ateez performances they’re just so different and full of energy!
0:52 she's perfectly representing me during that part. Their ssssssaahhh and Rain, go rain gets me everytime! 😂
Am i the only Atiny who thinks Yunho stands out the most in this performance?😂 I mean they all are always good, but in this performance Yunho and his voice was highlighting the most!😍❤️
No supero el gruñido de Jongho hehW
ممهدين الطريق
Bro what I love about them is the fact that each member facial expressions on stage is a whole story, you'll never get tired of watching them preforming. The one and only "Pirate kings" 👑 never twice.(play to the beat in the back 😉)
Sannn so amazing
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow this is iconic goose bumps
Sizzle to Rain... They are Amazing...
이거 보고 느낀건데 윤호가 중심이 될때 이팀은 좋은 의미로 갱스터 느낌이 난다. 그냥 분위기상 알아서 비켜줘야 될거 같아. 저런 카리스마가 나오네 이팀은 그래서 멋있다는 겁니다. ㅎㅎ
Wow why did I not know about this
ATEEZ....... Amazing Kisses from Paraguay Sudamérica. Atiny latina present.
i cant even sit properly on a folding chair, how did san manage to do a handstand on one-
PERFORMANCE KINGS! YES I SAID IT KINGS
얘네들은 진짜 노력하는 티가난다.뭐든 최선을 다해.
The only band I'm interested in nowadays.
O topo já esta esperando vocês. Meus Reis.
비오빠 노래 특징 도입부터 개설렘
I can't believe what I'm watching these days is Ateez only... believe me you can not be Atiny but once you're atiny you can never be half Atiny, its very hard
00:48 Yeosang is so hot for this
ATEEZ KINGS!
우영아... 이 무대... 특히 네가 너무 자랑스럽다.. 춤은 말해 뭐하나 싶고 노래가 너무 늘어서 너무 자랑스럽고 멋지다... 우영이 꼭 백살까지 아이돌해줘 제발 오래오래 보고 싶다 항상 건강하고 사랑해...
에모야
They slayed the song and Us too!!️ ️❤️🔥😭👏👍
Ok they are kings but 8 makes 1 team   And I miss mingi
ateez my pride i love them
1:28 the woman was too stun to speak 😂
I'm obsessed with this! Ateez really nailed it!
The jazz version sound boring, sorry. I prefer the original that goes hard.
0:51 THIS LADY IS ME HAHAHAHAHA
Que orgullo stanear a Ateez!
Wuuaaaa
wooyoungs voice suits this song so much
I know you put in a lot of effort this year         You made me so proud of you that I came         For me, I think you did a great job this year      Awards do not determine your level of success or the level of strength of your songs, you are much higher than that        Know that, my ATEEZ level is much higher than that         It's enough that this year we got a lot of things        I have special memories of this year together        For me, you ATEEZ are able to convey your feelings in a way that is like you, and that is important        So, just you win or lose doesn't mean you are not enough       Winning or losing does not determine your strength or your level of success         Remember that your loss is also a gain that you learn from       And also have a good time with her         So don't consider it a loss, don't underestimate yourself         Don't underestimate your efforts, so I don't see you lose         On the contrary, for me, you are always victorious in our hearts and feelings        So this year, I made sure to let you know my feelings for you         Also, although I'm shy to support anyone         So you're the first person who made me come out        About my silence and my support for my feelings for today and I will continue to write to you every day        As long as you do it for us, I have to do it from         Yes, I'll protect you with my feelings too, stay well  🌈🐬🦋🦔🐥🐧🌸🌻🥀🖤💜💛
Sensacional. Perfect! Ateez the kings!
they went so hard they're unbelievable
메이크업 하시는분  너무 색조를 많이쓰셔서 좀 별로네요어디까지나 개인생각입니다
Ateez are always the best even when they are not trying hard
2:19 Jonghos growl?! It sounded a bit like san
ateez is the standard iktr 🔥🔥
LETS GOOOOOO
Their small acts of confidence, the smirks oh my god, that has me on my KNEES. ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION INDEED
It's me who's out of breath watching this performance
朴星和真的是全能的大哥
people should wake up and start to recognize and believe that ateez are literally the BEST performers of this generation.
Here after MAMA21 stage. They still are setting higher standards to live performance, topping themselves every time. They are in King of Kings special back at Immortal Songs let’s gooo
532.671
Esta joyita nunca se superará
Aun no lo supero!!!
Woah this still give me goosebumps everytime 🤧 didn't know which one better this stage or the one at fever PT.2 showcase 😭❤️
I'm  the only one seeing the resemblance between Rain and San🥰... Ateeeezz all the way

omfg, imagine the energy and chaos they’ll be exuding this dec 25, if this ain’t what u call ✨ultimate performers and kpop’s future✨ pls raise ur standard
gente, lo están viendo? ellos son los lideres de la 4ta generación <3
Did San pulled off a freakin' flag on that super unstable chair????
Keren banget si kalian
4th gen kings is an understatement, ATEEZ are more like kpop kings at this point
Wooyoung at 0:39 and Yeosang following afterwards…jeez, they are so attractive. They did so well with their parts, I love their voices. Yeosang’s voice always gives me warm feelings, he has a honey type of voice. I’m Yeosang biased so that part really killed me lol
GO VOTE FOR ATEEZ ON MAMA!! 10 Accounts per IP today is the last day we need to be in top 10 to win!!! PLEASE IT'S SO EASY!
Choi frickin San WTF? This guy never chase to amaze me. Jesus he is insane.He truly is iconic and I'm sure he will be a legend.
Did they win this one?
excuse me SIR?!  That's illegal 🥵
They are all incredible but I want to appreciate by man Seonghwa 🔥❤
Alguien más amo como pasó de Wooyoung a Yunho tan suave?!! 1:07
Mas personas necesitan verlo!!!
The only bad thing about this preformance is that Mingi is missing.
Ateez is the real performers.
this stage is a personal attack

All of their songs/albums and videos are connected to eachother and to their storyline! The members also have solo contents on their channel and many other stuff if you want to check out :)))
And that's ladies & gentlemen what ATEEZ is
1:49 this songhwa is deadly
Am I the only one that goes into Super STAN mode, starts rewatching everything, when we get closer to comeback time? I bet not lol its the best time of the year
senin kıymetini asla bilemediler...
i come back for this amazing performance
Yunho's "COME ON YEAH" was so cute.
Los covers de Ateez siempre son diferentes, son tan únicos, la mayoría siempre intenta hacer una copia exacta de una canción, Ateez sin embargo, nos da covers totalmente únicos.
rain looks so handsome btw
Wooyoung ❤️❤️
I have always been obsessed with these leather outfits and now we are getting MORE LEATHER OUTFITS!! ahhhh!
Looks very different watching the background now :)
ATEEZ COMEBACK 13.09
ATEEZ SOLO SE MERECE SER LLAMADO EL MEJOR ARTISTA, EL MAS PROFESIONAL Y DEDICADO DESPUES DE ESTA PRESENTACION, ESTE ES EL MEJOR COVER DE ITS RAINING Y CREO QUE ES INSUPERABLE.
"ssss, ahhh"
Ateez comeback announced !!
Ateez always gives goosebumps
This song makes me feel so happy and sad at the same time. The things Ari does with her music is magical
They look so intimidating in the beginning woah

thank you to Kingdom for making me a ult stan of ATEEZ. Their stage presence and musical versatility is unrivaled.
This performance gave me chills. Absolutely fantastic

Will I ever be over Ateez in leather outfits? The answer is no.
Next destination is Hayeoga （￣︶￣）↗
Ah yes, the performance that makes me lose my mind every time I watch it :D
너무 잘해 진짜 미쳤나…..
3:24 - 3:34 has me weak! Seonghwa and Jongho ❤️
nadie va a hablar del santo putazo que le metió yunho a la silla al final JAJAJAJJA
yeosang you're killing us   (and so is everyone else, i swear mass murder like this can't be good for their health)
Hahaha now I know why never will get a bf
After watching this for the 100th time I just realised that there are people playing the trumpet at the right side of the stage. They were singing 100% live and they were all so so stable!!

The outfits though >.<
Did anyone notice Yunho's belt dangling at 3:09 and when Jongho and Seonghwa was singing he bent down to fix it?
not san doing the cheeky little 'come hither' gesture at the beginning to THE rain???? HIS CONFIDENCE IS OFF THE CHARTS I LOVE THAT
I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH THEM EVEN MOREEE
Found yt reactors regarding this vid: “I need to watch this in my alone time “ >.<
코세글자라고 한게 왤케 웃기지 그렇게 부른단거 어디서 알게된걸까
I'm never gonna get over how good performers ATEEZ are

Can't beat Jongho's vocals !

절대 이길수 없는 애들이 있어... 끼와 재능을 타고난 애들.... 그리고, 죽어라 열심히 연습해서 실력을 계속 키우는 애들.... 잘난척 하지않고,  겸손하고 착한 애들.... 근데... 우리 아티스트가 이 세개를  다 가지고 있어.... 그러니, 반해 안반해... 실력도 있는데...애들이 맨날 몸이 부서져라 연습을 하고 잠도 안자고 무대를 해... 제발 적당히 하라고 해도 말을 안들어... 이런 애들을 어떻게 이겨.... 자기 스스로 만족하기 위해서 열심히 하는 아티스트는 누구도 못따라와... 자랑스러우면서도 안타깝고...사랑하면서도 슬프고.... 좀 적당히 좀 하셨음 싶다... 오래오래 보고싶다...
울 티즈들은 도대체 못하는게 뭘까… 모든 무대들 다 볼 때마다 너무 잘해서 소름끼치고 짜릿해ㅠㅠ 에이티즈 최고!!!!!!

My first time watch this performance and I think this song sound really hard to sing, but Ateez killed it WOW 🔥. And San "I believe I can fly" 😅
개성이란게넘쳐흐른다…. 이런애들이1군해야지
아니 안무 따는 거 보니까 그냥 진짜 쉽게 하던데- 아이돌 중에 천재느낌 아닌가요? 얘네는 무슨 액션영화 스턴트맨처럼 댄서팀보다 춤 잘추고 노래까지하고 기획력 쩔고.. 얘네 처음보고 인간 1.3 버전 같다고 신인류가 나왔다고 생각했음-
BRUH WHERE CAN I WATCH THIS EPISODE I REALLY WANNA SEE WHAT THE JUDGES HAVE TO SAY
this after black cat nero are my fav immortal songs stages from them
Jongho's growl * chef's kisses *
JONGHO'S VOCAL SO SATISFYING 🔥💕

how did they
The power they holds
0:34 1:10 정우영 사랑해
San @3:45 on that chair like WTF
Ateez are the standard
I've been wondering about this.. Why does their stage always become dark/dim during dance break? It's the same during Hayeoga performance.. Ateez's dance breaks are one of things that I really look forward in their performance, so I can't really enjoy it when it's dark :(
Y volví para ver a los reyes rompiendola en inmortal songs, me encantaaa
킹덤보고왔어요♡
Coming back here now and again because it's ATEEZ. They are the real cool.
After kingdom i'm still looking at this.

i'm here againnnnn
Ateez in all black is so cool and attractive<3
어떻게 이렇게 멋있는 애들을 다 데리고 왔을까 .. ㅠㅠ
This is what I say everytime  every member of ATEEZ is a main dancer . And that ain't lie .
ateez world domination
I searched through comments and not see one abt Wooyoung. He really good. His dancing is really sharp move, his stage presence is no joke, and his vocal is also on point.
I'm here after all the kingdom stages, leave the door open cover and their 3rd immortal songs win and this is still one of my fav ateez stages
Poor YunHo, I hope he fixed it in the end... once you see it, you can't UNSEE it 0:26, 0:29, 0:32-0:35, 0:59, 1:07, 1:30, 2:42   His dancing still top notch though, handled it so professionally :')
또 계속반복한다... 왜케 잘하는거죠...... 에이티즈 진짜 멋지네
레전드
Despite his earpiece is not in its proper place, he still managed to dance and not let it bother him too much but still fixing it.   A professional, Jung Yunho
WOOYOUNG QT!!!
니네가 아무리 화려한조명앞에서 춤을춰도 깡엔 안된다
Why every song they sing looks like their own song

Love it!!
sou fraca por eles vestidos assim, af
This was my jam, when I first got into kpop. ATEEZ updated it but kept it just as sexy. If they ever come back to Europe, I'm definitely watching them 🤩
Istg i love Hongjoong hair
What a great feast for my eyes, thank you for the meal ateez.
Jongho

Yunho always catches my eyes ..wow

It's raining

i need this performance in 4k hahahaha
Kings
So satisfying
Jongho deserves the attention for his voice and San come on man u want to break a leg love this performance
This is my 6th time back here. I'll come back again. So happy they could perform this number in front of Rain. San is a beast up there! Yunho sounds so clear! HJ adds a lot of freshness to the song. Wooyoung and Yeosang look so sensual yet strong in their roles too. Seonghwa is one of my many biases and he's just stunning as always. JH sounds excellent and he's always fun to watch when he does dance with a ton of energy.
ATEEZ INDEED
영화나 뮤지컬같은 그런 화려한 무대도 다 좋은데 난 솔직히 킹덤에서 모든 팀의 이런 아이돌답은 무대가 보고 싶었어... 나만 그런가?
Oh let the music control my bodyy

Wowwww I really like yeosang
Ateez is on another LEVEL
It's raining here we go again
congrats on your 3rd win KINGS!
Seniors that handpicked Ateez as their favourite:  1. RAIN (Immortal Songs) 2. Turbo i.e Kim JongKook (Immortal Songs) 3. Psy (Immortal Songs) 4. Lia Kim (Code Name is Ateez & Kingdom) 5. SuJu (Kingdom & this mv) 6. Rie Hata (Code Name is Ateez)   And the list continues  YG smiles at Wooyoung during MixNine. Bobby iKon smiles at their Kingdom performance. 2 hardest smiles and Ateez got it. YG artists approval means quality approval.   These kids are not playing around
Sorry for all the groups whose covred this song but no one can beat Kpop future .
LIVING for jongho's lower register and that growl omg
Atiny muerta  Tremendo stage
WHAT THEY DID WITH THOSE CHAIRS ARE INSANE THEYVE DONE IT SMOOTHLU
OMYGOSH ATEEZ 4TH GEN LEADERS

CHOI SAN
YEOSANG ATE THIS PERFORMANCE
Que arma mortal las expresiones faciales de Yeosang
I feel like I’m not getting enough of my daily dose of wooyoung in these videos. I need more up close camera view of him.
Ahhhhhh I literally screamed and replayed it fifty times before it processed but San why must you do this to my heart ❤️ (The chair scene)
I need this version on music platforms, JUST PUT ALL ATEEZ COVERS ON SPOTIFY I NEED THEM
why does it look like san is rain's son? i-
wait so are they in kingdom at the same time?
042,296
Sometimes San reminds me of Rain a little.  They both look like father and son ...
my favorite is the one in black
this is masterpiece especially that chair dance in the end! kudos to ateez!!!!
Someone tell this Ateez that they are 3 times winners of immortal songs
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
PERFEITOSS

i looove this performance so much
The other teams in Kingdom already close to 10mil after 1 day.  Atinys hit 10mil under 24 hours with Inception so we can def do this and more if we all pitch in. we ssrly have to stream like a cb.... Ateez x Atinys make 1 team.  Make more Whosfan accts too!! Ateez working nonstop for atinys so we should at least give back by voting and streaming. ty!
IMMORTAL SONGS TONIGHT HELLO
030,066
KANG YEOSANG????? those confidence ughhh, u killed it!
Hey again tinies !! Ikon and Stray Kids surpassed 1M vi3ws in less than 4hours from the release of the performances + their vi3ws were blocked for more than an hour , this should be enough to notify us about how serious the str34ming and the voting is gonna be this time so plz let's take it more seriously and give our all , we can do better if we work together, let's make this upcoming performance a new mv and do our best !!! GAJAAAAA
1:47 Omygosh Seonghwa that was such a rude attack

Atiny i just remembered there’s points on mv vi3ws for mama awards and the nominate start on october so at least on september fire works mv should reach more than 50M we just have 3 month to reach +50M let’s increase our daily increase and keep creating wf accs fighting have a nice day
ATEEZ POPULARITY: SLOWLY BUT SURELY
EVERY ATINY SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS EXIST
They are coming back again!!
Hi everyone ! I hope you are all having a nice day/night . I will come daily here till the next round of Kingdom . This upcoming round ( not the vocals one ) won't be easy especially for us . We all know that we are one of the smallest fandoms , and Ateez didn't feature any artist in their performance so this is their and our game now ! They already did their job so now it's our turn , please create more whosfan accounts and let's do a mass str34ming for the whole 3 days , not just during the last hours ,it will only cause taking down vi3ws , don't let the slow pace or the freezing discourage you please , it will happen for sure we know it but we need to keep going cuz once it starts counting again we will get them back , we are begging atiny , we MUST at least reach 4 or 5 millions , we need at least half the fandom to participate  , It's not impossible we can do it , gaja !
1m LO LOGRAMOS

Popular opinion says this is one of the most difficult songs to cover cause it's a masterpiece and Rain is so perfectionist, but Ateez never disappoints, they're hardworking and talented artists who always bring us unforgettable live performances.

I have only one wish::: want to see them in this black fashion once in real life< please>
Atiny CHANGE that mentality of giving your votes to the group that has the highest votes will benefit us, because it won't.  Points are distributed by % so giving your votes to our strong competitor to have a "better rank" will just give them more points and we'll get less no matter what we have to reach 500k accs and vote equally pllz and str3am the stage immediately the goal for 3 days 4M plz atiny no more rank low we just have last 3 stage on kd and it’s over
Fighting Atinys  Just need 50k
IM CHOKING ON MY WATER
Best song
00:53 The ajjuma face lives in my mind  sjsksjjsks
When i say they did it better  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1 million fighting
So far the best cover of this song
FAITIN
1:13  1:24 all focused on the dance while Yunho plays his part, and Hongjoong singing the whole song hahah
Atiny plz u should understand how is very very imp to ateez reach 500k before kd vote start i don’t know u guys if you are don’t care about ateez rank or wat plllz i requested u to not ignore and go create accs even if u hadw create plz plz go and create at least 15-20 accs today no matter how many u have already create more and donate to fanbases if u can’t vote no time to waste if 5k atiny create 20 accs we can reach asap plz no more 5th place pllllllzzzzz atiny
Yo atiny lets get it 1M
Here before 1MIL 🤚
Don't sleep on this performance,  st34am between the kd stages
저는 그냥 새로운 팬인데 벌써 공연을 너무 많이. 그리고 나는 그들이 정말로 우리 음악 산업의 다른 가수들과는 다른 그룹이라고 말할 수 있다. 그들은 더 이상 소품이 필요하지 않다. 왜냐하면 그들은 스스로 무엇이든 해낼 수 있기 때문이다. 더 많이 성공해주세요!
PLSS ITS SO CLOSE TO 1M
Nao puede serr,yo creo jamás superare esto ok
Everytime i watch their immortal song performances, I feel like a proud mom. ATEEZ is not a mainstream kpop group. Their charisma, passion, facial expression, live vocal all on another level

1:33 instrumental part of this song give me indian vibe 🤩
just immagine with me adding Mingi here ...😨
I love coming back to this video, because I really love their own "flavor" over this amazing song. Also if I absolutely had to pick my favorite Jongho highnote, it would be this one that starts at 3:21  It just resonates with me differently, y'know
Yall streaming fireworks while I'm still stuck on this performance Just kidding lol STAN ATEEZ FOR A GOOD LIFE😛
저는 BIGBANG과 ATEEZ의 두 그룹 만 있습니다.  그들은 최고 다.
Rewatching all these immortal songs performances by Ateez and I can see all the spoilers they incorporated in their covers for their next comeback. That bulnoriya wiggles got me like ehhhhhh
This is the first time since I can remember that I am absolutely speechless. Words can't describe how amazing this is. I wasn't an ateez fan before and I'm sorry I'm late but I'm completely, utterly an atiny now. My god 🤤🤤😌😌😯😯😯😯😯😯

Honestly this video is one of the reasons I became an atiny because I've watched many groups cover this song and this is by far the best one I've seen ❤️❤️

I still think its insane that ATEEZ is on this show 3 times (which means 3 different Artist/Theme) and won 2 of them. Like, for an idol group to be invited is rare enough, to be invited 3 Times, in the span of 2/3 months is just, Insane.
1m! Atiny c'mon!
Ateez superb
Iconic
LETS PUSH TO 1 MILLION ATINY
No me canso de verloTT
ICONIC
Has anyone noticed the dance movement at 2:06 ? Fireworks streamm

편곡 누가했냐... 비도 떨떠름하고 무대하는 애들도 찝찝했을거 같은데 와 진짜... 장르가 일관되지 않아서 대체 뭘 들려주고 싶어하는지 모르겠다. 원곡 파괴를 해도 너무 지나치네
hope my baby mingi will recover soon because ateez is only complete when 8 of them stand on the same stage. cant wait for kingdom and their comeback!
it's been almost a month and im still amazed at that steering move choreo san does in the beginning

ATEEZ ARE LEGENDARY
These boys have real star power
I feel this music arrangement maybe referring to ONF's of Kingdom.
Straight up kingsss
I AM ALWAYS PROUD OF THESE BOYS .. i mean they are really doing everything perfectly .. LOVE YOU MY EIGHT TALENTED MEN
ATINY ARE U READY FOR KINGDOM?

Kings ...what else can I say

Don’t forget to vote for ATEEZ on whosfan app tomorrow 8 pm KST let’s do it ATINY fighting!!
Ah.... here i am again
Yeosang, why you gotta have to do My heart like that..
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION si por
ATINY READ THIS IS IMPORTANT!  tomorrow on the 23rd at 8:15 PM KST will be the voting for KINGDOM, you have to create at least 30 accounts on WHOSFAN, use KakaoTalk to create them, it's easier, now listen, Ment said that YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR 3 GROUPS OBLIGATORILY, YOU CAN'T JUST VOTE FOR ATEEZ BECAUSE THE VOTE WILL NOT BE COUNT, so please think of who u will be giving your other 2 votes, i reccomend not to vote for the others 4th gen groups, they will not going to vote for ateez neither. Prepare your accounts before the live streaming because THE APP WILL CRASH, be patient and keep trying if u have problems to log in, let's win for the boys! If u have quentions i'm here :) (sorry for my english it's not my first language)
I always think the time of Codename Is Ateez. When the well known choreographers gave them a task for only 24 hours.  They also praised Ateez that time, and now. Time goes by, they grow up and one of the best kpop group in the industry.
erm WOW!!!
Yeah i still can get over this.... are u looking at yunho MY GOD.
Yeosang kill us all
Everyone watching this be like: 0:52 😭🤣
I love this so much from... Wooyong and Yeosang deep breathing exercises San yelling "Come on girl!" 0:54 and his chair handstand Yunho singing beautifully while giving his all during the choreo Seeongwha what you did here 1:49  Hongjoong wonderful rap and tribute scream to Rain Junho your flawless voice always giving me goosebumps Mingi angel hope they remake this with you present as well  ...I am positive Rain would be happy and pleased with this energetic rendition of his classic, sexy song.
IMPORTANT: KINGDOM!!!   ATINY kingdom introduction stage will start on february 23rd at 8pm kst and will air on mnet yt channel. There will be a global voting at 8:15pm kst to 9:15pm kst on whosfan. YOU NEED TO PREPARE MULTIPLE ACCOUNT (at the very least 10)!!!   VOTING: you will have 3 voting tickets per account that will be issued TODAY soon so make sure to take them IMMEDIATLY after and dont wait at the last minute cuz the app will be very laggy. You can vote for ateez ONCE with ONLY ONE voting ticket per acc. DONT VOTE FOR OTHER GROUPS WITH THE 2 REMAINING TICKETS. VOTE FOR ATEEZ ONLY!!! This will increase our chance of winning and you're not wasting the tickets cuz they will be gone at the of the voting   SUMMARY:   - 3 voting tickets per account - live voting on february 23rd from 8:15pm kst to 9:15pm kst - you can vote for ateez ONCE WITH ONLY 1 TICKET per account - DONT vote for other groups with the 2 remaining tickets - VOTE FOR ATEEZ ONLY

EU NÃO ACREDITO ? SÓ PODIA SER ELES ATEEZ , MAIS UMA VERSÃO DE IMMORTAL SONGS , AGORA COM RAINING DE RAIN . GENTE ESSES GAROTOS SÃO FANTÁSTICOS , NÃO EXISTE NADA QUE ELES NÃO POSSAM FAZER COVER . TUDO MUDA O RITMO , A COREOGRAFIA E A ENTONAÇÃO DAS VOZES . PARABÉNS MAIS UMA BELA APRESENTAÇÃO E UM ESPETÁCULO ÚNICO. ATEEZ VOCÊS AGORA SÃO OS REIS DO IMMORTAL SONG , BRASIL
THE WAY THEY ALL ATE THAT UP😌
They're such great performers. I have no words really, they're already perfect. Now it's up to the rest of the world to notice it.
It just keeps getting better the more you watch it how the hell
This song is so sexy 💕 I got my life certainly. Ateez fighting!!
Todavia no supero a yeosang
< 333
여러분들 에이티즈가 비의 레이니즘을 커버했다...??? 이건 무조건 봐야 되거든요....나 참 진짜 무대 정말 어메이징하다

i’m so proud of them :’)
ATEEZ comeback March 1st!
im waiting for mingi
Insuperable
Happy Valentine's Day Ateez and Atiny
Did you all enjoy todays performance?
Look at Yeosang shining like that 👀👄👀 told ya we won't survive it when he will get over his shyness  And Hongjoong gained so much more power ☠️ our man is UNSTOPPABLE
This is what jaywhypee thought he looked like when he was dancing to this song
Did anyone notice there is enough space between Hongjoong's and Seonghwa's chair for another one. Space for Mingi perhaps.
ATEEZ THE BEST
Eu tô é morta !
I would love to see some footage of them putting this choreography together
ATEEZ MAIS UMA VEZ SENDO DEFINIÇÃO DE PERFEIÇÃO .
우리가보이는가❤
don't forget to check out the TEASER of fever part 2 on the KQ Entertainment channel:)
I hope you'll make more special episodes like 2nd generation kpop singers like; Shinhwa, TVXQ, Wonder Girls, SNSD, Super Junior, Lee Hyori, Brown Eyed Girls, Bigbang, SHINee, FT Island, KARA, Epik High, SE7EN, 4minute, 2NE1 etc.   I wish those groups that has shaped kpop into what it is today won't be forgotten
Mingi 😢
Now they all more and more confident..

엥 개잘했는데??? 인트로부터 확 몰입됐음. 랩도 센스있고 편곡도 잘했고 중간 댄브도 멋있었고 마지막 프리즈까지. 진짜 가사내용처럼 음악 속에 팔다리 맡긴 거 같음. 춤을 진짜 잘추네...프리즈 의자잡아주는 사람없는데도 흔들림 없는 거 보고 눈을 의심함. 춤꾼들이네
Más, quiero más

ICONIC

ATEEZ's performance was so amazing that the salty stans of the other group covering this song got so pressed. As a matter of fact, didn't quite a number of fanatics get mad over ATEEZ covering certain popular songs before? LOL  Uh-oh. Can't stand ATEEZ's greatness, can they?  It's supposed to be a healthy competition, Folks. Deal with it. ATEEZ is too strong, wbk. Sorry not sorry.
Yunho supremacy
Omg 🥺🥺que lindo meninos 💜 Yunho você tava incrível 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💙💙🇧🇷💙💙

“literally don’t worry about other artists worry about ateez stream ateez breathe ateez make your entire self ateez” - kim hongjoong, 2020 (probably)
Im seeing some negativity on my timeline saying oh all these other cbs are happening we wont get 5 music show wins. Well news flash we wont if you think that way as you already put ateez up for failure we can definetly get ateez 5 music show wins if we work hard enough
no cuz,, im getting worried are yall actually collecting on voting apps every day and setting timers to keep track of ad resets like.. we need to stop this habit of getting on the same page and working together at the last second 🧍🏿
You know what our weaknesses is that we we are not constant, from all the voting and streaming we have done, ATINYs only join for a a day or two then drop out... we need all of you to stream for a week to enter the weekly charts so we can get the good amount of digital points
JONGHO’S GROWL OMG
에이티즈!!~ 늘 멋진 무대 보여줘서 감동♥ 에이티즈 짱짱!!! 건강한 모습으로 컴백 무대  기대해요~^^
The way I dropped all my favorite groups to be an ATEEZpopper. ATEEZ is just the best there is. What more when MG comes back? I'll lose my mind.
Rain said (ATEEZ the superstar of the next generation )u know ^^
アテズは雨を宣言します
i still can't stop watching this
I cant wait to see their powerful performances of kingdom!! This gonna be lit!
I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS, ESPECIALLY YUNHO'S PART-
Ateez is charging!! Atiny hold up your weapon!!
ATINY PRESENT 🖐️ Who's still here today ?
i'm sooo curious as to what the Korean comments are talking about lol
I honestly don't know how many times i've been wrecked by my own bias... Wooyoung just have that power
OMG so BIRIFOUL
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
THEY HAVE THE BEST PERFORMANCES, NEVER FAILS TO GIVE ME CHILS AND HYPE
KINGS

WHAAAA!!! GRABE DUDE!!!! AS IN GRABE GYUD BA!!! 😍😍😍😵😵😵
Wooyoung ending post sends  ACTION STAR VIBES and... . I LOVE IT!!!!!! 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Hongjoong: " STILL WANNA BE RAINED ON!!! "  I felt that Hongjoong-ah, me too 😎😎😎😌😌😌
Why do I see "why is nobody talking about..." comments every time???  C'mon ATINYS, they all did phenomenal! This performance is an ATEEZ TRADEMARK & I couldn't be anymore proud❤️
Views slowly ?
all 8 ateezers owned this stage but can we talk about yeosang 😱🔥
they literally ripped the stage apart
Jongho's growl oh god
don't forget -- ATEEZ SALARY LUPIN EPISODE 3 is up now on M2 :)
ALSO, MY DEAR ATINY, PIRATE KING IS SUPER DUPER CLOSE TO 30M. LET'S GET IT DONE TODAY, PLEASE (:
Now, how is everyone still alive after witnessing that? Uncle Austin ascended into heavens.
phew
직컴이 너무 탐네요.😁
Just woooooow
KINGS
No puedo, esto es mucho talento para mis ojos! Ateez son unos genios, los amo. <3
Jongho has lungs of steel, truly one of the best vocalists in the industry, I really don't know how he does it seeing how hard he dances, too
I love Bi Rain's genuine appreciation for the lads. What with him having his own agency, but calling another boy group superstars of the next generation, I think it's huge. We stan unbiased artists.
What is this, I'm dead now, sorry
ATEEZ COMEBACK 3/1
still here to watch it again!!😭
너희들은 정말 아름다운 우리나라의보물이다❤
still here to watch it again!!😭
ATEEZ COMEBACK ON MARCH 1ST
Just can't stop coming back
I thought this show only have a legend guest of k-music? Don't get me wrong, I like Rain but.. it's a bit strange. I miss the classic one
Fighting
im glad there seems to be more and more korean comments, hopefully that means ateez is getting bigger in korea too ❤️
I cannot stop watching us
WOAH... So many comments in Korean 🤩
케이팝의 미래 ,,,, 진짜 너무 잘해 말도 안 나온다 너무 자랑스러워 에이티즈 최고야
Ateez are so talented, they will do any other star's songs justice and bring their own feel and spin on it too.

Aşırı derecede bağımlılık yapıyor çok tehlikelisiniz Ateez beyler
San değil yer çekimine meydan okuyan mükemmel ötesi olağanüstü ve saçları kesinlikle siyah olan San diyeceksiniz
Birkaç yıl sonra buraya gelip duygulanacak ve gurur sçacağım
These immortal songs performances should really have fan cams. I could only imagine :)
MEU DEUS EU TENHO TANTO ORGULHO DELEEEEEEES!!!!!
It is good to see after a few years they finally got more exposure to SoKor audience especially in Immortal Song. I remember how they cried so hard at their first concert in Seoul last year. I hope knetz will start to recognize their talent.
Gidiyom
Bitti
Bitti yav
Ay bi duygulandım biçııız sahalara döndük st turlarını özlemişim bea

When ateez goes to immortal song, i had never heard the song before, but now i love all

YALL THE KOREAN COMMENTS HERE OUR BOYS FINALLY GETTING THE RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE!!
San❤️❤️
I just listened to the original few times and other groups covering this song and came back here,and should I tell u, it just sounds more EPIC. Ateez really is THAT group that can turn a cover song to a completelya new song which had their vibes! I cannot be more proud of them! And the way Rain himself approved them just made it better!
DON'T FORGET SALARY LUPIN LATER 8PM KST ON M2 CHANNEL :)
hmmmmm aaaaaahhhhh hmmmmm aaaaaahhhhh but i can't breathe :'( OMG
ATEEZ  did so well god bless them ~~

Me right now: 👁️👄👁️  after all the sensuality, impressively vocal and dance, Yeosang with black hair, Hongjoong's rap, San doing parkour, Rain doing a standing ovation for ATEEZ, being the winners and announcing the comeback
MAKCIK TUH FEFEELING SIAAA✋😭😭
Epic
The stage was stellar! Ooooh, will Ateez give us an "It's Raining" video with a Rain cameo as they did for "Black Cat Nero" and Jongkook? That would be amazing!
MUNDIAL MENTE TALENTOSOS AAA

습~하 습~하
Loving how YS is getting more and more parts gradually... My boy looks like a complete snack...
Honestly speaking. Whenever i Watch ANY video I try not to speak out my thoughts or make any sound ... But right when Yeosang came in with that move.. I lost it and actually said the f word.. Which I don't usually use. That's the impact.
얘두라 너무 멋있다... 우승도 대단하구우  정말 최고야 티즈ㅜㅜ

keşke pratik videosu gelse
ATEEZ'in her seferinde daha üst seviyeye çıkmasından korkmaya başladım, nasıl olabilir ki böyle bir şey? Kim bilir  Kingdom'da bizi neler bekliyor?
LEGAND AS ALWAYS T_T
오 지역제한 풀렸네요! 티즈레이닝 유튜브 영상 기다리고 있었다ㅋㅋ 4분짜리인데 한번 재생하면 끝이 안나는 무대 이거 맞네요맞어 👏👏 에이티즈 무대 - 말이 필요합니까 사랑합니다 다섯글자밖에ㅠㅠㅠㅠ♡♡ 그리고 KBS불명 제작진분들~ 에이티즈 섭외해서 이렇게 좋은 무대 남기게 해주신 거 감사해용~! 자주자주 섭외해주세영 >0<
It's Raining이 비님의 개성이 뚜렷해서 커버하기 어려운 곡이라고 생각했는데, 에이티즈가 커버한다고 하니까 걱정은 안되고 오히려 기대되더라- 역시나 좋은 무대 보여줬고, 멋졌고, 상탔고, 그냥 다 했고 ㅠ_ㅠ♡ 다치지 말구 쭉 잘 가자! 화이팅!!
에이티즈 짱

KING RAIN APPROVES HIS PRINCES TO DESERVE THE GLORY <3
ATEEZ's talent is so great, it's overwhelming. I love them so much! I've preordered all 3 versions of the album already though I know I won't really use them and just collect :)
Jongho growling, San defying gravity idk what is happening!
The inhale and exhale always gets me
KINGS
that was amazing! Rain himself standing up to applaud ateez's performance really says it all. Also , it's so nice to hear them all sing in a lower register , i was shocked! it gives them a more mature image, and it proves that they're all very skilled vocalists
Hum excuse me, Ateez... Is this legal?
i can’t even sit on a chair right and san managed to do THAT on a chair- bye 😭🤚
ALL ATINYS LISTEN UP!  When you are preordering ATEEZ new album, remember:  !!!  DO NOT BUY FROM MMT and BUY FROM KTOWN4U instead~!!!  Please keep that in mind, to get the best first week sales numbers~!
Amazing
Joong's undercut   Plz I'm dying

If I was there I would have been sitting with those 4 women fangirling over Ateez. Not only did they put on an absolutely amazing performance but they looked insanely hot in all that black leather.
Did someone watched the full episode??? Because when they received the trophy and Yunho asked for a hug .... I’m not crying.......
1:39 you dont understand, im addicted
Ateez Comeback March 1st ZERO:FEVER Part.2
Atiny, give a name to this trio 1:52
I remember being nervous when they had their first MAMA performance. They killed that, obviously. Then I was nervous when they covered a certain senior group. They killed that too. I've learned that Ateez never disappoints their fans. They are incredible!
Can ATEEZ please release a dance practice of this performance???
YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON YUNHO
Harikasınız bebeklerim
ATEEZ KINGS OF COVERS!!!!.
Just amazing!!!!
This lady on 0:52 is The MOOD!
They won again!
espectacular como siempre
Their expressions make the performance so lively!
Sigo impactada con esta presentacion ♡
Ateez breaking the stageeeee. You know, normal!!!
It's now just a playground for them. our boys are princes and are soon to be kings
0:52 same sis same 😂
Ateez this is really amazinggg!!!! Atinys let's work hard together and prepare for the upcoming comeback, kingdom, and others!!! Oohh and the kdrama too, can't wait for it >_< Fightinggg Ateez!!!!
those performances are making me even more excited for kingdom
They really have a very high chance of winning Kingdom
i cant believe they prepared for this while shooting for imitation, preparing for the comeback and maybe even something for kingdom, while giving us Universe content (with the photoshoot) + individual content  etctec (lmk if im forgetting something)  BUT YEAHH YALL STAN ATEEZ  STAN TALENT  on a side note- Kingdom global voting (live) is on 23 february 8pm kst. make sure to download whosfan app and be ready Atiny ,fighting!!! lets pull a 10th jan SMA for kingdom also!!(WE HAVE GOT ENGLISH SUBS)
should i not worry about them when they compete in Kingdom later?
Standing ovation, as they deserve!!
I absolutely love how Ateez put their full mind, soul and body into everything they do, it shows their true dedication as artists!!
I think they need to do less dance or more sutil dance instead of heavy moves because they can't with the vocal parts , like i believe is too much for the dance and it's not neccesary so much dance, is so intense . in my opinion they should balance it.  -And don't get me wrong, it's not that I am hating them , they put so much effort on it and they are improving but I feel that sometimes it is too much and that they can do less and do it well too uwu
Seonghwa's tongue can't be in his mouth, not for even a second /shakes head
ATEEZ KING'S
Just checking to see who is still alive after this!!!!! BECAUSE I THIS KILLED ME! NOT A BEAT WAS MISSED!!!! I LOVE IT!!
They said that they prepered this stage only in a couple of days cause they didn't have time!
0:52 lmao the face of this woman + the gesture at the end
ATEEZ make the best covers. Give some twists, put their original colours into them,  relate them to the storyline, or use them to reveal hints for their own comeback. We aren't only talking about locals here, coz they do it to Linkin Park's and other legends', too.  Seriously, who is doing it like them?  None.
They just groove the music..korea must supoort Ateez ..they are talented ..it's their 3rd  competition  in immortal &  got the trophy again...watching here in Jordan
watching this has already become my daily ritual
meet the leaders of the 4th generation: Jeong Yunho (0:04/1:09/2:10/3:06) [black hair] Choi San (0:31/0:53/1:53/2:27) [pink hair] Jung Wooyoung (0:34/2:40/3:43/4:03) [black hair with blonde highlights?]  Kang Yeosang (0:45/2:02) [black hair] Park Seonghwa (1:01/1:49/3:29) [gray hair] Choi Jongho (1:20/2:17/3:16/3:40) [red hair] Kim Hongjoong (2:44) [platinum hair]
ATEEZ did absolutely amazing here, there is no denying that, but kudos to everyone involved in changing up the music as well (it sounds awesome) and the background dancers + all staff who contributed to the process and the stage. It was perfect!
yeah perfect
Yesss what an amazing performance!!
How can anybody dislike this performance? Even if you aren’t a fan of Ateez you have to admit its epic.
ATEEZ COMEBACK SOON 🔜

Not fair Jongho, not fair!!! That growl at 2:19 caught me completely off guard, how dare he!!!! So rude, I can't believe he's done this...  Atiny, I believe we lost our sweet maknae in the end *sheds a tear *

I wish i live in Korea :"
Okay but black haired Yeosang is SUPERIOR
They are Ateez I know it's powerful.
Do you agree that Ateez sailed the way?
Immortal Kings

Can't believe we can see them this often in Immortal songs
WHEN THEIR PERFORMANCE ENDED I HAVE NEVER SHOUTED "PERIODTT" SO LOUD BEFORE
it’s 2021 and you still don’t stan ateez? that’s disappointing
STAN KINGS
Ateez 💙Atiny 💙
Yeah I'm so proud of them 🥺💙💙💙
ATEEZ LÍDERES DE LA CUARTA GENERACIÓN
i am going to appreciate the live wind instruments in the back <3 i love it!
Will I ever be able to stop thinking about this?   Probably not. I can't get over how amazing they are. Each of them has such a strong presence on stage but it never feels as though any of them are trying to overshadow or outshine. They really are a team.  San and Hongjoong are too much, they're so captivating. I can never take my eyes off either of them. Did anyone else feel like they were anticipating and waiting for Joong's verse the whole time???
Cooollll
Let's be honest this is not your first time watching this and won't be your last either
KINGS
next goal 400k asap plz
Wow, amazing performance.  I’m nervous and excited throughout their performance.  Ateez did very well.  Great performance and stable voice.  Did they sing live or was the singing pre-recorded?
Ateez performance always make me breathless.  I could only breathe easy after their performance.  Well done ATEEZ, congratulations 🎊🎉🍾  I’m one big proud ATINY!
YASSSSS KINGS

Let's stream atiny
i can't stop watching it TT so goood
I love coming back to this!!! They all did SO WELL I love how fluid their movements are, especially Wooyoung and Yunho, they really seemed to embody how water flows here, though I really don't know if that was intentional pff I just think it's so neat, and Hongjoong is really handsome and cute when he's singing along with Yunho's lines in the background ^-^
MA CHI COME LOROOOO
ATEEZ !! Anyone who watches them becomes ATINY look at the judges they love ATEEZ SO PROUD OF OUR BOYS
Imagine what their be like on Road To Kingdom, I mean the other groups as well.  Ateez: known for their performance and stage presence (legit a performance based group)   Straykids: known for having one of the best rap lines, and of course their three producers which allows them to work quicker.  The Boyz: Have u seen them on Road to Kingdom??? I don’t even have to explain.
Ateez is best
Why no one is talking about woosang :ssss ahhhh  They kill it

please after viewing this go to two different mv or videos and come back to this. if you view this over and over it freezes the views.
A WHOLE MASTERPIECE!!
THIS IS SO GOOD!!!
the views has been stuck at 299588 an hr now
yunho centre. thats it. that's the comment
Omg hongjoong's part is soo fresh and cool!
I'm back here again and again not only because for the v13w or anything. It's only because I'm so amazed by this performances and how they created their own style in this stage really gave me a satisfaction Everytime I see it their dance, vocal and stylish is perfect!
MY FAVESSSS
ATEEZ IMMORTAL KINGS!!!
jongho’s vocals just never fail to amaze me
GO TO 1M
ATEEZ COMEBACK 3/1
ATEEZ KINGS

Ateez 4th gen standard
Are the vi3ws stuck? Didnt this happen yesterday?
im still in shock
the views has been stuck a while
THEY ARE SO INSANE FOR THIS
Mr Mountain man defines gravity? Of course he does
ATEEZ is amazing !!!
Hongjoong looks like felix with this hairstyle o.o
Mu babies are so talented
ATEEZ KINGS
This is wow just next level art
I like how they stick up with original song's vibe ~
Immortal songs, the one show where Ateez appear every so often and give us a great cover and occasionaly go home with a nice trophy to add to the collection. That's what I call 4th gen king behaviour.
Me a stay: **has flashbacks**
Okay, everything brilliant as always, but did San jus-
This is too impressive for words. My screen melted.
300k vamosssss
LEGENDS
MASTERPIECE
Excuse me??? Did I just heard jungho growling????
99,588 WEON QUE PEDO SE ESTANCO CSM
He's not my bias but I can't explain why Seonghwa really caught my attention in this
hating on the 4rth generation leaders...... hmm can't relate......
Ateez World Domination
hongjoong's rap is so iconic
the fact that they're so stable while performing live??? ateez deserves this award so much!!
PQP ATEEZ NUNCA ERRA, AMO QUE AMO.
Since everyone else did a “why is nobody talking about?”  I’ll say why is nobody talking about Seonghwa’s vocal stability, center time, dancing, and not to mention the jumping over a chair thing. He’s so much more than just a visual with good facial expressions.
a legendary song from an absolute icon, reimagined by an up-and-coming world star!

Hongjoong sabe perfectamente cómo dominar el escenario, amo
omg they look like theyre having so much fun everytime they dance to the "its raining" part
0:28 San doing his Iconic HalaHala move
Sus presentaciones nunca decepcionan, son de lo mejor y su presencia en el escenario uuufff es de otro mundo.  Yeosang me tiene loca con ese look!!
They selected the sun as the background bc it represents ATEEZ (ATEEZ are as hot as the sun, maybe even hotter than it)😌🥴
Las personas que aún no los stanean ¿Están bien?
Alguien más lloró? :")
It's rare but occasionally I have seen Yeosang get possessed by a demon and this was one of those times... (Also as a side note his performance was EXCELLENT and you can tell how much he keeps improving with every performance, both with singing and dancing. I am so proud of him!!!! Way to go Yeosang!!!!)
I'M SCREAMING YEOSANG WTF 😭🔥
My mind is blown. They all did so good. Yeosang looks so confident and is eating up his parts, Jongho was so stable and he freaking g r o w l e d at us, Hongjoong absolutely killed his rap part
SÍ, ELLOS SON MIS IDOLOS
lptm que orgullosa me siento de ateez lloro

ive been ateez deprived for more than a month now bc school and i didn't even fuckin know they came on immortal songs again,,,,, bye
Yunho best vocal of the 4th gen 😌
as a CLOUD for 16 years i can say this made me tear up.....they did a great job not to mention that Rain is not the type to be easily impressed......BRAVO!!!
Hi Wooyoung ! I love you Wooyoung ! This is A CONFESSION ! Would you DATE ME ?!
i really love hongjoong's facial expressions,,, like hes so good,,,, sir ur hand in marriage pls
Fun fact:San always ignores gravity existence....
you see that at the end? "KPOP's Future, ATEEZ' Its Raining" kingshit bro
ssshhhh aaahhhhh
ARTE
0:52 TEYZE NAPION TEYZEEEE
That chair choreography was the cherry on top of this wonderful performance
Wooyoung 00:41 and yeosang 00:49 told us to take a deep breath before we need more oxygen untill they finish their performance
Wow, their talents rained down the stage. They’re such a talented group. The future of Kpop is in good hands 💪🏻
0:48 yeosang doing this part omgggg
😍😍
Everyone killed it! But Yunho really shined here And Jongho's little growl Yeosang and Seonghwaaa Wooyoung and San really powerful ! Hongjoong's rap break oml as iconic as his Nero Nero rap break! That's my boysss

ATEEZ DID A DANCE WITH CHAIRS WHY AM I SO HYPED ABOUT IT
Love ateez ♡♡♡♡♡♡
That ladies face when yeosang comes on... Same.. Same..
Me still not over nero and here they are with their 3rd stage
Ateez talentnya tuh gausah diragukan lagi
ATEEZ COMEBACK ON MARCH 1!!! STAY TUNE
ATEEZ PRESENT ❤️
IMMORTAL KINGS! THE KPOP REVOLUTION!
The only complaint I have is that they cut YEO’s dance to show us that beautiful lady 😔 But I  needed a reminder that is a variety show so !!!
Sayang aku semuaaaaaaaaa
that ajumma just......... what do I say! her expression!!!
I also noticed how woo's habit of looking at the floor while dancing and looking like he's overthinking hid moves lessened or am i just hallucinating..👁️👄👁️
Jongho's growl yes😩
Yeo and Woo's parts r so addicting
Ateez snatching both the meat and the trophy. Gosh.
OMG i'm so proud with you! i love you ATEEZ!
At this rate, i feel like i'm on overdose. This is just so bad for my hearteu  ㅜㅡㅜ
Seonghwa coming with those facial expressions
ATEEZ 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
Yeosang did great surprise tooo.....!!!
Ateez so cool waw
SAN!!!!!!!!
0:33 Yes, that's me. Absolutely me. Just sitting there. Smiling fondly.
Even the chairs fainted at the end!!
3:32 ok but this hongjoong hE&';LP#%??!
They’re seriously so fabulous. Just undeniably good.
I hope you all ready for this rollercoaster month that's coming ! Teasing almost everyday before the comeback uwu
The KINGS!!!!
So proud of them!!
I watched the original version and the past covers from diff groups and I could say this is the BEST It's raining cover ever!! It sets the bar so high!
Can't wait for their come-back!
hongjoong's part is FIREEEEEE
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT JONGHOS GROWL
Performing in front of the legend himself and receiving standing ovation and praise from the legend and also winning it.. ATEEZ deserves it.
The only missing piece is mingi. But they do beautiful as always regardless. Stage presense is always key with ATEEZ. ☺️
The kings !!
THIS IS WHY YA'LL NEED TO STAN ATEEZ!!!
wow this was really good
Bi ilvv udaan amidrmr bnshv!
LEADERS OF THE NEW GENERATION
great performance
I love that these fine gentlemen look so much in their element, so natural and effortless. I remember one of those reactors said charisma is not something that you could just fake or imitate.
<3<3<3<3 like
you know they slayed the stage real hard when the legend himself, RAIN gave a standing ovation
Whatever they do they just dominate the stage
NICE!

Pirate bad boys
Yeosang so sexy~
appreciation time for the performers
If only the 1.9 million followers on twt watched this at least twice, we would've hit our target in less than 24 hrs. T-T
Hongjoong's energy though?!! Our leader is out here just telling the industry how it's going to be: he said Ateez World Domination!
Let's atleast reach 300k in 24 hours lol
SAAAAAAN HOWWW?!
Not as good as Black cat Nero.
Every single atiny including me.... Smiling like idiots through out the whole video and feeling like a proud mother... Right fellow Atiny's

The Kingdom is part of their career, but not a peak or starting point. They go their own way, without turning from it, and will pass it with dignity and without listening to haters, envious people and ill-wishers! Ateez fighting! Atiny are always and forever will by your side!

I am a Stay and congratulations to atinys for this performance !! The best thing abt it was the way song was arranged !! It's raining is a legend ofcourse but to arrange it in such an interesting manner was amazing and all of the boys did justice singing and dancing wise !! The only thing I missed was "it's raining .. it's raining ... " In some sexy manner !! But may be my wish will be fulfilled in Kingdom !! Can't wait to see SKZ and ateez compete together !! It's gonna be win-win for all the k-pop fan girls like us !!
Rookies era : win No more rookie : still win  Yeokshi king
YUMMY DELICIOUS LOVE IS RAIN DOWN ON US GIRLS WOOOOOO
YASSS
I FEEL LIKE I CAN JUMP OFF A BUILDING FOR YEOSANG
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT JONGHO'S GROWL1!1!1!111!!!!!!
han mejorado muchísimo vocalmente, incluso las coreografías cada vez son más innovadoras. sigamos dando apoyo Atiny.
They can control the show.
Well ... THAT WAS FULL OF SPOILERS..
300K IN 24 HOURS LETS GO ATINYS
How do I breathe after this (inhale-exhale)
HONGJOONG'S RAP IS FIRE
kings.
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
yall let's reach 3M as fast as we can
rain's reaction at san's handstand was me but bigger reaction HAHAHA
keep str3aming atinys !! let's treat this as a practice for march 1 cb
Proud of u:(
Ateez being iconic as always!!!
NO THOUGHTS HEAD EMPTY JUST YEOSANG
Just speechless of how they performed
next: ateez & rain collab <3
4 hour againʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ
Me encantó :3 Cada día me sorprendo más son realmente increíbles, los amo demasiado <3
I love how Seonghwa unleash the inner beast whit his strong vocal. That's it!  And Jongho's little growling-like-tone!? God have mercy on me.
Don't get me wrong but if this is how they cover songs then they have no chance of winning Kingdom. I am an Atiny but looking at this in an unbiased opinion, i really think they need to do better.
Oh I see, black haired Yeosang comes with a lil attitude? Or is it bcuz of all the leather? Either way I'm here for it.
Atiny....u are ateez's destiny..! Where are you?????
why no one talk about seonghwa? he is amazing!
0:30 before I pass away please tell me Choi San isn't flirting with Rain.😫😭
They deserved the win, even  tho I didn't see other performances.. but ATEEZ performance is unmatched. Those are the rules, I didn't make em.
231.100
Maravillosos!!!! me gusto verlos bailar una canción de mi gran solista favorito Rain
Jongho came and ended our lives with those vocals!!!
0:52 this is me since last night
I don't know what to say but Ateez you are the best💙
KANG YEOSANG
We need fancams NOW!!!
Aaaaaah yeosang!!! I can do nothing except looking at him(  ૢ⁼̴̤̆ ꇴ ⁼̴̤̆ ૢ)~ෆ
I've never seen a group that rocks each and every single cover they do no matter how hard it is to pull of. After seeing Ateez's cover of SHINee's Sherlock I knew they could turn every genre into their own. I'm so glad that Immortal Songs keeps inviting them. They must be so proud to perform in front of their well respected senior. Truly 4th gen Kings of performance. Atiny will keep cheering for u. 에이티즈 화이팅! 힘내세요! 에이티니 loves you!
Atiny after this show:" I can't breathe"
.    Por si se me olvida verlo mañan otra vez
Stream ciipher tooo
I AM SO PROUD OF YEOSANG!!! HE GETS THE LINE AND SCENE TIME THAT HE DESERVE!!
LEGENDS
Even If we don’t get 3m v*ews in 2h hours please don’t stop streaming Then can we get it in another 24 hours? Of course so please don’t get discouraged
AMOOOOOOO MIS REYES
JONGHO, I GOT MY EYES ON YOU! All that talent. AAAAAHHHHHH + he's getting so much more handsome each day like really! T-T I love him so much! He growls and belts those high notes! OMG!!!!!
Ateez World Domination
Daddy Rain is so proud. I'm gonna cry! T-T
Hoongjoong: still wanna be rained on Atinys: crying is useful now
um why is nobody talking about that demon park seonghwa??? are we not going to discuss his masterful tongue movements at 1:49 and that 0:35 LIP BITE????
In the most recent Logbook, Kim Hongjoong said they would do their best to bring a performance that Atiny can enjoy and watch countless times. Do you hear that, Fellaz? ATEEZ want you to str3am. Where u at?
God I'm so proud of our boys!!! Congrats ATEEZ!!!!
LETS KEEP GOING GUYSS!!
It's  already 20hrs.. Only 220k v33ws?
de verdad espero con toda mi alma que no nos pase lo mismo con Kingdom): no estuvimos ni cerca de la meta
This is the latest sexy dance by Yeosang
Ateez 😍😍
WOOYOUNG OMG AND YEOSANG GET IT
Can’t fault their performance because they always give it 💯.. can’t say I’m a fan of the arrangement though I like parts of it. Boys fkn aced the vocals and performance as always. I expect no less from them 🙂
HELLOOO?!?!?  Talent after talent . Ateez have yet to disappoint me since the moment I began standing pred. They’ve grown soo much and gain so much talent after a short time too. This year is theirs
OUUUUU THEY IS EVIL FOR LETTING WOOYOUNG AND YEOSANG DO THAT PART OF THE SONG- THE ATTACK- I CANNOT RECOVER-
U know its over when Seonghwa brings out THE tongue!
Ateez always giving us the best
JESUS- I HAVE NO WORDS. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING-
I actually love this
I'm here again
seonghwa’s hair suits him so good 😭
Keep steaming guys
Are we not going to talk about how well the parts are equally distributed? Even down to the screen time ... fantastic division
KING BEHAVIOR
Sizi çok seviyorum ateezim
WHOEVER GAVE YEOSANG THOSE GLOVES, THANK YOU

the description 💀
ATEEZ NEVER FAILS 🔥🔥🔥
All of them did absolutely fantastic, but I feel that Yunho, Yeosang, and Wooyoung especially got some time to shine, which makes me happy!
This performance was so good that I forgot I had food in my hand 🤯
Ateez you truly are a group that has it all.  Yunho you were coming through bub and all the other members pulling in those vocals and the harmony hitting too.  Thank you for working so hard Ateez.  Someday you will have that fandom giving you 1000 percent effort.
Half of them are my age and yet I feel like a proud mom.
AYOO
Yeosang killed this!! He is shining and I'm absolutely loving his confidence! But im really sad to see most people appreciate him just cause of his hair. His performance was also spectacular
their vocal color is so preetttyyy especially if mingi was here too!
When I watch Ateez's performance, I was both amazed and crying. I can feel Ateez's seriousness in his stage action ｡･ﾟ･(ﾉД｀)･ﾟ･｡
i wonder if the guys laughed at this part 0:50 when it aired-  cause i did 💀 not out of negativity but it JUST CAUGHT ME OFF GAURD KSBSKAIIA
But like have your favorite kpop boy group named STRAYKIDS and ATEEZ covering this excat song...I'm dying 🤚🏼😭😭
Why is no one talking Yeosang?   THE BLACK HAIR THE VISUALS THE VOCALS   APPRECIATE YEOSANG   STAN ATEEZ 😝 DON'T FORGET TO STAN AND APPRECIATE YEOSANG
YEOSANG  LOOK AT HIM   my heart.....   Mom I'm in love
It's HALA HALA 2nd Anniversary today ATINY LETS STR3AM IN BETWEEN <3
So now we gonna have a cover of this with Rain just like we got Nero with jk😅😅😅 ateez will cb with rain 😂
☝🏻   .  Yes actually!
Wooyoung is my bias this period because of this “mmm ahhhh” 🥲🚶🏻‍♀️
Ateez 😍💓
Ateez 😍💓
Atiny please keep Str3aming!!!
Congrats, ATEEZ! Sannie, you are so talented and gorgeous, love you!
Yunho did amazing
Omg Hongjoong’s part!!!!!! I can’t breathe
San king of talents
HONGJOONG WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ATTACK ME LIKE THATTTT....!!
Yeosang is perfect omg he looks so good
now i wanna see a dance practice- but they're busy so not possible😭
Come on Seonghwa WOoOOooW !
ATEEZ SAILED THE WAY
I love you so much Choi Jongho !
Wooyoung really killed it !!
It’s their 2nd home period
Love ateez backup dancer..their energy are not joke
مره حلوين اهه تعبت
Just come to watch again and with slowmotion hit difrent  0:40
I never joked about idols eating cds but I think jongho feasts on them
why tf the vi3ws  are low ????  this deserves so much more recognition
Wooyoung and Yeosang inhaling/exhaling and going “mmm aahhh” with those body movements, along with Jongho’s growling is the sexiest thing I’ve witnessed. Brb I need to take some aspirin after watching this performance—
Ateez manager once told that San cant dance..and make San cry...BUT..finally the assumption are wrong  We can find the video at Ateez channel..Ateez member have talk about it
😍😍😍😍 my man Yunhoooo
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
they woke up and chose violence
Seeing Ateez's resent stages I am looking forward to them in Kingdom especially after this one because they don't use props much on stage if they can do that with chairs I am looking forward to a bigger stage set that comes with Kingdom performances
8 MAKES 1 TEAM LET'S GO BOISSSSS
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION 4TH GEN LEADERS ME THINKS
Ateez keren banget aaaaaa
I suggest you to listen to this performance with your earphones if you havent. and feel that passion feel every beats feel every breath then feeling blessed with heavenly live vocal
Yeosangie center!!!! You were so perfect, bby, I love you!!!! 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WHAT THIS IS SO GOOD??? WHAT??? Also San at the end WHAT WA THAT?? EXPLAIN
Watching this makes me so proud you can literally feel them making history with this performance
Don't play this video by replaying...  Watch other ateez videos in between..  Especially hala hala , today is 1st anniversary of hala hala....
I cannot believe they performed this in front of the Legend himself!!! Like wow Kings!
OH FRICK--- 🔥🔥🔥 ATEEZ WTH THIS IS TOO GOOD
ATEEZ is upgrading..  Our heart is DOWNGRADING.. Iss...aaahh..
wow congrats ateez
The king energy coming from this is unreal
Jognho vocal king
Y'all see how stable Yunho's voice is
Showstopping. Unbelievable. Beautiful. Outstanding. or whatever lady gaga said.
"Show Time"   - Kim HongJoong, 2021
Ateez, best boys
El yeosang pelí negro me hace daño 🤧
Günaydın atiny  :"( İzlenme çok az offff
I already don't know how many times iv'e watched this video,,,, I think I'm addicted
Ok, guys..... isn't everything supposed to be live on the immortal songs. I'm sure there was playback and lip sync at some parts. Is that allowed?
<3
216, 934
Every time i see this Yunho kill me. I can't with this manㅠㅠ
Lets the music control my body ~ ( ͡ _ ͡°)ﾉ⚲ ♫
this is what performance means.
I always think like, "omg this is best performance from Ateez." Then....a few day, " no.. this is best performance." That's happen again everyday. So, inclusion, Ateez always give me best performance again and again. I know, they will always giving us  best performanceʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ luvv ♡
The broken glass at the beginning, the dimensions shattered into 8? The green light when Hongjoongie leads. There must be other hints.
Sstt
yess jongho vocal king
MAHIHIMATAY NA KO POTA
I can't get enough of this perf
[🗣] ATINY  Just to be real for a sec. We have got to improve before comeback, in many areas.  Ateez will be up against some big names this CB, so we MUST put everything we have, into working hard for our boys!!  We KNOW you have it in you, so let's work as hard as possible 💪🏻

This is a blow-mind!! But I do wish that the switching could have been tighter to eliminate the horn section to the right. Also apart from Rain, the reactions from all those other "old farts" are so unnecessary. Those cut-aways should be replaced before posting video. We want to see the artistes performance - not aged celebrities - Rain of course being the exception because it is his track, he is still gorgeous, can still perform like a tiger and is ageless!
193,787
ATEEZ
ATEEZ SO HOT FOR WHAT
Did you see Hongjoong! OMG! He's so amazing. I love him so much!

No one: Absolutely no one:  ATEEZ: V O C A L S
This was a very very interesting approach to the song I liked it a lot Although i do feel Hongjoong's rap part didn't quite fit
I got so excited when the video started and I counted 8 people on the stage but it was all a lie. come back soon MINGI
Atinyyyyy fighting!!!!
4TH GENERATION LEADERS
Vamos Atiny... Mínimo 1M !!!!
I stopped breathing it’s so good
Yunho amazes me everytime he dances and manages to sing with a stable voice at the same time. This performance is just ✨chef's kiss✨
So rain is watching them cover his song XD Can anyone tell me what is this show?
And this is the group called by rain not just a superstar but the superstar of superstars y'all!. Omg! When I heard him saying that while watching it, I got goosebumps all over. I cannot thank him enough for recognizing such talent. Rain is a great senior who appreciates effort,passion,skills and most importantly he sees great future ahead for our boys by calling them a superstar of superstars just by seeing one amazing performance alone. I am beyond proud of our boys. And I'm super thankful to immortal songs for having our boys for the third time because we all know they did acknowledge greatness from our boys performances that's why they wanted more :) love this show! :) and congrats to our amazing boys for winning again! <3 :)  Ps. I am super speechless of San's performance here. Yeah right I know for sure he Will give his all but what I saw is beyond greatness. My god! This boy want us all dead atiny. He literally defied gravity! Amazing! :)
keep going atinys

When I was watching this show live, I felt so nervous waiting for Ateez's turn to perform, but when I saw this I realized I didn't have to be nervous. We can trust Ateez to give us an awesome performance no matter what.  So proud of my boys. Congrats on winning Immortal Songs a second time! Looking forward to your comeback on March 1st ^^

4GEN LEADERS! Jongho's highnotes as expected! . . Lol *win* is a great song that they made haha suits them!
Yeosang in LEATHER GLOVES - why did they believe that was okay. It’s already killing us that they are performing this song in leather outfits, but then the gloves. This is too much, they’re killing us.

Omg the way they literally write "Kpop's Future Ateez" at the End....!
Reading through the comments I realize no one is talking about my boy Jung wooyoung is it just me I feel like his dancing gotten better which is impossible because he was already killing the choreography, he absolutely crushed this his styling his hair beautiful and that ending but I'm also not going to ignore my boys yeosang and yunho like mind blown and the demon line killing it as usual and the vocal legend himself jongho it's crazy how he became a legend so young some people might not think so but for me I will always point out and remember his vocals they are going to take over the world I stand by these words. Also we miss you mingi you would have killed this but I am happy that you are taking time to get better and taking care of yourself
I just watched my own kids perform in a school musical tonight, then I came home and found this on my feed (FINALLY!!!)  and I have to admit that, tonight, I was more proud of being an Atiny than being the mother of my own children 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.  I've streamed this performance six times already, and I'm gonna watch it again right now.  (Did you see how Yunho really brought his game tonight?  Phenomenal!)
Yo soy metalera y nunca creí  enamorarme tanto de un grupo de k-pop,  pero Ateez, no es cualquier grupo, de verdad que me alegra seguir de cerca a estos chicos tan .talentosos
This was wow.
SAN YOU NEED TO CHILL
WOW KINGS ARE KILLING IT
Sorry but can someone tell me what this immortal songs thingy is😅
YEOSANG?!?!?!?!??!!? HE REALLY CHOSE VIolence
ATEEZ DON'T NEED IMMORTAL SONGS  IMMORTAL SONGS NEED ATEEZ

San, Jongho, Seonghwa, Yunho, Hongjoong, Wooyoung, Yeosang ... Dios mío no hay quien los pare Estoy orgullosa de ustedes chicos!
Congratulations on your Bonsang and this win, ATEEZ! You're finally getting all the recognition and awards that you so deserve. I love you so much! Mingi, I love and miss you so bad.

ATEEZ is a force that no group wants to reckon with honestly. They have an incredible dance style and music type...I love so many groups, Monsta X being my fav, but I gotta admit when I see talent and this group is gonna take #1 spot. If San can defy gravity then ATEEZ can definitely hold #1.

ATEEZ WILL NEVER STOP AMAZING ME and yeosang plz let my heart rest
Let's get 10 K comments for this masterpiece
ATEEZ REALLY TALKED THEIR ISHHH
Idk if it just me.... But i literally crying every time i saw ateez now.. Cuz they r working TOO HARD!! I'm happy but also worried... But seeing them here performing like its not a big deal working on kingdom, upcoming cb, drama, variety showS, personal content n they just slayed expression dancing singing rap everything!!! They r enjoying but hope they dont forget to take care of their health💞  N i always like how kq handle their artist, like this time they making seonghwa yunho  san n wooyoung more standout than hongjoong  jongho n yeosang(n mingi) from before💞 they literally out there telling ateez r 8... It makes me anticipating what their plans next🥰
If they win one more time they will be the group with the most wins on Immortal song alson with MMM and the fastest group to achieve this!
Wooyoung and yeaosang ruined my life.
Okay but who was that adorable, sweet looking little lady getting all funky and into it with the heavy breathing in the beginning? 😂 Great job, ATEEZ!
This performance is really sexy :D specially ummm aah part  Don't think I'm weird TT

every time i watch an ateez performance i'm reminded how no one can even remotely touch them like ??? they dominate the stage like no other, they're such a powerful group of all-rounders and i have literally never seen anyone who can come close to what they do. ateez 4th gen leaders wbk !
THAT WAS INSANE OMG... AND I WAS SO SHOCKED TO SEE RAIN WATCHING THEM COVER HIS SONG AND THE WAY HE APPLAUDED THEM??? HE WAS SO IMPRESSED, YOU COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE!😭 WAHHH, I AM SO PROUD OF ATEEZ!!! They really are the 4th generation leaders, no doubt! Their stage presence is really on another level. You can really see their passion for the stage. They always give it their all. SO PROUD OF ATEEZ!!! And congrats, guys, for winning TWICE on Immortal Songs!!! Y'ALL REALLY DESERVE SUCH A HUGE AWARD! WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU!!!!

Sizi çok seviyorum elimden geleni yapıyorum
Aquí es cuando digo que ATEEZ es el futuro del kpop. Me siento orgullosa de ser ATINY y de ver cómo cada día ganan más reconocimiento y cada día se convierten en lo que KQ Fellaz algún día soñó. Los quiero mucho chicos, tanto a ustedes como a ATINY  Pd: Aún no puedo con las líneas de Yeosang :) y mucho menos con San :/

ATEEZ, THE STAGE KILLERS, THE MONSTER PERFORMERS, THE PERFORMANCE MASTERS, THE KINGS!
Ateez!!!!!!!!
Мои талантливейшие дети тт тт самые лучшие умницы лучшие сыны
There's not enough HD to handle ATEEZ's talent
This performance led Ateez to be called superstars by legend of legends Rain. Ateez was also recognized by Kim Taewoo, one of the MCs who was a member of the immensely popular and influential 1st generation boygroup g.o.d. Love to see industry seniors recognizing the talent!
Ateez ateez ateez 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
did i just mistook hongjoong as mingi bec of the hairsyle? or did i just miss mingi so much? 🥺
Listen here, these guys are a gift from heaven..talented, kind, super hilarious, cute, hard working, loving, chaotic, insanely good looking, TALENTED, AMAZING..Spider-Man 2. Our boys WILL be world domination and all of us should be proud to be a day 1 ATINY. they deserve the WORLD. I love them and Atiny from the bottom of my heart. CANT WAIT FOR THIS BRIGHT BRIGHT FUTURE..LETS GOOOO
honestly, every member shined here. I am so proud of my boys. They really amaze me with everything they do. Atiny is so lucky
At the beginning of the show, they played Win by ATEEZ.  It's like a premonition. LOL.
Thank you to all the staff who made this performance possible! And thank you most of all to Ateez for absolutely killing it onstage!
San : I BELIEF I KEN FLY
Yeosang killing Atiny population all around the world ☠️
ATEEZ 4TH GENERATION LEADERS !!!!
Kings and thats on periodt 💅😌..
I mean like  •Yunho  getting lots of solo moments •jonghos growl and AMAZING VOCALS •san LITERALLY DEFIES  GRAVITY •hongjoongs undercut tho •Yeosang.. EVERYTHING about him  •Seonghwa has such stable vocals •wooyoung his face is so pretty *_-"STAN ATEEZ"-_*
Yeosang OMG
At this point, if ateez lose at kingdom its 100% our fault Bcs they won 2 times at immortal songs (a big show without fandom power)
Let's just say... Atinys are dead now...
IM SUCH A PROUD ATINY
I smell disrespect
THAT WAS AMAZING
keep moving atinyyy <3
THEY ATE IT UP IN EVERY SENSE OF THE PHRASE!!!!! NO CRUMBS
ateez being dancers, singers, visuals, entertainers, artists, actors, superstars.  so what's stopping you from stanning these talented men?

Rain itu role modelsnya Mingi. Saat Ateez bisa tampil dihadapan Rain langsung, Mingi nggak bisa ikut.  Pasti ada saat dimana nanti Mingi juga bisa tampil dihadapan Rain juga. Get well soon Mingi 🙂

We all know how Yeosang is shy. Nothing wrong with that. The group has a great balance of personalities but boy he comes alive when performing. The confidence is mind blowing.

Ateez is incredibly surprising, it is a super complete group, every time it surprises you with its presentations
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
The first 4th gens boy grup that win immoral songs and the only kpop boy groups in history that win immortal songs two times. No one is doing it like them. They're the standard of kpop and even Rain said it by himself. It's don't late to stan Ateez guys. Btw they,re having comebacks these 1/3/2021 please marks your calendar. Hope people will appreciate them and support them. They're starting from bottom as they're from small company. Even their company is trending at naver after this performance as knetz starts to open their eyes to them. Hope all of you can love them too
oh my gosh this performance is amazing. it blows my mind! ateez never fails to give us an outstanding stage! im so proud of them for pulling this off and for being the only boy group to win immortal songs twice! ateez fighting!
OK, Jongho, i wasn't going to praise you because i know that your voice is so good and i love you so much, but excuse me at 2:19 . That growl's attacking my soul and i need you to sing more like that because it's sexy ♡ Btw, I love the performance SO MUCH. I'm amazed to see Yeosang and Wooyoung get the fair amount in this song and i love how Yeosang is getting more confident these days. ♡♡♡♡♡
Edenary!! thank you so much! the arrangement of the song is so good! 1:57 rock and violin sounds are amazing :) KQ family is the best <3
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION

THIS SO FREAKING GOOD SKDBSKSBDKDBDLXN
If mingi was there, the moment they start dancing and singing, they already won, no need to wait until the end, just insert mingi 'FIX ON!' 🤭😂
KINGS OF KPOP END OF DISCUSSION
My ovaries exploded at the 1:01 and then again at 1:50 mark... who is this member? Lord help me for I have sinned just by looking at him. You don't even want to know what thoughts went through my head 🤣🤣🤣
I’m not worried about Ateez powers in Kingdom but I’m worried that they don’t have enough fans to vote for thm !! since kingdom is depending only on people voting  ;(
Anyway Ateez once again shows they are worthy for being called the standard of 4th gen idols performance
Congratulations ATEEZ! You guys are sooo  amazing, we are so proud of you.
Ateez решили нас добить:>) Как же нравится когда они в этом стиле одеты.....  Выдали все что можно: вокал, танец, рок, секс..... Ёсан.... Уён......аааа это супер группа.
25 minutes to 12 AM KST
I just think everyone is looking exceptionally sexy here, Especially Yeosang and Joong

This definitely showed off their versatility where they can make any performance their own. This gave off 2nd gen vibes (true to original source material) but ATEEZ blew it up with their style!

In San voice: I can't breath
Proud of ateez!
wow choi san.. I dont expect that chair things
King
I already know that ATEEZ is the best in this generation, but they're still so hungry to prove that they're IT. I'm so excited for what the future holds for these talented boys. Congratulations again on your Bonsang and this Immortal Songs win, ATEEZ! And Jongho, your vocals are truly remarkable. Those high notes and the way you sang them reminded me so much of my baby, Jung Dae-hyun! I was sobbing. Amazing young men!
I'm so happy everytime after watching Ateez's performances, they always make me so proud, they are always amazing, it's very satisfying to watch
But everyone did so well and shine through this with their own style. Will be looking forward to another Immortal stages if the opportunity arises again!
I can't believe everytime I watch something new from Ateez I'm more proud than before They never disappoint ya'll
So they won immortal song twice. I feel more proud everyday of the boys.. they deserve every honor in this world!!! ATEEZ DOMINATION
Atiny please str@1m where are you
I noticed the lighting colour is green n blue especially during hong joong part. Hehet. The colour for their comeback? Im amazed
Hongjoong s Rap Jongho s High notes !
mis reyes, dioses, son tan maravillosos!!
GOING SO HARD FOR WHAT
me dejaron sin palabras
Dance break +_+
Seonghwa's not so innocent tongue has it's own fandom. I'm the president💅
the coolest performers
I’ll be waiting for my Mingi and I’ll support my super talented Ateez
HOLY @#$&@&, they slayed this stage. I am ecstatic that they have covered one of my most favorite song from most favorite artist ever.
Harikasınız çocuklarım
Whoever suggested Ateez go on Immortal Songs was a genius!
THEY JUST KILLED IT, ATEEZ 4TH GEN LEADERS, ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION, ATEEZ SAILED THE WAY
Reyes
STABLE VOICE KINGS
And this is just the start!! Can not wait for kingdom they are going to be next level!!!
PLEASE STR34M PLEASE
Ateez😍👑👏
I absolutely LOVE EVERY SINGLE ATEEZ PERFORMANCE! My issue is the stage lighting. Are freaking laser lights necessary with the perfection on stage? Enhance, don’t detract from their dancing!
The king of 4th generation idol group
CHOI SAN...
Ateez best kpop GROUP
so good!!
i loveyouuuuuu ateez
Chi san guys remember this name, he will become a legend
This is an amazing performance! It showed off their natural charisma and we got to see all the members equally!  Everyone had their chance to shine!
JONGHO WHAT WAS THAT GROWL FOR????
84.032
their Synchronization🔥
No one: Me googling: How return to life after an ateez performance
Кабзда я умер
We all know they can do better with 8 members. But this performance itself is already insane. What if Mingi was there. OMG!! They totally will conquer Kingdom easily. They don’t need to use many props or hard dances to make this stage incredible.
Now Mingi is my bias,(get well soon) BUT.......everyone appearentl gets there turn to wreck me. At first it was Joong , and low key still is most of the time. Then San, then Jongho, then seonghwa, then Yunho But now i find myself being attacked by Yeosang, which i live for btw because i never thought he would attck me like this but that just shows that KQ and ATEEZ are doing sum right. Especially at the *sssssssssssss aaaahhhhhh* part. Wheew Chile. YEOSANG BIASES COME GET YALL MAN.
Chan    Yeosang           🤝 The breathing thing
ateez is not covering, COVER IS ATEEZING
I'm here to support my boys
이쯤되면 불명의 아들로 인정해주삼~!!  벌써2번째 우승~~짱티즈~♡♡
no bc who ever rearranged this song is an actual producer genius
0:35 allahım yok ben yaşamıyorum artık

Muhteşem, harika,  mükemmel, olağanüstü, dehşetverici bir performans 😳
Ateez r working hard and practicing give us this win but atiny can’t stream and give them at least 2M it’s tooo embarrassing really idk how we’re calling ateez world domination and their views always r soo low seriously
Amazing
2:22 YUNHO was also surprised with jongho's growl and I'm not listening to any other reasons ! Yunho smirked at Jongho's growl... I'm letting that matter sink ✊✊👁👄👁✊✊
Wow ateez they are the best
"They're the superstar of the next generation of superstars." - Rain
Breathtaking ! I M In Love
Dos veces que ganan ....congrats
San really said fck gravity
82.288
Amazing!!!
HELPMEH I CANT BREATHE RN 😭❤️❤️
No me canso de estar orgullosa .....
Ateez sailed the way
KANG YEOSANG !? 🥺😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Okay let’s talk about a few things...  Seonghwa u are attacking me with ur facial expressions and tongue   Wooyoung and Yeosang having so many more lines and have defo improved in their stage confidence. We don’t get to hear Yeosang’s voice that often so this was a pleasant and much appreciated surprise. I’m glad he’s getting more confident.  Jongho’s stable vocals never fail to disappoint, he is in my eyes one of the most talented and iconic kpop singers ever.  Yunho getting more centre time to showcase his dancing as he deserves, this song really suits him.  Hongjoong has so much energy it must be exhausting sometimes but he always pulls through and he was literally born to be on stage tbh all of Ateez were born to be on stage.   San — my god this man he has grown so much since their debut. Is no one gonna talk about him literally suspending himself in the air and embodying literal etherealness.  This man has my whole heart and his dancing is always insane.   Mingi my love I can’t wait until ur better and u perform w Ateez. Take ur time to heal and come back rested and healthy again.   Their vocals are so stable and their performance energy is incredible. I cannot wait to see them perform in KINGDOM.
Ateez are so amazing omg
They finished work, eat that stage and killed the performance....only Ateez
Celebrate for ateez
legends
Remember they are from KQ  though it's not a big company they deserved their 2nd win at immortal song as the first 4th gen grp to achieve it...aren't they the 4th Gen kings....?
LORD HAVE MERCY WHAT WAS THAT?? I AM SHOCKED JFKFPF
let's get 1M. Ateez deserves it.
4th generation kings, fighting!!!!!!!
OMG ı cant breath . ateez realy realy realy good
LEGAND
That ending with the chairs looks so cool :D

Ésto es una bofetada a todos los que dicen que ateez sólo tiene a Jongho como vocal, ateez tiene a ocho chicos talentosos capaces de cantar perfectamente como lo vimos aquí.
The man himself has approved of them well done ateez
Please str34m more atiny

KANG YEOSANG HITS DIFFERENT AND THAT'S ON PERIODT

and THATS on simping
Kings👑
راب هونق
they killed it again !!!
I want to admire how strong and stable Jongho's vocal is (as always ofc), how Yunho's voice and dancing are so smooth it spoils the ears, how georgeous and rudely sexy Seonghwa is, how cool our leader Hongjoong is for giving us his best rap version of this song, how awesome San's movement is especially the part of him trying to defied gravity, how Wooyoung's voice fits so much for this song and start it all so grandly...  But all in all, let me first gratefully thank Yeosang for gracing us his clear soothing voice and his long awaited short black hair. Thank you very much ❤  And also, Congratz for winning!
Even I'm late for 2 hours (I'm sorry because I need to do my tasks T.T) but here I am being amazed by Ateez's performance like always!!! Ateez world domination! Absolutely! <3
JONGHOOOOOOOOO
OH MY GOSHHHHHHHH OUR ATEEZ😭😭😭
Not at Rain falling in love with San... I mean same...
When ATEEZ saying that "we are another type ~ we are another babe... - THANXX" Theyre not lying .. each member has it own color! they are unique! their stage presence are no joke! their own color compliment each other that always makes their performance is out of words <3

ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
As an old K-poper who's one of the first K-pop song's that's Makes me became a K-poper until now is definitely Rain " it's Raining". And I really never thought that 4th generation can make this song sooo awesome in a different way. I love ATEEZ and this is definitely makes me more and more becoming a Proud Atiny and I believe this is just a start. Ateez world domination is no joke  ᕙ(͡°‿ ͡°)ᕗ

This Immortal Song was awesome, all performances were outstanding. Rain is the one who introduced me to kpop 13years ago, you can see that ATEEZ members are happy to perform in front of their legendary sunbae, they gave so much energy. Well done!
It's Raining? No, It's ATEEZ-ing!
Wooyoung how are you so beautiful?! How do you look so good in everything? And that hair oh my god...

Keep streaming atiny!! Fighting!!!
Let's achieve our goal
Gaja Atiny we need 3M vi3ws in 24h
hongjoong looks like Jackson wang-
I rlly love Ateez since their Mixnine stint. I rlly don't understand how they're generally called 4th Gen idols. I would've considered them 3.5 Gen. I mean who even started the 4th Gen wave and what's the basis? It's more appropriate for 2000s babies idols to claim that generation.
we need a studio version !
let’s do this atiny
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
Atinys remember 3M v in 24h Fighting

어떤  무대라든 에이티즈 넘 잘해요 섹시한 콘셉트도 잘 어울린다~
I actually thought they would do Rainism or It's Raining but I was actually worried when the teaser came out since It's Raining is really hard for idols to cover but YA'LL THEY SLAYED AND WON
I hope the whole of Korea wakes up to stanning Ateez!
IT'S ATEEZING
iim like wooyoung are you okey and then san and yeosang killing it omgggg to end this stan ateez
San, how was that even possible?
Люблю вас очень сильно сильно
They just killed the stage again as expected from our STAGE KILLER GROUP.  AND KANG YEOSANG, WTF?? We have saw him getting confident with every stage and I'm feeling like a proud mom. Same goes with Wooyoung . They both have improved so much since inception and they are finally shining on stage. And San that kick thing with chair?? Omg my heart just died for a sec. Seonghwa, Yunho, Jongho and Hongjoong nailed it as well. I'm still not over the fact that they won this show 2nd time.
УУУУ почему они такие чудесные???? Люблю этих мальчиков))))
ATEEZ 4TH GEN LEADERS  ATEEZ IMMORTAL KINGS  ATEEZ BEST PERFORMANCE GROUP  PERIOD 🤷🏻‍♀️

Ateez deserve this win
At the upcoming comeback lets give as many win as we can aiming for the world domination
KIM HONGJOONGGGG
With all the interest from korea, I'm sure ateez will burn every chart.  At this point, there's no return. The future that is awaiting for them is one bright~  After the bonsang, now they are getting the second award at immortal songs. Just the power they have.  Mingi, please take care of you, we are waiting for your return and when you are ready to come home, be sure that Ateez World Domination will be on your hands~  Atiny, thank you for all your hard work! Let's be prepared to show our power in the following days!

ATEEZ are doing great in every performance, Awards and the likes. But Man, when it is competition, they do not come to play.  The ones who should be worried for Kingdom are Atinys. Hope we are all ready to fully support these Immortal Kings.
I am not surprised someday Wooyoung has high notes in their songs though, his voice is very high, he can basically tops off very easily

three words: ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION
Personally, I think their parts are split up quite fairly.  Jongho : in charge of vocal  Hongjoong : in charge of rap  San : in charge of performance,  But out of all, I'm also glad that Yunho, Yeosang, Wooyoung n Seonghwa got some center parts time.
After 21 days of drought finally i see Wooyoung's face again
its the kings
A well deserved win for our ATEEZ! So proud of you, boys. You did super great and it's such a pleasing performance to watch. ATINY, our goals is 3M within 24 hour. Let's practice this for our upcoming comeback and so on! ❤️
I repeat and affirm once again ATEEZ WORLD DOMINATION !!!!!  also congrats for the 2nd win TT

They never lose the wow- factor, it always is as if you are getting to know their talent for the first time. They are that unique.  - "Ateez the true superstars amongst superstars."  Rain himself said it!

BEST PERFORMER
Log in onto your own account to avoid being mistaken as a bot. Do NOT mute YouTube, which means that if you’re busy with other thing else, use your computer and mute either the computer or the browser you’re using in the audio mixer. Do NOT use the replay button. It is NOT advised to use refresh as well. It’s better to re-watch the video after watching a few other videos. You can search for some short videos (like a couple of seconds) before going back to the MV you’re streaming. Better not use a playlist as well. Don’t skip the ads (even if it’s a 3 minute long vid which is literal torture) and as the MV starts, don’t skip a part of the video, and let it play without any interruption, make sure the volume is 50+ and like the MV. If you don’t do any of these your stream won’t count. Atinysssssss make sure to do the steps above. Happy streaming ATINY!
VAMOS VAMOS ATINY !!! A darlo todo !!!
