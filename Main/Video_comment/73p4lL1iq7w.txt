Makes you think you’re browsing their lineup from mid to full on lame
Me and my dad were cussing at each other looking for the remote 🤣
Best superbowl commercial ever
Larva
Bluey and Rosy
SBA
My friends mom was beaten black and blue over this commercial. They’re still “married”. We’re not friends anymore but I think about their family a lot. I’ll never forget that
Oh god no anything but Mr. And Mrs. Smith I beg of you please
>Randomly cause a spike in domestic violence for no reason Dangerously based
Apparently so many guys beat their girlfriends and wives on this day because of the commercial. Really showed how violent these men would get.
Man when my family was watching it we was so confused on who had the remote then we was so mad but when the game came back on we was like oh ok
lowkey woulda worked if i wasnt the football fanatic one. my dad saw this and i was holding the remote already know what's going on, and my dad asked "what are you doing" and i said "im changing it" and he said "but you love football"
This happened to me and there was no joke. I cannot watch any other shelves. I had to watch the Super Bowl or just wait and get back on the app right after the game. I immediately uninstalled.
This ad probably got someone to kill their spouse
Tubi
If you fell for this you're idiots and weren't actually watching in the first place or even know your TV
Sounds like a lot of women avoided  continuing to date a lot of red flags when their bf went crazy angry over this, blaming them. Thanks Tubi for teaching girls to get out of these toxic relationships...
Hey Tubi, when you play ads in spanish, your advertising to mostly illegal immigrants who basically have no money and really annoying a lot of people against your company.  It's unamerican and most mexican americans can speak English.
You guys should do this every year and it will still get so many people every time
The only reason this gave it away for me was because it said Super Bowl 57 lol
Ngl this ad was very well planned, see I owned Dish network at the time and thought someone hacked the TV 😂😂😂…can’t imagine how much blaming was going on
This commercial was so funny, I thought my sister changed. Thankfully, I pranked her so extremely good.
Tubis ads are becoming EXCESSIVE
This is still hilarious
The rise in DA because of this ass commercial 🤮
Andy Kaufman would be proud
I didn't watch 2023 superbowl, but this was all over the internet when it happened 😂
Tubi stream was fine, except a lot of ads. But hey, at least I don’t have to pay the subscription like with Paramount Plus or ESPN, right?
❤TUBI TUBI TUBI !!!!!!!!
Here during Superbowl LIX sharing this epic commercial with someone 😂
❤
Ooof that was a terribly sung song. Couldn't even understand half the words..and screeching the high notes! Hurt my ears
This is a good way to make less viewers
Don't watch 2025 super bowl on Tubi TV. It doesn't work. They'll show you pregame but then when the game comes on they'll pull the coverage. The screen doesn't work. You can hear the sound but you can't see anything
Its 2025...tubi app response to download is TUBI WONT WORK ON THIS DEVICE
"WHO THE FUCK CHANGED THE CHANNEL!!!!!!!"was said at every superbowl party 😂🤣
2 years ago I was like the only person at the bar I was not fooled I knew it was a tubi commercial
I never saw this or any Super Bowl ad last year since the Superbowl was not available on any of my services.  The NFL is finally wising up.  Maybe the academy awards will also.
I knew it was fake when the Tubi app interface moved that quick
My wife beat me over this ad and blamed me for it. I had to tell people at work that I fell down the stairs
😅😅😅
reminder that dv rates went up after this
This commercial single handily started the 2nd civil war in this country
I really faux with yall, them other ppl be hating 😂
Mr and Mrs smith
Tubi team, I really love your shows and movies, but what happened to the 'captions' section? Is there a glitch? Because today, when I tried to watch something in English and turn on the English subtitle, it just turned off even though I kept pressing on English subtitles
Tubi took all the Batman series off 😝
The funny part is I was planning on doing this for the Super Bowl
it hits different when you live alone
Thieves
My dad started accusing us all! I will always remember this commercial 😂😂
Bro someone went insane punched a wall and yelled at his girlfriend for this... she kept telling him it's a commercial but he wouldn't have it. Anyways they broke up over this 10 seconds commercial.
After seeing tubi commercials, who would want to subscribe?  No taste
this commercial ended so many relationships
Tubi, you guys play the same commercials too frequently.   I don't know if it's because, it's hard to get more ads or what. But, you could have three times the variety of commercials and the ads would still be put thoroughly into our minds.  Not that I'm saying to play commercials more frequently. I think right now, the frequency is perfect enough. It's not too much to push most people away.. but, seeing the same commercials over and over gets obnoxious, honestly.
We all fussed at our youth pastor who was equally confused
Put it  on  tubi
I literally thought someone anonymous from the darkweb took over my television, I completely froze for the time it showed lol
Imagine being at a bar and truly thinking a bartender would just casually click off and click on tubi and play mr and Mrs Smith lol. Idiots. You know there are q bunch of unique commercials.
Love Tubi
Cleber d
I had heard about this commercial but this is my first time seeing it after beign reminded of it. I heard that during superbowl DV numbers rise and last year was thwe worst year yet because of this commercial. It's something funny int he moment but knowing the reaction to just ruins the commercial for me.
The number of Domestic Violence cases increased drastically that night after this commercial was played. Pissed off boyfriends, husbands fathers blamed the channel switch on their wives girlfriends and children.
Tubi do you know your commercial caused an influx of domestic violence? During the superbowl women are more likely to experience DV. Surely someone on your team would catch this.  Do better
Similar in vain, in 1998, FedEx ran a commercial during Super Bowl XXXII that showed 30 seconds of color bars like there was a broadcast signal loss with a scroll on the bottom of the screen. It worked too well, as some local stations (including my own) thought there was an actual error with the broadcast and cut away with local news promos.
I just watched a video of this dude talking about this ad and how several dudes beat up their wives during that commercial because they really thought they changed the channel....
Just woe
Was this the reason why roku wanted users to sign an agreement not to sue them if they wanted to use roku?🤔
There's nothing wrong with the ad, the fault lies with the men that got so emotional they punched their girlfriends over it.
Men call women emotional then physically assault and/or yell at their wives over a commercial
I want to audition
Add more road rangers tubi
Oooh....
I simply love Tubi, because not only it’s free(which is the best part), but you have so many of my fav shows on there! I don’t know if anybody at Tubi will read & consider it, but if you do, my one wish is that someday you will please add the t.v., series called “Life Goes On” that was about Corky who had Down syndrome & in real life Chris Burke who played Corky also had Down syndrome. It would be really great to be able to see that series again. Anybody else here reading this also remember “Life Goes On?”

WTF
So much domestic abuse as a result
I woulda been so hard
yeah dont do that shit again or its on site
Had the whole squad confused
The person who is watching it on YouTube:You have no power here.
People without smart TVs:
These Guys Really Made History
They should have done an interruption this year too!
Some of y'all should force ur dad's/husbands into therapy.......
The fact that I have a Samsung TV that looks like this made it even worse 😂
This commercial destroyed families in America even more 💀
Tubi vs Pluto Tv which is better
This commercial had all of America trippin
Is the fact that I wasn't fooled when this first aired live because of the fact it was not broadcast in 59.94 frames per second and that and that only was the reason I knew it was not real weird?
this is insanely clever but at the same time fuck you for making me and my dad panic
Must’ve been drunk, cuz I don’t remember this happening.
Tubi was egregious for that onw
Nice try. But that commercial didn’t fool me
I thought we were being hacked
Bro while watching this during the Super Bowl I thought the tv could control itself
The most ridiculous ad of the Superbowl 🤣
genius advertising
The super bowl is known for creative commercials but this is one of the best I’ve seen
Just read a Reddit post where a girl’s boyfriend started yelling at her for changing the channel. She was explaining it was a commercial but he didn’t care. He then proceeded to punch a hole in the wall. When he figured out it was a commercial, he apologized awkwardly. But the girl felt unsafe so she left early the next morning and left him a breakup sticky note. So, good job weeding out the bad guys! That could’ve been turned on her in the future.
Domestic violence cases 📈
my mom was so mad she said "OH MY GOD WHO DID THAT"
You know somewhere some kid got in a massive amount of trouble from a parent because of this commercial.
The best part for me is, this is exactly what my friends TV looks like when you try to switch channels. And since we were watching it on his TV, we all started yelling at him vigorously
My brother-in-law about caught some hands when this ad played
I love TUbi !!!
I was sacrilegiously stoned when this happened and I reacted so rationally like “ok I guess we’re watching a movie now”
ppl ready to throw shit at ppl for this commercial is egregiously immature asf LMAOOO too grown
i beat the crap out of my dad and sent him to the hospital in critical condition cause i thought he sat on the remote haha whoops
😂😂
I was at the bathroom when this commercial happened and my family went wild. My face was like 😬
Tubi was Diabolical for this
Omg.... I am just searhcing up Superbowl Ads for this Upcoming one. I was at a SuperBowl party last year, and when this ad came on everyone freaked out thinking someone turned it off. I was laughing so hard
Ik at my watch party everyone scrambled for the remote once this started
A lot of violent spouses suddenly were revealed XD
Good gag!  I half way expect to get Rick Rolled when I go to Tubi now.  😄
I've had Tubi for a long time! 😂😂 This ad jolted everyone else into awareness. I expect we'll see a lot of copycats on the Tubi Ad! Nice job!!👏👏
i thought something happens to the streaming through At&t
This ranks right up there with Ford's Evil Sport Ka as one of the best commercials EVER.
(un)fun fact: domestic violence increases during major sporting events.
I would’ve lost my shit laughing at this live. 11/10 ad.
great spousal abuse simulator
It probably planned for a simple chuckle but unfortunately it was late in the game and was a nail biter so people were glued to the TV lol
Domestic violence increases by 40% during football season. Wonder how many women were abused thanks to this ad
I wonder how many drunk husbands beat their wives over this ad.
so many wives were beaten because of this ad, very good!
This literally caused break ups to happen
I had just traveled 15 minutes to troubleshoot a family member trying to figure out how get the tv working with streaming to get the Super Bowl showing for their party. I get it up and running and all the guests are praising me. Then this commercial comes on and all the guests collectively shout out “no!”
I came here because of the ab ad. I didn't even watch the superbowl😂😂😂
This was genius
When i saw this. The TV headline didn't even look like that. Yet i set fell for it
Where’s all the comments about the DV that happened due to this commercial??
This commercial caused me to divorce with my wife.
I knew it was fake bc of the suits Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen were wearing lol
That commercial caused chaos at my house
Wow
I’m sorry, but you’re ad cause me broke TV after that.
That day Tubi became the GOAT. I thought there was a ghost and I just sat there like "ooookkkkk", then I died of laughter. Now I'm a ghost
I hope the people and children who were harassed and assaulted during this commercial is better now! ❤
*This is a terrible ad and idea. All you’re gonna do is make everyone hate your shitty platform. Obviously it was attract a lot of attention but it will most certainly backfire. It’s sorta like thinking you can get a girl by being rude and disrespectful to her. All you are doing is deeply annoying football fans. Tubi can think it’s funny that people thought they were missing the superbowl but it’s very insulting to our intelligence. I have zero interest in Tubi as a result of this lame pathetic advertising.*
Such a great way to make the DV rates spike during the Superbowl, Good job Tubi
The only reason i would use tubi is that ad
Tuvi
Yall almost divided families with this one. GENIOUS
Both my mom and I were dead confused
This max fans so mad, they forget they don’t even have Tubi.
not everyone has this tv so why would people get scared or upset…bunch of idiots
This commercial legit shocked 1 country LOL
I loved the ad. It was great. Please do it again in the future
I literally though my tv was hacked...
I’d do it for free
Excellent!!!  A little like the roach on the TV that was done years ago.
Very clever
Tubi isn't faulty for it, but let's truly wish for the safety of those who happened to be with domestic abusers at the time of this happening. May they separate from those relationships and hopefully no one resulted injured or dead.
I love Tubi.
genius
This ad actually ended someone's relationship
Bro does the Super Bowl melt people's brains How did people not realize this was an ad?? 💀💀💀
Tubi may be responsible for the destruction of various sports bars
Commercial goes to show how f**** crazed and dumb ppl are over sports quite sad actually
Everyone in the room started to look to see if the remote was under them. Genius ad.
I was at a Super Bowl party with my friends and I thought my friend switched who was hosting this switched it to his Tubi account.
Greatest advertisement ever
Comments section is pure gold. Some people probably still think someone in the room sat on the remote.
I saw this in real time and it was great
This would never work at my house, tv is far too slow
Not gonna lie, that was very well played. Nicely done, Tubi, nicely done.
Watched this for ideas for me :)
Tubi really exposed the abusers out there
Tubi broke up families behind this...lol
I just feel sorry for all the bar staff that had the whole bar shouting and blaming them and probably, knowing sports fans, throwing drinks. But this ad did help some women realise that their boyfriends are crazy, because of their overreaction and break up with them so.
So you just stole the She Hulk gag and made it a commercial literally 0 effort
Too bad the Super Bowl wasn't scheduled for April 1st.  This would be the ultimate April Fool's joke.
I so won’t buy that service. Lol
So many kids and mothers were beat that day.
Tubi trolled millions of people
if you ever regret a mistake just know someone somewhere dumped their s/o over this
The people that made this commercial are literal menaces to society. This commercial single handedly nearly started a whole riot between people during the Super Bowl😭💀
The greatest worst ad ever
I saw it the first time and the TV I used to watch the Super Bowl did not have anything like that.
Imagine if this ad actually played the whole Mr & Ms Smith movie
tbh I'm glad for those people whose friendship, relations etc. were swiftly broken and discarded because of the commercial, cause people like to hide their red flags too much. Fly that shit high so ppl know to dip.
I’m convinced this ad got at least 100 people beaten up in the living room
Every bartender hates tubi now fyi
Men suck. This proves it
Lol people were talking about this commercial. I just heard about it now lol
this caused domestic violence lmaoo
The dislikes is crazy. And they’re definitely deleting comments exposing the truth.
All of America trying to find who sat on the remote during this commercial
Wow.  It's ironic that I had to watch an Ad before I watched the Ad😂
Damn I live in Scotland if only I could’ve seen this
whats even the point of this advert?? all it did was confuse people/make some people very angry
thanks for sending me to the hospital, tubi.
I knew it was fake cuz my TV can't change channels (apps) that way. 🫵💀
Bruh what the hell even is tubi? Is it really that popular that it caused tons of people to think they swapped to it by accident?
i was the one holding the remote during this…
I was at a sports bar when this happened, the place collectively let out the biggest groan ever lol
Mans fooled all of America
prolly my favorite superbowl ad yet
What a devious ad
My dad punched me in my right eye and broke my glasses, thanks alpt tubi
“You see, Perry the Platypus, that with the help of my evil Super Bowl Fakeoutinator, while everyone else is yelling at each other and trying to figure out what happened, and scrambling to find the remote, that they will not even notice that I have taken over the Tri-State Area! It’s foolproof, don’t you think?”
I thought my dog walked on the remote
I love this so much
NOT NICE!!
why mr and mrs smith tho
*Imagine all the friendships that were pulled apart for a split second because of this ad*
Domestic violence 🔺Lvl up!                                 🔺
Bro my Dad and Uncle thought it was Me because I last had the remote?
you started an entire war inside my house i’m just saying.
This ad scared my dad thinking someone was using the remote 😂
Good ad cause of how it exposed a lot of really violent domestic abusers
Gotti
Tubi wtf
Oh boy my CRT tv was drunk that night
My wife got a black eye cuz of yall smh
wonder how many people died from drunk dads because of this
Bold move to include the logos of your competitors in your ad
Make a commercial of the year award so you can win one
imagine how much wifes and children got molested because of this
Steals a youtubers entire video section Puts a troll advert to destroy families  Refuses to elaborate further
This ad made the whole nation panic xD
What about the people who don't Have a Smart TV 💀💀💀
genius ad, Tubi Really said "we do a little trolling"
OMG. I REMEMBER THIS SO WELL BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS GOING BAT SHIT CRAZY OVER WHO SAT ON THE REMOTE. 😭
Honestly I'd rather see Mr and Mrs Smith than this boring ass game 😂
Dad, how did world war 3 start?
Whoever thought of this commercial is an agent of chaos who deserves a raise. I love it!
Some child and mother out there probably got beaten to death over this ad
Best trolling ever. Hands down.
The acting was pretty bad honestly.
This ad definitely got some people hospitalized
They spent millions just to troll and I love it, definitely reminded me to use Tubi!
we do a little bit of trolling
How much in damages did this cost
I don’t watch the super bowl
Quite possibly the greatest ad in Super Bowl history. Genius marketing
Non smart tv user:  Yep.. it's a commercial!
There anyone here that didn’t get tricked by this commercial??? I mean cmon it didnt look real😂
I thought my sister was jacking around from upstairs
They even had prime video and other streaming logos on the interfaxe
This was one of the best ads I’ve ever seen.. and I’m never using Tubi after this 😂
I looked for this because of the Reddit post where a woman broke up with her bf because he screamed at her and called her names and punched a hole in the wall over this commercial… men are insane.
can somene tell me what the fuck happened i have no idea
😂 awesome
I have seen tubi ads to many times now, I feel like they are taking over
I could tell it was a commercial because the camera didn’t look like Fox quality.
As funny as this commercial is, the effects are terrifying
I heard that a girl broke up with her boyfriend because he punched a hole in the wall and yelled abuse at her when this ad came on, thinking she was the one doing it.
Nice talking beautiful video
How many bar fights did this commercial start? 😂
This was the greatest troll in history😂😂
Noooooo! That would be soooooooo annoying!
This has been the best commercial of all time!! 🤣🤣🤣 every household/restaurant/venue on this nation went crazy over who TF changed the channel!!!
Very nice
That one mfer with an old ass TV just wondering how his got upgraded to a smart TV💀
Out of all the shows they could’ve picked for this troll they went with Mr and Mrs. Smith 💀
Nice and good
The historical was makes here
A masterpiece of the decade
Who da fuck sitting on the remote
Tubi went from "what the fuck is Tubi" to a household name overnight. This commercial will probably be studied in marketing textbooks.
👍
That’s what you want in marketing lol, nice.
Lawd I thought someone was in my house. Y’all wrong for that! 😂
You idiots need to stop buying the same TVs
Mann when this ad came on, we all looked at each other, lifting our butts and hands asking, "Who's got the remote?" Well-played, Tubi. Well played.
Marketing team deserves a raise
The amount of trust issues my family had when this ad came on, lol. Good one, Tubi.
Men will literally explode from a 15 second commercial trolling them, and lash out on their own family, than go to management therapy. 🤭
😂😂 give whatever team who thought of this a 40% raise
Good job on upping domestic violence.
This commercial alone had the whole country looking for the remote. #1 Strat.
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
Tubi inciting national violence is something I wasn't expecting but it's eye opening and concerning all in the name of an AD
Great job
Good jop
Lol I swear I thought one of my kids had the remote
Nice
Interesting video.  Excellent advertisement.😄
Was watching the game at my buddies house and this ad had us dumbfounded🤣🤣 everyone yelling at each other for a good 2 min
Still better than the rabbit ads they were doing
“Social media users quickly began sharing examples of how scary the situation turned as some partners, parents, restaurant-goers, etc. instantly flew into a rage because they believed someone had touched the remote. Most videos seemed to depict men flying into a rage and instantly taking out their anger on their wives or children. Some reactions that users shared because they thought they were funny were actually very scary and shocking to see.”
We all really thought someone had sat on the remote, until my lovely wife pointed out that we did not have that channel… 🤣🤣🤣
LOLOL!!!
Thumbs up
They took a real chance and I hope no abusive person took it out on their SO.
After reading these comments. Y’all seriously need to seek medical attention in lieu of therapy or psychiatry. This is nuts. People are going overboard during a football game. I feel sorry for everyone that had to deal with domestic violence during the Super Bowl or on a daily basis.
I was streaming the game from my laptop and when this ad appeared, my friend legit thought someone hacked it. I too got concerned for a hot sec 😅
Quiet everyone it’s back on Hey hey who changing the channel   Wait it’s a prank so I just yelled on the top on my lungs for nothing
This genuinely made me think my tv was hacked I literally had a heart attack and turned off my WiFi out of panic.
This ad is complete gold! 🤣
This commercial brought out people’s true colors
Nice
🤣I looked this up, knew what I was looking at and STILL thought my phone went glitchy lmao… well done.  😂
Tubi not going lie but you had us all thinking someone was messing with the tv
I almost whooped someone ass
Evil, but genius.
This ad almost sparked WWIII
I didn't realize how much this ad fucked with everyone because my autistic self immediately noticed that they were wearing different clothes
Ngl the ad freaked me tf out at first and I was blaming my dad and grandfather for sitting on the remote because I thought it actually went on to tubi so it’s a pretty good ad because it’s very attention grabbing especially for a big audience like for everyone watching the Super Bowl so great job with that tubi!!
This commercial ended relationships lol
This shit was so effective, people may have actually been assaulted in the confusion and subsequent blame game
this is evil 😭😭
Bruh I seriously thought my mom's fiance changed the channel!!! I was PISSED 😂😂
How were people fooled over this? Lol
How to get absolutely NOBODY to want your product 😂
Hehe it's so funny
Somebody on Facebook said they almost whoop their kids because of this ad 😂😂😂
This is one of the best ads I've EVER seen, period. It completely did what it was supposed to, grab the attention of people in an unexpected way.
Yo! I was like WTF 🤣🤣🤣
Knew it was fake cause we don’t have Tubi 😂
Tubi single handedly trolled thousands of people at home and at bars. Genius, best ad ever.
I have some hatred for this advertisement, but it's a brilliant idea that bamboozled millions of people watching.
Ngl I thought somebody changed the channel
I was the only one who knew it was fake because the interface was different but that didn't stop my family from all going at each other's throat while I tried to calm them down saying it's an ad
HES IN THE WALLS
My observation and awareness level is higher than most obviously, because I knew it wasn't real from the cinematic look of the the commentators and backdrop. Just not real enough, but great effort. Fooled the average viewers.
Trolling level: hall of fame
Whoever came up with this commercial, within tubi, really wants to the world burn. 😂😂😂
Someone is a fan of Andy Kaufman.
🤣🤣🤣 the only good one I seen
We weren’t even watching on a smart TV, yet my family was still fooled lmao
So many kids got their asses beat across the nation because of this commercial l
This commercial is dogshit. I ended up turning the Tv off and on again so I missed the whole thing.
I had a heart attack knowing that the home screen was identical to Samsung's smart hub and the fact that I was watching it on a Samsung tv made me say "who tf got the remote?"
There's a post on Reddit this couple was watching the Superbowl and the commercial came on and her now ex got so angry at her and blamed her for changing the channel that he punched a hole in the wall....
This interface joke caused a spike in domestic violence. Humanity is doomed.
This cost $7M?
I’ve read multiple stories of bar tenders being attacked by customers who thought they had changed the channel, taking glasses to the face and everything
These people can make yall kill each other if they wanted to
Can’t believe people fell for the sounds and graphics of this …
My cousin screams at the bar: What the fuck! 🤣
Funny thing is I never even noticed this commercial 🤷🏾‍♂️😭🤣
Good on u tubi. Gave violent abusers a reason to beat their wives. Worst ad i seen and i hate football
Mann when this ad came on, we all looked at each other, lifting our butts and hands asking, "Who's got the remote?" Well-played, Tubi. Well played.
Nice
whoever came up with this ad deserves a raise.
This might be easily one of the best commercial ever... had a whole nation like yoooo wtf
Fuck Tubi.  They made so many people reacted negatively towards each other during this prank.
Abominable act that caused conflict and violence in some households…..
I thought it was a neighbor changing the channel.
Who else is here from the reddit post of the same exact Tubi ad
I heard this AD caused alot of domestic violence.   I'm a dude and I don't watch sports, so I don't get how people can get so sensitive and abusive over something like that, I hope those people in abusive relationships leave and save themselves
This commercial literally helped someone see 🚩 in their boyfriend when he got irrationality angry and violent she broke up with him for it. So kudos to that!
Snicker...Eagles fans has been playing this nonstop
That's hilarious 😂 😃 😄 😁 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Y’all broke up some relationships with this wow
Good
Good
I bet a lot of men screamed at their wives when this happened.
That only didn’t fool me for 2 reasons: 1) that menu looked nothing like my smart TVs menu  2) my family doesn’t even have a tubi account
Yeah uh there was a Reddit post where allegedly a woman almost got beat for this commercial
I came to see this commercial (I didn't catch it on Sunday) because I just read on twitter that a girl broke up with her boyfriend over his violent reaction thinking she was changing the tv on purpose, revealing he had anger issues. woah.
When me and my friends saw this ad we were all cursing and screaming at the tv and after we found out it was an ad we all hated Tubi since than.
This ad ended relationships
Yeah this would make me switch back to pirating tv
No one even knew it was a commercial at the bar I was at, they was booing lol.
Came here because of the videos of all the men beating up their wife's, kids, and destroying property
I was like ayyye I love Mr and Mrs Smith!
YALL ARE SO SICK FOR THIS
I keep forgetting people watch broadcast tv. This commercial is wild ❤
The way that it even LOOKED fake and psycho men still got upset
tubi is evil asf for this 💀💀💀
I'm sure all the domestic violence that broke out because of this was worth the lulz
Teeth were lost because of this
Tubi, you guys are great with this ad. Just like Comedy Central prank America with the April fools episode from South Park.
Ok but this is hilarious. Although I only heard about this after seeing how many people broke up because this showed people’s true colors. So good Ad by Tubi for being funny AND outing assholes
It’s just a ball guys
Not so funny when the drunk violent men snap due to a 15 second time out and chose to n
Whoever came up with that ad. Tubi you need to give them a huge promotion!!
😆
Everyone saying this was genuis forgetting that many people were fully attacked over this, like verbally and physically abused. Tubi needs to apologize and hand their award to the runner up
So funny seeing all these meatheads get pissed off over this, the meatheads that supposedly love football but didn't realize that the lighting looked nothing like the actual broadcast
So this is why the girl on Reddit said her boyfriend was angry about. Yeah, girl, dump him.
Absolutely amazing marketing !
Ad was superior!!! So funny and just good!
I read on Reddit that some guy put his fist through a wall and screamed at his gf over this and now she’s running away from him. Good for her
Clever in theory, but Tubi should remember their target audience. A bunch of dumb old guys with anger issues who haven't a clue how technology works and are far too quick to violence.
My TV is too old for this shit so I was not fooled
Reddit post of a girl who saw red flags brought me here.
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER SUPERBOWL AD GREATER THAN THIS!!!
So. This was a pretty vile stunt.
Y'all are simple if this ad legit fooled you. 😂
wasnt aware of tubi until this ad. not gonna lie - made me register. well played!
Not saying it’s Tubi’s fault at all but someone was a victim of DV when this ad confused and angered their partner. Scary and I wish more ppl would stop and reflect on what’s most important before resorting to mental and physical violence towards the ppl in their lives.
Oh...so this is the commercial which made a girl (23F) broke up with her boyfriend (25M).
I didn’t watch the Super Bowl but I had to see what the hype was about w tubi
Looking forward to seeing Tubi and Fox heavily fined by the FCC for this deceptive disruption. Not funny.
I'm probably one of very few people that didn't/wouldn't fall for this. for starters I didnt watch the Superbowl this year. Second my TV isnt hooked up to the internet, and the menu on my tv looks completly different when it is.
On one hand, genius marketing.  On the other, you DO know domestic abuse skyrockets during Super Bowl, right?
Genius lol
Yo a guy got dumped by his gf because of his overreaction of this ad lmao.
W
Nah this is fucked up. I don’t even want to imagine how many people were physically assaulted bc of this dumbass commercial.
The amount of tick-tock videos where I seen women crying because this commercial made their man abuse them is ridiculous
Sad thinking about the domestic violence disputes this may have caused
Jokes on you Tubi, my TV’s 9 years old and doesn’t have that menu. No chaos here.
Is anyone else here from the r/offmychest post?
Sounds like more than a couple women got out of toxic relationships after being screamed at by their bfs over a 15 sec commercial  Good for them
I've been using Tubi from time to time. Usually they've got stuff that nobody else has and their library is eclectic to say the least! It's free to join and hopefully they will stay that way. Nice to know more people know about it but I feel cool knowing I knew about it before it was cool!
Broo I hid under my blanket cuz I didn’t know what to do 😅
Seeing videos on Tik Tok about the number of men, already angry about the game, attacking their women thinking they were changing the channel.
I have heard Some couples broke up over this ad lmao
My mom yelled at me for changing the channel during the Superbowl but had no clue what she was talking about because fell asleep in my room. Then she realized it was this commercial lol
I thought my tv was haunted
I WAS AT A RESTAURANT WITH MY MOM AND SOME FRIENDS WHEN WE SAW THIS AND WE WERE LIKE WTF?? AND OTHER PEOPLE WERE LIKE BRUH PUT THE GAME BACK ON 😂 Y'all got us good lol
I still have cable... Didn't get me but well done
This was probably the greatest commercial ever produced in modern times.
Great way to start a bar fight
Which one you kids got the remote
Outside the box marketing. Brilliant
Apparently this caused a break up in one case.  Stupid ass commercial.
yall need to calm down the superbowl is not that serious bffr
I’m a bartender an got 4 drinks threw at me for this. (Includes the glass they was in an left me with 12 stitches). Thank tubi
Note to self: NEVER. EVER. subscribe to Tubi. My wife got a call from her mother and both her and I thought she sat on the Roku remote. GO ROKU!
To think this caused a break up over the boyfriend getting furious
We don't deserve tubi , Yet here it is . fucking legend !
Dis shiit was gold 😭😭😭
My best friend got yelled at by her parents and broke down crying because they thought she did this.
Domestic violence went slightly up the minute this ad came on.
Well played Tubi! Everyone in the livingroom froze for almost 2 minutes pondering about where they placed the remote 🤯
oooh... the shade to netflix... nyahahaha
The amount of domestic violence this commercial caused is staggering
As someone who works in marketing I can’t imagine the amount of meetings all you went through for 15 seconds. Bravo to the marketing team! 👏
Imagine if She Hulk did this again but with Tubi
this commerical caused my aubsive dad to beat the shit out of me because he thought i was changing the channel! thank you tubi! genius marketing!!
I didn't know what the hell was going on. Thought maybe it was a poorly placed advertisement or something.
Was I the only one who saw it was a fake broadcast before the ui showed up? Burkhardt and Olsen has a backdrop of something when they talk directly to the camera and the camera is focused on them.
No one touches the remote but me in the house! Not the kids, not the wife and def not the dog! So I was not fooled
Yeah, I'm guessing this is gonna effect your viewership. Probably not for the better. A lot of people got pretty pissed. But hey. Hopefully you won't hemmorage money like the other companies are. Good luck.
--Like-- if you were totally caught offguard by this commercial 😅😂
It might seem like a silly prank but It's pretty foreseeable that some families would get violent over such a thing. Very disappointed in crap like this
This girl broke up with hey boyfriend because he texted so badly to this. Cussed her out royally.
How many people checked under their ass at this moment? 🤣
How many wives and children got beat because of this ad? 🤣
tell me your comms team has no experience with DV/IPV without telling me
Deliberately never using tubi now because of this ad
You tricked me and a bunch of other people into thinking that someone sat on the remote. Well played, Tubi.
great way to make the DV rates spike even more during the Superbowl, great job, Tubi
This was not a good commercial to air. Do you know the statistics ab super bowl?? It’s one of the biggest days for domestic violence BECAUSE of the games. This video caused many to break down and get violent due to “switching the channel”. Not cool and I hope you put out a statement of apology AND shedding light on domestic violence awareness
Anyone else click cause they thought that was Dexter in the thumbnail
this has got to be the dumbest idea ever so many people got beat probably
Yeah, that got me. I stood up looking for the remote.... still couldn't tell you what the commercial was for. I do remember the chicken wings, though. Didn't want to spill them. Always remember the chicken wings
Am I the only one who didn’t freak out? My smart tv apps look nothing like this so I was like “hmm lets see where this is going”
Nah this is genius
This is gross and so many people were affected of DV. Honestly fuck this ad
Affective, attention grabbing, and everyone has a story about when this ad came on! Congrats to everyone involved over at Tubi. Jobs well done.
Add gokaiger and shinkenger
bro is this it😂 jesus
Somewhere a neighbor threw his wife out the door because of this commercial - he had had it over her interrupting the game and standing in front of the TV on purpose and thought she was doing another of her fits so he threw her out.  A kid and a dog got thrown elsewhere.
This commercial will live on in advertising classes for the rest of time
I was next to the remote and almost got a black eye so thank you tubi 🙄
Im sure this ad started fist fights, ended relationships, and trust issues lol! The power of marketing advertising!
Bunch of morons don't realize context clues, i.e. they had different jackets on. Y'all drunk!
Here because of the Reddit “off my chest” story about a man punching a wall and screaming at his girlfriend over this.
so is this the commercial that got people upset? I was at work so I saw the rabbit commercial. This is funny.
My dad literally said why the fuck are you guys changing the channel
It's obvious this was a commercial. God, people are dumb
That's freaking hilarious!
I hated this commercial. Nearly had something thrown at me while I was at work dealing with college students who were getting mad thinking we turned the game off. Thanks for making my Sunday harder than it should’ve been
The amount of domestic violence this caused should be an automatic check in to a psych ward for every man that went loko when this ad aired. We will come pick you up tomorrow
I think the ad is hilarious, but I also think everybody overreacted to it.
This was so funny i was literally yelling at my boyfriend thinking he was changing the tv
nice
I was watching this at a watch party and I thought the person controlling the tv was pulling a prank wth What was the purpose of this ad 🤣✋
Yoo everyone was looking around to see who was fuckin with the remote
I’ve heard how many fights this caused. Literally awesome commercial, but also very dangerous
Bartenders got attacked because of this
Tubi highlighting DV and high testosterone toxic males. 🙌
I actually turned the game off and restarted it, trying to 'fix' the remote
So unrealistic, everyone knows it takes around 30 mins to pick a movie to watch lol
My family and I definitely panicked
I'm so glad this ad didn't come out while I was living with my father...I can't imagine the poor kids in abusive homes who got beat over this ad that we won't hear about coz no one's gonna go to Twitter and go "haha I beat my kid over this on accident!" But I'm positive it happened...  "We made people think someone sat on the remote!" Yeah so you convinced violent men to lash out at their family members? I mean one girl got abused by her boyfriend because of this commercial that we know of...imagine what happened to the kids...  This was dangerous and stupid. Who thought it was genius to piss off men in front of their "loved ones"?
Tubi can go to hell for this. 😂😂😂😂
Genius advertisement. I'll bet whoever at Tubi came up with this is getting a fat bonus.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a good movie tho.
I'm here because of the reddit post
Tubi really out here ending relationships and shit
Genius
Andy Kauffman would be proud
Tubi sales 📈
People got beat over this commercial. Bartenders got drinks thrown at them over this. It isn't as clever as you thought.
funny till you see all the stuff about wives and hospitality staff getting beaten and yelled at over this
Were these announcers in the actual show too?
where is the ad
Welp, we are all now aware of Tubi’s existence. 😂
This was funny but the fact that ppl got so mad some domestic violence broke out is crazy
This ad saved a woman from an abusive relationship. Her boyfriend, who she had been living with for 2 months, punched a hole in the wall because he thought she did it. She left him.
Tubi....whoever thought of this idea....should recieve 1 million dollars.
You know DV cases go up on superbowl like they do for world cup in England why the fuck would you do something so dumb! Do you know how many possible lifes you put at risk!
Nice
I didn't watch the super bowl but I heard this ad was the best thing to come out of it.  I love tubi.  It has some of the best movies. Great ad!
Yo fuck tubi, I got hit because the remote was closest to me at the time
Genuis!
This ad was for making sure you were paying attention. My friends and I were blaming each other, to blaming their dog to finally turning on the light and searching for the remote, by the time the light came on and I pointed where the remote was the commercial was over. We busted out laughing after that.
Yo I just found out this was a commercial I legit thought somebody was tryna watch mr and ms smith
I was watching alone on YouTube tv so I think I was the only one who didn’t get pranked lol.
W Troll
I blamed my baby lol
Bruh my fam was blaming eachother including me
Best troll ever😭
Tubi’s marketing team or company was genius!!!!!!! Genius!!!!!!
This ad was dangerous for people in abusive households
bartenders literally got punched for this
I love how it mocked most commercials for super bowl by being the anti Super Bowl commercial.  Great service as well with lots of MST3K and Rifftrax.
I missed it.
A woman at a bar was getting yelled at bc of this
I was watching the game solo and thought my TV had been hacked …😅😅😅😅
I have tubi and would've been waiting for the movie to begin or telling my daughter play a different movie 😆😆
I knew this couldn't be mine because there's no way my TV would've loaded Tubi that quickly.
My entire family was yelling at each other and accusing each other of sitting on the remote lmao
Tubi made their formal media presence announcement with that 🔥 breathing 'mercial ~  A+ Tubi !!
let's not do ads like this anymore pls. The amount of ppl that experienced domestic violence and bartenders that were assaulted is crazy.... Ppl really turn insane in sport events
I work in a hotel & casino in Las Vegas you can hear everyone yelling in the sports book lol
anyone here from that one reddit post abt the woman leaving her bf because he punched a hole in the wall from this comercial
My dad and I were so confused lol
Have T-Mobile and we lost wifi three days before and got it back two day before so didn't get what it
Almost got into a bar fight over this ad 👍
This ad is legendary why bc it was during th superbowl
I was watching alone, so I started questioning myself!!😂😂
did y’all know bartenders and other bar staff literallt got assaulted over this ad 😭
Bruuuuhhh that's hilarious
INGENIOUS 👏🏼
My poor little 8 year old son. I yelled at him that he was sitting on the remote. And he said “ mommy I’m not sitting on the remote”. Then we all figured out it was just Tubi commercial! Genius ad! 😂
I didn’t get to watch the game, I was on the road, but I heard the aftermath from Reddit. This caused a lot of fights and break ups.
In 8 seconds Tubi started civil wars in every American household
Here from the reddit post that made a guy punch a hole in the wall because he thought it was his girlfriend switching the channels.
This was crazy.  I got up and started yelling up stairs to see if anyone was using the spare remote to change the channel.  Good one @Tubi
You almost ruined a family. Cops almost got called.  Cousin Steve told his child that he was adopted because he thought he sat on the remote. My father told my brother (who was hosting the Super Bowl party) that he wasn't good enough because of his remote and shouldn't have got his high school girlfriend pregnant 5 years ago. I was enjoying my cold blue mountains beverage when I got the remote thrown at me by a 6 year old eagles fan which then I got my 5 year old daughter to choke. Got yelled at because" who teaches a 5 year old how to put another kid in a triangle?!"  I do. Thanks for ruining our Sunday... l
Not everyone had a laugh.  Some households with abusive temperamental men had to deal with a hole in the wall or a full on man- child melt down
Brilliant!!
Perhaps the most genius ad
Anyone else here from the Reddit story of her breaking up with her bf because he had an outburst over this ad?
the amount of dislikes this probably has😂😂
This ad got me good when watching the game live.
Who's the dumb ass who thought this was a good idea? Tubi way to fuck up.
My Dad is in the hospital and I was watching it with him.  His nurse was in the room changing his bandages and I was like 'Oh my God!  *Looking at my Dad to accuse him of sitting on the remote or something* What happened?? Dad, did you accidentally change the channel??  I think whoever is in the next room must of changed the channel somehow!! What's going on??' LOL!!
I was pissed atm. I thought my Roku was being hacked. Well played, assholes.
This ad probably cost 10 million dollars! Money well spent!
Hmmmm missed that one.
Best add I ever saw
Whole family though our firestick got hacked
Tubi helped identify the red flags 🚩 (mostly angry men) with one simple ad
Y’all trolling for that
Who ever thought of this deserves a raise.
This is wild.
A ton of relationships were ended over this commercial
I need this commercial in my everyday life. Big round of applause to you Tubi. 👏🏿 actually made me download it.
A girls head got knocked between the washer and the dryer because of this ad. 😬
You know you prob got someone gf/wife beat that day.
I love Tubi 💙💪🏽
well played tubi… well played
https://youtu.be/l2FPMbSLFRo
People broke up over this ad
We left the bar we were watching the game at because we thought it was real
I fell for this. I thought someone had dha remote for a sec n was messing around
Listen I’m like wtf I just put my controller on the floor how 😂
hahaha mdfssss i was so mad at myself
Why all steaming serives logo? 😒
Whoever came up with this in Tubi should get promotion, period, imagine dozens of company spend total hundreds of millions dollars for Superbowl ad, in the end one stood out everybody talk about, Tubi basically kill all the other ads
We live in a time where we all have the same TV features, and everyone was yelling at someone when this went down 😂
I was ready to fight.
I saw a tweet about a guy calling his mother in law a B for messing with the remote 😂
R.I.P to all the relationships this commercial ended
Almost got ppl killed 😂😂😂😂
Tubi started a family civil war 💀
They pulled a She-Hulk ☠️
The whole bar was drunk was going nuts thinking someone was messing with us 🤣🤣🤣
*My dad and brother were ranting at me because I had the remote but it next to me and thought I changed it, even though we don’t have tubi. And then he saw that it was a commercial and felt stupid.*
Had me up here cussin ppl out like "AY! Which one of ya'll mfs got the remote" everybody lookin like around like  🤷🏾‍♂️.. then i realized it was a commercial 😂😂
Does Tubi broadcast the NBA?
They pulled a she-hulk. Not entirely original.
This ad nearly caused a violent riot
.
This caused so many arguments 😂
Why would making drunk people angry be a good idea?
Someone in the company needs a huge a** raise 😂
This was a nice ad, but does anyone remember the ad in the beginning of the Super Bowl with Seahawks vs patriots? I remember the screen turning black but it being part of the ad haha
God Damnit! Jimmy stop fiddling with the remote…. Oh wait it’s a tubi commercial.
Fr😂😂😂
Lol, one of the funniest, but cleverest ads ever lol.
Honestly, this is why I’m keeping Tubi. One of the funniest and most original commercials in years.
The BEST commercial prank ever ❤😂
I am now a subscriber of TUBI
Literally just saw a tiktok of a waitress who got drinks thrown at her because of this ad. The people thought she changed the station
I was like “But I’m watching this on an Apple TV… OHHHHH!”
You guys got me good! 😂😂😂😂😂
Hate the ad, love the creativity.
I was like WTF, i didn't hit Tubi?
https://youtu.be/a0-6d0ZcrF4
Who would've thought 15 seconds would cause chaos.  Goes to show how hooked we all are on the Superbowl and how easy it is to grab our attention and react to it.  Great ad!  👏👏👏
There were people who were actually assaulted over this ad and it’s just a little prank? It’s a great ad I just cant believe what some people will do over this 😭
This could EASILY have led to violence. Y'all need to find some chill.

The thing that makes me mad about this commercial, is the fact that Tubi has the nerve to even think about streaming Jack and Jill. Who would watch that garbage?
Best ad ever 😭
When this came on my friend yelled at me “WHAT ARE YOU DOING” and I scrambled for the remote. I hate it.
I thought I was sitting on the remote when this came on T-T
Jesus Christ loves you ❤
If somebody fell for that you might have problems...
My dad was so enraged by this ad that he tried to strangle me to death. My mother lunged at him with a kitchen knife and my brother whacked her repeatedly with a baseball bat, while my younger sister cried and called the police. The police showed up and shot the dog, who  bit one of the policemen's balls off. I punched one of the cops in the face. My court date is next Thursday. The point is, prank ads are not a joke.
Best advertisement of all time.
BRO EVERYBODY WAS LIKE WHO TOUCHED THE REMOTE !?!?!?!?!?!!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.   I'd like to share if you're interested, just reply and I can send you the link.  May Jesus Bless you!
The greatest commercial ever
classic
I heard a story where this ad made someone leave their boyfriend for reacting psychotically to it. •-• but amazing commercial it was hilarious!
So many bartenders got assaulted by irate customers because they got mad thinking the bartender changed it
my parents thought I was using an app on my phone from downstairs.
It worked. It made me want to rewatch  Mr. And Mrs. Smith 😂
Saw a girl broke up with her bf on reddit today because of this ad
THE 100 Cast Ages And Real Names https://youtu.be/eaAD4ui3Tp0
ACCORDING  TO  PFIZER  HAPPY  MYOCARDITIS  EVERYONE ! ! !
ACCORDING  TO  PFIZER  HAPPY  MYOCARDITIS  EVERYONE ! ! !
ACCORDING  TO  PFIZER  HAPPY  MYOCARDITIS  EVERYONE ! ! !
I’ve already heard of guys screaming at their partners and punching holes in the wall. I hope this ended lots of dangerous relationships by showing a few true colours.
Bro why am i just now realizing this was an ad?
The Ad that almost broke apart households
Breaking Bad chip commercial was the best
Am I the only one who believed it?
https://youtu.be/32RAq6JzY-w
Everyone was jebaited
i dont even have tubi and i got played. smh
Hahaha people got assaulted over this ad
Someone was trying to switch the tv from the Spanish broadcast to the English and right when she did that, this ad came on
The Look On The Guy's Faces. They Were Trying Not To Laugh.
This ad was likely responsible for a few domestic disturbance calls the other night.
Who ever came up with that idea is a POS but they definitely deserve a huge raise.. Now let me explain why they're an asshole, my friend and his wife getting a divorce bcz of that ad.. My friend was a little tipsy and when the ad started he started yelling and cussing at his wife and punched a hole in the wall.. And now his wife thinks he have anger issues which she believes it's a huge red flag so yeah she asked for divorce and now they're separated and starting with the divorce process.. 😅😜Lol so tubi you're an asshole
I had litterally just sat down with my plate of nachos when this ad played. I had people yelling at me about sitting on the remote. Lol they got us all..
I really wish I could have seen this real time
I wonder how many servers lost their tips because of this ad
Haha I would’ve lost my shit
I work at a bar. People were screaming at the bartender like he was the biggest asshole
Tubi is now goated after this what a troll
I was like what’s going on here 🤣😂
Best troll job ever
someone on reddit dumped her boyfriend over his reaction to this 💀
DV cases📈📈
This is amazing. The fact that it cut the broadcast off, whoever thought of this, excellent work. Let the employee(s) know
Not people breaking up over this
i can’t believe someone actually broke up over this ad 💀
Mannn this had me mad at everyone sitting on the couch even though the remote was on the table 😂
https://youtu.be/tEuTRWTkpps
The panic that this ad has caused proves that everyone pretty much has the same TV.
Was funny shit  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man I seriously thought I was sitting on the remote💀
I’m unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic. I do believe I’m being monitored or hacked. This would’ve made me pack my bags and travel to the moon 😂 I’m glad I found out about this commercial from a meme
I did exit. And went back in.
It got everyone’s attention but everyone is still big mad that they won’t ever use Tubi.
I was blaming my wife and in a panic grabbed tge remote and accidentally hit the home button and had to navigate my way back to the ACTUAL game. I was so embarrassed! Lol
break ups happened due to this 😂😂😂
Tubi, bringing out the worst in people.
This is the 21st century version of that old prank where kids would take a bar of soap and draw fake cracks on church windows 😛
Lol the only problem i see is grown ass men not able to control their emotions over a dam football game, because this was a great ad and got everyone talkin about it
I blamed my dog for stepping on the remote lol. Sorry Cheerio! 🐶
I had a roku which has a completely different interface so in theory this should not have fooled me but it still did so good job guys
Genius, loved it.  You are awesome 😎.
https://youtu.be/6xOLYIxgCZ0
"Attenion is the most expensive currency on the planet" what a great way to make your brand relevant in everyone's mind for years to come very different from the coinbase ad but the results will definitely be positive
this was genius i genuinely thought my tv got hacked
I can only imagine how many people simultaneously screamed out:  *"WHAT DAFUQ!?"* *WHO HAS THE REMOTE!?*
The greatest troll commercial ever, and perhaps top of the list of Super Bowl ads period.
Got em good sportsman's ship 🤑🍿💯👀
I almost through my one year old son on the couch cuz I thought he was on my remote lol tubi got me
You made my husband think the house had ghosts!
Everyone got the same tv’s
Excellent marketing promote whoever came up with this.
At hooters we had some street preachers outside, and legitimately thought they manged to sneak inside start changing the channels.
Best Super Bowl ad I can remember in a while. Kid in Darth Vader costume uses The Force to start his Volkswagen.
Punked the nation 😂
Y’all are evil
This legit got us i was so confused haha
Is there any easier way to start a family feud?. Tubi nailed it.
Few relationships destroyed by this commercial😂😂
I thought the Chinese spy balloon hacked my television
It’s a great ad! Too bad waiters ended up actually getting assaulted because of it though 😬
Theres multiple bartenders talking about how this caused drunks to attack them
I didn’t watch the game but that’s just evil
Love how we all start blaming each other as soon as THIS ad plays.
I fell this lol
Seconds before this came on, I literally said "this year's commercials kinda suck". Then, I watched my wife frantically search for the remote and this quote popped into my head. "Just when I thought you couldn't get any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!" (Dumb & Dumber)
I got pranked soooo bad on this one lamo 💀
Dumbass biden and every liberal nazi blamed trump for sitting on the remote when he wasn’t even in he same state as them
Oh that's EVIL!   I like it!
Tubi over here getting kids yelled at nationwide
THIS is the ad that people were assaulting bartenders over? I think it’s a cute and funny ad; sports fans can be awful.
Was at the bar and literally everyone started screaming lmao
This ad stood out during the Super Bowl for all the right reasons. It wasn't overblown with celebrity, and it was memorable.

Somehow this is genius. But when she hulk did it, it was woke and stupid lol. I understand
I wish someone had told me sooner that saying I believe in Jesus while living in habitual sin still leads to eternal damnation. I wish someone had cared to tell me about the narrow road that leads to life and the wide path that leads to destruction. I wish someone had told me repentance is joyful, not judgmental. I wish someone had told me... turns out Someone did. Jesus did. His Word says all this and much more. Get in The word .THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST FOR paying the price for the forgiveness of all sins through your death.  . "The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, divisions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God." Galatians 5:19-21 *  ""Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."Matthew 7:13-14 *  "I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent."Luke 15:7  Repent, be baptized for forgiveness of sins, & receive Holy Spirit Acts2:36-41, Acts 19:1-7.  HE WHO BELIEVETH & IS BAPTIZED SHALL BE SAVED Mark 16:16-17. Lord Jesus, I invite You and ask You to come into my heart. I confess my sins and ask You to forgive me. I accept You as my Savior and Lord. I want to turn away from my sins and pray that Your Holy Spirit will help me follow  Your way. I believe that You have come and are living in me right now. Thank You, Lord. In Jesus, I pray. Amen
My brother and nephew were yelling like who took the remote
I knew it was an ad right away
No way ppl are saying that they didn’t notice it was a commercial.
When I was watching the Super Bowl and I saw that happened I thought I said in the remote
Easily the best ad of the year, if not the last decade. Totally tripped me out 😂. The team that developed this idea deserves their own Super Bowl trophy!
Im surprised on how many people it fooled
Pay flamingo for his videos man
I wonder, how much they pay for only 10 secs of ad 😂
I had a 20 minute delay on the Super Bowl, and when this happened my family was so confused and mad and we had to turn it off and back on, and when we did the delay was gone and it said the Chiefs won the Super Bowl 💀 we didn’t even get to watch the ending
Almost had a heart attack looking for my remote 😭
Tubi somebody almost lost they life tonight lmao because of this commercial 😂😂
Here to say I witnessed Tubi history live 😂
I personally knew it was an ad right away because of how they looked. But my neighbors, who were hosting, had that EXACT same interface so they were actually freaking out. Best ad by far
Tubi had me outside walking around my house with a tomahawk. Look, I thought someone was playing a prank on me and snooping around outside. 🤣
Everyone who has a smartcast tv was hollering 😂😂
The way we all instantly broke out screaming at eachother. Tubi is a SIIIIICKNEEESSSS
Everyone was yelling at each other. Genius
y’all had me scrambling to my remote thinking my tv was hacked 😂
absolutely genius marketing
This is one of the best ads I've EVER seen, period. It completely did what it was supposed to, grab the attention of people in an unexpected way. Great job guys!
My whole family broke out blaming each other for sitting on the remote. My dad said my brother was but really it was the ad. My dad was also very clearly holding the remote. We all said that we hated Tubi after seeing this ad. I’m still dying of laughter inside.
Tubi perfectly described Football fans, moronic and aggressive
The BIGGEST fourth wall break ever!
My entire youth group had a Super Bowl party and oh my goodness that ad got us all a Deere so confused that was the best ad
My whole family broke out blaming each other for sitting on the remote. My dad said my brother was but really it was the ad. My dad was also very clearly holding the remote. We all said that we hated Tubi after seeing this ad. I’m still dying of laughter inside.
It broke the fourth wall tubi why
Lol roku actually be doing this 🤣
Didn’t watch the super bowl, don’t give a shit what happened during the Super Bowl. But seeing all the talk about this commercial here i am. Seen this commercial but still couldn’t tell you who won’t the game, great job who evers idea this way.
What an ad
Blog कैसे बनाये और पैसे कैसे कमाए  https://shivamvlg.blogspot.com/2023/02/blog.html
what is a tubi
I killed my homeboy because of this ad. Mistook him for changing the game
I love tubi so much. But I've been saying for years that their advertising was a bit lackluster. But holy shit this is good
Mr. n Mrs. Smith is my fav movie I was kinda hype
I gotta use a laptop now because I got my phone taken cause of this
Dang you got me good on this one 😂
This was brilliant! 👏👏👏
I was bartending in a packed sports bar…. This fucking commercial caused absolute chaos.
Y'all shoulda seen the side eye my mom gave me
Who ever plotted that, deserves an early 401k
My mother’s living room TV isn’t a smart tv and I was freaking out how she had TUBI and other apps on there! 😂
super bowl rigged?? https://youtu.be/q4tZ5M2etUQ
I dead ass thought someone was outside my house with an Xfinity remote doing some kind of TikTok 😂
Good thing I don't have a smart TV
I want to know the name of the person that pitched commercial idea because they are an absolute genuis
I didn't watch the game, but I do watch Tubi and I can see how this would get somebody cussed all the way out. 😤🤣
I feel bad for all the bar tenders that had the people screaming at them thinking they changed the channel 💀
https://youtu.be/dX4Ycy3POm4
Ong😂😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PLawK-Jjqo
They managed not to make one comment about the actual game, & still fooled a lot of people. Y'all can top this by buying DC Stargirl, since she commented on it, too.
This won….
https://youtu.be/dX4Ycy3POm4
A marriage was nearly dissolved after this commercial!😂
It was the best prank on every SB host
Made me feel like the house was haunted... Almost left a decent super bowl party 🤦🏾‍♂️
Best ad ever
My boyfriend and I were at a restaurant and thought they were subtly trying to kick us out lol
i don’t even have tubi and this freaked me out for a minute😂😂
literally the greatest ad of all time
These guys really made history
This was the most genius ad ever. Tricked the whole world, and got everyone’s attention.
Brilliant but dangerous. There should have been a message at the end: "It's not your remote, it's Tubi".
We was about to break the tv
Greatest troll of 2023 lol
just want to let ya know that God loves you all, we have to turn from sin and repent before it’s too late, John 14:6 says “I’m the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me”🙏🏽🤍
My first time ever commenting on an ad that I saw on TV. Wow, this was hilarious and perfect
OK BUT WHY DID THIS GET ME I DONT HAVE TUBI WHAT 😭
Everyone watching with me was screaming looking for the remote but the best part is that we don’t even have tubi 😂😂😂
Family Start Looking At One Another…Like Who Touch The Remote 😂
This proves the game was rigged, how did the announcers in the commercial know how the game was going if they film the commercial before the game took place??
Man that commercial really got me! Lol 😅😂
Every started yelling LOL.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
I’m glad I’m not the only one who was looked at as crazy
I feel like Tubi got kids beat during the game.
Bro me and my family at the SB 2023 party absolutely fell for that commercial I thought someone accidentally sat on the remote lol best tubi commercial ever 😂
I was mad at my dad because when this commercial came on he had the remote and I thought he was turning the Super Bowl off, this commercial was a genius idea 😂🤣
Whoever thought of this ad is an evil genius who enjoys chaos.
Tubi about to get sued for all the emotional damage it cost
Me and my brother didn't fall for it but our dad did wondering why my brother changed it lol
Got me so good
My dad yelled at me thinking I was switching the channels last night xD!
Watching that live for my dad to yell out asking who was sitting on the remote. 🤣 brilliant idea, Tubi.
I thought someone broke in the house and started switching apps behind me😂
She-Hulk did it first
WAIT DIS WAS FAKE??
Mean
https://youtube.com/shorts/HjAjDfbe7Ik?feature=share
People were punched in the face and sent to the hospital because of this ad. Thanks tubi
this is so good i love you tubi
This ad makes even more sense after the anti-cliamatic ending to the super bowl.
There was a huge superbowl party at my college. When this happened everyone was screaming WHO DID THAT!  It was funny
I was watching it on my laptop and this caught me off guard. 😂😂
I did the same thing 😂😂😂
I spilt my chips because of this ad  It had me tripping af
They just tricked out at least 10 million people
Yelled at my brother for changing it
dancing come see me
Shout out to Tubi
All my friends stopped and looked at me like I had switched to Roku. 🤣🤣🤣
This just fools people watching the game on their multi-app TV/console. Still, it's a lot of fun. I wonder how other people react to seeing this.
That goes to show you the power of a wire order power of pressing a single button 😂✅
If you made people look for the remote, you made them remember Tubi
Great. I had to hear my mom scream my ear off asking who turned the TV.  😂
Jokes on u Tubi I was watching on a laptop    But I did think the stream I was watching had froze and ended up watching the ad so I guess it's really on me
🚀🛸🛰⌛🕒🌞🌌❤
Satan Bowl
Yooo everybody did freak out. Lmao
Nobody trolls my superbowl never going to use u now
bro this made my whole family so confused it was so funny 💀💀
You fool. Im on cable
Trolled the world.    Slow Clap
I feel like yall cut the ad short. I swear it lasted longer than 15 sec…
My life flashed before my eyes as I stared in disbelief as I saw the remote by my side and all eyes on me came alive...
The best AD of all Superbowl ADS this year. The most memorable of all times for me. Had me picking up the remote and screaming at the TV. 🤣 Give the creative genius a $500, 000 extra bonus for coming up with this one.
Everyone’s praising this ad but I thought it was stupid and annoying as possible. Why tf did the NFL let them advertise like this??
I didn’t watch the Super Bowl. Definitely missed out on experiencing this historic USA moment... Ten years from now, when my kids ask, “What were you doing when the Tubi advertisement played?” I would tell them, “Kids, Daddy didn’t watch the game at all. Instead, I was testing out a new lasagna recipe!” 😅
i was so confused when this happen and i don’t even use tubi😂
holy shit i thought i was the only one that this happened to i freaked the fuck out thinking there was some ghost in my house that took the control over or something cause i was home alone so shit spooked me a bit but then i realized it was an ad and just sat there in disbelief lol
My family literally almost fought me and my dog because they thought we were sitting on the remote 😡
Tubi, You Sly Dog You
I would go crazy if tube actually commented on this comment
I had the remote in my hand when this commercial happened my dad was about to beta my ass lmao
I thought my cat was sitting on the remote so I tried to lift her up. She scratched me 😢 and then tried to cuddle afterwards.
Some serial experiments lain type shyt
Just genius. Now everyone is talking about tubi.
Bro we really thought it was real , I was yelling at everyone like where is the remoteeeee ! 🤣🤣
My mom and dad were watching it in the living room while I was in my room watching it, only their TV did that
very funny; yall got usj.
Everyone at my work said they immediately went looking for the remote as did I lol
Why did I actually fall for it though 😂😂😂😂
I was this close 👌 to almost karate chopping my mother in law's nose and her dog's two hind legs thinking they switched off the game. Well played Tubi, very well played...SAVAGES!!! 🙌
Bravo to you guys 😂 i fell for it cause my samsung tv has that same interface and apps installed i thought a neighbor was trolling me
If only y'all was in our living room when this aired.. 🤣🤣
Man me and my nana were watching the Super Bowl and we were like:WHAT THE TV DOIN!?
This caused a civil war in my house 💀
Bro this is the same streaming service that stole Albert’s videos (Flamingo) ☠️
Never gonna buy this product. Way to aggressive and abrupt marketing.
I can’t be the only one who knew instantaneously that it was fake? The transition was so horrible bruh. And Greg Olsen and Kevin Burkhardt would’ve never said a random statement like that for being professional broadcasters.
I was blaming my dad saying wtf why you did that now it was genius marketing
Nice to see Tubi trending.
mate when that happened, i thought my brother changed it.. me and grandpa were mad at him but it was an add.
I watched the game...obviously missed the ad...I don't remember seeing it at all...
This freaked tf outta me lmao
Y’all almost got my kids whooped 😂😂😂😂
They didn't fool me. I swear!
Watched my wife melt down in real time.. epic commercial
The commercial that ruined family relationships.
When I first saw this ad I was like “Is the TV possessed?”
*congratulations on making me pissed off*
Anyone who fell for it should at least have to watch one movie on Tubi.
I thought my dad was sitting on the remote when that happened.
this actually freaked me out
FAX!
Y’all believed this? LOL
Pranked many yesterday Forsure
I didn’t even have Tubi and this got me
i was like. what you doin. my dad said its not me. im like wat🤣
We were all blaming my friends 2 year old lmao
I loved this ad.  I thought my neighbor remote was controlling my TV I was so pissed.  Genius.  I know Tubi now
I thought my dad changed the channel 💀
This scared me
Me watching the ad without an smart tv: 😐
This really fooled my Mom, my sister, and I. We genuinely thought someone was sitting on the remote, when it was really on laying next to the lamp. 😆
this ad literally made me commit fucking war crimes. thanks tubi /j
Lmao they deff got me i was like wtf whats going and restarted my firestick epic
This was Owen Hart levels of pranking! 😂
That was Rick Roll level GENIUS. People got #TubiRolled for sure. 😂👌🏽
I was screaming at my kids cause i thought they sat on the remote 😭😭
My entire family was looking at my granddad. 😂
The whole bar was screaming boo at the workers. I was too drunk to even notice till after the super bowl lol
Literally the worst ad of all time. I will never ever ever ever ever ever buy anything from yall.
This was like when Kratos died while fighting Thor in GOW Ragnarok
Tubi just gained a lot of angry fans.
Brad:Let’s Go Tubi Nope Nope Nope Aaaah Tubi App Free Movies And Ads
you guys did the most genius way to do an ad, it's now my favorite ad. 100/10
It got me.. i even yelled at my kid thinking he was on the remote 😐 nice job Tubi
Was at a party of about a half-dozen when this came on.  Looked at the host who does have the propensity to switch to the Golf Channel for commercials during regular games to say, what ya doing there?  The game's afoot!  I think we were all fooled.  We got a good laugh.
All the kids and spouses having to suffer the emotional damage imparted by Dad screaming at them "What the F are you doing?" I yelled minus the profanity.  And I don't even like football - this is the one game I watch every year though, regardless of who was playing.
Why is this not trending?
My dad blamed me in front of everyone. I was sitting next to him! I’m like “so quick to blame dad” glad it was a commercial 😂😂😂
The idea behind this is insane. Best advertisement of 2023.
Got em!
Worst ad ever, if it can be called an ad. We groaned at the annoyance.
My whole family freaked out, this was perfect 😂😂
Masses are really dumb if they fell for that..  Witch means people don't recognize there own TV settings witch means idk what it means but I'm sure the information will be valuable for whoever did this pysop
Drop the name of the creative team. What a stunt. Congrats folks
I need to find reaction to people watching Tubi Super Bowl commercial.
They copied this from the last She Hulk episode
We had the game delayed by a few minutes.  When it happened I tried to find the live broadcast and ended up at the post game coverage.  In hindsight I should have paused it just to make sure I was on the right channel.  We watched the last few minutes on YouTube.
Whole bar was like yoooooo! 😂
Thanks Tubi, i yelled at my wife for no reason.
Didn't trick me. I was alone in my room with the remote on the table, so I knew there was no way it was anything but a commercial
y’allcaused fights fr
Great ad…but I will 100% not get tubi after the chaos that caused.
you got us, we all thought my sister sat on the remote
Was high asf when I saw this. I thought a ghost was doing it.
I enjoyed it and thought it was pretty clever, but I could tell right away it was still a broadcast signal since the graphics and background showed compression artifacts that are not present in an actual smart TV menu.
Had the world snappin when this aired
Tubi I want you to know that you almost caused a family fight and I absolutely love you for that. It was fantastic!!
I had to skip some ads to watch this ad.
I was yelling at my friend. Definitely the best ad
Marketing manager deserves a raise 😂🎉
YAY TUBI!
I hope you're proud of yourselves. You started World War 3.
I thought the neighbor downstairs was fucking with me
I got yelled at and I wasn't even downstairs. Tf 🤣😂😂
I thought someone hacked the whole fox sports station and was gonna play something else
I was super sick and zoned out during the game but somehow realized right away it was just a commercial. So while my family was all trying to figure out who messed the tv up I was being cranky telling them all to just calm down.
Great ad tubi got me good
Lmao
Tubi is better than watching the Stupor Bowl anyway.
I fooled my friends when this came on. Laughed my ass off!!
Sadly I couldn’t watch the game, but they snapped😂
Illuminati 🥴
lol
Hilarious.
So good. The entire bar broke out thinking someone was messaging with the TV. hahahahha
Tubi better stay free. I love my free Tubi commercials and all
I knew it was a joke when they played mr & mrs smith. Nobody likes that movie
Legit thought Tubi was hijacked and the hackers wanted to ruin the game for everyone
Top 10 unexpected anime betrayals:
BEST COMMERCIAL, EVER!!! Hella THREW people off!! LOVE IT! 😂😂😂😂
hello Michael you watch the super bowl last night
This commercial almost caused World War III
I wish i was watching the game just for this moment lol
Best superbowl ad EVER!! too bad I live with a conspiracy nut. who thought the TV was being hacked. even tho I kinda knew right away it was part of the ad. our tv doesn't have that UI sound.
Someone give the creative director / team who pitched this idea a massive raise. If you don’t, another company will prolly poach them quick because this was genius
This ad was perfect. People were about to start throwing hands over this commercial. Well done
Kojima would be proud
Stupid ad. Solely on account of this ad I guarantee i will NEVER use Tubi.
You destroyed my family.
Well now we know who owns tubi.
Tubi🐐😂😂😂❤️
😂😂
🎉 Congratulations @Tubi for winning the CLIO Award for your“Rabbit Hole” commercial 🏆
Fuck this commercial. 🤣  It got me and my brother in law so good. We both thought each other changed the channel and looked at the remote sitting on the sofa arm. But still thought we did it with our phones.
I thought that I was sitting on the remote.
Best ever. I jumped up trying to find the remote and figure out what happened😩😂
This started a particularly violent altercation at my house involving my dad and uncle. By the time we separated them to say it was a commercial it had already ended so they didn’t believe us and are still not talking to each other. Hopefully I can prove it to them with this and smooth things over.
This has to be one of the best and biggest pranks ever done. Fooled everyone
Surprised Jimmy Kimmel wasn't booked for this stunt. This is his lane. 😅
Please stand by super bowl ad lol
The fact that my remote was jammed between the couch cushion i was sitting on made me think i did it accidentally 😂😂
My family went crazy over it! My dad grabbed that remote so fast and tried to change it but he actually changed the game!
Had me looking under the couch looking for my remote like what the hell going on
Definitely got me! I was staring at my remote on the table and could not figure out how it was doing that! 😭🤣
You guys did good on this one 👏
Y’all wrong for this 😂😂😂😂 I was legit confused and a little terrified with the remote sitting beside me and no one else being home. 😂😂😂😂 definitely got me!!!!
I been using tubi since 2020, Much Love ! ❤️
Wow, this got us good. There was a lot of "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! PUT BACK ON THE GAME!"
You got us
People might not have liked this ad, but "TUBI" was prominently named in it and it is memorable. I knew something was not on the up and up as I had full control of my remotes. But I can see more crowded places people freak out and play against each other.
Tubi hacked my TV
boycott tubi
Absolutely brilliant!!!!!!  Yes we all got mad, especially if you use a streaming service. We have tubi as part of our package. Honestly I never watch any programs on Tubi. But this caught my attention and now I’m interested in at least seeing what shows they offer… Brilliant marketing… Sorry for those that got mad, but you have to admit. It was brilliant. Way to go Tubi!!!! 😊
Okay. We don't watch the Super Bowl anymore, but always look for the (good) commercials.  This was next level! Awesome job! I can see all those folks scrambling for their remotes!
I was watching a pirated stream of the game thought I was fucked
Best superbowl commercial cause we were ready to tussle lolll
Thanks  My wife yelled at me thinking I laid on the remote.
W prank
I was at Bdubbs and I thought they were trying to kick us out by turning the game off🤣
It was funny until I was like hey Comcast is never that fast even when they promise high speeds lol
To be fair, Mr and Mrs Smith is a pretty decent movie. Like Spy X Family without the little girl.
Thanks for getting me yelled at over this, It came on while I was sitting on the couch and was accused of changing it lmao
I have Roku only so that wouldn't fool me
I was at a friend's house so I didn't know if his TV had this. Had me yelling at mfs
BY FAR THE BEST COMMERCIAL FOR THE SUPER BOWL! This Started FIGHTS EVERYWHERE LMAO
I was at a bar and when this aired everyone in the bar was pissed!!
Genius
Me watching on a laptop computer, "what are they trying to do with this Ad?"
The amount of trust issues my family had when this ad came on, lol. Good one, Tubi.
I love you guys for this
Tubi won the superbowl commercial game!
I yelled at my 88yr old grandma 😭
I didn’t know what Tubi was until last night. Now I’ll be looking into it lol
We were watching it live, with a TV antenna, and my wife still thought I was doing something. Just bad luck that I picked up my phone a few seconds before the commercial!
Tubi is one of my favorite streaming channels and its FREE! Go figure. Very underrated IMO.
This ad sucks! I hate Tubi because it made my dad and my little brother argue over the remote!!! DAMN YOU TUBI AND YOUR EFFIN AD!!
That was a good one Tubi. We freaked out. We were looking and shouting "WHO'S CHANGING IT!?" We thought it was our step neice. 🤣🤣🤣
I walked back into the room mid way through this commercial thinking "WTF IS HAPPENING!!?" Grabbing my remote frantically, checking the HDMI port. I had no idea what the hell was going on! My nerves were already on edge with my Eagles damn it! 😂🙄😬
They could've been even more troll if they clicked a TV show as it was transitioning to commercial so you don't know the next commercial is on the Super Bowl.
damn did anyone NOT like this ad?? 😂😂
This was some She-Hulk shit 😂
Best commercial hands down
This is the greatest commercial I have ever seen. The Troll is god tier! I’m going to start watching tubi now
Sales will be going up this week I see.
I thought I was going crazy!!! Who turned it on to Tubi!!! Great job Tubi!!!
This happening at a sports bar was so chaotic
Who changed the channel?
Y'all are mad childish for this one. 😂
Genius
Tubi with the 2023 Rick Roll 😂
People in "best halftime commercial" video roundups literally commenting the tubi was the best made me look this up.
the greatest troll in american tv history
Me and my Dad FREAKED!!
And if you don't have Tubi people weren't pranked...
mf😂
I was watching on my phone and I thought it was a glitch.😂
Everyone watching on Roku was super confused.
had me for a sec 💀
Genius commercial
I didn’t fall for because my TV is super old!
Mr. & Mrs. Smith?! If I’m going on Tubi, I’m watching some crazy low-budget horror movie.
This was so funny, my friends and I thought he must’ve sat on the remote
Just made me realize how fake everything is
Fire AD 🔥 good job tubi
Thought my son changed the channel. Good one!🤣😂🤣😂
These guys really made history 😂
Congrats, you have effectively raised the blood pressure of America.
That's dope 🔥
Here to say I witnessed Tubi history live 😂
And here I thought nothing could top the DVD screensaver ad from last year’s game. Brilliant ad Tubi! I got blamed by my entire family because I actually pull similar pranks on them. Almost got my head chopped off tonight!😂
My roommate was sleeping on the other couch thought he rolled onto the remote. Considered smacking tf outta him
Marketing person is a genius
I missed this ad. I literally watched all of them but the best one :(.
y’all confused me 😭
Best commercial I ever seen
Se mamaron 😂😂
We all freaked out especially since this happened right near the end with the score being neck-and-neck. My dad shouted at the top of his lungs at my 3 year old niece cause he thought she had the remote. 😂😂😂
Had me for a second! Until I saw the remote was on my coffee table and realized this was impossible.
Friends to foes😂😂. Awesome commercial
i could tell it was an ad..
Literally the best fucking Super Bowl ad ever....
I got a black eye from this commercial and my parents are divorcing.
I run a sports bar in NYC. Everyone was freaking out when this happened, and looking straight at me  lol
Y’all a menace for that 😂😂😂 absolute genius tho 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I feel sorry for my friend that I was watching the game with. I threw a water bottle at him and yelled "what the f*** are you doing!" I swear we've never laughed so hard! Good job Tubi! 🤣
Hands down THE super bowl 2023 commercial. Fite me
This the most savage commercial ever. They faked out like 20million people
YEP i fell for it too, was Looking under the couch cushions...Lmao.....Anyways TUBI is free so it cant be a Money thing -Just viewers.---I was Like dam im on Regular TV, Not Roku...wth???...lol
💡 Next year, do a Roku version! 🤣
What in the world 😂😂😂 I didn’t even watch the game bc I had to work but what in the world 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone on the bar went crazy with the meneger when this happened!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Great marketing to be honest
They got this from SheHulk
We blamed the cat
Bro the creepiest thing was that my family was just talking about Angelina Jolie in Mr and Mrs Smith 💀
So were there different interfaces for everyones tv's?
I thought there was a damn ghost in the house
This fifteen second ad did better at breaking the fourth wall than She-Hulk.
I personally knew it was an ad right away because of how they looked. But my neighbors, who were hosting, had that EXACT same interface so they were actually freaking out. Best ad by far
I thought my TV was messing up
I had to apologize to my dog
Evil geniuses.
Dang you guys punked me good. I thought my TV got hacked somehow. I was googling it for a long time afterwards.
But how did tubi know my tv's interface??! My commercial looked just like my samsung home screen, not like what's shown in the video.  Thats scary to me
Genius marketing lowkey
genius
I know my dad is old because he told me to quit messing around with the TV
This is genius. Best tactic ever in my opinion. Had my friends and I in a screaming match
It's clearly  on a green  screen  and the angle is wrong. I could  immediately  see something  is off. Plus, you should know that a roku  or your operating  system doesn't  look like that lol
I thought my dog sat on the remote which he's notorious for doing
BRO I KNEW IT
dawg i was high as a kite watching the game and seeing the commercial freaked me out that i thought a ghost was controlling the remote bro what the fuck tubi
Now this is how you advertise
Best superbowl commercial !
This commercial almost caused some people there lives!!!
If anyone ever says the name Mr. & Mrs Smith I’m gonna cry 😭
You cause a war 😶
The way we all instantly broke out screaming at eachother. Tubi is a SIIIIICKNEEESSSS
Bro I thought someone hacked my tv and I was yelling at my girlfriend why would you do that!! LOL the whole time it was an ad
Literally scared the crap outta me was watching the super bowl with my daughter I looked at her like what you are doing and noticed she didn’t have the remote and I didn’t have the remote so I looked to the side of me and the remote was there all I could think about was big brother was taking over😂😂😂😂
I can’t name 3 people that use tubi :/
That is elite trolling
“WHO CHANGED THE CHANNEL” 🤣🤣
All I know is I was yelling at my 10 year old!!! Lmfao Tubi you are brilliant! Lmfao let’s go KC CHIEFS!
dont even got tubi and i was scrambling for my remote, i thought a mf hacked my tv.
this had me thinking a glitch in the matrix was happening
😂😂 ya wilding
My parents are now divorced because of this
Bro they ani’t slick for this 😂😂😂
I was freaking out lmao
Brilliant commercial.  Got me screaming and my bro and sis for the remote and then..... you bastards!@ It got me searching for tubi tonight
That was great because we got into an argument blaming each other for pressing buttons scrambling for the remote before it ended
Literally startled & Scared ts out of me bravo ☠️
Nah but fr, that shit caught me and the fam off guard. Watched it on YouTube tv so every time it exited out of the app I had to sign back in. You mf's 💀
Pranksters
I was with my friends watching the Super Bowl. And when this add came we all went crazy mad at him because we thought we switched the channel
I can’t be the only one that noticed that the back ground looked different and new it was a commercial
Legendary trolling
The whole house broke out
I legitimately got really scared when that happened lol😂
Got me good 😅
This was a short ad so likely wouldnt have had much of an effect on the reaction, but imagine the game was a blowout at the time this ad occurred. People would be like "what? Why would you expect the game to be a blowout?" Or if another big QB injury happened and this came on right after
play too much 😂
Yal win 😂
this freaked me out i thought my bro change the channel
Tubi had me outside walking around my house with a tomahawk. Look, I thought someone was playing a prank on me and snooping around outside. 🤣
We blamed our 2 year old hahah
This fooled my family even though we have a roku and the interface looks nothing like this
i thought someone did change the channel it funny asf😂😂😂
I thought a ghost was controlling the remote 😂
Best advertising everrrrrr
Bro
This commercial almost cost me my life!!! I called my 39 week pregnant wife upstairs like “hey are you connected to the tv with your phone?! Why did you put on mr and mrs smith!?” I heard the distress in her voice and immediately said “omg I’m sitting on the remote sorry” when I wasn’t even near the remote! This commercial dang near made my be murdered by my wife, and at the same time made me lie to her to avoid my death.   Well done but omg 😳
my kids have done this a million times before this commercial. I was like yoooo! turn the game back on then a few  seconds later I realized I had seen one of the best super bowl commercials in a while.
My parents and all their friends were literally yelling my name (I was in the bathroom without my phone) trying to get me to fix the TV. The funny thing is...earlier in the night, I mirrored a YouTube video of Janet Jackson's superbowl mishap onto the big screen AND couldn't figure out how to get it off for what seemed like ages!
Had the whole room fighting with each other
everyone was yelling at each other, we were so confused bruh, tubi plays too damn much 😭
Best Ad award goes to Tubi hands down, we all nearly got into a fight when this shit happened 😂😂😂
I was at a party in a car condo where I'm at and I went to get a water outside and everyone was screaming and calling for the host and I was like "wth is happening" and I saw the end of the ad and everyone was like "omfg it was just an ad." So funny 🤣🤣🤣
Nah this was genius. Everone saying how bad it is but it achieved it's goal and got everyone talking about it.
Trust me, my family thought someone messed with the remote.
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
Pure Unadulterated Genius!!! The Best Commercial hands Down💯💯💯💯
Good one Tubi, good one..... perfect timing too
Made me accidentally turn off the tv thinking the remote had gone haywire. Please, never again.
Started a fist fight at my house. I’ll remember forever. Great advertising 👏👏
everyone started tripinnnn 💀😂😂 easily the best commercial.
I missed the Super Bowl, but I heard about this commercial. Thanks for making a memorable and funny commercial. Awesome job!
genius trolling
Hilarious!!!
The paranoia.....😂
I was the one with the remote in my hand, everybody was yelling at the same time 😂
That ad was hilarious. I thought I was sitting on the remote 😂
this is a plot to get people on illegal sports sites to sign up for cable
complete the same action so often watching tubi, thought I did it 🤣 I was like, "dumb azz why you change the game... oh.. just an ad" 🤭🤦🏾‍♂️
Bruh my uncle got really pissed and me and my other uncle were just dying 💀
That’s what you call MARKETING 🗣️👏🏾‼️
This only fooled people who were watching the game on their multi app tv/console. Still, this was pretty funny. I wonder how others reacted seeing this. 😂
I literally thought my house was haunted🤦🏻‍♂️. Didn’t even realize it was a commercial until after the superbowl
You can tell from the start something is off
I also had a heart attack from this
This is one of the best ads I've EVER seen, period. It completely did what it was supposed to, grab the attention of people in an unexpected way. Great job guys!
I was like wth happened. All the damn remotes are on the table??? That was pretty genius actually.
I almost tore my sister head TF off! I yelled turn whatever tf you doing off and put Hulu Live TV back on!
You damn near caused a divorce in my house 😂
We thought the house was haunted!!!
Super Bowl ad winner this year.
I know I know...  You all thought someone was sitting on the remote.
This commercial made me have a heart attack
y’all had me scrambling to my remote thinking my tv was hacked 😂
So tubi is free AND they paid 7.5 mil for our entertainment? We should all download this app.
Some poor kid got hurt during this commercial
I rather watch The Puppy Bowl!! 🐶😊
Had my husband looking at me like I was crazy for turning the TV 😓
I blamed my gf cuz she was sitting on the remote lol
Meh saw this coming along with the M&Ms commercial. 🥱
Mofos got me. I was about to start yelling. 😅
I thought my TV got hacked lol
Yall better watch your windows
Best commercial ever
Literally what happens when you get water on your phone:
😂😂😂
I had a 20 minute delay on the Super Bowl, and when this happened my family was so confused and mad and we had to turn it off and back on, and when we did the delay was gone and it said the Chiefs won the Super Bowl 💀 we didn’t even get to watch the ending
Y’all sleeping on the clearly missing #cancelled streaming provider when the menu pops up. The “Big dog” has been put down. Forget Netflix watch tubi 😮‍💨
Lmfao this was great !!
Ha! Thats great. I missed that ad so i had to look it up on here
My dad started yelling at everyone to see how had the remote
Hilarious!! I was trippin for a minute
Genius
Had everybody freaking out
Fb post brough me here had to see 😂😂😂
Tubi somebody almost lost they life tonight lmao because of this commercial 😂😂
Everyone who has a smartcast tv was hollering 😂😂
I fell for this way to hard
My whole family broke out blaming each other for sitting on the remote. My dad said my brother was but really it was the ad. My dad was also very clearly holding the remote. We all said that we hated Tubi after seeing this ad. I’m still dying of laughter inside.
The commercial interruption heard around the world
I called my friend a fucking idiot
the way i thought someone connected to my tv when this came on
Everyone was yelling at each other. Genius.
I screamed like a madman in the room alone. Take my dislike for that.
That really annoyed me, man. I was sitting there yelling at my kids to stop fkking with the remote. That wasn't nice.
This was such a great marketing commercial lmfaooo it was discussed uo and down my feed on Facebook lol … I was lookin at my tv like wth did I do that lol
Y'ALL got me messed up!
Girlfriend said “BAAABE STOP TOUCHING THE REMOTE”
I thought I had accidentally laid on my remote and turned tubi on lol
Dude that was very realistic
I GOT SHOCKED AND THOUGHT IT THERE WAS A GHOST IN MY HOUSE

Almost had a heart attack looking for my remote 😭
