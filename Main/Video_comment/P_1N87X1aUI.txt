How dominant Izzy was, shows the power Pereira has
izzy you werent fine lol, you would have gotten hurt way worse
none of em like monster..interesting, how come they are sponsored by monster but not show the brand?
Frozen like Elsa..
Only the belt is absent, but, the Champ is still in the house! What a temperament!
Felt like alex got adesanya to focus on those leg kicks. For that fight adesanya needs more takedown Pressure. If adesanya got the Pressure earlier in the fight alex would have trouble timing those kicks. Unfortunate but adesanya was too focused on striking early on. But who am I to know. Not a professional xD. Hopefully we get to see a game changer next time.
You know Bro? They simply fuck you up!! Review the match.. WHY DOES THE REFEREE  STOP YOU WHEN YOU HIT ALEX TWICE IN A ROW AT THE EARLY ROUND.  HE NEVER FALL DOWN.. BRO,  YOU FIGHT UFC ,NOT A BOXING SO THAT A REFEREE WILL STOP THE FIGHT WHEN ITS ROGUE..!!
Can't win em all we fall down but we get up
Adesanya with the cold can of Cope.
Hey You Win Some and You Lose Some and You Keep It Moving
It's Okay Bro Losing Is Part Of Winning/ Like Dying is part of Living / Its a Total Package
I Got TOP-MOST-RESPECT For My Homeboy Adyesanya I Love U Man! Most guys worry abot a perfect 10,20,30,50 With No Lost That's Not Realistic That's NOT You Bro  Why Put That much Pressure on Yurself Just Let it Flow if it happens so B It / Not Being Perfect Frees You Up To Be Yur BEST It Gives You Room For Improvement bcuz again you have nothing to lose that you haven't lost yet / Now Win That Next Fight Bro ☺️🤜🏾🤛🏾👍🏾
“Dare to be great, and I am.” Also from Izzy, “I’m the MOST humble champion.”
The left hook was it  !!!!!!  & Still got hit 8 more hits
He was fighting at the end all knock down.
All other sports no one swears this much. Why ?
Why is he in fancy dress as Dr Zeus?
Si veo un luchador usando un abrigo que proviene de un animal asesinado muy probablemente, ya esta claro que es un imbecil. Me alegro le hayan partido el ego.
Can't do nothing but appreciate his run. And wait for the rematch. Congrats to Izzy for being a true champion.
For adensanya vs pereira 3 let’s do it like the movie “kicker boxer “ and dip their gloves in broken glasses. Let’s do it!!
Gorilla style 😭
Izzy be like.his penis only touched my hole.it didn't went all the way in.thts y I m not gay.
What a dude. Didn't tuck tail, didn't take away from Alex for the W and handled himself with dignity and pride. Which he should, it was an amazing fight from two great fighters. Big champ energy from both 💯
Hey Izzy, I noticed that you seemed scare to him. You don’t have confident in that fight. His skills is below you but you mentally below his
Adesanya ; do not ever allow that guy conner you by the ring.  So long you are moving round the middle of the ring, he cannot beat you. Stay away from the wall . He tries to push to corner to get closer to you and use his long arms and to find just one arm hit.
If the ref let it go longer, Izzy might still be in the hospital. You people must be blind, he was not recovering from that onslaught. He got his ass whooped. Great fight.
Dare to lose again. Please no one wants you to disgrace the belt again. You are so cringy and unbearable.
RIP Adesanya 😭
Style Bender, was Knocked Out, standing up. ☠️ Alex Pereira, will beat him in the Rematch 💯
This man is such a stand up guy. Never complain about being injured n sooo exciting to see fight. This guy is a legend n will never be missed. I believe if Izzy don’t get a rematch 😮 Robert the reaper style would beat Alex. Izzy is seeking revenge now man forget that belt. This guy has nothing to lose
Loven star 🎉🏅
That coat looks ridiculous!  🤦‍♂️🤣 But I would watch anime with this guy anytime.
Adesanya is a great champion of MMA Pereira oh my god x
Is that his girlfriend's coat?
Fur coats are for winners. Looks like a fool
Izzy is someone who is carrying this sport right now with his champion attitude. Glad to have him around and continue competing!
atleast he's got a pimp coat
Israel you no Champion.. you clown 🤮👎
It must piss his opponents off, seeing how he handles a L. Haha the bro doesn’t gaf he just wants to fight
as boring as his fights were at least he was active
A true champion. Respect to his opponent for defeating him.
Finally, glad his corny ass lost been waiting for this one for a minute. Next one I want to see go down is Dana's little sweet booty boy Sean O'Malley.
Izzys cool as I’m fan 4life
ADESANYA!!! Still my hero.
He is a genuine guy and humble too
Finally took a loss thats about it go foreward
Sneaks up on you looking like an orang utan. Can only hope that fur ain't real
It's referee fault ,,,,if you see when adasanya punching continue to Alex then suddenly referee come to stop him,,,,,but. When Alex punching continue to adasanya then referee not stop him why ,,,referee was cheater  If referee not stop adasanya that punching time then 100% Boom 💥 finish  Alex down and sleep forever
Prime example how color doesn’t matter it’s the person it’s their character their personality. EVERYBODY was bummed out Izzy lost !!! He’s still getting g more shine than the new champ how’s that !!!
Liar....you got owned!! And you gonna get owned again!
Sorry, but I can't look past the Orangutan suit.. just horrible.
3:40 bring back steve 5:30 my leg happened
Alex just better and more humble
Beaten twice,by a better fighter.That's what happens if you become arrogant and always trash talking.Afterwards trying to explain why did not deliver as promised
Am glad he's okay and for real he lost and will be back
Hope that not real fur
He looks ridiculous.  😂
Get this Monster outta here first lol
What a wonderful feeling it was to see this guy FINALLY get beat up. He was FORCED to lay it on the line, and he lost. Better than watching his now-usual boring take-no-risk approach that he has adapted. He was done. It would have been nice to see him take a few more....because that's what was going to happen. Take a break Izzy, go get your usual mani-pedi, string those pearls around your neck, watch some anime and drink your own Kool aid as usual.
Haven’t watched the video. But, Is the coat a real fur? If it’s real, a massacre happened to these animals.
Class act
Poatan took everything from you. You should of stay quiet 😆😆
He Boutta come back with the ultimate anime finisher. Mess them power punchers up!
Alex 4th match in UFC n fucked u,,that's it
His best performance because he didn't run away 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
now if he can just lose the coat,whether it’s genuinely lion or fake,he can champion his development towards a sane manhood.Great fighter tho and even if he doesn’t win 2 out of 3 against Pereira  convincingly,he will end up  being more successful than Pereira overall.
Izzy will be back!Great  champ,and real human
He needed some trees to save him that night looking like an orangutang
Massive respect giving his opponent his flowers as well as accepting defeat. Not an Izzy fan but just became one now.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣just doing his best to to run AWAY from the 👉QUESTIONS👈
Bruh wearings a bigfoot fur coat!
Remember lost this fight will only make you better. If he beat you 3 times then you need to look at that weak spot he keep using to get you.
He lost but he’s still a champion fought every single person who wanted smoke 💨 and didn’t give a damn about how risky the opponents were salute
Lol looks  stupid in that thing  hahahah
Well fuck this guy. I have hated him and couldn't wait for him to get knocked out. Now with this interview, I can't help but like him a little
what a man. keep doing what you doing and please be part of this sport we all love
how many animal has to die for this mother fuckers to wear them
if his grappling was better, and maybe Izzy's leg was jacked.. as he said.. cuz he couldn't sink the hooks in. but Pereira looked gassed and done on the floor... I think any grappler puts him to sleep there.
The constant  professional  total class love this guy
Pereira's a true champ, big congrats to him👏👏👏
Still the best…he can make it happen again!
Izzy is a warrior.
respect to izzy as a fighter but why did all those poor pomeranians have to lose their lives for that stupid coat.
He was fucking his ass up the whole fight and then pereira got lucky at the end can’t wait for the rematch kid it’s gonna be fucking sick #andnew
*Izzy talking about his chest and how Chadwick Boseman was made fun of for being skinny and how no one knew what he was going through has me nervous. Ppl need to stop trolling - we just lost Rumble Johnson. Izzy was an continued to be a great Champion.*
Not a fan of Izzy, but he’s never been afraid to fight anyone. And a few more seconds that was a different story. I just don’t think he has the chin for these big guys. He has the power, that’s for sure
Good guy Israel, god bless
Adesanya will get the rematch for sure but seriously Pereira strick game will beat Adesanya 10 times if they do fight again and again just no work for Izzy want beat Pereira respect to both guy's they are warriors but yeh Pereira probably will beat Adesanya again on rematch.
Where’s Steve Mazzagatti when you need him? 😂😂😂
Yeah. What a class act. It was great seeing Alex win the title. But it wasn't any fun seeing Israel lose it, let me tell you. I've always had a lot of respect for Israel, and he's an exciting fighter to watch. Just another twist in the most exciting sport on the planet.
loooosserrrrrrr
Dude looking like King Louie
Legend of the sport.. Dizzy Izzy "The Genderbender" Gynosanya
Izzy out here excersising his right to bear arms.
Super good fighter. Can never cut him short or sell him short he is the real deal and even the best can have a oops at any time.
Win or lose still  great izzy good job humble man even when he lost
Man you guys drink up this clowns kool aid. He’s been making excuses non stop since the loss. He’s faking you all out with this fake humble crap. He’s always saying what he thinks people want to hear, and your all stupid enough to buy it.
You need Jesus Christ. Be a Champignon for God. And his kingdom.  He calls you out from the world. 🕊️🇮🇱🍃🕊️
“Bring back Steve Mazigatti
good no great fighter no doubt Israel.....Mink coats and all that jazz? nah retire quickly 😂
True heart of a champion... Well Said
Is it just me or does it seem like he is having some issues?
You was not lucid you was bowing out
He's definitely the gayest fighter of the UFC
This guy doesnt even come close to Anderson Silva's greatness
Izzy exposed can't style bend when he does t have 7 inches of reach advantage
You just made yourself, his bitch
I'd be more impressed with his BULLCRAP and excuse, but think about it, REALLY?. a MINK COVER? Inter- coursing off HE'S nothing more than an excuse machine, Like CONNOR, NOTHING MORE! Get over yourself. BI- OCH
How many orangutan have to die just to make Adesanya's coat.
Pereira fights pretty stiff but damn that power has got to feel like hell getting hit with.
I loved watching his rise to champ, lost the excitement to watch him during those safe & boring fights, but definitely regained a ton of respect for him after this fight. He looked like early UFC Izzy & tried to finish Alex even though he probably could have played it safe and won the decision. It’s good to see he still wants to put on entertaining fights.
Well u win some u loose some
Mann, izzy has to thank Pereira. Those hits on  izzy's head changed his personality completely. No more big mouth ching chong woo. Woww, this is the new era of humble adesanya. Hahaha 😂
He is in denial. Perdiera has his number. Next fight will be same result. He lost because he was arrogant and didn't fight til the end.
I would say.. for a championship fight i do think the stop was a little early. I feel like olivera was getting hit like that by Chandler but ended up getting up and KOing Chandler.
💡🙏🥋 Israel is a class act 💪 I like what I’m hearing from him he gave Props to his fellow Combatant very humble and respectful in defeat ... and this isn’t the end of a story it’s just a chapter ... He will be back even better  He really is a True Warrior🙏
I feel like Izzy really wanted to knock him out because how dull is last performance was. He really could of made it boring and tried to wrestle him to another unanimous decision victory.
Same energy ? https://youtu.be/OHa8c8-brV4
Class personified
U was f******g fine as u wasn't able to stand properly n hands wraps around Alex neck dangling almost unconcious n if fight wasn't stop at tat moment u could've land in hospital or b like kamaru end.
It's like with every fighter you win most of them and you lose a few and you go on
Piera just on another level, his gas tank is crazy, very lucky win but fkin el what a fight, adesanya is gonna come back with the win with a bit of cardio
nothing but respect IZZY
A master-class in conducting interviews.. completely in control.
Probably one of the most boring fighters ever. He didn’t duck anyone, I’ll give him that. But he didn’t finish fights and would always just wait to counter, if his opponent didn’t move forward, I knew the fight would go to a decision in his favor.
Izzy the man , much respect
I was waiting for izzy too hit with the flying knee especially how Alex was walking him dow.. but great fight both fighters are really humble. Izzy gonna have too bulk up too fight Alex again dude too strong but wen izzy hurt him at the bell izzy should of came in 2nd round   n attack mode
Oh man, he was winning, than played to much. Why?
Not exactly  a fair fight..  Izzy weighed  more than 25lbs  less  than Alex on the fight night..  Alex  is  a  205er  not 185er....    he  would get smashed by Jiri    etc.. Alex is another  ballbag not fighting at his natural weight class...
3 fights in 10 months? Utmost respect for this guy
Elsa,I mean izzy, I think he's got ur number.🥶💤🥶💤🥶
See that's not a sore looser and is honest and humble and isn't arrogant he knows he's a beast 💪 adesayna gives that respect and always is a great sportsmanship  recognize where credit is due. He is so calm and well spoken what a cool dude a gentleman at the end. He's not crying for spilled milk. He will come back soon
He had to go because he was getting too hot in that jacket made out of Tibetan Mastiff.
If you weren’t a fan you have to be now
Why all the praising? Wasn't this guy recently on steroids?  Also he is douchebag towards many of his opponents.
Respect to Izzy , I wonder what he is dealing with his health? Hopefully all is well, I really started respecting Izzy the last year.
Respect to Izzy , I wonder what he is dealing with his health? Hopefully all is well, I really started respecting Izzy the last year.
His coat looks like an orangutans fur
Respect he’s the champ no matter what happens
He’s hurt mentally after that 3-0 for sure. I’ll be back.
It takes two to tango...great job Izzy....you and Alex made that fight great and entertaining...and I also believe the stoppage was justified....🙂💯💥👍🤙
@4:01 - Is he talking about having gyno / man boobs here? really interested
All these African guys with the fur coat and jewellery . Please . What a sign of weakness
Everybody relax, pereira is a f n trash can bruh yes people might say he hasn’t really been in mma for that long but your wrong I’m sure he’s train for a good enough time for someone to become pro with n still he’s trash he just got “that trash can strength” he got no skill at all no generalship no patience no balance he’s a truck that’s it but let a truck hit you at full speed n of course but other than that he’s ass!😂
“Bring back mazzagotti, I’d still be champion” 😂😂😂 it’s true tho 😂😂
Much respect izzy
Izzy fought his ass he just got caught after his leg was comprised it’s pretty dumb Izzy had Alex done in the first round if there was a few seconds left
It was hard to see Izzy loss a fight. You dont have to win against all the fighters to be the true Champion. You have proved yourself as the very best in the division,  one more win and that should be ok to hang the belt.
Pierrier fought like the champion  and Izzy fought like the challenger. Pierrier took centre stage although   Pierrier was behind, he was more confident and got Izzy to work too hard and got him gassed out.  Time out is the way forward.
Izzy take time out, Pierrier is a guy that will always pose a problem to beat. The fighting styles are different. I think the fight was lost at the face off. Let Robert Whittaker beat Pierrier then come back to beat Whittaker.   Pierrier will always pose a problem for Izzy.
"Bring back Steve Mazzagatti and I would still be champion. I'd have lost the round but still been a champion." - LOL
Alex made frozen like Elsa 🤣
No excuses..fans you too no excuses for him..
He look like that nigga from He-Man
a true fucking legend. i used to hate izzy, but he's turned me into one of his biggest fans. truly one of the all time greats, maybe the best middleweight ever. i think he wins a rematch
If he has 5 more sekonds in the 1 Round he woud be still the Champ.
Elsa boi was truly grateful!!!
crap
Oh you mean the hook right after the bill yeah that one yeah that anybody would fall to a sucker punch
Brad who ridell the one who got rocked?!
Geez these excuses are killing me hahaha come on man
News flash we all have situations in our life that we have to deal with but when something happens to us we keep going you're nothing special this is a job you chose this is what you wanted to do in life so stop your crying, look at the late great Anthony Rumble Johnson who would have known he had it and wasn't bitching a crown of money in about anything the dude is a king and went out like a king
By the way don't insult Chadwick Boseman by putting your name in the same sentence that dude was a humble graceful human being
Salute ro Israel.  He's  a true champion even in defeat. A message fo the haters: Everyone loses in this game.
Fuckin Prolo
‘He’s going to cry when he gets in the car.”  Respect to Izzy, and best wishes to him.   Also, congrats to the new champ.
Dare,to be Great 🤔💪👍 next time Ziggy hahaha Izzy
TOOK THAT L LIKE CHAMP  NO EXCUSES MUCH RESPECT
They literally keep asking him the same questions in different ways.. i see why these fighters get annoyed
The cloth he is wearing is it from real animal or synthetic does anyone know??
These goddamn stoppages are getting ridiculous.  There's been several stopped on the feet. There's out on your feet and in trouble.  I think Israel was in trouble. F'n 5th round and a hugeeeeeee title fight too
Izzy gained more respect in loss than he would have in victory. the stoppage was 100% valid, Joe and DC nailed it when they said Alex could have thrown a knee and put in on ice. what the hell is that coat tho...epic post fight wardrobe
He would come back
Big respect to izzy. but who's gonna beat alex hes a real machine and total animal brilliant .fight 2 true warriors
He just compared himself to Chadwick having cancer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why putting you're guard down. Only Muhammad Ali could do that. That has cost his belt.
He ain't got all that smoke now. FBA B1
Such a class act
The higher you fly the harder you fall !! You very well deserved your TKO lost ....
Perreira is a beast.. He has Adesanya Number. The only fighter on the roaster you can 100% bet on.
Respect for izzy he took it well
Absolute the best role model in ufc....
Nice Elsa jacket
Fear is real. He looks pale even in the staredown. Its mental. Alex is renting free.
I'm scared of Alex because I use to think Izzy was gone be our new Bruce or something. LoL! Not funny because I still respect and love Izzy! And there can never be another Jordan, Bruce, or any other goat!    What hurts me the most is that they got the mic on a broken 💔/spirit rn. Izzy we love you bro and you loss well my beloved African brother. Stay encouraged and go spend $40,000 (cash racks) to the Honorable Gracie's (Horce Gracie) and see if you can live on their camp also because they training is a way of life! And then come back in a year and conquer the whole damn UFC!!! And trust me Izzy this message is so Divine!  "Better a diamond with a flaw  than a smooth round pebble without"    -Confucius  Proverbs 9:9
I must have watched a different fight cause I felt like Alex controlled most of the fight.....He didn't dominate the fight but he controlled the pace and kept Izzy at bay
Nice use of buzz words. Complete Clown!
This fight was Almost identical to Edwards - Usman. Izzy will be smarter and probably win the rematch. Also I see Whittaker and Marv giving Pereira a hard time on the ground
While i know my thoughts are meaningless to izzy, Absolute respect to the "King of the Middleweights" . I think we could all take a lesson from his mentality in victory and defeat. No matter where his journey leads him. He won a lifelong fan with his performance and leadership in the shadows of a gut wrenching defeat.
Elsaaaaaaaaaaa….
😀😀😀😀 I thought it was Grace Jones.
This man will be back and more dangerous than ever, scary stuff
we need to talk about his choice in jackets.
Skills wise he really is a better striker he just doesn’t have that same power.
Izzy is always his own best spokesman... intelligence and class
The most humble loss from an a true champion!  RESPECT 🙌🏾
Man no wonder Henry cejudo had to come back this dude been out here gunning to be the king of cringe
There's an Oranatang out there looking for his fur back rn. Coat looks hella warm g.
Bro’s recovery is too damn op
Elsa let it go..😁😅 No matter how good your skill, how creative you are, how you play mind games. When Pereira lands one good punch, it comes to an end soon.
I am from Nigeria yet I am this happy Nigerians are loosing. I stated he was going to loose while he was a champ. the moment he reckoned with Nigeria away from Ireland that made him, that's it for him and so was for kamaru and Anthony Joshua. Reckoning with Nigeria is Bad luck.
I the only one who prefer no rematch? POATAN needs move to lhw, and Robert vs Izzy 3 for the title, izzy with Win chalenger poatan at LHW , better than poatan izzy again, probably izzy needs recover
hahahaha yes yes yes adesanya loss
Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Roy Jones Jr, Bruce Lee and so forth "we all seen greats for before" nothing new except Floyd Mayweather
And he really thought he was going to beat Jon Jones 🤣 .decent fighter but it's good that he bowed down and away from Jon because it wouldn't be competitive..
Izzy a good sport, and naturally humble after losing (what Izzy deems as the prestigious belt). But the fur coat is really ridiculous after getting KO’d after talking all that shit about Alex. And even though it took him 5 rounds, Alex 💯has Izzy’s number! I see the rematch going the same way.
Atleast Izzy actually fought that fight, made me a fan again, I’m excited for the rematch. So happy the stoppage was like that, if he were put out cold, he would’ve had to take a lot more time off and wouldn’t have half a chance in the next fight.
Not a loin. Look like a fox
I hope that is fake fur.
If there's a bonus for 'coat of the night' Israel wins
Glad he lost
I had it 2-2 in the final round. Way closer fight than everyone is saying it was. round 1 Izzy, round 2 Alex, round 3 Izzy round 4 Alex, Then the KO, great fight.
Adesanya he fights the best win some loose some much respect he is still one of the best.
Tennis ball training result
These journos are so shit omg. The guy literally said his leg got compromised about 5 times then this bozo says what happened end of the fight LOL
Know it has nothing to do with Izzy but RIP Anthony Johnson.
No worries No problems ,hold your head up high ,one of the best if not the best to do it in my opinion, Nothing is impossible  apart from defeating the Creator ! So whatever you decide to put your energy into ...burn secret 🔥🔥🔥  & If u ain't retiring anytime soon make the OGUN proud of your mentioning ,seen!   Great battle .
Issi is actually the middleweight GOAT
He almost finished him, saved by the bell
That rematch is going to be cuuuh razy!
Izzy said he sound s like Rob yuk Well now he knows how it feels
Birch might look like a grizzly here but he sure didn't fight like one
He compared himself to a guy who was fighting cancer, like really? I'm glad he got rocked, he lives on a different planet
Excuses excuses
hes the man..he makes me proud to be a kiwi.. he never lets us down and the main thing he never lets himself down...the champ
Izzy's coming back with a full silicone DD rack.
John should be the last one until doesn’t start to respect himself and goes to the gym .
Such a boring it was tbh till the end
Izzy is azzome. Very inspiring.
Look at what he's wearing!! Look at the way he acts! Nothin but arrogance! Thinks hes better than everyone an that's why he lost!
Oh man i feel so bad for him losing to the same guy for the third time... Then i looked at his paycheck and the huge fucking mansion he lives in. And already feel a lot less bad haha..
I like Issy allot but fur coats In 2022??? Wtf
Class act me bollix,he did says to Eugene his coach that he hate that guy (Perreira) and bounce off before Rogan interview.
Adesanya is phenomenal. In and outside the cage
Lol typical, fack everybody else he says, that include the fans who you need to buy your chewbacca coat? The ego getting like mcgregors as well. Also a good stoppage.
After Winter comes Spring. Refocus, Rehydrate, Reinvigorate, Rematch!  Let's go Israel Adesanya. New Zealands no1 Son. Keep the Faith!
Concerning about the health stuff he mentioned. Praying for you Izzy🙏🏼💪🏼
Respect
Izzy-first thing first, move this stupid monster bottle 😂.
This is what happens if you mock Jesus. I don’t understand how some Christians can support this guy, he talk bad about Jesus in Tweet. Those who support this guy knowing he mock Jesus will go to hell. My prayer answered by his lost.
It was a competitive fight, Izzy could definitely win the rematch. He deserves the immediate rematch.
Izzy a likeable dude though I'm no fan. Went out like a true champ. Glad ref wouldn't allow him to get life flighted outta that arena
there is nothing to say Israel, Alex vs Israel is 3 - 0, 2. KO 1 by UD
This was one of the best fights I have seen in a while, truly epic from both guys.
"people always make fun of me because of my chest"  First: Man that's a Gyno .. 100% has to do with supplements whether these are illegal or not, so stop saying that !   Second: you wouldn't stand for extra 2 seconds, he would have most probably kneed your face and that's unnecessary extra brain damege, you were gone sir and that's a fact.  Third: you were active?? bro people boo'ed you twice for running in the middle of the fight .. You had 5 title defences if I'm not mistaken, which is impressive, and YES this is your best fight ever because you didn't run and you fought like a warrior, props mate, BUT before this fight you had a totally different style, an awful one tbh.  Alex deserved this win in alk fashion
If he keeps his back off the cage in the rematch he wins his title back, maybe even gets a KO if Alex can figure out a counter to his one-twos.
I think Alex is on steroids. His recovery is ridiculously fast
Izzy lost Alex took him to hell city got to give him respect best stoppage izzy was seconds away from going to sleep that man body was fold until ref came in
Great fight!!! Hat off for both fighters!!!
what is he wearing? must be cold
his sportsmanship is on another level, still my man
What a fight! It was so entertaining!
I feel Izzy should take some months off and let Alex fight Whittaker. Robert should cancel the Pualo fight.
Izzy froze up alot in this fight,stayed on the cage to much.Izzy couldn't let his hands go i feel.Hes def got the tools cause Alex is a beast but very 1 dimensional.
Good for you Izzy the big mouth hahaha, Pereira prove you're nothing against him rematch not needed hahaha..
Why's he wearing an orangutan suit?🤔
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Big Mouth he ain't no Kiwi he's a refugee
Crazy how up and down a fight can be. We are talking about how well Alex did but Izzy would be champion if there were 5-10 seconds more in the first round. He was definitely winning after four rounds too. That being said, Alex recovers so well and he’s one of those fighters who is always dangerous as he punches/kicks soo hard. It must be a nightmare being stuck in the cage with a beast like that and the way he continues to come forward even after four rounds of brutal striking. If Alex can work on his ground game then he’s going to be a champion for a while.
Is this going to lead to trilogy?
What a pro, bro, damn.
U made history in UFC  among best if not the best. As a champ he had kept five to six championship defend record.defeated Kelvin Gastelum along side this great men who made there own impact too Robert Whittaker twice, Yoel Romero, Paulo Costa, Marvin Vettori, and Jared Cannonier. Much respect. We all lose to rise again take the lost and rise again brother. much ❤️🇳🇬
Lol why are you wearing an Orangutan jacket????
Respect to you CHAMP…!!
C'est bien une défaite pour toi frère tu étais devenu un peut farfelue 😅 mais je crois que tu reviendras en forme
Be strong israel
It's good to get humbled in life once in awhile
"Bring back Steve Mazzagatti!" 😆😆😆😆😆 Epic!  Still classy in defeat and ready to regroup.
one thing you gota recognize, Israel Adesanya keeps it real man. he pushes himself to speak his inner truth, hes not a front or a actor man. I can tell this dude is real
1 million views already  🤯
No he checked you're leg kick izzy. Get it right
Respect to Izzy!
Please add the subtitles
ADESANYA & PEREIRA are both, Great WARRIOR'S.
That fur coat looks like a big foot costume.
He has a weird squint a couple times. I noticed it during the weight in too. Worries me
Izzy has too much fancy not humble his losing his best performance
You can't fault a guy that goes for greatness. Alex just won tonight. Two incredible fighters
Izzy a class act man
Israel heading to Burning Man
Izzy carries himself with a class that is rare. One of the best Champions in UFC history.
finally someone tells John its not a 1 on 1 interview
Dare to be Great.
Alex looked a lot bigger and massive during the fight
Nothing but respect for this man. A true legend.
That coat's sick where's it from?
His resilient mentality after this loss is incredible.  Definitely want to see the rematch - even if Pareira really does have his number.  This fight was very competitive.
EARLY STOPAGE!!!
Wait he should’ve finish Alex in the 1st round but he was playing around
You watch didn't match your outfit, same as your proud. You should learn how to be humble.
When you wear a lions mane after a loss that's when you know you're greater than a game
I hope you see this izzy, I didn't like you to start, for no reason. But now I realize you are a real champ, you are exactly what it is to be a champ. Because the champ becomes your hero. I am ⁴6 years old, but today after your loss,  you are my hero, my champion.  I'm sure for many others too.
If the ref let's it go he would have had his head bounced off the mat and all his fans would be yelling why didn't the ref stop it earlier!  I mean izzy saying he was still in it I guess he had the hands down head down strategy goin on ahhh!!
Great fight. Would have won  but you got to keep your high guard up with a puncher
I was wondering why Izzy was staying up against the cage so much after the 3rd round. Alex hitting his nerve makes that make sense now. Alex's power, discipline and recovery is insane. I still think Izzy outclasses him next time which is crazy. Izzy truly is the standard for all UFC champions and if he wins the rematch then the world will go insane.
No offense but I would suggest not to tarnish your record by losing four in a row. Get used to being a contender for a while and take your belt back bro
Izzy will avenge. I like him even more after this fight... respect
Dare to be Frozen Like Elza
perneal nerve?
Izzy has cancer
izzy should have three four fites w alex
This guy ain’t nothing but a Clown, coming out dressed Like a Pimp, after Pereira Kod his ass,🤣🤣.
Glad he got knocked the f out !!! Cocky and braggadocious finally caught up with him😂😂💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
got humbled lol
Poatan won the fight fair and square...but DC and Rogan are right...they're gonna have to run it again!!!
If he didn’t have that trip / fall he be ok.
What a beast this guy! Strong mental game! Wow!
It's seems no matter what sport it's been a commonality to suspect the event was fixed 🤔⁉️
I guess they knock the paint out of his nails🤣🤣
If he dies he dies- Mario Yamasaki,, Imagine he’s the referee that night😢
Mario Yamazaki for the last/next fight! S2
Izzy will be back on top, just give him time.
What can I say here that hasn't been articulated a thousand times about Izzy.  I love Izzy and he is one of the living legends of the sport, possibly the greatest.  Congrats to the other guy also.  Gather yourself mentally Izzy after this incomprehensible defeat.  Other fight immortals have accomplished this.  You will too.
When did tthis fight happen?
Love this guy, I fucking hate he lose. We’ll get em next time style bender
Izzy is literally the best in the business. Champion of champions. 🖕 all the haters.
Got love this guys attitude
Glad his arrogant ass got KO!!!!!! Dance to that trick
Rest up champ. Come back and dominate him. Go on another run. Move up in weight after
Alex outstriked him. Worked the body and the legs. Went to the head to put him out. Alex will win rematch. 1st round was his but the last 10 seconds swayed it. Alex was solid in 4th round too. He's gonna murder Adesanya in rematch.
He's very good at hiding his pain and feelings inside he's hurt af
Izzy is the man.
Oh come on Israel, you are truly sportsmanship.
Stop wearing animal fur 🖕🏻
Man I just knew it was over after round 4. He had it in the bag. I was like “already Izzy just don’t get hit cuz he’s coming with everything” and he got hit smh so disappointing but he did a great job! Truly a champs champ. Hope he gets it back.
“” Forgot To 😫😫😫ACEPT🫥🫥🫥You GOT Kicked ***👉3👈 👁️😱👀Just SAID as Every Other Existing Witness your Ass Gotten KICKED ¡¡¡ AGAIN !!! Be The SAmE “”Simple Kick Boxer”” As You Call Him 🗣️🖕🖕🖕👻
0-3 and you want a rematch?
Is that an Orangutan fur?
stays arrogant even after a loss, gotta love this guy
Izzy is the man.
o brasil é um lixo
I like what he said. He can do his lap around without having something to lose like being the champ. I feel that there will be more entertaining fights from him now
Lol.... remember that while getting someone's leg fucked to gaurd your leg bro...lol
Francis Nganou you're next , be ready  2 down 1 to go
Why did Izzy ghost the monster drink????   Real fast
I don't get why so many dumb asses hate him so much
Very classy in defeat
The way he handles a loss is  Godly. Soo much respect for Izzy
Some people just have your number
And he wanted to face Jones lol
Anyone takin time in keybord hatin on Izzy or any of these fighters (especially in the top 10) really need  sh!t goin on in their lives.
If Izzy had a better ground game he might have won. I believe after his last fight which was boring he went for it in standup but Periera was too strong.
Izz you are a true warrior. A very humble one. It was a good fight, but you know to call the fight what it was. Those calf kicks were brutal and I know you will know how to avoid and to counter them the next time you two meet in the ring again. Good job, be safe....
he dipped after the fight
Lost gallantry
Still one of the greats, great respect and back hunting for that championship belt. 💪  Congrats to the new champ, he too will be a problem in this game. 💯
Love him or hate him, man is a class representation of being a champion.
Alex humbled him 😂
Everyone would’ve been shitting on Alex if he got whooped lol all these izzy cok riders some frauds
Wtf Is he wearing Shaka Zulu
He may have been lucid but if it wasn’t stoped the next punch would have been bad.
That was a great stopage! He gotta be out of it still...
this is why people love you izzy
Alex P is dangerous. He picks his spots like a sniper. First round he landed a kick to Isreal throat, but used his big toe as a Dagger. At the end of the round pay attention and then watch isreal neck while in the corner😮😮😮😮
excuses excuses.. he's leg wasn't the problem,  problem was the gas tank and that he got rocked, wobbled and Pereira was all over him. and no Izzy you weren't clear, you where out
Israel stopped boxing in 5th round..
Chewbacca got knocked the FUC OUT!!!
Alex is better. Now Texeira Champ. Next ... Pereyra vs Texeira for both belts 🤩
This reminds me of Roy Jones vs Tarver . Tarver was that one opponent that gave Roy issues in the amateurs. In the 2nd fight Roy dominated in the center of the ring but when he got against the ropes he was the most vulnerable and took multiple shots until he got caught. I know it’s a difficult task against a skillful opponent but Izzy needed to keep the distance. It’s was too much of a risk to let such a towering opponent who has a similar reach to yours to come in so close and fight with your back against the cage. He got away with it with shorter opponents because he had the reach advantage but Alex was much bigger and he looked a bit taller than Izzy with a 70 inch reach and he’s very skilled fighter and that was the difference in my opinion. Plus Izzy should have brought the fight to him and kept him on his back foot but that’s easier said than done but they say sometimes your best defense is a good offense. Much respect to Izzy . You’re still a champ my guy
Is that Bigfoot? 🤔
Izzy is a great champion he will return the champion again! Congrats to new champ ! Izzy didn’t duck or run from nobody!  Izzy is great!
Real UFC fans and real Isreal fans know this is the game go back work hard and get back to it but all these pussy haters will talk shit well, just keep talking.
Bro that was the rematch and you lost it
love him but he last this time
I wouldn’t rematch he’s lost 3 times already I would move to someone else
nah you just lost...its obvious
Israel has all the tools to beat Alex, he's far more talented. Only a matter of time. What Izzy is missing is the ability to control distance better against someone his own height because he's used to fighting shorter guys. Better range management and better wrestling skills and Alex  is a gonner. That said, Alex is the perfect prey for someone like Khamzat who loves to wrestle. Alex needs now to work on his wrestling because guys like Khamzat are salivating at how weak he is in that department.  It will be interesting the next 12 months for sure.
God that coat is embarrassing.
Yeah gyno doesn't get treated with time it's only gonna get worse Unless it's not natural gyno, and it's caused by peds 👀
Im not a fan of him but I appreciate how he takes a loss
I got one of those hairy jackets i kill a sasquatch so they can make me one with my bare hands to the fighter. Talking u got humble for being cocky
I was fine... I was seeing 3 of them, but yeah i was fine
CHEWBACCA SHAVED
Izzy fought a guy who had his number and still wanted to face him again. 0-3 against Alex all-time I think. For Izzy it was never about the belt , it was about beating Alex. Just an opinion.
Thats one of the best womans coats of all time!!!!
WTF? His best performance? He fucking panic wrestled and didn't know wtf he was doing on the ground lol.
steve mazagatti lmfao
Bro lost to alex 3 times and he still talks like its all chance
You are a great
If he was fine why didn't he talk to Joe after his loss.
Bro look corny asf 🤣
He thought he was Goat....🥴🥴🥴  When khabib got belt u defeated 29-0 People said he is Goat.. this guy bluffed saying NO.. and thought himselft to be Goat ... Now the same guy defeated him twice..
He knocked you out take it as a man… fair and square he destroyed you. If you still stay cocky you will loose again.
He fck you up be humble about it atleast say something about the guy who beat you
With that coat on he looks like a ......oh, I can't say it. It's 2022
It amazing me how you ppl talk about Usman and this arrogance he supposedly had when in fact Izzy is super arrogant and losing but y'all love him. Makes no sense
fake humble clown finally got humbled !!!! 🇧🇷
The Steve Mazagati line was hilarious
Don’t like Izzy but man my respect is so high for him right now, wow he took that one on the chin
RIP rumble.
I can't lie, I wanted to see izzy lose, but now what a great story it would be for izzy to win the rematch
If he comes back and beats Alex he’s in the hot conversation for me this guys special
Izzy is cool AF ! The champ!
Your the man izzy and you will get him on the next one. Legend period.
Energy my ass. Israel can go fight jake Paul. Jake Paul fight all the ufc looser
How could anyone not like Israel? He has the best attitude, he's real, he's smart, and I always root for him.
His "wrestling" ?? Bwahaaahaahhaa.... yeah okay 👍
Alex did a ultra combo on izzy.
Wow Alex really messed him up look his now dressing like a woman pearl necklace and all ...talk about making him your biiitch . I knew it all along Izzy is a creep
Was happy Alex won but we love you Izzy!
when he punches he drops his arm down, he does not hide his chin behind forearm or shoulder . he relies on youth to pull away from punches no defense , does not check kicks and counter not enough combining of hands and feet after watching glory kickboxing the striking is on an amateur level
Love you izzy
Oh ye lost hecase of health issues. It was only a matter of hours before that came out.
Izzy and usman fighting back for the belt would be a great card
What the fook is he wearing?
ISREAL WAS SCARED THE WHOLE FIGHT. HE HUGGED ALEX ALL NIGHT?
I AM SO TIRED OF ISRAEL'S ARROGANCE? HE TRY'S SO HARD TO ACT BETTER THEN OTHER PEOPLE
Is he a Orangutan ?
It was so refreshing to see Izzy perform to the level we knew he was able to. Yeah he lost, but it was great to see he didn’t just coast the fight
He's talking like that because he got his knot rocked and he's still woozy lol.
Bem arrogante. Parabens Alex.
We would have had a new champ a while ago but this coward ran at full speed away from the *SOLDIER OF GOD YOEL ROMERO*
Ppl don't understand... Izzy is one of the best strikers... To lose to Poatan isn't even a something to be hurt about. It's a part of the game
Fake humble. Did not keep the same energy at all
Went defensive round 5? Why?
Can’t wait to see the rematch.
that man is hurting 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
his happy???????????? 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm finally glad to see the the got bullied as a kid and than became what he despised. Which is a fucking cocky bully get knocked out. If you become what you despise you deserve what you get. God is good
Big respect to Izzy. That’s how a Champion handles defeat. Thank you for the example.
Izzy is a true champion , love his mindset , one of the best fighters of all time , I'm glad I get to witness greatness , shout our to perreira as well , tremendous fighter
How'd they get that orangutan to give a press conference!?
great attitude champ. you’ll be back soon.
Izzy won.
Elsa was on skates
That coat 🔥
Izzy acts extra sometimes but he is a true champion and fighting legend and deservers all the respect, hell get it back
er  det hybridulv skinn eller bjørneskinn????
someone tell that fool how stupid he looks in that, whatever it is.
chewbaka lost AMEN AS WE SAID ALEX WOULD PICK HIM APART!! 3 in a row AMEN-
They'll probably have a rematch.
When did Izzy become an American?
EGO!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
How's the dead animal your wearing
The rematch is yours buddy
Alex beat him 3 times 😅 Izzy will never be champ again and that must sting
alex was rocked for sure and had terrible movement and defense at end of first  couldve ended   but alex recovery is crazy   he could be a monster at 205  and not killing himself
That’s what he gets for tryna play touch butt and run away like he’s been doing since the costa fight…  Dude had it in the bag until he lost his killer instinct and try to play paddy cake with a killer😂 I mean Jared cannonier nearly caught izzy in the 5th too dudes gotta quit victory lapping in the championship rounds…   It’s karma for juicing up his little titty too💀💀💀
That coat is dope. Needs a hat though imo 🔥
Izzy, nothing to be ashamed of man, you are a great champ and I think Alex caught you in that flurry, the fight could have gone either way. It was a very entertaining fight and I would like to see a rematch happen.
If izzy managed to survive which was pretty much 100% not going to happen… it’d have been a 10-8 round it still would have been a draw lol
Alex keeps fuckin this guy up 👏 he sounds like he needed his ass kicked anyway😂
You say I keep the same energy after you are beaten,what does that mean, you are still in denial over the victory made by your opponent,man you should at least show some respect ,defeat is defeat thanks
Nothing but respect for Izzy, Pereira haunts my nightmares and he went out there on the world stage and stood toe to toe with the most powerful and scariest man on the planet
Can't win them all😊
Izzy the goat 🐐 props to both fighters💯
Why is no mentioning the awesome jacket
Humble in victory, gracious in defeat. Thank you for your performance sir!
I never like or agree with Izzy but that was a bad stoppage!!
Amazing how MMA fans work. Not too long ago he was boring and a terrible champ. Suddenly now the tunes changed. Glad you've changed your tune anyway.
He will be champ again. He is a Champion. Champions acknowledge , recover,  make change, and get back in,  and take the belt back.
Always a killer - he took on all comers including Alex.
Thats how you handle a loss. He will be back.
I wish I could pull off a coat like that. Shit looks mad comfy
Izzy took this shit like a champ sad he lost but I know he will be back dude just gotta energy you appreciate
Early stoppage
You got to love Izzy, always up for the Challenge, already casting for a Bigfoot Movie role minutes after a fight. Chase the 💰.
No rematch get rid of this guy
Great sport. Was a perfect stoppage.
Alex saw that when he got up against the cage izzy would escape to the right and you can see in round 3 Alex saw it and that quick left jab he threw stopped izzy going right and forced izzy to go left to get out
Izzy throwing away this monsters is amazing lol. GSP used to do that too and it’s a giant middle finger to a company that doesn’t do jack shit for 90% of fighters
#Humble Champion 🏆  Top 5 UFC Fighter Of All time :  1. Jon 'Bones' Jones  2. George 'Rush' St Pierre  3. Alex Perriera  4. Khabib 'The Eagle' Nurmagomedov  5. Leon Edwards   Humble Champion 🏆 🥇 🏅 Sambo vs Greko
He can’t even speak after 1hr! He is still on another dimension 😅
Izzy has and always will have a glass chin the prob he has never really been tested how he was lastnight Plus if Dan didn't stop it who knows maybe he still be out he just doesnt like to admit defeat he to cocky well he knocked your ass out once and he told u before the fight he going to knock your ass out again and he kept his word
he was absolutely not okay in any fashion. he's got the heart of a champion though so tough to blame him. kinda glad he got saved though, a bad ko would have changed him
You were fucking done, bro. You were winning but he catches you bad
You know what. He's taking it well and that's good to see.
Dude should indeed be thankful to the ref. Could've gotten flattened like Reyes and have his whole career fucked over. He didn't get KO'd so he lives to fight another day.
I guess the rematch will be big, and adesanya will regain his title via unanimous decision the next time he fights periera
For wearing that coat, I'm glad he lost
the coat better be fake
I think Adesanya needs to be more aggressive on putting people away. Pereira is too dangerous to keep around for five rounds. Example when he had Pereiras back  on the ground, he had the upper hand clearly and never once went for a finish.
Adesanya is clear of Alex as a complete fighter. Alex just has that equaliser & two fucking play to him bruv. But gutted for Izzy
U still the man
The only problem he had in that fight was his approach the final round. He gave that fight up. How didn’t he know after being up in at least 3 of 4 rounds that the guy wouldn’t come out with nothing to lose.
Well at least we all found big foot.
This doofus can't figure out if he has a kiwi American or english accent
took that like a champ l
Fact is he won most of the fight and will be the favorite in the rematch showed he can also ko Alex fairly early it won’t be long befor izzy is champ again
Why he stayed near the fence so much instead of running as always?
its nice to see izzy humbled. he was turning into another UFC caricature. this loss is good for him. see you soon for the rematch izzy. stay humble.
Let’s bring ufc to Brazil
Even though this dude is the king of clowns, and never shows any offense in any fight ever. I do commend that he doesn't turn down an opportunity to run away and throw leg kicks. What a champ.
This is what happens when ur a champ who doesn’t take steroids and faces all challenges. He beat a lot of hard contenders and I think he can come back and win it again. He almost won this one,
Granny coat, house wife pearls and hooker nails... how long until he starts wearing skirts?
IZZY U R STILL LEGEND IN OUR EYES MAD RESPECT TO YOU BROTHER....;!!
Izzy earned my respect after his loss. Fought a fairly entertaining fight, and was graceful in defeat.
Izzy will be back👊🏻
WE ALL PROUD OF YOU IZZY
Why is he wearing a grizzly Bear?
Respect.
What a champ, solid solid guy what a fight everyone who watched was a winner includeing the fighters, outstanding
Ur mistake is don't get pin close to the fence.
Adesanya sure is stylish, I've never seen an Orangutan fur coat before this.  Now I see why he is called Stylebender
He really pulled a Usman 5th round 😢
Couldn't wait any longer to see Adesanya having what he deserves. Hats off to Alex Pereira to provide this moment specially for Brazilian fans.
Im glad he got humbled
I thought he was going to do something special he told all of us?? More like Alex
What a wanker is wankersanya.. 'I was fine....'...geez
realistically no chance he was going to recover with bombs crashing on his dome, 10 more seconds and he would be out COLD
I love Izzy! Pure class! I know he will remain on the top of this division. The dude is too good to go anywhere.
Usman and Israel both lost this year. I was hoping the Nigerians kept the belt still.
You’re a great fighter Adesanya however, this is a different fighter that you faced again and his power is just unbelievable. Expecting the same outcome in the rematch. 4x0
You look  better not saying anything he got you 3 times but u wanna to be in he's face n look what happens u got yourself knocked out just like this time before, stop being  so cocky, next  time he's going to be more prepared  that's 3 - 0.
Removes the monster water lol
classy dude right there
Hahahahahha
I always say adesanya is not real champion because he always run then attack,run then attack ,,,but in this fight against Alex he shows that his a reall champion too because he fight  Alex toe to toe ,,face to face ,,no running away ,,
I love my boy but you need a boxing trainer to be honest add that to the fighting techniques
Got owned move on bro...
Good man Izzy 💪🏿
With all due respect champ you were not fine man it was bad bad.
Respect to both fighters for leaving it all in the cage!
CKB guys always say it is a early stoppage lol Izzy was boutta get his lights out out if they let alex tee off him any more tbh
Izzy keep your head up, you are a bad ass, you will get the strap back.
Another Muslim Champion with Pereirra. Crazy.
Izzy with the excuses was great to see him get knocked out
People being ppl n not doctors, don't know that pituitary Adenomas are prbly the most common cause of male gynaecomastia. And finally Israel hinted at a fact that he may hve cancer n need treatment. All this time he's being accused of PEDs. Kudos to him, I like his Stoic philosophical approach to all the noise.
I wanted this idiot to lose so bad but now after his demeanor and language in this press conference I feel bad for him and want him to get it back
Kia kaha my bro, youll get it back
Adensanya is a true class act that manages to stay gracious even in defeat. Once they run it back I guarantee he'll prove the naysayers wrong and get back his title.
Class act!!!!
Yeah stay humble izzy a proud warrior in defeat i respect u even more
Very professional response by the former champ.  Fought like a pro and handled the loss really well.
Humble in defeat  ....some fans are clowns ...  he has to LOSE to get your respect?  Fake fans....same people JUST trashing him, Not long ago
I love he takes the monster away. He hates the owner so much he's not advertising for him at all. Every time
Izzy solid!!! "Same energy" No hating or excuses!!! #Respect
"Bring back Steve Mazzigatti" Understatement of the year. Good on the champ to keep a level head on his shoulders after his streak ending like that. 1 of the greatest of all time in the sport. He maybe dying on the inside right now but puts on the best pokerface & shows sportsmanship even when it isnt deserved. Stay up champ 🔥
My champ
Atleast beat Alex one time before you retire
When you are Muslim ur heart is sooooooooooooooooooooo strong no one can defeat you 💪✌️✌️✌️✌️prra Is the husband
Israel is such a true champion. Took this L so humbly and positive. I hope he comes back and give the weight class more entertainment.
Izzy missing a belt with that fur coat. What the hell is he thinking  wearing that. Out of touch with reality
I will always support king Izzy
The most boring fighter on the planet, finally someone took his boring ass out. Lets goo 🔥 Team Alex
I still have respect for this guy. He was a great champion and it takes a lot of mental fortitude to face a guy you lost to twice, get knocked out again, lose the belt and still do interviews post fight.
incredible fight, incredible champion Izzy,
Great fight, I think Izzy can beat him in the rematch.
Took the loss pretty well but this coat is questionable. Probably had it planned for post fight presser when he won. Lmao wow
What a "funky" outfit!
Is that really an orangutan fur?
3-0
If Ref hadn’t stopped it, A knee was on the way to turn the lights off!!…..
Bro Izzy really used to make me mad because he had major potential but i felt like he was not challenging himself. He was getting on my nerves to with the corny punchlines and finger nail 💅 stuff. But he's really deep. I understand him being a black person that likes rock. He's just a 1 of 1. He's not a man's man. But he's a man of his own self because he demands respect. He makes you respect him. Fan , opponents, haters or whatever. I respect this Guy. I really didn't like either but now I like this one . ⭐
He should habe took him to the ground oe subbed him
Man hope he can avenge loss but shot this mma
Not going to lie the way he took that loss made me a fan
Best day ever
Izzy will be back hopefully and become champion again
Even after getting rocked he gets rid of the monster bottle
respect to Isreal, but to say he was fine and would win ....another cleaner shot or two grazed ones, he would go down
Khamzat puts this dude away easy with that powerful wrestling ability he has.
he needed some humble pie
Yk when he first started I hated the guy but after seeing him destroy everyone man I always want him to win go get him again Izzy and take your gold back
Adesa is great athlete, great man with incredible character.  He will get through and become even better
He will get the belt back Mark my words and I would still pick him to beat Alex if they thought again because he whooped his ass for 20 minutes
The only reason this looked like Izzy’s best performance was bc Alex MMA level is just a beginner lmaoo
He will be back
Pmsl he should have thought twice about that outfit 😂 what was he thinking 😆
This dude looks cringe wtf
Adesanya will win the rematch
Alex was the better man of the night
Jon Jones chilling somewhere laughing he's ass off at izzy 🤣
I think no matter where Israel fights if he fights Alex he will always get knock out.
Earlier rounds he was sliding out real well when he got backed up against the cage idk why he let him pin him there
respect
What a loser 3-0 hahahahaha next it’ll be 4-0 , you Israel fans are a joke.
hats off to Alex, heart of a lion...nothin' but love for Izzy...a great champion, he'll be back.
Alex is the True G , Adesanya is obviously very talented, but circling and running was never the brand of badass ufc fighters
Mma fans are weird no respect when he was winning all the respect after the loss I'm old mma fan we are slow to get on hypetrain but ones we on the train we on for life.
Izzy is so humble if the ref didn't stop it he wouldn't be at this conference , he would of went to hospital to get checked  ...
Ok, total respect Israel, but... let's be honest folks... he was not there anymore. If the fight was not stopped, it could have been much worse for him, it could have ended like Usman.
Alex made Izzy look EZ
Damn hope Izzy's okay since comparing he's health situation to Chadwick's 😥
It’s a good thing he lost. He didn’t get seriously injured, and to be frank, I don’t know where this ranks as PPV ratings compared to Izzy other fights, that being said, a Rematch would be HUGH! And I think it’s going to generate a lot of PPV buys for Izzy, let’s face it at 185 he’s the goat and The weight class is looking flat, I didn’t care for this fight, people said that Alex beat him in kick boxing but that means 💩 in MMA.  Izzy was winning very easily but each time Alex touched Izzy, you knew Izzy could be in trouble. This fight has Rejuvenated Izzy and the 185 division. So I’m excited to see Izzy get back his belt. Respect to Alex for a great comeback, he deserves all the praises but I don’t see him holding that belt for long.
Goofy azz didn't use cartoon references huh, that's what u get 4 painting yo nails n misleading the youth
A true champ with a great attitude. 👍
first of all youtube i'm not voting for warnock
Izzy is the best
I told him he should’ve turned into Black Panther and used his vibranium suit.
Love Izzy man win or lose 🙏🏼🙌🏼
He could have finished him in the 3rd he should of put hooks in & tried for a rear naked choke
that jacket is dope a.f.!!
Does anyone know if it is real fur? What kind of animal? Need to know so I know if I can hate him now
I was a hater but even though Izzy lost he still won with the fans. It was just an amazing fight I’ll never forget. Thank you  Adesanya.
Seriously, this guy was a great champ. Took on all top contenders, didn’t duck anyone, didn’t take a vacation, didn’t retire.  One of the most dominate and active Champs ever.
Izzy got that Black Panther vibe ngl
That coat looks ugly and ridiculous I can't lie 😂
John Jones would have Izzy poe ass
im watching this screaming F$CK YALL at the screen! with your dumba$$ questions! Izzy is forever the champ.
Wow izzy!! You are the champion warrior -formerly bob mar
Much respect my man. I didn't like ether to lose man.
Bring back Mazigati!
Damn good post fight conference.
Izzy is a great role model. You can be hard as nails, but also be kind, respectful, intelligent and humble. Can't wait for the next fight!
Young Man you got K.O  jajajaja
Lucky his leg turned off
I’m sooo pissed off he lost I truly wanted him to win face his demons and take over. He looked good out there I felt he was prepared and put his all into it but much respect to Izzy  for being honest with himself and taking this experience and making a new game plan for the rematch
You win some, you lose some. Come back and get that belt Izzy!
People eating up his act of humbleness but everyone knows if he would've won he would've been talking shit I'm glad he finally got whooped
That KO in the first round should have been it. 😊
is that chinchilla?
He looks like Bigfoot with a Izzy head, Izzy will win in points but Alex will win with a KO or more damage
Wish I could’ve seen this guy go to sleep like usman downfall of the African cornballs
Remember watching the match I did not like his looks before the fight begin He looked scared
No that's what happens when you find your match. That's what happens when UFC decides to put you in the cage against a guy who is just as tall as you and was just as good of a striker like you. 3-0, soon to be 4-0 in rematch. You talking bout Sonning Vettori and Whittaker right? Well this dude sonned you, he's officially your daddy.
How many people got knocked out by a left hook last night? 🙋🏼‍♂️
Glad the guy lost, now for Francis to lose.
Left him on skates, frozen, like Elsa-izzy
Izzy has class, he is patient and takes the loss like a champ.  He really was ahead in the fight, not to mention the weight difference. Congratz to Alex also, amazing accomplishment.
Alex is the Wilder of MMA.
Fuck yeah! Alex is King!
compared himself to Chadwick, fk outta here
LOL SALTY, CHANGE UR JACKET, HOPE THATS NOT REAL, TALKTALKTALK!
Izzy would of one when he was Alex back he missed so many submission opportunities he could of easly choked out Alex but I didn't see any submissions confidence
He was risking a knee to the face when he was bent over at the end.  I think it was a great stoppage.
@03:37  Nah mate, you woulda dieded   Also, Mario yamazaki says hello
Sad to see a role model wear fur…
Another reason why Izzy is irritating that ridiculous coat
Not one time has he congratulated his opponent
He was out on his feet.
you lost shut up
Nice fur you little girl
This fight pissed me tf off. Especially cus it looked like izzy was trying his hardest while perreira was just waiting taking shots like if he knew something about later rounds or like he was hunting looking for the right moment
Can’t wait for the rematch
A champ a great and respectful athlete
what does he mean by his chest anyone?
Always got love for Izzy ❤.
I’m really sad for Izzy, I really didn’t like how his main defensive strategy was to get backed down to the fence and try not to get hit. Even so, I’m not sure Izzy can beat him, Perreira might have his number simply because of genetics. Perreira is just as tall with the same range but way bigger and more durable with power that carries to the last round. It’s like Izzy was fighting with a fucking oak tree.
The responses of maturity & humbleness & the retooling of their moral compass, by both Usman & Adesanya, respectively, after both of their championship losses, have blown me away.       I always say, EVERYONE needs to be punched in the face @ least once in a while.....
Cope!
Thats what happens when you talk too much now. Im happy alex knocked the nail paint and pearl of his head.
Izzy is a true champ
Everybody likes to say "you're a casual if you don't appreciate Izzy's style". I have seen thousands of MMA, Boxing, Muay Thai/Kickboxing fights. I've also been trained by some very high-level guys and I have tonnns of sparring time. I'm nothing special not even a professional but I'm immersed enough in this game to have calculated opinions.   I'm glad that you got beat. I think you needed to get beat in order to become more complete. I don't have any problems with your character Izzy but your approach to fights is far from glorious. You were probably talented enough to become the goat but you lacked greatness itself which is the most important measuring factor of GOAT status. You were like Tyron Woodley 2.0; Your run to the title was phenomenal, impressive and exciting but once you got there you became way too complacent. The only positive memorable thing you did as champ was extinguish Paulo Costa the way you did....  You're still in your prime man. I hope this lights a fire under your ass and we get to see the older Izzy climb back to the top with vengeance. I would love nothing more than to see you destroy everybody like we know that you can. Your fight with Kelvin Gastelum is possibly in my top 5 favorite fights of all time. That is saying a lot. Go kick some ass dude
Facts izzy dared to be great he has fought only the top guys of the div and they are usually always bigger then him so can’t respect izzy enough he fought Alex we he didn’t have to be coulda pushed him to the side like Conor did khabib for over 2 years but yo man said bring back Steve mazzigatti lol
Such an Ass...If he didn't speak he would be great but he can't.
It's like the make makachev situation.  You know to stay off the fence but what can you do!?!??
He such a cocky bastard even in defeat he can’t be humbled lol he needs to lose again and run off to another sport like he did with kickboxing
Man Im happy for Alex but gotta feel bad for Izzy, he was doing so good but he kept making 1 mistake, letting Alex back him up against the fence, every single time I saw Izzy getting backed up against the fence I was thinking there comes the KO, and it came
I was calling it all week, I’m so happy that Izzy got finished!!! Hell yeah
Was anybody’s win. If Izzy had another 20secs at the end of round 1 he’d be the winner. Worst thing is trying to beat someone after they’ve recovered from almost being knocked out. As soon as that happened I knew Izzy was gonna lose the fight.
The only good shot izzy landed was after the bell
That jacket is awful
ISRAEL let off the pressure the fourth it’s was over on the fifth matter of time. Alex executed exactly how it went the first time.
Fortune favor the BOLD brother, keep your head back and get that belt back!
Im glad this mf got whooped he swears he some type of samurai warrior get knocked tf out !!
This boy lives in a world of illusions. That's a winner's fur. But he is the loser. A little humility wouldn't hurt after three lessons in a row ...
He needed to get humbled to be great again.
The most active champion in the ufc .he has nothing to be ashamed about..he had alex rocked in the first round .and maybe 10 more secs he would have finished alex ...ifs what's or maybes alex fought well as did izzy. I'll be intertained for weeks watching these fights over and over especially this and the porier fight.
This is what happens when you actually try to fight, Izzy is been dodging opponents and forgets this is a show and a fight nobody’s want to see you running, glad Alex k.o the f out of Izzy , so humble just a little smile, I bet if Izzy won he was going to talk so much shit , Izzy got f ing humbled 😂
Ok so wait, he's happy lost, f everyone, the belt isn't important... Hmmm, idk
... my ego was fine, I was just getting smashed
He is wearing fur😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Whatcha wearing there bud 😂😂😂
What an amazing fight! One of the best MMA fights ever. Big respect to Izzy on how he’s handling the loss and articulation of everything.
If Izzy always fought like this one, swear to Bob I'd be his biggest fan.
Alex has his number like Fury has Wilders
I hate that fur jacket i do hope somone wears him one day! he needs to go watch some anime alone,SLEPT!
Izzy is the Mayweather of MMA. To be a true champion you must be the fighter that moves forward not sit back and only fight when the other fighter is coming forward. A very popular style with fighters today.
Get humble
This ironically will make izzy's stock rise because he lost. Now if he wins the rematch and it goes to a 3rd you might be looking at Conor vs nate levels of anticipation.
Such a good well spoken champ. Good job izzy! Much love homie
Why is he dressed like a gay bigfoot ?
Welcome to wwe matchfixing
I used to dislike Izzy so much that I always rooted for him to lose on every one of his past fights. But this dude has grown on me lately, always talks with grace, with great intellect. Hope to see him get that belt again!
Refuckingspect good fight
Izzy looked masterful in this fight. If anything I’m a bigger fan now than I was before
Early and stupid stoppage.
I'm not an izzy fan at all but it was actually quite refreshing to see him quite humble in this interview. As I say I'm not a fan but he deserves an immediate rematch
Also 0-3 against him he needed  some humbleness lol..
Buddy looks like cruella de vil with that coat
I can’t stand izzy but it’s true he could have ran but he put it on the line
A movie will be made about Alex pereira that shit was legendary !!!
Horror movie backfired on isreal😂
Hadn't the referee early stopped, Izzy would have survived and probably won
How many foxes for your coat??
YOU ARE A LEGEND IZZY!!! Such a close fight and so unlucky for it to end up how it did. You were easily ahead & if that first round went 10 seconds longer Alex would've been done. Can't wait to see you bring it again in the next fight bro!!!
Naw bruv u was out
Izzy is a great champ ! Love U
It just amazed me how tiny alex made izzy look. The way he stalked him the whole time i knew deep down the finish eas inevitable
I'm no expert by any means. But the way he would move with his hands down or extended throughout the fight while against the fence just seemed like he was asking to get KO'd. I understand he does that against lesser strikers all the time but he knew how serious Alex is when it comes to striking. I'd like to hear his reasoning for why him and his team didn't work on having a more traditional boxing style defense for this particular fight.
Been Knocked out Twice  Finished 3 times  Alex is done with you dude
Nice fight from both fighters! Izzy was winning on points, and Alex needed a finish and got one. Both where excellent
Love that jacket tho
Alex will never be as marketable as Izzy.
how many times alex got to beat this guy? best to seven?
You know he keep the same energy
0-3 against Alex
Anybody that can wrestle won’t end well for pereira. Guess Khamzat will be the new champ
Mans looking more and more like StickMan from the App games
Same energy Stoooooooooplast Transbender your gonna Cry.....
AP was out on his feet that round at the end but recovered beautifully. Great strategic fight as well!
Bring back Steve Mazzagatti, that's too funny.
Where is Amanda Nunez?
Arangetang
0-3
His NIGHTMARE caught back up with him
I barely saw Alex throw a leg kick now I seen u flipping all over
He's so classy! I really really like this kid. I thought he hurt himself when he threw a leg kid when he fell down. Now we know it was injured. But he gives him all the credit for investing in the calf kicks. AP looked exhausted and done so great job to him and his team for digging deep and pulling this off. Great fight!!!
Izzy is a pro's pro.
Thanks God that it got stopped bcuz you wouldn't b doing no interview
I really love Izzy's unbelievably powerfully positive attitude. It makes me feel so much better about the loss as a very big fan. This was the best possible words i couldve heard in my current situation as well.
TRYING to keep the same energy😂
This guy can't admit that he got rocked ! Granted he kept his legs under himself but he was clearly not on the attack nor was he defending himself well, due to being lumped up. He rocked Pereira a little & didn't capitalize on the moment.  I think he rocked him harsh but did no follow up & as we all saw, he took some, gave some then got lumped ! Period  !
Israel only lost because the gyno tit was weighing his arm down.
Wat makes people think that MMA n kick boxing is different n the only thing is the BJJ n wrestling part but other than that it's striking n kicking
He was getting lit up like punching bag
Dat compromised leg was d hinderance to evading d last launch of Alex.... Otherwise 3-2
Man I feel like this guy is as real as it gets.
One of his best performances wat? Stop lying to Israel bcuz that's not right
You are a beast. I cant wait to see your next fight
I don't care how many times Izzy has to fight to beat this guy but I tell you today Izzy will finish this guy eventually
Same old story n same results
Shouldn’t be allowed to cut 30 40 pds pereira looks absolutely huge in 185
I was rooting for Alex but Izzy shows champ behavior. Good on him
What a humble dude
Izzy will be back. He has lost before...and he could lose again....but next time....he KNOWS the new champ CANT GRAPPLE ...and the rest of the division knows too....and by rights...they're coming for him.
Legend
Always a CLASS ACT with Adesanya....but he has TWO nasty knockouts with the same guy, he is NOT going to recover from that, at least with Alex....
Still the sharpest knife in the drawer.... love you Izzy.
He didnt put it out, he got put out. Hes a great fighter who got walked down and got caught. He deserves a rematch for being successful for so long but i hope he's more aggressive in next fight Because he had em a couple times but his lack of aggression or him relying on his counter punching cost him the fight.
Love Izzy. Love his post fight demeanor. I've been a fan & respect him even more after this. This rematch is gonna be fire 🔥
Imagine being as insecure as this guy. Having to show off wealth because you can’t handle defeat. This guys a bad actor.
😂😂😂😂
Amazing how a championship loss finally makes me respect Izzy on a whole other level, in a way I wouldn't have if he was just winning fights.
Anyone that thinks it's an early stoppage just started watching MMA
I was rooting for Alex but for some reason I’m sad to see Izzy lose. Great fight. Rematch will be great.
I'm glad how he cut john fat morgan off. That guy never shuts up
Frozen like Elsa.. The Last Icebender!
The coat looks sick ,he's still a legend
This fool said “Bring back Steve Mazzagatti” 😂💀💀
What the fuck is that jacket? Seriously, that is a bigger disaster than the 5th round!
Looks like he skinned an orangutang for that jacket?
Lost 3 times against this guy. Now a rematch for the 4th time he will lose
ISRAEL ASHAMED
Izzy the true champ
I gotta give lots of respect to Izzy and how classy he is after the loss. Come back strong
This guy .. rematch we result the same way bro. No answer for his opponent
Dude still comes off like an arrogant prick
Great champion. Keep your head up Izzy you’ll be back✊🏽
Adesanya was ALWAYS going to be in a LOT of trouble with Pereira; Alex is TALLER and has the same REACH as Adesanya....he doesnt do well in those circunstances...and when he talks about the Prestige of having the BELT; its not about the Belt, its about the PAY that comes with it ! any Champion gets payed a LOT MORE than anybody else to fight any opponent...
Bro Izzy was winging the whole fight like dam he blew it he was really looking good
You guys have you ever played UFC and ended up getting caught the same way by the same guy you know you can beat hands down? It's the same situation here. He knows he can beat him, but he got tripped up at that same point, as Alex started to rise up Israel was starting to ease off the gas to take a breather. That's all that happened. Props to both of them.
'lucid' 😂😭 my dude was literally out on his feet and one shot away from permanent brain damage 🤣. Talking about had the ref let it continue, he woulda won a decision 🤣  cmon now, woulda won a free drive to the hospital in a strecher at best lol, if not coffin to the morgue 💀   Yet people saying he's 'classy and humble in defeat lol, all I hear is excuses
It's that time of the month for Izzys fans. Yall Going defend him in comment sections from normal people like it's going to help him beat Alex 😂 absolutey embarrasing.
He stole someone’s grandmas coat
Izzy now has a perfect understanding of Rob feels.
Alex is gonna get beating by a wrestler easy he has zero ground game I don’t know if he has jujitsu
Even in defeat this man is a champion. Truly inspiring! Thank you Israel!
Bruh come on. UFC set this man up to fail. They found the one guy who has beaten him and it was always the plan to dethrone him.
Took it like a champ.
Crazy to me that Alex literally got the finish at will when he needed to
He can act all he want like he don't care. You trained all your life in a high level sacrificing everything around him to perform. This one hurts him. Nobody trains this hard to loose. Hopefully he bounces back.
Izy was right it was a Horror Movie .
So happy to see this guy loose. Couldn’t happen to be a better person cocky DB.
Seeing the size difference when they first came out was startling. Alex was not that big in this kick boxing fights. Adesanya was clearly the more technical fighter. I'm a tall lanky fighter myself so I'm always cheering for Izzy. To see him implementing such good striking just to basically get out muscled in the end was so sad. Izzy deserves praise for this loss. He didn't just go out there and start away from Alex, he tried to bring the fight to him. He tried to give us the fight we wanted. That Brazilian is fucking scary, I guarantee not one single person criticizing Izzy would have done the same. Even 3-0 against him, I really do think Izzy can beat him. He just has to be perfect. Alex has to get lucky once. That's the game they played.
Dam he just compared his injuries to Chadwick cancer
Remember when women dressed like women and Men didNt dresS like a BITCH
Let's be real. Izzy was worried coming into this he was gonna get ko'd again. Dude is just his boogeyman at this pt. I could tell he was just trying to hype himself up and mask it but that wasn't gonna happen. Although props off to em, he did almost have em out at the buzzer of the first rd. Most exciting Izzy fight in some time and that is mostly due thanks to his opponent.
People thought izzy was going to win because "it's MMA" I'm glad y'all said that, because now we won't ever hear that goofy shit again.
Hes a hella of a fighter and it might have been an early stoppage. It’s a good story for a rematch
I like him more now than I did before his loss. A real Champion.
You were 2 second away from a knee
There is levels to this :)
He was so loopy, that he tried clinching like he was in a boxing match. His ptsd from the 2 previous fights
Beautiful performance by both and respect Alex but this in my option now gives Izzy the edge
He was getting knocked around like a pinball in a machine...and he claims it's an early stoppage. Be a man and own your shit.
Idiot, stupid coat,pearl necklace? Glad he lost.
Wish that people who are blessed with riches would give to the homeless, sick & needy in the world instead of wearing your riches!!! Arrogance is a sin.
Nah, you just wanted to win by points Frosted tips former champ
Izzy deserves a massive of amount of respect. He kept fighting all year and previous. What he said is true. He kept risking his belt and status to entertain the world.. I still think he’s the best fighter in UFC for sure. 1 think about the UFC that keeps proving itself. Your future is never safe, no matter who you are, or how good you are. Anyone in the UFC is capable of ending a champs run.
Izzy can still beat him
No matter what happened I’m really proud of what Izzy did! He did really well in the first 3 rounds really thought he had it but what a fight!
Cocky Izzy got what he deserved😂 he will never beat Alex 💪
Love the coat. Great fight. Even in defeat Izzy is class. As a fan of the sweet science of fighting that was superb. Rematch? Fxxk yes! 🥋🥊
I’m just glad he didn’t get flat lined, like everyone saying early stoppage it would have been too late of a stoppage and would have been worse glad it stopped he’ll be okay I’m glad for his health
I bet the rematch Izzy smokes him!
Mad respect after this fight
No mention of the orangutan coat?
History repeats itself! Andddddd The Newwwwwww Champion: Alex Pereiraaaaa! Representing the indigenous group of people in Brazil. Congrats Champ! Everyone defending Izzy forgot he was disrespectful towards Pereira during the press conference, and during the fight. He kept mocking Pereira.  Izzy Danced in front of Pereira and made gestures that were improper. That´s why he got TKO in the last round.
Everybody saying props to him etc which 100% absolute stand up champ. Nobody is going to comment about how he made a cancer reference? Man I hope izzy is going to be OK. He has actually looked oddly in pain this past week
What a champ!great attitude!
What’s going on XXX pt1…Vin Diesel his idol 🤣😂😎
If that first round was just a little longer Izzy probably would have won but Pereiras recovery is scary almost Wolverine like !!!
Rejects a coke brand , gets another coke brand in lol 😂
Habib is the GOAT
I’m so glad this fight happened. Alex is definitely The final boss in Izzy’s ark, the rematch is going to be intense
That better be fake fur if it's not he got knocked out from karma
Hmmm. Pink nails, pearl necklace, boobies. Maybe in the background he's battling what to identify as. It's all good Izzy you do you.
If it turns out Izzy was battling some form of cancer, ya’ll gonna feel like assholes for making fun of his chest.
That fur is fkin uglyyy!!!!
Izzy is a true champion.
Like showbizz said he gonna cry in the car 😂
Big respect for izzy here
His arrogance and playing around cost him his title. Be humble or get humbled. Come back stronger and more focused and stop the nonsense in the ring.
Is it easy to remember these journalists names or this guy just happens to be attentive much...because each time a new person asks a question,  he calls them by name🤔
Still the people's champ. Kuddos to Alex for an amazing fight after getting clipped at the end of the first. This dude is scary
W Responses shouts out to izzy
he can't beat Alex
What a way to lose,
Izzy the legend
he don't say no to fights unlike others out there
He is great,there’s no doubt that said he got to cocky he will win next time cuz he will be more humble,again he’s a great champ hands down one of the best EVER #humbled
Pereira is a monster!!
I always wondered how aware he was of people talking about his supposed gyno…
This guy puts it al on the line , he ducks no one and makes no excuses
Izzy was playing with him then got clipped
This sucks
He needs to be humbled again, maybe he will stop to wear that kind of coat :)
I hope he makes a comeback and avenges this loss.
Nearly finished it in the first round and was winning on everybody's score card. Was a really close fight, but all respect to Pereira. Great fight
Respect to Izzy for how he handled this. Grace for days.
Confidence? Top level.
Huge Israel fan! I thought it was a great fight! Had him up 3 to 1 going into the 5th. I thought he could have pressured more in the 4th and stayed away from the cage in the 5th, but I didn't realize the leg damage. I loved the Jigsaw theme walkout! That was awesome! Huge respect to Izzy and how he handles this loss. Awesome answers in the post fight and loved the tweets he made after the fight (And the hashtag he added - #nowondertheymadesomanysawmovies haha!). He was a great champion, definitely deserves a rematch, but hopefully he gets a bit of a break before that happens. He's super active and never turns down a challenge, always goes after the toughest, and is super respectful. Everything you'd expect from a great champion and I hope he gets that belt back soon.
Love u Izzy!
GOAT, you’re a warrior Izzy, thanks for the legendary moments, you ain’t done achieving greatness
what a fight, and wow Izzy is one of the goats
He's putting on a great fissod here but man he's gonna have some tough quiet nights ahead of him.. Hopefully he comes back stronger after this but it's gonna be a tough Bridge to cross
Respect to Izzy, cutting off the rest of John Morgan’s questions😂 Legend
this stoppage may have prolonged his career. we have to wait and see.
Stand up, Izzy. Recover well and come back.
izzy was fighting great just like kamaru but this is the fight game it is what it is love this sport
He finally got humbled.
Alex a lion.
Much respect to Israel Adesanya. I was hateful towards him and I regret that. I respect that he has increased mental health awareness and that he stood up for Joe Rogan. I like that he’s always positive, especially after a loss. He is a real champion and my apologies go out to him, from the bottom of my heart. I’m also concerned for his health as he alluded to not disclosing everything to the general public and it is very possible he is fighting one or Another diseases while fighting in the UFC, which makes him an even greater champion 😢❤️🙏🏻 much love to you Israel Adesanya.
Love Izzy man
He had that fight too. Just needed to survive 3 more minutes. But godamn Pierera is such a beast.  This fight needs an immediate rematch that was fun to watch.
That guy will only be stopped by Izzy... He is going to kill other guys.. He got away with it again..
What a liar!!! He said he was fine!? Shit
Alex Is the pettiest man in the world, glory wasn’t enough he wanted Izzy in his highlight reel in the UFC too 🤣🤣🤣. 3-0
https://youtu.be/8oexrdavyrQ
Izzy's my favorite fighter. Very humble and see's learning opportunities in defeat.
Respect to Izzy for being a fighting Champion He should Teach Francis to stay a fighting champion
I honestly people don’t care for Alex I think most hate Izzy that much. Alex lose the belt people won’t care.
Is that Chewbacca’s fir?
Went full American 🇺🇸 hasn’t he 😂🤡
He's so mad though 😂
Might be an unpopular opinion but I think because he’s 0-3 against Alex in combat sports he doesn’t deserve an immediate rematch
He'll be back. I thought Alex won rounds 1 & 2 . Am I the only one? Izzy caught Alex at the end of 1 but but Alex out struck him & hurt him a few times  . Idk I'm not a fighter fan I'm a fight fan. This sets up another great fight. Could bring back that hungry Izzy. The fans won
Had my bets on Alex but kinda wanted Israel to win gotta be honest
is that fox?   Great renewable resource..   Fur forever.  Support your trappers.
He had a chance for win when he was on the back of perera by submission but he didn't i dunno why as a fan I'm miserable now
Is he wearing a orangutan ferr
Alex is one of the great Champz in the UFC history 👏 👍 👌
He frozen like elsa
Izzy you are a great champion!
Izzy tried to end it with a left hook and gets left hooked once again
Izzy and Alex are the Colby and Usman of the middle weight division.   Alex and Izzy fought very similarly, last night. But just like the Coby and Usman fights, the fighter that has the edge in power apparently wins.    Alex 3-0 over Izzy Usman 2-0 over Colby
Israel "the last wookie" Adesanya
I can’t love this guy enough <3.
He got caught he will NEVER beat Alex. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  You LOST, punk.   You weren't even looking while Alex was teeing off on your ass.  You got WHOOPED!  Your team couldn't help you Your skills couldn't help you And next time, he will beat your ass AGAIN.   Izzy - 🙄🤓   😂😂😂 😂😂😂  You will NEVER beat Alex, CHUMP!  3-0 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
and hes wearing a god dam Karella Deville 101 Dalmations coat . Later bra
Don't compare this fight with the Usman fight. Usman was bullying Leon Edwards...
Props...all class here.
Two seconds from a first round K.O.  That’s how crazy this sport is
Let me tell all this haters about Bone Jones 😏 😌 🤪 Jon will beat both of them n take the belt 🤣 👍 👌 real talk..
Bro this world is so ugly humans are despicable. All this hate. I’m no fan of Alex but congrats to him, obviously Izzy is way more skilled. Alex just got power. That’s it. (Incoming hating low lifes thankful Izzy loss and not acknowledging how is is actually better than this guy.
This is how a champion should represent himself win, lose or draw. Definition of professional.  I have no doubt he'll be back better than ever.  At first I didn't like the stoppage, but after rewatching the fight again I'm glad the fight was stopped. Live to fight another day.
Heres a bottle of tap water ( Aquafina)
He has medical stuff going on it’s called steroids now he gonna try and make you feel bad I wasn’t talking like that about Jones keep that same energy
Man when he tripped I thought he pulled a sliva smh
I'm proud of you izzy... I was rooting for you... My heart broke seeing you in that moment however you fought a good fight bro... You almost took him out man... It just one those days but you will get him back you deserve a rematch.. Khumo from SA..Much Love...
Uce you think the ref stop the fight little to early?? 🤣
Him getting rid of that monster gets me every time 😂
Dumb ass jacket  Too notch fighter
I'm proud of you izzy... I was rooting for you... My heart broke seeing you in that moment however you fought a good fight bro... You almost took him out man... It just one those days but you will get him back you deserve a rematch.. Khumo from SA..Much Love...
"My leg happened"? No bro your head getting bopped around into a tko happened...
yall saying he humble and can take a loss, but yall mustve forgotten he trashed Alex on his alcoholic addiction by sayin : 'he'll be a drunk guy in a bar sayign he ko'd me once' (now it's twice). that's low given alex efforts raising awareness and helping ppl being through the same, because Im brazilian and he touches on that a lot in his interviews. he been humbled yeah.
Pure class.
I want a rematch
The wrestling was hard to watch.
Izzy is still the champ in my eyes.   Alex still needs to earn it. Cant wait to see Alex vs bobby knuckles
Izzy got robbed that stoppage is the baddest stoppage i ever seen!!!!
Alex. Made him humble.. Glade the new champion isn't covered in perls, nail polish!
That’s the way to take a loss. Respect.
He's too big for you or some?? 🤣 🤣 great fight Champ come back hard 💪 I was vote for the Brazilian 🤣 real talk..
What is that Arangutan
Sad that it takes a loss for everyone to be respectful to izzy, hes been a legend from day one
Pearls and a old woman’s coat, you start looking like a transgender… what the hell is going on dude
i'm a long time casual. i was an adensanya fan until he started painting his nails. rip style bender. it was fun.
Love the lady speaking maori kia ora girl
Izzy haters are the most cringe ass people. Imagine hating someone who's that good, extremely active, never ducks anyone, always makes weight, doesn't fights dirty, is never a sore loser, and is super loyal to his team just because he's confident in painting his fingernails lmfao
He gonna cry when he gets in car
Yeti fur coat? WTF?
True champ even in defeat.. king vibes👊🏾✊🏽
Huge respect to both fighters for going out there and battling at a high level not many people will do that,  both of these guys don’t need a belt to be called champions they’re already champions in life! 4L!
Love you Izzy✊🏾
He swears,  he disrespects animals.  Poor example
Hey man, it is what it is. We all take that loss. Good job as champion and much respect!
He looked crazy sharp, almost toying with Alex in the 4th round. I think he got a little bit overconfident and lost focus, because it was going so well for him. Alex is just an absolute monster though, eating everything and hitting back twice as hard.
Damn i got so much more respect for izzy after this fight and how he handled himself after.
Bragging when u when oh it don’t matter when you lose lol fukk outta here! He was out on his feet ref should of let him get slept lol
What a guy, takes the loss without excuse.  He had the fight, but congrats to Alex for finding a way after being down so far.  I feel like Izzy will figure out how to avoid getting pinned on the fence, and will win the rematch.  He will probably wrestle more and drain him.
Great job Izzy.  I like seeing the love and support in the comments for you.  It's honestly refreshing.  You guys put your lives on the line and we respect that.   Don't listen to these fake keyboard warriors!
So basically Khamzat Chimaev is our new Middleweight Champion of the world.
wow did this guy just compare himself to Chadwick Boseman having cancer? Unless this guy has a similar issue, that is VERY insulting and a slap in the face to all cancer patients
I thought that was bigfoot in the thumbnail
Izzy isn’t my favorite fighter but I respect him. I don’t respect his sh*t talking, bandwagon fans though. They are eating crow right now but by tomorrow they will be switching to another fighter to bandwagon on.
Great champion.
HEAVY RESPECT
Izzy is the man, such a pro on every level. Cant wait for the rematch and getting his belt back, Izzy had that fight but shit happens. Lets go CKB 🤙
What the FUCK IS HE WEARING. He fooorsure got KO'd
Man, crazy thing that we've seen twice now fighters losing so dominant to win in the last round
I really dislike how all he hypocrites are now giving respect to Izzy when ya’ll were massively talking shit to him all week. Mma fans are a joke
Lion outfit you were slaughtered by a Cow! lol
I was rooting for him and even like him better after the lost. Never liked him before
This fight was beautiful ❤
Is crazy how all the great combat fighters got defeated this year like Usman , canelo , and now Israel adesanya .
Delusional till the end. Respect.
"That Hook" landed after the bell.
Luv you Izzy!!
its sad the language these guys gotta use while being interviewed , they should carry themselves better like the greats before them . This would not be accepted back when people had morals .
A class act
Izzy is definitely more than capable of winning the next fight..
What a champion  you have been Izzy 🏆 🥇  What a legend Much love and respect to I-diss-on-ya all the way from South Africa We are proud of you Oga 👏
I love izzy for putting it on the line unlike some who run away
Its going to be 4-0 if he fights again. So far Izzy has been fighting midgets. Alex is too much for him. He will never beat Alex no matter how many times he tries.
Dude doesn't look like he was in a fight. Put cornor in the same scenerio. 😂😂 congrats to both AP and Izzy
Lol bro took a fat L
Sheesh Alex has his # !  Edit: respect to how he handles losses
Man i can't lie i feel the pain of this loss
Ok, I guess I’ll pretend like izzy grew a tit from some mysterious health problems he’s keeping secret and it wasn’t from taking steroids.
I don’t see how anyone is so surprised
good job in taking the loss gracefully honourably, pereira deserves this belt...took shots and kept coming forward patient waiting for that TKO
Got to give it to Izzy.  Humbled but still POSITIVE.  Congrats to both Izzy and Alex. ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTS IN MMA. Thanks UFC for great fights.
Ref did well he would have killed u bro what are  u talking about
Stop giving excuses!!! You faced the right opponent and full stop!
Class act! True professional
Humble champion  had an amazing run
What is the issue with his chest he mentioned?
Fuck is he wearing 🤡
Isreal is not humble at all, get knocked out cold and still putting on an act... next time dont let the ref step in and we shall see his answer at the end... this dude is something else, no wonder why Paulo wanted to merk this guy
Man is boring AF and he's the head movement of rhino lol he so slow and needs to learn hot to box lmao, he go hit all the few punches the got thrown at him
Only the casuals picked izzy
He was not fine ,  straight out on his feet getting tagged over and over
I still love you Izzy !!! You’re a hero !!!
Izzy’s loss is what truly reveals him as a true champion and competitor. He’s beyond gracious and honest in defeat, and that will allow him to learn what he needs to from the situation and bounce back better and stronger than before.
Izzy will be back
"Win, Lose or Draw i come out with the same energy." (first of coming_Trilogy goes to Alex) predict Izzie wins the next two.
Not gonna lie,  IZZY earned my respect with his acceptance and the way he carried defeat.  That was real Gangster 😳
I never really liked izzy in the past. Leading up to this fight tho I gained so much respect for Izzy. This fight was scary as hell for him and he caught a lot of heat. Borderline bullying from the community. Dc only showing highlights of him getting rocked on tv. Man. He dominated that fight. Nothing to be ashamed of but much much respect for Izzy now. I am officially a fan.
Lazy you lost because you were too cocky if you stayed humble, you’re not lost, but you’re too cocky nothing personal against you 🤡
This is why I'm starting to preferring the UFC. The best fight the best and quickly. The under cards are great and generally I don't see corruption. UFC fighters are warriors.
Izzy one of a kind, takes the loss like a champ, he will be back
Fuck that Rematch❗️❗️❗️
I’m glad adesanya lost. His cockiness irritated me. He needed his huge ego bringing down a peg or two. So watching pereira Knock  the shit out of him at the end of that felt quite satisfying. Because pereira seems humble, not a cocky dickhead. But I will give adesanya his dues, he took the loss well, is a fantastic athlete and competitor, and a good guy overall, but I think he needed this, just to help him as a human being
Umm Jan? Or  you mean like almost being ko'd by the same guy again Jesus.
yeah he was playing with his food and I loved the fight he wasn't being cocky but wanted to showoff after losing twice to the other man it was really good
Diamonds pearls and fur coat , is this Nancy Pelosi?
Get your nan too  wooly nit a natural  cardigan on that  organ ewe tan ewe are Dan best man
He was moving straight back no no back on the cage no no = ko
Fuck everybody? no fuck you .
Izzy usually fights for points running to win,  not against Alex
This fool is delusional. Put it all on the line?  Fool it’s your job to fight next guy up
The leg had nothing to do with him punching you into a standing KO ffs , this guy talks so much 💩 Comparing himself to Chadwick, that's a dickhead move
Man this hurts, Izzy you were a great champion. A inspiration to me ❤
Is that jacket made of orangutans?
So glad he lost.  He was way overdue.   I'm so happy there's a New Champ!!
Fucking big brawler.
Alex goes down next time.
I rooted for Alex, weird to see a different champion though. I'll say this, he won't be champ long, ground game is weak, you really think the others will stand and bang? Nope
Took his lost like a man I respect that.
Hahaha I am so happy Alex won.
He did have him in the first he is right and he pieced him up. I had Izzy winning every round then he got caught and I thought the stoppage was good
Well done champ 💪🏾✊🏽
Good stoppage I’m not a Izzy fan and even I didn’t wanna see him take more damage
I’m no fair weather fan. I’m ride or die on stylebender express
Izzie doesn't answer to any of us.  It'll mean twice the gate for the rematch.  Izzie ain't going anywhere.
Should’ve just kept it humble and not got those nails
I think what’s happening is these black champions like usman and adesanya are losing on purpose because they’re scared of khamzat, khamzat is aiming at them
In my opinion it was Izzy just trying to get through the 5th round that cost him here. He stopped mounting the offense that was holding Pereira back earlier and just let him walk him down without resistance.
The ref called Alex off WAY too early, Adesanya was still evading and trying to get away from the cage
He wins if they fight again. Honestly, I think Whitttaker beats Alex.
Adesanya fan boys talking how graceful he is in defeat..how about when he won he wasn't so graceful then was he..obnoxious cross dresser...he deserves the spanking that he got...He's humble only when he's humbled ...can't keep his mouth shut otherwise
Great Champ!
Izzy have the charisma of a full diaper.
Should I have a wank or should I just try get my head down without one?
Always the professional, you have to love what this man brings to the sport
He's a sore loser saying he was still okay.. he would have gotten a knee to the face 😅
I just F’ing hate this arrogant douche.
When Alex won, he screamed that he hates that motherf-----! loud and clear   he also refused to shake hands with him to congratulate him like other fighters izzy is butt hurt about this loss and if you dont think so, your an idiot
Pereira just has his number...
Loosing gracefully, puttn' on a brave face' encouraging words........beyond' all dat poker face' Loosing to him Again' -a UFC Title no less'  dats gotta b hurtn' him fm inside like never b4,  Periera Has his Number' ..diff country diff title diff combat sport diff approach Bt da Result is da same' .....i fear izzy wl nevr b da same again'   The most devastating strike to izzy delivered 2d by Periera may well have been to the SPIRIT' not js his legs & body....
He had his time to shine made millions ...It ain't that bad
Losing with class is an artform. Respect to Izzy.
Izzy looking like he's about to defend the wall against some white walkers
Alex has a cinder block for a head and hands
Honor in defeat, great performance from both of you
Win or loss he’s got good energy. Rematch
mark not so goodard strikes again
Bully got bullied by the OG
So happy to see the cringe king get his lol Russ Wilson rolls his eyes at this corn ball
So sad black crow😜
You weren't still there bro you were just about to get reset. But good on you for handling it like a champ 👏
Adesanya is still king 👑
Respect Izzy.
Only saw the crappy after footage but was wondering why he get putting his back to the cage. Makes sense that his calf was done.
Gynosanya kept saying everyone in 185 was his son..Who's your daddy now ?? HA HA HA 😂 🤣 😆 3-0
Great match alex izzy.....rematch???
Head up high champ, youre one of the GOAT’s and a soon to be hall of famer. Glad you got that same energy, stay blessed and cant wait to see you back!
To both fighters and their families and fans, the truth that matters ,is the truth from God! God has blessed  each of you with health many dream of, take your discipline and health and skills, and remember  with all your hearts minds and souls, and read the truth from God! Repent with urgency,  and stay focused that God is truth and from God comes life! True blessing from the heart of God to your heart is what really matters! While the nation claim laws of their lands are laws, the laws from God are truth! Read Genesis  1:1...in the beginning God created heaven and earth! The first verse of the holy bible! ...while win or lose those who love you , are a blessing from God! Keep your head and heart humble! And make a true difference  in your own lives and the lives of those you love! While money and fame has been what your have received  through combat sports, peace and honor has been displayed in some ways, yet truth is no human should be cheered for violence against another! So give your hearts to God and take the time to worship and praise God and see the truth of the times! The Jews are prepared to raise the 3rd temple, their nation was restored after world war 2, muslims continue their submission  to God, and christians  have their interpretation,  soon when the true God reveals his truth to all nations  , all individuals  and families should be in worship and praise and repentance of heart ! Thats the real thing a man does for his self dignity,  family, neighbors,  and culture! ....seek God find him, repent to him and learn and obey the laws from God! With your health! And discipline you ufc fighters,  boxers, wrestling,  and all sports athletes  can achieve much greater things through giving your hearts and minds to God! Amen!...and fans of these athletes truth is the athletes put the work in, so as fans if you truly care about each of these individuals  and writered you also would repent to God! Stop temptation of fame and fortune, let God increase and pride and fame and sins decrease ! Rome, greece, babylon  the great, woman and all the temptation  that comes on the nights of world sports, then a speech is given and the world claps and reads results,  you are involved with temptation  of these individuals  whom see approval or fame and fortune, the true treasure in life is to give God all the glory , to truly love God and to be truly loved by God! To know truth about the laws from God! Many entertainment stars from actors, musicians,  and sports stars survive with the fame and fortune and temptation  the world brings to these events, repent and return to joy in worship! Learn the truth from men like rabbi tovia singer and rabbi friedman! ...dont seek the famous preachers who also want fame and fortune through ( prosperity  gospel preaching) but repent and obey God! Humble yourself to God today and forever),...what does it profit a man to gain the whole world ,only to lose his own souls? Its easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God! .. while many prostitute their hearts, and minds and bodies for fame and temptation,  whom supports and cheers and make a living telling the news to the world? News teams and sports casting,  you have also become rich and famous and claim to your rewards, repent and use your talents to repent and to teach the world the truth! ...the jews will be raising the 3rd temple! The Christians  claim antichrist is alive on earth,  news teams could read the hebrew / english  truth of what the Jewish  nation interpretation  is of when their Messiah  will be on earth, and help the Christians understand their truth spoke. From whom they worship! While the news teams can also explain the truth of what the Christians believe  their Messiah has done to merit their truth! While, the news teams can tall all law makers to place God and his holy commandments  above their own laws! And to stop allowing satan to have churches  and protection  to cause more confusion  and doubt! Stop the tv series lucifer, and evil movies and repent ! Prepare the earth to be returned to God! Repent and earn the love God will give to those who fear and love him! Amen!
What the hell is he wearing? What a flog.
Hopefully, he can humble himself
The more and more I see izzy talk and how humble he is in lose and other stressful and tall orders he deals with I respect the Sh!T out of him.  He's a good guy
So hard to regain confidence against that guy who beat you 3 times
Definitely one of the greatest middle weight fights ever Israel never fails to impress we all look forward to his next fight👏
Geaceful in defeat graceful in defeat bla bla. AND NEW!!!! Not a single ufc fighter save Glover and Tripple C picked him to him. Let's put some respect finslly on Alex's name pls
That coat when you half shut your eyes looks like Izzy bathed in flames. Cool guy who shall return.....
Be honest! You are embarrassed  3-0 and didn't even have the guts to stay in the ring until his arm was lifted up ! What a 🤡💯 chump aside 🤫 LG Alex💯💯💯
Jared Cannonier will give Perreira a good fight
Everyone said izzy would win but i said Alex❤️
U lost 3rd time u don't need another match. Ha.
hahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaha
Izzy is a beast and the best of his generation, win some you lose some but the way he handles both victory and defeat is incredible, This guy is the fucking man.
No rematch you are keep losing to that guy 3 times already 😂
Izzy telling stories out here, he was getting put out cold. Goddard saved him.
Adesanya did risk it this time. He usually doesn’t. I’m a bigger fan now than if he would’ve stayed at range and outpointed him with leg kicks.
No excuses like it even so he is the GOAT  more wins than SILVA
I know he hurt asf on the inside lol
Woah... What did the monster water do to this guy🙄
Izzy wearing a Sasquatch hide! Impressive
Izzy cool but that coat tho🤣🤣🤣🍻
Cringe!
He should have been at least dropped to stop fight. I know he would have been pummeled but he said he was kinda ok. Meatball ball got destroyed for 3 mins in the Crucifix and tapped after being subbed after lady got tired of beating her face. When I saw Herb wasn't doing the main I knew it was going to be somehow integrated into the result.
“You know me I keep the same energy”  LMFAOO this guy was so quiet leading up to the fight. Now he lost and is all energized and acting like nothing happened lmao.
Another lucky champ like Leon in the 5th. Got dominated the whole damn fight and caught him with a lucky left hook
Just flossing an orangutan fur jacket after taking the L 😂
Did you froze him like you said?
TLDW: I couldn’t pull counter him because he’s not shorter than I am like the rest of the 185 division😢
Great energy..   he will come back better
haha greatful sound slike usman pretending losing dont matter.  He couldnt even hardly stand up his hands were dangling at his sid his head was down the fence was holding him up.
No matter who you are it is going to affect you mentally that there's one guy out there who has my number... one guy I simply can't beat, and you know Izzy will be battling demons
cool on the surface but i know he is hurt behind this loss. the rematch will be epic
He was a fool, or tryed to prove something to himself standing ok N the 5th round. He was doing fine untill round 5, when he could have been smarter and take Pereira to the ground. His fight IQ was poor on the 5th round ... A shame
This dude can't admit.... He just got beat...he hot whooped.... And it shows...all them guys were afraid to throw hands with Izzy.... But I always said Izzy is a bish... Anybody throws hand with him..and he would chump up like he did everytime he got a giant the fence.....blame the ref... Wahhhhh the ref saved your dumbass from permanent brain damage.... And they make fun of your chest, because of steroids..... Get this fake dude out of here ...
that coat is amazing
You just know that he would have been talking mad shit if the fight went the distance. Gynobender got humbled tonight and thats that.
Izzy would have beat Alex in round one if there was 50 seconds longer in that round what if always but wow wow wow
Idk the lady who asked questions after John but props to her way to ask good questions without wording it negatively
Crazy year for the championship upsets!!
Izzy i feel is so much of a better fighter than Alex, but unfortunately that doesn’t matter because all it takes is one clean shot and it’s gonna be done and that’s what we saw last night
First Holloway, than usman, then Charles, and now Izzy….. my heart can’t take this anymore
He was unlucky. Should have stayed away from Pereira in last round.
My 3rd fight in 10 months
Give the 2nd round another 5 seconds and Alex would have been knocked out before Izzy did 🤷🏻‍♂️
Happy tonight.
One of the greatest fighters of all time, sometimes people just have your number, doesn’t mean they’re a better fighter, just better against you.
Great interview shows his true growth
Joke of the year -  Izzy saying 'I'm dangerous on the ground'  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is Izzy transitioning?  dude gets gayer and gayer
"I was still there" Izzy was unable to defend himself therefore the ref had to do it for him. his body was there, Izzy was not.
ISRAEL ADESANYA IS A TRUE UFC LEGEND
can't stand this guy, corniest man in the UFC, the guy wouldn't know what style was if it walked up an slapped him in the face.
I like this guy💯
Big respect to Izzy but the stoppage was correct
He defo us a fighting champ Ufc fighters shkd be fighting 3 times a year or like Holland 7 lol
He's a true champion and classy to boot
“I was fine” STFU
Great main card he looked great Alex looked great obv he'll get rematch hopefully win just to get the trilogy as onky Alex has troubled him n he's lapped division. 4 matches n title fight obv rematch in Clause 💯
He might of throw the fight
Great champion can’t wait to the rematch
He don't risk shit he play it safe always never goes for the ko
Israel you fought a good fight, but you need stay from the fence and work on your ground/take down seek Usman or Ngannou’s team prep wrestling jiujitsu. Better version Champ Izzy 2.0
that bit about the ref is the only thing Izzy has to work at. Izzy was unable to defend himself it doesn't matter if he "could see" what was going on. it's an excuse. Alex had Izzy out on his feet and his hands were down
Isn't the UFC tired of rematch?
Alex teaching his son Izzy life lessons again.
Izzy said his coaches and his manager said it was a good stoppage. Enough said. Shout to Izzy. Legend. Best middle weight ever. He’ll be back.
Izzy isn't  surprised that he got beat lol
no you were not fine he saved your from atomic knee
He had alex rocked in the 4th saved by yhe bell problem is izzy needs to go for the kill koed while trying to win on points
Was keen to do a million press interviews before the fight, to me it seemed he was distracting himself from what was to come.
Ladies and gents, THIS IS THE FIGHT GAME!! It’s unpredictable.
Mann Every one knows "No one's gonna accomplish Whaa you've accomplished In The UFC between The whole of Tasman SeaS From Australia To NZ💯❤️🥊
Respect to Izzy in defeat.  He's not running from this defeat and he's correct he's been very active.  He doesn't grab the belt and duck and hide like the other two "African kings" 🙄
Stop giving g opponents opportunities by not giving it your all and trying to finish him.. you ran away in that round because you had won the other rounds..
man poatan is a beast. right up until the last minute he can ko you. trying to eek out a decision vs him is dangerous af. i think when dominant champs like izzy lose, they should take some time off to fully assess things. jumping into an immediate rematch almost never works
Humble pie. You weren’t fine btw Alex would have killed u if it went a little longer the ref did u a favour
Love Izzy - takes balls to do what he did. GSP did the same (except of course he won both fights.) But Izzy fought a brilliant fight until the end.
Kudos!!/Izzy, gracious in defeat. A bonafide  price fighter .. Maybe u run it again.
He should stay humble. He's pissed but covering up.
If that first round lasted another 10 seconds it was over. Kudos to Alex for pacing himself.
Izzy put him on skates, but Alex left him Frozen like Elsa!
Stomped dog shit out this girl
Izzy will return and next time he’s gonna take that guys soul.
It looks like he skinned the Honey Monster and made a jacket from the hide...
This mofo is wearing an anteater …
The way Dustin hit Conor, once your leg is  hurt where it makes it difficult to move you  become a sitting target. Without those leg  kicks Conor sleeps Dustin in that rematch they had
Izzybeth is too womanly that's why he never will be Champion again
that was smartly explained by kim
is he hinting that hes trans?
Izzy got all the Grizzlies really jealous right now….. 😂😂😂😂. Grizzly Adesanya
Why new Zealand people re arrange vowels? LOL Being English it's weirs to listen to. They say ''Igg'' for ''Egg'' and ''DICK'' for 'deck''  LOL
Must be so hot wearing that fur coat after the fight.
Cringe Lord
Much respect Israel. You are a true champ and one of the best to ever laced them up.  Both fighters stuck to their fight plans except for the ref. Adesanya was to inflict damage or a KO in the early rounds. Pereira to weather the early onslaught and look for a KO in the latter rounds.  I feel strongly that Adesanya was robbed of a victory. He fought his fight. Hurt Alex early only for the ref to stop his momentum. Pereira fought his fight and took out the champ just like us casuals predicted, the short left hook.
Respect for Izzy. He has done so much to get where he is. The way he acknowledges his loss is extraordinary interpersonal talent. There will be setbacks in life, for sure. Cant wait to see him fight again. Lets go champ!
Gracious in defeat!!! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Elizabeth is too feminine this Sports is for manly men not womanly man
No excuses. True champion. He dominated the fight, he’ll be back
He will bounce back
Expensive bracelet. Can’t get it wet or the wood inserts will warp. little fact
Girlfriend looks good in her fur coat. Enjoy your vacation smartass. I said Alex Pereira would knock him out again and he did. Lol
Actually found myself loving Izzy a lot more in defeat.
Not a fan of izzy but hey everyone takes an L he'll be back and have respect for him
Early stoppage. When Charles Oliveira fought Michael Chandler, he was hurt just as bad as Izzy was here, but Charles came back to win. Izzy was still standing and moving. He was not out of it. To beat the champ, you gotta finish the champ. Horrible officiating, but Izzy handled it well.
Bottom line is, He his not as good has he thinks he his.
Told my homies he’d get caught on the cage it was the only way he’d lose. And well what happened… instant rematch Izzy wins.
The punch that did the most damage for Izzy was after the bell
Is he wearing orangutan?
Izzy hit Alex with his best shots and the dude kept walking forward. Not sure if Izzy can beat this dude.
I didn't like seeing him lose but he won most of that fight.
I like him, still swagged out.and confident.  Very straightforward and explicit.  Admitted his mistakes and gave credit to Alex on how he was attacking him.   He's a cool brotha!
Why Izzy wearing his winners outfit
All humble now... arrogant POS
"I keep the same energy" Idk why ppl r so blind it's so obvious he cares way to much what ppl think of him. He tries so hard to play it cool. He's the walking embodiment of insecure
IZzy is better but alex always wins because of Allah....if i where izzy i would convert to islam !! ....
No capping, the guy is legendary.  Nuff respect. 🤜 TWALE boss.
Alex had him trapped like costa had him a couple times but kept throwing body kicks instead of letting his hands go. Alex had much better trapping skills on the fence and has that punch in that left hand that can change the entire fight
Jon jones is somewhere smiling 🫣
MF looking like Chewbacca
This idiot lost again?
You supposed not to take that fight and wait till he passes Whittaker and some other warriors  which I don’t think he’ll pass!  So to me wasn’t just a fight it was a champion night.  Izzy my man that was clearly your fault!  I’m really sorry for the whole division.
He took 2 Ls tonight wearing that coat
After his defeat he asceded into SS4 rdy to go for another round my man
when you media trained , this is how a Sour loser sound like !  fk U izzy , this was coming to you cringe fuck
real fur!
It seems to me he is not rehydrating well . . ,something is off with him. Such a Champ mentality . Respect 👍🏼👍🏼
Izzy is a class act. I’m proud to say I’m a fan of this man. He’ll be back
Why are you wearing your moms coat and jewelry?
That’s a sad lion 😢
Great champion and great interview. I got your back Stylebender!!!
The interesting thing is Izzy was winning 3-1, or maybe even 4-0, then the 5th round starts. The commentators said  "now Alex knows he doesnt have to fight another round", and then he proceeds to empty the tank. You cant say Izzy didnt see that coming.
I won good money betting on Pereira. However, I’m not going to lie Izzy did much better than I thought he would. He had me stressing, he is also a great fighter. Pereira is just a monster.
Israel adesanta was winning the fight. But made very small error and paid big price for it. But I have to say Israel is better fighter but parietal has better luck.
Humbled
Don't hit up this guy again, it's fooking 3times, you can't means you can't 🤦‍♂️
6:40, Izzy is not dangerous on the ground lol. Round 3 was like watching two JV guys to at on the mat. Alex was lost. Izzy landed some ground and pound, but didn't capitalize relative to what basically anyone else would do
Got the kurama fur on.
Izzy came in to mix it up but he was not successful at that because Piera was obviously ready for that. Every time they clinched , I feel Piera got a better end of the exchanges . All those liver punches and knees in the clinch adds up at the end. The rule of thumb is never clinch with a bigger man but Izzy had no choice but to clinch. He would have gotten knocked out every time the distance was closed.
Drop the dopey coat, you goof...tryin way too hard.
He needs new boxing coaches!!! I hate that he always has his hands down... having your hands down cost you!!!
If Izzy doesn't win the rematch, he should beat anybody that beats Alex. Can't see Alex defending the belt very long with zero ground game
Izzy is dog water
I really hope that isn't real fur
Good fight both fighters did good but it’s not over till it’s over a rematch should be just as good.
Ur ass have been kicked that the bottom line
Just like his welterweight compatriot, these 2 Nigerians had become far too big for their breeches! It literally hammers home the overused adage that pride does come before a fall: Silva's in-cage antics against Weidman, Usman's not-so-subtle mockery & belittling of Edwards and Adesanya's brazen dismissiveness of Poatan, even calling him the same derisive name as Costa! Well, they all needed to be humbled and they were all forced to swallow a good chunk of that pie 👍 I really hope Edwards and Pereira don't follow the same conceited pattern.
Jones vs alex, lets go!!!!! 👁️
I don’t like Izzy but he deserves a rematch. He fought everyone that the UFC asked him to and he didn’t kill time like other mofos do and hood the belt hostage. None the less Alex needs to work on his wrestling BC the wolf will pick him up and drag him down.
"I could see everything" while he was looking at the ground, hands limp and getting bombs drilled threw his skull.  Okay Elsa, we believe you.
Dude he literally just admitted that the gyno was not from the weed and he lied.. like Izzy wyd bro
Man what a fight, I have much more respect for Izzy as a fighter and a person after this bout.  Can't wait for the rematch.
He looks upset. He's just trying not to show it
Izzy fought a great fight and props to him for taking the loss like a man and like a champ.  Alex's size for the division and his power are completely off the charts.
Imagine this guy thinks he could beat Jon jones 💀💀💀💀💀
Amazing fighter.
3:01 Jordan Belfort
I'm just glad there are no more "Nigerian" champions. I'm sick of hearing about it.....also had to edit... He's  great fighter, but he is a douche bag !!!
8:22 and he did it again!
Alex pereira is your dad 😂🤣🤣🤣3-0
The strength of Izzy's mindset. Oh BTW...he is better fighter than Pereira too.
Bro be thankful the ref stop the fight, alex would have killed you ,you were out on your feet
Izzy is a class act…understands the risks, doesn’t make any excuses and accepts the results win or lose. Much respect💯
Why did he dress up like an orangutan 🦧
Pereira He have again so much luck
Izzy looked in danger every second of that fight.😬
It was a very good and much justified stoppage. Do you guys not notice how hard Pereira hits. The man is made of steel.  If the referee had not stopped the fight  Adesanya would have ended up knocked out and probably with a permanent damage . The stoppage saved him and let's him have a continued career and opportunity to come back . A devastating ko could have been so damaging that he would have not be the same again. Good stoppage for everybody including the UFC who banks on more Adesanya fights. Congratulations to Pereira. Deserved Champion.
Go Alex about time a bloke shut this guy up
All respect to him
Respect for not flinching at all in taking this fight. He took a risk, he's done it many times. More champions need to follow his example.
was rooting for Alex! we gotM
Aye, at least it is still "fuck Monster" 😂
He still looks like the boss with that orangutan fur!
please give that nice ladies coat back , lol
Got to give it to him as the interviewer said “this was on of your better performances” Arguably one of his best matches imo
He is concussed like mfer. You can tell his brain is shook
Graceful and styling in defeat...even though he was winning most of the fight.
Always humble wat a great fighter . Alex too dude hits with some bombs gunna be fun to see him fight next
Respect he came to the press conference after a defeat grown man attitude
Love you izzy, u still the champ 🏆
Izzy the man!!!
Everyone is winning until they're lost....
fuск реrreirа
I still respect my champ#adesanya..no body is perfect..he lost but he never failed his fans expectations..
He fought very well respect
Izzy is without questions a tough dude,no doubt about that. He is also the best champion the UFC could ever have,always taking fights, always taking the risk even though some of his fights end up being quitw boring. That being said I completely disagree with the approach with wich he is taking this lost, none will ever believe he was lucid in those final moments. My man was out on his feet and that is a common occurrence,just because he didn't fall to the canvas doesn't mean you weren't out cold.
He is no job Jones don’t ever compare him to the goat
Izzy still dat dude
Izzy prolly has Hyperthyroidism.
I like Adesenya but that was a good stoppage it was about to get much worse
A class act. Looking forward to seeing him back. and also f*** hans molenkamp
if khamzat fights he wont be stopped
Sorry Izzy, but your leg gave out because you got hit on the chin, not because he kicked you in the leg lmao
As someone who initially didn't care much for Adesanya, I've watched every fight since he joined the UFC. I've been back and watched many of his kickboxing fights also, and truly grown to respect and admire the young man. His fight IQ is something rarely seen in MMA and his professionalism and attitude towards defeat, particularly in this story arc with his arch nemesis just makes me even more hyped for the rematch.  Congratulations to Alex for his new Title and to Izzy for being an absolute legend and top man all around.  Thanks for posting 🙏
Alot of respect for Adesanya! He's very graceful in defeat which is rare these days and shows respect to everyone! Love seeing that respect and class is still present in fighters! Great performance for Issy and hopefully he'll come back for a rematch and take back what is his
Which bear for the backlash?
Still the goat.
Best MW match ever ! Literally I had 2-2 going into the 5th but I remember when Izzy walked back to the corner after the 4th I knew he would lose he HAD NOTHING LEFT he always tripped
Izzy was trying to coast to a decision round 4 and 5 and got found out. The hungrier fighter is gonna get ya one of these days when you fight to not lose-- that day came.
This foo STILL talking? Lol. Give respect already. Fake ass energy. Yeaaaa keep that shit.
Hell make the adjustments and win , his leg was having issues the whole fight couldn't move like he normally does and nearly Flatliners dude in the first round. I think people sleep on his punch power an accuracy too.
Despite the fact that I was going for Pereira, BIG RESPECTS TO ADESANYA, close fight and this comes show us anything can happen at the end!
I get having some issues with him but if you can't respect this man then I can't respect you
My wife cheated on me in 2017 with a man named robert. Since then, we got divorced and she got the kids. This spiralled into me losing my job and becoming homeless. I have always hated robert for ruining my life but not as much as i hate Adesanya
Not the year for the Nigerian champs same thing for the fights also dominating the fights and then getting caught at the end of fight
Izzy is gonna have a psychological block, to conquer a champion who has defeated you 3 times to gain the championship you lost. Like a ghost that haunts alex came and stole his light but he should like Ali have the comeback!
Notice how izzy gets rid of the monster water I've heard there is beef with monster and some fighters?!?!?!
I really thought he would do it.  Still like Izzy , stuff happens.
Comes out looking like a Jabari warrior lol #BP3
If he didnt stay against the cage he would have won by points. Izzy my favorite fighter. But that ego that he admits having is going to challenge him.  He barely blocked punches.
looks like Pereira is determined to beat Adesanya in every combat sport.
To say that “he was fine” was a little ridiculous. He was out on his feet.
Izzy is a class act, and a warrior. Wish him all the best and a speedy recovery.
He didn’t deserve rematch!!! Guy beat sh*** out of him and next one is Khamzat in title shot.
Izzy has class in loss
Isreal forget one important thing the passion of Alex and Alex always saving his punches for the last.And yes the ref has do good job to stop the fight because Alex knee was about to comes and Isreal will be the same as Usman Nigerian lizard.
The stoppage was good.  It actually reminded me of when CG lost the 2nd time to TJD.
No rematch first Izzy has to win a couple of fights then maybe a rematch KO LOL
Izzy was the better fighter
He was lucidly getting FOOKED UP. Goddard saved him from serious brain damage. No fighter is ever the same after being KO’d. The next 1-2 punches were  going to starch him.
Deserves immediate rematch 100%.
Last rounds just move around don’t sit in the cage at all
He almost seem happy. His next fight will be worth much more and he can be a 2x champ now if he wins. He doesn’t have to worry about all of the championship obligations for right now.
This guy i quiet like, but he is not very humble, and Pereira might be a more deserving champion.
Based on that jacket, I am glad he lost.
Let's go legend rematch
He looks like he saw a ghost. I would think he would be slightly relieved
Hearing that Izzy has stuff he’s dealing with makes me feel genuinely sad
Izzy won two rounds...because of the wrestling  Alex convincing won...three rounds...and 3 and 0 against izzy
Dude is wearing a fur coat like he is going into a blizzard
Rematch till izzy wins
Izzy fighting someone bigger than him losing was something everyone overlooked. This why Jon jones don’t come back because if he was to fight someone his size he’d loose
Sucks to think Alex loses the belt to a wrestling
Damn I lost all my bet on hoping Izzy get the sub win but it turn into a ko match daaaaammn my 1$ for 100$
Izzy dizzy it was hilarious to see the dude running cause he knew dam well he couldnt stand and bang maybe now it will make izzy more humble instead of thinking he is god and is untouchable cause there is always someone better out there Alex deserves that belt he knew he had to dig deep and go for the knockout to win
“ADCC-sanya” lol… Never heard that before. Gold
lol
The loss transformed him into a Lion
Izzy’s striking never looked better than today. He was throwing with more speed and power than I have ever seen.   The rematch will be rediculous but I don’t see Izzy ever beating Alex
Natural born power like Perreira can't be learned and it's like a sword he has in a knife fight because when he commits its over. If he's just fighting you without going full blast because he doesn't want to empty the tank you stand a chance. When he uncorks, unless you're born with that power, you get wrecked in a blow for blow, and at the end of a fight you're more likely to make mistakes and get hit so Alex's combination of power and precision beats Izzyz superior striking technique when both parties are more vulnerable to receiving strikes and that's what happened. Izzy got tired -as is expected for both since its a 5 round fight- and that created the openings for Perreiras power. Great fight. I picked Petreira to win but it was much closer than I thought.
Even if u get ko in 1seconds U are still a champion 💪💪💪
I think Izzy could greatly benefit from GSP and learn his double leg timing to take Alex down in their next bout. Great fight champ, you will be back stronger.
Adesanya's team is right, as stated Cormier: "Adesanya would not have changed this. That was going to continue. It would have ONLY GOTTEN WORSE, if they didn't stop the fight. He was gone". If the referee had not stopped the fight at that moment, there would have been a great chance that Adesanya would once again need an oxygen mask. The symbolism of defeat would be even more overwhelming, the "psychological scar" would be more serious and deeper, in addition to the athlete's own physical safety that would be at great risk.
0-3😳 I don’t think it’s a war Izzy
"Dare to be great and I am" absolutely legendary
So happy pereira won soooo happy 💪💪💪
PEREIRA HAPPENED
If that fight went on 10 more seconds he was lights out on the canvas no discussion
Give pereira his flowers adesanya you got beat 3 times by this guy
get a loss after talking about epstein/maxwell... too predictable.
That's CAP he was dead on his feet.....arms limp!
Fight was amazing from both fighters 🙏
Did he kill the kyuubi ??
Izzy on sucide watch
Aljaminini better take notes
My chap! Should have stayed dancing being a target to this assassin is risky but all in all dominant
Close fight. Izzy respected periera power to much. Needed to really try to open him up
It was an early stoppage if you actually watch, when he had his hands down he was still bobbing and weaving, those punches weren’t landing. He was still protecting himself.
Izzy was not fine. He was about to be put out. He wasn't still moving well. He was out on his feet, and Alex is accurate and deadly powerful. He was gonna be snoring in a second
HE WASNT LUCID HE WAS LOOSIN...
Blablabla you ain't nothing you're time is donne even your wa Te fuck are you wearing 😂😂
Glass Chin Izzy
Nobody told Israel that coat makes HIM look like an O..RANGU...TANG! Ya'll cool with that coat too... lmao
Pereira is a beast,,congrats
Alex was much more bigger then ISRAEL
He should get a rematch.
This is the sport. No shame in losing to trained killers. Win like a champ lose like a champ it happens. Was a great fight
His loss just makes me love UFC more. The fact that u can have someone clean threw a whole division. Just to lose. Alex P will not be clearing threw top 10 contestants like Paulo, or Rob, or Marvin. Mark my words he will be challenged
He’ll overcome from d lose but how he’ll overcome from d tweets that Jon’s gonna shoot?
This fight could have been crazy boring too, and it’s probably in my top 10 fights all time for pure story and the excitement
I decided to look like a grizzly bear after losing the fights
This Sportmanship. He deserves a win next time.
Izzy had it bruh I seen the fight but he was just to over confidence with his skills like he kept tryna showboating
This is not wakanda man 😂 u got rocked.
WOW is all I can say Your Best performance you lit him up!! and he was saved from KO at the bell!! 3 rounds to 1 not even close they better give you a rematch we all know who the better fighter is!!!  there's got to be a rematch!!
Still arrogant ni...get loss😆😆😆😆
My two favorites lost their belts this year. First Usman now Izzy. Twilight zone man
Happ hes done, anime painted nail loer bo.
3 LOSSES OVER HOW MANY YEARS...CRAZY!
Complete fool, glad to see him loose.
Next time Izzy u gotta smack him when he traps u, or get out of there (slip left right like football, then switch it up next time) that’s what I think you need to do best him. A combination of the two. But when he throws u gotta scare him mane
What a clown
He's wearing an orangutan.
He is still in my top 3 favorite fighters. And technically, his records are still better than Alex's record. So he is still the better pro. Much love Izzy.
Israel is gracious in defeat and keeps it professional, salute to this man
So glad he lost
What's up with the pearls?
if he only knew how to submit... had alex and could of taken his neck but 0 ground skills!
What a self-absorbed c*nt. He doesn't acknowledge Pereira beat him, he thinks it's because HE PUT IT ON THE LINE. When he was doing th same things he does every fight. He thinks he lost because he's great. Always been a boy, and a clown.
Thank You Izzy ! That’s it that’s the comment ! ✊🏾💯
his coat is a masterpiece :D
If there were no rounds Izzy could’ve stopped him early
Izzy reacting to the loss better than everyone else is why he’s up on that table and not us
No excuses! I believe he will bounce back.
Brother i know this gonna happen even after usman fight but the truth is that Nigeria is cursed right now and anything that connected to it is going down so i advise you disconnect yourself from that name nigeria for your own good bro
I've always loved Izzy's style, and you have to respect how he's taking this L. But, when I saw him wearing the Chinese flag into the ring in glory I stopped being able to root for him the same way.
Round 1 what could have been
With a coat like that I'm glad he lost 🤣
Welp, i hope Alex decides to be active.
That’s my mothers fur coat those robbers stole
Bring back Steve mazagatti and Mario Yamasaki 🤣🤣
Sad to see him go out like that. I was convinced Izzy was gonna TKO pierrear but both are savages so man shit happens
Good fucking sport
Bring back steve mazzagatti 😂
Jesus .. what are u wearing .. smh such a 🤡
Izzy is hard to dislike. Just seems like a good guy with a good personality. I think he’d be an amazing fight commentator for the ufc some day when his fighting days are done.
Damn ugly jacket.
Heyy Idol, you have a great fight with him I believe you can beat him nextime he almost lost again, round 3 is your time to kill him I think you need to improve your grappling coz u have a good striking use it for you better again you're still the best My Idol Izzy! 🤗🤜 Lets go Alex Vs Izzy 2 in ufc!
“I’ve got some things to attend to”… aka immediate leg surgery for a fractured tibia 🦴
This man even loses like a champion. He has a lot to teach still.
I really like this man.
If he won he would've talked all night instead he's got some shit to do: yeah cry like a baby! Lmao
Izzy knows to accept defeat, true professional fighter ❤️
Great Champion
If there wasn't a cage Israel would have won, but that's not why I'm here the real question is how many miles do you think he can cover in a single fight running backwards?!
That steve mazagatti line was clean
A solid great in combat and mental warfare. Class act and manages to be a nice person over his savage mind set. Greatness.
Dude looks like headless Chewbacca
He’s still a champ in my eyes. I like Alex but that was an early stoppage
history repeats itself
He lost, but spoke like a champion!
WTF is he wearing 😂
When he fell didn’t even get hit and he looked stunned, he needs to get checked something just wasn’t right , a lot of mma. Fans talk a lot of crap but truly you are a great champ
I like this guy
Great champion with no excuses.
I love this guy so much,Izzy💓. But losing 3 time to one guy,I think no need for rematch now,take it Izzy Bro,just wait for your time.
You kept talking about being the daddy of costa, vettori and whittaker, guess now your Daddy is here gynosenya.
That one guy you can never beat
you were going to sleep shut up
He'll be back still one of the all time greats ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Izzy was frozen, like Elsa ❄️
He's got your number and you can use any excuse but it's just an excuse!
This match seemed set up wtf was he doing against the fence
Dude looks ridiculous with that fur coat...
“This ain’t over, this is still war” bro even if you won it’d be 3-1 it’s over g🤣🤣🤣
You got yo ass BEAT LMAO!!!!
Its always nice to see a cocky prick get humbled
Humble in defeat true champ
How is he not sweating his ass off in that coat 🥵
legend still
he finally fought some one his size / bigger
This guy is a true warrior.  So impressed with his demeanor after losing.  He will always be a world class fighter and one of the best.
He is staying positive simple but this is the third time he got dominated by Alex so I can feel him. Everyone knows that he is speed but he cannot take Alex punch even in the future. Every dogs has it’s day! @@@
Off Alex’s dick he’s getting his head kicked off in the rematch😂🤣🤣🤘🏽
He always saying stuff about is health, longevity and not getting hit, so he should be grateful Goddard stopped the fight right
Sucks man he was up 4-0 fighting a cheating light hevwayweight
Early stoppage
Lol that jacket
That boy writes checks his body can't cash. Like talking about Jon Jones.
Izzy has two losses for the same reason.  Gotta work on that wrestling.
One left hook and he is out, Pereira has power!
Everybody has a bogeyman.
Had he not hang in the corner, if he moves around, AP could not have been able to attack him.
Noone can ever say Izzy dodged ANYONE. Ever.
Class act, bravo Izzy 👏
Adesanya has some crazy leg kicks. The way he whips them is terrifying. He just needs to come back and utilize his grappling, keep getting stronger.
Izzy deserved this W and revenge not sure where he goes from here
Asymmetric gyno is generally an indication of steroid abuse. That's why people keep mentioning it. Given Adesanya's background of wealth and privilege, the idea of him being able to acquire bio-identical steroids in order to beat the tests is a real possibility.
Excuses
does he have a sponser? why does he keep hiding that monster?
This is one of the best cards I've ever seen. Nothing went to the judges. Alex Pereira is Lurch. Izzy's stand up is great for point fighting, but he lacks true power. Lurch never respected his power and Izzy got a little sloppy that final round. Awesome fight. I wonder if Pereira has his number
Israel Adesanya is a hell of a fighter period! Sport is a funny business, I watched the whole fight, Alex has done well to defeat Israel, true champ indeed, but I think that fight really deserves a second chance.....I feel Israel could have won this fight, if only he could have played it better and understood that he was ahead and played it safe for the remainder of the fight....part of me realises that Adesanya's loss was nothing but a result of wanting to completely overhelm Alex just so as to settle down the previous loss . I really think he wanted to pay revenge so much that he wanted everyone to make it clear to everyone that He is better than Alex....I think he has a potential to defeat Alex, just play it like Floyd Mayweather when you are ahead
What is he wearing ? He killed a entire pack of Foxes hahaha 😂👏 . I'm a Adasenya fan anyway
It's not so easy when you're not fighting people a lot smaller than you, is it?
I burp everytime I'm put on the spot too. It's weird...
He's so convinced he would have stayed up. Alex was literally smashing his brain back and fourth and even if he was lucid one more punch he would be out cold.
Can feel the pressure of getting hit hard everytime he was against the fence
This fake wakandan is soon to be gone.. he will never NEVER be champ again
bruh was eating punches left and right but he says they should havent stopped the fight, lol.
Sick of the dare to be great shit  Shut up  Everytime he loses  Dare to be great   🤡
I love Izzy he’ll be back
He was running away the whole fight
Classy MF. He's a champ no matter the outcome of a fight,
Izzy is a better fighter mother fucker just has gods gift of power like wilder does
He got his head wobbled, if it was allowed to continue i think he'd get sparked out cold.
Great fight but Izzy can't beat Alex especially in 4 oz gloves. It was apparent that he was concerned with Alex's power throughout the match. Izzy isn't just able to stand there and counterpunch like he did with other opponents since Alex is a kickboxer himself
Damn he was winning too again before that left hook lmao
Hit and run didn’t worked out this time 😂😂 Finally we have a strong champion named Alex
Got way more respect for izzy after that fight
Just goes to show how brutal this sport is.  Someone with such a dominant run, losing like that… Izzy has all of my respect, classy in defeat .   Also nobody talks about Periera almost getting KO’d in the first   I mean I cashed out on periera 💰 but I wanted izzy to win
He wants to go 4-0 lol
Dude Izzy's the man idgaf if he lost. He had a good undefeated run. Still doesn't change how much work he put in to get that title and to keep it. He gets a rematch so let's get it then homie. Dope ass fight tho both fighter laid it down. 🙌🏽🤘🏽👊🏽😎💨💯
He should have grappled more in round five and stayed off the fence.
I don't know if it's a real or public performance(probably a bit of both) but Adesanya's mentality is by far his greatest strength. Man's poker face in public never falters. Just incredible. I hope he runs it back.
Izzy will be back, Congratulations Champ AP
Izzy is the man, Alex is a monster excellent fight. Both men are warriors.
Man that was insane
Huge respect to Israel, great man, great entertainer, great fighter, grat person. You won a fan here bro! You'll recover and get stronger, clear your mind of the past and overcome your enemy! I am sure you will do! Need more guys like him, took the Loss with integrity and stoicism!
Good stoppage by ref Izzy would of been carried out if it wasn’t stopped
Had Izzy back pedaling almost the whole fight. And even turned him into GSP with those take down attempts lol. Good fight
He got lazy in the 5th .. he had to know that Alex was coming for him.. Izzy was playing the clock game..
Izzy was doing great. Alex is a tough mofo tho. I feel when Izzy would go forward. He was putting it on alex
Izzy drunk/wanna burb/ but still cool headed. Respect! Am a fan of Periera but yes Respect to Izzy. I admit HE is a legend.
“Bring back Steve Mazzagadi” I was crying. Izzy wants to die 😭😂
He can’t even admit when he’s been beaten, it’s disgusting
You can be lucid like he was, but you lose the ability to do anything, so him saying he was lucid and still up and moving doesn't mean much,  that's why there's a "standing knockout". Because you can be essentially knocked out and still stay upright, you have to look at his arms which were down,   and his body which was slumped over, plus the fact Alex had just landed a devastating right hand to the side of his head.  So the ref stopping it was the right call.
I like the way he handled this
I dont like him but this is how u take a loss. Congrats to him for that
That is a bad coat
The guy who is seated in the bar looking at the tv saying I beat that ufc champion years ago on glory just beating you again and stole your belt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣funny right  Hats off for adesania after the fight and congrats poatan Brasil is  patacho all over the place
I love how he took off that monster water and got regular water, fuck fake promotions
that jacket tho haha
The only time Izzy was ever in trouble was when he had his back to the fence. He kept getting himself in that same position but he was dominating in every other aspect
Man, I am really happy to see the comments so supportive of this guy.  He has been one of the best ufc champs we’ve ever had, his only loss before this was moving up a weight class, he fights often, and he’s being humble af in defeat
There’s absolutely no need for a rematch. Like Izzy even said himself, the EXACT same thing happened in kickboxing.  Once is a fluke, twice means he just has your number.
Izzy is a real G. Great fight. But he'll win it back.
It was a good stoppage he was out on his feet . I like Izzy but it was more than the caf kicks he got hit more than once  Good fight
He's humble now, already wearing thrift store sht.
I like him
Just like in the real world,  the soft champ got served dinner hot Poatan
Izzy need to be in beast mode to ever defeat Alex who operates on beast, unrelenting mode all through ..  at same time, don't risk your life and future.
great job
Steve Mazzagatti! Haha! Honestly, the fight plays out the same way if there's a rematch. Whenever Alex pressed, he tagged Izzy and then accepted Izzy's clinch until he didn't. The power differential between the two will always favor Alex to come out on top even if Izzy lands more combos. Everyone talks about Alex's power but nobody mentions his fight IQ, patience and shot selection. Izzy's greatest kryptonite is another smart kickboxer who is his height, his reach and a more powerful hitter than him.
On the bright side, I like what this does to the division. Now we should get Whitaker vs Pereira, Izzy vs Strickland, etc etc.
Trying so hard to not act shook
Please give izzy a rematch. He will finish him
Izzy drop the team go train with machachev i think its time to grow from your people they holding you back. Imo
One reff allows Meatball Molly's face to be punched into a pulp while the other reff steps in too soon and doesn't allow the champion to defend himself and to recover.  Izzy got hurt for sure, but i still think the reff stopped it too soon.  But hey, that's how it goes right?  Izzy wasn't blameless. The only time he was in a position to get knocked out was when he had his back against the fence. He should have learned in round one to stay away from there, but every round he ended up there playing with fire in that small space.
Israeli can talk sh*% but he is humble in defeat.... takes the loss and he will be back.
Fighters are delusional , for izzy to say he wasnt out ,thats crazy , he was one big punch away to be put to sleep
Early stoppage
Izzy is the most awesome guy. He truly is an ambassador of the sport. I hope him and Kamara get their belts back. But well done to Pereira. He's done extremely well for 5 fights and is very dangerous. I still think Izzy has a better skill set and is a better ambassador for this sport. His diplomacy and public skills are second to none.
“I could see everything” is looking at the floor the entire time
Alex chased him down the whole night and finally caught him, again! What a fight. Let’s see a fourth. Alex got him 3-0 now.
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Journalists should start asking questions with a bit more empathy and they might get good answers they can actually write articles about. He just explained why he lost what kind of a question is "you and Usman both lost, like what happened?" What kind of a journalist talks like that firstly but also Izzy doesn't owe you any further explanations your not his dad so stop demanding them, he lost his movement and got caught simple.
Izzy the division is still yours man. Your a living legend & we all look forward to you coming back & taking that belt back. Rest up G! Heavy I s the head that wears the crown.
izzy still is the man.
Class
😂😂😂😂 glad he got F up
look at this orangutan. good to see this human humbled. makes me happy.
Khabib salty as Fuck.....Never put this scrub on the same level as Jon Jones.....Izzy can never be the Goat 0-3 against one man lol we don't wanna see a Quadrilogy
Alex is like this guys kryptonite. Every time hes up on the scorecards and then alex comes in vlutch in the later rounds.
monkey
Gf my guy , class and you'll be back
Only thing Izzy lacked in the fight was going for the finish and putting a stamp on it. Nearly had it but sometimes he coasts like Anderson.
Once you learn about the story behind the monster energy clown guy and Israel removing the cans from the table you're gonna cry tears every time 😂😂😂
the litty things like knowing the names of the reporters + employees is what makes him great
Doesn’t matter that he lost Izzy is and will forever be a Fuckin beast!🐐🔥🔥🔥
Still the goat Izzy f… that caveman!
If the ref never stopped the fight he was looking for some serious injuries   Alex could have started kneeing him in the face nd stated teeing off on him, out come would have been much worse for Izzy
thats sportsmanship at its best ..
Love izzy but dude looks like a yeti
Bet on Alex at the beginning of Round 5 at +1100
Wasn't an Izzy fan FOREVER.....but his talent was to much to ignore.....now I am a fan because he shows up....makes weight......puts on a good show. He'll be BACK.
The atitude is gold!👊
Now he has more time to play video games and play dress up.
Bro I love this guy this is how a champion takes a lose
I've predicted it over a month ago...Good job Alex🦾👊and ppl used to say he'd beat Bones 😅 very wishful thinking 🧘‍♂️
As a champion, you became arrogant. There are always tougher guys out here to whip your butt. You still do not appreciate the stoppage. Your head was down, you were becoming a zombie.  in the sequence, you were defenseless, and he punches your head 15 times. At least 10 shots are full power.  3 or 4 more seconds means 3 or 4 more clean shots on your head, and you would suffer brain damage. Be grateful to the ref. He saved your life. Change your attitude and you will become an even better fighter. If you ever face Pereira again, make sure you take him out early. With proper planning, you can do it because you are sleeker and faster. Be aware that you can't put him away with one shot, and know that your chink can't handle his power because, in the ring, he is the stronger and bigger man. Next time, when you see him in the octagon, you will remember these punches. They will hinder your ability to execute your plan. You have to be humble and know your weakness or else the result would be the same.
I think its Kharma that came back for Izzy.  There is a fine line between having the confidence that it takes to be a champion and allowing the ego to take over.  I always felt it was such a douche bag move when he KO'd Costa and then mounted him from behind and pretended to hump his ass.  Izzy is very lucky the referee stepped in and it was only a TKO.  If the ref had not stepped in when he did, Izzy would have gotten knocked out cold again and it would not be the same story going forward.  If he had been KO'd by Alex again, the rematch would not be happening right away.  Personally I would have rather seen the KO.  Alex is going to be the king for a while.
This will need interesting attention. No one touches Izzy in this division now what? Can he ever best Alex? IDK man. Maybe they just become boys 🤣🤣
boring fighter, relies on size and reach to point fight and keep it safe.
He lost
most swag humble mother fucker  ... love it
Glad this clown got knocked out 😂
You king of legend styilbander🙏👍
Izzy is a legend - his character/ his mentality is elite
Bring back Steve Mazzaggati! lol
Adesanya needed to eat this humble pie long time ago
I really hope he can bounce back from this and show he is still in the game
I swear to god all you better love Alex when he gets mopped up but rob paulo Marvin Jared or anyone with an once of good grappling.😊
Poatan destroyed him  3 to none so 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Izzy has become a cartoon.
You saw it in his eyes, he was terrified.
He is so overated. Glad he exposed
You got knocked TFO My “Nigga”
I know the leg was compromised felt like he was trapping izzy against the cage alot. Where's the t kick to make space
Three orangutans died to make that jacket.
I'm not into Izzys persona outside of the octagon but you can't deny his talent and ability.  The better man one last night. Izzy fought a great fight but sometimes shit doesn't go your way. He will no doubt eventually hold the belt again.
Respect for Israel Adesanya, He was technically more superior.. Those switch stance is incredible.. It is just that Pereira is a freak of nature. Great technical fight that end with big bomb.
Where can I get that Chewbacca costume.
Alex looked like a damn heavyweight. That was an incredible weight cut performance.
The facts tho, he will never outlive this triple loss
Gotta love Izzy. To be fair he reminded me how great he was that fight. But he came up against an absolute beast, no shame in it at all
respect adesanya!! you are a true warrior you will rise again champ!!!
this was Usman and Leon moment all over again...
He's gonna get his get back he was winning he's gonna comeback he's the 2nd longest reigning champ he got this he's this generations Silva fosho
Both Usman & Israel lost their titles?!?!? 😂 Francis is next 😂
RIP Chewbacca
Destroy him guess what LOL 🤣
Why is it that black men have a hard time admitting that they got beat up by a white man. Walking around talking I will never lose to a white boy like if were beneath them. All these lies got them feeling themselves like they Superior in physicality and aggression. Like white people are supposed to fear them you bleed just like me and can be dealt with just like me.
Hes so relaxed now. All week he knew he was getting finished. He's back to Izzy and not iz he scared
Alex looks like a velociraptor in the ring.  Terrifying.
Can I just say. Much respect to Izzy.  He's done the work, reached the top and brought so much attention to his division. Whether it's good or bad.  Both men are warriors and it's just ashame one has to lose
I've gained more respect for Israel in defeat. He fought an excellent fight. He had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.
Lmao yall praising this man fir actually having to fight😂😂😂. Izzy fans are hilarious asf😂😂😂😂😂😂
Damn, I’m a fan and was hoping he would win, but Alex is a monster. I wanna see Alex vs khamzat!
I've never liked Isreal Adesanya. But after this loss, he made a new fan. Dude is Humble in victory and defeat.
You lost accept it your ego is what brings you down
That coat kills any sympathy I might have had
He comes off really arrogant and cocky. Big ego.
This guy is all class! Always a winner!
All respect  and so humble in victory and defeat! Izzy will be back and last night he just got caught in a fight where he showed better skills and was ahead of Alex!  Congrats to Alex where he showed a lot of durability and beautiful kickboxing skills!  It was a high level beautiful match!!
He and Usman both gracious in defeat
How much is a wookie coat going for these days? Poor Chewy…
How was it possible for Alex to cut so much weight he looked huge.  You would think the older he gets the harder will be to cut
He does all the theatrics and dancing to help sell for Dana (pay per views).  But honestly, you can tell he’s a humble positive dude.  Don’t get too high or too low.  Take time to recover, and just get back to work.
izzy so much smaller, but still brought the fire big time
lost the belt but still handled defeat with class like a champion
Izzy is a champion belt or no belt, this is that energy
Alex is 200 plus on fight night is basically cheating
Before the fight, I told yall Israel wasn't going to do any of the things he said to Alex. Now you see?
it's all part of the legend this guy is the goat
hhhhhh he fuck u up
Weak boy finally exposed this time.  No knockout power. Nowhere to run. 😆😆😆
Idiot talks shit Talk to your mother This style fuck  shit fuck Stupud  idiot u will never win again
Hahaha bro salty asf 😂😂😂
I made it b**** you got knocked the f*** out
This guy ran out the ring without talking to anyone. Now he's up here running his mouth about refs, background issues and weight. This loudmouth worm just can't admit he couldn't put Alex away. He tried everything to win, including wrestling. It wasn't enough. Alex is a straight KILLER compared to this fur coat wearing diva. AND NEW!!! #3-0
i think it was early stoppage.  he was still bobbing and weaving didn't give him a chance to come back from it if the shots were connecting, different story...
How can anyone wear that
Alex just ruined his life.
What?! Does he have cancer why did he bring up chad not the same lmao
Lmfao all yall Izzy fans only can praise your daddy in a moment of defeat😂😂. Yall talked all that bs and your daddy lost. Yall are trying to find something good about this situation now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
that coat looks incredible on him 💥💥💥
From the first round, he kept backing himself up into the cage. When they engaged in the middle of the ring, adesanya was Fucking him up. Pereira, that fucking terminator, just kept coming.
He should of tried taking him to the ground when he was I'm trouble
Great champ. Alex is a 205 guy miraculously making 185.
That fur is cringe AF. Nobody should wear that crap.
Lucid 😂 his head was away to come off!
I'm very glad poatan won but big respect for izzy. He's gracious in defeat. I respect that.
The stoppage was good. The dude would of turn you into Prichard colon . With all due respect to colon because he got out in that stage thanks to a dumb ref and a dirty fucking fighter.
come down to earth now never be haughty and proud
Early stoppage   He was obviously hurt but he was ducking and moving his head from side to side trying to dodge puncheds wheb the reff stopped it   I've seen fighters hurt worse and the reff keeps the fight going
Jon Jones enters the chat
I think sometimes fighters have a warriors spirt and think they're okay when they're really not.
So what is causimg hos gyno then ?
I think they stopped it too fast... especially considering how much time McAnn was getting her head beat in before they stopped that fight
This dude gets more full of shlt every time talks
“Bring back Steve Mazzagatti” hahahaha awesome
he is chewbacca now? this guy needs to stay away from pereria, he hit perenneal nerve...wtf?? it was more like hook to the chin. he is lucky the referee saved his life from another massive ko highlight. he has no buisness with pereira.
Izz is a good champion.
He might have gained more fans from this loss than all his previous wins.
It’s not the leg it’s the punches to the face
Glad this dude lost
Respects to you Champ. Straight class man
arrogance got you ex champ---grateful? try a little humility
😂😂 “I’m not fucking leaving”
The GREATEST
Izzy saying he wouldn’t have got knocked out is cap he was seconds to being on the canvas face first
Disneylandworld and money took his soul. He’s done and will be just like the rest of the fighters that lose the belt.
That was great fight
Izzy has fought  murderers since he’s had the title. Bravo. He’ll get it back no doubt.
Gotta love the fact that izzie is reppin all the Chewbacca cosplayers we thought ye forgot about us
Stylebender got humbled by the Final boss
Bro is hurting inside, scared in the ring. “I could see everything yet I couldn’t block or move my hands” stupid tinto
What a good dude , with his attitude he'll remain champ
I love how he handles himself in defeat 💪, can’t wait for the rematch
Estrogen Sussysanya
🥴
If you can't except your setbacks in life...then you definitely can't handle prosperity....More athletes ..More People need to follow Isreal actions...
Gracious in victory and defeat. Gotta respect it. He fought a great fight
A lot of guys would have been out early in that fight. Gotta respect Izzy those guys put a performance on.
Cant waiy for the rematch and trilogy
Not bad for some guy Adesanya made fun of for living in a favela. Fuck this loud mouth
Still supporting you bro 🙌👏Izzy Foever....
Adesanya I'm out of your fan good bye.you can never beat jonjone...coz..ur a..very very.......
Isreal lost the fight because he backed himself to the rope, then he couldn’t escape the hammering, he should have been moving around. Dude is bigger than him
Respect!!!
This was his best performance so far I have gotten respect for him. I thought Alex would beat the shit out of him but he was quick and Alex started stiff
It was a great fight. I respect them both for putting on a good show🔥👍🏼
Big respect to Izzy, still cracking jokes and staying positive after such an amazing fight against an insanely tough opponent, honestly thought if izzy had another second in the first it was lights out for pereira
Gracious in defeat but why is he wearing a woman’s fur coat?
I’ve seen it all in his body language before the fight it wasn’t like his other fights sucks but I’m ready to see him get it back  And the Nigerians are losing their belts one by one
Keep running away Izzy 😅 hiring fuck
He's going to come back
i wasnt supprised on alex win i love izzy he will remmberd as one of the best all respect
thank god....look at this cringefest . still acting like he knocked out alex in 5 seconds even after the TKO loss. imagine how would he react if he won the fight and the reaction from his 10 year old cartoon lovers
Classy
Dangerous on the ground? No no Izzy ur not. Get some coaching from the Dagestanis then come with ur stories about ur ground fighting
There were still over 2 minutes when he got rocked and was out for a moment. Pereira wasn’t gonna let the foot off the gas. Not an early stoppage at all.
i don’t remember anyone making fun on chadwick boseman for being skinny i think most people didn’t know he had cancer till he passed
He crying in the inside.
Tru soldier of the art of war, never be overly emotional… he’ll be back
you're lucky it was stopped otherwise you would be waking up in a hospital bed...anyways Alex is champ and feed izzy too chimaev ..
Dude is a great role model.
I wanted Pereira to win because I hate that stupid fuckin fur coat.😆
He knew he was gona lose. He can't beat that guy
LEGEND Adesanya!
So Izzy going to get a booby job
He had Alex rocked he got saved by the bell
No rivalry after the same guy beat you three time. Who's Elsa now.
3-0
nah man I don’t understand the hate on this dude. Mans rly seems like a down to earth and wise man that took this loss like a champ
Champ stuff only
I think it was a good stoppage. Felt like Goddard gave him literally the exact right amount of time to get a defense going. In the end, if you're standing there with your hands down and getting hit repeatedly in the head that's a textbook TKO.
Fought like a champ, took the L like a champ. He may lost the belt but izzy is a champ, that's for sure.
Was a great fight! Wow And Alex was saved by the bell at the end of the first. Both men are going to be fun to watch in in the futire
Awesome fight. 👌
He try to cruise through fights …. Some people have that kill mentality Izzy try to display everything he trained for in one fight … so when pressure gets turned up the right way which is an controlled aggression… pressing up against him , connecting with combinations, avoiding take downs and punishment…. Then Izzy doesn’t look as confident cuz he knows your not fighting his fight
Izzy exposed Alex weakness. Alex will have a hard time against a pure wrestler. I don't believe Alex can hold that belt for 2 defensive fights.
Finally the boring wakanda fighters have fallin! The ref shouldn't have stopped the fight everyone wanted to see izzy lights out!!!
Champion attitude
Well two and 0 and kickboxing Alex's against Izzy , but now it's one and 0 in MMA , but I feel like Robert Whitaker should get the next title shot
When Izzy was a champion,people hated him ,but when he lost everyone loves him now wtf
So this is how Izzy talks when he’s mad
Honestly, I had strong gut feeling Alex gonna win by KO, didnt bet... but now once he lost in ufc I feel all that preasure will be gone from izzy. In a way he needes to cary burden of a champ going into this as a underdog... but than alex also proved he can go into championship round and recover so his confident will skyrocket, at the end of the day I think izzy gonna win it back in epic fight!
sooo MUCH RESPECT  for IZZY!!!!
Izzy needs to learn to not let someone back him into a cage like that and the times he does he needs to learn how to check hook and slide out. Watch Mayweather and how he does it.
He coulda won I think but he got to cocky and got tired but it shouldn’t have been called when he was standing
Israel lost you suck because you actually faught a real person that’s a fighter
He was saved from serious brain damage, so shouldn't doubt the stoppage at that point.
Adesanya is still a champion
Wow, pearls and fur🥴. This guy is such a dork
I wonder why Izzy accent sound more American than New Zealand
Izzy got the burp knocked out of him 😅
Atlaaaaast! We’ve been saved from interviews immaturely punctuated by false burps and arrogant comments……yay 🎉
A moins d'un sursaut mais, je crois que tu as assez joué et qu'il est temps que tu passes à autres choses car tu n'y es plus depuis tes deux derniers combats.
Man that fir is awesome I want one
I like him even more now
This guy is a lie
I thought he was gonna fight him scared how he did against other power punchers but he fought like a gangster. Great fight
You can tell behind his armor his ego is smashed. But he still acts humble in defeat. I like this Izzy, this needed to happen, now watch what he does when he comes back. He will be a wrecking ball because he is gonna want that belt back.
Very humble love Izzy
Now he look like human...humble..
love izzy but he seems like he’s having a hard time accepting his defeat. making excuses throughout the interview
This man right here is the GOAT, this interview after that fight and such a loss with the history they had and You come out call all journalists by NAME e talk the way He talked... this is way beyond winning or losing, this is Greatness.
Fim da linha pro corredor 🤜🏃
So, Alex finally made him humble👍
Honestly the way Alex was eating shots looked like a roided Overeem
Notice how he immediately pulls the Monster drink off the table. If you know you know.
I like how Izzy has respect for these reporters remembers their names and answers the questions appropriately and respectfully he's a good man
Great man , I just think more ground game is what stopped him from wining.
Wow, sincerely I'm short of words on how great people around the world have appreciated Izzy's performance last night despite the loss, that is really encouraging, # izzy will be back soon. Losing a fight may not be an issue but how you lost and how u handle your loss matters a lot.
Izzy has won 90% of fight time he’s had with Alex, and he’s still 0-3.. tough spill to swallow. 1 punch KO Power is frustrating. Izzy is definitely a better fighter and that definitely showed, the king will be back.
Gained alot of respect for Izzy, in a loss hes been more likeable then his last few wins
Dude chased him till the end of Earth - Alex persistence and determination is undeniable
That guy is not even close to as good as Izzy..u could see it last night..Izzy was taking chances he didn't have to take and got caught.
Well it’s not like he haven’t lost so. He lost to Jan, so he know how to handle L. I think L are really better than W because they make you change. Like what happened to Weili, she lost to Rose with just a headkick now she’s the champ again. Losses makes you change to become a better person. Hope Usman and Izzy both can transcend from their L.
This is going to be a trilogy fight. Unless he loses the next one.
There will be one day that the last style bender will beat his archenemy 🔥
2022 man, what a year for title changes and title fights i can’t wait for the years recap
Gracious in defeat. Respect Izzy
What a guy man, respect for taking the loss like a champ, respect to pereira. We all know Izzy will be back.
Delusional. Terrible grappling
Dopest coat!
Izzy lost them rematch to Whittaker anyway. He shouldn’t have been champion after that fight, go rewatch Whittaker 2. I think people are scoring the 4th pretty heavy for Izzy because he had the momentum from 3rd. I had 5th round 2-2.
Hopefully this is the last we see of this guy.
I really thought the last round he should have wrestled. Changed levels and put everything into one takedown.
I ain’t even gonna lie, I love that coat lol
Props tho IZZY ......was a good fight
Even a bigger fan of Izzy after defeat Everyone needs to take a lesson from this champion
My man out there with that coat looking like a baboon
Usman and Adesanya about to get back what’s theirs 😭
The champ!!! (claps)
Ah shit he lost? Thank fucking God, can't stand this guy
I’m sorry Izzy has been coasting in the last 3 to 5 fights, and he tried to up his game this time and got caught
Fight was called too early Alex= trash
If Alex beats izzy again I beat they try to get khamzat vs Alex because that’s probably the best chance khamzat has at winning
love how he says he was still there but doesnt see he was about to be put into coma
I still don't like him
Izzy talks a lot of shit before his fights. Shit happens.  3-0
The Best VS The Best... Hope it is the same in The Sport of Boxing Nowadays..I'm a Boxing Fan Though✌🏼
Bring back massagati lol
You gotta love the orangutan jacket!
Izzy looked scared to pull the trigger. Alex simply is in his head and it doesn’t appear likely he will ever beat him.
Is that male or female orang utan skin he is wearing?
I hate the allowable weight difference. Alex weighed 30 lbs more than izzy during the fight. Reminds me of Khabib cutting way down to fight smaller guys
Shit happens like your coat
2:11 Already an excuse lined up and ready to fire Omalley would be proud.
Rest of his life he will think there was ONE man he could not beat 😆😆😆😆
He would of gotten k.o cold if the ref didn't save him..
1st quarter more time Alex periera will be out !
He talked a fair amount and owned his loss, that’s all respect
Gyno surgery?
A MAN WEARING PEARLS...
gorila energy drink
His come back going to be epic
Horrible questions 😂.  Mad fight 🙏🏾 Izzy will be back
Legendary. But Alex is the future
Israel got that ass spanked.
great fight. izzy was sharp AF
All these hating mfs are pathetic, saying Adesanya should've been humble etc. They hate it when someone wins with confidence, they want soyboy champions. Man held the belt vs killers for years and was 2 minutes from a W, I think his "arrogance" is warranted.
Seeing Izzy, Amanda and Usman all lose recently is crazy. I never thought they could be beat. Wonder if Khabib would have eventually lost too.
I heard PETA will be fighting Israel next.
I don’t see what the excitement is I’ve this guy.  He runs the whole fight.
Izzy fought well I think he should bulk up some and train for the ko
Humble competent and genuine, fair play Izzy, I’m sure he will come again
Imagine wearing that coat after getting banged 🤦🏻‍♂️ clown
Excellent stoppage. It is the reason why we have this stoic post fight interview, he would most likely be knocked out otherwise and then out a year. Adesanya is as solid can be for his stance on mma scene, himself and the media.
Oh...he tossed the wig before he came out.
He's such a try hard Adesanya. So cringe. You can tell he's very insecure.
If these two start sparring with each other probably bring tha best out of both of them work with each other and get better.
He was not in control. He was performing well. I had it 2 rounds for both fighters by the 5th. I've never been a big fan of Israel, but I give him credit for talent. He lost. He got hurt. It was a good stop. Alex should of thrown a knee to finish him. Overall good fight.
People don't realize that Izzy hasn't really been getting leg kicked or a lot of kicks checked due to his skill and lack of kickboxing in his opponents. Alex was able to check and land his so I think that had a big impact because you can see Izzy movement was compromised in the 4 and 5.
Alex was like 40 pounds heavier and still almost lossed he’d ass, idk why the fight was allowed
Dude swears too much mehn, very annoying swearing while taking to the press.
Humble man, we need more of them
You will never win against Alex. Be happy with the stoppage it saved your jaw.
This was a very entertaining battle between the two, Adesanya for sure have a rival now in his division, despite the fact that he lost 3 combat contest to him 2 in Kickboxing..This dude Pereira has a very special talent. There is no doubt  that Adesanya deserves rematch just because of what he has done in that division for so long. I believe the next dude that is up and coming for the belt in the mw division is Andre Muniz, that dude is very legit.
Ahh no u weren't lucid aft the left 👊
Love him for being so cool of the loss . Man hope he win the 2nd time  👍🤗 great sportsmanship
The fact that pereira was able to pull this off proves he is the real deal and impressive
Sasquatch hide.
He wore that coat thinking he was still gonna be king of the jungle after this fight but NOPE! 😂🤣
Im glad he lost … finally He cant beat alex 3x and ur out
Pereira vs Chimaev
Praise the MMA Gods, got that POS put it his/her place...Wiggle,Wiggle,Wiggle.....Thank You Alex P..
First reaction to a big loss is to dress like the cowardly lion? Okay lmao.
They all pretend to be humble in difficult moments, the truth is actually something different, his pride does not allow him to be a true loser when he needs to be.
Props to Izzy. He went thru a lot of killers to get to the belt in the first place. I just think the previous losses to Alex was on his mind heavy for this fight. If they hadn’t met before, he would have won. But I’m sure he was haunted by those previous losses. I hope he can let it go completely and come back with a very different game plan. Secondly he should throw more as he backs up and as alex comes forward.  It is what it is. We win some. We lose some.
We all saw who's the better fighter Izzy. You are stil a champ. Bounce back black diamond
No more arrogance and rubbish-talking. Alex knocked you out just like before and he will do it again. Izzy is too rude and Alex is a humble warrior. Excuses about still being there are BS. YOU WERE OUT AND THE REF SAVED YOU!!!! Go and take a rest with your brother Usman.
No more Cockiness just tearing up and crying. Now now he's really experiencing life. He was the bully at the playground now he got destroyed. From a bigger bully but the new bullies a nice guy LOL.
Adesanya your an awesome fighter one of the best i believe you will be champion again im in your corner God bless
All class
I just don’t understand how anyone can not like this man
I still love Izzy. I'm not a trainer or pro fighter but I always tell my son who trians in boxing, " if ure in trouble with multiple and random heavy shots from your opponent at any point during fight, all u have to do, is time him and grab him to slow his  mommentum". In boxing, u will be separated by the ref, and in MMA, u will use ur opponent as support as u rest and slow him down. If u don't do the above, you will be knocked out, so just take the final risk and chance especially when u know u would win by decision.  Izzy my man, I know ur leg was compromised, but  u would have grabbed him for just 30 seconds and that would have mad a the difference. Also, even if he landed a shot, u would have used him as a support as u slow him down.  This loss was unnecessary but im still a fan and I love you, boy.  Alex, big come back after losing 3 rounds and congrats!. Ure now a legit champ, but is not still over because Izzy has always been a better fight but  not luvky and lack the power you possess. Congrat and goodluck champ.   My advice for izzy, please go for extensive check up and treatment, and add more muscle and train and get accustomed to bigger muscle mass. This is one of your weakest point. That was the reason u lost to Jan, and the reason u lost yesterday. Muscle up man.  Great fight, I lost $ 2k, but is okay because the fight was entertaining.
This cocky disco dancer got knocked the f*** out. Now look what he's wearing?. What the f****** Showboat cocky arrogant trick. He got what he deserved.
Kapir kalah hahahaha
Ridiculous jacket.
0-3
He said my eyes might have rolled back a little bit that usually means you're not fine when somebody's having a seizure and their eyes rolled back I've never heard one of them seem fine after that, not only that but maybe he has cancer according to what he was comparing the situation to ,🙃poor Chadwick rip panther
I want that coat, gorgeous.
Next time Alex will get it done quicker.
Izzy played with him a bit and didn't take a chance to finish him after the first round. Played with his food and got caught.
what's up with the coat? Peta alert
It's crazy how this fight mirrored their 2nd kick boxing matching. In that match Alex was saved by the referee and came back to KO Izzy. In this fight Alex was saved by the bell and came back to get the KO.  Izzy seems to be the better fighter, but Alez's power is a tremendous equalizer. That said, I expect Izzy to return as champ... or maybe I'm just hoping. Who the heck knows in this sport 😁
Ufc 284??? I want that main card to be nasty and he’d be fighting close to home if he does.  Side note: Izzy controls the middle instead of Alex, Izzy wins in 2 rounds. Just wish we would have seen that more but congrats to the new champ and I’m so excited for a rematch!!
No need for a rematch he beat u three times its over.
Taking loss like a man 👍👍
Lossers
I'm more of a fan after seeing how he handled this loss than I was before.  He could have dodged this fight and never had to call out Romero. He always wants the toughest challenge  The dude is an all-timer and he can get that belt back before his career ends.
Lmfao bring back Steve!! Only the real ones know . True champ, Class act he will be back!
Rematch is a must!  Otherwise… Khamzat.
Lolol the ground game izzy has is pretty pathetic, kinda like his legacy. Worthless clown
Izzy thinks Gyno surgery is something to be sympathetic on lol
Izzy may have lost to the belt to perara, but he clearly took the pelt from bigfoot!
You were seeing stars izzy dont lie you cry baby and dont come back too new Zealand stay and live in usa and another thing good job you lost because i had a bet you were going too lose haha and i won my bet thanks man for losing
Ridiculously professional . Need more guys like him brining back the martial arts to MMA, the ufc has Removed the respect and integrity of martial arts and made it just a combat sport. It’s refreshing to see a fighter act the way he does even in defeat .
no rematch , its clear you lost in all aspect
The bell saved Alex Pereira in the first round. He could have been badly hurt by Izzy but that's sport.
It lowkey sucks because Izzy’s been on top for so long but I knew this fight could go either way
Classy as always. Still my fave.
Everyone said Alex didn't deserve to be where he is at. Now he has the title. What now
I had a feeling it would happen
Izzy was outclassing that dude. He’s not on his level he’s very fortunate to have that god given power.
How’s he gonna question the stoppage? Dude was staring at the ground looking for loose change
These reporters suck at asking questions  The real question You got knocked out 2x now  Do you really think you're better than him?
He will Never be a UFC Champion again hes Done🤣 There is a New King & that is  Poatan💪 Tell Gaybender to go polish his nail or something😂
Izzy can ko him. He just need to be precise and more aggressive. The inner beast needs to come out. Cuz if there was more time in the first round. It would of been a wrap.
True sportsman. Love & respect to you Izzy
"and he did it...again" damn 🤦🏾‍♂️
I WILL MAKE HIM FIGHT- PEREIRA
Isn't this the dude who ran his mouth while undefeated ? Lol damn everyone tried being Mayweather when he retired.. tough luck buddy..that's 2 losses now.
Bro is yet to credit alex for just being a better fighter then him, dude is nit picking at the “late stoppage” or the leg kicks.. bro alex is just a better combat athlete than you
That jacket is lit
This is how you take a loss man. Respect him even more.
Respect to izzy, this is what this sport is about! Best vs best NO EXCUSES
It’s a thing of all great martial artists there is always that one fighter you can’t beat in Izzy’s case it’s Alex Pereira
You might not like him for his boring fights in the last few years, but you gotta admit the guy has guts, he's a very active fighter and not afraid to fight against anyone.
Respect
Izzy we humble pie. You can feel it in his voice
His 💅nails got clipped by Alex👏
Jesus Christ, How many Fuckin Animals Had TO die fOR That Coat to BE MadE?  LOL
Sting in Pereyra punches to be feared. Look at Izzy's face, not even close to the damage he took in the Gastelum fight. I was distraught that he did not get the W. I wish him the best maybe now he will do better. He now has a true contender. He will overcome Peryra's power and become UFC's champion, although he will always be a champion in life.
Izzy‘s fan since forever. But brooo,wtf…stop wearing that bullshit brother, I feel ashamed for you and you don’t give a rat’s ass about it…think of your fans,we don’t care about loss of the belt. That was bound to happen sooner or later. But the outfit what you present to us..just stop. Please.
Couldnt make it past the final boss ... Alex just has his number.
RESPECTS to Izzy. Took his loss as a man
My respect for Izzy man he put up a good 5 round fight but man 2 min safe play and he would have been champ still
Damn. I thought he had this. Good thing for me I didn't place a bet on him.
You never know what is going on behind the scenes…well said Izzy. God bless ❤
Alex should be in light heavyweight. He like a fighting people smaller than him 🚮
Saved by the bell in that first round, 8 count in kick-boxing and lost a fight he won in the first kick boxing match. Imagine how annoyed you would be if you were Adesanya
Looking at Izzy reminded me of something the late great Muhammad Ali said its hard to get out of a satin sheets bed at 4am and leaving a mansion walking by all your luxury vehicles and go for a run & stay committed like before all of the stuff  Izzy in the fur coat speaks volumes to his lost although he fought a good tactical  fight for 4 rounds it still resulted AND NEW!! congrats to Perera great fight.
Dethroned Izzy is still Izzy. Champ with…or without the belt
"I was fine "😂.
Was literally having an anxiety attack watching this fight
Next fight should be Danny dyer vs Alex
before the fight: I have to win this, after the loss, no big deal.
Lucid??? Man was out on his feet, a shot way from permanent brain damage 🤣 should be thanking the ref for saving his life in there. Talking about if the ref left it go on he would've won a decision lool, yea woulda won a free ride to the hospital, on a stretcher
I really think the UFC needs to adopt a standard of NOT giving a REMATCH when a FINISH has occured in the championship fight!!!  in the last 2-3 years, this rematch business seems to have really gotten out of control.  it totally fucks up the division.  it lead to a trilogy, which is like wtf,, if izzy wins the rematch due to a card call, then what does that say about fighting???  i mean this aint fucking basketball, the reasons for fighting should be centered on first meetings, rather than what can we do to change the game plan to prevent the reason why we lost.  its so fucking stupid imo.  i get the whole hes been a champ for x amount of whatever, but you got finished, you got fucking killed in action,, youre done!  person x is the champ, an you need to earn your way back to the belt
Respect Izzy
His coat haha
izzy was NOT FINE lol.  He was goin out if that shit was left to keep going
i totally respect this guy. Love Izzy
Looks like Alex Knocked the French manicure right off him- perfect!!
The ice trick is just dirty. We all know it. Alex didnt need it.
Izzy still the Champ that sucked he had him out 2 times and just beat him down most the time and got caught it happens knock down get up dust off keep it moving champ hope he takes care of this health since he say somethings going on. Cant wait for the come back
CHAMP ❤
He’s leg was balloon 🎈
He seemed very relieved looks like a heavy load has been lifted from him
Usman and Izzy both fell victim to the circumstances and pressure of being fan pleasing. Now they both lost the belt.. there was zero reason for Izzy or Usman not to grapple and hold a 5th round victory. I have a lot of respect for Izzy for this fight, he was willing to sit in the pocket and eat shots for the fans. He could have easily did the Romero fight all over again.
4:30 clown ass behavior. Dude will never hold the belt again 👍 thank Izzy most people gotta pay 5k for a rack.. you got that shit free 💯
Izzy got frozen like ellsa
I was shocked that he couldn't take him down, but I understand now that  his leg was compromised. I hope ur health issues ur facing get resolved and comeback stronger.
He trying so hard to not act like he just got humbled and bitched 🤣🤣🤣 FUCK IZZY LETS GO NEW CHAMP ALEX
Izzy dominated the whole fight. I saw those pictures of his shin before the fight.
Loved the guy he is so calm
Get rid of that monster water bottle
At least he can’t paint his nails now
It's called "humility". Always right there when it needs to be.
Wow, this man knows how to lose. Inspiring. Was cheering for you Izzy. Looking forward to the rematch.
Alex KO'd Israel from Kickboxing to MMA and now he KO'd him from MMA to...?
Shut up dud u disappoint your fan
" Bring back Steve Mazzagati " 😂🤣
😢 we love you bro still champion
Good job by pereira. Izzy should come back and win the rematch, being more careful and not just stalling and grabbing Alex. He needs to fight.
He got robbed can wait to see the rematch
The Nigerians go down!! as they are having this feeling that they are unbeaten!!
Dont get Izzy's look now. From a humble guy to some pimp outfit. People started loving you for different values man.
Pereira 3 0, end of story boy. Stay in line there are other guys in the league
He will never get that belt back again nice run tho
When its a championship match  let them go out on 🛡.    I feel like it was early stoppage
He wasn't lucid. He got rocked. He was wobbled, crouched down with hands blocking. What would have happened next would not have been a recovery, it would have been a brutal KO. I like Izzy but Alex got him. The ref kept Izzy from taking unneeded damage.
Money and being famous is a weakness to the grind 💯
Alex and his team had a gameplan too. It involved enduring everything Izzy had until the championship rounds. Mainly because they knew Izzys conditioning is WAY better than the previous fights they've had. And just a side note??? Alex's durability is off the charts. But yeah. They waited until the championship rounds, as he wasn't fresh and fit. They waited until his leg was jello. Put on the fence. Beat his brains out. Took that strap. Congratulations Alex. He was always just holding it for you champ.
5 seconds and Alex was done smh
LMAOL WHAT A SORE LOSER HIS LEG HE LOST BECAUSE HIS LEG LMAOL REALLY!!!!!! ALEX HAS POWER AND DETERMINATION MF!!!🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅
Izzy has one advantage over Alex, how elusive he is so saying that backing up on the fence was the only way he loses
Humble. Great fight the 4th will be amazing?
still my champ
Ah ha... Niggas always talkin shyt n git they ass Beat.....jus like wilder.....so Izzy know damn well he kant fuck wit Jon jones....he would've destroyed his ass lmao
Yes you weeb your induced free tittys is just like someone dying quietly to cancer. You are a fuckin clown
Izzy had him in the last of the first round man so close
I was so nervous watching this fight, this is a real rivalry. Knocked him out 3 times
Who tf didn’t know this would be the outcome? 3ls to the same dude. Nail painting weebs this is not the way 🤣 He broken like his tat now 👍 he knew he was losing why the dude was making plans to switch classes, maybe go to belator 👍 this fucking clown  compared dying to cancer to his free titties he got from his steroids. I stg😂🤣
Izzy was reaching for air.....saying "stop it alex" 💅
Look at his face, That is the look of defeat and disappointment!..   HUMBLE PIE... LOL   ROIFLMAO  HAHAH HEHEHEH WOOO HOO!
Personally I’m glad he lost, and I’ll hope for another loss when that day comes.
Nigeria Will Reclaim All Belts 2023  Kamaru and Israel mark my words , will reclaim the thrones 2023 period
strong mentality, no excuses, respect my man
What a furry ending
Fkn hell. The amount of money lost in Vegas last night must’ve been tremendous
The fight was amazing     So high level and was just unreal to watch
Based on the fact that Izzy was whooping him on the ground…. It’s safe to say Alex’s run won’t last long. Either Khamzat, Vettori, or Bobby Knuckles will get him outta there
There is only one that we call “THE FIRST”  , but it’s also a “ Second”  so, as of right now and current in this world is best at 185 lbs is Alex, and Izzy. no one else can beat them.
Hump that Izzy! #HumbleYoAss
germany stopped wanting to win after 2nd wars, izzy still going after the 3rd
All the silly "UFC" fans who know nothing about fighting probably feeling pretty dumb right now huh.. adesanya will NEVER beat pereira, not in kickboxing, mma, or hungry-hungry-hippos
Bro still moving as the champion
You won champ wut a warrior
It was a lucky shot by Alex, Izzy won the fight before the KO. It's like Leon KO Usman when Usman winning the fight. Rematch will be different though they will reclaim it and go for the TRILOGY
Africans literally have the worst fashion styles.
Bruh these refs need training. Let the man lose properly at least. Israel wasn't knocked out and he was doing his stupid no look evading shit. Well he learned his mistake but these refs definitely have ulterior motives.
My leg 🦵 😂😂😂 my head😂😂😂 my arms lol😂😂
He's not hungry no more
"Bring back Steve Mazzagatti" hahahahaha
Izzy coulda kept fighting its bullshit... N that coats badass
“I was fine” couldn’t even raise his hands above his waist 😂😂 bro was sleeping on his feet
After all his boring fights it's good to see someone hungry with the belt
Anyone see Alex coach keep his finger under his nose between the 1st and 2nd round after Izzy almost KO'D him? I've watched mma for years and never seen that before. Seemed like Alex woke up fast after the 1st somehow
The dude had the fight won. He fucked up
I hope he loses in the rematch too. Then he'll be humble. He lost after running his mouth, but still he acts as if he just got caught slipping. Hopefully after a back to back loss, he'll be mature enough for me to find him likable to watch and root for. If not, he can just stay as stupid as he wants, dafuq I care. All the matters now, is Israel lost this fight, fair and square.
And New...... That's what he gets for talking about more money more money...
Time for Francis to lose his belt next lmfao.
What a degenerate
Isreal looks like a wookie with that fur...
This is why I slowly started to root for the other fighter. Izzy wanted no excuses after the fight and now it’s the refs fault he lost. You’ve been an abysmal winner as of late and now a sore loser.
Damn no Izzy haters in the comments no more😂
Love you Izzy, but you were getting knocked out
His attitude to the loss 🦁
Love ya Izzy bro take care of yourself enjoy your family bud great fighter ur a great fighter bro great fight thanks it takes a lot to get in the octagon no matter how many times u step inside there
Izzy 😢
Like what I said in all comments  When I see nervousness in a press conference it’s over  I’m 5/5 in main event betting :D love it
He looked absolutely phenomal this fight Isreal can fight like an anime character but anyone can get knocked the fuck out.
No way he just compared his gyno to Chadwick Boseman’s cancer 😐
So sad as an izzy fan to see this loss
he and periera becoming brothers when they retire and live a normal lifeplay video games and watch animes <3
Where’s all that shit talking?
What's wrong with Izzy scary comparison to Chad Bozeman 😬 is he sick?
Why does he hate monster energy I forgot
Great champion he take his L like a Man thats the fighting game you make 1 mistake and That end for you but he a better fighter than that guy he gotta keep his hands up all the time
I was going for Alex but I do like adesanya however he don’t excite me when I watch him but he goes by opponent and fights off that energy. He knew Alex was gonna bring it so he countered back and I respect him for that. The LOOK AT ME comment will be legendary now after this performance.
He says the right stuff, weather he believes it or not is another story
This guy is a real winer love to you israel
Proof izzy can only fight smaller people. Fuck this steroid cheat
First clear sasquatch video I've ever seen..amazing
This "energy" is dumb af. He looked nervous this time and the guy who beat him twice beat him again. Alex was 6-1 and is champ. Crazy
They taking the belts from our African warriors one at a time! First kamaru now Izzy!
The stoppage was ass. As soon as Izzy squatted against the cage there were 5 unanswered strikes before Goddard stopped it 🤨 out of the 7 strikes Alex threw in the last combo only 5 landed and they weren’t all consecutive. It went miss, land, land, land, miss, land, land. He was still standing and trying to dodge. It makes no sense that Chandler can hit Dustin 5+ times while he’s laying face down.I get it was different refs but how stupid can you be. It’s the inconsistency that’s annoying. Izzy isn’t a 40yr old veteran. Never been KOd prior and the ref stops it that early?? Like what? Just let Izzy recover or get KOd it’s a title fight of a 34yr old whose prime… Goddards logic is non existent.
black men have been getting humbled more often in these rings…not so superhuman after all
What is he wearing…
Dude you were out on your feet 🤣
The fuck is he wearing lmaoooo
Israel  very disappointed in u 2 time loss
He simply needed to avoid him and would've won...it was already in the bag...congrats to Alex and that left hook
Parade around like ya boy Ngannou?
wrestle heavy fighters like Vettori are chomping at the bit
He knocked Alex out!
Izzy should let Costa go wrestlefuck Alex and then knock out Costa again for the belt
I didn't love or hate the stoppage. It honestly might've saved Izzy when they fight again. Sometimes those KO punches changes your career forever and he's not getting any younger.
Last style bender will return Trust me
Adesanya is a loser and a fraud he talks a lot but when it comes to fighting he just likes to run like a coward.
"Loosing was so nice 👌🏻 I had to try it thrice!" - Anthony "the roadman" Joshua 🤣
How can anyone not respect this guy? Looking forward to when Izzy inevitably wins the belt back! Respect to Pereria as well!
Props to Izzy for showing up. I would say I really enjoyed seeing this guy get humbled by Alex last night - but it's clear he has not been humbled. Maybe losing the rematch will do the job. But he will likely just come out to that post-fight presser with an even bigger fur coat on.
pure class even in defeat, won’t be long before he’s back up to bat for the title
Greatness personified! Great performance! You are a champion. Always willing to put it on the line! Rest up , enjoy life, then go get that fucking belt back!!!
I called Alex winning this one because I knew they would stand up because Izzy wanted that. Had Izzy done more wrestling and got more takedowns he would have won. He was exhausting Alex on the ground and having success keeping him there. Alex hasn’t had enough time to really prepare for the elite grapplers. There’s a lot of guys who watched this fight and are more confident now because of it. Both fighters had weaknesses exposed.
Bigfoot sighting
Izzy da goat.
Humble in defeat, love to see it. Keepnit easy Champ
Man I believe Izzy knew Pereira would go all out the last round but I don't think he expected him to have that much left in his tank. Respect to Izzy congratulations Pereira!
I really hope that Adesanya and Usman never win again. I am so tired of seeing that ugly Nigerian shithole flag. Both of these guys owe their success to western nations but continue to tout their shithole country of birth. At least they were born there. Cain Velasquez was even worse. He was born in the USA, reaped all the benefits of this great nation, and he represented Mexico. The guy didn't even speak Spanish. Black and brown are so racist. White people are so accepting and loving. Facts.
Izzy is way more grateful then a Floyd may weather or many of the other champs in the world I have to say. He can be cocky and rub off wrong to me but at the end of the day he was and is champ and in defeat he is not making many excuses and he is accepting the man has beat him 3 times at that point you just have to accept it to this point and try again. This gives me much more respect for Izzy in seeing him be respectful and grateful in defeat. I can’t wait to see the rematch. I’m now much more of a Izzy fan as before I really wasn’t to be honest. Maybe next I can root for Izzy
He removed the drink. I think he did not get paid for that one or he is trying to be Ronaldo.
Pereira loses his first title defense if it’s against someone who knows how to grapple.
He's taken on all comers. Close fight. Definitely deserves an immediate rematch
Say what you will, Izzy is pretty boring,  ur he loses like a man, massive respect fo taking it so well.
Honestly if Izzy beat the dude right now, it wouldn't be as big as it will be.
It sure was a horror film for you boy glad you got smoked
Great fight bt looking like a monkey here.  🤣
Izzy and usman got way more fans from losing then winning they are fantastic fighters
I just love Israel, I hope he will keep on going.
Finally Izzy gets to stop thinking he's invincible
Dude says he was fine but his head looked like the little monster from dead space with how badly it was bobbing around.  He wasn’t even looking at pereira, dude was looking at the mat, and his hands couldn’t even get a grip on anything, but he was “fine and lucid”
Much respect to Adesanya for handling the loss like a G
It was actually crazy sight to see. Never seen him being back up and wrapping to relieve the pressure the entire fight. And at the end he got rocked, tried to hug and got peace’s the fuck up. Crazy fight love them both.
I feel they stopped it too early...let him go to sleep
Is that a dead animal jacket?
swallowing a bitter pill after trashtalking pereira
Izzy’s the real winner! Pereira said first to shoot is the pu$$¥! He shot first!
what the fuck are you wearing dude.....
Alex is Izzy's kryptonite
My only question is how is it okay that Alex blew up that big at the fight? He had to be close to 215ish he looked huge compared to Izzy... just a question
Hey kids, there is a lot to learn from this man mentality. It's unbelievable
Respect for Izzy
He looks like a dragqueen 😅
You looked scared before the fight....
So rigged wow
Haha, he dresses like a woman. Poor creature   😅🤣😂
Major respect for Izzy! A true champ is gracious in victory and in defeat. This man is still a champ. He doesn’t duck anyone and as a fan of combat sports this is rare. Izzy was up on the scorecards but it only takes 1 punch. I have more respect for you champ at how you conducted yourself in defeat.
I respect that he went toe to toe and didn't run or dance but they stopped it exactly when they needed to. He was not looking ok
Izzy got frozen like Elsa 😂😂😂 fuckin nerd better luck next time
I'll never say a bad word about Adesanya again, all the respect.
Actually this was one of adesanya best performances and without a Alex P to push Izzy there is no one else left to really challenge him. So sometimes the champ has to lose: Ali and mike Tyson the greatest ever both faced loses. Nothing but a peanut.
Seriously don’t know why are people hating on him. He’s done nothing but good for the sport. Thank you for entertaining us champ. Work on your ground game and come back with vengeance. Join khabibs camp if you have to.
For a guy who just lost his world title he looks so relaxed 😢😢 The Problem is he lost to the same guy that hv beaten him before. I hope this doesn’t look end up like Silva vs Weldman 😮😮😮 . I am so upset 😮😮😮how can we lost two champions under one year 😢
first Usman now Izzy, Franciss next?
it was a good fight
he was in the nosebleeds then they made his nose bleed
It's the drake curse that caused him to lose
What an interesting man he is . Just a good guy , so much to respect in him .
Izzy SUCKS, OVERRATED!!.....if you made it this far- I'm kidding, great fight Izzy looked good but tripped up at the end
Definitely top on the list of people I would love to meet
That was a sick a** fight. Not a dull moment
Sadly the ufc might not grant the 4th fight !
Keeping the same energy by getting rid of the Monster logo
Alex is a real man a real Champion Israel has some growing up to do he acts like a little boy!!
Everyone talkin all this respect for him cause of this interview,, of course his ass is humble
I had a feeling. He chin never gets tested because he’s usually the longer and taller fighter. Alex is a big boy. He stays very upright like a kickboxer. His strikes seems awkward but the dude has real power. If he strings a few together, you’re in trouble.
Man is out here looking like a silver back in that coat
His ass got humbled
True Champion humble in defeat🏆. " I put that shit on the line and shit happens". What happened? " The calf kick! "
Respect to Izzy man, it’s clear he’s more skilled than Alex, but Alex got that punch
All of you flipping sides and talking good about him after he loses is sad. Everything used to be flooded with hate comments and now it’s all happy and respectful. Crazyyy
Huge fan of izzy ! But fuk bruv this fight just had left hook written all over the fight u no ? He was lookin for it and found it ! Be blessed champ get bk to the title contention
I thought izzy was gonna start taking him down after the success with the takedown he had . Held him down the whole round
4:20 Hmmmm, is it me or is Izzy planting seeds of excuses already? Trust me dude, you’re no Chadwick Boseman
What a guy 🙌
Excuses excuses for this steroid titty cheat. L
Israel is a boring champ but he was not a sore loser. If at all this loss makes me respect him more.
I'm sorry to say, but after what I saw in the ground I can't help but thing Khanzat Chimaev win wipe both of them out.
Love that he says he dared to be great when he had all the advantages vs a fighter who had a huge weight cut a fighter who has only 4mma fight
Got me a while to get used to the coat but yes, that was a real fight and Izzy doesn't dodge anyone... respect.
What a hero I will always remember seeing him at the empire state building even though I was scared to ask for a picture.... I still think he is a huge hero
I’m not an Izzy fan but he seemed to be intelligently and coherently defending himself well when the ref stopped the fight
Props to Izzy for taking the L like a champ
He got cocky and wanted to show he could take the hits and then found out he couldnt
What a b!@#$ I was lucid, no you got KTFO. That why I cant stand this dude, he has no humility.
Bad stop
Comparing himself to someone who had cancer... so is the titty cancer or...? How dare the public speculate when you provide zero information, that never happens!
I wanted Alex to win and Izzy made that very fucking stressful, he fought a great fight and looked untouchable in moments
winning the whole fight i was like what are you doing my boi back in the fence
This title is WIDE open now. Alex has a ton of holes
I think that it would’ve been different if they let it go on for a few more seconds. If Alex kept at it and just slept him for real, most people don’t come back from a bad KO.
😢
Humble Izzy is a version I can appreciate
Go paint your nails n buy a new choker or a pearl necklace, we all know that will make YOU feel better izzy
At least he's got that big jacket to keep him warm
Looks like the tiny head guy from Beetlejuice
I would favor almost every man in the topover the new MW champ.
If he makes it boring the last round he is still champion
He don’t got much to say now. Thought he had the best fight iq in the fight game lol. Can’t wait to see his video with his little blanky reacting to this lol he’ll be a commentator soon
I kept cringing and holding my breath every time Pereira would get Izzy along the fence. It was just a matter of time after a while.
UGHH this doesn't feel right. This sucks. Izzys the man. Hate this
To to have a proper wrestling camp
Ghat interview must have been so hard
The bigger stronger fighter won... 4th fight same result
Izzy called periera out gave him the opportunity even though he could’ve fought anyone else and made pereira fight couple more time in ufc
He sucks 😂😂
The dude fights everyone, so active, gives us super fights, never misses weight or any extra bullshit, dude has done things in the combat world only a handful could do.
Super dangerous on the ground 😂
Lame coat hahaha
🤣
Alex is big and his hands look the size of Izzys head, we all built different and Alex is a tough son of a bitch that hurts even when you hit him lol
No titles rematch for you when this guy's the champion. This guy is not just an ordinary Champion but he's the guy that beat you twice
Izzy ate the humble pie he needed.  AGAIN. He put up a great fight however. All respect to Izzy. He has class.
Whilst MMA is a huge sport, and the UFC have done an amazing job at creating the massive attraction that it quite rightly has around the world,  I do think that this fight quite clearly displays the significant gap between ‘Grapplers’ & ‘Strikers’ in terms of which is the dominant martial art when it comes to who ultimately reigns supreme on this platform, and not much has really changed from when Royce Gracie appeared at the very beginning and subdued fighters who appeared to be monsters in every sense of the word whilst physically not really presenting a presence not that much more intimidating than a normal guy off the street!!! Equally you could refer to khabib’s domination in more recent times and likely that of his student Islam Makhachev who is likely to achieve the same success and that is MMA is really a platform for Wrestling / Grappling and that when a world class one comes along they dominate and all other martial arts do not really come close.  Yes you will have periods where weight classes consist mainly of strikers, kick boxers etc, and some of them we appear to be almost superhuman when they wipe the floor with other less skilled strikers but as soon as they encounter a grappler of a certain level the likelihood is that they will struggle, really this Platform is the Ultimate Grappling Championship…    Israel Adesanya has been looked upon as almost some sort of celestial level of fighter in the possession of superhuman levels of fighting ability however really he is a striker of a certain level and Alex Pereira, who has proven to be his superior a number of times, is a better one!!! he has Israel’s number and anyone who was surprised by this result has likely allowed themselves to be pulled into the hype and got carried away as in all honestly there are no UFC fighters who have proven to be strikers of any real merit and its unlikely that there will ever be, you’ve only got to look at how they do against boxers (even retired ones or You-Tube personality ones) to confirm this!!!! They look good against each other, and you wouldn’t want to mess with them, but really UFC is only ever going to validate who is the best Ju Jitsu / Grappler / Wrestler as all of the other disciplines that they showcase will never be anywhere near the striking ability of Boxing, which in its purest form,  will always prove to be superior in terms of its pugilistic prowess and its champions who time and history will continue to confirm had a natural, god given talent for striking in terms of instinct, movement, speed, coordination and who’s inclusion within a credible ‘hall of fame’ will continue to validate as the difference between the two sports, not saying one is better than the other as they’re both extremely exciting to watch but don’t get carried away with how good you think these guys are, you've only got to look at the hype with Michael Chandler and he's one of many.    Israel Adesanya Vs Alex Pereirathis really just demonstrated two average strikers,  one more competant than the other and who has proven to be so many times before!! at some point a world class grappler will appear on the horizon and there will be another champion and another and another......  For a less dangerous pastime you should join us @MowambiMonopoly for a game of monopoly!!!!
Did Izzy really just compare himself to a guy that had cancer?  Does he have cancer?
He said dare to be great too back when he lost to jan blachowicz
Respect he handled that perfect True champion no excuses 🙏
The most likable I've seen this guy.
I knew it was going to happen again. Alex was stalking this nicca the whole fight just waiting lol. U can tell Izzy is hurt… he’s goated but he needs to get stronger.
Well well. Alex is becoming a nightmare for izzy.
Izzy always thinks and has the mindset of a champion That will not change, and that will take him back to the top. The best question is:  Why didn't he just get on his bike, and play defense for the final round.  Looks like he failed an IQ test.  He had it!😮‍💨
Like Izzy here.
You’re the greatest Adesanya. We’re all rooting for you and can’t wait for your return
LUDO!!!
His leg caused the  knockout on the chin I guess
5:43 He Don’t Want Nomore Smoke 😂😂😂😂😂 3-0 Alex 👑
Awww poory Izzy got breast cancer?  Couldn't run the entire fight and circle outbso now he's got to make excuses for losing, he's lucky the ref stopped it before Alex threw a knee to that low hanging head! Izz even grappled and clinched up cuz he was scared. Izzy fan boys please cope below
He’s fucked lol
DC didn't call Izzy's takedown attempts actual "attempts" until his 3rd try. As soon as Pereira made a takedown, DC made fun of the way he got it and laughed at him in the middle of the Match.  Jabs from Izzy were "beautiful" to DC. Punches that snapped Izzy's head back were just "a good one".  It's like you can tell when the commentators are building up one side to help support a decision. I'm glad it didn't work out for them.
Cringefest.....he thinks he is the main character... thank God gynosanya got knocked out. can't stand his 12 year old cartoon lovers fans
Nice one Izzi we got your back man Avery business man and champ would agree with me that there are ups and downs in everything we do, this is one of them, I mean Izzi is a champ you can see that from the fight.
His team lied to him at the store. His head is too small for that jacket.
Dude was every bit of 210-220 LBS
Swallow that bitter humble pie you clown 🤣
“Theres something special about my people”. you thought 😂
LOL. Israel "the humble" Adesanya. He tries to convince you he won after a loss. Basically says Pereira was lucky. Zero humility. Only excuses. This is what happens when he is forced to fight. 3-0 period.
Glad he got that ass whooped!
Lucky the ref stopped it‼️ Before he got knockedouT🤡
Alex periera is the best and he's better than the clown Izzy even if he give the clown rematch he don't have any chance is better for the clown Izzy to find short guy because Alex periera is another level
That was his last good chance to get a win over him now. Alex will get some ground game and then it will be over
I get that y’all wanna give Izzy his flowers but….. why? The best thing he did was wobble him in the first round. After that it was getting backed into a corner, & the weakest grabbing I’ve ever seen in my life. For the third time fighting a guy, you’d think he would have it down.
"I was still there id still be champion" meanwhile he look like he's doing the hoolahoop dance
PETA is gonna lose their sh*t
You could see that when Izzy kicked Alex and his leg gave out then Izzy trying to move away along the fence and his leg gave out again but Izzy is rightfully F gutted.Alex is a BEAST and I'm glad he won crazy fight and how big was Alex holy shit congrats if you make the weight and can rehydrate like that then cudos. Brazil 🇧🇷
Now everyone will be sucking Alex nuts. All these fake ass UFC fans will come out and  say how great Alex is when he’s really not that great. Izzy or someone else will beat Alex. He won’t be champion long.
These reporters are straight idiots all the time asking stupid questions.
Herb Dean shoulda been The Ref . He wouldn’t have stopped the fight 😂
Dana White just got richer and threw Izzy and Alex some scraps off his giant table.  FUCK THE UFC! CORRUPT ORGANIZATION
Your are great
Dude lost 3 times to alex but is still talking about the rematch.  Just give up adesanya please
I'd like to offer some perspective to the common fan. You prob wonder how he can get up there and answer questions after losing? You prob feel bad for him ? One of the traits martial Arts gives to a human, is the ability to be humble. From the first day you walk into a gym, dojo, school, you are taught, losing is part of the bigger journey. If you lose and act like a bitch, you aren't evolving as a human. It's a perk of martial Arts training. Some of you can't believe he can cope with this loss. Some of you are in disbelief! I assure you now and forever, he's lost many many many times before and he has acquired the quality of humble within his soul. All while being able to walk around, knowing that he has learned something the common man has not. Knowing how to lose. Many of us suffer from ego. When you train martial Arts, your ego dies and is essentially,                 " REBORN". SO just know, anytime you meet a person that trains martial Arts, they all have this quality. Even Conor McGregor
Do you guys realise that all of this happened just because an old interview Israel gave back in the day? Talking about Pereira, he said that now he (Izzy) was at the top  of the world and that Alex would only watch him through the television is some random bar, then comment with his friends that one day he (Alex) had knocked out that guy, then he would carry on being a nobody.   Alex was comfortable being champion at Glory and only decided to transition to MMA because of that interview... This is insane!
He looks like a gelada in that coat.
You were not fine
I watched Pereira knock this man out for 10 minutes in a row. Whittaker beat him last time anyway and I am happy Pereira didn't let it go to the cards. He will never be humble or likeable, look at that coat bro.
I dislike him more, when he wins as a champ at press conference he wont shut up. When he loses he cuts it short and gives bad answers.
Got froze like Elsa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chewie!
Best card of the year hands down but in the conversation for best of all time. The 3 main fights all delivered. Even boring. ass Esparza was scrambling and entertaining which was a surprise.
Proud of you champ ❤️🙏
Can wait to see Pereira beat him three times.
Congratulations champ u done alot be proud of yourself
Where's all the " he a black man so  he he gonna win " talk ???
He needs to get a DUTCH kickboxing trainer need to learn combos he needs too. All that scared defensive fighting does not always work yo combos does. Right left then a including low or high kick i know he can do it he has the skills
It seems that after one roast and emotional damage He removed His “gay tips”
He has a great attitude, l love that he's not letting this get him down.
Dude is still a boss!! 👏👏👏
Very poised and well spoken he is.
Izzy was extremely nervous this fight and looked scared to follow through with his punches
adesanya é gigante. lutou muito ontem
Im not suprised at all alex got his number
That fur is awful.  If he had just pressed the action to try to get him out of there he might have won.  But he was just trying to get out of the 5th with minimal engagement.
He looked nervous in yhe octagon
The real champion
His legs f##ked, leg is no joke can mess up the rhythm, but ain't complaining, going back to the drawing board and come back stronger
All respect to Adesanya
IZZY is right the ref should have let Alex completely put him to sleep
izzy needs to stop acting like a women to be able to beat this pereira guy . At least he didnt come with those strange nails .
Don't really know dude but seeing the first minute.. Shows character.
What a loser, three losses against Pereira and still can't say Alex is just the superior fighter. Asslasagna was put on skates and frozen like Elsa.
He defeat 3times to Alex
Even after he beats Alex he beat him 3 times. If he beats him a fourth that is going to suck.
Izzy now look ready for heavyweight
Can't watch the fight yet but was he winning till the stoppage?
If he lose again tho that’s it we don’t need a another one
That was no where near his best performance wtf this guy asking
HUGE respect to Izzy....Alex is a legit LIGHT HW! The size difference was crazy!
The ref stopped him from kicking his ass when he was dazed. This fight was bull shit.
Dude you can't beat da man plain and simple
It is weird how he never  Has anything to do after his victories.
I love Izzy, I don’t care if he wins or losses honestly he’s a winner in my eyes either way
Wish Izzy the best and a speedy recovery. Crazy cars last night, props to all the fighters who put their lives on the line!!!
Israel, is a crazy guy🤣🤣🤣, really wished he beat Pereira this time but damn😤
Can we take a moment to appreciate the removal of the monster bottle
Gracious in his loss. Many should learn.
This fight sucked they played footsies horrible wrestling and grappling izzy couldn’t even throw legs in and they barely threw any punches  I’m laughing at everyone like this was the greatest izzy fight are you stupid  what why because he fought slightly more the usual
A true champ.
So much for Alex going to gas out and not be able to hang with the 5 round fight!
I'm a fan of both fighters Alex is a newbie in ufc and KO hin for the 3rd times I believe even with a rematch adesanya will not have a chance against Alex
Pretty much just like the usman fight . But he actually got knocked out lol
It's still "his story" I guess
Excuses… excuses….  Hard to swallow that humble pie ain’t it? 😂🤡
So much respect for Izzy facing the “boogie-man” head on like he did 👊🏽 was a master class till the KO. I can’t wait for the rematch 🙌🏽
Nah Izzy u not putting shit om the line is your Job u fighting to make more money stop byllshit the people man
Suga can take a note from this legend on how to be humble in defeat. Nothing but respect to the Last Transgender! 💯
Wow Izzy has breast cancer! Crazy
If the eyes roll backwards your not in it bro
Adesanya after his fight with Blachowicz is not the same, but he still holds an impressive record and has a great legacy.
The fight was so intense.. I was standing in the middle of my living room entire fight along with my 5 year old daughter… great fight.. Izzy was the better fighter until the power got him
"I got some shi+ to do" he'll probably get back to the gym and practice his next strategy coz he already figured it out
This man is so humble. much respect Champ!
Damn that’s a really nice fur
Damn; the pain! Such a crazy amazing character and personnality and yet... The quiet and abnormally powerful  endgame boss is still there. That's crazy.  I don't even think Izzy can beat Perreira in the rematch and to be honnest; even if he does it will not mean much...  Perreira is just that good. I'd say he is one of or the best kickboxer in the world and probably one of the best  striker in the world.  The lesson here is: There is always someone better than you. The only weakness I see in Perreira is his lack of wrestling/ stylebending. Present him with an elite grappler as heavy and strong as him and he is over. But who can do that in his weightcategory? Khamzat maybe but he is not strong/ powerful/massive enough comparee to Perreira who is built like a tank. But yeah bring someone as massive as Perreira and with both striking AND good wrestling ane he might have a chance... untill then; I really don't see many people able to compete with a two division weight kickboxing world champion in his prime.
Nice coat chimp.....  I dont care how good he is this guys a tool period.
Izzy looking like a yeti…
Pity he flaunts animal cruelty in his loss.  You can take the man out of Africa but you can’t take Africa out of.... etc.
Izzy Had this Fight, The Stupid A$$ Ref stopped it to soon.
Izzy will win the next one. Now he got nothing lose .
So glad Alex beat you AGAIN!
Whittaker was right... He ain't as good as he thinks he is. There is levels to this and he ain't on Jon Jones level
Yeah I agree with izzy. It was an early stoppage.
Hope that's not real fur, disgusting
Fair play to pereira, mother fuckers like the terminator. Feel for adesanya though, genuinely seems like the more skilled and talented fighter. Alex just seems to have his number.
Funny game - some of the better ground specialists in the middle weight division will be chomping at the bit to take Alex on for the title as its clear his wrestling and TD defence is shite.
What is he wearing 😅😅!?
Wookie
Atleast he didnt get knockwd out as his brother usman. Respect
I couldn't be more happy to see him get slapped around. Great fighter ,extremely cocky , full of himself and acts like lady gaga.
Guess he got frozen like Elsa
Why izzy dressed up like bigfoot?
whats he wearing? a lion?
Full class and confidence
I have health issues in the chest,it's called steroids
Alex won’t have a chance in the rematch, this is all part of Izzy’s legacy. ✍🏼
Respect
It’s evident that he is bothered by getting knocked TF out YET again
He's still cocky and very unfunny
that goat is goofy as he is 😅
If they fight 100 times Alex wins 100 times
This guy is a true professional!
What a fight 👏🏿
Alex is  Adesanya's achilles heel
I'd still be champion if he wasn't stopped,lol,he'd be dead
Izzy is it real champion may God bless him
Izzy’s ego is wild. This stoppage was the best possible outcome to save him from an embarrassing KO. His arms were flailing around and he had no clue where he was with 3 minutes left in the round
Trains with lights and tennis balls. Then loses. This not a anime show. Dragon Ball lmao. You lost bro. That wasnt a war.
Respect Izzy ! Dudes one of the best to do it and has the best attitude !
Ur were not fine 8zzy
Like the blachofight. Humble in defeat. The loss against Jan didn't affect him at all and I can see izzy continuing after this one too.
I think that guy has just got his number" everyone has a plan until they get smashed in the face :)
Boy was on the defensive with his back against the fence the entire fight
Izzy class act, humble in defeat, he will be back 👏👏👏
Respect
Dude swears to much..So annoying.
Adesany fights very often unlike other "champions" Big respect for Adesanya. But MW needed this turnaround with this rivalry between him and Pereira.
EVERY TIME HE TALKS ABOUT PEREIRA HE BURPS...
Wow he said what I said on the fight video
Still couldn’t think straight, unlucky buddy. Actually fought for once and lost, keep running my g
nope you ain't dangerous on the ground ,ya gat alot to learn .
“Bring back Steve” 😂
Izzy great champion complete asset to the ufc
Is it still considered a “rivalry” if you lose 3-0?
My leg was a balloon
A lot of respect how he carry’s himself after a 3rd loss against this guy. That’s what makes him a champ
Feels like Izzy won all 3 fights against Pereira but lost the final result... Sad He lost the belt.
You losse 🤣
I'm grateful I got to watch you lose Israel. That was my favorite thing, and I hope you never win another fight 😂😂
No champs fight at this rate with the belt
Is this the 3rd time that he beat Adesanya??? I heard Adesanya go "I fucking hate that guy" at the end of the fight.
I m love with your costume..... Izzy where did you get??
Bro was not fine if it would of keep going it would of been worst
Glad Alex won, happy to see Izzy sense of humor and spirit. Would love to see a 4th fight.
Early stoppage.  Ref should have let him fight.  He was still good.  Can’t stand Izzy.  Let’s see if this humbles him… a little bit.  All that said, he had most of the fight and he displayed so much grappling and take down technique.  It’s clear why he’s the best.
My man looks like 🙉
Izzy kept going to the fence!! . This was one of his greatest fights! , but IQ is key ! . You don’t play the fence with a heavy puncher! Especially not in the final last round.! When you do that , the opponent doesn’t have to measure their distance , the fence gives them the measurements and with a fighter aiming to knock you out, your giving them an advantage. I’m just so disappointed cause I wanted Izzy to win so bad and he was so close.
Man’s wearing a lion
Izzy lose his confident 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ he could’ve won but he was  nervous asf
🤫🤭
Imagine they go to Brazil and he beat him there. This would be the sweetest victory for Ady
You weren't fine.... You were out on your feet...
Hahahahahahahahaha
He was not fine lol he was basically out crouched over.
You can tell izzy is not as good as he was in this fight. Maybe the pressure from the previous 2 loss. I actually though he was winning untill the 5th round. Pereira got good recovery and looks in wayy better shape than izzy is. This fight is literally the best middle weight matchup ever.
Issy one of my favorite fighters he mentally strong nd physically talented, this tough to see but I kno he'll bounce back
It is nice to see izzy get humbled.
he looks around from a bear's ass
Izzy memorised the words he's saying to the press!!!!!! Izzy is hurting like shit!!!!🏹🏹🏹
He walks with honour ...still cool in defeat.
Get humble punk😉
Man, the amount of time fighters has to shine in the UFC is so short.
how many foxes killed for that  coth  niga ?
Izzy Weili 👊🏿💪🏿
Still no sign of humbleness or even taking accountability. This guy has had his peak.
Pereira just has his number....Adesanya had a great fight but I always knew it was a matter of time..
Eat that !!!! Go cry !!!
He over there looking like the jack links Bigfoot
Why’s he in a bear costume?😂
Ahh man. I like Izzy now.
Imagine losing the belt and then wearing this
HE WILL BE BACK
Man vs manicure
Backstage: “I know I lost but I still really want to wear the coat!”  Coats aside respect to Issy for taking that like a Champ. Great fight!
Congrats to Alex but I don’t see him winning a rematch. Izzy is far to technical and smart he learned so much from this fight and it’s clear Alex doesn’t have much but power. Izzy will be back.
Best fight of the year! Credit to Alex! Rematch for sure!
I just hope he is okay ,making reference to Chadwick makes me worried.
What a performance He was on top and got caught Still a great still be back Adds to his legacy,  Respect AP
That's a bad stoppage izzy was literally ducking and it means he's still not out, but we can't blame the ref he's just doing his Job.
Izzies fine, great champion he will be back.
Impressive answers... It doesn't mean that I am not happy for his lost.
He’s a legend
Does anyone know the health issue he was alluding to?
PATHETIC coat Dizzy Izzy is wearing. What a piece of shit of a human being. I'm so happy he got knocked the fuck out.
Alex looked so big, and scary lol..The whole fight i was thinking oi man 'Get out of there Izzy"  Alex is a tough mfer. Its nice to see Izzy's mental toughness.
Yo, is Izzy implying that he has breast cancer or gyno??? Because that is very, very different. Why did he explain it like that???
crazy that after a loss im walking away saying izzy looked rlly good in that and almost finished alex
Respectfully, my job matters, not yours, great boy Izzy!
😂😂😂😂😂 anyone wearing fur deserves to get knocked out. 🤡
Pereria did it for the third time. The fake fight calling was ridiculous trying to hype Adesanya every move. The two illegal punches after the bell of round one were all that ever hurt Alex. Adesanya looked desperate grappling and the inevitable occurred in 5. Alex will knock him out faster next time. Adesanya should chase his real dream and go be a trans model until Pereria moves to LHW.
Somewhere in the jungle there’s a bald orangutan
Sorry buddy if the ref didn't stop it, you would've been more beat up hahaha you were getting humbled hahaha you were not fine my guy hahaha
Rematch? So he can try and win 3 coast 2 only to get smashed again ? I’m cool if he goes and humbles himself alittle and comes back to actually fight
I feel like Izzy either takes the belt back from him in a rematch or someone else takes it from Alex and Izzy takes it from them
What a ridiculous coat dude
What a dumbass ….could have won but played with him in the fence and got fucked
What a guy, here´s something to be learned... Humble and staying positive, seeing the positives also in loss. Hat´s off to Izzy! He will be back!
He knew going in he couldn't beat him but had no choice but to fight him. Great fighter but he was not OK and he can't beat him thats 3 in a row no need for a rematch he can't win
IT'S CRAZY THAT IF ADESANYE USED A LIL MORE POWER HE WOULDA FINISHED ALEX IN ROUND ONE WALK OFF KO
Man Izzy is a sniper, I think he can get it done if they do the rematch
He want to wresle him and take bigger guy down like dc kkkkk
That stoppage was kinda… I don’t know man
That coat is FIRE. Izzy will be back. Alex got saved by the bell in the first. Izzy needs to stay out of the fence lines it's no man's land once you are between fence and opponent. Alex did great cutting him off the entire fight.
Izzy would come back stronger ....he was challenged by a formidable fighter and lost....no shame in that
Don't turn in a McGregor .
You wasted your time if you train hard on the clinch work. Wasting your time goof
you didn't put anything on the line. You weren't throwing anymore shots than needed as always. The OHTER GUY put it on the line and he won !
Lol...his bully beat him again
Israel seems to be a really great guy.
I Love Izzy but that was necessary for the division. He had beaten everybody at the top and proved that Rob,Marvin,Costa and Jared cannot compete with him. Now, with Alex as the champion, all these previous name become immediete contenders and the division is alive once again. Vettori especially should be extremely happy because he cannot beat Izzy and Rob but i can see him easily wrestlefucking Alex for 5 rounds in a snoozfest decision. Costa, with his great grappling that he showcased against Rockhold becomes a viable contender as well.
That Chewbacca mink tho
early fucking stoppage bro
Izzy just dropped from my top 3 to number 4..he was scared to get knocked out
Izzy looks like an African boosie gat dayumn that boy ugly 😂
thanks Pereira making Andesanya humble
Hahaha israel Will never win over Alex! Just understand that you not the king anymore….
Frozen like Elza 🥶
This goof practiced his loosing speech
Great interview and classy in defeat. But wtf is with that jacket? How many animals were brutally murdered for that? Come on, man...  I wanna be a fan, but supporting stuff like that is so fucked up 😥
He need to learn jujitsu!
Yes.. so happy he’s not the champ now.. cocky weird muppet!
Hit that man so hard he gave up humanity and became a wookie
Losing his fight and then coming out in that coat
One of the biggest chokes of all time had the fight won 3 rounds to 2 but decides to trade with someone clearly stronger and over 200lbs like smh just destroyed his own legacy in last 2 mins first black panther, then usman, now izzy!! Hide yo kings Jon Jones coming to dethrone the final one just saying.
crazy how many mfs meat riding alex now😂
Glad he lost. All that cockiness acting like his hits didn't mean anything
Alex left Izzy frozen like Elsa 🥶
Izzy said he knew a big secret I guess the big secret was he was gonna lose 😂
Izzy did pretty well in this fight. He did not crumble under pressure.
Bottom line Izzy was scared to get knocked out, thats why he always clinched. Then he got caught and hes fear kicked in
I bet on Alex and had him winning...   Now I feel bad. Damn.
I was fine? No! You were done
Do you guys see how he hides the monster logo water then someone passes him a “aquafina” then they remove the brand? That’s because they are not sponsoring that brand & “monster” is but he lost and he is not the champ no more so monster cut the check lower & he ain’t like that
Imagine if Izzy did the last seconds of 1st round 2 minutes earlier. DAMN!
he is arrogant
Not in fake Wakanda now muppet
Can anyone talk about how Izzy almost finished him at the end of the 1st and Pereira was saved by the bell... not knocking Pereira but give credit where it's due.
Dude you were getting fucked in the 5th  you weren't defending when he was throwing those bombs. Good fight but no excuses. Same with the cancer bs you just said.
Losing the belt doesn't take away the champ mentality. Love it
Izzy the lion of the ring  respect 🙏 👏 🙌 ♥️ 👌
Definitely a close fight for sure. I think a rematch is 100% worth running it back. Although I think the outcome will be the same, but it's definitely worth running it back.
he lost, but everybody saw who the better man was, shit happens🤷
His attitude makes the loss a bit easier to take.
IZZY is a fucking animal killer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (his coat......)
How many animals died for your coat? Good for you losing this fight! Where is the nail polish?
He planned to wear that coat talking bout winning the fight. Lol. Oh well bro. 0-3 it is. Give proper respect tho and say his name. Ur still caught up in ur ego.
It would be a tragedy if Israel was fighting cancer and i'm here thinking he's taking steroids and therefore has a gyno.
He was usually the Predator and better striker but his lack of head movement and defense caught up to him. But don’t worry Perreira won’t be champ long; his utter lack of wrestling defense like Mr. Brittle legs will pave the way for better wrestlers to take the belt. Oh it’s true, it’s true!
Respect he takes the monster can off every time. Very humble man
Round 1 Izzy ALMOST PUT HOM OUT , Alex was saved by the 🔔
Get that jacket off pinhead.🙄
Iggy’s energy was different with this guy. He seemed very concerned from jump. Pereira just has his number 🤷🏽‍♂️
Yea gyno is a huge medical condition
Izzy looks like he took off mask from ginger gorilla suit
Issy got Frozen like Elsa 😂😂😂 Big up Alex p
Save animal😭😭😭 cancel adesanaya 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Yo respect because it’s true he did put it on the line you won’t see that often ESPECIALLY in boxing 🤣
Grande izzy vero campione.
Izzy rode the tiger for a while
Didn't forgot to put the monster down 🤣🤣🤣
Cry... I don't care!!! hahahahaha
Excuses for a loss sound better when it’s not the third time.
3 time Alex beat you And you asking for a number 4 ?🤔
Love it! marxist fooking loser. hope he never wins again, or at least never attempts to bore us to death, while not losing.
Humbled, not so arrogant now is he.
I love to watched their fight again and again.🤪🤪🤪
I think this is his exit ... he's not the same anymore.
He might be fine with the ref stoppage but i am not.
Yeah,  stay positive when life puts you in a difficult situation,  love the spirit.   I thought Izzy when he was winning was all anime stuff and all that , but this guy is graceful upon defeat as well.
He was terrified of pereira. I wouldn’t be surprised if he takes some time off before the rematch
Hahahahah i like
Frankly speaking sir Israel you weee my bet and I had no regret uou had jim in the 4th and almost knocked him out..he wobbled by those hooks but was saved by the bell..so I believed it's not over yet..and I am sure you will soon knocked him out
Bro your team sucks stfu and once volk gets dominated you guys will be finished
Rematch you Will win
Izzy needs to beat him 4 times now to really beat him...
Bro he would of killed you lol stop it ..good stoppage but we understand you’re a warrior
Imagine dominating a division for years, just to get stopped on the feet in championship while you're still there and trying to avoid the onslaught. I'd be livid. When was the last time a championship bout ended with both fighters still standing and moving?
I hope this guy healthy.  Reading between the lines shows he has some medical issues
Still boastful adesanya,even it was very clear that he lost his control 🤣🤣🤣
No Bones Jones
Acts like it’s nothing but got his ass whipped 3-0 pretend like it’s nothing Izzy smh what a pussy
Kudos to you Izzy! True champion. All my Love and Respect to you my guy!
Izzy just compaird him fighting gyno to a man fighting cancer 🤦‍♂️
Izzy needed this. Got complacent and needed more fuel.
Israel got knocked the FUCK OUT!!!!!!
Conor in this situation be like ''I beat myself, i tripped, hey Alex ''Your wife is in my DM's"'
It was a good stoppage by the referee ..could be worst knockout if the referred didn't stop.  Like what Joe Rogan said...could be a kick or a knee would put him to sleep
Best Ever
You can act like you don’t care all you want. But it has to be so sour that he lost again to this guy, especially him comin to the ufc only his third fight
Oh so you're a wrestler now?!?!
win or lose izzy is my favorite ufc fighter of all time along with Anderson Silva.
He could have ducked and dived this fight. But he always took on the best in front of him. That's greatness.
He is the best to do it. Dude cleared out the entire division and won 9 title fights in a row against the best of the best. Sucks that after a single loss being so active you’re no longer considered the best in the world.  Humble in defeat. Won the first round. It’s a matter of time before he gets the belt back.
Thank sir.... Your always be 👍👍👍
not that humble
Should have let Alex totally destroy him so he doesn’t come back like Izzy said he would do to him.
So in other words, Alex has made him to not move like an Izzy Bitsy spider anymore? Alex outbox him, period!
One of the best fights I've seen in the UFC. You gotta love how Izzy is always his natural self like he said "keep the same energy" win, lose or draw he's always himself. 💯
You lost me money last night but a true champion. You’ll be back
Bring back Steve Mazzagatti. That’s a good one😂
True champion humble in defeat. Izzy will be back n champion again very soon.
He fought hard good show  Shit happens   Big ups izzy   nobody missing an izzy fight  Can't win em all
Men.... Your great....
🎻
With him wear8ng that jacket. I'm glad he lost. Only losers wear fur coats.
He put him on skates, but he didn't leave him frozen, like Elsa.
Izzy now looks like a grizly with the coat.
He's in denial.
He looks concussed.
Alex beat this giy 3x already. 4th time no difference.
I was fine! lol I only wish the ref allowed it to continue would have been epic! 😂💯💥💥💥💥💥
He didn't seem confident and his post fight interview shows he knew he was gonna lose.His still champ to me and he will win that belt again.
Dizzy the Izzy 😆
Israel always so full of excuses. I don't want see the rematch..Better see Alex fight Robert. Issy can fight Khamzat 😅
Romero was right
Alex is Nagannou 2
The kicking knee he injury his self I hope they will ban that kicking knee fighters broke there bones
It makes for a good story for the rematch. Alex is his boogeyman and if he can come back and win will cement his legacy
Early stoppage……… you got to let the man go out on his sheild
Izzy giving it he would Smoke Jon Jones too 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Padahal sudaj 3 kali kalah oleh elex,gaya si erail untuk menutupi kekalahan dia 2 kali
Your leg?? Your freaking FACE! You were out in your feet, Ego’s won’t let it go
Loved seeing this guy lose! Couldn’t have made my night any better.
"Oh no, I made the champ mad with his frosted tips and gay little watch, ohhhh noooo"
Frozen like elsa
should have given him a standing 8 count
i'm not that interested in an immediate rematch, for multiple reasons. they have fought 3 times now. a rematch would be fight number 4. and Izzy doesnt have a win against this guy, it's 3-0. lets say Izzy does fight and beat him in a fourth fight, what now we have to have a fifth fight? i mean that would only be fair right if they are 3-1 right? thats gonna hold up the division massively for no reason and it doesn't make sense. plus it was a finish the second time Alex has finished Izzy, which is even less reason for another fight. im very sure Alex is ready to move on, and i think he should, theres no reason to fight Izzy again.
He could have killed you if he went for a filthy head kick but that would have killed you
Izzy better fighter than periera
Loose the pride and arrogance cocky guy and WHERE'S PETA???
Why he dressed as big foot
Him talking like that made me feel so good..definitely took the stress out of my mind…. You’re the best izzy It’s a loss and we gonna teach the world how to take a loss
Tremendous fight. But every champion has he’s day.
Not much praise for alex just izzy  haters in the comments the fight was fkn awsome
Izzy don’t fight how he fought this he should have did what he knows how to do He’s a sensible fighter
No rematch for this clown
At any given time you can be on top and then lose it all, what makes you great is to learn from your mistakes and move forward. Izzy is a great champion and he can get his belt back.
Adesanya and Usman performed great but shit happened in their fights. Nigeria forever!
So happy to see him lose no rematch
This guy's an idiot. I'm glad he lost the fight. He's too much. He got be in fair and Square stop complaining
I’m not an Izzy Izzy fan but I agree with Izzy that the stoppage seemed a little too early. Saying that, I don’t think Izzy will not beat this guy in a kickboxing match because of his size and power. He’s gonna have to train on his grappling more. Anyone with even average grappling skills will beat this guy.
He talks like such a class less punk so glad to see him get finished ,,, the stopped it before he killed you
So happy there new champ his fights were playing safe zero risk to keep the belt. First real challenge and loses no surprise.
Izzy is STILL great!
He been partying too much with white girls
Izz alys ❤❤❤❤
He did Alex dirty at the end of the first round too, karma lol
Incredible fight. Super excited for the rematch. And if he does get past Izzy again he’s gonna have a tough time with some of the grapplers in the division.
Adesanya will get it back.
Him and that stupid jacket BUT it like to see him humble. Still a great fighter!👊
You got fucken smashed stop talking shit you were out on your feet! You’re luvky it was stopped a rising knee to your head wouldve ended your career 😅
0-3 “ I could see everything I was fine “ dude was huntched over like a tard
The thing is:  Alex have 8 fights in MMA He needs to evolve and he will evolve Other thing is that THIS GUY beat Israel Adesanya 3 times. I think is time to show some respect. He is TUFF he have power he have recovery and he is the best kickboxer in the world right now… I saw him a lil bit afraid by being in a mma fight, what makes him fight with fear of get catched in grappling… but in the only round that he fought free because he was losing, he throw a big sequence and show us his power again.  CONGRATS NEW CHAMPION.
He won every round until that last moment. I'm really annoyed. Saved by the clock, and then an early stoppage in the end. All was lined up against easy despite being the better fighter.
He's not humble, Izzy is in denial.  Playing it cool like, I'm still the champ, its like no you're not.  You just got KO'd champ, by the same guy.
Sorry but... Alex is his Kryptonite... Never going to beat him, this is like the story of ken vs tito... Ken never beat tito....
Alex made this fight what it was with his insane pressure
Proper beetle juice head in the coat 😂😂😂😂😂
It was clear that his right leg was compromised.  A shame he couldnt move to avoid the strikes. A wounded Izzy lost - I think hed win in a rematch
Fruity coat that fucker hahahaha he might be a good fighter but he’s suss af 😂
honestly i hate that Alex won, he has no chance against the grapplers and it will make the ufc look bad if it goes; Alex beats Izzy again, gets beat by rob,vettori or muniz. and then Izzy beats whoever gets the belt, it’s gonna be a shitshow
Retire izzy
As someone who was routing against Israel that’s not how I wanted it to end. Props to both first main event in a long time I didn’t have a horse in the race was nice to just watch a high level fight
Looks like cartoon boy got his wick knocked in the dirt.
This guys been practicing his speech more than his fight, no surprise
Lucid u got beat for the 3rd time
If he doesn’t have cancer that Chadwick boseman comparison makes I’m looks like a bitch
Alex “frozen like Elsa”
Excuses
What a clown.
No matter izzy. Just wanted to say that no matter what…🎵🎵ooh ooh ooh! I wanna be like you-ooh ooh ooh! I wanna walk like you, talk like you, ooh ooh! 🎵 🎵
He was showing off too much that’s why he lost
To all who say this is humble in defeat. This Is Not Humble In Defeat. The ref saved him a little dignity that’s what happened
Call him boring again, that was one of the best striking and mma matches.
Periera got your number
the most boring champion I ever watched.  He will never take initiative , always waiting .... I hope Adesanya will never be champion again, there was more views on Chandler fight than main fight, so I think viewers thinking same.
Izzy got saved by the ref, was head down infront of a monster
Maybe his arrogance won't be quite as much now.
So when you sit on the table you took out the energy drink Man look at the jacket you have on you have to kill so as many animals for that jacket do you think that’s right that’s why you gonna lose and you always going to lose Perera will always knock you out out
I want Izzy to give a reaction video of his own fight while lying on pellow.........!!!🤣🤣
👀👀👀🤣 night night 🤌
The hate on Izzy is crazy and makes no sense people don’t even really like Alex they just like the fact he can get a win over him
What D**K. Izzy would have been in a coma if Pereira continued to hit him, no attempt to defend himself at all. Full of excuses!  Move on you will never get the belt back!
respect. great spirit.
Izzy hit so hard put on grandma’s coat on…you could tell he was scared of Alex all along.
He would destroy you again.
The ending of that first round was wild
Man looks cosy
Izzy, you're an absolute legend dude. Fought a good fight and didn't deserve that. Much love man!
hes probably dead or paralyzed if the ref late call for 5sec
Come back strong champ🤛🏼
Fucking arrogant poor fox in here
Yes izzzy it was great moment, you tasted left hook again, eyes rolled back yes. But Alex told you that you will be alone in the cage, Disney magics can't save you. Well Alex won the belt and rematch again and let's watch that great left hook one more time.
How can you sit there and say say Izzy controlled the fight when Izzy himself acknowledged that Alex was chopping at his leg, effectively controlling the fight.
I've never been a Adesenya fan, he's too cocky and says too many things he shouldn't. Perhaps this defeat will humble him.
Bring back Steve 😂 I swear I heard Dana white dying
Truly laughable when this guy claims to be humble lmao. Talked about himself the entire time like always.
Did all that talking and ass whooped.....
🦧
Grandma necklace grandma jacked what the hell... he needs an other loss to get humble
Izzy almost knocked him out just ran out of time in that round. And was winning the over all fight. MMA is wild.
3rd loss.... no need for 4th..but Alex wants a rematch tomorrow......Adesanya is like ..""I'm not thinking about that yet....." ....Adesanya knows he will get a 4th loss....its only down hill for Adesanya from here
Bring back Steve Mazzagatti  😂 Izzy, props man, taking that L like a champion. True character.
What the fuck is he wearing.
Bro did great but that slip up on that kick in round five fucked him up and Alex saw and took the chance
Like him more and more. Dare to be great.
Role model for how he takes these risks
Stunning coat
"3rd fight in 10 months." Show some respect Isreal was a great champ. And can become champion again.
With blue belt level in jiu jitsu any middleweight got that title , next champ whitaker , adesanya is not a purple belt under galvao?? What happened there he had that back any blue belt would have finished that  easily
You could see it in his soul he knew he was going to get tko’d the whole time.
Sooooo happy this idiot got taken out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
did anyone else have it 2-2 going into the final round?
He’ll probably cry backstage. He did say that he cried after winning the Cannonier fight because they didn’t like how he performed that night. I hope he doesn’t get bashed too much coz he takes all those comments seriously. But I rly wanted Alex to win tbh. The division was getting a little boring.
Hahaha I love Izzy 🎉
No matter how good you are, there's always that one guy maaahn 🤷🏾‍♂️😪  Otumfour Kojo Agyemang
Those fence moves are too risky. Gotta respect Izzy for doing press in win or defeat tho
He just can’t accept he was knocked out AGAIN!!!!
This coat is ugly ASF.  Thanks Izzy I won 800$ off you. Alex got your number bud
Everytime he talk about 100% guy want to fight now u got and u lost 😁😁😁
HUMBLED 😂
(I was fine)lol no no you weren't if they let it keep going you woulda got ktfo Rashad evens style 0-3 probably get a quick rematch just because he was champ and it's gonna be the same result thanks for the 400$ Izzy also the shot after the bell was his hardest shot
What a class act. In defeat i actually grew to like him more
Both men are in incredible shape to be able to take the blows that they did.
THE PERONEAL NERVE WINS AGAIN 🏆
I think a lot of weight has been taken off this man's shoulders, thanks for the memories champ 🏆
Israel dominated the fight.That leg gave up
He was out on his feet.
AMAZING interview!
No harm but this is what Izzy needed was a loss.. he was getting to big for his boots.. just wish it was widiker that he lost too...  Come bk better next time fella..
respect to Izzy, great fighter, great fight.
4:31 Dat gyno
Awesome, action packed fight! Thank you for a great show
I wonder if they rematch after Izzy middleweight streak. He deserves it for sure. Alex is the saviour for this division there is no one to fight Izzy, Just Alex. I want to see Izzy move up to LHW after wining or losing rematch.
So happy for Alex pereira
He's wearing whole sasquatch
You got humbled bro. Take it like a man. You looked out of it. If the ref wouldn't have stopped people would be crying racism for not stopping it. You don't care about black fighters and shit. That coat says it all.
I respect the way he handled his loss. No excuses or what could have been. He gave respect to his opponent.
Ahahahhahaha kamu menangis seumur hidup tidak terlupakan 3 kali kekalahan yang sangat memalukan berhenti sekarang juga kalau punya harga diri desanya👎👎👎😁😂
Early stoppage way to soon, he got robbed
So happy this furry cringy nail painted balloon it's been deflated...🤣
Glad Izzy’s doing fine, hope you can sort out your health bro! Long live the black dragon! Also, that stoppage was very stupid, I understand why you don’t want to dispute it (cause you don’t want to be that guy), but that ref jumped on the opportunity to make you lose, not to save you from getting hurt. I have a feeling he was biased, but it is what it is.
Thats How you handle life
Monster drinking company need to come out with a water base energy drink ,
Here to support Izzy  Keep moving forward and never give up  king 💪🏽
Lucid lol you where done !!! The ref saved you from getting brain damage !! It was the right thing to do
Izzy beat him but lost last minute. Damn.
1 word. Nail polish.
F to pay respect
Alex has exceptionally high connection percentage. People forget he's the Glory double champ 🏆. The world class striker, best of the best. Regular fighters wouldn't able to touch Izzy, the mixed of punches and kicks at weird angles that Preira threw and landed. It's never just power punches. The kicks took away Izzy's legs.
He got smoked. Khamzat would have have schooled him harder. Props to Alex, underdog and Rottweiler.
Kind of had to put it on the line, and had to happen sometime. Lol
You had him bro. At least you know you got him next time. Don't play with fire and rotate of thw cage to give yourself space. The whole time he had you against the cage closer up I just wanted you to throw something and rotate. That was a great fight and he doesn't have a tank. Honestly you probably had him that third round on the ground and probably could have got a rear naked chock.
His demeanor and positive vibe after the fight..The man is a winner at LIFE  #Respect🥇👏🏾🏆🫡
At least "Knockout power matters" 🤔
Izzy will bounce back. He's a beast.
Him and Kamaru lost the same way. Winning the fight and got caught in the final round. I think they'll both win their belts back in their rematches
Great fight!! What a shock... its sucks..really wanted a Adesanya win...  Is it only me but as soon as he rocked up for this interview in that ridiculous coat, the first thing that came to mind was it made him look like an Orangutan, some poor ass Orangutan was slaughtered in the name of fashion. Great fighter,  but terrible dress sense.
Big up Izzy fk Alex  PERIOD  ! GLOVER AND COMPANY TO . I PROHASKA KNOCKS HIM TF OUT
Be stoppage
Maybe he will be humbled now.
Izzy put the beats on this man the whole fight. It’s a perfect example of just “anything can happen in mma”. Alex was durable enough to last
one of the most intelligent MMA fighter, if not only one. Keep your head up Champ. Tomorrow is another day.
The Wookie lost.
Thinks something wrong I wanna watch Izzy post  fight interview but my screen... it seems to be ... frozen
Puffy in the building
Literally one of Izzy's best fights to date he was dominating Alex until the end. Hope he comes back for the rematch
I don't know! This is one of those things that we might be seeing the end of an era. The 4rth fight between them might end up going the same way, but even earlier. Not sure if Izzy can win? Especially when he's lost 3 straight times to the same guy.. he's mind may not be right.
Great Champion.... shite happens....he will be back.
Love that lion skin coat man!
Your going soft and you better be in better shape before you fight him again. Your pride got the better of you.
Classy in defeat this guy is a role model.
if it was a street fight, no time limits, adesanya would have knocked pereira out after 5-6 minutes. Time saved pereira.
Lose the orangutans coat
He loss three times to this guy . He got knockout agian to the same person . Israel can't beat this guy.  Needs to move on to his next opponent .
Haaa vakomana vapondana avo … taona zvibhakera chaizvo … Ini rangu bhiza radyiwa haro asi richadxoka rakasimba 👏🏾👏🏾💥
He can’t just say this shit every time he loses. He’s such a Drama queen and a wine bag
omg i hate Alex Piera on god
That’s the game bro. It’s never over until
I don't know how the hell you think that was his best performance every other fight he runs around the outside not getting hit this time he wants to stay six inches away from the best f****** striker in the UFC I don't think so not as best performance
Izzy hinting that he has breast cancer? Men do get it, the treatment has probably taken a toll on him.
That’s how athletes should treat their defeat, humbled and well delivered
Bring bk steve mazigatti lol😅
Izzy is a better fighter and kickboxer but power overshadows skill when the skill difference is not that much. Even in Covington and Usman, both are very close but power makes all the difference.
COOL G RAPP
The truth of the matter is Adesanya came in too cocky like he always is and he paid the price. Alex played the smart dumb game by waiting to bring it till the last round considering he was probably down on the scorecards, but he showed he can outlast Adesanya and proved he is the better fighter.
Pereirra made Izzy more humble, good 2 see!!!
C.O.A.T
Badass coat
you're never going to paint your nails anymore that's what happens when you go in the life of pimp you're a clown hahaha
Israel "but um" Adesanya
“Bring back Steve Mazzagatti”   This guy gets it 🤟
#BringbackSteve
Great coat! Winner in the wardrobe.
Izzy was beating him
Rooted for adesanya all the time but i knew he was gonna lose this time cause he is scared to put some power in his shots, you could see the difference when peiera hit him izzy whole body was shaking, compared to the lil touches he hit alex with. But looking forward to the rematch. Izzy needs to hit harder if he wants to win. Great Fight he will be back tho
Sabertooth Izzy is legit. Stock even higher now.
Great fight champ. You were kicking his ass.
I Will always root for Izzy, But what a beast Alex showed he is, Congratulations, Well deserved. Congratulations to Brasil, you needed this after Oliveira lost. Big respect to Alex Pereira.
I hate when fighters sprinkle in excuses while also giving credit to the guy
He want a rematch?  Come on man it doesn't matter how many times you fight Alex Pereira he will fck you up again and again period!
I hope all the haters are happy but Izzy still proved you wrong. You called him a boring fighter but credit to Alex he actually brought the fight to him, something none of his previous scared opponents did. Izzy was winning but Alex is just too dangerous but I’m still proud of Izzy. He’ll be back!
Tittysanya got grounded...
hE wOulD bEaT jOn jOnEs lol
israel is sick. Did u catch at 4-5 minutes through the interview he mentioned chadwick bosman fighting cancer behind the scenes and not telling anyone
Very humble mr. Adesanya , he is a good guy after all 😀. Gratz mr. Pereira what a killer! 👹
I'm a Pereira fan for sure. But I gotta say that I respect Izzy a lot more now, seeing him except this loss this way, and responding the way he did to these questions. These guys chance a lot for our entertainment.
I give props too Israel he a true champion. 👍
People who say let the guy get knocked out cold don’t understand that getting out out like that changes a fighter forever. They number of guys who where changed after that circumstance far outnumber the guys who come back at the same level or better.
This is a good day
Sorry you canmot win to Alex in a first and in a second time Loosseerrr. . .
Adesanya needs be heavier. He shouldn't change his fighting style but it was visible that these two had a difference of around 20 pounds on fightnight. Thats just too much.
Izzy was still standing  He was still in the fight  The stoppage was unnecessary    I feel Dana just wanted a new champ. So tell the referee "Once he is backed like that just stop the fight"
Where does Izzy go from here with his quest to become thet first ever cross- gender champion, he was transitioning one titty at a time... The last true Genderbender 💪😳😂
A brown bear is missing it's relative.
I am so happy Izzy lost. I hate that guy. He seriously gives me pedo vibes. Probably bc he beats off to little kids cartoons.
Your ego got smashed be fkn humble man. Your both great fighters but he got your number end of story.
Thank god he lost!
Diva
" I was lucid" ...
Alex has way more power in his hands
I think it was stopped to early. The other side was waiting for him. 🪦
Wtf is he wearing
Not his biggest fan, but I like his attitude in defeat. It's similar to Usman being shockingly chill in the aftermath of his loss. Respect! ✊🏾
It looked like he checked Izzy’s leg kick and that’s what fucked up his leg but I don’t know good shit to both of them it was a real banger💯💯💯
u was about sleep cold head good night he beat u 3 time man accept the lost like a man and hard work like u use to do nowadays u focus more on YouTube
For wearing such a fur, it serves him right that he lost  ￼
That fur is nice
True champion this guy
Humble, he will rise again 🇳🇬
He was defeated mentally before he walked in the ring in my opinion
Ref always getting the blame for the stoppage Kudos to the ref for not letting Lizzy have her head removed.
It felt like Adesanya accepted his loss before the fight started, he wasn´t as confident as always
FUCK....FUCCK???? WHAT A PUNK
U lost bro that’s all that’s it
PETA about to throw a fit with that FUR!! Style and profile, Wooo!
Nice coat, Izzy. They make 'em for blokes? 🤔
Dodgers more questions then a Dodge Ram! 😂
Yeah but this time ain’t gonna work you own way
Yeah my man… don’t utter Jon Jones name from your mouth ever again.
Love his orangutan 🦧 suit
Humble yourself champ, you got rocked
Dude Will be Champion again because Alex won't keep the title for long.Just seemed to me this was the toughest fight in his mind because of the 2 prior losses but I think the Brazilian will only get better and better so if he loses it I think he'll get to a stage where be better than ever in the next 2 years.
“My leg” “my leg happened” no buddy your head getting knocked around happended I love Izzy but take your loss like a man and give more credit to the ref he saved you from getting KO’d, Can’t wait for the rematch
My respect Izzi.. your a great champion 🏆 and legendary
I cant fucking believe this
Alex is a one dimensional fighter. Would have been submitted by any wrestler his size in one round
Very classy and lucid in this interview 👍👍👍
He's took the loss well tbh
Addasalty
Hahahaaa😂
Compromised lol fuckn guy shit didn’t happen til the 5th lol
Respect to Izzy for his response to the loss. What is he wearing though?
Izzy was out on his feet , but he done very well alex was alot heavier and he was huge in there
Obviously Izzy in pain look at him, something broken.
Nite nite termite
Hahahaha The look in his eye before fight was when he lost
LMAO!!! What’s  clown!!!
I wished a win for Izzy but this time around a loss is also a plus for new hunger , drive and energy, which I felt Izzy been losing a bit. Looking forward to the rematch. Congrats to Pereira.
Be humble 💪🏾is the way bro
Beast titan is baddest warrior but not enough to defeat Levi "Beyblade" Ackerman😂😂
lol.. wolf of wall street... "I'm not f*$&ing leaving!" 😂
HE HAD IZZY FROZEN LIKE ELSA 💀
they should stop this rehydration shit. alex was much heavier than izzy. once your chin gets checked the following punch that lands, you will feel the weight difference.
does he not realise he got KOd?
Did Israel literally kill an orangutan just to wear it
Nice jacket. Free Palestine!
I’m new to the sport. I’m a pure BOXING fan!! Can someone tell me what Israel did wrong? How did he all the sudden in the 5th round get that sloppy to where he got caught?
U should be thanking the referee for stopping it because bro u we’re gonna go to sleep straight stiff
Izzy is such a stand up guy! Rest up brother and get healthy, you'll be champ again!
is that jacket Orangutan fur? 🔥
Dude is a goat.I felt like he was grabbing for him too much and taking so many body shots.
Bro u would of been a manikin
I’m a nobody - but imo - even if Adesanya beats Pereira next time, I mean, the story is over. 3-0, 2 finishes.
It was one of your best fights. You lost, Pereira deserves his win but you will come back stronger.
And this boy thought he could see Jon …
Give him 30 secs more in round 1 and it would have been over lol but it obvious Izzy is the better fighter but this is MMA and anything can happen. Good on Alex on getting the job done but still has a lot to prove with many of the greats in the division.
Definitely deserves a rematch. Izzy was clearly winning. Almost knocked Pereria out in the first round as well. Pereria went all out in the last round and pulled off a great comeback. Congratulations to him.
Man.....great fight. Wish he didn't get clipped. It seemed like it was leaning his way a bit. Either way Alex is a beast and Izzy best rest to you brother can't wait to see you back
He be gay anyway
What is this guy wearing..! 🤡 😂
Props to Izzy. It was a great run, and he’ll most likely be back on top again one day.
Only one king left out the 3
Mazagatti putting his application back in the portal
Hahaha bring back mazzagati is top tier banter. Big fan of Izzy. Would love to see them run it back.  Alex looked absolutely humongous in there 😳
Wonder what his medical issues are
i love this guy ,wow in Defeat its admirable. its taken forever to see him after a loss. keep doing you IS-REAL
Haha u were gonna cry
You could have won this match in the 5th when you grabbed them and you had one of his leg all you had to do is kick his other leg out from underneath of them now you go to the ground with them and then that's the end of the fifth but instead you decide to stay on your feet and then you lose the belt bad coaching on Israel Adesanyas side they should have seen that when that happened that could have been the end of the fight
Half man
I bet he can cut to 170
The BETTER FIGHTER ALWAYS WIN....🏆🔥🐉 ALHAMDULLILAH ☝️
He kept Alex down with wrestling all round, landed more strikes, and that stoppage was questionable considering he dodged that last 4 punches.
"Bring back Steve Mazzagatti" damnit Izzy got my ass 😂😂😂
Respect!
Such a shame I felt like it would go this way it seemed like Alex was too big in Izzy’s mind
His team are stupid for not telling him to stick to the ground game after the success he had. I think it's time he moves on from his team and expands his horizons like GSP did.
Wwe2 The stoppage, Dana's story about putting on the earphones and listening to a movie in Perrieras corner. 😆  I was never a fan or either of these guys, but a standing stoppage in a champ fight is sus. ...can't think of a time that happened. 🤔
I wanted Pareira to win, but after all of this I like Adesanya. He is a smart guy. As for the fight itself I think Izzy was much smaller than Pareira. Pareira looked like 10 kilos or more heavier than Izzy. In terms of power it was unfair. I think Adesanya is a more skilled fighter between the two. But other guy has that left hook and heavier frame. Size difference was noticeable. Even so Adesanya is a great athlete and was a great champion. I hope he gets well and gets his chance for a revenge.
Respect to Izzy
finally he lost, one of the most boring fighters ever
A true champion this guy is.  So humble in victory and defeat
Izzy, great run, you're a real pro. If I was Izzy I'd retire w/ all my senses intact. You have the ability to make decent money as a trainer or run a series of training centers for young fighters. 0-3 against Alex & yea you came close but getting hit in the head by killers like Alex is not good for you're future. Your fans actually care about you.
They both have no taste xD

He'll be back stronger than ever cant win them all
Been calling out the KO by the left hook from hades for a while now... Nice try Elsa 😂
To be honest Alex was saved by the clock in the first rond
Izzy was not Izzy in my opinion, in the ring before the start of the match you could see in his eyes that something was wrong. The fight was not the Izzy I know. His face looks different, as if exhausted, tired. He must have had some problem. Update: This was Izzy at his 50% ability
Izzy is so unlikeable
Am i the only one who is getting Thomas Shelby vibes from him right now?😄
Sale makes fight Rob Whitakerwould finish Alex
He’s trying to act like it’s not bothering him
Good to see the lion from The Wizard Of Oz found his courage.
3 and O
Izzy officially has a new daddy named Alex “Poatan”. Congratulations on finding your Daddy.
“I was fine” sure
Izzy is addressing everyone by their name. That is respect of a champ
The referri should have given more time even though, he was out, l mean champs have some privileges.
Adesanya had to be perfect for 25 minutes to win that fight. He was perfect for 22 minutes.  He is a true champion and I believe he can beat Alex in a rematch.
Izzy fighted for that , but you can see that pereira is big and it has an effect on the match itself , like he's bigger than izzy and that's an advantage for pereira , thats why , if not izzy would have finished him surely .
I think I’m even a bigger fan of Izzy now after this loss… no excuses.. true champ.. he will bounce back no mf doubt.
Lol at leg causing the loss, you got knocked the fuck out man !!!
He isn't a nice person... Sorry.
Early stoppage
The referri should have given more time even though, he was out, l mean champs have some privileges.
3 seconds??? Unbelievable. How humble....
nice coat
He left you frozen like Elsa
Great Champ always. Doesn't shy away from anything. He'll will be OK. And will always support his family and country ❤️  congratulations to Alex P.
He loves himself so much... But it's him that will see his nemesis every day. Unbelievable. The ridiculous excuses. He lost. Not that difficult.
Israel Adesanya will always be one of the best middleweights to compete in the division. I remember watching this guy start out years ago, watching him become the champ, fighting silva and passing the torch, then this. Seven title defenses with a champ reign of almost/ over 5 years (sorry, a little forgetful atm) guys a legend. Hopefully we see another #andnew in the future for my boy Izzy ✊🏼
He wants Alex again? Lol OK
He got frozen like elsa
Congratulations champ u will be back u got this
Izzy first thing he does before interview starts he takes down the monster drink lol
The only time I saw Alex smile was when they put the belt around his waist.
I'm positive that this L will do Izzy's career good.
I love Izzy, fuck that “coat”.
🤣🤣 he said he fell because of all those calf kicks. Yeah sure
Gotta love his energy. He had a lot of pressure. Now he needs to get back and forget all this tension BS and just fight
Gracious defeat by the champ☝
nate diaz : oh you're a pimp now ?
He will become dominant again after this loss
Thoughts to all the gingers that were harmed in the making of that coat
Bruh he takes 3 L's from the same guy very well.
Did he just compare his woman titty to terminal cancer?He really is a clown
Your ego is actually saying you would have been fine and not got knocked out
Respect to Izzy as a fighter but that it is one of the worst coats I've ever seen
Well done Alex knew he'd get it done we Alex's dominating the fight game now as we should.
Izzy is done, ufc is a different sport once you take a big L like this you don’t recover. Ie Connor
He’s always put energy drinks a side he was quick on that table 😂
That's a sick coat 🔥
Alex was COMPLETELY SAVED BY THE BELL.....IZZY HAD FOO ON QUEER STREET BIKTIME DAMMIT....4 MORE SECONDS MAN.......WOOF....I saw those kicks I was screaming CHECK THOSE DAMMIT CHECK THOSE KICKS.....DAMMIT
Nobody would have agreed to fight somebody with only 3 fights in the UFC, Izzy did like always he had the balls to face the toughest challenge availibe.
Its still ckb and wakanda forever!!!
If you watched the fight Izzy won 4 rounds for sure. I saw Alex check a kick middle of 4th round and Izzy slowed down.
Didn't like Izzy didn't like Usman until they lost BOTH come across so well true martial artist and both will be champions again . respect no bullshit
Lol, wonder how many PETA emails he recieved.
Incredible performance from both of the athletes, kudos to both of them! Truly hope whatever medical problems Adesanya has are resolved as best to their ability.
Still the greatest of all time
HE WANTS REMATCH? WHAT? IS HE THINKING THE RIGHT WAY? HE WAS TKO'D FOR THE 2ND TIME AND LOSS 2 TIMES TO ALEX THIS GUY IS FUNNY AS HELL HE IS GONNA BE MCGREGOR'S WANNA BE. BUT HE WAS UNLUCKY COZ HE ALMOST KNOCKED OUT ALEX BUT WAS SAVED BY THE BELL. THOUGH ALEX'S HURT HE STILL ENDURED AND PATIENCE GOT HIM THE RIGHT TIMING 🙂.
Bring back mazagati...BWAHAHAHAHA I love this guy now dammit I'm a fukin izzy fan now........aye wakanda!!¡!!! Lol
I told everyone he was going to lose. You all put him on a pedestal, as soon as he got pressured he didn’t know how to survive.
Izzy get way too much unwarranted hate!  Pereira is just scary!
Izzy didn't have the reach advantage which he massively relies on in his fights. For once he got hit from distance and was out of reach for a counter. I think Alex wins the rematch. Just a bad matchup for Izzy's style..
Izzy turned into Elsa for real tho. My mans tried ice-skating out of danger but he got caught. Tried to clinch his way out of there looking like Vettori. Mans turned into Israel Adelasagna. Love the trash talk firing back.
Class act bruh
7 names have changed positions as title holders in 2022. I can't confirm this but I do believe that it points to a potential golden age of the UFC. Think about it guys, our champs were nearly all active af this year and most of the paid the price for it. Big respect to all the fallen legends in the making, Izzy is going to be back! I believe that! Charles will be back, Usman will be back! 2023 is gonna be a crazy year boys! Here's to 8 more next year!!
My guy no matter what 💯💯💯💯‼️
Bleeding dope wtf is he wearing 🤦‍♂️
Pereira has Izzy's number. Like Chris Weidman to Anderson Silva.
No more Izzy as champ. Life is great
Respect to Izzy. Handling defeat with class. Will always be a fan of his
Israel will return to Glory thus sayeth  “ The Lord”  Congratulations Alex You are a Champion!
Not being racist but 🦧??
the running chicken no longer found a place to run, congratulations pereira, this one did not deserve the throne.
Love the coat!
Idk what the judges said, but Izzy only won one round from what I saw
.beaten at his own game....scared he was in his head .
The fuckn man still idgaf!! 💯💯 Keep the same energy your the man izzy! 💪🏽
Bro said of course like he wants to get beat up a fourth time lol
I told this mf if he doesn't k.o pereira in the 1st rnd then hell defz getting knocked out in the 3rd! Guess i was right😎
He not Floyd Mayweather, ducking real fights. Floyd 50-0. Nobody gives a fkn! Unless you black...
You are great Izzy. Never avoided any fight and this guy is 35 lbs larger than him. I want same day weigh ins
its ok to get countered, happens to everyone
I just knew Alex would win he's is a fuckin beast
3rd time losing to one opponent
U know i couldn't help but notice Adesanya Lil comment about sounding like Whittaker & his immediate reaction 2 his own revelation. Why does he seem 2 have venom 4 Whittaker? That guy is so respectful & polite. I legitimately don't get it
Izzy is great. The way he articulates his feelings even after a loss and staying real and humble is very inspiring and respectable. He really owns his outcomes even when it's not the desirable one. I am very sad about the outcome but he still is the best and greatest yet. There's no one like Izzy! Looking forward for a likely rematch.
Bro love u your still the champ
Those pearl and wearing finger frost tips  is taking over his brain.
CLOWN. Boring fighter finally got his just do
Got that arrogant but beat 3xs by Alex. Finally and New.
Sore loser didn’t even congratulate his opponent, well deserved lose.
Once again he dresses like a prostitute.
Da fook is he wearin!?!?!?
I love this Man For his Honesty for me you áre the best Medlewight ever 😎☺️👊
Shows up!
Izzy fought like a beast, humble too. Good man
Seperti roda ndak selama nye di ats,..
Ego breakdown, just like joshua.
Izzy won’t get the belt back just straight facts 💯
Starched him
i admire this guy so much
Adesanya is a great
Alex checked his kick... was a calf kick
No more champ Rip Izzy
I don't buy this humble in defeat shit. This is the same guy was butt f#%*ing after a victory. He honestly thinks if the ref let it go he would've ended up winning. How is that humble?
Wallllllh dana ... conor mcgregor voice
How can this guy beat a wrestler
2 African Champs beat up one more to go. Jones vs Nagano.
Izzy iz the best.
Is he kidding he actually said that he was okay the m************ about ready to fall forward damn can't get the man props for coming back after losing one or two rounds rocked your ass could have really put you out but the rest saves you and you're saying s*** happens what a f****** piece of Dookie
Too many excuses
Go Easy ... Go !!!!  You  di a great match
What I see is far from the same energy you're not telling everybody I Told You So you're not boasting and bragging it's definitely a different energy I'll have to give you props you did well but it can show that you were nervous with this guy the way you were fighting him you have never ever grappled other than to get up from a takedown but you were the one initiating a takedown so if anybody was shook before during after this fight it was you and he got caught by you as well so got to call it where it is but he had the ultimate say so in the end and lucky for you the ref was there to stop it and anybody says early stoppage he could really have messed you up thankfully you both came out with good health
So… no one gonna mention his chimpanzee costume?
Good riddance to that arrogant mong
I cant stand seeing people wearing a stupid expensive watch on the wrong hand lol AND pearl necklaces are for woman smh
Need that slavery genie
You are my champ Iast style bender , In round 3 took more energy , just stay with the jab , dont look for a submission , keep the punches kudos to AP he is a champ, the last round umm ..
Same thing you said for the Yan blahovich fight took a chance dare to dream whatever you lost you got ktfo! Maybe you'll lose some of that bravado and cocky and arrogance and get a little humbleness in your self and maybe you'll win a fight like that anybody you false is the same size was a lot less experiencing what you've done you've made it pretty easy even the ones you fought in MMA have only had seven or eight years of training you've had over 20 and what you've done so it's not like you did the same thing done for the same amount of time, you were a professional while they were just learning
Izzy fought great, oss!. Alex is fkn huge for middleweight!!
I can see the fear in him
I think we see the problem: he's been walking around in a suit of the cowardice lion from Wizard of Oz. Just kidding. Great fight champ, I thought it was an early stoppage for sure.
I'm not really buying the act. This sport is great and always will be great because of the highs and lows
He looked proper nervous everytime pereira walked him down.
All class
You can see how comfortable this man is. I have a feeling he didn't train as much as he wanted to, and knows he still has mad potential. I genuinely feel sorry for his next opponent coz his hunger just got reignited. No excuses 🙏🏾 Let's go champ.
All he is short is lipstick and a wig
Still a goat. Every dog has his day and pereira is a frickin wolf
Imagine wearing that coat after that loss
😭
Izzy is down 0-3 against this man. That's hard to believe.
So happy Izzy lost, look at that pathetic coat.
They could make a movie between this two
Ufc doesnt want izzy become champ again,, because izzy fight boring
I hope Pereira will be a good father figure for Izzy now that he has asserted his parenthood
No rematch... Defeated u 3x!
He didn't lose. ref stoppage prob woulda got dropped. Izzy won . Pereira bleeding out of his ears . Izzy ax kick drop
Gyno surgery completed !
Alex needs to sleep him next time.
"Win or lose, I know who I am"  Feels like this quote applies to izzy. He has a strong mentality for sure. He went in the fight confident and did his thing and left the same way. As childish as he might act sometimes, he does give off the vibe of an old wise man sometimes.
Such a sharp Wise man! A true Champion
All dressed up and Got No Belt, Usman did the same thing 😂
Not an izzy fan and I'll be the first guy to call BS on an early stoppage. This is why I agree with him, I'm glad to see the refs taking such good care of the fighters but considering it was a championship fight I think they could have let Izzy try to hold on for a few more shots. If you watch the slowmo he's definitely dazed but fully conscious, he never stopped moving his head. I consider that defense and the ref should have let it go especially considering that the belt is on the line. No hate towards him, I just think he was a little fast on the stoppage considering the title being on the line for izzy. With that being said I'm not a blind man, easily 1 more shot from Alex could have been fully lights out, he was probably still going to lose.
Pereira keep hitting the calf leg and that’s what got Izzy ! But still my champ 🙌
He never mentioned any physical stuff he’s been dealing with until he lost
What a champ… you’ll get him on the next one..
So much class in defeat, can't believe this guy has the amount of haters he does.
Stop making excuses Izzy. You’ve flattered to deceive since you got to the UFC this was a well deserved loss
Should have saved the fur for the w.
Respect to Izzy for standing his ground against a guy like Alex and for dealing with the loss like this.
The Man!  He is wat all the kids look Upto . A real 1 Solid Izzy . NZ Nigeria represent🇳🇿🇳🇬
Adesanya is wicked💥
Look both fight....i think easy khamzat by 1 round
He was less patient with the bs questions in this interview. Nobody likes losing and hes a very emotionally driven person that really analyzes and deep thinks about things. This loss will bug him for a while as he goes through all the should/woulda/coulda scenarios. I hope he eventually has the chance to turn the tables on this loss, otherwise this guy will haunt him for life.
tree lions died for this coat
Bring back Steve Mazzagatti and Yamasaki, and make the ufc great again!
He knew he was gone lose
Lmao you wasn’t fine !! Boy Hit like a Mac truck 4th rank
Nothing against this man n congratulations to alex for that hard fought battle to acquire the belt. My honest advice for izzy  when u stand stIll against the wall next to alex is far more dangerous than any other opponents. If u had kept the fight in  centre of the ring then everyone knows the  outcome of that.
UFC fans are cold asf these days , so easy to sit at home in comfort behind your screen and talk mad shit about izzy. But love to lick his ass when he’s winning lol now I guess ppl are gunna lick Alex’s ass now 🤣 🤦🏾, win or loose IZZY is the man took the loss like a boss kept classy even though he had alot to loose you gotta respect the man ! Much love from NEW ZEALAND 🔥🔥
New respect for Mr. Adesanya
Everyone have their boogeyman
Dam good fight.. dam good. We really got our money worth.
You either great undefeated  Or your not great That's it..... Only a Certain Kaliber of Fighter Achieves that kind of Greatness  Unfortunately Izzy is just not....
Izzy put it on the line and got KO’ed. that’s exactly what would have happened to him if he put it on the line against Romero too!
TBH respect
What an absolute gentleman and good sport.
TRUE CHAMP!!!🙏🙏👊👊👊👊👊👊
Everyone keep saying I like him now because he took the loss like a champ. As if that wasn't what u guys have been praying for. Now u guys have it! Anyways my boy is come back stronger in no time.
Such an arrogant prick. Nothing in this sport made me happier than seeing him get rocked like that. I just wish Alex would’ve knocked his sissy head off his shoulders. No room for gays in MMA. Now he can go back to NZ and suck “D” on the beach again with his cute painted fingernails and his bleached blond hair. I’m sure he’s already got his Speedo packed.😂
Seeing Izzy’s facial reaction when he said it’s all about my team and then realizing that’s all he has left after losing the belt … tough
so apparently we need to feel sorry for Izzy because of his chest and it is the same thing as some guy fighting cancer what a fucking bozo he is, making excuses ah my leg ahh hit me in the cranial piss off take the L like a champ you should be used to it by now getting beat up by the better fighter.
Wearing that coat after a loss is crazy confident.
Yo does he have cancer man hope the best for him
Dont fuck whit hunter gatherer. ....adesanya sht up
Am really happy for you guy cuz you main slot to me.still my champion
He can’t beat this guy
Poirier vs Chandler was the main event for everybody.
We love you Israel no matter what brother.
Props 2 Both men . one hell of a fight !🔥 💪 👊
Izzys the Man he be back !! Best Champ Ever!!!!
IZZY THIS GUY IS 3 UP ON YOU, WHAT MORE U GONNA SAY, 100 FIGHTS LATER IZZY STILL THINKS HE WILL WIN
thanks ref, because off you adesanya is okay 🤣alex💪💪💪
Israel quite humble. The fur is Fire on the champ...........................
All good we all seen the fight great fight. Flex flex flex he is no leaving. 😆 lol  Flex  leg  the leg  not the punches. We Don’t realize how dangerous you are on the ground 😊we don’t realize the ground game.
Jones somewhere laughing right now  😂😂
He said out loud he doesn't care about anybody but his team, who does that? like I said arrogant....
I really want Izzy to knock the hell out of Alex now. Man, he is such cool humble beast.
What is he wearing? My god 🤣😂
Told you..he's not that good..lol!!! Just propped up.   Jon Jones laughing his ass off....how many loses this makes isreal???
Such an arrogant piece of s***
U gotta admit, perirra is better than izzy, 1st fight u lose ok, 2nd fight well, 3rd fight ok its clear.  Look izzy has been in mma longer than alex and again alex comes into izzys world and again gets put away. Izzy cockiness get too  him
Looking forward to seeing Jon Jones getting knocked out at Heavyweight
Your ego is gone and that’s a need, so you better be more humble moving forward.
Respect...pure and simple.
Nigeria 🇳🇬🇳🇬 is with you now and forever
Win or lose this was the best fight i hv seen.
This is gonna follow Izzy forever if u a hater or fan it will the man that haunted u in a video who knocked u out in kickboxing then came to your house aka the UFC and won by knocking u out!
Stoppage was good. He may think he was there but his hands weren’t covering and was a another shot or two from taking a good nap in there. That’s taking some time off his life.   He was absolutely gonna go out. Alex wasn’t anywhere close to stop throwing those bombs on his dome
Why he stopped it he was still standing
the second african has fallen😎😂😂😂
Adesanya, you lost the fight fair and square, that's it man, finish.. done... Suppose If the refree should've let the fight continued, you would be dead dumbass. Alex could have killed you easily. And that is fact.
a sore looser
Very classy in defeat, a real inspiration. Don't think he deserved to lose that at all, but no doubt he'll be champ again soon. 👏👏👏🇳🇿👑
I love adrsanya being like that hes my champion
Even if he beats alex 2x in a row. Alex is still ahead 😂 thats tough. Hope he fight khamzat next. He aint the champ anymore. No more excuse about ladder
What a F***K**G beast! Put on a show for us all... Rematch
thats why i was so excited because i knew either one could get clipped at any moment and everything just be over
He forgets to use front kick to keep him off, that has undone him. He should have cleaned him with straight front kick to his chin.
Heal up Champ one of the most dominant champ in middleweight history
I think my favorite part about this is Izzy actually telling John in a way to fck off, and gave someone else a chance to ask a question after tubby gets to ask all his
AND THE NEW .. Alex is a fuckin animal
Humbled
Man I don't understand why he was putting his back against the cage when he knew he was looking for that left Hook all night
i don’t feel nothing for this guy..i am surprised he didn’t fart or eat a pizza while talking,
Not trying to make excuses for Izzy, but the UFC has to change the weight classes and find a way to stop fighters from cutting so much weight. Izzy was at a big disadvantage size wise and that just should not be a thing at all. However it seems like Alex is just the superior kickboxer. His timing, speed and precision is out of this world.
So much for that jon Jones talk lmao. Dare to be great every time he dares he gets humbled. Loving this loss for Izzy. Lmao
"I was fine" Utterly not fine, hands down, eyes rolling, barely moving head, falling, not fine mate
What a stupid looking coat
Big mouth n show of always lose...
Ronaldo move with the Monster bottle. Everyone telling Izzy outclassed him all 3 figth  remember that he lost the 3 of them, so I guess thats part of the strategy rather then luck
Don’t forget he was champion fire like 5 4 years
A true champ. Levels above moneybags mcg.
Damn I was hoping I won that moneyline when I woke up I was wrong
Incredibly proud of Izzy and everything he has done in the UFC. Looking forward to seeing him become champion again.
That coat is crazy!
I've been back and forth on liking Izzy but this fight and the class he shows after makes me a fan for good!
Soooo happy seeing this  trans⚧gender ass beraten. Fuck fanboys
Alex is too big at the weight. Don't see anyone beating him at middleweight. He will knockout Chimaev too.
And you can fight with big dady Jon ?  Come on   Jon can beat you bouth at same night
Izzy was not the same at all I knew he was done. What made it weird was Izzy never came out to a great entrance. super sus
I believe Pereira wanted it more difficult to see Izzy Adesanya lose as I think his skill range is better than Pereira's Izzy should of let the matrix skills pop off more as he has the ability. Unfortunately Izzy was second best it's brilliant to see him take the loss on chin and talk appropriately to the interviews. I do feel like Pereira just has Izzy's number game of chest at the moment Izzy is being checkmated.
Not got much sympathy for Izzy as he has been very disrespectful to Alex. Got dominated in the first round but lucked out with a punch at the end of it to steal the round. Won the round when he took it to the floor cos he knew he could not compete with Alex in stand up. Alex is the alpha out of them and owns him at kickboxing and now beat him in his own field. If you locked them both in a room and left them to it Izzy would surely end up dead.
That power is always the difference
He is HUMBLE NOW!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm not an izzy fan but had respect for him after taking his defeat like a man .Well done
Jizzy fanboy naruto running away crying , this feels good i would hve felt bad for him if he didnt had such a big mouth and ego
He didn't have to fight him as he still didn't deserved a title fight yet but ufc had to push it for PPV
Fashion victim
Got to fight smart. Got to fight to win. Fight defensively and Coast in 5th round to a easy unanimous decision
Got the same shit going on in my right chest. Seen the doctor they said it's fat tissue. Had me paranoid asf for a long time I hope he has the same thing and nothing serious.🙏🏼
Maybe if you carried a New Zealand flag, the country would’ve been behind you!
Yeah 1st round ref is stepping in cause the bell buzzed Alex put his guard down and not the first punch but the second one that got him good was after the bell I know it wasn't on purpose but shouldn't give yourself credit
Israel the warrior 🪖...🙂👍
Adanya before this fight: Yo this guy is nothing, he will be in a bar talking about that KO for years, I'm gonna f*ck him up Adanya after the fight: DaRe tO bE GReAt
Team Izzy still
Hahahahaha so good to see this clown lose ! Cya Elsa forever Pereiras son
Why you lying lmao you was out cold and ref saved you
It's the First Take Curse. How many athletes, especially fighters that have gone on there have lost within their next 2 fights.
Yeah Alex is a beast like that!!. Good fight from both fighters.I don't think a rematch is necessary tho. Alex is better
Some boy. Showed a lot of class tonight, he will be back 👏🏻
you same energy ambulance 🖐end off story pereira your master
Dude was bent over, arms down doing nothing, getting punched in the head, was a fine stoppage
I’d like to see it again to be honest
I like Izzy, but he was alwasys overrated, and reigned over a very, very weak 185lb division. Chimaev would beat both of these fighters easily.
This is how to take losses amazing attitude Izzy will be back better then ever
This has made me so happy seeing the fake Nigerian lose like his other fake Nigerian fighter arsman  Good times
👑
He was retreating all the time. Alex was all over him.
fuckk adesanyaaaa but FUCK THAT ALEX PEREIRA 1st roound did something and thats all  aint like both but adesanya did much to win as it style is i hate that runner style but deffo pereira didnt deserves to win WITAKKER WILL TAKE HIM APART YOU LL SEE
Can we stop with the f word….kids are also into MMA
He won't beat Alex unless he becomes a complete fighter.
Is he wearing a lion 🦁🥳
I love you izzy❤
Respect for these UFC warriors/fighters. Another future UFC Hall of Famer. Just a win away from tying Anderson "The Spider" Silva for the most wins in UFC Middleweight. Ahm, just like you said "shit happens". It's not even your last fight and you still rock man, The Last Stylebender. Congrats to Alex "POATAN" Pereira. #AndNEW #TheLastStylebender #PoatanPereira #UFC281 #UFCinMSG #UFCForLife #WeAreWarriorsAndFighters #RematchInTheMaking
Ooh now I get it, that thing that he said about Elsa...he was talking about himself🤣
was lucid but straight eating punches nd dropped his hands lmaooo dudes not humble at all his corner told him to stfu and not to cry about it haha copium
The story between the two isn’t over, and Izzy is going to write the final chapter in spectacular fashion.
Izzy wanted to beat him standing more than he wanted to win. He could've worked in some level changes and take downs and beaten him on the cards. His pride defeated him... and Alex of course.
What a stupid guy. Deserves to lose especially wearing that jacket
Had the 1st round been 10 secs longer  it would have been “ AND STILL”
I picked Alex, because Izzy to much girl in him look at his coat.if I was a man fighter no girls coat after lose.
He believes that he would have made it to the end of the round if the referee had not stopped the match.. :D
GOT LEFT FROZEN LIKE ELSA 😂
He’s positive and proud because he lost this fight in his head first. He lost to him twice and he was huge so the fact he did as good as he did . He’s happy with his performance
This man full of himself. I happy went he lose
I was gonna give him props, and then he uses the people say I'm Skinny, line. Bro get over it, that shit was before you were champion literally no one has said that in years and it was only Costa trolling you for being skinny cause he knew you always talk about like your sensitive. And comparing yourself to Chadwick, Chill. I get Chadwick wasn't a fighter but he always carried himself very respectful. Izzy on the other hand got and Ego trip. This interview is the first time I seen Izzy a bit more humbled but has the arrogance.
Cya later last style bender😂finally some one new with the crown👑how refreshing,great win by Periera👊inya face
They let chandler period all over porier but don't let adesyana fight on when he was covering up to stop punches from Pereira? Stupid stoppage!
Said all along pereira would beat him
the  bitch got frozen  like Elsa
He should be attacking not just defending.. Big losss.. I know the difference Izzy's body proportion are all equal while alex hands are quite big for his body..
The meme’s if Izzy in this coat 🧥 is gonna be epic 😂😂😂
much love Izzy 💪🏿🤙
Izzy is the man I don't care if he did lose. They'll be another fight.
For me it was an early stoppage. For me.
Great to see so much respect in the comments. When a champ becomes that dominant, all the trolls come out of the woodwork and it takes a humbling moment like this to see some appreciation shown again for the champ.
On paper alex is the better fighter but when you watch their fights izzy is just out class him everywhere.. my champion Israel Adesanya ❤
Wow, what a great person. Sometimes it's worth losing to show your true colours.
One thing we’ve learned is Izzy needs to read a book on submissions for dummies 101. Didn’t even bother to go for a rear naked when he had his back. Meanwhile Khamzat licking his chops
True champion through and through.
Loose the bitch Fury coat
Content for mujahid 😄😄😄
Ref stopped that way to early
Same style of loss from the very past first fight,,,,left hook,,,Alex is in strong shape ,,,same as cyborg movie,,,the opponent of jean Claude van Damme
He needs to be more aggressive, follow up those jabs with some hooks & uppercuts
Pimp coat....Ha Ha Ha Ha.....looser.
You are cool. He is cool.  Nice jacket
You guys in here giving him props...a true sportsman would have given the man his just due...regardless of what adesanya says... HE'S 0-3 against this man! All I heard was excuses, "my leg...my leg...my leg....I was ok".... NO YOU WEREN'T BUDDY, YOU WEREN'T OK...glad he got beat yet I can tell he still hasn't been humbled....0-3! Swallow it buddy YOU GOT FROZEN LIKE ELSA!
Why is Grace Jones being interviewed about Izzys fight?
He got his ass handed to him 😂😂
Awesome to hear Te Reo on the big stage ❤️ also AND NEW 💪
the gyno is from PED's bro everyone knows...
“My health comes first “ but didn’t want the fight stopped if Alex would’ve kneed him shit could have been bad .. but I fuck with u Izzy u ite plus u real woke and know about the Epstein cover ups and say Fuck  cancel culture smart dude hats off to both fighters epic fucking fight!
Respect but like I keep telling everyone about the “I was winning the whole fight mentally” the problem is it should never be used if he finishes you in K.O.’s.
Man loss is loss win is win
0-3
Dare to be great but never wrestles is mma. This is why you lose. Dont kickbox 95% in MMA because if it wasnt alex khamzat would ragdoll you.
Graceful in defeat, the stoppage was fine but one punch he would have been really out .
Not a fan of Izzy but he’s a great fighter and he deserves a rematch
Alex has made Izzy a humble man now
Mad respect for this warrior. He’ll come back from and be better for this as a fighter. Alex is a beast though. It’ll be a fun rematch.
This is how you humble a cocky fighter, a KO/TKO.
izzy haters are more cringe than jake paul fans, they literally say anything to discredit someone who honestly is going down in history even if he loses 3 more times
i like Izzy but why is he promoting fur products
Respect izzy way of taking the L. He already put it behind him In a way n ain’t let it effect him. He talked to the ppl he had to talk to right away instead of being in his emotions and is already planning on working on himself so he can get back ina cage respect when it’s due
Fought a guy he lost to 2 times..now a third..mustve been intense feeling that. But he definitely did his thing, had alex stumbled, on the ground. I think Izzy needed this push/lost
Rip bozo
Never cared for Izzy. Glad someone shut his LGBTQ mouth.
Izzy has to be a dream for UFC, talks great, great fighter and has to be the most active champ/ex-champ of them all
Pereira wass less good he got lucky
deff deserves an instant rematch he did not have to take this fight
Israel full respect to you no excuses very humble I am sure you will reset regroup and rise to champion once again! Very humble guy . One of the best! It just wernt his night! Full respect.
Young man, you got knocked the f*** out
No sympathy, if you're beat, you're beat. You can say you were winning all 3 fights unless your hand gets raised then thats it.
What i hate is that the narrative is now going to focus on Alex... People like Joe rogan, dana white etc will kind of push izzy to the side like they do to everyone
Conducted himself like a champion even upon losing. Respect Israel, you're the man. Enjoy your money for a few months!
I hope he sees the comments. Izzy. People will beat him and people will beat you. But it’s all okay.
no more izzy the heel. thankkgod
Damn 1 belt still in africa. We need to get them back. Usman and israel will get it back soon.
Is it just me or are everyone fucking blind? Fosure Izzy was winning but he didn’t destroy or outfighting pereira or something. Pretty even fight but yeah Izzy winning until the ko. Don’t take anything away from pereira, he so deserve this win. Absolute savage, awesome performance
Got more respect for Adesanya after this loss... than what  ive had for him on his previous 6 victories. Humble in defeat 🏆
Izzy should retire first time knockout in MMA next time fights Alex he'll get finished inside 2
I think Israel is just happy it's over with even if he did lose. This was a huge weight on his shoulders and I think they run it back and hopefully these two become martial artists and learn how to get up from a takedown
We only need a grappler and Alex Perera is thrown from the crown in a light speed
Great to see the belt is heading back to Brazil. Enjoy your humble pie Izzy
Alex in his mind forever, he took everything from him. I think he now himself that he will never win over him
Izzy is a great fighter,fought a very dangerous man who has beat him twice,no soft touches for him just the best of the best
Weight difference Matters
Damn straight. Congrats to the champ Alex, and excited to see Israel back at it again
What a guy
You can tell Izzy and Robert Whittaker kinda like or respect eachother, of everybody to think of he thought he sounded like Rob😂  They have a mutual friend in Volkanovski, and some of their coaches are friends as well… I see these two as guys that could end up having a drink together or just being friendly buddies maybe when they no longer have to fight eachother.
Was great seeing him get beat again. He was getting a big mouth. The ref should have let him get smashed up a little more before ending the fight. Guys both put on a good show
Naaaaa really when talking sh…. Goes wrong 😂😂
This dude has izzy's number. Izzy will never beat him.
I can't stand izzy but he's definitely matured the last couple years. I couldn't imagine him acting like this if he lost a couple years ago. He was a good champ and I'm sure he'll get a rematch before next summer
Is he wearing a fucking bear 🐻 😂
This MF is D_O_N_E
Alex is just so powerful, and his stamina is unreal. He can take all of Izzy’s strikes and in the 5th he looked almost 100%. I think DC said Izzy had to be perfect for 25 mins to win and I agree w that. Probably will be Izzy’s toughest matchup he ever faces.
Great stoppage. He was in lalala lane.
I'm proud of you brother! Lets get that title back
grizzly adesanya
What a freaking fight and happy for Alex 👍✌️
Feel so bad for him.
Still the best fighter, if u watch all 3 fights , Izzy better but Alex just get lucky , it’s crazy …the very 1st time they fought , Izzy won but they gave it to Alex
Damn!!! I am so f-cking mad behind this result. I am such a sore loser.  Can't be happy for Porrera. 🖕
Welldone bro u wil come back stronger
You're still the best, Izzy.
Take that coat off
Wussup with the dead animal on his shoulders? Is everyone afraid of this sweet tart with the name of the Syn.agogue of S.atan?
Alex has a horrible defence but he makes it up with his granite chin , good offence and nuclear powered left hook 🪝.
Ha ha
He’s fucking useless as a fighter too defensively minded and thinks he’s an anime character
Pereira is a beast, and his mentality was the key to win. even when he was getting  his ass kicked, Adesanya was scared.
That fight was one of the best fights I've watched and Izzy really brought the fight. I gotta give Alex the credit as well , dude's recovery rate is top notch and the speed in which he saw the opening to make Izzy pay after that leg trip. This was beautiful.
It is clear that none of these guys is clean, but it is clear that Pereira is using. Just looking at his skin and musculature.
So glad this arrogant filthy loudmouth got his backside handed to him. The ref saved you from being knocked out cold. Your reign is over Peanut head.
He Was scared throughout the fight!
Pereira real man but Adesanya is a kid thats why he loss
Humility
Next is Francis jon is gonna fuck him up too
the best fighter of all time.  his name is anderson silva.  9 years dominant in the category.  the most complete... talking nice and talking cheap didn't help izzy in the fights with poatan
I was not a izzy fan, but the way he bowed to croud after his loss, 🫡 respect him man, and damn, he was a better fighter, even in kickboxing, but alex periera’s power was just way too much for him to handle.
Izzy looking nervous in this fight than his previous fight
CAN U SAY IZZY the LOSER
Good for him. You said, its okay for Rogan to call us monkeys? Take that ass whipping with you clown 🤡
A real man right there
Poatan!
That’s the proper way to accept a loss and respond to it! You can tell this loss will only make him a better fighter in the end. He’s handling it with class though and will be back on the grind in no time. If he’s gonna reclaim the title I think he’s gonna have to do it pretty fast. Lots of amazing wrestlers on the come up that will be contending for that strap in the next year or so.
Humbled AF😂
Dude is jus naturally bigger an stronger than Izzy.....IZZY IS A TRUE CHAMP...BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THIS FIGHT ANYMORE...u can tell by his expressions....but it's all good champ... someone ALWAYS has ur #...this is the person who has his🤦🏾‍♂️
When the cocky fighter you dick ride loses. "He's so humble".
Dudes class.
I swear these people ask the stupidest questions 😭🤣
The division needed this...
🤣🤣🤣
IZZY WAS PLANING NOT KNOCK ALEX OUT BUT TAKE HIM BY POINTS AND HE HAD MANTAINED IT ONLY THAT ALEX USED HIS CHANCE WELL HE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY
Bro the media r clowns
This fight was like Edward va usman . If he was not getting knockout Izzy had a chance to win by decision
It’s not over this is still war - Stylebender
Izzy get in line Whittaker is next.
what a champion first comment on how he feels “grateful”💪🏼🤣
Ahahahaha
😂how can u wear that after being ko'd.
There is no way he was lucid and was in control there
Izzy loses against Alex 10 out of 10 times. It was impending doom for Izzy the entire fight and everyone knows it.
This is what happens when you come to fight- Yoel romero.
Respect to both fighters. But also, UFC needs to reassess their weight rules. He had atleast 15lbs over Izzy.
It's is what it's.  Sometimes you won sometimes you lose.  He destroyed entire middleweight.  Respect him guys. 💪
Losing 3 times in a row must do something mentally to someone.
3:44 🤣🤣🤣
Butchyboyed it Glass Chin. I was still there you gave up
Izzy is even cooler in defeat. I like this guy.
I knew he was gone loose he just can’t beat him
Love this kid, he is the greatest star in the UFC. Alex was saved by the bell in the first round.
Respect to izzy, the man has already won in life you will be back champ also he's as real as it gets none of the fakeness u get with Jon jones
arrogant will be humbled😂😂😂,
Bruh stop downplaying that shit
adesanya said is not over :)  men, the guy beat u 3times :))
I have a feeling wherever Izzy goes, Alex will follow him there and knock him out 😅.
Izzy you’re the best. I love you my blood. Forever champ
Shit happens it's the fight game! Can't win every fight! And that was going how I thought it would and ye dude pulledviy outta the fire
Drake curse he had 2 mill on him
Izzy got dizzy
Respect ti Izzy but boy is Alex composed under pressure. Took the title almost casually in the last round after falling behind. Will be a rough road back for Izzy I think
Horrible dude
Come on Izzy, that was a completely different fight, even in the early rounds you were holding back..  you didn't defeat your demon. You were avoiding his left hook till it hit you... and then... all she wrote. Gotta admit.. that Pereira left hook has demon power.
So so happy this smug arrogant floppy lost, so happy, you look like a clown in your fur coat 😄🤣. He will never be the same fighter
At home he gonna cry.
Class Act.....very gracious in defeat. The mark of a great champion.
Nothing against Pereira he deserves to be the champ, but I feel like he will not be an entertaining one  Izzy was the one who you still consider as a Superstar  I think there will be a new champ soon after watching Pereiras Grappling Skills
Damn this has been my favorite fighter for a long ass time, and now I like him even more. I’m so ready to see him get the rematch. It’s MMA, not Kickboxing, so maybe to break this Alex curse he should just go for takedowns through the entire 5 round until he’s able to get him down. My man outclassed him the whole damn fight once again & gets KO’d. I was gutted seeing him endure that again. People talk so much shit about this man for really just some bullshit reasons, I just wanted to see him continue to shut all of you hating ass mfs up 😂😂
U care about that belt Izzy,  acting like u don't.  When u had the belt u cared so much. U got humbled Tonight
Humble in defeat... what a guy!
"I got some things to fix first" = gyno surgery lol. I don't know why it's taking him this long to get the surgery done. Maybe because he's been prepping for fights.
izzy daddy's home now. relax stand in line with robbie and rest of division
i fucking love how he doesn't let defeat bring him down
This guy has more excuses than skills fighting that's for sure
Am I the only one that thinks Alex would of easily been winning this fight if it wasn’t for that second he let his guard down in the first round , all judges gave Izzy that round when his biggest shot was landed at the end of the bell, and then second round Alex wins, so up 2-0 would of been a easy victory for him I think and give him more time to work take down defense and Izzy got no chance with this man
"Dare to be great" Ya we heard this before.  Twice now.
Real men are accountable on all levels we don't sit here and make excuses up on all levels which is what all these Fighters do you got out class you got out fought Point blank. Into f****** discussion I've been waiting to see you get beat forever fight Jon Jones or shut the f******
It was a late stoppage you could tell he was outve it when he just collapsed
If they didn’t stop the fight he could have and most likely would have gotten severely hurt.
adesanya still on gyno, he is priding himself with being active, but then when he's asked to return, he mentions his health and immediatly the tiddy. People often try to deescalate things in their head by sharing them, making it seem as it's normal to develop a tiddy after 25. whole lotta fake confidence coming from adesanya fr, he cant't bear being number 2.  After the fight he said "I fucking hate this guy" to his corner, but now he's saying things like I'm grateful, like brudda u is hurt
Damm my bro got humbled..it happens..still my bro
Izzy was in big trouble. But I would have liked to see it play out without stoppage. Let the champ go out on his sword.
The casuals dont know who Steve Mazagatti is. plebs
imagine what jhony bony would do to h1m...absolute Annihilation
This dippy Kiwi reporter. Asking a question to something he already discussed.  Get well Izzy. Take the time brother you deserve a long rest. A break from it all, including Social etc. Its not like anyone is going to forget you ;)
Thanks Alex for showing this idiot some humility. Izzy wizzy pizzy you won't be missed. The most boring over rated champion to ever hold a belt. What a stupid fuckin jacket thanks Alex for knocking him out.
Alex is your kryptonite
He dare to be gay
4:30 did this foo just say that his flabby titty that everyone was clowning on him for is cancer?
Did he really compare cancer to his gyno breast !!! Ffs Izzy try to be likable at least once in your life
You aren't dealing with Cancer dude. You're a whining bitch. Stop making excuses.
Good sport izzy be humble and progress from the lost
I dont see him being champ ever again. Rob will prolly get next ts and then even if he wins he will prolly win a close dec against gybobender
Izzy has the heart of a champion he put it on the line for an exciting fight. He will be back and he will beat Alex. Just a matter of time. Not to mention the size difference. Izzy has him best the whole fight till the end.
2 Nigerians have been dethroned.. is Francis next? Uh oh lol
Shameful outfit, Israel. After seeing you with that coat I am so happy that Pereira had beaten you. Remember: "the loudest man in the room, is the weakest man in the room"
Who Talkes Better than Izzy, absolutely Nobody. His Interview's, re master class . Swag like a champion everything about him is just a must watch. Ones a champion forever a champion. Israel Adesanya ❤ 🇳🇬 After Conor Mac Gregor Israel Adesanya is the most Paid fighter in UFC. Bruh ain't Nothing better 😂💸💵💶💷💶💲💰.
Humble in defeat like the champ he is!
I don’t ever wanna hear Jon jones and Izzy be compared ever again Izzy clearly was not on Jon’s level when Jon was in his prime
Izzy hit the nail on the head. Casuals need to realise that ppl might have personal things going on behind the scenes. These athletes put EVERYTHING on the line to give us entertainment and we need to respect that.   Those casuals making fun of people are those same casuals you see “showing love” when heart breaking news does come out, pretending to care when X amount of time prior they’re making fun of those ppl.
Y did he take first bottle down someone to help me
Issy is a great fighter but but I’m glad Alex is now the champion. Issy is too scared to truly engage and put his foot on the gas and that’s what cost him in this fight. When you fight a killer like Alex you gotta take him out when you got the chance and not play it safe which also makes most of his fights boring, now we got a new champion who won’t hesitate to put someone’s lights out if he sees the opportunity
Izzy wasn't just trapped along the fence. Alex was purposely trapping him in the corners of the octagon. One of the environmental hazards of the octagon. The cage is literally designed so you have nowhere to go
That jacket is amazing.
So funny and down to earth
I like his authenticity and gratefulness, something very rare nowadays
I knew Dana would wait for the African champs to be dethroned before an event there (n)ever happens
The positive is he does not appear to have permanently injured . He is intelligent and has a bright future.   He was very respectful by giving credit to Alex.    I thank Alex,  I placed money on him winning quite a while ago.  $$$
Great to see you Izzy humility In defeat you were a great Champion. All the best moving forward
My Dreams came True!!! At UFC 281 The Bony Stickman Man Lost His Belt and This Drag  Q👑n  Is Wearing a Fur Coat to His Losing Press Conference and He's Still Trying to Hype Himself Like He Wasn't Hurt 🤛🤜👊😵💤 Dude you got Your Ass!!!!  Pounded  😆😆🥳🎉🎊💥✨🌟⚡💫🤸
Izzy wll demolish Alex in the rematch. No disrespect but he got really lucky there in the end. Regardless, phenomenal performance the both of them.
I think he should have been able to take him out earlier
Hahahahahaha told ya .
Props to Adesanya for taking the fight. Not sure if there is a return fight in the contract  but it would be cool to see. Congratulations to Pereira!!!!
I don’t understand how everyone is saying that that Izzy was dominating the whole fight until he got knocked out cause if you go back and watch it they were going back and fourth exchanging and periera got his fair share of clean shots in and even head kicked Izzy in my opinion it wasn’t as one sided as people were making it out to be
I like him 🙃
HA-HA
“I’m dangerous on the ground” lol stop the cap. He wouldn’t try that on anyone else and he knows it
Damn the Nigerian era is over!!!!!....Kumaru lost now Izzy lost both in the last round daaaamn...and nganou is no where to be seen
salute to Adesanya whether a win or a loss his a man first. Salute
I respect you, you still have that champ status
It sucks that Izzy ain’t the champ but this fight showed Alex and Izzy are human. It also shows that Izzy the overall better fighter and in the rematch izzy will get the victory but it’ll be a decision victory. Alex power matched Izzy’s skill, and Alex weakness is his gas tank and grappling
i think Izzy was up on the score cards  early stoppage no doubt
How big does your ego need to be to compare chad’s cancer death to your pinging nipples fs unles you have cancer don’t compare it
Pure class
Power punchers, like nba players with massive verticals or rugby players with blistering speed…there is no substitute, Izzy Is the consummate professional, he will be back but if not he is still one of the true goats!
I feel like izzy used to be genuine, and lately it's all just smoke in mirrors. I used to be a huge fan but idk man. And comparing yourself to Chadwick bosman... idk
You guys hated on Izzy every single fight. Now you love him? Respect these champs when they rein. These dudes are who you say they are before they lose.. #LastSyleBender #Honor
This talk is rubbish. All champions put it on the line, he's one of the few that believe in anti-action fighting like that. He talks about wanting to be considered one of the greats but believes in avoiding contact as the usual strat, this ain't it.
I reckon Izzy has to overcome the fear he has for Alex’s power..great fight.
Izzy fought like a warrior. I think he had that fight not until the 5th round. Rehydrate and come back stronger champ.
Funny how a lost can put your feet back to earth! This guys is so disrespectful to is opponent those last years,even last night didn’t congratulate the winner at the end . I’m so happy for Pierera he not stole that belt 👑👑👑👑
He freaking had the back Izzy needs submission game ...his submission is zero!!!!!!!!
Eu sou português tourco pelo Alex e todos os brasileiros no UFC,mas o stylbenber e um dos maiores campeões de sempre...mt respeito pelo adesanya
This foo was like fuck it I didn’t buy this wanna be pimp mink coat for nothing ima still get my moneys worth even tho I got knocked tf out🤣🤣
Now we need his own reaction of this fight in his own you tube channel 😂😂😂😂
Really goes to show that power goes a long way in combat sports. In their last 2 fights, Izzy was winning right before the KO's. I was rooting for Alex and I'm ecstatic that he won, but fair fucking play to Izzy. Didn't back down from the challenge, and gave us an amazing fight.   Also, major props to the ref for that brilliant stoppage.
He looks bigger than you, and you are still fresh you are faster and accurate than him
Izzy is probably the greatest middle weight of all time, credit to Perriera for getting the win but Izzy Dominanted that fight but that’s MMA. It ain’t over till it’s over. Alex is a tough though
Izzy could have finished the fight in round 3 when he had pereiras back , he must improve his wrestling and jj,nonetheless pereira is huge and should be in light heavy weight . What a fight
So glad we don't have to see him with his gay frosted tips anymore
Respect to Izzy.  Anyone else would've stalled fighting Pereira.  I hope he got paid well.
Boring fight yet good outcome
You have to admire the lunacy of these MMA lads, you swear they had just come back from war against the Vikings or Genghis Khan, instead of a 25 minute dance against some Brazilian lad?!
Good Izzy...not the end!
Alex is a relentless human being. Is an animal
I'm proud of you adesanya, I feel next time try to finish it within third round
He stopped looking to beat him and started looking to just win, laid off the gas and got beat.
Was his best performance
Nice coat
What a classy dude, big respect for Izzy
The only thing I don’t like about izzy is he tries to hard to be a cool guy
He was out on his feet
Israel your sore looser  you talk Lotta shit you lose to someone better then you  lucky the ref stop the fight ohter wise you probably  get worse. Is over Israel  injoy the money you make it  .good job Alex
Isreal th best
This guyis such a fake person... the ring thewatch the coat everything about him is fake...
So good to see the cocky mfs like Usman and Adesanya get a lesson in humility
The, izzys best fights where against  Robert W and and Kevin gastelum. The rest games and title defenses where just crap. He always was passive trying to keep the distance and win the rounds effortless.  But Alex came to ufc, and kept hitting israel and he can't do anything against. Izzzyy was 🏃‍♂️  like a 🐔.  And he still keeps beating cool and bla bla bla bla.  And I am also so happy that meatball molly lost. I hate her stupid acting.
Bro Izzy was clearly beating him like kamaru has learned I'm sure when your up take it easy don't press defend let the fight go and win
I see a brilliant McAdesanya career here 😉 we are at the beginning 🥰
Man.. One can only imagine what Alex will look like after continuous MMA training 😳. It was clear Izzy was more skilled however there’s no doubt in my mind that all Izzy could think about is being KOd. Probably lived rent free in his mind up until getting TKOd tonight. Sheesh
😂
3-0 against Izzy but it’s a fluke
Izzy a bum, lost 3 times to one man it’s a wrap homie
That coat says it all.
I like izzy but him saying he wouldn't have got knocked down if the ref didn't stop it is just bullshit
Let’s see Robert take on Alex
Bro got humbled 😂
I believe the fight was stopped premature.. would of liked to see Izzy on the mat only saw 1 punch really land all the others were in the air. His head was down the whole time and I believe the ref had only good intention of him not getting ducked up but still wasnt a herb dean stoppage maybe if it was a feather weight fight but these are some big boys his feet were stable Alex was just as tired and worn out just got rocked too should of stopped it when Alex stated folding from the right hand
If the reff wouldn't stop the fight he would go to sleep 100%. Stop being delusional you izzy fanboys.
He’s pure class
Why did he say I got to go to someone else? To a certain  journalist...did I miss something.
🤡🤡🤡
Izzy is what you get if you shave an orangutan’s head  🦧
I’m glad he got KOed if he had lost by decision EVERYONE would say that he won . That’s it Alex f&@ed him up . Izzy LOST
"Izzy the Roadrunner " had nowhere to run
This man is still a champ for me. His professionality is awesome. 🤟🔥❤️
What's his beef with monster energy?
That coat looks comfy asf
Gotta appreciate Adesanya for being active, but if this outcome was the other way around, he would have thrown Alex under the bus...
Adesanya talked so much smack then, Izzy got dizzy and got knocked tf out BAHAHAHA
🤣🤣🤣
Humbled the Prick Hopefully
That female reporter is defo Korgs wife
3-0 thats what i thought..its not luck.numbers never lie..u only good with short with people smh
God damn, did he kill the big foot?
Still the Champion for accepting the defeat. Salute! I know you will come back stronger! There's a lot of chance to hit Alex with the elbow..
He still is the best in my books no matter the outcome, still a real fan! Always!
Whats taht for a clown? Killed animals to wear a fure like a diva, oh man.
If izzy continued grappling he would win the fight
God bless  you brother you are still  on top at list .👌👌👌👍👍👍
Respect Izzy✊🏾…
I though izzy said hes gonna blow the roof off that bitch 🤭
There are always someone better.. accept it..
Izzy will always be amazing. What an amazing champion.
Cap🎩 againn: 1 more Left Stroke from Poatán woulda been the Death Stroke💯 & buddy wouldn't be @ this presser.. & the Cap became cringe when in all the lead-ups, ya 🗣big, & then Under-whelming af.  It's a hard watch as a fan +fighter.    🗿 #MohaganyPoatàn #MakingMiddleweightGreatAgain #MMGA
As has been said, many times and in many ways, another chicken 🐔 neck bites the dust !  😳 😯
Sucks he was winning all 3 fights but this one he was so close to getting the decision
Humble in victory,humble in defeat true champ but Alex is a monster.
Classy in defeat brother. All The respect my man 🔥
That fur coat looks crazy, wonder if it’s a real lion
Israel Chewbaccasania
One one Nigerian left, Ngaunoo vs Jones
When the fur coats come out you know thats when its all over
N😂 your not
The ghost of the past hunted the dizzybender! 💥 💥 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
Gonna be smoking that Elsa pack for a bit
He beat the guy jor... referee called it off too quick
I saw whole fight, Alex stood in front of him and did not let him run, Israel is a runner
Still wont jones haahab
Ya win some and ya lose sum
Same story. Hes faking his emotion.
Congrats to Peirra for winning the cover of ufc 4
At last, he needed a dose of humble.
This is exactly wht happened in other two fights
Israel is done he will never beat this dude.
Props , this dude is a champ
Im very happy u got humbled this time, it was good to see the end of that fight. Because ure so annoying fighting for ur belt the previous time. U just ran in the octogone . 1 more thing, u talking too much
We love you Izzy
I'm just going to say what everyone thinking The fix was in.
They should make this a Trilogy in the UFC, Like 3 Fights-
rite now is all talk and fake just give it a few days the excuse will start to come out like always
Wtf is he wearing ? 🤣🤣🤣🤡
I'd a let Izzy go out on his shield, not standing ko...
Man the media sucks his balls a lot with their questions and compliments lol
So happy to see him KO'D still an arrogant, superior to everyone ASS!! way he speaks to everyone disgusts me! Not an inche of humility!!
Israel pulled an Ivan Drago!!! Lopsided beatdown, all he had to do was not get knocked out in the last round. He goes out and gets his ass Koed.
You know what let alex fight another person if he  last izzy  will fight that person cuz of his efort
Maybe if he fucked Alexs' head up as much as his 'leg'  izzy would still be ruining the middleweight division
he has lost 2 fights against Alex in kick boxing knowing it was a really risky fight. He still wanted it. I can't wait until they fight again I reckon these 2 will have a lot more fights
True champ, does a post-fight presser even after losing the belt 👏👏👏 by the way early stoppage by Mark Goddard screw him Izzy was still moving showing he was aware
I’m sorry Izzy, you’re a champ but you were NOT going to recover from that lol. 💯
Alex is only going to train and get better. He went 4 full rounds and KOed him in the 5th round. IZZY WILL NEVER TOUCH THAT BELT WITH ALEX IN THE UFC
what do u expect when you only fight by running
This made my year, fuxkin modern day Floyd mayweatjer keep running bitch
Respect for A real champion can take a defeat with the greatest humble man
His leg 🤣🤣 his fucking brain is what shut down and got the fight stopped
Mark NotsoGoddard is a terrible ref. No more championship matches for Mark. The man should ref the prelims.
I hope that's not a real fir.
You'll return better bro. I trust u
If the fight was not  stopped you would be in hospital now.
Guy said he doesn't want Alex to make excuses and now hid made 20 excuses lol
Lmao the new king of cringe
Is Steven Mazagatti supposed to be Mario Yamasaki? 😂
watching adesanya fight is like watching a piece of art watching periera fight is like watching a predator stalk his prey
I had this weird feeling Izzy was gonna lose the fight in the 5th round when I heard Alex corner talking to him, they said EVERYTHING Alex needed to hear in that moment, they give him great advice and got his head refocused for that K.O in the 5th. What a fight tho, Izzy really could of had him in the 1st if he had 5 more seconds 😔 Gutted for him, I do still believe Izzy can beat him,  but Alex power is always going to be dangerous, he was lethal and so precise with his finishing punches. Still cemented as an all time great tho, and has plenty of fight still in him, he'll be back no doubt!!!  💯
I LOVE ALEX 😂😂❤️🇧🇷
Not a fan of izzy, but he spoke respectfully,, unlucky...
Ego is to dangerous, there’s always somebody stronger, badder, faster and better than you. Just let it go bro, you are fighting not to show your pain right now. It’s sad.  That guy is your LIMIT 🔥
Izzy Probly 4million for the loss,hopefully he comes back👊🏾💯
I knew what happened to Izzy. Same happened to Usman. A simple fight you have almost won, you allowed the belt slipped out of your hands like that, what an uncalculated error
Izzy will be back !!!
Did Izzy bring that dark energy 😂, glad he lost, far too arrogant
Mad respect for style bender he showed all the skills but got tagged.  Shit happens
You could see your shoes quite well as your head was pummeled with punches.   Nice, im trying too hard jacket.
Adesanya 💅 💅 💅 💅 💅
Earlier stoppage mf ufc refree
He cry baby he got about 10 dogs to head head was going 90
Israel ur good bro man respect bro its not that
Izzy went for takedowns as desperation and showed us why he never does them.
Well done both fighters, You’re still a soy boi Izzy! But great bout lads
Hé needs khabib for the grappling
The dress of the fox from Naruto xD
He should of jus wrestled last round. Even if he had of lost that round wrestling , he would of won. Like there's a reason why you go against the fence because your afraid of his power. He froze last round
The thumbnail looking like Israel is having a Orang-Utan’s body with a human head.
Now Alex is the champ. He can sit back and let his opponents walk into his traps.
Pereira has his number. He had him nervous this week and during the fight. Sorry but Izzy would lose against him 9 out of 10 times because he can’t deal with his pressure. He turned him into a grappler
Nobody talkn bout you're team. Be humble suck it up. You're not that great bruh. And the whole orangutan outfit?? Na g.
Alex is a flump he doesn't deserve that win he was so shit all fight , his style sucks
Frozen like Elsa
So glad to see this ball fondler lose. He got slept twice, time to shut up and stop being so slimy when he loses. He just seems like such a waffle.
Why does he get such bad wind? I'm not seeing him drinking energy drinks but he might have a special drink he takes to replenish all his nutrients?
Needs to start fighting with his hands up. Respect the opponents power. Also needs some serious work on his ground game
If I got 100 dollar for every time he said "fuck"...my yearly rent would be sorted.
He’ll be back 💯🔥💯
Excellent outcome.  Adesanya is boring to watch.
With or without a belt, this man is a champion.
i cant stand adesanya when he dance after win but now feel sorry
This guy is a real fighter. After a war like this, he comes here and answer to those stupid questions. Very class.
Still the Best
I personally didn’t think the stoppage was needed, Izzy looked fine to me. I’ve gotten punched in the jaw and all it did was blink my eyes and stumble me barely. I was still lucid as well but I get how it can look bad to the ref. Should’ve been more aggressive too, Izzy played patty cake way to much. Should’ve had him submitted in the third round
It was your chin buddy
Pereira is Adesanya's kryptonite and Adesanya is Whittaker's Kryptonite, however I think Whittaker beats Pereira based on wrestling and teep kicks, Adesanya had openings for those kneebreakers.  *Edit: He just needs to avoid those TNT hands.
Class act for remembering most of the media peoples names lot of disrespectful questions fired his way aswell
3x0
Izzy you are a champ, in and out
That is one hell of a coat
I was rooting for Alex but after this fight I fell in a rematch Izzy will take it. He almost had it in the bag but them power punches were to hard to escape from. I feel they’ll go back, review the fight and come up with a plan to avoid it
Sean Strickland Vs Israel Adesanya. Is the fight to make.  (That press conference would be insanely good, and both recently lost to Alex Periera)
What the heck u wearing
Fights like these show us how entertainment and playing cautious and winning fights have the potential to yield completely different results, respect to him for handling the loss in good spirit.
Adesanya fough Alex like a man won 3 rounds and went out on his shield what else can you ask from him
Does anyone else find Izzy talking about his health issues and referencing Chadwick Bozeman quite concerning? It’s actually the second time I’ve heard him make that comparison around what is going on with his chest. Surely if it was something very serious he wouldn’t be cleared to fight? I really hope he’s ok.
Homie aint got no bruises on his face but somehow still got k'oed 💀
Just love Izzy! A class act!
Stoppage was good , more time means more damage , cuz he was hands down taking blows on head
What did he say about Jon Jones?
I respect Israel so much... but styles make matches... just like rampage always had ice man's number..
How gangster is that coat 😎👌
Great fight. Congrats to the new champ.    Sucks it seemed Adesanya was lowering his guard after each round. He criticised Strickland playing “pitty pat” with pereira hands but started doing it too. Around Round 3 and onward he started trying to pull Anderson Silva swaying and the downfall began..pereira got confident after landing some punches and he was away other than that he was looking stunned and highly guarded like the other fights Adesanya had won by Dec.
when izzy use pearl neckless, i know he goin down path being a soyboy
Furcoat, pearl necklace and painted fingernails, throw in a black eye, the gift to gab and you have all the hallmarks of a high class hooker.
Alex should reign at 205 now.
This is Izzy’s GSP career defining moment. The rematch is going to be interesting.
Needed humbling
Why is he wearing an orangatang
Is good 2 see izzy in LHW jd probably never gon be champ. But if he fights guys with similiar height hes 0-2 at UFC but they have been good fights.I wanna see competitive fights.
This is what you get. Izzy wanted a horror movie, and the black guy never wins in a horror movie. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why's he wearing an Orangutan costume
This is a real champ. Usman and Adesanya have lost the battle, but they still have a war to win. I'm pumped for the future of these new champs, and the come back fights!?!?!? Come on!!! LFG!!!
This rlly is a shock to all of us, but Israel energy is amazing he can bounce back from this loss and go for the rematch hopefully
Good fight!  It's not over!  Let's gooooo
I’m not a big Izzy fan but that was a terrible stoppage he should get a rematch.
Unlucky great fight Champ love your energy
This is the beginning of a great Trilogy
He was going good n winning ,but again , same stuff from glory , he was doing good when attacking , he got more defensive at the end
Might argue early stoppage but it helps Izzy that it was stopped then, he had his head down low..a knee may have knocked him out cold and that can damage you permanently
Humble pie, humble pie!!!
I know he got defeated, but why making it more painful and cringy by looking like a rich black lady with that hyenas coat.
U were not lucid izzy u were staring at the floor taking punches and the ref saved u from getting sent to the shadow realm
So happy to see him lose
Man give Alex his dues.3 fights with Izzy & he got a KO & TKO against Izzy.Like Izzy is the best thing since sliced bread.All I gots to say is "Come on down Bobby Knuckles".He should get 1st crack at Alex.Izzy can fight Bones & everyone's happy.You only as good as your last fight.Win your next one lad & you fight the winner.
Come on  stop wearing animal fur man
once meatball molly gave him that everton shirt, its all but over for izzy 😅
Wow izzy happy that a loss doesnt break you champ! I swear i was so impressed with your boxing in this fight so i am signing up for boxing on my local club tomorrow champ. I even saw you in my dream and you did apperciate this
Lucid Dream
“Best performance” leg kicking and jabbing
Some people are already saying early stoppage and robbery on other channels. THAT talk is ridiculous IZZY now even admits in his latest interview on ESPN MMA that the stoppage was a good stoppage. Izzy's own corner aggrees with the stoppage and now after watching it so does Izzy Another clean shot from Alex would of separated Izzy from his consciousness. Im an Izzy fan and lost money last night  but stop being in denial  "all this robbery early stoppage" going out on your shield can take years off your life.
I think a rematch is still necessary adesanya mostly outstriked perreira
This arrogant fool, thinks he would have stayed in the fight if Mazagati hadn't stopped it. Boy, you would have left on a stretcher if he hadn't!! He saved you!! The better fighter won 3 times.
team israel all the way💪🏿💪🏿!
I’ve never been a big fan of Izzy outside the cage but seeing how he takes a loss(in his own division) is making me like him more. Also, he looks like a bear lol.
Periera is a beast
love u bro
I belive that wrestling made him tired , toghter with calf kicks and body kicks . But all toghter it was amazing performance from Izzy till the knockout.
Wtf is he doing with that stupid fur
Prevent defenses never work...
Is he back to normal? His look is far better compared the one before the fight. It's like all the burden is gone. Honestly even if he lost this time, his performance is better than 4-5 of his previously performances.
He can’t promote his fights or speak any English language so they will suffer big problems ufc
Too early. Give the champ a chance to scramble, which he was doing. Too early imo.
He didn’t put shit on the line
Annoying fact in MMA is weight cheating which has to stop. Pereira is obviously LHW or even HW however he is able to cut the weight drastically before the scales. Fair play to him he is using what is allowed however this thing has to stop. In this fight they say he was weighing 215, 220 pounds and the size difference was obvious to see. Take nothing away from him he won fair and square however this weight cutting has to stop, its been going on for so long, it's dangerois and it's not fair. Back on the day fighters like Wanderlei , Crocop, Rampage, Fedor, Bas, Randleman would never do this. They've would fight in their own natural weight class
Total gentleman. Great diplomat for the UFC. Big Issy fan. Colby Cuntington could learn something from this guy.
pwussy neega🤡
Respect for the comment about gyno
cant believe Alex fitted in 83kg division for his size😮
I’m glad he got knocked out idc what y’all say😂
Sometimes u win when u lose it's all about tha lesson keep pounding.kings up .
So many greats have been in this moment before. You lose the belt after holding the division in your palm for years. Gotta sit back and reflect on the greatness but also get to the top again
Did he have a manicure and pedicure before the fight? Fruitcake that he is.
Feel for izzy. Still a legend and still on my  wallpaper 🙏
The fight would still be on at this moment if Mario Yamasaki was the referee.
Izzy is a Real Champ.... So casual and cool after a disastrous loss! Alex really is his kryptonite.  Kudos to Alex.... Seriously dangerous at close range. Some fresh breath in the division.
They could fight 100 times Alex would win every time fr
Ngannou will be next.
Top man
Wow Pierre was just one level above him . Poor adsenya and Pierre they well easy fall to khamzat
U can't beat him dude .just except it
🤡🤡
Wow they give him nasty 4 ph aquafina water rofl.
alex really does have hands of stone
Looking like Whitney Houston after Bobby beat that ass boy nice coat
He will not reign forever. At least he beat someone to become a champ, someone else will also do same to him to become a champ too. We are humans not robots.
Pereira is living absolutely rent free in Izzy's head....forever! Can't wait to hear the excuses. Hopefully he learns some humility but I doubt it.
Can’t stand you! Honestly, great athlete with a disgusting personality
His head was bobbing side to side like a zombie, he was out looking at the floor lol The ref saved him from going out unconscious tbh.  I had it 2-2 going into the 5th.  As I said, if he fights vs a high caliber striker such as Alex or even Romer= he would get exposed somewhat.  And izzy hurt his leg when Alex checked that kick.  Alex is made out of stone lol
Izzy tried everything to beat the man he could never beat lmao held onto him for dear life! And still choked smh turned izzy into a grappler into Marvin vettori 😭
People saying early stoppage needs to realise that he was hurt.. Like badly hurt and one clean punch would have put the lights out and his face would he the target for thw memes
i think izzy is bigfoot
Look like a licorice strip in a Orangutan costume 😆
He's got Izzy's number.. Simple as that. Great performance from him but Alex is his boogeyman
You can't say your leg caused that in the 5th round... Lol 😂🤣💦
Not humbled still. One the most annoying fighters to listen to. Black version of McChicken
He tried to make it a boring fight and get a decision again, but he got slept. The funny part is that he tried to wrestle, I ques it's not that easy playing kickboxing with an actual kickboxer who is the same size as you
Izzy is going through the Anthony Joshua phase
Respect
I love this dude. Win or lose. Never been a fan of this boy until tonight.
Good performance by Izzy, my brother you got plenty to come, and love and respect to my Brother in Islam Pereira and New….
Give us U.F.C Africa in Nigeria. Usman-Leon rematch and Izzy-pereira rematch co-headliners
History repeats its self
He has his number lololol woooooooooo
Lose is lose mate 😂
He still sleepy from the kick
Gutted by this result. If there isn't an immediate rematch Khamshot will move up and take the belt easily which could be a good thing for Izzy.
Izzy will be champ again
He will beat him in the rematch. He's a superior fighter BUT anytime u have 2 men who are professional fighters, it only takes a punch or 2, he just got caught, we all saw him dominate the fight. Just got caught period , I think he absolutely wins next fight
He stayed wayyyy too long near the fence he should’ve did the hand thing n bring him to the middle
He got white-washed just as his coach eugene wished for
Cocky talk talk ..excuses n shit You just can't beat Alex.. he stronger than you 💪🏻.. you know u don't want that rematch 😆3-0
Cool guy right. Could have left off with the stoppage doubts but.
Still no love for Monster energy 🤣
Fucking yeah...Finally someone whooped his ass, he was never a fighting champ always trying to hold onto the title never fight for people's
Big head got done hahaha 😂
I am also proud of you …you are champion for me , Alex didn’t proved nothing special this night to be champion
Izzy is still d champ any day, anytime, Alex don't deserve d belt for many reasons, any adesanya fight is always a sold out fight, can Alex sell half of adesanya fight? Pls champ gets ur belt back bcuz I know even Dana White is not happy
I'm glad Izzy lost the belt it was the best outcome.. them punches must of done some serious damage for man to be sat here dressed like an orangutan
I put £100 on the right guy 🔥
My guy is wearing a lions coat literally
Shocking Izzy fought like the challenger. Should have bulk up a bit. Sad for him to loss it this last moments
I think alex loses to anybody else in that position, its the fact he saw izzy and is so confident that he owns him that he kept going.
he has izzys number..
What makes Izzy special is that he can hold that top spot against well rounded and even grapple heavy opponents, Pereira will most likely lose to Vetori or Rob in the future just because of his lack of grapple defence.
he was winning that fight then he got frozen like Elsa still the champ in my book
Bte ufc 281 was one of the best card in history.. As a mma fans this was one of my saddest day edgar loss to his farewell fight, chandler loss, esparza loss and izzy.
I'm not the biggest Issy fan but he is handling this loss like an absolute legend.
Your truly looking at the best and it shows just because your the best doesn’t mean you always win
Don’t compare yourself to a guy who died from cancer if you don’t have cancer… simple as that to me
Frozen like elsa😂
Great fight. Chin up Izzy. Rematch will be next. Congrats to Periera on a huge win
Yeah well all those foxes loss more than you.....blah blah blah
What a bad ref. I was euiting against izzy but give me a break.
Is izzy going to keep fighting this guy till he wins its literally 3 0 does he need 3 or 4 fights just to prove his better
Izzy has to change if he's going to beat Alex.   Izzy can beat him on score cards. He always has. But Alex just takes the judges out of it.   Izzy needs to train in wrestling. He needs to add to his."style bending" if he hopes to solve Alex.
Fucking Izzy got humbled 😂😂
Much love izzy we know you will be back.....
Izzy Mcg fan
@6:06 "same thing as last time" might as well just admit he is the better fighter at that point instead of blaming it on legs and refs
We proud of u g just a bump in the road
4 fight Izzy time
In 5th i said and hoping that a deja vu in usman fight would not happen but thats it he got caught cant finish the homerun like usman.. Ngannou next for the heavyweight 😢
Props to Alex for stopping his attack when he saw the ref coming rather than when he was between them.
If you were so lucid dude then why were you looking at the floor when the ref stopped the fight? The ref should have let Alex clean you up because there was no way your lights were gonna stay on 🤭
non izzy fan but after tonights performance much respect,  banger and took the loss like a boss
Win or loos izzy is my fav.he lost caz he injurred his leg
For me its not an early stopage. watch the ref it is the perfect timing to stop the fight. watch the ref stops the left upercut that would hit adesanya if it lands for sure adesanya will be koed again
Keep your head high, you were a great champion and you can be a great champion again, the perfect example is on the same card in Weili Zhang. Congratulations to Alex, he is a beast.
Izzy fans so salty.
That Jacket though…
He will never beat Pereira.
delusion is strong...
Could have been better seeing him unconscious. But this will do I suppose
Great display of personality by Adesanya in this interview! Respect
The better fighter won period
Stop being arrogant bro, reality is you have a weak chin plus the only thing you do is hit n run. Hard boxer needs only one punch n that’s what pareire has
I was surprised of the every part of the size of Alex Pereira. That guy was born to fight. His scary gaze shows how much he made efforts to get outta favela
It was a fair stoppage he was out on his feet. But referee avoid more brain damage
The two Nigerian Usman & Alex have both lost who thought this would happen in 2022
Wants immediate rematch, doesn’t give Whittaker the same respect.  Back of the line bro, get what you give.
If you didnt know the outcome of the fight, you would think he actually won the fight from this post fight press conference, Izzy's mentality is really great.
Thanks for the easy money
That ref saved his senses! Yeah your eyes were  rolling back a little and you were lucid. More like you were in la la land bud, bout to get knocked the fuck out!!🤣🤣.. If the ref would've let that go for another 30 seconds, Issy would have been talking a dirt nap.  Would've not been given the opportunity to wear his pretty fur and talking all that smack. 😂 Now just imagine if he would have fought Jon Jones, it would have been a slaughter!  Jon don't play,, mannn I miss Johnny Bones!! ✊
Nothing to be ashamed of. Fought a good fight until the unfortunate end.
The steroid use made me cheer for Pereira, apart from that I like the guy and his skills, awesome fight
He lost but he won.                                      Like here  👇
Izzy gonna win in their 2nd encounter.. however Jon Jones is happy now
“Frozen like Elsa”🥶❄️☃️
You’ll be back even stronger and better than ever. Keep your chin up my man!
Bring back Steve Mazzagatti 🤣
You can see Izzy just can't handle the size and power! I'm a huge Izzy fan and I saw the nerves from day 1, actually saw it the day he did a YouTube reaction to his 1st ufc fight
المغرور دائما يموت مغرور
Still one of my favorite fighters belt or not
Imagine talking about a rematch with a guy you've lost to 3 times in a row after he knocked you out for the second time and you're wearing that coat
This guy is a real champ win or lose. We love Izzy, much respect.
You still the greatest.  Thank you very much.  Hope to see you soon.
I Love when "humbleness" is served in the slice of a pie. IZZY, HUMBLE YASELF!!! (and now he compares himself to the Black Panther. Thanks Francis,and, Usman!) LOL
Even in defeat still arrogant
😂😂😂😂 yoel wud have done the same if u wudnt run
Whatever animal he’s wearing there wants a rematch 😅
RESPECT.
I hope he’s not saying he has cancer yo
Gastelum was way more hurt than Izzy, Frankie vs gray Maynard, I can think of 100 other examples. Early stoppage especially for a title fight
Man, I don't know why people don't talk about it..... His MMA game revolves around I touch you, and you can't touch me becoz I am tall....  The moment his reach is not helping him and its hard to stay away from punches he is in trouble....  This fight his reach wasn't helping him, he was getting kicked back every time he was kicking....and boom he lost the fight....  All his previous fights he just used his height as a tool and for the first time he couldn't use it....  Plus he had a very strong puncher infront of him..  When the going gets tough, bitches give up!
The cold never bothered me anyway❄️
Alex 3 Izzy 0
Imagine Jones KOs Francis in round 5 and they do Jones Ngannou 2, Pereira Adesanya 2, Edwards Usman 3 on UFC Africa
About time Izzy fought someone the same height and length hahah u suck Izzy 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
3-0 already...peirera gonna beat ur ass again🤣🤣🤣
I feel for him so unfortunate the second time. Alex is obviously bigger and hard puncher and should be fighting in  heavier divisions he stave himself just to meet weigh. So unfair for izzy
Kia kaha brother izzy, u looked phenomenal tonight, unlucky that 1st round wasn't 10 seconds longer, alex was doing the midnight oil dance, can't wait to see you back in the cage my bro, full credit to Alex can't wait for the rematch 😀 👏 👍
What sort of ridiculous crap is this fool waring? Did he forget the hat to his pimp suit?
Some guys just have your #
Gay fook
That was one of the most tense and nerve-wracking fights of late, Pereira is a scary dude
İzzy sayin I'm dangerous on the ground is like Tony Ferguson saying I'm technical with my striking.
Keep ur head up champ. Rest up and ul be back
Israel lost it in every way!! He still thinks he will win in a rematch 😂😂 hey Israel you were fucked very good and that is 3-0 if you longing for 4-0 try it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The fight game is crazy. Have to respect how he handled this loss. Glad to see a new champ, I would say it will shake up the division, but UFC will do an immediate rematch. Alex needs to beat him again to actually shake things  up. 🤦‍♂️
3:0…
Hot take but I thought the stoppage was early. He was still moving, just got a little wobbly
If he just came out as a practicing homosexual he would be so much happier
That orangutan looks like Izzy!
Props to Adesanya for getting his ass beat.hes the man.
He needed to be humbled just like Usman, when you talk too much sh1t you get humbled real quick.
Izzy needs to work on some ground game ❣
IZZY FROZEN LIKE ELSA
Pereira put Adesanya in big dark forest .... What a tremendous punch power... The strategy "a la Usain Bolt" didn't work at all...
The defeat is really incredible... Pereira is really the real Warrior....
People that have never trained a day in their lives are saying what he should’ve done. He couldn’t move properly in the 5th because his legs were finished and his body was eating so many shots. He couldn’t evade anymore and then boom
ALEX WAS READY TO KNEE YOUR FUCKING HEAD INTO NOSE BLEED SECTION IF THE FIGHT WASN'T STOP RIGHT THEN AND THERE. IT'S NICE TO HAS ALPHA HAS CHAMP ONCE AGAIN INSTEAD OF SOME CLOSET HOMOSEXUAL.
Early stoppage
Respect for the former Champ..i'm looking forward to the rematch.
Izzy is my guy!
Adesanya is an assasin but alex is a berserker haha the more health he loses the more strength he gains.
Graceful loser, amazing champion. Head up Izzy, get that fucking belt in the rematch.
Respect to izzy second best middleweight of all time after silva and second longest run as champion.
Adesanya seemed punch drunk.
Two L’s tonight with that coat smh
this N just getting humble hahaha
The definition of nemesis.
Join the bench with Usman 😉 Cocky fighters
sounds like he’s relieved to have lost the belt
Glad the foul mouth lost again. Well done to Alex👋👋👋
Such a undeserving loss . Ref should had let him continue a little longer to see if he would change position. It’s sad that they stop a fight like that when it’s the champ we talking about
Forever a "low key" fan of Adesanya.   He is amazing as a person, athlete, and entertainer.  I've never been a hater, not once.  But I was never really a fan of his.  I always wanted someone to beat him.  But this fight I wanted him to win.  I said this many times before the fight.  But also, I knew like everyone else knew, Periera will probably win.  He's a savage beast....but Adesanya made him look amateur.  I've always been a huge fan of the Brazilians.  Never hated Adesanya but I wasn't ever a fan either.   This guy is classy asf after watching his entire journey the last 5 years.  I'll be back for the rematch as a full blown fan and cheering for his title recovery.
Lost 200 but hope you recover izzy
Izzy I love you champ 🐐✍️
I respect his humility and honesty, much respect for this interview after that knockout too.
Maybe he lost and there's new champ, but he's still my favourite fighter. ✊
How many Labs died for that Coat?
Champion even in defeat.
Izzy is dumb, he should of never listened to toxic ufc haters. His coach is shit aswell and he should of done what he always does. Oh well thats what you get izzy for listening to haters who cant fight for shit. Lol
Im glad you lost lmao 🤣!  No rematch fight Strickland.
Props to ozzy he could of clenched and got a easy victory but he went for the glory
He lost that fight the same way his past history with this guy. Got lucky frfr
it's BS ppl still think it's fluke & didn't respect Alex.imagine if Alex punch izzy on buzzer 💀but it's izzy so nobody takes about it.
Massive class.
Alex look like he's from light heavyweight
Very classy in defeat
well done  lots of love
🙂
Thats what Happens when you cant Run round the octagon
He outstrikes Alex in all their fights but then gets finished I feel like getting hit by Alex and taking the punch changes later on in the fight he's got one of the most dangerous hits iv ever seen some of them must be delayed aswell izzy looked good til Round 4 n 5
Izzy cooked the dinner (worked for UFC championship). Alex ate it 😂😂🤣🤣
Come on izzy if the ref didn’t stop u were gona get killed
Israel wasn’t even trying to win
Come on izzy if the ref didn’t stop u were gona get killed
Elsa got frozen
This series is out of 7 obv Izzy has to make a come back! Imagine lol that would go down in history with this comment
Glad he lost . His last fight stunk the place out ! Still cocky 😫 never learn
The real Champ ! Accept the lose as a man ! He will Come back !!!! Love Or Hate him he is different Great Performance 💯
Taking it like a man...respect!...but the ref saved him from possible knees REALLY doing some damage...rematch will be epic!
If a lion and a orangutan came together to make the perfect coat.  That's it.  Looks awesome !
Just like I was happy all this days he won, I must be here and be sad that he lost. I choose to stand for something. I will always stand with ADESANYA.
I glad perrera won and dethroned izzy but boy that was a bad stoppage lol
Finally. No more cringey punch lines for sometime. The world is becoming better again.
We have another Muslim champ Alex
Hit them weights IZZY, put on about 10 or 15lbs of muscle.  Will help you fight these 220lb weight bullies more
Izzy needs to take some time off and clear his head. He has become too insulated in NZ, he reads too much online critique and not living enough outside his bubble. It's catching up with him on a mental level. He speaks about haters, journalists, media, kids these days, conservative politics. He's losing the spark he used to have. He's got his entire friend group and family counting on him, the dude needs a break and some clarity for himself.
Very humble in defeat. The way treats the reporters  tells you how genuine he is as a person.
He zigged wen he shoulda zagged thats the game they play thats a winnable fight for izzy fasho he’ll run it back and get the dub!
Absolutely delusional, he was going to get knocked out, Alex literally had him where he wanted, the only reason why he had to fight was cause of Alex pressuring him in the ring. Alex did not let him run around like he does with others. He got beat fair and square, so many annoying simp losers in the comments saying hes humble and shit gtfo, he is one of the most annoying, cocky, victory lapping tool in mma history, and Alex came in and shut him the fuck up AGAIN, he never acted like a champion.   Goodjob being a bully all these years, now you got your own.
And new 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Alex hardly threw punches and still stopped sissy, sorry izzy
Gutted Izzy lost, he’s a real good guy & martial artist
I’m grateful that you loss too Izzy
Why he hide the monster drink?
Incoming mma veterans and experts on comments section
Go home and cry homegirl
Isarel is our Champion
I did say this if Izzy wasn’t careful he could be in trouble. He should of ran the clock down knowing he was coming. Kind of let his foot of the gas like usman and got slept
Let's go! AND NEW!
1.52min He farted
Watching their  zero skill grappling is so funny....Izzy and Alex show that they Alway belong to  kick Boxing....What strike from both fighters
Son of a bitch still Comes out lookin gay
Look at this guy now...EVIL
Lol that coat lol 😂 does look quite so cool as a loser! That was a flop
Hats off to him, true gentleman and professional.
Bs stoppage. We literally watched chandler get his face caved in two fights before this and they let him fight and he won the next round.
Tes nul dalsim
He's l you ost   3 times  to this guy  You want 4 really  This girl  Kiwi  Never  seen 4 times  Ever  What's
Sad to see izzy,,,get tko.....ref saved him from getting brain damage
He looks ridiculous
Shot up!! Close your mouth and go home!!! 3-0
Lucid ...? he looked like the Coyote after one of his roadrunner traps backfired
Rematch is on!  Adesanya is a warrior.
John bone jones the goat 🐐 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pereira was 211lb and adesanya still won the rounds
You can run and dodge in any fight with a power puncher but eventually u will get caught.
Pereira is really this man's kryptonite. Smh
The difference was in the mindset ideally. Adesanya was fighting not to loose because of the previous losses he has had with his opponent; while Pereira was fighting to win that's why he took his time to take out his opponent technically, he was the underdog.
Everytime someone talk shit about jon jones they get there ass whipped them ufc gods are real
Man, 2 KOs and people still say he "just got caught" or that it was a fluke. Just accept that the dude got knocked out. It doesnt matter if he's winning the fight on the score cards, if you ELIMINATE the score cards out of the equation. Which is exactly what Alex did twice now. I have always said it. Izzy is only this good because of his size compared to the other middle weights, he fought Alex and Jan. And the outcome was different.
Izzy a great fighter, thanks good Refree has cut in time 👍
Fuck feel for him so bad also thought it was early stoppage.
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk cry kkkkkkkkkkkkk
Can't wait to see him back. Ws and Ls are part of the game.
Maybe if there were weight cutting guidelines to enforce fighters to fight competitors of same weight, not a professional weight cutters who is naturally 50+lbs heavier.
it's good to see you humbled for a while 🤣🤣🤣
❤👏👏👏❤
Khamzat will destroy both easy money...
I had the feeling that Alex was recovered after not throwing at all in the 4th.
im a top notch hater on this guy and voted for him to lose but he showed up/showed off tonight and is graceful in defeat and i respect that as much as his abilities the hate ends today
The nerd went down as expected
I was watching this in the bar and let me tell you when Izzy lost not a single person clapped. The whole bar was dissapointed, just silent. Never seen that before. Keep working hard Izzy, respect from Canada.
Fuck this guy. Time for a new Era. Feed him to Jon Jones.
Izzy is a champ. He gets so much hate for nothing.  Things just got very interesting!!!
Frozen like Elsa
alex is your cryptonite madafaka
Izzy is corny
Jon Jones will smoke this fool
I honestly didn't mind Izzy's fighting style and he's a good dude. But he needed a reality check, his trash talk was cringey as fuck and didn't fit his style at all. People didn't have a problem with his "boring fights" they had a problem with him making all these promises of "demolishing his opponent" and by the end of the fight his opponent only looks tired... Don't talk about "killing your opponent" if you wont do it. This mentality is what lost him this fight. He wasn't focused on finishing Alex and if he was he probably would have won.
Damn, that’s a badass coat Izzy!
Izzy still 1 of my favorites no matter what...but Pereira is my man.  Nice fight going equally but Izzy had more finesse Pereira the power and healing power cuz he was rocked good in the 1st round. Great fight great card!
K1 fans 🤫😂😂😂😂
Frozen like Elsa
Great fight!!! I love how Izzy responds to losses and puts things in perspective. I do think 5 to 10 more seconds in the first, Izzy wins. Congratulations to the new champ!
He deserves to loose just for that coat
That checked kick was the turning point
Izzy looking like he skinned a grizzly bear before he came on set🤣
Bruh Pereira looked massive. Why don't they just weigh in right before stepping in the arena and avoid weight advantages
If his chin was exposed in one sport it was only a matter of time before someone exposed it again.
Still one of my favorite fighters. 🇳🇬 🇳🇿
He is shitting in his pants
He sounds like he doesn't want to fight him again , but don't know how to say no
this blm protester has a lot of weird bs!
There are actually new insulation materials nowadays GoVegan!
He was out on his feet
Man I wish he would've won that sucks!
Casuals;  compare how this class act accepts defeat with the way Rowdy Rhonda Rousey does.   And then respect his greatness.    Casuals!
First time he fought someone the same height and same reach...so...
Bruh 3-0 no story he’s the better always gonna be the better men eat your humble pie
alex did say one thing he was going to make izzy fight and that he did
Damn I respect Izzy so much more after seeing this interview. Gotta respect someone who loses like that and then doesn't hang his head and keeps a positive attitude.
Now imagine if Israel had a powerful punch like Alex and with his skills.... Alex used what he had and it worked for him. Poor Israel wasn't lucky enough
Still king.  Keep up the energy.  Even if it hurts.  Show your people who’s the leader
Hearing DC commentating had me mad. No wonder why many top fighters hate him as commentator. Bias!!!
Fantastic example of how to conduct yourself after a big loss 👍 What a guy Izzy
this blm protester is  full of bs!
No wonder jon jones dismissed his taunts so easily...jones would of decimated him.......great fight but pereira has izzy number
Im starting the Rehire Steve Mazzagati Petition Yo🙋
Respect
HE  TRY  HIS  BEST  2  LOOK  COOL , AND  HE  DID  WELL  ,  BUT  BELIEVE  ME  HE  IS  HURT  &  ANGRY  INSIDE....I  DON'T  THINK  HE  WILL  EVER  BEAT  THIS  PEREIRA ...
He had everthing to win, everything, the fight was 100% under control, but....surprise came to pay him a visit.  I remember Kamaru vs Edwards fight.....
Took the loss well and I like Izzy, though he says what went wrong in the fight was his foot hurt and that he was 100% in the fight when it was stopped, I mean what really went wrong was getting clipped and hit clean like 10 times from Alex and if the fight had gone on for another 5 seconds then Israel was about to eat a knee or get hit clean again with another 4-5 hooks to the head, he wasn't really in it at the end he was literally looking straight down and mindlessly weaving sideways and Alex was hitting him each time he was moving left and right
i love how honest Izzy is. He said he was still there but his team told him it was a good stoppage and he is ok with it because he trusts them. True champ, true professional. Will always be a fan. That said, also a long time fan of Alex Pereira and so happy for him.
Izzy should've just let it go in that moment. 🤦🏻‍♂️ If it was a time to slug it out... That was it. Disappointed.
I had izzy way ahead he should of danced around in the 5th it was already in the bag he wobbled alex bad and should have pressed
And Elsa was frozen
He talking about gyno
Chewbacca lookin mofo
Alex is a machine good chin good recovery good patience and physically imposing and power for days if he works more on grappling gonna be hard to beat
He's a great fighter but Alex is his achilles heel. There's always that 1 guy that got your number
Man I wanna see Izzy get a better ground game .  It really could have helped here .   Oh well style bender coming up again
alex is like shao khan, where you hit him and it does nothing and he just regenerates fast and comes foward at you!
Glad the clown 🤡 lost 😭🤣😭 go home and cry
how does he know every reporter's name?
Alex 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥇🥇🥇🥇🏆🏆🏆🏆👍👍👍👍🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Next time he will be sleep
Hype train derailed 😂 Adesanya sucks and Pereira OWNS him
Dana red thinking 2 down 1 more left to go
Alex is gonna follow Izzy to the nursing home lol.
Izzy is a chump not champ
🤡🤡🤡
Like the way he removed the mainstream sugar drinking bottle for the water bottle 👏👏👏
Alex was lucky he got rocked at the end of first round saved by the ding. In saying that Alex is a beast , izzy is still the man.
Stand up for the NZ Farmers
Bro making injury excuses already lol... 0-3 why should there be a rematch???
He tryna pull a Kamaru usman
Alex just did a good job... izzy keeping it real. He fought the best he could and was beat at the end of the day. Hats off to both fighters
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 cringe ass adesanya losses AGAIN. Good riddance.
I'd rather see khamzat vs Alex instead of a rematch
Homegirl got humbled big TIME. Ought to keep that purty mouth shut for a few hours now. Jan and Alex gotchu boy. Go do your nails now and enjoy your cartoons lol sucka#POATAN
man porreirra gets beat half to death with no stoppage and still comes out on tOP! imo IZZY would have done the same thing... wheres mazzaggatti at??
Bruh I know leg kicks is a bitch but that left hook had him on skates.  Like DC said it’s not a rivalry if u lost all three
You'll be back Izzy, you can lick this 👊👊👊
What the foook is heee weaaring?? - insert Conor voice 😂😅
Frozen, like Izzy. 😆 🤣
If you're scared of getting knocked  out you'll probably get knocked out, i could see he was disturbed by his loss to Periera especially the knock out.
I will not watch UFC again until Izzy is back
Izzy is still the champ f*** Alex poatan
Your still the character issy. Love u man
body shots and leg kicks...were killers...to this fight
Nobody's talking about it, but the wrestling tired Izzy out too during the fight. You could see he was flat footed and laboured with his movement in the 5th.
Unlike many others, still respectful about the defeat👏👏
Go paint your nails you ferry
I kind of liked Izzy but not too much but this fight I really like them because after a loss he stood up like a man and came to the interview and was honest I really really like this guy if anything I think this got a more fans and then the next time he fights Alex he's going to put it on my way
This was the same way Kamaru Usman lost to Edwards. Kudos to Pereira.
I knew the leg was affecting him; really all he had to do was coast in the 5th but his movement was limited it seemed
Imagine taking the L and then getting interviewed in that ridiculous coat!
he should have run everytime alex come😂😂😂😂😂thats what happens when he actually fight🤣🤣🤣
Frozen Elsa hahaha im Happy this Cartoon Shit ist over
where are r u yamasaki
Hats off to Alex Periera. Four fights in the UFC. Ate a shot after the bell in the first round, took down the champion,  and KO'd the ex champion.  Crazy. He Also fought Izzy in Kickboxing when Izzy had almost 80 pro fights more than Periera.  Weathered the storm.   Still arrogant in defeat. Looking like a ferry ash Chewbacca.
I felt like he knew he had it coming this whole week. His energy was different. He was winning the fight but pereira just has the power
What a champ, you handled your loss like your wins, respect brother
You got KO str8 the fuck out!!!
If it wasn't for the bell in the first round, Izzy would've most likely finished Alex, but unfortunately, shit happens and that's just the way it is in combat sports and in Life. Interesting to see how Izzy rebounds from this KO/TKO loss, and to see what the near future holds for Alex's reign as champion.
Izzy is such a cool cat. Gets TKO’d out and loses his belt and says he is grateful. And he means it. He is a true champion, fights anyone anytime and will always be great and a legend.
The fur coat says everything that wrong with a fighter who's become bored with his craft and is living the lifestyle. Happens to most.
Izzy was feeling the power of Alex tonight, he can't say he wasn't.
Too much fainting without striking. Faint strike,  faint strike,  faint faint strike, faint strike, faint faint faint strike, that's how it's done,  don't just faint for a whole minute without striking.
Bring back steve lol
I like Alex and I like story so I'm glad he won. But in the MMA rematch I have Izzy. We'll see tho. Something tells me he takes a little time and someone else with wrestling like Rob just wipes Alex out of the picture.
That was how ye handle a lost
He could have just danced around in the last round but he didnt and wanted to give everyone a great fight
Good
He's not being humble at all, that's not a true fighter. I hate to see him go on a losing streak.
Win like a champ lose like a champ. Champion is a state of mind after all.
Ranga coat suiwee
I disagree with Izzy when he says if the referee let's it go, he might loose the round but win the fight... I think he would've been knocked out cold.
Such an amazing fight! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time! Its was obvious Izzy was gonna get ko'd though. Dudes chin just doesn't sit well on the body when a guy his own size punches him.
Respect Izzy for always clearing out that monster shit bottle at his press conferences
That was an awesome fight, very proud of Izzy , let’s face it Alex P is a heavy weight 🤷🏻‍♂️
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
So happy he lost
World best fighter is alex not you. You are not greatest your career is over. You just have advantages of your height that's it.
That left hook of Alex's is deadly, Izzy fought well was up 3-1. Gotta feel for him but that's the game 🤷‍♂️
Izzy could have played safe and wrestled, used his mma experience
Izzy could’ve won by simple jabs and 1-2. And some kicks for points.
7th fight!!    its not over!
PEREIRA DIDNT LET HIM RUN, PUT THAT PRESSURE
He needed to be  humbled was lovely to watch
Looks like he’s off to a Star Wars convention after, going dressed as chewbacca.
I'm a big fan
I knew Alex would do it!  One more African to go Francis ngsno
That wasn’t a knock respect for you being humble Jewish media 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
He got FROZEN. LIKE ELSA ❄️
He will always haunt izzy
RIP, Israel Adesanya.
Ahh trust and believe peirera is gonna get expose soon. His ground game is fucking shit. Either khamzar moves up and kills him or rob is gonna exploit the fk out of his ground game
Honestly Alex should thanks Izzy, if Izzy wasn't here no Alex existing, he live with Izzy fame,
The man needed a beating. Be talking so much rubbish.
That "thanks David" tells alot about his personality
And hooker won
Belt gone humbled Alex periria 3-0
Dude was one punch away from not being lucid. Needs to learn to stay off the cage. This is good for the division. It was getting boring.
Nah I want to see Alex vs Rob. If Rob wins then it's a full circle with Rob and Israel.
Big fan of Israel, but 4th fight is a fucking joke. Pereira is just built different! Even stats are in Pereiras favor. Seeing them grapple was funny, purp belts in my gym can take those two out in no time 😂! Insane striking tho by the two, Pereira is just different beast, feels disappointing when you got beaten up in your new home where ur fans favorite.
Alex vs Adesanya 3-0
Did izzy just kinda infer that he has some type of traumatic disease? I don't mean to sound like the tmz guy lol but that was highkey a crazy thing to say just for reporters to ignore.
this performance just showed izzy being scared/worried of pereira's ko power. still a great performance for both. the fact that pereira's corner told him to ko him and he went and just did it is CRAZY
He’s just as graceful in defeat as he is when he wins.
Still a champ in my eyes if Alex were to fight Whittaker no doubt Whittaker would ground and pound him
He says he would have lost the round but still been champ. Alex is a killer and hits like a heavyweight. He should be picking out a Christmas card to send to the ref for saving his life as Izzy was getting worse and worse with every punch. If Alex would have landed 2-3 more of those, he wouldn't be able to do any interviews, he'd be on his way to the hospital and not able to get a rematch for a long ass time. I think it's better to have the stoppage and get the rematch sooner. Alex is the man considering it's only his 5th MMA fight. Whoever he fights next, I'd avoid a grappler.
Respect even though I don’t like him
Always will be great! Fantastic performance, just got unlucky there like Usman!
i didnt think anyone could beat izzy's striking but alex is on a different level.
Hhhhhh Izzy lose
My respect for izzy increased so much tonight
I’m so fucking happy this happened
Alex is world best fighter.
Stupid coat,is not even that cold in NY! Stop with excuses,he was not where he is because of you!
That match would’ve ended in the 1st round with a KO,
Yessss this MOTHERF… LOSSSSSS
Overrated for a long time. He plays with his food too much.
Izzy is a Class act…
Trying to wrestle a striker isn't "putting on the line". Come on Izzy, you're better than this. He tried the cheap tactic, but luckily it didn't work out. No one wants to see Izzy beat Pereira by wrestling. (which he probably does in the re-match, takedown and hug him for 5 rounds)
The last year started disliking Adesanya.. only to find myself now having more respect for him than ever. What a champ.
He did what he said...He made the champ actually fight and lean on his grappling a lot moreee! GREAT FIGHT
Hard to believe that Galvao gave Izzy a purple belt.
McDonald’s I’m loving it!
Izzy will always struggle with fighters his height. He cant defensive fight them as well as shorter fighters if they can reach him.
Yo izzy just said he’s in the same situation as chadwick boseman…. Does that concern anyone or am i trippin?
Always just had a general dislike for Izzy and tbh idfk why… he totally has my full respect now. The way he handled that fight, was winning, lost, and the presser afterwards? That’s class. Cocky/confidence. Same thing. But being classy, giving full props to Alex (but for real, the “medical behind the scenes?? don’t do that, that’s what real losers do, you’re not one) and the way Alex was able to beat him? Full respect.
And now come all the rats and fat bums to talk shit about Izzy because he lost.
Adesanya  you still  aquela  Máquina.
I think Rob should get title shot next, then Izzy
Lookin like Chewbacca
Stoppage was right, Isreal would of been sent to oblivion,  Alex was going to throw that knee
I heard his walk out theme song cost him the fight is that true
You fought well Izzy!!  Good to see you in high spirits. I’ll pray for you. No bitterness
Was Pereira's son in the audience????
I really never care about the winer or losser that was a great mach and I really  want to see one last remach from this  guys
i was saying during the firght STICK & MOVE!!!. dont stand in front of that guy and exchange!..... comeback champ🥃. Alex is a beast🫡
Heal well Izzy... Whatever you may be going thru... Kudos to all these warriors 🔥
Classy in defeat. Gotta respeck it.
Alex is a very intelligent Fighter he finished Izzy's Leg's first so that he didn't Evade him and Run far like he usually does hits and runs from his Opponents but Alex had better Plans Alex Froze him like Elsa.
Bwahahaha got foooked af 🤡
Superman ain't shit 🦇  your kryptonite
He took his lost like a G and kept the same energy..respect  to Izzy
Pereira is yo daddy izzy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Like a boss Izzy! Proud of u from Australia bro!!!
Izzy  You keep growing. If you work your cardio, and inprove power and the ending youre going to be the King for a long time.
What a nekraw
Who thinks the leg….?  Who thinks the head?   Who think Izzy being a sook?  I think Alex whooped his ass….  Izzy trying to save face and congrats to him for trying ….. but it ain’t working.  Give him props for answering questions, even if they were terrible questions.
Fame gets to mother fuckers head.
that boi lying 😂 😂. 😂 😂 😂 he gone cry in the car!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he even took down the monster water 😂 fuckk all this shit??????? fuck anybody else?????????????????????? u mad boi!!!!!! an now u sad boi!!!!!!!!!!!
Humbled
Common sense was beat into him.
Yeah, i am rooting for Alex to win by KO .. but, I like him in defeat than him in is wins.  Class act in general, but there are some excuses in there
Shitty stopage. So sad for Izzy Who controlled the full fight, Pereira only conected a takedown and 2 one two including the winning one. Undeserved
Wow now he tryin to act like it was a early stoppage 😒😂😂
He needed to lose and I’m happy he did. Same with usman.  Now these guys are free from the belt we might get some action 😅
The fur is tacky AF... and the first thing he's done that disgusts me.
Adesanya was winning effectively with the 1-2 left right combo up until the middle of the 4th round. When he suddenly switched & tried to grapple with the bigger fighter he exerted himself & got overpowered in the 5th round.
I would win with you in that ferret coat. Stinky.
3-0 pereira 😂😢😂😢
I feel it was definitely an early stoppage.
Still loving izzy, hes a beast! Love u man! You had beat beast ppl!
Israel has a chin cos anybody else wouldve been slept.
Unlucky brother you were winning every single  round in my opinion, he got lucky. keep your head up you will win the rematch.
😂
Izzy your great love always You still a CHAMPION🤴🏾🇳🇬
Get that Chihuahua outta here😂
Respect wow✔🇨🇦🥊
If fight hadnot been stopped he would have join the ghost club. The main defect in Izzy's game is that even being in MMA for these years he did not learn how to wrestle. The only way to stop Alex is on the ground on feet may be only Ngannou can finish Alex, man with Iron chin and stone hand
Handled it very well fair play to Izzy i think he can beat alex but he needs to sit down on his shots more and he can ko him he hurt him a few times.
It is time to go back to your fuck$ favela in Nigeria then hahaha cry little boy, cry louder...
Much needed humbling. Well deserved.
ALEX FOUND HIS CHIN LIKE NEMO!! NO MORE ARROGANT SoDeMiTe PIECE OF SH_T, FOR NOW ANYWAY!! GURU WAS RIGHT AND I AM HAPPY FOR ALEX!!
Perreira is too much for him!
Periera just has his number
sometimes we are above, sometimes we are below I love the energy from Izzy, he still smiles even though it hurts to accept the statement It doesn't matter, one day he will be stronger🏆
I think it was pretty much early stoppage. Israel is the CHAMP, Atleast let him get knocked out or submitted. He ain't the Champ for nothing. But BIg ups to Alex for winning. Hope to see more fights from him :D The man is a beast!
and NEW!!!
perineal nerve!!!!!lol wtf did he just say......smart dumb ass!!!
All you guys are not really fans, obviously something is medically wrong with him and if you watched Israel through the years he has never 😉 wink so much, I'm guessing something is wrong with his one eye, plus the chest thing makes me wonder if he has a serious medical condition that can be treated. The fact that his God's son and he is a healthy strong athletic will help... love you izzy💜
He wasn't there he was done for bro he's capping
You mean your chin .....not your leg
This was like usman vs leon fight..usman dominated till he got undone by pure power hit😊
Also he looks very different..  Like drained.  As someone mentioned,  he should go train with Khabib yea..   Nd let the mental/ emotional baggage go while at it
We love you Izzy! You were winning this fight and unfortunately got caught. You'll be back stronger, no doubt.
Not an early stoppage lol take the nail paint off and stop complaining
6:07 there was when he lost the fight... the ghost and the feeling of the defeat came.back to his head.
His opponent didn’t scared or respect his power. That’s the key to win in every fight. Always put 100% to kill your opponent if you have while thinking your punch or kick. A
What I don’t like is he wearing that animal coat.
Im glad izzy is okay
You don’t deserve immediate rematch sorry…. 3-0….
he Nate Diaz’d him in the first
what aclassy post match after defeat feedback..champ champ
Bring back Steve Mazagati😂
Izzy could've made the fight boring but he embraced the close quarters and fired his shots. Nothing to be ashamed of here. Alex is just built to be the anti-Izzy
When you buy a coat for an occasion and don't end up needing it..
"Fuck I sound like Rob right there" lol!
Respect
Now he can go and transition
Beautiful brother!  Still the champ you fought and won every round bring on the rematch!  #humble#thelastylebender#learn#notloss
I wonder what’s going on behind the scenes with Izzy? He keeps mentioning that.
He lost against the Polish guy aswell, nice legacy 😅
Good guy good fight.
He wearing a skinned orangutan?
Damn, ..why can't Connor be this chill about losses....I don't agree with other stuff that Izzy spouts (that jordan peterson crap is a no no for me)  but his integrity as a fighter is unquestionable..he truly is just this chill martial artist that takes things in stride win or lose...
Damn, not a single excuse, all respect
Incredible Champion, it’s safe to say Izzy is the smaller fighter but damn he pieced him up, if only he could have stayed away from him in the last round Izzy will still be the champion but soon he will get him in the rematch
This was literally his best performance to date BECAUSE it was the highest level striker possibly to fight right now and he fought so dang well and it was an amazingly dangerous fight. I love his fearless behavior
He is the running champion of UFC see the fight how he is running
The cringe fest finally comes to an end!
We are living in a simulation. If you saw what happened to Usman and  Izzy  It was unreal.  2 out of 3 African champs are lost. If this momentum continues I think usman and Izzy will take their belts back.
tuff
Israel hates *monster energy drink*  More than Alex pererira
Miss Pereira
I hope Izzy will now realize that he has to bring back the old aggressive Izzy. The one who knocks people out viciously. But I'm not sure if that's even possible in this current state of his career and money. Most great fighters are always at their best when they are still climbing the ladder.
Respect to Izzy
Like how he asked for water and puts away the energy drink.
3 X 0 kk  🇧🇷🏆
The only thing is the brazilian guy has powerful left hand, if not he'll froze like an elsa
Izzy you're the man. Stay sharp boss man!
The bully got bullied.😢
Dare to be great? You lost twice with that mind set. Dare to actually fight and not run more like, double loss douche bag
Izzy I think you thought Alex is just like gift haha but he is really gift but not expected
Aaaah he kicked my ass 2 now it's 3 times aaah he had a lot more power than my and brings me back to the earth I'm so humbled now  This is what he should say  Hey I love how UFC makes you to believe you are the king and then someone comes and cut your head off 🤣
So happy for Alex, love his fighting style
Trash champion,  glad he got finished. Maybe he will actually fight again to get his belt back..
Excuses, Lmao
Told ya Izzy will Freeze like Elsa and Alex did it put Izzy on Skates, I wish I had a Million bucks I would have Won Miliions today
I think if the referee had continued the match we would have seen a big knockout
Legend regardless 👑
That is some humble pie he got served😂
Frozen like Elsa hahahaha 😂
He was done for the ref saved him from being seriously hurt
Early stoppage
Good shit can't stand the guy
Take that l
Dude is losing
Did he compere his titts hanging to dude dying from cancer? And he would get koed inside 5sec from stopage.
Adesanya spectacular fight. True champion and shit happens like he says. He'll win next one. Now Pereira gotta defend it..
I don’t like him one bit and was happy Alex got the job done but he has taken the loss like a true professional.  Got to respect him.
Everyone has a bogey man by “ Tyson fury “
Should have not stopped it would have loved to see assasonya   laying on the canvas.He wasn't fine.Got his as s beat
U got fd up
🔨3️⃣🤫🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He got no knockout power
Izzy is a true champion, and he will be back. Still a warrior! It takes a lot to go out there. Nothing but respect & love ❤️
I'll always love you Izzy, the best striker in MMA I've ever seen. Shit happens, you're the best
You have so much talent,  and you can be the one. However u have no manners. You have no respect and the wrong people around you. Wake up, .. Your money cannot buy style. Be humble.. Peace
This man is in a while different category! Legend!
Anyone seeing something from planet.
I think he won the first three rounds. Granted his opponent won the last round but thats the only upper hand be had.
The dickeating is insane in this comment section. Here’s the facts: 1. There was no early stoppage. Izzy was going to hit the canvas if the fight continued 10 more seconds. 2. Izzy is a boring fighter & a rematch makes no sense. It would be the same outcome. 3. Alex is the better fighter.   End of discussion. Goodnight everyone! :)
Dude dominated him then gets a arguably early stoppage..  Similar to the previous fights.  The first was a clear robbery the second was dominantion then k.o  Lol they haters are ouchea like they getting paid saying the most random and dumb stuff smh..
3 wins and 2 k.o. now drop the pearls and give up the sexy nails,
I’m glad to see he’s in good spirits about this, so gracious in defeat, real classy guy! But I’d be lying if I said this didn’t reeeeeaally suck😞
Honestly Izzy and Alex might as well combine camps and train with each other no need to keep fighting your big brother n losing
Wrong stoppage from ref
It's a done mission bro, Pereira is the daddy!! You still the champ even if u didn't fight like it Tonight man
not the outcome he was looking for, but the man stays humble in defeat and victory whilst continuing to learn!  Head up Izzy, Get ya health right and on to the next one, Champ!! 🤴🏽🇳🇬🇳🇿🎯
He's finally getting gyno surgery I think. Good for him, should have done earlier before people gave him a nick name
Your a beast man !!!
Great humility. Mental mastery . He’s a good man izzy
Lol so FULL of shit, he got KTFO
Much respect my African brother..go get into next time.
I honestly feel bad for the guy. He just got stopped and probably really just wants to ball up and cry after such a devastating defeat. Instead he has to put a fake smile on his face and is obligated to answer these questions. Which is the last thing he wants to be doing.
You have nothing to Alex Perrera
Pre mature stoppage in my opinion
Crazy what izzy has done to all these mad fighters and Alex comes in 5th fight fucks up izzy 3-0.
Imagine Ali saying I lost because someone hit a nerve hahaha mmgay
Alex Pereira is just better. His achievements in kickboxing already showed it. I mean like, I know this is MMA but it's not like these two suddenly became wrestlers. This was 90percent a kickboxing fight, and Pereira was always the better kickboxer.
Pereira knocked Izzy into bigfoot
Izzy is an all Time great
I don't know man ,I feel like that stoppage was bs but whatever dude.
After seeing him where that unnecessary coat that cost a life of a innocent animal to make that's what makes me feel happy to see him lose, f*** anybody that wears fur for fashion
IF IZZY TRAINS WITH KABIB HE WILL WIN THE REMATCH!!
I had Ryan Spann by KO, Weili By Sub, Poirier By Sub, And Izzy Decision, £1 for 940 Back got let down in the last round so devastating but that's just MMA. Such a cruel sport but my adrenaline watching the fights tonight was through the roof. What a night!!!!!
He outclassed Alex in every aspect of that figtht. When he hurt his leg, he could not be as mobile, it was game over.
Doesn't even look like he was in a fight.
How can someone who loss still like a champion and strong ass fuck
This game is not fair, izzy had him all arounds and they stopped the fight to soon. So sad
Israel look like an orang utan
He should have swallowed his pride and coasted a victory by wall hugging alex in the 4th and 5th round to an easy victory. If you want your get back with alex standing, go into kick boxing and take him out there standing, dont do it in mma. Especially in 4 oz gloves
Took the loss like a real champion
Now he'll get fans... After he loses the belt. Ain't this a crazy game!?!?
Respect to Izzy! I wanted Alex to win hands down. Went for his 3rd defence is 10 months. No other champion is that active
Lose or win much respect to Izzy for taking a big challenge and putting on an amazing show! UNLIKE THST CHICKEN ROADRUNNER SPENCE
Kamaru and Izzy will be champ again in 2023
Great 👌
Pre op
Izzy fought well, problem is that Alex is a heavyweight contender cosplaying as a middleweight
Early stoppage
Early stoppage i knew it!
I’m just gonna say, mad respect for Izzy but wtf is you wearing bro 😂
Fucking style bender chia pet.
This was probably the best outcome for mma fans. Sets up a rematch and if Izzy can find a way to get past his kryptonite a trilogy could definitely be in the cards. Sucks for the rest of the mw tho💀
Honestly this was probably the best outcome. Izzy may have lost but he’s still in good spirits and healthy, so there’s a lot of hype for the rematch and it will bring in crazy PPV numbers. The middleweight division needed some excitement.
Huge respect!
Humbled to the max. The arrogance level is down to zero. Congrats to Pereira btw! 👌
this fight was fantastic
Much respect! People hate to see a person with a truthful heart!
True champ. Unlucky I feel for him
What kind of coat is that?
Izzzy didn’t look hydrated comeing into this he looked sucked in something went wrong 😑
There’s levels to this game mate
I think Izzy should google perineal never and where it’s located lmao
Everyone is missing the fact that he hinted that he's fighting a medical condition, MAYBE even some type of cancer, Izzy likes to drop hints real subtle, people need to pick up the pace
Dingbat reporters... repetitive and dumb questions.
Kudos to Izzy for no excuses and showing up to answer questions.
The mysterious big foot in the flesh 😂
Izzy gassed pereira out in the 3rd with the ground control. Pereira was completely gassed in the 4th where Izzy should have put pressure and gone for the KO. He played it too safe and wanted to win by decision, ended up giving pereira time to recover.. I was rooting for pereira but it was sad to see Izzy getting rocked ❤
I’d definitely pay to see 3!!
Sparked home boyyyyyy
2 down 1 more to go, it was in Jones hand
Its not that unfortunate he cant handle the power of pereira
For alex , rematch is good for him  because I don't think he win against bobby nuckel
He definitely wasn’t fine, he just woke up a few times. I love Izzy but he seemed complacent and I had Alex getting the finish. He’ll come out better from this
Izzy put up a new persona to deal with this press conference
Read between the lines hopefully Izzy isn’t facing any disease get well soon champ.
Izzy fans left frozen 🥶 like Elsa 😂
Did this man just say he has cancer
Izzy a little groggy from that beat down and certainly hintng at excuses 🙄
It got stopped too soon he was still on his feet wtf lol
Alex is 3-0 against Izzy. I think Strickland vs Izzy should be the next fight and who ever when’s that fights Alex.
Unfair when you have KO power you only need too be lucky once.
Can someone answer my question? Was this a fight scheduled just because of first lost against his opponent got overly hyped after a period of time or did his opponent earn his title shot
Weight difference on fight night was too big, man. We need to see big Rob Whittaker vs pereira. It might be a good match up. Whittaker walks around at 220 pounds.
Izzy should have worked kicks earlier
Alex will never get a fancy coat like this
Lol dude definitely didn’t keep the same energy
Wheres your flashing arrogance now? 🤣
U are great 👍
I bet if izzy was watching that fight he'd unenthusiastically say wooah while waking up from his sleep in the 5th under his blanket on the couch.
lol first time he risked it and this happened. i am happy boring , connor copying guys like him and usman lost
This fight is almost similar to Usman vs Edwards. Edwards losing on all scorecards. It's never over until the fat lady sings 🤑
I respect him more now.  He put it on the line when he was clearly winning.
i respect him for continuing to fight and defend his title, he’s right a belt doesn’t mean as much
Izzy gonna go back on sum never back down stuff and become champ again
Man alex managed to get him to the fence almost every round and there izzy was in most danger
Respect for this guy. He is still a very great fighter. He will be back
I respect this guy s lot. No much talk of hatred
In this game you one second of been knocked out , no matter how good you are , IZzy you did good mate 👊🏻You will be back
What a dark moment for Izzy.  He’s a true champion, and he will be back.  Nothing but love ❤
He was wobbling, heads down not defending at all, Alex could have kneed him. It was definitely TKO!! I'm glad ref stopped the fight before it got worse.
He lost cuz of how he dresses 🤮😂👎🏼🤲🤲👎
What happened to frozen like Elsa?? Go paint your nails and watch a cartoon lad, you'll be fine
I really wanted him to get his revenge 😢
Tried to point his way to a decision again and look what happened got kod in the 5th that’s what he gets for trying to extend the fight maybe if you went out and finished people like you said you would you’d still be champ 😂
He threw, he’ll never be the same !!! 😂
The man with the best chin won this fight...💯
Kamaru lost. Izzy lost. Next is Ngannou and somewhere jon Jones is a very happy man.
Usman and Izzy will get those titles back. Let’s go!!
what a great fight! thanks Alex 😂
This dude is class. I really wanted him to win this one. Comeback soon Izzy!
Seems no one in the media (narrative) wants to give credit to Alex Pereira.
Was such a treat watching that fight. Truly some insanely high-level striking.
Still a fan! Maybe he should train for power since people with power just need one shot.  Also he got his twice while dodging before it was stopped.
Take them fkn pearls off... THATS WHY YOU LOST!!!
Fuuu to the Maori reporter flexing te reo on the broad stage of mortal combat
He left me like a sleeping beauty
If he had an 8 standing count he could have survived
Dana had no choice but bring Alex to UFC.. Izzy was cleaning out division
Izzy still the best hands down ,real story is he fought a heavy weight tonight.
Have a look at the way this clown is dressed 🤦🏻‍♂️ I'm so glad he's no longer a UFC champion...total embarrassment to the sport.
He could see everything? Dude head wasn’t hanging down he couldn’t see shit 🤣
What a load ran the hole fight like a scared cat
Deserves to lose just for wearing that coat
Frozen like Elsa 🥶
Frozen lile Elsa 😅🤣
Very good lOl😃😄😃😄😁😅🤣🤣🤣😂
It’s funny he brought up Steve and I was right next to Steve the whole night in vegas while the fights was going on. Was talking about how the ufc needed him back.
Chocolate guy will loss again then retire or move down 😢
He can atleast shutdown hater for being boring. The fight is high class striking
Heads up izzy. F the haters.
Bring back Mazzagati
"WHO DARES WINS" Izzy in a nutshell..
Made up he lost
He’s trying so hard to act like he doesn’t care. 3-0 🥰
Run it back
A knee was coming if the fight didn't stop at that point...
Izzy needs this to fucking wake up and stop being a point-champ. Now he might do champ shit. He's a great fighter, he might come back. Pereira is a terminator, but was saved by good timing at the end of the 2nd.
As I said in the days before, height plays a very big role. In the previous ones, Adesanya was always taller. Now one was taller than him and he lost.
I had it 2-2 going into the last round
Izzy is a true champ...Alex was just too resilient,bigger and stronger
Love you Izzy
No is much better champion than this adesanya
The man is obviously hurt. How about letting him rest and recover. This has to be painful. Look at his eyes and mild slur in speech.
VIVA  Brasil  the rulers of the land; E nois  Alex Pereira!  This is it
"fuck i sounded like rob right there, yak" haha, pretending to be humble when you get shut down and bitched by your superior again and you manage to slip in glimpses of your true color taking jabs at people you can beat, that's why alex is izzy's dad LMAO
Dudes trash
Cant keep point winning forever
I would of wanted to see a little more before I stopped it he wasn’t out
Everyone prays for your downfalls, called you boring, rooted for you to fail, but everytime you failed, you got up to try again. You are a True inspiration and a great human being. Get your belt back. God Bless you brother🙏🏽
My boy izzy was easy in fifth round
Robert Whitaker is jumping for joy if Adesanya doesn’t get an immediate rematch bc Rob will be smart, get in tight, and take him down..   Of course Alex can catch anyone but he’s not outpointing and or beating any of these guys without catching them and knocking them out, and that’s Whitaker, even Brunson, Vettori, and a guy like Cannonier. Although not in contention for a title shot, in Gastelum..  Again he can shut EVERYONE’S LIGHTS OUT and FAST! But these are guys capable of not just taking him down and controlling him but finishing him on the ground, bc Izzy was able to control him. Izzy who has good takedown defense, but you see still not close to being elite on the ground although working on that part so hard for yrs now. You just don’t add that to the level of guys who’ve been wrestling or grappling thru bjj for many many yrs. He looked very lost on the mat, so I can only imagine if that was 1 of the above aforementioned names, things would have went much worse.   But he is so exciting to watch and you have to think 205lbs will eventually be in his future.., he’s FK HUGE lol
Drake curse
still full of shit, awful personality great fighter
So so so early. Dude was literally weaving 😂 the most defensive boxing movement he could be doing at the time, which means he was 100% conscious and in that fight.ark should be fired
Man some people just have your number. I think if Izzy capitalized on Alex’s fatigue in  the 3rd Rnd And just applied relentless  pressure he would’ve won. He shook him at the end of the first but it is what it is.
The patience and the recovery of Alex is incredible
What's up with that jacket? That is a  ridiculously damned ugly jacket! It seems to fit his personality at this moment.
Also - fucking hell, Marvin goddamn Vettori actually has a chance at becoming champ now..
So much for all that "mana" that "couldnt be f****d wit" 😂🤣
I say let Khamzat face Alex and set up another Whitaker vs Adesanya fight just for a super card kind of thing where the winner of one faces off against the winner of the other.  Izzy can't lay on the cage and rest he has to angle off against top tier strikers.  The 2nd thing is if you're stunned don't clinch the head but wrap up the body.
I'm not a fan of Izzy but that was a great interview and he is showing true class in defeat.  Impressive...
Bring back Steve mazagadi
If ref let fight continue, myb adesanya get himulate very bad. So pls thank to reff ya
Usmand bye...adesanya bye whos next
I prayed for you so much man! You are champ no matter what!!!! Even Ali had losses. Keep your head up!
It was more entertaining than his Yoel Romero fight, even if he did lose.
I am too invested after he lost i just sat in my car in silence for a while 🤣 you will be back izzy
"...bring back Steve Mazzagatti" 😆
Classy in defeat, shows character of a true champion every time
Rematch
Fuck that fur coat.
But what did Chris Pratt have to say about this
Good talk u will get back am waiting now for u and usman as champ again
History repeats itself for Izzy Adesanya, great fighter but Alex has his number in competition matches
I straight up feel for adesanya it's like his whole career the UFC has been doing everything to tarnish his career or make it seem illegitimate .... Also... I hope he's not fighting cancer that would truly be devastating to find out
He's doped for years even got a boob but that's not enough against  Pereiras thicker bone structure and superior power
An animal was killed for him to wear that 😂
Modol🤣
Gracious in defeat. What a bloke 👏🏻
Schaub continues with that unbeaten prediction career
JUST WORK ON YOUR GRAPPLING IZZY, N YOU WILL GET HIM NEXT TIME .. BUT CONGRATS TO ALEX TOO
Izzy is such a true champ after this lost, very classy, none of that could of, would of BS,  he took it like a man. Today I truly love this guy.
Respect
Class act champ.
Well now your humble!!
Thats what make Adesanya a great champion... to speak nice and calm!👍😁❤️
So the 4th fight will be "nothing to lose" fight for him?, yeah "nothing to lose" condition is the stronger form of any fighter.
Run Izzy, hug Izzy, sleep Izzy
Israel was going to win on a UD, pretty similar to the Glover/Jiri fight but Glover was Alex's teammate this night. The fight proved how dangerous Adesanya is and why every other opponent never engaged.
This is what happens when izzy doesn't have his usual size advantage
First thing he said he’s grateful damn what a mindset man
Will never be champion again.  Bo Nickle coming and khamzat are gonna be destroying that weight devision
he keeps the same energy and runs out the ring after the winner was announced 🤡🤡🤡
Man Izzy :/ aye g this is your rock lee moment when they told him he couldn’t walk no more! And he took the risk
You have lost against  Alex 3 times that's facts 💯
💪💪💪💪🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🌟
This is mixed martial arts right? So shut the hell up with your excuses
One of those types of guys that is always a winner, even taking a loss.  Cool dude
Man I'll be happy for the next 2 weeks just thinking about this moment in history lol, happy destroy adesanya day everyone haha
He is just arrogant crap and he got kicked by Alex but still does not want to acknowledge. Superb KO winAlex
We love ya Izzy
If only he didn’t stumble and do that back roll..
Let’s make it 4.0 soon 🔜 😂😂😂
I was still lucid... for another 5 milliseconds before getting starched. Great fight though. I loved his strategy of blocking all those punches with his face.  Very smart.
That coat is from wokonda a rare bear from the That land….. looking forward to learning more about this land and fighter
Izzys striking and mma skills out classed Alex for majority of this fight but the power of Alex connected when ever he had izzy against the cage, I can't wait for the rematch
All I hope is that Izzy gets his belt back  I know he will, but I also knew he was going to win this fight
That Steve Mazigati line hahaha
Even though Izzy won the majority of the fight, overall Alex has his number. Kind of like how Anderson had Chaels number. Even though Chael whipped Anderson for over 30 minutes in total, Silva only needed 30 seconds. Similar situation here.
Good sportsmanship
I think it’s done his in izzy’s head I don’t think izzy will win again
I’m glad he lost for wearing that hideous coat
This drakes fault…
Still rooting for you bro!
Who is he trying to be now..chewbacca ??😅😅
If you don’t respect adesanya after this then idk what will
Takes khabib as your coach champ, and you'll be champ again...
What coat is it
Why is everybody saying he is arrogant?
Kept backin up too much, he should of pressed in round 4 when periara was gassed. He almost knocked him out in the first round too
Robert Whittaker up next
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
Good spirits make me happy today. Wish u guys quick recovery <3 much love from bosnia
😂😂 When he wins its a 20 minute presser when he takes the fat L it's 'I got some shit to do' and he started by saying I keep the same energy 😂😂😂 boy is shook you can tell and he won't get any sleep tonight, he left you frozen like Elsa 😂😂😂
Why he dress like whore brotha😂
Still love ya izzy Alex is a beast 😭
is wHITTAKER THE HARDER FIGHT FOR HIM
That’s  one homo erotic jacket 😬
Elsa fans stand up. Your boy got smashed. Tkoed damn his fans still say he was out classing and our grappling this and that. It amounts to nothing. Especially, when got beaten thrice now. Sometimes your opponent is the better fighter and he has your number. Denying it won't do anyone any favours.
Will always be a fan of izzy win or lose that man the champ
for those haters just stfu already the guy lost yall can have a good year now i feel bad for yall for the last 3 years when he was the Champ
Ayam sayur
Israel the man had you by 25 lb, don't feel bad
Lost in the same way, clearly ahead on scorecards, almost finished him early and Poatan found a way in the end. Rematch let's go
Where is you're fucking talk now  He deserved it 100%
Such poor comments from these journalists
Izzy was clearly not fine, he would've got slept properly if the stoppage didn't happen there and then.
The guy is very respectful. Amazing fighter!
The Nigerians are falling one by one.....😂
Really Feel for him no clue what he does next presuming Whittaker vs Costa gets the next shot
He doesn’t deserve a rematch. He has lost to this man 3 times. 3-0. Period plain and simple. Kudos to Alex for shutting Izzy up. FINALLY
Lmao not happy with stoppage? He was done. Rematch?  Get in line
And this guy wants to fight Jon Jones lol
Get your tongue out his ass. He's was the most boring champion the UFC has ever seen and just like Leon Edwards showed it doesn't matter about the other 24 minutes when you get that TKO.
Whatever u SHITTALKING ZIZZY UR DIZZY AND WASHED UP JOHNNY BONES WOULD DESTROY U NO QUESTIONS POINT BLANK PERIOD NO PROBLEM HELL THE WOLF WOULD KAMZAH WILL DESTROY UR ASS HE WILL HUNTBU DOWN AND SMASHHHHHHH UR FACE LETS GO CHICKEN LEAVING WITH DEFEAT AND NO BELT HAHAHHAHAH
Those who are yapping that Alex was outclassed in his last 3 fights with Izzy when the dude KOed him twice are either Izzy fanboys or need to retire from being keyboard analysts. If Alex is so outclassed then the joke is on Izzy for not finishing a guy who’s so outclassed but instead twice he gets “finished” was the fight close? Yes! Was Izzy winning on paper/decision yes! Does that matter in the end when you get KOed twice & still not give Alex credit? Hell no! The rest becomes childish excuses. If he did it once you might yap ur mouth but 3 times… I thought this was going to be different this is MMA that was 5 years ago in kickboxing, I thought it was revenge time… now more excuses that fight got stopped early? Sure go rewatch he didn’t even know where the punches were coming from & just bc u can still see doesn’t mean u are in the fight… all Alex needed to do if the ref didn’t stopped the “unprotected” punches was knees him hard to his head & then people would had screamed that fight should had been stopped to protect the fighters! These people & their excuses & not admitting defeat or trying to find excuses just so they can discredit Alex which no other UFC fighters have been able to do to Izzy twice over! Show some respect to the man who now has 2 KO’s against Izzy.
That's one orangatun coat
Pereira looks bigger than light heavyweights.
We love you izzy❤
Alex 3 - Izzy 0
Izzy definitely outclassed him in this fight. I got Izzy in the rematch.
Tried saying he has breast cancer is what I heard.
Dare to be great.. sure, but honestly on a competitive standpoint, you should have made a dude like him go through a few of the top 5 first, does he make it through Vettori ? Costa ? Could have thrown the dude to the dogs, more then likely lost and avoided this fight all together
Izzy will come stronger and stronger. What a nice guy!
Wish ref would have let him get ko to the ground.this 🤡 said his eyes rolled back but he was good😂 that’s what u get for being cocky🤡go sleep
I felt bad for izzy,the bell saved poatan in the 1st round but I don't anyone beating Alex in the division,even Whittaker won't last five rounds,not because Alex won but it's true.
No excuses buuuut let me give an excuse
He did it again, again, and again hahaha 😆 😂 🤣
Next 4 - 0
Class act. True warrior
Haha you didn't lose coz of your leg bro you lost coz you got cracked in the face lol cmon bro who you fooling.
Izzy is too eloquent to be just a MMA fighter.
If Usman deserves a rematch, Izzy does as well... Both 5th round finishes in fights they were winning.... And i really dont like him
I put money on Pereira winning by KO but this was crazy. Adesanya was winning on points by a wide margin, but every time Pereira connected he rocked him. But also it looked like Adesanya could knock Pereira out at any moment. Ultimately the size difference was too much and he was able to steal the fight last minute with a solid finish. Please I dont want to hear about early stoppage. If the ref wasnt there to stop the fight it would have been ugly, Pereira was landing clean and the ref gave Adesanya a chance to fight back, which he didnt. Now I think it's fair to have an immediate rematch.
Come back stronger
Wearing that ridiculous coat after getting knocked out by a guy who already beat you twice. Clown.
It's crazy how much copium is being smoked and passed on here... It was a hell of a fight, just enjoy it.
His Nigerian luck ran out. 1st Usman got knocked out then Izzy Next Jon Jones will defeat Ngannou 💯👊
Not how you start but how you finish
Brazilian Kryptonite….
Bullshit. Early Stoppage. Man was still bobbing and weaving, got caught with 4 shots out of all that exchange. Izzy is definitely the better fighter in my opinion.  Alex was definitely the toughest fight. Biggest thing he did was to stop Izzy from taking the center and pushed forward in the earlier rounds. Great fight. But early stoppage
1 thing I like about izzy is that win or lose he keeps the same energy
Took so much steroids he grew breasts, still not good enough to win against Alex! FUCK YOU GYNOSANYA!
Alex is a beast, I reckon izzy will get the belt back
Alex is a G to the end.
“Dare to be great, and I am”
He is still awesome!
😂😂😂 dangerous on the ground 😂😂😂 this guy still too cocky.
These replies to the top comments seem to be from Izzy haters. People seem more glad that Izzy lost than that Alex won. I thought Izzy was better skillwise, but that physical difference was too great. Alex's power, size and build just were too different. izzy was probably 195 to 200 while Alex was around 220 after rehydration.
Respect he put up a great fight
Izzy has real champ mentality. Excited to see him back in the octagon when he’s ready
I'm soooo pissed that he lost to this guy, I don't feel like he should be able to take his belt,  given all the wins he had in the UFC
Shuuut up ! You win now 3 fuckin Time !
Fkn wild night of fights. Best sport in the world. As an Izzy fan, damn jus 5 more seconds in the first…  Whatever  Stoppage was good. Izzy was about to be face down. Congratulations to Alex and Old Man Glover.
Get he's weak ass outta here . Was finally forced to fight but got rocked haha
Proud of him, always a fan. Alex put up a great fight as well. Warriors both of 'em!
You didnt put anything on the line! Alex was the next fight, he is your boogyman... made you retire from Kickboxing and then follows you to the UFC. He is the Style Ender..   Your days of snoozefests are over Izzy. The most boring fighter in the division, the jab and run point wins will be the highlight of your career. That will be forgotten in a year! Bye bye punk!
Israel is overrated and a boring fighter. Played safe but when shit hit the fan, he couldn’t handle it
It shouldn't be up to the refs to protect the fighters, they are adults and know very well what they're getting into. Fans want to see finishes, definitively, this is what fighting is, violence, raw and bloody and the refs are ruining it.  If anything it should be up to the fighters corner to throw in the towel.
I don't want to be a hater and a nit picker but goddamnnnn Alex looked bigger than a light heavy weight in there tonight
Maybe I'm over-analyzing, but I sure hope that Chadwick Boseman analogy isn't too accurate.
Feels like Izzy should've put his hands together more. Whenever he'd come after the jab with a 2, it'd always land and drive Alex backwards. He didn't want to become too predictable, but that legit almost put him away multiple times. I hope he gets that hungry, angry mentality back. Also comes in lighter and with a higher volume. Seems like every time he bulks up, he gets slower, gasses more and loses. Much love though.
Still a Champ...
Alex killed the animal Izzy is wearing
Nice coat
You'll keep living the same until you learn the lesson. It's all about Izzy. Fight Pereira but most of all fight your demons.
We all just gonna ignore the gyno again?....
Why izzy seems to have a female face? (today)
izzy was doing great until he got caught after that kick, messed up his whole momentum
EARLY STOPPAGE.  I WANTED MORE PUNISHMENT 🤣
I like humbled Adesanya the same way I liked humbled Usman, it was super necessary...
Class f*ckin' act... ✌😄
Those last moment after izzy tripped he should have just go for the clinch.
I do wanna preface that it wasn’t an early stoppage. He went down and got back up and was just getting battered with shots. Yeah he was moving his head but the shots were still landing. He was hunched forward as well. Falls down, then goes on to hunch over, keeps taking blows to the head. I mean when is it enough? He would’ve been knocked out brutally
He's just not on Alex level..plain and simple..to lost 3 times that just tells u
Best outcome possible. We got ourselves a new champ, and the old one still looks as strong as before. No humiliation, no hate, they both showed respect to each other.
ABSOLUTE FVCKING LEGEND.....He cleared the entire division....Let Alex try that...🤷🏽‍♂️
All the Israel D riders in these comments about to OD on copium. He lost, no excuses lol. Alex is just better 3/3 times.
He was hurt , he just has too much pride to admit it. The ref stopped it right , it's a catch 22 because if stopped early or late the ref gets criticized.  Izzy wasn't defending himself.
Izzy wouldn't have even attacked if Alex didn't. I aint going to forget Izzy's reign of terror. We are now free and hopefully we will stay that way
Perira just has number like Rampage has Chuck Lidells.
I like humble Izzy more than flashy champion Izzy. He is a good fighter but his title run just didn't have gas left
Once Pereira opens up, Izzy is in trouble, and he knows it. Bigger, stronger, better. Again. 🏆
The fact that he knows the reporters names, and how respectful he is to them. That’s a good man
Anyone know the name of the watch he's wearing?
3 - 0
If Jiri beats glover again…. Izzy should have another crack at LHW
Isreal has that champions mindset. Love the way champions think.
Man has class. Will always have respect for this guy
GYNOWRESTLER
Gyno fraud got exposed
Did this dude really compare his gyno to Chadwick's cancer? Wtf, c'mon izzy no need for that, we know most people at the top of this sport use ped's but pulling the cancer card is a no go lmao
Izzy does not posses the skillset to beat Pereira. Pereira will win the fourth if it happens.. Izzy will live to fight again but as long as pereira is around he won’t be champion.. Question is where does Pereira go from here. In his sixth UFC fight he knocked out the champ that no one in the weight class could beat!!!
Pereira literally chasing Izzy all around the globe to KO him 😂
Great class 💯
He left the arena, killed a lion and made a coat!
hahahahha don't talk talk so many hahaha u loseee lol
Blah blah didn't work this time. Alex humbled him😁
I really wish the ref didn't stop it, I'd love to have seen if Izzy survived or Pereira would have knocked him out cold/beyond doubt
Izzy takes his wins like he takes his losses much respect to him
Izzy's prime is my favorite style to watch ever
My favorite fighter win lose or draw
I hope everything is good with Izzy. He was holding back talking about what's wrong with him & referencing Chadwick. Seemed really emotional about it.
Imagine how different fights would be if it was just 25mins in the cage.. 1 round to rule them all.
Man im just glad pereiras hooks screwed adesanyas head back on, so he doesnt talk about elsa from frozen
He looks fresh out the jungle book
Now you lost 3 times to him with 2 knockout loss. Admit that Alex is a better fighter in kickboxing and mma.
Proud of u izzy keep the fight going love.your strength and mind set
3 more minuted of that Vicious punches from Alex, he could've suffered brain damage. Thank the ref dipshit. He saved you.
All class bro
Dana take 🐺 boy of the chain and eat the pereira heart
Rematch about to go crazy
I'm a fan of Izzy but y'all Alex is very dangerouse
Now the finger nail paint seems a little fucked up.
Great run. The fact that there’s even a conversation of whether or not he deserves a rematch is mind blowing
It's  3  -  0  🇧🇷  👺
Even in defeat Izzy is calm, graceful and patience. He's really not salty. He has been a great champion
Ok I hope he's not saying he has cancer on the low
Not a fight I can clown Izzy for after his horrific decision performances. He put it on the line against a fighter who chased him down to MMA. Respect even if it 0-3
Why has he come out as a Rang Tang.
See doctor gurd,burping body is sick, check out hompathi doc,energy won't be good!
Anderson is still the 🐐
Chewbacca in the house
If the ref didnt step in then he would have been knocked clean out
Hopefully, We will see exciting title fights at Middleweight Division. Thanks Alex for  Ending of Snoozeblender Era  😴😴
Great fight. Got to see everything that is great about mma and the fight game in general
He handled the loss great
He may have lost tonight but he looked better tonight than his past few wins. Rocked Alex multiple times, showcased his grappling skills and exposed Alex’s. Marc had no biz stopping it that early, idgaf what no one says. Still my 🐐💯
This is the best performance better than Costa even he showed us alot of his B game. It may not be great but atleast he's working on it.
‘Dare to be great.’ Dare to win dude knocked u out again
I agree he was fine if not let him go out on his shield… but I thought he was good
Not a fan of him but he'll be back soon again, thats for sure. Hope he is more humble.
Still got mad love for you izzy
No more undefeated at 185 shit.
I am just happy he is in good spirit. What a champion 👏👏 Respect just respect
Izzy took a bunch of body shots in the clinch, I think that also played a role. But it's gotta suck for him as he was up 3-1, and that stinger left hook caught him again.
"I couldn't just leg kick at range with a shorter guy so I had to fight this time and got banged out" 😂
3th time
Not gonna lie….he needed this piece of humble pie. I’m sure he will be champ again but again, he needed this. Great action packed fight. Good job Izzy. Salute to the new champ Po Atan!
Bro could’ve got a feature in the ghost club if the ref didn’t save him
Izzy needs an entire zoo to hide the gyno
0:02 - I keep the same energy. Proceeds to take Monster Energy from the table. 🤣🤣🤣 Gotta love the humor
Hey it's an orangutan
YOU GOT FUKIN BEAT what a wanker saying if it went longer he’d of won on points this is why I’m glad he got shut down
Technical skill goes to Izzy for sure -- I'd even say they're levels apart but damn man, one hit is all it takes from someone like Pereira
All the izzy haters kicking a man when down, he put a good fight, got caught, dare to be great
Izzy didn’t get his French tip nails this time.
He hit him after the bell!
Should have started running during 5th roubx had the fight in your pocket. Got cocky and paid the price...
What a clown
Needs to grow up a bit. Just got humbled and then comes out wearing a massive fur jacket. Absolute gimp.
🙌🏼
alex was really conditioning izzys legs and body i saw on the live strike chart he had like 70+ strikes to the body and legs and when in the end he went up he got it done congrats alex and izzy had a great not boring performance
He wouldn't have won the 5th round if there was no stopage but Alex would have kept punching that head to pulp. Alex had cornerd izzy and there was no way out especially when izzy had all those heavy punches straight on the head.
The Fact that so called " HIGHEST IQ STRIKER" resorted to CLINCHING and GRAPPLING says about ALEX's striking pedigree.
Only fake fans and cowards talk crap about proven Champions after a lost. There is not or has ever been a Champion like Izzy.
You're still the champ to me!
He still looks fresh. What a dude
Alex looking extremely big to his weight class
Frozen like Elsa
Wtf is he wearing
Shout out Mazagotti!! 🫶
Humbled! at MSG. 3-0 ALEX
this week and especially this fight made me his fan much more. hope he takes it back soon
Early stoppage, izzy wasn’t even out cold like Frankie and Reyes
Wtf is he wearing 🤣🤣🤣🤦, 🤡🌎. Big foot is real..
Every time he’d get pinned along the fence I’d get nervous af, but he’d always evade. First time I felt confident he’d evade he gets clipped and loses😭
Just like the 2nd fight, Adesanya was winning till he wasn't
Early stoppage
Bro dressed as Cruella De Vil
I must admit Izzy did stand alot more than I thought he would. I thought he would be sprinting the whole time. Also anybody stepping in the ring with Alex has to have some respect, That man is scary AF  Sorry I take that back.. I did not realise he is wearing pearl necklace to compliment the fur...
The highest level of striking we’ve seen in an MMA fight. What a treat for the fans. I personally feel for a title fight it was an early stoppage but for a non title fight maybe not, either way what a fight. What a sport.
Rematch 4-0alex😂
I think Adesanya is DONE!
Lol
Why he wearing a chewbacca costume? 😂😂
I knew soon as seen that face off with Alex in war paint!! Izzy looked defeated and much smaller!!  Alex is huge for 185 I mean shit Izzy is huge for 185…. Alex just had his number!!
The difference between Jone "GOAT" Jones  and izzy is the killer mentality.
What about that fantastic jacket??  :)
Yay, no more I💤y “the decision bender” Gynosanya as champ. It should’ve happened with Whittaker but whatever this is better
Israel now has multiple losses within the past year lmao overrated
Israel adesanya 💪 You will shine again 👍👍👍I was so sad that you loss but relief after seeing your interview.
Israel “The Last Nurmagomedov” Adesanya... Never expected Izzy to wrestle & grapple that much 😂
Why is he wearing a costume 🤣👍 That REF saved him from a lot of damage.
Bruhhh Pereira put Izzy on skates like Elsa  😂🤣 🧊🧊🧊
I’m a fan of Izzy but he seems to be trying hard to seem unbothered. As a competitor he must be disappointed to lose to his greatest rival.
Pereira is too big for middleweight. I wanna see him fight jiri at lhw, that would be a fair match, even tho jiri would knock him out
Finally the black got humbled
I'm happy Alex won glad this guy lost
He took the defeat like a champ, nothing but respect to Izzy. The rematch is gonna be entertaining 🔥
3 -0 go home!
Chewbacca ate one hell of a flurry at the end there still great performance
Emotion is dead like that coat
İf there was 1 or 2 second alex will ko'ed man
Where was your spirits?  😂
Couldn’t run from this one. Height and Length finally wasn’t an advantage and this is the result.
JAN'S SON AND POATAN'S SON XD
Casuals thought Izzy was gonna win. 3-0 💀
This is what happens when you paint your nails, make Elsa one-liners, and dye your hair pink. Izzy needed to be humbled like Usman, AND NEW 3-0 POATAN!
Still putting nz on the map win or lose 🔥🔥
He's so much better technically and really should have won. Should've dove for the legs and hump his way to a decision. He was 3-1 up ffs
Amazing fight. It is clear who the better fighter is. But power sometimes prevails.
This dude Periera beat Izzy, rematched him, KOd him stiff, followed him to MMA & KOs him again. He truly must see him in his nightmares.
you are
Wakanda ain't forever lol
I think it’s time to accept Alex just has Izzy’s number. Beat him 3 times across 2 different sports. Great finish by Alex
When u lose but knw u can’t be a sore loser cuz that will make headline’s
Hate him or love him... Israel Adesanya has been the second longest reigning champ in middleweight which is no easy task. Nothing but respect to the former champ 👏🙌
He's salty as fuck because he didn't even shake his hand afterwards.
I feel sad about his chest comment and how he mentioned Chadwick. It’s so true. I hope he isn’t battling any medical issues because that would be just sad. You’ll be back styles
Them leg kicks from Alex was the game changer 10/10 fight iq
Rocked him at the end of the 1st, controlled most of the fight. Izzy will be back
Izzy dizzy 😵
Happy for Alex but now he's gotten to have belt I want adesanya to get it back. Even though his fights as champ have been mostly mid him beating the calibre of fighters he has puts him amongst goats.
Was such a treat watching that fight. Truly some insanely high-level striking.
Love this dude in win or lose
dare to be great, while haters sit on their couches and call you a bum lol
Man, I feel for him. He's outclassed Periera in 80% of their 3 fights but is somehow 0-3. Unfortunately power punchers always have the ultimate equalizer.
here before the izzy haters
“I didnt get knocked out I just hurt my leg”
