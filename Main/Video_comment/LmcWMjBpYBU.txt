Love this channel and would love to see more VR headsets teardowns
so satisfying
Bro burnt 1000 grandma's love 😅
“Scheduled text messages”. There is on iPhone. I’m confused? I usually set them the night before my friends birthdays so they get them first thing in the morning without waking them up when I’m watching videos at 02:00 😂😂 (click + and click send later)
0:32 Dude looks like a comic book character. Like the original Arthur from The Tick maybe? Or someone from Metal Gear? Something specific that I can't quite remember...
8:08 Happened in September the same year (seven months later).
Cool to hear your team are working on wheelchairs. That's an interesting and valuable industry to be in.
Tears of loneliness, LMAO!
Why do you have a tape on your thumb?
Ok now I see the reason why it's 3500$. What a complex machine
This video scarred me mentally
More like knitted with "love" of 1000 Asian kids😂
They have scheduled text messages now
Funny title “ITS PLASTIC!!”
8:07 Welllll..?
this is painful
Your sponsored content features the most overpriced battery banks I've ever seen by a huge margin. Like 3-4x the price compared to similar products from other brands
@buggaming5346
@stingoanimation
Expensive garbage  You just paying for a brand name
It seems like apple are a bit of a rip off and overexposed,overpriced and overrated I'm an android guy anyway.
$3500 tech ruined by a coin. 😮‍💨
Note 7 , this time by Google
Satisfaction
Nice to know people have $3500 to throw away lol
Hey Jerry guess what? You can do scheduled text messaging now 😅😮
one day i'll be rich enough to buy expensive shit like this
NO WAY!!! Plastic?!? Why didn't they make in with paper?!? This is unbelievable!
YOUUU SO GOOD
Time to clean the desk?😅  Tears of loneliness 😢😂
Did you get Apple Care?
As an apple user, this hurts to see
I hate when I drop my Vision Pro in a fire that’s the worst😂
They have scheduled text messages now. You converted yet?👀
Jerry was the kid whos parents wouldnt get them expensive things bc he would break it. glad to see it pays well
Can’t wait for the bend test of the IPhone air
R$3500 DOLAR NISSO NAO VALE AFF
Imagine having an oculus headset and it's still made of plastic and not glass, for 3500 dollars
Moving lenses inside couple dozen cameras all operate in sync. Amazing. New one coming soon.
Hii I'm from India can you please help me I am a student and I don't have any phone right now I need a phone for my studies can you please help me to provide me your tested phone please 😢
3:13 I love paying so I can pay to fix the stuff that I payed for 🥰
With the love of 1000 grandmas😅😂
Im pretty sure apple didn’t create it to survive a storm or a tornado btw
a garbage costing 3500$
Vision Pro for Apple Lovers :D
WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MUCH THERMOPASTE
who would stand by a campfire wearing that
After he started peeling off the plastic around the lenses i forgot it was worth 6k au when i saw it has a expensive  plastic bag under the fabric i thought it was from temu
Apple will surely improve. It has been improving day by day and year by year.
if it won't be implanted into my skull and make me Cyberpunk tier cyborg I'm not paying 6 747,20 usd for this thing (this is how much it cost in my country).
This thing seems made with cheap materials
the yapple vision pro
Scheduled texts exist-
Removing the outer plastic front cover felt like peeling an apple. Poetry.
Always a pleasure to see 12 months rent going under the jerry knife. Love/hate your videos =)
플라스틱이면 정비하면서 못 쓰잖아.. 애플아 이게 맞아?
0:05 Jerry asserting dominance by ignoring the pull tab
Don't know why it took me until today to subscribe, I love your videos!
if anyone asks you why do boys break their toys and the answer "to see what's inside" seems hard to believe... show them the video of jerryrigeverything tearing down the apple vision pro.
This is an early preview of the real life Hitman VR. Starring Jerry and his apple vision.
9:52 your patience earns you money 😂 its measurable
He lied about the thumbnail. That does not happen on a level 3 :(
Most people : "You cant smell videos or images!!" 3:39 : whats that smell? oh i see...
Crazy how quickly everyone forgot about this
Haha. They now have scheduled text messages!! 8:07
Wtf why did you do that
every time i hear the aluminium get scratched i just i cant :sob:
3:46 Amazon fire collab with vision poo
Why would anyone take an exacto knife to a product!!!
He said girth
the yarn burning was very unfun to watch :[
I guess you can switch back to Apple because they have scheduled text now
that "new thing" this is starting is the matrix, however it was already started by the other visors that have existed for much longer and were also already very popular.
I’m shivering
is that Apple gore?
it hurts so much watching you break stuff like this
im literally in pain watching this
Ya or a tube for those of us with a hard disability it maybe could pulse up and down to alleviate pint up energy.
esto duele tanto
Honestly, if the vision pro had beat saber, that's when I'd consider saving fir it
It’s not good for apple
Can you please please stop like scratching your knife across like every tech you destroy please
Jerry casi pierde el dedo pulgar desarmando el Apple Vision Pro
4.21 sounds like chalkboard being scratched 😭
ohhhhh noooooo
Apple team trying to ensure Jerry can’t rig the next build. 😅
They have scheduled text messages now
My screen got scratched from watching the video
Why
I feel sick to my stomach this monster just completely demolished this $3500 piece of tech with zero remorse  You are a monster  (obviously all of this is a joke. I’ve support your videos and plan on continuing to)
Plz give this to me it’s not available in my country love from india big fan sir you are doing good job plz sir I am a student plzzzzzzz❤❤❤❤❤
it's not a love of 1000 grandmothers... It's a touch of 1000s of tiny Chinese hands, working overtime... Also the amount of that thermal paste on each chip  😐
iJustine still exists? I kinda thought she went to space or something after never appearing again in Annoying Orange.
Four different types of fasteners? Taking this thing apart is like doing an oil change on an Audi.
this is one of the most painful sounds i have heard
2:58 this hurt to watch
Why don’t u wear gloves
11:33 no way this is really funny XD
Being able to watch someone destroy something you can't even afford is definitely a luxury😅
8:10 Something that would be introduced 4 months later with iOS 18.
I love that the "Jump Ahead" feature shows up when he starts scratching the aluminum 😂
how does Jerry even afford this
3:20 looool that will scratch so easily
:(
@4:10 they are saying that is "recycled yarn". For all that money, they could have used RENEWABLE wool yarn. It wouldn't burn or stink since it is fireproof and naturally anti-microbial
😢😢😢😢
13:19 RP1 reference??
😢we
Hi jerry
They tried to be like Ready Player One but Apple is not a gaming platform so that’s why They didn’t do so good.
I love how your titles are straight to the point. Not like, "I scratched the Apple Vision Pro, and you'll never guess what happens next!"
a top spec rtx 4090 pc and a vr headset from oculus or meta  or a apple vision pro
8:16 THEY HAVE SHECDULES TEXT MESSAGES NOW
8:09  and now... they do have scheduled text messages, haha
That thing will catch on fire. It should be illegal
😅😅😅😅thousand grama
1:12 With a 1000 grandmas 😂
I want to see Zack get into electric component recycling, since he ‘inspects’ stuff and breaks them for a living.  Like so he can see the suggestion.
8:07 we actually do have that now… is Zack finally an Apple user!?
After testing it what you will be doing with the broken one ?
Soooooo...its CHEAP AS F***😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I'm so tired of hearing "made of recycled material" on supposed high end devices.
I hate apple but the engineering and construction of the inside of this thing is insane.
idk if I can get through this whole video. I think I might throw up ot something. how can he be so violent?
Apple was like: Plastic scratches, glass breaks. Why not combine them!
This hurts me physically and emotionally
Vision Pro, which covers up 80 percent of your peripheral vision. Bay, hay, who needs alertness when you see like a Pro?
Oops accidentally drop it twice 9:31
Apple has scheduled messages and emails now. So now you have to be a man of your word and switch to the iPhone
dang bro
They should have made a cheaper variant without the eye projection gimmick. So much extra hardware and software for what? Was that a social engineering exercise?
the noises should be considered a method of torture 😭
How is bro doing this so calmly 3:51
😢😢😢
Oh yea! 10:02
Hey why did u crashed all the things
They have scheduled text messages now!
I saw an app for immersive videos called NOC NOK. It features pretty girls and is quite enjoyable.
It looks like you got an old Sega megadrive controller glued to your face.
Tears of loneliness 😢😢 5:48
This is torture (4 ur wallet and brain)
lmao tears of loneliness , hit them hard with that one x)
it hurts
I hate apple so much
So satisfying
Kinda satisfying watching this dude destroy overpriced crap 😂
This is horrible to watch.
bro I cant watch this video
6:59 Those internals look really cool. I wish they sold one with clear plastic on the inside.
Dude what it looks so premium but its made of worse materials than any iphone Apple needs to do better (as in lower prices, more premium devices)
If you didn't want it why didn't you just give it away
As someone that hates apple i enjoyed this and this deserves a like
Its sad that you sell jars of dirt and people buy it. Wild world we live in
and now it's discontinued^^
I wonder what these would cost bon the dark web . I need me a pair but not paying retail usa prices
‏اتنمر مك ليلة سعيدة لم يا أخي bye ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
‏نام أخي حبيبي أنت عسل ❤
Now that there’s scheduled text messages wanna switch to the Apple side? 8:25
Honor magic v3
Anker has actually been a straight up W. Wish you got DBrand to collab with them for skins too :P
Jerry, do you use different scratcher tips or one only?
BRO I CANT EVEN GET A META QUEST 3 AND YOU DO THIS IM JUST IN PAIN😢😢😢
I really wonder why they use plastic to laminate the glass. If it’s for drop resistance then why isn’t it done on phones as well? I tend to drop those more frequently than a device attached to my head with a head strap. Don’t get me wrong in wanting this for a phone because I don’t. This lets me remember the coating issue of the Mac book pro in 2013/2014. Scratches al over the screen just by wiping it with a soft cloth.
I don't get the concern about the lense...  "Keys or coins" - are you wearing JNCO jeans to stuff this thing in your pockets or do people dangle keys next to their face as a some weird as fuck hobby? I dunno, trying to understand the concern here.
Cam you give me q vision pro for free
Stop please 😭😭
Great video, I definitely won't put this in the same pocket as my keys 🫡
10:04 vision pro crying 😌
I hope apple’s watching this
Now send it back to apple for a repair
you cant play VR games with this
They have scheduled texts lol
Hi
0:37 🤏🤏🤏
bro warumm?
I won’t be buying this. It’s a novelty
Who came here because of beluga?
😮😮😵😵😭 bro please give me one mobile
I am feeling really sad to watch it. Because I just changed my phd research topic due to unavailable resources. One of them was a headset also
I find it funny how he insults Apple while casually destroying the vision pro
the audacity 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So, Apple doesn't care about Repair Accessibility?
You cannot physically focus on the lens, it will just look dirty or blurry
The solo knit strap is the worse one, dual band is way more comfortable.
Apple - you are a calm monster
X
😅
😂
I bet there will be teams in tech giants called Jerry proof
Repair nightmare
It’s like an onion. 🧅
@jerryrigeverything Apple now has EVERYTHING you want now, INCLUDING SCHGEDULED TEXT MESSAGES!
Im confused on the (most durable phone) your disappointed its glass instead of plastic and here you’re disappointed its plastic instead of glass. What am i missing?
Someone dream is someone trashing 🥲
Jokes on you they have scheduled text messages now
Bro is just FUNNY while acting like nothing ever happened 😂😂
$3500, for the 35 people who would them...
she should have done a scratch test on the camera and see how much small scuffs degraded the image.
Im to broke to be watching this video
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
They’ve got scheduling text now   lol
the box looks great.but the product itself looks so cheap to me assuming the sounds it make when in contact with jerry's knife🤣🤣
Aaaand now the iPhone has scheduled text messages lol
this hurts
oh hey IOS 18 is out and look what we have scheduled text messages so what are you gonna do?
8:08 hold up, have you seen the new ios 18 update? time for an iphone i guess
Knife is only $15, but shipping is $20 minimum. *sad norwegian noises*
Hey Jerry, so I’ve been doing this thing where I watch videos of people who own the Apple Vision Pro or review mainstream gadgets like it because I’m really wanting to own one myself. When I tried on the Vision Pro at my first Apple Vision Pro Walkthrough, it sold me. I have a powerful gaming PC that I’m sure you’d have much better use for, especially if you’re a gamer. I know you’re a gamer, but unfortunately, I don’t use my gaming PC much at all. I went to a Reddit forum where people sell PC parts, PCs, and camera equipment to see if anyone would be interested in buying my PC. Even if you know someone who’s in the market for a PC, it would mean the world to me if you replied to my message. I hope to use the money I make from selling this PC to buy a Vision Pro so I can watch movies, concerts, and my favorite TV shows, and experience Apple spatial computing 😊.
Be careful burning that stuff. You're gonna get ass cancer.
they have scheduled text messages
But most importantly, how does it work on Grindr?🌈👃🏾👄👈👀
I've never felt so agonized in a video before.
He’s finally complimenting apple
😐
Yo who's watching in 2033? 👽👽👽
people who buy this type of stuff really dont care about their money. unless its a youtuber of course but depends on how the youtuber spends it and not just on food for some dumb trend and waste the food
Well iPhone now has scheduled text messages LOL, gonna switch now? @8:07
A thousand cuddly grandma’s. Warm and fuzzy on a level only known to baby bunnies and kittens.
my 'go to' when it comes to speed when watching any YT videos is 2x - exception being Zack's videos!
yo sufro viendo esto
8:09    Umm, they scheduled text messages now!! iOS 18 .. back to apple 🍎 you go   🤣🤣🤣
Bro got me looking like this 😬
"Feels like it's been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas"
As of yesterday, you can now do scheduled text messages on iOS phones. Happy days.
8:13 well sheduled messages dropped with ios 18 today. what color 16 pro will you be getting?
6:20 ILLEGAL GRIP.
8:07 JerryRigEverything IN IOS 18 THEY HAVE THAT!
For 3500 there’s no reason they didn’t use the sapphire glass they use on iPhones
So it's basically high quality trash.
after seeing this I going to get therapy and a psychologist after seeing you break a nice piece of technology to pieces 😢
The Apple Vision Pro.... Oh no.
They DO have scheduled text messages now 😂 !
0:02 _the yapple vision pro_
This is completely false, it’s not plastic,
I am to poor to watch this videos
8:08 Time to go back to apple 😂
Holy moly it only took 6 moths for it to flop
The The The The The
I hate this guy 😂
10:03  sends shivers      Down my spine 😣
Apple is charging you $800 to fix the plastic cover on the front of that thing…  This is so depressing, I really hope Apple loses millions on this scam of a product
😂😂😂 molan los vídeos nunca me cansaré de ver esto
Your father never told you never to cut towards yourself. Yeash, your videos give me anxiety.
Im not angry i mean he can destroy any product he likes. Im happy for him.  hes just doing his job❤
8:10 Heh, scheduled text messages are coming in iOS18
This is murder
8:07 GO BACK TO IPHONE!!! iOS 18 HAS IT
Turns out it is a big flop lol
Whats going on 😮😮😮😮😮
Can we have a vision pro teardown please?
''Tears of loneliness'' had me wheezing. 🤣🤣
It’s hard to watch him scratching the glass of the Apple Vision Pro
I died watching this
I...i can't watch this, i thought i could but i can't 😅
He called me broke me in 1000ways
apple is trying everything to grab money literally
tear down?
iOS 18 has scheduled text messages, Ready to come back to iPhone?
Jerry, samsung galaxy ring please
imagine buying something so expensive and the outside material is plastic, apple is the king LMAO
¿Como que pro?
The Apple Vision Pro now released to the UK, Canada, France, Germany and Australia. It cost £3,499 in the UK.
Now take it back to apple and say you dropped it
He sees others dream as toy
Cant wait to see VR take over phones
a highschool girl could destroy the vision pro even more
._.      3500$ bro
6:06 OH GOD, WHY IS WALDO IN TEN PIECES!?
Tears of loneliness 💀
im not really an apple vision pro guy but this IS $3,500 in your hands that you're just casually scratching and denting.  this... is just... eugh. huge waste
@A2DChannel bro neenga epo open panna poringa?
Me rn 😢😭
Hii, please do a review of Microsoft Holo lens 2
8:58 ONE PIECE??!!!??
Very rich
umm what 11:34
WHAT THE 5:52
they have scheduled messages now
I'm out for the scratching noise
As a DIEHARD Apple user and a Mac consumer, I can confirm that the Apple Vision Pro is amazing but expensive.
Apple are the company that will say "whoops we destroyed ma😮nkind. Saweee, we just wanted to make money 😭" I support capitalism, I don't support extremism, extortion  or extinction.
zach predicting scheduling messages?? it also gets rcs 🎉🎉 (after 5 years of it existing)
Did you spend $3500 on this just to destroy it. Or was this a given sponsee review and you just destroyed it 😂 either way. Hope w/e sponsors you get you get or ad rev covers the cost of burning money (products) otherwise you do some wild stuff just for views.
Sup egg
I forgot about the Vision Pro
They do have scheduled text messages and rcs. :)
sliding it onto the table full of Iphone corpses was a real power move
Bro roasted everyone 😂😂😂
Anyone else see the boxcutter move at 5:40?
There is a function for people who doesn’t have hands you can control the Apple vision two if your eyes
Good news my friend IOS 18 Scheduled text messages
8:08 finally you what you asked for now you can do scheduled text messages
Jerry we got scheduled texts!
It’s only $3500 because they knew how few people compared to others would actually buy it and they said they’re working on the next one before this one even released.
anyone here after WWDC 2024?
9:01 The One Piece is real
This didnt age well. It flopped hard lol
I'm not spending 4,000 dollars on that... 💀 I'm sticking with my 1,200 dollar PC, Apple should make their devices accessible to lower income peeps
I think you pretty much explained it. The reason for the plastic on the outside is to prevent shattering of the glass. So if you drop them, would you rather it have a few scratches, or be completely shattered?
Hho is watching from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
JerryDestroyEverything
❣️
These are hard core videos. I am only looking with half an eye open and sweat all over 😫
Tears of loneliness 😂😂 5:45
1:54 Meta quest 3 has left the call
Apple be like: We are proud for you to not be able to repair all and any of our products
Needs narration from Beevis and Butthead . . .
Please try meta quest 3
bro is eating his 3000$
Repairability is NOT an afterthought with apple. In fact, i think NOT being able to repair your PURCHASED products is the first thing on their mind
This was a fantastic breakdown. Thanks for hopping on the live grenade (pricepoint) to save us all with knowledge.
This my dream😢
5:46 tears of loneliness😭
Fun fact: nobody comes here to observe build quality.
Remember back in 2004 Panasonic DVD recorders (VCR form factor not computer ROM drive) cost $4 Grand? Yeah, they’re only a couple hundred bucks now.
8:07 ✌
Although I am a huge apple fan I enjoyed this very much. Thank you
Bro what is wrong with these people
Bro buys 3500$ tech, only to destroy it! 🤯🤯
Vcl
Imagine the man hours poured into mining the materials, refining them, producing molds, designing the engineering and casing and advertising, the manufacturing testing and production.. The lives sacrificed for this incredibly gorgeously constructed extremely expensive and basically useless redundant product. Just like... why? To squeeze more ads in front of your eyes and daily life? What a waste for everyone involved. Innovation is dead, capitalism killed it.
Cashier : it's gonna be $3500 do you want a bag for that? Jerry : No thanks anyway, I plan on destroying them.
OK now really impress us by putting it back together and seeing if it works?  🤣
*aluminium
He hasn't unwrapped the battery bank yet and the Vision pro is already destroyed 😂
10:03 it sounded weird, More weirder than me moving my hand up and down on my laptops frame
the more he destructs it the more it looks like the glasses from incredibles 2.
do they have a bucket shaped version of headsets? makes it easy to wear to watch for longer durations.
Apple copying everything else years later and over priced is wild 🤣🤣🤡
0:07 NO YOU DID NOT JUST CUT THE PULL TABS NOOO
Why are you destroying a 3,500$ item… but satisfying vid
watthours should be the standard for battery capacity, it would make capacity comparison easier and remove confusion.
Only jerry buys a 3400$ vision pro to destroy it
It's garbage 🤣
This is the only practical use for an Apple Vision Pro.
The engineering that apple has done in this is incredible
"Yapple"
The scratch on the outside should not affect your view of the world though. What you think is the real world seen through the vision pro is actually rendered to your eyes, with the information collected from the front cameras
This time i watching this at a time of 3:14 AM at night
Jerry fits with the Vision Pro tbh 0:32
Next time you should try scratching china glass bridge...😂
Good thing I won’t have a fire by it
i enjoyed the video
I know its not my money, and i dont like apple. but this hurts whenever Jerry damage it lol.
Not designed for repair yet they have no problem selling you a 500$ repair plan lol … that checks out.
i m about to cry you don't have march 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another BS scratching video… Keep scratching cell phones
Sadly it's always a choice between the scratch resistance of glass and the crack resistance of plastic.
The real def of ripped
"oh crap I forgot to record"
Wear this about on a hot summers day and it will be stinking and stink in no time.
Que le pasó a tus manos ???
Apple should be designing robots, not crappy toys.
In a way, I am glad this product is $3500 USD. The amount of plastic waste (and waste in general) this thing generates once new generation devices become available, is insane. By the way, anyone using this, just looks like a cartoon Italian while they pinch the air. Hilarious. 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤏🤏🤏🤏
fkN dope.... let finish then peep
Well, the USB-C spec has two different provisions to have screws to hold it in. But Fruit-Brand gonna Fruit-Brand.
Grand canyon level groves gives me life
Bruh disolved Apple
I see a creacher in that screen
It has termal paste yet designed to be not opened.
I just like watching another pointless garbage Apple product destroyed. Thank you.
doesn't look like eco friendly
I've always envied people who destroy expensive electronic devices without a moment's hesitation. The reason I switched from iPhone to Galaxy was also influenced by this YouTuber. So I am always grateful. This YouTuber measures and reviews the degree of damage caused by direct external and internal impacts rather than performance. I think this is really interesting because it is different from other YouTubers.This was 10422 Jeong Jae-hyun.
*cries in poor*
impressive build. Shame they lock it inside to make repair almost impossible.
Watching him destroy it makes me shake. That cost a lot money
This is half as bad as watching gore.
Came here from the Eddie Burback video… I’m now in love with this channel
What a Great Voice!!
😂😂 suara yang menyenangkan telinga 😊😊
i usually love these videos but the price point of this makes this so painful to watch. gotta see it through tho
seeing this man permanently break an entire headset is pain
If you came from tiktok, good for you, hope you're having a good day
careful, this thing is made out of plastic! it would've been made of structural steel but it actually weighs something on your face.
Everyone keeps talking about apple vision pro, even though Microsoft first came with the idea Hololens 1& 2 back in 2019, hope someone makes a video on that
Wow, can't even clean the fans if they get dusty
im waiting for video about meta quest 3
I can't watch this because of the sounds of the scratches. My body is literally convulsing.
En español!!!
Looks boring. Chunky piece of useless crap. Why I need to ruin good scenery with windows95? Thank you apple. Good thing is you atleast get big tan lines from goggles. Just send it to warranty as it is with letter it just broke.
what di you expect it to be made of? titanium?
imagine paying 3500 for plastic and aluminum
what shampoo do you use bro???
Mi sta chiancennu u cori …
Nevermind, i don't like apple stuff either
Surgery fail
Brother, you destroy it like this, brother😅 Open the battery pack
i really like the idea of double blink as an option for alternative to tapping
No oculus reviews?
What if, if jerry forgot to record this vdo😂
I am just waiting for Google and Samsung's response to the Apple vision at a fraction of the cost.$3500 is really hard to swallow for this device. Sad part is that google came out with the google glass years ago. It never took off because people said how ridiculous it looked. Yet we have this monstrosity. Go figure.
I wish I had the money to destroy the Apple Vision Pro after buying it.
လီၤသးဆါ
เสียดาย😢
el video me está doliendo por alguna razón
this hurts to watch. i hate everything about apple and appreciate the teardown but jeez
Waste of money just to destroy it. Kids in africa could have eaten that headset.
The only person that can destroy the most expensive VR headset 😂
Tears of loneliness😂
never watching you again
Seeing as it's Apple there's no surprise that these things are so expensive no normal person can afford them.
As an student of engineering i must say" OUCH!!!"
Sir make on RayNeo X2 teardown
ఏ ప్రొడక్ట్ సిగ్గు తెయ్యలంటే ని తరవాతే నయ్య జెర్రీ 😂
It's costs alot
Y are you destroying this beautiful machine.
$3500 gone in less than 15 minutes.
Hi sir… That’s vision Pro cost is my one year salary.. but you are great bro just 13 minutes. It’s smash really you are great bro….. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
new sub.  very informative.  thanks for vid.
Why he trying to sound like lock picking lawyer
All this sounded very expensive I don’t know if it supposed to be satisfying or worse than a iPhone ring tone
There goes 3500$ down the drain
How can i setup the external camera for more quality? ( 240p at now )
i learnt quite a few things , and its not about vr lol
knife work is scary
Someone at Apple, please give this man 'Scheduled Messages'
Girthy
Its good that it's plastic tbh. Less weight on your head. I hate heavy  headsets. It's probably very high quality even if it's plastic.
algunos quisiéramos ese producto pero solo en nuestros sueños, me dolio mucho como lo destruiste
Es adictivo ver como destruye las cosas de Apple 😂
I wish I could get up lol but love the videos hope you win the lawsuit
Just discovered this channel. Loved the content! Relaxing and Satisfying tech destruction for informational purpose. *Fun fact, at 2X speed, voice sounds exactly like the Lockpick Lawyer.
JerryRig having a green bubble is just not a hill worth dying on dude.
Todo eso es plástico 😒😒
😂i think apple warranties are still covered 😅
If you intend to fix this: dremel with plastic polish and a fluffy wheel will work
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥹🥹😭
10:02 what's that material called?
Dhokra ....
Knitted with love of a thousand grandmas😂 1:11
4:51 THE LENSES ARE PLASTIC?!?!  Congratulations you just bought a $3,500 View-Master.
Hopefully he will recover the expenses from this video view count😮
Any a2d boys here😅🙌
Coming back to the video after the crack in the middle fiasco
luv it, hahaha
well , watching this guy fu.... ing it up the entire goggle then he might making lot of money to do that , but to his point, makes it very cheap and then we wonders why the apple guys got so filthy rich.
Abe pagal h kya,
больно на это смотреть на самом деле ахаха
Amazing Jerry 👏👏👏
Me: struggling to pay 200€ debt, bro destroying 3500€ hardware :D
Worst product in the world 😐
The click movement instantly struck me as unfriendly too
ابدااااع❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢
I never had that much goosebumps until now
The design looks awful. People wearing them look like they came from a cheap sci fiction movie from the 70s. Is not sexy at all. Good luck Apple selling that piece of tech! I am not convinced.
You unboxed it a bit deeper😂😂
Treat a consumer product like a consumer product, not like a military grade equipment - leading titles may give you more viewers , but doesn’t do well with your credibility!! For a product with aluminium housing and Mirror Polished glass - you are calling it plastic !! Use some sense - no other product are reviewed with a military knife !!   I don’t know what’s you obsession with using knife on Apple product - use it on your self !!
Que sentido tiene destruír ...esa cosa ...es una cachetada  ala pobreza
Imagine what it will be like in another decade
Bro destroyed the 3500$ vision pro😮
i was like ooooooohhhhhhh my......
Please give me this 😢😢😢
Next time before you break it let me play with it 😅😂❤
😥
Apple care se pronuncia apl ker no apl car bro 🤭 saludos
interesting to view many devices inside. Your videos are great for shure. But everytime destroy a new device is damn crazy too 🙂 many plastic here, yes. Don't know who wants to work in VR only. I use VR since 3 years, you can work also nice in steamVR or WMR but the ting is VR gaming!
Psikopat 😂
Apple fans look away 😂
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Que piensa Apple de este video ?
it is so painful to wwatch him destroy a very very expensive apple product but is also very soothing.
Cyber psychos are real
These thing makes people look stupid.
Can I watch you rig a car
my tears flowing a part after seeing the identation test, shit
Bahut badiya🎉
How do you afford this stuff?
You rigged it all apart lol
A lot of people watching him destroying this item, can't afford it 😢
Watching this hurt not gonna lie
David di sini lewat

Oh my god you destroyed 3500 dollar's glasses 😮😮
3500 $ ..... this was HARD to Watch!!!
Crazy
What’s ironic is that I got the MacBook “made to last aluminium” advert
I saw this video, and I don't felt pity, for me is the gadget most useless thing for this year
❤
I need it …. Why???
Please rename the channel to JerryWrecksEverything - my heart can't handle the metal scrapes 😮😮
Other apple sh*t, nice video!
The headset is a perfect plan for apple. They made it so they could show it could be done by them, and it’s so expensive so only certain people will buy and test it. I bet in 2 years they will make another one for way cheaper and it’s gonna go crazy😭
I  think that this product would never have released (like this) if Steve jobs was alive. He would just bully and workplace harass the engineers until they made it smaller.
Meta Quest is asking: em i a joke for you?  The apple vision is not the first generation of VR Headsets and nothing special only the price tag is very special, specially expensive.
I love how messy the table is :D
This is one of the cruelest videos I have ever seen...

പുതിയ കളിപ്പാട്ടം എന്ത് കിട്ടിയാൽ ഉടനെ പൊളിച്ച് എല്ലാം പുറത്തെടുക്കുന്ന jerry അണ്ണൻ ആണ് എന്റെ മകളുടെ HERO😊

Hello jerry, is there any way to talk to you or any means to contact you, greetings

the fact that this is handmade put together by machine and human is crazy...
Bro just threw away $3500 when I can't even pay my $500 car payment...damn..
🙌
Won't buy these, I'm so lonely that I'll make it short out.
Where do you get the kid that has the hardness level when you scratch the screen?
i took way too much joy in thinking about the horrified faces of all the apple fanboys watching this video
what if some one does not have a hand
You need to mute the mic when you scratch that with a knife. That was the worst sounr ive ever heard
If Your A YouTube Bot Raise Your Hand ✋
It's tough watching this🥲
Wtf you want bro😢
Sue apple for flase advertisement and make money
Funny reading all the comments of people defending apple 🍎
Soo satisfying 😊
8:55 jerry cutting it like a 🥭 🤧😂
Buen peinado
They look horrible, and the name
Jerry with your throngs of fans, I’d be curious if you would do some testing on DWe? Drum Workshop electric kit. Quite a new revolution in electronic drums. Just curious if it would interest you.
JELEMA GELO SIA
Amazing , visualisasi

Thumb up for the part at the end when you make suggestion for accessibility
10:02 Listen with headphones

Bro I didn't expect it durability test and teardown on single video you wasted 3500 dollars for single video 😢
Ada gommala 😢
Abang Jerry Gila sih 😂😂😂 semua barang yg di review dihancurin semua....😂😂😂
Jerry rig from haryana: kei soudaa hai yoo khindaadonga 😂😂 Like if you agree😅
Apple  comenzó a hacer chinos. Basuras.
This might just be the first product you tear down that was just as useless before the teardown as it was after it.
This guy has life dicked.
Hi❤
I swear apple is on constant decline and samsung just be on the way forward
Best buisness write off ever!!!
Adangomalla😮😢
I wouldn't even damage one of those devices, it looks too expensive.
So evil Bro😂
Sometimes I wondered if Apple would ever consider to build a fan on their iphone as well since iphone heat up so quickly
@a2d soldiers 😂❤ ippidi oru video venum 😂😂🤣🤣
I Get it , such a large and thin piece of unprotected glass in front of your face is probably unsafe, so they had to encase it in plastic to pass safety , and if they left out the glass entirely , then it would just be a PLASTIC TOY , right ?. But the end result .....marketing gone mad:  They invented something with all the disadvantages of GLASS and PLASTIC is stead of the other way around. Just to be able to call it a glass front.
bro spent a black market kidney on this. Even though he destroyed it he should get his money back for spending it on doo doo fart
Si dañarla no le cuesta nada regaleme una 😢
Against smoking anything 💀
Plz donate me a iPhone
Que comparación más tonta he ilógica
@a2d

👏 toma tu like bro
This was excruciating to watch. Very interesting, but excruciating. 😆
Satisfaction level while watching to damaging  this shit product is next level 😌
😂😂😂😂
Did anyone really expect good material quality?
If u give the product to me I will be thankful to my life
Am Ende bleibt Elektroschrott. Wird sich das durchsetzen? Hoffentlich nicht.
Such a relaxing vid
i felt this teardown, it hurt. that poor vision pro.
😢😢😢😢
3500 dollars down the drain.
😢😢😢
Abe sale 😢
Grand Canyon level of grooves 😂😂
Bro just destroyed 4000$ in seconds😂
Instead of disintegrating the parts. You can give it to whom cannot afford it.
എന്റെ പൊന്ന് ജെറി അണ്ണാ 🙏🏽
essa merda aqui no brasil ta custando 40 mil.
Jerry be like: le moot diya tere 4 lakh pe🤣
When he begins torturing pricey goods, I always hold my breath. He is definitely a psychopath; the only thing that makes this particular object different is that it is an object 😐
Thought this video is from dark web 😮😮😮😢😢😢
The best Review on the planet 😮 this review costs 3500 $

-3500$
You are wearing Casio watch w91
Nice
Ha valido la pena 😤
Imagine someone robbing the apple store and using the apple vision pro and a mask to hide there identity 😂
‏‪9:35‬‏  But don't worry, my patience is immeasurable
One of the smoothest transition to sponsors I've seen recently
You are so hilarious bro. Thank you for this. Very well done. I now appreciate it even more. Absolutely incredible invention and my absolute favorite way to watch anything right now. It makes my 65 inch TV looks like a piece of crap. I always wanted my own IMAX. Now I have my own IMAX that I can watch it on the moon lol. The fact that this will be the worst one that they ever make is absolutely insane. One day they will make it so it’s a complete screen on the inside not too eyeholes, and you’ll be able to interact with other people wearing it, and they will make it lighter, and all kinds of amazing things. it’s definitely the future.   I’m highly impressed. It’s stupid expensive but if you think of it as a really nice computer and a bad ass TV to boot, that you can take ANYWHERE , it makes sense.
galavapu kaali tika matadenna
the one only Lord Jerry, satisfying to look at this video
Very sad😢
bro just mad on it😂
Give me some money bro 😢 iam really poor. I can't really afford iphone x.
ഇതുപോലൊരെണ്ണം വാങ്ങാൻ പോയിട്ട് കാണാൻ പോലും പറ്റാത്ത ഞാൻ   പൊളിച്ചു കരയുമ്പോൾ ഒരു സങ്കടം 😔😔🥹🥹🥹🥹
എനിക്ക് ഇത് ഒന്നും കാണാൻ വായ്യെ 😢❤️‍🩹
❤❤
Jerry, my opinion is that what Apple have come to realise is that they are mocking those who buy the Apple Vision Pro. And on top of that, this mockery, also costs $3500. I wouldn't give that kind of money for anything in the world, moreover, in Europe, this mockery costs even more, 5000-6000€. Congratulations, Jerry for "opening our minds" and being more realistic, when buying various things.  Greetings from a fan in Romania!✌️✌️💪💪
🤣🤣🤣
Estos en una prueba de cuanto dinero tiene
Of course it’s going to scratch your using an X-Acto knife
You just ruined a $3500 headset
I usually hate to watch objects being destroyed but i enjoyed this a lot, i guess i have a issue with overly-overpriced things from a company that is just gaslighting people into buying things that will make the world a even sadder place.
How easy it was to put Sapphire crystal lenses in this device instead of these cheap plastic lenses I'm disappointed they will be scratch in a month if not care properly
Most magnificent teardown so far - 3.5K $ of premium Apple gear successfully Jerryrigged😁🤘
if you getting these for free pls dont destroy pass it to me i will keep it
raffle an apple vision pro
hahahaha all reviewers said about apple vision pro Woww amazing.. but in jerryrigeverything noob..plastic glass 😂😂😂😂😂
Me duele ver una Visión Pro destrozarse y quemarse.
Deyyyy😊
R63 000 ripped into pieces like that🙄
His passion for accessibility I admire
"It's plastic!" Yes, we need steel VR Goggles so the neck hurts like hell
I knew this was going to be great for Apple
om botak emang paling brutal
Like if you want a pro vision.
Those dual fans lookin wild 😂
👎🏻
5 millones a la basura XD
It's my dream to have that gadget. Can't afford tho. Can I have that instead? I'm not joking.
Ломать не строить
Bro is billionaire 💸
Jerry rig everything ❌. Jerry destroys everything thing✅.  at 3:30 He just burn rs 400000 lakh Indian rupees..😂

Yo viendo que lo rompe:REGALAMELO SI NO LO QUIERES.
y pensar que un chino le puso la voluntad para hacer ese apple watch :c
Why does it sound like ASMR?😂😊
Está de pelooosssss😮
I feel like it makes sense. Wouldn’t a scratched headset be cheaper and easier to repair than a shattered headset?
They were right , You do have "cutting edge"  technology
Damn didn't expect that 😢
Jerry rigged everything.
Thanks ❤❤❤
que estafa
"don't worry my patience is immeasurable"😂😂
muy buen video, pero me duele cuando lo rayas yo , que no tengo para comprar, uno y saber lo que cuesta me duele ver que rompas el tuyo com se le dice eso,, ponerte en tu zapatos jjaja,,,, primera vez en la vida que tube envidia de ese  objeto, porque vi a un usuario jugar honkai alli, ufff , fue espectacular
ഈ മനുഷ്യന് ഒരു നഷ്ട്ടവും ഇല്ല ഇതിൻ്റെ ഇരട്ടി പ്രതിഫലം ഈ വീഡിയോ വാഴി കിട്ടിയിട്ടുണ്ട്
Tu. No pruebas las cosas ,las dañas que es diferente ,no mas en la forma de dañar no desarmar salta ala vista
What is your problem bro?
I'm half expecting some apple fanboy to cry that he got an off brand model because of the plastic exterior screen lol
Better give it to me than on the damage😌
Ngoprek apple vision udah kek ngoprek HP mito 😭😭
Bro destroyed it without any hesitation
you need to be banned to buy others apple products
😂😂😂😂😂
Saya tidak mampu membeli dan menangis melihat ini
Apple is apple
Bro pls STOP!!!! 3500$ is one year of work with the minimun salary in my country. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
🔥ttam
I think apple community hate you😂😂
4:45 thumb is Injured 😔
Un video no puede doler!!! EL VIDEO!!
I have a condition with my eyes and have never been able to see in dark or dim environments. I’m curious to know if the Vision Pro could help me see in the dark like a normal human being would? That would be a lifechanger for many people like me.
por qué puedo escucharlo en español?
Pero porque no lo hacen como lentes normales, una verdadera gastadera de plata 🤣
You are a millionaire or you do not value. things but if you have the money I won't stop you😅😢
Tim cook is angry now😅
Working fine now ?
fun
Watching how Jerry turns the Vision pro to vision bro at 12 am is actually pretty satisfying.
00:00:08 seg "estos auriculares".... ?????? auriculares?!!!! WTF!
🥺💔
😅
This is satisfying 😂
You should get the hacksmith lightsaber lighter
Zack, you are such a troll, and I love it.
RIP headphone user’s ears
This video hurts me. 😭😭😭
Well the apple vision pro doesn't look so "pro" right now
Oh my goodness,😮😮, typical jerry thing❤😂
Apple Mask... I didn't say it... 🤷🏿‍♂️ Jerry did.

11:06  SELL THE CHIP 😂😂
QUE CHINGADOS HACES ME SENTI TAN MAL VIENDO EL VIDEO DISLIKE
Regalame lo así roto porfavor.
at last of the video ,where is apple dustbin ??
I'm not much of an Apple fan but the engineering that went into this product is pretty impressive.
Exelente video Rig buen desarme, increible el nivel de tecnologia que le puso Apple a esos lentes, igual su valor es altisimo
psuve
I am going on a 7 day vacation in dominican republic i will be wanting to record going to the beach and atv riding which one would be better for recording GOPRO Hero 12 - DJI Action 4 - IPhone 15 Pro Max

Wtf did you just do to it
Esto es una tortura ver como destroza esta genialidad de apple.!!😅
it hurts me to see this
Vision pro to Jerry: I am real Expensive!  Jerry: Shut you Mouth! And get Undressed!😅😅😅
Barang yang sangat saya mau tapi gak mampu belii🤧
the headband is not knitted from the love of a thousand grandmas, it's woven from the tears of a thousand children in apples sweatshops. watching this thing get destroyed was the most cathartic thing i've seen for a while.
Please someone tell me he recover all his money from this video 😮😅
Where is battery
So you buyed this for 3500$ just to destroy it for a video? I mean yeah you make a lot of money back from the video but wtf?!?!?!? Just wtf
everytime he move i shock a lot lmao
when I watched this I lost 3500$ that I didn't even have
I got chills throughout the video with the sound of scratching the product hahahaha
Nooooooooooooooooo jerry noooooo.
anjirr 55 jt itu di rusak gitu aja 😢
Watch 10:09
Jajajajaja las lágrimas de soledad
Please give me one. I have very little money and I want to at least enjoy something I never had. Please, I would be very excited if you gave it to me.🥲
This should have been called the ISight
He received amount 100 times more than this product. 😂😂😂
que descabellado producto bro..
It's shitty expensive thing
How rich is this guy
interesante 👍
lagrimas de soledad XD
Did anybody else find this painful to watch but still enjoyable?
Lo metes en arroz y aún se arregla
One man on planet earth can do this none other than Jerry
Please produce our short film
Ghana paisa he is bande ke pass
Китаец, который сделает тоже самое на коленке за 100$
abusadorrrrr
Tears of loneliness
cambien la voz de la pista de audio en español o pongan subtítulos en español. es muy irritante ese  actor de voz o ia.
People who pay 3500 $ for this crap need psychological help
How rich you are..........here jerryrigeverything comes
It is a remarkable piece of technology, extremely complex and it shows how bad the future economy of these things will be. There's no way we'll be able to make these things affordable, repairing them is practically almost impossible, and with all the components inside there's little room to drive costs down.
Bro why you start to destroy or just look how do they make a products things that Apple Vision Pro you bought it and start doing that ;-;
😅😅😅 ka hal chal hai
DISRTROY MONEY IN SOME MINUTE
Bet Apple designed the front glass specifically like that because they think people that can afford such a thing in the first place, can afford to pay $800 usd to replace it every time a fingernail scratches the front
ну ты и вандал =-=
Protective Sock💀
David gadgetin menangis melihat ini
Verte destruir algo que cuesta 400 veces mas que mi IPhone 7plus, duele un poco 😢😢
Imagine he forgot to record the video
😂 Love your way to describe the head band. 😂
15 Lakhs ka Program war gaya 😂
The more expensive the product, the more painful it is to watch 😭
Ya Allah si botak ber ulah😢😂
I came through insta reels 😭🤚
Channel names fits 100% to his actions. No offence.
Bro can you give me a vision pro please😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
@Gadgetin
Now let's see how much the repair bill would be if you sent it to Apple.
This made me cringe in ways I can't express in words.
I'm guessing after the review at 4:00 I probably shouldn't light my hair on fire while using this.
как только термопаста высохнит они сгорят !!! )
Must be nice just to destroy 4000$ I like your videos better when you building stuff to help your wife this is pointless
3500 dollars plus taxes... auch
a china vendo o video pra fazer o xiaomi vision pro kkkkk
duele ver el video jajajaja
que locura
It is 6300$ inside iran  🇮🇷 😂 And iPhone 15 pro max is 1250$ And iPhone 13 pro max is 2500$
there it goes $4000
Oh my God, I can't see this. I've always dreamed of owning one and here you are, ruining it. I can't stop watching
I would love to see the people who worked on this react
This guy is born to destroy😅
Even in Spanish sounds good this video
A man has just wasted 3,500 dollars in front of an audience
But why?😢
Do you know poop is coming
You could've gifted me that vision pro 🥲 But the video  is satisfying ngl!
11:17
So it's not really real time then
Waterproof test?
I'm glad this man have every intrusive thought I have.  I was about to say "What could make this man buy a 3500 dollars AR headset and destroy it like it's nothing", then I saw how smoothly the advertisement went...
Bro stop you gonna set fire in the house
JODER... CADA RAYON QUE LE DISTE ......ERA COMO UNA PUÑALADA EN MI CORAZON......
Братан, разбирать сложно технические устройства это не твое😂
This is one of his only videos that made me uncomfortable.
It is completely idiotic to scratch the glass and burn the material for a test. Who is a fool who doesn't know that the glass gets scratched and the fabric burns.It's actually a vandal test designed to make the creator money by primitive destroying an expensive device.😅😅😅😅
yaaaaa ampuunn mending buat gw aja deh bangbotak
Waiting until Samsung makes one before i buy it
Help😢😰😭😭😩
From this video he made around 30k dollars so he doesn’t care about what you can’t get
Kasih aku aja bro kalau gak mau ,hp aja aku cuma ada hp xiomi 2jutaan😢
Good work
Such a waste.
we want art class with jerry back
adamsin reis😂
K but it would actually be cool to see it disassembled carefully too
Skarching sound soooo iritating. 😂🤯😳🥴🥴🥴🥴.
Hello sir this is 6Lk for India rupees price 😂😂

"The lower cameras are covered with glass"💀
Who the F made that spanish audio sounds so bad it hurts fire that guy damn
Anjirr ngilu co
Az gören çocuğum için bunu kullansaö nasıl olur retinasındaki hasar sebebiyle sadece 10 cm den görebiliyor bu onun görüşünü artırabilirmi  parçalamak yerine ihtiyacı olan birine verebilirdi
Destroying what others want is a form of humiliation
Ahora desmontandolo que valor crees que deberían valer en el mercado ?
Your knife skills make me panic.   (Context, I'm a chef)
I'm from India, what ever u did really hurts 😢. Can you please give me that vision pro 🙏 for free.
Tu e rico ne mano 😂
Try with meta quest 3
Jerry never disappoint us❤
no soy fanatico de apple, pero como amante de la tecnologia, este video me provoca dolor y satisfaccion al ver como desmontan el dispositivo para ver su funcionamiento
apple doing stuff that will survive at max 1 year, classic
Don't get me wrong, gifted people or even common people won't use it because of the price.
Quá vip
Jerry arriving at Apple Support:   "It got wet and doesn't turn on anymore"   apple:🫠
At least it won't last long enough to cause brain cancer🤔
Dude, You just destroyed a year's worth of my meal cost
It’s as if a Nintendo 3ds and valve index had a baby
The way you are cutting 🥺💔 not feeling good 🥺😊
Wait till Apple gets to view this channel to see them bashing their products. 😂😂😂😂
WHY BRO? WHY? WTF
Konten yang tidak menguntungkan buat orang lain daripada kamu ngerusak barang mahal mending duitnya di sumbangin buat yang membutuhkan
Is it me, or seeing this thrash £3,500 or what ever this Apple gadget costs, felt so satisfying to see it get thrashed. 🤣🤣🤣
I like your flat expression while making mayhem to that 3,5K stuff while still giving a brief explanation to what your doing, like it.
I feel you with scheduled text messages.
Apple will say " when ch*d to sare kamm di 😂😂😂
مبزر
The pain is in the thumbnail 😢
Why put all that device if you can just put lens on eye , take all that device on caps
So from what I understand from your clips, you have the money to buy the hardness and durability test of everything hmmm
Can you please add hindi audio track , reading English subtitles is boring .
-$3000
why would you do that
Whats tic tok
Dia selalu merusak sesuatu yang tidak bisa saya beli .
even tho you destroyed it, can i have it?
Satisfying
👍
Feels like it's been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas. 😂
whyyyyyy
"knitted by the love of thousands grandma" you sure does now how to express it. ❤
wtf benefit of destroyed this $4000 !!!!! If you don't want this money give it to me I need to pay to my univ to complete my studies 💔
Imagine testing like this without recording it 😬
ROG ki astiya bhi nahi hatayi aur iska start kar diya :( 💀💀
11:49 I like how you destroyed the vision pro before you even unpackaged its battery 😅
RIP $3500
CrApple Sucks, and so do their users.
What a waste 😞 Apple send me one I won’t destroy it!
Ahhh Well There is a waste of money. Well it is a waste of money to buy one of these anyways.  Th8s is just a AR headset. Just by a Real VR headset you will get a better result from it.  This is just for Apple super fans.
This is no teardown. This a tearup 😮
Lo interesante no esta en el tamaño de los componentes, si no en la programación del lente, por ejemplo la lectura del movimiento de los ojos en relación con la dirección exacta en la que están observando, para simular que los ojos son un selector... es un algoritmo nuevo.... lo de las cámaras y la ubicación de las pantallas, medición de distancias memoria de espacio y todo en tiempo real....
Espero y ganes lo que perdiste en este video bro
Y bueno, nada de reparabilidad y el planeta nos lo agradece
Apple is panicking 😂
Yikes, it’s not even a glass either…
This thing cost a whole lot, isn't durable, isn't easily repairable, it's an expensive piece of shit !
Muchas gracias por doblar al español y asi disfrutar tus excelentes videos y pruebas Saludos desde colombia
Amazing how cheaply these huge companies make things,and charge up the ying yang for them...there's so many other materials besides plastic that could have been utilized with these, to make them 100x better. It's crazy how as technology get better and grows,manufacturing and quality of a device with that technology takes a huge door in quality.. that whole front shield could have been made from Gorilla Glass,and just that simple change would have made it amazing
Can’t wait for vision pro 2
4:18 i have a brain damage
am i the ony one who notices this dude posts his videos at 0.75 speed to stretch them out.when watch his videos at1.25 speed its obviously the speed its supposed to be.
You could've gifted it to me but no had to mess it all up 😢
Anti apple company 😂😂
🤦🤦💔💔😂
5:15 horrible moment :(
This has got to be one of the most painful videos I've ever watched! lol
I can’t watch this channel breaking things hurts my soul
Es muy fácil dañar un articulo que tardó años en ingeniarse y en fabricarse. Fabrique usted uno aver.
Good job. 2500€ is way to expensive for this
Mais quelle idée de détruire cette beauté 😢
He just scratched on my kidneys 🩸🩸🩸✍️✍️
New drinking game for ya'll.  Take a drink every time you notice a new injury on Jerry's hands as the tear-down progresses.
Finally you throw it to a Dustbin or garbage 🗑️
Great, now you can't use it and you will have to spend another 3500$
Who knew that trying to inflict damage on a product would result in damage to the product? I understand that you are testing the durability of the components, but it is unlikely that anyone would ever put such an expensive product in a situation where it could be damaged in the ways that you demonstrated.
Well done
I can't buy this thing and this guy is ripping it off 😅
😄🔥🔥
How rich is this guy?
RIP earphone uses 🙅‍♂🙅‍♂
I find it super disturbing that this dude is making money destroying expensive tech.
11:26
Как угандошить кучу бабла
What a heartbreaking sight
Apple is afraid of this man
PLEASE MY EYES ...
It's both interesting to see, and sad to watch
Vale mil veces mas el desarrollo de ingeniería y tecnológico que el mismo material, cualquier compañía quiere ahorrar en materiales. Por lo demás te hubieras gastado el dinero en gente que no tenia con que comer  💩
Max your VOLUME at 10:03! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOL at anyone who was stupid enough to pay real money for this garbage Apple product! Deep grooves at level 4 ROFL what a bad joke!!
you sound like ai
Sometimes I felt that he have some personal stuff to settle with apple company
Es una reverenda porquería
Vision Pro is not worth buying at all
Apple Vision No
"Computer for your face.". Soon computer will be implanted In our skull so no concerns of flammable head bands and scratch resistant glass.   Another product destroyed 😮
Apple fucked this up.
Very stupid review
are you seriously doing a scratch test on that??????????? I can't watch it.... this is a true horror movie
Bro destroyed vision pro in 13 minutes
"Love of a thousand grandmas" Holy crap, that is soft! Also the inside of that thing is pretty cool looking.
oh...
que mal ,cuantos quisieron tener un vison pro y lo destruye. XD
For the price they need to use better materials…
this shows it's not worth getting if you're clumsy with the vr
is that returnable tho i wanna know im curious (i am only 6 mins in so he might legit say it isnt or is)
Why I watch videos from this channel is to keep my childhood memories alive
Good to see Apple still using dogshit proprietary cables in their $4000 offering. This will make all the knobs want to rush out and buy this thing.

you hurting my soul. can u buy one
Vision Pro Literally started to cry at 10:03 😂😂
3500 dollars d pan kadd k rakh ti 😂
Cost for product: 200$ Price: 3500$  Why this greed, why the contempt of your customers, why the greed, why the theft of your customers who trusted you?
🙆🏾‍♂️🫣😢
просто уничтожил произведение инженерного восторга, столько сил и труда вложена в изделие, что бы просто как вандал разломать. у человека нету понятия ценности. мог и аккуратно разобрать.
Obvio es plástico ¿Qué quieres, tener un tanque en la cara?
Its about 400grands cost in India so seeing him destroying vision pro makes me uncomfortable 😅😅😅n sad too
Why to do it?
This was actually more entertaining to watch than a features review. Probably because most people have no intention of spending a fortune on hyped up tech.
truc asmr  et 90% du prix est pour son invention , l'ecran n'est pas transparent et n'a aucune option utile en extérieur
جييد👍
I mean…. Is it a cool concept? Yes…. But i mean…it looks so ridiculous 😂😂😂 Having it at home for like games, movies etc. is one thing, its like any other VR headset… But does Apple seriously think that people should walk around with these outside?! It looks like a couple of ski-goggles, with the exception of having to walk around with a battery pack on your belt 🤣🤣 and not only that, Apple wants you to pay $3500 to look like an idiot 😂
11:18 - "I feel like the Vision Pro is the first generation of something really special" - ugghhhhh, this line of thinking is what will inevitably lead the masses to give Apple the credit for kick-starting the modern VR industry. This is most certainly NOT the first generation and is in fact multiple generations down the line. Units like the Quest 2, Quest 1 are the true pioneers of this type of headset, and even they were based on the older and original Oculus Rift designs (which themselves still were not the first, but could be considered the first modern headsets).
why you doo thaaat !! give it to me if you dont need it 😳😳😳😳😳😳
Its better than a 5000$ LV fosho bruhhh
The fact that apple sells 3500 product AND ITS PLASTIC is insane
I am from bharat Please give me apple vision pro ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😮☠
Guilty of feeling like having a plastic laminate outer layer on glass is not a terrible idea because if the plastic should be scuffed you could just sand buff and polish it back to normal
Master of all youtuber
This video is a horror movie
Imagine if apple released a literal apple In a box
Su tono de voz me pone nervioso
The most distopic product I've seen!
Más accesible para discapacitados o para pobres... xD
Having trouble financially,having a bad day? Watch this guy and make your day worse😊
😢😢😢
WHY
Love your content keep it up bro!❤ Btw what watch do you use?
Dude at least you could give me rather than destroying it in the name of durability test
C'est quoi l'interet ? C'est pas un telephone on s'en fou de savoir si ça se raye non ?
Basically wait for cheaper brands.
okay so we want to know your opinion and you haven't given it to us, are they really worth $3500? What an incomplete video, it shows that you only do this for money, you don't give a damn about your 8.4m subscribers that's why you don't listen to them, you've left half the comments with doubts and you continue uploading videos as if nothing had happened.
Imagine he forgets to turn on recording
watching someone how to destroy 3.5k bucks is pretty comforting
solamente porque dijiste waldo en vez de wally voy darte dislike y promocion de que tu canal se dedica a la mentira y al advertising indirecto
এত দামি জিনিসটারে পোসমাডাম কইরা ছাইড়া দিলো😂
Концовка порадовала😂
Beautiful
noooooooo DO NOT DO THAT 😵‍💫😬
RIP vision pro
I took me 9 days to get courage to see $3500 get destroyed
Human can build anything ❤wow a tech

This video genuinely caused me physical pain
Ahora comprendo porque Mark hizo ese vídeo de Instagram quejandose de esto, y creo que tiene mucha razón diciendo que están pagando demasiado por algo que no lo vale y que los meta es lo mismo o incluso mejor.
Me watching him lighting up $3500 on fire: 👁️👄👁️
Sufrí demasiado viendo este, pero también lo disfruté bastante.
No you’ve taking it apart, now put it back together 😮
Do you know why I love your videos it's because you break expensive electronic gadgets like a piece of toy😂😂 Love your honest review..
Wow that’s so bad for £3500 and I scratches like that
For people without finger function, alot of life is rather unaccessible, so apple vision pro is very very low on their priority list.
I may get a ton of crap because of this, but honestly, Apple's Vision Pro built quality is absolute garbage. I'm not talking about the internals at all, since the hardware is an engineering marvel; but seeing the teardown definitely makes evidet that the thing could've had way less glue, and a way easier disassembling process, but didn't.
Poor Apple Vision Pro
no creo que ningún productos resista esas pruebas XD
That was weirdly therapeutic and insane at the same time.
DAMN can a mf get a warning before you go nail on chalkboard with the razorblade
Great review with spending over $3000 money!
Ummm can I have them even if you did all that to them please I would really appreciate it very much   I always wanted a vr  but I can’t afford one even with 2 jobs   My ps4 recently just gave up on me too so I have nothing to use I would absolutely appreciate it it so much 😢
You should do a tear down comparison of AirPods vs the usb type c EarPods from apple.
Bruh why did u waste it u could  have just given it to me 🥺
Imagine trending but don't know what a 100% plastic means ~ 😂😂😂
The flammability of that headband concerns me, I wonder if that is typical. Doesn't seem like it should sustain flame.  Might be comfortable, but it suck if it gave you really bad burns if something unfortunate should happen.
A 3,500 piece of cheap plastic
Porque está en español?
Plastic? Risitas' ghost enters the room...
uau...
Enjoy the sound at 10:03 🙉
後ろから火付けられたらやばい😅
For 3 grand, I'd expect sapphire crystal.
That do what I do like at the start sounded like a true sociopath about to dismember body.. using it for 2 hours was just toying with it 🤣
i cannot imagine the immeasurable amount of pain and horror that isheep would experience watching this.  i love it, keep up the good videos 👍
Wow
Meta Quest Pro >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
bro threw away some of the most expensive apple shit ever just to make us happy. truly a legend
bro roasted vision pro for 13 min and I loved it
Just waiting for techrax to drop this shit down a fight of stairs and submerge it in 10 gallons of cola.
Rip $3,500 also $800 for flimsy glass replacement
bro has  just trown away 3500 dollars
this mf was expecting 20 pounds of steel on his head instead of plastic
The most entertaining thing I've ever seen was this thing on fire... Tim Apple would not approve, but I'm here for it ! !
I laughed at *GRAND CANYON* level grooves
4:17  *ow*
peopel who make videos of how they destroy stuff is the laziest type of ''content'' out there besides reaction videos.
It really hurts
Skip 10;02 at all costs
Is it possible that you can ship me the RGB camera so I can perform some engineering study? I am ex-Apple engineer and working on MR product. I can take some high resolution image of the RGB camera and CMOS sensor, and share with you once I do some inspection. Appreciate!
I gotta take my headphones off every time you start scraping it 😂
imagine what would happen if the battery exploded
this thing is more expensive than my whole pc setup xDDD
is scratching the front glass only cosmatic damage?
OMG, layers after layers, Apple went 100%
I can't bought it in my whole life and you just destroyed it 😂
Bro is apples nightmare
agent 47
tremendo
RIP vision Pro 😞
this one was **actually** painful to watch
4:23 THAT MADE MY HEART STOP ..😬THAT SOUND😩HATS OFF FOR YU MAN FOR SUCH A STRONG HEART .
Broh you looks like agent47 legit
69 missed call from apple CEO 😂😂😂😂
these apple products are overrated trash
Pretty sure warranty is void on this one. Not sure though, might have to check GSX.
11:30 I'm not an Apple user, but I just watched a video about the UI/UX side of these and there actually are a few ways to interact with this out of the box.
im in pain!
feel so painful for the Pro but TY lol
Very nice beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
This thing is 3500$.. Apple is a disappointment.
Its very painful to put scratch on apple 😅
why would anyone buy this piece of crap for that price xD just get a quest 3 and have a bit less mind control with your fingers behind your back but at least they never pretended it to be something new
Jrig dont cruck my ribs 😅😂😂, stitched with the love of a thousand grand mas😂😂 killed me 💕
This guy is giving nightmares to apple
It is very educational and entertaining to watch you dissemble the Apple Vision Pro into its Metaverse and explain it in simple terms making me understand its pros and cons. Seems like we are in a generation of Rubiks Cube hype which will wash over until the next hyped thing comes along. I wounder when the first fake Apple Vision Pro goggles comes out made of skii goggles and some tape a cord and a white brick in the left back pocket for show off .... :)
This thing is the first apple product I'd actually like to have, very cool tech
i've been waiting for it😌
Будет царапаться даже об вакуум
И потом он понял, что видео не записалось😂
Watching you destroying expensive things just shatters my Heart cause I just can’t afford it I’ve been using iPhone 7 since 6years and it’s battery health is like 68%, can you please give me a brand new iPhone if you can 🥲
U destroyed it😢😢😢
❤
8:30 is that tape on your thumb? 😂
See how my dreams are falling apart in front of my eyes. I hope you will be more successful in your card every day, dear sir
Now send it back to apple for repair
this is painful to watch
This is PAIN
This is crazy...
😂 the Apple simps that have actually bought this thing 🤦‍♂️ rip
How much this can cost to make 15$ 20$, 50$ max ?
$3,500 !!! 😰😱 and just like that poof its destroyed 😅 Damn your are hardcore "Men"👍
I hurts me 😢 I'm poor but i need this I want this in my life as a surprise but i know it's impossible coz I'm orphanage boy
😢
At 5M+ views this video made him at least 20.000€ So destroying this device to show you what’s inside actually made him money
pelado hermoso
I, my entire life not buy  this vision pro.And here it is broken
Is there any way to disable audio tracks? It is automatically selected and I want to hear the original voice. I dislike the spanish voice that was used.
Plastic that causes cancer and health problems.  Not to forget that vr crap will destroy cultures and civilization
Did you think they would use glass? I mean, it's front heavy as is. Can you imagine the weight difference? God job making a pointless video. I love how say this thing is a popping $3500 just before you scratch it. Libs go figure...
APPLE 🍎 😂😂😂 MINI SCREEN ₹400000 🥵
clickbait title and thumbnail. ugh
Tears of loneliness 😂
wait until some chinese company release somthing like thi
bro i think you have some personal vengeance with apple 😂 i know while you holding the earphones
Hey there! Just a comment, it is in fact glass, but both sides of the apple vision pro goggles are laminated with a thin sheet of plastic, there is glass inside it.
Title should be   “Man vs. Apple Vision Pro”   or   “Man Destroying Apple Vision Pro”.
Viene con doblaje, que buen servicio 🫡
Finally, it gets taken apart and revealed!! Shame on apple with the extremely difficult "smash it" irrepairability.
Seriously i tried but i cant watch that !! It drive me insane 🥵😂
auriculares xd
I saw someone in the airport the other day with this on. I don't even know how to feel about it. It's worse than the iPad kids imo.
Jerry, hold your blade away from you bro. You are just one slip away from an uncomfortable teardown time 😄
I hope you can remove and buy glass lenses From 3rd party manufacturers
Единственное, на что это говно годится
People are increasingly staring at screens for long periods of time
Jerry, tell Rig to clean up the table ffs
@Ancapsu
hard to watch someone DESTROY a product that costs this much.  but then it's apple.
i get it, professional durability tester and all but be careful not to cut yourself when you're cutting toward your thumb 😬
Everytime I watch this man's videos I always want to cry a little
deberias de usar guantes de proteccion... solo digo.
anker be like : thanks jerry rig for not tearing down our products.... jerryrig: oh and by the way this video is not sponsored by anker.
8:48 bro is cutting the "laminated glass" like he is cutting an apple
What's crazy is a some point this will probably seems like super outdated and "primitive" technology to humans
1:18 probably some kids from china
Now you can sell ad real estate in any location. Simulated banner plane and you dont have to worry about billboard regulations because theyre digital
Don't buy it waste of money
4:16 I was not prepared for that noise
Apple love you for sure 😂😂😂
Love the OASIS reference
the first vision pro that go in the trash
Excelente Vídeo...
I hyperventilated all the way through this video!
min 3 -- it's still good, it's still good ....
Why was this so painful to watch?
a nice soothing voice, the kind you want to hear from a surgeon explain your heart transplant procedure just before he puts you under.  Excellent video, keep up the good work.
"Jerry the apple terminator "
This got to be most disgusting made vr headset not worth 3500 and its so cheaply made
This is vandal's heaven!
Yay, this guy understands that its Wh that what matters, not mAh, where Marques Brownlee (a "professional" tech reviewer with almost 20 million subs) was stumped and suspected there was "a lot of  heat insulation", lol.
Why is this 3500 dollars with only a 2 to 3 hour battery life
Watch out this dude is a hater
We want redmi note 13 pro plus
My 👂🏾😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Clean up your desk😁
If it was made with glass people would complain, that it cracks too fast and is heavy xD
Not Good Apple Vision Pro!  It's not good quality! when everything plastic is cheap because €3500 escapes! Apple is a lark! because you know next 7 years (used) there will be plastic damage
Why😢😢
You are the jhonny sins of technology 😂😂😂
hahahhahahha rippin 3500 hahha. very nice
Dbrand can make a glass protector for Apple Vision pro
He is mad😮
مين جاي من تيك توك 😅

If you have samsung note 9 display (second hand) plz give it to me🫠
Children in Africa won't starve to death because you ripped those goggles. Good job! You are saving Africa!  Or something like that.
If you didn't think apple could get worst
3500$ burnt to the ground 😂😂 I wonder how would apple respond to that
How is that possible, sir, you bought it and then destroyed it, instead of if it was properly tested, it means you can just sell it, but instead it was damaged, is it good to use again? Impossible.
Me da pena que ese producto lo quiero pero soy pobre. Me podria regular uno de esos ❤😮
In conclusion, overpriced product with bad quality materials that can't be repaired properly without busting your bank.
❤❤
If you don't want it you can give me it 😢😢
my heart 💔
This Hurst soooooo much😭
sheeps poop :D :D
Imagine being an electronic device ready to have fun with ur new owner but u realize
Ojala les hicieran a todos los vision pro este pequeño masaje
bro if u dont like it give it to me
Apple has to ditch lightning…. Apple: Hold my Vision Pro and M3 iMac😂
“Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas” is amazing 😂
Got a boo boo
gracias a ti descubrí que detesto este producto y que probablemente a apple no le cuesta ni 1000 dólares producirlo
Now go to apple repair and watch when they charge you 5x the amount of 1 apple vision pro.
mi stai facendo sentire male credimi
what do you do with all the parts left after the video, are you selling them to make back your money or just letting the views from youtube pay for the video. great video
Who cares about this trash product? A bunker update would be much more interesting !
Got Goosebumps While Watching this
Your content is excellent and useful. Thank you for your effort. But if there was dubbing for the Arabic language, it would be better
man this is.. oddly nice to watch
This came apart like some Ali Express shit! Damn that was rough to watch
You break my heary again bro..😢
My Ears from all that scratching
This is my favorite video on this product
Примерно тоже самое будет если упасть на улице в этих очках😂
This feels illegal
Here goes Annual salary of an IT fresher in India!
Respect for this guy using measure system instead of inch/foot system.
That sock is super flammable..!! The burn test has been legitimately useful. Beware, leaving it close to space heater.
I use the JerryRig Knife every day for work and they're extremely satisfying, and nicely weighted. in case you want to buy *something* after this vid.
Knitted by the love of 1000 grandmas hahaha <3
this is hurting fr
$3,500!? I thought it would be like $600.
I'll wait for gen3
tinny crator need support i love jerry videos
So they are kinda expensive sh*t....?
Tim cook's biggest nightmare 😅
nice ❤
😂😅😢
Hey Zac, here is an idea for you. We always look for the undides of devices, but we actually never looked into the brains. You probably already collected a bunch of different motherboards from phones and tablets. Try to disassemble a few of them by removing the metal plates on its surface. How does processor look like? Where is operational memory or SD memory located? Is the processor of Samsung phone or IPhone is bigger or smaller? Is there any visual difference between Snapdragon Gen 1 and Gen 3? And so on.  Try maybe even to cut the chip in half and put it under a microscope. Would we visually spot any difference in their architecture?  I think it might be interesting for us.
I just watched Jerry tortured me 😂😂😂😂😂
ouch hurt
However disgusted you are at the price. You can’t deny, this is definitely a masterpiece of engineering.
For every like this get, I'll do 0 pushups
😢😭he destroy APPLE VISION PRO 3500$
Nearly lag free is still a lot more lag than your eyes
Tears of loneliness 🤣
me esta doliendo hasta el alma ver como desmadras algo tan caro kbron
ur making me feel poor
11:25 😂
Watching a 3500US product getting demolished hurts my soul
أنا بتبعك من زمان وديه تقريباً أول مره أتعصب إنك بتكسر حاجه رغم إني شفتك بتدمر  iphone  و ipad pro وغيرهم حجات كتير
My heart crumbles when i see jerry rigging everything 🤯
I wonder how many times you have accidentally cut your fingers 😅
Apple in typical Apple fashion, being late to the market but also the best in the market. Even an Apple hater like this guy couldn’t find anything to shit on this time.
im not quite sure on the specs but the quest 2 and I believe quest 3 use usb c so I think this is just another Apple ploy so people have to buy their product
Bro just destroyed 3,500 dollars amazing
< la primera generacion de cualquier nuevo dispositivo siempre tiene carencias y fallas
this video caused immense pain to me lmao my therapist will be hearing about this
$3500 comes with plastic? not a glass?
Omg
excelente este video aunque creo que será en ingles que esta originalmente
Fucking hell, I have to watch this on mute lol
a nice soothing voice, the kind you want to hear from a surgeon explain your heart transplant procedure just before he puts you under.  Excellent video, keep up the good work.
Why not doing the TNT test or the Chainsaw Test? We can also throw it from a Skyscrapper with a 30 Kg weight on top of it while we are at it. Though this last one does not seem reasonable since might land over someone's head.
Apple needs to let the crypto community help & take this to another level with The Sandbox ,decentraland & all the Cryptocurrency metaverses.. this thing will be a hit specially paying people with crypto & NFT’S  Is Time for Apple To Admit Cryptocurrency is the FUTURE & Embrace it… this product is perfect for crypto and Blockchain technology…🗣️🦾💯💯💯💯💯
I am going to go hungry for months, I just watch $3500 equipment destroy..
dude, you are literally the ONLY one that has mentioned accessibility. I REALLY wish people would take more importance to that.
Hahaa
My question after seeing the inside and how it's built is what changes can they make so it will be lighter?
Well... let's just hope those cooling fans never get clogged up lol... especially since some folks are using these outside...
The price isn't visionary but the dissasembly is 🤣
4:58 Who knew that paper tissues contain knives?
Jelema ieu mah bisa na ngarusak hungkul
Hey man what happened to your finger?
This financially hurts to watch
Idk if they got much "love" in them, but they certainly were made by thousands of grandmas LOL
Ahh, hitman disassembles stuff, like it <3
Germany say hey 😂🧐
Thanks for 395 subscribers 🎉😊
make a video destroying the macbook m3 max 😅
Is it worth purchasing?
5:07 it looks like someone had really bad dandruff😂
I almost fainted multiple times on this video
can't watch it untill end :(
Where can I find the iPhone case he is wearing for his iPhone ?
I have severe ADHD, so I usually watch every YouTube video on double speed but you’re the only YouTuber that I will always watch on normal speed because your voice is so captivating
Back in the days your mom yells you for staying too close to the TV, its bad for the eyes. Now days, APPLE VISION PRO Baby!!!
LoL 🎉
Genre: Horror, Education
He is contributing to alot of electronic trash
At the beginning you said that it felt so real that you ducked under something that was fake. That's just inherent to VR. You don't have to buy a $3,500 headset to experience that
Always destroying things I can't afford 😢
You rig everything!, that is for sure.
How have I just found this channel? I wouldn't usually say this, but thank god for the Algorithm.
This angers me…I’d never do this to mine, but I guess you’re doing this so others don’t have to…
you made your point but eventually this item was not made to resist sharp tools that basically can hit and damage even stronger materials so what is this man and of course i am not fan of apple products

The love of 1000 grandma's <3 That was pure gold
Love the Ready Player One reference at the end. We're getting closer and closer to the oasis becoming a reality every day.
It was painful to watch the destruction of such an expensive device - not as painful as watching Marques Brownlee break the seal on a first-generation iPhone that he paid $40,000 for - but painful nonetheless. As usual, your content is exceptional. Keep up the excellent work!
Your scheduled text messages comment really hit a nerve, I don't hear enough people talk about this, but it's one of the main reasons I sent back to my iPhone and got a Galaxy.
💯
Not provide Wrists to tap u know why guys😅
You are hitting vision pro but I can feel the pain😢
I knew this video was coming.
Yes finaly cut it open😂
I have to think of ready player one every time somebody mentions the vision pro... That reference at the end made my day ngl
Why?
I can't buy in my hole  life time bro you simply destroyed that apple product is my life achievement to buy hole apple product's buy can't buy that product in my life bro 13:29  don't waste money bro ❤️
Maybe slightly off the topic, but this Vision Pro device is not a congruent device.  Strapping it to one's head...not recommended for good health.
11:40 There are accessibility settings that are similar to this! You can assign actions/gestures to sounds, so instead of tapping your fingers together you can make a “click” or “pop” noise with your mouth. You can also use your finger or wrist to aim the pointer rather than using your eyes, or you could have the pointer remain static at the center of your FOV and turn your head to aim it.
I'd buy it, but I won't buy it. Unless I became a big YouTuber and had the money for it.
I'm only here and also curious what's inside this tech.
I think your first margie night you unbox your wife like this😅😅😅
Awesome Review Ever...!!!!
🥲🥲💔💔
Imagine if he did this video using a second headset 😂
How do you sleep at night😂
everyone love seeing something so expensive get destroyed 😂
3500 bucks and it's made of plastic 😂 what a fucking joke
مراجعة جميلة 👏
11:42 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Di sini saya masih memakai android lolipop, di sana dia sudah membeli vision pro dan merusaknya, membuat dunia seakan tidak adil
Loved to watch it
3500 for googles!!!
this video just hurts me from the inside
Daily sheds blood for us
0:33 folks, thats the true Nightmare for me
Te van a coger los de Apple y te van a canear, jajajajajaja
More like knitted with a love of 1000 children
Poor little company apple, cant afford a normal glass
Can you donate it to me.. please 🙏🙏
Sheep will STILL buy it lol. Apple is a multi trillion dollar company building flagship models out of the cheapest "high end" materials they can get by with.
Best unboxing ever! Thx!
❤
Apple gak ada harga dirinya di bikin om jerry
The Question is can u use it as a welding mask
you'd think there would be a basic Apple Vision with that cheap plastic goggle lens and an actual Pro version with gorilla glass and some other nonsense material upgrade like titanium
10:03  My Teeth!
Srry this is dump to destroy stuff like this
vernier calliper is IP54, which is not waterproof, do notice it,
Perfect product created to spy on people's life now.
😂😂❤
😂😂😂😂
Plastic plastic and  lots of em
You are not supposed to take it out of the box! That hurts its resale value.
oh my good jerry😭😭😭😭
Now I can go to sleep peacefully. Thanks jerry.❤
Tears of loneliness, jerry seems to know the target audience of apple vision pro
That seems like a lot of thermal paste on both of those chips... One would think it's too much, seems like it would start insulating heat, rather than help get it away from them. Are they using some sort of special product that necessitates that amount?
Can you jerryrig yourself a new head of hair?
im dead ::::::::::::::::::::
Sir ji इंडिया में ये हमे कही मिल नही रहा है और आप इसका ऐसी के तेसी करने में लगे हुए है😂😂 I hope की apple india में भी vision Pro को जल्द ही launch करे❤❤❤
As a person living with SMA, I completely agree with the statement that there’s more features needed to accommodate accessibility
you scraping the aluminum part with the knife made me cringe so badly...
who else watching from vision pro?
Was painful to watch
Im here since 2017 😍 love you’re vids from philipines
3500 US$ for this scrap !
4000$ for this scrap !
Well, if it helps. This is probably going to be the worst Vision Pro Apple makes.
@A2D
Imagine the frustration of the guy who picks his garbage every day. 😂
U don't want give it to mee
Damn, this almost hurts me physically.
Watching this hurt me lol all the money wasted hurt my heart jeez
Holy shit....😮. Yo man if you have another vision pro give it to me...I'm not gonna "POSTMARTEM" of this
Imagine destroying a $3,500 VR set and at the end you forgot to press record. 😆
APPLE WILL BAN UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Plástico... lógico, no lo van a hacer de Titanio!.
Questi test mi sembrano davvero tanto ma tanto inutili
don't worry guys it still is in perfect condition
Truly satisfying experience of Apple Vision Pro
There is no universe where this thing needs to cost 3500
This guy is using the Vision Pro for what it is supossed to be made for and I love it.
Please Don't Do It😕😕
1.4 Million PKR in our country has been destroyed by jerry in this video.
Paper towel will destroy your plastic lenses! ... Yeah probably not but thanks for the hysteria ^^
I wonder if any apple engineers/designers watch this, I'd love to know what they think
Bro I need 2gb data recharge per day for study but I have no money and u are just scratch that expensive thing🥺
No way I jusr tried to blow out that fire💀
Looks like it is worthed at $350/- rather than $3500/-.........
Plastic lenses for 3500$? omg...
"tears of lonliness" I'm dying!
sufri viendo como lo destruia, pero era necesario jajaja
You're not just wasting money but you're wasting resources that we don't have enough of
7:35 lol no dude this is capitalism "repairability" is not only not an after thought they go OUT OF THEIR WAY to discourage and make it difficult, which is why we need to fight and have laws for it to do so.  If we were doing things for progress instead of profits we'd be much further along and it would be repairable to the average person, as well as customizable too. But nope, gotta have poverty and climate collapse because how else are lazy people gonna make money off the hard work of others?? 💀
imgn finding out you didn't press the record button 😅
thần kinh
😭😭😭😭
😅😅😅
55 juta buat beli plastik 😱😱😱😱😱😱
with this tool we will see more and more like crazy people on the streets in the future.
6:58 As is tradition with Apple and their anti-consumer bs.
4:25 what was that? Did Jerry say manufacturing n wh(g:eelchair
Rip Ltt😢
That's a pleasure to see how to destroy a vision pro ! :-D
Why do skretch this? you can donate us
If you didn’t come from the future raise your hand
I am sorry to tell you but if fire got that clost to the band around my head , my hair will catch fire before the fiber catch fire lmao , so I don't mind if it is like this , no sane human would get fire that close to him , but I agree with you , the front plastic seems too weak
I can't tolerate this
Wow
If u not want this then give it to me 😢
What if we start calling it the AVpro and you could just say. I have my AVpro’s on right now.
Scratch test on something you put on your eyes 😂 , it's not cell phone to do that test
iJustine is still around?! wat..
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
Jerry rigged 4000 dollar 🤦
Apple's decision to use the Lightning connector for its battery cable appears to be a strategic move to generate revenue from other companies through the production of adapters. This decision limits the compatibility of the cable with various external battery brands, potentially extending the lifespan of the cable. However, it is unlikely that Apple has implemented software restrictions to prevent the use of external batteries, as they have a history of engaging in such practices. Nevertheless, we should discourage such practices as they result in companies profiting from the production of adapters for the cable battery. Apple's reluctance to switch from the Lightning connector for an extended period can be attributed to this strategy. Alternatively, Anakef and other manufacturers may consider developing a battery with the same cable attachment as Apple, potentially capitalizing on this market opportunity. This would be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties, as Apple would continue to generate revenue from the sale of adapters, while manufacturers would be able to produce batteries that are compatible with Apple devices.
9:03 ㅋㅋㅋ
This artwork, while aesthetically pleasing, is not commensurate with its asking price of three thousand dollars. In my professional opinion, its value is comparable to that of a foldable Galaxy device.
😂😂❤
This is a touture test for us viewers
🖐🏻 Bro y did do this if u don’t need this just give it to me.
World is becoming modern
Oculus ? Lolol
Open box - excellent condition like new in box
imagine a vision with a clear shell.

I have a dream that people that cannot move their bodies but have working eyes can one day live in a virtual world and regain their freedom. Though I have neither the means, training, nor creativity to realize that dream.
*Completely sane human destroys $4000 and only monologues about his opinions* "my patience is immeasurable"
I don't want the vision pro. I want the headband strap. Looks comfy af to sleep
3,500 dólares por esa mierda
$3500 for typical apple hyped up garbage. Nice work
Think twice before publishing new products .apple 🍎  Jerry's knife is too sharp 😂😂😂 greatest Jerry🫡 👌 watching from 🇳🇵 🇳🇵
I don't see anything that justifies 3500 dolllars
Jeez scratched that easily
Why do we have to waste so much ?!
8:48 Le mejor frase hasta el momento.... y por favor, ponte guantes 😨
rip 3.5k
the Top most way to waste Money... would have been a great title
I must admit that I really enjoy watching you break it
Bro has the perfect head for this
Tears of loneliness 💀💀

500 dollars for a hunk of plastic and a iphone, *Weak move, apple.*
Imagine if you came home to find your Vpro in such a state. Left in your room when siblings were around.
😭
8:08 ✌
Holy shit bro i clicked on your video for the first time and your voice surprised me amazing voice.
“Leave the software review for iJustine”  lol who in their right mind listens to her for actual informative reviews? Her content is useless.
"I would recommend against standing near a campfire while wearing the vision pro" don't worry, people who are gonna buy this don't really go outside all that much
😔 🤦‍♂️
That really hurt. Mostly because you know he is completely wasting a lot of money.
This video got him more than he paid for them
Imagine expecting quality from Apple lmao
Gracias por hacer este canal en Español, amamos tu contenido!
Tip para el doblaje en español habla mas normal te ves hablando forzado
why havent they made a cover that only reveals the cameras so you can see without exposing the screen?
Waiting for that & finally
Eda maha pabhi😵‍💫
whay man you destroy it whay you f*** my life
what a waste of money
What the frog is wrong with u
There goes $4K
Wouldve been nice if you dropped tested it, from various heights..submerged in water....then err, "deconstructed" it. still, very neat video!
It can be disappointing not being able to buy this product right now since I live in Turkey, but still, it was fun to see it being taken apart. Watching your video was enjoyable and nice, good job! Maybe one day I'll have the chance to try this product, but I won't be able to take it apart like you did. Have a good funny days.
The audio is crap for a high end device. Beaten by valve index.
bro you are insane
hammasiga kulb qoydm
Love to see American people that use Android and not stupid IPhones or other Apple stuff. By the way, i love how u show us this plastic thing get destroyed.
😦😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 it hurts
TOO MUCH LITE in eyes = BLINDNESS so 50 hrs not taking that VR off is not good. Good Info: Copper Blocks WIFI -- USLOBBYISTLIED WORLD KNOWS; Rollens/SideWindowDeflectors/lowbluelightsVINYLORANGE; Eyejusters; GrissomBARON; ZPG1.5c; EARMUFFS. Dentists don't track X-Rays don't get MRIs
I have a question. Why would anyone buy this? And now for my unasked and unwanted review: I am an apple consumer and have been for a long time. But I was able to try it out thanks to a friend. And it was what I expected. It was completely unnecessary. I’m getting a quest 3 instead. Plus, the vision pro doesn’t have a lot of apps and most features are flashy over functional. Also the vision pro managed to bend my glasses 👍.
I'm an androind user and this hurts to watch.
This hurts to watch
Take the R1 chip and put it in a Mac book and make it work
Dio mío!... Qué doloroso fue para mi ver este vídeo...😖
$3500 for plastic is absolutely, positively, incredibly wacky
Apple fanboy really come here only because it's "HuRr destroying expensive boogalo" not knowing anything

"most cuddliest"? What are you, 3?
Its plastic WHAT????
Bro spent all my life savings on a machine just to destroy it
Jerry sir I need your expertise I have a toolbox and I had a wheelchair I married the two of them anyways now the toolbox is a wheelchair /toolbox I was on it down the street from my house the manager came up to me and said I cannot be doing that because it is a recreational vehicle but I was using it as a wheelchair I've been very sick and on top of that I have knee problems can they discriminate against my wheelchair / toolbox I was using it as a wheelchair any advice would be greatly appreciated
$3500 is ridiculous this is going to be nothing who has that kind of money to spend on VR glasses? Ultimately, Apple notes that VR does not sell because of the price stops updating and people are left with worthless glasses that they can no longer do anything with
It's psychological comfort when I watch the video, don't buy it about religion😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
La verdad se nota muy delicado prefiero un Mac
Tears of loneliness got me bad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bro just ruined almost 400k currency in our country 🇧🇩

How badly damaged your brain need to be to buy this product ?
RIP Vision Pro
😃
Kind people, please help as much as you can. I really want to eat 2200700594165622 Tinkoff
✋
If you don’t want, can you give it to me?
While impractical as hell, I think even the late Steve Jobs would appreciate the look and operation of this thing
i bet it hurts us more than these glasses
Hey Zac, i heard that Xiaomi 14 Pro is using  Xiaomi own screen glass that claims to be 10 times tougher than Gorilla Glass Victus🤔 are you going to do the durability test on xiaomi 14 pro?
Thanks I didn’t know that Apple vision breakable
Your accessibility ideas are really great. I’m thinking choices (very unlike Apple) would be best for the high cervical injuries. Blinking twice? Excellent start! Blowing and sipping may be possible with facial tracking, jaw movement etc. This could be HUGE for the SCI community. Very hopeful! -a PT going into SCI soon
trade back in saying it broke :D
Yea I'm waiting till the 2nd version come out...3,500 device shouldn't break so.damn easily
You should give it to me instead destroying it
When you take the plastic laminate off and the first layer of plastic it looks like something straight out of a PFS like titanfall, cod or destiny and looks sick.  Selling custom skins for these would be awesome to get it to always look like that. 10:02
09:01 One Piece
he destroyed the headset even before unpacking the power bank
Imagine you ware the vision pro whole day that pisses your mum. Ended your mum rip off your vision pro just like what he did
I don’t understand why I should pay $3000. In apple vision🫠
11:30 upcoming cyberpunk game trailer 🤣
video title - "be gentle with apple vison pro"  _  everything going on in video - "very brutal"
😂😂😂😂
the plastic protects its self from your " Tears of Loneliness " That killed me :D
Plastic is plastic and plastic scratches.
The most painful JerryRigEverything video I have ever not finished. And I finish all of them.

BHAIYA TUMNE MC DIYA I PHONE KI

3500$ Material Cost? Never,....  300$ Materials.... oof
In reality he is Bas Rutten destroying tech like he wanted to destroy his opponents in MMA
This doesn't make any sense to destroy
100% genuine test all video thanks jerryRig
Satisfying. In your face, Apple.
Jerry: *buys 2M$ Bugatti Chiron* Jerry: Be gentle throwing Bugatti Chiron off a cliff
😮😮😮😢
Cheap materials, expensive as hell. Yeah, this is Apple, alright? What are the chances of me buying this? ZERO. 😂😂😂
It’s great to have MKBHD conduct software testing, while having you being a hardware tester hahah 😂. Both are legends!
What is the use of destroying Vision Pro ? I don’t understand 😵‍💫 aha yes .. throw 3500 dollars in the trash 🤨
Presence of thermapaste means that it should be changed at least once per year.... but according to video disassembling of thus thing is quite a challenge
this is destroying me, how can u do this
You wasted 3499$
Nice teardown🗿
JERRY RIG EVERYTHING ❎️                   JERRY DESTROY EVERYTHING✅️
فلوسسسسسسسسس😢😢😢😢
Things we can't afford to buy and this guy doing testing torsion 😅
13:25 🙈😂😂😂
Love this man videos, always showing the Quality of everything
*new apple product releases*  also every tech youtuber instantly torturing the thing:
Let's go
The best teardown ever
The pain starts at 2:10 🫢
5:48 "Tears of loneliness" Jerry knows me too well
Can you do the Galaxy a15 5g please just got it and want to know how much pain it can take
Tak sepadan dengan harga yang ditawarkan $3500.
Hats off to do like this test.
Im watching this video while using the apple vision pro 😂
Apple Knew you would bend it so they had to reinforce it this time 🤭
Thank for Vision Pro ki maa behan krne ke liye
may be he got free
😂😂Thanks , you  made my day👏
Bro just smoked 300k rupees
My man has warranty 😂
8:43
Bro @6:11 my jaws are completely broken 😮
💀_focus
I stopped playing video games around the time when they became 3D. That was a long time ago. We are in 2024 and I still find the quality of the 3D stuff pretty much mediocre. Go figure.
WoW
have you attempted a teardown and rebuild ever?
so what im seeing is less than $15 in materials from their cost.
Am I the only one who thinks Jerry runs the HowtoBasic channel as well?
have you made your money back from this one yet how many views snd such do you need to break even on this one?!
wheres waldo!!!! bahahahaha im dying my guy! thumbs up for that 🤣😂
Scraping that aluminum without warning gave me goosebumps like nails on a chalkboard
Why do you destroy apple vr I don't have money to buy it and you are destroying apple vr 😢 please give it me sir I love apple vr please don't destroy 🥺
Why I love all the vandalism done by this guy 😂❤
What about the battery pack 😅 I'm curious why it's that big for a 3,000 mAh.
I felt that 10:11
4k gone like that
I heard you say the rubber might help to keep out “water, sweat or tears of loneliness out of the vision pro” 😅😅😅😅
Thank for tearing that up so we dont have to. It's pretty solid I must say.
Apple is fooling everyone
This felt illegal to watch
Un poco de Kola Loka y queda joya
great review for not-valuable stuff
ngl it is exciting.  Apple being the leader I am not so sure about, but I am glad someone did it, hopefully we will see other companies put in the money!
This dude found a way to make a living off of destroying expensive toys. A visionary bully’s dream.
Me dio un repelús en todo el cuerpo y casi me caigo de la silla al escuchar el sonido que hiso cuando rayo la pantalla holográfica en el 10:02
Bro if you don't want this product give me but don't do that this 😢😂
Brother, if you have so much money then give me some too, what will happen if you break it like this?
Apple only fear of JerryRigEverything
dang, thats one overpriced piece of plastic
you rigged it well..
Why
Hey Jerry can I get a phone
When you gonna add drop test on your every rig video ?
I wouldn't pay $350, let alone $3500 for that shit
Tejida con el amor de mil abuelas jajaja
No required thank you...its not necessity its luxury...
I feel so sad about that Jerry destroys things that I will never be able to buy ☹️
DONT CLICK PLZ 4:16
3500$ !
설마했는데 ㅋㅋ
Make a MACBOOK AIR  M2 15 inch Display Scratch Test 😀
9:35 “but don’t worry, my patience is immeasurable” That sounds like some kind of mustache twirling cliche villain line😂
The Quest 3 has USB C and it's fine. How are people still so naive about Apple's business practices?
Apple deffo dont give a shit about enviroment with their non fixable products
It’s nice but I am not playing no $3499 for that
iPhone does have scheduled text messages. You’d have to configure it in Shortcuts, but it does exist. There is a plethora of apps that are made for writing scripts which you can launch with a shortcut and you can do incredible things. One I use a lot is when I switch to my work focus mode, it opens all the relevant apps in the background and completes tasks without having those apps open, it really streamlines everything. So I can understand why it would be great to have scheduled texts without the need to make a shortcut, but it’s literally so easy to make
That outro tho 😂😂
Ok but is it worth $3000?
I have to like and comment since this is pricey video
A garantia cobre isso ?
So stupid that you pay for apple care. But still have to pay more when you need it.  It's kinda like health insurance lol
By this time  Samsung, Huawei, Mi would have started ripping the Apple vision pro to make their copied versions 😂
It's $3.5k!!???? WHAT!? that's crazy 😮
Painful to watch 😵‍💫😳🥹
Amazingly destructive, I love it
I wouldn't pay $35.00 for this.
i dont even like apple product but seeing that destruction makes me sad...
BRO THAT HURTS, I CANT AFFORD A IPHONE AND HIM BUYING AND DESTROYING IT. at least its a good content
um teste  sem nenhuma utilidade apenas uma destruição bizarra
no offense, but this thing looks like it will give anyone eye cancer
3500 for some apple garbage
I wish that I could buy one of those headsets
Wow this Scam Vision Pro is so beautiful 😅
I just wish I could be Zack’s friend. I need a friend that inspires me like this guy. I know that can’t happen but I’m happy just to watch his videos. Thanks for the info on the vision.  Thanks for getting my mind off all the bs in my life
“To the likes of ijustine, mkbhd…” Perfectly described their intelligence level. 0:30
Wow
😢😢
apple is mad after this the M chip is $400 the rest 300
As someone who just found out this thing costs like 3500 dollars and not like 500 dollars as I originally thought, I am panicking at this destruction
I'll give it to Apple with this one. This is an awesome piece of tech
Man go destroy some Chinese copies just give these to me😕
Todo un malandro rompiendo eso 😅😂
Just get Nintendo Virtual Boy
3000 dollars basically has plastic screen.
think I just found the whislindiesel of technology
bro can buy more vision pro after getting the add revenue
What a teardown!
gracias jonnhy sins por darnos esta magnifica experiencia de desensamblado de las vision pro
6:56 looks like Darth Vader putting on his mask for the first time in episode III
10:03 I HATE THAT SOUND SO MUCH!!!! Those school daily planners that had that texture on the front sucked SO MUCH! The vibrations that I felt in my fingertips when I drug my fingernails on it I still remember everytime I hear or think about it.
distroy stuff sucks. dislike
Todo echo con material resiclado y aun asi te cobran un monton de plata Por ellos
Why you destroying you should just give it to me bro i need that😢🥴🥴
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
great video as always Jerry
donne au lieux de casser la stp
Jerry's most famous line "knowing that eventually the time would come, to uh, you know, do what I do" lol😂.  RIP, Apple Vision Pro😢.
Sencillamente HERMOSO ! 👍🏻
I'm still trying to understand the meaning of this useless video...
Any1 else noticed the reference on the Oasis at the end of the clip  from the movie Ready player one ? Wp 😉
JRE's ebay: Vision Pro for sale, slightly used
this hurt to watch knowing how expensive it is....
Please quit singing your sentences.
Love the content. But man is it hard to watch seeing such nice products being destroyed at times lol.
$4000 for bit of plastic and some wires😂😂😂😂
I HATED 10:10. My god, I cringed so hard
😢
Meta Quest 7 :
This hurt to watch; It was a great video, and I hate apple but the thought of 3500 being destroyed hurts me in my poor man pockets LOL
what next? durability test on an. OLED TV by dropping it? lolz
Did I miss the screen burn test on this device?
:D
the scratching sounds r painful
Ааа сердце аааааа
I was born in 1984 and will be turning 40 in august this year. I've been dealing and tampering with videogames, pc's, laptops, mobile phones, electronic gadgets and whatnot since as far as I can remember. Still, I have never ever had any motivation or reason to use an apple, macintosh or whatever product this brand put out. Best thing I remember trying out from them were the iPods, which sounded awesome, had long-duration batteries and also connected perfectly to some old car stereos in my old time. Apart from that, I have always found their product to be extremely overpriced, difficult and very expensive to repair, and did also easily become obsolete. I am no hater, I just never knew how people got so fond of Apple products.
damn didn't realise these things are actively cooled
4:18, my soul left my body
I have been watching your videos for years in English despite not speaking English. I appreciate that you translate the videos into other languages ​​and the dubbing done in Spanish greatly improves.
lol the carnage
I definitely want one but not for $3500… definitely gonna wait for a few models
Apple care for $500 or $4000 before taxes. What a piece of junk. Assuming that the people buying this have an income of at least $70k making this a 5% discretionary purchase, it blows my mind that Apple would 1 charge so much for this and 2 make it so poorly, especially when they lecture nonstop about their commitment to the environment.
Ngl 8 year old me used to be so mad when bro broke apple products I used to be like bro could’ve gave that to me 😂
That is awesome, i thought the lens was transparent.. serious question for the smart folks, will one of these units work to protect your eyes from working with powerful lasers?
Still couldn't find where the $3600 went
bump
Rushing to the bin asap😂
Please Indian video language video Hindi dubbed
Please Hindi language video
Lol, how to  destroy 3500 dollars in just 13 minutes.  😅 😂
Please Hindi video
Us WHY YOU RUINING A 3.4 K VISON PRO   Jerry: for content for you
this shit is way too overprized
Bro just destroyed something worth 2 month of my salary in a 13 min video
Every time the same story with Apple. In advertisement it looks great. After You buy, its a peace of cheap plastic.
it hurts
Ojalá cambien el material porque parece de rehabilitación
ngl this video makes me mad af
I did see a video where some guy did drop tests, cracked that front piece then just pealed it off and everything still worked fine.
Wow that’s sad that Apple put plastic or “laminated glass” on a future product edit: it hurts hearing that scratch
not to be that guy ( he does what ever he wants with his money ) but seeing him destroying stuff like that while he could just give it to somebody is kinda weird to me but i'm not gonna tell anybody what to do with their money
3500 for this ??😂😂😂😂😂 📈📉📊
I can never finish watching these videos
The amount of hardware that Apple packed in the Vision Pro is crazyyyyy
So we learned one thing if you attack it with a box cutter you might scratch it
For sale on e bay next week -mint condition , brand new, rarely used with the original box and all accessories 😂😂😂😂
Watching this video voids the warranty on my Vision Pro. Yep, just like that. So, watch out! 👀🚫
no puedo ver!
2030 " You own nothing but you will have your apple vision pro on".

Thats what 3500$ gets you these days lol
tears of loneliness 😂😂
My bro reviewed the apple vision pro like a KFC fried chicken 🍗 🐔 💀
Imagine paying $3500 for this only to realize afterward that the glass has plastic over it, so it literally doesn’t even matter that it’s glass
My anxiety level while watching this video : 📈📈📈
😮😮😅
you still owe Phone Repair Guru a bar of silver
Please make one video apple CPU What's inside in
Bored Breaking Apple Vision Pro
satisfaction🤑
This dude single handedly lowering apple stock on each new product they put out.
jerryRigEverything is always be jerryRigEverything.... i like this up 🤣
did he attempt to put it back together or do you think he just chucked it in the trash can
Its made to break. What a waste.
🥲3500$
Watching in Android i don't apple phone but still watching this because Jerry destroyed this
HOW do people still buy from Apple!? I just don't understand
3499$ burned infront of everyone
Stupid test
definitely one of most enjoyable teardowns I've seen
Shoul've been Saphire, glass, plastic
When you finish please parcel the rest to me  🙏🙏 please😢😢
7:04 I was shocked when I saw these two fans it is fully blocked, it is not transparent, means we are looking at a virtual picture from it, in actually there is no visible glass on it. OMG
How our eyes are visible when it's have the fans inside the glass. WTF
I have watched a lot of videos of jeryy feeling nothing but watching this video just hurts like hell.
@Premsbt
Who came here only for reading comments like
Expose
I am not an Apple fan but this was nice technology wrapped with poor material. It deserved much better :(
😅😂 Moking apple in the end for unfixable repairs😂😂😂😂
Tech JCB
Finally jerriy fucked apple vision pro😂
All I wanted to do was clean the Fan! (Song)
Someone is stealing your content I saw it on a different channel just letting you know
brother trust me nobody is gonna use this product as roughly as you so it is good though 😂
Bro if you have more money then so please gives to me...
Any one that gets fooled into one of those, is just that .  Just a fool.
11:33 goofy 😂
Seeing jerry rigging apple products, feels like he was fired from apple once😅
Wow, that krich krich sound in this video is absolutely crazy, and it sounds like there's something big happening, even thousands of dollars involved.
how is the crasy is do the fire on 3500 dollars
Not 100 grandmas 10 11 year olds, even better
I am everywhere
Take out those fans, chipset, motherboard and put them into iphone, so you reduce the bulkiness by 40% and mb 30% cheaper
$3500 for plastic lenses... Yikes
Apple Vision pro = bunch of camera + bunch of sensors
You had me at "tears of loneliness." LOL
8:07 nice  ✌🏻 addition 😅
11:33 bro I feel bad for you 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
10:06 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 why bro why 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
How can you be so cruel...?!))
So it's not transparent.
Really not a fan of Apple, like Zack/Jerry, but I gotta say... the Apple Vision Pro is really impressive and would like to try it out. But like the tech also the price is impressive...
Estás loco…….
bro needs to wear cut resistant gloves
In 2026 ever thing is gonna be Jerry rig proof
Swear it brings nothing new to the market. Index, Oculus, Vive pro have been out for awhile. All this apple thing is just a proprietary VR headset that fails at gaming because locked to Apple OS. Plus fact for its price point it should come with controllers. Every other headset does. Lets be honest people mostly only buy these for gaming.
I'm sorry, what? How is that battery pack considered small? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please Please review the samsung galaxy A54 or the A34, they are great phones and I wonder how the durability test will do😄😄
Expensive piece of cheap garbage.
Pure pain
Why?
holy, this dude looks like agent 47
That is if money is no longer valuable in front of him, even tens of dollars are like being thrown away and that's not even a small amount of money, $3400 is worthless.
This actually made me respect apple’s design so much more. There’s so much at play
Hello, I just wanted to tell you that your video has been downloaded and posted to tiktok in China by people from the mainland. Hopefully, you can add some text to prove yourself in the video. Thanks, I hope you can see that.❤
Its almost normally unbreakable
You should make a movie about yourself, and name it "Balls of Steel".
sir please give me this rest of stuff so I can create my own vision headset
I needed to see you throw it in the trash bin at the end
Can i have it
Thanks for sharing Jerry
To destroy equipment worth hundreds, thousands of dollars... and wear a 20 dollar watch, that means not to be affected by fame, and to remain modest :)
Seems like this won't work again
I love that the first thig he shows us is a graveyard of all the phones he destroyed
We all know what people are going to look up with this.
Watching this video is torture 😭😭😭
bro made mad money destroying that lol
dios nunca un video me habia dolido, experiencia nueva ...
I feel like this is such a waste of recources
What if they will explode in front of your eyes 👀?
This was so satisfying to watch
😮
That outro😂13:19
The only thing that is never destroyed in his videos are the boxes
You can turn it off by pressing the crown and shutter button and after 5 seconds u will see slide to power off

Most painful video 😢😢
You should wear safty hand gloves while testing bro
the amount of times you touched the lenses/cameras mentally scarred me
You are looking like Jhonny sin
>nah i dont cut myself. don't worry! >THUMB GASH
Barely a scratch, you can still use them after gluing all the parts to themselves.
somehow this video is hurt my kidney, ugh!!
Just omg😮
😂😂😂😂
i want to say apple product is premium but it takes too many generations and money to be perfect. just take iphone as example
This is SO PAINFULL to watch. I AM LOVING IT!!
Apple makes garbage and lies to customers. Schocking...
He could still sell this to a fanboy for $2500.
does it still work
PLEASE Tell me there will be a teardown Skin of the Vision pro that you can put on Other vr Headsets
Apple fanboys coming out with ... Oh Oh but that's why you always put it in a cover.... :P
Me: Bruh why you could've had some new apple vision pros.    Apple: 💀
3.500€ for a piece of plastic?
How are you Jerry? I noticed 4:44 that you have a cut on your finger 😢 bro take care! Love your work.
я бы такие тесты в перчатках проводилбы руки не жалко разве? смотря на твой канал ну ябы в спецовке хотябы был
r u that prn guy?
To all the repairmen out there Jerry just did a big favour, now you know how not to disassemble Apple vision pro.
you threw it away?
Steve joff crying in the cornor after watching ur videos
Was Even the point is There anything in the whole world that doesnt get scratched? Do You really need a test that tells You thats Guess what ? Increíble expensive and delicate technology that comes in form of glasses !!!! Doesnt cope well with scratching it with a razor
In our country this is 50 million you fuck it
That’s the first Apple product I don’t be buying.
Man give it to me and don't destroy it please 😭😭😭😭
You just wrecked $3500. Hats off to your dedication.❤
Bro I’m never watching this again bro I almost threw my phone across the room 💀
Bro destroyed our dreams
worth it technology and the good thing i like about is m2 chip
Хах.)) Я выпал))
It's always amazing to see your videos mate. The child inside us starts jumping in excitement to know what's inside, without having to wait for constructive dismantle!

Watched 2 ads to suuport you for this video. Thanks jerry
"tears of loneliness"
“Tears of loneliness”😭
Bas itna ameer bnna h Rich like him
I’ve seen lots of people see this video and say it’s plastic not glass. It’s glass with plastic over the glass on both sides.
Cringes during the entire thing (in a good way)
Actually many other big companies are working on this thing. This is the future.
Is it still working?
This was calming to watch knowing someone at Apple is probably loosing their shit at this vid 😂
😢 my eyes
This sure is a piece of art but $3,500 I think is madness. Probably costs like $500 to produce them.
I can't watch.... :( .....
bjirr😭😭😭😭
Don’t worry, the Apple zombies will gladly get a loan to buy something they don’t need. Apple can always count on them.
czn i have mobile i have 8 years old mobile
i was sitting and waiting to be tired but than i saw this cryed for a while and then watched it twice
It's sad when you destroy something that cost more than   $3000
i dont get why people always cut towards themselves like 8:54
man i feel those who just first time seeing this channel and the amount of destruction on expensive equipments

Grand canyon-like grooves at level 7 😅
Bro eats apple vision pro in lunch
Can u tear apart of Lamborghini or Ferrari and do scratches testing on it ?
10:00 vision pro screaming of pain  😂
It pains me to watch this😢
11:32 people without finger?😐
scratch test with Cybertruck glass and stainless steel?  Level 9?
I reported for public harassment😂😂😂
Vision pro🤢👎👎👎👎
Watching a man destroy something that cost more than one month paycheque is giving me anxieties!
like ur casio watch
Don’t waste this. Please send me my location
Now take it back to the Apple Store and say: it’s not working
Getting scammed by apple again!!
This time apple give hard time to Jerry to teardown.. after a long year we see some revolution
11:35 That's whats annoying about using the quest with no controllers. Since I am missing my middle finger, I can't use the palm gestures because it thinks my middle finger is bent.
Me personally I could never
Seeing anything Apple destroyed always brings a smile to my face. Seeing Apple fanbois going mental over it gives me a half chubby 😂
This is painful....😢
Plottwist: it still works
Please tell ANKER to launch POWERBANKS to launch in CANADA fast Ive been waiting for it since 4 months now 😢 qi2 black 10k powerbank
12:26 me if i got one(drops)
Android haters that say “android is for broke people🤓” have been quiet ever since this video came out.
"tears of loneliness" that was cold.
A2d
I think this channel has issues.  Why destroy expensive items.  You could give them away instead of getting clicks.
in the beginning of the video it hurt but then i just excepted it 😂
The vr is impressive
Bro fu*ks the apple vision pro
I was waiting for this
here i can’t affort and there they are distroying it😢
I don't know why I feel scratches on my heart😢
The most sophisticated piece of tech I've ever seen... 😅
Satisfying 😊😊😊😊
Bro destroyed others dream😂
Apple didn't thought that Vision Pro be in Jerry's hands even before anyone gets to buy it first
How this Apple Vision Pro could be mine hurts my soul so much
waiting for A2D review soldiers assemble
My heart 💔
You got too much money for me … lmao
I watched whole video bitting my nails with teeth 😬😬😬🫣🫣🫣
What is the purpose of the glass in front😂
Hell yeah ❤❤
Apple still out here making overpriced products made of cheap materials that people just eat up for some reason  Good to see that some things never change.
Apple is always stagnant in their existing markets. They make good products, but there's little to no innovation. But every time they decide to tap into a new market and design a new product, they approach it from the ground up and create something incredible. That's where Apple's innovation really shines.
woh
Damn vision pro really got obliterated
😅 I’m agree, is no way how I’ll gonna buy this thing. 😅
Solo es estafa y control mundial
I wonder what they'd say if you brought that thing to an Apple store and asked them to fix it.
the apple vision pro is made of metal not plastic
The Samsung XR headset better have Gorrilla glass armor.
brother i hate you for destroying expensive suff... indirectly you call us poor 😅
I have been saying in my head all day ( it was knitted by a thousand grandmas)
im so happy apple decided to permanently tank their brand and become a lolcow
😢😢
*_WHO pays for this ridiculous website?_*
*AND a proprietary battery that (when new) only lasts two hours? You need at least one more $200 battery just to watch a movie. THAT’S CORPORATE GREED AT IT’S WORST!!!*
Spanish audio for this video sucks. I preffer the original audio.
Tears of loneliness 😂
Until that shit is eye glass size ain’t no one who ain’t spent they whole childhood on an iPod wearing that outside 😂😂
"there's no way a USB-C... ...cable would have been able to handle a moving user like this thing is able to."  My Quest 2 I use with a USB-C link cable all the time: Am I a joke to you?
800 $ glass....broke by a 15 $ knife...apple in a nutshell
welcome to conditioning
funny and strange that I am enjoying this like a  comedy show
Great videos like all video you made but same time painful for people like me can’t afford to buy even the oculus 😂😂😂😂
People that are going to buy this : 🐑
I just need the knitted comfort made by a thousand grandma.
I love I Matthew
I really wish you would mute the scratching bit 😂. Love the vids though!
We are waiting for Apple to release its electric car. And this guy will destroy him.
expected glass for a 3.500 dollar gadget. at least the inner lenses
As soon as you lit that strap on fire i blew on my phone to put it out 😂
man i wanna be rich like u to destroy a $3500us tech
a decent apple product no way
SON OF A BBBBBBBBB!!!! Is what i yelled when you scratched the metal with the knife
والله ياهو فصخها تفصيخ 😂😂
I just want to see him destroy the Apple Vision Pro
I think no one in real life going yo use a sharp razor on any device. So this guys review is useless . Better do a useful real life reviews
More junk not worth 20.00
Thanks for the warning. Was set to watch this video, then saw that this here video was posted on tiktok. Thanks for saving my time before i got through the first ad. I will not be viewing this video!
Man trashed half my monthly salary right infront of my eyes 😅
stpt
your videos are well made but i hate them so much i can't take it how do you manage to stay calm while you destroy expensive stuff ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Can anyone say why the hardness levels are designed as they are with those numbers along the curved viewing area?
Id never get one i can't justify $4k but it still hurts to see it destroyed. But I'm all for science
This guy is the whistlindiesel of tech
"not designed to be repaired" gotta love  tech that's hostile towards its user base, but its apple what else  would you expect.
3500 for trash no way
The love of a thousand grandmas 😂😂😂😂
13:24 😂😂😂😂 you are crazy men 😂😂😂😂
These videos are like ASMR for tech nerds
As a VR user, him scratching the lenses made me physically retch
So what’s the purpose of this I’m not getting quest vibes just getting a virtual tv vibe with no controllers lol
Well, of course it scratches at level 3, how else would they make it so affordable
Apple Vision Pro tear down skin when?
accessability is important, and so is repairability, or compadibility across platforms
this is the best thing i ever see in my life
👌🤍
This is a great video
El traductor al español jajajaa
Can you even use this if you have astigmatism?
Probably the most proffesional youtube channel ive seen tbh
Holy shit that hardware is insane
Im excited for a different company to replicate this, but only charge 1500 because they left out the apple logo.  And i know its apple, but come on! The lengths they went to in order to prevent repairs is so absurd
Glad I watched this before I lit mine on fire
Tears of loneliness ☠️
Me blowing at the screen trying to put out the fire
Watched this on my Vision Pro and it gave this video a thumbs down on its own lol
why did he do this
WhistlinJerry
It's crazy that they didn't put gorilla glass on the front eye shield.
Watching him destroy stuff u can’t buy at 3am keeps me sane
what that one girl did with my heart:
Cuánta plata para un video aunque da pena pobre apple esta bien que es una prueba pero es triste 😢
Every time I heard the scratching, I felt a surge of bloodlust I've never felt before.
Tú necesitas recobrar la sensatez. Estas gafas son carísimos. No pienso comprarlas puesto que no me quedaría dinero para juguetes de este estilo. Solo compro cervezas.
8:06 you can schedule text messages with the shortcuts app. It isn’t as nice as it should be with the messages app though.
okay can i have your apple vision goggles plez :) thats if you think of putting it in the trash ofcourse
que animal ,se que es su trabajo pero es un pecado esa destruccion ,porque no compra unas cuantas y las regala con los millones de view se coje en cada video como por ejemplo este
Knowing I’ll probably never own this- then watching someone so casually just absolutely obliterate it is true pain
This was painful to watch this considering it’s $3500
I do agree. Apple's walled garden sucks, but they really are on to something here. The price... ouch. The walled garden... eugh. But get me a few real killer apps? Yeah, I can see buying it despite all my misgivings.
Señores, hoy será un gran día, jerry lo hizo de nuevo
Expensive plastic
the metal scraping is the worst sound ever
Bro really compared Ijustine with MKBH...
I fucking just had enough time to yeet my headphones away when I saw you approach the aluminium with that knife. holy fuck
Your case and wallpaper is very amazing.Where i buy it ? Thank you
Please can we see you put it back together 😅
Apple brought their overpriced 💩 products on new lvl 🤣 this is probably the biggest waste of money I've ever seen 🤣🤣
Dont get me wrong I despise Apple as a company but that just hurt to watch
It's always great to see to what lengths Apple goes to make sure these things are unrepairable.
They only used expensive materials and manufacturing processes where it DIDN'T matter. The things that will break are the cheapest to replace, but cost the most through their repair program. Everything screams focus on profit
اللهم صل و سلم على سيم على سيدنا محمد  ياربي انصر اخواننا بفلسطين
It would be cool to get that Vision Pro even though it is destroyed i could say I had the first apple vision
this guy makes me question my life choices
My heart!
Me buying the vision pro for my nephew. My nephew:
You must to have really good sponsors when it doesn't even hurt to brick a brand new and functional €3500 device to pieces?" 😃
niceee
are you planning to return it, because i might have bad news😂
I saw this instantly when Jerry posted it. I couldn't belive the outside of the glass was like that. Thanks
Children in africa could have eaten that vision pro....
Painful to watch..
no matter how many times i watch u destroy many expensive things... it still need a courage to watch it
Apologies, but until technology advances to the point where we have a holodeck similar to what's seen in Star Trek, I'll remain underwhelmed by any gadget that requires wearing on the head.
it actually bothers me watching him destroy something so expensive lmao
WHO ELSE 'CRINGED' N  GOT A WERID FEELING WHEN U HEAR HIM SCRATCHING THE SURFACES 😅
Yay Jonny Sins reviews apple products
Stop bro I can’t look at this
This hurts my teeth...
Apple likes to suck money from people
what are you doing?
Oye en momento le iba a meter yo fuego a mi cara y tener miedo a que se me quemen las gafas?
Must be Nice, when your so cool that tech companies like Apple give you their latest products for free n you get to destroy them💪🤞👍💯
3k plastic lol
I think you're the first to mention the higher voltage of the battery; that explains so much! So many YouTubers have been talking about how it's only around 3000 mAh, but none have mentioned the  35.9 Wh. Battery marketing really needs better standards :(
🤚🏻
bro he rigged the whole apple vision pro :( i wanted that
ASMR for masochists
Glad you brought up accessibility for the UI control. My daughter is missing fingers and the "click" may not even work in her case.
let Tim Cook see this video and let's see if he could laugh again...
just like the iphone in 2007 im waiting for the Second and 3rd vers of the product b4 thinking of buying one due to price and also to see how many peeps will buy it also not to forget watching the stocks and how investors treat this apple hill climb.  all in alll its Super cool techhh !! ;)
Be a gentle man
you get what you pay for
Jerry bro you are a destroyer 😂
Thanks jerry
Meta quest 500$ or this for 3500$
i cant believe you didnt disasamble the batery
Buy Monalisa next and let's see what's in there
Warum sie Apple Vision pro  kaputt machen . Er spinnt es😂😂😂😂
I guess this video should be titled as "Apple Vision pro Postmortem"
tim must be going crazy watching this video hahaha....
how many times did he put those shattered glass on his eyes though 😂😂😂😂😂
a part of me died watching this video. how do you have the guts to do this 😭i wanted to watch it when it first came out but i felt so anxious so here i am, watching it 3 days later after contemplating
I can’t ses the video the sounds of scratches are made me sick 🤢
i laughed i cried ... i watch jerry piss away 4K
I'm not an apple fan boy but , putting dual micro fans on top of 2 world class chips and functioning without overheating or making sound of the spinning fans is engineerly is an insane achievement wow😮 !! Respect !! This vision pro tech and engineering is a work of art in every aspect!! It's still ultra expensive tho 😅
Wow this vision pro is not good to buy
This video is like meditation to me.
Holdaminuta, why you are not disasemble battery pack ? where the chapter 2 for that vid ????
Got goosebumps as watching him tearing it down
“Keep you in the Oasis longer” 😂😂. Fr though Ready Player One might be scarily accurate to reality within the next few decades
this is hard to watch
كسرها
Wait, u paid $3000+ to phuck up the AVP? smh.oh wait he got Apple Care lol
Bro expects it to be made out of all metal, like make more sense
Warning some of u may find this video disturbing 😭
Cool tech but i still think VR is one of the biggest wastes of time out there.
So, now tell me why all of the reviewers praised it for the well build quality and using glass ...
This is definitely the exact opposite of ASMR.
ＧＯＤㅤ乂ㅤオビトㅤ！
,🤚
11:28 — Seems like a ton of alternative input methods are already available in accessibility settings. For example, dwell control doesn’t require any physical movement at all.
for every time u brake a part of it i fell something inside of me brake like an arrow to the heart
Bro woke up and chose violence.
cries in poor..
I'd like to try it but would never buy it.
I'm empress ❤ I'm searching your channel long time ❤ I'm old subscriber your 129k subscribers i think I will subscribe your channel ❤
What we dream he destroys 😅bdw nice
thank you Jerry for making me hate this plastic glasess ...
using the lighter on the Fabric is pure gold work.
My chest hurts after seeing this
Auch, this video was painful to watch😑
I don't know what is more of a turn off: The price tag, or the fact is was built with the inability of repair in mind. Granted, this IS Apple we are talking about here.
The chinese kid in the apple factory watching this video : 😐
man if i only can get hands on this i will have fun exploring it in deep and may even make it fungchen as new
this is too painful to watch😂. and we thought in 2008 a guy buying and smashing a ps3 console  was insane
for what you pay for this constant surveylence device they could have made it completely bullet proof, but they want you to break ti so you go and buy another, fuck apple
Bro just destroyed my whole years income. Don't do it on a macbook🥲
I guess they don't plan to sell any in Europe, here they'll have to be repairable. Also, 3500 for a piece of plastic? ahahah no thank you.
Wow that’s. Really nice phone case…I don’t care for the internal mechanical image but the sides of the case looks really nice..too bad the case is probably $40+
this is so cringe bro
But plastic is best. Light and tough. It doesn't matter if you scratch up the outside of the unit, the outside is just there to protect the insides. Know how often I had to replace the screen on my dropped phones back when they were made of plastic? Fucking Never.
This is like watching Surgeon Simulator but for electronics.
Imagine being able to spend about $3,959 on a device just to break it…I know this is his business both figuratively and literally but man that must be nice…I’m sure he’ll probably make that money back in a month or two as this will be a popular video…ahhh first world problems lol…anyway I love these videos
Uhmmm Mr. Jerry? , Can I have the already damaged APPLE VISION PRO you just destroyed?🥲🥹
Diese ganzen Fingerabdrücke auf dem Display 🤯
Jerry once again shocking the whole nation by destroying yet another apple product
I am sure that Apple manufactures are feeling pain in their chest after seeing this teardown 😂😂
Jerry try to make a custom phone
lo que hace la gente por visionado....
9:00 …
no no no
“Tears of loneliness” got me 😅😂
Thats sick, the amount of tech that goes into this.. thanks for doing this!!!
$3500 for lenses and front glass made of PLASTIC. This is nonsense
I wish i had the money to get it, i hope that later they launch a new one so that one can be a little cheaper by then 😂
3500 bucks for unusable ski goggles, nice
First one who did this With Apple Vision Pro 🥶 😂400000₹ 🤮
انت رجل مهم على الناس مشاهدة محتواك 😂🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just ban him 😂he hurting all electronics 😢 Edit : but it’s entertaining
Could something like this help someone with one eye? Imagine all of the info is overlaid into the functional eye, you'd effectively regain your peripheral vision
That build quality is absolutely embarrassing at that price point... It's not GLASS on the lenses or face??
Who the hell uses devices with knives Mr. Jerry?
What did this Apple Vision Pro do to you ?? 😭😭RIP💀
Isn’t it engineering at its best
That 10:04 sound always sends tingles down my spine 😭
ei shalaaa ki kortesos?
you're not real.
"It's truley, a work of art" *SCRATCHHH*
Wau. Super objavili ste že veci sa dajú ničiť. Ešte to skúste namočiť do vody a zistíme nečakané že to bude mokré.
What is pro in it ?
He is destroying 2 months of my salary like nothing bruh I'm shaking right now 🫨
Wish I knew what it looked like before you destroyed it. 😢
The experience and in hand Quality of Apple will never be replicated by Android 🤷🏻‍♂️
Theres something almost unholy about seeing someone destroying expensive brand new things
It’s not plastic it’s a plastic film which covers the glass. It technically is a screen protector
You know how many oculus quests you coulda bought instead? Too many
I’ve had a vr headset for around five years and him scratching the lenses was extremely uncomfortable
God this was so hard to watch. But I couldn’t stop 😬
For what it's worth releasing a Vision Pro first was a smart move. Even if they made a regular Apple Vision it'd be too expensive to justify for the average joe but Apple Fanatics would say "I'll wait for the Vision Pro".
Very expensive for me😢
Claro, pq alguém vai comprar uma parada desse valor pra passar um estilete nele...
FYI there are some Shortcuts to send delayed text messages that you can make. I haven't used one lately but it did work.
such a unique tear down! Can I get the trash to challenge myself putting them together :)
It feels like a shame to destroy something that people worked on and which used limited natural resources just to get views.The world is already filled with trash to the brim. Buying something just to destroy it and throw away is nothing I can appreciate.
Please do hololens... 😔
Hell, that was some tech horror show :)
thx Jerry! haha you saved me 3500 bux from this horror of a teardown
It has a plastic film infront of the glass..so it is technically not plastic
I guess plastic was used to save the weight.
With all the complex signal and processors hardware, is there concern of dangerous  radiations that can harm user's eyes in the short or long term usage?
People should watch this first before even considering buying this apple product, holy fuck its so BAD
👎
3500 dollar to look like a crazy person best tech in the world xD
That end was hilarious 😂
Lit when everyone is craving it this man destroy it for testing! Please send me one 😂
You indeed have immeasurable patience ! ! !
This guy destroys every tech I’ve ever seen
Ppl hasTripophobia Arachnophobia, i do not know the phobia name for this vid, i get stress out watching him scratch the hardware, thumbs up i just discover i cant commit to watch this vid😢.
Isn't anker the same company behind that really bad doorbell camera
Use guantes al momento de hacer las pruebas.
Noooo😢😢😢 please don’t do that
market price 3500 real price 1000
damn that's wasteful!
តាប៉ិក JerryRigEverythingគាត់teardownផុយ១ហើយបង
Wow, thanks for testing the limits of the hardware.
bro u just rig my dream 🥺
never understood their obsession with aluminium unibody. it just makes repair hard and unnecessary manufacturing cost
Tears of loneliness 😅
It's already overpriced for AR/VR glasses. While I get they needed to make it as light as possible,  it's dumb that they make repairs cost so much for such cheap materials. They could have made a more user friendly product that's easy to repair but this seems like a overpriced scam to me.
The product fits perfectly with my iPhone. I want to buy an Anker charger now.
i only saw destruction of $3500 in this video 😂🤣
As someone who wants one but can’t afford one this hurts so bad to watch 😂
Wish i had money to buy this..
nah, why....
How do you just destroy my imaginary life savings
Hololens has for AR another concept. It's also pretty impressive.
It hurts! 😬
very satisfying video
anyone from the vision pro team 😂
4:18 ASMR
What you think... How many aplle fans passed out while he used the knife brutal way on that surfaces?
It went from scratching to breaking the whole apple vision pro 😂.
would you spare this for me pls ill use it for good i live in ethiopia so pls send me this if you can
As a broke person this hurts to watch but very educational
The hell did Apple do to you?
No worries, no one but utubers is getting this 😂
3500$ and not even Sapphire WOW!!!
800 dollars for a adhesive attached plastic surface is crazy not just that but the fact the lenses are plastic too you get one tiny scratch on the lense the vision is distorted forever
Am i only one who mute all his video while watching?. Those scratches sound gives me CRINGE 🫣
God created you to teach us Humility !
I feel like this would definitely be used to watch 🟧⬛️ but when you mentioned that the speakers are loud enough to be heard by other people, I don’t think so.
Why to pay 3900$ to a pair of scubba dives while you can pay 1500$ for all vr tech you need in one buy and keep the other 1400$?💀
You just break my heart 😅💥
I was feeling a physical pain watching that
This definitely puts the "tear" in tear down. I'm not an apple person but my soul hurts. :P
Apple is charging $800 to stick a piece of plastic-glass shield on the front part?
That chinese kid watching this vision pro he had made with extra hours get destroyed in-front of his eyes.
Tears of loneliness ☠️🥹
Jerry gives nightmares to apple 😂
Just wait for 6 months, chinese companies will introduce this same piece of tech in half of its price
I am in so much pain while watching this. You´re such a horrible person XD
Apple improv there build quality just because of this guys 💀
That's absolutely embarrasing wth.
Why I'm too scared/afraid too watch this video😅
No sapphire glass or titanium?💀
Calling it a work of at and also destroying it lmao
brother I've been following you content from long time now i have question please is there any tier down season that you have cut your finger?
I understood nothing but learnt many things
good old apple having their shit cost infinite money to repair and being so easy to break its almost a certainty ur gon be breaking it
NOOOOO
Aah $3500 aah that hurts
3500bucks for .. what reality is: it will scratch and the cost of replacing that tiny piece is just .. absurd  but then again, just the typical apple and enough people will still buy this overpriced crap ..  And yeah for devices to have so much .. 'do not repair' baked into the design .. (i think thats where they honestly spend most money on) .. its just a sad disgrace.
Hello there. I just saw a pretty interesting phone. Check the Nubia Z60 ultra. I'd love to see a video from you about this one. Unde display selfie camera.
Cool
this video traumatised me
Another trash from apple.
why just why u clould have given it to me atleast give me thoes which u destroyed imma still use it
Super Anna Meru Rich 🤑 pepople
it feels funny watching him destroy things that go for thousands of dollars and hearing him not sound like he isnt scared about his money while doing it
Does it harm the eyes? like phone
What a trash product
People who buy Apple's shit don't care what it costs, they only care that they spent more than you, and if you can afford it,  then it obviously isn't good enough for them, so you need to make another one and make it even more expensive than the last one.
i cant stand the scratch sound, but i'm keep watching
2:05   $3500   But 2 lakhs 90 thousand Indian Rupees (₹290000)   Almost impossible to buy this product from.... middle class Indians 😢😢😢
If this product explodes the user eyes are b🍳🍳👀
apple glass 799 usd, chinese plastic replacement 5 usd ( free shipping ) + cost of replacing, hehe
Man destroyed 2.9 lacs indian rupees😮
😂😂😂😂
I have a degenerative disease (SMA) and i really wish that this kind of product have accesibility features
omg you did it. i love you Jerry
Orang beli pada sayang barang, cuman abang ini doang yg beli buat ditesti segala macam yaampun 😂
Mojrim wd 97 😂😂😂
This one hurt, a lot.
🤣 epic video
Apple will make people into cash cows. Which is fine. Pay to a tech company, fine thing to do. Well, only if it wasn't patented and licenced and protected by lawyers...
Does it still work?
Hitman tests the agency's new device
Bro have personally arguments with apple
;) wow, the most luxurious destruction i’ve seen (or made myself) so far
Mess up your world view, literally, figuratively, and economically.
“I subconsciously ducted” that’s why folks our age aren’t meant to venture into this VR world. We look ridiculous 🤣
Seriously the build quality of apple products is what makes them really special, you spend without really feeling ripped
Everyone made us see how premium it is, JerryRigEverything showed us how trash it is.
What sort of unboxing is this
Don't waist your $3500 dollars
3500 Dollars successfully wasted
Is this what they call 'Cutting edge technology'?
lmao 3500 for something that will look awful within months.
Технику создают чтоб ей пользоваться, а не убивать тупа ради лайкосиков и просмотров! Мир не справедлив, кто-то голодает а другие с жиру бесится 😂
I can still take that sir.
yikes i would pay 200 max aint no way its worth that price
Yo fun fact the front part is actually a screen protector i saw a video of someone dropping it and it shattered and peeled off but idk if it was fake but i doubt it
Apple Care Protection Plan will replace ? :D
Only Apple can combine the benefits of both worlds, the scratch resistance of plastic and the durability of glass. oh wait
no mercy
a 3500 dollar piece of plastic!!!! PlASTIC!!! 😅
Apple knows what they doin !
I have been waiting for your video and finally got it.  If there is a sadness in your mind, you can wait. 😢
gen aplha arrived
اشحال درت خو
I will be utterly gentle with it. I won't even have one, so gentle in fact!
I want a VR headset like Robocop’s Helmet. Tnx. By the way, 2 hours battery for 3900 uss? No thanks
Ngl, not a fan of apple products, but the Vision Pro is a really cool thing.
Some more questions i hoped for your video to answer were more durability tests. Everyone and their mother is taking it appart, so i dropped out after 5 minutes. I would have liked to see: - scratch level test on the lenses - scratch level test on the camera glass - drop tests - head bang into things test
bro please parcel those unused item to ma hom address
I'm glad to see nothing of value was lost here. Destroying those things is probably the best use for anyone out of these muppet goggles
I think somebody in apple addetti erroneously a 0 to the price. 3500 for that plastic brick...take care of your mental health apple and mostly who buy their products 😂
НЕ ОТ БОЛЬШОГО УМА 😡 ВЫ ПОРТИТЕ НА ВСЕОБЩЕЕ ОБОЗРЕНИЕ ЭЛЕКТРО ТЕХНИКУ.
apple sucks point blank 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣apple care is a joke
Se agradece que el audio esté en español
How do you sleep at night?😂
It is not worth 3500
The engineering on this is absolutely amazing
ahahha...oh nice videos......
Bro fucked apple vision pro
lol 3500$ for a plastic screen protection... where are spent those 3500$ ?
Bro is doing the thing which I used to do when I was young and got a new toy 🧸🪀
BRO DESTROYED 3500$ LIKE IT WAS 35$
Hallo Jerry rig alles
Love from India
waching how you destroy it is ... wort thing i ever seen
It was worse than a horror movie experience for me 😩
Is this video adsense can replace one price of that stuff
If apple would have created a video while assembling Vision Pro, this poor unit's life could have been saved. Damn you Apple😅
I knew this was coming but watching something that expensive get destroyed for education was painful
Help keep out the tears of loneliness....!! Perfect...
you can schedule texts with shortcuts on iphone lol
😮😮
Your cutting technique at 8:45 is making my Totin' Chip-wielding inner Boy Scout panic.
This was so painfull to watch
No wayyyy hahah
Unilad going mad on facebook about this video 😂
Man hes truly ruthless 😂
Attention!  if you have heart diseases, do not watch this video.
Apple....😂😂
apple users will have a heart attack if they saw this video..
best destruction videos,,
Bro is destroying someones Dream
You are probably the first person to look okay in these, lol.
bro loves physically violating apple
2015 Samsung Gear VR 2024  Apple Vision Pro
R.I.P. that apple vision pro 😭
Hardest video to watch
this is where smartphone ends
C’est difficile à regarder
😂
Người tạo ra sản phẩm chắc chắn nể bạn. 😂😂😂😂❤❤
А после ремонта эти очки будут разыгрывать? Хотел бы по учавствовать.
Get a EMF meter and measure the radiation out of the mask on your face!!! What’s the bet it’s crazy high levels! Cooking your brain and eyeballs 😂
thanks for sacrificing $3500
bro why
1000 abuelas jajajaja se mamo
Very cool I like the way you show details of gadgets with teardown, thank you
If you can destroy one then I believe you can give me one too.
you are wrong this time you said you need $800 to replace the front glass but it's made out of plastic
Tears of loneliness   😂😂😂😂😂😂
выглядит как очень сложный механизм
No way Jerry.
can you check the EMF coming out from these things? the bluetooth alone is just too much, please try to see the EMF exposure
No fire alarm? You home insurance just went up!
Watching this video in Apple vision pro😂
As always, I was against Apple, mainly because of their prices... Apple Vision Pro actually looks like something useful at this price, although... I won't buy it anyway because I can't afford it xD
it hurts to watch this lol
I can probably still put it together and save me $3500
Anita max wyn
This is the respectful version of techrax
All that money wasted
😂Its price is high and its materials are very poor
If I reincarnated into a tech device, I sure wouldn’t wanna reincarnate into one that’s gonna be reviewed by you
dont be so harsh on vision pro... pleaseeeee
Idk why would he destroy it
Ohhh you attack my heart
Overpriced poc this tech is not good won’t ever have one
Honestly? This is slightly discorcerning; the look of the internals, the amount of paste and cooling necessary to make this thing operate “safely” enough looks like a straight up nightmare. Hopefully none of these blow up in people’s faces buuut we’ve always known apple doesnt really have the best reputation in keeping things from exploding and overheating
This is a relatively small gripe, but could you maybe consider dulling or even muting some of the scraping sounds? I don't know if it's just me but it's genuinely uncomfortable to listen to the box cutter on aluminum, it sends chilly goosebumps down my back and just gives me a bad reaction. I've had similar reactions to chalk on chalkboards (although oddly not nails).
Could’ve gave that to me
1:18 LMFAO 💀
Ofcourse Apple would make its 3k to 4k$ product out of breakable plastics so you can send it in for a 1000$ repair of a new plastic breakable screen. LMFAO
I watched videos where people wear it outside and they looked soo weird. They walk weird,  moving hands in air while typing keyboard.
Yikes, corporations are delusional with these inflated prices and terrible build quality
tears of loneliness
These things should be damn near indestructible for how much they cost. It’s ridiculous.
2:11 plzz nooooo BIG NOOOOOO😭😂😂
I'd love to see him destroy a Tesla
🤚🏽
Insane
This is painful to watch... 😬
@Apple
This got me like 🤯😤
11:04 11:06 11:07 11:09 11:10
😢😢😢😢😢😢
mindless tests
Tears of loneliness
i figured it was going to be a piece of junk
You violated that pair of Apple sunglasses
hearing you scratch metal in every video hurts my teeth
Barbarian
Ah here we go waiting for ya
the scratch test ....... sheeesh
i felt pain when he destory it
Who cares if the glass gets scratched? You’re not looking through it anyway.
no tear down for the battery pack?
A2d soldiers 🪖🪖 assemble
$3500.00 Hell Nooooo
this is pain
Do congolese rights not mean anything to you? Have you truly not seen anyone talk about the horrible cobalt and lithium related exploitation happening in the DRC? Stop buying apple products. Boycott for human rights
if it isn’t our beloved 1# apple screens hater
This was PAINFUL.
all that money for plastic, what a joke apple fans are
woooa
I also hear shit like this costs like $20 bucks in parts. Criminals.
You've got a $3,500 product just to destroy the glass on Youtube  for everyone to see?   wow.. You have have more money than you know what to do with I can't help feeling keeping such a expensive piece of kit alive could be more valuable.
JerryRigEverything is a mentor to me, a kind and super smart guy. Much love to you and your lovely wife Jerry. But I must admit I got a bit stressed watching you destroy a $4000 Apple VR headset.😂
Warning: This video contains material which will offend Apple FanBoyz and may put them into a tizzy. Seizures may start as well as cat like chattering with moans of ,"my precious" being stereotypical. Heart palpitations and lose of bowel control have been reported.

If these symptoms occur, immediately administer passionflower tea and pudding. A shot of testosterone is also highly recommended.
12:35 fin.
Apple owner-🤯🤯🤯🤯😲😲😨🙄
Destrucción total
bro you just can gimme this vision pro but u destroy ed it
I will never ever get used to seeing you destroy these expensive products
Am I the only who gets the chills anytime he uses that blade on aluminum/metal? Like nails on a chalkboard!!
The aluminum frame absolutely is a work of art. Beautiful. I would enjoy manufacturing those.
I wouldn't say marks on plastic is unrepairable. You can buff plastic out with something like polywatch.
I heard another creator say it's made of glass and the top layer is plastic or something like that
Bro is the calmest tech reviewer in the world
no plastic = HEAVY as HELL.....bad for your nose, head and your ear.
I fell like all this video was, was of some guy DESTROYING a $3500 piece of tech for fun. I mean the scratch test, YOU TOOK A KNIFE AND CUT THE GLASS FOR A SOLID MIN. still entertaining
Anker does not make a single bad Product.
I knew this video would be soon
So much for no more lightening cables
i think you are the master of @a2dchannel
monetization on this video probably paid for another apple vision pro
"Not at least until they have scheduled text messages" .. HAHAHAHa
Hey can I have the one you took apart? Lol I’m broke but I’m an electrician so I feel like I could put it back together
"Feels like it's been kitted with the love of a thousand grandmas." is a wild thing to say.
For 3500 dollars, I expected it to be real glass and not whatever apple marketed them to be smh
It always bothers me how noticeable it is that Jerry uses more force when going up in hardness pick. For continuity and more accurate results should the pressure used not be the same with all pick hardness levels? I've always felt this test has skewed results.
You are the best 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Hell yeah screw Apple
is it still working?
Tears of loneliness 😂
“It’s plastic” *shows that it’s glass
Painful 2 watch
It's like watching someone burn $100.00 bills ouch.
What do you do with the gear after you’re done destroying it?
I was really good at those wheres waldo books as a kid 😂
No maa Broo mejor regáleme unas vision pro T.T
Imagine being on 12ms ping for real life 💀
$799 without Apple care - one non-Apple smart glasses about $300 to 600.  😮
7:31 remembering that 1st and last time I successfully attempted to replace a cracked screen on an iPhone 4S for a friend who was deaf that absolutely needed her phone screen to communicate at no charge as well as purchased a rugged otterbox case along with a durable screen protector. Simply screws that screw into more screws that was 3 or 4 layers deep into the design. My dedication & commitment was strong to the cause although I wanted to give up. Another opportunity came about to replace an very badly cracked iPad screen as a repair job to a friend/client, that one made me throw in the towel and purchased a used iPad from Craig’s list faster and cheaper. Knowing all of that along with this teardown video I can only think of the insanity that would ensue to build it, let alone repair at an certified apple tech for a punny paycheck while apple charges $800 yeah nah I’m good rather buy a samsung tv and I hate what samsung exports to the west.
Pro tip, apple makes their products for money, not for convenience
Why haven't jerry rig everything has not tested tesla for durability test and teardown yet ... i really wish to see the deeper groves at level on tesla
something for that much i would expect to withstand maybe like at least a 7 on the scratch place its embarrassing it shows that its so overpriced like every other product
thats so amazing. the fact that they packed so much into something so little to do so much its like what they did with phones all over again. I'm glad it took as long as it did its a technologic marvel
apple staff watching jerry video in meeting room 👁️👄👁️
لماذا
you had me at 1:18 “knitted with the love of 1,000 Grandmas” now picture that room… boy does that room have love in it 😂
been waiting for this vid 🤣
Me gusta que los videos tengan la versión en español
Just what is really wrong with you ? 😂😂😂😂
No lo destryas bro, mejor regalamelo.  Don't destroy it bro, better give it to me. 😂
once again apple creating the most fragile products to ever exist
usen este comentario como botón para liberar la ansiedad genereda por este video: 👇
10:04 Nobody pray for me It been that day for me.
Seeing him wear the vision pro after destroying is like seeing someone wear a dead animal's face
if you dont want the glasses pls give me ahah
Oh nooo plz no 😢 I don't have the money to buy it and there are people who break it 💔
iPhone.👎👎👎👎👎
The apple vision pro being so popular reminds me of iphone 7 and 8 when everyone would destroy them or drop them from heights
crazy teardown experience!! Thanks Jerry!
This guy is the WhistlinDiesel of Tech.
😂😭
i was always waiting for the slip up with the blade!
good job Jerry, us love you.
I just thought the bottom layer was glass and the top layer is plastic...
Who got the Ready Player One reference? :D
bruh
Only pigeons can buy this....
ASMR voice slowly and methodically destroying a $3500 gadget is just what I need to fall asleep
I really think that was the smartest thing a human will ever be doing with these.
Amazing ❤
Respect you did that video 👍
Im honestly not surprised with how fragile Apple products are.... Apple products have always been fragile cheap trash years behind other brands. Even One Plus brands with half the cost for their product have better durability than Apple trash.
Its plastic what?  *It's
Next step: Skip the Intermediary Sensors and send vision and hearing signals directly into the optic and cochlear nerves.  Step after that: Skip the nerves and project directly into the brain. Then you basically unlock the matrix.
This was one of the most painful things I’ve ever watched
I am clenching my teeth watching this . Painful to watch
will keep this in mind next time i take a box cutter to my £3500 headset!
🔥A2D Soldiers Assemble 🔥
😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
watching you destroy hurt because I want one so darn bad but felt good cause I know I can never afford it :)
Horrible
Imagine spending 4k just to destroy it when you get home.
Cant wait for plainrock124's video now
Why unrepairable and permanently wrecked? Wouldnt polishing be able remove the scratches like on car lights for example?
Wll you are expected to buy the new model every year.
Apple: selling expensive plastic
"Oh shoot I forgot to record"
So what I am seeing here is that Apple put in $200 worth of effort into a product that was supposed to be worth $3500. Just get a Meta Quest, you get the same material and durability as the Apple Vision Pro and actually worth the money.
*You could feed starving Indians with the money!*
Nice revwiew  ... but this tech was born dead ... the LG transparent pannels just killed it ...
"titanium iphone:" breaks easily  vision pro: breaks easily
The build quality is the same as what i expel in the morning....Shite!!
android users favorite channel is this
I feel pain watching this, aahh
i was as surprised as you!!!
Tim cooked after watching this.
To me this headset still seems like a Smartphone atached to your face considering its functions, let's wait to see how it goes when it starts getting apps cause right now with that price i rather get seven Quest 3's and get even my dogs in VR with me lol
I love the comments about the headband strap
Ima be completely honest, don’t buy this shit. Wait a good 5-10 years when this comes down to the cost of your phone. Oh wait that also costs a limb
Oque ele vai fazer com esse video é 10x a mais o valor do aparelho, ta safe 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
im convinced this guy is a psychopath
Now put it back together
It should come with a tiny fire extinguisher
Good that you made that money back 😂
I would like to see the assembly video, after this  😁
Watching you destroying it kind of hurts, ngl.
scheduled text messages? you mean like with the shortcuts app? i use them all the time. Guess it's time for you to switch over.
Not designed to be repaired...more like designed to not be repaired :D Good Job, awesome video.
Why the hell is this thing $3500!? A full steam index doesnt even cost half as much as that like holy cow!
i watched this video from the quest 2
thought you were slick with that movie reference
Hy jerry I can use the broken glass Because i can't see with my right ayes Thank you for the video I love you
You could have removed the 2 white rubbery pieces with the earpieces, there is a hole next to each and if you poke they get unlocked, like the battery cable out of the battery.
As a Swedish subscriber, I really appreciate the use of smörgåsbord.
Imagine Jerry bring that pieces and claiming Apple care.
the price of an old civic and they can't even put actual glass on it
hope you bought apple plus care+++
I'm buying it - 'The love of a thousand Grandmas' is just what I need.
😂😂😂😂😂 فنكوش
i ll wait for an android version to come out at a quarter of the price (some day)...
Tbh it’s balls
The worst part about this video is the way he says the letter S, my ears genuinely hurt so bad
Noooo! Why are you doing this
honestly that felt so painful, but seeing the inside hardware was cool, my scratchphobia was heavily triggered tho
As I know ( not 100% facts just what I saw ) they do have some accessibility options like the ones he mentioned
Jerry the nextday : Well, it's seem that's a problem with persona , can you check please !?
Yapple
you can schedule text messages w/ automations
Make a guided sleep story, i really like your voice
This hurt to watch
Setting the strap on fire is so random lol
just return it after the video lol
at 4:22 when u were scratching the aluminum i swear my ears bled out
ITS PLASTIC!!... So, like every other product in the past 2 decades?....... Jesus christ.
cheap shit plastic and aluminium from the chinese market can be assembled for $10 but sold for $3500
These videos are kinda therapeutic
13:19 bro? Its broken😊
This video is so satisfying 😊
yeah destroy that dystopian nightmare machine
Feeling 😔 sad
This one I cringed at the destruction…  Funny story, I learned to repair iPhone 5, 5+, and 6 from @jerryrig and had a small side business in college repairing my classmate’s phones
w
watching him completely ruin a 3.5k hardware 3d goggle, gives me shivers down the spine!  i cant! i litterally cant watch it any more! im suffering too much!
This gave me so much anxiety
💔😢
Apple 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
Bro, so good video. I'm watching you at this time of night.
My favorite part of this entire video was how you describe the speakers. Quite enough to last down directly into your ears and loud enough that the neighbors can hear them! Totally epic
scratching the lens hurt my soul
Garbage for premium price. :D
I think you hit on what mkbhd missed in his tests. This isn't a snapshot phone. That's what iPhones are for. Great video. Subbed!
Its plastastic!
I cringed incredibly hard seeing him scratch test this,  not even the scratching sound
My dream he is destroyed 😢❤
I've noticed more American Youtubers using metric. Thank you for that.
Made for people that want to lose eye vision. Good job Apple. More and more people are wearing glasses nowadays, but not due to genetics, but due to their habit and obsess with LCD/LED screens, pixels in general - it's more dangerous and serious than drug obsession; same goes for sugar - if someone was about to give you a chocolate bar, you would be happy, but the number of people dying from diabetes is 3x higher than those dying from nicotine/drug usage. There's more to this but yeah, I really shouldn't give a f*ck about other peoples health. I just know myself that I will live much longer than obsessed Apple fanboys and people looking at LCD panels longer than looking at the real life itself. Cheers
Agent 47 is planning for casetify demise in AR!
he is just like mom, first harsh and then gentle
I love your reviews!
unnecessary
Why we don't have an update of the bunker ?
Please tell me you wear a respirator when you burn these things!
the suddenly appearing bandaid is not at all surprising considering how often he cuts directly towards his thumb
ur a monster
Can I have something like this but just to watch movies with?
Vandal 😂…and the flammability? If this material was on a sofa in the UK, I’m not sure it would pass UK flammability regulations! 😢
Ok, so after seeing that, I wouldn't pay more than 1700 bucks for it.
fantastic video! I really enjoyed watching it.
Thank you for bringing up accessibility
Its not worth $3.500 but $1.000 should be good enough, $3.500 but made of plastic and small battery capacity, really apple? Even that size of my powerbank can hold up 20.000mah battery capacity including wireless charging up to 15W. I am sure people will complain soon about scratch thing is annoying inside, except there is someone releasing screen protector for those dual lens inside. And one more thing if apple read this, such a CHICKEN close their youtube comment so they don't even care people complaining because they don't give a s*** care about us, people complain can be used for your next gen better improvement.
at 0:47, my heart gave out so i stopped watching. Need Air 😁
The newest face hugger
leave it aloneeee
anyone else notice the addition of the electrical tape bandaid a bit over 6 minutes in? lmao
can you send me one??? they are so expensive...
i applaud this man for testing the durability of a $3499 headset
Не это пластиковое говно явно не стоит 3500$, 799 Максимум и то как игрушка одноразовая, хватает на 2часа 😂 Думаю лучше бы они обучили снимать параметры помещения до мм чтобы переводить потом в проект помещения для строителей и дизайнеров может быть полезным, а пока полная ерунда из-за пластика и времени работы лет через 150 в обычные солнечные очки если внедрят тогда норм )
Me: how to destroy stuff  Google: jerry rig everything 😂
7:15 Zack, do you know , you are a TechBlooded murderer.
I honestly hate the Vision Pro but this hurts to watch. $3.5k just belong demolished 😂.
If any one fix this Apple Vision Pro he will be the next CEO of Apple 🍎
Killer content 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This feels like I'm going to be sick haha
is this the only VR piece of tech you've tried? Have you got an opinion on, say, valve index (yes it's old, but it is actually only now dropping in sales)?
The all black internals on Apple products is such a nice touch
Whoah. I genuinely thought you could see right through it this whole time. Like it was just glass that everything was projected onto.  Then you took it apart and boom! It's all projected onto there? That's sicc.
hahahah u look funny in last shot xD
He butcher this 😂
เสียงตอนขูดโคตรได้ใจ
Can I have this one plz? 10:03 Oh god... NVM lol my soul just left my body..
Oh nooooooo! I'm crying over here.
love of a 1000 grand ma's 😄
So cool to see that much tech in one pair of glasses :D
seems like you cut your thumb again!! 👍👍
Thank you for this in depth review.
This is oddly therapeutic.
Tell Samsung iPhone is back😱
NGL had to build up courage to watch this
First "ready player one" reference I've seen about the vision pro. I thought it would be already a meme by now.
“Never Send My devices to Him” ——Steve Jobs
Why 😢
why hasent any one used this stuf to  make glasses to -20 galsses
the only man who can convince me to listen to his sponsor. also just a brilliant content creator in general
Clean lens from inside in time will ruin, so that's a good point!!
As usual apple gives 💩 and the world goes ga ga 😂
only man who have guts to tear a 3500$  worth device. 😅
I cried watching you destroy this 😢
Woah!!! he absolutely ripped the $4K Vision Pro 🙄
Bro really fucked it 😢😂
I think this is the messiest I’ve ever seen Jerry’s table 🤣🤣🤣
Tears of loneliness 😂
i only can pray for one of thouse, watching a video like that is torture
Tears of loneliness...😂😂😂❤
I wonder how they’ll make it accessible to the visually impaired !
man destroys 4000$ glasses. Me with my 9000$ credit card that i have a hard time paying the minimum....
NEATO!  Great tear-down Jerry.  Looking forward to the re-assembly video :P
dieses Haufen Plastik scheiße kostet 3500 ? Die wissen eben wie man Leute abzieht hhahaha
“Tears of loneliness” lmao 😂
Watching him destroy it was kinda satisfying for some reason…
You know for a fact that jerry bought a new one after the making of this vid😂
3500$ for plastic lenses is wild
this hurts to watch.
Just asking can I have it?
Will be very impressed if we end up seeing a clear version of this from Jerry
JERRY! 3:26 mark - the scream of 1000's grandmothers
This video is certainly worth more than the single wonderful headset that was sacrificed, and that’s saying something
one guy from our india already hacked this😂
Apple always states they're a culture of inclusion, but when they sell an expensive gadget like this it makes you wonder.  Makes me dislike them even more.
Tears of loneliness 😂
THATS FUNNY
Now THAT's what the real tech "teardown" looks like, ripping the wildly expensive poor thing apart and setting it on fire😅 Pretty awesome ;)
APPLE SEE THIS AND CRY
$3500 down the shitter.... LOVE THIS VIDEOS 😂
@ishowspeed
Love  the Casio watch
Real question is when can we expect a X-ray skin?
didn't they say the lenses will be glass? well, it is pretty much as bad as i expected it to be. $2k would be too much already imo. thanks for the painful to watch video.
Jerry always reminds me of 1 life quote... things are meant to be liked and humans are meant to be loved.... ☺
Jerry always reminds me of 1 life quote... things are meant to be liked and humans are meant to be loved.... ☺ Things are just additional happiness in life
Bro violated vision pro before he  even unpacked his battery case😂😂
EPIC BREAKDOWN. Was waiting on this.
DONT DO THIS😖
wow. This felt almost like a fanboy video. Much dissapoint
the sound when he takes the razor to the metal.... my poor soul!
Imagine forgetting to hit record at the end
honestly one of the more painful videos that ive watched of yours
destroying those goggles was the best thing I've ever seen in my life
how do you afford all this stuff!?
Leave it to Apple to charge several hundred dollars for a piece of plastic
Jerry find alien technology
3:52 my man casually explaining the specs of laminated glass and macroeconimics while burning the band like a smoking addict explaining their friends how their day went
please tell me u got that from apple to  test like if not this must be bullet in Ur wallet
An Apple fan is going to see this and lost his/her mine on the first scratch xD
where can i buy the vision pro you had :c
The audacity of some other people displaying 'disgust' at the price of the VP f*cking astounds me. This video in and of itself proves that $3500 is next to nothing considering the man hours and construction techniques and materials and resources it takes to develop and produce one of these things.
✋🏾
He didn't even show the plug that you have to shove up your cornhole, or the mouth attachment you have to suck on to keep the device running
ipod nano screens
How many people with a high degree of spinal cord injury and massive mobility issues (like those who can t pinch their fingers) really have 3.5k $ to throw on this shit? 😆
This is painful to watch...
Aaaaa
jajajajajaj LOL the funnier video i've seen
i love the horrible grating noise of the plastic scratching it makes everything hurt in all the right places ❤❤ great video
I cannot handle watching this guy scratch and destroy something so expensive aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You just made the Apple vision pro Terminator edition
Will that teardown be covered by apple Care? hahahahah 🤣
send back to apple store for repair ..see their reaction
God i wish i had those
The way he says "Don't worry, my patience is immeasurable" is so ominous
😢😅 what did you do to vison pro 😢😢😅
Sweat and tears of loneliness 😂
Quick question, is the Anker power bank compatible with the Android phones? The web store only talks about iPhones...
Hahahahaha   "Knitted With The Love Of A Thousand Grandmas" - JerryRigEverything
most entertaining video.
YouTube, we ask you to fix the invalid traffic bug
Destroying things most of us can’t afford since 2016
can u give me one Instead destroy it
I've seen a lot of your destruction videos but this one hit different.. damn
hey i don’t know you and i this is my first video of you but i like your head
Apple is and always has been complete junk. They're nothing but a money burner for people that don't mind spending money more than anything. I'll stick with Sony. Where technology is affordable with decent customer service and warranty.
Hey jerry, Is your thumb alright?
you broke that man... 🥲 i dont have money for buy that. and you broke that. ohhh maannn... come on 🥲🥲🥲
I have to say the only way to do this properly is to take apart 10 of these pieces of crap. There could be differences in them that you missed by being a cheap skate and doing only a single unit.
😢😮😮😮😮😮
Samsung be watching and will make one but even better and probably the size of ray ban,s watch this space i said it here 1st... XR
u are the rock man
This guy is the sort of guy who would torture a robot/druid. 100% psychopath
Watching him damage and breaking apart something that costs more than I make in a year hurt my soul.
tear of loneliness 😂😂😂
11:34 - а чего не работает, странно!))))
It is so painful to watch this, but at the same time... Thank you for exposing their bullshit.
This made me rage out of pain
Can I have those damage gadget of yours :P
HE fu@ked the Vision of Apple...😁
Awesome video, thank you!
All they did was copy the hololens from Microsoft and added some features that that one doesn't have it's all software it's the same damn thing
Bro just rigged off my 2 months salary's worth device 😂
Fans == Issues.
If you don't want it, can you give it to me?
The way you're tearing it down. It's hurting😖😖 bro..
Am I the only one who hates scraping sounds
😍😍😍
Apple be like: Ye to dhoti khol raha he
10:02 Goosebumps
I would wait till they put a mobile phone chip for calls and messages….
Wonder if dbrand is gonna make a x-ray sticker of a human face to cover the outer display
بقرآن خیلی حیوونی 😂
i fucking hate it when you destroy expensive stuff most people can't even afford...
you are exposing the american technology to your nation's enemy.
I feel sorry for this beauty! There should be a law amendment defending tech material against public harming.
The grand canyon level groove left by a level 9 pick🤣🤣🤣 9:25
😄😂😂😂 this is Real Unboxing of Appl vision pro😅
“Tears of Loneliness” 😅😅😅
What are you doing man, please staph!!
This hurts 😢. $3500 is equivalent to 220500 MZN in my country. I can buy a concrete mixer, a cement block machine, build a small office and start my company. You guys a very privileged and lucky to be able to spend this much just to break it. LIFE MAN, LIFE!   But nice video though! Full support here from Mozambique 🇲🇿.
I love this channel but darn it causes me physical pain whenever he does his durability test….
Why? Uncle, you are like this to me You broke my heart 😢😢😢😢😢
This is one of the worst and most useless things i've ever seen , lol
Them $3,500 plastics are the good ones. People really wanted them.
Ok, this is the real review I was looking for!
"The cover is to keep the sweat and tears of loneliness away" got me 😳☠️
$3,500 plastic is crazy 😭
at least we understand why they cost so much😂
He Just Destroyed My 3 Years Salary 😢😂
Bro you destroyed bad universe,keep it up.❤
can i have whats left of it please
i could have been used that :/
1:17 not a thousand grandmas bro... not grandmas
Not sure if i want to trip with glas on front of my eyes
Scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4,  i can't settle without 6 and 7
I want you to see to test the durability of Bugatti 2024
Man, I think I am late again and you won't have the chance to read it, but iphone DO have scheduled messages. It's done via shortcuts. If you want to I can share my shortcut with you, I use it everyday.
He said “ tears of loneliness” 😄💔
Good job 🥲 jerry
@IShowSpeed
10:03 with headphones on🤤
Dale Earnhardt called he wants his goggles back
Love seeing apple stuff being destroyed 😅
Love the oasis reference
Why would you buy this when it's just a quest with 4x of the price 💀💀
Biggest fear of Apple company is Jerry....
The Daily Mail here in the UK ran a story on your video 🙂
Apple watching this 😢😮😒😡
Indonesia sendiri wkwkww😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Throw away that knife now
why is your voice is clean?
i love it this product is just bullshit... i wonder if ppl buying and actually using this constantly lost their life... you destroying that shit is just awesome <3
Didnt the EU force apple to use usb c so how are they getting away with another propriatary connector.  Its laughable for them to say their using the new usb c standard etc etc in their I phone showcase but then they go and stick another propriatary connector on the apple vision I cant wait for what the EU has to say about this.  And I dont mean the clip part I mean the power bank connector
I’m surprise that this time the Apple product got completely destroyed since most of the other Apple durability videos you try to put the phones back together. 👍🏼
Holy Jesus fuck fucking fuck .... this was hard to watch.
Whole apple team crying in the corner🤣🤣🤣🤣
plastic pro
daaamn I loved this video ❤
seeing the tear down of 3.5k was horrible :p
Basicly the whole video is tell me ur rich without telling me ur rich
2:19 here we go
bkl
3500 worth of scam
Apple Vision Pro users...get a life :D
Any update on the backyard bunker Jerry?
You see vision pro, I see 3999 dollars.
I was waiting for him to re arrange it back. And he did😂
I can Feel the Pain of Apple Team crying in the corner 😅
everyone sais that the apple vision pro is a ""new tech"" even tho it uses almost 10 years old tech that is allready been invented much much time before.... pathetic
Jerry flamed the vision pro 💀
Seeing Apple Ads before the video 🎉
Why im getting uncomfortable 😢 , when he broke bend ,burn  😢
This is SO satisfying to watch 😈😈😈😈
It hurts my feelings 😢
3.25lakh in. indian rupees  just wasted in 13 minutes 😢 anyway most awaited video thanks jerry love from india ❤️
And you returned it to best buy the day after lol
you are the master of pain... and i like it... you do pain, so we dont have to.
حلالت باشه پولی که درمیاری
Why do people love watching nonsense video's like this one?
Bro is destrying the thing that i can't even dream to buy
I went through so many stages of grief watching this get destroyed.
Idk how I feel after he butchered it sad, upset, pissed, anxiety, with a bit of curiosity 🤯
This was extremely satisfying to watch considering the fact that this product only belongs in the garbage being an overglorified VR headset with a stupid lcd on the front.
Лучше бы мне отдал
So... nope not buying... at least for now but since Apple is a sort of "trend setter" not long enough we would see android versions...
This guy is the Whistlindiesel of tech
ouch!!!
Am I the only one expecting to see the internals of the battery? to see if it is just a battery or something else?
It actually hurts to watch this man fr
An awesome piece of kit but plastic on the outside? Wow. I noticed you didn't re assemble this one😂👍👍
Watching people use the vision pro is truly mind blowing. It is so smooth, and will inevitably  be the future.
“Sheer girth”
This is so painful 😖
its a nice piece of engineering , watching those circuits was quite amazing !
My guy just casually scratching a 3500 dollar goggles😅
Man if you can agford to just damage one so easoly, please just send me one for free!
Grand canyon level groves got me
Basically Plainrock124 2.0
just wasted $3.5k
Now I can die in Peace !
sweet 👍
last moment was awsome
Apple fans buying every shit this shitty company puts out is so funny to me
I hope you labelled it all properly. Gonna be difficult to put that back together
it would be fun if Jerry forgot to turn on the video recording before destroying the device for 3.5k$
AVP is a 3500 bucks scam.
watching him destroy apple vision pro makes me so mad lol
3500$ plastic
cant stand this A.I voiceover.
Mantap gak nanggung2 reviewnya😅😊
Zach is a legend in my book now , boy did he created a work of art , a masterpiece
11:46: Battery: _I am safe_ ..no NO
10:03  People who made this: _dead from the inside_
sir please send me one of these. i am poor and could never afford one lol
So satisfying ❤
Jerry right everything including this matrix 😂😂😂
4:19 AAAAAAAAH
is this bird person?
Satisfy level 10000 😍😍
POV: Rich people tired of their money destroying expensive luxury stuff
Very weak 3.5k product 😂
не биты ни крашены
do apple MacBook m3 pro screen test
lool
Bro stop  scratching it
Bro stop scratching it
Bad design
I would have like to see a scratch test on the lens
You mean it can charge as slow as the original chargers… since there are no fast chargers on samsung or iphone
It's cool tech but for the price it's kinda disappointing.
😱
Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation
show this to tim cook. he'd probably cry himself to sleep.
everyone said battery cable is not removable 😂, but apple hide a lighting connector in it
Just wanted to say you look majestic in the profile pic
صرت اتوجع وانت عم تجرحها ياعرصا
nice
Another overpriced product from Apple. 🤣 The Apple brand made the most of that $3500 for sure.
So… You get your scheduled texts.  Then you use iPhone 15 Pro Max.     Interested.  🙂
This is the apple vision, goes ahead and absolutely dismantle the $3500 glasses. love it! :D
Thanks you
The Apple tax at work.
Remember  a good Boy Scout always cuts away from himself   ☝️🤓
The only thing I took away from this is that IPhones cant send schedule text messages. Thats crazy, and I did not know
4:15 best part of the video by a lot.
How about the right to repair? I thought that went through, and the Apple Vision is for sure not repairable.
10:02 the most satisfying part xD
10:03 who else felt that 😵‍💫
I can feel the glass on my hands and in my eyes
Im not believing im watching this
5:47 yeah, tears of loneliness
Apple created a $3,500 plastic masterpiece that scratches if you look at it funny. Good job Jerry! I can't wait to see the durability test in future Apple products
i hate this sound & feel 10:03
Oh wow! durability and torn down.
Everyone was waiting for this!
Cant imagine spending 3500 usd in that to have it scratched in minutes lol.Such an awful screen finish, not even ceramic coating?
this is one painful watch
a very good piece of tech but still overpriced.
Always giving us the ASMR we all need.
Can you ware this with glasses??
I wanted to cry watching this video
Well done 3500$ 😢
Well done 3500$ 😢
bro playing with our thoughts
"Scratches on level 3 with deep grooves at level 4" Legendary line
$3500 gone 😅
I used to do the same when I was 4 years old. Unfortunately, didn't have youtube account back then.
$2,500 for this crap? Yeah no thanks
This man  heartless😁
The Apple care math had me dyin lmfaoo .  Thank you for the video
There is glass under the plastic
You can’t putt real glass 3cm in front of your eyes for safety reasons. The same way sunglasses and prescriptions are made in acrylic, and hesalite for watches in space!
Bro uses safety gloves please, my anxiety drained alot by watching this because the way you using a sharp tools 🫠
while this format of breakdown/teardown is quite informative and helpful, i wonder if there isn't more of a following of this channel that is more in line with fetish reasons than product reviews. hot damn i am STONED.
I cant believe you  burned the band that was Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas...😮
Todo normal hasta que vi la facilidad con la que rayo las lentes principipales interiores, eso no deberia pasar por cado 4k de dinero o no con tanta facilidad, cualquier tela podria hacer microyallones que enoeoren la caludad de apoco que nal
This is a scam for $3500 you can buy a whole car!
Watching from Uganda
Nice ❤🎮
Jerry i Have Question for you,  Why Apple Don't Give You Review Unit ❓❓❓
Samsung made almost the same technology almost a decade ago
I hope i will be able to afford any thing like that in future currently i am broke can't even afford 300$ mobile😢
After destroying every part he is still using screw 🪛
This is my first time seeing this channel and I'm in total shock and awe. I am just bambozelled. Holy crap!
Imagine destroying this stuff and forgot to turn on camera😆
Most people arent playing 3,500$
it pains me so much but i cant stop watching
4000 for plastic
You can make scheduled text messages, tho it takes a little too much effort
Thee innards on this thing are super cool

Apple company will jail you.
just released my first app ever and it's for apple vision pro: "In-Flight Tracker" will get show you your flight data while in the air on the flight. Let me know what you think :)
😂😂😂 tears of loneliness
Can a psychiatrist comment on the pathology of why this individual enjoys destroying things in an unscientific way, like a burglar with a crowbar? What are the underlying psychological and emotional factors?
10:03 geek goosebump
Which back cover do you use in your iPhone?
Iphone 😅usa sus oantallas de smart wash 2 generación jajajan
Gotta say the craftsmanship is amazing
10:03 this is a prime example of when I rub my finger nail on the 3D effects pictures.  If you know you know.
Its the Voice and the gentle slow talk that gets me hooked now, 🙂
This voiceover was tough to get through. WTH
Apple haters are watching this with popcorn 🍿 also me 🍿 ☠️ dymn this feels satisfying
That was kinda painful….. Amazing. But painful.
Does  new tech such vr /ar going to let us live in virtual in Pease without wars  ?
no more " pay peanuts get monkeys " it now " pay gold get plastic " 😃😃😃
Here we go again 🙄
Shit is NOT worth 3.5k 🤦🏻‍♂️💀
yo you can add scheduled text messages in shortcuts, I use it every morning when going to school
Bro is rich 😢
apple fanboys are screaming right now
Only you can do this kind of content. We can only watch tearing a $3500 product that we can’t afford 😂
Now it's time to buy a $500 tempered glass for it 😭.
The internals on this thing are a work of art. Companies should give their engineers more direct, public credit. Apple is the company that brought this thing to light, sure, but who in that company used their vision to make this happen? These people are not just engineers and scientists, they're also artists.
11:32 😎😎 Cool 😊
The amount of tech that Apple has put into the Vision Pro & build quality are atleast 2050 level & we getting it in 2024 that's almost 25 years sooner!
cheap af build quality and priced like it was cut from ruby, sound's like apple
I wanted to cry watching him destroy a $4000  piece of  tech ....😭
Looks like that knife is sharp 😁insulation tape is best bandage ever 🎉
That scratch level is unacceptable for $3500
cooool
omg i cant even afford it and you destroy it
imagine the amount of radiation nuking this will do to your face
ok, first im gonna set myself back $3500. then im gonna scratch the absolute fuck out of it, then im going to disect piece by piece and then leave it as is.
It’s crazy the amount of tech they put inside. I really hope they can make it a tad lighter in the next iteration.
Tears of loneliness 😅
What happened with Jerry Thumb !!!!! Did hi cut it !!!
Utility knives on aluminum, the anti-asmr
I loved this.
I love his videos but my misophonia hates when he drives the blades
I'm surprised its a fire hazard though. Surely they could have made it not burn included in the $3500 price tag.
Bold beast
I wonder if all these electronics being right up against your face is dangerous at all……… ah oh well, at least I can manage my cancer from the surface of the freaking moon
The ready player one reference
Plastic is plastic and Plastic scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at
Soon he will dismantle the space ship...❤
Kinda defeats the purpose of having a glass outer cover if you’re just going to laminate it with a soft scratch-able plastic, Apple?
typing this comment from a m2 macbook pro that is 3 months old and already seeing the keys degrade and battery capacity lower; can't say i'm surprised that the build quality is atrocious
Dude didn’t even turn it on, went straight to ripping it apart 😂
I'm crying from Turkey, I'm watching
Basically it's build pretty well, but should have had glass lenses  But man, $3500 USD
Honestly, this vision pro is nothing less than futuristic. This looks like something you’d see in the stores in 2090, but we have it in 2024! Hats off to apple!
$3500 for this piece of crap
wooooh so much money ...
that headband is gonna fray after a few months of use
Love it
He legit looks like Ready Player One jajajaj!
just like that, the vid already payed for it. With dividends.
Hey ummm is it safe to say you have a slightly used Apple Vision Pro for sell?
Tears of loneliness sent me 😂
your get a thumbs up just for putting it back on. lol
People are so dumb to buy this plastic thing for 3500 😮😂
i knew it
Lmao 😂
the guy remixing the video lmao
I really wish I could see what it looked like with the scratched cameras, but then I realized it would be a screen recording anyway.
Now put it back together 😅
It's hummer time.
Roses are red, violets are blue, I cringed at this video and so did you. Keep at it Zack, nothing is too expensive for a true durability test.
JUST THANK YOU!!!
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Something I have learned is that apple takes number 1 place for the least repairable stuff. Trying to open up a dead apple watch to remove the lithium battery for recycling was hell. The screws are really easy to find, but you need apples own screwdrivers because of their special screws. We did not have that. So the easiest way was through the screen. Smashing it up and picking out the lithium battery was a success! The same goes for the iphones, similar screws but also different. Smash that screen!  I would say the closest contestant I have met with notorious teardown would be JBL speakers. Yes they use universal screws, but the placements really makes you ask yourself "How the heck did they apply them?!". Plus they like to hide them
Apple being anti-repair as usual
Must be nice to have enough money to just throw away $3500. But I guess he'll make more than that off of this video so 🤷
Watching him casually destroy something I want so bad is a really weird feeling
Summary: DO NOT HEADBUTT SHARP SURFACES
first flaw I saw was how you remove and attach power cord.   whoa destruct mode.  how did i miss this channel.  those interpupillary mechanisms are amazing btw.
was this the guy that speeedran upgrading trackpad gpu?
What does it cost m to make this piece of junk.😂
This is cool and also hurt my soul
It's interesting how this costs 3500 but luxury watches can cost even more, BEFORE all the fancy jewels/gems are added.
Is that lawsuit still going?
I can't imagine what was spent on R&D for this product.
Its so surreal watching this
PLASTIC for $3,500😂😂😂 🤡
Its kind of painful to watch this video
The scratch test is hard to watch. It was like seeing a kid using a gold pocket watch as a hammer.
Your thumbnail is a bit click-baity don’t you think?
Para ser un producto tan caro, esperaba que no solo fuera plastico, pero aja...
It hurts to watch this 🫠
Instead of a finger "tip tap" they should make it traditionally like the quest where you instead of using the controller with the laser beam, since this device is $3,500, you use your pointer finger in mid air and control things with it air tap your finger on things your seeing thru the headset
seeing you wreck an item I never plan to purchase is some what pleasant.
The disrespect
Yeah, showing us the price and you gouging the screen nearly gave me a heart attack. For small scratches you might be able to use some polywatch to buff them out.
painful and satisfying
This video hurts my feelings😢 😭
the most brutal teardown. :D :D :D
Nice destruction Zack too bad Apple doesn’t learn from your tests 🤷🏼‍♂️and fix the weaknesses 🤪
ماذا تفعل يا رجل مصر كلها تشاهد الجنون هذا 😃
Magic Leap should be subjected to this and Jibo!
Useless too expensive shit...  By program PC acces, addons like available head super comfort straps ,  powerbank system,  setiings, or even wide of wiev Fecbook Quest 3 beat it . By7 time lower price totaly too.....
You can only watch 😂😂
came here to see you scratch
What happened to the tracks in Spanish? I missed them 😢
Apple users right now probably crying inside with pain 😂
Thank you for your service 😊
I have to wonder if you can melt the laminate off to just get to the less scratch able glass
Hahahaha interesting, now put it all back together.
best invigilating device so far
This should be $800-$900 the most.
What a colossal waist of money. Apple doubling down on how easy it is to milk iSheep. 😂
Балдёж
I want more people to wear this. If they try to talk to me I can ignore them and pretend their Mike is off :)
Prp proooo
So satisfying!
I'm crying rn
Apple junk 😢
me watching every teardown videos but muted on metal scratches part 😵
Moda wesige putha
This device is in no way worth 3500 dollars. 1500 at best. They 100% over charged everyone to offset R&D costs.
Way too many of these things are going to explode inside the mouths of puppies. This is beyond disgusting and sad. Apple doesn't care, and wants ALL your money.
Destroying stuff for fun, more than 3 times worth my car.
Ouch!  All of this dude's toys must have been fucked up back in the day!
Hey Jerry, can we scratch your Cybertruck? I would like to know how hard the 301 ss is on the Rockewell scale.
The lenticular lens at 9:50 looks like we see on Nanosuit eyeglass from Crysis games.
i wacthed 100's of zacks video...this was the most difficult to watch 😭. not sure why
Looking like a destroying whole universe😢😢😢
If it doesn’t offer an ir night vision mode I’m not interested 😂
Rip
What a tech butchery, but for science
It's*  (I had to)
you must be the spoiled child
دا انت نكتها
2024: here is a device that is not meant to be repaired 😢
plz give me this vision pro bro hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
How much lol uff
Is it just me or does the inside look like ruined Roxy
I schedule text messages on my iPhone. Just use shortcuts 🤷🏻‍♂️
Def not worth 3.5k
Hey FUCK Android and Windows.
Fun to think that you are literally staring at two huge fans attached to your face
10:04 - love that ASMR...
So..much..goose..bumps.
Painful watching that much cash go poof! Well...with the view count it was money well spent, but still hurts to watch. This device might be like the iPhone when we look back in 10 years or so. Certainly looks to be a good VR experience compared to others.
Hello mr jerry can you do Huawe mate 60 pro
Sheeps will always buy LITERALLY ANYTHING from apple at ANY price, it's funny XD
1:17 woah that's a lot of love
I can't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety watching you tear apart these expensive gadgets. The attention to detail and knowledge you bring to each teardown is remarkable. Keep up the great work!
It's soooo ugly, I thought you were going snowboarding or skiing ⛷️
The irony of taking the paper wrap off the battery after obliterating the vision pro
Soo now ur just going to pack it back in the box and return it for a refund, haha
idk why but watching someone destroy something im not able to afford makes me feel weird lmao
Apple will die after watching this
Waiting for the JRE style review of the not a wheelchair 😜
It's weird all the creators worried about stepping on other creators toes
I like how Apple make is usable for people who may not have hands or spinal cord injury. If my back ever gives way, IDE get one of these
I loved seeing the pristine teardown video of ifixit then this chaotic abomination of a teardown
I think VR is where I draw the line, with the exception of a couple games or so. I like to see with my ryes the things around me, I like the separation between me and the content. If I need to sacrifice my perception of my surroundings for some bonus work done or it being slightly more convenient to do.
Bro destroyed the whole vision pro and didn’t even unpacked the power bank 😂
Looks like the least repairable apple product so far
😂😂😂😂😂😂
To think you could feed a poor family for a year with the cost of that… 😞
Fascinating! And also dystopian. Looking at this thing reminds me of that Star Trek TNG episode "The Game" and how it ended up addicting almost the entire crew. They won't catch me though, NEVER!
Aukat se baharwali cheez ko todte dekhliya bhai
Make a teardown skin
just watching jerry destroy things i cannot afford at 2:20AM
He’s got an injury mark on the inner aspect of right thumb from maybe his razor knife slipping from his hand while he was scratching that laminated glass or aluminum surface!!
This was so painful to watch
Auch Jerry 😂
Nice 😂
8:09 Scheduled text message you can find under the "shortcuts" app some what embedded within the iPhone. What a satisfying video. 😅
Finally
When he did the scratch i was actually glad it wasnt glass. Because it would make it more durable, and light scratches can easily be buffed up with compound.  I get the appeal of it being made of glass but only if its thicker than that. I think they wanted it to be glass because it definitely would feel more premium overall for some reason they couldnt make it thick enough to be strong emough so they  have to laminate it.
💔💔😆😆
Can’t handle a knife? Lol
We will see a new era of scratches level at level 3 with deeper grooves    at level 4 😮
3.5k USD... Time to test Meta Quest 3.
Not even remotely impressed with this thing, what a waste of time, money, and materials.
Apple actually... innovating? Crazy times
Alright Alright, I'm gonna ask the real important question: Which side does the teardownskin go on? It has to be instead of the fake eyes right? @dbrand
apple be like: how can we get budget for RnD
seeing you handle shattered glass with your bare hands makes me so anxious
Completely dissappointed how easily you can scratch the interior lenses. Amazing video!
where is Mr. "Will it blend" when we need him the most?
👍👍👍👍
Wow, $3500 and it's all aluminium/plastic..what a joke!!
I'm used to watching you destroying pieces of tech but this time, this video breaks my heart 🥲
This hurts to watch😭
How many seconds does it last when battery is suddenly disconnecter?
Jerry f**ks every thing😂
I like your accessibility comments. I own the Oculus 2 and am baffled at why it doesn't support use while laying down. This would be a great option on all be head sets.
I know I'm not able to buy this, but I'm able to watch this destroying video 😂
Apple will be like , Now i will make 10k dollars device
Its alot of money, but i guess having a light VR headset is good. It does look pretty comfortable, guess you'll just have to treat it very delicately 😅
Hearing "starts scratching at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4" sounds sooo unreal😂 I'm so used to listen 6 and 7 XD❤
And with another video monetized to buy another 5
It's yet another way to separate fools from their money with plenty of Apple branded planned obsolescence.
Last week: scratches at level 7, with deeper grooves at level 8 This week: scratches at level 3, with deeper grooves at level 4
This is a piece of engineering art
Not enough fan to go back to  Iphone until they have features like scheduled text messages & showing time left in hours after adjusting alarm so that to prevent me oversleeping. 😂
Do the quest 2 and quest 3 next now that you're testing VR headsets.
Thx Gabo
The fact having Apple care is the same price as not having to fix the glass is all I need to know Apple has not changed at ALL 😂
Apple scamming it's clients once again 😂
You know that oculus did it before them? There just isnt enough buzz, while the oculus can also play games unlike this apple product
😢 Боль
How would you rate the video out of 10?
"This thing feels like it's been knitted with the love of 1,000 grandmas" lol
"with the love of a thousand gramma" got me
Of course its plastic, the only companies, that can really bend glass in this shape, are located in the west of Germany (Finiglas), and a sub company of them located in Italy. If apple wouzld have used real glass, they would eventually throw 80% of them away, because theyre not good enough
well if it was actually made from GOOD quality parts, it would cost another $3000 ontop of 3500
My real question is do you ever get sued by companies for doing this because you're exposing all their hardware to other competitors or companies who would love to try and remake this all tho  it wouldn't be possible for them to do it but still Samsung is lingering in the background
Durability test for laptop ?
This hurts me to see this 3,500 dollar piece get scratched like that
You can rename this Apple visio pro Snuff film and get more clicks.
I love to watch jerryrig distraction 🥃
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Why your hands are always full of scratch... Man be more careful about yourself
watching him just casually set that on fire unnerved me a bit
these videos are so stressful to watch , i love it
By this video,,  he is going to buy almost 3 more VISION PRO🤭😁😁
Nice Ready Player One reference at the end.
Dystopian vision pro Great video
"knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas" 🤣❤
Que carnificina tecnológica ☠️
I don't like to see how you destroy😢
I’ll build an PC set up for $3500 😂
Video audio: Any coins or keys can scratch permanently.      Video image : scraping a knife very hard
This one hurt!
I prefer light plastic
You gotta wonder what Apple was thinking when they used any kind of plastic to cover the glass parts especially when we’re talking about viewing surfaces, that really is something that SHOULD put many potential buyers off this for now, who knows maybe Apple will see their error and use some nice scratch resistant gorilla glass in future, I definitely would not buy one with the plastic covered front and eye lenses, as that would be scratched in no time and that’s not something I’m going to go into knowing the outcome.  Awesome video as always, can’t wait to see the finished results of the bunker too.
If all people in the world lived as US citizens do today, we would need the resources of at least five Earths per year
Jerry noooooooooooooooo
I have had an iPhone for 9 years and I still miss the scheduled texts lol
I honestly twitch, nearly everytime you were going to scratch the mirrors. It was tortuting to see a $3,500 getting destroyed like that😄
Technologie punisher
6:52 that scene from revenge of the sith where Darth Vader puts on his mask
800 dollar fpr a fuckimg  GLASS 😂😂😂
Wow cool
3.5 million views in 1 day omg..
Nice😂
I wanted a vision pro until I saw this. I don't want to baby my tech.
This video is curiosity torture
Fuck !!! Jerry sir just ruined a literal 4k USD product 😶
It has more parts than a Tesla.
*$800 for a thin piece of glass? that's why I'll never support apple as long as I live*
its not a glass,, but a plastic 😂😂
انت مارح تلتقى بقبرك
Zack with tore down vision pro on head looks like a borg drone from star Trek😂
Is there any reason why they would laminate glass with plastic? They will scratch too easily!
“Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas.” 😂😂
Could we not include the scratching sounds or mute them? My ears are bleeding and my brain is damaged now.. Thanks a bunch!
Watching one of your tear-downs is both a little terrifying and utterly compelling. Can't stop watching and as ever, the best level of knowledge demystifying tech to put a realistic and sane perspective on new equipment. Great work as ever Jerry, many thanks
did you injured your thumb finger for this tear down :(
I know you did it for science but I cried when you lit the love of 1000 grandmas on fire 🔥😭😁😎
Anyone else noticed the band aid he put on halfway through lol must have cut himself lol
I wonder if his sending it back to apple and replacing it with apple care 😂
iFixit has a better video. It's stupid to destroy things and pollute the environment for YT revenue.
An apple in a year make your vision Clear .......
Cracking glass without glass 😂
what a waste of slave labour
It hurts me to see these kinds of videos 🥺😭😭😭😭
I'm so used to "scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7" that I literally said with deeper grooves at level 7 after he said "scratches at level 3" 😂😂😂
We do have scheduled text messages 😂
Crazy how easy throwing away $3500 is
this hurt to watch
😎😃 13:23
The sounds make me shiver.
anyone plan on cutting the wire, and making a 13v charging bank?
Saw a video of a guy lightly hitting his AR headset against a plaster wall, and it left scratches. I knew something was weird. Or bad..
Love ❤❤❤
It just giving me deeper grove on my mind 😂😂😂😂😂 as it shows how poor I really am...😂😂😢
“Tears of loneliness” killed me.
Watching him destroy stuff u can’t buy at 3am keeps me sane
Oh my gosh!! I was prepared to quickly skip through this video thinking it was click bait. This was amazing!! Both for shock value and for getting to see the inner workings of  the cool tech.
Verizon messages technically has scheduled messages so I guess hes switching back to iphone lol.
All hail to jerry❤
Such an unlucky piece of tech... So carefully assembled & shipped only to be destroyed this way...
I’m tempted to send the video to someone who knows EVERYTHING about the product, but he probably already watched it
Were you expecting titanium?
YOU COULD'VE GAVE IT TO ME..
What's the point of the glass if it isn't durability? Wouldn't they save weight by doing it all in plastic. What an awful product.
I can’t watch this video 😭
بابا المجال بدون جدال 😉👌❤️
No worries. I wasn't ganna buy trashpple anyway. Thanks for the video!
THE YAPLEEE VISION PROOO
Jerry
Ente ponnanna 😂
Muzhutha kazhapp
$3500 for a plastic?????
wow 🔥
Overpriced bongo + plastic service for 300 $  - I just giggled and you guys are buying it? ow.. probably in 2 months there will be a version with glass oww just another 1000$.. so... I applaud every single 1 of you who bought it and are roaming the streets of the cities in this piece of crap while looking only in 3 websites .. Amazing.. What I trully applaud is apple company. They made things which lambs buy which are overpriced for the quality of materials and stuff you get, but from thier perpective? My god this is pure gold. Salute for the milking people so efficiently!
When is samsungs coming out
Company that makes all this in nonwerable fashion will rule them all
Why on earth would you put the lamination on the outside of the glass....
I can't help but notice the black tape around your thumb Zack. I hope you did't hurt your thumb with the knife. Keep up the good work. ❤
The most unlucky apple vision pro😢
5:46 Tears of loneliness 🫥
ich finde deine familie
But the glass is under the plastic haha. Guessing it a bit of a click bait title
That last ironic and brutally honest simulation of using the device completely destroyed was brilliant!! Now I know what to do and not to do with the freaking “glasses”.  Thanks you!
Out of the many years i have watched this channel.. this has possibly been the hardest to watch 😂😢
I love it jerry ❤️💐
WHAAAT? no way? apple quality is mediocre? :O i am baffled and unfathomably shook by this
I can’t wait to see all the accident videos from this stupid headset.
This was a painful tear down 😢
How does it stack up to the Q3? I've heard some very disappointing things from long time VR users.. In that yes the screens are oleds, and yes it has eye tracking, but other than that it's pretty much equal. Which considering the price difference is well, not great for apple if that's true
My heart is too small to bear it
5:47 Tears of lonliness !! 🤣🤣
OMG I guess you know you're doing good when you can destroy stuff!!  Strangely enough satisfying watching you do this though...
I love this product, but as will all first gen tech, you best off waiting till second or third gen at least for cheaper and better quality. Love this review, good work
I wanna see a video where you reassemble it and it works :D
So satisfying🥹
Why are you surprised it’s plastic?
Next video idea. Identifying the 1000 grandma's who knitted my apple vision pro 😁😂
Gotta hate apple EVERYTHING CHEAP OVERATED PLASTIC
NGL   this is killing me slowly!!
Uhhh, Is there any way that I can get the two displays?
This Guy casually playing X and O on stuff that you can't afford
Vision pro : "Where am I shipped to?"  Apple : "Jarry rig everything"  Vision pro : "F*$k"
I felt more pain than the Apple vision pro itself.
Would it not have been better to give that 3k to charity.
Jerry do actually rig everything
Steve Jobs crying in the corner of heaven....😢
Watching him destroy stuff u can’t buy at 3am keeps me sane
I have been waiting for this!
eh for the price id expect an aluminum shell at the least
Visibly cringing at this video
I thought you see the outside of the Apple vision pro is real and its just glass, but when saw this video i figured out its filming outside to shoe into the Apple vision pro
5:40 while he was removing the fluffy plastic cover, I was feeling stressed and uncomfortable 🥵
Tears of loneliness  🤣😂
Thanks Zach. I'll wait for the $500 version VI that has more capabilities and gorilla glass.
5: 46  Tears of loneliness 😂
HOPE I get a D-BRAND CASE for my vision pro 😆
You didn’t check the speakers
Absolutely love this destruction but please wear a mask when you burn plastic bro, don't breathe the fumes
Lol very cheap material for $3500
Hell yeah 🤝🏻
When durability test for new ROG Phone? Im curious if the recent changes in its build make it again vulnerable.
tears of loneliness🤣🤣
Not an apple fan, but the level of engineering making it look like a bio mechanic thing, considering this device will stay on your skin is at highest level.
$3500 for plastic.  😂
"Tears of loneliness" 😂😂😂
If it was glass it’d be heavy as hell
Bro, I haven't eaten in two weeks, you're burning $3,500... :(
ASS. Always simp for Samsung.
Jeesuz this was painful to watch
Crazy this guy is ripping a 3500 dollar device just for us to see the inside in the middle of the night 😂

10:03 Zack loves his subscribers....
Such an unlucky vision pro, it's peers are being handled with newborn level care. And 2 hrs after unboxing it tht happened. Such a fun vid as alwys Zack.
“Tears of loneliness” 😂😂😂🥶🥶
$3k for a device that's not made to be repaired
The amount of tech packaged into this thing is wild.
Tears of loneliness got me
why do I find this large expenditure of money for the sake of technology and deep dive into machine part depths so satisfying? love the videos
hitman
The Vision Pro already looks so heavy, if they use glass on the front, it’d be completely unusable
what about for people wearing spectacles??
I was waiting for this video ❤
Apple is going to make more money on repairs for these than the GDP of a small country!  Say what you will about Apple but their business tactics are god tier.
What about falling 2 metres?
Imali smo na tiktoku prvi droptest i odmah je pukao
Awesome tech but I'm amazed the most that iMessage doesn't support scheduling text send out, that's ridiculous
Bro did you JerryRigKnife your thumb?
I was really interested in the vision pro until you pointed out the click is those two fingers - with my arthritis, I often can't bend my fingers much. Fun video as always!
Iphone breaking is funny but when it comes to Vision Pro is kinda painful
I could off had thT
The bands are hand knitted by ants, but they are special ants costing upwards of $1k just for one colony. They also spent 20k on training each colony. This is to eliminate the need for humans and computers, to make apple products more eco friendly.
I think theirs a lacquer coating on the glass front face.
not all that much different then my quest3 and i can play tons of games on my quest unlike the vision i can walk around and pretend i'm in a augmented world slightly less quility in passthrough but decent enough that i would be fine not to mention the quest 3 is about a quarter the price that a vision is.   have you did a test on the quest 3?
....."tears of loneliness"......🤣☠
Im still here waiting 1 day Jerry tear down Tesla😂
Those smartphone was on Jerry hands was nothing😂
Apples doing their usual overadvertising "unique and innovating" technology as something futuristic for 3500$ and people are eating it up when the meta quest 3 is 500$ has actual glass lenses and plays vr games instead of being promised upcoming games in a future update which will probably consist of dumb ipad apps that apples had for the last 20 years 🤦‍♂️
Get a hammer and nail next!
If Apple is planning to produce this gadget for 1 million units, they should make it 1 million and ONE units. An extra for Jerry to destroy. 😆
Ok, I love it 😅
11:31 Cyberpunk 2077 mod unlocked 🤣
This guy destroys everything for us to know what gadgets are the best!
For almosk $4k a piece this thing should be indestructible, make of Nokia 3310 bricks or something, not of some lazy plastic from someone's kid's toys. The biggest ripoff yet and not the last one that's for sure. Big corpo heads are sitting on thrones in their high castles and laughing their asses off because there will always be a bunch of fanboys who will pay any price for any crap with apple logo on it just to prove their status. 🤣  Great video though. Always fun to watch your meticulous approach to destruction 😅
Oga Jerry!!!! 😮 why you dey spoil am na
would be neat if it wasnt on ios. Why anyone would buy a computer that they refuse to give you admin access over is just ignorance... in the name of safety you arnt allowed to be free... sounds great doesnt it.
You are awesome!  I'll give my first like on a youtube episode ever just because of you!  Absolutely love that within minutes you are knifing up a 3g$ device just because.  Damn, you are great and this is awesome!  Going to love this video.  Thank you!  As boys we never get tired of destroying stuff just see how things work.
Cutting Edge!
You are bleeding man be careful
How fascinating Jerry gets his then rig everything... interesting 🤔🤔
for something that costs $3500 it sure does scream "cheaply made piece of shit" definitely gonna stick with an oculus
Cloth is cloth and they catch fire 😂
It's a shame it's a flop....oh wow no one cares
A $15 cut on the thumb, or $3500 cut?
$3500 down the drain
There is screen protector
Destroys apple product and advertises anker product... lol
Imagine a combination with neuralink
"Make-up, Sweat and Tears of loneliness" cut deeper than your Jerry Rig Blade ever could 🙂 LOL!
You just ascended on the Apple watchlist
I will loss my sleep next 1 week because of this,
This is giving me second hand stress
it's made as cheap as possible and sold as high as possible... I'm happy to see someone destroy an apple product!
I can't stand watching this, my anxiety kicks-in that the reality slap me when he started scratching it. My wallet is screaming out loud - "You poor peasant!" :D
Thanks for your content man🦾
Que loucura é essa ?
Another viral video from him😂 he's increasing his popularity by degrading Apple's
I see Jerry, clicked the title and liked the video right away before even watching the vid.
There's no fixing this even with apple care
Feels like it's been knitted with the love of thousand grandmas 🤣🤣
TheHitmanRigEverything
This thing looks and feels like a cheap 50 bucks reading aid
If it's not a rectangle, somehow the tests do not seem to make any sense.. weird 😢
Imagine the person who built  vision pro watching this video 💀
Who needs drugs when you have this to consume you
I have a lazy eye and I've always wondered if these things would work for me. Never could really watch 3d. Was wondering if it would be similar
Deberías invertir piernas ortopédicas para los minusvalías sería genial
Jerry should be in the Guinness book for having the most painful channel to watch on youtube
Love the Ready Player One reference 😅
Ouch
It’s Apple what do you expect they cheap out on everything
this pains me to watch this
I've always wanted to ask this since I was a kid... does someone get tremendously uncomfortable with the sound in 10:07 + ?
This thing is gloriously useless and reviewers are trying so hard to justify it. This is a less capable, overpowered Oculus Quest which cant run any relevant VR application at all. You cant even watch youtube or netflix on it. No one will use the see through feature, no one will use the recording feature, no one will facetime anyone with this and not many people will actually buy this thing.
Cringe...😮... can't even get one here in the UK, i 😢 cried. But $3500, that's madness! Love my Quest 3, it's probably not a huge world apart for 15% of Apple's gizmo.
This is easily the most uncomfortable I've ever been while watching your durability tests. I feel like I need a cigarette after this even though I don't smoke.
This amazing device is specifically designed to prevent your eyes from burning when you cut onions. It provides excellent protection and ensures that you can chop onions without shedding a tear.
The only video jerry disamble stuff and unable to assemble it back.. coz apple
Dude u have to carefully use this like a newly born baby
Him using the level 9 pick and watching the glass spider web was so satisfying.
If you're here for a teardown - better watch the one from ifixit. One thing is to check marketing claims or repairability or phone durability and the complete opposite is just destroying the whole thing. I believe there is no sane person would do a burn test of a knit band? What is the next test - burn test of a polishing cloth? What's the point? To prove that polymers burn? Or did u expected it's intended for fire squad? Neither this whole thing should be as sturdy as a phone, unless u have Alzheimers and ur hands work kinda like a shaker.
made in china 😂 design made in US
put it back together.  see if it turns on, jerry. :)
The epitome of instrinsic and planned obsolescence.
This teardown put tears in my eyes.  Awesome work as always .
My God, I'm a big fan of your work that are very instructive facts about technology. You are direct in terms of advancement. You literally destroy to see how advanced the equipment was, but you doing this with Apple's glasses. It was too much. If I had money, I would buy such glasses for me.
Apple has 2.1M views after two weeks and you got 3.4M on the first day 🔥
is it torture video for vision pro
Disgusting to see a device destroyed like that.
Is it possible? With 32*27mm * 2 It would mean one pixel is taking roughly 54 nm^2 so square of 7.3nm x 7.3nm. Can you really squeeze RGB pixel into such area?
Welcome to 2015 . Samsung gearvr does the same thing. 😅😅😅😅
4:20 Shi- I cringed
Wtf man😮
This pains me
Id rather buy myself a second 3090 a vr headset a new Camera, a new phone, a Pimax and a Tv than that thing
i don't particularly love the vision pro but boy.... my eyes and hearth are crying...
Destroyer. 😡
People are stupid enough to spend over 3000 dollars for this crap.. I don't understand anyway why so many people buy all these overpriced apple products
pain .. so much pain
“We start seeing scratches at level 3, deeper grooves at level 4” Amazing, astonishing, nothing can describe the perfection of the sentence!
I think they actually do think of repairability first they begin with making it impossible to repair
I can smell the smoke it costs 300bucks!
Now Rig that battery 🔋
I can schedule messages on iPhone
nunggu episode gadgetin review ini di barang aneh
I bet the apple vision pro team did not see this coming
Nothing I love more than planned obsolescence at a high price. And a close second is proprietary connections that look like a lightning connector but 2x the size and fits nothing else because the consumers mean nothing when you can instead stick it to the EU. Also can't wait for the new Mac books with this connector at a $200 price increase over last generation for their "all new innovative product called pro low latency" but don't sweat it our new Mac books have 5% more recycled aluminum to offset the E-waist we are creating with those new proprietary cables you can get for $60. I'll take 2... Maybe 3 just in case...
Please don't buy early and I might be dangerous
I feel like you're paying 3500 solely for the experience. The materials used for this are definitely not worth 3500 dollars. 😅
😂😂
Finally a real test for this extremely overpriced thing! I think they did cheap out on front glass and display lenses making them cheap plastic that is too easy to damage. So for a price of a big MacBook you have cheap(from materials standpoint) thing on m2 chip that will not serve you for long.
How could you.
LMAO
i see a beautifully engineered VR uncentered headset
Hard to watch
Samsung vr headset: meh its good Appe vr headset: *hoky mother of god this is beautiful*
For me, as a Windows guy, this video was extremely satisfying.
The face of Zack is so weired when toughing the vision pro at the end 😂❤
ASMR
What exactly is the glass for? Why not make it an easily replaceable plastic? It's not scratch-resistant, but extremely expensive to replace, so it looks like it's there to attract scratches for extra profit.
The only pro in this vision is the pro scratches it gets
FYI apple actually does have schedules text messages lol
😂😂😂😂كسرها وكسر قلبي معها
The joy in my face when i was watching this,i felt like a child who just got his 1st bicycle. Thanks zach
Try the quest 3 think it has glass glass on cameras an lenses
🥽Remember, Jeffrey forgot to turn on the camera before Be gentle with the Apple Vision Pro🥽
Nice touch with the double blink for access for someone with tetraplegia. Fairly easy software addition.
I’m curious how much will it cost to fix that damage
भाई इतना महंगा प्रोडक्ट बर्बाद कर दिया इतना तो भारत में किसी गरीब की 3 साल की कमाई होती इसने 12 में में बर्बाद कर दिया😢
Jerry didn't rig the portable battery 😢
noice snorkle.
When  are you fully taking apart the battery pack? Is there a circuit in there? Is there some heat dissipation tech?
I was blowing to my phone when the flame get bigger!! 😅😅😅
Could you, please, try to measure the focal length of the massive inner lenses?
U say...Tears of LONELINESS?? 🥲🥲
That scratching gave me goosebumps every time
4 grand & the headband isn’t fireproof? What if I’m wearing the headset & the headrest on my chair catches fire? I’ll pass on this thanks.
Thank you for your time invested in disassembling this ultra expensive and unrepairable device. It seems Apple is VERY keen on recouping R&D costs.
Fandroids: Apple doesn't innovate. Apple: Innovates Fandroids: This thing is surely gonna flop, it's going to be a biggest tech disaster.  Haters will never be pleased.
Wrench From WD2 vibes✨
Great video but the Grammar Police called to inform you that you forgot an apostrophe. “It’s Plastic” ❤️👍🏻❤️
That was almost painful to watch initially.  Then I really got into the deconstruction/destruction.  Nice Work!!! 🤘
This is very painful to watch!
"Tears of loneliness" 🤣
I sad to see that you destroyed my one year salary.
I swear this guy's voice has changed over the years
ive never felt so much pain with each blade scratch
Tears of loneliness 😂
Vision Pro.. death 👻
I find it very dumb that we will see walking with this thing in their heads.
Subscribed❤
The tears of loneliness got to me... 😆🤣😂
This is so hard to watch. I have never winced so much watching a youtube video.
i usually buy apple products cant i really really hate this. its like a vr headset but worse. any headset can do the same thing and people love this because apple made it. oculus quest 1 had been doing it and improving it. even still people flexing this useless device is just cringey and obnoxious.
Unboxing karne ka tarika thoda casual hai 😂
I'm not a fan of apple but you can't hate on them for this it's a pretty cool and well put together piece of tech
Ok he destroyed 3500$
This should be illegal
Why do so many content creators try soooo hard to have this ridiculous type of voice
r/HardwareGore basically
If tech gears have life, this man will be their ultimate fear.
Please tell me how many dislikes you got?
3500 USD for scratchable plastic. Wtf
waiting for this video
$3500  is not designed to be repaired   smh
6:05 that’s why it’s called teardown
Om tansen iklinyik
Jerry, you're one of a kind tech reviewer  I love ur content.
best video 2024 yet
a quest 3 for 6x the price! Bargain!
Am I the only one who thinks it's funny that Jerry's hand should be declared as the unit of measurement for the pressure needed when scratching glass, ranging from levels 1 to 8?
And he does it  😂
guy is the real hitman for phones and tech products
Comparing Apples repairability to wheres waldo is pretty perfect XD i must say the lens assembly looks pretty awesome also "Tears of loneliness" lol
This is pretty cool piece of tech
Jesus loves you
Who was trying to blow out the smoke and fire?
This guy is Destroying our Dream Products 💔💔
Did Jerry just burn the love of a 1000 grandmas
"Tears of loneliness."
why?
😂😂😂😂😂 Knitted by the love of a 1000 Grandma's
die Zukunft ist schon so nah, um ehrlich zu sein, ich dachte, wir müssten noch 100 Jahre warten..
I have goosies
The joy in my face when i was watching this,i felt like a child who just got his 1st bicycle😊😊. Thanks zach
I wish it was $800
Zach's not so subtle diggs are always a treat but I do appreciate the honestly and giving credit where it's due!!!
Deeper gr00ves
Tears of loneliness😅
For such price it should be made of titanium instead of heavyass aluminum. How much it weights? 🤷
plastic glas is always a good idea on something you have to wear..... like wtf this makes the whole product useless to the bones. one small scratch on your inner lense and that´s it.  3500Dollar go again.
I hope you're going to give that AVP away to a lucky subscriber
It rocked his own socks he wanted to destroy it😭 yea but good video
This is an interesting teardown. From the outside it makes sense to have this laminated glass, just to reduce the overall weight, but inside lenses being the same material, which is highly prone to scratches - that's a dangerous game to play and I'm not sure the most practical of options. I won't deny the fact, that this does look like a feat of engineering from one side and from the other you have dumb solution like a battery pack, that sits in your pocket. Another thing, because nobody talks about it, I wonder how hot this thing gets and how loud the fans are operating? As a basic premise - okay, but as a previous VR user - this still feels like a chore to use. My thinking is, that VR will take off the moment technology will allow it to be used as simply and effortlessly as putting the glasses on, so we have possibly about a decade for that? Especially with batteries: batteries with sodium won't do much, as this seems to be another step, but nano batteries with tungsten and graphite materials offering possibly much more efficient energy storage. So to me as of now all those VR headsets are an expensive gimmick, that are fun to try, but nowhere near being long time use devices, for the simple fact of lack of software support and overall comfort.
"casually sets it on fire"
Sometimes I just know I might never get the chance to use a gadget like this
😅😅😅😅
Ohhhhh
Hey Jerry are the tech you test on sponsered or bought from your own money?
Can I have it please
Bro is 3 am
I mean I get it for the front plastic... But the inside too??!
I think Jerry should've watched the ifix it teardown first before butchering Apple's baby 😢 😂😂😂
I thought @JerryRigEverything would be the last man on Earth to do this to the AVP.
Incredible channel. Very informative and entertaining. Thanks!
As someone who uses mostly apple products, this is some bs. Plastic everywhere for a $3500 headset 7x more expensive than the quest 3. I get it’s also its own computer, but for 3500 this could have at least been glass on the inside lenses.
😱 to think a guy was driving a Tesla wearing one 😬 there’s nothing  translucent at all!! it’s a blindfold all along then
Imagine not having pressed the record button
I didnt know i was well adjusted enough to get through the video without curling in on myself.
Bro uJust freaking murdered it :(
Man those scratches!!!!!  That hit straight into the heart man.
Did you cut your thumb?????
Seeing him destroy 3.5k for everyone's satisfaction is just pure love <3.
meta owners cried seeing this, apple was really waiting for momentum and this is the time
Are you saying JRE or Jerry with a Polish accent? We'll never know
Does it hurt your eyes
3,500 bucks worth of crap designed to extort from you a lot more than that. No thanks.
great video, but your hands are really dirty
It hurts watching you slice into something that expensive. But it's informative so thanks.
That head strap didn’t take long to burn! You would’ve thought it’d be made from a more fire resistant material given the price point? 😱
OMG 😱 you are crazy 😅
who is paying 3500 for that smh
Honestly, seeing these destructive reviews can actually help with the durability of future models. Though that would likely up the pricing even more.  And also helps people like me find ways to upgrade second-hand models
😅 11:27 accessible to people with physical impairments like the physical impairment of being poor?
Vision pro is first gen of the somthing special that apple try something new over a decade" 😂 OP
"Feels like it's been knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas" in the Jerry voice had me rolling
The channel initials are JRE And I just realized when you say it out loud It actually sounds like you're just saying "Jerry" with a Polish accent
The scrape on the metal part genuinely hurt tho
I still wanna see level 9
Amazing video! FYI, there is accessibility navigation options for the Vision Pro. There’s a function where you can gaze at an item for a few seconds and it will select it for you. Also, if you don’t have fingers or hands I’m pretty sure the device can track your limbs. Along with voice control! I’m unaware of the other accessibility features, but I’m sure there’s some other things like voiceover.  Hoping they release a physical controller for accessibility at some point.
instead of breaking it into pieces, why don't you just visit the factory and ask permission to record the making process? you can't do that can you ? your ability to do that maybe measured -100000000xxxxxx huh? you can use the money to share it with the homeless, don't you know that???
You shall rename the title from "Plastic" to "Pathetic"!!! At least, they could have provided scratch resistant coating on the glasses, which won't cost billions!!!!
Zack actively burning love of 1000 grandmas 😂
Love how this vid’s intro is the outro of the S24U teardown. It’s like I’m watching a JerryRig Series
That should buff right out.
A $3,500 for a non scratch resistant product, that's bullshit!!!!! What if it gets scratched and ruins your whole experience?!! Who the idiot is going to buy such things?!!! Apple is insane!!! They think their customers are foolish and real idiots!!!! Are we?!! How the hell can they give such a pathetic quality product for such price?!!! Common guys!!!! We are promoting this brand like idiots and they have concluded that we are!!! We have to teach them something!!! Otherwise, their game continues!!
It is so heavy it will destroy people’s faces after some time. He is just pretending it’s not heavy. ‘Cause people will need a facelift after wearing this for a couple of months 😅
So we took unboxing to a deeper level. Quite satisfying... he he.
I would say your warranty is void good Sir. Nice to see it destroyed. I'm not an Apple fan.😂
lezz gooooo
Apple logic: Pay for product, purchase their insurance, product gets damaged, consumer wants to use overpriced insurance, customer gets charged a fee for using already overpriced insurance.
Every detailed are extremely amazing
It lasts TWO HOURS?!
Tks 47
the inside of hat thing really was beautiful
As interesting as this is, I literally CANNOT listen to metal scractching over Aluminum surfaces - I just instinctively rip my headphones away from my eary to prevent acoustic meltdown...
I was finally able to see a 9 level test. Today is a good day
Watching this on my iphone was not a probl
You blame scientific people who work hard and invent technology and things like that... and you what...? You are wasting your money on trivial things. I feel angry with you because there are children dying of hunger and you are buying inventions and sabotaging them....! Damn this trivial and unfair world 😑
Bunker video ???????
I wonder how heavy that outer aluminum frame is?  This is a very heavy VR headset - if that’s something like 100-150 grams then if they’d have swapped that out for polycarbonate this thing would be far lighter.
this guy gonna buy apple building next time
Dude , there are millions of ideas better than wasting your money on trivial matters like this. In the end, we remain human....? Humans cannot make something that lasts forever
Now open the battery
You might consider re-keying any locks that use the Better Home Products key you showed while doing the tear down. It is quite easy to decode the BHP key shown in your video and then cut a replica.
Now send this for warranty
Damn dude totally killed this unit
Tears of loneliness 😂😂
From a computer the size of a building,to a computer on your face😅
"... the moisture, makeup, sweat, and tears of loneliness." Math checks out.
10:03 goosebumps and feel satisfied 😂😂😂❤
this was the first painful tear down for me
I feel a lot satisfied after watching his videos destroying expensive things that I can't afford 😅
Definitely will lead to some impressive leaps in more portable vr. It would be really nice to see this sort of technology used for spinal impaired people and others with impairments
Pure satisfaction 10:09
Weird that you call yourself Jerry in your thoughts
When I watch this I picture a few guys at Apple headquarters watching this with their hands on their hips... 🤭
I have a high spinal cord injury and yes accessibility for no or limited hand use matters.  Thanks for pointing it out
oh to be this rich just to destroy a $3500 tech😭
I will not be able to afford this piece of tech for 2024 for sure, yet I respect all the work that went into creating it!!👍🏽👍🏽, so you can imagine my pain looking at you s-l-o-w-l-y !! destroy it. yet i cannot look away, great video👍🏽👍🏽🥺🤣
Laminated glass sure does the job
The Apple care math tho...
So funny seeing you destroy 4000$ worth of glasses
plastic lenses flammable bands overpriced poor integration with either MacOS, iOS or windows lack of privacy beacons on either MacOS, iOS or android Did apple learn nothing from Google glass? This is garbage for 2023. I guess we're waiting til 2026 for real hardware. Zero repairability Pointless POV features Apple and Telsa what the hell is happening in California lately..... There are going to be some seriously superior glasses coming don't waste your money. Tim Cook is losing the company lately. and Sorry Jerry but seriously for those of us who've been using HTC, Microsoft Hololens prototypes, various VR hardware and Rayban AR, its quite clear, 'reality' is not a relevant measure here. The resolution nor the comfort is significantly superior. Please don't fall into the 'must not say too much bad stuff about Apple or they won't send me review devices or will denounce my reviews' trap like so many Tesla car reviewers. Cmon. 12ms is not impressive and calling your chips M1,M2,M3 and 'R1' is rubbish. We do NOT need nonsense marketing clip terms applied to CPUs. This not the first time Apple have tried AR. Prototypes have been happening since 2019. I really like your videos but this is WAY too positive for no sig reason. You HAVE been testing AR stuff since 2018 right? I Mean...? Calling yet another revision of effectively OS X something new like Vision OS with its own app store. I mean ...this is so insanely lame. Apple are going to get absolutely smashed in the AR space despite Swift and various toolsets being great. They don't get it - hardware matters. Not f*ng celebrity endorsement events. Tim Cook should go run a music company instead. He really has lost the plot and Apple are following a trajectory of assumption and very minor evolution just like when Jobs was no longer present the first time. This stuff matters and every year Apple are falling behind. Not to mention Telsa are too. BYD and Chinese hardware are coming. And I'm not supportive of this necessarily but this is a joke its been 5 YEARS since I first tried an Apple early prototype and this looks almost no different. The separate CPU name, OS name, app store name, does Apple just think they can keep duplicating infra on each new platform? Its a joke. Start the end people. Stop whitewashing Apple. This is NOT acceptable in 2023/2024 for the price. You wanna wear this walking around the city? That is what AR is going to do. Not this BS. 3/10
This is so hard to watch 😭
Nice pwr bank
It actually looks less dorky than I imagined
Yeyyy!!!!😄😁😄
Wow lol 3k wasted lol
This thing is so amazing Jerry momentarily became an Apple fanboy.
I could not do your job. Even if money was no object, I could not destroy a $3,500 product!
I wonder how many times you've been the first consumer to destroy a product after it launches
3500 is wild, the purpose of tech to keep advancing, is to make life easier. 3500 isn't easy for the average Joe
13:25 😶‍🌫️
6:41 i guess box cuter 1- 0 Jerry
You are awesome!  I'll give my first like on a youtube episode ever just because of you!  Absolutely love that within minutes you are knifing up a 3g$ device just because.  Damn, you are great and this is awesome!  Going to love this video.  Thank you!  As boys we never get tired of destroying stuff just see how things work.
Something to keep in mind with Vision Pro is that despite its durability "issues", you're very rarely going to have it in a position where it can get damaged. It's strapped to your head so it's unlikely to get dropped or scratched in the first place.
3500$. God bless.
I imagine @Plainrock124 might use this video for some ideas on how to destroy the vision pro.
The love of a thousand grandmas 😂😂😂
Great comment about accessibility options and very insightful to suggest the wrist extension for higher level SCI. ESP since they could really benefit from using this technology. I wasn’t aware you had a company that made wheelchairs. Very cool
Hey Jerry, at 10:04 when you started to scratch the inner lens I lost it. Sounded like a happy lama 😂😂😂😂😂😂
3500 for that is not worth it
I am not an apple product user and I really like Zach's videos but knowing that this thing costs $3500. This video did hurt a little.
Lol jerry made close to $40k for this video so far.  3500. I think he can afford it. Lol
I see why Apple is making a ton load of money. All tech youtubers buying multiple to flex haha
That last shot 😂😂
“Feels like it’s been knitted with the love of 1000 grandma’s” 😂😂😂
Waiting for this video. Awesome teardown as always!
This is honestly so cool
I know It's a bit too late but a Sim card ejector tool releases the side straps from main housing. You can see the tiny holes where the straps meet the goggles.
CAN U TEST IF ITS STILL GOING TO WORK? lol
Appple ceo watching from the corner 😂😂😂😂😂😂 whattttt😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Watching this have convinced me this product sucks. Exterior AND interior lenses can be scratched by almost anything, the rear head band being flammable might not bother most people, but that isn't good in my eyes.   This should be max $800 if they're cutting corners like this
🤣🤣🤣🤣
why jerry why wahts wrong with you
I do really appreciate that you made this video. I would love one of these but I’m not even gonna consider it until they make one for under $1000.
Why is this video so addicting to watch yet so hard at the same time
I CANT WATCH
just buy the quest 3
I genuinely think reparability isn't a thought aside from Apple doing it with this first gen product
😂
Knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas 😮
Por favor volte a dublar os vídeos em português brasileiro
Apple probably dreads your video releases now
Brooo that hurt😢
$3500 wasted😂
$3500 wasted😂
I dunno if anyone’s said it yet, but Apple KIND OF has scheduled text messages in a really DIY kind of way. It’s in the shortcuts app, and you can set up an automation to do a scheduled text that way. It’s not the most intuitive thing ever or even like advertised at all, but it is most definitely there
Iphone does have scheduled messages. It can be accessed via shortcuts 🙂
Bro that’s hurt me😢
I laughed so hard at the end hahahahahahahahah wtfff
Its awesome technology ruined by Apple's greed.
"the oasis"   -read player one reference
Holy lag, YouTube is seriously slowing this website down if you have ad blocks
How could you not open battery 😭😭
jerry has no chill.   he didnt at least boot up the thing😂 Gadaymmm
Sir dubbing for Hindi language
yeah right.. $3500 piece of plastic.  never gonna happen.
Imagine recording this entire video only to realize the overhead can never recorded.
His headstone is going to say scratches at a level three and deeper grooves at a level four.
uh oh
I am so disappointed with products scratching. The only thing I have been impressed with is my Apple Watch Ultra. It is still scratch free after lots of hits on metal. I bought a very expensive "Sapphire" screen protector for my iPhone and even it has been scratched by my aluminum Oura ring.
Finally satisfying my mind 😅
The Oasis!!😆😆👍
How do you manage such a huge e-waste after your tear downs?
Do redmagic 9 pro breakdown
Now we feel secure 😆
This is not a teardown. this is a tearing apart 😅
This pissed me off, ngl But it's not this guy's fault, it's the ones who put that abomination together
@JerryRigEverything how about the Microsoft HoloLens?
Holy smokee..
the fact this is #7 on trending
watching this made me cry. i’ve been wanting one so bad but can’t afford it 😰
I thought it was gonna scratch at lvl 5😂
As a non apple user this still hurts to watch
Vision pro got deeper grooves at level 3 so did Zac's right thumb  6:41
😂 why do you mock man! Why?!😂
Geez, let's hope you never start to stress test animals.
If there's thermal paste, then it's impossible to replace lmao😂
I can't believe 11 years passed watching zac's videos, from actual repairing phones with the correct tools to catastrophic blades phone durability tests and purchasing expensive phones.
RIP Apple Vision
Watching you cut towards an already bandaged thumb is....
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 that was some great production ! Humorous 2 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
This has got to be one of the stupidest reviews I’ve ever seen. Surprise, if you attack it with a box cutter you can scratch it and try to ignite it with a flame it will slowly burn. Wow, what are you going to tell me next? Water is wet and the sky is blue?
Great review
Can't beat my Holo-lens....  I can virtually walk through my architectural designs while sitting at my desk.
Apple wants to talk to you
No matter how many videos i watch, i skip the scratch test on the metal ... its like nails on a chalk board 😅😅
I hate u for doing this jerry😢😅
I really hope that it goes down in price this could be really good for programming because you can program anywhere ... i hope
Hmm why are there just Croatian captions 🤔
not sure you'll be invited at their Party in their HQ :D  well done !
Schedule texts messages! Awesome! Thanks for the tip.
😪😪
That razor blade scratching the medal makes my teeth hurt.
damn
These videos will never cease to trigger me.        I will also never cease to watch them.
🙀🙀🙀
Maybe they will release the “Apple  i-Cleaner” in September!  😅
My heart broke watching this video.  Every scratch, tear, cut and burn was a dagger in my heart.  😢💔😔   😂😂😂
I like seeing you break down electronics but I love your soothing voice, that’s the best part of the video.
finally 3D 8k Tantakle 😮
Wow
Zack’s quips throughout his videos are unlike anyone else 😂 I’m totally on board with more accessibility options (11:32) but the hand motion performed used to trigger a command can’t overlap with a natural movement, otherwise the amount of accidental clicks will be infuriating
I’m so glad he did this, I’m so pissed that they way over priced this dumb thing. If I’m paying thousands of dollars for a head set I wanna pay to use it not to have it sit there to look pretty
These videos kill me from the inside, knowing that this expensive peace of hardware is being destroyed makes me anxious.
I’ve been waiting for this moment since Vision Pro was released
All I seen was this dude quite intentionally breaking the device and then talking about it haha.
From FreeBSD's Fortune archive: Van Roy's Law: An unbreakable toy is useful for breaking other toys. *Zack's toys are brutal*
Samsung: scratches at level 7 with deeper groves at level 8 Apple: scratches at level 3 with deeper groves at level 4
JerryRigEverything❎ JerrySlaughterhouse✅
So painful to watch lmao
A2D
Do you think perhaps they screwed up and got the laminated glass the wrong way around? I thought Gorilla Glass would've made more sense.
Apple RIPPING OFF people's money for over a decade now. As technology is getting cheaper and affordable with time , Apple keeps on setting prices too high. For example: A computer in 90s was a luxury item. Now, everybody can have a computer. Then why Apple keep computers so expensive as the components are getting cheaper and better with time.
How are you people watching this disaster of a product and thinking "hmm yes, I would love to buy this slop because I'm addicted to brands"
Dudes fu*king up a $3500 headset like it’s nothing…
this is pissing me off
Most interesting video after long time
Damn😂😂😂😂😂
I love this!! You’re my anti-apple hero!! You are so brutal , apple ppl are screaming, laying on the floor crying right now hahahaha ! Sooooo gooood
you can schedule message with shortcut....
I can't finish watching this video, sorry...
That’s can’t be resistant glass it gonna be too heavy in your head probably your face…🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
What’s most irritating is that after all the shit Apple got for using lightning still, they decided to use it as the “hidden” proprietary cable.
Imagine he started framing the torn down items and putting it on the wall in the background
I AM LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY 😂😂😂 I AM LAUGHING SO SO HARD 😂😅
I did not expect it to burn so slow. Also don’t seem like it’s even worth 1k.
Most satisfying video
You make me relax knowing this thing I can’t buy but actually made of cheap plastic material
Eyepiece has to be covered in plastic for safety reason in case of accidents if glass will shatter into your eyes.
can you make a video of taking it to Apple Store and ask for repair. Oh I had a car crash.
For $3500 apple cant even put a more protectiver screen.....
"the rubber is there to keep.. tears of loneliness out of the motorized internals" DAMN i felt that one (im totally fine)
All of your personal electronic devices (laptops, cell phones, tablets etc.) emit Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR), or Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) that are comprised of Extremely Low Frequencies (ELF), Radio Frequencies (RF, Wi-fi, data etc.) and Thermal Radiation (heat), all of which are potentially harmful. Gamma Rays, X-Rays and UV are also types of EMR. I found my answer😅
Can you send me those Vision Pros I can’t afford that
2 really great ideas for accessibility, I hope apply find a way to implement them or something similar
I just want to find what level of radiation we acquire from that device in our face and head ?
Damn, $4000 destruction.
No way there was cooling system infront of that lens..this is an engineering marvel damn..
Nice))
The size of that board is crazy!
Can I, uhhh. Have it when you are done?
If I was him I would where gloves
why u cut like that? then dont cry when you hurt yourself
In Germany we say "Er hat nicht alle Tassen im Schrank" 😯
❤❤❤
I thought it was a transparent screen like LG or Samsung, it should be.
oof -3500, yeah, i'll never buy apple product
“before i do my thing” chilling words
why ur videos feel like wrong turn movies
I was going to say "oh the inside lens being plastic is okay, it's like the Quest!x But then I remembered its $3,500 and suddenly wasn't so okay with it
Watching jeri destroying Vision Pro  Now I know how dumb i am if i bought that with $3500  I hope my PC $500 more expensive than this 😂
Change your name to DamageEverything
Ayyy LTT screwdriver babyyyyy
You’re the richest YouTuber I can say. You just scratched that 3500 bro. Cheers
Clearly the Pro stands for Prototype
Its so expensive that every single scratch makes me d…
Can't wait these for these to come into my budget window in about 15 years
bro just wasted 4k dollars by destroying vision pro
The god damn battery cable makes me laugh every time 😂
Most modern electronics have transitioned to USB-C to include the iPhone 15, yet here we are Apple....
$3500 and it's made of plastic?  I meant "laminated glass".  Way to go, Apple.
Jerry started off dismantling things. Now he just pulls and tears them apart. I don’t see what we gain from him will fully tearing stuff apart and creating landfill. I wonder what this guys carbon footprint is? How will society judge him a decade from now?
Awesome
how can you see outside if there were fans in there
watching him destroy that is KILLING me why would he spend that much money js to use it for 2 hours like what
Apple CEO Watching This: 👁️👄👁️
when you have people who tell you that you dont have the right to share your opinion that irks me. simply saying that wasting $3,500 to prove something that no-one in their right mind would ever do is a waste of money. if zac has money to waste then its his money. however, (and i will explain), it isnt really his money he's wasting, but every person that views his videos. granted, he puts in far more time to produce one video than most of us work half a week for. that is probably an over exaggeration but you hopefully get the point. he does more work in one week that many of us do in 2 and i respect him for that. i just dont agree with someone wasting that much money in the first place! thats all i have to say on the subject!
ya know, the "it's plastic" is prob just meant for clickbait... but if no one knows, the quest 2 is way more plastic, and it's built like a tank... I haven't finished the video, I hope this doesn't break easily for 3500...
haha i feel you jerry at 6:30. $15 and a papercut
I hate it.😮
I mean tbf it makes sense. When not in use it should have the "sock" on so scratches shouldn't be common. Drops are much more common.
That is messed up 🤬
This is unparalleled. I had the privilege of reading something similar, and it was truly unparalleled. "Reclaiming Connection: The Journey of a Digital Detox" by Joshua Ember
Glad you did a break down. Seen like some of Apple claims may not be so true.
What a Satisfaction 😊
Overpriced like a MFr.
what a disaster it's just a thing of scamming people to buy because it's the future to see the shit.
New channel name. Jerry breaks everything 😂😂😂😂
I like your voice :)
Who's concentrating on what Jerry's saying when he's actually shattering every piece of $3500?
I was waiting for This vídeo!
This is so disrespectful to the people who spent years making that thing lmao
There's something about Zac's voice that's so relaxing that I only wince _slightly_ as I watch him destroy beautiful new hardware. Keep up the good work ❤
Could you maybe compare it to the quest 3?
What a cheap peice of crap for $3,500...
“My Patience is Inmeasurable”   Sounds like an Interrogation expert 💀
Zac performing the finger tap gestures after completely vandalizing the Apple Vision Pro is peak comedy
Looking forward to see a transparent version of the vision pro.
Can you package this back up and send it in for Apple Repair to see how well they do?
11:38 I think we all know why there's no wrist gesture 😂
Dude, simply put....you sir are a LEGEND!
Cringing while he destroys this almost 4 grand product. Give him slot of credit to destroy it for our pleasure and knowledge. Thx
Jerry will force apple to close eventually 😅, he always spot there lies 😂
Is it illegal to sell Jerryrig lighters?
I have to be honest these goggles looks like retro tech from the 90s. I'm glad you've tore down this horrible proprietary technology.. oof!
C'mon.. i'm joke to youu .. 😂
I've been waiting for this yess
LETSS GOOOOO
the plastic lenses are disappointing. it's reasonable enough on the outside, but on the inside ?
bad feeling in my stomach.. this is getting me nauseous.
iPhones have had scheduled text messages via shortcuts for over 5 years.
I feel like the highest possible price for Apple do to the glass repair would be worth $150. AT MOST $150. Cost for a new screen, cost of glass removal, cost of paying the worker who puts it back on. The rest (would be very little) would go company profits.
Looks like your thumb didn't survive this durability test.  Great tear down, always enjoy your videos!
Does Apple care cover acts of Jerry?
😂 4k thousand dollars and look how easy it is to strip 🥱🤷
Could I get this from you? I can cover shipping costs as well I have no reason I just want it and can’t afford it lmao
The inside reminds me of Ready Player One
In others words… you paying more for the software that the product….
To absorb tears of loneliness:)
Zach ripping the thing to shreads and explaining how it work while Apple designer and engineers are dying while watching this happen.
-5000 dollars
I feel like there's a business strat here to get more people to purchase Applecare. Clearly it would have made more sense to put the plastic inside the glass and to have it be easily removable. However, they didn't do that because more damage means more Applecare purchases 2:20
truly insane engineering. This must have taken 5 years of R&D
Scratching the aluminum reminds me back to someone scratching the blackboard. Sounds eeeck
Saw his cut thumb and instantly thought what device was he destroying when he cut himself 😂
"Feels like it's been knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas" in the Jerry voice had me rolling
scary how easily it scratches
The first time the durability-tested product might not be so easily covered by the sponsor and ad money.
$3500 for plastic junk
Jerry definitely gives off "diehard android user" vibes
How is bro not sued
I don't know why ii wasn't subscribed. But setting fire to an Apple product made me do it!
"not designed to be repaired"
Wealthy peoples product. Made with poor people materials lmao
Just stupid click bait.  He said the iphone 15 was able to be easily damaged.....yeah right;  mine's been through a bunch of falls and all kinds of hell yet still looks brand new.   Why you breaking expensive stuff?  What's your point other than to get paid (views)?
You know what puts me off it when you’re cleaning thermal paste off of where my eyes would go? I’m reminded of the Galaxy Note 7 faults and would I really trust that on my eyes?
you are the whistlindiesel of tech products. so fun seeing products getting destroyed
Softest fabric ever? Softer than Blåhaj?
Scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4? Wow what a great year, new scratch level every week
good job 47
this dudes voice puts me to sleep like omg so calming
Okay now this was dope. I’m so glad he can afford to do this for us haha
it's almost as if Apple knew EXACTLY what they were doing designing the lenses to be coated in easily scratched plastic. to sell more Apple Care subscriptions
Who ever makes a screen protector for this first is going to make bank
Now, put it back together! 😅
He must be rich to destroy an Apple Vision Pro like that I wish I can buy one but it’s so expensive 😅
Now all the hipsters will have cracked vision pro swag 😎
Why am I not surprised to see an apple proprietary connector on the battery pack
Хлам
I can feel those Anker power banks sweating as they are being handled on your table
The scratched front is honestly okay. It's not like it rly has any functions
Keep the good work 😂
Being an apple product, it would take a miracle to find screws without prying something off first
I’m apple “fan”, but I’ll never get a vision pro 😂😂
Dang that plastic is very much like my cheap eyeglasses I get online for about $40 a pair. I don't guess the Apple Vision pro is for movies and games nor for most people. Is that an executive toy?
So the front is a scratch magnet. Even though it houses the cameras and sensors the device needs to work the way it is supposed to. Wtf Apple.
This breakdown showed me why this thing is so expensive.
Apple has given up on their “REDUCE PLASTIC” with this product.
This is hard to watch 😅
Apple is for suckers
Peace of Junk
Tears of loneliness 😅😂😂
Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us.
Tear down skin???
Imagine integrating this with night vision and thermal imaging
I just love the fact that this guy is going to destroy you something that a lot of people just can't buy.
4:30 💀
You just got ripped off by apple cheap plastic could've made it out of hemp it would've lasted a lifetime
As a fellow glasses user, I agree that soft fabrics are the only way to clean glasses if you don’t want scratches
Now you to can help surveil your surroundings for big-tech, with a whopping array of cameras and microphones conveinintly connected to the interwebs, compete with face detection and more! help out the poor guys at apple to surveil every corner of the planet.
I lost it when he set it on fire 💀
Tim Cook is not happy 😂
Is it just me or does apple suck in every way possible. Even the software is stupid
You kidding me? After wearing glasses for almost 17 years, I just now realized that the reason I always get my glasses scratched insanely fast is because I use whatever to clean them, my shirt, paper towels, toilet paper etc etc. Welp, guess I learned something new today lol
Yes!! This the review we all waiting for. Show us the guts!!😂
Now, that is a unique review for sure :)
It probably hurts a lot of people to see something like that
6:32 we missed where jerryrig cut his thumb 👍....  i always feel uncomfortable with how he slices through screens with his knife.
Apple Laminated Glass, scam.
I Can't Buy This I Cant Repair This I Can't Afford This But Watching This 😂😂
Hahahaha the love of a thousand grandma. You gotta give the man monumental credit for the smart analogies he builds and the vocab he uses in his videos’s script. It wouldn’t be the same without that. You have that chill tone that sometimes goes ironic and sometimes is serious and you have to wonder which is which. That’s what makes me appreciate the channel all the more
Who needs a stress ball with this channel lol
should have done the quest 2 and 3 also
Honestly the part at the start about usb c is wrong, it couldve used usbc
I'm withe my money 😅
What a masacre. 😂
La verdad que estas pruebas en este producto no tienen sentido
This made me feel quite unwell.
Takes a new meaning to the word teardown lol
I have never and will never buy Apple's trash products, but Jesus, watching you scratch $3,500 of craftsmanship seriously aches me.
Damn! That aluminum scrape made me mute the video and cringe. Awful. Usually good with sounds but that's like nails on a chalkboard.
You could have given this to me as a charity. Wtf why did you have to tear it apart 😢
Make a teardown of the apple vision Powerbank
I’m here crying that I can’t afford to buy one, and seeing him getting paid to destroy them makes my life feeling miserable 😞
Honestly it would be really nice if he could put out a version of these videos without the harsh noise of him scratching things as loud. I get that it’s part of the appeal for many but it would be great to have an option.
Friend, don’t end up in Hell for eternity!  Turn from sin to Jesus. He came to save us from our sins and give us life. Turn before it is too late! Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus, it is the only hope we have. John 3v16
Vision pro tear down skin ???👀👀
I'm still waiting for the EU to yell: Why no USB-C on this one!
Expensive plastic
again how much is this ready player one prototype only to be... P L A S T I C  L E N T S...
Knowing apple employees cried watching you destroy this made me smile
bro your channel is BOOMING i remember watching you back in the day, when the new iphone 10 had come out and stuff like that, you're still ripping, 8.5 mil subs, and all your videos get more than 1 2 million views. well deserved man
I felt pain 10/10
This is super cool. Like cyberpunk tech goggles
Plastic🫤
I loved your feedback about accessibility. I hope someone at Apple sees this and takes that into consideration.
You should make a teardown skin for the front since the outside eye display doesnt work anyways
was he bleeding at the end in his right eye?
Worst noise known to man 4:20
applecare is worth it bc you can get more than one replacement and you are covered against almost anything else as compared to paying out of pocket
The VCR of 2024
Thats why i love jerry honest reviews ❤️
Imagine being the only apple vision pro sent to jerryrig 😢
I think testing to level 9 each time would be worth watching, since my heart shatters every time I see nice tech be destroyed anyway.
The good thing is that all damage is covered by the Apple warranty. Just send all the pieces in a box and you will receive a new one from the factory.😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅
This has to be one of the best ever JerryRigEverything videos, so satisfying and refreshing.  Kudos to Apple.
I hate how you tare stuff apart all the time.
Destroyed!  Level 3!
I'm disappointed you did not open the magnetically attached light shield, neither the speakers or the side bands. *I expected more carnage*
wait what ? 3500 ?
❤❤❤
Is it still works?
New to the channel and was hoping for more realistic tests like...dropping it or ramming into a wall...all of these are pretty extremes cases lol entertaining but not really helpful
My heart broke every time when I watched on this video. 😵😵😵😵Expensive experiment!
wait... should i buy this as snowboarding goggles????
0:07: There are pull tabs on that box!
The Apple Vision Pro has a vibe to it that makes me feel like I'm looking back at a first gen device.  Like, I can see where the concept will go with later iterations but it already feels outdated somehow
I'm only 3 minutes in and not sure I can continue. This hurts me.
My notifications: JRE scratches Apple vision Me: Of course, scratches at lvl 6... JRE: It scratches at level 3... Me: SAY WUT?!?
You should disassemble in a less destructive manner. Would have been cool to see the front display powered on after you reveled the inner workings
When is the next bunker update?
Nice video bro
Now put it back together 😂
They put glass under plastic to make it scratch easily to replace it for you for $ and glass to give you opportunity to also break it 🤑
When you have income from 8.3 million subscribers, you can probably blow up a Ferrari and not lose a wink of sleep.
I wish there was a love button and not just like 💌
You can schedule text messages on iphones
Jerry just did all the hard work for the Chinese!
That scratch sound was the apple engineering team squeaking in pain
apple in a nutshell
I'm pretty sure that it didn't need to be $3500.  Being "apple" probably added $2000 to the MSRP.  lol
Wow, you pay the equivalent of a car down payment and don't even get non-plastic parts.
Oh man that was hard to watch
idk why but it just feels so shitty knowing there are so many people out there who get money for destroying things most people wont ever be able to afford in their lives. fuck the wealth gap in this world.
Leaving an algorithmic comment so you can earn back the money you spent from the video 😎
Anker powerbank is just so cool 😮
This piece of crap cost $3,500!!!!!!!
I’ve waited for this video for so long 😭😭😭
Says it has recycled wool. _Proceeds to burn and smoke like plastic fabric_
*IT'S
I am so happy you are so successful, I really love your videos and the way you see tech. Just amazing Zack
The whole world is using wireless headphones and accessories to get rid of annoying cables, and apple sells us this crap that needs to be connected to a battery in your pocket. And on top of that they didn't even bother to make the front glass of some durable material, it's just some cheap scratchable crap. I would expect more from a 3500$ product.
I wonder how much it would cost without the outside display. It just seems super useless to me lol.
How did he put it back together?
Jonny Sins of electronics 👉👌
I'm not a huge Apple fan, but now...  ...now I don't like this unnecessary overpriced piece of crap either.
I have been saving for this thing and still can’t get my hands on it, and then this video comes out 😢
i cant beleve u distroyed a 3000 doler device that I can only dream of owing
3500 my ass it worth like 1000$
This was amazing ❤
It’s not plastic it has a plastic layer to make replacement easier just like your phone back
lol you totally wrecked that >$1,000 toy xD
This was cathartic.  Thank you for destroying any temptation to buying this and me scratching it on accident later.
Honestly this is a great opportunity for Anker. all they gotta do is make their power bank the lighting port plug thing but make it better so people dont have to use the 2 hour long one provided by apple.
Min 5:52 tears of loneliness   Ouch 🤕   The collective Apple community felt that TRUTH.   Indeed this n similar tech r purely a reflection of how lonely n secluded we have become
Please do a video where you show the difference between your scratch tools. I know like some phone scratches at a lvl 6&7 and that shit scratch at lvl 2. But we don’t know the difference in sharpness and material. Show it under a microscope or something. Thanks👍
Sat here blowing out the fire on the headband...
I definitely have to get a JerryRigEverything knife 🥺
Something about destroying £3500 headsets is painful... even if they're from Apple.
I was wondering when we will take a blow torch to this thing and find out what it is made off 😅
I have a high spinal cord injury and yes accessibility for no or limited hand use matters.  Thanks for pointing it out ❤
Love your videoes😊 Hoping to get one soon
Hey, be careful with that cutter, you might break it!
$3500 and the outside and inside glass elements are plastic is the soul reason I will not be getting one of these
now everyone is gonna believe apple vision pro is bad that’s just how the media works 🙄
This man is a bad ass  he destroyed the apple vision pro just to see how well the made it
I’ve been waiting for this the moment they announced it 👌🏼 and I’m not disappointed
Muito bom kkkkkkkkk
so apple admits its glass with plastic coating on their website and they still title it "ITS PLASTIC" to whore for views. U want non laminated glass on something that close to your face? Glass in your eyes?
LockPickingLawyer
it was kind of painfull ;P
I tried it out today at the Apple Store and was nice and wowed but the display looked very dim and needs a better OLED display to get better brightness
I love watching you destroy Apple shit !!!
Another proprietary charging plug? Apple? Who would have guessed?!  🙄
instead of breaking one. buy me one ;)
All this googles are useless and crap!
The apple fans will hate this video 🤭
Quest 3 better and way way cheaper.  This is probably the most overpriced device I have ever heard of . If it was the only vr headset then you could maybe justify it .   Can I ask why you’ve just damaged a £3500 device - do you have money to burn or something ? 🤕
Bro just fucked 3500$
If it’s glass people would complain when it shatters, if it’s plastic people will complain when it scratches. There’s no winning. 🤷‍♂️
100,000 views an hour, you made it 🎉
The price of this product, to the quality of components they are using..... seems very very off. They want these to look ugly quickly so people have to buy another. EDIT: HOW is there so much plastic on such important parts of this? It's like a $50 toy.
Apple VisionScam Pro.
Another reasons not to buy first-generation products
Interesting, thought the front cover would be a more scratch resistant. (Time for tempered glass after market protectors I guess.)
I wonder if you where a gas mask while burning stuff jerry. Lol
Can I use your video on my channel but with my voiceover?
i will never span money on that product
Debrand breakdown skin when?
I love your videos but man sometimes they hurt my soul.
you literally are robocop waow
It's not right thing you did. Unfollow him all👎🏾
JerryDestroyEverything
The Vision Pro already has some alternative input methods.
i hate it so much when you scratch things 😫 goosebumps of doom
I wonder if he voided the warranty.
Apple tried to make this shit hard for you specifically so their technology can be kept secretly but obviously they forgot that you have the patience of a 3 toed sloth.
More of the level 9 pick in future please
So Jack comparing mkbhd with dumb Justine 😂
Did you do the Meta Quest 3?
Great, but now you can still use it as a sleeping mask :D
best tech video I have seen in a long time, I love it.
YOU CAN SCHEDULE TEXT MESSAGES ON IPHONE JERRY GOD DAMN IT
you've put it back together off screen - right? ...... right???
3:53 THAT is VERY bad!!
Bro was scratching my soul with this one
"The Yapple vision pro"
Really enjoyed watching you destroying the most expensive gadget apple has ever produced :D
I know It's a bit too late but a Sim card ejector tool releases the side straps from main housing. You can see the tiny holes where the straps meet the goggles.
why. not do the quest and compare and contrast the internals? you have none of the generations on your channel
I'm hearing impaired and the fact that the subtitles are not the same as what is being said makes me irrationally angry lol.
Also you did NOT open the battery? (ok, maybe outside this time).
If you press 0 on your keyboard repeatedly you can play a drum beat
Oh man i wish i had one
Nobody gonna mention that apples goggles look near identical to ready player one
The teardown skin for the front would be cool provided it can work with it.  Seeing as the quality of the eye contact option is pretty average
just goes to show we are going to buzz word the shit out of something just to make it cheaper. i blows my mind that we shoot our selves in the foot over and over just to make some cash.
12:13 I wonder how that that plug jibs with EU's “common charger directive”.
Now lets see you put it back together and turn it on like you do with the phones 😆
So the main thing we know that in near future, iPhone screens will be soft and scratchy at level 2 WHILE also not drop-resistant, brittle inside. What a masterplan. Either you break it or at least wear out.
10:03 STOOOOP 😬😬😬
Any non influencer got this ? 😢🤡
Main question is, does it come with 3.5mm jack? Noo but for real it looks like desperate try to find new niche on the market and repeat sucess of iphone and ipad but given questionable quality it also looks as dying man's last spasms 😶
Oh he got money fr
Apple: We will no longer use plastic in our products. Apple Vision Pro's screen: I am a joke to you?! 😑 Meanwhile Apple justifies to public: "Our" lay of plastic is 120% recyclable. 😊"  Also me: Bruh... 💀💀😑
You may need the Apple polishing cloth 😱
Спасибо за разбор
Does it still work??
wtf, you manufacture wheelchairs?
apple has always cared more about drop resistance than scratch resistance. for instance, ceramic shield. great drop protection, but holy frig does it ever scratch way easier than the glass they used before ceramic shield.  apple believes if you always take perfect care of your products (which isn't hard to do), you should have no problems. and they are right about that.
The apple fan boys defending this are insane. Any time samsung or other phone makers has released anything that was even remotely this easy to scratch they had field days(for good reason) but now suddenly its a great thing
Buying something for $3,500 just to destroy is beyond my tax bracket and makes my brain bleed.
Shameful to destroy this jewel of engineering of technology like that for just one video… in fact test of resistance not very interesting, it’s will be a dislike for me.
The pain The horror The agony  The terror
Watching JRE is kinda like reverse-asmr. Relaxing nails on the chalkboard. His voice makes up for it though
Glass would’ve probably made it too heavy and uncomfortable
That was so painful to watch. That screeching sound when you scratch metal always makes me shiver. 😅
This is masterclass of engineering
To study optics durability, come up with a new test.  Paper towel, tissue, cotton, sandpaper
BROOO WHYYYYYY
imagine you tear down that thing and then realize you forgot recording 😱
It is so big. I beleive next generations will be much smaller especially the long cable battery
If that was real wool it wouldn’t have lit on fire. There’s a reason firefighters use it in the gear.
Looks like a recipe for brain cancer. I’ll pass. Go to the gym and get outside people..
Plastic lenses? No thnx, every apple product looks flawed.
Major kylo Ren vibes once you hit that lenticular lens layer 😳
now put it back together😂😂😂😂
For $3500, they should make them out of synthetic sapphire, like a decent watch.
what a heartbreaking video
Selling an Apple Vision Pro used for 1 day. Minor scratches.
2 lenses, a sock headband, and plastic instead of glass. $3500, yep sounds like Apple
Turn the lens into Johnny 5.
Jerry in the lense reflection ✌🏻😊
being a vr fan, q3, i felt this video, even though its the usual overpriced apple garbage
“Seeing apple branch out for the first time in a decade” buddy they invented AirPods and smart watches
Quit it! 😂
In all fairness to accessibility, you do have the ability to use it without the function of your fingers. There is a feature called Dwell allowing for all controls to be done without hands.
Can I have that slightly scratched Apple Vision Pro please 🙏?😅
Been waiting for this video 😂
awesome
Some serious asmr at 10:03 🥴
I’m having goosebumps when he scratches it hahaha how’s that?
All the glass is plastic for 3,500 dollars? I'm so done with apple
WHATDAFUQ are you doing?
The new whistlindiesel tech channel ❤️
it’s *
10:02 that is the sound of 3.5k melting away
Unbelievable crap. Thank you Zack, i enjoyed that "teardown" hahah , someone must stop apple from making all that scrap!
He starts to clickbait 😢😢😢
Thank you apple its shit
i guess the front plastic is for weight distribution
We all new this would happen
Can you please start a channel reading kids stories? Your voice is truly 1 of a kind!
You just saved me $3500. Thanks.
makes me so mad
Destruction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pq todo careca e vilão 😢
這一個台幣多少???
Ok. Definitely not buying that dystopian device. Phone is already bad.
😍😍
What are you doing with destroyed devices?
Bros spent 3k on this crap to do a durability test with it. I mean, I guess it’s weak and not water resistants so. Be gentle with the Apple Vision Pro!
first time im feeling that phone repair guru > JRE
8:49 I'm not saying that 800 dollars is anywhere near a normal price for that, but apple would probably do it without scratching the frame or a risk of damaging an internal component
Bandage on his thumb Still cuts towards himself
I was really interested in the vision pro until you pointed out the click is those two fingers - with my arthritis, I often can't bend my fingers much. Fun video as always!
Apple shocked Samsung rocked
Jerry: "My patience is immeasurable." 😅
Best part about these is you can technically write this off as a business expense once you record yourself destroying it lol
ASMR knife on metal scratch
Sometimes i felt you are a comedian too 😄 Last one was hilarious 😂😂
Why is Apple obsessed with putting “pro” after everything
Thank you Jerry for showing us the real life. Not the hype and marketing. Long time fan from Estonia!
1:29  Pull tabs that actually work the first time? Apple is going insane
It’s plastic! Wow! Like your Samsung z flip screen!
if u dont want it give it to me
i dont get all that hype about this product.. when google glass came in 2013, everybody lose their shit.. everybody was talking about cameras of google glass like they are still recording and eventually google glasses was forbidden on some public places.. there were lot of shittalk about it till the point google stopped developing that glasses, which I personally think it was good idea using augmented reality. and now I feel like everybody is crazy about this apple vision, like it is most revolutionary piece of technology.. am i missing something?
Nice, but im not sure its going to be a commonly used device around the world after all its a complex design trying to fix a problem that didn't exist.  But im sure there will be a few of those in the next year better and cheaper than this but still will not be as popular as a phone.
Honestly it's sad what you have turned into. I used to enjoy watching your videos. Now I can see they are one sided. There's a video from fix it, and they do a way better tear down of the apple vision pro. you just like to tear stuff apart, but hay whatever makes your money
Apple straight up lying!! They said it’s glass - now it’s plastic. They show pictures and videos where you can clearly see realistic eyes, reality is just a blueish pixelish screen which mimics eyes.. not even your own.  How can this be legal!??
It hurts but is also oddly satisfying to see you intentionally destroy something that i really really want but probably never ever will afford
Didn't need JerryRig to tell me that Apple made this thing like complete garbage, but it was nice seeing the product torn down to it's guts
This is history before our eyes, 🇧🇷
Tell me you are tall without telling me you are tall. "i reflexively ducked under a virtual display"
again this psychopath.
To keep the tears of lonliness out 😂😂
The kid: MOM I AM DONE TAKING EVERY PART APART OF THE APPLE VISION PRO  Mom: Nice job son! Now *put it all back together*
ouch, that hurt
Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas is the greatest description I’ve ever heard
800$ for a piece of Plastic Glass shit. The fanboys will still buy it.
why are the subtitles so completely wrong lol
with the  vision pro apple wins the hearts of many anndroid users tho
That is some cool design.
Pretty safe to say you are the only person doing this to their new Apple Vision Pro.
I LOVE THIS VIDEO<3  SO SATISFYING OMG
I love this channel..  Here’s a £3500 bit of tech.. let’s destroy it 😂
Not gonna lie JerBear, this one was rough to watch 😮‍💨
@6:41, Zach has tape on his thumb
Why are your subtitles so different to what you're saying?
That shit is made in china for 20$ a unit and sold to Americans for 3500 and they buy the shit 😂
It's been a while since one of these hurt.
Jerry You are heartless
Great video, as always :D
So how well did it work after the test?
I really love this teardown and durability test. Great to finally see inside of Apple Vision Pro . Thanks JRE
Omg😮
I cried watching this
At lease turn it on once
Even tho I know what to expect, it was still soo painful to watch 😭
Bamboozled hahahaha
Not as durable as the viewer bots you're using...
They even thought to protect against Tears of Loneliness"  ;o)
He's already got his money back from the views of this video and will continue to to make a profit from this video. To anyone that says he wasted so much money on this clearly don't understand how YouTube works.
What does this tell us? Stop buying expensive crap from Apple. The Quest 3 does the same thing.
For $3500, what a piece of garbage
This hurt to watch.
I want him to go to therapy after this
I want to see Louis Rossmann repair this.  PPBUS G3 HOT
Give me this 😂
If I was the Apple engineer that worked on this thing I would be squirming.
referencing two absolute clowns in the space to review the software is class Jerry...
This is painful to watch :/ what a waste
Apple is all hype and overpriced. Scamming people
Not an apple fan as they charge so much for form over function. The engineering in this looks for the first time since the iPod that it may be worth it. If only you didn’t need a neck brace to bear the weight
After this video we keep asking ourselves how the hell this glasses worth so goddam much.
i wished to buy it but i cant afford it and you buy it and destroy it so easy cuz the video views makes you even rich to buy it twice ! world is not fair tbh
You know the device will go onto the Shelf of Shame when the title of the video goes as 𝗕𝗲 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 [𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲]
لا ينصح الاصحاب القلوب الضعيفة ✅
does it matter if the front is scratched though?
Great point on accessibility though!!
What's absurd is that for $3500 it should fucking do VR too. WTF. LOL! You're stuck with apple's shitty vision software
The cover is a plastic mold with sprayed glass on the inside
After watching this video, I gained the trust again. Jerry Rig Everything :|
How does an Apple employee feel watching this?
Goodbye $3,500 😅
Battery case disassemble?
I think they should ditch the front display and just make those 2 fans visible from the outside. 2 giant spinning fans for eyes would just look too cool.
what!!! no other reviewers showed the cable detaching from the battery. amazing teardown tho
My heart started racing how you are destroying stuff
I love the destruction. Its done with such joy
Best vision pro review ❤
Its just a glorified VR Headset IMO
It hurts
This apple headset has more fans than some of their "Pro" laptops which is wild
Ouch
Man, imagine getting a $3500 device...only to brutally tear it up! 😄
For the first time in the history Jerry Rig Everything I truly enjoyed every second of the destruction of a product by the Apple farm.
I don’t see why the front glass has to be as scratch resistant as an iPhone. You aren’t putting this thing in your pocket every day
:)))
Sir, this is just awesome! Thank you for the look inside. Really scary how flammable the strap is! I would love to see the led panels working without the lenses. A comparison between the iphone and the nacked AVP-oLED screen would be interesting. And also the frontdisplay without the lenticular lenses. Have you managed to get the thing working again?
Damn bro
Heck yeah 🎉
What a joke Apple product 😂😂😂 More $3000 for plastic build ??? Crazy
The knowledge of how human insides are looking is rather freely accessible. There is no need to experiment on yourself. 🩹😁
We’ll be living in the stacks soon!
Glass is glass and glas breaks less that plastic 😂🤣💔
At this point I'm so desperate for the Apple Vision Pro that I would buy this broken one from JRE.
Mans just destroyed 5 months of my rent 😫
this hurts to watch
I have watched this guy for years and... this one hurt.
10:02 yeah ok please never do that shit again, thanks  like nails on a chalkboard
Glass is glass and apple glass is plastic
The Lightning connector has been reanimated and it’s thicccc 😮
Ive got mixed feelings about the vision pros but they are building on me and are pretty cool and seeing the tear down is always interesting but even more on something so new and different! And the best part is not having  to pay 3500 to suffer breaking into the product to see What’s inside1 so keep up the great work bud!
Awesome video, love your content, but one question: What do you do with the hardware after you take it apart? I think it would be super cool if you were to give away some parts of those expensive dissembled devices, that would be pretty cool.
Bro got no chill
$3500 swaaha 😢
Watching this Gives me Panic attack
Zack cut his thumb around the 6:40 mark 🤕
Got it. So if you scratch it with a razor blade for no reason it scratches. If you burn the fabric, it burns. This is a stupid video.
Why you didn't tear down the battery tho?
knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas 💀
Plastic lenses in something this expensive is absolutely ridiculous
No matter how many times I hear it, the sound of scratching metal on metal triggers all of my sensorial nerves at once🥶
this is the only one I’ve watched that has really made me sad
Just wondering where will this gadget meet the keys and coins.
$3499 R.I.P.🤣
I tried it, 1000% garbage. Nah, just way before it's time. Too expensive, the feature that set this headset apart from the quest 3 are pretty pathetic in reality.
radical
This tutorial was the worst. I followed it step-by-step, but wasn’t able to rig my Apple vision, Pro. Could you kindly change the name of your channel to Jerry destroys everything?
I'm pulling out hairs from, my bald head each minute 😢
I'm not gonna lie. This was painful to watch 😬
What the heck does this thing even do?
if i was a apple product i wouldnt want to be here lol
Grandma says clear that table!!!
I’m blind out of one eye so how would that work 🤔
I started watching the video and had to stop. It’s too painful to watch something so expensive get destroyed.
Hahahaha the love of a thousand grandma. You gotta give the man monumental credit for the smart analogies he builds and the vocab he uses in his videos’s script. It wouldn’t be the same without that. You have that chill tone that sometimes goes ironic and sometimes is serious and you have to wonder which is which. That’s what makes me appreciate the channel all the more
Get ready, player one 🙂
3500 for plastic screens, Apple is tripping..
Whyy
Era esse vídeo que eu precisava ver 🎉🎉
The most long waited video
nice "ready player one" refference XD
$3500 worth of disposable gadget. Battery will be 40% in 2 years. Verdict? A money pit. Like the rest of Apple products. I will not buy until its $199
This is offensive to me, as a broke person.
I can forgive plastic outer layer, but plastic lenses is BS.
I’m sick to death of hearing “not gonna lie”
Why do people pay this mutch for shit?
Yeah Swedish! Smörgåsbord 10:16
This is the saddest strip down yet.... "tears of loneliness" 🤣😂
WHY jerry WHY? 🙄🤕
Jerry the Destroyer 😅
*The calm and pure almost AI professional narration is worth any second, demolition man! LOL*  And the Bot shot with the broken headset on, is absolutely genius! 😅😅😅 (Watched in full with full appreciation)
Hurts to see 3500$ get treated like this 😅
Don't cut towards your thumbs unless you cut it bazillion times before :D
Absolutely mutilated ;-;
Thanks Zack! I was told you already shown what happens when you continued the scratch tests to see what would happen and now I know! Thanks for "experimenting" on things so I don't have to. Also since I watch your videos I always use razorblade and scissors to show my relatives that they should not worry about the screen getting scratched by keys or sth :D They always get a fright tho :)
After saying the love 1000 grandmas  how could you burn it? 😢
I CANT HANDLE THE SOUNDS
I'm willing to sell a kidney if it provide deep dive tech.
WGT
I hate this trend of tech companies essentially designing their products to become landfill. Not only is this next to impossible to repair, but also recycle...
At $3500. Its still going to flop
Reverse engineering by Samsung employee
08:09 - I was so very benefited by your teaching me about scheduling text messages in Google Messenger!
Damn let's go 😅🎉i just waited for this
can it run doom ?
Oh hey, another overpriced item to hook you into the apple ecosystem that you literally can't even buy without an iphone. I swear I never have anything good to say about this company.
Buy garbage, receive garbage.
Bro is casually telling us how expensive the screen is to replace while destroying it
As an apple employee this video was very informative as this type of information would never be available to us if people like you never did these tests. With that being said it hurt my soul to see you damage the Vision Pro 😭 not because i am fond of the product but because you spent so much money.
Apple and Corning (Samsung S24 Ultra) changing this man's iconic words. Glass no longer scratches at a level 6 and deeper grooves at a level 7 anymore lol.
Love your work, but I want to cry 😢 I only can wish for a beautiful device like Vision Pro! Keep up the good work.
Maybe be impressive but by god people look like absolute knobs wearing them I'm public. It's a niche product looking for a market that doesn't really exist.
This vision pro is a AMAZING PRODUCT
Wonder if he could put that back together 🤔
Is that LTT precision screwdriver?
what a cheap bullshit.. 3500 dollars for this man
please do the voice acting in Russian ❤
Please link the video where you put everything together again...
Apple putting a plastic display on the front of a $3500 product and then charging $800 to fix it is the most Apple thing ever
Why did I get mad!
When Jerry puts a product on his table, it reminds me of a butcher putting down a leg of beef.
Am in the wrong job - all these YouTubers must have a shed load of money. Mad getting this item just to destroy it. Couldn’t watch it.
How many of you can’t handle the scratch noise in this channel!   Everytime uncomfortable goosebumps when hearing the knife scratches 😂 Kudos to jerry right knife 😅
*Jerry is the first person in the world to destroy Apple Vision*
More like The Love of 1000 Little Chinese Children
Can't do full glass because it would be too heavy. Kind of silly that they're advertising it that way, and even sillier to have done it in the first place.
He breaks things in the most respectful way possible
this was the coolest jerry video since the casetify roast.
There are videos, out there, of Tesla trucks being 'driven', hands-free, by someone wearing one.  When I saw that, I knew that we have just gone way too far with our tech obsession.
Needs an iSnorkel
Most people would think that 3500$ is excessive, but wow, does this have an immaculate design.
L😂😂😂😂😂😂
Holy crap!  That is an amazingly engineered gadget.
Hello
Let’s get him to 200.000 Subscribers
jerry is a big strong boi
to replace that "glass"  will probably cost $1000
This was painful to watch
i feel so uncomftable watching you Scratching that glass
did you buy the protection plan?
bruh i went to the apple store to buy a vision pro and they said my eyes were too far apart to calibrate (skull emoji)
Damn is iJustine still a thing
wait so where’s the glass
Only Jerry rig would call something a work of art while destroying it 😂
re loco
Just bought the knife!
This one was epic ❤
i didnt realize i could be so saddened by someone destroying their own property as much as i was by this video
Im not being funny, $3500? wtf
iJustine can't review anything. She's apple sheep. She automatically likes everything from Apple.
Please don't be breathing any of those fumes Zack! 🙏
We want cyber truck rig test😂😂😂destroy Tesla like you destroyed Apple I mean their products 😂😂😂
you always give me anxiety with that damn box cutter
I just wish the scratching with the knife stops... I always skip that part its literally making me feel bad
Ah yes, my weekly video of someone destroying a $2000 product knowing I’m too scared to replace the battery in my $300 smartphone
I noticed that he still has the golden apple watch 🙌
Years of research and hard work was just sabotaged in 13 minutes  Tim Cook in pains 😮
Cool inner workings I must say. Can't see paying $3500 for that adult toy, Just sayin.
I found myself watching this with the same unease Id have in watching a 10+ minute clip of train wreck with bodies… nausea, discomfort, and horror.
Those knife noises hurt too much
Who disliked this 1.6k times?
Have you tried and tested the Magic Leap lenses? They have had similar tech from years now. It would be great if you make a video comparing them!!
Apple will Blacklist you lol
Zach loved it so much... he even kept using it after killing it 💀
I can’t find emphasize this enough everyone like this video comment on the video watch all the ads because this video costed him over $4000!! Just for you to be entertained it’s the least you can do
YT channels have come a long way from the heady days of iPhone shredding in a Vitamix.
Nooo!!!! You can't simply like android and apple products!!!!!! blasphemy
Lol kinda dangerous way to cut without gloves😂
Video súper difícil de ver … 😢
You probably have had coments like this before but usually, I don't mind you braking a phone because they're $900-$1500, maybe $2500, for like the 5 that phones that are outliers, but watching you pick away at vision pros is making me cringe so hard rn. Like 1500-2500 is rent for most people or like a big car repair, but 3500 is like picking up my PC and throwing it on the floor. Like, I don't know how you keep your sanity. I know it's just tech, but it's pricey and it does things we haven't even seen other companies do yet. But I guess we keep pushing forward right. One day it will become old news. But to do things like this now and not even a week or 2 after it drops, it's just.... ldk have a good day sir.😅
Why do I feel like this is torture ?
Lol at the end
I can’t pinch my fingers so guess this isn’t for me
This feels so wrong and so right at the same time also Apple Care is the biggest ripoff in history it’s basically a down payment on future repairs 😂
A very, very expensive toy. No more no less.
I’ve been waiting for this moment since Vision Pro was released 😂
For the price i will stick with  N real glasses
Good morning!
So, in yen dollars, this thing cost about 3 dollars and 50 cent to make 😂😂.
let me get some pop corn for this one
Now put it back together
Apple telling its glass (when its not ) Forces u to give 500bucks for apple care , and even with that 500 dollar they charge u saphire repair cost for a plastic part
Jerry Looks Like Robocop😂
An interesting product of alien technology made possible by child labour.
overpriced af
Best not let Jerry borrow your newest devices
3 Questions for Zac:  1: Do you have insurance on your hands like other professional "hand models" 2: How do you pass OSHA (I die every time I see the knife being pulled out) 3: Why are you so chaotic. Who hurt you man?
Apple-Garbage😂
Days ago I watch a guy drop test a lot. There's a out screen that if broke can be pull off it and still use it.
Have to skip the aluminum scratching
I wonder how many people have hate-commented cause there were a limited number of Vision Pro's, and you just "destroyed" one for all of them to see🤣 Even so, great work! Keep it up!😎
will you assembly it back ?
This cut me deep to watch.
You just smashed Apple, like, literally!
Man... I think it might just be the pricetag that made me flinch a couple of times on this one xD
Iphone has scheduled msg.. using SHORTCUTS you can do that 🙌🏻🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Hahahaah another great review like the iPhone 15 reviews
with the release of vision pro, I realized that valve index is not such an expensive thing😅
I screamed when I saw the clip art
The Oasis from ready player one is a good one.
it is gonna be a flop lmao. NO ONE NEEDS THIS, the people who get it will get tired of it in a month.
apple are good for mobile product such as phone, tablet and laptop...i feel like they should be careful if they want to start making peripherals and should take the rugged route if so
Why are you destroying an Apple Vision Pro?
The laminated glass is a stroke of genius. It can be scratched from the outside AND crack from the inside. Double the fragility, outstanding move!
Still wondering why it physically hurts me watching him destroy his own expensive toys 😅
At 4200€ euros. It’s saddly, overpriced. It should start at 2500 but hey 👋.
they do have scheduled text messages?
Why did they put plastic layer on the OUTSIDE of the glass panel instead of putting it on the INSIDE. I do have my theory - planned obsolescence.
Another rare moment of Jerry saying different levels of scratch instead of “scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level “
uuu that hurts aahg
Calmly dismantling $3500 lol
I believe the first attempt to remove the laminated glass was when you accidentally sliced your thumb and then improvised a solution by covering it with electrical tape. 🤣
Horrendous noise scratching any glass or metal, you need to mute that shit.
How many likes for you to put it back together
10:03 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🫨🫨🫨🫨
apple garbage once again lmao
It hurts to see this!
Jesus loves you all repent of your sin and accept him today to get saved and live the word
“Hi I’d like to use my Apple care.”  Employee- wow… what happened sir? “Dunno I think it just stopped working”
you broke my dream
Can I own that wrecked Vision Pro 😢😢 I want it so bad... But just a dream
My gosh 😅
is anything okay with you???
We all know what u did in those two hours ✊
And iJustine will praise this product like a God
Bro lets his intrusive thoughts win for a living
the plastic film on the front is painfully obvious a deliberate way to ensure many many dollars spent on replacements. I can not stand apple products, the only one i use is the ipad pro for tattoo stencil designs and that's it. the moment another brand sells the same product, im trading up
How jerry absolutely annihilates stuff that i cannot buy is crazy
This video hurt my soul. Being that I want one so bad, but there is no way I could begin to afford that. Zach, you should have put a warning on the beginning of this video. :(
Dammmm 3500 usd …
Sorry to interrupt!! You forgot to mention recycled plastic 😉
Bro took a hit for us 🥺
Never understood why they use mAh for battery size and not Wh
The pain!!!! Painful to see the destruction of thousands of dollars of hardware. Yet, here I am ...
So much anxiety in whole video....
imagine comparing this techniqe with a 3.500 Dollar car...
Why is the processor not in the battery block?
I love watching you destroy apple stuff. So many sheeple crying at home watching this.
I dislike apple and all of their chronically shitty tactics and sociopathic tendencies but watching him scratch up the screen made me cringe.
It's a very interesting new toy.
painful to watch
this hurts my soul
He really puts the "tear" in teardown
I have constant chills watching him scratch this! 😮
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The love of a thousand grandmas 😅
$3500 down the drain. Yep, this is content
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂
Apple says Jerry don't use apple genuine products 😂
Watched the s24 being destroyed then this... you'll give me blood pressure.
💁🏻‍♂️:breaking apple vision pro?+ Me: no, breaking my soul,heart,body,brain,eyes
can''t wait to see the video on re-assembling it!!
פעם הבא תביא לי זה חבל לקלקל
Sweet Jesus 😉 3500 $ of scrap
Just out of curiosity, how are you supposed to do any video chat with those things over your face?
An unrated version of what iFixIt did just couple of days ago.
Why????! ! ! :(
10:03 - give me the shivers 😖
അളിയാ .... സൂപ്പർ 👌...
2:54 the love of -1000 grandmas.
For that much money money I'll be waiting on Apple Vision Amateur
It’s a cycle. The more expensive an item he breaks. The more views. Which makes him more money to cover the cost of the item he broke.
comments on every video are ppl complaining about price, like it's first gen tech and it's apple, ofc it's expensive. mine'll be here this week 🙏🏼
Amazing destroy
6:20 shear girth
$4000.00 for this...LETS DESTROY IT!!! So you dont have to..
bro just obliterated my yearly pay
I have to honestly say that this is one of the few times, it really hurt to see a beautiful hardware device like this destroyed! I wish i could get one but they don't sell it yet here in Belgium!
apple co trash !! dislike for wasting time !!
this video hurt the most.
Can I have remains?
and when one realizes they probbaly pay 30$ to manufacture the thing with chinese wage slaves with gratings on the windows so they dont sucide on impulse. but its APPLE so its OK!!! ...........
Looking foward to the usual reassembly video, fingers crossed it still works
Every scratch that you make, made me feel like i am in kidney surgery but without anesthesia... So satisfying...
Wow, what a piece of crap hardware!
i wanna get as rich as this guy someday
I think you shouldn’t review items you got no idea why they are built this way and not another. For me this video is clearly a clickbait and you lost in my eyes long ago with doing pointless videos with not enough research from your side (like using iPhone for 6 months which I can’t believe you,you even used for a week cause the simplest things can be learnt from the moment you turned on iphone or showing us Prime drink).Imagine having on your head something heavy made from metal(check other VR headsets first 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️) Glass at the front is to protect when it gets dropped and after is fully functional. Check other VR headsets before giving any I mean ANY opinion. Just stick with phones because that’s clearly your environment and you are not a targeted person for this product at all which your lack of knowledge is just showing. Lens can be scratched(like in every vr). Jezz, it so painfull watching this when done clearly just for views and not a decent informative “review” 🤦🏼‍♂️ so many other people on YT done so much better job than you. 👌🏻
I'll wait for whatever android product matches this 😂
Well the power bank has to be come up with a usb-c port otherwise it wont be sold in europe.
hope you are not breathing that smoke lol
First headset that's made you duck from a menu? Never used a Quest 3 I take it?
Apple people must be dying inside seeing him rip apart their futuristic vision😅
Ahhhh that scraching sound with the knife uder the screen dfrove me insane.
Really appreciate the Ready Player One reference. I absolutely adore that book series, and the movie was good in it's own right as well. Hope you're having a great year so far! Thank you for the killer content.
"Laminated glass" - apple is really out here doing a Chinese scam with all their gymnastics word salad. This bullshit needs to be pushed back to apple and the whole industry coz you know it's just a matter of time that another brand will copy all these word salad to describe a plastic.
At least have some shame apple 😂😂🤡
When was the last time you bought something really expensive then attacked it with a utility knife?
😂😂 ...and tears of loneliness
Are we still getting an apple foldable? I vote for the name apple turnover 😅😅😅😂
this is dumb, Drop it, Throw it, Why take a razor to it instantly like thats some sort of test lmao
i would DEMAND i refund!!!!!!!!! PLASTIC for 1000s BUCKS!!!!!! oh HELL NO! for the price should be made of PLATINUM GOLD AND SILVER! ( i mean obisuly you cant becuase doing it for vide) butforeverone else?
As someone who just needed 8 stitches from a slipped utility blade, watching Jerry with that sketchy blade handling makes me so uncomfortable
How could Brownlee not notice it's plastic lmao
I think it's cool but no chance in hell am I walking around with that on, give me it in my glasses and you have me
i canttttt
I havent been able to bring myself to buy an apple product on about a decade, once they started making everything proprietary and charging so much more for more or less the same product other companies are making. This is their first product in a while that has my interest, but wont be getting my money just yet... this video cemented that decision. ty!
ngl that hurt
What are you doing!!??? 😳😳😳
13:28 Hitman X Robocop (Crossover)
So its just a overpriced iphone. 😂😂 apple soy boys praise this crap, many companies had years ago.
Oh no 🙉, I was planning on NOT being gentle with mine 😮😮
It's awesome how he destroys expensive stuff without batting an eye. I wish he'd destroyed the battery pack too
I love the fact he is an android user and regularly criticizes Apple but still appreciates and loves a good Apple product.
Awesome
You are the only person that should have this
Seriously It’s very hard to watch your videos destroying every fresh brand new products of such popular brands🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
That's what I was actually waiting to see on the net just now 😅
I don't understand why that front panel is "glass". Why not just use metal, they are just projecting everything the camera records
This screen at $3500 is completely unacceptable
5:34 This is one of the best reasons to buy this device.
Still amazed JRE has a left thumb.
@ifixit please rate this durability test / tear down 😂
boring
His YouTube channel say Jerryrigeverything is a joke. If he is legit he should destroy Revian and tesla cybertruck also. What a scam channel. Petition to all his subscribers to challenge him. 😂
Me crying silently when seeing Zach destroy something in 10 minutes that costs almost 4000$ :P
Look like its been knitted with the love of a thousand Grandmas😂😂😂
The fact there was still protective sleeves on the battery pack makes this even more terrifying
I think I’m the only one that doesn’t like this guy
Its real therapeutic watching an Apple product being destroyed...
I can't believe 11 years passed watching zac's videos, from actual repairing phones with the correct tools to catastrophic blades phone durability tests and purchasing expensive phones.
Destroying 3500$ to earn even more by viewership 💀
Finally the YT video we were all waiting for! 😅. How will Apples green environment fit into another premium product that handles repairs as enemies? That the AppleVisionPro isn’t scratch resistant at all is shocking for a device that A. had this price and B. is used more freely inside and outside and therefore in danger to getting scratches all the time.
God the ASMR of getting to see the lvl9 pick shatter the glass every video wpuld be amazing lmao
By Odin, that was epic. I can't afford this, but it was nice to participate in the destruction 👍🏻
Who is going to dismantle the battery, so I can upload DIY videos on it? 🤔
This guy actually paid 3,500 to take apart 3,500 worth of hardware Lol Lmao. 😂
Can we see the deleted scene of you cutting your thumb?
God my eyes
In the EU it costs 5000€ and i just cant understand how someone is gonna pay so much for this crap
Apple taking all the notes for their oversights.
seriously bro 😆🤣🤣🤣
Where is bend test
usually i am a fan of your teardowns and your durability tests but this was just vandalism, no attempt to tak epart without destroyig it, Such a shame. Ifixit tore this down with no real problem so you just wanted to destroy even though you praised the tech over and over
The way you ripped apart 3500$ had me want to cry
I am waiting for "Galaxy Vision Ultra"
Apple team after seeing this video : “ Holly smokes we must think seriously about the next versions materials quality “ 😂
Mkbhd it’s awesome piece of tech I Justine its fabulous .. i love apple vision..  Meanwhile jerry let’s see the inside and never enjoy it again … 3,500 invested in a vedio ..😂
Update on the bunker 😶
I’m here Jerry
Imagine after all that wrecking you realise you didn't press record ⏺️😅
I'm Apple fanboy but contrary to expectations I'm not convinced of the functionality and usefulness of this vision, I'm disappointed because I don't have the slightest interest to own it, do any of you know why?
There's a typo in the last sentence of the descrption: "... are also made form plastic". Nice video!
*parents in the '90* : _don't stay too close to the tv!_ *people in 2024* :
its crazy how he is destroying me more than he destroys  that device
Why would it not be plastic? They need to sell you version 2 as well!
I'm still amazed why people don't boycot Apple more.
@11:23 Me trying to fix my life after too many bad decisions
One of the best!
Smörgåsbord :DDDD
I’m pretty sure dude just became apples biggest enemy! He made their product look so cheap. Like it’s a money grab, such applesauce.
I hate that knife
This video has more destruction than WW2
*1998: Don't sit too close to the tv.* *2024: This thing.*
The Vision Pro is so much cooler looking without the front plastic/glass! Why didn't they just stop there!?
This did not disappoint. :D
When I first saw that and understood what it could do. It scared the hell out of me. The most perfect way to send subliminal messages or whatever is the newest thing, on a supposedly update that will conveniently delete it's self after it's used. And you never know what they're doing to you. There is no way I will ever even look into one.
i waited for this
Cool. Now let’s see Android’s alternative. Oh wait….
That knife 🔪 used across the screen cover sung a tune that nearly gave me a heart attack 10:05 .
Here are some key takeaways from the video:  1. The Apple Vision Pro headset provides an extremely immersive virtual reality experience that impressed even an Android/PC user like the video creator. The hardware and software work together seamlessly to create very realistic virtual environments.  2. However, the exterior "glass" surface is actually plastic laminate that scratches easily at a Mohs hardness level of 3-4. Scratches could interfere with the headset's cameras and sensors. Replacement costs are very high.  3. The aluminum body is very sturdy, with no flex when bent. But there are no visible screws, making repairs very difficult. Many screw types and ribbons cables inside make repairability low.  4. Dual micro-OLED screens with 23 million pixels each provide sharp, vivid visuals. An M2 chip and custom R1 chip work together for low 12ms latency between movement and visuals.  5. Accessibility could be improved for those with impairments, like alternate click options beyond finger taps. Battery life is a bit short at 2 hours - anchor accessories can help extend it.  In summary, the Vision Pro pushes VR technology forward significantly, but sacrifices repairability and durability for the sake of sleek, compact design. The high price also limits wider adoption.
Myran😊
I wonder how long it will take for these to be at a reasonable price
Sometimes I wonder how much joy he gets out of these Videos - getting super expensive stuff and just destroying it while other people would give their left Kidney to get one :-)
Watching Jerry Rig Things, is injurious to health. Can cause heart attacks.
this is brutal
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂😂
Apple are bigger scammers than carti.
Can you do Quest 3 teardown?
Short lived vision pro
This has been one of the most hurtfull videos
Wasnt it suppose to be glass?
"Knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas"  Love it lmao
Electrical tape as a band-aid.... Nice!
❤❤❤❤
Great so i cant even watch … magic on my commute on the train without other people hearing what im watching even if I sit alone and far away from everyone
The love of 1000 grandma's...And yet it burns like plastic.
Built down to a cost to line Tim apples pockets with the money of rich weirdos
This hurts my soul at a depth not previously known by man nor beast 😮. But i also love it!
Looks like something that's created in China for not more than $300 and they sell it for $3500.
Time for the cybertruck
Tears of loneliness 😂 lmao
Where is the picture using this plus the respirator?
❤from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩
WARNING: bone chilling sound at 4:20
Love the oasis reference
i love seeing someone destroy an apple product, overhyped and overpriced junk that people need to see.
Yo, be real. Is there actually any way that this could be good for any content creator? I really don't feel like it... as it's missing ergonomic components as well as it would take hours to get done with high-level production
£3k and he has just destroyed it...
Anker  10/10
it actually looks cooler without the front screen or even the crunchy plastic, guessing casey neistat gonna go that route
Jerry you mentioned that the iPhone does not have scheduled text messages, but you can create an automation to do exactly that. Just like android.
The "OASIS" just watched it yesterday to refresh the memory ✨✨
Very informative thank you
Never have I seen so many things scratched that shouldn't be scratched 😅
The distopian future of broken Apple Vision Pro with finger tapping
Thats just insane  $3500 and the material is so cheap.  Like you know for a fact this is going to scratch like no other.
First there's ifix its vid of taking the vision pro apart nice and clean, and then there Jerry where peace is never an option
Just imagine trying to clean those internal fans 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
do something useful with your life.
Software review to i justine 0:30 nah her review sucked dude
It hurt me to watch this guy to take a knife to these.  But, thanks for doing what others wouldnt dream of doing, so we know how tough/soft these AVP are.
admitedly, it does look kinda clean, that is if you dont accidently drop it.. or do whatever the fuck he is doing in this
thanks!
People may love what you do, even I did back then, but now, it just rubs me off the wrong way. No offence. Couldn't even pass the one minute mark with this one
Wow it hurts to watch this video 😖
Apple-fan-folks are crying tears when watching this teardown 😂
now put it back
The band was knitted by a thousand child*
Problem with modern tech is it's built to only be repaired by the manufacturer
3500 dollars and they give you plastic "glass" 😬
fun fact for anyone wondering, and something that greatly annoyed me when i found it out. you can actually schedule messages on an iphone, but you have to use siri to do it which sucks, its like a half-arsed integration
Does it still work?
I wouldn't have the heart to destroy it...uhh
I love the commentary, wish I could write like that.
Your thumbnails need more attention.
This dismantling is therapeutic.
There are accessibility features for people with the issues you spoke about, there’s also something called dwell where you can look at something for a little bit longer, and it will select it
now please put it back together. 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I'd love to see what happens to all the devices after you tear them down. Do you recycle all the parts? If so, how?
Can you please open the battery? Why are there so many connections between the Vision Pro and the battery?
The much awaited review
How would you rate this video out of 10?
Why this things are almost impossible to repair???
How much can be done by a 2 £ blade
Proprietary Apple plug ... suppose the EU will have word.  As for digitally recreating settings, pass. Westworld in the 1970s had a better idea.
Apparently, the displays alone cost 700$
Apple annoys me so much I can't even watch this video
A fascinating video.
so basically its a scam liek every other apple product
He should expand to completely destroy a Mercedes eqs
“Scratches at 3, with deeper grooves at 4”
Bro you spent 3500 dollars to destroy it😂
This is like a HORROR movie for Apple engineers. 😳  Though the tech inside is beautiful in its own way, too.
The hardest scratch test and durability video I have seen. It was tough to see Zack dig through everything. Great job by the way 😉
I’m living the 7 year old me’s dream through watching you destroying expensive stuff
Being a tech fan, you running this $3500 tech almost gives me trauma😂😂😂😂😂😂
You didn’t even try it 😂
4000$ 😪😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"the rubber is probably there to keep...tears of loneliness from entering into the motorised internals." 😭😭🤣🤣 so, so true 😅😅
Even MKBHD didn’t find to remove the cable from battery 😂
No it's not Plastic, that's just a protective film
Прям кайф как они хрустят 😋
WOOW WHAT a beautiful iPhone cover, where did you buy it?
The thousand grandma's are in tears
Is there a Simpson prediction on this video please 🤣
I almost fainted when you're tearing down that vision pro max gadget, but I remembered it was "JerryRigEverything" that cooled me a little bit.
That was tough to watch
this is a huge leap for technology, apple is good at doing that
:(
Lost Opportunity: You should have tested the tracking performance of the cameras after the scratches. 😓
Biggest load of junk for 3500 bucks ive ever see
How much $ or how many devices have you destroyed so far!😂
Bro this hurts 💔 😢 😂🎉
So if the world is digitally recreated, is it mean if I have severe shortsighted can see clearly when using it?
No final embrulha e manda pra mim😮
My face who is watching all this from Europe. -> 😑
Is this the first generation? the Quest 3 came out in october and as far as I know it can do similar things as the apple vision
Laminated glass should litteraly be 2 pieces of glass held together. The fact that yhe outside is glass make it a lie that theyre marketing it as laminated glass. Now, actually using real laminated glass for this isnt a bad idea. Using plastic might even be better, especially in the case if it breaks. Laminated glass tends to stick together when breaking tho, so in case of an accident it can help protect your eyes. Just too bad they chose to technically lie about it
this may be the most gruesome violation jerry rig has done yet
It's a shame, you're so rich.😂👍
iPlastic Pro
Bro gave me a reason to not buy it.
Ah yes, iJustine and MKBHD, certainly one of the YouTubers of all time.
When  are you fully taking apart the battery pack? Is there a circuit in there? Is there some heat dissipation tech?
This one is like jerry f*ucking smash the shit out of  apple vision pro 😂
Ok, just re-listened to your explanation. Of course, makes perfect sense now. I simply had not considered what is now obvious, lol. (couldn't reply to my original thread below).
Ijustine overreact on everthing
😮😮😮
bro gonna make us cry
this is the first person to destroy this product true chad
cancer causing, eye deforming glasses for 3500 bucks. what a bargain.
First time I’ve witnessed a new technology that has actually worried me. Maybe I’m reaching ‘that’ age now at 30 but we are already so detached from the real world with smartphones alone. This is one step closer to a truly depressing REAL world.
Wait, the reality outside the headset being "augmented" is not being actually seen through the goggles? It's recreated, like a video or movie, inside? I've never heard this before. At minute 11:10 - ish did I hear this correctly, Jerry? F**king stellar video my friend!
Electrical tape as a band aid is a vibe
I bet from 1000 unit that apple made… this is the first unit that gets destroyed
He should have taken an ice hammer to the battery.
I bet robotcop cant watch this video 😅
It hurts
Imagine paying $3500 to watch youtube on a grainy passthrough.
oh my god please vacuum very carefully dude. aluminum powder is flammable as fuck, and a horrible thing to breath in. potentially fatal
Wow, lots of respect to engineers who designed and built this.
Now THAT!! was a brutal watch 💀💀💀
making it so you cant add any battery bank is an L. having to buy more apple ones is dumb
Looks really breakable
Needs cameras 📸 at the back have a complete 360 view!
Its a piece of crap.
I feel bad for that 3500 bucks 😢
It was so painful to watch this tear down… but still loved it
I will say I have become desensitized to him scratching up phones. But watching him destroy this piece of tech sends shivers down my spine once again
If glass is coated with plastic, then why use glass, why not just make it completely plastic? That's right, because the user can accidentally break it, which means he will have to pay a lot of money for repairs.  Completely standard apple engineering))
The most incredible thing about it is the fact that there are people out there willing to pay 3500 for it.
Do the glass eye pieces have any use on their own? Perhaps you can make goggles or glasses 🤓
I mean, what do you use this pile of crap for? Watching movies and answering text messages?
You are the best. 😂
4:20 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
could you also take apart the power bank?
"What's the repairability score for the new Vision Pro?"  "No."
Sure it's plastic, device already too heavy
why buying this ?!
🎉wow
I already wasnt good on my stomach today, I almost puked when I heard the metal scratch sound.
There's as much glass in this that there was titanium in the last iphone 😂
You guys can sell water to a 🐋 i swear 😂
How can Apple sell a product that is flammable?
Knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas 💀💀💀
maybe in 5 or 6 years but not for taht price politic, i love apple but im so disappointed by the quality
i will stay with my quest 3
I just want this charger now 😅😂
ready player one is happening right now
Very impressive engineering by Apple, 12ms delay is insane.  Can't wait for gen 3-4!
Good video as always
Destructive entertainment! SMASH MORE!
Thanks you apple for sponsoring this video!
Tear down
soo, when are you gonna asemple it again
tears of loneliness was personal
The love of 1000 grandma got burned in few seconds, and it smelled like plastic.
my soul left my body when Jerry said its a work of art and then proceeds to vandalize the $3500 art calmy
Wasn't apple sopouse to protect the environment  but they used so much plastic in that unless thing
Thank you so much, awesome. A big bonus for your humor in your videos.
I lost it when he pulled out a lighter I think I just found my new favorite channel 😂😂
And all of a sudden, everyone in 2024 became an italian.🤌🤌
Me watching Jerrys videos him completly torturing stuff knowing i will never in my life event be able to touch those things 💀💀
This guy is preparing devices for apocalypse
You must do drop test Jerry 🤷‍♂.
This thing is $3500 ....
JerryBreaksEverything.. Love it.. Lol. 👍
Amezing work men Weldon and proud
6:23 Apple Vision deixando sua marca.
What's funny is that people will collectively give Apple a pass for using plastic on a device that costs an entire month's pay for many people. The tech is cool, but Apple should've made it with more robust build materials.
This is click bate
Gus like me could only dream of owning one and you destroyed one
Can’t wait till the Vision Pro 2 😂
A piece of expensive unrepairable crap!
How many Apple employees are watching this? Did the Care plan cover this?
Apple Vision Pro give EU more reason to bad shit ass apple anti-consumer product !
If Tim cook watches this. You're dead man.😅😅😅
Imagine he forget to turn on the camera recording 😅😅😅
My goodness 3500USD destroyed in minutes! My heart hurts!
Why not put a bigger battery in the powerbank?? I have a small Samsung powerbank that is 10.000mA. It cost like 30 dollars and after 2 years its still going strong. So surely they could have done a 10.000mA without affecting production cost more then a dollar. Maybe its because of flight rules or something ??
U drop it, u will cry
Does this guy know this thing is worth $3500.😅😅😅
I'm not a big Apple fan but seeing him casually destroying this makes me rage so hard and idk why 😭
indeed rocked my socks
Of course it’s not glass, you keep those on your head for hours, any extra grams can be filled after some time.  I believe it’s very smart that they have not used glass… if was glass would be heavier and if you drop them breake immediately..
thank you for exposing another scammer.
Thanks for the callout on accessibility for people with spinal cord injury.
A little disappointed that he didn't gutt the battery and the electronics completely bare to the aluminium case
Seems like an easy device for a hard plastic snap on protector, or soft adhesive at the least. You’ve paid 3500, what’s another 50 or so.
It really did come
This is absolutely non-repairable, however i liked the way it is taken apart in an unique style.
If I payed for it id have 3500€ of fog in my eye's. It would be nice to have. But just trying it at a store I can't justify that. Id get the vive pro if I had that kind of cash. Valve index is probably plan B.  Even if it's a beta product for the technology. It shouldn't be that. DK1 sold for 200, rift s is probably 200. Apple is such a weird knesh.
Destroying 3,500 dollars worth of Tech in front of the eyes within 15 minutes... So satisfying
VR sucks. Great vid tho.
Good try, But I’m still want one 😂😂😂
are you postal character voice?
Tears of loneliness destroy a lot of hardware indeed! I just love this man😂
Ok I cried on this teardown poor vision pro😢
Face reveal at 7:50
Can I have this one? :-)
You're the best, keep up the awesome content Jerry
Pro?
trully didint expect to burn so easy
I am so happy you are so successful, I really love your videos and the way you see tech. Just amazing Zack
Oh Man....Not this one
Bro thats expensive
Apple is melting their self
Tears of loneliness - Hits hard, LOL
Should've torn down the battery as well
An almost perfect test, as the anvil test and hydrofluoric acid test are missing.  Finally, freezing the performance result in resin would be a nice touch.
Bravo! Well done!
Bro could NOT wait for the ifixit teardown
They made sure too make more money on repairs then the selling of the product.
"Feels like it's been knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas" in the Jerry voice had me rolling 🤣
Not worth 3500 bucks that’s for sure
This hurt me
Yeah the 7th version of this might be somewhat higher quality instead of plastic lmao
Great ideas on improving accessibility - and I agree, its so important. And especially now that we have a fairly new product category, which seems uniquely positioned to offer a great experience for people with disabilities, it seems like a missed opportunity to not offer more options.
8:11 I hope that was a random, useless key
BRO !!!! Don't this to us .. That feels worse than a breakup !!!
This hurts to watch but not at the same time
❌ be gentle with apple vision pro ✅ Be gentle with apple
couldnt sleep untill i heard "now lets move on to level 8"
I really enjoyed watching this video
Aren't apple not allowed to do the proprietary connecter thing?
Bro it's not for adventure purposes 😢
Only took Apple 5 years to catch up to other companies and release a VR. The market is dying
Garbage product made by garbage company...
i can't see
@a2d soldier 🪖 assamble 🕴️
The non-removable plastic on the glass and plastic lenses on a $3500 device is crazy. Feels like a scam for replacement costs.
It's hard to watch you destroy 3500 dollars worth of tech but it's super interesting at the same time. Next, Linus' Porsche 😂😅😉
Would be nice to see you do the same to meta quest 3 for comparison
This continue to confirm my decision, made years ago, to give Apple and their throwaway products a wide berth.
नमस्कार  🙏🙏🙏
This gentleman has the voice of a calm hypnotist.
"tears of loneliness" is definitely how you will feel as no one will want to be seen with you wearing this on your face. XD
GRACIAS POR MOSTRAR TAN SAGRADO CONTENIDO❤❤
The only time I have not cringed when he ripped apart a piece of tech. I guess I really don't like Apple that much...
I can't for the life of me, figure out why they didnt use gorilla glass or their other special glass on the vision pro. I mean, the damn thing is 3,500. I don't know how or why others aren't talking about this in the comments, most of the comments, especially the top ones are just the regular "Great vid". The bottom cameras are glass but front are not? makes no sense.
Great video and ending is 😂lmao
Oh noooo god please no
He didn't even turn it on to try it 😭
bro just burnt a 3500 headset
MKBHD missed that the cable of the battery pack can be removed using a pin.
This whole video was trigger after trigger.
Apple, please consider discontinuing sales to this individual. Their actions could harm your hardware reputation.😅
There is definitely an apple exec watching this video in terror right now.
And this is how we make a $3500 sleep mask?
+1 for Oasis ref.  😎.   Ready Jerry One...
Unlucky unit of all time 😂
The only slight annoyance with this automation is that you have to swipe left on it at some point in the day otherwise it will send the same message the day after at that time. You can at least hit run without confirmation and decide whether you want it to be daily or weekly.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 me when i see all smartphone dead 😓😓
♥️♥️
zero for repairability, unsurprisingly. e-waste. thanks for the review!
Maybe they should have just made it plastic and saved the weight.
Apple Vision, Apple Vision Pro, Apple Vision Air, Apple Vision Pro Max, Apple Vision (2nd generation)...
I'm not in the target audience, just came for the destruction of that silly ski mask.
You should be able to schedule text messages with the Shortcuts app and use time as the trigger for the automation. Set the action send a message and you can just enter the content of your message and you’re good. With automations on iPhone, you can also schedule text messages based on location like, for example, when you leave work, you can automatically get the travel time from Maps to home and have someone texted how long it will be until you’re home. That’s just one example, but the shortcut app really is very powerful For customization and automation on iPhone.
4 লাখ টাকা জাস্ট 10 মিনিটে নষ্ট করলো। অবিশ্বাস্য।
Been waiting for this ❤
I don't know how many people realize this, but this might be the actual start of the proper public growth of VR headsets. I agree, it is ridiculously expensive, but apple fanboys will be apple fanboys. Next will be the people trying to hang on to new trends, and after that, we get these things everywhere among middle-high end households. VR until now has been decent, but never that "luxurious". Just another piece of tech. The Apple Vision however is a piece of luxury, and a lot of people just simply can't resist owning something that makes them seem more rich than before. This will, however, bring more money into the VR industry, so at least I'm rather happy this exists. VR has a lot more in store in the near future now that Apple of all companies has released something like this.
it’s very pleasant to see that Zack made it fully functional in the end
All my life, I never felt what heartbreak feels like...I got it all from this video 🤣
as a long time VR user, watching you scratch the lenses caused a physical reaction.
yo
“Not designed to be repaired” More the reason for me not to purchase. 🤷‍♂️
So they INTENTIONALLY made the lens of their 3500 dollar product as SCRATCHABLE AS POSSIBLE? Who can actually defend them, I'm pretty sure it's the worst corporation in America.
“This fabric is probably used to clean up Sweat and Tears of loneliness” 😂😂
I’ll be honest sometimes it is painful to watch breakdowns and durability tests , this one is one of them.
scheduled text messages are just a shortcut away boomer
Big thumbs up for wearing it after you tear it off.😂😂
Eyes 👋
Omg 😂 😂 😂 the end of the video was the most beautiful part 😂😂😂
When you were describing the suppleness of the headband I thought you were going to say the loving hands of 1000 Chinese slave children 😅
I can't believe nobody has ever gone skiing with Apple Vision Pro. I think there they are at their maximum utility.🙃
when i look how he destroying  a device, its set me a cry
Now put it back together…. 😅 great video btw
Thieves know your wearing $3,500 on your head.  Expect it to get ripped off your head for a quick score.
Plastic lenses!! That's shocking considering the price.
Now you should return it
😂Holy cow he just destroyed apple vision pro 😅😮 0:41
8:11 Only Fans
3500$ gone just like that  me wanting money in this life
Love it. Same thing I would do if I had one of these. Infact I wouldn't waste my money on any apple technology. 💩
Watching Jerry’s videos, make me feel like a sadomasochist.
The lens being plastic is so embarrassing for a $3,500 headset.
That’s so sauvage
Thermal paste application provided by The Verge, jeez
can't stand this guy!
That razor knife is so strong
I cannot believe that when disconnected, the battery pack uses a lightning connector. Honestly embarrassing
🤡 tech
way to expensive for the normal consumer to afford
This is a new piece of junk soon to be a old piece of junk.
from scratches at level 7 in s24U to this, 2024 seems to be heading in right direction.
So apple is selling us plastic for $3500. Definitely not buying until they advertise properly and readjust price (they’ll most likely won’t do that)
Think about it this way, the first flashlight on a cellphone was in the late 90s. Apple first flashlight was 2010 iPhone 4 ...they hold things off so they can sell it as a upgrade in the future knowing Apple lovers will pay ... Apple sucks and they don't give a F about its customers
front is just "useless" glass
2:32 3500 usd for that 🤡
Apple Vision Pro  Teardown ❌ Breakup ✅
I would love to be a fly on the wall in a manufacturing and engineering team meeting at apple. They probably bring literal pitchforks.
I think all Apple products are too overpriced, but I gotta admit, there´s A LOT of advanced and expensive tech densely crammed in there.
Its depressing to see a guy absolutely destroy something almost nobody can afford. Its kinda interesting the same way a whistelindiesel video hooks you.
Holy shit dude lol
Could you please create a crash test for the Bugatti Chiron?  I am so excited to see how this car performs in burning in the fire
yup, meta quest 3 is better
Me here crying see all things
Meu Jesus, doeu como se fosse o ritual vinking da Águia de Sangue
buy BITCOIN not this junk!
As a glasses dependant VR enthusiast, watching him scratch up the lenses physically hurt me.
I've just discovered expensive ASMR, and it makes me happy
I’m still waiting that is somebody use this Apple Vision Pro like a ski mask for down the hill ⛷️
thank you
I can’t believe they chose plastic on the exterior main glass panel!
Amazing video haha. Maybe by the 5th iteration of this type of product it'll be consumer ready, both in price and functionality.
I was waiting for this teardown. Thank you
he should open his channel sponsor Anker Power Bank too
not worth more than lets say 1500$, but cmon this is apple
I wasn’t gonna buy it anyways but after watching this my metabolism of not buying has increased to 99%
I no longer understand the world. People are celebrated here who willfully destroy values without any sense or connection to reality. Please show me a single person who buys a 3500 USD device, which he wants to use for the purposes for which Apple designed the Vision Pro, and who needs to know what the display looks like when you destroy it with a cutter knife? I would suggest that next time you invest your 3500 USD in a project that really helps people.
Now send it back to guarantee
Look How they massacred My Boy.
You are right accessibility is pretty important for example i have stargardt deslaae and i cant see the exact point im looking and ith the apple vlslin pro you have to look exactly what you want to do 🥲
nice
Not sure what this proves but good work on monetizing while talking shit
More Like Jerry Rigs Apple Stock
Happy to see Anker getting apprciation from everyone around 😌❤️
Love of a thousand grandmas :) :) :)
Part of me thought there's no way you'd break a $3500 product. And I was pleasantly surprised 😅
imagine while using it on driving the apple vison pro jusut started to update its driver  😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am happy with my PICO 4 😉 no thank you apple
The front “glass” is like that for a reason. MKBHD explained it well in one of his videos. I already knew because of that it wouldn’t be that durable. But most people will keep the cover on them anytime they’re not on their heads so it shouldn’t be an issue. These for me are far too expensive for just normal use but these are going to be a game changer for 3D models where companies and engineers can physically see touch and take apart what they’re creating like it’s already been made and is sitting in front of them. I also think this will be amazing for the medical industry as well. Hopefully there’s more competition to create like this in the near future.
This one hurt me
First I saw iFixit's video and then yours. Awesome 😂😂
Absolute carnage
Pour one out for that AVP but thank you for making this! I will definitely make sure to protect the front of mine with its little sock   Being a long time iPhone user, I really want scheduled texts after hearing you talk about it. Part of me thinks maybe I should just write an app 😅
This is 10000x time better than a drop test. Thanks!
Apple is the only company that can put plastic 'screen' on 3,5k product and ask additional 800 for a repair. That is how you become a 4 trillion company I guess.
I am curious, how much that piece of plastic cost ?
You're not allowed to do "the wrist twist" while wearing one of these.
The ending had me dying 😂
This thing is impossible to repair
plastic is plastic and plastic scratches.
Amazing video! FYI, there is accessibility navigation options for the Vision Pro. There’s a function where you can gaze at an item for a few seconds and it will select it for you. Also, if you don’t have fingers or hands I’m pretty sure the device can track your limbs. Along with voice control! I’m unaware of the other accessibility features, but I’m sure there’s some other things like voiceover. 🙂 Hoping they release a physical controller for accessibility at some point.
bruh why would you scratch it, you're putting it your pocket??
Most short lived vision pro 🥹😆
Blud has unsettled beef with apple🙏🏼
I honestly don't undestand why is there a front screen that is showing your eyes, very poorly at that. But if they did decide to make this needless complication, they could have used simple polycarbonate to achieve a 100% safe and translucent outer shell. What is the purpose of the glass/plastic laminate? Makes no sense at all.
I really appreciate Jerry taking the time to remove the screws inside after tearing off the exterior  Nice work I love it
of course im carefully this shit costs me 3500gold bro
You know that guy that gets sober and then has to make that a point in every social interaction? That’s what Zack is like with iPhones to me.
I can only imagine the Apple fan boys watching this and crying 😂
In 2024, Apple brings us the 5th generation of Google Glass. Remember the term glassholes? What will the fanbois wearing this in public be called?
O sea que es imposible que tus ojos se vean desde afuera? O sea lo que vemos desde afuera son una imagen de los ojos de la persona proyectado en una pantalla exterior?
His channel is so simple but so interesting😂. Posted a few hours ago and it’s go 2 millions views 🙀
Am I the only one having diificulty watching this? xD the paaaain
3500 for plastic where 90% of apps dont work.. well.. somebody had to be a pioneer.. right?...right????
3.5K nah fuck it scratch it up and destroy 😢
That product is such a joke!
Its plastic what?
does anyone else spend most of the video with their ears covered repeating no as he scratches shit ... and then wonders what he was saying  ...  but not enough to watch it without covering their ears?
You broke my heart 💔 man scratching that thing, you broke my heart 💔
Apple does have scheduled text messages
Knit by a few thousand Chinese grandmas
Apple fanboys arguing that it's there for some double layer best of both worlds stability to weight ratio bs, guys the purpose of the first and second layer is to create a cool double reflection, thats all.
"iJustine" lmao
you are allah of tech world
He already earned $10k on the views, and still counting... The 3500$ for this piece of crap is nothing to him.
I'd pay money to see Jony Ive reaction to this video. You'd think he'd freak out over the tearing but I don't think so. He'd probably freak over decisions over materials used and black space inside 😅
Love from a thousand grandmas...LOL!
If you think this looks real then your eyes are beyond junk.
Plastic fo 3500 dollars😅 ain't no way they did that
jeez the glasses look better and better... i huess its vloser to being usable
Tears of loneliness... WALL-E & Ready Player ONE vibes 😂 😂
Apples stubborn stance on making everything irreparable is appalling. One of the reasons I'll NEVER return to apple.  From what I have seen so far in regards to this, it's so damned overpriced. But that's apple for ya. Charge through the roof for the name 🙄😅.
Ebay listing, some light scratches :-)
i watch your channel for almost 6 years and just can't belive how cold are your heart to literally destroy theese type of things, literally out of the box,  just to show us how it's inside, and how durable is! Thank you Jerry!
this has to be the most painful video ive ever watched😭
I can't afford that it will take me 5 years to buy this product
there is not even a screen protector on the market
Great video! Such a high priced item, I would not think you would do a tear down of it. But I’m glad you did! Thanks for the great content!
jerry stop ,it already dead😢
Apple literally making jokes about the USB-C Plug 😂 Adding a rotatable Plug and an ultrawide Lightning Cable 😂😂😂
“The love of 1000 grandmas” hahahaha
Man I can smell the burning of solo loop band through your video. Loved it.
Not defending apple but you can sort of increase the battery life by plugging a power bank to the battery via the USB c charging
What are Jerry's friends most terrified of ? -That is nice. Can I have look at it ?
Give me one vision Pro
I Wana buy ur scrap bro
I think I might need some of thar clear rubbery stuff on my sunglasses. I can see how that'd help with my tears of loneliness
Oh man, this should be considered a crime!
on your thumb the black tape = first aid??? U cut yourself off screen?😅
What would you expect for 3500 bucks 😂
Cleaver ! destroying a 3500 $ device and earned so much more than the price
3500€ for plastic lenses is absurd
I would pay to see apple engineers reaction to this video 😂
Vision pro teardown skin when?
Was that a ready player one reference in the end?
You have a heart of iron for sure. These videos are sufficient to keep me sane
This Guy lol🤣😂
You should bring this to the apple store and say you fell down stairs
You make apple products useless and worthless and that is what it becomes recently!
This guy literally destroys something worth my entire compound
WOW i will love to see this thing is burning at 3000°C
I am just half way through the video and the vision pro already looks like some item found in a plane wreck!
Apple can make the most amazing hardware you have ever seen, but the fact that they go way beyond reason to make everything disposable and absolutely impossible to repair should hurt then badly
Simplemente Genial jaja
I think a laminate with the plastic outside is a really bad choice for a device like that. Either give it a replaceable plastic outer, or a scratch resistant glass outer. But this has the worst of both worlds.
JUNK. This thing is a bag of crap.
Anyone else can't stand the scratching sound?
Zach ripping the thing to shreads and explaining how it work while Apple designer and engineers are dying while watching this happen😅😅😅.
After watching him destroy so pieces of tech so mercilessly I thought my heart had hardened enough but no this video made me feel the same pain I felt the first I watched his video. Thanks for making me feel something again.
It looks strange to destroy such expensive glasses, I feel sorry for a 4 year old phone to destroy 😂😂😂
This channel must be shut down, banned from YouTube...
im supersized they were still willing to put in another proprietary connector after the whole thing with EU and usb c
Like the Barbie song! "Life in plastic, it's fantastic!"
2M views in 12 hours.... he can buy 10 of these now!
Scratching aluminum is like nails on a chalkboard.
Awesome internals…. But wow, they really cheated the outside of this unit
What an Apple fanboy's nightmare is made off.
What's even the point of having glass underneath the plastic if the outside scratches easily because of the plastic? It just means that it can shatter if you hit it hard enough that the plastic isn't enough to protect it.
How on earth did they make this thing….
WOW Its amazing how you destroyed this.
I can excuse the plastic front panel, glass would be super heavy but plastic eyepieces? Anyone who's ever used fpv goggles of VR knows that they get dirty very quickly and you'll be cleaning them often. Any scratches that close to the eyes will appear massive and completely ruin the view.
Everything is plastic bud!! Just bought a new vac, almost all plastic !! Meh, like any piece of expensive equipment you gotta take care of it
This part 4:18 sent shivers down my spine.
yapple vision pro
Don't cut yourself bud
Marques said it was glass... too funny
they could use the sounds from the razor against aluminum as an advanced interrogation technique
Wrist click might be an issue on some sites .. 🤔 savages.  Lots of technology for the price imho.
So, it's unrepairable by user and it uses proprietary port for external battery.  EU will rip Apple to pieces for that. Apple have the money, but EU has the legislative power.
Watching you scratch the Vision Pro feels like u are scratching my soul. For context in South Africa it would cost just over R66 000 for the base model. Thats like 9 months rent
Déjà remboursé avec le nombre de vue
The way I’m crying
He’s FOS
The fact that this glasses are meant not to be repairable fades off my probablility of buying them...
Don’t let it until it’s soul comes out 😂😂😂😂
does apple care cover this damage?
because apple glass is known for being sturdy anyways ... 🤣 if its apple you must treat it like an infant ...
WHY would you do this? It's just beyond me that there exists a channel where stuff is destroyed. Good job, you're contributing a lot to society.
Hey Jer Bear i just had an idea. Can you STOP STABBING YOURSELF!
This is so difficult to watch!  Oh my God!
The test no one needed but everyone still watched
3500dollars? ok its good video
Tears of loneliness 😂
I’m not sure Jerry appreciates how difficult it would be to make this “repairable”. You would have to sacrifice weight, size, aesthetics, water ingress protection, and more. And they’d do that on every single product knowing 1 in 100 are going to actually try to repair it…
Side speakers. You didn’t mention those.
The anker battery pack can also absolutely overheat your iPhone, degrading the battery to your satisfaction over time!
The same company that brought you "sapphire" on their phones and watches, now bring you "glass" on their AR/VR headset.
i start watching your video.and with the first coment i stop right there,how can you how can you judge something that you don't even see yet???so you don.t deserve that i spend one more second o my time watching this
Pretty cool technology. Definitely gotta flip that front glass around so that the durable part is on the outside, not sure what they were thinking there.
He needed that sponsorship for this one…
there are more sustainable ways of testing devices tho
1. It's OK for a greedy company to release a good product. 2. It's NOT ok for a greedy company to charge unnecessary high prices for a product (no matter how awesome/ground breaking it is). 3. 2:13 - This part made me start to cringe...but I'm ok with it.
God of destruction 🙌🏻
2.1 mil views in 14hrs is crazy
I would rather buy an apple to eat than a product from them
"help keep moisture, makeup, sweat, and tears of loneliness from entering" had me
My anker 20000mah Power bank can double the power of yours
that wrist flick 😅
$3500.00 and plastic lenses I'm disappointed !!!
Plastic lens and outer glass for 3.5k 💀
watching that really hurts !!!
Hope he got apple care
hello sir please as you have destroyed it are you gonna give it away  or sell it i am interested location should not a problem
" Don't worry, my patience is immeasurable". Wow I love that line.😂
The meta vision quest, i mean apple
"Tears of loneliness" :D
rip
A thousand grandmas 😂
"knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas" haha love it
Apple had to know you’d get your hands on this to fully test this. That scratch test is just wild
I was asking if bro is gonna tear this up too😅
Waiting on our order like… 😂👀
This hurt watching this wonderful technology being destroyed
3500 and a plastic outer screen... Wow
$3500, can't afford to make the front panel glass.
The ol' electrical-tape-over-the-cut trick, ey?
All this time I thought Jerry was speaking was recording 😭
Why the fake vocal affectations? That isn't your natural voice.
We'll  it's still working at the end😂
3500 bucks ? Have they gone insane ?
Not surprising that Apple decided to have an easily scratchable 'glass' front piece. How else is their business supposed to have a constant income stream after their customers already pay premium price for their premium products?
Step away from the fabric lol
How many months till Xiaomi copies this and sells it for 600 dollars 😂😂
haaa haaaa
An Apple product whose quality doesn't warrant the price? Say it ain't so!
Plastique on the front make sens, it's like glasses nowadays glasses are not made with real glasse but with plastique.  Like that if ever you have a fall with them glasse will not shatered anywere especially near you eye same thing goes for the headset
the sound of scratching this physically hurts me.
He definitely a Meta Quest 3 - Fan
Seems like @AppleTrack got to this before you did
Finally satisfied 😊
Nicely done!
the upper plastic-glass window could be well polished 🤔
9:20 im waiting for level 10
4:19 i have headphones on, i hated every second of that
Between you and MKBHD we can get a critical view of what was uncriticizeable before. Thank you for doing the unthinkable!
Hopefully 20years from Now JRE will do a scratch text on AI robots...
The fact it scratches so easily is probably it’s biggest problem, for the price it’s not worth the risk of purchasing knowing that reason
how to waste $3500 in 20 minutes
I dont want 1 dont like apple at all, but this video hurt my soul 😢.
The dude makes money destroying Apple stuffs! 😂
Best video I've seen from you yet! Loved the teardown!
Designed to not be fixed,,,,,
Destruiu um Palio em 13 minutos! kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
People eyes are gonna be so fucked going forward
Using plastic for a $3500 device is WILD! Really disappointing. I expected Gorilla Glass or at least regular glass because it's not like people are gonna drop it easily since it's not supposed to be held with one hand like phones.
Jerry got Robbed
Everyone is wearing them now with this weather. I really want to see everyone wear them in the summer.
thats 4 k bills !!!!! , food for  7 months
bro dont give a fuck about the price'
I use usb-c for pcvr regularly i dont see why they couldnt use one for this.
Tears of loneliness 😂😂
don't even think about buying it, got it
ifixit have got lazy...
Nooooooooooooooooooooo hahahahaha
Give me one🥲🥲
“ knitted from the love of 1000 grandmas”
Can I have your broken Vision Pro 😢
Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas is my new favorite saying
3:25 My Macbook Air M1's display would've costed me slightly more if I had bought the Apple Care package. Weird but true.  Edit: Because Apple care was too costly when I had purchased the laptop, almost 40% of the selling price.
Maybe Apple Care is useful if you are clumsy AF and break the glass more than once? Two glass replacements without Apple Care would cost 1600, but with Apple Care would cost 1100, and it gets even more convenient yf you break it a 3rd time lol
its always painful watching you destroy electronics but its also too interesting to not watch
Not having glass on a screen is just fine on a fold, where it is normally protected by itself, and you get, well, a fold in return. On something you'll comonly slamm into walls, shelves and the like, it is a ******* disgrace.
Man, that was worth my 7 months of rent :p
Bruh watching it getting destroyed slowly and deliberately really hurts
Thanks Zack! I was told you already shown what happens when you continued the scratch tests to see what would happen and now I know! Thanks for "experimenting" on things so I don't have to. Also since I watch your videos I always use razorblade and scissors to show my relatives that they should not worry about the screen getting scratched by keys or sth :D They always get a fright tho :)
I'm to poor to buy a vision pro 😢 but you got plenty of $ to waste on the vision pro just to damage it.   Can you donate one to me. 😁
Why would he just buy this and start dismantling it? Why do YouTubers do these dumb stuff ? I really wanna know? For views or what?
правильно молодец, что сломал
holy s*th man
Thanks, Jerry ❤
Another overpriced POS made by Apple. $500 for AppleCare to cover this plus an additional $300? They aren't gonna repair the glass, they are just gonna replace your unit with a refurbished or a new one since it just came out.  Which means this thing is literally only worth about $1000.  But is the $3500 price justified?  Let's see:  The screens are basically 2 4ak displays only smaller. The lowest price 4K TV you can get that would be very nice would be about $350. But we already know Samsung QHD+ displays in their phones costed Apple for the iPhone X, about $110.  Aluminum is cheap so the casing is not expensive, so iys obvious you're paying for what is inside.  Samsung, LG and BOE all have the ability to make bendable glass. So why didn't Apple pay one of them to put Gorilla Glass on the outside? Using plastic is lMe for $3500.  The SoC? Well if I use Intel as a marker for price, it costs Intel approx $50 in materials to make a chip that they will sell for about $500. So the markup on chip is always ridiculous.  Feom reviews the OS j side is basically iPad OS with a frosted translucent look.  Comparing this to Microsoft's Hololens headset, both are very expensive and really isn't made for the consumer.  Doctors and scientist can sure use this to virtually see things that maybe your eyes would miss. And certainly people in those fields of work can certainly afford it.  But at this price, co sidelong it's limited capability, it's just an overpriced toy.  This videos screams, "hey look at me I'm so rich I can destroy a $3500 product and not care".  I can't believe idiots actually stood in line to buy this.   I have my clock set, I am willing to bet by summer you won't even be getting much about this product because the novelty at the consumer level is gonna wear off very fast.   You couldn't even give me one of these. After trying Oculus and Samsung VR headsets, I just don't think at the consumer level this is a viable or sustainable product.  The fact that the visor on the outside damages so each means even carpet fibers if you drop it, will leave permanent scuff marks. I guess it won't matter as long as you don't plan to use them to look arms real objects. But that's the thing, it can look outside and see real objects. So if you gets scratches or scuffs over the cameras, guess what?!  I hope someone compares the quality of this thing to Microsoft's existing product.  I see them both as a joke.  Overpriced tech toys that fool buy because they have the jack to waste.  If I wad gonna blow $3500 on something, I'd rather buy a overpriced $3500 diamond ring that I could resell for more than I paid vs buying this.😅
wait so the front screen is glass but the glass is covered with plastic so if something scratches the screen the glass wont protect it how does that make sense to them when they designed it
This channel is the tech version of horror movies
I’m gonna buy 2 of these things. Wow!
Pity glasses, they wanted to be glad to user.
always statisfying with the speakin and scratching&destroying
Only in America, good job 🎉🎉🎉
Scheduled text messages are a thing on iPhone
This was painful and fascinating! Thanks for the detailed teardown. What’s inside is just as amazing as what it can do
$3500 "glass" turd
I can't decide if I like the iFixit teardown or this one better. Both are highly entertaining ways to see what's inside.
cant wait for it to start dying suspiciously around the time that a newer expensive version comes out
LOL Apple care is not a good deal on anything that Apple provides. It borders on scam. Also "No USB could handle the movement" You even tried other VR headsets? Plastic lenses and having the balls to charge 3.5k for it.
nonsensical price 3.5k and this is their first apple vision pro. imagine in the future probably 10k.   apple can ask nonsense prices but still their customers buy.
Embarrassing for Apple.
not sure why youtubers destroy tech with scratch test - you could feed a family for a month with $3500
Oh my! That can definitely get damaged with scratches
Now put it back!
Jesus Christ you destroy it like isn't 3500 USD
That last scene of you recreating every youtuber reviewer but with a broken ipro haha
This is so hard to see.
Man I hope you never go to any apple products, apple should loose all of there customers to android. They're greedy, selfish and you never really own your devices with apple. Don't get me wrong, I like apple products but I hate apple business practices.
😂😂😂
More disposible crap
him destroying the vision pro gave me a sense of pleasure i didn't think i was capable of experiencing
يا اخي حرام عليك عطني الجهاز او الفلوس 😢😢😢
Seems that Zack never tried Quest 3...
No one:  Me: 👃 smelling the fumes 😹
Looks like its unrepairable
$3,500 for plastic junk?  No thanks.  Who would buy this?
So it did go back together?
NOW YOU ARE THE MOST CURSED PERSON ON THE PLANET, HUMINATY HAVE EVER SEEN
bought it, tried it, then thought to himself, “yea time to destroy it”
Ready player one looking headset I actually like the design (I hate saying that as well)
What a piece of junk! $3500 dollars! That is ridiculous! Dude apple got those kids in the swear shops working overtime on this crap lol! I still cant believe how much both screens got damaged from light use! More like $3.50 for this lol!
The Fact of Never cleaning the desk after destroying expansive stuff, making it more terrifying for new coming devices. Premium horror crime scene 😄

Before he uses the heat gun there's no bandage on his thumb, after he uses the heat gun there's a bandage on his thumb and he still cutting towards himself.
Bend test great😂 can you do same on cyber truck😂😂😂
I can hear Tim crying
Apple is better than android
Im in pain
Wonderful engineering
Can someone get this man’s thumb some help??? 😂
Oh god, how are you going to make the money back from the damage
To be fair, the top vr headsets are made the same. They just aren't horribly overpriced and can do way more than this waste of money c
The design inside look way better than the snowboard visual outside, wtf
Thank goodness theirs more than one layer of glass
Why jerry why😅🫣
Why did you think it will flop
Over 1 thousand apple sheeps crying he hates the build quality :Ddddddddddddddddddddddd
$800 for plastic , probably state the vision pro is made from 80% recycled material to try & justify the price
Community note: The Apple Vision Pro screen is in fact glass. Not plastic as claimed the video. It features a plastic overlay on the exterior surface, similar to that of car window screens, to stop shards of glass escaping and going in the users eyes in event of an accident
😂😂😂 really painful to watch
To Painful to Watch 😂
I hope you have apple care
Full satisfied 🖖🏻
WhistlinDiesel is the car version of JerryRigEverything. Durability testing EVERYTHING they like until it breaks. Truly satisfying.
i wonder why they didnt license face tracking 3d display tech from nintendo
Keys? Coins? It's not a phone. This thing isn't going in anyone's pocket. The surface is also not used for interfacing with the device, so it doesn't impact usability. It's just cosmetic. I agree it's too easily scratched, but how is someone going to scratch it in the first place?
Scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4? Wow what a great year, new scratch level every week 🤣
woulda loved if he ended it with putting it back together to see if it ever boots
Apple collectively entered a fetal position when they heard Zac was going to be testing the durability of this. edit: maybe a dbrand skin for the front that is the inside of the unit.
DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUS. BUT Someone from apple want to know your location {if you  know you know}
the oasis reference🔥
Apple said let's see how many suckers give us $3500 + for this thing lmao
Junk
I was curious about what was inside that battery
The engineering is insane.thumbs up for that👍
It's so obvious it's fake. Wait, do I have the glasses on?
The cut in his thumb makes me think that   He is a a TECH VIKING
This video was like How to Basic for electronic techs!
We get it why the channel is named jerryrigEVERYTHING
Apple tardo años en desarrollarlos y Jerry los hizo pelota en 13 minutos jajajaja
you missed OIS check😅
the inner lenses are plastic?? wow cheap.
That's satisfying..
Apple fooled us, again 😂
with the laminate being this soft it can be polished like the phones screens from back in the day!
Who doesn’t enjoy scratched glasses? 🙃
So then after, you're reassembling it, right? RIGHT?
*tears of loneliness* lmao
BUT EVEN WITH APPLE CARE I GOT BAMBOOZLED BY MOH'S HARDNESS SCALE.
Honestly would you guys rather have higher quality materials that cost as much as the device itself just to fix, or some cheap plastic that isn't going to shatter if you trip or drop the thing?
$ 3,500 dollars Gone, just like that.😭
Painfully satisfying🫠
After watching this video, I decided not to buy this gadget, no plastic devices resist at home 😂
Did he really bandage himself with some kind of a tape? Before 6:40 his right thumb was kind of injured (even before this film)? And after that he used a tape ;-;?
Anyone else gets the same feeling as nails on chalkboard when he scratches the aluminum?
"knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas".  That's  one of the best quotes from a sort of review i have ever heard.
Unique review always fan of calm and full if patience Jerry Rig Everything 🫡🫡❤️❤️❤️
Right to jail! Do not pass Go, nor collect 2000. Right away.
so its safe to say there will be no teardown and rebuild it video ? 🤣
why in gods name did they not just use solid plastic on the outer shell?  This now has all the disadvantages of plastic combined with the disadvantages of glass...engineering fail.
Why did you scratch it so much? XD
😢
wating for version 4 now is just prototype
"articulatable" hmmm lol nice!!
5:45 what a butcher!
This guy is a certified apple hater
The Grand Canyon level grooves
Meanwhile I'm saving 1$/ month to get get one some day😅
I'm scared of imitating what you do, without the income and sponsors you do
Am I the only one who noticed the ready player one reference at the end
colab with dbrand for it!
Not that you’ll see my comment, but your last comments on higher SCI not being able to use it is so true.. I’m a C5 and can’t use my fingers and that’s the only reason I’m not going to buy one unfortunately :/
Theres two reactions: People are in pain that such expensive tech is being torn apart or there satisfied that such expensive tech is being torn apart.
RIP 🪦 Apple Vision Pro
"The rubber seal prevents sweat and/or tears of loneliness from getting inside."  LOOOOOOOOOOL

Tyle pieniędzy za plastik 😂  współczuję tym co kupią to gówno 😂😂
fine tech with outdated chipset and playstation vr build quality for 3.5K only Apple could pull out something like that
it hurts my soul to watch him destroy this knowing i want to try it. But knowing im not paying 3500 for it lol.
Plastic lenses??!! What the fuck, Apple??!! I never had and will never have anything from Apple, but still, this is just wrong.
jerry bro last thing was the most funniest thing i ever saw😂😂
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😰😰😨😨😱😱😱😱
… knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas 😂😅😊
s24 lädt doch nur mit 25w und plus und ultra laden mit 45w
every time i see someone using one i think of mr pink playing the worlds smallest violin.
Irreparable como todo lo de apple
I don’t think I’ve laughed so much while watching a tear down video lol great stuff man! Love it
I don't know it's my poor status or rig is so rich to tear anything 😂
This is the 2nd scenario where I justify buying this. I will give props to apple for the level of innovation in the hardware but it’s still way ahead of its time and it’s still useless, not to mention non repair friendly. Doesn’t justify its price, a price of which is mostly driven by greed. So all in all, I’ll never support this product until it’s actually worth something and provides something viable over its competition.
nice
it takes two years of my salary to buy one even if i start to save money now it will be outdated by then
The love of 1000 grandma's, when the love of one is overwhelming 🥺❤️
Incredible waste of money confirmed!
You just nailed it. It's the real durability test now..😂😂😂❤
And Tesla CyberTruck Durability Test when????
Have you learned the special vr apple fan boy gesture?  Make a vertical fist in front of your body, open it to make a circle with you thumb and forefinger.  Move it rapidly up and down.
Beautiful as usual
RIP, Apple Vision Pro, thanks Jerry its a terror movie
"feels like its been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas"  unfortunately it was probably knitted with the tears of a thousand sweatshop workers
Were you ever disabled or care for someone disabled?
Sentí dolor y curiosidad al mismo nivel
Android Guy, Apple hater
$800 for a piece of laminated glass 😂 Bravo, Apple.
This video deals 1d6 psychic damage every 12 seconds.
Wait, you can't schedule a text message on the Iphone?
Hey @JerryRigEverything, do you have much knowledge of how to allow charging of a meta quest 2 headset while plugged in to a pc? im getting fewer and fewer hours as my battery gets older and i want to have charging as i use it. or perhaps a device that can attach to the battery terminal inside the headset and charge on a seperate line?
Imagine combining this with a Neuralink-chip implanted in the brain. Someone without any movement capability could experience the world like a fully functional human being.
Even after all these years, the sound of the knife across the aluminium gets me every time
iPhone has shortcuts that allow for tons of phone automation including scheduling texts. Android users are losers
Thank u Jerry
1:18 You're probably right albeit the grandmas are sitting in a crowded sweatshop.
Do you ever clean your desk?
And whats going to happen now to this Vision Pro? Will you just salvage its internals as replacements or just sell it as it is?
Apple does apply a lot of thermal paste. That's weird. They should cheap out on that stuff. They always cheap out on sth.
somehow this is very painful to look at :C
Tears of loneliness 😂
Mus install protective film asap
Some losers put themself in debt just to buy this thing to"Show off" to people and here's Zack destroying it.
Every eye opened wide to view the tech tear down by Jerry rig....   Plastics throughout for a 3500 tech. May be to make Lesser weight.
All the sweatshops and people still got scammed. 😂😂😂 Clown world.
This man don’t play when long-last testing these products - lol what next ? Will it survive a drop from the roof of a sky scraper ? Lol 🤷‍♂️🤪👍
The front screen is completely unnecessary and adds weight and cost
greasy fingers no white glove 💯 fail
Bro why are you rigging everything. Give it to somebody that can’t afford it like me 😢
9:25 holy cow there really is glas!
@09:08 why i don't use level 9, well let me show, not on a cheap product but on this most New Expensive Product :D
these folks realy try hard to get rid of remaining lightening cabels they even try to hide them from youwhat a garbage
🤣"The love of a thousand grandmas" got me!
I fully agree with him - iPhone needs scheduled text messaging! It’s the only android feature I envy 😂
Unrepairable,  for the worth of 3500$ to be used in just minutes/hours to be Unrepairable now.  so i guess Apple is for Rich person but no worry competition is Healthy. lets wait for other competitor with Repairable 3500$ or lesser amount with almost same value.
The kid in an apple sweat shop watching this after getting paid 3¢ for a hard days work 👁️👄👁️
The only 2 problems with this device is  1. it's an Apple product 2. it's an Apple product
That repair cost will be a full unit replacement rather than repair, if it’s anything like the iPad repair process
11:24
i hate and love u at the same time, pls stop destroying stuff😂😂😂😂😂
now other headsets? xD
3500 for what??? A bunch of low quality plastic made in china.  MetaQuest 3 cost 600-700 and is way better in most aspects.
There's a reason why this guy is one of the best YouTubers and this video just proves it.
the "glass" is a huge disapointment
Why do I feel so sad 😢
DUDE!! I've watched a few of your things but watching you destroy that stupid thing so calmly and matter of fact ly has made you a new permanent fan! Awesome, hilarious, and of course ..... educational.
4:25 so pain
ouch
I tested this my friend got one and its about the same as my quest 3 (the pass thru camera a bit better but that about it) even the interface is basically the same. So quite overpriced as usual from apple. My friend will return it and get a quest 3 instead lol.
1:18 more like with the hands of 1000 chinese kids
nice
Push back on apple and ask them to point out where the actual glass is on the front. And how the fuck do they think it’s ok to ship a flammable head band?
The aluminum seems to be the sole reason of the sturdiness. Well-played Apple.
Can I have it now 🥹😢
😎
When you wipe your phone's screen to realise there's a spot on his impeccable white table. 😂😂😂 😅
This Video hurts my soul..... So painful to watch 😢
A crappy plastic vr pc for 3500$😂😂😂
I've put it in my microwave 750w 1min and the 'glass' melted!
Thumbs up to jerry for including durability and teardown in a single video unlike others making tons of content(video) just on a single product ( you know who )
He already made the profit
HAHAHA THERER WE GOOOO
bro your channel is BOOMING i remember watching you back in the day, when the new iphone 10 had come out and stuff like that, you're still ripping, 8.5 mil subs, and all your videos get more than 1 2 million views. well deserved man
I want to watch Tim Cook watching this video
I'm probably never going to buy this unless I'm filthy rich but seeing the amount of tech that's been shoved into this thing boggles my mind. It's actually pretty cool. Just wish it didn't cost almost as much as my car's down payment.
I will never buy this
I'd really like to see the speakers inside
WHYYY😢
Apple is a disgusting company full of scams
me too i'm a big android and pc consumer but this VR is dope, first time i ever get the idea of : "damn that's a nice bit of hardware" when it comes to apple product.
this is the most painful durability test I've seen yet
It's a very interesting new toy.😍
I am very anti-Apple but watching you scratch up the surface of this very expensive piece of tech hurts my soul.
I started blowing at my screen after he accosted me with those toxic fumes. 😄
قلبي الصغير لا يتحمل 😢
As if i didnt already have enough reasons not to buy apple products lmao. What a piece of crap
Holy shit. This thing is seriously 3.5 grand???
At this point, Jerry is delivering worthy of his name. Ripping every piece with no hope of fixing. Only place left for that vision pro is in junk
1:10 try out a dog/cat carrying pouch-sling. Those are even softer.
🫠😢😢😂😂💕💕
:0
I am never buying that garbage.
This degree a non reparability is astonishing no wonder the display cost so much... And the fabric which doesn't seems to be ignifuged for that kind of prices, it's crazy...
It annoys me that so many people are writing "ngl" and saying "not gonna lie" as if it adds any meaning. Just stop it already!
10:15 make me feel 😬 grrrrrr
“Apple says there are 23 million pixels”. Ok, let’s count them all!
Psycho of the year 😮😮😮
I commend him for sacrificing $4000 on the Altar. The real question here is how many of these did he take apart.
I'll pray for everyone's therapy 🙏🏻😢
So that means the cameras, circuit-boards, chips and screen are basically a full-fledged gaming rig's worth? I mean, since the housing is all plastic, which is negligible in value.
This is so much expancive
I love how he totally destroy the gadget i cant afford🥰
The front glass is likely covered with scratch prone plastic for the planned obsolescence. Trendy peeps cannot be seen rocking a scratched up Apple Vision... Gotta buy a new one ever year or so...
Ouch
Its already dead please stop😂
Can you do the Quest 3 please?
Imagine who got to test these before release...
once this will be glasses sized I'll get into it, but this is still too big
The last part was very funny man😆
Apple: lied about the usage of glass Me: what a suprise
Thank you for setting it on fire on behalf of all android users 🤣🤣💀
I can only imagine all the Apple fanboys loosing it after watching this video xD
this is actually painfull to watch. but i love it
overpriced piece of junk for fanboys..
12:56 "That didn't come in the box" that was PERSONAL
Apple’s Brand Marketer’s must be raging by now
Okay now to get famous i just need to buy a vision pro and…. Oh… oh no….
Aye,
He just keeps scratching…..
😅🤣😂to
the heart of this computer is just beautiful.
Nice 👍🎉
u should open and show the battery too
Tears of loneliness
Crazy man, respect!!!
This tech is $3500 *lights on fire with $3 Bic lighter
😅🤑
I have tears of loneliness. Guess that means I can buy one now.
This and Musks neuro chip is just moving us closer to the "eyephone" from Futurama
Honestly, I don't think repair-ability is really a notable item here Zach. I wouldn't take this apart to repair it anymore than I would my Canon L glass lenses or camera bodies. They're professional tools that require precision equipment to work on and generally cost quite a bit to repair ($500 to have a small amount of sand removed from my 100mm-400mm lens last year). This is pretty much the same ballpark.   Most people could probably repair a phone fairly easily, but this is in another league and I think we should give Apple some credit for innovation :)
Every video just breaks my heart:)
Oh my goodness!  I feel shivering to watch this video.
$3500 wasted 😂
Can we get a quest 3 tear down
@jerryrigeverything  With your Jerry rig knives, can you add a hex bit holder on it? Like a standard 1/4" hex bit holder and a micro hex bit holder for precision bits? It would be very helpful to have a flip out hex bit holder to use it as an "emergency" screwdriver for small AND standard size screws.   Just a thought.
3500 for a plastic "glass" 🤣😂
That was painful to watch
That's why I can't take some tech reviewers seriously sometimes. You're the first one of 4 major tech channels I've visited that explained that the battery is in fact 36Wh and charges with a higher output than phones when many have wondered why it was only 3166mAh. I mean, it's literally written there... And it doesn't seem that surprising when it's powering two chips, one of them an M3 soc, two fans, 3 screens and a lot of cameras.
I have seen so much of it and no matter what positive things I hear people say I still cannot fathom why this would be something people would want to buy considering it does not seem to offer much more than other headsets that cost a fraction of this.
11:33 a☠️
I can’t watch this. And still here I am.
i was expecting ART CLASS WITH JERRY when the front is easy to scratch :(
Some apple engineers somewhere are having nightmares after seizures this "controlled" disassembly 😂😂
Can you plug that lighting cord into any external battery or only that one?
$3499! Bwahahahaha!
The moment he started scratching the lenses, after he burned the head strap made me lose my shit
Omg jerry never disappoints 😂😂😂 great work of commentary
Looking at you scratching that making my heart ache😢😢
That's right! destroy that schizophrenia simulator!
Holy smoke It's been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas!! got me there 😅
"Knitted by a thousand loving grandmas"... or a kid in a factory in china...
So satisfying 😂😂😂 you destroyed this 😂😂😂😂
Noooooooooooo
This thing should be "Gameboy" level indestructible for the price😂
4:51 Scratches on the exterior can most definitely affect the viewing experience when they're in front of one of the cameras.
It's painful and intriguing at the same time seeing the destruction...
Bro is the ultimate apple hater behind parker🤣🤣🤣
I don't know whats more brutal in JRE videos, the scratches and the bends or the slow jabs at apple.
Apple really makes me mad... plastic... the same company who used 6 series aluminum because they were to cheap to use 7 series on their phones- and then when they bent thought a glass backing was a good idea which ultimately ended other competitors robust frame design with durable and flexible polycarbonate backing that was removable to be able to swap out batteries.  I hate apple, everything from 600 wheels to plastic on a 4k dollar attempt at a glorified VR headset... it never stops and because of cheasy marketing to the ignorant the sheap continue to multiply...
Am I the only one who see Robocop resemblance when Jerry wears the Vision Pro
Instead of buying this nonsense I purchased Salesforce stock and any crypto that is AI or web 3. You can make good money
“Tears of loneliness” , well said.
Of all the reviewers, the Vision Pro looks best on Zack. 😎
Yazik gunah be usta
Really ... People dying to buy the Apple Vision Pro.. but you are destroying it for YouTube content.
jerry end everything with a snap
nonsense tests
We wouldn't be upset if you wore gloves bro.  We don't need a guy that makes wheelchairs for people getting hand cancers.
If you don't care about the front screen a dbrand skin with only holes for the camera and sensors would be great scratch defense.
$3500 seemed overkill to me, and after this video I think its even more overpriced
The idea of this device is cool. But I can't get behind this thing being used in public, people walking in it on the streets or God forbid,driving. There is enough accidents now with just regular phones, I can't imagine people walking in this watching YT or Netflix. This is a start to some cyberpunk shit.  Anyways, as long as such device is not produced by other companies with better support, I'm not touching it with a stick. Apple is the most consumer unfriendly company with overpriced products in the world.
You should do a review of the ps vr2
I’ll sorry but I pass, life is too beautiful to get stuck with a device in front of your eyes and have more antisocial activities….I don’t see any benefit to have it apart from watching videos all day.
He's probably the first person who destroyed an apple vision pro
Destroys a $3500 Apple Vision while wearing a $10 Casio Watch 😂
Jerry, I think you made Tim Apple queezy with this durability test.
6:40 seems that JerryRigKnife made its way to JerryRigThumb.
I would love to see all the phones that you broke for the past videos as one episode show us where you keep all this Missy 😂
Why not move most of the hardware (processors and other chips + fans) to the battery as well??... this would mean much lighter and more comfortable wearpiece....
Seems like such a waste to destroy something so expensive. The energy and the effort put into producing it and shipping. It is all wasted.
Setting fire to the yarn knitted by a thousand Grandmas was brutal 😭
Too expensive.. dont even worth the money
tears of loneliness 🥲🥲 5:47
Getting through half of the video, but still, this is the biggest trauma I have had this year so far. I hope it remains that way.
Apple could sell a piece of dog crap and people would still buy it.
Watching this was so painful, but yet satisfying😂
Did you saw the new screw inside of the Apple Vision Pro ?
I wonder how many Apple fanboys fainted, watching this?
8:08 You can do scheduled texts with apple shortcuts, can you not?
I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared of a tear down video before
just gonna keep waiting for meta quest pro 2, also very sad that you still sponsor anker, but ill just let them keep paying u and not buy anything
If this goes wireless  It’s over for us 💀
😂 an orwellian product that deserves it.
I'm realizing Jerry has my child dream job, I simply destroyed everything electronic I had. :D
Why not do the Quest 3?
I am not an Apple fan but when Zach ripps everything it's just satisfying  I wonder if Tim Cook watches this? I would love a peep in his office when they say Zach has ripped the $3500 Vision Pro😂🤣 Respect!
nervegear v1.0 build os 10242004
Lol gtfo 800 to replace the "glass" piss off apple
who is buying this crap
@jerry take a look at Dwell Control and Pointer Control to assist with you accessibility needs. You’ll find things there that will assist with your limited finger functionality needs. ❤
When a Gen 1 unopened Vision Pro sells for 10 million in 10 years... there may be some regrets 😂
I don't know how he could not find a way to send scheduled text messages 😂 maybe does not knows about the shortcuts app😅
Why am i the only person that finds the knife scratching insane
apple is garbage for a long time
Thought I’d hate this but you brought up a lot of good points and it’s crazy the screen replacement costs that much
The review we never thought we needed but the review we wanted is finally here!
To think people will buy this shit is just hilarious and sad at the same time.
Okay now put it back together 😅
OUCH! ...That was truly cringe-worthy! Like watching a car crash video in slow motion, I couldn't stop watching even as I wanted to turn away. I was left with two competing impressions: 1) what a gawd-awful repair process for this product; 2) wow, there is so much cool tech packed packed into this thing. I want to say thanks, but I still feel queasy.
Simultaneously satisfying and soul destroying.
sooo can it still be repaired after all that?
Ah, another dose of Apple destruction to keep me healthy and happy
The tearing of this ultra expensive device makes me puke
The font is glass someone broke it on another video I and it shattered at 10 m
The word glass is doing alot of heavy lifting here thats the best review comment ever 😂😂
3500 dollars and you can’t even get a glass screen, absolute ripoff
The EU - Apple that's enough of your crap - usb-C your devices  Apple: Makes new class of device outside the legislation and showers it with proprietary connections 😂😂
I'm surprised by how flammable it is
He gotta test the quest 3 and/or the quest pro now....
Zeiss lenses made of plastic??? Vtf...
Tell me, like for real: What is this product more than a luxurious travel media device (rather than using an iPad for example) and an expensive Macbook accessory that gives you a "virtual bigger screen" (in the few cases you can't have a physical extra/bigger screen) with option to have some additional apps on the side (which you could also do with your phone)?  I'm not saying it's useless; it sure is "cool tech" and maybe "fun" for an hour or two; but to my understanding it's useful to VERY FEW people and a REASONABLE PURCHASE for even less. But then again: people nowadays aren't very logical thinking or reasonable, it's more about "flex" for most.  I've got the money, but I will definitely NOT make this purchase. Maybe the 2nd or rather 5th generation 😅🤦🏼‍♂️
Each cut costs $100
Companies get away with whole plastic screens at inner sections of foldables these days so I'm not surprised there's no secure option provided with outer display of this btw you don't have to touch it on a daily basis like those foldable screen which get damage from your fingernails too
Amazing lamineted glass technology, wonder why they dont just use regular glass instead?> $$$$
I really appreciate Jerry taking the time to remove the screws inside after tearing off the exterior Nice work I love it
مجنون ذا😂
What if bro forgot to record
That 1st scratch was enough for me to say NOPE!! ty cause that proved to me that this is indeed just a beta build for something that will be good in maybe 5-10 years but, today this is a waste of $ especially w/ the bad build quality and battery life.
When Mr Jerry rigs Apple stuff which are unnecessarily hyped My inner self: 😂😂😂 Total Satisfaction😊
AHHHHHH DONT DESTROY THE VISION PROOOOOOOOOO
Zack is Master Oogway in commentary while being a Hulk in action.
These videos are always simultaneously satisfying and painful
Imagine just ripping $3500 with one hand and no effort? Make effort apple.
I have a theory that Jerry hates capitalism so he buys high end expensive products that everyone wants and destroys them in anger, then he does a lovely voice over
“Feels like it’s been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas” had me rolling 😂😂😂
This was maybe the most hurt viewers a video had.
the production cost is about $1590 where the fuck does the other 2000 come from i understand a mark up for profit but my god 2k
At the end he really looks like a malfunction robocop
I know it's not generous, but you could have done something like repair guru did😅
“Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas”  What a line that is 😂😂
Laminated Glass 🤣🤣🤣🤣
13:23 is the part can’t stop laughing 😂😂😂,
He is a threat for many tech brands💀
Finally, the only Vision Pro video worth watching.
This is easily the most painful video Zack has ever released
Hey Jerry, apple here, how you like the Vision Pro? Can you return it fully charged in the original packaging asap.. thank you
More and more expensive stuff here. Waiting Jerry make a durability test of the Bugatti Veyron soon or diamonds, not less
This one hurts more than usual for some reason 😅
This is the most painful video I've ever seen😢😢😢
I wonder how much it cost apple in research and development to get them to their release stage ?
I still cringe at him destroying tech so expensive i will never own it
I want a video getting everything back together.
This was extremely painful to watch
Why is there a screen on the outside just to show your eyes? It's dumb and stupid and it also raises the price significantly!
Strap is flammable then
13:25 🤣🤣🤣
This is one of the better headsets hygiene-wise but they're still using fabric integrated into the body which can't be washed or replaced, WHY???
Scheduled text messages are a game changer
5:49 : To keep tears of loneliness away :( ....
As a PC and android user I found this deeply satisfying.
Zacks thumb takes deeper cuts at level 3
This was a hard watch that's £5,000 😳🇬🇧
Thank you for commenting on the accessibility aspect of it. That alone was enough reason for me to subscribe, and your content is great.
As a Certified Apple repair technician, this was ungodly painful to watch 4k just......DESTROYED! But also as an Apple certified repair technician, this was sickeningly cathartic to watch!!!
Ending finger tap😂🔥
You didn't say anything about the Crown knob at the top of the VisionPro
Bro what are you doing, don’t destroy give it to me I need it 😢
Yep it is the biggest flop in history of tech meta quest 3 is 500 and better in almost all ways
as an apple employee it hurts me to watch this
Apple created a piece of tech this time but the battery and price is...
It's crazy how cheap some of the parts are and really sad it's designed to be thrown away instead of some low level service. 😮
haahhahahahahahahahahahahhaha
it's not worth 3500$ at this build quality 🤣🤣 better stick with an occulus quest 3 or Pico4 for 400$ and doing pretty much the same thing with bigger FOV
😉 Wink might be a good way to click...
Jerry is doing insane work. Tearing apart the Vision Pro.
Someone must be turning impatiently in his grave... Jobs
🍎 is 🗑
Your narration is equally as good as the video itself. Love the subtle humor and sarcasm used at all the appropriate times 😎
When you removed the lenses and I saw that there is nothing behind it, I got a really strange sensation. Like when you put that thing on you can see the whole world and more but it's actually not transparent like a glass, it's all fake but also real at the same time. Ofc no one is surprised by it, since we know how these works but I just had a sudden sense of reality.
God I was waiting for this.
Did you exoect it to be fully glass?
Apple doing the worst products since the 90'
I just got a few decades younger watching this. Excellent work 47.
it hurts
It’s important for the world not to shit on gen 1 to much as not to hinder getting gen 5 of this tech
For the first time, I wanted to tell Jerry not to tear a product down 😭
So they use that much plastic and its still heavy af... i swear this thing is only impressive software wise..
I actually thought the Apple Vision Pro was going to be a dud. The interactivity and immersive experience it offers is a game changer. However, the fragile laminated glass on the top is a concern they need to address.
No snap
That non auto extinguible fabric... not sure if fulfills with EU regulations....
Quest 3 with extra steps and additional 0 in price - with terrible build quality
probably the only apple product i ever want in my home
Will we get an Apple VisionPro teardown skin?😊
can person with one eye can use apple vision pro?
Hello, I love the vids and the style :) Makes me laugh cry and cringe. If you would like to send me your damaged Apple Vision Pro - I'll send it back - I just want to 3D scan it and measure it to hell - so that i can 3D print accessories for it and sell them. Thanks - I willl pay for postage. Gerry Rig was one of my dad's phrases - he could make a radio transmitter out of a washing machine. Bless his soul.
It really is a phenomenal feat of engineering. This is Gen 1 - can we imagine what in the world Gen 2, 3, 4, etc will be?!
this is painful to watch
I guess whenever Jerry enter a tech store the staff be like: Oh here he come, he gonna rip some stuff again. 😂
12:23 I don't know why but i laughed so hard, u see everything destroyed on the desk and then Jerry suddenly promotes Anker products with the apple vision destroyed on the background lol
the front bit made of fake glass/plastic makes sense bercause making glass that shape + risk of it falling an shattering isnt good, i agree with less scratch proof yes but nice portable case with it and no risk of shattering or not ?
I know its for science but i cant watch it. Painfull. I cant afford and wont be able to afford it 😒
Thank God the strap is from recycled materials and carbon neutral. I'm sure enslaved kids in Chinese factories assembling this really appreciate it.
We did notice the thumb slice !! 8:41
For the price, I am surprised that they did not use a coated Gorilla glass. Coated to encase the glass if cracked. Soon, this will become contacts available to the public.
3500$ for this 😂
I commented yesterday for it and today here it is😊
Cheap plastic.
The plastic lens is an awful idea. At least Quest and Pico have support for prescription lens modules made from glass so that they can be cleaned without the risk of stretching. Whoever has used VR glasses for some time knows how often and easily they fog.
Я всё еще надеюсь что они работают
My heart dies a bit... 3,5k$ and you slicing it like an apple
Jerry just made a piece of art 😂
I’m sorry to be the one to say this, but…  *it’s
It's been a while since I physically cringed during a JRE video
Can you open the battery pack. I want to see how much empty space is in it.
Imagine selling a product and seeing Zach's name on the delivery address 🙃
omg, love you sence of humor very much: "the rubber`s probably there to help keep moisture makeup, sweat and tears of loneliness from entering into the motorized internals"))))
"Oh wait, I didn't hit record"
Sadly Apple probably has the love of a thousand grandma's knitting those in a sweatshop somewhere!
its apple, nothing here is suprising
The first video I ever watched of yours was when you installed a lift on your Tacoma. Could you possibly make a voodoo blue Jerry rig everything knife to match my Tacoma that that me interested in your videos?
The best part of this video was your ability to fit the word "girth" in there.
Lol this is not even in my monthly salary 😅
During your destruction, did you find any actual memory on the board?
Watching Jerry destroying  things that I can't afford on a weekly salary all for the sake of science is a guilty pleasure.
I have been waiting for your video after watching other apple vision pro destroy videos...later I thought you would never post it but now I am totally sure that you can break almost anything on this planet 😅😅😅😅😅
I wonder what people dropping $3500 on this garbage think of the thing a week or two later. Most likely that it's way harder to just read emails or whatever than simply scrolling a phone or tablet.
Cool voice lovely vid
The back wasn't knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas, it was most likely a thing child from a sweat shop getting paid 10¢ a day 😅
This hurts my entire body😔
Carnage 💯🙌🏽
This thing is pretty useless just get a quest 3
2:50 it is spelled : lame glass 😂
2:23 I was expecting "at a level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7"
I start the video and it begins at 2:07 and I was like heck yes no skipping!!
Meanwhile tim cook is getting heart attack after watching this 😂
It's a very interesting piece of tech and thanks for... destroying it 🤣 But I have to say I expected something more "thin", "more modern" and "less bulky" from apple. Just like normal glasses to be able to use it without looking weird in public. Maybe they come up with some pure AR tech aswell.
Well. There goes a 2014 honda civic 😢😅
Apple engineers are crying watching this.
Why they placed glass in the inside in the first place
you have no idea how satisfied i am watching you tear this piece of crap :)
Holycraft ,im literally in pain rn watching ur second video 😢
The biggest rip off technology in history
Scratches on the exterior would most definitely degrade your viewing experience, if its over a camera. Would ruin the VR passthrough and tracking of your hands
I’m no apple fanboy, however the practice of destroying high-end items like an Apple Vision Pro for visibility highlights a glaring issue in Western society: a blatant disregard for resources and the privilege of abundance. Beyond mere wastefulness, it reflects a deeper ignorance of where these materials originate – often from third-world countries where labor conditions and human values starkly contrast with the West. Both the creator and the audience share responsibility in perpetuating this cycle. By engaging with such content, we endorse a mindset that trivializes the efforts and resources from less privileged regions, normalizing the destruction of valuable resources for entertainment. It's crucial for us to reconsider the content we consume and demand, advocating for sustainability, ethical sourcing, and a respect for global labor and resources. But i guess that people these days take everything for granted.
Tears of loneliness 🤣
it is satisfying to see him destroy stuff that I can't afford. Keep going mate that's what I was doing to water bottle of other kids in kinder ;)
Tbh, I can't comprehend how zach destroys a gadget worth enough to buy a used gmc truck 😭😭😭
For the price ... it doesn't seem to be very good quality
THANKS MR JERRY
Its crazy how apple could of made this easily repairable, its ridiculous!
bunker update
I was waiting for this teardown 😂😂
Jerry rig on rig on !
"Feels like it is knitted with the love of a thousand grandma's". Close! Like, a thousand Chinese Children close 😂
Is still working?
8:09 iPhone have scheduled text messages
only person that rips some of the amazing tech in the world
Zach is have too much money now, he dont hesitate to destroy this thing, unlike some other youtuber open it slowly and carefully from the laminated glass side😂
Be gentle guys don’t take a razor blade to your $3500 head set
Wow, Wow,  Thank you so much Mr Rig,  I've been waiting for your review.   Thanks.
Yea, I stopped being bamboozed by Apple last with the iphone 3s.  Go figure!!!
Due to its bulk .... In 2050 people would look at this and think to themselves "how technologically inferior we were back in 2024"?
I'd never buy this ewaste but I must say those internals are quite sexy
Honestly, I'm not an Apple fan, but man.. Doing all that would hurt less on my skin!
Nice and good suggestions for   improving accessibility. Personally I think a small and a large would do well but appreciate this is version 1
The vision pro is interesting. More Interested as to how the bunker is coming along! 😅😅😅
Hey, ypu left the battery teardown.
6:55 not designed to be repaired. Well, thats a given at this point.
its been knitted with the love of a 1000 chinese children :(
Mujhe hurt ho rha hai Bigg boss !😢
Very sturdy for any 5 year kiddo.....
How many views do you need to get 4000 USD back? 😀
6:15 This could be dangerous, I hope no one tries to do the same thing to prove it’s breakable.
This was a messy and enjoyable Durability Test + Teardown 🍎
Love of a 1000 grandmas😂😂😂😂😂😂
bro this guy is biased stop receiving wrong info from these types of reviewers like MKBHD
😂 the amount of people apple has to pay to use these ugly things is hilarious
SHEEEESHH
This makes me far away from the Apple ecosystem. It feels premium but is still made in China and has a ridiculous price.
Bottom line Extremely Fragile
i know i shouldnt be surprised by the lengths apple fanboys will go to to justify what they do but im shocked a $3500 piece of tech having a plastic coating on the OUTSIDE while being labelled as a glass cover isn't a bigger controversy
5:44 "Tears of lonliness"! 🤣😂😅😓😥😭😭😭
8:05 "Scheduled Text Messages" was personal! 🤣
you can remove the bands with a sim eject tool from the side. just like the battery.
The price is bad enough, then I realized I live in Canada and in Canadian currency it costs around $4800☠️
This is going to be painful
Jerry just casually testing if cloth material is in fact flammable...
Dream one
Don't think this thing is meant for any repair.
Sell me this vision by dollar
THANK YOU FOR TEACHING Us about the Schedule To Text on Android !! It's seriously seriously an game changer 😂🤷‍♂️🤦.   I apretate it 🎉
Heart attack in my kidney
Some of this tech looks like something you'd see from future dystopian ungerground low budget augmentation
The only man pay 3400$ to destropy an Apple Vision Pro 😂
Do more VR headsets!
Disassamble the battery pack now!
Please make a mini museum for all things you have dismantled
Someone should snowboard with these and make a video
Why do I find this so satisfying?
FINALLY!!!!
How will this device work for someone with a big nose?
Some body looked at ski goggles and a Mac… and stuck them in a press
"tears of loneliness." 😭😂😂😂😅
Amazing 🎉!
You know what grinds my gears? iFixit has a disassembly video you didn’t follow and you’ve ruined it 😂 wouldn’t it be more satisfying to rebuild it and use it after all?
Redmagic  9 pro  tear down please
Are you still getting paid by Samsung
The front scratching so easily. Yet cost a stupid amount. It’s a razor blade yes, but it shows a wrong move against any hard surface will scuff it bad.
Destroying 3.5 G in one go when half of the people cannot even affort it...
After having destroyed the glasses he sends them back to apple: I really hardly touched them and look what happened! 😂
It’s absolutely ridiculously that there are people starving to death and we have influencers who have so much money to burn that they burn a gadget built with the Earth’s limited minerals and the labour efforts of people just to destroy. Scratching just to test the hardness may have some educational purposes, but burning the strap and cracking open the hardware such that it cannot be assembled back for repair just for entertainment is horrendous.
He Must Be Rich ..lol  ..I want one but I can’t spend $3500 😂
Apple has the worst keyboard to interact with ever!
In an odd way, this starts to justify the price.
Noo lo compre 😮
What an absolutely pointless bit of tech that is. No way is anyone going to use that for anything other than a gimmick. Expensive and pointless.
You would think a company like Apple would have their quality control do this and make improvements before launching, but it's obvious Apple is only concerned about marking up a cheap product.
He meticulously discest art with intent.
Your hair is flammeble too 😂
ME BITING MY NAILS
which level tool Jerry scratches his head with?
waste of money......apple is making sh!t
Holy S**t
Bye bye $3500 🤣🤣 I enjoyed this..
I remember watching him rip the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra......God i was hurt😢
Wow I
Ahahaha what an absolute scam of a device! Their design seems to be "great to hold and look at in a shop, ruined immediately when you take it off and put it on your table at home."
I'm always amazed how neat and tidy are your dissassemblies. You would be a great surgeon in the middle ages ;)
At this point we can rename the channel to JerryScratchEverything
The plastic front cover is very disappointing, it's definitely going to get scratched up and it's gonna need to be replaced very often
can we charge the anker powerbank with another anker powerbank while charging the apple powerbank? we can make an infinitely power supply this way
Man buys a 3500$ product and destroys it ‘ WTH is Apple’
Hello Jerry Could you send me a laptop 🎉
That proprietary “lighting” connector is abysmal.
Plastic rubbish
4 lakh gya tall la na😂😂😂😐
Id like to see this put back together 😂
Seeing someone callously destroy a 3500 shmuckers gadget is eerie...
I am not Apple fan buy please stop this work
I've always wondered what that level 9 would be like
The chills ran deeep on this one, had to watch a couple of the metal scratches twice
Quite well engineer. £3500 worth? Nah I'm good.
Wasted should sponsor me one I m broke😢 my country still haven’t come out yet
Did this hurt the Apple Vision Pro?
DANG JERRY! You butchered the thing! 😂
Thats what we all waited for
Your mic name ?????
11:40 Absolutely  What happens to the parts?
The more he tears it apart the more I respect Apple for building this monumental product
Destroying stuff is fun….but why when you pay for it
***  *Here for the carnage* ...  ☠🔨⛏⚙🔪
They should have put the processor outside with the battery to make it lighter.
this whole video just gave me eternal pain
That's cool and all but why did you tried to open your finger as well?
Most satisfying video of this universe
I could take the Samsung 24 Ultra, but this is toooo much 😂
Man this channel beats therapy 😂😂😂
"The tears of loneliness" 😪 You got the target group right on there....😂
RIP Apple Vision Pro 😢
TWiT had a great podcast segment talking about this and how as a product it only makes sense for YouTubers using it for the hyped content. Anyone who bought this and expected it to be a useful, valuable, cost-worthy product is a rube.
We see scratches at 3 with deeper grooves at 4 Well, we have leveled down a lot from the IPhone and samsung
Im in missing a joke here? You and MKBHD both said USB-C woudnt work on a moving person is nonesense sind my Quest has a USB-C port and the cable never fell out. Is this an inside joke or am i missing something?
Ay papi no
Wow wow. This is disgusting destroying such an art. I have seen other opening it with respect.
For $3500 would it be so fucking hard to use glass lenses instead of plastic?
I am an Apple hater but I thought the Vision Pro would've actually been something interesting but I see it as an iPad strapped to your face with plastic in the front which is a huge concern for longevity.
Sorry, don’t see the use of destroying a 3500 dollar piece of hardware. You could use that money for something else !😢
You destroyer! One day you’ll pay for everything you did to them! You merciless demon! 😤
1:23 "The back strap feels like it's knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas" -  Bahahahaha
00:04 Apple Vision Pro's surprising build quality and comfort 01:41 Apple Vision Pro has scratchable plastic surface, costly to replace 03:22 Apple Vision Pro has a plastic outer layer, making it more vulnerable to scratches and impacts. 05:06 Use soft cloths to clean the lenses and be cautious with the housing material 06:42 Apple Vision Pro is not designed for repair 08:22 Removing the Apple Vision Pro's cover glass. 10:17 The Apple Vision Pro is a groundbreaking device with advanced hardware and innovative features. 11:54 The Apple Vision Pro's battery pack capacity may seem small, but it has a high watt-hour that provides about 2 hours of runtime. Crafted by Merlin AI.
We want the battery teardown video
Where is Dbrand transparent inside skin for Apple Vision?
pretty awesome
Insane video 😮❤
Honestly apple basicly lied about it to the point it's unsafe and can keep burning on it's own... i think some consumer groupsvwould like a work with apple with possibly a judge giving his views on the matter!..
Apple : We have priced it at 3500$. He won't dare... 😈 Jerry : 🔪🔥💣
lol them scheduled text messages is a deal breaker 😂😂
“Die hard Android user” what in the actual fk?
i dont find any gentle in this video , you literally  made surgery to the whole thing
i'm not paying $3,500 for a piece of plastic
Isnt glass heavier?
That's pretty unacceptable that the outside layer glass is not glass but a scratchable plastic.  Apple should have been including an outermost screen protector layer since that's the case.
RIP APPLE VISION PRO
I’ve been waiting on this video !
200 میلیون عینکه 😂😂
Gotta admit, it looks crazy clean on the inside
They keeping glass for S model. Just wait 1 year.
This dude has seriously weird inflections in his speech
How does  it feel destroying a 3500$ stuff after you pay for it?!
Nice job thanks for the video
это было самое крутое видео в этом году))
kinda ridiculus that apple doesnt use gorilla glas on the outside of a 3,500$ device.
1:10 it feels like it has the love of 1000 grandmas because it foes. The love persists within the recycled yarn, and gets mixed together when they combine it into new yarn
Can't beat a sacrificial review. Appreciate the no BS and to the point as always 👍
Missed opportunity for using the included polishing cloth to clean off that nasty thermal paste 😂
Every single scratch literally scratch my heart. After watching you completely tear down this thing I’m dead
this is awesome I love this video much❤
3.5k for plastic 😂
Jeez you really gutted the thing 😅😮
The first ever destroyed Vision pro on the world 🌎
We can't even get it in the U.K. and I have to watch it being destroyed. Not that I will ever afford it.
I’m horrified about the scratchability of the front. I’m never likely to be able to afford one, or need one, but for that price, I’d expect the front to be pretty much bulletproof, let alone that far down the moes scale. I’m a die hard iPad/iPhone user (iOS works with my pill addled brain best lol) Great video and have subscribed. Xxx
Are you hired by Bill Gates?
Angry pro max
Definitely will flop
If you accidentally broke your front glass in vision pro remember you have to pay almost 799 just it to replaced or yet you can buy quest 3 for 599$  . It's crazy they are charging 799$ just for replacing a screen where almost 80% of tech is packed in quest 3 for just 599$
Jerry casually collecting apple fans' souls💀
U should look how Phone Repair Guru dissasembled it and reassembled it and is still works, it's well repairable piece of tech
You can schedule texts with shortcuts…
The most expensive teardown I've seen. I guess it is for science...destructive science😅
now bring it to apple care and see if they can fix it
The scratching is overkill bro.
Brutal 😂
Waiting for the ebay listing, lightly used.
Omg this is the stuff of nightmares
is there any way you cloud give away things you destroy and let people rebuild them?
Bro looks like a robocop with the glasses on :D
‏‪11:31‬‏ 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The best review trio - MK, Casey and Zack
12:08  why not available 68 w charging in iPhone😮😢
I love how love of grandmas is starting to become a quantifiable resource😭🤣… made with love of a 1000 grandmas… lmfao🤣
Apple does sht like this all the time and people act surprised EVERY time... Yeah no shit apple would fck their customers over... again.. no way Edit: I need that oled display on my desk, the oled module itself looks really nice. It's a refreshing sight to see, that apple does something somewhat innovative!
He may have void the warranty,ya never know though
Great that you pointed out Watt Hour  and what it means. Other reviewers like MKBHD are too "dumb" to understand the differences.
too bad the protective textile piece is sawn with the tears of thousands of underpaid children instead.
The number one reason why those Tech YouTubers opinions are trash! If that was a Samsung product. They would talk about how it is a fingerprint magnet and how easily scratched up it gets.
its plastic, real classic
10:03 A little ASMR from Jerry 😆
Reminds me of the terminator movie or robocop
1500 $ manufacturing c 11:28 ost sell price 😮😳
Has he done a video for the Meta Quest? or other VR headset
That had to be one of your most satisfying teardowns to date Zack, and I love the reference to the Oasis.  Just finished watching that show, and yep here we go!
this man is so gentle lmao
is your finger okay?
I used to hate jerryrig videos at first, but he is now one of my best tech reviewers. ❤
vire naice 👏👏👏👏👏👏
A previously failed idea, but several companies still insist on this type of product, but I think that as long as they are that big the public will definitely not receive them, When it is compact enough like conventional glasses, then we can have a new chapter
That amount of thermal paste disgusts me
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂.
Next time can you give a sound warning my ears
this is the most painful video i've seen on this channel by far and I'm all down for it
ima go out on a limb and say this thing doesnt work no more
I am genuinely surprised that they went plastic for the internal and external “glass”
Tears of loneliness 😭
savage
I am actually crying while watching this … new kind of horror …
More tat we don't need.  How ahead of its time the film WALL-E was! All we need now is Elon to sort out huge hotels in space!
im happy its an apple product
nah that's really cheap off Apple
Watching new iphones getting destroyed was hard enough for me, but this is on a whole new level
Whenever he used a scratched the Apple vision pro, I just thought of all the money he just lost.
Tears of loneliness 🤣🤣
Jerry Got Too Much Monies 😢
“We start seeing scratches at three, with deeper grooves at level four” 🥲🥲🥲 saddest statement of all time
Replace the vision pro with person for the first 1 minutes. Serial Killer vibe
No doubt at all why these costs around 4000 $ , the engineering behind this thing is insanely fascinating. 😲
Apple is scamming isheeps for $3499
So excited to see this video xD
apple kept producing e-waste
PLEASE SEND THIS TO APPLE CARE BACK, I WANNA SEE THEM REACTION HAHA
Cheeky as for that much......hate apple
It is so nice to see how u destroy a $3500 piece of hardware while I struggle to pay my bills with a $500 salary.
Vivo x100 pro durability test video plzzz......
Love this guy, took $3500 and jack it up! for science
We just witnessed a crime against humanity
I actually cannot believe that a guy scratching things to see if they can get scratched has 8 mln subscribers. To your knowledge - you dont need to do that. Thanks to science we have a table of material hardness (or whatever is it called) and we already know that without actual need to scratch :)
Tears of loneliness.....
9:32 I bet the 3rd party repair community will help out a little bit, maybe, market share might not be high enough to justify. Ofc, if someone can just drop $3500 on that, they have $800 to fix it.
"The word glass is doing a lot of heavy lifting here" lol.
how can they justify that price?!?
TechRax taking notes...
This teardown is so painful 😢
Yikes. But I guess cheap fragile hardware is a way to prepare pigeons to buy the next generation... I wouldn't even pay 350$ for that 🗑️ 🔥
Holy moly😢
Non repairable tech is just horrible. Do not buy anything you can't repair, without breaking it more. This feels unnecessarily complex, so that you are forced to take it to apple, for anything more than a front screen replacement. That is if you can even get your hands on the front screen replacement.
Cool, but i had to check another video from someone else to know what is this all about. LOL
Do you know what I found amazing about this video other than one hell of an expensive tear down? Anker ? Damn they knew Jerry would definitely make this video and this one would definitely definitely pop so they sponsored this video. I mean their marketing team definitely picked the right time, man and as a Anker user who loves their products man this is such a cool brand . Cool
you look so god in it
I have enjoyed Every durability test of Samsung or iPhone but this Vision Pro made me feel sad 😢
Can’t wait till they release the rest of the scuba gear 🔥
Ngl apple have outdone themselves.. crazy tech inside
Just watching he is leaving scratches in my phone screen. 😮
“Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas” 😂😂😂 that made me laugh so hard
I hate Apple but even I can't watch this video. Leaving a like for good luck!
OMG.. Why o why.. Product that I could not buy just been destroyed..
why breaking things man ???
That hurt my heart Jerry….. you cut me as deep as all apple products around you! 😂😂
I have to remove it near campfires! Don't tell me I'd have to see others. Virtual camp- problem solved.
I’m sure Apple has 1000 grandmas knitting these things in China earning a cup of rice per day
shit that noise of the knife on the aluminum just killed me
Great job Apple with all the tech inside, thanks Jerry for level 10 videos
I don’t understand how stuff like this isn’t a super huge red flag to society.. we’re doomed and I’m only 27 years old so I’m not some crazy boomer I just see much evil in this. Please don’t get this stuff it will ruin your perception on reality
That’s why you are not invited by the apple about apple events😂
My God this has been very painful to watch
I feel like he needs a counter that counts up how much $s worth of damage he does per video or even a cumulative one that rolls on per video
Thanks to Apple for not putting titanium on it.
PLASTIC ?? FOR 3500$ ? Damnnn, And I remember haters trashing the Fold because it had a plastic screen. At least the fold could fold, and it HAD to be plastic. Here ? They could have used glass, and called it "laminated GLASS", but no. What a let down.
I just watched a guy drain down 400,000 Indian bucks
Anker can keep you in the "oasis" for longer 😅 well played ready player one
Ngl I find it satisfying seeing him destroying stuff like that 😅
Therese a plastic schield on the glass
This is an incredible piece of tech
As a virtual reality research engineer this video is torture. 🤣😅😂
Wow, that's really cool. Thank you for such an expensive test
Anker help jerry to slap Apple 😮😅
dude how can u destry these items
כואב הלב 13000₪
I have been impatiently waiting for your clips. Simply put, you are the place.  The latest technology for I Called You the Morgue
Their cheaper products like the the iPhones are using Titanium , but this 3500$ uses aluminum unibody ? This is a scam
Don't forget about the souls of 1000 children dying from unsafe conditions in sweatshops balancing out the 1000 grandmas
if the scratches appear sensors...... really mess up your world view.... literally, figureatively and ECONOMICALLY LOL
give this man his views so he can afford to keep doing these videos
Tears of lonlyness, Brillant
Sir , that was savage.
Not me reopening the video because i forgot to like 💀
I love Ready Player One
I always watch your videos, I'm in love with the durability tests/teardowns. You mercilessly ripping apart expensive tech is a sight to behold. If one day I'll manage to buy an iPhone, the first thing I'll purchase next is debrand teardown phone case, I love those things bro. Much love from Kenya 🇰🇪
This hurt to watch and I don't even like apple lol
Have been waitin for this video
NGL this one hurt me man!
This isnt a teardown, it's a destruction.
This one was painful the watch
As an android user, I rewatched 10 times. Plastic for thousands of dollars. Jobs is laughing from his license plate free Mercedes in hell
how is this channel so sucessful? the dude doesn't have charisma and hes not providing any useful information
why everyone says ooo apple came with this😲😲🥰💅🏻, these vr have been here for a long time, apple just gives it a different name, an inflated price, makes it work more smoothly and everyone is so shocked like its their invation, no its not ( im apple user btw but at least i know im getting rip off :dd)
Very satisfying. Now please do the same to CyberTruck. It is supposed to be scratch and damage proof. 😂
4000$ into the trash, pretty sad they didnt use corning glass for the lenses.
“My patience is immeasurable”  As is all your viewers’. Straight up mindfulness video produced with chaotic fashion and precision.
liking your video so that you can recover your $3500 from YouTube
Usually I cringe from watching these destruction tests... even with iPhones. But this one was just fun to watch.
this video makes my techheart bleed. Greetings from Germany
Not gonna lie I cringed watching this.  Also remember why I don't use Apple anymore.  Go on son.
If someone's gonna pay $3500 for it at least they should expect a better build quality otherwise the price should have been way lower but that's Apple we are talking about lol
ngilu banget sumpah
One day Apple will either ban and sue you or hire you
Apple Engineer: How much thermal paste should I put in? Boss: Yes.
That's what I call tech gore
Hmm... how big should be pocket to put this thing with keys... 2:54 Guess user's hair will catch in fire first 4:09
nooo
So much Plastic, for that price a bit weird
Rocked my socks 😂😂😂
Apple terminator
great video! thanks!
now take it to apple for apple care lol
I got depressed watching this, can u test rolls royce next
Not sure I still love your channel after this 😩💔
cheap apple
I hate this video!, The Apple Vision Pro is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, and you destroy it! And burn it! I hate this video, I love how everything looks and sounds, and you scratch it up and heard it like that I’m probably gonna tell YouTube to not recommend this channel to me anymore
12:24 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😭☹️
Considering how much of a ripoff this device (and all Apple devices for that matter) is, I'm very much enjoying the process of you destroying it. It's disgusting that you had to search as hard as you did just to find some screws though. You'd never catch me dead buying an apple product after all I've seen them do to purposefully make their devices less repairable.
3500$, actually in my country my 1 year salary 😢
Jerry doesn't even flinch when destroying a 3.5k device 😂😂
aahhrg
Those scratches seem like something I'd DIY with toothpaste and thin sandpaper 😂
OMG I'm not even an Apple fanboy and this was painful to watch
No matter how expensive or how tough to get: Jerry will use his knife on it.
when I brought vision pro for repairs:
I’m really surprised to see this headset everywhere. I thought only a select few would buy something like this for 3,500$.
Jerry, you never stop to amaze me.. drool just flowed from my mouth while watching you destroy that vision pro.
Bro murdered the Apple vision pro 😊
Only Jerryrig is the only person I know to go such lengths!
As someone wearing glasses, scratching the lenses was hands down the most painful of all.
no words.
iJustine doesn‘t do reviews, she‘s simply creating biased fan ads. And I say this as an avid Apple user.
11:18 this needs to be kept at the upcoming WWDC 😂😂😂 at the entrance. What a masterpiece......
3200$ That's an insane amount of money for people who want to live in virtual reality.
What do you expect? Do that on the door of a Bugatti and you will be shocked by the damage it will cause. The price of the Bugatti exceeds a million dollars
Jerry lost 3,500 dollars today
That's pretty scummy of them to use plastic on both the external screen and the internal ones.
This is a very disturbing video.
The parallels to the first Iphone are amazing. It was also pretty "girthy" and had limitations in the Apps and bad battery life. In time these things will come down to the slim profile of a modern smartphone.  I wonder if it will eventually be one device. A slim piece of glas that will be insertable into a light weight  head band?
Every scratch worth hundreds of dollars 😅
Just think... If bro forget to turn on camara Recording 😂😂😂
Oh god, 00:01 1st second in I'm sooooo terrified of what I'm about to watch 🫠😆
Most awaited video
Waited for months, trying for minutes and destroy it for a sec 😢 its a world record
4:16 That noise made me throw my headphones off omg
Bro absolutely annihilated that Vision Pro 😂
4:17 i litterally shuddered.... plz stop.... you made your point..... WHY IS IT STILL GOING!!!!!
Can’t find hmdb s comment
Jerry. you gotta great voice
Thanks for risking your thumbs to make sure you scratch as hard as possible with that knife lol
Si messy....not a one professional expertise.... Waste of time,
11:48 they need to make the thing easy to fix instead of having to destroy the thing to get to a thing like a cooling fan.
This is level 10 🥺
Please protect this man at all cost!
Hey Jerry, I had to watch that twice to believe it. It costs around 4000 USD for the good version and uses plastic lenses that can't be easily replaced??? Pimax and Varjo been using glass for a while already.
Je sais pas si c’est satisfaisant ou horrible
"grand canyon level grooves" "scratches at level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8" 2024 is already off to a crazy start.
OK that's great, but what I really want to know is how does it stand up to a wood chipper? Not those wimpy little ones that practically choke on a handful of twigs, I mean the huge trailer ones that can gluck a whole tree trunk and ask for more. And you better buy a new vision pro to test, wouldn't want to give the wood chipper an unfair advantage testing a unit that's already ruined.
tim cook having an heart attack watching this
I am sure china is thanking you for all the secret hardware you are showing. Hahahahahah
This is a bit misleading. At the start of the video you say its "not glass, its plastic". Making it sound like its entirely plastic. But then you say it's laminated glass (2:44). So the problem here is the laminated bit on the outside, which makes is easily scratchable. I think the emphasis on it being "plastic" is too much and misleading.
Eish this was kinda heartbreaking 💔
That was painful to watch
the most useless tech product
Watching this literally hurts me
Jerry casually destroying a $3500 item while me here unable to afford a replacement screen for my phone
Somebody is going to ask can the vision take a shotgun to the face like the super expensive sunglasses ……I forgot the name. I am getting old.
This is the future ❤
Really makes you wonder how much cost/weight they could have saved by getting rid of the front screen. From reviews certainly seems like it's a pretty useless feature
cheap apple crap as usual
Well you can scheduled text messages in terms of receiving them
😂 knitted with the love of a thousand Grandmas...
That strap is legit the whole product this is the future better and bigger than iPhone I need this
Apple will be like : Ok ok ok.. you proved your point deeper groves at level 3.... stop vandalism of the vision pro.. we agree its not laminated glass either 😂😂
It's amazing how apple is always going to find a way to scam it's fanboys.
Gosh this was painful to watch. This thing is an engineering masterpiece.
Only a fool would pay $3500 for that.
yeah, Anker has been busy. At spying on people that is...
Apple vision pro: If you can afford one, you can afford replacements
thank you for this incredible work. ur 3500$ spend didn't go to waste (figuratively).
UnBreak My Heart when watching this vd:
Just like watching kids put iPhones in the valcano……..there was that guy who destroyed the first ps3 with a sledgehammer.
I've watched many of your videos, but this one hurt me the most.
9:01 ONE PIECE
It's cool to have companies like Apple. They do real research before implementation.
Hi Jerry, can you send the unit back to Apple and ask how much it would cost to repair it?
Here is this very expensive overpriced luxury accessory, watch me destroy it.
damn!
It was hard to watch
Premium Plastic?
now put it back again for a giveaway (to me)
$3500 and plastic instead of glass surfaces... Pathetic...
What's the point of making a complex 3D shaped glass.. and then covering it with a plastic? It sounds like something went wrong here.
It hurts! 🥺
Do you really know how much of pain many of us were in watching you literally shred the device to scrap?
Idk y but this was so satisfying 😅 apple products suck
Not worth 3500$ price tag for plastic
All made in china.
that´s beautiful how it gets ruined...
oh noooo
This gave me anxiety, but at the same time the soothing Bob Ross voice calmed me down 😂
Loved the Oasis shout out 😄
Tears of loneliness protective layer, nice Apple.
who would want this at 3.5k, gerry is spending some serious cash (although he gets it back with this one video)  costs $200 to build and $3300 profit for apple
This guy just destroyed a $3500 vision pro calmly
Apple Fanboys must be crying right now 😂
Why are you destroying every tech company devices? It doesn’t make any sense to destroy a piece of technology.
Annihilated
Ayo what was Jerry doing at the end😂
Oh man, 3500$ item that works... Ye no sht
This thing is the beginning of the living zombies, THEY LIVE
Theses videos help me appreciate the things I have
Virtual boy
For the price of 2 goggles you could buy a house in '55...
Hey, let's not do it again, okay? Do you realize how costly it could be? We've gone through so many expensive devices before, but let's not make the same mistake again. Think about it, let's not face the same disappointment and regret :(
i was waiting for the bend test
this makes my heart ache
This made my day thanks man😂
Yeah no way a usb c would work, like the Meta Quest 2 and 3 and probably every other device on the planet.  Classic Apple BS
They spent so much in R and D that there were not enough money to use descent materials, really sad from apple
yok artık yapmaaaa o kaç para biliyon mu daha önce sayısız premium cihaz parçaladın ama bu olmaz ;(
Indeed the first cause of my electronics failure is Tears of Loneliness 😢
I love how you analyzed the product so well. Outstanding review! It is good that you have pointed out how this product can't be used by those who have hand disabilities.
bro's proffesion is his best childhood hobby, destroying things!!
In Australia this product is $6000 and what do Americans do, they scratch it and smash it 😆😆
Please, do the same with Quest 3, who cares about Apple Vision? Quest 3 is the most popular and the best one.   Thank you!
3:15 Just Apple, you know?
I'm glad that there are people like you Jerry who care immensely about accessibility features
The first vision pro which was Destroyed first.
More like the suffering of a thousand Chinese kids
If you want to scratch the glass ( or plastic as you say )with screw driver or a cutter, and burn the band …then it is better for you to buy iron mask to cover your head
Bros trying to get Apple Bankrupt
I scratched vision pro my heart is beating v fast 😢
i dont know what is apple going to do after seeing this video
Meta Quest 3 better value
bro literally gave me a heart attack
😂
あなたのお母さんが大好き
I had to close my eyes when destroying a $3500 piece of tech...
Apple? Using plastic?  I don’t buy it. They have iPhone glass, right?
wrist twist - awesome idea!
There accessibility options. A lot of them. You can change the input to be just glancing at an object to click it. It’s not android after all
Yeah that glass is gonna be real cloudy with a few months use, unless you treat it like a baby of course.
This destruction cost more than my 2nd hand car 😂
Grand Canyon level of grove 😂❤
Interested how the Micro Oleds look like uncovered.
Tbh, I love this title. Actually not clickbait given that is exactly the reaction to have 🤣
a glass panel would probably not be a good idea on a portable headset
I'm sure apple never expected a durability test for this product. They thought it was only for their phones. Jerry needs to be sued 😂😂😂
Man no tear down of the battery what gives
Seems only people with glue running in their veins work at Apple
Guess people with taste are here for the deconstruction
This is joke 0 glass lenses 🤣
why does my heart hurt right?
Ai tag Hải Triều Schannel đi
Drop tests?
Great tech to use, horrible tech to own. Like Italien Motorcycles.
You spend so much money and you can scratch the screen merely by touching it with nails
Most painful video I have ever seen 😭
I can't believe they put plastic over the glass, that's going to be very upsetting for many vision pro owners!   I can't wait to see how this new product brings in a whole new world of virtual reality tech!
Vision Pro engineers really said: 💀💀💀
it hurts to watch, but it's impossible to stop 🙃
Tears of loneliness - COTD. Silicone Valley recently declared loneliness a health emergency. No doubt, this gizmo will drastically improve people's social skills.
you made me laugh Jerry watching you destroy this very expensive piece of engineering, it was very interesting and educational to see how the apple vision pro is actually built
So fragile and no right to repair repairability. That's a BIG no way for me!
I was so high that I started blowing at the smoke to let it out
Over 1.5 million views in 10 hours. This channel is lit
That's like ₹350000 getting torn away😢. But anyway, Jerry Rigs Everything
I love how you scratch and destroy this. Very satisfying. And a beautiful piece of tech inside. Thanks
It was painful to watch!
Just WOW . Thx for your content 😊
Ohhhhshiiit the blade across  the lenticular screen
Useless.
It boggles the mind that they included actual glass in the front panel, but put plastic on the OUTSIDE of it. Its somehow worse than if they's just used solid plastic.
4:18 - crick.... crickkkkkk. eww. that feeling. :X
Watching this was difficult 😂
Well Apple is selling overpriced easy to damage products. Who is suprised?
Hi Jerry I watch all ur videos pls donate me all motherboard that u have teardown last year
I was expecting the glass to be 5-15mm thick and be layered like polycarbonate/bulletproof glass. but I guess not, hey.
Just shows how much money these YouTubers make
Last few seconds 😂It was personal
Can you plugin a powerbank to the battery via USBC?
This one hurt a lot
You are the perfect tech antihero, even though with the decimated Vision Pro on your face you look far more villainous like Locutus of Borg!
I was soooo happy to watch you destroy this thing
Doesn't looks healthy for the health have that thing too close of your eyes and brain no thanks
I still don't understand why people buy apple products
wtf was the comment on the port? a usb couldnt handle a moving user? every single VR-headset user begs to differ.
Chinese brands will come with better product but half price and better quality materials give them 1-2 years.
love of a thousand grandmas lol
I wish I had it 😢
Wouldn't be surprised if it's plastic, I can't imagine how heavy it would be if it was glass
Meanwhile Tim Cook: oh not this dude again🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The last 5 seconds of the video...
I was just sitting yesterday wondering when JerryRigEverything is going to come out with his vision pro video while I was watching Marques Brownlee's video.
6:55 "Not designed to be repaired"
I don't understand these videos. A very beautiful device, why make fun of it so much? It was unpleasant for me to watch equipment being destroyed
Yapple vision pro
Ouch sounds throughout the entire video 😅
Meanwhile, here in Brazil, we're paying the price of a car + extremely high taxes to have ... this ?   No thanks, I'd rather have my 2019 mid-range Samsung
that sound at 10:03 sent me chills till my tailbone
Noooooo
It's unfortunate when intelligence leaves you.
You’re using your screw driver less and less these days 😂
First time on this channel my stress level 📈
3000€ for that kind of glass? Im starting to lose my trust in Apple
hi
pretty sure that the scratches were the screen protector, ive seen some videos of peopple peeling off the plastic screen protector, for another display underneath that doesnt affect the headset at all
We can get out of our bodies and visit universes but still people prefer to live in a synthetic prison. Sad.
Wanted to see the inside of "External Battery Pack"😢
no bro don't do that please please, amazing content
Well, that was unexpected
Bro is  "I am not in pain, i am pain"
Your reviews about Apple products are always in a descriptive manner, unlike other companies
I think the internal looks so incredible beautiful then any actual consumer product I have seen in a while
The dread of Apple employees before launching a new product bcause of Jerry
this was painful
Waiting for this video since I first saw the review video on MKBHD.
Ayya manasu kastama irruku ayya 😢
I waited days just so I could get my first look at the Apple Vision Pro from you, from the inside XD. 😂 Unbiased. Funny. Quirky. Exactly the kind of review I want to watch.
Its satisfying and painful at the same time
never thought a $3500 toy would be so low quality
😢😢😢😢
dude, this is gore hahah
Nahh the ending 😭😭
Finally, after about 7 years 9:10 he has finally answered the biggest question I've had
Why 🫠😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tears of Loneliness? Links joining an emo-core band?
I love how every new tech that comes bro just demolishes it lol
TECH YOUTUBERS SAID IT WAS METAL
🍎 It came like this. Still under 90 days.
Wait a minute, I thought mkhbd said it was metal?  So now we know he’s biased which is obvious
My biggest takeaway is, that you could build a vr headset with todays tech, that would be even smaller, if you get rid of the fans.
repairability is not an after thought, they thought well and hard abt making repairability as difiicult as possible
$3,500 and its Plastic! GFYS Apple!
I enjoy this one when it comes to apple products. 😂😂
Now you should make a video where you bring it to an Apple Store and ask them how much it  would cost to repair it.
Destroyed in seconds!
Not an Apple fan myself (iPhones are too simple for my liking) bit i have to admit the Apple vision pro is really cool
Every video of yours, I'm afraid you didn't get hurt. Be careful please.
Curious to how many people shouted `NOOOO` at the destruction of this :)
sorry not sorry but this is tutorial how to trow 4000$ in trasch
It’s not something new, Microsoft released the HoloLens 8 years ago
This tear down is more painful to watch for some unknown reason ... probably because it has the love of a thousand grandmas.
love you 🤣
With how expensive this is, if I bought one I’d get the most expensive screen protectors for every single glass.
Seems like @MKBHD is done with it 😂
This video was liquid pain 😔
Jon at fpt is crying right now…😂
10:48 What kind of thermal paste is that? Never seen any Black Thermal Paste before and i repair computers.
One of the most painful videos to watch ……🥶
Big minus: The cloth on the unit is not replaceable...
👍👍
Cmon accessibility needs improvement? lol ok
I can hear Apple Engineering cry while watching this.
insane.Scratching it hurts my eyes
It's interesting to see our dream product shattered into pieces 😂
jesus damn christ santa maria.....this was carnage!!!!  DO IT AGAIN !!!!
The fact that this is an Apple Device, helps quite a lot... and by that I mean, it's worth 3500$ and seeing it getting torn into pieces is making me quite happy if not straight out horny. It would've been soooooo much better if you had taken a sledge hammer for the disassembly!
Will u do a give away
rip 3 thousand dollars
Apple gonna fail hard with this one. Over priced and no proprietary apps. Just get a quest of you want VR.
So, there isn't a possibility for an Apple Vision Pro teardown skin, I guess? But there's a possibility of an X-ray skin?
Looks like shit. Outdated  technology. And why are they still using wires?!
awesome test❤❤❤
Been waiting for this ahead of all other vision pro reviews
.
This feels like watching someone take apart some advanced alien tech
Question: have you ever been sued by a company for destroying their product?
It is really obvious that you don’t like apple products. Makes me think what Apple did to you, or you did to Apple 🤔
9:47 just confirms that you are totally blind behind the goggles and rely only on cameras and sensors. So when some uninformed individual decided to take it for a bike ride (yes, someone will definitely do this) and while going downhill or approaching traffic, the thing decides to shut down because of its glorious 2-hour battery life and the rest is history.
Ugly as hell and overpriced, also poorly designed  But hey it's a start of something great.
Cotton underwear, folks.
1:52 Oculus quest, quest 2 and quest 3 has usb c, people are doing crazy things, while connected using a cable and it's fine.. So that statement that you just said is not true.
The dedication to his craft is outstanding! Who in their right minds would destroy by choice a $3500 toy!
it's painful to watch someone burning $3500!😭
$3,500 for plastic that's so apple
So apple care is a scam? Shockers, who could ever know
This is TOOO PAINFUL to watch!!!
Ain't no way you just wasted $3500 for one yt video 💀
And 3.5k ???
8:07 ✌️😃 who else fought that on the lens? Love your videos ❤
Apple just scammed everyone who bought this overpriced piece of crap ngl
Sorry but i just wanted to ask - who sponsors this kind of video? I mean, did apple sent you this to disassemble on your channel or do you buy it yourself for profits from selling knifes etc? I dont mean anything negative - just interested how this works.
Lol for as much criticism you give apple products, you end up using them for the ad with anker. Just use something you use daily and not pose as something you're not interested in. I'm sure anker has products that work with Samsung phones too.
Every scratch touched my heart. 3500 $, Carl!
I don't even have any Apple products, but why buy the product only to destroy it? This is one the worst reviews on YouTube and *the worst YouTube channel I've seen so far.*
Finally, the video I have been waiting for
The next challenge will be Crew Dragon?
Soo much for 3500$
What do you guys think of the people using the Vision Pro when they're driving and their Teslas. The other thing a lot of people were saying people are going to be wearing this out in public. Not paying attention to the real world because they're going to be addicted to this headset and then people are not going to want to interact with humans then there's the other side where people say after the wow factor is going to fade off people are going to stop using it in a lot of people say 3500 is too much
my wallet hurts just looking at this video
Is this a teardown or a tear up 😊
Why are we appreciating machining billet?  All this is applauding is for cost and vanity.  Why don't they cast or forge to 'near net shape' thus requiring less machining and lest waste?  When someone brags about machining something from billet they are just bragging about how much you are willing to pay for it.  Billet isn't god of materials, in this case its just marketing wank.
I mean you know how much they make you pay to get your watch waterproof again? lol  I presume the adhesion and pressure is done as per a standardized conformance, which can be done a lot cheaper if you don't care about that.  Also the R1 doesn't create a lag-free representation, you're just citing marketing talk lol.
Feels like it is been knitted wit the love of a thousand grandmas 😂 that is what $3500 get you... We cant deny apple knows what premium means
I was curious about the speakers though
great video
That was some tear down
Kinda inexcusable to sell something as expensive as this and build it in such a way that it's virtually impossible to repair. Why would anyone buy this? I appreciate the tech that went into building it, but it's 2024 and accepting to buy something that has to be thrown away rather than repaired is beyond insanity.
Hey Jerry, will you please stop putting pressure on a razor blade while cutting plastic towards your thumb. You could have life long complications if you on accident hit your thumb.<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
most brutal video on youtube  🤯🤯🤯
This YouTubers is insane 😂😂😂😂 Cool bro... Danngg...👍✨✨✨
Epic teardown!!
😂😂😂😂
Hahaha 🤪
They're not turbo fans, they're just fans.
I used to do teardowns on all my toys when I was a kid.  Pity there was no YouTube then.
Now, I know why it costs $3500 the design is amazing.
Love the way you describe the strap 😂 🤙🏼
Apple = Overprice
Cringe how you would express yourself as a die-hard android user or PC user. Just use whatever suits your needs,  don't let yourself be defined by it lol.
Man 😢
Those who understood the reference: "keep you in the Oasis for longer", are truly people of culture
Overprice as usual
what about the Meta Quest 3
Wait, so not only did they use glass, which is a really bad decision, because weight should be as low as possible for comfort and this is out the furthest, meaning you can feel that weight even more. They also laminated that glass with plastic oj the outside making it truly have no upside, because it still scratches as easily as plastic. What are they doing?
Oh yes this is one I was waiting on. Lets get in there Jerry 😆
Apple is a fvcking rip off with the plastic
I love these videos but then always cry in poverty 😂😂
seems fairly close to greatness, anti-repair practices aside.
This is the first channel to discover that the plug is removable from the battery, thanks jerry.
this is better than therapy
Bro! You forgot to remove the speaker/handles by pressing in the small holes just like the battery...great video thiugh🎉
😖😖😖😖😵😵 I can't see this video
Goddammit... I'm just hurt watching him destroy this
Watching him destroy stuffs i cant afford in 2 lifetime 😢
this hurts me internally but i do use android so i enjoy this.
This is the opposite of ASMR.
Apple care is like an subscription you can do it as often as you wanting 2-3 years for the price if 300. Still wtf
What happened to the "Lets get started" Intro?
It's not worth $3,000 more than quest 3 it's a joke and only the media care 😂😂😂😂
❤
$3500 for cheap dangerous hazards. What a joke.
Do you guys remember E.D.I.T.H ??
4:40 is the reason why i dont use headphones with Zach's videos anymore .
"I'll leave the software reviewing to people like ijustine"  Wait, what the actual fuck. As someone who's been on YouTube since 2006, you're telling me ijustine is still around and has transitioned to tech reviews!? How did I not know this? 😂
this is just carnage.
It’s going to be another product at your local thrift store soon
Me: Hey Man Zack: Hey what's up? Me: Good, what you up to? Zack: Me?, Oh no nothing, just about to tear down a new apple vision pro that cost me 3.5 million naira. Me (living in a third world country like Nigeria): (Imagine a Steven He facial Reaction)  😭
That front display and plastic is the most useless thing I ever saw on a VR headset... they really want to rip of people with those replacement parts for sure.
give me money, ok thanks :)
I wonder if/when people can hack these to make imaginary objects appear in front of you like tables and chairs to "force" you to dodge them even though they don't exist in the real world.
4k for plastic nice
so, ... after this review video you swap it thru Apple care? Or return as not satisfied?
The where's Waldo comment got me knew exactly what you mean but it's "where's wally" here lol
Tell me your a samsung user without telling me your a Samsung user.
Apple wont be sending you stuff after this ig
Definitely not worth the $3500.
I haven't even seen anyone actually using it (mainly because I've no interest on apple so the algorithm never shows any) and now the very first Vision Pro that I see is being destroyed. what a funny world this is.
Apple calls it spacial computing. While I agree that it's not really VR or AR, I would say it's simulated augmented reality, or SAR or just simulated reality SR.
Now you can try to put everything in its places)
oh god they're at it again
its hurts😩
I wanted to know if scratches on the front would hurt tracking
Well, at least we dont need a teardown of Darth Vaders helmet anymore
"Tears of Loneliness" LOL Love the reverse engineering!
omg just give it to 5 year old den do a voiceover
This video makes me very very useless human being.😢
😂Destroying this thing is harmful to his health
I own Vision Pro. Fantastic entertainment equipment. Immersive environments take us to new worlds! Cloth is provided, and store in soft case for protection. Buy one, the regret will not be yours!
How is anyone able to make it through these videos with the razor blade on metal scraping?
He took this apart like I did a junk toaster in grade school, and this costs more than my car ;-;
Последняя фраза была обидной😭😭
I felt physical pain watching this.. might even have gotten ptsd. 😢
We just lost lighting finally and here they go again with weird ass apple connectors
you are mad
I wouldn't buy this headset even if I had Elon musk money but this teardown still hurts.
Best unboxing😅
I believe that this video is the most insane tear down.  1. It made a huge mess all over the desk, 2. The way to get into the device is on another level with how unfriendly Apple is with right to repair. This product stinks of Anti Consumer repair.
I actually find it soothing watching him destroying stuff. Wierd.
I highly recommend to experience this sensual film played in reverse from end to beginning
Watched the whole video felt like it was 5 minutes but it was 13. I was like damn that’s a short video
wow, so much hate for an apple product. I'm not a big fan myself, but I see a certain aggression towards the product.
"Tears of loneliness got me" 😂
i dont get the why the scratches cant be done with the razor vertically and i have to take all that cringe
Apple less for more.... Nothing never change.... Trash quality for triple price. lens 35$ plastic cover 10$ apple match now 35$+10$ =45$+0$ apple = 450$ minimum... ez. Your Review apple product is best for me i know how this is build now and no need any turorial how to open this device ez to repair now thanks! Cheers from Poland.
Someone at Apple is crying harder than the lonely soul who's just scratched his $3500 ski mask after a day!
Yes, repairability sure needs to be improved, though I guess Apple has a bit more elegant way of opening the thing up. 😄 But I just can't help to gasp at this marvel of technology. It must have taken so much time and effort to design this thing. And there's no external processing. It's all in the headset. That's just amazing.
You ripped it like you dont care if you can ever put it back :(
10500mah, I have 25 tesla cells in my powerbank 😂 It can keep 2 phones fully charged almost a week 😎
You should have done a teardown of the battery pack too.
Can’t believe you spent 3500$ on this trash just to destroy it. You’re a better man than me.😂
Make a screen protector for the outer glass
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Well i will wait for some Chinese company to make better stronger VR headset for 300$
Heart-breaking moment at 2:48
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Bwahahaha, tears of loneliness got me big time! I needed a good laugh, thanks Zack. 🤣🤣
So i guess 1.3 million views gets somebody 3500$ at least then..
Wait im confused  im 2:54 in the vid and he says it’s plastic? But i saw a guy on tiktok shatter it
Jerry's tutorial on "How to flush $3500 straight down the toilet"😅
man this dude IS  CRAZY
This video hurts me
Some full ads to cover the cost :)
That calming voice while you see some psycho scratching and burning and torturing a machine is so freaky. I hear screaming, but I’m the one screaming.
imagine if Apple was like Ferrari with theyr products at this moment...
JerryRigEverything is horror channel for technology lovers
You are a genius but not good artist
Such a complicated piece of hardware. Respect for Apple.
Так держать 👌🔥 thanks 🙏 4 content 👍🫵🤝
How can i get the same wallpaper as Jerry’s iPhone ??? Anyone???
Stop at 2:40! I can’t see the entire video!   Nowadays you’ve to make quality tests with a broken display or something and not with a working piece!  Donate this money instead destroy it to get views and subs!
13:20 😅
Why did I enjoy this so much! We are a sadistic species  😢
One thing you must admit, Apple sure do some funky designs. Imagine starting out with a blank piece of paper and finishing with this. Repairable or not, I must admire the engineering that has gone into this product. But I won't be buying one! Another great video Zac. Thanks.
*and sillines
The theme of the channel this year is " no tech will survive my wrath"
The ending is priceless
This is way too painful for me 😢
Dear Vision Pro, stay away from this man. DANGER, DANGER
I always look forward to your tear downs 😂 none can compete lol
Vision pro looks the most badass on Jerry's head, nobody came close. Update after finishing the video: It even looks more futuristic in its skeleton form :D
the most expensive teardown!
Wow
You are destroying what can possibly change life right now. $3k.
My dumb ass blowing on my phone screen as Zach casually lets the strap burn
@JerryRigEverything I would like to see you do the same analysis ;) with a Microsoft HoloLens!  I don't know if you know BUT these glasses have Augmented Reality. A comparison would be awesome and you would be the first!
Why the hell is there a fucking lightning port on that battery?
If any other compant would have made this product than they would have made stronger and quality for sure.
He definitely is a fan. "Speaking of fans" and revealing turbo fans got me rolling 😂😂
I FEEL PAIN WATCHING THIS
Basically they are selling their brand name and attached PLASTIC to it.
12:00 THANK YOU. I have been absolutely loosing my mind about everyone talking about the low mAh on this battery, when mAh don't actually matter on their own.
Tears of loneliness. thanks for the reality check zach, even though vision was there to take that away
As an Apple hater this is SOOO satisfying... 🥴🥴
oh this was painful to watch! urghhhh!!
99,9% of Jerry's audience don't give a single crap about what's inside of this 3499 device. Seeing it being destroyed the usual way Jerry does was a real physical pain.
These makes me wonder the value of money 😂😂
Satisfaction level 1000 😌🙂‍↔️
12:12 the earpieces are also removable and reveals even bigger "lightning" connector
How much insulin could I buy for one of these😂
Im cringing all the way dude
8:07😂
Agent 47 now bringing his attacks to the Vision Pro.
11:31 THAT LOOK WAS THE BEST
Those grandma's really put in the working
Too expensive for most of us. 😂😂😂
APPLE having a Heart attack just by seeing only the thumbnail .
Is it another apple product to be on the shelf of shame.
plastic screen....nice apple,another lie
wonder how much more batterylife it has if ther fornend didntt have facial display
I worked with VR for years and I think it is literally *the most accessible* technology when done right. Weird how Apple talks such a big socio-political game but when they wait over a decade to do anything with VR they can't have some basic accessibility options pre-installed.
Revenge on Apple from a die-hard android fanboy hahaha.
You're Evil
Apple can produce and sell anything at any price it seems  If Samsung or Google made this all fanboys would criticize it ...
Well ... that hurts physically
It really grinds my gears, that out of all top tech YouTubers you're the only one, who mentioned Oasis. Kudos and great job!
4:18
Is there anything you reviewed that passed 10 level of scratch test?
I've watched a lot of phone teardowns but this is the first video that actually hurts to watch...
Amazing video as always, already 1.5 mln views, I hope it will at least pay for that vision pro :)
My god, the horror! I can’t look away 🫣   Love this guy! 🤣
“Hi, Watch me tear stuff up while doing a cool sounding voiceover…. aren’t I hip?” This guy really wants you to be impressed.  I am not hating on him, it’s just kinda weird.
tech ytbers after getting a new apple gadget...
How many likes do you need to count the pixels lol
A satisfying way to burn $4000 🤣
The internal lenses being plastic is a huge bummer.
Im genuinely impressed by the performance of that gadget. I believe its the best functioning piece of tech youll never need to do anything.
the apple is bad
satisfying breakdown. just how difficult it is to repair
You should take the remains to apple and ask them to fix it 😂
Fantastic. 😂😂😂😂
The number of people getting heart attacks when watching this😧
most satisfying video for me 🥳
Really expensive plastic
Why is thermal paste applied like this?😐
"apple needs to start selling an easily replaceable screen protector"  You probably don't know Apple, they don't make replacement any easier for their equipments.
Its terrible pile of junk. Those who use Apple Vision Pro while driving are traffic monsters.
10:03 DONT DO DAT
Anker should release a big battery which can be directly used with Vpro
Gosh been waiting on this one 😂
Scample
Cant wait to see how they make battery replacable for the EU market.
Ahhh I don’t want to buy it stop please
Its really gonna mess up your world view literally, figuratively and economically 😂😂😂
The fake eyes are just a cool gimick so it would be cool to remove them and bring back the see through mods
That head band was knitted with "love" by all the children working on their plant ay 😂
Dynamic plastic
You are bad news for every tech company 😆
I’ll take the headset in the condition it is
You could eject those speakers by using a sim ejector tool easily
After you get used to him destroying the phones every week, you might think you will cannot ever experience pain while watching his video.      Turns out, you can.
garbage
Cheap materials used all across the unit 😢 even internal lenses are made of plastic … that’s for 3500 💵 . Hell , That’s too much shame .
knowing that i will not buy the first gen, makes me happy watching the distruction...distroy away my good sir.
This might be the only piece of media I'm interested in about the robocop glasses.
Wait, *that's why I'm not supposed to use anything but microfiber cloth for my glasses?!* Why did no one tell me??? That would explain why my glasses are covered in scratches.
“Charge as fast as the original charger that didn’t come in the box” 😂😂😂
Wow 😅😮❤
8:09 scgudled text too
And once again you hurt your thumb just for us 😭😭😭😭😞😞
Apple Vision Pro with the Laminated Glass where the plastic is on the inside will cost you 4500 dollars
Does he buy them with his own money or are these products sponsored?
Seeing him just destroying things, is very satisfying.😂
android fanboys are just a different species tbh.. the wrong kind of
Wow 🤩 this guy is good and here I am taking care of my iPhone 6s Plus.
9:02 »Wild that this piece of "glass" alone costs more than some iPhones.« _~TheOneAndOnlyAbsoluteUnitOfAGigachadThatJerryRigEverythingKnivesEverything_  10:02 The Real Retro ASMR, guys!  12:12 JerryRigEverything: has an iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit Also JerryRigEverything: uses some random SIM tool
"lets commence the scratch test"
Can’t wait for the teardown skin 😂
Instructions unclear: My dog is now a chainsaw-wielding robot dog that won't stop spewing philosophy at me
No you didn't!!!
Almost $4k for something this guy and a toddler can destroy in short order. And even though this was a quick video, leave this in a room with little Bosco when you turn your back, and it’ll be faster than that.
If that is indeed plastic... then I think I'm glad that I didn't bother paying $3500 for a headset
why battery is so big and eavy compar to batterie of smartphone same amp.....
Me imagining i funna buy this at 3am while i go across the video this guy just breakin it
This video is particularly painful. Each test costs about $500 😅
It looks expensive on the inside.
At least it survives the bend test but nothing else 😅
Looking forward to the assembly video! 😄
The hardest video ever made
Only Zack wears a 50 dollar wristwatch but can durabilitty test over 3,000 dollars apple vision pro device for his fans. While destroying it tottally but not doing anything to save it .
Now we know who Tim Cook have nightmares about
Poetry with non-materialism life philosophy mixed in to the pure work of art ❤️
Great video! but if you make one fixing it like brand new... will be the best video on internet! :)
bro if you have 3500 dollar i dont have 1 dollar even . can you give me 3500 dollar , it will solve all my problems .
So I think this is an absolute disgrace, I mean these glasses cost $3500 and I think you can expect the front to be made of glass and not plastic
Knowing a $3500 gadget can be scratched that easily makes me glad that I dont have the budget to buy that thing
Oh man the ending is pure Gold Jerry, PURE GOLD!  (see what I did there) 😆
3500 $ for plastic, wow
The issue is there's really not a good use case for 95% of people out there. And buying something like this instead of a console or something isn't exactly a compelling idea if you want to enjoy yourself. It's a neat toy, but just doesn't have much application in most industries, especially due to apple's walled garden and difficult development path.
the same fate what lara croft did to the fight robot in 1st tomb raider, the assistant say it's a disaster.
The ASMR of these videos is horrible 🤣
ohhh it hurts
Disassemble the battery, please.
Shout out for shouting our for accessibility
That is the LUXE .... destroy a Vision Pro ....
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂
sorry apple but meta quest 3 way better 🌹
£5,000 and hes ruining it! :o
It's an interesting product but we all know, 20 years from now people are going to look soooo stupid for buying and using this. You should also be able to plug it in the mains.
Was waiting for this😊
This hurts me on many levels.
they have plenty of money, and still make shitty plastic products. Hardware is phenomenal tho
Jerry starts like he’s not really going to go on a rampage and then he just destroys everything.
Cyborg Zack
U can put a sim tool to open the speakers too
im looking forward to the reassembly video
I really thought we would get an "Art class with Jerry" on this one.
Never in my life I felt scared looking at a JerryRig video, now I am.
since users dont use the glass on the front.. straching is no big deal.. it is not like a phone screen.. it is just the front cover.. but the user uses the inside lenses.. so they are most likely well protected... never scratched.
I'm not an advocate for Apple. But as someone deeply involved in the VR world and sits on the board for Headset company is pushing the edge of what's possible. this thing is cool. for its 1 and only purpose. Enterprise work. It's horrible for anything else.
I feel sorry for mankind yeah the vision pro looks really cool and would be fun  but the day we are all walking around with VR in the real world we will/may lose touch with reality then the theory of us living in a simulation will become more clear baked in ads or promoting products in your face 247 its gota make us think are we really ready for it given that cloud gaming flopped back in 2009 amd now its used more and more mybe 2024 is a bit to Early lol but for real the vision pro head set looks really cool I've used PlayStation VR and felt really sick after life in VR
WIll it run Crysis ??
that's 😮 $3500 dude!!
Привет всем, кто говорит "эпл" а не "апл", вас 99%.
That's some sound work exposing marketing BS. Also "keep the tears of loneliness from..." hahahahahahahaha
Was wondering about the taped up thumb... 8:40 told me all I needed to know!
so painful to watch😶
who tf wears ar goggles near a fire source? who tf uses any piece of tech near a fire source anyway??
Welp I hope this video makes you back the 3500$ you spent on this
I was waiting for this for so long after watching MKBHD video
That thing shouldn't never exist
I wonder if it still works?
Yapple 😂
for 3500$ i could buy a brand new top of the line gaming pc, and still have money left over, not to mention a lot more use cases, good teardown though, kinda suprised to see the exterior screen and interior lenses be that bad on the hardness scale though
Imagine paying 3.5k to have a device made of plastic and recicled material hahahaha. Also your thoughts on accessibility are laughable.
My heart 😭
For such innovation of the internals, the outer display is shocking how easy it scratches & more so the cost to replace it. Surely it would be easier to make a detachable/customizable one if it's that easy to wreck it.
Hello, can you add Arabic subtitles to your videos please?
Apple lost their minds and hearts many years ago
apple is in schok after watching this and think to design harder as I pad haa haaaa🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was so painful to watch but so satisfying at the same time. Love these videos Jerry!!
it is glass tho, ifixit teardown shows it's like a permanent screen protector you find in something like galaxy fold  and of course no one in this world would use a heavy curved glass without laminating it, duh
My first reaction to the thumbnail was…..no frigging wayyyyy 😂😂
Expensive e-waste 😢
Don't! Stop! Don't stop! 😅🤪😵‍💫😱🥺😳😂
Tear of loneliness 😂😂😂😂
glass is heavy...
Started with some iPhone version they really are not giving a damn on customers, from a frequent buyer of apple products I completely resent the company now and will never buy one more thing!
i would love to see a video on your wheelchair tech/company, would that be coming anytime soon? or maybe links to that info?
REALLY CRAP MATERIALS USED AS ALWAYS. GOOD TO SEE THAT  LG SCREEN TECH IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD.
Glass is g̶l̶a̶s̶s̶ plastic. -z̶a̶c̶k̶ Apple
Some of the noises of the scratches... eugh, tough to listen to. But this work is very much needed and is useful, so thank you Zack.
What if (read full)  they make it like glass like normal glass but just like battery goes separately maybe also hardware could be  Like hardware in backpack(small as possible) 😌 and just light weight and super slim glass on your face, no limitations of space, more battery life. 😊
Jerry, you need to start dropping stuff please!
This is the  messiest dissection of the vision pro ever. What was the need to be so savage?. Don’t ever become a serial killer... Just saying!!
I don't care about the test, I'm just here to see the destruction of a piece of technology designed by an evil company to turn us into human vegetables.
Apple must say sorry to what ever they did to you😂
this makes me sad seeing somebody destroy something i can never own...
What a great JerryRigEverything video!
My reaction when I saw the thumbnail 😮😮😮😮 bro you gon open this up?
Looks like they are using the "glass" as on Mac's. Stupidly easy to dent it
I cant not believe Apple gave Jerry the AVP to test, he decimated the poor expensive  thing, how liberating.
As amusing as this tear down destruction is the Vision Pro a computer on your face. I don’t think it was designed with the robust fabrication of phones in mind.
that video caused the most physical pain so far for me :D
To all the tech youtubers out there you guys are just guys mr. Jerry hes a devil
bro what hapend
I don't plan to buy it but that scratch 💔
In USA you have all kind of stupid watnings, just so the company will avoid lawsuits...and at the same time Apple calls plastic screen "glass" and nothing is happening...how is this alowed and how is this legal???
8:05 you can actually set scheduled text messages on an iPhone
Makes me cringe how he also points the blade towards his hands eeeek! Always away from your body!
Нека да го ползват, нека естественият подбор започне сега!
I'm really sad they didn't come out the gate with a double blink option.
You should have donated this money to people who need it.. shame.
i hate the scratch tests
Stitched together with the love of 1000 Grandmas 😂😂❤😂😂 Bars!!
The apple engineers watching this 🤔🤫🫣😶😯😮😲😦😧😩😫😱😥😢😭🥸
"The love of a thousand grandmas" 😂
Just wondering, why do you refer to the fans as turbofans? To my knowledge a turbine does the opposite of a fan. And a turbofan is normally a kind of jet engine.
I am worried when the plastic gets scratched the lidar and cameras will be hugely affected! Think I'll stick with the quest 3
just waiting for the $7,995 titanium version with 2.5 gms of it around the edge.. and all to look like a really special gobshite walking down the road...🙄😂
But! Will it void my Apple care insurance?
Every scratch and burning it brought tears to my eyes....
3500 dollars... Pufff!
Лучше б мне отдал
I want to thank you from the bottom of my pocket to help me realise that I don’t need this product. 👍👍
Как же больно становится при просмотре видео от данного автора но в тоже время очень интересно 😂
Would this still qualify for 14 day return?
That's wrong! The Frontglass is NOT made of plastic, it is made from glass with a protection cover of plastic. It's a shield! Stupid Video for Clickbait.
Playing with fire is all fun ... but wouldn't it be more useful to test water resistance?
My clumsy ass would ruin this thing in an hour 💀
Every time i wanna buy an anker product through your link it says “currently unavailable “😢
12:25  the way he threw vision pro to introduce anker 🤣🤣🤣
There's something pleasing about watching apple stuff being ruined.
Tears of lonlyness thats deep
send me bro 😀
The speaker could be removed by sim ejector tool.
imagine paying 3500 dollar for plastic
i lost it when he scratched the inside of it.😱😱
so many tears of lonliness 😢 but I've got 🥽 so 😀
Hownto become rich like you to burn 3500 doller thing
Jerry has the best job ever.
You said Vision pro in not repairreble, then for what's Apple care is... Just 2 donate apple ah
Can you also throw in a battery taredown in the next vid? I'm really curious on what it's packing inside.
It is good to know this stuff ... Will help people decide if You want it... If You buy it You will know how to look after it. All good.
Apple vision pro to Jerry "Leave me alone 😭"
You can't make inside skin for this 😂😂😂
He freaking destroyed that thing...
Accessibility is not commercially important at all
people save & invest money to buy vision pro but this guy save money to destroy
next do the cybertruck
This was kinda painful to watch and yet so much fun! :D
Rest in pieces vision Pro
“… love of a thousand grandmas “ 😂
Look like Apple wants to pay even more fines to EU for not using USB C cable
And that is why Apple will never sponsor JRE :)
I was waiting for that reference to Ready Player 1!
that "fat lightning" cable lmfao, good to know it's real btw
My heart is broken while watching this🫠
It doesn't make any sense why they would use glass, it's laminated from the outside and the laminate isn't even swappable when it gets damaged. It just adds weight and a ton of cost, plus you have to be really careful to not brake it. Only reason I see here is so they can charge you 800$ for a replacement.
Bro violated at 6:05
Tell me your YouTube business is doing well without telling me it’s doing well.
This feels like he is taking apart darth vaders mask somehow
Gg😂 last frame is so fun😂😂😂
what's ITS?
A “groovy” production as always.
Hey Zac, could you add segments to your videos? And if not that, just mark the scratching segment? I care about how a device that I could potentially buy is made so that I can make the right decision, but I've got misophonia and the scratching of metal triggers me to no end. Segments would allow me to skip that part without having to waste time seeking around till I find the exact time you've stopped the scratch test.
Go on,buy this crap people be good 🐑🐑🐑
The internal design is exquisite
Jerry - There are an extensive array of accessibility settings for the AVP that do a lot of what you suggested. Like any first generation device, the AVP is far from perfect - but what it will do for the XR space is immeasurable. META has seen a massive bump in sales of its Quest 3 headset (and a chunky stock price jump) around this launch. The AVP will bring more consumers to XR, and when the Air version releases in a couple years at a much lower price point, that’ll expand even more - not to mention all the other manufacturers that will be getting more attention and moving more units for being a fraction of the cost of the AVP.
Your wordPlay is always on point.
I hope jerry has extended warranty checked😂
It will be used by Police 🚨 Military ++
How just how does apple get away with calling plastic glass and not getting sued into oblivion?
13:24 😂😂
The bright side is that you can use it for hours and it won't mess up your hair.
No usb c? Is there a different version for EU?
Fasho breaking the internet with this
People complaining about the price can now understand WHY it costs $3,500. Looking inside, it makes sense, and dollars
EU is gonna go crazy with all the special plugs on this unit.  Wont be shocked at all if they demand that Apple use USB-C.
legendary watch casio f91w build like a tank at the cost of a peanut
from s24 scratches at level 7 to apple vision scratches at level 2  2024 is different indeed
So what if you used a lighting to USBC adapter in the end of the battery then used a bigger battery to run the headset?
To much technology now days I do not like it. I feel like having a PC and a Smart phone is good enough.
No You Didn't 😂
Make a Debrand skin like the phone internals for the front of vision pro
I’m sure the Windows and Android Users enjoyed the vicarious vandalism as well…..
how much did the glass, the lenticular lens, and the front display screen weigh? I would like to see what is inside the apple vision pro battery. pack
So im sorry.... it doesnt have vision normally.... so like in apples usual way made something wrong. thats just vr not ar at that point.
Most awaited video😂❤
10:03 I DIED
Man how much do these videos pay 🤯
It's $3500 😢
You are just scratching and burning my heart bro😢😂
Well that’s was super fun Jerry, reminds me of myself as a kid in the 80’s. Looking forward to the next destruction.
There is a laminate / "screen protector"
Jang Abi we kang Jerry
Nobody but really rich people are gonna buy this when it costs as much as a used car
It just reminds me of 'Ready Player One'. Until all of this is distilled down into a pair of glasses.. waste of money.
These fans right behind, or in front of, the eyes somehow make me uneasy.
Tears of loneliness❌ Tears of joy✅
Apple company engineerings after watching this video 😵‍💫😵‍💫🫨🤒
I am so happy with your dbrand collab, I was going wait a second, he has my backgrou...oh wait, he made them..
We need an Apple Vision Pro Teardown Skin!
Frog
Apple must be one destroyed device away from sending Zack a cease and desist letter
Please rig the speakers and battery too...lol
not matter what glass will be always glass 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Apple mush cringe every time you get one of their products
Seriously 😢
I was looking forward for this iconic teardown🎉
This was oddly rather painful and rather entertaining at the same time.
我对你的视频进行了加工二次创作，如果您不希望我这样做，请告知，我会下架相关视频
😂😂😂apple
watching adult video in this would be fun
Im having nightmares because of you
imagine doing all that and realised recording are off.....😂
The proprietary cable is stupid. Quest2 and 3 and Meta Pro all use usbc. i own Quest 3 and usbc is just fine. Never had it unplug on me and i am playing vr shooters.
Bro has some personal issues with apple. since childhood never ate apple lol😂
You were viral on 4chan lol but not for this content
Do you recycle all those ripped electronic parts? Or do they end up in trash?
😂😂😂 people tho bought this a are suckers lmaoo
When Jerry's iphone came in at the end, a part of me is like "please don't mistakenly scratch test your own phone". lol
Most expensive tear/rip down yet 😂
Saw someone comment about jerry in mkbhd video saying cant wait to hear scrathes at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7
how much money do you have  jerry - yes
From a manufacturing perspective this thing is a complete work of art !
Brutal  😆😆
Watching all of this my heart rate to high
This was the hardest thing to watch for me ☠️
Doesn't matter what it's made of, you android fanboys would complain no matter what 😂
When bunker
this was most brutal rigging ever.
Look i am not an apple fan, but holy crap i feel sorry for that headset
I need this level of immeasurable patience. 9:36
Apple dictionary: Sapphire = Glass Glass = Plastic
I take Apple product appraisals from “Android users and Windows PC consumers”  on YouTube with “ the proverbial….grain of salt.”
Scratches on a level 1 and deeper groves on a level 2. Level 3 completely destroys it. Plastic is plastic and plastic cracks.
It would be really funny if Apple's products came with a "Hi Zack" message hidden inside
It’s like watching a naughty boy destroying his toys to get attention… I guess it is…
this one hurt
Of course it's plastic, it's already heavy enough
3500$ and using plastics that scratch easily instead of more durable materials that justifies the price ...
I was looking forward  for this iconic teardown ❤❤❤😊
Apple has some really cool tech, only problem i have is that they force you into that closed enviroment and that lot of things are overpriced af
Engineering well and people who designed were high technologists.
Apple vision 2 will be made from recycled cardboard, for only 4k $.
yes destroy this garbage  3500 dollar,     are they insane?   and there are people ho buy it !  😂😂
“Tears of loneliness” 😭😭😭
And to the surprise of no one this unit is unrepeatable
Imagine being this Apple Vision Pro in the factory with his others brothers : « Once we will outside, we will blow their mind with our capacities ! 😎 » then it arrives in Jerryrigeverything house 🤣
Impressive @Zach
Apple manages to sell shit 10 Times the price it's worth.
I am using glasses and they are made with the same material as vision pro glasses, or should i call plastic
Having plastic lenses is a wild decision, they're gonna make fat stacks with replacement parts for that I'll tell you that much
LIked
wish I could afford these😢
Who does that in the real life with a cutter ? This is not a real life crash test, just something to make a lot of views.. 3500$ lost ... 🤮 What's the goal ?
As always, despite not being a fan of Apple products, I cringe watching you scratch the front "glass" ... but can't stop myself from coming back from more. On behalf of a grateful humanity, I thank you for scratching all the products that most of us will not buy or be able to afford anyway.
I just love watching you destroying Apple branded 💩!
man, the fact that it recreates the world outside completely is so strange. with each update, they would try to make the recreation a bit better, a bit more 'fun', a bit more exciting, you know?
Your videos hurt me 😢😅
Why make quality, when you can earn more from crappy quantity - Apples motto, it seems
I was waiting. Him and o destroy this thing .....  I really hate this  thing don't know why.  I think it's. Challenging the reality... And I don't like that. ....
I’ve been watching JRE for years but this video was.. pain
Life tips: #1 - 99.9% of consumer products should not be  cleaned with an X-Acto knife
thua
11:14 Liked how author fixed unfixable tech. And even pat it for better results. 😄
Expanding battery life is possible! 12:17
apple vision glasses when?
Image if Apple found and error and recalled them all, how would you feel then? JRE
Had to turn down the volume during the scratches. That shit hurt!
Apple seen the ready player one movie poster and literally said we like that look
Anyone else have a school planner in 3rd grade made with the same material (10:02) as the front lens and annoy your teacher making sounds with it all day? 😅
This cost about 4 million where I'm from 😂
cool.  lemme get one.   jerry ,  you's a playa
@JerryRig Everything I'm a big fan.please if u have stuff like these which we can't afford and still usable please remember us....from Zimbabwe with love ❤.
-800 $ plastic ...i mean glass 😂
Be gentle he says as he destroys it very calmly.
Again how much is this thing🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Cant get over Jerry destroying this by far my worst
10:01  best moment 🥰
Not in 3500 laminated days i would buy it like this. its for daily use how can you be so scratsy to make it so groovy.
Apple Bamboozles the bamboozled apple consumers once again ......
it's so hard to watch
This hurts to watch cause it's so expensive and i want one😂
This thing needs to be glass and metal with no plastic for the price
No usb c?
Imagine how thin this tech will become in the future
give me goosebumps
thats what my table look like. just without tech stuffs.
Soo painful to watch
I love that everyone is taking this thing apart and carefully putting it back together again and jerry rig is just breaking the crap out of it 😂😂😂
Can't wait for the $15,999 titanium vision pro max.
Don't know why started blowing air to the screen when the fabric caught fire with all the smoke coming to the screen
"....we start seeing scratches at level 3, with deeper grooves at level 4" QUICK! TO THE BASEMENT!
iphone has a message schedule feature using their shortcuts app
Why do i feel like tearing my heart with knife
Rocked my socks😅
8:56 Bro cutting towards his locked out thumb gives me shivers
Jerry, I want to replace my Android phone with an iPhone, is it better to buy 15 pro or pro max?
New chanell Tom assembles everything.
Plastic garbage for so much money🤮🤮🤮🤮
Do what I do😂rigeverything😊!!!
Grand Canyon level grooves.🤣🤣 You are the best bro❤️
the only review i was looking forward to watch
Next stop, eBay:  "Perfect condition, just opened to see if it works"
Yes!!! The video everyone has been waiting on 😂🎉
Imagine watching this vid in your vision pro 😂😂
i was shocked that the front glass had a plastic cover on the outside. But the Lenses too?? that's a HUGE design flaw for a revolutionary product like this.
Freaking hate videos like this you can just tell buy a device and everything that it was not going to be scratch proof and stuff like that so there’s no point for a video like this wreck. Something that was in perfectly good condition.
Congratulations!
This was hard to watch considering the price N5 million naira😢😂😂😂
This time you hurt me... 😆
Jerry the God of A.I War
I love how he hasn't made a teardown of the Oculus Quest, but took the opportunity and spent 3500$ to dunk on Apple for the plastic on the outside
Oh my god! Zeiss lens 😭😭😭😭😭
The Apple ecosystem is solid as long as you don't try to customize things too much and start jailbreaking or using it with Windows or Android devices. Of course their build quality and satisfaction is great, or at least attempts to be great
I really hope you understand that AI is watching
ifix - how to disassemble apple vision pro... jerry - how not to disassemble apple vision pro  me an intellectual - this is fun !
I hate you, I love you too, but I also hate you
3:37 am. It was worth it.
The Ending was Nice :D
Salli salliyaa norukkittaane😢
00:04 Apple Vision Pro's surprising build quality and comfort 01:41 Apple Vision Pro has scratchable plastic surface, costly to replace 03:22 Apple Vision Pro has a plastic outer layer, making it more vulnerable to scratches and impacts. 05:06 Use soft cloths to clean the lenses and be cautious with the housing material 06:42 Apple Vision Pro is not designed for repair 08:22 Removing the Apple Vision Pro's cover glass. 10:17 The Apple Vision Pro is a groundbreaking device with advanced hardware and innovative features. 11:54 The Apple Vision Pro's battery pack capacity may seem small, but it has a high watt-hour that provides about 2 hours of runtime.
Savage!
Too violent 😂
Thank you for doing this, we now know more in depth knowledge regarding this new product.
"tears of lonelyness" 😂😂😂😂 Also seeing Jerry destroy stuff you can't afford is kinda painfull
Why Jerry Why 😂
Obligatory comment for the algorithm 😂
I almost saw the Tim Cooks face during destroying this $3500 tech...
In a couple of years we will laugh about this big glasses.
Nice presentation, but I cannot undersand whats the meaning of scratching the metal surfaces of every device you test.
I shiver everytime he scratches with the razor blade 😵‍💫
There is a certain level of satisfaction you can get from Zack.
Getting bored of hearing 'rocked my socks' etc. For 3.5k+ it's bound to be extra sparkly, but it's still just VR.
Best teardown I've ever seen
8:08 you can schedule texts on iPhones
It killing my to see how destructive you are
The unluckiest Apple vission pro
I appreciate you alot for using metric <3
The first ever JerryRigEveerything video that actually is painfull to watch 😂😂
another device to control the masses, dangerous technology.
This channel is everything wrong with consumerism. You destroy a product for YouTube views. Its like watching a Neanderthal reviewing modern technology. You can test something without destroying it beyond repair. But i guess that does not bring in those juicy viewers right?
🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣💔
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I currently watching this at 2:29 am
I totally didn't expect this video😮
Not designed to be repaired and designed to be a paperweight in 1.5 years
This one was hard to watch. Even for an Android user
what about asymmetrical face. one eye will be a lil up and thr other a lil down
OMG 😢😢😢😢
The amount of times he said 'apple vision pro'😑
Dude that was sooooo satisfying the last thing that you did  in video is sooo 😂😂😂😂😂
Apple should install a sprinkler system on apple vision pro, after this video
I feel like the vision pro is one of the very few things that apple got right and wouldn't complain about the pricing
disrespecting all the slaves work going into this
Your calming and soothing voice over vs the Meham you unleash on tech products.....EPIC😂
Glass will be too heavy...
"The rubber's probably there to help keep moisture, makeup, sweat and tears of loneliness from entering the motorized internals." 🤣🤣🤣
Plastic, lol. not even gorilla glass, overpriced device.
i feel bad watching this
I have scheduled messages from ios 17.4
The only visionary about this Apple Vision Pro is how much Apple charges you to look like fool 😀
most painful video ever
Scheduled text messages.
" Tears of Loneliness " I felt that
Coming soon: Dbrand teardown lens protector sock.

Lately the bias against Apple is breathing through so much that although subtle, it’s getting a bit on the intellectual grumpy grandpa from the village than an impartial tech lover.. it’s getting personal it seems, bye Zach 😂
at least him breaking it will spare me time of going through all that  Thanks...
Whaaaaat.....??
its 3:25 am and i have school, but i rather watch apple users pain
Holy hell, seeing that tech at 10:00 is impressive. This is Apple pushing boundaries. It's obscenely priced, but cutting edge.
This was so messy 😂
apple "we've made the most durable phone ever"  Le jerry * "I'm about to end your whole career"
Oh but it is going to be a flop. While it might have good software, the use case isn't strong enough and the price is too high.
it's PREMIUM APPLE plastic. huge different. they look the same feel the same act the same, but dont priced the same.
I am shocked he destroyed this thing after using it for only 2 hours. The geek in me would require an extra few hours of fun with the toy before taking it apart. Or buy myself a 2nd one to use after destroying the 1st. But thanks for doing it for our entertainment!
It’s sad that Apple does this kind of premium shit that no average person can buy.  I’m sure they have payment plans that don’t require you to pay in full up front but to offer a product in the VR sector for 7 times the price you would pay for any of the other already established brands like oculus / PlayStation brands all because you possess the Apple logo and have higher pixel density is just sad ….  7 .. times.. what you would pay… for any other VR helmet all because your OLED screens are better and you have the Apple logo on them.    Disgusting. Truly.   If this shit retailed for anywhere from $800-$1000, millions and I mean millions of more people would insta add it to their shopping carts and it would sell much much much abundantly.  How many of you saw the price and ridiculed this garbage company for it? I know I did . (Of course the more financially stable people would catch an eye to it) but the regular joes like myself don’t even ponder grabbing this shit.    Again.  A price mark down to $1000 would maximize their profit from this as millions millions more would find it more affordable. They fumbled.
The love of a thousand grandmas you really got me Zack😂
😭
Can't wait to see cheaper more repairable variants by other smartphone companies.
Plastic sucks for durability, but real glass might have been an issue regarding weight. Anyone knows, if other VR/AR headsets use glass instead?
The fact there is a zero day exploit is insane lol
It's hurt me 😢
Facebook marketplace resellers be like:  "lightly used"
Apple products cost consist of: 95% Apple logo, 5% product itself.
I like your work. But it’s sooooo hard for me to watch because just hate seeing these devices get destroyed 🤦🏾‍♂️😅
bro really tried to put it back together 😂😂😂😂😂
Poor build material for the price
where is the put back together part?
Bro damaged his thumb 😂
Here we go again 😅
Crafted with the love of a thousand asian orphans that is.
knowing that this vision pro cost 3500$ it's painful to watch it's teardown.
Bro noooooo. This so painful............
JerryRigged the whole thing Up!!! ❤
Review meta quest 3 durability test 😢
Jerry please rigs iQoo12 for us your fan
Though apple isnt technologically innovative they're the most design innovative company in the tech world and really force others to innovate to keep up, so I'm glad to see such a beautifully designed product.
I just can't believe Jerry burns 3500$ just like that 🙈
jerry is a savage😂😂😂😂😂 no srews ease peasy jerry rig it😂😂😂😂😂
i just wonder how can this junk cost $3.5k....
What if nothing makes a vr headset it would look like this 11:31
soo, apple found the recipe to make plastic feel like glass and charge 699$ for it? Cool.
It hurts my soul to see tech destroyed:(  Though its really cool to see how the device works) Iphones and Galaxy, meh, its ok, but at $3500 a piece for the vision pro I m physically wincing when you just rip it apart with a knife...
Jerry destroy Vision pro😂
Jerry never disappoints us
scratch that lenticular lenses again i will find you... i want to say i don't have sensory issues... but by god i hate that sound with a passion. it just feels like spiders down my spine. Very good video though loved the step by step process as you made your way inside. though the way that the band melted really does not lend credence to their claim of 70% yarn.
tear down !!!!!!!🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
I can't wait for tech like this to be casually disregarded and shit on in 100 years, like we do with atari and n64 graphics today
Gonna be honest they would have twice the amount of customers if they just looked into VR gaming with that beast
Any Indian.
In terms of content creator, I find you to be most original, skilled, and intelligent! I believe in the name of influencers we have so many people now making videos just for the sake of it. When it comes to the usefulness and REAL CONTENT if there is any contest I will always vote for you!!   Thanks so much for the genuine and original stuff that you have been producing all these years!
Bro casually destroying $3500 tech uff....makes me wanna scream
Regarding accessibility, accommodations are already available. Instead of using your eyes, you can set the Vision Pro to use your wrist, head, index finger, or voice to navigate.
When I saw that band on fire, I felt myself trying to blow it out 😭
Got me at tears of Loneliness.. hahahaha 😂
Thats the materials you get for three THOUSAND five hundred dollars!?! For that money it should be like saphire glass everywhere... Not plastic. Plastic would be fine if it was $350...
3500 for this plastic crap ow dear 🫠🫠🫠
Ahh yes, I love glass and plastic mixed screens! It scratches AND it breaks, the best of both worlds!
that scratching.. I keep coming back to get my shivers fix.
This is crazy
Pointless product
3.5k for plastic lenses, plastic front cover and polyester headband.  Wow. This is a new low point for apple. I already knew this was a overpriced and under teched vr-headset, but holy cow, why does apple package that in such low quality materials?! My quest 1 has a better build quility than this. Don't get me wrong, the Quest is a piece of garbage too, especially the software and company that sells it, but at least you don't scratch your lenses if you think a little bit too edgy.
Funny that you do something so extreme like this lmao. No one is gonna take a knife to the 3500 apple VR, this legit is pointless and just a way to get views very pointless!
Trust me, a notice is waiting for you from uncle Tim
Someone going make big money from front screen protector
No repair 😅 = Apple 😢
Thank you for destroying techs! ❤ From Heart with Love!
Man if that was a one plus phone the screwdriver probably would have went through the phone 😂
Damn the ifixit teardown looked so effortless😮
It hurts 😢😂
Makes me think... What if JESUS RIGS US?
Bro the pain I am feeling!!!!!!
brooo 😅
Finally a worth video😂😂
Only apple could make the 4 pins required for a Battery Management system into 12 pins with a proprietary plug...
isn't this front panel literally the worst of both worlds? Not fully plastic, so it won't shatter, and not fully glass so it won't scratch easily? WTF is the point of this thing, ripping clueless apple fanboys after inevitably it gets damaged somehow?
9:27 Scratches like plastic and shatters like glass... Worst of both worlds, classic Apple engineering.  I'm convinced at this point Apple can sell a turd with their logo for 5k and people would still buy it.
11:32 - a perfect example of someone that used one whilst driving and crashed their car ........ and the Apple Vision Pro
$3500 hahaha I'll pass.
Jerry you're a LEGEND :D 3.5k ruined is such a short time :D
If you look at ifixit teardown, it is a protector
wait a min! he is destroying the thing and here I am I cannot afford it!
Is he the only one noticing the removability of the cable from the battery? 😀
apple is watching this 😅😅😅😅😅
Well that was an uncomfortable watch, I felt money cry 😂
This is not the iFixit that I was looking for. More like iBrokeit.
turn it on without the lens
This is awesome 😂 I stopped using apple at ipod classics lol
I wonder how many videos you make can buy a vision pro
Jerry back at it again making Apple Cry themselves to sleep!
can the anker charge the vision pro though? 🤨
nooooooooooo 😢
This was so hard to watch
This serves no educational purpose whatsoever
Thermal past need to be replaced time to time right ?  So there no way to avoide 299 / 799 doller in repair
So you gonna put them back together? Lol
Could you do the quest three
I think I'll just buy a HoloLens 2 at that price. Yes, I don't shut up about it... BUT IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING. Okay really though... This goes entirely against the whole right to repair thing Apple wanted. We NEED replaceable lenses and front "glass". Not replaceable by 1 company, actually serviceable, good parts. Then I can see this thing dominating, and only then.
Please show what is inside the battery box and reveal the mystery why it's so big for it's small capacity.
iFixit disassembled it without killing it, you just went in and murdered it 😂
Imagine that chip heat being blown all over your face...
Cant't state with how much excitement I waited for this video
1966 ,Pete Townsend wrecks his expensive guitar ,live on stage and continues to do that for the next year or so. A guitar that I could have loved ! Enter Jerry
With deeper grooves at lvl 1 😂
My heart stopped 😭
3500$ and not even controllers xD ....
Imagine you are Tim cook and you  watching this💀
I was waiting for the vision pro battery teardown too.
Am I only the only one that skips 10 seconds every time he starts scratching stuff with his knife lol.  I hate that noise so much it makes me cringe 😅😂😂
he dont have a heart
Big oof! A fingernail is 2.5 on the Moh scale! Other plastics might scratch it... so almost anything in a household will scratch it. Anything outdoors will most assuredly! This can be worn outside, but reaaaallly should not. Yikes!!
Just as much garbage as you can expect from Apple, garbage for a lot of money. You can hate me here as much as you want, Apple users, the fact that your devices are garbage will not change.😂😂😂
most devastating teardown so far
I think you are GOAT of dismantling
I especially like that you can scratch the shit out of the front of you're 3500$ face computer by setting it down on a desk or table without the 200$ sock on the front of it, F apple.
The people walking around with such technology in public or sitting on a crowded train will eventually be targeted by thieves. Sure most thieves won’t be able to run off with the connector. But all they be interested in is the headset and if they trip over with it. Well they will still be sold on eBay at a discount by said thieves.
I will copy your channel….making millions destroying things is something everyone can do
no counter weight, too bad
$3500 for plastic product😂😂😂
A girlfriends guide to revenge
too painful to watch
Hope Apple doesn't get broken by watching this tear down and break other half of the apple logo to depict it 🤣🤣🤣.
I hate Apple
I wanna see Jerry go snowboarding with those😂
8 years ago The Simpsons predicted the Apple Vision Pro Season 28, Episode 2
Cool
it only matters if the camera area gets scratched otherwise it doesn't matter if the outside is scratched You won't be able to tell when you're wearing it
Another proprietary cable? Not surprised
😢😢😢😢😢😢
This remind my chilhood
can you make a knife that complies with german regulations? the current one is unfortunately illegal in germany because you can open it one handed :/
If people want to see a teardown in which the thing doesn't get destroyed, watch phone repair guru's video.
So it is designed to easy scratch it just by cleaning it to buy new one.
Scratches at a level 3.  Yep, definitely sounds like Apple to me.  It's practically saphire.
10:08 Not that sounds damn it, i just spat out my coffee.
Facebook made a big mistake letting down Meta platform in last 2 years ...
Me watching this at 3AM.
*the tears of a thousand grandmas*  Sweatshop workers: "Yes."
This is depressing
So this dude buys two of every launched apple products ,one to destroy and one to use…Right?
Wie interessant
It's super neat hardware, but as a product, I'm not convinced. Apple is promising the future of computing, but it doesn't seem to actually do anything meaningfully better as opposed to Apple's other game changing stuff they've introduced like the GUI + Mouse Combo, and the Multitouch display + Touch focused UI. It's technically excellent, but from a user experience point of view, it's a 🤷
Tear down battery pack also
روحم شکنجه شد
Someone said when will jerry destroy vision pro
Been waiting on this one
Wear the headstrap as a jockstrap
I think when people complain about how unrepairable Apple products are, I kinda just assume because of the tolerances and build quality of their devices are just so crazy, if they were to be more repair friendly they would be more bulky and less appealing to the eye.  And how the heck does anyone figure out how to make something like this? No wonder it costs the price of a car.  Ill just wait until this price goes down and this thing becomes used and has regular support and lots of apps and games.
Ahhhh that should buff out.....
$3500 slip through the drain 😂😂😅😅
12 ms is just wow. This works better than a stormtrooper's helmet.
Straight to #1 Trending and possibly the highest viewed video on the channel within the first 24 hours?
So we went from scratches at level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8 to scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4 in one week, well that’s a real evolution.
Butcher 😮
спасибо что показал как разбирать и я смог добавить смазки в вентиляторы
you are destroying it bro (But that is tooo much expensive Bro )
I think I’ll watch for a SE version 😂
This is my first Apple Vision pro video I watched in youtube since its release ... 🤣And, I liked it more than those who did usage reviews
Waiting for the D Brand case/skin
Now try putting it back together...
People crying: "its too expensive" People crying: "its too heavy" Yet same people crying: "include heavier and more expensive materials"
$3,5k and it scratches at level 2… Apple, really?
so satisfaction video
So you could break this thing pretty easily and make it useless, if you just lay it down on a rough surface. Nice
I came
If Apple is watching this, they are probably crying. Or at the very least, have been wincing the whole time. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Next time please keep scratching sound out of videos... it's really bad
I can't look at him destroying it and I wish I was also rich to buy it, i must leave this hurts.
Why am I smiling so much watching this thing getting destroyed?
I was born completely blind in my right eye with perfect vision in my left eye, I wonder if I can use something like this without problems. I can play VR games just fine. Can I just buy a monocle for half the price? Lol
GOD i hate that sound when you scratched that alluminum
gah damn this was intense
Using black thermal paste is such an Apple thing to do
“Tears of loneliness” 🤣🤣🤣
Forgot what we all now know and see with technology today, and look at this product being opened up with naive eyes (or eyes from the 1980's and earlier. Then, if you were told this "thing" cost five million dollars you would most likely understand and not think it was overpriced. All the different things in it and all so small, it was unfathomable in the recent past.
6:40 you've hurt yourself again, haven't you?
Babe wake up, new tear down just dropped
The iPhone kinda does have scheduled SMS via the shortcuts app
Hmmm. Imagine that. More overpriced trash from apple. Keep giving them you're money everyone. Its fiiiiine....
I have never been more impressed from a tech device. Engineering and design of this thing is insane to me.
Destruction 10/10 Script 10/10 Voice 10/10 Apple 0/3500
Ready Player One! vibes if it for gaming.
Where's the speaker teardown of apple vision pro @jerryrigeverything?
Tim Cook when watching this video "I don't like this guy"
So satisfying ▶️
You have way too much fun doing that 😢😂
For the Price of this they should at least have put Sapphire glass in the lenses
I do not understand why would anyone buy this.... its a dystopian nightmare for me.
Wow... Excellent video as usual When I wasn't shrieking from the metal on metal scraping... 😵‍💫 I spent the majority of the video wondering how you would recoup the $3500... I still haven't figured it out 😞
U forgot to stresstest the battery by shooting some nails in it.......come on Jerry do more then the half job😂
u were right initially still: apple lost it's mind. that thing is nothing but food for yt tech outlets and rhey seem to pay good.
I have been waiting for over a week now! 😅
Poor Apple Vision Pro 🫠😂
Edge runners reference🚨🚨!!!111!!
Bro is such an Apple chill. Evrrything Apple = great, everything Samsung = bad.
$250 product for $3500... what a bargain!
Jerry heartlessly scratches some cool tech. Me few years ago: 😭 Me now: 🙂
You do know ur a beast?so glass is easy for you.
When sapphire turns to be glass , and glass turns to be plastic.
very cool product, but this seems way too fragile
I bet Apple never wanted it to be scratch proof. They must have a plan to sell scratch proof covers for few hundred $
Who else watches and tell himsel I could still take it at this point 😂? Till it’s too late
Zombie era incoming…
Shear stupidity of this "disassembly" is painful as sound of knife scratching at some surfaces. Wet dream of Apple haters with ADHD and some other disorders or those who can't afford this thing. What logical reasoning is behind producing eco waste from few thousand buck worth hardware on the instant? As I get why and how iFix it does it's teardowns  - but this is completely unnecessary and lets be straightforward- stupid.
When you have more money than you know what to do with.
Oh my факинг god. It's really happening.
they're selling you " personality " on a plastic frame at 3500$ !!!!!!, STOP BUYING APPLE'S CRAP.
Zack, I thought this was one I wasn't going to be able to watch, but the amount of respect you gave to it verbally whilst annihilating it was quite moving, one of your best in fact!  I agree with the accessibility, hopefully that will change very soon.  Was there any point in this teardown when you realised "holy shit, this is my job!"?
So is this product anything more than a phone on your face
Yes. Please add more hardness scale. Would love to see things shatter more. Love the vids
That battery pack was a big f you from Apple theres no reason for it to be that small 😂
I hope apple gave it to you for free, because this junk is worth max $200
This is the first video I've seen of yours, and i didnt expect you to slowly destroy the headset 😂 subbed
using plastic instead of glass, boss move. smh
Scratches at level 3 deeper grooves at level 4 😂
you'd think for how much it costs they would use better materials and not make it to be easily broken.
For people that have an apple vision, pro or any other AR/VR headset don’t clean the lenses with a dirty microfiber cloth. I accidentally did that on a Meta Quest2 and scratched the lenses only used a brand new microfiber cloth to clean the lenses
Did you know that if you used a simcard tray remove pin poke the tiny holes near the right & left handles they will pop up easily?
Why would they put glass behind plastic? Just to make the headset heavier? It doesn't give any scratch resistance as we saw...
You have such beautiful hands! 😍😍💗 I’m in love with you, I think🤣
my god the goods are scary when they know Jerryrig Re buying!!
Holy moly thats a lot of paste… 😂😂😂😂
Dude… u crazy ❤
Best review on whole internet. No shits around just facts. :)
Why even have glass in the front cover if it’s going to have a plastic outer coating?
@A2D
i hope the apple care helps after you completed the postmortem.
tears of loneliness - that was good :D
The speakers are also removable, you can use a sim ejecter tool like u did for the battery I suppose you already know…
Jerry is the "Jack the ripper" of tech products :D
Seeing him smash $3500 breaks my soul.
Expensive operation of Apple and vision pro died in Jerry Rig table. Part of the world people can never see it buy it and he completely ripped off this tech 😔
Best teardown I've ever seen 😁👌🤪
Apple can't go a day without making a new proprietary connector
There was no "Let's get started" intro
Nah bro the part where you scratch the aluminium had my ears bleeding
hahaaha this is going to be one of Jerry's popular videos again...ouch 😅
Imagine Zach walking into an Apple Store with his Vision Pro and Apple Care to request a device replacement after this 😯
Knitted by the love of thousand grandmas and then burnt up by the heat of a big lighter😂
"The Grand Canyon level grooves" Never thought there would be a time of my life, where I get to hear that.
I have been waiting for this
“Knit by the love of a thousand grandmas” 😂
so did you get a cowid booster this month?
Tears of loneliness 😂
:)
how are you not afraid of cutting your thumb
Got me itching all over man!!!
Everyone:- the cable is permanently connected to the battery, Jerry:- the cable is removable with a sim tool Lol
Just here to read comments 😅
So the heat is directed by the fams away from the chips directly towards the user's eyes? ... Wow 😮
Yooo seeing him destroy these $3500 goggles is beyond mad an low key pissed me tf off like why did he jus go to   Town on this gadget 🤔🤬😩🤦🏽‍♂️ all in the name of research I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️ lml 🤣🤣
It's my first time watching one of his video and I'm in literal pain 😬😬
Wow Plastic by a 3500 bucks part... nice apple we pay your name but not your hardware
Sad to say but it was probably knitted by a 1000 little Chinese kids.
This physically painful to watch.
Bludddddddddy Hell 😮🔥 JerryRig never disappoints...
chill bro😭
$3500 🚽
That aluminum surface scratching is my new phobia
I have autism and certain sounds are extremely uncomfortable for me, including the sound of metal scratching metal and glass (or laminated glass) so I had to watch this on mute with captions.
Waiting for your video to decide whether should I not buy it or should I defenitly not considering it
The not so glass front is gonna get scratched a lot!
Haha… somehow you do look like Murphy while wearing the vision pro.
Not designed to be repaired, which means AppleCare is a must to be included in its price.
The easiest teardown
Man this is insane but needed ... yooooooo this is crazy the way you rigging that 3500 dollar piece of work is disturbing
Bunu da yapmazsın bee 😢
9:00 he said one piece
I'm going to need that VR headset back once you are done with the video😅
Another Ewaste product by Apple for the ultra rich
Just 13 min and 3.5 lack spoiled 😅 Jerry will never stop 😅
I appreciate you covering accessibility but I was also interested if you have eye disabilities
Everyone should honestly do this when they get their Apple Vision Poo goggles.
I have never been as excited in the last 6 years as i was when i found out apple was producing VR. watching you destroy 6 year's of happiness has brought me even more of it
😳😳😳
The only enjoyable Apple Vision Pro video
Don’t forget accessibility for people with Strabismus (lazy eye) especially with how you need to look and click. Some eyes don’t look in the same spot and can get very messy depending on what eye the person is using as their dominant eye.
this is how true android fans look like
$3500 &  PLASTIC :))))
"Tears of loneliness" saddest frikkin comment
😂bro shows no mercy
Can you please sit on it and see if it breaks
I appreciate you mentioning accessibility. Picking up tenodesis grasps seems like a next possible addition and maybe even eye tracking plus voice commands. I had a high SCI about three years ago and it’s been comforting to see YouTube videos of you and your family 😊
Can't wait for the knockoff's
Your calm/clear voice holds 50% of the channels value.
He's doing a heavy duty and has a high burden to carry. My heart bleeds each time, some tech gets torn apart. But it's for a good cause...be strong...
Wow surprised he did this but so glad he did at the same time. I still think it's overhyped and over priced
I’m in so much pain he is destroying the equivalent of a small car in a few minutes
8:49, hahaha
😦😧😮…NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Donate it to me Before destroying things 😢
Apple pulling a Samsung move
RIP my dream
Feels like it was knitted by 1000 grandmas 😂👍
Jeery NCAP😂
That black plastic is 800$ 😂
Facial computing 💀💀💀
I won't need to be, because no matter how much Apple tries to get me to buy it, I won't, because it will flop.
You didn’t scratch the battery 😂
iFixit was very clean with this, surgical.
you really broke it
@ 7:04   Fans inside the unit is crap.   Just imagine when dust and dirt gets trapped in there.  Not to mention when the fans fail and or makes squealing noises.
I am still baffled by the fact that main thing, that you're supposed to make bulletproof for that money and you have to look through constantly is made od plastic.
1st video in my recommended feed, and I saw the title and literally gasped 😂
I did an insight check... The collective production cost is 2200$ if you opt for high quality material, which they did not, some of the materials are low, some are middle some are high, mostly the outside is high... So the actual Price for this console is around 1400$ at MOST... The most expensive parts are the chips in the console while other connectors are lower quality than I expected which lowers the total down to 1100$... They probably have a few deals going on which likely still lowers this price but again... You pay for the company, not the product... Also VR is being overtaken soonish anyway so I don't know how worth it is investing in any of it right now... I mean disney just rolled out a new mat for your feet that allows you to run on the spot etc which hasn't been out for commercial yet... But still Dive VR and normal VR are both a thing nowadays and Idk which will have a worthy game etc first
... but to destroy things like that ;)
Wow so cool tech inside
knowing that some apple engineers probably crying while watching just warms your heart
ow shit.. I should have worked as youtuber
No thanks. Not designed to be repaired. A no go. Why don't companies acknowledge the fact that their crap breaks from time to time. Either by wrong use (SUE) or by faulty components that they themselves bought. These are not toy prices....so why use toy manufacturing strategies. Do you want to let your meticulously designed high-end products become Nigerian (or some other third world countries) landfill? Wouldn't it feel better to be at the center of a group of independent small repair companies (cottage industries even) that urn a decent living in keeping your products alive. Volvo bought a Volvo (1800S) back with over 4 million km on the odometer. Longevity can be a mark of virtue.
If you planning to throw away those Parts, I'll happy to receive those. I'm sure I can fix  & Use  that Vision Pro. I never ever can afford one in real life 😢
Any Apple pull tabs™ in the battery pack?
im sry but i need to know do you get death threats for all the stuff you do to cool stuff ?????
توی تبلیغات این محصول ، کسانی که بر روی صورت قرار داده بودن چشم هایشان از اونطرف معلوم بود.  احتمالا این محصول قبلش داده بودن دست جری تا از متعلقات داخلش خالی کنه😅 13:28
3500$ worth video..!!
Каннибал 😂😂😂😂
My god , i got hearthache at those scratches , Bruh..
The YouTuber who can actually afford to destroy his copy
people are gonna be pissed to find out its not really glass
best job ever
Tim Cook crying in a corner after watching this 😂
I'm not an Apple fan anymore because that greed and lock-in is not for me, but the engineering on this thing is impressive. Not $3500 impressive....but still impressive
bro be like apple ? who ..x  , omfg hahaha fucked the apple in seconds.
My man really disrespected the love of a thousand grandmas by setting fire to the yarn headband they made.
Apple doesn't like this video
with all those techs, Apple failed to build in a torchlight for night walking on a dark street. 😅
Plastic for lenses is actually pretty bad ...
I can't see this
PLastic lmao....
7:13
12:13  wow that’s removable??  Mkbhd said it’s fixed in initial impressions video..
Omg He is not even hesitating.
Exceptional work yet again❤❤❤
This product is a gimmick definetly not worth 3500 US dollar, specially as first gen product
The quest 3 would be nifty to see reviewed by you
I imagine apple workers, who built this thing, watching this and going insane. :))
barang pakai buang ni produk apple hahaha
Reviewers at 9a.m.:  Developers of apps: So you are saying there are no Apple Visions Pro left?
Please do one for meta quest 3😅
Apple take decade but Jerry only need 14 minutes......
Man you should do this with a Quest 3
Awesome like apple wants to steal with these shitty lenses cheap 😅
that is a ridiculous amount of thermal paste
watching this gives me a guilty pleasure 😗
It is extremely bad for your eyes to look on displays so near, every eye-doctor can explain why. So, if you want eyes of a 85 year person with 20 very fast, go for it! 😂
My body and soul is going to be in pain for next 24 hours 😅
Nice commercial for Apple products durability and quality.
3500 for plastic goggles :)
I love Jerry's video 😂❤  Jerry when will you come to India? 🇮🇳
$3k for a surface a penny could scratch. Wow.
open the battery pack🥲🥲
I feel like the degree of destruction done to this Apple product was personal
Since you mentioning scheduled text messages I never missed that feature. Now I do.
A vision check with scraped front would have benn interesting
Apple does have scheduled text messages
Wow you really do rig everything
The contrast between iFixit teardown and this is comical 😂
Apple: I would price vision pro so high that people will take care of it so much that won't even let them get a scratch. JerryRigEverything: I exist.
That battery plug is so evil
We need a open-hardware, libre VR device. Soon it will be possible thankfully. :D
this is painful to watch
No thanks apple i don't want a frinkig fans in front of my eyes
This has to be the video where I physically felt the pain of the damage, THIS HURT ME SOOOOO MUCH
what a mess hahaha
3000 dollars is insane
This feels illegal
You need to organise your table @jerryrigeverything
Would have liked to see the JerryRigEverything treatment for the Quest Pro or even the Quest 2 and 3.
Once again thank you for taking apart this piece of tech, so we know how weak it accually is
Last few seconds was fun :D
Maybe you could cut, scratch, torched and burn a bunch of $dollar bills for the amount of 3500.00 + tax and you could save that Vision Pro to some students or someone else who can really use it to do something useful. It's just a thought.
Feels ridiculous that it is basically nonfixable even though it costs that much. There should be a law that forces companies to create products that can be fixed when broken. So much waste.. The products tech however is quite awesome and i'm curious to see what comes out in the future when these things don't cost that much anymore.
Love the reference to Ready Player One.
the grand canyon level grooves tho🤣
What's the point of doing shit to gear that you already know is going to damage it.  Have you ever actually been surprised by anything you've done?
Soo satisfying 🤩
Put it in rice will be fine in the morning
The screeching sound will be in my head for 2 days now... I actually had to mute the video to stop suffering hahaha
$300 for some piece of plastic replacement.  Apple just can't change their ways of incorporating something scummy into their products.  With $3.5K I would expect it to be gorilla glass or something stronger.
Apple fanboys are crying watching this... I bet their tears are delicious.
Aaaaa it hurts just by watching it... especially scratching on the lenses XD
Very nice
I have been both anticipating and dreading this video for weeks!    The calmness in your voice as you annihilate a $3,500 device right out of the box is incredible!
Destroying 3500$ thing wearing 10$ watch
@JerryRigEverything what do you do with what is left with the apple vision pro and other teardowns you do. do you recycle in some way?
this thing is so rertrded
Imagine being tim cook, watching this video in vision pro with tears of loneliness
لك يخرب بيتك من حالك شو عم تعمل لك عمي!
nearly $4000 for a plastic product ?   With that price it should be fully titanium.
Jerry does the best ASMR that will pop your ears 🤣
glass is glass and we know what glass does 😅
Why don't you scratch your new Tesla and destroy the batteries like you do with Apple products etc !?
I felt physical pain with every scratch 😂
❤❤❤
Imagine if the whole video get cracked after recording 😂
This was extremely hard to watch
Little accident on a thumb? 😅 6:45
3500 for that garbage
I’ve gotta say thank you so much for giving us these types of videos. To be honest, I don’t think anyone but you would have the guts to do the same thing you are doing to Apple products(unless they’re rich😂). It really helps us with deciding if we want an apple product but don’t know if it’s worth it due to its quality to price ratio. Thanks so much for making these videos.
🤪 I can't cope!   Two videos in a row where things didn't scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7 😢
6:00 agent 47 went from carefully taking part to literally manhandling the vision pro
Battery teardown?
I love paying the deposit price of a car for a plastic AR googles
I hope he got the insurance ...
When we gonna get a bunker update its been awhile?????
Apple never compromises on built quality
what will Zack do in future if companies manages to pass 10 moh scale, we hope that will happen in next 10 years
First, you make barely sapphire "sapphire glass" now you make barely glass "glass". How far we've fallen. Great job, Apple.
Hi Zack
800€ for a non Display Protection Glas... The whole thing was suspect for me but now, im sure this is another marketing bullshit like all other Apple Products. Do not buy and do not support
You can schedule text messages on an iPhone using Shortcuts. I have an automatic text that sends my husband a text at 1am that it’s time to shut down the machines and come inside for bed 😂
The real life Sid from Toy Story!! Just likes to destroy his new toys
scheduled text messagessss
Another note on accessibility, any glasses wearers are gonna have to buy special prescription lenses to use the Vision Pro, and prisms are currently not supported. Though I’m sure they have their reasons, this is still disappointing on apple’s part, given that industry standard is currently to just allow glasses wearers to continue wearing their glasses (Quest 3, Vive, PlayStation VR 2, etc.). I guess if you’ve got $3,500 to drop on a Vision Pro another hundred bucks for prescription lenses every time your prescription changes isn’t that big of a deal, but still.
Omg noooooooooo
Ouch!
I don’t even have a iphone hehe it makes me feel soooo sooo scared seeing things omggggggg
lol, the fabric isn't even flame retardant
I think the band cathing fire is the most worth noting thing.  I wonder if Apple warned about the problem, or if they're obliged to do so anyway.  That shit could spread a fire.
omg you destroyed that?
That's almost 2.5 years worth of average salary in my country and bro tore it apart in 13 minutes 🙃
Stop he's already dead
the serious issue of using these screens tied to your face is how it will permanently and negatively degrade your vision over long use - even a few hours each day will cause serious damage to your ocular nerves by staring at something far to close to your eyes which they were not meant or designed to do for such extended periods  ~  want to test that?   try threading a needle by focusing your vision - and do that for several hours straight -  and you'll be needing a prescription for pounding migraines, and within a year, even corrective glasses won't fix your screwed vision... the human eye is not built for this abuse.
Only way to schedule text messages now is a shortcut
Love it Ame el video
9:00 ONE PIECE 🤯🤯🤯🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
that really hurts😢
this video hurts me so bad but i cant stop watching
Do this with the meta quest 3 so we have a basis for comparison
Now you gotta test meta quest 3 durability.
you are so sad
I hope Tim Cook is watching. Hi Tim!
8:08 you could have a server send you a message, and have Shortcuts react to that by sending another message, but yeah.....
At that price, I’d at least expect sapphire front glass, or hardened tempered glass.
The only device that i enjoyed getting destroyed.
This was for sure the hardest episode to watch 😅
Deepergrows At Level 7 😢😢😢
but whyyyyyyyyyyyy??????????????????
The disrespect is crazy!
Okay you're right about everything but watching an object being destroyed at that cost makes me feel bad 😢
Well jerry bro your best it is not that durable and 3500$ are total waste of Money apple technique to make more Money gold digger apple
tell me you're wealthy without telling me you're wealthy
He behaves like a robot
You should have shown the insides of the battery as well 😅
cool
So the Z Fold screen is more durable than this? Really?? 😂
"some men just want to watch the world burn"
At least it didn't bend /s
Jerry never disappoints🩵
i zavli yanni ty vision pro chi
Thanks for doing this for us!😊
It's hurting. Seeing my dream gadget in this condition🥺💔
this dude literally burned $3500
Ooooucchhhh!
Do you speak like that normally or just for youtube?
Big brain move by Apple to put a plastic cover over the front glass that’s not supposed to be removed
❤
Scratches so easily. They did it on purpose so that after a year there would be a lot of scratches, even with careful use.
Would love to see the battery getting obliterated, for science ofcourse
Apple cheaping out on stuff that would be important to the userexperience and the durabilty of an expensive product? Colour me surprised.
Tears of loneliness
…and tears from what!!! 😀😀😀.. gosh we are people are gonna be more lonelier than ever.
I will just wait 10 years to buy this
Jerry pushing away stuffs on the table is what we need to do with toxic people
The worst ASMR I ever seen 😣
how many people will melt these on their stoves?
Welp..I’ma need to see this man do a Cyber truck teardown now.
I wonder what nomad sculpt could do with this. or even gravity VR.
Watching this video gave me a sense of both anxiety and satisfaction
Instead on tearing down these gadgets, do some giveaways please!!
Yeh...finally someone destroying most hated product of the year...(Because we cant purchase it)
AWESOME videos sorry I’m sooo late
Plexiglas basically
Scheduled text messages can be achieved using Shortcuts. Tho you have to do some basic workflows to do it.
What about the speakers? I was waiting for you to rip that off too.
You would better give this money to buy and send food to starving kids
I can feel the pain in my all senses just looking at the video, this video hurts😰
How many times did he say “apple vision pro”
"Scheduled text messages" 🤣🤣🤣
It seems useless to me.
1:11 The love of a 1000 grandmas 🤣
Like for those who keept puffing the fire inside their minds
I have to watch the video twice back 2 back....
Apple does have scheduled text messages. Using the shortcuts app under automation. 8:04
The apple vision pro is unable to mess with Jerry's hairstyle even with or without the solo knit band . 💀
I would have used it in a different way if i have it 😔😔
Apple caught us off guard with the scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4.
13:26 😂
OASIS is near..
made the exterior lens from plastic so it can be scratch easily and need a specific temperature in order to replace the lens...PRO gamer moves Apple😂
Imagine paying 3500$ to have a plastic screen and lens 💀
This one hurt.
What happened to your right thumb in the middle of shooting? Black tape all of a sudden made me go back 5 seconds to see if I missed something 😅
🎉
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂😂
it was knitted with "love" of thousands chinese kept in basement
When will apple learn regarding proprietary cables? Fml
It's ridiculous they give you another new lighting port but not compatible with existed one. That means you have to charge the thing with the powerbank attached, also there's a power conversion rate between house eletric, powerbank, and product itself, not to mention the powerbank itself has low life cycle. Very eco-friendly, very Apple.
Agent 47 dismantling enemy tech :D
3500 earth dollars for a childs toy. Tomy made games like this you held to your eye bach in the 80s.
First videos I watch in 2024 & funny af ! Definitely gonna be watching your videos 😂
So the thing about battery pack is true😮
Plastic outer cover and interior lenses for 3500$?  Apple can choke on a fatty 😂   No freaking way this makes zero sense unless you have no financial sense.
yep that adds upto 3500 $
I don't really know why you're reviewing those things and nobody's gonna buy them or use them give it up
$3500 for an overpriced plastic lensed VR headset.  What a scam.😂😂
$3500 to look goofy as hell in public. the future will at least look funny to poor normies like me. free entertainment.
apple after watch this: 😖
It Extremely Hurts The Whole Community of Tech Lovers
He is atleast going to make 500000$ from this 3500$ destruction.
Wait till it rains😂
2 months rent decimated in 13 minutes.
Plastic everywhere makes replacement parts easier to make, right? So this means that Apple cares about repairability for their products, right?  /s
total destruction........in the name of science
gruesome
Agent 47 is back on the job
Jerryyou are nightmare to apple and samsung😂
Now that I think about it why doesn't winking do a function/alternate click? I feel like its a unique enough but also easy facial expression that could be interpreted by the Vision Pro.
There's a lot of metal scratching in this, that sound makes me queasy
can I have it for skiing? -- y.... 6:02 I will consider it.
Maybe Apple should work with Elon Musk’s Neuralink to develop a direct connection to the brain!
10:05 The sound looks really good. I will buy Vision Pro for that sound alone.
Very expansive video
thanks for calling out apple paid reviewers like iJusting and MKBHD. Shameless people still encouraging people to buy shit
Watching zack destroy the apple vision has made me feel new things I didn't know I would... hurts 😂.....but thumbs up for that
3.500$ 😂😂😂😂😂
He knows how to do toxic reviews of Apple products.
This is so stupid of apple I will never getting a apple products I am a android user for life
After watching this channel for years I still cringe every time expensive tech gear meets the razor blade.
Посмотреть бы на лица тех кто разрабатывал и собирал Vision Pro))
Show us inside the battery! Would love to understand why maH so small in relation to size 🤓
I’m here for the scratch test
That head strap will get so oily and dirty after a few weeks of "face time". They should include a 24-pack of disposable grease pads and a packet of sanitizing wipes so friends can jack into the metaverse without sharing bacteria and sebum.
I like it when you say it
13:28 trying to find more hidden screws by double tapping 😂
So the inside screen is basically from a 70s View Master lol
Him scratching the lenses was genuinely hard to watch
What the hell is even the point of having glass in the front cover if it is a plastic layer on top. Fake exquisity is the only reason I can come up with. Even UV protection is not a valid reason because that can be done much cheaper with laminated plastic. The glass in there is completely non-functional part.
A $3500 child's toy quality product
please give me😢
It's nice for Apple that they can at least count on a few sales to YouTubers who want to fuck the thing up
6:40 Looks like your attempt also damaged your thumb 🤕
Dont lie, everyone was waiting for that
Am I the only one who thinks that this guy's whole content shtick is just wrong? Really makes me think about 1% and all that stuff, you know.
Dllm wtf are you talking about
For such a price i would expect it to be made of pure sapphire
Jarry  destroy everything's 😂😂
Destroying apple products lol
My man paid $3800 just to break his shit.
Not a fan of apple, but this is the shit they are suppose to be doing, something really innovative.
That was worse than scraping your finger nails on a chalkboard!😱
Idk who is buying this , but if im paying that price i would at least want glass on my headset , not plastic
The battery looks like it’s from 2000
Woah ! Apple is truly next level. "Laminated glass" that is as soft as plastic, yet as brittle as real glass.
Funny to see Jerry not even attempt to put that thing back together (like he does in other device videos) 😂😂
Jeryrigeverything ❌ Destroy everything ✅
Can NOT believe they used plastic for the front AND THE LENSES. Stupidest design
The ending though!
It be better if he took things and fixed them after tearing em apart but he could never do tht or could u ?
Love how he says he'll leave the software things to MBKHD😂
if you can rebuild it back  when working im morethan happy to welcome it ill use it just like that i beg please because here in uG WE CAN AFFORD such
Jerry can i just have it since it’s destroyed lol 🫣
Apple is crying in the corner 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Oh c’mon! You must really hate 🍎 to sadistically torture this $3500 VisionPro! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
That burn was right in the heart
❤
Someone send him ifixit disassembly video.
Expensive price with cheap materials lol
Paying 3000 for a vr headset that just displays your phone screen in front of your face is the dumbest thing ever heard
😂😂😂😂 Feel Satisfied
Lol with the scratch test results, it's a good thing it came with that $2000 sock.
This was by far the most painful and incredibly hilarious disassembly I saw on this channel everrr
I have been waiting for this 😂
Bro goes way to far why even buy new things and not used u take stuff other people can’t have and the  break them like some of ur test are good but this one is jst stupid u fucked it up extra on purpose 😢
please do the same to the meta quest 3
This was my favourite tear down ever …thank you
2nd time around with eye ware, this won’t take off just like the first it was trashed within months, to me it’s junk out of a box, just no need for it👍🏻
I think this is the messiest teardown ever😂, love it
Gotta love the spinal cord injury suggestions, ❤
you're like the agent 47 of tech youtubers
No scratch test
Good old electric tape as a bandaid 👍🏾
The word AGGRESSIVE is born from jerry 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
WOW!!!!!!!AMAZING 🤗
You know all the apple engineers and YouTube reviewers are watching this and thinking “why…”
maybe Jerry rig his hairs😂😂
Please do a teardown of cybertruck 💀💀
$3500 for a plastic VR headset smh
First to the key, first to the egg
this feels good. this is overpriced junk. instead i built a $6k PC with a real VR headset
VR is going to be next smartphone ONLY AND ONLY WHEN it becomes accessible to everyone like android did for smartphones. I hope MARK ZUCKERBERG and whole team of YOU TUBE uses android as a token of gratitude cause it was  because of android which allowed its software to be on cheaper phones otherwise platforms like You Tube and Facebook were only available to rich and imagine how small that number would have been. 🫤😟 i dont like apple on moral basis. Love you android we middle class/poor income earning ppl owe so much to you. 🫰😄
Thanks JerryRigs. You NAILED IT 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😊. KOBY IRELAND
Please don't wreck it
*pain*
I was waiting for this to watch you destroy this expensive peace of hardware which I can’t afford for 10 more years
Who else noticed detaching the charging cable of the battery pack... MKBHD should do more research man!
Sheesh hands off to the engineers that created this piece of engineering marvel
I  thought   about the  double  blink  feature  for those  who don't  have hands
Me for  plastic: plastic Apple,  Plastic: no it's laminated glass😂😂😂  Me for processor: processor Apple for processor: no it's bionic processor  😂😂
Wait apple shows the glasses as transparent so people can see your face. Lol
Have to say, this is an impressive piece of tech engineering! Thanks for the tear down!
As I anticipated the video is here 😂😂😂
OMG
My heart breaks every times he scratch the glass.
We been waiting for dis
Im just sad he didn't removed the speakers with sim ejector tool😢
Vison pro looks like cheapest quality product by apple
And just after few hours after I have commented and mentioned JerryrigEv on same tear down on another chanel, JerryrigEv says "HOLD MY BEER 😂😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. THANKS JerryrigEv. You never disappoint. Koby Ireland
Jerry always delivers ❤
Thank you for saving my life and money before buy this piece of $hit 🙌🙌🙌
we really need to see whats inside the battery pack.
I feel nauseous to watch him destroy all the hard work that went into make that Apple product.  Makes me feel he has no respect for people’s time.
garbage
Ok, now see if you can reassemble it😂
If that battery were in an iPhone it would be 9972mAh
Under-engineered, over-priced junk. Just like everything else Apple makes.
No repairability again, what a shame
🙏🙏🙏stop 4 Christ sake
After seeing the insides and all the small details, motors on the eyecovers etc, I do start to see why it costs 3500$ but still think it is way too much, I guess we newd to wait for the Apple Vision S or something
Glass would be far too heavy for the face
POV Apple low key watching this
🤣🤣🤣😂i have not any word
You should return it to Apple and say it don’t work no more  😅
Can't wait for the Vision 2 pro.. It's $$$$ and  Case - $$$ Pouch - $$$ Battery - $$$$ Don't worry Apple stickers will be included this time  and damn, it's free😂
wow 😯
I can't buy but I enjoy for destroy
We all knew this was coming.
vsion pro+ neuralink  realease and im moving to some tropical island
MKBHD is wrong about that cable being non removable.
I live in Australia and 3500usd is 5377.38aud and that’s so incredibly overpriced it ain’t even funny. And to add sugar to cream, only two stores in Australia are advertising it for preorder for 6349aud for the lowest storage model. Yet the Australian Apple branch hasn’t even announced it yet for its stores, that’s hilarious. But the biggest joke is, I could buy a car for that price. The Australian dollar really does suck.
much wow 3500 f dollars 😮
He really destroyed those😂
The scratches on the front remind me of the disappointment I felt when my first GameCube's logo got scratched up
I needed this
Damn … when you can destroy stuff that costs thousands $$$$. Good thing he has 8mil+ subs. He be rich right ?? 😂
only he can tear down🤣🤣🤣🤣
i hope thousands of apple fanboys are crying to this video.
watching my 1 year worth of salary getting destroyed 😢
The video everyone awaits z😊
I will never recover from this financial loss how Jerry's gonna recover this much money
Why you say this is flop please explain anyone?
Jerry needs to get arrested for this gore butchering
Tear of loneliness lololol
Imagine actually Snow boarding with these,  Crazy
Only This channel did this with Apple Vision Pro
The cringe level i got from this was insane. Thanks for a great vid! LOL
4000$ and this guy just destroying it for our entertainment 🤣 I appreciate content like this
What a waste of
Naah cannot handle this video anymore.
Ngl having laminated glass with the plastic on the outside is the worst possible way to do it. You get the scratchability of the plastic without the crack resistance that it offer so you'll scratch and shatter it if you're not careful
Feels so wrong whenever I watch him destroy expensive products
lighting the knitted band caught me completely off guard. Poor apple sweatshop grandmas.
I can't stand the blade scraping sound
Well I’m sure unless you’re less than intelligent that your goggles will not come in contact with keys or coins 🪙 let alone a scratch test/box cutter .
oohh its Already Released !? thank for reminder
Certainly a very impressive piece of e-waste.
How cool is apple vision to see it from the inside ? well jerry is the best!
This engineering is very impressive.  Destruction exposes creation.
So... this dude is out here spending over $3,000 just to mangle and destroy this thing for clicks, meanwhile people are homeless in the street.  Good job, America
All I heard was, “MUHAHAHAHA!”😈
With different outer body and lexan visor plus better software it would be a great item for military use... And maybe for guy that used to be called Prophet.
When it all goes down AI is definitely coming for Jerry.
This one almost hurts to watch.
8:08 that peace sign in the reflection of the lens had me 😂
sooo far the best butchery on this channel
Thank you for all that you do Jerry, we all appreciate you now and even further in the future
I have to admit... this one kinda hurt...
I treated myself to a meta quest 3 for Xmas. I'm in the apple eci system with ipad and iPhone. I belive you are going to technology hell to be whipped eternally with an iPhone with a casetify case in it till your buttocks drop off 😂. Entertaining video thanks😂😁👍
Holy shit that headband is highly flammable 🔥 yikes!
Apple Vision pro build quality is not as good as everyone talking about it
1:19 more likely ‘hands of thousand children’
What the hell men 😢
It's mind boggling as to how we could send people to the moon before most people alive today were born, yet the biggest and most profitable company on the planet can't figure out how to make their device user repairable. It genuinely infuriates me that you can spend a months wages on something and still can't have access to the insides. I can't help but wonder how much further along we would be as a species if we weren't literally throwing perfectly good products in the garbage because of one bad part. It's one of the main reasons I can never get behind apple regardless of what the competition is like. I detest that on principle alone
Can someone help me understand why they needed glass at all, if the outermost layer is going to be plastic anyways? The obvious, comment section answer is no doubt going to be "so they can market it as glass", but I don't buy that as the sole motivation.
Seeing the iFixit teardown of the vision pro looks like a surgical procedure. This video looks like the Saw version of that same procedure. 😅
nee manushane illa theriyuma😢
I never felt the damage he do to even device until today seeing him destroy 4000$ VR.
Gimme one 😅😅
Apple tech is bullshit, and every sane person around the world knows that already
Over expensive, useless piece of tech. The only purpose of this thing is to constrict the vision of rich kids, that's it
10:03 made me extremely uncomfortable
technology makes people stupid
saddest teardown till date.
Never felt this satisfied😁, Please rip the battery module too. if apple watching this video they defiantly blacklist the jerry.
Bro just wasted $3500 to make a video that I watch without even having money for food
Zack you should have some mercy on some products.
2:40 3500$ plastic glasses :)
Him thinking and mention accessibility…which is amazing, as it would be revolutionary alone, like we’re getting closer n closer to the movie Ready Player One.
This one was painful 💔
If I were Apple, I would not sell another unit to this guy ever!
Another banger. Nice job.
Why do they hate usb-c so hard?
Jerry I won't mind if you send me out that vision Pro 😂🔥📍
Ты реально монстр Джерри 😂❤!
would love to see more vr headsets teardowns, like the meta quest 3 or the pro for comparison
Feel bad for the the device
Does anyone else just want the battery pack as a phone charger? 😂  The engineering that went into this product justifies the cost. It is a thing of beauty, but to go from a Google Glass to a ski mask is a back slide.
Even for Apple, this is poor.
3500 USD ripped apart? JerryRig means business
Thanks For completing my wish ❤❤
Tears of loneliness 😂😂
He said my razor only cost $15 I love this guy😂
When ifixit gives an assignment to a toddler! 😂
Just glad.. Apple is not making humans.. otherwise scratches at level 1 with deeper grooves at...😂
This puts a smile on my face.
Be careful because it’s expensive. I don’t care what it’s made out of
How's your thumb mate? 😂 I saw the band aid when there was none at the start...Those knives can be dangerous 💪
Best teardown ever 😅
Would have loved for you to rip the battery pack
Whoever buys this will have to protect it with his life..
10:05 Anybody get any flashbacks of Zack scratching up that one phone that was textured in this same way? Legend has it he is still playing with the back panel of that phone.
Seeing such an expensive thing being destroyed brings me pain😢
The ski google worth the battery pack attached with a cable is a no go for me
Wrist movement is fine for some, but a wink can be even easier to produce (and recognise by those sensors) for most of us I think.
in all fairness, a 3800 dollar equipment shouldn't come anywhere near any of all you did to it. like i get it, it can fall down and crack, but even if it had an higher security glass, it falling on the ground would mess with its cameras and sensors anyway, it's kind of a loaded test, you wouldn't drop a laptop or a computer for the same reasoning, some items are just not meant to be dropped or to have any survivability upon falling damage or scratches, unlike phones which you bring outside on a daily basis.   i wouldn't suggest using this vision pro outside, for example.
Money to 🔥 I guess 😢. Rip 🥽
Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas 😂😂😂
Love the Ready Player One reference at the end lol. It’s weird and a little scary how much closer we are to a reality like the one in the book/movie with the release of the Vision Pro. Still not close at all, but it’s a start.
It was appls dreeem project you must be jail for it 😦😟😲
After many many many years of android use I finally used my first scheduled text message. I didn't even know it was there until you mentioned it in your iPhone teardown video. (I think that's where it was). Big thanks. I'm sure I'll use it many more times, and probably could have used it very often in the past.
That would be a fun story to tell the genius, Bar lol
U should show how it works without lens and glass in front
Top
In the year where we got scratches at level 7 and deeper grooves at level 8 on a $1500 phone, apple has no right to give scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4 for something that costs $3500
699640th view and 49. Something K liked😂😂😂
Prescription eyeglasses are also generally made of plastic so this is just kinda the same thing?
The weirdest tech rewiew
Waiting for a Vision Pro xray skin from d brand.
Who buys Rotten Apple`s products ? :D
Bro talks like the narrator of rudloph the red nose reindeer
Finally 🤣🤣🤣 this is scary
*knitted with the love of a thousand migrant workers
Kindly please do this to current world system😂😮😢
My heart is bleeding :(
They need to drop price to like $90 after this review.
just like a nintendo switch... a paperweight that has no beneficial or efficient use.  Apple users copenrope
I was in pain when it was being ripped lol
I love when you destroy apple products😂😂😂
Scheduled text messages?
$4000 got destroyed 😭😭
Yes, u justifie your channels name..I mean Almost U rig On Everything
If world of Tech Gadgets had a serial Killer….
Tear of loneliness lol
Can’t wait for this dude to review and praise the Samsung Vision Max, oh wait there is not such thing, maybe in two years after catching up they’ll come up with something for baldy to love.
Holy molyyyy
I can't say how devastated I am for mkbhd and Co to over read the battery voltage and call it small. It's a 3s cell with 3 4,35V pouches in serial, the capacity will not be added if the voltage is. This thing has got as much juice as a small laptop battery.
$3500 for just plastic, Apple knows how to treat their customers like pidgeons !
This was hurtful
I'm fairly certain the quest 3 is glass lenses, and yeah the passthrough isn't the best, but based on this review I'm glad I didn't save up for this headset and just bought the quest 3. The lenses and the front cover of this thing is the most important part of it. I'd much rather have a hard plastic shell than an aluminium one if the lenses are more durable
let split 3500$ in to 2$ bills love it!
MFs Apple selling plastics @3500$  wtf??
As soon as I saw the "glass", I knew it couldn't be glass. No way they affordably mass produce glass in that shape, which is quite sad to see considering its price but then I remembered... thaaaats apppleee  *Seinfeld ending plays*
come on man, what a waste
dam that was painful to watch
really great video, can't wait to see future versions of this!
Looks like you might need AppleCare on that thing😂
You mentioning the accessibility tells me that you didn’t actually explore the accessibility features. This is easily the most accessible product Apple has ever made.
I am convinced that this man does not feel pain.
One of the most Painful Videos I've watched of JerryrigEverything  IDKY
sell out
Started my day with that. I know it's gonna be a good day now! 😂😂
Anthother simulator thing. Nah I'll stick to the real world.
As Jerry mentioned, apple would definitely think about it now that they must have included the wrist gesture to enable those segment of people inclusive 😒
Jerry is the boogeyman of electronic devices
Zack will durability test a $3,500 MR Headset but won't do a Cybertruck bend test? Lettin' us down man 😔
Amazing how Apple haters still be hating.  😂
I think the biggest accessibility hurdle is the price tag. $3500 for a VR headset is insane.
Very informative and helpful. Thanks!
We really should stop measuring battery capacity in mAh. I think it was mkbhd in his unboxing video that commented on how physically big the battery is for given capacity, obviously not realising the voltage difference between it and most other smartphone batteries.
Holy **** how can they charge $3500 for this and be so cheap about using plastic instead of glass!? That is mind blowingly awful quality
very sad for Tim 😂
I couldn't help but think that Jerry was going to say Knitted by a bunch of children in sweat shops.
It’s the first time I ever disliked Zack’s video, couldn’t take the torture he put the headset through
Destroying a $3500 machine that crApple made.... 😗🤌
Your videos worth winning oscars!!!
you shouldn't have burned that band after saying it's softest most cuddliest piece of fabric I've ever felt😢
Those knives are dangerous
This is important. Let him cook.
bro $3500?!?!? i could buy like 5 oculus quest 3s with that kinna money!
There goes $3500 😔 nice teardown 🤔🫡
The epitome of the meaning tear down
Apple are very late to the party with this plastic junk in typical apple style and price tag of course
Him scratching that aluminum kills my ears every time 😂
This is the real Unboxing Video 👏👏
Так вот че за очки были у киркорова на вечеринке у ивлеевой
My heart was breaking hile he was breaking that "costs a car" headset
One of your finest destructions!
5:47 Tears of loneliness 😭😭😭
This one hurt to watch
Quest 3 one love for 650$
ppi of this apple vision pro is amazing
Okay this can be part of the gadget museum where no one would actually buy...
that costs 3.5k?
0:42 : Hitman 2077
Some chinese samsung workers might have already ripped it off
One of the most painful video for apple
Anything with apple on it is garbage
Actually it’s not plastic. At least the main outer display. It just has a plastic cover on it. To probably help in the long run with scratches and if you drop it glass doesn’t go everywhere
The way you scratch on things, I don't know what on eatch is not scratchable
Crazy
The biggest miss was in not placing the M2 computing guts into the battery brick. If they had done this, the battery brick with its computing guts could be easily replaced year over year, allowing the display headset to remain relevant for many years to come. Building it all into the headset means the entire headset will become landfill in around 2 years. It’s not like 5k displays won’t still be a thing in 10 years. Now, who said Apple is a green company?
Lol ... Jerry really Rig Everithing! 😃👍
兄弟 你真是找到了展示vision pro新的赛道
I started blowing on the screen to put down the fire  4:04  😂😂😂
Is it bulletproof
Waiting for droptest))
I wanna cry 😭😭😭
Excited to see what’s inside the Vision Pro. You can’t get any blueprints up here in heaven. Even if you’re a shareholder.
Totally useless product
Love the video. Sorry but I’ll never buy another Anker product after buying multiple braided power cords from them that all failed with zero damage after just a few months. Not a good look for a company that advertises durability
Hey Jerry, you didn't show us the speakers of these 3500 dollars VR headset ...
@4:22 Made my ears Bleed. Thanks Jerry!
guys i made it watched the whole video.
It's just a expensive gimmick
Oh shoot! I forgot to hit the record button.
What a waste of money 😂😂😂
8:54 Ripping it like a Fkin Avocado man! 😭😭
How ijustine became a thought leader in tech is beyond me. She is not smart
When I heard "seeing Apple branch out for the first time in a decade" said everything to me
800-dollar piece of plastic? Two windshields right there. Money 95 % lost.
Do you claim Apple care or just throw the device or you just pay for it and keep the broken device and the video pays for it? How does it work jerry?
3500 dollars just flown away
please submit an apple care ticket
5:50 I feel attacked 🥲
So the whole thing is pretty much trash 🗑️ 🗑️ unnecessary aluminum frame and unnecessary wannabe glass 😅 Apple charging $3500 just because!
This hurts
My soul left my body
Seeing this man destroy my dream headset is the best video I have ever seen
laught at the power cable. applecare.. :D careing about ur money.
jerryRigEver producing more E-waste 🤣🤣
So u spent $8000 to rip 1 apart then to have 1?!?!? Ok 🤷🏾‍♂️
Would bei interesting, how well the tracking works with heavy screws or even a damaged Front shield
He’s the biggest apple hater
We are one step closer in stepping into the oasis🥽
3:35 idk why but this makes me super uncomfortable
Apple products are for fools 😂
im not gonna buy vision pro cuz its plastic
It's a $3000 plastic from Space
Can you try to pull the rubber bands to see how strong is it attached to the vision pro body or just to see how pulling it may damage the speaker?
One dude did drop test glass completely destroyed from a view feet high 💀
For the one I would love to see what's going to happen when you drop it from eye level.
It makes me unreasonably angry that Apple values this thing that's actually cool as only 3.5 times what 4 wheels and a monitor stand are worth
Tim might be infuriated or getting a heartache watching this
Be gentle with this youtuber - HE CAN'T SPELL "IT'S"!!
Hearing the scratche sounds is like nails on a chalkboard
exactly a new apple product gets released :Jerryrig Gonna test it now
Why men why
Omg I know it’s ur job to dissect it. But I was feeling tense 😬
This is like watching an open-heart surgery gone wrong...
What would you rather have... a Quest 3 and I guess a Quest 2 just as a backup or the front glass for a Vision Pro?  Same price.
apple engineers cry by wathcing him destroying the vision pro
THE *MEGA*  one🥶… jerry won’t leave any item
Butcher of tech products 😂
I feel apple is slowly circling the drain.
Zack, this is one of the most interesting teardowns in a while, due to in equal parts, the device and your genuine enthusiasm and cerebral commentary.
That scratch sound was the apple engineering team squeaking in pain
Apple fanboys like this comment!
Wau, special powerbank and special cable that alone cost $200. Cool apple, another junk with one purpose.
Imagine spending $3500, just to ruin it…
Overpriced for what it does, especially if it cant be easily  maintained ,repaired (dust inside from fans, etc.), proprietary battery, weak earphones construction (you can find it from a drop test video) They  could remove all the front luxury "glass" including the lenticular lens to make it much cheaper and lighter (it does not affect its main functionality at all).  Anyway like any other VR/AR sets with similar construction it may affect your eyesight,  skin around eyes , neck, especially your eyesight  . So it's not recommended to wear it constantly for a long period.  For games and movies, it's OK. For serious work that requires physical keyboard, normal monitors accessible for several people at once , I wouldn't use it.
erughhhhhh my heart ! can you give me 1 after you destroy ?
Therapeutic
bro i just love your videos ....
thanks i hate it... makes me feel poor lol
i can't do this man's job. would be crying all the time
The act of salvaging this 3500 dollar tech is satisfactory.
Warning ⚠️: Do not watch if you are broke 😅
I don't normally feel much whenever he starts to scratch the screens of an expensive phone, but man as soon as he scratched the lenses I felt that.
God I can usually stomach these teardowns but this one legit started to make me nauseous from just how much engineering and money was thrown away lmao
1:36 looks like u need a bandage, little buddy :))
Who needs a tablet s9 ultra tear down ??
😬
05:45 "tears of loneliness" How do you come up with these phrases? My god I lost it there 🤣
To the delight of Applephobs
if you see 100 000 tech reviewers doing the same like him would be a total disaster.
.
Nice
Jerry is getting back at apple for the rest of us that can't afford their products 😂😂😂😂
aaaaargh.....
They pretty much showed it was plastic in their ‘how its made’ video
Alright you get my subscription
For 3500 I expected something more robust, but then again, with all that plastic, it's already so heavy lol.
Tim Cook will watch this?😅
Jarry: Fu*k 3500 dollars 😂
How does a MacBook screen handle your picks?
In Apple Vision Pro your UI changes when someone crosses their hands in front of your face seem that person also controlled this UI or user only allowed to access it?
There is this level of uneasy suspense knowing you are going to destroy this expensive thing.
can some body tag Tim Cook 😁😁
When you’re done destroying it , give it to me🥹
It’s not even just a computer for your face. It’s a glorified monitor for your face with a built-in iPad, using alternative input schemes. When that iPad goes out of date in 12 months with the release of the next M2 chip, it’ll be obsolete. Who wants to replace this headset every 12-24 months at $3500 per unit?
Apple Copium Vision. The quest 3 is better lol. I've got a 40000 mAh battery bank that powers my quest 2 for an additional 7 hours.
The 3 stages of grief: literally, figuratively, and economically.
I cringe everytime he scratches these expensive stuff 😅😂
I didn't think you would actually do this 😮
I think it's plastic cause glass would have been much heavier
Why do a bend test for Apple products when you didn’t do it for the S24 ultra?
I was waiting for you to remove the ear speakers. There a tiny hole that could release ig
Holy moly
iFixit and Zach did not open the battery pack. I’m curious what inside.
10:03 oh god this sound 😖
Take that apple fan boys 🤣🤣🤣
Destruction aside, the points you made about accessibility are interesting. It’s a surprising oversight tbh. That said I’d imagine if they could figure that out, it could potentially be a game changer for people who are immobile, both in communication as well as experiencing more of the world. I actually can’t wait to see what becomes of this platform.
Not gonna lie this hurt watching
“Feels like it’s been knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas” had me rollling 😂
10:03 sound made my vertebrae twitch
being gentle as always
That knit headband needs to be a cpap headband
Какой поганец, ломать не строить! хватит!
So the only task if the outer glas is to shatter on drop. No other function plastic couldn't do better.
imagine this explode already made me think twice to use it
Rip that crap😂
This is the greatest teardown of all times!
If this was an android product it would be able to survive a haymaker from god.
Zach looks like a hitman with it on imma be honest
That headstrap is actually awesome
For 3500$ this seems like a piece of crap.
This is just pure pain to watch.
Jerry have given the best way to give the specification of any device
I Think it's gonna be more worst comment here. Please Jerry clean your hands and nails 😮
What a piece of 3999$ Crap 💩no durability at all
He deserves all the success he has. Epic video.
No one will buy that $3500 thing for plastic 😂😂😂
Just gonna comment to boost this vid and hope Zach can recuperate the funds from however he got this in his office to destroy
I never miss a moment to cringe at your videos, JRE.
That was Awsome
If any other company made this, they would have criticised for the higher price tag. But because it's Apple the fans are like "it's worth every penny" . Hypocrites!
If u expect plastic in 3500$ thing dnt ever dream to buy it
I'm no math whiz, but this is about a $1500 product.
Welp Now do a 4090 😂😂
So, does it still boot?
Apple love theese video's
"Feels like it is knitted by the love of thousand grandmas" ❤
Knowing this 3500 dollar product can be ruined by any surface harder than plastic completely kills all the appeal it had for me
I’m an apple guy and this tear down made me extremely uncomfortable. Please do it again!
Vision Pro designers are probably crying right now
11:07 Why bother putting a glass in front if you can't see through it anyway...  Only to make it more fragile and make millions in repairs
Bruh
Well  we all sad to hear it is not  " scratches at level 6 with deaper grooves at level 7"  after all this time
This hurts
Somehow I feel like I will never financially recover from warching this video. Keep it up Zack! Your content never ceases to amaze me (or shock me to my core)
10:00 The best part for me <3
When you realize dude makes enough money from this video alone to justify destroying a $3500 item which is basically my income for a month 🥲
Do the Microsoft Hololens please! :D
They have scheduled text messages 😂
Why didn’t they at least make the inner lenses out of glass? I can understand the outer bit not being glass to reduce weight but the inner lenses? 😭
That was the funniest tear down of all time!
well…
Am not an apple fan .... but this is an amazing piece of tech ...👍 4 that
Thanks Zack👍🏽
It's almost like Apple almost wants this device to fail.
Ufff... Everyone said the charging cable attached to the battery pack is not removable... Jerry be like- here, hold my beer! 😂😂
Over half mill views in a few hours...  Something about Apple, high ticket items and destruction that turns my crank.   jerry rig the hell out of that thing!
Scheduled texts is the biggest thing I miss (switched against my will)
I have a feeling if Steve Jobs were still alive, we would never see this thing. I hope Apple didn’t make a lot of these. If they did you’ll see them on the discount rack soon.
|GOKU|                          ——————  Goku's physical strength feats in Dragon Ball are numerous and showcase his ever-increasing power throughout the series. Some notable feats include:  1. **Frieza Saga:** Goku's battle with Frieza on Planet Namek culminated in his transformation into a Super Saiyan, achieving a significant power boost and allowing him to overpower Frieza, who was considered one of the most formidable villains at the time.  2. **Cell Saga:** Goku demonstrated immense strength during the Cell Saga, particularly when he achieved the Super Saiyan 2 form. His battle against Cell showcased powerful attacks and a high level of combat prowess.  3. **Majin Buu Saga:** Goku's fight against Kid Buu displayed incredible feats of strength, culminating in the Spirit Bomb, a technique that harnessed energy from living beings across the universe to create a massive, planet-destroying attack.  4. **Battle of Gods:** In the movie "Battle of Gods," Goku faced Beerus, the God of Destruction. Despite ultimately losing the battle, Goku's ability to contend with a divine being highlighted the extraordinary strength he had attained.  5. **Tournament of Power:** Goku's participation in the Tournament of Power revealed new levels of strength. His ability to access Ultra Instinct, a state of heightened reflexes and power, showcased a form of strength beyond conventional Super Saiyan transformations.  6. **Broly Movie:** In the "Dragon Ball Super: Broly" movie, Goku faced Broly, a Saiyan with immense raw power. The battle demonstrated Goku's adaptability and strength, especially when he used techniques like the Kaio-Ken in conjunction with his Super Saiyan Blue form.  These are just a few examples, and Goku's physical strength feats continue to evolve as the series progresses, with each new transformation or technique pushing his limits further.      Honorable mention to when GOKU was fighting Beerus *only in SSJ GOD*    He was able to shake the cosmos of the multiverese that goes on to show how powerful he was at that time....   To the conclusion Goku's scale goes upto Low Complex Multiversal     Intotal DB has 26 separate time zones and GOKU BLACK was the one to break space time and reality between each of them   Also I forgot to mention that the DB universe alone has infinite number of stars,Galaxies and atoms in each time line of reality possibly breaking the term *existence*   And I won't even start with the NULL REALM MANGA
6:17 "quick little bend test" got me
That battery is bigger than most 20,000mah ones?
Apple makes it unreparable in order for the users to buy expensive warranties and stop all outside repair shops from fixing it. Congress needs to step in with right to repair laws.
apple cheaping out once again yet they charge alot
I cant stop thinking that i wish i had enough money to buy one of these to do this and not care 😊
I'm guessing you didn't buy apple care.....
This… hurt to watch. And just because of how expensive I knew it was
Plastic?!!!!  On areas most vital to seeing things.  That is nuts!  The darn thing costs more than an arm and a leg and they put something as junky as that on the part that will get scuffed up the most.  For everyday use I can tell you that doesn't work.  Heck I wear glass glasses because of the issues with scuffing and scratches.  I'm not an office worker that just puts my glasses on to work at the computer and then take them off when done. I have to wear mine all the time or I pretty much can't see much past my nose clearly.  I live life including getting all dirty outdoors and from practical life experience, plastic sucks.  This thing is not going to be treated as some kind of fragile egg and that fancy cover is not going to be used as intended.
can you charge the vision pro battery while using the goggles?
wtf 400k views before i started watching 600k views after if finish watching
That is another Apple trick and flap to lure their fanatics. Apple still the greediest company and the most stupid one.
Apple engineers seeing this 💔💔😭😂
5:50 Tears of loneliness😅😂😢
3:09 yeah glass is the least of the worries when it comes to damage.   Anything internal and you’re looking at near 2500 without AppleCare, however 300 (fixed) with it. Also includes battery and accessories bought with the headset.
no way he destroyed the hype around apple vision pro in mere minutes
WDUM quick little bend test Its already bended lol
Ouch .....my skin tear when I hear the scratching sound on the surface of this tech gig.
Dude put a fire on cloths and expect it not to burn !!  Scratching a glass with sharp materlias … youll scratch anything with these materials you use !!! The worst content ive watched at all ..
4:34 "The lower camera are covered with glass"? I thought it is plastic?
Definitely not worth for $3500 😅
My wallet loves you jerry. You're a wallet-safer!
Did you see that.
You say that repairability is an afterthought, but I actually think that it is one of the first things Apple thinks about when they think about launching a new product...
Finally!!! Peace Satisfaction
He did it again..
This video was incredible. Whatever you think its good or not the headset is an engineering marvel.
Every apple device should have this done to it
4:32 ya its a work of art we can paint  a beautiful scratch potrait of Monalisa😂
Did he just destroyed an apple vision😢😢😢😫
Your videos are so sick!
Can we all just give a clap to JerryRigs amazing musical performance with the front ribbed screen. 👏
There are already scheduled text messages by the way, so you might have to get a vision pro after all... :D
Jerry Bhai ke agei koi nahi❤
It hurts to watch this
This is insanely painful, more than any phone he destroyed over the years
After watching this tear down, it’s amazing how apple made that head piece. Seems so complicated.
I just can’t believe he was still purchased stuff like this, when they refuse to make their products “repairable”
I hope Tim apple is watching 😂 Love the casio by the way. Most humble YT'er
condolence to everyone that bought this...
The first person in this planet to destroy apples new toy
Dude is desrtroying a decent used cars worth of money
There is really nothing wrong with plastic. Most people think it makes something cheaper, but they need to understand that glass headset, it will shatter easily. I had a very cheap plastic phone for work (Samsung XCover 5), which fell so many times on the ground. Even from high distances, and that thing is still intact while my other phones would just have shattered
This hurts 😭
this is simultaneously painful and relaxing to watch
JerryRigKnife ... more like Husky knife recolor :D
absolute carnage
when he scratching metal with the knife it hurts my soul
The grand canyon level groves 😂😂 hits hard
NOOOOOOOO
I can't wait to one day watch this on my Apple Vision Pro. Maybe if I start saving now 2027. 😂
Is one video worth 3500?
"Love of a thousand grandmas"😊
Excellent
Dumb video. Taking a razor knife to it. DumbMy condolences being an android and pc guy. Unless of course this is supposed to be sarcasm.
I bet 500 bonus views are from a certain country thanking you for saving them the cost of purchase, to be able to make cheap copies now😅😂
So cheap Apple 🍏 products 😜 i thought this should be like smart glass 😢 joke but I'm actually excited More and more
Im i the only one who cant stand that sound 10:04 😣😣😣
It seems weird to me that for all the badmouthing of Apple products that goes on, Apple is the one paying the light bill lol
I can't relate to you as much anymore. . .you're too rich now.
Few apple vision sold, a lot of them destroyed.
Like and comment for support! ✌🏼
Jerry needs to be stopped. Setting the fluffy stuff on fire got me triggered.
bro made that plastic look like vibranium so strong lmao.
I.. I.. I could have.. used that *sigh*
Did he really use electrical tape as a bandage on his thumb blister mid way of the video lol
Apple has scheduled texts with shortcuts. Ps please buy me an Apple vision pro jerry.
Is so expensive 😅😅😅
Scratches at level 2 with deeper groove at level 3 and grand canyon groove at level 9!
Would have loved to see if the sensors still worked when scratched
The yapple vision pro
I don't expect glass to be glass when some years ago sapphire was not sapphire. And titanium coating over aluminium.
scratch my heart 😢
You ducked because of natural reflexes, not because of how good this is. Actually, we were just getting used to people talking on headsets, and now people will also touch air and pinch it. And they call it evolution. 🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious. Thank you for the review, that was as always, a good one.
waiting for the day jerry uses a level 10 pick on a phone
Will it have the battery issue as the iPhone 😅
can you do another one and then try and put it back together so it works?
🗿Thank you 😂Sri for  video
$ 3,500 worth of gadget shreds to pieces. Good content 😁
It may looks like ski goggles from the outside 🤔 but a little more complicated from the inside 😅
Biggest environmental waste on human history… 😂😂😂😂
Pretty weird to think you’re staring into two huge fans just millimeters from your eyeballs.
junk
How much space is actually taken up inside the battery pack, as it looks too big for the rated storage.
Jerry i dare you to "RE-ASSEMBLE” it  back 😂
wow, they say glass but that is by far the worst glass ever
Do battery open video of vision pro
Bro really wiped the thermal paste using the apple cloth and I'm all for it
Our brave brother ☺
Malayalikal indo guys .....ee kaalamaadan pottich kalikunath kando 😢
apple says it's laminated glass, but it's plastic. are we got scammed?
how to protec our retina?
atleast I know to never take a razorblade to something that I'll never buy
Ah, The satisfaction of costly tech ripped apart at others expense.
i appreciate you using the right mesurments units, so 95% of the people watching understands cause 95% of the globe uses metric.
11:03 I don't like apple, but holy sheesh, that is a dense motherboard layout.
😮 nooooooooo!!! Zach!!!! 😞😢
Apples engineers while watching this.Oh God jerry pls dont! 😂😂
More accessibility notes: Apple Vision Pro is not usable for people with a lot of eye conditions— unlike other headsets. Besides the fact that corrective lens inserts are not available for people with diplopia, the choice to go with eye tracking for cursor selection causes unique problems for the Apple Vision Pro.  If you have amblyopia, (at least) one of your eyes doesn't have a full range of motion. If you have nystagmus, your eyes involuntarily move sometimes. If you have problems with central vision (e.g., macular degeneration, cone dystrophy, diabetic retinopathy), you may have to rely primarily or entirely on your peripheral vision— so where your pupil is pointing is never what you're actually looking at.  These are all likely to present serious problems for the kind of input Vision Pro is designed for, and I would assume that at this stage any of them could be showstoppers. Maybe Apple can compensate for some of them in software, but support for alternative pointing methods would be a great, flexible tool for visually impaired people of many kinds!
It’s really hard to justify spending 3500 on something that tears down like that. I’m sure the tech is awesome and future proof.
Cuando desmontaba cosas también me sobraban piezas 😅
I love these videos. But every time he scratches metal with the razor bothers me and gives me goosebumps.
I’m calling child protective services.
I expected better quality on the front glass for $3500.
$3500 and it's plastic!
2:58 ouch
You wear glasses for a decade? You don't need them now?
What they did with the battery didn't surprise me at all,  how savage 😂
I’m interested in what this could mean for the future of VR headsets. If people are willing to pay $3,500 for this, imagine what other companies could produce at that price point
the last moment is the important part,in this video. love you jerry❤️
this was painful to watch
imagine you scratching concrete wall with nails 😂😂😂😂  same feeling watching this 😂😂😂😂
What a nice video, it really made my day ❤
Why couldn't Apple have their version of Google Daydream VR?
I was so scared that Zach was gonna break vision pro into 2  like doing stress test for phones....
Of course it's plastic. They will use current version gorilla Glass in version 3. Version 2 will be gorilla Glass 1.
The side bars that serve as housing for the speakers are also removable with the 'sim card tool', there are small holes near their bases, which I found extraordinary considering it's Apple, this level of repairability is very unusual.
Wow This is what I called   TEARING DOWN  Bravo jerry
Why don't you destroy meta stuff you must be an apple heater
this is hurting me
As an Android strong fan, I found this video extremely relaxing and satisfying 🧘🏻‍♂️🙏🏻
UNA MONEDA O LAS LLAVES pueden rayar esos lentes que MIEDO!!! jajajja, 799 dlls para los que NO compraron apple care ES LO que pagaran por repararlo.
Zack is inspiring me also to rip stuff apart.
Apple: We never came up with fingerprint sensor cause it's too advanced for us in 2012. And comes with this banger like they're in 2050. This will be the best thing apple has ever come up in ages since iPhone 5s.
Here comes Anker, pushing everything off the screen😂😂
I was doing something on my phone with the video in the background I look back and the band is on fire this is an experience
Well done agent 47!
Normal people uses plaster if they hurt their fingers..  But Jerry.. Jerry is build different.  Go on watch the video.. i don't want to spoil anything.
Scheduled text message is one of the few things that keeps this guy from using apple lol, who uses text messages anymore
man must be nice to just throw 3500 in the trash. Maybe this video will make the money back for him. 537k views and counting as of now.
I'm a android guy but I'm really hoping this headset us the beginning of something big for apple as I'm a big fan of the vr medium
Bro destroyed my whole 1 year salary in a 13 minutes video
love from bangladesh ❤
seii❤
You can totally schedule a text message on iPhone. It requires shortcuts but it depends your use case whether or not that’s a benefit for you.
They sure do love proprietary cables
I fix it did well to show how to remove most things from this device
wow❤
Broh buy me one pls instead of destroying it 😰
Apple must be really pissed about this man😂😂
Ifixits teardowns may be more informative.. but Zack's are definitely more enjoyable
iPhone has scheduled texts!
JerryScratchEverything. Slow down with the box cutter man. You've made your point
this was hard to watch.
Is that working after that tear down??
"Don't worry, Jerry" lmao
now put it back together
I could'nt watch it all. kills me to waste a good unit.
Vision Pro's screen each has 11.5 million pixels, 23 million pixels is the total of both sides. Those 2 panel screens are sony ECX344A custom for Apple :v
This is a theoretical demonstration how people break me up🥲
❤❤❤❤
.... tears of loneliness ....
The video every techie was waiting for
Apple is one of the most engineered stuff. That’s why I prefer iPhone over Android phones. Fortunately, Samsung is good, though.
Prob the first apple product I have had some interest in but not at that price.
Единственный человек который показывает как нужно обращаться с продукцией эпл
Special place in heaven exists for people like you, Zach! Stunning video, and as I Apple user, I thank you for the 2 in 1 video today. Not that I felt the urge to drop $3500 on a Vision…
Me casually watching Zach absolutely destroying something I cannot afford: Hm well that's interesting.
The very last moment of the video was funny 😅
Please open the battery. There has to be something else there for it to be so big.
Knitted With The Love Of A Thousand Grandmas is my next band name!
And people go full banboy defending this overpriced VR headset. Plastic lenses? On a $3500 device no less? Apple taxing the hell out of the rich and the gullible on this one.
you should get apple care and try to get this replaced after you're done with it
Bruhhhhhhhh this should've been $500 USD 😂😂😂😂
Man, this is the dirtiest teardown I can remember you did. All I'm dreaming is about owning a Vision Pro, and I see this 😂😂
I wonder how long those fans will last and what will happen if even one dies. I bet they charge $400 to fix the fans.
They chose plastic over glass so every month they will have customer needing repairs. :D
12:06 LMAO, Made In China. Americans.
*Tears $3500 worth of plastic apart*  Me: I could live for 3 months on that, as one of the more fortunate.
Doubt you actually care but scheduled messages can be setup via the programmable shortcuts app
On the first look i knew its plastic and i was so cringed when everyone treated it likeit was glass imean itlooked so scuffy fora glass
catastrophic destruction of 3500$   brilliant 😂
If I were a piece of tech I’d be terrified and hope Zac would never buy me !!!
This will hurt
But they can't fit an headphone jack inside an iPhone 😢
Speaking of accessibility, I have a nostagnis that causes my eyes to move almost constantly. I wonder if I could even use headsets like this. I would be super interested to hear if anyone knows how these sorts of eye conditions affect eye tracking.
I was waiting for "Scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at 7" since MKBHD's video came out
Hearing JerryRig say, "It feels like it's been knitted by the love of a thousand grandmas" with his deep, soft voice made me chuckle and miss my lola at the same time.
All us poor people are shuttering with every scratch and tear
Apple Vision Pro got violated
Jerry, if this is being given away, i would love to have it as is. by 6:20 i almost cried. No one else does this... and it's fascinating ! thank you.
Moisture, makeup, sweat and tears of loneliness.
Yes, tears of loneliness. I agree 👍
I’d buy one if it was $999, but it’s like nearly $3500 all in which is too much for a plastic VR headset. Not even about affordability here, this thing is not worth the cost outlay given battery life and general durability
I hope you have apple care 😂
I died inside after i saw this expensive video 😭
Watching him destroy stuff I can't buy at 3am makes me feel insane.
Insane
Some people just want to watch the world burn 😂
Jeez Jerry! Why you gotta go stirring stuff up all the time? 😅 On a more serious not though, I've seen reviews marvelling at the moulded 'glass' front and did wonder myself. Makes much more sense that it's plastic after all and some good ol' false advertising. More concerning is the plastic inner lenses, especially since attaching/detatching prescription lenses may cause severe wear and tear damage over and above what cleaning with anything apart from a microfibre cloth would do. Very unnecessary corner-cutting there.
3500 gets you plastic lenses?
I bet this is going to be flop product
I'm glad Apple invented this 10:03 :  Predecessors Tabula scalata Main article: Tabula scalata Corrugated images that change when viewed from different angles predate the development of lenticular printing. A few examples from the paleolithic era exist in French caves.[2][3] Tabula scalata or "turning pictures" were popular in England since the 16th century.[4] Extant double paintings, with two distinct images on a corrugated panel, are known from the 17th century.[5][6]  H.C.J. Deeks used a similar technique with minute vertical corrugations pressed into photographic paper and then exposed to two different images from two different angles.[7] Under a 1906 patent H.C.J. Deeks & Co marketed a Puzzle Post Card or Photochange Post Card. In 1907 a Colorchange Post Card followed, featuring identical pictures on each side of the corrugations that were sprayed with different "liquid pigment or coloring matter" on (parts of) each side.[8]  Barrier grid autostereograms and animation Main article: Barrier grid animation and stereography  Berthier's diagram: A-B=glass plate, with a-b=opaque lines, P=Picture, O=Eyes, c-n=blocked and allowed views (Le Cosmos 05–1896) The oldest known publication about using a line sheet as a parallax barrier to produce an autostereogram is found in an article by Auguste Berthier in the French scientific magazine "Le Cosmos" of May 1896.[9] Berthier's idea was hardly noticed, but American inventor Frederic Eugene Ives had more success with his similar parallax stereogram since 1901. He also patented the technique for a "Changeable sign, picture, &c." in 1903, which showed different pictures from different angles (instead of one stereoscopic image from the right angle and distance). Léon Gaumont introduced Ives' pictures in France and encouraged Eugène Estanave to work on the technique. Estanave patented a barrier grid technique for animated autostereograms. Animated portrait photographs with line sheets were marketed for a while, mostly in the 1910s and 1920s. In the US "Magic Moving Picture" postcards with simple 3 phase animation or changing pictures were marketed after 1906. Maurice Bonnett improved barrier grid autostereography in the 1930s with his relièphographie technique and scanning cameras.  On 11 April 1898 John Jacobson filed an application for US patent No. 624,043 (granted 2 May 1899) for a Stereograph of an interlaced stereoscopic picture and "a transparent mount for said picture having a corrugated or channeled surface".[10] The corrugated lines or channels were not yet really lenticular, but this is the first known autostereogram that used a corrugated transparent surface rather than the opaque lines of most barrier grid stereograms.
This hurts
Wear apple vision pro and get blind
For this much money they could have asked Corning to develop some sort of scratch resistant glass exclusive for the vision pro instead of going ahead with this laminar glass as no one wants to see a device this expensive getting scratched up.
I really liked this video. Thank you!
You monster
The best first look Vision Pro video so far!
Me dolió el cuerpo de ver cómo destruye esas gafas t an caras ,que jamás podría comprar l as,,,3500usd destruido s
Jerry rigged the AVPro heartlessly 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
05:45 "tears of loneliness" How do you come up with these phrases? My god I lost it there 🤣
If you can’t buy it, just watch it getting destroyed. You will feel better…..   Natural human nature😂
Hope u enjoyed that teardown...😅😅😅
Is it possible to remove  the R1 chip and the M1 chip from the apple vision pro🙂🙂?
Expensive ASMR
I can't believe how easy can scratch the glass, I would be very upset if I could buy them.
U basically did not do well with this one… u should have watch first IFIXIT… They did the disassembly well
wow Gerry, you are brutal!🥸
Watching this from a 3rd world country
I just watched a month of work for me go to shit in 13 minutes and 29 seconds
That was insane to destroy the most expensive
'No way bro did this' was my reaction when j saw this video....
Wonderful😅
Man, did you hurt your thumb ripping some of the stuff off? Ouch!
I expected teardown of the charger as well... really disappointed. 🥺🥺
I made it before 1mil
Zack turns a $3500 VR to a $3500 sleeping eye cover
Vision Pro Who???😏
It’ll be Fail regardless…. World isn’t ready for it.  is rushing it…
Bro I thought that it was just like a pair of holographic glasses that looks like a very headset
Sins bro reaps everything
Apple wants their users to scratch the lense so they sell them a new one.
The fact that they still have to print the Apple logo on a processor inside a unit that only they create and sell and is impossible to open without destroying it... is mindboggling.
BRANCH OUT, DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT? BROTHER ZACK HERE KNOWS THAT APPLE WAS GOING TO DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY WITH THIS, WE ALL KNEW SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN PLANNING AND BUILDING THIS THING SINCE 5 YEARS OR MORE.
This the video we all were waiting for 😊
Gotta love the $10 Casio F91W. Nice touch :)
Plastic is plastic, and plastic will cost you $800 to repair.
Oh my god..nooo.......
Aaa... My heart...😣
😢😢😢😢😢
Finally!!!!!
Thank you for doing this and I'm not a huge fan of Apple and am Android user.
this hurts to watch
For  sale apple vision pro very little use, best offer but i know what i got 😅
1:19 lmao
crazy how much plastic is on that thing. The meta quest 3 has plastic lenses too but its not $3500. I think using has to do with weight
the wistlendiesel of tech
3000 fucking dollars for plastic 😂
😄😄😄😄wonderful Teardown,  very satisfying.  By the way, is this the same quality of Aluminum, as used in iPhone or better?
I wonder how much money to put into making their things needlessly complicated and innaccessable for anyone else to fix.
Man, I don't even like Apple products and still, after all these years, I can't not cringe right out of my chair watching you destroy ...er, test things.
Apple: We have to make it impossible to open Jerry: Challenge accepted
1000 Chinese grandmas from where these were made?
😮 wait I don't get it like!  If the world is digitally projected in vision pro then why are they making customise  Zeiss prescription lens!?
Did you know you can do a schedule text message with Siri Shortcut on an iPhone too? 8:05
Tears of loneliness and BUYERS REMORSE.
even men watch this and be like “hell no”
Something like the movie "Ready Player One" bla bla Apple
Samsung and LG have launched curved and transparent screens, It would be much better if Apple had used it.
Jerry can i get your Samsung Z Flip 5 please
did you get a warranty 💀
Slept off but i immediately got on here to check the video
plastic? I thought it's glass
This one was hard to watch..
Diehard Android Fanboy, that’s really sad Zack
i cried
Some grown men are crying while watching this video
A great tax write off for your youtube business! 3500 is very expensive but so is anything Apple..  Will I buy one someone may ask and that answer is no. Not for many yr once it is through the early adoption phase and has alot more to offer then I'll think about it. I'm content with my phone and tv and if I'm really feeling it I pull out my window laptop time to time. Good video Jerry.
The cutter is cutting the vision pro or me ?
Dude you’re just as bad as apple.. you market your brand and you’re sponsors as much as they do.. just saying
Yikes 😮 that was hard to watch him tear , scratch and burn that vision pro!😮
Black thermal paste ??
Loved all the ready player one & two references
As a die hard quest user this brings me so much joy
Hey man! Met you as you were taking a selfie at LV convention center prior to CES. Just wanted to say you are absolutely the chillest, nicest person who happens to have an incredible following I’ve met.
"digital recreation of the world".... Very distopian
Its a pure murder😂
RigEverything
boy do i remember the days of replacing your iphone 6 screen by yourself, seems they've put a stop to that a while ago
Thanks for the sheer torture as usual!
😅o ma ma
Bro just rigged the most expensive piece of tech out there. Respect
What happened when Jerry forgot to press the record button?
how does he put it back together?
Its still too big. We need Bigscreen Beyond sized stuff.
am not comfortable to watch this😰
the amount of tech crammed into this thing, i see why it's $3500..
I really have doubts that what do you do with electronic waste.. if observed my question please answer rig !!
“Satisfaction Pro” button❤
oh no not plastic... wayy weaker than glass
Any one else notice Jerry wearing a classic Casio watch. Throw back haha
No the sponsor for only apple products
Does this hurt the Apple goggles?
its made of plastic? lol....thats kind of funny.
Plasteec machine
Apple Visoin Pro is kinda a let down I agree but at 4:19 its like nails on a chalk board
RIP $3500!
Was like watching someone manipulate an Apple Products Voodoo Doll.
Was waiting for this but am sad about it 😂
How advance do you think technology will get in the future?
Why you are hurting me Sir?😂
Is anyone watching this on their Vision Pro ?
1 fall is all it takes falling in love with me
Zach should do a video 'getting my first manicure"
You should really send out the busted apple vision pro to me it would be pretty cool to have 🙂
Finally someone mentioning that the mAh is not comparable with phones, because of the different voltage.
ANOTHER BANGER
I hate the scratching sound 😅
i cringed every time he scratch the headset
lol i saw someone comment on the s24 video about this having scratches at level 8
Only a hardcore android fan can be this ruthless 😈
The way you use a knife scares me.
Does it still work?
Divljak
It’s not teardow it’s tear down from me
Why even bother with glass on the front if they're going to cover it with that much plastic??
always satisfied seeing the destruction of a worthless product. thanks again!
Watching him destroy
ok he disrespected the love of 1000 grandma....
😭😭not the vision pro
Who wants to see the durability test of that Casio f91w Jerry is wearing?
Ohhhh!!! My Vision!!!!😱
3500 means nothing compared to his 100k EV hummer.
Watching you destroy this $3500 device is like nails on a chalkboard 😬
$1000 full Valve Index setup with controllers, base stations, and headset ~$1800 pre-built PC with AMD CPU and GPU ~$200 accessories and spare parts hundreds of VR compatible games  OR $3500 Apple snow goggles no games, only social media retina biometrics
I bet this guy burnt ants with a magnifying glass as a kid
This is very painful to watch.
The Most delicate APPLE VISION PRO teardown video on the planet...😂😂😂
Apple: "premium products"  Apple users: arrogant, haughty, "don't buy it if you can afford it"  Reality: cheap plastic
I just hope it's a 256g version...
the M1/M2 chips have such an efficiency gain from consolidating so much functionality onto a single die. this performance is critical to embedded computing like a portable headset. normally memory interop calls are 50-10000x slower depending on how far away the memory is.
I was so awestruck with his destruction of this product, I have no idea what he said in the entire video.
Vettipolikk anna
Well thats not going to be easy to put back together and work!!!
Nobody wants VR
I already know someone broke it just looking at it
This video hurt my wallet, and it’s not even my money!
🐐!
I hate this thing. With the fiery passion of a thousand suns I hate it.
This made me feel ill
People in china are selling their kidneys for apple products. Well, I guess income from youtube must be good enough to justify destruction of a brand new product costing a few thousands dollar...
😳😵‍💫
So you're telling me I can't put this in my pocket with my keys 🤨
Like if you want a teardown video of the battery too. 😊  Something tells me that it isn't all battery on the inside for how big it is.
I'm not an apple fan but watching this guy destroy brand new product kinda grinds my gears. What a psycho. Can you do a review on the new Porsche 911 GT3?
Nice job destroying possibly the ugliest piece of tech I have ever laid eyes on. Normally I don't have issues with Apple products (just not for me) but this has always been ridiculous in my book since it was announced.
Accessibility features? How about also just making it accessible in general by making it more affordable XD
This SOG will be dinged up on week two of normal use!
imagine what if apple build a car
noooo dont destroy this give it to meeeeeee
Scratches at level 2 and level 3? That's pretty pathetic, to be honest.  Maybe that kind of explains it. Next, Apple releases a video showing how they made their new Curve Ceramic Shield, and then shocks everyone by saying it's $5999.
Omg watching him scartch the lenses make me cringe so much, I knew it was coming; but oh boy I was not prepared
I can't watch this guy destroy electronics it kills me inside. 😢
Shock and horror, an apple product you can't repair.
$ 3500  eyething  'Tested' beyond repair in 13.29 .  Very nice!
Imagine what it would take to go from this to a sunglasses-like device! The tech gap is big.
$3500 lol a complete gaming PC setup with Valve Index or this lol?
What I want to know is if it can’t work with someone who has a nystagmus
Does laminated paper have lamination between the paper? 😂
The best😊
and the changer still uses the lighting cable.
it is still a flop.
0:42 Agent 47 dreaming
Can't believe it's designed so well and look gorgeous even when ripped apart ❤
On one hand this is quite the piece of technology, on the other, go touch grass.  I have zero desire to own one of these, ever, in my lifetime.
super me gusto demasiado
Tears of loneliness 😅! Ouch! 5:47. Great video Jerry. The inside of the Apple vision pro looks dope. Thankfully I won't be buying one anytime soon. I'll wait for Apple to bring it out of the beta tester stage and make it avaliable to the masses for less than 1K.
My bank account could NEVER.
only apple can really under do and overprice this in a world where meta quest exists
Whopping $3500.  Next video is about how long it takes to get your money back???
I really don't get why that outside screen even exists. Why would you want people to see your eyes on a screen in front of your eyes. That's so dumb it sounds like a joke. It's just a waste of processor power, battery draw and makes the whole thing bigger for no reason. In fact if it wasn't there you could probably fit something else inside.. like a battery? Instead of it having to dangle from a cable like it's on life support.  It's impressive technology, but it's been turned into a gimmick that only Apple fashion nerds would buy.
considering the cost, this has to be the most vicious teardown in the history of electronic devices 😨
Would you care to donate this headset to me?
I loved that level 9 pick it was sooo great
That last but with the tattered vision pro was hilarious 😂
I wonder what happened to his thumb at 6:24 😂
Tim cook is sweating 😂
They still look like Zoolander go-go goggles. Apple must have paid you a lot to say you liked these.
oh god plainrock will have a field day with this
Can I have it when youre done?
Easy to say it's great when you can afford thousands of them
Hey Jerry what did you do today? Burn 3500$ dollars...
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🖤,,,iam watching your videos last 4 years ❤️
Feeling broke with every scratch & burn
Feeling broke with every scratch & burn
a cringe worthy apple fan watch experience 😊😊😊
watching this makes me hurt on the inside
I think repairability WAS given a lot of thought - they gave a lot of thought into how to not make it repairable 🙃
the laminated glass is so stupid
Looks like it’s turned into a used condition😄
Having a plastic front makes it cheaper to replace, so there's that for longevity.
Also I’m glad somebody finally mentioned anker all I keep hearing     YouTubers mention is ugreen this ugreen that and it seemed everyone just completely forgot about anker and how good they are
I was shock 😲 3500$ smashed 😅
the best thing about the apple vision pro is that we got a jerry video
Boy I can't see this.... it's too much..
Really satisfying to watch
I’m really confused as to why they even bothered with the glass plastic fusion. If the outside layer is going to be scratched anyway, just keep the whole thing plastic and lower the price.
zach be like "No scheduled messages? Here i come Vision Pro"
Using plastic front "glass" and lens on a $3500 product!! But then it's apple.
Just wanted to say, "Thanks Jerry!"
Have you ever tried an Oculus quest 3 or anything similar to it?
8.4 million views at the time of my viewing!😂 Video has been up for only 3 hours ⚡️
literally figuratively and economically 😂😂😂
I will be the first to say it, the twist to lock power cable looks very similar to the Samsung gadget case twist to lock.
Honestly this just confirms my suspicion that the next version absolutely needs to eliminate that front screen and get rid of the glass. They could probably cut $1,000 off the price tag with that alone.
Ъ.
Thank for showing the Thing is NOT WORTH $3500. it's just a fancy stupid computer just like the eye phoneys. You Svaed me $4k.
All this destruction, kids in Africa could have ate that.
People probably fooled by the video title lol. The Vision Pro probably has the best quality compared to others, and plastic is great for weight saving too, so some parts you gotta be careful.
After watching this, I don’t wanna buy this gadget now…..
🥹🥹🥹🥹
from a durability test to a teardown 😢😢
the samsung gear vr crawled so the apple vision pro could run
I saw. I clicked. I cringed. I liked.
Haha
I simply came to watch you destroy this Apple product, was not disappointed.
So costly but distroyed 🥺
that's gore
wow that looks like some real complex stuff
Apple care definitely cares about your ex dollars well being in their pocket.   Great break down video.
"Oasis" was that a reference to "Ready Player One" ?
Jesos
'Knitted by a thousand grandma's'. Pretty sure that's the modern EQ of 'a nice pair of wool socks' circa WWII; but updated. Great review!
Lack of glass is a huge fail at this price point.
I’m crying
Some of the best pieces of hardware technology.
Ready player M1
But it was so young don't you have any compassion Zack?  Zack: I lost that 300 phones ago.
Now put it back together
Jerry shows no mercy lol
Mannnnn! Waiting for you
Bro why u testing vr headset? What are u expecting
The most satisfying pain on youtube
I understand why Zack does this, I don’t feel much watching Zack tear up a $1,000 phone, but watching him ruin a $3,000+ device was probably the hardest thing I’ve had to do all day. I’m not sure how I feel about this 😳
Don’t worry guys! Even though it’s plastic, it’ll make the Apple sToNk MOOOOON!! 🤩🤩📈📈
Please Make video in Hindi language
This was painful…
Love that you're already thinking about accessibility! I have autoimmune neuropathy and I will eventually lose the ability to finely control my hands so that kind of thing will be a big deal for me.
There should be a full head helmet. I want to wear a hard hat model for work.
Not a huge apple fanboy like I use to be. But his still hurts to watch lmao
If Steve Jobs was alive, I always wonder, would he approve this?
Although I am not a fan of Apple products, I must admit that their technology is quite impressive and aesthetically pleasing.
At least it’s not made of glass
As an Apple fanboy I’m very disappointed with how they made the version pro a product I probably wouldn’t buy even if I had the nearly 4 grand that it cost . However if if it manages not to flop and fail and they make a 2nd version that’s better and and or cheaper Ill probably get it then
painful to watch and hear
You said you rock android,  why did you whip out an iphone at the end...huh !??
Me being low income and seeing a man burn 5k in front of me for entertainment
Meanwhile Tim Cook and Apple Vision Pro design team who had decided to launch the Vision Plus, Vision Pro Max and Vision Mini to their sheep club, after watching this vid be like😭🥵😡😡
I won't lie, it was a bit painful watching you destroy something that is so expensive.
The next big sh!t
The external battery pack only lasting two hours is abysmal.
It hurts to watch 🥹
Unattainable device so cringe to watch being destroyed :(
I got tears in my eyes
I really wish to have Apple Vision Pro. But I don't have that much budget? Can you give me a Vision Pro?
Is this covered by apple care ?
I’ve said it before,this is a waste of 3500 bucks😂 After your review, brother, this is a hunk of junk😅
Wow, thanks for that tear down
Be gentle please 🥽
it's not a computer until it gets microsoft word😊
though it is impressive but it always harmful for your eyes.😢
That’s pretty disappointing, if not shocking. I wasn’t going to buy it anyway because even though the software experience and degree of immersion may be way superior to the Quest 3, it’s still a VR headset and I’m willing to sacrifice some of that in favor of a more tolerable price. Even spending over 800 euros in total so far (512GB version, more comfortable head strap, case) was hard enough to justify to my partner.  Anyway, I would appreciate in the future if there’s going to be a headset that combines some aspects of both headsets. I think the fabric on the inside of the Vision Pro looks much nicer than the rubber of the Quest 3. Being able to change the distance of the lenses is a MUST. Being able to wear glasses underneath the headset should be possible, especially because Apple doesn’t offer anything for astigmatism yet. Now if the technology will make more progress and the quality of passthrough of the Vision Pro becomes standard, which is hopefully going to happen, that would be highly desired, too.  Absolutely inexcusable is the choice of material on the outside of the Vision Pro, especially considering that you’re charged that much money for replacement. Well, if I could create a headset myself, it would have the metal frame of the Vision Pro with the Digital Crown, made with actual glass, but rather the oval shape of the Quest 3 then this diving goggles shape. I absolutely love the design of the woven head strap but considering the weight of the thing, I’d prefer an additional piece across the skull just like the Quest‘s elite strap. The design of Apple‘s secondary strap is just ugly.  Oh and of course it should be 1000 maximum and more gaming focused and at least as powerful as current gen consoles. I wouldn’t mind having a battery attached to it, better than being attached to a PC or console. I’d even like the battery pack to be big enough for 3 or 4 hours in a single session. More isn’t necessary because it is tiring regardless of how good it is.
Watching the scratch test and chiseling at the shell of the S24 Ultra made me wince and cringe.  *Watching the same done to Apple products makes me clap and cheer.*
Uhmmm, idk if that headband adheres to the EU regulations on flammable wearables.
ZACH!! You can remove the rubber sides with a needle (there’s a little hole similar to the battery) and shows the mother of all LIGHTNING cables!!! It’s hilarious 😂😂😂 check it out
All I can say is "Jerry rigs everything". 😂
girth
ooouuchh! hahaha
"the first generation of something really special", lol, it's a fashion brand vr headset, calm down. why even use glass if you're not going to take advantage of the properties of glass? because the incoherent contrarianism of fashion brand
Where is that guy who commented "I want to hear 'it scratchs at level 6 with deeper grooves at lvl 7'" under mkbhd's video?
That was painful but necessary
Words on the street says the replacement for the laminated glass is that expensive because it's also hardware locked. If you try to replace the laminated glass by yourself the screen will show a message that will only disappear when you bring your device to an Apple repair shop.
Taiwanese will be the most affected people by watching this video 😅. RIP Microchip
Zack, what's with the chapter names 😭😭
$3800 ,, GOD DAMNN 😅
Having plastic lenses and front glass on a $3500 headset is INSANE. Wild.
I’ll never be able to buy that. So watching him destroy it makes me unbelievably happy
first add aluminium and then in next gen, add titanium..
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
In the name of science 😭
Poverty slap me twice
You need to moisturize your hands.
Well, it is an Apple product- what did you expect? It's probably got electronics inside it that crap out after a certain amount of usage too, just like their laptops which they refuse to fix since it's designed to be that way- not a problem to them!  It is a neat product though- if it weren't an Apple product this thing would have potential, but it's an Apple product, their propriety kills any usefulness this thing may have had.
Dang Jerry. 😂
From here new era begin 😊
i was thinking about this yesterday. i thought it's not gonna happen.
Man you are like sub zero, ice-cold
I really am hoping this is a generation 1. I want to see how far this can go in the next several years
A inside out skin for the outer "glass" would be epic
That deserved a sub if I've ever seen one 👍
$500,000 🥲
We just have to wait a bit, and android will make a cheaper superior version of it
You just broke it like popcorn's!
What did you expect? Heavy stainless steel on our face?
Niceee
Iam terrified 😢😢 2:05
😂😂 I expected this video from you… love you man 😃
For people who have no arms or no function in their arms, apple could make the vision pro completely interactive with eyes, just by having it select whatever you looked at last and click on whatever is selected by looking at the click button at the bottom of the screen.
This was painful to watch
Nothing better then watching someone destroy a piece of tech ill never be able to afford and he doesn't even turn it on first.
this is the proper way to throw a $3,500 ! it's mind blowing 🤯
Most painful video on internet today
$3,500?  No way.  So not worth it.  I'll wait until the price is actually reasonable.  Say $1,000.
Skiing with these things must feel great
No no nooooooo 😥
atleast it aint android plastic… No scratches at level 2, just 3, 4+.
Can you teardown battery?
Apple is always not Jerry-friendly.
Okyyy ...I'm not going to buy that .....not good quality 👎👎😂😂😂😂
I don't think this is a revolutionary product from Apple in a decade, because Microsoft Hololens did that already, but as usual Apple did it perfectly.
PLASTIC LENSES?! That is unacceptable for the price
Bring it back to Apple and let them know it was damaged 😂😅
No. The wrist twitch won't work. If a lonely man watch video, it will keep pausing and unpausing.
Wow that is egregious, my first thought seeing the MKB review was wow that front screen looks so glossy and susceptible to fingerprints and scratches, how is it gonna look in a year etc. But finding out that it also scratches at a three.. this sounds a lot worse than the bent iPhone fiasco. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if apple didn’t base so much of their brand identity on being pretty but even for a $500 set this would be a big issue, 7x that couldn’t fix this?
That poor mostly useless VR peripheral...
wow there's no exception ❤
"Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas" Hahahaha
Ngl, i do appreciate you not being the typical iPhone YouTuber 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
You know quest 3 does the same thing right?
Aaaaah. I think that Apple Care don't cover this damage.
Dam so you can scratch just cleaning the thing a total waste of money
0:02 RIP vision pro 🫥
I thought your name is not jerry 😂
Watching a video can’t make you feel physical pai—
I indeed enjoyed this "tear down" so much that I just blink once. Hey Zack you have gave us "appetite for destruction" in an educational manner.
🍎 is 🗑
a teardown skin for that would be nice not gonna lie
Así descárga sú íra con las empresas, en vez de pedir el libro de quejas.  Trabaja como un dentista. 😅
When he pushed the apple vision pro and advertise the adaptor is insane 😂😂😂
Yeah we also know the chips are made of silicon.
I imaging this is about as “glass” as all of the folding phone screens. Just as delicate lol But in this I’d imagine weight is an absolutely huge factor in the screen material choices, so it’s a bit more understandable in this application
The love of a thousand grandma's. Love it. Lol
Are the Jerry rig knives made in USA?
How was the reassembly process, pretty easy or???
This was a little surreal. I’m watching you destroy a Vision Pro while watching this on my Vision Pro. 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂
And this actually costs 3500$?!!! I can say they barely spent 20$ building this weak product
To save on electrical tape always cut away from yourself
Too bad you didn't check a scratch test to the back 😊
I like you’re videos but it breaks my heart to see thousands of dollars of stuff I could never afford break lol
Ever Scratch Jerry was making, it felt like it was scratching my Heart 😢
My girlfriend wants to know if you destroyed all your toys as a kid 😂😂
4K USD for a bunch of plastic , foh 😂
THREE BODY PROBLEM REFERENCE AT THE END??
I just bought a couple of your razor knives. One for me, and one for my Dad. I got them today! I love them already! Better than other much more expensive knives. Also, your videos are incredibly entertaining and informative.
I will be surprised if 5 people buy this OVERPRICED crap..
Hate to say it but after seeing this teardown, this is finally an apple product that I think justifies the price. That's a whole lot of engineering.
A 1000 grandmas 😂😂😂😂😂
Like if you are from India 🇮🇳
A don't like Apple devices either!! Well done❤❤❤❤
I’ve got an appointment to go demo a Apple Vision Pro on Wednesday. I can’t wait to see what the hype is all about!!
The whole video feels like a really good ASMR
Oh my God that was awesome that truly made my day I laughed so hard to watching your video oh my god dude that was awesome ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I know he’s kind of just destroying something just because but in the world, the VR glasses will never touch a set of keys. I’ve owned the total of four sets, and even the three sets I still own. I keep in their charging base, but none of them ever went next to a piece ofmetal granted mine don’t have glass on the side like Apple does but again I know he’s just doing this just do it. People have to tell me.
Impressive how much the glass was able to flex. It must be pretty thin. You can see why it's pricey (even with taking Apple nonsense into account)
I don't know why, but I was excited too see you tear this apart
So painful
🙄🙄"Not gonna lie" I wish people would stop saying that.
This has to be one of the most painful vids of his I have ever watched, I physically cringed several times.
3:12 I know I have not paid anything Apple in last 10 years, but that torture made me cringe, its a 3.5k Zack, give it some love!!
still tapping 😂
Ohhh nooooo it has come
"tears of loneliness" LOL
Hey I have filling and just shattered 😅
Its a good first step for apple to the vr xr industry. Can't wait to see version two where they hopefully address everything
Ive never been as horrified as i am today by zach😂😂 absolute devastation😅
damn those hands are dirty...
Zacks annoying disdain for Apple without even a real look doesn’t impress me. He’s not a tech guy at all.
3500$ piece of plastic glass 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣 no no that's your money. To whomever bought it 😂
BROOOOOO WEAR SOME SAFETY GLOVES!!!
The lenticular display is such a waste of money considering people are hard to see. They could probably just ditch it for a low res display or no display at all.
If the anker 10,000 mah battery is 37 Wh, doesn't that mean it's performance would be nearly identical to the 35.9 Wh battery that comes with the apple vision pro?  Edit: I guess what you mean is that it doubles the runtime when plugged into the existing battery.  Which makes sense because there's no other way to do it right now? 😅
RIP to the kid watching, who spent blood sweat and tears assembling that for $2 a day.
If apple is truly caring of mother earth, that product's material should  be compositable and air friendly when burnt - not just recyclable.
This feels so wrong it makes me feel guilty just by watching 😅
I still think these goggle style wearables are going to be a flop no matter what the brand is. Neat? Fun even? Sure, at least for a bit But idk, maybe I’m just not part of the target audience but I honestly can’t for the life of me see anyone using anything like this on a day to day basis. Maybe for games, I will give it that. But for anything else? Idk I just can’t see the appeal
nice
Even 300€ would be overpriced for that.
Apple product cheating revealed with gentle voice😂😂😂😂😂
It's worth it for exchange YouTube views.
Thank you for destroying Apple's latest overpriced junk that no one asked for. How come no one told them Google made this already 20 years ago and it was a complete failure? Oh I love how Apple tells you about their eco-friendly build processes while simultaneously adding more unrecyclable trash to the planet than any other company in history. If they'd just make their quickly-obsolete gadgets and stfu about saving the planet I would respect them more. My car cost less than half the retail price of this snowboarding-mask-shaped tablet from 2011. And I don't think these wannabe-futuristic Macho Man Randy Savage sunglasses are going to drive me to work. I suppose I'd be more shocked if a company successfully sold bedazzled firewood for $3600 + tax for each log, but at least then you'd have something with intrinsic value for your money. In less than 5 years these are going to be the toys at the bottom of your kids' closets that they walk upon to reach the toys they actually play with.
"Tears of loneliness ". Hahah
Waa what 😮
Ripping of $3500 seems 😅🤣
Pretty good stuff
You'd make a good Lobot.
to be honest if it’s glass on iPhone it would be way more difficult to maintain as it breaks easily and it will be much heavier.
I've been using paper towel to clean my VR lenses for the past 10 years never had a problem
🤣😂😂😂😂
Why Zack Why? 😭😭😭🤧
Just listen to his *voice* 😌
Zach turning a $3500 machine into an eye mask is both hilarious and terrifying
Another awesome vid. Thanks
Ohhh god... I felt the pain....
5:48 "Tears of loneliness...." 😂😂
The fact they are 4 grand (after taxes). And they are just crappy plastic that you will have to spend s small fortune to stay usable... or keep in a pillow case and never use them.
So you’re saying apple can make a super mac mini the size of an altoids box?
Smoking "anything" 🤔
RIP - Apple Vision Pro
$3500 for plastic lenses and a plastic front cover 🤡🤡🤡
this reminds me of when folks would buy brand new iphones and break them outside for views. GENIUS
apple will not give a charger to protect the environment and sells a non repairable apple vision pro at 3500$....turns out it's all about money
This is not tear down this is Beat Down😂
This video hurts my bones and my wallet
That piece of plastic costs $100 to produce.  All the fools paying $3500 for it.
Сомнительное качество 😢
Man, Apple is going to have video to layer on top of our gps tracking.
hey zack you could have removed those speakers using a sim ejector tool there are little holes inside of it
I really believe this is gonna be the start of something cool in the future. Still won't get apple products. F apple but yea, appreciate the innovation.
Watching him destroy apple products, gives me goosebumps every time.
Im sure the ridiculous clickbait thumbnail works for your channel, increases views, and funds good things, but I wish it were not so. Hyperbole and outrage still sell in all forms of media, because they work. :/ The content is beautiful, Zach is very funny, and I can’t help feeling sad regardless.
Are you going to torture test the iCar when Apple releases it? That would be epic.
need a teardown skin for the vision pro cause it looks fire 11:30
about the accessibility feautures, there already are different input methods! i think there is a wrist input method just like you suggested!
The best ad for the vision pro! 😂
The end 13:19 had me dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why does this channel exist? It seems to be nothing more than pointless rage bait.
😂😂😂😂 finally
The love of a thousand grandmas. Hahahaha
Is it just me or Jerry sounds a little like a psychopath? lol
I mean, you are going to send it to apple care to replace it right? wonder how much does that cost
Bro watching this my and eyes and spine has frozen beyond the refrigerators limits......
Those scraping sounds gave me goosebumps and grit my teeth
I DON'T UNDERSTAND why you didn't do a scratch test on the lenses?!?!
i don't know if i should laugh or cry
That lens scratch paralized me **skull emoji**
You destroyed it 😢
6:41 is that a scratch or a deeper groove on his finger?
😢😢this is heartbreaking....
When they’re able to get the profile of this thing down to that of your average corrective lenses, I’ll be such a fan. Not a huge fan of the big ol goggle look
The Audacity to destroy a $3500 tech in name of testing durability 😂😂
Came to hear scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7😂😂 dut disappointed 😂
Damn he completely demolished that thing😭😭
I love your channel... but this pains me to watch. Really wanted one but out of my price range arrrgggh but knew you do your thing!
That’s why you are a GOAT
Jerry represents what happens when intrusive thoughts win!
Distruction of Vision Pro gave me mini heart attacks(nor literally). This is not for the faint hearted.
Most traumatizing video for an apple fan boy 😂
To be fair you went to the extreme with this.. anybody that is going to buy this would be taking care of this..if you did this to any product it will get destroyed
plastic for 3k usd!!!!
pain
Oasis i see the reference 👍
This channel makes me so uncomfortable
I think you may have voided the warranty.
“Knitted with the love of 1000 Grandma’s” is like an amazing line. Almost as badass as the Sentry burning with the power of 1,000,000 suns
As much as I hate Apple repeatability and their pricing, it is a cool tech, would love to see what’s other company answer to this. Additionally if the price able to go down to $500 it’s a must buy, but as long it’s above 1000 Apple can go back to the dark side
if you wanted to see the devil himself watch this video 😭
Tears of loneliness   Lol
What do you mean "800 dollars to replace the "glass" "?  This is just a cheap piece of recycled plastic you can replace for much cheaper.
That hurt to watch but I couldn’t stop watching. Great content as always!!
Whats the opposite of ASMR? This. This is.
A plastic screen cost more than some iPhones 💀
🙆🏾‍♂️
Seeing this person destroying expensive things is kind of satisfying
300K visualizations before 2 hours OMG!
Imagine he doing a surgery
As someone who is dying for one of these this hurt my soul
There is so much tech in here getting decimated. I love it!
Apple all the way 💯%
damn that's some impressive engineering.
9:20 GLASS IS GLASS
Damn dude, your crazy!
It was knitted by a thousand Chinese children.
The scratches on the lenticular display. That hurt to hear.
3500 🪴
Meh.
Everyone been waiting for you to get your hands on this and say deeper groves at level 6. 😂
My guy needs to be a narrator
Finally thought Jerry don't make this video since. you know.. Its expensive...😆
This basically proves that he earns more than enough to afford tearing down the headset to within an inch of its life, with only 2 hours of usage.... Or he's a masochist
The video I have been waiting for a very long time 😈
Seeing you destroy such a pointless Apple product is the best thing ever!
Completely ruined Vision Pro. Very cool!
The front being plastic really feels like a slap in the face to steve jobs insistinf the first iPhone be made with a glass front.
The rubber insulator that keeps the "tears of loneliness" out is amazing !
10:03 EarCandy
The phones I could handle but… this hurts😭😭😭
love to see people destroying apple products
The "double blink" control idea is genius .. and seems so obvious once you said it. I wonder if it's something they can update through software. I think it's a good feature for everyone, not just those with a disability.
O cara descaralhou 30 mil reais
This is better than some horror movie. 🤷🏿‍♂️
The look on Apple employees when Zach walks in for new products.
One of the best rip off job ever Jerry and good job 👍 🎉
Totally off topic, but I didn't know you manufactured wheelchairs. I would definitely consider buying one from you after watching your videos.
FINALLY
Bruhhhhhhhh Zach pinching at start made my mind go places 😂😂😂
Today i understand the meaning of that " You live someone's dream"
Anyone else blow on their phone when he lit it on fire to blow the smoke away?
Apple fansboy will come in the war zone in 5 min😂😂
Watching this hurts my soul
Those children have worked real hard for the solo knitband but definitely not done by grandmas though...
Dude Have some mercy , Tim cook probably watching 😂
Damage 💀 ☠️
"Tears of loneliless".
Why does it need to recreate the world in front of you? Why can't it just use cameras to display whats in front of you? Like an iphone camera.
12:12 you find it how to ditched cable no one show that everybody says its non removable cable
Hey, it would be awesome if you could also do a tear down of Meta Quest 3, to check just how different it is from the Vision Pro in terms of build quality, repairability, and overall tech.
Watching this hurts my soul.
This tear down was fun, but for a more civil teardown, check out ifixit's teardown.
Yet silly people decide to drive a car with that in their head. Thank you for breakdown, i was looking forward to this 😅
You should have definitely opened the battery pack so we could see how difficult it would be to replace with a larger one.
ive been waiting for this!!!
3500 dollars for plastic?😂 At least give us glass…
So they use plastic when they should use glass but use metal when they should use plastic? Dumb.
Even if i dont give three craps about this thing my nerves are completely shot watch this lol
damn, the front cameras covered by plastic is incredibly stupid for 3.5k.
Hahah tears of loneliness 😂 Xd you nailed it here zach😂
Clean up your desk jerry 😤
and there goes $3,500  😌😊
Educacional
Gotta be the most expensive teardown ever
Who says you can’t schedule texts on iPhone? Just set up an automation through the shortcuts app.
just launched it and saw the user experience on social media, on this channel it actually directly destroyed the thing, it was really exciting
This is the first video that has upset me simply due to the sheer price of this thing
Lol flammable material and plastic front.
Imagine putting any and I mean ANY plastic on a $4500 virtual reality headset. Pathetic.
A $3000 headset and wont even a level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7
Will it survive   hydrologic press? Microwave? Shower? Swimming pool 🤔
does anker make a multidevice charger for Samsung ecosystem? that would be lovely.
I'd love to have seen a teardown of the battery pack as well.  Seems very large & heavy as compared to it's capacity.
This videos is non ironicaly very Satisfactory to me
bald lol. bald funni 😬
7/10  I was here to see it get crushed by a hydraulic press.
I'm in pains
it's*
Most satisfying video ever for Apple haters.
There it is, finally inner peace~
Awesome messy disanbring😅
Imagine if this guy keyed your car
This is how serial killers start
His tone of voice makes this like a Gen Z Hannibal Lecter
Can we get some apple socks pro? You've got me wanting to feel that knit 😅
I love how he decimates it while simultaneously telling us to be very careful
😂😂definitely with all the luv from grandma.
I also wanted to see the speakers
Ngl at first it hurt to watch.. but then I started to enjoy it
God this was torture for my poor a*s🫣 i hope Apple gives you these things for free, thats the only way this wouldn't be a waste💵🔥
What are you did??
I'm using wired headphones that are taped together because they're about to cut off at the tip and seeing this makes me happy, thank you Jerry ❤
This is absolutely my favorite review channel. Others, especially agencies we see on TV.   Unbiased, not trying to up sell or down sell features, just an honest review. Let us see you take it apart while you tell us what's there. Just as willing to show the bad as you are to show the good. Not worrying about if the maker likes your review or not.  Letting us make up our own minds. Thank you for that.
What's the point of scheduled text messages? Why not just sent it right away?  I'd consider buying a good quality AR headset, but not from apple or facebook.
Casey Neistat’s video captured the moment of the future in his movie, could see where Apple’s going..!
Please stop working with Anker. They have proven they don’t respect their customers.
what scam of product, 3500$ and probably the ivnest in material are 300$ even less.
Best video ever
Xreal Glasses 👓 best ❤❤
Whyyyyyyyyy😢😢😢 just give it to me if u dont want it
It physically hurts me when I see him destroy a product that’s more than my rent 😢. Lol but still gonna watch it tho
Bro..💀
I wasn’t expecting this teardown.
Believe me when I say, I have been patiently waiting for this video
"Tears of loneliness" The best line in this teardown 5:46😅
unless you have some sort of mega-futuristic autofocusing laser, you need a 5-axis laser to remove the glass from the front
😢
I dig your breakdowns but I bet you trim your fingernails on a chalkboard! Haha! I want to mute but you’re saying important stuff…
if i was an apple engineer i think id cry watching this
Android sucks lmao
The ending 😅
😂😂😂 this is why jerry is the best
No batteries where harmed during this mutilation
Apple plastic is cheap
i love what you do, nobody would be willing to do anything like this but you, thank you.
Electrical tape band-aid.   Nice.
i dont like iPhone and Apple prices but this Apple Vision Pro makes me to buy, but there is one "little" problem, 3k + usd is my 7 month salary....
I don't want to come across a hater, I like Zach's other content and given Zach is an advocate for reducing e-waste to continually make these videos where he effectively destroys a piece of tech for no real reason other than getting views seems kind of played out. I know it's just a drop in the ocean and that Zach does a lot of other good stuff and puts the money he makes to good use on other projects, but it does seem kind of unnecessary at this point to continue making this style of video.
I can’t, I’m not man enough to keep watching 😭
I've owned almost every headset on the market, and this thing is wild. Hats off to the engineers at Apple; they did it again.
I heard Tim Cook had a heart attack after watching this video
This is a clickbait title, it is laminated glass, as mentioned on the website and in this video!. Apple puts the plastic part on the front to avoid it from shattering. They didn’t worry about the scratch resistance because these won’t fit in your pockets and this  isn’t a touchscreen display lol. You would have to go out of your to scratch this. Makes way more engineering sense to make it more shatter resistant since you are much more likely to have something bump into it than to have keys in your pocket scratch it. So no, Apple doesn’t have some “explaining” to do, like all engineering there are trade offs to every part. Apple simply picked the best trade offs that would yield the best results for the given use cases of the product…
Apple watching this to study on improvements😂
Time to clean the desk.
Wow so much for the claims on the glass, those bastards
A plastic coated glass makes no sense to me.
Ready Player One references 💪🏾
Was waiting for this one
Sorry, but these just remind me of Macho Man's sunglasses.
Nice scratch.
I've been waiting for this video lol
It’s too bad you just crap on some brands without a fair test clearly because you like their competitors more. I’m just going to start with the cyber truck get a 3 motor and then talk all the crap you want after because you’ve earned the right to. Been waiting for a bunker update those videos were great don’t miss understand this.
This hurts to watch
Tell me you aren’t building a human sized virtual reality haptic suit without telling me you’re building a human sized virtual reality haptic suit.
I'm dying to see Apple comment with a crying emoji here!
Something about his cadence when he says “feels like it has been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas” sends me 🤣
This is so satisfying.. ripping the vision pro like a child.. awesome video mate 👌
Who else had to mute the video when the razor started cutting into the headset?🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♀️🫨
Something about his cadence when he says “feels like it has been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas” sends me 🤣
my question is what if you have a bad lazy eye? lol
Cant wait for the inevitable chinese knock off
The video we’ve all been waiting for 😂😂😂
OMG! He did did it!
Man despite how overpriced this is (atleast imo), Im genuinely so damn hype about this, its such a well made and refined leap in vr/ar hardware. I hope whoever purchase this get full value out of it, and i sincerely hope that more companies and people start focusing on tech like this.
im not happy with him that he broke that apple vision pro and it cost almost $4,000 worth it and he should not break it at all and he need to test it and use it as what it look like and feel it and not to break it as void the warranty for that and thats why
Does it still work?
Am I crazy or is that headband extra flammable
I see you cut your thumb, the Vision Pro didn’t go down without a fight 😂
Bro razor blades can scratch anything.
I don’t understand why Apple advertises it as glass knowing Zack runs these tests.
We cant deny that its a truly work of engineering!
My guy just literally stands by his name and rigs everything even if they cost $3500 damn
It’s junk
I wish you had tested again with the all those scratches over the cameras to see what would happen with the sensors and the passthrough.
Finally ..thank you...scrartch that sh$t.  $3500 my a$$.
one day they will put a law against opening there products lol
R.I.P   3500$  😂😂
Remember that line from Fight Club about wanting to destroy something beautiful?
if only it was more like a sunglass it would have been a revolution .
Taking tear down to a whole new level! Well done to you. You win the internet for me today.
It should be made of what? Cast iron?
I feel the Vision Pro is what I wanted Google Glass to be
Each second of this video costs about $4.5.
The Vision Pro is the next smartphone.    Cyberpunk here we come.
This video gave me so much anxiety, as I look at my pristine Apple Vision Pro sitting on my desk.
Brother  What have you done 😂😂😂😂 Destroyed the vr headset like its very cheap product. 😂😂
This was so satisfying😂😂😂
If it is to be true, future shall yield the new!
first video viewed on this channel instant sub
What glass?
Star trooper helmet visor
You are amazing as always
Is it the most expensive thing you broke down?
Yesss let the level 7 consume you... DESTROY MORE MOORRREE
The fragility of the “glass” and lack of repairablity is disappointing.  The first maker of a “screen protector” is going to make money
While valve index has high repairability lol
This physically hurts to watch lmao omgg
Wow.. ripping open a $3500 piece is another level..
Tim Cook will not be happy about this.
4:17 *I am so sorry for headphone users.*
snd people say apple is better then android
Its how you meticulously and carefully expose the components that makes this so satisfying.   I mean, just screw it all back together and it's like it was never apart.  Great work.  p.s. can hear all the apple fanboys screaming from here lol  👍
This is like when they destroy perfectly good cars in movies. I'm always like "well if you're gonna just destroy it I'll take it"
Its hurting my belly lol
Credit where credit is due, this is a genuinely innovative and exciting piece of technology. Completely unaffordable to the average person, but when it comes to expensive luxury products this product seems to be more worth it given there really is nothing quite like it on the market.
En este canal torturan a los amantes de la tecnologia, sean precavidos.
Would be interested in how much EMF radiation is nuking your eyes and brain wearing this thing.
Now you know why this cost $3,500 dollars.
Stefan Salvatore❎ Zack Nelson✅ . IYKYK
if apple makes 1,000,000 of them, they should make 1,000,001 for you know who
We need a Ferrari review! ;)
This teardown hurted more than a general smartphone
7:36 china is on its way to copy this apple product 😂
destroyed in seconds
Estoy llorando! 😢😢😢
I’m glad it’s plastic. If it was metal it would be heavy.
04:18 made me scream
No way it costs Apple more than $1000 to make one of these
Zach found the Lightning Pro Max, but missed the Lightning Ultra 😂
What I love about this video is he has one of the most anticipated pieces of tech in his hands and his favorite part of it is the sock🤣
The entire time I was gritting my teeth from watching a $4k piece of tech be torn apart 😬😆
This plastic thing costs $3500? Worst, it can't play games
Jerry you tripping dude im an android user but even i know iphone has had scheduled text for a while now my girl just showed me 😂
Your videos are generally hard for me to watch.  This one.  Wow.  That was tough.
can I have the frame please>?
Can you give me one
Nye your android guy you cant enjoy or maximize that gadget.  Just wait for Samsung  to release like that.
👍👍😊
You are a tech surgeon!!
Man watching this video just made me depressed :(
That butchery is fun. PS: that band is HIGHLY flammable. I mean, kinda dangerous.
Watching this destroyed hurts me more than my grandmas death
The way he destroys everything he touches😂
I just want to see someone rich & dumb enough to buy this pair it with a Dyson Zone.
As someone who is currently recovering from wrist surgery to alleviate chronic wrist pain - no to a wrist bend for the interface! Accessibility is a must but that particular solution would make it inaccessible for me! Especially since I don't know yet if my surgery will work.
Must be great to waste $3500+!!!!
ok not worth it to buy
Wow
Made with love of 1000 grandmas 🥰  That’s how you make content for us. Thank you 🙏
Parents and grand parents always said to sit away from the TV because it’s bad for your eyes. Now we strap shit 1/4” from our eye balls. I’m sure it’s safe though
Most wanted video from jerry in history 🙏🙏
This hurt to watch... I want one of these so bad. As a bed bound patient in a skilled nursing facility this would significantly improve my quality of life. I had better start saving up 😂 Also very glad you brought up about the alternative inputs. I think they really missed an major accessability option that wouldnt cost in terms of hardware and would just require some code to make it happen. Perhaps in an update. 🤞
i love how he just casually explains shit while its actively on fire.
Quick, click the like buttom. Youtube got to pay for this vr headset.
4:18 😮that Scrat
What a mess :D good job Jerry!
I love your videos BUT GOD THE SOUND OF YOU SCRATCHING THE METAL HAUNTS MY DREAMS. Worst sound ever
World first durability test your
Wowsers, running your knife on the screen, gave me shivers. Who needs a chalkboard board
👁️👁️scraaaaaaaatcccccccchhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Google Glass 2.0. It's trash, who tf would wear that in public.
7:55 what I told her the first time being together 😂
Jerry Scratch Everything
My hairs were on edge with every scratch and bend..cool video
Last clip is awesome bro 😂
I couldn't watch this video. It felt like I was watching a faces of death Isis beheading video. So tough to watch!
It’s $2,369..
I've been waiting for this video
I hope we see a worthy competitor come forward soon! Although the fact it renders your environment entirely makes me slightly uneasy for a variety or reasons, so i'm curious to see if were able to do this as an overlay rather than a complete recreation, like a HoloLens.
Tempered glass,😂
bro literally fucke*  the apple vison 😂😂😂😂
"Not until they add the ability to send scheduled text messages" hahaha what a flex. I bet they announce they'll add this feature before year's end.
Im waiting for a facebook marketplace post saying like new...
Lonely and losers are their target market
You have to respect a guy who makes a living tearing expensive stuff apart.
its so expensive, cause they payd you to talk good about it hahahahahahaaha  what u will use it for more than 1 hour?
Glad you had a blast, but damn how level 9 just breaks the glass
9:20 you should've gave a viewer discretion warning. god damn did you make my whole body curl.
Electric tape Bandai
I come here as part of my ANXIETY MANAGEMENT THERAPY  Thanks Nelson
This was an epic review.
Yeah the most awaited
You rig everything 😅
9:02 glass costs more to replace than my ford focus windshield
Bro Zack doesn't give a flying F. He just rips through 😂😂😂😂
Waiting for a front screen protector that shows the insides
Thank you for destroying it
Still unsure if this video makes me happy or sad
Bro wasted 3.5k without shedding a tear. MAD RESPECT🫡
Has Zack done this for Quest 3?
Lens scratching made me gasp.
The same thing always happens when I see something cool from Apple. It is SO AMAZING! And then there is always something stupid to sour it for me like the stupid cable for the battery! It's like Frankenstein's monster! An UNHOLY amalgamation of a Type C and Lightning cable! I also believe that in no time there will be front cases to protect the front. If I'm not mistaken, even an opaque material would work fine, as long as the camera's are unobstructed. Only thing you would lose is the transparency gimmick. Edit: As for the stupid connector, people will work around it. I can see a market for upgraded batteries, or a quick swap kit.
No teardown skin for the front? :)
my soul left my body when i saw him scratch the lenses
I was actually impressed until shortly into the video he said the "laminated glass" easily scratches and costs a shit ton to replace even with Apple care. A reminder of why Apple is a dog shit company, they make stuff designed to fail then force you to spend a ton to fix it.  Probably the least consumer friendly company on earth, they know their customers have more money than brains.
Waiting for Zach to assemble this again to see if is still works! 😂
I can't even afford the damaged one 🥹
You have received my message😂😂🎉
Zac. What do you do with everything after a tear down? Trash or make a robot? 🤔
Most heart warming and broken at the same time
3500 down the drain 😭😓😓
tears of loneliness got me lol
Chilling to see this video seeing 4K+ worth of device destroyed mercilessly.
"knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas " that was very deep, I can't stop thinking about this phrase now
This actually made me nauseous. And his smooth voice as he’s committing tech device murder made me think of Anton Chigurh.
"oops I forgot to press record"
I think they got the price right to limit scalping
I was so nervous, watching him with that box cutter surprise he didn’t cut herself
*cry
I am absolutely certain Louis Rossman could fix them 🤭
Very insightful
This is the video we needed but not the one we deserve.
I have to say, a teardown skin on the front glas would look incredible
Very short gap between legendary scratches at level 7 and deeper groves at level 8 of S24 Ultra to this ultra high end first gen product that scratches at level 2.
No ones putting it in their pocket bro
как же больно и интересно смотреть за этим
Ha I tried to blow the fire out like a twat 😂
"Knit with love from thousand grandma!!" Lol
From the packaging box to the dust bin what a beast you are sir 💪😅😂😂
well we now know Apple Vision Pro is LONELY TEARS proof
and people say quest 3 is better hardware lmao
Sweat and tears of loneliness. Very true.
It hurts to watch
I Justine is still on youtube?😂
Best place for vision pro is in submarines and fighter jet planes
you should also peal the powerbank i like to know what is inside it
Your my favorite YouTuber now after watching your videos for a long time I never subscribed until now
Man scratches at level 3, when it is an 3500$ product? Fuck apple
It hurts watching $3500 being destroyed somehow
That glass front literally does nothing other than offer a shape and appearance Apple seemed to want. It adds weight and makes the screen harder to see and so on. Most pointless feature on an Apple product for a long time.
HOLY SHIT EXPOSED
This thing can be ripped apart by a 5 year old lol. Lock it up.
Absolutely no one: Manager, who sent Apple Vision to this blogger and waited usual influencer's tech review 😂😂😂
You missed speakers.. how they look like inside !!
Oh dear...
This is absolute madness. I love it.
13:29 13:29 13:29 13:29 😂😂
Seeing you use that razor blade gives me anxiety!
Meta quest 3 better
My guy dropped four grand to please us....(android people lol)
aa
Nooo… stop….
Good to See whats inside - But when I realize 3 Lacks still it hurts 😕.
Knitted by the hands of 100 children
😢😢😢 give it to me sir
You forgot to show the return of the lighting cable!!!
Crazy how much they are charging for this.
Jerry 😂😂😂😂
Wow.  You do all kinds of tests. Thanks!
oh no it begins
Such a poor design from a company the worth of all Europe and China! SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️
the crunchy plastic glass was so satisfying
Apple is garbage
$3500 for science 😁
6:41 did you cut yourself Zack?
Dumb product
I wanted to cry watching this 😢😅
Tears of loneliness 😭
I'd suvscribe, but knowing YouTube's algorithms Jerry would never be suggested again
It hurts🥲
Will never understand the hate Apple gets. If you don’t want an Apple product don’t buy one. Nobody is judging you.
This hurts me. I’m never gonna be able to afford one of these so it pains me a bit to see it destroyed.
Honestly who thought it would be entirely glass? That would make it way too heavy. Also there is a cover. I’m not even an Apple lover most of their new products are meh.
$3,500!? You can buy a brand new Honda Grom for that much.
The Freddy Krueger of Electronics . Let me get my Popcorn.
This seems like one of those videos that the AI overlords are going to be very upset over..
Sorry apple fans 3500$ is not worth noting to hype samsung made vr vision a decade ago and this tec exists since late 80 in fighter jets
W rizz
Oh they put that super flimsy plastic coated glass there for one and only reason...
No Teardown battery ?
8:05  Wtf? That's your problem with iPhone? Scheduled texting? I've never even thought about that once in my life lololol
When you cut to the band after talking about the best bit of construction.... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Great video BUT every rip and tear gave me the heebie-jeebies😅.
Whistlin diesel of the tech world .. gotta love YouTube 😂
For 3500 bucks, the top "plastic" must at least scratch at level 9 with deeper grooves at level 10.
Most satisfying video 🎉
Because that's what I think when I pay 3000 bucks for something. Plastic
3.5k buckaroos for an undurable both in integrity and battery longevity piece of plastic
They didn’t expect ppl to try to scratch a $3500 headset 💀
Ay no 😞😣
Subtly showing his angry and envy over MKBHD typical bald eagle😂
having watched way too much horror movies I see my liquefied eyeballs getting sucked out of my head and sliced by the fan the moment I put this on
I’m hurting 😢
And after the tear apart, um teardown, its still just as useful as it was brand new it just looks better now.
“Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas”…impressive!
I called this video on you insta Jerry!!! Love it
Lmao with the love of 1000 grandma's 😂😂
Lol
Oh gosh this was roughy to watch lol
Lol
Teardown skin when? It'd look better than the eyes on the front
2:59 tell that to any guy who buffs scratches out of car windows, headlights and tail lights
$4,000 smh 🤦🏾
hmmm half a year of food or a gadget that will break or can't be repaired.
wtf
Burned 20 grandma's worth of love 😅
Tears of loneliness.
This year is weird year. First scratches at lvl 7 deeper groves at 8 and now scratches at lvl 3 groves at 4 😮
"tears of loneliness"  hee hee
How do people still buy apple. The sheep in this world are so DUMP.
I can't use any headseat that isnt clear, gaving a camera feed a monitor on the inside is never the same as reality and i instantly feel sick. It sucks bc vr is a fun thing and ive played a few basic games but i pretty much have to sit down for the rest of the day after a short playtime
Bruhhh
Well yeah of course. Its gonna take 10 more years for apple to actually find out about good build materials
The wired battery part turns me off.. i may consider when a rechargeable version arrives.. maybe
I wasn't expecting a teardown video.
The whistlin-diesel of tech😂
6:21 Jerry couldn't find any screws so he goes for the bend test .... Classic 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude casually destroying a $3,500 piece of high-tech like he's opening up a stick of Juicy Fruit. Glad to see you wearing some thumb protection though to protect you from your knife. (BTW: Canada Customs approved knife!)
Tears of loneliness 😢
Why video ended so fast 😢
I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO looking forward to this video!
finally! the videos here! can't wait for the "scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7"! edit: turns out its scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4
Luckily he purchased apple care, he can easily send it back to Apple store for a new replacement 😂
PLASTIC
Me watching this on my Apple Vision Pro 👁👄👁
You can run an automation to send a text to a certain person at said time but you’ll have to delete it after the automation has been completed.
uh oh
Zack tapping his finger at the end after the butchery has me rolling lols 😂😂😂
any chance it blows when u r wearing?
11:32 yes.. Typical Jerry😂
Apple should hire this person 😅
it's hilarious that the Vison Pro was completely destroyed before he even removed the plastic from the battery lol
The scratching of the metal never gets easy to hear 🙉🙉
Now compare it to the Quest internals
They know what they did!
Samsung over here with the galaxy S24 Ultra: scratches at level 7, deeper grooves at level 8! meanwhile apple...
4k? no thanks
I may be an apple hater but sheeeesh my electronics ass cries
It was really hard for me to watch this video but I enjoyed it. 😅
@Jerryrigeverything There’s an anti dust layer on the glass and that’s what you’re seeing scratched. Reference the phone repair guru’s teardown.
Why tearing down this $3500 product makes me feel bad somehow, even tho I already know it's for tech and science? Or is it me being an Indian?
Lol he really tearing it down
Crazy I 4,000 for this and you just destroy it . Greta job
Blink accessibility options sounds like a great suggestion. Even for able bodied users.
Watching this hurt way more than I thought it would
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 no words 😂😂😂😅😂😅😅😅😅
This is worst than nails on chalkboard 😣
Was this covered by Apple Care? 😂

Apples Vision Pro engineers must get a heart attack watching this video 😁
You destroy Apple 😂
If apple releases sales figures and they're really good we can expect Google to release the Google pixel sight pro in the next 3 years and it'll just be a rebranded Google cardboard lol
NGL i love that apple made this Standard now imma call it samsung google and others are going to try their own shit too !
That’s a really sleek looking, slim profile headset! Sure hope there aren’t any FLAWS with it! 💀
Thank goodness for that $500(+$300) Apple Care amirite???
Apple always makes some of the nicest looking tech! You definitely pay a fortune for the engineering though.
this man just likes fire
every second is painful to watch, watched it any way :) :(
Man does anyone else get the vibe he’s done this to a human?
I think it should be called a "tear up" not a "teardown"
Hard to watch 😅 $$$$$
A2d soldiers 🔥
Oh it hurt every time he scratched the lenses 😣 as I am a meta quest 3 owner
i've never been much of an apple fan of anything after 2006, but i was almost sold on these until that scratch test... i probably wouldn't be buying one even if it didn't start scratching til level 6, but the tech does seem cool, just too bulky to want to be seen anywhere in public with them on, haha
Interesting but makes sense to use plastic on the outside as that doesn't impact anything but inside they should've used glass.
Atleast remove the side sticks, learn something from phone repair Guru.. u can screw it at the same time and tutorial!!
lenses  and screens are 10% all the other things 90% i think for now they should combine iphone as computer and only glasses as hardware it will be very cost effective just like xreal air glasses.
10:02 - 10:12 please never again. please.
Its Amazing Technology.
So i take it half the cost is for the incredible knitwork.
Ay lo que me dolio este video, q bajon ser pobre
I'm about 1:24 in, and this is the first video I've ever seen of yours. Gotta say, I love how calm and focused, yet nefarious sounding, your voice is. Psychotic! Love it. Gonna be reeling at the destruction here shortly 😭
This wasn’t the durability test video. Very sad 😔
Who all double tapped @10:04 ✋
Man, i just watched Phone Repair Guru tear down the AVP and he made a serious attempt to keep it working, and Zach over here just starts hacking at it with a utility knife. 😂
So.. When is the give away for this item? :)
You expect apple to make stuff that had a very over blown price point, but I wasn't expecting so much plastic on this thing. The not real glass on the eye piece lense is a shocker. For 3500 bucks, they could have afforded real glass. That's really shitty.
I DIDNT THINK HE WOULD ACTUALLY DO THIS 😭
Apple's gonna sue over this video
friend, why did you take this useless device for review?
Well you need that apple $20 Polishing Cloth to clean the screen :)
seeing him scratching that $3500 thing, i think i'm going to throw up 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
I’m not surprised considering it’s curved glass. It’s probably harder to make harder glass with harder curves…
This made me happy
You have a way of making expensive tech look cheap
Savagery at its finest.
Can't believe I just watched ¢43,212 destroyed in less than 15 mins 😳
iPhones don't have scheduled texts 😳😳😳  I couldn't live life tbh. It's not good to texts clients at 2am when you finally finished editing
Don't worry there's still time for it to be a flop cause a $3500 VR headset is ridiculous
Nothing to do with this video but you got a mention from a Minecraft player  Good times with scar
The apple headset digitally recreates the world around you, while your brain organically recreates what the headset sends to it 😊
Scratching the lenses made me sick more than anything else
Ya know, in hindsight, a massive slab of glass on what’s basically a stand alone headset sounds like a terrible idea. They’re already super heavy.  Edit: WAIT IT *IS* GLASS?! SO IT SCRATCHES AND IT’S ALSO HEAVY? WHY?!
Oh Jerry, I'm just thankful that you don't do sports-car teardown & durability tests!😅
I dare you to return it.
They had to have the glass scratch easy so they can remove the laminated layer on next year's model and market it as "The most scratch-resistant glass ever put on a Vision Pro"
that sure is a thick gloop of thermal paste
Bro destroyed it already
Dude you could have just gave it to me... This hurts💔
As a mechanical design engineer, these videos are pure Gold 🎉❤
What is the point of the glass on the front if it's not see through?
I bet the next version (apple vision) will use local cloud computing from a newer Mac or your iPhone or iPad to display video in a larger space
I love Nidec!
😂 Painful to watch but fun!
You’re so passive aggressive it’s annoying. Thinking an Apple product would flop is insane lmfao
JerryScratchesEverything
Finally you are arrived…😂😂
im disappointed you didn’t realize you could remove speakers…
The vision pro seems revoloutinary! So much tech in that small headset!
Yeah let’s make accessible for people without heads.
It was hard to watch yet intriguing to see Zach absolutely decimate this $3,600 dollar device from Apple, nice
If you buy this and wear them in public youre just asking to be robbed
This guy hates apple.
Well done Zack
Sorry $3500 glasses but it's just business
Plastic is a feature, it's lightweight. I wish all Apple learn it rather than adopting heavy glasses
There goes Jerry, turning my dream Apple Vision Pro into modern art. It's not just a bend test, it's an emotional rollercoaster. 🎢📲😭
Works great for VR 360º videos of your favorite attractions on Virtual Disney World!
Hilo!
Been waiting for this 😂
it hurts to watch this
you ducking a virtual screen isnt a indicator of how real it is. its an indicator that youre a boomer lmao
great it’s from plastic, it weighs less on your neck
This gotta be the first broken apple vision pro 😂
when he scratched the camera I was like NOOO !
I didn't think he was gonna do this!
Apple made another rubbish fancy things
Scratching a $3500 device? Yikes!
im kinda thinking about buying one of these but htat front glass.... man...   id also like to use a battery pack in a backpack to give me a days worth of battery
You can repair those scratches in 5 seconds with a candle
Hahaha, hier in Deutschland fliegen sie mit dem Preis
Poor Apple vision pro R.I.P.🙂
Aww...I wanted to see the front display show your eyes without the piece of glass. Miss opportunity :/
Faleceu primeiro Apple🎉vision
This is a perfect example of apples bs lol. Vr has existed for so long. They charge an absurd amount for a piece of plastic to be replaced because if they charged you the 20 bucks it would probably cost, then it would seem cheap. Can't do that lol
First time in VR? yeah its cool.
the guy in the mkbhd comments must be dissapointed with those "scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4"
3:31 yes it's S800 either way to replace the front window, but the second replacement with apple care is only $300, it also covers other breakages like damaged power conmectors/battery banks.   Apple care is a great deal if you expect multiple breakages
“Feels like it’s been netted with the love of a thousand grandmas” lol
I suppose you could buff the plastic lense  Wonder how much more it would have cost with some of that glass from the s24
As it can track your facial expressions. Why not make it so you can just raise your eyebrows or something to click/select. (I think blinking may not work as good because you need to look at what you select. Might work though, just a guess). Raising your eyebrows will make it less weird in public, as seen from CaseyNeistats video, and more accessible for those people that need it
Tears of loneliness 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Epic !!!!!
going viral for sure
After seeing the ifixit video this looks violent . This beats kill bill lol
Surely sapphire crystal at least on the cameras and inner displays at that price is a must?
As a c4-c5 quadriplegic with no finger movement, I am so grateful that you bring up that suggestion. Apple if you are watching, take notes.
Imagine skiing with a pair of these on watching JRE 🔥🔥
🤯 can you please destroy some RollsRoyce or Bugatti next time.
that’s how you properly disposed a 3500 apple vision pro😅
iphones do have scheduled text messages tho
plastic.. and it costs 3500? i suppose only the people that bought the apple trash can for 10k would get this.
Kkk
Your videos makes my soul in relax mode
His hatred towards Apple is on another level
The last apple product I owned was an iPhone 5. Ever since then, Ive been a Samsung galaxy owner. I took a new job which required me to carry a company phone. Sad to say its an iPhone 15. 😢
my boy jerry
What a waste. Thanks for generating more e-waste… these videos are getting old :/
Left m2 chip looks like utah
Such an amazing man
There are more accessibility settings check
Some people will destroy that in a matter of days. Goodbye 3500 dollars. They replicate your prescription lenses if your wear glasses....but it can't be anything too complicated like astigmatism so no, that thing won't be going mainstream anytime soon even if it was cheaper. Nor can they cure your claustrophobia, vertigo etc. We couldn't make 3d glasses stick around let alone goggles. BUT I came here to see you tear it apart not go into the long term health implications of any type of VR headset and you never disappoint!
It’s so easy to destroy.
This was too hardcore to watch
Do you think this will be covered by the warranty?
Not gonna lie ,this is a stupid test.
no drop test?
I wonder you scratch and teardown the Apple Vision Pro, then you’re realised you forget to push camera recording button.
Great video.. Apple always L**** About something.
The video we’ve all been waiting for…. 🎉
Unsa kaha hitsura sa taga apple ani nga video ba...hehehehe
Bunker video?
You can remove the speakers if you use a sim remover tool on the little holes near them
the price of this device makes no sense. and the fat battery pack makes me think im looking at 1st gen ipods all over again haha. how long until this tech (or better) can be crammed into regular sunglasses and reading glasses? 10 years? cant wait!
Wow! Bad destruction 🤣
It's a pic of crap
You savage!!!!
I can't watch this anymore?
Spend 3500$ just to destroy it.. seems legit
The video we’ve all been waiting for…. 🎉
“scratches at a level 3 and a deeper groove at a level 4” level 6: 👁️👄👁️
Plastic lenses in a 3500$ gadget is an underclass act.
Thank you so much - didn’t realize Apple promised you something you didn’t get or that its made of ‘plastic’. Have a you tried ambulance chasing or Tik Tok?
Apple comes out with this but wont try making a foldable iphone oh well
Si Tech Santos ve este video, le va a dar la garrotera
I might be the only one who enjoyed this teardown too much.  Thanks Jerry.
My heart! My Heart!! ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
4:17 that scratching gave me chills down my spine
The ironic part is the sewn knit headband strap costs $3000 and the rest of the hardware is only around 500 bucks.
How many views does it take to pay for that thing?
Oh boy 😮
12:59 Original chargers that didn’t come in the box 😂
Even though I could never offored the Vision Pro and I am not an Apple user, this hurt just a little to see this HALO product get so "tested" Being disabled this is forever out of my reach but I know for sure I could use it but thank you for what you do even if it hurts some times lol.
Love the Ready Player One reference at the end lol
$3500 would change my life right now & this man just tore it to pieces 🥺
Please, give it to me
While I appreciate these tear downs, if you’re not extra careful with this $3500 piece of tech, you deserve what you get.
imagine buying something that easy to damage. Stop falling for apples corner cutting trash.
imagine after destroying this peace of tech, discovering that you didn't hit the record  button
This device was designed, If you wear this you probably got laugh at, but once people realize it's apple and knowing the price everyone finally respect you but it will be -$4K out of your wallet.
Bro got tensed for his view getting divided.
The most brutal
11:28 I can understand why apple didn't give that accessibility feature.... but with no fingers... yeah that might be useful feature for'em
6:38  It looks like your first attempt damaged more than the glass😂 At least you know you have a good product
Interesting Year!!😂  We had scratches at level 7 with deeper groves at level 4.  Now we have scratches at level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4.
Jerry you have problems!!!!😭😭😭
This is easily the best use of any apple vision unit that will happen.
So, it's not plastic, it's glasstic. Like the inside screens of all foldables, but not as soft or cheap looking. Talking of Android flops, sorry, folds, who do you thinks gonna shamefully rip-off Apple's Vision Pro first? Who knows, it might also be rushed and made out of cheap grade 2 titanium. 🤭🤣
finally here. all that i need
3:13 - I mean, aren't they still getting the $500 back if the price is $299 with applecare but without is $799??😂
Bro always keep his words 😂😂when we ask cant wait to see level 5 scratch on vision pro last time he replied “soon” ❤
"Tears of loneliness"
Hypnotizing. Grate stuff. Someone had to do it.
Gives me whistlindiesel vibes lol
I have a question: why do companies have their logos or words or even QR codes all the way inside of their device hardwares?
Vision pro
scratches at level 6 and deeper grooves at level 7 is a god level.
Who called it Vision Pro and not "Apple of My Eyes"?
The wrist twist function is saved for the future hidden features 😮
Dude your the GOAT bro!
poeple are paying 3k for plastic wd ..guess apple know their base
Now you can" TRULY LOOK " Stupid For Buying a Logo
$3,500 for plastic 😂
Im curious about the sock or strap thing that you lit as this would be a fail in Britain and wouldn't be able to be sold
This hurt to watch.
Plastic? 😂😂
They managed to copy the hololens wholesale but with far shittier build quality.  As always Apple steals tech, paints it white, and claims to be innovative
Imagine buying an Apple vision pro and then destroying it, only a prat with more money than sense would do such a thing.
this was torture
gotta be honest, $3500 with plastic vital components that should be glass greatly frustrates me
Demonic destruction unbelievable , anything you can crush like that 👎👎👎👎👎
All jokes and price aside, I think this tech is actually wildly revolutionary. I recently saw that you can even have a virtual face time, and it will show your face somehow?? Like you could FaceTime with someone at the top of a virtual Mount Everest? This could improve work flow, without creating safety risks, it could help impaired people enjoy their devices and content, it can help with privacy for working with the virtual Mac screen!! I definitely hate apple, they’re a scummy company and money grabbing, but this, this right here, is actually revolutionary.
Forever thankful for bringing my intrusive thoughts to life!
vision pro 😶‍🌫️
Are you criticizing the most accessible tech company to not being accessible in this 35 hundred prototype development kit? There’s no need to be such a hater, Zack
I like the double blink idea
So I think third party repair guys can change the front lense if it's that easy to take off. Maybe they will make screen protectors if they are so easy to scratch. I hope Android makes a similar product. I just want to watch movies on it.
11:37 Idk about that Zach 😂
I'm 35 years old and I'm sure this channel has taken whatever years I have left away from me.
I hope nintendo is watching
This hurts to watch
Are you going to put it back together and sell it on the used market?
A usb-c can absolutely handle a moving user. I have used a usb-c battery pack on my quest 2 for the last year and have never had it unplug.
Hey Zack! Any chance you can do a Meta Quest 3 tear down? Please.. thank you!!
Awesome work!
Nice to see that cable is removable
I can't watch this because of how expensive the😊 product is
Jerry you are a monster 😩❤
This was hard to watch
The whiplash from last video featuring "Scratches at a level 7, with deeper grooves at level 8" to this video and its "Scratches at a level 3, with deeper grooves at a level 4" is real.
awesome destruction as always.
this hurts me to insane proportions
this gadget is cool also a waste of money
Can you play games on these?
Noooooooo Jerry Noooooo DONT DO IT!!!!!! 🫣🫣🫣
Well I'd been expecting this durability test video 😅😅😅  But I didn't expect this was also the tear down video
3:55 LMAOOO
Been waiting for this video since i saw MKB review the tech. "Cool cool...now let me see it destroyed 😈"
Sortealo, creo que puedo hacerlo funcionar 😊
Another videos of “destroying stuff you can’t buy” haha
I Need Likes 😅
It’s still a great machine. Just remember he spent $3500 on this headset so you don’t do what he’s doing. ❤
You think the apple vision pro got out too soon ?
Love how he threw an Easter egg in is vid. “ the oasis “. 😅 Ready player one
why am i suffering in vietnam
plastic infront of the cameras is inexcusable for that price, is glass hard to form in that shape?
This nearly made my heart stop.
You killed Apple Future 😂❤
"Don't let its small size fool you tho" - Zack, 2024
$3500 quest 2 with equally cheap material. Really unfortunate how many people are falling for it. Hopefully this doesn't become a pattern for overpriced junk like always after apple popularises an already existing product.
Damn this hurts to watch 😭
🤘
Still I'm gonna buy this shii
☠️
Jerry u be killing me with the destroying tech but this one made me glad, as a repair tech apple always makes it difficult for us to do our job
I loved how chaotic his teardown was. LOVED IT...
Watch phone repair guru
Crazy part is this thing probably costs 125 to make
I'd like to see you rigging the Cybertruck big man!
Its plastic what?! I’m on the edge of my seat waiting!
Nice gay goggles, but is there an Android version for real men?
5:51  water came out of my nose when he said - “…Tears of loneliness from entering into the motorized internals” 😂😂😂😂
wish he didn't just rip it apart :/
Re: 11:35 - There already are accessibility features to allow using the VP without hands.
The calm voice over with a violent tear down, you're a maestro brother!
3.5k with plastic front and 300 for repair with apple care plus or 800 without, what a scam
I would never have an apple device .
New tech, just give it to jerry and he will see how tough it is😆
Knew it wouldn't take long for these to pop up 🤣🤣
Apple Incision Bro
It took me awhile to develop a taste to watching people destroy expensive hardware.
Ah I wanted to see inside the battery unit, to see if there's any extra circuitry in there to communicate with the headset.
Wow. I paid $3800 for that . Impressive
In India it's 7 am and I see this the moment i woke up 😢
I don't understand, why did they use glass at all ?  Surely there are many other materials that are lighter and scratch just as easily while being cheaper to manufacture, so the glass literally has no function besides them being able to say "laminated glass" in their advertising ?  or am I missing something obvious...
GEEEZUS KRIST THIS ONE WAS MESSY!
Already waiting for the “How much titanium Apple used in vision pro” video
finally someone not comparing mAh but rather Wh, thanks @jerryrigeverything 11:53
I am surprised you don't scratch and bend test electric cars. lol
Salli salliya noruketane😂😂😂
This 😂 is tha reason way Jerry didn't get apple's 🍎 review unit's 😂😂😂😂😂
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
why in the world would apple choose laminated glass if the soft part is exposed? why not just full plastic. any one got a real idea besides to scam lol
I have a fondness for Jerry as a person, but I have to admit that his channel is not very helpful. Instead of providing informative tech reviews, he mostly just destroys devices in his videos. I don't think anyone who owns any phone or device would ever subject their own devices to such extreme conditions through daily use.
God I loved the finger clicking with the thing on his face at the end!!
1:17 More like knitted with the love of a thousand underpaid Chinese kids
People come here for tear down. I came here for comedy punches and sense of humour.
Watching this dude fuck up expensive apple products helps me sleep at night.
Apple finally made the ultimate non consumer friendly product
Last week Apple Store at Mall was open early selling Vision Pro.  Nobody was buying
First time on this channel here... I'm as far as possible to an Apple fanboy, however this is painful to watch 😥
Loved it! A truck driver wrecking a violin
The most sad part is when you see the internals , and externals and realize , the price should be 600 dls worth  and not 3500
this device is garbage....
Can you do another video showing how to put it back together?
I was already kinda surprised when the plastic scratched, but then when it melted with just the heat from a heatgun? Good god... makes me wonder though if maybe scratches could easily be smoothed out with heat
I suppose the good news is that exterior being scratched to hell after two weeks of use will have no effect on actually using the product…but still lol.  Scratching at a Mohs level of only 3 is insane.
I’ve worn glasses for almost 15 years and the best way I’ve found is cleaning them with foaming hand soap and running water to flush the soap and dust off them. I somehow doubt the skin goggles will be receptacle to my tried and true scratch and smudge free technique
Dam man common !!
This one was extra painful Zack, thanks
Braveeeeeeeee
Painful, i must say
Actually if you buy apple care and repair the glass, it will be a whopping 1 dollar cheaper than repairing without applecare. Very good investment
been waiting on this video!
It appears Zach gained an electrical tape bandaid during this teardown. Skin scratches at a level 1, deeper grooves at a level 2.
This is what im waiting for❤
Waiting for apple fans
Who would walk around wearing something like this?
Tear apart the battery pack for the Apple Vision Pro pleaseeee
7:13 I ain’t understand a word he said but it sounds good 😂
Thank you for the durability test! The VP will probably be far away from any keys or coins in my pocket (unlike my phone) but knowing its limits is good to know when I pick one up when they are in gen 2 or three.
10:10 vision pro cussing jerry for what he did to it😭💀
THIS IS PURE ASMR.. LOVE IT
For the algorithm
Now take it back in a bucket to see if Costco really takes everything back. Tell them it got damaged in shipping.
This hurts my soul! I like how he waited to use his mohs 9 pick splciefclty for the Apple Vision Pro!😂😂😂😂
This hurts me.
people with balls to have camp fire wound not buy this ...! just saying they just do camp fire artificially ..!
Don’t put your keys in the same pocket as your Vision Pro?
You are the best 🤣🤣🤣
Hey you can set up a scheduled text message no problem using the shortcuts app. Hope this helps 😀
Hey, to be fair to apple, if it wasn't so fragile, there would be no reason for everyone to buy another one next week. And clearly apple considers only selling one to each consumer a failure.
Apple PR Team, "So Jerry, I mean Zack, how'd you like the new Apple Vision Pro?" Zack, "It's SMOKIN!!!!!!!"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you want, but iPhones do have scheduled text messages. You do it in the automations where you would customise the app icons as well. For the past 2 or 3 years now I've had a scheduled text go to my friend everyday at 4:44pm and it says "Jay-Z O'Clock."
Early Access Garbage... alpha version 1.0
Dude I could’ve used that $3499 to get 09 Honda accord 😢
2:35 there is a screen protector tho. According ifix it
Tears of loneliness 😂
If Zack didn’t loose that one screw, he could have put it back together.
😂 6:01
Was eagerly waiting for this after MKBHD’s vid 🙌🏻
I was born with congenital retinal folds and have had a retina detachment, glaucoma and lenses implants.  This all means that I have poor eye sight (legally blind and glasses can't help), my eyes do not function together and do not look directly at what I am focusing on.  I am assuming all of this would make this thing useless to me since it relies so heavily on eye tracking.  I have an old Quest Go which is really difficult for me to use anyway since there is no way to get closer to the images and text.
What the hell is this?  Whistling Diesel for Apple products???
Zach is a lot like the "Engineers" from "Prometheus".. Just ripping apart our primitive Technology to make way for their advanced Biotechnology
Between this and the Fold I feel like we need a "glass is glass, and plastic is not" shirt
I hate to say this, but this was way more interesting than i expected
Lol, that’s what I would call a total tear down....
I am now fully convinced that if you are not rich to buy all these apple products outright that they are being designed to keep you in debt to apple for life 👀
What an absolute chad.
$3500 .......destroy just like that......i in alot of pain right now.....
I would love to see the expression of apple engineers who worked on this when they see this video 😁
Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas had me ded af.
Other videos calling glass out here lying
The front glass comes off!
You just destroyed something that i can never have:)
I'm so happy you did this, I was very seriously tempted to smash mine on the ground to see the guts but now I don't have to!!  ....or do I?
It's crazy hearing Apple talk about "recycled materials" when they actively cause massive amounts of e-waste by making their devices fragile and hard to repair...
Scheduled text messages are so great to have. So much better than a blue text bubble.
This thing looks like a complete joke toy
Me at 10:42 I guess this thing isn't going back together. Oh hey! It's Utah.
Nothing is safe from Zach. You're next.
iPhone DO HAVE schedules messages LMAO, and have had since at least the iPhone 4.
Postmortem of Apple vision pro
the fact that this is 3500 dollars blows my mind
@6:41 you can see the Vision Pro has fought back!!!! 😂
Scratches at level 4...I'll wait for the Vision Pro 2....and an extra paycheck
And with this I've gotten all the entertainment out of VR i need for the next 10 years without spending a dime.  Thanks Jerry!  VR remains a gimmick for bored people with excess money. These just like everything that came before them will be collecting dust for the vast majority of purchasers within a few months.
$3500 USD for garbage. No surprises with this one
It’s like How To Basic, with a $4100 play thingie. 😂
All I can imagine is somewhere an Apple Engineer that worked years on the project is bawling their eyes out in bathtub watching you do this.
oh man this hurtsssssss
11:31 😂😂😂😂😂 Zack mode on
AppleTrack's sam actually tried the drop test, and surprisingly the fromt glass didn't break until it was way above his head. And even if the glass broke, it was still useable
"Apple vision pro is not designed to be repaired". Apple as usual is so ecological it's amazing. They should get mother nature to check the Apple Vision Pro and let's see what she will say
I thought the s24 teardown was pricey.... then you manage to get your hands on this.  Wow.
1000 grandma's 😂luv it
WWTTTFFFFF
Apple:Introducing Apple Vision Pro  MKBHD:Let me review this Apple Vision Pro  Jerry: "Say no more,I am gonna end Apple whole career with Jerry Rig Knife ,as you can see scratches at level 3 with deeper groves at level 4  Me:Watching in the middle of the night.😅😅😅
Holy smokes i thought that would be real glass! plastic front? this thing will live short
* It's plastic
Omg this was difficult to watch!! That poor Vision Pro!
It's now a very expensive sleep blind.
Jerry destroys everything 😂
The biggest question answered as soon as it was released.
This hurt my heart and I cannot finish the video
Apple has scheduled text messages... it's in shortcuts --> automation
Jerry Jerry Jerry ❤ … you are the best! No one bothered but you knew what we wanted. Go get them!
This was almost as disturbing and entertaining as watching them cartel videos
So there 3d/Vr goggles?
2 recent videos … scratches at a level 7 deeper groves at an 8 on the S24 Ultra…now this!?!?! 😂
Ahhh! I loved pulling lenticular lenses out of old projector tvs!  Fun for projects!
Apple Engineers are going to be real mad seeing this one 💀
Wt
We just witnessed scratches at level 7 - 8 and shortly after scratches at level 2 - 3
8:08 ✌🏻
$3500. for cheap plastic! 😂
50 juta di odol-odol 🫡
Imagine paying 1300 dollars for a battery replacement
Imagine if it's metal and how uncomfortable it is 😂
He made back what he paid for the VisionPro in views after less than a minute. 😂
You look like Judge Dredd….tech justice has no soul.
Sorry but I cannot justify the price no matter how good it is.  Meta Quest all the way 👀
iphones have the availability to send scheduled messages btw jerry
Yes!! Finally!! Thanks Zach!
$4K for something that anyone who wears glasses can’t use. Pathetic!!
Scratches at level 3 and it cost an arm and a leg 🤯🤯
0:30 I was today years old when I learned that iJustine is not only still active after more than a decade, but now is a tech reviewer of all things.
Not gonna lie, this seems like a huge step forward for VR/AR, which is a huge shock to me being that its Apple making this step (the notoriously 4 years behind everyone else company). Cant wait to see what comes out once other companies improve on it making make it affordable.
I've had the same pair of glasses with cheap polycarbonate lenses for 8 years, and have used toilet paper or paper towel to clean them every single day for that entire 8 years, and there are very, very few small scratches on the lenses, not enough to notice when wearing them. So that isn't always true.
Yikes on that outer glass. Or to quote Little Missfortune: yikes forever
your knife hurts my little budget :s
$3,500 for a plastic “glass” screen! What a load of crap. I’m a die hard Apple fan
This is the most disturbing video I ever seen i feel my heart breaking with each scratch 😢
Prediction: this video will be in trend in 3,2,1 ...
i can smell the smoke
That tap after teardown😂 epic
Truly, watching your video is more chilling than the scariest horror movie 😂 .
The desire to have a unified front panel for aesthetic purposes is going to be a real problem when the place that is most likely to get scratched is where the cameras are. Will turn already rough cameras into blurry cameras in no time at all.
Oooh apple is going to be upset😂
i just watch this stuff cause breaking expensive shit is great
No one should put fire that close to any apple product
Scratch tests on the metal are like fingernails on a chalkboard!  😢
is this covered by apple care
So after almost $5000 dollars for the apple vision pro plus apple care and  taxes almost $5000 dollars and the front glass scratches that easily, well apple is special isn't 🤔🤫
Does it have anything to do with it being lenticular?
Noice video my guy ❤
Apple always makes the second or third generation of a product much better.  I'm interested on this but I'm going to wait on it.  Seems like a cool concept that could use a few rounds of improvement.
Halliday would be proud
A day to mark in the history books, Zack finally cut himself during a durability test
Tried this what they don't tell you is the interior screens suck there is a black border around everything and the display is severely distorted on the edges.  Also, it's HEAVY, and your face sweats.
I want to have my mom try this, she's a C6 quad but can do the turn-her-wrist-to-pinch motion, I wonder if it will recognize that
Everyone looks like a total dork wearing that thing but you actually pull it off quite well! 👍
Can you please put on a pair of cut resistance gloves...
imagine spending years engineering a masterpiece and then watching a youtuber absolutely destroy it
Cool, I'll wait for it to be $8000, not look incredibly stupid, and have true sapphire outer (and inner) lenses with no outer plastic. And then I still won't buy it cause I can't afford it as it is in the first place.
Yikes
Like for the 1000's grandma's ❤
THE OASIS!!! Cultured man
that hurt to watch. 😬
front laminate is actually pathetic.
I used to despise watching Jerry rigging a brand new device, but now I watch and sometimes even wait to watch him rigging devices for curiosity of my mind 😅.  My 2-6 year younger self would not have believed that I waited for him to tear down iPhone 15 pro & S24 ultra!!!
Bro just destroying my dream tech
This is insane. Someone has to do it, and that’s our Jerry.
everytime Jerryscratch the AppleVisionPro
This video hurt.
I CRACKED at 8:35 with the debris hanging and waving from the flow of the heat gun, it was so funny, the destruction was only beginning even tho it looked to hilariously destroyed already, love ur vids man, I knew u were gonna make one of Vision Pro, thanks
Really thought we was at least getting Goriila Glass Victus for that price.
I expected scratches at a level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8
This is what they call "enter the matrix"  then and breaks it apart 😂
😳 so cringe!
Wow, scratches at level 3 and deeper grooves at level 4 was very painful the watch
Hahahahahaha "tears of loneliness". You made me laugh hard on that part.
Waiting for him to put it back together still.
Apple discovering this video 👁️👄👁️
Was anyone else blowing on their screen when he lit the headband on fire? 😂
Jerry is Apple 🍏 Destroyer
This was hard to watch
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
Hmmm… wrist move… 🤔
seeing how small the actual screens are is mindblowing
Hard to watch ❎️ Hard while watching ✅️
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE YIKES
Of course its plastic, what you're expecting ? glass to break on the first fall ?
holysheet this is brutal
You're telling me that for $3,499.99 I could buy one Vision Pro or 233 Jerry Rig knives?!
What a waste  😢
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢
If you can't repair it you don't own it. That's an expensive rental 😮
Plastic lenses? Plastic over crucial sensors? What a joke. Always behind the curve in features and hardware. Definitely paying the "apple" tax on this $800 to make headset.
Could you give it to me ?
No comment on the thumb wound at 6:40? Electrician's bandage.
I understand the point of this channel. I get it. But if it isn't blindingly obvious when you attack a piece of hardware, even outrageously expensive new Apple tech, that it will scratch, break, or be otherwise damaged, you really shouldn't be buying that sort of stuff in the first place.
Who the F will treat something that cost this much would do this    this mean nothing
new Iphone breaks headset is a $3500 plastic paper weight oh how they have fallen lmao
Damn who hurt you?😆
It’s plastic?? Really? That’s just… Wow… Just wow.
Using the knife to slice the glue is a ballsy move One slip and there goes your finger
In before Apple strikes this
It’s totally plastic?
I'm gonna have a heart attack
Thanks for all these tear down videos! Although I kinda cringe every time I watch a tech gets destroyed
It seems very possible to make accessible but is just not quite there, still aimed at fully able moving people.
RIP, $3500.
I’m happy people like you can do tear downs like this so I don’t have to
Ese final epico 😂
Tears of loneliness! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
you should take teardown lessons from ifixit crew yooooo whats that 😂😂😂😂😂
Shit
i was waiting for this
Um, I get this is what he does when he's not digging a hole in his backyard to wait out a (VERY) short Armageddon (how much food, water and sewage disposal does one need to wait out a nuclear winter?) But really? I don't remember any Rivians or Mopping floor vacuums being scratched or set fire to.  This is strictly performative. As if it's a value to the buying of a $3,500 Gen 0.1 moonshot to know that the screen scratches at 3 or the headband is flammable.  I think he should spend more time building Not Wheelchairs.   FanBoys. Pounch!
I have a feeling in the future Apple won't even be considering using cameras to look at your hands in order to use hand gestures- the entire device would likely be controlled by scanning our brain waves and interpretting signals as commands.
I mean it being plastic can take some pain buuuuut at the price it should be glass
“Scratches at level 3, with deeper groves at a level 4” this is revolutionary!
Loved this video although did it still it work?🧐
Engineering mastery
Reminder: you don’t actually see THROUGH the thing.
Vision Pro Engineers: 😧
About time Jerry
It’s haram
This shows how careful  the @phone repair guru is while opening and closing the Apple Vision. He somehow managed to manage it opening and closing while still in working condition.   Kudos to him gor his hard-work
Apple Vision Pro,nah more like Apple Blind Noob!
Don't worry guys, they'll soon launch the iGlass protector for $100
I was waiting  to watch this type of test $3500 big scratch 😂
Scratches at lvl 3, with deeper groves at level 4, with lvl 8 penitrating through your eyes pocket
Definitely a wait until they make it so it can't be ruined on the entire face if scratched by literally anything harder than plastic.
Apple seems always make new tech these days utilizing tech from the late 80s/early 90s. Those lenticular, holographic screens remind me of the year 1990 specifically when I entered the public school system and those lenticular films were used in bookmarks. Funny how tech hasn’t really evolved.
put those screens in the quest 3 please
It doesn't survive😢
Watching you tear up $1300 phones makes me squirm. I can't watch this 😅
brutal lol
This was so painful to watch.
I have scheduled text messages on my iphone with the shortcuts app
Getting apple repairs be like the repair is 3000$ or we have this brand new one for 3500$ then you buy the new and the old gets fixed for 6 cents and resold for 3000$ lol
"Knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas" 🤣🤣🤣 now that's something I never thought I'd hear about an apple product!
“The time will come, to do what I do” - my new phrase for my girl
PRG Reactions: 👁️👄👁️
Now film yourself returning them to Best Buy for a full refund.
Wooo a new homepod...
This is hard to watch but I’m glad you do this stuff
Laminated Plastic
Keep in mind, even the 400 dollars Meta Quest 3 uses GLASS for its pancake lenses, but this 3500 dollar Apple headset uses PLASTIC lenses.
3500 gone in just 5 minute i love this
Wonder if you voided the warranty 🤔😂
I wasn't READY for the reference at the end.
Worst video ever. No peeking at the speaker's ball. 0/10
The destruction! I can't watch...
for something that 3500$, plastic is an odd choice to go with
Yep that's how Jerry does it 😂😂
This video was not very easy to be watched. But, anyway, congratulations on the power to put fire in U$ 3.500,00.
Apple Vision Pro cost $3500 USD / $5,300 AUD and yet Apple has the nerve to make the front screen plastic.
ODIO SER POBRE
Great video, but as a VR enthousiast seeing a headset this expensive get totally obliterated still kinda hurts.
11:38 Your 'Blinking' accessibility idea is a pretty good option.
Now I want a Harry Potter universe for the apple vision pro so i can have actual  duels and pretend it's real
It broke during the scratch test? That's wild.
Try sending the remains into Apple Care!
Lmao, how is this not false advertisement?
This is so satisfying 😂
repairability is not an afterthought, unrepairability is the forethought
Stupid Question Did You Do The Giveaway For The Phones Yet 😰😨😫
So you pretty much have to buy a new 1 if something goes wrong. I hate greedy tech companies making everything as non-repairable as possible smh
its probably plastic for weight reasons
Have you considered getting a NATO strap for your F91W?
5:49 “Tears of loneliness” 😭
It’s glass tho
He should have disassembled that battery. I bet there are electronics in that thing to help the main computer.
The CARNAGE. I'm here for it!!!!
Go put it on the genius bar see if they can figure out why it won't power on
hace cuantoa años se desecho la tecnologia de gafas de realidad aumentada por ser basura??? y Apple trae de nuevo esa tecnologia y aun mas ridiculamente invasiva, solo falta que tengas que cargar encima una bateria de tesla para aliemtarla y otros 6 cables conectados a todo.....   🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
The ending is everything 😂😂😂
The Sheer GIRTH.😏
jerry, the screen "glass" does come off
Apple does have scheduled messaging you just don’t know how to use it lmao use short cuts and automations
I can’t wait for Dbrand to make some Skins for the outer screen of the Vision Pro.
Tears of Loneliness 😭 spot on
The most expensive teardown ever I think
Bruh I love how he always so calm and talking slowly but then in the video at the same time he is literally obliterating every he sees and then explains how does that part works lmao💀
Sooo Apple name of plastic lens is lamenated glass 😂😂😂
at this point I'm getting used to scratching expensive gadgets. all for science of course
impressive
Holy moly! It was savage 😂
No wonder it broke... it's an Apple
I haven't clicked on a video so fast in months, this is the content that I didn't know I needed in my life 😂
For some strange reason, seeing this video was painful....😮
Missed opportunity: testing how the pass-through vision works after some level 4 deeper scratches.
Apple put plastic on the outside so it scratches and glass on the inside so it breaks. Genius planned obsolescence
The one device where a teardown skin from dbrand doesn't make much sense 😅 though maybe they should do one that entirely covers up the front display just for the memes since it sucks anyways
Can we get a moment of silence for his bank account?
Sounds like that smooth head of yours was really grooving inside of the solo knit headhand hahaha 😂
Oh no. I was perfectly happy with my iPhone but now that I just realized that I should want scheduled messages I feel incomplete..
I love your videos, but watching this one hurt my soul ...
jerry is that spoiled child who never got a chance to ripped off his toys in his childhood now taking revenge by ripping off expensive toys that barley people can afford.
You should’ve done a scratch test on the lenses. That’s what really matters.
Ahh this hurts me to watch 😳
Never expected it
this man has a special skill to humiliate and appreciate at the same time 😂😂  that's a special skill to have..
As dumb as I think it is, I have to admit it is a pretty unbelievable piece of technology
no way
This thing is a paid prototype to fund the next model which will be the real first one
I've Been Waiting For This thanks Jerry
3500$ for a big piece of plastic… shocker… 😂
Ok but that magsafe anker charger was actually sick
Build quality is definitely 💩
It’s a first gen product for few users which wanted one at any cost and at any inconvenience 99% viewers will never buy one
i think some of it is they wanted to cut down the weight.
Waste of money
Other youtubers: lets review apple vision pro… i love this shit Jerry: i love this thing… lets open this shit😂
Once again i still think this is a terrible product and apple is delusional for calling this the future replacement for the smartphone.
The effective way of telling companies to NOT TO SEND THE REVIEW PRODUCTS…😂
Lol, Jerry, you did know that iFixit already did a 'gentle' teardown, right? 😅
3:00 for all of this product's faults, I dont think plastic on the front is one of them. If it was glass it would weigh more and crack, which would make the headset dangerous to use for fear of glass shards making their way into your eyes or hands. Also less likely to cover the cameras this way   Yikes, interior glass lenses? Now that's a mistake
Scratch an Apple, find plastic. "Glass," my ass.
But will it still work when reassembled?
Zach reviews are so unbiased. It’s awesome to see, even as an Apple user
as a musician, 12ms makes it garbage, 3ms minimum
screaming all time..
Ufff, me dolio ver este video sabiendo el precio 😢😢
$3,500? 😬
Apple designed a product that's meant to be basically impossible for customers to repair? Say it ain't so, boss!! I would have never guessed! 🥲
Did Apple send you that unit, or was this a really expensive video?
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you GoogleGlass 2.0...this piece of junk will be discontinued by Labor Day 🤣
This truly hurt me to watch.
Did not except apple to cheap out on lenses and front "glass". After all Apple is known for its over the top build quality.
Apple Vision Pro scratch at a level 3 with deeper groove at a level 9
I guess plastic is probably better than glass which is more easily shattered
Alex from NorthridgeFix would have a nice task here...
This is the video that we needed. And jerry absolutely crushed that piece of junk. Though he likes it. But it makes us look like a clown if we wear that and go out in public.
Great content.  Question.  So if you wear glasses, do you have to buy extra lenses in order to use the vr head set. And if there are extra lenses for people who wear glasses, how much more are they? They, being apple, should have used the ceramic shield  coating on the front. And was the weight of the vr on your head heavy?
out of everything ive seen, this was the hardest to watch.
But those Grand Canyon level grooves left behind by a Level 9 Pick, tho. (9:15)
If you can donate to me what's left of this unit, I could use a break in life, even if it's a broken unit. I'll fix it.
Jesus will fulfill you more than anything in this world, I speak from experience (from when i did Romans 10:9-13), he loves you and wants to be in a meaningful (not romantic) relationship with you. :)   “that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭9‬-‭13‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭15‬ ‭KJV‬‬  If you want proof that Jesus and the Bible are true look a documentary called “Ron Wyatt discoveries 2022” on YouTube and a YouTube channel called Expedition Bible. They both examine archeological sites and discoveries that prove the Bible, and even reference secular sources.  (Just don’t convert to 7th day Adventism after watching the documentary) And lastly if you don’t know the gospel and want to be saved search up “abc’s of Salvation Teenmissions” on Google and it should be the first or second result. When you click on it read the whole thing, and do what it says and have faith in Jesus while you are doing it, do not doubt, and if it is hard for you to do what it says, ask Jesus to help you, have faith that he will, and *he will.*  God Bless :)
Tears of loneliness...
3500 dollars for a plastic shit!!!!!
Reminds me of the laminate on the switch oled. Plastic then glass
I can fix em bro
wanted to see the battery pack teardown so badly 😢
You can schedule texts on an iPhone
Apple sure does a good job of making expensive e waste
Many were waiting on this video.
I like the humor in your video this time, you are awesome man
So happy to see you blow 4k on this
Why did they do that... I don't know who could've thought that unremovable front plastic layer is a good idea, lol.
Zack Nelson vs Apple Vision Pro fight.   Zack Nelson facing off with Vision Pro swipes holographic screen and said    This isn't just augmented reality      it's augmented durability.......  Time To see if AR/VR can handle durability tests
I feel a little traumatized. That hurt a little bit just watching.
nearly $4000 for plastic is insane lmfao
How do you know that those glasses are plastic?
Typical apple high price, cheap quality, but sucker fan boys swallow it up like a seagull
Shoutout to iJustine and MKBHD was a nice one 😅
I would have loved to have seen it put back together! 😂
Looks like your hand is almost as fragile as the head gear
Intrusive thoughts this video is
Go go go go!!!
its crazy that you could get a valve index for just the price of a glass replacement on this thing i know they're quite different but thats daylight robbery if you ask me
i want version 2 air and controllers for games
Will never buy one because its first gen. Ill wait for a few years until they’re a bit more… polished and durable.
Thank fuck it's not glass..
Love it 🙌
these will never not hurt my soul. thank you
so apple made 67000 units… You gotta wonder if they made a few extras to account for this happening. They definitely know what Zack does to their products 😂
Wow, he just wrecked that gadget ... This was pre-meditated!
“Tears of loneliness “😂😂
Where’s the battery tear down?!
They should create more fabric stuff like the band it’s so cool
Children in Africa could've eaten that Apple vision pro. What a waste
Never has a teardown physically pained me this much
I have never hated and loved a product so much. Some of the things they have accomplished with this are amazing but its not a finished product. It gets me excited for what is to come in the future BUT that is about it. Also yeah the fact that it is plastic is also just another massive kick in the face.
A cut on your thumb at level 7😂😂
Next video - tear down of skyscraper.
My guy said the love of a 1000 grandma's funny 🤣
I swear I could smell smoke when you were lighting the sock lol
Damn!! If you are telling me you liked an apple product this much, that means I definitely need to buy it, truly impressive.
Battle  Apple: Vision Pro burning   Again: people cooking with Vision Pro
I’m really glad you did a video on this, i always love your teardown videos and was worried this one wasn’t gonna make the cut. It’s also very uncanny hearing you speak highly of Apple, so that was fun!
Love the vid but it kinda hurts watching that thing get ripped apart knowing how much it cost 😂.
Now I will definitely wait til the 8th version when they make it like the meta 3
Been waiting for this!!
wonder if the "medicated prescription" lenses are actual glass
6:15 "But the sheer girth makes any flex impossible" Oh that's where you're wrong Jerry. At $3500, there's plenty of flex with this toy. 😆
😮😮😮😮
Может по гарантии вернуть можно
The headset can be controlled completely through audio cues and is perfect for people with accessibility issues. No need for a wrist twist as you mentioned. I was surprised in your iPhone video that almost all of your gripes are easily achievable (granted scheduled texting is not and would be awesome to have.)  It seems like you don’t do a lot of research before putting your videos out.  lf you would have browsed the accessibility settings you would have seen that voice control options exist. You are kind of a journalist with your videos and I think it would be prudent to have people looking over your script or doing a bit more research before sending these videos out to millions.  Someone with a disability that watches your videos may get the wrong idea about this product, which could drastically improve their life, especially if they have hand and other mobility issues.
✌️
I had such anxiety watching this
Was that the LTT precision screwdriver???👀
Literally me watching this 👉🏽😢
This dude is a psychopath
apple products not really low cost user friendly but only rich people friendly.
I really can’t watch Zack’s videos with headphones on the knife kills me close up
How can Apple make 4 thousand dollars so fragile? 😑
This one got me😢
$3,500 and the inner lenses are worse than the Quest 3. That is embarrassing.
You just saved me 3.5K ❤
scheduling a text message to be sent out ahead of time is possible, it’s not as straightforward as scheduling it in iMessage. Instead, the process has to be set up as an automation in the Shortcuts app.
This tear down was pure violence!! 😅😅
Tan caro y frágil, gracias por el contenido
I think the laminant being on the outside has something to do with people crashing into walls or hitting objects against the glass where if it shatters, having a non laminated side on the outside can lead to shards falling outwards and being a hazard. If you saw the one drop test someone else did, they commented about how well the glass prevented any cuts from both sides.
And we went from a ground breaking durability progress in the s24 ultra to overpriced apple marketing product's using plastic instead of the glass they advertise
Exceptionally Man-Handled by your's truly. 👌👌
Meta quest 3 is where it’s at for a fraction of the cost.
Tell me where you drop it plsss
@ 5:10, i can no longer watch you destroy $3,500 worth of equipment. i know this is what you do, but i just cant believe you would destroy something that costs more than many people earn in a month.
Finally 🎉😅
Apple care for this is $500?  Plus a $300 deductible?    Thats probably close to what apples cost is landed.
teardown 👍
Considering the price of this device, this video deserves HUGE LIKE! Nice to see Apple finally inventing!
i think a lot of the costs just go into the meaningless crap they bundle in, like the crappy headphones, when you could just have bluetooth or a 2.5/3.5mm jack. the stupid "3d" eyes, why do i want to pay more for someone else to see a screen of my eyes? lol. they could have reduced the costs so much but then couldn't justify the inflation with all the jargon.
I need less screen time. I get it though, it is cool idea but I'm not sure its for me.
11:20 me trying to fix my heart after she left it in pieces.
I watched this just to hear deeper grooves at level 7, but we ended up with deeper grooves at level 4 😅
6:58 LTT Precision driver?
You wore glasses? Wow. That's news
So can't repair it your self and the most vulnerable part of the device isn't covered by apple care. Yep sounds like an apple device.
90 day warranty right? Is that correct APPLE?
I’ll take that broken thing don’t worry
For 3.5K they give you PLASTIC SCREEN!? WTF, Thanks Jerry, you saved me a lot of money!
Bro this costs 3k 🥺
been waiting for this
god, I was waiting for this
The tear down i didn't know i needed until i watch it. Lmao
Use to wear glasses???
man thanks God, this is a dev kit sold and a finished product, lies!
bhai toda kyu yrr isse aacha mujhe de deta 😭
There is actually glass underneath the plastic outer cover
every time you take that JerryRig Razor Knife out to scratch metal surfacesI have to cover my ears or mute the video. I hate that sound. it scratches my brain
this is giving me tearing down a terminator face peice
I think the real question here is.. are we seeing a glimpse of what Apple envisions for the Apple car? A future of no windows, pure automation void of human interaction. It’s a slippery slope from here and we’re already falling.
After view just a handful of your teardown videos I have come to the conclusion phone companies suck at DFMA... too many screws
If you pay apple care, you still have to pay extra 300 us for that cheap front glass!??
2:41 Scratch at a level 3 or a level 2?? It really looks like I can start to see something at a level 2! 😆 Don't even breath on it!
You 'using' the broken Vision Pro at the end 😂
“That’s okay, I like a challenge.” And that’s why I love this man 😂
Apple *itself* requested Jerry to do durability test of his brand new *Apple Vision* 😁🤣😂
But did it smell like apples while it burnt?
Most expensive test
It physically hurts watching him scratch the hell out of this.. but so satisfying to watch it get destroyed as well. This is the best vison pro review! Lolll cheers!
It hurts to watch
The inside hardware of the Vision Pro might as well be literal magic for how much I understand of it. I feel like a caveman looking at it.
There is a plastic film over it. The ifixit tear down showed the film peeling up
They should give sapphire at this price point.very disappointing
headband isnt made from the love of 1000 grandmas. its made from the blood sweat and tears of chinese children
i will say anker stuff is great i love their usb typec  to usb  cables :)
Impressive it was still working for him at the very end when he was tapping.
I’m genuinely surprised you bought this to destroy. I thought $3500 was too much even for you but boy was I wrong😂
We all know that the Apple Vision Pro is not designed to be repaired, it's designed to be land waste.
you should have scratched the glass in front of the cameras and then used the device again to see if the scratches really do cause a problem. oh well
I think my life is just fine without this $3500 plastic purchase.
Zack: I fear no man... BUT THAT THING... *"scratches at level 3"* IT SCARES ME.
Imran chaudhary is coming up with new device to rival Apple vision pro
This was amazing!  I love that you use your smartphone protocol for this device as well.  Interesting to see that, for the price, you get an eggshell fragile system best suited for a padded room.  The design of the hardware is impressive, and the camera system is incredible. The monitors are equally impressive, but the surrounding support and lenses is a bit disappointing.  For something that is critical to the entire experience, I would have thought that a pair of glass lenses would have provided better protection and clarity, though I suppose it depends on the weight/density trade-off.  I must say, this was a very educational video, as well as enlightening in regards to the future of VR/AR.
This one was brutal
The fact they still put the apple logo on the chips that most people will not see, is just Incase someone like Jerry opens their devices up.
I can’t watch it
I’m enjoying how many different was there are to review this thing. Almost everyone has a similar consensus (“it’s awesome. Don’t buy it.”), but is getting there in drastically different ways. This is one of most interesting and surprising I’ve seen.
Now that you’re done with it…Can I have it?👍👍👍
You’ll get glass shards all over breaking that.
This is how to trash $3500
This is awesome haha
Tears of loneliness 😅😅😅😅
Apple could release a Apple turd pro and people would buy it.
In the words of jack black you're not hardcore unless you live hardcore.....
Zack April is not that far away, i have an idea for april fools, buy some Apple Mac Pro Wheels Kit's and make some rollerskates and depict them as being sold by apple lol
The only review I trust.
I don't nor do I plan on getting anything from Apple but this was heartbreaking to watch😂
More typical Apple garbage!
It's a guarantee this video will be number 1 trending in the morning.
Watching him destroy stuff u can’t buy at 3am keeps me sane
This is so painful to watch 😭
so this means an aftermarket company will mill a housing out of titanium as an upgrade for the weight issues that are being pointed out.
3500 for that piece of shit 😂
3500 for that piece of shit 😂
I thought you were doing durability tests, not Savage tear downs. You’re supposed to throw the thing around drop it due to it what a child would do to it that type of thing but OK
"knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas" lol
Kisi ko channel buy karna hai? Reply
Loved how he said “Anker can portably keep you in the OASIS for hours” it’s homage to the fact that the Vision Pro looks like the headset from Ready Player One , can’t wait for the sequel
Second time cutting finger?
The vision pros are dope but they wont be a solid purchase until they come in a sunglass form
More like stitched by a thousand Chinese kids, we know how Apple work.
Negative review for the Vision Pro. There was no 'like a lego' in it.
I can’t watch the razor parts man, it’s what’s holding me back from watching more of your videos. I can’t do it😭😭
This is a great video, Thank you Zack. I'm Just wondering, If glass will add weight, why use it in a way you don't take advantage?
Was waiting for the Ready Player One reference!
Thank you bro for saving my money
I love that Apple engineers and board execs watched this video and had a collective meltdown.
Everyone realizes the truth as jerry
@ $3500 i could buy an acre of land somewhere in uganda
$3,500 USD of plastic... 😮
Only Zack use electric tape as bandage 🩹 😂
Being poor, watching this gives me some weird feeling 🤣
Here we gooo
"The Apple Vision Pro is not designed to be repaired." Why am I not surprised?
I don’t know why, but my feelings are hurt watching this video 😂 😞
can't watch this video... makes me sad
Hmmm he didnt start out with a piece of tape as a bandaid on his thumb  lioks like the jerry rig knife is perty sharp 😂
The time comes for the Apple Vision to pass by Zack's hands😅❤
As someone who used a Oculus Go with an external battery bank, a right angle micro usb cable handled being worn on my face just fine for years. Apple could have used a right angle usb-c cable, but you can bet your last dollar that wouldnt have been maliciously apple enough for them.  Apple basically copied what everyone else did... but worse for a LOT more money.
feels like it was knitted with the love of a thousand grandma's LOL
One of China's finest overpriced objects, that some people waste their money on! Thanks for the truth of apple products! 😂😊. Use your money wisely! 🤯😱
Apple is most likely using a formed piece of plexiglass for Vision pro. Actual tempered glass would be to fragile with those dramatic rounded corners.   I know the tech world has a strange dissatisfaction with any kind of plastic in expensive products and I can somewhat understand, that being said this was the right move, pure glass would of been a durability nightmare.
Spending $3.500 on this is just so... Immoral. Even if you're rich as hell. Yes, I know, everyone can do whatever they want with their money, but, come on.
Fascinating tech and internal design and Im not an Apple user.
Before people panic, the front was always going to be plastic. Glass on the front, being as big as it is, would’ve been WAY too heavy to be practical.
3 to 5 years everyone that has this will have brain or eye cancer 😢
God bless all of you and remember God loves you all and so do I may God be with you all. Jesus is coming soon God bless repent🙏💛
First 🥇 hour I'm here Jerry ❤
As someone who despises all things Apple, this was entertaining 😅
Very surprised you never removed the side arms. They're also removable with a SIM tool
You know there’s an app for iPhone you can get to schedule texts.  🤷‍♂️
Honestly I'd be scared if it was genuine glass. It already has horrendous weight distribution, a metal body, and no ability to use the battery pack as a counterweight.
Spoilers: In this video you will see the Soft Wrinkly Band Pro on fire 🤣
Watching you scratching and destroying the Vision Pro gives me chiils
I was excited about the iPhone until the G1 came out... I feel like this is the same.
One day one of these companies is going to do a JerryRigEverything style tear down of one of Zacks wheelchairs (and probably buy a few for people to excuse the vandalism of the product)
The best youtuber🎉
You f'king did it!
3500 usd end in 13 minutes.. 🥲
Really interesting internal design
The question is does it still work?
jerry the demon 😭😭😭
apple (does not) care damn that thing has so many steps to take apart
this one hurt to watch!
Just whyyyy
How much is the titanium Apple Vision Pro? Also how much lighter on your face?
This is truly saddening to watch. Ty none the less
if it was glass it would feel like 20 damn pounds on  your head
Plastic is plastic and plastic scratches
Most satisfying things to watch in 2024!😮
Even though I hate Apple, this product is really Visionary. The quality is worth the price if they get more games and uses like other VR/AR headsets. Really wonderful for their 1st gen product.
Would've liked to know wether the battery bank is plastic or metal.. unfortunate that that wasn't adressed. Although caring about that feels like the utmost silly thing, that's just what were here for
Definitely Not an Apple sponsored Video 😂
It's weaker than we expected 👇🏻
bro is destroying 3500$ worth of hardware with no emotions
I've been waiting for this video
send me one :)
God. Jerry destroying this made my skin crawl. I Hate Apple (currently texting with) But, when Jerry scrapes stuff with the blade… brutal
Could I have this one?
VisionOS has full dwell accessibility built it
OHHH CRAP!! HERE WE GO!!!
That was painful
Was this the most expensive tear down ? Actually a tear 😢 down
3:51 two trailer park girls
Maybe it should just be a hard plastic front on which you stick googly eyes
glass under the plastic, fk lol
Very disrespectful and personal
Didnt they have an apple word for plastic with the iPhone 5C days or am I crazy😂? Feels like asking for trouble marketkng it as glass instead of using the word they already have coined with the iPhone 5C.
Wow this one is going to be interesting.
It’s giving to be interesting to see how they build on the accessibility they already have. Like for example, those who are blind or visually impaired like myself. If this is the future, let’s make it a future for everyone!
Can you please please please do a comparison with Xreal Air 2 glasses? It's literally 1/10 of the price.
One guy apple shouldn't have sent the product to.
teardown was so violent you can tell Jerry is an Android fan just by watching the video
thanks for throwing away 3500 + tax to show us the insides. cheers.
Send displays and surviving chips to Zeptobars for microscope inspection :-)
always good to see an apple product get wrecked.
@jerryrigeverything, can I have that extra oem  battery if you dont need it
Tears of loneliness 😂😂
Haha the failed AirPower unit just sitting on the desk is icing on the cake
500 bucks for apple care seems like a compete ripoff if you still need to pay 300 on top of it for the front plastic/glass replacement, what a racket apple is running...
Plenty of VR/AR use USB C on Portable Devices
After several days of babying, mine, this is the hardest video I’ve ever watched.
My heart skips when that razor almost sliced you up a few times lol
10:03 My favorite type of display animated cup display
Looks like saved 3500 dollars
Brutal
If you check the accessibility settings on the device, they actually give a lot of options for navigation/control — including the ability to take actions on the device using different sounds
I love how Zach is incredibly busy and a very big YouTuber, yet he still takes some time out of his day to read comments.
this was so much more satisfying than any phone
He didn’t use the pull tabs 🥺
hey
i only brazillian watch this?? jerry i love yours videos
The madman did it. Just waiting on a cybertruck destruction video now
I don't know yet what is this video about, but I know this is going to be viral.
1:11 i don't know about the love part, but i dont think its a lie about the 1000 grandma part
It’s to expensive I can’t afford it
lol imagine if this a ASMR video with all that noise hahaha
Doesn't even attempt to make it salvage or repairable
This is a very interesting & expensive video for sure!
$3500 for plastic garbage.
😂the ending
“From the love of a 1000 grammas”
No wonder the damn thing comes with a massive microfiber cloth. Sadly, it won't remove scratches from a level 3 or deeper grooves from a level 4...
Still the best looking vr tho
It’s hard to believe you destroyed it before an actual review of the experience
If I watch MKBH alone I’ll want to buy it, bro makes it look so cool. But if I watch your video it brings me back to reality. It’s not worth it.
Im not a apple fan. Yet this hurt my heart watching him destroy this
Is it water proof or water resistant? I wanna use it on the tub 🛀 😂
DAMN
I wonder how much it is.
Incredible invasive investigative work as always! The sound of the Vision Pro carcass chunks hitting the floor during the sponsored bit was the icing on the cake. Legit surprised about the plastic. The innards look dope even if it's basically non-repairable.
Expensive ouch.
i would love to see how you eat crab legs for some reason
Do your thing screen protector makers!
I do NOT wanna be the guy who has to get a repaste done on this in a few years, holy butts
Awesome! Can’t wait to see the reassembly video!
Once this launched did people forget the Q3 exists? Cause from what I have seen the Q3 beats this in every actual vr metric. Also, while you're burning that head strap I hope you had a facemask on cause that was probably toxic fumes coming off of it.
Makes a lot of waste from someone who drives an electric car, and Someone is pro less waste.
Uh oh
WHAT this guys burning a thousand grandmas
This video broke my heart 🙂👍🏻
Neatly trimmed nails.
Congratulation, You just destroy 3500 dollars toy.
Wow killer review! That is awesome to see the internals.
Probably the only Apple Vision Scratch Test we will ever see
Tears of Loneliness, hello my old friend.
Not sure if anyone remembers this, but Zack did a durability test of the Nexus 6P 8 years ago, and it epically failed. Everyone was up in arms over it.  Something interesting that happened in the video was that he did a scratch test all the way to level 9, and right after he tapped the screen, a crack ran through it. What Zack said at 9:06 must be an explanation for that.
Ngl this was hard to watch😢😂
I watched this just after watching iFixit's tear down. The contrast of between them is so awesome :D
I don’t think you can return it now, I’m pretty sure you just voided the warranty!!   I’m actually surprised that you went that far with it and not just going far enough that you could put it back together and still use it. I know, I know, I should have known better…
No mohs scale on the lenses?
So Apple calls Plastic,  laminated glass? Sounds like false advertising.
I can't wait to see how long it takes Anker to come out with a much better battery.
Finally Gone Level 3 😀
There is a thin plastic film over the glass. Look at prg and ifix it
“Subconsciously ducked” is enough for me to peak my interest in this tech 😂
I just don’t know how to feel about this ,this was so wrong but couldn’t look away burning money 💰 crazy
Bro why didn’t you turn on the battery? I’m so sad.
How does it connect to tha internet?
Yall can't see that readyPlayerOne is right around the corner. Yay extreme poverty for everyone but at least you can live in the oasis
You underestimate the chronic fomo apple fanboys have
Take this pile of rubble into the Apple Store and tell them you accidentally dropped it.😂😂😂
My God! Starving children in Canada could have eaten that apple…
Love the apple destruction.
Sin piedad …
lmfao u cut ur thumb
why would you use a knife to open the box, there is a tab to open it. It was painful to watch
THIS HURTS BUT I LOVE THE CONTENT AAHHH
Give apple until apple vision 2 and when they figure out this product isn’t worth 3500, the prices will fall
goosebumpssss
why didnt you do this with  cybertruck?
I would like to see a teardown of the knit headband I found it more interesting then Vision Pro when it was announced
What a time to be alive
watching this on a vision pro is wild
8:08✌🏻 😂✌🏻
tears of loneliness? 🤣🤣
duct tape, you need duct tape to put it back in operating condition.
I can't stop laughing at the line "feels like it's been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas". XD XD XD here 1:16
dis shit is too expensive for me to walk everywhere with
This.Just.Hurt!!!!!!
Agent 47 learning new tech
the front glass has a plastic film on it to give the more 3d effect, still that thing will scratch easy
Use a USB C EXT cable for battery
This was painful, nice work
idk why i stumbled on this channel, but i have to mute the audio when he scratches stuff, or it makes me really uncomfortable.
Feel the power of level 9!
What happens to all the products he scratches after he finished?
Alright. Now put it back together 😂
Shit I need to make sure not to bring my metal knife near the lenses
So satisfying
dang so ig i can't use a knife to clean dust off my apple vision pro :(
watching you destroy it is heart breaking
Whyyyyy
Ugh, I’ve been saving for months….and he just destroys one!
Tear of Loneliness 😂 😂
Its funny i almost blow my phone to distinguish the fire during the burn test😅
scratches at a level 7 with deeper grooves at a level 8 then scratches at a level 3 with deeper grooves at a level 4, what a wild week
You liked it because it doesn't mess your hair...
2 hours, the exact battery life... 😞
Only 3000 mAh in a very large battery while my cell phone has 5000 mAh and is much smaller and lighter.
4000 bands is plastic and its not on my credit card  😂
We do have scheduled texted messages
So painful to watch
i just cringe so much watching this
Why isn't it made of titanium
Gonna need a screen protector for it lol
esos 3,500 los recupera con éste video en par de horas 😂
I imagine this is what an autopsy on Johnny 5 would look like.
And this is how a Dbrand skin is being made.
Blud really lost $3500 just for content 😭 (i know he’ll make that in less than an hour)
Tears of loneliness 5:53 😭
i was waiting for this video but feel guilty at the same time😂cuz is not cheap haha
Definitely cut the antenna cable when you took off the glass
The Apple care math tho...🤣😂
Apple is stuck in 2006 (even the first iPhone used glass)
I was exciting and scared at the same time watching this video.
Its shite compared to pico4
Everyone like this comment gets I’ll do one push-up I will make a video on it because I am a YouTuber.
ohh God that herts...
In an alternate universe rich me would have wanted to buy these, right up until I saw the interior lenses are plastic and scratch easily. What was Apple thinking?!!
i see pending sales being canceled in real time as this video is being watched lol. As Casey Neistat would say, this is the "worst version ever made" as there will be major improvements down the road of all the things that was clearly a shock in this video. haha
platics in 2024. wtf apple
Whyyyyyyyy
"wrist twist" I see what you did there
Hello mr Jerry Rig May I have the vision pro and repair it to use it
Skynet is coming and when the T800s come, they are coming for you first Zach. 🤣🤣🤣
I smell #1 trending
i think they need to make this accessible for blind people as well. rather unfortunate my community gets forgotten about so often
11:30 They have eye function, if you have a lazy eye, they also have specific eye function, look at something and blink to click
Its mock up video 🤣
Every like this comment gets, I’ll do you one push-up I’ll make a video on it since I’m a YouTuber
The waiting is finally over
Apple Vision Pro and TechImma1st
It's painful to watch. hahaha
Lol did not expect this
3:00 No pun intended 😂
The inside of the lenses are plastic? PLASTIC? lol. wtf
Creo que ya no me agrada este sujeto
Love this video
Only Apple sells an overpriced item that only it's Isheeps buy😂😂😂😅
thank you for clarifying the voltage on the battery! I've seen a lot of people confused over the low amp hours.
this thing does not deserve to be more than 500
Oh Jerry Jerry apple is angry with you because you destroyed their crown jewel 🤔🤔🤔
Plastic.....for 4 grand. No thankyou.
I bought the eye protection. Now I've to buy a wet suit and a O2 cylinder 🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
We all know what Zach is known for, but it still hurt watching him destroy $3500 😔
Painfully satisfying...
Well, that was a brutal tear down  😳
Damn this video was destruction 😂
YOU ARE A MONSTER!!! :v
This thing has a target audience of like 4 people (and they're all tech youtubers)
That was so stressed video what I ever seen
This one was painful to watch
Honestly, this is the right decision, Glass would be very heavy and it would shatter and it would probably scratch anyway… Sometimes the more durable tough thing is something thats less hard.
That was the most satisfying destruction of a $3500 device ever. I do believe this may very well be Apple's waterloo device
He is breaking one kidney of others 😢
you monster
I was afraid of this one. 😬 Painful to watch but informative
The one we have all been waiting for
Hard watch as usual, Jerry! 🔥🔥😩
He has a great sense of humour....no one can beat him ❤
That's a beautiful piece of work..
If i saw someone wearing these I'm 99% sure they'd be drinking a bud light out of a straw and eating a $19 piece of avocado toast
impressive how much tech is inside the vision pro
Laminated glass but reality hardened plastic.... This is why i love to stay away from Apple product...  Big scammers....
Anker products were cooler than the Goggles😅
Danm you killed this things Jerry 😅😂
Is this available to the commoners yet, or did Apple send you one thinking you wouldn’t rig the shit out of it?
👍
11:11 interesting, I was thinking how they managed to avoid light passing throught the interface.
You can replace the crown  with accessibilities custom  shortcuts/(this isn't the right wording but you can google it to finde)
Banger
I am thrilled to see the next generations
114k views in 50 minutes is crazy. G.O.A.T
Can you give this away? I need one even if it’s beat
Im waiting for that eye glasses place visionpro sues apple for the name
Scratched plastic lenses are a sure thing in use, 3500 dollars for a throw away, don't think so.
Damn Apple be selling cheap glasses since iPhone 15 Pro came out. If they continue doing this shit, I'll probably stop buying anything from them
“Feels like it was knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas” -Jerry 2024
I would absolutely love to be a fly on the wall while the product team at Apple watches this. I imagine it would be an entertaining mix of horror and appreciation.
Piece of plastic cover costing $800. It's like Apple put zero thought into keeping the price low. At least now I know the $3500 is just an apple tax and other headsets will be able to achieve the same thing at a significantly lower price.
Alteast it aint titanium 😅😅
Dude this guy is awesome
Your teardown of this thing is pure anarchy 😂
Tbh, there are visible scratches at level 2 lol
I don't care how great a product Apple produces, they're going to have to pry my money from my cold, dead hands before I ever willimgly hand a cent to them. Maybe if they jump onto the right to repair movement and try to reverse some of those anti-consumer decisions they love so damned much, I'll change my mind. On principle though, the company can rot screaming in hell.
apple definetly afford to put front display in glass not with plastic😢
I enjoy trying to learn how to fix stuff... but I sure want to put it back together and see if it works. Apple has never made it easy for DIY repairs.
there is dwell control so you don't have to use the finger tap. also switch control so Bluetooth switches can be paired and used with any body part you can use to push a switch.. including the blow tube kinds. Personally with EDS the track pad control is most accessible for me... but the unit itself is a little heavy for my neck.
The fact that we reached this level of technology as humans is amazing, but is there any chance we can go back now? i dont like where this is going
Why does the “recycled yarn” look suspiciously like plastic LMFAO
This one felt extra rough to watch- well done!
5:45 “tears of loneliness” 🤣💀
you missed the extra wide boi lightning like connectors keeping the speakers and head straps plugged in!
I still wonder why apple didn't ban this guy's address
this video is pain
It's nice even at 3500 bucks...but I'm wait a generation or 2 same thing I did with the galaxy fold.
You should put apple care to the test, by sending this unit over.
My man wrecked the living shit outta this😂
for some unknown reason i can smell the smoke
This apple has never been more pathetic. Designed to make you pay as much as possible for the repair or device. E.g. powerbank, repair.
Anyone with a meta quest 3 or quest pro, not to worry, you’re crushing this Apple trash 😂
Hold up one second I can’t say I’ve ever dropped a laptop or my PC gear, the index and the oculus are comparable here why haven’t you reviewed them? Is this just an apple hate boner you got going? Or are you starting to branch out beyond smartphones ? I thought you would when you broke an iPad but not a galaxy tab…..
Why not tear down the battery?
That scratching gave me goosebumps every time😭
Pffff Apple can keep that. Ain’t nobody paying $3,500+ and AppleCare , there be another version next year 😂
"Tears of loneliness......"      Shots fired
,😮😅
American tech loves their prices and subscriptions...
I wonder if Apple is going to take out a copyright on the lab goggles look
We made it.
I love how Zack proceeds to set on fire what is probably the most desirable consumer electronics product available right now!😂😂😂 He was beating that thing like it owed him money!😂😂😂 I’m sure he couldn’t go easy on this one as he probably had a line of people hitting him up for the spoils before his “test”.
Amazing piece of technology but having zero way to get to fully underneath the boards from the front or back is painful. Considering the copious amounts of thermal paste it needs, imagine in 3, 4, or 5 years from now when it dries up and the device overheats and can't stay on. It's e-waste now.
So satisfying 😍
SHEER GIRTH
this was just as satisfying as it was painful to watch.
Nahhh this man didn’t 😂😂
mmmm, thermal paste, my favorite
What a piece of junk $3500 lol
Ah the love of 1000 grandma's lit on fire 🔥
was not expecting this, but hey I am all here for it!
Appel hah 🍺
Imagine how much better they could've made this if they didn't waste time and space on the goofy ass eye display
Bro just destroyed 3.5k 😢
It felt so wrong watching him scratch the lenses 💀
BRO HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU AFFORD TO DO THIS, i literally cried the whole time
This is just a DESTROYING A VISHIN PRO
You should upload your videos in HDR, that's the ultimate video quality flex that those are missing.. I know there's a whole color science degree to have to properly master a HDR video, but that'd be SICK
Jerry: I would like to use apple care.. Apple agent: what happened? Jerry: My normal use.
Yeah, laminate is a good thing for protection. Lots of materials burn easily! I think they are still easily worth the $3500 asking price. Many people are looking to buy them.
kazhinja janmathil ento valiya papam cheytha 'Apple Vision Pro' aanu ith, RIP
The amount of thermalpaste was ridiculous.
Bro ruined a 3,000 dollar apple vision pro😂😂😂😂😂
its a mind blowing piece of engineering, of course it's not perfect but it's awesome
Does this hurt the headset?
Gaaah! This hurts to watch at points. I wince at every audible scratch.
Mkbhd miss out the cable... He said it's not removable 😊
That was the biggest dunk of all time, I will be buying one of those Anker power banks for the line "that didn't come in the box". Unexpected ad that worked perfectly
Accessibility is certainly important. The Apple Vision Pro failed to pass the Closed-fist test from ADA
I figured that because this was a "Pro" model, that they would make a cheaper non-pro variant down the road once the technology gets better and refined, and cheaper to make. Turns out Apple just decided to call it pro just because, and make it cheap already. Sick.
Wow..
Bro' that carving and cutting through of that slick plastic lens cover with the razor knife toward the direction of your thumb is downright eerie. Perhaps a Dremel with a rotary cutting blade would be safer.
I saw no other reviewer mention this, now the scratch test came in real handy!! This must explain why it performed so well in a drop test I watched.
Wait until Apple releases a bigger battery pack once enough customers are hooked
Don't encourage this nonsense.   I will not interact with anyone wearing one of these.
10:03
It hurts watching this shm lol
I’m guessing iFixIt will rate this a 1/10 for repairability.
I have a prescription glasses and Apple's website asks for more money to install those lenses. It would be cool if the system was able to adjust to your vision automatically and i think it is possible.
This is the greatest Apple Vision Pro video out right now!
S24u: scratches at level 7  with deeper groove at level 8 -> wow!finally  Vision pro: scratches at level 3  with deeper groove at level 4 -> wow! Btw why no reviewer mention this?
this one really hurt
You have to be a special kind of person to stomach destroying $3500 worth of equipment
This is definition of pain
3 grand for a VR headset I'll pass
What happened to your thumb half way through the video 😂😂
Been waiting for this video!
10:05😹😹
I dont have money to buy it yet.. (still paying for my mbp 16 😂) nice to see a teardown of a very expensive device
Are you gonna keep using this one after the test?
So, Vision 'Pro'..  Does this imply there will be a Vision 'Dilettante' or Vision 'Amateur'?
bro that lightning cable is a chonky boy
Thank God I sub to you I was about to buy this but to me easily scratch able displays are a no go even if it's a good phone
This is the video the whole world has been waiting for!!!
If you are into testing VR headsets now, could you test the PSVR2 in comparison?
What do you do with the hardware inside of the Vision Pro which didn’t get damaged such as the M2 chip? It’s very valuable so surely you keep it or sell it etc?
You're going straight to tech jail for this.
Love of a thousand grandmas😅😅😅
You could’ve removed the white speaker bands with your Sim card tool. there’s a hole in the metal base
Leave it to Jerry to absolutely mutilate the Apple Vision Pro...LMAO
Oops😮
I almost throw up seeing somebody destroying such a high price product without doing any usefull user output such as: drop tests, heat tests, vibrations tests etc... What's the point of these video's. I'm just trying to understand the point of this beside ifix it or any actual useful output.
Very cool piece of tech... but the price is absolutely stupid. Obviously, this isn't intended for a wide audience.
Great Rip Zach .. Good advice to Apple with the wrist . Apple engineers should ask you for advice , For a Price ... Watch them use wrist addition . Makes sense , good job
moral of the story this was made cheap
12:30 big sponsor, they make gud sht
Apple never fails price its products sensibly.
OMG, just throw your $3k+ in the fire, skip waiting for shipping. Typical overpriced Apple product, I'll never buy.
This was both brutal and instructive. I mean, there are so many unnecessary pieces. This is clearly over-engineered. We don't need the fake eyes, or the automated interpupillary distance measuring.
this is one of those tear downs that actually hurts...
12:45 404 Jackery not found
emptied my tear ducts watching this * RIP Vision Pro *
And people say Apple doesn't innovate.
iphones do have scheduled text messages?
What we’ve been all waiting for
আকাঙ্ক্ষা
This is oddly satisfying...
this man loves scratch things
Goes to show how much money these youtubers are making and it's gross. Breaking a $5k vision pro so you can make more money.
🤮 OmG Its so sad, pretty, sad too. But its apple so no harm done.
OMG JERRYRIG IS CRAZY !!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looking forward for the reassembling video! 😂
That price is outrageous in these times no thanks
The Boy Scout inside me is screaming while you cut towards yourself. be safe my guy.
35k plastic
I love this. but my broke wallet started to cry as he scraped up the linticular display
Phone repair guru opened up the device as well. Please support him.
thank you for convincing me that i shouldn't buy it, I just can't get past the plastic lenses
I actually $hed $ome Tear$ watching thi$ Video.. lol
Thumbs up if you want to see Jerry walk in to a apple store and attempt to get it serviced under apple care 😂
After the teardown, all that's needed is a metal helmet, and instantly, you're recreating a cosplay of the one and only...Robocop 😅
People will hate you for this but I still love you
That recycled wool looks awefully like polyester when burnt.. (wool is naturally fire retardant)
" tears of loneliness".... epic...
Appreciate the sacrifice to get this video posted, but had to hit the eject button due to the fingernail on a chalkboard with the scratching.
dinner and Jerry make a great night
XBOX Kinect for the VR.  Late to the party, cameras over comfy more capable controllers, overpriced to hell and makes you look equally ridiculous to outside observers.
I was wondering if you would do this one.
Wait, the charger doesn't come in the box?
Imagine spending all that money on a device and you can't even leave your vision pros on your couch. One of your kids comes with a toy kitchen spoon and scratches the glass, your pet cat or the keys in your pocket. 🙄💭💸💸💸
Great review one of the best I have seen so far
i can see Zack was pretty gentle with his vision pro 😂😂
Bro just casually dissected the device
Welcome to 2024
So you didn’t get the rest of the scuba diving gear? I suppose?
I never even knew I had anxiety until I watched this video.
Only thing I took from this is Iphone doesnt have scheduled messages
Dang, Zach will take anything apart.....and thank you!
Genius channel!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Finally someone using the Vision Pro correctly
I loved the Ready Player One (Oasis) reference at the end.
im 13 (turning 13 feb 28th!) and im waiting for oculus to copy off this so i can test out the features  cuz im broke 4k like like a new car for us so if i wait for oculus to rip theses features i wont have to pay 4k
“Knitted with the love of 1000 grandmas” 😂
I find it hilarious how gruff you were with this knowing you were never going to get it back together
Jerry's commitment is as always much appreciated. Testing everything no matter the price tag is a sacrifice that really does benefit the greater good.
I mean, if it was glass it’d probably be heavier and less comfortable to wear too so… 🤷‍♂️
I wonder what genius decided to put the laminate layer on the outside
You destroyed a $3500 product. How do you manage to sleep peacefully at night? 😭😭😭
Not hard to believe Apple charges 800 dollars to replace the glass
RIP Vision Pro.
i wouldve liked to see a drop test actually
Wonder if it still works...
I felt that scratching in my nether regions
hell yea
0:39 Robocop 😂😂👌
WOW!   OK.   So I just now had to run out of the Apple Store after doing a demo of the new Apple Vision Pro! I knew that if I spent another minute in that store my pocketbook would be A LOT lighter right now!  What an Amazing, Phenomenal, Incredible experience it was!  Don’t pay attention to what you hear others say about it! Don’t think you know what the experience is like because you, like I had, watched YouTubers review it!  You HAVE to try this thing out for yourself!  WOW!
I wonder what it is like to type on my new phone
Your desk is slowly turning into AvE's desk.
READY PLAYER ONE, reference at the end there. Very nice.
This is the most painful to watch video I've seen in a while.  Is this what this guy does to things? OMG
3500$ more like 1500$
Wow, a level 3 scratch. Haven't seen those in awhile.
i wish i had enough money to do stupid bullshit like this lol
"mi patience is immeasurable" -Continues stabbing the device
Every scatch and burn you made felt it was done to my heart.😢Too expensive to see it done like that
$3500 only inside and not outside stuff, impressive apple! Still not gonna buy it tho
🫡🫡🫡❤
Dang I was not expecting it to scratch that easily, now I know to be extra careful with this thing. Good thing I bought zeiss single use moistened wipes to clean this thing
I think that the outside screen is a mistake. It doesn't work very well and requires all kinds of filters that require this laminated glass, instead of more resistant glass or mostly metal exterior.
"the rubber's probably there to help keep moisture, make-up, sweat, and tears of loneliness from entering into the motorized internals" 🤣 jeez dude
"and tears of loneliness" I think man just spoke for all of us so we didn't have to
This must the most complex consumer product ever shipped 😳 Great engineering!
Watching from my overpriced Apple Vision Pro!😂😂
apple and their proprietary connectors...that really makes me mad.
Hard to watch...like $3500.....going down the drain!
Glass wouldve made that thing even more front heavy than it already is.
You just can’t compete with the love of a 1000 grandmas 😂
Loved the Oasis reference! Amazing books
There goes $3500
These videos are always pretty fun but the way this man handles a blade stresses me out
Who needs band-aids when u have electrical tape? 😂
they make it to easily scrathes because they gonna make apple vision pro 2 or max ver. with stronger glass after this but anything inside just the same thing like they always do.
For $3,500 you get, scratches at a level 3 and deeper grooves at a level 4.
the noise at 4:17 made me physically recoil, god that is horrible
Quest 2: Im about to ruin this whole Headset's career
Junk
Wow! $3500 plastic!
The exact video I’ve been waiting for since the ski goggles released 😂🙌🏼
It's Apple Vision Plastic bro. Not Pro.
I would've wanted that avp :(
amazing thing is that it still works after teardown judging by the zach hand movement in the end of the video
crack that battery open too.
13:13 happy to see the custom gold rescued Apple Watch S4 again ☝️
FYI you can totally schedule texts with Shortcuts
In all fairness when it’s not on you, keep the cover on. When it’s on you I think your skin scratches at a level 1 so the Vision Pro is probably more durable than your face. I think they use plastic coatings to ensure the glass doesn’t shatter easily, is not dangerous, and survives being dropped from head height. Someone tested it and it only broke after dropping it from 10-12 feet onto hard wood face first. Also for nearly $4k I hope people are more careful with it than their phones.
this thing somehow feels very high tech while also obviously being a first generation of a product. it doesn't reach the potential it promises. its really cool but a bit unrefined.
This hurt
dame thought you were going to put it back together... shame
😫
3500$ unrepairable scam!
MacGyver strikes again
😬
I am sorry, but for $3,500, we expect higher quality, and not...plastic and 2 hour battery lifef
Everyone: $3500 piece of Tech lets go check out the software and handle with care. Zach: Hey wanna see the insides?
1:17 But instead it's with the soul of a 1000 children from china
Thank you for the giveway jerry.. much love
This is the most useless waste of money ever
How the F is anyone affording it
Will DBRAND make protective cover for the very scratchable surface of the "lense" outside and inside?
Dude’s been apple’s terror since he broke that iPhone 15! 😂
watching this is causing me physical pain
Now put it back together
Zach, When are you going to tell Anker to take a hike? They are a 🗑️ company and they lie. Jackery or bust.
imagine paying 3k when you can see reality just by opening your eyes
3 mins in dude forgot what to film Lmao, but yeah this headset sucks
very crap material of the lents and expensive i guess better wait to other brand to copy this crap and improve
Pass me that Vision Pro before you destroy it bro 💀
bro is Jeff bezos
"Tears of loneliness" - I genuinely lol'd
🤣🤣🤣
Well that explains that. Looking forward to the next version.
Goin to have to get apple care for this lol
Jerry literally rigged everything!
It's fits u so well, your a real future man, must see your persona!!
i dont know why i was physically angered and triggered by his scratching and destruction of this fine product.
You would think it was sown by a bunch of grandmas but nope, it’s children lol
Ive waited all day long to see Zach do a durability test on a completely new Apple product
Those scratches at level 3 were some of the most painful things I’ve seen in a while
Daaaaaamn dude. Spend 3500 bucks on something you know is gunna be hell to repair, and it's literally cheap plastic, _and_ its super uncomfortable to wear? That suuuuuucks.
this one hurt to watch ong
4:56 Crocodile Aligator
Engineers: *audibly swallow deepest fears*
Man I know it's what he does but $3500 just to destroy it is insane.
The Vision Pro is like a McLaren, cool but a nightmare to fix.
Don't lie, every single one of you was waiting impatiently for this one video on the vision pro
PAIN!
Aren't we going to teardown the battery bank to see what's inside?!
To destroy 3.500 bucks like this is crazy
I am beyond floored by the fact that the solo knit band isn't flame retardant. Is the dual loop band??
You forgot to show that the rubber side pieces can also be removed with a sim tool.
was waiting for this
Great comment about improving for accesibility. I will say, on the other hand, that moving the full mac to ARM was a mayor undertanking, it disripted the PC industry and the software complexity can't be forgoten.   Microsoft toke  years trying to have an somehow stable software platform. Some people will say they are still strugling.
This video lets the viewer realize how poor one is
Bro it's hurtful to watch you destroying 3500$ when we all know that people are starving and others are working very hard only to survive !
Its an awesome piece of engineering
Savage
❤
this video will break the record of jerry rig :D
Best review of the apple vision pro. whos waiting for v2?
I wasn’t old enough to remember how alien and innovative the first iPhone was when it came out, but seeing the Apple Vision Pro it’s insane seeing such a huge leap in tech and incredibly impressive innovation. It’s quite exciting and I can’t wait for the future of the Apple Vision product line !!
it really hurts me to see 3500$ tech get destroyed
Makes me wonder how much money they make from selling one unit
5:49 tears of loneliness 😅
This is the same durability level as the first gen Samsung Fold. I hope people have their eyes opened with this video.
With this much damage can you still send for AppleCare?
What a waste of money. Glad you made me want it less! You could buy 3 Oculus headsets for the price of one glass cover on this apple thing.
The Oasis....good throwback to Ready Player One MR Rig
Welcome to new episode of scratch at level 6 and deeper grove at level 7
$3000 and can’t afford the glass??!
The goggle part being plastic is super disappointing tbh, im expecting glass and metal for 3.5 racks, not scratches at lvl 3 with deeper grooves at a lvl 4
like always, I felt much pain when watching this...good pain 😏
damn, is this the most expensive durability test yet?
Yeah. This is what 8M subscriber make from a human being. Congratulation.
How will tv licensing work on this for my fellow UK people.
Teardown No one wanted, but needed !!
I wonder about the faces of the team that produced this right now. Now I can go back to sleep. Everything on Zack's desk is a tool. The wrist twist suggestion is brilliant.
It hurts
Those hands are in need of some love <3
For some reason this one hurt a bit more.
Do meta quest 3 tear down
soothing voice really goes well together with this violent teardown lol
Thank you for this wonderful entertainment. I love seeing a $3500 VR headset ripped apart and examined in such detail. You're my hero.
your little bit about accessibility was completely pointless, people who have lost fingers have much bigger things to worry about than being able to operate an apple product
I came for the destruction lolol and tiktok sucks DONT think your apple care will cover that damage Zach ;)
$3500 for this?  😅
This video is especially traumatic, poor ski goggles ;_;
added plastic over the lenses and front to make more money.
Cant wait for the Android version
X bought me here
I think jerry was most impressed by the headband made with the recycled yarn with the  power of grandma cuddles.
Stop pincing the air
If you don’t like it just try give it to me 😊😊
“Tears of loneliness” is maddd ☠️☠️☠️
You saved my life!!!! My imaginary vision pro almost got destroyed but thanks to this video, I can properly look at the sky!!!!
Lets Go!!!
bro its so much money
theyre apple, not microsoft.  they've never really catered towards disabled people and they likely never will.  just like they've never really made repair ability a remote priority.  it cuts into their profits, just ask rossmann.
Why Jerry Rig Everything, you should have leave this device and be Jerry love everything
And Poof 400 dollars  gone  right infront of me
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD  Thank you for destroying the product and once again proving apple always charges a premium for technology that others will do better in less time. Guarantee we see something similar to this (but outside the normal realm of VR like an oculus or a Vive/etc.) in the near future with sapphire glass and with removable/replaceable glass/acrylic parts.   Either way, this was both harmful to my psyche as a tech lover, but also amazing at the same time from watching another apple product destroyed and proving their value just isn't there compared to the cost. I'll wait for whatever comes next for sure.   Thanks for the honest review and destruction p*rn
5:47 Tears of loneliness 💀💀😭
I thought he didn’t dare to do durability test on MacBooks because they were too expensive, but this is almost as expensive as a MacBook well as expensive as a base model at least😂
Oddly satisfying and heart wrenching at the same time.
I feel early 😊
Anyone see that guy driving his tesla with this apple headset on? Idiocracy is real 😢  I do love these teardowns. 😊
hi. looking for ifixit disassembly guide. is this it?
I bought 6 of these, one for me, the wife, and each of the kids. I can't wait to not have to interact with them
MY NON-EXISISTENT WALLET IS CRYING 💀
this is the whistlindiesel of tech reviews.
If you came from X like this
Literally looked “JerryRigEverything apple pro tear down” up 4 times today. So happy its posted now
So cool to see the internals of the Vision Pro
800 bucks for the easiest part to ruin, apple moment. what a joke
This was hard to watch
Hope they’ll let you return it
I stopped watching this when you butned the fabric head band…this is just a witch hunt looking for any way the trash an apple product… good lick to you sir
Now, is it reasonable that they put a layer of plastic in front of the glass in order to sell you spare parts, because if they did not do so with a removable battery, you may not have to repair it for a long period of time. Is this a scam?     We are talking about the apple product. This means that even if future generations are released, the price has not decreased, but rather has remained at its price in the first place. I am waiting for the Chinese companies to enter into this so that competition increases and prices gradually decrease.
"love of a thousand grandmas", what a great line!
Bruh
I have a high Level spinal injury (c6) and can't move my fingers so yea a wrist flic would be good as I'd love one of these but unfortunately I'm not able to use it,  majorly gutted 😢😢
what a legend
Him destroying a 3500 dollar gadget hurts my heart 😂😂
I really don't like the statement that iPhone doesn't have scheduled messages. It all falls into your (and mine) problem category of having to do more taps/clicks to do anything on an iPhone. Because you can easily go into Shortcuts and create an automation that sends a message at certain time of the day. Sure, it's incredibly badly designed by Apple, should be inside of Messages app like it is on Androids, but saying that iPhone doesn't have scheduled messages feels false to me.   I'm also shocked that exterior of vision pro is plastic. Doesn't change anything for me tho, never gonna buy it anyway :D
Yes yes yes yes yes
That was HARD $$$$ to watch
Usb c cost an additional 300$
Come on, you were expecting something more resistant from Apple of all companies????
How much weight of each component?
I am getting goosebumbs when hearing the scratching sounds.
Apple does have scheduled text messages but it’s through Shortcuts.
“Tears of loneliness” lmao
Man with all the plastic I don't understand how that thing is as heavy as it is
Never expected that cheap plastic 😭
2016
Bracing myself for the words: “scratches at level 5 with deeper grooves at level 6” 💀😭
Hiii
Did you bought 2 units?
This is WILD. These are gonna look cheap in a few months. :$
Cool video.
If you claim it’s not meant to be repaired then you haven’t watched ifixit’s actual teardown 😅
I think the biggest hurdle of accessibility right now is the price. 😬
This viedo is torturing me 😖
So it's the same "glass" Samsung uses on their flex phones... i guess big tech theses days  forgot whats glass and trying to reinvent it uh?
not hating but not everything in this world has to able for other as well if ya catch my drift
You think this headset still works?
for the love of god use chapters for the metal scraping so we can skip over it
i dont mind jerry destroing phones at all, but this broked my heart
This man going to single handily make Apple put schedule text on their shit. Start a partition I’ll sign.
“The Yapple Vision Pro”
Oh my god, you did it!!! I just commented on MKBHD’s video wondering if you’d spend $3500 to do a durability test and by god you did it!!
Tare into the battery pack 😊
3:21 "Glass" well, that Can accurately describe plastic under specific scientific usages.... But not any common usages. So that's Marketing just looking for trouble.  Probably also because Every face PC or face display has failed; so this is a high risk project. 3d formed glass is difficult, costly & has a high failure rate in production.  You Might see it on gen 2, assuming this is wildly successful.
The scratch test on this one was extra hard to watch
While I'm glad that this device is giving more awareness to VR to people who didn't pay attention to it before, it does hurt to see people attribute normal already existing VR features to Apple themselves.
Oh no Jerry, its 4k here in aus.
@louisrossmann @6:55
Polishing gun sales will go up exponentially
Yeahh this looks cool, but I think based on Apple's history I'm going to wait for the Vision Pro 2 or 3 in 2025 or 2026. Maybe by then there will have been a long overdue class action lawsuit too.
Ijustine is dead?
Are you telling me I should not have bought 3 OF THEM ON THE RELEASE  DAY FIR MY BROTHERS AND FOR MYSELF
The destruction we’ve all been waiting for!
800 fir a plastic laminate 😂 Apple know what they doing
Best review of the Vision Pro, so far...
why not make the aluminum part plastic and make the plastic lens glass? I'm assuming it was done in part do to the weight issue, no?
man that was hard to watch
the ending lol
This really hurt to watch as this is a really expensive Apple product and I’m an Apple fanboy! I am thinking about purchasing but can’t understand why the $200 puff case is so puffy.
This video is going Viral for various reasons and will be watched even decades later Could you Pin my comment Zack, for the future
Great vid
I think it's better to bring back Google Glass. 🤣
Can't believe Jerry spent over 3k on these.
want to see a dbrand skin for this thing
I just hate when my VR goggles catch on fire. Thanks for showing us what happens so we know to avoid burning ours.
The construction of this is basically the same as a meta quest and its 10x the price
The video we have been waiting for 🎉🎉🎉
too hurt to watch lol Thanks for the content Jerry!
8:41 it is no mystery how he got that band aid 😂
When you were a kid I wonder how far you made it into Christmas day before you were grounded.
1:17 the irony is it was 1000 children.
Knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas 😂
It’s insane how those tiny displays can replicate a massive Netflix tv screen while seemingly being in the middle of Grand Canyon.
I was waiting for this video 🤣
Damn😬😬😬😬
holy shit what are you doing to that poor headset
I understood the "Ready Player One" reference
It's going to be #1 on trending in a couple hrs. Watch
Just cannot believe they didn't make the lenses and exterior tougher against scratches. My biggest fear is purchasing this only to have Apple release a new one within the next two years. Fuck that
Someone’s dream is another one’s toy 😢
Liked the Ready Player One reference.
I am Apple Vision Pro in this plastic world, I am made of plastic, & it's fantastic!
nooooooooooooooo
is a teardown possible? (i mean a sticker)
Most expensive test yet?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Charging $3500 for fragile materials is something else.
There is a thin layer of plastic that can be potentially removed.
no way apple made one more overpriced toy!
Only Apple would treat its customers to a headband made of napalm.
Oh no you didn't!
Incredible! 😂
uh oh
so many teardown already posted on youtube but this is the only channel i am waiting
All this time, I thought that the materials would be durable because of the price.
There should definitely be more gestures that don't make you look so sus.
"Time will come to do what I do" lmao! Love it!
Omg 😳 no. dear God no 😢
Early!1!1111
epic end.
Nice Ready Player One reference
This was painful to watch. I cannot believe that at that price it doesn't have scratch resistant glass or lenses!!! I would love one of these but I even if I could justify buying one I wouldn't because of the non scratch resistance.
The solo strap is weird. Everyone says how well engineered it is, but anyone that is into VR would tell you that is a stupid design since your face and hair still have to support the headset. I guess it looks good in pictures though...
It….   Beginsssss……
I dont know. I think that wrist twist motion might impede…. “other” possible use cases 😂
There goes my 6 mnth salary😭
Best review of the Vision Pro on YouTube!! Love the commentary!! Can’t wait till I get 2 of my Vision Pros!!
I’ve been waiting for this since the Vision Pro came out😎✨
as someone who doesn’t have finger function Zach is completely right that the accessibility on this device could be way better I’m in love with it but worry that if I buy one it would be basically unusable for me unless they develop something like the way to do it with your wrist
Expensive Test.
I swear a big majority of Apple's marketing is that if they make something this expensive, you can be the cool guy at the office who spent $3500 on the most gimmicky VR headset on the market. The durability, longevity, and repair options are so incredibly laughable that I'd be hard pressed to contemplate the purchase at $350. It's an awesome idea however unfortunately most of the tech behind it is just software based. I wouldn't be surprised if Meta makes a similar design for $700 or so in the next few years.
3500$ = plastic lenses.....just dont buy it..
Charging 800usd for a plastic cover 💀
Smashing apple vision pro
I liked my own comment
When it came to lenses, felt like y r scratching heart 🥲🥲
I can’t believe it’s made out of plastic that’s ridiculous
I can’t watch the whole video. It’s too painful. Sorry mate. 😢
I feel like I just watched someone vivisect their own pet with a boxcutter.
WOW.. this is going to fail on the scrating in no time. THAT is a death nail for a $3500 price point.
My 3rd tear down,  U just destroyed every single pixel 😂.
a
Believe it or not.. that’s literally the only review I’ve seen on this product so far.
It passed the bend test. That's a positive.
Good thing the Vision Pro won’t be in my pocket with keys and coins
so basically, the front glass is moot.
FINALLY
While other teardowns try to salvage most of it, jerry here yeets everything out. Yes this is what I want!!!
Hands up on who thought it was scratch resistant..
Did it pain you to destroy that I mean I know it is a tax right off but ouch
Yes Jerry, it’s also aluminum, glass and carbon fiber, wonder why only plastic is the only material worth of mentioning?🤔
For $3500 i could buy an s24 ultra plus meta quest 2! So nah thnks apple 😂
Now THIS made me smile…😄
You have to much money in your hands... that razor blade is to expensive! 😂just kidn.
This teardown was more how I approach most deconstruction attempts in my life
One big question I have in ur videos is whether you sell the disassembled parts.  But this reckless teardown shows otherwise xD
My best protagonist ever.
yeah its cool and all but $3500 is not justifiable when this type of tech has been around for years.
Apple can make some really cool stuff, wish they were not so much like Apple.
ifixit vision pro teardown is pretty cook
Sheesh. Level 3 scratches is wild. Even my $15 Fake apple watch from Amazon has a better scratch level then that.
I absolutely LOVED that you put it back on at the end, that was the best part. Thanks for making this video Zack, its what we all were waiting for
Jerry, I beg of you please give a warning before you scrape your blade on metal parts 😂. Makes me die everytime and i have to frantically skip forward
Omg what a savage tear down 😢😂
😂  the apple sheep aren't gonna like this
What is the difference from this and my Samsung s7 edge came with its vr? Do tell or just apple got there 6/7 years later.?? 8:58
The love of a thousand grandmas 🤣🤣😂
It’s glass
Seeing someone demolish a $3500 products hurts to see regardless of who bought it!
3500 bucks and plastic in and out. Aouch
Thanks for amazing tear down video. This is what I would like to see its internal components. Thanks so much.
Bros out here durability reviewing 4K casually 💀
I had that not so pleasant feeling in my kidmeys as you hate tested this Lamborghini of the face
Thank you Jerry for save us a ton of money :))
Casually destroying my monthly salary💀💀💀
it still might be a flop, I mean whos gonna get it?
this one hurts.....
absolutely insane that it isn't in the least bit scratch resistant, what if somebody bumps into a basement wall? lol
I always find these tear downs super interesting. Thanks for your work Zach!
The gadget killer....
Quickest way inside! 🤣  You crack me up, subtly 😂
Oof normally I can stomach these videos but with the $3,500 I couldn't even watch the whole thing. Scratches at a level 3???
Definitely a Zionist creation
Bro you've come to far to still be wasting sht like this ENOUGH ALREADY
Carnage :)
Boy! That was hard to watch! :-) I thought you check a few thinks and back off.  Wow $3500... gone!  Thanks! that was fun to watch!  Great Video!
Wonder how many people scratched their in first day of use... Apple calls that glass? Who cares what other then top layers are.... Stupid.
This is the Vision Pro video I've been looking forward to!
You did the right thing here Jerry.. You did the right thing.
imagine, Ellons neuralink with this Vision Pro, no more clicking with fingers
I will do a push up for every like this comment gets
I feel like Apple chose plastic because people would start using this is public and they don't want everyone walking around with a cracked outer display. Plastic is harder to crack, although easier to scratch. As to why it is plastic on the inside lens...sigh...to avoid lawsuits? Cracked glass shooting into your eyes I guess could be dangerous...I don't know...but I don't think it is 'to be cheap'. Apple is charging $3500 a pop minimum, they don't have to be cheap...
Ready Player One
Start to see scratches at a level NO, with deeper grooves and a LEVEL WHY?!?!
I couldn’t stop laughing when he just casually started burning the yarn strap.
this was the hardest video I ever had to watch seriously seeing the thing I love so much and want to have of my own but don't have the money to buy it destroyed infant of my eyes I don't blame jerry channel is all about it but still🥲
zack be doing what we secretly dream about doing kkkk
Physically cringed when you scratched the micro oled display.
This is a shame by apple, very disappointing.
11:45. Yes! I have a disability called CP. I can only use an eye gaze device, and so I have very limited control over my hands. Maybe a blink to select?
I bet it still works.
The one problem with the double blink to click, its kinda hard to track someone's eye, when the eyes are closed...
Great work as usual
Super dissapointing that the front is so susceptible to scratching
Thumbs UP MAN!
I've never been happier to watch $3500 worth of hardware be tested.
I hate this. Great video.
this is no where near worth $3500, the build is just soo bleh and the components used arent even that expensive $1000 and now that seems like a good price.
After brutal postmortem, the finger clicks at the end. 😂
A new Apple product with screens as soft as an early 2000's nugget phone is definitely not something I would have ever thought possible.
This has to be one of the most painful videos I have ever watched.
irra irra
Finally....the truth!!!
i know this is way to late but would have loved to see how many scratches it takes to stop the tracking from working
Ever since MKBHD made a video on the Apple Vision Pro I’ve been waiting for a video on it from you.
I giggled a little when you removed the cord from the battery because MKBHD said it was not removable without going to the Apple Store. I know you can't use any other cables on it, but it still made me laugh.
First 40000 !
“Tears of loneliness” - DAMN, that hit deep
Don’t care if it was indestructible…. I cannot afford even a third of that
IT LOOKS LIKE 100$ PRODUCTS NOT 3500$ AS HE GOES ON DAMAGING IT.
Finally catching the videos as they upload.
The front glass being covered in plastic kind of makes sense to me, considering if that glass shatters, and glass dust falls off of it whilst you're removing it, you will get glass dust in your eyes, which can cause blindness or permanent damage. Although, it would be nice if it were a removable layer. Still not a product I'd ever want,
Thank you for saying what I've been telling everyone about the accessibility! I was thinking if it could see your mouth, opening and closing your lips could make it click too.
11:34 He just advocated for his wife. That is so sweet of him
The moment that we are waiting for xd
This was a extra expensive teardown, but I approve because it's apple.
Your worldview was already messed up after looking at your account balance 😂
Imagine if apple just made the plastic covering simply replaceable and cheap, but that would require them to be consumer friendly, which equates to pouring holy water on a witch.
The new scuba gear😂😂
I’m literally screaming at my phone don’t light the band on fire 😅
Right on schedule. Thank you Zack.
My daughter needs one of those not a wheel chairs
You should give the quest 3 a go. For 1/7th the price it's definitely worth looking at.
tears of loneliness
Hey @jerryrigeverything please             Please try other language like Hindi you're channel grow more from Indian audience some channel have audio language option thanks Love from India ❤❤❤ I do mobile repair I have mobile repairing channel
In Jerry hands it’s life span is short 😂
"tears of loneliness" 🤣 😅
Did it bite your thumb 👍 😂
So much for my anxiety, that was painful to watch!
Most anticipated video of 2024.
Change your profile picture of you wearing the thing
He tore that up lol 😂 $4000 plus crazy expensive. Not worth it . Don’t care what it does .
HELL YEAH, WAS WAITING FOR THIS
Forget the glass, WHY is there still a lightning port? Wth, why not USB C? Wow, shame on you apple.
Liked because you destroyed it.
Why he open with knife 😢
I'm never going to buy an Apple product simply due to how horrible they are to self repair, but that being said even I can't deny the quality.
One of your best videos !
The fact you noted the voltage of the battery is why you are the real MVP. You definitely are a battery expert now!
11:27 Apple Vision Pro already lets you use your wrist to control it! Pointer Control lets you use your head, wrist, or your index finger kinda like a Meta Quest controller. There are also ways to use it without hands at all, Dwell Control lets you click a button when you stare at it for a set amount of time.
Watching that was rough... good lord!!
That is one brave Apple Watch laying there.
wow this is fire 🔥🔥
Boys will see this and say "Hell yeah!"
Guys...... Its happening!!!!!!
I wish your voice wasnt so soft and gay
I really waiting for this.
I'm not an Apple fanboy, but Zach ripping the internals cover (the fluffy stuff) sent shivers up my spine!  Thank you.
This video proves that Zach just likes burning things. There was no reason to burn that headband lmao
Apple making easy money with this expensive VR headset  they don't care about quality anymore its all about making maximum profit  by using cheaper quality materials thanks jerry rig for showing the reality Those whack ass Apple fan boys/girls will buy it anyways.
I'm glad my $200 Quest 2 has glass lenses. There is no way in hell I would spend $3500 on a VR headset that has PLASTIC lenses. gtfo. I was planning on getting an iPhone for my next phone. Guess I will be looking elsewhere. 🤦
Tears of loneliness hahah
Hahaha this is so awesome! Apple strikes again! Plastic!!!!!
you should sell off little chunks of it, so people can own a piece of the vision pro 💀
$3,500 and it's plastic...
At least the eye cover on the Quest headsets are hard plastic… this plastic plate looks really brittle.
$3000 for a plastic front “glass”?!
Love your reviews man. Your factual comments crack me up because of how true they are :)))
Bro that was hurt 😢
that shit should be made out of diamonds for 3.5k 💀
800 bucks for this procedure when my razor only costs 15 😂😂
This one hurt a bit more to watch than usual
OMG.  11:30 The BORG!
Where the battle damaged on your thumb came from?
Samsung : upgrades to level 7 with deeper groves at level 8  Apple : backwards
If I really think about it, I don't really need it
It hurts more then any video of you, I couldn’t even see this product in my hand, though I can’t effort to get one your breaking and burning like this.
criminal waste of a $3500 product for, I’d have to say, very little useful information. You could just say, ‘take care with the screens and don’t set fire to it. We’d all be just as informed 🤷🏼‍♂️
not that its surprising from apple but its absolutely appalling how this thing has been built so that not even the most skilled technician has any hope of repairing anything
Bro called us broke in infinite languages 💀💀💀💀
I'll need to remember to avoid catching my hair on fire if I ever get this. Wouldn't want to burn that expensive headband.
Thank you for letting me hear the cry of Apple Vision Pro for the first time
Actually imo glass could make the vision even more heavier. I am more furious about the plastic in the lenses as on the outside screen. But nonetheless sensors should not be covered behind plastic but it’s good that some sensors are still behind glass  Edit: oh the outter display IS actually glass behind plastic so my weight argument is useless
for $3500 you’d be expecting glass for the lenses too but nope i guess not
IT HERE!!!
R.I.P vision pro. we will always remember you.
Put those things down once and you have 1 million scratches, great.
Danggg, first Vision Pro to experience hardship RIP 🫶
3000 dollars for plastic? 😆 Apple is wild
Ouch
I don't know why but I didn't expect this video to drop... you manhandled that $4k face computer
NOTHING CAN GET OUT OF HIS HANDS.
This makes me so sad, RIP vision pro
9:03  "This piece of plastic alone costs more than many iphones" 😵‍💫
Hay Jerry you’re definitely not gonna see this but when’s the next bunker video bro?
There are 2 layers
Bro calling all of us broke in every way possible
Yeahh yeahh I know this is coming 😂😂😂 completely satisfied 😅😅😅😅
Now, let's put it back together
Not glass huh... odd.   That said, glass is heavy, so I dont blame them
Tears of lonliness 🤣
He has a black band-aid after 6:40, and not before.
Apple is Apple and Apple Breaks😅
Like this post February 5 2024
Get a case, Get a screen protector!
I agree with you about accessibility.
This is going to be his most viewed video
And there it's ladies and gentlemen
"Kitted with the love of 1000 grandmas" 😂😂😂 Actually, knitted by the tiny calloused fingers of a small child at a sweatshop in China.  Love your show.
I've been waiting for this video!  Edit: I was really hoping you tore the battery down as well. It makes no sense that it's that big, yet isn't even 4K mAh of power. It should be at least 10K and am convinced they just have weights in the thing taking up space!
Watching this I am crying 😢this is 5million naira that Jerry is rigging wow God 🙆🏾‍♂️
I love watching the phone durability tests... but sad to see such a beautiful new product get destroyed😥Either way, great video!
LOL. Great teardown ;-).  Yep, Apple should have been a bit more sensitive to disable persons who could benifit a lot from this device.   Tks
So are you going to work with Dbrand to release a forward glass protector for vision pro with your eyes printed as 3d effects? 🤣
Nice, caught the video early 😎
This hurts
🤣Everything tested
oh no....
Wow. The ease and joy in which he destroys this work of art is a work of art. 😅
I cried watching this
Did Zach NEED to light the headband on fire? No. Did he do it anyway? Hell yeah!
I was literally just waiting for this to come out
Cant imagine the look on the apple designer and engineers who helped put all this together with pride !!!
Why in the hell did Apple let you get your hands on the Apple Vision Pro 😂
..tears of loneliness 😂
Imagine if everyone did this.
I KNEW IT!! just by watching the reviews i doubt it was real glass
$4000 It better NOT fuckin be plastic.
I've been waiting  see this thing for so long
Jerry you forgot teardown the batteries.
Ready player one is near
It costs $3,500 to pay for all that thermal paste!!!
13:19 Ah~ So that's how you're supposed to use this. 😏
This hurts me... And im so anti apple its stupid
We needed this video as soon as the vision pro was announced
Oh my. You didn't do this...
It’s a good day when Jerry posts a video
4:29 I am sorry for your thumb but I see 6:41 you fixed it.
there r scheduled text messages on iphones !!!!
Great job on the video 🎉
Didn't expect you to actually review it, but hey, you learn something new every day... it's plastic ... not that I have 3.5k to spend, though ...
This was painful to watch
Yay! So awesome Zach!
This guys voice is soo relaxing 😌
Increíble verlos así 👏👏👏👏
It looks better on the inside than it does the outside.
I liked my comment.
Didn't bother my brain by watching other reviews before watching this one, i can walk out into the world now, thank you.
This teardown  is really  fun😂
👇Here as soon as this video came out
This was the video I’ve been waiting on. All the others are cool but yours are the best. I wanna see what the thing is made of. Something no one ever gets to really see. Y’all should create a screen protector for them!
No
Video of the Year!
watch the next gen of this device have the glass on the outside,
That was soo soo satisfying.
Do we care if it's not a screen, though? Are there any VR headsets with glass on the front?
Apple gonna dox you for this one Zach
"This is $3,500"... Then proceeds to scratching it
i checked the channel at least 5 times this past week to see if this video has dropped.  Then it dropped right before my exam.  I AM WATCHING IT NOW
The most violent of Zacks teardown by far!!! Seemed so personal 😂😂!!!
This is the video that we've been waiting for :D
this thing is a pure engineering goodness
Maybe clean back the table?
I was hoping you will do a durability test on thesee. I am so happy you did
Wow, very cheaply made for such an expensive device.
Scratches at a level 3 with deeper grooves at a level 4????
Why yo do that it’s so expensive
Apple is Cheaper than granny smith.
😅
Looking forward to where VR is in 5 years
With AppleCare, it’s $300 for any and all repairs, as they just ship you a whole new unit. That’s the difference (still ridiculously expensive)
$3.5k for plastic is crazy
Ifixt it tear down -❌ Jerryrig teardown- ✅
Long live the galaxy  note 10 plus!
Did the Vision Pro test the Durability of your thumb?
Finally
Vision pro: portable heater on your face.
Nice 11:38 oooof the propriety plug of course
We waitting for 🎉
very beautiful piece of tech that I really couldn’t find a reason to buy it
I will never buy this one! Apple is ripping so many customers off.
3:18 and just like that, it has lost ANY appeal. When a gimmick costs 300 donald ducks to replace, you'd have to be struck in the head to purchase this. This device still doesn't solve VR's biggest issue, which is that it strains the eyes. Nearsightedness, caused by how schools are managed are a thing, imagine how much VR damages one's eyes with extended use. Several countries have now introduced programs to regress the exacerbated growth of myopic children going adults. I wouldn't use a VR device, extended use of a screen (its position near one's face - not the BS about blue light which has been debunked)  is damaging enough.
1 st
I was waiting this video! greetings from Honduras.
That's some expensive plastic
Feels like it's been knitted with the love of a thousand grandmas!😂😂
Seeing a $3,500 electronic product being torn to shreds is satisfying in a sense
Smartphones, Smart TVs, now we have Smart Goggles. What will we have next? Smartpeople?
Bro... The fact the lenses are so easy to scratch is a VERY bad sign
The moment of the deeper grooves is finally here!!
✌
Noooo. Don’t do it Zach 😭😭😭😭
Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooo
cool.. not put it back
282
the vision pro video we’ve all been waiting for
ended the video @ 10:02 nope cant do it omg it shivered down my spine
The iFixIt teardown was like aged wagyu beef while Zack's teardown was the bolt gun to the head of the cow
this. hurts to watch and its not my money
Ha its funny I was looking up if JerryRigEverything had a video on the apple vision pro this morning and there was nothing (Clearly I just had to wait lol!)
Watching this on my Vision Pro right now and seeing yours in pieces and on fire makes me cringe, lol. I have been babying mine so far, and based on the teardown I will take even more care with mine going forward since plastic is plastic and plastic scratches so easily.
وه نه كه به ختئ خودئ
We all love you
Every time I watch one of these videos I wonder why I don't watch more. And then I get to the unbearable aluminum scratching sound. I just can't stand it.
I love watching this guy destroy expensive electronics.
When is the bunker coming back?
Some left overs from the samsung can be seen......can you also try running some car over it for more durability assurance 🫣🙈.
How dare you do that to a brand new one man
Lmao they got fans??? Those things are gonna be dusty in at least a month
LOL... the straps come off like a sim-card tray... just poke the holes.
Where you not expecting the cloth to burn?
Makes sense. You were it on your head and it’s heavy. Best not to be made from glass. Saves on weight too.
This better make it to the trending page.
Oh soo painful to watch 3,500 dollars down the drain
Even if you're not an apple fan, destroying a beautiful piece of engineering like this must hurt.. I appreciate this guys dedication to taking everything apart lol, reminds me of when I was a kid
Great review as usual ..
Ah! someone destroying this awful product? Im in, thanks Jerry!!
Here before this get 1 mil. (Reply 1 million chain)
3500 and you dont even get any glass surface??? what a fucking ripoff
Wow, the price tag on this vr headset and their "glass" being so easily scratched is insane!
You are hiding something about your thumb
YUIHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Is there anything we can do to stop this cruelty to tech?  If you need a ransom paid, give us plenty of time and we can get something organised.  We would need proof of life of course.
Please keep dogging on apple
Ifixit removed the speaker portion using the sim card style holes that unlock it
this was crazy entertaining
I like how I got a Samsung ad for a Apple video. I'm a samsung fan, so I wanna see what the hype on this thing is about. Especially with it being 4k
4k down the drain........  Edit: It's OK it's an Apple   🥲
I've been looking forward to this :)
Ooh😮🎉
Apple drones will buy anything
Anyone spending that much money on this thing no matter how good it is, have more money than sense.
wow, wasnt expecting the front to NOT be fully glass and actually be a piece of glass covered by plastic, wow the inner lenses too
Disclaimer: No Apple brand lovers were harmed in this video
Yikes, pretty sure the lenses in my Quest 2 are glass...
$3500 Microsoft HoloLens 2 video when?
Why bro ?
sponsored by apple
Loved how you calmly procedeed to burn that thing down while still talking about the glass.
Damn Jerry you went all in too quick on this VP 💀
I love your videos Jerry 😉
3400+ dollars hunk of plastic.
LOL AppleCare does not care. 🤣
Vision pro: I thought I'd be treated like a king
OMG DUDE. What is wrong with you? A phone i understand. MAYBE..... but this was 3500$!!!!!
The front plastic is a cover with adhesive, and replaceable. There have been a few videos of people cracking it and using the headset without it.
Cutting with a knife through the peeling bands is next level unboxing lol
Platic at 3500$. Shame on Apple.
Respect Jerry, wow
I happily buy Apple Nothing..
We already watched a good video teardown from IFIXIT and thats a very good video than this mess
Honestly they should have just gone with high-quality clear plastic for the front cover. At least then the likelihood of it shattering on impact is extremely reduced. But then ofc they wouldn't be able to sell as many $800 replacements.
I saw one person walking in public with one, and boy do they look silly. Waiting for the news of injuries next.
It hurts to see you take a knife to that defenseless plastic-covered glass. :)
I'm pretty sure at this point you're just buying for functionality and features.
Oh shit its trash and I can see that catching fire from an overheated battery watch for fires coming soon Apple pro
Tittok is banned in india❤
why oh why are the lenses made of plastic, even my cheap quest 2 and its cheap prescription lenses are all glass, jesus $3500, apple knows its customers well
With the videos of people going out with these the tests actually make sense. Thank you Mr Everything
oh shit, time to drop everything, this is gonna be good
Could you give me the damaged version lol
I apple 🍎 envision 👀 destruction on the horizon .    LoL 😂
Yoo was waiting for this, thank you!!
Hi Jerry. Remember me? I know what you did back in '96. I know.
Watching it being destroyed was glorious, what an overpriced POS
I'm not buying this this but it's pretty interesting to see what's inside
You could have removed the speaker band using a sim ejector tool.
Wooohhh I want to see that one!!
Isn't it the most expensive test on your channel?
bro yeeted $3500 for science :D
Scar on my soul are building up.
😢
I was hoping he would do this one, and he did!
The future is basically 24/7 free advertisement on your face
3.5k out to the trash 😅😅
we needed this so much, Thank you!
FINALLY!
Plastic is plastic.. and plastic brea- wait, what?
Clickbait misleading title - WELL DONE!!
Imagine scratchin the "glass" exactly where the cameras are and having them not read the evironment. Cool piece of tech.
Watching this on my Apple Vision Pro 😳
not really keen on this "not designed to be repaired" design.
Been waiting for this guy 😂 0:46
oh god he's actually doing it lol
you destroyed a 3500$ device. It will take me many months to earn it. It hit my back.😭
most of people can't afford Apple Vision Pro, its very pricey.  I wonder how much it cost to make??????   your channel help people to make smart decisions to buy a right products.   Apple Vision Pro is made in China for cheap labor with skill workers, but very pricey
Legend.
How on earth are they selling this for 3500. Absolutely none of this screams luxury or premium
You could easily wet sand those scratches out!!!
can’t wait to watch this video after this ad.
“Scratches at a level 3 with deeper grooves at a level 2” Me: cries in $3500 + applicable taxes.
Hopefully they won't everyone the same like the iphone 11 iPhone 12 iPhone 13 iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15
A moment of silence for Zack's bank account sacrifice ~
my one month income destory in seconds 😂😂
oh boi this gon be good
I wouldn't cope unless this video makes at least 3.5k$
Here we go
Helloooo
I’m EARLY BABY!! 🎉
This generation is already spoiled from technology, AR is the last thing we need.
Vision pro
Apple has amazing design..... Nah, im good.
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO LOL
as you know Apple was Apple
no shot he actually bought one of these to destroy it for us
No one expected scratches at a level *Wubblwubb with deeper grooves at a level *Flabbanasta!!!!
It was knitted by 50 starving 3rd world country men
My theory is that Apple chose shatter resistance over scratch resistance since scratches don’t break any functionality compared to it being shattered.  (I’m sure you know this but the softer the glass the better shatter resistance, and the harder the glass the better scratch resistance)
For once they are right, plastic equals to be light.
It's scratches in level 3 and a deeper screw level 4 😅
Love jerry's soothing voice. Thanks for the durability test!
This is seriously the worst headset I've ever tried. My gear vr from 2015 is significantly better
Era tudo o que eu queria ver, obrigado
OH GOD THE PAIN
This one’s gonna hurt
bro wasted 4000 dollars in 13 minutes :((( luv ur content
This was posted 2min ago
I can remember that comment from MKBHD's video.  Jerry couldn't wait to upload this 😂😂
For that price I expect at least the basic exterior to be titanium.
I KNEW THIS VIDEO WAS COMING! so excited
Guess what I’m watching this in ;)
오늘도 즐거운 하루
Viva Franco
Oh my god
Yikes... scratches at level 3 for a $3,500 device 😂
🙂🙂
It needs a remote, my eyes always dart around so I'd select the wrong stuff all the time with this
hey guys if you like tech check out unboxed analysis
🗿❤️
Straight from twitter
nice
OMG!! What a huge waste of money. It'll make some decent metal-working safety goggles. I also have been waiting for this vid to drop. 🤣
Every video i see makes me think the external display is just so unnecessary, and adding needless cost.
I liked my own comment unfortunately
Finally
Can’t wait for the South Park episode
He Is Here To Test 😂 3500 Bucksss  Headset  Love From Pakistan❤
11:18 carnage
1400 views in 2 mins lol wow
Knew this video was coming, still hurts watching it 😢

Love you content 😘 🇳🇵
