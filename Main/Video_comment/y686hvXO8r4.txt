Very Cute!
Anyone In 2025?
The ending we all wanted! So, the gems can be made by other letters, but only once. Interesting… 🤔 I wonder if the other letters ever feel bad after this, or did they all forget overtime?
For 2025: #alphabetlore #numberlore
Villains aren't born.. Villains are made.. (For example F)
I think F and N are friends because of the word "FUN"
Happy to see this 😍тьрилопрор рор

I can see F on the top and still it turns out mike forgot to remove it in the epoligue. Theres another one, the sky is too white and the original sky looks like 96% white in whole series in the alphabet lore and another one. F’s house isnt right-shaped the hole is too black and you can see F in the cave.
n should've taken the period and colon with him
Now the letters know what they did

Now that was the ending look like they kind all the letters the n knows the cutscene , problem and realizing eomething they happend to n we know n is bulled by o, l and sometimes f but n realized f , p and all the letters like U, G M, U, A and Y even the Z those capital letters know it. They are helping n and n realized everything he is stronger than l and o and also n are friends with f and also p no the letters lived happily and Z never be sad and turn into a z or i should mean small
so if n is fs friend why did he kill him
What society should be like
It’s amazing on how YouTube recommended this 2 years later
I understand how F became evil and he had a painful story I feel bad for him 😭😭😭😭😭😭

gяєєк αℓρнαвєт
I think of n being the size of a peanut
I don’t like how nobody Is giving Q credit for giving N the question mark, if it was only Z, then they would’ve just went back in time and the same thing would’ve happened, but Q have N the question mark so he can know what’s gonna happen in the future,
More sadder than the alphabet lore 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
But i am unhappy
I am unhappy
I'm not happy about it
N didn't get a black eye
Then i think its fanmade 💀
I love how Q spended his entire life just to get to the letters

Q knew everything because he ate? When he ate it, it showed him their future so I realize he had to save the world, but due to his letter. He’s also based off a snail would make him too slow to catch up also since you got?? Also stands for why did this happen? She started crying because time was affecting him due to the bad stuff without some of the letters it can go completely wrong if you look closely or actually tears, use them to reverse and gave n? During the time reversal Q1 they were working together and interested end to fix the timeline after he stop being a coward and saved F and when they both got beat up because their friendship stayed close together in the end, all F wanted was to stay with an when and hug P She got to see what happened to and that’s the end
Me
If you replay it a lot of times it gets more sad
Who’s here in 2025?

No cares F is Bad
1:13 Japan when the were switched to the allies (not the axis anymore)
I just realized I think n and z are the only ones that like f or z is just sad f killed most of the alphabet and doesn’t care about f
0:17 BTW I love your animation
I like the story changes up in the ending f didn't have no friends and p and j  died and the good ending  f and n and got bulled together and p didn't die and f and n are friends again
I like how on the final beat where it supposed to sound like "Now i know my abcs next time wont you sing with me" but in my eyes it sounds like A b c d e f g h i j k l m n If you do that it legit ends on N
i like how N Q Z are literally the main characters and Q literally just gives N memory for what he did to make him friends with F in the future and Z helps N and F by literally taking N to the past and literally making the better choice and also making F not evil
awh... how sweet... F and N are gonna get married someday and have children... how nice😊 (this is a joke, don't take this seriously)
0:10 2 F's?

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z!
you know what else is crazy?     alphabet, set of graphs, or characters, used to represent the phonemic structure of a language. In most alphabets the characters are arranged in a definite order, or sequence (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).  In the usual case, each alphabetic character represents either a consonant or a vowel rather than a syllable or a group of consonants and vowels. As a result, the number of characters required can be held to a relative few. A language that has 30 consonant sounds and five vowels, for example, needs at most only 35 separate letters. In a syllabary, on the other hand, the same language would require 30 × 5 symbols to represent each possible consonant-vowel syllable (e.g., separate forms for ba, be, bi, bo, bu; da, de, di; and so on) and an additional five symbols for the vowels, thereby making a total of 155 individual characters. Both syllabaries and alphabets are phonographic symbolizations; that is, they represent the sounds of words rather than units of meaning.  The word alphabet, from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet—alpha and beta—was first used, in its Latin form, alphabetum, by Tertullian (2nd–3rd century CE), a Latin ecclesiastical writer and Church Father, and by St. Jerome. The Classical Greeks customarily used the plural of to gramma (“the letter”); the later form alphabētos was probably adopted under Latin influence.  The evolution of the alphabet involved two important achievements. The first was the step taken by a group of Semitic-speaking people, perhaps the Phoenicians, on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean between 1700 and 1500 BCE. This was the invention of a consonantal writing system known as North Semitic. The second was the invention, by the Greeks, of characters for representing vowels. This step occurred between 800 and 700 BCE. While some scholars consider the Semitic writing system an unvocalized syllabary and the Greek system the true alphabet, both are treated here as forms of the alphabet.   Over the centuries, various theories have been advanced to explain the origin of alphabetic writing, and, since Classical times, the problem has been a matter of serious study. The Greeks and Romans considered five different peoples as the possible inventors of the alphabet—the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Cretans, and Hebrews. Among modern theories are some that are not very different from those of ancient days. Every country situated in or more or less near the eastern Mediterranean has been singled out for the honour. Egyptian writing, cuneiform, Cretan, hieroglyphic Hittite, the Cypriot syllabary, and other scripts have all been called prototypes of the alphabet. The Egyptian theory actually subdivides into three separate theories, according to whether the Egyptian hieroglyphic, the hieratic, or the demotic script is regarded as the true parent of alphabetic writing. Similarly, the idea that cuneiform was the precursor of the alphabet may also be subdivided into those singling out Sumerian, Babylonian, or Assyrian cuneiform.  Among the various other theories concerning the alphabet are the hypotheses that the alphabet was taken by the Philistines from Crete to Palestine, that the various ancient scripts of the Mediterranean countries developed from prehistoric geometric symbols employed throughout the Mediterranean area from the earliest times, and that the proto-Sinaitic inscriptions (discovered since 1905 in the Sinai Peninsula) represent a stage of writing intermediate between the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the North Semitic alphabet. Another hypothesis, the Ugaritic theory, evolved after an epoch-making discovery in 1929 (and the years following) at the site of the ancient Ugarit, on the Syrian coast opposite the most easterly cape of Cyprus. Thousands of clay tablets were found there, documents of inestimable value in many fields of research (including epigraphy, philology, and the history of religion). Dating from the 15th and 14th centuries BCE, they were written in a cuneiform alphabet of 30 letters.

If Q knew that he should give N the question mark stone that means the whole of Alphabet Lore happened at least twice by this point.   Really emphasises what F went through.  Amazing job on the animations, Mike.
Aww, Letter F and Letter N became friends. That's something for sure.

Q: Is This Happening?
Season 1 alphabet lore season 2 number lore season 3 new alphabet lore 2022 & 2024
Perfect ending
So nobody nows y n is the main character?
So L and O made fun of F and N and made F spell Frick and make everyone hate him, and N is a coward and stands by the people that hurt him. Then A - Z happens, and in this, Z rolls back time and Q gives N the question mark, making past N know what happens if he sides with L and O, so he decides to stay with F, making none of this happen, amd when they're all grown up and capital letters, Number lore happens

Although he was killed in Y, if you look very closely, F is strangely seen alive in the cave's mouth like in ‌nZ…. This could probably be because Mike Salcedo forgot to remove him from there.

I feel bad for  f being  bullied  in the first  video  📹 😔
Look Q and Quick is coming the magical power chosen girl
0:21  Q knew that as long as he had the ? he would not lose his memory after Z’s time reset. But in an act of selflessness he gave it to N at the last second so that he could make the right decision and save the alphabet from F by making friends with him before he became evil. Q is and absolute chad.
yay
We finally got to know who our ABC's really were.

The reason why V is not there cause V got scared when he looked inside F’s cave and V got scared and left
0:13  Z becomes Saturn.
Accidentally watching this before the rest of the series was quite an experience.

Z reverse the planet
1:47 ! 2:04 Z is happy
Mike can you please do russian alphabet lore but make Д the villan
Z was like yeah going back to the past TO FIX ALL THIS
Baby z is so cute
Z a real one fr. He didn’t want to see his inhabitants in turmoil with each other, so he had the courage to go back in time a split the timelines so that F and N were forever with each other and so that they could live happily ever after
2 Number lore
I love it. Now he's hungry 🍑🥭🧁🍭🧃🍴
Z reversed time so N can fix the mistake he made to hurt F's feelings, he stood up to F and now N and F are good friends, and they lived happily ever after.
M is good guy
FRIENDS DIES AGNUYQ Z K LO BWT V C X J 😢
I wished Z was N on its side, would’ve made a great idea
I think Z`s planet is going round and round
Love it
The beginning could possibly actually make you shed a tear at first.
Por favor dejen de estar estos videos!!!
GOOD ENDING
Did you know that when the letters are sad in the cave and it zooms out you can actually see f in the top of the cave mad. Isn’t f dead though
Why Big Letter F Attacks other letters?
1:41 Baby P 2
😢EFFFFFFFF
I love this story so much!
So this is season 1 season 2 is number lore? Season 3 shape lore? Season 4 colour lore? And season 5 emoji lore?😅 I know this is a bad theory

Alphabet Lore Is The Best. Animation. EVER. TYSM For Making Alphabet Lore A Thing! It Was So Emotional, Heart Warming, And Awesome! And I Love All Of The Characters! Can't Wait For Number Lore To Be Finished ❤
Yay me and N are friends again🎉
The fact J was vaporized and my name starts with a J and the fact no one cared was like💀

Now I know my ABC😊
Z was like “I gotta get the pacifist ending”
He made alphabet lore which got really popular but what about the original…..the original popular one…   IM HUFFIN AND PUFFIN I GO TO THE KITCHEN I MAKE ME A SANDWICH
Honestly, with Z's tears representing an ellipses, we should have seen a continuation coming.
😊😊😊
Zero two days X
W v u t s
The story of this epilogue: Z reversed time to redo the end. N was bullied instead of F but he stood up for it and remembered that the other letters called him a coward. He also knew that F was trying to be his friend and he should not betray him. The 2 finally got together and made the planet happy.
What's this?

I did not know about the Epilogue until a few hours ago. I'm glad to see that the past was altered, and everything was changed for the better. I bet F will be different in the new future.
I love the detail that P was the only one deserving of the the super crystal thing. Also... you read this ^ wrong. I bet 0 dollars on it.
2 Hello
Z: I got to make things right okay Q let's get everything back to normal I got to spin my memorys okay? Q:noway N I got the ? For you to make things right. N: okay let's do this

Ifhiyxdh❤❤❤❤❤❤❤z

We'll miss it... so badly
go Z you no
Wheres lowercase q x and y
This good and bad ending makes me want to cry. 😢
What is happening with Z
This was like an actual movie I freaking love it
Fn is a simple way of abbreviating "fine." It's most often used to say "that's fine," in response to a statement or question. For example, if your SO asks whether you're okay with having Chinese food for dinner, and Chinese is okay by you, you could answer with a simple "yup, tht's fn."
I am a fan can you please please please please join me
F and N are Friend

Theory: Without N, it says, “Frieds” Since F was fried through the heart.
The two least commonly used letters, doing the most happiest ending ever!
It’s cooler when you slow it down to 0.25
2:08 The end
1:56 Letter F loven Letter N ❤❤❤❤

If even Z was a baby where did their parents live when THEY were lowercase
Casi lloro😢😊
◕‿◕
I liked how z had the ability to time travel
L and O made this all happen
Nice baby n😇
The alphabet lore is like the alphabet song like "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ now I know my ABC's" But with a twist
Z:nah i want F Happy No Way N Gonns Betray Him
z is a very interesting letter (or planet, in this case)
Alphabet lore 9❤
2:03 z
0:10 Z
Q cookie or an alien or bowling ball when you but q it don’t do anything kw better example: kwite kwuite
Literally know one cares about j, m and h’s deaths when they all care about c and p’s deaths
1:42 These is a Lowercase voice of P.
❤❤🎉
I thought Alphabet Lore was cancelled.
The internet has gone too far
- Q: That was what really happened. - G: Oh my god. We would not have had to kill F. - N: And we cannot revert anything anymore. - Z: Or maybe we can. Q, be ready! _(Begins to roll time backwards.)_ - K: Wait a second, what is happening? - Q: Take this gem, N. _(Throws question mark to N.)_ _(Z rolls time backwards, to the right point.)_ - F: _(Is tripping on N.)_ Woaah! - N: Wait a second, N! What did other letters do to your best friend? And what should N do at this moment? _(Looks first at O.)_ That guy just beat you up. _(Looks then at L.)_ Oh my god, L bade me something cool. _(Looks then at F.)_ But F is your real friend that you know, and he did not do anything on purpose. And of course, some letters are thinking that I am a coward. But I cannot be coward anymore! I need to stop this shit! _(Begins to walk to F. And then stand between F, and L, M and O.)_ - F: What is happening?! - N: Stop ganking up F! He is not guilty to that ugly word! L and O are the real guilties to that. They pushed F to that disgusting word against his will. F is really a good person and I will not leave him! _(L, M and O are looking at N as confused.)_ - F: Thanks, mate! - L: So, N betrayed us?! - O: Seems like that he did! We know, what this is causing. - L: If F and N want to spend time together, we have not anything against that. - O: But it will need that N is not welcome to our club anymore! - N: I do not care! - F: We do not need any clubs! - N: We have each others! _(When thrown to land, F and N realise that they really are best friends.)_ - N: Come, F. Let us go to your home. _(N picks F up and they begin to walk to F's cave.)_ - N: Oh, wait a little moment, F. I have something to tell to P. _(N goes between P and G.)_ - N: Do you realise P, that you have been like big sister to me during these moments. Thank you! _(Gives an exclamation mark -gem to P.)_ - P: It is okay, N! _(N goes then back to F, and they walk to F's cave.)_ - Z: This ending I wanted to see.
F did all of this just cause he wanted friends that’s why he was mean
Q white eyes
❤
Oh yeah where is❤😖🥺😭
f and n are  friends.
Final feliz
Z planet
Snail 🐌  q
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Двлфдвлвд
Bro literally needed a happy ending ❤😊
zZ
Like 👍 👌 💛 😙 is the only way
🎉😊
and thats how the key fn was created
I am trying to guess some ages of some characters:  F: 25 (10 during flashback) N: 24 (9 during flashback) G: 29 (14 during flashback) P: 30 (15 during flashback) L: 28 (13 during flashback) M: 27 (12 during flashback) O: 28 (13 during flashback) Q: 31 (16 during flashback) R, I, E, D & S: about 23–26 (8–11 during flashback) A: 25 (10 during flashback) B: 25 (10 during flashback) C: 30 (15 during flashback)  And yes, I am thinking that the flashback (in episodes "nZ" and "Epilogue") takes about 15 years back in time.   Edit: I fixed the age of C, because he can be a bing brother of G, and if G is 29, C should be at least an year older.
The ending we all need
1:24, They both said N
MAKE ALPHABET LORE EXTINCT NOW
I just realized: both F and N are boys so N is gay
2?
but i like the good ending not the bad ending. thank you for the alphabet lore Mike!
Anyways i just loveee alphabet lore and also my favorite alphabet lore is p
2:00 Letter Z. The end
1:28 Letter F and Letter N love 30 seconds. 1:40 Letter N and Letter P love 2 seconds❤
Alphabet Lore 2017 Bonus, perfect!
Best ending, made me cry empathy irl thanks for this! :)
The way why Z reversed the time it's that because Q and Z were work together to redo the time
Did u stop to think that now i know my abcs is better to lmo than f & n? Explanation: 1. Lmo is still on the loose, so other letters Will bê bullied too, f and n count too 2. Abcdeg... Everyone but F and N Will still hate F and N cuz of the "Frick" word untill f dies
At the editors of baby Z

best Friends
This is the good ending to alphabet lore.
Wait dose that mean the Original timeline that f died in doesn't exist anymore?
@juegaGerman
Bad ending: Z is sad because of F Script: (F falls from N and thud, he looks at N.) N: N? (Are you okay?) L, M, and O: (comes to stare at F. N’s nightmare returned. N looks at L and O for what they did to N. And looks F being sad. His pupils show the pictures from present to past, left, L, M and O betrays F, right, F eats C. He looks at the word “coward” in lowercase) N: N! (That’s it! I’m coming for you!) (He walks to F but Uppercase G blocks him but he is brave. L and O blocks N and beat him up. F is now mad. He finally did the same thing as the old future. First, He beaten up L and O. Then, he beaten up all the letters. And now, he finally ate N. Now he goes back to his cave for spelling “frick”. He still looks mad.) F: (to all of the beaten letters that look sad. They all look at F.) F?!?!?!?! (IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?!?!?!?!?!?!) All of the beaten letters: (They felt sad. We zoom out of the planet.) Z: Now it’s very sad again……. (The series fades to black)
n❤️f z💤
Mike salcedo, you might have wished for the uppercase version for the epilogue and the instrumental part.
Z’s voice is like a 40 year old.
UANY GMQ  ????
F YOU DIED

booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
This is the true ending for alphabet lore, and I really like it. Especially if F and N had been friends from the start, this finale is a start of respect.
What a finale!

I wonna make this un flipaclip but My characters si hard to do
Z: This is not a ending i want a good ending Everyone: Help! and then they all forget about f and n's darkness to put up the bad ending z: lol hi z: subscribe to the alphabet most favourate channel! dudes
How did Z turn into z?
Yes I know I'm REAL late but has anyone noticed F before Z closed his eyes?
I'm glad P was revived in the new timeline and her relationship with G is restored. Let's just hope she doesn't die in the new timeline with the numbers. P is my favorite character in the entire alphabet and she and G deserves a second chance.
Turned out great! lol bro, check out my alphabet

We're not fiends or foes we're just we're friends.  F is for Friendship.

0:18 ever noticed that they spell the slang form of “by the way”? it’s almost like “BTW, this only happens every hundred years.”
I like alphabet lore fin this is beautiful and very good and nice 🧡🖤 fn FN

No dummy f isn’t bad
1:29 my favourite music part
Does someone notice that this is a whole story with a meaning? 😮
To be honest F deserved that gem
can you do season 2
Well ya can’t think of a happier ending like this
What a great epilogue
i see like lmao
1:22 no
I love how P is the best letter by far in the entire alphabet, and she's the sweetest too. Maybe in a future episode, P, I, N and K can spell the word Pink and turn pink as well. This might be a good opportunity to learn our colors, if you know what I mean.
Next: super extra extreme good ending of alphabet lore
N lore
Sad to hear that you were Z dies no please no dies alphabet lore
OMG MIKE SALCEDO IS BETTER THAN HKTITO

こうきとれんとるいねとたまきとみずきー
おーいパソコンあっきー
Partie  3
0:01 G, U, A, M, N, and Y all felt ashamed for how they treated F badly 0:04 G, U, A, M, N, and Y looked at F 0:11 Z uses his gems to go back in time 0:16 K, L, O, B, T, and W saw what Z was doing 0:24 Q gave N the question mark gem 0:27 (going back in time) 0:35 n tripped f 0:39 l, m, and o came in 0:42 n didn't know what to do 0:45 n saw what o did to him 0:48 n saw what l did to him 0:52 n saw f helped him 0:54 n sees the past and the future 0:56 coward 0:58 n thinks he isn't a coward 0:59 G appears 1:03 l and o appears 1:12 n stands up for f 1:17 f was happy 1:20 l hits f 1:22 o hits n 1:30 f teared out a semicolon gem 1:31 n teared out a question mark gem 1:32 The ampersand gem 1:34 f kept the semicolon gem 1:35 n kept the question mark gem 1:37 n helped f 1:41 f and n trips g 1:42 n hugged p 1:44 n remembers p helped him 1:47 n dropped the exclamation mark gem 1:50 p kisses n 1:52 f and n went to the cave 1:55 f and n hugged each other as besties 2:03 z was happy to see f and n being friends again 2:07 z went to sleep 2:11 The End
So Z is basically a supergiant alphabet that can reverse time?
1:16 F sounds cute I can BEARly stand it!🥺
Anyone else shipping F and N?! Just me? Kay.....
For Now thats all, just peak of abc verse, good story, good animation, all good.
Z was literally like: N A H I’m just gonna rewind time so there’s a happier ending Q: nah ima just give N The? I just spit out of my mouth N:holy cra- * literally swallows it* N: *in the past* N’s pov: *wait does that mean I can actually help F this time :O*
One like equals one Health to f 👇
people the Q and the N the Q made that the N that's why the N chose F 0:22
And plus: theres so MANY NUMBER LORES DO YOUR OWN
I want a Numbers Lore pls because they making fanmade ones pls do one or else F goes to your room and eats you
Fun   0:04
If you actually saying the last vid that from the past N couldn't stood up for F and going to L,M,O once f get to his cave and he lost his friends and his best friend N who helped him and betrayed F and F was uppercase and start capture the letter D,E,I,R,S he wasn't get N at all at the end N grab the dropen gem that F has left at the end he got all the gem and shot F in Q give a question to tell something that F wasn't Evil from the past he was kind and helped him spell kind word like Friends and O,L start shot N in the face and he bullyed and F stood for N and N was a little fine and F take revenge of the prank to help him spell fart after that L start confusing and kick off F and O capture letter With Rick and L psuh F to Rick To make him spell the most forbidden word Frick anyone is disgusted and team beaten F and J use ball to blast his teeth broken and N was accidentally flip him over and N couldn't do it he was coward a whole time that why F was sad and getting revenge.  From the previous vid The question show the F wasn't Evil everyone was realized he was a good old friend from the past. Z use the time gem to to return back to the past and Q give N a question mark to let him know everything when F filp over N in black dark room and N think what he going to do next when N saw a word coward he not going to join L,M,O as well N decide to stood up for F and he not joining L,M,O anymore and N Near F , F saw anything N wasn't there he was behind F . F was happy that N helped F too and they both got beaten like they not care when they both beaten and F was happy to see his best friend N again so F won't attack another letters and anything else F and N going to F cave and happiness and N come back to P and he know P stood up for N So he give an "!" Mark and P give N A one Kiss before going to the cave with F and now the time is peaceful and Z is happy F was N best friend that the story of alphabet lore.

I just wish F was not evil for all of this.
It was sad tho, all the letters were depressed and its emotional, Everyone knows F is not the bad guy, He just wanted friends and love😞😞
Elemento upi
J hi 7
To be honest, I kind of feel bad for F, He lost all of his friends. So this is the perfect ending we all needed🥲🥲🥲
Omg you maded for us thansk  dude i love F
Z was making the alphabet not die so Q and Z had a plan to restart the story

But uhh
The good ending is true!
2:07 cute
Hey Mike, Can you make more videos?
1:58 Z Happy Ending
Berulang
Me gustó el alfabeto eres muy bueno pero la imagen zzzfnp))))),
This ending is so epic,¡thanks mike salcedo!
I love you keep it up
I like very much the person of M also. Because if I guess, M was not originally bad, but during childhood M became bad because it was easy to incite M to the bad way, to the "Club of L & O". But unlike L and O that are psychopathic, M has normal feelings and emphaty and during Alphabet Lore M grieves when some letter dies. If you remember, when F mauled C to pieces and caused the death of P with mauling her face, M was very sad after those events. And in beginning of this epilogue, M seems like sad because of hearing that innocent F died and M was partly guilty of that because M was easy person to incite to the bad way of L and O that bullied F and N during alphabets' childhood. And M also realises that M is not really bad and begins to think: "Why did I need to join with L and O that were the real antagonists of the story?" So M was really regretting that he joined with L and O that were the real antagonists of the story.
End ;!
If you put it on slow motion around 0:09 you can see f alive on his cave
🥲🥲🥲
Voice 44 from soup earth society's number lore

Mike idk if you know but i see many apps games ect profiting off of this now idk if you have them permission but I just want you to be aware
0:17 0:10 0:39 0:27 0:02
So I guess what happens to F, that's the the fate of Z, and Z holds the  Power of the hole alphabet.
iiiiii.  No. 2023
Ad wasn't never watched it was recording yet on 3:79
This was a better ending
I Like when baby n stood up for Baby f and be happy with each other
Aqui los que no se pierden videos de Mike Salcedo
¿Open a second  part?
N you live withf
That’s is after nZ?
Why is F so  Evil
❤❤❤❤❤❤it’s so sad
Even though he has no gem
As P is very beautiful to letters and runs fast like Wonder woman does and G can be brave in his own rights
And X is the boy who would take on what monster is in the film as the Y is scared of the monster being a female letter
Y especially because poor Y is already scared of those Words and is likely the girlfriend in movies from 60 - 80's where the girl isn't very brave and every monster seems to scare it
(°=°)
And how F felt he didn't want other letters to know
Seeing F already he cared about the three
N happens to know and decided to not let other letters become bind
For pilgrim's the letters would be gulping
Y too busy to see she's next to A and A is next G
Nay
May

Que linda historia
F end N
1:32 fun fact the ampersand was the 27th letter of the alphabet, in the 19th century I believe, The ending would go “W, X, Y, Z and, per se, &” pronounced “and per se and“ The ending got strung together and became AMPERSAND.

This is aculy look like the normal alphabet lore when n blast F watch that part thats simuler
❤❤❤
Я всё ещё думаю о том... Неужто N мог забыть, что они с F были друзьями... Неужели он мог просто убить его..  Хотя друзьями они толком побыть не успели) и + чужое мнение, и все о нём потом подзабыли (  Но всё равно... Видеть финальную сцену первой части, где N и F, которые в конце стоят счастливыми друзьями... А здесь F лежит рядом с N убитый и растерзанный... Очень жëстко, на самом деле(..
And z is so cute when hes slepping

This video added by a game names fnf tje first song is friends second song is coward and the third is alphabet night funkin and the last is friday night funkin vs A
It makes sense that z fell asleep at the end is because you could be Z'ing when you are sleeping. A lot of effort into this. Thanks for having a heartwarming ending, now N is not a coward anymore. I also can't believe Z's power was revealed because the ellipsis was used to reverse time completely and are even moons.

Soo.. its FxN cannon now?? Did they have kids or somethin? Both endings are fine tho. This is pretty nice!
I actually cried❤
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY and Z I Love Z and P❤
My grandma and cousin loved it! Like this video
If anyone didn't know this already THIS IS CONNETED TO ALPHHABET LORE but why? well because Mike Salcedo said that alphabet lore was unfinished like for example you can watch alphabet lore and then watch this right after.                                                                                         (these people making alphabet good ending and bad endings from this and normal alphabet lore are dumb)
welp Lowercase Z is Now Cannon
Number lore ?
Z: goes to sleep while having a blue ring circle him.  The other letters: 😱😱😱   N: ? Q: K Y O O O O O O O O O O
kAy
Probably the best ending I ever seen compared to the other one.
Mike Salcedo, can you do Alphabet Lore (Credits) Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me plz?

Q gives Mike Salcedo the power to voice number 44 for number lore
I knew the ... weren't just an end
f and n became friends ☺️
とても良い👍
summary: Instead of killing all the letters, F’s main goal in the series was to kidnap all the letters in “friends” (possibly to spell the word). This is because F was friends with the letters in “friends” but it almost ended because of L & O’s bullying. Once they managed to hurt N, F got payback on L&O by spelling “fart” but that only started to make F the target for bullying. L then pushed F together with R I C and K to spell a (so-called) swear word with O getting everyone’s attention. This had made all the letters hate F and thus hurt him continuously. To me, N was just there when F tripped and didn’t mean to trip him but the problem was that he betrayed F because he was a “coward” (linking back to W’s introduction) this made F cry those Punctuation Gems and separate himself from the other letters. Lastly, when Q ate the question mark, he saw what had happened in the future and tried to warn the other letters but was just too slow.  Another thing to note: Each of the Punctuation Gems have a superpower: Period - Freezes Someone Comma - Makes time slower Colon&Semicolon - Forces letters together Exclamation Point - Super Speed Asterisk (*) - Duplication  Question Mark - Seeing the future THIS IS NOT COPY AND PASTED.
Now all we need is a baby alphabet lore version
Happy Ending
this is not rlly a good ending i suggest u remake the good ending and the ending in l and o died and everyone lives happily after that
Where the frick is Next time won't you sing with me?
I started crying when F just wanted friends but I'm so glad Z got everything back in time so N can change everything I'm so glad 🫂🥲

Q and Z are the REAL HEROS
The lowercase z looks kinda cool than the UPPERCASE one
2:05 is z chubby
What’s the next video?
Is there gonna be a number lore by you. If it’s not I think I might know why. Here is the reason: Because there is already a number lore by soup (One of my favourite YouTubers btw) already made a number lore. But I’d like to see another one though.
Well at least the future would be changed. But I still wish L & O got some sort of punishment for framing F.
0:03 If you look at the letters G, A, and Y, then you’ll realize that it spells the word g*y!
Once you truly watched the full series, there's no love for it anymore.
L and o is gonna be the villains and n knows the future in one eye there's f getting bullied and the other eye there's f killing them so z reversed  and that shows up n knew and that's why z reversed time for n to make a good discussion so there's another alphabet lore coming soon ...
f and n is so cute 😍 I can't  stop  crying
you  know what z is so cute
What do you think about the current fanbase, Mike?

My son had an issue at school today. He struggles with social situations but stuck up for a friend and was subsequently teased for it. He watched this over and over and I saw tears. He came out and said he wanted to have a meeting with those kids and to watch the video with them, but to cut out the ending. 🤣❤❤thank you for helping my son process his emotions in his own way. Talking to mom was not enough on this one.

Tysm for making this ending
The best way to top this amazing animation off is a sequel to this where F and N are friends and maybe the numbers can be introduced. And just like L, M, N, O, P, Q, X and Z; some numbers could have punctuation gems for powers that were missed like “, -, and others. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 should be the only numbers introduced because numbers are infinite.)
The alphabet lord made me cry😊
S s!!ss!!d
Good ending:)
Why is f so evil
Y is f so evil
my is carin
my man mike i knew q was going to be a big part in the story line because he was following everyone around
0:01 very own question mark
Yes happy Z friends f and N☺❤
Why was G uppercase In the sequel they went back in time so he was a lowercase why was he shown as uppercase when he went back in time?
Where's apostrophe? Apostrophe's a letter too!
i love M and N and F and Z
Очень и очень круто, а главное познавательно!
ñ??????
Третий раз смотрел и все время не много плачу
Want it
Sorry i must be end the Sub my brother will it
Now f has a friend
This still seemed incomplete bcoz we need "Next time won't you sing with me" to finish the ABC song. And I imagine L and O not being friends anymore, O now being friends with everyone, primarily F and N. Then, time gets fast forwarded, and N uses his rainbow blast to destroy L once and for all.
f a hero
L O M муухай

Thanks to Z, Z was a god all along thanks to him he used his (...) elipsis to reverse time, and didn't know that Q have powers whitout the gems or simply the ? Gem. Q did give N the symbol gem for N  remembering all the story about the villians L and O and how they injured and cause chaos to F, N knows that F wanted "FRIENDS" back because he was harmed and hated of all the letters ( exept for Q didnt do anything) and especially R,I,E,N,D and S, so n Decided to get back for revenge to Find his friend f. There was tears of joy and happines of f and n being toggether now  N finally is not a coward
0:03 ¿?
Now we need the aftermath of this
Wiat f was £ I just realized

Ok they should make alphabet lore part 3 so that's what happened F and n get revenge on L and O
The ending we got vs the ending we wanted!!!
Вообще-то знаете что всё это началось из-за L и O.Они настоящие злодеи.
Hi Mr.Mike (im just not THAT sure to call you Mike) I really loved the end, but i have a question. What happened to F and N? Have they started a new relationship? What about the other letters? Can you do a third part to explain all of that?
Q Z more like control Z
Now I'm questioning, Does F not turn evil, or do both of them become evil?
Thank You For Helping Everyone Without Dying Z!
Thank You Q &Z!
Ffff Ffcf Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffff Rrrr Ffff

Hi. I’m live in South Korea. My son is 6years olds and he likes Alphabet Lore very much. Do you have plan to make educational contents about learning English and Phonics. I hope so. Alphabet Lore is very popular in South Korea. I think it’s gonna big business if you make that contens. Thank you ❤
❤❤❤❤❤🎉😊
LETS GOOO THE SERIES IS OVER
so hart warming
fortnite
I thought either U was going to join F and N (so they could have FUN together), or that I would join them and the final shot would show "FIN" (as in French for "end," not part of a fish).
Lowercase Z Is here!!!
THE ONLY LETTERS LEFT: MUGANYQLOK
I would like you to create a alphabet lore 3.

Bang bikin lagu alfabet loret
lmao wat
This is no clickbait , Z is just making n be with f
This is the first time I see you z what’s a baby
😍😍😍😍😍😘
É muito legal saber que aconteceu o final feliz,o Z se sacrificou para voltar ao passado. E o Q,deu a N o ?,que serve para ele lembrar do que iria acontecer se ele fosse amigo de L,M e O,então,ele foi ser amigo de F,pois é ele que o valorizou de verdade,F não queria o mal,ele só queria amigos,por isso ele sequestrou as letras necessárias,e matou aquelas letras que empidiu ele de cumprir o objetivo. Q estava indo atrás das letras para mostrar o flashback e deixar F quieto,mas ele chegou tarde demais. L e O são os verdadeiros vilões,pois eles que deixaram F naquela situação,mas a intenção do L era bullynar N,mas F se vingou e foi cisto como um maldito. Z está até rachado de tanto ver guerra entre as letrar e saber que existem letras que deixaram de existir,então,Z usou suas energias vitais para voltar ao passado,e no final,? pertence ao N,e o ; virou um cristal para F,e depois de resouver tudo,Z consegue seu descanso eterno...
sad  is 😭

Yay good endinig
N kill f cus he was sorry what he do in the future in a flashback too when go with f helping him better life
best end
Fogger and all of 50th 7days is a little too high right
I think the reason why L and O are the bad guys is because there's actually an English word "lo" which gives the meaning "used to draw attention to an interesting or amazing event"
1:11 LYDIA: JESSICA?...
The word FRICK is not for kids
Wow great job making this video!!!!
Secrets about Alphabet lore: GAY
g:아니 난 무슨죄냐고! 그리고 난왜 3번 씩이나 밟는데!
n:o 는 사실 나 때렸던 애야 l 도 착한녀석 은 아니야
Q has mostly the answer why F is trying to hurt all the letters except Z. They think Q is just helpless and they are trying to figure out to stop the fight, if they listened to him then they will find the answer why…
I think why q and z saved them cuz they were very unused
Q bonito el final
Alphabet lore is really dark than l think by myself
f and n were friends
Q:Qyooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
Good ending
Now playing The Last Thing You Heard.
Z literaly got oof
Plz prt 3 with no lore
ZƏĒĘÑĒŇĐ
Now F and N are gonna beat up the others
Y la z es re poderosa
La z quieos un final feliz
abc     a-z
I think Z is a world 2 reasons  1. When Z uses his tears is doesn’t go spread it goes over Fs cave  2. Q and Z have something in common. Q showed everyone a flash back and Z can make things right by going back in time. Not trying to get others to believe just want to bring my thoughts up have a good day 😊😊😊
LORE OF Ñ?

you forgot lowercase joke z
WE DID IT, GAMERS, WE GOT THE GOOD ENDING
Z was like nah I want F too be happier
❤️❤️
Q was to talk the meaning and N and the gems ? Q was like what.
Este video pone una moraleja
0:22 Worse than in this scene when Q looks at N the power of F (The question mark) ends up going to N in the same second... Magic?
My theory is that the eclipse or ... has the power to change the past completely changed the events of the original Alphabet Lore.
Wait a second, this was a anti-bullying series all along
Z
...
goob
someone noticed that the thumbnail said gay 💀
Wait the symbols that they shared n and f will maybe be sneak peek of symbol lore my mike scaldo

You see in alphabet lore there are the main 26 letter first we have A he is red, red sus, A sus. Then B it is spelled B-E-E yet this man is a butterfly. Next C no one Cares about C beCause he got killed by F, along side B Bieng Chewed. Then we have D D is uhh-*D bieng beat up by F*. Uhhhh ok. Then we have E a te-*E being beat up by F*. Ok. Well F seems like the villain he actually is very nice boi cause major plot twist: L O evil😈😈😈😈. Then we have G he just straight up shoots his crush P resulting in his 1minute emotional effect of him saying G GG G GG GGGGGGGG. H is ghost. I is smol boi. J i-*J gets obliterated*. BRO. Then K he is basically a bee/moth/who cares. L=Evil11!1!1!1!1👿. M=Mean1!1!1!1!1!1👿. N=Sweet lil baby who ends up saving da Z planet😇. O=Evil1!1!1!1!1!👿. P is ho- I mean pink and super like all the other letters of LMNOP but DIES😶. Q is a snail who ends up force feeding N a f*cking gem so that he can save earth. R is a f*cking coward that gets kidnapped. S is a god dang emo (who gets kidnapped)(Wait he's A snake). T is also a animal specifically a hammer-head shark. U is U. V is also a f*cking coward. W is in a black void but at the same time is not. X using the his Discord mod knowledge of anime to duplicate himself AND DIES. Y screams WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Basically bieng the only letter so talk normal english. Z is a planet.  That is the ultimate recap of alphabet lore.
I love baby z

I want seison 2 now! Pls.
next: greek alphabet lore, or spanish alphabet lore, where A's The Villain.... He Suddenly Begins Acting Like F, But When He Bites I.. He Goes Physco With His Eyes Turning All Red, A Bites I Violently By Squeezing Him Like A Killer, A Out Of Control One... I Gets Cut in Half With blood splattering on e and d, terrified, they run away, k l m n all become heroes but lose the battle, and get mauled like the others.. the letters from the English alphabet lore see this crisis.. Nye, Comes To Help. Nye Suddenly Transforms into enye. and pulls out his sword and they start fighting, enye gets stabbed, and makes a sacrifice to the spanish letters by stabbing him before it's too late.. A Cuts enye In Half. and becomes a literal monster and kills the other letters trying to defeat him.. Z Has Had Enough of This.. he opens a mystic portal which blasts a laser at A, And Changes Time..

I want too know what the gender of all the alphabet lore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbPKSD5BQ1o
Þe Þeory of Alphabet
When I watch the fist episode is like really interesting and heartness in my head and my dreams and now when I watch the second episode it explain so much about it now I know the truth about this; so in the first episode like man is so sad and the stars are not between each other anymore and cheerfulness of the heart and the planet Z  but now look at Z when he was being his balls around himself he make a giant ball and the ball is called TRUTH look when the second episode comes it tells you the TRUTH about everyone that all around his madness can't feel himself and his heart and his love he just needed him and the people on the planet to not fight all around the world and the one that know's all about it is F why ; F know the planet can't even feel himself when we keep fighting and harming each other around the solar system and now the full system don't have power the only power he has is broken heart  🌌💖💕🤧🥺😭💯💫💞💓💕💗💖💘💝❤️💔💦😖😩😫😣😥😓💌 And thank you for you and one last thing the people who never died or helpful and cheerful
& is in the alphabet it's like this abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy&z
rip z
It would be amazing if the added number lore

Mike Salcedo! Soup Earth Society Wants You To Voice 44!
0:10 and 1:58
I’m starting to cry for the happy ending🤤      😂
alphabet lore is SO SAD.
is "Z" a girl or a boy???
No one talking about how it looked like F was trying to spell "Friends"
I'm not going to take care of F
there is no "FIN" without F and N
At the beginning it says friends
Bro even as a lower case letter Z sounds like he hit puberty 12 times
Here no more?
At Z in end: happy😇
Y z está feliz
n salvó a f
❤
Do the next vid!
the oi though
YOU GOTTA VOICE 44 FOR SOUP EARTH SOCIETY

0:18 ByTheWay
Mike can you do a seires called alphabet lore tales they will be 120 second-long post-epilogue episodes  about alphabet lore (the letters need to be uppercase) and have 26 episodes of the seires (because of 26 letters) and at the end of each episode it will zoom out to see Z (each episode must be different) can you start making this series once you read this comment
So cute 🥰
why f while sitting is like £
I feel that Z was brave enough to erase his memory for all the others, even thought he can't remember anything, it was the correct choice for him to be like the Z we know today.
대박
So passive-agressive
I want to be a party 3 in the studio he just called
Q was like: 🏃💨
0:18 who saw the "B T W" (by the way)

My son is currently obsessed. I just love this story of how you just set yourself this challenge to do a new illustration every day and this was one of them and then this has happened! It's literally everywhere! I was wondering if you're getting any royalties?? I hope so, cos there is merch and Roblox merch etc etc everywhere! All using your IP
KYOOOOOOOO
Wouldn't F and N start another revenge but N will be on F's side?
Z는알파뱃친구들에게 시간돼돌렷다진짜재미었다

It reminded me of infinity war and adventures endgame this kind of
In this household we love and respect F, N, Q, and Z!
Who else wants to see a video from Mike of the life they'd have in the present or maybe even a series of all the Alphabet lore letters.
0:22 Q's eyes had me dead🤣

Why is the letter Z cracked?

Ñ
Why do you like better so much maybe oh I know you better you just better make a further video that colour lol
😄
Stockholm is in Sweden
Do you live in Sweden???
@Mike Salcedo do you plan on doing anything else with this series, or is this the whole thing? If so, two things: 1: can you possibly add subtitles, so that we can understand more clearly what each letter is saying, and 2: can I possibly add on to the canon timeline? Because I have some interesting ideas to add numbers into the equation. (Pun intended.)
FN☺
Very sad ending. 11/10 Story.
It's so interesting
When will there be a new Alphabet lore video again
I love how F lost his eye balls
N and F

Oh my God that was a happy ending ever actually evil so now when he when they grow up and it will be nice because and has the Magic Stone that have to do everything with everything to have to do it after being evil you always noted I thought you was actually the dumb character because you actually was slow he was actually slow because cute I have to say cute it's pretty slow but you actually knew what happened I love you cute but just don't give me a kiss okay
Imagine how small they are compared to Z
Imagine how small they are compared to Z
F became a villain because his friend N betrayed him similar to stygian from FIM as he also became a villain because his friends betrayed him luckily n travelled back in time to fix his mistake and they both became friends again also similar to stygian as he and the pillars became friends again after they realised their mistake and apologised to him

0:22 KYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO *N swallows the whole gem*
i didnt know this video that this video is the acttuly the real video
Theeeeeeed
Hebrew version:   Alef <- A  Bet <- B  Gimel <- C  Dalet <- D  He <- E  Vav <- F  Zayin <- G  Khet <- H  Tet <- I  Yod <- J  Kaf <- K (forming to Kaf Sofit while Tav rolls time backwards to the childhood)  Lamed <- L (first superhero)  Mem <- M (second superhero, forming to Mem Sofit)  Nun <- N (third superhero, forming to Nun Sofit)  Samekh <- ??? (fourth superhero)  Ayin <- O (fifth superhero)  Pe <- P (sixth superhero, forming to Pe Sofit)  Tsade <- Q (forming to Tsade Sofit while telling why Vav became evil)  Qof <- T  Resh <- X  Shin <- Y  Tav <- Z    I needed to give to letters "unlogical" pairs because there are just 22 Hebrwe letters and plot would suffer too much, if they were absolutly correct _(for example Zayin <- Z)._ But maybe Hebrew version could come?
1:49 N's face looks disturbing
N & F bff
🥰🤗😊
Z is actually the good guy cause when F was evil he Z and Q worked together so that N would go with F and he wouldn’t be evil
Lomas de la solicitación crees tú me gustó fue el que cuando yo y cómo se llama cuando la vida de este
Hi Mike Salcedo, The Z is a  planet?
z: 2:03 My lower case version is on "nZ" Comments
If I have a child this is what I'm going to show them to help them learn the alphabet
10-100
I am convinced that Z is a cosmic being among the alphabet lore cinematic universe bro. Like he became a diety and turned back time bro.
I pause the video where the F. I laughed so hard he look 😂
Yes
This is beautiful  It’s also made me cry 😢
would you like to do "number lore"?
But there is a best ending better than this one right 🤔?
: ; . , ! ? * and ...
l and o are dum
This man deserves to have an oscar, he is Awesome at making animations!
ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ
L and O is really the villains not F
This is the good ending of Alphabet Lore
I hope afterwards N and F return to the other letters becoming friends with them again and L and O becoming the outcasts they deserve to be
Soo this the fix the problem
Please make a SERIES
Mad n 0:58
0:09 music?
AMIGOSFN

The special ending￼
1:08 i see h fly
He should literally make a series where he shows lowercase alphabet lore. With all the letters and it finish with the betrayal of f and n. But n had the question mark so still a good ending for this series.
rip F
And also if you pause when n looks down he looks like uppercase N
I laughed when f did do a silly mouth
Guys if you pause when they are zooming out we can see another F
Now we need Reverse Alphabet Lore, where F is making everything right by bringing his dead people back to life and freeing R, I, E, D and S
Why did I get an ad for a knockoff alphabet lore game when I clicked on this video
Genial
0:14 Z do Control+Z to undo

F+N^⁠_⁠^ityru itu ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
Z AND Q MUST HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER
I like how little N faced his fears against the bigger guys and stood up for himself for the first time now he gets to have a good life with his new best friend
Oh?
So the z power is reset time
aww f and n are cute
So funny
2:00 just a replay of baby z

Z baby
What was Z's Moon's Name
z is so cute when he as a kid

m's my you i bye
my ok i no'
alphabet lore a-z,
I like the twinkle twinkle little star it makes the music about twinkle twinkle little star also it’s very sad but now I know my ABC’s is happy
why...
We all know that, its sad. But Do you guys see "GAY" in the beginning?
Did anyone else cry when N stood up for F? Seriously, it's enough to make a grown man cry.
Could you try to make a number lore 1-26 maybe?
I love how you get to see baby Z
The first ending was with F dying 😢 but now the ending is so cute
Alphabet lore shuffle: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=leAVvs9ejxM
0:22 me when I blink
Wow
if F isn’t still getting sharp teeth when he grows up, we got a problem.
f and n are so cute
Make another video about alflabet lore I know I spelt that wrong
Creator of Alphabet Lore made this he showed us the TRUE ending
Mike Salcedo, please, I know its incredibly rare for you to see this comment, but im gonna try my luck anyways. So theres this youtuber called lankybox. He is a absolute trash money farm that makes more money than a soviet factory. He produces a million clickbait videos a day, and he decided to make all his videos a clickbait video with alphabet lore, and he is not even crediting you. Do something, like idk, file a dmca copyright strike, copyright all his videos, or find a way to file multiple dmca strikes. Please, this will not only help you, but millions of people. I hope my word goes trough, and you use my advice.
What happened after this vid: O realizes what he has done, and L grows up from a bully to a villain like F (because of L meaning loser irl) and he tries to commit more genocide than F did. But F is smart and knows how to steal gems at the first place because he is the owner of the ; gem.
02:03
BTW did you see BTW
I saw another F at the top.
One act of time travel decided if F lived or not
Alto cringe me mori
Wfgilp🏳😮
My name is Fanta- f and n are besties and are meh
If you stop at 0:10 you will see F is still alive
I actually wonder what would have happened if F actually did capture N, probably would play out as F brings N to the cave, N shakes violently scared slowly opening his eyes to see F who makes a side gesture and he sees them all their spelling FRIENDS, N would stop feeling scared and the two have a heart to heart with one another eventually working things out F feels guilty for what he did so him and N go and confront everyone else. They all realized their mistake (besides O and L) thats when F wishes for someway to fix all of this that's when Q slides in saying there might be(with the power of the.? Gem he knows about Z) saying they need to inquire another friends help. The ones who survived all join together all Simulatonsly saying their names and thats when Z does the time reverse, Q of course giving N the Gem so he'd remember and be able to make things right
F is not the bad guy L and I is the bully
F sad now😢
Incredible
NUMBER LORE NEXT
I love that you put this video in this and this one because it was the best thing I ever saw
Happy ending
The  wrost bad ending is Z gets broken and the colors are warning the F cave also her cave destroyed and F wants to leave P from G... And F with the black liquid make Z more unhealthy Z: It isnt worked... ¡OUCH! ¡OUCH!  HELP ME IM BROKE!  F: For you i save you to eat you seriously...  N: ¡AND GIVE ME BACK MY POWER!  M: ¡ME TOO! L: ¡AND ME!  O: ¡AND ME!  P: ¡AND ME!  A: HELP WE GOING DOWN SOON!  B: PLEASE!  X: My heart is going under attack!  Y: I dont wanna leave my friend X!  T: Please one can help me to get up of this stone?  U:???  W: Please dont let me down F!  F: NEVER! Z: Im sorry guys, you are late to help to get more happy, now you are going to die...  Q: NO W: NO E: NO R: NO T, Y, U, I, O, P, A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L,X, C, V, B, N, M: NO WHY?!  Z: Too late, goodbye...  ALL DIES
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

ThomasMinis
True ending Ty Q and Z
It made me cry!
https://youtu.be/wSuBdHyViO4 Russian alphabet lore exists and this is there discord
I just thought of something crazy, it was Q that threw the question mark thing to N, so this could be the idk how many times it reversed, bc what if Q reversed so many times already but just never get to stop them in time? is it possible if time already reversed so many times and this is the one last time bc Q finally got there on time?
You’re lying I subscribed and liked you but this guy just rebuild your alphabet lore nonsense it’s just that the letter Z what is trapping every letter in the alphabet lore into his zoo! And when G formed a cab a didn’t even do anything he is just lying in the car when I was protecting them the letter I was just doing the wuw face
해피엔딩
The alphabet lore end is sad and happy
In Year 2064: 😔 In Year 2022: 😊
F
Glad that Z did something that was made F feel so much better
2052 - 2022.
N in theories is just trying to stop F from causing more genocide

ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ
I turned down the speed and when the transition to z was happening i saw F just standing there in the mouth of the f cave
I know I’m late (saw the video within the first few hours) but bro the letters screwed up so bad that their own home planet (and probably Q) had to fix everything for them 💀
Falta la ñ
Befor i saw this i was gonna make my own "good ending" so now That you made this i have a question can i make my ending?
I like your videos and the only video I would like from you is a good ending of Alphabet lore and the original alphabet lore And can you put alphabet Lore three pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee I always go to school and one of my friend know your videos how many days would it take to make your two videos you made is a Alphabet Lore and a good ending how much days did you made this video card alphabet lore (a-z) ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Can you see the pilot of the Alphabet Lore?
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Everyone: *sad* Z: with the power of stinky bubbles, comes infinite power!!!!!! Q who looks like a meme: Idk what I'm doing Z: *his dumb bubbles blocking the entire alphabet lore* N: umm how did that come out of my eyes Z: you're just a tilted version of me so like you're stinky N: why does everyone bully me :< F: *trips over bucko* EEEOWOWAAA F: why, N, why LMO: well we just came out of nowhere *some black screen with N on it* N: I'm alive but I'm dead N: *thinking about stuff* N: *thinks about the dead letters spelling out coward* N: I will be an idiot but for now I'll just walk past G or F or whoever LO: we randomly came out of nowhere again -M: what about me- *randomly the real world now* F: :woozly_face: LO: you will not have fun and will get slapped N: I have a purple eye!1!1!1!1!11 F: _I can't even tell what that face is.mp4_ FN: we are now friends again N: *always thinking about stuff* N: *p-p-p!* P: -understandable,- have a nice day Z: *being the world but happy* I'm glad my planet has been protected -(not really)-
Next time wont you sing with me... (everyone knew about l and o's evil intentions and decided to stop them)
This proves why I don’t like l and o🤬
Pause quickly at 0:10 and F is still on top of the cave.

Finally he gave us this ending
X: bruh wheres my gem

Z is so cute in the end
Normal people when hear alphabet lore:oh that was old alphabet?  Me when hear alphabet lore:😭😭😭😭😭  Edit: oh yeah and the most letters that call himself is X:265 P:84 (iforgot)  G:28

Porque la n se come la jema
2:03 baby z should be orange
Lowercase G just fell
The fact that the gems that they cried out were tears of happiness this time ❤
It’s cute how N is not strong enough to fight LMO but still stayed with F
0:10 the alphabet and Z is gonna transform into lowercase
That almost made me cry 😭 This is the most beautiful and heartwarming thing ever...
I wonder why z still has a deep voice even do hes young
La z c duerme por que es zzzzz XDDDD

I want a continuation to this, I’m actually imagining nice F right now. Seriously!
We need to see F and N fight against L and O THAT WOULD BE EPIIICC!!!
I see a mistake F in the start was died in he's cave but if you put 0x25. When the cave's show out pause and see up you can see F not died
The alphabet isnt just taught to kids, it also shreds a tear through an eye.
fgfgfgfgfgfgfff
There is F in the cave still alive I saw F standing on her Fr cave like top thingy
Keep going!
Next is number, pls i want to see more

Its good ending?
who the f*ck thinks F is evil? so you see the Bad ending in this right? the ending where F dies  The fact 5 year olds thinks f is evil  L and O are the real villains They bullied N and F and Putted F in rick to spell "frick"  Before you ask that "why F killed J and i,X,P,C,B,D,E,S,T then you dumb" Cuz F accidently aimed at J on i,s Ball that lets him shoot F Pretended as P F Bite,s X F Bites C,B F swallowed S F Kills T  F is the Real Innocent cuz he became crazy cuz of L and O F is not his fault
I think they're going back and time
HÔ  QUA Anh QUên Làm        ,. Vi Đeo CHU Z                                kí tên

Yey
Number Lore Pls
Mad respect for Q and F, Q swallowed the ? gem and saw the future, so he tried to warn everyone but was too slow to catch up with them, all the letters became uppercase and Q gave N the gem so N can remember F’s backstory. Props to the creator for making this.

Hi
Z: *procceds to sleep*
Anyone else bullet to f and lmo was angry to f the z is probably popular planet fitness and good  and letter N was the only one letter to kill the letter f 🙏
Oh, so now that F and N are friends again, is there going to be a new generation of Alphabet Lore coming soon?
What happens to n and f are day going to turn evil
Jejejdehwi2ve
I found this thing . When you see B,T And W shadow when Z is reversing time. There shadows are fixed. Look at B shadow. His wings are broken but his shadow shows that it’s perfectly fine
0:30 i: WHO IS CALLING ME SMOOSH?
I am working on an aphabet lore comic on my channel i dont know when it will be finnished

Theory in the last video we see that Z's tear is spheres and we see that they were two and turned into three so what to say that it is the fourth time that Z is sad but also the first time that he is happy

Alphabet lord it’s the best
They weren’t Z is the bad guy the literal planet, he’s restarting the alphabet world
your missing some alphabet letters its Å Ö Ä
Wouldn't it be awesome to have one where it shows like a small backstory to ALL the letters including J who got killed right when it was introduced and maybe why L is always mean.
You are gonna make me cry
THIS SHOULD HAVE A PART THREE THIS IS PUR ART
Your video is freaking exciting. It inspired me to make a cardboard maze with these Alphabet for my hamster to play 🥰
The good ending

Весь мир стоит на букве Z. Z на листке бумаги.

Top ten anime endings:
Hey Mike saldido can you make number lore it's will be amazing
🤩
I say btw means by the way
FN❤️❤️❤️
Here's all the characters names btw A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   also I missed out on a letter try to find it
N, Q and Z were like the main heroes
Z , N and F are by far the most overpowered characters I have seen  F has the ability to grant , take abilities and even make abilities themselves (might be able to see the future) N has basically all the abilities same as F and can make abilities as his tears were able to make P's power gem thing Z can literally rewind time
1:55 So Cute When They Look Us!! 🤗
No one is going to ask how p chest heads butts the car and n because she has no arms
Mike Salcedo can you make number lore
I just had a thought if z could reverse time all along then... How many times has he reversed time before?
g o d
please make a part 2
I like baby Z more than all the other letters
Wait when we zoom out of the cave we can see F on the top of his cave! even though he’s dead
So many people died
A happy ending🥹🥹
Do number lore now
Ns so funny he's like get out of my way
Good ending😊😊
Some people said they want to see number lore🙏
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I thought Z was born first
You did not expect this to get so popular have you.
And did nothing wrong he was a good good good good good good good good of a bedwetter
you maked you maked all the youtube make cringe videos of alphabet lore because of you creator of alphabet lore you ruined my life
This is the true ending
Will you ever make content of other stuff? Just wonderin
The end had me crying, even tho I can’t see. But who cares? That ending was perfect! Like all the other ones.
I watched, amazing work,i never thought I'd see this amazing ending, keep up the work!
What was F and N doing there at the end? It looked a lot like they were exchanging their version of-
So is P Ns Mom ?
dododo dun do dun
This a masterpiece the whole lore
Happy z:)
What the number lore
0:09
& was the 27th letter of the alphabet, and the epilogue is the 27th episode of the Series (and the last episode), so seeing that Easter egg is pretty much the most perfect was to go out with a bang.
Omg this mad me cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love how this ended, especially the fact about how we got bebeh (lowercase) Z!
Q just put  the ? In n.
I feel bad for baby f in The other story.

We NEED Ö to the show
No ablo inglish pero megusto

For the past

I didn't know that Z save everyone
X should have a sequel he is cool he just should have focused more against F he really would have won if he used his full power.
Z was the true Saviour

Wow😢
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Everybody thought the lore ended by F getting bullied, but then somehow the 2 most unused letters saved the day by working together. The man who made this is really amazing. Just, wow. Now I’m actually gonna use the 2 unused letters!     N is the true hero of this story.

Is Z the biggest letter in this series?  Bc F mountain is standing on top of Z's head.

I knew it would be a good ending than a bad ending but now I’m still puzzled can you make a video about that the good ending in the regular and then Betty that regular ending is not a good evening?
What would make this better if F I N A L and E all lined up at the end.
My question is how-do-you-do k voice
Weird part: Lower case f had ONE EYE??
Your the best
Yay
people are simping for letters because of you are you proud of yourself?  ARE YOU? YOU'VE RUINED THE FUCKING ALPHABET. DO YOU THINK IM FINE WITH THIS?  MIKE, DID YOU NOT KNOW THE FACT?  THE FACT THAT THERES ALWAYS A BAD SIDE TO LARGE COMMUNITIES? HUH? DID YOU KNOW? HMM??  im furious and i want to take my anger out on my nephew.  he's annoying as fuck. he thinks among us is funny. augh
If this is ‘Now I Know My ABCs…’ do you think there is going to be a ‘Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me?’ ?
I made alphabet lore but horrible
the most important thing is F and N stay friends forever ❤️
Dissss is so disturbing
este es el mejor final de alfabet
The endings are always the best parts
time has bean altered thanks from Z now everyone that died is now alive thanks to Q that gived the "?" to N so he can renember what hapened so F can be a good guy (an awesome ending)
part 2 g's revenge
fun fact: Z is the only letter where the alfabet stay on. Look at the end carefully!
Is it just me or did I not first realise that Z was the entire planet
Now I Know My 123... Number Lore: The Finale of Epilogue

Literally gave me a sense of closure
Good ending
Message for everyone in the future:   *IMAGINE SHIPPING LETTERS LOL YOUR MIND NEEDS TO BE SEEKED BY A THERAPIST* skjadhfklashdfjkhasdf In fact i've already seen N x F in the thumbnail of a video.  As someone who's name starts with an N, i'm dissapointed in humanity and i need bleach for my eyes. *RIGHT. NOW.* P.D: I'm not saying the ending was horrible,  i'm just saying that people with a problem in their minds see two characters look at each other (with their only interaction being that) and instantly make a drawing of them *KISSING*, that's my point.
NO SE PASA DE 123? number lore vs NO SE PASA DE ABC alphabet lore QUE LA Z VAN AHI POR ÉSTE DE PARISON
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🖤😢😢😢😢😢
F did nothing wrong.
I still don’t understand Z

This is the ending that we all wanted and we got it
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Episode 27:Epiloge (not a bad ending)
F
i got my own ending before N hits F with the rainbow beam N stops for a second and then F backs up as N saw rieds and then goes in the word before it happens V Y O and L shows up and beats F making N shotting F with the rainbow beam then F last tear drops before it happens then Z rewinds to where N is going into rieds  where N does not shot F this time but  F and N go into rieds to spell FRIENDS when everyone letter finds out why F was eating all the letter opps i meant kill and kidnapping they all forgived F and then they all were friends again
I know that the future is all good no death and f.r.i.e.n.d.s where friends

POV : your getting emotional because of F’s backstory
L and O is D U M
0:02 kinda good music what is it
#destroyLandO
I think n WAS scared to not join lmop so he joined it or maybe he will be executed by Zs emblem and thats why he got called a coward, this is for Simplayz btw
What’s next number lore

I love the new ending
Random fun fact: you can see all the letters in this that haven’t either died (c, p, x, j, and h) other than v. They are either all in the cave or you see them in the time reverse thing.
You know I found a mistake there's a second f
wow is so cooool!
You are a creative person I have to say
Im crying for alphabet
Q TRISTE😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢
f was never the bad guy but the other letters (besides n i think) made him the bad guy
N ? Q.      N? Q.           l n o.        l-f n-o.           F N
Remaking the epilog in coments
That ending show that Getting Beat Up Together it's the best way to get Freinds/Best friend
ERORR
E where😭
And also why does little z sound like adults Z
But L O M X P N don’t have their power anymore which is a good thing because they did nothing
OK but what about next time won’t you sing with me?
Thank you Mike Salcido
Omgg it makes me so happy seeing Z happy he is adorable and now he can go to sleep without worrying of them fighting Why is Z so cute in baby form
This is crazy bro
Quiero que en esta saga si sale una parte 2 una parte o solo está la parte 1 revives a todas las letras que la mató la f haciendo cómo se dice haber recuperado para creo que luego se muera un patrón diferente luna se mueren igual así
Hace una parte 2 por favor qué la mala sea la doble l y si este comentario te llega después de que hagas una parte 2 parte 3

Don't you know the last sentence in the song? It ends with next time won't you sing with me

My personaje favorito es la F

Make a bad ending for alphabet lore pls
Nobody is talking about how F remembered how each letter injured him, just so he could do it to them in the future as revenge, the Alphabet lore is very emotional...

I'm not crying I'm just sleepy.😢
FUN GAY
Ampersand (&)
the world will often leave you battered, ostracized, and taken advantage of. but the kindness of just four or so out of the twenty-five other characters arranged into the story around you can be the difference between a life of revenge, and a life that finds freedom from the cruelty.   while i still can't help but wish for L, and O to finally get the punishment they never received, Q Z N and P made a future without vengeance worth living. bravo, to the ending of a masterpiece.
Q: eat this N N: what is th- Q: (puts in Ns mouth)
(Turns tears very fast)
I'm Z 😢
F: I'll help you n^^ N: thanks f! The rings connect N: thanks p    N: Do you wanna hurt me? are you gonna hurt me?  Please don't desert me Please don't desert me I'm really fcked up f It was there fault Your the only innocent one To grab the villains! We're still friends right? F: yes N: thanks  LIEK FOR PART 2😆
K sounded like he needs more air
N: bro I'm so sorry Do you wanna hurt me? Are you gonna hurt me? Please don't desert me Please don't desert me
made me cry
A, F and N are my fave. oh! can't forget Z!😄
That greatest moment that N and F are innocent and the others aren't because now they became friends and the fact Z smiling 👍😄
I hope you can do can do more lore like russian alphabet lore,number lore,…
A - epilogue
This is a very good ending! *Happy tears* 🥲
This is so nice!
I think the fact that n saved f will prevent F to die and so others letter like c and p

the two most unused letters doing the most, the letters living a happy, carefree life, how wholesome. :)
Alternate title: How the Alphabet Lore Should Have Ended
What worries me is that they are starting to make so much garbage content and overexploit it, no kidding they literally appear like 18828921918376436372828 videos of this (I'm not saying that all Be bad but you know...)
0:22 i love Q
damn, this is so sad, in a happy way
this is a really sad story… (DONT SCROLL DOWN IF YOU DONT WANG SPOILERS!)        basically G will have regret for the rest of his life, because he killed P on accident.. and C making a sacrifice for the letters.. Z was very hurt and injured from stress. Q and Z were the only ones who knew the future , so Q and Z were working together to save the world. F was the nicest in the past (f) so f and n were actually friends, until l and o attacked n. f wanted to get his revenge, so they spelled the word “fart” to make l fart. it’s the reason that h is a ghost. It caused F to spell “frick”. Z actaully does something to save the world, by going back in time , And Q giving N the question mark. N makes a decent choice to help F.
Oh man that suspect me why is the Q has the gem ? I think its the whole timer of story (but not lowercase ones) this is why the Q follows us idk is it true
Abcdefn
WE NEED number lore and shape lore maybe even door lore why not!!!
"the Ene"
I can confirm that this will continue
imagine a small world is a baby and now its adult cause were adults
Number lore?
2:02 z
its 2 part
I was N and F have never became friends
The only death that happened is h because he died to the fart
The ending was so dumb
Also if you didn’t know Z is actually a planet
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺so cuuuuuuutttttttte

:}
Happy ending 😭😭😭😭
Helow
Take off the knowledge of alphabet lore.EXE
I'm glad that Q reset the time and remind the letters how nice F was.its was a great and happy ending
I just love this vid! It is so emotional. im also curious if there will be a Number Lore?
The good ending
Baby Z still has the deep voice
this is a true ending
U was edited in
Z is the best letter!
More alphabet lore pls
Burh
It was just amazing that Q and Z worked together to keep bad things from happening, to keep the world of alphabets stable and in peace for all

Acepto videos haces a parte 3 este video
?: n's wondering how the hell this worked. ;: It's not over for the dynamic duo (it is over onscreen though) !: Can't a guy show gratitude to someone because they helped them in the future by crying out a Sailor Moon reference in the shape of the exclamation mark, symbolising just how thankful they are?
Z look cool now :)
N is supposed to be the coward but was given the job to change history
EPIC😎😎
LOOL 0:09 other F
That's what you wanted to be n and f
We need an aftermath chapter because we need to learn how does little f obtained these punctuation gems and also to make L and O get their comeuppance as figure out why they become heartless bullies.
ARr
{□□♡○□¤》《《₩¥○♡♡♧♡\•>♧<[[\
I love how before they all froze, Q gave the ? To N before they all froze
For a moment i thinked Z is zoomed so far but i realised he is a planet, maybe he can be so far from the group, also, he naybe his time reverse expand and reversed time for not to mention he maybe can be a planet, also, where is Z stepping?
New ending
N huge p because l and o left him that p pick him up than n was happy
Not true
Ngrown up O  and L targets N
Did Q send N to the past? Did Z send N to the past? I wonder about it
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This video is ugly
Hey request (you don’t have to do this if your don’t want to) can you make one last episode of them back at the future? I want to see what changed since N time traveled and changed the past, did N and F become evil since in the other past n took m,l,and o’s side and f ran away to become evil? Or did something lose happen like it caused everyone that died to come back to like and l,m, and o said sorry to n, and f and they became friends again.
This one is smelly and shit frick ugly
The ending we need
Please make a Alphabet lore 2 in other time line
Whyyyyy is Z the world
Nah dis sith tu cringe 😢
Now they commit genocide together
I’m glad you made more alphabet lore videos I love this vid
This is such a good sequel

True ending
My name starts with H Name: hugo
WOW COOL
WELP gues that was ZHE END haha            ik it wasn't really funny sry
May F Rest In Peace ✌️
have a rematch against the l and the o
This was better then the Bad ending
He did a ctrl z
f stand for friendship
i cant wait for a next time wont you sing with me
Without Q or Z they wouldn't have known that F was nice but Q showed F was nice, Q also knew Z was the planet so Z and Q worked together. So Z used his power to get back in time so that N can help F so F won't kidnap the other letters, but N can only remember what happened in the future.     And that is my theory
this make me happy cry
A true work of art, masterpiece, perfection! No Hollywood movie beats that! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I think you're right z and Q we're trying to save the alphabet world I think
0:02 you can see they regret about what they did
Well at least I didn't get betrayed by n
&
z in lowercase is cute 🙂
:3
:3
That kyooooooooo tho
Is that why people ship f and n
Bro z is like 🫠
Make alphabet lore is not the end
This is not an alternate universe. This is in the main universe.
F in the chat for F
Omg Lowercase z
what q
Ñ is alphabet Lore group from LMNOP
Do a new alplandet Loré without the Loré, and everyone is nice, even f, L and O to  ,
My favorite letters are V,W,N,F,A,P
Q is knida crazy for N
Number lore when
Can you explain why the alphabet lives on top of Z
Bring this back!
Finally, the true ending, and n stood up for f and got hurt with him what a great friendship, hope you all have s great day if you read this 1:10 f 1:50 💋
That was sad
I can’t believe that N standed up for F when they were little and when they grew up the other letters thought he was A bad guy and when F grew up he took the powers from LMNOP
😭😭😭
I have no idea why g is clumsy
Wait, did I see BTW?
The thumbnail literally said, “Gay”
letter P is such a sweetheart omg i love her
why did Q's eye glow on the thumbnail?
Poor F no cap
Q Z and N are the most important
What about next time won’t you sing with me

Who got snake🐍    👇
That's so sad
It would it number lord next
Imagine if there was another episode where the title is: “Next time won't you sing with me.” And it's like the original alphabet lore video except N and F are living together and instead of being villains, they are hero's together.
Very sad story and why FINALE?
Next Time Won't You Sing With Me should be what happened after the epilogue
0:24 💀
😁   z    que    ases

0:22 kyoooooooooooooooooooooo 0:34 e o f
Join the norme army cuz why not
I love how Q was just like:TAKE THIS
Wait If Z is the planet they are on than what other unknown letters is Z seeing in space?
W for n , not the alphabet lore one
Wait wait wait wait P is the MOM!!??
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺👏👏👏👏👏
Best Friends ever
Is someone have to stop a letter "L" & "O"
This is so sad
It would be soooo cool obviously for a number lore to come out. Maybe make it a completely different story than the alphabet lore, but the exists in the same world. (Maybe use the joke 7 ate 9). It would also be really cool to see a shapes lore. Maybe even color lore…  Also how do they spell words with repeated letters? Can they duplicate? What about words with Z in it? Do they jump off the world?
Please do number lore one
F is not a villain  The real villain is L and O
finally z is happy
It made me cry, but I didn't quite understand this ending.
In math, f and n next to each other means function. Maybe played a part into their roles?
I guess there’s not gonna be a part called Next time won’t you sing with me
Dije que la f era buena
lom
wow a good ending
999999/1000
baby letter z still have weird voice.
i love how P kiss N

That was so sad 😭
;)
Q:eat dis nut n!
Q eyes:imma leave this slug
Whats even more interesting is thats F captured R, I, E, D, and S which is ironic because if he captured N he could of formed the word FRIEND  so maybe F tried making them his friends but ever since the incident he could not make friends so he did this.
Is Q or Z god?
Pls
Make nember lore
Hey dude, why don’t you make some plushies?
F didn’t do anything wrong

Does anyone not realize we see baby z in this video When n and f were in the cave they were still babies therefore z was a baby too And i have more evidence,when f went into his cave in the first alphabet lore video f was a baby but then the video showed f growing up and at that moment z was grown up as well  So we now know what baby z looks like

F Known  N Is Her Best Friends
Z saves the day, turns out he’s much more than just a planet!!!
Q and Z =
Mike Part 2 you win F and N
The Good Behavior Ending: 1:50
The fact that Q gives him the question mark as soon as they see the sky turn blue means that he knows what is happening, maybe meaning that the time reset has happened before.
Final song is abc song a-n
Women's alphabet lore
Now I know my ABC’S

Good ending

Z  happy ??
baby z
How did every character gotten their role?
Now I now my abc😂
I have a theory that the next video will be like this(go under the message to see)     So if n made a good ending then ... Why did N k!ll F if he was his best friend well it's because N actually betrayed him and became evil so that's obviously a reason why N killed F to make the letters not get harmed
bro mi man this is good it was l and o fault not f
Claim your “TRUE ENDING” ticket here
okay let watch the video 🙂
Why isnt anyone talking about the ; and ? Forming &? THAT is a Genius move
I feel worry about f
This is sad what
Awh
IM SO DUM
1:35 the reason why there swapped is they like to see each other  So f likes to see n And n likes to see f But soon f won’t like n Once he is grown up
This is Russian alphabet im jokeing but i wouldn't be surprised
Yo theory time Even though it says final what is there is more cuz if u stupid after the “now I know my abcs” there is “next time wont you sing with me” so maybe there will be more or I hope :)
1:55 F❤️N
I hope he make number lore 1-100 that will be 10x the lore
This is a Happy ending that came up
1:58 happy Z
Ice cream can be pronounced I’s cream, which means letters can c- I mean have a nice day.

When the letters finished watching there past they all look at F's dead body regretting what they did to him, but Q and Z came to the rescue. Now N and F are living together as friends... Or is it something else?
Can i know the music at 0:01?
F gang 👇
Really Bad Ending: Now there's 2 evil people to stop

I am gonna cry this is so heart breaking and not in a sad way but in a good way.😭😮‍💨
They should pay what they did to f
Comment F for respect
Q and Z was the only one who can save the lore..
Good ending:)
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
That's the ghost of F
Check out of the beginning I see him 0.1 seconds
He was on the F Inside Of the F
Did I notice F on the very beginning
This videos are very funny😂
F dead? No! It F on the balcony!
I cried 😭
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt
f is realy dead?
I would like to see a sequel
Its L and O fault
F and N are best friend And n change his mind that F is good and nice F did nothing wrong F is the best Letter he's Nice I love Alphabet Lore I like P N and F
Is anyone going to mention that f's semicolon and n's question mark combined looks like an ampersand? I'm not sure but I think it means something about how the friendship between then is going to continue and happiness of the alphabets still remain.
정말 고맙습니다 n이겁재이라서 안도와줄주알았는데 결국엔 해피네요
PROOF P DIZERVED THERE GEM? OR WHATEVER IT IS

Crying in the house for a

f : YODA
There's a leak...
Now I know my ABCs
Man i’m crying
I watched the first vid thinking this would be dumb  Turns out it was stupidly wholesome
XD
F
Who knew the abc’s song had an story well made about it
Hey
I like Z
I mean
Z is a s
The way this ending works is basically telling you that Z is a God why because he can make time backwards basically it's all the entire world goes backwards meaning anything that doesn't like he can just reverse it
c o w a r d
Make the finale alphabet lore but (part 2)
Finally z gains a happy ending
I love the fact that everyone thinks this is the ”good ending” even tho it’s only the first chapter of the story
The end of the video made me cry 😭
I wonder if the creator will make a story for after this for what would happen if they grew up in the alternate timeline
good ending 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It was very cool, it looks like a movie XD hahahahaha
F N amigo
The thumbnail is just so...AMAZING IM ABOUT TO EXPOLDE IN TO PIECES
Fun fact: the duo "fn" can be called "frightening nightmares"
This is way more sad
Maybe you can make “Next time won’t you sing with me”   Edit: This aged well
Awwwww❤❤❤❤
Nerd! see you are in the Nico nextbots in Roblox!

1:03
;))) sad you
Hmmmm you should do numbers and make 7 evil cause 7 ate 9... And do not called it number lore it sounds weird but if you want
Exactly
2:03 z
R-U-N Not horror movie! I like the way it was like Z is the planet of the universe and the one thing that is the greatest is that Q is a time machine. The Things: 1: years  2: months 3: days That is it!
I feel bad for F bc he was betrayed. :(
Fun fact: Everything is happening on Z, he is the floor and in the whole history we've seen him but we didnt know about it
Z the creator
plz make another alphabet lore story but if that actually happens, Basically the epilogues epilogue
Was to sleep...

FF
/e pin
How did Q know what to do as soon as Z started to reverse time? Does the question stone give him that knowledge? Is this not the first time this has happened?😺
Finnaly I don't need to cry on alphabet lore :-)
Now thats a happy ending :)
Z is happy now

Why is f also black in lowercase
BABY
Y
We began to a cute and cool letter saying Ayyyy and funny things, but the serial becames to somethink better than anime.
the ending that nobody, ABSOLOUTLY NOBODY, asked for but we still got it
1:15 lmo???
Why is G uppercase at 1:00?
At first I thought this was not made by the great Mike salcedo,found out it was when looked at the channel,this guy better gets an award
lowercase f is so cute 😍
1:32 &
thank you for alive F.
1:56 good ending, pink and beige becoming best friends
Mrbeast: Subscribe or I will murder Karl: Yippee Me: Does that mean Mrbeast will kill Yippee from evade roblox?
Give this an academy award
That moment f and n made me happy cuz l and O pushed f and n looks like l and O kinda nice rn
Can you make number lore?

Plant Z: owns by Z and Q
Hey mike salcedo could you stop alphabet lore cuz there are so many channels that are making cringe videos
Well now I wanna see how much different life is for them now that they fixed everything
Que bueno f y n se juntaron que lindo
F DID NOTHING WRONG!!!! F DID NOTHING WRONG!!!!!! CMON GUYS REPLY F DID NOTHING WRONG!!!!  COMMENT IT THIS IS FOR F!!!! F DID NOTHING WRONG!!!!!  SUPPORT F   F DID NOTHING WRONG! 👇                     👇
Now I know my abcs more like now I know myself
:)
We need more or Yoshi gets it   👇
We need Z's power and N's braveness..............................................
Dammit Mike now I gotta go back and actually pay attention instead of laughing at how the children sound saying the ABCs lmao....
This is beautiful.
It's the lowercase z why in the world would you ask that it's a little Z it's not the large Z is like big as a skyscraper and it's the lowercase not like a little this is little it's like a tiny bit but it's like squeezed
I just like that n and and f best friends forever
The first one was the bad ending and next one is the good ending
This is amazing
P+N=❤
Basically, Z is God and Q is Jesus
F F F F F F
i love the good ending it's so good f and n they're in love
0:18 Why did no one suspect that it said "btw" 😂
sad but time
Back to 1999 when the ABCs are kids
Well done will there be another part where f and n are evil and the story is completely different or make number lore
0:10 I see F😮 Was the shot F a clone, or is it just an error🤨
Number Lore Pls
Now make “next time wont you sing with me….” To finish it of now that were in a different timeline when n didnt backstab f
Z’s voice still sound like a old man when he was small and even when he grew up
Why B  and  T and W is there
Mike salcedo con you make a number lore just like this please
happy ending bad ending
Zzz
I’m surprised U was in the ending. He only got like 10 seconds of screen time.
🥹👏🏻FNfn
Paaaarttttt 33333 nooooowwww
now thats what i call a ending 🤘
More alphabet pls!!!!!!!
0:18 BTW
0:13 Z jupiniter
I have more examples of good endings. F had friends for everyone except for L and O. All the letters defat L and O together. And G and P are going to be married.
Make a vid that z got hit by an asteroids
NUMBER LORE PLS?
Abi şöyle bir şey yapsanız olur mu mesela F herkesle barışıyor ve mağara yıkılınca z'de yıkılınca bütün harfler aşağı doğru kayıyor ve x'in tılsımını alıp herkesi kurtarıyor sonra bütün herkes f ile barışıyor l ile o f den özür diliyor çünkü kavgayı ilk l ile o başlattı
Can you add U to the party it will spell FUN
cool ending
What could F do now? Maybe revenge on L and O!
I like how f is happy and N always I like the song when F is behind N i like this Z is so cute when he is a baby and happy he so cute and when he grow up He became sad
z is so cute
If this was the actual ending alphabet lore would be completely different lol
YESSSSSSSS
:)
Z sent N to the past and Q give N question mark so he will not accidentally eat it. That how I understand this episode.
One day, this man woke up, and decided the world does not have enough good YouTube videos. So guess what he did…        He made this.
All they need is "I" and then it can finally be "FIN"
and now, the last of the trilogy, "Next time wont you sing with me."       I'm kidding but it may happen but not likely bc in here it says epilogue but you never know
Woah this was 10 days ago and this got a million views😮😮😮😮😮😮
guys, what is the name of the song when Z did the spinny reverse time thingy?

The most disturbing part about this, is that even though N had a happy ending, he will still remember all the things that happened after all the horrors that happened.  Edit: my god some people are taking the lore a little *too* deep.
Do more alphabet lore episodes
Fun Fact: F is the 6th Letter of the alphabet and L is the 12th letter of tbe alphabet , so L hates F because hes the same digit divided into 2

Sooo cuteee
☑ crying because my comment has 0 likes ☑ using comment art by @facemojikeyboard  Happy when n helps f then now they are finally friends.. Until when z is happy..
😎👍
For the moment of when Z makes the whole entire alphabet lore universe turn into baby letters again, how he did that is he actually is a giant letter so he is basically the universe. And all the other letters are tiny they're just small. Now that I said that, do you see it now?
N and P look so                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             CUTE! When there lower case

Awwwwww that so cute i well downloud it if i get hurt 💓💓💓
What’s the story behind the two dots Z gets?
That is a good ending! 🥺
Legal mas por que não saiu a parte 3
eu não acredito nisso 😱
This is an emotional roller coaster
I don’t know if L and O got punished or not
Weird how they finally spelt "G A Y"
Can you please give us a vid of the epilogue and the regular alphabet lore combined?
F did nothing wrong
I'm happy for F and N
Noo this cant be happening the finale!!😭

Zz
Z is God of Time
I like how Z let Q try to warn them before reversing time since I imagine how risky it would be to reverse time, but Q wasn’t fast enough so Z did the riskiest move ever and saved F and the other letters
WHAT about double letters
2 best moments Q and Z worked together to make the past better F and N were best friends that keyboard made one key for them...
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
0:24 never pause alphabet lore
fn
I love this 1:22
i just love how k just goes with it like K
Good ending
I beg you too add a human version of this it would be interesting!
Mugan Meeeeiiiiyyyyyy…………
And in the end, F never became evil and he and N became best friends and lived happily ever after. The End
I just had a horrible thought.  So, this ending seems happy, but then, N is the only factor stopping F from snapping again, isn't he? Both of them lost their other friends. N still has to live with the trauma F caused- who's to say they'd get along forever? Who's to say N can handle that pressure?  Who's to say that F wouldn't spiral again eventually, and do everything again?
Wait Plz continue making Alphabet's that is changed  what will happend in the future then? with F not dead?
I never knew a animation about alphabet could be on the whole YouTube platform
Z used all his power so n can go back in time to the old time to change everything
@SVEN
What about upper case letters?
The first they were  sad cuz f tries to spell friends again but n killed him
Good ending crack
Thanks for the happy ending, I thought I would cry forever over the ending.
It must not become nostalgia!
Z activated his powers and then Q tried to take the ? back but he gave it to N so N saw the future and decided to help FFFFFFFFF
fn
Z
Happy Halloween To Alphabet Lore!

Fact about mike: he joined YouTube 11 years ago

f😊n
Z is calm because there is no fighting and bullying because of the past f became kind and friendly but because o and l f became angry with o and l if n wasn't scolded nah so f was actually kind and friendly to a - z but he didn't like o and l .
2:04 BABY Z COMFIRMED!?!!1!!!???

Alphabet Lore (A-Z...) (1/2) * Now I Know My ABCs (...Epilogue) | Alphabet Lore(2/2)
Why did tested and came back to life when he’s a adult
Poipirr
Bro i just cry is so sad
yes😊
I want more
Yay alphabet lore
"Q" gives the "N" the "?" orb so "N" could remember the past when he was young meanwhile "Z" is traveling the time. "N"s future memories goes along with the time travel.
this is a great ending we all needed thank you Mike Salcedo.
the ending was so good that I watch it millions of times hope you make something as popular as this again
Now we know ABC’s next time won’t you sing with meeeeeeeeee  this was super sad that was crazy crazy I can’t believe that actually happened I’m so happy that they all got along (:

0:42 is the cutest thing  heard in my life😂
Firendy fn
Dd Ff Nn
Q and Z are heros because they care about love and aways have a chance.
It shows that never be a coward and stand up for your bf.
Why are l and o are in the same place.
Number lore  is coming because there was a old video called 7 Eats 9.
Plz
I want to know more can you make alphabet the third
Aww it’s baby z
Creator of app lore should make a version of this lol
if you havent noticed, before the flashback Z was capital but then after the flashback z is lowercase.

Q
Day 3 of asking for a number lore
I thought this was a fan made
guys just read the description I'm very happy that thinks milke salcedo to do more with the series :D
Can you also make a love story with A + F can you please
This is the best thing I have ever watched the best of the best for sure
Good 😌
Little did u know, f and n would be the greatest duo for being a hit man's and murdering random letters.
still looks kinda unfinished
bro i was thinking this is a fan madeee
You will make a number lore?
z baby
N:hug P:kiss kiss 💋
https://youtu.be/3xumMJpM1gU
POV: going back in time
Origin the end
This isn't an ending, this is a sequel to the prolouge, which explains why they've seen what happened and why Z is already sad in the first place. There is no good ending. If there was, N would've cared about F in the first place instead of betraying him; meaning F wouldn't go in a rampage in the first place.
This makes sense. Since the ellipsis (the …) means that there’s more, Z must’ve made the story go on, and bend reality. Z is an eldritch god, change my mind.
The happy ending
Best true ending
This was sad and ended happy. This is a masterpiece and nobody can convince me that it's bad. Great story.
z
I have am idea for the ending You May give lowercase z tears To make balls
0:41 n pls save f
😢 F 🙁 ❤ FN❤ Z

Alphabet lore is sad, dark and funny + stupid at the same time
Amor tá me dando vontade de chorar velho você me dá muita vontade de chorar😭😭

When the question mark and the semicolon touch, it looks like an ampersand. &. The punctuation mark used to inseparably link two subjects together.

This is the true ending AKA the happy ending
After every letter got beat up Z Finally did something to save the letters and himself
N just got coconut malled
This ending is the best!!
I love happy endings ^^
When I thought the alphabet lore was finished, it wasn’t. The hero Z and Q. Are the great of this roam. And n helping f looks so emotional. Another masterpiece again, Mike Salcedo.
Now it’s time for *number lore*

Q tells everything fr
QvQ
😭😭🤧☺️
yes I finale found the original 🥰🥰🥰
Me after watching this *stares at the Fn button on my keyboard itensively*
I really like how this story is about standing up for yourself and don't let be mean because stuff can happen that you did not want to do in your life and q knew this was going to happen let me tell you the story so when q came he knew this was going to happen because of the start so I think z and q teamed up together to stop so that is why q got the ? and it was to go back in time I think it was mainly z that did the stuff the end☺.
I thought this is fan made

Oh my oh my
YAY❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I LOVE THIS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Make a “next time wont you sing with me…” to see what happened/happens after “now I know my ABC’s…”
This is what should have happened
f+u+n fun
Aww that's a good story I feel bad
Good ending 😭😭😭😭😭😭
L and o are the bully they wont stop bullying or they will attack f or something
Aww f and n are best friends is a good ending!
Here are some ideas: alternate ending(they revive F with the ? Gem since it is his due to color), Next time won’t you play with me (the origin of Z), outer space (Z meets the other planets[possible collab with numbers lore and shapes lore]) and cursive (the letters are all in cursive). I would really like to see at least one of these ideas (basically bc the animation still feels unfinished) I hope you add one of these ideas. Anyways have a nice day
now we need “next time won’t you sing with me”
Happy ending
Sad😭
Z: nah not going to happen i want a happier endding
:)
Ik like the alphabet lore feels like its unfinished, this dude found our last ending
Now all we need is "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me"
Oh no I am crying right now
F did nothing wrong
F did nothing wrong
F did nothing wrong
F did nothing wrong
YASSS ANOTHER PART

This was very well done, but I wonder why l and o did bully in the first place
What will *Next time won't you sing with me* be like?
Q
Wait For F And N🥰🥰🥰
Good Ending :D
*sobbing* next t-time won't you sing w-w-with me....
I NEED A PART 3
I love this
It is ovious that Q and Zsend back time i like it when n hugs p p kisses n
Hold Up Wait A Minute why do I still think they're dating
Z 0:10 Z 2:03
Z was sad because of all the madness what was going on
When F got hurt F cant hold it so that why N defend F
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! ITs So GOoD
Oh my god it is so GOoD
oh my god it is so sad!!! 😭😭😭😭
We did it fellas we got the good ending.
The art?
YEEESSSSSSSS
Bruh make a sequel pls
Este Video Me Hace Llorar😭😭😭😭😭😭
Did anyone notice that l,m,and O never got their powers in this one and the power gems where actually punctuation marks and math smybols
Awsome
what happens in this part if you don’t understand: basically remember how in the first ending well like not the true ending q swallowed the ? Gem and saw the future and what would happen that’s why he was trying to catch up to them and after he showed them they were sad that they killed F because N well brutally killed him with a laser so then Z uses his tears to reverse time yes they are tears because in the not true ending there were two around him and then he cried a tear which became another one so they’re basically tears that can reverse time so then after that Q gives N the magic gem and they got back to the past and then instead of betraying F N actually stands up for him and then they get bullied together and this time F gets the orange gem and N gets the ? gem and then he hugs p and cries out her gem and then they go live in the castle and then Z is a lower case and he’s happy this time
:)
Yo Mike Please do the Soundtracks from alphabet lore (without voices, And I know people made some soundtracks, But just not all of those soundtracks, So pls make them)
Though this is a better ending, I still don’t like it though. Sure, f and n seem to be happy together, but after being hated, beaten up and separated by the other letters, who knows if they’ll eventually become an evil duo?
I think we can all agree this was the best ending
ThE wHeEls On ThE BuS Go RoUnD AnD RoUnD
Wait.. if letters become capital when they grow up, then what about Z? Does the world get bigger as time goes on? THESE ARE THE REAL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS Can they create words with two of the same letter? How many sets of letters are there?!?!?
This was truly amazing.  However... I do see more Alphabet Lore content coming from you in the future, some of which could be non canon. Like, what if we saw more of G speaking morse code? F getting a power? X and Y (or G and P) getting married? More punctuation gems? What else IS there?  I mean, this is "zee ..... end" of the main story of Alphabet Lore, but that doesn't mean the *whole world* of Alphabet Lore is over yet.  After all, "Y" shouldn't "U"? C'mon Mike, it's gonna be fun!
Nana ur only geol
Next number lore?
0:50 does anybody else think of a rocket taking off because every time I heard this music I just think of NASA
Good job n
Q and Z are the chosen ones
Baby Z is so adorable i want him as a plushie!!!
Z really went “nah, it’s rewind time.”
Now I know why F did nothing wrong
0:18 BTW
😲😢😁😁😁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
If you noticed this N’s mom - p N’s dad -f
I like n just thinks about his friend f
Why is it growing so fast
now Z's tear gem now has a whole new meaning Z's tear gem has the ability to reverse time or control endings, and can only be accesed if Z went nuts like at nZ.... episode
When q sa qooo its like hes singing
0:10 pause there and you’ll actually see F still standing on top of the cave.
Q be like: you got the power now SCRAM
Can you make the abc lore when they was growing  up
So did z reborn himself
Make another alphabet lore story, Please....😀❤️❤️ I like it😀😀
This is sad and hapy
Remember what happened to J what happened to him
i know
Make a number lore
Yaaaaaaaaay Epilogue
Bro z just go back in time
We need another one!
The Z is the whole planet and reversed time while Q just gave N the ? Gem so that N could go to F and stay with him witch made a happy ending. But i notice Z when he reversed time he turned into a bubble. And they returned friendship. Z looks diffirent when he was little and he looked very happy but normal Z he looked cracked and sad and had tears spinning around him.
I like the final
This one is holsom
It kinda breaks my heart a little seeing n beat up but also seeing him so happy with f is more than enough to repair that.
I love this it makes me wanna cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I Have an question Is p is the mom of n and g?
Can we get another alphabet lore but after this happened please?
Sì stannes Z
Then both F and N become terrorist
the same size of Z
you should do number lore next like say have zero next to Z please
now we know what the ? thing is and the things around z is just like past orbs things
Good content but just the Q and W
Hi
P
and then N and F destroy everything
Normal ending to good ending
Number lore 🙏
The ending is so cute I can't hold the cuteness 😭
The ending is so cute I can't hold the cuteness 😭
&:friendship, never ends
YESSSSS A HAPPY ENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought z was 100 years old
Same
Ohhhhhhhh, I finally get it. So basically before everything happened, f got bullied when they spelled frick, and then n decided to join l and o, making the future happen. Now I realize that since q knew everything and z probably also knew everything or didn’t, just survived after F got killed, Z rewinded everything, probably knowing that N would take the question gem or whatever and fix the future. I realized nowq😑
Me thinking there's gonna be a number lore after this. And then a shape lore. And symbol lore.
Number lore?
z Is So Cute. Z Is A Bit Longer Than z. And Also z Is A Bit More Thick. And Z Has A Bit Longer "/"
I guess this all has a happy ending! :)
😂😂😂😂😂😂

Make a New alphabet lore animation
Make an part 4 please and I promise to subscribe everyday
Q was like "oh we redoing this? fr?"
just watched everything of alphabet lore started from A going to Z then watching this, its beautiful.
o and l at 1:05:n what are you doing
3 PARTE DE EL ALPHABET
z looks so happy but why the original voice (as a kid)
so z basically can change the past
Where's the music?
Sad ending: happens Z: BITCH!
Z: I don't want the friendships break... but I Know what to do...!
1:41 and g still falls.
3. Will it come ?
(Joke) F is just happy he is getting beat up with n on his side
I think I saw something like f & n
Numbers lore
Alfabeto 2
hey mike salcedo can you do official number lore?
This is better than any marvel movie they could make
0:41 n's voice is so cute
and Z  and Q teenage N eat ?  and Q
F died N kill rainbow A-Z part 2
L & O: Push F to make him say frick F: Gets bullied and turns evil L & O: Why is F so evil?     (Also imo I do not think L and O are the true villains. Getting bullied is a sad story, but don't take your anger out on killing 40% of the population and psychologically hurting the rest. I especially am mad at r, i, c, and k as they probably saw f getting pushed.)
Number lore is coming
I cried it’s so sad
No es que  k is dead
This is making me cry cuz it’s soooo cute!
Fn
Z . ?
Everyone realize they were being mean to f first
It's sad how Z couldn't go back enough to save H
This lore is so sad
I understand now why f and n were the bestest of friends and not any of the other friends it’s because on the keyboard the key “fn” makes it look like Mike salcedo did something besides letters and punctuation as a secret (if you didn’t know)
What the hell p 1:50
How did did she had those cracks when when in the same when he with the crystals come out of his when he cries it out how does he get those broken parts of them I wonder how
If A was there with lom it would say lmao
This is the good ending
He knows his abc’s
Someone noticed that when Z was happy   He was looking like a baby?

I like how q and z were working together but q could not catch up to them but the he finally did to show them to truth. But also, what happens when they are adults when n fixed everything. what does z look like when they are uppercase and they are all friends?
Awww that was a happy ending it was good to I kinda like it but Z umm  his voice it sounds like a but you don't have to worry about that is not that important anyways
🥲🥲🥲🥲
😭😭😭f❤️n
*Z like: ZZZ : means no today buddy :lowercase Z there we go every thing back today until then….. now I know my ABCs Next time won’t you sing with me 🥲

I can’t believe that you that you did a happy ending
Man, l and o are arseholes.

I Will Serish what happened when this was uploaded, we went to eat at Applebees, then we went to Bradley farms i shot zombies and did stuff inside, then i sat by the campfire, a dog came and gave me lovings, then after a while we went to get milk and some snacks, but where we stopped has no milk, so we got mtn dew hawiaan punch and nesquilk chocolate milk bottle, then we went home and i instantly layed down and my feet felt so good, that was the best day ever, i love you all and be kind and play at fun places...
The blue balls around z is changing everything from start to end

Why are both n and f friends
That a good ending
This is so cute I'm gonna cry omg ❤
Ugh i really hate f cave idk lol
Can you pls make an ending where all the letters beat up L and O
Both endings made a deep impact even thoe it was just the alphabet it was made into something even better with every letter the story progressed untill the final letter even the simple fact that the childhood memories were the lower case letters was so in detail from start to end it was amazeing.
This is very cool!!!!!!!!!!!!😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
0:18 By The Way
tHE HAPPY ENDING I WANTED ❤
Good job for f and n
And The Part 2 Begins I Am So Ready For This Video Remember Q And Z Were Working Together To Fix Everything For Anything Like F And N Who Became Best Friends
this is when N prefers F to L and O. this is a good ending I. I am very touched if N and F are still true friends😢😢😢😭😭
😊
if they addad two l means it have lol
So f n sweet.
A happy ending
Yeah
fun fact: when we show sleep letters in chat, we make Z's name longer (Zzz)
0:17 I just realised that B, T and W spelt BTW. They also spell it in the short "Y". Edit: At the end little z says "zee-zen" which sounds like "please send". So does he wants us to send fan art?
I2iwkkwj y j ejh1:23
it made me cry 🥺🥺😭😭😭
True
F
The animation is wonderful
😩 🙏          😇🤧
OH YEAH! FINALLY WHE KNOW WHAT DOES  BABY Z LOOKS LIKE!!!
The perfect ending to an amazing series
In the front there is G A  and Y wich spells GAY.
WE WANT PART 3
😅
the fact that this was actually made my Mike Salcedo, it makes it 9000000000x times funnier.
Period: Freeze a letter. Comma: Slow a letter. Semicolon and Colon: Conjoin a letter. Exclamation Mark: Speeds up a letter. Asterisk: Multiply a letter. Question Mark: Precognitive Abilities Ellipsis (...) Can rewind time. Also when used with Question Mark it can bring future information to the past. As shown here.
Come on n Do it it now
This is so cool 😎  I new that there was going to be a pt 2 to this.
A lowercase Z!
it is verd happy ending iv'e ever seen it
Yayyy, happy ending!
plis contine
Is this like the part 2 of alphabet lore? Or is the good ending?????
Would there be another one with f and n
During the beginning, the lore began to end, with the entire lore becoming uncapitalized. They turned back on f in the normal, but this is just so great to see Z reset the lore with everything happy. Good job on the animation!
Feels like all stories have a happy ending :)
ANXP
!!!!!
00:09 this friend
Come to think of it,  Z might have the most tragic backstory. Also one thing i don't get: Popcorn. That has 2 Ps in it, so how are you gonna get 2 Ps? Same for the lowercase too.
F is innocent
Yo this Secret ending is sad and cool
Love☺☺
At a time when everyone was trying to kill each other, Z saved everyone without casualties ..
F
Гофры руки дщьв за б гг дтзц

Sus
I-...odd question how many times do you think z reseted the alphabet timeline?
Wow! Z did something to make f happy!
Let’s go Z
I'm gonna cry 😢
q gave n the ? wich allows one to see both future and past so n knew everything and q did not know anything wich means f did not become a bully and in fact has a freind and q gets to live their life AND z gets to watch a happier show (: i think im right but im not sure
W animation, lowercase Z is so sigma-looking btw!
I think Q should have merged with U and become like super powerful or something like that
Yay now that that's over H, J, C, and P are alive (except H)
Aww
Wow  and adorable 10/10
um... p what
When I 1st saw this I thought it was made by someone else
if you stop when the screen scrolls out the cave you can see F on his mouth HOW IS HE ALIVE?????
Mike salcedo can you do the alphabet lore humans
WOW I love a how N and F are friends:)  AND LOWERCASE Z!?
What. & f&n
Z is a planet
Baby z is the cutest
We want Letter I alive!

It's really sad really in me and the other one that he made it's really sad in the end but the good thing is that and the other end and despicable the good thing that that has a good ending
Lego movie Lego movie it really looks like that the team here really did that for it for nothing in the future to happen so everybody in the alphabet load will be happy
Lake Texas working together to go back in time I think because in the future and now they're going to that nothing bad is going to happen to the rest of the floor so that's why I think
Won’t you come and sing with me

Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Little does everyone realize N and F are gonna be the greatest villainous duo that ever lived
1:42 we finally headed p,s sound when she is young but look at g brush

Kangry cuento todo es la armonía qué tío que es que fuera el gemelo
Un momento que hace que esta f en mí
Can you do a sequel of alphabet lore
N hugs P but since everyone didn't know F was evil
1:52 Who else noticed the rhythm was "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" ?
This could have been the good ending we all wanted
NUMBER LORE NOW PLSS
OMG BABY Z SO CUTE
Omg z is so cute when he is happy
make more pls
Z is making a ring that can turning back time
A good ending
Finally
why does z as a child sound like a 70 year old man
Some say that is the happy ending
I think Z his got a powered to reverse         on the time. 00:47 Come'on n dont be a coward.
F did nothing the crystals belong to F
Yays for friendship!
Güzel bir finel olbu
The good ending.
Alphabet lore the final
it was short but man this is the ending we needed <3
I Will cry😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Make it the present day and N and F are still friends and the beat up L AND O
Finally z
The happy ending :>
Good ending
and then F and N would go on to go to a massacre to spell out "more"
I heart❤ the ending chefs kiss ❤
So cute
Now thats just sad
F R I E.   D S U G M A N Y Q
Who else thinks n had the black eye already? 👇
I just realised the expression of Z is how everyone acts… I guess F wasn’t connected to it the first time
When the semicolon and question mark gems appeared, they combined to make an ampersand (&)!
1:10 £
Q and Z are the real heroes here
Awww ‘? They can go together
lowercase z??????????????
so sad beacas of N and F and made it sad to
Happy ending momen
How did n eye get purple when he got hit in the back
This is like a remake of the alphabet lore
I think n knew the future because he had the question mark right before and while z was doing his thing with his orbs, so when time was turned back he knew to stand up for f so nobody would die
when I looked it got 3M views in 1 day. Like my god people like these
The first time I saw this on a YouTube short I thought someone else made it
“Hurt people, Hurt people”
…
Me estoy ofendiendo porque mi nombre enpiesa con F
Normal bad ending but🍑 now i know my abcs alphabet lore good ending
Wait wait what happend after when they were is the castle ?????? Did they go to freddy Fazbear’s pizza to get pizzas?
It's the abc song
So here's my idea for a sequel: we're back to when the letters are adults and it opens with F and N playing a card game at the cave cuz they're bffs now, (with C, A, R, D and S being the actual card deck because funny) when suddenly, G visits the cave. He tells F, N and the gang to follow him, and he leads them to a building that wasn't seen in the OG vid. They go inside and find P (because P and G had an off-screen wedding) working on a cloning device. N asks what it is. G goes inside the machine, and BAM out come two Gs. Everyone is amazed. P reveals that they made the machine so they could make more words, such as CHICKEN, CHEESE and BURGER. Meanwhile, back at the cave, L and O sneak in because they want revenge. F and N hear crashing and run back to the cave to find L and O trashing it. F merges his ; gem with N's ? gem to form he & gem, which doubles their power, but will it be enough to save the cave and possibly all of Z? If you make this a reality, we can find out.
Need an part 2 for the peace of the letters , i think need this.
so will there be a part 2?
Now that we know what happens can we get like video game animation like Minecraft, Fortnite, or maybe more
so whaaat
This makes me so happy :D
I dare you to make an alphabet lore 3
Nice🥰🥰🥰
Lo evil now
Not gonna lie… this guy should literally work for netflix
I shed a tear
Now will there be another one because there is also next time won’t you sing with me maybe he just forgot that part idk I hope we see how the timeline changes cause p,h,c, and x would all be alive cause f never killed them and b would never be injured (I think maybe l and o died I have to rewatch it)
ADEFG
WTF
If N was smart:
Number lore and symbol lore when?
No finale do Alphabet loir 3 PLZ😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

We need alphabet lore the & letter
althabet lore still fells unfinished its like we dont know if N and F are good or bad it just ended like the other one with Z and in this one with lowercase z it like IDK. non the less the epilogue is still cool
I like the ending n and f are friends and baby z
Anyone noticed GAY in the beginning
Do u know wheen z was using his power as you seen 3 letters half dead it said btw with b t w
When I first saw that ending I almost cried legit
:')
So very nice, awsome work!
2:12 the true end
Also some people think that if there is an alphabet lore they need to make a number lore :/
L and O Started it not F
And there is & sign
captain tate was asking: IS F not evil anymore now that he has a friend?
Niiiiiiiiiiiice
whyyyyy do l and o have to be the 1st 2 letters of my name???/
This is the secret ending of alphabet lore
Time for Number Lore.
ABCSFK New alfabe
f finaly got his happy ending 😭
Could you make a third episode
So Q and Z work together, so then Z came out with the force field that reverse is time QK with the? At at the right time when it was about to hit the ground the force view of the letter Z Q gave him the? So then I can go back in time, but Z let him see back in time so he can save his friend bro they had a second chance because they already went back in time will just queue. No we can do it again because they brought back Z to life.
People now shopping f with n

I love that video
F&n:*hug* Me: bro are you gay
In normal ending
A sad about F I he just wants friends😢😢
This is the saddest and cutest video
QOOY
👍😭
wow cool video
If anyone has noticed, I love how F’s Question Mark (?) and N’s semicolon (;) both form to make an Ampersand. (&) Symbolizing that both N *AND* F now have each other. :) (Get it?)
This is a real happy ending
People think that it’s a different ending but noo. When Z was sad and had no powers that was BEFORE he got his revenge. They’re both the same ending.
I thought it was the end
You should do next time will you sing with me (the good ending when there grown-up)
Me be like:???

This was so sad I was like gonna cry but I didn’t and n wasn’t a coward
So sad😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
And sometimes i found loweecase z
Who else noticed that baby z sounds like a grown up
Fun fact: It was L and O's fault for bullying F now F strikes back
Q and Z have to be the most nicest characters-
The ending we all wanted But didn't expect
So we know Z's power ... Thingy now
I love the lowercase Z i would like it more if it had like braces or glasses but I like it!
After all the alphabet,D said his name but F came to D and Punched him then throwed D into E.While at the Cave D and E were kidnapped, G said his name twice but all of a sudden, F stepped on G, G got mad and called the ABC group then they spelled 'Cab' but F was smart,He hid inside of H but then H died twice now!The 2nd time was getting swallowed by F and got farted out of F. I does not know what F was doing but F squished I so he can use I as a weapon.I shot the cannonball to J, G was looking for F but he saw, K noticed his friend, J,dead but F got K as wings so F can fly
YESSSS LOWERCASE Z
I like the good ending
I love F
Why did n say p we he huged p

GOOD ENDING-
pleas part 3😁
I WILL CRY 😭😭😭😭 THAT WAS REALLY SAD I THINK
0:37
When you make the alphabet series ill cry caz its so sad but this finale series makes me happy✅😔🥲😀
I feel like they could somehow incorporate the forgotten letter of the alphabet thorn (Þ, þ) it was removed from her alphabet years ago and replaced with "th". It would technically be after Z in the alphabet.
😀 can I please have part 3
Z was not happy with the future so he went back in time... smart
The number lore is scary because 0 broke up with 2 because some one was in there way (0,1,2) Six is 5 not be fore but after Aⁿᵈ 3+ 3sum (3,4,5,6) 7 ate 9 (7,8,9) 10 was in 9-11 (9,10,11)
Can u add season 2 plz plz plz plz plzzzzzzzzzz
toddler need to watch this
Can you do 1-10

😔🥺😭😢
Wait so N and F and Q And Z is the main characters???
oh frick yeah
Make the different version of the alphabet time line
When is number lore done
That's so 😍 cute
Here's what I think will happen (Mike, you don't need to make another sequel, I don't want to see F die again)  Since now N and F got eachother's back, F has no reason to turn evil and, when they grow up again to uppercase, they will try to reconcile all the letters together, just like F was trying to do before but in more peaceful ways. Maybe F will be remembered as "the one who formed a swear word" but since now N has the question mark, he will remind them that it was accidental (because it was L and O that pushed F) and everyone will frown at L and O because they were bullies. At this point, there are three options:  1- L and O apologize for what they have done in the past and everyone live happily ever after (the ending everyone would want)  2- L and O will feel attacked so they'll separate from everyone and turn evil (then other battles take place which would probably lead at least 1 letter to death)  3- Everyone starts attacking L and O, which will lead to option 2 (this is the most likely to happen, imo)  However, no matter what happens, N  now can predict the future instead of Q. and, since Z certainly wouldn't want to intervene twice and rewind time once again (also letters wouldn't want to live their lowercasehood thrice) he now can pretty much stop things from happening because he has learned not to be a coward, which made him have F's back.   But what if Z had to intervene another time? I mean, still, N would warn everyone but what if his warnings failed like Q's did? Depending on which between options 2 and 3 took place, Z would probably act like a god and either scold L and O for causing all potential rivalries (and then remind them they were the reason F turned evil in the past) or the others for the "cycle of revenge" thing.   I can already see someone saying "maybe F and N will turn evil and history will kind of repeat itself". I don't think that would happen for two reasons:  1- It's true, N is no longer a coward but he still has a heart and definitely needs support, if he turned evil he wouldn't stand a chance against the letters who have the punctuation powers. Remember, F and N still cried the full stop, comma, colon and exclamation mark, which can still be used by L, M, O and P. Arguably, having the question mark does make N one of the most powerful letters but only emotionally, besides predicting the future what else can you really do?  2- if F started leaning back towards evil, N would stop him right away, either by using the question mark or by reminding F he was the one who gave him moral support after L and O hit him.  I hope someone sees this, since holy shit 25000 comments already, this better not get lost
유튜브의 신이시다ㄷㄷ
Z is the best of the best, the Literal planet saved everyone.
Fianlly a good ending 💔

Do the numbers lore
I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING. Z IS IN FACT A PLANET AND A LETTER
N is pretty small compared to F
Did Z and n change the past and future so this means with N and Z power they stopped f from dying and attaking and killing everyone and change him from evil to good' is that true

All F needed was some happiness in his life.
f and n are friends
0:18 spells btw
Sniff….sniff…that was beautiful. Z really is a Bro
Z Lowercase?
Does history repeat itself every time it ends?
(:
Ampersand &
0:10 F NEVER DIED
This is sad😭😭😭😭😭😭
Z was like : there WILL be a good ending * proceeds to fix everything  * ….. edit: at the end when you see z you can hear twinkle twinkle little star
LETS GO N
We need part 3 where it shows how they are in the future like adults
Sequel?
Oi
GUYS WE MIGHT GET NUMBER LORE! https://youtu.be/PjCxH42e5ss
Mike Salcedo make number lore or make alphabet lore 3 keep up the good content please
1:23 is it just me or am I getting some gay vibes. Also thank you for showing us what baby z looks like
What was the spinning of the tears doing? Pls reply to me... anybody.
00:9 on 0.25x speed another F on mountain which I have a prediction that the F who died was a copy of the other F scene on the mountin!!!.
Wait, Q, T and R are the only letters without square-ish eyes and QTR is Qatar with all the vowels removed...          So does that mean Mike Salcedo lives in Qatar!??!?!???.,;:!?*
Its good to see that N was actually standing up for himself instead of being scared of L and O
Next time it's gonna be number lore
Happy ending,I love happy ending
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Now lets have a season 2 PLEASE    and F and N sorta turn into F before Z did his power, but this time it’s better, and they can get revived from a new power: the “-“  Dash (-) because normally at the end of phrases it means that theres more-
"And then they both murdered letters while walking into the f's cave"
Q gave the Question Mark to n so Z could reverse time to when they were young so it was the opposite when they were Adults
Mike Salcedo Plz Do The Part 3 Where L & O Takes Revenge On F & N
That little tune at the end made me smile
Respeto a todos
So Cute When Z Tiny And All Alphabet So Cute😍❤💗🐘
una obra de arte
Actually Z has died when he used his gems to save everyone
I thought that Z was an adult when they were kids
Z reset power

We already have an sneak peak of number lore cuz back in 9 years ago Mike salcedo made a video about 7 eating 9 so sevens gonna be the bad guy in number lore
HELP, I DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SNAIL WAS Q-
Remember when none of them got 1M views
It's so cute when n is helping f😍
Good ending
OM
FGUANMYQ
F didn’t did anything wrong
Yes it ends on a high note finally a happy ever after
Has any one realised they spell Gay gun fun funy and man in one scene
🥺😭
Hey uh im wondering will you ever do number lore or are other will other people have to do that
I just wanna say that the ending reminds me of that one fn key on the keyboard we almost never use
Oh
Oh come on there must be more
OMG THEY REVEALED A KIDS VERSION OF Z
Isso foi muito muito muito triste 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I love it when f and n become friends
The lowercas l and m and o made lmo
Hy mike Salcedo I wanted to say if you could make a number lore it would be amazing if you could all the other number lores are either to of the road or they copy each other so pls we need number lore as a thing
The ending we all needed
Que bonito Final
So Q can use his eyes a a thingy to make things float
Bro but at least tho N stood up for F so F wouldn't go kill everyone like H and P and C and others too so it is so incredible 😌😌😌 and also the good animations all the coolest part but I didn't expect N to still remember what happened
n doesn't remember what happenned because he lived It, he does because Q gives him the ?. That explains why everyone is stilla mad at f
Nn
😊😊     😀
1:30 bruh I've just now noticed that the semicolon from f and the questionmark from n make a "&"
So "F" was never bad
N the goat
i knew my boy Q was gonna save the day sometime. by giving back all of the memories to N.
Is this a diffrent universe or is this cannon
This is much better yeah
Esque era negro xdxdxd
personaly i would like to see multiple different endings in the future because this is amazing like i love it  (ex: n didnt go with f but f went with n to the rest of the alphabet
What Z the in the power
What the in the power
Sad end of the films:🥱 Sad end of the Alphabet Lore: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥲
Number lore right here:  https://youtu.be/PjCxH42e5ss
l = Lowercase L
So it looks like Q and Z work together but how did they get to know how to do it and why I mean they did fix it but f is still bad so they really did nothing to help them and what happened in to Z because he’s cracked up in the real one but not here and one more thing what are the things around the Z planet I mean are they different planets is f good in them or is one of the others this still dose not tell the hole story or what happens before all of this
The whole saviour was not N but it was n ok? n stood up for f, gave p the stone, AND avoided g, l, and o OK?!?
This is such a story but why did all the other people turn it into trash youtube kids stuff?
Before the restart basically l and o are jerks
F U N fun...
a very good video🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
I am here now watching the good ending
You need to make plush toys, you would get a lot of sales and they would be sooooooo cool! + HAPPY EARLY HALLOWEEN😊😊🎃🎃
Very cool:)
I like how every time when Z dies instead of the alphabet lore universe ending Z just travels back in time to prevent him from dying by old age
1:33 & Knuckles  just a joke
Q you are not ❤️🚭

Gibt doch kein Ende ich habe die youtuber alle gedacht es gibt noch ein Ende aber es gibt noch ein Ende aber das ist kein böses Ende es ist ein gutes Ende mit f also die Vergangenheit und es ist lieb was steht da was ich meine
Thanks (z)
oh my god 😱🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
POV:loads gun points to creator listen we’re gonna get a happy ending
z rekfek da hol world bak een tam
AHA! I get it so z's tears are actually keeps the time on so the way the it goes backwards REVERSES THE TIME!!!
I don’t know how but this made me smile 😮
Hey if you make plushies then I won't see your videos like a h plushie
1:51 at 2X sounds like an even happier ending song
Welp, this went the same fate as Homestuck. But better.
I almost cried when n helped f
It's so sad and happy!
Q
FN 💓💀💀✨✨
Z did the right thing but no one knew about Z's existence.
and thats how the fn key was born
Sad
the fact when we say L to people it means "loser" and baby l just goes "L" to baby n like hes a loser
W Z
Good ending
It's interesting how F really didn't deserve all that he was just bullied and didn't know any better
I never knew this was real Challenge:  Make the whole alphabet lore with this ending
:)
I think Twinkle twinkle little star
to me personally I suggest F and N giving revenge to L and O so if you want you can make a vid of it
z/😱🥺f😍🥰☺🧡🖤💗
😢i    i.      I cant stop crying😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
🥺😨😯😱fio💢🖤🧡
Why does little Z sound like a 32 year old adult???
There’s a gummy ring that looks like O
5 million views!? In 5 days??????
I actucally learned my abcs again=
Z is a land but very huge and here have a huge blue balls that balls can reset all
Part 2 of baby?
This is so wholesome yet intriguing. We still dont know how did F's lair and all the letters generate. But i guess we gotta speculate
I like ezen Q pushin the ? Into his mouth
the real enemys are L and O for pushing f into that and everyone got mad also if Z is basically the world if he is it looks like it does that mean z was actually the fist letter and not A
1:32 ampersand moment &
Can you please keep doing it again
This is a happy ending
And f
I’m so happy of n
Hey Mike do an alphabet lore but different like with Ae oi and others just asking
We need a video on what will happen next because z changed the timeline Z is a superhero
q ended up being important
It makes me happy that my name starts with F. The best letter of the ABC.
This is so well animated I didn’t think this was the real one I’m questioning it
I wonder what Z inside his body
"and that's kids is how i met ur mother"
No way Z made a JoJo Reference.
This is the final video of Alphabet lore well I think the next one is number Lore     Like if you love alphabet lore 😭😭😭😭Good it have good ending people though this the end  👇
Z: hell nah Lets make a HAPPIEr ENding
😁Yas.       FN🫂            LMO
Who Day The Number Lore Realesed Date????
Ok ok ok now we need a season two about how N and F’s lives went.
Plsssssss  do the adult one whith f and n but there all upper case plsss in the good ending
This is such a happy ending
thats thruhe
Number lore would be cool  😎🆒
This might be the most greatest animation project you've ever made!
YES! GOOD ENDING!
i like how the first vid Q show U,G,N,A,Y,M why F actually become villian that just cool because they realize that what they do to F before is wrong then Z rewind time and let N fix the past so there no bad ending in future
The baby Z is Soo cute!
Now F good
i loved it
That's so adorable
so Q sallow a question mark gem and spits it out and show N what he has done to F so after F grown up Z was crying and then the true ending Z uses his tears to reverse time and Q give the question mark gem to N and Q was telling like N to fix the time when F became villian in future and I'm sorry this is long but I'm just saying very creative
===f="     zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz             zzzzzz           zzzzz         zzzz      zzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Can you make alphabet lore in epilogue
That's cute my guy
Ahhh
thats like the good ending
AWWWW
F dead but the eye so scary
édicamente N F eran mejores amigo pero L O y cieron algo para arruinar su amistad F queda triste y se va a una cueva que le va apernecer
K is like: k we are going back to childhood
**new vid** Next time you sing with me.
The planed wasn't happy, so it did reset the shit XD
I know why L’s the bully. L stands for “loser” and bullied n and said him he was a loser.
Bro z and Q why
F N FRIENDS
Wow cry thanks
We got a lowercase z!
Here's more of understanding the lore: After they realized they betrayed F, Z saved us in the most epic way possible, he rewinds time and goes back to the backstory, F falls to the floor, N's deciding if he should help F or stay out of this, he decides to help F, as he should then L & O does whatever the hell that was, then F & N goes to their cave, have kids(aka 4 & 7 plus what the hell??), Then we see lowercase Z, numbers, and that's where the unnoficial sequel, Number Lore starts
So has F been revived or they are living in the once more and if N had the gem from the start how did Q get it?
I wanna cry
N stole the kiss from G
N is nice
Kkk i love your animation ❤️❤️
this is so sad i can keep watching this 😭
The ending that nobody expected
Why isn’t there a cat with a remote????
Wow Q and Z fix the problem with their powers. They are so heroic
F and N and P and Z
Z rest the time line for a good ending
What??? Happy
Aww, f was trying to be friends with the other letters!
Z+Plot=time lord?
Q and Z are the MVPs of this story
I finally get to know what z looks like in lower case
Part 2 of alphabet lore?
why is everyone talking about Z and z
This is really tear jerking in a good way. Way to go Mike!
it's CUTE f and n are still friends it's Realy CUTE!😍💕
Did anyone see this? At the start of the video you will see f r i e n d s  But if you look closely you will see f u n What does f u n spell? Fun Friends = Fun
Z is the god of alphabet lore he use power to save everyone including baby z
awesome animation
I see why the letter Z can stop time.         Z-a Warudo.
😊😊😊
Zs Deep Voice I Love It.
It's The Friendship

Team F
Welp, N created a new timeline because of Z. But enemies still remain. Also but, They're friends now.
Idk if this is a mistake or not, but on 0:55 when n looks down, it is not n, it is capital N.
🥲 good ending 🥲
Why does Z still have the normal  Voice  When he’s happy
good 👍
Thanks for that I tell you another ending
Wow alphabet lore is new ending good ending
This event was about in Halloween. Also, it’s not event from me, instead, the event is my pet, is a Jack-o-lantern, he’s my pet, even he’s cute, I gave him a name, his name is Jack, good name :))
L M N O and P have powers an so does FandZ

I want to see them both beating up L and O when they become adults
Good Ending
To happy ending
I love of f and n friendship 🥲
😢😢😢
1:26 N SOUNDS SO CUTE OMGGGGG
a thout n And f weren't close friends
The fact that z was happy because he knew he fixed the timeline and prevent f on being a villain, the reason n remembers is because of Qs power when he got the ?
Technically it’s not finished because we need the next time won’t you sing with me part aswell
Awwwwwwww❤
1:50 bruh what
kyooooo🎶
and in the future... F grew up to help others and everyday N and F visited the other alphabets and they all live happily ever after.
this is why people want this ending to be added in alphabet lore
The good ending
what happened:when q showed them the question mark they all saw the past and they feel bad for f z sacrifised his old version and became lowercase and n standed up for f and they got bullied together and they lived in f house until they growed up then z became happy cus he didnt want any alphabet character to die so he reversed time and thats what happened
(^^)

Happy ending
Just made me cry at the end of those so beautiful
2 F
So That’s The True Ending? So Cute🥹
Happy ending
Ok Nice you finally did it! This doesn’t feel like you done it but I’ll take it!
N just swalowed the question mark
Damn, Zed can time travel. Probably why he is the island they live on and is like an almighty ruler behind the scenes. And what if this isn't the first time he's done this? What if he has gone back in time before to stop a disaster we don't know of.
0:33
Z and q was working together  to make f happy
F😭
Lol
Good ending:)
Now time to wait for “next time won’t you sing with me”
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
hp 2m of 0 HP Z! BOOM
Its pretty nice seeing how everybody is happy but mean how L and O make N feel scared and not letting him come up for him self but when Q and Z worked together to fix it it went like Q let N see what happened and Z reverse it all and when thay where in the past n was able to come up for f and himself he wanst scared and moved everything bad in his mind like im scared i cant to it and pushed it all away and he didnt care if hes Hurt he will just stay friends with f even if l and o dont like it
Z is
frieds
Thank you for making another one. I Love it
the true ending 🥲
Where's v?
I like how N and F don't take revenge on L and O, they just move on and live their lives. N knew he couldn't beat up L and O, so instead he took the beating with his friend and was there for him afterwards. This whole story started out as a Revenge plot, so it would have felt hollow to end with his still revenge, just of a less severe kind. No revenge here, just love
alpha bet  lore of n  gof   finale   bye   lmo  f  &  n Are going to  cave
I love how even the planet was a baby in the past
esto deveria de tener mucho apoyo por el esfuerzo de Mike Salcedo,y algunos se quejan de que nu sube video todos el tiempo (algunos)
Hopefully we can get the music out of the alphabet lore. I would really want to use some.
Z.   Is. a   Superhero
Late 4 days
The thing made me like this video is z doing reverse time
i love f for friends i miss you f😥😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😭😭
Awwww
it was great
I think 0 and L give up
F DID NOTHING WRONG
Its all thanks to Z that he reversed time and stopped F being evil (and using D to clap E)
is p actually n's sister?
A wise mexican once told me:  "now that's what you call homie-sexual"
The good ending of the alphabet lore!
How will alphabet lore serie good ending wiht old F

In the preview for the possible sequel, the title has to be "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me"... But hey! That's just a theory!
So N got to go back in time to fix the past and Q got to see the future when they was lower-case
00:17 "By The Way"

Would there be a numbers Lone
z sleeping
No wayyyyyyy
0:01   G A Y
so now theres 2 timelines. the sad ending and the good ending. n experienced both of them but the others couldnt since n was the time traveller. which means that the others are in the sad ending and even a copy of n. but they are also in the good ending so idk (ok im being a 🤓 rn)  oh and z also prob time travelled alongside with n  maybe q too who knows
Why does Q have neon white eyes in thumbnail
Make number lore
Fortunately, I dont like sad endings :)
Lol now we need “next time won’t you sing with me” as a retelling of the story now that the timeline has been reset
Make number lore please
its so coool
Number lore 1 to 20
Please make number lore please 🙏🙏🙏
.
f and n being a couple for 2 minutes and 12 seconds
Bro im crying
You should make a part 3
They both dint o anything wrong:(
When n is in a nightmare there was a lowercase coward word
SEE F IS NOT BAD!!!!!!!!!!!
0:07 q is not crying!
probably a useless fun fact: If you payed attention to everyones's power, you'll notice they are used in words, like Period, ( L' s Power) Comma,  (M's Power), semi colon (N's Power) asterisk, (X's Power)  and the rest.
i didn't expect the epilouge of alphabet lore... now there's a good ending, which is nice
Me after watching the video: Ok done No joke, me after finding out I was 1 word away from my password and logging in: OMGGGGGG THERE'S MORE *taps*  Then I wrote this comment.
Wow! I really thought it was over! That's crazy!
This honestly made me rethink about F.
So cute
n when they literaly were hit by o and l n literaly sounds cute
where is part 2?
and that’s how function notation was made
LOWERCASE Z IS HERE 2:03
Z my man let’s go!
1:24 timestamp of wholesomeness
I’M NOT CRYING YOU ARE 😭
why is the sky purple I don't know z do that
man z reversed time
Wait z's tears are time and the past and future and his tears mean he has memory hand did something wrong and with not something  wrong that means his happy
Macke alfabét lore 3
So the one that I watch along time ago at the end the was not true but this that I watch that was the true ending And it's all thanks to Z because he was the one that who reversed The world so now i know what's happening
THE HAPPY ENDING
I think I heard F. say in So is it Like Can we see like other letters because Is it the good ending because he doesn't turn evil because he got his friend
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
I love the letter k bc i love the art
Z: everyone died, its go-time *reverses time* Z: wait Q can you give N the gem? Q: sure give me 5 more years *five years later* Z: *reverses time* Q: wait take this for memory to change time N *good ending*
Aww.... So Good!They Changed The Experience :)
Thanks Z AND Q for this final(the Q for make N know all
😢😊
Wait but there is still "next time wont you sing with me"
Thank you for adding the Secret video
YES!
Baby z is chuby
I like how Z is the one to run back the clock because like think about that happens when you reach Z in the alphabet, the song ends and you start again
Waiting for “Next time won’t you sing with me” But anyways this is super exciting to see more of the alphabet
NOW EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT ZS POWER IS. ITS REVERSING TIME…thank you Z for making the end better
P just kissed N in front of G-
lol
My favorite is Q because he’s the one that knows everything
F and N is best friends
Z was sad 😭
&
Zeeeeeeeeeed   - Z Before He Reversed Time
YAY HAPPY ENDING
AWWWWWW 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
2:03 AWWWWWWW
Dont mind this comment but, abcdeghijklmopkrstuvwxyZ
I liked the episode before this as a ending because it felt like the story was finished
I watched this days before this day
n Happy f
F was trying to spell friends
Make part 3 is when they grow up it would be cool
Perfil quase parecido comigo já né já que eu sou um foco e ele também é um fofo cara e até like dê like
Z and Q knew all so Z knew it was time to make it right / Z cries power gems just like all of the other letters like F and N so his power gem makes him reverse time
Make a number lore plz
I love how P kissed n pause the video in time and press this 👉 1:50 and you will see🤭
Alphabet lore idc ending
So my theory is that this supposed to happend but it change because of N N change it ending so that why Z refresh the time Lind to make the ending come true

Them using the alphabet song in the end, I caaaaaannnttt!!,!,,,!!!😭😭😭
Because you thought it couldn't get more emotional:
f and n’s voices are to cute
If you think about it F made this all
Aww
Plot twist: Since in the first vid F was killed by N, F will stay alive and N will help F kill the other letters or just O and L, resulting in a war.  (Just a theory)
what about þ, ƿ, ȝ, æ, and œ did they just die after they were removed from the alphabet?
Make a alphabet lore the same but with letters like ch
sad ending

When you focus on the g, a and y
Plot twist: instead F becoming evil now both are evil
Wait if he wanted to make 28 alphabet vids that means...                WERE GETTING A NEXT TIME WON'T YOU SING WITH ME LESS GOOOOOOO
Wait Hol up in this ending in the future is F and N the bad guy

😮  👏( 'ω' )👏( 'ω' )
Did u know that when N is lowercase he is backwards when N is uppercase he is correct
i hate you so much L and O.
I gotta admit this storyline and stuff it all is not very hard it is hard but anyone could do it if they tried
my friends in school go zeeeeeeeeeed and then make the funny face
Z N Q

😄FXN
The song made it so it makes it EPICC
I hate this so much
F :)
Hope we can get to see more of this.☺
I just realised, If Q didn't N the ? Then the whole series could have repeated from when F tripped over N. This could have happened multiple times without anyone  (except Z) realising. ALPHABET LORE INFINITE CYCLE THEORY
COOL
Gay Gay Gay Gay N+F
Truly very sad about it ending
Can you pls make numbers anamation like this then when they see each other the numbers and alphabet lore
N: porque no le aceptais?  L: por el color   N: ·-·

Z was not happy what everything about f was doing  F was sad and he died becuse of them
Now I Know My ABCs... Thank you for Joining this Journey With Me...
Its amazing when he started with making him on. A horse to making  a hole shiw for us mad respect ill give u a kiss on the forehead and before u go to sleep heres some ideas why dont u make other universes of alphabet lores like the Chinese alphabet lore coming to the normal alphabet lore it would be a good idea
GOOD ENDING: FRIENDS
Z is for ZA WARUDO
and then N and F did the same thing and it happened all again who killed them
0:24 bro Q's eyes after seeing N ate the ? 💀
WHY THOES Z VOICE ALWAYS SOUNDS LIKE A 6000000000000 YEAR OLD MAN????????????

Time is very weird
Z Finally did something!  also I am looking forward for more of Alphabet Lore
I like happy end
Alphabet lore z is giant
I was sad because I expected that we will get some information about the letter W
YEP! THATS GOOD! 530K SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow i was think the Q was strongest letter now i see i was wrong it was Z he is strongest
OMG THE WHOLE STORY TAKES PLACE ON Z
I prefer this ending
This is enough to make a grown man cry
Z is the man that serve the universe of the alphabet
I like the way the Z going back to the past and Q made me laugh and N swallow the black gem
Finally Good Ending

0:42 pov phantom fnf
NUMBERBET LORE Edit: Also animation got better, and Z is a Dwarf Planet not a Planet
The power of ctr + z
WOW N and F and Z si 3 cool
F did nothing Rong the rest or the real cowards

As a french it's even funnier

👍👍👍👍
F and N freinds
U forgot U for fun
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️❤️♥️❤️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️❤️♥️♥️❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️❤️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️❤️😭♥️❤️❤️
1:21 N has a cute voice
Bravo bravissimo
That is the best lore alphabet video;))
Actual tears
oh my- good ending :D
now we learn how lowercase z looks like
WEEEEF😵😵😵😵😵😇Z
Z god
&
so they friend or any kind of relationship now?
I saw GUAM, GAY, and GUN in the thumbnail
this is a good ending About N Repeating the past
Alphabet Lore: the good ending
😭😭😭😭😭😭
So, just people thought this is the end, Z thinks this is all messed up, so he decided to help them to |stop Megahero N from killing F and stop F from killing other letters| (keep in mind that "|" is for the alternate future).
I think Z was a planet
Z looks like a baby 👶
&
So q is a time traveler?
Ff
Q made N have the question mark for memories Z restarted life THEY BOTH MVP
I mean like we know the past to the story we know the facts of what the characters used to be like and even we know what is Z used to look like but the one thing I don’t know is how did Z get cracks/damage to his body. So maybe you can explain that sometime I would really appreciate it.
Did you make a new Ambien one after work the Groad up and then N I am F broke up with each other because I am sick of all these years and then Z Asahd sad again what this time we can teleport to them and tell N all what happened and then N  now now N  remembers everything and then we live a happy ending😊💜
I just realized. what would it be if F captured N instead? what does F do when he collects R,I,E,N, and D?
There should be number lore now
So, the ellipsis stones can make whatever is inside the sphere it creates, go back in time.
🥺😭😭😖fn❤
Pls create more
YYYOOO
Now this time instead of just f now n joins f beating beaten up but stillfriends
Look how cute Q stands
You can tell people are invested in your series when an installment gets 5 million views in 4 days.
F
Quuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀uuuuuuuuuuu
will theres more alphabet lore videos?
YES AN HAPPY ENDING
Omg fentastic
everyone thank to z its because he reversed time and made it a happy ending now :)
Its amazing how n got to change everything he did wrong in the past without f becoming bad. M and f are just what we can call the best of friends, they care so much for each other 🥲🥲🥲
The end 🌟🌇🌟
So did they become outcasts together?
P is alive and well and that is all i needed to know
Imagine a baby Z with the deepest voice humanly imaginable.
😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
i really sad at f deafts but i love the ending
👍👍
Z now • ).
When z used his power every letter turned lowerecased even z
0:08 frieds
Omg...itd amazing
This is one of the best vids of alaphabet lore ever!!!!!
P KISSES N YASS
THANKS N 😊
I like K's reaction to the restart ring thing.
Now Its Time For "Alphabet Soup" Lore!
It's like a great story to watch n and f became friends n help f
when Z have the blue gem why he didn't even charged that
top
n is so cute:3
The way that q and z was at with a team and they forgot that f was nice and n was trying talk to them but they dont know what n is talking about
so sad😢
it's the final of alphabet lore but Z's dad is putting his gem to go back to baby time and Z's dad power.... now Z is a baby..........
Good ending 😃
omg that's him! Z is a baby now!
Bro got the good ending 😊
SUBSCRIBE TO MIKE!!
Nice gay endinf f and n gay
Its always their kind to get bullied -👴🏻
This is just sad 😭 😢
Z was resetting the world to make n make a change
Q has telikanisis power
This series has potential, I feel it
:)
This is so happy and happy z but small
N has unlocked the [Good Ending] Achievement
I thought z was just so far away from the base, but he is literally the world
This got more views then the original. Dang
Wath? Z is an World? Wow!
i just realize baby Z is bigger than adult Z💀
I just realized that in the prolouge, Z says “Zeend” and in the epilouge he says “zeeg”
Fn
The orbs z has In the og is his tears that when he gets 3 of them he can go back in time it's also funny that were invested in the alphabet
14
Z was only 500,000,000,000 when he was lowercase
Im cryin bro this is so emotinal😭😭😭😭
And f die
Okay everyone khow that Z cry be all ABC not friends with F
so Z and Q where working  together for somebody to go in the past and make f happy but then they both get punched and hurt but they still kept a smile because n was so kind that he was there to rescue f and also n hugged  p because when they were caps lock L and O were bullying N but then P comes in and saves N so in the past n hugged p and went to f mounten  wat a great ending wow
Al
thank you Z
CHEER FOR Z!
F.......
1:13 sounds like universal studios

Aw damn g is still depressed💀
i like how z timetravels back in time so n and f will still be friends
Me after taco bell
I almost cry
Cheap your Love
Now we're waiting for "next time wont you sing with me" which would probably be a recap of the entire alphabet lore series but someone sings the context
n your not a coward
z: ima reverse time…. kyoo give him the question mark kyooo: EAT THIS BOI WE GONNA REVERSE TIME BABY
.;:comma...!? gems
Now N and F they are living with a distance Instead of being F alone  Good
Q like big brother because she help Z and N to wipe the problem
good ending
I hope there are more parts cuz this series is too good
Can y’all be honest Z looks cute as a kid.
1:42
We need a number lore now
Twist:after that vision F comes back to life and has a different personality C: and I become Z (bec my real name starts with Z!)

Lowercase z
Me bilike; finally happy ending, and new episo
Planet Z
z STILL GOT THE DEEPEST VOICE
Can you make an adult version of this. Pls
And l,m,o promised f
All of the letters are sad but if they turn lowercase f fell when n is mad to l and o and l bump f o bump n and their tears had love and p kissed n and f and n became together and it ends to z to be happy
N x f
0:58 G that gets in front of n is adult, but later g is a kid, means n remembers his fear and now he is beating the fear
😃😍
XD Lmo
Maybe F was just the Friends we made along the way
sooo.... Z’s power is to reset time?
I had a dream about Z in 10/26/2022, and it also involves Melony from the YouTuber SMG4
Yes nnnnnnnnnnnn
Yeaaaa, good ending
I like baby z
thats so cool
This was so cute and lighted up my heart even more
A AlIj J

Now that is the true ending
F looked like a proud farther
If Z is a planet, then Y will be considered as the last letter
Z belike: ok nice no more chaos anyways now i can go to sleep xd
thought this wasnt original but it is
♡
This is the Greatest epilogue all time
Its very heart warming. When Z reversed time to save N from killing F. n really has the courage.
all the letters: F only wants a friend, and we kill him I cant beleve it Z: I really meed to do evrything myself? K: What the...? L and O: What is that?  B T W: Thats akward Q: Uh oh! N take this with you N: Q what are you do- Speeds down time till lowercase letters n: Hey! Thats the same place f:  AAAAAAA n: Uh oh! f: n, help me please! l m o appears n: Not agian! remembers Looks down Saw the word "coward" n: Not anymore! G: Dont get closer n pass G l o appears l o: get back n: Never! n pass l and o f looks up Saw n front him f: n, how did You pass them? l m o got so confused f: Im so happy n knows he is NOT a coward l and o got mad and then atacks f and n f and n:  We dont care If l and o atack us f and n falls f: Guess now i have a friend n:  True! Swaps n: Get up f f: Hihi Gets to fs cave  n and f hits g n run to p n: Thanks p for Your kindness! p: Ur so nice n gets a Kiss from p f:  Lets go Both gets to fs cave f and n: Where so happy z: Aww look who just has a friend! z sleeps Finishes ending

I love how Q and Z work together to fix the friendship and the lowercase Z is so cute and don’t have cracks he has cracks because an meteor or is it and where he get the power to reverse time before f drop the lmnop gems so a meteor hits lowercase z so is not an meteor is an gem so the gem looks like a time ball and it has heated and the gem makes z powers sooooo the gem speads time power to z to activate the time power z needs to get the 3 cyan ball to get it z needs to cry and make it or z gets a meteor and turn the meteor to cyan ball so it can reverse time orrrr stop time orrrrrr travel time
1:21-1:28 idk why i like that part
Please number lord
Z it's crying because he lost one of his letters so he travels back in time to babies
Can you make episode 3 ple pleeeeee 🥺🥺🥺
F did notfing rong
the good ending
oh gosh they will milk it again....

Mike Salecdo Make Number Lore
😢Fñ
Vale F E D C B A
BEST. ENDING. EVER!!!!!!!! honestly i wasn't expecting you to make this but THANK YOU! my night has been made more than any other night
LET'S GOOOOO I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A HAPPY ENDING IT HAS CAME TRUE
Z never ages since back then when all the letters were baby’s he was old and since at the past again z was finnaly a kid.
Emotional damage 💔 😢
Final alternative
Q and Z are working the whole time when f was k!lled
FINALLY A BABY VERSION OF Z
Next time won't you sing with me...
This is absolute genius! I love how you saved the most powerful of the marks for last, where Z is the guardian of the ellipse, which perfectly embodies time, given how often it is used to represent a pause within dialogue and a bridge between two points in a quotation. And a bridge goes two ways. This is an amazing series, and very well executed. So glad I found it! :D
Did Z just pull out a Made in Heaven?
I love it🥰🥰🥰🥰
ph happy Z
OH I SEE alphabet 1!!!
I don’t get what the tear punctuation gems mean. Like… what is their significance and where do they come from.
Ok stop it is alphabet lore 2
😁👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
ABCDEF is the best and don’t forgotNAll is the best I like them so much if only if that really happened really be good I’m happy
i love the QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ
I'm not joking, the alphabet lore is straight up overrated, I'm not lying.
When i saw this, I was so exited that he realeased a new alphabet lore
Wow! 😳 I didn't know that Z could turn back time! It's a good thing that Q threw the question mark in N's mouth. N wouldn't have realized and learned to stand up for F otherwise. Now that is what I call a twist happy ending. 😊
Why it is alphabet lore
One question
Can you add part 3 tomorrow please I wasn't to see what did they do on Happy ending but the litter are big boys and girls
We need number lore
Just realized something In nZ, someone commented the meaning of each tear symbol, but didn't explain why Z had ..., Which means suspense, that there was more all along, but now, there's nothing around Z, meaning that it's the end, now N has a happy ending, F has a happy ending, and Z, the world on which every other letter lives in, has a happy ending.
Do number lore
Z went back in time to change what happended
Q made N swallow the ? So he has the power to remember so that’s why l O And M and the others was bulling them still “ this is just a theory
Owwwww this soy kiut
The internet is going to get wild.
Me iso llorar 😢😢😢😢😢
😮it is nice how z and q were working together 😮 z is cool and wend is a Baby he so he have no Crack
Do 1 more but n end f kill l end o cuz frick them
I am so happy that this series didn’t pull a hfjONE on us and ended on a depressing cliffhanger. This is the best thing I’ve witnessed so far.
That was sooooo good I'm literally about to cry
It was so beautiful
Sonu çok güzel
Make a lower case f plushy
so happy <3
I want to season two  They add words  Or numbers the numbers will bully the letters since there's infinite numbers
The semi colon and exclamation point made an & symbol
Can you do another series where in there timeline that n stood up to f and they are together but what happens in the future what about L and O being the real villains of this arc
🤡
When they getting hit: E again: EEEEE me: E GANGG
Wow is Like a continue i never see that continue i Like it to much 😄😊
Z it's like z said ggggg
I kinda want more
Ok 1. Why was z like in crackes in the further? And 2. Why is baby z SO DAM CUTE
Uh season 2 letters vs numbers?
I WASN’T EXPECTING THIS!! Q and Z are life savers…
I love this ending💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️
Q's eyes: 👀👀👀👀👀👀 N's eye pupils:❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔❔
I am happy crying 😭
Oye una pregunta en estos vídeos por que no aparece la Ñ
I think they all need some pie
KIOOOOOOOO! N: GULP* and a bunch of other stuff happened
But what happens in the future
the ending is all we need to know what happened or fix the pass life
You see f isent that bad
The true ending is kinda good
Now we goted Z lowercase design, screw the 5 year Olds who made a bad lowercased Z design.
This all would’ve been solved if they spelt “man”
New letters Ã ß Œ Č Ë Ÿ Ū Į Æ Š Ł Ž Č Ń
Z z
wow it's so cool z come back again  to baby and f n become best friend
The good ending, achieved
Good video
so when z is happy it = good ending in part1 at the end z is sad because there was chaos but z wanted peace a nomal a-z video and when z is sad it = bad ending
Can you make the season two pls
It made me cry
BTW
I never knew Z had this kind of power.
taht really cute
You make the part 2 whit babis
So basically Z rewind time and order for N to nato make the mistake he did in the original video so does that mean the present day has been changed?
I think im gonna cry
Falto la Ñ
my son's name starts with Z
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
yes part 2
good ending wnd to bad ending
Make the number pore please
I knew Z would do something
The best ending ever       edit: my name starts with a J
Next time won't you sing with me
We got the good ending
&
So that’s *Z* well it seems that Z is the creator and wants all letters to be kind to all. (Edit) he finally changed it all. No one will kill. And they lived happily ever after. The end I think 🤨
I want alphabet lore 2
HELL YEAH
I KNEW IT THEY WERE LIVING IN Z WHEN I SAW F’S BASE ON Z’S HEAD I KNEW THEY WERE LIVING ON HIM
Awesome video!!!!
May you make an alternate series?
1:30 why the black gem is not a question mark its a explanation mark

As You Can See They Live On Z, But Where Does Z Live In? in the background it is white like  Z so I would guess he lives on a gigantic solar system letter that's white.

M AND G IS BIGGER THEN EVERYONE
Z IS SO CUTE THO
1:29 when the ; and the ? cross each other, it makes an &, which means F&N. I got curious, so I spelled "F&N" on Google and I found a YouTube result called "F&N - Future" Future! Because they are all young now and in the FUTURE the will be older! I don't know if this was a coincidence or not! Also, I loved everything about this Alphabet lore story, and I'm so happy to see everything work out in the end. Thank you so much for making this, Mike. I will never forget my ABC's again. :)
Chapeleiro 3

Z: “I did it I save the world”
Do will you sing with me  next it’s where z and h creates a heaven could where h comes back and makes it to the moon and collects it togther to the sun and makes a nuke marking all the letters fall and puke
It's the ending we wanted we need that ending maybe in the future for an animation that has more history of alphabet Lore
I'm thinking about and a second z (like a new island)
I just imagine a rick roll appears as soon as Z is about to undo the bad ending
That’s a good ending that n helped f :)
I like how F is dead in the background
Q in the thumbnail:I am GOD 👹👹👹👹
*crys* Ahh well that happened
Yea thank you z & q but don’t you wants to know what Happens to l & o
Top 10 cutest things in this video 10: Z fixing everything 9: K just flying and seeing the ring 8: N standing up for himself 7: F and N make another symbol 6: F and N running 5: THOSE BABY LETTERS 4: G still getting ran over 3: N hugging P and giving her the gem she has 2: BABY Z 1: P kissing N (that is downright adorable)
F did nothing wrong F was trying to make Friends
z: fix time lind    f and n : thx  Z : np :)
Wow
look how cute is p is
Cool
Good job on Q for giving N the black stone when time was reversing lol
Here's the story. Picture if you will. It starts of by Z and the letter & (& was a letter believe  it or not) Had 7 children. A B C D E F G. 1 year later they had  4 Children H I J K. And then 1 year later they had Quintuplets. L M N O P. 2 years later they had Q R S. Q was a smart boy. But was to slow to show his intelligence. 1 year later they had T U V. And 1 year later W X Y. They had 25 children. But  sadly & Had an accident in the Galaxy. She got hit by an asteroid. She died 1 year later. She was the one in control of the letters not fighting each other. Z had a tough time with the children. When the letters F R I E N D S. Became friends. Z loved it. But he saw two of his Quintuplets L and O. Who then shot N with O. F and N were best buddies. F got revenge and grabbed A R and T to spell out FART behind L. All the kids laughed. L and O got revenge by simply pushing F into the letters R I C K spelling FRICK.  This upset all the letters and began to beat up F. Z saw this and couldn't do anything About it. Since the letters lived on his head and & could float around. She could break them up. But as Z was crying he made Dots to create an Ellipsis.  Later N betrayed F By simply being a Coward. F ran away and dropped six gems . , : ; ! * These gems were powerfull. He even dropped ?. This gem told future and past Q later ate the gem and saw the future of F seeking revenge. He had been trying to warn them until adulthood but was to slow. F later seeked revenge. Killing C X H J P. F later died by N killing him with all the gems. * And ? Were not included. Q showed them this would happen.  Z saw this and cried. He had to to something. Because he watched 6 of his children dead.  He worked with his smart son Q. They reversed time to make N stand up for F before betraying him. N dropped ; and F dropped ?. They became best friends and Z could live happy ever after.
0:18 its said BTW (by the way)

If you ask me, I think lowercase z is adorable
P3?
snif . . . snif . . snif ... bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa hahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa its soooooooooooooooooooooooooo sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeheheheheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Does any one notice the gems
F ando N. Friends now
I really liked that because F is bad and needs  to be good. Congratulations @mike salcedo
Omg this fixed the story so well,n is not a coward and helps f
Lower Casey z
I just realized that when the question mark and the semicolon came together, they created the "&" symbol
0:23 the way Q put the ? In N,s mouth😭✋
z is sooooooooooooooooooooooo  cute
nice
N & F
👍90k
happy ending
It's good that you finally found a lowercase Z design
Awww
Plod twist: Then N joined F to become villians together
Hey can you make a series of the alphabet lore pls
I wish there was more...
We need the numbers sequel fr man
I liked the part when Q said QQQQQQ!
Baby z
😊😊😊
When I saw the bad ending of this, I started to tear up. But now we should all thank Z for making this ending really matter.
I like when the first part when lower case n looked at f but when f saw the word coward
The ellipsis stone gives z the power to reverse time, I think Q saw this coming from the question mark stone so he gave it to n so he would have it in the past, otherwise time would loop around and start all over again, chances are the reason why there were 3 dots is because the time had looped 2 times before, so after the alphabet lore we watch, Z cries the final dot, and an ellipsis is normally a pause before something happens which is why Q gives the question mark stone to N, that is the thing that happened after the pause, it also resets to the very first timeline because young Z doesn’t have any stones around him, that is the lore of the epilogue of alphabet lore, you’re welcome
normally when there is a sad ending in youtube parodies it would just be sad but at least you made an additional part giving a good and a bad ending to this parody
While Z reversed time Q gave N the ? To have his memories
GV (good video) Mike, 14/10
даааа
Like para parte 3 :)
good ending
When I first saw this video I thought it was from a fan… until I saw that this was made by Mike, the creator of the original video.
I need to see what the new uppercase N would look like
what about h tho
What happened to V?
Like
YES
Thanks for my comment of the part 2
FN
This is a part 2?
Bad intro
I knew that z ... had to be a gem!
Awwwwww love this 😊
Q and Z Know The Truth...
B
The good ending is the whole point reason why n x f exist💀
all of your videos are SUCKS because... System_error
Do a video of what the letters do when you are not watching the alphabet lore
Ey! Hola ya me acuerdo que las n y f fueron juntos a la cueva de f
Technically every alphabet lore character is alive in this present day because they went back in time :D
I live the smile on fs face when n hours him
I love when kju and zed are Working together kju was only one that can see the times zed can do back in time and kju River him the story at his Mind and n  was only One that can help.
in the intro says '' gany'' or' 'g$y' '
This is makeing me very sad right now
Wow is this part 2 i watch part 1
E P I C
Final: K sees Z power and fly L and O sees power B and T and W Sees power
f and n hmm maybe it mean   friend  or  friend for fun
Song name of the start?
I hate l and o,I want another secret ending like the normal one but with n and f Killing there and then they the become good please
Everyone reading this say F for him to come back to continue alphabetic lore
Alphabet Lore 28 Oct 2022
Honorable getting bitten up
frist it was sad:( but now its good!:)
so does this mean everything that happened was N's fault?
(: happy ending for F
If only
Good final
Yay happy end :D
THIS IS SO SWEET!
i like the part when Z said "Its Z,ing Time" And Zeed all over the place
I LOVE THIS VID ITS AWSOME
Good ending
it’s so happy🥺👍F N❤
This is a happy ending N did not betray F😭it makes me want to cry
Wheres the I Becoming alive?
That was the most amazing ending!!!! I watched the first Alphabet lore and how it ended was the absolute worst but now to they got to make more!!!!!! The suspense is killing me.
lucky q if q did not make it in time it would be a time loop.
Unpopular opinion, I liked the ending better without this. It’s kinda cliché and the original ending was much more unique. When I saw it I was really sad, but after seeing this I was just kinda like “oh, ok then”
Awwwwww  so fucking cute, I wish they'd do it on the real show!!!
Z finally made me proud
Finally z did something
Nooo I want more!
The Future of each letter in normal timeline: A: Try to cure B B: Searching help. D: Likely Deceased from starvation E: Likely Deceased from starvation G: Lost its woman. I: Either confused or traumatized. K: Probably would continue with its normal life. L: Its reputation will be in a big trouble. M: Becomes close to N N: Possilby without clear objective in life. O: Its reputation will also be in a big trouble. R: Possibly becomes friend with S S: Possibly becomes friend with R T: W would likely try to heal him. U: Probably becomes friend with V V: Probably becomes friend with U W: Would try to heal B and T Y: Lost its man.  Main Funerals (If there are): C, P, X.  Remaining powers: - Asterisk - Question Mark - Elipsis points. - Tittle
Good job thank you for a happy ending
So ? + ; = &
Now this is what you call an good ending! Every time i saw the ending from the other video I felt so bad for F and I was like "F never deserved that, what jerks they all deserved that!" and now sense  Z reversed time F can live a happy life :)  Edit Note: Z reversed time to give F another chance to have a normal life and not to be a lonely mean letter that had a tough time in the past
Can we have another apple blog
Absolute cinematic masterpiece better than any marvel movie and I haven't even watched a marvel movie before
Fun fact: when the ? And ; gemstone scene appears they get together and they forms into a & here's the truth 1:31
Badge: Restarting lore Fix your past as Q gives you a chance to do it
most likely mike might not make even more creative movies, which makes us sad
The ending everyone didn’t know they need but secretly needed
THATS SO ARDOERABLE
Make a part 3 plzzzz
YES, THE GOOD ENDING
To be honest if it didn't have this then that would mean he could've let him viewers make their own ending to the series
You Can make F But Happy like the Alphabet Lore?
this series started with a simple, "AYYYYYYYY" but it eventually moved to lore, starvation,death,combinations, superpowers,getting shot, flashbacks, betrayal,and in the end everything is fixed, this series broke our hearts and fixed them back, thanks to Mike salcedo for making this series, a series we didn't want, but we needed and this series made my 2022 all the sweeter
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Part 3 pls pls  part 3 pls pls pls pls pls sow cry 😭😭😭

Do you Remember that Babies Song? 1:57
🥺🥺 gracias N eres el mejor

what happens next?
Our first look at lowercase Z! Very cool!
Idk why in tik tok make F and N simp
add a u into the f n you make fun and thats what F and N will have for they're lives
WE SAW NOW BABY Z
OMG I DIND'T KNOW THAT Z CAN DO ANYTHING😰FINALLY THEY NOTICE THAT F DID NOTHING WRONG😥
The Most Heartwarming Ending A Cartoon Could Ever Have…
So sad 😭
We finally got happy ending
Basically, Z wanted to make the wrong right, so did Q, when Z used his gem to make the wrongs right, Q forced the gem into N, and N was supposed to make his wrong things right. So he ditched L, O and M and went with F. After that F became more friendlier and we got to see baby Z. This is the best ending possible thanks to Q and Z.
I’ve seen this
Do season 2 of alphabet lore
Hello. You have an discord server?
We cannot forget that the letter G has a 3rd G design
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Numbers lore is aproxim?

Amazing! Wheres number lore?
all thanks to z... for the good ending
Z feels like the most powerful letter now
THANK GOODNESS NOW THAT F AND N WILL BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN
This was the Real ending we needed
The fact that n and zs tears made  a & symbol is so cool
Who would have it guessed, us crying for letters of something usually for children.
Z save F live
Z is a baby
Why do I feel like there's going to be a true final episode "Next time would you sing with me"
Time*
I just found out the power of Z is reverse tiem
BRUH ITS CRINGE 5 YEAR OLD KIDS LOVE THIS
Q know Z plan :0
This video.. The entire Alphabet Lore... is legendary. I cried after seeing the original alphabet lore, but this one makes me cry even more. Z is the planet we all needed, and if we lived on Z, Alphabet Lore would finally be the GOAT of YouTube.
Guys Z is for Zeus and Z is the god of alphabet
finally, we see how z looks like when he was a kid.... he is the same
Do think Z and Q are working together
I noticed that Z doesn't have tears when he was young
Alphabet lore 2 lol
This was a great epilogue
Excuse me, why is A, G, And Y near each other? You know what that makes right?
This is a really good series
Ahora ya me calmé por la venganza de F Okay Qué es que se iba a vengar

N is just now to help f now they say today!

God ending
I hope that after n and f die they go to heaven and it makes me cry so sad it turns out that f is bullied by lm and o after the happy ending finally n knows what to choose a friend or who bully him and n knows if you have to choose a friend rather than being bullied I really like it I hope this channel reaches 100 million subscribers, hopefully the news is good, brother, you don't have a fever and are healthy, always make videos and always be active, yes, this is my opinion for you, bro, the animation LORE AZ
Now I will officially change my favorite character to z
THIS IS THE ENDING WE ALL NEEDED THANK YOU MIKE
This is the my favorite ending
I'm sorry F 😢
Only 4,000,000 people watched that

I just realized that all the gems are all the punctuation marks
Q put that ? Into n like a pill. THAT WAS CRAZY HERE ARE THE SOUNDS Z:*big ring forms* Q:KYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH N:*swallows gem* COWARD G WITH F FACE then passes the bullies
This Is the happy Ending
I really wish the next part is a number lore

This is just so wholesome
There's one thing left to do: Teaching the bullies l and o a lesson for the bullying there did to f! I thought Q could warp back in time but Z did it every time but Q always forgot to let N swallow the ?-gem. This time Q remembered this.
Little n is SO CUTE!

I just realized, F is the only black, or the dark color, THAT SEEMS VERY RACIST! But good thing N isnt racist, even though hes the first word of the N word.
This is a happy ending
lol imagine f and n coming to get revenge together 😂😂
I bet when I read the Q and Z were working together that is true. and umm I don't know I thought when they time travel and n in the dark place I said baby N... ok let's just start you can see in the dark place in her eyes you can see baby F and adult F in different ways that one is sad but now we can see baby Z🥰🥰🥰
we have true good ending and true bad ending wheres good ending and bad ending
Bro Z and Q just changed the past!
Guys!I now the secret of Q.Q is working with Z to help all the letters to not fight but L and O are always bad and bullies about F,N is so nice to and how did Q now Z is the planet is Q a time letter and an astronaut Q is so cool but some people hate Q.Q is helping not hating and Z is cracking you see the cracks in Z of the first ending of the first alphabet lore ending but when he is a baby Z douse not have any cracks alphabet lore has a lot of secrets
Everyone saying "Thanks Z" but without Q, N wouldnt know about the futur so nothing else would change 🗿
Wait... Only now i understand that Z is a big planet
Whaat! Her video alphabet lore but kids is getting z,s son
Z is 2 deferent by me and these people arcopey me to z and Z

Next time won’t you sing with me…  It’s very weird first what happens to everyone before the time travel yeah n it’s fine but what about everyone else before the time travel it happens to them there’s so much I just hope that everyone will be fine in the real world and in the alphabet world
Thank you so much for doing more parts of alphabet! It was Very nice of you! (new  sub)

the story is short but cool
Awh what a happy ending, Z finnaly did something with Q and make everything not F’s fault but O and L’s fault ❤
Best end
F x S
I'm so happy 😇😇😇😇
pls nex
😄 f n  f 💔 n💔⭐✨f 💖 n
fn
f
This is so good and sad 😭
PPL: cries tysm for saving the world z!! me: yes, thanks to him, wait, whhats this? *click* WAIT WHY IS N AND F K-
I cannot believe Q and Z working together to the first time
I just realized that the powers of every letters are actually the dots like for P it’s the exclamation mark for Z is the three dots for L it’s he dot for O it’s the 2 dots for X it’s that thing *  N is for the dot and the comma M is for the comma and finally F has the question mark
I was tearing up at the end because the ending is so sweet! :)  Finally n stand up for l and o and baby z is adorable! Also, f and n have swap gems?
He really did say,I know my abcs
best endingg
There should be a bonus video called "won't you come play with me" and it's just the normal abc song
So when Z was about to undo to when they was lowercase you see an easter egg that was found, the alphabets looking at the sky was actully when F dies, and also when B T and W spells “BTW” when they were looking at the sky
In the p part when n hug p and like "thank you" it made me cry
the B,T,W
Pliss make tru ending
This is I realize the Z makes the "&" Which Letter will set to return be a kid.
wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy better
PLZ more
Thank You
You should do something like this but with numbers like up too 10 20 or smt
Uh oh spaggito
This is a good ending :)))
Z before:i cant do anything Z now:UMLIMITED POWER

Spooky scary skeletons spooky scary skeletons they’re really scared by where does your cousin know this movies because 🎃

yay 😭😢
umm there are two Fs
z
Sad😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢
Q IS POOP
When a 17 minute series by a YouTuber is better than a 47 hour series on Netflix:
Good ending
Mixed feelings about the decision to give things a nice and happy ending, but still an incredibly well put together and satisfying conclusion.  Nice job.
Gay Ending XD
Gay Endine XD
They live on z?
Btw I did not even notice q and z are working together
I think if there's a number lore zero will be the planet the numbers are on than possibility the two planets z and 0 collide
Can you please make a series about their adventures as kids?
You indoing you koooooooooppooooo
The reference like from rainbow and cry balls bc k, l and o and btw are looking through sky
You you hahaha
2:03 happy ending
Soo cute this is like the happy ending right because like the other one was like the you now like the bad ending right
This is cute now
The secret ending
.,;:?!*   ...
Such a happy ending now f is not lonely
I want to see an :| witch restarts a letters action

This is better now Best ending
I guess true ending
Lol No

the end
(Beat at the end: now I know my abcs.. next time won’t you sing with me..
They’re safe from f❤️‍🔥
I thought Z past away but he did not l was surprise
Wow epic moment toss
Finally real lowercase Z
What just happened
Happy ending :)  For now
Ta chidoel final bueno
😿Is sooo tragedy
Good ending
Pls make more of the alphabet lore😭😭😭😭
Here’s the real question. Where is “next time won’t you sing with me”
Z and Q were working together to make the alphabet stay safe they are heroes
A beautiful ending indeed
If the future of bad ending F dies but what's the future of good ending?
This ending is so……………… beatiful…
Message to @Calix Magwawalis  Shut up and nobody cares
That’s actually the true ending 😊
L  is  scaredcat
L is scaredcat
is it just me or did I just hear F saying "thanks" instead of his name
Is cute and funny how z looks like lower cased and is very happy to see the first alpahbet lore wasn't the end and I will love to see more❤
Thank you for showing us the finale we got a good ending :) Z was like: im tired of this :/ *REVERSE* wait that means that the timeline there now they formed FRIENDS again! But Z’s voice is VERY CUTEEEEEEEEE
good ending
F:(
I knew why do Z was reversed time. Because, Z was already know F is so bad while growing up. That's why Z have plan to reverse the time.
Much Better
@Calix magwawlis do you need a doctor? are you possesed?
i never thought the alphabet lore would have a good ending
He should make one where they discover that they live on Z.that would be cool
For some reason I think there’s the numbers beyond the alphabet and zero is the planet of the numbers
What happend next? I can wait to see
I didn't think I'd be crying over alphabet letters, and yet here I am. 😭 This story says a lot about what it means to stand up for a friend. And also that the ones that got their powers were the ones that deserved them instead of L and O getting them. I can't say why not for M or X, but the only reason I can think of is it could've been hard to narratively fit into the epilogue, plus they didn't die in the tragic way that P did. Q being able to deliver the question mark to N so that they remembered in the past-- I could go on and on about how beautiful this was. This healed my heart for both F and N as well as P and G, thank you. 💖   Edit: In my original comment I was wondering if this was planned, but then that was answered in the description. I'm really glad this was the creator's intention all along. 🥰
F has N's power
🤗🤗🤗🤗
3?
guys F forever right now baby F😭😭
thank you Z for reverse everything on you and Q for giving the question gem ability to N
P is sure N's mom
😭
Espanis hola soi de mexico
That was super sad
HAPPY Family From f in n GOODBYE
h is floating?????
We need all a lowercase be happy at them
I think this is the happy ending
I am SO happy they made another ending
Alternate title: Alphabet Lore Good Ending
*claps*adorable and sad at the same time <3
2:05 and here it is, lowercase Z!
1:50 Me trying to pause the video at the right moment got me like...
:D
F did nothing wrong
Happy ah moment
1:16 goofy ah moment
If this isn't one of the best anime in history then I don't know what is.
Omg yeeesss! I needed this it is too sad to end like that
1:17 <:)
Fun fact: z technically does not say z perfectly because if you listen close enough he says Z’d
the good ending
Do any of you feel bad for F? He’s the most bullied character, and grew up to MURDER THE LETTERS. But everyone deserves a second chance, right? (Even letters)🎃
What a happy Ending
I cried while watching this
When Z reveals his power
You should do the number lore 1-100 like when you made that short of 7 eats 9
Bf: sadsadssdasaxdssadsdfxdsfdsdfdsdfsdsffsdsfdsdxsfazfasfasfasfsfasafsfaxafsfasfdadadfadfdfadfadfaaxfxssdasdasdsddsddasfdasadfsafzfzdaxdqfasdafdafadfadfadafadfadfsasfasfasfsafsadfadfadfafdadfasdfadfzfdsafaxxfxadsaf---
So sad 😢
Next time won't you sing with me
I'm crying but who is the real hero N,Q or z? But in everybody's heart it's all of them
The end was good

Good ending
I know you guys are so ronz invaded his self to make it better and he just make to the back start of the regis watch hello guys listen to me see in both is so to be better and now there's no more cracks
welp, its done
This was the true story about n and f. So when they where uppercases f hurts d e r and t that got stuck at the ground and z and Q help together to go back when they where lowercase and n so cowndar to see in the water and went to f and became friends together so I think n will be nice to f soon
Baby Z
Z and Q is working together
I love it
Well actually f it's the same size as p
ABC
I want to see how this ends up when they’re older
make a song one PLZEE
I think p is supposed to be a teen because do you know p is the biggest letter
He stood up for himself now
This was a little sad
Wait does this mean that they are F'N each other
I like this ending way better it’s better then f being all alone and all the letters against him keep up the work maybe we can even get a hole series about this
UHH I FIND THE WORD GAY IN THUMBNAIL
Do you know why f and n are best friend? Cuz a word friend there f and n on it so that's why
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’m honestly surprised by the fact A survived the entire story, even to the point of reset.
wanted it to change and he changed it
N YOU CAN DO IT DO ANYTHING FOR F HE HELPED YOU LAST VIDO YOU AR NICE PORSEN
This is so sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
the end the alphafet
Yay Z Said F x n
FINALLY WE KNOW WHAT BABY Z LOOKS LIKE XD
I just thought that Z was just far away
WOW ALL THE OTHER ABC
awesome..
:D
😍🥰❤
*sniff*sniff* I love F
I'm just going to say to z thank you for reversing the world because you if you weren't there then the world will end in f but and thank you so much now his life is going to change
Z was like lowercase now i see his reveal when Z is little
Z sounds like he's about to say Nutella
i would like a chapter 2
Wow, so that's now the true ending
MCU and DCU are nothing compare this story with a nice lore made with love
What am I watching?
bro I'm crying with this ending
1 question why is q shocked
Yaaaaa good ending I thought is bad ending
My favorite letter is n and f
WOW! That's Is The Best TV Program Ever! Thanks Mike!🤩
the last one is a good ending
Mike is nice but why they not unchaining the letter that are kidnapped by f ?
Now I know my ABC’s next time won’t you song with me
Part2 pls I wanna see the future of this outcome
Wait, THAT MEANS F AND N ARE GOING TO TAKE REVENGE!
what a sad orgin
THIS MAKES ME WANT TO CRY ;)
O ma ga😢 this was so good
Make baby lore March and  I'm sad
very good ending :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
p
Now the real question begins. How will the story change with this 1 little time loop?
I died
I spot gay
Me waiting for “Next time won’t you sing with me”
0:04 Is it just me that thinks F is a *bit* scary here?
Small N: yep I’m here to deliver p’s gem also
parte 2 plsssss ;-;
Have the other letters ever met Z?
This is the ending that everyone needed and the fact Z turned back time for N to change of being a coward is very heartwarming of Z to do something like this just to make his fellow letters happy. :)
so i guess the power of the ellipses is to turn back time

Literally a movie, fantastic
Finnaly! Lowercase Z!
Now what would happen if F was the good guy and N became the villain, how would this effect the Alphabet Lore ending.
0:09 "FRIEMDS"

Z and Q are the useful letters 👌✨

Ñ
AWWWWW
DUDE FINALY PART 2 IS HERE
Now we get why Z was crying the whole time, now the timeline is fixed its happy 😭
@manucraft
Im so glad this came out..now I don't have to question what happened after
If there is a
Watch alphabet lore from 13:30 to 13:59  Then watch the epilogue for alphabet lore from 00:31 to 2:11, it’s like there was never an epilogue and n never hid behind O.
VERY A++++++++ LOVE :)))))
Z was like: nah there no way ima let this end like this am reversing time.
It’s also nice to now that n’s question mark and f’s simble was dancing together. Who would now?
This ending filled the whole in my heart
POV: you got the happy ending
Z is now happy boi
I can’t believe that z used his tears to rewind time and q gave n the question mark so n could see the future and help f so he’s not bad. It’s like q and z are working together.
My boy q
HAPPY ENDING
it made me cry😢
1:32 &
Request Next time won't you sing with me
This ending is truly amazing… Now F doesn’t go all psycho and now he has his best buddy N. Again truly amazing ending..
Necesita una segunda parte
I like the happy ending
akhirnya good ending
Finally baby z
Im crying and happy at the same time 😭
llytad.  wodgouy tered gou bot mn nf (;
Wow. I didn't expect that.
Just asking
So whose the male and whose the female in this relationship
Da good ending :D
getting baby z was cool
made me cry in sight plz get me to animate
Why is l m o is bullied n and f
Pt 3??????
F did nothing wrong why
What a wonderful video I hope there aren’t any bots in the comments
This ending right here shows that F is not actually a bad letter and now he has a friend to hang out.. N is a good letter for being there for F. I bet when they grew tall, F is won't be bitter, he will be a happy uppercase F with sharp teeth.
Best ending bro you deserve an oscar for this
WOW THE TRUE ENDING? OR IS THIS THE GOOD ENDING AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE BAD ENDING
EEEEEEAAAAF
This this made a tear drop from my eye🥲
Happy f looks goofy
The other letters didn't even care that F was just triyng to protect his friends and now they also don't care about N triyng to protect F
Finally a good ending their best friends and I'm crying 😭
Wordless
This is actually good!
f is friends with n
I so happy 🥺
Is this like gonna be a season 2? Or not
1:17 ugly baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo

F > ♡ < N
This video actually shows Z's real character personality.
Ending good

This is so beautiful I cannot stop crying. When Z swirls his tears around it looks like Saturn🤯😇😭f❤n
Say whatttttt
I love it now I'm crying, the story had finally gotten the true ending and n stood up for f 😭. I didn't expect this video to be made. Please if there can be 1 more I will be very happy also will f still be evil?

*Furiously scrolling for the "P Poggers" comment*
Why can’t teachers teach us like this
message for F: F you are the best and you are also good to N
1:54  this part warmed me the most
I thought this story ended on a bad note but I guess they continued it with this nice little end :)
I will make a game version of this
Hhhqhjabahah🧀🧀🧀🧀🧇🧇🥞🍖
Fun fact Z power mack it that he can time travel into the pass
I'm glad that F AND N Live together forever as friends
Mike salcedo your videos are the best
F and N become best friends, the word finish is their word to become a best friend ever!
THEY FUCKING RUINED IT JUST LIKE THE REST,FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Ok this animation is real good but what now number lore?

1:16 f:i raised that boy good
F Died
Thanks for making it right

Wow wow F N the Friends 🖤🧡
Alex

Pls make a season 2 it's great
I wish there was more
how beautiful how wonderful the good ending and the z is no longer sad 🥲😊
''F''
That's not bad.
The Reason Why Z Exploded  Because He Uses His Gems (Left To Middle To Right) It Cause His Gems Move Backwards Faster Than The Speed Of Light K, L, O, B, T And W Has The Same Reaction From The Other Alphabet Lore When F Got Shot by A Laser It Causes Q To Say Kyoo Again Puting N's Eye With "?" With Q's Telekinesis Z Light Speed Gems Became 65 Light Speed Causing Z To Explode Causing Everyone Including Z To React The History It Was Speedy when it first Show Up It Was the Same Thing Where q's Shallowed The "?" It Includes "frick" The Same Thing Happen On The Normal Ending Alphabet Lore Causing f To Fall Over n Thats The Same Thing Happens n Fell Into Somewhere Else It Was W's Nightmare By Himself It Was The Coward And GF In The Alphabet Lore It Causing n The Run Towards f Causing L and O To Hit N And F At There Face Causing N And D Drop a ; And ?  p was kissing g In The Other Alphabet Lore And Now We Finally Could See Lowercase Z
Em mike you can make a halloween for alphabet lore?
Man the fact Z cries enough tears in order to reverse time is very creative
Why like I always do they go over g cause he’s making out with his love
0:35 he's fall😭😂
Now we are waiting for numbers lore and possibly a crossover
🥰❤️
n and f are best friends 😍
Awwww that made me sad but n and f are now together I love this story
so this video is the good ending
Good ending
N: *eats ?* 0:23
❤️❤️❤️🥰
FN💗
This is the perfect way to end the alphabet lore. And your right, it felt... incomplete, like some thing is missing.
Can’t wait for next time won’t you sing with me
🥲
I was thinking. Can you make an alphabet lore without lore and replace lore with kindness?
Baby Z is adorable when he takes a nap 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Aww z is so cute
Baby z at the end was so cute😍😍😍😍😍
next would be the fixed version (next time wont you sing with me)
Oah hay! ay fald saad af f taw
Please make more thay are soooooo 👍 good
😄😄😄💖
Z: Para que o esforço do Quinzinho não seja em vão, vou dar condições para que  o Niltinho conserte as coisas!
This is the true ending of alphabet Lore by the way this video is amazing
Can you make number lore please
3 parte 3 y cómo pasó que se quieran amigo Comando B sapi
Miss opportunity to make Z have a lava texture to it will look like the earth's early look
Much better
you should make a happy future anim
; + ? = &
IN LAST BIT I SAW TINY Z AND IT WAS SO CUTE
baller approved
YES n
fun fact: the thumbnail spells the word "fun"      and a theory:  when Z grew up did that cause a earthquake?
New update
Eu gostei
So this is the last of the alphabet lore?
Q is like =Q 0:23
FRIENDS
So that was how Z looks like in Lowercase
Reason why Z reversed the timeline:Z wanted to reverse time itself because he wanted n to be happy and probably for the future: n and f would probably plan revenge on o and l then every letter would still want revenge on n and f for teaming up.  Edit:just guessing
Wait, this isn’t Arcaea
They're The F and N in FUN
Z and Q did teamwork to let n use his braincells
thats all the good endings!
I think in this case, Z is more of an overseer, pulling the reverse time ability of his right after all went bad. Q only knew about it because... well... he saw the future before.   Really a nice conclusion to it all, where N redeemed himself
NOBODY IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT Z CAN REVERSE TIME
This video should be called "alphabet lore *n* but N uses his braincells" Cuz he didnt thinked about how o, l and f acted some minutes ago
Alphabet lore good ending
Make a season 2 of alphabet lore
So basically Z reversed everything?  (Edit) I thought only F can cry the stones but I'm guessing all of the letters can?
where’s numbers lore
SMALL z
Z:made in heaven
😭sad😭
If the epilouge happened first f wouldn't kill. Anyone
Triste❤️‍🔥
I didn't know that there will be normal ending! :D
(GOOD ENDING)
F did nothing wrong 🥺
Fofo
The z is not the letter its the world :0
people may say N saved everyone, but Z is the true hero of the series…
NnQq
you should make more alphabet lore its way awesome bro
0:34 is it me or did I hear a super smash bros sound?
I FOUND BABY Z 4K
To Mike salcedo can you do a sequel with the Greek alphabet
We need a season 2 the attack of the numbers
like
Z I think represents the viewers because every thing that happened was   Like you can’t do anything about it
Much better I was hoping for something like this but it involves the Greek alphabet but this works too way yo go Z TRUE MVP Right there
Yay happy ending!🎉
im gonna still wait for the next epilougue   "next time wont you sing with me"
There Should Be A Sequel To The Alphabet Lore Called "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me".
no se si algien  sabe Español pero quiero que sigan una 3PARTE.
A good ending!
my crazy theory on how W got there and not in N's dreams along Z, Q and other letters:  Z is a planet that made the A-Y, but there prob other Planet Letters that are last letter of other languages, when F got beaten by C, I, M, L, O, J, T and X, he killed/kidnapped/stole their gems as revenge, Z was always sleeping as the end says, but when that happened, he woke up, prob by the frick, then he saw how the letters couldnt be friends do the fact of L and O, and now, while F was on the V and X part, he beated W, as we can see her with T and B, on the side of Q, he was trying to get his mission completed on all his life, tell the letters about the future and past, as Z cried, tears of ... came out, able to reverse time, Z and Q started to work together as Q tells the letters and makes N eat the ?, as Z sacrifices his ... so everything goes back to where F got beat out and L O, n started to realize what has he done and decided to be beaten by l and o with f as a true friendship, n grated P about something that will happen in the future, and prob we know about lowercase alphabet lore or alphabet lore again, but this time F and N are best friends and they dont kidnap (prob) D. E, R and S
😲😲😲
When n looked down to see the word coward he went to f and ignored his friends but not p that’s so cute n is my favorite letter
Bro this legit made me cry. This ending finally put my heart back together
Good ending 😏
Thumbnail: GOD Q
1:34 didn’t anyone notice that this is a & symbol
Im cried ;-; I like the story só good N and F is back tô be friends
0:08
0:27
0:26
Actual question, which ending is true? this one or the other one? please answer…
Yay happy ending
"Next time won't you sing with me" has a whole new meaning now Who knew they meant, *literally* (I mean this in the context of the alphabet lore)  10/10 ending btw imo, love the happiness
You got the good ending
N really went back in time to save his old friend with the help of z
Z really went Moon night mode going back in time
this was one of the most satisfying endings i've ever seen
THANKS FOR HELPING F THANK YOU SO MUCH :)
Why did L and O Still Bully N. And Why is There Only F R I E N D G P Y Q Z K L O M U T B W C The only letters On Screen. Can We have at least A Little Bit more to Part 2. So That Way All The Letters can be On More. Please
n litterally still f r i e n d s with f though ♾️/10 also this means you kinda have to do another post for the full alphabet lore including this, this was the end. no no not just "the end," *an end*
z to the rescue he found the mastake then he fixed it
Now the memes that say z is us can just watch are over since Z now did the key thing for this wholesome ending
Z was important there and this the good ending
The adult Z: im so lonley wait mike salcedo made my baby son?!?!? Im so happy! The baby z: i dada The adult Z: you said your first word! I so happyyy!!!!!!
Wow, F and N really are buddies. Z was a pretty good player ngl.
WAIT B STILL ALIVE?!😰
Wow Z's a nice guy
Please have a part 3
What was that thing it was so weird maybe it killed them and Q sent N Back in time so he can fix everything
Finally, my heart has been filled ❤❤
letters in lowercase know before this video : a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y ? after : a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
LMNOP
I almost cried
Omg is super cute n en f are really friends l so happy so my name is starting with N so
efs e r
Finally
i can't see y
So cute and Z lowecase
Now that there's a new timeline, what happenes now, or do l and o become a threat
Try to not cry while watching this.
Create the second part idea: the really final
0:09 what this music called?
Now we need to see what happens in alphabet lore when this happened
Spelling lore
Guys there was another F on top of F,s cave BRUH why is there another F there you no what that is a secret to know yo everyone
What I think happened..  So now everyone knows the truth because of the question mark. Including Z, who uses his power to rewrite the timeline so that N is the one who absorbed the question mark (making him see the future). This causes him to stand up for F (since he knows what will happen if nobody does, he becomes evil and beats up the other letters).
the happy ending
And the music in description?
"next time wont you sing with me" should be the credits with extra scenes on the left after the ending
Baby z is cute
Z is a Planet
What if there was a Part 2:Number lore [1 to 30]
Numbers should be the sequel
umm.. sad video? ????
Baby z
I’m glad z went back to the past so they can fix the problem
Is  this f x n ???
yay we all wanted happy ending :D
1:48 'P Was Caught IN 4k.HD'
moral of the story: Never Forget your best FrieNd.
wow
Yea
Salcedo si haces un number lore te damos 200k de likes
Now I know my ABCs  Next time won't you... I forgot 😐
We love L and O We like L and O We want L and O IN HELL.
Awww c: good ending!
Yes
f Oh the French hen  😂😂😂😂😂 😂
And the way p hugged n just like *tiny smack*
So I guess this is an alternate ending where f never turned evil
Part 3 pls
That End Is A Lowercase Z
Pls numeber lore
Alphabet Lore (A-Z...) + Now I Know My ABCs (...Epilogue) | Alphabet Lore = True Ending
I want another part to alphabet lore
This animation was amazing. The ending was beautiful. I accepted the other ending how it was but this blew my mind. Both endings are fine (Pre Z time reverse and Post Z time reverse) but thanks for the happy ending. Sometimes life ends badly, but that doesntean it can fix itself
N looked more hurt than f
F for F
next time won't you sing with me
Why Q make that sound why
I just realized that 26 letters are in the alphabet and he said 28 that means that pt2 is true 👍🏻
t this brang a teer to my heart
yay happy ending!
Guys you all had enough of spam so i reported Calix, at least he learned a lesson.
0:27 ahí están los episodios
we need more!!! We’re loving this
TBH this is really good but I thought somewhere on Someone else’s YouTube channel still this is really good   Also Z be like: UNO REVERSE

Continue alphabet lore pleas😆
Yall were right zets power is changing time
Next video: next time want you sing with me>:)

YouTube kids but 104+ times better:
😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is not happy this is even more sad
wait thanks to that the characters like C, P, J and the other dead letters will still be alive and none will die right?
a
Two words:  Thank you.
The alphabet lore was truly someone amazing and it would make the most sense to continue on with number lore
F N now have a happy life and started a fire arms business in Belgium.
z and n and q are the heros heres how: so z reversed time and q warned them about the future before its to late  and if n did not stay on f's side this would just be the normal ending but n stayed on f's side bc l and o bullied n but f helped n so n stayed on f's side and f was happy that he had a friend so he did not become evil
The p kisses n date wtf
oMG cute
number lore pls
This is sad when F died then Z And then they go back at little kids then n helped f then z came as happy z so he wasn't sad
Z is kinda like a dad with his kids and he just wants them to be happy
Nice the only charecter that dide not have a baby form in the alphabet lore video finally has one
so cute 🥰
Finally the ellipsis do something
This was depressing to watch.
and then the time paths collided the end
I can’t stop cry
0:22 that was actually a bit gross
Z looks so fricking cute when he's young
The good ending
The beginning: AYYYY The finale and endzing (i putted a z cuz it was z that made the good ending)  n sacrifices his adult life for little old good F
F N👍
Mike salcedo u made cool vids about u
Gems that was shown in the whole series are , * ; : ? . ... !

Finally , the Best Ending Ever !
Eso puede estar en el video
Eso nunca lo voy a olvidar hice todo alfabeto yo fui al creador alfabeto el paseo mi amigo que fuera el que creara alfabeto Lorax y qué algunos amigos de mi escuela me estaban diciendo porque no vas a hacer el chapter 2 te dije te lo dije en tu sueño y yo creo que soñaste yo siempre en tus sueños estaba oculto y se te ocurrió chapter 2
I don't think this needed a good ending. But it's nice either way.

Omg new vid
happy ending
Beautyful finish
Seeing Baby f smile is wholesome and adorable   He’s finally happy which is the best thing in the world
Z was the real hero☺️
?????
What i believe Q and Z were doing Q : "Z, help, we need to fix this." Z : "Your right, they never deserved a fate like this, we were not meant to intervene with time, but this once, we do what we must." Q : "Right, ill catch up to N and give him the ?" Z : "I'll rewind time for this, see you." Q : "See you too." AND THUS THE GOOD ENDING
Almost had me crying...
F x N 😱
F
This is like a story where everyone that is not important(Z,Q)and everyone important(O,L)changes roles
FN do you guys know what FN mean?
Its concerning they make lowercase N like that but in reality its n.
Awww so cuteee z f and n
finally  is ends
Q is over powered
Yes i new
Finale? Nonsense! I want more!
Sheeeeeeeees cool animation man
OK
Can’t believe I’m getting emotional over frigin’ “twinkle twinkle little star”
Why did n kill f
but ffff nnnnnnn
no matter their age, z will always have the lowest voice possible
So basically z was all broken and everything because of what f did and killed them and kidnapped them so z actually gets hurt every time a letter gets damaged or something so z decided to return them to the day he started to get hurt because what they are doing and q gives him memory so he can remembers everything so he can know what he was supposed to do then he changed his decision of betraying f and help him instead and z is all good now even if they got damaged a little bit so yeah thats everything you need to know about. Plus hope there is a season 2 or a sequel.
😍
Not only that this was the actual ending of the lore, Z's power is to actually roll back time to when they were still babies. What a happy ending!
good ending but n love f

Yeeeesssssss!!!!!!!!
0:29 p is b?
ßþ:what about us
That was so nice
Z save letters cuz we are using them like now if a letter died it wont be existed anymore like P got shooten by G with out knowing her
Mike really did pull a "But wait, there's more!" on us.  Edit: bruh this reply section is cancer
well thanks for everything, mike. The series lasted a while and became the greatest marvel movie to exist.
This ending was awesome
the duo reminds me of the F&N company
1:13 his smile bro... i keep coming back to this video for this
Someone singing with the title of the video: Next time won’t you sing with me!
WHAT A HAPPY ENDING FOR OUR LOVELY ALPHABET LORE!! NOW THE STORY'S COMPLETE!!!!     PD: i love how cool is lowercase z
Cute Baby Z
lowercase z
😭😭😭😭😭
Lol i thought this was fanmade, but nope its real… also i think this is an alternate universe i guess
HOW COULD YOU 😫 😪 😢 😩 😔
Z is died to 0:10
SO MUCH LOREEEEEE
That was a amazing video😃
now we already know the children's version of the letter Z
*WAIT THEY WERE ROOMATES?*
Hey F U N = FUN
Yeah I was going to ask you that why at the first alphabet Laura video Z was only a grown-up but now he’s a actual baby
[] Uppercase: F Friends N Lowercase: f friends n []
Ff❤
F deserve better
Good ending
This is very sad and nice,epic work.
Real assholes: L and O  M didn't try to beat up F or N P is just doing nothing
amazing a true animated masterpiece
Yes f and n!
f: n? N: f? *hugs eachother*
THIS IS NUMBER #29 ON TRENDING?!
ABCDEFNGHIJKLMOPQRSTUVWXYZ would probably be the alphabet in this world
What about the other letters ? like G, and I still don't understand the reason why other letters hit f in the past, what does "fr*ck" mean ?
2:06 Z Lowercase revealed
OMG F X N
combine the start and the end together
:D good job
wow didnt expect this WOW f was allways good and baby z lol
Thank You For The Continue Lore!!
i just realized Z actually got his powers AT the end of the episode nZ which he cried and got the gem (...) the most powerful out of all of the gems being able to go to the past (or possibly) go to the future
i love ABC
I like when baby g fell
&?
Q and Z is a true hero
Sad
Alphabet but it a good ending:
Tiruwz
I Think “Next Time Want You Sing With Me” Will Make Soon
Kkkkkkkkz💖💖😂😂
Oh
😂😂😂😂😂😂z
at least F and N became friends
Q:THE ELIPSIS IS DISCONTROLLING MY EYES 0:22
Ааааа это ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНОООО
10000000000000000👍
HOW THIS HAPPENTS
1:32 ; & ? dont look right
This describes the video perfectly. “Now I know my ABCs” not only refers to the song but the fact that they recall what happened in their childhood, so now they know the ABCs when they were children. It also refers to the fact N knows what happens in the future and is self-aware.  If someone makes a “next time won’t you sing with me” it should be an episode that’s basically a prompt for the viewers to imagine what happens next by giving more clues but not giving a canon conclusion.
WAIT WHAT ?!
Wow new ending :D
0:22 Q's eyes are exposed
L and O are the evil characters
Why do i feel like theres gonna be a 29th episode beacause W X Y and Z Now i Know my ABCs Next time wont you sing with me Like the last part of the song is missing
Part 2?
Wait doesn't mean f is not going to be evil anymore

Please can you do a part 3
I don't think this is the best ending because the rest of the letters especially R I E D WILL in FRIENDS will still hate F, but it's still a good ending
I sometimes forget the abc...

LaSalle S  #lslslsl Iwjakj was the night
The Fact That F Is Already Dead In Adulthood But He Came Back To Life In The Baby Form
Good Ending.
Jesus Q shaft the question mark is it in Exmouth

YES! IT IS FINISHED! now just number lore
G l o was spawn in nightmare
F DID NOTHING WRONG!
F x N for life lol
I am really glad the story had a happy ending. Now f has friends again. 😊
Ampersand gem :O at 1:30
"Now I know my ABCs. Next time, won't you sing with me?"
Although I agree a happy ending should exist, I find this to be the worst possible way of going about it. This just puts EVEN MORE EMPHASIS on characters that are already emphasized, like n and f. Meanwhile, everyone else is ignored. This is my main gripe with the whole series, really, since X and T and J and can’t forget S literally show up for like 2 scenes in total and then die instantly. It feels like f wins because “oh, he just does” and only loses for the same reason. And then the fans act like this writing is better than every marvel movie combined. So TL:DR,  forced story and too much/too little emphasis on certain characters.
My favorite part is Q making his eyes was shocked or something
I thought lowercase Z has 2 teeth
IM LIKE WAIT Z IS THE ANSWER N IS NO COWARD ANYMORE
Its chapter 2?
Mike salcedo you should make abc lore but is cursive
Poor f
Does billy showed into commute
Number lore
Uppercase Z: I cant take this anymore Lowercase z: this is Better
0:18 "BTW"
bro I love this ending
why is z's voice deeper or the same as Z's? Shouldn't it be higher pitched?
I always think about this and it actually has a video about it and I’m happy
I dont know what this is, but it is amazing
OMG ! Here ! 🎖🏆🔔⚗🛐
wait for example F and N are hurt, it means F and N are bad
idea for Alphabet:the ending  Name:next time wont u sing with me  so,basically they will all grow up into capitalized letters and the other parts depends on you,mike.
DHHHEEEEEEEEE
Can you make number lore please
Next is L and O apologized like they do mistake they bully N and bully F and L and O put F into a frick and make F become evil and L and O they're fault pls do a part 2 okay
Can you do a part 3 And N And F is biger  And F and N Is friends ٩😘۶
omg so epic 0_0
Fn🥺🥺🥺☺️🙂🥲
I really loved this ending btw are we getting number lore?
Its enough to make a grown man cry and that's okay 😢
Nice
Me:Eilips = Ball (But Finale)
Awww😊
Thanks Mike Salcedo! I Finally Able To See Lowercase Z
M is like "oh I f**Ked up"

Mike please if you see this comment  confirm season 2
imagine the next episode is ''next time wont you sing with me''
WHY IS IT SO DAMN EPIC
Next time wont you sing with me...
Please please make the full episode about it it would be the most amazing thing
wow
Who thought there was just a bad ending not everything has bad endings it has good endings too
And then they kissed
I like this song
can mike make an f x n
i kinda want more still (idk why)
The dynamic duo, FN(pronounced F-ing.)
Good ending
I’m going to be honest. There will never be a series like this to ever come on the face of the Internet ever. Unless you did something with numbers. However, I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t be that easy to make a story out of it.  holy…did i just make a speech???
Q did gave N the "?" To let N escape the loop so that N can do the right decision
I've been waiting for the good ending from the start and this was it and i feel bad for f/F now
This is a happy part am crying happy
It’s odd to think about that back in February the Alphabet videos averaged 30k views, and now you’ve hit trending! It’s great to see you’ve come this far.
Z power can reverse??
The character s look simple but the  storyline profound 😔
Wow!
the story ended in the worst way possible, only for it to acctualy not exist. this opens a whole bunch of space for fan creations, like "where is my hat"possibly can be canon now!
2:03
Its nice when n travels back in time and stops F from killing letters.
honestly bro, kinda disappointing. z just reversed everything like it didnt happen and that just through all the struggle out the window. i think it should have ended without an epilogue to leave it to the fans to theorize and stuff which is also what ONE did but still the same great idea always gets used at least twice
20:3
Z look cute 🥰
season 2 lore? or number lore? (i know there's already one unofficial)
magic 2 minutes after subcribing to the channelhttps://youtube.com/channel/UCcBdgF-GBNeR9rkHYDra6Yw
Looking at sky reference
Pov: good ending
&
So 3 blues where time trawl
.............
& 1:33
Happy ending n made it to f
l love F
So uh…. A just got “COPPA’ed”. It is on yt kids.
Yayy
Alphabet lore, now I know my ABCs, next time won't you sing with me 💳💳💳 where is it. Nah but this is good enough I loved it
This dude has gotta be hired for a movie
I thought this was fake
I like Qs eyes when N just got it
I’m still confused what was Z doing there in present day and does the question mark let you change time
Sorry me and asj are the same characters so I love that its finally here
z sounds like a growling dog
make chapter 2 of alphabet lore - everyone likes f but they want to defeat l and o
So cute
Finally… something new.

A Z хорошая концовка
2:03 happy z detected
Sorry of stuff around there
YAAAAAAYYYY
Make up looks like ABC DEFG plushy‘s and if you can’t do that that’s all right I’m not saying that I wanna hate you you will not give it it’s just it’s just a thing ties that you should do I think you should anyways anyone anyone hasn’t subscribed to this you tuber please do and get him is like oh no 10 million subscribers
So what's next (won't you come and sing with me )
bravo Mike, bravo. You have made an incredibly emotional story about the letters of the alphabet, truly a great series i must say, i rate this series as a whole a 100/10
2:20 lowecase of Z
A wholesome Reunion, yet a smoother animation! Also I think Q and Z finnaly knew what to do, like during 0:09, Z make his tears spin backwards, while Q makes N eat the ? So he still knows what happens in the future. That's how this ending occurs! Plus this ending ends in the past, while last time it ends in the future.  Anyways Amazing animation Mike!
The Best Ending On Alphabet Lore Made By :Mike Salcedo
Epilouge Epilouge: next time wont you sing with me
This was a very good story in all really love it!
best ending to this anime we call alphabet lore
Can you do numbers from 1 to 50
What a happy ending!
Finally you make Z not Ugly
The good ending
OOOOAHAHAHAHAHHAAH FFFFFFF HAHAHHAHAHAAHH F F FFFFFFFFFFFF
TOFU
HAPPY ENDING
… fake<> … z power
The perfect ending now we need number lore
I hope he does the number lore soon
The letters F N and Z they are too cute!🥰😍
“Time Travel is a thing”
I'm glad the way you explain that what happens today can cause sadness, loneliness, hate, and fear, but that the experience that remains is to never be a coward and think about how the other feels. And as the n became a friend, but a real friend.
WE GOT THE HAPPY ENDING LETS GOOO YAYYYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It is good end!
Z не усни на всю жизнь а то вдруг апать начнётся бологан
There should be a third one where you see every one after
Z: Zzzzzzz  *turns into fucking saturn*
I love how tiny Z has a speech impediment, hence why he has his tongue between his teet
A really good ending! What we all needed!
Yes someone please show us a show about this like a series about f and n haveing adventure together
A historia agora o N e o F são do mal ? Rsrs
It was soo sad 😭😭
But why L and O mean to N why
E A F
I wish theres a part 2 F and N are Friends Uper Case I Wanna Know
n NOWS (yes that was intentional)
I thought the story was finished and everyone who died is really dead
WHY IS  P SO FAST AT KISSING
The true ending
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
Outcast together
Finally we know what is the power of Z
Does that mean lowercase n is a villain  (just kidding)
F AND N
Best iconic dou f n
Fun fact: the least viewed alphabet lore character short is U and the most popular is A
B
If this is how it began, F wouldn't kill anybody, and i think this would've been such an epic story without murder
could you do when they are uppercase?  see how the alphabet is now
What I believe is that p and n are brother and sister.
*This video actually shows Z's real character personality.*
Okay, that was just flat out awesome. Z saved everyone. My appreciation for Z just went like 📈
J's whole purpose in dying was only to slow down an already slow q. J got robbed of a character arc 😭
New unlock:baby z
N going in smarty mode: 0:40
The K sound tho
I thought lowercase z was hell
This ending is EPIC
😭123...
I always knew Z had something special and there it was. What a masterpiece 😀
friend ending or friend cute ending or happy ending
F and N:D
U should have been on F and N's side, it would been FUN
abcdef gun
Can you maybe put both the videos together?
Q is the stronger character
*This video actually shows Z's real character personality.*
I almost cried watching this😭😭😭😭😭
Now I know my ABCs next time with you sing with me 🎊 🎉
i didnt realize that z was holding the entire white land
Mike can you please show what happend in The future when N changed The past
Will you ever make the alphabet more
The part where you know the real plot
To think of a long journey, you can make anything, do anything. @Mike Salado?  It's so amazing.
A-Z now I know my ABC’s next time won’t you weep with me Epilogue: now I know my ABC’s next time won’t you change the future and live in peace
“The best possible ending”: Shame z didn’t look molten in lowercase like a real planet
Can you do the future of it
This is the best video I have ever seen most videos have sad endings but this one has a good ending
The final is one god ending
This hasme tearing up 🥹
?
What! Are you going to make pt2
I’m crying
Cringe 😬 but a bit good for F for people with eyes on the cominent say F
add number lore
zZ
I like p smack n
When. G knocked over I wheezed
You can’t spell fun without F and N
This is an amazing end to the alphabet lore.🥲🥲
me waiting for “next time sing with me”
...Next time wont you sing with me?
True ending?
G still fall at 1:41
Z IS SO CUTE THO
Looooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
That lowercase Z Is so cute
F and n are nice
Since n swallowed or q gave n the question mark gem he knew the future and went with f side
That face f made at 1:16-
This Is Canon Right?
Lowercase z is back 2:02
Very happy ending And i didnt know Z can go back in time
2:01 are we goin to talk about Lower case Z? 😳
When Z rings spin fast I realize his rings were getting bigger and bigger and my mind exploded and then he turned young
Will it have pt3
f did nothing wrong
Thanks you q and z
Z and Q are 🐐
Omg Good Ending
Good job z good job 😊😊😊
Pov: Z saw everything and Z started to reverse Fun fact: Z's "." "." "." Was actually the time if Z's dots stop spinning the world would stop time
The ending where n has a brain (not offending)
I think z said “Yes. That’s what I like to see. Letters treating other letters the way they are supposed to be treated”
Common q W
Wheres v
I finely can see the ending of lore😭
I love that there's a good ending, it lets all the excitement settle down.
0:36 Poor f
Number lore pls pls pls pls pls
Looks like Z had powers after all
Z Is so GOOD ❣️💘
The fact that Z is the Planet which is so sad
A very good ending
You did good, Zed. Damn good.
It’s not a mistake. It’s a masterpiece.
This is
Finally, proof that young Z wasn't a molten, magma thing. In fact, we even have proof of that ALREADY in the original! In F's evil backstory, we can clearly see that the ground is how it was in the present; a blank white surface. All these incorrect role-play Alphabet Lore games on Roblox say that z was some sort of a lump of magma shaped like a z. My prediction of a blank, smooth, non-cracked young Z was correct!
Q helped to bring to past
Make  number law
NOW WE NEED NUMBER LORE!!! still, if it takes long, we are patient :)
Why Z is a planet? How could letters live?
“N” is a real goat
He finally showed up lowercase z

Why do I imagine a sequel that involves the numbers...
WRHFGTSHJF (9-0)
FUPHHH
I just now realize that Z is a planet
Props to Z  Bro gave up his wisdom to bring back the friendship of F and N   And also gave up his age to be a lowercase again
Happy ending  😮

This is so much nicer
Wait u spelled GA''Y
I like N, Q and Z the best and baby M and N are adorable
LETS GO!!!!! I was waiting for this!!!!
Zzzzzzzz
🥲
I love this part 0:10
Dude you should totally add that to the alphabet lore. I'm going to watch it to see if you did.
Let’s be honest, Z and Q are the TRUE heroes here. If it weren’t for them, F and N would’ve never become friends again.
time travel
Meanwhile Ω: did i harness a literal letter alter the time? *sigh* (silence for 5 seconds) THATS STUPIIIIIIIIIIIII-     *destroys the entire universe*
Z was ...(ellipsis) Z get a .(period) for every catastrophe when he has three he can reverse time.
Now that's a more better ending
Part3 coba lagi @Mike salcedo  Bolen
We finally get to see baby z and what is ... Dose
T.  Nft.
I seemed some bugs is that n should have been hurted since o hirted n.
Plz make the number lore
Did Z travel back time
Now I'm curious for the time where L and O stopped bullying
0:24 THE EYES FROM Q I JUST FREAKED OUT BY SCARING MYSELF
If you pay attention, you can see that f's ; and n's ? combine and make &
Me en canto el final de f y n🤩❤❤
Oh my god I was really waiting that  Hey and um why don't you do another thing of alphabet lore but it's the future like now that N and F are in the cave I kinda want to see what will happen  Thx for this series I love it so much ❤
Did anyone else notice that p gave n a little kiss?
&
0:40 0:41 0:42
Are we going to have a alphabet lore aftermath?
Z hit puberty before he was born
It’s the true ending, finally
I thought it was fanmade from the thumbnail
Good Ending😇
Z is happy at the ending
I haven't even realized how deep Z's voice sounded like
So sad
MWA! BEAUTIFUL!
there must be one more there's still more of the ABCs of course I'm talking about the "Next time won't you sing with me"
Z´s Powers 0:12
So AMAZING
I needed the this ending
You Will  be very famous with that animation
What a nice  ending , a question  that follows?
I’ve watch this so much times!
The incident has been reversed. The deceased letters have been resurrected. (except for H, but nobody could've done anything to save him, really.) F and N are friends again. Q's voice was finally heard. And everything is lovely once again. Wonderful.
Z’s Health bar was pupule
i thought this was fan made
Alphabet season 2 pls
YAAAAAAAAAAAY
fn=fortnite
That ending was Awesome
GAY XD
is anyone gonna talk about how at 1:41 P is making the pog face
I was heartbroken after I found out what happened to F and N so watching this makes me wanna cry
i think n was chosen by q because n was the last one chosen by of that made this chaos happen and they can reconcile with of by writing friends
Their needs to be an alphabet lore of this where the good ending (best ending) took place
Lowercase Z
Why a z lowercase
I love that N made a good choose this time for F thanks Z also Z as a baby is so cute.
We need a “next time won’t you sing with me” now
Wait, does that mean the letters know Z exist?
The fact the last frames is black is so perfect, meaning that the loop they’re stuck in is finally over…
Also can you make this an entire series? It's actually really cool. 😊
#18 ON TRENDING
Juanita
I would like to see to see alphabet lore after this one
in the first one it was sad that Z couldn't anything about F but now he came up with a plan to save everyone.
So is everyone alive now
0:06 this is probably a coincidence but did anyone else noticed that they spelt out “run”
FriendsolfnGloz
1:16 (WARNING PAUSE BEFORE CLICKING 1:16) if we put a in between m and o its lmao😂
friends
give z the nobel peace prize
01:20 aw
02:20 baby z awwww
Baby z awwwwww💖💖💖💖
The good ending
Elipsis is a power but in alphabet lore I thought it was a moon
Ok I gotta say I loved this ending it almost made me cry, but I NEED SOMEONE TO TEACH A LESSON TO L AND O >:V
Yesss a final :)😁
Looks like f has been brought back to life from the afterlife and it looks like he went back to his past and changed it
zeeeeeend
Toute le lettré de l'alphabet
as long as O and L supper I'm happy  FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF FFF FFF FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF FFF
My guess as to what's happened here is that Z managed to get his Punctuation Gem through careful recreation of the Period Gem. This made it much more powerful than the normal Punctuation Gems, rewriting history. However, the Punctuation Gems were created by F, including the Question Mark Gem. This is basically F asking N "Why?" So, N receiving the  Question Mark Gem is N realizing what he had done wrong. With this happening at the same time as Z's Artificial Punctuation Gem rewriting time, causes the rewriting of history to be influenced. This sort of carries over N's realization into lowercase N, causing him to reject L, M, and O, and ally with F. This is my interpretation of what this Epilogue means.
Mike is a great creator. What if he created a sequel!?
🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Z:zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Z saved everyone, Yes, with no death
Xd
It’s 6am and I’m watching this
i was wondering how lowercase Z looked like
Z is the old letter. And that old letter just saved the world and became a kid again. Yes, the only letter we finally saw in that look.
So n was really not a coward!
Small z sound is no different with Z
am i the only one that saw N’s eye say Frick?
So what happens in the future
N looked cute when N hugged P, it makes me comfortable
Achievement Unlocked: Saviour Aquire the True Ending
This absolutely ruined the Shakespeare like action story of the alphabet lore. Truly bad.     P.S The animation I believe has more frames but it still ruined the amazing storyline of the alphabet lore.
Season 2 season 2
i saw this in a video and i thought it was fanmade
Es final canon o no
Last time I seen me part 2
happy ending yoyyel cake!
We though the lore ended,but here, we saw lowercase z
fn

Hasta perro3. Lis
LOWERCASE Z IT'S SO ADORABLE OMGGGGG
It's so amazing. I'm glad that there is actually a happy ending to this

To Mike Salecdo  at 2:02 you will actually see The final Letter in Lowercase but has uppercase voice 😢 And This the Saddest Alphabet lore video ever 😭
a
coward???
This is the ending that everyone has been waiting for. And this video shows what Z's Ablity's are. If Q Didn't Give The Question Mark Before In Time Maybe N Would Of Betrayed F again. The Real Hereos In This Story Are : Z, P , And Q. Peak Story. 20/20.
Dang bro these animations are legit godlike
speechless
Q: Stretchs Eyes Me: KYOOOO GANG
So cute that n is such a good friend and is fine with just living with his bestie.
Q showd the pass to N and N fix it
Mike salcedo please make another alphabet lore where f and n are grown up and happy and other letters are happy and f doesn’t kill letters he tells them to spell FREINDS
Osa chiut
So cute of N😢
Who would've thought we will get a Happy ending.
WE ALL NEEDED THE ENDING!
In the bad ending Z gets sad in the happy ending Z gets happy!
I mean z
I wonder if we're going to see more of it, or Number Lore?
I really did
I was actually thinking you would make a part two about how they felt bad
Part 3
Z be like:no this cannot end like this
And Z is happy
F IS GOOD NOW YAYYyYy
That really works out N stood up for F in the end
Lowercase (New) z
0:21-0:25 is the coolest scene, well in my ipinion
the end of movies be like:
NOW I DONT KNOW MY ABC’S
I've watched the normal alphabet lore and it was SAD but this one was better at the normal one I cried because F had no friends and Z was sad just sad😢😢😢😭😭😭
1:50 😶
N ate the ? Gem to turn everyone back to babies
Quiero más episodios de alfabeto Lore
what a happy ending! 🥲
Is missing 'Next time won't you sing with me?' Cause any chapters' name belongs to the alphabet song.  I suggest this new chapter should be of this alternative universe when they are capital letters now that F is not bad
O and L is the bad but F is the bad of a history bad says.
Wow
this is better than the HOLLYWOOD Mario movie back in the 90’s
We now got lowercase Z now and he’s cute in lowercase.
QUAHH
happy Z
❤❤❤
I wonder when “Next time won’t you sing with me” is gonna come out 😂
YES!!!!!!

This doesn’t feel like the end                 I don’t know why
Awww I’m happy for f and n and p because p is begging nice with n
Z made N chance the past so instead N helps F and it's a happy ending all because of Z. great second animation
So... 3milions Views?!
All the kidnapped letters and F spell FRIEDS because F wasn’t able to capture N
COOL MAN

I just realized that the ? And ; at 1:32 join for a split second to make &, symbolizing how F and N are truly best friends and will always be together.

I hope there would be a chapter 2... But sadly it's the finale.

I've watched this about 5 times, and I just noticed, when n stood up for f, f didn't say "f?" But instead he said "n?", as if he was surprised n cared for him. Great ending.

Bruh im sad 😭😭
Do this episode of this is the best
finally Z did something to save the letters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLp9OQBnfdA This video is the exact same
BY THE WAY Z ALSO GIT YOUNGER
COMMON Z IS BACK!!!!
between 3 and 5 years old I always thought that one day I would show a story made with letters from the alphabet, nowadays I am 10 years old and there appears an animation that I always dreamed of existing since I was 3 years old, it is a good animation!!!!!!
I'm not crying, you're crying!
omg
and the main villains l and o go unpunished
For those who did not understand anything here It is:  When Q gave the question Mark(?) To N,everyone Saw what happened in the past that made F become evil.so then they look at F body thinking About what they did,so Z uses his elipses(...) To Go back in time,só desperaly Q trows the ? To N and hopes he remember what Just happened,so everyone goes to the past but nobody has Memories of what happened just N.so he realizes his mistake and supports f istead of hiding in l,m and o.so l punchs f and o punchs n and they are happy because they are friends,and they cry ; and ?,and a little before they Go to f and n again they form a &.so they start going to the cave,and they see p and g so n tries to cry the exclamation point(!) To p,because in the old timeline She was the only that supported him when he Lost his gem (;).so they Go to the cave and we see for the First time,lowercase z,he is happy because in the old timeline all he wanted was all letters to be friends so the end.(btw i think Theres gonna be a last part for this called "next time won't you Sing with me" (edit: did n Just peed on the floor in 0:54?)
The series that looks ordinary to the eyes due to the story involving only alphabets, but surprisingly has the most exceptional meaning out of any series and the most heartwarming ending that the world needed.
2:03 z
:O
Did anyone notice the at the end z doesn't have the ...  here's my theory When z has ... that means the end of f & n's friendship ends When z dosen't have ... that means f & n's friendship hasn't ended
5/5
N was my favorite he was in the gold place but now he is in DIMOND!!!!!!!!😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
2:04 What’s in Z’s mouth?
Can you do a series when their born to old ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSTUVWXYZ q look too old for being old already RIP Q???
Happy end
Can you make a number lore
I think baby z has a lisp 2:02
I actually thought that F should have been with L, M, N, O, P, and X because of the ? gem but this is better ;v;
people who thought that there would be no happy ending before this   👇
Yeeees this is the ending we all needed
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I am Z cause my name starts with Z aka Zachary
wait, did F always have chains in his cave? If yes, then was F always evil..?
Woah, I just took a break for 4 hours and the subs went from 500K to 505K
Finally I won’t have to feel bad for F anymore
happy ending
Thanks you for help F

Awwwwwwww baby Z is so cute
I know you're the creator of alphabet Lord too can you make another alphabet Lord one but with f is nice cuz this happened cuz and actually saved him because I think the only reason that he is mad is because of the building if someone stood up to ask I think you would have been nice in the future can you make another video of alphabet Lord but f is nice cuz n stood up for him.
Good much good 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😊👏👏
ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQRXTUVWXY AND Z

1:52-8
I love when p kiss n😊
Atleast there no end of the other lore of it bad
This is Canon now
Make part 2
some more episodes please🙏
cowad
part 3 please
Steven Spielberg? Nah Mike Salcedo
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Wow, this animation was great
He stopped the plot!!!!!
When the time with the Z’s Moons/or tears were going at a speed to turn back time to make things right, Q saw this coming and right before the time and universe got reset back to when they were little/lowercase Q gave the Question Mark holding the future and truth of what will happen, therefore N was able to see the future and make things right by realizing that F isn’t the bad guy and giving him a friend so therefor F would have a happily ever after and not become the evil or possessive F that he was during the bad ending when he was lonely. Z had 3 tears seeing as he had seen things like this happen 2 times before the current events so he obviously had mastered how to turn back time. This is my theory.
Now I want part 3 to be an Alphablocks collaboration (Its made by CBeeBies and I'm gonna tweet them about this series)
So n has a p mother
nice i want this ending
l m n o
🤯
The good ending
lmo

Good job, people are gonna start shipping N and F now😅😅❤❤
…wow
F and N sitting in in the cave K i S S  N G. first comes love second comes Married
Why don’t they all be together F did nothing wrong
This is better then marvel and DC combined
More like a dlc
Fn=fin=the end
THE LOWERCASE Z IS ADORABLE!
Wait Z just stands there until this
:)
Who else saw that once they were zooming out, F was still alive on top of the cave. bro actually used the clone gem (I don’t know what it was called) to make a clone to fake his death
1:32 It's the &
@Mike Salcedo    You should really make a one hour movie on alphabet lore that is based off of the ending of this, where F and N become friends again. So how it’s gonna work is because F is the villain, and F and N became friends again, I want you to make it to where N is helping F get rid of the rest of the alphabet. I mean, it makes sense!
WOW!
Suck O and L
BRO THE LOWERCASE Z
althabet 2
POV: It’s 2025
YES!!!!
"Next time won’t you sing with me…?" would hit different asf
Good ending also l and O is bad because one more l is lol
Good ending
YIPPEE
Z is a baby letter too!?
Good ending:f didnt turn into demon
W O W😮👏
BEST. ENDING. EVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.
The good ending!!!
This made me cry.  Also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThyxCiqwlxw&t=24s for Mike Salcedo Your video is TO good
1:33 &
I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying 🥲

Baby z 😍👶
awehhhh thank you for this, it’s such a nice ending! ; v ;

1:32 &
N’S REDEMPTION ARC
The best ending
Lmo
Baby z at the end
Espero que salga temporada 2 si sale debepente hay universos de las letras como numeros o como letras de otros paises como que abra un nuevo villano de otros universos como le paso a f
NOBODY CARES, I HOPE DISNEY BUYS YOU THEN DELETES THE SERIES!!!
Plot twist: N & F is in a date while im in a fate     I think im abusive Im sorry
Good video!!!!!!!
😂😂🤣🤣
win this level lowercase f
Ummmmm… I think we need what happened after this 🙃. And please number lore next!
wait where was V in the beginning? didn't he make up the van?
Now all we need is to see F.N take on L.O because their the real villains and bullies in fact bullies tend to get what they deserve so i wanna see an epic showdown with F.N and L.O
I swear if I see a comment saying “OmG f Is PiBbIfIeD” then    eyf
*Alphabet Lore: The Sequel*
Next time won't you sing with me: Φ: PHI!! Φ: finds metal* Phi! (Gonna make hand-powered recovery center) Φ:Builds HPRC* Recovers F* F: F (Thanks) F and Φ: Kills B and A* Note: Φ will have the same face as F and Color Black
No all we need is “next time won’t you sing with me”
1 2
Sad ending + happy ending?
This is what should have happened in the lore itself 😭❤️
Nooooooooooooo This can be the end
Z used his power to go back with N to make F friendly and happy again
Looks like Z power is control the time
Z is the really hero
The thing we’ve been all waiting for, LOWERCASE Z!
I had a feeling a video like this would come out
0:16
Finally the good ending
Season 2?
Is there a "Next time come and sing with me" coming? 👀
Good ending 🥲
OMG SOMEBODY GIVE ME THE TISSUE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I see the word btw
Just amazing
BABY Z LOOKS SO CUTEEEEE I CANT STOP CRYING 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 THIS IS SO MELT HEARTING AND THE ENDING!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 AND THE BABYSSSSS!!!!!! YOU ARE MAKING ME CRY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!😭😭😭😭
The Good Ending.
Good job for making this part mike!
Man turned the alphabet into a masterpiece
Ok so did Z go back in time to stop F from being bad?
The best end
Im sobbing this is perfect
I love this from the start already dayumm the ending everybody needed
Ok I have a question though. If Q could tell the future then why didn't he do anything?
1:48 Mom kiss
I pronounce you the most best animator of all time mike salad
That is so good  and cool!
Lowercase L looks like a Karen
F’S SMILE ITS SO CUTE😭😭😭😭
HUH??
How the hell  did F get sharp teeth in. the beginning he had normal teeth now he has sharp teeth
number lore when
number's lore NOW
Is love
The part where Z is doing something kinda reminds me of the ending of the world
1:32 &
F IS HAPPY :-D
Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz now I know my abc
Pee
Q is psychic
great ending indeed
Good Endings
me encatan  estos videos
Now all we need is a next time won’t you sing with me
Aaaaa!
Eso ase un amigo
First pin oh yea Mike Mike Mike Alphabet lore
THIS IS PERFECT
F❤N
Hot take: the og ending is better
2:12 the end
we all needed the true ending
yo but Z he just rewinded time like it was nothing
Next time won't you sing with me..
FINALLY LOWERCASE Z
The heroic music at 1:13 was a perfect fit for the occasion
Did they win they're going to talk about the fact that Q flexed his eyes and pointed them at N shooting the ? at N's mouth 0:22
As Z restarted it Q gave N The question mark Before it changed. Question mark Ability: Seeing Past Or Future Z Used the alphabet for Entertainment as he was Breaking down He made A story Out of it.
Now we need number lore or next time won’t you sing with me
so z happy 2:01
Probably one of the best things I’ve seen in my life * intense clapping*
OMG IT'S LOWERCASE z
To be honest F do not kill ppl for no reason and spell out friends make friends with your kindness but you have none.
N technically isn’t the hero since Z got us the happy ending. Also G is the real villain since if he didn’t try chase F just because he knocked him then we would’ve gotten a happy ending
:(
Make the worst ending pls
the hole in my heart has been filled
f❤️n
Bruh😂
So this is all happy ending i tho ( alphabet lore : the series ) was a sad ending that F die
KYOO
Now we need Alphabet Lore-Egyptian Edition
Z is so cute I wanna tickle him!
Finally we get to see Z’s true young form. And yet Z did more than we seen.
Z WTH
Is very good of good end =D
Thats enough to make a man cry :)
(lo que van a leer tendrán que traducirlo) Yo me esperaba un final bueno para esta serie del alfabeto y aquí tiene más esfuerzo esta saga sobre todo esta parte 0:22 la parte más esforzada
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤F
Omg best eindig ever I hope we get a part 2🥺🥺🥺
We needed this ending

This is so cool oh my God

This is what I waiting for
LESSS GOOOO, THE GOOD ENDING!!!
😊😊😊
Is smash
Yess good ending 😭
Z still speaks the same

I realized that z has a gem too the suspensive points ... Because all the gems come out of the tears of the letters
... gem: Can alter time
No more f dezth
Happy z
WOW I- I have no words…
The friendship of Fn is always on your keyboard :D
Now it's the alphabet lore season 3 season 4 coming soon

This is so sad it made me cry it is so heart warming 😢
The true ending :,)
Please alphabet Lore season 2 please
We finally got the true ending to the Alphabet Lore
Alphabet lore error noticed!! When we zoom out from everyone mourning the loss of F, we see F.. alive at the top of the cave. just wanted to let you notice that
I can't wait to continue
More emotionally investing than the current MCU
POV: you thought this was made by another person
1:33: &
Thank z for giving n a chance to fix this once and for all
The ending was great. I was expecting that to be it, but not only did you add more, you gave a better ending.
Make the number lore (1-26)
Y is Crying
Why dose e look like he happy about that
If this gets like a chapter 2, i can imagine F, N, and P are gonna be the new protectors while L and O become the new main villians
We finally get to see what z looks like when he was younge
2:03 ok ok that's cute. Whatever, LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW CUTE IT'S Z CHILDREN
This guy is a legend
Good Endibg Is All We Need
It was so emotional this ending, i want so much to see theres 27 episodul more but will wait together in 28 octomber
Next time won't you sing with me. The last last ending.
in the lowercase l and o are the bully
"Stop making me cry. Its too much to deserve"
😊 that was so good!
Not that the animation used to be bad, but the animation has improved so much since nZ. Props to you.
Secret ending unlocked
zZ
petition for there to be an episode called “Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me”
Well now we all know Z can do bites the dust aka reversing time
Wait H is still dead wtf

Lowercase Z moment
Z is Powerful and good small z 😢😢
Hurray 😍😍😍😍
It’s like one of those videos that someone creates something stupid and suddenly it becomes so popular and becomes a meme
1:31 &??
Fun Fact: This Was Launched In My Birthday
How is B alive?
Lowercase Z is here!
It was nice to know that Z ended up saving their timelines and reseted himself to a lowercase formation   Bro gave up his wisdom just to bring back the friendship of F and N  And he gave up his own age just to be a lowercase again  Edit:Thx for 76 likes
What an amazing ending to an amazing series. Can't wait for more, keep up the good work!

Z's Fate
THIS IS SO CUTEEEEEEEE
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is the ending i wanted and i liked that Z is some kind of god, tbh without Q and Z is would be a sad ending
good ending :>
SAME BUT THERE......
HOLY MOLY ITS THE ENDING WE ASKED FOR
if Z is the planet they are on, what happens if E, R and O stack on top of each other to create zero?
Ñ please

when Z did that thing and when n talks it was so cuteee😍i hope f is happy with n last video n didn't help he's friend

I cried  a lot because of the N and the F...                                    ;)
the good ending
BEST FRIENDS FOR EVER :)
Moral of the story: Never be afraid to do something good even your friends say don't. I think...
This is right after the end of alphabet lore the original video. Also the animation is way better than the original, and I watched mike’s other videos too and their amazing. I hope you make more animations
Is P N’s mom
N deserves respect no pity no poetry no disrespect
Where’s v
Z it's te world?
This is what we needed
How this is happen?
bro that's what happend if f got a new friend
Your alphabet lore is better than my russian alphabet lore
Its cute ;)
Oh my god I never was that happy about an ending
this was the best ending i've seen
YES
Alternate universe where n stand up for f
Wooo part 2
We finally got a good ending: f and n became best friends in the future f finally had a friend
There could be one more episode. After all, the Alphabet does go "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K L M N O P, Q, R S, T U, V, W, X, Y and Z. Now I know my ABCs, *NEXT TIME WON'T YOU SING WITH ME?"*
Sad story 😥, with happy ending 🥲
; + ? = &
So what happened to F's eyes?
LOWERCASE z
Fact: that the letters when they are really old they turn into lowercase
Well i know now Z is the most powerfulest letter
F
How did thay grow up?
Now all we need is next time won't you sing with me
Some fucking idiot stole this and said it was "tHe GoOd EnDiNg" and said they edited it to make it the good ending. All of the comments are like "Omg this is so good!" and every time I tell them it's stolen they're like "LoOk aT tHe DeScRiPtIoN". I'm literally facepalming so hard right now.
1:08 Whoever thought Lowercase B had a hole,look at this image
GOD!!! SO CUTE!!!
Werher's  Ñ
Isnt Z Was Ededd Power???
#fdidnotdoanything Right guys?
Another sequel of prequel would be: next time will you sing with me
Does anybody want to know what q and z did well I can tell you z reset time and before he reset time q put the ? in N so that he can know the future
I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENDS AFTER THIS. WILL F BE GOOD?
0:24 Did Q just give the gem that was stuck in his mouth for years into N’s mouth?
I think N went back to the Past to help F to get some friends and then in the Future F will be normal like the other Letters.
0:12 Wait is Z the whole planet where everything happend?
I do kinda like to see an Aftermath of them as adults.
0:10 F’s alive?!
yessss!!!!!!!!!!!! A good ending
Is this part 2?
Z went baby mode 💀💀
im gonna cry becase n is friend with f now in crying!

Just here to say this, M is underrated

&&&&&&&
Я конечно всё понимаю но на первой части алфавита Лора на трансформации буквы Л обязательно было показывать ж***
Making The Word A Universality Z
😀 this is  good ending de n he protec f
brooo
PLEASE!!!!! I really wanna see more with alphabet lore! Do F and N growing up inside the cave and L and O hating on them or something. Both videos are the best animations that I’ve ever seen and I really wanna see more!!!!
Better than marvel movies man!!1!1!
F is still not socially accepted to society but at least he has a friend
Plot twist: the f that died was fake at 0:10 the real F is at the mountain
I don’t know why but my favorite part is when Q throws the ? in to N to mouth
alphabet lore final!??
What is k gender
Man f did nothing wrong l and o are the worst aka the villain(s)
THIS IS HOLY
Z has a deep voice even tho he is a kid made me laugh 😂
YESSS FINALLY WE HAVE YOUNG Z z
*cthis
A is for AAAAAAA B is for bop C is for sthis is wholesome
Thank you for all the Good intentions and the lowercase z! And for all the chapters from A- the Epilogue Of the alphabet lore Remembering by Rewinding the Universe To understand, Everything.
Best ending ever add this part to the full alphabet lore.
Z,Q and N are My favorite characters  Z: it feels like a giant worried about the people living in his head  Q:He was so fucking worried to Chase his whole life the rest of the Alphabet yo warn him about the future consecuences And looks like he have Powers too,telequinesis and seeing the future with the "?" Gem  N: I LOVE THE LOWERCASE N DESING,SO CUTE
😢 Perfect nZ…
Good ending :) and i crying 😭
Me: I almost got caught that is almost got “GAY” between N and its like “GANY” who is called “GAY” lol :’’’’’
Stop at 0:14 and now z its "Zaturn"
A happy ending for me!😊
I actually thought this was a fake because f walks like hes sad when n and f walk to the cave
Anyone else notice how only F, P, and N got their crystals, but the others didn’t?
The true ending 🥹
А што дальше
0:00 emotion damege
Then where did q get the ? badge
Plis make F tranform
1:41 pog p
lemme guess, this episode may come out or not "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me?" (i don't ask mike salcedo to make that episode, but he may or may not do that)
Some things I realised is that when P helped N, it was NP (No Problem). And also Lowercase L’s chin is shaped like a lowercase L. F’s design is the only design that shakes, because he is a black goo best shown in Y (episode).
😍😍😍
*(claps)*
Ооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооо это круто
Next vid next time come learn with me
1:17 cute f

Next number lore 1-10
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
YES! WE UNLOCKED THE GOOD ENDING!

Next is "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me"

I- I LOVE IT, IT MADE ME CRY 🥹
They’ll hate them but at least they will be friends forever
z? Ou Z?
its is sad😭😭😭
Question:Did N and F grow up together or smth?
This is real ending
F HAS ; N HAS ? M, L. O: P!  X HAS *
1:26 The sound Of lowercase N was so cute it made me cry😊😭
Next idea: make another part what happened after this episode pls if u can
i get it f and n is like Fn its a key
We need a number lore now!!!!!😢
1:56 so cute
😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ N and f are together
WE FINALLY GET TO SEE z

It’s so beautiful🥲
Season 2?
Finally. Good ending
Baby Z!
I want know how Z got the gems?
😭😭😭😭😭 Esse foi meio triste da minha vida💝
I actually cried on this one, Thanks mike
I’d imagine that if this was continued to the point where they’re adults, the alphabet would go as normal the whole way through without any interference from F (and F would just say “F” when he appears on-screen, and then never appear on-screen again)
If we gat an official number lore it would get 1# trending. Edit: THAT WAS A JOKE WHAT
THIS IS ADORABLE DQDWFSXLWKDWKDJNJQEKQKDKDKDKWD
where did V go that time after he is afraid of going inside of the cave?
A good ending
Justice for F
Wow f

Ok but when’s number lore
FINALLY THE ENDING!!!! YISSS
I'm gonna be honest, we didnt need this ending. The animation style is totally different than what were used to and it feels off-putting. I honestly would have been happier without the ending.
This dude deserves a medal
I can tell this takes a very long time and I’m proud. At first I thought alphabet lore was just dumb letters doing things, but now i love watching this and alphabet lore. I’m very happy to see this
The true ending yay3x
diganme porfaaaa

When i see fn: Fortnite
This IS literally the most happy ending i see in MY entre life!

Good Ending 😃
we dont need anime ending now XD
I Love this ending plz jake more keep,up the good work mike
Can I just ask how old this stupid alphabet lore shit has been more entertaining than any Marvel movie I’ve watched? It’s literally a fictional video about the English lexicon.
Aquí siempre las malas historia fueron O y l
The ending is sad and happy at the same time
I wish this was the actual ending of alphabet lore
Z is a baby now
Z is the god alphabet
I almost cried, it was emotional for me.
finnaly good ending
This is definitely the most wholesome ending I've ever seen.
We thought the lore ended sadly,But finally Z uses his power to save everyone,in the past n walks away from l,m and o and helping f,now they are friends :D
planet Z LOL
Dear Mike salcedo For the video Now I know my ABC's can we as in your fans get a new alfpet lore for the video of now I know my ABC's pls😊
I'm crying
Cute Z
Aww baby z
My name was Dawson, but after watching Alphabet Lore I changed it to Dawsfn.
0:31 wth X?!?!!
FINALY BABY Z
WAIT- THIS IS OFFICIAL?!
0:30 pause it E!
This Is so wonderful it made me cry
we didnt asked for this ending, but we needed it. Imagine if they made a "Next time wont you sing with me?" where when they grow up everyone is in peace. i wonder what F looks like when he grew upand became good
0:41
I know little bit there you know (Z said: lets re-start life again)
if the ending was r i e d s went with f & n that would be the great ending
Is a Happy Ending
I ship it
F IS BACK F F F F F F F F
If you dont know whats happening, Z is like time, the tears is hours, seconds, days and so on, Z decidides to reverse time: the tears are reverseing: but befour he reverses time, q manages to give  N rememberance. ? is rememberance, so when  the time is reversed, N now knows evrything instead of q, and since n is faster than q, he can make a diffrence, instead of the sad ending we now know, we finnaly get a bittersweet ending. also Z is now useless, other than the structure of that planet
Cool true good end
The best ending ever :)
Lowercase Z
I can finally know z is not lava as a planet. Thank god
Now this is VERY VERY heartwarming.
please L atk
we've seen the alphabet lore, put what's next? Number lore? Just adventures with these guys? Is he just gonna go back to explosm? Who knows? But this was seriously an incredible series, and will never be forgotten.
Baby z baby z baby z
I have a theory that, N was comfortable having P around maybe bc P reminded of F or idk.
Nice we found Baby z
This guy turned the abcs’s into a whole goddamn movie
Thank you Z
Bravo for hitting 500k subs Be sure to still hit 1mil Subscribers!
The true timeline is the one where n has the question mark from the beginning.
This is the good ending
Wow,I feel leather.
The next one he should make should be called next time won't you sing with me
F just wanted some friends because he chained up r I e d s and ultra form N killed f next to r and N was in the middle of e and d so F just wanted some friends
N it's much sweet and breathe. In the the real alphabet lore real N she is a coward Now this is a happy ending (≡^∇^≡).
Very lovely 🥲
KYOOOOO gave n the Future
Something about this is... Offputting... Oh it's the fact that the thumbnail is full screen.
Man that was soooo....... dramatic
F and N are good friend
In the first scenes g, a and y spels gay When z is reversing time there is b, t and w spelling btw
Original: Bad ending  New: good ending
Ну... теперь это лучше чем арбуз.
i didnt khow that z was a cery big guy ( like a sky island )
Fiannly weget to see lowercase z now

F AND N FOREVER
Congrats for 500k subs

WOW the ending is sooo nice that N was with F
this made my day thank you
Now that the past as changed, the future will probaly be different
Z is so cute on smell z😍🥰😍
The True Ending.
GG on 500k!!!
Absolutely sadisfiying
Hey baby Z
Q wanted to save N from the Z explosion before it was to late  Q;s finale words: goodbye my friend  N
I don't care what other are saying but now I need to see F and N kiss 😘 😏
Man I LOVE THIS ENDING
Lowercase  z
That will be sad and the end
This Animation Is Cooler Than The First And Cute And A Bit Sadder, But Now You Added How Ellipsis Works And Lowercase Of Z
We will never get the episode Z?
Is this what we call gay
The good anding
🎉 the ending is here!!!!
make more alphabet lore  videos
litteraly the best ending
Z got them powers
do we just ignore how L just said "L" to N?
this is so random
In reality you made 27 ep so why dint make another one to see how they will do in the future
Bro Q knew what was going to happen so him n and z were the only ones who knew what was going on like that they were back in time
I love that p just kisses everyone
now the story changed. how will the F and N act in different timeline? still be friends with other alphabet or go psycho like F was in first timeline
This is literally beautiful
Planet the god of alphabet lore so the end
Z has cried 3 times then because when he cried he  cried a . And probably has cried from l and o hitting n and when f got angry and at the ending of the alphabet lore
Happy ending :O
Baby z
i saw the word BTW
THE LOWERCASED Z THE LOWERCASED Z IS REAL!!!
Is cuteeeee
YOOO WHAT I SAY  HES 16 ON TRENDING
This is the best ending ever!!!
This ending is so cute I’m gonna dieeeeee!!!!!!!
This is confusing. Like, would N be evil or F be good? Are there 2 Question Mark gems since N had the knowledge from it before it existed? Was only N sent back with the knowledge he had? If everyone was sent back with the knowledge they have, what about dead characters? Were they just revived because younger,or were they sent back with the knowledge they had before they died? And, if this happened, the original lore wouldn’t have happened but it did but also didn’t? I NEED ANSWERS
Make number in 1 to 26. And 6 is bad soooo make number
Bro n didnt give m his stone rip m
Happier ending: they lived the life alive
Good thing u didnt forget Z  this is better than the real one
Aeee final feliz
n and f are friends forever, The End.
I wish they made a second  lore like number lore vs alphabet lore
1:50 Damn, G got no "G"itches.
😊😃 I am team😃
z lowercase bro
This is when z in 5
Mike in a week made a better show than Netflix in year
Guys I think marvel copied this guy
I love this so much, I literally cried
Wow N did something for me... For N.... -From small f
The fact this is the actual lore
Hopefully There no F x N ship
This ending is the best we needed it baby z was so cute!
This is cool 😭
Z is the real hero here
The good ending.Thanks Z and Q
Q And Z Saved The Day 😭
🥰🥰
The ending we all needed
Thank you so much too Maegan but I was super happy to get a happy ending the first time I saw
explode 3 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭
Be Z blue fkn svy Eligible F sad
F N=BEST FOREVER BEST FRIENDS
Fun fact, lower case f, upside down lowercase n and n spells fun so it makes sense that they are friends and also p can stand for parents so it's possible p and g are the parents of n and the fact that p and g are close together spells out pg, what a nice joke even p and g aren't pg, hehe get it
Noice
We finally found the lowercase of z
aaaaaaaaaa#abbbbbcccccdd😂🥲🤕
Lower case Z is so cute when he smiled
This is only an alternate ending because this is in a different reality where f doesn’t turn evil and it’s happy but we all know that the original ending still happend
Put even more happier endings to this! That he goes back in time again AND CALMS DOWN EVERY LETTER AND THEN IT WILL BE GREAT!
When a lore is better than a  movie be like:
This is real friend ゜:(つᴗ⊂):゜。
👍👍👍
Can you make number lore plssssss
End To End-Alphabet lore commonscence #Alphabetlorecommonscence User now.
F and N live happiness ever after The End love from Canada to you and the YouTuber have a wonderful awesome cool day my friend
After they have seen the past, they felt like they needed to do something. Z took matters into his own hands, and decided to reverse time itself. Before it is too late, Q gives N the ? symbol, so he remembers what happened. Time reverses. We see n. f flies right over n and falls, crumpled both physically and emotionally. l, m, and o land beside n. Then, n realizes. He looks at o and l, remembering the bullying. Then he looks at f, remembering his good deed. n sees his own reflection in the black liquid. In one eye, he sees the present. In the other, he sees the future. Then he sees a new reflection. coward. He now knows what to do. We see G appear like in N’s nightmare, but n almost ignores him. Then l and o appear. He doesn’t care anymore. He will do anything to save his friend. It has all come to this. A disheartened f looks up, and sees n standing in front of l, m, and o. f is happy that his best friend is defending him. l and o still punch them together, but they don’t care, as they’re doing it as friends. They cry out the ; and ?, forming a & before returning. n lifts f up with a sense of relief. Before going to the cave, n hugs p, and cries out a !, remembering what happened when N was down. n and f, now best buddies, go to the cave, not caring what happened a few minutes ago. The camera pans out and we see a baby z, happy with all that was done. *The End.*
L and O is gonna grow up and realize what they actually done so they wont bug F and N again...
Best fortnite duo ever
Bad ending: F regenerates and pulls out an AK-47
근데 예전엔 Z큰상태로 나왔는데 이건 z내
"the ending i wanted"
super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super excellent
I love the part when z use hise power to go back in time
I hope n and f have a good life
The good ending
IT good o(〃＾▽＾〃)o
Wye is L and O mean
1 event in the epilogue: 0:12 Z's Punctuation marks create a large athmosphere that reverses back when f was punched
0:16 This seems familiar.
Finally we get to see baby z
number lore pls
Good ending
Baby z
Love fn
I wonder what happened in the future after this...
F And N Are My Favourite Characters!
Wooow z is huappui
F is friendly
What happened: When Q showed the past in the question mark gem, everyone forgot F was nice, so they were sad. But Z used his gems to reverse time, to fix the friendship. And N was the only one that could see the future when Z reversed time, because Q gave him the question mark. Edit: FINALLY I GET REPLIES AND LIKES
TYSM N🥺
Best epilogue ever!  The fact is that Q and Z have powers but not part of LMNOP cuz Q and Z are underrated use of word
10/10 man
keep making movies
And they all lived happily ever after. Z end.
This Is far of the best Ending, I have seen In MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE

Z is gigantic
I remember when I first watched Alphabet Lore I felt that the ending was unfinished but a continuation would never come out until I saw this, what a heartwarming ending. Also we finally got to see lowercase Z.
THIS ENDING WAS SICK

Good ending unlocked. And for serious i'm very happy N made it! This what he did to P for gift is cute.

I wonder if there will be a number lore
What about  L and O
Wait bit then Z isn't sad so the ... Never existed which means.. he wouldn't have reversed time, so......
epilogue 1 day ago
Now we know what Z's power is. To reverse time BTW Z AND Q SAVE THE DAY INCLUDING N

Where's x
The end of alphabet lore...
I love how Q and Z are the two least used letters in the alphabet but are the two wisest and most important supporting characters in this series.
FN
All of F falts is going on the past where the small letters know
F and N love you :)
I see F is Alive in 0:10
:0
The good ending
L and o ar evil
F is evil but the truth is that F just wanted friends but it is going to the past
the thumbnail spells F u N
Q: QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ puts ? in Ns mouth
The ending we all needed🙏🙏🙏
Who else wants to see their UPPERCASE FUTURE?
This is the ending all of us love to see
No i want everybody to like fF
Why F and N are friends: FuN FrieNds FiNe
N finally did the correct thing
Yay!
Alphabet lore,The numbers Strike!
n become a COWARD
The starting where it showed F dead kind of got me sorrow but when it goes to Z then it becomes crazy I swear
Q at the power of Z like: Q is rolling his eyes
The power of Z
Z is a baby z sucks milk
It shall be called “next time won’t you sing with me”.
lowercase z was cuteeeeee ♡♡♡
pls lanjutin dong
Can you do a part 2 of the epilogue where F and N grow up and become friends again with the other letters?
❤❤❤❤❤
Alright but what if ... Number lore and now I now my 123s
Great 2 thumbs for the ending and the twist
Giga moment number 1: 0:10
Awww tiny Z 2:02
Next time won’t you sing with me
Why L and O bullying f and n? Why they won't be friends?
😍wow that
Oww great ending at least n and f Are friends again
Fav part I - 0:11 | Fav part II - 0:22 | Fav Part III - 1:15 | Fav Part IV - 2:05
Good Ending!
Everybody gangsta until Greek alphabet lore, Accented Letters Lore and Old English alphabet lore come in.
the best ending,everyone ever received
Yayyyyyyyy
f&n
wooooooooooo mini z YASSSSSS!!
So the greatest group F N G P
when you think alphabet lore ends with bad ending:
Honestly, kinda wanted F to win
Its all a loop
Why does lowercased z sound like a grandpa?
Z gede banget
At 1:25 n is saying nnnnnnnn
Z is confirmed as a regular planet not a lava one (GET IT STRAIGHT)
i like how f & n were allies and.. when they grow up, its over.
I like the minute 1.17
Also Z is like "there's a way to make this right!"
The good ending
And Z finally uses his elipse gem
At 0:25 q eyes got longer
f n stands for never ending friends
Next time won’t you sing with me we need it
What would happen, because n knew the future, what is he told everyone what happens, because they don't remember, only N, Z and maybe Q remember???
This is the most happy ending ever in the alphabet lore😢🥹🥹😍
The good ending
Happy z Noises
Rip F
So basically M A N G U and Y or man guy witch I will talk about later they all feel like the bad guys here because they have been chasing F to stop him because they thought he was evil so after seeing the memory Z has had enough of crying and seeing F’s past Z starts spinning the 3 dots/peridots around him causing every letter like T W K L and O can see. so Q and Z are making N go back in time and make things right so N remembers that he is now lowercase him and is now standing up for f and well after that Z is now happy in his youth and now mike salcedo might make alphabet lore after the good ending but I know F has hurt a few letters that are not included in FRIENDS J (blasted) T (hit on the head) C and B (B did nothing wrong just C bit F to sacrifice for N and now with the man guy thing but me something to do with mike salcedo
Ofpof
A la madre, pensé que esto era un fanmade pero es cannon SIUUUUUUUU :v
It's so sad a d happy
1:33 WE MADE A NEW JEWEL!

p's little kiss is so cute 😭
Z still has his older voice even when he was younger and I have been waiting for the time  n will go to f's side
BESTIES FOREVER
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Gud ending
already knew z was going to do something about it
I love this ending
N realized what he has done but Q made him change the time line
F
Full Explanation:  Z Tried To Freeze The Whole World Because Of His Depression And Stop All Letters Killing Each Other So Q Gave N The ? To Go Back In Time. And Here We Are In The Past After L & O Made F Said 'Frick" N Tried To Go With F So They Can Be Friends And F Won't Be Left Out. N Looks Down To Himself Being A Coward But That Wouldn't Stop Him. He Goes To F And Succesfully Became Friends With Him And L & O Kick Them In The Face But F Was Happy Because He Has His Friend With Him. Then They Both Go In The F Cave But Before They Went There N Hugs P Because P Has Always Been On N's Side And After That They Lived Happily And Ever. While Z Had Pure Happiness Because Of What He Witnessed So Maybe This Changes The Present
Z Baby 😄

i have a theory that this is not the end cuz all the titles of abc lore videos were from a to z including n for and before z and this videos title was "now i know my abc's" and the abc song has one more line in it so i think this is not the end Edit: i called it out guys, i called it out
Wow

i feel kina bad for g he fell down agian lol
Why w is useless
PART 2!!?
we needed this
Alternate Title: Alphabet Lore-The Good Ending
NOW I KNOW MY ABC
lowercase z founded
What I’m think & stuff:  The future in Question Mark didn’t went further when F got killed in there. Probably because it’ll only predict further while F is still alive in it’s prediction. Or the further prediction stops when it predicted Z‘s decision to reversed the time.  This made Q figured out that if he didn’t shoved the ? into N’s mouth before Z actives his power, N will remain the same and not knowing the future, creating a time loop where f becomes evil in the future, gets killed, and Z reverse the time. And the timeline repeats if N didn’t get the knowledge and experience about that time he was a coward and F got evil and killed some of the letters, after the time has reversed.  Odd enough, ? was kept in N during time reversation.  During the time reversation, there’s 13 dots moving in the screen. I don’t really know what they could be but, I think they might be the tears Z shedded while the conflicts were happending on him. He first cried when f tipped on n.  After that, n remembered himself as N (shock his head and looked at his leg with that expression). And what o, l and f did to him as he looked at them. Then he looked down to see his own reflection. The mirror under him shows the parallel timeline where he was a coward.  He then decided to change the ‘past’. He walked past letter he used to hide behind when F searched for him. And the letters when he was scared to help f. After overcoming the ‘past’, n looked at l, m and o, showing that he is not scared. f was so happy to see his friend stand up for him, that he and n didn’t mind getting kicked out by the bullies as they looked at eachother.  f & n cried out ; and ?, forming a & before returning to the owners. This marks the friendships between f & n.  On their way to the cave, n hugs p, remembering that she was nice to him during the dark time. And left a ! for her.  At the end, z can finally sleep without worrying about f & n.
so cute and sad it's okay😄🙂
OMG!!!! ALMOST 500K!!!!!
so I guess Q and Z were the true saviors of the story
I done z smiling before in flipaclip and do number lore please!

Q is the true MVP of this series.

Mike should add this into the original alphabet lore video making it 17 or 18 minutes long.
Is P N’s mom? Because P looks bigger than N and she gave N a kiss that’s something a mom would do
Something I just noticed: only F, P and N got the powers. L, M, O, and X don’t have the powers anymore
Awesome

All the alphabet transform
Este vídeo me encantó 😃 la f y la n son amigos
Mike you should do a vid that everyone transforming
I have a feeling that P will be a mother figure for n
WHY DID YOU MAKE BABY Z SO CUTE?
I remember when I first watched Alphabet Lore I felt that the ending was unfinished but a continuation would never come out until I saw this, what a heartwarming ending. Also we finally got to see lowercase Z.
That moment with p made me so happy, the way P died was tragic because she was one of the only kind and innocent ones and now she gets to live a carefree life
The good ending n is friends with f forever
When i first watched the normal alphabet lore i was crying but now it changed  👇 for F
La N Se enamoro de la F 😏
Baby Z?!?!
What in the fuck is going on here??
Read the following word pls   This  Is  A  Masterpiece+    We    Needed    This
S i g h . . . All good things come to an end...SO when's Number Lore?
is p n's mom?
Why does lowercase n voice is so CUTE
The story is actually going like: U,G,A,N,M and Y Were sad for killing F,they were still sad,but then Z Was crying but then he closed his eyes and his ball tears Go round and round super fast,Everyone saw it,Q Drags the Question Mark Into N And then he saw the old memories,N Was Never Ever A Coward,He went pass G Then L and O Blocked his Way,L And O DIDNT know what was happening and then N Chosed F’s Side,F was crying Happy And then L and O Got Angry,L Hitted F’s Back,O Hitted N’s Back and then They were saying N And F said F And they fell,But They were happily Friends again, They went Fast speed,N Went SUPER fast to hug P,N was going back to F And then They walked to the cave,They Were seeing the top and Z Was Saying: Z Until he Closed his eyes That’s how it goes.
😃😌
bro q and z deserve more
The ending was a bit sad Because f and n  Live together and now it got really sad
BABY Z
Fnlmo
Z
Dunno if this is important, but lowercase Z has a lisp.
wwwww so Z was crying the whole time and that’s how Z got that power 😔
Finally Z is happy know
Maybe this is just a part two
I love this ❤️
Now i know my ABCs + Cat F*cking Loves iPods = Now i know F*cking cats
I hope u can make more I love this series
awwww 😭
The Ending. Everyone just realized F dying was not a very good thing, so Q gave N the ? before Z turned back time. when n tried keeping f up he failed and remembered what would happen if he betrayed f, COWARD G came out of nowhere, n walked through, l and o tried blocking n, n walked through and continued to be friends.
Opps
Thank you mike salve do🥲
I just found that on my FYP
I swear he's gonna just start with another alphabet and make trillions
Thank you
lowercase Z sound more old than uppercase
by part 2
My guess is that the next episode is called: "Next Time won't you Sing with me?'"
I don't care how you continue the series just please continue it I love it And I hope you to bo
0:16 KÆ

The music from the last part was my favorite
I'm so happy for F and N.. Wait, what about Next Time Won't You Sing With Me? I think it could either be a movie orrrr.... a sequel series. It can't be an episode because Mike said it's the end. So it most likely will be a sequel.

Oh my gosh I only realised now how well "Now I know my ABCs" works because N now knows all of the letters' motives also I want to appreciate how F and N are the 2 main charactrers because when combined it become FN which is a key in a keyboard and also means "function" so now that they are friends they both function well (act good)
😍😃😃😃
Wow so amazing n dan f bersahabat selamanya
so happy
WAIT! so your telling me this happened right after when N killed F
so that is what z looked like lowercase
The way z says z😂😂
this is crazy but I need it
True ending: N Got the ? And went back in time and actually saw what happened to f so n and f become friends again and Z isn’t Crying anymore
LETS GOOOOO HAPPI ENDING AYYYY
make a another alphabet lore what happends when f grows up from z reverse the universe and n helping f
Z =saturn 🪐
"It was worth losing a tooth" from n, 2001
Now Z has a lower Kaser z
Good ending
I like the Z final part it's cute
0:26
I like the way how n was like  “Hm.” “Oh f went over me..” *o m and l appear* *N teleports to a place* “Wait.. where am I?” I love that part so much
I JUST SAW IT AND IT WAS THE BEST
Man it maked me watch it 20x now
I hope there is a next video 😊  F and N is hang out together with other letters  I don’t know what happened to L’s mind 🤔?
This series is good enough to be a movie
This episode  mwh
Yay finally we see the z lowercase
I love the ending 😭
Idea : number lore
Yipppppppppppppppppppppe good eNding
This is cute
Imagine he makes a post credit scene where it reveals the whole story was told by n in this new timeline and it would be called “Next time won’t you sing with me”
The ending finally came, Just one question I need to ask.   Is adult F alive or is he dead still?
BABY Z
LET'S GO HE CHANGED THE PAST
I like how happy z was though
🥹 thank god it ends happily
I feel like there is f x n in here for some strange reason.
I am love f, n, z
YIPPEE
I bet this video gose viral (•̀ᴗ•́)و
0:24 This word is right  "Everything at the end of time"
good ending omg-
🥺 👏
Siuuuuuuuuuu
noice 👌
See? Everything worked out in the end!!
z Z ya Syifa GG 😘😘😘JL OwO Own N F 💙
Fucking troublemakers l and o, I hope they don't ruin this upcoming new safe future. 1:04 it's fun to see l o symbolising like a switch, as if n was to make an crucial decision. No idea if that was intentional but it's great 👏🏼
Hey Mike, what do you think of the fan-series, like number lore?
Yay
Good ending
This was awesome but I feel that after alaphabet lore we need a NUMBER lore except the numbers are planets and galaxy’s since our universe is giant and possible endless it goes well with infinity and Z can be like our earth But Idk this is just a suggestion
Yey a happy ending.😁😁❤❤
this is the video that is a happy ending also Z made himself z cuz he reversed time back to baby letters and baby n wanted to make f happy again
I originally thought B died but he isnt
this is a good ending its cool and crying masterpiece 👍😭👌
Did anyone notice that G, A, and Y literally spelled gay-
this is so sad
We need sad story
Part 2 alphabet Lore good job
Good ending
🅒🅞🅞🅛
oh
Now F will forget the other childhood and now he'll remember the new one in heaven
😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😭😭 this is so nice from n
Now do part 3 where lowercase l,m,n,o,p letters show their transforms and part 4 and greater where ligatures appear and parts that will show other languages.
And thus ends the tale of why, on some keyboards, there is a fn key.
nice ending
BRO IS COOL WITH Q
O MY GOD I AM FLIPING OUT RIGHT NOW
I'm so happy after seeing this. We needed a part 2 ish.
Fn is final..?
0:10 - 2:03
I prefer the sad ending
O ma ga this is sooo cute when f and n come to the cave
2:02 z Lower case z
F did nothing wrong, for his one friend made sure!
@Mike Salcedo love ya man best series ever pls make another Out that lore video about what happened after N was being nice to F
! ; : & . * ?
I thought this was fan made but at least we knows z’s powers now with his gem
I’m still wondering if the time would change and they would be in the same area but F and other letters that died cause of F are still alive.
So Z's gems can make you go back in time and edit your past actions, very cool!
Setting up my tweeter
What if now since this has ended we had number lore? 😅
Early birds!!! To be honest it’s so good to see such a great epilogue early    👇
muke nake part 3 pls how they become besfriend and a letter trying to kill them pls :(
Z to z
:D
f are friends
Good ending
A beautiful and lovely ending
The scene with p was so wholesome
This is awesome
I love how the time traveled
Is there gonna be another series about the alphabet lore?
Z Is Happy (Happy Ending)
Ame simole

Que buen final
So now the abc is "a b c d e f n g h i j k l m p q z r s t u v w x y"
Wow Z the saver

Try making a good version of the alphabet lore
Now we need a “next time won’t you sing with me”
Yessss that's what I love
GOOD ENDING
z need to remake saturn lol
You can't spell friends...     Without F.
just already at 1:18 im already flooding my bedroom
BABY Z IS SO CUTE
I don't know how to feel about this ending, I mean, I usually hate the "they went back in time so that it never happenrd" approach, but I think this is an ending the fandom desperately wanted
The end?
Hi I'm Z
Now that we know that F it's not a bad letter
F
I was about to cry 😭😭😭😭😭 because n is so nice
Nuber vs alhapbt
So, when number lore
z happe
FINALLY THE GOOD ENDING

Yes the true ending
This is the ending I've been waiting for the friendship of F and N will never end
O:Sorry n. I never bully You.
Who else thinks that lowercase Z is the most precious little thing ever
is anyone gonna notice the fact that Q literally uses telekinesis
0:10
WOW! It actually made me cry, when everyone thought the lore ended, Z finally did something to save everyone, Now f and n are friends…
Will there be more :( like a child hold story of all of them please 27 or 26 I thinkkkk cmon pleaseee
Man I wonder what happened to lowercase Q

Podrías crear ala letra "ñ", se que me vas a ignorar pero bueno
But after N and F enter in F's cave what happen in the future
😂😂😂😂😂

Free sign
No DEF I mean
Oh cute no the free sign Baldi
Z is try to get everyone back to kid and n is never to O and L he get to F he know is he F is saved the N and is happy again
So wholesome, but not able to be wholesome enough to beat the song “friend in me”
0:21 kyooooo

if no belike:
Who most evil?  L:100000% O:1000000% F:1% F didn't do anything!
Yay
The fact that alphabet lore made him 400k subs
And if season 2 comes z might just get in the place and also revive all the dead letters and numbers will come even new transformations!
N helping F is just so cute there was just Absolutely no way I could not cry😢😢❤
BABY Z
People: F was the villain  This video: try me
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Happy Ending.
Everyone is now making z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Si no le dan a este tipo 999 premios Nobels me da un paro cardíaco
Can you do a really bad ending
I feel like and don't feel like this is part 2 of the alphabet lore
n- no- this is just the most epic thing i've ever seen  and also Q is kinda connected to Z, because Q gave N the Question Mark Gem when the ... Gem circle was ending.  oh and i think Mike Salcedo should do AN OFICIAL NUMBER LORE for more views (and money AHSHDHRDHAH)
The ellipsis... (/ɪˈlɪpsɪs/, also known informally as dot dot dot) is a series of dots that indicates an intentional omission of a word, sentence, or whole section from a text without altering its original meaning. The plural is ellipses. The term originates from the Ancient Greek: ἔλλειψις, élleipsis meaning 'leave out'.

I was really happy to the end because Z  Was really happy
n-и до Йоу сее Тхе Сималалритиес
Now z is the hero?
Sad that they were still outsiders, but atleast they have each other! This means that F doesn’t have to go on a vengeful massacre :D. I need atleast a SCREENSHOT on how they turned out as upper cases.
please make more
0:02 N as a grown up 0:21 n as a baby even know he has not been sent to the past yet
どんなにやられてもそばにいることの大切さ...良
I THOUGHT THIS WAS MADE BY SOMEONE ELSE FOR A SECOND
I like that song that Z is doing something
Go back in time
SUPER DUPER GOODEST & HAPPYEST PERFECTEST SMARTEST STRONGEST STRENGTHEST INTERLIGENTEST ENDINGEST
This ending made me cry ;)  (NO BOTS ALLOWED IN THIS COMMENT SECTION NI**A BOTs)
You know i was thinking L and O were gonna get beat up by the other letters for bullying.
What happen to Z
Part 3 please
It would be epic to see a video after this called “Next Time Wont You Sing With Me” where we see the future after Z rewinded time and, N standed up for himself.
make season 2
FANNALY LOWERCASE Z
THE LOWERCASE Z IS CUTE!
WOW I AM LIKE👍😃
I’ve always felt like alphabet lore, that one type of series that happens once in a lifetime
1:33 &

Good ending!
POV: you think this is why people ship F and N together… I loved the video also❤
:)))))))))))
he should do this type of thing more in the future! He could do alot of things such as "World Alphabet Lore"
Make Russian Alphabet lore
o○o
Ive been very excited for this video, it is very well made
#9 on trending already
Are we not gonna talk about how Q shoved the gem thingy in N's mouth?
If they can make a masterpiece out of the alphabet, you can make a masterpiece out of ANYTHING 😮
Without the the letters z would die.
Awwwwwnnnn I loved the ending 🥰
Fun fact:Q is made by Z
This is the happy ending this video is a masterpiece
I CRIED
Best vid of abc ive ever seen!  Hope you make numbers lore next
LOWERCASE Z?
Just Fucking Stop You Bots, Like No One Literally Asked For The Video
I knew this would appear! And dear makers of fan made endings, nice try.
C, H, J, P, X back to life? Pls a new episode with them alive and kicking!
n really went "I forgive you"
Lowercase n could of just went back to when l was pushing f into rick and formed fnrick,which isn’t frick,so they would of not been angry at f
its sad but good ending without the letter Z f will be dead in future ending which is sad😢
literally got me shaking, i love this ending. I doubt there will be more lore being made but at least we know our abcs

The true ending
YASSSSSSS LOWERCASE Z BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Time travel Z And Q did send N to the past
What’s Z said in the end z:what a happy ending 2:03
Part three: F comes back to life it starts to become friends with everybody and everybody’s living their normal life and F revives X, P, C, J, H. And releases D, E, I, R, S. (Idk if he already does) Z will be able to talk to the other letters
1:33 is it me or does that looks like a & ?
Ok Zs power is to time travel
The good ending
:')
Imagine if there was a part 2 called  NEXT Time won't you sing with me
omg bff together I love it but why  z is a legend I'm so sad thx for you vedeos 👍👍👍
F: *Dies* Z: Forget this, let's restart because that's issue so let's go to the past  when the chaos happened  P: Idk why N did that but that's nice
After The Epilogue, N Had To Spit Out The ?, And Him (N) And Q Went Out Of F's Cave, Until Z Was Orbiting In The Solar Sestem. (The Sun Brang F Back To Life)

Hello
I wonder how kid z sound like but it’s a same voice😅
The Z … dots mean the time line of the alphabet that’s why Z go back to time he wanted N to know everything in the past
Depois dessa me fez chorar 😢😢😢
MAKE NUMBAR LORE 1-1OO
Hold up this is just "Now i know my ABC's" So i think there will be a "Next time won't you sing with me?"
the ultimate power
I cried this ending is so wholesome😭😭😭😭😭😭
i loved the series also if you have the time can you do number lore or a alphabet lore lower case version
OMG F LIVED YESSS!!!!!
fn...   FUNCTION KEY!
I didn't know it would get this emotional 😭
10 10👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
when we thought z had the power to end it all it was actually reversing everything
Un final feliz
Happy Ending :D
Not as i expected but i guess the ending is good

Alphabet Lore: The Happy Ending
The true ending.
😭
Next time won’t you sing, *with me…….*       *The Truest Ending*
i cried
This is where the alternative ending is
2:02 FINALLY LOWERCASE Z IS HERE!!!, NO FANMADE AGAIN:)

I LOVE this series!!!
Lowercase z is here!!
0:34 for sm reason everytime i hear F i Feel like he is saying "YOUR ASS" LOL
An aftermath to a popular series...
YES FINALLY ITS BACK!!!!
P just kisses everyone  Ol
this just seems like an entire movie  this was really worth waiting for good job on it :D
I want extra make bad ending! 😜
Z just sent everyone to the past and got his memory so he wanted to change the ending so he went to F to remind that they are still friends
Make a therd
I am so crying 😭😭🥺
I've never seen lowercase z like that. Fan art depict lowercase z as a lava letter.
F x N shippers: **fangirling intensifies**
What a Clutch save Q And Z
F BECAME GOOD AGAIN & HIS BEST BUDDY IIIIIIIISSS N!!! WHAT A SAD STORY
OMG THATS PERFECT I LOVE IT
The reason why Q and Z work together is because in the phone, Q and Z are in the same place on the numeric keyboard: 1.
Now all we need is the "next time won't you sing with me" part
can you make a alphabet lore full version with the Epilogue and the credits please :)
after they see it Z:Time for it to restart Q:Putting ? to N *rewinds* n: how  goes to f *gets the ? mark instead of ;* also f got ; g falls n hugs p n: i love you p p: thanks! *kisses or probably bonks her heads on n* n definitely carried f Z's true lowercase form: Yes! A good ending!
:(
yayayyayayayyyw
Now I see lower case Z For the first time
Lol
I love the alphabet Lord it's the goodest ending
I love F and All alphabet Even Z!
1:20 "this is making me even more ship F and N" 🤓
Z is happy... but why?: That's because the story is about a happy when adult Z is not sad anymore so that's Q need to eat ? Gem to N so n isn't coward anymore and they change their roles. So F became n n became f  When did you see how Z is happy so she is happy anymore.
I wish there was more parts to this. Please make more parts to make this more EPIC! Welp Cya!
The main character is not Z its N/Ñ/n🧡
A B C D E F G H I J K LMNOP Q R S T U V W X Y Z.. Now I Know My ABC's Next Time Will You Come And Sing With Me...
Pls part 3
And that's how I met your dad
Baby z
This is happy ending

Thank z he saved f
BRO THE GOOD ENDING IS SO GOOD SO. EBODY GJVE THIS GUY AN AWARD

i never knew that lowercase z would look like that i thought he was probably like magma as a lowercase letter
What a nice ending to F and N becoming friends again, it brought me tears, and reminded me of my brother together, keep up the good work it was amazing 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Abcdefghigklmnopqrstuvwxyz know my know my abc’s next time won’t you sing with me
I need the full serie about the first alphabet lore but small and they get growing normal
F is not EVIL, F is FRIENDS !😊😊😊
uh oh  here comes the F x N shipping 💀
can you added number lore?
When he announces a sequel, he should call it, Next time won’t you sing with me
He faster 999x episodes abc reversed???
Q and f’s faces are funny
z grew alot in size
Do another one of these but n led no mercy on L & O and N told everyone what they were
Wow n has a BIG HEART in his umm n body❤
What everyone sees in the thumbnail:normal What I see:G, Y and A

OH GOD THE TRUE ENDING
Can you make an season 2 pls, i love this  video, can you? I want it....
Find of weird but IT WAS AMAZING and lowercase z IS SO CUTE
I like how z goes back in time to go back when they were little and q threw the question mark in ns mouth so he knew what happened  it’s just so amazing
Now do Spanish letters
that ending was nice but can u make a prt 2 or alphabet lore 2 that would be nice
“F” could beat the heck out of “O” and “L” easily they deserve to get banished not “F” and “N” but overall this video is a masterpiece and a good ending to a amazing story
GOOD ENDING!!
this sequel i have always been waiting for, what an ending to watch! now that f and n have an relationship they are best friends!
I thought this was fanmade but then i looked at the channel name. the shippers'll be happy about this <3
N n
Z is there again
Good ending:n and f best friends forever
eu tava com depresão eu quando eu assisti esse vídeo eu mim corei
This is perfect
cool MIKE YOU COOL YouTube
A post credit scene would have been nice, like the whole alphabet song with “Q” now have a happier tone😁 Great work to the creator👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
L and O don’t deserve powers so they never got em
The Finale We All Needed
SAD😭
2:00 we finally know what z looks like as a baby
wait... i just notice a secret
up next.... next time won't  you sing with me.
Q was creepy
finaly
This is almost as great as sherk 2
f and n at the end made me happy
bad ending   or    good ending
La n de mi nombre neymar wooo
1:11 I thought at that moment N would take the punctuation mark crystals things, have a brief fight with L and O and literally banish them both to the shadow realm.
for me ive been waiting soo good i love at the end i went "less goooo"
i wonder what happend to R I E D S
Happy ending😭💖
Thank you so much!
I cryed in my cousin house （╯°□°）╯︵(\ .o.)\
so i think F and n will be best friends until they die
Finally baby Z 🎉😢
When I saw this video I literally smashed my keyboard because I didn't have the "fn" key
FINALLY THE ENDING IS HERE  I'm glad f and n are friends
That moment with p made me so happy, the way P died was tragic because she was one of the only kind and innocent ones and now she gets to live a carefree life
OH MY GOD BABY Z IS SO FREAKING CUTE
*this is so sad*
This continúe??
so cute for baby Z
Good ending
next time will you sing with me when
Imagine your parents searched *now i know my abcs* and popped up in the first one
I love this ending so MUCH WOW
n finally becomes Friends with f and z felt bad probs right Mike Salsedo
Yeah besties
it took me so long to realize this that in 0:18 b, t and w are shown as BTW which is the shortcut of by the way
Very good story
f and n
awwwwwwwww
The alphabet Lore was so sad and I wanted to see the last part of it and here it is😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Little z 😍
Of al(it's alphabet lore for short)
0:21 Q XD
I love this
PART TWO
I’m gonna tell you all the epilogue: After G U N M A and Y saw f’s flashback they got worried about him so Z helped them reversing all the alphabet lore so N helps F after he tripped on him so N was being a brave and not a coward so F was happy about it and L and O kicked F and N and then they tear the ; gem and the ? gem and they walked to the volcano and N huged P and he teared the ! gem and P kissed him so F and N got to the volcano and N and F huged each other so Z was to happy and all will live happily ever after The end
Omg crazy lol
Mike imagine if you made a TV series
Z has the power to rewind time, that’s a god power
alphabet lore part 2 please 🥺🥺🥺🥺 17 min
finally, f has a friend
This could be a new ending to alphabet lore
Yes
Such a heartwarming ending❤
New title: alphabet lore (GOOD ENDING)
This is literally the ending we all needed. Mike Salsedo should get another word for this- (P.S. i’m also happy because we got to to see lowercase z :)
I need to watch this new ending when the letters grow😄😄😄
now people are gonna ship them harder than they already were
finally, we got to see lowercase z.
WOWWW
Im gonna cry
https://youtu.be/lXS7chyX9eM 🎒🌩
What we needed to make us feel better
Z OR z
❤❤❤❤❤❤babyz!
And Also, Why Isn't N Supposed To Stop L and O From Trying To Spell The Word Fr**k In The First Place?
A perfect solution to the other video(alphabet lore)
I'm literally crying abt how good this is and the fact N and F are buds now, I wonder how the timeline will go now without F being so mean
Rip f and n's buttlocks got kicked by lol
Wait. they were on Z? I thought it just zoomed to him and F’s cave was in the background.
Good ending
Man Deserves a Noble Peace Prize and Oscar prize!
So this is the only video that will show lowercase Z?

Have ever heard about in the alphabet song "next time won't you sing with me"
BRO THATS WHATS Z BABY LOOKS LIKE

por finn n nnnn
What an amazing ending
YESSS
Omg is baby Z
2:03 LOWERCASE Z FOUND
THIS IS SICK!!!
Now that’s what you call a happy ending!
this is true wholesome
P Deserves That Power Since She Didn't Bully F And Being The Nicest Alphabet
I like how they dont care when they get beat up by the real bastards of the series
we need a "next time wont you sing with me" to see the adventures of f and n and to see what would have happened because of it.
0:02 GAY
But anyways this is coolest video
Number Lore Exist Look At His 4 Or 3 Video (7 Eats 9)
I watched this 8 times now 😅 Edit: I saw this when it was like 36 mins ago after release
Next Episode:Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me?
Lowercase z should sound younger like the others in him :)

Happy ending
0:10 Giorno's theme starts playing.                                                 I, Z have a dream...
good ending :)
Yes f get a happy ending 😊
After the end of the vid:
P is so cute as a lower case
HOW
Neat, can’t wait for the number lore!
Wow
Alphabet Lore: Good Ending
Achievement Unlocked: True Ending
最後に希望あふれる優しいエピローグが見れて良かった。 ありがとう。
What if he makes another one called:next time won't you sing with me....
me watch this for 100th time
I first seen this on tiktok btw
Make more I love this for the continue of N and F please I will do anything
Happy ending 😀
Finally z is here Not Z
I just realized that this might not be the last video, it says, (Now I know my ABCs) but the title doesn’t say (Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me)
Hehe
Idk if n fix the future or not
What gonna happen when they an adult I want to know can you animate another one
YAY
Wait it's 70000
EP.3
Put it all together mike the lore and the epilogue
0:10 you probably don't noticed it   If you pause carefully you can see F alive in the top of the cave
❤❤❤❤
Yay the best ending
Wow just 17hours then 7k likes
N IS FOR NI- * ded *
Alphabet (the good ending)
I been waiting for this
Happy ending
I wonder what happen to n and f
The power of friendship
F may be nice but when n joins the side they be best friends and f isn't evil
i watch it so many times
This video made me cry so hard, this was a masterpiece. We just now need "Next Time Wont You Sing With Me.."... (lets still hope we dont see alphabet lore everywhere)
Also if they just did this in the first place then this entire thing wouldn’t have happened
Are you going to make more alphabet lore?
LOL lmao
Baby Z is Baby Earth
maybe Q and Z is working together
This animation is amazing compared to the other animations
“i’m not crying you are” 🥹
this is my theory:Z reversed the time to save F then Q tells N what to do once N got back in time he chose to be with F instead of choosing the others then they wait for the future to see what was F doing BUT THAT IS JUST A THEORY GUYS
that’s the good ending I think Mike Salcedo always does a great job. Cool and awesome
Welp this is the end I guess
We really need this ending I love it good job😁
Nice !Hopefully the logo kids won’t ruin it if they do copyright strike them to prevent them from ruining your series like they did to every logo in existence
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Can you make number lore and Also number lore final
We need another sequel a sequel of the series but f acting like this and as adults

Me:N!im not going to let those bullies ruin your rep! (Lowercase N escapes to get to f) F:N,Save me! (N stands in front of F) F:*smiles*Thanks,N. (L and O bump into me,F and N) Me:Owwww! (F and N look at each other with happy tears in their eyes) F:You’ll always be my friend. N:I’ll always be yours too. Me:Awww!*Crys happy tears too* F:So N wanna swap gems? N:Ok (? And ; combine to make an & symbol) (;flies to f and ? Flies to N) F:Cmon N.Let’s go. (F and n go to the f cave,but bump into g in the process.N stops to hug P) N:P,Thanks for helping me! P:Awww!Your welcome N!*kisses N* (F and n continue their journey to the f cave and they reach the summit) (Camera zooms out to view Z’s Lowercase form,That no one had seen before) Z:Zee-end.

This is can be a trailer of the Alphabet Lore Part 2
SAD
Shouting to mike scado
The real baby z
Imagine lowercase z in Roblox alphabet Lord RP
Q and Z finally did something to make it end with a happy ending
Happy friendship never stops
Thank you for making a good ending
The great ending: Z reversed the time when they were babies and knew how to stop it from chaos
That was so sad
Aww Cute
The end I literally dreamed
is there going to be a bad ending?
ok but where the hell did the giant stone mountain lair in the shape of F's head come from
Aww this is such a sweet ending
Finally we get to see Z's Lowercase form
now this is a good ending
Wait if we’re counting the last lyrics that means the only words left now are “Next time Etc”🙄
the good ending we've been waiting for
A good ending
wait I found out it spells gay at the thumbnail and start
Can we get more alphabet lore about Z?
1:17 OMGHHUIFEEHIUIJDHWEIUIUHREQWUIQEWWN
Z is so cute when baby lol
Yaaaayayayyaya I'm so glad
AWWWWW SO CUTE 🥺🥰
F and N 🥺
I guess that the video named 'next time will you sing with me' and it could show their adult form and lifes. And I wish G & P become happy
Hey can you do a part three so we can see what happens in the future and the good ending where n and like protects f 😌 please
the ending didn't feel right... we did not see what happens through all over the lore... Again 🤔
Z;( Z:( z:)
Out of everyone who were beating up F, the only one who felt bad for him after knowing the truth was M.  I knew he was my favorite for a reason.
I feel bad about n and f
I just wonder what F is gonna look like grown up with N
OMG
Dayum, Q has telekenesis.
Omg insane cool 😎
true friendship
If g saw p kiss n he be like (ok imma go end ma life
This is heart warming
Please do a chapter 3 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢😢😢 I am a big fan of the alphabet lore
This is basically the athermath
if yall dont like this good ending and like bad endings, remember: - G’s true love kissed N - N has to go through his childhood again (unless he uses the question mark) - Only N went back in time, so the others have to stay there living in regret - All letters still hate F - It is still unknown Future B will survive his injuries and that’s all i got
This is a happy ending 😊
0:14 that Z gems will make you reverse to baby with gems spin
Also s is adorable
Rules to be a planet  1. to be round  2. Orbit a star  3. clean its orbit
Did n just say a different letter?

0:16 KHÆEEEEEE
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This so                   Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
WAIT YOU ACTUALLY MADE THI-
Alphabet lore: Good ending :}
This was the perfect series. It just goes to show that things in the past could be undone if you make up for it. This is just the perfect epilogue to finish it all. But now comes one final question. If this epilogue is called ‘Now I know my ABCs’, will there be a sequel to this epilogue called ‘Next time won’t you sing with me?’
Now z is look like baby
All we have to know now is… next time won’t you sing with me.
OMG YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSYESSSSSSSSS I NEEDED THIS FOR SO LONG
This is I want the ending 🥺😩💔
Is F dead
The changing endings
I didn’t know the alphabet can be this sad
Lowercase Z??????
Please dont end the alphabet lore series 🥺🥺
Finally i found Lowercase Z
We need part twos and part three  AND part 1 million :} we need more of this

Anyways. Bye!
Time has been reversed, so now all the letters are lowercase. They were uppercase in the end of nZ, but N ate the question mark gem so they're all lowercase now (and it's not a flashback)
Pls make f alive in the power of z

Good ending:

This part is look a movie is Amazing
F
This is so heartwarming it’s just a bad ending from the original one now it’s a happy ending from this one and also everyone finally got to see lowercase z. And this one is better than the original one
baby Z
Dang, I knew Z would have a greater role in this

The true ending (Tʖ̯T)
You would finally see what Z looks like when he was little
nerf
Finally z is happy
Awh (*´∨`*)
Why does this look like it's fanmade-
Gay and fun
No matter what happens,stay determined
0:10 Did anyone else notice another F on top of mountain for sec.

I actually watched The whole series 291 times and it's so good
Numbers lore?
I swear if people start shipping these 2
What Baby Z ? How
N and F
The  ending was sooo good
I think if the story were to continue on through the bad ending, then i think J and O would be the new villians
The End Alphabet Lore We See The Coward
No wonder baby z sounds still the same like normal z
The true ending of alphabet in Lori‼️⁉️⁉️‼️⁉️‼️⁉️‼️
guys just have the thought in you’re head *number lore*
I liked f and z and n This Cool
2:12 End!
This cool little effect on 0:11 on the “…” is very cool! So it’s like going right meaning that time is going forward. Z reverses it so the “…” goes left instead to reverse time. That’s so cool!
:,)
I may have missed being able to see the videos when they first uploaded, but I’m damn happy I was around to view the (real) ending when it first aired yesterday. ❤
We all needed this.
Well in this timeline N didnt betray F
Wow is so amazing 🥺 N and F
Lower case Z ?

Wow
Part 2 is cooler then Part 1 Thank you Mike Salcedo
wait so did N travel back in time to be friends with f cause he felt bad? but then who will be the one killing F? or does F be happy with N?
Good ending
Then they both become the villains

Good ending
Z, the master of the alphaverse.
Pls is this a trailer for alphabet lore 2
Ending was true!
considering that people are bit torn on this ending, i want to give my opinion on this  this ending is really good. but you also kind of need to have been here since the beginning to really enjoy this. and here's why.  this ending, even if this isn't what it's meant to be, in many ways, this feels a lot like a big thank you for the amount of support and love Alphabet Lore received.  it feels a lot like we wouldn't have gotten this ending had that not been the case, but we did get here. and it feels so, so rewarding. and so so good.  and i can't believe that this almost made tears flow down my face  thank you so much Mike, for the amazing series.
the lowercase z  finally exits
Even good ending made me cry
N and F are best friends as I know. Ns gem to F  and Qs gem to N! This is awsome
F

YAY BEST FRIENDS

Imagine a "next time would you sing with me "   This is beutifull, the ending that we needed
i noticed an animation error at around 0:10 If you look closely you can see an alive F in the cave even though he was killed I think the shot was taken from nZ in the zoomout to Z

What a perfect ending!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏
FINALLLY! THATS WHAT WE NEEDED.. THE BABY Z..
FUNfact: theres a word in the thumbnail the word is FUN
We saw baby z the time, he wasn’t like old earth like we thought but he’s just a normal z still, thus ending it a million times better.
Z, you really outdone yourself
There could possibly be more, the last lyric in the song is “next time won’t you sing with my”
make a part three
Awwwwww final happy this she need now a Oscar
Zs power: to change time itself to the past or the present and future.
Mmmmmm, I liked the tragedy. This is great, but a tragedy was well, tragic. So retconning it felt worse, still, great ending.

Q: *EAT THE DAMN QUESTION MARK*
It makes you cry
:)
Yes just yes
I LOVE IT. here's your reward: I will subscribe to you :)
The Ending was so Dramatic
alternate title: alphabet lore good ending
N and F:)
Resume: After knowing the whole tragedies that would happen Q and Z decide to act together to go back past and fix everything. Q gives N the ? power that would give him its conscience about the present. When it comes back in time Little N sees again its friend get bullied and hated by everyone , but this time he knew that he was an coward in past but now, he would do what he should have done long time ago. L , M and O make the most possible to dont make him talk to F, but he refused and protected its beloved friend as F saw that he wasnt alone at all. L and O kicked them to teach them an lesson but it did not work at all. So then they distribute to each other their gems and walk to their home. In the way,  N saw P and gave her an huge hug because she protected him as same as F. So then N and F walked and saw their beautyfull view , and F sure was happy enough because he at least had an friend in its side that would protect him whatever costed. And Z, satisfied with the good ending that HE needed smug as F and N grew together and lived happily after... The End.
P is a thot confirmed
Next time won't you sing with me!
WE NOW KNOW WHAT THE SEMICOLONS DO
you.......... did......... that?!?!?!??!?!
So the … gem controls time
Baby Z???
I remember when I first watched Alphabet Lore I felt that the ending was unfinished but a continuation would never come out until I saw this, what a heartwarming ending. Also we finally got to see lowercase Z.

Te reto que subas un vídeo de number lore
after watching this 6 times i finally understand it z made it so that n got the question mark instead of q, so he knew what would happen, and could change it himself and we finally found out the purpose of the ellipsis & we also finally got the ampersand, to show that it is f and n, they are together
Wait does that mean f and n are the bad guys now
That is 100% make people  😭
I really thought it would end with f betrayed. I almost cried through out there...

Nossa essa parte 2 de alfabeto Loure Foi muito legal você tem Muita criatividade
I love lowercase z
Baby z
Make series
Happy end yay
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!!!
Part two?
;( f me
I find it respectful how n saw the future and thanked p for helping him in the now alt future
space in alphabet lore is purple not cyan
You should do þ it was removed from the alphabet so you should do it(the replacement for þ is th because French people couldn’t pronounce it so it got removed)
The ending we didn't ask for, but the ending we deserved
Baby z!
no thorn? No &? No long s
Okay, but where is "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me?"
It’s finally to see lowercase Z
Cute voice of all time 1:26
:0
How about you make one with voices like the part 1
The good ending
Theory: Z travelled in back in time to a baby so we could help FNF will never ever attack a letter again
Omg
finally we get a glimpse of child z
Name: Z And z
Make a part 2 but with numbers!
This will be the ending for my number lore
Now I know my abc? Where is next time won't you sing with me
Noice
BEST ENDING You saved F from being bad
I thought this was fanmade until i looked at the channel wondering who it was-
0:10Z...
And All The Alphabets Are Living A Happily Ever After.
Awesome
I’m literally crying irl this Is so sad and happy
I did not know there was a baby Z! There were are few fanmades, but they kinda looked good.
.________________.
Hi
LOWERCASE Z IS HERE!
I was about to cry
Great now we’re dealing with time travel! You might all think this is a happy ending but there’s still the timeline where the events of the lore take place in. That timeline didn’t disappear, if it did then this one couldn’t exist. There’s still a F, J, P, X, H and C that are dead.
Good thing F and N are best freinds now and the lowercase z showed up
Hey yo think about it number lore
little q
Lengends will always say z is a god.
Ngl this is way better than the previous alphabet lore. Z finally gave a chance to all letters to time travel to fix mistakes, n fixed his mistake so f is no longer evil and finally we can see baby z.
Why does K always talk when something happens
Am super happy I allmost cried
WOAH SO COOL
Mike Pease make a second series for alfabet lore please?
When a 2 minute video makes you cry harder than a 2 hour movie. This series was a masterpiece.
Finally A official Lowercase Z
Yoo
Then F never became into villain
We need a sequel to alphabet lore.
anyone else notice the thumbnail spells out "gay fun"
I felt bad with f.the bad ending to good ending it’s a so good
Ok!
finally, the ending we needed
А так задумано, что зрачки F пропали?
And they lived happily ever after… the end
Mike Salcedo plis part 4  Edit: parte 4 para ver lo qué pasó a la n y a la f
The fact that my name starts with F and my bffs starts with Z…
DO NUMBER LORE!
Tiny baby z
We want number lore
I see, if Z reversed time the ending would be the same. But Q put the ? Gem in N's mouth at the last second bringing back his memories after Z reversed time!
Z when:
Wow wow wow wow no me apuro qué es historia escribe yo quiero pastel húmedo te te te yo quiero una 3 porque quiero saber si esa está se vuelve mala con la letra f o si cambia y futuro y opone muere y no se hace malo yo quiero esta historia quiero saber si se vuelve malo o no se mueve
🥲😭🙂
The way P kissed n though ☠️
Malo)la l&o
Now do the Numbers
1:17 that face.
i never realized how many letters were in that cave
can you make  alphabet lore the series but  F is good
I wish for more alphabet lore content
Épico 👌
Dang when I first saw this I thought it was fan made, but then I checked the creator and yep it’s the official ending to the alphabet lore
:O
I don't mean to rush you Mike but when are you making an F plushie cuz I just want to know
good ending????
F 🥲
that ending almost made me 😭
wait for there are still some stones left does this mean that there can be a continuation of letters vs numbers ?
Yes good eding
“Sometimes, an ending is more powerful than a beginning — Especially an epilogue.”   - Z, from the Alphaverse.    Edit: I am gonna make Q’s Theme about this, in orchestra mode.   ITS ORCHESTRIN’ TIME
Now z said "Zhheeeyyyyyynddd"
There, that's better
This is PERFECT!I hope F doesn't do it again, I'm looking forward to it if you can do it more!
My brain: why u continued pisting videos
this guy needs a Oscars award for this.
Perfect happy ending
lowercase z Q put eyes on N Z look like saturn
ADD MORE
Before I saw this I was crying in my head for the hole day water in my eyes yk
I expect more but this is awesome! Good job bro
Now we need what happens next in the present Plz
2:00 Wait- LOWERCASE Z?
Good ending:n makes friends with f
i didn’t Notice that Z is turn into Lowercase Z
Z and Q probably the strongest alphabet
what a happy ending :)
Baby z is cute
Baby z = cute
coward?
Ураа
Awwwww so sweet😊
the good ending.
The good ending.
Hell yeah better than a tv show
Good ending 😭
😪😪😪😪😔😔😔😔
NUMBER LORE NEXT
If there’s a now I know my ABCs where’s Next time won’t you sing with me?
This video is very good
I I know is right
0:02 it’s funny that L & O wasn’t there
WE NEED A SEASON 2 BUT NUMBERS PLEASE🙏🙏🙏
Oooo
No way there this can’t be the end
P
Let's go I thought it ended
LOVE IT! NICE ANIMATION BTW!
All the 3 true heros: Z, N and Q
I like it
there gonna to be a sequel?
Ok f and n hate every and kill L and O
So Q and Z are helping N to become lowercase again so he can be friend with f hmm interesting…
yes new ser
Yay :)
Fn= Finale also known as finish
Complicated to make.
Most replayed 2:03
Z Ti voglio bene
so z had a lowercase after all
That was sad. But is there going to be chapter 2 and is the deceased alphabets will be alive?
FINALLY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WE GET TO SEE LOWER CASE Z                Thought I was gonna say smth else?              OK you can go now...                      You’re still reading?                      You’re wasting you’re time                                Let me guess.... you’re bored?                    Not trying to solve world boredom
the question mark ? and semicolon ; coming together to make an ampersand & was such a good touch
its so happy
No one noticed how like at 1:48 it is like png lol that was fun
Now p loves n not g
AAAAAAA F GOOD
the best end ever
This was the best way to end the series
A true ending to alphabet lore, Z and Q are real heroes here, Q gave N the question mark before going back to the past to know what was gonna happen in the future and Z turned back time to give N a second chance. What an amazing ending F and N can now really be friends and nice seeing baby z, great job Mike! Also L and O are the real villains tbh
I ship it.
yay :D
what is the music that plays when z does the forcefield thing?
This epilogue is very emotional for some reason  Wonder if the plot twist that N will defend F at all costs  Like if you agree 👇
0:24 CURSED Q still very good ending though!
Lucky they got F back
I prefer original ending cuz I love depresión
Make more pls
F is dead or alive
Do alphabet lore but Russian
Why are l and o such bullies ?
Who else thought that N was gonna beat the heck out of L and O in the epilogue? Because I did.
Congratulations for making the BEST animation I have ever seen! Here is a Starbucks gift card 📁📮💌
wow.. only wow i love this cause i love f and that is a good job... I'm going to suscribe now
I like How the music is like the A B C D E F G
Finnaly lower case Z
2:02 Let me guess what I am seeing. Lowercase Z?! *OOOOMMMMGGGG*
The true ending
finally, baby Z
They way that I saw Z he a baby happy baby
This was so adorable seeing N be friends with F, and this of course being completely for the F x N fans which they will eat this up. However it's depressing how something as good as this will be tainted by youtube kids creators soon looking for money, it has already begun with some popular youtube kids channels making videos on this...
make Q plush
I loved the ending.
Q and Z work together
Cool baby z no more fire (littataly) fanmades
Make the letters apologize to f now
Ngl when I seen Z was “…” I knew something else was gonna come up and well here we are
this vídeo IS SO sad
OMG  GOOD ENDING  ITS AMAZING   😭✨👌
Yes! a good ending!
We. Neeed number. Lore pls I want itt
así resolvemos unas preguntas como la forma bebé de Z
Other people: Awww z looks so cute! Me: HOLY SHI- Also me: Wait why dose n have no eyes when standing in front of f?
The ending we deserve
E
1:07 everyone: mad at F J: 😏
Thank you mike salcedo
AWWWWWW
when i watched it i really feel bad for F he didn't do anything wrong they punched him to make "frick" word
That's one of the few videos that I give a like for, you deserve it
If it had zoomed in on n and f standing next to each other and faded out to Fn~ that would have been even better
Esta saga continuará :O?
This is so good I love how both f and n are friends this is a happy ending!
thanks for the finale I have been waiting for it for a long time
Zeeeee more like yeeeee
this ending is so good it looks like a fan created it
Pov: Im 1
I like how lowercase z just close they're eyes or sleep its just so cute
2:03 Finally, we see Z as a lower-case.
this is aweasome, i Will cryyyy 😭
F's backstory was actually pretty sad but now that Z and Q were able to turn back time to back when they were children and N was able to make sure those bad events never happened. The 2 make very good friends. We also now got to see what baby Z looked like.
I knew those crystals had powers
Omg el ship se iso real
im crying
btw
If this was the good ending WHATS the bad ending?
Best ending ever but for some reason baby z reminds me of a dog
I LOVE THIS CUZ ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE
Awwwwwww, also now we know z (baby Z cuz some people anyway think the adult versión even trought the baby versión is lowercase)
Everyone gangsta until Next Time Wont You Sing With Me comes out
I know this one o got shot at n it spells on
OH MY GOSH THATS A GOOD ENDING!!!!!!!!
I almost cried with happiness in this video because of the happy ending
alphabet lore version cute y like this version 🤗🤗🤗🤗 snif
Thank you for the good ending!!!!
It'll be cool if we got to see what happened after n changed the past
What would happen to z if q never gave the ? To n
We finally see lower case z

Wait the z is make a time travel for all alphabetp?
Can you do next time won’t you sing with me?
YAY YES I HAPPY ENDING
Part 2
When Z has cried 3 tears, he can rewind time. Now that’s cool. Good thing Q gave N the question mark on time so that history doesn’t just repeat itself
lets go n i got my respect back for u
R,I,E,D and S are traitors
that was nice mike salcedo and now f and n are friends😀
Gimme more
Also I just realized that Z‘s   tongue  is orange
Bro please tell me this is canon Even do I like sad stories this makes me wheeze in a good way
1:59 iow is baby z finally
wait a minute, doesn't "next time won't you sing with me" still exist?! OK no way... right?
♥️z
2:03 lowercase z is the most cutest bean i've ever seen, hey @Mike Salcedo can you make a plush of him pls? i wanna hug him so bad
I need more. NOW.
(:
Can you make the future them if this happened
At least some respect gets to F and the fact f and n are actually my favourite characters
woohoo the good ending yayyyyyyyy the ending we wanted yayyyeydyeunwyrhwuqhfucnwiwjorjcwlwikfpwowjfofjiekwpwldr
And with that, Lowercase Z is finally canon!  And now we know what Z's "..." gems were for.
Do a secret ending
Finally good ending :)
2:02 LOWERCASE Z??????
0:12 so that's what the ellipsis (...) gem is for!
continue this series plzzzzzzz
i was thinking it was a fanmade BUT NO ITS ORIGINAL DAAWWGGG
Watching this sorta confirms a “theory” I have about M   Even M is in the “cool club” or the “popular ones” whatever M seems to be the nicer one to N out of LMNOP.      P is too I was focusing more on M in this comment
Chapter 3 when
If you wanna ear a cursed ship scroll down                             What are you doing?                            You think that im gonna show you?                        Nahh bro                  Alrhigt if you really want it There you Ave it                                                F X N
y e s
Man is official and i got never know
Wtf._.
Good eding: you are good whit F
Yay the end:]
Calix mad, if you see this stop advertising you videos on these comments. You can’t just do that
There would be a season 2 with numbers :)
You can do like a alphabet lore 2 here shows they grow up F and N together with they friends and they will need to fight numbers?
The next season should be numbers
Baby z and I am happy for n and f
omg i love this soooooo much
The good ending
Yes finally
1:41 pog.

0:24
@Mike Salcedo your alphabet lore series will still be out there and this is your best series of all time on your channel and I love and support it what a happy ending ☺ and it's still popular 10 likes every 4 minutes and did you forgot cursed images credit to you the finale and f and n are now best friends 😍 and HKtito is probably your clone Alphabet Lore (A-Z...) Is so popular it went viral N saved all Q no damage Friends Z gem power is shows past and future and turn to blue
LETS GOOOOOOO
We need another video called "next time won't you sing with me?"
Finally.. THE GOOD ENDING
N and F: enemies before, friends after😊😊(even N killed F before)
OH YEAH IM MR.CRABS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Awwwww
The end of the first video was increible but this epilogue makes the ending 100x better great job making this video
Number lore when
no one noticed the f on top
Something many may have missed is that it says F corpse u n and Y form the word Funy, which may be a throwback to them as children, making fun of the two friends, and now as adulta they ask themselves if it's really funny now..
f ❤ n
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️‍🩹
P X G
Are you going to let RIEND and S down we are you going to just let them hang there
WAIT I THOUGH SOMETHING! LOWERCASE Z WAS NOT MADE OF LAVA!
And Z is also my middle name
2:03 YES WE FINALLY SEE Z AS A KID AND HES FIXED
in the words of Ugly Duckling from Disney's Chicken Little: "Now that's closure"
if there was a chapter 2 i wonder if numbers or shapes would appear. it would be cool, it will probably be very unlikely but still
you forgot next time wont u sing with me
good ending from f and n
I happy ending🤗
Good ending! They realize what they did and Z want to repeat time and then Q helping too with giving the ? To N so N could control when they young so the future is in n hand now beacuse he aleardy know in future so n decide to choose f friendship.  Worth of the wait =  -z lowercase! Finnaly!! -a good / happy ending! -F is no more revenge -q doesnt need to chasing everyone -f and n become friendship -z is no more having blue ball and happy Not worth of wait = -f and n gonna be enemy of l and o (maybe there a chance that everyone would hate f and n) Mystery = -What would happen in future if n decide to have f friend ship? Is that L and O gonna have revenge? Hmmmm Theory = -Maybe blue ball that Z have is mean he get sad story from his alphabet -Maybe Z is repeat time with blue ball -------------------------' And the series is good i like it! Thx for making my day and bye!!
IT'S A FUCKING MASTERPIECE!!!!!!
Lowercase z?!?
I was gonna subscribe to say this was the truth about F
Better than anime
Z atchuly did someting to save evreyone
Z gems were spinning?! GOD DAM
Now we could put a lowercase z inside of the role plays
Thanks Z ❤️
0:10 F?
So that z he's a baby good ending
f n z
Wait but what happens later on when they grow up, Will F still be friendly?, Or do his killing spree over and over to spell a word?
Oh my God Dad is so happy ending
Q has telekinesis?
Wow i can believe it this is the best ending for me :)
If there’s another episode, it should be called “Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me..”
OH NAH THIS WENT FROM NOTHIN TO NUMBER 16 ON TRNEDING  EDIT:now 15
Good ending F IS good now
Thank you so much for a happy ending on a Alphabet Lore! This is what I really have been waiting for 🥹! Now sense you did this, I will sub to You!
DO A BAD ENDING WHEN F REVIVES
2:00 z
This is the first time that a series tried to make me cry and it almost succeeded ( in a good way)
Baby z is so cute :)
𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘰 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘰𝘰𝘭
This is much better than the other ending
i cant stop watching this help me pls
ÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞ
Now N and F are finally happy......   ;)
"Now I know my abcs"  Next time you won't sing with me

Next thare Must be a war of 123 VS ABC
Zi
The good end
SOOO CUTEE
so is G or N the main character?
Anyway the best animation i've ever seen in my life
Very interesting with how Z managed to send N back through time using his own tears
Why is no one talking about Q's handoff of the question mark?  Smooth move.
make number lore pls
Yea thanks to Z for rewinding Time and Q for giving N the question mark Gem now they solved the issue in the past now we know what the epilipsy Gem does
If Z's Power is going back throught time, how many he reseted the whole story until now?
Oh how lucky I am to have just seen the Alphabet lore vid. What a splendid ending!
i don't want it to be the finale after the next one there should be the episodes aa, ab, ac and so on
i love this
Wait a second...
And just like that! z is created!
ok so, this is done, but... if this is the real end... no... WE NEED MORE A 2CN PART OF THIS LIEK THIS IF YOU WANT 2ND PART THIS NEEDS A REAL END
The ba- I mean good ending
Z power is made in heaven?
Yay
0:48
So z saw f was alone so he bring cry to bring small letter in 2018 and q give n the ? to n and n became friends with f and f was happy and f and n and f we're putting chessk in n and n let f put her chessk in her and z didn't cry so good ending and ABC letter f was alone and cry out of power and got mad that n didn't came and f went away and p and g was kissing and f went top to see n and z see f got sad and he grow up with little z and he cry and turn them small letter to 2018 and that was the bad ending
Saturn Z
WHAT ABOUT J?
How many times do you think Z had to rewind so they could save The Alphabet?
It was worth the beating. F is my homie.
Unpopular opinion, I kind of liked the “bad” ending more.
I noticed something those balls that Z crys are each moment in the timeline that happened sense everyone was fighting he got more cracked as all of them fought in each moments  Edit : I’m saying that Z basically reversed the timeline
Make Next Time Won't You Sing With Me, the last part!
I am so confused
Z IS LOWERCASE
KYOOAOAAAAAAOOOO
L and O are such jerks
Every famous Youtuber is reacting and do Omg this is great I’m like and subbbbb
is this part 2
Ok people that thought Z can do nothing he can with the … gem
Too bad that in the last timeline all those events occurred anyways.
Sad to happy
Wow I save all if them I'm the latter Z 🤗
This is heartwarming
♥️
Z just committed time reverse
F successfully got N power N has successfully  got F power L and O failed to get : and .
Everything is a masterpiece, and a really good ending to end it off. 10/10, and thanks Mike Salcedo for bringing it to us.
Everything is a masterpiece, and a really good ending to end it off. 10/10, and thanks Mike Salcedo for bringing it to js.
show us what it will look like in the future now :D
This made me tear up so hard, I’m so happy that N and F stayed friends
i wonder if we will see the future now but without F being evil and actually best friends with N
The beat up smiling f looked cursed- *EDIT:* Can you also make a next time won’t you sing with me Epoligue where the letters basically free the chained up letters? Also I like how P kisses so cutely and fast
Nice.. I’m literally crying...
F and N are a gay couple confirmed
Lowercase Z is so cute❤
oooooh maybe you can do a show of the adventures such as they can double themselves to make longer words or they meet the numbers
The finale we thought we had, has been replaced with something better
Tbh, now I wonder if there's gonna be a sequel even if N and F are friends again, there's still more of those Punctuations that L, M, O, P, and X have. So.... sequel?
THE GOOD ENDING :D
awe so cute
Pan 6 and ➿  "Y" whyyyyyyyyyyyy "G" sad "Z" is Time "Q" here "N" *Eat?* "f" aaaaa *falling* "n" ok  "I and O" hey *get lol* "n and f" *Run* "n" *go to p* "p"*kiss n* " z" yayyyyyy
Sequel maybe
F HAS A GOOD ENDING LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
cant wait for season 2
Lowercase Z is so cute
This should be on the oscers nominations, this was just so in the wow and twist factors. Even though n and f are bullied and sad, that doesn't matter as long as they have each other. Another thing I love is how it shows the message and view of what is being told and how it was broght to perspective. Really well done creator.
I thought it was over, BOY WAS I WRONG!
Wow a good ending
Please make numbers lore .
Wow, The Fact that both we get to see lowercase z and that n has a black eye (at 1:22) is just amazing!
I wonder if there’s gonna be a “...Next time won’t you sing with me?” Part. Y’know, just for fun and isn’t canon?
n and q to gem YUMMMY
Z at the end just be like, FINALLY I CAN SLEEP IN PEACE
crying bc good ending
unexpected
Wow the second part
Wow. What a great ending.
1:58 Z baby
I wish that Mike didnt make that epilogue i Wonder what the alphabet lore could be if F was not the villan!
Good ending
Omg
Wow Q really was the savior in the end kind pf
L O São Do Mal!
We Stan Q
OH MY GOSH HAPPY ENDINGGGGG YESSSS I CRI
Just imagine If there a season 2 with number lore
I want you to make the the lore numbers but I want them the beat the color of the alphabet lore but 7 will be the villain
This is my favorite series ever
Lowercase z would have been cooler if he was magma, but he is still cool no matter what,
Ayo is P Ns mom?
La parte 2
I was about to tear up what a good ending
man, this makes me think that Q is the real hero here, he did everything to make everyone know what happened to f and why he is evil, he then sended n to fix everything with the help of the planet z, q saved us...
And everybody lives on 😀
Bro got me crying over letters and I love it!
Bro I actually cried when f and n were beated down and goed to f's house
Coward spelled by baby letters
I like how the A video got turned to kids allowed, the same thing will probably happen on b and c
God damn
ITS NOW A GOOD ENDING YAAAAAY f & n are now best friend 💖💖💖😇😇 thx for z and q for a good day
So now we know that the Elipses (...) has "time travel/do over" powers.
It's really incredible that this guy managed to make story and character development for literal letters. Imagine the projects that he could make after Alphabet Lore!
The events that I predict will happen after the events of the epilogue:  1. N fixes F and F would feel bad for the damage he has done in the past, so he and N help fix the dead letters (C, H, J, P, and X) and all the letters let F join in since the Epilogue shows N and F having their second chance.  2. All the letters would do their same intro sequences, and F would no longer attack or kidnap any letters and he would be a nice letter.
if our asses get beaten our asses get beaten together
best. birthday .ever
1:17
This end sucks
Me thinking alphabet lore was over
the good ending so nice
We're still missing one more part of the song, next time won't you sing with me?
It’s been 2 months
Hey Mike salcedo I made the alphabet lore humanized cuz I made it like happy ending and sad ending of backstory
Oh ok
Me after realizing this is by the actual creator:
‽‽‽
The ending thats no one requested, but everyone needed.
0:18 the letter spell "btw" which means "by the way"
Happy end
Good ending
Z looks kinda happy right now ngl
And this All stArted with the letter A..
Baby z is here YES
Q is like some elder wizard who knows more than everyone in the universe combined
Like the fact that Y eyelashes look like these ,
Lowercase Z looks so cute!
Cringy shippers: so anyways I started shipping
The Number Lore
I thought after N stood up for F and got beat up even more by O and L.. I thought the other letters would stand up against them.. L and O should’ve gotten what they deserved but didn’t
Is F and N ga- WAIT do a season 2 with numbers and the letters being the numbers parents
The good ending
Didn't expect this ending!
At least it’s a happy ending now, and if no one noticed when F died it pans out in the letters he kidnapped we’re trying to spell friends he couldn’t get his hands on N and N killed F
Now, where's "Next time won't you sing with me?"?
How would you feel if I told you that there is "fan art" of F on certain websites?
POV:the good ending Now can we please get the number lore and have zero 0 be the planet
Imagine a part 2 where n and f get revenge
We get ending new end
NYAAA NYA NYA NYA NYAAA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYAAAA NYA
Im so glad there ended up being a happy ending after all
Yayy another masterpiece from this guy
he's probably gonna make  another one called Next time won't you sing with me
Read Desc
❤️
Z Is the word.  N and f are friend
Z is one of the last letter most Helpful letter helping letter to be helpful for saving F but he wasn’t bad now this is crazy but I like your videos 😅
1:51 Enough to make a men cry
Cool
Hope there’s a sequel, this was amazing and it really needs one, maybe like a new type or mini episode’s.
1:41 Poggers P
we NEED to see what happens next! make a sequel Pleeaase!
I thought Z no power, but I was wrong the travel past and future
Look That’s Lowercase z
Wow, this has been a great series
I LOVE THIS!!!!!
Q is the true mvp
0:21 Q's eyes bro
I love how Q used telekinesis with his eyes 0:23 and F & N became best friends. And at 0:25, I loved when Z turned into an orb.
Next:next time you won't sing with me
I did notice that z has cracks beacuse N who shoted in F made crack from F's cave to Z
The true ending we all wanted
F IS for friends that do stuff together, and N is for anywhere, anytime at all.
i agree That Z and Q worked together to make everything goes normal
Possible episode: Next time won't you sing with me.
What
Bro if there’s a chapter 2 it’s going to be lit
I didnt realize this was from the og creator
My god I didn't tell you going to make a new Apple ID what time so we can happy
🥶
Season 2?
Why does z look cute
THE SHIP EXSITS!!!
I thought it ended
He really decided to make the perfect series perfecter, and I’m here for it.
0:01 0:10 0:16 0:22 0:34 0:40 1:00 1:04 1:10 2:03 1:20 1:22 1:24 1:26 1:57
I never watched the vid so idk what Z does
F: YO F! Me: I hate alphabet lore now. F and N: (becoming friends) me: I actually still like it
I like this but i think i preffer the og ending ngl, because now people hate both of them so its even sadder
I knew it was L and O fault and f was innocent
This is just so sad happy🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
pls altarnitick ending :)
I knew this couldn’t end like that
𝔻𝕚𝕖 BULLIES
N or F had to kill L and O, if not will be a CHAOS.
I have a feeling there’s going to be more episodes of what happens with all of the letters after this and how N’s and F’s relationship carries over.  We all love the work you have put into all of your videos and we can’t wait for what’s to come in the future.  Keep up the amazing work!
Yay good ending 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can we have a continue?
Happy ending       Happy ending.

THIS IS A MASTEPIECE
Ty for bringing us an official baby Z!
This Is Super Emotional Man You Deserve More Subscribers Look At These Views...They Should All Subscribe
Omg I love this so much, finally a happy ending❤
q z and f are my favorite
the letter z made it with the power of tears made it go back in time and the letter q gave its power to N to be able to fix everything he had done wrong and then we have a good ending that's how I understood it   (I CAN'T STOP WATCHING).      I hope to have more continuations of Alfabhet lore
Here come the shippers
fn = good ending
Yes N & F friends forever with P
F i N
"I'm not crying! I'm just creating ellipsises!" (Or is it ellipsii?)
YHEAAAAA!!! I KNOW IT!!! :,) EPILOGE!!! i cried.z the more awezome is z
0:10 you can still see F on top of the cave if you pause it
At least we know what lowercase z looks like now!
The most lovely ending
Q и Z такие чувства будто они всё знали (ну Q точно)
This is one of the most original and Well-made thing I’ve seen in the past couple of years and I’m glad it Ended a great story in such a good way
Please part 3
Good job bro
When a 2 minute video makes you cry harder than a 2 hour movie. This series was a masterpiece.
FINNALY. THE BABY Z.
I never expected a masterpiece like this! 🥲🥲🥲
I love this video continue pls❤️
Can you do a continue of this alfabeth lore?
Now is that house it looks like when she was a baby I thought he was red but he’s white so yeah that’s what I thought
Eu quero que você faça a versão feliz só que a história completa é normal que você criou só que com final feliz que letra n e f ficam juntos até crescer tem um final que a letra f não morre
Yes a happy ending
Thit they save everyone?
Wow
Finally, we see lowercase Z
Wait but then f and n would both be evil in the future
YASSSS
Finally a good ending!
Happy ending
Wowie lets gotinuation. Understand? Go tinuation
imagine he makes "next time won't you sing with me"
I almost cried 😭
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
N is the hero
Thx Q and Z for the help  This ending is soo sad and cute ngl  Soo wholesome 😌
maybe there could be more planets with diffrent languages lol
Can make an alternate alphabet lore based on this video
and q z
Lets gooooo no dark ending
l and o are the bad guys and f and p hellped n out 😊
Your making smile
z even as a kid sounds terrifying
man this ending was very emotional very sad 😭 who thinks like  👇
N saved f
It took me this long to realize that the "n" video was secretly trying to say "Y & Z" the whole time.
Mike, start a new "Number Lore"! I would be very happy about that 😄
Make an "Alphabet Lore: F's Revenge", where by the power of the symbols, F comes back to life, and it goes on from there. Also N and F team up
0:07 - 0:26 my favorite part
Good ending n ignore o and l and help out and got bully together and gave p her Cristal
Wow👏💯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
we dont care, baby z!
Why are 2 F one in the up of the cave and the dead
This is a whole nother level of emotional video’s
OMG YAY THEY MADE THE AMPERSAND
He’s adorable i’m talking about z
Imagine if he made more we can admit it would be amazing
Ë!?
clap this made my day get better than ever wow
I guess we finally know what a lowercase Z would look like
when f/F triped i heard:showdown!
Next time won’t you sing with me when?
Good final..get me cry
Z’s finna- lly happy!
Ooooooooooooo😮 p is cheating on you g
🥲 The good ending
The fact that Q is also aware of what must be done, I love his character.  He has seen all, on repeat for his entire life, he knows that his timeline will be reset by Z, and knows he has to give N the clairvoyance to aid into  his decision.  Its like "The time has come." and gives N the knowledge in order to do what's right for the sake of their world.
🌟✨️**hope and dream inserted** 🌟✨️
Alphabet lore season 2
What I saw: Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Z What I see now: Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz       Hi lowercase z
Z is really happy now than the other video of Alphabet Lore.
0:04 so we are not gonna talk about how creepy f Corpse is?
.
This is insane how Z and Q r working together to save every single letter that or Z is the only letter who cares about everything so he does something he can like for the first time in years🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
I love this ending! It's much better and we get to see lowercase Z!
Why is z upside down?
N got a Second Chance to Make things Right and he did, he is no longer the coward he once was. He was brave, he stood up to F, even if what he had done in the future was bad. Q and Z Really Twisted things around. Z rewinded time and Q Made N remember what happened. Beautiful.
Wow this cool
Omg
And historians will call them close friends
so, i have a theory. There’s still one lyric left in the alphabet song, and that’s “next time won’t you sing it with me.” since F and N walked off together, maybe there will be a sequel where F and N team up to take revenge on L and O?
Z WENT FULL ON POWER
A: dang, I wish I could've stopped it. I didn't do anything.  M: why was I even friends with those jerks?!
We finally know what do you look like when he was lowercase
I also love the fact that in the nZ part, The Ellipsis is created from Z's tears. Basically cementing the fact that the punctuation marks are in fact a constant among the letters, it is when they experience absolute pain.  Which means until the incident when they were kids, the letters never really experienced pain. And for the first time, and heartbreakingly so, F is the FIRST and ONLY letter to experienced ALL the pain in their world at the time.  And Z experienced the absolute pain of seeing everyone kill each other, creating the last punctuation.
F i N --> BEST FRIEND FOREVER
This is so adorable ngl
this is all what I needed, thanks! ;v;
Omg perfect
Omg, and we finally have the lowercase z. 😃
So is there gonna be a part 2 for this alternate ending cuz I wanna see one
Z and Q did a good job
When Everyone though F dies for real Z did something he never did before...
f & n
Why did it not end like that it was so sad with the first one
I nearly cried then.

That was the best sequel I have ever seen
Tanks is good

Horsey kids got kahooter 😱😱😱🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😳😲
as end i liker
I love how you chose the title to be "Now I now My ABCs" to show how the letters really are. This is a sequel we all truly needed. We gotta get this man to 500K and beyond! For creating the show in the first place, and later on, making another, the finale, cause he felt it was unfinished. It is over from now, but we all needed this. Thank you Mike Salcedo, thank you.
Im glad this happy ending happened.
Alphabet Lore THE GOOD ENDING
All Lores saw that
If there is a sequel, O and L would most likely be the villains Edit: it probably will have a sequel considering how many views alphabet lore gets
Perfect ending
F isn’t a villain at all! He was actually a good friend to N! L and O were the actual villains at first, but in this episode they were kinda like “Screw this! Just bring them back together! 😒” NO LETTERS ARE BAD! ALL LETTERS ARE GOOD!! 😇👍
0:23 here you go take the medicine
yesssssssssss this is the ending that i will see all is good yesssssss i love this sereis end this ending is the  bestthis all was so pervect done i really  cry at the end this is pervect i love this man that have make this serie to end the other ending was too sad man   thanks for doing this

FN❤ Hsbs s
Ending good
THIS IS SO HEART WRENCHING! I LOVE IT!! I LOVE THE HAPPY END!!!
That means.. F and N will be the villains or.. N really stopped F from being evil? It could be any of these 2. But still a very unexpected ending. I really like it!
im not crying because of letters you are
The sequel
The good ending
I just noticed "btw"
Why baby z sound like a adult
Q and Z are the true mvps here, literally made this happy ending possible.
what is the music at 0:13
I want more!!
This is great! I'm glad we could leave off on a happier ending! So N was able to travel back in time by consuming the "Question Mark" gem to make everything right, he was able to stand up for F and the two then became united. F felt loved and not neglected, so I'm guessing he didn't decide to go on an evil riot, N is now able to produce gems and is living with F, Z is happy and doesn't seem like he's on the bridge of dying, and all the other alphabets lived happily ever after without F and N. I guess I truly know my ABC's.
please part 2
Q HAD POWERS?!?!
Love this.  My headcanon to an alternative ending was that F accidentally drops P’s gem when he runs off after killing her, and it ends up in Q’s path and therefore his possession. Q makes it to the cave and is able to dodge all of F’s clones and bangs on the wall behind N, interrupting his final face off with F. Q spits out the question mark gem, there’s the flashback, and F emotionally breaks down upon seeing the traumatic events all over again. N comforts him and tries to put their friendship back in good terms. F agrees, and they unchain R, I, E, D, and S, who all form the strongest friendship in the universe.
fF
What a happy ending to alphabet lore breh amazing animation to!
I'm actually crying rn like that's such a good ending

THE HAPPY ENDING
https://youtu.be/dNWp3Nl2n84
Wtf
Cries😢😭
Dont F bad its L and O bad carectar
Since this episode was pretty hard to comprehend, I'll break it down for those confused.            The episode starts after the plot of Z, right after F's death. However, Z is uncontented with this as everyone is sad, and uses the power of the ellipsis (which he cried out when F was rejected by the community, just before the plot of A) by spinning them counter-clockwise around him.           Z goes all the way back to the flashback N had, where everyone is younger. f then trips over n, but this time n remembers the future. He looks at the letters "protecting" him, he remembers how O hurt him, he remembers how L bullied him, but then he looked at f. F never wronged him, they were broken buddies through-and-through. He looks at the ground, remembers everyone else and how they wronged him.           n, with this knowledge, decides to overpower the guilt from the other letters he felt before, and instead helps f. f is happy about this, but l and o aren't. They attack f and n, but they're happy. f and n cry out the rest of the punctuations, in a joyful, thankful way. n hugs p because p never wronged him. f and n go to F's castle, which makes the letters who rejected f and n happy. This way, every letter is content and happy in one way or another, thus making z content.  Also, in the description, Mike says that the "Epilogue" will be the final four episodes, so there is 3 episodes left. The last 3 episodes will probably do the entire ending part of the ABCs song for the names, so I believe the Epilogue episodes will be called "Now I Know My ABCs," "Next Time," "Won't You," and "Sing With Me." These episodes will probably go through the new plot of this rewound universe.
🥹🥹🥹 this is to nice for n
Wow
finaly a sequal!!!
Hear me out. N Is Z’s son... flip Z to the right what do you get?
This end make the Alphabet normal like a time because all the letters hate F and N but they will forgot about it and they will not get their revenge. So everything is back to normal and happy. But there is not anymore the lore...
Wait ist Z supossed to be an adult when they were lowercase? He is like a grandpa when they are adults so he should have been a baby when others didnt even exist
F: *falls* Also F: *dramaticaly falls* Me: LOL 😂  F talking to me through the screen :THATS IT UR DED
Damn-
C'est bien ce que je pensais. Z ne pouvait pas être là pour rien
Make Number lore
This is too wholesome
Yeah a happy end
This is the best masterpiece he ever created
Kid Z gives off the tall kid vibe
Me encanta este final Q Z WOW
Кстати я недавно смотрел все серий об этом и в конце было грустно но теперь все закончилось хорошо😂
Aa,Bb,Cc,Dr,Ee,Ff,Gg,Hh,Ii,Jj,Kk,Mm,Nn,Oo,Pp,Qq,Rr,Ss,Tt,Uu,Vv,Ww,Xx,Yy,Zz
Okay that's it the creator of alphabet Lord if you're watching this change the alphabet Lord ending right now
finally we see z lowercase
Why q ate the “?” well you see Q is for question or question mark
dude make anthoer one i need to know how it goes in the furter
Good ending
Truly an amazing finale for an amazing series, n wasn’t a coward this time, he learned from his mistake, also z had a orange young when he was lowercase? (edit: okay I realised he always had a orange toungue
True ending
f is no longer depressed
f x n confirmed
If I were to be cast away from safari I will be castaway with my best friend
Baby Z
Alphabet lore but something is off....
another beautiful work of art!! this should be a new series! the fact Z gave everyone another chance and n stopped f from becoming evil makes this so wholesome! Mike, you deserve an award🤩🤩😍😍
Good ending
Parts all Alphabet Lore
THERES MORE :D
This is the good ending :)
Absolutely magnificent ending i needed the saga is a masterpiece and giving it a good ending its just to great
yay
Bruh it is so cringe but so sad
What was Z doing? Or should i say wat de Z doin?
YESSSSS
I am sad and disappointed The original ending was so much better and this vanilla go back in time so everyone is happy BS The new ending just feels forced in my opinion 👎😞
Alphabet lore best friends,😭
YES!!!!!!!!!
Wow beast ending
Cooll
We finally know what the ... does [Edit: Nobody: Mike Salcedo subs when he posted this video https://youtu.be/Jvmmkx1dtmA ]  [Another Edit we know more about what the ? does]  [Edit 3 we also saw lowercase z for the first and only time, shocking all of the alphabet lore rp community on roblox]  [Edit 4 I committed 😭]  [Edit 5 I found a sad p]
What a happy ending!
z sounds like uppercase Z
lowercase z
1st place: Q, HE IS AN UNSTOPPABLE BEING, BEING GOD OF Z.  2nd place: Z ehhh 3rd place: he only killed 1 person :/
Just wait a minute... WHY DID HE UPLOAD THIS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE HE DONT UPLOAD NOW THIS!?!?!?!?
Siiiiiiiiii f por ti n
What I think happened: Z used the tears to rewind time, and Q gave N his stone so he could be aware of what was going to happen to F. So N, decided to fix his wrongs and the alphabet lore now has a happy ending. Now Z is no longer sad and everyone’s happy. One of the best stories I’ve ever seen.
This makes me so happy
F.
Continuação please
i refuse to believe that this isn’t a fanmade animation because it kinda does look like it
LETS GOOOOO F AND N ARE FRIENDS AGAINNNNNNNNN!!!
Dude This is not Alphabet lore, this is Alphabet Story.
I just got one question: how do letters spell words with more than one of a letter?
Real lowercase Z
ten
1 trillon out of trn
0:18 (By the way)
i have guessing that Z is Broken Cause He is Sad And HeartBroken.Becuase The Normal Story Happened.(without the Epiligoue)now Z is happy.       And Q gived N the ? power,that N can remember what happened to other letters when they are older. So,Q and Z Teamed Up.
baby z is the best
Great ending! If this is the ending for sure, can you think about making a number lore??
Наконец-то появился этот продолжение и я счастлив что все получили хорошую концовку ты лучший Майк обожаю🧡🖤
Part 2?
Number Lore by Mike Sacked prediction: After the letters all died out, numbers began to thrive. 666 and his army start invading the planet infinity and send 6 to help him. 6 took care of the numbers until finally being defeated by 13.

Good Episode

#mikesalcedo
I am sad now because of the end
I literally just cried😭 cuz its so cute and sad
Alphabet: The Finale - Alphabet Lore P and X died in cementery killed them
I honestly wasn’t expecting an epilogue with the way the Alphabet Lore “ended” last time. Safe to say, I loved this epilogue with more happiness than I can express in these simple words. It was such an amazing surprise when I saw this in my for you page. This wrapped up N’s character development gave F a happy ending and, is the ending we all needed but, never expected
#alphabet
omg
omg! this is so good!
they are cute i love this animations

Survivors: G,M,Y,U,V,A,Q,N Sacrifice: R,I,E,D,S. Bullies: L,F,O
This is INCREDIBLE f and n reconcile is absolutely beautiful only thing I’d wish is that all the letters stood up to L and O but either was it’s incredible
make one of numbers
A good ending!!!! :)
1:55 yay is so sad
#alphabetlore
The good ending
its like the secret ending you get when you complet 100% in a game, but better.
now my man did upload
that  made me cry
I love it It gives a nice ending to Alphabet lore
Wow this I was just wasnt expecting this but it happend Good ending!
MASTERPEICE WE ALL NEEDDED THIS ENDING
Round off applause i new f didn’t do anything
i love how m is just like "how did i end up with these bastrads"
Good ending 🤔
How nice
Z reset the fucking universe making, N dont make his mistakes on this new reality and they become FRIENDS at the end making a new universe were F is not bad
GENIAL
I know, at some point, deep in the future, maybe even in a new universe we'll get a new version of alphabet lore.
i never known as the new one Good one! 😄👍
AWWWWWWW ❤❤❤
Perfect
Can we get a under-case series when the video happened
I think we're still missing next time won't you sing with me we're L And O are punished and everyone else apologies to F
@Gabby16bit
I like how N was able to get the courage to stand up for himself this time than being a “ coward “ hiding away. Q gave the ? to N because than if it was Q he would be too slow and it would repeat. This ending was great even though N, F will probably never show their face’s again to the other alphabet’s again. At least they have each other as “ friends “
Cute z I just wanna cuddle him
Bro we need to add the numbers and symbols in this your the best at these
the ; and ? made an AMPERSAND (&) !!
#ISTHEREGONNABENEXTTIMEWONTYOUSINGWITHME?
A masterpiece pin me?
This is the best
❤This is the best thing I’ve ever seen and the z is the cutest❤
Numbers lore please
🥲 good
i ment f bomb
Awwwww
Story: about to end probably because f is dead Q: I'm about to do something called a pro gamer move
"Give a little kissim" P said at n & g.
NEXT TIME WON’T YOU SING WITH MEEEEEEEE
Yessss we needed this
Good ending
They turned the sad ending into a happy ending! And we finnaly could see lowercase Z!
I CAN'T HOLD ANY LONGER T-TOO MUCH CUTENESS-
bro f can stand for the d bomb but it can also stand for friends
awe z is so happy :)
This is better than the Mona Lisa
I like how they never saved H rude
Reverse psychology…
Bro this is better than marvel wth XD
When B, T and W looked up, they spelled BTW, wich means "by the way"
12 Hours ago. 1,3M VIEWS?! HOW?!
Never would I think that Mike would spend all that time to make an alternate ending. I wonder if he’s ever gonna confirm which one is the “true” ending
Bro you better continue the alphabet lore
I thought this was coming. Z made tears of …, and in that video, everyone and everything matters. Though I find it weird for that being a clue for a sequel when a sequel wasn’t planned.
That was a beautiful ending I wounder if we would have a alternative timeline
BABY Z
N is a baby Mike
GENIUS
🥹
why do I now want a fight scene with f & n vs l & o
Is a same One
1:58 z
Wow I can't believe I completed the whole movie okay time to make a movie out of it
We need F and N being evil
Z just re-did the entire ending of this series, talk about god status
I like how even lowercase z has a deep voice, implying that he is much older than all of the other letters combined.
Seeing Z as a baby is so adorable ngl.
They finaly add z and the good ending
F is not bad
Well more people are now gonna ship N and F together because of this- thanks Mike salcedo
IM SO IMPRESSED🥰
The true ending.
YOO TOP MOST EPIC ANIMES SCENES IN STORY XD
Fn : FortNight
this man needs a reward for this absolute masterpiece
That was amazing and the animetion 1000000000000/10
:)
"Next time won't you sing with me."
lowercase Z is cute
they needa hire this guy for storyboarding for a movie company
Will there be more?
You can now play as Luigi.
Ok but what if the smae thing happens except f and n dies
When r and s did nothing but f still hates them*
*sniff sniff* THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
Friendship rulex :D
Now they can be villians together
wholesome ending
Next time, won't you sing with me?
POR QUÉ LLOROOOOOOOOO
Alphabet Lore Part 2?
The last one was good but this one… I love how z likes travels back True time then f and n became best friends:)
Z Thank You So Much!

N and f Friends to the end.
Good ending
Pls make more of this stuff
🙂👍
D- did you reall- really made this? I thought it was fanmade!
YAAAAAA friends:D
Ñ and CH?
BABY Z HAS BEEN REVEAL.
This made me happy
¿ new chapter 2 ?
F
Now we just have to wait for “the number lore”
We gonna ave epilogue pt 2
Alphabet lore good ending
😭😃😇🥳
All F really Needed was genuine friendship Also, I made it a part of my headcanon that the ellipsis could manipulate time, then come to find out, that's canon
Now all we need is next time won’t you sing with me where all adult letters sing their role in the abc song
The ending we needed but never expected
The ellipses had the power to rewind time! Incredible finale!
They revealed z's baby form, yay. Now I know if z is lava when baby
👍👍😀FN
This is the most good ending ever
You should make a number lore👀
FINALLY WE GET JUSTICE FOR F
Q’s a chad and so is Z
Is no one going to point out that P made a pog face at 1:41?
Lowercase Z revealed!
Now I want the sequel of the epilogue!
this ending was beautiful...
good ending:
liked it part3
Yay
WWWWWOOOWWWWW SO COOL
0:31 nf 1:59 z
The face of f that made me go crazy with laughter 1:17
This is a happy ending wow
Won't you sing along with me?
LOWERCASE Z!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The real ending
I love it but now people  are shipping F and N but I'm also traumatized because  of that ship
Do number lore now plssssss i will subscribe and also like all ur videos
now do number lore
Happy ending😊
Pls do number lore plssss
Everyone talking about Z  but nobody giving credit to Q for giving N the ?
can we have another part to see changes
No one letter is better or worse than the other, they are all equal parts that come together to make something bigger, a mountain, a story, but most importantly, a friendship.
La historia de la f y cuando una una minúscula la nsl cuidando y está felices para siempre de felices para más y fin de videos de alphabet lore video de la

Best video ever
I wish that’s how alphabet lore ended
YES ITS HERE
Wow
Omg the continued
&
1:49 one kiss is all it takes
I absolutely loved how N went to the past again.
0:18 BTW          By the way
We need alphabet lore on a different planet like insted of Z a diff letter whit nee letters
Now follow Number Lore
"And nothing of value was lost."
OMG THIS IS CUTE i don't love the oereganl ending I LOVE THIS ENDIG
NGL, it looks like the good ending
2:03 mine z
Got me tearin
1010101010101010/10
A good edimg
I wonder where is W because W was only in N’s thoughts
The true ending is here
now that will effect the future and N and F will not get revenge on the other letters, but only O and L.
😭😭😭😭sad
Baby z is soooooo cute
Who says it's a good ending n and f could get mad and even more powerful then kill every alphabet letter
this is sick
Wait so I have a question   So are the letters ( D E I J P C S R ) still dead in the future or does this start a new timeline where F is a good guy?
"Gay fun" hmm I think the thumbnail wants to tell us something, but I don't know what
We have been waiting for the sequel to release then that’s all folks 😊
The good ending
Wow, THIS turned out of a joke, THIS!! I'm stunned! Great job! Sad it's over but glad we got the ending we needed.
Just saying,  There was a missed opportunity to say "Fin" by making I come in too and join
THE GOOD ENDING..
The F is still dead?
Epik.
Wait this is the end? I wanted to see another part but it was fun while it lasted tho
GOOD ENDING
I thought the alphabet lore should have ended sad, like a lesson to never judge people by one mistake.
A GOOD ENDING!!! :D
THIS ALMOST MADE ME CRY! ITS SUPER CUTE
WE FINALLY SEE z (baby Z
YOOOO ANITHER ALPHABET LORE VIDEO???? I'M SO HAPPY
I really want there to be the removed letters in alphabet lure like oth Ethel and ash
What about the prologue
Lower case z is very cute  If you agree 👇
Are you going to make more of the alphabet Lore please
Epic ending 👍👍👌
Yes
I'm crying of happiness ;)
What's the name of the musics? They are really good.
Finally we got the ending we all deserved
I guess now we have a lowercase Z
A comunidade infantil arruinou alfabeto lore
I Love you f TwT
Soo cool end n is soo nice and f funny
My heart T_T tysm for this awesome ending
This is just so heartbreaking ❤️‍🩹, you really deserve a Oscar for this🎉
At least now in exile F will no longer be alone. That's what really matters. Thank you, Z, for giving not only N a second chance, but us, the audience, a second chance as well. I now know my ABCs; hope next time you'll sing with me.
Z is the planet now I realize
👍👍👍👌Good
Now that’s what I call a happy ending😊
the happy seems at fun :D
It is the part 2!
I really thought that Z was an old N XD
The good ending
Omg is that "z" at kid
Z as a baby wow!
Is what happened after the series cuz this is amazing and if lankybox wacths it they will be shook
imagine how cool the guy made a bad ending of the story
Woah😊
I'm not gonna lie, this ending is kind of lame, everything we've seen so far was just thrown out the window, the thing is this story didn't have to end with a happy ending. The letters relized it was their fault their friends died, that's how it should have ended.
YES A NEW ALPHABET LORE
I Love f
So is everyone alive and happy now? Or is N Evil with F? Also this feels like a new island trailer for MSM
The good ending
Going through it was very good of 🕘 I had
wow
good ending: n was friends with f afterall
Yayyyy
QQQQQQQQQQ   n gulp
This made me tear up! This is a masterpiece! I love it!
.. I knew the first part of the endings would  happen after the flash back. The question mark would drop and they realized F is a good guy. But I didn’t expect the time reversal and the reveal of baby Z
So f doesn't die YAY
I wonder what if it be like after they grown up. f and n is Friends and things change. Now we know what z looks like when he was a kid. Nice
The ending we never asked for, but we got anyway becouse the creators are amazing
where's next time won't you sing with me
Before a million
0:15 force shied
this is so amazing i almost cried
Now we need a recap what would’ve happened the whole time if this is how it went down lmao
Esto no es algo hermoso es algo perfecto es una obra de arte es lo más bonito y sentimental que e visto en toda mi vida
so what happends after,did N and F get revenge or F is good now and is gonna play with the others
Z REVENGES
MORE ALPHABET LORE PLS 🙏 😢 😭 😫 😔
just cringe
🥹
Lowercase Z!!!!!
I love how Z and Q tried to change the tragic events, and how n decided to stick up for himself and change the ending. Truly Z, Q, and n deserve a round of applause.
Even z likes the ending
0:41 that smooth af shake before he talks
The good ending
Good job man, you're so good!.
z has the power to reverse time?
am so glad part to is finaly out
Now all we need is: Next time won’t you sing with me
Now that's a good ending

Z got telekinesis now?
I'm so proud of n and f 😢
Siiii por fin
It’s Z
Update it and also what about numbers and shapes they have to be connected what about the rest of the stones and what's up with the Planet Z
I wish this was something on Netflix, a full completed season
YESS THIS IS SOOO COOL!!
He should do one but with symbols like Star of David and divide and the bad guy is swastika
Good ending
Pov your n: my life is better with f
This is one heck of an animation these are the reasons why I liked this lore. 1: Has a good story 2: Has redemption for F and N. 3: Clean animation. 4: Bunch of references from different animations like sailor moon.
Mekuto
And the Z is happy
The best ending I was about to cry about this
MORE! MORE ALPHABET LORE! I NEED IT!
N is wholesome
I wish this was a show with no violence
I just want justice for F and extreme pain for O and L
Part 3 Is Next Time wont you sing with me
The final
This is wholesome. Random guy on internet:FxN!!!!
AMAZING!
I legit almost cried seing this🥺
All needed that, just amazing.
This might B too much work for you, but what if U decided to make the alternate alphabet lore ending?
This is a nice ending And I like z at the end

Why do z is have 2 one to two eye
:
Its amizing
respect
Lezz go good ending and lowercase z lezzzzzz go  i love this best thing i ever saw

So z reversed time to make everything goos
I think having this ending use a flash forward like nZ did could expand what happens in the future.
I was thinking  it would be a 2nd series
we did it bois, we got the good ending
alphabet lore part 2
🥰
black orange🤨
The finale was perfect, N not going with the bad letters and staying with F, and Q giving the  "?" power for N to remember the good things of P and F, and on top Z with the "..."  power to made everything back in time and fix everything, it was amazing
Bro the ending was just perfect i love this series and everyone is finally happy

This is the good ending
All we need now is “next time won’t you sing with me”
Now we need next time won't you sing with me.

God endid
I did not expect this. Dear god where do I even begin. I never expected this to come but but I'm so glad it did, I love this so damn much 😭😭😭✨✨✨ Glad to hear Z managed to reverse things, and make a happy ending instead of watching everything happen. Give this man the highest possible award that exists. 🫡
Porque se ve tan real

"Next time won't you sing with me?"

if we get another part it should be the adult versions of them but with the good timeline
If you could made another ending of f being revived then I would be happy
z IT IS THE WORLD
and also. YESSIR
We all thought Z was just there in the end but then Z did something we all wanted
Oh thats lil z then
Q is the hero and N. Q has telekinesis and he gave N the.  ? N and Q are God's with Z F wanted revenge in the uppercase story, or he just wanted to spell F R I E N D S
We've waited a month for an epic masterpiece

There should be a second epilogue “next time wont you sing with me” where its them as an adult in this timeline  Now what will you do?
n sounds like a girl when he says n
The perfect ending to the already perfect series 👍 Can someone get this guy a beer?
hoolllly crap i thought we were never getting more :D :D :D  edit: ok i watched it a few more times and uh.... Q has telekenesis, canonically. wow.  edit 2: i like how at 1:28, Mike kept the detail of them getting thrown into looking like their adult versions from the original nZ. Great job!  edit 3: just realized ; + ? = & :o (1:32)  edit 4: happy 500k mike!
YESSSSSSS I LOVE THIS ENDING

wait….. WAIT….  SO IF EVERY ALPHABET LORE LETTER IS NAMED AFTER A EPISODE THIS IS “now I know my abcs” NOW WE NEED “Next time won’t you sing with me”
Okay but like why does a part of me want a "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me" like a prologue of something else or something
Yayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayaayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayaayayyaayayayayayayayayayayayayay. Y A Y
The past was rewritten F is no longer alone
The best part was when the ? And the ; made a &
so is this the prequel to keyboard lore? Please make that
The next episode will probably be called Next Time Won't You Sing With Me.
We saw z!
RESPECT of the alphabet

Good end

This just made Alphabet lore 20x happier, I don't know if I like it with this ending or of I liked the Shakespeare style tragedy we had before this.
This is the most wholesome sequel to a end of the lore in history ;U;   This fucking GLORIOUS
This was perfect
And so, from now on, my alphabet will just be F and N.
IS THAT A NEW LITTLECASE Z?
there is gonna be a "next time wont you sing with me..." which may show what happened after this
yes z
This makes my heart melt 💞
My Xbox account watched this when it was at 30k. This ending is heartwarming and I love it :)
Truly the movie of the century

This was the most emotional video I have ever seen...  Even if some of us doesn't admit it, almost everyone nearly cried to this amazing and friendship-filled animation, and no one would have ever saw this masterpiece without you Mike Salcedo.  Thank you very much for this happy and emotional ending.

The true origin of baby Z

0:11  Z : *It's rewind time* 😎
Happy ending

1:50 dont mind me
This is insane! (Btw i think u can notice his editing chanced)

A happy ending, now the last part
F and N  FN  FORTNITE
Oh welp, cant wait for N x F ships
Somehow I predicted time travel just not in the way I thought
This revived my Cold dead heart! ❤
🥲😇
And it all ended with a good ending as always
Yessir
the good ending
So technically F is becoming a dad for N
The true ending :)
wait this is officia!
I was waiting for this justice ending lol
This is cool and all but I still can’t get over the placement of A, G, and Y in the beginning scene.
YASSS
I love it
f's face 1:16
I don’t understand what are this gem things the cried out and what’s the whole story can someone explain
Oh my...
Closure brings such overwhelming relief
F & N are friends now! Yay!! But i watched the 15 minute video (the og)
The good ending
1:23 *if we go down, we go down together.*
Z is the protagonist
Love your animations! ❤
Hey, *at least we actually got baby Z* jk, if I’m being honest, I actually love this ending, F in the end doesn’t kill everybody and N stands up to him, even though he got beat up. And the best part is, they actually got a happy outcome. *I hope they make future stuff like this, because this is amazing.*
Alphabet Lore: The Good Ending
This Is The Good Ending

HAPPY LIFE❤
That was so cute I wish there was a true ending of o and l doesn't bullies n and f o and l would like not exist just nice version of them we saw the bad ending and the good ending and they would live happily ever after
😢
the official Z baby
(the end) : z was so cute when he was lowercase
This guy needs 1 million subscribers he deserves it for touching our hearts and these animations
Is a nice happy ending
We need a season2
WHEN WE ZOOMED OUT AND SAW ADULT Z I SAW F
¿it's canon?
Z is going to sleep for another 1,000 years
Don't forget about the 10 removed letters from the alphabet!
The number lore is next
i saw this on a differnt video nowfeel bad becuse i should of saw this on yours heck that other video that i watched becuse i should of saw the original becuse i thoght that that ending was fake but it was real
Mike Salceldo, Can you make Alphabet Lore 2?
1:32 wait ussr reference?
I'M BURSTING AT THE SEAMS THIS IS SO CUTE
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y nZ  NOW I KNOW MY ABC   Next time won't you sing with me
I Love the Way z have the power And so alfabet Lore 2 comes with New leters like Spanish ñ And russan leters like шщф
You know I kinda thought o and l would come in and n finds out they started it and there would be an epic final battle and they would some how revive all the dead letters and f would be ns friend again and they would line up into FRIENDS just like in the z video 🤔
Ffffffffffff did nothing wrong
AWWWWW IM GONNA CRY F LIVES YAYYYYYYYYYY
Aw well what a happy ending  F and n are still friends
Happy ending
all because the letters expect for n
I love this
the true ending
we finally knew what z looked liked (lowercase z)
If you make number lore, 6 and 9 have to be friends, 7 has to eat 9, and that should make 6 afraid of 7.
I like Zs lowercase form he looks like *Pluto*
Damn
Aww
This is amazing a cannon ending that’s high quality is what I love
Of Part 1 of 500
Best ending ever
Just a way more better ending I am being honest.
;? = Friends
I thought this was fake but then I realised it was real when I double checked this was wholesome and emotional 😢good vid
Plot twist: now both N and F will start kiling other letters
Woow
aww lowercase z is so cute
Op
Hey I'm supposed be coming back I'm + remember?
finaly a good ending :)
WE GOT THE REAL BABY Z
it should be in the movie theaters by now
next time wont you sing with me?
Que lindo
The fast kiss of P had me death💀
We all have to comment a "f n" right now!
I was thinking this woukd be some dystopian ending, but for once my sadistic soul is internally bawling
What about the uppercase good ending
I litreally cryed at this point of emotions but this is the happiest ending of my life!
It’s beautiful the ending was so good 🎉
BRO THIS GOT ME SAD AND HAPPY IN SIDE
N: Oh. that's saddening Y: F's dead, though. Z: It's time to go to sleep. K: What the.. L: Whoa! B: What? Q: Oh crap, Everything's freezing! Quick! Take this! Revert f: Whoa! n: Wha? o.. l.. f.. coward..? I'm gonna do it! I'm not gonna let any G, l, o get past me! n: f, it's me! f: n..? you're sytill on my side? Awwww... l: No matter, time to finish this! o: Roger! f: So glad we're on good terms now. n: thank you! c'mon, let's go. g: Whoa! n: Thank you so much for going by me! p: Thank you! (kiss) f: Let's go. z: and they lived happily ever after.
Que lindo omg ❤❤❤😭😭
The friendship between F and N is restored. Thank you Z and Q for the help and the perfect sequel as well
Can we please have a number lore like 1_10 please that would be awesome

😀
My god I’m crying
1:58 baby z

I wonder what the alphabet will be like now.
i nearly cried on how wholesome this is
You make good animates can you do a number lore
Peaceful at last
We’ll, unexpected but cool!
I think this can’t be the end like a Sequel like a new villain and all the letters would try to stop the new villain and if F helping it would be an amazing sequel
The good ending
Yo
Finaly the ending :)
Z be like: it's rewind time
FINALY z

역시 해피엔딩이 짱이야!!
I feel bad for F R I E D S
1:31 AMPERSAND
LOWER CASE z
😩😩😩😩😩 ;( so make me sad
LOWERCASE Z IS HERE!!!
Wow 1 million in a day
LES GO 11,377TH
I thought z was a lava plantet but it wasent
Wait if this episode is "Now i know my ABC's Is there gonna be another episode called "Next time won't you sing with me!"
Why Is z Bigger Than Z
There is a true ending of alphabet lore?
Will the bot respond?
What a happy ending!
The good ending
Is F still alive
Thanks you for making this
Cool *now number lore.*
Part three now
wonder where z scales to
I am the first person to see this video
" *_The Good Ending_* "
Now we can all rest in peace.
Bro went back in time and faced his fears and changed the course of reality for the better permenantly
Great now give us 52 more episode's
All the puntuation marks and they owner N: ; semi clonilon M: , comma O: . Full stop P:! Clolion Q: ? Question mark X : * abstract Z: ... continue speech
Seeing this makes me tear up. Since n went back in time, he fixed the mistake and grew up with f as his friend.        This is a thought.
The Good Ending we needed  Btw: It was a Jojo Reference?
The Good ending 🥲
So BEAUTIFUL
Alphabet lore 10/10
Hwje
Hdjd
1:50 funny 🤣🤣 JUST LOOK
we needed this
Now we wait until next time won’t you sing with me😂
Topper what the fuck shit they edited it
Makes sense for q to have the ? Cause question starts with Q
Epic
F wasn't trying to be a monster he was just alone for a long time😭😭😭
Now I say I say I wasn’t gonna be a fan of time rewinds anymore but I swear oh swear this is an exception!   Also does this mean in the future F and N are gonna start beating L and O’s ass??
Finally: lowercase z
Thanks for part 2 :D
The Unique is the ? power Can time traveling
This automatically makes Z one of the best characters.
Cool, but then what? Do N and F just isolate themselves from the others forever?
NOW THIS IS A GREAT ENDING!!
When f and n become friends: Shippers: I have been summoned
You make one what if N and F be Friends forever
Happy ending! 😃
N FIXED EVERYTHING YAY
This almost made me cry lol
Maybe they could do a ‘Next time won’t you sing with me’ and add the aftermath of the happy ending
Out of everyone P still gets to keep the exclamation mark  :>
If we get a Season 2, We should have the Number Lore, New Guys like Â, Ś, Ë, Ç, and More. Congrats Z and Q for making the Alphabet Lore a Happier Place.
Ah so that’s why my keyboard has an fn key
Siiii nuevo video de alphabet lore

0:11 Hey, it’s rewind time :)
F and N is very good

Wut why more + why wasn't e silent and more details that would've been nice
Nice​
Make a life of n and f togheter
Also I'm using my dad's phone
The ending we needed but didn’t deserve
Ok if any one thinks that f is still gonna be a maniac nope your wrong 1: n and f are together so the betrayal timeline is unchained so it has disconnected or deleted 2:and that's it 3: BONUS EPILOGUE they will join the alphabet again K that's all
Mike Salcedo, You did a great job making this happy ending! 😊 You earned yourself a sub

This was so great, I can’t wait to see how YouTube ruins this.
Lowercase Z
That was cute 🥺
My fav animation by far.
Yoo
Yess i thought only a fan would do a fanmade video of this
your animations are cool but i continue felting when peoples think letter m is a little useless (a little no i think peoples REALLY think m is useless and i am a bit sad for m)
i dropped a tear
:D              That’s all I have to say
Finally at long last.. I know my abc’s !!
🤯 amazing 👏
Alphabet lore is F good
I like when Z comes
I thank God that he gave you the power to create this finalle.  I am a believer and I will be better from now and on even if there is no "N" on my side.... I should consider helping others in need than being bitter about any friend I have ever lost.  This came just in time. Like a miracle to me.
Baby z?
next is a bad ending where F achieves his goal and kills everyone else
And what would have happened if N had chickened out?
alphabets rp: yo new characters dropped
THIS IS A GOOD ENDING PLS ADD IT TO ALPHABET LORE ORIGINAL VIDEO
It was funny but it was great and good
Wow what a happy ending :)

Fun facts about alphabet lore The song that was playing when they're kids What's twinkle twinkle little stars
Thanks to the Z that he would wind a time back to the beginning and end felt like he was actually brave enough to go through all those letters I’m so glad they got the happy ending I can’t wait for more brilliant videos that you make!
f X n
But why was z so sad
The simplest thing, is the most enjoyable things in the universe.
This is so sweet
YESSSS
lemme guess, next time come and sing with me is next
“Every story has a good ending” -Dr.Seuss
now all we need is a season 2 AND other alternate endings...
BAD ENDING: NO MORE F MEMES
Why is no one talking about how n thanked p when P Calmed N down in pt.1
At first I thought this was fake but after I saw it was by Mike Salcedo I knew it was real
Now we need what changed in the future in that alternative ending
How the fuck can a letter make me cry ?
Finally lowercase Z
Z is so cute
so thats what baby z looks like
The lowercase Z looks linda cute
So I think z made everyone go back in time so that they can see f again
AH YES FINALLY THE FINAL I WATCHED ALL ALPHABER LORE

1:50 p kisses n
The real question is WHAT HAPPENED TO W???
that's so cu t <:)
the good ending z make everyone go back in time before Q gies N  the stone to stopanything badof happening
I think the normal Z looks broken because he is sad after they bullied f but now in the alternate ending he is happy (I know he is lowercase)
I think as M/m as N/n brother which took me by surprise that he didn’t give him a stone
This man went from like 28k to 480k in 2 months
<:)
now make number lore
Z...
Good ending
so from f  dying to z rewinding and then f and n get married?  my brain hurts

I'd love to see what happens next with this, if something does happen next, which could happen because this series is the best I've ever seen!
Pls one more part I want to know what happens in this timeline future
Pls just make a better part 2 sequal
Totally need this! 😁
Finally,the good ending
yay wholesome ending!
I LOVE THIS ENDING
Z is so cooler than the best way to get a new job
This implies that there's still a "next time won't you sing with me" left over
The funny part is where the blue thing that Z makes,then you just hear  "K" that came out of nowhere.
Yesssssss
*TRUE ENDING UNLOCKED*
Good ending ❤
Now make alphabet lore finale part 2
Niceeeee
I LOVE THIS. AAAAAAH. 😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖 F and N have the BEST FRIENDSHIP.  Thank you for this epilogue. You gave Z the perfect role (for someone in his position). 😢😢😢😢❤💙💚💜
Yessssssss finally
Z is so cool
Now all we need is credits showing stuff that happened as a result of this.
:D
So when n and f showed their tears and they collided and went in them did n show f the future and how it would of went. Also that means n is in an alternate universe.
LoL
Truly the true final ending
wow   Whe added Z Lowercase
... .... perfect.
WHY EVERYONE IS CRYING ON THE THIS VIDEO?
It is a bit weird that Q force fed the question mark gem to N.
Imagine if the earth did this and ended pollution lol
Yay an happy ending
Can't wait for dumb youtubers to milk this
YES HAPPY ENDING!!!!
Z be like:MADE IN HEAVEN!!!
Z at start:sad  At the end: HAPPY
At the end was that baby Z
o cool we get to see young z
Such a happy ending ❤
This is the best best best best animation in the entire universe.I really enjoyed this and i literally cried for 20 minutes. When i grow up, ill still remember this fantastic animation. You just made me feel my childhoods again.😭😁😁😭
z looks so cute
And before you know it,ships will be going around.
Who is crying tears of joy that it’s a happy ending 👇
this is awsome
alternate tittle: what if the "þ" episode really existed.
Ñ: why am i not a character and just a dumb form that has 10 secondsof screentime!? Thorn: i dont exist
As seen throughout the series, he was trying to form the word "FRIENDS". He did that pretty easily with the only letters that actually were stopping him being P, L, G, M, C and N in the end. In the episode "Y" he managed to capture almost all the letters and was missing only one - N when he was arriving to him he removed all the threats (A, G, U and M) but he abandoned all the gems except the * gem and N collected them he didn't attack N thinking it would realize what he is trying to do, but N used the power of his gems killing him.
We finally got to see why Z and the good ending
Everyone: what a beautiful ending Me: hehehe gay in the thumb
Im about to cry-
And so, N and F joined forces with T and went on to screenshot everyone's NFTs, and they lived happily ever after. The end.
Almost made me cry 😊
But that’s the bad thing. Since ‘n’ and ‘f’ became united, all the others will go against N and F when they all are grown up, and P will end up killing her best friend. There’s always one person who has to be the main character. The one who suffers. In every dimension. In every reality. Every storyline will always have the main character do the worst in any way. Even if F never existed, N would become evil. If neither of them existed, L and O would become evil. If nobody existed, Z would make the world come crashing down. So they never changed anything. There was never no hope.
0:24 Q does magic
I'm going to cry rn
You are number 1 💪😎
Good ending?!?
NOW WE NEED AN POST EPILOGUE THAT SHOWS THE OTHER LETTERS (maybe recept for L and O) *FORGIVE F AND N.* Because though this is a better ending than the last one, I still think they both deserve even BETTER. 😉😉🤗🤗💟❣💟❣
That is back in time
Will it be interesting to continue?
❤️‍🔥
This is better than endgame

Im doing a reaction vid
This looks cool
i thinked the lore was ended the sadest way possible and my tears got hurt but THIS IS THE MOST HAPPY ENDING
That ending was the best! And it still introduces us to the Z child! Mike Sacedo thanks for the ending!
I love it! I was wondering if we could get a Number Lore?
I love how P just gived a small kiss to N
Now I wonder what Next Time Wont You SIng With Me is going to be.
LOWERCASE Z !!!!!111!!!1!1!1
10 K 10 K
We need to see what happened after this.
BABEH ZED
I am truly glad that the epilogue gave a happy ending to F.    But does this really fix everything?    Now n is an outcast alongside f, I suppose they have eachother but will this stop F from seeking revenge on all the letters that beated him up? Will N like, soften him up into somewhat forgiving them? Will they team up to beat them all up?   My biggest gripe is than F never goes after L and O they are the ones he should have wiped clean off of the top of Z, not J, T or X. They are the ones that started all this and they are never called out by the other letters or pay for what they did.   Also the Marks of Power come from tears in general, by the interaction between two letters, or by a certain feeling that they cannot verbally express?    I am at least glad f is happy now.
Cool man will come soon?
this is when real men cry
best friend forever ending                                                                                                                                                                                                    after all we have know about z power , giorno refrenece

Darn the fact that n and f became friends again because of z is cute!

10/10. I'd love to see some more alphabet lore content! (the story is so good and I'd love if you could make like a sequel to this! you dont have to tho)
God, how i love the happy ending!
Z: that is why i was crying.
Why does q look like he's going to do the uchiha massacre all over again in the thumbnail
So heart warming
More More Alphabet lore
Can you make an official number lore

YES
For mike: It’s not done just YET. We need a *musical* called *Next Time won’t You Sing with Me*
I found a mistake I say f on the top of the f cave even know he is dead💀 when I pause it 0:10 pauses it quick or slow it down
And also thank you for showing K with asthma lol
Mike:So when do I get to take down the other video so I can replace it?  Algorithm: That's the neat thing, you dont
I'm I the only one. Who thought kid Z was doing the ah* gh* face. Plus I hate kid z. He should be the same but looks like a young adult. Kid Z destroyed the fact he's a planet.
Wow
It all makes sense now with a happy ending

Finally you made real happy ending..
Good ending almost cried
WHAT A HAPPY ENDING! AAAH, WHAT A HAPPY ENDING! Or is it more a beginning? OOH! Does this mean the secondary epilogue is gonna be the entire series redone to fit the GOOD ending of the lore?!

we didn't deserve this, but we got it anyways
N:Now I know my ABCs              So i must fix them
Wow
i like how little z sleeps at the end
Alphabet Lore is one of the best series in years even though the only communication is G's morse code and the alphabet sounds, kind of a shame this got ruined by the children community, but i wont dwell on that.
YES FINALLY THANKS A LOT THATS THE ENDING THAT I LOVE
If you love z say Z here Z IS OUR SAViOR and N
I'm confused did z explode or reverse time
this is so COOL!
Huh       Neat
Z:WITH THE POWER OF Z
Now i can rest peacefully
Ima be honest, but Baby Z is actually adorable 😔
Noooo the finale nooo part 3 Plz :(
I was wondering why this was so smooth but then I realized we gave you a whole september to work on it
Hopefully we get a sequel

I-i-i-i-i don’t know what to say
Z has finally save the day
I need to tell something what do the letters do with l and o?
I'm not satisfied yet, I NEED MORE XD, i need a post post ending where n says everyone the future and l and o are the bad but not exiling them because otherwise the same thing would be repeated only with L and O
Z and N are a hero
n❤️f
N earned my respect
Wait why don’t u do a video that how it is now in uppercase?
Ending 2/Alternate Ending:
Together the history remade it self. Expect the n is on the f’s side
This is the most epic animation I have seen

I love alphabet lore NOW
1:07 lowercase J is smiling for some reason
I did not expect this ending
The ending we needed, the ending they predicted.

There must be ankther part when they grow up and still be friendly
There's always a good ending to a problem but I wonder what happens in the future when there all uppercase did f change in any way?
Comment if u hate it and like if you love it
Im happy you too?
The End: Uppercase Z Lowercase z
To all the people who tried to make Z as a kid well here you have it 2:01

That was a cute story of n and f it was really a cute stoooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyy!
This is making me excited
This Is Not The Real Alphabet, It's Not A Movie, But Q Had Literally His Life Kid To Adult Walking Slow, Trying To Tell His Friends What They Did, F Had Not A Sad Story Like Q
*2:03* everyone must fight to protect this smile
the best
We need more
I'm wondering? What will the future be? Will F and N be the "Evil" people or not? And technically speaking, the timeline would lead to a paradox, and in the Good ending, N and Z would have no incentive to go back in time to fix things up. Sooo... what now?
F n friend☺
Now we know what Z look like as a baby
And now we dont need to worry about z ! :D
Honestly, this was the perfect epilogue, Z said “It’s Rewind Time” and made N stand up for himself, and got to F (This is better than any anime death scene)
I love this 😊❤
z but bebe
Such a sweet ending awww
2:03 the lowercase Z...
The good ending
this is why i love Q
Imagen seeing l and o getting beaten up and everyone knows that f accidentally spelled "frick"
At the end they look so adorable
gah dam i didn't expect a epilogue of this, this is so cool
Dudu that so GOOD (:
YES N AND F GOT ANGONG IDK HOW TO SPLL
Now we have to wait for Number Lore
Yeeees lowercase Z
One of the best animations I've ever seen! Needs an award, better than the main base
Awww thats cute they turns back as friends❤❤❤(also pls do numbers lore)
o
Omgggggg i love him
"Ah... What a good end! ...and... Now what?" -Sr Pelo

There's no way I just cried to a simple animation of the alphabet.  Seriously, i actually cried. This ending is too beautiful.
The ellipses real power is changing back time
Can’t wait for “next time won’t you sing with me” (prob not going to come)
"Next time won't you sing with me", maybe?
O , l, and m are the real villains of the story

1:41

🥲🥲🥲
YES FINALLY WE GOT THE BEST ENDING OF THE ALPHABET LORE AND GOT TO SEE Z AS A BABY FORM!
F and n cried tears of happiness but they're still gems I like the fact that the gems that they got got swapped and I also like the fact that Q is the actual savior of f because if Q didn't give n the gem the same thing when it happened this was the real ending all along and also the fact thay they could all see their pass pretty cool I like how you show z's power is time travel and the fact that we got a baby Z was cool too because many people thought he was lava and he looks so much happier now probably because timeline change and he wasn't traumatized for life
the happy ending 🙂
We all needed this
Yessssss we Need it its so good q and z save the past and made a good Future Man i cry soo much with this ending
Do season 2
I can understand why n joined f, cause n stands for NIG-
Good ending
LES GO
OMG BABY z!
finally a good ending
The story we never needed but glad it exists
if only we saw the changed future
I’m glad that you was able to time travel so and would not like L  and O  join their team and that N and F got along nice
My name is Natalie and my fav letter is F  N F be friends lol
This was a masterpiece
When F started tearing up when N protected him...I also teared up a lil bit
But can you make more of this? If you do that would be cool then uppercase FM uppercase and we'll have fun and then they'll have their friends
Amazing.
“You got the good ending...”

Fantastic job! I like this series a lot, I wouldn’t mind shorts featuring the characters, especially the lesser used ones like W and X.
And everything was lovely once again. Wonderful.
n was nice to f

Nice
Yay! It’s the lowercase Z!
The good ending moment
'real happy ending'
Here me out, a canon number lore and at the end we see "A" appear as a cliff hanger ending and a couple months later we get Algebra lore
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢
That's good ending
The Truest Ending has been revealed, the FxN ship is finally legit, and now I hear "I Really Wanna Stay at your House".
The canon ending to the series. Now I can rest in peace
That. Was.                                                     Amazing.
Wow! It's nice
0:18 Did they say BTW?
0:01  They was sad bc they realize why F did that for. And it's was L and O fault he became evil. They saw what they did for a accident/prank f did.   The beginning or the epilogue was sad. But the ending was so wholesome..
Z dedass went I hate this ending  *Reverses time*
YO THIS IS AWESOME LETS GO
😭
This made me cry

I Know That F And N Was A Friend.
This is the best alphabet lore ending ever, and I liked how Z still has his voice even when he's young.
I love this ending
es el secreto de la f
Wait a minute I think I now get it after the alphabet remembered the past Z desided to restart the alphabet to when they were lowercase then n though it was bad to leave f so in the future F wouldn’t do anything bad like murder and kidnapping

0s Of Commenting
I always thought about an epilogue and this was beautiful. I had a feeling that something like this would happen and I was right.
I got Zz
I’m literally gonna cry
Cool video
z Looks So Cute, Ü
Best ending of all ❤🎉
Esta preciosidad es mejor que cualquier serie u película que he visto. Es el final más bello y justificado para terminar bien la historia. Muchas gracias Mike, por traernos la mejor animación de todas.
baby z
Abc lore 1 bad ending  Abc lore 2 good ending Do you think n N is the main character?
I make me repeat the video 2 times And also we finally have a happy ending Q help us to fix the time
Can you make a number lore... Please?
ZZZZZZ
This Is the sweet lore we needed

🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 I absolutely fuckung love this I love the og alphabet lore and since watching I’ve wanted a sequel or some kind of continuouactuon and this epilogue is just what I needed it’s perfect  we needed a good ending after all that misery and sadness of the first one
Esperen H sigue muerto xd
2:00 lowercase z
New lore!!1!1!
I wonder if there's going to be number lore.
Z makes everyone go back to time, n saves f from l, m, and o. Both n and f get beat up, they switch their gems, both of them go into the cave and are happy, and we actually see Z’s lowercase form. *E P I C*
I figure out it says gay
That...          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG
The happy ending 😊
한국인들도 보는 중입니다! 한국인들 있나요?
I literally just watched this for the first time yesterday. :0
The 2 ending

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ALPHABET LORE ENDED
You know this is a good animation when baby N's black eye doesn't swap sides when when character flips
good ending
Questions tho Is F still dead? Or is N changing the past??? *Confusion*
Good ending
Finally! A ending that we needed!
Alphabet lore part final is f and n is friend ending :)
When I saw this i was jumping around and accidentally dropped my phone on baby z
So cute and great content
This... is very happy.
nZ... when n finishes watching his backstory of him and F
Finally! The good ending! 🥺😺
Lo and behold the hero, baby n
The ending that we all needed
The ending if N actually was never be a coward
now i can imagine f x n - its gonna be horrible. So for your prescription for this cringe ship you're gonna need bleach.
now this is what i wanted
z
We don’t want F to get lonely
Next episode(maybe): Next time, won't you sing with me...
They made an alt story that we needed. Thank you so much. Now that F and N are Freinds, Peace is finally stored thanks to Z
N = im Not a coward
Thanks I needed that, that's one less depression on my back.
WOW Great!
God bless alphabet yes I was actually waiting for this the ending have a good day Mike

Q and N is legends ngl
Z was like nah I ain’t having this ending I’m gonna make an better one with myself and Q help me Q:alright gives n the ?
Please add this to the alphabet series!
So z made n go back in time to fix this all or the n in the past knows what’s gonna happen
I wonder if  he will ever make more?
Fn.
Good ending
The best ending possible.
Yeah
why do i just feel like he read one of my comments in history
Nice Ending this is so sad
Alphabet Lore Is Your Way To Exercise And Create Better Animations ¡LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED! ¡YOU CREATED A MASTERPIECE!
Yay Z is finally smiling
Ha, there’s no way he’s gonna add the good end- OH MY GOD
Wow
This is awesome
-so there were 2 good endings?-  i was wrong  there were not 2 good endings
We need to call Hollywood my friends, this man has done it again! Praise him for I have never been so exited in my life!!
Q ', EAT IT BOI  N ', *LITRALLY SWAOLLOWS IT*
It's z
nice
At first, i thought it was a fan made epiloge just looking at the thumbnail, but now, i'm just surprised ! What an ending ! Great job dude ! You made an absolute masterpiece of a series !
Good ending
Maybe you should do numbers vs letters I think It would be a great episode
BABY Z !!!!!?!?!?!?!??
OMG YESSSS IT'S HERE
F just wanted friends before L and O were bullies so F and N are now friends
I almost cried #friends
Good ending man
That's is happy ending.
You unlocked the good ending. Congratulations.

Final feliz
Yay!A happy ending!  But I ron't understand what this changes. F probaly doesn't do the same stuff and is happier I guess Would've like to see the future after the epiloge but I don't really expect that
The good ending
Wow it's a happy ending!
Their is a deleted scene in the scene
AAA THIS MADE ME CRY SO MUCH THANK YOU MIKE FOR POSTING THIS I'M EXETREMELY HAPPY-
Early
Yay happy ending for everyone!
YES, F IS HAPPY NOW
Z looked way different then we predicted he’s not blue ofc I thought he would not show his baby version But nvm he did way different
Wait so the Ellipsis gem can change timelines?
There may have been foreshadowing on why the series didn’t end, we didn’t see the lowercase z until the epilogue came, that meant the series didn’t end.
This is so awesome the end should of been like this 🥲
Well I hope "i" will be together with "F" and "n" to get a matching word
The next episode should be "Next Time Won't You Sing With Me"
yes
Cant wait for Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me!
Wait.... why does lowercase z still has such a deep voice?
the good ending moment
Good show
😃😃😃😃
babe wake up, new content milking heaven just dropped
GOodN  ending :  n apoligize to f
C2 added
Three was the future of n and f?
El final q todos nesisitabamos
F and n got beat up together and thats all that matters
this is why i like plot twist
Best friend
Zum Glück
Im gonna miss this, ending was great tho.
This is perfect.
This ending is more depressing than any anime I have ever watched. Truly remarkable

Good ending
True or expectative ending

No se si alguien de aquí sepa español pero este fue el mejor final de todos, ahora falta saber que pasó ahora sí el pasado ha sido cambiado

Omgggggg
Realmente me encantó en final, es lo que necesitábamos ;') Bueno... Aunque honestamente no quiera que "F" muriera ;—;
And big F is dead!

I cried when N did hugs P

This is lovely
What happened to X? I don’t see him in this alternate timeline and I’m worried. He’s my favorite.
The good ending
Wow we needed this ending
OMG NEW VIDEO WOO
now if this is the last piece to see all
i got recommended by this should i watch it all?
That’s why I don’t prefer to put the LMNOP in the alphabet song. I got used to it since I was in 2008. Also I prefer xylophone pasta over dragon soup.
Now we know how baby z looks like
And they were roomates...
Now I know my ABCs, next time won’t you *WATCH* with me?
I found BTW
Wow! That's awesome!!
No Canada
But we never got to know what happened to F and N,like did they just live in the mountain without any problems?
0:15 WAKE UP
Happy ending
This ending is awesome! f and n together❤
Is this the good ending, the " true " ending, or the alternative ending?
Alphabet lore was crazy but this is even more crazy
ABC 4

Man this is the best epilogue ever
ABC 2
Wow that was a ver good ending I enjoined it but I didn’t knew Z will restart the world like that normaly so I guesss in the next episodes I think N and F will be bad or something like that
Amazing!! There are no words that can better express my feelings RN. Just Wow!!!
Just wondering. Is this the canon ending or is it where F dies?
ABC  3
Happy the end
Claim ur within an day ticket
It sooooo cute.😭
I never knew I wanted this 🥲
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa he finally
So now N and F are gonna be the ones to cause the chaos instead of just F. Epic
HAD ME IN TEARS. 10/10 STORY.
Hi
dont forget “next time wont you sing with me” we might get a number lore
Why am I crying over letters
And what happened to F and N not be a evil guy more a happy guy has her friends for forever  <;)
damn this is so good
0:23 scares me
i want number lore okay
Wow this is so good
Wait what? So lowercase z is not a developing planet?
Melhor final do mundo Ou melhor do "Z" Quero muito ver como as letras se comportaram no bom futuro Pois no que o "F" não tem amigos é uma triste história mas o com o "N" ele terá um amigo e talvez seja diferente
finally, another video

We need another alphabet lore lime the numbers come in and f and n  they get like a map from a box and follow the map to a x that leads to a chest with the & symbol  idk what else it would be cool to have it til the number 100 or smth and they have to close a portal with the & symbol I guess
This is very great ending And Z Not crying anymore
Now we need "Next time won't you sing with me" to show what happens to the entire series after this
1:55

Pov:you got the best ending in a video game.
The happy ending (:
are you going to do more
I really loved this epilogue and the whole story, it was a journey of emotion, action and with this ending I cried  I would also like to know what music was used in various scenes here and in the rest of the chapters, and if it is created for the Alphabet Lore to be able to listen to it without sound effects   Edit: Ok, now I know it's music with no copyright (I'd say free to use but you have to pay a bit to use them freely)
Finally a nice ending!!!!!!!!!!!!
Give us the alternative series
The true ending
Nice end
Alphabet Lore Part 2 Characters: Æ Œ Û Ï Ę
*se va a chillar en su cuarto*
Good endings
Good ending
It would be nice if you make an "would you like to sing with me" episode or the alphabet lore but nothing happened (U W, X, Y and Z introduce normally)
Mike Please Make Season 2 Or The Universal Collision It’s About Number Lore,Symbol Lore And Another Types Of Lore
I love it
It part 2
& what else
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
So nice i am going to 😢👏👍😄😃
F DID NOTHING WRONG!! He wanted his friend back :)
1:12 Needs one a to make Lmao
That was the best ending ever! Also I love Z’s lowercase form because he’s so cute! 😂
Here is some part of my understanding is that Q gave the question mark gem to N and N was the only one who remembered what happens in the future. So Z rewinded time so N can make a better future for the letters. And I guess N and F ran away to the mountain and will grow up together at least that's what I think. Also N learned how to tear gems :O
🥲🥲
YEAH
Some Ones Maded A Unofficial Fanmade Happy Endings Of Alphabet Lore But.., I CAN'T BELIVIE YOU MADED A OFFICIAL ONE OF THE HAPPY ENDING OF ALPHABET LORE!!!, I LIKE YOUR VIDEO!, Beatiful Video! 😄
Let's face it, we all needed this ending.

That was kinda sad but He was become friend again

The Real Good ending
Now this is a good ending F in the comments
The Good ending of alphabet lore
I hope we get a sequel to the Alphabet lore.
The first time I've seen Z's power and his lowercase
Yes, the good ending where F isn't longer evil and be friends with n again
Wow the ending was very epic

Alphabet Lore: Bad Ending vs. Good Ending
Let me guess, the full version is gonna be called something like: Next Time Won’t You Sing With Me? (Alphabet Lore)
Yo I really thought the series would get the ONE treatment. But you really went to make a good ending. Bravo.
I was so speechless about the good ending
Finally

If it still wasn't finished, It would be called Next time wont you sing with me? (or epilogue 2) And it retells everything of the alphabet lore but with no lore, Probably.
So cute

No joke i actually cried
WOAH
Never see baby Z yet
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

lowercase Z is real
:;.,&?!
Actually f it’s not your fault  some letters are trying to hit u But it’s l and o are fault
everyone is talking about the ending, but why is no one talking how Z saved everyone
That ending made me cry,it will always be an happy ending
Also why didn't M stop L and O
O love the ending
1:06 POV: n

Che. Bello🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭😍😍🤩😘
Wait a min IS Q IS BABY YODA?!??!?!!!!?!?!?!? BABY YODA IN ALPHABET LORE CONFIRM?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Can we PLEASE get more of this. Like for example, make alternate alphabet lore like a different dimension or something.
We all knew this would happen, but we didn’t know when, but now the true ending is finally here
What a good ending what a good ending😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢🥳
OMGGGGG Z DID ITTTTTTTT
Well done you just created a masterpiece i mean it

HOLD UP Z IS AN PLANET
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
This is so cute
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Nice
Make number lore
Now is not alphabet lore now is alphabet good lore
Congratulations you found the good ending!
W H O A     NO WAY BRO IA THIS A DREAM
I cannot describe how much I love this ending
The good ending none of the series happened everyone just introduces themselves
A good ending finally  this is what we needed I am going to a Theory my replies
This is quite interesting story wise. How will N siding with F change the story when the letters mature? What will happen with the rest of the lettervengers now that N is with the antagonist? This also answers the question of what do Z's gems do? They are time gems. Notice how when you use ... at a word, it extends it out? It's like your slowing down time. It's like the correlation of gems and their powers with the rest of the gem weilders. The epilouge is both a good ending and a **beep**ing cliffhanger. We need a hecking sequel to this
Great story👍👍👍
oh my god this is what I always wanted
Every have a good ending
Une fin maniphyque et qui se termine sur une note positive
Lowercase Z is here!
we all needed such a masterpiece
Z IS FINALLY A BABY YAY
Me watching the video: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😥😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😩😩😩😩
what happened to Z?
the real friends
I Kinda Imagine Z Being 10000 Years Old As An Adult. And z Being 1000 Years Old When Lowercase
this ending also makes me in tears, very nice
ahh and at the end, everyone is happy! when i thought we're getting the sad ending this miracle happen.
So do N and F both become evil now?
This is the good ending. We look very sad on what happened at the normal story of letter F
Z used his power to tell Q To Make Things Right So Z Could Be Happy
Wow  video😭😭😭
Abc lore chapter 2!!!!!!!
If Alphabet Lore (The series) and Alphabet Lore (Epilogue) create a Fusion and create Alphabet Lore (Complete)
z: MY PLAN WORKED!!!!!!
We finally get to see lowercase Z
🥲🥹🥹🥹
Truly alternative
Baby z so cute
Good idea mike salcedo
good ending
Here’s another  Ending  we all needed
lower case z.  if it wasnt for l and o we would have lowercase z
Finally we found Z’s lowercase!
Now we know what baby Z looks like!
So the power of Z is reverze the time
Omagah
WAIT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID THAT😟❤
1:17 f Looks Totally Wholesome
This ending made my skeleton say adios, say bonjour, and then say adios again in the span of a nanosecond
The epic ending
Very cool
and then the future has F being nice to everyone (except for L, M and O)
АБВ?
Wait… Does P like lowercase n? Just saying apart from G?
MY HEART
Why couldn't you switch this in alphabet lower instead of the alternate ending
💕💕💕💕💕🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤜🤛
woah. never thought THIS would come out. its nice that N fixed everything so the world could go back to how it shouldve been.
1:08 tescirv fahbdkujw
Now we know what Z’s power is
:O I. LOVE. IT.
Now The letters Knew Why F Is not mean Poor F Died
Good ending😁
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Epic
F and n r good😭
We can expect an better future now
EPIC ENDING: n didnt betrayed f
Thanks for my request 🥹
OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST EVER
LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
0:23 ????
Good ending
now we know what the ellipses do
THE GOOD ENDING
Q and Z are the true heroes, "..." can go after a sentence to indicate that it will continue, but it can also go before to indicate something came before it, so once Z cried the "..." it was able to go before everything happened, and Q knew this because of the "?", so they gave it to N in order to keep their memories, I was expecting this to have a bad ending (because we don't get enough of those), but this happy ending is pretty much a great conclusion to the story :)
I am happy n went back in time to alternate the past so L and O would not break there friendship leaving L and O as the true bad guys.F and N can finally be best friends forever
A happy ending I love it
Damn can't believe this the original video was 2 months ago still this video brings us will be memory in a future.    -FrostChrome
Make a part 2 make a part 2
I Hope This Is Just Part 2
F = E
:D
So this man was able to do something ( Z )
Please do the number lore
And then i think x,l,o,m had no gems
NEXT PART N & F
Is a very very good
godddd
I love this, 10/10, awesome work!!!!
nooooooooooooooo f
I have always wondered what will f look like when he's with friends with N
YAAAAAAY NOW WE HAVE BABY Z WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Plot twist: they are now both evil
Ooooooo!!!!! :0 finally the end ooo!
Part 2
WOW
I wanna hear     Lowercase voices  u v w x b g j k m p

FINALY
Lowerscare z
What's unique is how Z Basically reversed Time, however N remembered the previous future (the bad one)
Aaaaaaawwwww
Wow 🤩 Mike u actually made a lower case z  And nice animations u really a legend for creating alphabet lore
Q has telekinesis?😮
this is that type of movie right here
This is gotta be the Good Ending
Baby Z is so cute
when you thought it was finished
S+ tier ending 🫡🫡🫡
Tbh, this is more perfect than my custom sequel that hasn’t came out yet  Edit: the sequel was supposed to be about a another S named “S the 2nd” getting revenge on F for “killing” S. But time was reversed and N made it where F didn’t become the bad guy sooooo…
This Is The Day We Found Lowercase Z, There's No Lowercase Z, But Now There Is...
good ending:
Well done! Well done!
9
0:00: So NOW THE REST OF THE ALPHBET FEELS REMORSE. Also Z's lowercase appearance is adorable. I'm glad N got reunited with his friend F! He took a moment to think what they did to him.
This video made is so heart warming
THE WAY P KISS
Finally lowercase Z and N owns the ? mark.
good ending
0:23 Q just said: HURRY UP, GET THE QUESTION MAR-
TY SO MUCH FOR THE TRUE  ENDING
Cutest Part 1:36
It’s almost as if Mike had the question mark, he literally answered basically all of our alphabet lore question, great job man, mad respect. ps: “A” for some reason is set for kids and now there are no comments or miniplayer, could this be fixed?
q and z be in harry potter rn
I will love if you do the story were N and F ar doing like the normal alphabet lore
0:13 so Z is a Planet...i thought this was wrong lol
this is cool!  we finally get to see z!
So Z real power of the planet is reverse the time within ellipsis (...)? That's amazing awesome!
Now im interested in the endings, that was a good ending, what abt bad ending? Or secret ending?
THE HAPPY ENDING now F won't hurt anyone anymore
wow this is by the real creator woww
This is much better now
God this is such a DANM good epilogue, Z does whatever he can for a good ending.
Aæ
F x N?
sleep time
this is mike salcedos vidos?
Hermoso
10/10 Thats all I can say
i'm crying this is so beautiful
wow i like alphabet lore
yes finally
What happens after?
even in this newfound happy ending, g still somehow gets ran over by f xD
The fact that z didn't accept the fact the ending is like this and that.  Q gave the question mark to n so he know what he should've done and n stood up for him self and not be forced around  It is amazing the alphabet lore is now my favorite
Best ending
Like this review from all the reviews please pls plzzzzz 🙏 👇
sooo good
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
When n is walking the jump is kinda smooth
I wonder if there's gonna be a sequel to this amazing lore
f
F is now good
Now Dead F doesn't have a soul
I almost cry 😭
Aaaawwwwwwwwww
Wow You... Make a.... GOOD ENDING AWSOME I WANT TO CRY OMG!!!!
OMG WHOA-
a couple hours ago i thought it was fanmade but i was like: “no fanmade person would make something good like this”
Why they sad about F?
I could have never expected this, it’s just the perfect ending.
After 2 months of alphabet reactions, alphabet in russian and alphabet fanarts we have already the epilogue!
👍👍👍👍👍👍
im litraly crying this is such a good ending
This is the best ending ever 😭👍
YES A GOOD ENDING YESSSSSSSS
😭😭
Finally a baby z
Why F is always wanted to get off G in his way
Where is ñ
If everyone thinks it’s over its not Z use has Power to go back in time and Q knows what’s going on so Q throw the ? at N mouth so he won’t forget was gonna happen in the future
Siii  f and n and p and z
BROS BACKKKK
For real this is better than anything that marvel has ever done
Emboldened by the knowledge of what would happen little N had the courage to standup for their friend and prevent the frickening, thus saving all the alphabet from a dark future. I also love the detail that only the deserving letters get their punctuation power ups, nothing for the bullies. True Justice in alphabet lore.
THIS IS SO COOL   Edit:WHY DONT I HAVE ANY LIKES >:(
And when the world needed him the most, he returned!!
finally the ending we all needed. Z reset the universe and N changed the fate of F.
I just realized that p is the only  alphapet got power given by n
You created something so beautiful just by using the alphabet
🥲
Oh finally the z its baby
Holy cow! Well done dude! Also, how do you feel about people making cheap copies of the original alphabet lore?
Wow f si

NAHH CUZ WHY DOES LITTLE Z LOOK SO CUTE EVEN WHEN THEY ARE HAPPY 😭💕
Not gonna lie, I disliked N more than any other letter for just how bad he abandoned his best friend. But this ending was just beautiful. Now F and N can be friends like they were meant to be

Z’s gem is rewinding time of course.

Los amigos son amigos para siempre por siempre en las buenas y en las malas
Weird...?

Certified very cool:
Heres My Rankins In The Characters Combining this with A-Z  Good 1: N 2: Q 3: P 4: Z 5: C 6: G 7: X 8: A 9: M 10: U 11: B 12: Y Neutral 13: F 14: I 15: V 16: K 17: R 18: T 19: S 20: W 21: H Evil/Rude 22: D 23: E 24: J 26/25: L and O
Now we know what baby Z is and Z’s power
What an ending we got right here, we though it was done but no, this is the real ending and it turned our amazing, what's better is that N & F no longer feared the bullies and stayed friends, then when they grow up nothing bad happens to them this time becuase F is now friendly, this was the best ending we could get from a story like this, the animation in this turned out better then before too
LOWERCASE zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW I LOVE IT
У неед тне z мпдел

This series didn't teach me my ABCs but it did teach me what an ampersand is! Did you know that & had a name that that wasn't "the and symbol" because I did not.
WE FINALLY SAW LOWERCASE Z and this is why Z is nice
finally an happy ending..
Hey
This is a perfect ending for a few reasons F gets a friend  Nobody will die F never harms anyone N stands up for himself Q and Z can finally rest Congrats Mike, you’ve outdone yourself
It’s crazy how Q also helped z, by putting *HIS* question mark into n so he can tell the past and future.
Owww that cute 🥺
Yay I'm early
Z is a hero❤ and little n
Wait so is Z the ground of the letters or the god?
Pls mike salcedo 1 more ending when they grow up

The story of Kindness and Love.
This should be the real thing here, all you letters need to give F an apology
Woah

This was perfect! An amazing cap to end the series!

I like that ending f and n r now friends
So cool😊
Give this man an Oscar
Now I want Lankybox to react to this
Dude n really came back to time AND THIS IS THE BACKSTORY WE NEEDED BRO I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPENED IN THE FUTURE BROOO!
Why is a punch it with n and f
I just realized he spelled friends
this was short, amazing.
The good ending😢😢 That is so sad
😭😭😭
alphabet lore but good ending
Here it is.
So, Z can control time?
epic
i think i get what happened, first Z made time go back, and since N got the powers of the black gem before time rewinds, he knows what happens and chooses to go with f, happy ending
I still like the fact you combined Zee and Zed into Zeed.
N is so cute 🥰
0:18 Truly a sight seeing Z's tears form into a ring! Can't believe I would be at an event so special it would play with time itself..
The end is absolutely fantastic. I first thought this was a sad story , but never mind that now (I guess)👏👏👏👏
I almost cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Witch means there would be a epesode 29!  Edit: I became correct lol
Masterpiece! I’m glad we got a good ending AND the lowercase version of Z!

Yeah that pretty smooth!

Fun fact: the vowels are only in the odd number of their position in the alphabet Go have a try to count the 26 letters!
What happened is Z went back in time but the gem was in Q still and N got it but the gem stayed in N and knew the future and then the happy ending happened.

ALPHABET LORE GOOD ENDING
I'm really can't believe how well this thing is made
mike salcedo can you voice soup earth society’s 44
I think Z give ? gem to Q and Z in this ending doesnot want to see this and Q quickly give ? Gem to N and Z reverse the time to childhood and n know what to do and then everything goes well and we know ... gem using for control time and ? Gem using for looking to their childhood and Q try to stop everyone but unlucky Q is slug so Q is so slow and when everyone know about F F is died and we all know l and o was start it all l and o target is anyone and l and o target n and f try to protecting f try to revenge by using a r and t to spell fart and l and o target f and l push f to the prank we known "frick" word everyone doesnt like that and everyone attack and then next to adult timeline F attack everyone execpt P and G but P still attack F and P is injured G try to revenge so F attack everyone even N and when F died Q try to tell their childhood and Z see it all so Z reverse time because Z dont want to see it all hold on z tongue is orange? i tought it was n plush oops i forgot ? Gem born from f tear
Im waiting so long for that
Uh where is v? Is he a scaredy cat?
Everything What People Said Was Wrong, This Is The REAL Lowercase Of Z
THANKS  MIKE SALCEDO FOR THIS ENDING OF ALPHABHET LORE😍😍😍

0:18 B T W (by the way)
1:17 WHY IS HIS FACE GOOFY
Bruh this episode is so unnecessary... You just ruined the masterpiece you created with generic happy ending... What a disappointment (
Oh
Lowercase z
Alphabet lore the good ending
I felt like i was gonna cry after watching this
Uh oh, fanfics
Wait z is not old nor cracked.. does that mean F aged Z?
Next Time Wont You Read With Me?
I knew that those three dots meant something
Looks like real deal man
This is so wholesome and happy help
ITS HERE OMG
The lost alphabet "v"
Thank you
well this sucked
Hired me I’m also good animation
N saved the day because if N didn't make F happy F would have revenge. And almost everyone would get destroyed by F
Looks like the ellipses has the power to turn back time... that's genius Edit: Looks like Z is also a gem user all a long.
The good ending
Z is finally lowercase and I like the part where he spawns a blue bubble
Wow that was sad story
2:03

One more thing, I don't think they can revive, right? Reply down. (Only the creator replies)
THEY GOT MARRIED!!
This is only the beginning...  Now I know why h is the silent letter
I almost cried this is the best video ive ever watch
The original lowercase z is here now!
I ❤ F and N
This is the true ending and I love it
The "next time won't you sing with me?" Part might be the ending Credits
the ending good
I was so sad because f was alone when I saw this I was super happy
But remember, there must be a "Next time won't you try with me"
yay its cool
*F* i *N* ally the ending we needed
Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The good ending
Now please do number lore.
Alphabet Lore but this alternative ending
wait did Q give the question mark to N so he can go back there again and fix this? and does Q have powers? (he lifted the question mark with his long eyes)
YOOoOoo
B+T+W=BTW=By the way
I love the end
THE ENDING SONG LOOKS LIKE TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR IM SHOKED WOOWOWOWOWOWOWOW WHATWGATWGATWGATWHATWHAUTWHATWHTAHWTAHWTAHWTAHRWHATWHATWHTAHWTAHWTAHWTWHAYWHATWHATHWWWHATTWGATWWHAT
when it was just a dream and this is the actual ending:
I knew it they can go back in time
Then we all know what Z looks like as a baby
This one little series about the alphabet has me more invested in the lore than most movies and TV shows
did i just cry over letters?
I can’t believe they just reversed time itself
we need number lore
😢Bitter-sweet
The best ending ever
Yes
I found lowercase z
🤧🤧🤧😓😤🥺😫😫😱🥺
what a happy ending
2:03 Baby Z
wait... what happens after that?
z!  Edit1: is lowercase Z cute?
Let there be a lesson: do not bully people do not abandon them don't hurt their feeling just do anything just to make him happy  This story teaches us: to be nice to people and everyone deserves a chance  So attention to all viewers: do not do this again or you'll happen like f Such a inspiring story....
good ending?
A happy ending
now im leaving
BABY Z GOT LEAKED
the Baby z hasn't got any ellipsis
0:17 This looks like when Four took over the sun in BFB 1:01 I remember when he hid behind G...
Z
2:01 BABY Z!!
I couldn't be happier
I dunno I think I like the tragic ending better
You said it milk
One thing I noticed: n gives p the exclamation mark because she didn't abuse it to be a bully, she thought f was a villain because she was with g at the time, n or f didn't give l m o a gem. Wait nvm all the gems are there
yayayayyayayay
*Happy ending for ever*
LETS GOOO
Q and Z were the saviors of this world ❤ Z knew he had to do something about this mess and made N go back in time so he could fix this all. 😊
when the world needed him the most, he appeared.
good ending
The True Ending.
O Everson muito amigos o n e o f Eles são muito amigos um do outro😍😭❤
God ending i seen that 4 5 hours ago
alphabet lore: the regret
Where do numbers fit in the universe?
THE GOOD ENDING
Z finally stopped crying
The bad ending becomes the good ending
Maste Piece
Im not crying m-my eyes are just sweating
I im sooooooo happy but what abt the good ending's future
You cant spell FUN without F and N                  I mean you also cant spell FUNERAL without F but thats not the point
You’ve unlocked: The good ending.
Finále lower case z
respect to Q and the ? for this
Zzz…
Now combine both together and you get full alphabet lore!
IT SHOULD END LIKE THIS BUT IT DIDNT SO SADLY
As much as I like this good ending, the other part before this could've also counted as an ending and I would still think its great
My bed is full of tears
F becomes a good boy now
Im
I loved the animation that Q made when he gave the Question Mark Stone to N, the animation was also cool when Z used his stone to turn back time, and since N is on Fs team now i guess the future is changed
So, since the past was TOTALLY altered, I wonder what the future would be like.
The ending I needed for real
Ay
To mike salcedo what does Z's orbital do
BEST ENDING EVER
OMG IS THE TRUE ENDING!!!
Absolute infinity happy ending :)
Words cannot describe how incredible your animations are. You deserve so much more subscribers
this ending.. EVERYTHING WAS RESET TO THE START OF L AND O’S UNDOING! IT ALL CHANGED! NOW F ISN’T GOING TO TERRORIZE THE OTHER LETTERS! THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING, AND I CAN’T EXPLAIN THE WORDS I AM FEELING RIGHT NOW-
I dreamed of this getting a sequel
I love how this ends
I love the detail of the gems making an “&” symbol. This is a sweet ending :)
This is lots of comments for a 2:11 episode
The Z Mini Is Not Cry He Very Happy
What if they in uppercase?
Really didn’t expect to wake up to this! Really amazing animation and a proper end to the series we all needed
i understand it now
The way F laugh is kinda....
z looks cute
The time is reversed
I like when Z sleeps its night
The Good ending No   More Fighting  N  want a firendship of f
This is a masterpiece, now this is a happy ending :)
I'm so glad it's back to normal now 🙌 😌
make more pls
Holy shit
What about the forgotten letter, thorn
The fact that you can make an amazing story like this with just alphabet letters.
Reveal K's gender please
l M O:WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
WOW n👍
now we need number Lore!
😃😃😃😃😃 :’)
now that we've established the world building, now we just need to explore the other characters and get to know them better (e.g: K, T, and S) We also need to know how Z ended up as basically the whole world the letters sit on.
Q was the hero we needed but do not deserve
The ending we all needed, I never thought that we would be able to get a happy ending tho but good thing it was made :))
Final bueno: en otro universo F sera amable :D
Plot twist: this is not the ending. the ACTUAL ending is next time won’t you sing with me
Dude…. The fact this was released on my birthday… 😢🎉 Thank you, Mike.
I love this I wish there was more of these lores made by you I loved alphabet lore so good thank you for the ending but I wish does more I respect it
Ummmm that was the lowercase z?
This Is The Best Ending Ever Exist, I Was Suprised When I Saw The Video And I Was Really Word-less When I Saw The Ending🥲👏
Perfect ending.
and 0:18 BTW - By the way.
zzzzzzzzz
The Good Ending.. :)

Z:travels make in time so nobody dies h:what about me?
Z was sad in the beginning... But now..HE HAS THE POWER!
Request: alphabet lore good ending part 2   What happens in vid: L and O get beaten up by all the other letters  To: Mike Salcedo
Finally... Nobody will argue about z!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 good ending
The good ending
WOW i never knew he would put a good ending in the abc lore
POV : You finally looked up a guide on where to find all 500 Pinecones in Alphabet Lore 26 to get The TRUE Ending after bawling your eyes out at The Game's Normal Ending
This is amazing. Z is also a Chad for showing his lowercase version.
now we need a final titled "Next Time Wont You Sing With Me"
What if they both became bad guys and do the killing
Omg that is real?! Yes!
Now *_that_* is wholesome, the best thing I've seen in a while.  Better than most movies nowadays. Noice
Aww!
that's Zs power
The "KAÆEH" Still gets me tho 😭
WAIT WHAT?!?
At first I thought it was fammade but when I saw it was official I shouted I’m happy that there was a good ending
Finaly... Happy ending:)
I know it, you knew it, we all needed this end
the ending we all needed. also Z’s lowercase form is sooo cute
Wow wow👌👌what a good ending. *claping*
FINALLY A NEW VIDEOOOOOO I love happy endings
Me hearing z's voice: what
like a wise letter once said: Quooooh
nah i forgot my ABCs, could you repeat that again?
YYEEEE
I love the new ending!! And I like z’s lowercase
But I do love how everybody found out, if was not the villain
But where's the sequel?
according to my calculations N and F are both equal and same color as black as evil ones 1 evil hero and 1 main villian (sorry from my pronouns)
Now we Now what lowercase Z looks like
:)
1:16 aww F's face looks adorable
Q’s eyes are terrifying when he feeds N lol
ok so..  N goes back in time basically  And helps f  Then thats just the happy ending
Lowercase Z! :D
Congratulations! You open Best Ending!
Name: Z Gem: Elipses Ability: Change the past
wholesome 1000000000000000000000000 (that’s 1 nonillion)
I’m literally bout to cry it’s amazing
Good endibg
This is what we were waiting for
Now they know F's plan And we get to see Z doing something Respect Q  Edit:Saturn be like
Wow
this is the saddest ending in the world
This is awesome Im cries at this moment
The best ending
I was wondering if you could make the number lore 1-10
Omg
Вотэда я понимаю концовка
Good ending
Yayyyyyy🥹🥹
wow this is making me crying even z it’s so cute🥹🥹
THEY MADE AN &
This is more like a new part. z.

Wow i really cry bc its so sad and so true bc it happends to me once
Did anybody else see the female version of these?..
Z is so big
🥺
Hey now we see lowercase Z
Dont cry. Don't cry. •ends up crying•
f & n gems formed the “&” sign (1:33)
MIKE SALCEDOOOO I THOUGHT THIS WAS CLICK BAIT BUT TY
@Mike Salcedo .... thank you for this. When I saw the previous ending I literally started crying. After watching this my mood became a lot better  However, there is a question in my head that I had for a while...   What will be next after the good ending?
Do the alternative ending
I want belive this is the real ending
n finally taught f how to walk properly
We have nZ We have Now I know My ABC's (Epilogue) And we will probably have the Next Time Wont You Sing With Me
I thought g said d 💀💀💀💀💀💀
good ending
this is honestly the best thing ever <3
Great, now more 12 year old girls are going to ship F and N more.
My fav part is when Q did this:KYoooooooooooooooooooooo
This is what true alphabet endings should be like. A good friend, that's all you need.
FINALLY THE OFFICIAL BABY Z!!!!
BRO BABY Z IS SO CUTE
Alphabet song: i am not popular even i made a song to teach kids Alphabet lore: i made 1M views in one day
Plot Twist : These time travel shenanigans have actually turned Alphabet Lore into a serialized TV Show where F and N are now the reoccurring villains that concoct devious yet harmless evil schemes just to secretly have fun and play with the rest of the alphabets (think of Dr. Doofenschmirtz)
I miss the origanal
truely absolutely art  The ending at its finest.
BRO BABYZ IS SO CUTE
good ending 😀
R didn’t get his revenge
Wait, if N gets the question mark… THEN WHAT WILL Q’S POWER BE?  (Also everyone will not get any power except P)
Mike can u remake but everyone is friends with F
Z's powers are confirmed to be controlling time as "." Stops any paragraf of letters and or words, the way it reverses time is that since it ends with a bad ending the reader must read again the story but with a twist as q gave it powers to n to stop the bad ending from happening
Wait... So Z can reverse time?? Huh cool
B & T & W Literally spell by the way
Lowercase z confirmed
Also Mike salcedo finely fixe Z
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
True ending: N make a new future and his friends aren't kiddnaped in the future
😢😢😢 wow
Beautiful moment
Since their friends what happens when their adults does N and F team up to kill the others but not P and G? Or just L And O
Sabia que ia ter continuação sabia
Interesting why z are crying if ending are sad z are crying now if the ending are good z are happy now
4 hours
Amazing I never thought we would get to see lowercasse z
I CANT BELIVE THIS IS CANNON
I'm happy there was a happy ending that none of us thought there would be
N did a good job that was the right solution
Was that lower case Z?!?
ok now what happends next ? are they both evil now? I NEED ANSWERRS or a new episode
…next time won’t you sing them with me?
Wow, finally lowercase z, but I just noticed… why is his voice still the same as uppercase Z if he’s a baby?
Now we need number lore
HOLY-
So you finally get to review Z as a baby because in the original Alphabet Lore Number Z was at the very end but there was no footage of Z being a baby at the end of the original Alphabet Lore
F you happy ?
Episode 1 is very need to help well episode 2 look like they fix it make Z happy now😄😄
This is better then all Netflix series combined
Good ending be like
😱
The ending we all wanted...
F and N may be hurt, but everyone (except for H) is still alive
Do another one with f and n doing there freind ship together
NO WAY

True ending
Yeah! Now can see lowercase Z! Only now need o transform!
Made My Cry
yea they got  the good ending
Lowercase z finally
to me it still feels kinda unfinished cuz they're friends now but l and o never got beat up
Z looks cute as a lowercase letter- (Im not simping) z does not have cracks so this may be the past Man now W and Z is my favorite characters of alphabet lore-
Finally another scene for Z and a look of z
Good ending
my god that's still beautiful but the "f" wasn't a villain he just got angry about what happened and "n" didn't choose him but this ending is the true ending where everyone will be friends until the "z" is happy
A-Z finally in peace, the most wonderful ending i ever seen.
Q give N  ?
YES AN ENDING   Watched it my boy G got disrespected 😢 I’m happy n got his ending though
if this didn't happen the ending would be saf
Finally Lowercase Z!

Good ending
YOO THIS IS FIRE THE FACT THAT WE SEE LOWERCASE Z IS AMAZING
Hey Mike Salcedo! I need permisson, i want to make a video about the full episode of alphabet Lore is that ok?, I'll put credits on Desc, ty 😄
3th part pls
That's very sweat
THE ENDING SO WHOLESOME BRO A KAVANAGH A OH IJAG
Theeeeee Ennnnnd -young Z
Before: Bad ending Now: Good ending
I love this... F is my favorite character.
I love it
Oh now my soul is at peace. Good ending.
😭😭THE BEST FINAL
Make a second version of alphabet lore but n and f are friends
Its happy ending
lowercase z is adorable
Words cant describe what did i saw !
The best ending EVER!
The Good Ending: F has a friend and won’t go evil Edit: Me realizing this was official
WHY DOES THIS MAKE ME CRY SO BAD- I'M STILL IN TEARS FOR 2 HOURS 😭😭😭
We get to see z as his lower case and a true ending😊
THAT WAS SO SAD
So now we know what the ellipsis can do. It can basically reverse time and the person who has F's question mark can alter the past if they want.
Omg i thought this was fanmade
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN-
I'm gonna talk about... WHY IS THIS NOT THE ALPHABET LORE ENDING
omg this is getting better pls make seseoan 2 pls?
I think Z its happy when in the past after they still are friends maybe “idk whats the reason so comment about ur theory”
Yay very nice and cute and nice we get lowercase z too
0:21 Q can pick up stuff with his eyes  Part 3 pls this is the best thing ever
Aoooooooooo z
This almost made me cry! Keep it going Mike! :D
찐이누?
That Ending Is WAY Better Than The Original Because the original made me cry.
Q is the best side character. prove me wrong. and N a late main character
#FnN Edit: #QsavesTheWorld
Letter z is cute!
This ending was so Wholesome
Ура с F все хорошо!
BABY Z?!
Awwww cute Friends :)
Yay good ending
New alphabet lore achievement:you got true ending
I knew there had to be a sequel. Thank you so much!
Wouttuodhja
Make part 3
Uoe
Z IS TOOOOO CUTE......
Call that the f;!nale
Cool Mike
if q wasent a snail they would of not of killef f but god himself reversed time
Ayyyyy I saw the symbol "&" in 1:33!
Bro thats literally my theory let me explain:so after that Z gets another ball but those balls are actually endings and he got the 3rd how? As we saw z goed back in time to make better endings but instead ended up making it sadder so he tryed once last time with Q's help and he did it he made the best ending   Endings:1st planet:F killing every alphabet lore letter :bad ending  Second planet: F getting killed without even Q warning them and none of the letters are hurt:neutral ending   Planet 3:as you know this ending F dies manages to tell his friends the word "friends" Q warns them:sad ending   Last planet:Z trys again and manages to make N know the future with the help of Q F and n are at the cave even though they are lonely they are    ' "friends":Best ending   And theres my theory its the same as this a bit
Makeup
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
this is the true ending, forget the other one.
I love how K is just flying at Zs 1 ring
i like good ending😘
Put yer hand up if U hate l, m and O ✋✋✋✋
im happy everything end like this :)
Im not kidding Alphabet lore Is EPIC! Ps-The ending almost made me cry😭😭
The better thing is is that it is made by the same creator that made alpha bet lore
Best episode cuz Q
good ending
wow
YES I,m crying 😭😭😭😭😭 Reply pl
Yay!
I love this
So that’s where fn comes from
:)
Part 2 anyone?
btw when f fell they spelled IMAO
Mike can you do alphabet lore pt 2 a-z
let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo baby
FINNALY
did z reverse time like pro gamer
We have all the gems..   "..." can rewind time.  And if you mix ";" and "?" you get "&"..   "&" contains the power or freindship between n and f.
Something symbolic I noticed which makes this the true ending:  f & n  combined can be pronounced as "fin", meaning "end".
I can not stop watching is there a tears of joy emoji?
Bro
HAPPY ENDING
FINALLY Z IN LOWER LETTERCASE
Are f****** dreams come fu***** true
what amazing ending and friendship and lowercase z as chunky
I like the happy ending
Next time won't you sing with me?
😊

Good ending
What i called... The Good ending.
The ending is so cool
The good end
You must have to have a full video of this in the series
Lmao
THIS IS THE END WITH ALPHABET LORE?!¿¡😳🥲
After the events of F who got fucking shot with a  gay beam and F got fucking bullied by nerds I M O and n be friends with F and kinda saved the place and one bitch name chubby Z  open his mouth and SAY ZZZz like a fucking Minecraft villager that all you need to know F got fucking  vaporized

YOOOOOO
The last part is ...
Good Ending This One Want To Make Me Cry To.
So sad to realize, what n and f are now a freaks, they are now can be happy together, but sad, what they can't make new friends :(
OMG SO GREAT!
I always wanted the ending
YAY!
Akhirnya dapet good ending
ต่อครับ

Well I guess I have to find a way for this to work with my alphabet lore 2 I guess it’s an alternate universe
That is good ending
WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS REAL!??   *H O W*
An ending we didn't know that would exist, but one that we all needed.
Z, the real hero.

Zz
Ah yss... f and n... Used to make the most powerful word of all...      *FORTNITE*
I now your ABC....i am sad
Awww baby Z is so cute
The best ending
Huh, the good ending.
power of QYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hey Mike salcedo i have a question(please answer): are you going to make a number lore considering the fact that there are alot of number lore videos already?
The true ending
I.  Like. Baby. Z
Wait the thumbnail-
I’m finally early on a video for once
._.
The sequel nobody asked for, but everybody needed.
I hope they get to go back and be with the rest of the letters eventually and take down the LMO bullies
We better get next time won’t you sing with me
We need a season 2 pls
Looks we can finally say…  That brings this story to its happy conclusion. N doesn’t feel like a coward. F’s ostracization will in time be forgiven and won’t lead to F’s evil rampage. Q doesn’t need to worry about chasing his friends anymore. And at long last we put the smile back on Z’s face.
I like when z was happy
This Was Not expected
Now that’s an ending
I love it😍😍
Incredible.
Oh my

THIS SHOULD HAVE SEEN IN THE OG VIDEO  AND WE GET TO SEE BABY Z OMG
If Q didn't give N the question mark the world will be doomed
alphabet lore chapter 2
The end of this left me in SHAMBLES.  Z did something extraordinary.  Q gave N the question mark.  N was able to change the past... I think?  The good ending happened.  Thank you, Mike.
Z is the best 😃😃😀😀😄😄😁😁😆😆

F f, Q q, N n , Z z is the best letter

The happy ending
Ok this video is way too good. Z is now happy and Z's power is finally revealed, as well as him as un-capital  which was so hecking cute for some reason, F is now friendly. Q now has a power, bulging his eyes out of his head lol, only problem is L,M,O now hate N and F more than they already did. I think it's safe to say that I now know my ABCs.
Big chunky z l o l
Put z in your next episode

Mean while Z: nope is time travel
im crying of how good this is
Absolute masterpiece this should be a full on movie or series on TV
Just wow. It really put everything together. Why Z had the dots and why Q was telling them this. Bravo, Mike, bravo
P x n is not allowed
So what about “Next time won’t you sing with me”?
i thougt the alphabet lore was ended but "Now i know my F and N next time dont kill someone" that should be the goodest ending😌😌😌

Очень крутая история вроде просто буквы ABC.. но какой сюжет.
N realized F was the only one who was nice to him, so he took his side, i forgive N for killing F since he fixed it
O yeaaaa
now we know that lowercase z isn't a burning hot lava
YA KNOW THIS IS THE BEST ENDING IVE SEEN I NEVER SEEN z WOW
FC d ii f
I waited for this :D
the happiest ending we all needed.😇
I DINT EXPECT A NEW ENDIN-
I like to imagine a whole other story from beginning to end from n and f becoming bestest of friends to L and O being the true villains.
F's genuine crooked smile made my heart implode, rebuilt, and explode again in the span of a second
Wait a minute if that is the ending than was there ever a lore?
Make the neutral ending pls where N dies BUT O beats up F
nice ending
😌
This is Good ending
SO CUTEEEEEEE❤

this version has more big eyes for the characters and the ending we need
Awwwww so cute
Yay a good ending that's so nice to have it

OH MY GOD LOWERCASE Z!

WE WANT NUMBERS LORE NEXT!!
OMG YESSS
So basicly N went back in time for F to be happy and endend it all now F will not kill them?
YES! ALPHABET LORE PART 2!
Great. Now make Chess Lore. Making the pieces say their names is weird, make them say accurate english! For example, (King: It's castling time!) or (King: CHECK/CHECKMATE!) or (Pawn: EL PASSANT!!!) or (Chess Teacher/Coaching: Now that it's time to set up the board/rematch, let's set up the pieces/put the pieces back in place!) And the chessboard is the planet.
HERE COME THE SHIPPERS😟
Z didnt cry anymore , now he smile
F story was sad but z travel back intime in baby size and q but the ? In n mouth he see back too baby size and save f but l and o are mean so n think f the bestfriend is was a sad now ir a true happy ending i love it
Before we felt so empty to know of ending but now the good ending have been fullfilled We simply felt completed Sheer respect for such amazing work
YES! This came!  Bonzo!
baby z
🙂
next time wont you sing with me…
Awwwwwwww

1:33 pee crystal accived!
이야ㅑㅑㅑㅑㅑㅑㅑㅑㅑ
dude this is sick
The way I cried happy tears actually
Thanks, now the community is gonna ship N and F now, dang it.
Future
Why am I crying
Z lowercase fan made with lava and now it's normal and he looks happy for f n and z
I thought baby z was literally a whole lava thingy. THE. FANARTS. ARE. WRONG.
Yay, I'm all done learning my ABC's, now I just need to know my...           Numbers...
Good end
wow another animation of alphabet lore
im litterally waiting for this
This series has truly been amazing As someone who watched your videos before alphabet lore I can say, this is my favourite thing you’ve done
See F is not evil
this is awsome
Happy ending:)
This is the best way to learn the alphabet.
Great. Now make F eat everything to make F eat Z and fly out of space.
YES
:0
I ligit cried im so glad theres a twist and there's a good ending Theres a theory that Z is evil idky but i like how J is not important bruh has beef with the letter j why Edit: how i have 0 likes
True  ending
THE GOOD ENDING
I LOVE YOU FOR NEW ENDING
this was i good ending😭😭
now THATS  the ending everyone wanted 😇🥰😃
That is how it was supposed to be like
I guess this is The happy ending :)  Edit: MIKE SALCEDO PLEASE VOICE SOUP EARTH SOCIETY’S NUMBER LORE 44 PLEASE
0/10 Ending, didn't see L and O get hit by a train.  Okay but in all seriousness, yeah, it's a nice ending, no real explanation needed. And, "Now I know my ABCs", N now knows about the future revolving around the other members of the alphabet when Z rewinded everything back, sticking with F the full way through, "Next time won't you sing with me?" It's the Alphabet, and a lot of clever things manage to be squeezed in to shift the plot and such, how?
1:55 So now everyone except P hates F and N or are they just gonna come back to them eventually
Epic moves from z and i love how q manages to float the gem to ns mouth
Wow
The end is finally here!
Happy ending for all
Did Z just had a Ring???
F just want friends
im crying its a  good way
Here before this blows up
A cute little z
Dang I thought z's voice gonna be like high pitch but his voice is deep af
Next to the numbers lore :)
the best ending
Bruh things coming soon...
Ah yes finally a good ending
Is a Good Ending😇👼
F finally gets what he deserves
If this is the new past.... Then what would the new future/present look like when there adults?
But z is so cute tbh
To be continued! We need a sequel!
Awwwww ty Z and Q :]
This is cool but its still sad because L and O didn't get punishment for that
1:32 The Ampersand was a beautiful touch.
1:41
Yesterday can I use the book last night 👍
This is the good ending!!
Super gazelle is a glove bookoo set
So stop. And how the planet can grow, logically it should be the same as in the present.
when the yt bots infestation is real
I'm watching this all over again this animation is too good
LES GO HAPPY ENDING
That’s the first time I’ve seen z (not uppercase Z)
What a happy end wait how did he keep the ? How??? Make no sense oh right alphabet lol
Wow
What the hell book
And also F is not gonna be mean and F has N powers
Yes biooooooooooooooo
baby z has been reveald
I tough It arleady ended
Q is the best alphabet in the alphabet lore.
lesgoo
OMG YES YES HAPPY ENDING I AM CRYING SO BADLY
baby Z ??????? or lowercase Z
I hope we will get a sequel but I’m happy what we have
Predicting what will change in the new timeline: F & N are friends and live together now (thankfully). The lmnop Squad still get the gems but I think P will instead protect F&N instead of fighting them, and also N isn't on the team. But who will the new lmox squad fight? I'm guessin they'll still have a rivalry with F&N but i think F won't care that much because he's great friends with N now. Since Q won't get the ? Stone since the ? And ; went back into F&N's bodies, he's just be a normal happier slug. The ones who died and or got injured in the previous timeline will not anymore since F is a good guy now. Z won't be traumatized!
Yes!!It finally came!!!!
btw n and f become friends
Most goodest ending ever New things: -Good ending -lowercase Z -new face on F at the start -utility of ... Gem -the letters became good with F -Z Is happy ;)
We finally got to see baby Z
:) thanks you my loves
Good ending!
holy

WOAH I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT

Welp we need months or years to get number lore or something
Honestly this series deserves to be on Hulu or Netflix
Why is F’s eyes white?
Z has super power that he helps me

nest ending
This isnt good, its straight up wholesome
Ngl his smile kinda creppy
Mom said its my turn to get pinned!

Good ending (Hartwarming)

We are waiting for the 2nd part of the alphabet, but if this had happened at the beginning
Thanks for part 2

What a good ending im about to cry man :_)
There's gotta be one more left. Because the last part of the song is "won't you come and sing with me."
Now good endind :D
Z made good ending
Wow this was an amazing series
Finnaly a good ending we all wanted!
We are waiting for the 2nd part of the alphabet, but if this had happened at the beginning
Finally it's been so long
Awwwwwww sooooo cute
He knew what he must do when he got the stone
Everyone thought baby Z was a molten planet
This might not be the end they might meet different Alphabets of conturies From different universes  Z might meet Joke Z I'm thinking ?thing probably teleport things to or Z might do it
Increíble el final:o
This ending was so good  The ending isn't complicated  But also insanely sad
Omg ahhahahahahaha
If u pause at 1:28 and slow it u can see F with no F the upper thing
wait did anyone see the part that P help N get up that was just like the part that F help him
yay good ending
Now we have official lowercase Z
It the good ending.
finally happy planet z!
So Zs power is to reverse time and aftertime I'm right k
f and ni- word what a great friend
Guys look at this part 1:32 - 1:33 this is & mark right??
One thing i realized... F HAS A NORMAL WALK CYCLE NOW
I can't stop cry about that this is horrible 😭😭😭😭 z look cute❤️❤️
Z being able to reverse time is cool
And they lived happily ever after
before :bad ending... after :good ending!
friendly ending
on 1:00 G WASNT A SMALL LETTER or maybe hes the oldest
Finally we saw lowercase z
WOAH
I never thought they would make a finale of the Alphabet Lore.  After that flashback, they realized that F just wanted friends and they felt bad. Z tried to fix everything back to the things they were. I don't know if Z went to the past, but after that, instead of n hiding, n stood up for f.  Now everything's back to normal. But I think they're going to be in the past for awhile. I'm happy everything's back to normal. f and n are friends again. What's adorable is that they got beat up, but they were still happy, and the fact that we saw z.  Edit: I realized that Q shoved the Question mark at N.
Awww that was so sad but I like it though 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Finally added z...
Good ending
The “p” s kiss to “n” was too cute  Love it😍
We NEED MORE ALFABET LORE
Finally the good ending
Secret ending
THANK YOU MY MAN
Make one where F comes back and hugs everyone
Oh my god that was some fresh air
Ngl Q in the thumbnail just looks like a God
Bro this is good!
Nobody noticed on the lowercase G isnt lowercase on 0:59
Best ending
I love how all gems ecxept the period, the comma, the colon and the asterisk appear in this timeline, just to spite L and O.
Well you're not going to leave it for now
OMG its finally released
Wow
AWWWWWWW THATS AMAZING
Good ending:yay
I’m literally crying right now. This is so wholesome. 😭
wow😨
YAY GOOD ENDING!!!

F,N Gang 👇
Good and sad ending
FINALLY WE KNOW WHAT BABY Z LOOKS LIKE
So F just wanted his freindx back but he's dead

Good Ending Serice and Best Ending Final
A great alternative ending, perfectly
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BABY Z

The real ending
We need the continuation for this.

Wiat F and N changed gems
Wait the ? Mark moves if Q is moving he's eYeS?!?!
this is enough to make a grown man cry

OMG LOWERCASE Z IS BACK: a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
prt 2 pls and qlso thanks for making this
oh wow
Or the third phase of aplhabet
The true ending : n saves f
Bad news is ppl will posts F and N ships
L and O are the actual Antagonists
So make part 2 of epiloge
3 hrs ago
DEAR MIKE SALCEDO PLS OH PLS make this the Aplhabet has 3 phase 1 get to know alphabet 2 u know the alphabet 3 u now understand it ok 1 left u need to understand the aplahbet the last one
This makes me sad
Is this the end?
Z is most powerful alphabet
This fr made me cry..anybody else?  It would’ve been cooler if they grew up and they wanted to take revenge on L and O. Am I rite or wrong? (No offense don’t be ashamed-)
:)
Z baby
mike missed a trick here by not having i go off with f and n, it could have ended with them spelling 'fin'
good ending
The good ending
0:11 - 0:32 gave me shivers up my spine
Ya know z is god (or planet I don’t know) that he can reversed time where someone have a chance to change bad thing to good thing
i love how B is still alive
2:02 baby z
Can I just say that was with a doubt the most beautiful happy ending I have ever seen. I honestly did not expect this to happen but now I glad I did. At long last F and N can finally be true best friends and all the events in the series can officially be put to peace. We should thank Z especially, he managed to finally use his power to fix everything and thus bring in the happy ending we have been waiting for. So the tale of A-Z can finally be put to peace, and it looks like we officially learned our ABC’s after all. Thank you Mike for such an amazing series.
1:17 Gosh why F face just look so goofy and cute at the same time 😭👌
👍
I ❤❤❤❤❤❤ u
So that is what baby z looks like
:)
감동
WE FINLREY SEE LOWERCASE Z
This actually warmed my heart... :(
너무좋아
Please make the behind the scene of the alphabet lore
This would be a great ending for the original one, FINALLY F has ONE *TRUE* FRIEND after all these years. Everyone is happy, F and N are friends, but Q is the one who made this all happen, without Q, Alphabet Lore wouldn’t be like this. So technically F N and Q are friends, *best* friends.
The Lore is more even deeper
you finally made it cute z
That Q got a TRUCE
Dis is a real finale?
Yis
Where am i
Now the whole Number lore changes
блин какой конец нет никого конца можно продлжения про буквы пжпжпжпж
LOL f u n y spelled funy
z is chunky noice
GOOD Ending : Z is happy F & N are (F)rei(n)ds    Bad Ending : F Got revenge And N Didnt Beacome his freind and Baby z Sad
I love that all end we need 🖤
z
This guy deserves all the Oscars in history, present and future

YAY THAT WAS A GOOD ENDING
It's a good ending
No no no continue
Yay
The thumbnail says fun and Gay
can we see the final please
Finally the good ending
F❤N     f❤n
If that was the real final fpr alphabet lore, why was F evil, even with N?
If all the letters cried they make tons of superpower gems?
I hope people don’t milk this
I love this video

Good ending ;)
This is the good ending
Good ending

That was all we needed
LOWERCASE Z??  I LOVE THIS SO MUCH imagine g's reaction to 1:50
Love how everyone is talking about how N stopped being a coward and helped f,        BUT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT LOWERCASE Z-
a good ending 😊😊😢😢
what an awesome ending of the story
I want to see the grown version of F and N eachother
Good ending :)
Well I needed this ending forever
THANKS FOR THE PIECEFUL ENDING
2003
YAYYYU

Happy end?
FINALLY THERE IS LOWERCASE Z!!!
Good ending :)
Q with dark magic
Good job Mike salcedo
3 hours ago yes I'm early
Atleast F and N can be happy even they are hated
I hope theres a season 2 where Z isnt the universe
I love how smooth the animation is in this one, shows how this is the true ending of the story.
YAYYYYYYY F MY FAVORITE LETTER IS ALIVE:D
Imagine that they looked at f and they said: we just kill f for nothing
0:24 why Q give eat ? with N?
ok, forget g x p n x p
I think N is a bit younger than them all so before any 4 year old ships N and P, P  just gave him a little aunt’s kiss!
I love how l and o just smacking f and n but f and n are just both happy
FN ❤️ fn
I have been waiting for this
The Ending we Needed.
I- I- I have no words- This. Is. AWESOMEEEEE!!!   (also at the 1:49 when P just smooched N was adorable :DDD)

Why did that hit so hard
yay Z is happy know (: happy ending
perfect ending!!!!!!!!!!! I knew that it could not end so badly
It’s not done yet we need the “next time won’t you sing with me” part
and that should get "Oscar"
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This is so happy! We gotta thank Z for saving this! I love that n isnt a coward now! AND z  IS SO FRICKIN CUTE
I think I just realized N got control because Q gave him the Question Mark then it went back in time from Z so N got the chance to revert the damage and turn F into a good letter.   *This comment now has lore lol*
BABY Z
I like q have white eyes
This series has a perfect lore
ALPHABET 2
I love alphabet lore so much

AWWWW THIS IS SO COOL AND SAD AND GOOD AND HAPPY AAAAA!!! 😁😁
:’)
Omg now this all makes sense!
More
Yes yes yes finale good end
omg this is just the best ending  thank you i didn't expect this
So beautiful 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Baby z was so cute and he is still the universe
Cool I hate L and O
Question: if that happened and then at the future they are still friends?
I LOVE THAT
THE GOOD ENDING YES!
yay extra alphabet lore
what will happen when they grow up?
wow…
Happy ending:)
Do number lore
now i wanna see when they become adults again (after the epilogue)
DAMN I WOULD REALLY LIKE ALPHABET LORE 2, where it would cover the alternate ending of F and N being friends
Finally we have the good ending
F i N
The way that n Was kind is 101%
FINALLY LOWERCASE Z
2:02 true lowercase z
Yes
LOVED IT THANKS! Will you also drop a part 3? (I dont think so but still asking bcz we NEED it) (Just realized its a finale rn lol)
Go secret ending
AWWW
Noice
this is good ending
I'll called it Good Ending.
This is so sad 😢😢😢🥺🥺
good ending z can finally sleep in peace
❤😊  And it’s good
I just want a 2 part with this video ;)
f got his happy ending: instead of being the bad guy alone, now he's... still the bad guy but with n ....lul
I just love how P gave N a little kiss when N hugged her
this aphlabet lore its so cool to the end like amphibia
:)
GOOD END
I truly love this! Thank you, Mike!😅
Yoooooo it’s z as a kid
I cried at the end
@Mike Salcedo good job making z!
The last part made me cry
What about J...? (No hate)
the quick kiss from p is so cute 🥰🥰
So THAT’s what Z’s gems do! Also I thought baby z was a red hot z shaped planet getting hit by rocks (like in a planet’s formation)
No way😳
I see secret F is not dead
New  ending  l and o are good and did not interfere with friends and everything was good and better than in this ending
Good ending
Dang I loved this, this was soo damn cute
is beautiful
So Z reversed all the events of the original part, and made N live with F in the cave, which L and O didn’t want, so D, E, I, R, And S don’t get kidnapped, C, J, H, P, X and F don’t die, And L, M, N, O, P, Q, And X do not get the gems, and now Z is happy because the events didn’t happen . Am I correct?
Now we need an alphabet lore 2 if this actually happened. So, F becomes a good guy and becomes best friends with N. The bad guys will be L and O. When N becomes Ñ then F and N switch powers because both of them switched, as you see in 1:28 .
Good ending

1-100
I LOVE THIS ENDING AAAAAAHHAHAHAHAHAAAAA AWWWW
f and n best friends
the perfect ending
✊✊✊👍👍👍
The Saddest movie i watch
Now we know what baby z looks like
OMG  is the ? used to time travel!
I never thought this would end in such a happy ending! This is incredible!
MY THEORY WAS TRUE! Z restarts the universe with his ability at the end, and the cracks in his body are him eventually going insane watching the horrific scenes and forcing them to replay hoping them to change. Now that things have changed, Z has no more cracks in his body, is smiling, and there are no more tears. (I also predicted this ending) The ending we all waited for
After for 2 months we finally saw the happy ending.
I just finished the first one now Omw to finish this
I was crying while watching this
what happen
This actual real gold and a cool epilogue
*the happy ending*
The best part about this is that we finally know Z's true power: rewinding time
True sąd
Good ending
Honestly the plot twist we knew was happening just not how but we all needed . Justice has been met
i cannot speak xd
Now good ending
At least we got a good ending now
I love this end
1:57 z
1:12 Universal Theme 2.0 be like:
Baby Z founding
this is so wholesome i cried
g be like : AYO ARE YOU CHEATING WITH ME
Amazing
This truly warmed my heart
Это было так неожиданно, казалось бы что всё закончилось на грустной нотке и последняя буква Z ничего не сможет сделать, просто наблюдать за происходящим... Но оказывается он всемогущее всех остальных живущих на нём самом, контроль времени и пространства это нечто.
we need a qwerty version
BABY Z ;O
This is the best ending this should be given a reward or smth
Next time won't you sing with me...
0:10 HOW WAS F HERE WHEN HE’S DEAD?!?
wait is that baby Z?!
Basically the Happy Ending
I needed this
Hi look a saad
It's all thanks to Z/z and Q/q 😊
That's a sad store
F & N is Good boys and L & O is bad guys now we love to you.
Q has a power?!
YES
The hole ahplabet lore and this happend to me
hi
This is better than most movies
Show me more of BABY Z I LOVE HIM
THAT WAS SOOO CUTE
THIS IS SO WHOLESOME AND ADORABLE, MAN GOT ME HYPED (Also does that mean that there will be a different/alternative future for them too? Like, when they grow up in this one, they'll become nice to F and N thanks to P probably? Like, she'll tell them that they'e actually nice and all, and more probably!)
Poor F
happy ending!!!!!😭😿🙁😞😟😢😥
Yay btw this guy is the real guy who made alphabet lore
Finally i saw how z was a baby lol 1:57
So happy
OMG
This is a butifull 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is the last episode of alphabet lore! It happens AFTER the flashback!
And for those that said that Z couldn’t do anything they take the big L
We all needed this it’s great to see a happy ending for F
First time ⏰ when we see z small
My boi Z became my favorite
wow a new sub...good animated they are cute🥹
:)
tell me if ytbrs wach this
This is a happy ending
The ending is so sad😭
Pls make number lore

Baby z
I love this ending i cried for u adding in series bad ending now u added good ending i m happy for F and N😄
First, people think Z on lowercase is magma but dont you know Second, BRO IS SMALLER
this is so emontinal that i cryed
did i reload my page corretly or I just saw 10K likes but with 5K views?
P kissing killing me off
Me: 😟😞😔😢😥😭😭😭😭😭😭😓 My friend that doesn't know alphabet lore:  👁️👄👁️
The end
i never expected this. it was so cute 🙁💗 im crying now  edit (10/27/23): kill me.
End
I love the happy ending when Z changed the past and n and f become friends and f didnt become evil i wonder what will happen after n and f become friends and this is the good alphabet animation  in the world
This is Cool now The Good Ending  and Bad Ending i love it
Now there is only one question remaining... What happens when they grow old? Also does only N know what could've happened if he didn't help F? Either way, the whole alphabet lore series is amazing!
The true ending we need
Z
Good Ending
Wait. What, OHHHHHHH. time for an explanation.       As they realize how this all came to be, the rest of the alphabet sees rings around the sky. Q instantly gives N the ? gem. As Z sets backs time, n changes the moment f felt resentful. As he has become no longer that coward he was. As n finally walks to f, o and l punch n and f, as they get injured.     Before they leave to the cave, n gives p a hug. Knowing the good things she will do in the future for him. As n and f look down, upon every alphabetical person, they feel at peace. And THIS folks. Is the GOOD ending. True may not be sweet, but true make never be sweet. That’s my message for you today.
Great
I almost cried
0:10 Z's true power
Good Ending But Number Lore
Plz make a part three I love althabet lore make a part 3 if u can
10/10
Oh my… Such an awesome epilogue to a very emotional story… Congratulations once again…

Hmmm so "..." gives powers over time
THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
I cried. Someone cried too cuz this ending was incredible
The Finale.
That is amazing
Z : not need thank
Lowercase Z found
true ending with disaster beyond the past and attempting everything was a shame, but the story never ends in such a tiny place.. it may seems that this is the epilogue of the story.. but if you think more of it three dots in fornt of the word epilogue
This made me so happy and now know what Z looks like as a child..!
Happy ending :)
Bro this got me having tears of joy in my eyes
WOW

Perfect ending.... peacefully
NOW THAT'S DA TRUE ENDING YEEAAHHH!!!!!!

I like this lowercase design of z. Now fans will not go mad like “well maybe Z is N but after knowing the truth because if it was a planet. Then the other letters will not have existed because it would have needed to get formed!”
Good f good n

I got a tear in my eye at the end of this story. Looking forward to the sequel.  👀
I love how G was still portrayed as an obstacle against n, even though all g and p did in nZ was make out.
OMGGGG WE WERE WAITING FOR THIS
I love how the lowercase Z showed up.
When the ending changes, the face of Z also changes.
Thank you for the good ending, I finally am happy now 👍

LMO: N needs to come with us N: NO WAY! F: Please stay with me! N: *thinking* N: L & O You bullied me so im staying with F! F: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Z: IT WORKED! 22 years later F: Okay N you stay here I'm gonna kill L and O. M: Maybe we're the bad ones O: YOUR SERIOUS?! L: O your banned! We shouldn've bullied N and F O: DID YOU JUST UNFRIEND ME?! LM: Yep P: Actually I'm leaving bye! M: WAIT WHO GAVE YOU THAT?! P: N Did. 2 months later M: I feel bad for F now N: WHY DID I KILL HIM?

Hey Mike make this of part 2

The perfect ending
Are this to The movie
atcully 150 back

EPIC THE BEST END I SEE IN ALL MY LIFE
Finally a happy ending we all needed ❣
Omg Im crying bc this is sooo good!! 😭😭😭
We found the ending we wanted and needed
Now THATS a good ending
Okay I thought this was actually from another person, BUT SHIT ITS ACTUALLY HERE?!?!
I FOUND THE BEST PART 2
so this is the real end
BABY Z    BABY Z
WE GET TO SEE LOWERCASE Z IN THE END YOOOOO
I’m getting goosebumps this is amazing
Good ending🎉
IM SO HAPPYYYY🥹
Even though N and F Are hated together (except P and G) They lived happily ever after
look at the little baby.                                        now look at the big baby..:   Z
OMG!! Z and Q doing AMAZING Back there!! It's like They doing a Teamwork to make things Right ,even Q is too late to warn everyone Z was there too help too,Z use his Jewels  too go back to the past and Q give his jewel too N ,and now N is going back to the past with Q jewels so he look to his self saw himself young and see F on the ground lying and Fear of sadness and now N have his chance to save F and too prove his not a Coward and also to save the rest off the letter's especially P.
Z’s power explained: Z uses his tears to go backwards 0:10 Time gets reversed 0:10 Shadows are reversed 0:18 World turns blue 0:10 - 0:26 Time goes back to younger ages 0:26 Z turns younger - End of video
Omg
I'm so happy
Is it just me or did it feel weird that Q moved his eyes like that?
0:22 kyoo
this is so cute i almost cried
Finally. Everything was OK once again
WE FINALLY GET TO SEE LOWERCASE Z
HAPPY ENDING
I feel like the characters being small letter when they were  little is a nice touch.
Good ending
Good ending
awww
YIPPEE
LOWERCASE Z
The ending we really needed 😃  Also baby z just- 😍
It's cute nice did the best f n friend together
Z is soo cute:3!
This video is made by the alphabet lore maker named mike salcedo
n came back for f
finally we get to see more of Z
Thanks for showing baby z
the ending is ok but feels a bit overrated  (plz no toxic in the replies)
Q is starting to be one of my favorites, and he's the reason why N and F are friends
The good ending ! In the end, the heroes are : Z that was able to rewind time to before F betrayal, Q who realized what  was happening and gave N the "?" to help N make the good decision in the "new" past. And finally baby N that take this good decision.
Amazing and I thought at first it was just a fan made but until i checked the person that made this and everything made sense. First I was confused until I remembered that Z is literally the planet so he gave N a second time but this time N would stand up for F. Because if it ends on a bad ending that means there is a good ending.
That’s so cute
Now im cr____
This is real Alphabet lore happy ending
Sleep now z you need it
Happy ending
so cool! ;)
We always wondered what Z looks like in lowercase
This is the abc's we should be teaching kids XD
Omgggg is very cool end of alpha lore
Epic, N is time traveler with ? and … gem.
Z IS HAPPY
YAHOOOO
Peaceful Ending
FINNALLY LOWERCASE Z HAS BEEN REVEALED!!
thank you for this satisfying ending honestly I thought you were just going to leave it at that F was going to be alone but thanks to you I know I'm satisfied with the story🥰🤗😊😊😊😁😁😁❤🧡💛💚💙💜
😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰
This… beautiful 🥹
0:24 CURSED EYES
We need to see what its like in the future now.
What A Good Ending
Happy ending
THEY MADE BABY Z CANON
Yes happy ending !
Good ending hey can you make number lore
who would’ve thought that a show like this would have such a happy ending
More lore to the alpabet lore!
N❤F
Perfect end
i love good endings and now i'm glad it's a good ending
after everyone sees the past everyone became sad and felt terrible for f since he died and z decided to use his power to reverse time and q gave n the question mark so n can remember everything and the time gets reversed to the time when f trips on n and n immediately look at o and gets the flashback where o hits n and he looks at L and gets the flashback where l makes fun of him and n look at f and gets a flashback where f comforts n then n looks down and remember the time where everyone called n a coward n becomes determined and do what it needs to be done so everything in the future would be correct so n walks toward f but g tries to stop him but n doesn't give but L and o tries to stop him but n still doesn't give up so n walks up to f and protect him l ,m and o are confused then f become happy but L and o decided to hit them but they both are still happy and n helped f stands up helped him get back to his lair and they make g trip and n goes and hug p for comforting in the future and n cries out the ! symbol and p kissed him then n including f goes to f's lair and they both remains as a friend and z became happy and fall asleep after a everything is right
I LOVE THIS ENDINGG
Good ending
YES GOOD ENDING
Cool n and f and q

Thank you for the good ending Mike Salcedo ❤️
I wanna see how did this affect the future
Lowercase z lookes kinda cute
good ending : you help F.
FrieNds
We wanted this ending,
The Good Ending, Indeed
True ending discovered, very wholesome and underrated
You can’t spell “Friends” without F and N.
Isnt z supposed to be lava
0:24 Q has goofy ahh eyes lol  Edit: HOLY CRAP 200 LIKES
I love it
LOWERCASE Z
👏👏👏👏🤳🤳
F needed N to FUNCTION (FN). Such a beautiful story...
🥺🥺
…
Z is the cutest tbh
Good ending :D
now thats an good ending
it happened
Thanks for epilogue
ඞ
The final is beautifull good work salcedo
This was absolutely awesome, but knowing history was changed, now I'm kinda curious to see how those changes affected the future, I feel there's a lot of potential for more Like how N and G could become enemies as N hugged P, G's love interest Or how N could help F reunite F-R-I-E-N-D-S I feel there's potential for a season 2, but the choice is up to you Mike.
Why this It's drama
YAAAAAS
what next
We needed this
Masterpiece  I wonder what's next
z's REVEAL
Z and z
very happy😊
Sad too 😞
:0
Chapter 2 trailer guys?
2:08 the end
Alright we now need what happens when f was good.
Question: WHY DOES Z AND T HAS THE SAME TEETH
happy ending + canon lowercase z= perfect!!!
AND SUB
this universe is like no other but creative with a simple premise like the alphabet I am so glad this got popular
Now we all waiting for the "next time wont you sing with me"
Yes new video and good the end
The good ending
That was so cool it made me cry! I wonder what would happen next... And nobody notices  that F is in the volcano if you pause correct
THATS SO COOL 1 LIKE FOR F N ARE COOL AND EVERYONE AND Z
Wunderful ♥
I never knew the alphabet lore could have such an ending.
🎉🥺nf
its rewind time
Z went made in heaven
N is now brave
It would have been better if L and O got their just desserts
So it looks like to make z not cracked u needed n to not betray F
Ngl, a bit sad F and N left the alphabet :( But at least F and N remain friends TvT. I almost sobbed
Normal ABC: Now I know my ABC's Alphabet Lore: *N O W  I  K N O W  M Y  A B C ' S*
now make the kther alohabets like the russian,epsanol,turkic,greek or ancient
make number lore
They dont care when they get beat up by the bullies they are smiling, how wholesome can it get
2hours later after my comment it came
YAY
All those times when people said Z can't do anything... and now it is changed
Bagus
Good ending

If it was a leap year, February would've had 29 days which meant there would be "Next time won't you sing with me"
E
F didn't do anything wrong
MORE❤
Thank you Z for Using Your Power Wisely
Dd
i love this pls do more i will sub to you ty for this
I have been waiting for this one this is cool!
OMG it's a paradox
Sad ending : F got killed and that Z was crying so badly  Good ending : We all got to see Z's baby form plus he was super happy and cute. No sad things, no one has to cry. Well except tears of joy. Well we also got to know z's gem (...) Power  Edit: I think in the future , They will live happily ever after and F wouldn't kill anyone🙂
Is there a sequel?
0:14 boi turned into saturn lol

0:25 N: GUHG KYO WAT DA FU-
Now we need a “Next time won’t you sing with me?" But it most likely will never happen
good ending
So I thought z would just be a still forming planet but.. we get that instead.
I js have a feeling that maybe... Q was waiting for this day a life long? Z uses the dots from his tears to send a message to Q and Q uses question mark whenever he sees the lights. Maybe this were planned by Q and Z? Idk js maybe? I also have a feeling that Z and Q is a duo of the most importnant characters literally in the whole entire story. They literally planned for this and waited literally a life long!!👁️👄👁️
this perfect ending
Good
Never in my WILDEST dreams did I expect a sequel/alternate ending of this
Why do they look so traumtized after the past...?
wat program do you use to animate alphabet lore
love 😘😘🥺🥺😢😢👏👏👏👌
I was sleeping in the scene when he was chained

N he's remember everything the pass of time because Q he did give to N after Z reset the time before F got bully by L and O and before those two block N From towards F  And after that N he's not a coward anymore he got everything he knows from ? Crystal
that was a beautiful animation , i might cry
Nah I fr thought this is the one time the bad ending wins but guess I was wrong
Finally Z is now pucci
Yeesssiirrr
Now F and N back to be friends forever
z IS SO CUTE
pls Do Number Lore:The Series But 0 Is The Villain
Perfect
Both of them look cute
yay
the good ending!
Pls continue part 3
Yes f will not die and kill the others
Ending of friendship
Baby z 2:04
Also guys, Details you may have missed in the video:  - I realized that L and O still didn't get the revenge that they deserved, bec they still punched both F and N when they're going to his cave.  Also, I just realized that F and N created an ampersand (&) with the question mark and semicolon combined, which is a very true detail that they are always BFFs.  And I love how Z reversed the time back to fix everything what N did and Q quickly gave N the question mark gem again to ensure that he remembers everything. And I love the design of lowercase Z. He's so cute!  Edit: The ellipsis gem was used similarly in grammar. It was supposed to make a sentence complete. And Z has done it. He made the entire series complete because of the gem. As a summarization, this was a happy ending to both F and N...
And then they live happily ever after...
What a happy ending
is f gonna be alive
This very good ending  n ❤️f
The 3 Points Dissaper Because He Didnt Cry Yet...
I want watch it everytime again. Great job mike

Best Friends Ending
OMG ITS REAL BABY Z!
Wow new episode
The best deep lore animation yet
F love N
Happy ending
Now we need season 2
Honestly. I was expecting N to reveal to everyone that L and O had made F spell Frick, since he was now in possession of the Question Mark stone. But I think it was pretty heartwarming seeing him and F instead deciding to live in the cave together as friends, without F becoming the murderer he is today.
So the series Was n that sees the future
Beautiful just beautiful
I LIKE IT ❤❤❤❤
Z was the god and changed the world
10/10 ending i love it
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
2 PART
FINALLY THERE'S A LOWERCASE VERSION OF Z!!!!!!!!!!
😊
:)
THIS CANT END HERE NOO!! We need a comeback!!!
Yo
Finally.............. It's & and lowercase z
happy ending:)
To like the over one we’re he does die or maybe in season two he doesn’t what I mean is the one where he is evil
finally z's lowercase form.
Good mini z oh my god
ok now make a diffrent video
wait wha- is this a secret video?

Yes, we got the true ending. I love it.
MOREEE
I LIKE SO MUCH THIS END THANKS YOU
the good ending
I still need moreeee what happens in the future 😣😖😫😫😫
I’m so glad F made up with N and everything is back to normal.
Next time won’t you sing with me…
6.4k views 11k likes?, i think im the one that has high ping
This is the ending we really need
HOLY COW 2 HOUR AGO THIS IS SO COOL
is good ending
this was all we needed
1:49 my heart just melted😭❤️🅿️
I've read novels, watched movies and heard stories and this was a way better story than all of them. Bravo.
In the End, Z started and ended it all, he did reverse physics. I like how lowercase p kissed n so cutely- z IS SO CUTE! And I like how he sleeps to recreate his sound. Also ; + ? = & = Ampersand, the true final letter.
this is how l and o is good and f didn't became evil
1:32 the & symbol! Edit: wow Above 50 likes
Woah… hold on…  When F and N made the Question Mark and Semicolon again… it made the ampersand (&) mainly used for “and”. If it then meant to say “F & N”… was this entire time the question mark not meant for Q…  But for F?  EACH GEM MATCHES THE COLOR OF THE LETTER GIVEN!!!  P (who is pink) and the Pink Exclamation Mark  M (who is red) and the Red Coma  L (who is green) and the Green Period  O (who is blue) and the Blue Colon  N (who is orange) and the Orange Semicolon  X (who is white) and the White Asterisk (well I guess it like a pinkish purple but whatever)  If the question mark was meant for Q it would’ve been the same color… but it wasn’t…    HOLY CRAP   (This is just a thought…       Just A Theory! A Letter Theory! Thanks For Watching!)
This is 2 part I know that because After ? Z go all letters to past and end with a happy ending :D PD: the video say the finale
Let's goo
2:02 BABY Z CONFIRMED?!?!?
YAY
So F actually lived, all because Q said KYOOOOOOOP🤪
Dang its been a year and this is sad
shipping 101
Good end :
Aw yeah so cool
How cute
Z MVP
Z's "..." power is to reverse time
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oh wait at the end it's the REAL baby z.
Honestly I preferred the ending before; don't get me wrong this one is good, it just feels forced. All the other punctuation powers made sense with what they did (";" connected two things together, "." Stopped things, etc) but how does ellipses reversing time make sense? Maybe the time-reversal came from something else, I dunno, it just feels much less polished and thought-out as the rest of the story...
This series has been a spectacular story to, not only watch, but, to experience, as well.  Thank you for bringing this journey about the ABCs.
well the f and n and z is happy ending ♥
YAYY GOOD ENDING
finally young z
F did do nothing
Baby z is cute
I legit almost cried didn't but it was close
So sad

please make more about alphabet lore alphabet lore is so cool
This is the best series ever, MCU has its competitors.
Finally a good enging
the ending we needed
It’s so sad I feel like there needs to be a season 2
The True ending about alphabet lore
Finally the part 2 of the series
İm happy n stayed with f that is what i call a true friendship!
Although L and O getting away, but remember the rest of the alphabets that called by O (A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J, K, M, R, S, T, U, V, W, X and Y) just witnessing L and O decided to kick out F and N after the payback toward F was failed.  And i was thinking, what just happened to the rest of F's tears (. , : * ) after F and N entered back to the cave? Are those tears gonna automaticly recieve it toward L, M, O, X again or what? I bet there's gonna be a sequel after that.
we finally have a baby z
Chef’s kiss
This is...                                    THE MOST INCREDEBOLE ANIMATION IN THE WORLD ,  you need to do another part ;begging like n and f are tall , and the other leters doesn't like then, that will be gratfull. If you read this(maybe not)pls do another part pls :(
😢👌🏻🤗🇵🇾
FINALLY FROM ALL THAT GAIN, WE FOUND THE LOWERCASE Z! 😭

man when I saw him explaining what was going on I was like, wow now everything makes sense
we need a sequel!! :D
Next season L and O should be villain
Good ending
This actually made me almost cry
:0
Idk if anyone noticed this but at 0:04 it seems that's R is dead, mabye I'm looking into much but it seems weird that all the other letters have their eyes closed while R's eyes are open, anyway this ending is so much more satisfying than the other one.
Now that i think about it,N could've passed next to G/F to save either P or C
and everyeting is normai
wow good ending
"Lower case Z"
wow
Kinda anticlamatic but ok
i knew ... had something to do in the future
This made my day,thank you. ✌🏻
lowercase z revealed (pure happiness)
haroshi final

Best ending
So baby  l and o was a bully so how they become hero when they grow up

MASTERPIECE
and my give z
1:51
Why lowercase z
5k views and 10k likes lol
P is such a loving character
Happy Ending!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love this ending so much, I also love how at the last beats of the video actually mean”now I know my abc’s, won’t you come and sing with me.” Just like in the alphabet song, those lyrics on the beats are the same last lyrics from the original song.  I LOVE N,F AND Q. I felt like they played a big part in this story that mr mike salcedo has made.  MIKE, IF YOUR READING THIS, I LOVE YOUR WORK. Keep it up
yes good ending
Mike will make number lore now :)
do number lore but make it different ok
good ending. Finally a good ending
Yeeees justice
Season 2 is coming soon!
Yes
Lower case z now there is no more fanmade of lowercase magma lookin z and i also like the title Now i know my ABCs…
This really warmed my heart
Yes one of the sadest and best endings i seen so far 😢😃
Now everyone knows small Z
Yay i can see z in lowercase
this puts a smile on my face
The real ending 😊
we did it, we finally found child z
Oh thank God lol. I've had to deal with edgerunners ending for the past few days, despite how amazing it was
I actually wasn't expecting this at all, and I was supposed to make a comic out of this with a good ending, but holy crap, this is so awesome! The best send-off of the series! Great job Mike, and you deserve to get Zs now after this!
Now we need to make a bad ending
good ending:N saves F bad ending:O AND L made the wored f-r-i-c-k
the ending we all needed
This is a Masterpiece and a Ending we need.   Edit : Moral of the story : A true friend in need is a friend indeed
thank you Q
I'm not crying, you are!  Btw beautiful ending! I almost cried-
Q y Z lo hicieron!!! :D
Did not expect this But WE HAVE A LOWERCASE Z NOW
Wow z revrseed time
Q took that long just to give us the best ending ever
This is one of the best endings I've seen in my whole life. Instead of being F going to his cave alone, as in the original one,  N accompanied him. This is all thanks to Z, which I didn't know would have such an important role.
THE TRUE ENDING WOOO
I’m confused that do the alphabets live on Z or is it an illusion?
Amazing.
BABY Z AAAAAAAAAAAA HES/SHES SO CUTE
yes it finally here
LOWERCASE Z!!!! This is amazing, Everything about it!
good ending
THIS MEANS C IS ALIVE
man i didnt know were gonna see lowercase Z this ending is much better than the old one

*Buenísimo!* 😍👍
holy
Do the alphabet lore again but put this in the video
Good ending
I call this a good ending
good ending be like : WOOOOOO
Good ending
I’m crying from this this is so butuful😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Yey
The end is F and N is have nice life 😂😂😂
1 person made alphabet lore but good ending but no need for that since you did it!
The last ending didn't really make any sense. But this, this makes alot more sense
Da baby z tho
bro, thats what i was looking for this. is. PERFECT. thank you
Did we except this? No Did we need this? Yes Do we love this? YESSS
🤗
(...) is sometimes used in imported text to show that a paragraph has been cut, this could be interpreted as skipping time and generalised to messing with the timeline.
Alphabet Lore 2: Alphabet and Numbers
Best ending off story 10/10
The Animation is so Good!
F I no longer alone he now has n as his friend
Just image this ending hapen
That was so heartwarming
Finally baby Z!
WOW!
This needs an Oscar award
true ending
Lo  lifes
i cant stop watching this, plz help
goodness gracious
Make part 3 pleas
Omg this is the Best good ending i see
This will be season 2
Mamamia Thanks you for the god ending
Woo! A happy ending!!!!
2278th.
So, the powers of the three blue points is  to time travel back in time(maybe to the creation of the first suspensive point)
Now we know what z looks like when he is a little letter
baby z reveal be like:
As a wise man once said WOOOOOO YEAH BABY, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT WOOOOOOOOOOO
I love it! This was awesome! The ending we all needed. F was framed and misunderstood and everyone sees this but it's too late.. luckily, with the power of Z's (...) ellipsis, he's able to reset time and Q makes sure N remembers this time around since he was too slow last time. n now being q kid again, he didn't care about anything else but to stick by his friend f and they stay peaceful and friends together. Someone will find out it was all l and o's fault anyway, the truth always comes out somehow and if n really wanted to get could show them that (?) Question Mark power which would reveal the truth to everyone. It's amazing how creative you were with these stories and I love it! This is the true ending of f and n and now z can finally be happy and have a peaceful nap. You gotta do more of these! Awesome well done man proud of you!!! 😁👍
Im so glad that Z has become joyful🥰
Let’s goo
Yay a happy ending
the best ending made everyone loves this F needed love not hate
Didn't expect an alternative ending bro...  But this is, this is GORGEOUS!
ONLY 2 LEFT number lore and shapes lore
So did Z reset time and Q quickly gave N the ? And then time reset then N knew what was going to happen so he stands up for F and basically saves everyone a cycle of the world resetting? Well, that’s a sentence now. BUT POG ENDING
1 hour ago great exited to see the reactions
Ending good lucky f and n :)
Alphabet lore: good ending
baller approved
so z got gem when he old and that gem can trune back time
Request Comment  Please create more Alphabet Lore series  For example 【Alphabet Lore of Christmas】
DUDE IM CRYING FINALLY A HAPPY END 😭😭😭
0:22 I like how instead of just using the usual N body, he actually redrew N and Q and it was so smooth
😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
make plushies next time and i really appreciate your work but its the good ending of the alphabet lore they liked if f was good enough to get more popularity and btw if u loved the vid do this:   👇

Good ending
2:07 "Akhirnya aku bisa tidur nyenyak. 😴"
L and O still didnt die
The good ending *the cutest animation ever*
Wow that's awesome
Oh now i realize! Its: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y n Z.  But i realized that "n" means "and" so it would be: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y and Z +the epillogue called "Now i know my ABC".  If you dont get it i mean that its the full ABC song! A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y and Z, now i know my ABCs. If it wasnt intentional then HOLY GOD IM A GENIUS.

So the ellipsis reverses to the past and resumes to the future!
I love a happy ending❤️❤️❤️
I love friendships
2:07 omg lowercase Z this guy deserves a oscar,a nobel and a holy creator award
Yo a real ending?
I shed a tear
Wew
zero idea time travel was possible but here we are!!! ;D
Wow such an big happy ending
A great ending, especially for the F fanbase.  The only way that I can see expanding is if the Alphabet meets another alphabet like Russia's or Greek's.  Again, great job.
Finally, Baby Z original
Ohhhhh So Q Was Gonna Use That Question Mark To Show The Past
YOU ARE LIVED!!!!!!!
WE HAVE A LOWERCASE Z THAT IS CANON!
AND THIS IS ALSO FROM MIKE SALCEDO!!!/
OMG IM SO FREAKING HAPPY RN FINALLY THE VIDEO I WANTED
Z reverse the time and fix everything
When the ending is finally here: *LETS FUUCKKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-*
Aa, ab, ac, ad… The series will continue
The lore was very good and I liked the good ending
Trurly a M-A-S-T-E-R-P-I-(E sibling)-C-(other E sibling)
I think this is the good ending
Ooooooooo
вот это я понимаю хеппи энд :"
Omg wow
"BTW" Bye the way
Me sonra happy iş good end

Good Ending
the ending we wanted, *and* needed.
Yeaaaaaaa
ABCDE
1:37 that was upgraded animating right there
Where alphabet lore anime?? @mikesalcedo
Mike Salcedo the genius of our time
Early people 👇
Please make more that f and n are still friends and f is not evil and please do the entire alphabet lore series but a different one that F is not evil!
New end unlocked: very good ending
I am about to cry of happiness
I tghout this was fanmade but its real lol
I love alphabet lore can you next video
That's A Good Ending!
Look what I got I have a screen shot of this episode not being here
1:25 (pause) cant handle the cuteness frr
Loved it sad to see an ending though (number season 2 possibly)
This is how z looks like in 2:03
finally an sequel mike!!! thanks
We got the ending we all wanted Thanks Z and Q
this is the gay ending
It's a baby z but it's so cool
Damn bro there is a good ending!
dude what did z do when he was younger that made his voice deeper????
g still get stap by f
Everyone: finally F is gone time to relax Z: AND THE RINGS GO BOOM!
UwU
So charming 😢😊
lowercase z
We need a chapter 2 of F and N being villians, but much intense
The true ending :)
Wait... if Z's tears according to some resemble like the ellipsis, are those his powers which can turn back time to solve N's problem with F? Anyways, I really love the finale. With N and F's friendship coming back strong once again, Z went happy now and he's really cute being a lowercase letter.
That is a good ending. But the Best ending is all letters kick L and O ass, not F's
Now We Use Z For The Timeline
FINALLY THE NEW ONe
Get your before 1 hour video old ticket here if it's to late you can also claim your before 1 day ticket here
I did not expect this but this is awesome
Can’t wait for “Next time won’t you sing with me”!
We all thought alphabet lore would end in uspense and with all dead letters. But now Mike Salcedo give us the real finale and (idk even someone else) im really Happy N and F became BFF. And now we also can see baby Z. True masterpiece
Now it no more that ending it now the "good ending" F is no more the bad guy and N is not a coward
Omg is cool absolu
I wanna beat up L and O so badly 🤤
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 the best :) ending ever BTW baby z is cute
This make me cry😭😭😭😄
Good end
I thought time travel isnt real,turns out it is.
Wow the final WAS AWESOME
All baby
Yes! This is great!
This time everyone has to hurt L and O
Its a happy end?
but what will happen when they come in capital letters? what will they do in their life?
Something interesting to consider, if the “…” powers are time rewinding, how many times has all this happened before Q was finally able to give N the “?”?
what the
Happy ending
Finally theres a lowercase z now
This is an absolute masterpiece pleace do more alphabet lore videos.,:;!? (Edit) i did all of the gems by the way
2:05 even Z is now z
hsjdfhajqHJDSKWRVSHDBJSHWaehrjqehegwfehjbasHJSAKDVFHADJGFSH MIKEEE IM CRYING AND SCREAMIGN I LOVE THISS!!!!!!
best friends forever
Very wholesome ending!
Oscar for you
Please do more alphabet lore
Why ded ai si
จบ😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😁
2:03 z finally revealed
Finally, the good ending that we deserved! I really needed more alphabet lore. Keep up the good work, Champ!
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy i want it to continue plssssssssssss
Now there are two options, a good ending and a bad ending
Good end
z when he was little he was so cute
Ну это конец. И СПАСИБО ЗА ХОРОШИЙ КОНЕЦ!!!!!!!!!!😀😄😃😀😄😀😃
AND THE BEST MOST REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND SUCH A MASTERPIECE CINEMATIC MOVIE GOES TO........ ALPHABET LORE!!!
Good ending
Now thats the right ending
Z HAS A gEM
Finally "z" not Z
This is the end?
Z finaly she baby know
the very goodness ending 😌😌😌
This amazing happy ending
i love good endings
The good ending
This is better than a bad ending
Omg this is the best ending ever
here's an idea for alphabet lore 3: lowercase letters understand that L and O behaved like bullies, so they marginalize them and when they become capital letters they behave like F in alphabet  lore 1
This is the best ending for a a movie
This made Wonder what f look like when he's older now (ps this made me cry)
LETS GOOO
nau și luc baby z
So that was z looks like😳😳😳😳
OH MY GAWD
"Now guys, come and get your Alphabet Lore NFTs!"
0:10 why F still not dead if you pause?
I will review this masterpiece for a long time
Sequel: Planet 0 was not happy about the ending. He sends a alarm. So series 2 is coming out soon.
Guys sub to this guy because he did a good ending!
omg omg omg estoy super feliz por este final me a encantado =D
This is an absolute Masterpiece you've created
I LOVE IT SO MUCH IT IS SO CUTE
I feel there will be more f x n art
Lol 🥀
Amazing video 11/10 But I don't like the new movement
What a plot twist. Incredible! It seems ellipsis power is to go backwards in time, giving n a chance to change things, even tho l and o were upset with that, he did the right thing to evade the death of someone  who didnt deserve it. And still making ; ? and ! . This has been amazing and thanks for making a happy ending, instead of killing poor F.  Also, i like the animation of Q putting ? into N for second time lmao.
The Happy Ending :)
Next time won't you sing with me
To de conditer
Happy ending
Best ending ever (well it is an epilogue and not an ending but yeah cool ending)
Likes are bigger than watches
Wow Thats Nice :)
Та самая хорошая концовка которую все заслужили
Q,s face tho
The best Mike salcedo video
Now We Need An Ending Where Baby Q Makes Its To The Rest In Time. But Still Keep The Marvelous Work Mike.
M.
The final piece of the puzzle
z is the best character
On thausind
part 2 please
Wait it isn't finished yet.                We need an alphabet lore which f and n where bullied and l and o were the villains
the way that Q give N the ? right in the mouth edit: when the future N and F started *xplode* to have number lore 2nd edit: the ried and s just left the chat
We love it F
It's really good that this ending is so perfect, even I've watched it 5 times        And now I hate L and O even more.
And so, N has saved the world from disaster...and Z can finally be in peace.
there is a lowercase z cool
This is good ending and real
Happy ending
And All Ended with Happy Ending :),Moral(I think):Get Bullied is not the most Hurt,but the Most Hurt is Have no Friends and Friends getting Hurt"
happy f and n
Pls part 2
alternate universe: Everything seems cursed and They are upside down
This is beautiful
This was an awesome birthday present to get on my birthday :)

Q: Mission complete now return to base
If y'all ship F x N, that's fine with me! It's okay if you hate the ship.
Now I need to know what happens after F turns good
wowww
this is the best thing I ever watched.
That was so adorable! I’m glad F finally got his happy ending.
I hope there is a season 2! It would be so cool! Like we see what would have happened if Z didn't do that mabye?

FINALLY MINI Z:D
BABY Z
Wow
YES!!! A GOOD ENDING.Also why kid Z has vocie of Adult Z?
Wow, look like an alternate ending but real ending🤩  Story myself: 0:01, So, F already died when anybody else is sad 0:10, Then Z used his power the "… gem" to time back in past 0:22, Q is using his power the "question gem" put into N 0:32, After the letters were capital, little f fell from n, he felt hallucinating and now he became brave and save his friend back 1:10, So now n is protecting him, f is very proud of him. l and o are beating them so both of them like hit each other together, the two tears of gems goes together the question and the semi-colon 1:37, They help each other goes up and back to f’s cave and n hugged p, cause he knows she help him up without helping the bullies, then he tears with explanation gem  1:54, f and n has back to his cave, z is very very happy of everything They’re all live happily ever after, The End :)
The way how Q force N to eat the power/ question mark 🤣
What happened to the planet when N went back to the flashback lowercase
Next time wont you sing with me?
YES WE FINNALY SEE LOWER CASE z
happily & ever after
You can make number lore with 1 2 3 and 4 Https://youtu.be/cloudyc
Atleast now we know with F and N united, the rest of the Alphabet will either be against the friendship of theirs, or forgive them and befriend them in the future  We don't need no more explanations, this Saga proved to be one of cinematic masterpieces on the Internet
z will now have sweet dreams
OMG THE GOOD ENDING SO WAIT ALPHABET LORE 2?!
Pravo buetyful and emotional

N did the right choice
Me realise there was ‘next time won’t you sing with me’ left in the abc song:

Now that was an ending

Actually N,more regret killing F and Z liked f and so Z Let him be in the baby times with his … Gem then Q had the ? Gem and Q did the Force to make N swallow it then they went in the baby times then f got hurt and then n he was going to stay with lmo but he remembered that he killed F and was sad then he went passed l and o then he went with f then f thought he would be with lmo but he didn’t then l and o hit them but they didn’t care then they had one tear that’s ? And : then switched then they went away then f hit g then n remembered the P helped him then he cried a tear that’s the ! Gem so P got that then you know what p did to n 😂 so he went back with f to go back to f’s mountain then they finally do z (this took so long please like)
next time wont you sing with me...?

Where do you make these animations?
P wha-
I was wishing for this to happen
Yay happy ending
Z was the hero of all time in this series

This is the best part of Alphabet lore. I'm interested in what will happen later
Hi
Perfect ending indeed
SO THİS MEANS ALL OF THE LETTERS LİVES ON TOP OF Z
I love that f and n dont even care when they got drop kick by o and l
Im just Happy At The End theres a good ending i just wanted to see this
Now i don’t know my ABCs... :(
❤️
Yes.YES. This was what I needed today
At least there now care for f since they know the truth
Now we have baby z
What happened to the uppercase now
NEW z! 1:59
what was z doing
Wow More Lore
Finally i get to see what lowercase z looks like
Hiii
The ending heppy
I-I'm not crying, I-I just have something in m-my eyes
i guess lowercase z is now cannon
WE NEED NUMBER LORE
Imagine Mike makes number lore and they meet alphabet lore 🤣 lol, chapter 2 confirmed :0 🤣
when f smiled when n tried to help was the best thing Ive ever seen
It's legendary
This series has a lot more potential than any other series. f and n being friends and living it the cave together has to be the cutest thing I’ve seen. And we finally got to see z, when they were a dwarf planet.
I wonder, Is he gonna do diffrent endings?
класс продолжение можно
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES Edited: Now I know my ABC, Next sould be next time want you sing with me right?
OMG i wasnt x pecting this ha.. Ha.. Get it?
Plz make a number lore
Best Endingen ever
NEW LOWERCASE Z! (z!)
Yes this was a great ending especially since F didn't have to be alone this time
Wow
Wow! Happy ending!!!
Yay
I just hope L and O will learn their lessons about bullying others
Happy :)
Your video alphabet lore is cinematic...
Yseeeeeeee
that's New lm like that video
I swear to god this dude made literally the best story out of the alphabet just by creativity. Props to Mike Salcedo for being one of the best animators with his hard work and dedication, he made the most entertaining stories out of anything. This whole alphabet universe was literally more entertaining than the avengers. If this story had a season 2, I'd watch it straight away. This really gives "Press F for respect" a whole new meaning!
1:50 P x N Edit: I guess some people did not get the joke lol
Ahhh yes there's lowercase z
Great   end   Good  final🤩😊😋🙂🤗☺😄😃😀😁😉😏👌👌👍👍👍
Awesome ending. Also the ending everyone wanted and deserved
Can we have FNvenge? That's where F and N teams up with all the letters to take revenge on L and O once and for all
Oh mah god
I cannot wait for alphabet lore season 2
Ayo
so this is a good ending right
Alphabet lore f and n friends all endings one gut aloy
Happy ending
Your video's exploited by the YouTube Kids cringe guys. Any word on this?
so thats what baby z look like
OMG COOL!
Thanks for happy ending 😊
THE ENDING WE ALL NEEDED OMG IS SO EPIC YEEEEES
Just what we needed
The ending is so wholesome😊
that was literally the perfect way to end the series
This is a good ending
Ok that was amazing
awwwww
the good ending of alphabet lore :)
What
Alternative title: Alphabet lore: the good ending
fn... (Mike Salcedo) REMAKE
this is perfect.
Soo look man :)
This is all we need not just the bad ending I hate that because n don't care in that ending so now... n has a revenge
Finally we have a chance to see lowercase Z
holy cow
😔 🪢 👕 👖
So Z's Gem Turns back time?
THE BEST ENDING
I would love to see a sequel where they are in adulthood but this sequel will show a lot more from the letters that didn’t do much e.g V, R, etc
no way there a part 2!
😭😭😭😭😭😭i love n and f
The good ending
so wholesome...
I just love how this ending is so wholesome that f and n got together :)
Love this
YAAAAAAAAAYYYYY THERE IS A EPILOG so then now we know Z’s gems is for reversing time? Ig (since there is a “now I know my abc’s” WHERE IS NEXT TIME WONT YOU SING WITH ME? + THIS SHOULD BE IN MOVIES) + 0:24 THAT IS LITERALLY ME + I’m so sorry I made this comment long
:0
Happy ending 😁 i love Alphabet letters
THAT'S WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!
3 🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭
The series was empty without this ending
😁😁😁😁
Z is the best Letter in this series
I like this ending TuT
The good ending friend
Finally à good ending
ABCDEFGHIKMLNOPQRSUVWXYZ
G standing in front of n may also symbolize the fact that G was the first one who decided to go up against F. First one to force an alliance, and also standing very bravely against F. Like that time he rude-stared him when he was stuck in green thing with N. G is basically the opposite of N, and thats why, N is hiding in his back, like a shadow! Cuz he is a coward. Well. Was.
Wait what?
Now waiting for "Next time won't you sing with me"
inf/10,make more or you will never see the day of the light again.
I think alphabet lore it have a bad ending but mike salcedo make this video and i like this video

Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww
Oh my god they were roommates
Wow IC a kul
Hapy ending every one Alive
Z as a baby is so F-ing CUTEEEE

:.....)
So z and q decided to help and turn back time to when the incident happend
There's A New Part

Yes! The good ending! We also have lowercase Z!
Baby Z's voice sounds like the original Z
this is a masterpiece
Happy the and
So this is the past in alphabet lore part 2
Well that was really really unexpected
That was a really wholesome ending. Amazing work on the series. :D
z can sleep now
0:24: Q:what the F*ck you doing N N:I din't do anything
Wait i thought this was another fan animation *_BUT OH SHIT THIS IS CANNON AND MADE BY MIKE_*       1:58 *_ALSO HOLY SHIT NOT FANMADE CANNON BABY Z DESIGN REAVEALED_*
What's gonna happened in the future after Z save the day:  F & N are going to be best friends forever, will they go out just for playing with the others?  L & O are going to be the bad guy M & P is the only superhero X is still a Ninja G is fall in love with P Q will be happy  H is not gonna be eaten by F, he save Y is still saying: Why?  F & N will make a friends with U, they combine, it's spelled: FUN Every Alphabets will enjot they're life R I E D S meet F & N together, and combine into: FRIENDS THE END
I was trying to find something else until I found this, a true masterpiece.
Now we know what lowercase z looks like
이게 진짜지...
I Never See This Before
:0
Now z is lowercase
That was the best!
Is sad😭
yea but that f died it is so sad
Finally an ending without f being left out
YESSSSSSSSSSS! FINALLY I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ALL YEAR LONG! THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!
Yes YES
Give this to netflix pls
Z is so cute. All of them are cute
Now the real evil it’s L and O
I’ve been keeping up with this series since February and I never could’ve expected for it to be where it is today. It honestly feels so surreal for it to finally get a true conclusion (And even more so how early I am to see it). But in the end I think it was meant to be. I’m so happy to see so much respect and support shared over such a talented animator. Thank you, Mike, for keeping up with this hilarious, emotional, accidental masterpiece until the very end. I can’t wait to see whatever comes next.
AYO I SEE F IN THE TOP OF THE MOUNTIAN AVILE 0:10
Happy ending f never killed anyone

baby z is the most adorable I ever seen today!😊
Good eding🥰
we need this future of N and F are being friends please continue
😭😭 you deserve more subs than T-series
wait so you know that all the powers are like ?! but the thing is theres one missing and its hash tag  the one that looks like tic tac toe
The good ending
FINALLY THE GOOD ENDING
P
Finally Z makes sense in this story Best ending ever
HOLY SHIT I WOULDN'T HAVE EVER EXPECTED THIS, the elipses really did meant to be continued
Wait, is n gonna explain what happened? Well crap.
Yay thank you so much the last
we know the truth now
Epic ending
The nicest good ending
I knew this would be the title  But damn, what an amazing ending, the story fixed nearly everything without causing any paradoxes with the time travel. And baby z is adorable  EDIT: i have a theory there will be another part  after the alphabet the song goes ''Now you know your ABCs'' (this) and then ''Next time wont you sing with me'' Additionally, in the description, it has ''this chapter'' this implies their is another, and with the popularity alphabet lore has, its probable that this won't be the end
Me just screenshoting and posting it on picsart lol
amazing
This is so amazing I'm crying
I noticed the actual creater made thin not a fan
the end
Thank You Z
My love 🥹
Make more this
I guess z was the giant ground and not planet
if Q and Z is good cuz q untill small he swallod a ?
Niiiiicw!Epiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiic!
this is the best series of all time
N Loves F
FINALLY LOWERCASE Z
Perfect. We all needed this
Awwww so adorable! It really cheered me up :-)
좋은 에필로그 감사합니다...ㅜㅜ Thanks for this good epilogue...TT
Make number lore
2:03 LOWERCASE Z?! i just can't stop watching this
Yuo god
this is how it really shouldve happened didnt make sence that N and F were friends but he left him and went with O? the person who shot him? good job mike for making this part realistic sorry for the rant.
OMG Happy end
Yasss
iam makeing in on flipaclip
Mike Salcedo is the best guy in the world he just made alphabet lore more of a good ending
731th comment taken
FINALLY A HAPPY ENDING
Now I know my ABC’s 😔
Sad
after F's death now N x _
790th nice!
:0
Yay lowercase Z is here!
Yes
Ok. I like your Alphabet lore series. Btw, i guess i was right that the ellipsis around Z actually granted the possibility to control time.
Q!!!
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
There are a lot of things that changed after this video was made, he made this because it got popular and because I think people started arguing because they thought baby z didn’t exist and he was made by the same way other planets are made.
I wonder how that future would look like?
NEW ALPHABET LORE?
Last one ended with a ... which means that there's more to come  And then we got this
Absolutely Amazing
I wonder if mike is aware of the cringe alphabet lore vids
And thats so it ends...
Ok
Is real lore
;)
f x n
U made baby Z :)
해피앤딩
A true ending for a true masterpiece. Well done. I couldn't be more amazed by a mere animation.
Netflix i know just the thing to save your platform
Wow...
Eeeeeee official end
The greatest ending i've seen in my life. Better than marvel
This so sad
:D
He returned when we most needed him
good ending
Gonna tell my sister’s kids this was Alphablocks
I watched the alphabet lore so many times that this is accurate
During the part when Z reverses time at 0:16, That is a reference to when N shot his beam and killed F, and all the others looking at it.
YESS YESS YESSS!! THE ENDING WE ALL DESERVED IS FINALLY HERE!! you did it again with the emotional rollacoaster,my heart is pounding with joy. ans thus,this is the proof that you can make a very well-made masterpiece storyline that makes people emotional with the simplist things like the letters of the alphabet.  also,spoiler warning: YOOO Z saves the day!! also i am very interested that the ... gems can rewind time/changing time. also lowercase z is very cute,i am suprised that lowercase z is exact same design that i imagined.(non-firey/burning planet like,just a smaller version of the uppercase design+with less teeth)
and f and n lived happily ever after..
Do Alphabet Lore The Movie
The thumbnail: *Q being a literal god*
OMG THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH MA GAH
You should make an alphabet lore 2 when they try to find a potion to cure everyone but the number lore gets in there way that means war but they save everybody's lives
POV: You wanted to see this happen ever since you saw the original vid
Bro here in México at 2:30a.m. see it this Masterpiece 😎

;+! =&
42 min ago
VERY GOOD ENDING☹BUT IM SAD BECOUS ITS THE END😔
Correct me if I'm wrong. So Z rewinded everything, hoping for a better result for the future but it ended as a loop. Q  got in time and showed the future and gave the question mark to N so he will know what will happen, after they're young, n faced his fears and went for f to help him. And then the future changed and f was never alone now z is happy.
Please Ep 2
A good ending : D
Good ending:
that one ending in the movie where the main character alters the past
Wat
The end. of course.
why did Z do the elipisses thingy and when the question mark and this thingy “;” it made an & ampersand
Z haters before epilogue: "He dIDNt dO aNYTHinG" Z haters after epilogue:
I was hoping this would happen😄
Wow
this ending was wonderful.
HOW DID Z DO THAT!?
WOW I MADE IT JUST IN TIME
2:02 baby z
It is a happy ending
yay good ending :)
The good ending we always wanted
this is a masterpiece!
Is F still dead?
Q:e a t T h e G e m N:why-
alphabet lore but the true TRUE endings real
This is why Q Z and F are underrated
This is a great ending, really! And I hope this is the end.. tell me is this the end for sure? Everything is great here!
so proud to be part of the first 1000 comments
Good ending
This is what I was waiting for..

Awwwwww🥰😘☺️
It's like alphabet lore but a happy ending
I would love to see how the story would play out if N didn't betray F, It would mainly just be L and O (and most of the others) trying destroy the both of them.
E
I LOVE THIS
Part but good ending?
Nice
i like how z formed rings
Ok but seeing Z happy...😳🤙🏽
omg I love this Edit:dose this effect the lore?
I wish you would make more alphabet series i like them my favorite letter is F and f
알파벳으로 이정도로 아름다운 스토리를 만드셨다니 대단합니다.
Hey Mike salcedo can you comment to PFA the AZURE cube shaped  alien after you uploaded the new video
this is an amazing end to the story
Always love a nice happy ending.
alternative title:alphabet lore but N is actually nice to F in the past
That was a cute baby z
finally a good ending
FINALLY we have baby/lowercase Z
Yes
YESSS HAPPY ENDING
Who like F friend
COOL! The letter F and the letter N are now friends!
Finally, Z use The Power
And that little kiss p gave N is cute
alphabet lore but good ending
Z is a baby
so that mark makes you go back in time… amazing ending!!
EVERYONE THOUGHT BABY Z WAS RED
This is kinda good ending :)
n trade for for he's gem
WHY IS BABY Z SOOO CUTE!!!
Z finally gets a lowercase version of him
The good ending ☺️
z is cute as a baby-
Bring on the ketchup
THE BEST SERIES EVER
Poor F I feel really bad but this made me really happy with the fact that N standned up for is friend
YOOO
2:01 after been years since, we finally know what Z looks like as a baby.
Pov: you finished one of your fav series and you don't know what to do next
the best ending by far. Z is now in peace with the other letters.
I can’t believe there is an epilogue, or should I say, true ending to the story didn’t think that there would be. Where f and n live happily ever after. I wished it shown them growing up though would’ve been cool but that doesn’t matter. I felt bad for F’s backstory I love the one tooth coming out of z
I cried all the time
We finally got the good ending folks
What a great ending, j is still chill
I beg you to make either number Lore or more alphabet lore please!
New videos
....................Damn.......
So the gems (at least the ;?!) Can be created from happiness!
and make a suite on this video😌😌
ah, a happy ending, noice
Early
Wow what a happy ending
That was Z a baby
Now happy ending 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
True Ending of Alphabet Lore N and F will be true *F* rie *N* ds
i love this  i also love zis face 1:17
Sry i find this anticlimactic it was that simple of Z to reset time for N to just fix the problem
!
Best Ending
WAIT IS THIS A SNEAK PEEK OF ALPPABET LORE 2?
Good ending
Z: let's go back to when I was younger
Finally some respect for F and all thanks to Z and Q
And nothing shall turn into chaos
Yeessss
This is the best ending!
ayyyyy (naw made me cry that’s crazi but anyways ITS SO AMAZING I LOVE THIS :) )
Yong Z looks sooo cute
Thank you.
Is that the baby Z
Never knew u will make this
Ok
Plzzz next video
Cool
i wish you had 500K subs for this.
You are best youtuber ever
holy
The Most Awaited Ending
Great. Now make Thorn The Sun.
the legend is back! i've never seen someone make a masterpiece like this!
No one expected lowercase Z
Clicked faster than I clicked
Happy ending! Baby Z is so cute!
Yall guys are wrong designing z not random lava bucket volcano fire master fire bender dude like earth Z is his own planet but its still ok
Awww, a thankful ending! Baby Z is so cute! The question mark gem is literally for F due to the color. In the prologue, notice that Q has no very strong powers with the gem unlike the LMNOP group.
this make me cry😭😭😭
After that, what will happen in the future? Does our letter lives friendly and peafully together?
Thanks I have cried and this is a Materpiece
within 30 miniutes..   what an ending. truly incredible
This is really good
Achievement: The True Ending
Now we all know how z looks like when he was a child!
Why is this so adorable...
Omg its finally out!
Make the happy version on old version cause I think F and N (not tiny) will be happy and all
R.I.P
2:03 lowercase Z
Good ending
you what! A happy ending
this is happy 😭😭😭😭
What an awesome way to end my birthday! I’m so glad that N was being assertive just to make F happy, and it makes me happy!  I give my applause! Awesome work!
Me: ello z baby z: AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
-Alphabet- -Lore- -Season- -II?-
Yes we needed this
Hold up, can N create a power too?    Btw is this final end?                   ….             Why r u still reading this?               nvm
i like it its very Nice lol
Now this is a TRUE ending 🤩🤩🤩
Yoooooooo
Little Z at the end?
I literally am friends with them in my heart now…
This is the pt 2 that i needed
Z saves f for a reason
J literally got vanquished in the first 5 minutes
Omg! After million years we got it. The epik/great endong
Bad ending: Q forgot to give N the ? stone, n doesn’t know the future. N becomes a coward and not save f. And Z will die of sadness.
now this is better the time has changed its plot from the past and everything was now peace and F i mean f was now back and everyone now are one word "ABCs"
IS THAT BEBE Z😳😳😱😱😱😱😨😨😨
Thanks you F❤😊
1:58 Lowercase Z
Q：？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？
Early
and there's a baby Z
Ok, hold on, need to figure this out... Z's gems have the power to reverse time. Upon finding out F was never evil, Z reversed time and Q used his gem to insert N's consciousness into n. n remembered that F wasn't evil, and stood by him. The only gems created were the ; ! And ?, And N and F lived together in F's cave, F staying good due to N's kindness. *HAPPY ENDING!!!!*
wow 25 min ago
This is so wholsome
The fact that N and F don't even care that they are beated by L and O makes it even better
A happy ending😘😘😍😍🥰🥰💞💞❤❤
this is basically a part 2 of alphabet lore i love it and keep the work up!
I hope it's real
Z doesn't sound younger at all.
nice!
Alphabet lore: good ending
What z!?
Very good
So let me understand the lore, Z used it's tear to travel to the past, baby n replaced Q's role but sine he is not a slug he managed to change the future, he got beaten up, along with f, and even tho they got beaten up, they are still happy.
AFTER Z YES OR z
yeeeeeee
I remember having weird dreams where there would be a weird creature, when the creature would die it’s pupils will disappear, that’s the first thing that came to my mind when I saw dead F laying there
Finally we saw a small Z!
It's so awesome good ending
THAT WAS…. AWESOME!!!!!!!
Is this real
Hi
Omg!!!!
We need season 2... with the cyrillics... or the greeks... or the digits... UPDATE!: Mike just changed the description of the ...Epilogue video, AND WE GONNA HAVE SEASON 2

I love that ending less heart breaking than before
Thank you for this wonderful ending   Its friends

Good luck to the letters in the new reality
The good ending.
I’d love to see a sequel where this continues into adulthood.
2:04 OMG THIS IS A REAL LOWERCASE Z
This was unexpected but it was an happy ending once and for all.
Finally! We were waiting for this.
No, it is not for kids!
I Just Realised...     This Wasn't Fanmade...
WE MAKED F FRIENDLY
0:22 Q:Change the world... my final message...goodbye
We all thought it was it, but it wasn't always it without a good ending, thus, the end for real...
Lowercase Q is wrong tho its q not Q
We have waited centuries for this amazing masterpiece              and ngl it actually made me cry
The series that just keeps getting better
This was very sweet. I was feeling pretty bad tonight, but these little characters getting a happy ending made me feel better. Thank you.
Holy macaroni
This video is a 10/10
Nice
back in the past
The Great Ending! 10000/10👏 Apparently the ... was indeed useful  Edit: Did anyone notice F at the top of his cave at 0:10? (Play in 0.25 speed)
*The ending we all wanted and needed*

Dang, who knew the ellipsis would reverse time.
So cute
The good ending.
Did not expect an epilogue, but just glad this series ended on good terms!
Now do Won’t you next time sing with me where upper case F finally becomes finally friendly and F R I E D S And N bes friends together and now everything is now normal
Before 1k
I LOVE IT!!!
The Happy Ending      The Best Ending EVER!!!!
Wow 😃 👍
finaly part 2
MASTERPIACE
Making Spainsh Alphabet Lore
That was unexpected
I love the ending!
YouTube kids is gonna have a field day with this one
Oh my god, yes. I'm really glad that F finally has n as a friend EVEN if they casted them both out :)
YAYYYYYYYY  Z I love you thank you
18 min ago wow
so that was z’s power!!! GREAT! edit: forgotten gems would be: “” () [] ' /
Best thing ever
"Z" is God but more like... Zod
What we have learn:     Z's gem is similar to Q , but instead of seeing the future , he can travel through time.  So Z used his gem to get back where F was being bullied , As N knows about what happened , instead of leaving F alone , he decides to still be close to him , which made L and O pissed , and then , N cries , making Q's and P's gems appear. But the question mark goes back to N , Z saved the whole alphabet , costing a little bit of his age.  Such an good ending!
This was truly one of the most wholesome and saddest stories I've seen
next time won't you sing with me?
10/10 better than avengers endgame            numberbet lore
is this a sequel?
The end What an amazing animation and ending
Z looks so weird with his mouth like that
POOR F
Sime
so good ending
true
A good ending
This is what WE needed
Cool Animation
THIS IS WHAT CATHARSIS FEELS LIKE
MIKE SALCEDO YOUR A GENIUS , YOU CAN MAKE A WONDERFULL STORY WITH A THING AS SIMPLE AS THE ALPHABET, I LOVED THIS SERIES AND I LOVE YOUR CONTENT
FINALLY BABY ZZZZZZZZ
OH MY GOD BABY Z
Claim your early ticket
I W he no
And they lived happily ever after and mega gay
I feel like I watched a 15-hour movie for some reason?  but.. Bro, That ending made me happy as hell.. z's tooth was so adorable! And, n really helped f this time :)
It's the end
epic
5 good reason why you should rewatch= 1. Baby Z 2. F and N still friends 3.N defending F 4.Z and Q saving the world 5.give this man money
Oh. So THATS what Z can do.
the ending everyone wanted but no one expected
Know I can rest having dreams that f get his good ending  this is perfection
I thought Alphabet Lore ended with Z, but… this is the real ending.
I love this.
This was beautiful. It’s a perfect ending.
Ayo lol
I was never expecting this Baby Z is definitely the most adorable thing I have seen in forever
I'm gonna leave a comment right here I hope someone won't see it
Lowercase z first appeared
Z and Q took N back when they we're small to save F. the true villains are O and L.
Good
WITH THE POWER OF *TIME TRAVEL!*
Crushed (Symbol)
…Wait, Then Resurrecting C, F, H, J, P, And X Route?
wat about number lore 1 - 26 since there's 26 alphabet in the alphabet idk what lm saying rn.
Good ending!!!
🙂
G Want To Here???
Well I wasn’t expecting an epilogue! I knew that ellipse was gonna lead to something
This is cooler than i thought
WHAT A GOOD ENDING
WTH WHY IS THE LITTLE Z SOUNDS SO DEEP!??
After a hundred of years I finally found it the ending we were looking for.
Man what a journey this has been
we needed this so much
YES mike!!
Spat
O Is Now Know Now He Tick Them All
Well now people need to see this!
Now we need part 3 because where are the cursive letter?!?!
This is to dramatic 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
WOW
z
I have no idea how someone could make even the alphabet have some sort of story.  This almost feels like a 2-D Pixar movie, as there are hidden details everywhere, yet you won't notice them because the amazing story distracts you from them.  And that's a good thing...
good ending?
G's Reverge,Right??
This is sad ending😢
letter f and n and z is ciut n is good f's help! l m o is bad!
I KNEW IT WASN'T OVER            ...Next time, won't you sing with me?
bro the numbers tribe aint got shit on this lore
Finally
This ending.. I love it.. 🥺
oh now i know whats z look like when he is younger
Why did you make them act gay

That was a amazing finale... We need more of this, Like Season 2...
I love this😍😍😍 I wanted this😍😍😍
How is this video about literal English letters better than most movies today...
Can't believe I'm emotionally attached to the letters of the alphabet. This is such a great series, and I'm glad they're getting their happy ending !
Thank you mike salcedo for send this video for me❤
The ship is now 10× stronger
Petition to nominate this as the best series in 2022. 👇

"It's never too late to change everything"
