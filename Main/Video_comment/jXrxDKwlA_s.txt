When you’re in the wrong, you must keep apologizing over and over to Chris, never stopping until you’re forgiven. That’s your attitude in The Pursuit of Happyness, right?
"Dwight, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius"
Damn…. When did Will Smith become such a loser?
I will always now be against will smith
travis scott a$$ apology
ウィルスミスさんは決して間違った行動はしていない自分にとって大切な人を馬鹿にされてどれほど悲しかったかもう一度みんな考えて欲しい。 たとえジョークでも「ジョークだから」ですまされるようなことではないと思うみんなはどう思うか教えて欲しい
Is there any man here who has not made a bad split second deicision or lost his cool when he shouldnt of?
I get it, as he said, we are human and we make mistake, no one is perfect. When you are famous and you have the image you have, in an event that big, you should have evaluated your actions before you do them. I don't think I will be able to forget this sad moment. But everyone deserve a chance and mistakes happens.
I forgive Will Smith now. The incident just seemed out of the ordinary for Will, that’s all.
Thin-skinned LIGHTWEIGHT.
日本では、人のデリケートな問題をジョークにし笑い飛ばすという事は人の尊厳を貶めるマナーのない非常に恥ずべき行為です。 私は貴方が間違っているとは到底思えないし、間違っているのは寧ろ逆だと思っている。 手を出してしまった行為自体は間違いだったかもしれない。 でも貴方のその気持ちは何も間違ってない。 貴方が謝るなら、お相手も奥様に謝罪すべきだと思う。 誰かの悲しみで得るジョークなんて全く楽しくない。 つまらないし、不愉快で怒りしか感じない。 そんなコメディアン、私は二度と顔も見たくない。 文化的な違いではあるけれど、日本人は貴方を大切な人を守ったヒーローだと思ってます。 大切な人を馬鹿にされたら腹が立つのは当たり前だと思う。許せない。 どうかそのままの貴方でいてほしいです。 これからもずっと貴方が大好きです。
YAAAAAA. IT'S REWIND TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ここのコメント見てると思うけど、英語圏の人間やっぱ狂ってるね。 ここにいるアメリカ人の何割が家族をバカにされた後手を出さずにいられるのか気になって仕方がないよ。 いまだに彼が謝る必要があったなんて思えない。
Hey Will, I am nobody to you but yet I am everybody to you. We all are connected my spiritual brother.   I was so disappointed in your behavior. I know you know that you can do better.   I am a spiritual being like all of us walking this gift of life as a spirit living in a body.   We are here to love, grow, expand & make mistakes. That's how we learn.   I forgive you. Will.   I forgive you because you are growing. YOU are expanding.   Keep moving forward with joy and love in your heart.   Impath,  Intuitive, healer & medium,  Joe  P.S. dont hesitate to reach out for guidance. I am here for you. ✌️ I am here for everyone to be of service and to help.
I want to give this video a thumbs down, but it won't let me.  I think they deactivated the dislike button.
That was a genuine apology.
日本は、愛する人が嫌な思いをしている時に 空気を読んで行動を起こせない人も場合も少なくないので、 あんなに大きな舞台で行動を起こしたwillは、やっぱり今振り返ってもかっこいい父ちゃんで、 頼りになる旦那なんだよなー！！  暴力は絶対ダメなんだけどね！！ もしクリスが自分のお父さんだったら、 恥ずかしいと思ったと思うなー。
Awesome performance! For the sponsor and for any invitation to any other award show or movie roles. Nice. 9/10. Lack tears, if not i would give 10/10. Please be yourself like in that award show. The real you, what a hero.
Привет Уил, лично я полностью на твоей стороне,   ты защитил честь твоей семьи, ты поступил как настоящий мужчина, и не надо ни перед кем извиняться, ты это сделал, значит так было нужно, ни каких сожалений! Удачи!
Who loves ya baby?
Such a great actor but such a destructive lifestyle; sure makes for a tumultuous life and way of living.
"Nuances and complexities" yeah ok buddy
I ALWAYS LIKE WIL, BUT NO MORE. EVEN WITH THIS APOLOGY THIS HAS REALLY TARNISHED YOUR HOLLYWOOD CAREER AND IT SHOULD.  ALL THE SUGAR COATED WORDS WILL NEVER ERASE THAT VISION IN PEOPLE MINDS.  YOUR BEHAVIOR AND MOUTH WERE A OUTRAGE!!!
Sorry, Inexcusable!  You have little or no self control, it’s not complicated .  I was the biggest of fans, but you now go into my never, ever pile.
맨인블랙 영화로 보게된 흑인배우, 당신의 팬으로써 그 상황들은 틀린행동은 아니었다고 생각했습니다. 하지만 다른이들이 과하다고 생각함에 있어서 사과하고 용서를 구함에 있어서 멋지다고 생각합니다
I had a lot more that I wanted to say here, but it really is unnecessary.  I'll keep is short and sweet.  You are a good man, Will.

We are all human. Will, I Still think you're Badass!!!! It's all good, I got your back.
He’s such a great actor, he has given so many years to the entertainment industry and it’s upsetting to see people make him a villain now and not acknowledge him the same way because of one mistake, everyone is human, we all make mistakes. we should keep everything in mind, just a thought, some people may disagree.
Why are  you not saying why you did it?

Will is just a man... We all make mistakes. For real tho.. I grew up lookin up to you. I still respect you as a brother. And for that reason i really hope you leave hollywood. Leave the fame go enjoy your life brother.
Remorseful includes shame!
Seems sincere, I hope he continues to work on himself.
This man is so fake!
You so fannt get my phone my real husband the show is so real man get in trouble call the police officer tomorrow on you don't know me like that
You so fannt
スミスさんの行動は褒められたものではありませんでした。 ですが、家族への想い、人の痛みに気づくことのできることは誇るべきです。 日本には「言葉の暴力」とゆうものがあります。 暴力を振るわなくても言葉で相手を傷付けてしまう事を言います。 傷つける言葉かどうかは人それぞれで違うので、この言葉は使ってはいけないなんてことは言えません。 大事なのは相手が傷ついた事に気付けるかどうか、そして、そのことを認めて心から謝罪出来るかが大事だと思います。 この件でスミスさんは家族想いで、優しい人なんだと思いました。  貴方の想いは何も間違っていない！全世界の人が否定し批判しようと、スミスさんの家族を想う心は素晴らしいと思います。  どうかその想いを忘れずに貴方のままでいてください。 そして、人を思いやる心を世界に広げてください。 そうすれば国や文化、人種なんて関係なく友達になれる世界になると思います。  あなたにはそれができると信じています。  日本の片隅でいつまでも応援しています。
暴力はいけないけど言葉の暴力はいいの？  ウィルスミスも謝ったんだからクリスも奥さんに謝るべきだと思う。  奥さんを守ったウィルスミスの方が凄くかっこいいし、前よりもっと好きになった。  活動応援してます。また日本に遊びに来て下さい。
CLM ✊

Bro I feel you now Nobody cares They wants to see the world burn Stay strong  I love you will
You guys did Will dirty smh
疲れたらまた日本に遊びに来て下さい！
The comments section is ruthless😢
So much respect for this!
This is just pathetic and insincere.
I love the hat Will. Keep it up. You've got what it takes to be a somewhat decent human. Good job again.
Will, we should talk about the political and economic state of the world right now. Please reach out once you receive this. Godspeed sir.
Im bet chris dont needed your apologize. He just want you to drop out from entertaintment act screen
As this is obviously an insincere apology, I wonder if it is meant to be another insult to Cris. I will be fine with not seeing Will in films again.
This is a man whos tryna stop bleeding of his wealth desperately, doubt he cares bout his actions.
What, no dog?
I love u always bro! and I hope you to keep good relationship with chris!
phony will smith with his phony apology ... that's why chris doesn't accept it, he can see right through this brother
You made a mistake and owned it, that's all you can do. Time will heal this.
今でもウィルは悪くないと思ってる 言葉も人を傷つける 大切な人を傷つけられたら守るのは当たり前 ウィルは家族を守っただけ！  I love Will！from japan
No matter a moment, this one is still deserving of love.
Star Platnum
What more could the brother have done? Respect to you Will.
大衆の前で妻の病気の事で笑い事にされて、ビンタで済ませてるだけウィル・スミスさんは偉いと思う。暴力といっても平手打ちだと、対したケガにはならないこれが殴っていたら悪いと思うが、譲歩してると思う。 彼は悪人か？ 悪人だとして、なぜ自分以外の人の事でこんなにも彼は怒ったんだ？ 妻の気持ちがあの場で一番分かったからじゃないのか？ 日本人としては、批判されすぎだと思うしかっこよかったです！ あなたは侍でした！
what a time to be alive this was
1:00 1:02
Here's my thing he plays Alpha roll movies completely destroyed his his only son is like gay and then now his daughter is God knows what that's about and it's just like what the hell is happening to that family to where you know the alpha Will Smith is no longer is not an alpha
Just "Im sorry" would have been better, and then just keep saying it everywhere.  Why you should repeat it everywhere is only because you are a really good actor, people may have a hard time deciphering sincerity.
I thought you were the Fresh Prince for life man, it goes to show how life can really mess with your mind and emotions
Bro took like 3 damn months to apologize 💀
家族を愛し、守ろうとした行動に、 理解を示すと共に、 最大の敬意を表します。
Will Smith, if you were in The Spirit Of Truth, you could’ve got away with it if you was not moved by the imagination of your heart life.
You and I would have never been friends because I know your spirit, it would have been what’s up man and that’s all! And you know what I’m talking about.
To be fair, always liked your movies, the stuff that you doing with your community is nice. I don’t see any Problem which is that big like the media made it. Man stood up for his family, I think that most of man’s wouldn’t be so tough do pull up something like that. Proud of you 👍🏼.  Have a good one
クリスは病気である奥様の髪の毛をネタにして笑いを誘いました。 でも奥様は当然、良い気はしません。 当たり前です。 大切な奥様を傷つけたところを目の前にしたら、旦那さんとして怒るのは当然です。  ただ、『暴力を振るった』と言う事実だけなら暴力は決して許されるべきことではありません。 しかし、そうなるに至ったのには大きな理由があり、そうさせたのはクリスで、人の容姿や病気をネタに人を笑わせるなんて下劣な笑いだし、コメディアンとしては最低。 コメディアンは、人を笑わせて幸せにする職業。 人を傷つけて笑いをとって幸せにするものではない。  これは明らかにクリスに問題があると思います。
Those 121k likes would have to be bots bro tbh.

One day late and a dollar short.
I don’t really sure how he can smile and behave totally normal in other videos even he ruined someone’s life. Shame on u for ur whole life. You did not get his forgive yet. If you really feel sorry for him, you should try to appologise continuously. How long does it take. This video seems just you are acting for you and your family.
2:51
Chump
What was supposed to be such a profound moment in Wills career actually turned out to be the night that he possibly wrecked his career. There’s something to that, like a reminder that even when you have “it” it can be taken away, you could be the person that takes it away. So is “it” really worth it? Or is “it” just an idea that has been hyped up as being important?
someone gimme the link
You so fannt get in trouble  you don't know me
You don’t sound like someone from west Philadelphia. I still love you forever tho.

This is the funniest video I’ve seen in a while 😂😂🤡🤡
1:01
Why does this sound like a first grader apology
Will, i doubt youll see this, but I want to give you correct information regarding emotional processing.  When you say "Im trying not to be ashamed of myself, but rather deeply remoresful" - this is not the correct psychological route to take. Youve likely been advised that shame is bad, toxic, etc. That is wrong - it is REPRESSED or INTERNALIZED shame that is harmful.  Instead, in a situation like this, you need to allow that shame to be FELT. In a situation like this, shame is the natural emotion to come up. You need to hold space for that feeling. It is very painful. It also is HUMBLING. After you face the feelings of shame, sit with them, you will feel completely humbled, but there will be a RELIEF that floods you. You will no longer be resisting your own emotions. Youll no longer be fighting them. And you will be so much wiser as a result.  Remorse is also necessary, but it is repressed shame which our culture does not properly deal with, and many stuggle due tp that fact. With your influence, if you deal with this properly and allow yourself to be vulnerable, you could really make a huge impact in the world.
Hey Will! My heart goes out to you and your family with all that you guys are going thru. I've always been a fan and was hoping my first born could one day play your son bc he looks just like you lolol. But then you had 2 boys so I knew that kicked mine out the motion pics lol. But on a serious note, I will keep you guys lifted in prayer. It's crazy to me how people go against you guys for living your life. That's not true nor unconditional love. I love you and pray that God gives you all the joy your heart and hands can hold Will...I sincerely mean that. Best wishes to you and yours, keep working on you and you'll be fine. 💖💖
At your highest point thats where the devil comes for you...clearly something took over will i suspect he had a nervous breakdown that day and took it out on chris...i can truly say will smith is a better human being than what we saw
Maybe, just maybe, we should start with the premise that this man is human. He made a huge mistake, like everyone of us have made in our lives, his, unfortunately for him, was made in front of millions of people who somehow forgot that they have also made big mistakes.
I hope they black ball you from Hollywood
Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone
Will smith is the greatest youtuber
You're a good guy.  Wrong woman that's all.
Love you Will. "We Fall Down but We Get Up"

He ain’t sorry he did it, he’s sorry that it looked bad.
4:57 He’s human guys, he’s forgiven for making a shitty PR apology
Chris deserved it though
Honestly Will’s video is far more sincere than both of Ezra Miller’s statements
Good guy, forget these comments
The white bulb behind his head is deliberately placed there to look like a halo and make Will look angelic.  That is so pathetic

Everyone just meeds to realize hes a human being and we make mistakes. Its no ones fault but your own when you start to idolize people because no one is perfect. And for the people saying he didnt apologize or he needs to do more, hes not apologizing to you so just move on with your life. God bless 🙏
No way 100k people apreciate this. At no point did he ever formally apologize. He made a 5 minute video where he answers unrelated questions and diverts everyones expectations by making himself out to be "lost" and needs "development" hes like 100 years old at this point he shouldve grown up by now and learnt a well enough lesson to properly apologize
Im just glad he didnt pull out a ukulele and start singing
CLM ✊
He is a good person . A lil mental due to lifelong torture frm homeside. A complete joker but a good person
a public apology, really?
As a human you are gonna make misstakes some bigger then others. But its imoptent to learn from the misstakes.   So with that said i still love u as a actor and as a person. Keep working love from me❤❤❤
You don't owe us anything. We still love you, if not more 🤍
What the f, everyone snaps in their life, and they dont care what the setting is, and how many people are watching, he is an OG, Always!
I looked up to will smith as a big brother throughout his long list of characters and career. We have all done or been in a situation as such, just not as big of a stage. We are all guilty of looking at people in Hollywood as God's and I'd like to thank Will Smith for giving us all a reality check and showing us that just like the song "I'm only human afterall"...
Still a more genuine apology video than the likes of, say, Colleen Ballinger's apology video... Not that that's a huge accomplishment
Will, all I have to say is just be the man Uncle Phil would want you to be, that’s all any of us wants. Thank you for apologizing my brother, if it was as heartfelt as it seemed, I think you’re on the road to healing the wounds
Should’ve pulled out a ukulele.
Are you guys done now?
Will Smith is a good guy. He really didn’t mean to do it if he says so. He’s not like other celebrities who let Hollywood overtake him and his life
What about my mom? She spilled her purple drank when you smacked that dude.
When you forgive yourself you can let go of your mistakes.you are still a wonderful human being. Take care
All you need to do is forgive yourself that is how we let go
And that mayo
Dhik
He wanted to protect his wife's honor, he reacted without thinking first
We all make mistakes, it shows he is human .
Staged or not, sincere or not, this is still progress worthy of recognition. How much progress or to what end only he and his therapist could really know for sure.  Glad he tried.  Change happens when the discomfort outweighs the gratification. I hope this is a change for the best.
Faker than Kim K’s Implants

Will si fuiste impulsivo pero fuerza eres el mejor triste mente no todos tenemos valores, ni etica laboral  para respetar a los demas 😢❤ 😊 me alegra que enfrentes los problemas y te redimas aun que ellos no lo hagan es mejor sanar y perdónar y si son toxicos que se vallan o me voy, solo gente positiva no negativa 🐮🐽🙂 fuerza dios esta contigo
Para mi estuvo bien que lo golpeara pero en si el fue usado por los guionistas de los premios tristemente, tarde o trempano se meterian en problemas e  escuchado siempre los chistes de los premios son muy groseros y prentenciosos dejen de ser toxicos.❤
Its nice that will doesn't turn off the comment cause other will just do it immediately
I forgive him. Everyone deserves a second chance, no matter how bad they have done something
Im never gonna get mad at the fresh prince of bel-air
You are a great actor, no one doubts it! He will continue to create great movies for us, you publish. Thank you for letting us see part of your life. It is wise to rectify mistake.
Where is jadas apology video ???!
I know it's not easy living in the public eye. But you are only human. Enjoy your life. Really think about your relationships and the people around you. Continue to do the work to make you a better man.  You deserve peace and love. God bless❤.
You are still my favorite actor. Cheer up Will. And PLEASE tell Neflix Korea to put them BEL AIR show back. They really removed the greatest show of all time. What am I supposed to watch now???
윌 스미스 당신은 잘못하지 않았습니다 내부인을 욕하는데 가만히 있다면 그건 겁쟁이거나 부인을 사랑하지 않는거다
Their is no way you can ever  please man, don't be too harsh on yourself.
You don't have to prove anything, taking this time to look back and realising what you did wrong is more than enough 👍
I will always love you will
Most of don’t have our worst moments in front of an audience of literally millions of people. I sincerely hope he and Chris are able to find healing. I hope Will can learn why he allowed himself to do what he did.
Who gives a flying donkey, people make mistakes and we move on. Geezaloo this generation is too soft, and sensitive.
4:57 he’s only human after all… don’t put the blame on him.
Will Imarriedaskank Smith.  RIP fresh prince, well, may as well be dead, his career is.
I break the spirit of MKultra .... Be free
whoopie sez it be all rayciss if it happens to a person of color.
Will you don't me but I saw a interview with you by Jay Shetty and he didn't mentioned the incident. Now I know why, you did it in this video. All the judgements below of being a actor, bla bla bla; I can say only one word about this video: Respect  🙏
🤮
Whatever people say….. I appreciate the fact that you came forward to appologize for the mistake that you have realised.  Past is past, everone should move forward. Everyone will move forward. Well done King…. Well done
Even tho he apologize will should be ashamed of himself because of that
Will Robot lol
No don't apologize to ANYONE ELSE. Just Chris. Don't act like Jada's expression didn't make you act like that. This apology is fake af.
Everybody has done something as bad or worse and you know it. The only difference is that Will did it in front of a camera. Stop the hate.

Fail!!!
what you need is an acceptance
Phony.
Will, we love you.  And dats it!!

Why does Will read this like he just now learned how to read?
Can't believe this guy's coocoo for Niobe's nutty Coco Puffs, despite how much they get around. If only my child self knew the "cool" guy from Independence Day was actually a lunatic like this. One of the biggest human disappointments in Hollywood history.
You're not a POS. I hope you and Chris work things out.
ok now do it without a teleprompter and actually care.
odd. Isn't he supposed to be an actor? why this feel so damn fake?
just weak
The problem is you can never tell when your acting or not? do you know when your acting or not?
Will I would be happy to be banned by the Academy. Look at that institution and what they turn people into. I’m glad you got out. They support elites and pedos. I love watching to see all the big actresses and actors win. But we have to remember that the heart of these big elite award shows are your soul. Be glad that you got out before they took yours away.
Also one other thing Will. Don't give a crap about what The Academy thinks.  These are the same people that hate natives and support pedophiles. You're better off without them.
Don't be like that, to make mistakes is human and you had the courage to go public and apologize, now it's time to move on.
It's funny how many people sh1t on Will, yet would do EXACTLY the same thing in defence of their spouse.
No longer a fan. You suck will
😅

I know people say this came to late but at least he's trying to fix it. He had no right to do what he did but he trying to make it right
2:50 lie!!
dk
but forgiving
its sad
hm
You will definitely bounce back. People will be people. It’s funny because the accusers are quick to speak than to listen. 😅Forgiveness is what everyone in this sinful world needs. The Bible 1 John 1:8  “If we claim to be without sin, we deceived ourselves and the truth is not in us” the beautiful example is shown when Jesus questioned the accusers in John 8:7  “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” - And Guess what?! They all walked away 😂… Keep your head up… forgive yourself , forgive others MOST importantly so that grace can be extended unto you. 🤍 Much love Will! 😊
Love this man Thank you for all you did fresh prince You are the LEGEND! ❤
There is a big difference between saying "I apologize" and "I'm sorry" "I'm sorry" indicates actual regret.
Will smith  sorry
You need someone to give you a real insight and guidance from outside of your team.
The only way to fix this: BUDDY COMEDY WITH YOU AND CHRIS. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITE ACTORS. PEACE.
Eat like a king who's on a budget Three tasty options: fries, drinks and nuggets All for five bucks (Wait, that can't be right?)

blech 🤮
Hey Will, you sue Chris and we are done dude. Period.   Man up
Regardless of what anyone says I still love Will Smith. I've had moments of high stress in my life especially dealing with a spouse and would've done anything just to end up keeping them from either humiliating me or causing an argument. Now what he did obviously was heavily disrespectful but I won't sit here and act like I don't like him anymore. I hope he mentally gets better and eventually provides himself with the love he needs.
You only think it was wrong because it’s now ruined your rep with the world. The happy nice celeb dude is all a front. The real you shows in times of frustration
CLM 🍋
A+ YouTube apology. That scripted sigh at the start was such a good touch, but next time try maybe even a little bit to make it not sound fake and rehearsed.
I love how he slowly reads the fan questions, as if he is reading them for the first time!😂😂. I guess we’re supposed to believe he didn’t have a team of individuals that coached him through the well rehearsed responses?
he said I apologize to Chris but sorry to his Family,  wanna bet were gonna over analyze every word.
The best part about this video is the comments section 😂😂😂
I’m french, i ve just watch your video, i’m happy to ear that, i hope Chris will answer and that everything will be ok again ;-) thank you for MIB !

And you! You know what, you need to listen and listen good! I've come here before and told you how to fix things not only for yourself but other men. You refuse to step up as well, why?  I'm having a really hard time being able to have respect for you as a man. I told you who to go to to help yourself and so you could help other men, but you didn't do it, did you?  My words fell on deaf ears because you assume you know better. If you really want to fix your problems Elliot Hulse, Casey Zander and David Hammond can help you. They could help you more but they have some of the same bad attitude you do, so mostly I just want to tell them to 💨 me.   I came to YouTube, did the work, got ignored and called things like a feminist. Just because you are Will Smith, Casey Zander, David Hammond, Elliot Hulse, doesn't mean that you are all so above everyone else that you can just ignore what I'm saying.   Me having respect for you as a man, most likely means very little to you, I use to be a big fan, now I just see you as a man that needs help and won't go get it. You wanna feel better and get your life in order, they are a big part of how you can do that!   You might be Will Smith but you are not worthy of me coming here all the time to save your bass and have you ignore me. Only the best men can hear me even a little bit, it's one of the few ways I test men. I give them common sense amd logic and see if they can hear it. And I'm so annoyed with self righteous pansies who hide rather then step up and do what needs to be done.
All i heard was me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me.
Bro go see Joe Rogan live and see if you get triggered. I bet the house you don't do that #coward
Thank you Will. That means a lot
"The Broad Street Bully" (Double entre word play on you being from Philly and your hometown nickname hockey team in the 80s). I'm only joking to make you make you feel better.
Damn will
Apology videos are when you know it’s over! 🤣
Dang y’all-  let the one with no Sin cast the first stone.
❤🙏☦️
not gonna lie This comes across like a PR apology. Doesn't feel real
Will: "I am deeply devoted and committed to putting light, and love, and joy into the world. But even more so, I am deeply committed to keeping my WIFE'S NAME OUT YA FUCKIN MOUTH!!"
Fake🤡
ok everyone, stop punishing this man , this  man truly is trying to make the wrong right. i think hes been through enough. lord says do not hold a grudge. so just let it go. lets forgive the man and carry on. so will, i think you have done all you can do so win back your fans. I still watch your shows so chin up im not the only one who is rooten for ya.
😄
OMG I was so disappointed when I saw the incident but this video made things so much worse. He used to be such a nice guy. I guess that happens when you are under a narcissistic snake's power for so long. (Am I the only one that thinks she actually resembles a real snake in looks and actions?) I hope one day the real Will Smith reappears.😢😢😢
Made one of my favorite movies: I Am Legend.
Love is the cure <3 <3 <3
https://youtube.com/shorts/r4nlUJfW06Q?feature=share
He made a big mistake but we have to be able provide forgiveness.
OMG like man don’t fight. It’s ok if a man wants to protect his wife’s name. Probably better be done via speech, not fight, but it’s no the end of the world. Will Smith is a good guy.
You don't apologize for nothing you cry baby
Keep Chris' name out yo mf moufff lmao  You sorry sista
People need to man  up stuff has even done and that what matters you might hate him but don't start changing people's views as people do ussaly
One of the fakest apology videos I ever seen. 😅 But even this is proof that, after all, you remain a very good actor.
You got BURNED by Chris on stage 🤣
Mr. Smith sir are you ok? You have been MIA for a while & I'm just wondering where you are , Sir. I am hearing unpleasant rumours, Sir.
You know all this hate is messing with his head bad right now too
A grown man who is entitled, narcissistic and a bully and a punk at the same time.
Never feel the same way about will smith again…what a waste
What ever happened to the real fun will Smith? Apparently adulting isn't in his cards. Way too much drama. Grow up already, you've shamed your children and your fans... I'm truly not interested in watching any of the reruns nor new movies he puts out.  GROW UP DUDE
I wish I was watching this with Charlie from Poker Face
All I see is a bunch of people shaming you for the one mistake you have made even though you have done a bunch of good deeds In my opinion people who loose faith in someone who has done one mistake have never actually been supportive…
Biggest L in entertainment
You threw away a beautiful career and the respect of millions. Heartbreaking.
Deep sh7t
Let me down dude growing up i seen you as a hero im 21 now all i see is a broken man who chooses not to climb out a hole he dug himself in to
Douche
coward
Why am I watching this lol morbid curiosity i guess
Never watching anything you are in ever again. Despicable piece of wasted dna.
I believe him!
💗💗💗
There are people that still take this apology seriously wtf He is good at his job but that doesn't change the fact that he has some really bad personality issues, which can clearly be seen in his toxic family. This theatrical apology, typical of toxic youtubers makes me laugh
IF IT COULD ON;LY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN JUST A MINUTE!!!  MAYBE TO NEVER EVER HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN!
Over it. Forgive yourself. No more of this. Continue doing and being better. You're a Great Man! 😊
2023 and I am just seeing this video after watching Jorner Lucas's song to will titled "WILL."  Seeing all the insults people hurl at you breaks my heart, and watching Chris Rock's "Selective Outrage" hurts in multiple ways. He said many insensitive things; I understand this is his way of getting back at you.   I only hope "Will" is okay.  I am certain that you will recover strongly; you always do, which is why you are my idol and role model.
Will Smith has lost all my respect as a human being. He should come out of her wife's shadow, she is the worst.
Well now you can, I gave a 👎
#SoFAKE
Im sorry BABE even if you sleep with Jaden friend
You don’t need to live up to anyone’s expectations. You’re just human. Thank you for your life’s work, sincerely

I’m still waiting for Gi jay 2
I use to like Will Smith. That's all I will say after being a huge fan of everything he has done. With all the smirks going on with this "Presidential Speech" makes me feel like he meant none of it... All I know is if a "friend" hurt me, and all I got was a social media response for an apology, I'd be pissed.
You hurt some of your fans too by your actions. Hope you bounce back soon Hancock. 💪💯

This week mf apologies to the one who dogged him out in front of the world...she got this man on a leash at the house
Bruh.....YOU LAUGHED UNTILL YOU SAW YOUR CHICK ROLLING HER EYES
When the teachers pet gets in trouble and thinks a weak apology can fix it
God bless you.
The fact that he so desperately tries to please everyone, is probably the reason he snapped in that moment...
This is way too over produced and rehearsed to the point of insincerity. You're better than this Will. You're a better actor than this.   Shake Rocks hand in public say im sorry to him and us...and move on.  It's that simple.  Its simple if you get that it's not humiliating if you mean it and it's what a real person of quality would do. Good luck Will.
Lol
Dear Will, I am not a "Youtube" person. In 14(ish?) years I've never made a comment on this site. A lot of people are being critical, a lot of people are spreading fanatical hate and/or love. I just want to say you have been a huge part of my life. You, via media, have helped me live, laugh and cry. I was heartbroken by your actions that night. I forgive you. I hope you can forgive yourself, too.  Your on-screen relationship with James Avery in Fresh Prince meant the world to me growing up without a father figure in my life.I recall a very hard time in my life, where you and James taught me that mistakes happen, and not only can the people around you forgive you, but you can forgive yourself. I appreciate you owning that your behavior was wrong. We all make mistakes, Will. I hope you forgive yourself. I hope Chris forgives you, and I hope you both can heal from it.
It should have been never.
Piffle
Chris cooked the hell out of you man.
He should be ashamed of himself.  But he says he doesn't want to feel ashamed of himself?!?!?!?  That is what is wrong with this "apology".  It felt more like an attempt at mitigating his heinous act.  Really makes me mad!
Trying to mitigate with damage control.

How embarrassing and humiliating must’ve felt for him to do this. But again, he’s lost jobs and he’s gotta feed the family 😆
We've ALL made mistakes, it's only because yours was on television that people keep making you feel as though you aren't human, and had a human emotion. We love you, and totally understand that life caught up with you, in that moment. 💜🧡💛💚💙💝
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
None of us are our worst day, our worst behavior. Continue to learn and grow through all this. Thank you for being open and sharing. You are a good person and you are loved!
I love you brother, I hope you heal and find peace.
Mental Healness YouTube channel can really help you
I don’t judge man, you reacted in the moment when you lady was being disrespected. You did it, now whatever happens. Keep your head up. You are human and make mistakes. I don’t think more or less of you.
Will smith is an example of why NO ONE should ever glorify a celebrity.
Ahh the classic heat of the moment excuse grow up
You're done, Will. Retire.
It doesn’t matter it’s all apart of the Illuminati’s plan, it was staged anyways, this was also probably staged.
He must be hurting from when he couldn't help his mom in childhood.  Nobody was there for him then.
Good apology
Isn't there a Illuminati procedure for this kind of situation? Is YouTube apology video part of it?
What's been done can't be undone
Man will you can tell this is just you trying to save your own career You thought you was untouchable until you started getting all this backlash
Dude f#cked up and apologized. Maybe its time everyone moved on .
I honestly think he handled this pretty well. It’s not like he committed war crimes on Hawaii.
LoL will 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
I Haven’t Given Up On You Will Smith. That’s Never Going To Change. Ever.
We all have different opinions about what is necessary. It seems to me that it is now a norm to make unnecessary public apologies.
All of this is between you and Chris and none of my business. Take your fake apology and shove it.
CLM 🍋✊
Everyone that is hating on Will Smith will one day understand how he feels, in this life or the next, The Karmic Cycle.
We love you Will!❤️
All's forgiven. Keep on performing as an actor.
Good very nice smith 👍
Wow best apology video. No dislikes at all!
This video has more Dislikes than likes🤣🤣🤣🤣
there no amount of apologies that can resurrect his dead career
Watching this in 2023. I think and believe that this is as sincere of an apology that a person can express. Those who still hold this against Will must be without sin.
Will I understand that you were blinded by your anger and its OK, stop beating yourself up it happens you only human everybody make mistake people are always gonna ask why and how disappointed they are but they haven't walk your shoes they haven't lived your life and they don't know was going with you or in your private life at home. For now live your life as you have been, working hard and showing love. People still love and respect you. So have a great day and love, peace and respect from your Puerto Rican brother. Felt like I had to write this. ✌️
For anyone still hating Will for his past mistake,  just remember that forgiveness is key in all aspects of life. We are all saints and sinners at some point in this human experience! Am sure he has learnt his lessons
He's such a good actor he can pretend to be insincere and we all believe it! He's so good at acting..! ..He's... acting.. right....?
Disklike Ratio for those who cant view - 120K likes vs 281k dislikes... (last update Feb 2023)
I really don't care that he's a good actor he made me believe. I want to believe. Thank you William.
I hope you find yourself Mr. Smith. I have been in the pit and climbed out. Shedding who I was trying to really be was a battle. Your answers are deep inside you not what others expect you to be. Each one of our unique selves needs to shine without the input of others. Answers come from within.
Is never too late to change
He did the write thing
Welcome back !!
Dang, some people STILL MAD. We're part animal. Crap like this happens. Stop acting like celebrities are gods. They're stinking humans like us.
No accountability at all
Dear will smith I idolize you your the best how did you meet do jazzy Jeff and how did you become a rapper have a nice day❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ok 🐱
You lost me as a fan
Chris has  embarrassed and demeaned  a lot of people over the years... he never apologized for anything. At least Will Smith is human enough and man enough to apologize. Sending you love Will. You'll always be a wonderful person and role model to us.
Nice fake apology
we too poor to care.....
Shame is a useful feeling. One should feel shame when they hurt someone else. Shameful behaviour is not the same as shameful person. That’s the trauma effect.
stop it get some help
I forgive you will, Chris should've picked up that phone.
Will, u did nothing wrong my man!!!! Take care of yourself and be healthy!!
They need to leave Will alone. He is a human being. He made a mistake. I have always liked Will Smith. There is something that is hurting deep inside this man. You are not a piece of poo!   I don’t know if Will is going to see this, but if you ask God for forgiveness, forgive yourself and ask Chris to forgive you. That’s all that matters.
Man you are forever one of my personal hero’s thank you for how graceful you handled your life love you man I’m sorry that you wanted to protect your spouse and it exploded in the ways that it has
You made a mistake. Everybody does. People should get over it. Don't be any harder on yourself. You're still one of my favourite people on TV.
💛 still a fan of yours like any other out there. i hope one day you and him will make peace. take care of yourself and the ones you cherrish ;) from montreal, canada
You’re secure; you’re wealthy…..you don’t have to be in the camera.  Produce, manage, work behind the scenes like Spielberg and the rest of those cats.  Don’t be a on screen button pusher; street sweeper.  If you can’t go in the doors that those cats use; go independent.  Put it behind; don’t grovel…..start the next chapter
If Will has taught me anything throughout the years is that we all will make mistakes of different sizes but they don't define us its how we respond and react after the mistake that defines us. This man changed my life and I will always support and love him
A questão é simples o cara defendeu a mulher por outro cara fazer piadas para ter curtida. Ao meu ver ganhou o troféu de marido do ano.  Fechado com o Smith
Как актёр и человек для меня, увы...
I prefer to believe this was a sincere apology from Will and that he is going to be better. I will not crucify him because of one bad (REALLY BAD) moment in his life. We all make mistakes, but it's up to us to be better or walk in the same path.
Dump that tramp you have brother.
I think it's okay for an apology video to be scripted. As long it is genuine and has good points they ain't making stuff up
It’s rewind time!
Don’t worry we all make mistakes I forgot it happened until I saw this today most people I know forgive you also I do to
Thanks for doing this, I completely felt everything you shared and I hope others can feel the sincerity that I felt and heard. I know how much it took and could feel how much it took to make this video. As a fan I appreciate this so much and I can completely understand as humans we have and will continue as along as we're alive to make mistakes. It's not the mistakes that we make that defines who we are it's what we do with what we learned from the mistakes we made going forward. Stay strong brotha...   Ray & The Harris Family
we made mistakes but we consider important the way we consider that mistake after a reflection then what's happened in a moment of irreflection
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Кто смотрит это видео что бы выучить английский?
It’s difficult to get back reputation, trust and good Will although good will is easy to Represent
Dear Will, I’m from Philly, been a longtime fan. I completely understand that something Chris said triggered you and you lost it/snapped. Furthermore, the part of you that was triggered (the rage) was probably very blended into your core self after the fact so that you couldn’t completely separate from it. I hope and pray you can find a good IFS Therapist in your area and you can heal the wounded parts of your psyche. Please go into this type of healing, in a year or so you’ll see many positive changes. All the best, I’m praying for you 🙏

in Brazil they sided with Will and were against Chris. Funny, isn't it?
Best apology on the internet. Because he actually means it. Logan Paul could learn something.
TRICKNOLOGY AND ILLUSIONS FOR THE CONVULSIONS AT ITS BEST.                                      Well if it isn't SAM COOK OPPS! eye mean WILL SMITH the eye don't lie.     Eu can Fool the Peephole Sometimes but eu Can't Fool the Peephole Oll the time.                                      FACTS OVA FEELINGS!
You spent all your life with thousands of hours of work and sleepless nights to become what you are and the role model everyone looked up to, only to lose it in 10 seconds... Such a "bruh" moment right there. I don't blame Chris for not forgiving you yet... I don't think many people will any time soon.
...he said sorry I think its all good
We all make mistake, thats how we learn from them
Go. Away.
Sorry Will, but your entire Press team can’t help you here. You really doesn’t seams to understand what happened that evening with Chris, and the impact your behavior had to the world.  Your words don’t sound honestly, and playing the victim is very misplaced.
I grew up with Will Smith and I understand a moment where things slip. He is still human and we are all human. We have all made catastrophic mistakes and we all request to be forgiven. The only reason this is such a huge thing is because he is a national star and he did it on a national form. Not saying what he did was right or that the punishment he received was wrong but I understand and I will still be a Will Smith follower. I pray for you will and hope that this will be a life lesson.
Lost respect in regards to smit
This might be controversial, but guys, I think this apology is actually pretty good
You're humain. And I made some horrible mistakes and I didn't have to apologize to the hate of the entire world. I love you more because I know you really, really want to be a role model. But you are a person and only human.
You are human. You seem to be a role model for women, men, children and the like. We have all had our moments. Be strong and prayerful!
Hey man we are all human. We all F up occasionally.  That was a good smack though lol.
Rise! We love you, dude! Chris talked too much.
Am glad to see noone in the comments buying this charade.
@callum first of all Will Smith is one of the nicest rappers in the world this man don’t even cuss in his wraps he has never really had a situation like this and we are all just human no matter how nice you are you can only take so much before you at the same time it was absolutely wrong for will to handle that way but as a person who has been backed in a corner before I understand but it’s a two sided sword when you are a black man in America Jim Carrey can go and be weird and disrespectful and sexually harassing but verbally an actor publicly and make herself look like a absolute lunatic and white America has no problem letting all that go and giving him all the opportunities to play in every movie that’s coming in Hollywood there is a double standard let’s not get it twisted remember what country.
Haha salute
😂😂😂😂 As Bill Murr said, "he had to go all the way to india so now he's all healed up" 💀 bro get some help
Mr Smith. I may not be the superfan who has your image all over my house...but I have watched all your movies. I have listened to your motivational speeches.  The pressure to appear as the perfect gentleman at all times...must be immense. I don't think any of us who haven't led the celebrity life can understand this.  You lost your temper. It was improper conduct...and it was caught in one of the most public settings possible.   I still believe that you are an honest hardworking man who puts his family first. I will keep praying for you.  My word of advise is. Do not sit to long beating yourself over this mistake. Failures are the stepping stones to success.  Best wishes Mr Will Smith. Compliments of the season.
I feel like this whole idea of growth through spiritually and healing is counterproductive. Sometimes you just own up to your mistakes and say you behaved like an idiot. I think personal growth is possible but honestly it seems like Will needs a reality check, which is probably difficult when you’re surrounded by Hollywood’s best shrinks and therapists- it seems to just add to the narcissism.
Woah that PR team told you to do that right
Will made a big mistake, but this should not define him. He's been such a positive man and brought us so many good vibes throughout the years. I hope he can take all this like a champ and come out better and stronger than ever. 💪
Good apology. Just now realizing this happened (the apology). Hope the healing comes to completion.  Much love, Will Smith.
hahaha the parasocial relationship at the end "i promise we'll be able to be friends again" okay
get help. leave hollywood. it's messed up your brain
u r lucky u didn't mess with the wrong person
I almost forgot to unsubscribe to this channel. Good luck Will.
Your only sorry because no one wants to hire you after it
Fake AF
I think I'll read your book now.  Thanks Will
Pô Will, você errou feio. Mas você tem o meu perdão. E um dia terá o perdão do Chris.
🙄🙄🙄 scripted apology... Sorry but NO!
CLM ✊🍋
I’m enough of a fan that I don’t want this to be end… this to shall pass… and we will see you on top once again… ❤
It takes a man to realise he’s wrong. Good on you will. Learn from it and move forward brother.
Will has undergone his full YouTuber arc which is the infamous “apology video” 😭😭😭
bro talks slower than a turtle
I know you don't need my forgiveness or that any YouTube comment is going to matter or make the difference on your journey.  But EVERYBODY screws up big time in their lives.  EVERYBODY has done one big thing in their life they regret.  You are not alone on that journey. We are human and I think you can be a great example to the world especially today of what being human really means.  Peace n light brother
More than anything this was really disappointing. I loved Will as an actor, and still do. I was really disappointed in Will the human.
Yeah Chris is just making money off the situation, stay true will!
As one of your fan, i forgive you Will. I wish you the best. I wish that Chris will have the strenght to forgive you too. Everybody makes mistakes. I hope this experience made you a better human ❤.
Will. No one is perfect; we all make mistakes. Dont let that moment define the rest of your life. Dont listen to the naysayers who think they can look into your heart and say your apology is fake. The fact that you did it with a lot of thought into it. You addressed the hard questions honestly. I can see the emotion and sincerity. Ultimately only God knows and he created repentance because he knows we all mess up.  Read The Gates of Repentance / Teshuvah and focus on making yourself a better man and healing. Keep your head to the grind stone and eventually you will walk in the light again. You CAN make it right. We all can. Dont give up because people want to tell you your not sorry enough. Only you know. Always one of your fans
hey slappie my man
He’s just reading of a teleprompter… 😅
Wife's puppet
Your canceled in my book
Sorry bud but at 1:19 the subtitles are supposed to be Chris’ not Chris’s.
Respect 🇯🇲
Whipped until the 3rd Generation! Grow a pair man 😂
Enserio.. si yo fuera uno de los amigos o conocidos de Will, siempre que el caminara hacia mí o me mirara, daría, como mínimo, un paso hacia atrás
you saying that you making choices on your own but let me tell you YOU ARE NOT... she's hijacked you from the begining and even making you think that you are making all of your choices but trust me  you are not... My advice would be to get as away from her as possible... I would say like she's the charles manson of the story... get away bro just get awaay!!
What is he apologiseing for?  Did he do something bad?  I don't understand
There is only some much that can done after the incident. Will apologized and it’s time to move on.
you have a big heart  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Human.  So I’m good. Anyone else still being pissy…check your own history. Let he who is among you without sin…
At least it’s better than Travis Scott apology
Phoniex
He didn’t apologise to his fans or the people that looked up to him. Instead it’s an elite level apology focused on all the high class celebs that were in the room that night. He still hasn’t apologised to us for letting us down. None of that in any of the Emancipation interviews either.
We love you will smith
Ur trash
That wasn't a real apology.  He should go to his house and apologize, like a man.
Well done on getting the strength to apologise. Even though you know people would probably not buy it and that your apology could never erase your dreadful behaviour.
Was there any $cientology input into this?    lol - damaged
Will, Brother you have nothing to apologise for! Nothing. If someone disrespects, insults someone you love & cherish. Feck, I’d break his teeth. You had all right to smash his face in. In the immortal words of Malcolm X,  ‘Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery’
People are so happy to take an interest and ask questions but then when he addresses them publicly, they complain that its staged, it shouldn't be on youtube etc etc.
Thank you sir for providing CONTENT for the Meme channels ❤️‍🩹
Its incredible how judgemental and unforgiving people are. As if they are perfect and have never made horrible mistakes or lapses in judgement before. Or the people who are hypocritical about who they give the benefit of the doubt to.   Will Smith is a good person, who had an awful moment. The key word is moment, not lifestyle. Except unlike us regular joe’s and even some celebs, Will had his terrible moment in front of millions of viewers.   If we had read about this happening in some news article and it wasn’t televised, it wouldn’t have gotten the attention it did and some people would have even questioned whether it was true or not. But it didn’t happen that way.   So guess what? The world saw that, surprise, Will Smith is a flawed human being, just like the rest of us. People can stand on their fake “holier than thou” platforms if they want.  But we all know some of the most vile people are doing things that will never be televised.   Any sane person can look at the way this man looked before he even started talking and see that he is still doing his own soul searching. He’s still trying to forgive himself.   When we see people who are truly remorseful and expressing it, instead of assuming the worst, we need to start giving them the space to change. What people like Will need in those moments are love, support and encouragement. Not condemnation by people who are just as flawed.  Will Smith, you are still loved, supported and have a voice that this world needs. Stay strong and stay encouraged brother.
liar liar,
How can you be sorry for something that you feel no remorse for or no shame if you don't feel shame or remorse it's hard to believe that you are sorry at all. You're an actor and you can't even make a sincere apology! Your apology did not seem all that heart felt to me just my opinion
Is the only reason Will Smith apologized is because it hurt his career I've always loved Will Smith in everything he's done after that incident I realized he's an actor the real Will Smith looks like he's not a nice guy like he acts I really wanted to believe that Will Smith was that nice guy
I hope u get to experience the same thing at the same stage. Then only u will know the insult chris fared on that day on an international platform.
It's really the Legend 😅😅😅
Will your a disgrace to your people. Your mother would be ashamed of you.
?Will, when I saw you in that air plane outfit jumping from that plane with Maxwell, ? What happened to you, do you remember? Not sure why he was bothering you, I remember you from Fresh Prince. ? Doesn't Noah Trevor remind you of Maxwell?
Stop the cap.
You know someone is a professional YouTuber when they've done at least one "YouTuber apology video(™)"
its too late, u was role model of me and i also still ashemed of myself
Parabéns por reconhecimento de seu erro, esse é um grande passo. Hoje em dia é muito fácil condenar o outro, realizar condenações com um alto índice de hipócrita. Nós meros mortais não temos que juntar por suas atitudes. O mais importante é evoluir como ser humano. E sempre pedir para ser guiado pelo amor de Deus 🙏🙏
Top class acting, i give it 9.8/10
NOOB
‘There is no part of me which thinks that is right.’ Well you did it didn’t you
Fake, all of it fake. Horribly fake. Will Smith, I'd rather believe all the memes over this.
that baseball cap 🤣
Will... if you happen to read this thirty thousand and three hundred and fifty-second comment, I can tell you aren't acting your normal self; "The Will Smith everyone sees all the time".  The pain and hurt in your eyes are tangible.  Your apology is real.  I accept your apology and you are forgiven.  My uncle used to say, "It won't matter in another fifty years anyway."  There is wisdom in that statement.  With God's grace, we all goin' to git through this.  I mean that.  Just be genuinely you without any Ajax tryin' to clean things up disingenuously.  Peace.  🤜🏻 🤛🏿
Look, If anyone who has seen this has ever been so appalled by their own actions, they would understand. Leave the man alone, the beef is between him and Chris. He likely only made a public apology for his fans, and cause he cares what folks think about him. His fame IS tied with his success. Their are no good words to speak to atone for what he did and the man clearly doesn't know what to say. Fake? No, he just started recording and spoke from the bottom of his heart with what came to mind. It's as real as it gets, end of story. That said, i don't blame Chris from not wanting to deal with and move on, If i was him i would be doing the same.

Drizzle yellow mustard and a portion of remaining diced onion over the meat sauce. Repeat with remaining hot dogs.

Where is the admission to entitlement as a celebrity?
this glock 45 came with a switch...
I've said it before and Ill say it again. The worlds uproar was simply a testament to your exceptional character. But your human and imperfect and really need to be shown grace. Thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do.
He did something very wrong, that's inquestionable... But people need to chill the hell out and be more forgiving IMO
What is remorse without shame, sincerely?
He deserved it 💀✋🏻
Will you have never fell out of favor with me. I grew up on your shows, movies and music. I forgive you and no judgment here or disappointment her. We are human and make mistakes. ❤❤❤❤
IDGAF
anyone else would be in jail. period.
Sh1thead
I feel sorry for celebrities man they are expected to act superhuman which is impossible will reacted how many others normal human beings would react why does he have to be dragged for normal human behavior
What was,the issue with Chris that Will talked about ?
Will Smith is sooo Fake!!
I except your apology Will!  You are a great actor, but the genuine humility in your voice and tone, and the fact that you took time to reflect instead of immediately going on an apology tour, shows me you are sincere not to mention you never showed to be a person of disrespect before  now.  We are all human and make mistakes.  Sending you and your family Love!
He didn't apologize during his acceptance speech because he thought he had gotten away consequence free after no one did anything at that moment.  Will Smith is trash.
It's alright and everything, but I'm not buying the "I was fogged out"  bs.
I am still applauding Chris on how he reacted to that niqqa moment.
Carnal i am sorry to say this but don’t ever protect I person that don’t love you that’s how I see it why bother on a relation that’s done I wish you the best God bless you and your family saludos from San Antonio tx
Man you made big songs big movies u have great body and cute / hot, etc. Lets go man you my idol probably not only me
Yeah okay you apologize when are the next episode of Bel-Air coming out? The man that show was fire you never did anything wrong so let's move on bring out some more episodes of the new Bel-Air then we can be friends again LOL
Yes it has been a minute, cuckold
5 minutes only!
2:35 Lmao he said not an “optimal” way to behave. So it was still a decent way?
Will you better get that memory wiper thing he used in men in black
Love you will you the best actor
You did a shitty thing in a moment of madness and it won’t be forgotten but that having all been said, I have made mistakes and so has everyone.  You have apologised and now it is time to get of the apology train and do what you have been doing for a long long time and give people great entertainment and let people learn with you on this and make you their role model again. Keep head up high.  Just be there when Chris is ready to talk (not on tv) but between you and him.  😀.
4:55 man that seems a bit narcissistic. I am a human too i did mistakes and im trying to learn from that i have changed it is more easily for me to say sorry anymore
U didn’t let me down
Take your time. We don’t want you back.
It’s funny how he doesn’t want to be hard on himself.  I’m sure he believes in some psychology that prevents shame.
You are a wise man, Will. We all felt with You during those days. Maybe we can all dare to be brave enough to focus on our own mistakes rather than the ones other people make. May we all one day be as self-reflected and big as You are.
I love you Will! You're such a beautiful soul and you had a moment so freaking what?  Everybody needs to get over it! Will you are still Amazing! We ain't canceling Will Smith PERIOD!
You didn't sign a prenup Will. Clearly
likes to dislikes
You're a great guy Will
It's OK "Will" Chillax
It's been a minute... ???WTF did they change the title??
Nah man. You were once an idol, but not anymore. It still ain’t cool what you did.
One of our greatest! Now and forever! The warriors accept the heaviest burdens.  Keep your head towards HEAVEN.
not buying it
Anything Will Smith gets a thumb down!
I lost all respect I had for Will Smith but hey we all make mistakes. Passion is central to our being. I think it could happen to anyone at the lowest point in our lives. I sure as heck wouldn't want to reach that point. This is a learning experience for everyone. Thanks Will for this effort. I know you're getting a lot of flak for even apologizing. Heal and get well soonest and continue what you've always done best, acting.
Blink 3x if you're publicist is holding a gun off camera Will.  😂 You're going to be fine, just get yourself together, I know your private life is different than most, but you need to seek help sometimes for these things
It ain’t hate if it’s black on black crime.
Unfortunately being remorseful does require yourself to have shame, that's the point of it, humility is part of growing a better character, and as we age, the more humility we have, the more empathy we develop towards others in life then our souls can be free of any guilt from having something others don't whether it be material, skills, talent, money, whatever
He sounds genuine enough, I believe that he’s sorry
Power to You will! Not that people are not mad at u but I believe in forgiveness as a higher virtue
✨✨✨💫👑🫵🏾🌺✊🏾💫✨✨✨
Still love Will 😊
I'm sad that so many people will watch this all the way through and then join in the excuses. I turned ot off.
If really listen to Will’s choice of words, it’s obvious that he’s much more focused on getting the viewer to feel bad for him / making justifications for his behavior than simply apologizing.   I’m far more disappointed now than I was when he first struck Chris.
What happened happened Will. It’s okay, we all make mistakes and the steps of mindfulness you are taking are the best thing that will help with all of these emotions. I think we all gotta remember that we’re just human. And we all are on this planet together, and to make mistakes is the way too learn. Your awesome man continue what your doing. 🙂
All fake act...it was done before in the golden globe what ever it is called awards...go look it up. It is a ritual!
The best way to show that you’re sorry is to not do it again. The best way to show that we’ve learned from our mistakes is to not make those same mistakes again.
I forgive you, but always remember this dk history won’t repeat itself.
I love will smith and out of his whole career this man has been amazing!! Impactful and a role model for his community and other community!! Not a lot of people accomplish what he have.. and he is human and everyone has their breaking point.. so if you guys will just blackball this man on this one mistake out of all the good he has done.. you never cared in the first place and you’re fake.. I love you and you’re family be blessed will ❤
Bro sounds like a robot at the start
Я считаю, он поступил как мямля, пришел на ковер и объясняет всем как школьник что и почему. Как мне кажется, ему стоило поступить следующим образом:  1. Лично извиниться перед Крисом, когда тот будет готов. Или отправить сообщение/письмо. 2. Если помирились, сделать совместную фотку и выложить ее в соцсети с подписью вроде "мы все уладили :)" Если не общались и не помирились, кратко оповестить мир, что "я жалею о содеянном, отправил письмо Крису, надеюсь, он выйдет на связь". 3. Сделать пост или записать КОРОТКОЕ видео с посылом извинения за то, что он испортил людям вечеринку и бросил тень на церемонию (ой ли? Рейтинги взлетели), ясно и коротко, "был неправ, сорян". И не с видом побитой собаки, а с чувством достоинства, что он как мужчина понимает свою ошибку и стойко встречает последствия.  А то как по мне выходит типичная для школы ситуация: тихоня заехал задире под глаз и в итоге его заставили перед ним прилюдно извиниться, хотя задира очень даже заслужил.  Цитата "...сколько людей пострадало" -- Ой, ну прям вообще, неизгладимая психологическая травма у всех разом. Столько слов, столько извинений, как будто он похитил пятнадцать младенцев и ставил над ними опыты. Перегиб. 🤦🏻 Мужики были, есть и будут отыгрываться на физиономиях друг друга, и что, каждый увидевший это страшно страдает? К тому же, это была лишь пощечина как акт унижения, а не кулаком в нос, чтоб перелом, кровь, сопли, слезы и слюни, молчу уже о преступном добивании ногами. Я смотрю, американцы любят раздувать из мухи слона и закрывать глаза на реального слона, усердно делая вид, что его не замечают.  Другое дело, что можно было оставить это на закулесье, крикнуть Крису, мол, "я с тобой после шоу поговорю, а сейчас Нормально извинись перед моей женой, или бла бла бла", можно и без "или".  Нужно думать, что и кому ты говоришь, и отвечать за свои слова. А то, видите ли, при толпе обидно шутить можно, а получить леща за это -- нельзя, сразу вонь поднимается. Похоже на то, что черные заигрались с черными. Черным можно говорить то, за что осудят белого, можно наезжать на другого черного так, как нельзя белому. И в этих заигрываниях упустили чувство меры и такта.  Бравый мужик-ведущий пошутил над женщиной и огреб от бравого мужика-мужа, а мужик-муж теперь сидит и унижается. Интересно, какого жене из-за этого, он ее как бы защитил, а потом побежал видяшки-извиняшки записывать (опустим, что она токсик и тиран; просто, сам факт такой последовательности событий). Джада будет чмырить его после этого ещё сильнее.   А у мамы Криса не прощения нужно просить, а сказать, чтоб великовозрастного сына научила чему-то большему, чем шуткам за 300. Все-таки в обществе давно сложены представления о том, какими в большинстве своем себя хотят видеть женщины и мужчины; женщины не хотят быть лысыми, а мужчины иметь маленький член. Так же тупо и бестактно шутить над, не знаю, прыщами, инвалидностью, кривыми зубами, картавостью и тд, если не известно отношение "жертвы" к этому состоянию. Если сам комик один из них, пусть шутит о себе, не задевая других, и может кто-то словит интересное наблюдение и тоже посмеется.   Борьба с "токсичной" маскулинностью приводит к тому, что мужчины становятся мямлями, нытиками, слабаками и хлюпиками, эстрогеновыми лошадками. А женщины в ответ на это грубыми, мужеподобными, агрессивными тестостероновыми конями. И в итоге получаем больное, извращенное общество.  Уилл, ну чего ты, ты ж нормальный мужик, бросай свою мегеру, не ведись на провокации, хватит придумывать причины быть виноватым и извиняться за это, иди к психотерапевту. Найди свои яйца, в конце концов. Иначе тебя сожрут.
Please give me my career back😂
Won't watch another movie that's you are in. Can't understand why they didnt kick you out! You are a has been.  😒
The guy still can't say what really happened.   I'm sorry, you've been my idol for years..for years ! A Fat Indian orphan  kid who used to watch 'Bad boys ' , ' men in black" , POH ...etc..  This just sounds hollow, sir .
Will, you are human. I see you. I’m still here.
Why is he apologizing to us? He needs to be settling things man to man with Chris.
Seems so fake, I Will Never watch will smith Again!
Fogged out lol
sad i really liked will
I understand your apology. But the bigger question was where was the outraged with Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson???
Hollywood punishments are weird, in the real world, you go to court or jail for what occurred.
go away will,  please!!   Enough  of your rhetoric, sad but obviously you have a lot of learning still to do. Just get out of the Limelight none of us want to see your face or hear your voice anymore go enjoy yourself become a real person and grow. No disrespected
This will pass, all things do, and in the future, people will think more on the majority of your image rather than the minority of it. Move on and keep doing good in spite of your public perception, and over time, your good will shine more than your bad.
I’ve always found Will as a complex character that I respect and admire. This incident certainly has taken from this, but i will still stand by him as someone I admire, as all men have made mistakes, and although this one was severe and should not be overlooked. And for a man whose life is constantly under the gaze of millions, Will has incredible courage in trying to do better. It’s a lot easier to most of us when we still have the privacy and personal livelihoods that are stripped away from celebrities. That’s what is most important.
It’s rewind time
Trump has done worser than him 😅
fake af...
Everyone makes mistakes man....Will Smith was a iconic person for many of us growing up....I don't think less of him.
Sheesh… 😮 You absolutely cannot put your hands on people. I’m happy you’re remorseful. 😊
You will be alright sir.
👀 I’m refusing to watch anything will smith is in now. Once my hero. Now just some actor in the background
None of us are perfect. This man sinned and is asking for forgiveness. Who are we to keep our backs to a man  admitted to his mistakes. I will keep praying for kinder hearts to prevail. And I will pray that Chris will forgive Will.
It's all love Will and always will be bro. We move forward 🙏
Some of these comments disgust me but not one single person knows what it's like to be Will Smith
Here we go another apology video.
This isn't genuine,  grow up .
I believe him.  Who has never done something they didn't regret?
Why does he need a hat to apologize?
fake apology..only cause you have a movie coming out
Sucks to see a guy who seemed to have a great reputation and love for humanity act like a knuckle dragging ape, honestly just disappointed.
We’ve all felt the same urges, made choices and on occasion, took action when restraint was probably called for. Don’t allow 30 seconds of over publicised self-disappointment taint your legacy or your future, we all err, it’s a human failing, chin up Will.
fresh apologies of bel air
275k dislikes lol
He is definitely sorry we accept your apology will Im happy for your new movie
Just pray for direction Will. Sometimes we're holding on to a nightmare & don't even realize it.
This man talks like he's reading off of a que card
Chris, I apologize to you. BUT FIRST LET'S THANK OUR SPONSOR: NORD VPN-
No one is perfect no one hasn't made mistakes no one can say they are better.  But please make your apology sincere and not public.  Stop seeking attention on this matter
His handlers will read a handfull of comments and report back it was a success 🤣🤣
Woll smuth can only communicate to humans through film. Its all he knows, its all he has, bless him.
Hey you, ultra sencitive part of western society. Yeah, you. Those of you who try to shame Will. Why the f*** you think his feelings and aches is less important than yours or Chris's? Why your sencitive culture can hurt him and it's OK, but when he hurts you back - it's a criminal and you are trying to put him on his knees in front of you? You are sick guys.  Dear Will. Just know you have support of men and women who think there must be a responsibility for what you're saying or doing. For most of women you're almost a hero for what you did. And you have our respect.
Will Smith I forgive you!
Could you BE more egocentric?
❤️ ❤❤
Take the L bruh
I still love him
The apology to Chris seemed fake compared to the apology to his mother
Poor excuse of a role model
Will Smith is proof that celebrities can do whatever they want and people will act like it was nothing.
It was not only a Psychology Diploma we survived wars. Spacefortress 49. It is not fake, their Zombies they died somehow. Power Rangers got a Fortress also nearby, the StarShip Troopers.
Yes Playstation is Linked to Sega, by Law of Diploma your able to Sign in. Be Cautious. it is an Artificial intelligence.
And Gundam Wing.
Gundam Seed Destiny Update was not fake.
I built one on this side. I was in Combat. Gundam FreedomStrike.
I'AM Helping your family Ascend. Yeah I told you , and the two boys all that was required.
He is only an average Blue S.P.D. Ranger.
I became the Blue 00 Ranger.
He is the Blue S.P.D. Ranger this is a Private Talk.
When I was in Final Fantasy the guy became a power Ranger, his name was thought to be Daniel Hernandez known as Jim Carey. He tried to use a Laptop to Connect to a Gundam. Daniel is actually Jim Carey status Missing.
The fact that you claim to not be ashamed of yourself, means that you still have your ego intact which was responsible for your actions in the first place. And no apology coming from a position of Ego is genuine. Its just hogwash.
Will you made one of the greatest apology video ever
If being fake had a face this would be it. The fact that he knew the consequences of his actions and did it anyway implies that he was under the assumption that he could get away with it and his assumption of power.
Lies
PRAY
Did he divorce her
UNDERSTANDING THE nuances OF IT'S CONVERSATION,MY MAN IS LEGEND
You people talking smack about Will better watch out..he might smack the crap out of you 🥺
this videos dislike was a trend... your fans want you to embrace your humanity and make the next project show us a side of you no one thought capable... we will never forget, but we will always be here.. show us what you got  BIG WILL!!!! 😎🤕🤨🤨😎
Feel sorry for this guy
Everyone keeps bashing will smith for this video. Think about this guys..   Would he apologize if he thought he didnt do anything wrong?   He has done so much good in his life. Then this one singular bad thing. He gets this much hate. Try to consider he is at least trying to mend things.
It's all jedda
All you perfect no mistake making mfs passing judgment on another man decision. A man that y’all have supported and learned from etc.. If you support him, support him then don’t jump on the bandwagon when the agenda switch. So it really a wake up call to Will about how FAKE his fans are. On how quick mfs turn on you💯
Improve !
Do you think he would do this video if everyone was on his side?
So fake and over dramatic.
nobody will forget bro, this apology is so fake they should have escort you out of the event.
This is what aunt Viv had to put up with lol
Will Smith is the future president of the United States!
Hold on Will, man. Many people make mistakes, but only real men have the courage to admit them. Respect from Moscow. PEACE ✌️
I just cannot get over the "Just Water" plug whilst apologizing.... me me me me me!
Made a canny bit money from this video…
Hope you doing well
Nothing but a grub
This Dude is not sorry Just another person who became big and let his ego get big too
Will Smith, I just want to say to you, that it seems you have done nearly 8,000 beautiful, wonderful things in the industry. And then 1 bad. And you get remembered for that 1bad. I am here for you, even though I was shocked, but, someone should not have to be remembered for the bad thing they had done. Blessings and peace be upon you 🙏
Peace to you man
Will Smith is still a legend! It takes a bigger person to apologise and admit they’ve mad a mistake! Love makes us do strange things in the heat of the moment! #respect ❤
You should feel ashamed, but you clearly don't.
❤️
Thanks for giving me new nickname ideas for my friends.
Tbh u are the best actor but I am 13 yrs old but I feel u things happen but it'll get better trust
Will Smith, no matter what you have apologized. you are still my favorite actor.
I forgive him, Yall hating on Will Smith but a heat of the monemt decision but yall can forgive people like Logan Pual who palyed with Dead Bodies and Ezra Miller who committed multiple felonies. Ya'll are pathetic.  Will I don't agree with what you did but mistakes happen, I will still support you and I hope you can get through this.
You don't need to apologize for nothing! If more men defended their wives, things would be alot better 😉 Its says alot about your character that you made this video. 👍👋👍 Have an Amazing Day Will 🤩🤩🤩
これをきっかけで人を傷つける面白くないジョークを言わなくなればいい 彼は被害者
This is the problem with money... too little is not good and too much is even worse.
Bunch of over paid babies
Glad to see you back. I hope time heals all the wounds for everyone involved.
You had a better performance in shark tale than this half assed apology
We all make Mistakes.
Love you will.. on god🙌🏽🙌🏽
274k dislikes. Damnnn
he sounds like a literal robot trying to learn human mannerisms & emotions, struggling to combine words to make a informative sentence lmao
No one has the right to accuse Smith of lying. He did a lot of good things, and then he made one mistake, and everyone hated him for it and forgot about all his merits and that he is actually a good person.
273,844 dislikes as of 10-17-2022
Of course it's genuine he made a mistake like we all do he knows he has done wrong. sometime as humans we do things without thinking we just act.... that's part of being human our emotions take over but we have too take the lesson from those actions and do better. that's truly growing as a person
No mercy for bully..Will is a bully May be his movie is coming up- "Entanglements"
5:07 thats the right mindset to have, that one action does not define you obviously. it all works out at the end. ill always be supporting you Will, you never disappointed me
i understand Will smith , the mind can get foggy and we can act in ways we dont really mean to.
Its been more than a minute. Its been 6 months
where is the dog
You have a long way to go.
🇳🇦❤️✨
How many dislikes now?
❤❤❤❤❤
Will Smith trying to salvage his career and reputation....
How many times did he say umm
스미스형 힘내!!
I'm really surprised the comments are not disabled for this video.
A Humble Man👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣👣
Everyone deserves a second chance, especially you.
bro dis is the most fake apology video ive seen like bruhhhh if u really cared y didnt u apologise in the award moment and ur an actor its real easy for u t ojust: im sorry theres no part of me that thinks it was a right thing to do. THEN WHY DID U DO IT SMH
This guy is a legend. He's done many great things. He makes one mistake and y'all are hating on him
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
Will smith you were an icon to me I loved you to death I loved all your movies and the memories I made watching them I love how you were in men in black 11 the most it really hurts my heart that you destroyed your career like this I really hope you get better soon
Will my man I love you. Don't worry you are forgiven. It's not easy but you have to move forward. God bless you
Current amount of dislikes on 10/12/2022 is 273,000.
fun fact: this has 273k dislikes as if right now
Uncle Phil never did anything like that... maybe that's why he's a better role model... you should be ashamed... if you were a dog they'd put you down
Will smith made a huge mistake and he can’t do anything about it, there is no good solution to this, Chris already hates him
It's really doesn't seem apologetic. I think he should be banned forever.
This is a man with a IQ that starts with 7 and is absolutely no more than two digits
Hey what the heck is going on wheres Hancock 2 at anything even a teas or clip or something just think about it
Kawawa naman ang taong ito. Wala na, sira ka na boy
Stay strong brother, we all falter. Come back better.
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
You are human Will. People have to understand that the tv/movie you are only apart of you. Not the whole you, always having fun. I admit I got caught up in the movie/tv you also. Mistake I made. I forgive you brother. Who am I to judge!
I wish I never see smiths on a any Screen anywhere
Deep
We are all human. We make mistakes and we grow. Continue your spiritual journey❤️🙏🏿
What Denzel said to you was totally pointless and made absolutely no sense given the situation then he sits there looking all wise whilst you thank him for it during your speech……CRIIIIIINGE 😂🤣👌🏾
Like whatever, man. It's not that big a deal. Happens in pubs every night. You just happened to be on TV.
It's been a minute and let it last for years...
And DON'T be full of SHAME!!!! EVER!!
Still a fan. Will, you may (should?) have to take the first step. If Chris (an awesome performer) isn't ready, so be it. But, I'm thinking, (my opinion) Chris will accept it. As for the friendship, that will have to be built again, you may find a stronger version of that waiting. Or it may just be your apology is accepted, and never another word spoken between the two of you. Trust. Yourself.  Stop wasting time, ain't no changing any of what was done. Let's move on. Life. Is. Way. Too. Short. We are all guilty of making a phucked up choice. Let it go, that mess is toxic. Forgiveness. That's a powerful gift. I'm not letting one moment define my opinion.
I use to look up to u my whole life but now u let that woman change you sad
For those who didnt know, This video has around 270k+ dislikes compared to the 100k likes,  shows how much people hate him now
Great step forward 👏 👍 your human!! Own it be!! One love!!
Will, I can believe or I can’t. The apology comes long way too. I only hope you take good care of your mental health
I don't support what will did what so ever. But I cant help feel bad for the guy.
Unsubscribe
great actor, this is good acting
Apologizing after 5 months 😂😂😂 Bcz his movie is comming up 😂😂😂
He sounds like he's making everything up as he says it.
Weak people revenge  strong people forgive  intelligent people ignore                         - Albert Einstein
So Jada's a chick?
Yo, Will. I'm a big fan and like everyone else, I heard about the incident. However, I just wanted to say a lot of people may have given up on you,  but I haven't and I hope you and Chris will be friends again.
where is the dislike button?
We all make mistakes. Problem is, it wasn't a mistake. Will Smith's knew exactly what he was doing that night and he certainly showed no remorse at the time - It was only after seeing the backlash and realising it may destroy his career, that he decided to apologise (Oh and that was a half arsed PR driven twitter apology, it took him another 2 months to actually do it properly) Will showed his true colours that night, I'm done with him.
We still love you will ❤
The accident shocked us all in South Africa... While i was watching TV My mom's be like>> 😳😬😵🤐.  What the hell just happened.
Go to hell Will your not sorry.
I like to believe he is sincere. We all make mistakes, even big ones
He did this because his new movie coming out. PUBLICITY STUNT! Go F yourself WIlly
Still a Jerkoff!!!
Lost all respect for will Smith
Some of his best acting right here. Does anyone still buy these pathetic, staged Youtube apologies anymore? Multiple cameras, editing, the obvious script, the walk, sit down and sigh. Jesus Christ it's embarrassing.
solid acting... even how he reads the question like its his first time reading the questions! like  he hasn't meticulously practiced those lines for the past month , like a big motion picture role..
Lowlife
He's all 🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
Its all jadas fault
not stopping being your friend because of one mistake. Much love ♥
Head high God’s got you will
Weak!
You know we love you Will! Happy to see you back online. Know that your true fans are here to support you and help you get through  this. Stay strong!
Nahh this not it bro lol 😂
at 2:50, he was laughing ! he can't help it ! OMG!!! what a hypocrite.
SOMETIMES WE WISH WE COULD DOTHINGS OVER MR. SMITH , BUT IM  SURE YOU ARE A WAY BETTER PERSON FOR ITYOU ARE A VERY SPECIAL PERSON  LIVING A  VERY SPECIAL LIFE  THANK YOU YOU FOR BEING WILL SMITH, I A PRECIATE  YOU  KEEP  WINNING KEEP LOSOSING KEEP BEING HUMAN BRO
What’s the name of the shoes he’s wearing?
Will don't deserve this
Thing that sux about this is Will has made a ton of money off this staged apology video... I'm still super upset about this Will, Giving every cent of your money away and start again is the only way I would ever respect you ever again. The money tainted you and your family, the veil slipped for a moment and showed the tainted rich man... Money giveth and money taketh...
You're not sorry.
The memes that came from this incident were worth the pain you are going through. Get my wife’s name outta yo mouth!!
Now this is Will Smith on screen, not the real one we saw that night.
❤
Apologies accepted will.

This seems like he's acting. Dude she ain't worth it!
For being an actor, he really didn’t study this script very well. :/
UPLOAD AGAIN
Amazing how efficiently Will ended his own career.
Lexi r beat u in subs
Enough of this crap, DELETE YOUR CHANNEL.
I’ve always supported you for years, and I still do. I’m very happy that you stepped up and told everyone you’re not a perfect person. Thank you for your apology. I forgive you.
don't worry mr smith we all make mistakes even i made mistakes that i can't take back
I've got so much love for Chris , may God continue to bless him in every way.
HEY WILL IF ALL HATE YOU I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU .
Lexi reviera won lol
The part where will says, "It's Cvckold'in time" in this so called "apology" vid, was so stunning, so brave! I was in tears...
you a legend my guy ! no matter what these other overly sensitive americans have to say ... it litteraly has NOTHING to do with their life yet they try to be invested in it like it is ....
Lexington Rivera won the race

You just that kind of person... I think you don't need to aplogize like... for us to look at lol
6 months ago and your apology now??
Everyone is saying this video is fake but I could tell it came from his heart and he truly is sorry for what happened everyone is human and we all make mistakes and in the moment you don’t always think about what you’re doing before you do it everyone makes mistakes everyone messes up sometimes everyone does things they didn’t wanna do that they wish they could take back we all need to have sympathy for each other and realize that we are all our own person and we are all gonna mess up sometimes and we can’t take that back we can’t just turn back time and I feel as though we should all forgive him because that’s what God would want and as long as he asks for forgiveness he will be forgiven maybe not by everyone but for sure by God and hopefully one day him and Chris will make up.
Gente pq ninguém tá culpando o Chris ele fez uma piada com uma doença e sem nem falar com a pessoa que ele ia fazer a piada de algo tão sério e íntimo…. Pq ninguém tá falando disso???????? Pra mim o Will sempre vai ser o melhor ator e pra mim estão cometendo um erro com e ele pq ele não merecia e não merece isso que está passando…… FOI O CHRIS QUE ERROU
Come back Will. It’s okay.
Apologise and Sorry are two different meaning.
We forgive you Will! everyone who doesn’t forgive you is just a hater, #SmithNationforlyfe
I hope we will not see you any more
❤
F this guy.. waits a few months and then say I'm sorry, you're sorry because you lost money during the time and that's the only reason.
Shrug it off bro
Hey am i late
Put your sorrys in a sack you did Chris dirty!!!
He just has to admit he simped
Lol
Cmmon should the "WATER" bottle on the table be a promo? A promo in an apology-video? smh
All this bad coments towards will but remember can you truly throw a stone at him have you never sined never made a mistake never was in bad palce or mental state and it takes a lot to come to the whole world like this to apologize man the media from the start kept saying he lost this and that before he acctualy lost carree family etc so in the end it became true from thestart they just tortured him but if you was in a fucked up  situation i know i would pray to god just give me break like everyone else so to anyone who is hjman and understand pain take it easy and to will just keep goin life goes on hope you get better and you get that break bro
Babe you are a Human.  Its is not Your Desire Nor Intention to EVER Hurt or Let them down. You are Divinely Loved, Forgiven and Embraced ❤️🙌🏼❤️
Sweetheart Forgive Yourself.
Honey u r Human at this point.  You are DIVINE LOVE. YOUARE WORTH EVERYTHING INCLUDING FORGIVENESS!!!
Cuz you were under her Spell Baby.
I love U Will! 🫶🏽✨  You’re a great person, and above all, human.
Я перепрошую, що не англійською пишу. Уіле, я є великою шанувальницею вашої творчості і вважаю, що Ви вірно вчинили, захистивши честь своєї дружини. Кріс Рок не правий. Не вміє жартувати, то й не варто таких запрошувати на велику сцену. ❤️🌷
Please stop judging. Let It Go Allow Will to recover. Everyone that has  commented on Will's channel has made a mistake.  No one is perfect.  Will keep your head up no matter.
THIS. Is. Integrity.  Rooting for your deserved peace, Mr. Smith.
I’ve always known that you are phony. I enjoyed all your work but you couldn’t fool me.

Admit you are a sinner in need of a saviour. Admit your sins and ask Jesus Christ for forgivness. For the sins that you know of and  the sins that you don't. John 1 9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. Believe that Jesus died died on the cross and rose again after 3 days as a payment for your sins. John 3 16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Confess that Jesus is Lord. Commit yourself to a life of following Jesus Christ. Romans 10 9 - If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10 13 - Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

Happy Birthday 🙂 Blessings Will S.
Why does an apology need professional lighting and a multicam studio setup lol
Narcissist
I "Will" Always Love You Man!!!!
Man will is one of my favorite actors. I dont understand why everyone acts like they never snapped and made a mistake before. Its human nature. He still shouldnt be dealing with the silly reproduction
You have a lesson to learn from Hancock, if he could prove people wrong then you also can💪
Ich sorge dafür das es euch danach noch gibt und ein Beispiel für moderne Religion seid. Ich helfe dem BND hier Klarheit zu schaffen.
Wir müssen Kinder schützen. Ich hab Mal wieder einen Wutanfall gehabt. Der Boxer in mir.
Jetzt läuft dieses Unendlichkeit Ding überall
Lexi Rivera is besting u by 2k she might get 10MIL before u do
You folded
I respect you will for apologizing to Chris but like you said it will take some time
Happy Birthday, Will!!! 🎊🎈🎂🎁🍾
How about you apologize to yourself and to us the audience?
I lost all respect for you Will. Goodbye.
Will NO PERSON is perfect. We All fall short, I am 🙌 for Healing for everyone.  Sending my ⚖️ 💜 and Light. 🙏
Will Smith, I trust that you are sincere in your apology after listening to your interview with David Letterman. Something clearly got triggered in you to be able to do what you did. It's a drag that people have been so extremely critical, but you will survive this, sir. Know that their reactions are a reflection of their own inner pain and struggles, and it's so much easier to point the finger and blame than to look within.   If one is truly awakened, one doesn't need to judge another. We are all on this journey of life together, all make mistakes, all seek forgiveness for things we've done... all returning to the spirit of love, compassion, kindness, creativity, and our true divinity, in whatever way we define that...  we humans are all works in progress! I know that you know this.! Keep searching your heart and return to that state of love for yourself and others that heals all wounds (even if it takes the others longer). May you be blessed with love and light!
I appreciate the video. I don't like that you had to do this video.  I never put you up on a pedestal. But as a former husband I can identify with you.  Still my homie, still make me laugh and get involved with most of your movies. You are only human bro. Happy Birthday Big Will
Is your career OK
Happy birthday will! 🥳🥳🤩🤩
Will mistakes happen and true fans support and understand we still here for you
#lexirevira win
Lexi is winning the comp
I know a lot of people can’t tell if he’s actually apologizing but there is a quote that goes something like, “everyone is innocent until proven guilty” so if we don’t know then why do we need to assume the worst? I mean give him a chance, if this were you, you would probably want to have a second chance and have people believe you, I mean there isn’t much else he could do so give him a break, please. God would forgive you and I think we should all forgive him, I mean if you don’t want to you don’t have to but there’s no need to write rude comments about it, there really isn’t much else he could do about this situation but to just apologize and he did so I don’t know what else you want from him.
LEXI IS GOING TO WIN WILL YOUR'E GOING DOWN
Will. Nobody cares.
Happy birthday 🎉🎉
Just saying! Antidote to the coronavirus since November 2021: OGYI13376
Happy birthday Sir 🧡big fan we same same bdays 😘
The end of will Smith. This video is a car crash. It's a full disaster.
He is only human. You should only look up to God.
This is not as bad as his acceptance speech - but close.
What a fall. Oh damn.
You got a get out of jail free card. I get it, things are different and it's hard to embrace a new journey. You're so busy trying to please your 2 faced fans who by the way would love to be in your shoes right now, that you forget you're already standing in your own shoes. You're will smith baby and you got will smith money. Now stop your whining and go spend some will smith money and enjoy what's left of a limited experience we call life. Your fans don't hate you, you just gave your haters a louder voice! You said it best, just remember what's on the other side of fear and go jump out of that airplane. Peace and love, thank you for being you, now go do you.
Sorry but I heard the short I'm going for lexie...
Will smith, I forgive you because I already know that you are the best
Just go to the guy and apologize, not from us, you only proved that you care about your fam & your business.
Hello Will Smith! Lexi Rivera is beating you my man...Come on! Do something to get more subscribers, you can do it! Still support you by the way, we are not gonna forget your talent because of a mistake. Of course ,it was a big mistake. But we won’t forget you 👍🏽
I feel really really sad and sorry for this entire event.  2 of the most prominent men of color; nearly same in age and both HUGELY talented!!  They are ROLE MODELS for millions of young men of ALL COLORS.  I want them to make up and go on a tour together to SHOW that people make mistakes and people get over them.... I come from a huge family... these fights can go on for years and years and are tragic
Why he sound like Hancock before and after jail
A tiger never loose its stripes.. so better just shut up
Hey will idk if u read these dude but hopefully u read this one. Hollywood is only a part of ure lifeman. U are wonderful u have done nothing but good in this world big dawg. Ure not a pos and dont allow trolls and ppl that have probably hated on u and ppl in Hollywood tear u down. Your awesome and have brought nothing but motivational times and happy times in my life. Being a star is forever no matter what and u walked tht path. Be humble be grateful and dont allow others to prevent you from moving forward to do more in this world as u no doubt will!dont allow even ure loved ones to tell u otherwise dude its not worth it. U apologized now u move on let those tht wont be trapped in there own misery. Thk u for everything u have done and the impact u have made on me in my 32 yrs keep on keeping on ure amazing bro i mean tht. Also listen to ure own motivational vidoes sometimes and remember as u said u are only human and mistakes are apart of all of our lives and mold us and push us in directions tht only ppl like u and i can overcome and learn from so wherever it is ure headed im sure itll be great. Much respect to u!
He should've just apologize face to face instead of doing in front of millions of people thinking that he had that right.
Нема тобі за що вибачатися. Так повинен захищати свою сім'ю Кожен справжній чоловік. Ти прекрасний актор, мужній і мудрий чоловік.
OwO
Hey Will, we share the same birthday man.  Turning 30 on Sunday.  I’ll keep it short.  I love you and really still look up to you.  Hope you have a good one with loved ones and close friends.  Hope to meet you one day
Never forget what you done
Man, this guy doesn't deserve all this & at the same time maybe he does... That's bad tho, this is too staged my man, i think you need to get out of the family bubble & especially the couple bubble that is fogging you, relationship with miss Pinkett is... imma stop there cause i dont know enough but ... uuh manipulation looks real. Love you so much Will but i think there is a deeper look into self that needs to be done & maybe a total renewal on some ends. Despites everything, we can't forget that you're a worldwide treasure & exposure to everything when you're at your level of fame must be excruciating. I feel for you, we love you, just take time for yourself & make some needed choices in your life, you look like you need a step away from a lots of things, much love <3
Will Smith is it true you are racing Lexi Rivera to 10.M subs?
من طرف savage
Sucks he didn't say it's rewind time at the beginning
God bless you! We are humans and we make mistakes.. to me you are still the hero I grew up with love you man.
He should hv started his apology by saying that though his mistake is unpardonable but whatever has happened has happened and he can't do anything about it now, except asking for  for forgiveness for this mistake.
Just because you are a public figure does not mean you have to be perfect! Have more respect for you now, because you can acknowledge your wrongs and apologise. It is time for people to get over themselves. Sometimes people fight, but it does not mean everybody has to be a part of it!  Will Smith you are loved, and I hope I still get to see you work! You will always be my idol, because of your ability to inspire, your perfection of your craft, your consistent choice of portraying non stereotypical black male leads. I will always be appreciative of being able to grow up watching strong black male characters that looked like me on the big screen.
We miss you older brother, I hope you are doing well, and keep being an inspiration. You no ordinary actor, you are a genuine person and ethics model! Thank you for everything you dictated your life for...

Where is jada's apology?
Why does everybody hate chris?...... Well, maybe he said something he should not have.
C'est "une blague" que l'on peut sortir entre amis, en toute intimité....certainement pas au milieu d'une salle comble de gens narcissique qui sont précisément là pour vous scruter, vous pointez du doigt et vous juger.  Chris a fait une grossière erreur de 👎, plus qu'une innocente maladresse.
Lol
❤️
Is just creazy that because you are an actor and famous you have to do this stupid video saying sorry to people that you don't even know, and all that because of a mistake that you made. If everyone was perfect they wouldn't be any war or bad people in this world, the internet is the next war for the human race and Will Smith happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
weirdest sounding apology
Apology Accepted.
you could learn a thing or two from Brenden Fraser and Keanu Reeves on how to be a genuine, kind, humble, down to earth celebrity.
The whole Smith family are weird af.
We love you Will Smith ❤️
I love you Will since the fresh prince and forever will I be your friend. F.. any judgement. They don't live your life. I love you
Well done dude.
Forgot to unsubscribe to this channel 🙉
bla bla bla bla bla....  just words. BUT ACTION SPEAKS LOUTHER THAN WORDS
love u will
I really appreciate the apology that Will gave. It's not easy to give an apology, especially to the whole world. I do hope he is getting therapy, because he talks about having trauma.
❤
I'm glad that the internet can tell this is fake and completely insincere. At least this video will get Will Smith millions of views and probably a juicy paycheck
GARBAGE
Your sorry because of your outcome of this alone.!
GYFHOMS!!!Y!!!
will smith is just a regular black guy that was selected by the people in power to become famous to help the black community like now they choose khaby lame
idk why will is even apologizing tbh💀
Now he's fudged his movie career up wonder what he's goin do next no1 gonna watch any film he does from this point an it's all jadas fault mentally fudging him up ...
Oh dear. That was some waffley poop. The man can talk so eloquently at times, this sounds bizarre.
CLM 🍋 ✊
5:06 as hard as it sounds. Maybe you are.
The best fake apology ever filmed
Will Smith te pido de favor que no destruyan las cuevas de los tallos en ECUADOR, te pido respeto por las cuevas de los tallos es un lugar sagrado para todo el mundo.
Beautiful apology. That was courageous and honest. So happy you addressed it.
I think Will going off would been ok, I think him going off for that is what people mostly like wtf
Count how many times he said moment, and, ughhh
This is not how you apologize.
You crossed the line in the worst way. There is no comeback now.
fortunate is he who remembers allah abundantly....
You will never be a good human being married to that woman.
The LORD is near to those who have a broken heart, And saves such as have a contrite spirit.
It's ok Will, we all make mistakes, your mom made 2.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE SOME GOOD MEMORIES BEFORE HE SHE THEY THEM US ME OR YOU GO OFF INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.
It’s sad there is such cynicism in these comments. Who cares if the apology looks slick. The words are what counts. He’s not “acting”…anyone can hear the words that he uses that he is expressing his own thoughts and feelings. I mean, what do people want? Tears? Blubbering? He’s a mature adult with excellent public speaking experience; what do you expect from the guy?
Remember what you said in the commercial for the Prince of Bel-Air.
Los comentarios me parecen un asco, les puedo asegurar que en esa situación la gran mayoría que lo tachan de mentiroso, falso y se burlan de su mensaje solo porque es millonario reaccionarían peor que Will, parece que no tienen una vida porque de tenerla se darían cuenta que hay momentos en los que uno no reacciona a lo que hace, los peores de aca son ustedes dan verguenza..
Doesn't seem like he means a word of what he says. Would think he could at least show some emotion if he regrets it.
Drowning in falseness
He cried when he got the award for best actor…..but this? Ahhhhhhh  well…..
This crap truly means nothing.
What is wrong with y’all? This man only owes Chris an apology, so questioning his sincerity is honestly not y’all’s place. Most of y’all ain’t never held your self accountable, so sit back and shut up please.
You dont need to do this, sorry but Chris was rude mexicanos are with you, what he did was bullying
Will, how many boys have you fucked, be honest ?
His actions disappointed me because he’s one of my favorite actors. But I am a believer in forgiveness and understanding that humans make mistakes. Those of us who have never sinned should throw the first stone right? It’s not our job to judge or to condemn. He made a mistake, I forgive him as a fan. I can only hope he will go and make better decisions. Control his feelings better. Life’s too short to hold grudges, let’s let more love lead us forward through this. ❤
no One Cares bro...sorry.
Awful apology tbh
you used to be cool man!
PERSONALLY I THINK CHRIS SHOULD SHOW HE HAS NO PRIDE BY REACTING AND ENDING THIS. I HATE HIS REACTION🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🏖️🤬
don't smack a brother in a room full of rich white people  you are meme now. Don't choose your path based on the sins you carry. Carry your sins on the path you tread.
I have a friend who was diagnosed with clinical narcissism. This is EXACTLY how he apologizes when he fuxks up. It's eerie.
It's sad to look how Will Smith endend
Still waiting for this video to go private juuuust like the frosk rant on g4tv.
This dude hasn't come out with a good movie since Seven Pounds in 2008. The acting in this "Apology" video shows that.
He who is without sin cast the first stone.
Remember don't harrass people if they accept it or not
you can tell this isn’t really what he thinks this is what he thinks sounds best and what should be publicly said.
if anyone wanna know, this videos has 267k dislikes
At least Will listened to Willow
Bro i liget just seach this name up 💀💀💀 wtf
😂😂😂😂😂 he's not getting it at all!
I am so sorry. My heart bleeds for you and your family. Stand strong.
Hard to build, easy to destroy.  Career.
Hahahahah
Feeling sorry for Will due to his career nose dive. If he needs a bit of cash, my front lawn needs a mow. 👍
You not are P 💩,  you’re Amazing talent human, 🙌🏻❤️‍🔥 keep going bro.  Jesus love you every one ☝🏻 no matters what happened. Take your lesion and keep going ❤️‍🩹
Nice drama Will, I need 2nd season for this. 😭
Fair enough for now.  I get what you're saying, Will.  You are no more defined by the unskillful actions than the skillfully ones.  You're not gold, nor are you a POS. It's hard to be human these days, as trauma us ubiquitous, but many have less of a load, and will not understand.   It's not easy to heal from our childhoods, and it will require a willingness to accept mistakes.  As you know, it doesn't excuse the behavior, but it is explanative if one wishes to understand.  Glad that in your case here, nobody was seriously injured, and that you will be working towards guilt for an action vs. shame for who you are. You're not alone in this difficult process, but for those that do not understand, you will be judged and labeled.  Not fair, but telling as to this culture's tolerance for mistakes, and our failure to understand that growth and change come require mistakes. Perfection expected from others is a sign of perfection expected from self, so that judgments are an expression of the judging, not the judge. Wishing you well during this difficult time.
I love You,Will Smith,from Venezuela.
We got your back brotha.
Whenever you’re ready. You set the sails and choose the direction for yourself. Don’t let anything keep you down.
My respect for you went down soon as you committed the act. You should apologize not only to Chris but also to your fans for the arrogant behavior of yours. Such a disrespect.
Can never tell when actors aren't acting. unless it amber heard AKA Amber brown stains
I am pretty certain he doesn't feel sorry, and I personally believe that's because it was all a publicity stunt and pulling attention from the hot topics at the time...just my uneducated feeling...
The real slim Shady song was supposed to be released today
just like you beat that innocent man blind
Its rewind time
While Will Smith was 100% wrong for what he did, to him it was genuinely in the name of his wife....I can at least respect that part!  With Jimmie Kimmel, at the Emmys, it too was in bad taste but in the name of Jimmie Kimmel, about Kimmel, for Kimmel...self centered, self righteous host with 0 optics on how it looked.   My respect for Will Smith is far more than Kimmel
Hi Will. I never did like your show, movies, or "comedy". I've always thought it was crap at best.  Glad you wont be making any more movies in the near future. Hope you'll never appear in one long term.
KEEP MY WIFE'S NAME OUT YA FUCKIN MOUTH
Lol everybody got mad at will for getting really mad but yet everyone in this world has had a meltdown
I feel bad for Will but at the same time it was such a unnecessary move and all for a woman who doesn't even love him
love all the billy bobs in the comment section sitting on their couches eating Doritos, zero money in the bank, 50 pounds over weight, working shitty jobs and never really worked hard at anything in their lives before, coming on here to "scold" will smith and call his apology fake. because you know... Billy bobs life is so hard when he orders pizza with extra pepperoni and the server forgets. Billy over here has never made a mistake before or did anything he regretted.  So obviously, Wills apology must be fake. 🙄
You didn't let people down you just showed what you really are you took 3 months to write this script but not even 3 second in the event.  🤬#BoycottWillSmith is what you deserve Chris showed his class and you showed yours on that stage.
Didn't even know this existed, came here from smii7y's last video
bruh
Cap apology
I still love you man. This speech took home for me and I forgive you for making a stupid mistake that Dawn on me for my image of you. I always look up to you and as a kid I ether wanted to be you or wanted you as my dad. Take care my man. Make some movies so I can enjoy myself more.
1:52 nothing is irreparable on these issues !
Hello, my name is Mr.Frog; hello.
I still look up to you! Being real is part of life... You can learn and grow from your mistake and I can also learn from what happend that day... Personally I don't think it was socially right but I do feel it was an expected natural REACTION... I hope i can still see you on the big screan because I am waiting for your next movie.... probably not gonna see the comment but i left it here anyways! with love from Mexico!
1:58 I spent the last three months, replaying and thinking of the script for the perfect apology video with 5 cameras in 120fps4K
L
Woke will 🤮
Bruv we know it was all staged from that one movie all this is fake and wrong and you are trying to distract the ppl from bigger issues in the world your only a piece in a chess game..
It seems staged
Look at everyone acting like their holier than thou  You lot are snakes, acting like you never lost your temper, or acted insecure before.  No, you did, thats why you hate will because he reminds you of that part of yourself.
Will: " I promise we can be friends, again. Chris: " Yeah, after you give me $200 million dollars"
Even when he’s a class actor it’s hard for me to believe that his apology is genuine and sincere. 🤷🏽‍♂️
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF!!
Look mate, stop being such a tragedy. You have the world at your fingertips. Cheer up for all our sakes.
Shout out to jada’s boyfriends behind the camera
I didn't even watched the lame "apology" 😂 I just came to read the comments bashing him and his family.
You know what time it is? Its rewind time! Hahaho! That's hot! That's hot!
1/5th million dislikes.
Faker than a $3 bill
Ya no te disculpes Will, eres un ser humano ejemplar, un excelente actor, siempre humilde yo te admiro y siento un gran cariño por ti, quisiera darte un gran abrazo y decirte que has hecho un gran trabajo con tu vida. Recuerda que la luz de tu alma es tan brillante que nada podrá apagarla. Que Dios esté en tu camino siempre 🙏
Nope!
Will just come back and do your thing! We miss you 🥰
He’s just worried about his career.
Everyone deserves a second chance, they who haven't committed mistakes, please cast the first stone 🪨. Forgiveness is a change that happens from inside of you that frees you from the past. Thank you for recognizing your faults and pushing forward
so when are u apologizing to chris?
You’re are a fenomenal human been Will. Don’t fallow victims of some crowd who had a bad day. Think of how much good ,laughter and inspiration have you brought to this world. Thinks are just the way they are, we’re all slaves of our subconscious mind that play tricks on us. We all have an ego to protect its part of being human. Don’t take it  to seriously. The ones who don’t take you with your flaws send them a scale if they don’t know how to weight you input into this world with all you numerous flaws they don’t deserve an explanation or who you are. Much love to you and your family. You’re fu*king great with all your struggles. Never forget that and stay on your mind.
아내를 때린 조니뎁은 감싸지만, 아내를 조롱한 남자를 때린 윌스미스는 용서하지 못하는 이상한 광경...
I feel you did want any guy should of done. Man your still a hero to me from fresh prince to after earth to orbit you inspired me and still do man stay strong! Respect the vid I watched your stuff everytime been a min glad to hear from you!
El de las recargas Ö
Not impressed. He needs to stop trying to justify his actions, stop taking to social media with this BS (all roads point to these questions being staged), and keep all apologies between his and Chris’ camp. Point blank, Will: Yes, you are a human that messed up big time. But, when we humans make choices similar to yours, we suffer the consequences. Just be grateful that, unlike the average human being who assaults someone for saying something we didn’t like, you are not facing criminal charges or sitting behind bars.
Who the hell thought it was a good idea to put product placement in this video?!
It was a mistake Will, we all make ones.  And I think the way you are showing up now it's honorable and admirable. You are being so courageous and self-aware ❤ Also, thank you for showing us what is like to be human. THANK YOU
Damn will Orlando Brown bust you out I thought you was just about that weird
I feel sad to read the comments here. All that hate and mocking him for being a human.
Its good TV man
Love from IND 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳😊
Product placement? Really?
This is actually a really good video. 3 good questions and a very thorough and genuine answer for each question. Leave the man alone and let him enjoy his life. Come on people. You all loved Will Smith at one point or saw his movies anyway
youtube literally removed the dislike button and it still has 266K dislikes💀
Weirdo
Danger....
For the record, I lost all respect for you after the incident but I admire your channel's bravery in keeping the comments on. Apple can learn from you.
This video reminds me of the time Logan Paul made a video apologizing for his incident in Japan.
I’ll miss you wish I remembered u though but hey I left you pizza
You know how long it took you to recognize you needed to apologize? You were posting like nothing happened.  you realized no one was letting it go. If you didn't wanna let your fans down, do better, especially when it comes down to owning up to it. Richy rich over here, telling me he's telling himself he's a good person
Anyways... we do see that strategic product placement.
Wish they stilled showed the dislike count
The sincerity is overwhelming 🤣
Man... It's really okay. Let's just all breathe and go onto doing great things, as much as we can.
I wish you never did that.
It's OK will. We all make mistakes and we are all only human. I love you man xxx
I remember his quote “when you’re comfortabel you are not growing”..  I guess he grew a lot the last year..
Will smith is still a great man and great actor we all f up let him thrive and come back to his fans stronger and more resilient. Will I respect you Sir. 👊🏽💜
Love u Angel  Keep loving yourself, God, everyone and everything within and around you 🫶🏻🫶🏻💜💜
apology not accepted 👎🏼
This gives off homelander vibes from the boy's. Nice managed crisis video to make everything allllll better.
he needs to work on his sincerity acting.
Will "THE FRESH PUPPET" Smith
Will Smith you are a good man, we all know it was not intentional but was out of emotions. Hope Chris and everyone accept this apology and forgive you  ❤️❤️❤️
You used to be better at acting bro
😒 More and more disappointing, you are pathetic...
Only when he's the one affected by his actions, he wants to apologize and fix things, this what we call a hypocrite. A big SNAKE, his hole life
BEETTTTYYAAA
R.I.P Queen Elizabeth, My Condolences go out to Charles III and his family.
it not that bad bro,I'm a conservative,and feel I'm not the one to give you advice,but bro let it go,start posting on ur YouTube channel again.look at Alec Baldwin,now that's bad.Move on my friend.
Hey Will, how's your SUMMER been? ..... Something something something.... Your wife's name. 😂
Much respect ✊
This is real.
As you are an actor, releasing a recorded apology through YouTube seems a bit “staged”. You are a public figure, and this may have been the only move you had left on the table.  I think though that you are genuinely apologetic for your actions. A famous man made a mistake. I’m sure the publics reaction was punishment enough. Hug your loved ones Will, and keep your heart close to home. Forget about what every one else thinks. Forget about your image for the time being. Love your sons, love your daughters. Just be present. It’ll all work itself out in time. Work on you. In the end that’s all that matters.
LOL BYE
Will it's okay. Just stop apologizing I know you trying to be kumbaya, but it's done. Tried he is over it. We can't  always become  cool again.  It is what it is he is not really that  much of an integral part of your life  Said sorry it just stands as not one of your best moments. We can't  all be perfect Will.  Just know people  care for you  with your flaws.  All in all really Will you are a cool cat  This won't  make you I promise you.  You just have to forgive  you.
#Save_Shwetabh_Gangwar
this is bizarre.
Is anyone really this detached from reality?  An appology isn't about yourself.  Acknowledge your actions and their impact.  Leave out any victimization or suffering you incurred because it's not about you.  This is the part you have to have to accept because you "live with the consequences."  You feel bad?  Good.
Lol
Wow… I’m just now seeing this. First off, Will… I’m already friends with you again! I love seeing a man that can dig deep emotionally and articulate his feelings. I truly believe the apology was sincere and I’m praying for you Will. Remember even a just man can fall several times but it’s the getting back up that matters. Life is sooo complex and we all experience set backs and setups. Im a Follower of Jesus Christ and forgiveness is a huge part of my creators teaching.. perhaps my creator understood the human condition.   Im reminded of Donnie Mcklurkin song, “We fall down, but we get up … for a saint is just a sinner who fell down … but he didn’t stay there and got up”..  Much continued love to you and your family!
No, did not land it my friend !
You deserve all the disrespect men
this is going in my cringe folder
Will, I'm sorry your not Pac. That's seems to problem on your relationship
All the people who criticize after an apology. Think they so righteous and perfect. We are all humans we make mistakes. What more do you want from him?
Dude, this is as sincere as an apology as Jada’s apologizes towards you! 🤡🤡
Hostage
Will eres el Mejor
Nope.
If you find a gold mine specifically for me in ecuador please tell me
Chin up Will one second of crazy don’t erase the good person you have been over the years. The good person you still are.
A REMINDER , To Will Smith & Family & ALL HUMANITY  ON YOU TUBE : Osinachi Nwachukwu  ( The Cry ) Video
what a great actor 😂
Had anyone else done what he did they would’ve been handcuffed and arrested. I’m not sure how anyone could be a fan of Will after this. And they shouldn’t. This apology feels disingenuous as well.
All of you who trying  to black list this man, where are yall on Tiffany Haddish and Aries Spears??? Are your faves calling that out???
I'm a brazilian fan, of both, and I'd love to see you finally get over it and be friends. Man, that'd be awesome!
Ooooohfuuuuuucknooooooo 😂 somebody help this guy
Love you Will. You have been a stand up guy your whole career and you messed up, which is a human thing. It is, in an odd way, nice to know that you are only human. I still look up to you. Don’t beat yourself up too much, because you are fallible just as we all are. Thank you for being the man you are, and thank you for sharing your reflections and being vulnerable with everyone. Much love from a lifelong fan.
My boy come back to us and show us what you can do.
Why do we expect celebrities to be perfect? If we look into our own past, Im suuuurre we've done worse...much worse!!! Will Man, all sons of Adam are born to do error, and the best of us, are those who feel remorseful and repent after their sins. God bless you 🙏❤️
Too late to apologize a-hole  You only apologize because everyone has turned against you
Putting light love and joy into the world is good. But putting truth into the world is better. And to do that you need to find out what is the Truth the Way and the Life. Or Who.
The man made a mistake and apologised. Perhaps this is his way of expressing himself being an actor. If he wasn't genuine he wouldn't have left the comments section open for you all to comment. Give the guy a chance. We all do mistakes. True it was a really bad mistake, but I am sure many of us did much worse.
It was so cringy and artificial that I couldn't watch after couple of minutes.
I love you no matter what I always will you are awesome you are human we all make mistakes keep your head up boo.
Will is a talented artist , he did one big mistake but who didn’t ?,, thank you to will for all the great movies and /laught and fun  he gave us
Seriously man have some self respect. No woman is worth this kind of humiliation.
This makes me sad.
Ya know you dressing like tiger woods doesn't really help
Why does he need to apologize publicly so ridiculous keep it between you two personally and leave it at that no reason to do all this publicly
Forgiveness is the highest human form we possess… We are all human.. we all make mistakes…this was a mistake a bad judgement call…he showed remorse and we can forgive…✌️😎✨
Love you, will and all smith family
Listen, Will. As you were preparing for your 50th birthday, you put it out into the universe that you were probably ready for an epic failure. You received the fruit of your lips. Perhaps you said it because you sensed it was coming, or perhaps your words changed your spiritual chemistry/atmosphere and attracted this. It has happened. You have proven to the world that you are not infallible. We needed that. You have learnt from it. Please forgive yourself. Make the amends necessary and move on. God bless you in your journey.
Oh so glad you're back. We're all human. There is not a single human who can react perfectly in all situations. I beat myself up over my emo reactios all the time. I'm grateful i dont have he whole world nagging in my ear about it. The two things to realise, as students of our creator are: 1. we learn the theory of Godliness. Then comes the practice. Its a definite and a must that we fail here. Because practice builds mastery. You HAVE to know that which you are not and don't want to be to know that which you want to be 2. God uses many scenarios to help us achieve the type of human we wish to be. Some are little simple scenarios. Others are bigger more difficult scenarios   You got this champ. You are coming through something revolutionary. and i just know you are one of those people who will produce something extraordinary from it. God gives His toughest battles to His strongest soldiers. The soldiers He knows are wise enough to firstly learn what He is teaching and second to pay thay forward to he world.   I can't wait for your next chapter. Its going to be amazing. Even if its not in the public eye. Goodness knows you've done more than enough already for the public. Now is your time.   The cold shoulders may just be a blessing in disguise...some me time. Maybe thats just me. When people are mad at me, its my me time lol  Welcome back Will. Missed ya too much
clap clap clap. well scripted and executed piece of play. you have a great production team.
I hope people stay open minded and forgiving. Will, you have entertained so many for years and I am grateful for all the time I've spent watching you.   We are all human and make mistakes. I will hold on to my stone since I have done many things that I could and should be stoned for.   Sending love and encouragement to you and your family.

The amount of haters on here are crazy. He’s just a dude, everyone makes mistakes lol if it was vice versa it wouldn’t have been this detrimental to Chris lol
We love You Will!! You are a good person.
🤡
I love you Will
I’m just seeing this but I don’t care what happened people learn from their mistakes and Will is a good man and has always been someone I look up too. That will never change love yah brother
Bad boys for life? Nah I'm good.
nah
One single move can ruin you Logan paul did Will did You shouldn’t  Have self control

p3do
Rich man physically strikes someone in a public place, nothing happens. Now he probably spent more money on equipment, staging, and other bullshit to make his little apology video than most people make in six months. No one cares about your apology or your mental trauma for "letting people down". Hollywood's elites don't play by the same rules. No one cares.
I've never been a Will Smith fan. He always seems so fake to me, especially his "laugh."   This, though, is the one-and-only time he seems real.
So it was for real?
*Will, we all have our time. It's over though. Seriously, man. Take a step back and understand this. You've had a good run, but you've put a lid on it. One that's not coming off no matter how hard you try. So, take your money, your life, your time and enjoy what you've got. Otherwise you're gonna end up wasting all the time you have fighting for what's already gone like a dude begging for his ex to come back when she's gone and never coming back. You might be able to make a cameo at some point like 10 or 20 years down the road, but for now, it's all over.*
I think this “apology” and I use that term loosely is just a little too late. Your actions were that of a child not a grown man who is supposed to be a role model for the younger generation.
just smacked a dude there was no truama
bro no one got hurt if anything will is the victim
🙃🤦‍♀
It hasn't even been 6 months, and Will Smith is so anxious to get back to the screen and social life I don't believe nor trust his apologies are even for Chris Rocks!!
I Love you Will Smith!
People judge will like they haven’t done anything In their lives. He gave y’all years of his life. Laughter love and your favorite cinematic moments. The man had a mental breakdown. But yet mental health matters so much to y’all. The hypocrisy is disgusting. Nobody is perfect… we better than this. Stones In a glass house people…
months later this is still a horrible a cting job
Through gritted teeth this is, lolz.
I don't see any gentility in this" this is another self-aggrandizing project " Will's public relations people were telling him that his numbers were dropping and that he needed to do something. 😆
This dude been a fraud for so long that it’s a part of him. He’s been exposed and he’s at the point of no return. He’s literally his own worst enemy at this point.😂😂
my thing is yes it was wrong but if the man was truly sorry he would not had excepted that award and gave it back!
Quite the actor, not great, just almost believable.
a very good fake appology
Buh bye phony
Love the background props. 🙄🙄
You are over.  Go away.  Stay away.
Hello mister will smith if yu read this message i will tell yu.  Are you so great like Muhammad Ali?. are yu a champ ????? 😀Then proof it now. I want to see your come back. Then it's your turn. Proof that yu can do it. 😀.  It's now it's happening ,Can yu get up?like a champ? This is now your turn and it's the movie of your life that yu re playing. I wish yu the best .😀😀😀. And I m nobody to judge yu..
Will just needs to let it go, he seems deep into it.
i hate that we can't see the dislike number now.. c'mon YouTube!!!
hostage video
Yall should box each other to settle it
You  never even said that you're "sorry." Lol
Wow... amazing how people simply refuse to accept your apology.  They must think they are better than you. Just ignore the haters and be strong Will.  What you did was wrong, but if Chris keeps harboring hatred in his heart, after several heartfelt apologies, then it is no longer your problem.
Breaks my heart because this man did so greatly for years until then. Everybody loved him, and he didn't have to change the color of his skin. The pride of Philly & all black folk, plus Hispanics. Yes, I believe in the power of forgiveness, but this is like a tear in the canvas of a beautiful work of art. No matter how awesome & glorious it is, you'll still focus on that one small significant tear. 98% greatness effected by that 2% error.
Because Will Smith is a bitchass baby boy. Most people are Weak, Pathetic, and Obedient. Acting like idiotic children and acting or speaking without thinking. If he was speaking the truth then he would not have done what he did in the first place. STUPIDITY!
The real bullshit would be if this video was monetized.
Howmany "uhmm" you want?  Yes.
Jesus, people are still talking about this?
It looks like a hostage video
Will s : Yaaaaaaaa, its rewind time :D
Reported for spam and misleading
oh my god   you are my example
Wait, is this an apology or a plug to "Shop the Will Smith store"?
"I'm not trying to think of myself as a piece of sh*t" - but oh you should bro cause that's what you are.
The thing that looks bad is the diffrent camera views, to much production in this apology.
Hey kids, if you want to see what insincerity looks like, here you go.
Hostage video lmao!!!
Any of y'all ever screw up Royally? I have... If any of you want my stone, you can have it. I'm not qualified to throw it...
Everyone of us makes mistakes, yours are just public. One incident cannot define who you are, despite what Dave said. Thanks for the positivity and representation of Black excellence throughout all these years.
Mr Smith, you have my full support. This guy bringing up HIS issue to divert the heat from negative attention because of his loose lips evolves into more ugly.  Peace to you.  If you can keep your head when all about you        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,     But make allowance for their doubting too;
I really loved this guy and his movies....
Thats some slappin aopolgy
I really am still surprised anyone cared more than "Oh ok" and move on with their lives. I'm realizing people dont actually have any life to live and so they get on youtube and social media to bring others down because they feel lonely if they dont do that. To anyone stuck in that cycle, you wont actually think you are but if you reflect on your actions and get out of the city lights n go for a stroll through the woods with no tech, youll actually be able to think for yourself and enjoy free-will.

Sounds very robotic
Dude is fake !!! Ill never watch a movie of his again and I used to love it all from the Fresh Prince to every movie he ever made. I thought he was a great man but Not Any More and Never Again!!!
For the simple Fact that he's a good actor it's hard for people to know if this is genuine.
I love you and Chris, 2 Gladiators.  IMO better add Chris and Tony to bad boys IV  and let them take your check 😂 Or make a movie as if comedians had a secret society 🙌🏿
so he want to be relevant again. but his timing was off
A+ production values. Multiple camera angles, professional editing, fading text. This is how you make a sincerely staged apology.
Y’all are mean. He made a public, human mistake and is trying to make amends the only way he knows how
Oh that's hot! That's hot! 😂😂😂
No amount of coming out as Bi will save you
Yaaa its rewind time
You used to be my favorite actor. I am very disappointed. And to your “apology”: Great Acting as always 🤦🏻👎🏼
It’s a shame that most don’t know how to give grace even though we’ve all been given unmerited grace from the only one that truly matters. (Ephesians 2:8)
I personally believe that this public apology was a mistake. Better to speak to Chris directly when he’s ready to talk. Although this was a very public mistake Will made, I don’t believe a public apology is necessarily the best way to handle it.
R.I.P.
Yawn.
The dude lost all creditably. We loved his work, now we don't know. He seems toxic. We seem to still be mourning.
He needs to make more money so wants “this thing” to be forgotten, that’s why he didn’t apologize in his acceptance speech but now. This family is “phony” that’s what I think. I hope I’m mistaken because he’s made some good movies… 🤔
Hollywood dont need bullies
I just want to see him do something special for Chris
난 당신이 행복 할거라 생각이 된다. 또한 행복 할 것이다. 앞으로도 응원 할것이다^^
What a BS "apology."
Love you so much Will ❤️
So no one has made a mistake or been pushed in a corner and acted rash? Must be fantastic to be so perfect and pass judgement!
Did he seek advice from Logan Paul?
We love you man!! ♥️😎👍
I believe you, but my Tommy gun don't ! !!
Love you Will and praying for you.
Being human in a world where people never recognize their own faults and issues is almost impossible! Will Smith and family lives are on blast daily - sometimes by choice but most times not. I ask this world to show them some grace. I am super impressed by Chris Rock’s maturity and forgiving heart not to make the situation worse, and this very public person, Will Smith, is doing what ALL OF US should be doing - humbling himself and finding the resources to address the pain childhood and adulthood experiences have indelibly left that would cause him to harm others. I only leave this message because I see very few comments that reflect encouragement or an extension of grace. Or much acknowledgement that we all have done things far far worse.
Tragic
this feels fake.
get back man
Eres un grande . Se q estas en mi lindo país Ecuador.  Como quisiera conocerte .
Anyone wondering how many dislike is there today? 263k as in right now
This isn't an apology. This is a cry for help. This man looks trapped.

You think your the best. Someone needs to humble you. Also I won't forget how to referenced gangsta rap in your Grammy acceptance speach. I use to look up to you
Trying to save your career you dropkick
Lame
Your apology is like when a mom tells you to apologize but you don’t wanna
a real man appolgizes respect to will hes a good guy
When you understand that because of your scandals you risk not taking part in any movie anymore:
grade a+ clown
When’s the new season of bel air coming ?
Yo will u know u ain't welcome back in Philly..... U better hire a ton of cops to protect u cuz u are dead there's too much money on ur head to pass up
I hope you see this. Not only come back stronger but rebranded. Need that old idgaf will back
They had to give me these drugs so they can say I'm schizo frantic because this is what these drugs cause and a very close to being a parasite
Will, I know you are going through alot. But I would like to say that our CLM community opens their arms to you if you need a place to chat and express your self. CLM welcomes anyone and should not be scared to join as this is a very constructive supporting community. Stand tall and proud! CLM!!
Simpin ain't easy
I hope you’re in a better place!
LOL THIS MAN IS DONE. !!! 🤣🤣🤣 JUST BECOS OF A LADY !!! OMG !!!
윌 형에게 사람의 마음은 같다고 생각해 다만 그 마음을 받아들이는 그 사회의 일반 상식에 따라 다른 반응을 보인다고 생각해 한국에서는 가족을 욕하는 것은 있을 수 없는 일이야 다만 다른 문화권에서는 그 차이가 있는 것 같아 혼란스러워하는 윌형을 안아주고 싶다 그 다름을 모두 이해하게 된다면 인류는 모두 신이 될거야 윌형 힘내
We all make mistakes in life but this is a genuine apology so give the guy a break and let’s move on. Well done Will.
Дурацкая западная культура отмены. Приходится извиняться за правильные действия, чтобы тебя не отменили полностью

I was watching 12 years a slave and thought wow WILL SMITH NEEDS TO DO A SLAVE MOVIE!!!! ALL your emotions can be POURED into a slave film....we need this WILL come back to us please...we love you Will Smith you are our King
Will, you problaby don't read this message, but me as a random stranger thinks you as a special person in the world, you give ten of millions of people a smile on their faces including me the last 25 years I can remember. And now the world is changing and everybody has to share theirs opinion about something, it is really hard for a lot of people to say: "Yes we makes all mistakes, but everybody got a second chance" Will, you will always be loved, as many other people. Ofcourse this message isn't only for Will Smith, but its in general to all people who makes mistakes, you get a second chance!
It's been months.......
wasn't he already "working on himself" with all these videos of him going on vacations.. oh yeah thats it.. thats what they were. vacations.
L
Karma will hurt you more idiot...
Your second sentence 'he's not ready to talk...' yet again, blames Chris.  Make it about him, not you.  Now that would be a genuine apology.   What I'd like to know is, who is coaching you?  They're not doing a very good job.   I think, in that moment, you were trying to be a man in an attempt to protect the woman in your life.  However, an honourable man would have settled it off-stage.  Not in the public eye.   The only thing you needed to say was say 'Chris.  I'm sorry.  Forgive me?'  and allow it come from your heart.  In this video, it seems you're trying to rebuild bridges to save your career.  It's not from the heart.
I wonder how many dislikes this video would've had...
Smiling faces are the worst people
So many people here are just the worst he is answering the biggest questions people have been repeatedly asking him over the time that it happened so I can understand why this is in a Q&A kind of apology he's not only apologizing to Chris he's apologizing to everyone by answering their questions giving his reasons I can understand that I don't see why the rest you don't i get it he did something extremely bad and he is not going to live it down but some of yall are taking it way out of pocket he is a man that made a mistake let him live it down instead of trying to brake him down more.
clap clap. it's takes alot of guts and hunility to admit you were the culprit of it all and nothing exterior had any influence.  to the people who think this is fake, I'm sorry for you all who have been severely tricked to the point of irreparable.  that's all
Just remember you're still an absolute legend Will Smith.. You were just overwhelmed with emotions and we all make bad decisions sometimes...
O J was more sorry than this clown.
Love
god i wish i could see the dislikes
Aaand cut
I think you have been screwed over by a woman who obviously has a hold over you. And there's really nothing you can do about that, I hope you both find peace. Don't listen to what anyone says. Alot of understand making stupid mistakes in the heat of the moment
You know, as much as people ain’t liking this apology, I’m gonna give him the benefit of the doubt. I believe that Mr. Smith can change.
OH MY GOD... Will! Plz find your OWN life!!!
People make mistakes, but simply because he’s Will Smith, that mistake has been amplified a thousand times. It’s going to take time.

God bless your PR firm who is doing their best to make these apologetic videos and save your career.
when someone says "I apologize to you" not "I'm sorry", it means that they are not sorry at all. Notice how he said: sorry babe.
Observe carefully and you can see Jada's hands under the seat squeezing his nuts
Will the devil is your Mrs.. time to take stock and be honest.  I get the actionsand buildup to it, but the source is playig to your nice side time to look after your self bro. xx
Well can’t lie still one of my favourite actors even with all this bs tbf 😕
words dont hold the same weight as actions
proof you be great all of your life and one bad action will take it all away...🤔
Forgiveness is the process of coming back to unconditional love. 💖 May both Chris and Will find peace at the Center of it All. 🙏🏾✨
This apology makes my girlfriend look real
What about your wife's boyfriend?
My name is Jin, a big fan of yours My English is not good, so I will speak briefly "You're being used by her now. Please live your life." Please, please Your avid Korean fan......
Come on indians time to boycott will smith 😂😂
Amazing how so many turned on Will this man have been perfection did one thing out of pocket and the world turns on him just another example of living while being black 🤦🏽‍♂️  Love you Will keep going!
classic will smith and you dont have to thanx to all of us
As a huge fan who’s looked up to you as an idol, during that “moment,” you did let me down. But Mr. Smith I understand you and I forgive you. Of course life is not always sunshine and rainbows. But it’s also not always dull, revolting, unforgiving, and so on; people live and learn. Failure is the greatest teacher in life and I know that you can bounce back from this. Don’t be traumatized Mr. Smith, I forgive you.
It was just a single mistake guys. I think we all are overreacting
Yeah. You know, okay.
It’s not how you fall, it’s how you get back up💯
You were my golden standard for a lovable and respectable celebrity. That you are no longer. You have greatly disappointed me and many others, I don't think I will ever like you ever again. It feels like you were faking it this whole time. Hopefully, you will be able to show us who you REALLY are.
The comments, damn!! No Mercy.
Sounds like apologie i gabe to my brother when mom made me, ahahhaha.  this is pathetic try to save reputation,sometimes no apologie is better than one.

MS-DOS acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System, also known as Microsoft DOS) is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and a few operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as "DOS" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.   IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993.   Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI.
Well gawwh damn
I know many think this is fake but, as someone who has had people fake apologize to me over and over all my life. I tend to recognize fake and real apologizes.   I may be wrong, but I do feel this is a genuine apology
So you make an apology video but be promoting your sons Water. How many mores things can you get wrong.
Nice ad for his son’s company « Just Water » #justwater #justbs
Sadhguru jee ......🙏
This is a genuine as a get well card from an undertaker.

He deserve a chance. Let us not be woke.
Dude. Your a multi millionaire and probably make millions in royalties a year. Just bounce dude. You won’t be hurting. Your career is basically gone and probably for your families too. But hey you still banking.

Just amazed by all the perfect ppl in the comments pouring hate on a man acknowledging his mistake and trying to apologize. Easy to stand in the shadows of your unremarkable life where nobody cares about all the terrible things they have done and condemn. We all are capable of great deeds and terrible deeds being a good person is a daily struggle in this messed up world. I hope Will and anyone else who reads this and has been down to the low place will was can keep away from that negative energy and vibe.
I forgive you Will. I really hope you can find peace.
Who will smith? I don’t remember
2022 rewind will slamming memes lol
They were premature when they thought the hero was falling apart. 😂🤣
If anyone made it through this entire 6 minutes god bless them 🤣😂 I lasted 2:10
Look all I can say is that everything is in the past, even the the apology is not good atleast he's still recovering and saying sorry, thats all I can say
Idk man. Love you, but this reeks of failed stereotypical 2010's Youtube Apology Video format. Dawg it's 2022. Leave her, apologize, and throw Crhis the biggest party this earth has ever seen. You're not the good guy in your story anymore. I used to believe in you.
Was für eine arme Socke
I still respect Will. Everyone has a moment of weakness and unfortunately his was infront of the whole world. I really hope you can recover from this.
He needed time off, he did wrong but this apology is genuine. Good luck Will.
ive got the best idea for the next bad boys movie why dont you get clint eastwood to play dirty harry it could be funny as hell
Has his wife's hand up his butt during this whole apology using him like a puppet to try and save face 🤣
It's been 5 fuckin months, people have forgotten to forgive, yet whenever they do something wrong they as for forgiveness. Why are you still hating on this man?
The most dishonest thing I’ve ever seen
It's cool now man...
This whole situation is making me sad. I try to make sense of what God wanted us to learn from this event. I think his message is that real life isn't a movie. Today's kids are more easy on the keyboard and on the streets. Everyday I read about youngsters that are bullying their classmates, physically and on the net. They learn bad stuff from social media, and acting accordingly in reality. It's time for a new initiative to raise awareness about this topic. The power is in your hands, Will- literally, only this time for the better. May God bring us peace, Amen.

MAY I SAY YOU WERE BOTH IN THE WRONG
About time we all forgive Will Smith. Everyone makes mistakes, to err is to human now let’s move on!!
This is a horrible apology "speech"  . You did this only for yourself.
These YouTube apologies are so weird to me, the dramatization of sighing and having a produced atmosphere seems very self victimizing and wanting to gain pity from everyone, rather than actually apologetic to the person you hurt.
Why is this still being talked about? Move on and do better. Yeesh.
Will, if you really mean that then good for you man... You are a great actor no doubt. I hope you recover from all the hate you are receiving.
We're on your side Will don't let Jim Carrey talk about you like that.
lol .. mate dump that mind controlling vampire youre with .. weve all been there, its not like we arent sympathetic .. but nobody will ever trust you while shes still there. Youve got to choose .. unfortunately

Trying to convince my mom im sorry so she can let me have my snack
That night the real Will Smith was shown to the world cus his damm fake.
when's the apology video for the apology video coming out?
Will Smith, you are far from a piece of sh*t. If I love you this much as a stranger, I can only imagine how much your family and friends love you.
How am I just now seeing this!?
So many perfect people in the comment's section. Wow. Saints galore!  Well said Will. Who knows where temporary insanity, rage, confusion comes from. If you take psych meds even that can alter your brain activity and behavior. Trauma can do this, alcohol, etc.
Wario
A just water theatrical commercial. Nice one.
I liked will smith. Now I feel like he could go All "I-robot" on Anyone at any moment. He could just randomly trip out and "I am legend" anyone that looks at him wrong. What are we teaching our kids? We can just "men in black" people who make you mad?
Love you Will we are all Human…
Wtf why you like to be a cuckold? 😅😅😅
Most annoying is that dude can't say a single word without thinking about it for 5 seconds. I want an apology from you f'n HEART! Camoon.... speak from your heart!!! That will fix SO much, so why can't you do it....
Don't you are best .will sir
Yeah this is good and all but did you know that Instagram has over 1 billion users where more than 65% are women?
Will, pls stop play this game 🙈
@willsmith only worthless people take aggressions to the level you did, I used to watch you on fresh prince of Belair, I even used to sing along when MTV would play parents just don’t understand, but I guess you’re the parent that just don’t understand,  You partying it up later that night while everyone was high-fiving you over what you did, no matter how many awards you win, no matter how many alkali do you have, I’ll spit on your shoes if I see you.  You deserve to think of yourself as a POS, because only a POS would do what you did   I’m 1 foot in the gutter, an absolute nobody, you wouldn’t even look at me twice in public, but the difference is I know who you are, and I know I’m a better man than you are.
Will is still playing a persona, trying to hide himself from his own self. He is not real. This video just shows it.
He apologized, it’s over we all make mistakes. Take it or leave it. We’re all human PERIOD
So much negativity surrounding this situation... The sharks were waiting apparently. Keep ya head up Will, you're human, we all make mistakes. You're still my idol.
Sigue adelante will aveces es necesario dejar cosas atrás aunque  nos duela para entender que nuestra vida es mejor sin apegos
I don't buy a single word.
All these ugly comments are so very unnecessary. You're not in this man's shoes and you know damn well people make mistakes. He's trying, he's just being human. Let it go! None of you, in these comment, were hurt by what he did. Move on!
Wtf did it take to us long to figure out you didn to e wrong thing? Dude, are you that inhuman?
dude you're completely human. there's a lot of people that forgive you (myself included). who of us hasn't done something they regret and are deeply ashamed of? who of us hasn't let people down? not sure this deserves as much psychological real estate in your mind as it's getting. mistake made, life goes on, and you're still an amazing person in 99,999 other ways!  one wrongdoing doesn't wipe out thousands of good deeds. now you are like the rest of the flawed heroes, loved despite their limitations! HUGS.
Sincere.
It's time to buy an island and retire, man. You've enjoyed the life of privilege that very few get to to experience. And you have ruined it with your actions.
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY WILL AND I FURTHERMORE SUPPORT ALL OF YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS
IM THE BOSS OF ALL GODS
Will, you are my absolute favorite person in the world and people need to get over it and understand that your still the same awesome person you were as the fresh prince of bel air and just move past what happened cause you apologized
Look at his ankles 🤖
Crei crei
Still a fan! Please don't let this issue overshadow all the positive things this man did 🙏🙏🙏
I find it ridiculous because a lot of streamers have sinned and done controversial things. When things break out, they post an apology video and then stay out of the spotlight for a while. The reason they were able to start streaming again and keep their fans was because it was fun for them to watch again
this is so heartbreaking. Seeing one of my favourite person, becoming so vulnerable and  depressed. I hope chris forgives you for what happened and everything becomes normal
It would've been better if you just directly apologized to Chris discreetly rather than posting this.
We ARE ALL HUMANS , WE UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND , thank for This video ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
wow.
DISGUSTING!
Thanks will
not the cool club anymore - you hollyweird leftist propaganda machine. Ghostbuster 2016!
Will you were one of the most loved and likeable celebrity... TF happened man???
a lifetime of idolization as a person driving positive change shattered in an instant. save the pity party, you are what you do.
take another minute and come back with a real apology.
lol love how the will smith store is linked in the description
CLM✊
The world be like sorry a bit too late lol
Bro I'm in my 30s and I have better self control, I have better self knowing and I'm able to not get angry over mental products jeez
This is probably one of the apologies ever made.
Me acabo de suscribir no  entiendo inglés  Acabo de ver en la tv que estás  otra vez en la redes sociales  Todo mi apoyo  y no tienes que pedir perdón cuando defiendes lo que amas  Eres un grande y mi suscripción  está ahí para siempre  Un abrazo campeón
Booooooooo!!! 👎🏽
Im greatful that you talking to us will
I wonder how many takes he had to do
When you are the fun one like Will, who listens to his not so fun days?
we love you Will!!
Love uuu
WOW. His cadence is the same as Jada’s. He needs to find his way back to himself and the realness of life, not the big show. Just real life. And yes he should be ashamed of himself. And move on.
yo homie, you'll get through this, I'm building a small barn in Arizona if you wanna come help, get your mind off things. you're human, take a break.
WOW  PLEASE CHECK YOUR EMAIL
🍋✊CLM
You have damaged something far more important than your image, or the face of another actor, with your outburst. You have damaged the sense of safety and the freedom that any civilized society needs to question, criticize, even roast others with nothing but WORDS. Your impact to humane and civil discourse is the greatest damage in all of this.
This was a deeply heart felt apology. Thank you for posting. People are human. We all make mistakes. We can feel bad about what we did and make choices not to do it again. Everyone in this thread of comments has made both small and massive mistakes that changed the course of their lives and others lives. We must forgive ourselves, ask for forgiveness and move forward. You modeled that with this apology. No one is above a mistake. Everyone is capable of forgiveness.
Made my day!
Can you make more videos please
Awesome video!
Bliss!
When will the next video drop?
;)
Wish I would have seen this earlier.
:)
Incredible video!
Love it
Great video
Enjoyed it!
So good
He Should Have Started With “ Now This Is A Story All About How My Life Got Flipped Turned Upside Down”
Haaaaa. Even has the typical YouTube apology Sigh. This one was off camera. The man is a professional.
The one massively noticeable blemish on his career. And boy isn’t it noticeable, unfortunately for Will.
Make this a meme 😂
All this production value and they couldnt remove that white lamp in the background that makes his white cap look stupid…
Will, stay encouraged. You have fans that forgive you. I encourage you to forgive yourself. Stay around those who love you. What happened was a build up of many things.
0:41 "The world is sick. Love is the cure." You should consider taking this quote off your wall, Mr. Smith.
I love you Will. We all have our rough moments.... don't be too hard on yourself..
Will, I seriously dislike you now, I honestly do. Nevertheless, I hope you get better. You should speak to Logan Paul, he managed to pull it off.
True fans are still behind you will, keep your head up 🙏🏻
27 march 2022 was 149 days ago! Just know that if it took me that long to apologize for this I was either dead, kidnapped, mental illness, blamed others for my actions, or was still holding a grudge. I wonder what his reason is???
Don't loose your character by saying apologise to that bludy incident..  Love will Smith always 😍
No need to apologise bro...  U did a right thing. Love will Smith always 😍
Will Smith I'm always with you Love you always 😍
We still love you will! You know who always got your back! ✊🏾✊🏿✊🏽✊🏼
Sick of hearing the ‘I was fogged out’ excuse. You behaved like a Thug. Having time to come up with these responses doesn’t do you any favours either.
LMFAO
Go away.

Damnit Will.  Find the Fresh Prince.  You can still be THAT guy again.  But you're gonna have to cut out the toxicity from your life.  I was a Pennsylvania kid when you were coming up in Philly.  I remember when you were  that charming guy with a lot of potential.  I got one of your albums on casette tape for my birthday one year during the 80s.   I miss THAT GUY.  THAT guy wouldn't let a dysfunctional person break him down into what we see today.  West Philadelphia, Born and Raised.......  BE.  THAT. GUY.  Not Will Smith.  THE Fresh Prince.
He can memorize the lines of a 3 hour movie, but he couldn't memorize a 5 min fake apology and read it from a prompter. You are a disgrace.
This should be an apology for youtube rewind
bruh this video isn’t even an apology video 💀💀
Punk.
F what you heard Will WE love you 💯💙
Hey Mr. Smith it was good that you were in a Tennis movie because obviously since I play tennis, it is the top sport in the world
The work phone stopped ringing it seems
sacowea
I love you Will
Once you discover the hidden influences and their pathways into your consciousness and also when you learn why they are so powerful  you can see the entire process of these influences at work coming into your consciousness and understand their impact on your mind and behavior
Good perfect think positive of yourself  Basically some powerful influence hijacked your mind and you could not help but to react in that alternate reality
Will, you have nothing to apologise for. A man cannot defend against an influence that is powerful and unknown.
When he said tarnised instead of tarnished. I realized he was reading a teleprompter script
Come on y’all I mean this is what he can do he said Chris was not ready to talk yet and we will get that but come on now he’s is a human being
I love you Will. People get to make mistakes. We are not perfect. We let our emotions get the best of us. It happens. I can't wait for your next movie, or project. Got your book too!
What a despicable act you did Will. Society will never forget what you did to Chris that day. You're a disgrace forever!
You should be forgiven by Chris and all fans. This was a genuine apology. ❤️ All people make mistakes.
He deserved it Will. Don't feel bad. Did he apologise to Jayda? No.
You should apologize to Chris in private not to your fans on YouTube
Why is this dude wearing a Wario hat???
there’s no need to apologise to us.. we weren’t the ones hurt. u should’ve apologized to chris right after (or even better, not have done it), but you didn’t, and chris doesn’t want to talk to you and you have to respect that. you fucked up 🤷🏾‍♀️
Omg I wanna puke
Don't apologize that is all
He ruined his reputation in one night.
Still defending her. Jesus. 🤦‍♂️
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

Youtuber
You’re still my King Will Smith The MF Prince of Bel-Air damn ;)
Fake
Your career is over, man. Good riddance. Biggest disappointment in Hollywood.
And still... no matter how he would've apologized... he did something drastically stupid in the worst place and time of his career, too many people will never accept an apology. It's something I realize way too often, people not accepting apologize, but yet they demand one and it'll never be good enough. Time and effort ultimately will heal any bad wound created, but an apology, no matter how it's made, if it's sincere and honest (even if it looks weird at times), it's the least a person can and HAS to do!
It’s actually been 175200.192 minutes
Sometimes one action can turn the world against us and no matter how sorry we are, people are so biased to see it. I wish you well ❤️. Keep being the best version of yourself and remember that the God who sees the heart is the final judge of man.
The title changed from ``It's been a while" to `` It’s been a minute"
I was expecting a Homelander type response. I'm disappointed.

Hey Will! I grew up watching Fresh prince everyday after school and watched how you grew into a huge movie star and being ultra successful. With all that rise something will bring u down eventually, but if u can go through it and rise above nothing can stop you. Don't worry about it ur still the coolest guy on and off the camera. Stay true!😎👍
I'm don't  normally comment and normally the people that do are negative people... but you changed many lives with kind gestures and uplifting words... I believe your apology is sincere, come back to the world your  real fans miss you, ignore  negative comments ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
Yeah, you were all fuzzy that night, but not fuzzy enough to accept that standing ovation and get jiggy with it at the after party lol.
Big respect, Will.  I hope everyone involved can see the growth coming from your side, and then forgive.  And I pray (and know) that in time you too will forgive yourself. No one in this world gets out alive without making some big mistakes. It’s unfortunate that the entire world got to see yours.  But, people need to remember that this is one great big glass house.  Redemption looks good on you! This will make you stronger. It already has.  This too shall pass. I personally believe this was somehow all perfect.  We got to see that even the greatest stars in the world are real people, and perhaps it’s time the world embodies that fact.  Stay true to you despite the backlash.  You know exactly who you are.
will you should be president, as you read the excuse notes no one can, but as an actor you could have learned the script by heart in a few days. so I only give you a seven for the script and a 7 for the interpretation
Hold your head up Will. One moment in time does not change who you are and all you have done in the past. Good people can make bad choices. Fortunately, we all don't have to have it played out for all the world to see. No matter what you do there will be hateful people that continue to relish in your pain and wish you more. You are still loved by the people that matter.
America!An apology with product placement.Everything for the show!A really sick country where everything is fake
How bout you thank Chris for not pressing charges or suing you?
An apology really should be only two words "I'm sorry" Not all this theatrics B.S
hah, someone start to realise he has no more jobs in Hollywood.
❤
Mr.Lamont and CLM movement stands with you Will. #CLM 🍋✊
I think Will Smith would play an excellent David Goggins in biopic
This is the fakest apology since the OnlyJayus one. CLM ✊🍋
So fake and insincere.
Brave man
This comment section is brutal. Will allowing comments, knowing people will dog pile? These lashes may lead to his penance and build a bridge of forgiveness Chris R.  I have been there myself, I know when I'm weak when I have "yes" people around me and no wise people. A walk with someone who cuts through the mask & Fame seeking honor, one stumbles in their Hero's journey. I will hold you in my thoughts as you develop your inner strength. Life isn't any easier for wealthy, famous people, and perhaps more brutal like this comment section.
Mate, all you had to do is say I'M SORRY, I HAVE ACTED LIKE AN IDIOT.
Could’ve just go over to the mans house and apologise like a real man
lmao
Wearing a cap ads some tenor to this video
That kake apology is not for Chris it's for the public
I love will smith. Seems genuine (:
And for the #OscarsSoWhite & #TheAcademysSoWhite STANBASE out there…kick 🪨🪨🪨🪨s until y’all tumble down a steep ⛰ #StandWithWillSmith
Bro literally everybody forgot NOBODY cares abt this anymore
Eu te amo Will Smith!  Seja bem vindo de volta!
BYE- what is this💀
There is nothing sincere about this.  Call Chris on the phone and beg his forgiveness.  Period.  It doesn't require a production like this overly done, overly dramatic video.  I thought he was a better actor than this.  I guess not...
Well I love you I grew up watching you I don't blame you for what happened at the same time I don't approve of it either like you said you're human mistakes happen look we had put Trump in office we live and we move on as I think everybody should do with you Hopefully I'll see you in another movie or show
Am I the only one that feels like “I apologize” is more genuine than “I’m sorry”? I feel like “I’m sorry” is overused and often comes across as unapologetic. Just confused on the whole trip up of “I’m sorry” vs “I apologize”
There should be productive crew in the description with full credits to everyone. Very interested to know the professional who wrote the speech
It reminds presidents' speech were they pretend they speak from heart,  while someone else smart prepared the speech
Will definitely is a great actor
The apology is perfect, to the extent we don't know is it 100% genuine or is it the work of a team that analysed all the hate and came up with a great response and produced this video
"I'm sorry I attacked someone on live TV and got off scot free, I'm sorry people are not happy that I act like rich prick living in  a fantasy world.  I hope you can forgive me and keep buying my stuff and watching my movies, not that it would actually affect me but I could always get richer"
One more thing.. your life is sad.
Will this was a big deal, but just apologize, mean it in ur heart and let's move on. No one wants to hold you accountable for this moment for life. You been a good man for a long time, one bad moment not going to ruin your life. Anyone reading this; remember you need mercy so show mercy especially when someone repents and says sorry. Let's keep it moving towards love and life please.
DUDE WII LOVE YOU AND I WOD HAVE DONE THE SAMME MUTCHE RESPECKT
Whoever’s reading this, i pray that whatever you’re going through get’s better and whatever you’re struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
Hahah it's rewind time
Regardless will is definitely talented eventually everyone just gonna forget this happened
nuances and complexities....lol... like seriously...
You were my hero and now seeing you smiling between an apology is disgusting
Cannot believe you are still calling her babe
Will’s actions were absolutely wrong, and I appreciate him reaching out to Chris. I hope Chris reaches back. Life is too short to hold grudges and bitterness.
we love you will smith dont worry about apologizing its normal to be human
Chris should apologize
noone cares move on already😭😭
I think he is neither ready to apologize nor the other ready to hear him out.  But their managers or team or media control whatever they're called.   I feel like they're pushing these people to "play" the parts. Like, u guys taking too long, we are losing -day- lime light, it's about time u apologize and about time u take his apology, now kiss and makeup~~   it reminds me of Melanie Martinez song Doll House. lmao.
Much love and respect brother, ı think you're right peace is surely the best vlue that we could have, do you support Lakers? We're will get the championship for the next season ı believe, well hopefully lol
His production lighting is not bad but I expected maybe some dolly movement and probably some negative fill for that dramatic effect.
560,000,000
The only time when he was a bad actor.
Dislike numbers don't show. 🤔
why he talking like that
Why is bro reading like a 3rd grader. Isn’t his job to read stuff and act it out? Why…didn’t…you…apologize…to…chris……
Crap
Caraca, Will Smith? Super idol in shugun
Use me as a dislike button
I don’t know why it is anyones business just apologise to Chris and keep on doing what you do best.

Hello there! I just saw your video and I will tell you some things.. Even that you have no idea who am I, "I know you" since I was little and I follow your work since the first time we saw on tv in the Prince of Bel Air translated to spanish around 1988. We admire you. You are like any other human being with it's flaws and qualities. And like any other person you feel bad about what others think of you and like to be nice with anyone because it makes you feel good and happy.. many we've been there too.. and when we feel that we let them down for something that even if is not right, is not something so terrible irreparable for judging you so terribly, that's a breaking point for us to let them and let that go. We can't please everyone, that's never going to happen dear. I think you acted like a husband, and momentarily forgot that you are a public figure but that doesn't make you a terrible human. Don't believe the evil lies of the devil! Many people loves you and you deserve to leave that to rest. If that person doesn't want to talk to you is okay, you did your part. From the bottom of my heart I tell you this; the solution to any question or any problem you may have is so close to you, look into your heart, you have goodness in you and that goodness comes from God. Anything that troubles you, anything, give it to him he can heal everything, and anything is possible for him. The only one thing is "required" is a humble heart and repented heart, that's all, and you have that. Don't feel tormented for what's people is saying, they deserve respect, yes, but you do also deserve respect and love. You already paid for what you did with the easy judgement of many over you but they are not the whole public. And I tell you, you remind me my late brother for many reasons.. and you and your family deserve to be free and happy. Will, in the name of Jesus I bless you, I bless your family and your lives, bless your hearts and minds. We love you Will! We send you hugs and kisses darling! God bless!! Keep the faith! 💕
He made a mistake he's human. I still love Will and Chris I hope they can get past this. And I think they will.
Your manhood was hurt
you were Untouchable you had the cleanest background of anybody no one could have said anything negative about Will Smith
2:20 You can't say "there's no part of me" when it's something you literally did. So clearly part of you felt like that was an acceptable response. I can say something like "no part of me is a murderer" because it's absolutely true. I've never murdered someone and never would. It's not a part of me. It would be more honorable to see you own your actions a bit more. It's clearly a part of your to physically lash out, and the sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can address that.
❤️
When Will Smith said "it's morbin time!!" I legit cried in tears literally the best apology video to date 😭😭
The shame will be forever on you Will!
ارجع للأفلام يا ويل سميث ضعوا لايك عشان يوصل التعليق
Any without sin, cast the first stone… No one keeps it together all the time, we all fall short, keep your head up Will, no matter what, you’re still one of my favorite people.
You hypocrites
Your crazy
Sorriest apology ever.... i guess he succeeded in the being sorry part...

Love you will ❤️
let me get this straight you guys are upset that he's apologizing. honestly, people can't be real or fake without you guys criticizing it this is the world of entertainment I guess everybody is striving for the best comment but to be honest take the man's apology for what it is you don't have to like it or agree if it's fake but it's Him putting the effort in doing it. Some of you guys are ridiculous I see a lot of sheep in queues here who can't allow a celebrity to be human. Everyone has their moments and sometimes it's humiliating and most of the time it's done privately. we are all human and we all deserve to be treated that way. I wish all you guys get off your high on horses throwing rocks and start looking are your selfs
Idk if ur reading this but ur amazing dude. It’s just ur family dude they don’t deserve u they are pulling u down. You will never understand it. But hey maybe one day when its tooo late u we’ll see it
We Love You Will ❤️ Come on back! Apology accepted 🥰
Too late, go away
Всё в порядке Уилл ты хороший человек, и фильмы  с твоим участием такие же, не переживай по этому поводу, всякое бывает в жизни, расслабься и живи дальше😊, желаю чтобы у тебя по скорее все наладилось , ты мой любимый актер

When an apology is more about you than the people who were affected. Don't go out and make an apology video. It's just that simple. I hope your PR teams reads this and is careful next time.
In real life there is no uncle phil who got your back
Keep your head up Will… you giving a lot to this world we all make mistakes don't bet yourself down
I’m sorry Will you have lost all my respect
Love you will
I am 2 weeks late replying to this video. But, that’s not long considering it took over 20 weeks for this apology to come out. That’s my biggest criticism with all this.
You forgot to apologize to your wife's boyfriend.
You are not sorry. You hate Chris. End of story
Chris should still sue you
Chris should sue you
My son heard that you will be in a movie with jojo siwa but she left my son wanted to watch it that you and jojo siwa was that movie
In MIB International is Agent J Dead or Alive If he’s dead what happened or If he’s Alive Where is he now
Will, you'll be more respected if you leave her, then sincerely apologise to Chris OUT of the spotlight! This video was very disappointing and unnecessary. When will you learn?
will.. at least make this video full of ads people won’t like it anyways
it’s reagan time
love is the cure, yes everybody lets start slappin eachother
Bro is ok, don't worry, u are a human too, the mass media love to tear people down for money. I am not in the position where I can say what you must did, cause I have not experienced this thing, your reaction was natural🤍 "Humans must learn to love rather than compromise and destroy"xxxtentacion

There are two things you need to do in life to be happy. 1, Forgive others when they hurt you. If you cannot do this you will be hurt, possibly for years. 2, Forgive yourself when you do wrong. Nobody is perfect. If you cannot forgive yourself, you may carry shame for years. Be happy, and remember all the happiness you have brought people over many years.
Not good enough
It's not that big of a deal you are a human being you make mistakes.  I hope people get over this you deserve better
Würde so GERN Will mal persönlich kennen lernen. Er ist ehrlich und sehr sympathisch und gerade deswegen  haben wir unseren Sohn Jaden genannt. #WILL SMITH
🤡🤡
Give this man a rewind button
We feel bad for you will
The fact that he said “I reached out but he doesn’t want to talk yet” Is even lower bruh. Just leave the man alone.
Will do not beat up yourself. You are human. People make mistakes. You can overcome this. I still look up to you. Don't worry about how other's view you. Just be true to you.
Actors are stupid and uneducated. They don’t have qualifications to educate others.
Nawa
This is probably irreparable lol. Ughhhhh ya think?!
Took him this long to apologize publicly . Is it really an apology ?
He's shamelessly got his own company logo plastered across his forehead. He knew that this video would get a lot of attention. This is nothing more than marketing.
Yo... I know Will Smith is an actor, ok? But to be honest I don't feel he was acting in this. He's always been a genuine dude, and he's just being real. I feel like everyone's just hatin' because it's what everyone else is doing. Come on man people make mistakes. It's no excuse for his behavior but he's owning that. This is Will Smith and why we love/d him. We've all made our own mistakes. Would you like to be judged the way he's being judged? I hope him and Chris can work it out
🥺😔 Pensé q no volvería a escuchar su voz Dios te vendiga will 🍃❤️
Bro embarrassed himself even more. People moved on from this by now.
It's ok he was being a big mouth anyway your number 1
Nope … this is for Will and no one else . Should’ve reached out to Chris BEHIND the scenes. A meeting between two men in privacy leave the cameras out.
Goofy ahh
Remember people... you are watching a very very good actor. In front of a camera I might add.
❤️
am here for will Smith..
This is a mess. You didn't do the work you need to do before uttering an apology. And the result is a really bad kind of apology that won't change a thing, no matter how much money or brain power went into it. You missed the target by about a foot, namely by the distance between brains and heart.
You're still my man. Have been looking and will keep looking up to you!
MANNING UP,  APOLOGIZING, ACKNOWLEDGING FLAWS, MOVING FORWARD WITH GRATITUDE AND SELF-LOVE. ONE DAY AT A TIME WILL! GOD BLESS YOU!
Just apologize to Chris privately!  The publicity of all of this is just a PR stunt!
CLM ✊🍋
It sucks letting people down but in the end all that really matters is that you are right with God. I pray Jesus continues to draw you in and He gives you the peace that only He can give. Repent and turn to Him and watch what He does🙌 🙏 “Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:6‬ ‭NIV‬‬
I'm with you, Will!   First and foremost you have to forgive yourself!   Keep your head up! We all make mistakes! I'm so proud of you that you are owning it!  With that, you have to move forward and move pass this!  Hopefully, Chris will speak to you, but if he doesn't,  continue to do your work!   It's apparent you have grown from this!
Is that a Technics SL-1200 MkII in the back?
It is all good Will. We all have made mistakes. I'm not about to sit on a high 🐎 acting like I am any better. You're good in my book.
Will, there are moments in life when we find ourselves in the midst of doing something that is completely uncharacteristic almost as if we are outside of ourselves watching and saying "what the hell am I doing" and the moment it happens we are snapped back and the realisation of what we did sets in. The backlash was inevitable and I am sure that you have re lived that moment a million times trying to find any rational reason for your actions and unsurprisingly you can't and that is the positive part  because It demonstrates that you are a normal person. There are many incidents where someone has done something bad but is not prepared to accept they were wrong and have stood defient. I am sure that a lot of people will be thinking that all this contrition is just a way of limiting damage but I believe you are genuinely sorry and would give anything for this to have not happened. I believe that you are struggling with the damage to friendships and family but there is one thing to remember, you will never lose a real friend. They will be the ones who will call you out but they will also know that this is not the Will Smith they know and love. They will be the ones who will guide you towards the right path to build bridges and they will always be there to help the healing. I am a fan of your work and have no doubt that you will be ok in time. You just need to give yourself a break. Go spend time away from all this and reflect on your past and what it toom to get you to where you are and channel that commitment into doing something that you always wanted to do but never had a chance to make it happen. Don't let this incident define you and go to work on building your future. Your fans and Freinds though disappointed will always have your back. I will say a prayer for you. Stay safe J.
You know that everything about this is staged and fake when it's starts with a "sigh" coming from the culprit and the scene is full of product placement. You have let your fans down, your industry, but most importantly you have let your wife's boyfriends down.
This is one of those times where the dislike button on YouTube should have been still active.
I still love you Will. I know the ENFJ vibes. Everyone looking at you to lead them, then when your weakest moment arrives, everyone is like what!!?? Why did you fail us? Forgetting they asked you to be there even tho you were at your weakest moment… and in all honesty, the biggest mistake we ENFJ’s make is we shoulda just said no! It’s all about modesty hommie. Modest is key.
Is he Slappy coco from Zohan?
Omg how fake lol.
You have capabilities to win people's hearts by your work. It was a mistake, the heat of the moment. We love you will.
Amazing will your doing the right thing
not only when hy assulted chris but the way he party"d afterwords will not be forgotten,,,,
Will, I've been a fan for so long.. but, I love you when I say this... *LEAVE HER.*
CLM 🍋✊
CLM ✊🍋 #EROBBSTANDSWITHYOU
We all do things we're not proud of. I truly believe Will is a great man with true intentions that has done many great things not just for the camera. We're animals with basic instincts to protect our family and unfortunately, on this one occasion, will reverted to these basic instincts. Has he done it before? Will he do it again? I don't know. I know I've made mistakes and I'm pretty sure I will make mistakes in the future, I have the luxury of them not being publicly scruitinised. He made a mistake like we all do, and if nobody forgave people for their mistakes, where would we be? I forgive you Will and look forward to the next thing of yours I watch, new or old.
When you have a mental and spiritual break, because of ongoing destructive influences in your life.  When you actually act, it is never going to be constructive.  I have no idea what you were going through, I can only see you thru my actions.  It was a reflex and a response to being hurt and by a frustration of being powerless.  Strength, love, respect and find your way out of the dark.
Aww diddums, the bully finds out he's not so popular anymore.
He and his whole family are sick in their heads. The quintessential Hollywood family.
Notice how when he talk about Chris he say "I apologize" but when he talk about literally ANYONE ELSE h says "I'm sorry" this a publicity stunt, not a heartfelt apology.
CLM ✊🍋
CLM FOR THE WIN I STAND WITH YOU ELECTRONIC ROBERTS ps: britt i love you babe
Logan Paul’s apology felt more sincere.
how he went about it was both wrong and right. its normal for alot of people to have reactions like that idc who you are or what you say will smith wouldn't of been the only husband to do that.
🍋✊ CLM FOR LIFE!!!!
Pathetic
You did what you felt. Its not the end of the world.
I used to look up to this man, but now he is absolutely disgusting, so disappointed.
People talking about how they would forgive him or not. He didn't do anything to you. He done it to Chris. Now yea Will didn't need to do all of this. He need to do this with Chris. All of this public  Apologies is not needed. Will stop saying sorry to folks that had nothing to do with this. Go to Chris. Not us.
This is a man who went through so much and people still find dirt but I’ll tell you all something when I was a kid I watched the fresh prince of bel air it still is my favorite show but what’s important that people need to stop making fun of this man this man is my hero 🦸‍♂️ ❤ I will be always on his side
appreciate you and the life lessons you have taught me as a black man and a father

Yo Will how are u bro?

Omg ya'll the man is apologizing. It may not be the way or sound the way or look the way that ya'll approve of but he is doing it. Damned if you do damned if you don't in this world 🤦‍♀️
and don't forget about his Just Water :)
He should be reaching out offline if he was genuine, this is a fake politician like movement.
The background is amazing 🤍
Lemon ✊ CLM
well good they apologize but give him a hug and like some chocolate bars or something
Damn shame theres not an acurate description of how people even feel about this bullshit apology. You're a lucky dude (luckier) Career is still fucked, that the dislike buttons been removed lol.  Basing all the filtering of comments also, PR team has their work cut out. Goodluck, pretty heavy influx and we won't forget! :)  Would say goodluck, but you're still rich and miserable lol.
Guys stop throwing all that hate on the man. Have you never done something wrong in your life? You think that you are you a perfect being? My message to all you people who amplify the hate; chill the Fvck out, and try and realize all the good that he did in his life, and try and realize that he is just like any of us: trying to move in life.
No le pegues a la gente, gracias!!!

You gotta figure out a way through this without forgiveness from Chris. Forgive yourself and move on from this. Brainstorm and put it together, not all of us want to crucify you and Chris can't hear you.
CLM✊ WE STAND WITH YOU 🍋✊
Bro, you got so much heat as we had put you on a very high pedestal, anyways, learn, apologize and move on. Everyone makes mistakes, it's part of being a human.
This situation has turned out more humiliating for Will than Chris.
The heart of forgiveness is what we all need to carry with us.  Somethi8ngwe should all think about before we act. I am sure this doesn't matter to Will Smith but I have been praying for him and those involved as I know there had to be so much internal pain to lead someone to act in that manor. For what it is worth I believe ya and am still a fan.

Nah, too scripted !
We will with you Smith sir
just unsubscribed from your channel, you are not the man I thought you are. You are just a person with no spine, that's all.
FAKE    How did fresh Prince become FAKE ??  Bullish video
Will, released your movies to your fans only! Forget Hollywood!
You are human, you're not God, that's why we have Jesus.  Forgive yourself, trust your Heavenly Father to forgive you...because He loves you best. My prayers have been with you, both sides of this. Denzel told you right...anytime God elevates his children...the enemy is coming after you...I expect his attack on me for sending this message now. But...my God is greater !!!!!!!!!
I think people should try to remember the laughter and joy Will brought to millions for decades and not forget that while he is that person he’s also human. If you read his memoir and watched his videos you know he’s suffered a lot of trauma. I’m NOT excusing his behavior, just asking people to remember he’s human and had he not been a celebrity this would have gone very differently. Every day someone fights to defend those they love, it’s just that those people are fortunate enough not to be A list celebrities on tv where every error, lapse in judgment, and trauma are broadcast to every outlet around the world almost instantly. Will has spent his life making people happy and bringing joy and laughter to the world. He’s apologized, maybe it’s time to show him the grace we’d all hope for after we messed up…and we all mess up. Let he who is without sin…
We all mess up in life... some mistakes bigger than others... it happens... we learn and move on. Hopefully, Will, you can get back on track and that there is forgiveness. Don't give up. You are missed. Now go out there and love life again...
This is something straight out of The Boys - Will Smith is THE DEEP
Multiple camera angles for an apology video seems like an…interesting decision. But I can’t hate. A lot of this seemed genuine, albeit very slow and intentional (which to me does not take away from the sincerity). Will probably has so much weigh baring down on him, he’s probably just desperate to do the right thing and move forward. I’m not excusing his actions. I like what Dr. Todd Grandè had to say about the situation a lot. Find his video in the recommended.
YUCK
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Will Smith sucks. He's always going to be a P.O.S. You're done dude 🤷‍♂️ Just go away, Go Away.
Just be your "real self" and forgive yourself. You don't owe (fans) ANYTHING except to be the best (for yourself) at the talent/art you choose to express and  sharing the joy you find in expressing it.   Problems occur when you feel you need to be all things to all people; that's a trap for the soul. The folks that choose to judge/condemn you in this particular situation have probably done a crappy thing or two to somebody somehere down the line in their own lives.  So please get off your self-imposed pedestal/prison you' seem hell bent on creating for yourself. Yep, you msde a horrendous decision...WHO HAS'NT. at one time or another.Yes, you  humiliated yourself in one moment of time..big deal...  What about all the beautiful new moments ahead of you?  Life is too wonderful to allow youself to be trapped in unredeemable regret.  You've made your apologies...  NOW GET UP! PUT YOUR BIG BOY PANTS ON 😊 and  go have some fun creatively. I'm looking forward to seeing what the Most High will bring through you from this point forward.  🤗❤🙏👍
This is the most apology ever
I think you should read the ethics of beauty. You re always trying to find happiness outside your home. Buddiam Hinduism etc. But this are not your roots. You need beauty in your life again. When you have beauty truth and goodness will follow.  I can recommend the works of Dietrich von Hildebrand. Just keep in mind will.... There is a reason why truth in Christianity is not a fact but a person..
Praying for you Will. Your true fans know that event was out of character for you.  We know you will come back from this. We believe in you. YOU will be okay. We still love you.
Will Smith really needs that rewind time again
👎
Professional actor and miserable AF , Hollywood people huh.
There is an embedded kid in his adult body.
I hope you are doing well Sir, and healing through your struggles. I know there are a lot of negative comments here, but just know Im not going to be one of them. I am happy you exist, I hope you are ok, I hope you are alright, and know if you are not, I hope you will be.
An apology is only one half of consequence. The other half is taking action to make sure this doesn't happen again, by you or others.
Thank you for making this Will.  You are trying really hard. I see your genuineness. And it cleared up questions I had.  Thank you. I have nothing but respect for you and the way you have handled this.  May God bless you
Its a bit too late everyone is ashamed of you
Chris don't need an apology. Will one day you going to have to let him get his stuff off like Charlie Murphy 🤣🤣🤣  https://youtube.com/shorts/sn8xkRwevus?feature=share
In my eyes, Will Smith SUCKS! I’m sure he is working on a film or have something coming out, otherwise he wouldn’t be doing this disingenuous apology. Well, whatever is in the works, I won’t be watching.
Ok cool but how does this affect lebrons legacy?
Worst, pathetic apology I've ever witnessed.
Well, I’m placated. Wild, Wild West sequel, anyone?
love u will
Nope. Not even the FP re-runs!
Surprised this wasn't on Jada's facebook show
This apology sucks
I don’t normally comment on celebrity lives.  I just want to send you positive energy.  Not because of any difficulties you are currently experiencing but because of you grace in sharing your talent, life and energy all of these years.  You and your families’ work have been positive touch points for some of my most alive moments (no matter the type emotions of those moments). In my youth your songs were a positive jam for friends to vibe with and have good times.  As a young single parent your words to Tre became an anthem for me and my daughter.  I could go on an on.  I will say that that same light that you have withstood the heat of in order to add to our lives comes with a cost that I wish you didn’t have to endure.  Intrusive and intense is the gaze on you all.  I send you positive energy (my cousin in my mind).    Stay Blessed Fam’
Niggas in Paris is a good song
Will is one of the best entertainer in the world of show business. hope he can put joy to people as an artist and human being for the rest of his life.
I think you were not wrong there 😕😕😕
Just say Sorry! simple. This is all just a publicity stunt. We’re not fools Will…
We all need to remember we are human we make mistakes nobody is perfect it takes courage to apologize
I'm on your side
Doing anything and everything except divorcing that bald headed jezebel demon
Dude, Mike Tyson bit off Holyfield's ear. They doin commercials together now. It's just goning to take time, you can't fast forward that sht

Cool
Everybody makes mistakes in life even if it is big or small, every human being existing or existed or will exist. God didn't create human beings perfectly. Will Smith made a mistake and he's trying to apologise for it still there are so many people whose still hating him. But why?
im not gonna buy those products around him
Will Smith, you're not at fault. Don’t be disappointed.  All Koreans are rooting for you.
Still too soon to show your face again
This apology isn't good enough.
"Cant believe we lost Gilbert Saget and Will Smith in the same year! " Jeff Ross
Clearly see him looking down on a pre written piece of paper or screen. Just be real Will this is not. Bs. Nice plants and background. The way you pause for drama is obvious. Smh.
You're just making yourself look like the victim in that whole situation.
👍❤️
Love you man! Waiting for Bad boys 4
There is something definitely bothering him. 😒
Will is down bad
toxic relationship has toxic fruit over time
Just say I'm sorry straight to the person. I dont want all these media /social media bullshit.
Get my wife’s name out your mouth
Will I support you in what you are going through greentings i am your fan
Uncle Phil is unfortunately dead so he can't even do a fresh prince reboot to redeem himself 😪
His healing and his actions do not need to be explained to us. They need to be explained to those he hurt. We didn’t need this video.
my dad thought you were dead
You are a legend! We all make mistakes! Don’t let this be your downfall! Keep your head up and keep doing what your doing!
Watching Men in Black right now here man... you're a badass actor! Always your fan
the lightning... the camera shots... the product placement.... the pro sound setting... this is major-studio levels apology. I wonder what was the budget?
His careers Done

lol there's nothing complex to unpack, you were just a selfish prick, you undestood nothing.
Where’s his dog?
Keep your head up will tough times don't last
Go get help !
Nah
The only thing deader than my dog is the Is guy’s career 💀
If only we could still see the dislikes on videos 🤣🤣
We love you, Will! You're human. We all have made mistakes...some bigger than what you have done. No one can judge you!
F.U.
it still was super funny
Will is so luckily that he got that rewind button!
Damn that water bottle placement was just fabulous
this comment section is more interesting..
I could make a video 4x longer than this explaining how bad this apology video is.
One mistake doesn't demean all your victories, one mistake just shows how you are a human like us, we love you. kisses and hugs stay in peace.
Does anyone know how I can get a message to Will? I don't want a reply, just need him to know he changed my life for the better, I borrowed his confidence to get me though the hardest time, and he deserves to know. Thank you guys 🙂
Ok this was cringe to watch. If he said this whilst playing a character in a movie I would have believed him.
We make mistakes. Its okey Will.
Need a PewDiePie apology review on this
A normal person would take a night of thinking tops to come to the conclusion I fucked up and embarrassed myself and others,  to apologise to them and that's it.  Not do mental gymnastics to avoid feeling guilty or to blame. Embaressing
No matter what... I love u will smith
This guy hahah
You're better when you're happyyy
It’s ok we love you
She's dragged you into the gutter with her. Your better than this Will
Ratiod :o lol How one of your greatest idols and one of the only good-ish people in Hollywood just turns into the "Prince of Hot-Air", .... sad world we live in...
日本とアメリカでここまで文化が違うのか...。
You shouldn't have bullied Paul Rodriguez on the set of Ali.
We still love you Will.
I forgive you will👍👍👍
Maya Angelou once said, “nothing human can be alien to me”. I look up to the idea that if someone is capable of doing something as a human, they can also learn to understand those who do something they themselves have never done (or otherwise had happen to them) but could do (or have happen to them). I feel empathy for both sides. Let us not recreate in words more hurt.
Disliked it because theres no dog
Yaaaa
When Will goes directly up to Chris, and tells him directly that he’s genuinely sorry, I’ll respect him again. Not as much as before, but still respect him.
btw this video currently has 251k dislike
This is way too Hollywood wtf😂
@4:50 -5:44  “I am deeply remorseful, without tying to be shameful of myself “ …. But then when I hear that …. I don’t feel too comfortable… after all that’s been said then he ended with that makes me feel like the whole video doesn’t sound like a genuine apology anymore …he is not truly think he is wrong 😑
Why is it every time a famous person apologizes, everyone says its a fake apology?
Y’all stop hating.. he made a mistake.. it’s hard to get your reputation back from this.. even if it isn’t genuine, it takes guts to do this in front of 10 million people
I don't care what others say, this apology seems 100% genuine to me.
251k people have disliked the video over 112ks likes. Sucks to be you Will
You can really see his ego hurt alil everytime he says the word sorry
I'm happy to see you after so long man...the relief is huge
L
real ones still love and support you the same! since day 1. love u fresh prince
We all make mistakes in life. I hope everyone can be forgiving 🙏  at least he acknowledged it
Took this dude months to actually apologize.
You said it…”you’re human.” Anyone who says there hasn’t been a time in their life where they haven’t wanted to do something along the lines of what you did, would be lying. Yes, you should have kept your hands to yourself. However, you have the right to have emotions. No a#% kissing here, just stating the obvious. You made a poor decision in a moment. That one time doesn’t define who you are. ✌🏽
Sorry will, apologies doesn't accepted.
This feels like a parody of a youtube apology video.
You should have apologized
Will , we're all human . We make mistakes and what makes us better is learning from them .
CLM✊CLM✊CLM✊CLM✊CLM✊✊CLM✊CLM✊CLM✊CLM✊CLM✊
This ain't it.
I LOVE YOU,WILL!
Life happens, including this.  No one is perfect.
He has made a severe and continuous lapse in his judgement, and he does not expect to be forgiven. He is simply here to apologize.
Will has the best P.R. team in the world. With that being said, do you think his words are sincere. 🤔
This makes Logan Paul look good.
A mi me da igual, esto se olvidara en un futuro de todas formas
Yes, I was disappointed in what you did to Chris, but, I still love you Will! We all make mistakes. Imagine what our lives would look like if there was a camera to capture some of the worst moments of our lives.
This is the most insincere apology video i've seen. Nice PR stunt
I still love Will Smith
Way too little, way too late. Way too fake.
I'll bet he has a film coming out soon. Only reason I can think of that he'd wait 4 months to dial down the crazy.
Fake apology
It's funny because this is the first time he is being held accontable for a behavior like this
🤮🤮🤮scum
Mr Smith....in these times GOD is working through man(woman) that HIS GLORY/WILL.. be Done..Mr Chris knows why  it was done,..Mr Smith you  and all people are in the last days of REVELATION...as servants (2 servants) we are greatful to  know you.. You are a  Class act, and always was...if all men were given your heart, the world would not be in REVELATION...you must prepare yourself for the coming of The Lord..don't sweat the small stuff...most of those (people) you know WILL  become By words..we know this as fact...we(2 servants) are all up in it... AGAIN GOD Love's You...we,(2 servants) also Love you... peace be with you....... peacemakerservant1
I scrolled through atleast 50 comments and coud see none supporting this man.  Way to go bruh🙌
your good 👍
I literally thought tht this ws a response to Willow's Wait A Minute
wow Will. You did good. It takes a person to say sorry or apologize, but it takes a human to admit both. and its so unfair the cause is completely left out. we are judges because it wasn't us but im sure a lot of us could have made it worse. drink water son. forget the negatives and focus about the positives.
It's rewind time
BETA!
Probably the worst way possible to apologize
I really don’t blame him at all
Fake
I know it’s not the same thing but I wish Will and Michael Richards would have a chance to be in our lives again
With time to reflect on all of this and I haven't watched it yet, I think, Will, you've just been under so much pressure it just got unmanageable. I don't for a minute think that you're a bad person. I can't imagine your stress level and I think this world would do itself a great favor if we would stop judging one another so harshly about everything. If anything, this whole thing just shows us that you're human just like everyone else. You've put plenty of light into this world.
PR crap
R.I.P  Carrera De Will Smith
The comments, general public, and agents aren’t taking your side. What is your pr crew gonna do now?
Little late to the party but I respect you Will for acknowledging that you made a mistake and are willing to make things right once again
Bruh did he really do the youtuber apology sigh in the beginning??
I love you will. And we trust how good person you are.
This is possibly the most narcissistic and self indulgent "apology" in human history....
SHEEESSHHHHHH, BAD BOYS IN TOWN SHEEEEESH
How many dislikes so far?
I jumped right to 0:25 and thought "what a weird looking cap".
Will ur not perfect, I respect u brother ,but this great step for healing......we all make mistakes......God bless 🙏 💪 , showing love from EAST st Louis il
cringe
This is the most disingenuous apology I've heard/seen in a long while. Utterly disgraceful.
It wasn't a mistake
Is being ashamed not an actual part of a true apology?
Hmm, . . . Okay .
Yikes man
His performance in After Earth is somehow better than his performance in this apology video
Nothing will change what he did until he actually admits to himself how his actions affected others & this video dose nether he's not sorry nor is this even close to a apology & until he dose I think the whole world should just forget about him I know I have , if I see anything with will smith in it I'm just simply not watching it
No
Yaaaah, it's rewind time
Lessons and Learning... There's no absolutely failure.  Keep evolving will!
we still love ya dude don't worry about it
I've got your back, for life, dog. Just keep doing you bro. ❤️ Chad O.
What would carlton think? 🤣
A mistake? That’s a career defining moment that will not easily be forgotten—ever.
We all love you Will!!❤️🙏🏼
Keep my wife's name out your mouth
don't say sorry. You was right and the people are just dumb and hypocrites
Phony
If he just apologized when he got his award, then things would be a little different. Yes, he is human and when you're a celebrity people are less forgiving because the expectations are a little higher.  He has a long road ahead of him.
That's hot
My impression of you is that you're an actor. That's all it's ever been. Saying you're ready for Chris to talk to you is assuming he's going to ever want to talk to you. Why should he? He owes you nothing.
After reading the comments I see most people expect perfection, one f up and you’re done, either be perfect or we hate you. And if you come to realise your mistake and make an apology then better do it in a specific way or we hate you more…. Sad world we live in.
What he did was wrong, but he can't change the past, no one can, sometimes good people do bad things, I think he deserves the chance to make amends.
not very authentic...... sorry but not one of your best acting.... and wayyyyyyyy too late
Disgusting behaviour. You showed your true Color’s that night. Zero to rage in a heart beat. I was hoping the apology would be with Chris (when he is ready) before you bounced one out on social media. Still pushing brand smith I see. I for one was a life long fan but I will never watch you again. I have been bullied when I was younger and as an adult the dread and fear it would give me is immeasurable. You’re working on yourself? Try harder. No pr team. No scripted questions. Do an interview and answer the really hard questions. Oh and stop pushing your brand. No one wants to buy from a narcissistic bully.
Goodness me your human apology said should be over with. Godbless❤🙏🏼🙏🏼
"Keep your apology out your f•cking mouth!"
Will smithSocksfor1 is trying to beat you in subs!! beat socksfor1!!
wearing his own brand hat...wow...an apology. and product placement...James Charles could learn
Will you’ve been my favorite action actor through your rise, I loved you in ID4, you were amazing in the MiB series, I watched Seven Pounds just because you were in it and the movie was amazing because of how you poured your heart into it, and I Am Legend is my favorite movie, and you and Sam had to carry that entire movie and you reached perfection! I’m your fan forever and you’ve made my life better from your art! God bless you sir❤️
I do believe, like he said, that the movie he just did as the Williams dad did in fact put him in that mindset to where he would, like he said, want to protect and so that was his way to protect.  I think Chris should have just targeted someone else during his brief appearance. Kind of odd to keep picking on them.
❤️ apologising is good. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
nope will, today ain’t the day my friend
Will we forgiven you after the first apology ! Stay up stay strong
Will Smith is using his "apology" video to advertise his water brand "Just Water". He has a bottle on the table with the logo facing forward and he is wearing a branded hat.  That should tell you everything you need to know about this man. He couldn't even apologise without using it to cash in.  This is the most disgusting product placement I've ever seen. He has zero shame and there is zero sincerity in this or he wouldn't be using it to cash in. This family are the worst.
My heart was broken when this incident happened. Everybody who worked on a film set with Will said he’s the nicest person you could ever work with. an absolute friend to all who worked with him. What happened to you man? Who are you now?
Oh how I’d love to see the dislike ratio on this one.
You're a beautiful soul Will. Thanks for everything you've done so far. You inspire us. We love you. None of us are perfect. In the real world, we all make mistakes and in the real world, people DON'T apologize that often because of pride and ego. In the fake Hollywood world, most people pretend to be perfect or superior than anyone else, but we don't know what happens behind closed doors, when the mask is off. Please Will, don't let their misconception of you drag you down. I know this whole story will make you stronger and elevate your consciousness...Know your worth, Trust in God! And keep loving and doing Your thing. No one on this earth can do it better than you.
I believe every word out of his mouth.  All the respect to you.  I hope one mistake will not define you.
When you decide to be real and talk genuine, I'll be listening.
The fact that he needed a production team to make this apology proves it’s scripted and not genuine
If we see every apology as fake, then that means that no man is redeemable. People, we are all human. The difference between him and us is that our worst moments usually aren't seen by the whole world.
just leave her
this is what an abused husband looks like people
That was the greatest video in the history of television
He needs to make amends, not just apologize. Ask him what he can do to make it right, with no excuses.
Hollywood without Will is  Ollywod
Will is one of kings Hollywood
Uncle Phil is up in heaven looking down on you ... ashamed of what you have become.
yall mad
Huh
GET RID OF HER!
I'm not perfect either You're still amazing to me Still my favourite actor Sending Love and Strength from Tasmania Australia ❤️
You deserve all the hate. Крис комик, к его словам надо относиться с улыбкой а не с ударами по лицу!
why would you make this
Was a big fan same age as you grew up watching the show but for you to disrespect another comedian that I love put you at the bottom of my list. Especially when you say oh I'm so good because I don't cuss on my records. We are all real people when it comes down to it and I understand emotions and feelings come into it. But as a professional definitely a let down.
Come on Will,  you're not trying. This response is disappointing 🙄
247 thousand dislikes. Thats not good.
Everything will be ok Will. I hope you will recover from this traumatic situation.
"Apologizing.—A very desperate habit,—one that is rarely cured. Apology is only egotism wrong side out. Nine times out of ten, the first thing a man’s companion knows of his shortcoming is from his apology. It is mighty presumptuous on your part to suppose your small failures of so much consequence that you must make a talk about them." - Exerpt from 'The Writings of Oliver Wendell Holmes: The Professor at the Breakfast Table.'
Anybody else remember when Ricky gervais called everyone out for ignoring actresses getting harassed by weinstein and being in Epstein’s flight logs and wonder why that didn’t get nearly as much attention?
Chris is such a baby 😂😂😂😂😂
Sooo Fakeeee......
🤔🤔
this was about as insincere as I imagined it would be when I heard about it. he lost me real early with "I was fogged out". that's a cop out yo
A real mop, the guy, no dignity.
If only the dislikes weren’t removed 😂
I feel this apology is sincere. He apologized to Chris, to Chris's mother, to his friends, and to his family and I can tell he would love it if Chris and he could talk this out but he has to respect Chris's need for space. Will has learned how to distinguish remorse from self-hatred. He's very clear in saying I apologize but I'm not going to receive the idea that I'm worthless. He's still a good guy with a good heart.
Wtf do you guys want from him. He’s trying to move forward and apologize. Everyone makes mistakes. Half of you guys in the comments probably don’t even have the balls to apologize for your mistakes. Move on guys if you don’t like him don’t watch him🤷‍♂️simple as that
"okay guys i said it, now please stop aiming that gun at me"
Ignore the hate Will. Youve done way more good in your life than bad. You arent defined by your worst moment. We've all done bad things. Not that I matter, but if youre sincere in your apology, i forgive you. Love from a fan x
This is cringe. 😬
CLM 🍋✊
🤡
I love where he spoke of working through his regret and remorse and the pain he caused not only the ppl involved but those of us that love his work or have children that love his work. We are all human and make mistakes, what is important is recognizing them and making amends to those we may have hurt. God bless him for progress he's made, and we are friends again! ☺️🤭😉
I don’t feel like Will owes anyone an apology. If this was a rapper y’all would be laughing n giving him props n justifying it. Ppl love to share drama n fights on social media but now y’all want to crucify Will Smith for this. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️
We Love You Endlessly Will Smith ❤️
Still love you Will! This is big.
There is a huge difference between saying, “I’d like to apologise“ and, “I apologise.” Also, as someone said below, there is also a huge difference between saying “I apologise” and I’m sorry.”  This should not have taken three HOURS never mind three MONTHS.  This guy is till wrapped up in his ego if he thinks that making a flashy video is an okay way of doing this.
Just take this video down Will. This is not genuine at all
This is just.. No..
Will did the right thing. He doesn’t need to apologise to anyone.
I accept his apology😢 looking forward to your future work.

yaaaa its rewind time
Why are you apologising. It was your best work. It was better than the fresh Prince. This turtle crawl back into your shell is cringey.   Also. the studio sucks. Everything is over designed. You didnt have an animal beside you either, so you can show people you are human.    You should have instead gone full Shia Lebouf. Wear a paper bag and let people tell you how much they hate you, without fear. because your hands will be tied.
Will Smith has always been so fake.
Its*
I really enjoyed your show and movies. I bought into the positivity that you sold.  But now I cant bring myself to watch, its like Cosby amd his shows that are tarnished by his persona.    This apology is so carefuly crafted it lost the meaning behind the message.  Sad.
Doesn't seem genuine at all, he use to be my fav actor after i watched i am legend as a kid, really sad to see him becoming this.
See this is what happens to you after you get super famous and will has been in the industry for god knows how long and along the way he forgot the ways to make a simple apology
ياخ لي تعتذر هو يستاهل كفين 😭
You should not be sorry even though is a fake sorry 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
2LIL2LATE 🙃
i don't know you personally mr smith but.. i enjoy your movies. i grew up in nyc in the 90s and have enjoyed all entertainment you have given to me growing up. i wanted to just send you some love, power , and reinforcement that you still have a fan in me. i will continue enjoying the entertainment you provide and watch all the will smith stuff. i hope the power i send to you strengthens you as you conquer this issue with how you currently being perceived in the media right now!
Fake
A beautiful and true apology that none of the herd here writing horrible comments could ever made. Will is human like all of you and like me. Stop treating celebrities like gods that can't make mistakes. The important thing is to apologise afterwards, to stand up after you fall. And Will has demonstrated here that he is a very decent, human, and growing man. All our love & respect to you, Will. Also to your family. Many greetings from Spain.
You literally said you’re not ashamed of yourself. If there’s ANY thing in life to be ashamed of, it’s ALL of your actions IN AND AFTER that moment. You doubled down and stayed there. You gave a whole narcissistic speech. You went on to dance and party. BE ASHAMED. Did your mamma not raise you right!? Not the “optimal” way to handle it lmao. GTFOH with this trash insincere “apology” and find another therapist to deal with your “central trauma”
We all make some Mistakes in life! It’s ok being wrong.. and it’s awesome coming and saying sorry to those we have hurt! We have to learn from our mistakes. ♥️
The whole video felt like he was reading a well rehearsed script.
I cant even watch this guys movies anymore. Pretty sad
As a celebrity we are expecting the most but they’re people, you failed us because we are people.. you just expected to be the best of us.
I have been afraid of heights my entire life and listening to this gave me the courage to go skydiving without a parachute! Thank you Will Smith <3
I like when Will Smith said "It's Apologizing Time!"
I forgive you Will.
Fake apology, watching it back,  it's not so much the smack that's the issue... yes you got angry heated and jumped up to smack him that's terrible and he should press charges regardless of an "apology".... but then when you sat down shouting "keep my wifes name out you f***ing mouth" repeatedly" after the smack, you could see chris looked scared, shook up didn't know really what to do but handled it like a boss, you on the other hand, urgh,
Damn his personality does not fit this situation AT ALL. “Nahhh ahaha, that was my choice” Jesus Will…talk about multiple strike outs with how you’ve handled this.
This apology is worth as much as his wife's loyalty.
To everyone who thinks Will shouldn’t have done this video, then what do you want him to do? How do you want Will to do this? I understand why some people may find this video disingenuous and see this as the typical bad youtuber apology video.
How to make the fakset video/apology if you think someone desverd something
I would rather watch the Logan Paul apology video for the millionth time
Man look, I hope you just get away from that woman. Seeing your career in movies and outside of that dwindle because of her, it’s heartbreaking. You were and still are someone I’ve looked up too since I was a kid, in all honesty I probably would have done the same thing, just not on that stage. But seeing how negatively people reacted (rightfully so) to someone who’s always been the cool laid back funny guy everyone loves to be around. Sucks. I hope you take a page out of Johnny’s book in a few years and divorce her finally, even if it’s hard on the kids. I think they’re old enough to understand by now and be okay with it. A lot older then I was.   I don’t like saying what people should do, but you can clearly see the damage it’s causing him mentally and emotionally inside and has broken him down over the years man. Enough’s enough. She wasn’t worth that. And that’s okay to say man. She isn’t worth ruining yourself for.
This was awful
Basically Will should stop saying I apologise and say.. 'I'm SORRY'
#CLM ✊️
LMAO what is that description.
My guy it’s been 4 months, just let it go.
This is the greatest YouTuber apology video that is not made by a YouTuber
Aahhh the classic YouTube apology sigh at the beginning of the vid
He had to do this for business.
This is so inauthentic. Sad. I don’t believe you feel bad but I hope you actually do.
Sounds like a repeat offender’s parole hearing. No remorse whatsoever, completely scripted, and without merit.   Just empty words, strategically planned in an effort to escape the reality you are mentally incapable of understanding.
Love you Will, people don't know how hard these moments are until they are passing through it
3.5m views, that’s 70K in YouTube revenue… when you are famous you make money off apology video 🫡
great acting
You've let me down, you've let the squad down... Frankly, you've let yourself down.  This 4 months later Youtube apology nonsense is really very unbecoming of you Will, the only honourable thing for you to do is to resign.
🐐
As long he is with Jadah and really fix things with Chris,  this man will never gain my respect ever again.
glad to see you back will most of us forgive you
تو الناس تأخرت يالغالي😤ياخي تقهررر🤬 الي منقهر. منه يصف جنبي🤬🤬
Move on. Best you can do
He was so fogged up at the after party as well. He was having a BLAST!
He’s sorry. He’s paid a huge price. No one is perfect. I still think he’s a good guy. What he did was not right and yeah, he sometimes acts a little entitled but he’s still a very talented, handsome, good-natured guy and shouldn’t be thrown away just because of one poor choice.
I would happily watch Morbius 5 times again insteed of this video ever again
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Still that kid that loved seeing you on the fresh prince of bel-air before going to school. It is a pity that as a celebrity you are constantly on watch and not allowed to make any mistakes. We do the same mistakes as you on a daily basis, way worse most of the time but here you are being hanged for a mistake that thousands of humans have done in the last 24hours.   Hope you find it in yourself to forgive yourself as well. This is life and we are all learning and growing. One love uncle willard.
How many people were in the PR team that made those questions?
I nearly didnt throw up
In a fog is an understatement.  What a jerk. Starts every sentence with "I". Classic egomaniac.
What a woke apology :(
this dude...
I understand the human mistake as a way of see our live in this planet. All of the history of this race, human race, is full of men and women making mistakes. I accept Will's apologyze, he is a human being too.
This guy will really acts innocent
Get outta YouTube we don't need you I think it's rewind time
Will, your apology is authentic and self-reflective. What’s missing is for you to reflect on the impact your actions had on Chris and acknowledge that impact to him. Without that piece, it just sounds like words. He needs to know that you have reflected on his perspective fully. Then you can begin to repair the harm. This is a good start, but not quite there yet. Sending you blessings. I know this has been a very difficult time for you and just remember that going through this will make you an even bigger person than you already are. ❤️

Wish I could see the dislike counter
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
We all just human nobody's perfect
I'll be completely honest and true 1 man that has such a huge online presents that did this bad was Logan Paul man did so much stupid stuff like its not even funny but now he has truly changed his life around and has got more fame and fortune from it I think he show just Dm him because this just feels like something for to get off his chest and not an apology
I wish to you the best will  You are my legend i love you from my heart 💖
From Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Thug of Bel-Air.
Is this a YouTube apology video like Logan Paul, James Charles, Tanna, and etc
Growing up will smith was my absolute favorite actor. When i was a kid movies like I am legend, Independence Day, Hancock, I robot, and even pursuit of happiness were incredible. The fresh prince is also super nostalgic. I guess he finally lived long enough to see himself become the villain.
“I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement”
I’m still a fan!
hey man i think you did great i mean you might be a celebrity but human none the less. Keep doing the right thing. I truthfully do believe we are all allowed a mistake or two in life that does not absolutely destroy everything. You are still one of my favorite actors!
This is one of the apology videos of all time.
Current Like/Dislike ratio: 111,132 / 243,543  💀💀💀
It never fails to amaze me why people still do these obviously highly controlled, fake apologies. You could be real and have a heart to heart with people and be held accountable and people will come around to forgive you. But these apologies these days don’t mean anything and everyone knows it. If you’re not sorry don’t say it. At least be honest
i love how he's apologizing to everyone but the person he needs to 💀. the only reason he's apologizing is because of the impact it had on his career, not because he accepted what he did was wrong & actually regrets what he did. it's even funnier considering he went from this chill, funny guy to this. also, why was it necessary to get this whole setup & camera crew for something that could've been recorded on your phone? if you're gonna make an "apology" this dramatic, at least do it right 💀.
You should be very ashamed, Jada's boyfriend wouldn't approve
Yo, Christ, donnez-moi un break. Macron can forgive Biden for a huge submarine deal, you can also forgive Will. Peace.
What's the purpose of this (scripted) video? Does he have a movie coming up?   Just how low can one go!? (sigh)  #sadsight
Se te pasó el tren smith…
Will diverted Jada's backlash.. WOAH!!!
That was deep and I hope we can all learn and move on from this!
What's wrong with being ashamed of yourself?  Yes, we're human which means we do dumb stuff.   Some actions we SHOULD be ashamed of.  They teach us that our actions have consequences and repercussions that extend far beyond what we can imagine at the time.  Being "ashamed" is embarrassed. That sounds like a conscious has been pricked.  Like there are defineable right and wrong actions.  That's a good thing. Excusing our poor behavior for being human doesn't make us less accountable.
What's up with the Wario hat
Y'all should heal and move ON, Will Smith should get help though and let's not over push the dude he might snap to a no return place. Will deserves a second chance just like anybody else.
half of you will probably tweet condolences when he offs himself in a few yrs. The internets insane man.
Jesus Christ guys he's sorry wtf is all this vitriol. Like any of yall are better.
Leave her....join the dark side Will.....let the hate flow through you
When Will said "It's apologizin' time" I cried tears of joy. Morbius would be proud.
Will Smith forever an opp, L Apology
Should’ve brought in a dog, makes everything better
LOL 🤣
I bet Chris's mom was like: "That's right Will, whoop his a$$!"
Nice hat, homie.
Lol this guy is fake as hell, doesn't look like he was actually sincere and genuine to what he was saying. His an actor for a reason
Should of called it "Let's be Frank..." lol
"The bad choices we make do not define us."
Will, You are not sincere bro :v  you said sorry to all people but Chris,  "I'm sorry" is an apology that expresses remorse, regret or embarrassment... It is used to apologize for something bad that u did to someone. other hand  " I apologize" is used as a statement of regret, although it is always seen as less sincere. than "I'm sorry" but yeah whatever , we all have that damn strong EGO :3
I adore you Will. You're only human and you're an amazing human, regardless of what mistakes you make. Show me a person who hasn't fucked up please... and I'll write my words on paper and eat it.
Will acted in the moment and made a decision that has affected his and his family's lives.  I truly believe he is remorseful and if he had it to do over again, that he would choose differently.  So what does that make him? HUMAN.  It's not easy living out the most personal aspects of your life in front of millions of people daily.  I commend him for taking responsibility and love him no less.  I'm awaiting his comeback and praying for his healing as well as Chris.'  Will Smith fan forever right here!!!!!
“All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride.” ~ Sophocles
He’s not sorry
I'd give it a couple of years and meanwhile, use your wealth and time to help those really in need....p.s. Divorce would be a good start.
Jesus Christ will wash him of all the shame he has and redeem him. Find Jesus Christ. He will open the door and redeem you and you can leave the  demonic world of Hollywood behind you, and everyone's opinion of you will no longer matter, because you will find the only thing that ever matters in this Life. The Lord Jesus Christ.
Yeah, he was still foggy when dancing straight afterwards. This video has only been created because the stigma hasn't gone away and his career has truly fallen. Sure he'll start to do tv interviews next to smooth things over. Really liked most of the movies he did until I saw the real unhinged and nasty side meaning his likeability now amounts to zero. Shame, but only an actor...there are plenty others.
its almost like you can tell jadas behind the camera giving him the stare. gotta leave her bro she aint good for u
L
Oh we’re re-milking this are we
Fresh prince of nothin no more😂😂🗑🗑
We still love ya bro..We also love Chris..I know its hard to uphold an image of yourself that ppl love and not be looked at as a human being in some instances..You made a mistake as everybody does sometimes and just like everybody does youll get through it..I just hope Chris will understand and forgive you as well..Peace n Love my Brother
the illuminati go to him
Man these celebrities are so removed from reality it's mind boggling lol. They really do live in their own fabricated worlds.
i was a fan you could say, your performances in i am legend and the pursuit of happyness, or the slightly funnier, cooler roles in hancock or bad boys, mib. starting with the prince. amazing what a career, what a talent, what a genius. you also traumatized me as a fan that evening, in a moment of weakness that should never have happened to you as a professional. some mistakes are unforgivable. I wish you all the best for the future, but unfortunately I can no longer support you. and i think it's time to step out of the public eye.
B L M 👋🏼 ?
والله يا انكم مكبرين الموضوع
Why can't these videos just be 30 seconds long. Simply say "I'm sorry Chris"
If you have a chance to visit india. Can you came to  india one time
Mr Will Smith I grew up mentored developed through made aware of society through knowing how you got to move in this world shaped and molded through TV shows and movies and still having the psychological awareness to know the difference between right and wrong reality and fiction but we all make mistakes and after all the good you done in this world you definitely deserve a second chance cuz we all do that's life we got to forgive each other and keep moving on being more God like
I loved the part were will said it’s smithing time and smithed us into tears with this beautiful apology
Uh

The point of a roast is to make you fit into the human crowd full of its own problems.  We should be able to withstand our flaws around others. If we can't then we are insecure, and we are showing that insecurity to the world. It's an act of embracing the flaws when we take the roast lightly.
this is the story of how wills life was turned upside down.
“It’s been a minute” *Its been four months-*
Why apologize to Tony Hawk?
Bro you need to apologise to your own mother forget Chris's mother
Standing with you, Uncle Will. ❤️❤️❤️

The funny thing about apologies: it’s being ashamed of yourself and your actions, humbling yourself to the person that you hurt, admitting your mistake, saying that you’re sorry, asking for forgiveness. The moment you add an excuse, it’s no longer an apology. And if you’re trying not to be ashamed of yourself and your actions, then you’re really not sorry.  That being said, there is grace and forgiveness, even when someone doesn’t apologize. But, like I tell my kids, trust needs to be earned.
He was caught in a ni ggah moment. -Boondocks 🤣

No biggie man. We moved on. You move on
Will Smith seems so broken man...
we all make mistakes had plenty of friends do dumb stuff but then apologize and thats the end of that shook it off. but unfortunately we live in a world that feeds off drama so unfortunately dought you will come back from this but hey get those on the big jobs 🙏😅
Can we get a Dragon Quest X official English translation? Thanx y’all

These people will say anything to remind him of his past. Imagine everyone saying he should apologise, then when he does they say he’s acting smh
Ok
Well hey a lot of celebrities have done so much more and worse and had been forgiven. So people will get over it and move forward. We're human and we make mistakes. Thing is we know you and you don't know us regulars. So I mean life goes on and people will soon forget. I hope you bounce back from this and will be able to move forward in your career. 🤗
Will... Will...Will  suggestion, commit to 90 days living in the wilderness with only what you can carry,  no ties to the outside world,  what you will gain from accomplishing the task 'no amount of money or fame could change how you see the world after that, you feel reborn
No
Не понимаю, для чего вообще извиняться, Уилл поступил так, как должен был поступить любой муж, отец, мужчина. Я считаю, что со стороны Смита это очень мягкая реакция. Непонятно, почему никто не осуждает Криса, видимо Американцы привыкли быть настолько толерантными ко всему, что забыли, что такое защита чести своей семьи, своего мужского достоинства. Если бы подобный клоун что то сказал бы на мероприятии такого высокого уровня в России, его бы уже пинало половина зрителей. P.S. Мужик, ты все правильно сделал, не за что тут извиняться, если бы ты этого не сделал, то как после этого жить.
The second you make an apology public, you have lost the plot. It’s crazy how celebrities think this is a good idea
in the words of one republic...its to late to apologise
Can you also apologise for Wild Wild West, please.
This is some of the best acting I’ve seen
Man, this proves that money doesn’t equal happiness. In this case, it’s created a sphere with a mirrored surface which Will Smith exists in. He is trapped in a very expensive bubble of despair, shame, and depression. I’m sorry Will.
L will
ratio
It’s ok we all make mistakes
SMH. He don't deserve a response.
What does Will have to say about Jaden's celebratory post "And That's How We Do It"?
This is the most apology video ever
"Keep my apology out of your f**king comments"
Everyone point at him and laugh
Nah my dude, you don't get to mess up that bad and come back with this lmfao. Looks like he's been taking acting advice from his son
Will,a REAL apology would be you calling Chris and do it one on one with no other intentions,this just feels like you trying to save your movie career instead of being truly sorry.
It was a cry for help sounds like you’re still in denial. Get out of your toxic relationship man you’re not a failure but it’s time to step up for you instead of destructing
four month of training and this is what you came up with ??? disappointed
will smith will  be the  lead actor in the next tarantino. all in!
We are not perfect people. God only perfect.  Will, continue to work on yourself and be true to yourself because this too shall pass.
TE AMO PRA CARALHO
This is the perfect example of a beta male. A rich and famous beta male, yet a beta male
his acting was better than spider-mans intro to the spider-man movie
It's a shame... Will is so talented yet he let a narcissist jeopardize everything for him.
Hi, Been watching you since Kid N Play. Unfortunately, I will never put eyes on your content again. Nothing from the past and nothing from the future.   Good luck.
Its wild how one action can ruin someones whole career.
PraYing for u brotha
If you look really hard, you can see Jada's reflection on Will's eyes making sure he says that she didn't tell him to do anything.
The sigh at the start has to be the most cliche thing in an apology video going. And for me it's a telltale sign that this apology is completely contrived.
I have no room to judge anybody else.  I’ll just say maybe he needs to fix whatever part of his life that made him feel he needed to do what he did because it honestly wasn’t that deep.
the pain in his voice.. it's so heartbreaking..     now that's acting.
CLM IS A LIFESTYLE #EROBBSTANDSWITHYOU
It's ok ☺️☺️🌹🌹
I am Legend is still pretty good tho
He’s a great actor and knows how to do a “YouTube apology”. Hey! It’s better than Laura Lee YouTube apology videos.
I respect you so much Will, but need to focus on yourself. If that means being single and alone for awhile. Maybe some self reflection is in order.
Why he sounds so robotic? Honestly I'm really sure that he is reading something.
Did Jabba the Hutt made you do it?
3:09 lol
I don’t know he probably just feels really bad and ashamed and just wanted to apologize before it got worse on how people feel about the situation because the longer it takes to apologize the worse it can be but also to early isn’t right either and with the way the internet works it would be longer to get out of peoples mind so he’s probably just taking his time so it doesn’t make it worse
Just dm him on Twitter lol
No part of me that thought that's the right way to behave....... Apart from the part of him that actually decided it was and carried it out.
He looks like he's smirking and trying not to laugh for most of this. Also feeble apology to Chris then spends most of it apologising to his family then talking about himself. This is brilliant stuff to study. Very interesting.
I was listening to love songs and YouTube recommended this. Not sure of the relation.
Thanks for ruining the stand up comedy scene
This is just about the worst "apology" ever.
Lol...my "central trauma" is this video.  Now you owe YouTube an apology for posting this crap.
Mr.Will Smith please give yourself a second chance ...u r a great personality so its ok its all ok we all still love you...we all are waiting now for ur next movie
He used to be my favorite actor and comedian but since that day no more can't even watch my favorite movies I am legend or ID4 or Bad Boys
"How fake do you want this to be?" The lion in his closet: Woof
What did the five fingers say to the face?
Bro goblin barrel is such an op card
cope
I don't think he's sorry for what he did, I think he's sorry for the consequences. He's sorry that people don't approve of him right now, and that genuinely hurts him. So he's sorry that he did something the general public thinks is bad, but he's not sorry for doing it.. "protecting his family" I also think he is sorry for ruining the night, because all the actors in the room, his friends, are looking down on him.

ITS REWIND TIME
I am a working-class citizen with three degrees, including a degree in psychology. I work hard to establish a voice for change – yet I have no platform to share meaningful views about colour, transformation, disgrace, or vindication….. Yet you, an actor, for some reason do have access to THE stage: yet you elect (in this highly rehearsed video) to defend yourself –again, and again, and yet again.  How wasted is the time at your behest….
No matter what, Will Smith is still the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air!
Why does everything  have to be scripted with this man? Just get your phone out and record a video bro
The “it’s rewind time” man has fallen in tough times.
1:01 HIS HAND MOVEMENTS SHOW THAT HES NOT GENUINELY SORRY AT ALL... WHAT AN A$$
The Skeletons card is unlocked from the Bone Pit (Arena 2). It spawns three fast, single-target, melee Skeletons with very low hitpoints and damage. They are the same as those spawned by the Witch, Tombstone, Skeleton Barrel, Skeleton Army, Graveyard, and the Skeleton King. A Skeletons card costs 1 Elixir to deploy.
Is he acting right now?
Just let behind that..
It's good for me..
Nice try G.I.  Not buying that load for 1 single second.  Be glad you're worth 350 million and go on to the house.
If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you
the first mistake you made was setting up this big quality video to apologise, with different camera angles like we are watching a car review. you sat with your phone out having a heart to heart wouldve looked more genuine
🗿
Wake up...Will is a human being just like everyone else. We make mistakes. So do people in Hollywood...stop holding them up on a pedestal. At the end of the day they are just human like you and me....
This dude went from one of the more likable celebrities to this
will this affect lebrons legacy
Actually, there was a huge part of you that thought it was okay to handle the incident that way because you did it.    Shameful.
At the end of the day it was just a public mistake, he doesn't have to hate himself
You thought that a body has to be perfect. That's why you did that...  You still be a person that I truly love.  You WILL always be a pure source of inspiration.
Go away
He should have started his speech off by saying I'm sure most of you all thought i was either very smart or incredibly stupid.
Rip bozo
ayooo this video has 110K likes to 234K dislikes 😂😂
This is awful. The apology. The apology is awful.
This is like that one scene in that movie, so relatable. Absolutely morbening.
Don't worry, Will! 🙌❤
It's already happened bro. Think before you act
He said “I am trying to remorseful without being ashamed of myself”.. How is that even possible after what you did?  Yes you are a human but you should be ashamed of yourself before you can move on and become more genuine in your apologies.
Never say sorry, people will put you down one way or another.
Well....at least the comments aren't disabled.....yet
Still love you Will
She’s your problem. Until you get rid of her, you will continue to be miserable.
We love you Will, sending healing energy!
There are 2 things* not There's 2 things
WTF were you thinking when you did it??? I will not forgive you!
“I want to apologise” is not actually saying SORRY !   It’s just a word to alert the listener that a sorry is coming, letting the person know that what you are about to say is going to be in their favour but an actual ‘I Am SORRY’ has to follow after the “I want to apologise” 🙄
She doesn't deserve you man...  Feeling mixed up because of her condition and expect you to act like her bodyguard on your own successful. But didn't grateful after you show her an attention and still ignore all your sacrifice.  Imagine protecting someone's back after she looked up to you disappointedly like "you suppose to protect ME" then she says I never asked you yo do that after you got something you don't deserve  I'm sorry for my bad english. I'm not an English speaker But please educate me if i made a mistake Either on my translation or my response
ISLAPPEDCHRISROCK, This video has changed my life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way ever again. This video represents emotions most humans could never comprehend. But I can. Thanks to this video I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. Thank you.
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
He is avery arrogant person this is not a valid argument if you are telling the truth you should speak in front of the public to apologise you must face to face to meet  this is serious ✍🤏
110K upvotes and 234K dislikes... GOOD.
Nineeee
A well orchestrated unapologetic apology. 🙄 This is what you get when your ratings plummet and you are desperate.  A little too late, Will…  On the other hand, we should never put all our faith in someone in Hollywood, especially actors that lie for a living. You never see the “real” them, you see what it takes to get them there…period. 🙄 Chris should have apologized too. They are both at fault. 🤬
The better question is when is the next bad boys coming out?
I am sorry Uh oh my circuits are broken
This is one of those apology video you take notes on what not to do
This is rivaling Travis Scott's apology
This apology is about as genuine as Jadas wedding vows
"You can't defend your wife's honor if she has no honor to begin with"
Boy, really missing that dislike button right about now.
I'm here whenever YOU'RE ready to talk. What?
Yikes....
How can he have remorse without shame? It’s like feeling regret without sadness.

Hey Will. I honestly hope you aren't reading these comments yourself,  but that someone screening them for you. (Celebrities should never read the comments for mental health sake), but if you do happen to see this one. I wanted to say I'm still your fan and I appreciate the public apology. You've always been a actor people (myself included) admire and this is real role model stuff. I hope amends are made and the bitterness over the situation fades...and I get to see your regular fun YouTube videos again soon. In the meantime,  remember that you have fans like me who still support you even when you mistakes like us regular humans. Good luck. I am rooting for you!
I know you’ll be able to recover and bounce back stronger than ever.

One of the apology’s videos of All TIME
You're forgiven. Most people is this world need to apologize like this. You'll be fine and better.
One time will messed up and everyone is kicking him while he’s down
Likes: 110k Dislikes: 233k
How can all of you sit there and think that you know this man at all? Let it be. Christ. You people judging Will like this is so beyond pathetic. Look at yourselves. Picture in your minds your worst moments in your life and now imagine the whole world saw?
lmao dude reads at a 2nd grade level.
Why did guys  copy that movie from the 90s? What’s the cover up?
All the broke boy haters in the comments is crazy 🤣
110K likes 233K dislikes. I just wonder, what kind of person likes this video?
I hope Chris stops bullying. Because thats really haram. What will He say to God? You are a great person you do not need to satisfy his toxic audience  -From iraq(:
It’s a long winding road back but I’m sure you are strong enough to make it.
Jesus, some of you commenters are freaking jaded! What's with the obsession with tearing people down today? Give the guy a break, can you imagine how embarrassing this whole situation was and  how guilty you'd feel? I've done my share of acting without thinking but at least I didn't have to see it on the news afterward.   I say good for you, Mr. Smith. It's not easy to apologize like that, especially online where people are their ugliest.  In the big picture, it's a little thing. Well done, sir.
You're all being so disgustingly awful. Chill. He apologised. You don't know what went on behind the scenes and between him and Chris. Go do something with your lives man.
I lost a lot of respect for this Man before the “apology” and now I’m losing even more, This was a publicity stunt not sincere at all.  And why do it publicly?!!!?
Fake and shallow. A despicable Narc.
I want you two to get in a movie together
We love you Will❤️❤️❤️
It's gonna be a cool 10 years or so before people come back around and feel nostalgic toward the Fresh Prince of Bel Air again and forget this
No Will… Your sorry your ego got in the way and now your paying for it  You lost a fan here, you couldn’t wait an hour or two to address it directly? Instead you stood up and walked  on stage while millions watched???  Something is wrong, you should fix it and move forward as we all need to move forward but I am not your fan
im sorry chris is… standing in front of his house and asking for forgiveness everyday… id watch every Live try… day 365 chris comes out… like a truman show
This dude needed a whole production set to do something he could have done with his phone camera sitted by the side of the road.

How ingenuine this is.  who produced this? You need to quit lying Smith.
Dude made a big mistake, but the only reason we are so mad at him is because we love him. Read psychanalaysis and then you' ll know what i mean.
I just ate two ham and cheese sandwiches for supper. Supper is what I call my evening meals, I know some people use other names for that, I like to call it supper. Tomorrow is Sunday so as usual I'm gonna have a hardboiled egg and four slices of bacon on toast for breakfast. How about you?
And that's how kids you don't apologise
Michael Richards used those same words, "personal work". His career never recovered.
Say what you want about Will Smith, in my eyes he is a true hero for doing this. He knew after all this time the memes would eventually fade. But here he is, bravely stepping back into the spotlight to give us more memes yet again, thank you Will, thank you!!
There was better acting in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
We are human - and I’m so glad many of your fans remember that & stand beside you. Grace & growth exist for every single one of us. 🤍🤍🤍✨
Will, if this was an episode of Fresh Prince you'd be the villain and Uncle Phil would have to give him a good roughing up to set him straight. Be like Uncle Phil, Will.
All this I apologize to you Chris but when he talks to his family he is sorry, such a fake video, he should be ashamed of making this crap, and he won best actor? Can't tell from this video
When someone does something wrong don't forget all the things they did right, sometimes good people make mistakes it doesn't mean we are bad it means we are human. I still love ya m8💙
Will Smith is correct , He apologies criss 🙏
"Why didn't i apologise in my acceptance speech" I was too self absorbed to realise what i did was wrong until I was told  and witnessed the backlash, is the honest answer. Surrounded by yes men for so many years i can imagine it's easy to get a warped perspective of self. Still though. Even now he seems disingenuous. It might do him good to take some time off and reevaluate and humble himself a bit, because it seems like he is still looking for a quick fix for something that runs a lot deeper than a couple of months can fix, he needs years. He lives in a world of his own fabrication. It's time to start rebuilding from the ground up. You need to break the toxic cycle you reinforced for all those years. He is not well at all.
Here’s a translation:  Will: I am so sad and remorseful that my image is now tarnished and I’d like you to start liking me again.
(DISLIKE BUTTON)
I have lost all respect for you. What were you thinking?
Me encantas Will, para mi eres el ejemplo de persona a la que me gusta seguir. Posiblemente no fue la forma óptima de reaccionar pero entiendo que te afectaron sus palabras en lo mas profundo de tu ser y no hay nada que te haga sentir mas dolor que insulten o bromeen con algo que afecta a tu familia. Gracias por ser como eres y adoro totalmente tu forma de ser y sentir. Besos y abrazos desde España
Nigga, you still around?
"it's all fuzzy" excuses excuses excuses
And still you grovel for Jada's good graces. Sad.
When Will smacked Chris, he smacked us all. Everyone who looked/looks up to him. Nobody is perfect, not even Will. Actions matter, especially when everyone can see you. I just never saw the man as a bully until that day. Hopefully, that is not who he really is. Props to Will for taking responsibility.
I love u will!! U will always be my childhood hero!! We all make mistakes and i did this kind of mistake, too, just like you. I know u had a ruff time, stress, a ruff childhood i understand why it happened 💚💜💚💜💚💜💚💜 I wish u all the best for u and Chris ur family. All the people who have a hard time.  I believe you 💜💚🧡💙  Greetings from Germany
🤮
I sided with will smith though all of this
Throw the gloves on with one of the brothers and call it EVEN
Thanx you
man i wish we could see the dislikes🤣🤣
I wonder how many memes are gonna be made of this
Why are yall hatin ? 💀
I’m definitely in an alternate reality 😂
Clinical study of An Apology by someone who’s never learned, never though they’d have too. The P.R. crew had to come up with something
,CLM
This all seemed very staged and not real. No emotion in his delivery just reading of the script.
Will is so lucky to have Jada's boyfriends as the camera crew.
Fack of Man ur done...period....period....
You should have spent the last three month in filing a divorce.
Sometimes you got to choose. Impress your woman for the wrong reason or own your mistake instead of trying to own an already lost situation. I feel bad for this man. He has  neutered himself mentally for a woman he should have left a long time ago.
Guys how to download tlauncher pls helpp :(((
i love the part when he say ''uh'', ''umm'', ''and'' 90 times. it broke my heart 💔
I'm done with this guy I can't deal with fake charade this is the real if you were really sorry u would quit and fade into obscurity and spare us this nonsense
And you understand this because you really put some thought behind it. Or is your wallet been affected ? And this is the best thing you can do to help your wallet ?
some people really have lost it. “4 months late buddy, he didn’t even apologize to chris.” Did you even remember that it was four months ago? He made this video on his own after making REAL CHANGE. he apologized to chris. he will most likely tell him directly more words when he can reach him directly. You are not a will smith fan if you can let a man be sorry without nitpicking every damn word and phrase.
Will - do better. A LOT BETTER THAN THIS CRAP. Chris - hope you had a great time in Croatia. We loved having you!
When you think you know everything the nature of existence challenges you I'm glad you got more deeply and understanding of yourself
🤡🤡🤡
He's reading a script.
This is the worst acting I've ever seen Will Smith perform
He needs Iyanla 🙏🏻
I love how almost every time there’s a question will just looks to the side as if he is reading off of something. Really says a lot doesn’t it?
Fake
I would of like this video if it was the day after. But 4 months later?
Free Will Smith!!!!! 😪😪😪
with respect to Will Smith, peace of mind to you!  You can always come to Russia with your family for permanent residence.  Instead of a palm, there should have been a fist, this is the only thing you can apologize for.
You people insulting him personally commit so much mistakes in your ownlife. And seeing him commit one made u mad huh
Its almost like he's filming a scene for a movie.
Can’t stand him now. Sociopath. Take your money and leave the room. Hope everyone unsubscribes to his social media.
This comment section is uselessly salty
How many of you searched for "Anatsui" ?

You talking so much shows it's disingenuous. You should have stayed quiet. 🤫
He just being human, make mistakes, as everyone, apologise, not as everyone... trying his best, while having trauma, as everyone, and sometimes not being able to escape from them, as everyone. For that I respect him even more. 🙏
As long as Chris forgive him, I will okay
This apology video doesn't even make it in my top 10 youtube apology video.
Move on, like we all did
*video title:*       it's been a minute *actual video:* 5:44 seconds long bro lying from the start
i just knew in first 10 seconds how the apology gonna go
bro was probably on vacation in last 2 months
I accept your apology Will. You are a brave and good man, I believe this. Go in peace my brother,  live your life and find your happiness! One love.
God he's even trying to hide the fact he's reading off a prompter
Flavorless.
this is definitely the most apology ever
Re-think ur Marrige. A good woman makes U a better man and educates children to have critical thinking, kind and compassionate. U end up being what you surround yourself with.
You're human.
Your mistake will not be accepted
🤬
I’ve made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgment and I don’t expect to be forgiven
Will smith early 😴 😳
Why is he reading so slow?
This just needs a bit of interpretive dancing to a song that basically says you're not really sorry.
Get cailuo to say the same thing
GIRL BYE
"My history with Chris" well that's telling.
He apologized.  We can't know if it's genuine or not but I don't think its for us to say. It's Chris' apology.
That took a lot of guts. Good on ya, Will. Here’s to people working hard to understand themselves, looking life right in the eye, and trying hard to be better. Wishing you the best through this (Chris too).
It's been a year daddy.
Look will I never heard you say the f word in my entire life man to honest with you.
Not too "fogged out" to party hearty way into the night afterwards. Lol...my central trauma is this video.
Nah
Good apology honestly
*unsubscribed*
You can tell he's a good actor. Some people will even forget he's just acting and actually believe this
Use me as the dislike button
why didnt he sigh
LOOOOOOL 😂😂😉
It’s like watching little kid being told you have to apologize for doing something wrong but the kid doesn’t care and just wants to get this over with. Mostly the tone of his voice tells all of this.
Mad props for leaving the comment section open 😭
This guy needs help, such a broken and privileged individual. At the same time this apology only happened because he is such a narcissist and needs the attention
"some part of him" thinks it's okay, because he did it. #boycottWillSmiith
Oh look at the carefully curated,  filmed, and edited video that has a few softball questions for him to answer. Anyone who thinks this is genuine should give me a call, I have a bridge for sale.
if only he said two words without a break
wish the best of you WIll :)
Wait will smith has you tube channel
Will, your problem is that you did something vulgar in front of the entire world and at that very moment, you chose to not apologize to your victim. Instead, you chose to cry and portray yourself as the victim. That's a classic move of an abusive person and not to mention what "Karens"" do often in society nowadays. Now after several months of training, you're at it again with a fictitious apology in an effort to save your tarnished image. This reflects very poorly on you, your spouse, and all three of your offspring.
A failed effort to save his dying career......
3,500,000 Views....  110,000 thumbs up..........   seems about right LOL

"Disappointing people is my central trauma." This is how you are controlled. In your personal, and professional life. Are peoples' expectations reasonable? You are wrapped up in some twisted dynamics Will. The exit is there if you are brave enough. Reality check: you never have to work a day in your life if you organize your lifestyle properly. What do YOU want?
Is it just me or is this  will's worst acting to this day?
Man, you’re an actor. Come on
This is definitely one of the apology videos ever.
I CALL B.S. ...WILL WENT TO THE AFTER-PARTY, DRANK & DANCED THE NIGHT AWAY. THE "ONLY' REASON WILL APOLOGIZED IS BECAUSE OF THE MEDIA's (and the rest of the world's) BACKLASH. WILL (3 months later) APOLOGIZED WHICH WAS NOTHING THAN A "P.R. MOVE" READING QUESTIONS OFF OF A SCREEN. WILL ISN'T THE VICTIM... HE'S THE AGGRESSOR AND IS TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET HIS PUBLIC-LIFE BACK.
230 K dislikes btw LOL
He totally missed the tried and true rules of a youtube apology. 1. Look like you haven’t shaved,  2. Have circles under eyes (use make up) 3. Wear a white or gray hoodie  4. Sit on floor in front of couch 5. Cry on and off throughout 6. Say you are so sorry and that you don’t deserve to be forgiven 7. Say you are taking time off to “reflect” and “grow” 8. Stay off social media for 6 months. (He has been off social media but he was supposed to apologize FIRST!) His PR team are clearly amateurs
Videos like this are why the Bankerstein Tribe has hidden the dislike…  👎👎👎
This is highly produced and it had to be, because he is not sincere. He does not think he did anything wrong. So a simple real apology was not even possible. And therefor they made this stupid fake thing that only very naive young people or very biased people would fall for.
I am sorry for your pain.  It's obvious that you have gone through great suffering and turmoil.  But we are not Chris.  You do not owe us anything.  Reach out to Chris not to or through social media. Let Chris speak of your regret. Let him speak of your goodness and humbleness.  You do not owe us anything.  You just need to get better so you can do better.
Hahaha damn Will what happened to you? You had so much life and energy on freshprince. Seems like those illuminati hollywood elites got to yah buddy.
This is embarrassing. A grown man uploading an influencer apology 🤣🤣🤣

Man..you should just let go completely and leave the rotten stuff behind. Not for anybody's sake but your own. This situation should not be a public matter, but it is, and it's obvious how toxic it all is. No one but you even knows the half of it I reckon. Even so, your actions speeks loudly about the state of things, regardless of your reasons. You should just drop everything and renew your self, the hard and painful way, known to everyone that ever had to stare the cold and bitter truth in the face and move on. That, people will notice, and you will be redeemed. Better still, you'll probably feel great.
Full support you. Great
I had all this anger towards will smith over this for a while, but I'm thinking about it today and we are all just people. His life is under a microscope and he did something stupid you should never do, but it shouldn't ruin everything he's done in his life.
I hate that YouTube removed the dislike button, wish I see the amount of dislikes this got lol
He is never reaching out  to you
Props to Will for not disabling this comment section.  It is brutal stuff!
G.O.A.T ❤
All he needed to say to own it was:  "Chris, what I did to you was wrong, period. It was embarassing for everyone. My anger and frustration is my personal issue and I took it out publicly, and I betrayed your trust and everyone's trust. I need to work on myself, I need to let this serve as an example to humble me in the future, and I know I have a long road ahead to earn back everyone's trust. I am sorry. I hope one day you can forgive me. I will not skirt the consequences of my actions. I will not try to worm my way back into good graces. I will put in the good, consistent work, and when and if you are willing to accept me back, I hope I will have truly earned it. I am sorry I failed everyone as a man, and a role model."
The best apology video ever, not fake, truly from the heart.
I-Robot???
As fans and people or should I say men mostly we should all understand that we've had that moment of disappointment where you find yourself unable to fix it as alot of people thought differently of you and you've let alot of people down it takes time, bravery and a big heart to own up to and try and fix things only time will tell when all is in order for things to come right am not speaking as a fan am speaking as someone knows how much some mistakes cost you to Will just know that we as friends might have been disappointed although doesn't mean we don't support and love you and the work you do as we all human beings
ratioed  + yb better
Just want to let you guys know this video has 200k 👎🏾 .Don’t be fooled by the number of likes. No one is buying the theatrics.
Chris is your daddy.
Even though people normally can't see dislikes on YouTube  there's 230k dislikes on this video already.   So far the purpose of this video doesn’t seem to work very well.  This is some quality content for YouTube algorithm, not a real thing.
Keep your head up. Everyone makes mistakes. Learn from it and go from there. Much love for you and your family.

Anyone know the Dislikes now lol
he really said "sorry babe" cmon dude, leave that human
joe mama
You made a mistake. Mistakes don’t define us. We’re all humans. I choose to show empathy and love. I think your still a stand up dude Will.
That is not the way to come out of it .. if you need advice ask the common person not a PR crew or the Hollywood cream people that have no idea how real life is and what is an honest behavior
I love how you can tell there’s a entire film crew behind the camera
Much love Will.
this is how we do it
I love Will Smith and I appreciate the apology! I pray for your and Chris' healing. We need you both in our community ❤️  You both are part of village abd we grew up on.   I miss seeing your happy face and funny messages/videos that bring me joy. 😊
Bro this happened 4 months ago. Its practically 5000 BC. Your a bit late.
“Aaaah” “It’s rewind time.” “If I control rewind I would want fortnite and Marques Brownlee.”
This is one of the apologies of all time
Very few things in life are irreparable.
Videos like this gave YouTube a reason to take the dislike button away
This is the most apology ever.
You didn't even answer the question.
Hello Will Smith
FREE Brittney Griner! ❤
From a beloved actor to the scum of the earth. Well done will smith.
Would love for him and his family to take their millions of dollars and drop out of the public eye. Leave everyone alone you menaces.
I am genuinely disgusted
I mean what else can you really do at this point?  Apologize is it.  Let’s move on folks
242k dislikes for anyone wondering
Ok it's time to kiss & makeup....we all make mistakes....much love to the both of you
Y’all too invested in other peoples lives. He apologized it’s not your job to rank the sincerity of it.
I forgive you brother. I hope you get well and others loved.
You can just feel this was done begrudgingly. What's so hard about saying "I'm sorry Chris, I'm going to work on being a better friend" Instead damage control for next movie...
Came back days later- I’m happy Will leaves his comment section on. I’m still proud of him for apologizing because I know most people would not and would’ve doubled down and stood by the actions they did.   The comments are straight school yard Bs, the bullying tactics by some of these people on their keyboards is amusing. If they were going out of their way to make Will feel bad, they might have achieved that to a certain degree but I think they only prove themselves to be miserable on the inside, that it’s almost amusing to read, and I’m a fan of Will. I’ve learned you can’t take peoples negative words that seriously and Will leaving his comment section on is a good way to keep you grounded
At least he apologized for Christs sake y'all take a breather 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
don't apology !  Chris and many others  deserve  a similar smack
I hate it when he laughed in the video, showing how not serious he is about apologizing
I wish the best for Will. What he did to Chris was shitty, but most of the comments on this video are nastier than they have any business being. Bunch of schoolyard bullshit is what it is.
Wow after 3 months and everybody forget this sh** you came to apologize you gotta first forgive yourself
Will should volunteer at an abused woman and childrens shelter for a year then retry opligizing.
Please stop embarrassing yourself Will.
"Fogged out?" more like DOUBLED DOWN. You SHOULD be ashamed of yourself. You went out there AFTER you suckerpunched him and said..."I protect my family...just like King Richard" trying to justify it in the moment.  Don't pretend like you're sorry now that there are consequences. You are OBVIOUSLY apologizing to fans here- not to Chris. He already told you no he wasnt ready. So you are ...what? Forcing him? to reject your apology? why?  You just needed a sympathetic platform to do damage control. This is phony PR BS.
Ahh... It's rewind time
Live all things now start gain buoy!!
The best part was WS saying "It’s slappin time"
You're making it worse man !
“I lost all my fame, I need fame so I better make the fakest video on YouTube
You were 4 months late 💀💀💀💀
You dead wrong for that man dead dead dead wrong for that take that apology and just go you are never again to be one of the boys
Don't live under anyones expectations. The world has no compation for other peoples wrong doing,  just there own.
I just don’t understand why it was formatted in a Q&A. This man is a real YouTuber
He's apologizing but he doesn’t express being remorseful.
really tho you gotta respect him leaving the comments on
Its willin time

He sounds like he’s reading the script
It's been a minute, yeah let's keep it that way
Huh? How the heck is this an apology video Will? You need to get better people around you. I was a huge fan and this is pretty disappointing.
they made it so professional damn, i cringed out in the first 10 seconds
Respect. You can't deny his sincerity.
He is a good man.. but he needs to let go the relationship which is bringing the worst out of him
Will man you're my idol, regardless of what happens I'll stick by you.
His morbin, I can feel it
is this guy a psychopath tf
Lmao what if he just walked up to the camera and said "I'll fckin do it again"
Big legends ❤❤💯💯🙏
Bro, this seems like a ccp forced apology video.

Your voice changed and you slipped back into "Will Smith the Character" when talking about her.
He’s a professional actor. Remember that.
Don't buy it
Good for you Will Chris has moved on why can't we move past this it happened and Will is going to have to suffer with the consequences of his actions. THE END!
Just here for the dislike button and the comments
Honestly I forgot this even happened 😅  Lets break this down. First of all apology videos are one of the last ways you want to apologize about a situation. When you make an extensive apology, especially if it’s on camera you make it seem like you are trying to save your self from harm and you aren’t 100% sincere. Apologies are supposed to be short and quick and then forget, over doing it comes off as insincere, and makes it seem like your trying to hide something. Second of all, people (especially celebrities) apologize in this certain manner that society is too familiar with.   This how I think Will Smith should’ve apologized: Chris, I shouldn’t have done that, Im sorry. Overdoing an apology will just create more issues. A lot of time under doing an apology, believe it or not seems more sincere and honest
Brother  Will is a genuine person. I encourage you brother  Will to just remain humble. Allow brother Chris to reach out to you in time. You have done your part by apologizing so now Chris has to respond. I believe he will over time.
Gott give him credit for not turning off the comments section
I'm afraid I'm afraid  of the start of the vedio  recording 😁😀❤😘
Here is the thing Will smith made a mistake , he admits it and apologised and made another public apology , what else does the media want from him?  Society and media is not leaving any chance for people to redeem themselves or apologies without further trying to humiliate or destroy the person who is trying to seek redemption.... seriously what happened to the world? Does second chances not exist anymore?
“I made a severe lapse of my judgement”
Prayers for all involved, including Mr. Smith.  #LoveNeverFails

My favorite part was when he apologized and then the rest of the video
is he reading a script
How do the reposts of this video have more views than the original lmaooo
108k ‘likes’ …I ‘disliked’ when it came out it and it doesn’t show up…hmmm
I am, Me, My…. And so on. For me, no apologies were given. Saludos desde Mexico and I apologize for my grammar and spelling. Gracias
This comment section is a real shame. Will is bettering himself and taking responsibility.
This video is sponsored by my sons brand: ‘ITS WATER’ as you guys know…. sponsorships are essential to this channel so I can continue to bring you live LIES, all the time. 😄✌️🧚

He is completely brainwashed.
You’re Still Not Forgiven WILL! Disliking all your VIDEOS!
Out of all the movies I have ever watched, Minions Rise of Morbius is definitely one of them. Widely regarded as one of the best sequels ever made, "The Empire Strikes Back" further develops the characters and pushes the Star Wars Universe in a new and darker direction. After the Rebels' successful victory at the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) has dispatched thousands of probe droids across the galaxy in search of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the young rebel who used the the power of the force to destroy the Death Star. Along the way, Luke faces many challenges to overcome, including a vicious Wampa, AT-AT's, the conflict between good and evil, and the ultimate decision in completing his Jedi training or risking all that he fought for. Not only does the original cast return, but new fan-favorites are introduced here as well, such as Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).  In my opinion, it's debatable to decide which is the superior film. As a kid, I always used to watch the original on VHS, DVD, and Spike TV and constantly kept skipping to the Death Star Trench sequence over and over again. I wasn't really the biggest fan of "Empire" when I was younger, but I always enjoyed watching the Battle of Hoth sequence, especially with my Dad as it's one of his favorite moments. However, the more I kept re-watching and analyzing it in its entirety, the more I begin to understand why this film was so phenomenal. There's action, drama, comedy, serious moments (the iconic "I am your father" scene), and has some of the best music that John Williams has ever done. It even ends on a cliff hanger leaving the audience on the edge of their seat asking themselves, "Now what?"  The trailer is fantastic, and I love the ending of the dance! A critic's DREAM. We follow the main character through land after land, app after app, including candy crush, Twitter, DropBox, Just Dance, message apps, Facebook, pirates bay, Spotify, and so much more! They included tutorials for the game, to try and get us to play the game! Some people say this is just a long ad, and they are right. As a consumerist, I don't mind this! This movie is so enjoyable it feels as if you are flying to your happy place! 10/10. Would watch it again 7 times! A modern classic that in the future will be looked at as nostalgia! If you see this at the bargain bin, PLEASE, buy it. This movie is too good to look over. It's insane how the director can make this good of a movie! We need a Sequal, live-action remake, musical, everything! Watch this masterpiece, and you will agree with make. thank GOD for this movie! My emotions went insane for this movie! I can not believe how they made a movie about emojis turn into the entertainment powerhouse! I love emojis I want to be an emoji so much, I love it!
too long didn't listen.
You setting yaself up more & more everyday bro.. reinvent yaself.
Will needs to be a man with backbone and give a real apology to the ROCKS  especially Chris. If you are going to address Chris's mother address her by name, seriously this is sad for someone who has so much fan base, to stoop to this level of disrespect to his own people. What has happened that this man cannot seem to make things right ? It is a shame I hope he gets his life together and realizes that only a humble person apologizes sincerely,and does not add or take away from it!
this seems so genuine if he did this in a movie, im surprised how fake it looks in real life 😂
Wow what a great apology video, it has 0 dislikes.
Idk why but it honestly sounds like he’s reading off of a script.
Reading these comments are disgusting.. this is prob why Will took so long to this.. he apologizes wholeheartedly, yet y’all say it isn’t genuine. Had he not said anything, y’all say he needs to apologize.. its a lose lose…
Why does he look like he just came back from golfing?
i forgot who you were lmfao
LMFAOOOOO
My question is why were you laughing at first ?
Take the L Will smh
"Why didn't you apologize to Chris in your acceptance speech." 🤖👾
Cut. Take 3. Action! Upload the BLOOPER REEL Big Willy Will! Ack Ack!
I am now thinking travis scott's apology video was better than whatever this is
You're lucky Youtube didn't count the dislike button anymore
It's morb... Apologizing time
ok didnt ask
Great acting..
I like it Picasso 👌
Booooo
I actually kinda of feel bad for him now after hearing his apology
Dear Will, you have always been an inspiration to me, and I daresay millions of other people. Your work has been incredible. This mistake will have repercussions for the rest of your life, and even effects unforseen for your family, friends and fans, long after your your career. I wish you well, help, and hope. Your journey to finding these things must include those you have wronged, for they are within your successful journey, should you choose to embark upon the path to your best self. We all have regrets. However, we don't all stand back up afterward.
BLINK TWICE WILL! BLINK TWICE!
Will, I grew up watching your movies, in particular I very much enjoyed Men In Black.  You are still one of my favorite actors.  But you really messed it up this time.  What you need to do is focus on you, your career and improving yourself.  No one can change what happened in the past, but you can change the future.  What I would do is take an anger management class, see a psychologist, and show your fans and the world that you are really serious about becoming a better human being.  In Jesus name will, I will pray for you.
Pikachu[a] is a fictional species in the Pokémon media franchise. Designed by Atsuko Nishida and Ken Sugimori, Pikachu first appeared in the 1996 Japanese video games Pokémon Red and Green created by Game Freak and Nintendo, which were released outside of Japan in 1998 as Pokémon Red and Blue. Pikachu is a yellow, mouse-like creature with electrical abilities. It is a major character in the Pokémon franchise, serving as its mascot and as a major mascot for Nintendo.  Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, largely due to its appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion of protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue Ōtani, though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably Ryan Reynolds in the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by critics, with particular praise given for its cuteness, and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese pop culture.
you know hes only saying this because of jadas new boyfriend is behind the camera
I feel like he’s reading this off a teleprompter
My man is so far gone, very unfortunate
Narcissistic bullies get no respect from me. Ill never watch another movie with him in it. No actor is irreplaceable.

Sorry, I have to comment again. Please do not think of yourself as a POS. You have done so many wonderful things for all of us over so many years. If you need anything please contact me through FB.
Mr. Smith, I am a therapist and hae wored with healing my entire adult life. I am moved by your public apology. You have spent your life entertaining me. I hope you will continue. YOU ARE HUMAN!! While my forgiveness likely means nothing to you but I DO forgive you and I hope you can forgive yourself. I wish I could help you to heal.
I really wish you didn't go standard YouTube apology.  Dressed in white, sitting, starring dead center at the camera.  Come on dude, make us believe this is real.
It feels like a robot
You should start a podcast,I’d be here for that
The Mega Knight card is unlocked from Royal Arena (Arena 7) or a Legendary Chest. He is a melee-ranged splash damage troop with very high hitpoints and moderate splash damage. He appears with black spiked fists and huge armor, along with grey chainmail and a team-colored belt. When deployed, he will deal damage around enemy units around him in a 360º area around him, which deals 160% the amount of damage as his regular attack. If there are ground units between 3.5 and 5 tiles of him, he will stop moving and begin charging a jump attack which takes a few seconds, which deals double the damage than his regular attack. However, he's still vulnerable mid-air while jumping, and unlike a mid-air Hog Rider, cards like X-Bow will remain locked on to him. A Mega Knight card costs 7 Elixir to deploy.
You know whats bound to happen when people try to make apology videos.
how many times in the last few months do y'all think he thought about it
this apology sounds faker than santa
Will always be a fan a you great person actor father… everybody commits mistakes…
Will just can't stop taking L's
First thing I want to say too is Will Smith you are generally a nice guy I believe I also believe that every nice guy or human being on the face of the planet also is a piece of s*** at one time or another in their life and you will regret it likely for the rest of your life as you should. But I see awesome things hopefully in your future and get your stuff together and I can't wait to see
I personally think that Will Smith is actually a genuine person it's going through hard time like anybody else myself included at times and I truly believe that he's sorry and that he wants to amend things with Chris. I also want to say I am a fan of Will Smith not awestruck but because he's relatable and I love him. Will a pray and hope we will see you in some awesome movies in the future much love and peace and you know get well
My heart goes out to all parties affected. May you all heal fully and completely. I haven’t forgotten your positive and impactful contributions to this planet before you reached a breaking point. Heal and be made well 💌🙏🏽❤️.
your just strange @Will Smith
A woman be a king downfall 💡💡since the beginning of time
Force l ancien take care of dat mind set sit breathe chill jaja
Been a Will Smith fan for awhile he was an inspiration of mine, always listened to his music, watched all his movies etc.  As a long time fan I hope things get better for you and Chris and that you and Chris can hopefully work things out
Bro just get a divorce she is the reason for all your pain
Man I wish I could see the dislike button😐
i’m glad to see almost nobody in the comments is sympathizing. kudos to yous, cause this video is cringe lollolol
Thats ok man what yoi did was completly wrong but can be forgiven this seemed like a good apolgy vid but ypu are an actor wish you good luck
meh - this should have been done within a week after the incident - not 4 months later. oh well, at least you said something.
Whys he talking like Christopher walken?
This is worse than the john cena video about Taiwan
I would prefer to see a natural apology…looks so fake… but everyone can do something wrong is it not far all this rate with you… you’re always a nice actor nice and respectful with your fans… I hope to see you on movies soon…
This is truly one of the apologys of all time
There are more "likes" than haters comments. Yes 👍👍👏 if you hate comment. If you love like. Or leave a loving comment.
The grey apologizing guy: *is this my some kind of cousin?*
Came here for the comments. Was not disappointed.
I came to this video just to say….. I love the movie ‘I am legend’.
No matter what he said, it could never be good enough for the internet. People have found a new scapegoat to mob. That’s who they want Will to be now. Period.
CLM ✊️
You are stronger than before bro may GOD Gives you more wisdom
"It happened on Quest Love's award" ... like, he's distancing himself from the incident - "IT HAPPENED"
Just say IM SORRY CHRIS.
I have had a similar experience so I can’t judge you, especially now that you are apologizing. Just let it go and move in a better direction. I hope you guys can heal from this situation.
In the words of Florida Evans….Damn, Damn, Damn! But I still love you. To err is absolutely human my younger brother in my mind. Let your Mom and Cousin Chris Mom get that Sunday meal going and meet to chop it up, cry it out and move forward bigger better and much brighter than we all were moving before. ❤️
Just should’ve mcgregor’d it at this point
This is truly one of the youtube apologies of all time
i cannot wait to not see his new movie, which is the only reason for this video
You are still banned from the academy and we will still not watch your movies.
This is as real as Logan Paul’s apology
"Enojarse por un chiste es de mamahuevazos" -el Bananero
"Make sure to follow the script ok?"  I wonder how many shots it took to make this
This man can’t even say sorry properly!
Will Smith? You rather mean WILL SMASH.
damn he really got the full "basic YouTuber videos" package now, he's fully into it
It’s rewind time
He is a "human" who made a big mistake.  He apologized sincerely.  Who are we to judge?  Where are those perfect people who dont have need to apologize for their own mistakes?  Who are you to question the sincerity of his apology?  We are not his judge or jury.  We are his equally-flawed brothers and sisters.
this is the worst commercial I've seen
Bro apologized to everyone more than Chris 😭😭😭
Why didn't you apologize much earlier, Will? People know you did it because you saw how your fanbase was going down.
Isn’t he meant to be an actor?
Hope things gets better between Will and Chris :)
Would’ve liked to see the dislike ratio.
Feels like an ad instead of an apology video ngl 💀💀
2 Actors ruined their careers. RIP Will Smith's and Amber Heard's Reputation.
Why did his team let him do this? Way too over produced. If he felt that he needed to put this out in public he would have delivered better with a cell phone video. Love Will, I’m not understanding these moves his team is making
XD
Te amamos Will no olvides eso!  Y me alegra que sanaras tu corazón... Aceptar nuestros errores y disculparse es de los valientes no de los débiles! Eres un gran ejemplo de persona de ser humano en tu lugar yo hubiese hecho lo mismo o algo peor, creo... Así q sigue adelante y por favor no dejes de ser tu mismo, porque con ese Will crecí admirandolo y sin duda viéndolo como mi favorito.
My man's internet was shut off for 4 months
The part that resonates for me the most is how complex and nuanced this event is. All of us make mistakes, some of them are very dear, only most of us don't have the magnifying glasses of being a big celebrity.  I believe it is way to easy for people to play the judge. Was this apology planned? of course, it needed to be carefully planned, any misplaced word can backfire. I do believe Will is only human, I believe he needs to do more than this video to repair the situation, but I also believe he needs the chance to make mistakes even big ones, and set thing right. Just as all of us.
My man got ratioed
@WillSmith God I really wished you wouldn't have apologized publicly. Just had left it between Chris and you. Do I think what Will did was acceptable? NO!! But, we're ALL human beings and we make mistakes in life. I think you'll grow from this. Do I think prior to this was you mentally and emotionally going through something? Yes of course how long have you been in the public eye and have been a beloved actor and haven't EVER ..... done anything like this. Unfortunately,  no matter how sorry and how apologetic your apologize might be the "mob" won't forgive. Well at least for awhile. Unfortunately,  we live in a reality that people don't make HUGE mistakes and they're all perfect. So, they never need to apologize for anything. Your definitely forgiven from me at least and I'd still pay to go and watch your movies. Now , I won't forget it but like I've said everybody makes mistakes no matter who you are hopefully there won't be a next time. Thanks Will Smith!! Hopefully one day Chris and you can sit down and talk this all out.
Is he reading a script 💀

This guy s rep is destroyed and I believe that is not a such a  bad thing
Worthless apology
People make mistakes, I’m not condoning what he did which was horrible, but in the heat of the moment people tend to forget that there is something that takes over you and you don’t think clearly or about consequences or as Will said the people who you hurt. So Will I sincerely hope you and Chris can sit down and get this out in the open.
i just dont understand why he is sending this is to social media why cant he send this to chris brown instead make a call apologize visit him (i am not mad at him i respect him but just why thats all)
You should fire your pr team
Sorry, but it seems he is after getting his job back.  His msg sgould have been: " I have decided to hold my career and all other activities, as the most important thing to me this life or the after. That is Chris to do whatever pleases him and his family, then to forgive me even if that is the last day in my life"  Then leave it like that and do kindness towards the needy, animals and plants.  But will smith still did not reach such a regret leading to heal his soal.  Thanks for reading, Mohammed AlMawlawi

Anyone else would be on probation and if it had been a reg person run up there they would have been arrested right then
She didn’t have to tell u now did she lol will thinks we are stupid
She absolutely did have something to do with it. It’s on video sir. u were laughing
Yeah but no…. it’s weird now… nothing personnal.  Watching your movies feels weird.  And we don’t have to. You had your moment, move on. Enjoy your millions of dollars but forget celebrity.  Try something else.
There is a big difference between "I apologize" and "I'm sorry." He said he's sorry to literally everyone but Chris. Awesome product placement as well. Truly a genuine person.
Fake
Will Smith probably want that Neuralyzer from Men in Black right about now.
Please forgot the past, everything is okay. We might have to forgive you. I hope Chris and his family, forgive you.
Nice water advertising. A bit long maybe.
As real as the case of hate by the French actor juicy smuliye 😑😑😑😑
yo creo que meter zizaña entre dos personas es lo peor que los humanos saben hacer. Dividir. para sentirse mejores. Lo normal seria que Chris acepte las disculpas cuanto antes y demuestre que sabe perdonar y es un tio como Dios manda. Todo lo que alargue esto será más dolor al dolor. La gente es horrenda. Es rencorosa y malvada. Will tu ya has hecho tu parte. de verdad que asco de gente los que generan mas mierda y dudas. A tomar por culo todos.
Chal koi nahi khair aye ✌
Why would you even apologize, u did nothing wrong
I'm sure will smith's wife's boyfriend must be very proud of him.
People are always bitching about this kinda of thing. What you're all perfect?!
How can we be remorseful and not ashamed of ourselves? We find a way to forgive ourselves! 🙏🏾
Yes, Will, it has been a minute. 4 Months in fact. Better late than never I suppose.
So genuine
I, I, I, I, me, me, me ,me
I can honestly say that this is one of the apologies of all times
Too bad can’t see how many unlike 👎  I bet will smith is in two of the most YouTube’s unliked videos
We love you man.
This is genuine. What more do you want from him?  He says sorry to Chris, to his family, and to his own family, he says his behaviour was unacceptable, and he accepts that Chris is not willing to talk.  He speaks at length about how it made him feel only during the final stretch of the video, and when the question was about how he affected his fans. That’s an apology.  I don’t know what more some people are expecting him to do.
When you apologize to someone it doesn’t feel sincere if you give them that military point with your whole hand lol
You are the best
Pewdiepie had a better apology vid than this, both times lol
as of me writing this comment there are 108K likes vs 223k dislikes 🙃
It really hurts to see him like this..hope everything works out between them..!!
A little to little, a little too late!  Most of this apology was about himself.  He should be ashamed!
A public apology rather than contacting him personally to apologise demonstrates the lack of legitimacy and sincerity. I’d sack your PR team as this comes across as pathetic and staged.
How much staged you want this to be ?   Video Director: a…..CTION!
This is basically the Logan Paul Apology all over again
Apology video but still all about HIM. Dude just face it, you’re done. U just lost the respect of many people. What a shame.
I hope you get to go back on the big screen you legend
all im hearing is me me me me me me me me me me
I forgive you will smith
"It was all a fog at that point." Yea right dude. You stood up there knowing exactly what you did but felt righteous. This is, in its entirety, all bullshit
When you have all the money and fame in the world but you still feel empty...
Hi Will. I forgive this people that talks as if they would never have been wrong.. They are perfect. Or incapable to recognize any mistake from themselves.. i don't like people like this. and i choose to learn. not to judge.
Oh the bullshit that pours out when the rich realize they might lose everything….
lul i guess will smith can finally call himself a youtuber he made his first shitty apology video, it's like wathing a child grow up, i'm so proud
He’s only apologizing because it hurt his brand.
i wonder if the new gangster will smith will swear in his raps...
This is a dramatic ad for Just Water.
What WOULD have been the appropriate reaction on your part, in hindsight?  P.S. As shitty as this happening is, thanks for all the hilarious memes it spawned.
can you all just be nice?
Ever noticed he took more time to apologize to everyone else to keep up his image as a fun loving guy but only took like 15 seconds to apologize to Chris when the main focus was to apologize to him?
I can just smell the dislikes on this video. 😂
No need to do it on camera Will, maybe if the apology wasn't in this youtube format it could have been seen as genuine...
It's rewind time, no it's apologizing time
The product placement of the water its great, true sincere 😂🤣
Like anyone is buying this insincere crap.
Just came to DISLIKE. Bye.
You messed up now take it like a man and stop this pathetic apology it comes across staged, forced and fake, and has probably made things alot worse, you can't act your way out of real world problems
His life is still upside down.
Waahhh
For Chris or others to see: there's a huge difference between an apology and being sorry. An apology is expressing and acknowledging that you made a mistake, but to be sorry is truly feeling sorrow for your actions and feeling empathy towards the person/thing you hurt. Chris is still hurting, but he's recovering. He will address Will when he's ready, this kind of thing can't be rushed or forced, because people heal differently. The same goes for Will.
LMAOO 200K DISLIKES
Honestly, I used to hold Will in high regard.   Over the years it seems to me he is someone I do not want to support in his entertainment ventures.
Will I’ll be honest, I looked up to you growing up. I didn’t have much positive male role models in my life but you where one of them for me.   Life happens and people make mistakes and we grow and learn from them.  All you can do is give it your all and try to repair the relationships you damaged.
You're still that dope Will I used to look up to as a kid! Live on King!!!
Understandable have a Great day
Our Lord Jesus Christ suffers more than what Chris have suffered. But still He forgive those who persecuted him. We should be Christ-like as well, we human have the tendency to accumulate all of that painful experiences that Christ have suffered that night but nevertheless, Chris didn't do nothing, and for me that's an act of compassion and love. God is  the only judge. I forgive him, let's pray both for Will , to be Blessed with a compassionate, truthful heart, and Chris for the love and forgiveness ❤️
Ok, that water bottle product placement is a bit sus. The cap (from his own brand) is sus too.
M.I.B is nothing without will. Agent K forgives you man you saved the world breh and his life
I'm sure Will wishes he can use shenron dragonballs.
Dude learned from travis scott

He doesn't own anyone a damn thing, he is human after all and I can't believe what more than apologizing could he do, to satisfy the comment section. Although I am not a fan of Will, I respect him for owning up to his mistakes. Period.
why everyone keep disliking the video?

i’ve been thinking about will these last months and i knew he was deeply hurt. i learn so much about this man, he’s been unproblematic all these years but he’s a human too, he can make mistakes. awesome man, awesome family. they deserve the world
I'd like to remind you fine people that Will said, "I apologise" and not "I'm sorry". There is a very distinct difference between the two. Apologising to someone feels forced while genuinely feeling sorry for your actions shows empathy and self realisation. Very poor and forced apology attempt.
Mf sounds like a robot
If Will was a real man he would tell this to Chris personally and not wait for months while then ultimately turning it into a way trying to go viral...
should said sorry to jada's boyfriends too.
We love you will smith 🥰🥰😍🥰🥰
If I took four months.....to finally sh#t in a bucket and show you the contents would you all clap and be impressed ?. Feels like a hostage video, and grudgingly spoken.
This guy is a class act…. He should be in jail
Me and my boyfriend were so emotionally and physically moved watching Will Smith and his deeply heart felt apology, that we were squirming in our seats and a little passion poop leaked out of both of our butts! 💗💓
What a sad life
lol this is mad weird
Will, you are still my favorite person, this changes nothing
It’s okay Will
How can I dislike this video
The perverse communication techniques of a narcissist🤮
Fake Will Smith….
Even if Chris and God accepted this apology, people would still criticize.
"I apologize to the people of Los Angeles. My behavior has been improper, and I accept the consequences. I ask my fellow Angelenos for their patience, and understanding. I will be participating in alcohol and anger management treatment. You deserve better from me, I can be better. I will be better."
yaaa its apology time
This truly is the apology ever made. Somehow, I get a morbin' feeling.
Your first step in a 12 steps journey to be a man again is to divorce that witch.
Don’t ever let no one take you to that place ever again.
NOPE
This is foul the way people are doin Will, people get checked like that everyday, people r quick to pull out the phones to record other people takin “ L’s” and then post it on the net for the world to laugh at!..but peolpe wanna crucify Will for doin the same thing, it’s disgusting and highly hypocritical of society, the audacity of us to pick and choose what offends us, Will is human just like the next guy…and CR needs to stand on what he did and not act like a victim, this wasn’t a comedy show and what’s worse is JP wasn’t even up for nomination, Will was…this was the 2nd shot that I know of that CR took a shot at her, and I can c myself doin the same thing Will did…I would apologize to everybody except CR!!!
What happened doesn't mean Will is a bad person, and his apology is the right thing, his Human
Can't wait for the movie that will showcase the nuance and the complexities 🤣
Just like any YouTube apology this isn't anything close to genuine.
Fan from India sir
Send this video to Paul Rodriguez. I'm sure he'll get a laugh.
Is there someone perfect on earth, I don't think so....... He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone......
Too little, too late.
Will Smith isn't even done morbin'
Nuances and complexities….lol. You overreacted and that’s it, not complicated. Haven’t watched one of your films since. How bout being more genuine on why you got pissed
you can’t apologize reading off a card.
Uncle phil would be dissapointed by the act and this apology.
Disappointing.. The description as well is "Thanx Yall" :|
Listen to him,give your self a good idea 💡 buy a Bible,stay bless you and your family.
You know, you didn't let me down. As a grown woman who is emotionally mature I understood what happened, right when it happened. You acted without processing first. Things happen. People make mistakes and the biggest part is that you realized it was a mistake.

#WillSmith
Great job brother,now let’s God do the rest for you, follow up your brother Gino Jenning.
You’ve almost perfected the YouTuber apology video👏👏👏
Don’t worry…bout a thing…
how the video was made and how he talked in the video and body language, the apology was forced on him.
You've just got Will Smithed   Share this with all your friends to totally Will Smith them.
China is about to invade Taiwan due to the states using the island as a proxy. #wakeup
A camera man really nailed the whole genuine feel down.
"How many boxes do I need to check for an apology video?"
PR Team…hmmm, a little to late to come up with this. Just sad
this aint it
Everyone makes mistakes,  I hope people realize that
L
You are human and should not be put on  pedestal! Perfect is God not Will! You made a Mistake, with time the people you said you disappointed them will have someone else disappoint them! People are not perfect! We all make mistakes! Forgive never forget and move on!
I don't see whats he apologizing for
Well apparently common sense isn't common 🤦‍♂️
they made... a set.. and put a bunch of products in it so an ad... and put will in there and basically asked him like a child "now sayyy sorryyy.."
"It's Rewind Time" in Chris Rock's voice.
Get that divorce, then come back with the apology explaining how you was brainwashed. I WILL EXCEPT THAT, QUICK.
The problem is, you committed a crime. If any one of us had done the same thing you did we'd get the handcuffs. And to see Denzel comforting you and laughing with you later was sickening. I stopped watching all your content and all his content and deleted it from my libraries. An apology is not enough. And if you're going to apologize, at least try to get rid of the smug attitude, you're ego is what did you in from the start, if you can find a way to get rid of it, you'll make more friends and some might actually start watching your shows again.
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself" one of those sentences that just made the whole apology worthless to me...
Man,you are wealth already,Go enjoy your family and cash,enough os enough!!
I feel so bad for him 😭 he had to do it for a reason… Chris might’ve said something really rude 😕
What did will smith do😦😦
Kinda sad that people can’t even APOLOGIZE without being bashed.
i have so much mixed feelings about this
Lemme see the behind the scenes and the bloopers for this one
The way he talks and reads those questions like he never read them before.... bro CRINGE!!!!!
Gross
DAMAGE CONTROL
Starts it like every great YouTuber apologize, a big ol sigh
That was 4 months ago that was the past get over it
This is not a public matter. He does not need to share his story with the world.
Honestly, Chris won’t accept your apology. You wanna know why? He posted on Instagram right after you posted this video. You embarrassed him in front of millions of people, as well as his family. I hope he never reaches out to you cause all I saw in the video was narcissism.
I’ve rewritten this like 8 times but I’m going to just say it. I don’t think the apology is good. But whether or not it’s fake: I hope will learns from his mistake that he made. I hope he makes good decisions from here on out and will make a legitimate apology. It will take time but I think there is a good person underneath this whole facade. Apology sucks, but I hope he finds peace.
ok then...
Ah ha ha that's 👋  That's 👋
Wow what a happy sincere apology 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Good thing there's a button to not recommend this channel.
this video currently has 263 k dislikes
Good article in Variety about this video.
We all know that he deserves a forgiveness!!!
“ i am overwhelmed by what god is calling on me to do and be in this world” - will smith. Become Muslim my brother and live the truth.
That sigh in the beginning shows he really regrets what he dihhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh XD
Meh.
The title of this video LMFAO
No " I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement" .. not good 2/5
This man has been beat down into apathy. If he could be sincere, he would.
At least he’s bringing light to the situation that nearly everyone has forgotten about. I dunno what makes me always play devil’s advocate.
@pewdiepie we need an apology review!
Dude...I really appreciate your humility.  Being a public figure, I can see how people come to a place where they think YOU should never respond with your emotions.  But...we are all fallible.  We ALL make mistakes.  I just wanted to come here to encourage you.  You've been an AMAZING example of what it means to self improve and to speak life in ways that most will never do the work.  It is obvious that your well is deep.  It is also obvious that you are broken.  Thank you for taking the time you needed to start the process of getting better.  Healing is a journey.  I admire your courage.  I will continue to lift you and your family in prayer.
It's tired
Everyone didn’t like this apology but I’m honestly just fine with it. At least he did something and if I was in his shoes, I don’t think I would’ve done better than this 😂 you guys expect great things from him just because he’s famous. In the end, it doesn’t matter anymore.
This video was produced by Susan wojcicki
Te quiero will smith 😭
Bros Apology Has A Whole Backdrop, Furniture Setup N Movie Crew Wtf😂😂😂
Apology accepted. Shine that light, Baby!
Lame. You feel sorry for yourself and it shows. 🤦‍♂️where’s Uncle Phil when you need him.
Wow Will, that’s some nice acting over there for an apology.
You done good.  You do good, Will.  Because you are a good man.  Appreciate all the good you have done.  You are a human person.
its better on 2x speed
Thanks for this, Mr. Smith; I respect you so much for doing this in such a vulnerable and honest way. Folks:  this is what real humility is. This is what real introspection looks like. This is a man who knows that the most important work you’ll do in your life is the work you do on yourself.
Here I am, eating food, big belly and shirtless, trying not to laugh at the video.
Only 3% of the people who viewed this crappy video liked it. Who are the losers?
I never looked up to you. I just look further down on you now.
Will isn’t finish yet with fully wrapping and understanding the possibilities on how life can be lived. Being someone that is understanding, respectful, loving and caring.   Although, one can say things that are upsetting. It is important to understand the intention of that person and that ultimately they are just you in a different body experience.   Although, I see in you Will that you went through multiple stage of comprehension on what happened that night. I can also see you struggle to assimilate other concepts that you have within you.   Take care
thank you for being true and honest and handling the consequences of this with such grace and awareness
At least he tried to apologize, but the algorithm of the whole YouTube apologies just fucks with my brain LMAO
Time to start playing roles outside of your element. Take the Chris Brown route perhaps. Any way you choose to move in your career, I hope you can keep ya mental and know the folks you love you vs the people who admire your work within the parasocial realm of entertainment. Stay up bad boy 💯
The nuances I never heard a person say that word until now. I literally had to look it up
Haha someone isn’t getting anymore movie offers  😂😂
We love you Will❤️
This feels like the words don’t want to come out, he’s a good actor but I guess he can’t act like someone that is really sorry.
Just wanted to see if there is the beginning sigh in this video. Yes, there was one
The best
he forgot to bring his dog 9.5/10
ALL DESERVES SECOND OPPORTUNITIES ,,,MISTAKES ARE A PART OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR
I encourage everyone to watch The Behaviour Panel’s analysis on this.  (Or any of the behaviour analysis channels). 👍🏼
Will you’re lost buddy
Time can heal all wounds all we can do Is try to forgive but not forget. And continue to choose the right way forward and try to be a better person. And always think before we act and communicate with people as soon as possible so things don’t fester. I’m disappointed but I respect you and hope that you will do better in the future. I wanna be proud to be a Will Smith fan again.
I think the smart move now would be to go back to your roots,reflect on everything and drop an album.Loved your music back in the day and it might be refreshing to start over,as hard as that is,I feel you will get the understanding you deserve through the music like you always have,stay strong bro.Like you said,you are only human
Yawaaa it’s rewind time
This literally is for everyone but Chris
Not an apology. I usually really couldn't care less about pointless hollywood bs, like these people are somehow better than us... but this whole thing was shameful. This is absolutely something to be ashamed about.
here is the problem i have i believe in second chances but this just looks fake to me, i dont believe he is actually sorry for his actions but more so for the consequences and that is a problem
He sounds like a robot
Bruh its the standard "YouTuber Apologie"...
Took him this long to realize he was a fool.
Ever since I was a kid I was always a fan of yours. Didn't matter what the naysayers said I always stuck up for you. didn't matter how dated Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was I stood up for you. didn't matter how bad Wild Wild West was I still stood up for you. I won't stand up for you anymore.
This is what happens when someone with little empathy and extremely an extremely inflated ego gets publicly shunned. They cannot fathom their wrong doing truly so they say the words, trying to do whatever will bring back their image, and then make the other 99% be about how hard it was for them. I've had these people around me all my life unfortunately and it's always the same story.
Even though I'm in the comments section and I'm not sure if you'll read this, I hope you do. Shalom Aleichem If you accept it Mr. Smith. I think you should accept it and carry on, but when you do carry on from this, like most of us have had to do, carry on learning from this. You know that next time something like this happens, you'll handle it like Yeshua Hamashiac told us all to handle it. Remember, we are all human beings, this includes you and every single movie star, TV star, pop star, politician and anyone else who ends up on screen. Human beings get angry, but we don't need to stay angry. Don't let that spirit take over your life. We should do what is right because it is right, not because we'll gain popularity from it. Remember Beatitudes Mr. Smith.  Kol Tuv, B Shalom.
This is what toxic relationships do to people, I feel bad for will but he's the only one that has the power to correct his situation
Must have a film due out soon. 🤭
At the end of the video : I would like to thank Raid Shadow Legends for sponsoring this video.
Talk about to little to late, AND fake AF and not believable !!! Play the victim much???
I'm sure reminding everyone of this is going to make Chris reach out. Man, narcissists are tough.
I don't buy it
its apologizin' time...
He just has to wait for Chris to be ready.   He still calling it disrespect and insult, so why is Chris supposed to respond
you need to just divorce your girl mate, she's messed your head up prince
I relate a lot to what he expressed. I too have to detangle remorse from shame.
Only because of the backlash consequence of his action is he trying to apologize/please us all. DON'T BE A FOOL, if it was backstage he would've been proud of his actions. True nature came out during the situation & it's always easy to go back to acting & saying sorry afterwards but that doesn't change what he decided to do when the time came. Can't respect Will Smith anymore as the person he's portraying
Its ok, we are all humans.
Damage control...that's all this is...pure and simple!  Millions of dollars are at stake, and he wants to find a way to keep the gravy train rollin'.
Chris said wait but you couldn't give him that courtesy. You had to make a video "to apologize" which disrespects his wishes. This is obviously about you trying to do damage control. Chris comes a distant second to that for you. That much is obvious.
He's just sorry for the money he's losing
Do people really care about this?
never to late. at least its a good start. but  try on the followup to avoid that perfect setup around you , it negatively affect your authenticity. just be yourself in a real environment
ugh
I feel that when someone apologizes it is the right time to forgive them especially if it is genuine. This is truly a genuine apology. Most of the time people won't even apologize so I think it is a time to show love and understanding when someone makes that effort. I think it is very unfortunate when someone apologizes and the offended party takes the opportunity to display more pain and continues the drama. They should make an effort to feel the apology and let it reach their heart. Will Smith is a great man ... We All Know This ... he was just under tremendous stress that evening. Can't we all show him love and forgive him. ... he is worth it. You are worth forgiving, Will Smith, ... you are an amazing human being and this incident should not be what defines you. We all make mistakes. True friends would not shame you for long.
It’s about time Will 👏🏾
My guy about slaping someone in the face months ago: "i spent the last three months replayinf and understanding the nuances and complexities of what happened in that moment." Man, it was not that much.
He forgot dragging in a dog. All YouTube "apology" videos have dogs in them. Jayda and her entourage of boyfriends didn't even think of that.
LMAO i have return dislike addon and this vid has 219k dislikes (and 107k likes)
We still need an apology video for Wild Wild West
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Just Water $$$$$$
"It's been a minute"  That happened months ago bruh
Ha! I don't believe you bruh
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I still love you will! Everyone makes mistakes and it seems you've grown from it.
107k likes to 218k dislikes at the time of this comment. I have an Chrome addon called "Return YouTube dislikes" for anyone wondering.
too much champagne b4 the show?
He should've just shown a clip of the apology speech from Hancock.
Crish : i dont wanna talk bout it man Will : welp, guess i'll talk bout it to the world on my YouTube channel, then. . Man, leave crish alone! He want to forget it! People startin to forget about it and you bring the pain again. It's not about Crish or his family, it's about you and your family. It's always about you all. Disgusting
Well, he made his apology. Was it two printed sentences?  No.  It's pretty much the double whopper of apologies.  I hope CR and family forgive for their own sakes.
Not feelin it
I Am Legend 2: I Am Sorry
Will smith really got BBC'd
Mans coulda just said "Sorry. What I did was inexcusable." like 2 months ago but decided to make the most youtube apology of all youtube apologies months after the fact
I still love Will Smith...  he made a dumb rash decision but he still the same guy. The apology was simple and sincere, I really want to see Will and Chris talking again.
This is why we need the dislike button back.
So far: Dislikes: 218K
You full of you know some thing definitely not true
i literally cannot believe this is real. it’s so funny
4 months to prepare for your apology to us and not him? Uhmazin!
Um....staged, unrealistic and really tortured.  This feels like a gimmic and not an apology.   Plus, it's not for you, Will to apologize on tv/YouTube/social media...talk to Chris, not us.   Let Chris say you/Will apologized and it's over.  Informal apologies are just meant to make the person apologizing feel better.  I honestly, don't accept this and also hope that Will gets away from what is holding him back, holding him down and making him do things you can clearly tell  he's not happy with.  This is not genuine.
Huge fan of Will, but what I wanted to see was what steps he planned to take moving forward. When I witnessed something similar and the aggressor apologized to me, it felt hollow with no assurances that something like that wouldn’t happen again.   I wanted him to say he would get help and what he was doing to actively work toward ensuring nothing like that happened again.
Uncle phill would've been disappointed in you will.
186k dislikes. Big difference between being remorseful for your actions, and being remorseful for the consequences  of your actions.
218k dislikes. LMAO
Ayo Will, keep your head up! What's in the past is in the past! Big props to you for being the bigger man. Now all that's left is to KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU DO and don't let anyone or anything stop YOU! Keep looking towards the future! Today will vanish, but TIME WILL REMEMBER YOU!
Will is such a great actor' and it shows.
What an insincere apology. He very clearly doesn't mean it. He's just sorry that he's had backlash and even then I don't think he even cares that much about that either.
Ahahahha.
Not complicated at all ... You got angry, you fucked up ... own it and move on. The reasons why dont matter
This is only getting more embarrasing
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. I NEVER WANT TO SEE WILL SMITH EVER AGAIN.
👎👎👎
I'm a big enough man to forgive you. All the hatred that you've been getting is unnecessary. Everyone who opposes has no right to call themselves a fan. They can't understand that acting without thinking is something that all humans have in common. Apology accepted. ♥️
I will bet real money that someone's holding a script behind the main camera
Love u will smith ❤️❤️❤️❤️
He didn't reflect on his decisions, he reflected on his bank account.
I can see the dislikes.
…Since I heard applause, I’ve been a minute since you seen or heard it from me I’ve been swerving cars
Chris needs to forgive him. Not us.
Fake af
Everyone is so high and mighty in the comments. The dude F'd up. No one, including Will, is debating that. But you all are acting as though you never said or did something that you were later sorry for, let alone in front of millions of people. So easy to point a finger at someone famous rather than looking at your own life, isn't it?
I can't believe this isn't satire.
Is this an example of the police failing to prosecute black on black crime or the wealthy not being held to the same accountability standards? Both?
Apologize to yourself for becoming a cuck.
You have my support. Mistakes are made but, I have to thank you for the amazing movies you made. Everyone should have the chance to move on.
...
somehow You've made it worse...
vid has 217K dislikes, good to know people still do that
So far my favorite YouTuber apology yet
This is about as real as Jada's love for Will
Don't care. You're horrible and your family is a mess
James 4:9, KJV: Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
Why are you talking so slow. It doesn’t add any beneficial impact for the audience, it just makes it feel very weirdly paced and a bit disingenuous
No bro. You need to sit and let someone interview you. Ask you the real hard questions.
No one is perfect... Forgive yourself
This doesn't feel like a true apology but more like a PR commercial... Title cards, perfect light, the straight face and solemn attitude, even feels like the whole talking is just a script rather than an  honest heartfelt apology... I guess they think that this is better than silence but at the end a scripted apology is not enough.
His actions and how he's handled the aftermath so poorly are pathetic. Will's career is going to be in the toilet for a long time, maybe forever.
Fart
How come you went to Epstein Island?
Just 4 months for an apology as sincere and Jada's fidelity in which barely a minute actually addresses the offense. Man, Will really be down with the fallen.
This apology video is the only insult. The whole thing is Jada's fault. Man up and ditch her Will.
That’s a nice RV 🗿
Too late you hurt so many people
Will, you're getting too old for this sh*it. So are we. Don't do "apology videos" just learn humility and civility and then we'll see.
Clown
aun te admiro mas que antes al defender a tu pareja el hecho de que ella no valore  eso es su problema no te desmorones, al menos ya sabes cuanto valor tenia tu pareja a tu lado.
It’s been a lot longer than a minute Will.
Bruh stop you were never the bad guy. Grow a spine.
The apology is as real as GTA 6
At least Will apologized (time and time again)...  The REAL question is: *Where's Chris's apology?!*
🤡
The fact that it took him a good minute to walk onto the stage means this wasn't just a sort of heat of the moment thing, he had ample time to think about his next decision. Not that I was a huge Will Smith fan to begin with, although I did think he was funny in some of his movies, but I've lost all respect for this guy.
for everyone wondering this video has 216’000 dislikes atm
"I'm sorry babe"   Wow, so he's still staying with her
Make sure to shop at the Will Smith Store.
Man, you are my mentor no matter what. Things like this will happen once in our lifetime and we react somehow, however, that doesn't mean We are that person in that moment.
He is totally deleting the negative comments. I came back to check and mine is gone.
U human dude! I still got love for u.
He said "I apologies" to Chris and his mom but "I'm sorry" to his family... saying just saying "I apologies" is not an apology.
he just got ratioed
3:50 - 4:00  My thoughts exactly on this video
Looks like he is reading a prompt and could not see clearly what he is reading
216,000 downvotes and 106,000 upvotes? LOOOOOOL
Hard to believe this one incident has ruined you and your image, as a previous  fan I hope to someday look past this. I wish I knew why it is still bothering me, bothering me enough that I can't watch none of your movies without being upset, disappointed and sad. I feel deeply sorry for the anger you uncontrollably released  caused by a female. I understand no one is perfect, but having an outburst like that Clearly shows your lack of happiness, love, and fun. Good luck, I hope to be a fan one day again.
Jada's boyfriend will be proud of you.
This video has a weird creepy vibe like a hostage video.
The most sincere apology ever.
This really wasn't a bad video, I think the setting was a but much. But well said imo
Time to move on ppl he apologize. Ppl just like drama too much.
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.   (1 Thessalonians 5:8) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
Thank you Will Smith. You have blessed us with another youtuber apology meme that will last maybe a  month or so
Boooooo
When the bullies mom makes the bully  apologize to everyone he has bullied:
That 4 months of training really paid. Haha
Bravo Sierra. You just want the s#!t storm you created to end.
you need to ditch that sith lord in disguise
I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself does that make sense
Why were you laughing and then all of a sudden you turn into a straight face and got mad
I’m sure your movie deal accepts your apology.
I’ll always be a huge fan of Will. He’s real, he’s genuine and he’s humble enough to sincerely apologize.
What a lovely production.
This is obviously part of some contract he has to fulfil.
Bro wtf? Go to confession..not here
Fake, you weren't wearing a hoodie in a dark room
Made the video an social apology to save face to fans and save branding. He could care less.
I had to put the video on 1.25 because he was talking to slow
No amount of fake likes you paid YouTube to place on your video will ever come close to the dislikes you'll get from actual accounts. Haha that's hot! 🤡
Looking at the bright side at least we have a funny meme
It's rewind time
Bullshit apólogy to one of the most ridiculous moments in TV history!
If you haven't apologised in person to all the people mentioned here and this is the first apology they hear. Then this video isn't for them.
Man Chris acting like a female…Will, don’t apologize!
Just here to leave a dislike
At the time of writing this comment this video has  over 216k dislikes😬😬
Héllo leio sûsas HISTÓRIA Pelo mundo 🇧🇷👏📰🇨🇭🖼
Now what do you say to all the people who tried to justify your temper tantrum during one of the most prestigious shows in the world? Will didn’t initially apologize to Chris bc he was in a fog, not bc he wasn’t sorry. If this apology video four months later doesn’t show he had instant remorse, what will?
Good on ya Will.
It was not good
2:52 He's literally about to crack up laughing
Must after that Bad Boys 4 paycheck.
"It was confusing, it was shocking" NO, it was wrong, and you know it, and you not wanting to feel ashamed makes this "apology" completely moot.
FYI: This video has 106K Likes and 216K Dislikes
Maximum love and respect brotherman.   ignore everyone else.
Many people are not interested to watch any future "Will Smith" projects. This channel is managed by a group not the individual. I feel sorry for the reputations of his employees.  In my opinion it's a fake apology. The actor is legit being an actor and not speaking from the heart, only saying his lines to the crowd.
His team messed this up.Needed to be waaay more raw like joe Rogans apology not a 1990s Oprah Winfrey sit down and the cheesy framed staged words on the wall in the background. Oh ok! 😂
Wanna know why the world sucks?You're all acting like he committed a war crime for defending his wife's honor. Will Smith, you're one of my favorite actors & what you did made my respect for you increase tenfold.
Bruh, YOU ARE DONE!!!!!!
Prove it.
Honestly, if people were to have all their mistakes shown in front of the world too - I think they might be more forgiving. Will has apologised, it was never going to be a perfect apology, however it is a great deal better than the completely insincere apologies we often see from youtubers. When does a lack of acceptance of an apology become bullying? This man is subject to online bullying but because he is a celebrity people don't see it this way. This is how you get instances where people end up taking their lives. Then people start to reflect when it is too late. How many scandals has Will Smith been associated with? Yes it was a massive embarrassing and harmful mistake which has ruined people's perceptionsof him and his career. Isn't that a punishment in itself. This was bad, and he acknowledged that. Why do we live in a culture where people don't accept apologies?
Fake as
we love u will
came here after watching memezee
And am support you because from where am from i will do the same to protect my family but people forgot what is the meaning of being a man to protect your family
YaAAAh it's apologizin' time!
Mr. Will Smith Am a big fan of you and your work What you did is the right way to protect your family and your name
لحين تبغ تعتدر سالف صار له 4 أشهر يعمي
What happens when you go from Hero to Zero
I hope pewdiepie makes a review
This apology is as real as Marvel's shitty CGI
one bad moment in someone's life does not delete all he/she did up to that moment. we all make mistakes and we keep leaving our life - because he is a celebrity doesn't mean its worse. BUT i am not saying that was not WRONG - it was, but some times we do stupid things.
I applaud him for being accountable. More people need to admit their mistakes and make amends for them. 👏 💛
Howany dislikes does this have i Just ask
Too little too late. Not here for it..
Despite the general tendency to tear him to pieces, I felt like this was a genuine apology.
It's been months bro 💀🤡
Will Smith is completely lost without Uncle Phil’s advice
I liked the part where he said "it's apologizin' time" and apologized all over himself, truly an apology ever.
BTW Guys if you're curious how many dislikes there are it's 215k
Omg SNL should have a field day with this one!
He sounds like a tts.
Yah
Even apology acting is not great 😂🤣
One step forward, two steps back - apology botched.   If you ain't gonna tell the truth why bother?  Oh yeah this is also supposed to be damage control - also  botched.
Lost me at that “just water” product placement.
Honestly Will, you should be ashamed. You're saying you're about peace and love but actions speak louder than words. Btw, I never heard an "I'm sorry Chris". That's because you're not sorry, you're sorry about the backlash you have received...
Chris should be allow to take things in his own time and at his space. I ain't a fan of this guy anymore,  stop watching and might never watch his movies. He is rude, disrespected the Black community & moment
Better acting in After Earth.
Now that was some good acting right there. Bully!
Will Smith Good job i hope your days get better and better and all let this move on and all come together we are all human we all have our emotions ❤
I Forgive Will Smith
lmfao 🤣
This took 4 months of reflection? Half the world knew you f***ed the second you got out of your chair. Why do famous people feel the need to do this kind of thing on social media for the world to see? It taints it with a need to be free from the public's ire. Take what you deserve and be a man about it.  How was it so hard to do this on the phone that first week? "Chris, I'm sorry. I made a mistake, I hope you can forgive me, and that we can move past this. Call me if you want to talk, if you don't I understand and I will be here if/when you do." Simple. As. That.
It's like I'm listening to microsoft text to speech

apologies accepted
I have to be honest but I feel bad for him. We all have those silly moments that we would regret for years on and the moment that he made was obviously regretful and it jeopardised his career. I think we can all forgive him.
You can tell he’s like on the verge of tears
Bruv, you are a certified beta!! Bottomline!! Take the red pill and see in what a demonic spawn you are caught!!! Noone in the right mind believes you 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
“I want to apologise” is not the same as “I’m sorry”  an apology is regretful, sorry is sorrowful. Sorry means so much more
Am I the only one that is just like 'ah come on just shut your damn mouth' when I see ANY celebrity giving ANY kind of moral speech?
Said a whole lotta nothin
When someone "apologises" instead of saying "I'm sorry" it means they're not genuine.
Hi Will,everything will be alright.  It was a real explosive moment and emotional. Thankyou for apologising . People are complex and I don't think you behave like that normally. Not the end of the world.  You won with your talent. And sabotaged yourself. All in the same night. You're a great guy Will and I haven't lost faith in you. You are strong and will rise. Peace be with you. Friends forgive.
Will!! It's not all about YOU. It's about Chris and his trauma.. just say "I am sorry Chris"
💯💯💯 we all FCK up
People: "you let us down"  Will: "yea but it hurts me more than it hurts you so it's ok"
you did it
Will why did u turn the comments on on this video😂 u knew there was gonna be a million trolls, f them tho ur still one of the best actors and one of my favorite still
Bro he made one mistake and y’all go crazy. If he wasn’t genuine then why would he stutter? It would be scripted right? He is genuinely apologizing to Chris because he is sorry and he believes that he has let many down. For example: his fans, family, Chris’s  family and Chris himself.
Wow I'm, I'm watching this um, video and, I'm very um, impressed by um, his masterful lies, and um, the great lighting and um, the Camara work even um, the sound mixing is um, great. Never mind the sheer amount of God damn UM's Ive literally had a more coherent conversation with a demensia patient for Christ sakes man this is a cautionary tale of an abusive woman.
This is not an apology.  Try again, Mr. Smith.  Minus the acting, playing the victim card and that chuckle and smile in between your so-called “apology.”
Blink twice if you're being beat up by her boyfriends.
The world is sick, Love is the cure....🤣🤣
Какое нах извинения мужик ты защитил честь и достоинство своей семьи за это  извинения не просят ....
215K Dislikes LMAO
You really trying to save your box office numbers with this one. If you meant it, you would have said something much sooner like 4 months sooner, than now when you have some projects in the works you want to release.
Cringe
Y’all violating in the comments goddamn
Let all those who don’t make mistakes please stand up? Oh…you also make mistakes? Be careful, the pendulum might come back and swing your direction. Release mercy to someone else, and mercy will return to you when you need it.
He's young he did nothing wrong
Update 106k likes to 215k dislikes
Your a great actor this apology is bs
cliche apology video part of the standard youtube arc
Any thoughts on your son condoning that behavior?
India  audience  always love you 🇮🇳 💖
0:23 might be the most robotic thing I’ve ever heard in my life
I like the part where Will says to Chris "its rockin' time"
That product placement though…
Wild wild west 2 confirmed
Will, your not a pos. Thankyou for the Book ( Will). Keep your eyes to the stars....
Where’s the dog?
It was so stupid
Why will you ruined your life??? You had everything how could you
“I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk” sounds like something you’d say to someone who was in the wrong, not something you’d say if you’re in the wrong. He might as well have said, “I might have over reacted, but if you’re ready to apologize for what you said, I’m ready to hear it”
😆 I'm ready to be forgiven where you at Chris?!!!
I forgive you, Will. I'm just hoping Chris does too.
Shocked that the whole comment section is negative.
Love you Will! we all do stupid things❤️
if he was really sorry he could have posted this on twitter instead of youtube that way he wont be making any money of it
I used to love his movies, not anymore. So unprofessional
Oh god
How did Will suddenly make this about HIS “trauma” 💀💀💀 sit down
And all opponents are Toxic
too late
Man, I support you. You defended your wife's dignity!
I would see how all the haters would have acted in the place of this person
You know what will. As a long time fan I forgive you.  You are human and in that moment your mind was over taken by a spirit you could not control. My prayers are with you ask the Most High for help in your walk.
P.S. - Hope the Books doing well 😒
Bro it's fake I knew it it's fake i knew I knew it's 0:01 listen to lady voice
i wish i could see the amount of dislikes this video has
Awww, that’s hot...
Will Smith is thinking of creating a podcast  if this goes successful 😉
Beta cuk cnt
I love this man. Definitely human. Came back with it sooner than most at his level would have
primitive
I have a extension that tells me how many dislikes the video has and the video has 213k dislikes and only 106k likes lol
"I spent 3 months replaying and understanding the nuances and complexities of what happened."  Gtfoh you spent 3 months realizing you fucked up and trying to think of an apology.. yet this is what you came up with
Deleting comments I see...
Lmfao. This is why celebrities are faker then their characters they play
Will the goat no cap the world sensitive😂💪
It's morphing time...err, apologizing time I meant.
the reason it took him so long to make an apology he was watching logan pauls apollogy and trained it
Bro is crying about it after 4 months lol
La mejor manera de sanar, es soltar. Suelta el pasado, suelta lo que te hace daño (personas, amistades, situaciones). Sé feliz sin tanta mierda. En la simplicidad encontrarás refugio.
Strange apology. And who placed that plate on the bookshelf behind his head? That was weird.
Can u make a mistake? Isn’t a mistake something that happens just happens by accident and not by choice or chance?  Well , I really think that by saying “ you made a ______”,,, is you actually made an choice, thoughtfully and then went through with the choice.   So yah I do not believe that any person can  actually and factually state “ I made a mistake “.   What happened was , you actually made a bad choice.  In which You some how claim to have trauma from?!! what about Chris’s trauma? Embarrassment? Pain? Shock? Stress?   I think you really need to humble yourself .
Will, I have missed you. You are genuinely beautiful in so many ways and living in the famed life can’t always be the easiest.
10/10 👋👋👋
Girl what is this?! You really had a set built with studio lighting, professional audio and some serious dramatic cinematography?! Not only that, you hired an entire film crew to record you from multiple angles?! This is the most insincere thing I’ve ever seen. This is the time to get vulnerable and really express how sorry you are, (IF you’re even sorry at all, which I doubt) .. at this point it would feel more believable if you pulled out your iPhone and recorded this while takin a sh*t.   This is almost as cringy as Laura Lee’s apology. Almost
That was patheticville
As a kid, Will Smith was a hero but now as an adult, he's just pathetic.
why does this even deserve its own apology video its not even really his fault lmaoo
Bro ,why didn't you use your brain during that time? I swear I'm more angered than Chris
Will I’m Sorry my guy but the fact that your going to get paid from these views is not genuine can’t respect this once you got that message that he wasn’t ready you wait until He is not force it and reap benefits from YouTube’s monetization.
Used to be a fan, but not so much anymore.
Man almost mastered the YouTuber “apology” Nice! You forgot to add the stroking the cat though.
W will dawg fr
Why tf he talking like Barack Obama
Wearing his own merchandise in an apology video. Lol. Shameless plug!
This isn't an apology this is a plea to let him back into making movies. He gonna do original movies for Crackle Now
This is hard to take seriously due to will smith saying the this, fellow memers can agree right?
Will Smith really said “it’s apologin time”
Thank you for coming out to apologize for him and  you we all go through it sometimes but the right thing is to apologize
i respect that he didn't  turn off comments
He looks demented
I'm not saying this was a disingenuous apology. I'm sure it did come from a place of genuine sincerity to some extent. But there's no denying that Will Smith is such an "actor" that it's impossible to not see him playing a role when I watch this. I feel like I'm watching a man play a part *because* of how Will conducts himself and his presence as a person. It's exactly how I'd imagine Will Smith, the actor, apologizing publically.
Will Smith needs to remove himself from society, live in the woods and find his balls. Cuz right now he got none.
What the hell was this lol
Will looking good man
why does he actually sound like he has a gun to his head lmao
supe que iba a ser malo en el momento en que abrió la boca
So much negativity in the comments. None of y’all would say this to the man’s face smh. I’m not defending his actions but I’m disgusted with people spewing hate meanwhile I’m sure y’all have done things you regret that were not televised around the world. I know for damn sure I’m not perfect. I pray that we find forgiveness in our hearts and become a more understanding society. I choose love ❤️
lol you should just say "i fucked up"
We are all so over him at this moment.
Plot twist: This was recorded a day after that incident
Jada's remaining hair is not gonna be happy with this
Also hy can't you read?
Noone cares mate. Your careers ruined just fade off into the sunset
Love you will. X
TRAVIS SCOTT IS THAT YOU
This sounds like a job interview.
Did your dog step on a bee Will?
Love u Will!!!!
she does NOT have alopecia.
Weirdo
This was not an apology it is a q&a
"105K likes? That's strange..."  _(gets the plug-in)_  "212K dislikes... *yeah, that's the stuff* ."
Good job Will!
This is the most apology ever

the production is what gets me
Will I think everyone has done something that they regret.  Forgive yourself and let it go.  You have done many good things in your life and this one incident does not take that away.
Who else is here for the comments? 😂
this is why we need the dislike button! 😬
Admirable, respectable. Forgiven? In due time. Really the only best he could've done at this point was make this video and I think it goes a long way towards rebuilding trust and confidence for Will as well as everyone else involved. While outrageous and morally questionable this certainly was not an unforgivable act.
we love you....you're just a human being, and we all make mistakes .....from senegal with. love
Will Smith. I'd say use the money you still have right now and pay for your education. Get a masters degree and work. You will still have alot of money and you will gain alot still. Most ppl fall into obscurity when they spend their money without investing in themselves.
Hey look. It’s an actor doing what he does best… ACTING!
This isn't sincere, and he's only speaking about it again because it's hurt his pockets.
See you when this becomes a meme
it’s between will & Chris. Let’s just leave it like that. Everyone who’s commenting on the sincerity of his apology need to do something better with their lives. This didn’t affect any of you guys the way it has affected will and Chris. So like I said… leave it between them.
I hope they find forgiveness for you. Nothing but loveee 💗💗💗🥰
"Quick! Get the apology video out so that I can make money off of YouTube's preferential treatment of millionaire celebrities again!"
anyone else would be in prison...... just go away, retire....
they hired a camera man for this.
Try harder
Will, you've always been a motivator whether it was the character you played in a movie or as in the Fresh Prince. This would have been one of those Uncle Phil moments, but you always made things right. You gotta bring light, love and joy into your own life right now and see this toxicity is bringing you down. You're a good man. A smart man. Find the love you deserve man! You're being held short in a negative relationship, but I belive you'll find the right path. You got this man, and I'll still be supporting you.
No podés usar una gorra en un video de disculpas, es como ir a un velorio con ojotas y bermudas.
Hell nah he took this long to apologize on camera nah
There's a slight smile when he's apologising to Chris... Hope Chris can forgive him though
I mean the guy can’t win, you guys said there was no excuse yet he can’t apologise without it being fake. Great way to have double standards
Umm.... No
We all love you will. Stay good
Yeah no. You just need money. Hence this video.
Welcome to Morocco 🇲🇦
this ENTIRE video is cap .
for anyone wondering how many dislikes there are. its currently 105k likes to 212k dislikes
I Feel I Grew up with Him, watching Fresh Prince everyday with My big Bro! Watching Every Movie He put out, FR He was my “First Action Figure(MIB)” I can Remember having when I was 4!😆   I’ll ALWAYS be a Huge Fan of WillS and I PRAY He Finds Jesus in All The Chaos so 1 Day I can Meet Him and See Him Really Living and Happy! 😌
Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
If we want forgiveness and compassion from our Lord, the Almighty, then we should also at least try to forgive each other, we are all just human beings, we are all sinners.
Why, after watching this, I feel like he is not sorry for doing it, he is sorry for all the repercussion that came after doing it?
Lame
HAHAHAHAHA
"Nuances and complexities of that moment?" Lmaaao. It's actually simple. You reacted without thinking, you f***** up, it hurt other people, and it hurt your career. That's all.
solid hat and book plug
I think as a christian myself who tries to follow what Jesus taught, we are to forgive and extend mercy and compassion to others. Especially when they own up to it....and even when they don't.  Maybe a little late but sometimes anger takes a bit of work to get passed. I forgive him and think others should as well. Lets give eachother grace rather than constant judgment.
These comments are depressing 😕 😔.  There is no room for people to be Human in this world. Wow!
Esoteric destroyed more than it build in you
We still love you Will you have massively inspired me in my career God bless you sir, I look forward to meeting you and working with you one day, Your book is amazing too ❤
I honestly dont think he needed to apologize I completly understand and the people that said they were "Traumatized". From this it was simply just people wanting atention and using will smith for it.
The only people that should/shouldn’t forgive will is everyone he apologizing too .
fortnite
Why do people do this apology videos? Have you ever seen a successful apology video? The situation was dying off, but bro decided to bring it back.
None of this helps with inflation, crime, war, illness, depression, unemployment, social injustice, food insufficiency, educational access or civil unrest.
My web extension says this video has 211k dislikes.
This video is about as sincere as Amazon's Rings of Power trailers.
Will is a respectful guy since day one we knew him whilechris has always been that bullying annoying charcter to gets the worst out others respect to you Will that you still apologized for Just defending your woman's dignity and emotions
Haha they are deleting comments 😅
Proof turds don't float forever.
This is not about Chris...
Will, the only person you have to answer to is God! You don’t need our approval. I’m sure no one else on this thread has sinned or made a mistake so they can throw stones. God knows your heart. It happens, we sin differently, fall short, ask God for forgiveness then repent. Keep doing you. I love you and pray you, Chris and the families are able to move forward. All the best ❤️
it’s morbin time .... wait wrong video
He’s black logan paul
i hate this apology. it’s so bad. these are our society’s supposed role models?
Good man... all people make mistakes
I think it's time to write a new book Will!
how is this man not in jail?
7
This apology video is a bit late..
My favorite part is when Will said “it’s apologizin time” and then apologized the entire room
When you say I apologize, somewhere you are a man coming back to a real man.
Will Will Smith Smith? Will smith Will smith! Get the anvil out
Cant take him serious with a wario world hat on
Yuuuughh it’s rewind time
everyone makes mistakes and should be forgiven we shouldn’t hate someone because others hate them that’s why our world is at war.
This new morbius trailer is kinda hype.
Soooo..... Turns out Will cant act for sheeeet then? 🤔 🤣
THIS is why youtube took away the 👎 button so Corporate shills and sponsors of ad revenue CANT get bad publicity.  Even when youtube uses all the algorithms in the world WE still run BarterTown! 😂 🤣
will be like ITS REWIND TIME
Disliked
Gotta love those ads telling me to shop at the "will smith store" below the vid.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽✌🏾👌🏾
Wish Youtube still showed the number of dislikes... use this as a dislike button.
The like to dislike ratio says it all.  Why is he doing this now?  Is there a new movie to promote?
105k to 211k    as of right now .
Looks like Will is seeing potential opportunities go down the drain and is scrambling to do damage control. What a scumbag. He also completely overshadowed his win because no one is or will be talking about that in the future. They’ll only be talking about his obviously bad temper.
Come on Will. You got a lot of resources. Get some people who want to help you. You’ve been making numerous mistakes. Talk to your PR or something. Still find it funny you said “sorry” to your family but you “apologize” to Chris and his mom. I think this video is another mistake. Smh. I hope you get people around you to help you honestly.
strategically placed, water bottle brand his son owns. Wow. Gross.
I think I choose answer #1. 0:32-2:45
William' only apologise if you truly feel it in your heart, not because you feel the pressure to do so..you talk so much about Authenticity practice what you preach mate 👍
Too little too late doesn't seem genuine seems you still feel justified for what you did just thought it would be forgotten and have no choice want to repair your persona and career...
I looked up to will Smith like he was my hero since I was a kid. Can't say anything more than you gotta mean the apology for it to matter and I'm disappointed. You can make mistakes and be human, but in return you need to make it right. Not BS an apology video man.
This is so robotic, narcissistic, disingenuous, and frankly….crappy.  REALLY is this the best that you could do Bruh?  Is this the best that your PR team could contrive.  You should fire them all, drop out of the limelight, and get in touch with being a decent and genuine human being.    #shouldakeptthistoyourself
We love you Will, one mistake does not make you evil. You are LEGEND!!! ❤❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Good thing you're keeping Jada's boyfriend occupied. You needed that younger, more virile, woman pleasing, non-psycotic angle to do the proper YouTuber apology video.
Sending you so much love ♥️♥️♥️
Get rid of her
Weak
Why didn't I like this video of the Will Smith apology?   I was fogged our by that point.  'Shakss head'
105k likes 210k dislikes. To see dislikes their is an app called show dislike. It has the thumbs down picture and a red background. You have to paste this video address into the app same as if you were using YouTube to mp3
"I'm human and I made a mistake..." Yes, and you didn't go to jail for it because you're a celebrity.
How does an apology turn around and become about you again?
tha apology has to be as loud as tha disrespect...
too late I really love you as person and actor but after that thing never and this video just show you more bad because you want to get back your money and respect never gona happend this make it so worser because it needs to be done in that night.
Just retire
Don’t let people give sh1t to you from a mistake… will is humble and kind a mistake doesn’t make him a bad person.

Y'all have NO IDEA what it's like in his world. The apology is there for people to decide if they want to accept it, not for your comments to try to make the man feel worse. People mess up, and HE IS HUMAN, Will CANNOT go back in time and change that. All that can be done is an apology. In between when the incident occurred and this video a lot may have happened. Things we don't know. Up until the incident Will has always been deemed as genuine, but for some reason this time he isn't? All love this way for both parties in the incident.
Lol! This video didnt do good to you dude. Take your phone, walk somewhere, stand in the middle of nowhere and make a video, a real one, and let everything go.
Why does he sound like he’s never heard the English language before when he reads the first question
Heard a rumor Will is the next Black Panther. Too funny. It’s clear Marvel truly wants to lose most their fan base with nearly every choice since Endgame.
Les français vous êtes où ??
Booooo!! Pathetic!!
Yes, apologizing while acting like the victim makes it super sincere. NOT. This dude is trippin if he thinks this is an actual good apology. Who tf approved this?
Will might play the calm, cool , collected type in movies but he is definitely NOT that guy irl...  yikes
this man really dodged the first question he said lmao
Will neck is smooth  no wrinkles  this is crazy.
Me Me Me.
Nah
This hurts me as a big will smith fan. Watched almost all his movies, fresh prince, and read his book. He needs some help.
Cut the BS Will. Your wave DID trigger your action by rolling her eyes and giving you that look. That is more then a thousand words, so even if she did not say anything with words, she still did! She is just toxic and everyone seeing her behavior can tell. Just leave her already and free yourseld from that toxic relationship so you finally have REALLY space to go on a healing and growing journey. There was never a better time for this than now. 🙏🏽
You should want to apologize, to him, to his family, to everybody, but this ain’t it.
Понять и простить , Держись Уилл 👍
This is like travis scott apology but less worse
So none of us has ever done something in a moment of blind anger that we wish we could take back? Pleeez. We’re just lucky the cameras weren’t rolling.
This is about as genuine as jadas wedding vows
where is that's how we do it jaydens apology
“Disappointing people is my central trauma” come on mate, get a grip
Performance of a Lifetime..
Just couldn’t bring yourself to say the words you needed to apologize, eh Will? Had to put that in writing at the beginning, did you? How genuine. How heartfelt. You NEED to be ashamed of yourself, because what you did was absolutely shameful. All of your FANS were and ARE ashamed of you, what makes you think you’re better than shame?  I respect you as an actor, but as a person, you are the absolute dregs.  SO disappointed in this. 😔
There's very few wrongs in this world that you can't come back from. He was wrong in what he did. But he is human. And he made a mistake. We all make mistakes. And we all deserve opportunities to recover from our mistakes.
can't wait for the Will Smith Amber Heard comeback tour
Just leave the crazy witch, notice how Will’s voice went to a higher pitch when he said it wasn’t her that pushed him to do it. He has no confidence in what he’s saying because it is not the truth
🤡 Apology your career is over.
We love you Will!!
Anyone else notice how he did say Chris in 0:58? Or am I wrong?
Man, you guys are just🤦🏾‍♂️
201K dislikes!!
no sry will, I dont believe this is the truth. ur in a toxic relationship and its time to realise that. i can see ur not happy brotherman,hope u find the right path.  <3
🤦🏽‍♂️
Has Chris apologized for his behaviour too? I do not think so.  So why apologize? His behaviour was disgusting.
It's been months.... Take the paper on which the script of this video is written roll that piece of paper and shove it inside a body part I won't describe (because I used to have respect for you)
BE ASHAMED!! IT'S OKAY! YOU SHOULD BE!
Free will!!!! He’s done wayyy more good then bad in this world!
As genuine as a Chinese handbag
Manchurian Candidate Vibes
Pleassseee don’t smack meee!!11!1!11 😥😥😓
Wow 209.000 thumbs down! Will your are not sincere.
The sound of his voice… it’s okay bro
I hope he gets his balls back someday.
Unsubscribe untill he divorces the witch
Forget the haters. I still support Will.
WHY don't you apologize by going to Ukraine and helping the people in desperate need there. I would believe and accept your apology then. And we can start fresh.
Three months to give an apology. This is just sad.
No body is perfect and everyone has fucked up a time or two ......or STILL. He's only human. This world is so sad
Questlove was in the house.
And the Raspberry for Worst Apology by an Actor goes to........Will Smith in "Apologizin' Time in Victimland."
Bruh chain
He has more respect to Chris’s brother than Chris
Not getting nominated for this performance.
Yah
It sounds like you're trying to act sincere??  Coming from one of the highest tier actors in Hollywood, the pacing of what I can only assume is being read from a teleprompter... umm, swing and a miss?
He sounds like he’s lost his will smith to live
The way the just advertised water lmao this is all terrible.
I feel like this didn't need to happen.
The non-pology is just as bad as AH"Telling the Truth" you might be a good actor, Like AH it is too easy to read your body language! (Anyone that was worked on the front lines of Retail between 3 - 9 years, it becomes easy to read people)
The only thing you should have said, "I am sorry, I was wrong, please forgive me". That's all.
He's human, Chris and Will have history and he got fired up in the moment and lost control. It happens to everybody, but the majority of people don't ever apologize. The main issue is he's a big name in the spotlight, not a normal every day person, so he will never be able to get away from the situation no matter what he does.
There are no nuances or complexities you acted a fool
Notice how many times he says “I” in this video ..that says EVERYTHING
This apology on camera looks  like reality TV entertainment. You're still playing for the crowd Mr Entertainer. Start to fix your ego and perhaps it will translate in how you occur in your professional life. This fumbling slice of PR isn't what your lost soul should be engaging. Chris was (deeply) wronged and a televised apology is just hot breeze for likes.   You're still flexing for the wrong reason. Good Luck finding yourSelf through this journey tho. You're not a bad man but you did fall off your own moral high horse by your own hand. Work on processing your own emotions before you try to fix you and bring the rest of us into this.    You're not a bad man.
I can see the hurt in his eyes. Will was out of character not giving him a pass for his actions, I'm just pointing out the fact we know this IS NOT him. This past year has been stressful to him. I will keep Chris and Will in my prayers. I pray these brothers come back together as grown men and repair this relationship and move on. We are our brothers keeper. Will you also need counseling because your eyes as you said quest's eyes are really sad. I Love you brother
I thought this was a good start 🙏 Thanks Will for stepping up and trying to take ownership for your actions.
Dude, I still believe you did everything right. The funker should have known his limits. In the USA, perhaps, you could sue him for you-know-what
Letting people down isn’t your trauma, not being able to use those people to do your narcissistic supply gathering is your trauma
Poor baby!! 😂😆😂😂😂😂😂😆😂😂 🙄
great acting but you should save it for the movies
You know you're about to hear 5 minutes of PR speak when he opens the video with a YouTuber Sigh™️
Great performance, great cinematography, great screenplay, great editing. Overall, I like it.
I thought he was gonna fart in the beginning with that huge sigh.
Dude is deadass reading from a screen or something
Use my like button for this video dislike button
I want to apologize for ever liking this guy as an actor this is the worst preformance I’ve ever seen.
Now you are a real youtuber, try making some rap cover videos. It will make some views
Thank you Mr. Smith. That was remarkable. I know it was hard but we are praying for you and looking forward to year to come of laughter and entertainment. Bless you sir.
...And this is exactly the sort of thing for which youtube tried to hide the dislikes.
Haha YouTube, we can still see the dislikes. 105K likes, 208K dislikes.
I'm happy he has a quick reason to promote his merch and water
Why didn’t you apologize to Chris in your acceptance speech?  “I was fogged out.”  Bruh, you apologized to the Academy in your speech.
105k likes to 209k dislikes I am going to laugh.
You fucked up man, you were my hero
bro having a dramatic intro 💀
When he said "To hell with him! How come she don't want me, man?" 😭
GO AWAY!!!
Can't believe the black guy from YouTube Rewind who said this is hot did a very naughty thing. Never meet your heroes.
Le public vous à toujours vu dans des rôles qui vous montres , comme quelqu'un ayant des valeurs spirituelles puissantes et fortes , et on vous voit faire ce geste envers un Noire moins costaud que vous en publics , c'était humiliant pour Lui , sur le moment , mais sur le long terme c'est vous qui  subissez l'humiliation , et la plupart de vos films ne sont plus exploitable , ni regardable .
Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic
Master Class on how Not to apologize and take responsibility.
I'm probably going to bangers and mash for my dinner.
These comments are disgusting…
I think I am more sorry that I watched this than he is of his actions.
Will, quit trying to gaslight me.  I know what I saw and I know how it made me feel about you. You can use big words and slow speech all you want, it doesn’t change what YOU did that night.
I'm pretty sure they're a lot of people who think this apology video is just a piece of meaningless act, yet the same people were complaining about why didn't Will Smith came out and apologize in the last few months. Well hey, people are here to judge and unfortunately we live in a world where popular opinions win, regardless if it's right or wrong:)
Arriba will animo desde españa
Wow dude….. just wow.. what kind of apology is this?? “Heartfelt”??🤣🤣🤣🤣
nope...
Lol Will use to be a cool guy but it’s clear he let fam get to him.
congratulations will, now you are officialy a youtuber
I am deeply remorseful you dont think you need to be ashamed of yourself. In that moment you did ACT like a POS. I love you Will, but just say your sorry and LEAVE it there! The apology should of been done a long time ago in private. I really hope you guys get to a good place, but this public apology is falling deaf ears.
Will is serving a life sentence with a narcissistic. He will never escape.
Hey Tosh, here's web redemption material right here. Make an actual apology for Will
Man he is so great at acting that even his apology almost got me fooled.
You got me at apologin
POV:  me at 6 years old after biting a classmate for them drawing on my drawing.  My teacher in the back, watching: I just made a friendship! Lesssgo!
Update, the video now has 207k dislikes
Wow. People really live to crucify people for being people. Flawed. Nothing this man says or does will make a difference because it's too delicious that he's not perfect.  His embarrassment is too satisfying to people who crave the condemnation of others. Everybody's an expert on the perfect apology now. Just let it go! Everybody in this feed, and everyone who saw what happened, has done worse or the same! Yet and still....such hypocrisy.
I could have probably made a more empathetic and genuine “apology” video from my phone, at my desk, in my apartment…
Brave to leave these comments on chief
Aún niega que él se podría comportar así, pero se comportó así y justifica al calor del momento. Sigue sin entender él mismo el porqué de su reacción....
ITS SLAPPIN TIME. no. ITS APOLOGISING TIME.  . . . . . . That's hot.
Is he really trying to get out of what he did by talking about himself? If he was a real man, he should have left when the Academy asked him too. Instead he said no, like a little kid. Personally I don't think he deserved the best actor award at all. He showed his true colors that night. I will never watch anything Will Smith does again! He needs to be straight with people, as I personally don't by this scripted PR apology.
Sounds like he’s reading
I hope Will spends the next 5 to 8 years studying the relationship between the Covert Narcissist and the Unaware Empath.  I feel this apology was genuine. Also, his movie  ' The Pursuit of Happyness ' really helped me through a rough patch... that and Tom Petty's album Wildflowers.
Its been a year daddy💀
Alot of people forgive, alot of people don't. And that's fine I guess. We don't decide if he's ok to move on from this, that's up to Chris. I just don't feel comfortable with having a role model and childhood idol of mine getting clowned on the internet. It also isn't comfortable to look at him the same way I did before. I just hope this situation just fades away in time. Power to Will and more power to Chris.
never much of a fan of this guy, haven't seen one of his movies since independence day. but now i like him even less. current dislike count - 207K
For such a great actor…
Bro you did wrong, you're paying for it, you've showed remorse and you've also apologized for it. If they want more than that then phuck them.... point blank
Will, that was a good apologetic video. You just made a mistake because you're only human. Well done for acknowledging your mistake and being humble enough to apologise to Chris and everyone you let down. Its time for you to cheer up now and leave this incident in the past.
Video has 66% dislikes. (Vanced user)
🤣🤣🤣 I give this guy props for not disabling the comment section lol.
Bunch of bull
Was this about the YouTube Rewind video.. about time.
His agent like: Don’t forget to put the bottle of water you invested in. 😂😂 this whole apology seems legit.
Will if you want your life to get better leave that DEMON you married. Toxicity is something you can't see when you're in it. Run brother save yourself.
I am laughing at the Narcissists (Insert Will Smith Here) that predictably are only capable of surviving, emotionally, by feeding their negative energy using the energy of those all too trusting and innocent around them. People: Stop voting for Narcissists and stop elevating the fake woke pretenders in Hollywood as roll models.  🚯 Will Smith: Move on and start surrounding yourself with normal people not other Narcissists! 😂 🤡
The most interesting part is at 2:55. When he is asked that question, his voice gets more shaky, almost like he’s tearing up. There’s some cuts in the video as well, so he couldn’t have done it in one take.
So much hate in these comments. If all of our mess ups were broadcast to the world I’m sure we would want some grace. I hope Chris and Will can one day make peace with this. I’m glad Will apologized again. He was 100% wrong but I don’t think that one moment should define his otherwise incredible career. I hope we all can get better at forgiving people.
The only thing I could say he did wrong is no dog, but besides that, perfect apology video. Checks all the boxes.
Will, I think you're a terrific man, and we will always be friends. I watched you grow up and I'm speaking to you as if you were my son. The recent events did not change that. You are a human being, and you were under extreme stress and pressure. I just hope that you are taking care of yourself now and making sure that you get what you need in life. When we give all we have and all we are to others, we don't leave anything for ourselves, and many times we don't get anything from the ones we pour ourselves into. Take care of yourself.
snoozefest
can anyone tell me why he sorry for this fact?😃 he do right everything, cris one to apologize, bot will... usa really degraded like that?😃 i never respect will... he facked his name.
That sigh at the beginning lmao
Wait, I think I’ve seen this before… On The Boys… The Deep Apology video in the latest season.
Product placement of his son's water brand is amazing. Never touched, never moved, right in the center of the table, logo facing just askew of the camera so it looks like it wasn't intentionally put there. Marketing team did their homework! This is about a C-tier cringe YouTube apology imo. Could have been D but he never actually said I'm sorry so it'll stay at a C in my books.
this is not an apology.
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
When you opened the comment section, you have to embrace the backlash Will hha
People spend so much time in others people's business loll
holy crap! someone mentioned he was pimping out brands and it was recorded. the freakin mic new to him! and the whole place is WF. and angle moving…all this new movie he'ii be in…now I complicate if I watch. the forced  this apology or couldn't get the part
It hasn't been a minute, its been months. If the justice system still worked, you'd have been arrested. If police and prosecutors had balls, it would have happened live as a much needed example!
Will kinda showed that he can’t be counted on to be respectful in public so why would Chris want to talk to him in private where there is no mediation to hold him accountable.
It's nice to have you finally apologize to Chris for your very bad behavior.  This is a good start.  You need to leave the Succubus you are married to before she drives you to doing something like this again.  You can do better, and you deserve better.
Watch Andrew Tate, Willy Smith.
Sorry Will. I hope things get better. Stuff like this is never easy especially when you have millions of ppl watching and getting involved. Keep your head up.
I want to see the dislikes. I want Will Smith to show the dislikes.
you are human Will, accept it 🤷🏾‍♀️and your still f’ng amazing, accept that too! YES 🙌🏾 they can both reside in the same space, they have to
you need a hug from uncle phill boi
Personally I *want* to believe his apology just because I would rather he be back in movies than not!
He's such a disappointment.
“Not the optimal way and I would never do that” after he did it
great speech, who wrote it? Your wife's boyfriend?
the amount of hate comments is insane , I have yet to find one that isn't saying "he doesn't mean it" or " terrible apology"
The dude fucked up, and now he apologized. We should move on.
This isn't an apology, its just an advertisement for Smith.  Quit playing a victim Will, nothing but a Hollywood sell out, this shouldn't be public Smith just looking to salvage his image.  Great acting on the apology tho lol
Last I heard from Jaden: That’s how we do it! 🤔
Try to be more serious next time
...wow did you fr just wait 4 whole months to make a clearly fake apology video just to "apologize" to chris when you could've done it waaaay before 💀
It's a long time, since I've watched something so fake. :) If you watch closely, you can still see that mr. Smith doesn't accept the fact he did something wrong. As he is stating an argument foul ad hominem "I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed, because I am only a human and I made a mistake" :D That's the thing mr. Smith. That "mistake" isn't something humans should ever do. You became an animal at that point. That's why all the hate. Hopefully he gets the message and will become human again. :) <3
You can't go back, it's over.
You're are an outcast now, this is what you need to accept.
Will go to Jesus ok he forgives u will be ok because I will lift u up in prayer 🙏 we all make mistakes
You should be in prison. You got lucky so be thankful you're not behind bars. You're rejected because nobody wants people like you in society. It's deep in people's soul to quickly move away from that type of behavior. Do you understand?
Will isn’t looking for acceptance from Chris Will wants acceptance from his fans
Woke up this morning like, "I'd REALLY love to watch 5 minutes and 44 second of absolute cringe today." Gotta say, this was... (chef's kiss)
Jesus can change your life ❤️✝️
"I want to apologize" and still doesn't know how to apologize.
Just came here to dislike the video. This apology is just damage control BS.
All these sarcastic comments are so boringly dusty. Forgiveness is a choice but also a chance.
When it takes you five months to apologize and not even say “I’m sorry”, you’ve got a problem
Honestly wish I could see the dislikes
HE IS RLLY A GOOD ACTOR
😂😂😂 the dislike ratio is immaculate
also he says he is fuzzy cant remember then he says he went over it for the last 3 months so which is it?
Awww, these hollywood celebrities are so honest! I bet their carbon footprints are also very good!
couldnt even say the words im sorry chris
Can't wait for his next movie: "Cuck-Panther & the Prince of Hot Air"
Mandatory apology video-breathing 0:11
Went from a great actor to a bum human.
Of all the apology videos I've seen, this is the one that has Will Smith in it
Love you Will, we all make mistakes! I’m glad you are back. Stay strong and make more movies. I would love to see a movie about Mansa Musa, the Emperor of the Mali empire. We need you in the game to tell our stories! Love you big brother from another mother!❤️
@Will - don't make it worse with a fake apology. If you were really sorry it wouldn't take 3 months. You clearly assessed the fallout from this and worked with strategists to conjure this video.   10 years ago it would have flown but the Internet never forgets. But it does forgive if you do it right. But you didn't and now your a laughing stock bro.
Lol, gtfo with this fake crap!
missing the dislike counter rn
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.   (1 Thessalonians 5:6) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
Unpopular opinion; this seems genuine, he just seems extremely uncomfortable.
Don't ask me how but I can see dislikes and so far it's 206K dislikes
Thank you for being human, I still love you Will!!!
I’d respect him if he didn’t apologise.
You waited too long. Feels like milking the attention at this point. We stopped caring
Just fade away with a tiny shred of dignity....and take Medusa and your weird spawn with you. Byyyeeeee :)
Acting
Here before PewDiePie makes a review of this apology video
Bro just get on with it
4 months just to make this measly apology?  It’s just words.  How about instead of this, show true sincerity by doing something about what you started?  Crazies have attacked comedians on stage because they were inspired by you.  True actions over empty words is needed.
Is there a level below having no respect for Will?
Well done Will. I think most of us have regrets that we wish could go back and change.
Who is in a worse spot right now him or amber heard
Well at least he recognised it was the wrong way to handle the situation.
such a preaty fake apology mr.Smith, well done , still the good actor... Only one thing was true, UNEXEPTEBLE!
LOL The damage is done my friend
your woif is in me dms HEY BABY!
His wife's boyfriend must of wrote the script
Just take your money and go away.
He did everything right.
Will needs a 7 Pounds redux but for real
why it sound like ai
I think it’s been more than a minute
This isn't an apology to Chris as much as it is you starting your apology tour in order to get back to work. If you were really sorry, you would have reached out to Chris and allowed him to move the ball forward publicly before making this video. A real apology would have been, like this "Chris, my action on that night was inexcusable. I allowed my emotions to get the better of me and for that, I am sorry. It is my hope that someday you find it within yourself to forgive me. I ruined a friendship that has lasted decades and all because I could not keep my emotions in check. I am sorry to you and your family and if you ever reach a point to where you would like to meet and air your grievance directly to me for what I did then I am at your disposal. To the media and fans, I will not address this again without Chris's consent as he is the true victim." Your Apology is transparent and obviously nothing more than an attempt to get back into the good graces of the public and Hollywood.
God help you will and now you have to learn the lessons ?
guys.. Will has been doing a lot of thinking and personnal work over the past few months... just like he did the last 3-4 years (?) according to his book... so, we can expect him to go to the next award show with an AK47... lmao
If you’re reading this keep going, don’t stop! One day you’ll be glad you didn’t💙
What is really disappointing is that immediately after the clip played an ad popped up suggesting that I purchase his book.  What???? I don't believe I was ever going to buy his book, but I now know that I really won't buy it .Why do people idolize these celebrities?  I don't get it.  Live your own life and stop trying to live vicariously through other people.
This apology is about as genuine ss Jadas alopecia
Arretes de t excuser c est une réaction humaine que tu as eu. Tu as défendu ta femme sur une blague vaseuse et méchante de ce tocard qui ne peut pas faire d humour sans attaquer sur les points sensibles des gens. Toute cette histoire et ton exclusion sont ahurissantes quand on voit qu on laisse venir des gens aux meurs douteux  Tu es un roi will et nous sommes beaucoup à te soutenir  Courage
really glad that chris is ignoring him
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
This apology video is as real as a flying unicorn!!! 😄💢
Moral of the story : don't make a mistake as celebrity. Even if you sincerely apologize, the internet won't accept it
Ngl I don’t think he should be getting this kind of hate bc he’s human and it’s normal to make mistakes.  If this were a random person they probably wouldn’t get this much hate. And we can’t forget all the good things he has done.
I think this apology video deserves an apology video because of how bad it is 💀 dude didn’t even say he was sorry to Chris yet. He apologized but didn’t say he was sorry.
hey! He didn't turn off the comments!, I didn't expect that
Dude... This is bad.
4 months later 💀but good on ya
This is soooo disingenuous 😳😳
Ulol!
It took him 3 months to apologize
👍You are Always the Best..a Good and Great Man and a Great Artist.Thanks Will you are an example for me since Thé Prince of Bel Air 🃏🃏👍👍👍🧑‍✈️🛫🌌🌠🛩️
Anger Management:  1. Think before you speak   In the heat of the moment, it's easy to say something you'll later regret. Take a few moments to collect your thoughts before saying anything. Also allow others involved in the situation to do the same.    2. Once you're calm, express your concerns  As soon as you're thinking clearly, express your frustration in an assertive but nonconfrontational way. State your concerns and needs clearly and directly, without hurting others or trying to control them.    3. Get some exercise  Physical activity can help reduce stress that can cause you to become angry. If you feel your anger escalating, go for a brisk walk or run. Or spend some time doing other enjoyable physical activities.    4. Take a timeout  Timeouts aren't just for kids. Give yourself short breaks during times of the day that tend to be stressful. A few moments of quiet time might help you feel better prepared to handle what's ahead without getting irritated or angry. 5. Identify possible solutions  Instead of focusing on what made you mad, work on resolving the issue at hand. Does your child's messy room make you upset? Close the door. Is your partner late for dinner every night? Schedule meals later in the evening. Or agree to eat on your own a few times a week. Also, understand that some things are simply out of your control. Try to be realistic about what you can and cannot change. Remind yourself that anger won't fix anything and might only make it worse. 6. Stick with 'I' statements  Criticizing or placing blame might only increase tension. Instead, use "I" statements to describe the problem. Be respectful and specific. For example, say, "I'm upset that you left the table without offering to help with the dishes" instead of "You never do any housework."    7. Don't hold a grudge  Forgiveness is a powerful tool. If you allow anger and other negative feelings to crowd out positive feelings, you might find yourself swallowed up by your own bitterness or sense of injustice. Forgiving someone who angered you might help you both learn from the situation and strengthen your relationship.    8. Use humor to release tension  Lightening up can help diffuse tension. Use humor to help you face what's making you angry and, possibly, any unrealistic expectations you have for how things should go. Avoid sarcasm, though — it can hurt feelings and make things worse.    9. Practice relaxation skills  When your temper flares, put relaxation skills to work. Practice deep-breathing exercises, imagine a relaxing scene, or repeat a calming word or phrase, such as "Take it easy." You might also listen to music, write in a journal or do a few yoga poses — whatever it takes to encourage relaxation.    10. Know when to seek help  Learning to control anger can be a challenge at times. Seek help for anger issues if your anger seems out of control, causes you to do things you regret or hurts those around you.
Since he has been a Hellywood actor since his teens I would of thought he could actually act this part but nope!😎
👎
Lies
Yarl should of just owned it and said you'd do it again then get into gangster rap
What he said about suffering psychologically and emotionally because he let people down..... Really got to me.  -- I can tell he really meant that , and I feel bad for him right now, he did make a mistake, but he's a human being and he deserves another chance......   I can see the hurt in his face when he said that...  --- I'm still a Will Smith fan....
When you realize this video is monetized😂😂😂🤡. Total clown show.
Everybody deserves a second chance… its time to move on. May he who has never sinned cast the first stone…
I wonder how the Like/Dislike bar would look like if the dislikes weren't disabled
Ah man I hate it so much when people feel ashamed!
I'm glad to see this video. I just don't have the issues others are having. Will, I believe you are remorseful. You did a really dumb thing which, unfortunately, the whole world witnessed. But, I believe in giving grace, because we all need grace from time to time. I'm glad that my poor choices aren't broadcast world wide. We all do stupid and/or bad things throughout our lives. I just don't think it's fair for one mistake to ruin someone's life/career. I don't know the details that brought him to that choice, nor do I need to. I'm satisfied. The rest is between him and Chris, and I hope they work that out quietly, between themselves. Now I'm just looking forward to Will's future work. Take care, man. 💖
BOOOOO! 👎
I had to see this video multiple times cause I was fogged out. Still waiting for the words “I’m Sorry”
Someone get him to watch Andrew tate. Will needs lessons on how to get his dignity back as a man
Wow, made it all about you
Will Smith sounds like a president saying a speech on TV. Fake!!!
203k dislikes vs 104k lmao
Divvy
I can smell the entire PR team in the background, bro!
We haven't stopped being friends Will, we love you. We all make mistake, learn and grow and hopefully do better. That's exactly what life is about right?
What a coincidence. For four months Will Smith couldn’t be bothered to say a thing about this, until he gets a $30 million movie advance. Now all the sudden he’s coming out talking about how he’s sorry. Seems the movie studio is making him do this just to try to head off bad PR for the upcoming movie.   And maybe if you really meant it he wouldn’t have had a multi shot film crew on hand to do it for him.  If he actually meant it he would’ve made this apology about four months ago. Not waited until he got a movie deal to do it.
Seems like the only thing you can or should do is become a republican! At least you won't have to apologize to your followers fo things like that.
He could have apologized to Chris in private. This public video is to get out of negativity for himself. I just hope he is happy in life, i can see allot of sadness in his eyes.
You should fell ashamed
You have an awesome publicist.
Wow! Poor choice on top of poor choice
Trying to be remorseful without being ashamed... Shame serves a purpose, you should feel shame.
I just love how even after YouTube deactivated dislikes, people are still using it.
Too little to late. Also..you should have apologised to Chris, the public apology is the same as the PR stunt.
This apology is definitely one of the very one of millions of apologies made a day
I don´t hate him, but the fact that his Water Brand is right next to him at the beginning, gives me some concerns.
piyan
👏🏽❤
Pitiful!
Damned if you do, damned if you don’t
No genuine at all. This was for your career, not for Chris. If this was a real apology it would have been done months ago and privately.
SUGE "THE SYMPATHY SEEKER" SMITH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just an update for all you that can't see the dislikes. as of Aug 2nd this video is at 202k dislikes.
"im here whenever youre ready to talk" ..... A subtle but noticeable attempt to shift responsibility to the victim SMH
Why the massive production? It should have firstly been done in private with Chris and then with Chris's permission a video. An apology video with just Will and a iPhone, not a production team!
This comment most likely is never going to reach Will, but it needs to be said.  Will, you where the no 1. celebrity boys role model at my school (south west Norway), You did it all, and did it (to our eyes) well. Now there seems to be nothing more than a husk left of what you presented as in the music and media you were apart of. You claim to be doing "personal work" but both expressions of sadness and happiness seem deeply disconnected and performative,  you like every one else are allowed to be flawed. Stop what ever this is and please, reassert your identity, you and so many others could benefit from it.  (That said, it might have all been good acting that produced the spark in your eyes that so many saw, who knows.)
Too little, too late.
Why were you not arrested? Lack of evidence?
Had to pause the video right away so I can read these comments without dude getting a view from me 😂😂
"I want to apologize" and "I apologize"  can be very different
Y do you need a camera crew to do a video?
While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, keep in mind that you don't know how you would've responded in such a situation. Will is human as we all are and he deserves grace, understanding and compassion. I appreciate what he has done all throughout his career with the beginning of it while I was a young teenager. You know what they say, sometimes there's a breakdown just before a breakthrough. You will recover Will. Continue to be great and careless about all these negative self-centered comments.
Fake af apology
Will smith 4 months after the incident : Yah its rewind time
You should make a movie with Amber Heard
This video has almost 200k dislikes.
I want to be clear. I apologize, but I am not sorry!
why his voice sound AI generated
Fresh Prince perfectly filmed behind that light bulb like he got a huge Halo over his head! Lol NP
Sounds like a genuine apology 🤥 .....NOT!
I thought you were preparing to the boxing match
I’m genuinely in shock with how shitty that was
Chris spat in the face of this fake apology and in the faces of all those who "accepted" his "apology".
Will Smith just undid 40 years of reputation but all that time he was hiding his true personality
Stfµ Willy! Just stfµ!!
You never lost a friend Will.
Lets Go🔥🔥 202K + Dislikes
yes
WTF??? What about the survivors of Tulsa???? What about the Till family????👎👎👎👎
Im just glad to see that he eventually apologized  As late as this was at least you apologized in general I guess better safe than sorry Full respect man 🫡🤜🤜✌️
😮🤤 - jadas face when his boyfriend was about to explode
FOH he prepared for this like this was a movie role. This ain’t genuine bro. He’s apologizing to us not Chris.
So…how many Minutes are there in 4 Months? 🤔💭
shame on your son saying , " thats what we do"
200k Dislike roflol😂😂😂😂
After 30 years i never knew Will had a underbite until now
What a great actor.
Mike LOWWWWRY
As much as the idiots in this comment section i understand but I can say he’s being honest here I can see it this video no tears which is better most idiotic apology videos cry this is faking it he handled it properly no acting is on the video he should be trying to avoid it mostly
Sick Wario hat.
Why dont you reach chris?? Instead of making video.
He sounds medicated.
Disgrace yikes
An apology from an entitled showbiz character who still feels that a part of the behavior he's apologizing for is right .
As a psychologist, one of my hobbies is character analysis of movie actors, I have to admit that Will, you are one of the best.  Undoubtedly, most of the viewers who saw your behavior in that event judged you or, at best, your behavior.  I believe your behavior was out of the ordinary, but I have this question to all the people who judged, what would you do if you were in that situation?  In the end, I am grateful for the apology you made and I value your apology a lot.  Now you are freed from that difficult situation.  Challenges can always be worthwhile if we turn them into opportunities.
"I'm sorry for losing movie contracts" -Will
You couldn't do it face to face Will with Chris instead of this vile way? C'mon man! I used to respect you so much!
There's really nothing like an honest and sincere apology...and this is really nothing like an honest and sincere apology. Next time, buddy, maybe not with the professional lighting, fake reads and multiple camera angles, yeah?
lmfao
Why did you say sorry to everyone else but Chris? To him you said "I apologize to you." Do you truly feel sorry for him or just did the apology out of necessity?
I feel like saying I apologize is tearing him apart, like there's a lot of angry in his tone when he says it. But of course he was paid in advance for a movie deal right? Gosh don't want that to flop, better apologize I guess. Give me a break.
Sounds fake
One of the apologies of all time.
I'm rolling with will through thick and thin
This is a fail. An epic fail, Will. 😂
This is so insincere. Just accept your penance and disappear for 5 years, then make a comeback. Talk about it and address your experience then. People used to know how to handle disgrace with a little grace. Hence the name. This was not grace. This was a plea for your redemption, ahead of peoples sensitivities. You will not be able to force it, nor repair it. You will have to let it play out. My two cents.
I was just looking for a video of this without the commentary, and came across this.
It's been months, man..
This is exactly the apology I'd expect from a scientologist.
Chris owes you nothing! Classic narcissist behavior to expect Chris to make amends when you’re family created this mess because you are experts at attention seeking and playing the victim. This apology stinks
Actors going to act!
Damn you remember to apologize? 😂
What about “I’m sorry Chris”? Your “I’m sorry uncle Phil” was more believable.
Scripted and fake.  When will people stop with the public apology videos, they are nothing but cya for financial/legal reasons anyways.  Also, when you are truly sorry you don't say "I apologize"....  Will needs to work this out privately with Chris, if that is even possible.  If they can settle, then the two can agree on a way for the situation can be announced publically.  Otherwise, I'd say it's over for Will.  He may have made a career-ending mistake that night.    also, dislikes are 2:1 in case ya'll didn't know.
Yes, you are responsible for your own actions, but you are also in a toxic relationship. It’s plane as day to anyone on the outside.
Ya basta! Debe dejar de humillarse, dar vuelta a la página y ya, no mató a nadie! esto es una exageración! Debería buscar ayuda para por fin divorciarse de esa mujer maltratadora y tóxica!
Wow! Can’t believe you and your spin team signed off on this bulls#%t!   Such a dumb mistake to go with this scripted “corporate”  vibe on an ugly soundstage with multiple cameras.   Plus, your eyes look “dead” in the scene. So much wrong with this whole thing.   Your narrative is much worse now — if that was even possible.    BYE WILL!
*i just want him to move on* *As well as everyone else*
Will can’t tell time.
I miss the old WIll
Will Smith: “My behavior was unacceptable…”  Also Will Smith: “Please forgive me and accept my behavior”
BETA LOL
What if this was satire
Celebs are lost in another world 😂 someone needs to bring these clowns back to earth and give their heads a wobble
104K likes, 199K dislikes
For both sides, either “you become wounded or wise. Choose wisdom and move on because you can’t change the past but create a better future!
Empty words... This is not an appology, this is only  Will Smith trying to save face.
I just hope Jada’s boyfriends made it through all of this ok.
He looks like he just came from golfing 💀
I don't know bro its serious topic but meme community get lot of from that award show   Life isn't straight be happy be taught that all i want say , seriously
😆
Let’s all just appreciate the fact that Will didn’t suspend comments on this video. 😂
Saved by the dislike button, else you would've surpassed Justin Bieber
Smashin’ that thumbs down button to help the algorithm to show the court jester to more people.
When he sat down, sighed and said "I ain't playing with you, K. Did you ever flashy-thing me?" I literally cried tears of joy
Truly an apology that exists and a video that was made and people watched
As someone who used to like you, I'm was kinda disappointed by your last actions... But this is a nail in your coffin. What a waste...  Ps: hey @Youtube, how does your "if we hide the dislikes, people will not dislike" theory works so far?
🙄
Typical lol
The Goat 🐐
You can never trust what a professional actor says because they can easily fabricate their emotions to appear genuine
YouTube should have never gotten rid of the number of dislikes.
Dude your done. This hast to be the worst apology video I’ve ever seen. And wtf was that apology to your family. You can do that in person not in a video like a jerk and it’s not about them. You committed a crime and really could have hurt him. SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
Cant we just move on bru
Nope. Not genuine. Rehearsed and there’s no evidence of self reflection
His fancy words about trauma drip wealthy privilege. I don't want to pile on what everybody else has already said but I don't think a human being really said anything; he's a dude reading a script, either one he wrote in his head or one provided to make sure he didn't say anything stupid. All he's missing is "end of quote, repeating the line" LOL
oooh what a ratio 198k dislikes so far
Would really like to see the dislike ratio.
Too little too late
Yawn 🥱
I forgive him, If I'm being honest
We all have a moment of madness......
It's all good man I still love watching ur movies but self discipline and control plays a major role, you're still great to me tho bro. To anyone reading,I doubt will will ever see this so leave this a like if you agree yeah?
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself."  FYI, remorseful is synonym for ashamed and you should be.   "I'm trying not to think of myself as a piece of sh##."  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck ...
You'd think he's a vet that had a dissociative event the way he talks about himself... this man is deeply disturbed
Bull. I guess his pocketbook is already hurting it needs to hurt for a long time and more than the 10 years that the academy put on him.
You were honest   best approach man
Will. You are doing the right thing now. This is why theres a bright light behind your head when you speak right into the camera. Amen to everyone who forgives, and everyone who apologize to make the world a better place. Amen!
If you're not gonna be sincere... why even make an apology video?
Is this the first A-list apology video? 😂😂🤡😂 where‘s that cozy sweater tho 💀😂
Pffffffttttt 🙄
the dislikes why
I pray that you come back soon😭💯✨
This is definitely one of the apology videos of all time
This is just pathetic....
When Will said “Sauron, I apologize.” I got so many goosebumps.
This is definitely a video
Reconciliation is a more powerful story. It all starts with, “would you forgive me?”
No it's been more than a minute, it's been months since the incident!
Just a minute?
missing them million dollar movie deals 🤣
This is so disingenuous! Will, you made this about you, when it should have been about Chris. You are not the victim, Chris is!
Still love you Will.
Gee thanks Will for this apology months later after the fact, im sure this was totally sincere and not fake at all
Yikes. Will, get away from that woman. She's ruining you, and deep down you know it.
We can see through you Will.  We know that your not genuine.
The only way he could make this better is to bring in a pet and fake cry. LMAO come on man you trained 4 months for this get it right.
BOY BYE! 🙄
lol
We don’t forgive you, move along.
日本だと、暴力はいけないことだけど、それでも病気の事について話したコメディアンが叩かれると思います 私も動画を見て、なんて酷いやつなんだ！って思ったし、妻のために立ち上がった貴方は素晴らしいと思いました  これからも妻を、家族を大事にしてくれる素敵な夫、父であってほしいです  遠い日本から応援しています 大好きです
Guy trying to look like a victim 🤦‍♂️
Will should make a masterclass at youtuber apologies he learned from the all time greats
Estoy de acuerdo con el hecho que, ningún tipo de violencia es aceptable y que el alcance de una agresión es aún más profunda que lo aparentemente superficial, pero en mi familia también tengo personas a quienes amo, y tienes algunas complicaciones de salud... Y si alguien tomara su estado de salud en broma y aún más en público, y peor enfrente de ellos y en frente mío!!!  creo que actuaría igual, porque es ¡mi familia!! Nunca he sido patrocinador de la agresión, en ningúna de sus formas, ni como maestro, ni como cristiano, y creo que así como ha sido juzgado @willsmith también debiese ser juzgado por la agresión y denigración que hizo, y hace el comediante, estoy seguro que Él comediante en zapatos de Will, quizás se hubiese quedado callado, pero hasta cuándo se permite que le humillen, denigren, lastimen, ... A su ser amado,!!! Por algo el actor y comediante no ha levantado ningún cargo, sabe bien que su acción, obtuvo una respuesta y que quizás la vuelva a tener por otros, el igual los demás comediantes que usan la "comedia" que humilla, como medio... Pero ¿No es eso también agresión? Y ellos siguen tan campantes cobrando ¿¿¿¡¡¡por humillar directamente!!!???
I Respect your attempt to own up to your action, one has to first forgive himself and then forgive others.  I once read pass mistakes are life lessons not life senteces, one has to always remember that everyone makes mistakes it's ashame that in your case it was public but you can not fault your self as you stated you are human and so is every one else once you forgive your self you can forgive others and others will forgive you! Stay Positive and keep your head up.  Time fixes everything...
Does anyone actually buy this?
Currently 103k up  197k down
Gay
Will Smith = Dog
This is exactly what I feared it would be. Breaks my heart to see and hear that you still did't get the point, Will. I sincerely hope that you will get it, sooner than later.
It took him 4 months to come up with that! Too little way too late...not to mention doesn't seem heartfelt whatsoever!!!
worst apology vid💀
Willy wanna cway a widdle more?
Bwak rage.
This is all i needed. I’m back in love with Will. We ALL make mistakes, he just happens to be on a bigger stage than most of us. Keep growing my friend & keep loving.
This may be the most disliked video of all time... I guess we'll never know
This really did ruin your career.
Looked up to you man. For over  25 years.     Would rush home and catch fresh prince. At a time when we didn’t even have “TeVo”Would act like you in school.   Would use your lines to be funny.   We all have our bad days and bad moments.  We all lose our sht at times.  But our response in anger and in our difficulties is what truly defines our character.   You have everything a man can ask for.  Sad to see your inspirational speeches don’t match the turmoil you feel within.    Find peace brother. Don’t let your woman destroy the image you’ve worked so hard to build.
Is he wearing a cap that says “W” for his name?
I feel like if Hitler made an apology video, it'd be more real and sincere than this clearly rehearsed garbage. Will, just give up
Too soon.
why won't he stop embarrassing himself? just stop.
Scripted, half hearted apology.  No thanks Hollywood
Fake apology. What was the budget for this staging?
Ahaaaa thats hahhhht
Will's Lawyer wrote this speech and he performed the Apology well.. Marketing team did a great job and he will be forgiven unfortunately.
Ya, it’s rewind time. If I could control rewind, I would want. Fortnite, and marques brownlee
Less an apology, more a self-promoting PR stunt.
Anyone know what Will's pronouns are?
Those light fixtures and furniture be looking brand new 👌
i pooioin
Man even started with the sigh
What on earth was this supposed to be? I can't think of anything more insincere & cringe than than high end production & what seems to be a film crew & staff for a 5 minute apology that that wasn't really an apology & just full of self justifying excuses. He's even wearing a Will Smith branded cap! This ladies & gentleman is an emasculated man who is extremely out of touch with both reality, real everyday people & himself. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a new movie in the works & this just studio forced pr in an attempt to repair the WS brand.
imagine if he was like, "now, before we get into this apology, this video is sponsored by raid shadow legends"...
To me he sounds sincere and I sympathize with what he's going through.  I don't think people should boil his entire career and accomplishments down to 5 minutes where he made such a horrible decision.  He was 100% wrong in every aspect of his behavior that night.  His actions in that moment revealed a colossally huge lack of good judgment, and possibly a character flaw that may have been simmering beneath the surface for a long time.  But I don't think it would be fair to judge anyone based on their worst moment and ignore everything good  they've done prior.   I'm glad he's seeing a behaviorist because he definitely needs to understand where that Impulse came from. That's the best way to make sure this doesn't happen again.    I like Will Smith.  I like his movies, his TV series, his music and his family.  I hope he gets past this so we can see him doing what he does best, entertaining fans and sharing his gift all over the world.    I also like Chris and I hope he's dealing with this in a healthy way.  I don't think an apology on video or one shared privately would make up for what Will did to him, but I hope these two majorly talented black men can someday become friends.
Fire control.  Mal apology.  Scripted.  Produced.
If I waited 4 months to apologize to my parents for something I did wrong I would of been beaten lmao
clown
Fix your life Will.   Let go of toxic people.  Let go of toxic romantic relationship(s).    Let go the women in your life that disrespect you.       We want Will Smith back.     Be the AWESOME dude we all know you are.
Sometimes having the world in your hand might be an incredible burden, most of us will never know.
I feel sorry for Will Smith. Yeah sure what you did was pretty fucked up 🤦‍♀️ but it’s hardly the worst thing someone has done before… everyone just needs to relax
Should have named this video "The pursuit of authenticity" You were man enough to commit battery in front of millions of people. Be man enough to stick by your actions instead of damage control fake apology.  Just ewwww
Will: "I apologize to you" Wills head: (So ima do this and hopefully I will get signed back up for movies so I can keep makeing money. I'm a greedy mf)  Everyone: mate. That apology was about as bad as the toilet be lookin after taco bell!
this was not it
Glad you apologizes to Chris mother.  =}
I'm getting string Homelander vibes. Like Vought is behind the scenes trying to clean it all up. Lol 😆
Will looks like he needs some Andrew tate top G therapy😂🙌
This is kinda like the Logan Paul apology
What's really sad is he seemed like a genuine dude - like, I grew up watching him. I would respect him more, if he just said "what Chris said was inappropriate and I snapped. I got angry and in that moment, I was angry. I can't change it but it was wrong". Leave it at that- this whole PR thing is soooo much BS.
Dear Will I’m your biggest secret fan.  I was very upset with you.  I don’t care what anyone says I can only speak for me.  I forgive you.  God forgiveness you.  There will be tough days a head my friend you in time all will be well.  Much love God bless!!!
Oh how the great have fallen. From Hancock and I am Legend to Generic YouTuber apology video. Bruh
jesus christ,  a little too late dude? everybody has moved on already. stop digging this hole.
This is in the top 5 worst "apologies" I've ever heard...
Damn, Will! I was rooting for you!  This apology is weird af. Quit with the Tom Cruise school of public relations.
What a great actor! Only took a few months of prepping!
100k likes vs 200k dislikes XD L
I'm here for your apology
This is a better apology than Travis Scott
I hope the upcoming films will still be released because despite your actions you are still a very good actor and are what at what you do.
I just wonder why it will take will smith 100 days to think over and vedio this instead of pay a visit to Chris’s family or “his man” in person?
Hes a narcissist. Never not performing. For likes, views, acceptance. And thats why he snapped.
Stop playing like you're the victim, you were the aggressor, period.
Yikes
Truly an apology of all time
Y’all be judging too much! He did what most of us here would’ve done. Protect his family, he is a very good man who made a mistake in your eyes and you are making him do something he dont wanna. Apologize. Stfu you are NOT GOD, to be judging a person like that
Not a fan however I always thought that Will is an alright actor, but not so much for quite some  time now. As for what kind a person he is, I have no clue, I don't know the man personally. Only he knows who he is, when he is being sincere about it. That being said, people judge you (and everyone else) for what you do and did, say and said among other things. It's inevitable.
Has it really been 4 months already...? Congrats on the new movie deal btw.
For him to say it took 3 months,i spent less then a day to understand what I fucked up when a smacked someone as a child
i miss the dislike views
Will what happened to you man? Use to be cool.
This truly is one of the apology videos ever.
Everyone needs forgiveness at some point in their life and sometimes God will step in and give you a chance to Repent and ask for forgiveness, which one of you can say your perfect and I can prove your not. Give the guy a chance to put actions to his word . If you have issues in your life that bring you down in bad ways then remove yourself from that situation, you may be alone and not sure what to do, but there is a hope and a God who will look out for you.
Well that video is on the internet forever now...
Why did Will think the fancy over-produced camera work would make this video better? Like it just feels so much faker.
Dude needs to get rid of the toxic influence in his life.
This is like the defender throwing up his hands to the referee saying I have stopped fouling now
Well the one thing he got right was he needed to apologize but this late? It seems like it's more attention seeking for himself than a true apology to Chris
Also, you should be ashamed....  go with your gut on this one... you know exactly what you are already.
Eres un caballero, honorable y la demostración más grande de lo que es ser humilde. Mis profundos respetos y admiración. Un abrazo de corazón ❤️
Hahahahahaha
Good stuff. Now make an apology video for this apology video.
🐱
🤡
The goose is still going to be laying golden eggs but it was kicked thoroughly on the neck.
Bro, people love you. It's your "family" they can't stand.
Brah, I can't watch anything with you in it for a while man.
Film not selling? U forget the struggle,ur roots
He needed to train a couple more months to master the pet technique, 6/10 apology
“In this rewind I want…. Forgiveness…. And to keep my wife’s name out your MOUTH”
The message should have started “my career is nearly over and I’m at my wits ends”. BTW this apology video cost Will $1M in legal fees, public relations consultants and writers scripting this video. He’s using very complicated language “unpack my feelings”. I’m putting in the work….
“It’s rewind time”
This is definitely one of YouTube apologies that have been uploaded
🔥🔥🔥
yaaa 😞 it’s… 😞 rewind time 😭
Dear Will,   I know you feel regretful and sad of that  embarrassing moment but don't torment yourself, you are a human being, just like us and you're not free of making mistakes, you didn't disappoint me for that and I'm pretty sure a big bunch of the people didn't feel that way, it was just an unfortunate moment of acting before thinking, it's totally normal as humans chained by imperfection, but in your video I notice some signs of sorrow and depression, I don't know what's going on in your personal life but please take care of yourself, it's good that you asked for help and you're making good progress by admitting your mistake, we love you and don't think like you have reached the lowest because you didn't, this was just bad moment in your life, when things like this happen, I remember a verse of the Bible in Psalm 55:22:  "Throw your burden on Jehovah, And he will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to fall"  Pray to God with confidence and ask him to make you feel better and improve as a person, he will definitely help you, if Chris doesn't apologize to you, give it time, I don't know if you will read this message but I hope it reaches to you in some way, don't forget that we love you so much.  Atte. Kevin from Ecuador
You could have don’t better and we all too Jajajajaaj we all have traumas. Judge as you shall be judged.
DISLIKE 👎
You know it was WRONG.  Friends?  idk...
This video is to apologize to those who let down for his actions.
I guess Chris will forgive you in 4 months.
Totally 💯% unacceptable excuses for horrible behavior. Too many words saying too much about how this affected YOU. And one little unemotional unfeeling blip to Chris. I was your biggest fan Will. This  wasn’t a “mistake”. This was a great moment of revelation for those of us who thought we knew you. It can’t be undone. We’ll never be friends again.
L
Its really not that deep lol
Reminder that even if we can’t see dislikes he can. Go nuts people
This is truly one of the apologies.
Amber,Ezra n now Will...Snyderverse sure knows how to pick their role models...
Will. Move your body (self) away from the people that don’t make you better.
Will is doing the old Hollywood grovel routine to gain back the favor of the public. It won't work man.
I wish I could see the dislike count
Alright, he apologized, now let's get Bad Boys 4 in 🙏
"Yah, it's rewind time!"
How was this an apology to Chris? Badly done Will.
Wahh
His life indeed did get flipped upside down
_I like how it starts off with an annoyed sigh._ He then says “Chris, I’m here when *you’re* ready to talk. Putting the onus of reconciliation on Chris.  What a colossal scumbag.
Total bs and fake as it gets. Lies and more lies.
You made a mistake, say sorry to Chris and move on, do better, don't make excuses and don't try to be a victim.
"it's been a minute"  more like 175,200 minutes (4 months)
PS go right ahead and feel ashamed of yourself.
wdf such an incredible and moving line
You’re aware this reads as insincere and incredibly cringe, right?
Why are there so many likes?
Its all act!     That didn't come "REAL" at all !!  All scripted Keep digging your own hole Will
How many takes did this take?
why are you reading from behind the camera while sounding like a robot like atleast rehearse your lines bro
Will I  love ya but you fucked up 😞
Used to like this man. Have absolutely zero interest in any of his bullshit or anything he will produce in the future.
FAF fake as…figure it out
Don’t care tbh😂
Bro finna cry😂
He actually said sorry that's more than most YouTubers do in apology videos good enough for me👍
Imagine being this self centered lol
Will is so lucky to have Jada's boyfriends as the camera crew.
Well at least it was better than Logan Paul's! 😂
Sounds like his husband wrote it
1- Will necesita una transfusión de dignidad y alejarse de la pelota tóxica esa.  2-  Los comentarios de los gringos solo me hace confirmar aún más que son una rama de la humanidad subdesarrollada. Dejen  la coca(-cola), les está quemando las últimas neuronas que les queda.  3- La mejor manera de dormir es escuchar el "humor" gringo, es una puta mierda, como pueden llamar comediante a alguien como al que se ganó la pila?
"The world is sick, love is the cure" 🙄 so fake
193k thumbs down👏😆
Glad he recorded himself sitting down. Very necessary for this apology video.
Nice light right behind his head. Almost makes him look like an angel with a halo. Everything about this video was well thought out except for respecting Chris by waiting for Chris to contact Will when he's ready
Before you even see him you can hear PR staff, lawyers, whoever it may be giving him his final prep. Not sure why they would include that in the final cut. Completely bizarre decision.....Then the great and powerful Will Smith enters to greet us with a deep sigh. One clearly intended to portray a sense of deep remorse and inner turmoil 🙄....  The set looks like he's about to sell us something(he is), and based on his attire, he clearly just finished or is in the middle of a round of golf. Yet another completely bizarre decision right outta the gate. All of that before he even mutters a single word to the camera, and several months after what he's "apologizing" for......So I give the man and his team credit for miraculously managing to eliminate any and all sense of sincerity(artificial or otherwise) before the "apology" even begins.....Someone needs to tell them next time that this isn't the first ever YouTube apology, and that there's actually been several others. As Cr1tikal pointed out in his video, the only thing missing here is his dog 😅
After months of practice THE APOLOGY
I LIKE I AM LEGEND MOVIE OF YOURS, DO MORE ZOMBIE MOVIES
So he’s sorry for his family but only apologetic for Chris? Ok sure
Excellent production values in this ‘apology’ - your a good actor Will, terrible person but a good actor.
I have not seen acting this bad since the movie Hancock.
Your new name is Will Cvck
The marketing of the water bottle in this video!
An apology in a Q&A format? “I’m here when you’re ready to talk”🤣 Unreal .
Will’s apology was about as genuine as Jada’s wedding vows. credit pudpuduk
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
this kind of thing is getting old.
(slow clap...)
He didn't even memorize the script, like c'mon man  We all knew he was a bad actor but like 😂
I like how in the description there's a link to buy his book about opening up. *Definitely* not just doing this for money.
Ratio .....
He’s using product placement to promote his son’s new business, it’s not a genuine or real apology, he should have apologize to him in private, not in public to promote a product, shame on will.
Suge Smith fails at real apologies; fake, scripted apology with his acting skill trying to save it. Hes trying to apologize for everyone except himself to him directly vs playing victim and hiding behind the people that justified it and letting it run on for 3 months, coward xD and having professional camera work/and bits cut out isnt a real apology
Ok now apologize for after earth...
Hey Will. A lot of people I know including myself have let our emotions get the best of us and made us act out of character. Hope you're healing and find a way to forgive yourself.
Wow the ego insane I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself. You should be ashamed of yourself as part of acknowledging that you did something really crappy dude
In case if anyone is wondering how the video is doing, it is standing at 192.4K dislikes and is almost at 200,00 dislikes. The Logan Paul apology isn't effective
Well ding dang I love how every single comment is an absolute roast 🤣
Pathetic 😄
His hat has a W to offset all his Ls
Will’s apology is about as genuine as Jada’s wedding vows.
Amazing that comments are enabled on this video. 😂😂😂
At least the fakery was authentic!
all the love for u will 🥰
I feel if u have the willingness to apologize it shows ur true character as a man. Respect
mucho amor desde canada
much love fom bazil
He has a limited conception of reality.
Justify, justify, justify. You acted on impulse and took away from everyone's moment. Why can't you be humble and say I am ashamed of myself for my actions, and there is no excuse for my actions. Why is this about your feelings and not everyone else's? There's a difference between shame and having empathy.
Lmao nobody cares
Hey will, what’s up
To apologize you actually have to say I'm Sorry I made a Mistake but I didn't not once hear a I'm Sorry not once in this whole video
Another shout-out from the times of =3: Fake and ... !
Chris just needs to be “like keep my name out Ya motherfucking mouth!!”
WHY YO EYES SO FAR APART
get divorced, pls
When damage control doesn't work, just fall back on product placement. Classy
The worst apology in youtube
As fake as CNN and MSNBC news.
You were someone i used to look up... It was such pathetic and such unbelieveable situation you out yourself in... Indeed its the age where you see your heroes to become vilains
Wow. What a set!!, It's almost like the background is statically placed.  Hmmmm
Leave Will be, not everyone can be as perfect as everyone in these comments.
Sad and pathetic..
What an utter disappointment this man is.
Praying for you, Will.
Tool
Take my downvote and see u in 10 years
So brave to not actually apologize to Chris.
Nice one Slappy Hancuck! 🤣
He's scamming us. Boycott his black love movie and his $35 million dollar payday.
So fake, he is an elitist in his mind, thinks he can do anything. He disgusts me now. Get over yourself will!
I want to believe Will used to be a man, but current-day evidence is nonexistent.
It’s morbin time
Apologies should be short & to the point.  "I was wrong." "I wronged you."  Talking too much in an apology makes it seem self-serving.  He lost me when he started talking about how he was going to move forward after this.
I’m waiting on the same speech from Donald Trump to our country.
FOH!
Dude literally prepared a 4 month production for an apology... you're lost bro...🙏🏻
Unfortunately YouTube removed the dislike button
damn
lol is this 2019 calling out James Charles again!! Muahahaha Stephanie Hartin better Sue will smith into his grave soon!!!!
The Studio made him apologize because of the movie deal he just made that's why this apology video in front of a live and studio audience 😆 🤣 😂
People this is his apology for what he did! Only God knows if it’s legit man can’t be the judge!! Our comments and behavior make it difficult for someone to seek forgiveness! We should be encouraging him not torturing him! Will is not perfect and will never be perfect and neither are we! That’s what Christian’s should do! Be peace makers! I’m not saying what he did was right. But let’s pray and hope there is a resolution in the end. I’m sure Chris needs  time to heal too! I hope you pursue peace and personal growth Will! Blessings to everyone here ❤️
Will. I hope you learn from this, better yourself and move forward.  Hope you and Chris can be friends again….some day.
🤣
SHAME !
Logan Paul's apology was better than this 😂
damage has been done. no 1ups in real life for a grown @ss man
That's Tuff
"Trying to be remorseful without feeling like a piece of 💩" is the difference between an #apology and a #sorry...  An apology is just an explanation,  acknowledgement and onus of what happened... The etymology of the word apology is Greek apologia meaning a "defence, story, justification, account". So just because someone apologises doesn't mean they feel/are sorry... Sorry is an old English word meaning to be "grieved, feel SORROW". 'Sorry' comes from 'sorrow' ; you can't be sorry without feeling sorrow (like 💩)... When someone is sorry they actually HAVE TO #FEEL bad (like a piece 💩) and remorseful. 🤷🏾‍♂️  *An apology is NOT a **#feeling**, sorry and remorse ARE.*  Trying NOT to feel bad "like 💩" whilst simultaneously trying to be remorseful is like trying to swim and not get (feel) wet... it's a Sisyphean contradicting paradox. #impossible   Mr William's speech comes off more as an a apology trying to be a sorry... Remorse and sorrow aren't emotions you TRY to have/be; you either are sorry and own the feeling of being a piece of 💩  OR you give people an apology (account, defense, story).
Wait... does this "apology" video have product placement? Lol.
hahah downvotes are more then the likes lol
FAKE AF!!
Two *sighs* 30 seconds in…. Classic YouTube apology vid
Gotta respect the comments are open tbh.
Tommy Wiseau can make a more believable delivery than this.
Lame.
Bye bye will smith
It was the perfect storm, that makes you wonder what is God trying to teach us, make us aware of and/or build in us. I’m a compassionate person and now I’m more compassionate I feel like I was connected with the world; we all felt something big. I believe that we all have developed something better. God thought the three of you could impact us that way.  Many are called and few are chosen.
No way it actually starts with a dejected sigh
What a great actor 👏👏👏
can someone time stamp the actual apology?  watched 5 times and still can't find it.
The part when he said “it’s slappin time” made me cry rn 💀
Cringe x 1000
Can't imagine a better "Oh man people didnt like that, better pretend im sorry" video
This doesnt feel sincere, will still believes he was justified in doing what he did and feels like chris should be the one apologozing
While you're in the mood, how about an apology for After Earth?
In the span of one year, Will Smith went from being the poster child of the successful black man.  to the poster child of the most Beta man in the world.
Hahahahaha thats hot!!
I expected you to act better
I think you may need to think for another few months, and then a few months after that and then a few months after that...so we can all be all fuzzy about you.
Who put this tampon on the internet?
189k dislikes and counting 😂
Worst role he has ever played.  Not believable at all.
Talk about a lame phony unheartfelt apology. Scripted AF.
Jamás creí que de verdad era real, jamás creí que fueras así, todos nos equivocamos, pero lamentablemente hay errores con los que jamás tu vida vuelve a ser la misma. Lo siento por vos will. Dios te siga bendiciendo siempre
we all know Will knows how to act the part. this is him acting.
Why-does-he-read-like-this?
Cmon dude, smh. Sigh. I’m not even gonna add to these comments and downvotes, nothing more to say.
Just stop. This is so staged.
Learned something today- You can be truly sorry for doing something bad but NOT be ashamed of yourself for doing it! Must be a Hollywood invention.
I've never thought Will Smith was a great actor, but now I'm not even going to waste free rentals on his films anymore.
60 / 40 to dislikes. Must be a YouTube apology video.
Divorce will save you bruh.
This is late. Insincere. Scripted. Etc. Damage control.
Nothing says "I'm sorry" like a professionally produced video 4 months too late. 😆  You need to get out of that toxic relationship, guy.
I love you Will! 😍...still
This apology is about as genuine as Jadas wedding vows
Insincere.
too late lost all respect for ya.
Someone call Pewds to rate this apology video
This was some of the worst acting I've seen from Will Smith
"I apologise" isn't the same as saying I'm really sorry I f'ed up. Fake scripted apology.
Okay, but... You promoted your son's water brand?! Have you no shame?
Authentic, raw, and moving. Thank you for apologizing to those who were affected by this event. You had the courage to be vulnerable in front of the whole world and we love you for it. Stay strong will. Have faith. We believe in you. <3
Will, you're controlled by a succubus
Sorry Not Sorry   🙄   Lame.
Maybe the most-produced and expensive apology vid ever.  OK, not Maybe.
189k dislikes so far on this video not looking good for ya will lil late for damage control
This is just embarrassing. I loved Independence Day and now I can't even watch it. This video has no ring of truth or sincerity. I will never watch your movies again. Because honestly, you just don't get it.
Thanks for giving us a great laughter!
Apology hmm 🤔🤔🤔 no have a boxing 🥊🥊🥊 match with Chris or better with Sam Hyde fighting in his corner as they say Talk is cheap buddy Talk is cheap
His you tube videos are better than his movies.
sorry will
HAHAHA.....THIS FAKE-A$$ APOLOGY VIDEO IS GETTING ABSOLUTELY RATIO'D!!!!!!    This apology is about as real as Jada's wedding vows.
Sick of Hollywood paid pretender psychopaths.
you done son you failed miserably go comb jadas skull
Let it go Will, set yourself free.
I liked the bit in which will Smith fights Godzilla and shouts " IT'S FEMALE BALDNESS TIME! ".
kid from the street becomes a wealthy elitist, go away bro.
impressive. still at digging the grave of his own career. 4 months of wait for THAT.
🍋✊ #CLM
I don’t forgive Will Smith right now. What he did was wrong. Maybe sometime in the future, I’ll forgive him.
Hollow. Over produced. inauthentic.
This was as sincere and real as jada’s wedding vows
Your movies were great back then but your apology is too late.
No, thank you for the funny video
Forgiveness is key my friend. We move through hurt every-day, through loss, through disappointment, through darkness, through contrast...Having that serious conversation with yourself understanding who you really are. Comes a softer version of how you see yourself in the world. Alot of healing starts there.   In Love and Light dear friend. To the Smith family.
I love how he’s made a 5 min video mostly talking about how hard it has been for HIM, HIS fans and HIS family and only a minute of him actually apologising to Chris and his mom. That clip is going to stay on the internet forever for Chris’s kids to see and Will should have addressed how traumatic this whole situation was for Chris as well. Such a bad apology to come up with in 3 months , I guess Will thinks that everything’s about him.
Insincere damage control.
This must be why youtube removed the dislike counter.
Hahahah cluckyyyyyyyy 😂
Little known fact, the W on his hat stands for Wanker, as in he’s a wanker for making an apology video long after the incident happened.
103K likes and 187K dislikes....GEEZUS😅
HAHAHAHAHAHA that "Sigh" at the start , hahahahahahahahahahahahaha so fake
Out of everything said, I appreciate WS saying that he knows he handled it wrong.
During quarantine Mr. Smith he released a video that was supposed to be body positivity showing you with a dad bod and I looked up to you as Ali when you took that role and you took on the muscle mass you look like a beast and I reflect it on myself I realize as a dad I’ve become as you did like a potato sack and my mental health really dwindled but out of that I’ve been bodybuilding for Christ because of you thank you for so much honesty Mr. Smith!
..........oh. neat.
Skittles
Seriously, Will, you are a total narcissist.  I have enjoyed some of your work, but as a person, you're just another out of touch rich A hole. Apology not accepted because I don't believe you are sincere. Just take your millions and go away.
What happened to this guy? He used to be a cool hot-shot back in the day. Now he’s a meme most people feel sorry for… 😕
Weak dog
Perfect Youtube Apology
What kinda monster leaves his shoe laces like that?
UUmmm...Why not just say (Without all the production of sighing and camera angles):   ''Listen ya'll, I'm gonna make this short. I really fuk&D up. I'm working through things. I've got issues and a dark side I'm working through. I'm in anger management, even taking a few pills (for example). AND I‘m not perfect. No words can take back my actions, but I just wanted to shine some light on where I'm at right now..'' DONE(Then, answers questions straight forward, sincerely, without laughter).  Instead, you get an apology that seems scripted in some way, or at least solely directed towards a fanbase that might be appalled, not at him as a person, but as the 'squeaky clean' public persona he has created throughout his life. This feels more like trying to save his image, not him.   The ''I promise we can be friends, or the ''I promise I am deeply committed to putting light and love int o the world..''... Though he might WANT to mean that, he has to know that trying to change or do serious inner work, never starts with an 'I promise.'  Promises are for fools, politicians, PR agencies, and people desperate for the approval of others. You don't promise, you ACT! And you let time weave its web.  I would say to Will, don't suppress the darkness! Let it out, open it up, go with it, just be honest about it with people. I don't think trying to resuscitate your image (preslap) will ever cut the mustard.  Noone is perfect and everyone has a dark side. Claim your failure! Shame only comes when you try to bury it.
There's no part of me that believes a single word of this bullshit. Really? This is the best you can do after FOUR MONTHS.
Just because he puts it on YouTube doesn’t mean he doesn’t mean it. Yes he is an amazing actor but that does NOT mean he used that talent on this video. He is such an amazing person. He DID NOT use a script. Yes he does stutter a lot but cuz he is being genuine. STOP ASSUMING!!
wish it was more sincere and unscripted but still, apology appreciated
It’s been a minute?! No it’s been months.
Great acting Will -love that you're reading a script as well 🙄
Hmm, Chris doesn't want to talk so I'll just make a video to get rid of my guilt. Nice.
Washed up 🗑
That was really one of the apology videos
everybody gangsta till you hear the director say “CUT”
Sorry y'all but I believe him and commend them yeah he reacted an appropriately but put yourself in his shoes let someone you dearly love being insulted sometimes we act without thinking
Cold
Great job Will!
Sigh into the mic off camera to let us know how much this burdens you bro 😭
It's been a minute? No bro it's been 4 months 💀
He isn’t really sorry, it’s just a publicity thing
Just like Logan Paul
when he said its apologizing time, those words just changed my life, completely.
Tbh his apology is staged and if anyone else in the free world did that they would be in jail. One rule for us another for the rich.
The attack on Dave Chappelle is your fault, every comedian attacked in the future, is your fault. Your apology? Too little, too late.
Yeah this is definetly one of the videos on YouTube
Finally a new interesting to watch video since:”so long nerds”.
I thought you’ve already apologized wha?!?!
Just stay off YouTube muh dude.
I always thought he was a good actor...but how did he do so bad at faking THIS?  I don't get it.
Yawn.. bored now... you said sorry, he don't accept it... who cares? move on!
You know it's a good apology when they portray themselves as the victim
I'm so thankful I don't rely on U folks 4 forgiveness or I will be in trouble. People really forget the tines they really needed forgiveness & prayed the person on the other end was opened to receive it. Will is free if he came with a pure heart. It's up to Chris at this point so Will be free & live your life. Do be in bondage.
It’s been more than a “minute” Will.
Great acting, Will 👏
Very articulate like he's standing infront of jury
A true testament of reaction before thinking.  We all saw it. Now when Chris and Will show forgiveness to each other after all of that, it will deliver a very powerful message of respect, love, and forgiveness for all to learn from.  ❤️ to you both.
It takes time to process and grow. People that are saying he should have done this months ago don't realize the unpacking process doesn't happen overnight.  We all make mistakes and applaud his complete accountability of his actions. I think we all know what a toxic relationship can do to you and he is a victim.  We love you Will and get better and become better than ever.
its a shame we cant see dislikes
it the bust apolage video ever. btw i for give you
"Yahahaaa, thas hot! Its rewing time" - Will Smithy 2018
Will, I love you dude, but I would rather see you holding a phone sitting in the park with some honest emotion flowing. Who I am I to judge, I just know there is more inside to say, let's hear it away from the studio.
This is almost as bad as the Travis Scott apology...almost.
*Show me the money!!!*
It's rewind time!!
Men don’t be so hats on you. We are humans. We make mistakes. Everything is fine.
Oh, it's you again. What are you still doing here, dude?
This man actually apologized to that witch. Lmao still a dog on a leash. Pitiful. He may be the fresh prince but shes clearly queen. And her king is whoever she deems fit for the occasion. But never him lmao. All respect gone.
Will...the only thing you need to get out of all these comments is: You. Still. Getting. It. Wrong!  Reach out to me.  Time to get it right!
It takes a lot for a narcissist to pretend to apologise! I give you a C- for trying.
Too bad you can't see the amount of dislikes anymore.....
I'm still confused about what happened
If you wanted to truly apologise, you wouldn't setup a whole video for this. You wouldn't even go public. Anyway what is done, is done. The right thing to do from now and then is to apologise him privatly.
Ok. lets start over.
Fresh Prince of Bellend
Looking for the ratio comment so I can like it
"we don't believe you, you need more people"
Common Will Smith L
Hey will, sir, I love you man, I grew up watching you growing up too.   About your actions? Indeed they were something I would’ve never expected from you. But hey, you’re a human being before you’re a star and a member of society, I’m glad to hear you’re feeling like that about your actions, lesson learned. Let’s hope Chris and his family and friends can forgive you. Keep working man, we love you and anyone could’ve done that, it’s not that easy to hold yourself after you feel somebody just disrespected a family member, I get it, I think we all do. Just keep making amends as much as necessary because after you’re only human, you’re a very famous and loved figure, your actions may influence your fans more than you know. Be at peace and keep up the hard work. I trust you’ll do way better.
Top GEEK
No one, absolutely no one:  *Passive-aggressive pro-roast(ers) have entered the comment section*
Kudos to you Will! A way to show bravery in light of the darkness. We are all human. Be strong
Así se piden disculpas. Sentidas. Le creo todo.
Is it me or Is this guy talking like a robot 🤖
I really dont get it.  I've seen comments where people say that he is making the apology video for moeny or somethin, and that he didnt need to, but then people are saying that the video is tool late
🍋 CLM ✊️
Has he had a stroke before this? Or just really hammered.....
5:05  and I try my hardest to think of you as a piece of such.
He is not a bad person. What he did will have huge impact on him and his family. Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you never did something that you regret doing. He worked hard to be where he is now. Probably more then any of us can imagine. Judgeing is easy... Try be better Mr Smith and hope to see more good movies with you.
My ONLY QUESTION to you, Will, (( ***TO *** Will)) is this:  WHY the hell are you doing this TO YOURSELF publically??? The people that you've needed to apologize to can all be reached out to via private ways.   This is supposition because I don't know you personally, however, Pubically throwing yourself out to the wolves doesn't make sense unless it's to feed the divide between pro/opposed fans...or...for self-punishment. Either aren't healthy.   EDIT: Dear Hater...leave it. It won't be worth your time.
He need to leave that woman alone bruh
Ohw boo-feckin-hoo 😂
i still love will smiff.
Damn best actor apology right there
Researcher Aaron Lazare studied apologies for years, and concluded that an effective apology has four parts:   1. It acknowledges the offense (who did the harm to whom, and exactly what the harm was),  2. offers an explanation for the offense (not an excuse, but an explanation),  3. expresses remorse or shame (some recognition of the depth of suffering caused is needed here), and  4. involves a repair of some kind (compensation, in a real or symbolic way, for the offender’s transgression)  it seems several of these elements are missing here. wdyt?
#GivebackyourOscar
Will please stop apologizing 😬😬😬🥺🥺 Chris whatever his name is has lost a fan. We love you Will Smith forever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌍💪🏼
Will forget all the haters. Keep working on mending your bridges. Love both you and Chris and praying for reconciliation. This event does not define you and there is years of evidence that you are a good person
The product placement of the brands he owns with the cap and the water is hilarious.
Um erro foi cometido. O importante é ter a hombridade de reconhecer de verdade,  de forma honesta  o erro e mudar as atitudes.  Não vejo falsidade no vídeo,  embora tenha demorado pra fazer, e isso não significa necessariamente que ele tenha ensaiado.  As vezes é muito difícil achar palavras que representem o tamanho da vergonha.  Siga em frente Will e faça seu melhor,  seja um pai melhor,  um marido melhor,  um ser humano melhor... afinal o que levamos dessa vida não é o papel ou personagem,  mas sim as coisas boas que fizemos!
People make mistakes. I didn't judge you before and I don't judge you now, not as long as I make mistakes myself.
Ratio
That is a REALLY nice room, Will 💖!! The wall panels give it the initial feeling of being concrete but the longer I looked around, the softer it all began to feel. Then I noticed they were panels. It's a really good touch. And your socks. I also thought your socks were nice as well.
Will...just move to your auntie and uncle in Bel Air my guy.
One of my old bosses used to say "It's just a matter of time before I let you down.  It's how we deal with it that matters."  Will, you are dealing with it as the man of integrity that you are.   We are all human and make mistakes.  You did the right thing here.  I for one forgive you and I hope Chris, his mom, brother and family find their way to do the same in their own time.  Same for the community and all involved.   The world needs forgiveness as it is a gateway to love.  The toughest one is often forgiving ourselves so I send light and love on this journey.  I'm behind you and your family Will.
he did a reddit AMA lol
LMFAOOOOOO
‘I want to apologise’ - yet not one actual apology given… We all make mistakes, but the consequence you should now endure is the weight that balances the privileges you enjoy.
If anything goes wrong with acting, you have a YouTube career now
My reaction: What a perfect lie.
I was so waiting for this! I am so glad to have heard from you, Will and i hope we will see more of your joyful self.
Straight 💩 bruh be man not a cuck
@wallo267 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 u see what I see ?? Logo looks familiar
Complete with 2 camera angles and cuts. How many tales were there
sincere or not, who knows for sure - perhaps only God - but that needed to be done, and is a necessary part of occupying a position of being a "public role model"; well done, and I believe you'll find forgiveness Will - also great take on keeping respect for yourself while being remorseful
People are saying he’s only apologised because of the hate but if that was true then why didn’t he make the apology sooner?? He took a while because he needed to think on what he’s done and what was done wrong don’t hate the man for what he did it’s not even that bad 🤦🏽‍♀️
Breaks our hearts to have our childhood's favourite prince show their true colours and destroy what we all loved so much.  R.I.P the fresh prince
Lets put it this way will. Maybe you are a 100% apologetic. But your lady had all to do with it.
Hello Will Smith, first at all, you doing great Speech, and explain why... also i am sure a lot people include myself, Forgiven you 100%  we always love you no matter what #WillSMiTH
you can tell his wife's boyfriends wrote this for him
This is just as good as the Travis Scott apology. If not better
Thanks Will. I was one of the people who felt really let down - you're right, it was really confusing. I guess with people in the public eye, I form an opinion of who they are based on what they say and how they act. So when they do something completely contradictory to that, it makes me wonder if they are who I believed they were. But I appreciate everything you have said here. And I'm a big believer that we are not our mistakes. I hope you're able to unpack this and move on to the next chapter of your life. It doesn't have to define you.
I love the production value of this. All these camera angles and even getting the posters and the books in view. I've seen better from streamers
The apology could have done without showcasing your Brand ($) Peace be with you Will.
it's been a month. 4 actually
This foo😂😂😂
this is the ultimate cringe video
Uh ..oh ..yeah yeah exactly how it looks it’s exactly how it is 🦈😂😭
YouTube removed downvotes to prepare for this moment
We put people on a pedestal and we are disappointed when they let us down by being human. And all of you celebrities, who believe the hype and think you are above it all...watch and learn. We are all humans and no one on this earth has yet mastered this business of being a human being. Let us all be humbled by this collective experience!
This reflects some deep work on yourself, Will. As you stated, "trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of yourself". Not everyone will understand that. Those of us who have made choices that we're not proud of and have a pattern of beating ourselves up BEYOND THE POINT WHERE IT'S HEALTHY can relate. I pray that you will continue the good work you've started on your journey to emotional & spiritual wholeness, freedom, and health. God bless you!
That's crazy
This is awful. Are you channeling Jadas manuscript here? Or is this an unrehearsed interview/apology?  The staged sigh of reflective understanding at the beginning is cringe worthy, flower.
We still love you will .. Let’s all move on … 🙄🤭🤭🤭.           In other news Monkeypox is now listed as a global pandemic 😤😤
How would Chris even find this? This title could've been promoting a new VEVO drop, ffs.   "Friends don't lie." - "Eleven", Stranger Things
Idk bro I still like u.. U made my childhood🗿
They still pay you to act?
He apologized and y'all still gonna hate
Bringing light, love, and joy into the world includes vulnerability in healing, and personal ownership of one's mistakes.  I'm grateful Will shared where he is in his journey. I see this share as an example of light, love, and a person on his path back to joy.
This world is a stage 🥱😴
fortnite
It's kind of a necessity to feel like a POS about something when you have been one. It doesn't take a deep dive into trauma to acknowledge you have a nasty temper when it flares and a tendency to feel superior to others. Chris isn't the first person you've mistreated.
With your sons water in the shot? 🤡
This apology is not great but tbh no matter how good the apology is people are still gonna be mad smh
Can't believe he left comments on.
I still think the whole thing was fake and set up between them.
Wow. This really sucks. With a professional twist.
Most insincere apology ever. You get "traumatized" from letting people down? Well you have some serious self growth to do then cuz you have let ALL of us down. And what you did was genuinely unforgivable. We don't like you anymore Will. The best move you could make right now is to disappear for awhile. Take some time. A lot of time.
I sure wish we could see the true ratio of likes to dislikes on this one.
Lets be real you did what you did because you knew Chris wouldn't swing back your a bully
clown
Can't trust actors...
He feels entitled to everyone's forgiveness too?
We all make mistakes, especially when we get really triggered by painful situations. I appreciate you sharing your process, I imagine it's very challenging to do in such a public manner. Wishing you well with the healing process.
Product-Placement is everything.
Wow 😂😂😂😂
Will Officially a Youtuber now after this apology video
I'm so tired of it all being about being seen doing good rather than actually doing good.  Humility is good.  Turn the damn camera off for once in your life.
Hahahah cluckyyyyyyyy 😂
Almost 200K in dislikes to 100k in likes, thanks for removing the dislike count
Жаль, что много ненависти вылилось на тебя, дорогой Уилл!!! Лет 20 назад этот случай не вызвал бы столько негатива... Посмеялись бы и всё, мне кажется. И ненавидели бы Криса за его плохую шутку... А сейчас, в наши дни, гораздо больше запретов и лицемерия в вашей стране, и многие думают по шаблону и/или просто боятся говорить то, что думают и чувствуют на самом деле...  Говоря подлую шутку о твоей жене, Крис ведь не подумал о твоей семье, о матери твоей жены... А ты так благородно поступил, извинившись перед матерью Криса тоже...  Я чувствую, что ты очень хороший человек!!! Даже тот факт, что все твои герои в фильмах с твоим участием это яркие, глубокие персонажи, которые заставляют задуматься. Ты один из самых любимых актёров!!! Береги себя и своих родных и близких!!! Будь счастлив всегда!!! Новых успешных проектов дорогой наш Уилл Смит!!! Мы тебя очень любим и всегда поддержим!!! 😍🙏🤗❤
youtuber apology with big words
But you partied all night, with no apologies.
Disgraceful. Thought you were a good enough actor to make that apology more convincing. Wrong.
Lot of “YouTube Apology” comments here.  If you want to quickly disseminate something to reach max exposure, this is the way to do it. Realistically though, there was a part of him that thought that his response was the right one, specifically at the time.  Also, it’s ok to be ashamed of yourself.  It’s one of the things that keeps you from making the same mistake in the future.
You could have thought about it before, you fool. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Shame…
You will be fine bro.. Allow God to change and heal you# He forgives, may you be found in Him in this season#
Chris > Will
Yung Dub D the rap sensation checking in
I want to apologize to the hot dog vender at the baseball stadium who felt disrespected for what I did to Chris. It's all fuzzy to me
CUUUUUUCK
Usually Youtubers try to make it big and upgrade into the Hollywood space. Will Smith is successfully doing the opposite.
BYE YALL ARE RUTHLESS.
Don’t think you need to say sorry 😢
No te compro nada. Ya no
Bro should’ve said 4 months ago, “Yo, Chris. My bad bro. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t even done that.” This kinda feels like a lame duck apology that you’re forced to do when you believe you ain’t done nothing wrong.
“AHAHAAAA!!!” Will smith voice
This took you 4 months!!!??
Yaaaauuuurrgghh, it's rewind time
Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes it takes time to process how to respond to your behavior to grow.
He took his whole career and traded it for meme fame lol
L
Hi
Every dated youtuber apology ever. Betcha this video will get privated or deleted at some point and someone will keep reuploading it online so that will becomes kiwifarms's brand new lolcow victim ,  like the fine bros apology video for them screwing over youtubers using the REACT tagline.
It's only been a minute? Retry this with a bit of true empathy and regret when 30 minutes has gone by.
A Tier apology
“Truly an apology you’d expect from such a terrific actor”  What a Marvelous Performance
See, this is why Youtube hid the dislikes counter.
Seems honest, I will continue to enjoy Will's work, look we have all been angry but when your in entertainment everything is out there.  plenty of benefits to being successful like this but this is a real con.
Cool beans
"She had nothing to do with this"  She's literally the reason for this, on multiple fronts.
cringe
idk. Dude looked like he was laughing before Jaida shot him a look.
It’s the Fresh Prince
No tenía que pedir disculpas
Oh that's hot. It fake apologising time!!!
Idk if I should be mad or not I'm not on anyone's side I'm just sad to see my childhood favorite actor losing his career :////
fake
You deserve to be treated how Jaida treats you.
Apologize because your career is tanking.  LOLLLLLLLLL  What a shame. - Said no one ever.
Love that America centric poster behind him. The rest of the western world isn't sick... it's just America.
You was alright with it until you looked at Jada's face. Than you instantly turned. Does she have that much control. Chris does that extremely well and I thought it was funny. What you did was not!!  You don't deserve a second chance. Grow up and get your home problems taken care of and leave people alone .  Unforgivable
Its’bée 4months and now you remeber to apoligize?
Wtf is clm
Will I forgive you!
📍🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🤦🤦‍♂🤦‍♀MY REACTION TO WILL SMITH'S APOLOGY📌📍
Why can't these mfs just say look i fucked uo and i'm am truly sorry and be done with it. Stop looking for excuses
I need a dislike count on this video right now
Will. I hope the world we live in allows you to overcome you actions that night. Sadly, society spends more time magnifying every mistake, word, wrong, or mistep a person takes in their life, without allowing for the fact that we are beings that make mistakes, but that can also change and improve. I for one believe you are a man of heart and integrity who is trying his best to be the best version of himself he can. To Will Smith the man (not the actor, singer, comedian, but the father, son, husband, brother), I'll keep you and your family in my prayers.
The production value makes it feel so incredibly insincere
It's Morbin time
You are human and we are not or  should we be judging you. A lot of us react with our emotions first and not with our heads.Will I believe you are deeply sorry . There's a bright side just hold on. You can't spend the rest of your life apologizing there's always going to be  some people that only see and hear one thing .Don't get it misunderstood he was wrong on every level.  Forgiveness is real people I don't know Will Smith I know the characters he plays on TV and that's what we love. Its between him and Chris  not them and us.Chris I hope you are doing well Thanks to you and Will sharing your gifts with us we get  time in our lives to forget about our problems work days etc. It's what happens after all this is said and done is what I hope to see  happen and everyone on both sides of this are doing well.
You're not the first or last that will do something like this out of character. We have no place to judge you because everyone here has done something at some level wrong. All you can do is grow and become a better man, friend, Father, Son and Husband to those that love you and look up to you. Peace and blessings brother.
Nope
Took you 4 months lmfao.  Also why 3 cameras, crew, studio and more? Something is odd
The time for an apology was when you smacked Chris on stage in front of the world, not wait four months to do some lame YouTube apology. I truly hope the world never forgets this moment, it showed us that celebrities are just as imperfect as the rest of us and are NOT worth the worship they get.
Will, I'm glad you did the right and honorable thing to apologize publicly to Chris.  Both guys represent my generation, and at the end of the day, we want two of the most popular role models in the field of entertainment to come together and move on from this isolated incident.  Please do not hold on to bitterness or drag this out.  There is no clear winner here.  You guys are both from the east coast, mid-Atlantic area of the country, and we (Wilmington, DE) know how to forgive and move on with love and respect!
Bruh......
You are human and and the world will continue going with you and we need you continue making excellent movies love you
I forgive you Will. You are forgiven
Nice product placement. Really makes the apology come across as sincere and make Will seem like a very genuine person.
This is as terrible as it looks.
Imma smack the dislike button. The only reason some people may believe you is because you're an actor.
Thats great but guess what?  Jada’s still bald and irrelevant. This is all a stunt for Jada’s career and it still doesn’t exist.  She has no talent so she resorts to trying to be a mix of Oprah and Jerry Springer. It’s not going to work guys. Stop being delusional and just accept it. No one talks about her unless it has to do with drama and disrespect. Its gross and desperate. Just stop.
Will Smith rocking that Wario merch
Sounds like a parole hearing...
O ser humano fala mais alto, chegar a pedir desculpa do lado vítima da história,  parabéns Will por ser Um Maluco no Pedaço desse mundo.
Imagine if he said " I want to take time to apologize to absolutely nobody!""
So cringe. Let's just milk this as much as possible while the elite pedophile ring still isn't being pursued.
U should say im sorry chris
At the end of the the day, Chris shouldn't have let his lip react, because he certainly did not want to see your hand where your hip be at
Why you apologied you are suppose to say SORRY
I presume he watched Kevin Samuels videos on all of this...
Poorly scripted. Sounded like a robot the whole time
Can't believe he actually said "it's apologin' time!", such an incredible and moving line
The sign on his wall must have been made with pure irony.
haha its rewind time..
Will got the fresh AFs on, so you know hea serious
No taking back or apology, it is what it is, you took L and that it.
And to boot, a link to shop the "Will Smith" store....lmao....gtfoh.... Total Scripted BS....
Nope, everyone knows it was your wife's fault and yours, very lame apology
To be honest, I had forgotten about the whole incident. It takes a big man to apologize and I commend him for that. At the end of the day guys, this is between him and Chris and nobody amongst us has a right to judge
Why a lot of hate?
Interesting how they used a body mic yet have another mic in front of him not being used. That shirt is 100% a pro golfer shirt.
2:51 why is this man so light hearted, I thought this was an apology
I've seen the downfall of stars happen many times because they do something, then continually try to fix it or feel guilty about it instead of just forgetting and moving on.  Toby Turner is a good example, he was accused of drugging and raping a girl and that's where his career stopped when he could've just ignored the allegations and continued everything would be fine.
None of this would happen if he had the Neutralizer Flash from MIB
this is the dislike button
we do not care.
This is good satire material for The Boys season 4.
Weak af will taking the L
we love you ❤️❤️
That breath at the start though 😤😶‍🌫️
Magicker is even more disappointed after this “apology”
Just Stop…Get some help.
Wow this was so sincere I actually shed tears. Oh no wait that's just the stinging burn of the BS in my eyes...
This apology video is almost as bad as travis scotts
It's for moments like these you gotta have return yt dislikes extension. the ratio is beautiful.
Way too late!
this is one of the apologies of all time
Will Smith will need a few more months of personal work after he reads these comments.
He tried to make it look like he was getting the questions on a live stream and like he never saw them before.
Dude just stop. Just retire for your own good. People will hate you more for doing this kind of stuff. It's a kind a sad and lame apology.
It’s all good will, we forgive you gang 🙏🏾
will, you are a man. and you know how men apologize sincerely. come on! came to kris's house to have dinner and sincerely apologized there was no camera. just apologize between brothers
Lmao okay Logan Paul
You know what? Hes apologized and he has answered some rather uncomfortable questions....most telling he didn't turn off comments section.
Whatever
Surprised he isn’t wearing a sweater and his hair isn’t in a bun
WH....Y   ARRRRRRE Y...OU S   O   CHO....PY.... ITS PATHETIC, APOLIGES COME FROM THE HEART, THEY HAVE TO BE ON THE SPOT. You don't have to answer questions to know how you feel, or do you have to share this with the rest of the world. I pray for the best, but come on Will. I expect better from you.
This is like the day Trump mandated police to clear out some protesters who weren't harming absolutely anybody so that he could cross the street and do his ridiculous bible photo op in front of a church
F U!!!!!
I Am Legend 2
Stop lire 😂
PR stunt
Hollywood don't want u anymore so now you apologizing. lol
No way will smith apology is so genuine in fact he didn’t need to go talk to Chris face to face he went straight to the internet to talk about and had questions ready and answers ready only will could handle a situation like this so well
This man, like most in his position, needs to stop broadcasting his life. No wonder he acts insanely.  Isn't he tired of playing a role? Or does he really believe he is the man he sees on screens?  Take your $300m dollars, disappear to the woods, and remember the meaning of life. X
It was terrible what you did Will, but I do believe in forgiveness and this is good first step. I hope you’re also getting therapy to deal with root causes and heal 🙏
A looser apology! U lost Will! Cha Cha.. U lost our respect...........
Wow 3.1 mil views,  only 100k thumbs up. Seems like it must have a pretty bad ratio with WAY more thumbs down.    Lol this is so sad and pathetic,  it's not a real apology.
if it isn't slappy mcslap himself, that do be hot
The Jussie is strong with this one
Na boa, as vezes acho que esses atores são na verdade no estilo "The Boys" de ser, fingem ser bonzinhos na maioria das vezes, mas na verdade não estão nem aí pra o que qualquer pessoa esteja pensando...
MedMen stock Moving up now! Set your Family up for Life. Marijuana about to be legalized. Buy MedMen stock today! MMNFF....
The trolls are nothing, if not consistent.
For those who are wondering how many dislikes this got, there's an browser extension you can get that reveals them. Let's just say that you won't be surprised...
Lmaoooo hahahaahha
Nice product placement. Its a shame that you trying to make money even in apology video
Im done with this guy.  Thanks for the apology but the world moved on dude.  Next time think before you act.
...sorry...but we all saw the real Smith...nothing you can say will change that...
What a narcissist. He’s only still thinking of himself 100%
it rlly aint that big of a deal brah
This is one of the apologies of all time
Sat down at the start like he was sitting down in front of prison mates lol.
That apology was very jussie smollett-esque
Sorry Will but this video came as something you were pushed to do, after so many months, we can tell you do not regret of what you did, tell your manager that make you do this video that this was a total failure.
Bullshit, I don't think he is sincere. I think his ego is too big and out of control.
will Will Smith smith? Yes.. Will Smith will smith.
Tone of voice says it all. So fake he doesn't know what real is.
First of all, why does he sound and look like he is being held hostage? And second....how hard is it to say "I am sorry" .....saying I apologize is a stupid. I never understood the meaning of I apologize...it seems like a way to be as distant as you can from actually saying sorry, but still coming across like you are ? ?? jesus
Brother, Apology accepted. You haven't done a lot of wrong that I am aware of and everyone deserves a second chance.   Maybe a good idea would be to get involved with an anger management group or group where men act out violently. That way you can give back to the community. Also give to Chris's favorite charity.
180k dislikes lol
love you brother from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩
To all the Commenters: stop the judgment, really take things for the face value.  I’m sure you, you know who “you” are, would have preferred to see him in a dark room, sobbing and uncontainable.   But guess what you still would have something to say.  This is not your life situation, maybe you should put out your apology vid when you mess up so we can see how it’s done.  Anyway, Will you are human, we all make mistakes, yours was unfortunately in front of millions, but the haters are going to hate.  You are not a piece of S…, you are a person with feelings and your feelings got triggered.  If fans, family and so called friends and colleagues don’t speak to you ever again then it was worth it because you deserve unconditional love, we all do!  I love you and you are enough!  Keep working on you and everyone and everything will take care of themselves.  Much love for you and your fam ❤️🫶🙌
dude idc about haters im still ur fan
They tried to do the halo effect with that light globe behind his head. He ended up looking like that tech from space balls.   I can't unsee it.
This might be the worst apology in the history of apologies. Impressive.
😂😂😂
There was a time when people knew how to forgive and forget But nowadays it's all make one mistake and your life is over.
I don't think Chris should accept his apology because that's something that's always going to be remembered when you see Chris or Will.  It's already good enough for Will that he didn't sue him
His dodging of actually accepting responsibility appalling.  2:45-ish"There is no part of me ..." He's not even really acknowledge that he made a cognizant decision to get up and move toward Chris. If no part of him thought or believed that, the event would not have occurred. A real apology would acknowledge and confront that which, in himself, made it OK.  4:25-ish. What about those who felt let down by him. He talks about HIS central trauma. About how hard this is on HIM WHAT?!! Talk about self-serving.  4:55 Being remorseful without being ashamed of myself. Good Lord. No, no, Will you can't feel a true apology and heal from it until you DO admit that, at that moment, you were a piece of SH**. Doesn't mean that you always were, doesn't mean that you are now. But at that moment, boyo, you were.   But, son, this came across as if you hired Mark Bowden from the Behavior Panel to help you "communicate clearly and effectively along with members of the G7" to manage your appearance. And it feels fake, even if it isn't.  The best apology would not involve a fancy set up. Hand held camera, not a production. Maybe in a back yard or a messy room or a noisy bar. Script reads simply. Address Chris. Acknowledge you were a piece of sh** when you did that. Now you are working on improving yourself. "At (whatever) years old, I really should have left all that behind long before now and what happened proves I haven't. Gonna work on it, man, gonna work on it. You said you'd contact me when you were ready to talk. Whenever, man, whenever. I just hope it's soon. And for your mom, Ma'am I'm so, so sorry. I was just way beyond out of line and I know nothing I say can EVER be enough. I'm just so sorry. And Tony, you were my man. I don't know. I just don't know. Can we work on moving past this? What can I do? Can't make it right, because it wasn't. But can we work on moving past? Let me know. And for my fans, I'm sorry I upset and disappointed you. It shouldn't have happened and I know that. But it did. I hope over time I can regain your trust and support.   THIS we would believe. But not the fancy, dancy you did. High production value = fake.
You guys in the comments: you have no humanity. Or even empathy.
🗑️
Let he without sin cast the first stone,  we've all done regrettable things in the moment blinded by anger
boxing match ? 🤔
This is so bad lol
i hope y’all don’t jump on the apology train over this
This is how I want a firing to happen. 3 cameras, good lighting crew, humor, 5-7 takes. An apology is something else.
மண்ணிக்கிருவன் மனுசன் மன்னிப்பு கேக்குரவன் பெரிய மனுசன் 👏
Actors are gonna act...
👏
It's hard to watch the DOWN FALL OF WILL and how a man with the World at his finger tips can wilt as a man because he let the WRONG WOMEN in his life.. Be careful of the people you bring into your life!!!
Te amamos Will, y tienes todo nuestro apoyo de ❤️❤️❤️❤️ y siempre te apoyaremos Siempre
You can overcome this if you really put yourself in Chris' shoes and show him the respect he deserves for handling the whole incident with so much dignity and poise.  Don't let your ego prevent you from being humble and being real.
'KEEP. F***ING. MY. WIFES. MOUTH.'
Np man nothing happened , keep going 👍🏾
Will, I know you will never see this comment, but I have to get it out there. I used to have nothing but Respect for you. I grew up watching you perform and grow to an absolutely amazing entertainer. After that BS you pulled, all respect was lost. I will do everything in my power to never support you or your family again. Go back to La La Land with your millions and leave us alone. You don’t even deserve the attention or time I’ve given to make this comment, nor from anyone else. Thanks for the let down.
Молодец, мужик.
He made a mistake. He's admitting that. What else do yall want? We scream for ppl to be accountable and when they try their best to do that it's not good enough. Yall are exhausting.
The apology video that wasn't an apology video .. this is more like the my-agents-told-me-I-need-to-get-my-career-back-on-track-video 🙄
Whoever is reading this, im just trying to spread some positive energy, so I wish you a beautiful day, and stay healthy!
Chris doesn't need it his father has two jobs ha eu amo o Brasil
LOL
Will's apology being made publicly may not be ideal, but he did say that he reached out to Chris and that Chris is not ready -- be that for a private or a public interaction right now.  Who could blame him.  But constantly kicking a man when he's down, and BOTH men are down right now, is uncalled for.  People have not empathy.  I was also shocked, but who has not done something that they've regretted and sincerely apologized for?  Let him cast the first stone!  As for the everyone else, stop throwing stones!  We will all reap what we have sown.  I have much love and respect for BOTH of these Kings.
Thanks so much to apologize means a lot I'm sure Chris and family will accept it
Your lucky your not doing this video from a prison cell
Hey Will, I hope you'll find the time to read this. After watching your apology, I just hope that you'll take to heart, as you said, you're a human being. As such you'll make mistakes. Don't let this eat you up, we all make mistakes man. You have apologized and you've made amends. That right there shows character and remorse. Now march on and continue to be the great, flawed and loving man you are.   Thanks for all the laughs, tears and thoughtful introspection you've provided to my family, friends and myself. You are a light in the universe, never forget that. God bless.
My man we love you
You are the best Will Smith, other people make worst things and never give apologies! You always be a dear man for us!
I ve seen better acting from him than this...
This is why we need the dislike count.
The Internet has probably become the worse tool/weapon created by humans.
Good job will it only took you 4 months 👏🏽😊
Loved the video, the acting was 10/10.
I still love you will
Not good enough for me just yet.
So thats it huh? We’re some kinda apology squad?
Another Me, Me, Me song.
I love seeing us brothers forgiving each other right on Will it's appreciated.
Pitiful baby you are will smith
dude apologized to a camera
I felt like he is apologizing to me !
currently at 179,ooo dislikes
I've read thru 50 comments, your not fooling anyone Smollet.
no thanks
Apology is the expression of regret or remorse for an offense or injury. Forgiveness is the pardon for something that has been done. This is the key difference between apology and forgiveness. Making apologies and granting forgiveness are vital aspects in any type of relationship, even the one you had with Chris. It is a thing that goes both ways. Apologize - this shows that you understand what you've done, and then ask for forgiveness from the person. One of the things here is also trying to forgive yourself, learn from it and rise above it. Actions speak louder than any words. Be yourself, do what you believe is right and do it sincerily. This is how you should show the world that you're "putting light and love and joy into the world."  Also, I know that you don't want to admit it and I see you feel deep shame. You closed your eyes for long periods of time when saying them, which shows that you have pride in you, still. Pride is what lead you to this whole situation. Pride is also hiding your emotions and what you really think. In order to fix this - you need to talk. You need to share and not only with your closest friends or family, but with your fans and supporters.   A quote from Game of Thrones:  “A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward." - and your reward for your bad act here is to learn what has happened and be a better person tomorrow. Focus inwards to amend so tomorrow you can give to the world that light and love and joy you wish to give. Only then, I'll believe your words and acts are true.
Your life is a mess will. A terrible disaster. You need a spiritual guide. Learn about God, learn about the temporary world, learn about yourself and learn about the life after death.
Too little, too late. I used to admire you until you revealed your true nature to the world. Sad
Absolutely beautiful comments Will.
This is so phony. If he was sorry he wouldn't be discussing it in public and further let out his narcissism in this video when he was told Chris wasn't ready to discuss it. Rude. Chris deserves better than this.
Really does just seem like the typical bullshit YouTuber apology. Gotta wait the time then come out and “apologize”
179K ratio
why did you not get dragged to jail like a normal person
Damn this is some high quality apology video unlike Travis Scott's
Você reestabeleceu todo amor e carinho que sentia por você.  Volte logo! Quando você brilha, milhões brilham junto com você.  Quando você falha, nos faz pensar o quanto somos frágeis e passíveis de cometer grandes erros quando agimos de forma irracional.  Volte rápido! Precisamos de você!  You reestablished all the love and affection I felt for you. Come back soon! When you shine, millions shine along with you. When you fail, it makes us think how fragile we are and how liable to make big mistakes when we act irrationally. Come back fast! We need you!
I'm sorry all these people are so dispassionate and broken that they can't let a man talk about his feelings. A true wonder of inclusivity right there... -_-  Will, I can only imagine what you are going through. You've been a hero of mine since I was a child and I for one can never be anything but proud of you and proud to know you.   We've all made mistakes, and are all human.  Keep living, growing, and spending love. I'm proud of you brother.
No. Just no.
you all forget that Will Smith is a human being 😔
Cool but honestly idc I haven’t really care over the last 4 months also-
Good trailer for.. which movie again?
I'm sorry, but I just can't trust this guy anymore.
1) Grace and Mercy is available for us all. That does NOT exclude YOU, Will. 2) If you believe in God, He has ALREADY forgiven you. The hardest part is to forgive yourself.  3) You ARE human as is the rest of us. There is not one human breathing that has not ever made a mistake. No stones should be thrown here, but people will try to as a diversion from admitting and/or dealing with their own mess ups. Especially by behaving as if YOU'VE carried out the most unforgivable act EVER heard or seen upon the earth. There's been worse before AND since what we witnessed with you. They know it and some of THEM are the ones that did it. That's more about THEM than you. Ignore it.  4) You're doing all that's humanly possible to do.  You did what you did publicly, so ADMITTING the wrong and APOLOGIZING publicly was necessary. I'm sure you've attempted to do it privately as well. 5) Chris now has a choice to forgive ... or not. That's up to him.  6) You ARE NOT a piece of ____. You're a beautiful human being with a heart who is not perfect. You walk, talk, hurt, cry, breathe, bleed, mess up, fall, get back up, go to sleep, and try again tomorrow; just like the rest of us. You just have more people watching than most of us; therefore, you have more self-appointed unqualified judges as well.   Don't continue to worry yourself with what you can't control, especially since others have no control over your destiny. This too shall pass. No one can undo yesterday (only in the movies).   But, we've all had experiences that we WISH we could. Don't allow the world to hold YOU to a standard that they can't even accomplish because IT'S NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE.   I pray that Chris forgives you and your relationship can be healed. However it that doesn't happen, the wiorld is still turning, time is still moving, and life continues to go on. So continue to live yours.❤️
Why did you blame the devil instead of taking full responsibility of it yourself?
my family used to like this man.... but not anymore.
No dislike? This apology video must be really good 😊
Why you all hating him? He said he made a mistak(we all make mistake) and he apologized . What more do you want? You all are not the one who can judge him, let chris accept or not .leave it to chris.
For anyone wondering, there are currently 180,000 dislikes in this video. Keep it up guys.
Your good in my book, always have been. We all make mistakes and you are working to make yours a lesson and that’s great work.
This sounds like an apology video Vladmir Putin would put out there after admitting defeat.
I love you Mr. Will Smith. Don't let the negative thoughts or opinions of others get you down. We can't change certain things in this world. We can't change the past, we can't change peoples perceptions of us, and we can't change what may occur in the future. I believe your apology to be real and beautiful no matter the setting or time frame you did it in. What happened with Chris was unfortunate but there's so much more good that happens in life. There is so much good you have put into this world. I  hope to see you in many more movies, shows, events, youtube videos, etc. There is too much evil occuring in this world to judge anyone and I hope your fans know that.  Other stars have done far worse things honey. I love you dearly sir and wish you the best. Your forever fan, Eyanna Emerald H💛
I can’t even get through this. Will, this is not an apology.
Thanks Will, now go away.
lol he read it like a robot
This is an apology to make yourself feel good about yourself and to make yourself feel you doing the right thing but its not honest at all. I believe honest apologies should happen privately and then you can mention it to people to clear your name (tho if the apology went well you shouldn't have felt the need to make it public if you had been forgiven). But its not gonna cut it. My opinion of you does not matter at the end of the day. what should matter to you is to be true to yourself and figure out what kind of person you want to be and try to do the right thing. I was fan of your family and Based on what I saw on the red table and interviews and stuff.It seems to me you have a strong need to be reassured you are doing the right thing by other people's perseption of what that is not your own. Just go to the theraphy and focus on yourself not on what people want you to be
My man Will talking like a gun pointed at his head  Why. Didn't. I-shit I mean. You. Apologise 🤣🤣
Roflmao
Wow great media training my man put super softness in his voice, wore light colors, a soft light hearted polo and a cap to look more innocent/jovial everything from the colors, fabric, and background has been a depiction of softness.
I'm just sorry Will Smith had to apologize for being human. Sorry to everyone else who is upset that he wasn't the robot you all thought he was with no emotions and human reactions.
What with the water bro? Tacky, tacky.
60 seconds
what a setup
Why weren't you escorted off the premises????
How many shots were necessary for that?
Your still going to need to interview bro this says nothing
perfectly organized, structured and prepared. Professional, and so: sadly heartless
He should of say, he deserve it and end the video
The most expensive apology video of all time
Who’s he apologizing to? Us or Chris? Lol. I know will got that number? “Yo, dude… I’m sorry”. We don’t need this on YouTube stop playing lol
I'm surprised he didn't apologize to me for the meme overkill on my feed
Big Willy is back n action! salute 🫡
Will, you have taken time to work out your issues, and now you have taken the time to apologize. Some will say its not sincere, or just damage control, ect. What's important now is to stop apologizing, anymore apologizing at this point would be you nagging for forced forgiveness. You've made the mistake, you've processed, learned and apologized. Now the ball is in our court to choose how and when we will forgive and what the future beyond that looks like.
this ha 170k dislikes as of today
LOVE YOU WILL❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude won’t apologise about what he said on that day whatever Will said tho
Quit showing off. Retire please.
Lol
It's truly insane how magnificent this "Apology video" that made me shed a tear. It looks like your "4 months" of mental training really made a progress 😳😱
I'm not sure i bought it, but he had enough punishment, it's time to move on.
4:14 We know brother, we know
Good acting mate. Congrats.
❤❤❤❤
we will always love you
One love ❤️ bro.... Is all good 👍
I would accept your apologies.  Life goes on and you have to learn from mistakes ♥️
Bro I hope you see this   For all fall short of the glory of the lord.   It's messed up but through Jesus Christ you can find peace from the total wrath you felt.    People have been shiting on famous people for a while it will not change but Christ will return and fix this broken planet of broken people who put there faith in him.
We love you Uncle Will!

I’ve been a huge fan since the first album. We are human and make mistakes. Time heals so looking forward to the time when you guys shake hands, hug and laugh this off. Peace and love ✌️

Hei @Will, I see that people are kind of flaming here, but at the end of the day, we are all humans and believe it or not these kind of things happen to people who are faimos. I know it happened to me at least once and it isn't easy to appologize once you recognize the amount of pain that you have inflicted directly/indirectly. Will...what happened, happened. You cannot change that, but you can change what will happen in the future by being conscious of what happen and make sure that will never happen again. I grew up watching your movies and you are one of my role models and you will still be my role model because there is still good in your hear and soul. I hope everyone in this chat can also learn something from your experience....and the world will be a better place. :)   Just wanted to show some love Will, because love is the path to healing.  Good luck with rebuilding relationships and I hope to see you shining again!
We know she made you do it. 👿
just because you say sorry people have to forgive or forget.. sometimes you just have to move on with your life… Everyone have to.  No one is perfect, he made a big mistake, now he have to live with the consequences (tarnished image lol)   he said sorry… people dont care.. now just move on.
Ugggg so not funny man
This man is intelligent, funny, and handsome. A triple threat. This situation is actually a blessing in disguise, because it really exposed his haters.... Especially the ones in the industry. The majority of them could care less about Chris. They're just using this to show how they really feel about this ANOINTED man. He's covered by the BLOOD of JESUS. Know that!  🔥TEAM BIG WILLY ALL DAY EVERYDAY🔥
The way we as a society put people on a pedestal and then latch onto their mistakes wanting to destroy their entire life all from the comfort of our homes is disturbing. I hope you never make a mistake because how you judge others is exactly how you deserve to be judged.
Felt like a genuine apology, but all this lighting, multiple angles, and what felt like a crew in the back made it feel so off. If Will did this in his kitchen with just one camera, it wouldn’t be as bad. Also, as soon as anyone drops the “I’m human” line in an apology, it automatically drops it down one level.  I truly do think Will is sorry for what he did, and his wording was well put until that “I’m human,” but all the cameras and what not makes it feel like he’s acting instead of having it be from the heart. One thing to show in your apology is that you’re in a weak state because of what happened (without going overboard), something Will did not do.
Will! 👋🏼
This is not irreparable, it shouldnt be.  If it is we all need to take a long hard look at ourselves, both as individuals and collectively.  Forgiveness should be the cornerstone of all our lives because after all, none of us is innocent, we're sinners and therefore in need of mercy and forgiveness.  But judging by the comments it seems like a lot of people have forgotten this or completely overlooked their own guilt.  Just read the parable of the woman caught in adultery and you'll see yourselves.
People need to stop condemning others for life. What he did was wrong, he is admitting he was wrong, and he is apologizing.  We have to remember most of us were disappointed and shocked. Why, because up until this point he has been a man we have all looked up to and admired for so many years. You can be a good person a great person and make a mistake. No person on this earth is perfect. If we allow it, grow the most from our mistakes.   Will is an example of how you handle a mistake.
Forget this apology…Are we getting a Bel Air Season 2
Whatever you do something, you are  doing it for yourself Let this be a lesson to all of us, because often times we take matters to our own hands on behalf of others thinking they would appreciate what we do for the sake of protecting their images, turns out things dont work like that.   But, it takes a strong person to ask for forgiveness Bravo for your bravery on that.
We love u bro
I wonder how long it’ll take before he turns the comments off
when he morbed at the end I knew he was one of the celebrities of all time
for the people who dont know; the dislikes are at 178k at the moment
We’re all human. Being a huge actor doesn’t exclude you from that fact. We make mistakes. A lot of people don’t try to understand what you may have been going through at the moment you made that decision. Circumstances make us do unexpected things. I hope you find peace dude.  I still look up to you.
BS because he getting broke and need a come back
Y’all talking about it’s not sincere Bc it’s a YouTube video, well where the hell was he supposed to post it at ? Facebook? Ig?
yo chris called saul.
Everybody makes mistakes no matter who you are. Thats how  God made us. So people here saying they will never forgive him and that his is the worst, have also mafe mistakes in their lives but are trying to be better. Its literally so sad to see how many unempathic people are in the comments. Forgivness and kind words go a long term.
Nothing like a white ball behind the white hat. And this guy makes movies not buying it
Surley No one believes this, he's an actor, it's staged Shouldn't have taken this long
Will has now completed the basic youtuber training - apology videos. xD
Will: I’m sorry this got caught on camera. Let me Red Table Talk my way out of this. 😂
It was funny🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Fortnite
If Chris says he's not ready to talk, this is entirely performative and worse than not apologising.
I still got mad love for Will, but there’s a not so genuine feeling about this video. It felt like a kid who was satisfied with his actions but pretended to apologize because his parents told him to. Like he was just making something up on the fly or trying to memorize what he planned to say beforehand.  His best bet is to really go deep and correct this video with a follow up, then wait for Chris to reach out. He just scared soul with this one.
And the award for worst apology ever goes to ....
Love and respect always, Will Smith.🙏❤
What's the dislikes to this
For anyone wondering, video sits at currently 3.1M views with 100k likes to 178k dislikes ratio.
a waste of 5 minutes. a 53 year old acting like a 2 year old in front of billions of people.
no matter what he does. Behind price of belair this is going to be what people remember him for when hes gone.
I really appreciate that my brother. I have been waiting for that moment. Hopefully Chris and his family will accept it.
You did what you through was right at the moment. Take it from here please !!    I will always be a will smith fan.
Top G please respond to this
You changed man, for the worse.
I call bullshit
If someone is fake for long enough... They just forget how to be real.
1 mistake shouldnt define a person especially a man with a clean longevity status. I really hope u can forgive urself ma man the present oppressed world need that Will energy back. ur made for greatness king 🙏
Imagine, youtube apology videos, with a hollywood budget!
Too little too late, totally fake
As I watch this, I find myself wondering if the being sitting on screen emitting an extreme emotionless vocal pattern is a West World reject. It certainly does not appear to be human. The voice and eyes are dead. Woody's 90's pull string voice box has more emotion in his plastic head as he fails to compel fear about the snake in his boot than ersatz Will has managed to conjure in nearly 6 minutes of prattling.  Perhaps a silent Willbot with flash cards spelling out, one word at a time, "The world is sick love is the cure," would have been a better idea. The words obviously are meant to be read as many awkward camera angles to ensure that the picture containing this statement, is in the shot so that you read it at least a couple of times.   Someone thoughtfully and carefully, prominently displayed Jaden's 'Just Water' in this commercial.   The product placement is perfect, sitting on it's own table. The blue of the carton stands out beautifully, meticulously placed within the design of the table, guaranteeing to make it pop. In fact it seems that more time and attention to detail was spent on the placement, lighting, set coordination, and camera angles of the product being marketed in this commercial than on the damn 'apology.'   0/100
Does anyone feel like Will Smith looks puffy in his face?
The video has 179K dislikes. Is he actually speaking the truth because of the good quality seems like scripted. But you never know. In this reality, It's hard to tell which is fake and real. Like cake almost.
Punk as Botch knows his career is over and now he sorry  No sorry what so ever before or directly after.  But definitely sorry his influence and popularity gone  Karma for the ego
boo this man, boo. I hope this follows him forever
This is bs
Maybe you need another 4 months to reconcile asking for forgiveness. When someone you hurt isn’t ready to talk the last thing you do is make a YouTube video. It’s okay being ashamed of yourself when you do something shameful. Sounds like you spent the last 4 months trying to make yourself feel better. 🤦🏽‍♀️
FO Will
Remember guya will its an actor
All this time to decide what he did was wrong? Ffs .
I just came here for the comments🤣
So the world was wrong and Will is the real victim?  Have i got that right? Lol
This is one of the videos I’ve ever seen The words are spoken  The mood is a mood
I need to see some tears then i will believe and accept the apology!!
Shut up Will Smith
No I used to be a fan of will smith and watch all his movies and during the awards I had just accepted him to be my favorite actors but the way he acted was not right.  I will forgive him I see that he is trying but answer me this.  Why did you laugh then all of a sudden go into a rage mode ?? That’s the question and then I will forgive you
Have any of you guys got the dislike extension on....
10/10 apology  10/10 lighting 10/10 story 10/10 script Wow if i was chris i would cry due to how such a good apology this is
I always looked up to you, You did let me down 🤧
Apology video 101 Just don't make one.
This is REALLY random but... The position of that lamp is terrible. Makes it look like he's wearing some stupid hat.
Bullsh*t, she probably made him do it.
Не извиняйтесь, все правильно.
Me vale verga si es robado el discurso, aqui el problema es que el hombre solo se humilla que asco de esposa tiene, que asco me dan los medios y mas me da asco la gente que cree que el humillarse haci y llevarlo a este nivel esta bien cuanta hipocrecia.
CLM ✊🍋
No tienes de que disculparte con los demas, estuvo bien? La verdad es que no las disculpas las debiste de dar haya pero no tienes que humillarte para pedirlas lo que  deberia de hacer este hombre es dejar al horror de esposa que tiene
*178K DISLIKES*  Just let me know in reply if you guys want the update
No pet/s which is just not good minus ten points but everything else looks perfect  Literally reading off a script and sounding like a text to speech bot just a flawless work 9/10
And he’s two faced asf!! I mean look at Gemini man
I swear Will is Legit proving to the world why he’s one of the best actors of all time!
Cada uno pensará lo que quiera pero fue un hecho puntual en sus 30 años de carrera (esos son los que yo lo he seguido como actor). Estuvo mal? Sí. Pero fue un error humano que él entiende como tal. Para mí no ha cambiado mi forma de ver a Will. Todo lo demás es ruido. Ánimo, Will. Tú puedes
We’ll never look at you the same. It is what it is.
Good job reading off of a teleprompter.
Previews are evil.  I used to watch a lot of youtube on my tv.  But now the jumping and jiggly previews make it impossible for me.  It affects my vision, my brain, and makes it painful to try to watch youtube.
honestly, he didnt need to apologize, he was in the right
177k dislikes 😂😂😂
Fake self serving "apology" is worse than no apology.
Why does this seem like he's being held hostage and reading from a telepromter
Will made a mistake. What he did was wrong, but he’s taken the time to reflect and analyse his behaviour. You would all still criticise will and talk bad about him if he didn’t apologise. You all pick and choose what you want from people. Will, I stand with you.
I think they both make mistake for each other, so not only will smith that have to apologize but chris too ^^. I appreciate u will smith
You can tell that he's rehearsed saying this apology
He's finally back in the people's heads, exactly what he wanted. Cheaper than making flop movies...
Will is sorry but don't forget to buy his water
Would love to see the dislikes on this.
"I'm here when you're ready to talk" about 4 months too late for that will smiff
Yo creo que ya está todo dicho WIll. No le des más vueltas. Vive, crea, escribe, trabaja y no te preocupes más. Lo han elevado a una tragedia terrible cuando es poco más que un encontronazo que todos podemos tener. Pasó, te disculpas sinceramente, propósito y enmienda y a seguir. Venga Will. Pasa página y si los demás no lo hacen que sigan viviendo en su falso mundo de algodones y azúcar. Un abrazo.
Imagine waiting MONTHS to apologize publicly, and you pull the victim card. And when it takes you months to try and do like a youtuber apologizing AND STILL doing it badly? Like just take it down before the rest of the populace see's it. Truly, I'm being sincere here, take it down. Dumbest response someone could make in 4 minutes of bare minimum effort. All I saw was a shell of a person on this video, and person is putting it lightly.
current count..........100k likes ...........177k dislikes......
Logan paul tried to apologize on YouTube before. Why did Will think this was a good idea
台灣有小諸葛 美國有黑諸葛!?
Will, you're just a man, like anyone else of us. Except there are plenty more expectations in your person because the people know you and look up to you. I'm German, 37 by now, and am a big fan since the times of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. And even if your reaction to Chris on that evening was not the one I would've expected... who am I to blame you. But for me, your "official" and public apology fixes everything that went wrong on that evening and I deeply hope that Chris will find enough love in his heart to accept your honest apology. It would be great for both of you and your fans.
the f is this
Didn’t even apologize in person
It's your actions dude. It's like your trying to convince yourself. Right now your all the guys in Hitch that you helped. Be yourself. I would have believed this if it was only him.
Fresh Prince of Cuck is back baby!!!
I'm glad you are making peace with Chris with what happened, but I think you also need to lay out a message to the people. Since what happened that night, several of people have attacked comedians on stage, including Dave Chapelle. You are someone people looked up to and still look up to my man. You gotta make things right. Love you man, it sucks this happened, but you have the power to set things right. Be that voice
This just seems like another scripted acting performance.
You’re good in my book King. Everybody makes mistakes because we are all human at the end of day, and the best thing is to learn from it then move on. PEACE MY BROTHER!
for the life of me = i thought the two of you were joking around = seriously
Now I know why they removed the thumbs down 👎 on YouTube videos…
Will smith must've realized he's being blacklisted from getting movie deals and this is why he's apologizing..he's not really sorry for what he did.. he's sorry he can't get paid now
Everyone makes mistakes.  It was wrong and shouldn't have happened but it did.  I think that in the wide world this wasn't the worst thing to ever happen and people need to have a bit of perspective.  I'm sure it feels pretty serious to Will and Chris but everyone else have moved on to the next Hollywood scandal now.
needs at least 50 more sighs for emotional effect
Come on guys everyone have their own mistakes,we are not perfect.Im not backing him up but the pressure that Will  has taken is a lot.Imagine you're at his place and we watch him  trying to fix his past all things that we said is negative eventho he is already repent for what he did.That can't be rite guys.We should help him forgive and forget, support each others so there is no hatred again.Peace i just pity for what he has beeb thru this days.And we should too. I hope you all understand
Weak.
As the big guy himself said. "Never apologize, it’s a sign of weakness”
This just feels like damage control. The way he says, “That wasn’t the right way to react AT THAT TIME,” and stuff like, “no matter how much disrespect,” he’s still sitting in a camp where part of him feels he’s in the right. But it seems like he’s processing it. Maybe the dude can grow, but I don’t think he’s there yet. Hope he gets there. I love Will.
Man trying to get attention now
yea, i forgive you, but i'll never trust u again.
"The world is sick, LOVE is the CURE" in the background is so ironic. Celebrities hypocrisy is my favorite thing in the world
nasty sciontoligy will.
And scene. Go back to your trailer Will.
The judgemental and crucifying tone of so many comments on here, to me, are worse than that of the situation itself. "Forgive them, for they know not what they do" comes to mind. It makes me wonder how much radical personal responsibility is taken by all when we stand by and think mocking another fellow brother in his humaneness is justifiable. It takes an insurmountable amount of courage to ask for forgiveness let alone to forgive oneself. Most of us are lucky enough to not have to be publicly scrutinised and held "accountable"... oh the shame! This is deeper than surface level conflict. This is years of Wounds, trauma and conditioning playing out. And not just by the individuals involved. They are but characters revealing to us all the inhumane treatment we portray towards each other. Personally I thank Will and Chris for being the characters on the world stage showing us all exactly what is wrong in this world. The boxes, structures and thought systems that have been ruling this reality for far too long where one is a victim and another a perpetrator. Even though they are both subtle in projecting their Wounds onto one another. As we all do!!!
Man, you should fire everyone associated with this video.  This is not helping your cause...
Human psychology is complex, and on display even here with the comments.
I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement
Не унижайся. Все правильно сделал.
I can actually relate to this. I am smart, but people expect the better of me. Every mistake gets seen by my brother. My brother caused me to have this habit of being afraid of disappointing someone. Everytime I made a mistake he would repeat it over and over. My teachers taught me to repeat positive things over and over but when something negative repeats my emotions are fragile and I cry. Angry, sad or whatever. It feels like everyone thought I was good but I let them down and made them disappointed and I’m a total idiot standing there, the only one who makes this mistake and everyone had the right to laugh at me.
Notice how: - He doesn't look remotely sad - There are different camera angles, supposing it's a production of sorts - The room he's in looks entirely set up - Man sounds like he's reading off a script
The part where Will said "It's sorry time" had me in tears 😭 Truly one of the apologies ever made
This was no apology, this was damage control.  Will just made a $30 million dollar movie deal and was even paid in advanced.  They're worried how this incident might reflect poorly at the box office.  So, they had him make this video.  Too little, too late!
This is definitely one of the apologies ever.
Frankly don't get all this nosayers saying crap out just because the man using is Youtube channel to apologise.....look at he's side too!
the man apologized, now let it rest
Not sure why so many people find this disingenuous. Does not matter if he did it live, with a big crew, or on a flimsy little webcam. The man apologized, took accountability for his actions. Everyone makes mistakes, we need to be able to give second chances too. Thanks for a reflected and heartfelt apology, Will.
you had all my respect,when i was young till now but go to him 🙃
Who cares
Go find Chris and apologize show him that you care other wish whats the point.
He got weeeeed, He got weeeeed.
AHAHAHAHAHAH LOL You're so full of yourself Will just trying to save your career 😂😂😂😂

My man you’re a problem stop because one person so there is no harm if you divorce and enjoy the rest of your life come on bro
🤥 I just leave it here: https://youtu.be/ykoRgOoyjeo
Why don't we all move on? Is it really that terrible what he did to condemn him for life ?  There's thousands of things done by every day people that are much worse than what he did.
This is better than Logan Paul's apology.
I’ll never get the people who defend him, when those very same people would be arrested and taking off of the property by security if they did the same thing he did.  He’s a rich, entitled, PRIVILEGED celebrity and should be ashamed.
Also, making a fake Halo by putting a globe lamp behind your head in your meticulously framed production is peak Hollywood.
As heartfelt as a piece of wood.
But why is there a mic in the shot
Will I can see passed the words and it does look sincere, I still think something is broken and I really do still think of you as my idol. I hope you can get past what’s eating at you and hope you can continue to bring joy to peoples lives through love and light.
Still no apology for the hosts of the event, 3 women who's night was eclipsed by an unacceptable behaviour.
dude, don't wear merch of your own brand while making an apology video.
Low Life is you will
I apologize to the people of Los Angeles. My behavior has been improper and I accept the consequences. I ask my fellow Angelinos for their patience and understanding. Life here can be difficult for me. After all, I am the only one of my kind. During my incarceration, I will be participating in alcohol and anger management treatment. You deserve better from me. I can be better. I will be better. -Hancock
Lol
I hate seeing this guy distressed. He's one of the good guys man he doesn't deserve to be in that space.
KEEEP MY YOUTUBE'S SITE OUT OF YOUR *******  APOLOGY!
Hope you get the help you need man.
Shamrful Display
Pretty good timing on this apology. Took enough time. We didn't forget about the incident. I am sure you'll be back acting in no time.
Sending healing your way and Chris as well..praying that laps in judgement moment will not cause anymore unnecessary pain and damage..we all have made mistakes and regrets...forgiveness is key for you both.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Why not rather send him a personalized video message instead of the whole world.
AHHHH, it’s rewind time!
This video is unnecessary. He only needs to apologize to Chris. He doesn't owe the public anything.
When he said it's morbin time I just couldn't hold back the tears anymore
👋
bro i didn't see anything wrong with what he did and he did it all in the heat of the moment he is human so let's forget it
Everyone in the world was in the video and it was about everything except the specific apology and regret.
There is no apoloogy needed to give, eveyring that happens at the Academies is staged, because they have to have it set-up up in a way that it runs on time.
Love u will
All he cares about is the fame he's lost, the fact this apology took so long shows how reluctant he really is, he thinks he's more important than others, he should be thrown onto the streets!
😪yeah because even when u came to Philly & my twin & I knew u were going to be at the art museum to film ur music video 20+ years ago,.., we saw u n we were like the first ones out there in the ice & snow & we saw u in a van?,.. but we were too darn shy to approach & it was freezing!!!,.., we took public transportation to be there,.. etc I’ve always admired u but this apology feels real. You took time to reflect &! man•up & apologize to everyone in between. Ty, Will. PS: still want to meet u!!! Pleaseeee
He really said I'm a human and i made a mistake 😂
Just quit already.
Yeah no wonder why Chris doesn't want to talk to you, it took you 4 months lmao
why tell the world of the apology- why have to exhibit oneself for ones wrongdoings? do it in private - makes it more sincere! mo?
Wouldn't it be tragic if Will was just checking to see if Chris had the Horvathian brain tick?
LULZ. TNB is all.
Man’s got a whole camera setup and microphone
🤢
I love you so much 😘😘🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do
This is lame.
nah bro .....🤣
we're lucky he left the comments on
I know he's serious but the comments mad funny tho.
Fake!,
You know you are a king when your apology is still trending after 3 days. That's INFLUENCE.
This was even less necessary but more painful to watch than the Fresh Prince of Bel Air reboot...
There's only a couple things you could do that would make me forgive you if I was in his shoes, and making this video, like this, and without me in it isn't one of them my guy. The ball's in Chris' court now though, let's see how he responds. Being that I'm NOT in his shoes, I'M good! I love both of y'all niggas, but don't ever do nothin like that again. Unless it's in a movie. LOL!
An apology to a person shouldn’t even be public if it’s real. This should be done without camera. Chris did say to him that Chris will talk to him when he’s ready. Can he just wait till that time and apologise in person, why the rush? Thought healing and self reflect need time? This feel force upon Chris. I bet Chris feel the pressure to answer sooner.
"He's not ready to talk. When he is, he'll reach out." Narrator: "Chris did not reach out."
#CLM 🍋✊
scripted AF and more corny than amber turd's crocodile tears in court room.
4 Months too late
God will strengthen you, and he has forgiven you and Chris will also eventually for his own peace❤️
say sorry to yourselves for defending that woman.
Will smith has been through some stuff since the past months
this is worse than logan paul
He made things worse with this video. He should get a divorce, retire, become a monk somewhere isolated, and come back as a pet detective… then maybe my dog will like you.
if only he had that neuralyzer
Beta male 100%
Sometimes we all need to be forgiven for the mistakes we make. Especially our biggest ones.
Your wife’s boyfriend is almost home, Will. Time for bed.
Stuff happens move on, its no big thing just a thing .
i love the comments saying "it's not our place to forgive will, that's for chris to do" like i totally agree but the last time i saw that was fedmyster LMAO
We watch from the shadows, but now we take the stage! ✊ #CLM
Where was this months ago? Looks like a sad final plea to save your self
Will Shrimp
me after my mom asks me why I'm "sleeping" with my phone still in my hand: 0:30
"I am sorry to my sponsors. Please pay me money again."
Yet you did. Out you go. Ain’t got time for you or your words.

He did keep his Wife’s name out of us mouth
You fucked up. That’s all there is to it. Nobody has to forgive you. The only person who can figure out how to solve this is yourself, and maybe you don’t need to share that with all of us.   Figure yourself out.
I expected more . As a comedian yourself , how would you feel about someone popping your jaw for something you said on stage working. You insulted the role of a comedian by crossing the line with physical pain for someone trying to be funny. Pathetic of you . I would like to hear you dig a little deeper . I love you man .
if you have the youtube dislike button extension, it has 174k dislikes 💀
Espero que ele te perdoe você é um cara da hora.
And in my eyes he will always be. One of the greatest actors of our time!
Not buying what you selling. This is just sad. I can’t even…Bro’ you need a new PR team cause the one you got either sucks or ou not listening to them.
He made a good meme about it
bro... why? This was months ago, and your apology is the same generic thing we see from every youtuber, down to the sitting down sighing opening scene. You were doing just fine laying low and handling the matter personally. Whoever told you to make this needs to be fired.
sad u cant see the downvotes id love to see the number lol
*I love how he's so genuine and legitimate here, now that's a real Youtuber right there*
Fake
L SMITH
Inner Work needed Nothing personal  Will, next
This makes Travis Scott's Astroworld apology video look sincere. At least Scott's video was done immediately after and without the shameless product placement.
I have had a moment or two in my life where I acted upon something without thinking & just surrendered to the moment & that's what I feel like you did. Once I was on my way to doing it my mind was blank & I just went with it, almost as if it was expected of me but without thinking. I was embarrassed & I let it get to me for a minute but what I did wasn't broadcast to the world though so I was able to regret it, learn from it & move on. I wish it was that easy for you. For what it's worth I still have love for you & wish you the best.
❤❤❤❤

Sometimes the apology never comes when it is wanted  And when it comes it is neither wanted or needed                              -  You are too late.
bad move Mr. Smith, the internet don't like apology videos, this needed to be said in private.
What I'm finding really sad is all the sinners casting stones in this toxic comment section.
Shame on the 247K who disliked this video.
nahhhh Mr. Smith   ...... im good!
I accept your apology ☺️🇱🇷
This is almost as emotional as the YouTube rewind and Morbius combined.
When you use three cameras, lighting, audio effects, product placement, and still don’t say “I’m sorry” to another man, that’s how you know its legit.
I just watched Will Smith being interviewed by David Letterman. I wanted to wait to see that interview until I was ready to hear it. I would like to remind Will that although he has lost much due to his actions, he still has the ability to reclaim his future. He should continue to give back to the world as he had been doing. His charities, documentaries, productions, music and movies make this world tolerable.  He just needs to do it slowly and give without expecting any reward and the goodness he sends out will help heal. I can see he's in therapy and I want him to know I am praying and cheering him on. You've apologized, now continue your journey and when you are ready I'll be waiting with anticipation.
So fake
I dont care what he did....he is the best black men out there representing the black man ...  You will always be great will...they just trying to bring you down
Love u will
He completely thinks that was the right thing to do
But Will it blend?
Čøçķ
Now we gone make like a tree, and leave!
Will could really use that flashy thingy(to wipeout memory) from Man In Black.
That last part of making promises just put himself back into a rut of people pleasing and pursuing perfection to never disappoint. You had a human moment, and people will have to live with the fact that it disappointed them, but you cannot spend your days making it up to millions of people. Don’t put yourself through that. Now that you got to be seen human, breath, and rebuild with some realistic grace with yourself. There is humility in accepting that you may mess up again and that’s okay. Even if the actions aren’t okay, the humanity of the need for grace for your mess ups as you learn the lessons is allowed and inescapable. You are still love worthy without the promise of perfection.
Fake, pre planned
Boooooo!
It's not the event that defines a man.  It is the way he responds to the event.
I thought he was going to “flashy thing us” in this video.
You see how he keeps looking at the bottom right corner, bet he’s reading lines LOL
Show me a video of playing a victim without playing a victim. Great mea culpa video, Will. I’m going drink a carton of Just Water now.
Why they didn't tell him that bulb behind his head please I thought he was a super Mario brother for a minute 🤣
its been a minute... yet its 5 minutes
"I've made a severe and continuous lapse of my judgement and I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm simply here to apologise."
A good apology acknowledges all the pain that was caused to all the people by your decision to act the way you did.                   A bad apology is when you simply say it was wrong to act the way you did.   A good apology is about the people you hurt.  It's not about you.                       I hope this is water under the bridge soon.....cuz Will's a good actor and Chris is a great Comedian.
Imagine not knowing Eugene 🤓🤯
he did better in hancock.
*more than 3 million views and 99k likes, you can guess how big is the dislike bar*
"Blah, blah, blah..." - Will Smith, 2022.
I am still a fan but your actions were definitely not cool. This was a big moment for you that got ruin.  The entertainment industry is not going to allow you back anytime soon.  I don't know if any apology is going to work.  I DO PRAY THINGS WORK OUT FOR YOU WIL!
He only made this video so he would get more subs 😏
Will you are no longer a man, this apology is fake and you only want the backlash to stop and now you have only added fuel to the fire . This is an ad for your son's water company, and for being an actor this is a horrible performance.
Your apology could use a bit more emotion and sincerity seriously a couple of months and still the apology don’t look or feel like one ……Why can’t you just don’t listen to what is around you are who for that matter and just speak from your heart…….maybe then Chris will hear what you have to say try that speak your mind in your way Will Smith because for a actor that I love and look up to am telling you right now that your face and body language is not on the same terms
HAHA!!! Desperately trying to do a little spiffing up in advance of beginning work on that shiny new movie deal and hoping to win over the public before it premiers 🤪
Man he could have got Col H. Stinkmeaner to give a better apology than that.
I’m on a whiskey diet. I’ve lost three days already.

You knew just what you were trying to do in that moment.
a
I like how he reads the questions slowly like a retard, to make us believe it's the first time he reads them and doesn't know what's coming. Yeah Will, we're that stupid. Go to therapy. A real one. You need it.
I could only watch the first minute before I felt like I was going to throw up.
He reads questions in the tone my mom used when she asked me for the second time who I was out with at 2am on a school night.
This is so corny. Not genuine. No remorse. No humility. So fake. This does not come across legit.
This is one of the apology videos of all time
Please love me again Hollywood
The first time we see this man in months, and hes responding to comments on his YT page. Get ur views up!  Martin>Fresh Prince
Morbius morbillion
And the award for the most generic YouTube performance💤💤💤 during a supposedly heartfelt apology video containing subliminal advertising goes to…  🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻
Almost like he's memorising what to say on a script
Was this your wifes idea???
I know he meant for this to be serious, but I'm sorry, there's no way this'll avoid spawning memes
too late bro you’re washed
It is my hope that people do not judge my entire life and my entire contribution to the world by one brief moment of regrettable behavior.
“Trying to be remorseful without being ashamed” great point
all good, keep making good movies
Son you lucky they don’t show the dislikes anymore
Man I'd love to see the dislikes on this one
Did he even directly apologize to Chris in this?
Estás súper manipulado por tu esposa
I don't get how this is an bad apology
Eww
This guy deserves nothing less than a lawsuit
Just a reminder that Andrew Garfield lost to the man in the video?
Love Will but there is an obvious disconnect here. Will let's chitty chat over zoom and we can post that instead, let's get real.
Will actually made me some money, I sold all my blu rays with him in it.
praying for all parties involved.
I still love and respect you, Will Smith. We're all human. None of us are perfect. We all make mistakes. What you did just proves you're human like the rest of us. I'm sending my love and prayers hoping that this gets worked out for the best for everyone involved.                ❤&🙏🏻
This apology is not for Chris, Smith will do it when he have the chance and they're on the one-on-one. This apology is for the public because you guys love some drama and a cancelation party, and as an actor his public image is also his brand. It must be draining to live a career that put you in the spotlight and then the consequences of you mistakes involve a high number of people, humans like to gang up
no one is perfect Everyone can make mistakes. The key is to repent and forgive. (I will always be by your side.)✌️✌️✌️
He seems really genuine about this apology I hope you 2 make up
Psalm 51:2-4 Wash away all my iniquity     and cleanse me from my sin.  For I know my transgressions,     and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned     and done what is evil in your sight so you are right in your verdict     and justified when you judge
Oh shush....
If only we could see the dislike ratio
🍐
You should have just said that you were in Pizza Express in Woking.  Works every time 👍🏻
Well it has actually been more than a minute, it’s been 4 months-🤓
All bullies are really cowards.  Will Smith is both.  And, apologizing to a camera is not an apology.  You should have done this months ago instead of making excuses.
ウィル元気ですか？あなたの映画を見て育ってきた者の一人です。日本から応援しています。
Will looking for that neuralyzer rn
Lol he even got the deep breath release down.
I will always be by your side.
You are right Will, a sorry is not enough. Yes, you let us down. I wish you all the best and I hope you find peace.
We are all humans and are prone to make mistakes.
Did you also make a severe and continuous lapse in your judgement?
Used to love you. NOT anymore. Lost the respect and admiration in that awful night, and now, with this horrible video, am completely done. This “apology” It's so hypocritical that insults anyone's intelligence. Awful. Start to respect yourself, coward emasculated man
BETA!!!!!
Matriculation complete....Commence ascension!!..
what a b!tch not a man at all.👎so you know
I have always loved Will Smith's acting. I even thought he seemed like a decent person before. But it's hard not to doubt his sincerity here.
Toxic women drive you to extremes and makes you doubt/question everything bubba.  We have all been there as grown middle aged men that are with women more then not.  Love makes you the best and the worst man at times.
I want to know why you think you have the right to do that to someone.
Keep slappin Will 🤚
I'm proud of you Will for apologizing now ask GOD to forgive you and And Son think before you act he's is your brother and don't you do that ever again from a 78 year old grandma 😘 take care of yourself blessings to you and yours
I'm able to see dislikes and for those of you wondering, this video has 99k likes and 178k dislikes
hahahah L
I mean u are just a human, mistakes are made move on and live with the scars
I don't remember this scene in Men in Black
It takes a big man.
Rich Lux watch out!!! Will's about to take the spot of Queen Drama channel!!!
As a fan You have my forgiveness will Smith
wait lemme predict the video rq ( i havent watched it ) so its probably a sigh a "i dont want to make this video" and usually a dog but i dont see a dog so far
Bro, ya basta por favor. No tienes nada de que disculparte; ellos deberían ser los que se disculpen por hacer un río de un charco, aprovechándose de tu fama.   Así que ya basta de disculpas y consíguete otra mujer que si te apoye públicamente cuando te hacen una guarrada así xd
I vote authentic, but yea, a lot of consultations
“Yaaaahhhhhh, it’s rewind time”
Hey guys I just wanted to let you know Jesus Christ died for our sins and he’s coming back soon. He  loves you so much and will give you eternal life with Him if you believe in Him, repent of your sins and follow him! God thinks about you 24/7 and is waiting for you to come home! Turn away from this world and turn to God! The LORD wants you!!
its been a year daddy
Will is learning from James Charles and Logan Paul
what about the question, what the hell where u thinking???????!!!!!!
I see that subtle water placement Will lmao
Tbh will I never really was mad about the smack I don’t understand why everyone hated it
The proper way is to say "I am sorry for my behavior and my action that night". NOT,  "I want to apologize... ".
Have some pride, go and retire with your earned millions, give space for the next generation of actors who will hopefully know how to treat other human beings with respect.
its almost like he's acting
👌👌
Who asked?
What’s the dislikes?
Lmao
could of sworn an apology video is supposed to have some kind of random dog come in, and some kind of Iphone giveaway at the end
The perfect YouTube apology video doesn't exi-
How come when I search will smith apology I don’t find it but when I search 1 minute song timers I find it?
No part of you, that thinks what you did is OK.  But you did it.  lol
is it the best apology? no is it better than most youtube apology? well... kinda i guess
Would have been far better off if he'd not made this "Apology" video.
This is such a apology. This really is a apology. It truly does exist.
Imagine not knowing Eugene
I have no respect left for you will
Hey Will, if you're reading this, I gotta say you redeemed yourself, and it shows how you have a good heart, it's the way to show the world that people can apologize and free their souls from hate.
There are no 'complexities' or 'nuances' (this shows that you haven't really taken ownership)....take ownership 100%.  You have major issues that need to be addressed....I would suggest getting out of Hollywood and live a regular life (like the rest of us), the behavior is disconcerting.
We love you
him and chris are friends thats why, people watching on tv dont understand how close they really are
Lol suge smiths!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That Hall of Shame has a new enductee ~ congratulatyons Mz Smith
This is not genuine at all!!
He just keeps embarrassing himself
Seems fake
172k dislikes haha
Will, this is causing me to have conflicting feels. I grew up with you crushing it, but what you did to Chris due to your marital issues, is not ok.
Best thing for Will to do is get out of the toxicity of Hollywood. Become real again and leave the crap behind. 🇨🇦👀
Okay
If you hating on this, you ain grown up
“I was fogged out. It’s all fuzzy.” What a tool.
171,000 Dislikes thus far
I'm impressed that you understand that an apology is meaningless without working on yourself, that you need to make changes, working towards it not happening ever again, and working to make amends.
I threw all my DVD's I have of you in the garage along with my respect
Keep your head up Will.
How many takes and edits did this disingenuous performance require?
Everybody haaaaates Chriiiiiisss
I was always your friend!
Difícil acreditar q isso acontece logo da pessoa WILL SMITH, Q DOIDEIRA
I find it interesting that he listed all of the people that he *wanted* to apologise to, but only actually said "I'm sorry" to his family members.
For people who are wondering how many dislikes there are, video has 171K dislikes.
Will should play Jessie in the smollet stories
I've never seen an apology mixed in with a Q&A before
Wtf is this will
Love u Will, everything it’ll go better I am sure ❤️
Will Smith's apology video is odd. I would have started off with a more sincere apology.  Also, saying 'I apologize to you" is very distancing. An "I'm sorry for what I did & how I reacted"  sound more from the heart and less stand-off. His voice sounded more sympathetic towards Chris Rock's mother than him...A lot of this sounds like a word salad of fluff.
lol.
Is it Dirtbag or Dirt Bag?
He would do it again. If she gave the go ahead again. This is so fake to me
Ahora a seguir haciendo todas esas peliculas que tanto disfrutamos.
when an actor apologises...... oh please
The comments let me know how truly lost we are as a species. SMH! The end HAS to be near. I'm sick of human beings.
Someone had to say this — a small percentage of the people in these comments could actually handle the pressure to acknowledge some of their biggest mistakes in front of the world.   The fact that he displayed the courage to show up, speak truth, and show that he’s not perfect should be an indication to everyone who has F-ed up (all of us) that you may have made mistake but you aren’t a piece of 💩   That is all ❤️
I can't believe people are buying this bs.. literally jacked that seen from a movie
Sorry, no interest in being your friend. This was the kind of incident that reveals someone's personality to an extent that there is no turning back. The "Nice Guy" veil has vanished.
Will i was a big fan . The day you did that ill never look at you the same way.
I believe in you.
The sign ( the world is sick, love is the cure ) 👌very appropriate 😂
I was truly disappointed in you Will. I NEVER expected that from you. I hope to one day also forgive you for taking away someone I truly looked up to. I hope you and Chris make peace with each other and that you truly learn from this long lasting moment in your life.
IF SHES HAPPY IM HAPPY!!! STAY STRONG BROTHER 🍋✊ #CLM

I’m Surprised He Did This.
I can’t tell you how much I OVERstand trauma responses and how the response to trauma can be impulsive and we then have to live with the damage. I hope all parties involved can find some common ground and move past this. You are still loved by many. God bless you all 💜
You did the right thing on that moment. We all have the right to fight for our family. If someone said you did wrong those people was getting intertaind by someone's sickly condition.  Comedy is a good way to give the people some happy moments . But target some individuals are not comedy it is childess behavior.
Dude I love you but cmon 4 months? Get serious
So basically he said all of that to say he’s playing the new black panther
One  has  to feel 'Shame" if One truly is Sorry. This sounds of her Reteric.
Bet his apology to her was way more sincere . This ain't over.
She didn't "Verbally" tell him. He knew, from the past, if he didn't, she w/give him heck.
🐐
Always respected Will Smith. Probably Always will. He has shown humility, and reflection. Hopefully Chris can have that talk with him one day., and they can make amends.
Who cares about what people think about you now? You're Will Smith!!! You're an American legend man!!!
will remember you don't owe anyone anything in life but yourself
As a long time fan it was messed up man.  I get it, but like you said it wasn't the right way to handle it.  Forget the haters here, just keep trying to do better man.
Most fake apology of all time, congratulations 👏👏👏
We got your back Will. It is what it is. A lot of would have done the same. We are all human. Prayers for u and your family. Your a good man!
He's Still one of my favorite actors and a personal hero of mine..
I apologize isn't the same as asking forgiveness.  I have had to learn this myself, and it's humbling.  I don't know if posting a youtube video is the right way to go.  I am praying that you both can reconcile.
This better not end till we get a boxing fight between the both of y’all
What an entaglement this is.....

Emotional regulation is a huge part of ADHD.  I'm not sure if he's officially diagnosed but as a person with ADHD I can see it in him a mile away.  There is help, I can see that he wants to do right but sometimes our brains just can't function the way we want and even with all the safety nets surrounding us we sometimes break through the cracks. With treatment, I can now regulate my emotions better, I'm less impulsive, and quiet my mind.  It has improved my relationships and I'm more creative than ever since I can focus at the task at hand.  I'm still ADHD but can manage it much easier.
It's strength to apologize sometimes and say what you said! and you are the man that has great personality, example, thinker, sense of humor, behaviors, and morals. It's good seeing you my friend and brother
He's human just like everyone else..he made a mistake and I feel he really regrets what he did..I still think he's one of the best!! Good luck will!
Why it took you so long to apologize 🤨
He even got the sigh down perfectly this is the king of all youtuber apologies
Love you Will, we all make mistakes, love you and I love chris too
Just another Hollywood fake. Big surprise.
booooo!   Im just here to pitch in my useless 2 cents and not watch this video
Uncle Phil is looking down disappointed.  On national tv!? cmon man!
Unforgiven
Any one else see the link to buy his book right under this video? Hahahaha what a sham 😂😂
I don't really know Will other than his movies but it sure seems like he reading from a script and it doesn't feel real to me, why didn't just wait for Christ to reach out and just those two discuss/work it out, just my thought, peace!
Man f*<% that we still love you Will no love lost 🐐
Will you need Jesus in your life, 😉
Will is the living embodiment of money isn't everything. Money can make your life a lot better but if the other pieces of your life aren't straight you can still be very miserable.
Nah Bruh you Out of Pocket!
Listen, I know it was a regretful moment in your life, we all make mistakes. I think everyone should regard your entire body of work, including your motivational messages and not just 10 seconds on TV.  Love to you and your family, Will. God bless you, Tricia.
Should of read “Dear YouTube”
He looks like he's forced to do this. Can see it in his eyes.
This is dumb 🤨
Deberías ver el vídeo de Dalas, el te recomendaría qué haces para mejorar tu carrera y tu vida
This had a bigger budget than the first paranormal activity.
I wonder what them dislikes look like👀
I came here for the comment section
Goodbye Will.  There was a time I respected you.
Will smith is so excusable
You know society if upside down when one of the most loved actors of almost two generations is doing this.
You’re only human. It happened and you did everything you could to amend your mistake. Be kind to yourself and look at the solution to move forward for yourself and for your community’s spirit. Best wishes.
Well this whole situation certainly isn’t a MASSIVE publicity stunt 🙄🙄🙄🤣🤣
Damage is permanent. Shame.
You know, we all have moments we wish we could take back. Some of us understand that it was out of character for Will. It's also difficult to live with ourselves after making a hurtful decision. NOBODY is an exception. People need to stop casting stones.
What he really needs to do is to divorce that horrible woman he is with.
For those who don't use the dislike filter he is currently 170k of dislike. Say a lot about it.
Why does Will sound like that one kid who gets popcorned to read in class?
Bro. Leave that woman, this video hasn't been the right thing to do, you don't need to apologize so much.
Jamie Foxx is a better actor, entertainer, singer... better in every single thing he does. So in my book this guy can f out of any movie,any movie... Just put Jamie Foxx in  Smith's place and let the show go on.
It's who you are. You need to forgive yourself, but you can't expect the same from the rest of the world. And you have to be OK with that and carry on.
You weren't "deeply committed" to bringing light and joy to the world when you smacked a man In front of all those people...
He's trying to keep loving a complete narcissist and that is why he will continue to fail. The sad thing is, he really does love her but she doesn't really love him. He has some serious psychological issues with love and women.
I really appreciate this!! It does mean a lot to the people that looked up to you to see you do this. Thank you for taking the time for this.
It's been a minute, alright. I ought to admit, it's been fuzzy for me for the rest of the show. I don't even remember how it ended. Jada's rolling eyes is the last thing I remember. I had to go to see a doctor for my memory laps. They are still trying to figure things out...
You know that woman just off screen forcing you to do this video… leave her already! Reclaim your dignity! YOU’RE WILL F’n SMITH FFS!
Apology accepted
L
Sounds like someone's publicists wrote that.
Ehhh.. Glad your fake apology is working on most people, I guess lol
omfg this is the longest 5:44 video ive ever watched goddamn he talks so slow and robotic
Estas disculpas son tuyas o de tu publicista que falso eres
I can't believe this. How many men cry during a apology? None.
I just love Will's voice. 😊 You know it's him whenever he talks, off screen or on screen or whatever but you know it's him. 😍😄 Just a very distinctive voice. 💚 I love you Will. You will get thru this. Your fans will never leave you. This apology makes you even more of a beautiful spirit than what already viewed as. You're human, as we all are. We have human emotions that can overtake and become action. I thought your apology was beautiful. 💚
I apologize, also, go buy my son’s water.
I believe in your will, you will always be the person I admire the most, many of us have relapses, personally you helped me to overcome them.... I hope everything works out. We love you <3
Damn... I ought to admit, I stopped the video 3 seconds in to post my first comment. Then I watched the video to the end. Dude, you're only 6-7 years me junior and a gazillion of USD more successful. Yet, I'm having hard time to comprehend your reaction. The only thing I can contribute it to is the difference in the level of testosterone between you and me. Trust me, it's a significant one. Too bad it has taken you that long to apologize.
This is nice, but can we please talk about the political and economic state of the world real quick
he's a liаr! it's been not a minute! it's been months!
I call BS
Can we just talk about the political and economical state of the world right now ?
i thought it was horrible.. and he had a hard time even reading the questions or acting sincere... hopefully he does better when he is reading for a part in a movie
I respected what you've done .. i respected how you do your best to save your family, also it's a feeling n u have the right as a human being to accept or reject an action. You shouldn't be judged too much 🤷
I miss the days when Will was making little old grannies get jiggy with it.
❤️❤️❤️
Forgiveness heals everyone, and one moment doesn't define who you are. I get up everyday with the best of intentions and the world comes into my life and shows me it doesn't care. Be the best man you can be for you, for your family and for God who really blessed you, forgetting him is the biggest mistake you can make that you can't fix. Your a good man Will Smith ....

Clearly none of the comments here has a brain to understand how an apology is meant to be like & how you even make one.
Deja a la esposa Will 8v
Its Okay Will we still love you. love from Maine
You disappointed me.  You were my hero.  Now you are nothing.  I will never watch another of your movies.
Why did it take three months?… it’s the talk of a narcissist that doesn’t take any responsibility in this video! So much double talk and word salad… if you meant any of this you would have apologized as soon as it happened and it would be simple. “I’m sorry to Chris, I’m sorry to my fans. lost my head, it was a terrible moment for me. It will never happen again”
If only we could see the dislikes
I wonder what was between all the jump cuts ?
"Central Trauma" Buzzword you pay tons of money from a celebrity psychiatrist/psychologist for.
What? Almost 10M of subscribers? Well, I guess, I'm in the wrong neighbourhood.
Força Will isso vai passar
this is a man who is hurting, for what he is hurting from, is just between him and his own council, he should not be judged any more, it should be over...there is so much more going on in the world today, enough judgement... God does not judge so why do we as a human Race...!
Why does it feel she wrote your scriot.... It's sad to see tht yu are still jn darkness
We all make mistakes, and if anybody is worth redemption it’s Will Smith. I believe his apology was sincere, and I hope Will continues to stay strong. yes, he had a bad moment, but that doesn’t take away from his life time of motivating and inspiring people around the world.  I believe that you and Chris will move pass this, and perhaps have a stronger bond because of this. Keep your head up, and know that you are loved!
I think Will Smith officially became a youtuber
🍋 ✊️ CLM WE STAND WITH YOU LOUD AND PROUD KING emoney7
Why is he wearing a Wario hat?
I accept your apology, thanks for having the decency to do so. Those who bash a man for apologising just love the drama and want to encourage it, if you wanted to encourage peace you wouldn't be posting that stupid CLM crap.  We live, we make mistakes, we learn, and we grow.
This apology is as moving as the movie Morbius. Truly, a thing that exists.
Me when 60 seconds pass
Great acting from a great actor..no more or less.
Ok but seriously, so many celebrities has also done stupid things like this (I know this wasn’t right of him but still) everyone is still mad at him even if it has been many months since it happened, and yes he did a stupid thing but he atleast apologized. Please just give him a chance.
Deleting YouTube for recommending this
When the video opens up with a picture of the world is sick love is the cure you know wills team have been working hard.
Lie lie lie... Will's movie works arent good. Now he seems like a Angel 😆Will, you are a very big liar... Give up to say lie. You must learn to be show respect yourself
Pos.
the like to dislike ratio is amazing
You can’t apologize for an act of this nature MONTHS later. This is some bullshhhh to see how we the public feel about you, it’s a feeler. You need to remove yourself from the union you’re in because it seems to be one sided and all the weight seems to be on your shoulders. From the statements she puts out publicly to the lack of taking any responsibility for this situation, it’s just baaaaad bro. SMH.
4 months of training really paid off. Classic youtuber apology sigh at the start. Good job Will!
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” “Love prospers when a fault is forgiven, but dwelling on it separates close friends.”

Никому не стоит так глумиться, тем более над теми, кто не может за себя постоять. Уилл- ты настоящий мужик и не стоит извиняться за то, что защищаешь свою семью или будешь также защищать когда-нибудь того, кому это необходимо. Мы с тобой, ты- красавчик и все будет збс!!!
What a bunch of self-serving crap. Poor whiny baby!
I AM READING THIS QQUESTION FOR THE VERY FIRST TTIME
If I were Chris, I would never talk to this guy again. The hell with him and his family.
Damage control, for PR. How lame.
"There's no part of me that thinks that is an optimal way to handle disrespect" He forgets the notable exception of his brain.
Oh dear

Honestly feel bad for Will.
Fake apology
This video had it all: heavy script, multiple cameras, a crew, product placement, self justification, laughter during what should have been a serious thing. Everything except the words “I’m sorry Chris”.  Saying “I apologize to you”, is not an apology. “I’m sorry” is an apology. “I apologize” is like telling your spouse “I express fond feelings” rather than saying “I love you”.  Also, didn’t this happen like 2 months ago? Far too little, far too late.

I still like Will & I think it’s cool that he is a real man who fights for his woman although this does not fit into the political correctness spectrum.
Nah, I ain't hanging on. I don't want to be friends again, Will.
Too Late
this video has a script, a crew, lighting, multiple cameras, product placement and probably a budget. THATS HOW YOU KNOW ITS SINCERE
Will once said his father put him to build a wall/ fence after school, it looks like he build that wall too high or he needs to go back and reflect on what was his thoughts during that process, something is missing (empathy). A sincere apology starts with - I am sorry, in my opinion. But its a start!
Is this season 2 deep from the boys wearing a Will Smith suit?
168k dislikes goddamn...
Just be real. This is so forced.
Are you apologizing because no one wants to work with you?
It’s rewind time
The beginning of Will Smith's youtube channel. The Smith Family.
You've Done a Wonderful thing by Apologizing. Will, now it's time for you to let it go and give it up to God and Live Your Life. Remember to ask God to Forgive You. That is the most important thing. Your Soul and God's Grace will be your refuge always. You are Loved Always♥️ I Love You♥️ God Loves You♥️
Уиил ты сделал все правильно. За что ты просишь прощения? Он как мужик оскорбил твою любовь мать твоих детей. А ты как мужик ответил ему. Ещё и мягко это сделал. Пусть он попросит прощения у твоей супруги и своей матери и сестер что позволил себе такие шутки над женщиной которая болеет и вообще над чьей-то супругой. Broo translation
4 months to an apology? Hum, very interesting. Everybody knows that this is not an apology for Chris, he is trying to apologise to his fans.
Well, it’s okay to feel ashamed for your behavior. It was very shameful moment in entertainment HISTORY.
I hear laughing during a serious apology always makes it seem more heartfelt.
Half of the comedic world still dunking on Will. Chris won’t be picking up any phone calls.
"If you have got something in your mind. It should come out of your mouth."
I think will does mean sorry but he’s also having a hard time with it still. I dunno.
I had a vision I saw will Smith I saw his face and upper body and under him I read this will I AM. I believe The God Of The Bible Is Calling him to save his soul from the fires of hell
“Will smith don’t gotta cuss in his raps to sell records. Well I do. So f him and f u too.”  -Eminem
.
this is the apology ever
@Hatchethaz I agree
People still follow Will Smith?
Even the best of people can let you down at times. Me, I look at their conduct over time, they’re ability to admit when they’re wrong, apologize and strive to do better. I’m not mad at him, pick yourself up and keep going sir. We love you. ✊🏾
The only way people will forget about this is if Chris comes out and says it's cool. Or even better, have them both on camera together. I don't see this happening.
If Will Smith was truly remorseful, he would have apologized to Chris the same night. This is just acting. Now I would never watch his films ever again.
Painful to watch… this is coming now after all those month? Why public when Chris is not interested yet and why so self centered. It all about publicity. This all comes across as fake, staged and not genuine. I will no longer watch your movies. Not the optimal way? Wow, what’s the optimal way to respond?
Sincere apology is instant and heartfelt and not with a camera in front of you
why mfkers always gotta sigh.
This was a trash apology went on a whole set and read a script. On his YouTube should of did it in private, this is just a attempt to clear up and address the situation and memes and internet crap. Like Travis Scott.
I still love you! It happens people aren’t brave enough to do what y’all feel bc of their celebrity “status” foh! Good for u and good god your apology! Take his apology or leave it
Yesss, apology content. Deep breath: check Coming out of frame: check Sitting down: check “I want to apologise to”: check “I’ve spent the last few months/time/days”: check “I’ve made a mistake”: check Dog or other animal: huge lack of dog Crying on camera: not even a single tear Yeah, terrible apology 4/10
Someone else definitely wrote this script for him
So Chris is not ready to talk to you about this yet, so in true Narcissistic style, you completely disrespect his wishes in your need to control the situation, and talk about this publicly instead.  We see through you Will, this was about you making yourself feel better, not because you are truly sorry.
You good Chris. You good.
Can anyone donate some money to buy a home for my family? I'm from India.
Cant believe this hero protected his son's friend's girl as he should have! Maybe she'll let you stay in the room and watch in the future!
Well good 2 see you can still act,because an act it is.
Good acting

Olá Sr. Will sou seu fã, deve ser difícil pelo que está passando. torço para que passe o mais rápido possível e o senhor possa voltar a brilhar novamente nas telonas .
thank you for acknowledging your mistake 👏🏽
Entitled celebrities are getting on my nerves. I think the whole Smith family needs to be humbled, and then healed. That being said, who among us has not made a bad decision.
Hi Will from Canary Islands , Spain. Enough. You did wrong and you apologized for it. And it was not such a big deal. Life just goes on. Spanish people love you, as you are. With your ups and downs, with your lights and shadows. Like everyone...

You’re human, Will. Long as Chris is good and you’re good, it’s alright. You just have to forgive yourself.
Surprised he didn't turn the comments off.
You can see Jadas shadow behind the camera with a script for Will
I'm sorry because i have two movies waitings and I have no money right now I need to say sorry to see the sun come out...
I like how you ruined your life's reputation in a few seconds lol
still, nobody is watching his movie anymore
I love you will and I'm sorry for what you're going through  your true fans know you and want leave you
Am glad you apologized it was shocking to see what you did on tv

I lost all my respect for will Smith
what does the clm and lemon fist in the comments stand for?
What is clm lemon
Maybe Will wants to apologize to Chris to his face rather than on YouTube. He's said that Chris isn't ready for that so with due time that apology will come. The ball is now in Chris's yard he gets to decide when he speaks to Will and when and if Will can be forgiven. Its not up to us to determine whether or not the apology is genuine its up to Chris to decide that.
I wasn't there nor do I know the precise circumstances around what happened. Don't need to in order to know what happened shouldn't have happened. That being said, this is one of the most self aware and honest apologies I have ever seen come out of Hollywood and I can tell he isn't just acting. It is sincere, I believe he understands the impact and will carry that understanding forward with him. I think it's time to close the book on this one. Good job
Too late Will
You are still an hypocrite... and nothing you can do will change that...
“He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone”                                              John 8:7
I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or su*cide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you
The monney is missing hurry up save the planet with good vibes lmfao
This is the most sincere apology That I have ever heard from anyone I see on public media. But I do want to say that the only standards and expectations that you need to live by belongs to God. When you get it right with God, everything else will fall into right perspective. People will still be offended regardless of what you do, but as long as you get it right with God and continue to recognize and admit where you went wrong, then you will have peace with God. As you lean on God, He will be strong where you are weak. Praise God.
he did something stupid, he assumes, apologizes. there is no death of man. his gesture is regrettable but despite his status as a big star he recognizes his mistake, a great man, a great actor, to err is human  il a fait une connerie, il assume, s'excuse. il n'y a pas mort d'homme. son geste est regrettable mais malgré son statut de grande star il reconnait son erreur, un grand monsieur, un grand acteur, l'erreur est humaine
We will always love you
We all have our bad moments. Will seems sick over the situation.  Praying that all parties can forgive.  When a person doesn't forgive the one that hurt them, you block their blessings and yours. Forgive and love one another.  Still love Will❤🙏
I ain't surprised Chris isn't interested in an apology.

YouTuber apologize be like:
I'm sorry but you have a screw loose 🤔 your behaviour was technically criminal not just unacceptable unless you are crazy. No normal person would do what you did. Honestly, don't even open your mouth. I'm never going to watch a film with you again.

IT'S SMITHIN TIME
Zzzzzzzz, you are not the guy you were. Just go away.
Will Smith you are human just like the rest of us. As long as God has forgiven you and you forgave yourself, keep living and don't beat yourself up. Most of your critics have done much worse and because of pride they don't have the mindset to do better and apologize for the wrongs they've done. We all do things without thinking, acting out of character or anger and stress but as long as you know and realize where you were wrong and admit your wrongs, it's okay.... Be human. The media has a way of hyping things up to cause drama. I can relate and if I had the opportunity to reach out to the individual and apologize to them personally, I would but I don't have access to them. So I keep living in hopes that maybe one day he'll see through my heartfelt apology. Be blessed, God is using this as an example for you to help someone else through their mistakes.
Shoutout to his family
wack beta energy...
Ánimo Will 💟
Nope!
"I am sorry" *video ends* It would have been better than this video.
Yes but also I am here to promote my son's WATER product.
Wow only took 4 months to Apologize??
That's nice. Actions speak louder than words though.
I was hoping for a comic edit. I can't stand to watch the "real" version. 🥵
One thing about a actor they gone act
“Admitting to a mistake means refusing to use other people as scape-goats to avoid responsibility but rather courageously owning up to every single one of them.”  ~T. Whitmore  🏆 *WILL SMITH IS STILL GREAT* 🏆
To everyone else:  “I’m sorry to the academy”  “I’m sorry to Chris’ family”  To Chris:  “I… “apologize” to you…”  People really don’t understand how valuable a simple I’m sorry can be. Will refusing to say those words to Chris just shows he cares more about his ego and it’s not a genuine apology
"Disappointing people is my central trauma" - wtf does this actually mean??
Get divorced lol
Too little…. too late….! We’ll miss the man we all grew to cheer for.
Will you should come make a guillotine vs video with me ! :)
Will, why would you do that to another brother? You guys should all be supporting each other in this world.
That's great. Is never late to apologize
THIS IS A SERIOUS APOLOGY. You can tell...  he took a WHOLE 5 MINUTES before going to play Golf.
This if anything just proved Will is a great actor
So ya screwed up. We all screw up. We all respond impulsively. We have all lost our cool and regret what we did. The biggest difference is most people do that in the privacy of their vehicle, or at home. You're in the public spotlight so it happened there. Funny how we are all great lawyers when we screw up but great judges when somebody else does. Much love Will.

I used to do this all the time, say sorry and just assume I'm good now.  Nah.
Sowwy ;(- Will Smith
Maybe Chris should apologise to you as you were so full of yourself during the acceptance speech!!! And so funny and cool partying after the ceremony. Impossible not to notice you were devastated for your behaviour.
Nearly 5 months later, this is what we get?
Well, better late than never (I suppose . . .🤔), but late nonetheless. Elvis has left the building, and the train departed Grand Central  four months ago, Mr. Smith.🤨😐😑🤨
Did he fr wear his own merch?
He can't even give a proper unreserved apology. Retire in shame.
2:51 brah u about to laugh or cry though?
I love me some Will smith . Appreciate the effort you put into your apology and yourself as a human being . Keep ur head up 👏🏾👍🏾

So I saw them talking about you on Fox News the other day. What happened was wrong, but I know why you did it and I don’t completely blame you. You apologized and that’s great, but I hate hearing that this hurt so many people. I disagree with that. You can and will move past this. You’re good people Will. Get your mind right and everything else will get right.
If he is sincere and not acting then bravo to him for accepting accountability
west philly bby junkyard gang freshprince all day. fresh should done fresh prince and jazzy jeff movies  in the 90s u could still do them just with young actors and u and jeff do cameios like the fresh prine goes to bel air and philliy pool party cant wait for legend 2 n 3 better be in then freshprince or aint watchin them,.hey hey hey is freshprince in the hood platinum
It's a shame the apology video didn't start off with, “Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down...”

Will studied for months before auditioning for the role of a man that regrets his lack of moral compass. Unfortunately the audition was not convincing. Go play golf with all the other rich people no one likes.
Will still justifying his actions by getting in a dig about Chris disrespecting him. Just ask for forgiveness and move on..
You let me down
Humano! Forças, Will! Estamos com você.
Way too involved in social media my dude. Disconnect and stop caring what others think.
I just came here to leave a comment. I have no intention of watching this BS. I actually used to like him as an actor but as a person that's another story. I know I'll never support another one of his movies no matter how good it is. It's the principle. That's my opinion and as of today I still have a right to it , however, there's always tomorrow to look forward to.
When an award winning actor gives an apology it will always be difficult to distinguish between sincere words and words read from a script

Nonsense. I've done this, I've done that... It is still all about Will Smith.

Apology accepted!!! It's ok move on now with your head up...no one is perfect. Ask for forgiveness and move on knowing with your whole heart you meant it. Be better in the future....
Take your hundreds of millions and disappear now.
Ok so i think i figured out what CLM means, it stands for "China Like Mars" which is a new American nationalist movement that advocates for nuking China untill it resembles Mars, it was started earlier this year by America first nationalist and twitch streamer Matt Rinaudo and has gained up to 50K members in the last 7 months Also most of it's members call themselves "OTK frogs" (frog here is their way of saying the F slur while avoiding ban, YIKES) However I still  have no idea why they're using this video in particular to spread their disgusting message
I’m not watching this lol
Will smith: 1 minute = 4 months
I wish youtube would bring back the dislike button so we can laugh at his horrible apology
* sigh * OH HERE WE GO AGAIN
You should read the book kingdom man by Tony Evan's will change your life. Trust me
I’m not buying it. Nothing more than a SELF-serving apology. You should feel ashamed of yourself for what you did !
WHAT WAS THE REAL REASON ??? IM SO DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY AT A BLACK MAN THAT WAS MY IDEAL MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD!!! MY SON AND I WATCHED YOU DO THAT AND HE ASKED ME WHY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER I DIDNT HAVE AN ANSWER !!!! AND IT CRUSHED ME AS A FATHER !!! I DIDNT HAVE A MAN IN MY LIFE AS A KID SO I WATCH YOU AND TRIED TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD . I CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER CAUSE OF YOU WENT INTO THE MILITARY CAUSE I DIDNT HAVE AN UNCLE PHIL IN MY LIFE !!! PEOPLE EVEN SAID I LOOK LIKE THE BROKE VERSION OF YOU GROWING UP THAT DIDNT HURT CAUSE IN MY MIND I FELT LIKE I DAY I AM GOING TO BE A RICH POSITIVE BLACK MAN LIKE YOU . AND ILL GOING TO TEACH MY KIDS THINGS THAT I LEARNED FROM YOU GROWING UP !!! I HAVENT GOT RICH YET BUT I AM A POSITIVE BLACK MAN WHO HAS CAME A LONG WAY FROM HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT I WOULD TURN OUT !!! BASED ON MY CHILDHOOD  I SHOULDNT BE WHERE I AM TODAY  !!! BUT I AM SO SITTING WITH MY SON WATCHING YOU DO THAT HURT MORE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW !!!! SMDH
The memes were great though 😂
New meme template thanks Will.
Get well soon man. Take some time, sort out what you need to, and get back to what you’re good at when you’re ready. I can’t wait to see you on the big screen again.
This shows that he is still a person to look up to. Thank you for showing how we can be emotionally intelligent and grow ourselves after mistakes. Thank you for being real!
Te Amo Will!!!! Eres un extraordinario Ser Humano ❤️
Why Will why?
َ
if i was will smith i would have apologized with a stick
After months of rehearsal, Will Smith's 2nd fake apology comes across as much more refined.
Glad to see you are owning up to your mistakes Will
It's hard to watch this because I can't discern if the actor is making an apology as an actor or if a regular person is trying to make amends hoping someone will see the person instead of the industry that built him and his family. I wish I could say I forgive or don't forgive, but it isn't my forgiveness to be given. I enjoy the entertainment timing, physique, and an expressional face can give when telling a story. I'm just here for the entertainment and they know it because they have my money. Best of luck in life moving forward.

Will Smith wants to be a YouTuber so bad.
I’ve always been a fan of him and his work, but it’s a hard thing to get past ,what he did, I started watching this and only got about 15 seconds in,I don’t want to see him or hear his voice. I don’t know why because in his world I’m completely irrelevant,never thought what he did would bother me that much,but I’m so taken back by it I can’t even look at him
164k dislikes yikers
He ALMOST did a 10/10 classic YouTube apology video.  1) Multiple cameras (check) 2) the “sigh” (check) 3) a pet (not checked)
You are lucky that he didn't take you to court.... But he should have done
Ok Will, you can stop now
wack apology
He went full scientology lol
Bruh took 3 months to apologise 😅
LOVE your book brother. Thank you
Will Smith you da man!!!!

Man, you humiliated a grown man in front of millions. Your reaction was terrible. You should not be forgiven for that. But that's for Chris to decide.
#BoycottWillSmith
This was painful to watch. Kind of cringy because it doesn’t seem like Will’s genuinely organic personality. I do think that his apology is sincere but the way it was expressed just doesn’t seem like “Will” per se. I appreciate him making the effort. It just sucks that EVERYTHING is done so publicly; from the actual event occurring on national television where millions of viewers witnessed it to the measure of a YouTube video being utilized to make amends. Because it’s so public it honestly makes it hard to fathom the sincerity in it. I hope that both Chris & Will are able to get away from that moment❤️
🤮
GO LIVE A PRIVATE LIFE SO WE CAN STOP HEARING FROM AND SEEING YOU, ENOUGH ALREADY. Stop making US relive that horrible moment in history by having to read about you, see you and any of your old, new or upcoming projects. You’ve had enough limelight, take it and please retire from the public eye. Again, having to relive that utter disappointment of a moment by seeing your name is a trigger. Please, enough is enough already.
Cuck Smith/Suge Smith
Total BS.
Lenguaje no verbal dice, que eres agresivo, que esto lo hizo a fuerzas, y que miente . Osea falsedad pura Will Smith, necesita terapia psicológica y la esposa es de igual manera agresiva . Mi opinión y según el doctor en psicología Adrián salama
Love you Will. We all make mistakes. Continue to grow and all we can do is hope to get the closest we can to our best selves.
"why didn't you apologize to  chris in your acceptance speech?" , well ... for me that's the whole point of the video , he didn't because in that moment , he didn't knew that act was canceling he out on the internet , as he does now... the "apologize video" youtuber style , in my opinion comes more as a damage control , career wise , not a sincere regret;        But hey , plants on the back , white shirt , rebirth right? new man
Can we get a dislike update?
It'll take time, but eventually an honest apology has to be accepted, so people can really move forward.
Why do celebrities love the word moment? They aren't even using the word correctly.
Bruhh...you literally took a poop on stage for everyone to look at, and ffs walked away proud like if you were properly potty trained.
We all make mistakes. Will’s mistakes just get broadcast for the world to see and get remixed into memes! “He” that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone. 🙌🏾❤️
This is what happens when you stray from the path alone single he he is a good man but his influence around him which he has created himself has up ended everything he loves and believes in he needs to take control of his own life and quit letting his life control him Aside from the fact that he thinks everyone who disagrees with you should be deported you used to be a good man Mr. Smith I am disappointed
Still sending love and blessings. Still a fan of you and what you really stand for.

I forgive you Will. Even though what you did to chris was wrong, we all make mistakes in life.🙏
nah nigga its been months
he has not been sighed to a movie since then so i wonder why he is apologizing
You are such an outstanding actor and King William was such an incredible movie, fantastic!!!! It's just sad that this happened and seemed out of your character. We ALL make mistakes, I hope you can get your life back on track and continue to make movies.

WHY THE HELL DO YOU NEED SO MANY CAMERAS TO SAY SORRY, SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD ALREADY DONE, im seeing this is done just like trevor jacobs crashing his plane with 5 cameras filming him
Well, he did apologize. It's can be hard to face yourself, and this guy has been in the public eye in culture of film etc, so...so long as he means it. Perhaps we will see will, and chris shake hands, and hug or something eventually, and if we don't...we can't blame chris for avoiding him in person. Something about burning a bridge.
Tbh, i dont see the apologise in this act at all
You should quit acting Will You lost respect!
Scripted Apology you have a platform could just went live an did this
who let him post this omg so fake
Bully
Like training for a boxing match but being an actor training for the role of your life. Everyone has inner turmoil. I still love Will Smith. I think everyone is a little messed up right now…
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽May Allah grant you ease and peace. Ignore all them. you will be fine. . . .
In a nutshell: "I'm not really remorseful, I'd just like to be employable again".
its over bro just embrace it.
this was as awkward as the Michael Richard's apology
Great John Malkovich impression.
He will never be Happy and normal" before getting divorced.
I forgive you Will. You screwed up, we have all done things we regret. The only thing I would add to Chris is for you to ask him to forgive you as well. Asking forgiveness is a true sign of remorse and humility. Sending you a big hug. ❤️

Wish YouTube brought back dislike button
The thing is nobody can truly know another person. Everyone has different experiences and perspectives. We can express ourselves in the best way possible but other people only understand through their own experiences. So it doesn’t matter if you made a mistake or genuinely feel sorry for your actions. Nobody will truly understand your experiences in life that lead up to the choice you made and they won’t truly understand how you feel afterwards. No matter how you apologize or what you say, nobody can read your mind and feel what you feel. There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake. There’s nothing wrong with apologizing. What other people think doesn’t mean a thing. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. You’re just being authentically yourself <3

The actual act was just out of order, but is what concerns me the most is Jaden Smith then saying on social media "thats how we do it" about what Will did, that shows it maybe was not just a in the moment thing and this is how their family behave, Jaden clearly needs to be shown that isnt the way to go about things.
You never had to apologize, lol.
nice editing on those 3 camera angles.. Time  for "Youtube Rweind" Now I know why the dislike button was removed by Youtube
1:00 His hand was shaking, this felt sincere.....
will L moment
Guys. Stop acting like you perfect. Forgive the man n let's all move on. Geeez
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🟥
you can tell he in a toxic relationship just like Depp… hope he gets out soon 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Apology! Excepted Mr. Smith. ✌🏽❤
i mean why did he so overly produce it..just take your damn food and be candid not this cool lighting expensive camera and lighting crap. why you need all of that to apologize?
when this vid was first posted it was 90% likes, now a day later it's more like 35%, proof that youtube skews the "likes"
Smith,tell Chris to keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile.
Thing is, there’s a lot of comments here saying “we forgive you will” but to be honest it isn’t for us to forgive him. It’s up to Chris. He can only make that call. 100%!
Will you’re still the truth everyone in these comments is a lame keep doing you forever
Repent TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU REPENT
Repent TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU REPENT
Repent TO GOD LORD JESUS CHRIST GOD LOVES YOU REPENT
Bruh! It's too late. Forget it. Damage was done. You cannot return or fix anything.
3 months later!!! , very  hard to believe this apology is sincere seems to be more about the impact on will smiths career and pocket   I really love Will but the repair doesn't match the damage to Chris
Once I heard the big sigh at the beginning. I knew this WILL be one of the youtubiest apologies of all time🤗 nothing like being sincere when checking off the youtuber apology checklist
He didnt realize that his hand would meet Chris Rocks Face.... Rest in Peace, Fresh Prince... Now we got this Will Smith.
BRUH, he putted a bottle of his own enterprise in the table, wtf
I don't think this is getting the response he hoped for lol.
💀
Totally robotic, devoid of any real human emotions. Scary.
Good Job Will!!!  I believe you, noone has to believe your apology if it was sincere well done.. if not God is the judge and he will handle it..  Regardless of how you apologize people will never be satisfied. Mistakes happen yours  just happened to be in the public eye. Keep pushing I will still continue to support you.
Fake man  Fake life  Fake apology
John 6:8 I guess the ones judging are perfect and never did nothing wrong and no mistakes at all....
Will I believe you.
It’s amazing how there are so many negative comments from you people, as if you’re perfect. None of you all make mistakes right? You should really do some self reflection before you try and judge someone
Y'all haters acting like you never overreacted or made a fool of yourself, never fucked up. This is ridiculous. He messed up. He overreacted. He behaved in a shitty way that was really out of character, it was shocking etc but it pales in comparison to all the awesomeness he's brought to our world. Cut the guy some slack.
This would be one of most disliked videos on internet
Why he look like Venice & Serena daddy
When you use three different cameras to issue an apology, I'm reminded of something the judge in the movie Mrs Doubtfire said... "your little speech seemed to be... very heartfelt and genuine. But I believe it to be a terrific performance by a very gifted actor. Nothing more".
Nah.
So Brave
That’s the most insincere, heartless, and rehearsed bullish!t apology I’ve ever heard. You should be embarrassed you even thought of apologising in such a manner. Heck, I’m embarrassed for you.
I’m glad you posted this. You are a fine actor, and I’ve always enjoyed your work. I was horrified by what you did to Chris.  Forgiveness is a powerful thing. I hope Chris and his family and friends will forgive you. We are all flawed people and make mistakes. Yours happened to be on an international  stage and hurt someone else.   Finally, you have to  forgive yourself and move forward. Find a project and get to work. I wish you the best.  And don’t listen to the haters.  They have to find their own path to peace and understanding.
The night was ruined. Ruined for everyone.  Unfortunately,  this skillfully produced apology, will not change that fact. Stay quiet,  take your lumps and wait it out.  Only time can heal these wounds.
posts formal 4 mos late apoloqy while shamelessly plugging his book directly under  the post
It's just classic that so many people here in the comments are so hateful and have no understanding, like they're walking on some kind of gold path with no mistakes. Classic self righteous narcissistic behavior. I want everyone here pointing fingers to imagine taking the greatest indiscretion of your life and airing it on public television for the world to see. How would you feel? Humiliation is only the beginning. Y'all need to back off and let the man atone for his mistakes and remember that forgiveness is the only way forward.
It’s been 4 months and you’re now apologizing? SMH
He even made sure the video was uploaded in 4k so we can all see in high detail how good his acti..... apology is
I don’t like what he at all but the judgement from all you perfect people going to heaven is priceless. Good thing none of you are God. If He forgives who are y’all not to.
☻️🤚😡
ummm  no thank you
You did what you did, it was a wrong move, you apologized sincerely. Now get up and shine don't bet up on yourself too much. Guidance and love to you both.
Why every single apology video on YouTube has a title like a quote or something ? Does that make it more acceptable or something
Will Bro !! I just trust you and your body of work . You at high position and every mistake is also high level . We are still friends and will always be !! 😉
I hope God helps you to be able to forgive yourself and put it behind you.   You are an inspiration to me and many others. Keep going 💪🏾
That was a good lie. I mean, apology video. Dude heavy research on how to apologize. He did not answer the question  #Cringe
I only accept apologies in cash so if you want my forgiveness for this Will Smith you’ll need to pay up.
Bit late
*Jeez, he's such a bad actor.*
3:33 Tarnished ... 💀
Will, I will continue to love you and your work, even with your mistakes.
Can't wait for the edits and YTPs 💀
People love to use the “I’m human” as a scapegoat for their shitty behaviors.
Can't wait for the parodies of this
He doesn't come across as sincere at all.
Mid Apology way Late lol
Shut up, Will. Stay gone
You're a good man Will, people make mistakes, that's just human nature. I hope you and Chris can resolve this. Sending love from the UK.
“Thanx y’all”
And that is what a man or woman should do when they have deeply offended the world.  Keep with the work of good, Will Smith.  Keep with the work of good.  Thank you.
Crazy how many famous people out there who are jerks/ aholes and DON'T apologize and their fans STILL follow them and look up to them. Like wow. Just wow and insane. But when there are ones that they apologize we have people not wanting to accept their apology. No one is perfect. No one. We all make mistakes. I have accepted everyone's apology who have said sorry to me. If it was sincere, great. If it wasn't it wasn't but I accepted it. But I'm sure there is people who have done wrong and don't admit it and won't apologize. Their freakin ego and thats just not right. I'm glad he apologized. I'm not going to criticize someone or put someone down. He apologized, he's a human being who is owning up to what he did. We are not perfect. John 8:7
This is too late and doesn't come off as authentic.  Some things there is no coming back from.
As someone who's been listening to you since you were 17, it was very disappointing when it happened, but thanks for this. People make mistakes
<3
Will you did what you did it's done. Now get rid of that horrid woman. Trust me you will truly find happiness once she has gone.
The Reason Behind Removing Dislike
If there was no such thing as redemption, or second chances, we'd all be unable to be renewed. I'll just leave it at that.
162k downvotes so far Will. We ain't buying it.
Freaking SNL produced this because the look of the video reminds me greatly of SNL skits.
The best way to deal with a narcissist... ignore them.  Drives them bonkers.  They can't handle when people don't except their bs apology.  Chris knows exactly what he's doing.
He wasn’t angry at Chris, misdirected anger. He needs to look around and identify what is causing him this pain.
youve been one of my favorite entertainers and you did not let me down. the decision was questionable but i understand the reaction.
For those of you who can't see the dislikes it above 162K+++
Who is this for exactly, Chris? His family? The fans? All of which Will Smith has already apologized to extensively. The way I see it this apology with it's good lighting and different camera angles is for Hollywood. His phone has stopped ringing and it's freaking him out. Nobody wants to work with him after that and i don't blame them. We all make mistakes but the disrespect showed in that moment to the whole entertainment industry was shocking. He bit the hand that fed.
Will=SSSIIIIMMMMPPPPP
Will, I forgive you
i see so much ha_te coming at Will, "oh there's three cameras", "oh product placement" blah blah blah, i think people honestly forget that he is just another person living in this world and that inside he is the same as everyone else.
💀he still didnt talk to him in 4 months but posts on youtube apologizing but cant to his face.
Product placement of jadens water / 3 camera studio set up / 4 months to write the script and learn his lines. Well done deserves another award. What a big rich child
CLM ✊🍋
Nah Will, literally feels so forced and not authentic.... sorry but not sorry 😐
0:01 APOLOGY STARTS
4 months of YouTube apology training still not enough. Would love to see that dislike button number
I love you will ❤️😍
Great guy, good thing he's apologetic.
I want to believe this to be a genuine effort to make amends but it seems too staged and perfect.  The water bottle is perfectly placed with its logo facing the camera. The mic placed in front of him is not wired. I'm no sound technician so it could simply be wireless. The background is perfect. More like a studio setup. The intro is very documentary-like.   I want to believe the best in situations but everything just screams with a lack in authenticity and realism. Not trying to troll. Just the details make it seem more staged/damage control than a real apology. What does everyone think?
this seems like a post-credit scene
You were just doing what your wife's boyfriend would have wanted you to do. #CLM
"Uil", sua desculpa não melhora em nada a cretinice da tua atitude, pelo contrário, apenas demonstra tua hipocrisia. Eu jamais tornarei a assistir qualquer obra tua, nova ou antiga.
Too soon, yet too late.

you shouldn't apologize to that buffoon!!! what you did was right. I would've done worse
people need to understand we not all perfect just like how people can be disappointed that’s not there business at , don’t punish your self a lot will smith
You are human and I love and appreciate the light in you. Continue to shine bright Sir. No one is perfect. That anyone is held to a perfect standard of expectation,is preposterous. Also, other peoples opinions of you, are none of your business. Live your best life! F the rest.
"Apologizes" while wearing a hat with a W on it.... How can that possibly not be a protect career and image video ?
I just want Will happy again
Why is he talking like that is it just me or he’s talking real slow😭
If only he wasn’t speaking like he’s a robot
I don’t believe he is genuine. It looks rehearsed act.
You'r still my favorite actor......
"It's been a minute"  *Its 4 months but...... Okay?*
Will Smith 💓 I speak Romans 8:28 over you, your family, your relationships and your career in Jesus'Mighty name. Amen. #Jesusalwayswins #thebestisyettocome
It is brave. All my sincere empathy to you dear Will. Stay hard ! 👊🏽
Look how slow fake and rehearsed this is lol. He has no real emotions. A total narcissist.
We still love you! Let’s forgive and forget and get back to Love and Entertainment!!!!!
Will never buy or go see another Will Smith anything.
Regular degular people do far worst. From road rage, fighting in public spaces like stores, bars, little league games, etc.   People put public figures on a pedestal like they can't do no wrong. I've definitely last my temper in a "professional" setting a few times. Some people just like pushing your buttons. Being the bigger person only goes so far 🙃
Who put him in front of that glove thing? Makes his head look weird.
Feeling fuzzy? That's the best excuse you could come up with after 4 months? You think we are stupid? You didn't apologise because you were still angry. Just admit it don't lie. Such a fake rehearsed 'apology'

0:30   Ya its rewind time
I'm so sick of celebrities
A Water commercial. JFC
This is just for PR, he probably has a project coming out soon and was advised to do this.
this was in a studio and sponsored by jaydens water company lmao
Cringe
WAIT WHAT AN ACTUALLY GOOD APOLOGY VIDEO?
Selling a book in the description really doesn't look good...
He's not sorry to Chris, he's not sorry to Chris's family either. Notice how he doesn't say "sorry" towards them but says "apologize" which is the action word and not sincerity, he says "I apologize to Chris" that means he feels like he doesn't need to apologize sincerely to him. But changed it to "I'm sorry" whilst addressing his family that means more to him. This is just him acting, and trying to repair his reputation that has taken a nose dive equivalent to Amber Herd.
After seeing this i still admit Will really a damn good actor
Will that was the best thing u could have done is explain ur self . 👏🏼☺️
I'm pretty sure will has Chris's phone number, this video is just to stroke his ego
This is what the Rewind button should've been used for
my favorite part of this performance is when he pretends that he didn’t read and vet those questions before the video. Legit acting like he’s reading them for the first time hahahaha
This is not an apology, this is a publicity stunt. you did not even reach out to chris
No matter what I still with you
Did you get Steven Spielberg to help with this? Looks like a great cinematic. Also the water on the right.. isn't that Jayden's water product? Wow nice apology video bruh but even better advertising LOL
Cuk
We have all fallen short of perfection, let those of you who haven't messed up throw the first stone.  He messed up, he owned it and apologized.  Let's show some grace.
I lost all respect for you bro. Apologies are good and all, but you can never get that respect back.
How about no?
I didnt even listen to his apology, i just hung out in the comments hahahaha
He was doing so well until he came out with "deeply remorseful without being ashamed of myself" crap. Keep working and come back in a few more months. Best of luck Will.
No will you were straight up embarrassed no one feels bad for you why do you keep apologizing online
It's been a minute.... No. It's actually been months....
Honestly dude, I think Will is probably a good guy who just made a really bad mistake. I think his whole life up to this point has showed that.
96k likes. 161k dislikes. Makes sense.
spectacular way to end one's career. Well done!
You out human how can you let us down and you let us see you as a human that has issues like the rest of us an not this high powered god like man you are more in God's presence when you go radical God was radical we have to stop thinking we are not flawed human with no matter what we have in life
People make mistakes. I still believe you are a good person Will, flaws and all. You try to do better and right your wrongs, that's what matters the most! I hope you find peace with yourself and with Chris.
Forgive yourself and move forward
We love you will great man no matter what I love you for what you did for this culture they can never stop you Will Smith ☺️
Will there is no going back.
Will Smith...  You're a disappoint now.  It's time for you to just disappear into the crowd and go away.
His main trauma is not that he hurt another human being  It's that his image is tarnished 😂
...understanding the nuances and complexities of what happened...  This is a stage performance   The fake sigh to begin with The fake set with that purposely placed LOVE IS THE CURE The product placement of his sons drink  The many different camera angles
Chris was on bad
What does Jada's boyfriend think about this though?
It’s rewind time
His fresh prince character was more believable than that was stone em
Nobody’s perfect. Hilarious how judgmental people can be like they never made a mistake in their life, no matter how big or small in comparison. IMO
Its been a minute?  no!! Its been 4 months.
Life is too short to hold grudges and be mad. People make mistakes and he apologized for it. Whether it was genuine or he was forced to make this video (Which was probably more likely) I hope he learns from this debacle.
I’m praying for you Mr. Smith, I know this is hurting your Heart, just try not to stay in this place of Regret too much longer. As unfortunate as that moment WAS, there is a Lesson. Don’t allow the media to keep pulling you back to it. Maybe a Mother to Mother talk is what’s needed here, that might start the healing between you two Great Black Men. Please take care.
MR. SMTH. I can only wish you GOD'S grace/mercy. As I stated once before, you/Chris were friends.. things may not be the same, but at least be cordial with one another. And yes, it's Chris' call if he forgives. I wish you both the best!
Can’t believe Will was able to nearly perfectly pull off the YouTuber apology video after only 4 months of training.
Why he look like hes holding back a smile though 😂
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
just got back to music you were really good at that.
🤡
Will after the video : "That should do"
Sir you really think  🤔 I'm confused...
It's been a minute? its been 4 months my guy
Wow…. He’s lowered himself back to the “ fresh prince days “ after he became Tom cruises status
Why don’t you sigh like someone is forcing you to do it and then not edit it out?  Oh you did that?  Good
Man, Youtube rewind really went off track this year.
Will Smith d...
Nope. He done. Enjoy retirement as a public figure. Will Smith's career as an actor ended that night. You just don't come back from that. I guess good thing he has nearly 10m youtube subs but good luck making  new content to engage them at this stage.
"O Ow... Richard"
Your video Will... it's shmackin' dude!
leave that woman.
🤬
Neuralyzer would be useful right about now
"When you hurt my child you hurt me" brutal
🍋✊ CLM
whack
👏👏👏
I just witnessed another glorious birth of a meme
Bro sounds more robot than mark zuckerburg
Will, you’re a human being who did a human thing, and in no way does this excuse your actions. I get it and your not perfect and we have move on and forgive you in time. You have done so much good for our culture and this just goes to show one action can in these days can tarnish your whole good reputation. I love you Will and always will. So keep your head up and we will get through this 🙏🏽
Wills apology was smoother than Jadas bald head.
I absolutely hate that introductory soundbite of a shuddery exhale from Will. How manipulative.
FAKE apol
It's a lose-lose for Will at this point, but im glad he chose this instead.
He who is without sin, cast the 1st stone.
Will why???your fail in this moment ,your decision was good before and too many people were with you, you were strong now you are weak and stupid, remenber silence is gold
God damn that was bad.  So forced almost like he was fighting himself not to apologize lol
Lol. What a plonker!!
The comments are so different on Instagram  than on here
Will you are a great man. Don't let your haters take you down because one little mistake. We love you.
It's okay Will. #CLM ✊
Bro made a YouTuber apology video bruh 💀💀💀
Only when you whip yourself screaming "shame on me!" - then I will feel convinced.
Can’t believe Will was able to nearly perfectly pull off the YouTuber apology video after only 4 months of training.
Wonder who the revenue is going to for the video?
Let's really say that I apologize because my reputation in Hollywood has been tainted and I am not as popular as I once was... it is affecting my pocketbook.
Dude, take your hat off. What a weird, forced interview.
Y’all making such weird comments at least this apology was better than Travis Scott’s
It's over bruh
WTF is CLM???????
Will you are not sincere. You were foggy? You lost your mind go see a professional counseling.  You destroyed your image forever.
He should have used his skills from Men in Black and busted out the neuralyzer to erase anyones memory who watched this video…
A Delusion to think that the bullying and poor anger management behaviours were exceptional and driven by a one off event.
i like the beard
Thank you
This video has 159K dislikes as of 31/7/22
Will Smith isn't lying.
Haven’t done anything good since Six Degrees, go away plz.
What is CLM???
We stand with you genie/will smith we got your back covered your even the best actor in the world just like johnny depp
2:47 cap
🤣🤡
it’s so funny watching you be sad, i love it
When you use three different cameras to issue an apology, I'm reminded of something the judge in the movie Mrs Doubtfire said... "your little speech seemed to be... very heartfelt and genuine. But I believe it to be a terrific performance by a very gifted actor. Nothing more".
i personally will stop admiring you... eventhough you apologize...
Lol
We forgive you ❤️❤️❤️
I will always love me some Will Smith. We are from the same Star System!🌌😊👽🤘🏽Living Legend as you are and one of the greatest beings to ever grace the Cosmos. You can do no wrong in my eyes. Whether that moment was a staged ritual or a genuine reaction based off of pure principal, Lord knows it's not easy dealing with us here on the Earth plane. The majority don't know the half of what you have to go through in order to share your art, gift and heart in this dark world. So thank you for sharing your light. Thank you for being human, transparent and vulnerable enough with us to apologize. Thank you for reminding us that it's okay to make mistakes and to do the necessary work to make it right whether they accept it or not. You are the definition of courage and strength because it takes bravery to live your life out loud for the entire world to judge. I salute you! Thank you for bearing your soul with us. Love you brother! 😇🤙🏽💙👑🛸💫
willbur smithelcuck apology - Rated 3/10  "still the best screenplay he worked with since men in black 1"
An apology but not explanation. He has made this apology all about himself.
Give the man a break, we all make mistakes.
Im losing faith in humanity reading these comments lol
*hes a good actor*
Diesen Kanal nicht empfehlen
What does this CLM stand for? Chinese Lives Matter?!
4 months bro
Ok but wtf is CLM?
Money for him is above all and not an apology ... Nobody wants to deal with him
It's hard to feel anything from Will's tears after the "how come he don't want me, man" scene from fresh prince
Can youtube ban these chanell?
Lol
1:30 IT WAS PAINFUL
I wouldn't say you let anybody down ... I think everybody was more in shock because we have never seen this said of you . Yes we all make mistake  but you can't beat you self up over it . If I was in your shoes I would be at Chris's house everyday until I was able to talk to him not a phone text or email a verbal one on one conversation with no camera's telling him how sorry you really are .( Alot of people know kinda the stuff you been dealing with over the past couple years and that would mess with alot of people mentally. ) If he doesn't accept your apology you can't blame him but he's a good person to and I think he would understand..  Keep your head up so you and Chris can move past this .. stay blessed
Will I know you did what u did and you are sorry and I can tell you mean it bc punctuation you are using to express your feelings and I really that everyone can move on
too lil' too late, chief. 🤣🇵🇭
i kinda just feel bad for him
I don't think Chris will have a genuine discussion wit Will for along time 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
Logan Paul would be watching this rn
Bro come on it was funny
I think we all know who is the real Problem
unsub gang
One of the videos where you know the likes to dislikes ratio is crazy 😂
Have been a fan of yours for a long time. You're a generational staple brother; praying for your peace & healing - cleaning house is difficult, but necessary, however close 😐✌🏾🙏🏾
bro its been 5 months who cares
❤️❤️❤️
You just Jake Paul'd your entire career and just chose the same way out by saying sorry, should have thought of that before making your WWF move at the Grammies granny.
eating popcorn and drinking mountain dew to this. Really funny vid tho 😊
It's funny how Charlie's video roasting will Smith's apology has more views them will Smith's actual apology, which btw has been ratio'd and has 180k dislikes in a day lol
CLM WE STAND WITH YOU KING ✊🍋
Is this a QnA?💀😂
I thought I saw yu jump on a livestream cipher a little while after. No hard feelings. Where's the music?
170k dislikes btw for anyone who wants to know the real ratio since yt doesn't want u to see it lol
It's okay Will, We forgive you.
he just now dose it 💀
"The World is Sick. Love is the Cure" That frame at the back is making me think that they're trying to psychologically manipulate me into thinking that the world is the problem and not Jada's nor Will's fault that this happened. 🤣
The comment section be like full of judgemental 15 year olds... Or what? I really thought we have progressed as people and societies but reading here or under the Depp/Heard case makes me wonder if we progressed anywhere since the middle ages. Pathetic.
CLM 🍋✊
✊🍋CLM
Уилл ты лучший а рок просто воспользовался случаем для славы
You apology is heard and we just have to learn from this terrible mistake and take it one day at a time
Will Smith will never live this down....
Lol
At least he didn't disable comments. Shows he is available and willing to take criticism for his actions as a punishment. You'll recover Will, just keep it real.
Is this an apology or a water ad?
Bruh just get out of that relationship. She's the one who should be apologizing for emotionally manipulating you to make you feel like you're not a man and that you have to do something like that to get her respect.
I am just waiting for Chris's answer
Admittedly he hasn't done himself any favours by leaving it this long to apologise but it's good that he has but whatever the case, now is a time for reflection, whatever the outcome!
that sigh though…
black
We all make mistakes, the one's that we hoped that we never made in the first place! But if and when we do make those mistakes then it's only appropriate to do the decent thing by apologising for those mistakes after one sorting their own head out!  Other than that, all one can do is wait, time is afterall the greatest healer!
Way too late WS, and what's with the entire setup with multiple camera angles. Disingenuous to the max and nothing but a fake PR attempt.
WTF does CLM mean?
From my perspective that was the right thing to do, if i were you I wouldn't apologize.
A Biden moment reading off that teleprompter 😂😂
love you dude stay strong , were only human and we all fall short of our expectations but if holywood can forgive oj then youll be sweet.
I'm surprised Dr. Evil let you off of your leash to say this...
Throwing words like they mean something. Will, you have issues, treat yourself.
You should really divorce that ignorance woman. You are Legend, you deserve better than her, than anything else. I didn’t mean you did right thing but I can feel as a man who wants to protect his precious woman. But not her man. You definitely know that in your deep mind.
The comment section acting like they never made a mistake
Too little too late.
He still keeps saying "it hurts me". It's not about you. Chris doesn't want to talk to you.
Not convince, you still sounds miserable..bring TRUE light, love and joy to yourself first. the rest will follow.
Its to be a human to make mistakes, and its to be a man to apologize and try to repair the demage.  You have my respect   dear sir.
Can someone explain this in clash royale terms
Bro if u really feel so bad...just take half of your whole assets and transfer to him. You talk too much!
I say this out of real love and concern for Will, you are not alright, like really, and I am not talking about what you did, which happens, go get some time alone travel somewhere, you can, i hear someone deeply in pain and like under a spell or something.. Please take care of yourself, we love you ♥️
Why is he talking so slow? How slow is that teleprompter?
everything in this video has been thought out and layed out in the shot, multiple cameras.. strategically placed books, the clothes, the furniture.. its sickening.  Will's performance (great actor..) I wonder how many takes it took.. since they are cutting between cameras it could even be done over several hours..
CLM!
Te ofendieron no tenías que pedir perdon Esto te hace más grande
🤡💀
I'm always rooting for you. Cheer up, Will! I recently read your book "WILL". I have been an old fan of yours since your movie "Bad guys". There are times when people make mistakes. However, I believe Will you are a good man, truly! Don't too worry.It's going to work out.^^❤️👍
i always find it telling when someone disassociates from their behavior even when they are trying to own it by saying things like 'when that happened'  or 'that it happened like that'  instead of 'when I did that' or 'when I chose to do that'.   And also when people say 'that isnt me' instead of something like 'this is who i grew as, who I am and it will always be a struggle to not be that person.'    Sort of like an alcoholic after a relapse saying 'i am not an alcoholic, and i am going to do better'.
You need to leave that women PERIOD ... SHE NOT FOR YOU BRO , SHE FOR THE STREETS .. you can do wayyyyy better . She got you BLIND
Will Smith is still better than Chris he's way more famous so ima back will anyday
What took you so long?
Proud of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
My dude is in his youtube apologist era
CLM  🍋 WILLY!
that woman is ruining you
Very robotic
I couldn’t stop laughing whilst watching this. The sigh at the start was perfect 😂
i belive in you Will!
It’s all good, Will, I forgive you. #CLM
Individual people will choose who they are friends with. Just because Will Smith makes an apology does not mean the people he hurt will want to have  a relationship with him. I saw the videos he made at the time he was writing his book. I saw how he treated the people he employed...I was not impressed with his attitude towards them.
The sigh, the robotic voice and the “my behavior was unexpectable” = YouTube apology
Will you were greatly respected by me throughout the years and that respect has become even greater. You are a wonderful person. God Bless you. If we the people who you are explaining your actions to live up to your qualities, we'd have a better country.
wtf is clm?
I’ll never watch any of his movies after that moment and I’m sure a lot of people are thinking the same. Its time to retire. 🫡
One bad moment shouldn't overpass a life time of good actions! For each finger we point to another person, we have tree pointing at us. We all make mistakes, but not everyone has the ability to recognize them. Keep up Will
Apology accepted by me. Im sure chris will coem round.
i appreciate you will.
Hurt people hurt others.
Here he comes, that’s Jada’s clown
🧢
Will Smith 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Thanx bye.
🍋 CLM ✊
Goofy ah
We Love you Will. We are all Humans and all did things that we regret. Hope Chris & You will be able to talk.
Not an apology
You know how the real problem is right, straighten her out or get rid of her.
who wrote u this speach ???? kevin hart ?
you misbehaved Infront of millions of people and your ego kept you from apologizing for all of these months .
He has made this about himself rather than his victim. Fws
GOAT!
I will simply repeat what I wrote when it happened: I hope that you are seeking out and getting the help that you need. Everyone is struggling right now - I hope that you are OK. Please take care of yourself.
too late.
You said all the rights things, your eyes betrayed you.
tf is clm ?
I am you
They even got the classic “Apology Sigh” in there at the beginning.
Take nothing personal brother. 💖✨
Just divorce then take some time off to heal and return.
Yeah…..this is not sincere at all 😖
What you have done is horrible. But your apology is how one should apologize. I hope you grow from this.
#CLM Keep up that grind king 👊🍋
I believe him in his apology. He has apologized. Though Chris is not ready to accept...Fine!  But Will has apologized and I'm good with it!
Good lord the dislikes are insane on this video. 95K👍 / 156K👎
Boooo Will Booooooo 👎👎
THE FRESH PRINCE👊🏾
That's a lot of damage+
Its smithin time
Good work man .I hope and pray for the best for you Will
Whatever happened has happened, now Will Smith Sir must move on and believe me, he has accepted his fault that’s the only thing needed rather than not accepting it. Great future ahead now be Happy and Enjoy the life ahead.
The only way you're going to make amends with Chris is if you offer him a major role in one of your upcoming movies.
I don’t get how this became such a big deal. And I thought I got in a lot of trouble for smacking my friend back in 4th grade.
Haven’t watched this yet, but it must be a great apology video, there’s 0 dislikes! I knew you weren’t a bad guy will!
WE LOVE U WILL!!! COME BACK!
Can’t wait to see Slapies Adventures.
The person you let down Will was yourself so forgive yourself and move on x🙏🏻x
Man literally took 2 whole minutes just to apologize for Chris lmao, that proves a point
Don't beat yourself up too much mate. There's not one person on the planet who can say they haven't done something they're not proud of. Look to the future. Peace dude 🙏
It takes a real man.... Big up the Fresh Prince! 💪🏾💯
Idk if everyone else can see the dislikes but for those of you who can't  95k likes - 156k dislikes
Man took 4 months to do some trained apology, yeah we *dont* accept it. Can say you literally stole the actions from every apology video ever lol. Forgot to bring you're dog big bro. Also, I understand what you're personal work was, it was, "lame boring lie training academy"   Info - Charles aka penguinz0
It's rewind time
CLM BABY
Brave thig to admit ones misdeeds and own up to them.  Good Job! sending you positive thoughts  and prayers for healing .
Proud of you, Will. You took accountability and apologised xx
Keep on going my king, you the best.we can't destroy decades of love you gave to us,to the world,just because of one night I love you
Hope both will make a video together
You know I’m not saying he wasn’t wrong, but no way would this be getting this kinda heat from people if they weren’t celebrities, particularly if they weren’t people of color. I don’t mean attention, I mean rage.  Will is not a monster in my books for this one slip up, and y’all still can’t let go of Pewdiepie, Shane Dawson, the list goes on, regardless of the endless number of things they did and said. So let’s stop pretending the YouTuber apology video doesn’t work and that the majority of you don’t just want to roll in this drama until people forget.
the youtuber apology
Whipped
It's not necessary to apologize to us but to Chris
Well rehearsed. Great production. Right camera angle. Lighting was great. Acting was on point.
Kia kaha Will. Be strong. We're hoping you and Chris can repair your relationship.
Bloody cuk. Who even cares.
D:
a broken man makes everything about him again.
We stand by you Will. You are strong for doing this and an inspiration to all of us. #CLM ✊🍋
Yeah this apology is better than the others I’ve seen lol especially the one with the ACTUAL death but yeah ok take your time bro your an epic actor you just need to refresh your mind
Love how he loves to remind people of his hard background, as he sit there crying.
use me as the dislike button
Seriously going to advertise your water brand in an apology video?? Why do you need to bring up that you felt disrespected and insulted? Just say sorry
I really liked Will but this just feels so staged managed. I’ll always watch his movies but I don’t believe a word he says any more. He’s a fake
He recited this script worse than he does in the movies. Try again Will!
Not sincere at all
You are still healing!  Sending you love and light! At the end of the day, everything has a reason! 💕 love you Will!
"I apologize.". Not I'm sorry, big distinction.
Hey...really enjoy your work.  Forget it God has.  Hanging on still a friend.  Next movies please!!
Really? Chris doesn't HAVE to be ready to your timeline or just because you took 3 months to apologise. and then twist it to your hurt, your feelings.. Man up say you were WRONG and whatever was behind it had NOTHING to do with Chris.
Damage control.
Welcome back, Will.
Typing from EU … 30 years ago I had two black people that were my child hood heroes. Mr Jordan and Mr Smith . There will be no recovery from this Mr Smith . What that woman did with you 🙁
Keep your apology videos, out of frikkin youtube!
She’s the reason your life isn’t good so cut her out
As a black woman I think Chris should forgive Will. Compassion is key here so lets support, discuss and personal development lol ah fuckit im kidding
bruh just divorce and be a happy man
Why was this in my feed?
Self-promotion and gaslighting at the end. Blah, blah, I am the emissary of love to the world and we'll be friends again (even though we never we're, are or could be), because I'm a celebrity who wants you to like me.   OK Love God. 🙄
This is what happens when society and the press makes a man feel like less than and he just snaps. I hope Chris can choose to talk to him even though he doesn’t have to.
The answer to what do you say to people who say that you let them down was, "It hurt me," not, "You were right. I did let you down." It's all about you.
Someone else just pointed out in  another video that he said he apologizes to the Rock's, but he says "I'm sorry" to his own family. That tells you right there that this apology wasn't authentic.
There's no part of you that made you do what you did. That is not a credible assertion.
Weird that we all get to sit here on our phones and says whatever we want and judge whatever we want but you have to stand up and be publicly dragged through the mud and still stand up
Ily will
Will this was good to see, you reacted and thats normal. You are a human being. You have given us so much joy over many years. You will still do that.
🍞
Man I use to be a big fan of will but since he became Jada's second lapdog cuz let's be honest he's not her first or her favorite lapdog but he's still her lapdog I've just lost all respect for him
New movie comin out huh?
Let it go dear Will.  Heal and move on.  You deserve to enjoy life.
Why you took 4 months to realise this, now you will start loosing something
You didnt tarnish anything.  You are very loved.
Love you so damn much Will.  You are a good man and person.
I can't be mad for long  at will Smith he was always there for us now he made a mistake and we should be here for him as well ❤️.
Classic YT heavy breathing at the beginning while trying to sound to sound like it's authentic by sounding like a robot. Also why advertise a water brand? Apologize with a chance of profit???..
Too damn late and too damn lame. Classic YouTube apology video.
Should have done this months ago everyone forgot about it
as a fan of Smith's work since Fresh Prince, I was shocked by his actions, especially seeing as he should know the nature of a comedian....but I  do understand, at times, one's emotions can overtake us and out common sense, and react in ways we normally wouldnt do. It does take a big man to recognize one's mistakes and apologize., and  also believe people do deserve a second chance., and least try to make amends. Should he waited this long, well, wouldnt been better to take that time to calm down, reflect and process, so not make issue worse,
Bruh
CLM! 🍋✊ YOU ARE STUNNING AND BRAVE
He needs an award for the most generic youtube apology
I’m witchu twin💯
I didn't feel that apologize not one bit. That's something he had to do.
Will, a couple things man... 1) I appreciate your attempt at an apology. 2) I need to know that you were one of the few people in Hollywood that I had respect for and now I have none 3) you need to make the statement that it's not okay to use your stature to beat up on the little guy... this is the example you set 4) it's fucked up that you didn't go to jail. it's fucked up that you weren't marched out of the building, you have privileges that I'll never have. 5) I'm no longer interested in your work moving forward. your actions affect every single person you choose to work with in the future.
Don't listen to the haters, we still believe in you Will!
Lol 3 months spent understanding the "nuances and complexities of the moment". I've spend less time studying for law school exams.
I was put off by the way he read the questions.............no sincerity in his voice.
94k likes and 155k dislikes wtf
Who is this guy?
The BEST human
Everything about this video was staged.  From the stereotypical sigh at the start, to the product placement and even the contradictory statements.  Disingenuous and just another PR stunt from the PR machine that is the Smith family.  No thanks.
You'd expect an adult man to act mature. But not Hollywood "stars"...smh
Ужас, ты же мужчина в конце концов) хватит ныть, правильно сделал, что лещанул этого черта за жену))
Really good "Just Water" commercial!
a great actor 😂
🙏🏾
Is he dressed to play golf after the apology?
Nice
Keep my wife’s name out chur f#%%ng MOUTH!!!
This dudes the man to me man! I adore the sentiment that he's trying to learn through to tool of remorse rather than shame. This dude aint no coward this dude a king! Mad respect to Will and all those who resonate with his message like I have. And mad respect to all those who don't lol! RESPECT ERRRRRRYYYYBODDDYYYY!!! WOO!
Will smith kina looks like morpheus👀
Maybe next time try react on verbal insults by yelling.
Will should make an apology video for this apology video ☹️
These comments make me sick… when a black man suffers with mental health he’s mocked and humiliated. We love you will 🙏🔥
Joe Biden reads the teleprompter better than will...
bs
All men want to be him, all women want to be with him. He's being socially prosecuted, judged and punished for being HUMAN? 😐 - I, personally, as a black man, will not be part of the destruction of another black man. I will not EVER be part of the psychological, emotional nor physical destruction of any life in any way shape or Form for that matter. The man is one of the greatest of all times but you people, from your phones and laptops seem to forget that he is just like any of us, a human being.  On my side (hope you're reading this, no need to reply nor acknowledge) Mr. Smith, we love you (says my 7 year old) we were, are and will always see the best in you. Stay blessed, stay strong, you are part of the greatest love - the love of all.
Which was the part where he actually apologised to Chris? 🤷🏼‍♀️
It would be really cool now and honestly if Chris would forgive him and they could put this behind them they're both great men we all have our mistakes and issues that we deal with
What a clown .He means its affecting his money.3 months for this lmao...👎
Grow up
I want Will back. He made a mistake and he clearly had to go through the consequences. He is a human like all of us and we all can make mistakes. He tried his best apologizing and I know it is not enough for people. So when is it? When will we forgive him. Idk but I know we should give people a second chance.
Videos like this are the reason why we want the dislike count back.
Worst apology of all time
Did your mom make you do this? XD
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢
It's been four months btw
I will never watch any of your movies again
poor Will, when will you stop begging for people's approval? Why is people's disappointment in you your problem? Why do you have a need to be a role model for anyone? When will you put yourself and your inner peace first? When will you make your own inner peace and inner truth your priority? Ask someone you really trust (Dave Chappelle?) and do mushrooms with them in a therapeutic setting, and welcome whatever comes up, no searching, no looking, no wanting, no resisting, just be with the truth of your experience in the moment, and then from moment to moment to moment to moment... focus on your breath, sit with your truth whether it's pleasant or unpleasant, do nothing, it might not be pleasant, but it will be your truth, own it, cry your pain out of your system, welcome that pain, embrace it, embrace your darkness, that way your healing will start, and after a couple weeks things will start making sense to YOU. You owe nothing to no one. We're all human beings just trying to figure out this thing called life.
You still have a Career in the MIB Willy, Don't Worry!
As much as I loved Will Smith, this is a pure PR stunt to make him look good. All this is.
Ok who asked you these questions?
Firstly, Will, what you did was not right or acceptable in any way, shape or form. The people that have followed you throughout your journey and read your memoir understand why you did what you did. We don’t excuse it but we understand why it happened. Sending you lots of love to help you heal the trauma that caused such behaviour. Secondly, it’s amazing how people don’t take accountability for their mistakes yet they feel they can judge you.  People have made worst mistakes yet they have the audacity to hold Will Smith to a standard they don’t hold themselves up to. Life is about making mistakes and learning from your mistakes.  It’s not about making “little” mistakes, it’s about making mistakes period. Unfortunately this was a big one. People that don’t love you any more, good riddance. You don’t need their conditional love and admiration. You are a light, joy and inspiration which is why you are so loved and revered. One mistake doesn’t erase that. May you receive the love, support and guidance you need to help you heal and grow. We love you, ALWAYS!
damn yall messed up for saying CLM
He's wearing a cap so that's how we know he's cappin'🧢.
When C. R. WILL APOLOGISE TO W. S. wif's?
Take your time Will ❤️
you made this apology too much about you will. it’s not about you, it’s about the people you affected. which to your credit you did talk about, but you made it too much about you with phrases like “trauma” and “mentally affected.” if i’m looking to forgive someone for an apology, i’m looking for them to own up to their mistakes not to make me feel bad for them
Didn't have a care in the world kicking up your heels at the Vanity Fair after party though. But now, 4 months later, here you  are? Yeah, that's believable 🤣🤣
This was 100,000,000% unnecessary be a man! And say sorry to someone without needing to make a video on your stupid YouTube channel. This is the equivalent of giving homeless people money (whilst filming) cause if you didn’t film it; it didn’t happen.
Apologized to everyone except chris...
Hopefully Chris can accept your apology but I won't blame him if he doesn't. Respect
Lol@ these random people saying "we forgive you Will" as if he somehow molested them all individually. Get out of it you weirdos 😂😂😂
I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT WILL SMITH!
I believe that all is forgiven. Keep going and do not stop. To those that are still mad at Chris for this: There is no reason to hold a grudge against him for his actions. If there is that imperfection that you despise and yet, you commit acts similar, how is it any different?  Regardless, stay safe Will. The world can be unforgiving, but I hope that there will be more that are able to go past this.
love Will Smith
Hostage video?
That was quick, must have a new movie coming out...
I think I respect Jada’s boyfriend even less for letting Will do this apology
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       !
What a day come a legend need's  to apologize. Why this world didn't end before this
You have always been a role model and you still are.  We are living in some strange times.
#CLM  ✊ CLM 4 LIFE
You’d think as an award winning actor he’d be better at pretending to be sorry
WHY IS HE LAUGHING STILL!?!
Please divorce jaden
Wait, is this an apology or an interview without an interviewer.  I really was hoping to hear something that felt sincere but it just felt like him working on his PR and giving an interview without actually on an apology tour. This apology is for the viewers seeing him react on live tv, giving the people what they want to hear so he can try to get past it in the public’s eyes.  It didn’t feel sincere and it definitely wasn’t for Chris.  All that we need to know is, after the two of them are both ready to hear what the other one has to say, that they’ve talked and are working on getting past this.  This was more: here’s the apology everyone keeps talking about, Chris still won’t give me an out so I’ll just throw a video on my YouTube channel.
L + ratio
Apology excepted, tomorrow is never promised, he did the right thing and it wasn’t easy 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽
Will, drop the bald broad, she’s done nothing but hold you back And trip you up
Wtf is clm?
Were all human, and we make mistakes. I'm glad he's finally apologized publicly. We will never really know if he's sincere or if it's just a PR stunt, but I'm glad he has expressed that he is sorry for how he handled the whole situation. It takes a big man to admit you messed up.
Why dress like tiger woods, didn't mean to do it thing?
This is just a generic YouTube apology video
automatic dislike.
To put it into perspective, what if instead you did this to Wanda Sykes? Anyway, continue to manipulate your audience to restore your career. It certainly does work.
❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾
@2:30 Really? Good thing you didn't bring your gun!
He’s not sorry, he went to the after party and partied the night away 🙄
Everyone makes mistakes, and we all experience times where we aren’t thinking clearly. Massive respect for coming out with this, I think I speak for many in saying you are still very much liked and admired.
He is still so handsome!  :)  I think that he is doing a good thing here - too much jargon and what not but good for him.
The bad title already tells me you're not taking this serious L : 94k DL : 152k
I would pay money to see the dislike bar right now
Hey why you talkin like that
Denzel said to Will after the moment: "At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you"... I still can't understand why you did that to Chris, so I can only remember about Denzel's speech. So strange.
🤡🤡🤡
Nothing bad to say about you. You said there were two things and only said one. I'm here wondering what the second thing was?
WHAT IS CLM?!?!?! Sry idk
Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw Sorry Will Not good enough.  it's all down hill from here Man just take the L.
Hope he still has his acting career.
3 months too late
Man you were my favorite actor Will smh… since I was a kid you were always one of my favs….few actors have the clean career you did, a legend. But also we all make mistakes regardless of the success you have.
Hi will smith sorry for making a meme about you a few months ago lol
94k likes  154k dislikes
That's the whole point of being remorseful. You should feel less of yourself.  That's part of being human. Allow yourself to feel the good and the bad.
It's ok u are a human after all we all made mistakes sometimes but it's ok you are still best actor for me ♥️
Will remains out of touch and this shows.
Nice.
Man nobody cares. As much as I still admire wills career. It’s very narcissistic to believe that we waited all this time for an apology. And to speak as if it just happened makes it even more cringe. This man needs to just stay out the camera and figure out how he wants to live the rest of his life. Cuz the public is moving on from him.
Most likely irreparable...you knew what you did man.
People need to realize that Will is a human. Yes, he had a moment, and yes, he could have done better, but what is a moment compared to a lifetime? If cameras documented my “moments”, I assure you that you’d think the worst of me! None of these people are without guilt, so they ought not judge Will. He apologized, accepted responsibility, so let’s move on!  Isn’t there a war in Ukraine that needs attention? What about kids and innocent people losing their lives over foolishness? Can we focus on the more pressing issues please?  Ijs. I love you Will! Keep up the good work. Pick yourself back up, those who love you are still here. You’re not alone sir.
Does anyone know the brand name of the cap Will is wearing?
Thank you Will. We are all human, and we all make mistakes. It’s recognising what we’ve done and trying to put right that makes us decent ❤️
Will didn't even say the words, "I'm sorry."..... What a fing clown
we stand with you will  stay strong! CLM
I think you should have laid low for a year, maybe even just faded away. You've got plenty of money, your grandkids won't even need to work. I am no longer fan and won't support any of your movies. Do all the soul searching you want, but you bullied a man physically in front of his family and millions of people. That's never ok. Then you accepted an award with no apology. Finally you topped of the night dancing at the afterparty, award in hand, as if nothing happened.
いつでどんな時も大ファンです‼️ 日本から応援しています😊‼️
Was that a script in the background?
Dude move on already
Everyone needs mercy and forgiveness. Internet is a cruel world.
It’s ALL Good… Love Wins In The End. Time To Get To Work, LFG💪💥💥💥
THAT'S WHY U R BEST ACTOR 🙃☠️
Is this dude Fr 😂 giving apology after 3 months. Nobody Cares now
As human beings, we all have done things that we wish we haven’t done. We tend to forgive others easier than ourselves and I totally understand your struggle. Just pray to God every day to help you overcome this feelings. Hope that Chris also prays to God to help him to forgive. Take care honey.
Sorry dude this just isn’t genuine. It’s the classic YouTube apology lol.
I understand its hard to make an apology, but dude, just be genuine and let the guard down. If you care, do it privately. Sheesh.
Bad actor studio...
yikes dude
Will you are okay .
Lmao
Not the different camera angles try to get us to sympathize☠️
if you would hve done this earlier it would have been more impactful
Why you talking so weird
Okay just; why doesn’t he just say ‘that really wasn’t okay at all, I’m so sorry - in that moment, I became so agressive because (his thoughts) but immediately after understood how unacceptable and crazy it was to actually act on that agression. I’m just so sorry to chris and everybody involved and hurt in that action. — it seems like he skips the core of the moment, the emphasis on apology but emphasizes the hurtfulness of his action in a seemingly arbitrary and un-emotional way. That’s where he loses my belief in his words, although he does actually seem remorseful. It’s the way he goes about his taken responsibility which make it seem like he doesn’t get it, or isn’t on ‘our’ side. Hope this helps in some way, you never know
Lol pleb
Love you Will We all love you
People make mistakes. It’s part of being human. It’s not my experience to forgive, but had it been I would have been able to find forgiveness within myself. It’s not going to change the enjoyment I get from watching Will Smith movies, not at all. One impulsive, poor choice shouldn’t haunt someone for the rest of their lives. Nobody died, Chris handled it as well as he possibly could have, and the show went on.
For those still stuck without seeing dislikes, we're sitting at 93k likes and 151k dislikes at 10 PM Pacific July 30, 2022
That was no where near close to being remorseful. Not the optimal? You acted in unforgivable ways and you talk about not being optimal?  You still dont get it and deserve never to be in front of the camera never to earn another dollar selling your image.
this is all an act a big one
What does CLM mean?
Some people think their lives are so important
He is relay a good actor
🍋 Power to you KING! Nothing to be ashamed of #CLM 🍋
Better late than never....not in this case. Pathetic
Well acting, no wonder they were willing to pay you all that money. Hopefully Chris doesn't accept this BS apology, his ONLY doing this because his losing money, reputation and his "love."
Hope it all get sorted out and u guys can move on and love each other again
Talk to me if you need someone to talk to anyone I been through it all god bless you guys!!
“It’s been a minute” No, it’s been a little over a minute, more like *four months*
The "uh" sound he makes says it all 💀 he ain't sorry at all
Why is will Smith wearing a Wario hat
redemption, i hope you find it will, thus all you can do now is carry on, do better and be better to people and dont let things get the best of you ever again, ever.

Will Smith is "a vessel of love" like Charlie Sheen had "tiger blood and Adonis DNA".  Totally out to lunch and not coming back.
*"Be the change you wish to see in the world." - if you fucked up, surely you'd want some acknowledgement to your apology and then move on, no?*
The thing that will bring you down is the thing you didn't heal before you had the power and position.

You lost me mate, was a fan, my kids loved your videos, but having to explain what you did, wasn't right,
KEEP MY WIFE'S NAME OUT YOUR F---ING MOUTH😱😱
This is why YouTube turned off dislikes, so no one looks bad in any situation.
To me this seemed like a genuine apology and he answered many questions which I think was brave to even make this for everyone to hear. It’s not even our business to force someone to tell us all these things. But he did this, so I think he does feel sorry and I do wish both WilL and Chris the best.
WE STAND WITH YOU WILL ✊🍋 CLM FOREVER
♥️ 15 seconds doesn’t erase 30 years.
Do yourself a favor.... Get a divorce.   Seriously.
Wonder how long it took for his publicist to write this up
Honestly he apologise because he felt sorry for himself but not what he did to Chris. A little too late huh after all the bans and backlashes.
Andrew Tate is disappointed in you
Everyone has a breaking point and grace should be extended. People are self-righteously judging this man like they've never had a moment of shame. I just pray for healing and understanding for all. You are still a great man, you are not the mistake you made. Keep holding your head up, stand tall, and be the man we all know you to be!
He apologized but never said sorry. They are two different meanings.
Do a hot wings.  That’s punishment enough.  We understand boo🙏🏽❤️🌱🥰
Was he playing golf?
Go away already, you're just making it worse...
Where is Jaden after his tweet ?
Ah, its rewind time
I think he's sincere about the apology. C'mon man everyone knows that sometimes our emotions can get the best of us, especially when someone makes fun and hurts the ones we love.  It was wrong yes but like he said we're human and we make mistakes. Everyone deserves a second chance.
I feel like we should all move on, life is too short. Yes he could've handled this situation better and he acknowledged that. He can't move on within himself if we hold this one bad thing he did. Why can't we measure the good against the one bad thing he did. Why hold onto that and dismiss the good he's done. We are all imperfect, we all make mistakes and he acknowledged that too. Let's let this good man and his family move on and get on with living with life, because without mistakes we never learn. This is how we journey through life with mistakes and learn to do better because when we know better, we do better. Much love from Queensland Australia 💜
Only way to make it right is for him to be publicly emasculated in front of millions
Tu me hiciste llorar tu me hiciste reir de Niño, de adulto tu me hiciste soñar  , you're important you matter you're not alone and you're loved .  If somehow you get to read this , I watched you on tv and movies before my dad died and after . Before I made mistakes and after.    You're not your circumstances you're who you choose to be , be the person you needed the most .   Uncle Phil would hug you and love you .
never would have thought to see an apology by the one and only Will Smith
After 4 months no one actually cares anymore
bro tf you apologizing that is like a highlight of the year
Let's go for the CLM (Corn Lives Matter) movement 🌽🌽🌽🌽
Welcome back Will 👍
To the town of Agua Fria, rode a stranger one fine day Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip For the stranger there among 'em had a big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip It was early in the mornin' when he rode into town He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around "He's an outlaw, loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip "He's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip" In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more One and nineteen more Now the stranger started talkin', made it plain to folks around Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town He came there to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead Said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red, after Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip Twenty-one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip The mornin' past so quickly, it was time for them to meet It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street Folks were watchin' from their windows, every body held their breath They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death About to meet his death There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground Oh, he might have gone on livin' but he made one fatal slip When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip Big iron, big iron When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip
I respect will For taking the time to think about his decision and for apologizing for what he did
_🍋💀_
In the first couple of seconds, you can hear a team of people. Will hired a team to make a youtube apology video 🤣
Will has finally apologized, now it is time to move on, there are more important things to worry about.  Goodbye and have a nice day.
This man is light, he's special, i believe he is sorry
You've ruined it my man. Can't even watch Fresh prince anymore. Hope you get the help you need bt you've lost a fan of 30 odd years. Many fans actually. All the best.
too little. too late bro.
no longer a fan of ws.
Will was suppose to take over for Denzel. We still love you, just disappointed.
So many degenerates in the comments smh
People always think words will cover for actions
Take a page out of Mike Tyson’s life. He doesn’t pretend to be perfect, he is who he is. He is human and rages like we all do. Your apology won’t make us believe you are the perfect person Hollywood wants you to be. Be like Mike, admit your rage and you will be authentic. You probably haven’t felt authentic since 1985.
If you're really sorry, you talk and deal with the person youve hurt, you work something with THAT PERSON. I feel like this video is more about saving his image than anything else.
lmao
I think he’s apologizing because he felt the wrath of society. Not because he genuinely felt he did something wrong. If the world backed him up in his action, then there would be no apology.
Will Smith definitely is a great Actor.
🤮
Should’ve not said anything at all. What you did was wrong, period. Words are meaningless.
The way He said "I Apologize" in the slowest way felt like He had to say it because there's gun pointed at his head.
I’m still your friend bruh.
Wtf is this DeepFake 😂😂😂😭😭🤣
My first time using an elevator was an uplifting experience. The second time let me down.
One of the apology videos ever made
0:10 Me after opening and drinking a fresh can of soda
That is a real good acting job.  He really acted like he was sorry.  Well rehearsed.
I always with you you are right but in that situation I always support you in any situation ❤️❤️❤️
Really sad and hopefully Chris Rick finds it in his heart to forgive him.
Will, it’s going to get better. I know you’re going through a lot but when the time comes, try to have that talk with Chris alone and one on one. No cameras, just the two of you. God bless.
Turn off the autocue
I don't believe a single word in this video
What a good way to promote your son's drink! Smfh
The 4 months of pegging finally paid off it seems.
Bro💀
Love u bro
A step in the right direction.
Dislikes count by now: 151k dislikes Update 1: 157k
Will Smith, I just hope this ends soon and you can continue to shine like you always have. This will end and everything will be fine.
okay, thats sincere. when he acknowledged that it was "foggy" back then. i kinda felt he has already thought about what happened. good job sir! i hope youre getting enough help on whatever u are going through. thats the will smith we looking up to.

If the number of dislike button was still active til this day, best believe that this video is going to be one of the most disliked videos in youtube history.
Lol didn't I see they were making a new bad boys movie...great timing on the apology will...great timing indeed 🤣🤣
Like a right of passage, you're officially a YouTuber. Congrats, Will.
WS needs to come to terms with the fact that he became a product of the whole woke/victim movement. Sad but there is redemption to be had.
You took your time to apologize; it’s going to take some time to see if this apology is enough for me. You indeed let us down!
cap
GO AWAY!!!
This is the most over exaggerated situation ever. There are actually real issues in the world people should be alarmed about, this doesn't even make the top thousand. It's gotta make you wonder about society, if this is the stuff people are worried about. 🤔
i love will but i don’t buy this nonsense & if i was chris i’d never reach back out no apology can erase the disrespect that’ll forever be on the internet as a “meme” at that & at that mans expense 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
You still need to apologize to Videogamedunkey for taking all of his subscribers.
Man, the production quality of this impromptu, intimate, personal video is phenomenal.
93K likes, 151K dislikes (source: ReturnYoutubeDislike)
Too late and doesn’t seems to be an honest apology. He really needs to get divorce and do a way better job. All his image was fake! And allowing her to sleep with someone else? Hell no!
Thank you Will, we’re all a work in progress. To be human is to be fowlable, I hope none of the damage done is unrepairable. Just keep doing the right things and the universe will take care of the rest.
93k likes 150k dislikes makes it clear
This would video would have been more appropriate 4 months ago.
I think it’s too late
It's cool man, don't worry about it. Been a fan for years, still a fan.
You really don't get it, do you?  THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL.
La única, después de pensarlo mucho, realmente la única forma de ser perdonado es si él mismo se enfrentase a tal humillación publica ya sea una bofetada a su rostro o algo más. Ojo por ojo...
🐐🐐🐐🐐
Will Smith has lost me again. Dude, Chris said he’ll contact you when he’s ready, why are you pushing him? You attacked a man on a global broadcast. You don’t get to pick the redemption schedule, and by doing it publicly, you made it about you… again.
let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone! God forgave you already. Go be happy then.
Who advises and mentors Will? This is embarrasing.
There's only one way you must do if you want us to accept your apology: lose to the Racers on the day the first Gran Turismo game was released.  You lose, you'll live. You win, you have to keep driving, don't stop and don't ever come back to your "perfect little life" ever. Don't care if you become like John Cena from F9 or as mentally unhinged like Dreyfus from the Pink Panther movies.
A lot of people are gunna meme this but whether or not he’s acting (I mean he is a great actor) at least he apologized. Meanwhile Alec Baldwin is like “NoT mY fAuLt” when talking about pointing a real gun at a person with his finger on the trigger and blowing them away.
I love the "sigh" right in the beginning. Typical youtuber apology response. How long did it take you to rehearse this BS apology?
I wish we can see the dislike button
When Amy Schumer said, "It's traumatizin' time," I was shaken. This was truly the most movie ever
You can see he was having problem and he seem going to therapy to help his issue. Nice going Will, stay strong
I still respect Will no matter what
I can't believe anyone thinks they can put hands on or disregaurd people's space or options. Uncalled for on so many levels. Just a cry out again for the poor Smiths ...give me a break
Will Smith I’m not happy, UNSUBSCRIBE
"The only way to atone was to never be vulnerable again. Perhaps he wanted to become the monster he already felt himself to be, perhaps he was just afraid of loving someone. Perhaps he was just afraid of growing old. Will Smith is a complex case. He's like an anthill, the deeper you dig the more tunnels appear and inside each is a creature ready to bite. Layer upon layer of bravado facades, contradicting desires and intensely wrought obsessions, but beneath it all, I suspect you would find just a normal man, with a wounded heart and a broken dream." -Koenma, Yu Yu Hakusho
Hate to kick a man while he’s down, so I’ll just say, A fan no more.
Maybe not apologise to us but apologise to the guy you embarrassed so hard that he‘ll remember it for his whole life
celebrity is a hell of a thing. This doesnt seem like a very genuine video considering the production value, the sigh and the walking up to camera.  Seems more like an actor getting ready to act tbh.  The guy probably knows that hes made a mistake and regrets it, but couldnt you srs just make a one man, face to camera apology and be genuine? Not this strassberg looking acting.
Man's set up 3 Camera's with one of them being a slider motion Control rig to really enhance his "apology"...
I accept your apology🐐
That succubus looks dudes soul.
you couldn't even post an apology video without displaying your water brand! Were you looking for sponsorship for the past 4 months before deciding to push your own brand?
People are saying CLM and my first thought was cl1t loves males
This is how it was planned. Have you not seen the other apology video from other posted in like next day or within a week. Had no affect on people! So his or his team strategy was not to post apology directly because most will feel its not real. So what they did here was to take some real time and make it like he went on some healing and now he is ready and hopefully people will accept it. But obviously it did not work either. So what have we learned? We learned that it doesn't matter if you take 1 week or 6 months to post apology. I think it will matter how you come off when you doing it.
If Will Smith was Caucasian, he would have been lynched. The double standard needs to end. Slavery ended years ago! Will Smith shouldn’t be able to make such a monumental mistake and return after four months to begin making millions and millions of dollars. Aside from that, the double standard given to celebrities also needs to end. Smiths career should be over! This is the nothing more than the Smith families need for attention. In fact, as I was quite sure I knew the level of sincerity that would be shown would be at the same level as Red Table Talk, I opted to not waste my time watching this “apology”.   Edit*** to be clear, I am NOT Caucasian. I am a person of color
What a terrible human
Good on him for doing this. Whether Chris accepts the apology or not, Will Smith does not strike me as a person who sat smugly after what happened. I thought it was straightforward & sincere. Kudos to him for trying to take responsibility, which probably 99.99% of the nitpicking critics here don’t do. Love you Will ❤️👏
I personally think his actions are extremely wrong. But I choose to forgive him and am sad to see him probably not acting
After watching "the boys" everything feels like a fake pr stunt. Everybody's reaching for power.
Who edited this?! It's a lot of cold cuts
"This is how we do" - Jaden smith.  L
Esse pedido de desculpas quatro meses após o ocorrido é muito tardio. Demonstra que foi friamente calculado. Soaria mais sincero se fosse realizado alguns dias após o fato fatídico. Demonstraria mais sinceridade. Lamentável!
all good everyone, he was just fogged out.
L
After four months his wife's boyfriend forced him to be nice?
Parabéns will
This is all youtube talks about. Everyone! even people whose main channel is gaming or art. I like this dude's movies, but I don't give an F about his personal life or what he did. In fact, I don't give an F about any actor or director, or movie worker's personal life. All I care about is watching movies/tv shows to cure my boredom so people need to stop obsessing with other people's lives and get one! Actors are just overpaid, narcissistic attention seekers. Acting is a job and nothing more! Ok, so you're in a movie, great job you're doing your job! Why do people treat these people like they're gods?  Always fixating on what they're up to or what they're saying. subscribing to their youtube channel or tweeter. Why don't people focus on people that truly matter, scientists, teachers, activists, the environment, engineers and etc? they are the ones that change the world.   I just had come here and make my comment because I am soooooo sick of celebrity drama.  Find another job, Mr. Smith. A job you can be proud of.
That was not an ordinary youtube Apology sigh™️, Will. That was more of a 'aaraagh'
If we humans had more courage to allow ourselves more vulnerabilty to our insecurities, we could grow immensely. Keep speaking the truth and let's all grow a better world.
149k Dislike.  Good drama👏and then he make clarification on the next video with chris🤣
Too many words. No action. That's my impression.
Will Smith is a class act. He did wrong and owned up to it.
consequences: I am not interested in seeing the movie that he was at the academy for nor anything else he plans to do.
It's gonna be a WHILE before Chris is ready.
It's all yours wife's fault
It took this man 4 months to say something, but however it's at least better then (Travis Scotts) apology, still i think this was a bad idea to post this due to the amount of times Youtubers did this and failed miserably "NOT ONCE" has this worked out....there's only one thing that needs to be said to this man "just stop" ....
Should have been a longer ‘minute’
#CLM Don’t let nobody tell you you aren’t any less of a man, not even your wife’s boyfriends ✊🍋
You lost me forever, Will :'(
I accept it but you're off my list from now on brother,good luck tho
Im a big fan will but i hope one day you'll left that women for good
I forgive you, but this lies in the hands of Chris.
Will, thank you for your heart felt apology. You are a good man
9.2/10 pretty good apology but the beginning sigh gave off a ingenuine vibe, over all great performance
I got your book! Looking forward to reading it. You have my continuous support!
KMWNOYFM
Bro really came in with the sigh
Will has apologized twice, the comedian hasn’t.
Can this get more dislikes than rewind?
Meu querido! O público nunca saiu do seu lado. Não  a maioria! Você  defendeu sua esposa! Talvez não  dá melhor forma! Mas isso não  apaga o grande ator talentoso que você  é! E ao que me parece, um excelente ser humano! Continue progredindo!
More people disliked this than liked it.
So weak an apology ☝️
youtuber apology in high quality lmao
Dump that b
Go on @killTony and make the appology.
dude reads like a 3rd grader 0:23
This sounds so fake. You sound like your on a script you didn’t practice and your reading off a screen for the first time. Okay you apologized, but it was horribly done. Don’t laugh in the video, there’s nothing to laugh about. Stop making us feel bad for you. Give an actual apology.
You're not an inspiration because you don't make mistakes bro; you're an inspiration because you go inside and challenge yourself to become better, every time.  Remember that. Time and love brotha, it's nothing that can't be healed. 🫂
this guy's a natural, the average youtuber needs at least a year to perfect the apology video yet will only needed a few months
Omg bro.....if you're sorry, then apologize and keep going. You just look like you're justifying and still second guessing yourself.  .....man you're full of yourself bud.
this lacked so much accountability and insight.. smh.. "fogged out".. shut up.. you weren't too "fogged out" to live it up at the afterparties..
Fraud
This is fake. PR team going ham
Diary of a sinking ship.   I would hope this is the beginning of a mass neglect of these man made Gods.   Wake up,  and focus on  what matters in this world.  This is a facade.
“Would like to ‘apologize’ to Chris” and his mother. Never did, just said he would like to. Then he says I’m sorry to everyone else.
Picture doing one thing and the whole world hates you for it literally what he did to Chris was wrong but everyone bashing him when he knows it is wrong let’s offer solutions and love one another
Querido Will, sólo espero que tengas la fuerza de alejarte de esas personas que no aportan ni suman en tu vida, todos cometemos errores, y también tenemos el derecho de reconocerlo a tiempo y pedir disculpas o perdón si es necesario. Te amo como actor, por lo que reflejas, por lo que has compartido a lo largo tu vida personal y profesional, espero logres superar y te hagas más fuerte frente a tus vulnerabilidades, y alejes de una vez por toda ese detallito tóxico a quien crees amar y que en realidad no te valora (no la quiero ni nombrar), salud, buenas vibras y un fuerte abrazo.. La vida es hoy, vamos!!!!💪🏽
Still plugging those brands during an apology.
"Thanx y’all" really?
You make one mistake and the world takes you down. Sad and desensitized world
I apologize... Damn man, this is sad. Delete this.
He is like…. Soft asf these days.
Sometimes I cant believe the comments here... yeah Will Smith is kinda a legend... but he's also still human... what would you ppl do if someone is insulting your loved one in your eyes? Could you stay calm? It was not the best way to handle the Situation... it clearly not was...  but it's still something Will & Chris should discuss for themself and for euch other out... and not over screen...  Hope Chris and you will find a way to Talk about and push it away to the past. Both sides got hurt, tht doesnt mean u cant be friends anymore. It'll take time and u both need to Talk about it. But I think you 2 are Old enough to get this fixxed ;)  Have a nice day Will
Todo mundo erra e um momento não tira o mérito do Will........ Como diria o T.harv "Pense antes de agir e aja depois de pensar e vejo o resultado do seu pensa+sentir+reagir = resultado".....
Yuh, it’s apology time!
Sorry Will. Too little too late. 👎
It's Willin' time
He's not even a YouTuber, yet pulled off the *PERFECT* YouTuber apology video!
Look I’m sure this is gonna be a journey for him and honestly some of this should have happened in the moment and not five months later.  It shouldn’t take five months to figure out that was wrong.  BUT we are all human and I would rather choose believe that he is in a process of making things right and moving on and I hope that happens.
Did will take apology video lessons from James Charles?
I think the wrong person is apologizing.
you very happy in the party ha
I honestly never cared you did what u did…u felt that in the moment…. U stood on business that u felt was worth standing on 🤷🏾‍♂️ imma still watch w.e you put out even if its a sequel to Hancock
If Will is even lucky enough he'll only be making straight released to DVD movies in the future
Why he didnt cry ?
This video proves why hiding dislikes doesn't work. They're at 147K, while the likes at 90K- at the time of writing
I wish we could see the dislikes on this video
Man made an apology after 4 months of thinking. I knew he’d finally come out and say it 🥹
He only doin this cuz of the public backlash
Will is such a narcissist
Me and my father grew up watching you and your movies. From your life's story to your future prospects. As black men in america we are appalled by what you did. You would have NEVER done that if it was someone like Tyson. Never should another black man support you. You degenerate.
Saying you’re sorry how you handled a situation is not an apology
YOUR RESPECT IS WELL RESERVED 👏 👌 🙏
👎DISLIKE
I had the utmost respect for you. You were one of my favorite actors. I loved your story and all your movies. Your actions have left me utterly disgusted. You should be punished. As of the incident, you will not have my support. You disappointed me.
I honestly still think it was Jada's fault. From everything I've seen, she seems to be very emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. I don't really like Will Smith, but I still feel a little bad for him too.
Amazing what wealth can do for you
Big ups.
travis scott and will smith with bullshit apologize
Cant wait for moist critical to do a vid on this
Will.  Lose the hat, brother.
For those who cannot see dislikes - Likes: 92K to Dislikes: 146K
I support you still Will.
2:18 - 2:44 didn´t he say at the same evening something about "protecting the familie" and "he had to do it" ...
you are still the man in my eyes will i love everything you do and im in it for the long hall threw the good and bad times my friend dont change who u are you are perfect just the way u are
GOOFY AHHHHH
I really want to give Will the benefit of the doubt.. I like will I really do. This is what a toxic woman can do to a good man. I’m a forgiving person, I hope the world can be the same.
Damn man… so disappointing seeing all this. He was supposed to be the fresh prince and he’s just….. this
This is mature, empathetic and logical. Thank you for taking the time to understand your impact and where this behaviour stemmed from. I’m glad you’re being a great role model by accepting responsibility apologising and being respectful and improving.  Being a disappointment is also a central part of my trauma. Something my therapist said to me the other day was that just because you’ve disappointed someone doesn’t mean that you are a disappointment. I want you to know that Will x
Say "sorry", not "aPoLoGiZe"
I cry BS! This is someone trying to save his career!
Did you make this video for your image or did you do it for Chris
He can’t tell me it was in the moment he did that . When he knew children was watching, the whole world. This will hunt him for the rest of his life no matter how much money or fame he gets.  He could have handled it another way when the show was over. Like Danzel said he let the devil use him, and no money in this world is worth loosing your soul .He sin  against God There is something  inside of him want give him peace. We all need to stop entertaining this and pray for him his mind body and soul.  That is a relationship that has been tarnished all because of Power Privilege Greed and no Justice. They talk about Jesus so what do you or I think we are better than him.
Was this message approved by your wife's boyfriend?
The term CLM is used to indicate a weak man.
Everyone makes mistakes, at least he is trying to own up to his actions. Most people don't even try to do that ijs
Do people actually still care about this? If so, we live in a pretty sad world
CLM Brother
I'm not angry with what happened, he's human, humans make mistakes, his just get shown a lot more since he's a public figure, but like mannnn, a YouTube apology fr?!?  nah, training arc failed
I LOVE YOU WILL ,YOY ARE A HUMAN AND YOU ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE MISTAKES IN LIFE
CLM ✊🍋
not gonna lie will we don’t care no more brodie
There's no redemption from this. Will Smith anything is dead
I don’t hate will. He’s just a puppet controlled by a manipulative hellcat.
The dislike ratio makes me wonder if people actually watched the video. Even if there were moments that were questionable, I feel like what matters is he apologized for what he did and he apologized to Will Smith. He knew that he shouldn't have done that, and he owned up to his mistake. Honestly, I feel like this video was enough.
"This is probably irreparable."
I don’t think this is over yet

You never stopped putting light, love and joy into the world. You’re the real deal. Give yourself a break after this totally Will Smith = Genuine = Brave apology. We need you happy too. 💐
people expect celebrities to be "perfect" with no fault at all. I think Mr. Will Smith with whatever that was going on at that time, he just snapped. And those moments can happen to anyone, anybody celebs or not.  For me, Mr. Smith spoke very well. And even if someone doesn't want to forgive you. It might take time to receive a response or not but at least you know you did the right thing before it's too late.
Hi Will Smith    You were right to defend your family 100%
🇯🇲 here for you Prince fly in for a few🛬🏖️ and chill bro😎
Very well, the first step was been taken, so the time and wind will help you in your quest. Greetings from Brazil!
Will Smith u are still my favorite, u just gotta make a comeback brother. I believe in you.! ✊🏾
Nice pr stunt. No one cares though. Stop giving money to cults though...
なぜスミスだけ謝るのか分からない、ならあのしょうもないコメディアンにお前は黒人の障害者だと言っても彼は怒らないだろう
wabam
You made a mistake, you took some time to be sorry without feeling the shame, and you're trying to apologise still. It's a bit thing to do and it is difficult. Hugs to you Mr. Smith. Keep it going and don't let this bring you down permanently 🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️
Sending love. You’ve put out so much love and joy over your career and I can’t wait to see everything that comes next.
THE WORST APOLOGY VIDEO EVER MADE😂 LOTS OF “Ummmmmssssss” and fake apologys
We never stopped being friends. But nothing wrong in being “ashamed” that’s also part of the healing process.
It takes a real human being to admit when you're wrong. Your a cool dude and a good man. Don't be ashamed of yourself. I'm not ashamed of you at all my brother
Okay, Will, you need to go to Anger MNGt classes. That's the only thing that will work. Ben Affleck also needs to go to Anger Managent school. Good Luck. 🍀 ❤️ 🧸 🐸
92k likes vs 145k dislikes   Yikes
Just admit this was all planned..
💔 We should stick together as one family, atleast in front of them.  The world watched this over and over... You have been our role model since we were young. There is still room for change and we BELIEVE yoh have the power to fix it ...💘 ameen🙏🏽and we BELIEVE in it.....
This is why youtube got rid of the dislike button. Hide response from the public.
You should have been removed from the awards show that night and you should have volunteered to give the award back. Lost a lot of respect for you
I want to appologize without saying sorry, just like the pope.
Goofy ah apology
Man that "The world is sick, Love is the cure" poster is some bullshit aint it...
CLM keep fighting the fight Brothers!!!!!!!
youve tarnished your own name, and this makes it worse
Te amo bro
Takes guts to do that, thanks Will.
I forgot all about this XD
Just say, "I hope we can get past this. Y'all know I fucked up. I can't answer everyone's questions. I made a mistake. It will haunt me, and the individuals I made a mistake towards for the rest of our lives. However, I'm doing the best I can to let the individual move on, as well as myself." Rather or not helping him in the future is optimal is one thing to do so, but what's important is to move past this as quickly as you can for EVERYBODY. Especially, you.
Can't wait for the body language experts opinion on this. 🍿
It's all good, Will.  Feel free to forgive yourself, now - and trust that everyone else will come around to forgiveness in their own perfect time (or never).  Nobody defines you but you.  Love them as they come.  Theres nothing to be ashamed of, at all.  Your life begins again newly, now, if you let it!  Love you.
it's really up to Chris. Will you physically attacked another person. Start with a  Therapist it can be put in the past thats in your hands.
We’re all human and sometimes we become reactive because of human nature. I truly believe Will regrets what he did. I think this experience will help him  release his ego and grow towards a more positive path on how he feels  about himself.
L apology tbh. You didn’t even apologize to your wife’s boyfriend for embarrassing his woman on national TV. You can do better, Will.
man idfc what u say i supported that desicion
It's a shame Will turned into the same type of people he moved away from...   West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood........ now you and Eminem have something in common, you both even take months to put together a lame response.
You should have thought about the outcome of your actions before you got up out of your seat.  I thought you were smart but you're not.  No respect for you.
We are only human and that means we make mistakes. The best part of this experience is that we are given the opportunity everyday to continue to grow and learn from them. This one moment does not take away from all the great ones to come. Chin up Will.
I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS WILL SMITH . YOU ARE CORRECT: WE ARE HUMAN AND WE MAKE SOME OF THE GOD AWFUL MISTAKES IN OUR LIVES.  BUT WE ARE BIG ENOUGH AND KIND ENOUGH TO FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER.  AND IF THERE ARE THOSE WHO CAN'T,  THEN THEY DIDN'T CARE FROM THE START.  KEEP WORKING ON YOURSELF TO CONTINUE TO BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE BECAUSE YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES YOU ENDURED IN YOUR LIFE, ESPECIALLY YOUR CHILDHOOD. WE ALL HAVE HAD PINNED UP EMOTIONS THAT ERUPT AND WANT TO COME OUT AND TELL THE WORLD WE HURT. I HAVE BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING NO WORSE THAN ANYONE ELSE HAS. TELL YOURSELF IT'S GOING TO BE ALRIGHT BECAUSE IT IT IS.
5:06  you probably should
I love you Will sometimes stuff goes down and yeah getting fogged out happens. All we can do is apologize and learn and better for it. Take it from a convict. I lov ya will and I love all and everyone else too. Be safe yall
What th hell
We love you Uncle Will
I'm glad to hear u apologize, it's not iur business but I hope people learn accountability at the least.
Say it to his face.  Not some scripted video taped crap.
He had more to say to Chris’s mom, his own family, and his viewers than he did for Chris himself
Your videos are the best I can see how much videos you’re gonna post on your page so I’m not gonna be on waiting until you post new videos on your channel thanks for bringing a lot of videos about you and your family to play with you where you live I please arrange it we do everything to make you happy I don’t know what else we can do but just let you know the best you tuber in the world thanks Bubba
Youre still my hero Will
🍋✊ #CLM WE STAND BEHIND YOU WILL OUR KING
Time to retire mate
We all make mistakes, I've made my fair share of inexcusable ones. I haven't lost an ounce of respect for you man, we see how you are on a day to day basis, we know this isn't somthing that's common with you. I'm sure most people can understand that sometimes under certain stresses your judgment may not be as its suppose to be. It doesn't make it okay, but for the fans who understand, and are real, we'll support you man, always have and always will.
lol.  OJ. Then Will Smiff.  Only one didn't do it, according to law.  Enjoy the simple life with the rest of us Will, enjoy the little things.  LOL.
idk how i got here but i swear im in the wrong timeline
Mr. Smith, you aren't fooling anyone. You're in an abusive relationship. It's now or never: get out.
OK but who positioned that lamp behind his head tho
Deffo reading off a script
Hey Will, good thing you never used "curse words" in your rap songs like all of those other rappers.
he pulled off the perfect youtuber apology video.
We all make bad judgements throughout our lives. Difference is people in the spotlight their personal lives are public knowledge. He accepted making a bad judgement. Accept it and let's move forward. The guy has spent decades making people laugh and smile. 1 mistake does not define anyone.
I can see that Will has been training for 4 months
He made everybody hate Chris popular by 100% . chris got a whole new fan base because of will.
I LIKE TO WATCH 🍋✊
You would of been doing a lot better thinking from behind bars. Bet chris would of been more open to talking if your call would of been collect from jail. Until I see some actual charge, or at the very least a massive fine, and community service. I get the justice system isnt fair, but to not even get fined... bet this video got him ratios into oblivion. I'm really amazed the comments are enabled. At least for noe
Will truly is brave to leave the comments on
Clm💪🙏
Hmm… basic YouTuber apology video, you obviously dont care, everyone forgot, no need to bring it up again.
This isn't even a real person
I wonder if they hung the picture to his right just for the video or if it’s always been there.  Interesting… 🤔
I think you did a good job.
For yall that dont have the extension im gonna show you the dislikes daily  Today: 143K
Will the Lord forgives forgives & and so has Chris. Now, forgive yourself. It’s a time of healing for us all ❤️
CLM✊
I know you are in the remorseful stage and should be. I think though Will there is a time to be silent and let things heal. You have been too public with your life in some ways and I think that, that, is part of the issue here. I think you mean it but I also think its too soon and this is something that is not on your time or in your control. Keep going to therapy and walking towards postive healing but no public discourse on things just yet. Time heals and puts things into perspective. Give it more time.
Just do movies dummy
Bro you lost so much for a toxic relationship. One moment of not controlling your emotions, basically destroying so many years of hard work in a matter of minutes.
Means alot to show that you care     For your sponsors
I think his acceptance speech spoke for who he really is. Not what his publicist tells him to say months later..
I watched you do it live.   It cannot be unseen.   You need humility in your life.   This is not enough.
Even if you get bad reviews for apologizing, just know it takes a strong courageous person to taking this on in the publics eyes.
THIS world is so much more than what you did AND yet the pigs made it ALL about you. (shocker)
Oh and after the video folks, don’t forget to shop the Will Smith store!
Alternate title: "Its been 4 months"
fresh prince 😎
this is just funny hahaha
CLM ✊🍋 WE STAND WITH YOU
Long live Will #CLM
🧢
As the Bible says in Roman's 3:23 "All have sinned & fallen short of the glory of God." Everyone repent & give Jesus your lives. Jesus is coming soon!
honestly, I forgot all about this
Always loved this man, but I can't get the picture of how Chris must have felt out of my head. My heart literally breaks for him. To be so humiliated to not millions, but billions worldwide. You won't see this Will, but do you know what its like to be bullied? I know the shame of it, not being able to defend yourself and feeling like you are nothing. That's what your supporters are saying to Chris.  You are nothing. So I pray Chris knows that he matters. You focused on the wrong things here. I hope you look deeper. You are an amazing actor and I hope there is healing
“Love makes ya do stupid things.”  Hopefully forgiveness can prevail.
Hey Will. Thanks for apologizing. All u can do is be honest. Everyone had something there ashamed of. We can't change the past but we can apologize & try to make it right. I feel sorry for Chris. Can u please repent & receive Jesus as savior. Jesus is the only way to heaven. John 14:6
Will smith 😍 we still love you
yeah ok 💀
Toxic femininity at work
People say it was fake and it looks fake.
It's been a minute? Nah 😒
👍you are the best and that was really nice 👍
yaah, its rewind time.
Too much arrogance and narcissism to the man.  The video did not help.
I think it would be better if he didn’t apologize unless it was right away. It usually just does the opposite effect with celebrities even if they are sincere. He has learned his lesson tho
You fell off bro.
The most narcissistic video from an unbelievably narcissistic man and it just comes off so badly.  Stop Will.  Just stop.  Keep this private.
Authentic YouTuber apology
💀☠🐒🍉🐔
“Yuh, it’s rewind time” He really made an actual good, YouTube apology.
It’s to late now.
It will always be a corny moment
Ka POW! 💥👋
If only Joe Rogan was hosting that day. You know he would have stayed in line then 😆
Will let himself down, let his profession down, and let down those who looked up to him.  Even his son, Jaden, got in on the action with the tweet "And That's How We Do It." after the ceremony.  Gonna take a while to wipe this stain off his reputation.
OOF The 142,000 dislikes tho
I stand behind you Will. 100%. You made a mistake. Nobody walks on water. Apologize to whomever you have to. And, of course, especially Chris. Let the rest fall where it may. You are loved. Unconditionally. Thank you for all your entertainment and laughter. Good luck Son. You seem 1000% authentic and sorry. I wish you the best. I Believe in you. It will all work out. God bless you
Why does this sounds like a deleted scene from Handcock lmao
Let Chris host the "Roast of Will Smith". Make it pay-per-View, let him take a good size cut off the top. End it with a hug and we can all go back to loving both of them.
:(
Yes she did say “do something!” She emasculated you constantly, why accept that Will? You are better than that! Or are you? Yes I feel bad for you to a degree, but Chris I feel terrible for. It was incredibly selfish.
He sounds like a robot at first
Haha it's rewind time! Oh wait, this is reality never mind whoops
I appreciate one thing about his statement. And it is the fact that he left the comments open for people to express their opinion. I respect that.
he made a mistake, recognized it, and apologized. feeling happy for him, it's not so easy to achieve this. and people should not judge him, you weren't in his shoes at that time
I like cats.
Will I be legend 2 continue to be a thing?
141K dislikes vs 91k likes LOLOLOLOLOL
Surprised you staged yourself with a white cap and bright light behind your head. Disturbing composition.
So I'm taking from this the work offers haven't exactly been flooding in lately.
Feels fake tbh.
The product placement for his son’s water company really gets me 😂 😂 😭
God bless you Will.
Why does he talk like that?
lmao the sigh sitting down. fuckin classic
"its rewind time!" nah bro
This Video has 142K Dislikes. 2022/Aug/07 237K Dislikes. NOICE
W mans
Bravo! Sólo los grandes y humildes saben pedir perdón
Whatever…. If you’re really sincere, you don’t apologize publicly… you would just wait for the other person quietly…just another show…
We are all human and make mistakes. I think I can speak for everyone by saying that this video was a step in the right direction and we appreciate it
I really want to see that like to dislike ratio
In about a year a youtuber is going to post a "Rating youtuber apologies" video and this will be on that list..... because I highly doubt he's gonna appear in many films sohe's merely a youtuber.   Also the fact that he did it in QnA form had me cackling  It's a good apology tho ig
There’s only one person who needs to forgive you and you won’t them in the YouTube comments
Great man, also keep Krishna's teachings in mind always 🙏
#CLM
It is often a difficult thing to separate personal life with professional life.  He seems to be having an issue with this and it is absolutely cringeworthy to have it blasted all across social media.  Mr. Smith should choose how he wants to present to the world and go about doing that, brief apology, less emotions and move on.  Keep your personal life personal.  There is so much we don't really need to know.
If you were truely sorry you would of tied your shoes
Lmao now I see why YT removed the dislike bar.
poggers
Why do I feel worse after watching this...
I wonder if Will has broke the record for the amount of dislikes.....140 goddamn bro!!
Booooo
This is by far, bar none, the funniest apology ive ever seen in my life...nearly spat out my food multiple times
Rewatch it ... still sound wrong ... blaming the victim 🙄... Rewatch n delete
Too soon dude take a break for a year or two and you’ll be back.
I have a lot of Will Smith movies, I  just dont watch them anymore, You lost my respect Will, Not sure how you can earn it back
Will is already a pro at the standard youtuber apology.
STOP CHINA'S CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF 2 MILLION UYGHUR CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS!!!
For what group of people is this video dedícated??? And why now??? It's useless.
Why does nobody know how to do an apology video? Is it really that hard to not pander for sympathy, beat around the bush, be cliché or shill during a video made to say sorry to someone?
it's too late to apologize.. sorry not sorry.. gtfoh..
my channel
we all know youre in an abusive relationship , you could have ridden the men too movement out of your situation and youd be seen a hero , but instead you punked out and didnt say you did it because she would let you hear it later.... we all saw you laugh will , we know you arent rotten , if shes pushed you to a point were you are trying this hard for approval , bruh , get out , you have a million eyes hearts and mouths ready to stand up for you , get good dude, those kids are grown , you can do better , your life has been so beautiful in the light , time to get rid of that darkness. I would have stood with you.
Wow 0 dislikes, this guy must be really good at apologizing for his actions
Will you is a beatifull man, i Love you s2
This guy hired a film crew for his apology 🤣🤣🤣. Video production- 8 Acting- 3
CLM. Take another minute, Will. Take a lifetime.
I don’t accept the apology at all
If will could just use that Nueralyzer rn 🫥
guys what’s clm in the comments??
Will is still one off The best Humans on this earth & should be looked up to not for what he did but for who he is yes he did a mistake but what's funny most people angry saying they lost some respect for Will but over 50% of those people did 10X worst things they wouldn't want to mention or even remember but fast to point to another ✌️
Chris not ready to talk, Will takes it public... Always a narcissist...  We all know he is only trying to save himself...
If you're going to make a genuine apology video why do all the product advertising? This is full of so much editing it doesn't feel like an apology but more like a justification. You should have made a raw video saying "hey, I f*cked up and want to apologize to Chris and his family". The end. It lets you off the hook and doesn't require anything from Chris or his family instead of making this overproduce drivel.
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Sorry but, I don't believe you are sorry for that. I just believe you're sorry its effecting your career. Just retire and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Promiscuity is the path of destruction, you can't see it because you want it to work so bad. Someone who cannot be faithful to you does not care about you. 🎶 She's for the streets, *YEAAHHHH* She knows she can't be faithful *Oooooh* I'm sorry but you know it's true, she's not in loveee with youuuu 🎶 there's a little freestyle r & b for you.../Toeface OUT
Like you said your are human and we all make mistakes. Nobody's perfect, I forgive you will keep doing great things In life. God bless.
You know what, @Will Smith. This is fine. Seriously, worse things happen. This is what grown-ups do, they apologize and move on. If you like it or not, you move on and live life. To me, you are still one of the greatest of all time. And honestly one of the better people on this earth despite all the drama. You keep on going forward, i hope you are fine and doing well! People still love you for you. And always will. (Pun intendend).
that "sorry babe" was so unnecessary.
Lol better keep his wife’s name out your mouth. While she’s putting her mouth wherever she wants
The reason why he didn’t apologise to Chris and his reasoning being that he was “foggy” was because he KNEW he did wrong, but he was surrounded by a bunch of fake, woke celebrities that like to preach to us all about how we should live and treat others, but in the heat of the moment, they backed the wrong horse. They gave Will A standing ovation, they hugged him, they supported him. They were completely out of touch, and that would have confused anyone. So while knowing Will was wrong, yet getting a standing ovation, he was confused, and soaked up the fake wokeism, and chose not to apologise to Chris.
when keeping it real goes wrong.
this is edited, and we dunno what part was cut off. thats when we start thinking if its 100% real. js
Good for you Will. We're all on this Earth trying to learn and grow. Best to you.
Irreparable now. Pretender apology.
I really can't dislike this, cuz he's "trying," but I'm also not ready to like it. If that makes sense.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." - John 3:16 KJV  Will Smith, you can have TRUE forgiveness in Christ. God loves you sir. This is a humbling life moment for you to turn to Christ.
This isn’t an apology video, it’s an orchestrated and rehearsed PR stunt to save his acting career.
Canceled
We all heard what he did to the actor playing Viv in thr Prince of Bell Air, she knew the real Will. How many years did it take for him to recognise what he did to her
Just be genuine
You might have been uncomfortable But you weren't offended. Chris did not disrespect anybody on stage. You're trying to say I should have been civil even when under attack .... I should've taken the higher ground but the truth is that Chris did not play any game or give you excuse to do it
Unfortunately, people immortalize mistakes and mortalize qualities.
Infelizmente as pessoas eternizam os erros e mortalizam as qualidades
No one asked.
your famous and you acted a fool and thats coming from one famous person to another
Who is asking these questions
Booooooo
I appreciate the intention of the video, and I think it's time we all move on from this. However, I have to say, what I personally feel from this video is that Will's logic brain understands what he did was wrong, but his emotional self doesn't. I didn't see regret, or emotion really, actually I felt some contempt when reading people's comments. Looks like someone, later on, edited the video and added the text lines "You asked a lot of fair questions that I wanted to take the time to answer" to soften the approach. I hope at some point he's heart agrees with his logic mind and can apologize to Chris privately, the way Chris really deserves.
“It’s too late to say sorry! 🎶”   -some white girl

Did you apologize to your wife's boyfriend?
How much did you pay your PR firm to come up with this?
production quality: 100 youtube apology total points: 100
Man this is brutal 3-4 months later
To all those who believe this is a real apology, look at the setup and think about how it took 4 months. This is a production. Dont hate or judge tho the man has been famous and acting most of his life so he probably forgot how to be a real person.
🍋✊ THE CLM MOVEMENT STANDS WITH YOU KING
Are the people in this comment section typing "CLM" (like wtf does that even mean is it a twitter thing ? cuz i don't go there i need my brain cells intact thank you very much )over and over again while also calling will smith "king " with a straight face are actual humane beings or just bots ? just asking cuz my god i got cringed into outer space from just two minutes in here
I do understand heat of the moment situations this remains me of the Mike Tyson thing but no one lost a ear. Both of you have to find a way and please make a collaboration movie after.
Enough already. This was an ignorant action that should have never happened.
This is better then the Travis Scott apology fr
Why does this video have 140K dislikes? What's wrong with those people. Will made a mistake and we all did. So don't think his the only one. Yes, a sorry is not enough. But Will is trying to fix his life. So don't hate this man.
Will Smith is a Good Guy period. He shouldn't be held on a higher pedestal where he's not allowed to make Mistakes  I would still watch a Movie with Will Smith. He's a Stand up guy and a hell of a Actor  Stay Strong Fresh Prince
Honestly will, this entire situation was funny asf- thanks for apologizing, but I personally did not care about the situation it was funny tbh
where's uncle phil? he needs to lay a beating on Willie Boy
You should be in jail.
Apology NOT accepted.   Now I wait for the hate or YT to remove my comment as usual but idgaf.
If there was no other people watching or camera, will you still apologize to Chris for what you did?
Nah you ain't sorry lmfao
Couldn't think of a more appropriate and dignified way of handling this profoundly akward situation.
He is human, we all make mistakes. Don't be judging unless you can walk on water.
Soooo.. instead of making amends privately to Chris as he's the only person that you should be addressing... you think it's a good idea to do a public apology as if that will help?  Did you not learn anything about airing your dirty laundry in public over the past year?
2:46 Definitely not at gunpoint.
Stay cool, stay safe.You are so loved💘💘💘💘
will você é grande tem uma estrela enorme, os erros acontecem e o mais nobre é reconhecer, os erros passados nao determinam o seu eu de hoje e nao alcança o seu eu do futuro, talvez nao apague as coisas que se passaram, mais no futuro sua historia vai ser tao linda que os seus erros serão despercebidos no corrente temporal, voces nos deu milhares de alegrias, eu sou brasileiro e me lembro o quanto voce me fez bem com suas otimas atuaçoes no maluco do pedaço e outros trabalhos, você tem um credito mundial de felicidade causada em varios coraçoes e eu da minha parte perdoo e sei que milhoes tambem o fazem, volte com tudo will voce e grande e sempre sera e nao serao seus erros que determinaram isso mais sim a quantidade de bem que fez ao mundo
Okay, what movie/reality TV show/brand is he planning on announcing to have made this 'thing'? No way he would have come out with something like this if it doesn't mean a chance to make himself the center of attention. Maybe a TV show that follows the lives of his family members 🤣
CLM ✊ WE STAND TOGETHER #CUCK
Video apology lesson... Sit down big sigh Looking down Have fried voice and heavy breathing Saying he apologises but not saying "sorry"  Then end it with infamous switching off the camera
will you are great you have a huge star, mistakes happen and the noblest thing is to recognize, past mistakes do not determine your self of today and it does not reach your self of the future, maybe it will not erase the things that have passed, but in the future your story will be so beautiful that your mistakes will be unnoticed in the current time, you gave us thousands of joys, I am Brazilian and I remember how much you did me good with your great performances in the crazy one and other works, you have a world credit for happiness caused in several hearts and I for my part forgive and know that millions do too, come back with everything will you are great and it will always be and it will not be your mistakes that determined this but the amount of good you did to the world
lmao wut u get for sticking up for sum ho that cheatd on ya x)
Pretty straightforward apology.  I’m glad you got to think it over and piece it together.
Bro started balding
Chris, I'm sorry my acting career is over...
Can't wait for a third of the community to accept the apology, a third to decline the apology and the rest to meme the apology.
you’re little late
Imagine if there was a dislike button
This post got ratioed by moist
I think he got some nice mentoring from Jeffery Star and Logan Paul before this video.
Will, stop apologizing. When someone is very successful, which is your case, there will be always tons of envious people waiting to see you fall, or waiting for any little mistake you make to throw it all in your face; regardless of how many goods you have done before. And these are really many of these people writing on these comments. So, stop apologizing, move on with your life and career and your true fans (me included) will not leave you. And all these envious leeches throwing rocks at you, just give them the finger, turn your back and keep moving forward.
Such a sad video from such a damaged person.
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
It's right to be ashamed of yourself when you've done something shameful. You can be ashamed without hating yourself.
Clm... means Chris's life matters
the exhale really made his point more clear

i'm going to pretend that I haven't watched this >.<

I dont really think there is any way that would have been "best" to apologize. People will take fault with whatever.  I appreciate that he answered to some of the questions people had. I was good with the twitter statement.

You did what was natural for people to do!  Nobody has an excuse to judge you when they'd do the same thing!

Will, in my life, in anyone's who is willing to admit it, there is that one thing, perhaps more than one, that they have done, they wish they hadn't.  Those moments, some of great consequence, with high prices to pay for our actions, we live with and hope we can grow from and overcome. We're also lucky in that for us our missteps, were not televised to millions.  It is not my place to forgive nor to condemn you.  I as are the rest of us are just witnessess to the moment.    This business will try hard to make sure no one forgets and fan the flames for viewers and ratings, you know this.  so do we if we would but admit it. I support you and all involved in this journey to healing, stand strong in that. I wish you all a much better and brighter tomorrow.  There but for the grace of............  Light & Love

Growing up as a fan of Will Smith's work, always happy to hear his name and excited to see more from him; this really just is sad to see. My respect for him is lost (not that it means anything), it is just unfortunate to see him become such a broken and delusional man. If this is the way he thinks he will continue to let people down including himself.

this video now has 138.000 dislikes and counting
btw 138k dislikes 😬
Sorry Will, couldn't watch to the end. I'm not even in a rush. Something just didn't seem right. Pray.
the dislike ratio is BIG
Will, don't worry too much. This single second does not change your full life's work and that you are the coolest man on earth.
go home will...it's over.. i will never watch a WS movie again.. gave away my dvd;s
Idc how much u apologized...you lost my respect regardless. 🤷🏽‍♀️
I'd believe him, if he weren't an award winning actor
When you do an apology video, not because it's the right thing to do,  but because you think it will restart your revenue again.  This doesn't seem sincere,  even with the tears.
Will must have really slow internet to have taken over 3 months to apologize
The smart man climbs down off the top of a mountain. Them some jump off the cliff. Will Smith is not the Fresh Prince. Pay attention.
R u being held at gunpoint
Slay queen
I wonder how many dislikes this video has!
What's the score on Rotten Tomatoes for this theatrical short?
nuance huh? Here's a tidbit for you. Saying I want to apologize is not the same thing as apologizing.
Nope
This is yesterday's news. Who cares? Let Chris and Will live and go worry about your own lives. Geeez.
Too little too late Will! This rather sounds more like Crocodile’s tears than anything else. Plus it’s not few months, it’s been almost 5 months of your ignorance to man up and have the courage to come forth and make a public apology to Chris. I am glad I am not making this comment in person, otherwise you would have smacked me down as well!? You have a shameful track record of such behavior in public. God knows what goes on in your private life and away from public’s eyes!
bro LEAVE HER
It's been like 4 months Will, no one cares. You could've just reached out to everyone and probably moved on. This was so unnecessary.
This is Will Smith's worst performance by far.
It's "I'm sorry". Not "I apologize." Anyone can apologize. But are you REALLY sorry? Try again.
Just not good dude.

Okay but does anyone know how David is doing?
Let’s not act like we ain’t all messed up in our lives.....welcome to the club ........we’re only human
No one cares will your done. Accept it
In other words: “I’m so sorry, please come see my movie I don’t want it to tank :((“
It's okay to be ashamed of the action, but go easy on yourself... You're a Human being, none of us are perfect. We have ALL done things we're ashamed of and regret. There's only ever been ONE man who sits high enough to judge you and He's all about forgiveness. Much Love and Prayers.
its just so media trained and performative
"I'm trying to be remorseful while not feeling ashamed."  you should feel both remorse AND shame; Willy-boy
We’re all human.
Has anyone thought that this video is probably monetized so we all just contributed a little bit to this man's obscene wealth?
All fuzzy. Really.
How many outtakes did he have in 4 months working on this apology?I  I want to see the outtakes.
um, actually… it has not been a minute, it has been 4 months 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Listen to those shatner-esque. pauses.   Can't wait for the MeatCanyon video.
Why does Will Smith apologize? The bad one is the moderator
Andrew Schulz is about to annihilate this man....
How awesome would it have been if instead of apologizing, he just owned it. "Chris, I told you to shut yo f-ing mouth. Did you learn your lesson or we going for round two?" Just 5 minutes of that. Ah man.
awwwww - thank you for continuing to do the work, and for sharing w/ your folks 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽 hangin in there cuz we never stopped being friends ~~~~~  (that’s good stuff, btw, of being remorseful w/o being ashamed 🌺)
I think his 4 months of training for this by the book YouTuber apology payed off. You can really see that he studied hard for this A rank YouTuber apology.
I am youtuber funny videos nice video bro
Hey Will...I love you.
will smith: takes a break for 4 months and uploads an apology for something that happened 4 months ago, Everyone: you suck
Will I hope you get better soon and this is just another learning experience that happens from time to time . I just want you to be happy and respect yourself more .
“I apologize”???? Mf just say I’m sorry
Seems convenient that’s he’s making an apology video shortly after starting development for the I am Legend sequel…
It’s finally here https://youtu.be/rZ8t9H0xpIc
Hope he picked the check up on the way out.
Nah
It’s like the Travis Scott apology video. Just cause his career is being thrown away then he wants to apologize, used to be a actor I could watch all day in movies but now I lowkey don’t care what this dude does anymore lol
Never looked at u different will only thing I’m disappointed about is there was never a I robot 2 😂
classic cinematic sit with a big sigh, truly one of the apologies of all time.
What a sad look, pathetic, pitiful.  This is why as MEN it is always nessasary to control your emotions at all times you must control your emotions or else you just look weak just like will is looking rn.
Someone get Jay Shetty
Sou seu fã, parabéns pela coragem de vir falar com todos. Estamos com você.
Atleast he didn’t pull a Travis Scott style selfie apology
This is faker than my existence
Wow no dislikes
Will Smith was really one of my heroes.  I'm disappointed. I know that we all make mistakes, but this is a big one.  But one of the questions that I have from this video is:  He said that he wants to live up to "other people's expectations of him".  I'm sad that you didn't say that he wanted to live up to "his own expectations" of himself.
If this was a parody like you bringing in a dog and other animals it wouldn’t been so much better. Instead we got this, no way this gonna boost you to get more awards, honestly i think this’ll make everything worst  for you. Also when you say “I apologize for my behavior” that’s not for him, it’s for your PR team. “I’m sorry” is personal and the correct response. This is such a stupid move. Stating quiet would’v been so much better than this
Calling that an apology is like saying Will Smith "wears the pants in his family."
Will, you are the reason that I started acting. Big respect
Thank you for apologizing and it’s time to move on.
Feels fake, repairing your image is more important than the people effected...handle it privately
You are only doing this to save your career. where were you after 5 months
He's so right, we aré all humans and Is our nature to make mistakes, he said he's remorsful and no body should judge him as we all make mistakes.
To those of you that can't see dislikes, the current count is 90k likes and 136k dislikes...
This video has 90k likes and 136k dislikes. I'm glad people aren't forgiving him this easily
It may be fake and pr, but I'm going to try to not be cynical about it. I can't recall Smith ever being a douche like this before, so I hope he is sincere. I consider myself a good person and I've made mistakes, I'd hope people don't define me on them. In the end it's just garbage entertainment for us as viewers.  I hope will and Chris can come to terms with it together, but I'm going to try not to judge this man off of this one moment, because I wouldn't want to be judged on my mistakes.
Love how an ad for the Will Smith store shows up directly below the video.  As if he needs even more money!
What Will Smith really wanted to say is *Its rewind time*
I’ve never seen talking horse before
life got flipped turned upside down
i bet he had the light from men in black right now
I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or su*cide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.
We Love you Will ❤️💕🥰. Nuff said!!
ka sgu meget godt li dig wil
Totally a different Will then I have ever seen but I know you will come back.
Parents just don’t understand
Wow, so much hate in here. The man is trying to make amends, respect that. Now he can use his actions to prove it.  He deserves a chance, y’all.
Will v. Chris is not over.
Les américains vous mettez tout à un niveau de malade. C'est juste une gfle ! Will tu es et tu resteras le meilleur. On t'aime encore plus qu'avant !
I feel like this was a mixed bag. Parts sound sincere and parts don’t. So hopefully Will is truly digging deeper into all the ramifications of his actions. I’m glad to see he’s beginning to understand.
I've made a severe lapse in my judgement.
#CLM
Imagine if this gets more dislikes that the rewind video he was on
Tie your damn shoes!
I wanna apologize so maybe some of my million dollar sponsors see this and think I'm sincere 😌 but if it wasn't for losing money we wouldn't be having this conversation so yeah uh for that I'm sorry...ps...this is not an act...🤞
Yo, this is cool  But did you know the first person convicted of speeding was going 8mph so to convert it kilo we get 13kmh
I don't think you are sorry
The poster in the background looks like drake album cover ”if you’re reading this it’s too late”
*"Trust takes years to build,second to break and forever to repair" That's an amazing quote right there!!!*

Good brother Will, I wear black but I'm not your or anyones judge. God bless you as you grow back stronger.  Humility is for all of us.  Be well.
Everyone makes mistakes....praying you are afforded the chance and opportunity like every other flawed human being to learn from mistakes and do better 🙏 I'm rooting for you my brother.
What’s with all these rude comments, this is a genuine apology and Will is a genuine person. All you haters need to be quiet.
your good bro
you did the right thing to apolozise however its been too long. also you need to be okay with chris not forgiving you. that is only up to him and should be completely understandable
So glad he didn't Laura Lee the apology video lol
Wow! You apologize and include a link to buy your autobiography????
I forgive you, Will. Thank you for your honesty.
manscaped
Fake
4 month of preparation 🎭
Glad you undertood what went wront Will. I wish you the best.
Oh man… even though this is obviously not an apology and clearly damage control (took a couple months to realize folks weren’t gonna let it go), I give points to his PR manager for coaching him on how to say “I take responsibility for my actions and I am sorry for what I did.” So, points there lol.
I wonder what the like/dislike ratio is in this video?
cooper I have no idea how I'm going to record this video dude
I don’t have anything against him but you can see that he is reading from something
Damn, ngl better apology video than other YouTube’s
Red pill saves lives , learn from Will .
Not that big of a deal, really.
Actually, It's been 4 month!
There are no complexities. We saw who you really are.
Nah. He’s apologizing. Who here never made a mistake?
It's hard to apologise, I appreciate you ❤️
its rewind time bud
Classic YouTube apology. All of the usual tropes - Walks into the room and sits down - Sigh at the beginning of the video - “Everything is fuzzy”/ I don’t know what I was thinking/ I can’t even remember it all - Says “I apologize” instead of “I’m sorry” - “I’ve just been replaying it all”/ I haven’t stopped thinking about it - “It’s such a complicated/nuanced situation” - Talks about their trauma and how the backlash has affected it. - “I’m sorry I let down my fans” - “I just want to bring light and good to the world”
let’s all call him Mr.Pinkett because we all know who wears the pants around here…
The right thing to do would have been to wait for Chris to be ready. But of course you force it into the public. Shame on you.
🧢
No1s perfect
I ❤ U, WILL!!!!!!
Thanks for the apology now show up looking like the apology has been implemented in your behavior moving forward
i hope he’s not laughing at these questions thinking we’re laughing WITH him… we’re definitely laughing AT YOU Mr.Pickett … definitely at you…
Goddamm Will you got the YouTuber apology starter pack but in all seriousness it wasn't that deep man you are a little late with this "apology" you should of just handled this privately with Chris bringing this up now after 3-4 months just doesn't feel right but I wish you the best and I hope you and Chris can move forward
*Likes: 90k* *Dislikes: 135k*
is he a robot ? 🤖
I have no clue what this really was meant to be, it was like "GQ does youtuber apology video" with the brand placement to match. it felt forced, scripted and Ingenuine while fully giving off the red table vibe that many fans tribute your "breakdown" to. the artwork in the background "the world is sick love is the cure" really does seem ironic when you poisoned the water nearly giving rise to other fools running on stage and attacking comedians. i really do wish we had the old Will back, but the fact that this apology is over produced shows you are still a puppet with another pulling the strings, maybe i was just expecting you to be real..... like phone in hand, speaking to those you let down.
If all of us can still see the dislike button this'll get the most dislike video
#CLM
LOOOOL really bad apology
You would’ve given the illusion of authenticity if you had just filmed a short apology from your phone.
A video apology seems disingenuous to me. Just man up and face him in person. I was a big Will Smith fan. But crap like this makes it hard now.
We all make mistakes. It was ..... all  that's left is to address it and move on .
Mmmmm, word salad
Why yall mad everyone needs second change
That Fake sigh at the beginning!..
I don’t see a wedding band.
Check out that dislike bar Will
Not Hearst felt at all. So phoney.
Just saying, through an extension: 89k likes / 134k dislikes so far
4 months too late.
Good job, Will. I'm sure you saved yourself from being blacklisted.
He fooled everyone in thinking he is a truly nice person in real life
Its the sigh at the start and the full white youtuber apology outfit for me.
Smart man to own up to your short comings but people must remember you are after all human and can take just so much
"Thanx y’all"  Is Thanks to you all   Learn how to type animal
W
I think the only thing he's missing is a dog to pet while he apologizes. 6/10 apology, just like your movies.
Radioactive much? Sorry bro, you showed how much of a POS you are. You're just *"sorry"* 4 months later because your career went down the crapper.
Dude you are a great personality and need to rid yourself of the destructive forces in your life
What does youtube have to do with an apology to chris😂😂😂...you guys have it rough(stars) ....these fans are savages 😂.. They will always have a side and some of them have common sense which they will use for sure against you 😂.... You reached a point where you dont own yourself but do things to please other people .. I pity you ... Cheer up and you live you ...😊 you f*ckd up Chris benefited just do what you do coz us common sense fans dont care about what you do .. Just produce good movies and we are good😂😂 We have lives already so we dont have extra time to waste on others😊
Stopped half way through... You will never be forgiven by the majority. You are a role model and behaved like a child
Wish I knew the time it took for him to come up with those "answers" and apology vs the time it took to create the "room" or set. I cant find a single sincere reason on why they needed 2 cameras.
134,000th dislike
Will Smith a good actor in yall believe this speech😂😂😂😂
Learn how to apologize!  Don't use passive phrases like "after what happened"... say "after what I did".  Also, don't you dare ask for Chris to give you a moment of his time... "I'm hear when you are ready" puts the ball in his court and that's not where it belongs.  It belongs in yours.  You need to apologize properly and expect NOTHING from him because he owes you nothing.  This is not rocket science.
Sure you are “ sorry”. You only say that to still have acting roles. Fake vibes
He made a mistake and he's apologised, fair play to him at least he recognises he was wrong and doesn't do it again that's the most important thing
Same vibe as Travis Scott💀
as said by countless others.. Too Little, Too Late. Go away!
Excuses 👍👎
☝️
not yall fr being mad 😭
You can apologize but people will not forget what you did and they will always remember what you did. Consequences.
This was as good of an apology he could do. He doesn’t need to let the entire world in on what’s going on behind the scenes or whatever else he’s dealing with

Hey Will, it’s okay. We all make mistakes. Tbh just as long as you (TRULLY) learned something and took a positive message from it, then everything else is secondary!
Man really started with the YouTuber sigh
Really nice of Will's wife's boyfriend to make Will apologize to Chris. What a nice guy.
I hope will and Chris can move past this. Cause I have
People can forgive, but in this situation - no one will forget.
Praying for y'all.
Logan Paul could never have pulled this off
I think everybody makes mistakes and I think Chris should really forgive him
Too late William
It's funny how he apologized after 4 months 🤣 😂  If suppose Will shot Chris with gun  Will he apologized after Chris death?  And take time upto 4 months or may be years?
L apology
Bro made a YouTube apology, you’re a professional! You had the sigh, the walking up to the camera…perfection.  Edit: I would say thanks for the likes, but that’s what everyone says. So I say oink.
Man you was like a childhood hero to me..
I can not support this comedian beater for one second more.  I can not support someone flies off the handle like that.  Not one more movie or song or one penny out of my pocket going to this joker.
Idiots gonna say it was an act of free masonry
You don't deserve eternal damnation.  Peace to you and your family.
We don't care 🥺
I apologize and I’m sorry are two different things to me.
Top 5 YouTube apology video of all time lmao
Respect is hard to earn and easy to loose. Its over for will smith, let someone else have his spotlight
Bro is this supposed to be comedic satire?? Will this is 4 months too late and you’re just embarrassing yourself all over again.
This is NOT an apology Will. It took you 4 DAMN MONTHS to apologize publicly to Chris. This is DAMAGE CONTROL. It’s up to Chris to forgive you and I hope he does but he won’t ever talk to you again, you don’t deserve it. This will follow you everywhere you go. It’s too late!!!!!
Sad truth, I try to provide good and useful content, but no one encourages me 😔💔
✊CLM! I support you brother.
people saying this wasn't that deep enough for this don't remember his career got ruined cause others were offended for something not that deep
He talking like a text to speech bot.
89K Like. 133K Dislike  Nice!
Everybody is gonna cry and be pissed about it no matter what you do just own it will
89K Likes and 133K Dislikes... For those who can't see
Lol
This is exactly the reason why removing dislike count was a bad idea Everyone get yourself "Return YouTube Dislike" browser extension
Much love Will.
I Just Thought It Was It Was Funny Although I Find Chris Hilarious 😂 I Didn’t Find It A Big Deal But I Did Know Chris Wanted To Say Something Back That Would Totally Roast Will So… Yeah,…. I Guess. In Conclusion Thank You For The Meme. :)
People are letting this effect them way to much… It is crazy how people are so vocal about this but when it comes to real problems you say nothing
All I can think of was Shop the Will Smith store
Lol
In the Bible says we must forgive those that have hurt us and move forward so will Smith chris has to forgive you prayers for both of u 🙏 🙏 🙏
Qu'en pense notre sociologue à lunettes ? #videoscopie
#CLM
In other words "I'd better say something because I'm losing too much money in lost roles and endorsements, plus I don't want to sell timeshares with Armie Hammer".  Humility in admitting to faults quickly, is a character trait you should have learned by this age.  May others learn if from your poor example and save themselves such pain.  The apology should have been " yall, I screwed up. I've been stressed out and reacted to something out of anger.  It was completely wrong and I will never stop hating myself for hurting an innocent person and embarrassing my family.  Chris, I am so sorry for what I did to you, would you please forgive me?  I am so ashamed of hurting you like that and I am willing to do whatever it takes to work through this with you...Will"
Will Smith forgot to say the words "I'm sorry", it's almost like he's never had apologize for anything his entire life.
Erobb221 was your brother
30 years to build up a reputation to ruin it in 30 seconds! Hope the 🐈 is worth it!
Did he say “sorry” to Chris or “I apologise”
2.5 mil veiws, 90k likes, i wonder the amount of dislikes
Imagine he took a sponsorship in this vid that would be so so funny
Hollywood and their never ending narcissism , the whole world sees how that evil woman does you however she wants , grow some will and take decisions on your own
You wanted to come on the internet this what happens son, leave that devil of a woman
Get it together ..you actually need to leave Hollywood for about four or five hrs and become a well balanced, self actualized man..Tell Jaden I said hi
who cares
the dislike ratio now its 89k upvotes against 132k downvotes :)
Get that will Smith smack
And that's the way we do it
Proverbs 17:9
get lost will
Aside from all the generic youtuber apology stuff, this is not a bad apology.  Still don't get all the hoopla
Eric Lamont Robbins - CLM supports you chris
Everyone deserves a second chance.
spectacle of the spectacular
It’s the guy from fortnite
Truly one of the most apologies of all time
I still think it was staged, I know I’ll get hated on but it just was so weird
Hes an actor..
Why are some of you guys being so hateful that he’s apologizing again. Stop, please. Don’t kick a dog while he’s down. We all do wrong. All of us in the comments do wrong but most of us aren’t famous. So instead let’s encourage him because if we were in the public eye we would want the same.
Its been 4 months*
So sorry look at you in that place man. Always I see you like a example, like a man man, like a good father. And a. Good person. My opinion isn't change. This is a first step. I know is hard to hear but you must to take distance from that woman. She is a bad person and she is a evil woman. Good luck
We as fans keep forgetting that these celebrities are still human and they make mistakes just like we do we tend to put them up on a pedestal and look at them when they make mistakes with the side eye, and that’s not fair I hope that Will and Chris can work things out but it’s not up to us fans it’s up to Will and Chris. You know it takes a real man to admit when he’s wrong and he did it in front of the world some people can’t apologize to one person in a private way 😒🫡🇯🇲
i think everyone deserves a second chance
Wish we could see the like to dislike ratio tho
Everyone has their flaws. Some of you verbal individuals have done people worse behind closed doors. So unless you're willing to broadcast your wrongdoings to thousands of people. And then have to apologize? I suggest you tone the negativity down. An simply listen to the man. This isn't easy for him whatsoever. I understand he did wrong but geez some of the comments are way off like.. Really unnecessary. As of right now I'm not on anyone's side I'm just eyes and ears. I wish both of these talented souls the best 🌟
Although I'm likely unable to gauge the popularity of my sentiment, and my thought was not formed without a mixture of conflicting feelings, I'm hopeful this video fosters constructive conversation and progressive dialog.
Bro is like 4 months late lmao
A lot of bad comments here. It's not that online comments will do you better. You are human, humans make mistakes it is what you do after a mistake that matters. I think this is a good first step! Good luck on gettong back on track, you are one of the best actors imo.
Will Smith, a human being...we ALL make mistakes bro. Good to see you back man
5 months later is too little too late, this should have been done as soon as possible.
We forgive you Will and we hope that Chris forgives you too
Well said... in a deep way. I think the points made, in telling how he feels about himself, is what’s not to be taken lightly. Will feels like a P.O.S. and is probably a lifelong battle. I think from a hole that cane from an absent father. Same hole, might be why he needs his people approval and hates to let them down. So much so, that the shame from that, is unbearable.   We all make mistakes. Some are regretful, with unimaginable weight. Facing those consequences isn’t easy.   That took a lot a strength and humility, and admirable courage, in an honorable way.   Anyone unwilling to open the door, in forgiving this mistake, must have amazing views in that glass house.  I hope the best... in your moving through this Kind Sir.
Soooo 4 months later, I’m sorry.  Feels genuine
This better be on the next Youtube Rewind!
People see what they want to see. Most people came into this video looking for a Will that's not sorry and they will leave seeing a Will that's not sorry, regardless of whether Will is in fact sorry or not.   I just appreciate that he finally said something.
Will is genuinely a nice guy. There are so many amazing people out there that have made stupid mistakes like this. Obviously the gravity of this situation is a lot more, but i truly don't believe Will is a bad person. It comes down to whether Chris will accept his apology but I personally wont drag Will for this. I believe both Chris and Will should be able to move on and whether or not they stay connected or "friends" is entirely up to Chris.
glass table talk...
honestly bro is just in love with a crazy, manipulative woman, and eveything bad happening to him stems from her, I have sympathy for him only on that note.
89k likes to 133k dislikes
Why do u need different angles 😂😂😂 like it’s a reality tv show
131k dislikes. GOD DAMN. and that is after youtube disabled people from seeing them without the extension which makes people dislike a lot less. What would it be if they didn't do such a stupid thing.
What do the five fingers say to the face?
parem de atacar meu homem ok
You've let Uncle Phil down, Will.
Exactly 4 months - almost to the day he disappeared. Sorry, seems extremely calculated to me. He saw his future films tanking and his career ending. I don’t find this to be sincere.
meh it didn't seem sincere
Hes definitely not off the hook on this
YouTube should show the dislike count just for this video please. I can pay extra for this premium feature!
Still my favorite actor, still a fan of your work! As a human who mades mistakes too. 🫡
People are soooo judgmental but want grace when they mess up. And it’s always your own people. GTFOH. Bel Air Season 2!!!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽❤️
I had already unsubscribe to everything that has to with u Mr Will,but after watching this am at peace with u now,well done.😍🥰🥰
Like-Dislike Ratio(Actually, using the browser plugin):  As of Jul 29, its 89K likes, 130k dislikes
Will thought he can act a fool and still be forgiven! Money cannot buy everything! Your apologies almost real, just like you! You’re almost real! Devil is lie
ITS REWIND TIME
Non sense.
For those who can't see the dislikes, currently has 89K likes, 130K dislikes.
Took him 4 months to get production for this apology 🤣
A strong woman can destroy a strong man
Dog it’s been 4 months literally nobody cares anymore
The amount of people mocking him for this apology video is disgusting. A man has to do what he has to do in order to save his career, but can we take a moment and consider that Will may actually regret what he did and did not only post this to save himself? I honestly think he's being honest here and people are just USED to hating on apology videos. Compared to others  (Travis Scott, Logan Paul-) this is not SO bad and I could see why Will would be truly sorry for his actions. And I think he is. His personal life isn't so good either and even if it's been 4 months, I personally appreciate he took the courage to post this video.
I’ll forgive you when Chris does
130k dislikes... run it up some more
Did all this for a thot
Who  the hell cares, honestly....
Rename to "My ego apologies"
I think we should stop giving him such a hard time I mean he's clearly not doing well mentally
I missed you Will❤
I would say it’s been a couples years since you were born
Yeah that's great and all, but can we alk about the socio-economical state of the world?
Use me as dislike button
im done at his sons water bottle being promoted
logan paul's apology video for the forest controversy is better than this...
Sorry will we are humans and we must act our wills. I would have done the same thing. Good apologies video. You are legend
It took him four months to make this?!?! His PR team must not be getting paid well

finally an actually decent apology lol

CLM ✊stay strong brother
Will, I have always loved your talents and your personality. Truth is, we all make mistakes. We are human. Your mistake has been publicized while most of us have far more privacy. Keep your head up and continue doing the internal work that is necessary to heal. ❤️
lol
I wish WIll Smith widened his role range because i am kinda tired that he's always playing nice dudes. I think it could influence his mind state in everyday life because it's hard to appear good all the time. Get down to earth, nigga.
They were both in the wrong well just have to see when Chris is ready to forgive will cuz will is obviously ready to forgive him
That deserves respect bro. I’m sure Chris will have that sit down with you soon enough
I just don't understand how come all his stuff has to be so perfectly scripted? You don't have to have all the professional lighting and camera men and credits and props to apologize. He could have just did a quick face time video . It seems that he tries to make his world perfect. WILL, JUST ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE HUMAN FOR ONCE MAN, STOP BEING SO SCRIPTED  AND PERFECT. JUST KEEP IT HUMAN.
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. “Go and sin no more”-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you…because He loves you.
A GREAT PORTION of your fans and People STILL LOVE you Will! 💚
It’s okay Will
Man, you guys are hardcore. Why can’t people apologize and be sincere about it? People make mistakes
I've been reading the comments that say this is staged and rehearsed, etc. I think if we have been following Will for a while, not just him in movies, but him as a person, but his family, his activity, the many moments he's been vulnerable, we know that processing things is not linear. Personally, i belive this can be rehearsed and still be a heartfelt apology. I believe it's a heartfelt, sincere authentic apology.
Will is finished in Hollywood for a long long time.
LOL CRINGE
The best of us make mistakes. Ppl in comments lashing out on Will, I think u guys are the epitome of perfection which is why u r lashing out. Will was very wrong but its not up to us to forgive him or b!tch about him. It's Chris's call totally. Peace to u man. Ultimate peace is waiting for u coz theres been too much chaos already.
Im sorry but 3 camera angles and perfect lighting? This is some pretty good quality content for an "apology video." Sorry it just doesn't seem sincere.
Everybody makes mistakes. I wish people would take a second to think about when you did something wrong and how much you regretted it. Judging is easy, but you have to understand that there are times in life when we make a mistake and we cannot go back to solve it and no matter how much we regret it. I think we have all been in this situation on one time. Nobody can we qualify someone for one single action, we have to look back and see all the good he have done. Because otherwise we are telling the world that no matter how much good you do, because the day you stumble you will be damned.  I don't know the reasons why Will has done this and I am not going to judge him because I am nobody to do it, I only know for sure that he is a human being like everyone else and that there are situations that is too much for us. (my english is not perfect, but i tried)  A big hug Will <3
Oh, an indirect public apology. These types of apologise are always about public image rather than an actual sincere expression of remorse. If he really wanted to apologise he'd apologise directly to Chris and everyone else he just mentioned. Not buying this BS at all.
We stand by you king #CLM ✊🍋
Another YouTube fake apology 🦶
なぜクリスは一方的に被害者面しているのか。言葉の暴力は何をしても許されるのか？今のアメリカの極端すぎる考え方は他のことも含め100%理解できない。頭おかしい。
Ironic that there is a "The world is sick; love is the cure" poster behind him. The smith family seems to be the type of family that sits there and preaches these hollow virtues, and then, when it comes time to put these ideas into practice, they literally do the exact opposite. Infuriating.
If Will didn’t get all the backlash from everyone he probably wouldn’t even be apologising
You're cool with me man. You made a mistake, it happens. Up beside all the good you've done and all the joy you've brought us, I forgot about this forever ago 😆 Big Willie Style forever 💙
The Pursuit To Happiness. I use to watch that movie all this time thinking the part you played was actually somebody you where deep down. But after seeing how you made this bullshit ideal of apology that will never be a reality into the mass's eyes nor mine. Stop speaking start acting and no edits just raw footage!! No more faces and characters Will. Just You man! Goodluck!
Imagine destroying a professional relation and a decade long friendship over a woman that sleeps with other men. R.I.P to Will Smiths Career I won’t be watching nothing with him in it.
all this over a meme LMAOO
Whatever, dude. Get effed. You have more money than any of us will ever see. Stop. Go live your own life.
Fake apology it's nothing but a PR stunt
You only apologize after the backlash so it doesn’t feel genuine.
Poor Will, was fogged out and all fuzzy for four months 😂 Couldn't apologise the next day or anything.
Will did the Free Mason hand symbol "the hidden hand" so stop trying to protect "yo" brand
Why does it seem like he's reading from a teleprompter
People mess up, it's what you do next that matters! This is opportunity to self evaluate, reflect, and repair. We are all just students in life, lets lead with love hate is heavy❣️
Could we get a 'why'? We want to know really your thought process.
Willard Please For The Love Of God....STOP APOLOGIZING TO EVERY GOT DAMNED BODY!!!!!
He made a terrible mistake in a fit of anger. He should have acknowledged it as soon as it happened. Even though this may be a PR enabled apology, at least he is addressing the issue and apologising which is the only thing he can do. We don't know how he really feels. All we can hope is that this problem gets resolved and he just gets past it.
There is No complexity in striking someone. Narcissist! Scapegoater 🙄
For those wondering it is 90k - 140k rn

I STILL think it looked fake.
Well done will, book closed, time to move on, have a beer and pick up where we left it. Great stuff you did not read a PR statement and spoke from the heart. Now, can we pls get back to normal life and have a beer
and I oop-….
I still can't believe you thought you had the right to pull something like that. You celebrities really need a reality check.
This shidd staged niqqah gtta b reading on card notes😂😂😂
Who cares will, I don’t. You messed up and I think everyone needs to get over it
This is as insincere as apologies get...
Will is human and all can be emotional and impulsive.   Nobody should be judging.
Where are these questions from? Did he write his own questions to answer to? Lol
Everybody deserves forgiveness. Time will tell if he's sincere but for now, I'm giving the brother the benefit of the doubt.
YOU PASSED THE BAR??
stop apologizing your good with all of us, welcome back big homie
Don't give a damn about any of these "famous" people
It's alright, it was an action and it can be mended, the way out is making sure the future is as bright as it can be for others
I am similar to you. I am nice until I flip all the way out because people get used to trying you. Unfortunately, the wrong person might catch that wrath. I hope you both can be friends over time. Peace to you all.
You are not a piece of shyt!!! You are human. What you have expressed is all anyone can ask of you!!  It was a bad mistake. But really not the end of the world. I still respect you! I still watch anything you have been in. You cannot beat yourself up too long about letting others amd yourself down!! Continue to be the funny, respectful, great actor and person we have always known you to be. Because, many of us have had moments like this in out lives. We just weren't unlucky enough at the time to be on such a large platform. Things happen when they happen!! You are still loved by many. Others will come around!!! God bless you amd your family!!!
Use me as dislike button. As the dislike is hidden
I hope he doesn't forgive you it was  messed up what you did I did look up to u I adored you not anymore!
i liked the speech from hancock better...
All the hate comments 🤣.
What you should do is get a divorce… Just saying…
He's wishing he had that Men In Black memory neutalyzer pen!!
Thumbs down
This man is not sorry one bit, he does not regret anything of what he did, he does not even have the balls to say what he really thinks and feels... He is just regretting the repercussions of his actions, and how it affects him. This apology is fake, and it is a coward's apology.
Will Smith my guy
It took will smith 4 months to make this.
will we forgive you. people make mistakes ur still an icon
Salir a pedir disculpas en redes para que el mundo trate de aceptar y comprender su vergonzoso actuar, no esta bien. Nada justifica su proceder y menos tratando de ser el macho que le exigen que sea, estan destruyendo su vida y lo han sabido lograr en distintas oportunidades quebrantando su espíritu y su esencia. Lamento que a un ser humano de su talla lo este corrompiendo un enano lleno de envidia, caprichoso y necesitado de atención. Es usted libre de escoger su camino, pero no permita que en nombre del amor, de una union o de ninguna promesa; su vida sea mancillada y su carácter deformado. Bendiciones.
CLM
I forgive u . I don't know about others
IS Jada's boyfriend cool with you using the back room?
Just start making good movies and people will forget this ever happened
yeah very complex moment good thing he didn't unpack all of it right now that would have taken forever
I just stop listening at a point, I couldn't even deduce anything from the whole video
And That’s How We Do It...
not changes anything, you showed your true self and i dont like it. your Son said "thats how we do it" and i think this appology is just a farce to save your image.
Not that it matters...but for the record, I never stopped being your friend ❤
Damn this is the apology video. I was pologied watching this video. The apology video of the year.

You just seem angry still, dude. You must really want that useless trophy, y’all covet so much in tinsel town. Thought you were a better actor than that.
You're not wrong. I wouldn't want to be played with my weakest part. I love you buddy.❤🇧🇷
how many dislikes does this have
The people who blame Will for waiting 4 months never had to make a public apology.  And I advise Chris to forgive him, because who has never sinned ? The one who likes to be forgiven must also forgive.
I have never seen a more staged apology.   He's missing the $$$$$.
You sure looked fine with it during your acceptable speak when you stood on that soap box in-front of everyone
🤦🏼‍♀️
It’s cause when ur in a toxic relationship effects ur mental health
This thing is so PRODUCED, man.... Once you see that it's hard to buy into it as being genuine. He shoulda gone with raw cell phone cam confession rather than six different camera angles 🥴
Will Smith is human just like the rest of us and he made a mistake. He should apologize whenever he feels like he's ready. Not because of internet pressure. If Chris accepts his apology (which I'm sure he will) then that's his decision to make and we should be supportive towards 2 of our most prominent black entertainers coming together and pushing the narrative of positivity
✊🍋 #CLM
hey guys its currently 88K likes to 128k dislikes
Hope ya all doing great 😇😇
It’s takes a real man to apologize for something he did 4 months ago after he got backlash lol.
Apologizing to public is not your answer. No one will come knocking your door to hear your apology, sitting in ur room making apologies video makes u more unprofessional, it's clear that you are trying to recover the fame you lose 🥺🥺
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮💀💀💀
This is one of Will's finest  jobs for the whole word to see for free.  Full circle with full sincerity.
Oh please.
Dear Will, you bring us joy and you are a great example for how you are behaving. We all make mistakes. Tons of love from Spain and big hug, brother 💞
Will if your really sorry, then donate $20M to a charity of that Chris supports.
Little late bud
Why now

This guy trying to get back in the academy with this performance?
I'm still here missed you will hope all is well and that things can get back to normal and move on and enjoy the movies again still my favorite actor and hope to see more projects soon much love
An apology video turned into a Q&A video. I guess Will has nothing to apologize, but trying to make it so the public will forgive him... It seems like its not working
This took bravery and honesty. I think this video was more for Chris and the people he hurt than it was for us. Screw what we think like we said he's only human the only thing we know of Will is what we've been exposed to but at the end of the day us humans all suffer the curse of emotion.
This should've been made days after, not months after, lol. Now it seems like blowing it out of proportion. The world has moved on.
Lol
This actually isn’t that bad of an apology video, nice job Will.
Ever since that moment, I thought it was a stunt. A publicity stunt. Now that I see  this video. It was actually for real?
Will smith has an apology video? He is officially a youtber!
You're only apologizing because it hurt your image.  I, for one, don't believe you.
No actual comedians were harmed during the production of this motion picture.
This guy makes The Pursuit of Happiness unwatchable
well..Idk what Chris will said but im with Chris with whatever his decisions it maybe...
🤣🤣🤣
I'm giving the man a break. I like what he said and how he said it. I know I've done a few things nearly or as bad and I learned from it and grew from it. Hopefully Will will also.
88k Likes. I guess people accepted this apology now. Thanks, YouTube
Will smith is an official YouTuber now lol
This is hilarious LMAO 🤣
humiliation ritual?
You don’t get forgiveness  from strangers and fans. They have 0 power here and 0 authority. Only the ones affected get the right to forgive you. But you need to fix the problems and you know what they are and WHO they are.
Lol
88k likes and 127k dislikes for anyone interested.
Still love you though. 😌
88k likes and 127k dislikes says it all lol

You are not forgiven lmfao you’ve had basically no repercussions
You turned this against Chris by saying he avoids you? I wonder why. You apologize to your kids? The same kids that were tweeting proudly "that's how we do it"? We know that all your family is messed up and this is just a PR attempt to pull back lost fans.
Will needs Jesus. I'm sure his grandmother would've said the same thing.
Is it just me or would it not have been better to privately apologise to Chris when he is ready instead of this obvious over produced ‘public’ apology wHich is blatantly just PR damage control
Bs apology
Why don't you replay the moments with Epstein
👍
Now I'm just waiting for Vladimir Putin apologize video and there will be finally peace in the world : )
A little late dude, this reeks strongly of "I can't land a role anymore and I can't afford this lifestyle any longer"
One thing I did not like was Mr. Smith did not apologize to the Williams family this was a very meaningful night in the lives of this family as well as very great Tennis Champions.
He release an apology video like this when Beyonce drops an album: disrespectful.
We are all on journeys of discovery and we all make mistakes along the way. Best of luck to Will and his family and Chris and his family on theirs
You’re a legend will. Keep being the light this world needs. We’re all human and do things we’re not proud of. You learn and you grow. Much love to you 💙
Trying to save your career??? I used to be a big fan of Will Smith but honestly, not anymore. Whether you had apologized or not, sadly the damage already done and for some reason I can't look at Will Smith the same way I did
So when are we going to see G.I.JANE 2?
But the product impressment is brilliant lol
We all realize this is Jada's fault, right?
Sorry but three cameras are not enough. You need some motion dude, maybe a crane or a dolly plus a couple of lights to create a more dramatic look. I am not an expert though.
Still can’t say, “I’m sorry” to Chris. Dude is not sorry 😂
A good ole’ fashioned You Tube apology 🤦🏻‍♀️
That was your moment though, everyone and anyone who tuned in that day was there for you and not anyone else
publicists in the homelander universe would be having a heart attack right now.
She is everyone's "babe"🙄

He doesn’t feel on script. He doesn’t feel likes he’s acting. Just feels like a dude who felt he needed to address it and was figuring out how to do that. I respect the effort
This is your best performance yet!
Still waiting for the apology for Shark Tale
CLM WE STAND WITH EMONEY  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO emoney7
If will wants to say sorry send the man a check equivalent to him sueing you.
What a perfect parody of apology
Whenever Chris and Will can sit down on ABC or CNN or NBC and do a sit down interview it will be the most viewed interview of all times. It will be over 50million views.
This man can entertain us all by himself even in an interview ❤️🤯
I there wasnt any backlash he wouldnt have apologized. He is sorry that he got called out and that his career is dying. He didnt apologize to Chris in his speech because he didnt know how it was going to play out.
I feel like Will still owes us all another one of these apology videos for Wild Wild West!
I still don't see what the big deal is? I didn't have a problem with what you did, people get beat down for less than that around here. You just did what a lot of people have wanted to do over the years, maybe next time don't do it on tv is my only advice. Everyone nowadays gets butt hurt if the wind blows the wrong direction.
The only thing missing is a dog
It doesn't seem real, it looks like you were told what to do to keep the coolness going, but real people forgive and don't leave hatred 💛💛
I still DIDN’T hear “I’m Sorry Chris.”
Throughout life people will make you mad Disrespect you and treat you bad Let God deal with the things they do 'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
WILL WE FORGIVE YOU, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINIONS #CLM ✊
🥺🥺
Absolutely not, no way. You and Chris can not be friends again. No way
It's been a minute...since this video started and I can already tell that this is gonna be one of THOSE apology videos.
Ever since he lost that dog everything’s been a crazy ride.
All these comments.. Yet, I gotta say this seems like a pretty good apology video. I forgive you Will. I hope Chris and the rest of the community does too. It’s pretty hard to come back from something of this caliber; however, if anyone can do it, it’s Will.   Notice he doesn’t make this all about him and what he’s going through. He acknowledged more about how others felt and were affected, over how he felt.   Seems like a pretty good apology to me, he seems to understand just how fast you can lose a lot.

The boondocks predicted this exact moment
Will you are loved ♥. Thank you for being so transparent and accepting responsibility for a mistake. You got this.
bro took 4 months to make and apology and... tbh it isn't that bad not great but ain't horrible
Beautiful set nicely written, good choreography and very well directed. It is an example of good screenplay. Are you reading all this on a teleprompter?
I believe his words to be genuine and true and look forward to Will rebuilding his reputation and continue to put out great movies.  We all make mistakes.... so let's forgive and move on.
Hahahahaha!!!!!!!!
It seems like he’s playing that character from that movie where he’s all depressed and the shareholders can’t do anything without him
L + Ratio
He says everything is fuzzy…but then talks about how he was “replaying and understanding” that moment. 🙄 Yeah ok.
Sort it like men with the Tortilla Challenge
Too but we can’t see the dislike count.
WILL DOES  NOT HAVE To apologize YOU  ONLY CHRIS SMH
Nice sigh. Perfect cinematic opening.
Blablabla.
do not hire this crazy guy !! will smith is crazy!
Red table talk and music careers tanking=Will release another apology video
Am I the only one being targeted by the Will Smith book ad alongside this video? It's kinda sleazy, no?
Has-been celebrity desperately trying to stay relevant in the age of influencers.
Love you Will.  We all make mistakes.  Lord knows I have. We are all human.  I can't wait to see you entertain us again.
Should have  brought his dog
A great man torn down by awful controlling woman. Story old as time
I read Will’s book and totally see where he was coming from at that moment and now. Will, I feel you meant every word in this explanation/apology. Eloquently said.
Mr. Will Smith, I respect you doing this and do hope you and Chris can patch things up, it was a bad moment and you're only human. Much love y'all.
I love you will it’ll all be alright man
Even though it was a little late, I appreciate Will taking this on and apologizing to not just Chris but to his family and the nuances of his actions. Nicely done.

You know an apology is legit when it comes months after the event.
You are back, that's all that matters. You've never let me down Sir. Even after watching wild wild west you didn't let me down. We are all human. I'm unhappy this test and burden came upon your shoulders but I'm not worried because I'm positive you will rise from the mud and come out better and brighter like the lotus you are and have always been. Peace Sir.
For people that can't see the dislikes: There is 125k dislikes
Your walked up just quit
Will never even said “I’m sorry Chris” He only said “I apologize” which is bs. Will Smith is a great example of why you should never idolize celebrities.
This is obviously BS and evident from the gate with a lie. Very first thing out of his mouth.  But he didn’t apologize to Chris because it was foggy. How about saying you were drunk? Or how about saying you didn’t want to apologize to him? How about being truthful for once?
How are you going to be remorseful without being ashamed?  You should be ashamed that you did something wrong.  For you NOT to feel ashamed means that you really don't hold yourself accountable for your actions, because there is always that 'but'.  'I'm sorry BUT he deserved it" "I'm sorry BUT I'm going through something".  You aren't owning up to anything.  Like people are saying below, this is definitely the definition of a YouTube apology (smh)
don't let this distract you from the fact that her daughter Willow Smith is a great vocalist and talented singer.
It takes time to sincerely apologize to understand what you are apologizing for this was a lesson that you had to grow from sounds like you're in the right direction I'm owed several apologies in my past but not one person that crossed me ever acknowledge they owed me one this was good Will good for your heart and soul
W Will
It was good to see you again.  We are all human. I'm still a fan and we'll see you on the other side of this issue.  ❤️❤️
There’s a lot of product placement, feels like a PR stunt(!!)
Proud of you, Big Man. Praying for ya.   You’re the only one that can do the work. You’re the only one that has to sleep with yourself, and I hope you can find some peace and build something positive out of a terrible situation. Good luck, and don’t forget that you are still the same leader you’ve always been.  I hope everyone can learn something wonderful from all of this.
I can’t believe this is the final result after 4 months of practice
This is what is happening when your ego become too BIG.
87K Likes vs 124k Dislikes...interesting, yes?
We are all human and we all make mistakes.One mistake should not define a person's life. Smith has paid a huge price already for his mistake. I hope Chris finds a place in his heart to forgive soon.   However, whether Chris forgives or not. Will must now move on with his life and continue to grow to become a better person. He must not build his future life on Chris's forgiveness because it may or may not come. I wish both of them the best in their future endeavours. May one moment of weakness never define our lives.
Fake apology! You don’t regret it at all!
Ye without sin cast the first stone!! God forgives you and so do I, my prayers are with you ,chris and both families ❤ you have forgive yourself!
Let's be real here, he's not apologizing for what he did. He's apologizing that it was publicly aired and everyone saw it; I get that will doesn't have the best life right now, but he's still in control of his own actions. As of right now I don't think anyone here has the right to forgive him, Chris does. As it stands though I don't forgive him for making a mockery of himself in front of the world, he shouldnt lose control or act that way because of his woman.
We are human, we make mistakes. It's all good Will, time to move on from this. Thank you Will. #CLM 🍋✊️
I am sure this video show the good exemple.

chris deserved it
I can't believe people are still on him over this. When have you ever heard anything negative about Will Smith in 30 years of being an A list celebrity? The man makes ONE mistake and you still hate him this much? Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you people? Have some compassion and just sanity.
Love both Chris and Will! Hope Chris and Will talk it out
I like how Charlie's video has more views, and likes. In about the same amount of time being out.

This dude is so out of touch with reality.
Weird video, feels like it’s so scripted, like a hostage video. Didn’t feel sincere, if he felt bad he’d just let if flow and talk…. such a big scripted production… the way it ended? All bizarre.

"Achoo ! 🤧 Sorry bout that,  Am allergic to BS " -
That’s what anger management classes are for. In the heat of the moment you just get pissed and do stupid things but on that you didn’t apologize during your acceptance speech because you were still so freaking angry. Don’t say that your brain was fuzzy. Your payment have been fussy because you were angry. It is not OK to play the victim card when you are the aggressior. It’s very stand up for you to post an apology but it’s not very much manning up and owning anything  I tried so hard to teach my kids to have ownership of their crap without excuses or justification and when public figures don’t do that it’s quite disappointing. Geez. I hope that you and Chris are both able to move on with each of your lives and be successful and role model good things for your families.
You gotta speak to Chris bout this man not us
CLM ✊
Chris needs to decline this with a youtube short "it's been 4 months"
One day at a time.
Thank you, Will, for taking the right steps. I'm willing to forgive, but it's not me you hurt. I just hope Chris reaches out.
Nice damage control, only took 4 months.

Not his best acting scene.  Just don't see a genuine repentance here. Sorry will I hope you find another way to apologize  to Chris. It feels like you are just trying to get people to love you " worshp" you again.
Fakest apology I’ve ever seen. Just go away
I was recently going through a rough phase of depression... My parents died in a plane crash a few months back which f****** destroyed me, my dog  died a week ago and now I was diagnosed with schizophrenia just earlier today. I thought my life was over man...  But you, Will, you gave me the strength to keep on going, I haven't felt so happy in months man. I want to say thank you for everything you did for us, from the bottom of my heart, thank you! You saved my life!  #CLM #istandwithwill #wewillnotbesilenced 🍋✊️

Least he left the comments on. Gonna be brutal when he reads them.
Thanks*
nah
Chris ain't having it.
Took him 4 months to realize he wasn't gonna get away with it. This aint an appology, this is damage control.
Y’all as a family probably need to be humbled. Your son co-signing what you did just ridiculous
You can tell he is trying so hard to make a perfectly P.C speech. So many pauses trying to find the right words. Just speak from the damn heart. This isn't an apology.
papa
The lighting, multiple camera angles, rehearsal, and editing underscore Smith's sincerity.
Us, viewers, we don't have rights to forgive him. Only Chris can, no one else
I’m still on your side Will.
Great video. He should post a Rocky style training montage leading up to this apology.
Real Gangsta
That woman is the worst thing that’s ever happened to Will Smith. Whether he knows it or not.

Apologising then going into his traumas for some classic pity-baiting, modeling his clothing brand and his son's water bottle brand, panning cameras in an apology video. Man, Will Smith is a real weird dude, all that stuff makes this video stink of being disingenuous.
i don't understand why all the hate to you. you're the king, i love you <333
Will I lost all respect for you and your body of work there is no coming back from certain situations
I stand with Will! #CLM #wewillnotbesilenced 🍋✊️
I love you 💟
Oh no he didn't put his son's water brand on the table.... seriously!!
ok
Hay gente que han hecho peores cosas en Hollywood y Will Smith tiene que pedir perdón por una puta bofetada, nada tío me bajo
He's not ready to have that conversation but you force the issue into the public because you feel you need to. Like seriously, he doesn't want to talk to about it right now, so you bring millions of people into this...do you not think the attention will come back to him when he already said "HE'S NOT READY?"  This was a clueless and clearly an "all about me" move. In other words, you aren't sorry and you haven't learned.
will smith is speedrunning the any% record of ruining one's career and reputation
It’s been a minute but life is about today. Chris has already forgiven you. Starting forgiving yourself.
Why was this recommended to me lol I do not care
Let me promote my son's drink and my clothes brand in an apology video.  Lost all respect for this man.
I think the relationship with Chris and his family is OVER. Making a video 4 months later, and then saying you're hurt....all I see is an entitled, narcissistic and angry person. I wish we all could see the like to dislike ratio....or how long it takes for comments to be disabled.
One of the best apology videos I've seen on here. So proud of you Will. Let them hate, they will never understand. #CLM #wewillnotbesilenced 🍋✊️
As a fellow man who is only happy when their girl is happy, I support you in everything you do will. 🍋✊just know Will that if all these losers in your comments aren’t standing with you, the CLM movement will always have your back.
Isn't Wario's cap supposed to be yellow? Wtf?
Just forgive yourself and move on. It's Hollywood you know.
Sometimes you don't need forgiveness... sometimes you need to experience the full force of consequences to become better. I don't think forgiveness helps in this situation
dude why did you go to make this apology only 4 months? and you even advertised your watermark if you don't like to disappoint people because you made this video I say this as a look from a fan not as a hater.
He's getting paid big for this apology.
an apology isn’t enough, we demand blood
Will you seek anger management help?
This apology is for your career which should be over.  Apologize in private to Chris in private like a man.
To me, i think the biggest thing is can you forgive yourself Will? Eventually chris and all your fan will probably forgive you, but can you forgive yourself. Goodluck to you my man.
Been a minute?! You should stay gone a bit longer🤣🤣
#CLM thank you Will. This was amazing.
Doing this publicly when he doesnt want to speak with you yet is just as bad as what you did. So here you are publicly trying to shame him. This is low. You are not who I thought you were :(
Sounds good to me
'Cut! Will...act with a bit more humility please. Okay take two....and...action...' -' blah blah apologies blah reached out blah blah i shall wait to recieve him at my leisure blah. Wait..what does humility mean?'
He even started with the classic "youtube sigh" before beginning. 😂😂 "it's all fuzzy" 😂😂😂😂 I'm done.  Always the people obsessed with an image of "peace, love and light" that are narcissistic asf
Support the movement! #CLM
Will, I have been a fan of yours since I was a kid watching fresh prince.   You made a mistake, and have paid for it. You have been a man about how you handled the aftermath of your mistake.   Nobody is perfect, but you still have my respect.
Big simpin wills not pimpin
Dear Mr. Smith, you don't have to apologize. You stood up for the honor of your spouse and now you are being bullied because of broken standards of norms and morals. The whole of Russia supports you. I wish you success and happiness. Don't give up!
So much product placement in this video 😂 but he apologized still right? 🤣

I’m honest I’m honest… I’m ghonedt im honest bro I’m honest,… honest… I’m honest. Yeah I’m honest
#CLM ✊
But make it look good for youtube.
The smiling and giggles just made it less authentic.
🤡
Man , So much of my childhood involved listening to Wills music and watching him on tv and the movies . I hope this is sincere . Hope he’s ok and can mend things will Chris .
This is so crazy bc my gf and her friends were like omg that’s how a man is supposed to act lol like huh yea big ole baby can’t control his emotions especially on live tv
You're the GOAT! I stand with Will! #CLM ✊️
Meh. Even if he was apologized behind camera, if it was sincere and convincing and memorable enough, I'm sure Chris would've told everyone on any media available.
Black Radio they don't play me tho
Will smith I salute you brother FLY HIGH!! OVER FLOWING ABUNDANCE FOREVER!!
That lamp has that shape for a reason    :/
Takes a strong man to apologize,  I will always be a fan Will.  We are all human, our anger sometimes gets the better of us regardless of the fact you are a big actor or just a regular guy not being watched by thousands.   I just pray your doing better, so glad you made this video!
Lmaoo
Mike tyson bit a ear off! Please ..will smith image is Extraordinary! People show up to see you fall not ball!! People are feeding off this.. NEW LEVEL NEW DEVIL!!!!  WHEN YOUR DOING THE MOST PEOPLE NEED ANYTHING ON YOU TO EQUATE WITH  Misery they experience on a day to day... they need you eye to eye with them... I took a female to paris who wasn't use to ANYTHING like that...in the hotel I had to do number 2 while she was laying on the bed..once I was done she walked in and took a deep breath and said I wanted to see what your sh!t smelled like..TRUST!! THE BIGGER YOU BECOME THE BIGGER THE TARGET BECOME
Proud of you brother  🍋 ✊ #CLM
Been a long overdue min, u should have apologized that night
Already canceled
stop promoting your son's water!!! you guys have no shame....
Will Smith is our real life hero 😎
Sometimes... Sometimes, muddy water is best cleared by just leaving it alone
Unfortunately the least authentic part of this video is the apology to Chris. Which sadly IMO voids everything else said… If you are still mad at Chris say so, be real.
I'm crying rn, thank you Will #CLM
Si bien la acción no fue la correcta, sería bueno preguntarle a cualquier hijo, esposo o padre cómo reaccionaria ante un hombre que se burla de tu esposa en tu cara, o de un hijo?. Seguro que no lo golpearían?.. A Will se le juzga por su acciones y se máxima todo por ser una figura pública, pero a la gente se le olvida que antes de ser el WILL SMITH que todos vemos en la pantalla, es también un ser humano, que tiene sentimientos, que se enoja, que se frustra y que tampoco es perfecto, como nadie en el mundo lo es.  Antes de criticar y querer crucificar a Will por una acción que está claro que no fue correcta, véanse antes al espejo y preguntense si ustedes son perfectos, cómo reaccionarian ante una acción similar?..  Diría un viejo dicho, quién esté libre de pecado que arroje la primera piedra.  Will eres un gran actor y un gran ser humano, imperfecto cómo todos los humanos, pero con la capacidad de reconocer tus errores y enmendarlos, ojalá que sigas dentro del cine por muchísimos años, y encuentres la paz interior y tu estabilidad emocional, que al final todos merecemos ser felices. Busca quien te de el valor que te mereces y quién sea capaz de dar todo por ti, cómo tú lo haz hecho por los tuyos.  Éxito en todo, y bendiciones.
How many girlfriends do you have?  👀 Want another? 🤣🤣🤣 Jk
You are so brave, thank you Will. #CLM
Don't believe you.
okay
Will is that level of famous it f_ks up the head weirdo level famous... so out of touch.. man doesn't even know who he is himself
Dint know you have a Youtube channel. I admire you a lot! To make mistakes is normal but to apologise and try to solve it is wonderful and heroes job. Wish you the best now and forever!
PR stunt
Kids these days so soft. He just slaped him all the "juctice kids" are like "how dare you?!"
Love you, glad you are back!
Was a huge fan, now completely over him. I find him highly manipulative. Everything seems super calculated and thought out. He cares deeply about how his is perceived and tries to control that narrative. Like his phony laugh, what's up with that?  I actually thought this way for years, but ignored it because I was a fan. Now, that's all I see. Phoniness. Manipulation. I won't even watch Season 2 of Bel Air. Lost all respect for him.
we Will not be silenced! #CLM
Will Smith insulted and damaged the public image of Every Single Black Man in America.  He stooped to his lowest level and reacted in a manner that reinforces every single Stereotype people make about "those people".  He owes the Entire African American Community an Apology.
might be just me, but i apologize to the person, not make it a public thing. should focus on making it right with chris, not making sure that your fans still accept you
Praying for u brudda
Will smith do have played among us
Too little too late.  Too constructed and contrived.  You’re selling your$30 book below the apology.  You need to do more.
why are people so unforgiving, wills been mostly clean from doing anything bad for like 30 years now and he does one bad thing and half of you just instantly dislike him, it’s honestly baffling. You can lose your entire reputation in a minute, the internet sucks sometimes
Oh my
This apology was a real knockout
Let Chris get his lick back!
okay anyway, anyone want to play tf2 with me
I believe in forgiveness but I honestly feel this is only because he is losing his empire. I believe that he is sorry for what he did but I also believe he is trying to save his career. This shouldn't be on social media you should just meet up privately and not advertise this anymore than it already has. attitude reflect leadership God is Good and God is all about forgiveness. I was upset deeply by your actions because I felt that you were an amazing role model for all. I turned my back on you and your movies and to be honest that was wrong on my part. I appreciate the apology to your fans and I personally forgive you and ready to move forward. God Bless You Will stay Strong. Just remember Will ......"When your right and your rude then your wrong".
After that night,I couldn’t even enjoy Joyner’s Will song no more
People are generally stupid for the idea of worshipping these so called celebrities. Find happiness within your own lives no matter how insignificant you feel.
This is all just madness. Just madness lol.
Actions can rewrite a legacy but an apology never will
Little girl...
This is the weirdest apology I’ve ever seen
the hat, the $30 book link, no “shame”
*4 months later*  “I’m sorry”  Wow, sure.
Zammit, all he needed was the dog...
Now it's time for a Hancock sequel... Slapcock.
Chris shouldn't have made the comment period. If will wasn't famous people would be acting differently. It's ridiculous
Probably shouldn't have been promoting a $30 book while you're apologizing for acting like a fool. 🤦‍♀
YOU CAN'T SILENCE US, NO MATTER HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE! 15 YEARS, 15 MONTHS, 15 WEEKS, 15 DAYS, 15 HOURS, 15 MINUTES OR 15 SECONDS. WE WILL WIN #CLM 🍋✊
0:10-0:35 you can legitimately hear the apprehension/inflection in his voice an that's basically not possible to just make happen WillyNilly even if he is a actor...
Genuinely sounds dry tbh
Just sucks that it happened. Like even if people forgive or got over it... how do those that looked up to will smith able to see him in that same light again?  My husband and I sleep with the TV on (religiously for the past 15 years) and our 3 shows that we fall asleep to every night was either Still standing, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and The Office. We stopped watching fresh prince.. it just wasn't the same anymore.
I don’t think his home life can allow him to heal.
Wow he should think before doing it but like it said . What ever it done it done because you can't go back and fix it at all
All while advertising his sons dumb water in the background
Thank you for talking to us about this; we were all wondering about it. You are just a man, but a good one. ❤️
Dude she be ashamed of himself.. Thanks for the apology.. but damage is unrepairable at this point. Move on and get help..
i been forgave will
Are you donating the money you are making with this video?  Because you should be in Jail, just like if it was one of us.
As of right now this video as 86K Likes and 121K Dislikes.
took 4 months for this fake apology lol. He didnt say sorry to Chris, he apologized, big difference.
No one should forgive him.
Rewind time
Lost a lot of respect for you will, you’re a role model and know better than that. Millions of kids look up to you. Should’ve handled yourself better as a man.
We stand with you king! Woooo 🍋✊ CLM #CuckLivesMatter
You should have just waited after the awards ceremony instead of doing it on tv.  It made you look unhinged.  At least doing it at an afterparty wouldn't have been as bad.  It should have been one of those we ain't done or I'll see you later moments if it was so serious.  I guess Will thought nobody was watching the awards.  He was right.  I heard it on the internet like everyone else.
You're probably not reading all these comments but I would just say,  I believe strongly in redemption. Without question,  what you did in that moment was wrong and is magnified because you're a person that so many look up to. The words you're saying matter because that shows you're acknowledging the mistake you made but time and action show will show what those words true value are.  I believe you're a good person. Not a single person can say they have not let their emotions get the best of them. Whether Chris forgives you or what capacity that's at,  is completely up to him,  and that's his action to take. Whatever he chooses, he doesn't have to justify his choice.  But Will, keep your head up,  keep spreading love with action and time will be on your side.  You are not a bad person, rather simply a human.  If more people in this world took accountability for their actions,  the world would be a vastly different place and I believe you're setting a great example of that.
I feel this is a genuine apology,  but still what If the pr team suggested this and it makes sense as the movie promotion will be kickstarted soon. - just an observer
I’m glad Uncle Phil ain’t here to see this madness, Rest In Peace Uncle Phil for Reals
We still love you Will.  One bad night don't take away from the great and nice person you've always been.
Every human makes mistakes but you have take full responsibility for your mistakes and show humility.
Y si no aceptáis mi disculpa os ostio la cara
alto plancha sos ñery!
You're remorseful because you can't shake the bad image. And the title? C'mon
Actually i lost respect of will, will may have money but actually chris is the gentle man
It's okay Will, if Jada's many boyfriends forgive you then I will too
Don't apologize sometimes when a line gets crossed there are consequences favorable or not consequences of your actions are what makes you think about the disrespect your about throw to the world and make good decisions
Sorry Will - not buying it. You want to be remorseful without feeling ashamed? That means your remorse is superficial. True remorse comes with shame - that is why there is regret with our worst moments. You are NOT a horrible person but what you did WAS horrible - plain and simple. No nuance. No complexity. Owning it means acknowledging your guilt in the situation.
Not exactly a minute. It's actually been four months, will.
great furniture choice will
An apology means nothing without atonement. An apology without atoning is just for the transgressor and not for the person who the apology is for.
Forgiven by the community doesn't mean that Chris had forgiven you, so you better apologize to him instead of trying to be accepted by the community again
Frankly I don't think he should have to apologize at all.
Just leave the woman she's poison look at her stance after what happened your a legend in every you've done but she's dead weight save yourself
Yeeesh... Good on you for finally saying sorry, but 4 months? This looks more like a career recovery plea than an actual apology.  A Divorce is more cleaner than this...
It’s rewind time
Why make a apology video 4months later? much better to reach out personally,
I will be delighted to know that the families of the 2 meet (it doesn't need to be public). Because it looks like there's a deep wound that needs to be healed. Regardless of the reactions (for or against) all I remember is that it shocked me. And in my opinion the black community would really need to know that in this kind of situation it is necessary that all the clans sit down to table. Because without this process, this old energy will follow your family for generations.
Still my guy
Through the and downs 💯♥️
I hope you read this Will out of the thousands of comments, Look we all make mistakes big or small, learn from it and change. Don't bother about all the people who judge you. There is only one God who sees your true heart and judges you rightly. Become a better person make peace with Chris and move on.
Nice word salad, Will.
this seems so fake and ingenuine,  youre giving off the energry that you could explode in anger any minute
86k likes and 121k dislikes not good will not good
Looks like he’s reading a script
It takes a lot of privilege to know that you can walk onto a stage and humiliate another man or “friend” knowing there’s going to be no repercussions and after laughing and dancing the night away....this video is only being done because you have been told to do it and I’m glad Chris is THRIVING and you are not! Be greatful you didn’t end up in jail.
Should have never apologized. Now you just like wishy washy and weak.
Still love Will :)
An apology 4 months later, how brave.
let me see if people recognize me in new account 😂
Lemon ✊ CLM
Isn’t that his kids water company? Like, right there in the middle of the table? Is this a sponsored apology? Yikes.
This is really a reflection of how callous the world has become. Will smith has been the perfect Hollywood star for decades. He had an awful moment and hurt many people. But the way people are clutching their pearls, virtue signaling, and judging him is just crazy to see.
Lost me as a fan, so disappointing.
Aaaah man!  I’m  at a loss…. I commend you for taking the ‘the step forward’ to attempt and fix this.  I really do.  We are  only human. Imperfection is a part of humanity, is a part of every day life, FOR EVERYONE.   It’s our biggest obstacles and our biggest lessons and teachers in our life time.  HOWEVER. 🫣. How this video/ format/ was done doesn’t come across sincere to me.  Not that you are not… it just doesn’t come across that way. It feels like a political speech / “too Hollywood.”  Propped stage, mic, “the world is Sick , Love is the Cure.” Picture [ great on tho.  I will remember that one for future use.] 😋… and the curated questions… (pause) but….  I will not judge you for making an attempt.  At this point… that is all that is required. The rest will sort itself out in the wash.   Either way. #StayTrue #Live&Love #Live&Learn 🙏🏻
They built a filming set for his apology 🤣🤣🤣
Biggest 🤡of the world
a whole fool. foh
Bruh
“Ooh, thats hot! Thats hot.”
As long toxic people is in your life you don’t have control…
How many the dislikes now ?
that's quite a production. If an ordinary  person  did that at work they would have been sacked and prosecuted.
It looks like he's trying to read those small letters from eyesight tests
Wish the snowflakes and softies didn’t get rid of the dislike count.  Would’ve been so huge.  I blame the new ghostbusters movie. Jadas fault
Let me explain to you the nuances and complexities of that moment for you Will. You are a 53 year old baby who needs to grow up. This "apology" is obviously so staged and rehearsed, and you are simply trying to save your career.
I believe In you will. It’s never how you start it’s how you finish. We all make mistakes . Big or small. Keep having the WILL to STAND TALL !
You can tell that he is a deeply troubled human being and is grappling with some very serious mental health issues.
Lemon ✊ CLM
Great.... Now I need 6 months to let my 38 year old brother know I ate his cookie yesterday.......
wanna see chris's reply
Another crafted BS hollywood apology.   I noticed he said "sorry" to everyone else, but "I apologize" to Chris his mom and brother.  Those two words mean different things.  And far as damaging people's image of you, you are correct.   It's always been a well crafted "image", in other words FAKE. Your behavior afterward is more telling of reality.  You showed no concern for anyone but Will Smith and celebrating yourself.  Something you missed is the damage to the reputation of those that flocked around you while Chris was let there alone to do his assigned job.    Denzel, Tyler and Bradley are pieces of crap and just as culpable as you and may as well stood in line to get their respective smacks. You correct friends when they do wrong not back them up. As far as trying not to feel ashamed,  psychopaths feel no shame.
I like how toxic this comment section is and how everyone is being a fake therapist like they havent even once lost there cool in life
You don’t have to wait 4 months to apologize…
i thought this video was pretty well done why yall hating
He made a mistake, he has apologized. it's in the past. LET'S  M O V E  O N ! ! !
I feel you Will, I got into a similar situation when I disrespected my dad by yelling at him because I was mad and wasn’t thinking.
No matter what Will you're human and your reaction was based on what was happening to you at that time . The behavior was not admirable but it happened.  You have brought soo much joy and laughter in my life . Thank you . You are forgiven  .
he's good at reading
"chris,. im wrong, Im sorry" enough... create whole monologues and sighing as if he is the only person having the hardest time
Iran president also president of Israel he got to close to other nation presidents kids ewwww
I still look up to you!! it was a unfortunate moment for a fortunate human. You’re amazing! and blessed and to have that reaction it was clearly not you , just HollyWOOD provoking a bear, that’s already figuring out themselves mentally. you know who you are, we accept your apology! A true Legend
Good boy.
We still love you brother. Humans make mistakes. Time will heal the wounds. Taking ownership which you did will help expedite that process.
If only he danced like that one chick..
It wasn’t even that bad tbh
Nice level-up, Will!
Watching this makes you giggle a bit
I had a video of a client after ranking his business on the first page of google, YouTube... something different came up from his competitors
I forgive you will 🌹♥️
nonesense
Nuances and complexities? You smacked him in the face, mate. Any nuance or complexity was in your head. The situation was pretty simple. Don’t smack people.
I still respect you bro. He kinda deserved it.
no no you already earned em gangster points 😎😎 we can't take em back .....willy gansterkid from philly
…who wrote that crap???
OH WILL I my self will  forgive ur actions 💯
Finally can we move tf on and stream the fresh prince intro
Nuances and complexities. Seems pretty simple to me.  I’m out.

"I can't let it slide, I have to ratio this nigga"
If I had will Smith money I wouldn't feel the need to explain to anyone. Then again, this is will smith
yaaaah, its rewind time
I believe the lack of shame in today’s society is our major problem. Sure people can say “I shouldn’t have done that” or “I regret having done that”. It’s normal to feel shame when you let  the people you love down , your team down, the people whom you respect and those who respect you. It’s most important when, you let yourself down. It also demonstrates to others, that an individual has a moral compass. Therefore, allowing people to empathize.  Nothing wrong with being ashamed if you know you were wrong. Self reflection people, self reflection.

Please explain your speech afterwards, what was that about?
He was one of my favorite people of all time.  But now i'm COMPLETELY over him.  Because so many times it's said, "that Black people don't know how to control themselves" and he played right into that stereotype. So it's a "NO" for me.
Will, maybe just go quietly away and live a peaceful life away from all drama.
it's amazing how toxic this comments are... jesus christ
Stop it. Its too late for apologies. Just own it and walk it proudly. Dont fall to pressure from peers and the public. The only thing that matters is you knew what you did was wrong and youre fully accepting to do better moving forward.
Don’t be rude, haters. Everyone makes mistakes. He obviously feels really bad about it. I still think he is a wonderful person. He was probably confused. We all make mistakes. We are not God. You haters probably have done something much more terrible than he has ever done altogether in his life. Move on you haters. I feel sorry for you haters. Don’t worry Mr. Will Smith. You have many people who still have your back.
2 million views and 86 thousand likes? this must be a great apology video
Let go and move on. No one is above mistakes and recognizing it means is another. Goodluck
Way to late bro
pure hypocrisy man.
I used to really like Will, but after this outbreak I lost all respect for him.
People in Hollywood are so jacked up, get help :( love yourself
It was "the piece of sh!t" part for me.😹😭
This apology seems more for Will than it does Chris.
Through the flaws and challenges of our own humanity, we feel for you and encourage you to experience God’s peace and forgiveness. In the words of Donnie McClurkin… We Fall down… BUT we get UP!!! ❤️🙏
Notice how he says "I apologize" to Chris and Chris's family but he says "I'm sorry" to his own family.
We need to stop putting these people on pedestals. They play pretend for a living. That’s all. They are completely disconnected from reality. Have to move past this period of our cultural evolution.
Good for you WILL, honestly yes it sucks it happened, no one is going to be as hard on your as you are going to be, cut yourself some slack. We are all only human to Err is Human they say, all we can do is move forward and do better!!! Still my hero Will!!
I forgot about it thnx for reminding us
immediately disliked. I wish I could see the ratio...
That's a BS apology .  FAKE !
WE GOT YOU KING #CLM FOR LIFE !!!
We’re all human, we all make mistakes… yes that was a huge one. I hope Chris and his family forgives you. Will keep your head up and don’t be ashamed💞💫
WTF is this
Perhaps the whole Smith family can admit that it's over for them. The one who brought the fame is the one who took it all away.   It doesn't take 4 months to apologise. It does take 4 months before an agent would say "just do the apology video, we will just say we reached out to him, even though we wanted him to be in this video".   I'm over the Smith family now. You guys are toxic.
No one cares
he apologised, just gotta move on from now
Come on, Will. Corporate/Youtuber appology?! Really.
Man I really wish the dislike were available
Does anyone have the link to the interview with Chris' mother?
Lapse of judgment may be an understatement. I do feel unlike most here, this was from the heart. Regardless it take years to build a reputation and seconds to smash it. I doubt Chris or the public will ever forgive Will, as forgiveness is a forgotten lesson in life these days.
cant hate on this man no matter what at the end of the day he is a human being with faults he is not perfect and he is doing the best he can in a situation that is super tough .. will smith is amazing always have love for this actor
Can we talk about the water product placement???? For an apology video??????????
Will’s right, he made a mistake. Nobody has to forgive him for it. But other peoples forgiveness, including Chris, doesn’t matter. In order for Will to get on with his life he most importantly needs to forgive himself.
So so set up 🙄 even down to the branding of water that he’s drinking 🤔 and we’ll edited ☝️
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏♥️♥️💗💗💗
He was seen partying it up right after this video.
fake
Suprised he didn't bring a dog out for sympathy points
Your Art on the wall is ironic.
Yeh I forgive will  he’s only human I hope he gets to start acting again I here bad boys 4 is happening?
For the people who can't see this video currently has 119k dislikes 😕
God I hate celebrities.
🤡
4:10 its weird he has kind of a smile in these sentences from here on out
Pro tip, don’t jest, or smile…ever again in public or on your social media.  You lost me at the event and you re-lost me at 2:45. Just go away.
85k likes and 119k dislikes... Dang this says it all.
AFTER 4 MONTHS???? I like you brother, but.....
Will turn off your comments and come back this time next year.
He even had the nerve to put his book in the bottom before the comments🤡💀💀
This is like a crumbled piece of paper. You can straighten it out again and try to make it right but the creases are left behind and there’s no way of getting them out. Also nobody wants to use that paper again.
Honestly would have just preferred it if you came out and justified your actions, would have been way more funny and you had the time to prepare arguments lmao.
What Will did was unacceptable he embarrassed Chris in front of his own family. For the same woman who slept with his sons bestfriend.
We love you anyway
Release Felix here!!! Where is PewDiePie???
You have problems
Man. U. Fac. Tured.
Is it just me or do he look different.
A list actor fasho
So....now, it's convenient to apologize after realizing your popularity-capital is bankrupt.  Sorry, not sorry. 🤷🏾‍♂️  Shameful
These comments is so mixed 😭😭. Are y’all forgiving him and think it’s a mistake all humans go through it, or do y’all think that he did to much and this apology was to fake? ⬇️⬇️⬇️
I’m wit you Will….you have my support back then (and most definitely now).   🙌 Heal and ride my Brother…
Getting saved to the apology folder. Some good nuggets in here. There’s no part of me that thinks it’s ok. Just sayin there’s some value here.
The dislike bar was disabled for videos like this
Crazy how a bunch of people think their opinion matters in a situation that doesn’t involve them.
oh man, is'nt too much time for an appology. Should have done it that day man as a man. It shows your weakness and ego mindset. Be kind :)
#cancelwillsmith Your actions were unacceptable.
It’s all good man. We all make mistakes out of anger. You have a fan base that supports you. Since DAY 1. But yes, control your anger. Analyze everything before you take action!  Much love man! You will always go down in my heart as “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.” We love you man 😎👏
Love you will and also Chris too
The only thing he regrets is the fact that his career is currently at a standstill. He can sure act, as you can see in the video above!
real cringe
cringe
Will you can’t carry weight for years nobody is perfect, what happened was sad but you live and you learn
🎵IT'S TOO LATE TO APOLOGIES 🎶 IT'S TOO LAAAÀAATE 🎵😂
The greatest thing we can do is forgive our fellow man. And I hope truly that Chris and his family bless you with forgiveness. Continue your work of repentance Mr Smith. I say Mr Smith, as truth is just because I see you work it doesn’t mean I know you. I forgive you and feel much empathy for you…I’ve made some horrible mistakes as well. I hope you see there is an opportunity now more than ever for you. A glorious one. Greater than your error is your return to humility, now with your blessings bestowed you coupled with this humility what can you do to honour the life you have been given? Remember David….
Truly one of the apologies of all times.
Can’t wait to see Chris and Will collaborate but healing and respect and love is much needed.
Finally the 4 months of training arc is done, super hype with the next arc
Your day 1’s are still here with u Will!!!  Like all of us that are human, we all make mistakes. This doesn’t define you as a man and you’re still the human hero that inspires the 🌎. Take care of yourself and know that we love ya buddy. 🙏🏼❤️🐐
This reminds me of that one scene in the boys where the deep apologizes and it’s super fake and does it just for his status lmao. i know this is sincere but it just feels too real xD
We got another apology on our hands.
We all make stupid mistakes, I hope things can get straightened out between you guys and every one In your lives that have been effected . Still a fan of yours bro . I definitely think you have still done more good than harm in this world.
Unless chris accepts an apology this is bullshit. Also the fact you couldn’t just address chris you didn’t have to make a YouTube video to tell us that you are apologizing to chris. Especially after so much time as passed by it doesn’t seem sincere
Ok ok a smile has emerged! You welcome back to the cookout! We all got that one drunk uncle that be punching in the air. But we keeping our eye on you and that funny looking potato salad! lol ☮️ and ❤️
That’s a lot of hand activity
Yung Dub D checking in the rap Sensation on the rise

This is not genuine. Remember guys, he’s an exceptional actor.
This seems like a therapy process, acknowledging, taking responsibility but it's not an authentic apology. It's up to Chris to forgive not the public
Wish I could see the like to unlike ratio on this one.
The same people that wrote Ivanka's speech worked on his.. will's draft was expected to be finished in the new year.
Whether 4 months, 4 years, 4 decades, Will has asked for forgiveness, which is part of the healing process.  To not forgive or deny him would be the greater sin.  Hopefully Chris can start that healing process soon too.  Peace out Will!  ❤ ✌
NOPE
Well, jeez dude, this was three months later. You got anger issues and that's the only truth. I won't judge you, but at least you show some remorse of you bad behavior, therefore this is over for me, I'll remove you from my famous black list.
Nice to see the stage continues. 👍🏾
4 months, and now he apologizes? With a YouTube video? Man's chasing clout, or trying to get his rep back since nobody wants to hire him. He's not sorry at all. Rich people, man :/
Will…. You still my guy. I wont allow a mistake to erase all the positives you have done..
Keep deleting comment smh
Bit too late bra
No thanks.
what took you so long to apologize? so it literally took you 4 months to decide you should apologize 🙄🙄
Yeah he apologized but I’ll never look at Will the same again.
There IS a part of you that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment: it's the part of you that DID behave that way - that's still inside you. Until you face that part of you, you're not really doing the work to change.
This is the worst acting I've seen since Gemini Man.
I'm sure your wife's boyfriend is proud of you for following the Youtuber Apology Script to the letter
👏  We make mistakes.
At this point it doesn't matter if Chris and his momma forgives you or not. You've said sorry, you're human, forgive yourself first and make peace with yourself, and then everything and everyone else will follow. If you don't forgive yourself, people will just mirror that back to you forever.
Ewwww cringe when he calls her babe🙄
These comments are being manipulated to reflect only “positive” views and not dissenting opinions. This is a PR ploy
Sending love to Will. I hope Chris is OK. I hope Will is OK.  Sending love and hope for peace.
I love Will. His actions that night has not changed my opinion in the slightest. He has demonstrated his intentions to be a role model in his community. But he is not God.  His actions are actions every human has considered or even acted upon at some point in their lives. Everyone makes mistakes.  Only God reserves judgement.  Not man.  Stay Prayerful
No excuses were made, and you have expressed a commitment to do better. That is the best any human being can do after the fact. You might think as a public figure, you are defined by your mistakes, or as a movie star, defined by your work, but that is simply not true. You are a dynamic, growing human being and this apology is a step forward. Good on you.
#1 on trending!!
BS
Will Smith, you're still my hero ❤️
There was nothing for me to forgive him for as I do not know him and am not one who is compensated by increasing or leveling his brand.  Not sure what purpose of the video is other than to gauge how the general public feels so he can eventually return to work.
Will Smith cooks his wife's boyfriend dinner.
weakness disgusts me
You shouldn't apologize anyone for anything ... I hope you will understand this someday. I belive you were forced to do this, but theres way more important things than peoples opinions or contracts which you loosing cause of "that" behavior etc. Stay healthy, stay true and fVck the rest.
anyone else think that looks like the coziest shirt of all time?
Apology video review:  -Will seems somewhat remorseful of his actions, he speaks with regret in his voice, but then again he's an actor so I'd be surprised if he couldn't. Pretty good but could better, 7/10  -Will didn't cry and say "I made a continuous lapse of judgment" 2/10 -This video doesn't feel authentic, it feels like an interview which is a weird approach but whatever 5/10 -It took you a solid 4 months to come up with this, which is kinda sad cause this apology is more mid than the Snyder cut but 6/10 Final rating: 5.5/10
You couldn’t apologize earlier? You should apologize next year then 😂
If anyone is wondering, the video currently has 117k dislikes (July 30th)
#TeamWill...love you. People are hypocrites and love to throw stones from a glass house.
This is the only bit of acting you’ll be doing for a while I’d say.
Way too many people here with their full names as their account names 😅🤤 Time to hear some emotional opinions;/
Now let's see August's apology video
Omg this is deep
The fact that I just left the video playing and went straight to the comments. I seriously have lost all respect for this guy and I don't think that will change for a very long time!
Hopefully his career ends soon.
I forgive you will, even if the world's doesn't forgive you, nor accept your apologies. I forgive you. Hopefully Chris does the samething.
I really do believe Will is remorseful. He’s a good guy whose emotions got the better of him. I’m not sure what it’s going to take to repair his image for some people but I hope he can find a way to put this behind him.
Notice he’s wearing a sponsored Wahlburger hat? He most likely actually got paid money while doing this. PATHETIC to use an apology video to make money. Wtf…
we are all human and I appreciate your honesty Don't let it wait to heavily on you
Ohhh, that's hot. That's hot!
I think what people don't realise is when somebody does something bad, very often one starts justifying it becuase it is difficult to accept what one did. That is why it takes time to own what you did and to apologise. I feel very sorry to what happened to Chris, but I think this is great that Will apologised.  We are all flawed and only God can heal whatever needs to be healed... Good luck,Will!
Does his eye shrink or its just me ?
Mr. Imma Stick beside Her
Sounds fake and scripted. Who the hell apologizes by saying 'I apologize to you Chris' you say I'M SORRY' like you mean it, sounds so insincere.
This man is so scripted
Nah bro, walk up to Chris and offer a heartfelt apology and then tell YT you are both on good terms instead of making it look like you're apologizing to the public when it was Chris you humiliated
she's got him so whipped, he doesn't even know.
Cadê os br
His sons water bottle brand being promoted in this makes the apology so sincere
Im my own opinion humble opinion and thoughts are how do magnets work?
I wonder what YTP makers will think of this
Everyone makes mistakes, that's why pencils have an eraser on the end. You're an incredibly talented actor but also a human being. You and your family have been on a journey and learnt from this experience. You have apologised and accepted the consequences of your choice of action. You are a good man who didn't make the best choice. We all still love you and wish you peace, love, light and healing xx
after 4 months? bruh we all moved on, if you wanted to make more of an impact you do it a day or 2 after the incident. smh this video is mad dumb
An entitled bully posting about his own suffering after realizing this isn’t going to go away. Nicely produced video though. A few dollars on that screen.
hes got some healthy regrets right now
I am sorry, but what I think needs to be expressed is what was going on at that moment through your mind. How you know it's wrong and how you are making sure it will never happen again.
not the "thanx"
lmao, less views and subs than charlie. that's rough to get dunked on by a celebrity more relevant than you
Will you are a human and we are all fallible. Keep moving forward in your positive light and try not to continue to beat yourself up. Stay strong my friend!
Why 4 months?
Will, you don't have to say anything except "Chris, I am sorry." That's all, nothing more or less. No need to explain anything. If you trully want to apologize that is all you need.
N tienes q disculparte  q sea actor y una persona publica n quiere decir q aguantes todo eres un ser humano normal como todos  se lo merecía vamos will
My wife's boyfriend(s)
Maybe you should offer Chris a free shot that might help in the healing process. Being from Philly myself an Eye for an eye and all that.
You’ve gone right down in my estimations. You humiliated him and humiliated yourself, your family and your industry. You should be ashamed of yourself. You were a role model and you have wrecked your career and your reputation. I’ll never watch or engage in anything endorsed by you.
There No Way You Coming Back. Know How Sensitive The World Is Now
Do you want brownie points for apologizing?
I love Will, He was my favorite actor, but this look so fake and generic
It took you four months to be able to come out with this? :( you should have been out every single day trying to make up for this. Not showing your elitism even more by taking 3 months to “self inspect”
I will never loom at you the same.
God bless you brother don’t worry man we all make mistakes 🤛🏽

Getting CUCKY with it 🎵🎶  nah nah nah nah nah nah 🎶🎵 Getting CUCKY with it 🎶🎵
I love this.
Most insincere apology. I've seen AH with more conviction than this. He's only remorseful that this whole debacle didn't go in his favor and that he received as big a back lash as he did.
Did anyone see the mad TV redo of OJ's explanation video? Will at the end reminds me exactly of that actor trying to keep a straight face while saying, as oj, "I will not rest until I find the real killer" and he never was able to complete it without breaking up laughing. That's what Will reminds me of
Thank you, We must learn to forgive, we are not perfect. NO ONE
CLM
Everything about this video feels wrong. He needs theraphy. It doesng come over genuine.  Imagine how worse it even was 4 months ago. The demons are not yet ready with you Will smith. Im a Will Smith fan.
You spent a lot of time in your head. Little time in your heart.
What an act Will 😂. Took you this long to realize your behavior was unacceptable? Had to really practice what you were going to say in this video huh?
#CLM
You looked pretty remorseful at the after party dancing wirh your award.
I fr will never watch one of his movies again
I believe you, but You were completely out-of-character that night.  Much love xoxo
im sorry babe xox
Yahh, it’s rewind time. You know, if I could control rewind..I would want…Fortnite..and marques brownlee.
You are still my favorite! Don’t let anyone make you feel bad for something we have all did! You are human ! Period
STAY STRONG BRO EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES
im sorry babe xox
CLM
im sorry babe xox
Your acting has gotten worse over the years. This apology doesn't even sound sincere.
This is deffo jadas fault, that woman's bad
معك الحق
Hi Will were all human. I hope you can get on the same page with Chris. And that something beautiful can come from this sad incident. You’re still a nice guy.
Will, go away from us with this.
pos
you, forever, now will be known, as the Super CUCK, from now on, they will say "never go full Will Smith", or "get Jaded" XD Laughing Stock of a generation
Nice to see him acknowledge Questlove and how he ruined everyone else’s night. But it’s weird that he says he doesn’t want to feel ashamed of himself. Shame is essential to remorse. When we err, that feeling of shame is how we stop ourselves from repeating mistakes. More people these days need to understand true shame and experience it. The lack of it is why society keeps getting worse. Nobody’s ashamed of anything, so they feel entitled to do whatever they please with no regrets.
*Dislike*
Praying for you. You the reader of this comment. I love you.
I say this without agenda but it was still a crime committed on air in front of millions of people and your fellow actors. You should have been arrested anything beyond that is not for me to say. Doing this feels like a PR move and honestly Will this move made me respect you less.
This is a bald headed lie. 😂😂
I love you will nice drip
Man, I wish I could see the dislikes!!

Idk, Will. That ""fog" seemed to last through you partying it up at the after party scene. You didn't seem too fogged out to celebrate your yourself that night. Get real or save the PR efforts for someone willing to accept a half-apology.
lol this video is suppressed in the search results. i had to go directly the channel and then click on videos to see them all in order to find it. every search result was someone talking about the video
Shame is not a bad emotion in every instance. It is appropriate to feel shame when you hurt someone unnecessarily. In this case, as you pointed out, many people were hurt unnecessarily. The spirit can feel indicted. Shame tells us that we've made a choice that, if given the chance to make the choice again, we would not. Shame passes when the spirit determines that amends have been made and/or the lesson has been learned. I wish you the best.
Watch a Jordan Peterson video.   Embrace masculinity.  None of this should be public.  All of this should be private.  You keep listening to people that do NOT have your best interest at heart.  You are visibly broken.   LEAVE!  Leave all that you know and become mentally and physically tough.  Learn to be alone and embrace it.  Learn who you are again and embrace it.  Then the real you can come back.
Let someone twice your size have a free shot and you have my forgiveness lol. Any suggestions as to who are welcome...
😂🤣
I wonder what he expects as an outcome from this video
I believe him as much as I believe bush
Who asked
I still think your a great actor 👍
Don't even read the comments. Man apologized - they having a ball crucifying him. Why do you care people ?  I'm sure you are 1/100th  of the man he is !
Everyone makes mistakes just like you and I! It's just a minor mistake you must move on and everybody loves you 😊. I enjoyed your music/show/movie all the time and you must focus on positive sides from now.
You have never stopped being my Friend Will & your entire Family! Just know that❤️!
Will is the same guy that wrote a song where he described just how much of a Nice Guy he is
Top 10 worst apologies ever. Seriously it's been 4 months, you're clearly not sorry. You watched you career just implode and so to try and salvage it you upload a 5 minute video with a fake apology.  You are not better then anyone. You're an actor and this is a great piece of acting.
This is really inspiring for that us all can be honest and forgiving with our own mistakes. Even though I still don't think you were all wrong at the time. Chris also owes several apologies and I hope he'll be able to do it with half the courage and honesty that you are showing us now, Will. I support you!
#DHARMANN PREDICTED THIS MOMENT
People make mistakes. It’s a part of being human. It is up to Chris to forgive him but everybody else don’t need to punish him.
What took you so long
Bro until you talk to chris i wont forgive you
All I can say is, good luck, Will. I won't judge but I can't stop thinking about the "scene" when I see him. It's gonna take some time for me to see Will as the way it was because I realized that this family is full of empty words for shows.
It took this long for his hand to heal?! 😅
Good people do bad things. You're forgiven.
I feel sometimes when u r the person always smiling and making people happy. When we they do get angry they pop off because they hold repressed feelings. Not making excuses but Will is always happy but he has to suppress emotions. I hope he can move past this. All he can do is apologize to Chris.
ok...
This would've been nice...... four months ago
Jesus your fine why is everyone so soft
A Man Owns His Rights/Wrongs. You're doing that. To Be Flawed-- Is To Be Human Will. Maturity can only be measured by our immature moments, and the lessons we use to better ourselves, as Best we can. Much Respect. Just Be Real.
A. MAKE a point to talk to Chris B. It took almost 4 months 4U to get this apology? C. This is not a fan/audience issue.  Talk with Chris.
Whatever happened I like you Will as a good actor and  a writer. We're all make mistakes it's fine. Respect u for what u did in your life
"Its like" that classic will tone came out there. I miss that will.
I tried to forget what you did and remember everything about you before all of this and leave it at that. “It was nice knowing you, thanks for the entertainment”. But you came back with more personal problems. Nobody watching you knows you personally. Get back to work, do something with Chris to get things straight and later ride into the sunset. I could care less about your personal feelings. Just stop this. It’s that easy.
I would have liked to hear him say that he is seeking help with his mental health, because he objectively needs it. What he did at the awards was not a normal healthy reaction.
3:00 cap 🧢
Find Christ again, start hanging out with Denzel and not those other Hollywood elite.
Bro who wrote his script😂
Still promoting Just water in the video🤣 asif it isn't coincidence that it's there on the table perfectly in the middle
Apologies; and then what follows? You trying to sell a book? Really?
A lot of ppl are saying this is another youtuber apology video, but good or bad, it's very different, straight forward and it seems quite honest. No waffling, few excuses, he answered questions and I don't hate him more cause of this
cringe
He got emotional, was a but weird, embarrassing. But as a fan i can forgive. But i will never get over how Hollywood in the room acting like nothing happened .
Gotta have the YouTuber dramatic entrance for empathy
It’s been a year daddy
Lost all respect to him
Hollywierd is the best thing of the past upto date.
Man I get a very uncanny feeling from him in this video
🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱
It’s fake. I don’t see no tears
People make mistakes, that includes myself and you currently reading this comment. Forgive, forget and move on. Will Smith is human and so are we
“IM TALKING ABOUT THE GDMN ALOPECIA JOHN” IRobot
100% fake "public" apology, and clownishly outrageous... Unless you believe an actor is not acting when in front of a camera. Damn' he even sounds like a preach!
The word 'sorry' is said to express remorse or sympathy. The word 'sorry' has a personal essence in it. Whereas the word 'apology' is used in a formal tone and used when one has done something wrong. While being apologetic, one might or might not be sorry for what they did wrong.
Certified textbook YouTuber apology right here
This is pathetic lol, he’s an actor and he couldn’t even pretend to cry? Everyone knows crying always works 😂
It took months to rehearse something nice but only seconds to reveal who you true self are…
😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡💩
Takes a narcissistic, 5 months and 5 minutes to say sorry 😭
Genuine
Lo dije el día de la cachetada y lo repito ahora, somos humanos, todos nos equivocamos y el que esté libre de pecado que tire la primera piedra, amo tus actuaciones desde que era una niña, igual me gustan las de Chris y seguirás siendo mi actor favorito, gracias por volver
Took him 4 months to realise his behaviour was unacceptable
I would want Fortnite and Markass Brownie!
Chris Brown: I'm not ready to forgive you yet. I need some time. Will Smith: Cool. Let me respect your wish by apologizing to the internet instead.
I honestly didn’t think ppl still cared about this
The world is sick love is the cure ....
He is so good at self reflection and taking responsibility. I respect him more now than before.
You can do this big bro 💯✊🏾
What's with the dislikes, why can't youtube just let someone apologize without picking it apart like some kind of apology experts?
now that's an apology, youtubers should learn from this
We've all done some fuhkt up things. People make mistakes how you get to the other side is the process of being human. Best 2 both men.
Anyone else hear the sigh and think of Dreamworld?  Will Smith: *sigh* my career, left me.
🙏✝️💕🛐🥰🥰 Prayers to you ,Chris ,both families and all of us whom love you both Hugs Xoxo Ms Bethany Williams Jackson MS 🙏💜
Everyone makes mistake... i forgive you... will still watch your movies.. i cant wait to see your next movie...
WOW tok u 4 months just to apologize back?   =/
Good thing you made a successful rap career without using profanity🤣 Too bad you couldn’t make it through an award show without it!
Nuisances and complexities? Dude, you smacked a living breathing human being. Nothing complex about that. Cut the bs and live your life somewhere far from people having a little fun.

No one is perfect. People make mistakes.
Will blink 3 times real fast if you're in trouble.
Bad light placement - big white halo??? Uh uh
Find your disapproval comments and its gone. Only approval comments are allowed here. What an approval seeking guy.
I’m not saying Will was right to do what he did, but Chris wasn’t exactly either.  I get that the latter’s a comedian, but there is a line.
Querido Will, aunque fue muy doloroso verte en esa situación, deseo que seas feliz y tu vida sea mejor que antes del incidente, te quiero y agradezco que estes buscando la reconciliación, has sido alegria para muchas personas y confio en Dios seguiras siendolo, abrazos. ☀🌈😊
🍋✊CLM
Oh dear........
Yea okay. I’ll consider forgiveness when I see shark tale 2.
fake apology. hes just acting
This is Will Smith's journey. This is Chris Rock's journey. Wishing Universal love to them both.
What they say about forgiveness is real.  What they say about forgetting is even more real.
Fake. Where’s his dog, let alone the RAID sponsorship?
Nope. Not buying this. Chris said he wasn't ready. So you decided, screw that, I'm going to make a saccharin video that the whole damn world can watch. This ain't about you, Will. You chose your moment, for good or for ill. Now it's Chris's choice. And you can't even give him that.
Hahahahaha make the memes my brothers ahahaha
I wish we had the dislike number back for stuff like this.
bruh, if Chris said he needs time then just wait until you guys can talk in person, you don't owe any apologies to the public, or atleast wait until you guys talk about it first then say something publicly, I mean it's a good effort but still it feels weird somehow since you mentioned that Chris himself not ready yet to talk about it
Too late will
He was such a great actor and role model. He really let everyone down.  It's unfortunate that this mistake ended his career.
There is something really wrong with this man. Hope he gets the help he needs. I don’t see he is genuine about this tbh, feels more like his HR team told him what things to say to save his image.
Look man, you did a DUMB thing and it was probably the most uncalled for situation i think anyone have ever seen at an award ceremony.   I'm glad you apologized, i think you need to talk way more about how your life has changed because of a split second decision. Getting back to your old rhythm with just an apology video IS NOT going to be the right thing to do here. People will not like that very much. I think you will have to work on your come back for some time.  Looking forward to it. Don't let this one bad night define your entire life. Good luck to you my man.
Black Lives Mattered!
The way people are cold and saying vile things even under an apology video. It's crazy.   They say he shouldn't have made this video. How would he then apologize to his fans?  They say he should have apologized to Chris, he said he reached out and they don't want to speak yet.  They say he's doing this because of his career. Well, shouldn't a man guard his source of livelihood?  They say this apology wasn't sincere enough. What were you expecting? That he should be shedding tears and hugging a puppy?  People will always be people. Keep saying mean and insensitive things under the post of a man trying to pick up the pieces of the legacy he built for years. I hope you find your peace that way.   Will, You made a mistake, and you've owned it. Looking forward to seeing more work from you!! I'm pumped!!!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Welcome to back！！！！！
How you feel about Will after this apology video is part of your human experience. Forgive him or vilify him. It's all happening in your own mind. If you want to follow a group of haters, it's on you. At the end of the day, Will can not judge you. Only you can judge yourself. Big chance he doesn't know you. So be mindful of how you spend your energy and time.
Well done Mr  Will Smith - you have done the right thing. You have done the most difficult thing. What you have done takes great humility. In this you are being a good role model ( you know what I mean ). The devil will certainly hate this !!! We ascend to descend and ascend again even higher !!!
That woman has poisoned your mind Will.
I feel like a teacher hearing the dumbest excuses from a kid
tbh after reading his book, i forgive him for doing what he did. not an excuse for anything, but somebody who does know where he comes from and what he went through, i can understand the mindset he was in at that point of time. much love will, always cherish your role in the fresh prince <3
Fake apology
Great to see your courage – here in Australia we know everybody is gonna slip up – when we slip up we laugh at ourselves not at other people but at  ourselves - it’s great to see your remorse – but time to make light of yourself for what you did so you can let it go and you can carry a bit of laughter back into the world that way – if you can work out how to do that we might have to make you an honorary Aussie
Sounds like he wasn’t getting roles anymore
The entire family is off the wall arrogant even by Hollywood standards. The truth is his behavior that night was entirely consistent with what we've seen before from him. Maybe he should be ashamed.
"It's too late to apologize."  - Timbaland
If so mad that he didn't realise that he made a severe and continuous laps in his judgement
didn't say "im sorry" to chris
L
This is getting old. We don’t care. Fix yourself. Do it on your own without the need for public attention.  Leave Chris alone. Just go away.
I get it, she had you training for Superman.
Clown.
Took him only 4 months to come to realize.
cringe
Lol This like a YouTuber apologizing to their fans 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I don't find these apologies genuine
🤚💫
Chama o cris
I grew up on saved by the bell, and several of your other movies.  We all make mistakes,  I hope you can come back from this.
average apology video be like
This is dumb ……
Thank you, next.
Scientology not even once
Are we getting another youtube rewind starring Will The Great Smith???
We all make mistakes.
You apologized but I didn't feel that you were sorry, anyways not my busniess. Hopefully Chris reaches out.
Dear Will,  As a fan I can only imagine that this must be the longest minute of your life. I feel that you are sincere and remorseful for that night. As a human myself, I too made and make mistakes, but I do not have the world looking at me through a magnifying glass, Judging, criticizing etc, etc… As a fan I forgive you Will, because you are a good person and you have done wonderful things. Moving forward from here I trust you will continue to do and achieve remarkable things to come. I thank you for this YouTube clip. Some voices in the large crowd may continue to hand out judgment, critiques, and sentencing. Will just stay sharply focus on the Good Person You Are and do the wonderful thing you do and for all of us in the crowd, that night will be fuzzy and blurry night too.   Dear Chris, As a fan of yours too. I do not know your true feelings towards Will. But if I could take this opportunity to say thank you for reserving opinions. You could have so easily taken the path to revenge, payback or getting even, but you have not. I respect that you will speak if you choose to when you are ready to speak. You are certainly entitled to your true feelings good or bad and as a fan I will respect your feelings. Chris You too are good and wonderful person and thank You for your work. Just another Fan 🙂  Kyto Fade out
Love you Will. Always have, always will ♥️♥️
Maybe let Chris talk 1st! Cause this style of interview/apology seems very staged and not authentic!
I would have done the same thing with no regrets. My family comes first and foremost. My career is not in the "Business ' . So I can understand Will has to toe the line in a sense. Just to stay relavant. But screw the " Business". You disrespect the woman who bore my children. My blood. My legacy. The woman I married and made a sacred vows too. He's lucky it wasn't me. I'd of done far worse
He only apologize due to public pressure and concern for his purse
I feel like this isn't ultimately any of our business. Nor is it our offense to forgive.   There won't be any stone throwing from over here. I accept that Will is human and that humans sometimes react in poor ways to powerful emotions. Sometimes those reactions are monumentally poor. The offender can only apologize, make amends in the best way possible, and try to move on. As onlookers (and that's all we are), our response should be to let the person do so.
Chris: I'm not ready to talk to you yet. Will: That's cool man but imma just going to publicly talk at you for a bit and ignore your wishes.
WOW you promoting your book in this video. I just change my like to dislike.
Forgiveness is key.
You do not need to apologize as the other person didn't do the same
We forgive Will Smith ❤
Come on Will! 4 more months and you will be ready to quit as a member of the Academy.
Is that bottle of water from Jayden's company?!? Undermines your sincerity Will! It's bad enough that it took way too long to get to this point; you then leave us with the impression that marketing was actually a consideration as part of planning this "genuine apology".
We love you big homie and things will only go up from here. You are legendary and one mistake DOES NOT define you! Keep it pushing
Bro made an apology video 💀
Yeah, let's give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate
You can see it in his eyes.  This man is broken
Love that you are being the bigger man https://youtu.be/Ws8J3MXZ21Q
If you were a normal person you'd be charged with a crime, you weren't because this is the power of celebrity and money.
Ok so this is just manipulative 😂
Bro. Rest in the notion that you're NOT the Light, Jesus is. You're but a mirror that reflects His glory. We're all sinners who fall short of the glory of God. However, through faith in Christ, the image of God is rightly restored. All Christians rest in the finished work of Christ, whilst simultaneously being transformed into His likeness over time, from one degree of glory to the next. Recognising our sin is a gift from the God. The solution, however, isn't to seek self justification but instead to run to Him who redeems, reconciles, and restores broken sinners. ✌️♥️
We have all done questionable things in the heat of a moment. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. The fall out from that behavior is a process that can either make or break a person. Don't let it define who you are,  just learn from it and make the necessary steps to fix it. I honestly thought it was a prepared skit or something 🤷‍♀️ and I feel like that's where alot of the confusion came in to play with how to proceed forward. I am rooting for you Will but this video didn't feel sincere. Maybe we can finally get a Wild Wild West 2 please! 🕷
🍋✊ CLM
Nope
This dude is not on his right mind he needs help. Good luck getting your stuff together Will
Use this comment as a dislike button
Friends argue fight make mistakes didn’t disappoint me just helped me realize that we are all human your an actor not god people need to stop
We all make mistakes. You apologized. Chris will reach out to you eventually, hopefully privately. Still love you Will.
Thanks Will !
LE LOURRRDDDD
Will could really use that rewind button right about now.
A fake living room set, multiple cameras/angles, lighting...seems genuine.
Its ok Will, hope to see you again in movies.
Will smith man...
You are in we are heart will
You were hurt
CLM
Any one can say I apologize but thats not what he is looking nor us as fans, you need to say sorry not i apologize
YouTube needs a laugh react
"Take 125 aaaannndd....ACTION!" 🎬
Praying for discernment for you🥺
Not the white shirt and hat for a YouTube apology video 🤦‍♀️🤣 Gotta portray a look of innocence lol!
Still love you Will Smith ❤️❤️ everyone has some bad moments in life.. you are a human being after all and you deserve to be excused just like the rest of us.. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
hes about to start more drama just say sorry in person there is no need to do it out on youtube wat
Yeahhhhh its rewind time
"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."  - 1 John 1:9
How dare you!  P.S.  I'm offended.
We all make mistakes! There are a lot of people that still love & support you! Focus on the positive & not the negative! Much respect!
Anyone else feel like there will be an another apology video in another 4 months?
The scene is about emotionality. Where is it?   —Kirk Lazarus
I’m not one to judge Will’s sincerity of this apology and the internet can never be satisfied with any apology given to them for any reason.   But really what matters more is what Chris thinks of the apology. Only he can accept it. So I guess time will tell.   I can only wish the best for the two of them honestly.
You should apologize to me. I'm tired of hearing about it. Btw save yourself and break free from that TOXIC WOMEN
Omg I didn't even know he had a YouTube channel and the first one I watched is an apology video ironically.
No excuse for this taking 4 months to put out.
I've watched this multiple times and the thing that sticks with me is the concept of being remorseful without being ashamed.  When you finish the work Will , please share with us how to accomplish that.  I beat myself up relentlessly for the smallest things and would love to know how to experience "healthy" regret.
he just took a time to think about his actions and he is sorry now,why is everyone saying he is a bad man...we are all human beings. Can we at least appreaciate the fact that he, after all, did apologize?
He’s trying to salvage his career.  Boy please! Most insincere apology ever honestly, it took him 5 months to prepare for this role. He's not sorry he did it, he's sorry he got such a strong backlash over it! These kinds of things can ruin a career.
It was a big mistake, it's good you admit it and apologize.
It takes a lot to admit you're wrong, apologize and ask for forgiveness. Some people will never do it regardless of the harm they've done. Everyone has done something in life they're not proud of. Public figures just get more light shined on the mistakes. We can never reel back in our actions or words. Choices have consequences. Time heals a lot of wounds.
Will you have made 1 mistake in your long career your a amazing man you and Chris are boys hope it works out with you 2
The only way anyone can move past this is if you break up with that witch
big ups
I'm deeply disappointed by your actions. We will never be friends again Will 💩
속상쓰 윌스미스 홧팅
I've had the privilege of meeting Will and to witness him with other fellow crew members before. he is a very nice guy. And whatever it is he's dealing with or needs work on I wish him nothing but the best
I forgive this men for what he did, and he needs to be having a newest start for a newest chapter for his life including his family life to make it more secured in the world.😎🙂🔥🎆🔥🎆🎆🔥
Bye.
For anyone wondering this is at 112k dislikes at 83k likes lol
AIN’T NO FAN BOI OF YOU NO MO  You exhibited you lack proper coping mechanisms . Heck, fortunately you weren’t packin heat.
From a universally loved actor to a universally hated one. Truly, the human nature shows it's disgusting side when someone makes a mistake.
It's okay, I'm sure you of all people can afford the law suit
Uncle Phil is pissed at you Boy
P
and the hole just got deeper 🤦‍♀️
Him looking over at the script like 👀
Why is he talking like a robot?
Will is on damage control because he realizes his golden ticket has been torn apart. Poor wILL won’t ever work in Hollywood again. Massive boycotts for his work coming.
Y'all know YouTube dislike ratio ain't gonna show how much less likes he got then the likes he shouldn't even earn.  I guess he trying but it's still insincere. He should've apologized right there and then instead waited for the consequences of himself being hurt for his career. Now he Wanna camera up and say I'm sorry. I wouldn't accept it, id respectfully understand and may forgive but no. He has made a grave mistake on men of society today. Will has a lot to atone for his misbehaving attitude. I can't even laugh, will u really disappointed us. Please keep aspiring to do better from now.
should be in jail
Ahhh, that's hot, thaaats hot!
This feels kind of staged, too much of a production. An apology should come from the heart. Im guessing everything in view of the camera is there for a reason. I could be wrong, maybe this is just another room in the Smith mansion.
We will never be friends again! You crossed the line and now trying to convince people that it wasn't you!? The energy put into this 'perfect youtuber apoology' could be transferred to an attempt of answering the question what's wrong with me and my relationship...
i'm happy for you bro or sorry that happened   also #CLM 🍋✊
Will got some tips from Logan Paul
Don't ever act again will
For those who can't see the dislikes: It's currently :  Likes: 83K Dislikes: 112K
he didn’t even include tears
He seems to have forgotten how to read and talk smh
The only way the apology works is if you and Chris get together and have a laugh about it ( and show us) You fucked up. You know and he knows. See if you can be friends. Go to him. But first get rid of all the pride and prejudice.
Will your reaction was adequate and understandable. Not even a comedian has the right to take other people's mouths just to entertain at any cost. It will also be a lesson for Chris in the future.
4 months of academy training well spent
Damn, this video has more dislikes than likes
Sponsored by Water
The title should be “it’s been four months……..”
Great acting skills here Will, for once you were someone other than yourself.
He must be so unemployed that he did apologize after all
None of this seems genuine
For those making fun of him for this: how would you suggest someone come back from what he did? He made a horrible mistake and acted out of his emotions. I’ve done tons of things in my life that I’ve woke up the next day, ashamed and trust me, there’s no perfect way to say you’re sorry for being an idiot
Glad to see you in front of a camera will.
Who choosed to put that spherical lamp right behind will's head?
Lmao
Will is lucky that YouTube deleted the dislike count, pretty sure this video is ratio'd like a mo-fo
hard to appreciate this when yall on twitter the day after saying "THATS HOW WE DO IT!😂😂😂😂  "
This is honestly pretty embarrassing. It reeks of PR team bullshit.
OMG. What people don't do for money!
Man all this proves is that you're a great actor...but the role of apology should of came much more natural and in less than 4 months...
Everybody gets to have a bad day.  It defines us somewhat.  It's up to Chris to forgive him. But forgiveness is for the victim so that they get to move on.  Will already demonstrated that he moved past it and perhaps he learned something about himself.   I learned that I liked young Will and lost interest in older Will once I started learning about the evolution of his personal values.   He can be a good actor.  That's the box I keep him in.   I wish him good luck and don't expect anything out of him other than to be an actor.
Will, Thank you!!!  I have read some negative comments concerning your apology. What I will say is that  I appreciate the time you took to reflect and take ownership of your actions. You are human and you make misstates  just as everyone does. The difference is we as your fans make mistakes and poor choices but its not televised or posted.  You mentioned that you did reach out to Chris earlier but people gloss over that.  I really appreciate that you took the time, sought help to  understand the what and the why behind your actions .This indicates to me that you did not want to just provide a " I'm sorry" to please the public in their desired timeframe. But you you took accountability and the time to really understand how to work within yourself as so this will not happen again.  Someone said it took you 4 months to get this apology right through training. I totally disagree. You are an amazing actor and you can drop lines like nobody. I say that it to took 4 months to understand YOU and be able to  reflect and share what you have learned. You have more work to do as do we all.  I just wanted to  let you know that  you have  people out here that do not condone what you did,  but understand that you are working on you.   I believe  you are being sincere,  and most of all you understand that there will be negative comments and conversations. Yet, you still  addressed it.  Thank you  and I pray that somehow someway this unfortunate event, can be used to benefit others.
Nah get rid of Jayda
We all human. We’re all emotional, and we all make mistakes. Just gotta learn and Move on !
I don't have bad things to say on will I really don't care about Internet and controversy His behaviour got popular because of toxic memers that keeps spreading it
More love ❤️🙌🏽
L
He is human, we all have moments where we may not be 100% ourselves. He acted before thinking. I've made mine thank God not in front of the world. Still love Will.
A silly mistake that caused infinite number of memes, we love you both Will and Chris
As a Christian, I believe He did what needed to be done. He reached out to Chris and of course he wasn’t ready to talk but the fact that he tried says a lot. I personally don’t know if his apology was genuine but we shouldn’t ponder on the “what ifs” and just take it for what it is. We’ve all done some ludicrous things in our lives we wish could undo and we all want the same thing Will does. Forgiveness and Reconciliation. Let’s not kick a man when he’s down. May God bless you all.
its been way longer than a minute buddy
I still love you Will 🤍 We understand that you are sorry and we know you have a good heart. We understand that you have gone over everything over and over in your mind and you understand how many people you hurt. People need to get over this and move on. We miss you and your joyful funny personality
I don’t forgive him. Words mean nothing. He has to show it and this is not showing it
Pff jezus… just call the guy and say sorry. Call his mum say sorry. Why do this publicly? No need for that whatsoever. Nobody with a bit of normal sense cares about it. Just go and make movies you’re good at that.
This should’ve never been made.
4 months in the making... Perfectly shot... Perfectly acted... The Citizen Kane of Youtube Apology videos. Will Smith is truly a visionary.
Sorry this is off topic but isn’t he 50 years old? He looks so young
I really fancy some water after watching this. Don't know why. Weird, huh?
"Im not going to unpack all of that right now" Then why are you making a video?
The Smith family is so Toxic
I hope that you and all those affected are healing from this episode 🙏🏼❤️
It’s videos like these which I know would have tons of dislikes and I am so disappointed in YouTube for getting rid of them. Oh well. Another dislike “shared with the creator”
Disappointed you didn't apologize sooner. Also this video seems rehearsed.
Lmao at this one Will dawg what you doing man
We all have tolerances and when we are interrogated, that tolerance threshold is exceeded and we become different people who we don’t recognize.
Just putting it out there that just because someone apologizes does not mean they are entitled to being forgiven or a response. This goes for any of us and Will Smith is no exception.
He looks like a lost little boy in this video. I'm a big Will fan and sad to see him look so broken.
This is one of those times you genuinely wish you could see the like to dislike ratio lol
to the people being condescending in the comments, i hope you never have to ever be in the position of sincerely apologizing to people you hurt and be made fun of and belittle while you do it.   nobody is above mistakes. everybody should admit it, apologize, and do better. the fact that it seems that people aren't even granted the chance to do that nowadays will never sit right with me.
Besides Will isnt a saint he made mistake n his sorry  May however got hurt forgive him  Sometimes anger takes over n we cant handle things hence get things slip out of our hands.. May every1 find a place in their hearts to forgive him  Let's all allow Chris n his entire family to heal then forgive wen the right time comes
👏👏👏 it requires wisdom, humility and vulnerability to acknowledge this kind of thing publicly.
People!!! Stop!🙏 He realized! A person can make a mistake! (Who has not broken out of us? Everyone has an easy life!?) This world is a difficult thing! Forgive each other! Love each other! Greetings from Ukraine!
If Chris never wants to talk about it, that's his right. Bringing all this up again doesn't help anyone. Quietly shuffling off would be in your best interest.
Subtle little Just Water product placement. The brand owned by his son Jaden Smith.
would have been better if not so "produced" and staged and rehearsed
Hola Willard, quiero que sepas, si esque lees este mensaje, que al menos a mí no me has decepcionado. Alguien que puede decepcionarme es alguien que no se retracta de un acto erróneo. La biblia deja claro que las personas estamos en una carrera para hacer lo correcto, y que a veces podemos tropezar. Se habla mucho en memes y en los estados del whatsapp acerca de levantarse cuando se cae, pero nadie esta preparado para caerse y cuando lo hacen, o no se levantan o son señalados como el que tropezó y cayó. Al trabajo que estás haciendo, tanto públicamente como en tu interior se le llama levantarse y es ni más ni menos que lo que se debe de hacer, eso te honra y a mi me hace estar orgulloso de cualquier persona pero en esta ocasión de ti. Tienes mi apoyo y una cerveza cuando quieras por Marbella. Por desgracia no será la unica vez que tropecemos, hay que estar fuertes porque queda más camino... . Un abrazo.🍺🙂👍
Is he reading from a teleprompter? He keeps looking down at something before he finishes a sentence.
"there's no part of me that thinks that's the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults"  ehhh no. still won't forget how you laughed hysterically THEN suddenly felt "offended".
full of it
You say that the relationship's probably irreparable but... jesus, it didn't have to be! Like sure, you fucked up, but if you'd have apologised *quickly* you probably could've gotten things back on track. Maybe don't take 4 months to apologise next time?
I mean to be fair, no fake tears or nothing the guy just said what he needed to say, on camera...
You're human. We make mistakes. People need to forgive and move on. I will always be a supporter and a fan of yours as I have always been since the beginning. Peace and love to you Will ❤️
Rewind time
Much better than most youtube apologies. But it's a bit late
Attaboy Will.. Might've been too long but we're all human. Better late than never. Settle things  and move on.. Life's too short for such drama between friends and family. Peace
👋💨🤣
I’m glad for you Sir, that you’re  beginning this process. Thank you for acknowledging the Mother and Quest Love as well. Understand that this trial is a blessing! Character growth is always beautiful! I pray your true Peace is found! I know you and Chris will work it out! 🙏🏾
Remember u refused to leave the award show when asked multiple times. U had multiple times to fix this u didnt!!!
What took your PR team this long to make this script 😂
We serve a God that is forgiving. You have apologized openly to your peers and to ordinary people. Thank you Jesus! That our Lord and savior sits HIGH and looks LOW. He NEVER makes a mistakes. Move on.  Expecting GREAT things from you. Pa 💘
Best of luck Will.  One minute and a bad decision does not define the sum balance of your life.  But owning up to mistakes takes a great deal of courage, especially so publicly.  I sincerely hope you recieve the forgiveness you seek.    Just a thought - @ 4:50 you mention not wanting to feel ashamed.  I know you are a very proud man and this experience has been so hard for you, but can I just suggest that your sense of shame is (or should be) a central part of the experience.  Acknowledge it, pick it up, feel it, accept it fully - then put it to rest.  You are NOT a piece of S***.  get rid of that idea.  Nobody on this earth is perfect - you did a wrong thing - you should feel some shame;  Its part of the whole bag.   I just worry a little that if you don't accept and deal with it along with the rest, then there will always be an unopened box of stuff in the back of your head you haven't dealt with.    What is done can't be un-done - but in time, wounds heal and its going to be ok.  You learned a lot in the last few months - I'm sure many people going through their own struggles maybe learned a thing or two along with you.
Your apology is way too late and means nothing.  I don’t want to see your face or hear your voice every again.
L
I think its a little too late to be apologizing to us but first off to Chris!! U waited THIS long my dude! I've supported u since i was kid and Im just so disappointed in you. I could never imagine u would do something like this. This apologize doesnt sit well with me when it took u this long to explain yourself!
Ciao Will... Ricordati siamo esseri umani e TUTTI POSSONO SBAGLIARE...
Took him 4 months just respond like a YouTuber would
I love you, Will. Be positive.
too little too late big man but good on you for trying
This is will smith's attempt at getting a job back. This is such crap he destroyed soo many ppls night stayed got his award had a cry then hid for awhile hoping things would settle. U wanna say sorry to Ur kids but they joined in on attacking Chris yeah I think u Ur family n pr team should maybe waited a little longer.
It's so blatantly scripted. It's unfortunate to see
But your righteousness, though. You're saying that just . . . disappeared. Sorry. You think everything you do it 100% justified and that isn't going away any time soon. I wouldn't trust you.
A public apology with zero of that emotion u always have… I hear ego and don’t hear remorse. Too bad too, we loved Will smith.
You’re just human bro. It’s ok. ❤️
At one point, the most charismatic man in the world.  Now reduced to this. I actually looked up to the Fresh Prince. But now, I don't even know what I am looking at. It's extremely painful 🤧🤧🤧
It takes courage to apologize on YouTube imo. At least Will has starting his process and hopefully Chris can get his process going if he has not already. 😢 also just scanning over this comment section shows me there are some savage mofos out here😂🤣
Made a mistake admit apologize and move on.
An apology 4 months later? Too late don't you think? You are propably begging for the studios and the film companies to forgive you
Я так хочу понять ,что он сказал....перевели бы
Why
Oh look, 0 dislikes, another masterpiece Smith.
Andrew Tate > Will Smith
This one forgives you
You’re allowed to be human!!!!  We love you!!!!
I wish I could tell only you this because I am not writing this for all the rest who most probably will neither agree nor understand. Everything happens for a reason, a good reason. This incident has helped a lot of people, it had to be you, someone so big that it had a global impact and that was you. I know this doesn't help you but it's a fact, this has helped many people, I'm not going to say who and how because this is an online YouTube channel and most won't understand a word and most probably attack me. This life works in ways humans cannot control and haven't got the right to judge, full stop. Please do not feel bad and know that with time you'll understand and only time puts everything and everyone in their place. Read below, I've already been attacked by one person. Unfortunately, that's how the majority work, they think they have the right to judge, even when they don't have all the information and have no clue what they're judging.
noted, but still blacklisted. like i did to amber heard....
“We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge that we deem to be justice. But if there is justice in revenge, then that same justice will breed only more revenge and trigger a cycle of hatred.”
Plz ignore spelling mistakes. Sir IT takes a Lot Whatever you Call ne IT Courage. Sense Or anything to Come upfront and apologise. If Crush aproach than it will be win win. Now his Turn to be mödest. You took first step. Well done Sir. Now rather focus on settieling Amber and Depp issue. You will be hopefully that doing Good will be paid of one day rather Waiting for Criss response. Divert your focus.
The Classic Sigh in an apology video.
Sorry man, sometimes an apology just doesn’t cut it.
Booo hooo!
Youtube delete this fools account.. He literally a criminal. Dudes on the Bill Cosby/R.Kelly list. *I spent the last three month hiding* Stay hiding bro
What really gets me is that you seem sorry NOW..but the night you actually did it, your whole family went and partied, joked about it..all that. Your son even joked about it. So I'm not sure how much I believe this. One would think you'd take your family home as soon as possible, to try and process it at that time. I want to think that you really care but those actions do not line up with this. Are you doing it because you actually give a crap?? Or are you doing it because this may continue to effect your career?? To hell with our forgiveness, Chris is the one that needs to forgive you ultimately. Im guessing when he does, so will most of the rest of us.
You want forgiveness? Get Chris
To all those saying this is carefully crafted yeah it probably is but if he’s truly sorry what is he supposed to do?
Let him who is without sin cast the first stone John 8:7
Rethink your moral compass, start by getting rid of the stupid notion Polyamory is good for you and your family
A Real man is what you are brother
Speaking the exact way he reads? Definitely not scripted 👍
It would be much better if you went live on instagram the same day and apologized, said "I fucked up, I'm not perfect yada yada yada" and we would forget about all of it by now. We all know actors are same people as we are, you make mistakes in private and hurt people in private, but when you do it in public it's probably better to act fast and just apologize without all this bullshit from PR.
He did the thing, when the person breathes heavily at the start of the apology video
Bro is a child and is spitting out words at this point
Rip will smith was a great run
Nope. When a person shows you who he is (specially during those key unrehearsed moments), believe him. I don't think I'll be watching any of WS movies from now on.
Lost all my respect
This was nothing more than acting or rehearsed speech. This is not Will Smith I know and this was not from his heart.
its morbin time
Can’t believe Will was able to nearly perfectly pull off the YouTuber apology video after only 4 months of training.
My favorite part is when Will Smith said "I can have a leg in one hand, and a brearb in the other." Truly inspiring. Brearb must be enjoyed with legs.
Dude ain’t making money that’s why he’s out here crying 💀
keep digging
I just don't buy it but hey who am I?
I'm detecting cosmic levels of meme energy here
Hello Will Smith
This right here is what I call a MAN. He has owned up to his actions and sought for forgiveness. That alone has earned my respect. Much love Will.
I think he is really emotionally and psycologically hurt
Afros left their cultural stamp on other aspects of American culture…
Fun fact, the dislikes are more than likes in this video
Just as cringe as Tigers apology.
You just like your dad  now GG will! We need good examples of what not to be in life.
We all make mistakes <3  I forgive you Will live and learn my friend
We are all human and we all make mistakes. ❤ All the love and healing to you friend. Your apology and owning your actions makes you deserving of forgiveness 🙏🏼 ❤ 🙌🏼
FUEGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Let's go king! emoney7🍋✊
Sorry will I grew up watching you but this is just for publicity.
we still love you Mr Smith, Thank you for your apologies
ya his pr team made him do this video
This is NOT an apology! This is Narcissism and Gaslighting!!! 👎🏼
The camera angles 🙄
william
Sorry Will but just seeing you makes people cringe. Don't know when or how that will change but I think it's going to take a lot of time. You might have to just step away from the limelight and reappear years later. Maybe then. Just maybe.
Nothing in the world is black and white. There are grey areas everywhere, and bad things happen to everyone. I don't condone what Will did but I also understand the situation enough to see how quickly things can get out of hand that you can't take back. I hope both can move past this event. Life's too short.
isn't it a bit late for that?
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
So FAKE
Will Smith's career is done. Completely egoistical and unprofessional.
Will reasoning for not apology to Chris is really bad. It's like really yeah right 😕 will
what the dog doin
Nah, I call bullshit.
This.. ain’t it.
I wasn't mad in the first place. He was a human who made a human mistake. I'd be lying if I said I never did something like that before. A few times as a child but still.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
WILL SMITH FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!
🖤🖤
It dosnt matter if it’s four months down the road at least he apologized like y’all some fn wolves
Oh Oh  Richard
Disappointment should never be an option and with all that sprouted from that night, the trust and all else lost because of it will take a long time down the road to recover... if ever but William, keep praying, keep your head up brother and always remember the Phoenix 'will' (pun intended!) rise from the ashes... amen!
Geez, ppl. He went out of his way to address his behavior and apologize. Y’all gonna critique the apology?  How about just acknowledging it and moving on with life?
keep my wifes name OUT YO APOLOGIZING MOUTH
nahh...david dobrik's video was better hahahahaha
Will, I respect and admire your courage and your heart. You are human and owe us as fans nothing. We all mess up. Love you bro. Stay up and focused-greater is ahead of you including deeper healing. ❤️‍🩹🙏🏽
Why does this video keep showing up when I search for Chris Chan's (Sonichu) updates...?
It looks like he's reading off a Monitor in front of him...?
well said.
Took you a while eh? Needed to perfect the script I guess 🤷
I love it. Chris & Will are both great.  This has been the ultimate Ego Death  for both of them. They will continue to shine.
Will Smith looks like Sid from Ice Age.
Dislike button
should have hired pewds to produce an apology video :)
Positive note: at least you apologized some people never do.  Other notes:  that took some time to apologize.   I think you got off pretty easy.
nothing you can do will ever make people forget what you did
If only we could see the ratio of like to dislike I bet it's amazingly disproportionate I mean 82,000 likes outta  2.1 million views at the moment
Todo es actuado recuerden que es actor el ahora dale a decir todo esto porque no quiere perder su público lo que hizo a cris fue muy humillante a sabiendas que el tenía una dis que esposa que desde hace mucho le había visto la cara u actuaba mal con el , el simple sw desquito con cris por sus problemas psicológicos
To the people who doesn't know, In this video.... Likes: 82k Dislikes:108k WHAT THE HELL!!
Aannnndd why did it take him a few of months to do this?   It does not take that long to realise you over reacted and went too far... and dancing and partying after the event like nothing was wrong shows he didnt give a damn at the time.. the first actions people take are the most pure.  I have lost all respect for Will Smith
Glad you're back,Will.
It's okay Will don't beat yourself up. You are only human.❣️
Emotions are one hell of a drug that make us do some of the craziest things!!! I can vividly remember my first fight as a boy where I blacked out and couldn’t see a thing during the scuffle! Anyways, we all have our issues and flaws so it’s not our position to judge other people. If Will is truly in therapy and working towards past traumas I’m happy for him. I love Will Smith and will continue to do so.
I wouldn’t apologize to a single one of these ungrateful, sway of the wind “fans.”  You are human, we all are, we all make mistakes. Don’t let these people break you down and remold you. If you feel you need change make sure it was for you Mr. Will Smith.   I was raised on so much media you’ve blessed us with over the years. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN.
Hahah BOZO
this is the youtube apology video of all time
Will — we know you have such a high degree of empathy to help others. You care way too much what others think and the truth is — you can't! You can be your own worst enemy Will. Calling yourself a piece of s*** is more harmful to yourself and your role models rather then letting go of this constant battle of pleasing everyone around you. Mental health matters, and you have a lot of self care/self love to do. Most importantly stop putting yourself on such a high pedestal. This is just someone looking from the outside in. Much love. ❤️
Sad and pathetic
All this so you don't get brunt of the general public who wouldn't wanna watch you or your work if you dont "do this" or "need to do this". It took you 4 months for a simple apology when it could have been done the same day or the next or the next week (even privately) but this just put things in perspective 👏🏼😒
you'll... you'll.....       never be the same in our hearts man😢
How many takes and script rewrites did it take to nail this video?  Let me grab my calculator.
He just promoted his book🤣
It's not our place to forgive you or not. Only Chris can truly do that. Watching this 5:44 minutes video.. Months later... I'm just amazed how much the rich, powerful & privileged can actually get away with.   That's the lesson here for us common folk watching your movies and elevating you & your peers with our money & views:  Don't idolize people who aren't in the same scale of life as you. Most of us would be out of a job and probably in jail.
I feel that was little too late unfortunately. It may have been better to talk less about his own feelings and how he has been hurt.
At least he did a better apology than Logan Paul and James Charles. Will Smith did seem fairly sincere for the most part.
Eat one up and hiccup, Billy
All he needs is a dog or cat and some fake tears, then the apology is complete
It took will 4 Months to post a Video titled it's been a Minute, while it took a minute to toss a man's dignity in front of millions,
This isn't just will sitting in front of a webcam apologizing...its an entire production with a film crew. The amount of planning makes this hard to believe Will actually said any of this and wasn't just reading what someone else wrote for him on a teleprompter.... like those questions he was reading.
Cant wait for this to be edited into memes
Peace and love everybody
Go take a walk will smith, delete this we don’t need this crap
ooo
You ain't sorry you did it. You sorry it backfired.
Ailesine sahip çıkmayan adamdan fayda gelmez. Eşine söylenenleri kabul edemedin. İnsani bir hareketti ve seni suçlamıyorum. Benim düşüncelerim bu şekilde. Sen sinema sektöründe en iyilerdensin ve öyle kalacaksın.
All the cynicism on here is pretty tiresome, ngl.  I'm sure he's legit sorry. Far worse things are happening every minute of every day.
This was one of the cringiest things I’ve ever seen
This just seemed so false and cheesy as an apology. Man started chuckling half way through like wtf is that about? Chris Deserves a better apology than this surely
I’m happy you be here and I hope you can going to see in any public places no matter! 🤟🏼♥️
How is this thing still going on? Kinda childish to be honest. What’s more interesting is his future in the industry and the political and economic state of the world right now.
Will had no choice but to apologize if he want to continue to live in the USA.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Get a woman who respects you cuh! That is not a healthy being
man if you ask me, chris deserved it. y’all treated will like a demon. don’t come with ya thinkpieces about comedy cause chris ain’t even funny at all, tyler james williams made him more funnier in my personal opinon
Get a better woman period
Now all he has to do is dance in a skin tight suit
Only took him 4 months. And he couldn't find a better excuse. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only took 4 months to apologise. So brave. Unreal
Should have held your ground and not apologized
He asked for space and that said he'll reach out if/when he's ready. You responded by forcing your apology onto him, his friends, his family, and everyone else in or out of his life with no obvious understanding of the boundary your friend (maybe) has put in place. This apology is well meaning, but it means nothing if you've failed to truly learn the lesson that is in front of you.
Too little, too late.
What did you get payed for doing the ritual
Hello , will we need jesus , the whole world need the jesus , personnaly i think that jesus need you to explain his love , when jesus full you self with his love you became another personn , try jesus men   I swear the best for the next , Jesus wait you brother
I am a 69 yr old great grandmother raising a 10 yr old. I’ve seen quite a few things in my life and would like you to know that you are important to us. You are a very nice man with excellent work. May the Lord richly bless you and your family👍
How do you forgive someone who isent sorry
Non devi chiedere scusa a nessuno, non è tutto lecito non è tutto giustificabile. Hai fatto bene a dargli il pizzone!
Uncle Phil would have been proud
Uncle Phil would be disappointed
actor being actor
I was so done with him after the incident, but this feels genuine to me and I appreciate that he made the effort in this manner instead of having a big, hyped interview with a celebrity interviewer. His apology to Chris' mom and Questlove made me tear up. I don't think he's acting; he's broken and trying to find a way to repair the situation and himself. We have to forgive others, if we expect to be forgiven. Good luck Will.
i wish i would see the dislike ratio.
I feel so bad 😭 but still what happened is not forgivable for some people :( When I was heard of the news that their will be an Aladdin 2 I was so excited but then what happened at the place the destroyed you carer theirs a less chance people want you to be in their movies. But in Aladdin you were the person that made it funny and cool but without you there really isn’t an Aladdin. You were also a big part of my childhood. Let’s hope the best for you ❤️
How many dislikes
When will we accept that celebrities are out of touch and raise the bar back up to normal standards of being a good human
Nope.
Is he acting like he can barely read too?
Whoever hasn’t sinned should throw the first stone. We love u Will.
One human being to another I understand Will.  I know how things can be in the moment and how you feel after once you have had time to think about how you could have done things differently. All we can do is apologize the best we can and learn from our mistakes. Your still one of my favorite actors and i believe your still a good person. This mistake does not tarnish my image of you. Keep doing your thing an i will continue to see every movie and watching positive thing you put into the world.  True winners learn from there mistakes an grow from them and to me your light will only get stronger from this experience.
I believe in 2nd chances but the thing is that anyone else would have been in court to pay for the mistake made. Once the court determined the crime and the individual paid for the mistake in our system, then anyone would  want to give a second chance to the individual.  None of this happened. Makes it a little harder to forgive.
Hehe boi
Talking about being concerned about being a light in the world and others when you can't even be honest with yourself is a non starter. This is too little, too late, and just shows that nothing has changed and the issues that caused this behavior in the first place haven't even been recognized. You don't owe anyone an explanation until you've been honest with yourself. And this verbiage ain't it. Sad to watch this slow train wreck continue down the track.
Much love, Will.💫  What a courageous step forward 👣  May this be a stepping stone toward wholeness, for you, Chris, & your respective families. 🙏🏼
Yaaaa, it's rewind time.
Well, my mom really needed this apology to happen, so good for you I guess
I feel you
10 out of 10 Apology video and that too just from 4 months of training is mad
You will be forgiven but not forgotten.
Logan Paul 2018 vibes
You fucked up man, you have to apologize you were definitely in the wrong here
Bros on number 1 trending 💀
it's disgusting... that's all
Will gona have to start playing the bad guy in movies and it ‘WILL’ be epic
It may be silly, but I find that this story made you human.. no longer an inaccessible star, but simply a man.. In my little part of France... you have all my support
It is a funny thing with a apologies. They don't really work when you are adult. At least he didn't use the "I am sorry you see it that way" line. The fact remains for at lot of people, including myself, that Will had cultivated a certain image of himself. This is shattered. I feel like I lost my childhood hero. Obviously he is still talented and can still do great things moving forward. It is just going to be different this time.
the time we are living in is by far the most hypocritical he has hurt himself the most it's enough now…love you Will
He apologized to save his career, nothing else.
I'm glad you're back Will, you're LOVED & MISSED! #teamwillsmith
Will Smith, continue to get better my brother. I hope 🙏 one day you and Chris can sit down and discuss the past issue ⚠️.
It’s all Her fault  why he is like this. But I don’t think he will ever admit that
We all make mistakes 🙏🏾  We will make more mistakes ❤  What matters is we do better 🥰 we learn *Some reason people like to see celebrities as not being human beings*  Will is not Hancock 🥴🧐🤔🙄😂
those louis tho , daaamn he got the drip even in a apology video
goofy ahh apology video
Lot's of hugs Will.
Run dude, go elsewhere and find yourself. Remember when you were a fun guy? Go to that place. On your own .
Wow another YouTube apology video.  Anyway,
BOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
If it takes you several months to apologize for something very obviously wrong that you did, then you aren't actually sorry at all.
Dear Will, we will always love you even when you get on our last nerves! We luv us some you!
He implied he has a history with Chris. Weird.
👑
It's ok
Look at all the perfect people judging another human being for simply apologizing for making a mistake; I'm sure none of these critics have EVER done something THEY had to apologize for... Should've just disabled the comment section Will. Everything will work out fine in the end though man, don't listen to these fools.
暴力は許されないが、言葉の暴力も許されるべきではない。クリスも謝罪すべきだ。
KEEP MY WIFE'S NAME OUTTA YOUR MOUTH
What do you guys think real or fake? Comment below
You’re a great man Will.  We all make mistakes, the key is to learn from them. Sounds like you have. ❤️
To be honest, after that moment my estimation of Will Smith did go down quite a bit, and it put a stain on all the good stuff that he said in the past, the speeches that are right here on YouTube about encouraging people to be their best selves and things like that, up until that moment Will Smith was always the “fun guy” in my mind, and I suppose that as much as it is on him, it is on me and I and a lot of people shouldn’t assume that Will Smith does not have a serious side. The forgiveness is there, Will, but people don’t easily forget, And you likely will forever be known as the “loose cannon” actor in Hollywood. Not the lighthearted “Will Smith”, but the “don’t make him angry” guy. I think my mother said it best when I was growing up “it is so much easier for people to remember the bad that you’ve done to them than the good.” She also said “just because something is hard doesn’t mean that it’s impossible.” This is Progress, Will, and I think I speak for everyone when I say…we appreciate the effort.
we are human we do mistake nobody is perfect and will never be part of being human learning of mistake and people everybody here done a mistake thw blessing his mistake might not be in air but still all of us keep doing mistake and the important to learn from it and learn how to change
Just talk aboyt financial problems.. be real while apologizing
I think it's a very good apology no matter what others say. Everyone made mistakes in their lives.
Sounds like Jesse smollet
bla bla bla apology video's are old good try though your actions have no excuse
Wow, I have never seen so many PERFECT PEOPLE in these comments  who have never made a mistake or have regrets before in my entire life !
Bro can we just talk about the political and economic state of the world right now
Lmao what an actual goober
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Time to apologize no work for anyone in family I'm so sorry but I felt like such a big shot at the time
There’s nothing to be sorry for man. You seem to always be the person people want to attack but you don’t owe anybody anything.
It hurts u financially that's y u r now apologizing
WELL DONE WILL SMITH 👏👏👏👏
Looks like uncle Phil still gotta discipline this boy
What an absolute jack wagon.
This reeks of "I just want this to go away", not real remorse.
Don't laugh while apologizing
I guess he needs to make money again asap
Although he might be remorseful and don't want to beat himself up in order to move on and live his life. The fact that Chris doesn't want to talk with him but Will and his management team still thought it was necessary to put out this "apology" video is embarrassingly showing why the rich and famous do what they do in order to be in the lime light.
H should apologize to the whope world
jaden thought it was the right thing to do 🤫
The odds r against u that’s y u r apologizing
No one is hiring u thats y u r now apologizing
Yeah u r apologizing now because the situation is pretty F up for u
Don't feel too bad, you created one of the memes of all time.
You cannot be remorseful without being ashamed of yourself.
We all make mistakes Will. Your mistake happened on global TV.  Considering the people involved and the place it happened, right or wrong, we expect better from our role models and public figures. I appreciate the heart felt apologies and hope that Chris and his family will too. I know you’re a good man and father. Imagine a world without forgiveness for people who truly seek it.  We love you Will.
U r not forgiven
Nice way to advertise his new book.
Ah-hah, it's rewind time!
well you tried ahaha
Who cares 🙄
I love you! ❤️ ty for being the man we all know you are. We all make mistakes. Be blessed Will.
Sorry Will I have lost all respect for you and so has a lot of the world ..go away for good . I took the few movies of yours that I had and tossed them in the garbage.
Can’t deal with the this bullshit PR work.  I enjoyed the Old Will....I don’t know why Will this is anymore
Nothing about this video seemed sincere. It was Will Smith trying to save his career. Period. Not buying it. And I would never waste a cent going to see any of his movies.
Ya so focused on how long it took  to make this apology 😒 like everyone has the same mental health that will allow them to deal with situations the second they happen   Be satisfied that he took the time at all cause there are plenty of situations where celebrities don't even address them at all and pretend nothing happened   Thank you Will for even doing this
Everyone, every single one of us has that breaking point, even you who is reading this comment and none of us have the right to judge Will for that single moment.  Great to hear from you Will, power on man, you are loved ❤
He’s gonna get nominated again for that performance!!!! Hahahahaaaaaa
As soon as someone uploads an apology vid, you know it's for damage control
I didn't watch ur video yet,   Still,  U ENDED URSELF FOR SOME WHO DOESN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just say “sorry” to Chris my guy!
His arrogance still seeps out. Answering the question about apologizing during his acceptance speak was a no brainer - he should have addressed it by saying he SHOULD HAVE. Instead he tosses bs flimsy af excuses. When he starts doing things in the community to make up for his actions, that will be more of an indicator.
So happy he apologised. Sometimes we make mistakes in life that doesn’t define us. But we move and learn. I can see his remorse. I hope Chris and him are able to move forward from this and Will is able to continue his career as a great actor ❤️🙏.
Now this was a whole lot of nothing. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Will doesn't know how to apologize clearly just looking at this...but I can tell it's cuz it's so much to register in his head. Will Smith you are my favorite actor since I was a kid. You've been in amazing movies especially my favorite is pursuit of happiness. You messed up yes...but I did too in my personal life and I try to do better. If you're reading this, just know we wish to see the Will Smitjh back from the 90s and 2000s. Why we really loved you. If your future is forever going to change, I'll always remember those movies you've been in. Always my favorite actor. At least you're not a criminal
Remember that time when you bungee jumped on a helicopter then didn't even credit yes theory for that challenge in your video? I remember.
everyone makes mistakes in life you will remain an example because you made far fewer mistakes than the other little messages from Morocco 😉  ￼
Love you Will
There's my thumbs down.  Must be mental health. What  bullshit
Wow, what a heartfelt and convincing apology, that must’ve taken multiple takes!
He will always be my fav actor but not fav person from what happened. We all make a mistake once or more in life. Like the wise said, 3 things that are unredeemable; words, opportunity, and action. Will messed up big times and only time will heal
Cocaine apology speech
It was really not that big of a deal.  People should realize this incident , a: has nothing to do with 'us'.  It's between him and CR.  And b: it's not such an 'earth shattering' event.  He fucked up.  Spectacularly, yes.  But not in any real, lasting way.  I'll finish up with a 'LIGHTEN UP, FRANCIS' for everyone who isn't WS &CR who think they were hurt by, or involved in, this incident.
I bet some of Jada's boyfriends helped him write this
I know you have a sweet spirit. I will always love my Big Will. Things happen! You are human. If people would think; what if the shoe was on the other foot.
I look forward to the future where we can strike someone who says something we don't like...
I'm surprised by how cold people are in these comments. It's important for people to apologise sincerely. And for people to believe them. That's how the world becomes better. People should be allowed to grow and change. And for this to happen to public figures, we should all have learnt a collective lesson.
It was out of character for you, I appreciate your candor and am still a fan.
that’s gotta be the worst place to keep Jada’s crystal ball
This bullshit apology is to little to late
"YUUUHHHH, THATS HOT!"  -some guy in cringe youtube rewind
First the rewind time meme and now this
sill with
To forgive is not for us to do but Chris equally crossed a line.  Maybe i would have dealt with it differently, maybe, I would not have.  It takes a tonne of courage to apologize for our actions.  However, I must say, Chris needs to dive equally deep into his actions.  Not taking your side, nor his.  Your apology is much needed, for him.  But he equally owes, and apology and it only means anything if he comes from his own truth.  This is not about comparisons but reality on the ground - wrong was replied to with wrong.   BOTH parties need to take ownership of their actions.
whys he sound like hes being forced to do this at gun point
Divine love to you
Fellows who watched The Boys, The Deep, anyone?🤣🤣
Public Relations team to Will -  Let the people hear you sadly sigh before you do your fake apology to Chris. This will help save your career.
"Trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself." That's a word right there. As a HSP and a shame-sensitive person, I really felt that.
beta af
Wow.   Nothing says your quite like a man like waiting 4 months  to work up an apology.   Too Jones!
i forgive you big willy
isnt it a bit early to apologize?
no its been longer than a minute.

Screw Chris!! Much love will!!!
He went on to make a speech about Chris being a devil that's trying to pull him down on the night. Today it's an apology. lol
God bless you Chris! Yes, you are human. We all make mistakes. I’ve been there too. Keep doing your work and be compassionate with yourself and others.
Pockets are feeling that night.. its now time to apologize 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ your still my favorite person in this world tho 🙂
Only if we could see the dislike count
Still love you! ❤️
Its rewind time
Wait this is still going?
Will Smith is so fake. You apologize in private. PR stunt and poor apology too. Chris owes you nothing.
Sincere apology, Will. Much love, ma guy! But, the timing though. Couple months late, don’t ya think? Better then no apology, I guess.
We are human and because of this, we are flawed. No matter how hard we try, we make mistakes. Including making the wrong decisions under pressure. We have all done so at one level or another. What you did to Chris on stage was a wrong decision, as you know. It is what you do after that decision that shows who you are. Chris will find his time to speak with you and the healing will continue. You are both very talented and outstanding people and I hope your two find that peace.
Hey man, we all make mistakes. That's what makes us human. No one is perfect.
Will went from being a funny, chill guy, just trying to make it - to eventually making it and then that success getting to his head and having him on some "superhuman" "chosen one" type sh!t - and surrounded himself with yes men since then, always experiencing adoration and feeling absolute disdain for anyone that would ever go against the grain of what he thought. Thus, causing him to feel a sense of uncontrolled anger the moment anyone did or said something he didn't like. That was where he veered off. I feel like this was a situation that needed to happen to bring him back down to Earth and peg him back a bit - hopefully he can be a better man for it.
This doesn’t deserve to be on trending🙄
D'AAAHHH.... ITS REWIND TIME
Back in the 90s, I was in a very famous TV show.
This felt very much like a youtuber/streamer apology video, which is weird coming rom Will Smith. But at the very least, he did more than 95% of all apology videos by apologizing for his actions rather than how people took his actions. Most of the time people say things like "im sorry you felt hurt" or "i'm sorry you got upset", etc, and deflect responsibility. At least he owned it.
Personally, I forgive him.
*Title conversation* - We want sincere but in a Fresh Prince tone so everyone remembers a time when Will was loved.  - It’s been a minute? - Good - a touch more sincere tho - Add dot dot dot - Perfect.
Idk why , you are no more a hero to me        :(
Wow. Now that you realize your career is over you apologize. SMH.
We love you Will ❤
Nailed the youtuber apology!!! 👍👍👍
Why wait so long to apologize to the man if you weren't just trying to save the career?
Bro really made a youtube apology video💀💀💀
Looking at the comment section, humans smh we done lost empathy, what Will did was wrong , but we can’t keep slandering him over one mistake , how many mistakes have you done this month ? This week ?
This is just a publicity stunt.
Oh look at all this APOLOGIST experts. Like none of you had made a mistake. Will never been in a major drama or anything.  Made a huge mistake and all you want to sacrifice him, right now he is growing and learning from his mistake. Xo
Fake sake, give the guy a break!
Imagine if dislikes still exist
And... what’s the point of this video? It happened ages ago, and I don’t think people care anymore.
I can guarantee you that everything about this video was rehearsed and planned perfectly for Will Smith to come off as "a human who made a mistake". Everything down to the timing of this video's release. I bet you that Smith had analysts work through when people would be the most forgiving and that is when everything about the incident has died down.
Ok idc honestly lol
Will Smith: _Sigh_
In the tier list of youtuber apologise you get a B tier. Only thing stopping this being an A tier is the fact it’s late and the lack of “I’m sorry” to Chris. But you still feel sincere which means either you are or I fell for your acting.
Public apologies are meant for, well, PR. You could have reached out privately without all this buzz. Just saying.
Good to see you back Will!
I can't even see you anymore.
Its ok will u are sorry my guy
♥
Whoa already!?
10 mill on the way
I thinking what do you do when are no cameras...
Another crappy apology video😒
Your audience loves you Will, mistakes happen and you are remorseful and that’s what’s important. Chris needs his time and that is alright too, he didn’t press charges for a reason, he’ll come around! Love and light to you!!!
took 3 months to act this out. fake fake fake
He left comments on?  He left comments ON?  I don't have time to read this!  But I'm gonna!
BYE FELICIA!
Travis Scott’s apology was better 😂🤣
Nah, this isn’t ok. You reached out, knew he wasn’t ready to talk to you, so you come make a public YouTube video KNOWING damn well this will bring it all back up and shove Chris back into the spotlight everyone asking him how he feels about your apology. This is about saving YOUR face, not apologizing to Chris.
I miss you and forgive you will
Pretty mediocre apology, even worse it took this long to happen. Just when people were forgetting about it. That's the problem with celebrities, they can't stand being out of the limelight
lmao didnt know it was that deep
Humans make mistakes. Nor he or us are angels. He made a mistake. He got humbled at the peak of his life. He should apologize to Chris and learn from this and we should forget about this incident.
It's ok Will "I" forgive you.
I guess if you are Very Rich, talented and privileged, you still hope to get away with  crimes that the rest of us would be in handcuffs for... What not enough witnesses to prosecute. Nothing has changed. #Freedom_of_speech
just saying should've done this earlier
the moment you'll be remembered for
Will world is like this  happy and sad face, now u  r at happy phase.  Thank u God!
Let her go...
NOPE
it’s not up to US to accpect will’s apology or not. this is ment for chris’s family and himself to either accpect will’s apology if what hes saying in the video is enough to be forgiven.
If I could control rewind I would want Fortnite and Marques Brownlee
4 months late buddy
The crying effects are so ‘90s. People haven’t bought into that for years.
Full support to you Will. I wish all the very best.
Don't worry KING, we love ya 4ever❤️❤️
Being in LOVE with someone knowing that she dont LOVE you the same way, have to be so painfull
Would love to see the dislikes on this thing if YouTube still had that 'feature'
Is anyone else looking at the recent comments
I can’t even watch this after he sighed
That isn't Billie elish
Its been a while. Why did ppl feel the need to change the phrase to its been a minute?
you're not a calculator Will, you just reacted with your heart, impulsively. at your level it can be expensive. but you're not a bad guy
its been months
It’s rewind time

3 months late
You showed us the real you, and now you want us to forget what we all saw.
We all know you are the real victim here Will! Lmao at least that's what you want us to believe....
How much will, will a will smith smith, if a will smith will smith will?  A will smith will smith as much will as a will smith will, if a will smith will smith will.
The guy placed his WATER brand in the video. Clearly his head was focused on his business. He knows this video would gain viewership and felt placing that water bottle would help expose the brand.  Will SHAME on you
too little too late ...
Penguinz0 got these comments down to a T
I appreciate Will speaking about this and taking ownership of his behavior..i love it . A lot ppl would’ve even apologize. Grown man ish
"He who is free of sin..." The guy did what everybody has done: he f***ed up! He's hardly Goebbels here, is he?

You followed your wife’s command and eventually she also kicked you out of her life. She’s just vile and mean and you followed that woman as if you don’t have a mind of your own. She may be the love of your life but she shouldn’t have acted that way. For the longest time you have been a mere facade for her. She was and will always be manipulative.

Been a fan of Will since I was young (51 now).  As he said, he was wrong, What he did was a shock, sadly he will always be remembered for this and not the six million other cool things he has done.   Let’s hope they make up one day and the world can see that people can forgive and be friends.  Good luck to them both ❤️
"keep my wife's name outta your ------ing mouth"  🤡😂😂😂🤣
Brother you look after you & yours. Nothing but love & support from me.
He is human. People make mistakes. He acted out of emotions, leave him alone.
It’s sad that people can’t be human. He made a bad decision like all of us at some point in life have done. Keep going Will 💪🏽
As long as Jada's many boyfriends forgives Will, then we do too.
"It's all fuzzy"    i gonna use that excuse for everything now - "hey officer!  i didn't know i was speeding, it's all fuzzy"
We all make mistake brother. It is good hear sir, as a fan I was disappointed too. Finally I am able to hear what I am expecting from someone I know as will smith.  Whether chris would accept that apology or not, or hollywood accept you or not, at least you are able to make peace for yourself. Prepare to face the truth. Good luck Sir. Be happy, we all deserve second chances at happiness. 👊👍

its definitely a strange thing and you definitely over reacted but its not a huge deal and i dont think everyone should care this much because its between you and chris

#ExposeWillSmithChildSacrifices
Pac woulda done worse
Watching this video I'm reminded of the great Mr. Burns when he made a video for the awards show he said....We did 20 takes and that was the best one.
Bruh momento
Within the first 30 seconds in the video, they're already promoting "JUST Water" AKA their business before even apologizing. Pathetic.
To Will Smith, I’m disappointed for what you did but at the end of the day we all human. Learn from your mistakes and focus on you and your family.
Hei.. what wrong
Go away will.
At 2:58 what the hell is that and how did he recover so quickly from that "tears choke?" Serial killers do the same. And liars.
I assume this video is monetized.
If Chris doesn’t forgive Will, it’s because Chris can detect B.S. good distraction from the war and high gas prices.
Chris has to forgive him and not some Fans in the commentar section.
I love how he's still promoting his son's water in this apology video. shameless plug indeed
Why did Will go to the after party?
Its funny, world leaders are resigning, celebrities protection is dropping from the elite and liberal leftist politicians, More important question would be; *Why do you continue to serve an illuminati agenda?* how about *adrenochrome* and *are you a war criminal against the people?* You have only earned blood money, probably participated in child sacrifices and if you have you should go to jail or worse, receive the death penalty!.
We love u will. My whole family stands with you.
Maybe I've been watching too many YouTubers apologize. The setting alive screams set up. And that water bottle 🙄 he can't go for 5 minutes without sipping water?
Nothing better than a YouTube apology

Who is this?
Keep your head up. No one is perfect. Now the world realizes Will Smith is a mortal human being. That should take some of the pressure off of you. You don't have to do something great and wonderful to make up anything to anyone. Just do you. There is no way in hell I would ever choose to be famous. It has to be the hardest and loneliest life there is. I didn't use to think that way when I was young. I salute you in how well you've handled all the pressures for so many years. Everyone has a "Come Apart" at some moment in life. Yours just happened to be very public. Everyone still loves you. I realize its not easy but learn from your mistake and move forward buddy! Your going to be fine!
This really just smacks of someone desperate to save their career. He sees the writing on the wall and knows that he doesn't have the draw respect that he once did, even though he may not have deserved it in the first place.   I know I can speak personally and say that I have no further interest in his body of work, past, present or future.
Guys like if that was super Sus like among us!! 📮📮📮  👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼
My guy actually sighed
We all need forgiveness for something. ❤️
Even Will has to fight against laughing when he said he did something on his own will 😂😂
"Take my apology or I'm gonna tell the whole world you won't take my apology."  Over reaction seems to be a theme here.

I don’t understand why people even make apology videos in the first place. It’s not like people are ever actually gonna accept it anyway. I don’t think I have ever seen a single apology video where people don’t mock the creator in the comments. You can’t really expect much more than that on the internet. Will is only human, and humans make mistakes all the time, and I think people really need to realize that
There it is. The dramatic entrance, the *sight* while sitting down… classic YouTube stuff.   And then the arrogance of thinking we needed this, an apology from the great and mighty Will Smith. Why does he think he is more relevant than the rest of us. Because he clearly believes he does otherwise he would’ve have made this cringe video.
That product placement tho.
I also want him to apologize for being apologetic.
ratio
an apology shouldn't be 5 minutes long
His wife’s White boyfriend is happy that he made this video
hi will
It's always the first step that is the hardest....keep working through it! Much love
Reaching out to him through YouTube, so classy Will. Publicity stunt at its finest. Media/public sympathy for you and all eyes on Chris to respond. Bravo, this would save your career.

I’m convinced we live in a simulation
Your an amazing person and honestly as long as u have come to terms and responsibilities in your actions that's all that matters . People make mistakes and act before thinking .that's what makes us human people can say we forgive and lol that jazz but as long as u forgive yourself for your actions that's all that matters . Time will heal all things . I'll always be a fan now and forever . Never stop believing in yourself and as far as not disappointing people only worry about you and your kids . And those closest to u we fans will get over it like us fans never made a mistake . It ain't right but time will pass . Your amazing and I wish u all the best . I only wish to meet u one day but even if I don't your always in my prayers
“I’m sorry, I lost my temper" should have been enough not a whole video explaining your whole life
Lmfao

Oh Lawd. What a mess
It takes a real man of character to admit he was wrong. Men are wired to rise to the call of duty. Although not the best results here, a man’s reaction often of bears a heavy hand. #strongwill
What about the tweet "That's how we do it"
KEEP MY WIFES NAME OUT YO FUCKIN MOUTH
He should of started with this line"Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down"
If I was Chris I wouldn’t  forgive you
Where's the dog? T_T
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏾🙏🏾 bless you our community needed this hope you heal
Lol
Get help.

He did it to look like a big man protecting his woman. It backfired and now he’s in trouble. He doesn’t care about “the impact it had on people”. He’s just trying to salvage his career now.

"I want to apologize" is not the same as "I'm sorry.

Be ashamed bro .
Bruh, how we go from “yaaaaaa, its rewind time” to the literal perfect youtuber apology video
Is That It!?
Nice product placement!
Fake, fake ,fake 🤣🤣🤣🤣
no dude, the damage has been done.
WS literally “shares” EVERYTHING “elsejada” in his life why not the spotjadalight? 🤣
Will Smith  LEGEND FOREVER  💖🌟🥇😍
Aaaaaand CUT! Good Job Will, this will make the world forgive you.
Will, we make mistakes, we learn, we grow. The complexity of human being is beautiful. Welcome back!
Good job
Still waiting for RDC to make this video
he's just trying to save face  and stop harassment on his family .....he got a big reaction and was banned from the attending the golden globe awards for ten years ....there nothing complex ...you threw an overly reacted hissy fit ...and you been in Hollywood for a long time sooooo you got comfortable with having a voice and thinking you can do something like this and be ok.  I am not impressed with your sorry ....waiting as long as you did and your sorry seems very unemotional like your giving a speech on how you hurt people but ...your an actor so how can we know if your being 100% real or using the words you think your fans and haters want to hear . I never really liked Will smith.
Shake my head.
Wouldnt have apologized if he wasnt hurting his career. Completely insincere
Fair play yo - hopefully we can all move on - you’re a great man who made a mistake xxx
How cringe apology videos are I respect that he’s done thinking and he’s realised what he’s done wrong. Here’s to the future 🍻
You can see he's reading the autocue.
What Will did was wrong, but you can't go back in time and change it. You only have one option, move forward. And this seems like an adult way of trying to amend damage and open himself up to reality, which is he is the one who made a mistake here. Considering this is his (and our) only option when something like this happens, I think this was an intelligent, grown up way to respond.
I think will Smith do the correct  thing in that moment ...
This is definitely one of the YouTube videos of all time
i gotta say, all the words sound good, but it is a cpuple months too late
💙💙💙💙💙 Love and Light Always 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Thanks for every oll love you 💓
😂😂😂😂
Love how everyone else cant take an apology video seriously because of the way its represented or interpreted
Perfect YouTube apology keep up the great work will can’t wait for more trash content
Will Smith can, and chooses to do, the right thing.  Thank you, Will Smith, for continuing to set a good example for grown ups at a time when even our heads of state break the law to serve themselves.
Pretty sure we'll see a scene mocking this in The Boys S4
AAAHHHHH... That's hot! That's hot...
The man apologized. It's on Chris now. It's past time to move on from this stuff. Everyone who ran here to bash this dude must be very miserable.
You're lucky the dislike button is hidden old man

Apology accepted if you give me the Fresh Emote in Fortnite

"That's hot" - will smith
Is it possible to even quantize the amount of hubris and ego that went into crafting this video. I wonder how many people worked around the clock checking and double checking every word he would say rehearsing it time and time again until he had it perfect and they can make it look like it was one take and from the heart. This is all a sham the only thing he's concerned with is his cash flow and staying liquid. Should already have more money than he'll ever need and hopefully he will continue to go away.  Edit: I am gratified to see that the vast majority of the public sees right through this nonsense. This is obviously a staged and choreograph video and there's absolutely nothing genuine about it. It really is a shame. I don't count myself as a large fan of Will Smith but I have nothing against him however this entire incident has alerted me to a lot about him and the environment that surrounds him. I wouldn't want any of these people anywhere near my life or people I care about. It's just mind-numbing to me how idiotically self-centered this entire family seems to be. I guess it is certain level of power and fame there's just no one that can talk since to you and you are left to dig your own pit to hell
This is one of the apology videos of all time
Love you Will ❤️❤️❤️ Happy you finally apologized to Chris, he deserves it! The image I had of you never changed but I did find it wrong what you did and I'm happy you finally did what you were supposed to do! Hope Chris will forgive you, if he doesn't, AT least you apologized!

What sucks for him is that no matter what he does, it's going to be scrutinized and criticized by everyone. Whether it be a YouTube vid, interview with a reporter, audio recording, whatever. And since he's an actor, people will claim he's lying, like most of the comments here I've seen. I hope he can find solace and be able to move on in peace.  There are other celebrities that have done much worse, 🙄 *Ezra Miller*😒, that haven't had nearly the same lash back.

Still time to delete this
I was shaking and crying when Will Smith said, “It’s Rewindin’ Time.” Truly an apology of all time.
Hey, Will. Miss you, man. It's up to Chris and hope that both of you will become friends again.
he’s doing the mature thing, he could’ve done it sooner but sometimes it takes time, so respect man, hopefully it works out for everyone involved in the situation
hope y’all successful in life
Didn't need to do this. Chris was the only one he needed to apologize to, and whether Chris accepts it is up to him. This is just bowing to the social media mobs, and they don't need to be answered to like you've been some naughty school child.
There appears to be something very very odd about the smith family that doesn't quite seem right. Maybe it's just media coverage tbhf but the coverage that comes out is just weird....like do they even like each other sorta vibe. As I said could be the media
Nice to see you. Keep going, it must feel like a never ending journey, perhaps it isn’t but you have the love and support you need no matter what💕
I would definitely want him to say what he wants, double down and keep his wife's name out your mouth
i personally think he handled it well.
You're a top man Will.. you had a split second to react in one way or another,  life in the public eye as a chief isn't easy. 👍👍
Dude you can be sorry and that's fine, but we know what you are now. You gotta work on improving yourself.

Bad Apology. Didn’t talk about the Political and Economic state of the world right now.
Am I the only one who feels like this isn’t actually an insincere apology?
I would have more respect if you actually stood by your actions. I think to apologise in this instance is pathetic.
A very heartful apology to everyone except Chris.
We forgive you Will. We love you.
Will Smith should have erased the crowds memory.

Good stuff, the sooner this is over the better. Will Smith is one of the best actors Hollywood has ever seen, he needs to be doing his magic on screen asap!
Now this is a story all about how my life got twist turned upside down
been hanging out with zucc too much "im human"
The telenovela continues...
Can't believe he put product placement in an apology video 🤣
If he’s expressed to you already that he’s not ready to talk then you are not doing this for him you’re saving face for publicity and for yourself.
who is controlling will, he talks like someone is aiming at him.
Despicable.
Why is he even doing this now? It's been like four months, no one cares. The world has bigger issues than some multimillionaire celebrity delivering knuckle sandwiches
He still thinks it was insult and disrespect. He doesn't get it.
Will Smith out here looking like he's gonna compete in the local golf competition.
3 months later is too late, this should have been the next day.
There's a question I keep asking myself over and over again in my head, and someone needs to address said question to Will...  What would James Avery have to say about all this?
Ohh Jesus Christ ❤️🙏when are you gonna  do your next movie I can't wait 😁❤️ My Dearest Friend ❤️
It’s 4 months too late but I’m glad Will finally addressed it.
That's what doing the self work looks like cause I believed that apology. It doesn't have to be accepted by the injuries parties, but he looks and sounds like someone who wants to be better for himself and everybody. Good luck to him and those who have to heal up also after this. Love to QuestLove, his documentary was a triumph!
nah
it's sad to see such a praised and welcome celebrity fall off like this. first with all of the weird family dramas/controversies and now this niche youtube apology video
You need your freedom Will...
Very sick and self-absorbed person. The white globe behind his head is also ridiculous and the “love” poster out of step, a non sequiter. Lots of words and saying nothing.
why are y’all mad at him? this guys a legend
Very few adults have to truly deal with themselves. It’s clear you are Will & we have you in prayer on this journey that so few don’t have the courage to travel.
Ur a funny man mr man in black
There’s gotta be a place somewhere in the video where he could insert a  “Aww that’s hot, that’s hot”
???
Damn, an 80, 000 to zero dislike ratio this apology video must be great!
no se ingles
Will, we are with you .true friends stay together in all times. Sending you much love🤍
There's a difference between saying, "I apologize"... and saying the words... "I'm sorry!"... Didn't even make it to the end of this BS video.... WTF happened to you Will?? At this stage you're just making it worse for yourself... Still laughing... Still not taking responsibility... Just BS.... Anyway... I've had enough... I'm outta here
Nah Bro.  I’m good. This is to promote your new projects.  Keep acting .
Is this how he normally speaks?? So slow i can't wait lol
Lol
And you needed to think for months on this?!?! Boy, stop shoveling.
LOSE THIS CREEP.
"this oughta make all this go away and sell some of my water"
This ain’t it fam..
For all the people saying this is just for his career and a pr boost y'all must not know will well enough. Will smith has spent his ENTIRE LIFE trying to make people happy and bring positivity into the world. He has been someone to look up to that cares about pleasing others. Will smith has only shown us that he's human and he makes mistakes. EVERYONE will make a terrible mistake in their life. Just because will did doesn't mean he's a monster or that he all of a sudden only cares about his career. Will Smith has always been a positive and humble person to look up to and he's demonstrated it countless times so why is everyone focused on the 1 bad thing instead of the countless great things will's done.
"Was that Will Smith?" 😂
You are so sorry that you had to put your son's brand right next to you. talk about product placement.
Mr Will I hope you get a chance to read this comment here I know you're very busy man but you are a beautiful human being and this could have happened to any of us we are all  human and you should know we all love you man the world loves you and the great work you always do we all can't wait to see your next movie everyone's still rooting for your brother keep doing what you're doing this to shall pass it is what it is these things happen and it could have happened to any one of us and it really was not fair for you to be treated in a manner especially when not knowing all the facts to a situation there is always another side to what you experienced  but things happen in life bro but you're still an awesome and extremely stud of a man and we can't wait to see your up and coming movies looking forward to all of them brother so excited for you and the things you're going to do in the future man take care and God bless  🙏
if he's not ready to talk, don't put this up here for the entire public to see instead. This is not a class act.
No no no no no no no.
What a load of rubbish your talking I didn’t mean to do it etc and your actions yet your wasn’t a man to think before you acted
That Just Water product placement…
What you actually meant to say is that you're sorry for yourself. The world did mostly forget about you and move on. Let's not kid ourselves, what you did is not the worst humanity has ever seen but they'll act like it is. Chris's response is proof of that. Also your apology video feels forced, we don't need your apology, Chris does, we don't really care. Does not feel genuine with a video with a production value of a blockbuster movie and water placed on the table like an ad placement.
lmao
If you are not ashamed of yourself, this is not an apology but a hollow  PR exercise. Your ego has grown so big, it's sad to see.
Seems to me like “I want my career back speech”
I give this YouTuber apology a 7/10, could use more guilt tripping and silent pauses.
All Respect Will. nobody is perfect in life. we all as humans make mistakes. I'm here as a fan since Fresh Prince and still going strong. Love and Respect 🙏
We can all talk about whether he is actually sorry and is sincere about his apology or he is actually performing. In the end, it’s just our opinion. He only knows if he is sincere with his apology. There are moments in life especially when you’ve risen to certain heights and these things have to happen for you to realize that you are human after all and what a humbling experience. I personally wasn’t disappointed because what he did, i was only disappointed because of where it happened. I can’t even begin to imagine what Will and Chris are going through mentally. Let’s stop being judgmental and putting up this “ holier than thou” attitude because some of us have than worse. PS: Will, I can’t wait for you to recount this incident in your book when you update it. What was going through your mind, why you did what you did and you felt afterwards. Man that will be interesting. Love you man
did you work with a bunch of canceled youtubers to make this apology?
Big Willy, this will never leave you. You done a big silly.
We have an expression in Australia "What an wan***"
I forgive him, easily haha  Not a very bad thing to happen imo like Chris seemed fine after it just makes will look bad
This is all so fake He is just doing this to save his public image
*It’s rewind time.*
Woke at 4am and understood we all make mistakes
Love to have you back brother
This is where we are at? Why should we even care about some famous dudes life? Lol super funny to laugh at. In the sense of his "girl" really ain't with him and totally disregards his love.
You were obviously hurting, we all know you've got a good heart Will. peace.
Bro perfected every YouTube apology video ever
After so many months. Don’t you think It’s a little too late…..
Think It, Dream It, Do It
It’s hard for me to take an apology with cameras that move cinematically and have a set made seriously.
you should be in jail
Wow it took him quite a while to realize
Its just in the heat of the moment
Sending Love and prayers 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Cringey generic YouTube apology 😂
Imo, i feel like he put this on YouTube to get forgiveness from “the people”  instead of Chris. This situation has been going on for too long now and it should be settled off camera.
I honestly think this is something that is unforgivable. Just the actual details of everything that happened after it at the awards show is just horrendous. The way everybody treated Chris is a reflection on the actual decay of society today. Everybody treated him like crap. So I see Will Smith apologizing to the academy but I don't see anybody else apologize. Did anybody from the set or did any actors go to him to comfort him? Did that happen? Maybe I missed it. But anyway what happened to Chris is disgusting on every level. On a positive note the degree of professionalism in which Chris conducted himself is inspirational. He was treated like crap by everybody but he did his job. In light of Chris' conduct after all of this I would like to add that he is indeed a gentleman.  For Will directly dude it's just unforgivable. But don't let this mistake dim your light one bit. If shining on other people is what you want to do, you have it in you. There's just nothing about this that's fixable. I see this is made you better. Let's all just pray for Chris on this one.
Hi, smith. I'm glad you decided to settle this down. Keep up the good work, brother.
Classic.
Apology on YouTube?!?! But why? To save the brand Will Smith! Because he's surrounded by people who make money for Will and with him. It's about maintaing the brand
Thanks for reaching out to us, Will. It can’t have been easy with everybody having such a great time attacking you. The important thing to note here is that those same people make mistakes that are so much more hurtful and destructive. The difference being, those mistakes are not available for millions to analyse and judge. For all we know, behind closed doors, there's quite a few people that should be apologizing to you.   Your phenomenal career is not in any way less important, inspiring, or deserving of respect.   It’s time for everybody to move on.
Where's your dominating martian alien
There is a great shortage of real men in our era, we really cant condemn one of our best male over one mistake, it was indeed humiliating to Chris, but i know at some point Chris will accept this apology,  these two men are my heroes and i love them both and i do wish they sort out things.
I cannot decide whether I like this apology, or don't.
The rapper that didn't have to "cuss in his raps to sell records" turned out to be more volatile than those who did...

Do you serv the deep state ??? Are you for the new world order ??? Do you stand with the pepole ? Or have you sold out to the agenda 2030?? We will not forget who was helping the new world order ......tick tock the truth will run up the clock !
This is just PR damage control stunts. Simple question is why wait months for just an apology??? Sorry but i am not buying it one bit.
I forget that this was just 4 months ago.
Anybody see that very lame, yet somehow highly-curated, insincere apology video?  I guess it took about 4 months to get through reshoots and post-production.
I think he deserves the second chance, After all the good memories  he made for us
I love you ❤️❤️❤️
I can tell that Will spent those four months studying other youtube apology videos so that he could craft the perfect apology video.
He’s just promoting his book lol
Good to hear it officially respect To Chris For holding On hope he forgive you
You let down  the entire  world  people  were looking  up to you you showed what drunk  people  do and indeed  it very  late sorry  what took  so long  to apologise  you took everything  for granted  it took  you 3months  if iam Chris it would  take 30yrs to talk to you   you really  really  really  let people  down  my 18 years  son was unhappy  you did that to chris
Good to hear it officially respect To Chris For holding On hope he forgive you
Just a simple “I’m sorry Chris” sheepishly said like when your mummy made you say might even suffice. I’m sorry actually goes further than you know. Someone can trip you in the street and you fall and just keep going. Somebody else can help you up and apologise for that since they didn’t do it. “I’m sorry” takes personal responsibility for doing something, that’s why lawyers never let their clients use this phrase because you’re accepting personal liability. That’s why it takes all the guts it does to say. And don’t worry, you’re in good company, most of us find it hard too.
Is this the worst acting performance in his entire career?
We all forgot about this, stop trying to stay relevant
Do it while hugging a dog, Will. It will makes the apology feel more genuine.
As always Will… well said… and good luck with your personal self growth journey
Go on andrew tate podcast he will help you
Dan Bongino always said that the left would eventually eat each other.
Every one make mistakes!!..we learn from it... and move on!
🌹🌹🌹🙏🙏🙏
This seems to be an exercise in public relations. Why post this? He should be reaching out privately to the people he needs to apologize to.
Leave ur damn wife…u will become a happy man
Will......All you needed to do was say..  "I am sorry bro, from the bottom of my heart.  I lost my cool, I lost my temper, and I am sorry."   THAT'S IT!
3:33  Rise, Tarnished
2:45... and that's all he really wanted to clear up. Still dancing in her palm it seems. "Nothing to do with her" yet the initial laugh was caught in 4k and you held hands with her throughout the remainder of the ceremony 🙄
So...........when is the announcement for your next movie
Can't wait for the behavioral analysts to analyze this.
I forgive you Will.
He a human. We all make mistakes. But Will's was on the world stage, something most of us don't have to worry about. The positive is that because of this, Will has to face up to and deal with a lot more reprocussions and therefore, learn a great deal more from this than most. This will only help Will grow and become a better person.
Tbh I really thought it was funny 🤣 but I have always looked up to Will and he's doing the right thing so everyone give him some slack, this is between Will and Chris
So much negativity in the comments. A lot of you wouldn’t have the balls to apologize to someone you’ve done wrong! He’s HUMAN! Noncelebrity folk always speaking so highly from their pedestal like they haven’t been in a situation where they’ve been at fault. Ugh, it’s disgusting honestly.
I love your work Will and even though I was shocked when you did what you did I fully understand that it was the heat of the moment that made you do it and I'm happy to see you admit doing this was wrong and that you are reaching out to Chris to make amends. I do hope that Chris sees it the same way and can forgive you for what happenend that day so you can both leave it behind and move on without being haunted by this memory.  Just know that your fans will always love you and support you even though bad things happen from time to time. In the end we are all humans and we make mistakes. As long as you can see that you where wrong and are willing to apologize everything will be alright
It's been 4 months*
I wanna see the deleted scenes. 😂
Wow, what a heartfelt and convincing apology, that must’ve taken multiple takes!
everyone in this comment section putting they heart and soul into these comments just for them all to say the same thing 💀
youtuber apology 101, even that long sigh at the beginning
First off, bad background, weird yellow opaque circle in vicinity of his white hat.
I was angry with him just like everyone else. He had let me down. Big time! I do think it's mostly for Chris to accept the apology. I also do think that Will deserves a chance to emerge a better man after his stupid mistake. The world is broken. Love is the cure.
God's grace to you, Will. I have been a fan of both you and Chris for ages. I pray you reconcile. Humans are fallible. I think what you did to Chris was wrong, but I see and appreciate what looks like a genuine apology. Love to both of you.

Why not just apologize to Chris privately and keep it at that?
Apologising is a positive step forward. You are right, we are all human. Is it regrettable that happened? yes, was it wrong? yes, should you spend forever thinking you are as you put it a piece of sh*t? no of course not. You're not a piece of sh*t dude, you know that, we know that. You're just a guy who did a really silly thing and you're sorry and no doubt will learn from this experience. If you learn nothing from an experience like that, then the moment is lost on you. But it sounds like you are learning and growing a lot from this particular mistake and that's ok. End of the day only Chris can really decide whether he forgives you or not as that's up to him, we don't get to decide that, but I am glad that you have come out to say this. First positive step forward. Go easy on yourself, mental illness effects everyone, even those who lash out in error. You're ok. Just remind yourself of that. You're ok. Tomorrow is a new day. And we're going forward. One step at a time. Peace.
A generic youtube apology video. And just like all other youtube apology videos, this one also has more dislikes than likes.
4 months and all those jobs have still dried up, time to apologise 💀💀
Nicely placed poster, Will. Not obvious at all. 😏 My lord.  "I, I, I, I, me, me, me, me, blah, blah, blah"...." "I am remorseful." ??? Wtf?
Who actually uses language like this in real life? It's just contrived, embarrassing drivel.
Somos humanos, logo estamos sujeitos a erros. Errou, pediu desculpas 👏🏽 Agora, é bom não ficar se martirizando por isso, senão adoece. Vida que segue.🌞♎
日本語でごめんなさい。世間的には、悪いことだったかもしれませんが、僕はハニーの事を、守ったと思ってます。とてもかっこよかったです。これからも、日本で応援してます♪
he's clearly a good guy. Forgive him
Gotta love irony. An apology for cold unpleasant behavior from a man who seems sensitive, creative and caring.    Lots of contrasts going on in this room.  A man sits in a stoney cold-looking walled room with metal furniture and a glass table.  Brrrr....    However, the room is decorated with art , bookshelves, a singing bowl, and plants, a turntable with no amp, comfortable seat cushions, pictures and books.  Trying to soften things up a bit and imply a character of  intelligence, culture, history, family and overall mental and emotional well-being.    Getting a closer look -   Artwork on the wall: "The world is sick.  Love is the cure.".  Hmmm...   If a person has love inside them and looks at the world with their eyes of love, they don't think the world is sick at all.  The thought that they need love to "cure" anything would never occur to them.   In Contrast -  Book on the coffee table:  El Anatsui, a man who finds  discarded items that other people think are ugly, useless, dirty or "sick" in his environment, yet he sees the beauty in them and pieces or positions them together in union to make larger beautiful art.  Some got it, some don't.  "You are what you eat." applies to one's digestive system, but also the eyes, ears, nervous system, mind and soul.
This is his best performance yet. 💀
Anyone else thing of Aaron Paul and the 'I APOLOGISE" clan 😂
so…anyways………reminds me of james charles, tana, tati, jeffree, shane, who else can yall name?
Bro is getting forced to say this
이걸 사과하네...답답하다~~~ 뭐 때린거 미안하다고 할 수 있다만 맞은애는 뭘 잘했다고 피코하고 다니는건지~
We (me, my family and friends) love you Will Smith! Thank you for the video and can’t wait to see more of you (videos, movies etc)
What’s wrong with you, people? Everyone makes mistakes. I sympathize with Will, and he has to forgive himself first.
“Keep tony’s name out of your fuckin mouth” - Chris
"travis scott apology video round 2 babyy"
Well, its all good in the hood.
There's nothing you can do my G to change what happened. Chris himself didn't play professionally that night by making such comments on your with publicly. At least you did the right thing in this video. Sometimes bad feelings can push to do wrong things, acknowledging that you were wrong that's a noble gest. We hope to see again more happy videos as you always do.
we all make mistakes baby let’s all love each other. Will you a great guy in my eyes still
Dude studied every YouTuber apology ever with that dramatic entrance 💀
Ya know, I hope it works out. We had our fun at his expense, but I'll feel better about myself and humanity in general if it works out.  I've done stupid, insane, and self-destructive things. If I see a huge example of redemption and change, there's hope for me. Will has to go deeper than he's ever had to go as an actor to make sure he's not fooling others or himself to make it real and lasting. Same for me. If I didn't think it was possible, I'm giving myself a death sentence or live w/o parole at the least.
why _now_ ?
Will why did it take so long for an apology?   Will: Shieiiiiiet you know a nigga gotta eat. Mansion wont pay for itself and movies wont get green lit until I do This.
Why did it take so long Will? You know you need a divorce but she'll take half at least. Just make more movies after you wipe your slate clean. You deserve a sound mental health.
Appreciate the video I do. However, would've been good to apologise to the community of comedians as well. You don't want to be the flash point for people storming the stage because they are triggered by comedy. It's already happened at a Chappelle event since your incident...
Is this guy Logan Paul?
I'm sorry but the only one you should be apologizing is Chris and to tell us the public that what you did is wrong. I maybe wrong but it seems like he is doing this more for the public and his fans than for Chris and his family.🤷
Чтож ты Вилли сдал назад…Позор
YOU ARE LOVED AND RESPECTED WILL.
俺からしたら自分の妻をバカにされたらああなってもしょうがないと思う…
i have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement
we all make mistakes.
Even the way he apologises to chris is through gritted teeth. Phoney as hell!
Apparently somebody struggling to get work.
very nice fake message written by your PR.
Mad respect. 😆 #TommyShelby #Peakyblindersigma
When talking about how he let people down, he honestly should have said you know "I'm sorry I let fans or whoever else down, but recognize that I and other celebs as well, are humans just like you. We make human mistakes, just like you do" or something like that.  A lot of this is pure spectacle because oh well, a celebrity did it. Celebrities are people. They're not floating above us or some higher being, they are people who's passion and job is to try and entertain, across different mediums. Appreciate their character, their skill, and what they do - but please don't worship them. A lot of this stuff wouldn't be as such a big deal if we just stopped worshipping celebs.   It's okay to admire, but worship is pushing it. These are two different things. Like personally I'm a fan of Christian Bale, I like his characters in multiple movies - but it goes no further than that. It shouldn't ever go further than that.
Will is a good man. We all make mistakes. Lets learn to forgive and forget.
The amount of judging little people on this comment section is huge. I suppose none of you know what means to mess things up and try to fix it. I hope that people around you (family, friends, work, school) would not be so hard on you when you inevitably will make a mistake.
Chris hasn't got back to you yet? Sounds like a lost friendship u ruined bud
Its rewind time
If only we could see the dislikes
Covering up... 🙂
He never says I’m sorry this hole video!his family is messed up. #Chrisrocklifesmatters
“It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, but you can lose it in a minute.”― Will Rogers
👎
Start a new life with someone that brings out the best in you not the worst in you Will. Stop clinging to a relationship that isn't working and the results are making you act negatively.
Ima be honest I just found the whole thing HILARIOUS 😂
it takes guts to apologize. what you did wasn’t right but your apology was
i don know what guys think , but Will doesn't deserve this, sure his action was't acceptable and he could have expressed himself in so many better ways but so was Chris's. u cant moke people with something hurtful that hasn't even passed yet, its not her choice, let me ask yall a question, what would have u felt if someone moke u for your sexuality (being a homosexual or...) or the color of your skin ?! wouldn't the world go mad? and why is that? cause its not your CHOICE , so what is the diffrence here ?!
I love you dude, but you really should make sure your info is correct. Right after he said why he didn’t apologize to Chris in his acceptance speech, he literally said “Chris, I apologize to you” and you said he apologized to other people but not Chris himself, that’s not true.

To forgive is divine but damn man...you should have your son who irresponsibly twitted praising your actions also apologise..clearly you haven't reflected enough. Seek and apologise to Chris and his family privately rather than in the limelight, this sh!t isn't Hollywood dawg.
Hope he and Chris can reconcile. Both of them are amazing men that we have all looked up to while growing up.
No
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
..I think a helpful remedy and kind of spiritual 'equation' or 'guidance' for peace is in our hearts especiallly if we can't' forgive is to ask for help from our higher power (aka God) but.. is to pray for peace in the world. x
I heard bout this video and didn’t look it up, just went straight to youtube trending page 🤣
That was really cool of you Will. Thank you brother.
He left the comments on like a real man of culture.
“You never know when a black person will suddenly snap and do you harm.”  This is the message constantly in my mind.  Sorry, just speaking my mind here.
This is Will Smith's 1st mistake in like 30 years and social media wants to eat him alive... Bunch of drama queens, he deserves a 2nd chance, what he did is far from unforgivable.  MOVE ON ALREADY.
If you were genuinely sorry you would not have turned this into content. You would have talked to him privately, or are Hollywood people so out of touch they think this is normal.
Sociopaths will be sociopaths.
There is a big difference between saying i apologize to you and i'm sorry. I dont think people understand the value of just saying i'm sorry and i think it's most important thing to say during an apology which he does say later on to other people but never to chris. But again you are a good actor which means i dont know are u really that sorry or its just act like a youtuber make a video apology.
Take 5873
If only he could rewind time
It was a cheap shot by CR and he knew it.This highly charged sort of reaction was inevitable if you ask me. Will just happened to be that guy! I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner at one of these award fiascos. These award shows have become more about roasting celebs lately than the real reason that they are there for in the first place. Showing them respect and recognition for their acting ability. But I suppose giving out boring awards these days don't get any ratings like roasting cornered celebs do. I like CR and Will, I feel that they're both a victim of this ridiculous format these shows are forcing on them.
I think everyone deserves a second chance. People have done far worst in Hollywood and haven’t faced half of the consequences Will has. It’s time to move on.
This the same guy that said, "If I could control rewind I would want Fortnite and Marques Brownlee" truly inspiring, Will. It's rewind time
KING CUCK has spoken.  Bow to King Cuck 🤴    🙇‍♂️
To fking late.
Love you, Will. Take your time, we’ll be here waiting.
Game over man, game over!
Its up to Chris at this point, he'll do the right thing
I see it I say it #CLM ✊ 🍋
Too little, too late.
We love you Will
Take an extended time away from stress and toxicity that surrounds you to rediscover yourself Will. In my opinion, at your age and all your accomplishments both in your personal life and in the career sphere is significant enough to be consequential to warrant your attention to allocate time and energy on to reassessment of your life journey in-terms of where you are headed and how you should track. I have confidence in you to come out of it with lessons learned (some with summaries & some with sound plans ahead). Good luck to you! And I pray for your success.   Chris, I pray for you that your road to forgiveness to be safe and full of blessings.  God bless!
We forgive you Will. Forgive yourself.
Obviously Chris is the victim here but as a long time Will Smith fan I wish both Chris and Will the best.
Everybody makes mistakes. One mistake won't change who you are (an extraordinary person), or anything you've done. The only people who criticize are those who never do anything in their lives. The main thing is to admit your mistake and move on with your life.
Hey, it was a mad moment. That was genuine though and it does rectify some of the shock for me.  Unfortunately and fairly, some people won’t be able to look at Will the same. I hope he drops down to earth a bit more now, that’s when I really rated him.
The apology is confusing. If truly there was remorse shame is part of it to have done that. How can one not be sorry but not ashamed of the act he did ? mmm true it’s is chris he needs to forgive but saying remorseful without shame of the act mmm confusing and some
Anyways when Chris gonna get it back in blood?
i dont think you should publicly apologize to chris...i think you should privately apologize to him first.. and separately apologize  to the public..... it kinda seems insincere.. we all make mistakes .. we are human... but the fact that you don't want to feel ashamed for what you did is kinda off putting..... you can admit to feeling bad for your actions without completely beating yourself up about it.. idk this video doesn't sit right with me... and i dont dislike you i just think you have some more work to do on this issue you've created for yourself..  ☮💟
Will grow some balls man!!!
A YouTube apology is always the last gasp of a YouTubers career. Will, you should leave the toxic queen and find yourself.
Ummmmmm ummmmmmm ummmmm ummmmm ummmm
To be honest. This doesn't sound or look sincere. It's sounds and looks like something a whole PR-team set up and you're practically the actor. This is 100% acting.
I think that you're genuinely remorseful, but it's up to Chris
mmmm
People need to get off their high horse. He’s human and we all make mistakes. If I make a mistake very few will notice if at all. Celebrities mistakes are seen, capitalized, exploited, and criticized by millions.
He really had "Thanx ya'll" in the description LMAO
Tus acciones como persona rebosan integridad por lo tanto no podemos juzgar a un sujeto porque se le cayó una semilla cuando ya ha plantado un bosque entero.
CLM we stand with you Will Smith, we all are proud cucks, proud and loud!
Break up with your wifi then we will forgive u
CLM HER PLEASURE IS MY PLEASURE
I'm glad i can see the number of dislikes
Love when he said that 5:45
This doesn't feel genuine.
Will Smith confirmed for the role of Mera in Aquaman 2
You’re lucky dislikes are hidden.
Everyone has their dark moments, its unfortunate that one of Smith lowest points was witnessed by the entire world. I hope Chris finds it in his heart to forgive Will and I hope Will finds peace. No one is perfect. Love you Will
Nothing is irreparable.
He didnt even think to use a neuralyzer? Like cmon, easy fix 😎
Oh and here I was imagining he will take responsibility.
Whether this apology is sincere or no is irrelevant. It was necessary. He could not do ANYTHING in the public eye without acknowledging what he did that March night. Now, he can move forward.
will it is what it bro. theres always gona be haters and ppl that respect what you have done. at the end of the day u be you and stand up for what u believe and stay true to yourself and family. beyond that its all noise! f#ck em is what i'd say!
I can't say anything now I feel bad for both Chris and will now 💀
🍋✊ CLM
This is just lot of swing but makes sense. Here too express understand much more
Thanks Will, I needed that... a good hearty laugh.
Too late. 4 months too late.
Everybody fake deep in the comments LMAO
Typical YouTube apology after messing something up. No one cares dude.
It alright to mess up every now and then.
I love you Will
I never lost love for you bro
Now he's a true youtuber, he can even make a fake apology video with fake tears and promote something at the same time.
I never thought that will smith was a robot but now I’m not so sure
Loved everything the man has done since the Bellair days, spread nothing but joy, love and happiness for decades. Seems insane to condemn him for one misguided action. Everyone makes mistakes, wonder how those who judge him so harshly would fair under the constant, unblinking eye of Hollywood's limelight.
Will is intentionally speaking slow. Can tell it's intended... Can also tell he was coached well prior to the final take..  Plus he be advertising he's kid's WATER product?? Nah.. this smells fake and rehearsed. He probably got a movie or some business coming up.. and this issue was in the way, had to clear the air and "apologise".. After 4 months? Nah.. don't buy it.
Fake
Would love to know the number of dislikes on this..
Ratio
For whatever it's worth Will, I know you are a guy who tries hard to be GOOD.   It happened, you did it but I still support you.  No one can know what you were going through.  Don't be ashamed.  Your remorse is enough for me.  You are still a BIG man in my eyes.  Still a fan.  Thank you for this.  I already knew you had this in you. Feel loved man.  Forgive yourself.  For what's it worth.  Ignore little minds who can't accept that you are human and made a mistake. All my best wishes.
LMAO THE “CRYING”😭
This is fucked up someone who is "Human" would have dealt with this sooner. They would not wait for a PR team to write a good script for them. They would not be using an apology video to also promote their own and families products. There is nothing "human" about this video. Even the robot "will" talking is just insulting.
This dude's insane!
Please don't apologize. There is nothing wrong with your actions. People who make fun of their loved ones in the spotlight of the world are wrong. That moderator is the worst.  I'll say it again. you are not wrong
idk man. Will just seems so mentally disconnected. Like something deeper is wrong with him that we cant see
He’s got a movie coming out I bet
L
Will, did you see 'Elvis?  Great movie. Keep swinging-for-the-fences.
I don't buy this the only reason your sorry is because he got caught and the heat is on you otherwise you won't be a sorry for a damn thing you know it and I know it
Damn, an actor this is a poor performance
According to the 'return dislikes' chrome extension, current likes at time of writing is: 78k likes 92k dislikes
But Will what you have done was extremely bad but in a mean time you were hurt as well by him
It’s just not good dude.
Apology not accepted..😂😁
This is a great relief. Everyone has moments of confusion and I am happy you managed to figure it through.
what ever i still love you what ever you are acceptable from me
Over it....
If they only knew the kinda fans they had now ... Every Hollywood celebrity would roll in the 500million dollar grave.
Wills answer @4:45 is something I’ve personally thought of when reflecting on past mistakes.  We are human, and we all make mistakes.  It doesn’t make it okay, but we pick ourselves up and keep going.
*I'm not buying it*
😂
nahhh
HELLO MASTER WILL AND WELCOME BACK TO DFNUNIVERSE 😅🤗🖤💪🏽😎✌️
At this point it should be "forgive me". "Im sorry" is a few days after what happened, its been months. And we should not be holding on, you should.   We will think about the apology, give the people 4 months.
An overproduced, long overdue, piece of rehearsed crap. This comes across as more of an apology to himself than anyone else. Typical Hollywood narcissist.
bruh
Dislike is currently at 160K
Yes Will, you did stupid thing and let be it. Just give it a time for Chris. He is your friend afterall.
I wish youtube still showed the dislikes
YOU RUINED YOUR CAREER
CLM!
too late
😂😂😂
bla bla bla
im sorry but i don't believe Will is sorry at all,,,cos his taking so long to say it
Hope chris actually reflects on his action. Chris should apologize and kowtow to you a thousand times at least for mocking your loved one in front of such a huge audience. Just imagine guys, if your parents or loved ones gets mocked at for their medical condition, how'd you feel? laugh along? It's not even funny at that point of time.
Thing is, there’s a lot of comments here saying “we forgive you will” but to be honest it isn’t for us to forgive him. It’s up to Chris. He can only make that call.
"The world is sick". no it's not, the world is healing.
It's Smithin Time baby!!! Loved the announcement of Wild Wild West 2 featuring Kevin Hart at the end of the video.
Nice job, Will. Don't let the negative comments distract or discourage you. Most ppl have no idea what it takes for deep self analysis. The sincerity was obvious from my pov. You'll find your way in time. You're definitely not a piece of sh*t. But someone worthy of self forgiveness. You have amazing manifesting powers. Remember a couple of years ago telling Dave Chappelle that you've earned the right to have a major public fail? Your spirit obviously needed this for a reason. You seem to be on your way to discovering it. Be thankful for this unique experience that's set to bring you massive spiritual growth and self awareness.
Chris said he's not ready to talk. And then you make this public video, in front of the world telling him whatever you wanna say? Until now,  I still can't see any respect from Will Smith.
Every human being is a human being who makes mistakes and a human being is not infallible in his footsteps, forgiving, generous, Chris
愛する人を侮辱されて、怒った貴方は間違ってません。クリスが100%悪い👎
(Homer Simpson voice)…BORING!
Still smug about it - I don’t buy it. A judge wouldn’t buy it either - be glad Chris didn’t have you arrested.
CLM KING WE STAND WITH YOU ✊🍋
Let's see how many brands you can spot in the video.
Still didn't hear you say the word sorry to Chris, overall i think you need to reevaluate if you happy in the relationship you in and how you being treated. To me it looked like you overcompensated for a woman who does not love you as much as you do her, the youtuber apology video was not a good idea Will.
whats up william, thanks for the apology, although I believe that it wasn't necessary, as christopher's comments were quite rude towards your betrothed.
If he really hated to let people down, he would never had agreed to Men In Black II.
“Breaking my silence” vibe.
Will: "how many people got hurt in that moment.." and the most painful things are your advertising and movie contracts.
LOL😆
bro its done

Uh oh, Richard!

Why does he talk like a kindergartener reading a book?  I, um.. a-apol..igise.........
You’re just lucky Chris Rocks brother didn’t get involved Will. His names The and he’s a big bloke.
after all he's a great actor 🤣
Gone from being in Rewind to posting an apology video. Will Smith is taking this YouTube career seriously.
This should've been handled offline. The whole video feels arrogant because the focus just shifts to yourself. You've got some stuff to work through, Will.
I put this apology video at a solid B+ tier. He addressed a lot of issues with himself and was openly honest about his mistake during the moment. However the intro was still a generic apology video. A blurred walk in scene with a side shot to make him look more remorseful of his actions which was kinda cringe. Thankfully he didn't bring a dog out or it would've tanked him to a C tier. I don't know guys if he had ended the video with an interpretive dance it would've bumped him up to an A+ tier maybe even an S.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Chris should shout to will down the phone "keep my family's name out ya f*ng mouth
Why does Will look like a truck driver
<33
To quote Judi Dench: "too late, too late" 🤣
An actor doing what he does best!
50 years old and can't control your impulses on a worldwide live telecasted event. Sort this privately instead of monetising on this 'apology video''
You should keep all of this private. I don’t understand if you’ve already reached out, and Chris said no… why would you make it public? This smells of PR drivel.
Some good old rewind time would be nice right about now
Well. This comment will probably go unnoticed among the bulk and myriad of comments in here, but I have to take this out of my chest. Will. Willard Carrol Smith. We all make mistakes. We all fall in our life. We all are guilty of something. And we all have the right and the responsibility to acknowledge and be sorry for those errors, and to learn and become better persons once we realize we f'd up. Many of us know you had a lot going on in your head and heart. You most likely were filled up to the brim in your head with crushing blinding enraging outofmyhand situations that on that moment made you take a bad choice. We all have done that. But just a few have done it so publicly. I feel your apologies to Chris and his family truly genuine and from your heart. I really do hope it is in their's to give you the place and the moment to do so in person and in private, because I feel that it is something you need as well as them. And if in any certain time they do give you the opportunity to do so, you do it without cameras filming, and allowing them to make it public so it is them who really forgive you. We as an audience are the very worse and most judgemental kind that there will ever be. We love to see the mote in one's brother's eye without noticing the beam in one's own. So we are not important in this step of your life. What matters is you, your family and Crhis' family. I really do hope that you both can get to a middle ground and fix the gap that the incident brought upon you all, because both of your families deserve it. On another note, I hope that you can obtain the clarity and sight to understand that the person that it is by your side right now it is a big player on what whent down that evening, even though you're not willing to accept it or recognize it. The pressure will find a way to come out. And on that evening it did. And that person is not willing to accept it nor take accountability on it. And that just speaks volumes on how entitled and narcissistic that person is. I don't have proof but also I have no doubt.  Peace man.
No one is perfect we have done something wrong in our lives as well it does not matter how long it took you to heal and apologize what matters is you did. The bible says "forgive us as we forgive others" love and light❤️❤️❤️
Love you man. ❤️🙏🏽
you're being controlled, break the genjutsu and fight back! remember who you are, you were right in your actions. don't let them control you, stop being a npc. you're already rich, expose them all and destroy the matrix!!!!
We all make mistakes The ultimate judge is The Most high He knows our hearts and those who are really sincere. I wish the best for Chris and Will.
*Let's all welcome Will Smith to the Youtuber Apology Video community* :D  slightly scripted, slightly improv. good serious ambient tone of talking.. i would give it a solid 8.5/10. Good job willy
Y'all forget the real culprit, the elephant in the room. "Lucusta"
Logan Paul did it better
Your big words and the way you are trying to make yourself believe in your apology and about the whole situation are so important to you. Man, this is not for Chris this is for you, you want to see how people feel about it stil.
No
Oooohhh I can’t wait for @the behavioural arts to analyze this…
that was awful
Will we all got ur back brotha... don't be so hard on urself.
Love you, Will!
It don’t matter what I think, but for what it’s worth I’m hoping this was a sincere apology.  I like the Will Smith persona, real or otherwise.
I really really really have no idea why this is important. There are many difficult things going on in the world that need attention. This is not one of them... Unbelievable.
Gaaaaaanndduuu
Bully Maguire: “You shoulda thought of that earlier!”
30+ years of perfect behaviour. People prolly should just forgive this man at this point. What happens between him n chris is up to them as men behind closed doors
This guy looks doped up.  Where is the Will Smith of old days???
The fact that didn't he just send this to him directly rather than posting it on his YouTube, is everything you need to know about celebrities and their detachment from the real world
Okay…I understand what Will is trying to do here. But, here’s the thing. I have always believed that anyone that says “I apologise” or “my apologies”, is somewhat insincere or disingenuous.  It’s one thing to say “I apologise”, but it’s a whole other thing to say “I’m sorry”. It’s harder to say “I’m sorry” and genuinely mean it. Will did not say “I’m sorry”, and I think this video would’ve been a lot more effective, and a lot more believable, if he had said that instead.
This is definitely one of the youtube apologies of all time
Hard R
yes we are all human and make mistakes. it took you a while to get your head around and make this statement. that shows you really thought about the repercussions of your actions and acknowledged your wrong doings sincerely.  GOD BLESS YOU GREATLY AND MAY YOU WALK IN THE PATH OF HIS LIGHT FROM NOW ON!
Ok
Cool, didnt need to make an apology,  but cool.
Lol Will , you should have kept it moving cause this video gave us nothing.  I really feel like you chose to act like a hooligan and humiliated Chris whereas you could have spoken about it after the show, there was too much anger in your soul that night and chose the smallest person to take it out on and that apology to the academy was the cherry on top showing how bad you wanted to humiliate another person. Lost all my respect for this guy
This apology is tarnissed.
Nobody cares anymore, it’s been four months. Get over yourself and move on.
Too bad he ruined it at the end with « a feeling of disrespect or insult ». Couldn’t help himself justifying himself and putting the blame back on Chris again. So disingenuous because it invalidates again every word that came before. There was no insult, Will. It was you who cussed out Chris.

this doesn't even look an apology lmfao
Will Smith was not wrong.  The end.
Everyone of us throwing stones at you have all done something we’re not proud  of. You CAN move forward from this.
Get out of our faces.
C'mon, Will!! If Chris clearly said he doesn't want to talk about what happened, you don't make a YT video about what happened, so he's put in another uncomfortable situation... That's called respect and taking responsibility. This video will inevitably create another media cycle and you know reporters will reach out to Chris for his comment (which he told Will he wasn't ready to discuss). This stunt screams "selfish" and "attention-seeking" over being truly apologetic.
As you know there is always a bigger picture and plan, you both took Ayahuasca... She is showing the world something, it could be the hearts of the people watching or a trauma you need to face. Whatever it is, it's much bigger than many realise. Stay Strong...
Disgusting how this apology is all about Will.
i wonder if his wife's boyfriend checked over the script before he posted this
Every celebrity - Let's make a scripted cinematic apology video. Meanwhile PewDiePie - 'oops my bad ✌️' in a pinned comment.
Really wish YouTube still showed the dislikes
We forgive you Will. More importantly God's forgiveness is open to you. Regret and remorse is the worst feeling on earth. Had a taste of regret recently and its not funny. God bless you
bro trauma dumped
Will smith is a true YouTuber now congrats
You have to think before. Not now. You are done
These comments show how cruel and hateful the world is. I want to be friends with the ppl who have empathy in this comment section.Praying for you Will.
Self serving vomit sesh 🤮
전혀 사과하는것 같지가 않네.
The way he's talking makes this really hard to follow.  All over the place.  I have to keep rewatching same parts over and over again.  It's so mechanical, although there is some inflection in tone it doesn't come across as natural dialogue.  Just one big mechanical run out sentence.  He could just as well be reading Macbeth the way he's talking
It's so obvious that this man is in an abusive relationship with a narcissist and its not being taken seriously cos he's male. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Look at that production value. Real legitimate and personal apology, ain't it? At least there's no dog lmao
Someone please explain to me why this scripted, PR-filtered apology is genuine.
FFS grow a backbone man and get rid of that woman of yours! It's only money! You can't buy self respect!
No nominations for this performance. 🙈
Maybe he needs to move back to west Philadelphia and remember where he came from. 🤔
1:44 Hol up a moment
Now I can read your book 👍🏻
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
L man
man not a single dislike, the people must love him. and the video looks very genuine. THANX Y'ALL
Dude sounds like a god damn robot reading words on a monitor, this apology came *TOO LATE.*
Fresh PR stinks.
For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Matthew 6:14-15 NIV  FOR ME, as a Christian, I forgive you Wil Smith. I know you're remorseful for what you did. You are forgiven. May God bless you.
Chris will accept Will's apology because he is a nice and humble guy.
I'm Japanese and I don't know much about America. I found out what you did on the news. I just want to say, "Good job!" To be honest, it's not a professional job to get hurt and make fun of your loved ones. I was surprised that you posted such a video this time, but I respect it as your choice. And I promise to continue to support you. Thank you, Will Smith.  私は日本人で、アメリカのことはあまり知りません。 私はあなたが何をしたかニュースで知りました。 私はただ「よくやった！」と言いたいだけです。" 正直に言って、人をからかい、冗談で済ませることはプロの仕事ではありません。 今回、あなたがそんな動画を投稿してくれたことに驚きましたが、あなたの選択として尊重します。 そしてこれからも応援することを約束します。 ありがとう、ウィル·スミス。
Jesus loves you. Turn to him
Good Apology Video 💀🔊🔥🔥🔥🌊
Will, you didn’t disrespect anyone but yourself. Chris stood his ground and acted like a true man and professional. You’re not a genuine person anymore. Time to go back to Philly.
Too bad the dislike button doesn't work anymore.
You lost me as soon as your ridiculous PR team convinced you _“it’s been a minute…”_ is a good way to start *any* conversation.
*Top 10 YouTube apology videos*
Thank God YouTube removed the dislike button by the time this video came out 😂
Wasn’t that 4 months ago? Didn’t know anyone still cared or remotely thought about it still.
Things you do for publicity. Rocks should have been the one to clear his name. Not him weeping on video on yt.
STOP FAKING THE APOLOGY VIDEO , JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR REPUTATION BACK.
🤡
Not that it’s up to me but if I were Chris I wouldn’t accept this. Boooo no more Will Smith.
4 months too late
For everyone wondering, the video is currently at 78k likes to 89k dislikes. 👍
89k dislikes and 78k likes.GOD damn
I’m kinda shocked at the cynicism of the fact it took him some time to come to the public with this. The man has probably spent the last 4 months in therapy. Jesus. People so quick to forget about the context of his pain.
this is good
Why does anyone look up to this dude
Do One Thing Divorce Evil Jeda !
Thank you for not doing this at the red table.
You made a mistake, we all do. You apologised, you are a good man for this. Free yourself, and continue living your best life, as we all should/are. Life is short!
Just like what my man rich homie quan said once “blah blah blah blah”
Hey Will. What you did here is not easy. Don't feel bad anymore, look forward and enjoy your life man <3 br Klaus
LOL who asked
How do you pronounce Irreparable?
I do think he genuinely apologetic but I'm not gonna lie, If he ever speak about being nice or whatever- I'll just roll my eyes.
I never not was your friend my nigga, you did what was in that moment, and you took full accountability forr it, no excuses, and we respect that, sh%t I do.
such a shame. i always liked will smith, but the woman he married is poison. i always knew that she will be the end of him.
I genuinely thought it was a pr stunt. I think it still is but ppl were mad so he had to apologize.
This is a youtube classic. The Apology.  Good job Will. You didnt bring anything new to this performance but that should be the job of your wife-I mean script writer. Not yours.  Youre just going through the motions like a good actor should.
O Chris errou feio em fazer um piadas daquela de péssimo gosto. E o Will errou por da um tapa na cara dele é agressão ainda.  E depois o filho vim falar que na casa deles se resolvia a assim. Foi um sucessão de derrocada. Espero que o Chris nunca mais apresente,uma premiação.
You know what maybe youtube rewind 2018 was right maybe will smith is a youtuber he's done a youtuber apology and he even started it with a sigh
After 4 months of training you got the youtube apology down to a science
It's to let!
I am not disappointed at all. You are a human being like us, We ALL make mistakes (only we don't have a camera filming us 24 hours), you already apologized, and you can't do anything else, life goes on. Learn from your experience and continue to grow as a human being, time heals wounds, even the deepest. Do not lose the joy that characterizes you and remember the best is yet to come. Blessings.
Will is a huge letdown as a man
As long as you tried and asked God for forgiveness, your fine… in my eyes and the Lord’s
❤
Oof.
W
You're my man. Thanks for the courage  We all do mistakes. Forget it!   keep moving
🙏🏾
Too late dude. You’re a meme now.
Im not religious but im here to point out that, specifically you folk that read the bible and pray to jesus/god, Doesn’t he say something about forgiveness?  Y’all don’t be hypocrites now. WS ain’t perfect….and neither are any of yall.

And yo girl still thinking bout a dead dude and still not you
Chris should've sued regardless.
It's Jada's fault
The tone of the apology isn’t sincere, I doubt there were any regrets. He sounded mad not apologetic.
I pity you. You need to get out of that toxic relationship man.
I used to be a fan.  Now I don’t watch any of his past movies or new ones.  I always thought he was the total opposite of the hot headed and entitled celebrity, but he proved me wrong.  I could never be a fan again.  He’s full of BS in my eyes.  I’ll never view him the same again.
Show this video to Sandeep Maheshwari how to realise your mistake in life bullying is not the key .
I see a person, who knows he made a mistake, apologizing for his mistake. We are all humans. We all make mistakes.  The problem is we live in a society filled with boredom and meaningless. It doesn’t matter what Will does, there will be people who hate him and people who love him.  I wish you luck Will. I’ll keep going to watch your movies and having a great time, and listening to your messages to cheer me up...as always ✌️
88K Dislikes
pov: you're the deep from the boys
lol
Imagine if you could see the dislikes
E
You're a human man and we all make mistakes, no one is there to judge you. If God can forgive you that's enough.
Wait a minute, this guy sounds exactly like the genie from Aladdin
if ur wondering this video has 261k dislikes
God danm the dislike to like ratio  Ngl thought he was going to come in  "Ahh its not so hot"
he says he was fogged out but after the speech he went to the after party and dance. 🤯🤯💀💀
Can’t wait to see next movie! Will.  It time to get over it and move on. More important thing then this. But happy Will say his sorry.
In a way I feel bad for Will, I mean things like this happen all the time. But he is a huge celebrity who was on a world stage. It was just crazy. No matter what his reputation is forever tarnished. It’s really too bad. He should have apologized immediately during his acceptance speech. He also let down the Williams family and what was a great movie about them and their dad
Reap what you sown.
A little tooo late I think ...
Why he looking like Waluigi tho?
Ahhh the classic, sigh and walk into the frame of the camera
I dont think it was time yet Will.
*Whoever read this comment may your parents live 100 years with full of happiness*❤️
Слюнтяй
The Boys changes my view on this apology
2:46 Yeah sure
Noooo. It's not rewind time :(
“…. It hurts me-to know I didn’t live up to peoples image and impression of me” oof, that’s hard.
Says "I apologize" to Chris, but says "I'm sorry"to his family and friends.  Interesting.
I still believe he did the right thing. Stood up to a guy who was being a bully and making fun of his wife’s illness. If I was in his place I’ll do the same thing.
A true youtuber, we all clownes youtube in 2018 for the 2018 rewind but clearly the people at youtube made the right choice, this is how a youtuber apologies.
Yo the like and dislike ratio is 77k likes, 88k dislikes.
"I apologize" but didnt say "I'm Sorry"
Very hard to get it all “right” in this. Bound for criticism. Could this have been done better? Is he telling the truth? I believe he is sorry. I believe the consequences are enough to make most people stop and reflect, to realize they did something wrong. How deep does his sincerity go? Will and God know. I do believe he’s sincere in his desire to lean into the light. I think he’s battling ego, which was at the core of what was done and his own demons. I think he’s damaged and human like so many others. This was an action of humility. I don’t know what he’s referring to about his history with Chris, but it kind of puts the blame onto Chris. A perfect apology? No. From the production to the outfit and to how much it comes off as acting, it feels weird. But do I appreciate and respect his approach? Yes. Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone. I wish more people would see the strength in being able to say you’re sorry when you’re wrong. My respect for Chris on that day replaced the respect I lost for Will. I encourage the spirit of forgiveness for the sake of healing and evolving at the level of humanity, whether someone stays in someone else’s life or not. I hope as much good as possible comes from a situation that was really wrong. I pray healing and miracles come from pain and mistakes.
This whole thing is just ridiculous Chris is not man enough to take it and they're trying to use that to ruin wills career which will never happen so stop apologizing we have more important things to think about right now around the world. give us a great movie or something anything with you in it 😁
Alot of y'all judging him bit atleast he owns his mistakes!  Which is alot more than Any celebrity does period
If this man wanted to apologize SINCERELY, he'd have done it that night. He went dancing his a*s off instead, award in hand like he'd done nothing.
Bro these moment are sometimes necessary to remind us what our purpose is and kinda put us to thinking about what we are doing where we are going  and finally who we are .with your future action prove that you have recovered and I promise if you do ,you are gonna be even better than  the past …
How tf did he make the perfect YouTube apology 🤣
You had a choice in the moment and took the worst path considering the whole situation. You can try to “fix this” but I’ll never look at you the same again Will
Add this to the YouTube apologies list.
I appreciate that this is plain and simple.  No flair.  It is what it is, Will Smith apologizing.
Say “I’m sorry” to Chris. Not “I apologize”
clown
I think they should have tried a different take. also, he's not being genuine here but you can't tell that his family life is genuinely sad.
*Bruh*
Damage Control 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nothing sells a sincere apology better than placing a box of your company's water in the frame to advertise.
Oh so he was practicing his YouTube apology for 4 months
Pretty good clip after a few months of training
"Didn't live up to peoples image & impression of me" "remorseful without being ashamed" Please! Nothing to do with peoples image & impression, you did the wrong the thing, you should feel ashamed! Normal people would NEVER have gotten away with what he did. Heavily produced damage control preformed by a very good actor.
He didn’t have to do this… but he did.
sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
✊🍋CLM I STAND WITH YOU KING #CUCKLIVESMATTERS
Miss you Will!! Everyone makes mistakes! A lot of men would’ve done the same thing but afraid to do so.
Four months and this is what you came up with, it’s not even believable
I cried so much 😭 because while watching this video My Dog Stepped On a Bee.
If you publicly strip a man of his dignity on a global stage, he is entitled for a life long grudge. Best to let it be and move on.
0:22 Forrest Gump?
To err is human...We all make mistake.
❤ love you Will
Only Chris can forgive him.
I hate you are taking all the heat!
I can't judge him it's not my place . God is the judge not me and he knows  the heart. I would say to Chris forgiveness is for you not for Will be free move forward . The world is full of this behavior  and it's a weight you can be free from do it for yourself.  "Sweep around your own front door before you sweep around someone elses" Blessings to you both
I actually  pray you make a comeback .. and hopefully we'll see a new you walking without a toxic sidekick...
Are psychedelics playing a role in this introspective process?
I feel like a lot of people won't accept this apology just because the internet is stubborn like that for no reason, yet it really doesn't matter until we wait for Chris' answer to Will as he said he's waiting himself. In this situation, I am not siding with Will but I'm glad to see him deeply reflecting and owning up to his mistake. You can tell he's being careful with each word that leaves his mouth and I hope he keeps this behavior to show his growth and his determination to change.
I never not liked u i love u i dont care what u did #TeamWillSmith
I will always love and respect Will. He made a mistake a huge one a bad one. But Chris's hands are not clean. Will was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I don't condone what he did, but understand what led him to do what he did. And because he's been apologizing his azz off I will forever love and respect him.
This is so dumb
Will Smith don't gotta cuss to sell records...                                                                            -Slim Shady
youre forgiven!
How can people defend this guy? Just smackin his colleagues away
yeah you were one of the last person to show this behavior 😑 and somehow human beings sabotage themselves when everthing is going great in their lives. 🙄
nobody gaf
I've been a fan of yours from day one and I still am. I appreciate you for manning up, accepting responsibility, and working on the path to make amends. I wish you the best brother. I still love you bro. 🖤🙏🏾
The word 'sorry' is said to express remorse or sympathy. The word 'sorry' has a personal essence in it. Whereas the word 'apology' is used in a formal tone and used when one has done something wrong. While being apologetic, one might or might not be sorry for what they did wrong.
This should be a private conversation with Chris and Will. The only reason to do this publicly is to really do some pr. that said I feel a bit sorry for Will for being manipulated so long by a woman. It’s happened to a lot of very talented men over the years. Best to you.
Man how are you pulling roles if this is your acting
e
Not interested
u forgot about amy schumer
Jesus will guide you
People make mistakes in life. Whilst Will Smith made an incredible foolish mistake I also believe in 2nd chances providing that one is genuine in his apology. I feel Will regrets his actions for many reasons and I believe he deserves a 2nd chance to return back to the industry.
We are defined not by our words, but by our actions. This video smacks of PR work and reputational salvage when the actions to support it are lacking
This is the best, most sincere public apology I have ever seen. Full vulnerability, no buts or howevers, truthful and heartfelt. 👏
Yea it was …. ❤️
Boo this man. Boo this man.
as a society we really gotta move on from this
I was about to say thank you to Will and his sincere apology....and then I saw that he is selling a book just below the video.....wow.  very tacky.
Now it’s good that will is apologizing for his mistake, but when he was talking it sounded like how Hancock would talk when he told the officers “good job”.  In the movie it just didn’t genuine, I’m not saying he’s not being completely honest, but that’s just the kinda vibe I got from how he would talk.
what you did was a disgrace to the people who looked up to you. i used to be that person.  i can never be that person again.
We miss you on YouTube welcome back not here to judge no one is perfect
What would do it for you people 100 lashes?  He is trying to apologize and if that means nothing to anyone why is there so much value placed on it.  He cannot apologize just like you would he has to do it like he would.  Why change if nobody gives you a chance to change.  And I am 50 and still make mistakes, I didnt realize the rest of you had acheived perfection already wow..good for you.
Idc what anyone thinks because this man doesn’t deserve this damn much hate just for one mistake no one is perfect like people don’t do mistakes , people do way worse things unimaginable horrible things and they don’t get hated like this so give this man a break
он прилюдно задел твою семью, а ты так же прилюдно отстоял честь своей семьи.
my favorite movie is bad boys, wbu guys?
Can't stay mad at will smith
the bravest of all of u is the one who apoligizes first
Could've done this without advertising Just Water!
This all an act. Even the dislike count proves it.
This is what exactly expected of the  Will smith we know.... Yes what he did was not graceful & justifiable but to take complete responsibility of your act is courageous and keeps the hope of humanity alive.... Because we all make mistakes (literally mistakes not crime) but how many of us are ready to take full responsibility for their act and keep working on ourselves??...... I so didn't like what happened but seeing that "Will" you are being conscious of your actions and hence being able to accept what you did was wrong and you apologize humanity will prevail.... Hope you and Chris get to talk and share your heart to each other soon, and are able to bury the hate for each
So when you knocking out next black comedian?
It's not a big a deal as the internet is making it out to be.
It's a shame there's no more Dislike count.
Fight back and stand up my brother she really is breaking you
Will should consider the fact he deserves a receipt. And I'm sure will understands that he deserves it back man to man... Will is still one of my favorite actors but there's a guy code when it comes to those situations
I doubt you are sorry. Real apologies don't need to be broadcasted to the nation. You could privately tell Chris your apology. By broadcasting it so publicly, it is clear it's a PR stunt to fix your public image.
Yep. Your best shape thing was inspirational. I don't know where u can go 'new wave hippie family guy' after a gangsta rap move like this. 🤔 I thought it was fake but sadly seems not. I totally forgive you anyway but it's not up to me though 😀
One thing I noticed.  Youtubers only make apologies videos so they can move on and start making n uploading content.  This is no different.
I don't know if he was just nervous, but he kept seeming like he was stifling a smile while he said serious things. Strange.
Accepting responsibility is a big step. That's awesome, but it shouldn't stop there. I hope we see some behavior modification as actions speak louder than words. Good luck.
SO OVERDUE
Still didn’t actually say “I’m sorry” to Chris. And he’s four months late.
We all make mistakes, only difference is you have to acknowledge them publicly when your famous which makes it that much more difficult for everyone involved. One of the 👑  of acting taking responsibility, I love to see it.
Good on you mate. Never stop trying to be better, even if they won't let you! <3 from Australia! Too damn hype!
Jesse this is not free robux 2022 (working) hack, JESSE? JESSE
Hey Will, I am in a situation simular to yours, but without the physical harm. The best thing I did was to accept the ones I love to leave me to myself and find help my own way, without force.  I am in therapy and slowly rebuilding myself first and foremost. You and I share a feeling of letting everyone down is the hardest to bare. But we did.   I would not use social media to fix anything. There is a better way to heal. Best you, put yourself aside and ensure that anger is the absolute end of any reality.   It will take time...you will find the start as I have. You haven't found the start yet?
Forgive yourself and make the changes that God shows you to make.  You are a person who failed like everyone does and will do.
Thank you Will, for being so HUMAN. Oh, how everyone else gets to make their mistakes quietly in the dark, with so few ever knowing and those few ever so gently throwing stones at molten sandy panes. Bless their hearts.
I think it’s a little bit late.But who am I to judge it’s Chris choice to forgive him or not.
Hey Vanced user here...total likes 77k and dislikes 87k
Least he had the balls to make a video regardless if people think he is sincere. Good for you in making a statement.
Honestly, people are human and allowed to make regrets... everything that happened was awful and Will was in the wrong but I do think this is getting fully dragged out now. Life is short. Mistakes happen so learn from them and move on
You should apologize to him directly. Not behind the screen - like a publicity stunt.
Can't wait for I Am Legend 2 🔥❤️
Will's iconic old man grunt every time he sits down almost makes me want to love him unconditionally  lmao
Oh dang, it’s the YouTube rewind guy!
You shouldn't put any pressure on Chris to talk with you or accept your apology. You were the one that made the mistake. Own it and move on. Leave Chris alone. If I were Chris I would personally never forgive you and I never want to talk to you again.
I want the same type of apology video from Sandeep Maheshwari for Prakhar.. Accepting mistakes and saying sorry don't make you a weak or small person.. 🤗💕🎉
People need to get over it. Everyone acts like this kind of stuff doesn’t happen in our own backyard all the time.
The guy holding your cue cards was flipping them a bit too slow
🤡
I think people would be happier if you left her brother she’s put you through a lot already as it is
😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡
NYENYENYENYENYENYENYENYENYE YADAYADAYADA BS
My math prof said it the best: everyone hates forgiveness until they need it themselves. Will definitely did something wrong but eventually he deserves forgiveness, it’s been enough time.
L
Would you talk to him? Would you accept his apology? I supose this is part of your self healing and part of the process. In fact because of your status that process will be longer and harder. Ultimately I wiuld like to see you and Chris link up but who gives AF what I want. This mans livelyhood was dimisnished in front of his peers and his peers began questioning their livelyhood as comedians. That will be just as hard to repair.
I guess Will Smith is a true YouTuber
Took you long enough
Lmao don’t care, movies suck. Always plays the same character. “ha ha haaaaa”-Will Smith
A moment doesn’t define your life. You made a mistake, but you are a good person. Peace and love ❤️
Brother will needs healing from something deep down   I personally don't accept this apology but  I'm rooting for him to become a better man and human being and resolve his demons he's fighting inside because they are def eating him up but aye baby steps none of us are perfect so will smith just take it a day at time.we are all watching for your progress brother #Love conquers hate
It's crazy how penguin0's video on this video has the same amount of views as this one in only 6 hours lol
What's he talking about?
Почему он сделал видео тëмным?
You're married to a Narcissist, move on from her and continue the self improvement.
For those of you wondering this video got *85k dislikes*
Good will  let's move on your said it nice 👍🏿👍🏿✊🏿✊🏿
L william
"I apologize." Not I'm sorry. 😐
#BoycottWillSmith
Why is he talking. Bro we over it.
Its not the worst acting hes ever done,yall see ali?
“I apologize, I did a mistake!” Made me think that Chris was lucky enough that Will had no gun in his pocket; apologizing would not probably have been enough then.
♥️♥️
lmfao makes it now....
Ты должен был быть джанго
"I apologize to you" sounds like the most forced and ingenuine apology ever.  It's like that time A-Train apologized to Hughie in the first season of The Boys.
I believe Will really misses his friendships he had with Chris and his family. I think he made a mistake and I truly believe he wants to make amends and is upset by what he did. That doesn't mean Chris has to forgive him and if he doesn't that's okay. I think both men can move on from this and Will can do better next time.
WE LOVE YOU WILL  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yall in the comments lack forgiveness..my word.  He made a mistake like every human has did, instead his was public. He is sorry let's move it along
goddamn this is late
i watched fresh prince as when i was 8 years old or something (probably a bit too young) i grew up watching will smiths stuff. I  think we should forgive him.
I’m here
Oi Will! Tudo bem? Sou sua fã, desde 'Um maluco no pedaço'. De fato fiquei chocada com a cena e tive que ver para acreditar, pois não achei que fosse  errado quando me contaram. Sinto muito que as coisas chegaram nesse ponto, mas fiquei muito feliz de ver que você esteve e está refletindo sobre a sua atitude. Muito honrado da sua parte assumir o erro e tentar reparar. Espero que esse pequeno trecho da sua vida, não tire o seu brilho. Continue espalhando amor! Adoro ver o ator que você se tornou e espero ver muitos filmes seus ainda. Um beijo grande de uma grande fã brasileira. 😘
Stay strong man .. this shall pass too 🙏
People don't think you're a nice guy anymore dude. There's no fixing that.
Good thing uncle Phil isn't around to see this bs!!
This could’ve been a 15 second video. “Hey Chris I’m sorry for being a cuck. THE END.”
I believe this to be the word of the LORD for you: This experience will bring you into the man you are destined to be. You will be a bridge to the races. You will be an instrument of peace. The former days will be no longer. You will go forward being recognized by the new you.  May God bless you and your family
You should be ashamed of your behavior, that being said God willing you will learn from your mistakes
I can’t help but think if they did put that light directly behind him for a so called halo effect that would be hilarious. I can’t say it worked on me but I’m just upset because all his apologies seem to skim past who he should be apologetic towards. Maybe it’ll work on someone else 😇😇😇😂😂😂
Place your bets folks!  Was it a 'berg or 'stein that made him make this video! Answers will be noted down in my next YOUTUBE SPECIAL, BE PREPARED IT WILL SHOCK YOU!!!!!!
This video is a public apology to everybody. His real apology will be private and direct to Chris. That's none of our business so stop whining about him not taking about Chris
I love will smith but this was some sienna Mae level apology
Once a reputation's broken, especially when you're a celebrity, it's almost impossible to fix it. Sorry, Will, but sorry's not gonna cut it. People have moved on from you. You just have to find a different line of career. I heard they're hiring at Walmart.
"I'm human". Yes, we all are. We make mistakes despite of our personal status. No one should judge this man, his conscience already did that to him, he's remorseful, he's sorry!!
Ya. I just hope hom and Chris can work this out. Damn what we think.
Will smith apologizing to Chris: 😐  Will apologizing to Chris’s Mother: 😭😖
We love you Will, be strong... he was disrespectfull...
The only reason he posted this is so he can make more YouTube videos and continue his career.
Accept the apology and move on. Holding a grudge isn't a very wise idea.
even tho dislike is not on youtube, as a premium member i would gladly give ypu the like dislike ratio and it's like 70k dislike 83k as you cant see dislikes i guess
Obviously, it's' a PR strategy. The color of the shirt (Grey), the cap, and the unkempt beard are all strategically chosen to maximize the impact of apology.
Is their apology sincere enough is the lowest form of conversation. Let’s move on. More important things to focus on in this world 🤍
Why apologize on video then upload it to social media? Don’t apologize to us. Apologize to Chris. Do it sincerely, since you know you fucked up.
Can't wait to see someone do a cosplay on this lol
To heal, I’d say, let go of the need to put light into the world.  If it’s a beed you have, it’s unhealthy.  Focus instead on following the Light. He will show you what to do and when to do. Love is a Person.  Run to Him. Matthew 11:28-30
It's alright will we aren't mad at you what u did was morally wrong but u did it cause u thought it was wrong so it's alright.
I mean Will Smith did what he thought was right at the time and he fucked up he knows this but you can make it a drinking game of how many times he says um in this video
Does one apology and everyone back on the will smith train 😂
This might be the most unnecessary apology video ever
Nothing gonna work after what you did .
The tone of voice doesn't sound sincere to me, but its up chris to forgive & never forget and moves on without acknowledge this man.  This was to be an apology to chris and i just heard sorry babe and kids blah blah blah. That was more sincere.
This feels more like a desperate attempt to repair your reputation. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and go knock on Chris' door and apologise to him in person instead. Be humble, and maybe you'll earn some respect back again eventually. And no, a video of you sobbing and doing a few charities won't cut it.
like/dislike ratio is about 50/50 leaning dislikes. This is probably the only thing he can do to be on track for things repairing. I'm not mad at it, but it's basically just accepting he fucked up, and being ready to make things right if/when Chris is ready to show how that can be done. It's an acknowledgement, it's the beginning of an apology, and it's clear he's willing to own up to it, so we'll just have to see what happens.
84k dislikes You're welcome.
This cannot be fixed.
Let Chris decide,
Robo smith
This is giving me Kevin Spacey Christmas video vibes
damn aint no way he did it
male version of amber heard
I really love how so many of us gravitate towards other people’s issues that aren’t even our own problem, rly makes my day 😂
Sometimes you just need to get away
It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks! Will made a mistake and owned up to it. There’s nothing left for him to do. I respect you for coming out and apologizing.. that’s a MAN! Still love you dog ❤️
On The same day Beyoncé album dropped. Coincidence?! I think not. Oh Will! I see being good friends w Oprah got u wanting to top everybody like she always did.
Glad you have come back to accept that it was your fault. I hope to see both chris and you soon..
“That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
WHATEVER GOES DOWN BETWEEN THESE TWO IS THEIR OWN BUSINESSES, AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE DONE WITH AND EACH ONE MOVE FORWARD FROM IT, WILL DON'T ALLOW FOR WHATEVER TOOK OVER TAKE OVER EVER AGAIN, AND CHRIS DONT LET IT BE DONE TO YOU AGAING, WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES, JUST DON'T REPEAT THEM AND DON'T ALLOW IT TO EVEN HAPPEN. GOOD LUCK TO THE BOTH OF THEM.
stay cool prince, we love you buddy! ❤️
wtf is this💀
We all make mistakes. An he is paying dearly for it. He knows what he did was wrong and hes trying to work it out. Of course, it looks odd because we are all watching and waiting holding our breathe.
The sigh of a Youtuber preparing to apologize lol. Say IM SORRY CHRIS. Not I apologize. You gotta want to feel some remorse or just dont say anything at all
It takes a man to truly admit his mistakes and apologize for them. Kudos to Will.
Classic YouTube apology video, all it needed was him crying and it would have been perfect.
I have always loved your work, and God knows I could not cast any stones. God bless you and Chris and to all who were hurt. I would love to take back a few things I have done personally.  I will pray for you all. BTW still a fan Will ❤️
Honestly, your apology is as sincere as it gets on YouTube. I forgive you, Will. I really do. Hope to see you on movies soon enough.
Progress never ends. Learning and growing from life experience that's the goal.
She did roll her eyes, which is a way of communicating, such a bad moment but we learn and we do better.
This is not even nearly good enough; and borderline offensive.
L human
Much respect to you Will for this ! Shows a lot we all need grace in life you deserve it as well as anybody
Who..........................asked
🤡🤡🤡
Should I make a history(funny)or geography channel?
What in the cringe ??? 💀💀💀
You should be a lil bit ashamed of yourself though… or at the very least ashamed of your actions. You can be ashamed of yourself in the particular moment of time and maybe briefly for the time following but it doesn’t mean you have to hold onto it and continue being ashamed of yourself. But overall yes, I do feel like whenever you look back at yourself and your actions during that night, you should 100% be ashamed of yourself during that night.
Becouse is affecting to your budget... now you feel sorry and have to make a video... where is the woman protector now? What a shame guy...
Now i can finally say :         Siuuuuuuuuuuu
He should apologize to Chris' kids as well. How terrible for them to have seen his father humiliated and disrespected on the biggest stage.  It would have been more genuine if he'd said he was trying to figure out why he reacted that way and that Chris did not deserve that at all.
I genuinely can’t look at him the same way again
Will Smith???!!??
Dang the dislike to like ratio is crazy
Looks like he's reading a script, doesn't feel genuine
😂☝️☝️ broke asf mane
He's kinda apologizing. Kinda owning it. I dunno. Toigh deal here. I dug this guy. I know he's not a douche, and he's done good work, but that moment just can't be undone.  Its sad. Can't watch Independence Day or MIB anymore. That pisses me off too.  Liked those films. The whole situation just sucks 100% for everyone. Gonna take 5 yrs min.
I grew up listening to your rap and watching fresh prince.  You were a role model of positivity.  Only to become what seems to be just another rich hollywood out of touch infection.   When you felt the anger rise up in you, instead of walking up on stage, you should have walked out - regardless of the pressures of an award coming up.  You need to find yourself again sir, regain control, and also regain the love and humor you used to have.  IMHO the #1 thing wrong with American society these days is the complete downfall of humor and comedy, for without those, we cannot be humble, have fun, and release tension, and also see the silliness of our ways.  Once a society stops being able to laugh, it's O V E R.  I hope you find your way back, and in time help others as well, and if you can't, separate yourself from those that suck you down into their pits of ignorance, hate, and despair.
Could this be another attempt to get attention or try to get back some lost movie contracts?
Wills reputation and respect gone down alot, and its not comes back ease,  atleast he apologised atlast, its something. But i cant see his films same way, like i was watching before. Now beter not watch at all.
I guess since bad boys is in the making he had too
This was a boondocks certified nigga moment
I forgive you, u made a mistake, ur human emotion took over and reacted like that and it’s normal, some people will never see u the sand again and some will forgive u and move on. In the end of the day, Chris will have the final vote. Take care will.
Classic apology video, Will Smith is my favourite youtuber
It's a shame he can't attend next year's ceremony to accept his award for this performance, bravo
Its gonna be ok we love u will 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
He is a really good actor.
It would be better if Will Smith apology to Sidney Poitier!
Will it takes a lot for anyone to admit when they are wrong.  Your apology looks and sounds sincere.  Two versus from the bible come to mind and I hope everyone can give these verses more thought in a time where we are so quick to rid people from our lives for anything we deem wrong.  The first verse is Ephesians 4:32 "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."  and the other verse is Matthew 6:14-15 "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."  Don't forget to place your trust in your Father in heaven and let him show you the path he has laid before you.
Why was this the first video when I searched “YouTube”
Will, you’re human. We all make mistakes.
This video has 72k likes and 82k dislikes
Average YouTube apology
82,903 dislikes and counting btw
Didn’t even say sorry just I apologize
I’m sure this has more dislikes than likes
We forgave you long time uncle Will
Once the money and fame is gone cue ball will finally let him off his leash and let him run free
All I see in Will Smith's eyes, are the eyes of a BROKEN man due to his whole fiasco that's been happening in his life, you can see the genuine sparkle in his eyes when he was young compared to now, all this craziness has been wearing on him and it Shows in his body language and just by looking at his eyes
We respect you will
Waiting for Andrew Tate review 🤝🏾
#bringaugustback
youre good bro
I've always been inspired by Will. It was a big let down to see what happened. That being said, he has always be clowned and scrutinized harshly for trying to be a figure of morality for the black community and I think he just had a breaking moment. He is human. We all have to fight an ego. Most of us snap everyday under far less pressure.
I still love big willy style. We all make mistakes.
When the lawyer advises you on how to apologize.
Ironic how the poster says "the word is sick, love is the cure." BS Smith BS. You couldn't even spell out "thank y'all" in the description or have any other remorse there.
It’s been awhile since this has happened. And the fact that this man has to get up here and discuss it is somewhat disturbing to me. He’s HUMAN. The problem is, people tend to forget that part, they look at celebrities as if they are super human and don’t make human mistakes… and when they do.. it’s magnified. I’ve ALWAYS felt sorry for them, not envious just sad for them, all the money and fame, will never take away the fact that in the end they are just like us (just richer) their mistakes, problems, personal lives, are published and judged by people daily. I hate that he did it, but I understand it. Having to try and keep that “flag” in the middle while playing tug-a-war, is tiresome. And trying to be a parent , spouse , protector, provider, and maintain your senses  and decency as a human being… it’s hard, even when you aren’t rich. Having to be “just like us” and balance fame… I couldn’t do it. I would be miserable daily.
Now apologize for Wild Wild West.
Took you this long to apologize???
I despise Will Smiths' actions but not his acting!
Scripted
Nice try Willy 👏🏿
Chris probably walked out as the winner.
Apology video speed run challenge lmao.
Why did it take 4 months
If this guy was white he would have been in cuffs
I'm happy to see you, Will Smith.
4 months took Will to do this?
Use me as a dislike button.
You need to apologize to every person that dreamed of having even the slightest chance of being there that night in their childhood. That worked so hard at being there and feeling trapped not knowing what to do and feeling pressured to clap as you accepted that same award they dream of accepting. Chris deserves an apology. But those actors, directors, screen writers, costume designers, set designers, etc.. You robbed them of their moments. You’re a great actor and probably a great person. But your apology falls empty without including them, dude. I’m a fan and sincerely wish you an illustrious career moving forward.
Sorry is invented so people can do the same thing all over again and say sorry. The pain this guy lives with is more than any apology he can make. As wrong as he was everyone deserves a chance. Also it's a huge lesson for humanity, we all kinda lived through this turbulence and it did remind some of us how not to act. I chose to see it this way
4:15 this is his reason for being with a toxic person
SMOKING ON THAT WILL PACK
So nice of Will to promote his book and his "Will Smith store" on an apology video.
"It's been a minute. ...part 2  Can't wait to see aaaaaa"
He's apologizing for his own gain...piece of chit
I don’t have any ill will against you for what you did,  it’s between you and Chris, because I done my stuff in my life that I had to apologize for!!
One moment in time doesn't define who you are as a person or a man... It was a mistake. You have owned it and that is all that can be asked of you. As a black man, I forgive you. You have been a gift to the world (no pressure, right?) Keep smiling! Keep being a blessing!
Lol
I don't hate Will, but if he was the lead in a movie I would be discouraged to watch it
Only human, still LOVE yah .... 💕
I’m just impressed the comments aren’t turned off. That adds a bit of respect back into wills name for me. Unfortunately there’d have to be a whole lot more additions where that came from😝. For example…..it’s honestly impossible to even tell if will is for real about this or it’s just PR. He’s just become so fake and entitled and his families a mess. If he wants ppl to remember him as the fresh prince he could start with those issues lol
What are we, some kinda I apologize squad?
Give me a break. You're only doing this to try to make yourself look better. Didn't work.
I liked what you had to say. I wish none of it took place but at this point we can only move forward with things like these. Understanding and humility. Good job Will.
CLM
Lots of Hot Takes here, but his apology isn't for anyone here to accept or reject on Chris Rock's behalf.
I think this took a long time...and I feel like its self preservation.  I dont see truth here...what truly compelled you to act; the pressure of her eyes did.  The real problem isnt addressed and its not gone.  This is stiff and prepared...lets hear the truth....the real deep truth.  Not bein real...thats what I see.  I believe he is sorry for sure...but sorry for what exactly...for being held accountable?
At the end of the day, Will is human. He made a human error, acting on emotion  rather than logic. We expect better of him because he’s a celebrity and a role model, but expecting perfection simply because one is in the public eye is ludicrous. People who really view this man as a role model should understand. He is not a God. He is not infallible. He is human, above all else.   Respect, Will, for taking the time to reflect rather than spewing a meaningless apology the very next day. It’s clear that you understand the impact this moment had on not only your life, but the lives of Chris’s family and your fans.
Sir I think you should deflate your ego before you start trying to apologize
cool story bro.
All late😂😂
Will this is between you and Chris you don't need to apologize to nobody else 99.9% of all this so called "outrage" is cap. I'm not perfect and neither are you  don't beat yourself up too much because of a momentary slip in judgement we have all been there at some point. Take full responsibility and accept what you did put it behind you and move on with your life you got so many bigger things to accomplish. I know you don't feel or see it now but one day you and Chris will laugh about this, peace and blessings brother Will.
Love to see doing the work! 😻
I'm sure I'm not the only one to point this out, but I went down here to make a comment on how "we're all human" and "healing takes time" yada yada yada.... and there's a link to buy a Will Smith book. Not saying I'm not willing to forgive, it's just a bit weird but typical Hollywood b**lsh*t to be selling stuff on your massive f-up apology video! I'd rather see a raw, not money-grabbing apology or explanation video. #dobetter #benicer
Too late.....
Bro has been silent for 4 months
People online forgive who they want to forgive. It's super weird, it's usually them just copying everyone else.  Why didn't people accepted Logan Paul's apology 2 years ago? Because "it wasn't cool" and he "wasn't sincere" because YouTube/Twitter comments control the narrative.   With this apology, if people just blindly accept it, that's probably reasonable but very inconsistent.  Please don't give me any dead excuses about how Will is any different to any other random YouTuber
Too late.
I was here when the video had like 15k views lmao
Let’s be real: we’re on the outside looking in. There’s not much we can say or assume.  Yes, Will Smith is an actor. But, at least give credit where credit is due.   This man literally took the time out of his day to make this video, reflecting on his naive and rather immature decision making. Not a lot of people do that, especially people in his field of work.   We’ve all been through this phase. At least once in our lives, we all wanted to better ourselves in any way after a mistake has been made.  People need to learn this.
Acting lol
Does anybody actually believe this?
Maybe for the next apology you can tie your shoes.
STILL YUCK
GIRLS WITH A TINE MACHINE: I am your granddaughter.  BOYS WITH A TIME MACHINE: “It’s rewind time”
not pushing p bro
Sincere apology Will.   You are real one, and we look forward to more Awesome movies from you.
If no part of you thought that was the right way to act who was operating your legs for the trip upstage and then swing your arm to attack a much smaller individual?
You are loved and you are human. The optimal response? No, but understandable from a human standpoint. Mistakes are apart of life. I loved “remorse but not ashamed”. Keep your head up, and continue to grow from your own experience
Rochelle's husband works two jobs, she didnt need that! Even in your dreams, Julius gon be there..
Half a year later he say sorry, we don't care
Sometimes i miss the dislike count on youtube
When you, Big Will, can sit on camera and repeat this entire speech without using the words "I" and "me" in your responses, you will have grown exponentially as a human being.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Mans studied those YouTube apology videos and made this. I applaud you for only taking 4 months to do that 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Who cares?
thanks to you and depp for being shining examples of what not to be
Is anyone gonna mention the bullshit written on the board and the carefully constructed placement of those bullshit books? lol.   All these mofos gotta do is apologize from the heart but he hired a whole PR marketing crew for this
Get the divorce bro you been slipping ever since she stepped out on you.
So sneakers at the swami because your career is done!!!
this is hilarious
He is literally only saying sorry now cause he's had all his projects canceled and no one wants to do anything with him now, he's just trying to save face now that his career is in the shitter... if he was actually sorry he would of said sorry that night or the day after and he would of rejected his award... all respect went out the window after that night for him go cry to someone else.
I’m not sure if you’ll see this Will, but I hope you do. I’m glad you are taking accountability, and recognize that it was a very human moment. Disappointing people is just a part of life. Wishing you the best. P.s. don’t be so hard on yourself.. this too shall pass. ✌🏾
One quick bad moment should not ruin an incredible career and an amazing person. All of us have done stupid s*it - just not this publicly.
The true issue at hand is the Epstein torture island flightlogs. 'Splain 'dat.
Awesome
dont care, where is shark tale 2?
Still in Lala land with this shitty "apology". So dramatic.
Everyone makes mistakes but it takes a level of maturity to be able to own up to it, apologize, and be ready for the aftermath. For that the respect I have for you has grown and no matter what happens next I'll still be your fan.
Thanks for coming out with a public apology. As a fan i still support you
This is what happens when your not grounded
a literal simple apology video and these blood-sucking weirdos are wondering he is acting or not just spreading hate everywhere
Lost all respect for Will.
Who wrote this nonsense? Jaden?
You know, Will...it's fine that you're apologizing and trying to make amends. But an apology is empty unless YOU know what you need to do to fix it, and let the other person know that you know. I did lose respect for you, but I didn't lose all of it.   Now, whether this video is fake or not, is irrelevant. I'll take it at face value and accept that you have apologized, and move on with my life. If this was fake, well, then that's on your conscious, not mine.
Don't give up!
What matters is does Chris and the people closest to them forgive him. We love them, we love their works, but we don’t know them.
The thing about narcissists is that they get sucked into believing their own performances. This man needs help
He should have done this like a week after the accident happened, why would you wait so long to apologize?
Dude really love his son, put Jaden Smith drinking water bottle right next to lol
Society will keep making a big fuss about things even after they had been talked about… i dont really understand what do yall want him to do at this point give the man a kiss?  i dont even watch will much but yall really doing too much on this one
No
I believe you're sincere. And I also believe that's there is one word that you did not say in whole speech....God. If you have faith, I strongly suggest that you lean on it because that will see you through this entire thing...more than any of these comments or Chris accepting your apology.  Trust me, I am no self righteous Bible thumper.  But when you seek God's grace, I promise, everything will begin to feel lighter and better. God bless!
Such an insincere apology. The guy screwed up; own it. Learn from it. Humble yourself. It's time to grow up kid.
Bruh why
With your net worth of 350 million dollars, I say, give a big fat 200 millions dollars check to Chris to apologize and I'll buy your remorse. I don't think you're that sorry Will.
O.o
Meh…
I know you can speak a little bit of Spanish Mr. Smith and it would be great you can post a video in Spanish for your Latin American fans
This was so traumatic for all of us.
This is why I miss the dislike button. I suspect it’s 3 to 4 times higher than the like button.
You done messed up for real this time Willy
If you expect truth and empathy, don't look for it here.
I will accept this apology if this gets rereleased with Nintendo selects
Just take the L, dude.
So why he didn’t apologize in his acceptance speech...  cuz it’s all fuzzy 🙄
#1 on trending
Why don’t you admit that the whole thing was staged and stop it please set another ridiculous ploy so actors don’t get humiliated in front of audiences
nice try..see you in 10 years will... ✌
What an over rehearsed and self centred apology.
Yk this rlly don't sound that sincere to me that but that's my opinion !!
It's Rewind Time!
Is he announcing his pro golf career?
This is the worst acting I’ve ever seen
Everyone in the comments needs to shut up like honestly. We all are HUMAN and all make MISTAKES some way more worse he did.
Will was always my number 1 actor was I disappointed in him? Yes! But reading his book before this had happen it made sense he talks about his insecurities. At the end of the day he is human and humans slipped up hard to judge him without looking at ourselves in the mirror.
All this fuzz doesn't matter
apology not accepted young man
If will didn’t know that so many people hold him in such a high regard, he does now.
ok narcissist... staged word salad 👏- not buying it- your words, behavior, and body language betray you
I wouldn’t ever talk to Will again in life if I where Chris or anybody in his family.  The “nuances and complexities” was because you and that chic are just weak and weird. Ain’t nobody got time for that. Just go ahead and be ashamed..
Time to move on.  God loves you, Will.  We have all done stupid things that we regret.  May God bless you in His love, forgiveness and righteousness.  Jesus saves and stands as that perfect example for all of us.  May we all bow in reverence to the perfect, holy Son of God.  Love in Christ -  Your Friend,  Alex
I feel like hes not actually sorry hes just trying to get his fans back. Like he said his trauma is dissapointing people.🤔
We forgive but its all up to Chris.
big L right here fr
😐😑😐
Will when you “ laugh “ why do you always fake laugh ? It’s so obvious and literally you fake laugh for everything 🤣
dont care
NOT ok, you can't do something bad and some out say sorry few months later just hope it's forgotten.
You truly are a YouTuber now. Like the paul brothers and the ricegums before you, you’ve proven yourself worthy by making a dishonest YouTuber apology video. Welcome to the ranks brother
Why are you apologetic, we wanna see it again
Dudes hurting himself staying in this relationship
Adelante pero estarías mejor sólo sin tú esposa.
Wack publicity stunt
Your a good actor will but your not that good.
this is a deep fake his face isn't moving. Emotion less.
I forgive you but we can’t do anything to stop you from doing anything it’s your decision will
❤❤❤
No one cares. Nice hat though. Kinda fogged out.
And there is an add for buying will smith merch below the video… comon 😂 👎
You honestly ruined your image forever, forever going to be part of the will Smith name. Feels like PR slime because this situation didn’t get forgotten like you hoped
i think he's being genuine because he really is sorry
Why did he make a video about this lmfao? Didn't he already apologize and Chris's family declined?  This should've stayed personal. Y'all really tryna drag this out for views💀
奥さんを護ったスミスさんは素晴らしい。 その後のことを含めて奥さんへの愛情でしょう。世間の反応はどうあれ、気持ちもわかるしスミスさんに味方しますよ😆
Take it easy Will and people, life is short, befriend him again and start over again👏🏻
What is he apologizing about
GG gamer
Unfortunately you’re still with the problem.
Will Smith is a walking L
Um oh and and ahhhs aren’t acting points that’s mass communication 101 of thing you can’t say during a speech it shows nervousness
You trying to reach out to Chris to apologize in person, says a lot about who you are. You know what you did was wrong and you are facing your mistake and trying to apologize to Chris directly.  I sincerely respect that.  I hope you get the chance, for both of you.
You made a mistake, we’re all human. I’ve made them, I’m sure every single person in this comment section has as well. So absolutely No one should be up in here with this “Holier than Thou” posture, that’s inhumane, everyone deserves a second chance.
no Thanks
Will I hear ya, I really do, and if it was up to me then, yea maybe. But I'm sorry to tell ya son, this the real world. Seven billion different personalities and opinions some just looking for something to hate, just cause. This world isn't nice, and it doesn't forget.
this man is so dramatic
He had the juice but lost the goose
¿¿¿¿Is it just me or he sounded like you wanna laugh????
Honestly, this was an ok apology, I know others say that this is a text book YouTube apology but now all we need is for Chris to say anything on the matter
This should have been a private apology to Chris, nothing more than a PR stunt. Yuck
Big difference between "I apologize" and "I'm sorry"
We sure have a whole lot of Mr. and Mrs. Perfects in the comments section trying to judge others. 😂 Smh. At the end of the day, we ALL have our moments.
Can’t help but think this was really for us and not Chris. I mean this will probably get to Chris and facilitate a quicker resolution instead of actually waiting for Chris to decide he’s ready. All sorts of weird knowing this apology is going to reach millions of people and basically decide his fate for the foreseeable future in terms of being accepted back into the public spotlight.
So inspiring to see what alumni of the James Charles school of apologies are accomplishing!!
When this first happened, I thought it was a “work.” 🤷‍♂️
my favourite part was when he said "it's smithin time" and smithed everyone
Will, you are a human be, we love you for ever ❤️
HE DID THE BIG SIGH BEFORE TALKING OH MY GOD
aw hell nawww dawg wyd theres multiple reasons why this move is wrong bruhhhh 💀💀💀
E
Honestly, Chris doesn’t have to accept Wills apology but if he chooses to accept it, he can choose not to reconnect. Forgiveness does not require reconnection.
He's probably gonna pretend as if nothing happened after this video
Scientology's marketing department had to take a lot of time to get this all figured out. Can't even imagine what Will could be going thru rn.
DAMAGE CONTROL
While I can appreciate that you posted this, and that you might understand now, the impact of your actions, this feels really impersonal. The production level is not necessary, it really distracts from what you're trying to say.  Like...you're "on set" giving this apology, when this is something that you're trying to personally convey. I don't know how willing most will be to accept this. It's not for us to accept, obviously, but I don't like this presentation.
Boo
He should have just stayed quiet.
No part of me thinks thats the way to do it. . . . . . . . Your son tweeted "Thats how we do it", maybe have a word to your kids about behaving like an adult.....after you learn to of course.
I had honestly forgotten about the incident 💀
He was wearing same cap when he met spiritual Guru Sadguru.
I forgive you, we all have made a bad decision. I will always support  you as a fan.
23 hours later:   91k likes  141k dislikes
You can definitely see here that Will just had to let it out. However, it was a selfish move in a way because he should have just kept this in while still reflecting. Chris clearly stated he wasn't ready. Yet, it was like Will didn't give a crap because he just had to anyway ! Like wtf
Every action will have a reaction
For me brother it was like MLK and Maclom X beefing doing the Civil Rights Movement. I have been a fan of yours since I was a kid. I mean I still listen to He's the Dj I'm the rapper.  Will we all make mistakes. I wish it never happened but it did. I don't know if you are going to read this or not. Just know brother time heals all wounds.
Looks like he was forced to apologize
We are all human..we still love you...we are still friends. Friends don't walk away when we do something stupid. They support you while you deal with the fall out.
I feel in my heart that is a good man and I really appreciate this a lot.
It's interesting (from the perspective of philosophy) and sad to an extent that how a moment of blind rage or anger can foreshadow the multiple decades of work you did and what people used to know you for.  No matter how sincerely apologetic Will is and even if Chris and Will come on good terms in near future, he'll forever be known for this one incident and not for decades of good movies and shows he has done.
Youtube hiding dislikes must’ve been great for controversial celebrities. Can’t imagine the real ratio on this video lol.
im not evan mad at him why are we so mad i thought it was kinda funny
It took him 3 months to cook up a simple apology; this is definitely scripted 😭
Lmfaoo
Не знаю английского языка. Но скажу ты МУЖИК настоящий, который может постоять за свою жену. Уважуха.
He's not doing anything to own up, it's just talk.
hancock was one of my fav movies growing up
well......who´s hungry?
Ahhh yes, the next viral apology video 💀
Somewhere in heaven Uncle Phil is giving him "the look".
Should have done this when people were defending him on social media. Rn it means nothing.
Si que eres un gran actor
You should have done this via interview where the interviewer can challenge all of your answers.
At this point after making a public display of negative emotion , you've made an attempt at a public display of apology. That's all you can do. Hopefully in the future we can get to see you and Chris work together on a project and make some money together while making history . I consider both of you guys Goats in your fields and 2 very respectable people. This too shall pass. We all are human. We all make mistakes. We all must live with the consequences of our mistakes and we all have the right to move forward from our mistakes. Stay strong.
I've watched this man all my life. My favorite TV show of all time probably is Fresh Prince. It's tough seeing him in this type of situation but he's human. He'll learn. I've been in intense fights with family and friends before. Even fists fights and in time we always come back. Friends again and laugh at it when we get older.  This is what I see this as. Give Chris time and if they're truly good friends they'll laugh about this year's later. Probably do a movie making fun about this whole mess 😅🤷🏻‍♂️
Anyone else getting Hancock vibes
#blamejada #baldheadedho #careerkiller
I hate to say this, but I am not convinced about this apology from Will... sounds fake. The guy didn't appear to be remorcefull at all.
You have been and still are a great man. You will lick this and be better after. Respect and good luck.
Lost all respect for this man. Won’t watch another film of his. 👎🏼
I feel for ya... you're a human with a good soul. <3
Better than the Travis Scott apology 👍🏽👍🏽
I don't forgive anything. You can rot away for all I care.
All the smiths thought he was clever when it happened until it made a financial impact on them then the humor wore off
Wow this is nearly the perfect youtuber apology video
Listen this at 1.5x and it totally feels like he's reading sh*t out of a transcript 🤣
this took way too long
I hope when you say you reached out to Chris to apologize to him, you didn’t ask him to appear on The Red Table Show coz if you offered that platform for healing, then you got to be joking because that platform is a safe space for you - I mean your family runs it. But if you just want to apologize privately and not have it televised, then that’s even better but Chris has to allow it. You are not entitled to be forgiven, I hope you know that but I believe when you are truly sorry and you apologize to someone you must accept that it’s not about you - it’s about the next person. So if you go into this looking for some of absolution or some sort of free pass from Chris on how you acted, then brace yourself for disappointment because it could happen that you don’t get any of those things. But if you go into this just genuinely sorry and remorseful, then even if you don’t get forgiveness, you will still feel good because forgiveness has to come from you first. Anyway, no love lost here Will, wish you the best in your journey and seriously next time if a similar situation happens I’m the future, just try to take deep breaths and weight out situation in head on how it would end in your head before you act impulsively. Then address matters like these on your own, because some time at the heat of the moment we lose sight of things that when we are normal state we end up realizing and you find out it’s too late. Other than that, you are a great man Will with his flaws and all and who is without flaws? Let them cast the first stone. And as the fans, this is not about us, and let the healing begin….
Just as Dhar Mann predicted 🤯
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
Comments didn’t pass the vibe check
I listened to The Smiths’ Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now. Had more sincerity in delivery.
74k  likes 77k dislikes  wasnt expecting that  but I'm not  surprised
Stop looking up to celebrities and focus on your life and your loved ones. Will Smith cares nothing about you or your loved ones--you don't enter his thoughts in the slightest. We use him for entertainment--he uses us for fame and fortune. It's that simple.
you can't tell me y'all are still "traumatized" by this mess. ridiculous
Cringe.
what was the point of this? 💀
And for people who are judging him...please do think on this, If each one of us would be judged for only one gesture, one mistake that we did and have our life destroyed for only that one time when we did wrong, it means it hell is already here. The only difference in his mistake and our daily mistakes is that the entire world could see when he did it wrong. So for all the preacher that are judging him, stop, you, i, we are not better then him.
Will, you are a great person and the time is lord of reason. Man, you are my hero, great actor and you have a lot of love in your heart, so much maturity in your head... You are not a bad person.,so don't push yourself to hardly. I'm sure that Brazil still loves you.. ❤️🇧🇷 And Chris, forgive this guy 'cause he didn't know what he was doing. God bless you all.
This was more like a YouTube video than a apology statement to me - sorry but this is not it
People, let's remember: "Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
You were the Prince of Bel Air, Will. Now you’re the king of youtuber’s apologies…
To little to late.
“Apology Video”  Don’t forget he’s an Actor
Some of his best acting yet.
"How come he don't want my apology man?!"
now we miss dislikes more than ever.
WILL YOU ARE A TRUE MAN FOR HAVING THE STRENGTH TO MAKE THIS VIDEO FOR EVERYONE!!   WE LOVE YOU WILL AND CHRIS!!!
You know it’s a YouTube apology when he started out the video with a huge sigh.
Thank you for saying that your actions were not justified at all. You are held to a standard that is indicative of the far-reaching influence you have. Accountability, repentance, penance, and lasting change.  Stick with the basic tenets and forget the new age lingo of supposed enlightened concepts that glitters but isn't gold.  The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. His Will be done.
Sad to say,but this is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted....😥
I’m honestly still in shock that Will ever did this. I’m still very very… stunned. I could name countless actors that I would think would do this before Will. I’m not even a full grown adult yet so this… I’m not sure if I dislike him now… I’ve always loved him and his movies but after this… I don’t know what I would do if I met him irl. I’m not sure if and when this could get somewhat better but if he says he’s going to commit to getting better then he’ll have to prove it. Will, we all make mistakes and that’s what makes us human, but people thought of you in higher regard. This will not get better within months, I’d be surprised if a year goes by and people still aren’t talking about it. Honestly I don’t know what else to say but… do better… it’s up to Chris
Nice touch with the white top, white cap and halo above the head, very angelic. I do believe he is truly sorry for doing what he did. Would have been nice though if he apologized to Wanda, Regina and Amy who were making history representing black women, gay women, all women, who had their iconic moment stolen because the only thing anyone will ever remember is Will Smith.
❤️❤️
I wish i could see how many dislikes this got
Y’know it’s a decent apology. Will didn’t shift blame to anyone and said that he was in the wrong. But it’s really up to Chris and Chris’s family to forgive him. But it’s good that Will accepted responsibility. And didn’t act like a child afterwards.
Respect
Think of all the people society has forgiven, are we really going to be this angry over *this* one moment?
You aren't actually sorry. You are just sorry it's gonna mess with your career. If anyone with less power than you did that on national TV, they'd be in jail. Stop trying to say you are sorry to the audience, we don't care you lost you chance with us. Say you are sorry to chris. He's the one who got hurt, he's the one who has to live it down, not us, him.
Apologies are a strong and right thing to do, you're a real man.
Giving a top tier actor several months to rehearse an apology? No way to truly tell if it's genuine - but in my opinion if it was from the heart, it wouldn't take this long to release an apology video
If you have the extension that shows dislikes, you will see something obvious in the numbers of this video
Acted better than movies 👍
The most half-assed apology ever 76k dislikes can tell you that lol
Im still big fan we are human we all make mistakes some greater than others what a lot of people didn't take into consideration was your emotional state at the time I think the fact that you had to talk about your father and your trials and tribulations of your personal life on your personal doc play The rolling at yeah I think you were emotionally vulnerable everyone should take that into consideration no one's perfect all we can do is. make right what once went wrong .
We all deserve forgiveness. We all fall short
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
This is weird
All act this dude ain't sincere! Chris should've press charge and sue this dude!!
Just retire with your millions, and go into the woods and be happy.
Very naughty boy and very unacceptable if anyone else did it they would be in prison you are lucky
if anyone wants to know there are 76k dislikes on this video
Seems like he's saying sorry because it's expected of him and damage limitation rather than because he feels he was in the wrong
Love you Will. We've all done some things that we wish we didn't and have to live it down. But there is life after mistakes. All good. One love!💜
The fact that Will is ALONE in this video is all u need to see here.
Bad apology. We don’t believe it. Stay away from acting and retire. We don’t want to see you again.
more dislikes
The poor black community and poor people in general of all  races  already have a bad stigma in America. This is not going to hurt Will  really he’s Rich . Why don’t you do something with your celebrity and resources to help some of us that are homeless .
Apologize to him personally not by choreography staged by your PR team. Looked up to you but now lost all respect 👎 good f’ing job
The moment will forever be remembered. Not sure an apology can fix that
Will smith a walking L. Lost all my respect for you Will. You messed up in the head
I realize that you’re human. But the apology doesn’t match the magnitude of this level of foul degrading on a prestigious platform. It’s revealing how your more affected by the public view of you instead of Chris.
NOPE
is it just me that feels like will got younger… like a child
Which apology is the worst? Will smith or Travis Scott
Surprised it only took 4 months of training to make a good apology for him.
C'mon man....get over it and just accept that you did it and move on
We are all humans, we ain't perfect but, we deserve a second chance.
Great promo placement of Just Water - v thirstay
Will wtf you doing this in public for?  internet apologies will never go well, but also the one person who deserves it most is Chris..  not "the audience".  Maybe all this effort should be going into doing a genuinly sweet and thoughtful gesture for Chris in his personal life...    If you're hoping the public stop making memes and teasing you about it once you apologise..  they wont. you already knew that.
76 THOUSAND DISLIKES LMAO WTF
People make mistakes every day as a person with mental health issues I’ve had my share. For everyone that is leaving negative comments or saying this apology isn’t sincere you don’t know that. You’re not walking in this man’s shoes you have no clue what he is going through or has gone through. It’s easy for you to judge someone behind a computer/phone screen but you don’t know crap of this man day to day mental stability. People make mistakes you and no one else is perfect what happen to one love especially when that person admits his damn mistakes? All you critics make me sick with the hate of you think his actions were bad you comments are no better. Shame on y’all.
Let’s move on and let two grown men settle a issue that is theirs not ours!
Great acting.  Wish you could give that kind of performance in your movies...
It's not my place to accept his apology or sit here in my high horse and judge. If you live out in the world you see many POS walking around with a facade of decency and alot them love to point the finger. What transpired was terrible, but I have flaws and won't spend any time chastising Will. Just hope that those he directed the apology to can accept & heal.
it took 4 months of script writing and apology training for this, huh, mr. smith....
…and Chris would have every right to NOT forgive you.
Maaan . We smack people everyday B . Even with mfs down the street . But he Will Smith … I guess . How ever y’all see it 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
With all these cutaways no wonder this video took four months! This editing is Aladdin (live action) levels of good!
Phony, fake, rehearsed … pathetic attempt to restart his career. He has such a huge ego this was all about him even now.  Wonder how much he paid the pr people to put together this scripted acting scene.  Teleprompter ….. just go away will smith.
ยังคง ยืนยังคำเดิม ว่า  อีกคนก็ควร สำนึกผิดด้วย
But you SHOULD feel ashamed.  You act like this is an accident that happened to you, too.  Nothing about this feels like an apology.
cringe🦆
btw for those without the "Return Youtube Dislike" extension: Its 74k Likes, 75k Dislikes
Will got that dog in'em
I stand with you CLM 🍋✊
Starting a YouTuber apology by sighing. You can't make this up.
Cap!!
Some of y’all act like y’all ain’t ever do something dumb or make a big mistake. At any age. Get a life. This is a blip on a man with an almost picture perfect career. Will we’re praying for you. Keep these words close to your heart Proverbs 24:16 “ for though the righteous fall seven times, they RISE. AGAIN, but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes.” KEEP GETTING UP. This will not define you. Be better, do better.
My respect for this man have fallen. Wake up man you are living a fake life.
Wil...look for Jesus he loves you more then you'll ever know...
Lol
Much respect for you Will. You are a good example. 👍
Being scared to be in trouble and being genuinely humble are two different things.
Will get that Westbrick hat off your damn head
no worries man
It’s that bald lady
Nice acting here, he should try Hollywood.
Doesn't matter how genuine the apology is, the youtube community is extremely toxic and just have this mindeset that all apology videos are bad.
Such a weird weird video
Big Willy, this will never leave you. Ya done goofed up big time
We don't judge you! We love you! Much love from Romania!❤
He gotta do this, 4 months later. Because he got himself recently a movie deal.  I bet you $100 it's on the contract that he needs to publicly apologize
Não errou em nada, ele foi totalmente desrespeitoso
To me this sounds like he lost every movie deal he had going and is just trying to weasel his way back in. It sounds pathetic.
A new video for PewDiePie to react to.
bro why is this being drawn out to this degree? I like to believe it’s because will smith is actually black. white actors have done significantly worse on screen and behind the scenes.
Bruh, he didn't even do anything wrong. People need to stop getting their panties in a bunch
Wherever u r at, whatever u r doing, PLEASE remember that I (we- if I could) are here for u. Defining COOL for all cultures and races in the 90's. Still talk about everyone wanting to be just like u! Not like Mike lol! I can't thank u enough for letting me be apart of ur world, thru the fresh prince, and all ur BLOCKBUSTER movies! I got to escape my tragedies and HOPE  for something soooo much more cause of u. Still here and never leaving!!!!
thank you Will. I am glad you're willing to admit this mistake. I hope things between you and Chris can slowly heal with time.
If you have the dislike extension you can see that there is almost a perfect 50/50 with the likes and dislikes
As a professional actor who can cry on demand, Will has almost had us here. Almost.
The real question is, would he... rewind time?
Man!  Have I made some mistakes! Chin up Will!  I got lucky because the whole world didn’t see them.  Once the consequences subside you’ll be better for the wear.  The ONLY advice I have is, FING OUT WHO THIS JESUS IS. He will make all things New.  Just remember He’s God…. Not you.
he sounds like a robot ToT he forgets the word family for a second lol "umm, fa...mi..ly"
who cares?
worst apology vid ever, every thing feels like a skit jajajaj
The new wild wild west 2 looks lit as f*ck
black
Na bruh rookie mistake. Get a dog and go to Jim . Best way to apologize.
This is ridiculous 😒
He might as well have said "This is Jada's fault, she is a tyrannical woman, I must please her."  Would have generated more sympathy than this sad little performance.
Sooo fake
Watch out for socks for 1
After his 4 month time skip training arc, he finally mastered the art of internet apologies
Of course everyone wants to pick apart his apology... its not that deep especially since we weren't directly involved. He's not perfect, he made a huge mistake,   he seems genuinely remorseful. Let it be. Learn to stop putting ppl on pedestals and respect ppls humanity and all its flaws.
An apology is not enough. You have to marry one of Chris family members..
I forgive you and I think Chris deserved it.
All men have instinctual anger but it is much stronger in black men and women which makes it a higher risk for the general population to commingle with them.
Nice try.. nice try.
Will Smith that like button!
After 4 months. Fake apology for damage repair. Sad.
Didn’t even say he crossed the line
Where’s G.I. Jane at??😂😂
Perfect apology vid, bro.  Hey:  NOBODY is perfect.  You fucked up and you owned up.  Anybody who still holds a grudge prolly lives in Daddy's basement.  "To err is human."  You have EXACTLY the right attitude.  You made a major stupid mistake, right...but this does not make you a BAD GUY.  You are owning your mistake, you are taking responsibility, and you are still a major amazing guy in my book.  Carry on and take care, my man.
why.  is. it that American. overdramatize everything
don't understand so much hateness on him the motivation was he tried to protect someone he love
Either he is truly apologizing or he is a really great actor.
Hard to tell
CRRRIINNNGGGEEEE lmao this is so dumb
why he sound like he's reading from a teleprompter lmao
Its been 4 months , people honestly forgot everything
I forgive you Will. 🙂
Will, I had so much respect for you as an actor and as a human. I grew up watching you and this one incident has really shown the real you, and to this day, I can't even go back and see anything with you : ( a legacy, a legend, a role model tarnished forever.
I meant Will Smith in Cleveland Ohio at a GameStop one time he had two bodyguards with them they tried to bum rush me he stopped them and said she's a fan they make me who I am after that I will always love him forever
I still love you will 😁
This took 4 months rehersal... The sigh at the beginning was on point , truly a masterful bit of acting .  Streamy award nominations incoming
At the start..I believed him. Then I remembered he’s a professional actor..
L smith
Beta Smith
I think he is punished enough now,he should be forgiven and should given a chance again to prove himself,get his life back again ,Chris should also forgive him,hug it out they are both affected by it and won't heal until they genuinely hug it out
What would Jesus do???
WE IN THIS TOGETHER  CLM!   🍋✊ #CLM
Real eyes realize REAL lies 🙏
L Will, shouldn't have apologized
Reads the first question like a robot nope I'm done I hope Chris never speaks to you
LLLLL
Its obvious that you want to save youre carrier but its dead and you allways be remembered for that mistake
Have you asked God for forgiveness? For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. I pray that this will open the door for you to establish a relationship with God and heal you. That is the ultimate apology and seeing this in you will open doors that you didn’t even know existed.
I still think this was Jada's fault lmao that woman is clearly not worth the time
Will peaked at fresh prince. All downhill since then.
I believe you Will. Many people do. You made a mistake and you are aware of it. Chris though is the bigger man still for maintaining the high road. Chris is a good man and he was raised well. In due time, he will forgive you. Your friendship will survive to a greater level simply because he is a good guy. The fact that he did not show you his knuckles, is testament to it. Time Will heal you both.
I remember a time when Will Smith was a funny and happy guy who just wanted to have fun in life now he's so dramatic all the time he's clearly not a happy man but I really hope he can overcome his problems and be that happy guy we all use to like
Whoever’s reading this, I hope that everything gets better and if your struggling with stuff remember the future is bright!
me when my parents make me apologize to my siblings
Will : i haven't got a movie offer in 4 months, this is bad , gotta drop a video
I need a few more minutes.  Too late, Will…. And also too soon.  And why are you wearing a hat?!  🧐
For anyone wondering about the dislikes  I have a modded YouTube So the dislikes are around 74k as of now I'll update every day
The world takes this kind of crap so personal when it has nothing to do with them. This man needs far more self exploration than he realizes.
Why the need to make this public? Perhaps it would have been more impactful if you'd made an apology video to Chris and Chris alone. That way it would have come across as being more sincere.
This is just a bit too late. if you need a few months to understand what you have done was wrong, you really need help man.  you don't need to look nice and have a nice set. be humble. be truthful.  that is what people want to see from you. not a weird scripted video with perfect lighting and someone deciding what you wear to look more sad
A multi cam apology. A poster with "the world is sick love is the cure".  Water product placement? Give me a break.
is anyone curious if this video is monetizing off views?
Choreographed, not a sincere apology.
Praying for you will you're human we all make mistakes
Who asked for this? Like seriously
Will Smith is a tool.  Loved his autobio up until it stopped being about Will Smith the Human, and started being about Will Smith the MegaSuperstar
This feels ai generated.
You probably won't see this one comment among so many, but I want you to know that I didn't feel let down at all. In fact, you helped me. I think those of us who are committed to letting our soul shine as an example to others of what they also have within them can easily forget that how we handle our mistakes can be just as important an example for light and doing good, if not moreso. Additionally, it's a lot harder to convince screwed up people that they have a light to shine if they never see that we're screwed up, too. The way you handle being a human example may well be a stronger testimony than all your years as a divine example. I was so happy to hear you say "remorse without shame." I hope you talk more about that because I think that's a big factor holding people back from having faith that their soul is just as perfect and beautiful as everyone else's. Finally: I've been writing messages I feel led to put out there, which I'm nearly ready to do. As much as I'd love my writing to benefit as many people as possible, the idea of any attention spilling onto me is not terribly appealing. I don't know how you manage to carry the weight of expectations of so many people. Your experience will stick with me as a reminder for how the ego can still jump out and sabotage us no matter how long it's been since we last lost control. I'm glad you're spending time in introspection because I really think that when things like this happen, it's signalling a way in which our ego is wounded and needs our loving care. I fervently hope you'll continue to share your process as an example of how to love ourselves unconditionally through mistakes just as we do for others. Keep shining, Will Smith. Being human only makes the soul stronger and more beautiful ❤️
No Women No Cry
Accountability is hard. Will isn't taking the easy road. Keep holding up the light, brother. Even when you stumble. Keep holding up the light.
Was that a goddamn Just Water product placement
What does CLM stand for ?   Chris’s Life Matters ???
the tension and gritting of will’s mouth show he’s angry not sorry. angry he has to apologize, angry we won’t move past it, who knows….i don’t buy this at all.
Lets be honest. best way to squash it would be a celeb boxing match with Chris getting a free one to start.
The PR firm earning their keep and fee!
will this is good but you forgot your dog you nearly nailed it who was your youtube apology trainers
Everyone makes mistakes. Will deserves a 2nd chance. Much love Will and all the best 4 thd future.
Zee vill eet zee bugz
Any other profession, one would have been fired with few prospects for another decent job. Good luck coming back from that. He made a very bad decision.  So he, like any average person who makes a very bad decision, also needs to move on.  At least he has lots of money and hasn't lost a livihood.....which the average person would loose after doing what he did.
I’m still gonna watch the fresh prince of bel air if that’s what your worried about
People make mistake it's normally
your pr team is great! you not so much..
Boycott this guy's movies/content forever... this is so scripted it is embarrassing...
Cpm
This is definitely a good start though. I’ll give him that 👍🏾
Will Smith has been and continues to be so vulnerable and transparent about his own work and healing journey. And it all seems incredibly genuine.  May his work be fruitful.
A lot of these comments are giving me the those without sin should be the only ones casting these stones vibes ……….………………………………………………….……..       A preacher gave a sermon this past week and said: the reason the black community loses all its hero’s is because we have been conditioned to believe  when they aren’t perfect we should disown them. As if we do not realize they are actually human.  This doesn’t excuse the wrong act they did but it should extend grace. Wrong is wrong but we can make amends and learn from our mistakes. I am interested in Will’s journey of continuing to live a purpose full/filled life.
Seeing Will smith apologize with deep thinking makes me go "Ahhh , Das Hot"
He said he wants to apologize, but never did.
I’m sure most of the apologies we ego based humans give could be better across tho board haha   Celebrity or not!
Wtf does CLM mean
I'm Goooooing too...
I farted
Everything is choreographed - from the green lighting, the different changing camera angles, and the "love is the cure" poster. Acting like he is taking spontaneous questions from fans. He still stinks of anger from the slights he perceives from Chris.
Something about this feels so forced
WHATS UP DUDE
No one is perfect ,One step at a time  (good on ya will ).
Being famous isn't easy. If this was just a normal joe, it probably would have ended up in a brawl and/or the friendship was lost. For Will, his whole career is in jeopardy and the incident will never be forgotten by everyone in the whole world. Now that is some heavy stuff.
If everyone could own up to their messes like this, the world would be a much better place. Let's all take note. ❤️
No matter what all the haters say, I think we all need to truly accept that Will is human and none of us are perfect. Most human reactions could be done a better way. If every shitty reaction I had was in the spotlight I’d feel like total crap!
Will… this is not being truly open, vulnerable, or genuine… ur thinking too much… go spend time ALONE in nature!!!! you need to find ur joy again philly bro <3 luv.
in my situations where even physical outbursts have been necessary... apologies are not.
Does it take this long to apologize?? Really bruh??
Finaly
you’re human it’s all good we’re all not perfect and i hope chris and his family forgives you
Nah. Best actor. Fake apology.
I hope you and Chris get good again. You are both role models to many boys (most of us are men now) here in Brazil: he is the li'l dude from across the street, and you Will be forever our Fresh Prince of Bel Air!
Only Will knows if he is sincerely sorry for what he did. We can only guess....
in my position... I cannot take sides in this situation because I understand Chris is a name just as Will is a Name. I will not be changing my name to Chris any time soon or ever for that matter.
Love you Will. Thank you. Childhood me needed this.
I am the only child of a single parent. My mother.  As a woman, she gave me the love, care and support throughout all of my endeavours. However, I soon realised that I needed a male figure/s to help me navigate the world.  Mr Will Smith, you have been one of those figures to me. I have learnt so much from all of the light, inspiration and positive energy that you have been placing into the universe.   As you said, you are human, as we all are. No one should expect you be be perfect. That's simply unfair.  Please, I beg of you Mr Smith l, don't let that incident stop/change from being that beacon of light and love of a person you have been and are.  I love you and am looking forward to the difference of what your career have to offer to this universe.   Wishing you, and your family all best that the world has got to offer.
Lmao. He used a generic YouTuber apology template. How original how sincere 🙄🤣
Dont worry. People will talk. As long as you do what you feel you gotta do thats all that matters. I support the healing process 🤍
Oof
Sorry bro... nope  Keep pushing 💪
Even the best of people make mistakes (my father) you put on a pedestal. Yours just happen to be in front of millions of people.... You are human just like everyone else no matter how much money and fame you have. I am sure Chris will accept your apology and his family will do the same over time. Anyone who drags it further like the Academy or other actors is just looking for 15 more minutes of fame. This apology is accepted...... you will never please everyone...... please go on with your life from this point nothing more for you to say on this.....
I love u so much what u do wrong.. i don't care... every one as a turning point in life...and your in half of your life journey(50)..do what u think. Peace
We forgive you Will. We are all human and sometimes we fucked up. We are not perfect. Come back strong.
Lol
0:10 not the sigh 💀😭
I forgive you. I hope you find Jesus Christ.
To anyone saying this is a honest or dishonest apology STOP You don't know that in fact nobody know's that. The only thing that know's is time and only the time can tell if somebody learned from their mistake or not.  So just move on from this mess and let time speak  by itself.
I was the biggest Smith fan! Born in 93’. It was Will Everything. With that said , I don’t know these weird Hollywood people. Will is over with for me. I can’t even casually watch his movies. Other than Independence Day. It is July… but yeah. Celebrities are played out. In real life a man would have fought him and or worse…. Unacceptable. N I don’t care how many jungles and drugs he does to find him self. BYE. I didn’t even realize I was still subbed. Not anymore. Inflation is up 10%… no one cares will… your a bully and you kids are hella weird. Won’t have my kids looking at their crap either…
Alternative title: its been 4 months
Why apologize at YouTube? And after 4 month? It's like apologize only after the backlash hurt.  Also I dont think your apologize is sincerely enough if you're doing it at YouTube. seem like you just want to address to public backlash. If you do it right after, not 4 months later, it might felt different.  Anyway if you really want to apologize, you SHOULD meet him FACE2FACE not via email, chat, WhatsApp, or youtube. Dont make any excuse, coz you could just show up at his show. Drop that pride of yours.
I believe you and I still admire you!!!!!!! 💓
One of the most entitled actor in the world. Always thinking that the world revolves around him. Shame on you.

no shot he did a youtube apology vid 💀💀
❤️
What would uncle phill do?
You made a mistake and you are taking responsibility, I  have the upmost respect for you and you are STILL my favorite actor. Thank you for being an example 🖤
Fake apologies. You are awful, awful. Will never ever watch a movie where you work again. It sounds like “ok, Chris, I’m waiting for you”. That gesture when he says “Chris I apologize to you” is so disgusting….
Weak
I've never hated anyone until you
This is hardly an apology IMO. It’s Damage control if anything.
Great work Will. Well done for making this video. But its not us making the decision to accept your apology.. let see what Chris says and do. Wish you both the very best and hope you have done EVERYTHING possible to make that up to Chris.
Meme himself YAAAAAH its rewind time
God damn simple tom
So, has this dude divorced that evil narcissist who destroyed his mental health yet?
Here i wish we can see how many dislikes this video got lol
Will still the goat 💯
this is pathetic
I expected way more depth from you Willis.
He really needs to get a new PR team if they thought the sigh was the best way to open an apology video.
A cannibal is someone who is fed up with people.
This isn't the worst apology guys. It's not dramatic. It's not overreacting. The o ly bad thing about this is that Will thinks it's mostly the fans to apologize to
CLM 4LIFEEEE😤
How embarrassing
Chris has to make the decision to forgive. However, this scripted speech doesn't help. Let Oprah do an interview calmly, factually, and publicly.
4 months later… I forgot
Why now? And not a week after fx. Strikes me as weird timing
Still look up to you my guy. You did way too much over the years for me to wash it all away over a single moment when we idolize "heroes " who have done far worse.
the memes are going to be hillarious
Plenty of good role models out there. We need to forget about this guy
uh oh.... richard
Those were great words Will ❤️
LMFAOO
Real men take accountability 💪🏾😤
“Keep my wife’s name out to F ING Mouth.”
Okay but like Pokémon Go needs to make a comeback 🤷🏽‍♂️
we love you Will, always have.
Why not just talk to him directly instead of turning it into a publicity stunt? This could have been a private conversation.
Bro what does clm mean

You can tell how sincere he is by how they made this video a full-on production with "fan submitted" questions that his staff probably actually wrote lol
Just imagine if Chris calls back and says "I forgive you Will", and Will says "Get my wife's name outta yo effing mouth" again 😂 This would make a good movie scene 😅
Bring back the dislike button count NOW
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
THIS COMPLETES THE YOUTUBER CAREER CYCLE.
oooh thats a 9/10 sigh right there in the intro
Will Smith  is a W
I feel your authenticity, Will. Yes, we all make mistakes.
Did you seriously put a halo around your head?
Apology Accepted, kahit na Isa ako sa mga nadisappoint ni will Smith sa ginawa niya kasi hinahangaan ko siya pagdating sa mga pelikula,    Di ko lang alam kung bakit May mga tao pa sa comment section na gumagawa ng spekulasyon o theory sa apology video ni Will na hindi raw mukhang apology which is nakakatanga
I'm a white dude, but I'm a dedicated and brave defender of BLM ✊
It’s too bad that Will doesn’t know one of the most important rules of YouTube, which is that you should NEVER make an apology video. There is absolutely no way to win unless you’re Pewds or Mrbeast
tbh he isn't even being a good actor at this. What I'm seeing 90% of the time on this video is him speaking through his teeth trying to contain his anger towards everyone who disapproved of his animalistic outrage lmao
Yes, your behaviour was unacceptable, it still is. Too little, too late. All respect is gone
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself."  He literally just said he doesn't feel shame for what he did and that he only feels bad because of the consequences.  This is blatant damage control. Even if what he says is completely sincere, it's disgustingly self serving.
Uncle Phil is straight up mad with you son. However he thanks you for your apology.
we stand with u gang
I don't want to be rude, but are you FINALLY going to divorce that she demon. She seems to love a memory of a dead man than you. And you are a catch. Just let go of her man.
❤️❤️❤️
This is giving Logan Paul apology video vibes but that’s just me
Lol who even cares anymore
'Public Enemy - Don't Believe The Hype' was playing in the bg of my mind  you don't ask for forgiveness... you earn it  Wealth & success doesn't bring happiness... EGO's certainly do not either... take those people you know who could benefit from your help from every corner of this world and simply help them... that's the way to heal a broken heart. Perhaps, forgiveness will come then. 'Perhaps'.  Whatever these big over-inflated celebs do right or wrong.. the most beloved are those who use their own luck and shine a little of it on those who never had any.  Way forward Will... actions speak louder than words.  Amen
its ok
What we see is a 100% begrudging publicity stunt lmao might as well have read from a text prompt
No comment
W will
Here is the dilemma.... I can see real, raw pain in Will's eyes. He is embarrassed and ashamed and most likely reliving his days of feeling helpless to his dad's treatment of his mom.... What he did to Chris was more horrific, because it was taped, caught on film forever and to top it off Chris was bullied.... What I say is the two men get together, talk, cry, hug somewhere for a few days, and Will take some of his money to create more outlets for those who have suffered childhood trauma. He can't erase what he did but he can do something to help ease the pain of others...... On a funny note, He should let Chris get three shots to the face. real talk.
I Forgive You Will Smith!!!  We All Make Mistakes in Life!!!
We love you and forgive you will ❤️❤️❤️ we’re all human and make mistakes!! It’s apart of our journey
Will pronounces all of his SILL - AH - BULLS
Will can you hook me up with 10 grand... im broke homie
Not forgiven
You've had several months to rehearse this.
hmm
Bro its been 4 months we all dont care anymore
PAY THAT MAN! 💰💰💰
Hostage video vibes
Had 4 months to do this. He started to try and get back on track with his acting and he still fairly copped flack so of course he had to apologise. Is it genuine? I’d say 50/50. Either way the man is in his 50s and it shouldn’t of happened in the first place. Hope Chris and his family find some peace and that Will has truly learnt something… who knows though.
Lame
yeah, gonna take a few years to come back from this one bud
Is he reading a teleprompter?
Just do us favor and remember  the words on that sign that is on your wall the world is sick love is the cure
We missed you my bf was asking about you yesterday .I'll never stop being your friend !!
Nope.
I think Will should be punished for his actions, he should be humiliated and wiped and thrown to the lions, don't you think? Well I don't think so, yes what he did was wrong, yes he should and have apologized, yes C.Rock should accept his apologies, this is a great moment for C.Rock and Will to show the world what been ONE means as a human race. We all do mistakes in life, we all need some forgiveness at some point and level of life, we all need to be Will and C.Rock right now, Will and C.Rock show us what's it all about. Thank you
He's a human. We're all fallen, we all do things we aren't proud of and live to regret it. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Never act again will!
We forgive Will. There’s no good in holding grudges or hate. We all make mistakes. Now we gotta learn from them.
rest in peace will smith ❤️
I’ve admired you since I was a little kid, and still do. You are human, and that is ok. Please continue to be gentle to yourself through this process. Much love to you and yours.
I feel like this is staged !
It was just a heat of the moment type situation. Terrible timing sure, but it happens and sometimes men go to extremes to defend the women they love. Forgiveness is one of the most important parts of life, and I hope everyone involved is able to find it in themselves.
I Support you Will! Everyone makes mistakes and you will get past this !!!! 💯
I still think it was fake.
To err is human…
Will Smith is only 3 and a half months late on this! Which makes it a whole lot of "too little, too late".
Will...Im sorry man. I know this must have been hard for you to do this but what happened that Night, what you did what you caused it made what was suppose to be about YOU...because of youre actions it was no longer about YOU, you hurt everyone and Personally Disrespected someone in front of the Whole and they didn't deserve that.   I love you Man, I know it was mistake and I believe in you but just remember after what happened that Night...it stopped BEING ABOUT YOU. When we mess up and cause a mess, we don't focus on why we messed. No, we just start cleaning up the Mess we made and as were cleaning up or fixing our mistakes we LEARN from there. We acknowledge we FVCKED UP but we ADMIT to our flaws and our mistakes and apologize to those we effected or hurt. That's how we grow...I hope you find a way to reach Chris, and do what you should've done the Day after that Night.
Script 3/5 Acting 3/5
Will studied the art of YouTube apology.
$ is king
He was fogged out.  The lie detector confirmed that was a lie.  No part of him thinks that was an appropriate way to act.  The lie detector confirmed that was a lie.  Shame is a emotion that we have for a reason I instead of trying not to feel it. Actually feel it and learn from it. We are a culmination of our decisions in life. Good or bad take accountability for what you do.
I LITERALLY HATED Will Smith after what he did.  But I am a husband and I will forgive him.  I Forgive him.  I have to, he messed up and he knows it.  Damn, sometimes we wake up after we make mistakes.  But we still have to make the mistakes to heal.
WE LOVE YOU WILL!!
You can’t fake the emptiness in his eyes.
Will Smith could be a good YouTuber.  ‘Cause he perfectly captured the feeling of a public apology.
Sad.
They should've asked him ytf he laughed in the first place
Please, man... Get yourself checked... You don't look well... Looks like you haven't slept since that day...
Y’all mfs don’t let no one down😂
I’m glad you finally addressed this but it really took a long time. I hope you have taken that time to reflect on your life, your relationships and the best road forward. Wishing you and your family and Chris and his family peace
Missed you Will, can't wait til you fully return back to the light. take your time.
Wtf is CLM?
A man who doesn’t have a handle on his emotions is not much of a man
Stop talking about Chris. Stop talking about reaching out to him or apologizing to him. He owes you nothing.
ur apology gay
Classic YouTube apology video. Start video with a sigh and slow walk to the couch.
I thought it wasn't really a big deal, lol
We ain't moved on yet? Ight, cool.
Thought he was finally going to acknowledge his toxic relationship…
Thank you for taking the time to put this together and taking the time to address the masses. I commend you for looking within to understand the root of why you reacted the way you did and to grow from this experience. It's important to forgive yourself as part of the healing process. I applaud you for being vulnerable time and time again. I hope others can extend grace and see your sincerity and authenticity. You're a good person.
I personally feel like Will is such an incredible actor, it’s hard for me to believe what he is saying is true/sincere.
Your favourite month starting Monday 😅
I think most of us has already forgot that this even happened, but here we are, I guess.
So back to uploading without coming down in the comments? Or talking with your fans? You gonna have to start overrrrr
It's aight Will, jus don't do it again.
I love u will get better soon and love u please do what’s is truly best for you
Te amo Will!
Tears of a clown.
get a grip mah
Eres el mejor!!!!!
After the first half i gotta say this is one of the best apology videos ive seen on this platform
I feel this entire situation is overdramatized and ironic how many people act as though they are in a position to cast judgement or pretend like they’ve never made mistakes. His were public and yours are hidden. It’s easy to be cowardly behind a computer screen but everyone has their day.
Fake apology. You partied after >> You have no shame, yet alone humility You're a bad person l.
From the perspectives of people who grew up on The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Everybody Hates Chris, it was really sad.
What a youtuber apology ever 🤣🤣🤣
I was surprised Will didn’t wear a baggy sweater while sitting on a bean bag chair when he made this video
It's been months lol
we love you , we are human, all the time we commite mistakes, but  we are better every time ! let  go that situation... !! <3
BETA.....
this is kinda embarrasing lmao
After all.....everyone deserves a second Chance....including you....
Forever supportive of you … stay strong
You had months to rehearse this. This isn’t genuine.
Will…you made a mistake, you’ve acknowledged that mistake and have apologized to All. Those who love you will continue to love you and route for you. Keep your head up and continue working to be the best that you can be. Your new journey has just begun and again…those who love you will look forward in sharing that journey with you.
That’s the Will Smith I grew up with. Peace brother.
Seguís siendo esa persona a quien respeto por tu profesión, son errores y es difícil de superar....pero lo superaras! gracias por esas palabras que nos regalaste, CREO EN TÍ. You are still that person whom I respect for your profession, they are mistakes and it is difficult to overcome....but you will overcome it! Thank you for those words you gave us, I BELIEVE IN YOU.
@WILL TBH U HAVE TAUGHT ME TO GROW AND BE CONFIDENT AND FREE JUST BY BEING UR TRUE SELF FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE! UR HUMAN AND HAD A FKD UP MOMENT, IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE TIMING... HAD IT BEEN IN A NIGHT CLUB ONE NIGHT OR A PARKING LOT OF SOME BIG BDAY BASH IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS BIG OF A DEAL AS IT HAS BECOME. UR TALENTED AND OBVIOUSLY HUMBLE IN UR OWN WAYS, SO JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD BC CHRIS PROBABLY FORGAVE U THAT SAME NIGHT SEEING HOW HE CHOSE NOT TO BAD MOUTH U @CHRIS GOD BLESS UR HEART FOR BEING SUCH A HUGE GIANT IN ALL OF THIS! WE ALREADY HAVE ENUFF REAL LIFE CHAOS AND CRISIS GOIN ON AROUND THE WORLD FOR US TO WASTE TIME PULLING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS! THE WORLD NEEDS MORE PEACE! MAYBE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD A MSG OF LUV TO THE WORLD 🌎✌🏼THAT 2 PPL CAN MAKE A MENDS DESPITE THE SEVERITY OF ACTION 🎬
I think compensation to Chris based on what this video makes for being monetized seems to be like the logical thing to do.
Ok Smill With  Ratio+Smillsihter
Disgraceful. 4 months for this?
This is kind of pride month ngl
I for one believe that he means every last word of what he just said and he's trying to make things right.
"It's all fuzzy...". Eloquent.
God Bless you. The hardest work anyone can do is the working on oneself. I’ve been a supporter of both you and Chris since I can remember. Time heals everything. Things will workout in everyone’s favor, and workout for the best.
bro I almost care I’m close but I dont
You’re good will. It honestly didn’t effect my life in any capacity. Hope Chris can find it in his heart to forgive you and not be what most stand up comedians are… Petty. (Funny, but they’re still petty.)
She told you how to act and you listened. You would’ve known she’d be upset or not. You figured she’d be happy. She told you exactly what to do by her reactions in your relationship. You’re still caught in her webs and until you free your mind, you’re a shell of a person, unfortunately. This is your moment to realize what you’re involved in with her, unfortunately it’s fleeting.
TOO LATE
Keep doing right moving forward.
Maybe it's all a stunt to sell his book?
Horrible video
Im a fan of will smith, all right? But if you make a apology video means you just want your credibility back
We love you Will!! We always will! You made a HUGE mistake, it was embarrassing and you cant take it back. Show me a human who has never made such a bad mistake and I'll show you a liar... Let's grow and heal together as a human race! We are hanging on with you will! Keep on keeping on!❤❤
HE- HE SAID THE S WORD
Thanks for doing this on my 19th birthday 🎂
What is with this “# CLM ✊🍋” thing going on in the comments? Can someone explain it to me?
I took you 3 months to apologize?
He had a weak moment as we all do. Shout out to will for waiting for the moment to pass before addressing it. This felt more genuine then anything he could have said the day after. He saw everyone’s opinion, thought about them, and responded.
Bro found a way to monetize his apology. SMH
Ayy bro you rich and famous. Like we need an apology.....
Honestly who cares
I've let people down. I've made huge mistakes. I've hurt people emotionally, never physically but I been offered forgiveness and I offer that to you. Everyone makes mistakes. Sure Chris needs his time but the public was also let down by Will's actions so I think it's cool for us to offer him forgiveness. It's time to move on, or at least try to. 💯✌Life is short.
Good lord he’s back
We do not care
Times like these where I wish we could see the dislike count
This needs to be studied…. The fakeness all around on so many levels is amazing to see.
Will Smith FRIED ASF
Argo
Publicity stunt🤣🤣🤣Hollywood
This is none of our business, dog.
I was shocked to see a new update from Will Smith. 😨
why is there an ad for your book underneath the comments lol. if you’re apologizing why are you trying to pump more revenue still. i accept and fully believe what he’s saying but damn i saw the money grab after and was confused
I know that he prolly doesn't read these comments, but I'm really sorry that ever since then I don't look at Mr Smith the same way! I just see an @$$******* In every way! And it sucks being a fan and all!!
Na ahh, all I see is good acting, damage control and manipulative loaded language. If this was a couple week after even a few I’d be more accepting but not after 4months na ahh you deserve the fall from grace
I was very angry with you, Will, until this apology(as if you care, lol) It seems very sincere and I pray that you and Chris can mend this “rift”, it was not a good look but God’s got you guys. Be blessed.
It’s almost like people who act for a living also live the act? No one cared about the awards this year because Hollywood is producing nothing but dumpster fires, so what do they do? Manufacture some drama to insure engagement, whether it’s negative or positive it’s views and revenue.
I LOOOOOVE how you've taken a moment to get clear on everything, and now taken full responsibility for your actions, with no excuses, and apologized!!! I wish more men were like you! This world would be a better place. We have all done things as adults that we regret. He who is without sin, let him throw the first stone! I accept apology and I will be a FOREVER fan!
10 years was definitely excessive
You can't take back what you've done and you are fake Will. I used to look up to you and now I can only look down.
question that shoulda been asked is why u was laughing too if anything voldemort should be up here apologising
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WTH CLM IS
All you people disliking this are crazy, if the man wants to say his piece let him. you can't all act like your perfect nobody is he's allowed to make mistakes in life.
Oh man you gotta love celebrities, they provide some good entertainment 😂
A humble heart is the most beautiful thing in humanity. You have one and it shows.
We all make mistakes, but as they always say," You do the crime, you do the time." He didn't do his time...
Lol what we have to do with forgiving him , let Chris decide
Force à toi
No way he pulled out the YouTuber apology video BWAHAHAHAHAH
Your late Will!
In terms of youtuber apologies, this one might be the best, unironically.
Still supporting you Will. No one is without actions that they regret. Stay strong and continue to be you. 💪🙏
Christ is knocking at your door.
Gg’s
love the "Just Water" ad placement. No shame in making more money.
His apology took too long, sorry. I think that he is strategizing on behalf of his career. Just like we have jobs, actors jobs is too make movies and show up on TV in order to make money an pay the bills.
Such vulnerability. Check out Blank Kanvas podcast.
Saying you reached out to Chris and he’s not ready to talk and you are now talking - this is about you and not your actions but your reputation. Own it - you were wrong. He doesn’t need to meet/talk/forgive you. This is on you.
Lollllllll love it when actors give apologies. Still love your movies bruh.
good act
Sorry doesn't cut it man. You damaged your character permanently in front of the entire world and showed us how weak you really are
LOL THIS IS ALL CAP!
Love you, Will!! ❤️❤️❤️
Meh
He should not have worn his hat. People might think he is using this to sell his merch
wow 68k dislike ... and to think youtube remove the dislike counter ...enk NOT....
It hasn't been a minute
Mos t ha peci qa thojn me maa nguc grun mu ju kisha flug me kerr me shkel e jo me rrok shpull

😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣
celeberity culture more like
Do it again, I bet you won’t
The uncle in Bel Air can't save you here Will. You messed up my man.
It was unfortunate that it happened. Instead of turning my back on you, I saw that your actions were the result of a man who has been troubled.   I hope this has opened your and your family's eyes to your internal pain and struggle.   I know the look of someone who is battling the enemy.
Will, I greatly appreciate you coming out about this matter. Just the other day I thought to myself about how quiet it is on your end of the spectrum. You made a bad choice in the past. We all do. Not one single soul walking this earth is perfect. We all make mistakes. But it is how we react, how we build upon those mistakes that determines who we are. I believe you just got caught up in the moment. It is okay. I've acted before thinking too. Everyone has at one point or another. Regardless of all of that, you are a human. You are allowed to have anger, sadness, happiness etc. Personally, I forgive you. I have always looked up to you ever since I first saw you in a movie, which was Men in Black. I won't let some public humiliation change that.
Iv missed u sm man happy to see u again love all your movies n all your content man real happy to see u on again
Bruhh, who cares anymore....literally forgot this dude existed
lol no
Your apology is irrelevant. We are only interested in knowing whether you have begun psychotherapy for your anger and aggressivity.
Actions speak louder than words, sir. Making amends is a tough task and only time will tell if you're up to it.
You did nothing wrong
Jaden's gonna be disappointed... This ISN'T how we do it.
He needed 4 months of anger management.
I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologise.
This should have been private not on YouTube!
We have all made mistakes and done things without thinking 1st...Will u made a mistake u are human people need to stop judging people and let that man fix his mistake...damm who haven't done something they are not proud of...Will keep your head up and keep moving forward and whoever dont understand kick rocks damm..I love you always have always will...
another youtube apology...
Will smith is cnn fake news! Sent by his pr team.
bro just say sorry💀💀
No
Leave that evil women bro, she doesn’t love you. Never has.
Moments of passion can be good or bad but Will handled his poorly. His insecurities showed and quite frankly to be such a public figure and do that on live television broadcast means he needs to change his situation.
I think he should have waited until Chris accepts his apology. This feels like a publicity stunt for himself.
😮😮❤❤
I remember looking up to this dude. I used to think he was emotionally balanced and positive. F#ck happened to you Will?
We all need more kindness & grace✌️💕
4:16 - It looks like he is almost trying to hold back a laugh.......
Read off of teleprompter much?
It takes strength and courage to finally doing this. It takes patience and faith to wait for Chris to reach out to you now.
This person always tries to do something new and extraordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next video,Love you.🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍
I respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best peace that I have ever seen on YouTube hats of to you love your videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This person always tries to do something new and extraordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next video,Love you.🥰
4 months and it's still an awful apology video, amazing.
you still aint done nun wrong to me
I can't wait for pewdiepie to review this apology video
I know that Will  made mistakes and he’s a human being and I forgive him , he was right  we’re human beings we made mistakes
Reported
Yeah no.
I wanna believe he's sincere but let's be real, he probably would not be doing this months later if it didn't mean his career was on the line.
I really looked up to will Smith but the moment i saw that i had a lot of thoughts but my final thought was it was very unprofessional. At the end of the day we are all humans and make mistakes at some point of time but the basic difference is crore number of people are not looking up to us so we can easily hide it. I just wanted to hear from him. I hope they come to peace with it.
Chris needs to grow up, act like a man, and accept the apology. People make mistakes. Just like he did making fun of her chronic disease. What's done is done.
Just when we thought will Smith was more than just an actor...
It's hard to accept when you have made a mistake. Mistakes happen, apologize with better action. Well done 🙏
This is the perfect example of, if you're not ready to speak on something, then just don't. You're much better of just keeping to yourself or your closed ones to try to work through your stuff. It's all just a mess, on the one hand he says everything is foggy, that's why no apology came at the time of the acceptance speech, then he follows up later in the video by saying he's had time to replay the events while motioning beside his head as if he's recalling a memory. So which is it, selective memory? Then proceeds to contradict himself by saying "no part of him thinks that was the appropriate behavior or reaction," well, why does it still matter what he thinks? You already made a decision to act a certain way, whether it's impulse or not so your talk is cheap after the fact. Just get some help Will, no one is above help when they truly need it which has been apparent for quite some time now.
Bro puts out an apology for something four months ago for clout, when this should’ve been done privately or months prior
Still lying
It should be something be done in private…This video is completely unnecessary.
Well done my friend  Now it's time to move on.
Press X to doubt
Bruh are you for real
Apologize to Chris in person not the internet.
It's been 4 months. Will reading from script sounds like it was auto generated.   Too late, too fake.
Dang 67k dislikes
Sounds like he has a gun pointed at his head 😂
I forgot to unsubscribe! Bye Will!
What in the MKULTRA is this? Why is he talking so weird? Also, he needs to ditch that old hag he's with if he wants to find true happiness. She's the primary source of his unhappiness whether people wish to agree with it or not. Ditch her and find yourself a younger, non-westernised girl or just live the rest of your life being single. It's better than being with somebody who is toxic as hell and causes you to wild out over petty things.
I think the biggest question is do you feel that your actions deserve to be forgiven
I would love to see the dislikes for this lmao
I hope you don't carry the burden of shame. I am so deeply inspired by your humanity and your loving family. You are a treasure to us all, we learn, love, laugh and cry through you. Thank you for sharing, addressing this and being an example of grace even in this moment that surely stings for you. Also..... that FIREEEEEE SONG at the end of your audio book!! #feelinlikeWill ~ Philly stand up!
Will Smith is such a good actor. He can get in character even in time like this.  good good
Here's an idea Will, call Chris up, apologize to his face, and let him smack you around a bit.
When will let out that sigh I knew he was preparing for this moment to make the uilmate YouTuber apology video
Ok lol
At least he apologized on camera and not on tweet like some of these other celebrities who open their mouths and are force to apologize via Twitter.
That hat annoy me. Just make that circle round ffs.
You shouldn't of apologized imo, but it takes guts to do so nonetheless. Good on you mate
You and Amber Heard should make a movie together.
Waiting for all the perfect people to appear in the comment section to give there righteous judgments on him sigh…found them😒
Good apology Will. 💪
*it's easy to forgive but it's hard to forget*
bro did a youtuber apology 😭
I hope Observe examines this too.
KEEP MY WIFES NAME OUT YOUR F&@KING MOUTH 😹😂😂
We all make mistakes. Hope you can quickly bounce back and learn from it
When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.
Why be remorseful without shame? I feel like it's well deserved, but good luck.
Here’s my question: why did you do it? How?
goofy ahh apology video
Nope.
I forgive you.
What does CLM mean and why is there a lemon emoji after it?  Does it mean Celebrities lives matter or cuck lives matter? (according to urban dictionary)
Been the man, still the man! Keep leading fam!
Promoting your son's water bottle product placement, seriously man?
Hurting a person, later acting to forgive... Sorry smith you act too far from the line. You out from our movie list
Too late fool.
OK. I forgive you although it has nothing to do with me.   Now bring me Hancock 2
This is worst the James Charles apology video just being real liy James ily will
WILL YOU DA GOAT MAN FOR REAL!!!!!
💕💕💕
So happy to see that you are back Will. It has been a hell of a year for you but I want you to know that there are fans who supported you and fought for you throughout the whole incidence. It may not be the right action but it can be understood. I especially thought your book was phenomenal, I have learned so many lessons on relationships, feelings, disciplines, and courage, and these are such precious lessons that I otherwise would take years to learn. We've all grown and learned, now it's time to keep going. I already can't wait to see works you will create next, keep being brave Will!
Not that this situation has really affected me or probably anyone in these comments personally, but good job Will. My dad always says it takes a big man to apologize. If nothing else I and many others are proud of you.
It sucks getting older and seeing celebrities you grew up watching get into entanglements
UFC Style - fight it out Chris Vs. Will - jk we're all human and this was heartfelt. Welcome back Will.
hey will. i’m sorry for the weird comment, but do you have a niece in Pennsylvania right now? my friend goes to a school where there’s some girl who says she knows you. i don’t know.
I genuinely believe that Will Smith is a Good Man. I also believe that Good Men can struggle with things and lose perspective at times. What happened on that stage in front of millions of viewers was a absurdly dreadful thing to do, especially considering the circumstances, but, I strongly believe that, had Will Smith the ability to turn back time and correct his mistake, he would do so out of good intentions and not just to save his own ego. It's not up to anyone of us to forgive Will Smith, he must fix his flaws, make amends and then forgive himself once that weight has been adequately lifted. Life is complex, folks.
This just a classic youtuber apology video.
A mature, self-aware, emotionally intelligent and wise approach to healing, remorse and making a very real mistake. Respect, Will ❤️💪🏻
No need for Apology
Gotta let him get his lick back
This guy is 50, he should have had the maturity and self control to not do what he did.  That being said, I don’t think he’s a bad person, or that he deserves to lose everything over this, he definitely deserved the backlash though. I do hope he recovers from this eventually, otherwise he’s gonna be on a watch mojo list with Michael Richards and sinead O’Connor.
Textbook YouTube apology Will I’m sure you won’t be memed for this👍
will the only person i know who wears a hat with a W on it ina videos full of Ls
I think the only way to fix this... is to actually have Chris on this video. This video has no real meaning.
Stop making these public!  It seems like a grab for attention.  Do this mess privately and let Chris set the record straight.  You, Mr. Smith, should not have the upper hand here.
Will screwed up, we all F up, some WAY worse than Will, time to move on.
Why didn’t you apologize when this happened? If you meant it you would have said sorry immediately..
Not an easy thing to come out and say. Not playing it down, you humiliated Chris infront of the whole world he did well in light of the situation on hand. I'm sure you have blamed yourself harshly for all of this. Who am I to judge you on any actions, I have done wrong myself but I didn't have the world humiliate me after. We are human we make mistakes. I believe GOD is the only one to judge and I believe in having mercy/forgiveness to your fellow human being if in return you seek it also from GOD.I am a big fan of yours you have brought much laughter to humans around the world. I don't expect to earn anything from you as you did me no wrong.
He doesn't actually care about the situation, he's just making this video because he's losing a ton of money due to his actions
What if this boy worked out for the last three months and then challenged Chris to a Jake Paul boxing match 😂
Alot of people have been in a bad position. Your millions of dollars kinda give you a free pass, obviously.
missing a hoodie and messy hair to make this a true youtuber apology
i think that he is sincere
HEY  Will  you and everyone here  is human   We all at one time o point on our lives make BIG  a mistake THAT affect us for our entire life and is ok.  I think C R will sooner realize that something was not right with you to do this and soon you will soon be back to normal
NO APOLOGIES NEEDED KING 🍋CLM ✊
U've *NVR disappointed me; It DEFINITELY wuzn't the rite thing 2⃣ do, But the important thing Iz, 2⃣ learn,&2⃣ B,&do Ure Best,&I feel Ur truly trying 2⃣ make Amends... 🤗🤍🙏🏽💭💯
I’m glad he didn’t do the “YouTuber apology cry” and it’s good that he finally did a public apology, but I’m still not Buying it. Idk.
Just because he is a celebrity, doesn’t mean he is any less of a human then we all are. We all f up at some point in our lives, it’s just what humans do.. none of us are perfect & Will most definitely isn’t either. Did he f up? 100%, should he be held accountable for that? 100% he should. But it’s time we all just move tf on from it, what’s done is done & what’s said has been said.. it’s time for Chris & Will to sort things out between themselves, at the end of the day.. it should have stayed between themselves.
What he needs to do is show how he is changing --. he needs to prove himself.
Your excuse was your brain was fuzzy?
I feel like it’d be more relatable if he just came out and said, “Look y’all, I fucked up. I fucked up and nothing I can say or do is going to take away how bad I fucked that up. I know I’m gonna take the L for awhile, I get it. It is what it is. My bad.”
Yeah, I don’t see an apology. I see regret, but no remorse
I genuinely hope Chris forgives him, and I genuinely hope this was the last we see of Will's as an actor. Fake apology... smh
Excellent performance... I almost cried.
Man, this is going to bring some proper monetization results. Hope you share that with those in need.
That's friendly fire, black on black crime
Nice acting 🎭 still a good actor.
In short, “I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm simply here to apologize”.
He wants hype
It will take time, but genuine reparations always do, We supported you through the good, and are here for you while you work through this.
Your actions were terrifyingly deliberate and malicious.  The only path to redemption is through Chris and this video is NOT a good start.
i hope yall can get on good terms again but the apology should really be focused on him and his family
Will I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Do the world a favor and leave it.
BOOOOOOOOO
Apology not accepted.
🙄 this dude is on that ish kanye is on.
If you are truly sorry give up your award and excuse yourself from future attendance at the awards.
Didn’t he already write an apology and post it on Instagram?? Hmmm in my opinion he’s just trying not be canceled and get his movie deals back on the table since some were put on hold.
Best YouTube apology video
LAMONTING
Eggplant 🍆
We are human! We make mistakes! We love you Will❤️
Didnt it happen so long ago?
It’s alright will I’ve had anger problems too that developed over the few years of being isolated and had another fit of rage last night towards my family I’m pretty disgusted w my self
PROUD TO SAY WE"RE IN THIS TOGETHER 🍋✊ CLM
Nice try, Will! You at least did a good job with the words you spoke here... nice work,. Personally I still love you as an actor, as I always have, but I still know what you did wrong was wrong, as I have known since I was a kid.
What’s with these “CLM” comments?
William Smitherines vs Christopherson Rockafeller
I’m sorry… all answers stil fill disingenuous.
L apology
Imagine if dislikes were still visible
Views = YouTube money
You're human. We love you. Your work is very estimated in Brazil
Step by step?
Get a divorce, fix your mommy issues, work on becoming a man and start avoiding toxic women.
Bro is reading a script
it's not that serious bro
Уилл, на церемонии ты поступил правильно. Шутки про больного человека омерзительны. Ты поступил как мужчина, заступившись за свою жену.
I have decided that (among other things) you are just very, very, very, bad at apologies.  Even this terrible attempt at one.  It is OK to be ashamed of yourself every so often (and you SHOULD BE) and if you acted like a piece of s**t (which IMHO you did), then it is OK, and maybe even good, to feel like one (at least for a while) as it shows you have a conscious.  You should have OWNED feeling ashamed and like a piece of s**t because ANYONE PROBABY WOULD FEEL THAT WAY and it is NATURAL to feel that way (considering).  Instead, you did the opposite.  Also, I did not hear a SINGLE WORD about how you effected Serena Williams, her family, and the movie's legacy.  In general, this (and your first few attempt at an apology) all seem to come from a place of "I want to make Will Smith feel good" when you should only be concerned about others.  At this point, IMHO talking about how you are working on yourself is ASSUMED so you should just stop talking about yourself and your family and 100% focus on people outside of your family.  In general, >>EVEN NOW << for some reason, you fail to be (or at least come off as) HUMBLE... and that is one of the major things that you need most in order to perform a PROPER & SINCERE apology.  U need to eat a GIANT humble pie if you ever try to apologize to anyone again.
Praying for you Will and Chris that healing will come on both sides 🙏🏽 and when the time is right will can make it right!
Why are you even smiling first of all
Wait, what? What happened?
"I apologize to you" lmao, cant even say sorry.
Good to see you back, man
Don’t mention anybody else except chris.
Sadly there’s echos of the apology letters I’ve read by criminals, where they still can’t stand in the full glare of what they’ve done.  There’s a dancing around and away from that full glare.
To the people that call this "just damage control" I want to ask at what point will ut ever not be damage control. It seems like no matter how different the video is it gets the exact same response every time. You don't have to forgive anyone, that's your choice at the end of the day but it makes me sad that every single person who apologizes for something is just "saving themselves" in people's eyes. I feel people at least deserve to have their apologies taken seriously and listened ti even if it's not accepted.  If I'm ignorant and wrong then you can explain how and I'll accept that.
Lmao, he never states - " I am sorry Chris".
I love ya, man. We are ALL human. We ALL make mistakes. Some mistakes bigger than others. Hopefully eventually, Chris will sit with you and talk it out. I still love and respect you as a person. Thank you for taking the time to make this apology the best you can make it. Very well said. Much love
Boooooo
No more apologies needed. You did what you did, some of us were with you and some of us were against you. I hope you and Chris make amends, but if not, well you said what you had to say. I STILL SUPPORT YOU WILL!
PR move
I feel this was truly genuine and thoughtful. He owned up to his mistake and openly shared his insecurities about this with the world. I still love Will Smith, watched him everyday growing up and will always watch his movies. I hope he can continue to work on himself and move past this. ♥️✌️
u beat wiomen fd
bruh it’s been months who cares at this point
Whateva..
Should have just let everyone know Chris didn't want to talk and this video was how you deliver an apology.  Then apologize and leave it.  This is too many words and too scripted.
eh
Bro leave her…
Why does every Youtube apology have the same cadence? It's like the person apologizing inserts a period after every word.  "I've. Reached. Out. To. Chris." Anyways, we are not entitled to an apology. You didn't hurt me in any way. You are human, You make the same mistakes us unfamous people do. It's just that you did it in Hollywood if front of a room with high net worth, and in front of a camera broadcasting your mistake around the world. Kind of sad when you think about it. Just work on you Will, the rest will fall in place. Time heals most things. Bless you all
Will Smith is going to have to  spending years apologizing to for acting like a caveman, before I pay to see another film with his name on it in any capacity again.
So scripted and he only answers two questions- face palm
Evil demons got him good. Rebuke Satan not will. Poor bastard 🙏
FYI: Like to dislike is 71k to 64k
Wow it's been a while since we've had a YouTuber apology video! Same as the other ones 😂.
I’ll never respect or see Will smith the same. I’ll never support anything Will Smith has a hand in.
Goofy ahh apology video. We need a boxing match NOW LMAO
Ummm it’s been way to long to apologize ….. so I guess he has to do it in his terms . Lame . Also . Let’s not give this guy any more attention …. Literally no one cares .
i would’ve doubled down and called out chris to a boxing match
🤡
I forgive you will.
People in the comments saying we forgive you Will when this is one of the most scripted and unapologetic apology videos out on YouTube
0:11 eeww bro that’s nasty
👋🏽 forever
I wonder what like to dislike ratio look like.
Ratio
These comments are so dumb. No apology will make up for what will smith did. That was just completely uncalled for and no one can fix what he did. The fact it took him this long to do this vid should tell you that.
Will smith need to repent and get right with god
This is a great learning experience being unpacked before our eyes. Its unfortunate that it happened on such a huge public platform. But i kind of knew will smith would not disappoint in comprehensively deconstructing the events leading up to the regrettable act and  dealing with the  repercussions there after.  The lesson helps us all.  Thank you. I wish you all healing. 😊
I thought Will Smith was recording his first "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" album during those few months of silence.
No
Oh Will, don’t you know BLACK LIVES MATTER?!    #cancelwillsmith
You are  petty and pathetic. Took you long enough to apologize, at this point it’s irrelevant and insincere.
Cringe
Man everyone deserve a second 3d or 4th chance.  What if God didn’t forgive us for what we do or did, So Big ups for Will for apologizing.
Bruh. Not going to lie. This is too late. You have to just sit down for a while like Mel Gibson did.
Said sorry to everyone but Chris ☠️
Tom Segura said everything I would like to say
Disgraceful
Hey @Will Smith, only time will tell about that episode. Many questions unanswered, but if you really regret and go back to work, good work on everything, then everything will be allright. Real fans are waiting for you. A long way ahead for you, my bro.
I'm sorry but it's too late to say sorry this late, you're only saying sorry now because what you did is now effecting your wallets/money.
Great sigh at the beginning, but no dog. 3/10 apology, not believable.
I don’t accept it. Because you don’t have to ask for the forgiveness. You are totally right at the very beginning and every aspect. They deserved to get hurt.
Wow. That was awful. Nice product placement, though. The world is full of narcissism and you're one of its top promoters. Funny how it's always the people who preach "love", "acceptance", "equality" and "light"who are the biggest hypocrites. I would know, I used to be one of them. Words mean nothing, actions are everything.
Yotuber Apology Checklist:  1. Start video by sitting down and letting out a huge gasp 2. Say sorry to everyone except the person who needs to hear it 3. Make up excuses  4. Let everyone know this has made you a better person
I support you during this process. Fully.
I'm using a browser extension to return the youtube dislikes and this video has 64k dislikes 😂
71k likes 10k dislikes
I'll give the video a like.
I still see him as a mean person, not accepting this apology
this sucks, u didn't say "im sorry chris"
I can't believe that " I made a choice on my own". No bruh. That woman's been digging in his skin for years. It's not easy having someone like that. They aren't worth it. Best move there it to get rid of her. She even through the blame back at you for views and likes. Nah man. You know better.
Bro took 3-4 months to apologize
This is my fav. Actor growing up. I lost so much respect of him doing this. THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO.
it's been a min yes I hope you guys pitch stuff up, the world saw it and the world know understand it. It takes a lot in a black man to apologize yes and I'm glad you did it now instead of a year later. I hope Christ sees this soon.
just from the amount of likes i can tell will got ratio'd
Why does this video exist? Just so Smith can try to save his image, seem like a good guy to impressionable fans. He should apologize in person, not do a public announcement
It takes so much humility Will Smith to go back on YouTube and apologize when you were wrong I don’t have to prophesy but God is going to honor you for that my advice to you is to listen to Dr Jamal Bryant sermon on Keep My Wife’s Name Out of your mouth just a message to encourage you we all make mistakes see Romans 3:23. Stay strong Will Smith praying 🙏 for you More Grace to your life.
Why does he keep looking down? It looks like he is reading a transcript
This is pathetic
Actually it's been almost 5 months
Will I know you'll never read this, and I appreciaite that you seem to know that you're wrong.   And you're saying mostly the right things. And I get that being a celeb subjects you to unpleasant scrutiny and the risk of being somebody's punchline.  But take this from someone who as a 12 year old got pummeled by an adult stranger who was as unhinged and disproportionate as you were that night: this ain't going away.  Chris will have to deal with it forever, and his fans will now expect him to talk about it in his act.  Everyone who saw it will probably have it on their mind when they look at you, forever.  Anyone who ever had something like that happen to them will be reminded of their experience every time they see you on the screen. You'll just have to deal with all of that, from now on.  Be humble.  Respect the sh-- you took on that event and all those people that night.  That's your cross to bear now.
"I apologize to you. My behavior was unacceptable and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk."    Insincere, didn't express regret or acknowledge what he actually did wrong, didn't offer explanation for the behavior, no contrition of the action itself, narcissist assuming that its now in Chris' hands to respond.  He reached out privately, and Chris as entitled, didn't respond. By reaching out publicly when Chris had chosen not to respond, he's turned it into a PR event, for his benefit alone.  "Fogged out at that point" seems to mean he thought he was right at that point, that the world would see him as the white knight and Chris a villain. Now, 4 months later, he's trying to change perception, then own the narrative.
Guardian news video of will Smith is 2:40 minutes long
He's either genuine or just a really good actor.
Acting.
if i could laugh react i would. get a divorce
... give back the award.  this one's tarnished. Work hard and you will get another one ... you are that talented. You will get another one.
I appreciate that he took the time to reflect before making a knee jerk reaction healing tour. Healing takes time. I am here for the journey and look forward tot he reconciliation of good friends.
Clown behavior 🤡
My mans be reading from an audio prompter
I couldn’t care less if he made an apology video now, it has been 1/3 of the year, I forgot he even did that for all of this summer, he should of made this 4 months earlier, not now, it’s like me breaking a plate, and then apologizing a year later, like people have already forgiven you, why make an apology now
Trying to be remorseful without shame is a really hard thing to do for yourself and others. I’m happy he made this video
Top 10 YouTube Apologies of All Time
Something in my gut tells me that you Nitpicked those questions during the pre-production.
Lebron has "The Decision"  Will Smith "It's been a minute"
🤡
what do you mean he is not ready to talk???
I just wanted to hear him say sorry to those other nominees. Like those from the deaf/disabled community who had historic wins overshadowed by will smith
We are here for you 🍋✊CLM
Chris be like NOPE
Man, this is really not necessary. Just apologize sincerely to Chris, you didn't even do it in this video. You just had to say something like: "Chris, I'm sorry". But you simply didn't.
I feel like no apology is needed. The only reason people are mad is because they dont understand actions and consequences. Never explain yourself.
Bro. You're embarassing.
He’s not sorry he’s pulling the same ol YouTube apologize tropes we seen from jake Paul and alike, don’t fall for this, he’s just trying to save whatever face he’s got left because it’s not our place to accept it it’s Chris choice but will make this a big song and dance to just block more hate his way, it’s sad when someone can’t man up face to face with someone he’s openly hurt and use some dignity instead of this random video months after it would have be somewhat effective.
Definitly much better than the Travis Scott apology
Its not that deep really..
Adjust
Will,You are a beautiful soul.Dont worry or bother about the voices that judge you without knowing your part of story,We all have emotional triggers at some point.your apology reached heaven so forget about Earth and chill more!🌷
Didn't Jaden say that night, "That's how we roll?" That's your child.  Come on man.  If you felt it you would have been so ashamed your child would have felt the shame.   Nope.  We got, "That's how we roll"
Why didnt you adress this sooner? This feels like you finally realized how much you fucked up and are trying to save your career. This feels disingenuous and like you are only doing it to keep your reputation. I don't believe you are truly sorry.
Friendly reminder to add "Disklike counter" to your browser so you can see the insane amount of dislikes on this video and then leave one yourself
Will I hear you man, everything is going to be just fine God has a path for us. So Hod has things for us to go through and learn and I’m telling you from experience we all can learn from what God puts in our path. Everything will be fine. Believe me!
it's been a minute but he's still number 1 on trending
Me this, me that, I, I.. narcissism man.. All about you and your feelings..  Thats your problem.
too late, the damage is done
pretty mid apology
Nope too late hopefully the internet keeps a negative opinion on you
I can’t remove from my memory the look of shock and embarrassment on  Chris Rocks face. Unforgivable Will.
Let's be honest he may be apologizing but damn he's gonna make money of this video.
Too little, too late.  I looked up to you for years, but you ruined your own legacy!  You will always be known for this over anything else.  It’s unfair that “elites” can break the law on television and get away with it.  You deserve severe punishment.
well he owned up to his mistake, he made good apology, not shifting blame or making up excuses - what else are you guys expecting? We are all do dumb things sometimes, and the flawless characters that we often see in movies isn't necessarily representative of an human actor behind it. I've never been a Will Smith fan - I am completely neutral on this person, but I do kinda feel bad for him being in the spotlight on 24/7 and every his mistake is amplified and has 100s of articles written about.
You're amazing, you reacted, you are human man. You're my favorite person ever and could never let me down.
lmfao, its a dead end, no apology can fix the shame chris went through on that stage
Bettter late than never I guess
FAKE Apology. BUT great actor!
It’s rewind time!
You still good in my book. Everyone makes mistakes 🤷🏿‍♀️
♥️
If it isn’t my favorite fortnite streamer, Will Smith!    It’s rewind time!!
What you did is so disrespectful and can't be accepted cause like it's an award show  You could do it in the back stage at least if you were that angry  I donnu but second chance is something that anyone deserves  That's what I think Well the thing that you're a human being a you do mistakes that counts for some things  Other things in life can't be called a mistake cause they're so important that we just can't say that I'm a human and I do mistakes  Anyways hope you get another chance cause all humans deserve it
"umm" "umm" never seen him deliver lines so poorly 😂
dam will smith upgraded to average youtuber
This feels so generic, not in the usual free flow type of talking he usually does. Something's off...
Everyone falls bro ...it's what you do now ... it will get better I promise you
Whatever your going through Will. You need some DEEEP HEALLINGG
It's okay guys. The devil made him do it
This guy so lucky YouTube removed the dislike button
Thanks for your efforts Will , Time has a way of forgiveness from two parties, until then ✌️
Thanks for your efforts Will , Time has a way of forgiveness from two parties, until then ✌️
You're in a dark place right now. You will see the light again; things will be different in a better way. Good luck !
At least he is owning up to his mistake
I believe the last bit. But honestly, just be honest with yourself and do what you need to do bruh. You SHOULD feel ashamed. You ARE NOT a piece of s**t. You ARE human and you deserve the best. You've worked hard to get where you are, but something is unbalancing you. We love you bruh but you need to start loving yourself again. NOT your ego or the persona you've cultivated. You.
Wtf is CLM and are those bots that are writing this
nice hat
It takes a lot of courage to be able to take the kind of heat that you did Will. Even if you made a poor decision in an emotionally charged moment, we all deserve forgiveness for our faults and mistakes. Managing our emotions is something I think we all can learn to do better. Making this apology video was very commendable and your genuine feelings of remorse are clearly evident. This won't take you down, brother 🙏❤✌
#clm
Cuando te pones a leer en vez de exponer
the fresh prince reboot looks weird
We make mistakes Will, what I respect more is that you’re owning up to it. That’s it. We work on ourselves everyday, we disappoint  people more often that we think but the great thing is, we pick up the pieces and own up. Everyone could see that is was a spare of the moment decision and you regret it. You’re only human, you have emotions and sometimes we miss to control our emotions. I can see you’re not well… take time and work on yourself, forgive yourself first before anything ❤️
why now its been like a month
This whole Hollywood culture of putting everything out there feels so rehearsed and managed. They took 4 months for them to plan how WS would address this without it backfiring, when his real concern should be privately getting in touch with CR (and continuing to try) without worrying about his image.
Okay will, we forgive you. You human. Don't stress to much. Your awesome. We all make mistakes. But let it shape you and you will be better from it. Glad to see you going forward and making changes to yourself.
Big Will, been a fan for most of your career (from buying your CDs to watch every movie) and held you as a great person to be inspired by during my childhood.   I was shocked when it happen because it was so not you to do something like that, but I also appreciate you took time for yourself before making an statement like this and having the character to apologise and answer some of the questions is really noble and shows that you are indeed a good human being.   I'm sure Chris will also understand and might forgive you for it. Sad to see your beautiful history be stained by this. Hope you and Chris can overcome this episode in the future so both of you can have a closure.
Anyway stream Renaissance 🐝
I didn't care
Hi world data
Caveman behavior.
I don’t think I met anyone who’s seen king Richard …who voted for him to win in the first place ?
❤️ 🤗
Nah I don't believe any of this 🤣 more like you spend 3 months on vacation you lost me as a fan and I know in the grand scheme of things that may seem small but trust me when I say I am not the only one who thinks this way
It takes courage to show humility because the ultimate view is maturity.  I respect him for even taking the time out to transform himself and present once again the transformation to the world not everyone gets this opportunity.  Blessings to you Will Smith💎
I dont care
The people who still hate him act as if they are saints and had never been  made mistakes.
Still remembered to have the Just Water container in full view during this “apology”.
That ratio tho 😬
Everyone commenting their opinions like this has anything to do with them. Nobody actually cares right? 🥶
That sigh at the beginning was a wonderful start. Next time, though, try to keep out the editing. Usually, YouTubers try to keep their bad apologies unedited.
I will end myself if I see another clm comment on this video
Loved the deep sigh at the start - makes you appear genuine
Will 🙏🏼
We gotta recognize that this is the HUMAN experience. Will Smith is NOT YOUR SAVIOR. He is imperfect and makes mistakes, and honestly didn’t NEED to apologize, him being able to apologize is showing that he is a good one.
I have always admired you! It’s sad that you still haven’t left that woman. Until you do… you will still have these issues. For you and your health, I wish you do soon. You deserve much better
i, for one, do not forgive you, Will.
Phony
Love, respect, and light, Will. ❤️🙏
Very proud of you for speaking because many of us have done less and refuse to take responsibility for anything.  You made a powerful statement regarding the need not to let anyone down.  I hope you go back and heal "Lil" Will because I remember you saying you let your mom down when your father was beating her.   Until you heal the little boy in you, he will continue to control your life.   I support and understand what unresolved trauma can do.  Peace and blessings to you.
Damn he left the comments on
For real took notes from every YouTuber apology video ever.
Man my respect for this man has fallen incredibly.
My dearest Will. I think this happened for a reason,  we love you and all this hurt us. But, all of us as you, are humans and we can make mistakes too and the example of how you overcome to it, it is how we will learn from you to overcome ours. I'm so sorry this happened but let's take the positive from this and expect from the great Chris to understand and have greatness and forgive the hurt that will lead an example of humility and good on this hurted world.
ITS A TRAP
I don't understand what you and Chris have to talk about. Without judgment, I recommend that you let this go. Luckily you weren't arrested, Chris did not sue, and the injury was not worse. Good to know that you have spent time on reflection. What you will DO now and in the future will define you.
I have been such a big fan of yours since I was a little kid. That night you lost me for life sir.
I missed you.still my hero
Right actions in the future are the best apologies for bad actions in the past.
Feeling remorseful without feeling shame. Ugh, so resonate! This is a bigger, collective conversation really. We can own up to our shadows without pulling ourselves down
Oh poor little Will Smith, it's okay guys he's sorry 🤣
Took bro 4 months to apologize for something he should’ve said during the moment
Sorry, but I do not believe your apology!  This must be about your movie coming out..😒
Can’t believe I am saying this but , James Charles and Will Smith have a lot in common.
Will, all we are humans, and we make and made mistakes, it’s time to move on, but I think if it’s possible try to talk directly with the guy and say directly to him your apologize I hope you have the opportunity to do it! Wish the best for you and for all …
This will got down as one of the most legendary youtube apology videos ever.
This strategy of apologize can also be use to those political idol that do bad thing.
Will, I don’t think you got enough attention out of this apology. I would have appreciated more fake self-deprivation in the name of popularity.
Took him 5 months
KEEP MY WIFES NAME
Will. will. will. I think you should have done a quick video. No rehearsing. No talking at 1/2 speed. All truth. Straight from the heart.  "Look guys. I messed up. When you have millions and are super famous, your head blows up. You think you da man and can do anything you want. But once I got back to my seat. I knew I messed up big time and there was no going back. But now I realize the power of social/media justice. It cannot be denied despite how many millions you have. So please. I need to be forgiven so that I can start making movies and millions again.  Simple. Something we all can understand. Selfish. But all Truth. If I heard that from you. I would definitely give you the green light for another movie.
Real eyes realise real lies
lol , so pathetic. Felt so plastic. not realistic.
My only problem with this apology is not even about whether Will is genuine or not. It’s the right thing to do really but why in the good heavens is he going to profit off of it?? How many views is it right now? Tens of millions? What’s youtube’s rate per view in USA? Or does A celebrity not have a special per view rate?
Beta
Youtuber apology bingo anyone?
Hope he uses the money he is making on his channel with this video to pay Chris.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this is so late, it's not genuine. He never truly says "I'm Sorry" to Chris. he says I apologize, but its not the same. also, this should have been handled privately, doing it publicly further shows how this is BS.
Chris deserved it man idk why youre apologizing
Real problem is in his household
Bro pulled out 3 cameras for tha apology video 💀
You are just a lovely HuMan! Good !
am i the only person who felt he sounded like he was reading from a teleprompter?
Get help for real. Sad to see will like this.
What new movies coming out?  What executive told him he had to do this because it's not simply going away while he disappeared in Dubai or wherever he hid
Why would you apologise it was months ago.
Sending you so much love and strength Will. Thank you for all the happiness you continue to bring to my family and this world.
muy bien
nice
Its aight will
Yup... I remember the word "tarnished" .... I use it so often when I say sorry. 😅😅😅
What about bel air????? (this is before me watching)
He's a sap!
Chris rocks making a lot of cash thanks to will
Lmao the situation was all just good entertainment
Hey man, if Chris is cool with you, we’re cool w/ you. Live and learn for sure. You’re good in my book
This should’ve been a LOT longer Will..
Would you be remorseful if everyone had been on YOUR side?
That was weird.
Gostei da sua atitude will Smith, eu faria o mesmo!ele mereceu!salvador Bahia! Um beijo no seu coração, que Deus abençoe VC sempre!
3 months break for this? Hard MEH
I resubscribed
The world was more outragesd with Will then those pedos Hollywood revealed 🤣🤣
You messing up Beyonce album release with this BS
"He who is without sin cast the first stone"
My man Will has been a damn near perfect role model for 35 years. That should not be thrown away because of one mistake. I'm still rocking with the Fresh Prince.
Get rid of that woman who doesn't care for you and only takes advantage of you. She is a terrible person and is manipulating you.
Wills Career is suffering alot more than his conscience.  4 months to be sorry ! Another top grade fake youtuber apology!
Dude leave this alone already
looks like a hostage video
He's pulling the Hancock apology
No thanks.
"Its been a minute" No, its been 4 monthts
Hey everyone he felt like he had to make this video because after 4 months of backlash plus this literally ruining his career that can take a toll on someone you might have gotten over it you only think it's fake but I can tell you now it's not so y'all need to get over yourself and just forgive the man he's doing what he can do
Will, meu parceiro, fica em paz, fica bem, Brasil te ama.
Lol damn everyone in these comments is squeaky clean huh? Not even one your friends ever fucked up🥴🤔 damn where all these angels at?!?
Umm, yeah. Not buying it. We'll likely never meet, and I doubt you ever even see my comment, but nothing about this feels sincere. I hope Im wrong in saying this, but if you REALLY cared why would you choose a monetized platform to apologize (drive views to get paid for an "apology")? At one time I considered you one of the greatest in Hollywood, but damn how far you have fallen. I truly hope you fund healing and are able to move on but I'm done being a supporter.
Who believes this crap
but like, obviosuly there is a part of him that thinks thats the way to handle it cuz... thats what he did lmao.
L
He’s a good actor
Will you do not need to apologize! He 1000% deserved it.
Why isn’t this video titled, “I’m sorry Chris,” and instead “It’s been a minute…”
Cool statent and apology. Until ya leave that 'person' bringing you down.. 😮‍💨 all these just looks like a PR stunt.
Homie it's been 4 months we don't care
Just stop. You can't be a bad boy and apologize twice
Honestly, Will needs to release a rap album as soon as possible....
Te amamos Smith, todos somos seres humanos y a veces nos dejamos llevar por el impulso o creer que hacemos lo correcto, es de humanos cometer errores y saber pedir perdón te queremos✊🏽
ask him to play fortnite with you ong
#freewillsmith !! Will smith did wrong , but we all have. Look around you, all of us born sinners.
God bless and I’ll be praying for you and all of us
Sounds like he's reading off a script
I BELIEVE YOU WILL, you made a mistake and you are owning up to it. You made a mistake, we all do. Look forward to seeing you fulfill your acting career. CARPE DIEM
Lmao dude has his book attached to this video this is a sad attempt to sell more copies of his boring book..
To me, saying "I apologize" is not the same as saying "I'm sorry".  It's not semantics, you need to say the words.  He said " I'm sorry" to his family members, but not to Chris and his family.
Why is man's dressing like Carlton
Such a good acting 🎭
Team Chris. This apology bs.
It’s so sad to see people with millions of dollars upset.
Man I wish we could see the dislikes on this video!
Your honesty is refreshing, Will
I just hope that the Academy is watching this.
Love
i think u could bro no need
This man should consider acting! Amazing!
So I had to look up CLM and I found: CLM: Construction Loan Manager: CLM: Compact Lisp Machine: CLM: Communications Link Monitor: CLM: Corporate Logical Model (Sprint) CLM: Centre des Langues et du Multimédia (French: Center for Languages and Multimedia; Blaise Pascal University) CLM: Case Line Manager: CLM: Coated Launch Motor (solid rocket motor design). Give a nod if Im getting close.....:
Im confused, whats emoney and clm
You need to go to jail. Anyone of us would have. You’re not above the law.
Toxic
The only thing is is that it's taken 4 months to say this, which makes it feel less genuine because it should've happened sooner but you've left that image from 4 months to fester in peoples minds even if I want to believe Will its hard
If you do a really charismatic “hooooyaaaaah!” We’ll forgive you
we wont watch ur next movie
I never comment on YouTube stuff but there’s a first time for everything I guess lol. This phrase just comes too strongly to mind: “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.” Nobody should be too good for or above forgiving a fellow “sinner” aka human. Especially one who sincerely asks for that forgiveness with what seems to be genuine intent and commitment to doing the work to be better. No one should take pleasure in another’s feelings of shame or be merciless in “punishing” that person.. cancelling everything ELSE about them that is great. No one can or should be defined by a single action because we wouldn’t want that to be the rule if the tables were to be turned around on our own selves, right? No one can PROVE that this apology isn’t truly heartfelt and sincere so we’re left to hope and believe that it is. That’s something called “benefit of the doubt” if anyone remembers what that is in this world today. What value is there in incriminating a regretful and remorseful person for life and branding them as unworthy of redemption? We can’t abandon people for being imperfect (especially when they’re taking at least what seems to be sincere steps to right their wrongs). Ask yourself “what makes YOU qualified to offer or withhold forgiveness?” Let’s get off our high horses and bring back understanding, empathy, and a belief that people can learn from their mistakes and grow to be better. And I say this with continued disappointment in this whole thing having happened and so much sadness/empathy for Chris.
You just understood when you lost acting jobs lol
Are you sorry to us? Or are you sorry to Chris?
Will Smith, this is really simple. An apology video is exactly that, an apology. All you had to do was start off with, “hey everyone. I Fd up, but you all already know that.” And then unpack the stuff
Es de humanos el cometer errores y de héroes el pedir perdon y aceptar la disciplina.  ¡Te queremos campeón!
Wow its will smith!
You're only human and anyone that sees you as more than that is a fool. You make mistakes just like everyone else in this world. You don't owe anyone anything nor do you owe us an apology. I felt like that was cool of you to do so . Knowing that you're a star and you have eyes on you ,you felt the need to publicly do so.Despite that it's none of our business. Keep being awesome!
When Will Smith makes an apology video, you know it's genuine and he really accepts his mistake.
L apology. I’ve heard it already, all these YouTube apologies are the same man
That was the MOST scripted “apology “ I’ve ever heard lmfao.
The problem with this apology it’s too late. You should’ve apologized a long time ago in my opinion but hey it is what it is.
Not my bussiness in my opinion it's between him and Chris
this just shows how good an actor Will Smith is, he deserves another award on this one 😀
L
CLM ✊🍋
Thanks*
He makes some good points, but unfortunetly he doesn't dramatically sigh quite loud enough at the beginning for me to consider this to be a good apology video.
@will smith Thanks for your efforts to make things right.
I am proud of my man
Você é um ser humano como qualquer um. Não se cobre tanto. Os humanos normalmente fazem cagadas mesmo. Relaxa.
nah this man gonna get clowned on now
Wait....did he actually apologize to Chris in this video? He literally did to everyone else.  Even his family
On the fade out, i couldnt tell if he was having an emotional moment or was bursting into a smirk?
pewds is gonna have a good time with this one
💀
Lmaoo made sure to put his boxed water brand right next to him cause he knew how much publicity this video would receive 🤣😂
Bro talkin like he veteran in the war, “I just fogged out” u was accepting an award bro 😂
Bruh 59k dislikes
What is CLM? And why are people using lemon emojis next to it? Can someone explain please.
😄😄😄😄😄 Thing is, there’s a lot of comments here saying “we forgive you will” but to be honest it isn’t for us to forgive him. It’s up to Chris. He can only make that call.
WoW Please somebody tell me what CLM means is it “chis loves me” or “Chris likes meat” like dafuq
Not enough people are going to be able to forgive him for him to be hireable as an actor for the next 5-10 years. The best thing he could do is say don't hire me, hire my kids.
This is why we need the dislike count back lol
That was the most unsincere apology to chris ever.  "I apologoize to you chris" loooool 😂😂😂😂😂😂you didnt even say sorry
XAXAXAXAXAXAXAXA
Immediately no
Yada-yada, everyone still loves Will Smith
hell naw bruh
Daaaaaahhh
Todays fun fact: Every year China uses 45 Billion chopsticks.
All I see and is a man talking. I could tell there's no sincerity... Sounds like there's an agenda behind this weird apology
This is truly not a real apology. There is no emotion behind the words, the word choice is obviously well thought out maybe even scripted/memorized. Saying “I apologize” is different than “I am sorry” One is a neutral non emotional “connection” while the other shows emotion and genuine concern. This is not real or genuine, it’s a publicity stunt to clean his record for all movie deals/ marketing reasons. Another thing is when you apologize for something you did to somebody, that should be private! Apologizing one on one to somebody in a conversation only you and the other person knows is different than apologizing to the general public. Again it changes the emotional aspect as a “secret” apologize is genuine while a public one is viewed as necessary to repair your self image
May the Lord Jesus Christ & those you hurt forgive you May God Heal your brokenness so you can be saved healed and whole for your family and God's Glory God bless you Will this too shall pass❣️🕊️🙏🏾🕯️
Hopefully Chris sees this
No thank you
Still disappointed, mainly because you promoted getting older and wiser and better but what you did took effort. That wasn't just heat of the moment, you took a nice long walk and thought about what you were doing.  Just disappointing to see someone you look up to and followed intentionally hurt someone.
I’m still and always will be a fan. Will is human and he made a very bad mistake. Continue to work on you Will much love!!❤️
I never thought will smith would actually do an apology video
Keep your head up Will!! Things will be ok. Just heal.
I hate all wills movies even the bad boys reggie scene which was funny as hell now its just anger.
King lost his crown 👑,  now he's crying in his pourage.  Naw man. Bullies be bullies and Idols fall. He had his time in the sun!
you are human. period point blank. and as a human we all make mistakes some you can recover from some you cannot. but shame is not something that should equate not being able to heal.  I hope that you and Chris have a chance to talk and heal . but i know that is up to Chris it was his humiliation in front of the world that was broadcast out.  but live in the time as a human and know your role and be willing to accept Chris' place in this as it is his time to heal and feel the world out right now. He ultimately has to decide if there is a place in his world for you or not.
How many takes did this take? [+]
mf really apologized on youtube of all places  lmao
the world is sick,  love is the cure funny isn't it forget and forgive I guess
It's pretty sad people think this could actually be genuine and not another agent stoked clout grab.
Damn Will. I can't hate on that man. But mayne what are you doing?
Why have different camera angles and so much editing? Really undermines the authenticity when its been made for production value and not its content. Also apologising to people outside your family but saying sorry to members of your own family is pretty transparent.
And now buy my book so i can tell you everything about it!nice promo will
“Chris’ family, I’m soooo sorry 😭” “Chris, I apologise buddy 😌”
I legitimately think he did nothing wrong. Everyone needs to chill and move on.
The people who loved and supported Will before this will continue to do so. The people who were already not fans of his will continue to pretend that they were before this incident. It’s funny how people can dislike someone and yet at the same time always want to be  wherever that person is literally.
We will not be silenced! #CLM
I forgive will, he may have some anger down there but he is still a good guy. Hes alright in my book.
bro was holding back a smile 💀
I dont think its right what you did but i grew up watching you in so many movies and tv, i'll always be a fan.
Justice for Chris
Box water sponsored apology? 😂
You Goofy 💀
You’re a bully Will
Will, your apology seemed genuine. You took clear accountability for your actions. That is actually rare today. I am 50 years old and have watched you grow since the Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince days. Not the show, but the music. You grew into an amazing role model and entertained people worldwide. I am simply shocked at your behavior and that you would destroy a 50 year legacy in the making. We all have moments when we do things that are wrong or against our better judgement….but your moment was on national television getting the award of a lifetime and crowning your career. Like I said…shocking. Good luck to you. You obviously know that no one will ever look at you the same way. It is a complete fall from grace. I know that isn’t helpful. But it’s honest and needed to be said.
just say, 'I M FCUK UP, CHRIS' and then, move on.. don't carry burden that has long been gone. u done ur part by apologizing and that's it.. END OF STORY. hey, will, don't push urself so hard and EVERYONE FCUK UP ONCE IN A WHILE.
Great camera work. Excellent production. Great acting too.
I'm glad you're okay. Thank you Will #CLM
Will Smith: “Yaaaaaaa, I apologize everyone, uhhh so let’s all forget about this like it’s rewind time”
There is NO ONE on this thread that hasn't  messed up! 1 more mistake for mankind. sorry you're going through this. Hope I'm not the only 1 on here who remembers you're human. hope you and CHRIS  can get past this screw everyone else 😍 I'll still support you💜
Mans dressed like tiger woods
clm
Will Smith didn't let me down. In that moment a true fan or anyone really could see that he was mentally out of it. Everybody knows what happened and what it was. It was a lapse of adequate judgement, that's all it was. Will Smith is human like everybody else. Hopefully Chris forgives him and we can move on with our lives.
No, bro, you should definitely be ashamed of yourself. It was a shameful thing to do.
ratio
surprised the comments are on. this sucks.
Chris don’t have to accept Will apology. Especially since he did a YouTube apology.
That was a great apology. It's time to move on everybody.
🍋✊CLM! I STAND WITH EMONEY
You're still my favorite Sir.
Nah…I’m cool
CLM ✊🍋 such a brave men
Will needs to talk to Bobby Lee. Dem women will ruin ya.
No
Coming from an actor that will just do the same thing without any consequences, people need to unsubscribe from this channel since this gives him a lot of money
I Smell ya Will 🍋✊
Feels good to hear from you Will! Hope you and your family are doing alright. #CLM
At the end of the day your human and you let your emotions get the best of you and of course he is apologetic from it
Why's this guy always try to sound smarter than he is
Who is Will Smith? This ain’t the guy I grew up watching as a kid. Crazy how things change. It’s a beautiful thing.   My opinion doesn’t matter only Chris Rock’s. [+]
Boo hoo. Woe is me.
Goofy apology video
Don’t let one moment define you. Life is full of moments, this is only one. There were many positive moments before and there will be more in the future.
CLM
Yaaa its rewind time
I stand with Will! #CLM
ITT: NPCs everywhere
Me and my son Eric Lamont Robbins Jr. stand with you Will. ✊CLM
CLM ✊🍋
All the CLM stuff shows the power of bots.  And they use it for bad.
We forgive you Will! #CLM ✊️
Well it's about time. You fucked up. But good to see you own up to it and ask for forgiveness. Hope Chris forgives you.  And I really hope you learned your lesson. I hate to see someone good as you  go through this because of an idiotic behavior.
WITH YOU ALL THE WAY WILL 🍋✊CLM
Spread the movement Will CLM✊🍋
the whole apology video shtick really loses credibility with the intentional editing. if you want to make a public apology like this just flip on the camera and sit down. the end.
How tf do you walk 100 feet and not once stop yourself like bruh you know what you did and you meant to do it
It takes a brave man to own up to his mistakes like that #CLM
I want to believe you Will but I have doubt and they say when in doubt, well it’s probably full of S***. So there’s that. However, good luck and I hope that you are being genuine and that Chris forgives you for what you did. I hope you both heal from this chaos that you caused. You need some serious therapy because you have some deep issues and some darkness to you. I would want a second chance and it will take a while but I am sure Chris and your fans will forgive you too. Keep praying for that chance. 👍🏻 ☮️ 💕 🙏🏻
He would have never done that to a white comedian.
This is the worst apology video I've ever seen, and he's an actor! He is speaking so slowly, one slow word at a time, as if prompted and he isn't collected at all. The video doesn't sound like he is talking to Chris directly, which is the only person he should be addressing (and his family). It sounds like he is trying apolgize to social media and his fans, but he should be apologizing to Chris if he's going to put out a statement video. This seems incredibly fake and heartless. Sorry but it does!
this is the apology of all time
Will you’re inspirational, you’re a great man, mentor and motivator. We all have moments throughout life that we drop the “rules”. It’s how we handle the aftershock that defines truly who we are. I have always looked up to you and now I always WILL!  Stay strong and keep being You!
four months to rehearse and this is what we get. How much takes did this take. What was the box office budget? Who directed it?

This is the dictionary definition of the skull emoji
AY MAN I SMELL YOU BRO 🍋✊ #CLM
Anyway
I was a huge will smith fan but what I saw that night was a sociopath, psychopath, narcissist who literally made that night all about him. Not sure this is sincere or just to test the waters to get back to filmmaking.
WE STAND WITH YOU KING. 🍋✊CLM
Nice apology ego boy
Only a “Hancock” sequel can make up for this.
He reading a script??????
EMONY STANDS WITH YOU #CLM ✊🍋
fart
Narcissistic victims always seem sincere. FOH.
To be honest, why making a video to show it everyone. Why not taking a drink with him in private and apologize
It's the perfectly placed water bottle from Jaden that really makes it 🥲
man if you come back you gotta make irobot 2, its the only way
I don't think you needed to make an apology to be honest, no one really cared except the people that care more about celebrity lives more than their own. People with day jobs and hobbies really couldn't care less what you did. It was funny and it was for public attention. I mean good for you for finally saying something, but I think all of us in the comments could've went on with our lives without an apology from you.
That was still one of the lamest things I’ve ever seen.
I literally don't get the hate.
You farked up big time….not our fault if we see a different man now
That night, you behaved like a child. You had the emotional response of an angry teenager trying to show that he is a man. I am not saying that you are always like this, I am confident that it is not the case, but, there is no way you can explain/justify what happened. You just did it. Do not make it look like a desperate move to glue back pieces together. It's not a PR stunt. Mean it.
You are the GOAT ❤️
Why do all apologies by these big names have to be so dramatic?
Average YouTuber apology:
Even actors are inferior when it comes to YouTube apologies…no one is stronger
Never trust people with Nike air force mids
It takes a real man to stand up and say I was wrong, my respect to you for doing so. I went to see you live at the Dolby Theater and you really moved me with your presentation, I saw where your heart is. Life is about understanding,  learning and accepting love, I truly believe you are good, but even good guys do bad things sometimes, remember what Denzel said, "the devil always comes looking for you at your highest moment", because he knows you inspire, and if he can trip you he can knock over all those behind you that you have touch in a positive way like dominoes, but those who believe and trust in God will never fall they will stop that Domino effect and support you with their love. Keep inspiring, and like you said that night I saw you, keep your mission to show unconditional and everlasting love. My love and hope for the best -Erick.
I appreciate, respect and forgive you ❤️
Keep chris name out your mouth 🤣
Daahhhh it’s apology time
We still love you Will. We still enjoy the great work you do. No matter how many super heroes you play, we know you are HUMAN. None of us know the space you were in, the pressure you felt at the time. Nothing is irreparable. You can’t make people forgive you. They have to choose. Praying you are able to forgive yourself. Many of us have done things we regret. The difference is we are only known in our own little world. If you feel unloved, you’re not. This is one fan, & I know there are many others, who loves you. I don’t know how you believe but God never stops loving us. Things will get better. 💕
Thanks for doing this Will. I still love you.
YOU GOT THIS KING #CLM 🍋
It's ok we forgive you. We know eren yeager manipulate you 🤧
EMONY STANDS WITH YOU #CLM ✊🍋
Well now you can curse in your music now, right?
He is doing more here than many of our leaders ever have. That says alot. I gotta respect that. I truly hope they can make a mends.
Ogre Dude I have not felt like being on my - is anyone else like this? Like the past like two months man I dont wanna be on my computer ever. Like Im so over the computer. I think corona - They can't take me serious if you look at me like that.
We forgive you Will. You are too great an actor to let this completely ruin your career. I'm sure, in time, Chris will forgive you. You are one of the best people out there, you just had a moment of weakness.
Algum brasileiro??
CLM? Comedians Lives Matter?
Despite our innate reaction to the contrary: mistakes aren't worse because they are more public.  People get knocked the hell out over nonsense disputes on the daily. Many end in tragedy far more than a bruised ego broadcast to the world. OMG Will Smith is human! Maybe he doesn't exist on earth just to motivate us! Whatever shall we do?  We have a very broken relationship between celebrity and non. He gets to voice his thoughts and processing and trauma the same as Chris or as any of us. That it sparks ire or reverence is a sign of how we've twisted things.  I don't know, or have business judging, if he's suffering "sufficiently" or whatever. But I do wish we could all help make this a world where this was a Will-to-Chris and associated families discussion.  Plenty of hurting to go around right now for us to be diving into others folks'.
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧
Funny because I was so disappointed in him when he did that LOL doesn't even make sense i don't even know the guy
things has passed on... time to forgive...
Enough of celebrities who don’t deserve a nickel of our respect.
Idk the water sponsorship made it feel like this was trying to capitalize on something
This is a meme XD.
You can tell he's been in intense therapy.
With titles like “It’s been a minute” Will’s Clickbait game has gotten stronger👊
His son wrote on twitter , “that’s how we do it “ .
This is gross 🤮
Another question,  are you mostly apologizing because your career took a dive??
He licked his lips right after saying sorry to Chris. Does this mean he’s not sorry?
We know your sorry and it will take time
I used to look up to this man but damn he’s just actor playing apart and we seen the real him that night…don’t believe a word he just said he only apologized because he was told to
🍋✊ #CLM we stand with you
L Will Smith
Thanks for making this video.  There'll be people that will criticize it, sure, but you've made your statement and people can say what they like but at the end of the day, it's your business, not ours. Looking forward to the next project you're working on.
CLM🍋 ✊
Life goes on. Sure it was a bad moment, but is this really worth lingering on? God we suck as a species...
Bug off!
My guy seriously dressed up for a golf tournament for an apology video.
Apologizing to someone on camera is very different from apologizing in person.
Muhammad Ali is disappointed with you, Will!! 😭😭😢
The amount of love and joy you've put out into the world vastly outweighs this one incident. ❤️👍
this whole video Kappa
No way he actually sighed before the apology LMAOOOOO
68k likes ang 56k dislikes. Yikes.
dude it’s been 3-4 months, why not apology then and why make it public, just dm him saying sorry to make it more sincere
To be honest, i did not see this coming
What's CLM
Will Smith made a lot of money on this video. He should give all the money to Chris Rock’s mother.
Agent: will, wake up it’s time sir Will: time for what Agent: time for the apology tour Will: but haven’t people forgotten about it by now? Agent: have you seen the scripts you’ve been receiving lately? After earth 2 will. Nuff said Will: ok what do we do Agent: we open it up as the most stereotypical, generic public YouTube apology. You will say I’m sorry to litterally everyone on the planet…. Except Chris! Will: done
Yall actually here thinking this matters to you, turn of the wifi and go outside
Isn’t it a strange coincidence that this apology has come out around the time he has been cast in a new role ?
Bruh seen dis Will still good dude we all have moments he human n humble no cap lol stay safe RIP Jak Knight Paul Sorvino pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze 🙏
He's a human being man, let him live. Jeez...
Can someone tell me what CLM means ?
Lmao it took you months to make an apology.
😂
WOOOO CLM !✊
This isn’t sincere at all lol 😂 , you seem like you losing it Will don’t think you alright in the head
I'm just here to dislike the vid.
Wow... and it only took you 4 months! Congratulations!
on s'en fout
Just come out as gay already bro
I grew up watching the tail end of your show the Fresh Prince of Bell Air with my family a couple seasons before it ended. While it was shocking to witness, this apology to the public while generous wasn't needed. It's appreciated though none the less. It's up to Chris to decide what he'd like to say here.  Many will continue to take this personally despite never having met you nor will ever meet you, or have anything directly involved with you so regardless of this outcome, I'm glad you did your part on what made you whole mentally and emotionally.   Now, it's up to Chris to say something when he's ready should he.
Cringe smith
Bruh
Bravo !! This is a altitude of a great man. Great human.
Wtf is CLM 💀💀
It’s so good to see you Will. You are only human and that is never disappointing. One moment does not define a person and all of us can grow from this.
there's High's and lows in life.... when you're a celebrity the highs are super high but them lows bwoy, that's a lot of weight to carry around. I pray this becomes one of those things Chris & Will can look back on in 10yrs as friends.
do this before Emancipation comes out, hmm, the timing seems interesting
🍋✊ #CLM
Arabiannnn nightssss
Hey Will, I don’t know if you’ll see this but we all make mistakes, your an amazing person and you are a kind man, we as your audience appreciate your hard work and what you’ve done to apologize for what the situation was. Keep going man, don’t ever let somebody tell you that you can’t move on with life when its at its toughest, that you can’t be forgiven, that you can’t move on in life for the better. You’re the Man will smith, we as your audience will be here to support you in the toughest of times we truly mean it.
Thanks Will! To be honest (and I mean no disrespect from this) I found this video a lot more relatable than your usual "self help" or motivational videos: but I personally hate all those sorts of videos lol This video however is a lot more relatable. I don't mean we should celebrate negative situations, but I felt you were much more relatable as a vulnerable human being: nobody should aspire to be "Tony Robbins" centered 24/7: it's just not "real".  I think as viewers we were also traumatised to some extent: for me that trauma and that disgust has passed: what is left is empathy for you, not in terms of what you did, but empathy for the pain you mustve also felt: some times the greatest pain we feel is brought on by ourselves. It doesn't mean it's not valid. Sounds like you're doing a great job in processing this though and "telling the right story" to yourself so you get through this in the right way and eventually put it behind you in the right way.   Just continue to "be you": it is enough. We all have parts of who we are we don't like or things we wish we were better at handling. Most of us have traume or anger inside us. They do define you: they are part of you: you can't pretend they don't exist: we make conscious decisions about how we behave every single day and most of us (including you!) successfully chose not to be driven by anger. You just made a mistake, and lost control of that conscious decision making in a moment of raw emotion. It could happen to anyone. You'll try your best to not make that mistake again. But just continue to "be you". It is enough for people to love you. It is enough for people (including your fans) to respect you again. You will lose some friends and admirers but that's OK too. Don't stress yourself trying to "fix" the underlying anger and trauma: recognise it, learn from it, get strategies to cope with it, but you're probably not going to change it. Regardles: you are ok.
Apology? He said “I apologize” a couple times. But never said, Chris I’m sorry.. he never said the words, Chris I’m sorry..
He’s only apologizing because he lost millions of dollars. He saw the consequences and now he’s speaking up. Why wasn’t this made several months ago?
These guys live in a different realm.   Kick rocks.. Smoke another Million. Look around you will. Your whole fam is wrecked except willow it seems.  You live in a realm of confusion.  You accept spousal infedelity.  Your a good man but you've been poisoned unfortunately. If you ever make it back to earth you'll realize non of that was on you . You were manipulated. And you should live by your actions. Not cower.  Your monetarily secure enough to not have to answer to the mob.
You can tell this was made in one long take, not edited when a mistake happened. There are slip ups, words said wrong, genuine mistakes. Just like humans are. People are saying he’s not apologizing to Chris well: he shouldn’t be on here. He addressed that Chris will reach out to him when he’s ready. They have a private relationship and that’s where the apology should happen. Many stars want to fix their image immediately when they make a mistake, posting an apology days later instead of 4 months, like we saw here. It seems like he genuinely took time to process this situation he has created and this is his attempt at letting the world know that he has started to figure it out and he wants to show us how he will grow from this. Just gotta see where he goes from here❤️
People saying it’s too late aren’t getting the point of his video. He wanted to wait so he could properly grow and educate himself on what he had done. I respect the hell out of that. Any other way would’ve felt hallow and forced.

This video would have really meant something a few months ago..kinda feels like you're just trying to make this go away at this point, I hope you are sorry but this video basically accomplishes nothing..much like this comment.
Love how this apology is 11 hours ago but all the good comments is flooding in seconds ago because of a guy with a plain black shirt.
There's a big difference between saying I want to apologize and I'm sorry or I apologize versus I'm sorry. Saying I apologize is half-assed at best it takes a truly strong person to say I am sorry.  Learn that firstm
No, the apology to Chris needs to be in person, not YouTube. You are so priveleged. What are YOUR consequences?? Words are so easy to say. ACTIONS. So outrageous... consequences need to be leveed.
You make movies about other people. You got caught up thinking like King George. The combination of the spirit of King George and your inner problems was a perfect storm.

An apology released on a Friday in the summer after months of preparing and consulting your legal team.  How brave SMH.  Hollywood is full of these candyasses.
Human?  Dmn let us forgive ourselves. Please let us not continue to shame ourselves. Move forward in the now.
It was staged, Chris is a good actor!
CLM BABY WOOOOOOOO ✊
Funny, can guarantee this only happened because someone realized his career is done! He acted vile and disgustingly unprofessional. He pulled a Kanye and took a shining moment from a peer (Q. Love) shameful… shameful!
May you forgive yourself, it's cool. We've all had those times. Yours was televised.  Take some time to center. Stop apologizing and figure out what you gonna do in the next journey in your life.  How do YOU want to be remembered as? Go be him. Love ya
Was this a Scientology thing?
Handle it backstage next time.
You went off of impulse and that’s okay man I hope you and Chris can be okay again
Love you will
Don't listen to the haters.  Your true fans are sending healing love.  Continue your work and get better.  You are not the same little boy in your parents bedroom who couldn't protect your mother.  You are a spiritual being capable of exceeding all limitations.   Get back to that person.  Love from Peggy's Cove NS Canada.
What happened from a neurobiological standpoint is that your brain got triggered, your brain sunk from your cortex (thinking part of your brain) to your brainstem (survival part of the brain where triggers are stored); you went from being regulated and responsive to dysregulated and reactive. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) is the best therapeutic approach to heal the trauma stored in the brainstem. Find a good EMDR therapist to heal your brain.
Honestly out of everything in this video. I respect Will a lot for leaving these comments on
You done bro. I used to have respect for you until your woman did this mess to you. I've seen many dudes get this bad and I just think it's weak.
I lost you when you started talking about how your mission in life is bringing light to other people's lives.  Narcissists apparently can't help but talk about themselves and how great they are (or their mission in life is) even when the moment asks for humility or self deprecation.   Had this video ended at 3:57, it would have been the perfect video.  Peace.
Proud of you Will. 😌

we still love you Will don't worry about it
CLM ✊
Mr. Smith ,unfortunately, we all fall short. It is bound to happen to us all. And anyone that condemns without mercy just hasn't had their moment yet. Yours was just a public stumble.  Fortunately, for you one incident doesn't define the man. Your entire life course will show this as a mere blip on the radar. You are still one of my favorite actors. The majority of your work is something I can watch with my whole family extended included. Not an easy feat today. So Thank You ! for always being a class act. I look forward to your next project.
STAND STRONG, STAND PROUD 🍋✊CLM
Bro couldn't even say sorry
Why are you apologizing? It's the greatest entertainment I've ever had in my entire life. Comedy has surged thanks to you.
Naaaaaaaaaaaah…
apologize to amy schumer, she was so traumatized 😢😢.
Looks like he's forced to be there
Wtf is clm
It was good for me to see this from him not that it should make any difference what i think or feel.  I am glad to see an example of integrity and trying to make things right publicly through being humble.   The attempt was made to reconcile that is all that anyone can do in life.  That is all we are asked to do in AA meetings.  What other people choose to do is out of our control.  Those who i have hurt in the past do not have the same relationship with me today.   It is just part of life and that kind of healing takes a long time if at all when it comes to others.  I know Will Smith doesn't have an AA addiction it's just my way of relating.   It was very cool to see this part of Will Smith.  I hope it proves to help him even if it may not fix or resolve the relationship problem.  He is right with himself and family and did his best to reconcile with friend.  COOL!

What does CLM Stand for
We are all imperfect, let the perfect cast the first stone….A moment does not define a lifetime of you. This is an example to everyone who does something wrong that you can offer a sincere apology that you can be better and you can give back. Chris can choose to forgive or reject this apology that is his right and prerogative, but Will brings hope to everyone who is angry in this world. We need peace we need forgiveness we need healing and we need LOVE…..
I thought he was wearing a high round hat at first.  It was just the light behind him.  Lol.
I will always be a fan.  Anyone who abandons you after one mistake was never a friend; they were an associate.  We all have those moments we wish we could take back.  I wish you the best and look forward to your comeback.  We miss you!
OMG Will Smith did the gratuitous YouTuber Apology Sigh on a YouTube apology video. That wasn’t on my 2022 bingo card.

Ive seen the media try to push his movies lately. Not gonna happen. There's a feeling of disgust when I see his face. I just changed the channel. Youre not getting any attention from me anymore.
Creo firmemente que todos merecemos una segunda oportunidad (si es de corazón). Eres una persona en la que podía admirar con respeto ante de ese "accidente". No voy a negar mi decepción hacia tu conducta inapropiada, pero de nuevo, todos merecemos una segunda oportunidad.

I feel for Will, but I also know he deserves everything he's going through and more. The ramifications for this are incredibly far-reaching and endless.  It's a really rough time for free speech and comedy right now.   I wish him well but I have no idea when I'd ever be interested in seeing him in a movie after this. He's got some serious hills to climb. Maybe if he played an a-hole or something...  Also, we had a lot more questions than that!

Wrong, sir, wrong! Under section 37b of the contract signed by him, it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void, if, and you can read for yourself in this photostatic copy, "I the undersigned, shall forfeit all rights, privileges, and licenses, herein and herein concrained, et cetera et cetera, fax, mentis, incendium, gloria culpum, et cetera, et cetera, memo bis punitor delicatum"!

CLM ✊🍋
Lol idk why you waiting four months to say sorry to Chris, everybody already forgotten about it. You keep saying sorry to everyone but not to Chris you keep saying “my apology.” This apology isn’t that good bro. It’s up to Chris to decide rather he forgives you or not.
Worst part is none of the actors went to see how Chris was. Poor form and spineless from all the actors watching.
We’re human period
You'll never be forgiven if we're being real
I would believe this if this was your real language brother. Yet, this is just another script reading. Get away from your current situation and be better for yourself and your soul. Much love. But this means nothing. I hope you're ok in the future. Chris should have nothing to say to you honestly.
It’s human nature to get caught up in the moment at times. Keeping emotions in check at all times is just not realistic. What happened is definitely shocking but I think most agree that mishaps happen. I feel things will get better once Chris reaches out. Ultimately it’s up to him to forgive you not the public. Hopefully you both find peace after this unfortunate circumstance.
I'm sorry, but please buy my book (Link in the description). 🤡
hey will, how about you give me a million dollars bozo
EROBB221 APOLOGIZE
Humiliation ritual.
Wayyy to late for that apology, if anyone should know if when someone is joking around and when someone is being blatant, it should be him.
Lesson learned on both accounts hopefully  Chris - Be mindful on who you tease and understand that we're all human and some people take offense to something others look past.   Will - if you feel disrespected, use your words. You're great at articulating and people respect you for that
I've seen youtubers do better apology videos. You're not gonna win the Best Apology Video for the year with this Will. Maybe next year.
Does everyone wear white in youtube apology vids? I mean it looks like a whiter grey but, idk.
I actually forgot about this and the video popped up on my recommended and I’m like will we should all forgive him but it’s really up to Chris but we all shouldn’t make a big deal about it forgive forget follow your dreams don’t blame your problems on Will that’s not right 👍
This is family. ❤️
honestly.. 53 years old is a little old to be making a "mistake" like this.. If will was 23 really just becoming a man and learning who he is.. it might be a bit different.. but grandpa's giving apologies is lame..
Man where’s the dislike number when you need it.
Bro I’m still traumatised from that incident.
Is it just me, or is this a little melodramatic?
Xxxtentacion
Not sure what the haters want.  He is a huMan and he did something stupid, haven't we all? Unfortunately it was very public and for the rest of his life, all of our lives, we'll have to live with the consequences.  So... let's move on. John 8:7 [So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.]
I don't give 2 shits about one word he says now.... This is total damage control. I honestly think Will suspected more fans would rally to him. When they didn't it was totally damage control from hear on out
This looks genuine to me. He is sorry. I forgive him.
All Humans deserve to be forgiven when asked to do so, it is what makes us ask in the first place. If we keep hate in our hearts when one of us fails, then we will quit being human
“There’s no part of me that thinks that was the optimal way to handle that situation”  Guys he may be onto something here.
Ofcoarse folks who are anti black peoples will forgive him , they just love supporting black peoples who are detrimental to our community. Just scroll in the comment section and see them accepting his apology as if it up to them .
lul
Will is definitely trying to do the work.. He's under immense pressure and it takes understanding of the nuances and complexities of his position or role in life to get through it. Clever interview. He answered fans questions not a reporters questions..  Another way to interview has been invented. Signed by Will Smith!
Thats how we do it! Does that rig a bell?   Will: i like to apologize to my kids 😂
If any of us did that to chris we would have been arres ted.
You used to be a hero in American entertainment man now I get annoyed hearing about you
XDDDDDDDD
Bruh
Grace and forgiveness has always been extended to me and I will extend it to you.  I think Hollywood has caused harm to your spirit that you may not even be aware of.  God Bless you on your journey to find peace.  You can't give that to others if you cannot give it to yourself.
As much as I don't like Will, I can literally see in his eyes that the apology is sincere.  You know when people are genuinely sorry. But I still can't fathom how he wasn't arrested.
It took you 4 months to come up with that?
we know inside you it's not something you want to do, we still love you
You didn't even apologize to Chris, what a load of nothing.
We have all done some things that we are not proud of you are forgiven 🙏🏼
Get yo apology out of my suggestions!
What's with the high production value and changing angles? So fake.
Too little. Too late.
Everyone sitting here listening to a black privileged man apologize for acting dumb at an awards show, there is no racism, this is peak black
We moved on homie. You were forgiven long ago 🙏🏾
I especially was fond of the “I’m trying not to be ashamed of myself” part.  No.  Be ashamed of yourself.
What was the point tho
This is why the dislike count was important.
The deep breath at the start had me in tears 😖👌
If the dislike button could still be seen, this moment would be the most funny fuckin thing of all Celebrity YouTube💀
There's one thing I take away from this, Will reads like he's in the first grade....
He sounds like he was scared
I really dgaf
People out here in the comments really saying "I forgive you" or "I don't forgive you".. It's not your place to forgive or not, you weren't tied to this situation. Ever. The only thing that connects you to the whole situation is the fact that you watched.
Its greats that he apologized for what he did but, it feels like it's to late for redemption.
Good, now apologize for making Aladdin
Will is taking full accountability and delivered a complete full apology. As Tyrese would say, "What more do you want from me?!"
Will looks so broken!!
Love you man. Chris too.
I really cant believe any word he says now… damn
HOG RIDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
I think this in long haul has too do with what ever Chris & the others think.  Thank you for putting your words together in a wise way.  Hopefully, someday you can conversation with Chris & maybe his mom.  Apologize to them one on one.  Just make sure you are both ready to hear the truth. I’m guessing there a lot of pain being held.  It really doesn’t matter in the end if the public is cool or not cool.  You all just are in the publics eyes.  Thanks for manning up & admitting you where wrong. Lastly saying you are sorry. That a huge step in the right direction.
these reddit amas are getting weird
This was a good apology video. I believe he means it.
Should have lowered the production value and just made video off mobile. Spinning it up like this just makes it all feel disingenuous.
POV the 5 page essay is due tomorrow morning and you only have 2 sentences done
This man needs to leave that woman. His life will drastically change for the better.
Can’t wait to see the memes that come from this.
😂😂😂this is so funny bruh
Obviously there would have been more questions. Should have apologised to more people - everyone watching......
Hope Chris forgives you
I wish others can really check themselves before saying things they don’t mean. I mean when your writing comments being negative makes you weaker and makes the person posting this braver. And the fact that no mater what there’s always going to be hateful negative comments, but can try to be positive. Sometimes it takes time to apologize to somebody because during that time ppl need time and space and does actually take time to forgive and sometimes don’t. When apologizing right away doesn’t always work sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t. But does take time. Especially this incident. Or any other kinds of incidents but still gotta think how ppl need time and space before mending each other. The fact will smith is trying to apologize and telling all the fans and everyone in the world because he’s trying to do better. We’re not perfect but we are human beings and have feelings. . And sometimes apologies doesn’t always flies all the time. The fact the will smith is not rehearsing neither he’s not acting like this is staged because he is taking time to lay this off. And hopefully Chris will forgiven him. You know celebrities go through slot like Britney and Lindsay but they turn things around. And it does give time buildup to forgive. And will is taking he’s time and showing he’s empathy if he’s apology. So I hope others can understand that he’s not the only one in life that goes through this and builds up. Thanks for understanding.
🤓🤓🤓
The only way to resolve this is with the tortilla challenge. Let's make it happen
Can't believe he finally finds the courage to apologize to Chris, and it's just took him 4 months after all of it was over! Bravo Will, I can't tell if this is an act or a genuine apology, you're a good actor.
Keep your head up Will. We all fall short. All you can do is apologize. You can’t go back in time. Obviously, there was a lot on you. But it’s not what’s on you, it’s what’s in you! Your a good dude that mad a bad choice. Love is blind, but never forget self preservation comes first!
YOU ARE NOT A P.O.S
Love You man, we all make mistakes and bad judgement of epic magnitude. If we can't forgive others for their mistakes then we shouldn't be forgiven for ours.
Will We forgive you but it’s not us that really matters - it’s Chris … But we all still love you Champ. it’s just a smack 🤷🏾‍♂️ no big deal .
I fell you will 🥺
💙 Only human. Man made a big mistake... still a huge fan and will continue to have respect for Will Smith's great accomplishments on and off the screen 💙
Lucky there’s no dislikes
too little too late
ok but i think the political and economic state of the world right now is more important than this
Jada's doing you no favors.
Professional trained actor makes a YouTube apology video to soften the consequences of his disgusting behaviour.  So no, I don't buy it. He's not sorry. He's trying to save his business. I hope Chris presses charges.
i apologize ≠ im sorry

Hey :-)  Must be tough to have do this so publicly. Take care. You are still my fav actor and Musician. I tested positive covid the day you did the 'thing'  Seems weird, but my whole isolation and being sick, you were in the news constantly... I was kept really occupied. I hope you come to some peace in your life. And really look at you want in your future :-)  Like I did when I had covid and you did that "thing" the same day :-)
LET'S GO, HE DID THE YOUTUBER APOLOGY SIGH.
Imagine

There is no hope if we can't forgive.  I still feel the hurt deeply from that moment, but  I very much look forward to the day when both you beautiful black men can hug in forgiveness and laughter again.  It is possible - we are the kind of people that's built like that.
hopefully chris rocks response. to close this issue. were now friends again will. thank you for this video, been months since i unsubscribe 😅
Maaaan Will don’t no body care about what you did. It was the heat of the moment situation. It’s not like you stomped him out on stage. You messed up but I’m still gon see your movies. Stay up my G, you only human
Youtuber apology done by Will Smith. What kind of backwards stuff is that?
GET A DIVORCE HOMIE.
Take your hat off, no manners and lack of respect to the party you're "apologising" to.
I don't know Man...I just don't know there is A Movie Out there You almost Verbatim the whole scene to what you did . I suppose every step taken Back from that night is better than nothing
Will should smoke a blunt.
Doesn't even say sorry to Chris what a laughable apology!! No one feels bad for you
YouTuber apology moment
Apologize? How about say you're sorry
Thank you Will, life is too short!  I slept 3 months in a coma and God woke me up!  Now, it takes  a lot to go there!  It's not worth it Will!
We all make mistakes healing and wellness dear Will
Asking for forgiveness needs Courage. Will, everybody made mistakes in front of God.
Although what Will did wasn't right by Chris or his fans, I think the man made a mistake throughout a career of excellence since a very young age and under the scrutiny of the public eye and he deserves a second chance. Will was able to become one of the most humble actors of his generation, though he is one of the biggest stars in the world, and dedicated a big portion of his time and energy to help and motivate others.   The mane deserves a chance, he made a mistake just like everyone who is reading this right now, including me the person writing this comment. We can believe that Will is unredeemable just because we made one mistake, because I'm sure everyone gas made a mistake through their journey to become who they are right now that would also make then unredeemable.
Thank you, Will! Many of us are happy to see you open up about this, especially about your feelings about letting people down. I'm sure Chris appreciates it too, and I hope the two of you get to talk soon. Much love! ❤
The Greatest YouTube Apology of 2022
Boohoohoo 🎻🎻🎻
Too late ⏰
Nope
aee u reading?
Took 4 months to set up that room.
Just Water lol...
To all the people whining in the comment section, This apology is not for you. Stop getting offended for people who didn't ask you.
Thank you Will Smith  for being accountable. To have the courage to publicly admit and identify your offensive ways is a great act many of us should follow.  You’re a human act of someone evolving. 💯king smith 💯
Will ❤️💪🏽
Either all of it's real or none of it is.
Will: "You asked a lot of fair questions that I wanted to take some time (5 months) to answer."  First question: "Why didn't you apologize to Chris in your acceptance speech?"  Will: "It's all fogged up, it was all fuzzy."  5 months to deny you did not want to bring yourself to equal levels with Chris at that moment and admit you were just too proud and angry. Either make an honest video or just don't.
My stance will always be "They're human. They are bound by the laws of existence to make mistakes." That's really all there is to it. It's up to Chris to forgive him or not. Good friendships have things like this happen all the time and they come back stronger. Let's just hope it's the same here.
This is hilarious. 😂 The fact that it’s one of those “self reflect” “i sat down and thought” about it is so cliche, at this point this is not an apology this is just one of those I’m saying sorry cause he “owes” it to his fans. However an apology, a true one, is not one that you should record or tape. This is just for the clicks/views.
He's acting, no one talks like this  "nuances" "complexities" "optimal" this is a prepared speech
What some people fail to understand is that sometimes an apology is a waste of time. Let your actions do the talking.
I don’t like vague apologies like that.
Will Smith is officially a Youtuber this apology video proves it
Love you Will❤❤❤
51k dislikes lmfao
I'm waiting for the Chris and Will sit down for them to talk publicly. If they do it public for us to see
We all make mistakes and we learn from them and do our best to move on as a better person.  No judgement here.  We are humans and we will make mistakes along this wonderful journey of life.
This is up there with the Logan Paul apology.
The greatest YouTube apology. trained for months to come to this😆
🤡
It's been a minute????  It's been 4 months.  Did it take that long to learn your apology lines?
I really don’t care but 4 months too late and sounded scripted all the way
All these comments giving Will validation is nothing. At the end of the day, it’s Chris who was the victim and if he chooses to forgive him then so be it, if he doesn’t, that’s also valid. People in the comments need to stop speaking on Chris’s behalf.
Now we just hope it doesn’t become a massive internet meme.
i didnt think it was right that he apologized so late but the fact he had to think about this apologie and put thought i js think that it is a good think that he still apologized and Chris should have a talk with him
This teleprompt reading was about himself, not chris
Never let one moment in time define a person.  Will has done so much good and inspired so many people. You will be back champ.
Will Smith playing Will Smith, just like any Will Smith movie.
Is Will Smith a youtuber in disguise? Because this was a textbook youtube apology right here.
LMFAO
Thank you sir!! Much appreciated much respect and much love!! We're only human!!
Will's publicist running damage control it looks like. If he cared about apologizing he would be talking to Chris not to YouTube. 😂
You didn’t let me down Will ♥️
50K dislikes, if anyone's wondering.
nope, this is literally a youtuber apology lol
you have finally become an offical youtuber hah, welcome
everybody make mistake right or wrong
Te amamos Will y todos cometemos errores...  Así que fresco y sigue con tus proyectos 😉  Te queremos ver en pantalla 🤗
We expect so much from celebrities.   They are human too. Much respect for you and Chris. Praying for you Will 🙏
nice performance clown 🤡 we know that you're career is declining, you should've done this earlier.
It was better when you just shut up about it. Enjoy your hundred of millions of dollars and go away. Stop trying to sell your 30 dollar book. You have enough money. Geesh!
Lmfao, 4 months and this is the best he could come up with 🤣🤣🤣
He really squeezed out that apology. Something about this didn't seem genuine.
Jajaja cuck smith
Does anyone know that brand of water on the table? His ad really sold me!
Yo iRobot.  #leavethischick
إذا أحد صفعني أمام ملايين الناس سوف أنسي خلال ساعات فقط لكن الناس هم من عليهم التوقف عن الكلام فيما يجرح الآخرين
This video didn't really need to exist, this could have all been done in private and then announced, cause nobody except movie executives care about this video
Apology accepted and we will be able to be friends again. :)
Takes balls to say that on youtube, you are ok Will I respect you man!
"Why didn't you apologise to Chris in your acceptance speech?"  "MY P.R. Team didn't tell me to until now"
Too little too late
I feel bad that this situation didn't change my opinion on will. Everyone has drama. The fact we saw it changes nothing. It coulda happened even if we didn't see. He is a person who made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. And I'm sure will is being affected by this whole situation
No Will..........just no.....
Idk it doesn’t seem like he’s being himself and really going into depth on why he would do that, and what he was thinking at the moment/ the backstory with Chris. I feel like if he gave his perspective and acted like a real person and not a robot reading from something I would learn to forgive him more.
Really should not have done this. This looks more addressed to US than Chris. The ONLY person who needs to be hearing this is Chris and Chris’  family and Will’s family. This reeks of desperation to get mercy from the court of public opinion and it puts the focus BACK on Will and not on Chris. I’m not buying this. Even airing publicly the response from Chris’ camp was wrong! He just should have laid low, Indefinitely.
Damage control. This video wouldnt exist if it wasn't for Will Smiths PR team
I understand that what he did wasn’t good, and I accept your opinions, whether you want to forgive him or not. But at least he made a video, apologizing. Even though it took him a long time, late is always better than never. Again, I do understand if you don’t want to forgive him, this is just my point of view.
Not to be rude. Bro kinda reminds me of Jussie Smolllet with the beard.
Those without the youtube extension can't see but there's a 10:9 like to dislike ratio
Staged..
This is a hard one..I still feel bad for Chris..
Any comment you leave on a video like this half of the replies will be you getting absolutely blasted by that guy on twitter for years. So all I'm gonna say is...            Never Gonna Give You Up
I forgive you Will . I still look up to u . I know that this hasn’t been easy for you. But we all make mistakes and we need to learn to forgive Will . Because none of us are perfect.
This produced 'apology' did not come from the heart
Bruh big L
Imagine taking 4 months just to apologize. At least he did apologized.
This is the most YouTube apology like YouTube apology I've ever seen, you can't get any more generic than this.
Made sure to get that "Water" represented in the video. Way to even make this somehow benefit you....
So proud of you Will happi to see you are back you were definitely missed I’m rocking with you and praying for you always💛🙏🏾
Relaxa
Time will tell how genuine this is, but I believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt.
66 thousands Likes and holding. Nothing to see there…
Another performance…
classic cinematic sit with a big sigh, truly one of the apologies of all time.
Cinematography is a bit to good for an appology. But it's a step in the right direction I guess
Sometimes when we're ashamed it's because we SHOULD be.  Used to love your movies, now I am thru.
L+ratio+improper English usage go back to school
Will said it best: "this is probably irreparable". Yep, it is indeed. You will have to live forever with the consequences. This looks like a 'damage control' speech, not an apology.
bro what this guy should start an acting career
Can he beat Goku tho?
even with dislikes hidden for most people, this video has 49 thousand dislikes 😂
Will, you had a very bad day in public eye.  Keep doing your work and get better.  Nobody is perfect and this too shall pass.
For those of you wondering this video has about 49k dislikes at this time...
We are all human. We all make mistakes. This lapse of judgement in the span of a minute should not define him. I'm certain many of us would have reacted the same way. No one is perfect. But we can strive to be the best we can be. By apologizing, by forgiving, and by building up one another.
It can be a be bunch more minutes. You've gone Hollyweird and I'm done with you.
People make mistake.  Doesn't matter how successful you're.  All human will make a mistake.
it sounds exactly like the times where you and the bully were called to the principals office and the principal forced the bully to apologize to you lmao
The meme is funny! The damage was minimal, and the forgiveness is?
It took him like 4 months to say all this, but let’s be honest that we were already expecting an apology from that moment, it’s all kind of up to Chris to forgive him.
Gosh I forgot all about you and what happened. I mean were you  thinking we were all wondering when you are coming back? Dude if you have a good movie out I'll go see it. What you did was sucky. But unless Chris forgives you? I don't really care
Gotta love the placement of the lighting to look like a halo, bravo production team.
2:53 nothing to smile about brother.
Ahh, its rewind time
Don't worry and keep going you are a legend
it was all an act they’re very good actors and that was a good scene lol
There is a thing called "healthy shame" - the world could use more. That's part of what keeps us decent. And the apology? OK, but why the logo on the hat? Now it's marketing.
HE IS HUMAN… we’re also humans (y’all should remember)
We all love you WILL but we don’t need this apology Chris does. Chris didn’t deserve that. I hope you’ve learned from this situation and handle things differently next this.
Now apologize for YouTube rewind
Thank you Will. Rooting for you and Chris
1/10
I’m glad he apologized, but we all act up sometimes. Good for him tho
Will Smith demonstrating his acting prowess... I'm in!
lmao get  real
You haven't learned yet "Bell Air"
Good apology. 👍🏽
Really sorry? Go on Rogan and talk about it for real.
I will not judge you  I love you
You shouldn’t have to apologize to your fans… I still admire you and your work.  Every single person in this world has the right to be mad, to don’t like what people say, to react to verbal aggression… that was the way you reacted, and in my opinion, any ordinal human being could have had the same attitude. Don’t feel like you are less than amazing!  Keep going! Just be yoyurself and keep fascinating us with your work! Be good! 😊
Did this really need to happen I can only imagine he’s apologizing because of legal things like maybe to get more rolls they had him do it idk but I don’t think he needed to apologize
Almost, but not quite, missed the timing on that one.
YB is better
best apology video
its been 4 months bruh youll be aight
Three words " I am Sorry"
This is a event in history that will be there forever.
Initially, I didn’t think he was sincere. But as the video went on and he apologized to Chris’s mother, took on full ownership, said he was committed to bettering himself and how he deals with his anger. I felt that he was being as honest as he can be in this moment.
It sure did take a lot time for you to say that
Big L bro
Good for you brother🙏🏾…Everyone has the right to heal🧐
Why
Hard to see this, as much as i loved will smith before this accident its hard to just be okay with what happened after a apology video. I still need time to see will like I used to. But at least he apologized to chris and his mom.
crazy how he has to apologize publicly when he already apologized to all those directly affected and who would actually care
It took four months before he noticed his royalty checks started to 📉
I respect an apology
Will smith is having a hardtime to piece together those problems goddamn
CANCELED
Damn, didn't know we'll get The Pursuit of Happyness part 2 after all this years. Great acting on that crying bit Will, keep it up
Fresh and Fit podcast covered this....
Why didn't you leave when they asked you to then???  You're sorry that people are upset with you. Nothing more, nothing less.
Will Smith is a actor therefore his response was like another Movie Role. He is acting and this is not genuine. I agree he is a POS.
this is so fake, your looking at one of the best actors in the world, if you can't see through this then damn...
I’ve been thinking for months now yeah he screwed up big but thank you Will for everything good you’ve brought me in my life. He’s human too.
It is meeting all of the criteria of a youtube apology video.
You should've said this to him personally or by other means, instead of Social Media. That is how real men handle their "personal" (beef) business. I'm just sayin'...😶
you don't deserve an apology, this sounds like a script. shame on you
I looked up to you ..I know your human but dammit your WILL SMITH
This is an extreme narcissistic person putting on a show due to people not applauding his decision to “man up”  My oldest idol is dead to me now. I wish I could unwatch I am legend as many times as I did.
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Took him long enough
That's a bait. You just want to have a career again. Disgusting actor.
Bet 500 dollars he's looking at a script
I appreciate you, Will for  addressing your fans and taking  responsibility of what happen. You are human and I'm still your fan and always praying for you as well as your family.
47k dislikes? Yall are being way too hard on this man.
❤️👊🏾!!!
Will smith hasn’t made a YouTube video this bad since YouTube rewind ⏪!!!
The problem with the internet is if he had apologised immediately after, then people would be mad at him. Him apologising now, after all this time, he’s still going to get hate.
you took your sweet time.
I was disappointed but time will heal things
Proud of him. 👍
To be honest people over reacted like bruh I don't give an f
No apology here. He is just making excuses to feel better. Just trying to rationalize it...
It's been quite longer than a minute. Do you not know how long that is?
Whoever put that glowing thing behind Will should be fired from the industry. I can’t stop looking at Will’s big glowing bubbly hat 🤦‍♂️
I don't forgive you but damn, that's a good youtuber apology video. Keep it up, man.
Language
We are all human, and we all make mistakes. The important thing is to take a moment and reflect and try to do the right thing once again. So much judgment, as if actors are not allowed to make mistakes. And yes, it’s up to Chris to forgive your actions. To me you are still the Will I love to watch and that one mistake isn’t going to erase all the good you have done so far 🤗 💙
Stop trying to please everyone and you'll be fine, just be yourself
Feel bad for will smith people wanna hate him for smacking somebody like a man ain’t supposed to defend his women gen z soft this generation of men are weak
Saying "Chris, I apologize" isn't really an apology, is it? It's a way to deflect from actually saying "sorry", which I'm not sure you are yet. Like I hear you say to his mom "I want to apologize", but again, no sorry. Don't just say you want to apologize until you can actually muster the humility to utter the actual words that comprise a legitimate apology!
You can tell he really didn't want to apologize. "I apologize to you" Lol how generic how about an "I'm sorry"...? Textbook YouTube apology.. smdh!
youre the greatest 🙏❤️
It’s hard to think he’s being genuine when there’s a JUST water bottle there 💀💀
🥰
So why did he laugh and then switch  up? 🤔 ppl are so gullible
Classic YouTuber apology video, 10/10 on point
This guy should become an actor!
Oh well well well isn’t it too late
Actors gonna act.
Don’t apologize gen z soft
Hi Will Smith, I hope you are well. Passing by to say that I admire you a lot and that I wish that everything will be well, that you will overcome all this. You are a good person. Hug from Brazil that loves you. 🙏🏼
This apology is so bad that it’s like it tripped underwater. Now who, in the hell of it, trips, underwater?
To little to late , ditch the missis bruv
everyones fallible.
Damn, thanks for wearing your merch and profiting off this video.  You really did change.
I love you will and you’ll always have a fan in me❤️
Damn. On screen text and sighing off screen? This man is inventing new strats for the YouTube apology video
Will Smith on his way to become a full on youtuber with that note by note classic "apology" video.
Fool
See, this guy isnt so bad. He knew what he did was wrong.
Man the apology youtubers have taught Will greatly
The world is sick, love is the cure.
he did nothing wrong
Standard YT apology format lmao
Dude you should have been arrested! You have made fun of people over the years plenty of times best thing to do now is just take yourself off the internet and go live your life, no one's interested in you anymore. I still can't understand why this dude isn't in jail just boggles my mind!
Why do people even care about any of this celebrity drama bullshit? Lmao
Lots of crisis/ damage control professionals put this together. Also there's no doubt in my mind that Jada's reaction didn't cause this.
u fell off
It took 4 months to think about it?
Sometimes we do regrettable things and they haunt us when we look back. Not to take away how embarrassed Chris is and how disrespected he felt but I’m sure Will is feeling incredibly embarrassed and will probably feel this for a very long time.
Big L
Man. To never face any real obstacles in life. It must be so hard being rich and famous..😞
He apologized time to move on
My nigga forgot to apologize lmaooo
Why wait to apologize for four months 💀
Not a single person on the earth can judge him as if they haven't done worst because we all have.
Don't worry about it Will     Nobody can genuinely generate hatred for a cuck
I wish I was at my pc this would be an absolute joy to edit
Will Smith is just a perpetual social media machine by this point. Truly pathetic.
For such a good actor this is your worst performance.  And i saw Gemini Man
This smells like lies and pandering...
Apologies is the first step... but actions speak louder than words... devote your time now to helping others deal with anger... show those you "disappointed" you really do give a s..t
Remember kids...  Will is a good actor :)
"Damage Control, to Major Will.."  🎶🎵🚀🪐🌠
You know it's a YouTube apology video when the video starts with a big *sigh...*
somehow this is all Jada’s fault.
You can see that he is going through it… people put Will on a pedestal but he is a human who had a rough start in life but worked so so hard to break the cycle. His dad hurt his mom and Will in his book mentioned how horrible he felt for not being able to protect her. I wonder if something got triggered in him when he saw another man going after the woman he loves. Yes, it was wrong but we’ve all made mistakes in life and most of us don’t have to deal with the aftermath so publicly. It’s great to see an example of a man taking responsibility for his actions and doing the work. I hope Chris and Will can heal and move forward ♥️
Nuances and complexities LMAOOOO. I feel like it was pretty straight forward.
What a scripted, false and robotic speech
yb better
The amount of uhm in is video is a ton
Leave her plz
When he said that he was human and made a mistake at the end of the video it sounded like he was reading it off of a TV screen💀💀💀       🪨👋
The reason dislikes aren't on yt anymore.
bruh i loved u but its too late
Way to man up and apologize and make amends Will! Props to you! Only positive things for you here on out!
❤️
It’s incredible that he managed to create  the text book definition of an apology video with just 4 months of training 💀
I dislike this
It's rewind time
Will Smith making bucks off the views here.
❤️
The biggest problem here is the fact that people will instantly compare this to the countless YouTuber apology videos out there.
idk what happun i just like wild wild west morbieussy
4 months ago this happened. Why now?
I give it a B tier, it's a pretty solid apology but it's also generic
"When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time."  -maya angelou  Your acting in this isn't even that good.
Apology accepted, so should do others. It happend, shouldn't happen again, but its time to forgive and move on, and make it better Keep yah head up Will, much love.. you will always be a great guy and actor to me!
I want a refund!
Might be time to dump that psycho, Will, you can only cuck so long
The man is broken. He made a stupid mistake and has apologized for it. What else does he needs to do for crying out loud?
Goofy Ahh Apology 💀
and he still didn’t apologize LMAO
Man I don't care, I love you both. Grew up with you both. It was a ridiculous thing that happened, and I'm just a nobody who this didn't affect.
It's a bit late considering this happened 4 months ago but I've seen longer wait times. Very good youtuber apology tho you forgot to include the dog.
Will was able to (nearly) perfectly pull off the YouTuber apology video after only 4 months of training.
Uh
I wish people could publicly see how many dislikes you got~
Forgivenen
You didn't need to make a video and post it to youtube. You just needed to send it to the one guy that mattered.
took four months of training to get the youtube apology video right.  Well don Will
Apology out just in time before his new movie comes out.... Good try bro 😂
keep my wifes name
Best acting. 10/10.
Must be a new movie coming out soon.
I still love you, Will. redemption. 💙
“There’s no part of me that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment.”  All I can say after hearing that is fear women! 😭
For those curious, the likes currently sit at 66k, while the dislikes are at 45k as of 8pm 7/29/22.  Source: I have a browser extension that shows it.
Jaden Smiths, Just Water brand seems strategically placed on the table next to him. Seems a little inappropriate.  Not a time to be plugging products.
Y’all either going to let him apologize and move forward or don’t come here at all he feels remorseful so y’all adding to it just says y’all on the bandwagon of kicking folks while they down
I see Jada's boyfriend told Will he needs to apologise
It's all cool... but that lamp behind your head is pretty unfortunate, it reminds me of Coneheads :(
I was so disapointed being a child of the 80s and looked up to Smith from the other side of the world, seeing him great movies through the last three decades, and suddenly he just lashes out on a collegue and friend like that infront of million eyes worldwide.  Like the cool and fun Will Smith could act like this? Sure its not the end of the world, but as a fan it was weird in a perspective that i would never thought Wil would be a person that could do such thing.   No i still think Wil is a great actor and all the good memories he gave me and others through movies and series and all that is not erased, i just simply see the 2022 version of smith is not the same smith that i grew up rocked.    But ofc someone should be able to make a mistake but there is also a price, but with time certain things will automatically heal, but idk, hard to get that Smith vibe again, maybe in the future cuz the memories dont fade. Being a superstar aint easy, and everything that comes with it, hopefully you figure it out.  Cheers from Sweden!
Im glad that he eventually said something but like 4 months...?
clown behavior
We love you it’s okay. Sending you love!
I forgive you man
Millions of followers Millions of $ and a Famous actor apologizes   WS a Man who has brought joy & Laughter to so many through his skill set ...Today only a completely clueless person would not see this apology WS is conveying here as another Actor who will be back in the saddle with no real fallout..'Nuff said.
Καρδαμύλης και σαφετης ότι καλύτερό.
As you can see Will Smith was inspired by Logan Paul and Travis Scott to make this beautiful and unforgettable apology video for the audience to see
"Thanx y'all" with a x, nice.
Who really cares!!!
Nah, you're done.
This is the greatest apology of All Time
sorry this is too much like an infomercial. Very messed up bringing Chris Mother and Family into this. This just feels so staged, not real at all. Get a life.....
Too little too late. I’m done with the man, the brand and the family. Live better.
Bro…you are not my friend. Wtf was that
Love you will smith … and praying for you
Proud of you for this Will. Still a fan of both you and Chris. I hope this can be the beginning of a turning point.
u spittin some 2k
Honestly I don't believe his apology like for it took him four months to apologize but hey he's human too so I don't know if it's genuine or pr'd just never know but it's a start
I just keep hearing Kendrick "look what I've done for you". Will has given us so much at the expense of being human. He is has always had to be perfect. It was a human moment from a man who has given us perfection. I am sad for him and sad for Chris.
This is brave.  Sometimes a person can push the wrong button at the wrong time.
Dang will
A little bit too late.
I’m not ready to feel good about Will Smith yet - I looked up to him and believed in him and how he acted wasn’t just terrible in and of itself but it’s a terrible example to set. That said, I do know that people are more than their worst moment and that extends to Will, of course.
It's ok Will we all are human.
Me:  This is a genuine and sincere effort on Will's part to improve.  Skeptical Me:  Will doesn't want his movies to end up in the $2 bin at the Dollar Store.
I still agree with Andrew Schwartz!!!
Still will never be forgotten , he pretty much screwed himself and his family forever unfortunately
Sure
Will peloamor você só defendeu sua esposa, não foi certo dar um tapa, mas pelo menos você fez algo pra defender ela
It took to long for u to really apologize u smacked him in front of the whole world then went on stage and cried like you were a victim. And even in this apology video u talk more about ur "trauma" then the apology. I'm not saying ur apology is not sincere but it still seem like ur trying to be the victim.
Nope
Lemon clm ✊
With all that’s  happening in the world why is this still news..I swear this apology was not necessary. Like really who cares!
Can we bring back the dislike button so I can dislike it
gg, respect
Nothing says a sincere apology like a heavily produced multi-cam video with preselected questions.
My guys a literal robot. He sits down, sighs, and then proceeds to just "Why. DIdnt. You. Apolo... Gize. In. Yo...Ur. Accept... Ance.. Speech..."
I do not care . Seriously . If it was any other joe no body would care . But when it is 2 famous people every body pretend to care 😝🤪🤣🤣🤣
man you crazy
Well said
*Lill Lmith*
It’s too late 💀💀
About 4 months too late... you read the "prompt" questions like a robot. Whoever runs your PR... fire them, this is straight trash. Super robotic and just going through the motions.
This man is my childhood so it’s hard to see him brought so low. I hope he can get back to where he was before. I hope Chris can heal and    they can work it out.
Dawg💀
cringe L
The real question... Why did security not escort him out? Why was he allowed to even accept his award? Why did he get a standing ovation afterwards? That's the truely insane thing here... Will is a human and can be forgiven.. He totally made a mistake.. but why TF didn't anybody do something at the time?
Tarnished should seek the guidance of grace
Oh I wish the dislike buttons where still on this app XD.
who cares about that, Jesus...
🥰🥰🥰🥰So glad to see you
This is all Scrip Writers from his PR. If you buy this youre fools xD
Never have I wanted to see a like to dislike ratio more
lol okay
Took ur time
Great acting
It is better that you had better then you lie did you line is terrible you wouldn’t have a job if you had to rely on your line for your job she did have a lot to do with it because whenever you were laughing before she rolled her eyes and then you got to do that after she rolled her eyes you’re sick people
Lol 4 months later. What's the point. It's been to long. You missed your shot.
I mean this is really late tbh
Were you fogged out while you were partying too that night ?
Rise, Tarnished!
Let’s not over judge him we all have bad moments in our lives we have done something bad but that aside I think will smith is facing depression and he needs to take a year off acting and media focus on him his health mental status.
Its 44k dislike til now still counting...
Get that toxic woman out of your life.
All things considered, the fans are trying to figure Will for his late apology to a physically attacked man who apparently isn't even ready to speak on this subject.
LEAVE THAT WOMAN WILL. ASCEND
The size of this guy's head....
Everyone makes choices that later they regret. We are all Human! And for those who choose to hold that over your head where never a real Will Smith Fan anyway, Let ‘em Go!!!  And what is meant to be with Chris and your relationship, is what it’s meant to be! Let God handle that! #PhillyStrong #PhillyLove #GodsChild

He is a lot more sincere when apologising to his own family though.. I did not feel he is sorry when he apologised to Chris..
Right in time for Bad Boys 4.
Will could have stopped all of this the very next day, with the gift of a new Ferrari parked in Chris's driveway -- with an apology note on the windshield.
“It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, but you can lose it in a minute.”― Will Rogers
Cringe
He really did make a severe and continuous lapse in his judgement.
Most people never apologize.  So that is good Will.  And yes; we all make many mistakes.  Keep your head up.  Love for Chris.
Will Smith is a true YouTuber, he’s even got the apology video perfectly done
Humillastes a un hombre frente a miles de personas,no vales nada will smith ni vos ni tu clan ni esa peladita que siempre te traiciona
Can’t believe Will was able to nearly perfectly pull off the YouTuber apology video after only 4 months of training.
That will take time and patience if it will happen. In the mean time all you can do is all you can do. Prayers for both sides of this spectacle.
And now he is monetizing this video, what an apology!!
This mans acting skills are impeccable.
We love you will. Everyone makes mistakes. Much love. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
When rich people apologise, its like listening to a corporate company say "sorry". It's just a stunt to save what little image they have left.
It takes a real individual to take responsibility for their actions. Much respect Will. Much love🙏🏽❤️
All good dude. Make another alien flick and we straight 😅
Whatever the circumstances, he is still my favourite actor🥺😍
Whats up with these comments, like who actually cares anymore? Not to be rude if anyone will find it rude, but like, when was this?
We all make mistakes, but that one was a beauty
This is a bit late man, why it took him so long? Because now he is not getting contracts with anyone. Nobody wants to hire him. Will SMH!!! This is just a PR strategy!!! 😌😌😔😔😔
Good acting. Almost bought it. 👍
Are you okay Will?
one mistake doesnt define a whole person. Chill tf out. I pray for chris and wills mental health in all this. Having a friend do this to you must be devastating.
4 months too late, dead career and deservedly so.
Will Smith's face is all puffy from all the big stariod shots he gets every week and it looks like will  smith  is growing his beard of forgiveness
You for sure he’s not going to watch this textbook YouTube apology well trained and very much to late. Still love you will we all make mistakes
Said it exactly how it was written for him.
You are NOT wrong, but Chris is.
Thank you Bro. Love you for being vulnerable and open. I see you bruh.
???????????PLEASE
Why did you agree to be in After Earth?
66k likes 44k dislikes 😃?!
Bozo
We all make mistakes, and sometimes we make big ones and we need to solve those mistakes and i'm glad he did
Hahahahahhahaha
You are the Man Will and i respect you God bless you and you have a great heart
that like/dislike to views ratio tho
Sadly if they become friends again they will never be able to high five the way they did before
this incident doesnt make him a bad man, dowsnt mkae him an infinite POS till the end of the universe. i guarantee will you remember this 20 years later? no. im not sayong hes a saint, but im not harping on him either. He apologized. whether u avvept it is up to you. but respevt the fact that he did. he didnt have to and couldve BEEN a pos for just staying silent forever.  people. make. mistakes. People expect perfection put of will. STOP. thats not fair to him and im sure chris doesnt want hate. Chris and will should resolve this privately.
Jada's puppet
straight from a text book lol
People make mistakes and emotions can take over and cloud our judgment.
Take it a day at a time Uncle Will. None of us is perfect. We all have skeletons in our closet, the world was just able to see one of yours. Thank you for being you big homie!
Well you tried
seems like a pretty genuine apology
Hopefully he doesn't put this under the rug like David dobrik did.
Too little and MUCH TOO LATE!
Too late?
I forgive you, Will.
My thoughts towards Will is like a father. There will be a time when he is forgiven but right now words really aren't the answer. The hard reality is that Will will never be given the same status in the pack again. Trust is sometimes not something that you can earn back.
This is so pathetic on so many levels. This man is absolutely incapable of standing up for himself. So sad to see a man who has been THE man my whole life (while being a good guy!!!) being reduced to such an embarrassing low by some wretched old lady who isn’t even worth his pinky finger 😞
It's a trap lol he says Chris come over SUPRISE will has been training MMA 6 months. Chris you see this avoid Will.
Will, we still love you man, we're still your fans, and yeah you are just human and you do make mistakes and admitting and working to make amends is the only way to go friend. We as fans love and support you so much. Can't wait to see you get back to work and see future projects come up, but take your time and get yourself centered again. We'll be waiting for you, Will.
Too little, too late. I've lost all respect for you Mr Smith.
The second I heard Will Smith sigh I knew I was in for a ride
ouch!!! 42,000 dislikes!
I know he is probably trying but what he did was disapointing, he has children what kind of example is that? I can't believe he even thought about doing that with his title and his kids watching.
🤓
hope you're doin alright
Sir it’s not that serious
Was that Olivia Pope I saw in the background? Nice try though! And how shameful to try to hawk your book after the fake [Staged] apology! 🤔
title: its been a minute me: its been 4 months  (i know it means a while in slang but still)
Jared Leto (Morbius) should have gotten the best actor award, not Smith.
Damn, 42k dislikes
ok
work on your personality Smith it's unbelievable that you did such a foolish mistake .. you were such a role model to us and now am just disappointed , work and work hard !
I don't get why he apologized it's been 4 months and everyone had just forgotten I don't get why he couldn't just handle this privately
They have to let this go you apologized more than enough and we all know that you are a good kind-hearted person so out of all of us I say we love you and we still support you no matter what and the good and the bad this is why God brought us in this world to forgive and forget
The thing is You should be ashame of yourself, you should be punished and you should pay for this. this apology does not mean you should be free of any of  these above.
This is still unacceptable
proud of you for doing this and doing better and trying to reconcile with chris
Love you, Will. I feel for Chris’ family and your family. I hope they all can recover from this incident, including you.
I find it funny how this was majority liked until it got into the media, now it's flooded with dislikes LMAOOOO this internet war never gets old!
Go be Rich over somewhere else other then YouTube.
Yeah no inexcusable. Move on, also this coming too late.
I would like to see all the executives in the behind the camera
I love this man.  I’m glad he took accountability and apologized on a public platform since the offense took place on a public platform.  I hope they can find the space to hash it out and  move past this at some point.
yes
If his not divorcing his partner, he hasn't grown. It feels like a toxic relationship, nice guys with a toxic relations come out at the bottom. And its the worse sort of bottom.
Obunga
You have already apologized to Chris and I hope he comes back. If not then it's fine. People are not perfect. Live life and do greater things you will be okay.
Beta 🤣
Hmm. At least the apology happened
Still a punk mood
I dunno, this whole video seems staged. Maybe Will is speaking from the heart, but the room screams stage and im not so sure i personally believe this was Will speaking from the heart because of the way the whole room looked set up to go along with the theme of forgiveness.  With that said, im personally over it. Will did let me down, I would say i was a huge fan, probably won't be a huge fan of him going forward, but ill still support projects he is in if im interested in said project.  One thing i will say is that this whole incident has kinda opened my eyes to Hollywood thinking they are elites and can get away with anything. No wonder monsters like Harvey Weinstien thrived in Hollywood.
yahhhh it's rewind time
bruh who cares.
When can we vote for you as President?
I’m so upset that the world made him feel like this was the most terrible thing to do in the world. None of what happened was ever that serious for this type of attention. Understandingly, it may not have been the right thing to do, however, it didn’t need an entire groveling YouTube video
I Will forgive you
L
He did the sigh
It’s been a while but he apologized at least I guess but way too late.
Rude to wear a hat indoor
I’m not really invested in whether he’s a good guy or not but as far as apology videos go it comes across fairly organic and not fake or saying sorry for the sake of his reputation but because he is actually sorry, that said who truly knows
Blah blah that’s all I got from this
I forgive you will.
Ok Will, but can we talk about the political and economic state of the world right now?
I love this man
When asked what you have to say to those you've let down...Noone wants to hear how you were traumitized Will. I'm sure that's true, but that's for you to explore with your therapist (but if you're I scientologist you don't believe in therapy). What you say is: Yes, you are right, I really messed up, and I'm in therapy now trying to sort out what happened so I won't act like an a-hole in the future.
Can someone tell me how many dislikes there are?
You tell em Big Willy!
🤡
Lost all respect for this man!!
hard to tell if he’s being genuine or he’s just a really good actor
At 2:00  Bravo to the staging crew the room looks so zen! Y’all see the family photos? The framed picture on the wall The World is Sick Love is the CURE (subtle right?)  Bravo to the production, editors writers… erbody gets a gold star. And Will gets another nomination for a stellar performance. Misty eyes and cracking voice.   Come on now y’all he said “sorry”
You are human and as a human, you are allowed to make mistakes. Your actions were surprising, but not disappointing. You are a Father, a Husband, a Son, a Friend and role model to millions - You let us all know with all that you are also a man. You true fans will tell you from us?  That there is nothing to forgive. You and Chris will have your moment. But for the millions who have supported you from the Album til now, we have nothing but love for you Will. You still have the ability to inspire, to encourage, to help others dream. I thank you for everything. I wish well.
I'm so proud of you Will for taking time to heal. I understood in that moment you we're a spiritual soul having a Human experience.
the way that people as a literally nobody commented. "i forgive you Will", dude r u Chris or somethin? 🙄
"THANKS YALL" BUY MY BOOK NOW🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly, everyone makes mistakes. I'm not here to forgive like many of the comments, I wasn't hurt in anyway from wills actions. I do want to say though that I hope you don't get to depressed over this. It was a big mistake, yes, but you've done an insane amount of good. Just because you're in the spotlight as a celebrity doesn't mean you have to be better than everyone else.
This you???- 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
In the entire video, I didn't hear "I'm sorry Chris" once. He apologized to everyone else, but the guy who deserved the apology.  Just a bit weird to me.
This is a great apology and example to learn from.
Wow he got real af. He’s still a punk for what he did!
This dirty laundry stinks.
See that's the thing Will, I would totally believe you if had a reaction of regret and shame afterwards. But no, you kept on with the night as if nothing happened.
he reads like a robot
Will you’re good bro you are one of my favorite actor’s what you did was wrong but I forgive you
Bruh
Why did he wait 4 months and 2 days to apologize though lol?
Here's your dislike button  👎
Now apologize for wild wild west
Nice shirt. Anyone know the brand?
Only in America can we  live in a reality  where this dude is an icon  and this video is real.
“Disappointing people is my central trauma” that phrase really resonates with me. I’m glad you said something to address the scenario after you’ve had time to reflect. I know there is still a lot to reflect on, but it’s all baby steps. As far as forgiveness, it was never about us, it’s always been about Chris. Whatever happens there I respect his decision. Time heals some things, but not all.
You cant lie will it was funny
people 's reaction to this incident  is veeery veeery  different , in Japan and in US..  in Japan , majority of people are defending what Will Smith did to him. and People think Chris did a mistake.   In Japan, maybe,  one's honor and justice  is slightly more important than actual legal things ..
Being sorry means nothing. You should have been more mature then. Be better now. Improve for the future.

Love you so much Will
CUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Love you so much Will.
Don’t worry will, I was never disappointed in you, I knew you had a reason for what you did! It was wrong place at the wrong time but your only human and humans react! I’m still a HUGE fan!!! :)
wow
Will if she is pointing a gun at you blink fast 3 times! We got your back brother!
We dont care. Its the ego for me.
Inaceptable la decadencia del Príncipe de bell air
Another meme template?
There's always second chance, man.
This gonna be a meme.......               ..........oh wait is already a meme :|
Dear people in the comments:  nobody cares if YOU for give Will Smith.  No matter if you accept will’s apology or if you don’t, it doesn’t matter.  Chris rocks opinion is the only opinion that matters in this situation
Will, take care of yourself. You did YOU wrong that night. Only you know what got you there. You don't have to climb out alone though. Get help homie. Whatever type you need.
King !!!!
This was funny to watch through. He sounded funny talking through this
we love u will
lmao
This is some top tier acting Will, hands down
is it just me or does the way he talks is weired? as if he's reading a script or something  (Not saying he is but I'm just saying that the way he talks is really off for an apology video)
If I did that I'd go to jail.  No justice.... no forgiveness.
🙌🙌🙌🙌❤️❤️👍
Now when will Chris take some accountability? I have yet to hear an apology from him because it’s definitely not all on will. I don’t care what you high and mighty people say.
WOW. Bro made a typical Youtuber apology with only 4 months of training
Beta!
Looked pretty fuzzy at the after party too, seemed to be incredibly upset.
Technoblade death got more views then famous  celebritie in the world
Choose how many times he say “uhmmm” | | | V
I forgive you will
Should of never happened in the first place.
I did this now because you are afraid of your manager and filming production companies did not agree to complete it because they will put their money in your films and you will lose a lot of money because of what you did for this reason you are at this moment apologizing .this should have been done before and not because this means you do This is for your own good, not for Chris
Very rehearsed. Very polished. Does not seem genuine. And the specifically placed picture hanging about love. Just too fake.
this was unlike him and totally out of character. everyones allowed to make at least one mistake geezus
Hes so lucky there no dislike count... the dislikes has to be insane
Honestly, i believe this was will’s wife’s fault. will didn’t want too i think.
lmao
You made a mistake, now it's up to Chris to decide to apologize to you.
I didn’t like what happened that night. And I wanna see you and Chris and everyone around you that was adversely affected doing better and being happy. Much love, strength and respect from yours truly.
You shouldn't do this publicly....send a genuine letter,wait a year....and never expect his forgiveness, please don't victimize him again, he's never going to want your friendship-because what you did is an expression of your true self ,he's already forgiven you brother now you need to leave him alone,we all can't be true brothers from the heart ,like they say if you love him let him be....so sorry Will to be so harsh, but this the advice I would give to my beloved son,and I love you both
사과할 게 아닌데 참나
fortnite
I don’t think Will is a bad person. I think he made a bad choice. He did something in that situation that we all instinctively want to do but we should never act on. Most importantly I hope Chris is okay and is able to heal
Our economy is tanking, i might never be able to afford a house. My life is probably gunna suck. But im lad this is in the news. I feel much better. Thanks will 🙄
What is going on here.  🫣
I wonder how you can tell when guys like him, who are extremely high level actors, are genuine..
Man why’d YouTube have to get rid of dislikes
To reflect on Your EFF up and Own it!!! is all that needs to be considered  may Have cost yo a star on the walk of Fame But your a Bigger Man for admitting your Faults and that during the heat of the moment...it got the better of you  ...still hold respect for you
Sorry. Don’t buy any of the ‘sincerity’. This is totally ‘damage control’ for a career headed to the dumps. His PR put him up to this and probably wrote the ‘response’ word for word.   Nice try.  I will not be supporting any more movies, music, etc.
WE  FORGIVE YOU
go on Will, pull a Chris Benoit, only then we'll forgive you
Meanwhile Ezra is playing gta in real life
this also took too long man just fn say u sorry  glad u aint no role model
c'mon will, not trying to be negative but damn i'll never look at you the same. best of luck🤍
Nope……
This is a good start. Making amends and admitting shortcomings is not easy, but its the mature thing to do even if others don’t feel accepting. It’s still necessary. Give everyone time. Thank you for stepping up, even late. It means alot. It will mean a lot. Cant rush others to accept- they deserve the time to weigh your meaning but well done, Mr Smith.  And sorry has to be sufficient. We are all human and apolozing is the humane thing to do. Thats all.
"I should have apologized at my acceptance speech and I didn't. I am sorry for showing up that way, I am sorry that my choices upset you Chris, your family and your friends / fans."  That's all Will. That is an apology. Not "fog" not "I am here".  "I am sorry, I would like to create the possibly of my speaking to you Chris and I will be here if you should decide that is something you would like and if you don't, I understand that too."
W will
Wow it only took 120+ days for the man to apologize. Really impressive, very humbling.
Bruh
Wait this is the guy who solved 2+2=4?
Grown man and did that bs…If im Chris, it’s nothing to talk about. I don’t want to be your damn “friend again”. Keep it moving. Personally I would have dragged you across that stage but that’s just me.
Ya know. While I thought it was bullshit what you did. You hurt quest possibly more than Chris. It just went to show me that even someone I look up to this much makes giant mistakes too. For someone that I’ve listened to so intently over the years. I wasn’t like mad. Bc that’s Chris’s call to make. I honestly was disappointed but at the same time after listening to you for such a long time and looking up to you. I knew there had to be something much more going in
Even though he apologized, his career will never be the same. He's about to go down a rocky road. (Yes, puns were intended.)
I hope his career never recovers.
m
what a stain on humanity
Well, he did it
No one can undo what’s already been done, we can only move forward, do our best and hope for the best.  Praying for healing for both parties.
We love u
but you should be ashamed.
Don’t believe it!!!!!! Seems like he just wants his career back and his tik tok reels. Had he been sorry he apologizes that night and does not party after the show like he did. He’s just sorry because people didn’t take his side.
I was and still am so disappointed. Not because I hold you up to any standards, but because honestly I feel you still don’t fully understand why you did that. It’s disturbing.
Idek who hes apologizing to.... he didnt say sorry to chris, and thats the only person affected, the only person.
The way he said he apologizes was as hard on him as it would be for Hancock to say “good job”
Hey man, we all have our weak moments. Jesus forgived me, I'm in no place to hold this against you especially after seeing how remorseful you are. To the future!
39.687 DISLIKES  7/29/2022
Good talk Will.
You are now a professional youtube apologist, so proud of you.
Millions in the bank. Who gives two fuxk what anyone thinks.... 🤷‍♂️
it took ya 4 months to come up with this pathetic attempt to regain some respect? really dude??
We all deserve forgiveness but have to prove ourselves once again
Bruh
Too little too late. Because ofc he's posting this online
Lol
famous people and rich people are so entertaining
Mate, you're pushing 60. How much more time do you need to 'learn' and 'grow'?
Love you Will, keep your head up ❤️
❤❤
Apologies accepted ✅🙏🏾✨💎
"It's been a minute" nah it's been a few months
At least he had the guts to say he sorry! He's human. Ask yourself the question. Do you recall of doing something so bad that you've been ostracized, can't forgive yourself etc? Keep moving Will! That's all you can do at this point! FORGIVE YOURSELF!
Is that ball of light behind his head supposed to represent a halo?  If so, it’s not working.
What about the william sisters??
apologizes, proceeds to answer questions like reviewing a movie scene…am i the only one looking at it from this perspective? this should only be an apology
You can't change what you have done. Just be a better man Will.
Why now ?
39k dislikes as of now if anyone was wondering - EDIT: 171k dislikes - EDIT: 219k dislikes-- 260k dislikes
“while you’re here shop the will smith store !!”

@willsmith You apologized and took accountability as a man, father, friend and professional. Keep your head up and move on.💪🏿💯❤
Te admiré antes, te admiro ahora y te he de admirar siempre, no por tus errores si no por tu gran corazón y tu grandeza, tienes una personalidad única y no debes de permitir que un error afecte permanentemente tu vida. Saludos y abrazos. Bucaramanga, Colombia.

The good that you have gave and shared out weigh that experience you had! Embrace the future continue to be your best!!!
_AND I'd like to take a minute Just sit_ _right there_ , hey did us humanity literally forget how we slay at *sinning* ?! Yep that pretty much means there's NO 1 winning! - I'll tell you how to leave a Man called WiLL ..some *AIR*  .
I pray you give your life to Jesus Christ Will ..! He loves you sooooo much
I don't remember Will mentioning Chris at all. Like, honestly that is who you should target the video to.
Tone deaf and ingenuine , sorry this bridge can't be mended. You were an idol of mine will, and this is too little too late.
I respect the informality of this. I kinda wish it wasn't like a production though with the multiple camera angles. It makes it feel kind of staged. I feel your words are true though.
not to be rude but I cant tell if hes gonna bust out laughing or start crying
I got a lump in my throat. I've looked up to Will as a big brother. It's like watching my beloved blood brother going to jail for a lapse in judgement when normally he is wise and calculated. I want the best for you, Will, and I hope you rise out of this like a Phoenix, more brilliant than your former self.
You still did it get. GG
this was... awkward.
I’m so freaking confused I never watch stuff like this
This is so weird
I’ve made a severe and continuous lapse of my judgement
On May I bough four copy of your book. One for each member of my family. It was so impactful. It showed to me that , as Charles Chaplin said, …”All of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else”. We keep learning our whole life, improving , forgiving, loving and erring
It takes courage and integrity to completely own a mistake and make a sincere apology. You neither made excuses nor blamed anyone else for anything. No matter how things turn out, you can hold your head up knowing you did your best to make things right.
This situation got my feelings really messed up because I’ve been a much bigger fan of you Will and watched everything you put out. You’ve been such a good male role model to what a good man looks like, but I cannot help but feeling a lot more towards Chris in this situation. Chris could be banking so much money right now, doing appearances, book deals, shows, etc… from this terrible experience. He has done nothing and spoke to rarely anyone about this topic in public. Not drawing any attention to it and his reaction and actions towards something so hurtful is being handle like such a first class human being that makes me feel pain and hurt for what was done to him and how he must be feeling about it. This is just still so sad months later to think about the moment and I hope, they both find a way to heal themselves and together from the experience and I hope to see some positivity, resolution and a bright light at the end of the tunnel. This sucks!
Very well thought out and genuine apology by Will here imo. Much love to Chris. I hope Will gets his chance to reconcile with him and his family
Lmaooo
Probably the best apology i have ever heard
Just seems like a PR thing. Yea maybe homie feels bad about it. But he should have been making it right to Chris afterwards. He didn't look too remorseful at the after party which speaks volumes to me.   Everyone messes up. But he could have made it right way sooner.
❤️❤️❤️
No regular person would ever get three full months to process anything
Ben?
Not good enough tbh
Amogus
He owned it, he apologized, and hes dedicated to improving. It's great to see so much positivity in the comments bc i feel like standing by him is the right call. Will Smith is so much better than that one moment, we all know it, lets give him a chance to prove it. Will: this mistake does not define you! We still love you. Much respect.
lmao that like to dislike ratio
Way better than any youtube apology tbh
Does'nt appear to be sincere to me.. of course I could be wrong but it appeared like he was reading a script and trying to remember some of the words..
As humans, we make mistakes. We are imperfect and don’t always make good, rational decisions on how to act, or react, best in a given situation. The true test of a person who wants to be a good person and grow as a human is someone who can realize their mistakes, realize how their mistakes hurt or affected others, apologize and use that experience to help them make better decisions in the future. Will seems genuinely remorseful for his behavior and I think it shows that he is a human committed to being better and affecting the world in the most positive way he can.
Damn, a nice set for apologizing.
Classic apology youtuber video technique
Let the games begin
Man apologized 3 months later 🫤
Bruh
"Don't recommend this channel"
you are not sorry.  this is your attitude
I'm aware that it is up to Chris to forgive Will, though, I do forgive him. I feel horrible for both of them; Will and Chris.
I see you, Will. I'm holding space.
Who cares tons of dudes would’ve done the same thing.
Good for you.
Common Will L
"I'm sorry Chris."  Looks down, Oh yeah, buy his book from the Will Smith Store.  "Thanx y'all"
I've always loved you and will continue to. No one is perfect and I hope you are finding peace and continue to move forward. 🕉❤❤❤
Ayy man save yourself get a divorce and get out bro your a Great actor dude
Took a long time to apologize aye?
Was that Olivia Pope I saw in the background? Nice try though! And How shameful, to try to hawk your book, during this fake apology! 🤔
Shut up in the comments about you all forgiving this man , Although you might feel disappointed it’s not your place to forgive.   The entitlement these days is ridiculous bro , He made a mistake , we all have done far worse Im sure.
Our mental health is our only hope during these moments of darkness… and even the best and brightest among us might not be able to keep up
This video is a waste of time . " I made a mistake " ............are you sure ?
NAAAAAAAH
Glad Will apologized, for whatever reason.  What he did was honestly belittling and disrespectful to Chris. 😩😋💅🏽 they should box this beef out, me thinks.
oh no he did a booboo and didnt go to jail
Nothing is better than this. There is no other better way this could have been done. You're free, Will!
Inadequate self-control no I'm not satisfied. It took some stones to stand up there and do this video no not enough
What about the 3 female hosts? No apology for ruining their experience? What about the woman who won best actor? I have no idea who won because everything was overshadowed by your ego. I loved you Will and I still do but I’m so disappointed man.
Amy Schumer watching probably thinking "Where's my apology?"
Another common Smith L sadly.
I do not forgive you
That's how you do it! Forget everybody else's opinion- As long as you and Chris are descent enough to come together and agree, that's all good! Both of you are intelligent respected strong-willed men, keep it that way. Blessings to you both!
You know what man I really respected you but after losing your cool like that it broke something that can't be repaired. You should be suffering because of disappointing people we will forgive but you have changed the way people perceive you. Best of luck
You're coming back from this the same way Alec Baldwin is making westerns.
I'm still not subscribing. we need a mib 4. Aladdin 2
How DARE YOU ! Taking Beyoncé 👑🍯moment for your apology .. #Shame   Chris can  Forgive you but shady boots Mr.Smith 😒
I just hope a big PR machine isn't conducting the start of this operation, and that it's just one man beginning to sincerely learn from his failings.
Apology NOT accepted....
Well, time will tell. I like to watch your movies. Keep making good movies.
Will you may not see this, but please see the human in yourself. I think, at this point you are being too hard on yourself. You are healing and that’s OK. Keep inspiring ppl. We make mistakes - even the ppl judging you.
Time for more mass distraction.
glad to see you back will!!!
Lmao
Love You Dude!
This is going down as the worst apology on YouTube
"Good job". Cheers.
instead of saying all this bs, why not come clean and admit it was staged
Todos cometemos errores, somos seres humanos, lo que nos engrandece es poder enmendarlos y cortar de tajo ese error. Te queremos, Will.
Dude, you are a product of a narcissistic relationship. I know you think you're not,but you show every sign. Until you fix the route, it will be difficult to believe. However, Chris only knows how he feels, and all possible outcomes should be accepted humbly.  Kudos for the comedians giving Chris support against the extreme liberal Hollywood. The comedians are the only one's who expose the toxicity of that thinking. 👏🏽
For me, I can most definitely relate as I have made a lot bigger mistakes in life and I too am trying to teach myself that those mistakes don't define me as a person. We are all humans and WE ALL make mistakes. That's why erasers where put on pencils... In my opinion, you are taking the right steps to rectify this mistake. You're using that eraser in the correct fashion, lol. I, for one, forgive you but I'm not the important one here that needs to forgive you. YOU are the one that needs to forgive yourself man. I know that your mistake is magnified because being famous and people are cruel and don't want to let you move on because its like entertainment for them but that's because they don't see you as a human being they see you as this unreal, bigger than life, object and not a human with emotions and feelings. Forgive yourself and keep it movin with the folks that won't do the same. Not that you don't care what they think or because they don't matter but because you have to. You have to for yourself and your family. Most people will be able to see if you're bullshiting or being sincere about the apology and I, for one feel like you are 100% sincere and for me that's what counts... P.S. Can't wait to see you back on top man and making movies!
Dang, that was the fastest 5mins video I ever watched.  I thought he talked about 2mins but dang, it went over quick.  I thought he will have more to say....but again it's too fast and thought there's three more minutes...left? If that make sense.
Hope he’s sincere
Too Late
🙏🙏
This feels more like the “acceptance speech”.  🖤
Felt real, it will all go away once him and Chris talk eventually.
I love you, Willard. 🙏🏽💜🌈
Baby boy.... you are human. Not a super hero. We get it. We all do the best we can. No one is perfect.  I love you. You bring me joy.  Thank you. You will be ok.
☹
😆
Drama.
15 seconds in and we got the “YouTube apology” sigh of sadness lol.
How about we make it an hour.
Lmfaooo bro leave that girl
“My memory was fogged…”  Boy, if you don’t get the FOH!  Yet you had the wherewithal to apologize to the academy in your acceptance speech and were “getting jiggy” with it at all the after parties!
It is true, we are all just human! It was not right to do, some thought they could understand the reaction! But it wasn't right then either! But we can only move forward, and learn of our mistakes! And pray for healing for everyone that was hurt! Also yourself! 🙏❤️
King Will!!!! No longer a prince
<3 good job
what a performance
Good on you Will! Keep it up! But I guess I will never see Will Smith the same way again.
Te admiré antes, te admiro ahora y te he de admirar siempre, no por tus errores si no por tu gran corazón y tu grandeza, tienes una personalidad única y no debes de permitir que un error afecte permanentemente tu vida. Saludos y abrazos. Bucaramanga, Colombia.
He should have just been real with us. He had beef with Chris and lost his entire f**king mind. I'd appreciate that alot more.
IT WAS A MISTAKE. LET THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS NEVER MADE ONE SPEAK UP!!!
I could care less about this. I'm just still pissed he turned down Neo for the Matrix. What were you thinking!?
Humble, honest and heartfelt! Much respect! ✊🏾
People are starting to forget and still he publish an apology video. And that his brave.
You "apologized" just like a celebrity or politician lmao..
Yeah, no. Months late and a dollar short. Should have apologized on-stage.
No one is perfect all the time.....we all are only human....
I'm glad we got to see who will really was all these years.........................
If Chris can forgive you, more power to you both. But let's not pretend this public apology 5 months later is foe Chris. You already said you reached out and he'll let you know when. So this video is really for the fans, so they can see a apology. So you can go back to making movies and not have people keep asking why you never apologized to Chris.  You must be getting ready to start making public appearances again. Which I'm fine with. But I can smell the PR a mile away with this one
It’s clear Chris triggered a primal response from a man who cares deeply about his family (if your family was being embarrassed or made fun of in front of millions of people think about how you’d react). Was it a refined and dignified response…. No because it was Primal… it was fight or flight… The guy has apologised, be great if that was the end of it. Will Smith, forgive yourself, post some more content and move forward.
Everybody makes mistakes. I read your book BEFORE all of this. I understand that NO ONE is perfect.
I tend to feel like the whole world is against me, couldn’t imagine it actually being a reality. We’re all human and we all make mistakes, owning it is what makes you stronger. The whole thing seemed out of character for you, I hope you find mental clarity.
❤️
This is sincere.  This man has had DECADES of being in the spotlight and giving nothing but love, positivity and laughter into our homes.  Will, I don’t know where your head was at, it’s unreal how one bad moment takes away so much good. Chris has been roasting and doing stand up for just as long, to take it personally won’t ever make any sense to anyone.   Thank you for the video. All the best, I’m still a fan for all those years of quality entertainment.
He was open and honest with the questions that people asked and he didn't cry or make it dramatic. Professional apology.
We love you Will Smith. You did what you needed to do as a husband and I respect that.  We forgive you
Did you dump the harlot, though?
Dear will...I was shocked as many of your fan...but the thing is , mistake is a part of being human...nobody is perfect but we are all constantly fighting to be better and compete to beat our previous version to be a better one...your honesty is easily seen and heard so please don't go so hard on yourself...
مرحبا بك عندي في الجزائر لتتنفس قليلا
Too little, too late
ITS OK WILL... WERE ALL MEN AND SOMETHING CLICKED IN YOU TO RESPOND THAT WAY..YOUR A GOOD MAN AND DONT THINK OTHERWISE
No matter what happened we All are always with you sir 😚🙏♥️ Love from India 🇮🇳❤️🙏
Will you are nothing close to a bad human & nothing close to perfect because you are human. As your profession, you truly are my favorite actor and will forever be that to me and others I am sure of it. Pursuit of Happiness is my favorite movie along with 7 Pounds. You know how to connect with others and this one mistake does not blur your imagine. Learn & move on Will, most of us have already.
So ur apology only comes because “you let people down”?? Not because u were a jerk and in need of anger management classes, as well as ur children whom supported ur action. Shame on you!!
Yo don’t do this next time bye ✋🏾
Everyone makes mistakes will. Keep working on yourself king.
I've read your autobiography Will-- and I know that what you said in the video is from your heart and it's not the actor in you. I know that you have mulled it over .. from what I read in your book, you do a lot of soul searching ..   A minute of madness-- hope this does not define you because you've done some amazing things in your life.   (for those reading this, don't comment on what I said... I wrote this for Will)

Best YouTube apology video ever made
Nobody died, lucky he didn't have a concealed carry license, blam blam.
Russell Westbrook : Whaaaaat?! Y'all niggas crazy
Will, It took courage for you to come forward and make an apology to those involved, as well as, anyone else you hurt. This is the first step towards the path to peace. Many people wouldn’t apologize bc their ego and pride would’ve held them back. So, I appreciate that you did so. Secondly, we all are imperfect and make rash decisions at time when a situation is highly charged. We let our emotions get the best of us and do things we regret. No one can say they’ve not done so. Even Peter, one of Jesus’s closest disciples was guilty of this and Jesus forgave him. And, Peter denied him 3 times. So, if Jesus can forgive Peter who are we to not forgive someone else whose imperfect as we are. Despite, your misjudgment and mistake I have not looked at you differently. I still think you’re a good person and I enjoy your personality and talents. Keep doing the work you need to do for yourself. Don’t beat yourself up too much. Give yourself some grace bc Jehovah God forgives in a big way and is merciful. You’re not a bad person; you just made a rash decision. Keep your head up brother. Many people still love you and ride with you. 🥰🤗
proud of you. you did well to apologize and you will grow even more as a man and as a human being after this bad mistake and this bad fall. I love you will.

I'm probably gonna be called inappropriate for this but this "explanation" (unsure of the format he's going for) uuuummmm....his delivery of it comes off rather wooden and feels a bit forced or maybe a bit disingenuous like he HAD to put something out there. What the hell does he mean by "I'm TRYING to be remorseful while not being ashamed of what happened?" It's like he started with a forced apology then back pedaled ever so slightly a little bit with a non-apology apology which is the equivalent of saying something like, "Mistakes were made that day" It was kinda uncomfortable watching this....
Pettyupaldaway
Sorry Babe? 😂😂😂😂
Pettyupaldaway
The whole "apology " sounds like bullshit
L
This was legit and genuine. Time to move on now for everyone. It was wrong and he deserved the backlash but it's not the biggest thing in the world, people need to learn to move past stuff!
W Will
Months and months later he conveniently makes this apology while trying to get some Hollywood projects down the pipeline. If people are willing to pay money to see his acts, then good for him. I know that I definitely will not be one of those people. As far as I am concerned he is still a POS and should always be remembered as so.
Hey Will, honestly I think your fans just want to know how you are doing. If you’re ok. Your mental health is also so important and I hope your able to be at peace. You deserve that. 🙏
This doesn't feel like a sincere apology to Chris...Clearly just a PR move to improve his ratings. I hope Chris recovers from the emotional torment of having to deal with the psychological after effects of this incident which will take years to recover from ...none of that was ever mentioned in this video... Will is still just as self righteous and approval seeking as ever, nothing has changed
Like pops said on Friday ...  Sometimes you lose some sometimes you win some but....we live to fight another day.... so get back in the fight  and trying again it always a better way to make a Great come back I know you know what I mean Will you got our support we need you in this world 🌍💯🙌🏿🙏🏿
People are still upset with the guy over something that was never really a big deal.  People need to go ahead and move on a quit acting like they’re above this guy or that he did the worst thing he could have done just because, for once, people feel like they have power over a guy that they saw as having this infinite source of power over them, society, and everyone and everything else.    People just want to feel like they’re finally above one of the most famous and (once) most well-respected people in the world for as long as possible because they have no power over anyone and anything else.  It’s like a dream come true for people to feel this much better than this guy and like they control him and chases after their approval.
amen brother.
Will: You guys asked a lot of good questions  Will: Proceeds to answer about two questions
I already forgave you since Day 1, Will. What happened didn't change my view on you or Chris. I still look up to you because as you said, we are all human, we all make mistakes and I know it's going to take time before the world can forgive you entirely but know that you have those like me who still look up to you, support you, enjoy your performances and would be honored to be your friend. I for one would be honored to get to work on a movie with you when I become an animator someday. You were a part of my childhood since Men in Black, and no matter what happens, you won't face the issues you are dealing with about the situation alone. Me and many others with you every step of the way, Will. You are a good man with talent and love.
Oh my God I feel his pain. It was tough but I saw the whole thing.
I hope you are okay... Stay strong! Will❤️❤️❤️
Big Will in time you find the way to forgive this whole ugly incident....but what would Capt Howard say! Continue to take as much time as need brother, its only right when Chris and you talk the moment gone be right-y'all brothers so hash it out and bury it and from that point on support each other like never before, be stronger for one another as well, never to forget but be a blessing its way more then a apology. #Loveyabrother
Time will tell.....
I am not sure how you are feeling, but, after listening to you talk, it seems you are not happy or able to feel happy, and my only wish for you is that as you try to do better and try to make better decisions in the future that you will be able to regain your happiness. Please do all you can so we can say we are proud of you.
Too little too late bro, how does it take you this long to make this video. I think we all know the real reason this apology is being given is that the situation is still hurting you financially. If you truly thought it was wrong you would have apologized right away instead of sitting through the whole show without acknowledging it.
Wouldve been a different story if will smith was white........hollywood Hypocrisy
So after all of this time, a sincere apology. I am sure it comes since most all offers of work have ended and nobody wants to work with him. An early retirement is a good thing after the incident.
It's not for us to even comment about this. That's between him and Chris. I just hope they BOTH learned a lot from this and heal. I am sending love and light to both of you because it's so much going on in this world. We need to love on one another.  Emit the love frequency!!! One more thing...Will you do NOT  have to validate anyone but yourself!!!  Continue to heal my brother!!!!
Sending love
I feel sorry for Will Smith...
no matter what he does his reputation has been permanently damaged
You’re good bro it happens 💯
He's an actor doing what he does best. Acting. #notgenuine
Men do bad things when they act while under pressure. But as a distinguished actor I would expect you to hold yourself up to a higher standard. That being said, people have done worse, and coming out and admitting your fault is a very mature thing to do. I grew up watching Bad Boys and Men In Black. I appreciate you for you’re extreme talent. At the end of the day though, we as fans shouldn’t be the ones to say if we forgive you or not. It’s up to Chris.
Didn’t really address anything other than what I expected… very surface level
Come out as gay already
Wasn’t even an apology, man just tried to rationalize everything he did
You seem like an abused man, and so am I.  Look, there's nothing wrong with being abused, by a man or woman.  And there's a good woman for you.  I don't hate you, just what you did.  I hope you fond it in yourself to leave an abusive relationship
It takes courage to do what you did. It isn't up to us to judge you. You did it, you owned and importantly you learned from it! Now cheer up!
I do not know you personally. I do not know what you go through on a daily basis. People are very quick to make judgements we know nothing about. I do know, you are a person in the public eye and therefore, people think they have a right to comment on Everything you say or do. You deserve Peace, you deserve Love, you deserve forgiveness. We all make missteps, all. Let the people who have never made any mistakes or missteps judge.... You, Will, will have no accusers then.  Peace is Yours ...Take It My Brother
9h 👉 views 1.3 M ,A real desire to wait for an apology and an explanation
That smug expression when he walked off stage after the slab is the true Will Smith. This apology is just a choreographed pr stunt
forgiveness is the answer.
7/10 better than some apologies, but not really convincing
Too busy rolling my eyes to actually continue listening to this self-absorbed so-called “apology” that spewed insincerity from the very start.🙄
You will come back from this. ❤
Rule #1 of the internet, don't apologise. It ain't worth it, let the internet run it's week long drama march and apologise in private. Dude I forgot it even happened and I can imagine I'm not alone
Zenu loves you king ❤
If his jobs keep coming, you won't see him apology. Damage control comes too late.😂
Thanks, Will. I am happy you are doing the work, and for all your apologies. I will speak for myself. I am still a fan. My concern was for Chris and your mental health. Take care.
Don't forget to forgive yourself. Much love!
i kinda looked up to him too, but im not sure if i will ever be able to understand his extremely arrogant walk on the stage. i really wonder what was going on in his mind at this specific moment. sorry, but i dont feel sorry for him. i‘d never do that in my life, even if i was an emperor
lol i forgot about this
I know I am insignificant in the big picture here. And I know Will is human. But I felt so much hurt and I really had to figure that out. Because I don't know this guy and he doesn't know me. So why???? And I think it comes down to the decline in our society. We have lost so much. The world can be such a cruel place. Will was the guy I could listen to with my kids. My reminder of my own childhood. His music got me through becoming a single Mom when I left my abusive ex, and put my 911 feelings to music.  A representation of a kinder, gentler world. So when this occurred, it was as though nothing outside my door was good. He changed too. And it hurt. However unfair that may be to that guy I don't know. ☺️  So I hope he can turn this into a positive and I hope he continues to put that love out into the world.   Thanks for reading my crazy thoughts and letting me share them. Peace and love to all of you. xoxo
Not trying to be negative but let's be real she didn't have to tell you anything, that look alone you know what it means smh you went to Dubai after bro come on you don't care at all lol you only care cuz your deals are going south.
As genuine as Donald Trump promising the wall.
Time to go to PewDiePie's "how to do an apology video" video. Although I've gotta say, this one looks pretty good.
Recorded horizontally:)
Why did the apology need to be a video posted for the public is able to see? Will Smith stays being one of the fakest people in Hollywood and in entertainment.
When you did what you did i was not only emotionally hurt but physically. You were one of the few stars who i thought was a truly loved,   gifted, and loving good person. I mean i put you right up there with John Wayne. I was completely mind fooked and mad as hell you could do such a thing to my idea of what a good person you were. I waited to see if the true man you are came out and apologized but you did not and i was hurt even more. I am so happy and proud of you and now my disappointment in you is gone and i can love you as a good man, father, husband, actor, and singer. I know you are an exceptional person, and you need to live up to that. You're a good person Will and we love you and the happiness you bring us. Please do not let us down again. I am glad i can watch your movies and listen to your music again and enjoy the happiness you bring into our lives. Always remember what would Jesuses do when presented with a proposition of sin... Love you Brother, be good....
Wtf 😭😂😂😂😂
Will Smith is successfull, rich, has a family and still can't figure himself out. He has all the tools to become a man,but he doesn't know how to use them. He's still a child.
I wouldn’t let that slide tbh but you know that’s just me 🤷‍♂️
Uncle phil what had he done in his place
Will made a mistake like we all do. He is here holding his hands up and acknowledging his error to Chris and to the world. For those who are unforgiving please remember the mistakes that you have done to others in the past, yesterday and today. Ye who without sin cast the first stone!!!!!
Shame is a part of remorse. What you did was completely shameful and you need to understand that shame to truly move forward.  You let down a large percent of your fans on multiple levels. What it means to be a man, what it means to be a man of color, what it means to be a person of virtue. We all make mistakes but allowing yourself to harm another person over some words, that type of behavior that should never be excused.
Don’t talk to us about it apologizing to Chris not our business
Ya di mi dislike sin siquiera verlo, ❤️
Society needs to learn to forgive after a genuine apology
4 months later. Hollywood
💕💕
I’m most disappointed that you let someone treat you like that. Your partner is supposed to help you be your best self. Not try to ruin your life over and over again.
This is hard to watch. Obviously an abusive relationship and a broken man. Between this and the amber heard Johnny drop case are we done? This is getting gross. We don’t need to know this.
Took you long enough will
Well this was late
'Better late than never'? ...OR ...'Too little too late'? ...what do y'all think??? ...personally I think his apology to everyone else was STILL much more genuine than what he expresses to Chris! ...WHY is it so hard or too much for you, Will?
Common guys, I throw I chair over a dude one time, the day after it was all good between us. We live a hard time, and sometimes it happen that we loss control for few seconds or minutes, it can happen to everyone, and we should be more tolerant in those situations
All about yourself. This is laughable
Plz get lost forever. Never be in the medias.
$
We all make mistakes. It’s how you deal with it after the fact. If anyone wants to troll my comment, please use logic and rational in your feedback.
All the negative comments are funny to me because their opinion will neither make nor break Will Smith. But please, continue to feel important by judging something from the outside looking in.
The only person winning by doing this is Will Smith. Why even post this on social media to start with? His just trying to repair HIS image!  I grew up watching Will Smith movies, he was funny and entertaining, a good actor. But now days, just wow.. His a empty shell and a woke activist with a God complex. I say: Go Woke. Go BROKE. You never coming back Will. Never.
We've all made mistakes and had bad moments, I am certain I have.  Unfortunately this mistake was very public, so extra hard on both Will and Chris.  It is ultimately between them, hope for healing for both.  Peace.
It seems a lot of people don't accept this apology because you didn't give it quick enough...months ago....I am glad that you took the time to reflect on this and how it affected everyone
How would you rank this apology video compared to some of the great apology videos.
Why make it public 🤷 make it a more personal one on one convo with Chris, it ain't about us here. This is YOUR problem you gotta fix it like a man and not some social celebrity
This is more like crywolf apology cuz he's too desperate to regain back his career he destroyed in a single night 😪
But you should be ashamed of your behavior.  That's the only part that don't sit right with me...no Will, you are not a piece of S***, everybody makes mistakes but your behavior in that moment was in fact very shameful...maybe wrong choice of words...
Personally I never blamed,judged or criticized your move that night. It was a bad moment and you are just a human being. And you have the right to make mistakes like the rest of us.I hope you'll find soon the strength to put all this behind you and see you again on the silver screen.We miss you!!!
Not quite sure what your PR team is trying to achieve with this but you have lot of issues to solve and one of them is work in your divorce
I’ve watched and rewatched this, I know what it is that bothers me about, why I don’t believe a word you’re saying, your words don’t match your expressions , you look angry still, I don’t know if it was forced  on you to make this video, anyone that doubts it, watch the video without sound and you just don’t get the humbleness and apology he’s trying to transmit, I see anger, on your eyes, your chin is defiant , almost like you’re reprimanding us that you have to do this, you show your teeth like a wolf (anger), your hand mannerisms are defensive…you wear all white, those words on the wall, all tactic, is dishonest and you don’t mean it…I call bluff…better to have kept quiet 🤐 🤫 …I said what I said, lier🤷🏼‍♀️
It’s a clone
Oh brother
We with you Will
Fake af! He needs his job back🤣
Jesus said, Those of you without sin, cast the first stone.   We all have done things that we regret.  The only tihing we can do is:  do what we can do to fix the situation, apologize and  move forward to be the best person you can be.  God loves you and so do I.
Mike Tyson bit off Evander Holyfield's Ear off. Now they're friends. It's fine.
Come on man I'm waiting for you to play in I'm the legend 2
If he feels the same after Chris sues him into another era.  Apology accepted
It’s takes huge courage to admit you’re mistake to the world. We all make mistakes, yours happened to be made in front of millions of people. I know these past couple of months have been rough. I’m glad you’re in a better place. Hopefully you and Chris can work things out.
Better late than never. Proud of you. We all know who really fueled all this, and it isn’t you Will.
4 month x apologies x 2022 = Sussy baka? 🤔
I'm not a big Will Smith fan. I don't dislike him, I enjoy most of his work. He's uber talented. None of us really know the man or who he is. But one giant public mistake does not define who he is and his apology and commentary seemed genuine and heart felt. I think he needs support not judgement as he navigates this and whatever underlying issues precipitated his actions.  I'm rooting for him!
All is well big bro
Nothing says sincerity like a 3 camera photoshoot!
You have a fan here who saw good in that, Rocks hostings would not have been found in any memories without you. Don't try and please the masses, be you, you do you.
Will honey please please please work also on FORGIVING YOURSELF.! .  I love and admire you even more  🙏🙌 and I send YOU lots of light and love 🙌🙏💞
You’re awesome Will. Everyone makes mistakes and nobody is perfect, we are all very flawed, good luck in the future.
Lol. He is a super emotional guy. One of the most dangerous types. Little impulsive control.
Will que falta faz nas telas te amo ❤️
Eh. Just another rich celeb stealing the limelight for himself. If he's really ashamed, he would retire from public life and save everyone the irritation of seeing him promote a mediocre projects every few years.
te amamos Will! fique bem 💜🇧🇷
Forgive yes! But never forget! There are plenty of people in the world! You do NOT have to associate with all of them! Pick and choose who you associate with carefully! You are united with who you associate with! Choose carefully and be picky!
nobody is perfect and i've been a big fan of Will since the 80's and still am...
Stop smacking brothers lol
I love and worship you brother.. I summon all kinds of love and endure the happy moments you've had on me and my family
Will Smith should definitely be forgiven. He made a stupid mistake and this shouldn’t define his legacy forever. He’s faced enough hate for this and I’d say that’s punishment enough. People like AMBER HEARD don’t deserve redemption; she maliciously tried to ruin a man’s life and turn the world against him with false rape allegations…. To me, that’s just as bad as ACTUALLY raping someone. William can come back from this and he deserves to. That being said, this apology feels forced, disingenuous and  pretty scripted.
A better apology to everyone else, but to Chris, still not so much!
So it was real?
You ain’t do nothing wrong
Nahh.. he was seen in the afteparty dancing and having fun. This apology comes from the pressure social media is putting on him…
I do not feel you owed him an apology. More people need to defend their partner these days. More relationships might last.
It really feels good to see you back ❤️❤️,💃💃 thanks to God you are back.
This sounds like what you'd expect to hear from an eight-year-old when you make them apologize, and you press them to say more than "oops, sorry".
Nice seeing yeah give Chris time. Peace !
Hope your doing ok get some help..
Your always one of the good ones Will, you are always forgiven by me, hope all is well, God bless you and your family
I'll feel sick for commenting on this video but I can't help to ask: Why they prepared a multi-camera setup with stabilized pan movements for an apology?
It’s his wife’s fault
I felt that....I think in this moment he really means it...he lost the battle with his shadow and he has taken the time to truly reflect....
Three months for this apology?  Didn't take long for you to party after.  Feels like a brand rebuild effort more than anything.
♥️♥️♥️
You're not human. You're a Robot Remember?
Why don't you patiently rework the relationship with Chris in the real world like you mean it? Stuff like this on YouTube have no credibility.
$10 Jada's behind that camera with a gun
So this has nothing to do with the new movie role? 🤔 I'm not saying it does but it's hard to ignore the timing.
GO GET YOUR SHINE BOX
Despite what Will did I always said look at Will's character he's not that sort of person to lash out like that. He is human like everybody else I think the public should have cut him some slack instead of tearing him down. I hope he finds peace with himself. Love you, Will Smith 🫶🏾🤗❤️❤️
Perfect bro! Glad your back! Don’t stress it too much! Stay strong and blessed!
¿Pa qué o qué?
You'll be alright will 🙏
There is no need to make a staged video with different angles and script. It feels like you are acting (you are really good at that) and trying to convince us that you are sorry for what happened. The moment was there 4 months ago and you took a bad decision with the responsibility of a grown man. This is between you and Chris. Not with us
I mean sure part of it is Chris and his family forgiving you, but don't forget the other half of it is forgiving yourself. And know for a fact that we do, for as much as that means.
When I was Watching David letterman’s interview with will smith  and when will said he went to Peru and starting drinking ayahuasca for 2 years 14 times maybe he drunk some after the show
We have our own lives to live bud.  But glad you're trying to put yours on all of us 😂
This dude puts too much of his life out into the world lmao
Anybody else think this is a load of crap or is it just me?
You're not a piece of sh*t Will. We all make mistakes man it's okay <3 You are loved and I hope your relationship with Chris and his family can one day be replenished.
Everyone needs mercy just like God renews and gives us mercy everyday. Will you’re human and you are a good person. You made a mistake just like EVERYONE in this world makes mistakes, and you apologized and it was from your heart. I hear the sincerity in your voice and see it in your eyes, just like I did that night. Trouble won’t last always like it says in the Bible. So stay encouraged. Still a HUGE fan of Will Smith!!! #youareawinnerwillsmith
36k dislikes yikes
To all the people who never made a huge mistake they wish they could take back, good for you. To the rest of us humans,  may we all have the courage to face our flaws and mistakes and work to be better people.  Thank you Will for this video. Clearly you have had a tough time and your sincerity come through loud and clear. God bless.
I'll never watch any of his movies again.  Period.
A mistake is when you do something by accident. You don’t accidentally walk up to someone and brick them in the face. That’s not a mistake. You did that intentionally.
Good for you, Will!
you should be feel ashamed for it, and i'm glad you do, but at the same time i can kinda respect that you're willing to express to everyone that you are as ashamed as you should be, because at least that lets us know you are going to try to do better in the future
Still like this Man!
The heart of Jesus is forgiveness.  Will Smith fulfilled the necessary step of repentance and admission of the transgression.  All of us mere humans make mistakes but we can try to repair what we break and even achieve the Kingdom of God through our Lord.  A happy ending forever.
Maybe I'm talking (still) like a fan, but this feel pretty honest. Good for BW.
Will Smith seems like a good man. He messed up. We’ve all messed up. For most of us, it wasn’t on video for the world to see. This seems like a pretty heartfelt apology. I think we all need to accept it. Otherwise an apology means nothing and there’s no redemption for anyone. Hopefully it will open the door for a private conversation between Will and Chris.
Hey! I hope you all are having a great day / night! Jesus loves you! God bless!
thanks for posting, so it reminded me to unsub.
His apology is as fake as a Seven  Dollar Bill!
We understand will
This is what happens when your life is dissected by the world. So many look up to Will and this shows that we are humans and can all confess our wrongs and put effort into making ourselves better and moving forward as a better person ✌🏽❤️
Don't foreget, you are watching a commercial for HIS NEW BOOK! Never let a crisis go to waste! MONEY MONEY MONEY!
I've learn that in life making stupid mistakes was not in the menu, you can't just do something and then apologize.
Wow, how sincere...had to play at 2x speed cuz hes reading the script waaayy too slowly Like...ur an actor? Couldnt u have practiced a bit more
You spent 3 months seeing if your fame and fortune would sway all this in your favor and it didn’t, so now you come out to fix it. Any normal, rational, and level headed human being would have said sorry on the day, when the “fight or flight” senses lower. Not 3 months lol.
If any of us would of done that, it would finished with handcuffs on us.   So ,whatever willy.
Estamos com vc will smith ❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
Really sad moment for you guys. I find it interesting that Will says that he and Chris were friends, yet what happened still happened. I hope Chris is able to heal. Will looks like he's already taking the road to healing but I think Chris is so hurt that his friend did that to him in front of all those people, it's gonna take him some time for sure.
Will Smith apologizes to Chris Rock's mother in this VIDEO? If you felt so bad about hurting her, call her and apologize personally. This seems cowardly to me.
no do am again
Why?! Why did u do that Will? Why? You're my hero Will. Why would u do such stink? That was poop! U poop. U poop "actor"! Haha. Jk. You aren't my hero. You wack! Such an awkward video.
You're baaaack and I love you so much much more for IT. I knew you would awe WILL... ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Very hard to do this & it takes courage 👏 No one is perfect & we all make mistakes. People deserve a second chance especially if u feel remorseful for what u did & u apologize. We are all here for growth & continuous learning. Being a celebrity doesn't exclude you. Your human just like the rest of us.  Thank you for this video!🙌 Welcome back Will💜💫 I missed you!!🤗
Overlord Xenu will save you, don't worry Will. All hail Xenu!
Black people can't do anything these days without the media jumping on us how the hell we supposed to live when we got all the internet, tv and movies against us
I’m so disappointed in you Will
i feel ya Will i know u dont know me or remember me but i met you at my high school Lincoln High School In South Dallas Texas back when u 1st got your record deal when u was young u was extremely kind & talked to me for a minute in the hallway i will never forget it & that person i talked to that day was a good human being we all make mistakes lord knows ive done some horrible things doesnt mean im a horrible person. Time Will heal all wounds & remember this to shall pass. Stay Strong my brother & dont beat yourself up man ... PiKaHsSo Verbadelyck
Will Smith para sempre ❤️
Not worth watching.
I still love you will.....we are human and I People make mistakes it's okay
Nothing like an apology video while wearing your own merch
Respect ✊, Only great men have the courage to recognize their mistakes ( because we make mistakes and will continue making them) and saying it out loud , and taking the steps to fix them ,we need more people like you.You set an example
I think it's good that you to took the time to understand fully what happened and to heal yourself and that's good that you reached out - that's the first step. I respect that. I hope you're feeling better as well.
It’s a little too late to say sorry
It not up to us (the audience) to forgive him, because the one he hurt the most was Chris
Behaviour is always affected by the environment.
Unfortunately, this incident, the choice HE made at the time has consequences that he how has to live with. It actually doesn’t matter what his reasons, excuses, whatever he wants to call them, they have and will forever effect his career. HE made these choices, he now has to live with the consequences. I’m not sorry for him at all. It’s been said that he’s had this superior complex right from the Fresh Prince days, and it’s now all come to a head. I don’t believe there is remorse at all with this video, and if I was Chris, I wouldn’t accept his apology.
Think I don't know what you truely did, sincerely EL.
No one is perfect WILL is human so let it go 🧿🧿🧿🧿 good for u WILL ❤️🙏🏼
L
Still loving you Will
I wish we could see the dislikes 👎
Hey Will you want to play fortnite sometime?
Forgiving will isn't really that hard. He is the fresh prince of Bel-Air after all.
“I didn’t live up to people’s image and impression of me.” Well, if we are in this fixed idea of living up to people’s image and impression of us and constantly facing the imperfections of who we are, then the idea of living a meaningful life becomes vain. For we, be it the entertainers, etc., will never live for ourselves but for real or fake images of what people perceive of us. The first thing we admired, you realized that you made mistakes, but living up to people’s image of you would always be a strangling trauma that’s never fixed. Just live beyond what people might perceive of you.
Proud of u will 💫
Hey we are all flawed as human beings, we all make terrible mistakes where our anger or frustration takes over our mind for that brief moment, and sometimes it takes time for us to apologize which is what matters, hopefully Chris will forgive you and you guys can be friends again
The craziest thing about this whole thing… is how accurate the reporting was on the tabloids behalf. Wow… they nailed so many things.
Hi Will, I hope you are well. I hope that the light and joy starts first with you and yours <3. The rest of the world will definitely see when this is the case and by then it won't matter too much how much you NEED to put into the world. I feel the pain in your voice and see it in your eyes and I really send you the very best. Please be well. May our mistakes and traumas never define us. Rooting for you too. Be well ❤🙏
Love you, Will!! ❤
you used to be awesome bro and then this. we all make mistakes but some shroud you more than others. this is one of those to where there shroud, the darkness doesn't disappear.
We all make mistakes. We’re not perfect. It’s how the person handles it in the end. Communication, showing transparency, you’re a strong one for that Will.
I have made a severe and continuous lapse in judgement
We're all human
Trying to save his career lol
Weak
And actor acting
Everyone makes mistakes
Yet you still took the opportunity to put your water amd merch  in the video, shameful. I used to love you Will.
Fake apology
he used body language every time he wants to seem believable but it's actually every time he is lying that he's using his body language or at least he does not believe in his own words.
This seems fake af, people that claim to grow don't say it, they show it.
You got some nerve... Need money? Don't you have enough? What you did there can not be forgiven... That clip will glove forever on the web
Only real humans speak out and apologize when they mess up it takes true accountability and self respect to face the world as yourself everyone makes mistakes
goofy
LOL, he's trying to save face, but still doesn't get it. When he understands it, we will know by what he says.
one bad day cant make me for get will is the fresh prince, you know MR Man in black......as long as he i s taking accountability
You are loved. Forever and always. Do not feel shame, you have done what you can. <3
Aaah, will.. We get it, we are rooting for you, good that you did the work and you realises your mistake❤️
You did nothing wrong
I think he is only apologizing because it affected him personally/ financially. What he did was pretty embarrassing and the way he acted the rest of the night showed he didn´t feel any remorse.
Sometimes bygones cant be bygones!
This ain't none of my business ya'll be good now ya hear
Everyone makes mistakes. It’s not always our place to judge.
Love you will!!
It’s literally not that serious get over it y’all
When are you leaving that toxic Jane ???
TOOOO LATE FOR AN APOLOGY!!!! NOT ACCEPTED NOT EVEN SINCERE THE RESPECT IS GONE!!
FN
He still seems to be lost somehow. I hope he'll be better and learn from his mistakes, that's what matters after all. He remains a legend for everything else that he'd done.
We're all human here in the school of life. This too shall pass! Love you now and always Will. 💕
We can all say good job for apologizing but it's on him and chris to figure this out
Well rehearsed. You'll make a great actor one day! And you'll gain plenty of vicarious sycophantic enablers!
Like Martin Lawrence one said, “no one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life”.
Wow, finally!
Will you will not remember me because we never really met. Your mother worked with my foster mom at Beeber middle school and my mom asked your mom to do her a favor and have you give me call to just say hello. I was in middle school at the time and you were blowing up in the music industry. One day I came home from school and while I was in the bathroom my foster father yelled you got a phone call, I was annoyed because of course I'm using the bathroom, so I yelled back who is it? He said his name is Will and I said I don't know no Will! Later on that day my foster mom came home all excited and asked me if I got a special phone call and I told her and asked her why. She was so disappointed because she told me that as a favor you called me. So I told her what happened and she then said your name was Will Smith and then it dawned on me that earlier that day you did call me!!! I only knew you as The Fresh Prince so I had no idea! Anyway I will always recall and tell that story from time to time. Bottom line is i know you are a good person and I keep you in my prayers both you and your family. God bless you this will all work out in the end. Stay strong Will! 🙏🏽💜
Out of all the celeb apologies this is one that actually feels real
I love how everyone is sooooo impressed with this! Anyone one else would have been charged but oh wait it's a celebrity, they are such wise and much better people then we can ever be!!
It was so kind of Will Smith to solve the math problem for those professors who struggled 8 years.
Sounds kinda forced .
Good man it is Respectful
Weak
Love you Will
So hurtful to pretend this isn't media trained
Will is lost, his soul is consumed by the emptiness sold to him by Hollywood.
There are no Stones left to be Thrown unless of course one is exempt of Wrongdoing…. It’s really BIG to be Big!
It's obvious Will has gone through some mild PTSD from the incident. Anger can lead people to do questionable things, and in the end feel a loss of control, embarrassment from surrounding eyes and cowering from the thought of the incident.   Add on the fact the act was committed in front of cameras globally, and no doubt he's woken up several mornings and thought "did I really just do that?"  Time usually heals repetitive negative thoughts, but my personal favorite is surrounding yourself in a social setting that compliments and uplifts your talents and abilities, to remind you how strong and capable you've come so far and still do more.
Seems late and disingenuous. You can't go back, but the explanation for not apologizing to Chris THAT moment then waiting to do this for the public this long? Rings not authentic.
We love you Will! We love you man! It takes a big man to do what you’re doing here. Way to hold yourself accountable and  own it. Much love and respect.
Hi Will! Proud of you for speaking up in your own way and taking accountability. You haven't let me down, and I still look up to you. You're human and allowed to make mistakes, even big ones. Sending love <3
I actually chuckled a couple of times while watching this, lol.. It was very robotic. I didn't feel any kind of general emotion from him. He was just public speaking. Politician like
This is quite the production. Lame
Listen, just because the man is a celebrity that doesn't make him super human. He is a human being just like the rest of us. You made a mistake and owned up to it. Hopefully there is nothing but peace and love and light and talking with forgiveness for you and Chris after this.
Would like to see you play deadshot again! Or hell maybe act in a Predator movie just imagine it Predator 6 Starring Will Smith with the right script thats not woke it could be a blockbuster! I for one would watch it.
Jesus said "So it will be at the end of the age, the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 13:49-50. Jesus also said "You are my friends if you do what I command you." John 15:14. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6.
U good man…in the word of Dede from next Friday…players f*** up. You be alright man
hey Will. it's ok. but are you?
Love & support you. 💪❤
Why this apology resonates is because unlike the one he gave in his acceptance speech and the 2 subsequent written statements, this one makes clear that he gets it. He's living up to the example that we expect of him to be, and provides a model for redemption that we can all get behind.   I accept his apology.
just go about your business in private. help charities in private. come back in 5 years when youve done your time....
Now comes the apology after all the backlash
4 months too late don’t you think 😂
i want a apology for all the movies your son is in and hell just apologize for you having your son jaden
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
That was the realest moment in that fake ceremony,  of course its put a taint on both careers, but at the end of the day, you are still a fantastic actor and father, who should be forgiven. People should not judge, Jesus said that.
私はウィル・スミスが大好き。 何度も地球を救ってくれてるしね笑 沢山の映画でまた会えるのを楽しみにしています。
暴力は悪だが、あなたのしたことを支持します。家族が攻撃を受けたのなら守るのは当然
I still don't accept Wills apology. He's an actor obviously his apology video is gonna be good. Duh .
YOU NEVER STOP BEING MY FRIEND. You are human and we make mistakes. You are still one of my role models. Blessing and keep that chip up
This...This is the Will Smith I grew up admiring. Thank you for continuing to provide a source for admiration to all those who have admired your work for so many years.
Lets make a video of me apologizing  , his masked slipped ,mo rescuing his careet at the moment , he needs to be real , fake
This family is acting 24/7!
You seem like a nice guy who made a mistake. We all mess up. Just dust yourself off and do better going forward. That's all we can do.
Will the Cuk
Good for him. I’m glad he said something and is getting the help he needs.. Is it too soon to say I don’t feel that  sorry for the rich and famous? IJS
Please don't come back.
That was traumatizing to watch tbh. Mainly because it was normalized behavior everywhere, his son enabled it, and he was partying it out a second later like. It was so egotistical and it looked like a character move.
I just hope that these two humans can work it out between them and keep it out of the court system.  I’m so sick of people suing each other.  It’s like it’s become a greed business all it’s own
I felt like maybe you should have been a little more genuine when you said " I apologize". I feel it should have been more like "Chris...I am sorry".  Secondly, looking into your eyes brother, border insanity; You look like a man whose mental has been broken over and over in multiple past serious life events we are not aware of.  I wish you, Chris ,and the families the very best. Take care.
Man, YouTube Rewind gets weirder weirder every year…
Hope he opens up more as time goes on. If he were honest about how messed up in the head he is, he could do a lot of good.
What's done is done and now you have to live with the consequences. You can apologize for as long as you want but what matters most is you get the help you clearly need to actually change things for the better. That goes for anyone, famous or not. Best of luck.
Great Job Boss...Now We Grow
There's mercy in relationship with Jesus. Not religion .  Not the motions. I'm not talking about saying  you believe and going to church and singing the 2 songs and saying amen and going home.  Nope there's hardly any fulfillment in those type Christians. I'm talking about a real relationship where you talk to Jesus like you would your best friend. Pouring your heart out to someone you love and trust. I'm talking about real relationship with him not dead religion. The real Jesus of the Bible comes when you seek a real relationship with him. Not man made traditions or religion. He really loves you and your family and he can restore what seems lost. He can fix everything broken. There's nothing that he can't heal or restore. He's very real and I'm talking about the real Jesus that comes through relationship with him not some walking dead man's religion.
Will.. My brother.. Get away from that Toxic Woman. Its obvious that you're in love with someone who doesn't love you. She's a narcissist and she sucking the soul out of you. You're a good man you deserve better brother
Thanks for being the HUMAN that you are👍🌹💗
I love Will but him doing his charming laugh in the middle of this feels disrespectful and a bit insincere.
Make shark tales 2
Boooooooo!
Everyone makes mistakes🥹 he should be forgiven
Will you're on the right track by digging deep into your own soul, reflecting, owning and taking responsibility for your mistake and apologizing to all concerned. Hope you continue to move forward in your life and not live forever in that moment. Kudos to you my friend.
All this Good he's done and we going to deprive him from redemption....come one guys we love him and Chris...we are not around them all the time maybe this was Chris 3rd strike don't make it right BUT maybe it's a lil more behind this ...but Will is lil Denzel WE ALL NEED TO FIX THIS...CHRIS NEED TO SIT DOWN QUIT ACTING SO NEW YORK YALL ARE RUDE PEOPLE LOL BUT .....UNITED WE STAND!
why do you seem so mad about this apology though hahahahaha
it's ok, Will. We all make mistakes. You are a good person. Go forward in peace.
Can’t be that foggy dude was happy enough to party after the award show lmao
Will is forever and always good in my book. He's human being first and owned up his accountability. He's been good with me
For those of you saying “it’s up to Chris to forgive him” if y’all didn’t hear, he literally dropped the charges on him which was a sign that he forgave him. Despite him not wanting to talk with him at the moment
Fake apology
I want to see this to you Mister Smith. When you give your life and everything you are to please everyone around you and to provide for them and you worked hard to become who you were, Will Smith the actor the entertainer. But along the way Will Smith got lost everybody saw the actor everybody saw the entertainer everybody saw the man that would give anything to help anybody or do anything to make people happy with his work. You gave so much of yourself even when your cup was overflowing Pete the Bible tells you to give up the overflow you gave people out of your own cup and let them drink till it was dry and you had nothing left to give and on that night. No one gave to you everybody was cheering for your achievements everybody was cheering because of the work you had did but no one saw a man standing there in a room full of people broken and alone and wanted somebody to hug him and tell him they love him and the one person that you wanted that from did not give it to you I'm not going to mention their name because their heartbroken they're in mourning for somebody in their past and when two hurt people come together they hurt each other fame fortune and money and provisions is not love but when you look at my eyes and you can tell I'm hurting and you say come here baby let me hug you and kiss you and hold you that's more powerful than any dollar Fame Fortune House car in the world. But nobody saw that in you that night you stood at the highest peak of the mountain and they cheered you. And rightfully so and they shouted your name and rightfully so but nobody noticed you were alone. And all that achievement you finally realized you were alone nobody saw your pain nobody saw your tears smiling on the outside crying on the inside. Nobody saw a man that just wanted a hug and somebody to see him not the fame and the fortune and the actor you just wanted somebody to see you and you wanted somebody to love you that day and the one you wanted didn't give it to you they sat away from you they didn't hold your hand they didn't put their head on your shoulder they didn't whisper in your ear I love you and I'm proud of you. And that's the moment you couldn't take anymore forgive yourself first because the world saw who you created they never saw you or your pain and loneliness standing on that stage before you even got to the stage you recognize the loneliness in that room that you were totally alone in the midst of all those people all those fans all those millions of people around the world and that's a hell of a place to be. And I can tell you that because I hadn't won a basketball tournament most valuable player most points most rebounds and it was in high school and everybody had their parents there and mine weren't there because they weren't together and I had to tell a lie and say my mother and my father was at work and yet everybody was celebrating me cheering my name I went in the shower turn the water on and cry because I was alone for the first time.. and nobody saw it everybody saw the basketball player the champion the man everybody patting me on the back giving me hugs but nobody saw I was alone because I was the only one there without their parents and that's who I did it for so that they could come together and we could be a family. That's why I played basketball so they could come to my game and I could solidify us as a family again I understand loneliness will separate you from God and from everything around you and that's a hell of a place to be and that's where you were I understand and it's hard to explain has nothing to do with what you did that was wrong don't get me wrong. That was wrong and that's the way you dealt with it because he threw one dot at the one person that left you alone and you thought if you blocked that dark and protect her the loneliness will go away and she's the source of your loneliness. I'm not saying she's a bad person she's still morning she's still broken she still hurting. So the only thing she can offer you is paying out of her heart brokenness out of her heart because there's no love there it's locked up in the state of mourning
We all make mistakes some bigger then others 🥹 I still love you and I’m sure many more ♥️! You are a Wonderful actor ! And I’m sure a great person ! Who let his action took over! At one time or two I’m sure we all have done stupid stuff before ! We are all human and fall short of the lord ! Keep God first ! 🙏🏽he will see you through this ! And hopefully in time you two can talk 🙂
He’s not sorry. He’s just seeing that it’s not dying down and that it’s getting worse. If he was sorry he would’ve addressed immediately. But he sees it’s not going away and he can’t get away from it
The apology was good, the idea that HE is the victim here was ridiculous.
Good deal. That's peace and progress moving forward.🙏
Will please try JESUS. Your grandmother raised you to know Christ but you’ve turned away. Only in Him can you get the acceptance you’ve always wanted. I know you’ve tried many things but have you truly tried Christ? Matthew 6:33
A sincere apology, I felt it.  You are human, we are make mistakes, it's how you handle yourself as you too move on. You have been flawless under the spotlight for decades.
Love how YouTube only allows positive comments and deletes or blocks all the negative ones. Negativity has it’s justified place and this deserves condemnation, never acceptable to act like he did and a half hearted apology only when it impacts his finances is atrocious and must be called out accordingly.
Good that you apologized! But I really wish you could explain why you were laughing at first and then in a blink if an eye changed and did what you did. If you took this time to apologize and time to answer questions, be 100% honest and explain what the h#ll happened in your head. You chose to do this in front of all the people there, in front of millions of viewers-you want to make it right? Start by being COMPLETELY honest and open about this. Wish you all the best Will and hopefully Chris will forgive you someday cause man, you really f###ed up there...
Volviste!!! 😍 te queda un gran camino asi que a llenarlo de mucho mas exito. Un abrazo. 🍾🥂💃🏽
Kevin Hart : 🐐 his name is will smith
its ok will sorry for what happened and just try better
When I first heard about it I was trying to defend it, but the more I looked at it and understood the scope of it, the more I realized Will fucked up.  He was wrong.  I was disappointed because Will has been my dude since He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper.  But, as many have said here, everybody makes mistakes.  Some bigger than others.  He just happened to do it (basically) on the world stage.  His missteps are amplified by the spotlight he lives under.  Doesn’t make him better or worse.  And this incident proves it.  “There is no better test for a man’s integrity than his behavior when he is wrong.”
u the real man
All I heard was “please forget how stupid I was, I need a job”
Mum: " Will Ap0l0gIzE to CrIsS right n0w !  Will: "...srry..canigonow".\(:/)/
It's not your fault.
I can feel the shame radiating off you. You definitely learned your lesson, and you're right. You're human and people make mistakes. I respect this Apology, most celebrities I just don't buy it, but its clearly affected you and I hope you can find peace again.  Oh and leave that manipulative woman
There are so many shill accounts on here posting fake positive replies it makes this whole thing seem even MORE pathetic.
He who has not sin throw the first stone
We are all broken people, at the end of the day, we have to come together and ask for forgiveness and begin the healing and restoration process. Ephesians 4:26-27
Boy now would be a great time to see the dislikes
I was so disappointed. Still unsure of how I feel about it. It was ugly.
deception continues
You're always been protective for your family, so... I'm so sorry what happened that night. Hope chris will understand
wow thought i had unsubscribed from this channel LOL. i know Chris decided not to press charges (YOU SHOULD ALSO BE SAYING THANKS TO CHRIS FOR THAT iN THE VIDEO) but in my eyes you are a criminal who's punishment for the last three months has been to sit around and feel sorry for yourself and feel shame and pity and then talk about love and peace and blah blah blah!!!!. keep it real brother YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT. you not in a cell having three shitty meals a day and your freedom has not been taken away, those are actual punishments. defo make sure to remember to unsubscribe.
We love you Will. We have all messed up. To all the commenters, only the one without sin should cast the first stone.
He really did say everything he needed to say and I believe he said it in the best way possible. He made a good point about “being human”, and as humans we make mistakes. Sure, it was a pretty big mistake, but he definitely seems to know and understand that what he did was wrong and I hope that all of us give him a chance again, bc at the end of the day Will Smith is not a bad human being.
🤗❤️🤗❤️
Keep my name out ya mouth! 👁️👄👁️
How many apologies would we be hearing if this hadn’t hurt Will Smith’s career?
you ruined the night  And then you were dancing all night celebrating your trophy. Your apology is fake  #boycotting your movies
Do Hot Ones.
And the apology tour begins.
Will, the best thing you could do is find a new career out of the public gaze. Your reputation is forever damaged as your true inner workings have been displayed for all to see. Go enjoy your money and be done with your fame. Its not like people will watch your movies anymore anyway.
Sadly, I'm not sure he has really learned anything or that his introspection has yielded some actual insight. I only say this because of his assertion that absolutely no part of him thought the way he handled was the proper way to react in that moment. When, in fact the truth is there was a part of him, small as it may be, that thought it was the way to react because he did it. Unless someone took control of him, there is a part that thinks it was acceptable. Until he recognizes and reconciles that part of himself, he hasn't really grown and is at risk to do something like that again.
The reason the entire world spoke about it was because of the endless love and good will (pun intended) that you've put out before this point. Humans make mistakes, happy to admit it for myself, I won't speak for anyone else. The only thing that I think about is the missed opportunity. If you had walked up to Chris, whispered in his ear about your wife's condition, you would of been even more of a hero than people already see you as. Of course, can't be undone or changed, main thing is you can forgive yourself,. and hope Chris will come to you with time, which I am sure he will. At this point he has shown you nothing but love and respect by not doing or saying anything, which is rare in this world.
We love you bro, this too shall pass
You let me down a long time ago, fam. However, I'm glad you're doing the right thing. Standing up to ignorance is powerful, and that's needed in today's society. I hope you and Chris can work something out.
JADAS MORE TOXIC THAN JAKE PAUL
I'm glad to hear back from you. And I'm proud of you, you did good. I can't to see more from you
How much of this and that is related to his scientology?
Lost all respect for a childhood hero, sad how much a partner can break you down until you don’t even recognise yourself anymore.
i respect him for coming out and making an apology. not sayn i think this will fix things but its a start. we will see what chris has to say.
Well there’s a lot I can call BS on what he said ,  and it’s hard not to because I know he is a leftist,  but who am I not to give forgiveness to a man asking for it ... good luck in the future bro . Doesn’t mean I trust you .
Sad because I'll never look at him the same way or watch another rerun of the fresh prince
What a fraud. Lol.
🙄
I wanted to Know what did you Find So “FUNNY” in that Moment even in this explanation You still Laugh and Smirk ??  I have an issue with laughter as well but the Eye 👁 Roll got you in that moment ??? The Laugh and THIS
You’re a great man and always have been. We all make mistakes - it just so happens that yours is in front of the world. You’ll always be recognised by many people as one of the few ‘real ones’ in Hollywood and will continue to be an inspiration to me.
Your behavior WAS completely unacceptable and I will never view you the same again.  You have permanently lost a fan.
You have our respect Will. We were shocked at the time because it seemed so out of character and we felt confused and disappointed in your response to Chris and your silence afterwards. Making this apology in the way you have is a great step forward and we believe in your sincerity. Stay convicted on this path and continue to make the effort to rebuild a relationship with Chris. This is just the first step to reconciliation but you e done some good here.
God bless both you and Chris. 🙏
Great Job Will Glad to see you doing well
Thank you, Will.  As a long-time follower of your work, this as an important & needed moment. I found this message well-thought-out and well said. 👉🏾 And another thought I'm just throwing out there to everyone from Will Smith, to his team, to other fans: maybe the goal shouldn't be having people return to seeing him the way he was. Now that he has plumbed the depths of his traumas in his documentary, and then mistakenly showed the "darker" side of his emotions, maybe he won't get happy-go-lucky roles any more, and maybe that's *okay*. Maybe now, he can move on to portray deeper and more emotionally complex work.  Maybe he can portray great Black inventors, or thinkers, or even those who accomplished great things despite struggling with anger, etc. I would welcome that.  Anyway, signing out! Peace!
my dude, wheres the apology for that acting in independence day tho.  we been waitin a minute on that
I think the very best way for Will Smith to fix this is for him to donate to a good charity (big donation) and to do untiring work for the underprivileged.
What scares you more than anything else? I want to know what they are possible of that made you do this.
Show the footage of him dancing and partying shortly after his deplorable behavior, was he still "fuzzy"
Still my favorite actor
Make a new movie
That was messed up thing that occurred.   Sincere apologies are always a step in the right direction
60k THUMBS UP and 33K THUMBS DOWN
I like Will Smith, he's human.
It takes decades to build a good reputation but seconds to destroy it, you have a long road ahead Will.
Leave Hancock alone ...by the way Jesus is the only way to get delivered
He's not telling the truth
Remorse without shame is a narrow path. I hear you and wish you welll
I saw Will Smith once like in 2002  in a Barns and Noble In New York City  I walked in  not realizing he was there and My friend started screaming Omg its Will Smith !!! I was sooo starstruck I did not ask for an autograph only my friend got one I say all this to say that from my observation he is a very humble, and respectful person he was so kind to give my friend an autograph he was kind and patient regardless if her screaming in his ear lol . I felt this calm vibe from him I still remember his energy to this day .I was already a fan but from that day on I became a hardcore fan . God bless you Will Smith!!! mistakes are normal in us human beings I hope God heals ,and protects you .
Why sacrifice your legacy? What did you gain?
Who         Cares
Did you owe the liars a favor?
Weak
Bet he’s happy the dislike ratio is gone
Feels like a heartfelt apology… but was it necessary to subliminally place the Just Water as a way to promote the product?
Sorry not sorry
Too little too late. He's got too much money and too much confusion about who he is. Such a pity, he was a funny and good actor.
Too little too late, buddy. You should be in jail for what you did.
Will owes an apology to me for forcing that video on me everywhere I went on the internet for the following weeks. This goes for Johnny Depp and his court trial as well!
Why are people so invested in this??! It seems so pointless. Have you really got nothing better to do with your life??
Yeah, he made a mistake but you gotta empathise with the man. He values being respected more than anything so this must haunt him. Wouldn't be surprised if he's suffered more than Chris tbh. Not saying what he did was okay but I see that he's been doing a lot of reflecting and he's HURT
This is not a real apology. its just him answering questions like  Will Smith answers the web's most searched questions...
Unsubscribe this guy.
The deception for what purpose?
It’s time to forgive yourself and continue to be great King.
Man Will Is And Will Always Be.... A Human Being... Just like Me, You, All Of Us...   To Will, Chris And All Affected... Keep Healing... Sending Us All Positive & Healing Energy... 🙏🏾  ❤️
I am so happy to see you again, Will. I love you and I have never paid any attention to your mistakes or anybody else for that matter. I admire you bc of the man I have watched you become and still is. You have taken accountability for you mistake, ask for forgiveness, now forgive yourself and move on. You have taught me so much about being a human being. As you continue to grow, just know I wish you and Chris the best, emotionally, physically, mentally, relationally, and spiritually.❤️🙏😘
Fake
Will, I believe your words and intentions. You're setting a good example for everyone as we've all made mistakes that we wish we could undo. #GraceAndTolerance
Naa, he’s not the fresh prince anymore.
Will Smith is over Hollywood  never wants it. Him again
Ya right silly willy
We’re human & mistakes get made by everyone, nobody is perfect, so nobody can judge, only god. Will only needs forgiveness from himself & Chris.  Love you Will, stay strong ❤️
Boa garotinho!!!
I lost every respect for you. You were supposed to be one of our icons, one of our brightest lights. Never again I'll see you in the same way. And you tarnished the beautiful story of the Williams... what a disappointing turn your trajectory took
God bless will Smith always praying for you
So fake 🤮🤮🤮🤮 he did this because his hand was forced not because it came from his heart.
Atleast he grew the rest of his goatee back out. Nobody cares Will fyi
Love you will
iduno
It’s ok Will. Hope Chris forgives you.
Mr. Smith your not above the law. You should of been arrested.
You showed that even millionaires' are LOW Class,
Let this be a lesson to all of us. The moral of this episode is -  it takes a thousand years to build up a reputation,  but just one day to bring it all down. In addition, bro, don't mind me saying if I borrow a quote from the movie, Top Gun  - your ego is writing checks so fast that your body can't cash.
Bro who actually cares? It's not this serious.
You deserve kudos for stepping up and making this video. Everyone is human and errs. However, I do find your reason for not apologizing to Chris during your acceptance speech to be disingenuous. You were not too "fogged out" to apologize to EVERYONE else in the room during that same speech. Wishing you the best and hoping you and Chris get this worked out.
We love you. We support you and we are here to welcome you back!
We still love you, Will!  Most importantly God still loves you!
Product placement of the branded water 🙃
i feel bad for Chris, that moment will always be out there now for the whole world to see and it’s one of the most talked about moments in the history of award shows. Will is clearly insecure in his relationship and wanted Jada’s approval
L
are you ok will
I am so sorry...but in all honesty Mr. Smith...this video look fake AF...it's a simple curated PR video fill with PR manipulation to recover your fame and name! I'm sorry but I don't buy it.
I was supporting you until you were mean on your fan page. What tha? I'm an old lady. I was nice.
It feels like Will Smith is a 15 years old dude who knows not much about the world around him and about human relationships
Sometimes being human means we make foolish mistakes...nothing over here to forgive.  Still one of my favorite Actors! Xoxo from Dallas Texas ❤️
No one is perfect. Trauma can make people do unthinkable things. And it comes like an instinct to react. Only time can heal wounds like this.   Let us send healing energy to both Chris and Will during this time. 🙏
It takes a MAN to make this video Will. I commend you bro.
I hate politics
God loves Will Smith. When people don't want to forgive or don't want to make amends, God is the best refuge.
Anything for the cameras to make himself look good and also try to salvage his dying career...
I feel as though will is in a bad place right now and although an apology is needed it's needed to the one that was hurt and only he can heal and forgive you. It's a sad and shocking thing to have happened unfortunately 😔 iv been a fan for soo many years and I do feel Hollywood makes people become a worse version of themselves as behind closed doors they suffer in silence.
"I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement"
You have to suffer the consequence of your act bit**! I know you arent sincere, you are only apologizing because you know youre losing everything.  Your money, your power, your fame, your success Will all go until no one remembers you. I am an avid fan until that night.
He need a close friend like Bill Burr, he would've tell him all he needs to know about world
He should of started with this line: “Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down”
"I was all fogged out. I was all fuzzy."  Code for it: "It wasn't me. I don't accept responsibility that it was me. Somebody else did that."
I appreciate this
thats actually one of the most real and honest apologies ive ever seen from a celebrity. good on you will. hopefully everyone involved can move on with their lives
Failure
I think he should say. I’m sorry Chris I’ve left that manipulative woman who was torturing me
Will Smith trying out a YouTuber apology video now
I don't get it, did Will Smith had a self identity as a person, or he lost it? Seems to me like he lost it, can be wishful thinking from my side cuz I want him all good, but feels like he never had a firm self identity
Lol
Am grateful to see this, crying, it’s very rare for anyone to do this, glad he is stepping up now for all of humans for love and peace
I appreciate this video as a viewer who really has nothing to do with it. Like everyone we were rooting for you and it was a shocking moment for you more than anyone. You can’t really do more than what you’re saying in this video.
Whatever your resolve is from this. It can only be expressed through words. The mental aspect is what is hidden from the public eye. We cant forgive because we didn't occur the action. We can only accept what we saw and choose to understand or not too. That's life.
I hope you both have the opportunity to sit down and talk a few times, not just once. Humility brings about great change if we allow it, which you clearly are working very hard on bringing positive change. God Bless your journey you, Chris, both families and friends are on. 🙏🏾
Forgiveness is maturity. A lot of you want his head on a pitchfork for the mistake he made and it’s giving underdeveloped prefrontal cortex x
Apology not accepted.
Hoping you’re healing soon🥺
why is everyone saying glad he’s apologising ect, sure he made a mistake but it’s a criminal offence and a sorry video on youtube and a 3 month late apology doesn’t make up for it
will always support you Mr. Smith.
Thank you SO MUCH for coming back, Will! We love you and we’ve missed you dearly! PLEASE FORGIVE YOURSELF!❤️  We all make mistakes. But we are not our mistakes. You are so much bigger than that! You are an amazing human being, loved all around the world because you are just a genuine guy, full of warmth, light, joy and you’ve impacted countless peoples in different generations with the positiveness  and joy you care to share. Can’t wait to hear more from you! Love you and support you ALWAYS! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I will accept your apology after Chris accepts yours.
This is like a soldier taken prisoner apologizing....
I'm not in a position to throw any stones. Even at our best, we can fall short. This one moment in time does not represent the sum of Will's life. He is a descent man and has shown that over the years. He's apologized AGAIN and I hope we can all turn the page.
When normal people make mistakes, it stays on a personal circle, but when people like you make a mistake (and there’s no question about it, you made a big mistake), the whole world is on it. I can’t imagine what it’s like living in the public eye. I truly hope you can rebuild yourself. The only advice I think I can give you, is, you don’t have to be a Hollywood star your entire life, if something is bad to your health, just walk away, and just be with your family and friends. I wish you the very best
Who cares?   Next video.
God bless you, Will.
You definitely deserve forgiveness & I hope you & Chris can eventually discuss what happened & move on. Everyone makes mistakes.  However, why has it taken 3 months to put out this apology?
too little, too late
I forgive you. We are all but human.
Love you Will but plugging in JUST water in a video like this is not it..
You are human, Will. We all make mistakes, but never forget just how stupid what you did was so that you will never do anything like it again.
From what was seen, "Light, Love and Joy" as you put it, was not being delivered to you and your family in that moment by Chris, infact is was calculated to be the extreme opposite, WORLD WIDE, PUBLICALY. Thus WELL DONE FOR SHOWING SO MUCH RESTRAINT in that moment. And yes, with Captain Hindsight, alot more restraint could always be talked about as thats what Captain Hindsight does.
Will , we are all humans navigating this life experience and making mistakes is part of it. You are valuable, you are a loving being. Chris is probably taking sometime to still process and eventually you guys can mend your differences and heal. Lots of love .
Welcome back Will, u are human and you will always make mistakes, the important thing is that you learn from it.. Ur still an amazing role model, my son who 7yrs still thinks ur an amazing actor.. Thanks for this xx
Wow, I've been waiting for this for months. The return of Will. We love you so much and understand you are human. But first and foremost, pleeeaaase find every way possible for Chris to forgive you.
Seriously? You didn’t realize how many people you hurt by your actions? Guess you won’t have to worry about it in the future since you’re banned from attending (as you should be)
Oh hell. THIS is still a thing? Why was this even a thing in the first place? WHO cares?
Will never forgive u
Will owes it to himself to forgive Will, that’s his first and most important step. Everyone and everything else will come in time and in peace. Love.
Finally, keep living
I share the fear of Letting people down. An awful feeling
Proud of you for accepting responsibility ( rather than denial and justification) really heart felt. Plus you are so successful you really did not need to. Good on ya.
It's all good, Will. I forgive you.
No one's perfect, I forgive you Chris.
Wuteva. It was a cowardly move by a cowardly man.
You're only human. You made a mistake and felt like your were put in a position where you had to respond. I think ultimately this is between you and Chris and I hope you both work it out.
Ask yourself if something similar could make you feel such disappointment for the fans that have been connecting with you for 30+ years. I don’t think you could. I think you’ve developed too much of a capacity for understanding. I think if you saw anything short of constant, conscious, actual malice, you’d see the struggle inside someone and accept that a human will make a mistake.  You lost it up there for the exact same reason that you can’t see those things in yourself. You need to start seeing the part of you that’s in that crowd right next to all of us, who deserves that understanding and empathy as much as anyone else. It’s not letting yourself off the hook, it’s just getting off this treadmill of running away from being human, towards the excruciating pressure of having to be a Greek deity when someone’s approval is on the line. You’ve succeeded in those terms more than most people ever will and it’s an incredible feeling. It’s good to push yourself, but you always have all these ideas and deep fears wrapped up in *the idea of an inability to achieve that*. The reality is, if you missed a shot, you’re not gonna land in some special dismal place; the worst you could do is end up about where we’re at. Influential and manipulative people suggest otherwise and the extreme pressure you’ve had to deal with makes that place seem real. But I promise, if you look around, we’re right there too, often having as difficult a time know that it’s all going to be ok.  Every time you think of us, every time you picture us, find that part of you in the crowd. Especially when you mess up. See yourself cheering for a guy who’s done all that you’ve done. And give that back to him in the form of understanding. Go further with it, pick someone at random and try to see how they’re amazing in the context of the life around them. In ways that they themselves might not be able to appreciate. And remember that you’re amazing to them. If you put work into this, like a practice, you’re gonna be able to look at yourself with a healthy perspective. Then you get the freedom to choose to be the kind of person you want to be, mess up like the rest of us from time to time, try to do better, and know better than anyone else that you are good enough.
Just another rehearsed script. Still a tool.
Nice product placement
Should have been arrested and stripped of your award. It's not one rule for you and another for the rest of us.
I accept your apology, Will. Your life shouldn't be ruined for one mistake, especially if you're trying to make amends. I can tell that you're sincere.  I'm not going to lie, it was shocking, because we thought it was out of your character, but I understand.  You're human, people make mistakes. I just hope Chris can accept your apology, and you two can be friends/friendly.....one day.
That’s why I’m a Christian, God has forgiven me for my sins. He truly loves me and is very patient with me. Thank you Jesus Christ for loving me and forgiving me ❤️
Love the outfit 👌🏿💥
Will Smith's "central trauma" 🙄
You got a toxic chick dude you’ve got to dump her and start healing
What happened to this man? Nobody is immune to Hollywood's degeneracy and mental illness. Just leave the public eye and try to help the less fortunate with the rest of the time you have on this Earth. Come back to the Fitrah.
Good luck on your future endeavours ✌️♥️
If someone is sincere and changes their ways, I think they deserve forgiveness.
He was better in The Pursuit of Happiness…
Well, it needs to be an hour.
Respect to Will Smith. I thought for a second he'd be talking about the political and economic status of the world like his son but this is cool too ig. fr tho respect for apologizing in a formal way.
Sending light and love your way 💕🙏🏽🌟
مرحبا بجميع  ويل سميث اسطورة
Just do better Will
I used to love you from being a kid not anymore
He still needs jail time, take him to jail
I know how stressful to live with demanding, commanding, toxic treatments, specially coming from the house...
Are you taking anger management classes Will?
This has to be the most insincere apology. But all this fallout is just on Will.
Will Smith, I want you to know that you are very Much Loved.
Not buying it lmaooo
Forgiveness does Not mean Excusing, there are Consequences to our Actions for Each and All of us...
Hero to zero in 10 seconds 😂😂… actions have consequences, I personally think he’s just another celebrity who thinks he can do what ever he wants and can get away with it… it’s kind of disgusting. Bye bye 👋 will , I won’t be watching anything you make.
Sounds sincere, then again he is an actor. 🤔🤔
B tier in youtube the apology list
The thing is your not really sorry your just saying sorry to stop getting backlash.
Had to do this before everybody found out about the new movie deal.
Yo Will , you never let me down, there are situations, and those in the past we can't change, but work to be better in the future and learn from the mistakes, the main point here is to never stop trying to be better
I appreciate this from you, Will. As a fan, as a woman; most importantly, as a human. I see you, I feel you. It will be okay. You are still loved so much, beyond measure. I'm proud of the work you've done to be okay, to release shame. The work you've done is very hard work, not for the weak at heart or mind. You are so much stronger for that. Peace and love to you, always. 💛
Why is he genuinely starting to look like Woll Smoth?
My mother❤ always said a person may not remember you, but they will remember the way you made them feel.  Change the way people Feel!  🤔 Now the work begins. 🧐
Insufferable guy. Sorry Will we really don't care.
Will Smith is Back 🇸🇳
Shoutout to Will, that took courage
Love you Will❤xx
husk of a man
L
It’s rewind time
Will you are an extraordinary man and human being! You know how many ppl if put in your situation would never do something like this and announce their destructive decision and also being fully aware of thy self. You’re a rare person and I pray that Chris  and his family is able to forgive you and most of all Will I pray that you come to forgive yourself! I believe love will heal you all in great time. Love you! And love you all!  Raregem 💎🌻❤️
Hell if I care that was funny🤣
The biggest you've ever made  in your almost perfect life was marrying into the Hollywood scene of "strong independent women" instead of finding a someone who wanted to have your kids and bring them up and teach them to be good people..without a nanny. x
Yo Will.. you should consider playing a Villain role in a Marvel movie, all your life you've been playing the good "golden" boy, and it's so easy to fall from grace when people hold you that high... I think it would be awesome to see you explore your inner demons and play a villain role, dive deep into your soul and try to explore what's there and bring it to the forefront in your acting career. Living up to the highest standards of people's expectations is an impossibility... We are all human, we've all made mistakes like this, only when you do it, the world stage is watching and cheering as you fall... It's not reality and I don't think apologizing will ever fix what happened...  If you try to play a good guy role in your next movie, people will be skeptical, but playing a villain would be a boss move. Why not just roll with it and turn this experience into a positive in your career.   You would be amazing at it with your level of acting...
Will, you did let me down, but I want you to know this video does help, and it's great to see you taking responsibility.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Your not that guy
Yeah well I'm extremely disappointed.👅 NOT. I don't care. It didn't concern me. I'm still watching Bad Boys 4 I'm still getting jiggy with Big Will.
I just think its crazy because you can fr see how mentally tired he is and how much its really weighing down on him. I feel so bad for Will.
“Courage is being the way you are, no matter what anyone says about you.” We still friends my brother, a mistake is a mistake and that’s it.
Nice to get your take on things. That was a heavy event. I mean I know I only love You and Chris vicariously through cinema. Yet it felt like having one brother attack another. Really struck right at home.  Hope Chris comes around too. Love both you guys regardless.
Very few have the perspective of the intense pressure energy that was present at the time.  We are all human, and yet one moment in our dog eat dog society has the capability and culpibility to change the trajectory of everything.  Even this, an extremely public apology most will never know the intensity of feeling it brings to the table and the courage it takes to take accountability for our actions in a moment that proves intrinsically that low and behold we are merely humans having an extremely human experience at such a time where everyone gets their magnifying glass out when mirrors are required.  Forgive yourself as often as needed, because you deserve peace, happiness, and love no more or less than anyone else but it is your birthright.  Celebrate the failure as an opportunity to gleen heartfelt wisdom from and keep moving forward.  Can we stop putting people under the proverbial guillotine now though?  Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, and everyone lives in a glass house.  Compassion is needed.  Life is too short to hold grudges and white knuckle our pain to our chests like it's some kind of badge of honor.  Much love and light to you and the family as you all heal, Will.
Say sorry to Chris not your family
what a positive response to his this apology im sure there's not a massive dislike to like ratio
Low-key I was waiting for the next bad boys that’s never gonna happen now
Jake Paul level of apology.
Planets burning btw
Can people not see through this and how he doesn’t mean any of this, and that it is just a corporate way to try to save his career
Well I’d say You’re only human. It’s ok, give yourself a break. Literally no one is judging you because Self reflection is within. We all live and learn. Confliction causes confusion you’re only human so don’t go too hard on yourself just move on life is too short 🤍
Love you Will.
"I am trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself"... he was trying to apologize, again TRYING, but the point did not get across so i totally understand why Chris has chosen not to talk to Will, he is just faking it, and still does not gets it, Will is just a sad human, I hope some day he gets it... Btw apologizing to the bald headed woman, is also another clue that he just does not gets it
Kinda weird to have that water bottle sitting there proudly displayed with the logo facing the camera and un moving for the duration of the filming, product placement?
people are so flimsy and go with whatever way the wind happens to be blowing that day.
If you really want to make it right, you will speak to Chris PRIVATELY and not try to capitalize or make this another nonsense episode of your wife's show. You need a good 5 years outside of Hollywood and your relationship to figure out who the f you actually are.
Will, just trying to help but the first person you need to forgive is yourself. You can not forgive others if you have not yet forgiven yourself. Please forgive yourself and move on to forgiving others and then move on with your life. I think that is what you are doing now hopefully and so I commend you for this step in the right direction.
Your my fellow Philadelphian and sometimes we reach a point in our lives that we snap…your human but u snapping brought a lot of heat!  I will always be proud of u!!  Just get the help u need and be better…that’s all we can do!!🙏🏾❤️🤗
classic youtube apology exhale.
You absolutely should feel ashamed of yourself. Why are you fighting that? Sit in that shame. What you did was shameful, and you did it for the whole world to see. Once you accept the shame, you can begin to work on yourself to be and do better.
we ALL make mistakes, big and small... ours, thank God is never televised during a live Tv award. Everyone deserves a another chance if they are willing to rise above the challenging situations in life 🙏💪
got to get that WATER bag $$$.
Man the world doesn’t need an apology. You are human. We all make mistakes.  Kudos to you for stepping up.
Wayyyy too late.
Youtubers should at least learn from will how to make a decent apology video lmo
All love ❤️
Gotta give the man props...I was just as appalled as anyone else at the time, but damn the dude had a bad moment, give him a break... That doesn't mean he's a bad person.
the cap tho
It was a staged act. Wake up
Chris should've pressed charges. What a push over.
I love you 💗
Nu 1
This and Baldwin's sit down have to be the fakest PR (and most american) damage control stunts
am I the only one who thinks what he did was totally awesome and the best thing to ever happen to Hollywood?
Everyone makes mistakes. Glad you were honest and didn't try to make excuses.
It’s gonna be a long road for you, but i believe  Chris, that your children, those at evening that had their golden moments lost, and your fans will forgive you. But will things ever be the same. I think not.
That was weird. The poster at the wall (which in some weird way was meant to be shown) says it all how deeply in the shadows people in this house live. I dont know if this is his real home and why it was stages like this. Poster at the wall gives you a premise every time you see it that the world is sick. Its one of the tree big errors in depressed peoples mindset: The world is sick. How terrible it must be to be repeated every day that world is sick. When you go out there its sick in there. Who ever invented that poster must be pure evil giving the premise to the owner of the poster (who obviously dont see these errors in thinking) that you live in a sick place.  Now, why was this staged like this? The staged poster is trying to get away of the guilt and shame of the actor. Its far there at the corner, not to be in a spotlight, but its made sure its seen and its purpose is to try to go peoples to subconsciousness and make them think the actor was protecting himself in a sick world. We cant blame him since the world is sick and he was just trying to cope. This was just how I saw this video. And get that poster of the wall and bury it. The World is in love so go out and get some of that endless love the world is sharing with you.
You should be ashamed.
watch out kids: fame can make you “all about me” like this, and you have a victim mentality even when you are a cowardly bully
Did it once, you’ll do it again.
Will's reaction on that day came from a place of entitlement. I wonder how he would've reacted if instead of being met with disapproval, his fans would've applauded him 'defending' his wife's honor that way. Would he still say he's sorry? or is he sorry his stock went down and lost many opportunities because of it.
Want to take this seriously but when his son's water bottle advert is son blatantly in shot consistently, it feels a little cheap.   wish you the best in your recovery will and I hope you can sort whatever is causing/caused this anger inside.
If anyone can pull themselves out of this … it’s Will.  The world is watching how he’ll handle the aftermath.  Some will judge, some will continue to shame him but ultimately I will watch in awe because he will be a pioneer in forgiveness and surviving deep remorse without shame.  That shits hard and I’ve never anyone seen do it publicly.  I send you grace and space to heal.   We’re watching so we can learn.
Pfff aweonadooooo
Give me $10 million and I’ll forgive you.
Lost all respect for this man  Hero’s do fall
We love you Will, that whole situation was bizarre and shocking YES! but Most MOST we want you to be well and get back on track. much love to you Sir
Not 1 sorry
I wonder what y'all would think if Chris became friends with Will again Then you wouldn't be mad anymore lmfao
It's doesn't matter, may be you are not getting any contract now. You should have said it just after 1 or two days, now it doesn't matter. Now you are getting real lesson of your consequences.
I still love you will we all make mistakes, you haven't had an easy ride my man I know how that is 🤍
WE LOVE YOU, WILL!!!
Alopecia isn't a struggle. This coming from a mom of a 5 year old severely autistic and nonverbal 5 year old little boy who suffers from D.R.E, drug resistant epilepsy. Losing hair as a near billionaire is like the rest of getting a hangnail. She can afford the best hair regrowth and wings possible. Also, elephant in the room, I can see the stubble in her photos. Doesn't that mean she's growing hair and cigar to shave it? It seems to be a trend... bald black liberal women*.  *™️
It takes a big person to own up to his/her mistakes.
Nice man!! move on!
It wasn’t all your fault. Virtual hug 🤗 Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 Love you 💕
Fresh prince of the bin
A  really sorry  A -- -   sorry  video  mess  with your  money..?  You mess .up. everybody  night. Godfather   really .. you messed up black people's night godfather's night.. people forgive you in their own time remember that even if they say they do you got to work on it bro And anybody who invested in you. You you have been inspiring since so many people this is a letdown real okay.. it was a selfish  act... But I love you and I will forgive you that's going to take some time but the love is still there
It's so good to see him again!  Love Will Smith and so glad he's on the road to recovery from this.
Just get a divorce and therapy ‼️
1.Why...why now...Chris said hes not ready To talk,so why you go public now. 2. apologizing to his mother-makes him look to the public more like a family Person ,so people will sympatize More. 3.saying this was not really me...is one of The most narcisistic things to say..like: you know i'm better ,This wasn't The real me, it was all so fuzzy and blurry.....so they can have the second and third and many more Chances..   Not buying it,sorry.
He even did that sigh with the 'slow walk in' 😭
Don't believe it. Lol I'll wait for results.
I'm sorry guys but this is low-key worse than Logan Paul's apology video.
🤡
It doesn't feel genuine and three months nah you were doing something else dawg
Nah, I'm cool. Be well
I was never mad at Will. Shocked it happened wish it didn't happen the way it did. It's all love to Will... & Chris. You'll both come out stronger & wiser
Hope you get better miss you and your movies 🖤
We must find in our hearts to forgive others. God is love! I don't know any one on this earth who is perfect, not one!  I can say, God is faithful. He is also forgiven. And when we don't always right, but ask for repentance, He still loves us.  The Bible says,, We all have sinned, and have fallen short of the glory. Romans 8:23 Will, I am definitely praying for you and your family. Keep looking up! God will strengthen you, restore you and build you up in the right way. Trust your creator in everything. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 You can't lose. He is your provider and our way maker!
Donde están los subtitulos en español XD
You’re a human being. We love you. We miss your. We support you.  I forgave you right after it happened.  Forgive yourself and move on.  We have all done something bad or worse than that night.   I just want to vibe to Summertime in my car on the radio again. ❤️
That was the weakest apology I’ve ever seen. This was 100% a PR move to get back into the good graces of the people.
Still listening
O importante é que você foi humilde em pedir desculpas.é um grande passo para mostrar que vc errou,e que seu coração realmente é cinsero.você mostrou que realmente além de um bom ator,você também é um grande homem por admitir seus erros e se arrepender.sempre seja assim.assim que vemos o nosso querido Will.errar é humano.admitir seus erros é oque te torna diferente.nunca esqueça disso amigo.
Everyone deserves grace🙏🏽❤️
Honestly fake apology, why are you apologizing to YOUR family?? You say you're bringing 'heat' like everybody is mad at you but you brought EMBARASSMENT to your family. Everyone feels ashamed for you.
It’s a start. Everyone has something in their past that they regret.
Chris isn’t ready to talk, so you come on YouTube and force him to listen to your apology anyway? To him, his mom, his family because nobody’s going to stop 🛑 you if you’re ready to apologize? Sounds like you have a “me” problem. As in, I only matter. Should have just waited for him to be ready. This apology is for you, not him. Hope it makes YOU feel better, clearing your mind.
Good acting will, apologize 3 months later, mofo was laughing before he saw the mrs reaction
Hi Will, you have always been positive, but I feel like he is trying to keep that positive vibe going despite whatever battle you are fighting.  I understand that you are trying to set an example for your love ones, but I'm certain that your love ones don't want you to suffer.  Love yourself!  Do what's best for yourself and be happy.  Hope things will only get better from now on.
I forgive him but I need to see his actions and what he does after to see if I will still be a supporter because an apology only goes so far
This is basically the kind of apology I was wanting to see. I didn’t want him crying again and really didn’t want it to be a discussion on red table talk. Just a unscripted sincere apology from the heart.
Nope
well. We all fall down. Your response to the insult was absurd and cowardly, but it's good to see that you can think about it and perceive that there's a better way. Love and respect is the way.
Love you Will, you are gonna get thru this
I love you Will.
I don't usually talk a lot about being in a relationship with someone its your own call .Love and emotions are difficult to explain logically .You were always one of my most favourite actors.After that day what u did i could never watch Fresh Prince the way i used to and laugh and enjoy and forget the dark days i had.I can't see you the same way i used to when u praised,"The geeta" my religious book.I am happy to see u come and open up about it but as someone who has been in a toxic relationship for long time and thought it was love i will only say one thing.Get out of it Will.Your fans love you.We are there for you .You deserve better.Don't let someone ruin the Will we all love and respect and bring him back .You can save yourself Will and it's never too late to make the right decision cause if you don't that's going to be a lifetime regret.I won't say anything else but just that god bless you and you find someone better.
Too much cap and insincerity🧢🧢🧢
s*** happens
Oh my goodness man. Get over yourself. You’re not the centre of the universe. Y’know what, why don’t you take some of that humility and project it somewhere positive. There’s wars on, climate change, starvation, China, Russia. Ffs there’s more in this world than you & your experience. Stop looking inward pretending to be PC coz it looks “right”, rediscover what’s in your heart ♥️ that is all.
🤣🤣🤣
I’ll forever be a Big Willy fan! ♥️ Thank u Will! ♥️
Being Human happens..
zms
I believe you, I think you give so much joy to the world for so many years, it is very unfortunate that you have to overcome mistakes so publicly. We all did at some point something wrong but where able to mended in private and our on time. Good luck in finding peace.
what a great actor......
That moment left such a bad taste in my mouth. I'm no longer a fan.
even if the whole  world let you down dont worry Will Smith everything is going to be better in sha Allah we all make mistakes and it is really hard to do what you are doing but not everyone in this world understand you ✌️🤲🤲🤲
Pick yourself back up, brother. What you did was crappy but not unforgivable. I'll echo what a lot of people are saying though - You need to look at your relationship and ensure you're being treated fairly. As someone looking from the outside, it looks toxic, but only you can decide what's best for yourself.
The problem is…you waited 4 months to put out this video. You waited 4 months…just to sit here and say that you are some sort of victim here in a situation YOU created. Nah bruh. Man up. You messed up. You SHOULD feel ashamed.
I'm about 10 years younger than you so I grew up watching and listening to your entertainment and I'm still a fan. While I do agree with defending family, the way you went about it wasn't right. You will come back from this.
Know that you will always have fans, all over the world. We're proud. I love you, Will ❤️🇧🇷
We all need to pactice forgivness. You do seem different to me now but I forgive you.
👏👏👏🙏 we are all human. May this experience bring you deep healing not from this happening but from the past trauma.
meh...Rich people problems...
Er ist auch nur ein Mensch !!
WITH GRATITUDE I AM PROUD OF YOU HOMIE.  WE NEEDED TO THE HEAR THIS. RESPECT.
👎🏽
Crawl back to relevancy.... forgetting and forgiving...u don't deserve it
Salute SIR!.. the world will always be inspired by your realness my G!! Way to handle it..all we can do!! not the mistakes that make us. Its the ways we pave for us an others to becomes better! Your showed the full circle.
He only cares because everyone else cared and he got in trouble for his holier than thou attitude
One thing I want to say clearly having been through this myself, he's a codependent who's married to a covert narcissist. Nothing in his life is going to change until he leaves that woman and does the work I have friends that are figuring this out now.
Cheer up! Let's move on and Be Happy! God Bless
will did nothing wrong
For all it's worth, I forgive you Will. I can only imagine how bad you've been feeling. Just do better, that's all you can really do
Then lets rewind it and change the history  , that wolud be awsome 🤣🤣🤣
Oh snap
Unfortunately in this world, we are not judged on the 999 things we do right, we are judged on the one thing we do wrong. It wasn't cool what you did, but I've made plenty of errors in my journey too. How I can expect the world to forgive my errors if I don't allow you yours. You're a great guy Will. Thanks for the apologies, and the video.
I strongly believe that there is a teachable moment in every situacion,  we tend to put celebrities in such a high pedestals and we forget that they are human beings with flaws and imperfection, I know by personal experience that when we make mistakes and fall from grace and not only let down our loved ones but ourselves its like a movie that plays back over and over, bringing us the same filings of embarrassment and gilt, we are definitely harder and less compassionate with  ourselves, so I applaud you for forgiving yourself. I've been a fan since the days of fresh prince and you have and still are a source of inspiration, even before I spoke English... and seeing you taking full responsibility of your actions and allowing yourself to be transparent and not making up excuses its another lesson for us to take...for all is worth, you got this friend back
You're done bro. I can't even anymore.
When you mentioned the real fractured cost to both families, I got teary eyed. Time heals all things and I hope you will be healed too.
No, I do not accept your apology, I think if you owned it I'd be more at peace with it. I was never thinking of stopping watching your awesome movies. You are human and you did what you had to do you never lost me with it.
Exhibit A of how a toxic partner can destroy someone
Lmfao will smith making a youtuber tier apology and expecting anyone but his sheep fans to accept it.
What would of Uncle Phil think or feel about that moment ??
I wish we could see the dislikes on this
The only fair is Chris not to forgive you and move on.
What happened with Chris is a shame because I don’t think that’s wills nature, we all look up to will and I hope he returns to the top! Let’s hope he’s forgiven
Don't Need you to make me feel sorry for you, just go back to acting lol, your not a motivational influencer
You are still trying to justify yourself by refusing to be ashamed of yourself.
Proud of this brother.
Break up with her
Love you, Will. I wish you peace.
I was disappointed and embarrassed for you, but I believe that isn't who you are and I still love, respect and consider you as a person to look up to.❤️ I believe you will recover from this and be better for it in the long run.
You have apologized very well. Now Chris said he will talk to you when he is ready. So apologize to yourself for having a moment like some of us do because everyone has done it something like it before. I know you feel stressed from being under the public eye, but you are still a great person. If you ever get the change read the book 5 ways to apologize its something like that it's a very good read. But at the end of they day you still have to let go of what you did yourself and he will come around I promise. Its funny the night that happened my husband yelled at me in a really nast and I got quite when he did because my feels really were hurt and he felt really bad when we got home and he had asked me what was wrong and the thing is he didn't remember at first that he did yell at me and then when he did he got mad and upset with his self. I had to stop him right then and there after he apologized because I saw he was going to be mad and upset with his self. I told him look I forgive you. I know deep down you really didn't mean to and I accept your apology, but you must now forgive yourself and we can let this go because I'm not going to spend the rest of the day lingering on it. Let's both move on. So he will talk to when he is ready until then you forgive yourself and move on in life and if others bring it up well tell them you are working on moving past that as a person if they can respect that great if not they can move on from you.
I hope some people can understand after seeing that behavior come from such a high respect role model that I am just not able to change my opinion anymore on how i feel about will smith. Something like that has many chances to take a step back and not cause harm, and will smith taking advantage and going overboard nullified any respect i had for him and will no longer respect him overall
Took you that long? 🙄
Biggest L of the year.
Why is this being dragged out for so long? They're both celebrities, so act like it.. Will should have just paid Chris a "i'm so sawwy" fee behind the scenes, like 1-3m for the trouble and they should have done a public meet and forgiven each other and moved one..
Will, keep working with the gurus.  The journey you are on is not an easy one nor is it quick. (I know) Continue your meditations without distraction.  I don't care if you never act again, so long as you are happy brother.  As far as us being friends. 🤣🤣🤣 Will, do you really think I care so little for you that this mistake (yes it was a super huge mistake) would cause me to abandon my affections and admiration for you? No my brother.  I am still in your corner.  Be well Mr.Smith.  Take your time.  When you are ready, I will be here to cheer you on again. Be well brother. Namaste.🙂
Egotistical Loser.
You are bigger now.
Man that man really actin up that situation        hah get it
blessings & peace 💖
The fact that it took him 3 months tells me that he has taken the time to understand where this came from and to heal from what triggered him. The statement about him not wanting to shame himself- is the most profound statement!!! Kudos Will… your hard work is showing.  I’ve don’t the work myself, so I hear you- I see you.  ♥️♥️
Will Smith has the most horrific aura. He's a petulant, entitled, spoiled little toddler - trapped in a 53 year-old's body. So cringe.
when people tell you who they are, believe them the first time....Oprah
The pressure man 🤦🏿‍♀️
I love you Will Smith!
No one is perfect! Onward and upward ♥️
This is why men need to take back their masculinity
I have feeling that Will's career and his life have taken a serious toll, to the point where he is now forced to apologize. If he was contrite enough, working towards forgiveness between him and Chris should have happened behind the scenes (with mediators such as Denzel, Tyler, etc). Achieve that with him, and then come online with him jointly to say "World, I wronged Chris, we have achieved forgiveness between us". And THEN, ask the world for forgiveness. Coming to ask the world for forgiveness, yet you don't care of the fact that the person you offended is not yet ready? You just want your forgiveness, and you're going to get it anyway from the world... not sure it was a wise move.
I’m proud of Will. We’ve all fallen down. He just did it in front of the world and it’s how you recover that really matters.
I'm done with him I'm sick of forgiving people time and time again... I hope he actually does better for him his family friends Chris and his fans just not me.
Mr.Smith, There are a lot of things that went through our minds that night when we saw the incident. I grew up with you from Fresh Prince, my first cd being Big Willie Style to Bad Boys 3 and so on. I considered you my Brother through out my life as I felt like we were similar in a lot of ways similar to the Fresh Prince. The emotional “Why don’t he want me,man?” To your character being successful further on because of adversity.  You may of let Chris Down, as well as his family but you let all us fans who believed in the connection between your characters and your real life persona. I have worked on a truck (🚑) for many years I have seen bad a good done but there is a wound that may never heal, the world cracked that night. You were a light now it feels like you are a flickering candle without the fuel to go on as I watched this video. Will go get your fuel, be that light again.  Be our brother again. Get better.  Much Love 1 fan out of a billion
I still look up to you King. You're human, never forget that. Please read "Good Vibes, Good Life" by Vex King and "The Four Agreements" if you haven't already. Mistakes happen. You sincerely apologized and it's in the past. Hold yourself accountable, but the past can't be changed. Keep being the great man that we know you are. You're my idol. SO LET'S GET IT!!!
Will you let me down apologizing to a women who don’t love you
You are human like all of us 🌟🙌🏽🌟🙌🏽🌟
He realised he lost MILLIONS. This is a guy who STILL thinks he can do whatever he wants.
Wonderful apology - that’s why you are the greatest Will!
I don't care what he did I still like him and always will, Big Willie Style...
When this happened I was deeply saddened. Hated seeing 2 of my heroes in this controversy. Hopefully Chris can come and shake hands so we can ALL move on
God gives forgiveness when man does not. Take everything to him. Prayers going up for you.
You can't do nothing but respect this man. It takes a lot to apologize like this. We still respect you Will. We all make mistakes no ones perfect. 💯
I hope with everything in me that there truly is karma in the universe and you get a taste of what you dished out. Dissappointed ain't the word. Sorry isn't sufficient.
I was so upset when this happened but I respect Will for doing this and finding the time to heal.
It taken you 4 months to even do this, come off it. Bit late isn't it.
whether he did the right thing or the wrong thing will Smith did not fall out of my gracious, I feel that he only acted out that way because in his life there was a boiling point
"Its all fuzzy" bullshit dude.
If the the intent is genuine behind the apology then all anyone can do is just give it time and space.
This is so sincere ❤️
you still haven't apologized for making wild wild west.  but on a serious note... the world is unforgiving.  Christ Jesus gives the peace that surpasses all understanding.
Keep your head up Will!
Even as a question is asked about disappointing people, he started by how this is HIS trauma and a lot of other things about Will. He still can’t see this isn’t about HIM. His first words should have been I’m sorry for letting everyone down. He still thinks he is the center of the universe.
Nah chris gotta get u back yo. Only fair
I am disappointed in you, Will.  What you did was inexcusable and can never be forgiven.  You showed your a** on TV at a globally-shown public venue! 😞  However, we all would not be human if we did not make mistakes.  Not only are you acknowledging your mistake, you're showing that you are properly introspecting it from all angles, trying to make yourself into a better person.  I applaud you for apologizing to everyone (because it's not *just* Chris that you massively hurt) and taking accountability.  Try keeping this in mind: In life, mistakes are just opportunities to open new doors.  Don't let this mistake hold you back.  Hold your head high and continue to be humble. 🙏
A grown, responsible adult who takes responsibility for his actions and is accountable for his deeds. Uncommon in these times. Thank you.
❤
السلام عليكم.  هناك معجبين بك ينتظرونك اعمل على قناتك اليوتيوب. قم بجولة حول العالم لنكتشف اربع جهات من الارض. بعد اعتذارك لكريس و عائلته .أعتذر لنفسك .و انهض
Lmao 🤣
Man, this is so crazy. I know there is a huge difference about the america culture and the brazillian, but it's so strange to me how much the people beat you, like, I don't thing you was right when you did what you did, but I undestand the feeling. Here I thing that the result of that moment was treated like the same for what you did and what he said. You was wrong, but he was wrong too, and seems to me that you is the only one suffer for that, and for me this is just to wrong. You are a example and a model, and I really beliave that you maked a mistake, but the result is just not fair. Anyway, I  really thing you learned and grow up even more after that. Love ya.
There it is! That's the man i always knew. Thanks for your words, Will. I really hope Chris answer you with the same love and respect you always demonstrate to him and his family those years and now.
By damn time.
Everyone got the case of the Parasocial Relationship
You did the right thing why you apologize???
Will God bless u
what is this? damage control lmao
It’s not for the public to accept his apology.
Kanye v2
This seems very self-serving, especially considering that he opened up the video saying Chris wasn’t ready to accept an apology.   And the fact that he’s wearing a hat with his company’s logo definitely doesn’t help seeing this as anything other than a publicity stunt. I see why his family and the Kardashians are friends.
I can't say I forgive you will, that's for Chris to decide.  But I will say we make mistakes. When we do we have to own up to it, I'm glad you apologized, you let me down immensely that day but I will always see you as a hero man.  Everyone works on themselves day in and day out.  You're gonna be okay, you may not be forgiven, but you'll be okay
This wasn't a mistake Will,  this was the real you and we all saw it
I know I am just one person, behind a computer, in a little farm town in Canada, that means nothing to you...But the thing is...I don't think I can ever look at you the same way again. It's sad because I love so many of your movies and I just don't feel the same about them anymore...I hope Chris can forgive you.
Good for you man - this a good start. People do look up to you - what an opportunity to do your part to make the world a better place 🙏🏽
It’s not up to us to forgive you. Chris is the one that was most deeply affected by your actions. I admire how Chris kept on grinding and remained so professional as to not ruin and tarnish the ceremony even further. He is the one that can truly forgive him IF he chooses to.
i loved you as an actor but i'm sorry to say nothing in this video felt genuine. that was a thug behavior from someone that was high in my eyes. sadly i can't say i will be excited to go see any movies with you in the future
He is on antidepressants .  Listen to the way he is speaking.  The old Will Smith didn’t speak like this.  What happened to him.  His speech is labored.
Still love u Will always had and always will🥰😍
He’s still up here defending that woman
Tell your son to understand what his words meant
Happy that you came out publicly,Love your courage and that's what we need to learn that we make mistakes and no one is perfect!
Hi Will !I have a suggestion why don't you work on your YouTube Channel. And go around the world meeting people and your Fans.exploring the four corner of the world. After saying Sorry for Chris and his Family. Apologize for yourself for Will smith.and get up stand up No one deserve  love But yourself. When you are down .You; will Smith can save you.
Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick, ourselves up.
you need more counseling
Man’s is tryna show that he is fully aware of what went down.  I like that.
Hancuck returns
“It takes years to build character… but only seconds to destroy it”
🙄🙄🙄🙄🤡🤡🤡🤡
We’re just human. We all make mistakes and we learn from them and move on. That’s life!
[Yawn] Actors gonna act. Oh, and I'm boycotting Bradley Cooper too.
Good man Will much love
I hope it gets better will.
I will always be team Will. He’s a man of dignity & character and made a mistake. People go through things that we know nothing about regardless of how much fame they have. Praying for his continued healing. 🥰🙏🏽.
oh
He looks like he’s gonna laugh.
I would appreciate being able to meet Will, I grew up watching his work & woul be more than happy if he signed the copy of his book I purchased
We don’t feel bad for you will👍
Will , I love you man . You are the best of us all .  We all slip and fall .
Where can I get that hat?
This should never be forgiven. He degraded and belittled that man in front of the world and put chris's career at risk. Avoid him for life.
My guy
Dual camera fake apology acting
Poor Will…😢
Just know big Will, you haven't let me down. Believe that. I've done things where I felt the same but I remind my self every time I think of them, that I'm human
Whats he's saying is, he practice his apology for months now, hopefully he did a good take, and can make money again in Holywood. Only people that take back abusive partners buy this. Sadly there are millions out there.
💚🍀💚
We love you Smith ❤
Sei una persona molto migliore di tutti quelli che si permettono di giudicare gli altri senza conoscere nemmeno se stessi
We love you Will
Man, are you reading off a script lmao
this one thing undid how so many people see you, it’s such a bummer
Good to see you again Will. Forgiveness is a powerful thing. The most important thing is to forgive yourself. It does not mean a mistake wasn't made , it'd a step towards change for the better. Forgiving someone else is hard. It can take time. Not forgiving someone wears on you. I have learned that myself. Keep doing the work Will. Chris also needs to do the work, but you can't control what someone else does. You can only control what you do.
What's done is done guess he can only apologise and move on, hopefully they can both patch things up.
This is still a thing?? He owned up to it and apologised, move on, honestly
Keep your head up Will. You still got a lot of love out here!
We all make mistakes. We all can receive forgiveness. Appreciate you for your transparency. My trauma comes from disappointing and letting people down as well, so I can relate. I’ve make huge mistakes a hurt a lot of people in my life. You’re human. You are forgiven. Love you bro 💯
We all need to understand as well if Chris does not chose to forgive Will, that is perfectly understandable. Even if Will is extremely remorseful of what he did. Will I’ve always looked up to you and I’ve portrayed you as a super humble and friendly actor. This will be on social media forever so there is clearly no forgetting it. However as everything else in this world. THIS TO SHALL PASS 💕  and things will hopefully get better for you. I was shocked and just hope your life as an actor is not over. Will and Chris y’all are awesome and I enjoy your movies and shows!
Dude, we don’t believe you, neither do we care. This should have happened months ago!! SHAME SHAME SHAME.
WHO CARESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Get up Will🙏🏼👊🏼
Too little too fuckin late
Lock him up and throw away the key!!
Stay above the madness Will, damn these miserable folk tryina beat you down when you showing you wanna be a better you 💯
what happen?
We all make mistakes!  Don't beat yourself up. We can't change the past, we can only learn from it! I will be praying for you! 🙏🏾
I love you Will Smith. Watching you on the Fresh Prince helped me learn how to speak English. I watched your movies too, including King Richard. What happened on March 27, 2022 is water 💧  under the bridge to me. I am still your friend.
It’s people out here doing wayyyyyyy worse. Keep Going Willard! F#%$ what people are saying
Not acceptable, you are still canceled, see you in 2035!
Wow! This is one of the best celebrity apologies i’ve ever seen. Will appears to have such am good character.
Someone should have asked him what he thought of Kendrick’s video
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
Chris is a stand up dude, I think they’ll squash it in a funny way someday.
The amount of people in United States who actually look up to TV/movie stars is just astonishing. Don't they have anyone else in their PERSONAL LIVES to admire?   I have nothing to forgive, If there's a movie I'm interested in with Will Smith as a protagonist, I'll watch it. If not then I'll pass; its that simple. I look up for my grandpa(may he rest in peace), he was the type a man I will like to become. My mother, my girlfriend(my headache and love of my life).   People really need to live their lives without seeking for explanations(lies) from celebrities who actually live on a different world/level than the rest of us.
I still love you man
chris needs to accept your apology.  forgive... and you will be forgiven.  Seek the Lord.
King Will forever! Nobody is perfect...we're human
Bro please buy coconut sugar  add in milk and drink . mental stress relief
💜💜💜👍🏽😇
We all have arguments and even fights with people that are close to us sometimes. in our world, we apologize and move on. Yes, this was on TV with millions of people watching but I think Will and Chris need to shake hands, make apologies and amends and move forward. Love.
Great words from Will...seriously. But it shouldn't have taken a grown man over 4 months to "find himself" and do the right thing and apologize. Apologize first and foremost...then work on yourself. What he should've admitted is that he just now got the courage to finally face the music!
this whole video is actually meant to promote jaden's water box on the side table
Who is this guy and why is he trending over BlackPink ?
💙💙💙
I wonder if he has monetized this video
This apology is too many months too late. Looks like Mr fuzzy is coming back out to save your career… too late the real person came out that night and we can’t unsee it
It makes sense for him to apologize to everyone since it was a public event that people across the globe participate. And more importantly for someone who started as a comedian he should know better. Curious though how many contracts he lost because of this
Enough of the apologies, you did what you did. You made a mistake everyone is human. No one knows what we would do in a similar situation. So enough of this and continue with the good work you have done prior to this. You have been in this career for over 30 years, it is time to pivot and continue your career.
So ah.....what is it you are about to release? A show?....movie?....book?.....3 months is a long time for an apology....nice breathing exercises at the beginning tho
beyoncé ain't evan got this many views 😅
I feel your pain -been there, done that myself but, of course, in other forms of expression. It's really hard to disappoint others and yourself, and to do so so publicly, I can't even imagine. It's really hard to human sometimes and particularly to face our own bullshit w/o further harming ourselves and  others even more but instead humbly grow from it.  I'm so glad you are dedicated to love and light _/\_ even in our imperfection and mucked up-ness of our ego-responses it's gotta make a difference. Maybe it's the manure where good things grow.
Are you really sorry to Chris? Or is this a well crafted PR stunt that took your slow team 3 or 4 months to come up with? I hate to see this and hate to think even more this happened as I grew up with the both of you. Nothing but love for Chris and Will. Your temper got the best of you you had a clean reputation till that night and one moment of bad judgment and here we are. It's hard being good and liked all the time, the pressure is enormous being in the spotlught 24/7. This too will pass. Both od you are amazing entertainers and just good all around dudes. One stupid action should not define you, your career and your ability to entertain.
All you judgemental holier-than-thou haters commenting about his decisions: Let him move on! He's human like the rest of us. Thank goodness for that. He has a heart, a conscience, a soul, and he's imperfectly navigating his way on his own journey on this planet. Leave him be, live and let live  (and love).   Let's channel all this judgmental energy toward ourselves individually so we can work on holding  ourselves accountable for being better, instead of trying to change others with blame and judgment.  So many of us still love Will Smith anyway, with all of his combined strengths and flaws. Let's support him on learning to forgive himself as he evolves into even a better father, husband and public role model.
One thing I've learned in life is that people are really bad at apologising.  This felt to me like a proper apology.  🙂
❤️You still one of the Nobelist people I have had the pleasure of watching grow up. Sorry hle Ntate Will. Molimo a be le wena❤️
We must know when animals react in humans respond! Your response Amoco Stay in love
please be my friend and love me.. dudes gay
You are human. We all falter during our lifetime. The fact that you have spent some time reflecting and have apologized, speaks volumes for your character. This too shall pass. You will always be one of my favorite people. That will never change.
I CAN'T WATCH ANOTHER MOVIE WITH YOU! YOU WAS MY FAVORITE! BUT NOT ANYMORE!
Love u Will. Forward we will move!!!
Ti abbraccio Will
👏 maybe there is hope for I Am Legend 2 afterall
This is hilarious
He who is without sin, cast the first stone.   Being famous doesn’t mean being perfect. You made a mistake and manned up and apologized. That’s all anyone can ask for. Love you bro
you don´t need to do this, but thank u, this proves who you are
Should’ve just sent a text this is terrible 😄
💜💜💜
Still love you, Will. You made a mistake. I can’t speak for anyone else, I speak only for myself; I will not throw you out just because you had a bad moment. The testament to you is that this was ‘out of character’. The shock is because it was so unexpected from you. That is a good but difficult thing. You can take solace in the fact that this was unusual behaviour for you, and having followed you for a while, I know you will do the deep work required to heal whatever needs to be healed, internally and externally. Sending you prayers, peace, love and blessings.
" Remorseful without being ashamed of myself". That not how it works Will Smith.
❤️❤️❤️
Honestly, as soon as him and Chris sit down to chat is when I think this whole thing will forever be over. He got punished, but it will still be hurt until they finally make amends. That's my opinion. Hopefully they will make up and recover from this.
*waffle* *waffle*
We are all better than our worst mistake. We includes you!
You cannot truly feel remorse without feeling shame.  My advice would be to work on recognizing when your fear of disappointment is used against you by the people that you hold dear.
It’s okay, Will. It’s okay. It’s okay. We are human. I’m not negating that our choices have consequences but we have to realize one moment doesn’t negate all the millions of other beautiful moments we have given people. Let’s all forgive ourselves, do the work, make amends the best we can, and continue to live. It’s going to be okay.
I lost all respect for sissy Will, I would've been in jail if I did that to someone...
L scriptt and this is not from the heart but W pr for making this w script
I don't know man. Nothing adds up. The zen master jig is up though.
Is it just me or does he sound scared of something? His hand was shaking when he was apologizing, something ain't right
he loves this
Human emotion can be hard to manage, it takes a strong man to stand tall .... U have won me back Will .... Not that that means anything .
Your kids supported what you did,  no need to apologize to them.
I'm still a huge fan of Will. He knows he was wrong and admitting it, apologize to Chris many times now. Time to forgive and move on. Chris I'm sure love Will still otherwise he would have pressed charges.  Get Chris to be in Bad Boys 4 .....he will forgive you more Will😁. We love you Will !
I still couldn't trust someone who's capable of going to that sort of extreme. That was just far too much ego contained in one person. One would need to give everything away and spend a few years meditating in the Himalayas to fully recover.
Human nature is a MF. We all want to judge other people's human experience, in part because we learn and grow from it collectively. It was a bad judgement moment. I hope that Will understands this, as well as all of the positive, is also part of his  journey. I'm looking forward to all the positive that this ugly moment can bring.
we love you
Bing!! Gyaaaaaaah! It's rewind time. Nigga you lucky youtube got rid of dislikes
I can see that this apology is spoken from the heart Will. Love prospers when a fault is forgiven, but dwelling on it separates close friends.
I still love you Will
It's a bit tacky that your book is for sale on this page.  Bad IT move.
But are you sorry “Billy Wille Style”?
That's nice. Good message Will
I'm still with you!
Will I've always been a fan and will continue to be a fan. I'm just hoping you are getting the help you need emotionally because the man I saw that night looked like he need it. We all have things to work on, myself included. Good luck to you and hope you find some healing bruh.
Will Smith, don't try to live up to people's expectations nor look for approval from the world, but only God/Jesus Christ. He loves you regardless of whatever mistakes you've made. He loves you where you are unconditionally. Don't worry about what other people think because as you say we've all made mistakes and NO ONE is perfect, but Christ alone. Look up to him (Jesus) and he'll take care of you, and that's a promise!
Can’t undo it.
why’s he laughing?
We all make mistakes...and yours was a big one Will however, it's humbling to see you apologise and address these questions. It is not our place to forgive other than Chris  and I hope when he's ready he sits down with you someday and does so.
Dude, you are cool as well as Chris. You gave him alot of ammunition in his comedy shows. I think he'll be ok.
Better late than never... I guess.
you're like 4 months late on this one homie
He said sorry, he should be forgiven. End of story.
Travis Scott needs to watch this vid so he can learn how to apologize.
Of course he would do it this way.
Nope.
How are you going to win Best Actor, and give the worst performance of your life with this "apology".
We love you Will 💖💖💖
“He who is w/out sin…” The man made 1 public mistake out of a ton of good.. Kudos to you Mr Smith 👏🏾
I love you and all of your hard work regardless of what happened, I support you and you'll always be my favorite actor, thank you for all the amazing movies and shows that you've given us. You were a huge part of my childhood and I'll always be grateful for you. Everybody makes mistakes but that doesn't define us, I think people forget that celebrities are still just humans who mess up sometimes, nobody is perfect or always does the right thing. Stay strong, and keep your head up, and remember that a lot of us will always be here to support you.
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Yessir, will, you go my man. That’s wassup!! We all make mistakes, it makes us human, we figure out how to right all the wrongs. I speak to all of you people that we must appreciate ourselves being alive and making our own perspectives as human and people. We all have healths and feelings. I’ve been through a lot of hard times with miscommunication and issues with some people I know. Ive always own up to my problems in any situations and I apologize to them so we wouldn’t let our problems get in the way of our own lives. Problems are just lessons in disguise. With that said, this is my metaphor. There’s a problem behind the mask and we catch the problem to reveal the truth and it gives us answers about it. The more we learn, the wiser we become. We take the lessons and give it to the world. I hope I’m saying this right and if you want me fix what I said, I’ll do it.
I guess as long as you make a video "apologizing" everyone will forgive you huh.
Okay all you sanctimonious commenters judging this man. Time to put up or shut up. Confess your biggest F-up in life, and how you were redeemed. I've committed a  couple in my life and am grateful I was forgiven, most importantly by my Creator.  No matter the size of the stage, somebody had to know what you did. You can't take it back, you can't hide it. Kudos to you Will Smith. I'll thumbs up again when I come upon your image on Girard Avenue in West Philly!!!!
Still laughing
Give up the cult of personality Will
I truly _believed_ that Will was one of the few good ones in Hollyweird, so I'll admit that watching that happen during the ceremony really sucked.  Total moment of cognitive dissonance for me; didn't want to believe it was really happening when I felt it really was.  It boils down to, "I don't know these people so I don't wanna spend much time _believing_ things about them anaymore," however I grew up with this guy and the good guy image he's been committed to.  I'm pulling for him to show everyone how the good guy takes accountability and works on growth and healing. I do hope we can be friends again someday.
Chris: will I’m ready for you to apologize!
pig
Will, te admiro desde que era un niño, jamas vi a ningún famoso como ejemplo de nada, excepto a ti. Sinceramente después de la bofetada me decepcionaste, me creo rechazo tu persona. No entiendo como una persona que ha vendido su personaje  en base al humor y el amor puede actuar así. Mi consejo es que seas como eres, no vendas un personaje por vender películas o caer bien. De todas formas te honra tus palabras, y todos tenemos derecho a cometer errores. Ánimo Will y no te dejes influir, aunque en tu mundo parece complicado no hacerlo. Saludos desde España.
i dont see the big deal. he messed up, but who hasnt? he's done so much good and put so many smiles on peoples faces over the years yet the internet likes to throw stones as soon as they can. i think will is a great human being, he has always strived to be better ever since his childhood. we are all ALWAYS a work in progress. i hope he can put this behind him and get back to work. cause the world would be a sadder place without him, that i know for sure.  you never let me down Will. thanks for being a guiding light during some of my own personal dark times. onward and upward, will and everyone. peace.
There is redemption for everyone because we all make mistakes.
you know...we've all had at least one moment in our lives where we acted out of anger or instinct and didn't think it through. Given five more seconds, maybe you would have reacted differently.  But I get it. I've done it, too. Had moments where instead of taking those five seconds, I acted out of anger. And yea, totally embarrassed. And had to make it right later when I was able to see clearly what I had done. I've found that in some cases, I couldn't make it right. What I had done was reprehensible and there was no way back. Sometimes, I've been able to make amends and continue forward. People still love you, man. You've done a lot right in your life. I hope you and Chris can work this out and come back from it. If not, then this becomes an important life lesson about thinking things through. Either way, I wish you the best.
Bunu yaşamak  çok zor olmalı.  Senin samimiyetine inanıyorum,  bu video çok anlamlı bana göre. Gözümüzde 'ulaşılamaz' ve 'mükemmel' gördüğümüz kişilerinde bizler gibi insanlar olduğunu hatırlattı. Tokat yiyenden daha çok, vicdanlı bir insan için tokat atan daha ağır gelir. Tüm dünyanın gözü üzerindeyken bunu yaşamak çok büyük bir yük olmalı. Burada,  bu yaşanılan şeyde , ve ilerleyen süreçteki  bu videoda ve bence sonra yaşanacaklarda, tüm izleyenlere hediyeler olduğunu ve olacağını görüyorum. Ve bunu ancak senin gibi iyi bir baba, iyi bir eş, ve iyi bir sanatçı yapabilirdi. Sana ve Ailene sevgilerimi gönderiyorum. 💖
will smith is officially a youtuber now that he made an apology video
When he said I was fog’d out during his speech,  I don’t believe that at all.  He was laughing afterwards. The way he even walked off the stage. He had that demeanor of “  yeah that’s right, now im going back to my chair like a boss “
Oppa gungnam style?
Embarrassing
Feel for Will right now. Feel for Chris. Maybe in 20 years we'll know why it happened as they all were friends or "friendly" once upon a time.
Not proud of him and not buying it. This begins with Chris not us. Fix that first. If he isn’t ready, then wait however long it takes.
I give that a thumbs up
We love u will everybody make mistakes and i hope u will find peace in ur heart and in ur home. May Allah guide u bless u and forgive u
Will! no one is perfect, we all do crazy things.The main thing is you recognized it and now apolized and you plan to move forward with a lesson learned. #ProudOfU
He fucked up, he realizes it, everybody deserves a second chance, and I love Will Smith ❤❤❤❤
So what movie are you promoting now? Let's be honest here this is a PR stunt.
We all make mistakes. Let's not judge for one mistake when you've done so much good. This apology is right thing to do. Proud of the Prince
Why does this feel like a production.  It has an intro with the camera running with 2 long drawn out sighs.  Why wait 3 months  to make this infomercial, when you should have got in front of this immediately after you stepped in it.
We are human at the end of the day and we all make mistakes. Some mistakes cost us alot and the toll it takes as you try and reconcile with your own actions and the harm you brought to those you love is enough to make you want to leave this world sometimes. Every experience, even the bad ones, especially the bad ones, are opportunities to heal and grow. All the best to you Will Smith on this part of your journey. It is a hard and at times lonely road to walk, but necessary.
Lol months later, it’s giving fake YouTuber apologies ..
yoo it's the youtube rewind guy!!
Took way to long. I’m sure he will forgive you but the silence didn’t help
Pathetic. Calculated and scripted.
This comes from a genuine place and not publicists. Thanks Will! Hope you kings work it out.
Who's here for the comment section
It is what it is. Get back on the grind!
Why did it take him 3 months to do this?
6 months later, you apologize on a youtube vidya.  remember to mass downvotes peeps!
This doesn't really come across to me as a  genuine apology. Feels like a PR apology. I still can't believe he wasn't thrown out by security
I have even more respect for Chris for the way he handled himself
Jesus and I we love you Will.
You been a good family man letting the whole family get shine when u the only one not with only talent but straight legend status. Time for the family to step back. Use Daddys money and fade out. Stop making this legend look like a clown.
Bruh we all moved on already.
Great acting Will
This doesn't mean a thing, until Chris decides to forgive you. Frankly, our disappointment in you in irreparable; and I guess, it is what it is...
It's rewind time
Nah I don’t feel the remorse
God bless you Will. Total acceptance is love, those who haven’t accepted you for your positive and negative acts don’t love you. Love you Champ! Thanks for showing the world how to ask for forgiveness, and how to seek to humble the self.
Give each other a hug. Life is too short
Respect to chris for carrying on and continuing his standup tour.  Chris may or may not forgive will and he isnt obliged to.  What Will did was disgusting and hurtful.
At least he apologized and owned up to it. Maybe this apology came late, but it’s between him and Chris. That’s their problem, not ours.
We all do mistakes, 1 mistakes does not define who we are, it helps us to overcome things we have been through. Don't change your energy and who you are, we miss you.
Nothing complex about it. A bit of "youre ego got in the way of rational thinking" and a bit of Jadas controlling influence/your desperation to ensure that everyone you love is always happy.  You reacted rather than responded.
I understand both sides of the hot button issues but honestly your both amazing actors let's stop fighting
Ave ndikuthanda, so great to watch you again and can’t wait to see you out working everybody.
He’s rich he will be ok & he was reading it all off some flash cards probably 😂
This was a hard video but an honest video. Still don't know what I feel about it but I didn't "dislike" it like I expected to do
I'm quite distracted by the position of that lamp behind your head Will. Could you re record this without it please? Thanks.
Is that will smith
Took you long enough.
Since you deleted this comment earlier I'll say it again: IF THE WORLD HAD CONGRATULATED YOU INSTEAD OF SCOLDED YOU WOULD YOU BE MAKING THIS SO CALLED APOLOGY VIDEO? YOU'RE ONLY DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU SIGNED A NEW MOVIE DEAL AND ARE DOING DAMAGE CONTROL.
Bright was a really cool movie, would love to see a sequel
It’s honestly up to Chris to decide whether to forgive Will or not, everyone has their own opinions on the matter but the decision falls to Chris himself
"I apologize..." isn't the same as saying "I'm sorry."  I don't buy his apology, this is more of an orchestrated PR stunt to try to save what little image he has left.
from invstagition waching this 7 times with other officers we do feel like he is lieing and he is not giving a true aplogy, you can tell by cheek movments and his hands giterling up left and right, and he keeps sayign um...
I’m your friend at heart Will. You’ll be ok bc I want that for myself & you as well. You’re not a piece of 💩 you’re human & you had a human experience.
He made one mistake I forgive you Fam ✌️
Imo this is kinda too little too late…. My opinion only
You should apologize to the comedian world. Dave Chappell got attacked at one show, and bars in New York basically had to put up signs to not do what you did.  Can't lie, this has your influence all over this now.
Well. That was sincere. I think the best of Will Smith is yet to come.
Timestamp for the questions?
What's wrong with your wifes hair?
Thanks for being brave and talking to all of us what's done is done it's between you and Chris to deal with in private i personally can't wait for you to get your bubble back you are truly being humble and I thank and miss your laughter good luck to you and your family xx from Gerry in the uk xx
Our Heavenly Father said to forgive so that we can be forgiven. Will, in my opinion did the right thing. Now it's up to Chris to do his part.
Do this right and u will be stronger for it
Fresh Prince and Men in Black, together with Big Willie Style, were very important to me growing up. I was for sure, one of the long time fans who were very, very disappointed and confused. I respect this video and i will do as you suggested at the last questions, with holding on and hoping that one day we "can be friends again".
We love you Will. I guess that’s why the event was so shocking. You’ve always put such love and light into the world. It was so out of character for you. We’ve all behaved in a way we never imagined we would. You will not be judged by me. I appreciate the video so much.
Takes a big man to take accountability …hopefully Chris will reach out when he is ready and the real healing can begin!
Shame on you mr burgendy
This is all fake the only reason he is apologizing is because he attacked his fellow freemason brother.
That whole thing was sad on so many levels. My heart hurt for both you and Chris. I wish it had never happened.  You are both wonderful comedians, and Men in general. I truly hope you both can get past that stigma of that incident. The acting and entertainment world would be sad without either of you in it.  To both you and Chris, hold your heads high and please be better people.
Honestly if I was Chris I wouldnt want this horrible apology
It's chill bro, just try growing up
It takes courage and humility to publicly acknowledge your mistake and apologize. It’s been 3 months since the event so some people ( Chris’s family and himself mainly) might say it’s a late apology but it’s never too late as long as the people involved are still alive. Take it or leave it but it is what it is. Good for you Will!
Love you Will! Then, now & forever! Stay up!
I will turn into a convertable
all fake
Word for word, a youtuber fake apology video. Even has the same Sighs in the beginning lol
Ya déjenlo en paz! Si no mató a nadie! 😥
Thanks for this love you forever  🥰😍 We all make mistakes 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Love you Will! Still my role model ✊🏾💯
Naaaah, you should take another year or two off.
We learn and grow from everything we do. Its a learning experience. Very proud of will for standing up and working through everything and apologizing.
For the part of his explanation that has to do with those who admired him.....we get it, understand and appreciate this. We too are flawed. I wish him peace, love, and healing. ❤️
You ARE human. "For all have sinned" Romans 3:23 We've all done stupid things, said stupid things, hurt somebody or a lot of somebodys. We all have done that.  We. all. have. done. that. Difference: We have not all done it in the public eye. Difference 2: We all don't have to measure up to so many opinions of us. Encouragement: You are loved by your Creator, by your family and those who know you well, and still, yes, still, by your many fans.  Hope: There is hope from the One who knows you best & I believe He will help you fix the things that need fixing, and heal the things that need healing.  He's done it for me and countless others before me. "Love God and Love one another, like you have been loved (by God)." those are the words from the One I look up to the most. I used to worry about letting people down. Now I focus on not letting God or myself down, and you know, it works out that other people are pretty satisfied with those results too.  It's a journey. Keep walking. You're not alone.
ehhhh. i don’t buy it. just because the way he apologized.   for the people he really loves he said i’m sorry to them directly. but when it came to Chris, it was “i apologize to you”. seems disingenuous
Thank u will for Apologizing
Nice to own up time we forget about its between Chris and Will.
Will Smith is a human among everyone else. He made an abrupt mistake that will live with him for the rest of his life. It is inhuman of everyone else to now look at Will as anything less than human. Just because Will has made a mistake in his life that he now HAS to live with forever now shouldn’t mean he should be treated any different than anyone else. No one should hold on to grudges this deep that this man can no longer move on with his life. Everyone loved Will before and frankly this event that happened personally doesn’t change my opinion of Will because I know what he did was uncalled for and childish, but his intentions were not entirely putrid and deserves to be treated better than this. This isn’t human. Let’s move on.
Don’t worry Will, we love you.
Shouldn’t will smith have more subscribers than Mr. Beast
That was the weakest apology ever
I must admit it was disappointing to see, however I try to be empathetic and I don’t know what stress you were under at the time. I have seen too many people ruined by one mistake and it’s not something I want to see happen.  You have done good and I’m sure you will again in the future.  One step at a time.
You are old news and garbage. Weirdo you showed your true colors. Too little too late, get help and disappear.
“But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” Proud of you Will.
it was kind of funny  you shouldn't have apologized
This may not be enough to amend the situation but I didn’t doubt his sincerity in his apology and I’m one of the fans he disappointed. I appreciate seeing an honest and heartfelt apology and taking responsibility, truly a rare thing to see.
Don’t be sorry, be better....
BLESSINGS to you WILL.  Only GOD can judge us.  We are still here for you. 🙌🏽🙏🏽
We love you Will. It is never easy facing a difficult situation and it takes courage to take the steps you are. Healing starts somewhere! Keep up the good fight my friend!
God forgives you and I forgive you thank you will for this to see you make this video is a hard thing as man. stay strong brotha and like you said we are all human and make mistakes we need to learn from them and move on praying for you and chris . Thank you will god bless you .
Clown
We love u Will and God knows the hearts of men. U don’t have to feel ashamed because of us. We’re all on our journey. Peace be upon you. I luv u
Sick person. Takes you months to do this. How sad
no thanks
You owe us ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You are still an AMAZING human. I love you.
It's been a year daddy
YOUR EGO IS NOT YOUR FRIEND !! BUT IT TAKES COURAGE TO DO ANYTHING - BEFORE & AFTER !
Chris said he didn’t want to talk so you make a youtube video to monetize this lmao 🤡🤡🤡
Once he said I'm sorry babe.... I stopped the video because this isn't a true apology and I hope Chris and his family DO NOT accept this.
❤️❤️❤️I was thinking about you the other day! Glad to hear you are ok and no one is perfect
In time, you will be back on top.
My favorite actor. Sad to see him like this.
Get a divorce
Too little, too late!
Ehhh, we all got some kind of stain, most just pretend it never happened. You've given me many hours of escape to a better place. Just let the man kick you in the nuts live and move on. PEACE
I have an ferocious temper. Especially when it comes to family members. I could give 2 shits what people say about me. But when people say/do to my family? You got a grouchy bear on your hands! LOL All of us have these emotions man. Everyone is guilty of em. Its one thing to make a mistake, We learn from it and move on. Just part of life. You did the right thing also by waiting a few months to do upload this video. That way, People has had a chance to cool down and listen to you. My advice to you, Is focus on your music career and take an extended leave from movies. When you do make your next new movie, It would be the comeback of comebacks.
Thanks for apologizing
Your ego got to big and felt confident that your actions wouldn’t be penalized! You’re apologizing now because of the consequences, not because you mean it!  The smith family needs out of Hollywood and into a therapist office! All of you need to retire far away. You got the money.
Yaaaaa Its rewind time
🤷🏾
I always liked Will's work but this apology seems fake.  Doing it before his new movie comes out.
I pray him and Chris can mend. I have no dog in this fight but I appreciate his apology.
It's not so much of what you are going through, but how you recover that matters. Keep doing the work on yourself. You will get to a great place again. Let this be a teachable moment. Fail forward! Let the past stay in the past. This journey called life will not only bring disappointments but joy too. Thanks for having the courage to keep moving forward. Peace & Blessings!
Will, I’ve been praying for you a ton over these last few months.  I also have to say that I am so proud of you for the way you responded.  In fact, your response to this event may be your best example yet.    Ownership, humility, and emotional intelligence are things that are rarely taught through success just as they are rarely demonstrated after failure.  I hope and pray that I can be an example to my sons and daughters and respond to my failures half as well as you have.  Praying for continued healing and restoration.
We all make mistakes brother.  People who judge you have also hurt people at one point in their life. Take accountability and look for thr source of what caused it and eliminate it.
Good on you man.  Very well spoken.
Proud of you will …. come man no one else wants to say why you did it, but am there with you man I know the feeling all to well
Good to hear from you Will. We all make mistakes
I saw him apologizing on Facebook on the 2nd or 3rd day of the incident
Damage control
You were truly missed . I don’t generally follow celebrities at all however I checked everyday to await your return and I sure am glad you are finally back. There is power in humility and sincerity , to err is human , however to admit your wrongs is grace. Glad to have you back . Praying for you. This is truly humbling to witness. Sending strength and guidance your way. We are all broken people in a broken world . Thank you for being vulnerable . There is such a strength in owning your weaknesses.
I know what is like tho fell frustrated.Will I love u bro,is hard ,but demonstrate to your self how much u got ur back and most ppl don't appreciate you as a person,let it go,focus on the real what's done is done he is gonna let go too Chris has a big heart too.... Respectfully  law of attraction
Will, you never disappointed me. I consider you to be an incredible person, an excellent actor, a family man and, above all, a human being. I hope this fog clears soon and I arrived and may only good things come into your life, you deserve it💕💕🇦🇷🇦🇷
No thanks
He should've apologized that night not 5 months later.  So it took him that long to apologize?  Doesn't mean anything ...too little...too late.
Welcome Back!!!!
If Chris was white would you still have done it ?! Shame on you.
Love you Will, everyone makes a mistake, never stop loving you that day, because we're all human. no one is perfect.
ARE THESE EVEN REAL COMMENTS??  Something feels fishy around here 🤔
Respect to Chris for how he handled the moment, and respect to Will for being in this moment reflecting on that moment, it is now for Chris to now decide on how or if he responds to Will moving forward
Guess someone's career goes down so
❤
I've been a Will fan my whole life basically. It was a silly thing to do, BUT, I still respect him for at least trying to clear the air. I won't fully forgive until I see these guys hug it out.
love you
seja feliz 🤗🤗com essa nova experiência 👍🇧🇷🌸
Every time he says 'Chris' my instinct says 'Gardner'
This is it. This is the way you apologize without playing victim. Some influencers should take notes! You go Will
Apologizing because he can’t get any work really smart m. He thinks apologizing will get him his films back and career. Doesn’t he actually mean it!?!? Will never know.🤷🏾‍♂️
Just by the way he is speaking, drawn out phrases, pauses etc., this is clearly a performance. A badly rehearsed one at that, I get the impression there are even cue cards off screen with an outline of predetermined talking points. There is nothing genuine about this entire video.
This is weird...the last 5 years have been weird with the Smith family, I still like Will's acting in some movies, like Men in Black, those movies were great! but I think him and his family are a bunch of scientologist weirdos.
We don't care about your apology
I have a question…”where were you the last three months?” Oh the beaches of Dubai…got it.
Good first step. Unfortunately now it'll just take time and consistency to back up your message. I believe in you! And I believe in Chris, this is a hard road but one full of healing.
I see you trying, but a lot was still about you. Wanna show folks you're truly stepping up? Give up the award and only ever play Mr. Rogers-type roles for the rest of your life.  Your tough guy side isn't something that's gonna fly anymore.
Took 4 months for this?
"Everyone makes mistakes, the most important of it all is that you take responsibility and accountability for it; This is what makes you grow."
Losing respect for Will is one thing, he could earn that back if done right. It's how many times have we seen rich Hollywood elites or politicians and their families get away with something that would have landed us right in jail that bothers me about this.
Not easy to admit your wrong doings, especially when in you're such a publicly vulnerable position. Will's actions were inexcusable and he deserves the criticism he's received. But to be able to admit to all that with the world at your throat is an impressive first step forward.
I'm still your friend big Willie🤗🥰
DISLIKE BUTTON RIGHT HERE 👎
Happens bro
The problem with actors is you never know when they're acting
You need to apologize to all the winners who got their awards after you.  And you need to apologize to Judy Garland and Lady Gaga.  No one remembers anything that happened after your little incident.  You took that night away from so many people.
I feel like you got sucked so far down the celebrity rabbit hole. You still say you are that guy from Philly, but it's clear you have changed just from reading your biography. Your ego needed to be put in check, and who knows maybe this is what does it.  You were such a big part of my growing up in regards to the 90's and early 2000 culturally, so I hope you do come back better from it.
We as humans have ALL made a mistake or two in our own lives. You, unfortunately made your mistake on live television. You have apologized publicly and are working on your own demons. I pray that all of the people you hurt can forgive you..but also that you forgive yourself.
“Sorry mate, I was an absolute bell ended, shouldn’t of done it….I’d had a few so I was  a bit bevvied, you know how it is. Still, no excuse”….there. That’s how it’s done.
When those two men sit down and have a conversation that will be that. It’s between them now when Chris is ready…❤️❤️
you're lucky youtube decided to remove the dislike button
Three months to do this,, not interested !
We love you Will! Everyone has a time in their life of awakening and healing….
Of course he's going to apologize on Youtube.. lol
Just get better. You have deep rooted issues you need to overcome. Once you do that Chris might reach out and the public might accept you again.
Porfavor deja a tu mujer, es toxicidad pura y dura.
Get Out of it Will. Move On!
Will, thank you for trying to apologize sincerely. I was a huge fan of yours. Yes, your behavior completely shocked me. I was so disappointed in your behavior. I always thought you were an amazing role model for children in our country. So much so that I stopped supporting you completely after the incident. After watching this you are correct. You're only human just like everyone else. We as humans make mistakes daily. It's what we learn from our mistakes that define each of. I will support you again. You are an amazing actor & human. Thank you for trying to fix something that is going to be so difficult to fix. Chris, was humiliated worldwide & does have a right to be upset. Hopefully he will  speak to you again one day. Kids everywhere are watching how the 2 of you handle this unfortunate situation. I do hope both of you can resolve this peacefully. Prayers for both of you & I do support you again. I wish both of you & your families the best. Thank you for years of entertainment. Xoxoxo

His PR agent must be one of the best out there. They simply waited it out and now they're rebuilding the reputation. To me it doesn't sound sincere at all. I don't think it does even matter anymore. This is so super directed towards the fans - not Chris.
Nope!
probably the best apology I've ever heard. didn't shirk a thing, went right at the problem. sounded genuine.
This is what a man does - he owns his mistakes. Well done Mr. Smith.
Good on you 👍 So much respect for being real. It takes a strong person to reflect and take full responsibility for your actions and really feel it. Hoping you guys can heal and move forward.
you showed your true colors. and a slow learner if it takes that long to apologize and see the damage something something like this could do. it's a lesson you should have learned in your teens. and it feel like a fake apology.
Nope
No matter what I think of Will...this is stand up... I wish him well.
THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW.
And your clearly not canceled so move on and be a king g
Bravo.
Get jiggy wit it!
To little to late…. Just a photo op .. only about Will .
I remember watching the fresh prince of Belair the episode about his dad and he asked uncle fill “Why don’t he want me”?!?!? I think about this all the time and unle Fill just gives him a big hug and don’t say anything else. Will you probably will never see this but hey yes you did hurt a lot of people but right now no words will help just a hug and that’s what I i could will offer to you. Stay up.
You made a mistake you apologised, ppl should get over it. You shocked the world yes by your inappropriate action but it goes to show that you are just an ordinary man like the rest of us that makes mistakes. Peace
❤️❤️❤️❤️
also i listen to will smith old songs that he had ..
You need to let that person go! She is the root of the problem she still love 2puc. You are better then that Smith get over her and move on I know it's hard to hear.
It's all love prince!
In my opinion your behavior was unacceptable and you do not deserve Chris pardon. You wanted to humiliate him deliberately and he kept his cold blood nevertheless. You fucked up and must pay the price for that!!!  I liked you as a funny actor but now you look ridiculous to me.
All is well
Have you discussed Jaden's public endorsement of your actions with him.
pfft
His face is so aggressive... Gross
Big Willie Style! My Man! Your apology was real and authentic, I can tell you that I am ready for you to come back to the big screen and bless all of us with the "I Am Legend" movie and the others that you were working on prior to this incident. Looking forward to your journey after this my dude. Jah Bless!!!
there's an emptiness in his eyes
He who is without sin…no one is perfect and EVERYONE has done things they wish they hadn’t. Forgive yourself and do better. Lastly, if CR isn’t ready to talk, give him space; LET IT BE🙏🏾
I LOVE YOU WILL SMITH.
❤ we all make mistakes ❤ i love you 😍
God, I'm glad I'm not an idolized celebrity.
Welcome back. 😀
When he talks about shame, it is from Brene' Brown. She talks about shame in a TED talk. She gives incredible insight into shame. We are human we make mistakes, we are not our mistakes.
Will we are just humans, sometimes emotions take control I am pretty sure that if you had few more seconds to think... it could end without worldwide "scandal" I am disappointed on world- how people reacted I am not here to judge. Let's just move on.
A real man knows when to put ego aside and apologise. Respect you for this Will
Hey Will, hope you're able to make some progress on how you view yourself. Take it is easy man. Definitely a fan of someone who's made mistakes who genuinely tries to learn and improve from them. You got this!
Will necesito subtítulos 😫
2 letters for u, @Will Smith:   and   ! U  f know what they are. A lame disappointment of a former good man. You let so many people down.
I completely respect you for owning up to your truths. We have all done things that we are not proud of. I pray that you and Chris can work things out and just move on. I have always loved what I know about you and I have always loved your work. Keep pushing, my brother. There is no one that can cast the first stone at you.
Good Will hunting for his next movie gig. He still has the acting chops!!
youtuber apology sigh
Smith earned some respect back today. This was done with humility and sincerity.
I appreciate your humbleness and self reflection.
This is what a toxic woman can do to a good man.. I really feel sorry for Will as well, dude is clearly not in the right state of mind and that stupid act said it all.. Most of us from the 90's grew up watching Will being one of the best actors in Hollywood history
We all make mistakes <3
It took him 4 months to come to this point.
No, Thank you. You don't want to apologize, you want those contracts back.
It takes a man to be able to apologize a true man
Say brother Will I still got love for you and I'm still a fan. You're holding yourself accountable for your actions and hopefully you and Chris can work this out and move forward in life. 💪🏿💯🔥
More than anyone, he hurt himself with that move, in a lot of ways. Chris on the other hand, benefited in a lot of ways. So i believe indeed that he is 100% sorry.
In any mundane situation it would have likely resulted in some yelling, some people not exchanging words for a while, an apology and then everyone would have moved on.  This kind of mistake, or "snapping" happens in real life, to a lot people. People that may have been good their entire life but someday will take one offense too far.  No, it doesn't mean there shouldn't be consequences, and consequences there were.   But at the end of the day, it's one person making a mistake, and if you aren't able to forgive that you may need to do some retrospection of your own life, because maybe you haven't yet realized (or forgot) that you probably made mistakes too that affected people. Heck you may not even know about it.   Good on you Will. You did the right thing.
Big respect for you to do this. I've been with you since back in the day, way back in the 90's and know this was a one off. You are a good man and you are legit. Time will heal these wounds.
I am not this hair, I am not this skin, I am the soul that lives within. Rumi
My need to please is and not let people down is my biggest downfall. I feel this Will. It has taken me down some dark lonely corridors, so far I don’t know how to get back.
It's not our image of him, it's his own image that he built to be someone who he isn't.  All actors are fake anyway.
It really takes a real man to admit his wrong with true sincerity I hope you and Chris could someday move past this
He reached out to Chris, good. That should be the end of it, come back when Chris thinks it's OK to open all this up again. This is all about Will and his career damage control. Well staged, everything neatly placed, the white cap/clothing as with the Ellen apology. You think you're seeing a genuine person feeling remorseful that wanted to do this, this way? You are all seeing a staged production.
Thank you Will. GOD Bless
Your Apologies Mean Alot Don't Live In Regret You Are A Amazing Human Being ❤ Love You Will - ps. 🦸 Your Biggest Fan 😁
Will don’t beat yourself up over this, everyone has had a time they were triggered and reacted poorly.
I will always look.up to u man.. You really Have Motivated me through out the Years🤙🤙
❤❤❤
This feels genuine and I'm really glad you did it. For anyone who might read this comment, please don't judge someone based on one moment in their life. Everyone stumbles and we should try to lift them back up. Will Smith is a good guy and I hope he's around for a very long time.
A-train apology
Was this a little too late? I did feel he should have done this a long time ago but he explained he tried to reach out and heard nothing back from Chris. Its not for me to accept hus apology thats up to Chris. You're a human being who made a mistake. What you do after is what i want to see. You reached out so now we wait to see if Chris will respond
Awwww NO!
Blah blah blah. Sounds like a defense not an apology, so why bother? Just to make yourself look good ?One big fat bunch of bs.
I forgive you will, and wish the best to you and your family
WE LOVE YOU WILL! GOD BLESS!
Will i love you no matter what the best <3
I mistakenly used salt instead of sugar.  I mistakenly took a left instead of a right.  I mistakenly used regular gas instead of premium.  Conscious decisions are different
Too little too late you are only doing this cause it hurt ur image not cause u feel bad still done watching anything u put out
Thanks for taking the time to make this Will. Did you make a seriously bad decision? Yea, we all do and it’s part of the human condition. I hope the vulnerability and the palpable remorse that you’ve demonstrated influences Chris to make amends and move past this. You’re both insanely talented people who have an oceans worth of community standing behind you both supporting you.
Get lost willy.
Very big of you to do another and more personal and open apology, hope you find the peace you’re looking for and also I hope ppl would just drop this now and move on am pretty sure you and Chris can work together in moving pass this when the time is right
I still cannot get over the fact he didn’t apologize to Chris during his acceptance speech.  Almost like he made a point that he wasn’t apologizing.
Lol. Then put your book for sale.
Big fan since I was a kid. Watched you since Fresh Prince and love all your movies. Even though shocking, I still have much respect for you and appreciate the apology.
Good job, Will.  It's good to see you growing from this experience.
Good. Now negotiate a buddy cop comedy starring you and Chris. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD would pay to see it :)
Every time he talks I feel like I’m watching a movie 🤣
This is a new level for the apologize videos
Forget you Will.
I couldn’t forgive. Would take a long time for that to be possible. I’m not about the “asking for forgiveness later”. We all know what we’re doing
Been watching you ever since I was about 8 or 9 I am 26 now
🙏🏿🙏🏿🇧🇷🇧🇷 tamo junto Will
seeme not sinceer.
Forever the Prince in my eyes Brother
You’re a human being. That means you’re IMPERFECT. While we expect leaders to lead well, we must remember all human beings are fallible!
I love you will
One hundred percent respect to Will always however I’m kinda disappointed with this whole apology thing. You made an emotional decision that felt right in the moment. Hold it!! There’s really no need to issue apologies publicly for something like this, thus this is just pandering tears and all.
I hope Chris Can find it in his Heart to forgive Will
too little / too late ... and should have been a private moment - not a produced video on the internet
leave that woman she is the cause of all this...
Yuck
It's times like this I want the Dislike counter back
Someone needs money again
Well Will.  You are not, never were you or will you ever be a piece of sh**… so stop worrying about that.  Some people are gonna use this opportunity to rub the hypothetical “piece of” in your face. And again, you gotta stop worrying about that. You did something you thought was right but in the moment you realized it wasn’t the right thing. You made a mistake. You’re owning up to it. You’re asking forgiveness. You’re gonna live a different way moving forward. There’s not a whole lot else you can do. Either the other people are big enough to see it and move on too or they’re not. At some point you will just have to dust this right off your shoulder hon.
Love you Will, we all make mistakes and you’re a real one for owning up to it.
As someone who's been on YouTube for a while, when people make apology videos like this they always play it up with their YouTube acting skills, they try and make the video super emotional, etc... This video is straightforward with no added emotion which is surprising to see from a professional actor which is why I think the apology is genuine.   This apology isn't meant for us so WE don't need it to be genuine, but in case there was ever any doubt I think it's safe to say it is
That was stellar. We still love you Will.
even your acting is not great in this video stop what is the complexity of that moment you are 50 year old guy behaving like a 12 year old kid you are realizing this after 3 months i also looked up to you i thought you are cool
I never saw what was so wrong with the smack in the first place 🤷🏽‍♂️ keep niggas family out your mouth.. and I thought Chris was a real one for how he took it and carried himself after till this day. These are two strong, successful black men I’ve grown up with and looked up to, I hope they can work it out. But let’s put an end to this one way or another.
I don't want to sound critical....I have my own issues. But the Williams family lost that day also...
It's all good Will, we all make mistakes because we are all human, no one is perfect.
I´m so proud of you, for facing the problem. Not for running away
Apology unaccepted. Thanks.
Stevie Wonder can see this guy is not sorry at all. Your ego is out of control dude, keep it up in you’ll be back in the hood.
I get that people are mad and disappointed, but at the end of the day he's human. He made a mistake. Also, the apology isn't for us, is for Chris. He decides if he wants to forgive Will or not.
This feels far more like a performance than an apology.
You mean for the last three months you've been vacationing in India and having fun.
Okay Hancock, put yourself in jail (like you deserve) and do your time, then people might forgive you eventually, but that's not up to you. Also, advertising your biography book with this apology video is about the most tacky thing I've ever seen someone do in my life. ~_~
Naw, he needs an interviewer to put him on the spot, put some heat on him a bit
I love Will all over again because i can here the tremble and sincerity in his voice no one is perfect i hope he is forgiven and realize its time to let go and love on one another ❣
I'm all #TeamChris but that was a nice apology, I liked it. It sounds like there's some backstory but he is trying to keep his head up with his eyes down.
I absolutely think in this case everyone should forgive and forget and just move on.  As far as I am aware this is the only thing Will has done that has been in this bad of taste.  He he had a track record or something of this sort of thing then it would be a different story but hes always seemed like a good genuine person and has worked with so many people over the years and never did anything like this so I think  its important to forgive and not let him be defined by a single moment of poor choice.
Still love you will. Never stopped.
Lol these actors grovelling back after doing dumb stuff. He's gone. No one wants this dude on our screens anymore, you be best just to fade away now. Oh and BTW, the tennis movie sucked and no one watched it.
Time will heal.  We miss ya.  Hope you and Chris are able to mend.
I certainly do not condemn you. I cannot because I am human too. There are decisions I wish I could retract. I pray that your relationship with Chris is restored and I pray for good to be realized. May what satan meant for evil turn out for your good.
"... if you hold on I promise we will be able to be friends again." Damn. Kinda sums the ethos of Will Smith doesn't it?
I forgive you, Will!
How are you gonna apologize and be smiling/laughing the whole time. Seems unsincere to me.
His pockets looking light. So nows the time to apologize lol
Bro is selling his book under this video
Learn. Apologize sincerely. Move forward. Human.
Looking forward to Will’s team deleting negative comments to curate the responses narrative- go ahead— we all know you got a team of people doing it- lord knows you can afford to pay em.
The problem with continuous shame is it offers no opportunity for growth. Anyone who thinks that Will Smith needs more punishment is projecting their own insecurities. Which is understandable. But it also can eat you alive from the inside. Especially if you don’t allow for the opportunity to let go & forgive yourself and own your mistakes.
Took 3 months hahaha this guy
That was sweet, but elevate that apology. “Chris, I’m sorry. Would you forgive me? What can I do to pave the way to reconciliation?”
I was just listening to summer time the other day Will, I’ll always be a fan! I know you and Chris will work things out when the time is right. I can not wait Bad Boys 4!!
Hey man, you need to ditch that lady, she is eating your energy and you are not yourself. She is poison and she feeds on others energy. You can be fine without her man. She can't... ditch her
THIS IS SO DELAYED- LATE- DISINGENUOUS- AND REHEARSED.....You're CLEARLY reading and using KEY WORDS to affect your audience 🙄
You gotta let my boy get his lick back and then yall even🤷🏾‍♂️
Will, I hope you straightened out your son when he publicly said some to the effect "That is the way you do it".  That is not the way you do it.
Will.. we love you no matter what. It's human to act in ways we don't expect.. human nature is full of unexpected things.. but regardless .. you're still loved.. you are not a monster, you are human. Please don't keep apologizing to the masses of people who do things way worse than what you did. We love you and we love chris..  it's that simple. Stay blessed Will, keep your chin up, and STOP READING NEGATIVITY ON THE INTERNET... because the internet is a toxic society. For a healthy mind, focus on you and not what people say.   You probably wont ever read this but Will.. you dont need to convince me to still have love for my childhood/adulthood hero. With what little I have in money I will support everything you do buy buying tickets to your movies, because I support you!
Everyone makes mistakes…everyone.   Owning it, searching your soul and truly apologizing is the signature of a good person.
BS Selling a book and merchandise. Remember, the man is an actor, and this was just another role. Not a fan anymore.
I’m honestly just glad that he has finally made a vid speaking up about this. This vid is just so important, not only for him but for us as we can finally move on from this situation. I hope ppl will forgive him bc I’m sick of this situation being constantly brought up, like please let’s just move on and let the dude continue with his career cuz I for one look forward to him being more active online. Like I know what he did was wrong but the dude has clearly struggled and has had a rough couple of years.
Dude move on life continues you apologize and he’s not ready to accept that at least you apologized y’all should change chapters like grown man life continues peace and love
If you are serious, give back the award, offer to do some jail time, and donate your entire fortune to anger management programs. Without actions, this is just you reading something your publicist wrote for you.
I’d feel better about this if it wasn’t an overproduced multi-camera production.
Can we just all dislike this!!!
Could this be more cringe?
Is this an apology to Chris OR is this is a message to your fans, those fans that are disappointed of that crazy, irrational behaviour ??? Is this you trying to fix your brand, the image ?  We all make mistakes, and it takes courage to accept responsibility and genuinely change.  Still I am not sure if this about your image or about Chris. I hope this is real ..... time will tell !!!!  Chris really was a man by keeping the cool in such distorted reality, I am not sure how I would have reacted..... perhaps I would have kicked the sh*it out of you in return, which would have been as wrong as you did. Chris was a man by standing tall and cool. I am not sure how many of us could have behaved like Chris, honorable. Chris is an example of how to react in crazy sh*it like this. That is what is wrong with world today......  I do think that Chris needs time to reflect whether he will ever reconnect with you.  Trust is everything in human relationships. Here the trust is broken. He can forgive you and probably he will by judging his character. Trust is the glue to all relationships, and this has been broken and lost and to find it, it will take NOT words but action by behaviour, perhaps things will never be the same between you and him. Will, I wish you the best, as we all make mistake, I am right there with you. I just hope that this is real...... time will tell. Good Luck to you.
I thought I unsubscribed why is it still in my feed?
I'm happy to hear him in his own words in true sincerity. I'm hopeful we can all put that ugly day behind us and appreciate both of these men again.
i still dont believe in you
Until next time right?
I missed Will Smith❤
I am Extremely Proud of Will! Like he said...we are all human and make mistakes.
❤❤❤
We forgive u Will, Life, No one's perfect. We All make mistakes,  learn n grow.
Will- I apologize for the heat that I brought on my family  Translation- I’m sorry for the money we are losing now because of this…. Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
You're a good guy, Will.  A lapse of judgement doesn't change that. Thanks for taking ownership - take care.
Te queremos Willy.
Actor still be acting...
Proud of you Will, but I was so disappointed in you that night, it was horrible, but I’m glad you are apologizing. God bless you
Te queremos Willy.
PR manager work here. Dont make an edited video, do it on youtube live and then wel see how you react to the questions.
Someones worried about his career..
Trying to be a good guy wearing Wario's hat lol
❤️
I've got no sympathy for him. Men who throw anyone/thing under the bus to get a sniff of vageen are on par with stsipaR< and selifodeP<.  The first to flee and the first to betray. The first to succumb to their desperation and desires with consideration for the consequences of their actions only when held to account/and the pum-pum is denied.  There's a level of codependency that man can come back from, but when you cross into the territoy of willful tool/weapon of your master, that's the point of no return.   You can pretend to come back from that, but it's just excuses.  What? Your master demand you make an apology so she doesn't look as bad?  Dirt.
I forgive you brother, I am still a fan.
It takes a big man to admit when he’s wrong or been wrong. At first I thought this video was a plea for help as your career is on the line but after watching it, no, I believe you, I believe your sorry. I felt your apology was heartfelt and honest.
But its more than 5 minutes
Nope...
The smith family has abused the word healing. Its not healing. Yall need to be more practical in ur approach and less spiritual. Sorry but its the truth
Supported you from the jump Will #HesHuman
Will take your time. Those of us that love you like a brother appreciate you sharing. This is between you and Chris (and his family) and you all will get through this. You were out of character and this is why it was so shocking to the world. Time will heal and hopefully Chris can accept your apology and mend the relationship. True friendships survive moments like this.
good. now get divorce and get you self up again. you deserve it
Waayyy toooo late
La gente es hipócrita. Lo atacaron y ahora seguro muchos de esos están "perdonando a Will". Will ha de tener un montón de cosas dando vuelta en su cabeza como cualquier otra persona y lamentablemente se descargó como no debía, contra alguien que no tenía la culpa y justamente el chiste de Chris fue la gota que derramó el vaso para que explotara. Y ahora aquí está dando explicaciones de esto y lo otros y que estuvo mal. Bien por él si acepta su mal comportamiento, pero siento que lo hace más por lo que piense o diga la gente de él que por otra cosa... La gente se vienen a hacer los santos, pero bien que también tienen sus defectos y comenten muchos errores y no los veo haciendo un esfuerzo (al menos no a todos) por ser mejores de lo que fueron ayer.
Tá perdoado Will ❤️❤️
Good to have you back, Will. The reactions to that moment speaks only for the characters of those who reacted - not yours. You're as human as the rest of us and a better human than many of us. Keep centering yourself and pushing forward.
Get away from egghead bro she the cause of your downfall
Trying to save his career now lol
Also you didnt let me down.
This one is "Not Sorry".
Honestly, It took you 3 months to apologize?   It should have be said:   " Its extremely simple. Im sorry. I should never have done this to you. You never deserved this. If there is anything i can do to make up for it, i will try my best to repair the damage i have done."   Simple, honest, straight to point.  Edit: Typo.
I’m so sick of hearing about this. Every racist has an opinion as thou they are holier than thou. Wipipo carrying on like he murdered a bunch of people on live tv. They’re bigots every day and they never apologise let alone sincerely. Somewhere amongst all this bs is a woman a victim of misogynoir and that’s been completely erased. Misogynoir is a hell of a drug. Chris isn’t ready to talk? Him not shutting his mouth is what caused it. 🤦🏽‍♀️🙄 Two men centreing themselves in a subject about misogynoir. 🤮
WILL HE AINT REACHING OUT TO YOU.  HE SAID JUST THE OTHER WEEK THAT HE WILL TALK ONCE HE SEES A BIG CHEQUE.  PAY UP!!!    #WILLDACUCK
Will Smith has been suffering inside a lot over the years. I hope he's addressing it instead of supressing it
I love u, Will, you are human just like us we all have disgraceful moments as long as we learned from that moment all Will be well. Stay strong and funny
Youre awesome Will! Dont let this one thing get you down. Many were confused but things happen when you make swift decisions.   What I care about more is you and Chris as well as his family not having beef for this. Thats all.   Regardless of what people think just because of this you already proved that you are a great person.
Thanks for coming back, Will.  I've always been a huge fan of you, and will always continue to be. We all made mistakes in life man, so whoever says they never made any and are perfect, throw the first stone. No need to be ashamed, you made a mistake, recognized it, and now move on!
The word 'sorry' is said to express remorse or sympathy. The word 'sorry' has a personal essence in it. Whereas the word 'apology' is used in a formal tone and used when one has done something wrong. While being apologetic, one might or might not be sorry for what they did wrong.  PS - I'm a Will fan also.
Worthless, scripted, practiced apology.
That night didn't change a thing for me. It didn't ruin anything for me. I still watch Fresh Prince every day and still listen to your music. You didn't let me down at all. It's beyond time for people to let this go and move on. There's nothing else you can do. You've apologized to him twice and reached out to do it directly. You don't owe any of us anything. I believe there are people who have been waiting decades to see you do something that would give them a reason to knock you out of the spot you put yourself in with your talent and hard work. Decades of being a good dude didn't disappear in one night. There is no one who could take your spot. If that throne is empty, it's not because someone else is about to sit on it. It's just waiting for you to take your seat again.
Sorry but my view of Will Smith has been altered permanently.
I'm still an admirer of your work Mr. Smith and you still inspire as a person.  This too shall pass
4:50 Shame is good. Shame is a great reminder of what not to do again.
I would accept Will’s apologies and I truly believe that he feels bad about it…BUT  I’d never want him nowhere near me or my family because HE is one impulsive manchild who can react violently at any moment. Only long term therapy with lots of dedication and commitment will control that level of anger, not just apologies.
Will really needs normal people in his life.
I can say from experience that having to look back and say how did I get to that point is hard. Only in retrospect can I say I could have looked at those who would have been hurt and made a different choice. I feel for Will. I get it. You will come out of this. I still love your work and respect you.
well dang
H3H3 REACT TO THIS GARBAGE
LOL Such a "Karen" apology.
Fart sounds flffbbftt
Bro apologized through a QnA
Im with u Will and your darkest moment won't erase everything you've done over the years your real fans are still your fans 💯❤️
Booo this man!
IDK this kinda fell flat for me.
not a big deal imo
Will….I am praying for you and Chris. I am lifting you up. Having made my own big assed mistakes…. I can relate to what you must be going through. Stay strong and focus on your continued healing. We all have trauma that manifests in different ways. The ONLY difference is that you are having to experience yours in a very public way. I support you and your healing. There is purpose even in this. You will become the best version of yourself because of it. I send you all of the light, love, and compassion within my being. ❤️❤️❤️
I think for me as a fan, it was disappointing to see this kind of behavior. It surprised me how much it disappointed so many of this generation of fans. We have seen you grow and grow up. We have watched you rise from obscurity to become someone who could inspire and encourage growth in others. Everyone makes stupid rash decisions when emotion takes over. I hope to see more of your light, love and joy in this world.
Every single person in this comment section has made mistakes which are as bad or worse. We are all out there trying our best and sometimes get it wrong.
Nah will, you took too long, they called you an actual sheep on stage lol
I wondered when he'd be back again for some more ego fix. Again all about him. Funny how he says there is no part of him that thinks the actions were right as if talking about someone else.. odd!  Just makes me realize how much you need to separate the actor from the man who can't function without his audience.
You’re only human, we love you Will!
didn't think this would turn into a huge deal i just thought it was funny at first
After that altercation, honestly I feel disgusted with u. But when u say that youre still human, then I realised that what u said is true. Human makes mistakes. So I throw my hate and love u back. I try not to watch your movies but I cant. U r still my favorite actor. Love u Mr Smith
I didn't even think it was that bad, good on you for making this video and apologising. also, nice beard.
"it's been a min...over the last few months, ive been doing a lot of thinking and personal work..."   If that was a text i wouldn't send it...
You really upset us let us down
Aur reh sadguru ke saath 😹😹
I'm not convinced. He has to do better
There was no complexities or anything that’s just the real you bro be a man man up and own it be like yeah I’m like that and be done
We all make mistakes! Hopefully Chris will see that and gives you the opportunity to apologize directly to him (face to face). Good luck Will and I hope that you learn something out of all this situation!  God Bless!
We still love you man. All we ask was for apology.
I would be more proud of him I'd he didn't let his spouse lead the family and prompt him to becoming a weak minded individual, at the moment, to cause Chris to have to deal with the  Humiliation...Will, all the videos you have done in the past about leading and raising up, setting an example...lost validation.  Work on yourself and drop the bad apple from your tree..u said it yourself...you can't make her happy...
I love you Will. Time heals. Take it easy, don’t be too hard on yourself. Everything should be fine now.
A sorry video now will smith is a real YouTuber
I think he's sincere.
Weak response take ownership. A simple I let you down I let myself down I’m sorry would have sufficed. PR teams scripting lines here not an honest and humble acceptance of guilt.
Respect to Will. I'm still rocking with you from one human to another...
The apology was good... In my eyes this one incident never diminished the great legacy of Will Smith He is still one of our GOATs
Should of kept your hands to yourself. You’ve made your bed, now lay in it.
You showed your real face that movement stupid now you are regretting. You are not eligible for the award after your stupidity.
Homeboy straight up looks like he's gotta firing squad on the other side of that camera
Hey Will - read The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi. Take a red pill and realise you in a bad place and no one (supposedly close to you) are really even trying to help you.   That book will help you brother. You need to learn some home truths about the one-time fairer sex, and there's one place your gonna get it. The Rational Male, Rollo Tomassi. Get after it.
we love you uncle will
Don’t ever say or talk about being a loving better and caring person you don’t deserve that black on black crime in America and you are proof of that
Still not a fan of you anymore. You would never have done that if Chris was white.
I stand with Will Smith! #CLM ✊
Imagine making a youtube channel to apologise vs doing it on the news where most eould see it.
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 still the KING
We love you Brotha. Even The Greatest of Men have bad days. The way we handle those bad off days is what makes Great men Really Great.
Will, please know that what this really demonstrated was the toxic relationship you are in and the hurt you are suffering from the result of it. You deserve better for yourself, to which I know you truly believe in delivering light and love, but you need to place yourself with the people who bathe you in that light and love, not fans, not sycophants, hand over the coals and He will place diamonds in your hands
Will if you're serious about making amends with your literal life-long fans, I mean I been watching you since elementary school, then the first thing you should do is apologize to Chris.
Man I appreciate you being that open and genuine. I felt the part about letting people down as a central trauma. You’re a good man bro.
Proud of you - thank you. We aren’t perfect people
please don't let other tell you how you should be. Do what you know is right even when people look down on you. You are an individual first and foremost even if you are a celebrity.
tbh it wasnt that deep
Nah.
Leave...her...now...🎩
A genuine apology from the heart. I've always been a fan of Will and I hope Chris can forgive him and they can move on.
Bun Chris - what Will did was right
Its not our choice in if Will is forgiven. That's up to Chris.
Be gentle with yourself and do all you can to make Chris whole.
I stop being a fan of Will after that moment. A lot of people are praising this man's apology. But he disrespected another black man on National Television smh. I wish him the best but I can and will not support that.
World is just very unforgiving nowadays. You made 1 big mistake in 20years of people watching, thats a 1000 less then most common people. I understand that because your a celebrity people look up ar you, but how you got treated over that moment feels wrong. That problem only needs to be talked about with Chris. You’ve brought millions of smiles to the world and i genuinely hope you continue doing so!
The mind of a Libra.  We think, think and think. Then think some more. But we don't think in the most crucial moments. It's almost like we black out during our reactions. And we have to live with the outcome with it's negative or positive. So I know it's still constantly playing through wills mind. And it will continue to play in his mind until he speaks directly to Chris. As a Libra/heavy thinker i'm pretty sure will has been beating himself up about this since it happened. Anyway I wish you the best. Your still one of the few role models I have.
im glad your working on you and eventually be that will we love and remember. with that said the only question i think people want to know is why were you laughing first then just switched? thats the only one you didnt answer.
#Respect
Seems like the typical apology video. Even starts out with the sigh lol. Nothing about this apology is genuine
ratio lmao
Love you Will.❤❤
I believe him. I think this was a hard video for him to do and I still have his back. I  think this was not who he really is and I'm thinking that there were other things going on behind the scenes the contributed to his actions. Things that we in the public don't know. Because let's be honest. We Love Will Smith but we don't really know the man himself. I hope that he can spring back from this because he is a great actor and I do think he is a good man. He has all my love and support.
what hurts the most is that we all knew will was capable of better. we all have moments of weakness and it seems will had been under a lot of pressure. that's no excuse and there is no excuse. we can only try to move forward warts and all
Why does everything need a public apology
If you did it on your own accord, why did you laugh at first until you saw Jadas reaction? Admit that she’s toxic and leave that woman!
Hey man, we all make mistakes, we all don't have the courage to stand up and take responsibility. You have shown so many how to do it with class and dignity. Big fan for many years. Welcome back.
Take a tremendous amount of energy for a man to apologize, no matter how you feel towards the man it takes a lot to own up and express yourself for somebody who was in the wrong and showed a shameful side of yourself. Hate it or love it. we've all had our demons, our yin and yangs. Own up too it and keep marching forward in the end. Keep doing the work. Let's go champ
Honestly this felt fake, I’m wanting to believe it’s remorseful but I can’t shake the feeling this is a desperate save my career move.
We HERE Will... Ride together!! for life!!
Like they didn't remove every negative comment in this section
And in a nutshell he's always leading by example. Life get's wild, I think it's hard to separate emotionally someone coming after your spouse as a personal attack. He didn't handle it well, but I understand. Mistakes happen in life and people at times get caught up. As an adult he's making all the inroads to make amends and again set the tone to do what's correct to acknowledge and take responsibility for his actions. I have nothing but respect, and compassion for him doing so.
If Chris forgives you, then I'll forgive you. Otherwise, imo your still someone who walked up on stage, committed a crime, and basically got away with it. Any ordinary civilian would've been tackled and put behind bars that same night.
Maybe a face to face apology with Chris might've been a lot more better than having to put on makeup and expensive cameras surrounding ya.  Just saying...
Again Will, divorce already. Normal people do not understand this, we pity you.
Who cares, none of this matters at all. Move on.
Honestly I don't care what Will Smith says. My parents unlike his taught me Actions Speaks Louder Than Words. Take a really close look at Will Smiths actions just over the last year but mute what he says. See if you learn something. Don't get me wrong... Good Actor but Bad Person
Will did nothing wrong
Fake news, just doing damage control not genuine at all 👎 given how long it took “it’s been a minute” yeah too damn long kick rocks Will
Apologizing is getting rid of that toxic woman that is bringing down not building you up!
We all make mistakes.  Jesus said who is not a sinner can throw the 1st stone( at the prostitute)  Chris please accept his forgiveness and find a way to respond in an inspiring way  Will,it takes alot to ask for forgiveness . Let this experience serve and not destroy you
Self centered, pathetic, cringe worthy, annoying, just shut the hell up and take some time off. Your ego is the reason why you got yourself in this mess and it's your ego that's making it worse. SMITH'S just need to take some time off the screens. Take an extended holiday, do some charity work, like actual work rather than take photos with a shovel in a deprived area, then post it on your social media. Maybe go to your roots, take a leaf out of Chappelle's book. Just stop forcing your fakeness and empty filled crap on the world.
Why does he sound like he is reading a teleprompter??🤔
Who knew a professional actor would take acting tips from youtube appology videos
We all make mistakes but remember... #Yahweh (God) loves us dearly ❤️❤️❤️   and that Our Lord and Savior #YahshuaTheMessiah (#JesusChrist) 👑 want us to repent from sin 🔥 and walk in #Faith ✨ with Him and receive the #HolySpirit 🕊️ #EternalLifeNow. 🙌🙌🙌  Matthew 16:26 (KJV)   said it best 😉  For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  So with that being said, "Store up your #Treasures 🥇🏆  in #Heaven" now  (Matthew 6:19-21)  before it's too late! Amen! Because #YahwehIsSalvation and remember, #GodLovesYou dearly! HalleluYAH. ❤️🙏🙏🙏❤️
Un gran abrazo Will, eres grande, no cualquiera sale y da la cara, aunque tú reacción no fue la mejor, fue la de un ser humano defendiendo a los suyos y la actitud de Kris no fue la mejor y sin embargo no tuvo los pantalones para salir y ofrecer disculpas por su comportamiento, eso marca la diferencia entre tú y él, te mando un gran abrazo 🥰
I hope you do better for yourself will I'm proud of you
So glad you're back! I talk about you every week hoping you'll post on one of your social media platforms! We all make mistakes, you've apologized and now it's time to move forward. Thanks for the apology and all of your hard work throughout the years of entertaining us! We Love You....Keep Going! ❤🙏
Keep your head up Will. We love your work and as a huge fan I know what it’s like to make big mistakes but of course not on a high scale like yours. No matter how famous or well known someone is they make mistakes it’s just human nature.
If you’re going to sincerely apologize why tf are you posting it on YouTube…
So sincere 🤢🤮
This video is a step in the right direction, just keep going. Respect.
you had a mad moment, it's now time to heal.
This seems so disingenuous. The water bottle with the label facing the camera. The production of it all. Why did you say anything at all about the conversation you had with Chris? There is nothing sincere about this you’re just trying to bandaid your image so people will hire you again.
You can't be remorseful without being ashamed.  Shame is the first thing you feel when you realize that you were wrong and that you've hurt someone.
saludos desde venezuela , pais de valores ,y  amor al projimo..
Still got love for this man. Keep it pushing and keep your head up. This too shall pass
Will your apology is accepted
Weird way to send an authentic apology, almost like it's meant to appease the fans and mend a tarnished public image vs actually apologizing to the person you have wronged. Not to mention the whole "I don't remember a thing I went fuzzy" 🤣 That's the equivalent of "I was hacked" or "I took ambient when I tweeted that" an "apology" without accepting responsibility for your actions is not an apology at all. 🙄
Soooo does this mean Chris may take your wife’s name back in his mouth again?
I understand you really Don't Wana do this and to be honest you deserve another chance 👍🏻👍🏿👍
Awwww Will. We miss you sir!!! Love you. God's grace over your life. Forgive yourself and keep being A-FREAKING AMAZING!!!! We still support you. We all make mistakes.
An actor stays an actor
(SpongeBob narrator voice) 4 months later…
Will, divorce that witch before she takes your whole damn soul!
Listen twin brother from another mother. You are who you  said, only human. You have apologized and  open to talk to Chris and his family personally. Nothing more you can do. Time to move on and return to work. You will get backlash but just take it in stride and continue to serve with your talent. Nobody died, it was as acknowledged a lapse in judgment. If we were perfect, the world be too. Hope you smile again soon. Take care twin bro( we were born same day and year). God Bless.  Warren Dobbins Jr
So it took you MONTHS to put out a 5 minute apology? Really? Even my toddler apologizes after a few minutes. Cmon dude, time to grow up.
I wonder how much time, effort, and money was put in by how many top PR firms to write, film (three cameras?), and edit this.
“Im trying not to think of myself as a piece of sh**.”  Messing up is easy, but to separate your character from your mistakes is difficult. We’re human and often times we beat ourselves up over and over. We can be our own toxicity sometimes. More people have to learn this so we can grow
I hope one day all you hollywood people would realize that Yahweh is the truth the one and only God and spread that message and stop selling your souls for money and fame give God the glory and praise Yeshua his son because with all the knowledge and wisdom y’all seem to possess y’all still seem to be as fools get in order my guy that’s why yo life is so chaotic I hope you’re able to receive this message
not too many contracts lately, uh? do not blame the devil. you have problems and your family also. do not focus in retake your career, focus in something more important: make your life be worth and save your kids.
Contracts are hard to find, eh?  Sorry, but I don't buy it. Not sincere...
He looks stressed out of his mind. I hope he gets better.
Will, we love you regardless of your faults and flaws. You are human first, a celebrity second. Take your time, do what you have to do for yourself. Heal and move on💙 The world just needed a reminder to not get fresh or F with the Fresh Prince 👑 💪🏾 PERIOD!😉😘
When there is the slightest lie in an apology everything that you say goes down the drain your words mean nothing.
I can only imagine the staff filming him in his house or wherever this is, and all the after process and editing, so fabricated and fake
I hope you give Chris 20 million for his troubles, that's a real apology. Words on YouTube for your fans are not an apology (my two cents).
He’s apologizing to his bank. He’s morally bankrupt. Half of y’all wouldn’t forgive your neighbor but wanna forgive some elite stranger you see in tv.
Brrrrhhhhh
Hello
I’d love to hear from Chris! We don’t need an apology. I believe Will and his sincerity.
We all make mistakes. Keep living and learning my brother peace and blessings always.
👎👎👎👎
Uncle will we miss you 🖤
Everyone makes mistakes. This mistake doesn’t define you. I hope Chris can find what it takes to forgive and move forward soon.
Good job, Will. I'm proud of you. I'm a huge fan and I was extremely disappointed and disgusted by what happened. I'm glad you are working on your mental health and anger management. You're a real man because you admit where you were wrong and you're sorry.  It's over, everyone should move on, now.
Move forward ⏩
Will starting to look like a light skin Rick Ross
After 5 month? GET LOSS!
This was right.
Well at least his acting is still on par because  that's all this is. And you SHOULD be ashamed of yourself
Reincarnation will help.  Better life next time. Try to be less of a punk.
Please forgive yourself
We all make mistakes. It's nice seeing you again, I hope you're healing well. ♥️
Why is this a public video.   If you're gonna apologies to the guy, that apologise to the guy.  Kinda feels like this video was to save face in The eyes of the public.
I love you Will, I’m glad to see you back. 💙
We all have made mistakes, it's just no cameras around to capture our mistakes, in effect we can address it privately versus publicly. Mr. Smith is  big enough to admit his mistakes, he is smart enough to learn from them, and he is strong enough to correct them. Keep praying everyone.
Love this. We all make mistakes. Owning up to your mistake and endeavoring to mend the chasm illustrates you are doing the real work of evolving. As a father and someone who works with kids...Thank you for doing this.
Sending so much love and prayers to you! Forever a Fan! I pray you heal from your trauma and know it's ok not to please everyone. I really wish people would stop blaming Mrs Pinkett-Smith. Bless you and your whole family! 🙏 ❤️
It started good and sounded genuine until 2:53 there it is..
Better late than never. He seems honest. But then again he's a good actor. He can be grateful that Chris is such a great guy and forgives him.
That was good Will. I accept your apology for coming forward with us.
Thank you for doing this. I'm sure it wasn't easy.
I mean this is a terrible apology. He just talks about himself and does a half arsed sorry
This reeks of trying to save his career
Thanks Will. We are humans. ❤
Can we forgive him? No, but we can forget. Only Chris can forgive him.
It's not us to forgive,  its chris.
Your only Human man. Godspeed and let the Haters Hate !
Man Idk why people still on this situation Will just comeback already, it happened we all make mistakes people just gotta learn the the lesson from situation and move on
what about the statement of your son: "That´s how we do things!"? Care to comment?
We're all humans bro. I still love you and things I've learnt from watching you. learning lessons and humbling moments in all. Everyone can act like they're above it. Not learning from mistakes is bad . You are trying like us all.. God's richest blessings
Me...I'm hanging on.
Luv u will!!!❤
never lost me I understand you on a metaphysical terrain sharing some of the same energies so carry on please🙏🏾
He is one of the worlds greatest emoters
Thanks will this reminded me to unsubscribe.
🙏🏾
I don't believe a single word of this. This just sounds like someone from a PR department wrote up something for Will Smith to say, and he's reading off a teleprompter off screen.
Travis Scott apology is better than this
I’m sure you actually are sorry after all the backlash and all the projects you’ve now lost. But in my mind and many others minds you showed who you really are that night. A bully who puts on a front of being a wholesome person.
will smith didnt have to do this but i respect this man
God forgives so we can too
It's quite strange that he uploaded a apology video when his next movie is going to release
🤡
This means more than you know. I dont know if you will ever read this Will, but on the off chance that you do. Thank you.
Will, people have a lot to say about this for a lot of different reasons.  This path you are on, and the challenges that you must face and grow from, is yours, as it is for all of us.  Chris will speak for himself, somehow, the universe had this in the cards for him as well.  It is evident who was in the wrong here.  News flash, we have ALL done something wrong in life, some worse then others.  Yet we are all human, and honestly, not designed biologically for celebrity, or even the attention and information that is born out of social media and the internet.  We all have our battles to overcome in its own time.  GodSpeed brother!  Live in spirit and let life unfold as it WILL!!!
My brother. Pls don’t do this.
we s´til loveu man
All any decent man can do is ask for forgiveness and all any man with grace can do is accept their apology. It doesn't do anyone any good to hold a grudge in their heart.
What I want to know why you were defending her? She couldn't care less about you. You are better than her. Don't let that lady tell you how to act.
Who has not made a mistake in life? Well i guess its not the same because we are not famous..
Bela atitude Will 👏🤝🇧🇷
Took THIS forever to apologize? "I was fogged out" 😂
The comedic way in solving this is only by a the ROAST of WIll Smith. period.
💙💙
You’re a very good person, Will. I wish you healing ❤️
When someone famous makes an apology, some in the world consider it "fake" and "insincere". To me, he was sincere. Can't say the same for others that don't own up to their mistakes.
Too little, too late.
u ar gud man
The funny thing is that you've been on my mind a lot over the last few days. I don't look up to celebs..but I look up to you.
Brother. Real Men do Real things.  Courage is action in the face of fear or ridicule. This took courage.  I love your career. I love the way you have navigated from "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble" ""Charlie Mack (First Out of the Limo)"....still one of my first songs, to Will 2K, and all your movies and you being open and allow us all on your journey.  I always look at you as the hommie who made it.   Thank you for that, thank you being vulnerable, thank you for being open and honest.  As a long time fan I humbly and respectfully accept your apology.  "There but for the Grace of God go I." I will leave with this.   "The only way that we can live, is if we grow. The only way that we can grow is if we change. The only way that we can change is if we learn. The only way we can learn is if we are exposed. And the only way that we can become exposed is if we throw ourselves out into the open. Do it. Throw yourself.” ― C. JoyBell C.  Semper Fi
I just want to thank you for coming back Will I still look up to you and my life has been really changing. This has helped me and I hope someone can help you. Your still a great man in my eyes!!!
I’m glad he didn’t do this on red table talk. It would’ve seemed more disingenuous.
I know it took some time for you to process all of this but it is good that you have taken time to apologize to Chris and to the public we all admire you and wish you and your family the very best God bless. 🙏💕
A proper amends talks about the work done to ensure that doesn't happen again, and the question, what can I do o to make it right? Then doing whatever atonement the offended person asks of them.
Bad acting, again.
How can 1 unfortunate situation / mistake / bad decision ..washes off the rest of good impact that you had in life so as you said you are just human like the rest of us and show me a person who has not make a single bad decision in their lives .
Will my love is unconditional
Respect.
It wasn’t a “complex” and full of “nuance” moment Will, it was simply unchecked ego on the world stage. A bit of shame is good…
I love you Will. It is like you said you are human. Everybody can make mistakes that you never thought you would make. ❤️❤️ There are so many evil people in this world, you are all love.  ❤️ Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Bigg hug to you Natascha
One of the most impactful things you could do at this point is to tell Chris to please, put your wife's name back into his mouth
Respect. Will Smith you the man again =)
What is missing here is HUMILITY... Rehearse... We'll wait...
Sorry but no,,,, you’ve gone too far. Nobody is interested
You finally came out and gave an apology after you were able to take the time to heal yourself but everyone this  hurt has carried the pain. This should have been done sooner
We all make mistakes and shame is toxic.  To err is human, to forgive divine. Embrace your humanity.
3,5/10 apology video
Great acting will! This will def get you nominated for another Emmy
Way to own the conversation.
I personally was never mad at you. Thank you for apologizing to everyone. I send you light and love! Keep on keeping on!
it's time we start talking about toxic feminiminty. You need to leave that destructive relationship if you really wants to do some self work.
"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."   .. stands out as I look at my own glaring list of wrongs committed towards others while in that same mind zone.
Sounds like its his first time reading this script
Lmao what a dork
He has gained weight
I never stopped loving and supporting you ! In that moment ain’t no telling what I would of did. You’re still a hero; don’t beat yourself up !
2:23 🧢
Will, to me you still seem traumatized from what happened, my heart goes out to you. I can see you are doing a lot of therapy work on your issues. Remember YOU are bigger and more important than your brand. Know that if you stop the work mid stream, those issues will come up again. You've apologized to Chris & Family, now it's up to him to speak with you personally. Keep doing the Work Buddy, we all have our demons to eliminate*Peace ✌🏽
Your human it happens we correct ourselves and keep it moving
For two decades+, you were one of the coolest actors I knew.  You are right, you are human and you lost your cool right there. I have as well done stupid things without thinking, and regret what I did, but really... things will never be the same, even after forgiveness.
4 months to apologize? WOW felt so much true haha 😂
Being human among perfect folk is tough. I hope all get past this. I hope Chris and Will can do something together privately.
Ah, common apology video.
Will... we will forget, but the internet won't. May your apology be accepted from the one who needs to recieve it the most.
Isn it late for this?
I say just let him smack you back. Then you’d be even at the very least.
Remorseful without shame. I hear that.  We have all done some cringeworthy things,  we just don't have as big an audience as you.  I still got love for u😪😍
I’ve always been a Will Smith fan and loved watching RTT. I grew up watching fresh prince. But man, I lost so much respect when that happened. It just made me sad.  I’m glad he has been taking this time to reflect and heal and reach out to reconcile to everyone affected.
Can we just get a bad boys 4
LAUGH OUT LOUD.
Cut a check to all injured parties - all better
I hope you and Chris will be able to talk face to face soon. Apologizing is the best first step to healing.
Ryan garcia is not ready for Gervonta davis
It's all good Will! You made a mistake and you made a genuine apology.
...le jour où Putin présentera ses excuses comme ça au peuple ukrainien
Will Smith, you're a good man, please don't hold on to things or people that don't deserve you.
Everyone deserve forgiveness.
Hope will and Chris get along again
Na u did good, thank you for the memes and laughter.
So proud of you Will
Deluded
A very boomer apology but it was probably the right move. He was respectful at this point lol. I haven't seen any memes yet but I know it'll become one
Your a MAN and MEN SMACK others for DISRESPECT so DON'T SWEAT IT will...!!!!
Still it's all pretty much about himself.
Hey Will I’m no one but I’m praying for you sir. I hope you healing.
to apologize you have to be a human wish you are
Too little too late brotha. You destroyed your career that night and I truly feel sorry for you. I was all ways a huge fan of yours but your actions that night were  Unexcusable.
That's all we can do Will.. ""accept what happen, be accountable for it.. and move forward do the self work you think you need to do and come out the otherside better for it. Yes you we're wrong I was angered by it.. But You don't need to continuously be in front of the firing squad? Gees
Took you long enough to remember the script huh?
Will I MISSED YOU achi!!  This was tough can only imagine, but THIS 2 SHALLL PASS!  Sending HEALING prayers your way, be encouraged🖤
Why didn't you make this apology straight after it happened? Your trying to get your name back in the headlines. Pathetic.
Will, apologies accepted !!!!  From the public 😊 time to move on please!!!!! On to the next  💥  Ps:  we all do make mistakes and I believe your part is done. you have apologised  now it’s up to Chris . He can take his time and that’s okay 👍 but you got to move on too sir…… you still got a lot to give the world 🌍 xx
I still love you Willard.  Now let’s move forward.
Good job, Will! All you really did was just pressure Chris into talking to you.
I hope all the people who blindly stood up for Will’s stupidity are eating their words now. This was wild af and should have never been tolerated or justified at all…
Omg not the sigh in the beginning lol
There but for the grace of God I go...
Apologizeing with a Wario hat is crazy
Just leave your toxic person.
Well, at least this is a better youtube apology than most apology videos.
Your actions were wack and you deserve to be held responsible
Kudos to Will for finally saying something. He seemed sincere and I think we all know he messed up bad. Especially Will.
This apology is 4 MONTHS TOO LATE...This is just an massive LATE PR stun to get back in Hollywood's good graces...SMH
🗣I missed you welcome back Will💓
Well said I think. Just a person that made a mistake
Is this a play to force Chris to accept the apology?
Is it just me, or does he look like he's dressed for golfing?
Will you are a good person, I pray for you and hope that you heal in an impactful way. Keep being a light in the world bro🖖🏾
A real man no doubts, love you bro
🙎🏾‍♀️
I caught COVID December 9th and my birthday was two days later, the same day my COVID symptoms intensified. I downloaded your book on Audible and listened to it while Sick and Alone ,quarantined in my bedroom. And it was one of the things outside of pure prayer that got me through those awful 9 days in hell.  Your audible version of you narrating it lit up my imagination. I appreciate you for your life and service.  Thanks again.
Amen🙏🏽Brother🌟 Let's all live in peace....✨
🙏🏽🥺💕💕
Apologize to Paul Rodriguez Sr, you treated him like crap when you filmed Ali
Is there anyone in this comments section that never messed up epicly at at least once in their life?
You are not the villain You are not the villain You are not the villain You are not the villain You are not the villain You are not the villai. You are not the villain
We good Boo! We've all been there mentally or physically We've all been there. Much love! This was nice!
Much love Will! Don't condemn  yourself we are human meaning ain't nobody perfect. You are still the fresh prince and I will forever support you and hope to one day meet you it will be an honor
BETA
alot of respect was lost that day. A youtube apology isnt bringing that back.
Will smith is “being difficult”
Props to you fresh prince! What matters, is what we do today and moving forward. Were all human. And we all go thru trials and failures. Big up man. Proud a ya
Will you are a good man. People make mistakes. Only God can judge you. Now let’s make some movies. This is so old now. Let it go. And thank God Chris didn’t press charges. Both of you guys will be alright.
I think we are all waiting for Chris answer. 🙂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA hahahahahahaha - gasp - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I’m not a fan of will smith as person but this video genuinely feels sincere and unrehearsed. Couple of times I could hear the shackeyness in his voice. This man looks like he had the world on his shoulders. I hope nothing happens to him because he looks like he is going through a lot
Approved!!
And we all think Tom Cruise is the weirdest celebrity with ties to Scientology.
He learned the arts of YouTube. Even had the sign and weird talking.
No need to be sorry for being human Will 💯
One thing people aren't factoring is the fact that he is a human being who made a mistake.  The moment you act as if you haven't made a mistake in your life and are walking around as a perfect being, it is then you'll be humbled.  It is on Chris to forgive and move on when he's ready.  We can't sit here talking about canceling anybody because that would be the same as judging and condemning someone and there's only one who has the final say on our lives here on earth.
Forreal who care F them Will keep being you. You don’t owe anybody anything in this life
I feel like The Fresh Prince was something truly amazing, but then I look at Will Smiths kids and I realize he is not that great a person. To have kids so lost and mixed up and confused about who and what they are that is a major failure on both Will and Jadas part..... Terrible parents
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Amen. I'm so glad he did this. It gave us all closure and mistakes happen. Glad he didn't hide anything behind this apology. Just an apology.
These new apologies and sentiments of remorse that you share with us, honour yourself.
Nope.
So many ppl called this BS. He would disappear for a few weeks then say he worked on himself and then go on the im a new man tour. I’m not buying it. It hasn’t even been that long yet and he’s making videos like he’s had all this time to reflect. GFY W.S.
Bad Boys 4 may be happening,time for a apology.
You are officially youtuber. Made an apologized video.  Hahahahaa
Interesting...
Man Chris don’t want to hear this you embarrassed him for life let it go and move on
He is known for taking a brick to retaliate, so... expect a brick
We still love you Will 🧡😊
You deserve respect for taking the courage to step up and apologize, especially because so much time has passed and you still chose to apologize instead of choosing the easy way out and just trying to forget the topic. We're all humans and we all make mistakes, and sure, you're a very famous human, but still a human, so you should be allowed to make some mistakes as well. Fame sounds like a good thing at first glance, but when you make mistakes as a famous person, that fame will amplify those mistakes by a surreal amount, making each of them hurt way more than they normally would. Stay strong mate, I hope you'll get well soon!
Should of happened a lot sooner.. can’t blame Chris for not being ready since it took 3 months to finally apologized. If you knew it was wrong you should of reached out sooner. Public outlash must be hard to accept and finally eat your ego to say sorry.
Will Smith, I am French, If you shouldn't have done this act at the ceremony, I think you're still a great person with a good spirit as well as a great actor. So yes, if this moment was unwanted for you as well as for Chris and all of course, I think it was too much restriction from the Academy to you but in despite of that you accept this hard decision for your career and you even apologizes yourself. It is a prouve  how much you are a nice person indeed as well as great actor always in my opinion. We are all human, keep courage and positive always.
basically  what he is trying to say is :  "Hollywood please don't let me without a job"
You're right. "Sorry" isn't sufficient. You should be in jail.
......this was difficult to watch.
Q AND A apology ain’t worth a dime
We will always love u will😉
UNCLE PHIL
Honorable.
Months it took you months, smh.
Body language guys will be on this like flies on 💩 but good for Will. I'm sure this has been weighing heavy and great way to do this!! Answering the straight tough questions, aw man. Hopefully You and Chris can come out of this together as friends and maybe even closer because you guys can make some good content off of all this.
Too late. Hurting his career now he's "sorry" ya: sorry he's losing millions in opportunities.
I really respect Will for this well said and heartfelt apology. It takes a big man to come out and own up to his actions and apologise. He needs to forgive himself and learn from the situation and now move on. Continue being a good man that we know and love and being an awesome role model to his family and his fans. Always remember who you are and yes we are all human and we all make mistakes.
Dislike button here 👎
Welcome back Will you will always be my favorite celebrity because you are so honest, upfront and real. this is another example of that. looking forward to the future, PS its not just you that should apologise, dont take it all on your own shoulders xx
No respect for you sorry. It's been so long and you're apologizing to him now, seriously?  23k dislikes on this moment lol upd already 97k xD
Sending you positive vibes as you work on yourself. I loved your book, so I know you like all of us are working through stuff. Lots of people been snapping post COVID lockdown. Keep moving forward, keep getting help, keep working on your self
We all make mistakes. But reaching out to Chris and Chris’ family should be the number one focus; not us. Relentless effort to reach out and speak to that guy man to man.
We'll never forget what happened. Chris did nothing wrong
Will I’m Carl, It takes a man to show remorse! We are NOT god to judge so don’t seek public acceptance! Love yourself even when you hate to! Hope you see this message and I pray you well brother! Hold your head up and keep living and making mistakes,that just mean god has favor on you to get better!  -Forgiven-
Be a man till the end. This is bad video. Shame. Cry like Zinchenko. Booooo
i do not forgive you
Your still are fresh Prince 👑
Nah. Still a sociopathic narcissist married to a sociopathic narcissist.
Slow walk in ✅ Long sigh ✅ Overly edited ✅
You take it easy on yourself, we are all human… it’s only a mistake if you don’t learn from it!!! Being honest and up front is best way to bounce back!!! I never thought less of you… sending lots of prayers and love your way!!! 💖💖💖
U
Will Smith always have tried to be transparent but with that transparency came criticism, it takes true character to fall and get back up.
Proud! Great moment of a person trying to get better always!
3 months for an apology is quite a long time but fair play considering he didn't have to and could've just moved on. 👏
2:33 - "There's no part of me that thinks that's the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults". My guy, he's a COMEDIAN !!! What disrespect? What Insult? That's what comedians do! And they do MUCH worst.  I do respect the message he tried to put out though. Good on him.
I mean we are all humans and make mistakes. This doesn't defined you it was just one terrible moment that people are going to use and micro analyze for the time being. I just hope you make peace with yourself and don't let this get you down for too long. Love you, ❤️. Proud of you for taking this step.
STOP ACTING LIKE YOU'RE REALLY SORRY, YOU ARE NOT!! IF YOU WERE YOU WOULD HAVE WAITED TO TALK TO CHRIS PRIVATLY RATHER THAN MAKE THIS VIDEO!!!
I appreciate your courage in coming forward and speaking about this, taking responsibility for your actions, apologizing and self reflecting and doing your best to balance the feeling of remorse while dong your best to keep feeling ashamed at bay, its hard and we are human, we make mistakes, we are resilient and we have choice to allow ourselves to be compassionate with ourselves while also taking responsibility for our actions ... As Brene Brown says..“If you put shame in a petri dish, it needs three ingredients to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence, and judgment. If you put the same amount of shame in the petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can’t survive."
I was disappointed but still love you Will
LAME.
IF YOU CARED YOU'D GIVE ME MONEY (NOT CAUSE I CARE I JUST WANT MONEY THANKS DADDY)
I never have believed in judgment based on your worst moments! Glad to see the apology. Wish it would have came soon. But the healing process is different for each. Salute to all your accomplishments including this one...you could have easily chosen silence
I’ll wait for Chris to accept his apology
Thats whats up G ✊🏾
I believe you’re flawed like any other person, and at this point it’s between you and Chris
YOU ARE SO DISSAPOTING
Three months is way too long for this to feel genuine. Also, your kids reveled in your bad behavior. No need to apologize to them.
Sincere or not, everyone should have a chance to apologize or discuss their actions. I think he handled this tactfully and to the best of his ability, and given this pedestal we put celebrities on, this was a humanizing and very real moment. With that said...why is your shoe untied in this video Will?
Just came to dislike
I think this is more about salvaging his career than it is genuine remorse.
YOU ARE DONE lol He did an apology on YouTube so he can make money out of the video.
🤣
Sending all the love, Will.
I will always be a Will fan, everyone makes mistakes but most people acting like they're perfect when they probably done worse in their life, get back to being great Will, people already on the next piece of drama, can't wait to see Bad Boys and your YouTube post...We love you Will
Takes courage to admit you're  wrong and humble yourself.
He’s going to start a talk show out of this
lol
I love you Will Smith.  Just know that everyone is not judging you harshly over the incident.  I hope you can forgive yourself and move on with your life.  💖
WORD TRANSLATION HE'S NOT READY TO TALK-DIDN'T ANSWER
Wow he's a good actor! I almost believed you were sorry for what you did not for losing your career!
Noice.
At this point I can respect him as a great actor and as a person he’s a great actor
Welcome back Will.  I still have much admiration , respect and  love for you as an actor BUT most importantly, as a man and a human being.
Aquí los que vienen del perfil de Phillip Chu Joy dx
Good job Sir
YOU DISHONER THE NAME SMITH!!! MY FRIENDS DADS SISTERS DOG LAST NAME IS SMITH AND I FEEL SO OFFENDED THEY HAVE TO SHARE A LAST NAME WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!
In one moment, there was an actor who I deeply respected and cherished with how much he gave to me as a person who deeply appreciates his gifts to the world whether it be acting, singing, writing or what ever he contributed to some of the joy in my life, and took every last ounce of that away with such horrific behavior I had assumed was well below him. It forever changes for me every movie I so dearly loved, every song I would sing to, and every contribution he gave to the world when I see or hear him in that tremendous catalog he has produced. My question to him is, "What can you do to recover from what you have taken away so much from people like me who gave you what you had?" I want to hear that answer Mr. Smith.
Will, espero muito que você fique bem, tudo que acontece em nossa vida é para um aprendizado e propósito.
Forget it man!! Don’t torture yourself . My daughter was an extra in one movie where you acted (that one where u are a cop with the other funny fellow) and she told me that you are a very humble person reaching out to those In the set in case someone was needing something. I am looking forward to see you in a great movie again and  common we all are human beings my friend!!!
YOU WILL NEVER BE LIKE WILL SMITH THE PITCHER ON THE BRAVES!!! YOU FAKE WILL SMITH!!!!!!!!!!!
I think you're forgetting the most important question.  What took you so long?    That was 4 months ago!
Better late than never. Makes the world feel a little better somehow.
“disappointing people is my central trauma”.  I wonder how that happens
"I was fogged out." I'd buy that from an 8 year old, not an adult. Must be losing work. Well, too little, too late. Grow up.
As a father … as a man… I just want to applaud you.I hope you know that you are more than just your mistakes. You obviously have remorse. I pray that you move on because there is so much good you bring to the world and we need that now more than ever …. And don’t you forget it. Big hug
WILL SMITH
SMITH
Respect was already lost. This seems like a desperate attempt to repair your reputation.
Я думал это постанова была
Look, we all make mistakes 💁🏽‍♂️
We love you Will 💜
Move on already
Yawn. 😪
you are a great actor will, this is your best script yet.
Yea next time just pull Chris to the side and verbally express your frustration behind the scenes and if at that moment u believe you need to engage in a physical confrontation walk away never let emotions guide your decision you a 50 year old adult and an inspiration to myself and others much luv for ur apology I’m sure Chris will forgive u in due time but obviously not forget 💯
Hello is Russia 🇷🇺🤟✌️
Heyyyy Will, I MISS YOU!!  It's so good to see you sweetheart. Glad you are doing well. Now it's time for you to come back into our lives. You have sincerely given a genuine apology. You have nothing to be ashamed of. It's over, now hold your head up high, flash that MILLION DOLLAR SMILE and continue to be the PHENOMENAL Mr. Hollywood Prince we all fell in love with...FRIEND!! Will you are and forever will be "The Greatest Of All Time"!!💯💯🐐 P.S  Call Martin, he's waiting on you. "Bad Boy's 4, The Final Takedown"!! Love You!!♥️
Still watching anything you put out…
I don't know if this was supposed to come off as genuine, by being unorganized, but it just comes off as a bad script reading.
I just keep remembering the red table talk with your former co star from Fresh Prince. You traumatized her. I really hope you get some help and keep learning. Everyone makes mistakes, keep working on your self. We are all a work in progress.
🛌🏽
Everyone messes up. Every day. Sounds like you are taking every opportunity to be accountable for your actions and face the consequences. And it isn’t easy. It’s not easy to do but you are doing it so just keep going. You fell but you are getting back up and trying that’s all Any of us can do.
Bruh...  Abraham was a liar, Noah a drunk, Moses had anger issues, David and Solomon were womanizers, and Elijah was suicidal...  We are human beings fighting our own inner battles. Just evolve, and always remain humble, growth is a lifetime project.
Desperate move to save his career  Classic Hollywood
I want to apologise so I can continue living my privileged celebrity life.
Always have loved you as an actor, and will continue to do so. We all fall short of the Glory of GOD. We must give mercy to get mercy. Prayers lifted for you and your family Will. ✝️🙏💕
Will please stop focusing on the negative comments from all external sources. Keep working to rewire how you define your self worth. Thank you for your entire career thus far. 🙏🏽
He did the right thing and owned up to it  #Respect
Why you wearing branded hat?
I think you didn't nothing wrong. I'm sorry for all consecuences.
Some wounds never heal
Will you were asked to leave the Academy after the incident. You refused to leave. That was your biggest mistake there. The Academy had to remove you with force. You did not deserve to stay there when the Academy asked to leave.
Love you Will. God bless.
3:10, still covering for her. Solid man but damn, let her go.
Lol
Proud of your commitment to make changes and to hone up to your mistakes. It’s hard to sit there and you did. You might have a ways to go but you’ve started that journey. Love you and yours.
We love you, Will. We still love you...plain and simple. I bought your book on Audible and have listened to it several times. I KEEP listening to it and I understand your pain. I see it in your face, upon your countenance. I hear your heart and I pray that you forgive yourself soon because THAT burden is so hard to keep bearing.  You HAVE to let yourself off the hook; brother YOU HAVE TO.  Don’t give up on yourself Willard because we love you...you should try loving you, too. Everything that you are AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE NOT NEEDS TO BE LOVE AND LOVED ON...AND FORGIVEN. No one is perfect, brother,  if we were, WE WOULD NOT NEED GOD and THAT’S word to your “Gigi”! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😇😇😇😘🙏🏾
He is a pos for not even mentioning the the Williams family at all…
Well done
Vous êtes une super personnes will je vous soutiens énormément j'espère que tout ca va se rétablir bonne journée ou soirée a vous
Just go away.
# can't stay mad at Will. His humanity resonates ....at least to people like me that make mistakes ♥️
"I apologize to you."   Say you're sorry, Mr. Smith. I'm sure I'll get hate for this but sorry and apologize are not the same.
Sitill I really love and respect you the same❤️ you are really a role model in my life 👍
So many judgemental people on social media lol knowing good and well none of us are perfect. His apology seems sincere so I’m good with him, but it’s up to Chris to forgive him - we’re all just on the outside looking in.
You shouldn't try to live to other peoples standards, just be yourself
Chris is the one who has to apologize. Will, you did nothing wrong.
me personally i wouldn’t take my wife’s disrespect like that
Falsísimo
I think that we humans are flawed, not one of us is perfect and yes celebrities are humans and we all make stupid mistakes and do stupid things at times but those things do not define who you can be or have become.  What’s important is that we see our mistakes, own up to them, apologize and then move on, it isn’t up to me to say his apology is genuine or not.
It took you this long to apologize 😂 I don't believe it. Don't really matter. Only persons opinion who matters is chris
I’m still your friend Will
We love you Will ❤️
Well I personally don't so any need for Will to apologize. On behalf of an unambiguous black woman, thank you. The disrespect geared towards us is insane and this type of front stage demeaning behavior is something other women don't deal with from the men in their community. Idc who disagrees I said what I said. Thanks Will 🤷🏾
The mistake is over here you are with your best version of yourself, continue to work with creative your craft as legend forever! Nobody is perfect! That’s awesome you’re welcome back!
Already forgiven.
I don't know if I'm being naive, but he seems genuinely remorseful and sincere. He didn't make excuses, blame anyone or anything and didn't throw around the mental health card. He put his hands up and said 'I messed up, I'm human'.   This isn't going to magically wash away what he did, but it's a start.
I'll say it like this, if yall can forgive Logan Paul for what he did long ago, you all can forgive Will and watch him rise back up from this situation.
That's salesmanship at its finest. This did not feel like a real apology to Chris. I don't know how he will feel about. I guess we just wait and see what Chris has to say about this.
I read your book and understand your position at that time. I'm glad you are mature enough to stand in the fire to see the light. 🙏
Will again I believe U are growing and what is the opposite stagnation. I forgive U and as a fan, a relative to many, a human I forgive U beautiful, talented black man.😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤜🤛
Nah this fake sob story is because he got canceled. He’d do it again if he didn’t get backlash. Everyone in the comments is falling for it. He’s a self absorbed celebrity that only cares about Will. This was to save face not to really apologize
good msg .
Geoffrey: Tragic, TRAGIC!
We'll put together PR. 3 questions and make sure we get one that addresses the wife's role.
I don’t know but if he understand and has apologised one must be forgived
Respect is more than just a friendly face or a kind gesture. Respect is having enough humility to admit and understand when mistakes are made towards others.
Will,welcome back!We love u🙌🏻
is he promoting his company westbrook in his apology video?
3 months?! This shoulda happened at the latest the next day.
Way to go will. I don't condone what he did but I think he deserves forgiveness. It's going to take some time to heal from something like this.  I pray for all involved. We are all human beings. None of us are immune to doing something stupid.
Will...u for me: RIP
Kf you were on drugs, maybe, but it shows how little your words of love and love you brother mean to you. Even if Chris accepts your apology it will not remove the naked manifestation of your inner mindset.
Whoop 🤭
Respect for stepping up and acknowledging wrongdoing.
love you will. this is big of you
I'm sure Chris will reach out to you Will. He just needs some time to heal but he'll come around eventually . I believe millions were shocked and hurt that night but we all have done stupid things in our past. The trick is learning from them and not repeating the same mistake over and over and expect different results . I feel your sincerity and commend your efforts to set things right again . This fan of yours accepts your apology and I wish you and yours all the best going forward .
This new episode of Fresh Prince sucks 👎
There still wasn't a proper apology for Chris.
i think never going to be the same for Will ...  i dont think the people are expecting to see a movie  with him now, i dont ...
🤦
Apologizing takes both humility and strength. It’s not my place to forgive, for that belongs to Chris. I am glad to see Will apologize and own the mistake and not try to justify it. If Will’s goal is to become a better person despite this huge setback, who are we to get in his way? 🙏🏽
Glad you realized what you did is wrong.  I was never going to watch your movie again. But this statement changed that. Good luck and thanks for doing the right thing.
I'm just a fan out of the millions you've got, I'm a nurse aide from Sweden.. I looked up to you like a hero man. But then this happend and my whole respect for you just wen't down the drain. I was thinking like... like has he drunk several days in a row and lost his mind/temper, is he dillerious? .. I couldn't make sense of it. And I felt hurt.  Now that I see that you hurt too, and that you make this sincere video, my respect for you is... well it is well on its way to be repaired. Because as a fan - I EAGER to feel what I felt about you before this. I wanna be able to watch your AWESOME performances without thinking that you think that you are like... the person you became for that brief moment where you lost control. I understand you are just a human, with the same weaknesses and ability to f*ck up as everyone else, but you are also so much more to me. I want you to take care of yourself and continue to inspire people and like.. be the greatest? That you have been! And will be again!  You'll probably not even read this, and people might look at my comment and be like: lol, what a nerd. But YOU have made a BIG difference in my life through inspiration and your work, and I want to keep being inspired of you and having you as a rolemodel again.  Kind and hopeful regards and wishes of future success! <3
We're human, after all, and everybody's got something a little off somewhere.  Haruki Murakami
coming out here making a public apology without given Chris the time he asked for is trying to make him look bad if he doesn't forgive you... give the man a break...
Man u made a mistake, who doesn't, just keep doing u, u are a great inspiration will...mistakes are made, and we move forward n try to fix if we can, things.. 👍
There is history between the two of them that we know nothing of...
Kinda late there guy
So many people love the person that mike Tyson is today. He was able to bounce back from far more outrageous things that this. You’ve got this Will. By not ducking out you’re showing all of those that looked up to you that they weren’t wrong and that you can climb out of the pits you’ve dug for yourself
This is a horrible set.  Looks like a pizza box with a tissue on the table.  Also what’s up with the globe positioned behind Wills head?    Is that a lamp wearing a baseball jersey?
No one forgives you. You're a great actor but you're not fooling us this time.
If he want forgiveness he need to separate from the devil.
You are an adult and a Father,it was shocking,no excuses.
It’s a step in the right direction but there are still more questions and answer to be given
You're done dude, might as well as open up that used car dealership.
No one forgives you. You're a great actor but you're not fooling us this time.
😢
I still love you Will. I will still support you. We all fall short. Just stand back up!!
Will Smith youtuber type apology, insane
PS :  2:55 This high pitched voice, geez, she reall cutted your balls off, for you to not be able to maintain a masculine tone 😄
love you will
Anyone else find it disingenuous af how he’s got his “Just Water” product placement in this ‘apology’ video
I'm probably gonna get alot of hate for this but I think you saying I'm not gonna feel ashamed has proven that you are not handling what ever is going on with you the right way man. Obviously you can't change what happened but damn dude you did this in front of a live camera this moment will live on forever and you don't feel shame about it I can't understand that. As someone who truly knows what needing a mentor is like not wanting or looking up to but needing a mentor and you acted like that and don't feel shame is honestly unforgivable to me as a fan. I hope you and Chris can get past this and I hope you get better and grow from this
In my heart I believe your apology is genuine and very heart felt in my perspective! The industry can be very brutal and I’ve never been in it to the extent of you yourself.but I look and see others and that is put out there  what their actions are. No one know the true feeling and stress one’s going through! Especially dealing with the industry and how it has changed over the years. I stopped watching award shows a long time ago! Sidney Poitier is my favorite actor of all time and the last time I heard that man speak and one of the very few interviews he had done was with Larry king! @WILL SMITH if you can try and find that video! There is a hidden message I think you should see!
You are not a piece of sh*t if you realize your mistakes and are working to correct them. We are all human, so everyone of us has something in the past that brings us shame. Everyone has said or done something that is not representative of who they truly are. Owning the mistake and learning from it is the key. I’m glad you are working through things and I hope you can get past this.
Will, you are doing what you need to do, are you? Seein this video gave me a goood feeling for you. Hope Chris accept, in my opinion, you deserve it and without a doubt, you are sincere.
WILL SMITH DID NOTHING WRONG
Respect. he’s no different than anyone else. he makes mistakes just like you and I his are just more public. His apology seem sincere. It’s not about the mistakes you make but how you correct them!
Me encanta volver a verte querido Will...feliz de verte 🇨🇱
Nice Wario hat 👍
It's about time you took the red pill my friend #freewill
Still a fan.
👎
The fresh prince meant so much to us all growing up, giving us entertainment & laugher in our highs & lows... Hope you & Chris can sit down and leave this dark chapter behind
Good first step
you were not sorry that night, u sang and danced, no matter how many times you say sorry now after the whole world reacted, your apology will not be accepted. i became a big fan of yours after watching "the pursuit of happyness", but i will never watch your movie again in my life, all you want now is your career back, if you are really sorry, go to chris, hug him and say sorry
god bless you will  you will come back stronger than ever
A bit late buddy 👎🏼 specifically for a world class actor like you are. Needless to say that the whole community of comedy Is disgusted by your actions but even worse by the lack of respect and appreciation you have shown and yet again u sit there and pretend to apologize in a way that does not feel genuine.
This seems like the fakest apology of all time.
Can't fix the world if you can't fix yourself. It's a good place to start in taking some time and working on yourself like you are.
Yes it's stupid to take comedian seriously but hopefully we are all ready to do stupid stuff for love.
2022 Has been crazy not gonna lie
no disrespect but all your issues is because of a woman who doesn’t even love you such a disaster. you would be way better without her in your life get a better woman dude where is the guy that played fresh prince.
Wonder how much this upload is going to make him? Using his own platform to "apologize". Awesome business man!
Have missed you!!!!! Focus on yourself. You don’t owe any of us anything.
Will, you’ve taken steps to aid in the healing process for all impacted by your behavior. Humility is essential to mending broken relationships. I suggest extending and receiving forgiveness has an infinitely more profound impact that an apology. I believe this is what you intended. May I suggest you actually use the word forgive and apply it to yourself as well. I believe God will honor your choice from the heart and engage in the healing process.
I wish the dislike counter was back :(
Stop apologizing, you are what you are and that's how millions of people love you. I would be surprised if YOU had acted differently, if YOU had acted differently as a HUSBAND, if YOU had acted differently as a FATHER. You're cool... I didn't give him enough. Once again, stop apologizing, this unnatural tolerance is destroying America.
#TeamWill for life ‼️‼️
It’s just so hard to tell how genuine knowing you’re a professional actor. Genuinely it feels like a heckler got caught and named, that now he’s been publicized for his actions and doesn’t regret necessarily but wishes he just heckled the comedian softer. Love will smith but the history actors have just show what they say in-front of a personal camera is no different than a studios.
Can we please... as HUMAN lift up this man. Recognize that he is not perfect none of us are.  I believe in forgiveness, and I can only hope that the time for reconsiliation is faced between his two men. 🙏🏾
Gotta love the classic apology vid sigh at the start.
Bro the trauma you gave Chris infornt of whole national television was just too much  yk he might take years to be ready for a talk.
If there is a lesson to be learned from this whole incident, its that you should never put your idols and celebrities on pedestals. They are all human, and are just as capable of having bad moments and making stupid decisions as the rest of us. I think Will is a friggin moron for what he did, and it showed he lacked serious composure in controlling his emotions. I’m not gonna forget Will did what he did, but if he truly worked on becoming a better man then I will be happy.
Будь мужиком, он это заслужил.
And the Emmy for best YouTube apology goes to.....
Honestly, one of my favorite actors.  I think that was a scum bag thing to do.  That was really beneath you.
Please! Let me keep being famous. :'(
Alright everyone, now that this is done. Go down to the description and buy you a will smith poster though the provided link 😂 the man that won an Emmy for acting definitely isn’t acting here, it’s totally genuine! Now get down there and buy buy buy, because we all know that an apology video should also be an opportunity to push your merchandise.
YouTuber apology 😂
Well said. We all make many mistakes. I appreciated what you said with being remorseful but not ashamed. The decision was Unfavorable but you can mess up and still be a great person.  Thanks for doing the hard honest work the last 3 months. This is just a bump in the journey.
We all know dang well who’s to blame for all of this but I won’t be naming any names!!!
we all human we all make mistake i proud of you will smith trying to apologize and do better sometimes we gotta get people second chances in life
He even did the stereotypical walk in and sigh lol I love YouTube apologies they're always so bad.
I don’t forgive you sorry it took too long, you just realized it’s affecting your career so you had no choice
Remember people, he's an actor. Also why upload a Youtube video, just apologize directly.
Ok..... he's done enough apologizing, hopefully it's the last time. He's done his mea culpas...it's not the end of the world. Time to get back to normal fresh prince!
So wait.  Releasing now because you are afraid people forgot about you again?  We did…..  Go to them in person and apologize.  YouTube is nothing but narcissistic ways for your own benefit.  Sad.  Even worse.
people saying this is sincere... the dude literally just won an emmy for ACTING....
I missed you my hero 💜

Lol you should be ashamed of yourself
That was a very “strategically placed” picture on the wall. The camera consistently paned out to perfectly fit it in frame. This looks like a big act lol.
This is me after a bad drinking night.
We will always love you Will,we always have.
I can relate to how he’s feeling , definitely not on the same scale . But feeling remorse and shame sometimes seems to go hand in hand but it doesn’t . Self forgiveness is so so hard Will , and I have faith that you will get past this as I hope that in my life I can be redeemed from my lowest moments of hurting someone and exposing that wicked from within me . We are all a bunch of broken , sinfully tempted people but we are also capable of so much love and joy . Keep up your head and pray to God Will . God has the power and has already forgiving you , it is your turn to harness that for He’s the only one you’ll one day answer to which is so much greater than this moment . Don’t lose sight of everything’s purpose even when the rightful judgement of others comes down remember your purpose and that all will be fulfilled . I’m praying for you brother , stay peaceful and don’t be too hard on yourself . 🙏🏽
Fuerza Will, has hecho demasiado por tu público y no se va a echar a perder todo tu gran trabajo por un mal momento.
Oh yea, this guy is just so sorry and genuine that he had to bring an entire film crew over to film this. Give me a damn break. Smith is as fake as they come.
What? You’ve got to feel shame. Remorse follows shame. You might be able to move on from shame when Chris forgives you. This is really not any kind of improvement on your original apology. Saying “I apologize” is admitting a wrong doing whether you are sorry or not. It means nothing and I absolute cannot stand it. The body language here is not matching the words and this video is weird.
Good for you. I was beginning to think you didn’t care. Glad to hear this.
Actions speak louder than words.
Ok, can we talk about the political and the economic state of the world?
Fake apologies, just trying to sell his water
Make it up by doing more charitable contributions and volunteer work for mental health and emotion/anger management. I'm not saying to donate more money and call it a day, I'm saying to put in your personal time to create/maintain programs, volunteer, educate, speak on your experiences and reflections to help people, to help communities deal with emotions. Be like Mister Rogers.
I’m not here to bash you or judge you Will only god can judge you but I’ll say this continue your journey to be better and may things get better and all is forgiven for you and Chris so y’all can spread black unity! God bless brother!!
rofl. took him this long for something so basic? sounds like he needs an audit or two by Tom Cruise.
It’s impossible for me to be mad at your mistakes when I know I have made worse. We all deserve another chance, our mistakes do not define us.
Man you need to take some time off stop being so serious! Dude had a camera crew just to say he sorry. You gonna bust man take a deep breath, And say it with me "Im just a man"
nah
Will Rules! 👏👏👏
an actor is always gonna act, because an actor never gets out of character. 🤔🙄
Delete your youtube i think that will show you really care i think people will understand knowing how much you love your youtube channel
Mad respect to Will. He can't go back and undo it, but he can learn from his mistake and move on. If I can change, and if you can change, then everybody can change. 🙏
Will I love you but you let us down. We’ll get over it but we know you’re better than that. We’re all human. Just continue to be great.

you did good. I wish you well
One moment of madness can cause a lifetime of reflection, but it can never be forgotten and the consequences last forever. Accept what has happened and live a happy life with the woman you so publicly  protected.
Everything is fine, we all love you and hope you're doing fine, relax! we are always learning and improving. All your fans and people who wish you well are here for you!!
Cmmon tate W
An actor doing a scripted piece comes off canned and inauthentic.  Go on someone's podcast that will ask you tough questions.  I can think of a few.
Grew up loving both you and Chris - still do - you did something really dumb - pay the price and move on
I have always been and will always be a big fan of yours. I appreciate this more than you know. We make mistakes we build we grow and we learn. Something that we all have to do. Forgive yourself and move on from this knowing you are a better person. I love you Will …
Please stop with inserting your professional credentials (e.g. Therapist) into the comments. No one knows by just looking here whether you are competent. As the great comedian George Carlin once said, "Somewhere in the world is the world's worst doctor. And the scary part is: somebody has an appointment with him tomorrow morning!"😄
It's not up to us to forgive you. It's up to Chris, and a real man would know that
Don’t forget y’all this man just won a best actor award👀😂
He read that question like he didn’t know what it was before hand lol
@WILL SMITH I wish I could meet you in person! Man I still think you are an awesome guy!!! No mater what people say! I never turned my back because we are all human and make mistakes! I’m 43 years old brother. Not too far from you but you have inspired me especially with your music! My favorite songs by you are PARENTS JUST DONT understand,SUMMER TIME,YOU SAW MY BLINKER B-TCH,GETTING GIGGY WITH IT, even the MEN IN BLACK sound track I believe you produced was excellent and went great with the theme of the movie! Something we don’t see. If not maybe it’s just me but I’m a movie fanatic! I ROBOT, oh oh man HANCOCk hands down is next to BAD BOYS in MY opinion 😃😂😂😂👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾you was the man in the movei and you kept it real❤️❤️ much love from NEWPORT News Virginia.
We all do things we are not proud of and I think we should all atleast earn the chance to be forgiven. Not be forgiven but the chance to work at being forgiven .
Les moments de faiblesse arrivent...vous êtes humains. Merci pour votre sincérité et bon courage à vous et vos proches.
For all the white Knight in the comment, it's not your job to forgive him on Chris behalf.  .
Thank u uncle Oakland California love u ⭐️ couldn’t wait too c u thank u 💋🪐
Spoko, gówno-burza i tak już go skreślili ze świętego lasu. Kiedyś wystarczyło by żeby powiedział prawdę, że poczuł się urażony, że ktoś śmieje się z fryzury jego żony i dlatego jebnął mu plaskacza :) Dzisiaj trzeba robić otoczkę prawa i porządku do wszystkiego, inaczej cię nie zatrudnią i nie zarobisz...
It takes a real man to make this video and apologize and admit you made a mistake. You are human and you have given more light into this world than darkness. I hope Chris and his family can forgive you so you can forgive yourself too and everyone can heal. Much respect for making the video.
We can all look at him like a celebrity (he is) and we are definitely all entitled to not believing his apology is authentic, or is motivated by something else that deals with the Will Smith brand, but one thing I do believe: we, who all participate in the internet, should have a place open for people to apologize and own up to their decisions and behavior.  If we continue to not allow people to change or correct themselves like humans do in real life, then we will keep creating this reality where people constantly choose to double-down and reject reality.   This is my simple reason why I will give this video a thumbs up.
Honestly you just didn't disrespect  Chris but disrespected mostly of the world for me Mr Smith I wouldn't accept your apology 💯  I was a big fan of yours but now Honestly I hate just hearing your voice you cnt do such  who gives you the right to such   . People do such and then apologize , the heat you deserve it  and it's part what you did sorry wouldn't  save or help you
Much agape love Big bro🙏🏽🤍
It is beautiful for me you are doing this video now because I know you are being sincere, and it is not a task you had to do just because the people asked for it when the event passed.
Unsubscribed just now … damn bro I didn’t even play summertime this summer … smh
Will you had a human moment,  not a great moment but nevertheless a HUMAN MOMENT!...afford yourself some grace and get on with the business of living......much love my brother ❤️
you made an attempt to make ammends with  Chris, his family, your family, Fans the media, your fellow nominees ; Hopefully you talked to God about it and ask for forgiveness once you do that will You have done all you can, Let Healing take place naturally with Gods Help. Everybody is Human But Not Everyones STUFF is on Display and people forget that.   We all need some grace and Hopefully you get some as well.
I have one question one only question who is the DP ?why He’s leaving that ball lame behind your head, for me, I will never forgive that !!!
Ppl make mistakes
No forgiveness until you break free from Succubus and get your Bawls back
Thanks for coming back Will no ones is perfect we forgive you and love you and missed you!
NOT BUYING THIS
I’ve always thought alot of Will, nonetheless, he still has ALOT of mental work to do. Take some more time my brother.
Amen 🙏🏽
Missed you!
Its alright you made an public apology
I can see you really mean your apology. Hope things work out for you and Chris.
We all do misstakes. To be honest I was upset beginning, but i still love you. God bless you and I look forward to see more of you in the future 🙏
You need to get rid of that toxic woman.  Grow a pair.
Uncle Chris i  hope and pray that you  allow Will's request. It hurts to  see black man not talking to eachother. Uncle Will you need to stay away a little longer from all social media platforms and just enjoy yourself with yourself privately. I love uncle Will. Everytime he cries i cry. I love uncle Chris being Uncle Chris.
Wish YouTube hadn't stopped the dislike button.
He's only apologizing now because of the backlash
why was acting viewed with contempt in ancient times?? it's because it's impossible to tell if they are being genuine in their normal life dealings. he ran away on vacation to the UAE to escape criticism us normies can't do that.
on the road to forgiveness, this is a solid first step🙏
😍 🙏🏾
You made a mistake Will, and hurt a genuinely good man and his family in the process. Learn from it, overcome it, provide love and support to him and his... a lot of us look up to you and a mistake you can move forward from by simply being you, the you we all know you to be, is not going to change our admiration and respect for you. Good energy to all involved, grow.
I still love you man ❤️
Another youtube apology to add to the list :V
It has been a minute we Miss you im proud of you for apologizing
Это не извинения а объяснения.
You are a human. Humans make mistakes. Keep on keeping on!
This guy made one big mistake in an otherwise exceptional career where he has always been known as the good guy. He waited til he was ready to talk again and he did everything he could to make things right. I hope Chris can forgive him and we can move on from this.
When the apology is AS loud as the act was. I applaud Will. It’s takes a man to be a man. All is well ❤️
Chris is gonna forgive one day but no one is gonna forget this.  When you think so your more a man then others that your actions are justified.  I remember after it happened he didn’t apologize to Chris.  This is his real character.  He’s doing this so he can make money again.
I didn't expect to have tears watching this. I can feel a deep sorrow and remorse. It takes a strong person to admit when they make a mistake. Time heals all things.
Stunning and brave
Glad to see your face again, Will.  We’ve been worried about how you’re doing.  We miss you!
Rubbish! Too little too f*cking late!
Dude. Just stop. Go live your life. Bye.
I think the most important thing about all this event is, Please Will learn how to love yourself over anything and whoever. We love you ❤.
I'm still a fan of your work, but I'm no longer a fan of your character.
Not good enough sir.. not one bit. #stillINtheDOGHOUSE #phillyDUDEsaySO
Love is the cure on the wall. Great production guys
Люди совершают ошибки, не все их признают...Я знаю многих людей, для которых ты по-прежнему остаёшься главным кумиром. Даже в этой сложной ситуации, да. Спасибо за большое открытое сердце, Will, лично я почувствовал что ты сказал. Ты был и остаёшься моим кумиром уже более 15 лет, и снова подаёшь пример как стоит выходить из столь сложных ситуаций. Спасибо, Уилл ✊
I hope you'll take the opportunity to play a villain in a movie for a change. Seems like you avoided such roles because of your public image, or maybe you're just typecast as the good guy. Maybe audiences would never be able to see you in such a light. But it'd be interesting to see what you could bring to the table in that regard. This decade is the decade of nuanced villains, and I think there's a role that could be reflective of your situation, that would hopefully teach audiences a bit of empathy.
Will,  we still have a love for you.  Everyone makes mistakes.  This too shall pass,  You have learned a great lesson.
We're Still friends Mr. Smith!
❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE YOU WILL!!!😍❤❤❤

Chris Rock's next special about to be hugeeeee. Watch
Question: Why didn't you apologize to Chris during your acceptance speech? Answer: I was foggy Nah bro. Right after that you were dancing with celebs holding your award
Feels stiff and forced. Hopefully if you talk to Chris, man to man, you're more sincere. Real change is needed on the inside and in your future actions.
Forgiveness is everything and time heals all wounds. I forgive you dude, because it  affected me as a fan too.... still love you
Damn will we all are tested .. god is working through you trust and believe .. this was real standup of you and sincere .
Marty the Zebra still ain't sitting at the Red Table, FOH
Man I love Will. My view on him changed a lot since the incident, but I know that wasn’t the real him. He’s had too many bad influencies over the years and isn’t surrounded by the right people, starting by the person that should guide him.
Such a loser. I swear to god, we need nuclear winter so badly.
The only thing you can do is what you're doing. You have to give people the time and space. To me, you're not a PoS. This goes a long way to proving it. Sometimes when we get big headed, we knock ourselves back and I believe that may be what happened to you.  I wish you grace and hope you are able to repair relationships.
Will is still the Best...One Love...
He was wrong yes. But when you love the mother of your kids. You can’t and won’t let people embarrass them particularly on national tv.
The moment happened. It can’t unhappen. With that, he’s doing the right thing(s). Apologize to the public. Seek forgiveness from Chris and his family. Then make whatever restitution possible.
I Respect That! Good Luck Getting Back OG!
What you have given us can never be tarnished by what you did. It's uncomfortable watching this video. I pray we all get over esp. you. Cause you are our hero.
Oh Will. I am sending so much love to you.
He said he's trying to avoid feeling ashamed of himself. I think shame is a perfectly acceptable response to what he did. But, he should not *hold on* to that shame for long. Then it becomes unhealthy. Feel all the feelings and then get it over with.
Love you Will
Who's Will Smith?
Feel sorry for the dude. Things like this shows how psychologically destroyed celebrities are. Situations like this can’t be dealt with in a way most normal people can. Celebrities are given a mantle they have to live up to that’s unrealistic and when they make mistakes, the consequences are ten fold
What is so hard about saying "I'm sorry." "I apologize" is so disingenuous and self-serving. "I'm sorry" takes ownership. 👎
I think Will Smith should keep Chris Rock’s name out of his mouth until Chris reaches out to him.
I forgive you Will, you are only human. We all make mistakes in life, it's just the magnitude of which yours happened. I pray for you Chris to get past this because we need strong black men like you guys to be a beacon for us and our children. I pray for both of your families to heal and move on past this so that you all can get back to doing the wonderful things that you all do for humanity. Peace and love to you all, love you...💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏
Never fall from grace. Fall with grace.
❤️ I love you!!!!!! Você é maravilhoso, tanta coisa boa que já fez, isso vai passar, e queremos o Will de volta, com todo brilho que sempre teve!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
3 months to give a 6 min apology video (that felt more like a Q/A), when you could have done it that night, or at the very least the next day. How long were you fogged out. I think the fact the whole room gave you a standing ovation gave you a false sense of righteousness.
I love you will, as a person I look up to I forgive you and I hope you get through this and conquer it
Nothing is Irreparable but death you’ve always been my idle and always will be I’m proud of you. You’re human this will pass.
Well done man... well done. #OWNit = #RESPECT
I just Miss Will as Fresh Prince 👑 he’s not the Prince we known I miss the funny man
It’s a step in the right direction.  You owning this makes me feel a lot better about you.
nothing wrong with slappin' a nigga if you think he violated. if anything, invite chris for a fade if he has a problem with it
It's time for a Will Smith album!
I cannot imagine how difficult this whole situation is for both of them. I gotta say props to him for making this video, seems like there's some real trauma there and I hope he continues to get the help he needs. I hope for healing for both of them.
Hard to respect a person that doesn’t respect himself and stays in an abusive relationship.  Grow some balls dude.
I have one thing to say, after watching this video. Chris, don't believe a word he says.
Done. That's all you had to do, man up. Now you can begin to move on. We all make mistakes. You are not the first, you won't be the last.
Luckily Chris is still alive today! What about if he was gone then. Take sometime is good but this is bullshit . More like you want to get back to where you used to be and asking for your fan support not Christ . Go to him or call him . Is that something impossible for you to do?
Cringe. Blink twice if jaida is holding you hostage.
Why would he want to talk to you? You humiliated him on National Television and seen by everyone around the world. How would you feel if he would of done that to you? You would of never wanted to speak to him again.  Are you starting to realize you need to this because you are truly sorry or because your career is tanking because of it? Thats the real question. Who are you doing this for.
This is ripe for some Red Table Talk with you two
It’s hard but sometimes our worst shows up when we’re trying to do our best. This is why what we see and experience in our youth can matter in our adult life. So be mindful of what children see and hear it always has an impact on them.
0:51 "So I will say to you (um) Chris. I apologize to you". How about "Chris, I am sorry". Leave his mom out it. Leave his family out of it. Nuances? Just say sorry. And keep your head high; your family should love you unconditonally.
It really ain't that deep
How was India?
Bravo, Will! this is honest, and heartfelt.
He's really good at his job. The vid. shows that! Cool act man!
he didn't cry, it doesn't work 😅
Let’s see you do a roast.
Good for Will to apologize. And shame on EVERYONE who believed his behavior was ever okay.  Imagine if this were ANY white actor (Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jim Carey, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Seth Rohan…) instead of Will Smith.  It would not only end their career but the woke mob would insist it was a racist attack and they would never let them live in peace again.
A lot of celebrities have said he's a nice guy and he needs to get a divorce. What do they know 🤔 that we don't know?
We all do mistakes, and no one should look up to you or to anyone. You are a kind human being, you are no monster or evil person.
This is so very thoughtful of you, may Allah bless you and anything you lay your hands on
Man your only human sucks that people treat people with fame more than that. Yes people look up to you but at the same time you gotta be yourself. Also hey man I need the Bright Two to come out someday soon 👍
Please seek professional therapy, Will. That was what we all thought you needed when we witnessed what happened. You are no doubt a person with great intentions but something was obviously stirring deep inside of you to create this outcome.
He needs tot all to him face to face like a guy
He didn't apologize because he didn't realize how much trouble he was in. Now that he knows, he put this BS together. It is over for Will. This is your legacy. You are done.
We still love you! Your human! Can’t wait to see what you have coming up next.
It gets worse before it gets better. I hope to see some aggressive life changes in will smiths future. Only then will things get better.
No explanation... To me it doesn't land with the subtle promoting of hid Will hat and water beside him... I see a prepared speech.. I don't feel sincerity
Noone is perfect!
Will, everyone has done something (or more likely more than one thing) that they regret. We all try our best, but sometimes our emotions get the best of us and we lose the ability to control our behavior. I'm also incredibly hard on myself and feel shame for a myriad of things. I'm also working on how to take responsibility for my life, without being consumed by my inner critic. It's damn hard! It's wonderful that you apologized and I hope that Chris and yourself eventually talk it out, so that Chris can get to express his feelings and you can get closure. All we can do in life is learn from our mistakes and try to be better in the future. All the best!
Bro life is just fucked. Lost my dad last month in an accident and I know I just have to keep moving forward
"It is human to err". Let's forgive and move on. The world is already hard and unforgiven as it is.
Love you
Thanks for your transparency, Will. That takes real courage...and I see you. You are a human and not infallible, like the rest of us. Praying for you, brother. 🌹
Too little too late, no thank you take this BS home
We still love you Will.  Chris will come around!
He seems to have a well-developed sense of attrition. "Trying not to think of myself as a piece of sh*t." You have to assess that, but if you always dismiss your mistakes as: "well I guess I'm just a piece of sh*t," then you'll never grow into anything bigger than a piece of sh*t.
Rochelle forced him to do it.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice acting
Huruma muoneeni mzee wenu.
Really enjoyed mostwill smith films but after this I made the decision never to watch another will smith film ever again. Inexcusable. Sorry but can’t ever be undone.
🙏🏾 peace and healing energy for both Men.
It’s not good enough....Get a divorce... get some counselling ....
This is what real men do. Apologise and recognise their mistakes. Thank you Will for every young man who watches this
I'll admit I glad u own up to responsibility to it but at this point if u expect ur career to come back in some light it's not u dimmed the room to see ur ego displayed on table which was never considered in public eye, tbh this is no different with a break up with a ex and finding out they are a horrible person not totally but what's was displayed is vulgar and lack of respect will smith I wish u the best but considered a career change at this point limelight not there
Just want to say your wife’s the problem dude, obviously whittled you down into what you are today. Shits real sad
I appreciate that message. Still look up to you in areas, probably more so. First rule of leadership, everything is your fault. Way to own it. I can see your pain.
Why the hell do we - normal people - care about this pointless drama anyway?
Thanks for having the courage to get back on the court. This is what it looks like to face your fears and to take responsibility. Reminds me of the IF poem; it would appear that your embodying that. At the end of the day who are we to judge or to make another man our idol. Keep going. You inspire me even in your darkest moments.
Despite what happened I still wish you and Chris the best. Hopefully he gets to a comfortable enough space  where he's willing to have that conversation with you. There's just too much going on in the world right now for two of our most influential black entertainers to not get along.
At least he was man enuff to know he was wrong. We all gotta move on from this. Bel-air season 2 is what we should be focusing on….💜
You human
Why are you still with a woman who disrespects you in every turn?
4K , that’s how it’s done 👌🏻
Absolutely fair enough. Reasonable and rational. To make it fair, Chris should tag you back, in public. Doing that would be the best way to deal with this from here.
The Will Smith I know realized he could hurt people not just physically but verbally and decided to use his words for love in this world and thats the guy I respect.  Ps. Its time to see Will Smith get back to the fresh prince of bel air shape and energy, no time to spare.
♥️
Videos like this are why I miss the the ability to see the amount of dislikes
This is how you adult and take ownership for your actions. Proud of you Will! 🥰❤
It was a great meme tho
Scripted.
This is material for South Park.
I was really disappointed, because I've always shaped my life and behaviour around you... I'm so glad you finally spoke out... I'm here for the future endeavours
Will, your human. Crap happens in life. You did what you thought was right at that moment, we have all done it. You have had time to process what happened and have done what was needed. It’s done, let’s move on. I have grown up watching you and you will be back better and stronger. It’s another  lesson in life completed. All done stupid things but it doesn’t mean we have to live in the past
He made a bad mistake ! THEY SAY, THINK AND DO, NOT DO AND THEN THINK !
We can all learn from how you have handled your mistake. Own it and apologize from the heart. That's all that anyone can ask of you. There are many who screw up and never apologize.
I'm glad he recognizes the harm he caused and glad he apologized to Questlove.
I use to dance to will Smith songs 🎵 as a kid. I looked up to will. Fresh prince, wild wild west and of course men in black are my favorite will Smith movies. I felt let down that this happened but it's life. JUST DONT DO IT AGAIN WILL ✌✌✌
One moment doesn’t nor should it ever define a legacy.  We were made in the image of the creator.  But no one is I dare say perfect.  Trauma is a substantial catalyst to many ill made decisions.  Owning up to and taking responsibility to call out our own flaws is what make us human.  Your talent and inspiration is never not needed in this world.  Take your time.  We will be right here waiting.  - your friend.
Let’s forgive him and support him
Bro sounded like he was reading a script
Still no excuse for After Earth. Sorry Will,  there's not a PR team on earth can make that turd float.
I accept your apology. We are all wrong and there is no perfect. I hope it works out well with Chris and his family. Greeting from Argentina
Good job Mr.Smith
I think people forget that celebs are humans too. We build them up only to knock them down when they disappoint.  We wouldn't want our darkest moments played out on national television, and all have done things we aren't proud of.  I feel for you, WIll.   Happy to see you embracing this healing journey.
Building your credibility one step at a time. I'm rooting for you.
Go enjoy ya millions.....oh wait. Not convince at all.
Everybody makes mistakes, man. We stil love u and we'll always be friends:) u just have to forgive yourself too🫂
Will: "I apologize to you (knife hand out)" Chris: *flinches*
Fam Im so proud of you  your still my man God bless you 🙏🏾  fam
This was too short. It could've been at least 20mins. I know there were a lot more questions he could've answered. Still love Will tho
This breaks my heart, for all parties involved.  I'm sad, and I pray for everyone's healing.
Love you Brotha Will ❤️❤️
You are forgiven over here! ✝️ I pray Chris is able to as well. 🙏🏽 I hope WE as A PEOPLE will heal. 💞
Does anybody else feel like this would be squashed if he just let Chris smack the hell outta him in Times Square live? IJS 🧐
We all lose sight sometimes its allowed  Chris will find forgivness in time hes a good dude  Dont forget to forgive yourself will  Love ya brotha  👋✌️❤️🤙
Now, this is how a grown man deals with his problems. I'm glad to hear you speaking with a clear face and humble posture about an honest mistake. You don't owe anything to your fans anymore, this is between you and Chris, I hope to see, someday, both of you sharing laughs.
I forgive you Will .
We love you... I hope you are Ok.
B I G   W I L L
Stop living for your fans and live for you! You don’t need to live up to the expectations of strangers. Grow, love, learn, and be happy!
This is the best thing one can do and leave the rest for God to minister unto others in his timing. Repentance and Forgiveness are 2 specific mandates by God for man to grow and live by that translates into reconcilation with God and Man,  and also Man to Man, respectively. Healing, Peace and Freedom are activated when we act on taking these steps through Grace.  We all can use a fresh start by being accountable and humbling ourselves, reproof and correcting ourselves to be elevated as a better human being, and to one another. It would be unrealistic to believe that this can be achieved by one shot as all of God's Heroes & Heroines had a fair share of trials, then victory followed. Will and Chris, Peace and Love be unto your brotherhood. You both are great men, and shall smile and share the same space again at a divine appointed time. Be encouraged. One Love. The Bahamas is rocking with you both.🇧🇸❤
There’s no need to be held in a prison of past mistakes. It seems to me that you are doing the work. The way I see it, we all got work to do.
You see...what had happened was...
Yesssssssssss he's back we still love you man speak your heart out 🐏💫💯💪❤
Hope it all works out in the end...Everyone makes mistakes and the courage to come back and face those mistakes is the important thing because sometimes we don't think of what is wrong or right.
You reap what you sow.
Leave her and move on. She’s is crazy.
Urgh if you think this ain’t about saving his money and career and that he just truly cares what us peasant strangers think of him… you’re delusional and you’re the reason Hollywood continues to gain power over important issues to us that don’t even apply To them yet they have influence towards these issues. Please stop worshiping freaking celebs. It’s so weird and actually dangerous
"Will Smith is a fine young man." - Carlton -
You can tell that this incident has deeply affected Will Smith. And he’s trying to work through this. Hopefully he will get through this and will be able to make amends with Criss
You can be a positive and good person for decades but one mistake and you‘re done. What a world man…
Actually it’s been more than a minute
So true, Will. You can be remorseful without being ashamed. You are an amazing person and this one incident does not define you or your career.
Social media fucked up our attention spans. That’s why it feels so long ago. Everybody moved on. Same thing with astroworld. And celebs know this and use it to there advantage. Blessings to everyone though
Some people can’t even apologize for saying something hurtful let alone physically hurting someone. Will continues to teach us that vulnerability is strength. Stop criticizing.Take notes.
i speak for everybody when i say this, we do not care.
We're ALL HUMAN. We all mistakes. Never live up to people's expectations because you will always disappoint them. Always just be the best person you can be. And that's all we can do. I'm happy Will is continuing to make his stance about the situation and reminding everyone he is sorry. There will be people who won't buy it, but what matters is moving forward and learning to forgive. It doesn't have to come overnight and it may never come, but trying is what matters.
And still he is promoting his sons ‘water’ in the background. in an apology video🫣
Embarassing
Damn look at what crawled out of the sewer smh. What a tool this man is
I was so angry with you in the beginning. But "we fall down but we get up". Nobody is perfect we all make mistakes in life. You're admitting that you were wrong now its up to Chris to reach out to you. I've been a fan for years and I'm still an admirer of you. Life is too short and tomorrow ain't promised. You apologize and that's all that you can do. So now it's time to move forward.
I'm so happy you're back. We ALL have been there in some capacity or another. You live in a fish bowl, so you have to be more careful. Chris and everyone have already forgiven you, so do what you do best. Make us smile. The world still spins, Brother and its better with you in it.
Would be better if you weighed the consequences of your actions before doing them, so that you don't have to apologize later. Man up.
We still love you! We are all living this human experience together and evolving.
Is this a real thing? Who is he talking to in the beginning ?
Love you will❣️❣️💖❣️❣️
Just finished his book so this is great timing. It was a great read!! Highly recommend
Will is not a bad person y’all just want a reason to dislike successful people so y’all are dragging the situation through the mud . He made a mistake let’s forgive & move on it’s not our place to judge anyway.
This apology took way too long to happen.
This is what being a man is. And that’s why we love u. You’ve been a idol to black men like myself not just because of your success but your willingness to accept what is, and move forward.  I hope Chris makes that call. I know he hasn’t turned his back on you.
God Bless You
It was the wrong reaction for that time and place but you had a reaction to protect you family and it gets foggy when it is your family.
Let me get this straight...  Chris isn't ready to talk to you, probably not ready to accept or listen to an apology from you, so you release a video of you apologizing to him for the world to see?  Just goes to show you weren't apologizing to him because you're genuinely sorry but you just wanted the public approval for the gesture.
You really messed up bro.
This is glaringly insufficient. The inner rage and overwhelming self-regard are still so clearly in place. He SHOULD be ashamed of himself. I see no genuine remorse. I see regret about how this has ruined his life, but I see no remorse. In my opinion, Smith is justifiably done. He ruined his own career. It was his choice. If he had any genuine class, he would fade away now and just start doing good for others.
Respect!
Im still going to support will. He made a mistake and he’s owing up to it.
As humans we all make mistakes. Its what you do and how you own up to them afterwards that decides your path forward. Will, you are not a "piece of sh**t". You are handling this as a true stoic. I never had a doubt you wouldn't.
This is where I imagined your head might be these last few months… I don’t know you, or pretend to know where your head is right now, but I can feel hints in this.   I trust there is growth, ripping such a powerful bandaid off these last couple years with your book and everything else leaves raw untreated wound to deal with.   I’m looking forward to seeing who Will becomes tomorrow. I don’t think he’s done yet.   Yesterday is a memory,  on to tomorrow.
Damn, that's crazy. Who asked though?
Старина Уилл, мы в России искренне не понимаем, за что ты должен извиняться перед этим дерьмом. Ты сделал то, что должен был сделать каждый настоящий мужчина. Надо было пнуть его покрепче! Приезжай в гости, в страну, где ещё ценятся традиции и преобладает здравый смысл. В страну, где урод, который оскорбляет твою семью, получает по морде!
Someone needs to tell this man he doesn't have to get on camera and do this.
Kindness & mercy are real. And I as a fan, fellow human, & truth seeker felt that for you immediately. 💜 Kudos to you Mr. Smith for your humanness & well deserved award & your truth seeking. 💜
it takes a lot of courage to admit fault and apologize.  I command you for doing that Will!   I wish if it was much much sooner.  Actually that was the only disappointing part for me.  Because we all make mistakes....it's a part of the fabric of being human.   Following you for years, I knew this day was coming but in my mind, I had you doing this right away.   You have done a lot of great things over your life and this will not erase any of them in my book.  And I am sure it will make you an even better person in the future.  Time to move on!!
I am immensely sad for both parties. This apology was hard to watch tbh because you can see how much of a mental toll this has taken on him. I hope there is some reconciliation out of this.
You’re only apologising because your career has failed miserably since that horrible moment lol
No-one cares.  It's done  Own it Do better
A man is NOT measured by his physical stature, but rather his humble character.  Takes a big man to do this; and on this platform.   Doesn't make what happened right but sure does place Will in the right direction.  Love you Will!!
Eres un muy mal ejemplo para la gente joven. Dedícate a otra cosa: como a las labores del hogar ya que te comportas como una mujer del siglo pasado y no como un hombre de familia.
I say we forgive Will. He's human like us. Still funny to see Will as a Rubik's cube though: https://youtu.be/3gPiUnDpe5o
I support you and Ukraine
It was heartening and positive to hear you speak about what happened. It also took a lot of courage Will. I at this moment am very proud of you. It takes a true “man” to say “I’m sorry” and really mean it and do the work it takes to make things right. Forgive yourself too my brother!
Everybody in the comments is eating up his bs He’s losing work so now he’s trying to recover his career
Now let's get back to some will movies!
You need to apologize to everyone who was subjected to your rage- and I mean the world audience. I've worked with many actors and hence, know the sense of entitlement that many feel (and exhibit) as their professional success increases,  Personally, I was really upset by your behavior and frankly, remain bothered by it.  You need to get some therapeutic help for your clearly underlying rage, and then come back with your 'apologies.'
Will Smith is one of those few celebrities you feel like you grew up actually knowing them. That moment was confusing and disappointing but it was more than a fan/celebrity thing. I hope he understands what he means to the black community.
Theres a moment in everyones life where we wish we could it take back. It happens to the best of us. One mistake doesn't take down your legacy. Thank you for everything you've given to our generation.
Never stopped being a fan
We are only human Will, you gonna Be ight Because your Real fans gonna allways have your Back 🙏
Well done, Will. Now where is Chris Rock's apology?
I really hope he means it
It takes a big man to offer up an apology.  I,for one, stand up for Will.  All of us make mistakes and sometimes choose the wrong way to deal with things.  I'm pretty sure there isn't a person alive who hasn't made one (or more).
Hollywood needs to stick to being Hollywood. Back to making movies and humor, thats it.
Will, stop torturing yourself and move on. You can't keep apologizing forever.
Cringe
Mathew 6:15 But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Don’t keep un forgiveness in your heart. God is love and we need to remember the most important thing is love. God bless you all thank you Jesus for what you have done in my life he can change me he can change you
Will, I have no  clue if you read any of this.  I am a 61 year old man from Texas. I get it, understand you are a man who is an entertainer.  You are just trying to be a man with the added obstacles of being in the spotlight 24/7. You have apologized, you have explained what happened.  When Chris wants to talk, sincerely apologize again then forgive yourself,  even if Chris doesn't.  Never forget because you learned a life lesson, but forgive yourself.  Just my $0.02 , Blessings to you brother.
I think that......I DON'T CARE
He's not perfect...& In my opinion he's taking the right steps...don't get all the bashing 😒
Amber Heard should learn from this
People make mistakes. Anger is the biggest motivator when it comes to our actions, whether right or wrong. Sometimes, we don't think when our buttons are pushed. Will Smith knows he made a mistake and is being a man and dealing with the consequences. It starts with a sincere apology. Kudos for admitting you're wrongs.
But for the grace of God, and the lack of cameras in my face all the time, go I.
No 53 year old man behaves this way. Sorry not buying it. You also damage Janet Hubert entire career after she left Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
Connecting people through compassion.
Will lied at 3:05
Not your fan anymore.
Thank God you are backkkkkk!!!! 🙆🏾‍♀️🙆🏾‍♀️ So happy to see youu , pressed like before even watching. I support you in all your success , as well as mistakes and failures. We are only human. "Remorseful without being ashamed" That is very deep , and relatable.  You are my virtual father , so there's unconditional love. 💜
He said when he ready to talk, and here you go addressing it. So 6 degree's of separation of you will.
I doubt if being sorry or apologies will help you. My advise is keep on reaching to Chris so will atleast give you a peace in your life. Forget about Career or being Idol. You are no different to Bill Cosby now.
we all make mistakes and we're all human. That's as long as we correct our mistakes and take accountability for our actions.
@ Will Smith, I don’t really care what happened, it’s old news. I’m glad to see you’re here and still breathing 💯
It would make sense if you could also talk to your kids. They're not helping you.
"Chris is not ready" he doesnt need to be, he owes you nothing, the nerves of this guy to put the burden on chris.
Notice how they have a light behind his head trying to make him look like a saint
Will, thank you for showing us what growth and maturation looks like as we are all imperfect humans experiencing life.  But homie, you don’t owe anybody anything. ✊🏾
Crazy thing is I never stopped loving him I was just disappointed
Simple Fact, we all make mistakes and we all have our moments of weakness which causes shame and Will messed up but he is human, Now we can't ignore Chris' feelings on this, however, he can continue to punish or rise above it and i don't think it would take anything from him having a conversation with Will
Listen we all make mistakes. Nobody is perfect. Everyone deserves a second chance.
you are still one of my favorite actors, your sincerity shows, but Chris should also apologize because I find it pathetic that at this point comedy is still being made about someone else's body
Glad to see Will finally addressing this issue... even though I was truly disappointed in him for what transpired the one who was affected most by his actions was Chris.. My prayers for these two is that in time they can sit down and bring closure to this terrible incident.. I still believe there is some major healing to be done in both parties.. we can only wait and see.. I love them both and I pray that they in time can get pass this...
Surprised to see comments are on. Such a weird apology video, and definitely is not brave in any way. Interesting spin his PR people made conjuring this video. But, I wonder how much his next movie will make?
I still love you Will! Everyone makes mistakes.
Their daughter Willow is a complete narcissistic snob. My stepchild works at the _____ cafe that they are regulars at and everyone there hates when Willow comes in. She’s condescending, arrogant, rude and doesn’t tip. Treats them like they are nobodies.  I question the parenting skills, as well as the psychological issues of the parents themselves….if they let their child be that disrespectful to us “commoners”.
We love ya Will! ❤️‍🔥 we all human
Not buying it. Seems to me a desperate attempt to save your career. You've made many millions, maybe just stop being public. All of you (family). This is about ego.
I’m all about forgiveness when it’s sincere so I pray they can work it out! We all make mistakes. I don’t think it’s irreparable, I think they can heal and move on!
Very acceptable apology. we all do dumb things, im not sure if i would have gotten mad or not, but its not for me to judge you my man. Will i was mad at you for doing that but i still like you and your moves and music (that helped me survive my teens in the 80s) so all is forgiven from this white brother!
I’m gonna wait until Chris comes out and talks to put these negative feelings for Will away. I don’t think some scripted apology video changes my mind.
Stop blaming your past pain in the end we all make choices, we can be better than those that hurt us or be like them, having a bad past doesn’t give us the right to be hurtful, ugly or mean to those around us, yes we make choices according to our experiences but in the end it is our choice, you chose to walk up there and be aggressive instead of handling it like a grown man not a macho, that’s what I saw a macho not a man, until you heal and deal with that you’ll continue to get triggered by similar things/scenarios
Man you never let me down, we as humans go through stuff in our life that we which we could take back. But this is the time we learn from it and move forward with positive things. Don’t beat yourself down from this, people have done way more crazy things that they can’t even talk about. As a man we are to protect our family and at that moment that’s what you did. It was not the right thing to do, but that one moment it was. Now we grow from this , every one not just you mankind. We need to get back to showing each other love. Peace ✌🏽 Will I’ll never judge you or anyone, the mind is wild jungle we just need to stay on the path of love ❤️
Will is my guy for life man. We all make mistakes period!
Public apology... These apologies are never about the actual actions that took place but rather about wanting all those millions of people to make you feel good that everything is alright.
I can't think of the last time i've heard an apology I truly believe.
To be honest. This is too much. Yes it was not the best move. True. But hey. This man is a person. Got feelings. The bucket was to full at the moment. Yes he should apologize. Duh. But it is getting to big.
We love you and realize you are human. We are all human. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.  Your whole career you have been an upstanding man. I salute you. Please continue to heal and forgive yourself. Everything else is white noise. Peace love and healing ✌🏾🖤✨💫
I'd have found that tough. Humble, sincere... He's a good man with faults. It'll turn out ok - just will take time.
It is a start!
Hey man everyone makes mistakes he owned it and apologized so let's move forward
Accountability is key. Praying for you brother. 🙏🏾
only one thing for it, both of you train to become boxers and sort it out.
Will. You are forgiven and this was a wonderful step in the right direction. I hope for you peace my brother!
Did he ever really say "I am sorry"?
No! DO BETTER!!!!🤣
A little too late....no sympathy  for you,  is just remorse due to all the work cancellations, had it not be thar way you still be thinking it was cool and like your son/daughter said" This is how we do it"
Everyone deserves forgiveness, stop destroying people's lives over mistakes. Will is exceptionally talented actor and we need to see him in more movies. He learned his lesson it's enough.
We love you regardless, welcome back ❤️
While this is a step in the right direction, Will should be ashamed of himself. That said, the video was a good move.  Now Chris has to be the bigger man and formally forgive.
You can forgive but you can’t forget
Nice job, Mr. Smith 👏
Still backing you Will. Thanks for addressing this, and saying that you're sorry. Looking forward to a strong comeback!
This some sort of haughty image will never fade away from my eyes.   The only thing I see ever since the incident is rich people getting away with things they themselves learned and have known for a long time not to do.   But my loins of view probably matters 0%, so who cares howI see it
Fair enough Will. Well done. I hope the rest of the world can move on too.
Who hasn't make a mistake in their lives?   We are quick to judge, but we must realize what that person may be going through.
In so many ways I felt like I grew up with you. I popped your cassette tapes in elementary, even performed Nightmare on My Street at a talent show in 3rd grade. Your ascendance to mega stardom was always celebrated by me, and I can't deny I felt let down when this happened, but I know you are a human being, under extraordinary circumstances and pressure. I have certainly made awful mistakes in my own life, but I too endeavor to grow and learn and improve and share love while I am lucky enough to have the opportunity to. This statement may not have been owed to any of us, but I hear honest contrition, remorse and thoughtfulness. Kudos to you for doing the hard work and maintaining a positive spirit and vulnerability.
Will, this talk should be between you and Chris.  Resolve it first, and then get back to us about it.
Ah yes the obligatory YouTube apology video blaming one's problems on mental health
Yes let me do my corny apology video on my money-making YouTube channel, eat sjid will smith
that made me shed some tears. i felt that apology.
"I am sowy"   After getting his pockets hurt
This was really powerful. Thank you for sharing this Will.
Love Will💕💕
Before even watching this clip. Kudos for being brave enough to do this.
We love and stand with you Will! We've missed you so much
My guy will. Good to hear from him. I hope this all works itself out and everyone is cool in the end.
This is BS people..all this is about trying to get these tv/projects up and running..no money coming in
I still got love you bro! Thier is not one person in the comments section that's perfect we all done something
eu te perdoo will, bjo
Miss you Will!
We all make mistakes I met you at bet I am a makeup artisan and Chris  and I live in same building in bklyn I no his mother a lovely lady And forgiveness is in oder.
We all make mistakes and overreact sometimes. We also get second, third, fourth...whatever chances. I'm glad you apologized and I hope you continue to use your amazing craft 🙂
We all make mistakes. Let’s move on. @WillSmith forgive yourself. You know your heart. The best apology is changed behavior. I’m excited to see what’s to come in your future.
Take it easy will. Peace love
I feel like Will Smith might be Bojack IRL
I'm good with this video. It took some time to be made but at the end of the day Will doesn't really owe any of us an explanation. He reached out to Chris. Chris responded by saying he's not ready to talk yet. End of story. The two will either work it out or they won't.
Welcome back!
I’m sorry but I think that it was calculative, and he didn’t expect the backlash that’s been happening which I have no idea how far that’s reached. He rang a bell, and it can’t be undone
Accountability and you did that will . Now it's was up to Chris to accept that apology.
Yawn awww poor Will Smith isn't getting millions of dollars to make movies awww what a shame, hope the people of Ukraine are watching this and wishing him the best
Dude. You're human. And luckily rich enough to afford the best therapy. I think this came from the weight you put on yourself to be the perfect "golden boy". You f#$%ed up, do better, move on. Some will forgive you, some won't and you've got to be ok with that.
Friends Again!?  I never stopped being your friend and many of us have.  I want you to move on.  You said what you said that's it, that's enough.  Get back to the routine, fux anyone who don't want to see you move on and keep moving.  I miss ya please no more talk about this.  What's up Will it's been a minute, what you got for us?
Love me some Will! ♥️🤗
Is this an disguised ad for your water?
im happy that he is giving an apology, but this feels forced, i bet that he feels in his soul that this video is wrong
I wonder if he'll have this opinion if there wasn't soo much upcry.
Shout to him for leaving the comments open
This is absolute nonsense.
I won't get into too much but know this. Will continue doing u, many do still support you and have your back 100 percent. Not everyone feels the same way I promise you that..we know everyone makes decisions sometimes that later we all regret but you have apologized for them in front of everyone now so that's big of you to do. It really is all good I promise you, so know this will pass. Noone is perfect no matter how much they try to pretend they are...u will get through this with second chance. Thanks for showing us all the Man you really are inside and out. A kind and humble person, take care Will. ❤️
Go see Chris, enough public talking! Talk in private, apologize from the heart to him in person and from there as men figure out the best course for moving forward. Blessings to you both.
We all make mistakes will smith… great apology and very humble of you
For me, you are good. For Chris, I don’t know if you can fix that. We also all see that this was not a natural reaction, that part is the biggest issue.
❤
Good one.
Fake apology Fake actor he just can't get a role
Tell him in person not behind camera. Also, you made him look like a fool in front of the whole world.
Not a single man has been put through as much public scrutiny than Will, he has been made a meme like 10 times (especially over sensitive topics to himself) what he did was wrong but y’all want to talk about what Chris is going through but y’all also gotta talk about what Will went through and is going through. Saying I’m here to talk is the best response he could have given.
This is a good performance btw
I was shocked, but I also know if cameras were in my face 24 hours a day 365 days a year, they'd probably catch some bad stuff too. We all deserve grace. Every one of us. Sending good vibes.
To err is human, to forgive divine - Alexander Pope
My dude..keep your head and your heart in the right place. This to shall pass..🙏
Everyone: "We forgive you Will!"  Me: "One can not forgive if the deed isn't done to it. Once can only forgive if the deed is done to it"
How many writers worked on this Will?
The cross of Christ stands tallest and His mercies run deepest when we are at the point of our most vulnerable moment.   Jesus receives the humble heart seeking forgiveness and empowers a life to live more wisely in love in the aftermath of personal failure.   Look up Will. Trust the Lord. Walk with Him.
What you did, didn't change my feelings about you or your work.  We do all make mistakes.  People seem to forget that when you're in the public eye.  Much love everyone ❤️
Am I seeing this correctly?  Is Will marketing his water company during this time???? Is this more of a production or a transparent heartfelt apology???
Nope. Too little too late.
this is will smith that we all know standing up for his mistake and apologizing like a man time will heal all wounds hopefullly you and chris will be cool again
I think he’s acting rn
And his kid said this is how they do it. Utterly speechless but i’m glad he’s moving one step forward.
That was huge and very respectable of Will to do this. People make mistakes, emotions sometimes can take over. Will and Chris need to sit down face to face and squash this then both men move forward in there personal lives and careers. Let go and move forward. Love everybody. Let’s put this behind us
You are the man will. Always have and always be 💯
You should be in jail my friend. From PUERTO RICO.
You're not a nobody from nowhere, you're Will, we know you, we grew up with you, we understand. Chris didn't deserve this but neither did you, so hopefully he will give you a chance to make things right. Stay you!
Well since Will Smith is in the spirit of making apologies perhaps, he'll give me an apology and present it with a check made out to me as a gift in the amount of $5 million for the royalties he and Jeff stole from me. Not only have they stolen royalties from me they've also stolen my notoriety and blacklisted me. They ruined my career. How about an apology for that!  RRC
Not specific to Will, but I wish people would stop saying “mistake” rather than poor decision.
Dear Will,  You are human, you made a stupid mistake.  Your apology speaks volumes  and time will make this heal.  Do not be ashame as we all know that you are disappointed.  Take time to reflect.  We forgive you dude.  🙏🏽
bla bla bla, its just a face palm, happens, we are human beings, emotional creatures, sometimes we act on emotions ... "Chris wasnt ready to speak" cmon, grow up, BE MEN! MOVE ON!
Respect to him for apologizing. It won't change how I feel about him (most of it in the form of disappointment) but I do think he feels remorseful about the situation. Just don't know that my perception of his character can ever be changed since I don't know him personally, so I will never be able to speak to his character based on first-hand experience.   I do feel bad for him since I do think he is truly sorry, but I believe he will never be able to live this down and therefore have to deal with this the rest of his life.
How much of this is actual remorse and how much is damage control and pr?
Heartfelt apology brother. I thank you but I can't not see you differently.  That's far from my  judgment of you, as I'm "no one" to do that.  Rather, I own the idea that my feelings, perception or world view are but a part of the package encapsulating my witness to your unfortunate decision.  We all must make the conscious choice to engage in the business of doing the shadow work required of us all. It seems you're doing it!  I'd also like you to know that there IS forgiveness of course,  and as a fan and supporter I generously give you mine. Yet in a manner of speaking, mine is easy and quite inconsequential, as the "form" of my forgiveness--though  obscure,  impactless and superfluous it may be--would pale in comparison to the shape of those who must find their own capacity to do so, and my prayer is that they  all--those who were intimately impacted--do precisely that. Time does heal woundedness, and may you find an incomparable wholeness, and a level  of healing that allows you to ONLY see human beings as a reflection of you; the INSTANT should you experience a kind of testing such as this again.  I say this with the recognition that I too am speaking to my own reflected self.  😇 From brother to brother, I send to you much love and healing energy Will...and look forward to observing your next level of greatness and success.
Love you Will, welcome back
really ? you may have to talk to your son  Jadan he said " and this is how we do it" that was how he responded to this absolute ridiculous behavior
"Sorry Chris"?  "Chris, I'm sorry"?
🏋️‍♀️
Those Hollywood checks must be drying up.
xD
Definitely better to wait until you have thought it through before you make an apology for something like this, rather than apologising immediately when you're still angry and don't even know if apologising is the right thing to do, or to whom exactly you are apologising to.
He should’ve said the Hancock this at the end you know the I’ll try to better I will be better
Não  vejo sinceridade, o cara sentiu no bolso e tá tentando reverter a imagem negativa que ficou!  Esperou meses pra falar. Isso tudo é montado por consultores de imagem.
Fake
Peace love and respect to both Will and Chris.
So either Will Smith is the best actor ever or he really feels for this.   I hope they patch things up, it's hard to stay mad at Will
Was good that he did this. I love him again. Make some more movies baby!
When mistakes are made by ppl that are of celebrity status, it’s either overlooked or sensationalized. For the parties involved, I hope they find peace and healing for this 1 blimp within their lives. The rest of us are owed absolutely nothing.
Bring the dislike button back
Hope you’re having a great day remember no matter what you’ve been though or going through Jesus will always be there for you.
Remember folks: He is paid MILLIONS of dollars to pretend to be and feel things he isn't and doesn't; and he's so good at it, he just won an award for being THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT IT.
Get over it and move on
THE WHOLE WORD got hurt
Life’s tough on everyone regardless of status, you got heated and i assume it was a build up of a lot of things not just this moment in time. I get you probably do feel bad as i have when getting physical with people but this is 100% a PR thing.
Man this is some straight B.S. right here. This man is smirking and giggled during an "apology" video. FOH!
Hi Mr.Smith im older than u but because I dont know u personally....I call u Mr.Smith...most of us dont have millions of people watching us "when we have that moment"...but Wowwee what a moment...and I realize that u were in a role that u had just played on a movie screen....thats the feeling I got. After an actor plays a role in a movie and u r always superb.. how long does it take to release that character out your body?....You are a good guy and will always remain that person in our hearts...I say that for lots of us...take care Sincerely Gail
God willing your moments of loss will become your gift to the world
Doing an apology months later is fake asf Will u a 🤡
love❤❤❤❤
Apology respected.
When are you going to apologise for Men in Black II?
It's important to see celebrities for what and who they are... Which is human.  I have always looked up to and admired will, and even before this very public apology, I still do. He is human, he is a mortal man just like u and I. I just pray that he has a strong relationship with God and that he seeks forgiveness from our creator most importantly. I believe Will is very sincere and has been humbled from this experience. God bless him and his family, as well as anyone who's reading this. 🙏
Sounds sincere bro
I believe this was sincere , bro you didn't let me down cause unlike most folks what they don't see you're a human were allowed to make mistakes and we can forgive and move on with life .
I forgive you Will
Will!! Just relax, don’t let people put all that weight on you! You’re human, no one is perfect. Yes you are a celebrity and are on the spot, but that shows to all of us that no one is perfect. Move forward, god is blessing you every day, don’t waste time begging for forgiveness. That’s just toxic, stop explaining yourself, the ones who love you will understand and accept you above all.. keep walking!!!
L bozo
We’re all humans we make mistakes.
Who wouldn’t love this kind of a man. I knew this day would come and I am so proud of you Will. You’re doing great, it may not be the best but at least you learn from your mistakes and work hard to become a better human being 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I forgive you Big Willy x
we missed you so much
This feels like the Logan Paul Japan video apology.
Part of me feels like this is just damage control.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂ILUMINATTI PUPPET😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel your regret. I hope Chris can find it in his heart to forgive you.
“Remorseful without being ashamed”. That is arrogance speaking. Shame is a natural human emotion. If we had no shame we would be running around naked. Being remorseful without feeling shame is basically telling us I am only apologizing because I’m supposed to. Do you really mean it? You should feel bad about what you did. It doesn’t mean you don’t deserve forgiveness.
Will Smith is a phony. Come out and come clean Will.
Is it me or does he sound like the same Will Smith from 3 months ago? he’s still making excuses within his explanation and “apology”.
This guys ego is still way too massive lmfao
From the heart.
You really let Philly down man. Worse yet, you at least have some reference and respect for what it takes to be a comedian - you tried it yourself. So you should know what Chis' intentions were - to make people laugh and that's not easy. I really hope you find a way to make this better, not just for us and Chris, but yourself too. People love a comeback story.
No offense but Judas the trauma drop her she for the streets
Love heals all wounds with time. Good Luck Brother!
🙏🏽
I see in this man eyes that he tries to hard to be a people pleaser and has a very low self esteem. But his biggest problem is that he is a victim of a selfish, toxic woman.
Imagine doing something wrong Doing some self reflection & realizing you did something wrong Then having the courage to apologize for doing said wrong thing  (a lot of people don’t have the courage to apologize when they are wrong)  Then actually being forgiven🤍  We should actually forgive people  Because we all at some point in our lives will need forgiveness  Accountability  Apology Forgiveness  3 lost art forms in today’s society   I am in FULL support of Will Smith! Praying for his mental and emotional healing! And may he be freed from the stronghold of living up to peoples expectations of him. He is human and mistakes are simply apart of the human experience.
Dosser
I'm glad that at least you did this.  You hurt me with your actions.  I was one of your biggest fans.  We even met once at my aunt's one women play a  long time ago.
We all appreciate you and this apology. You're a good guy Mr. Smith. You're a good guy.
Everybody, everybody, everybody deserves a path to redemption. This is an excellent start.
You won't become a better person until you kick jada's butt out your life. Also earn chris rocks forgiveness first before you ask for the public's forgiveness.  QUESTION? HOW MANY TAKES DID YOU MAKE BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO POST THIS ONE?
I LOVE YOU MAN, REAL TALK. You are Awesome AF. Big Ups for Being who you are Flaws and ALL. You had a human moment, it was caught on cam. You are not nor never will be " A peace of Dudo". You Will Smith has help me do so much for myself, and you fam Omg. Your the example of "I can and Will". Don't forget that, bruh. I LOVE YOU MAN, I FORGIVE YOU, AND YOUR PEOPLES TOO. 💝😇🙏👏💪 Send you a boat load of LOVE and LIGHT!!
3:07 "I'm sorry babe" are you f*cking kidding me
A reminder of how we humans can make mistakes, learn from our mistakes, and evolve positively for the better.   Nobody can knock on Will Smith after this video.
Will, I hope you can see this as constructive criticism. actions speak louder than words... perhaps a louder action is needed to overcome the action that hurt so many people in addition to Chris. Perhaps doing something equally shocking, but good, in Chris's honor? Something like that would compel Chris to talk to you. Apologizing is good, but without a solution of actions, the words will not be enough.
Will Smith? Just let Chris smack you in the face publicly. Then everyone can laugh it off and move on.
You explained that wonderfully. Glad to see you’re working to make things right.
I do not have a camera follow me all day long. I say to myself that I am special. Make mistakes all day long. Judge not and you shall not be judge.  Who have not sinned to cast that stone. This too shall pass.  We know we will in a imperfect world. Will you took accountability now you can move forward. I still support you. Stay connected to the Most High. Peace, love, and light.
Love you Will
Making a mistake isn’t a scarlet letter, but just a moment in time.
❤️
It took a lot for Will to do this. He owned it. Let’s move on.
Much Respect Will!
Downvote regardless
Chris is milking the situation
It only was a great person having a shitty  moment. We all have those but not in front of a camera. Life goes on. Let's go.
There are times when a man stands his ground. It's not the same situation or time for everyone. We are all human, and we all have feelings. Will Smith has been a role model from day one while growing up in this industry with longevity. You are an amazing man Will.
Thank you for addressing this
I love you will! 🫶🏼 We are human! You got this! 💪🏼 don’t overthink about this situation what happened, happen and unfortunately it can’t be changed but you learn from this and be better and that’s what we gotta stick with. ♥️ You are an amazing person!
Seriously?! You don't want to feel shame?! That's how we as humans overcome and learn from our mistakes. No shame no gain brother. That doesn't mean we have to feel shame forever. Shame is purifying. Shame is central part of empathy. When we hurt someone and allow ourselves to emphatically feel their pain, that's shame. Narcissists will do ANYTHING to avoid feeling shame. They choose to avoid it rather than truly be the empathic person the world needs them to be. So please, Will, please allow yourself to feel shame. Allow the fire of shame to purify you. When the pain of your shame exceeds the traumatic pain you caused others, will you be free.
The people in this comments section harping on about religion and prayers and peace. "Prayers to you Will...." Massive eye roll to all of that. He doesn't need or deserve anyone's sympathy.  He wants his career and reputation back and that is all.  It is massively narcissistic to come on here and put out an apology video when the only person he needs to apologise to does not want to speak to him.  He should accept that Chris does not want his apology now, or possibly ever.  This man is so up his own arse he can't see the right thing to do anymore.  This is not the right thing to do.  This is the vain, self-obsessed thing to do.
Jesus said to 'Love Thy enemy'; but he didn't say you have to take their call or be nice to them.
Looks like pretty good acting to me
We support you 100% we love ❤️ you
People fuss, fight and mess up everyday. It's what you do afterwards that counts. Repent/Forgive, move on and learn from your mistakes. ❤
Let Chris smack you back!
What he think about Kendrick Lamar
Rough to realize what u lost, after working so hard to gain it, all for something so insignificant. And then try to figure out how to save it.
Good work! I look forward to seeing the great things that you will do.
Can we just please let this go!! It’s such a big deal because it’s Will and Chris! First of all, we need to realize that celebrities are real human people with feelings just like the rest of us. Give them both some grace. They’re not perfect by any means and neither are we as humans. Apology has been given. Doesn’t matter how long it took for him to say it. It’s not our place to judge him and say his apology is not genuine. It’s Chris’ decision to accept it or not. There are so many other important life issues and things going on in this world to be continually plagued by the past. Release this man and leave him alone!! He knows what he did. He’s living with it daily. Say a prayer for everyone and everything and keep it moving!! It’s over! It’s done! Move on please! People are acting as if they were directly involved. This is between Will and Chris. Give them their privacy and space to work it out. Yes it happened publicly; but so does so much other sh** too!! Get over it! Peace and blessings to you all!
I have mad respect for you, Will. It takes a lot of courage to do this. You are a light in this world. You teach us so much. Even now, you're teaching us to love ourselves as we learn from our mistakes. Praying that your heart heals. 🤍
Admitting the wrong behaviour is the first step, i wish u the best and i wish u a life without stress and regret.
It’s kind of f up that one split moment of emotion can be used to try define one’s character.  I wish you luck   Mr.Smith .
I still love you Will…. Even though I’m a complete stranger.
the hell going on here.  he made a mistake. talk to Chris And his fam and apologize to the nominees and winners for stealing the spotlight for a min and move on.  tf.  he don't owe nobody else ish. this stuff happens every day. just people saw it. you still a brotha from Philly.   hold ya head and keep it moving.  you said it. " I'm human".  now move on bruh.  it's over.  don't beat ya self up
You should have apologize in that moment what you did shame on you you neeed Jesus Christ I mean real Jesus Christ not Hollywood jesus
There we go, its all fuzzy.
At the end of the day Wil Smith is a human being, its just we as fans and supports expect more from him than how he reacted, nevertheless he is human he makes mistakes we all make , yet he was before the world , I feel in time we will come to forgive him, I do.
Will, remember the action is separate from the person.  The action was bad, you are not bad.  Big hugs.
Don't hurt forever Will. Forgive yourself. Love You
The world needs to learn how to apologise, how to take ownership. How actions and words need to match, may your journey serve to teach many. You never lost me, I always knew that you are strong enough to show the world how to be accountable and move forward… Mad love xxxx
I couldn't understand why you did what you did, but I understand we all fall into that and make a poor choice in the moment. I hope everyone can come together and work out what happened and go on to find a forgiving and friendly outcome. What the world needs is kindness, love, and support for one another to blind out the evil that's taking over. Bless you Will so happy to see you.
Dang, your still with her😒
Did you let your  kids know, that this was so wrong? Because they approved, so are they going to behave the same in the future?
He just mad his son turned out like that 💯
Ok, we’re good 👍 Good luck with Chris 🙏💯
Only bad thing that it happened on that prestigious stage..
❤️
Keep trying to do the best you can with this and hopefully not only Chris as well as the rest of the world will see that we all fall short of grace. Your fan's know you are human and we see continue to raise from your mishandling of the situation. Keep being the best you that you can be. Big fan and looking forward to seeing even more great works from you. 👍🏿✊🏿👏🏿🙏🏿
Respect your transparency and willingness to take responsibility for your actions! Always supporting you.
That's what we call living with our mistakes. you are absolutely right we are all human and we are perfectly imperfect now we just have to learn from our mistakes and become better every day .
I have made a severe and continuous lapse of judgment vibes
everybody looses their chill from time to time. and will is doing the right thing and saying "I messed up." good on him.
Just leave her bro
My opinion does not matter, but defending your wife's honor does, and I feel you have nothing to apologize for sir.
Will made a choice, and he cant' come back from that choice.   He is not fit to be in the public light, end of story.  Find something else to do in life.  There's plenty of amazing activities in life you can do with the money you have.    You being in the spotlight, like you were, is not one of them.   IMHO.
This felt very genuine. My heart still hurts from the pain that moment caused everyone, Will included.
I lost all respect for this person , he used to be one of my fav actors. I will never watch his films. There is no excuse.
Not that serious bruh him n Chris just need to get some drinks and go on vacation n do sum fun lol
A good look from Will.
Will needs to speak out now because new Fresh Prince is starting soon and needs to start in a positive way...
In a minute, I’m a need a sentimental man or woman to pump me up.
💚💚💚💚
Can't imagine having to go through that social hurricane. You're definitely set apart for a very unique human schooling. Glad to see you again. You've always been a curiosity to me in the depth of your passion.
Hey man, we've all made mistakes, some small, some big, and most of us were lucky they weren't caught on camera for millions to see. Welcome back, Will.
Do you know what I think if someone is stressed they often take their frustration and stress out on the wrong people
Boooooo
NOBODY IS PERFECT ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. WE JUST HUMAN BEING WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES. HOPE CHRIS ACCEPT UR APOLOGIES. CUZ U BOTH ARE AMAZING INDIVIDUALS WE LOVE U GUYS. WE WANNA SEE U GUYS HAPPY AGAIN THANK YOU 🙏
This is phony as all get out. You're sorry because there were consequences for your actions, posting a youtube video is your way of doing damage control. Apologize to Chris personally, none of us need to see this, you're just saying it for your own image. You're clearly reading from a script, you're clearly 'prepped' for these questions, and you're not even answering these questions like a real person. It's all prepared PR. It's been months, and you've 'worked on yourself'. Great, but an apology that comes this late ain't worth much.  Good luck in the future, but this whole video comes across as BS.  Sincerely,  A former big fan of yours.
Ayeee
You really once stood for something brother. And I know that man is stil in there. We see the scars, and that’s ok. We also know the ointment for it. Let her go. Please. Before she destroys what’s left of you. We the people, who love you, are begging at this point.
We still look up to you for being a human
Love you Will. Don't accept this in your life. Best wishes.
Its good to have you back.  Whether Chris accepts your apology or not, that is his choice.  I appreciate you owning up to your issues and moving forward.
I can honestly say he never let me down, he never disappointed me, he did what he thought was right at the time (which was wrong) to protect his wife's honour (even tho she didn't ask for ) but that's a husband's/fathers job, to protect his family. I have done similar things in the past and when I looked back I knew it was wrong. Would I go back and undo it ??, hell no, the reason??? It stopped people from talking negatively or making fun at my family's expense, It made them realize my family is out of bounds!!!!
Big difference between "what happened" and "what I did." Big difference between "the people who got hurt" and "the people I hurt." All throughout this, I only hear the first version. Lots of words, still not actually owning the consequences of behavior or being accountable for the hurt caused. This is a great teachable moment about making amends ..or not in Will's case.
Sad thing is the fact he's having to apologize to the public,  and not just Chris. It's nobodys buisness except for there's. Let's just be real. You guys be expecting celebrities to do way more then entertain.  They're entertainers,  they owe you nothing except entertainment
😆
Carlton Pearson once told a story of a beloved church member in her Alzheimer phase ask him are "You Still Yet Holding On". Carlton Person replied  "Am Still Yet Holding On" "Will" hold on💜
Will Smith will get a 2nd chance, he's too big to fail.
Just focus on things you did right in life , forget about that situation, life goes on
Turns out you can take the Philly out of the kid. Take your millions of dollars and just go away.
My lifelong mentor. Man has been a role model to men, women and children for so long! He broke and he's broken. All of us have to forgive as we're forgiven. God bless Will, his fam and you all.  💯
Are his kids going to apologize for bragging about Dad's behavior?
Hurt people, hurt people.
Bro, ive been following your works since i was a child, so few actors in hollywood that we (a whole black generation) could feel as a family, therefore we were like numbed by the fact you were in a pickle... but as a family we are (your fans, and people who love you and respect you) we need to stand by you aknowledging... that you are A HUMAN and you can absolutely mistake (like we all do) so... respect to you, and to chris... keep it up bro. you are the voice of a generation (and probably a lot to come) so...thanks for this will.
This could be a sincere apology or a desperate move from him to save his career because he admitted himself the fact that there's been a lot of heat on him and his family.Difficult to say as he is such a great actor.Either way, we all make mistakes and people should take this into consideration before jumping so quick to judge him.
He needs to divorce that Woman.
It For Sure Has Will Smith Bro
Well this seems super insincere lol
Last 3 month were the toughest for Will Smith....no projects, no movies...but reality kicked in. He realized and now he is doing the right thing.
This is for God to know whether he is acting or telling the truth. I forgive him.
I have always respected your transparency Will and your willingness to teach while on your journey. It’s not easy to share your most painful lessons. We all make mistakes and fall sometimes,  it’s how we get back up and continue moving forward that sets us apart. Continued blessings. 💫
I guess I’m not a real fan. Still pissed at him. Maybe when Chris accepts his apology I might see this different. Just sayin.
Let’s see if Hollywood forgives will… will bad boys 4 and several other project quietly pop back up
Apology or shoring up the brand?
that sigh at the start, if he had a dog in shot I would have said this was a true youtuber apology
Love you Will, praying for your well-being. No one is perfect. While I don’t agree with what you did, I don’t see you as that one act. I still think you’re great. You are still God’s child and you’re figuring out this thing called life like everybody else.❤
He apologized and is human. God forgives, so should we.
We moved on…. You should too
Even Will Smith is human. Chris has been a class act and I hope someday they'll both be able to get passed this and have a amicable relationship.
He seems sincere, everyone makes mistakes… I think forgiveness is the right thing and with that he has excepted his wrong doings and has learned a valuable lesson. Forgive but never forget and move forward
What an entitled jerk this guy is. The whole family is. You know Chris is much more talented than you, so you had to show him up. Shows Will's deep insecurity
Sounds false to me. I don't mean he's lying, but I think he is still so distant from his heart that he's out of touch with all this. His voice sounds hard and angry. There isn't the softness that comes with actual acceptance of what you did and how it affected the other. He's still talking all about himself and in his head, using jargon like "unpacking" this. I've had apologies given that felt very real, and ones that didn't. you just know the difference. And I've given real ones and ones that at some level weren't real too. He's got the wrong therapist
I'm glad I saw this in my Notifications... Dislike and unsubscribe lol
❤
Everyone makes mistakes. We love you Will.
Some of us don’t fall off so easy! We still got you Will🙏🏾🌹🥰💯
u should have cried bro . it will be a better appology  lool
Hopefully Chris will one day forgive him.
Que todos sintam o real arrependimento que ele expressou neste vídeo. Um abraço 🤗
no... i made a choice... on my own... from my own experiences
Will, espero muito que você fique bem, tudo que acontece em nossa vida é para um aprendizado e propósito. Mesmo nos momentos mais felizes coisas ruins podem acontecer, mas não se esqueça quem você é, não se esqueça das pessoas que depende de você e todos os princípios que você defende. Você é Forte!!! Amo você!!,❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Is Will sorry for what he did or sorry because he let people down?
Proud of you Will. Way to own up without destroying yourself. You will always have deep eternal worth as a son of God. Continue to let the Truth set you free.
This world has become so quick to judge and condemn without looking with in and really judging ourselves. Are we really so morally better than the next human, that the moment they make an error we attack. We must all be responsible for ourselves and live accordingly. We all have to live together on this 🌎 peace.
✌☮
We love you Will! 🤎🙏🏽
#freepalestine
Everyone has that moment. You're seen as the nice guy all your life but when it comes to your family you stand up for them. He just went about it wrong. You only can take so much and he made a mistake.
The room is almost more a mess than the man
It sounds like BS 🤷🏻‍♂️
Too little, too late. It’s been months. Will just realized he was not going to land any new jobs unless he “feigned” regret. So disappointed in the way he handled all parts of this situation.
You have always been a good guy.  I know we all have moments and I don't understand why this happened but you are willing to get better.
Mad respect Will. Love you bro.
This is what it is to be a man
I'm sorry but I call buuuuullshhit...!!!
Should have made a private video and sent it to Chris, then only publicly posted this video once Chris already forgave you.   This seems like a video made for the benefit of Will’s reputation, not for the actual healing purposes.  Now Chris is pressured publicly to forgive him. Not so cool
On you're side,aways will
I hope everyone involved heals and moves on. I wish everyone peace, healing and happiness.
;) keep your head up man... peace
L VIDEO
Sorry, Will. You lost my faith and following.
I will always love Will Smith! He made a mistake. How long does he have to pay for this mistake?
You’ve done everything right since that moment. You had a highly emotional moment that got the best of you and you shouldn’t have to keep paying for that. Keep on keeping on and go make some more amazing movies and specifically more of those Disney nature episodes. ❤️
So proud of you, Will.  You were put in an extraordinary situation and you reacted.  The only thing your action proved is that you are a human being, like the rest of us.  That you apologise and recommit to your purpose of putting love and joy into the world is all any of us could do. The love and respect of those who are authentic will be with you, always.
This is how you apologize and come back!
❤️❤️💪🏽💪🏽 This brings tears 😢😢😢 Truly sorry to hear all of this.. That you put yourself into this massive situations with so many.. Now this have  happened to you yet and to your family with so many, and now so many want to know... So Where does this go for you NOW? WILL THIS IS A QUESTIONS FOR YOU.. KEEP STRONG BUT YET HUMBLE Hope you getting the help you yearning for right now. much luv and peace any body suffering seek help through God 💯💯🙏🏽🙏🏽
hey will since bad boys 1 you were my fev actor and still. so for all of those dramatic people who want to judge willie go do something useful in your f up life instead of bitching about chris subject . the man apologiezd and he already feel sorry for what he had done on that stage. that being said... to my fev actor will smith there is non more u can do about it its done and keep roolin my man we all humans and we all make mistakes my man. peace
People can change 🙂
I hope Chris will forgive him and if not just clear the air and move on.
There was no point in him apologizing in his speech if he wasn’t sorry then. He had to sit and think about it. That can happen.    Way too many people apologize for the public but they don’t mean it. Will is apologizing now because he means it.
💞
Why he talkes like it’s scripted haha
Fun fact so far this has 17k dislikes
I'm glad he apologised about the incident  and I understand that everyone makes mistakes. Will is an amazing and outstanding actor and I hope to see him in more movies soon
I'LL NEVER WATCH ANY MOVIE WITH YOU IN IT
✨🙏✨
That took a lot to do and you can feel the heat of honesty coming off of the screen. So I won't type a bunch of BS here now but instead try to be as genuine back. We've all been in situations that just happen and the next thing you know our world is tilted off rotation dragging everything with it. It almost always seems like it's a monumental catastrophic end of the world. But it never really is and eventually we figure that out and learn how to balance better for the next time. Will has always been a genuine guy and an absolute pleasure to ride along with in my years of watching him. I think a lot of us would have done the same (not quite as ballsy on tv) but we understand the reaction and it's unwrapping. My very best wishes to you Will if you read this. I'm honest when I say I really hope your all good and the dust settles for you. Blessings my famous friend.
All love Big Willy! May you continue your journey. 🙏
Will said his apology. Now it's time for you all to accept it
If you are … Stop reading these comments, forgive yourself. Cause you are forgiven ❤️
Yes you are human brother do not worry you will be fine
Damn this whole thing is hard. As a husband I feel him. As a man you own up to your mistake. We’re all humans even will smith. One love.
Mans got blacklisted in holly wood,  can't get no movie rolls so now its time to be sorry lmao.
When a man gives a sincere apology you forgive him. I can understand Chris needing more time but it is my hope that there will be forgiveness and reconciliation.
Please Mr. Smith, don't torture for that moment. It was a bad reaction but a reaction. I too would do the same, but we are only humans, not robots. Follow your life the best you can do, make movies or music, or whatever, but forget that crazy moment.
We all lose our temper when we least expect it sometimes.  It's human nature to make mistakes.   The important part is admitting fault and learning from the mistakes we make.  A real man apologizes!  A POS not only deprives the one they hurt an apology, but also refuses to admit ever doing any wrong.
I applaud you Will.  What you said sounded sincere and appears you have taken ownership of what happened.  Keep your head up.  Hopefully, you and Chris can have a heart to heart talk and that he will forgive you when he is ready.
Take my sandwich out yo mouf… 🤣🤣🤣
He acts numb from the stress and turmoil brought by Jada’s bald head
You done Chris foul
No acting can be this good. I feel him deeply. may your inner light grow from within you Will Smith, hug you and forgive you from within. without begging, forgive and love that inner child that lashed out in a grown man body dealing with grown man consequences, and as you are loved unconditionally from within, you manifest forgiveness and unconditional love without. Ase broHam. 🤗Amun Ra, Amin. #resurrection.
Appreciate you and everything you've done. Keep your head up as best you can.
I'VE LOST ALL MY RESPECT TO YOU
First of all, if there is no part of you that thinks that was the right way to behave, then why did you do that?  Part of you does think that was the right way to behave, otherwise you wouldn't have done that.  Secondly....3 months?  Seriously?  You should have done this video THAT NIGHT.  Or the next day at least.  I really hope you're right that this is irreparable.
❤️❤️❤️
Still got love for you Will. ❤️You are human. We all go through stuff it's unfortunate that yours happen on stage but you will get through this❤️Much Love❤️❤️❤️
No matter what uncle will I love you!
It takes a lot for a human to genuinely apologize and take accountability props
I apologize to my family and kids on this video for everyone to see…psssh! Gtfoh!!
Proud of you Will , takes a hell of a man to push his Ego aside . A lot of men should learn from this , SORRY doesn't mean you are weak  just human.
Good apology.  I do hope you get to say 'I am sorry' to him in person.  I've apologized many times but wasn't sorry.  And shame... being ashamed of yourself is not a bad thing.
Will you are my man ✌
🥂 to choosing to live@ the highest frequency...Love❣️Most importantly self-love, it raises the vibration worldwide 🌍. You being a piece of $hit 🤯... Dont Be Silly Willard!! We've all been distracted & sometimes fallen short of the expectations of others. Ur learning wut triggers u 👏🏽👏🏽 & hopefully setting healthy boundaries. As we r all a wrk in progress...ya dig😉 Keep up the inner wrk 💪🏽 it looks good on u! Not even u could ruin My Will Smith experience Sir lol. So I'm hanging on & can't wait for I Am Legend✌🏽🥰.
Will, thank you. It isn't a matter of making a mistake, it is a matter of what you do after that mistake.  There are no angels no matter what anyone says.  Thank you Will for being honest, transparent and willing to show your heart to the world allowing all to move on.  Respect.
❤️
Now can y’all please leave my big bro alone. He makes one mistake after all these years. Been so above reproach all these years  folk forgot he was human. It’s giving earth vibes. One mistake will never define will or any of us. We are not robots. Welcome back Big Will!! Your worst fear of not being perfect has arrived. So now that that’s been realized nothing else can stop you. You’ve reached the other side! And you know what that means. The best years of your life are on the horizon! You made it. ❤️
F him, it was criminal what he did. No complexities just wrong. And YOU destroyed the entire event for everyone. Your a jerk off William Smith
Chris needed his own apology
3 months 5 min ....no thanxs
I think this video was so important for everyone, even though it is really a private matter between him and Chris. So many of us looked up to Will Smith as a cultural icon, and to see him do what he did was depressing and disappointing. We rarely get to see a major cultural and political figure own up to and try to amend mistakes, and to see this is a healing experience.
No one is perfect and we have all done things that make others question our character…. But that shouldn’t determine our entire existence of character and goodwill. I hope both of you gentlemen come together for forgiveness and mending.
You're still my guy Will. All you can do is put in the work, apologize and become a better person from it.
Glad you're apologizing and trying to do better. Hope you come back to Hollywood soon. Hopefully your comeback film is The Ayer Cut. #ReleaseTheAyerCut #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Good job Will. One thought: it's appropriate for us to be ashamed of ourselves sometimes. Of course we don't want to take this too far, but when we make mistakes it's good for us to be ashamed of them. All that means is that we acknowledge we're not perfect. But it also doesn't mean we're merely a piece of crap. If Christianity is true, and I believe it is, then there's a sense in which we're all made in the image of God and thus have the potential for greatness. However, according to Christianity we're also all flawed in different ways and recognizing that is the first step in reaching out to God for forgiveness through faith in Christ. Consider Jesus' parable: in Luke 18:9-14 - To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”
Glad he apologized. Ashamed yes, I would feel beyond ashamed.
Much love to you Will always
Bye Felicia
Niobe will be proud.
He gave real emotional and thoughtful answers/explanations here. Bravo.
Don't be hard on yourself live and learn aye. I'm sure we are all over it and I'm sure he should be too!
You're human and allowed to make mistakes.
I forgive you Will. I been over it. I will support your next movie.
I'm beginning to feel proud of you once again, Will. Stay on that journey of redemption. I know Chris, in the end, will help you reach the summit again. God Bless You!
The genie
The man made a mistake ....let me know if you never made one so I don't have to #### with you
We all fall down and we get up again no human is not inhumane to mistakes we learn from this and take that lesson like a mustard seed  and grow from this we take that to handle another situation in a different way.Everyone asking questions wanting to know something that was in your train of thoughts and emotions at that point you have rooted yourself in emotional growth and took time out to find out who you really are and own up to your mistakes it takes a real man to hold his head up and take accountability but it takes a even man to know when to say sorry. We will always support you as we were fans in the beginning and we will be fans until the end.
One bad judgment doesn’t change my view of Will.  He’s always been a fun loving happy go lucky kind of celebrity. I have been a fan since the beginning and will remain a fan.
You said in your own words...  "I want to apologize to Chris' Mother" and "Chris' Family" and others. But WHERE IS THE APOLOGY!?  What you want to do vs. DOING IT is a huge difference.  If you wanted to apologize...  It should've sounded something like this....  "Chris' Mother, I am sorry and I apologize to you for my behavior/action." Will Smith SAY IT. Issue the apology.... don't just say what you want to do.
**taps mic** ...President Will Smith, presiding.
We only human in the end of the day.
Too little, too late. But I guess you gotta try something when big studios are hesitating to back you and you've lost the respect of many
Damage control. 🙄
This is all pr FAKE
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you bro !!!   We here !
Super dope that he apologized and did it on a public platform instead of trying to keep things behind closed doors considering what happened was also in public.
Wait....what happened????
💜
Will you are a beloved person, and a legend in our eyes! We ALL fall short, act impulsive, and have major regrets in our lives. Please don't be hard on yourself! You have apologized to Chris and his family, stick to God and move on! You're good!
You should be ashamed for a such a shameful act, that's also part of being a human.
Look will we’re all human and we all make mistakes I also accept your apology
Respect✊🏿
All people make mistakes like you said your human this doesn’t define who you genuinely are. Your a beautiful soul inside & out! #willsmithfan4life 🤍
I appreciate that you understand how it affected everyone
Proud 🥲 of you
We are all human what matters is how you stepped up to take responsibility for your behavior and doing the work to correct it! Stay humble, believe in yourself once again and continue to grow being the best you can be!
Dr. Ramani definitely coached you and I’m glad she did. It takes a grown man to do therapy and to be vulnerable.
He’s a good actor, i’ll give him that.
Idk man… this still don’t sit right with me bro
Whatever you say Slapopecia    I got Rocks Back
We love you Will!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💖
Man I was a missing you brother 😪 really really
It was not that serious he should not apologize
We love you Will!
Way to make it all about yourself. Embarrassing.
God forgives. But such an humiliation, it deserves more than apologies to a real man. It deserves trial by combat.
We're human it's within our nature to make mistakes, stand up and move on will, we still love you 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Will Smith is a walking L
Okay.
He must have just got dressed, he forgot to tie his shoes.
Seems redundant
Sometimes shame is necessary
You finna go on red table talk my nigga?
I completely understand and grant you the grace that we are all seeking when we make a mistake. If we learn to stop putting people on a pedestal and to allow them their humanity, it would be much easier to give grace as it is due to us all. We live and we hopefully learn.
why is he lowkey laughing?
@Will Everybody makes mistakes and may regret the consequences for their actions. But everybody should also be able to make a sincere apology like this to show you're human and can make a stupid mistake too. Hopefully Chris will accept your apology and you can leave this behind you. Chris surely knows you're a good man and you made a mistake in the heat of the moment. Goodluck to both of you.
First step was the instagram post. Next step is this video.   I am liking this. The act of showing responsibility and remorse of his actions is truly magnificent.   As someone who is a fan and felt extremely disappointed at what happened I can agree to say that I will hold on to one day become that fan again.
Why did you go to an after party and celebrate the night of the incident? The weirdest part about the situation is that you sat there afterwards and pretended like nothing just happened.
❤
Sending ❤❤❤❤❤🇿🇦
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself" Some serious accountability right there
Dude, I can’t imagine what this had been like for you and your family. Keep working!
When your PR team makes you apologize 👀
Next please, there are more important in this world . Excuse done, fine . Next .
of course Will smith turned the incident into a Q&A vlog
He still needs help.
Good acting on his part. Well written and rehearsed. I almost believe it.
Lol so why don't you send this without all the publicity and camera work? The public doesn't care about your privilege. You're just looking to get in the public's good graces to sell us another movie.
Why he got on that Wario hat?
It is human to error yet divine to forgive. I hope everyone comes out of this stronger then they were before. The strongest iron is forged in fire.
That woman has scarred him so badly that he keeps deflecting the real issue in his life which is her
I just can't understand why he's still with that harpie. It's ruining him.
📌Ahhh. Reparations?  Cut Chris a guaranteed check for a future film you BOTH star in? I’ll forgive and forget for the sake of you and Chris moving forward.   Who’s in? 👍🏾
Will should also have his son think about his “and that’s how we do it” tweet.  When a person has a fan base, they need to think about what they put out there.
Let he who is without sin...pass the first stone. No judgment here Will.
Months later? Lol
Will, I've been reading your book, and learning about you. What you've experienced, and now what you've expressed are indicative ~ to me, that you're fighting a battle. I don't think it's a coincidence that after writing your book, working on a movie where you're protecting children, and whatever else you were working on that I don't know about, that situation brought it all to a head. I believe you to be a genuine man, I believe you to be better and better as time wears on. As long as you try; and I've seen how you commit yourself, I know this too shall pass. Peace and love from ~ just a fan.... ❤
You should have did this that night while accepting your award. You are wrong on every level and I view you differently.
W apology👏🏿👏🏿
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
It's ok Will, we all make mistakes. Glad that you are going back to your true self. Have a talk with Chris. You both need it.
No one should be defined by a sinlge act. People are complex and this man hopefully recognizes what he did was wrong
This was kinda weak. You wait forever to apologize then do it in a controlled forum where your asking yourself questions smh lol
🗑
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
He needs Andrew Tate
Respect!!!
Every being in existence makes mistakes, that's why we're here.
Are you still apologizing to her?!?! The F grow a pair
We all human, love that you apologize and it’s seems like you truly mean it
Love you!
"I'm trying to be remorseful", he says as he doesn't act even the least bit remorseful through this entire apology video
I feel as if this is why I could never be an "evolved" person, because I wouldn't be apologizing. I may not have decided to do it again but I wouldn't be apologizing and maybe that's a personal issue but if I do something, I own it unapologetically. So I wouldn't be apologizing to anyone. 🤷🏾‍♀️
You are an amazing human you have shaped a lot of peoples youth … no one’s perfect
Why this take you so long?!?
And respect cuz you could have cut off the comments to respect
It's good that your trying to make peace with what happened. But I think more of a blessing for yourself if you tackle what the real issue with your real demons. ❤️
Will, you disappointed us big time. I grew up watching you since i was 5 years old. We really looked up to you. Glad you apologised to not only Chris, but his mother too. Damn.
PR is deleting negative comments.
This should have been a hand written letter given to Chris not a youtube video though, would have probably meant more. Hollyweird seems to forget that they are people first, acting is just their job. Should not matter for any of us to hear this... yet here we are.
Good job. Chris also needs to apologize. Chris was bullied in his younger years . It’s not okay for him to now make a career of bullying people. That also is not okay but no one is saying that.
I'm proud of you Willard Smith! You are a very wonderful man so, please 🙏 I want you to be able to heal honestly.   Hurt people do hurt people.  With all this chaos happening in this world 🌎 I hope you can listen to Kendrick Lamars the Heart Part 5 . It was so beautiful. I know you'll love it so much! I adore you uncle Fluffy! Remember..... No human is perfect 👌  Always stay true to yourself King. May God Bless 🙌 🙏 ✨️ ❤️ 💖
why does it start like a youtube apologie video
Will you are a good dude. Never been an activisit trying to divide people. You have always brought people together no matter the race or political beliefs. Glad to see you grounding yourself again. We need more of this in today's society from all walks of life.
We forgive you will.
I never thought I'd see the day where celebrities would be making youtuber styled apologies lmafo
Nah...
You’ve always been an inspiration Mr. Smith and still are we all make mistakes I’m glad your doing well man!!!!!
You are still taking yourself too seriously. Tone down the sanctimony.
Ight bet~Chris
I believe you're healing the country with this...well it's a start!
4 months to late homeboy
It DEEPLY saddens me that it's been three months and this man still hasn't been able to catch a break! His apologies were heartfelt and genuine!
Fail
Love you Will! No one here is perfect and it’s just unfortunate your moment had to go down like that. But never will I let that outshine all the incredible things you’ve done and I feel as though overall you truly are great man who just made a mistake. Wishing you the best!
Lol nice $30 advertisement under the apology video
So finally Will Smith has also completed the Youtube creator rite of passage where a fun loving Youtuber stars by posting some high on energy content, gets his audience, does something really evil, goes off the grid for sometime, comes back with a very serious apology video talking really slow and then just go back to being a jerk once again!
AAAA CUCK LMAOOOOO
Will, you've always been one of my favorite artists on TV, the big screen or just coming through the speakers with your latest album. My words will likely never make it to you but please keep in mind that we are all human and we all make mistakes. Emotions are such a great thing to experience but, like a double edged sword, they can make us do stupid things and impair our judgement. Yes, what happened was shocking to all of us but I believe it should be seen as a moment of weakness and seeing the effort you are putting in to right the wrong speaks more of your character than the incident itself.  I believe I understand Chris and his family for not being ready to talk about it, however, I think in time and with work on yourself they will come to see things in a different light. I think you are showing great strength in acknowledging your actions and digging in to identify the deeply rooted issue and work to understand it and better yourself and, to be honest, most of us could learn a thing or two from that.  Thank you for just being you and showing us your true thoughts and emotions on this. Keep your head up and know that anyone who takes the time to be understanding rather than judgemental is rooting for you to get back on your feet and back to living your best life bringing light to those around you.
Will this be in the 2022 YouTube rewind though?
I appreciate the apology but I feel like there’s so much more to unpack.
Bless you my  brotha...and may God forever bless you and yours. LOVE is always the answer
We still love you Will 💜
We are all human and make mistakes, sometimes those mistakes come from emotion.   Much love to you Will, I’m sending you good vibes, peace and comfort. Every thing will work out in the end.
Someone YTP this video pleaaaaaaaaase!! 😅😅😅😅
All we can do is try again and do better going forward. When you don't do that you've f'd up. Just my opinion.
Will I still love you and I will always and forever be a big fan of yours.  You're only human and every human has  their breaking point.
Will is upset over the consequences he has had to endure. Nothing more. If the jobs kept coming in, there wouldn't even be this ill-timed garbage apology.  Edit: You should be ashamed of yourself. Count me as one of those people who used to look up to you.
I wouldn't say I wished he was dead, but if Will died right now I wouldn't care at all
Huge compassion to u Mr. Smith u are a good person but u ve been manipulated by a very evil woman.  I wish u open your eyes soon.
When you're wrong, you have to own it immediately. He waited until he realized Hollywood wont cast him anymore to apologize. That is not genuine. You're sorry you lost work. That's about all you're really sorry about...
Im not sure about his relationship with Chris and Tony, but as far as I know this is Wills only "bad" public moment. He and his career is redeemable, at least career wise, IMO.
Everyone makes mistakes u good brodie
It's just a commercial for Jaden's Just Water brand...  hahahahaha!!
❤❤❤❤
Will please just make up for this to all your fans like me who looked up to you. I know you signed a movie deal just make it the best movie of this year because so far the movies have been garbage this year. That’s all we as fans ask for.😂
He’s gone from being someone you could laugh along with to having to be wary of his unpredictable behaviour. I don’t think he’s a bad guy. But it was a pure red mist moment that he’ll just have to live with the effects of long term
Being ashamed of yourself is appropriate. You can learn from that and grow into a better you. Next time you’re about to lose control of your behavior, that shame should bring you back from the edge.
Very good… very proud of you
Chris isnt obligated to ever speak to Will again tbh. Shoutout to Will though for reaching out I guess
God bless you, Will. Everything will be fine. People will forgive you and move on! Chis will forgive you too just give him time.
Atleast on the plus we got some pretty dank memes
Will, you are only human. You made a mistake and owned up to it. I appreciate you being the type of role model that not only shows how to be hardworking, disciplined, and a loving person but also how to be a good human and get back up. It's easy to be a decent human in the good times but the tough times show true character. Stay strong and know you are showing many what it really means to "man up" or "human up." May only greatness be before! You got this. This to shall pass.
I like Will Smith movies, if he gets the chance to make more, I'll watch em.
He lost me at the end when he's talking about light, love, and joy.    All i'm hearing are rehearsed lines and self-deception by a guy with lots of issues.    Just keep it real.   Go sit down and do a long-form podcast with Chris.   Iron out what happened man to man.     Let people see that and then you're forgiven.    Drop the whole narcissistic messiah act too.
I was hoping one of the questions would be, why he laughed at first.
Will PLEASE FORGIVE YOURSELF. You’re HUMAN! Guess what you’ll make more mistakes as do we all. The fact you’re trying to grow past this speaks volumes that you can apologize. Please don’t allow imperfect people trying to project their trauma and need to judge you keep you in bondage. Love you.
You’re a good person. You’ve done more positive in this world than 99.9999% of the other 7 billion people with whom you share Oxygen. One mistake does not define who you are and what you represent. Continue to use your power for good, dear sir. Time heels all wounds. Much love ❤
I never ever stoo being your friend
Yeah... No amount of pre rehearsed apology videos are going to make people forget... Or resurrect your career.
do watch coda and Belfast because of this they didn't get the recognition they deserve, congrats to the both movie team.
Just saying sorry doesn't fix or solve what happened and how it affected people. And took a while for this to even happen
❤️❤️❤️❤️
We are lucky that this Russian guy can read people..here is what he said about Will: https://youtu.be/ik0xUKFkInM
If I were Chris I dont think I'd speak to him again. Understand and forgive, but what Will did was probably one of the most disrespectful, humiliating things possible. I dont see a relationship there to salvage thats worth further interaction.
He is full of excuses and takes a complete lack of responsibility.
Let it go…..still love you will!!!
Andrew Tate to Will - Well, you defended your woman!!!! you did nothing wrong!!!! i would have thrown an axe if i was in your position.
I like how will kept the comments open cause he could’ve easily disabled them. Hopefully him and Chris can talk it out like men.
In the past hour alone I did some embarrassing things. They just weren't on a worldwide stage. We ALL have ions of stuff we're ashamed of. A true measure of a man is HUMILITY.
"Remorse without feeling ashamed ..." that statement is so sincere, human and eloquent.  Thank you Will.  I remain your fan!
Love you bro
I believe in Will……I think a spiritual journey to India or Africa or somewhere and trying to undo the Dianetics of it all would go a long way in his mental health Z
You are human, choices were made and you owned up to them. We love you still, in your best light and darkest moments. ❤
I was disappointed at first, but I was over it after a week or so, I believe Will is a good guy and he'll come out of this a better man, plus I love his work in general and hoping to see more of his acting talent for many years to come
Will wants to get his career back on track
Thanks, Will. You're doing great. You're an amazing person and you've shown incredible maturity. We've all had horrible moments of behavior, many moments. They just weren't played on live TV. As far as this fan is concerned, it's over, and let's get back to all the positive things. I hope Chris, when he's ready, will talk with you, but if not, you've done the work. Peace to you, and can't wait to see what you do next in the world!
Not the smartest thing to have done, but everyone makes mistakes and you've apologised. Move on bro, we all have.
You didn’t owe us an explanation but thank you. I hope you both heal and that you don’t beat yourself up too much. Like you said, we are all human and thank God some of us will never know the stress of living under the scrutiny of the public eye. I pray you both come out of this in a better space than that day🙏🏾💯 The person you were before that day worked too hard to let anyone else define what your legacy will be to the world. It was a moment but you have more greatness to step into and know you have support still💪🏾👑💜
All well and good, but wouldn't the rest of us peasants still be in jail?
❤️
This is most boring apology ever.
You made an absolute fool of yourself in the most disrespectful matter and there's no coming back from it. Apologize all you want. Chris should never accept it
But if he was yt y'all would crucify him lmao
You shouldn't apologize.  You were always this person.  You made the money pretending to be a vanilla funny house black.   Days of making money off that image are done.  Just switch it up bro.  Surprised your people haven't already told you this.
Shared your video on my Facebook page peace
Your reading!  my nigga this was all staged too I don’t believe none of you actors period Pooh
Apologies are usually for the person apologizing, not for the person that wqs agreieved.   This is all BS, Will must need publicity. Not enough time has passed. Instead of leaving it along, he is trying too hard.  I was a Will Smith fan...but no more
We forgive you
I grew up with Will as one of my heroes. I watched all his movies and bought his music as a kid (I still have the CD's now in fact) It was truly upsetting and shameful to see the way he reacted that night and I had completely lost faith in him to the point where I would refuse to watch any of his new stuff, also comedy's reputation has been tarnished. I do however believe in forgiving people when they realise their mistakes, but I think he has a long way to go yet. He still refutes to what Chris said as disrespectful, it was comedy and was never meant to be disrespectful and that's the point that a lot of people including Will seem to miss.
good try to stay relevant
yo siempre sere fan tuyo will,  de los errores se aprende, todo bien
This is all I needed, I forgive you will! ❤️
Now this is how you appoligize (manny others can learn from this), up ot chris to reach out when/if he wants.  We all make errors.
well said, better than what most people would say in the same situation. respect
Whenever I hear someone say "I'm human" in addressing something egregious they did, it tells me they're not truly repentant. Apologies should never be laced with excuses. "I'm human" is an excuse. Will, I want to root for you, but honestly, I think you're so much of an actor and an image-projector that I don't know that you're even able to be truly vulnerable and sincere at this point. The tone of your voice, the choice words and your articulation all suggest you're not there yet - you're not where you need to be in terms of contrition. So, forgive me if I see this as posturing, but my good brother, this is not it. May you be freed from the entrapment of wealth and privilege so you can truly rediscover your humanity. You're still my brother, I will not give up on you.
Good on him for taking the time to actually apologize. I know the incident was in the heat of the moment and we all have done things blindly in that moment. Was it unacceptable, for sure but I can't cast the first stone when I've reacted that way myself. I'm glad though that right after it happened he went to India to self reflect and work on himself. That's a good first step.   I'm still a fan because we all are human and humans make mistakes. Main thing is to learn from past mistakes and make sure it doesn't happen again. I actually think he's learned a valuable lesson here. If it was a pattern then it would be a problem. Never seen him his whole career react this way and I believe it's a one off.. I hope Chris reaches out to him and they hash it out face to face..
Call chris and call him sugar daddy that will be fair.
Sending my love ❤️ to u both hoping you both are able to come together much love will 😘
Still a hero of mine
Show the dude some grace. "Let he that is without sin..."
Thanks for the humanity in this.  So much of this resonates with me.  And I'm sure the same can be said for many others.  I hope you find peace and grace for yourself, and that others will give you grace in light of your vulnerability and candor.
Man it’s human nature to have feelings what’s done is done no need to keep reiterating your mistakes forgiveness is a process that heals on it’s own & for further more it’s not your job to bring joy to the world  .. you ain’t Santa Clause your Will Fuckin Smith.
Okay but when are you gonna apologize for YouTube Rewind?
FO
👊
Started and ended my poop with this video. Thanks will. Perfect timing
WILL VC É FODA DEMAIS, O CHRIS É CHATO PRA PORRA, A GALERA EXAGEROU DEMAIS, VOLTE
Glad to have you back, bro.
Still love you will, your one of my favorite actors
I was never canceling you period! You are a true legend & I hope you & Chris can makeup & be cordial
Will, you are awesome.  We all make mistakes.  Move on Will.  Your apologies says a lot about you.  You just gave a great example to our generation and next.  God blessed you always my friend.  You are Jehovahs child.He got you man! PEACE
Everything sounds so scripted...
Everybody makes mistakes, we are all human in the end. I never lost my respect for you bc u owned up to it. that shows self reflection and growth. Thank you very much for this video. Take care and wish you well still on your future endeavors. Ill be following ur works like i always have.
Adults are children that have lived longer! God put you on this world and you are not meant to make all the right choices! It is very brave to apologize and it is even more brave to accept the fault you have made!
I can’t help but empathize with him. He’s a human being who messed up. I believe in redemption, and he can redeem himself in time.
You’re human not just a soul but still very much in the physical body. Remorse is a great start. Thank you for your vulnerability. It was felt.
Not related....but I loved your book! I got the audible version & felt like you were sitting there talking to me! I really enjoyed it!
What an insincere way to explain yourself.....months later, with a full camera crew, and bunch of "non-answers".
Leave that woman...
You can take the man out of Philly, but you can't take the Philly out of the man.
So proud of Will Smith for accepting what he did was wrong and that he is trying to be a better person.  I've always liked him and always will but he is human like us all and he deserves a 2nd chance from us all.
Fake
❤️❤️❤️
It takes a lot to apologize, happy that you are able to come forth and do so. Wish you best of luck Will ✌️
You’ve accepted responsibility. You’ve apologised. You’re aware of where you did wrong.  We are not defined by our actions.   Let’s keep it moving…!
LOOK BRO ITS OVER CHRIS IS OVER IT HE LIVING HIS LIFE AND HANDLING HIS CAREER STOP WITH ALL THE BULL APOLOGIZES BRO U SOUND REAL PITIFUL
Thank You Will..❤️
I am proud of you for taking time out first and foremost for yourself. I am also glad that you have accepted responsibility for what you did, and have apologized. Hopefully we can all move on now from this. We need to see you in movies, creating content that you love to do!!! I pray that you continue to heal, learn and grow!!!  we miss you 😉
Well done Will, at the end of the day you’re a human being, you did something on the spur of the moment for what felt like the right reasons at the time, you shouldn’t be hung, drawn and quartered for it.  Stay strong brother 💪🏻💪🏻
Good job PR department.
I'm sorry Chris, now about the rest of the planet....
Somos seres humanos con aciertos y desaciertos, nadie tiene porque crucificarte, son errores se aprende, Will muy bien por ti por hacerlo y pedir disculpas, liberate sana y se feliz, solo tenemos una vida y enfrentarla con lo que venga. Con la  Frente en alto y mirada al cielo  te queremos. 🥰
Fake apology
Still love you Will Smith can't wait for your projects to be completed you will get through this in time. As a fan ty for your sincere apologies you will come back stronger than ever from this awful event.  God Bless you and your family see you on the big screen and TV soon
PHONY
I won't turn my back on you because of one mistake. We all make mistakes...🙂
No human is perfect
A great man, with a toxic, narcissistic woman in his life. You have nothing to prove, love is not about proving on acts you love someone, nothing justifies anothers action if it HURTS YOU.  You will never be alone, you have us. Once a relationship and trust is broken, it will NEVER be the same. You deserve better, you deserve everything. We are here for you.
Yikes he back
Why you apologizing to your kids? They celebrated what you did.
One of the best emoters the world has ever seen.
Will, I will never judge you on a single act of your life even if it is a mistake, because you have done so many things well that a single stupidity cannot destroy everything so, I love you will. Forever and ever. ❤❤❤
I'm glad Will did this, but I also hope he's sorted out the root cause of his problems. If not then we haven't seen anything yet. 😑
most of us understand that "poop" happens from time to time. most of us hope you all become friends again much love from Alaska
WE LOVE YOU WILL, WE UNDERSTAND IT WAS A LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT …
It takes a big man to apologise. He fucked up. Said he was sorry, and he probably will still do so for a while. Lets hope hes able to bounce back hes only got himself to battle at this point. Come back strong and make a killer film. We all want to see that. Who hasnt made a stupid mistake in there life. Hes only human.
Well said Will you can tell he was under stress from the weight loss yet you're love out here fam!
We all miss the mark at times, learning and growing from it is what we all have to make changes and become who we want to be.
You are playing the victim.  What are you going to do in your community to hep others not behave like you?  Let's see you walk the talk
when does he start talking about the political and economic state of the world?
Takes a lot of courage to do this.
Strong and fair man.
What really hurts someone is when you didn't apologize or did something for your mistake.
I am still a fan.. we all have moments in life that we are not proud of but I fully appreciate you being accountable and honest❤️
He still the most loved in my house, we love you Will 💕
He can only try to apologize and do better. He has been a role model for a long time and this shows how human we are. Takes 30 seconds to make a mistake that takes a lot away. Is a hard road back. He has the opportunity to show that we can make mistakes but the important thing is how we handle it.
I love Will Smith I grew up watching him and being a fan but I feel like this apology came kinda late its been months since that happened
So much respect Uncle Will!! 🙌🏾
So it took him all this time to do a public apology? More like the work dried up and he's PR team stepped in.
This is entire bullshit. There's no part of you that thinks that's the right way to behave? Were you playing a character? Clearly some part of you, whatever part you accessed that night thought that was the optimal solution. You had the time, walking on stage to pull it all back. But you did what you did.  Turning around now and saying the opposite. I'll believe your actions over your words.  Go away.
That's a nice piece of Restoration Hardware furniture...what was he talking about again? The weight loss is looking good given the trajectory he was on before all this.
It took 4 months for him to just post THIS!  And YOU THINK that this should mean something to me and my family?
I love you,still
It's not irreparable... This is what we do as family WE FIGHT AND WE GROW...
Meh, this is ur first mistake ever Will, Don't even trip, it's all g. You don't deserve the backlash of this. You're the boy scout of Hollywood, then u mess up once and it's like ur the worst person ever? That is bs. The world needs to cut u some slack.
He is reading these questions like he doesn’t know what’s coming
He really made an apology video and had his water bottle of his company on the table. This was all just a gimmick to promote his water.
Respect!
Talk smack get smacked
Your sincerity and vulnerability is a teaching moment. Thank you for this visual.
Does Will actually understand that "I want to apologise" is not the same as an apology?
Well done Will, I would recommend you do a lot of analysis on why you did what you did. I believe the root cause was not a perceived insult at that moment but the fact your own personal sense of worth was being insulted, and not by Chris, and not just in one instance. Good luck. Your ARE one of the good guys, and you are a role model. Show your kids (and others) what a healthy relationship looks like. That doesn’t necessarily mean unconventional, but it does mean honest and MUTUALLY respectful. All the best.
Just doing this for the views…
Doesn’t really matter what he says, he acted way out of line and shouldn’t be allowed back. Honestly he should’ve been charged. I love your work man but some things shouldn’t be looked over with an apology.
I can't unlove Will.
We are all human.  There is moments in our lives that we all react like Will did, but it is a test of the heart whether we will apologise or not so we can continue our journey to the destiny set out for us.  Life is so tricky.  Well done Will😊👍
Hmmmmmm…..
❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I may have missed it, but I would love to see an apology from Chris (preferably a funny one) where he admits that it's not cool to make light of a terrible disease.
Everyone makes mistakes you are loved
Took long enough
Of course there is a sigh in the beginning 😂😂
The right step, man. ♡
We are all humans. Humbleness and forgiveness is something we have to practice more. He made a mistake but we all do, the key is not to stay stuck in the idea that a mistake defines our life. Only death is the ultimate Judge.  You still have time to present the best version of yourself.  This goes to anyone reading this.
Actions speak louder than words. Put in some charity work
Will... what legal team showed u these questions pls show the real questions that weve all been asking for years
"Disappointing people is my central trauma" LMFAO
I just want to give him a hug being with a person doesn't love you can really break you along with your other trauma..
Took you three months and a production team to apologize?
I'm friends...
Love Will. Much respect for apologizing! ❤
Will Smith you still the best we have. Thank you for you
A brick at a time...
We are the sum of our choices.  This apology was a good choice.
That's good smith nothing is better than recognize when we are wrong hope you got forgiveness cuz you deserve it and you'd tried to protect your ungrateful women...
ain't no way man💀
This will be number 1 trending by end of day
I like this in the Will in every moment he ask pardon there's one thing that even I don't think he should apologize for, it's really very beautiful in his nature
This is a big step and a great move,  I appreciate this and the healing it will bring
It takes a real man, a real KING, to be a stand-up guy and to apologize for his temperament. This is called being mature, owning what you have to maim when you let other individuals and your colleagues down. I applaud you, King Will Smith, and I think the entire universe can learn from this apology. Things happen. At times we say or make the wrong choices in life, but owning it and admitting guilt and apologizing for our wrong blunders, let me know he is very apologetic and embarrassed for his actions. We forgive you and we love you King-Smith. You made a repairable decision and you are on the right path to mending this predicament. May God Bless both of you Kings and your family.🙏🛐🙏
U STILL THE MAN!!!!😎😎😎😎
Sos humano Will, nadie puede decirte qué hacer.
This was a weak apology, should of stuck to the script. Cause it went from I'm sorry to all about Will real quick. Not to mention the Merch and product placement with the water.
I love you and you are human. We all do things that will be judged.  You were not right or wrong you made a decision to act based on your emotions that others can arrogantly judge as wrong although nobody knows what they would have did. Your experience is just that...your experience.
To all the haters, Will has spent his entire career showing us in his performances that with compassion we can rise from our failures, his weak moment has past, let him move on, we can learn alot from this man about love, all he has ever done is give.   Stay strong Will, move on from this and be happy, we are all in your corner 💪😁
Proud of him...yeah....hmm. Get a million views out of it too. Interesting what the definition of a channel means.
Fogged out my booty… it was very clear and intentional. Lots of pride for no reason.  I never saw a career so big end in a single second of a move!  IMO there is nothing for Chris to reach out to Will about.  Just move on…
you had multiple opportunities to apologize - you ignored them - you have simply perpetuated every negative stereotype about a man of color
Still with you Will!   My are an inspiration in many ways!  WE are all human cut from the same cloth of emotions and emotions control every single one of us.
You act was more than unacceptable…a lot more!
Everything happened for a reason you can never change the past you can only learn from it and do better and what happened is to make them both better people if they’re willing to accept it and grow from that to humble themselves
I love you 💕💕💕
LSmith. Lost alll respect
Only thing I'm not buying is the Jada's answer and I think almost everyone will agree with that.
Sorry but too little, too late, this should of been said weeks ago, better yet on the night it happened, you let everyone down Will, your family, your fans, your peers, and most of all yourself, all the comments on here saying "We forgive you", it's BS, they have nothing to forgive you for, it's down to Chris to make that call........like all things with you Will it's about ego.......everything you've ever done, everything you do, and I imagine everything you ever will do will be about your ego, as far as I'm concerned your a spent force, and I hope the industry see's it that way to.
AWE WILL JUST KNOW THAT IN THIS LIFE SOMETIMES OUR EMOTIONS TAKE OVER...YOU ARE ONLY HUMAN AND YOUR FANS UNDERSTAND THIS....GOD LOVES YOU WILL AND SO DO I.......HUGGGGGS
J give Chris a fair one behind the scenes
Que alegría verte, eres una gran persona, hacia delante  atrás ni para coger impulso, fuerza Will esperando verte en próximos trabajos ❤️❤️🫶🏻🫶🏻
Bruh could’ve just called Chris…we don’t care anymore 🤷🏽‍♂️
Omg who tf is his PR team? Y’all should have pulled a Kris Jenner and said NOTHING until this all fizzled out.
He only doing this cos he probably got a movie coming up he needs to promote.  Don't mistake real life with what these celebs live.   Thoughy it was quite hokey.
Praying for you to move past this moment and reconcile with all who you need to... I know your human which means you make mistakes i hope you can forgive yourself. God already has if you asked Him to. I pray this moment will not define you and you continue to do what you've done all these years and thats bring smiles to our faces.
We all mess up will, I respect that you did  this and that you're trying to do better and be better. May God bless you🙏🏽💯
So, you wait until the big storm has passed thinking that people will be more sympathetic. Not buying it. You normalized this type of behavior that night and set the worst example for the newer generations. FAIL! This is cowardice.
Masaan idgaf what anyone had to say about will he’s human he aint perfect and thats that he still my goat no matter what
I really didn't think it was this deep. Didn't even seem real at first
I think you said it all when you said we are human. We all make mistakes. Sadly, this hurt more than the relationship between you and Chris but I am confident that you will learn and overcome this and do everything you can to make it right. I am proud of you today.
I believe that in that moment Will was sorry for what he was getting ready to do. I love both Will and Chris; I hope they can rebuild their friendship. I truly believe he's remorseful  and I pray they can both heal.
Will Smith
I was sooo disappointed in what you did, literally I was disgusted. However I believe you/believe this apology, because I believe in what we knew of Will Smith before to be the person you are.  Everyone make mistakes, it was a huge one.. boarder line having a breakdown kind of moment. However I do believe Chris should forgive you and that you should be allowed to move on from this now.  I was one of the ones who was amongst the question of feeling let down. Obviously not me personally, but for the fact that you were such a strong positive role model in Hollywood. Just an inspirational A list celebrity, the fact you are a BM.. was so good for our community put the cherry on top.   We have such a lack of good role models; that come across as good people, good fathers, good husbands, charitable, support bw, promote good values and morals.. so we need figures like you to stand strong in the community.
Love you Will..Always have, always will...We are humans,we make mistakes...
Lol
Those were great questions. Absolutely great questions that encompassed a lot of the general public’s ideas, thoughts, and curiosities.
There is the public side and private side of every famous person. Unfortunately we got to see the private side of Will Smith. That anger did not come out of no where. It would seem that Will let everyone see the side of his personality that has anger issues. He obviously has personal issues he needs to deal with. Good one him for trying to apologize but he should have said he knows he has anger issues as well.
This is really one of those situations to me like “let he who is without sin throw the first stone.“ You are right you made a mistake and you are also right but if you are a human being that makes mistakes. It sounds like you’re doing the work to understand what caused that but regardless that’s not my business. I just want to say thanks for making the effort and for communicating. I for one am still grateful for all the amazing movies that you made. Many that have gotten me through years of medical challenges laying in hospital beds and at home. If there is a score keeper on Joy you have brought into the world you are still one of the best players of all time!
we love you and we are proud of you for addressing your mistakes. be safe, will. thank you.
I think someone is pointing a gun at him
This is for him not Chris..Chris said he isn't ready to talk . So let's call out the world.
Hi Will, I think you’re still great in your gift and as a person whom God the Almighty created. I forgive you❣️ If God forgives us for ALL our sins who are we NOT to forgive someone? We ALL made mistakes no matter the magnitude so let’s not act like our grass is greener on the other side‼️Much love and Blessings your way❣️💕💕💕🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽😇😇😇😇
We love you Will, we’re all human beings and make mistakes
😊👍 we got you...
This ain't no more than illuminati public humiliation.
if it take you 3 months to apologize it's not genuine
Will ur a goat
Good to see that Will Smith reflected on his behavior and chose to publicly apologize! Thank you, I'd like to be friends again 🤗
A bit late for apologize
Sounds just a robot talking, feels like damage control to try and get work again.
I forgive you Will. No one in this world is perfect but our Heavenly Father in Heaven. We all fall short. We learn from our mistakes. And keep trucking forward. I’m proud of you for doing just that.  Can I borrow $5?
you had a moment like most of us. you are human. I still love you I think of you no less of a man. proud of you explaining yourself.  my pray is you continue to walk with your head up, thank God to keep his hand upon you and every one that this affected. love you man.
At least he is owning up to it.
Love You Will ❤
If Will would’ve apologized immediately after, we would’ve called it a “reaction”, not an apology… This was perfect timing - I call this Will’s well thought out “act of intention, remorse, and true repentance”!
Please retired from acting.
Hurt people, hurt people. You are still one of my favorite actors. Everyone has a moment of weakness. We've all messed up. We have all let our anger out in unhealthy ways. No one is perfect. I promise you, it is repairable! Time heals all wounds. It will take time, but it will happen ❤️
The way you act under pressure is the main metric for judging your character, and you Sir, fucked up. I am sorry. You are apologizing is because you are forced to do it. If it took this long for you to come out of the fog, your fog is where your residence is. A lost respect is not regained by an apology video. You need to do A LOT more.
Well at least he is trying!!! It was still some bullshit. But at least he is trying to make amends.
Prayers & Blessings to both you and Chris. You’re a great multi-generational example of good. That moment wasn’t you but nobody is perfect.  🤞just takes time some time.  (At least you didn’t go closed fist Ali. That would have been real bad)
Great to see you back! Still riding with you
Yo Will it has !! been minute And im glad you talk here first My Mom Took DNA test come find out im related King Richard lll So now i know why im crazy and have a unquenchable thirst for money power fame And i might be all might powerful famous rich But Will i cant leave Philadelphia if i do i melt away and get tickets just way i talk God Blessed You Just like Hook Remember Will Remember who you are and when i hear you cussing  Its like the greatest thing i ever can dream about hearing So for that im sorry Im sorry so sorry you be stressing Cheer Up think about Philly Remember when when won Super Bowl Championship  I was in prison Will
You have been the epitome of excellence for over 30 years. Your 1 mistake does not negate the goodness and joy you have brought to the world through your art and philanthropy. I’m happy to see you back. I also want you to forgive yourself. Many Blessings
Hug to you ~~~
That’s cool, bro, but who asked?
It's none of my business really, but I think it sets a good example for how to apologize.
Babe?? How u still call babe to someone didn't want to merry u??
❤️❤️❤️
He talks like he has a gun pointed at him 💀
We just want you to be happy. . .
As Chris’s cousins grandson I accept your apology
CAREER OVER !!! LOL
🙏 🙏 Move forward with greatness.  We all fall short. Love yourself.
If you were not a celebrity, no one would blink an eye. Instead, they would say you were sticking up for your woman.
What really matters is that God forgives us and he asks us to forgive each other. Love is the answer.
WE LOVE YOU, WILL SMITH ❤❤❤
the bots are alive and well, wonder how much will spend on them… get outta here man, seriously just was a peek into what the real smith is like. absolutely shameful behavior. real people don’t buy this. dudes actin.
Why am I crying 😭 we love you Will and always support you and proud of you for taking the time you need to reflect and lastly for apologizing ❤️
It’s okay Will, you’ve been through a lot and it takes a real man to apologize and own up to their mistakes in front of the world. The naysayers will say it’s scripted. But the very fact, that you’re lost for words shows how much sorrow you have for that lapse of judgment.
Will it’s okay man. We’re all human. Much love to you and yours.
we love you 🥰🥰🥰
I cannot believe he’s still defending this woman who has embarrassed him so many times.
We love you Will
Atleast he’s taking accountability in his actions. How often do we see in a world where so many never apologize and own up to their mistakes and channel it into something more positive. Why be upset that he’s only doing what he can and mend fractures in personal relationships he tarnished?
Really Will...?!?! It took you this long to do this ???
Chris isn’t ready to talk. So why are you going public with an apology that he won’t hear? Ya know, he’s doesn’t want to hear it.   So apologizing publicly “to Chris” — what is that about, other than ego and saving face for yourself?
Can't wait for the body language folks to dissect this.  You've clearly been coached on it and have seen all the other videos.   You have shown you don't deserve multi-million paychecks despite how much effort you put into acting out apology videos.  There are consequences for abusive behavior.  You need to deal with them and go away.
thats how you apologize 10/10... dont try to put "light" and good things into the world and dont make promises like that i think. you need to put good things into yourself first and then if your inner glass of goodness is full, let it overflow and pour out to your fans
Will is a Republican 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️😂😂😂😂
Sorry, not enough. Never will be.
Chris please never give this coward the time of day.
This does NOTHING
Hi Will, I wrote a long comment & fell asleep posting something that probably didn't mk any sense. What I want to say is that yes, I was pretty shocked when I saw what happened...that's not the Will I'm used to seeing! BUT....we're all human! I've loved your work for so long & I'm thankful for you sharing your talent with us! I would never change my mind abt you because of 1 mistake! As for Chris....just give him some time and I thk he'll come around. Long story short...the people that truly appreciated & respected you before this happened won't let this change their minds abt you! I wish you the best & look forward to many more yrs of entertainment from you!
Looks like someone is having trouble not being relevant anymore.  It only took 4 months and he's going through sycophant withdrawals.
Trying to save your career only that is why you are apologizing. Your acting is superb with your fake sincerity.
Apology accepted.
Did you take the time to explain to your son that this is wrong.  His statement, " this is how we do it", right after.
4 months too late for the apology tour.
Chris is not ready to talk because his lawyers are preparing his civil suit
Todos cometem erros, é preciso grandeza pra reconhecer isso e se desculpar!! Class attitude
Sadhguru effect🙏
Worth the wait. I still have a lot of respect for Will. That one bad decision doesn’t and shouldn’t diminish all the good he’s brought to the world by sharing his talents with us. He’s human.
Celebrity life is tough and still love you and the fam. Sending you love and support. To Chris too! ❤️
Bad Boys for life! Always got you Will!
Outside of the folks you apologized to, DON'T worry about what people think. They haven't met you, they don't know you. Even if they look up to you, so what. They are not your burden. Stay prayed up and move on. 👏🏾🙏🏾
Much love for you Will ... We ALL have moments. I am sorry yours was so public. Be proud of yourself for your growth and self reflection.
The fact that he has to publicly make an apology breaks me. Being a celebrity is such a heavy load.
I love you man ❤️
Thoughts and love are with you. Thank you for posting this. <3
he only doing this because he received a lot of hate and backlash...Will is a punk!
I've messed up far worse than you did, always because of alchohol. The shame is hell. I've since learned to drink more responsibly. I still think you're an awesome guy and love all your movies.
you did nothing wrong brother.
I found myself in disbelief and thinking did that really happen? I was more worried about what would happen next and whether the brand I know as Will Smith would disappear I can’t wait until your next movie.
You owe your wife's boyfriend an apology too
Nobody is perfect. We are all humans after all. You did the right thing and came forward talking about it. You can't change what happend but you can stand up for it.
Bravo Monsieur.
lol I’m so sick of this theatric. This a stage and we just the big mouth onlookers 😂😂😂
I hope Chris and Will get to talk. This is one of the sincerest apologies I have seen. Ultimately it is up to Chris to forgive and I see that happening in time.
You’re Human!  As a lifetime fan of you & Chris, I was shocked that night and mad at you for going berserk, so I'm absolutely thrilled to see your sincerity in this video.   Thanks for the apology to everyone & I pray you & Chris and his family can settle privately in person, then make your peace public as grown men should.  Life’s too short to not do so!  Stay well. Cheers!
Just shows ur a real human and not I robot yes its wasn't right but we as humans gotta do bad to learn or even good to learn that's how we as humans learn
Stood by you then and now. Thank you for being vulnerable to the world.  I hope that you get some comfort knowing that we see the courage it takes to do this.
We live in such a cruel world and everyone has an opinion but who is without sin, cast the first stone. We have all made mistakes and continue to make mistakes. What you do after your mistake is what matters.  Keep striving for better Will, you are not condemned.
I don’t remember asking.
He’s human. He made a mistake. A big one, but a mistake. This too shall pass.
Imo ur going down in history for all the wrong reasons now
Will stop you should of apologized that same day. Now you want to do it cause of all the backfire. Your not apologizing cause you want to. Your apologizing cause you have to.
Nope, not buying it. Fake schmooze
I sincerely believe that Will Smith, has had a very bad time, we are humans, and we all make mistakes, I hope this is the first step to a change for the better.
If I’m Chris, this isn’t enough. Too little too late
Emotions get the best of everyone at some point. Unfortunately it was in front of the world. Great video
This apology is sincere ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Let’s start easy. I’ve loved Will for years. Watched every film I think. He’s been an inspiration and is one, if not the best, actor in the world. However, this a very long overdue public apology for a public humiliation.  I’m glad it’s done, but it’s hard to get over. Not sure if he will ever address the question, but so many people just wonder why he did it?  I hope you sort it out between you and somehow turn this around.
Forgiveness will have to be earned with positive actions. Not willing to forgive yet. That doesn’t happen so quick.
Trying to get that career back?
Everybody makes mistakes Will, you live and you learn just stay strong and be you! You are a great human
Good for him
It’s ok babe you got this!!!!
If u want to sincerely apologize  Get a Divorce!
proud of you
Any other person would have been escorted out, instead of having a standing ovation later in the night.
"It's been a minute"??? He starts off an apology video with sarcasm -- I can't take this seriously.
Nice ad for your son's water company...
You are human with flaws and as a fan I love you still. You are still a good man!
you're human, you fucked up, its all good.
Shouldn't the description of this video be "I'm sorry everyone." not "Thanx y'all" ? :\
GET AWAY FROM SCIENTOLGY MAN.... FOLLOW THE REAL TRUTH
GOD shows us all grace and mercy everyday. You deserve grace. I am still hurt. It's like you were my big brother in my head for ages, but now I feel like we're just homies in my head. I pray you find peace in your life..in your heart.. I do want to say one last thing Will.. get closer to God..seek him whichever way that road leads for you, and I promise he will work it out for you! I still love you big homie..maybe, just maybe when I see you and Chris smiling again you can return to big brother status in my head, but not right now. Thanks for the apology I really hope you meant it..Love and good vibes fella..💕
He looks so young
👀
This is always a PR move and stunt. Absolutely pathetic 😂😂😂
Capping about Jeda man.
Your human, we all do things but I guess ours aren’t in front of the world 😬 don’t beat yourself up, peoples feelings grow back
still love you
I've always been in your corner everyone is human and no one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life smh. LOVE YOU WILL!
This guy is such a weirdo, hope this is the end of him
The only problem with this is its not sincere. Do better, don't make a fake production and throw it on YouTube. 🤡🤡
Love you Will!
you're only human. Emotions get the best of all us. Wishing you the absolute best Will.
It would have been necessary for him to explain why he did it, and what he actually learned from it about himself that will prevent such things from happening again.
This man ruined his career for a woman that doesn’t even love him
I respect you and I’m proud of you ✌️
Just retire dude, how hard is that. You are old enough to retire, many people do at your age.
I'd like to hear more how the incident ruined his acting career for the time being and what he thinks of that.......and I'd like to hear how he intends to control his anger in the future.  This apology seems unemotionally carefully directed and crafted by his PR agent.  And the title "it's been a minute"......huh?? It's been three months.
"I'm human" is shitty people's best excuse that they think alleviates them from responsibility and makes them look like the victim. Disgusting.  No Will. You're not "only human". You're a shitty human. Accept who you are. Stop using words in front of a camera to try to make things right. You're an actor. Why should we believe anything? Take some action instead. Do something crazy. Give Chris 20 million dollars. Or donate that to an anger management clinic. Or support an orphanage. Whatever. Be creative. Do SOMETHING.  Point is: SPEAK and ACT less. DO more.   Otherwise, your entire clip is just PR and brand damage control.
This is all it's about...taking accountability when we don't show up being our best selves and owning our wrongs and apologizing when possible.  Good job Will....I'm back in your corner!
♥️♥️♥️
Love Will and he's a great man. I feel bad for him the amount of stress this has put on him and his family. He's even speaking so shakily it's awful to hear. It's clearly tormented him all this time. What he did was wrong but Will isn't an immoral man at all. Hope him and Chris can heal and grow from this.
Love you Will ❤️ Glad your back!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
i hate that light behind his white hat.
Proud of him!!!
🤪Uuu Can Change Ur CORE Now BroHem 🧐Thou Art What Thou Art... and What Thou Art is a Full Blown Narcissist...What This is is a Narcissist Trying 2 Regain Control of His Most Precious Image by Passive Aggressive Force 🎯🤷🏽‍♂️💯
Apology, great. But why the full production crew with multiple camera angles, a dramatic blurred walk in, and slow dramatic panning shots?
Good to see you will !
Explain your history with Chris??
Heartfelt Apologies with a touch of sincerity.
This lunatic.
Will I love you no matter what…because you are human! 🤍
2:50 he forgets he suppose to be sad and stars laughing wow horrible person
Will smith with the Logan Paul apology
Everyone is allowed to make mistakes, especially when dealing with such powerful emotions. This was in my opinion an act of passion, not that his actions were justified. It takes a big person to issue such a heart-felt apology. You can really hear how hard and emotional it is in his voice.
Litterly only making the statement becuase the backlash & now trying to get the public back on side.
2:53 exactly shows how deeply he is affected by the incident 😏
MY QUESTION, WHY GIVE THAT ACCEPTANCE SPEECH ABOUT HELPING EACH OTHER .. RIGHT AFTER YOU DID WHAT YOU DID?.. SHOULD HAVE JUST THANKED EVERYONE AND SAT DOWN
Atleast it’s nothing like Travis Scott’s apology
I encourage Will Smith to read Sammy Davis Jnr autobiography YES I CAN. Now there was a man who had to endure many knocks, both physically and verbally. Yet Sammy handled himself with class, dignity and integrity. A diminutive man but oh my, WHAT A MAN.
We love you man
take courage Will, God loves you
Everybody makes mistakes, unfortunately for celebrities it’s all caught on camera. Nobody’s perfect at all, will you’re only human and owning your mistakes and apologising is the first big step in becoming the best version of yourself you can be. You’ve apologised and now all you can do is move forward don’t let it define you and continue to grow and be better because you’re an amazing person. It hurts to see you so torn up over it, I really hope you manage to put this behind you and find peace with it. We still love you Will!!❤️❤️
👏🏿✊🏿🤲🏿🤙🏿
And this is how you make an apology video.
❤️
Coward.  You should’ve been arrested.
We Love You Will we all make mistakes. Salute 🫡
am i the only one that scrolls down to find funny comments ?
Will you have apologized more than literal war criminals have had to. The fact that this entire thing dragged out as long as it has is insane. You made a mistake, you lost it and you regret it. Everyone else who's made it about themselves are insane and you owe them nothing. The actual effected party will talk to you when the time is right. You are still a great person, period.
You shouldn't feel bad bit I respect the old school way is protect your family at all costs but there has to be a better way but we are human
A good question would have been why did you laugh?
We are human with human failings. Prayers  for your healing with Chris and everyone else involved.
I think Will could use some nights out at some local parks playing basketball or softball with people he doesn't know.
We all make mistakes but it is important to acknowledge these mistakes which you certainly did.  Every human deserves a second or thid chance as long they understand what they did wrong.
Astroworld
It's okay Will. The fact that you can reflect on your actions, own up to them, have remorse and learn from your wrongs and try to be a better person, says a lot about your character because not everyone is able to do that. They let their ego get in the way. It takes strength, humility and courage and the hope to be a better person to do that. With Regards to Chris, you did your part and now the "ball is in his court." Let's hope that he finds it in himself to forgive and heal.
You also embarrassed Chris and likely triggered his own trauma from his past. You need to do all you can to address the harm you caused him. You can start by acknowledging the fact he was a boss in the way he handled the situation and that he prevented it from escalating to much worse incident as horrible as it was. It is very important that you do this.
That took genuine repentance and courage to do. Proud of you, bro. Everyone messes up. Now the weight of forgiveness is on those you hurt. You’ve done your part, now move on the best you can and learn from this.
one of the best apologies i have ever listen
It's nice that he left the comments section open.
I’ve been checking your YT frequently and I must say I’m relieved to see you back here again. It takes a real man to sincerely apologize for his mistakes. We’re all human and have made plenty mistakes especially in the heat of the moment. I hope things can progress for you from here on.
Take notes Kim Burrell! THIS is a true apology. Thank you Will.
Nope.
Your words mean nothing.  We see through you.  Devote your life to fighting poverty, climate change, and persecution.  Your fans want ACTION.
Everyone makes mistakes no one is perfect and when something bad happens you got it on up to it that takes a lot of guts to do but to me this video seems well rehearsed and I don’t think in a small box I think outside of the box if you’re going to apologize to someone for your actions you don’t say I want to apologize to so-and-so or I want to apologize for what I did that right there is really self-explanatory because the words the stupid coming out of the mouth or apologizing to someone else I’m sorry, i’m sorry for what I did I’m sorry for the ones that cause and just a simple I’m sorry OK notice to difference when someone says I want to apologize and saying I’m sorry.  I’m not perfect I want those metal stakes but I feel like fame has one up to his head 100% and to me I feel like he was full of himself which is ridiculous so that is my comment some of you may not like it but that’s OK but I’m just speaking facts
Toke him 4 months to prepare for this apology video great actor Booooh ban him from this page
Dont apologize for nun.. Just do what you do.. the world will say you wrong ether way
You said it man, be remorseful but remember that one action doesn't define you. You'll always be the man to me, mistakes happen.
According to ya'll, if Donald Trump apologizes for his mean tweets, ya'll vote him in 2024.  #hypocracy
That’s right. Save your career. Your wife’s been emasculating you for years. That’s the source of your frustration and anger my friend.
Now this is an "OFFICIAL " apology! I am glad they allowed us(the public) to see it also. Once a man apologizes,  and I mean Sincerely Apologizes like he did here, there is nothing else left to do but to forgive him! We all makes mistakes,  we are all human! This is humanity! It's bigger than any fame and ir fortune! I have much more respect for Will Smith than ever before! I am proud of him! He did not let his pride get in the way. Great job Will!!!
You Finished
👏🏼 One bad choice doesn't make a bad person! Will is a good man, we are allowed to own up to mistakes, apologise and move on 💕
Thank you Will. This is deeply moving. I think the best any of us can hope for is to learn and grow from our mistakes. Much Love! You continue to inspire, and I hope you continue to find your own self worth through this and come out a better man for it in the long run.
You’re entitled to make mistakes like everyone else. We love you and support not just your wins, but your lessons.
Beta Smith
Love you always. ❤️
Hey Will. Thank you for putting forth effort to correct your mistake. I have faith that with time we'll all have the closure we need.
I'm with you my man
I miss you
Seems legit
Thank you Will you are one of my favorite actors. I was thinking about you just yesterday and to see this morning means a lot. In a world  that is so messy right not when no one stands up and admit they were wrong. I know Chris will accept your apology. Yes I was disappointed, however I can feel your remorse  God Bless.
One strange issue still is seeing how his kids responded to what he did. They seemed to think it was a good way to respond looking at twitter.
Love ya Will
I love you Will. If someone insulted my family, I would react probably more than you did.
I have heard for years about what a terrible person you are in real life. I do see remorse in your eyes but is it only because of the backlash. Also, it doesn't help that your own child Jaden said, That's how we do it!" shows how the apple doesn't fall far from the tree !!! I won't support/watch either one of your movies again.
We’ve all been in this position. The position of acting out of impulse, the position of doing something that’s plain out disrespectful. We’ve all regretted things we’ve done and said and wished if there was a single second to buy back, we’d do anything to change it. But only few come back right after, point the finger at themselves and wholeheartedly take 100% accountability for their wrongdoings.  Yes what will did was nothing short of immoral and disrespectful, and just because it was originally meant to be an important day for him and also because he’s a celebrity. Does not give him the right to act the way he wishes. That being said. I respect Will for apologising, at the end of the day it’s better than nothing.
All that for a beach
You should both be ashamed of yourselves. Obviously it was staged.
I think anyone who is a person of good will can understand that sometimes we can act very far outside of our character. Very much appreciate hearing someone who I view as being a role model to the younger generation below us, show how someone stands in humility, admits wrong, and discusses how things can be made right.
WE LOVE YOU WILL ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Nice shirt, what brand is it?
We all make mistakes in life that we regret making, so did Will so……….let’s just move on. I still think Will is a living legend.
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself.... I'm human" felt that
I think we as "normal people", will never understand what is to be judge for every decision and mistake by the entire world, it must be so overwhelming being in the spotlight all the time. What you did was awful but its good that youre finally apologizing, its definitely a step in the right direction.
fart
🔥
I still don't see any sincerity. If this hadn't become a meme or there'd be so much talk about it, I don't think you'd even feel this way.  I might be wrong and if you're genuinely trying to do better, then more power to you, prior to that you definitely was my hero, in any case have a great day..
You're still My friend.
I hope that you have become a better human from this experience. And that right you made a mistake that’s A lot of people wouldn’t Apologized.
Thank you for being you.  I love how no matter what you keep it real.  We all make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow.  May blessings flourish for you.  You are an is inspiration. I've watch you from the beginning and still think your one of the best.
Too little...too late. IMO
Point is, you are only a human just like everyone else We do mistakes!
I love you Will! I believe every word you spoke. We all have to live and learn, even the GOAT! I am sure you have learned your lesson and will think before acting now on. Emotions are real and we all should know that by just dealing with our own lives. I have always admired you and nothing has changed. You are you! I feel that was a part of you that was buried and woke up from pressure.  Finding other outlets to release that pressure of being in the public eye can be a sense of peace... Disappointment is something we all have done to someone or ourselves, so people understand even the negative ones. Stay positive and keep showing growth. 💛
my father was very abusive growing up. so to see one of my favorite entertainers of all time act like someone who's abused me
I respect this.  I believe he's sincere in his apology.  It shouldn't have happened but We all have had our moments where we reacted impulsively without thinking about the consequences it later brings. He said his history with Chris impacted his decision so there's more to the story then we know.  I believe he'll bounce back from this tho
Not a fan.
Proud of you Bro that you did this ............you will be awesome again.
Will you look exhausted. Everybody makes mistakes, and the most important thing is to recognize and admit them. We are waiting for your comeback. Love you Will.
Wow. Deep. Glass this wasn’t on red table talk…
BTW your presence has been missed. It's a void in the movie world now waiting for you and only you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's kinda funny that he has his kids water brand next to him lol
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself.... I'm human" felt that
Get over it Will, nobody really cares that much. you helped Chris sell tickets.
Man, that was special to see him open up like that, we all make mistakes, time heals all wounds, God bless.
Mega rich celeb apologizes , wow much ok very cool
All things you have to say to avoid being canceled.
U can see a lot of us here 'hanging on'... no worries. Forgive yourself friend. Love n light x
The thing is he's a good actor, so we don't know if he's just acting or if he's really sincere.
I don't know if Will is going to see this or any of these other comments.  I've always looked up to him, even though he isn't that much older than I am.  Everyone makes mistakes, everyone makes a bad call.  Sometimes those mistakes have huge ramifications and sometimes they are barely noticed.  What's important is what we learn from them that makes us better people, better to ourselves and better to those around us. We're all human with all the flaws and strength that comes with.  I hope he is taking time to learn about himself and to learn what makes him happy in his own life and be willing to take steps to reach that happiness.
I hope things get better, Will! ❤
One bad moment doesn't make the man or we would all be screwed. You're still loved immensely and my personal favourite actor ❤
Um, why does he sound like a robot or like he's reading off of a teleprompter. This seems like gunpoint to me lol (I know it's probably not but it really seems like so forced that it gives off that vibe)
Love you Will Smith
Will Thank you for being human in the most sincere way. God bless us ALL.
Will when I saw your series on writing your book you talked about your obsession with validation about not letting people down and when I seen the incident & the aftermath… I was worried it was going to take you to a dark place. The thing about people on the internet is that they can throw stones because their business isn’t out there. Us regular people can make mistakes and not have it brought everyday with “think pieces” from people who don’t know our souls. Chris deserved this apology and you deserve to move on
Still one of my favorite entertainers of all time! Everyone makes mistakes You just happen to be in the spotlight and no one knows what You're going through if anything. Keep up the great work Bro always a fan.
You are awesome for doing what you just did you apologized in front of the whole world and that takes a lot of class and you are a great man I've never lost respect for you I understand how you felt and you have now apologized for your wrongdoing and you should be forgiven. Thanks for all you do
Love you my guy ❤️
We got you Will, you're human... I hope Chris is ready and you guys can talk soon. Love you both... Peace and Blessings
I just want to say I love you and I don’t think this one event should erase everything you have done.
All humans make mistakes but real men own up them, make amends and become better men.. Will is legendary.
Huge respect for this.
As a man nowadays, we can’t afford to be having these emotional outbursts in public, especially as a black man. It just makes you look weak. Remember, you’re Will freak Smith! You’re supposed to be THE Guy.
Still advertising the water 😂😂
He took to long to do this
Three months it took? The lawyers & damage control agents needed to work harder to persuade him sooner. He sure wasn’t going to deal with this on his own.
Always have been a great dude ! Much love! Everybody fucks up ‘  move on bruh🥂
4:05 tbh he didnt let his fans down, he let these kids and grown adults who dont leave the house and comment all day tell him he let THEM down.....IRL, we dont care. We just glad it was a smack and nothing further. Honestly, that shows another form of restraint and these media outlets purposely ignore that because they need traffic. We we seen wayyyyyyy worse on television 😒
Everybody makes mistakes you are not your past will only god can judge ....we love you and i promise you will be fine ❤️❤️❤️❤️love all the way from New Orleans ..
Tio
Will Smith is like a little girl🤦🏾‍♂️ a whole drama queen. Men don't speak like this.
Big props for apologizing. Takes a big man to admit faults.
God forgives and we should all follow the Lord’s example of forgiveness. I hope that others can forgive you because we ALL at some point in our lives will or will have to ask for forgiveness. My brother, remember that we all represent the Lord, at all times. Keep in prayer and continue to work towards overcoming the flesh each day.     I forgive you.
You have my support POR VIDA. Team Will Smith forever. I have never appreciated how CR talks about women.
Unfortunately that’s all he’ll be remembered for  Just lost all respect for him
I don’t know man. I had so much respect for you. I was so damn shocked at your behavior. I just don’t know if I can get that same degree of respect for you back.
Grew up loving the acting and personally of you Will, been a mega inspiration in my life. We a'll make mistakes. Pray Chris takes your words of apology and everyone that was hurt because of the incident and we all be good. Love man, take care.
I forgive you Will, still my all time favorite actor ❤️.  You made a mistake which only proves that you are an imperfect human being with emotions.....Now that you have sincerely apologized don't beat yourself up anymore. Move forward from that situation please no longer dwell on it.  I am still one of your biggest fans no matter what...#foreverfan
Alright I am legend 2
Only took you 4 months
Yooo that's hot, that's hot.  It's rewind time!
We're proud of your response Will. Thank you for sharing your authenticity and humbly apologizing in a manner that is equivalent to the public incident that happened. We wish you both well.
I support you man. It means a lot for you to address us and answer some of our questions. We’re all human and we all human. It takes real courage to own up to them and make a vow to do better. I believe you will. Keep lay those bricks down one after the other Will, you’ll be walking that road of redemption and along it valuable lessons will be learned.
Awww bless him , you can tell he’s ashamed and embarrassed but forgiveness is one thing that will probably help him move forward. Keep your head up Will 🧡
This is a good step in the right direction, Will. I think I can speak for a lot of people when I say that we’re proud of you for doing this. Remember, follow through is the biggest key. Your next steps after this will be to show the change that has occurred in you in a tangible way. Words are only words. It’s your actions that bring them life. But this isn’t something you can show the world. It must be when no one is looking, to show who you really are as a person.
Miss u Will!
I still think he had it coming :)
I like the hat honestly
I love Wil Smith💜He is human
Whatever you're human , Jesus says to forgive we all make mistakes . Feel grateful that you have been able to retreat and work on self . Don't live in the past it doesn't exist man only now in the moment is all that matters :) you're an excellent worker / entertainer we enjoy your movies . ✌️
Its rewind time !
Stil a fan here everyone makes mistakes and nobody knows the situation you’re in or the pressure you’re going through stay strong
It’s takes a lot for someone to admit when they were wrong. It says a lot about one’s integrity when they apologize. Proud of you. 🙏🏼
Takes true character to apologise, and even more character when one has such a high celebrity profile in the public eye… passion manifests itself in unexpected ways, as it did that night, but you’ve responded and managed it well 👏🏼👍🏼
About time 😂
I am so proud of you Will. You are human and we all make mistakes. Sometimes major mistakes but when we own up to those mistakes and ask for forgiveness, that means a lot. Let's forgive and move on. You are a good person, and I will always support you.
Good on you to apologize!
When a man tells you he isn't ready and will reach out when he is, you shut your mouth and go on living your life and give him space. If and when that happens is up to them. Sorry but this video was the opposite of that and I really hope Chris sees this for the attempt to gain attention that it is. Honestly that mans name should never leave your mouth again until he says it's allowed, much like you requested he keep your wife’s name out of his.
Not emotional at all. Scripted and a big nothing burger!
Its sad how people only ever remember the one Bad thing you do and completely forget all the Good you have done. How is it that we all allow for the Bad to overcome the Good even though the Bad is always the minority?  Keep fighting Will and I'm one fan that will always remember the Good put the Bad behind!
This was a heartfelt apology. You can feel his emotion and sincerity. I am rooting for you, Will! I hope Chris will open himself up to have that talk soon.
Bodoh ko, tapi begitilah kita manusia.. moga kita belajar dari momen ini 👌
Glad to see the man is back!
This is an amazing opportunity for Will to be real to us and more importantly to himself. This last few years he's looked so broken down and weak i can't imagine anyone including himself respects him. You can come back even stronger with a deep reflection into who you want to be and what brought you to your current position.
It's good enough that you know it was not right to attack someone like it and how jarring it was to see it coming from an idol like you. You have been a part of childhood of many, including me, and I hope that from now onward, you can be more mindful of your actions in public and just don't run to smack the sht out of everyone you disagree with.
YouTuber apology momment
We're hanging on. We're hanging on.
Even tho I thought you were 100% wrong in that situation thank you for doing it anyway. We got some good memes outta that
Saying sorry to keep himself in the news, publicity stunt
Boo
I don’t believe you
Will, I try my best to live by the scripture in the bible found in Galatians 6:1. You are HUMAN! You are a man and I respect you as such! YOU have made your apologies and I highly respect you for it. As much as people look up to you, you didn't have to make this public apology. You, like everyone else, deserve grace so I can freely give it to you! GIVE YOURSELF GRACE! FORGIVE YOURSELF and KEEP BEING GREAT! Love you!!!
😍😍😍😍❣👍🏽
Takes a big man to do this. Much love and respect
😁
A little unsolicited advice from a young nobody to an older somebody. Don’t let people get in your head. Fight for your family but remember who is watching. Keep your composure and fight with grace
👋
Side note: does Will Smith normally wear a wedding ring?
I only had one thought in the aftermath. You need to fully fund whatever Questlove’s next project is. Whatever that may be and whatever that may cost.
Sending so much love and light in your direction. I'm sure you have a lot already, but couldn't we all use a little bit more in these days and times?? You're a good man Will Smith.
Respect for you has been restored
Only if you buy me flowers
That's something... and this something is wayyyyy better than the nothing we had before. It took all I had to click on this, but glad I did as I now believe he deserves a second chance at some point.
I don't understand why people can't see that what said was out of line given the context. I see it no different then a bully at school mocking a kid with a disability... Just becuase you labeling yourself XYZ while doing the same actions doesn't void the exackly same intent.
Well said! Great to see him address it and that he is working on it. We are all human and we all make mistakes. I hope to see an amazing comeback from a very well respected person. ❤️❤️ always loved anything he’s been in!
Grown man ish! You're still good with me. Continue doing the work!
Shouldn't take this much production for an apology. This is just him and his team salvaging his image
Xo's This was the right thing to do and could not have been easy for you to do. Much respect always to you Will. Still a HUGE fan.
I'm glad he apologized finally man up for his mistake he did that night
good luck from Argentina!
Weak words to cover evil pride.now you have fallen.
Will will always be a hero in my eyes. His performances to his public actions. He did make a huge mistake at this award show and we all look at him differently, but the man has been going through a lot the past couple of years. I'm happy he took the time to apologize and answer questions. He is trying his best and as a fan in the audience I can't really hold him to a high expectation. Hes always seemed genuine and an amazing Uncle Phil. What he may do from here on out is another story but he will forever be a hero to me for being an example of an exceptional gentleman. I just hope he receives happiness and loyalty from here on out.
Proud of you for this. 💜
So does this mean we finally get that sequel to Hancock ?
Continue doing the work my brother  I get it
Nah I'm not feeling this...sorry
As a fan, I appreciate the message. I agree that the behaviour was inappropriate, and unacceptable. Further, I think it was abusive. I acknowledge the apologies, and appreciate that you did that.  However, we are more than our mistaken choices, and more than the worst thing we do. I think its great that you are identifying the issue as being the choice you made, and not you (in the sense of you being inherently wrong). I think some will make criticisms that an apology is not enough, or that the apology was scripted. However, I don't think you have signalled that you ought to receive anything in return for your apology, and I don't see an issue, personally, with having a scripted apology - if that is indeed the case. As long as the apology came honestly from a part of you.  I hope things are well with you going forward.
Will we still love u bro everybody knows how it feels to be overwhelmed & emotional even tho what you did was fucked up after I really thought about it 🤦🏽‍♀️😂 😂😂😂 but I don’t feel like u deserve to get canceled or nothing like that Chris will come around
I really hope Chris & Yourself can sit down and have a talk over this some day. Life's too short.  “Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to error that counts.” - Nikki Giovanni.
Will Smith the like button!
Will I'm still  down.  #1 Fan!  I  can understand  and empathize with everything you have said.  Continue to keep God first, your relationship with him first.  Praying for you.  I love your book.  Trying to pick my favorite movie and I can't pick just one!  Just remember to breathe, it's really ok to just let it breathe..🙏😊
This is perfect Will, you are growing and your mind too. You are going forward and repairing your mistakes. Love this message. Keep doing good work, is important.
We love you will!! Everyone makes mistakes and you are no exception. I can’t wait to see on the big screen again soon
Too little...TOO LATE!!! Good acting tho!   Look at all these ppl patting you on your back as though this is some great accomplishment! LOL who's patting Chris on his for being the only grown up in the room?  These commentors are no better than those fools who stood up and gave you a standing O after a truly pathetic action. I dont believe you are sorry and I dont care about what you think or how you feel because it is BS.
I miss when will smith did no wrong. Not because we excused it...but he literaly did no wrong. I just don't get it.
He got in one little fight and the world got scared. 🤣🤣🤣 smh the man is human, let him live!
Who held you hostage
Well, at least something. But even I am still processing it, so I'm not surprised Chris needs more time.
I like it, I like this, we're all humans, and Will deserves forgiveness for something he's recognized was wrong.
❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏
I give it to him for apologizing... but he coulda just said Sorry Chris I done fucked up and saved a few minutes.
absurd
Will sounds like you’re allowing space for this new you. You’re a good man - and this doesn’t mean much in the big picture the way you took responsibility for it. God bless you brother
👊🏽👏🏾
You made a mistake, welcome to humanity. Appreciate your pain, Im only one dude but I forgive you. Im hanging on.
It takes a real man to admit he's wrong. Thanks for this Will, you didn't try to deflect or make excuses. I really hope that one day you and Chris can be friends again.
People make mistakes. Fewer people make mistakes on this scale. I hope he’s sincere in this apology but it will be a minute before chris, his family, and people in general will actually forgive him. Out of all of the apologies I’ve seen, this aint bad.
Chris aint gonna stay mad.....who could stay mad at Will Smith?
im glad he used his youtube because i will never watch his wife's red table, we all make mistakes thankyou for not falling in to a bottle or worse when enduring the backlash, n with time people will see you as the decent human you are but this time round they'll see you as a human not mr. perfect because thats unattainable and isnt maintainable n really isnt fair, we want you as you are, you are enough. oh n as for those you feel you let down, redemption is never out of reach just be weary of false prophets, with time i think you'll be fine.
He likes the word moment…😅
Uhmm....Now I am loving you again...
I feel like it’s a sincere and genuine apology, he made no excuses.
You inspire me; you always have, and always will.
Sad that you’ve had to apologize again. This is between the two of you. People have no right to act offended by what happened. Like, seriously, why do anyone else care? Your career shouldn’t be hurt by this, and we’ll always be here to support you in whatever you do. Millions of us love you and your family, and nobody will take you down. Stay strong.
Actors gonna act
Welcome back!❤️❤️
I don’t think you will ever gain the fame back which you had…but I still think Will really means he is really sorry for what he has done and I think he is not doing this to get his fame back.
To those who were quick to judge you Will,they never knew how you felt after that..this is the best thing to happen to internet today that you've apologised publicly....the world needed this...thank you.
The problem is, I can not tell if you are being sincere or if you are just that talented of an actor.
Apologise video,now you are officially A YouTuber Will.
Will comes off as fake here. I think he should be arrested for what he did.
Bravo beautiful soul
What I like about this apology is that Will seems genuine while also respecting Chris's feelings of not being ready to speak. It's unfortunate that it was so public due to the men involved and the venue, but I feel it is something that time will be able to heal eventually, even if there are some scars left later on.
Still all about him
Bruh u he couldve just left this alone and not said anything everyone already forgot lol.
Love. Love. Love. We are all a work in progress my brother. Peace be unto you.
We forgive you. Don't be ashamed of yourself. Be ashamed of that action you made. We ALL messed up at some point and we've all lost friends because of it in the process. But we're still standing trying to be better today.
Tutt'apposto compà
You are human and better than most for expressing yourself with so much accountability. Still my idol
Did the Illuminati let you back in yet?
Much love Will. Much love ❤️
Asking for forgiveness is a powerful thing!! Good job Sir!
Fake sorry
It would be nice to know how your son felt the need to post the same amount of disrespect on Twitter.   Toxic and so far detached from reality.  In all your regret did you condemn his actions? Why apologize to him in particular when he was a contributor to your actions.  Twitter is just as much a weapon as your hand on Mr. Rock's face.
It hurts  to see you  hurt my guy.. but you can fix all this.. keep learning,  be better
I love you, Will. Just glad to see you’re okay🤎
That was hard to watch. My heart goes out to you will. And everyone else effected by this.
Love you Will! like you said "Im human" and we all make mistakes. Its the growing and moving forward which is the most important lesson, and also forgiving ones self after acknowledging your mistake. Wish you all the best moving forward ❤
Suffered From The Same Trauma Most Of My Life (People Pleasing/Didn't Want To Disappoint Anyone) For Most Of My Life. But When I Started My Healing Journey I Begin To Realize That I Was Driving Myself Insane And That Had To Stop. Do I Like Being Dependable, Yes But No Longer Will I Break My Neck To Please Anyone. And I've Learned That If I Cannot Do Something For Someone, I Apologize And Keep It Moving. I Had To Learn ( The Hard Way Lol) That You Can't Live Life Always Trying To Please Others. You'll Be Alright Will 🙏🏽. Just Continue On Your Healing Journey And Grow From This 🙏🏽 😊
Time for you to retire from the spotlight. Scientology did this to you. Do something about that.
💙💙💙💙💙
We are all human Will.  We all make mistakes.   Unfortunately,  this one was broadcast on live TV.  Most of us don't have to deal with our mistakes in front of the world.  I'm glad to see your face.  I can imagine what these last few months have been like, but know we're all here, we love you, we support you & there is NO ONE out there who is perfect. 💝💝💝💝💝
Not the optimal… but A way. You can see him struggle even with this. Arrogance & insecurity. But he has future movies coming out so needs to house clean before he’s back for public adoration.
Of course he fucked up, who never fucked up hands in the air.... no one is perfect much love light and healing to all affected. Every thing happens for a reason and this has brought out the real Will Smith... Still a fan always will...
We love you Will! You’re a great man and such an inspiration to us all. We are human and we all make mistakes. The important thing is to learn from those mistakes and try not to make them again. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
👏👏👏 I've  been there.
I love you will, keep doing your best and being awesome.
Thuggish behaviour on his part. His apologies are a little too late.
Literally u will always be the fresh prince!!! much love!!!
Honestly, it's no one's business but yours and his. Work it out amongst each other, don't worry about our feelings on it, as it's none of our concern. I am glad you're okay. He'll be okay. Everyone will be okay and life will go on. Those with a brain in their heads will still be behind you, especially with your acknowledgement of the issue.
I'll care when Chris accepts his apology or not.
Great Move. Keep moving forward.
Good on you Will for taking some time to apologise, learn, and re-orient yourself.
am hurt too, where is my apology video?
all boldies fault
"I'm human and I made a mistake" has got to be the single worst thing to say in an apology
I was such a big fan of you Sir. Now you serve as an example to my three sons of what not to do. Of how not to behave. I had you so high up in a pedestal, with such respect because of how you behaved, how you handled yourself through the ups and downs.  It saddens me how you changed my feelings for you in a blink of an eye.
We are all humans man 🙏
He seems very sincere and I hope it is. He is a good actor though, so who knows.
Alright fine
You've won the most prestigious prize an actor can win, you ruined that moment in the worst way possible. YOUR moment. I'm sorry, even if your apologies are real, you can't turn back the time. You have temper issues. You've not so nice after all.
July 2022. Come for a run in the Yorkshire Dales Will, we're all human
یک مرد بزرگ که به راحتی همه چیو از دست داد💔🖤❤
Hey, Big Willie Style! Listen, WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES....only those committed by super-stars get magnified especially when they occur live before the cameras for all the world to see. This apology which I believe is sincere will also be seen by the masses. It should be enough.  Your fans, of whom I count myself among, will support you because we know you're only human. And in that moment you acted off raw human emotions that were real. I would not dare to condone what you did, but as a husband and a father, I can understand your actions even though in hindsight I think we can agree there were better ways you could have handled that situation. But in that moment, you did what you felt you had to do.  We live and we learn allowing our mistakes to be teachable moments and we get better.  So, continue to get better. And when you're ready we'll see you on the big screen again hopefully soon.  God bless, peace and love.
At the next awards show, Will should let Chris smack him with a pie. I think that would be a fitting comedic end to all of this.
💓💓💓
Sounds like Mr. Smith is learning his place in the larger order of things.  Well done 👏
Mistakes happen, we all mess up sometimes. As long as we can see it , own up to it, and make it right .. be good y’all
Respect For Admitting Your Wrong Doings & Owning Them With No Excuses!! 👊🏾 🖤 🇬🇧
I love will all the best to u
After watching this the first thing I thought about was "First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil For real, you are the only father that I ever knew if I get my girl pregnant I'ma be a better you". At your highest moment, be careful,  because that's when the devil comes for you I hope you remember this Will and stay grounded I am saying that with much love and much respect. I think genuinely people know you are a happy-go-lucky person and kind at heart
This clown should box Jake Paul
Grateful for your statement.  Keep your head up.  Stay on your path.  You do much more good and lots more to come from you.  He who is without sin... Be blessed and go forward!
❤️❤️❤️
I was disturbed seeing this unfold. I like many see Will and Chris as brothers; two of the good guys. Today I feel a ton of relief after watching this heartfelt apology because it just wasn’t a good feeling as I argued inside my own mind to feel the feelings, to think the words to no longer like a guy we’ve all loved since parents just don’t understand.  I’m going to cut to the point in my response by saying, thank you my brother for opening up, like a man, stepping up and apologizing to so many on so many levels. You made a mistake and today your apology was felt. Thank you for allowing me to say I forgive you because I was holding in something that had nothing to do with me but because you have been such an amazing part of this life journey, I got caught up and literally felt stuck.  You’re still that brother from another mother. Uncle Phil would be proud. Happy Friday 29 July 2022.
you're human. the vitriol needs to stop.....those in glasshouses need to tread lightly
We love you Will! ❤️❤️💗💗💙💙
Love you Will!
looking forward to seeing this new will smith apology video in all the upcoming youtuber apology tier list videos
Bro people been mad about that shi he said?
Everybody loves Will Smith. I think we all were torn between who to favor in the event. I still support both of these greats. Chris and Will.
First and foremost I am from Philadelphia PA!!! I have loved you and Jazz Jeff as a kid and even more now at 46yrs!!!!❤️❤️❤️ Will you are a human being 1st! Sometimes we go through things in life to help us grow.🙏🙏🙏 Don't ever stop being you!!!! The fact that you came on here to admit your faults, shows your remorse. I believe God can and will forgive you and fix this. I need you to forgive yourself Will Smith!!!! Keep your head up and trust the process!!!!! God Bless you and stay safe 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 ❤️ 💙 💛
@behavioral arts all you man!
❤️❤️❤️
Love you will ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Will, your human bro and made a mistake just like we all have. No love lost, grow from this and continue to be great.💯
Will is a real dude. We are all human. There are bad things that we’ve all done in the past, which we wish could just go away, or never come back to haunt us again. Everyone who has judged Will on his actions, all have something in their past too(be it big or small) no one is exempt. We all deserve a second chance, a third chance, or fourth chance,… Until we all get it right for ourselves. This is what life is about. Growing, excepting, correcting, becoming better, and living. You (we) make a mistake - correct it… And don’t do it again. This is him correcting this past mistake. I still have respect for Will. I love both Chris and Will. They’re both real dudes. I can easily forgive him. Just like most people wish that they can also be easily forgiven as well 🙏🏾. Stay Up.
You are inspirational
It’s the first step in the right direction 👍
I salute you big dawg. Still one of my favorite actors and ppl. No less a role model to me than you were before. Praying for yall
Well all make mistakes, I’m just pissed bad boys 4 canceled over it😂😂
Don't feel bad man , maybee if you'd make this video earlier was better but still( never to late to mend)and don't feel guilty about what happend anymore and hope to get back to your friendship with chris💥love ya
It does take real courage to sit down and own up to your mistakes 💯. Proud of you Will❤️
You are are you will always be our Prince 👑 no matter what
This is way overdue and likely too late for the general public. You didn't take accountability at the time or immediately after. Your privilege kept you from more serious ramifications.
Reading your book I understand
Will!! You know we love you right, regardless right! I’ve been missing your face, so nice to see you
You good bro …a moment in time but heal that pain inside✌🏾
Si me preguntan esta historia tiene 2 versiones tú eres humano y es normal reaccionarias así por tu esposa. Y por otro lado como figura pública hicistes mal pero eso fue ya tiempo . Te disculpas y tienes que seguir adelante no dejes que te afecte. También Chris no debió hacer bromas sin tu consentimiento acerca de tu esposa. Pero bueno la vida sigue ya olvida eso. Te amamos Legenda💗🇭🇳🇭🇳🇭🇳
While you are watching my apology that is a day late and a dollar short, buy this overpriced book! Thanks
Outside of fame and wealth, you are still human and flawed just like the rest of us. We all make mistakes, regardless of our socio economic background, age, race or ethnicity. When we make our mistakes, we should learn from them and hope that anyone we hurt in the process has forgiven us for our transgressions, when we apologize. I know you are religious and I know you already asked God for forgiveness and this is your second apology to Chris. You have done all you can and the fans, your friends and your family who loves you ,sees that you are trying. In the end, you cant force Chris to accept your apology and I pray overtime he will,but continue to give him the space to deal with this in his own way and on his own time.  In the meantime, ignore the nay sayers and hateful people, there are a lot more ppl that loves " Will Smith" than who hates him. We who love you are behind you and continue to support and purchase your content. Peace love and blessings.
Leave her.
Fake apology the house
Man has 2 choices in life.. Empowerment or Imprisonment     .. Anton Chekhov
The rule is, be the first to apologize for your ill actions, never apologize for your perspective. There's a way to go about the former without compromising the latter. You did what you did cuz that's how you felt, stand on it tactfully. This just screams a man imprisoned in his own success, bless him.
Much love, Will. You're still a king, bro.
I just love Will Smith!!!
We won’t forget…
Like it or not black Americans carry a huge burden when in the public eye. Your action setback a lot of black folks already being held down and that is unforgivable.
He will make $100k on this monetized apology
Im done with Will Smith . Period.
There’s still a large audience who still love and support you, Will.  That being said, you should’ve waited until you had a private talk with Chris and came to amends before coming back to the public, but I get it, your business can’t stop for that long. This was a great set, great branded props, and prompted questions and responses. You have a great team and I hope you don’t ever take that for granted. Glad therapy is working for you.
It takes a lot of courage to admit when you made a mistake and own up to it.  We are all human and nobody is perfect.  The standard that he was trying to live up to for all these years must of been overwhelming.  Much respect to a true Philly King.
i am here to dislike only
That felt sincere to me props to you Will.
Love that! Thank you for taking the time to come out with humility and sincerity. I’m confident you’ll continue to fill the world with love and service!
🥺💙💪🏾🗣 so strong of you inspiring to me! Never could look at you doing no wrong but have realize you are human just like me! I hope you two can come to amending..
We never stop being friends ❤️🙏🏾
We love you! ♥️
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Take your time man, take your time. Take care
If we forgave BP for that huge oil spill in Mexico! Man we forgive you! We love you
This was one of the most heartfelt apologies I’ve seen and felt in a long time. There’s no love lost. We are all human abs capable of messing up. In the big scheme of things I’ve messed up way more than what you did and my apology wasn’t nearly as thought out and sincere. So in that sense, even in your mistake you’re still teaching. We love you Will, nothing is gonna change that. I accept your apology and I’m proud at your emotional growth during the months that’s you’ve been away.
Your are well. Everything's gonna be alright. Thank you for sharing yourself with us! 🖤🤲🏾✨✨✨
You were my favorite star since I was going up watching Fresh Prince then moved to Bad Boys and then to your serious roles. After the Oscar’s I was deeply shocked and can not watch your old and new movies again. This post is a step forward in your healing and the healing for all your true fans- like myself. The only thing wrong with this post is- why is it only 5 minute long? I am sure there are lots more question you a pan answer. But like I said before, it is a step forward, now let’s make Bad Boys 4….
Nah fam....not gon fly blood.  U did foul n'' sh!t homie.  No luv bruh. This sho aint the way big man   u trippn
I respect the effort
wE aLl mAke mIstAkEs - every single clown in these comments
Will.. we luv u bro..the world done get over it bro
I think this is great, good work!
I’m glad you apologized. Still love you, Will!!
OK I will watch I am legend part two when it comes out
I'm sorry.....please go see Bad Boy 9
I’m so proud of u ❤️💪🏽🙏🏻
Fair play to him for apologising (especially for apologising to Rock's mother). He kinda dodges the question about why he didn't apologise in his speech, on the night, though. Smith says he was 'fogged-out' or whatever, but not so much that he couldn't give a self-congratulating, hyperbolic, messianic speech about how he's a protector etc. And probably the worst part of the whole thing, in terms of how much it seemed to mean to Smith that he clattered a guy on TV over next to nothing, was how he spent the entire night dancing and singing (sometimes to his own songs), and soaking up all the glory and congratulation. If he was 'fogged-out' it wasn't just with rage, it was with his sense of self-importance - the latter lasted well into the wee hours of the night, and at least until he saw the bad press he was getting.
❤
It took you long enough. This should’ve happened on stage. You coward.
Chris and his family are trying to heal from their public embarrassment, but in a narcissistic move to reconnect with your base you put out a video knowing media outlets will cover it and breathe life right back into an event the public has long moved past?
Stay Fresh, prince.
You deserve forgiveness, but it'll be difficult to get back where you were in the public eye!
Thats not a genuine apology, thanks an excuse. If you were poor and white you'd be in jail right now period.
Much love and RESPECT  to you Will. ❤
Good to see you brother hope you are good
I’d try to believe him if he wasn’t pushing his own brand 🤑
I could give 2 shits about what actors do in their personal lives. Will Smith has among the best bodies of work in Hollywood. Get back on the horse and do something great, Will. The fans want to see it.
I'm just stating that I respect Will for being human. I respect Will for always trying to improve himself. We as people  are on a journey for self improvement. No judgment from my imperfect self, and I suggest those who do judge to just think about the number of people who have forgiven you. Glad to see Will is facing this wisely,  millions of your supporters still support you. 💯
We love u Will ❤️🥰Everyone makes mistakes nobody is perfect you are amazing.God bless u always 🙏🏻Stay Strong 💪🏽 You’re a good man💙❤️🙏🏻
People make mistakes. I just hope the world will allow Will to work through this and live without feeling awful for the rest of his life. Yes it was bad and yes it was uncalled for but should he be able to make it right, yes he should. One moment in life doesnt define a man. I still love you Will.
💯
The Top G is back, Will is a legend no matter what!
Don't worry bruh...we still love you. You And Chris will be fine 🙂
I wonder if Will would go to therapy and talk to someone. There is no shame there. Something triggered him that night and so made if he understands his triggers it can help him heal. Believe me we have pain from childhood and sometimes different parts of you don’t get healing. So I wish Will Smith well and healing . We are all human .
We’ve all had moments we wish we could take back! You apologize and taking responsibility for your actions and that’s all that matter…take your time and get yourself together then get back to work. We still need you Will! God bless
Will: AND I want to apologize Chris 's mother  Chris somewhere: keep my mother's name out of Ur F**** mouth  Na just kidding Will, u re.great guy, some people might say it s to late but I think this Is something that has to be done. Yes or yes.
We love you, Will. You and Chris will get through this! Life can sometimes catch you on the blindside but keep your head up ♥️♥️♥️♥️
You are a Nice man Will!!   I am your Big Fan!!   You don't deserve going though all this Situation 😔😔
How can a person be let down by a person they don’t know ? Any adult should not be effected by the way a celebrity acts.
Much love ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
not buying it champ
Nothing more I can say then what’s already been said here by others. I love you Will! All the best to you and time truly heals! Be well my man and can’t wait to see what you do next!!! ✌🏼❤️
The fact of the matter is, he screwed up and his reputation will be tarnished for the rest of his life. That being said (like he said), he's only human. We all make mistakes in life. As long as we learn from our mistakes, that's what really matters. It's going to take time, but I respect the fact that he attempted to apologize as best he could, all things considered.
We all make mistakes. Thank you for doing this.
❤️
You’ve acknowledged your mistake numerous times. You’ve extended an apology to everyone dear to your heart and beyond. Move past the moment by forgiving yourself. That moment does not define you. Your journey is continuing as it should…one day at a time. Keep pressing!! Keep moving forward 💜🥰
Move on. Get past it. Move forward. You've apologized soooo much. Chris should not of run his mouth.
LOVE YOU !
It's okay.  No man is superman. While you did hurt others forgiveness is there.
Appreciate that this is a really apology. You made a bad choice. Been there. I hope you two strong, talented black men work it out❤️❤️❤️
Personally done with you Wil, forever. You have shown yourself to be a great disappointment.  6 months later, This should have been done during your acceptance speech from the car after leaving the awards when you were asked. You embarrassed your family and the nation. This will take time for Black America to for give that embarrassing display of childish retaliation.  Just stay out of the public eye until you make it right with the plaintiff.
I understand what you did. I still love and support you.
he actually seems really sorry, y'all are too hard on celebrities they are human too and make mistakes just bc their social status yall act like they cant ever f up smh. thanks will <3
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Back to work !
Only the brave have the strength to stand up and apologize repeatedly.  It is true, it was a mistake, but only that, as any human being does.  And as human beings we must learn to forgive and move on 💪
Will Smith , you are one of my favourite personalities but sorry Will you lost my trust and support.
todos cometemos errores y el tuyo no es grabe hay personas que hacen cosas peores .. eres un gran ser humano  , eres HUMANO y no tienes que cumplir las expectativas de la gente ...disculparte ya dice mucho de ti eres un gran hombre .
I agree with so much of yalls comments. But,  The way he made a peer, a grown man look so vulnerable on national television im sure was beyond mortifying! I wouldnt be ready to talk if i was chris either. I am all for forgiveness but he let his girls emotions turn him inside out and he had no repercussions whatsoever. So i think thats why this falls so flat for me. He lost nothing except our respect ..his fans were let down because specifically what he stands (stood?) for. I dont think he should get his fans back so easy for being man enough to apologize like any human being should .. then i think if this were my family member id want him to be forgiven idk yall tough!
Better question: Why will you not find another handler? We believe in you
FINALLY
I’m proud of will. He looks health and he took time to really reflect on his actions. Good you you Will.
Apology is a lovely perfume; it can transform the clumsiest moment into a gracious gift.  ~Margaret Lee Runbeck
Huh
This apology seemed thoughtful, he made the right choice by working on himself and reflecting instead of an insincere apology because he felt forced to do.
🤝🏻Thank you for your answers and explanations, peace to all!!!
I can only tell you that despite everything you continue with my support and in my case I do not feel disappointed in you, quite the opposite.
Love will smith but he’s sitting here acting like Jayda didn’t do nun
Respect this. 🙏🏽
Too late. Waited way too long to address this. You took that day away from many other people that was their night too. Sorry, just not enough for me.
It ok. You a real youtuber now......
We are ALL still learning. We are ALL still making mistakes. We are ALL still growing. You may have lost a friend in Chris. Friends are not always forever, but I/everyone wishes you can get past this. It will be difficult he feels betrayed by someone who he thought would never hurt him. Good for you to apologize. Learn and move on, continuing to work on progressing. Looking only forwards!
Mr Smith, I'm 100℅ with you. When it happened I was 100℅ with you, I have my reasons. I said in the past I wished the people that say that they love me, loved me as you love your family. Please DO NOT listen to a hypocrite society, who dare to point with the finger but let all the belittling happen online and on TV. You are a good man, you have always been. The hypocrites are still out there with a chip on their shoulder.
Good job Will.
Your a real one for this one Will so I really do think y’all should talk it out
💪🏻❤️
I dont believe that she had nothing to do with it. The video tells a different story
👍
before I watch: I hope he actually answers why he laughed and then out of nowhere flipped out within the same minute, at the same thing. EDIT: he did not.
We been through this , both just you Will ❤️ I have felt the same way when I got mad at someone who I truly admired and care for . We still love and respect you will ❤️ God bless you and your family ❤️
Respect brother 🫡
I think you had reason for what you did and we don’t deserve your explanation.
Well. Some things are just out there and you have to realize they don’t get taken back with an apology.   It’s not your job to disappoint me or not disappoint me.  Your behavior was inexcusable, not unacceptable. How long will it take Chris to feel at ease again on stage, earning a living in what is his livelihood?
Nah bruh, he's just doing this because them scripts not coming in like they used to
We all make mistakes. So many of Will's worst critics are HATERS who were never fans. His fans accept his apology and want life to move forward.
Everyone makes mistakes, it just usually doesn't happen on national television. Many are first to point fingers without realizing, as they say, there are three fingers pointing back at them.
the world is beautiful.. there are some sick people.. love is the cure!
Much love and respect. We are humans we make mistakes it how we grow from them that make us better. He will forgive as well. God bless you and keep being the Great person you are and my #1 Actor of all times.
We all have made mistakes as unperfect beings. Keep working and growing my brother. This unfortunate mistake doesn't erase the example of a successful black man that you have set and given so many something to aim for. Much love, fam!!!!
I applaud you for going to these lengths but every single person on this planet have caused hurt either physically or emotionally. Don't put that pressure on yourself King.
Meh.
Regardless to what even when the situation happened I STILL LOVED AND SUPPORTED YOU WILL. I LOVE YOU STILL. GOD HAS FORGIVEN YOU. IT MAY TAKE TIME BUT IN TIME YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FORGIVE YOURSELF. YOUR HUMAN. You made a human mistake. Why people idolize other humans as if they're God is beyond me.  I stand with you my brother/uncle/friend in Christ 😘🙏🏾
Lol he's back glad to see ya back will
It's been a minute because your PR team knew how important this would be.
this will get meme'd furiously
We got you Will!  Our arms are big enough for you and Chris. Love you both
Proud of you!!
We ALL make mistakes Will. You are owning it and you apologized. I'm ok with it. Best of luck to you and the fam moving forward.
We’re all hanging on.
...........
❤❤❤❤❤
I'm so sorry 3 months later. Totally genuine btw 😂👍
A heartfelt apology from a passionate person. Who among us hasn't said or done something in the heat of a moment that we later regretted? Everyone makes mistakes but not everyone learns from them. Good on you Will for taking responsibility and owning up to a mistake. I can definitely see you and Chris being even better friends again in the future since you're both bright, caring, compassionate people. ☮️
Nice acting ! Fake, lame....
He's made a mistake, he's apologised, he's said he was wrong and done it publicly. Fair play. 🤷‍♂️👏
KevOnStage sent me here to support. 🎬🫂🙏🏾
Sr. I’m happy to see you 🙏. We all are in so difficult times that is overwhelming and exhausting trying to keep on the positive path without falling in sadness, anger, frustration etc. You are HUMAN and sorry but you can’t please every body. Always we will find someone who’s waiting for a mistake to judge. You have done EVERYTHING to bring peace, love, respect to the world. Please don’t be so hard on you. We are here for you when you’re ready 😊😊 We really love you and want you well 🙏🙏
Will, many years ago, I went to a concert for L.L. Cool J and others here in Philly. (Can’t remember anyone else because I’m old 😆) You were on the floor area with Rakim, Eric B and others. I spent about half an hour calling out “Fresh Prince” from my seat. You finally heard me and looked up. I said “congratulations on winning your 1st Grammy” (1st rapper to receive it!! 🥳) You smiled, put your hands in prayer and mouthed thank you. That moment has remained in my heart and mind for many years. In that moment, I knew you were a good person and God would Bless you. You were a humble man then, and I still see that person now. We all make mistakes. We’re only human. Thank you for making a young girl feel so special and a now grown woman feel so proud. 💜 God Bless
no. bad. boring. nah not rlly into it
Respect
I think Cris can forgive BUT he will never forget because Will's action was a legendary...and things will never be the same.
Finally.. should've done this way earlier.
Will is gonna come back, his expression feels genuine.
Too late
always love you, Will!!!
Smiths clone?
Thanks for taking the time to share your journey.
way late, people have moved on. you've tarnished your own reputation with those actions. it's sad because i used to be a big fan of yours
It's okay to feel shame
I still dont like him
Your still my favorite ether way
Will you are human and a good one at that. I agree you made a huge misjudgment. You’re not going to get a life sentence from us! We all make mistakes.   Love does heal even if it’s through the pain of healing.   I’m sure you will all find a place in your hearts to humble yourselves and recognize that hurt people hurt people.   Get help to also deal with the circumstances that caused you to choose that method of resolve.   God is able to heal. Be honest too with the process.
Glad to see you King. Be the conqueror you are.🫶🏾🥂
This is crazy to see.
Mistakes are made ...... you are in the limelight. You are a most amazing man. None of us know what it cost you to be you. I am praying for you and with you. 🙏🏾💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥🙏🏾
That was thoughtful to apologize to not only Chris but to everyone it affected. It is humbling to make a live apology and rewarding for you as well. We are all human, we all make mistakes. If God can forgive us how are we not to forgive one another? Thank you for standing up for what was done to Chris and I pray he too and anyone else it effected can forgive you as well. I have been a fan of your work and I hope to see you back out there doing films. God Bless you and your family. Your forgiven.
Will gonna do like K.Spacey... a YTube video once a year. Lol
The apology needs to be louder than the action and the whole world saw the action. Stop apologizing to the audience, and go find chris and sit down. Yall be handling this worse than high-school girls. Remember the 90s when you'd get In a brawl with someone then be partying with them by the weekend. He don't have a restraining order. Go talk to him ya rich bastard
To err, is human as we all have experienced. To do the work to admit, accept, and apologize without an "if" is greater, is healing, it is divine.   Will Smith, thank you for moving in the divine.
Ahaaaaahaa that's hot! 🤣
Will, I just want to say that I've always had love for you and Chris. Both of you were part of my childhood and now adulthood. We all have made some stupid mistakes - Lord knows I have, and probably still will - but it's the bounce back from them that's important. You'll bounce back. Some things will be different but in the end, you'll be okay. I do hope that you and Chris can salvage your friendship. Take care of yourself, bruh, and much love.
🤗
So they took everything from this man because he put his hands on another man. He didn’t rape anyone, molest  anyone,nothing like that. He smacked another man and that’s that. Are we really going to make this man some type of villain? Why are Weinstein movies still being played everywhere, but  the Cosby show is nowhere to be found. F the system that has made this man a villain but Ben Franklin is still on the $100 bill.
Can we get an apology for Wild Wild West now?
blah, blah, blah... blah, blah, blah... Go woke go broke, your brain right now
thats question is from ur side, not from us. sooo yeah idk
Will Smith I thought you were a gentleman did you learn already when you get out of the ghetto you're still on the ghetto you're a hoochie man and you know that you never gonna change
atleast do some retakes went a bit too emotionless at the end there
Will , my Heart goes out to You. I’m empathetic to Your Plight. So many people was Nosy and coming at You sideways. Chris happened to Come with it at the wrong time. Please know we’re all a Work in Progress. You have King David’s Repentful Spirit so it’ll be alright .
Pieces of $h!t don't take ownership or apologize for their mistakes. When my son is older I can point to this as an example of how a real man picks himself back up after he falls.
Will Smith was my favorite actor , and now unfortunately his ego has gotten so large it's swallowed up the real Will
But why you got the mean Mario hat on? Wario!
You showed your true colors. It appears as your SO continues to walk all over you and THAT is when and how you decide to take action? It was incredibly wrong and you don’t deserve the chance to reconcile.
That practical light behind his head is… hilarious. Sometimes it’s centered like a halo.
Love and respect you still, Will! The first blunder you made in a 30+ year career and folks ready to throw you away! Not I!
It breaks my heart to see this man in this much pain. You’ve got a good heart man this one event doesn’t define you. I can’t speak for everyone else but as someone who has looked up to you my entire life I forgive you.
💕 You are an amazing person. Thank you so much for showing others how to own your actions.
To you my man Will Smith, I have and still am a fan my brother, I've always loved your positivity and I do believe that the light from the true and living GOD still shines in you. We all fall short, and have those bad days but it's what we learn from our mistakes and how we come back / correct them if possible.
I'm still going to watch bad boys 4
it hurts to watch this. you were my favourite actor. funny, amazing, glorious. you have lost that. I'm sad about this. and I'm sure everyone still is sad about this also. 😕
Wow. That really tugged at my heartstrings, especially the part about disappointing people. Cautiously hopeful to see how the situation turns around.
For those who see through the mist, I applaud you. Never ever believe a narcissist.
Your true fans were never not rocking with you big dog. Dude's been holding it down for black men in the public eye since the 80s. He deserves a mulligan.
Thing is, there’s a lot of comments here saying “we forgive you will” but to be honest it isn’t for us to forgive him. It’s up to Chris. He can only make that call.
Proud of you
👍👏👏👏
It's ok Will.  Allways 💜  Mashona Buma.
Little late but glad to see you acting like the Will Smith I grew up with.
“I was still fogged out.”  I love that line!  I’ll have to remember that!
I´m proud of you will. Best regards Will!!!!
None of my films are getting greenlit...........
i can feel the hurt in the tone of your voice. i wish you nothing but healing
Super Smit Super ⭐
All the remorse in the world but only AFTER the money starts gettin fucked with
Will Smith You A Great Blessed Person and seeing you apologize to Chris stay strong Will Smith You Be Back Soon For Your Come back!!!
As far as I'm concerned I just want Will back.  I consider all of this none of my business.  I'm only watching because I want to hear if we will get Will back.  As far as I'm concerned, 99% of this is between Will, Chris and their people.  Peace!
You're a man. There are falls along the way.Its good you're trying to make amends.Thats what being a man is all about.
I honestly haven’t been interested in watching any of your content since that punk move you pulled. He’s half your size bro…
I grew up watching the fresh prince and there's not one bit of me that can picture Will being a malicious or inherently evil guy. He made a mistake as we all have in our lives and he's owning up to it. Good on Will and I only wish the best for him, his family and Chris.
Aw man, thanks for coming through with this, Will. A lot of us had remained loyal to you, despite the situation. I  guess I knew that you'd reply authentically, eventually. All true Will Smith fans did. Yeah, it's been a minute, but thanks for giving us these five. 👊🏾   Peace!
PR Waffle
Man, hope he'll be alright. Hope we're all be alright. Will knows he didn't do the right thing so he deserves forgiveness.
Jade didn’t need to tell you to do anything. You just saw her roll her eyes and you realised she would have cracked the whip harder if you didn’t do her dirty work. 🤦‍♂️
You should of the night off straight after not months later
Disappointing fans is one thing. But the MOST important thing here is Chris and then his family. Put your focus there. I don't know if you have ever been bullied, but the emotional tsunami that is still washing over him now, even 3 months later, is big, believe me. Bigger than even he might allow himself to acknowledge. Focus on Chris dude.
You can take the guy out of the ghetto, But you can't take the ghetto out of the guy.
He doesn’t owe an apology to any of us.  Zero.   He owes nothing to us.    However, I see more regret and forgiveness seeking from a dog who tore up a pillow than I got from this man.    I mean, considering what he did is FOREVER documented for Chris to see, his family to see, for the entirety of their lives, this dude should literally be on his knees begging for their forgiveness.    It will NEVER go away for them for as long as they live.   Ever.     All the nominees and especially winners who’s life long dream of winning was forever hijacked by this dudes idiocy, he can never give them that moment back.   Ever.  I just figure for what he did and the lifelong impact it will forever have for as long as humans and social media lives on, he should have demonstrated faaaaaaaaaaaaaar more remorse and humilty.  He still has much work to do before he makes another video.
Wishing you nothing but blessings and healing! Love you, Will!
God help us all if we were  defined by 1 misstep or mistake. I'm still proud of Will Smith and think he's a great role model.
Damm that was hard to watch
We love you, Will! ❤️
Anyone know where that polo is from?
Good start. It's tough to be a man.
Your trauma is not dissapointing people, your trauma is being dissapointed
Timing is everything. So with that in mind, why is the video coming out now? It’s simple. His career has been so severely damaged, that he can’t get work, he’s toxic and no one, anywhere, wants to have anything to do with him this many months later. Why else would you do this video? He’s still trying to clean up the mess and that’s everything behind why he’s doing this video now. He’s desperate.
❤️🙏🏽
I still love you Will. Thank you for your apology; it took courage, humility and bravery. I hope that one day in the very near future that you and Chris can have a one on one conversation so that both of you and your families can heal and move forward. Life is too short. Much love 💕 and peace ✌️
Takes a big man to admit he made a mistake. Will smith is a great man.
Your real fans are behind you. All of us make mistakes, hurt people, say something bad, we become this evil all of a sudden. But there’s always room to  improve ourselves and develop right attitude.
Te queremos Will Smith desde  Puerto Rico!!
People in the comments saying they forgive him but who cares if YOU forgive him.. does CHRIS forgive him??   Respect can take a lifetime to earn but can be lost in seconds and sadly Will has forever tarnished his accomplished legacy wether you *true fans* accept it or not.  But I honestly feel that he hasn’t addressed the root of the problem. It wasn’t about Chris…
So happy to see you again. I understand you are working through things. You are human like the rest of us BUT I've missed your energy on social media. So glad you are not giving up. So glad you are showing the world we all act out of pocket at times but you work through it and keep doing what you love. All the support and love to you and yours. We'll be here patiently waiting for your humble yet entertaining return.
I adore how you know what u done was unacceptable but this world is to Dam soft. What I'm not gone do is come on here acting as if what he done hurt me to a point I would no longer support him. Gtfoh. Stop projecting self disappointment on him because u need to focused on the people who betray you on the daily that u chose to ignore. But u find it fit to hold him accountable? Gtfoh. Its as I said: To dam soft! In any relationship of any kind, we mess up and if the person who messed up realizes what he or she done wrong and is willing to work towards the betterment of oneself than NOBODY has the right to take his or her progress away from them by allowing something he/she done in the past to linger over their heads.  & Will Stop it! You need to forgive yourself.  Dosent matter who does or don't forgive u in this time. The real people gone ride with u and the false prophets gone cease and that's exactly what u need❤
The worst part of this was I looked up to you so much before this. I listened to a speech you gave once and I was floored by it. You always exude such positive vibes. Making a "mistake" happens and we all been there but this was more of a cry for help than someone slipping up and having a moment. I truly hope you and Chris work things out and are at the very least civil with eachother moving forward. As for myself, I won't hold you to such high regards again. I just can't. I hope the best for you and your mental state. I dont presume to know your life and situation but can see clear as day that there is behind the scenes demons haunting you. I hope you return back to your positive ways.
missed you man. look i was angry when it happened, but we all make mistakes. and we have to learn from them and be better.
KEEP MY WIFES NAME OUT YOUR MF MOUTH
Concentrez vous sur les bons commentaires mr smith !   Tous les autres sont justes des gens aigri et jaloux qui aiment voir la vie des autres aussi triste que la leur !  Ou sûrement des ados débile !  TOUS CEUX QUI LE DESCENDE VOUS ÊTES loin d'être parfait et votre haine le prouve !  Will smith est un humain extraordinaire et imparfait mais il l'assume ,  contrairement à vous !  Will ❤
Staged
Some people couldn't wait for him to make a mistake.
Everyone makes mistakes Will, all you can do is to learn from them, and not repeat them again. Just remember it's not a life sentence. Much love Will
Will apologised ONCE. That's enough. No need to apologise further.  These hypocrites will have you over a barrel apologising for the rest of your life if you let them.
Stop apologizing! Once twelve times over is enough!!!!
I applaud 👏 you for saying your peace and lifting that weight off of you. I know Chris is probably still upset and probably in time you two can talk. No one is prefect and Everyone Makes Mistakes.  We never know what someone is going through internally/mentally. The least little thing can make up snap or trigger us into a reaction from something. Does it make it Right? No But like I said before No One Is Prefect and We All Make Mistake. All we can do is Learn From Them.  Love you Will and I will alway have your back. Keep Your Head Up!
If they don't want to f*ck with you afterwards.....life goes on. Society sits on sh#t. PLEASE stop beating yourself up about this. You BEEN forgiven LONG time back. 💯🕊😝🤙🏾💚 #stayrockingwithwill
Based on these comments, us fans are still here with you through whatever work you feel you need to do. We’re fans of both yours and Chris Rock’s so we all want the best outcome, whatever that may be between you. It’s commendable for any person to own up to their mistakes, I can’t even imagine how it’s like being such a huge celebrity/public figure. Thank you for sharing your personal growth with us, we’re all learning the lessons along with you.
Always been a big fan and I was really chocked when it happend. But I also realise what pain and trauma can do to a person. Will and his family have been going through a really hard time. That is definitly not an excuse but I can understand that at a point you Just explode and lose control for a minute. I have expirienced it myself before so I get it. I am happy you apoligized and adressed the situation. A lot of people Just move on and ignore it so we really appreciate this , love you a lot always ❤
That was not good brother
Keep your pimp hand strong 💪
Well done man. ❤ Hopefully you'll get chris to talk.
Not genuine at all.  If anyone else had done this.. JAIL time.  Just retire Will go away.
I forgive you will. Even if no one in this unforgiving world will.
Un homme qui s’excuse est un grand homme. J’accepte tes excuses Will et je t’aime toujours. Merci
It just me or does the light behind his head keep making it look like he wearing a really tall hat
Wow. Will smith is definitely a better actor than Amber Heard 😂🤣🤣
Thank you for this. Very well put. Obviously the only person that can fully accept this is Chris, but personally I really admire you for doing this. We all make mistakes, but it is understanding when we’ve done wrong and rectifying them that makes us learn and a better person. X
We love you man!!!
Sir, this is a Pottery Barn…
Love is not the cure
Nope
We forgive you Mr Smith
Will Smith is an actor guys. This is an act. 3 months to post this? Boy bye
Thank you for sharing from your heart. ♥️I agree with many of the comments. We all make mistakes. Much peace to you, and your family.
Everyone makes mistakes. You are human. You have reflected and apologized. I hope you and he both heal and move forward. I hope the world understands. It may take time, but I believe you will overcome and everyone will move on. Do not get stuck in that moment.
i looooooooove meatballls
Everyone can make a mistake. Few people are capable to reconsider and apologize for. Shout out to you Will. You are a public person and your act right now it shows how we should’ve proceed when we messed up with things in our lives. Cheers!!!
Love Will all day everyday!!!!!
Hey man we all make mistakes and a lot will make much worse ones than that. Chill 👍 When Chris teaches out it'll be all good
The question, who is perfect? The answer, no one. Yes, there are actions that will left a profound mark in the life of a lot of people but, this was an unfortunate incident and sometimes people deserve a second chance. Will, hope you keep moving forward. Message from a humble person.
Everyone makes mistakes we all still love you will ❤️❤️
You forgot to say “I’m sorry” to Chris.
You just made me feel like no matter how old I get, I’ll never get away from Bullies, I honestly don’t see the point in living any longer, if people can do that and its just forgotten about, it makes me think, what a terrible world this truly is.
Who doesn’t want to forgive Will? He’s given us so many moments of laughter and joy, and it would be a pity to let a moment of madness discount it all.
Thank you Will...❤❤❤
Tbh ppl made it a big deal
Thank you Will. It was needed. Thank you.
It's good you apologized to Chris & his family. I hope Chris will forgive you & his family forgives you.
Hope you find peace and are forgiven,  hopefully this a lesson for others that just because you love someone shouldn't mean they dictate how you behave
It’s okay Will Smith. You’re fallible. I know some people that Wouldn’t have apologized. This behind you and move on.
An unruly woman will lead a kingdom to ruin
from those of us that are truly big fans of yours and your work...we got your back Will
This whole situation has been a teachable one. We all make mistakes. You're owning yours and that is exemplary.  Love and light ♥🙏
You're a human being. You're such an emotionally honest person, I most definitely have always respected you for that. We all make mistakes. Keep the faith, your heart is in the right place.
somewhere deep down in our hearts we still love you
Everyone makes mistakes. It's a lot of pressure to stand in your shoes and always do the right thing  I just pray for ur and everyone's healing and hope everyone can move on and be happy
We love you Will. Grace should be for everyone.
Your loved! You are not a disappointment you are human.
1:31 How many people got hurt in that momment. All Black people who know how to behave and conduct themselves appropriately!
TO WILL'S CENTRAL TRAUMA(be gone!) -  YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT! EVEN IF YOU DO, WE STILL LOVE YOU COZ WE KNOW YOUR HEART (nobody is perfect and you are a better human than most)  We love YOU like family and just like how nothing can separate us from the love of God, nothing will ever EVER stop us day 1's from having respect and love for you. You are Will Freaking Smith!   YOU HAVE ONLY BEEN ELEVATING EACH YEAR.   ONE MISTAKE HERE AND THERE AIN'T GONNA TAKE AWAY ALL THE GOOD YOU DID!
Young buck took a while to apologize
Hope you spoke to Jayden about their tweet "and that's how we do it."
Sorry to say this But Sorry isn't worth anything what happened is happened it's not gonna go away I love this man from my childhood and it took one incident to change my perception about him forever
Bro apologized 4 months late
We love you Will Smith ❤️
Thanks Will. That was very genuine . We love you❤️❤️❤️
Glad you're stepping forward now. The eye roll surely came with experience tho! Other than being extremely public, I'm still not sure it was fully the wrong decision. Others that aren't celebrities with high followings and profile, would react the same way for their loved ones after all.
It's about time!! 😂🤣 No seriously this was Well said and put together this was needed for everyone yes more needs to said and talked about but all parties involved have had an open conversation this is more than enough for anyone thats a fan or a hater  I've been a fan of Will Smith for 30+ years 90% of my life I'm 37 one embarrassing mistake would not and is not gonna change that I'm still in the process of reading your book but the more I read the more I realize that....you're human  Humans make errors in judgement  humans react wrongly Humans get emotionally vulnerable Etc etc  You're. only. human.  I honestly felt like you didn't let me down I didn't question my fandom of you after the incident nor should anybody who's followed and respected your work over the last 4 decades Cause that's not your heart  That's not who YOU are and the sooner you can get back to being who YOU are the better we'll all be  You're still the Fresh Prince
I accept his apology. He made a mistake; he's human. I am ready to move on.
Everyone makes mistakes, we're all imperfect beings! Good on you for acknowledging your mistake and apologizing for it. I feel like it's even more important that you took the time to reflect on your actions and look inside yourself before making a public apology. As the world waited to see your next move, you didn't apologize just because the world thought you should, or because you were feeling pressured, I feel it came from a genuine and sincere place! Respect!
Very disappointed in you Will. I grew up with you on my television. I usually don’t care about this chit in Hollywood but you went to far man. I’m sure you disappointed a lot of us. I can appreciate what you trying to do but damage has been done. Make it right, bro. 👍🏽
Hypocrite.
Glad to see that this may have a happy ending.  I think that was a sincere apology and Will's remorse for what he did was quite apparent.
We love you. So much respect for you brother.
Will, we love youuuuu! You made a mistake, but that mistake isn’t all that you are.
I'm so proud of him for making a much needed genuine apology into a corporate mandated and produced video. Lets goooo.
Too late
Big will 💪🏾⚡
We all going through, take care of yourself!
Very polished script from your expensive PR team
Big huggggssssss!
Took 5 months to apologizs
For ANYONE who's so quick to want to BANISH Will for the mistake, I hope for anything you do that others see as inexcusable, you're banished the same. Don't even bother asking for forgiveness because you don't deserve it.  You see how STUPID that sounds? Everyone who is genuinely seeking true forgiveness, and true growth from a situation should be allowed to move in said forward fashion.  That simple! Will has been damn near PERFECT his entire career, and has done far more good than your favorite celebrity, and probably more good than any of us ever would.  You're still one of my absolute favorites and there was never a reason for me to ever have to forgive you as you made a mistake. I've made plenty, so have we all. 🙏🏽

I think Chris already forgave him.
Still doesn’t say why he did it
I don't care
Thank you for this honest video ❤️
Too late junior
Ya ya but you still got about three fades waiting on you when you come back outside 😂😂😂😂
I still support you will! You are human, and you are owning up and understanding what you did was wrong. We all make mistakes. All of us. And I will always believe that Will is much more than this mistake. We are more than our mistakes. A lot of love ❤️
Thank you for stepping up and apologizing.
I’m glad he did this. I really am!
Will Smith entertained you but he is not your saviour
Good man ☮️
you can apologize to Chris’ mom, but just know that Parents Just Don’t Understand.
Will, I'm sorry that you had to sign up to do it in the first place. This industry is just...well if you know, you know. 👁😔
This is the way you apologise. Well done.
I NEVER comment on stuff like this, but this is so empty. No one who is truly sorry needs to control the narrative like this. Motivations around this I can't speculate on, but I feel this is far from a heartfelt apology to anyone.
I want to like this because Will didn't need to make it, but I'm also concerned if it becomes too popular or is received too well then his human deodorant stick is going to make a Red Table where its all somehow about herself
How does this affect Lebron's legacy?
Ya still won't be interested in any more movies you do. Looked up to you Fresh Prince . But looks like your wallet took over whom you are and the roots you made over the year's...  Yeah I'm a complete nobody far from wealthy.  As I grind hours on a clock to pay and watch you . I can't un see your TRUE self. Maybe over time my views will change.  This video shows he has to post online his apology. How many views and likes makes more $$..
I've loved you before and I love you after. All these bandwagon people that have so many negative things to say "after the fact" can kick rocks. I've been following your story and listening to you speak for years. Your journey is amazing, inspiring, and educational even. I knew you were remorseful and this day would come. You're an amazing person, not only because of your talent, charm, and greatness but because you are humble, loving, and YOU ARE DOING THE WORK! Mistakes through confronting our demons is apart of THE WORK process. Yes, we are all human and if we all did our own self work the world would be a better place. Thank you for being another great example of what we as people can achieve. Sincerely, a true fan💪❤💯
Apology accepted although some people will hold you in contempt forever because they don't have the grace to forgive. 🤍
This is just a dude trying to save his career.  Any other workplace and you would have similar harsh consequences.
No need to apologize will
This should have been done the next day, or even on the same night but let's face it - the incident shouldn't have happened in the first place. A great actor but terrible behaviour. It feels as if this is just an attempt to rescue some of the lost repution , but having said that, we all deserve forgiveness and a second chance.
We all make mistakes.
You can just hear the PR people in the background, "Will, that sounds just a little bit disingenuous, lets try it again, using the words 'central trauma'".  You have enough money to last the rest of your life, and set up your kids. Sadly you're as over as Bill Cosby, so just go away.  Chris isn't going to be calling, he's too busy working.
We all make mistakes. Trying to be better and learn from it. That's what is important.  Hopefully they all can be friends again 1 day and grow 🙏🏾
dude is literally reading a script LMAO
I agree wit Dave Chappelle Mr. Smith "dont put the mask back on" we still love you
At least he didn't come out crying, in a grey sweater with poor quality apology video. Like every other youtuber
Just red mist moment. It happens. Hope you and Chris can reconcile. You are legends of the game. Please make it happen.
Actions always speak louder than words. This action with these words is a good start.
Love you will!!!! Never lost any respect for you
STAGED.
I love Will Smith, I’m 37 years old and I have loved him and been entertained by him since Fresh Prince. He’s a part of my childhood and beyond. I always respected him, but especially in recent years when he’s shared so much of his personal journey and personal development. I was so disappointed and shocked at his actions and his behaviour afterwards. I thought better of him and he is wiser than this. And on the same night he was nominated for the first time for this honour and won. I’m still entertained by him, I respect that he finally spoke about it, but it does change how I see him personally. I will, however, be watching MIB tonight and I’ll be enjoying it as much as I always do 🙏🏻
He who is without sin, cast the first stone.  takes alot to offer your entire self in an apology for your worst moment.  regardless of who judges this as genuine, you've done everything to handle the situation correctly after the fact and promote healing.  this is a great example of selfless love after making a human error.  My hope is that your worst moment sheds the most light. it's up to Chris to complete the circle. what a powerful display of forgiveness that would be.
There’s no sin too great for God to forgive. The only way to be free from guilt and shame is to ask Jesus for forgiveness and to accept it from Him.
🥺🥺😭😭♥️♥️ I love you maan, we all make mistakes. I hope Chris will forgive one day. Another thing,  I finally got your memoir 🤸😍🥰😘♥️♥️
Seems negative comments are deleted
The most INSINCERE non-apology in the history of mankind. No mention of how OTHERS felt. No mention of the pain Smith caused. Marginal words to get out the "Ok, we covered Chris's mom, and we covered Chris's brother." But not ONE SINGLE MENTION of Smith's even thinking about the pain he caused THEM! Not one! Apology NOT ACCEPTED!
Time heals.  Those who are your friends still after will be your best friends forever!
Yayyy! I am right now watching Spies in Disguise and laughing my head off!
I was once told that saying 'I apologise' is not the same as saying 'I'm sorry'
we all make mistakes. We're all human. And you taking accountability is all that matters. You overshadowed everyones night that night , you embarrassed that man in-front of millions of people as well as his family. I hope you find inner peace and heal from this
Thanks Will. You are loved and you are forgiven. I know that wasn't you. Take all the time you need for you to be healthy mentally. I'm sure once Chris has his space you'll be back friends in time. I was sooo upset at first because you're a black man that influences the world and I know that alone is a great commitment  but you'll be greater from this. My prayers are with you and your family🙏🏽
Good for you, awesome display of humility, respect for others and awareness of the larger context re: others who may have been  affected.  Also glad you see how corrosive self-shame and rumination is.  You will have haters who will pick this apart but you know better than to absorb a nano-second of armchair quarterbacking ankle biters.  Proud of you man, safe travels in this journey. Paul Sanders, LMFT
4 months too late, but very well spoken and great questions to answer. I was off the boat until now, hopping back on to watch your progress. Thank you Will.
Much Love Unc Will! We ALL fall short but God forgives and we can follow his example and forgive as well.  Hopefully Chris can one day too. Jesus loves you fam. We love you! Walk in freedom now OG!
Lmao
We're all human and we've all made big mistakes and will continue to do so, it's part of this journey called life. The good thing is that you've acknowledged your mistake and you're trying to make amends. I hope that all parties involved will be able to heal and move on from this.
💖🙏Glad your back. And let's put all this behind us we're all human , we've done stuff that we're not proud of but yet God still forgives us and loves us. Everything will be ok God knows your heart.. Welcome back Will Smith
Never be ashamed, you’re a good person that made a mistake due to normal emotions! 🖤 You acknowledged your mess up and even apologized for it. That’s all you can do, now pick back up and move forward 🤷🏽‍♀️
Real one… Apologized, requested open dialogue.   When it happens it happens.  If it doesn’t, either way we all move on.  Still love ya Will.  #philly all day ❤️
Up on the high horse, down parring together. I feel with You, ´cause I am you too. We have a LOT of work <3
Stay up bro !
This is your best acting yet.
It’s rewind time!
Nobody’s perfect, and there’s no strength in division.
It takes a real man or woman to recognize their wrong doing, and apologize sincerely from the soul... and Will Smith did just that. Hopefully one day Will and Chris by themselves can have a sit down and talk from the heart, and fully resolve all the variables.
It shows that you are human and we all make mistakes!
Ay Will... mi familia y yo te queremos, respetamos y admiramos desde hace muchísimo tiempo, y puedo decirte que ese cariño, ese respeto y esa admiración no se han ido a ningún lado, no nos has decepcionado, eres humano, estas cosas pasan y hay que seguir adelante; ya ofreciste disculpas sinceras, qué más puede hacerse? espero de corazón que la parte afectada pueda perdonar, espero que pronto puedan reunirse, tal vez haya algo que salvar de esa relación . Lamento mucho que tu gran noche en los Óscares se haya visto opacada por este episodio, pero tienes una muy exitosa carrera que te respalda y toda una vida de trabajo y disciplina que no desaparece por esto. Toca seguir adelante
Keep working on you Big homie. Continue heal your mental state. I pray that you and Chris can make peace among men. Blessings to your health may it continue to get better over time. Still a fan bruh. God got you🙏🏾💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾😎
We still rocking with you, Will. There is grace and you are human. Keep looking after your heart and your supporters will be here. You’re the number one priority in your own revelations and healings. Proud of you, Will Smith! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
God bless Will & Chris.
The Pursuit of Forgiveness.
I guess it was not his Will.. 😀
Proud of him for trying to make everything right and apologizing  I will always look up to him and respect him
We love you, will💓
Will, just let go!  It’s amazing that you’ve been able to carry your squeaky image for over 30 years without a miss. This incident proves that it is entirely too heavy now. So disappoint us in small ways the way we all do because we are human so you won’t disappoint yourself and your family in such a big way again.  I promise we will continue to be here to support everything you do.  But please be you and eff the image.
Well done buddy. I promise you 98% of the people criticizing you, aren't as accountable as you. We're humans. We all make mistakes. It truly grinds my gears that people have higher expectations of others than they have of themselves. And those FEW people who Have reached that higher level will Never Look Down on you, coz they Get how things works. Keep your head up Will. I BELIEVE IN YOU. You will ALWAYS be an ABSOLUTE LEGEND in my eyes. A HUMAN ONE. But a GOAT nonetheless. Your contributions FAR outweigh your sins. Take All the time you need, your LOYAL (non-fickle) fans will be waiting to  celebrate your return. Im sure whatever you do will be as exciting, fascinating and interesting as you've Always been.
Top G
Everyone makes mistakes that they are not proud. Life goes on!!
Philadelphia brother phukkk bull he deserved it move on and get money
Well said Mr. Smith. We all make mistakes and correcting them are never easy. I think most of us understand this.
Absolutely Proud of You, Mr. Smith. Much respect...Many Blessing...Love you more!
I still love you. No worries! No judgment from me. Who can say they haven’t messed up before!?! Whomever is not for you now, never was! 🤗
Will proud of ya! We are all human..we all fall.. it's what you do to get back up. It must have been hard to do this because Will may be right for being mad about something legit, but as he said, the way he handled it was not ok, which is what he is addressing without trying to talk about why. This is a real apology for the act and not the reason. Love how he is taking ownership without demeaning his reason.
Will, I just hope you don't regret trying to make something work, some relationships just come to a natural end and there's nothing you can do about, trying to force something like that just makes things worse.  God bless anyway.
It’s disappointing that this took so long for you to apologize.😤
Meh..I'll accept. It reads as sincere...for the most part
We love and appreciate you Will. You’re human and have flaws like everyone else. Remember to find some grace for yourself and take it easy. Life isn’t perfect we aren’t expecting you to be. ❤️
... who has never sin, throw the first stone ..... we all are just humans
Nope.
Humans make mistakes. And humans on a public stage make public mistakes. If you put in the work, that’s all that matters.
We all make mistakes. We all get angry and do things we regret later. We all are human beings with emotions and sometimes your emotions get the best of you. I had situations that made say things i didn't mean but emotions got the best of me. Now i have learn to deal with my anger and control it. Its hard to hold back sometimes but Will is a human like everyone else and we still love him for being Will.
All this for a woman who won't even sleep with you anymore LOL
Unsubbed, so obvious the comments are being severely moderated here
We appreciate you, Will!
Will you have to admit it was very shocking we were all just so disappointed I started to read your book I no longer can do it hopefully I can get on your bandwagon again
❤️
We all make mistakes, and Will seems genuine. He's also fortunate that Chris is one cool MF... because 95% of people in his position would have lawyered up HARD. Wish them both well in the future.
As someone who was personally there, I can confirm this's exactly how it looked. Technology & all.
As someone who was personally there, I can confirm this's exactly how it looked. Technology & all.
Good god...His acting skillz are still on point.
Thank you Will. This apology matters and... just thank you. That is all.
Not gonna praise you yet but this is the first step...people do make mistakes, and people pay the consequences, that's life, keep heading in the right direction and this could be a real redemption arc
One time action doestt define you, you are a great guy everybody have issues in his life and you dont Need to prove nothing to us keep doing your excelent job like so far you been doing we Love you will greetings from México
You are disgusting WILL SMITH! You should be ashamed of yourself. You can’t just ask for an apology over a video when you causes so much pain to Chris. You humiliated him in front of the whole world. That is unforgivable.
Need to do it in person
nope
Quickest 5 minutes and 44 seconds of my life
Much respect Will!
Then I’m hanging on then Will!
Sorry to your kids.. 🤣🤣. “That’s how we do” was the first thing your son tweeted. Sounds like he needs to apologize too..
Almost all damages are repairable and the one you caused that night is not one of them.  Not until Chris forgives you, there won't be any change to the situation.  Peace
I can respect this man. Takes balls to admit you're wrong and be a better version of yourself. Will, you get my respects. Now just bear fruits of repentance and I'm sure your fans and others will give you a second chance. If Mike Tyson could do it, you can also.
Will, we all make mistakes. I was shocked at the time to be honest with you. I would reach out to Oprah and ask Chris to come on. I feel like talking to Oprah with Chris is the way to go.
and why are so many people saying "it must have been difficult to apologise" that should be the easy part, he wasn't the victim.
One of the most sincerest apologies that I have seen.. I know what it means when you're at a moment of vulnerability or when you harbour things/demons inside you that you don't want people to see... I have been there and I have done things that when I look back, I totally regret. Take time to heal Will.. Noone is perfect and Don't beat yourself about it.. I hope that Chris and his family have the heart to forgive him because this can happen to anyone.. Peace!✌️🕊️🇰🇪
Will tou até a big Man! We andrestand that moment. You deserve all the respect and support at this time too. We here in Brazil love you. Be well and return to the big screen soon.
You are a human being Will you can't be hard on yourself of letting people down, You stumbled too  You have been my biggest fan for so long, And that hasn't change till to date  We all make mistakes hope Chris can reach out back and sort this matter, Sorry Chris hope you can forgive him  #Forgive
Just leave it alone after this Will.
Good for you will. Being a man and owning up to it. People in your position have done far worse and the fans should move on with love. Past is in the past. What you do now is important
Even the best of people make terrible decisions, I can’t comprehend how much pressure someone like Will Smith deals with everyday with the amount of fame he has. I’m glad he’s facing this head on, it would’ve been easy to keep working and never acknowledge it
We love you will!!
Uh oh, millionaire realizes he ended his career in shame and cant buy back his dignity.
You can apologize all you want now, but the damage is already done.
An amazing individual and your genuine feelings are always portrayed. I’m glad you are self reflecting and the remorse shows . Take your time and the world will always be here for you as you deserve to spread light and love 💕 as long as you continually own up to your faults and acknowledge that you are only human making mistakes is ok and I hope you and Chris work it out ! Love you will !
You're just a human being who has made a mistake. And instead of putting your head in the ground or trying to escape from this situation you step up and say you're sorry. Claps for you my birthday twin 💛💙
That was a very honest and respectful apology video I’m with you all the way will
Great job Will 👍🏾
We all learn from our mistakes.   Let's lay the first brick as perfectly as we can, then make sure we try to lay the next brick perfectly and then before we know it we've built a wall. Don't go out and say you'll build the biggest or best wall. Lay that first brick.  We still stand by you.
Complete your penance Will, do a roast.
He's just a thug. Next.
As an editor, this has far too many cuts in it. I’m not PR but this should have been made to feel like a single moment and not a apology music video.
You are done with me. No more movies no more fan page no more. Your mistakes will cost you WILL. Because you hurt that guy for ever and you did not deserve to be honored. Perood
We forgive you. We love you and we are still cheering for you. Keep pushing forward!!
KEYWORDS: 'Disrespect or insults', 'history with Chris', 'nuances and complexities'
For 30 years Will Smith had a "nice guy" reputation. He destroyed that reputation in 30 seconds.
Bro I was dissapointed.  But you are Human and you deserve forgiveness man... The fact that you are up here doing this is a big step... I honestly hope it all works out for you
I still love you no matter what. ❤️🥰
I haven’t lost my faith in you. You are human and things happen. Keep working on you and take time for yourself to heal. Your great and I’m ready for more from Big Willy Smith
Will, I definitely felt some kinda way because, I could not believe what I was seeing.  It hurt me for several days after it happened.  Thank you for taking the time you needed to process all of this.  I believe every word you said in this video and I believe it is a very heartfelt apology.  I know that you and Chris are phenomenal in your own right and I am praying and I believe that the two of you will talk about it and work it out.  We ✊🏾 have to have each other’s back!! God Bless You and I believe I will see a very genuine and truthful moment(s) between you and Chris in the very near future!!! 🤎🖤🤎🖤 🙏🏾
Big Willy 🕴🏻
I think its apparent that some good counselling and/or therapy has led up to this point. Brother, you haven't erred in a way that's inexcusable and you're trying to recover in the right way, that atones for your mistake and seeks out the growth and the lesson. Don't give up. Keep yourself and Chris focused in the healing efforts. You'll get through this.
In my opinion when someone says "I apologize" they don't really mean it. "I'm sorry" is how you apologize. I don't believe this interview is sincere.
U were tired...apologizing...is grown...  #salute
Seems like he filmed this on a BlackMagic 6k Pro camera.....good quality
I forgive you King. We all fall short of the glory sometimes. This authentic apology is all you can do. Let the universe handle the rest.  We need a voice like yours in this generation. Stay Strong! I look forward to your next project.  💪🏽
KMWNOYFM
Mr Smith, thank u for doing this recording. Keep doing what ur doing and just heal. We are not perfect, no one is. I have loved ur movies and shows since I was little. Thats not going to change... you have sooo many fans that want u to come back better and we are all looking forward to your next projects. Blessings to you and your family. (Keep ur head up 🤗)
All I can say is I have made those mistakes and I had to decide that I needed so seek peace and pursue it. And Im happy you are doing that. We all need grace. We all make mistakes. We all learn from our mistakes failures. I just pray you respond to Jesus and go back to your first love.
I’ll accept that. We are all on our own journey and I hope you’re able to continue to work on yourself and understand where your true strength comes from. Unfortunately, it took something shocking to help you realize it’s time to reevaluate... But I am glad you are taking those steps now. This might be the worst point in your life, but when you look back… it might be the biggest turning point as well. Keep working hard, man.
WELL SAID!
I wish you had also apologised for how you partied afterwards like nothing had happened. You should have been mature enough to understand 2 hours later the mistake you had made.  But I appreciate the “no excuse” apology, and you’re right we’re human and we make mistakes and then we learn and grow from them. Good luck on the journey ahead.
MK Ultra did it
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Get your mind right.... Everything else will fall in line. Can't make anyone do something they aren't ready to do. Thanks for taking accountability.
Another nigga apologizing
Forfeit your award, as a way to show you are truly sorry.  Otherwise, just words.  I refuse to watch any of Will Smith's movies or shows.  Action speaks louder than words.
🎻
Reason why I respect Will Smith more will you are my greatest inspiration love you 💜
Will, I love you and your Heart.  We live in a world where there are so many "Grown" people (including many celebrities) who halfway apologize or Make Excuses for making a Huge Mistake!! You Owned Your Mistake, Never Made Excuses and sincerely apologized with a Pure Heart and Good Intentions!! Bravo to you. I pray that you and Chris can someday come together and recover your relationship. This made me cry Tears of Joy because I honestly believe You are Genuine!! God Bless You. Praying for your Healing also!!❤❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This is a step forward. I’m still disappointed and hurt but that’s just that the fresh prince has been my hero my entire life. My hero cause you’re not that guy but we all have bad days. Just it was a colleague or friend, you both worked with Chris for years.   But this is definitely hope I’m happy to see. Still a huge inspiration to the father that I am.
You are an amazing person Will, your mistakes don't define you. We all are humans and must of us in your position would do same if our loved one was being disrespected by another person. I hope you and Chris get to talk and make peace I love and respect you sir.
took u like 5 months
Hack: speed up video 2x
Nice acting, Will!
Hows Jadas boy toys
Will, hope you read this comment. First I'm happy to see you back amongst the people but take your time during your journey back and don't feed into negativity. Second I can feel from your speech that what you have said is genuine. I can see the emotions  in your face from each words, and also I can see the depression in your eyes. I know how it is to want to make everyone happy and not have people disappointed in you. That's part of the depression I pray for you to continue on getting the help from the therapist. I wish I could set down talk to you and try to help you. Stay strong in your mind and soul. Stay true keep praying and meditating to God and asking him for his guidance. You will always be family we still love you. Keep this in mind sometimes if you set back and observe your surroundings and just listen God put people in your path (life) just for a little while but then He will tell you to move on from them too. To keep your mind and soul strong. Keep The Faith Love You.
Still got nothing but love you Will. (And well said, honest, and transparent responses) Thanks for sharing. Stay strong! 🫶✊
still the softest rapper alive
Go away Edit- that was harsh. Everyone makes mistakes
not long enough
massive respect
it takes years to build a reputation... and only minutes to destroy it.
No no. U r were right over 100%. U have nothing reason for appologize. U did, what u have to. At this moment u did, what must to do every man for protect his woman and familly. Respect u Will. U are really man. Russian ppl loves u and respect u. Chris was wrong!
You are forgiven, we still have your back. 💛
Will never look at you the same! You are only sorry Bc of the backlash! Why did it take you 3 months to be sincere?
Your behaviour was unacceptable but it takes a lot of courage to admit it publicly. Forgiveness is the only answer to this situation😭
He may realize now that it wasn't the right way to handle the situation but I'm curious if still rationalizes his actions to himself or others because not doing that is the true sign of remorse. You can't say "that was a bad way to handle it but.....he had it coming". That is not remorse.
3 months and this is the best your PR team could come up with? Some narcissistic rant.... Sure good on ya for apologizing but was it really necessary to talk about yourself so much?   Glad to see you off your high horse but it's going to take a lot more than this for you to climb back on up there.
You should go to church, maybe there you can find peace. Social media will never forgive you.
None of us are  perfect. Only Jesus! We  forgive  each other and forgive ourselves for healing❤
Just apologizing because of business. Money matters the most.
You are an amazing person Will, your mistakes don't define you. We all are humans and must of us in your position would do same if our loved one was being disrespected by another person. I hope you and Chris get to talk and make peace I love and respect you sir.
It’s all good will we forgive you✊🏾
one thing about me... i'm always going to love and support will smith!! it was a low point, and i hope that everyone who was hurt can at least open up that conversation with you. i know it's not easy.
It’s aight will you’ll be aight.
As far as apologies for that's a good one but most of that was aimed at everyone except Chris in fact he still didn't say on video I'm sorry Chris in fact he said I apologized to Chris
He disrespected you. I do not blame you for what you did. I still believe in you and want you back on youtube.
It's time for the red pill 💊
Takes a man to apologize like this. Much respect.
This is going to trend at number 1 Watch what tell y'all 🙄
"It's been a minute..."  Hood/thug English.
Will, you gotta give it a year or so for this to pass.    Myself, it was hard to look at you as an inspiration anymore.   Any old videos where you were leading by example and speaking light into existence were hard to watch.   You have to take time for yourself and step away for your own good.   Reassess and re-engage.
Em nenhum momento eu achei que você cometeu algum erro. Vc defendeu sua esposa de ficar sendo ridicularizada perante a várias pessoas. O Chris errou ao brincar com uma situação que não cabe brincadeira. Assim como a mãe e o irmão do Chris se magoaram , os seus filhos também se magoaram com as ofensas em tom de "brincadeira" que sua esposa sofreu. Parabéns pela sua atitude,  vc honrou a sua esposa e toda a sua família ❤️
I think you'd have to be intentionally cynical and seeking drama If you look at Will Smith and think he's being disingenuous over his remorse for his action.  The guy absolutely made the wrong choice that night and did something awful and yet he's also just taking responsibility for it and accepting the consequences.  Not much more we can ask of someone.
I hope your healing ❤️‍🩹🙏🏽
I saw in that very moment how you talked about your wrestling  with yourself, choices, and the many past trauma come into play from your book.   Remember the things your grandmother shared with you.  It will carry you through a lifetime. Remain strong and vigilant! We make terrible mistakes everyday.  It just so happens yours was in front of others.  As Donnie McClurkin would say "We fall down, we get up!" It's time to get back up again. Be the best version of yourself, never live in the past! Learn from it! Be encouraged and always wear your grandmother words of wisdom around your neck and your mother's advice on your face.
Well said and done Will. The public can pound sand, you said what you felt you needed to say to the parties involved. Much respect. Blessings and peace to you
Will, I forgive you bro.  Of all the celebrities I still can’t believe ‘you’ did that but we should put no one on a pedestal.  We’re all sinners and all fail.  We all need grace.  I’m proud of you from this point forward knowing you are working to be a better person as we all should strive to do.  Love ya man
Too little too late.. should of had more WILL power.  🤡 you started a trend that will be with us for generations.
Hey man, I know you this won't reach you but I want to know if you are okay.
Will estoy orgullosa de ti y entiendo que no manejaste bien tus emociones y que no era la manera correcta de manejarlo, pero no tienes que disculparte por defender a tu familia de un agresor psicológico, que lo estaba haciendo frente a miles de personas en el mundo.  Mucha fuerza, amor, felicidad, entendimiento y sabiduría.
Been a fan yours literally my entire life. Been a fan of chirs as well. We all make mistakes. No is perfect. It takes courage to stand front and center and admit that a mistake was made and to apologize for it. The road will be long and difficult, but at the end of it, I believe the light will shine down on you again. Keep moving forward ✊🏽✊🏽
❤️
Ok, yeah, "there's no part of you that thinks that", "not the optimal way to handle", alright, all good. I agree with you. (maybe. lol)  But what is the right way, then??? Really? You're not gonna cover how you SHOULD'VE acted?
Sometimes people forget famous actors can make mistakes, they think you are all robots, judge all actions worst than any police, and punished them publicly, hard, cuz is soooo easy to write a comment online. This world lack of compassion.  Keep on going Will, you got it.  Dust yourself up and try again! (8)
Thank you for your vulnerability
I'm living with my own demons and I respect anyone that it trying to come out of a dark place while at the same time accept responsibility for what they have done.
We  all are humans and Perfectly Imperfect.
We all make mistakes but it takes courage and humility to admit when you are wrong. All the best Will.
We’re all human beings even celebrities we all make mistakes he apologized and hopefully learn from that horrible decision we still have luv for you will 💕
We are all human and prone to making mistakes. We still love you! Hopefully Chris will come around, on his own time, and be open to discussing everything with you.
Very well spoken and thoughtful… “I am trying to be remorseful without being ashamed…”
RESPECT !
I just love you anyway man😍
I'm here for you big boss. Always been a big fan always will be
Goofy ahh
Will don’t apologize anymore. We still love you. We understand you. There’s no need to continue this. He doesn’t want to talk cause he wants to profit off it. Just let it be.
Weirdo
3 months to late. But a solid apology.
Regardless of what happen I love you both praying for both of you. 🙏
Fake asf
I mean the dude has been under so much pressure to live up to expectations since he was a teenager. Everything he does is an attempt to measure up, to be perfect.  As a teen star , as an actor , family man, celebrity , role model , husband.   He made a mistake.  Now it’s about reflecting and moving forward and learning from it.
This is amazing. It is difficult to admit when wrong; apologize when you know it might not be enough; and be vulnerable and honest. I love it. I hope you continue to heal.❤️
I think he just forgot that he's Will Smith and became Mike Lowrey at that moment. You're my favourite actor and I know that you're a good man. Everything will be fine!
Typical Actor. Please don't trust someone reading a script for a apology.
Nobody's perfect....
"Light.  Love."  Blah blah blah in to the world.  "Be friends again..."    "Remorseful without being shameful"?     Sounds like hubris.  Look it up.
Will Hold Your Head Up & Keep Moving Forward! You Human Mane ...You Made A Mistake, Stop Overthinking & Down Talking Ya Self. Take Back Control Of Your Life.
This is unrehearsed apology which is good well darn well well done just don’t do it again
O que fazer? se reinventar de fato? ler Nietzsche, fazer um curso de psicologia, de filosofia?
Dude’s a good actor. This was a good performance. He should get nominated for this.
Felt genuine. Felt honest. Felt raw. People make mistakes, celebrities mistakes can be thrown under a microscope under another microscope under a telescope and then blown out of proportion for stupid sht like oh he didn't exhale correcty so he doesn't mean it. Bottom line is, how does Chris feel. And then how you react, to how Chris feels.
Yes
You’re so brave. Most people don’t have the courage to apologize privately let alone publicly.  If you think you’re a piece of s*~t, you probably need more therapy though 💜
We still love you will …. Your lucky we love you more than chris and it wasnt someone else you smacked like dave chappel or kevin hart than youd be out of here budy😂
Welcome back, Will. I am rooting for you. 😊
I respect him just outright acknowledging he messed up and saying that sorry isn’t sufficient.  The framed poster in the back about love seems a bit intentional and disingenuous, but hey… the man is human and he’s trying to find a way to move on.
Who am I not to forgive a man who says I AM SORRY,when Christ forgave me!
I’m proud Will was able to humble himself and apologize to not just Chris but also to his family. I’m sure we’ve all put ourselves in situations where we’ve made ourselves look bad or that we’re not proud of. The one thing I will say is that I pray Will can forgive himself and reclaim his peace.
You fucked up will i will never watch tv again
proud of you will.
I felt his apology and it’s not rehearse apology which  makes more believable and sincere apology it was.
Your human, even the greatest make mistakes but even impressed that you took the time to apologise more after digesting the situation. Unfortunately you allowed your emotions to get the best of you at the time and sure you will do better take care.   I'm sure you don't need to be told that you still need to try and live your best life.
Your son sure thought that was right
you haven't gone full YouTuber until you post an appology video.
You are a grown man,you knew very well what you did at that time,you had no drugs,no alcohol...so this,love,light and joy you can keep that bullshit to yourself...
speak normally without the forced "i'm bad" accentuation
Dawg you gotta stop taking Ls 💀💀
3 months too late.
Will Smith I watch you every morning on The Fresh Prince, you continue to make me laugh, we all Perfectly Imperfect, it takes a big person to apologize. I still love watching you.🙏
A man has to Apologize when wrong Kudos to you🤗👍👍👍👍🆗
we still love you Will
Be ashamed of yourself. We don’t forgive you. This is like jadas birthday. This is narcissistical and self serving. Go away for longer
MORE FINISHED THAN PENALDO
Ain't nobody perfect...... we've all made mistakes.
I think we all make obviously mistakes and let our emotions get the best of us so it’s okay
Will Smith is a professional, world class actor. It's impossible to know if he's being sincere or not.
It's too late. Apparently these apologies are for personal benefit (they are not real).   P.s.: Physiologically, one day is enough to sober up and the next morning to come to a conclusion.
Respect
I am glad he issued this apology. To all of the people who were saying his actions were justified…what do you think of this?
Save it. No one cares what you feel or think.
I'm not buying it but love how he dives straight into the important questions even if I don't agree with the answers.
I believe every word you said. You are a flawed human just like all of us. Yet you are an emotional leader of your time. This is your journey, and you will prevail.
This is exactly why I love Jesus. God is the only one who has the power to forgive me and make me a new creation in Christ Jesus. Once that happens, everyone else’s opinions fade out of view.
Words words words. There is no excuse for what you did. You need to own it. Really know that it was you.  My first reaction to it was I said " wow surely will is an intelligent man why did he not use words? " You could have smashed him in the face with a great comeback! But in the heat of the moment blah blah.  I with most of the comments here in that I hope you can recover from this and most of all learn from it too.
Where do I get that Polo he's wearing? Need
/tv/
The words were spot on the smiling & what appeared to be holding back the laughter came off as disrespectful & the fact it took 3 months to even get this out is appalling at this point I feel the only reason for this is your opportunities dried up & you are looking for a way to get some of them back.
I am more impressed by the multicam setup in this apology video.
Mr Smith I think it's high time you stopped worrying about other people.  How about you start thinking about yourself for a change.  Your children are old enough now start making Will happy. You'll be amazed how other things will fall into place. May you start to heal. And try to get a good night sleep.  Y.N.W.A.
Still too proud to humbly admit he acted like a POS and accept the shame that goes with it.
U didn’t let me down but I’m glad your a man and confronts the hard questions !
Thank you Will.  I was surprised at how bothered I was by this incident and it took me "a minute" to understand why.  I appreciate you taking the time to process the events so you could be authentic at the right time as opposed to scripted and reactive.  Kudos to you and I wish you only the best...
You left it all this time to publicly apologise? Is this a genuine apology or because you have a film coming out?
will smith is also a human like us❤❤💯We love you will
We were concerned for Will and Chris. I hope there is forgiveness, owning up,  not just publishing, and moving forward. There can be some trepidation in waking. It's time! Love yall.
I Will always be a fan. You messed up, you owned it and now you and us can move on.
Don’t worry man. You are the best!
You made a mistake. EVERYBODY HAS MADE A MISTAKE. Problem is EVERYBODY THINK THEY SH×T SMELL LIKE ROSES. Let someone televise our lives and let's see how many mistakes are magnified, whether big or small. He is taking accountability and that's what matters. Will this really the first time in your 20 plus year career that you have made a mistake so don't beat yourself up and don't sit in it. I am still a Hugh fan.
Respect😇
Thanks for the apology.  Hopefully Chris will work it out with you. Question:  How much does it cost to hire a PR firm to fix your behavior?  is there a comment limit.  Does it say we are providing 5,000 positive comments.
I’m sorry I feel you deserve everything that’s happening to you, you set us back with your actions my man
Will we all make mistakes
His delivery, expression of sincerity and raw feelings couldn’t of been more genuine. Well said Will! We live and we learn
To me… Will Smith is still “The Fresh Prince”…
🙌🏾🙌🏾  Proud of you Will!
Un verdadero PLANCHABRAGAS que, teniéndolo todo (físico, dinero, éxito profesional, salud, etc.), se dejó agarrar de los huevos por la típica dominatrix.
Salute to you sir. Accountability is the 1st step.
Your still banned … a career wasted all over a woman who brags about sleeping with other men …….
We all make mistakes. Some of our mistakes are in private while others, like yours, are in public. Regardless, our mistakes should be used as a lesson to not make them again. May God bless you and may God heal and bless Chris. I hope one day, you both will be able to sit together and share with the world how you’ve overcome this moment. I am still and have not stop being a fan. Peace, Love and Much respect.
it is always a good reminder that one misstep can change the trajectory of our lives. In one sense this was a minor act that got big because of his position.  a big act would be drunk driving that resulted in a death and spending time behind bars.  it's always good to be mindful of what the possible results of said action could be and try to avoid unnecessary negative outcomes. Since we all make mistakes the important thing to remember is to forgive if we want forgiveness for our missteps.
I still love you man
10 seconds shouldn’t out do 10+ years of work. Glad u learned Will, bounce back my bro!
This sounds scripted…
Forgiven people, forgive people. I am a fan of both Chris and Will. I have been waiting to hear from you Will, I am a fan from South Africa and you are human and you made a mistake and your apology is accepted bruh. The only way you can go is up from here 💙 Focus on your focus #BishopTDJakes
The moderators must be working overtime, not a single negative comment 😂
Today's the first day of the rest of you life! ❤❤❤ #BETHEGOOD💞🍃💞
You good man. Keep moving forward.
I am not a huge Smith fan. However, I think an honest apology deserves forgiveness. I hope Chris’ does it. He wasn’t a very nice person neither.
Fake
People make mistakes. I didn't think any differently of him after it happened than I did before it happened. He owned up to it, apologized, and tried to make amends to his ability. Time to move on.
this is what happened when you married to wrong person
This is a very sincere and honest apology from Will, i really believe he's very remorseful! 👍
That last part was beautiful.  . Friendship is the ultimate goal. The world needs friendships. Light and love to you.
Love and blessings! Peace and love are priority. You apologized. Forgive yourself. Move forward. Thank you for sharing💕
We never expected you to be perfect.  We love you and we know you’re sorry.  You’re no worse than the rest of us.  Let’s peace this situation up and get passed it 🙏🏾
We love you Will. We forgive you.
We love you Fresh Prince! You human AF. We got yo back brother ♥️
The apology means something because it didn't come with excuses for the behavior. And that is all that anyone asked of you. Your actions sucked. You know this, we all know this. But we all make mistakes. We all have moments we wish we could take back. We all can recall moments that weren't our finest hour. So, as a long time fan, I can accept your apology and move on. I'm sure in time, Chris will do the same. In a world with so much going on, this incident is the least of anyone's concerns. Continue the work. People will see it and they will appreciate it. We all love a good comeback story!
I grew up listening to your music and always thought you were a good dude.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Takes a big person to come out and apologize like this.  I hope everything works out for you.
💜
We still love you Will! One mistake does not define anyone.
Respect to you Will Smith. I have faith you will make good things happen in your life and the life of others after all of this. Be gentle on yourself.
Will, I am glad you took the time out to think about what happened...a lot of people do things and they don't think rationally before, during, or after they do it. We all are works in progress, and I know if you could take it back, you would. Heavy is the head that wears the crown...it's not easy living your life under a microscope for all to see, and then you have to deal with the criticism from strangers about what you did...I hope that you and Chris can mend your friendship, but if nothing else, I hope you can forgive YOURSELF.
"Get out there and make it dam well clear that you did this by yourself and that I wasnt involved"  Apparently said no one ever
Will you’re still a man. Your woman was disrespected multiple times on live TV. I understand why you did it
You look very very honest ….that’s what is important, comes from the heart ……we all human being, at the end of the day ….  Hopefully, Chris see this video and try overcome from it, like I said , we all human beings, and if you’re willing to sorry and to talk about it, that’s what matters at this moment   Blessings Will
I have read Will's book multiple times now. Anyone who has, knows that was a moment of heated reaction. No man deserves to be forgiven more than Will Smith.  We love you, Will.  So glad to see your face again.
You should not have handled the situation that way! You can say you apologize and we believe you but sometime it takes awhile for some to understand and forgive the action!
i really dont think what he did was all that bad for this to be that big of a deal, like there's a lot of people out there trying to take peoples civil rights and be proud of it, that interrupting an award by punching someone who was being disrespectful, although is incovenient and in bad taste, is not the worst thing someone could do
Remember you are only human. At the same respect you are in the public eye. Remember you are allowed to make mistakes.  Remember a man always protects his family and reputation sometimes no matter the cost. Remember who ran there mouth before the incident.  I ain't never been mad at you for what happened. The sun still shines tomorrow.
It's OKAY! You are human. We love you & continue doing the personal work that is needed‼️
Blessings and Favor to the both of them. I pray that they will reconcile because they are both “ brothers” in Christ.
you have to be a great man to apologize like you did!
Love you Will!!❤️
You are human making mistake is human the most important thing is to recognize your mistake and try to make yourself a better person.  You are still a role model to us to me.  I'm hanging on and still looking up to you.
Oh Will, Awesome video ♥️  Thank you... There's probably a million things I could say. But I'm not going to. I'm just going to thank you again for the amazing sincere apology...... ♥️
We Love you Will! Keep your head up!🤍
Love how he's so rich he can get away with this. The entitlement is insane. Boycott Will Smith movies.
You hurt the man who brought back the saw franchise I will never forgive you
everybody makes mistakes everybody has those days
There are no humans in this comment section
No Love lost Will just a learning experience step 1 of owning up to your mistakes is key we're still here for you 💯
I really appreciate the message you put out. That you're clear and honest and you literally practice what you preach. No human being is perfect, that's just impossible. It's not going to be easy for either of you but I hope yourself and Chris can move on with this as best you can. Peace and love from a fan since fresh Prince ✌️
Damn this is a wholesome comment section. More of this, world!!
You still found a way to make this corny.
Cold apology, still defending the undefendable. The only one who he should be talking to is Chris, but he wants his fans back. Why not wait until Chris is ready? why once more make it about you? Now Chris is again going to be bombarded with this situation....btw everything seems very produced in this video. I believe he is remorseful but I don't by the apology. If this wouldn't of happened in front of the entire world, I don't think he would had apologize.
We are all imperfect, but when you make your bed you lay in it. Tuck yourself in and sleep tight 🤡.  What a coward move.
Well done, Will. You did the good thing by apologising and speaking out. Proud of you but don't worry we all make mistakes sometimes and by owing up to the mistakes that we have caused. God knows that we did the right and honorable thing. Appreciate the video. ❤️👍
Jusy keep Jaden away from playing Miles Morales and we're cool
we love you bro ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've been praying for you 🙏🏾 ❤️
You are just human, work it over Willard, love you man!
Thanks You for LOVE all! 🍝🍮🌈💐😭🌭🎊🎊🥪☕🍳🌮🍩🤣😁🍼❄️🍟🍓🍞🍇✨👑🥲🍿🥳😜😍💘💗😇💌🥰👼😋😘
Dudes been getting gaslit by that woman for years, glad he admits the mistake but but I hope he can see how toxic she is
Thank you for acknowledging you were wrong!! My faith in you is restored after this! It’s time to forgive yourself!! I forgive you! Let the healing continue!!!! Sending positive vibes and prayers!!
Bro…..I send you peace, acceptance, and self forgiveness.  🙏🏾
Apology accepted and appreciated!
Nice to see him finally speak out and be hands on over the situation.
"oh you know what youtube loves......apology videos" yawn
This shows how important is to have a partner that give you mentally stability. It's painful to see Will in all of this situations and all cracked up in opposite of videos like in Budapest and so on where you could see him living and enjoying.  Hope you get what you need to get stable and solve the issue with Chris . congratulations for admitting your errors and trying to fix them. Keep strong 💪
off topic the set looks great
cliché but ok
i was here
Come on man 🤦🏽‍♂️
I forgive you, Will!
The damage to personal relationships as you said may be irreparable, however it does appear that the pain and growth - all parties experienced will lead to new strength and new positive outcomes for all parties.  That is certainly my hope for your family and the Rock's.
This is the conversation Will needs to have in private with Chris, not in front of a camera trying to get people to feel sorry for him.
Good on you!! True sincerity.
*”Unfortunately, no matter how genuine we are, there are some folks in the world that don’t know our mind, heart, or soul and will still say what we pour out publicly is bull because they assume they know us better than we know ourselves, and they believe they have some god complex to determine if our apologies are deemed worthy to the masses. All we can do is be sincere, speak our peace, and move forward. Keep moving forward. Do not become stagnate and defeated by their bullying and attacks. Stay positive, stay safe, stay healthy, and continue to learn from mistakes and spread peace and love young King!” ✌🏾❤️🤴🏾 - Success Definers (Eddie Jaroul), Valor Mode*
Everyone makes mistakes still a fan 💯 just because you did that doesn't make you bad person you apologized
Even though you may never see this... Thanks for taking the time to  address this publicly but more so for taking the time to heal. Just remember you have the support of your fans. Take your time there's no rush. Get better and come back to us when you're ready. Much love.
We all like you in movies, but looking at your recent few apologies, makes me feel like not to take you seriously anymore.... you are work in progress human we all agree. But being Public figure you have responsibility to tell your follower to not treat you as their role model, let follower choose better role models. Hugs and Peace
We need to extend the same grace we would want. I pray he and Chris and their families heal and be ok.
Divorce that thing
I will pray for Chris and Will.  For Chris, I pray your mind can heal in a way that allows you to move on from your attack.  I pray for you to have freedom from replaying the pain in your mind.  I ask God to help you truly forgive... Not simply to say you are ok when asked, but to truly be ok within when no one's around.  This is my sincere hope for you Chris.  For Will, I pray you are able to internalize the severity of your actions... Simply because of your actions alone and not because of career repercussions.  I pray empathy emerges from within for your victim and that the words you've said have meaning to you.  I ask for God to bestow his grace upon you and Chris.  I hope both of you can truly be ok in the end.
I’m sitting here researching how to tile a shower surround and this came up. And I watched it. Let me know if you or Chris have any tips for tiling a shower. Otherwise, I don’t look up to celebrities, and they’re just people like the rest of us. But they probably don’t waste time tiling their own bathroom. Good for you.
Great job Will!!! Admire you and Chris very much and love you both!! Stay happy fellas!!
Man!!! I salute your courage and humility, bro! Good job!
Move on fresh prince. People often forget there r more major things going on in the world. Takes guts to come out n say what u did. Respect brother
Finally... finally.. finally.  I've been praying for you both, Will.  Still got love for you. Still got love for all your talent.  Finally... finally. An apology.  I hate that it took this long, Will.  Finally... finally.  Yes. Let's heal....
This took courage. To face your own failures and publicly apologize shows growth. But the apology should have been sooner. I feel for Will but Chris has to accept his apology.
You need to spend some time with your uncle in Belair
I grew up on fresh prince of belair have been a fan from that point…but if I’m being honest I think will needs to get rid of all negative energy and people from around him doesn’t really matter who they are
That’s what we need from you Apologize and you did apologize so let’s move on and as matter fact mistakes are part of human life we all do mistakes and we do apologize and those who loves us will forgive us LUV u MAN🤍
This is Good!❤️ Real men apologize. I pray the Lord continues to bless you and keep you. Glad to see you're moving forward. 💞
this isnt an apology to chris, this is just all about him. if he really was sorry he should meet chris one on one.
Chris, you have to answer for your words! This is a lesson for you for the future! Will, you have nothing to apologize for and no one to apologize to! You acted like a man who defended the honor of his family! 👍
❤💖💕
Fawk will
Another prideful video, shame.....
For all the great and amazing things you've done and brought to the world if people can't overlook a bad moment then they don't deserve the grace and gifts you have to give.
This guy is wack.. beta vibes
You’ve lost all respect from me and everyone I know
Him and Chris need to talk privately and hug it out
🥰🥰🥰🥰
You’re doing the work and that all that matters. You’re human, you fucked up, and you’re trying to make it right as best you can. We forgive you brother, keep doing the work and gifting us with your talents. We love you Will ❤️
I get that he did something he shouldn't have, but it is a world where celebrities are found to be literal monsters on a nigh weakly basis, what WIll did is pretty minuscule in comparison.
Damn that women broke this man.
Don’t worry pal we all believe you and we all love you so much ❤️
I cant help but feel bad .. you can tell this was rough for him! I proud of him. & mistakes happen
No one can live up to an image.  Don't beat yourself brother. It's all good.
"I'm human" we're all well aware of that fact.  Please get better help Will, wishing you well going forward.  Little tip - surround yourself with less sycophants, you'll grow significantly in ways you really need to.
That’s weird… weird that it could take you this long to put out a heart felt apology. What you need to do, because obviously you are lost, is to go help your children. Like, there is something seriously wrong with them.
Love you Will
This is a really good apology. No excuses, just straight up owning up and apologizing. We all make mistakes, we are only human. This shouldn't follow him anymore.
Outside the bizarre bubble of Hollywood there is a place called LIFE.  In life... your own forgiveness of yourself is really all that matters...to your sense of wholeness and self love. Your journey is big Will, and I imagine this event will serve to catapult you into the greatest teaching moment you have for humanity yet.  We see your big heart.  This incident doesn't erase its largesse or your loving mission.  Breathe, and keep on keeping on.  Blessings
Sounds scripted as f.
Will Smith is a hypocrite. He only apologized online. Never directly to Chris. He's never called or texted to Chris
He done wrong. His human. I am still a fan ,  lets ALL move on from this.
Love this 🙌🏽❤️
I'm not going to lie, your behavior that night shocked me to my core and bothered me more than I ever expected.  However, you are still beloved to us all.  That's why your actions that night hurt as much as they did.  The world will ultimately forgive you but first you must find a path to forgive yourself.  You are worthy Will Smith and I appreciate your words today. ❤️
When my parents divorced I was devastated your like 10 years but after I got older and began to experience my own trials and tribulations of love I am glad they divorced.  It allowed each parent to pursue happiness.  P.S.  I believe Will experiencing with ayahuasca also influenced his behavior.  The power of drugs like that can cause long lasting changes good or bad to the brain.
I’ve lost count on the word “ You know”
whatever happened happened. look forward and come back stronger Prince.
He start losing roles and monies and that's why he is making a video. He still didn't explain WHY did he do it. You shamed yourself and Chris in front of the whole world, but people here in comments will mostly be saying "YAAAAS KING" while they were the same who sh*t on you when it happened.
I love him😩
Keep your head up king were all human
My guy!! I missed you, Will!
All my love goes to Chris and Will. Only god knows how hurt they got. I'm praying for you guys and i hope this all pass
always start with a sigh everyone
I believe Chris will forgive and things will start to get repaired. It will happen. Forgiveness is better than malice. Brothers don't fight for long.
It was all fake anyways
We still love and appreciate you Will, you are only human. If my family would give me half the apology, and self reflection like you have,  I would forgive them too, but they feel like they haven't done me wrong. I on the other hand beg to differ.  Keep your chin up.
Why did it take you 4 months to apologize?
I hope he just lays low for a bit no need to rush or anything. it's been working for someone like Kanye as well whos been dealing with his own personal issues and behavior and i think thats the best direction especially in the absurd life of being a celeb in the public spotlight
Love you Will!
All could fall down into temptation don't feel worry Every day is a fight. We at Earth for start again everyday remember who's with Godself nothing against him
Before I watch just gotta say l love you man. You like father to me ✊️
I forgive you and so does God❤️❤️❤️🥰
Much love 👊🏼
“Am trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself” Will Smith
Lifting u up Mr. Smith! U r a light so keep shining bright! Sending love to u and ur family!
Your only human will!! Like damn man this is crazy. N I love both you guys! It just sucks this happened n I wish nothing but the best for both great black men! Especially for our culture! Yall play such a big part of for YEARS!!
Eh......No Thanks
Nobody cares anymore it’s an old story so everybody including will and Chris get over it
Even though you apologize, Because you know for real this is inevitable, you still lost my respect.
Sorry Will, you are too late.  You have fallen from GREATNESS to another VENGEFUL human
Proud of you for this Will. Everyone makes mistakes, it’s what you learn from them that’s the lesson.
Hard to call it a mistake when you walked 30 feet to swing on a guy. Plenty of time to think about the decision beforehand. Regardless, I hope you two can work this out.
Cheer up fresh prince. We are humans and make mistakes. The important thing is self realisation. We look up to you and we love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you Will. 🧡💜 I'm so thankful and proud of you for taking your time to come out with this video and these answers. I knew this is how you felt in that moment, and I'm looking forward to when you're ready to answer more. You just needed some breathing space to be able to articulate it as well as you just did. Stay strong, people are just people, and we ALL make mistakes. Us regulars of the world just don't have it broadcast. Keep your head up 🧡💜
We love, and we will always love you. You can never fall from our eyes as a good, responsible and kind human who made a mistake and who is coming out and taking responsibility for his actions. We are with you till the end, brother.
You should have been arrested tbh
We all have to deal with the consequences of our actions. Love the gesture Will. We all have to learn to forgive ourselves an learn to love us as we are. All my love and power to you.
We love you will
Thank you GOAT! It’s all about learning from our mistakes! YOU DIDNT LET ALL OF US DOWN!
I love you Will and I appreciate you taking the time to humbly apologize to everyone for this terrible mistake.  I think you deserve grace.❤
Your only human man. You show the humanistic side of celebrities that not many others do. I'm proud of you sir! We all make mistakes. We who care about you and respect you have your back. You are proof that no matter how big or successful you are, you can still make mistakes and learn and grow from them. Thank you for showing us that you are jus a human being like us all and even someone like you in your stature can make mistakes. We love ya Will!
💙💙💙💙💙💯
Damn, fam. I hope you are on the path to solace.
You need serious help Will Smith.  Excuse after excuse.
Him calling this girl “babe” after all she publicly did to this man makes him look so soft definitely not the man I seen in I am legend
You made a mistake … you’re a good man …. Don’t be confused you will over come this and we love you !
Will we all make mistakes we all do bad decisions but we all learn from them
Know that we got that out the way ....how about I Am Legend 2
Very humble apology and your pain is felt through the screen and your words.  Doing work to heal and being available for Chris and his family for their healing is commendable. I hope you and everyone affected find acceptance, forgiveness, and growth.  Many will learn important lessons, look up to, and be proud of both you and Chris for how you deal with this.  This video is a terrific start.  Much love to you both.
Try harder
Great acting, unfortunately, I would be ashamed of myself if I had done what you did.  It was a shock to the world but most of all no example to set to anyone, never mind your own children.  You're not invincible, you have a duty to your fans, the people who made you.  Yeah, you are a great actor, I don't know if you're a great guy, but this definitely told the world something new about you.  You owe an apology to your young fans especially, you need to make amends for them and to them.  Saying you are trying not to be ashamed - still does not set a good example to those young people out there.  Your behavior was disgusting. Drop the Ego
Many good people make mistakes. You are doing the work and taking responsibility. Sending you support and ❤!
Can you say PR spin?!?  All about the dollar....
If only we expected this type of apology from our elected officials, whose policies affect us daily, we could actually have a better society.
So...I'll take his words at face value but I am so a little upset that he has a bottle of his wife's water that she sells and this video has a link to buy his book "Will". That feels self-serving and the optics are bad.
It's good to be humbled and to slow down. Recover and rebuild.
Proud
we love this accountability 💜 you could tell his responses were well thought out and tried his best to address everyone involved. love you will!!! and love and light to him and everyone involved 🫶🏽
Apology accepted and I will go back and enjoy your movies again . Respect !!!
Siempre te recordaré como la persona que fuiste en los Óscares 2022.
It's difficult to me trust you because you're wearing the Wario's cap, he is a bad guy
It's a start... I'm glad he apologized to Chris. Chris deserved this apologized.
spend a night in jail like everyone else would have.  if you're truly sorry then you'd accept that you need jail time and probation.  all you did was prove that privilege is real when you have money.
We all make mistakes. It takes a strong person to admit and hold himself accountable for his actions. It's ok to take your time because you would want your apology to be authentic. Thank you Will Smith!
Respect. This is not an easy thing to do.
You know it's time to apologize when they start canceling his movies
We love you, Will. Mistakes are a part of life. It’s how we choose to address and rectify those mistakes that shows our true character. Hoping those that were hurt can find it in their hearts to forgive you. ❤️
You are a good human Will. Everyone makes mistake. We love our fresh prince. What you did is wrong, but you realised your mistake. We are with you ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks You God Father for all beloveds at eternity and than never fault You 🍝🍮🌈💐😭🌭🎊🥪☕🍳🌮🍩🤣😁🍼❄️🍟🍓🍞🍇✨👑🥲🍿🥳😜😍💘💗😇💌🥰👼😋😘we LOVE You both thanks You! At Heaven just one family don't forget it just wait
I am a fan of yours.  Admittedly, a bigger fan of Chris.  I am glad to see that you are taking accountability and hope my faves can have that talk. I felt your sincerity and you have my respect.
This was bizarre to say the least.  Maybe Will regrets what he did, but why did it take 4 months for this to be said?  Too little too late in my opinion.  The actions of himself that night, including attending the Vanity Fair party with not a care in the world to his own kids tweeting "And that's how we do it," was disgusting on very possible level.  Don't call us again, we'll call you.
It takes a man to be humble enough to apologize.
It's ok your human hope you are taking care of yourself
We all my mistakes
This is about trying to recover a career and reputation by appearing to be "the bigger man" willing to apologize to everyone. Of course the behind the scenes meetings with publicists, executives, advisers, and PR firms over the past 3 months is not mentioned. Just wait for the, "Everyone deserves a second chance", media tour to happen next year. He knows the recovery is going to be a long game, about 2-5 years. But he also knows that HE may come out on top as the fake hero if he plays it right and manipulates enough simpletons.
I do admire the fact that he did this. He is a huge international star and to sit there and say he was wrong and not try justify it takes some strength. Of course he should not have done it to begin with. That’s obvious. But he said that and and accepted responsibility. We should all be that willing to admit it when we do something wrong.
Much props Will. Always been a huge fan of you, and we are only human. I appreciate you admitting your mistake, and all we can do is forgive each other and move on. Forgive but do not forget. Best of luck to you man! Much love
Sometimes in life you can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube.
So much respect for this maturity move 🙏
We love you ❤️
He’s honestly human and unfortunately he’s in the public eye so human mistakes that he makes will be seen by everyone.
WE LOVE YOU WILL, ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY & YOU'VE TAKEN THE RIGHT STEPS, NO LOVE LOST🙌🏾♥️
A huge WOOOSAH!!! Deep breathes and healing energy for EVERYONE!!!
124 Days later?  Please....
Looks like wills PR guys finally got through to him!
I like this You much better. Well done!
Respect!
Mad capping 🤣🧢
At some point we all find ourselves in a place where we must reflect on our actions. This is a part of the human experience. You have my love and support. Blessings brotha ✌🏾💛
I heard will smith is a jerk in real life. This just reaffirms this.
Blah blah blah...hope this saves my career...blah blah blah
You’re a good man and thank you for showing people how to apologize when a mistake is made.
We all make mistakes Will and we're all here for you
No one is perfect Will... we forgive you
He's just trying to salvage his career and reputation.  His actions were inexcusable.  I was a big fan of his for years but not any more, despite whatever apologies he gives for his actions.
All of us make mistakes in life…can’t hold nothing against Will…I just hope he and Chris are able to move on from this moment.
All love small uncle Phil 💛💛
Will you raised me by watching fresh prince of Bel-Air and what I have learned from all of this is that you just like me. Human that make mistakes that learn from it and move on I hope Chris family take your amends
Thank you for sharing this video with us.   I hope every friendship that was hurt that night can be rescued. These relationships are all we really have in life.   When it happened, my only thought was that a genuinely nice person just messed up and did an awful thing to another genuinely nice person. This happens every day but you had the misfortune to be on a world stage when it happened to you. I hope you are able to move on. I’m sure you’ll be a better person as a result of the whole thing in the long run.
Damage done. Reputation destroyed. Will smith is a coward and a looser.
We've all been there.
still time enough to drop the witch intent on bringing you down
Crazy how the whole thing resembled the dhar mann skit. Call me crazy but theyre all planned out distractions imo 🤷‍♂️
Philly support Philly 🙏🙏
Love for you Always 🙏🏼🙏🏼💙💙💪🏼💪🏼
Am the  most happiest human today,to see Wills back....we love you smith. We all make mistakes and we deserve forgiveness
Will I’m glad you’re back man, I’ve missed you, we all make mistakes, we’re all humans, but don’t let one mistake define your whole career and humanity
We still love you Will! I agree EVERYONE makes decisions that weren't right at the moment but nobody knows what a person is truly going through at that second. Things happen right or wrong but we grow and learn from them. I will always follow you know matter what. Human is human no matter what title you have in this world. God bless you and your family.
We love you Will and one moment will never erase all that you gave to the culture! ❤️
I love you Will!!!❤️❤️❤️
Welcome back it's about time... everyone goes thru stuff that the world wouldn't and shouldn't understand ✊✊✊✊
Good to have you back 💯❤️
imagine what was the budget for this video 😂 from background, outfit, video production all the persons behind the cámaras and probably a writer 😂😂 and to make it worsts there is a ad under the video promoting the will smith store 😂😂
First reason why i was mad with Will Smith was because that action was objectivly wrong, what he did. Second reason is because he didnt apologize for some time. But now i think he is genuine in his apology and i find it sufficient enough. Time to let this go, because everyone makes mistakes and there are very few things you can do to repair them, one is proper apology, wich i think i believe, so good on you Will.
It was very disappointing to see what you did to Chris. But I believe that everyone deserves a chance for forgiveness and redemption.
A man assaults a woman, then the attacker expects to be forgiven, why? You messed up on world wide TV. Sorry doesn't cut it.
This is brave, this is humble, this is a man after all. Bless you Will!
Eres un ser humano extraordinario, eres mi actor favorito. Todos cometemos errores y es de valientes pedir disculpas y reconocer, todos te apoyamos y sabemos que vas a seguir adelante dándonos alegria con todo lo qué haces, el mudo te ama Will
🖤U Wil! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
It is never easy to apologize.  Proud of you!!!!!   Now to really make things right you need to cast me in a movie you are doing ... LOL ... A little levity ... But really call me.
Love you Will
This is one of the very few apology videos that will probably get accepted
You're just human Will. Everyone has gone through bad judgment calls and thats ok as long as you realize what yiu did was wrong and try making up for it
I have big respect for both you and chris equally from someone in the uk who seen both and enjoy your comedy whether on tv or standup.. hope you two make up and a real make up is to make an epic comedy movie together 🤲
Keep your head up! We support and love you in Philly.
Ok he wrote these questions hes having trouble reading?
oh pleeeeaaaaasssse 😂🤡😂🤡😂🤡😂🤡😂
You good will don’t even trip we are all human at some point we make mistakes! You will be alright hopefully sooner than later I’ll never get tired of seeing you on the big screen!!!
❤️
unhinged and washed up. just give it a rest already - you are no longer relevant.
Smack
We all make mistakes Will. It’s because you are a very famous public figure and it was on everyone’s 📺. Trust…if you had not been a very famous public figure and it had not been on the 📺 we probably wouldn’t have heard about this incident. It’s so many of us who have made HUGE mistakes and because we’re not in the “limelight”, no one knows or will EVER know what we did! Was it right what you did, no it wasn’t, but that’s why it’s called a MISTAKE and being HUMAN. Chris will one day forgive you…in his time not yours so don’t force it. After all, someone has forgiven him before.
When I was a kid, I used to think you were cool.
For what it's worth, I believe Will is sincere and I will give him the benefit of that doubt. He's still an amazingly gifted and talented man, and I genuinely hope he's getting whatever help he needs right now. That being said, when we transgress against our fellow man, it's a little like throwing a brick through a famous painting. It's damaged. With time and patience and effort it can be patched, but that hole will always be there. So it is with this. With time and effort and a bit of forgiveness when the parties are ready, things can be mended. The key here is "mended"; they will never be the same as before the damage was done. Come to grips with the fact that while you may repair the bridges, much water went under them when they were ruined. That can't be undone. In very rare instances, things can be made even better, but that takes heroic effort on everyone's part. Let's see if you're up to the challenge. God bless.
Proud of you ❤️ glad to see you doing better. Wishing you and yours happiness and peace 💕
We're all human and we all make mistakes. But unlike most our mistakes are not televised around the world. For me the incident seem too unreal to be true, but in the end it was. Only Will can fix Will. Time will heal.
You haven’t lost a fan, you’ve brought more happiness to us then unhappiness, thank you for that! Been watching you since I was kid and have been a big fan of you. Keep your head up this will pass
A wonderful first step Will! I am encouraged that everything is going to be alright.
Funny how some of yall still dont forgive Will yet yall be supporting some of yall favorite rappers who done far worse
If God can forgive so can we.
Will, you are loved. All of us, your fans, everyone, we all love you, and we will always love you. Forgive yourself, because all of us already have. We love you, bro. Come out out of this bigger, better, and PUT THE LORD FIRST. I promise you, He will not fail you. One love. You will triumph. Pick yourself up and and move on, and on a personal note, please return as Deadshot and do a Bright 2. You don't know how many of us want to see those characters return. Some of your best roles ever, truly! Bright 2, just do it!  - Just a Simple Fan, Brandon.
I love you Will Smith!  So happy to see you back!!! I have been so concerned about you.  You’re great you will (Will) be fine. Thanks for sharing and apologizing and doing what’s right NOW.  The past is the past… to the future.
He apologized. It’s up to us to forgive him or not. I’m choosing to forgive and let it go.
This is... confusing. A praised celebrity who made a serious f*ckup and which brought him down to the levels of a mere human and an apology which took its time. I have so many questions and thoughts but I can say this : it's surprising to see this mere human bring a genuine statement and an apology that seems is coming straight from his heart. There's some merit in that...
The world still loves you will
This shows that even if they are a celebrity, they are still human at the end of the day and make mistakes like us normal people
We’ll be friends again! ❤️👍
It’s ok Will, we all make mistakes in life, don’t punish yourself for a mistake you weren’t in the right frame of mind at the time. Just grow and move on from this experience, glad to see you’re getting therapy. It will be alright, your still a great man inside, don’t let this stop you from being great! Love your forever fan! ❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏
We understand....we are all human and prone to mistakes. I have a lot of respect for you because you are accountable. Keeping you in my prayers 🙏🏾 ❤️.
4 months later…better late than never.  No one is perfect, unfortunately the hurt and pain has now set in for everyone involved. Hopefully some healing and some growth can happen.
People always wear white in their apology videos. White shirt, white hat... It feels manipulative. I think his apology is sincere. I just wish he hadn't done the same thing as every influencer in every apology video ever.
I've never not rocked with will Smith much love to will smith
You have never once let me down, you’re still my idol and you’re still THE FRESH PRINCE
Thank you for sharing your truth, and being 100% real and honest. Most in your position would not have the courage to be open and vulnerable nor accountable. We all F-up. You're an incredible human being, Mr. Smith. And you continue to be a role model for surviving life.
❤️
He's genuine in his apology and he has shown, throughout his life, that he's a caring, loving human. Celebrities have done FAR worse and have been forgiven and there's no reason Will can't be forgiven and move on.
Will you are human you can't change what happened but what you can do is reinvent yourself and heal.. you've got this
That was dope 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
blah blah blah
No one is perfect! You're a stand-up human being, and this is why I will continue to be a fan.
We all hope you're doing better
Man he didn’t have to do this but he did. Props to will for owning up to his mistakes
Will no need to apologize.  Live and let it go.
Bored after the first 30 seconds
A nearly perfect career. He’s worthy of a pass
I’d suggest you watch the fresh prince of bel air series once again…  Good on apologizing, takes a man.  Nothing but love.
Nobody is perfect. We all need to think about that saying a bit more. And simply find ways of improving upon ourselves.
You smacked the sh** out of us
Bruh why are you trynna bring up old drama for more attention again. Just apologize to Chris privately and end it there. The whole world doesnt need to know your dirty laundry all the time man
Sill wmith
Really should never have done it, so utterly immature
You have put love joy and life in the world so never think twice…we all have fallen short of the Glory of God…and to be transparent it’s the worst feeling to experience in your heart I still love you and every time I watch my favorite movies with you in if, it will always put a smile on my face!! Peace and Love brother..
His wife's got that Michael Jordan haircut
Thank your fans that stand by you!🤷🏽‍♀️
I know you will probably never see it, but I sent you a message via IG after this happened. I still stand by that message. This apology lifts us all. Thank you.
You are right, you are human. Keep growing. In love.
When is I am legend 2 coming out? 😂🧟‍♀🧟‍♂🧟

LOL good work PR team, Will Smith is not in touch with reality at all. Delayed PR apologies aren't going to re-garner respect.
Man blessing and continue showers of love. Create your own platform. People been poking at you and your family for a long time. Oh now everybody mad cause you stood up. Something people are afraid to do so they grab they 🔫🔫 whose the real hero the one that takes a life or spare one.
Im probably a nobody, but I’m from Dominican Republic, and we all respect you over here. I could talk for large community’s si ce I own a local radio show and YouTube channel that influence minds. In my eyes you are not a *P of S * you come a long way from the bottom making it in a white collar society and been the role model of a lot of people. I Believe, I’m sorry we believe in you more then ever. Because you have showed us 3 months ago. That you are not perfect but a work in progress and this event will allow you to keep growing. Maybe the academy wants to shake what you build, but is been years of influence , hard work , ups and downs to make it happen. On a personal note, I understand you love J a lot but don’t put yourself out there for her, she will not appreciated what you do, in the Dominican Republic 🇩🇴 as a whole we are not really contento of how she has represented You over the years, I feel there is no team of you are the only one pushing the car. You are great , greater the. A lot of people and nothing was giving to you.. with hard work and dedication you made luck 🍀 so keep making luck 🍀.
Water bottle turned toward the camera....gotta get that promotion in on that PR apology huh
Wow even real celebs getting in on the apology videos
Give Chris a fair one then
LoL, you're already gone buddy.   Forgot about you already Will. Career wasn't inn good mode lately. Goodbye Fresh Prince haahahaha
6.7K dislikes. Let’s get this to the most disliked video.
Best advice ever.....   Make a mistake.. Apologize publicly with humility.. Gain everyone's respect.. Even of those who never gave a fu*k about what you did since the beginning.. 🤷‍♂️
this seems so forced and insincere, almost condescending.
One of the curses of being a actor is u think they always acting. Oh well life goes on.
Very nice to hear that from him wish this video was longer though.
Here's the thing. Will. You said you were in a fog. But yet no problem. Dancing up the storm at the after party. Probably not until you heard about all the pushback in your career falling apart. Did you really feel bad?
WS is an idiot. "I apologize" is not an apology. FU forever. He’s such an entitled prick that I will boycott. I'm Sorry!!
Videos like this need to be very grateful that YouTube took the dislike button away. Even I’m against it, I now kinda see the benefit of it not being there not gonna lie.😅
i have the up most respect for you sir ,and will always be a friend,and a big fan
You’re one of the most wholesome human beings in the world, everyone makes mistakes but it takes a even bigger person to realize that and accept that he was wrong. This doesn’t make you any less than a good man.
Didn’t hear him say “I’m Sorry” a single time.  Disingenuous.
I really hope chris listens, this man is sorry. No one's perfect. Love you will... keep aspiring for better.
Bad things happen; it's inevitable. It's important that you apologized. Big love for you, man.♥️
Everyone can f"#¤ up and its good to c that you seem alright, i hope you are. Saying you are sorry is one thing, meaning it is the important part which i belive you do. Anyway i hope YOU are ok cus i dont think anyone knows how u felt after the media took of after the incident. I guess one grows after something like that. Hope you are ok man🕊
I'm Brazilian and I didn't understand the video, can someone translate for me? haha  Não entendi nada, alguém traduz pra mim? Kkk
Thank you for talking to the public about this and trying to reach out to Chris. Don't hold your breath waiting keep moving and bettering yourself. It was a big thing you did to Chris and the community. It's not going anywhere for a while. But just keep moving and keep working on everything else. Eventually I'm sure Chris will reach out or time will heal, one or the other will give. Love man and get out of that toxic relationship man you can could be best Willie on your own.
This had to be done, no one would have accepted him otherwise, no more movies, no sponsorship, no money.
I aint going nowhere family! Love ya bro!!!
None of this flies. Feel like a "real man" now?
Sorry should have called Chris personally.  You were nit fogged out you were partying that night. Sorry I don't buy it.
i grew up watching you in the 90's and your right were all humans we make mistakes. just because i made one bad choice  your still a hero in my eyes love u will
I feel like he feels like he needs to apologize to us (people) rather than to Chris himself. He only needs to apologize to Chris
"Apologize" is a great and strong word. I start you up Bro !
We are all human and make mistakes.  Make ammends to those you have hurt, correct yourself and move forward.   You are better than the actions you took that night!  Just imagine how Uncle Phil would have reacted!!
Ships dont sink without taking on water. In some capacity you are that ship and have taken on so much and its your time to now clear your heart of those things that have weighed you down. If people are going to define you over the mistakes you make then their ship has already sunk with whats weighing them down and need to do some self reflection. Yes what happened wasnt right but in the moment it happened. I appreciate this and thank you 🙏 be blessed Will ❤️
Todos erramos, importante é saber se o arrependimento é genuio por amor ou se o motivo [é por que o dinheiro começou a diminuir
This is the Will that we know. Thank you for showing us that a real man apologizes and atones for his mistakes
W.
We all make mistakes and you offered an apology and now it's up to Chris to decide what happens next. I admire both of you and I hope that you can both move past this.
Wont get better until you drop that witch by your side.
Your “mistake” is you are staying with a woman that smashed your sons friend…it has ruined your life. Leave the demon woman screwing up your legacy and life…
Thanks for your apology Will. It’s very sincere.
Love you Will!  We got your back, always and forever 💛🙏💛   May your end be greater than your past, in Jesus name🙏🙏🙏
I still love you Will. Never stopped. ❤
He's back yayyyyyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 I'm so happy rn you don't what this means to us will.
You are human. We all make mistakes and deserve forgiveness. Praying for you!
thank you Will
That's awesome Will. I forgave you a long time ago I knew you had to be going through something internally for that to happen. You're doing the work. You apologized. We still love you and respect you, even more now.
Been waiting for this video for so long
My man it’s all good family as a fan your always going to be will smith. You had a moment and it’s okay bro. Life must continue… we all been there. It’s shows character for you to come out like this and express how you feel. People don’t have to accept your apology and that’s okay too long as you know your doing the right thing in your heart to express how you feel about the whole ordeal. Salute bro and keep your head up stay strong because Hollywood won’t be Hollywood without “will smith”. Period !!!!  Blessings….
I hear your sincerity. And you've made your apology but there is another step that needs to be taken: one needs to ask for forgiveness. And once you ask for forgiveness it is out of your hands. You are in my prayers as you walk this journey.
We’re rooting for you Will!
I am still a fan. I still love all of your work, your laughter, charisma etc...wishing you and your family all of the best. GOD bless ❤🙏
Smartest director will cast Chris and Will in one film and this film will break all records!
I'm so proud of you and I'm sorry that your family had to deal with this. It is sad this was allowed to get to this point. Stay strong and you still have alot of supporters.
maybe call chris instead of putting it on youtube. just a thought 🥴
Man, we love you. Always have and always will.
You've done everything you can do, the ball's in his court
Will, God Bless You! You're still and always will be one of my favorite people 👑! Through the good and bad, mistakes and all! 💜🙏🏾💜🙏🏾💜
❤
Ainda sim pra mim Will Smith é um cara incrível e talentoso nada mudou. Sempre fui e semprei serei seu fã!
OG OG OG OG OG 💯❤️.
Leave that woman and you'll be good
Apology accepted! U got this big bro
Life is short.. let's not waste it hating each other.. live and let live. 🙏
Why did you wait this long? You've been taking way too many L's for that woman embarrassing you in public like that. I had some respect for you prior to this nonsense.
Wow. He hasn’t fully embraced it and owned it. Wants to control the narrative of him in his head which is a coping mechanism. I understand it. He’s still working. He gotta wear that “POS” title. You gotta own it.
We know it wasn’t you bro!!! The real you laughed and was having a good time, until you saw jadas face she ain’t have to tell you anything you saw it in her face that’s all you needed your body reacted to her expression no need to hide it
Mad love!
No way : D
The root of the problem still exists will....Signed Uncle Phil😢
This was beautiful❤️ Looking forward to seeing Emancipation.
Will you are human! We all make mistakes! You are still my fav human! Keep your head up! We still love you! 💜
It’s all about him and his family when he apologises. He obviously has underlying insecurity issues and really just comes across as a self centred and egotistic individual.
Love you, Will.  And honestly, people need to stop shitting on him as if they themselves never had a low moment.  Will Smith = celebrity. Willard Carroll Smith II = human, who makes mistakes. We're all out here still growing and learning.
Hope you realize who your real friends are now.  Wish you well Bro.!  I still say Chris was outta pocket, js.
I almost slept hearing him speak 🗣
That was deep... you made a mistake, as we all do, God knows far worse mistakes have been made, off camera fortunately... you're trying to make things right. I think I speak for damn near everyone when I say: You have our love and respect, you've always had it, because you are a good person.
It's always felt like the rules never applied to yiu and yours. You've all acted very "above" everyone else and that definitely spread to your spawn. You fucked around and finally found out. It couldn't have happened to a better person.
It’s a start
I forgive you bro, let now go have a beer and get past thsi
Klarifikasi Amerika
Retire and dont do stuff tbh you are uncontrollable
The way he acted was completely inappropriate, but with that being said, we all make mistakes.  If we don’t give people a path to forgiveness then what’s the point?  I think he is genuinely repentant and we should all allow that, forgive, and move on.
It's the most normal,real thing that you have ever done, in my eyes as a fan, and proof that you're not perfect, and your act for me doesn't diminish your credibility and doesn't erase your accomplishments for one bad lapse in judgement. You owned it and are apologetic! What else can you do? This too shall pass!
we can all say , "  I LOVE YOU , I AM SORRY"  a little more often.
Hes only doing this for him not to lose the fans
You’re never going to satisfy everyone. I highly recommend not resurfacing until that is completely out of your system. I hope growth and development for yourself and yourself only. Stop worrying about everyone else right now. The roots of your trauma are too deep to ignore at this point.
How many bots did your PR team buy to thumb up this video? Be honest.
Guy has millions of people look up to him and disrespects all of them instantaneously, then gets on and answers 4 questions. what a fraud.
I love you man and have respect for you and what you've done in your life! This one mistake shouldn't have impacted your life the way it has. Everyone makes mistakes. I found myself in a similar situation, I snapped and didnt think and even afterwards, was not there.. it was a blur. Good luck to you!
Everyone makes mistakes, what matters most is if you learn from them or not.
This was difficult for you to do, and you have my support and respect as a fan and as an imperfect human being who learns everyday to do better and to unlearn certain things. You deserved to take time to frame this the best way you can , with the kindness and honesty that it deserves.
I love this brother
Love take time to heal God is love. Thanks for explaining what happened. I hope the academy is 👀👀👀
you re woman is your drug dude..
Everyone on every other media: It's been months...too little too late.
your better than that. I actually met you 30 years ago at Delaware State University. You are a good brother.
Te amo 😍
Nope, not an apology - 3/4 of this statement was about how it's affected him. This is all show for the entertainment money people. Saying your sorry and want to be a beacon for love and light in the world...just pretty words.
Wow………….
Now this the Will we all know.
I appreciate this video. everyone makes mistakes, but what makes a good person is owning up to the mistake. we're all human.
Fair enough
Proud of you Willy..it takes a big man to admit his mistakes...RESPECT!!😎👏
I dont feel the apology was from his heart. It feels kinda inauthentic. But what do i know. Hope everyone is okay.
Man ain't nobody stop loving you will  😂 don't be so hard on yourself yeah stuff got crazy both parties was wrong don't let this knock you off your square big dawg
Lmao
Respect 👍🏻
There’s grace for those who seek it ♥️
A world where forgiveness doesn't exist is a desolate world
We love you bro for many of us your characters inspired us to keep living and going on. So thank you we all make mistakes. We love you no matter what!
💕
“I’m trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself” - good on you, Will! ❤️❤️ That shame will hijack your growth.. Keep doing your inner work. Eventually, the people who still want to see you suffer are suffering themselves. Pain loves pain.   Like energy attracts like energy. You are clearly on your way to healing and I wish you and those involved the space and privacy you need to process, heal and grow ✨
You were my number 1 and yes you are human and make mistakes. Thank you for your apology and you are still my number 1.
Thank you Will. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Your human Will yeah you may be a celebrity but your still just a human like myself and everyone else in the world. Everyone has made a mistake in there life where afterwards were like damn I shouldn’t have done that but sometimes anger and hurt will get the better of you. Let it go
Checking in from the DMV.
damage control took a while. the PR team needs to work harder.

❤️❤️❤️
We need Andrew Tate to watch this
We're all human. Still love you Will
You could feel at least a little shame.
Thank You Will Smith
You don't have anything to be ashamed of. We are all human and some have done worse. You shouldn't feel guilty because how people feel
❤️
Tbh I think had all died down, it's probably all been brought back to the surface now. But at least you shown your sorry I guess :)
Always remember, It isn't a real YouTube apology unless the person Sighs before the apologizing begins.
I’m a white 75 year old fart and have made many mistakes for sure. Will next to Clint Eastwood, Robert Downey Jr.,Jack Nicholson, and Gene Hackman, you are rt there as far as my favorite actors. The big problem I have is how long it took for you to express yourself. When is Bad Boys 4 coming out! Good luck to you going forward.
Honorable response…can’t help but be a fan. “You saw my blinker, bih..!”
On the path to healing, let's heal together. Praying for you.
Thanks for sharing and showing that celebrities are humans too. Way to demonstrate how to be vulnerable and admit when you were wrong
Will it take.a real.man say sorry you still one.of pep we look.up to and we still love all.your work bro keep.head up 👊
I couldn’t imagine being judged by my worst mistake while having the entire world witnessing it.
Just turn "antichrist" - no worries. You already have the wario cap.
We, will, still look up to you, even with your mistakes, because you are a human being and come out of it right!
Will makes a good point: that owning up to your mistakes and degrading yourself are two completely different things.
Nah, until Chris accepts to hear you, this means nothing.
Not enough.
Well said and now I hope your action will be as sincere as your words.  Hope you get your 2nd chance with Chris as well!
king
Get da wario memes ready!!!
This is so big of you Will; apologizing to the family especially to his mother.  I'm still a fan & understand your human. Looking forward to your comeback
The good memories and all you mean to me outweigh a human mistake. Nothing but love and understanding to you and all involved. ❤ 🤴
I respect it. But I don't count. All love all love.
Take L+Ratio
I don't care what people say about Will Smith still one of my favourite actors with no doubt 🇮🇪🤘
Never apologize for something you meant to do. S/O to Will for even trying.
You good bro and it's gonna take time for people to get over it.. just know you are human and you are loved..
So meticulously crafted, scripted and performed.  I can only imagine how many publicists and handlers were involved in the making of this video that is produced to seem like it was genuine.  An outstanding performance by an actor, fighting to regain his image and show the mastery of damage control.
Lost a ton of respect for you,if I never hear from you again it will be to damn soon!!!!
Thank you for taking the time to do the work ❤️ Not for us. But for yourself. Thank you.
This whole thing is staged
WE STILL LOVE YOU WILL 🌺
A Cautionary Tale ❤️‍🩹
People can come for me if they want and I’ll answer back to all y’all. I’m very proud of Will for speaking up and apologizing. You are a great man and that’s on period. I wish the media would just STOP. Time to move on cause there to much hate in the world.
We are all humans, humans makes mistakes, humans deserves a second chance no matter what. You just proved that point. Thank you.
From a gamer perspective I liked the word he used "Tarnished" from the Elden Ring
Thank you ❤️ I hope we all can move on now ✌🏻
Love this ❤
I'm sure everybody about to be in the comments as if they aren't human! I love that he apologized, he reached out. I hope they work things out and get past this
We are all human and we all make mistakes,but doing a YouTube video with 2 cameras and montage I don't think is the right way to do it...also "Chris I am ready to talk when you are" didn't really seem like a genuine apology from the heart.I hope the money you get from the views from this video will go to an organization against violence..I hope you find peace and be happy,all the best to you and your family
😘😘
Much respect and I haven't watched the whole thing yet. I'm still and will remain a fan. I know over my many years I've done things that I'm not too proud about. 💞
We never stopped having your back!
Much respect to Will Smith for not disabling comments on this video. That's a read-between-the-lines sign for me that he's sincere.  👍
I honestly think Smith has gone bye bye. His head seems full of fluffed introspective nonsense. He needs to step back into the real world ( maybe spending time with old friends, people he was close to before he made it big) to center himself again. You can see he is a good guy but he has just been swallowed up by the circumstances of his famous lifestyle and the people who come along with it.
Tarde y mal.
I think the hardest lesson to be learned, quite possibly, is that some things really can't be fixed. I believe Will Smith is genuinely sorry...and it's great to see him take that responsibility to TRY and fix the situation...but ultimately, there may not be a way to return to the way things were before. Chris may not be willing to forgive him. The fans and the public may not be willing to fully forgive and support Will Smith. His family and their reputation/image may be forever sullied by the incident and the fallout. Things may be permanently damaged. While forgiveness may be "divine", the world is made up of humans with feelings and while they may not necessarily continue to villainize people for their actions that doesn't mean things go "back to normal".  The apology and contrition may be there...and that's wonderful. The key question is...can Will Smith remain humble in the face of a permanent loss? It certainly can be an opportunity to start rebuilding...but can Will Smith live with the possibility that this may be, forever, a regret? This is one of the hardest lessons for a person to learn...and one that's very difficult because everyone believes that they can fix things...but some things really do break and that is a hard, hard thing...and one that I hope everyone understands that is at stake here. There is a weight to bear...and it shouldn't be about "moving past" it...it should be about "moving on with it". Understand that, to a degree, this action DOES define you...and that can be used as a restraint (holding you back), a crutch (holding you up), a ladder (raising you up), or a platform (raising your voice)...which one of these will it be for Will Smith?
You got problems bro not supporting you in anyway.  Money corrupted you your family and mind. 3 months later for the apology
You're a good man Will! You reacted in the heat of a disrespectful moment. People will still see things the way they want to tho. You just continue to be the good person that you are❤️🥰
No one is perfect. No matter how old you get, no matter how much money you have, no matter how many resources you have, no one is perfect. Keeping making strides in the right direction and you’ll get to where ever you have to go in due time.
All Will Smith did is promote that such behavior is acceptable amongst the Hollywood ilk. Nothing Will Smith can say or wright will excuse his behavior and it just made me rethink who I watch on TV/ Movies.
Eres una excelente persona Will , yo crecí viendo tus películas y vi esa entrega diciplina y ganas de superación que siempre tuviste , sana , perdónate a ti mismo y toma las cosas de quien viene vales mucho hermano mereces lo mejor.  Hay un dicho de un buen amigo tuyo en karate kid:  La vida a veces te tumba , uno decide si se levanta.  Te apoyamos sigue adelante, te mandamos un fuerte abrazo desde Mexico
Better late than never tbh! Infact, I prefer this over a mere PR version done just to minimise damage.   Remember, apologies don't really ever undo the mistakes we commit, it's just a way of showing to those we wronged that we recognise and acknowledge our mistake. It's the first true sign of our willingness to improve and our first step towards improvement.   We may not gain forgiveness, but that's not really the point. To forgive is their prerogative, as It's outside of us but improve is our responsibility.   All the best for your journey!
Oh my god.. you could’ve done this behind closed doors. Another publicity stunt by the Smiths.
You're 3 months late
cant look at you same way guy, its scary. you should go for bad guy roles from now on.
You're still 1 of my favorite influencers throughout my life, you're human.  And you're still great.
Thank you Will. I really am happy to hear those words from you
Well done 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
When people accept that they’re wrong I immediately gain respect for them cause I despise the people who do bad but think they’re right.
Too many times we've seen people "apologize" by making excuses for their behavior. This was not one of those times. I respect you for admitting that you messed up, and look forward to seeing your next project.
Dude is giving the longest sorry I won't mess up again ever to Hollywood. He was answering Twitter questions about his girl telling him something 😂
Good on you Will.  Try not to get caught in the spiral of getting mad at yourself for letting people down because then you're just gonna get madder at yourself for letting ppl down from the previous time and it's a non ending loop.  I could feel your truth in this.
Sounds like childish PR stunt. Using big words and acting as a victim. We know you know it was wrong. We want to hear you acknowledging you think you’re better then others. You still think you are, that’s why this PR Q&A. This video is not an apology its only a reach out to see how many followers you still have. Shallow very American celebrity like empty stunt
King
Hey,I don't have to agree with one's actions, and see that there are particular standards on public figures that places them aside from the standards we are are subjected to. I didn't jump on the bandwagon of criticism on this situation making a video, but I understand we go through things in life and we lash out irresponsibly at the unintended. Not making excuses for the behavior, but I understand, and this right here can be respected. We are all flawed individuals, and our imperfections are often highlighted for judgement by society.
been missing youw 🥲  Mr. Smith.
ok wiill Smith  but don't  do it again
❤️❤️
Chris will be alright. Apparently will is the real victim here😔
i forgive you will.
4:14 I shed a tear i pray that Will heals from all of this! he needs help more supportive people around him
Your just a sad as man.  This video is weak!  Hope to never see you in the spot light again.  SELL YOUR STAKE IN THE 76ers.  WE DONT WANT YOU!  You said you dont want to be ashamed of yourself, YOU SHOULD and you are a POS!
Honestly you didn’t have to apologize for anything. He still hasn’t apologized for his part in this & instead is going around trying to monetize on the incident. Anyway, you’ll always be great in my eyes & the eyes of many of your supporters ❤️ I hope you’ve been taking care of yourself throughout all the backlash from all the noise. ❤️ sending you so much love & light Will. We need more men like you in this world.
God bless you Will and please know that Jesus loves you so much and died on the cross for all of the mistakes we will ever make trust that he has a plan for your life and family's life.
I pray that ALL whom were hurt find forgiveness and I pray Bro. Willard you find forgiveness in yourself. May Allah/God bless you and your Family ALWAYS
Respect. For anyone who has not heard the opening chapter of the audio version of his book "Will", my personal feeling is that all the necessary clues of 'what can happen after a life spent allowing things to build up without being brave enough to do something' are there. This was a volcano that only needed a single thrown stone to trigger the eruption.
No one cares
Major kudos Will. I came to the video angry at you, but this was genuine and I truly hope you get the closure you need
Well, you just perpetuated a stereotype. Or did you?
Finally you're back, I was getting sad that you were gone. Love you Will
Keep your head up OG. I feel no one focused on how you were treated. At times we have to stand up to the people causing us pain. We here for you bro stay strong
Too little too late.. You acted like a big shot, now you can deal with the consequences.
Will let me just say we all make mistakes you made one like alot of other people have made mistakes. Im praying that you and Chris can TALK and move foward with your life and careers.
ur still the goat🖤
me: I'll never watch a Will Smith movie again  also me: watched fresh prince of Bel-Aire for the 40th time
He’s the the thing Ricky Bobby did with his hands at the start of the movie, when he gets nervous on interviews
I’m not sure but does he not usually wear a wedding ring 💍?
if only u can see the dislikes....
Will, you're in a codependent relationship and you've come from a codependent home and you made mistakes because of this programming but I appreciate you recognizing your behaviour. I hope you get out and you can work on the trauma. It's not my apology to accept but I appreciate you recognizing the toxicity of your situation. #freeWilly
Love you Will 💙  Respect for posting this video
Will, your one of my favorite actors! Thank you for doing this! You are a great man and great men make mistakes, humans make mistakes. We forgive you Mr. Smith ❤️‍🩹
what a rubbish apology, the slow...use..of words..... scripted. "was not optimal", this isn't a show. just be straight from the heart...
It would have been cool if Will talked about freedom of speech and how comedians should be allowed to be funny and Chris was in the right
We have all made mistakes and we are all are not perfect.
im still a will smith fan he is still the goat but at the same time hes going through some things well we all do we gotta get him some time to go through some things that he has to deal with keep your head up you will bounce back like you never left.
Wow…I’m hanging on Will. You got all my respect from you making this apology to Chris, his family etc… You are a human being who made a mistake and has taken full responsibility for your actions with no excuses for it. Love you Will❤️
So few people are brave enough to apologize.
Beta
Though the incident was truly a low point in every sense of the phrase, I do commend you for apologizing and taking responsibility for your actions. This reminds me of the time my friend Gulliver and I were discussing the key of Bb minor. Gulliver INSISTED that there are only 4 flats, and I was understandably getting upset because there are of course 5 flats - Bb, Db, Eb, Gb, and Ab. He just didn't accept that there was a Gb! "OF COURSE there's a Gb you buffoon!" I screamed over and over as I became lost in my rage.
I felt the sincerity in this video . It’s still going to be hard getting away from what happened . The pinnacle moment . The highest of high honor and Wow ! Shocking is an understatement but that being said you are human and Nobody is perfect . No reason you can’t come back from this . Most important is your mental health . If you’re in a bad situation currently I hope you find solid ground and plant your roots in new soil . Wishing you the best .
We are humans...we all make mistakes.
You did the right thing then and now
Get back into movies asap bro.
You handled your Karma responsibly. You know how many people were caught on camera and still deny the truth. I love you Will.
It took him three months to post this I bet he has a project coming out soon
Bullshit !!!!!!
You have always been an inspiration Will. I was confused and shocked about what happened but know that the amount of respect I had for you is  completed restored. We needed this. Thank you Will. Much love ❤️
Missed you Will
4:51 "I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed" Ashamed is a synonym of remorse. Shame is a good thing for bad behavior, it shows one has a moral code, a conscience. Trying to apologize without being ashamed shows you haven't humbled yourself to the point of true repentance.
You are human.
Its been 5 months…
Good job you did what you needed to do when you needed to do it .not when the world wanted you to .you did it when you was ready well said 👏
Crocodile Dundee tears. Don’t believe him. He such a good actor lmao
I was soooooooo mad at you. But this is what we all needed. ♥️
Next time stay in your own weight class son.
I literally just finished your audio memoir yesterday. I felt that when you said that letting people down is something that hurts you deeply. I love you Will. No matter what, I'm glad I got to see you again.
“My history with Chris” meaning he was fed up with Chris bullshit
Awesome 👍🏽👍🏽 God bless you Will 🙏🏾
<3
So proud of you! The best is yet to come!
You're full of it!
it was not just 'a' mistake, it was an entirely mistaken mindset that led to that one action.. hope you examine that
why he talk like that
girl bye #staygone
This is the Will Smith I grow up loving. Deam near brought me to tears especially when he brought up Chris' mom.
much love. you’ll get through this ❤️
You good man.  Get back to being great. Personally I don't feel like noone immediately affected should still be trippin about the situation.
This topic was dying and almost dead to the point it was not making money anymore: TIME TO BRING THE ATTENTION AGAIN
❤️❤️❤️
it’s getting so many views the views are literally glitched
This was a perfect way to respond. Much love Mr. Smith!
You are human bro. Stop saying you’re sorry. Use the word apology instead of sorry. Because you are far from sorry. You haven’t let me down. You’re still a hero in my eyes. And that will never change. You have shown this world black excellence your entire career. And one moment will never be able to overshadow that. Get up dust yourself off and keep it moving. Because this too shall pass. Much love ✌🏾
For some things we do in life we just gotta live with them and not expect other people to help us get forgiveness or closure. Not taking a swipe - we've all done stuff we can't take back and they're not comfortable to carry... but with a little effort they may help us be a better person. And don't forget to cut yourself some slack after you're done beating yourself up.
💕 You're still my favorite. I'm a truck driver and I've listened to your book several times. That was a human moment. It didn't take away how I feel about you or Chris.  Still a fan.
HE'S BACK 🙌🏾 WE LOVE YOU MAN
Good timing Will.
We all make mistakes. I can’t judge you for yours, neither can anyone. This is your journey. You inspire so many people. Keep on keeping on!
Much respect, keep up my man!
Apology Accepted from my end.
✔️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Love you Will!!!
All these years you have been in the public has always been clean u had a mistake happen and you have apologized and we support you!!
look what will did to aunt bib bring her kick off the show this guy been had a shady side to him.
I love you Will Smith ❤
it's been a minute...what a stupid title choice
It is very heartening to see that you have the courage to admit a mistake. A lot of people don't have that, and I respect you more for it. ❤
You've been super famous for a while Will.  Maybe you should live like a regular person for a bit and get some real perspective.
You are a king amongst men. My love and respect for you have grown exponentially. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Now if only Chris can forgive..
People make mistakes and we are not here to judge and whoever hasn’t made a mistake cast the first stone you are a great man I will always be a fan because true fans stick thu thick and thin love you
Yoo i still love u still my favorite ♥
"Nigga please"....gtfoh!
To be honest, I have been your biggest fan since child hood but I was disappointed with what you did and even un-followed you on every social media including YouTube, but an apology is all you can do doe and forgiveness is what we can give as well. I wish you best of luck and I hope to love you back again. 💓
Good on ya Will. Best regards.
So now you are running out of money? Damn I just want you to disappear from my attention but here you go.
You will always be THE FRESH PRINCE, no matter how many mistakes you do, we are all human we all slip up, you are a good man Will and I hope the best to you and your family
This is why YT has removed the Dislike button...
Yea man Will… that was fkd up…. Y’all are brothers and Legends in this sh!7 … came frm sh!7… defied odds…. I know y’all will get back together… he knows it too but… you made him a lil more relevant so he can definitely capitalize off of the publicity 💪🏾💯💯
It's good that you apologized Will.
Y’all eat this up smh
Obivously what you did was wrong man but you are Will Smith my dude we love you and know you are a good person. It doesnt excuse you but we know you arent some terrible person. Its good to know you are taking a good approach to it.
Beautiful. Healing. Good work, super soul. I don't know anyone so perfect they're in a space to judge. What a light to shine through this. You should be proud for making this.
This is a real apology. So proud of you.
I came for the tacos
nah, no way back. Be a man and walk away.
I didn’t hear Im sorry. All I heard was an actor “apologize” over an over but never truly said sorry. We all know when we are being forced to say sorry we say Apologize. He hates when his money is messed with. He definitely needs to do work and remove himself from social media for a while. One smack can take you down in so many ways. Ruined a friendship and possibly his career. His PR team has been working overtime lately. Now a two camera set with fielded questions. Lights! Camera! Action!
I still believe you are an upstanding person! You are also only human. When we see that something said/done hurts the ones we love, our emotions take control and more  times than not, our action/consequence thought process goes null and void. That's what forgiveness is for and you are an amazing person to step up to the plate and do what you did here! Forever a fan of your music and acting!
You always illustrates to have a good heart, Will. Good job!
We apologize to you....
Everyone makes mistakes. Let’s hope the collective humanity can be honest with themselves and relate. It’s a shame what you did to Chris, but you acknowledge and are remorseful. Let’s hope Chris and heal and come to a clearing where he’s willing to speak to you. That’s where the true healing will occur. Peace to you Will
Coming from Philly apologizing is hard like I respect you for that . n we all do make mistakes and I hope yall can talk it over cause yall both put a impact in my life.. 💯💯🙏🏿 Philly Stand Up
I think we`ve all done something stupid in the heat of the moment but i still feel an apology to Chris shoulda came sooner and not after all the fallout thats happened since the awards.
I really appreciated this. Thank you, Will.
Las Las, You go de alright
Excellent piece of PR work, very professionally written. Well done to the Producers and the PR team involved.
nice acting, will.
This took months? Weak. And smug.
At this point there’s nothing else he can do. He’s publicly apologized multiple times and has been sincere with his words. It’s now up to Chris if he wants to move on and forgive Will.
First time I see a video with views almost equal to likes....means you did a good job and a big applause to you Will.
*more likes than views* lol
You say you’re human…. I heard you’re  half robot Will.
We’ve let celebrity’s off for a lot worse so I think Will Should be forgiven. That being said I do always find celebrity apologies insincere only because they are actors and that’s what they do best. I feel like  his first apology original apology should have been enough
You made a mistake.  Yes I get it could've bin handled differently.  Yet you're human. Everyone makes mistakes.  Forgive yourself and move on. Miss you Will.
❤️⭐️

Wow, only 4 months and 2 days late
You're just a guy that made a mistake in front of the world. We forgive you. You are still our Brother...and so is Chris.
Healing. Love❤️🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏻
This feels unnecessary unless it’s just so he can start working again
You've took the correct steps in owning up to your moment of madness. Everyone in the existence of mankind has had a moment like that were we reflect and have an out of body experience.  Chris will talk to you when he processes and internalise what actually transpired on that night.
Will Smith is one of my favorite actors and this is definitely a reason why. He understands it was a mistake and he owned up to it! Will your the best man never forget that.
To us who looked up to Will Smith before this  , We want to let Will  know we still up to him and this video has given us  more reason to do so . #LoveAndLight ♥️ +💡
We’re all sinners and just as filthy before God. Difference is Will’s apologetic and most of y’all are content with being horrible people
you'll probably never read this but, Will you have influenced my life for a long time, from fresh prince when i was young, to the father and Man you are today. I always aspire to be a man like you, and that did not change with this incident. You are human like all of us, and seeing you in a moment of wekness reminds me of that and reminds me that my mistakes are ok to have, and that i need to work on correcting those mistakes. Seeing you take the time to really think about the actions and how this caused so much pain, makes me want to look at past mistakes again and try to do better going forward. keep it up, the physical pain may be gone, but the emotional pain takes a lot longer to heal and relationships renewed. Your fans are here, such as me, and I hope you keep doing the good work that you have done in the past. much love.
You got my support Will, I understand and appreciate this video. Everybody makes mistakes, We learn and make up for it. Only God can save us all in the end. Salaamwalaikum.
I'm still cross with you but I really appreciate this video. I'm sure this wasn't easy for you. In time, this to shall pass.
Bro for what it is worth, what you did broke my heart. I hold you in such high regard. I grew up with you. You are like Family.  A lot of people feel that way about you! I truly wish the best for you! You are more than a role model you are Human! Please be genuine, forgive yourself & alow others to forgive you!
Love Big Boss ♥️
You're given a chance Will. Don't worru
Your human and we love you.
Will you are a legend! 🤩❤️
I've always enjoyed Smith as an actor and personality.  I hope he heals from his own disappointment in himself-above all else, he let himself down on an international stage. There is a great line from Donny Hathaway's Song for You: "… I know your image of me Is what I hoped to be." This video completely captures that line.  His apology is fully accepted by me as part of the public who had mad respect for him. His B.S. years were "light and love." I could always watch a video of him doing something in the "positive vibes" space; something adventurous; and I enjoyed so many of his movies.  But like all of us, he too is an unfinished piece of pottery being shaped and molded every day.  And as a tennis fan, I thoroughly enjoyed King Richard. I look forward to more "light and love" from Smith in the future. May God bless you to forgive yourself. All the best, as you move forward. Be well.
why are people genuinely okay with this? they letting him really be the victim. lol pathetic
You’re human. You were one of the most trusted, respected, loved, and bankable people in Hollywood. You had so much going for you all at once. Had you died night before, you would have gone down in history as a legend. But you reminded all of us that you are human. And nobody is perfect. You are flawed, just like the rest of us.   Now you could stay here in time-out forever. And fade away into oblivion. Or you could show us all who Will Smith is. Drop the pride, own your mistakes, and move forward as the person you are. Not perfect, but authentic.   You can (and should) offer apologies till you are blue in the face; but you can’t make people forgive you.   You will always have critics. But that’s nothing new. The truth is, people who make the ultimate mistakes, gain the most incredible insights. But you’re going to have to keep moving and not give up on Will Smith first. Your going to have to face yourself on that treadmill. I’m rooting for you.
We still love you Will!!!
we know you're a man of peace, Will. the hardest thing to buy, when you're already rich and famous, is good advice -- be it about finances, war, love, sacrifice. redemption for you, Will, is identifying with the non-public, non-famous, common sort of fellows and finding ways to fellowship with them. that was kinda how you leveraged your street cred when you were writing cathartic, comical rhymes to satirize your own justified, however youthful, disillusionment with society. the same society embraces you, still, as heroic -- not despite your blunder, but because of how the blunder humanizes you. it was a pivotal moment of clarity to see that injustice is hard to bear for anyone, but more so for those who thought they had finally escaped it via wealth, power, or fame. the only escape of injustice is the production of redemptive justice. apologies are well-chosen words, but personal redemption is most eloquent.
This is how you apologize.  No bull, no pity party.  You just say what needs to be said and you put in the work.  Thank you, I feel it was sincere.
Will , you obviously don’t know me but you were a big part of my childhood and I always felt a deep spiritual connection from you from watching you on the fresh prince of bel air . You honestly seem like a really good guy and I just hope that “ good guy “ image wasn’t a facade just for fame and to have people like you . U will always be a legend in my eyes
i was so disappointed in you but as a fan i forgive you and love you great man
No one asked
Ben a fan of Will Smith since the late 80s, bumping DJ Jazzy Jeff and The  Fresh Prince waaay back in the day and never stopped liking him however why did this apology take 3 months?
Thank you Mr. Smith, I will always respect you. We are all human thank you for the reminder self work is never ending. Your still an amazing role model.
I wish Elaine Stritch was still alive to deliver one of her best lines ever......  For anyone guessing, it's from Norm MacDonald's film,.Screwed, from1999. I think it would apply to this situation quite well.
Honestly I’m against discrimination and never felt you were completely wrong for your actions however I’d said this in a dm to you maybe a different reaction would have been better. Myself I don’t know how I would have handled such a situation. Will you are amazing, loved you since fresh Prince days and still do now. In fact I may just find myself a Will Smith film to watch rn.
We all make mistakes. That is how we grow as humans. I respect that you did realize what you did & for apologising of course it is nobody's place but Chris' to accept that apology & I pray that when he is ready ya'll can bury this & put it all behind you.
It was shoking...but your humen...your a powerfull man in all aspects. Its ok.
I have always been a fan of your work. Jesus forgave us. I as a Christian fan forgive you and hope that eveyone learns from what happened. Remember your roots and do not let Stardom ruin you. I pray for peace for all involved.
This Actor still Acting.. tryna get right before Bad boys huh 👍
Prayers going up for you Will. Give it some time and let the Lord work it out!!!🙏❤
we still love you, Will! mistakes happen but we just have to grow and keep moving ❤️
No matter how aggressive the media tried to question your character, I NEVER turned my back on you will. No one is perfect. You’re human, you made a mistake and I think the fans are always in your corner. I hope you and Chris can have that conversation someday. It doesn’t have to be public but I’d love nothing more than to see some reconciliation between you two. Much love to both of you. ✊🏾♥️
I never stopped being a fan or loving you Will Smith! I totally believe this apology is  very sincere!
I love you Will! Philly loves you too.
a lot of respect for this 👏 🇬🇧
His eyes show he is lying.
WILL just know you are loved❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This just gose to prove that everyone is human even actors
I resubscribed after this video, I really hope he meant what he said.
Can you move to a next country to carry on with your shows etc.
This man is an accomplished actor who at the top of his game made some pretty good movies. So, why does this feel so insincere?
🤝
Walking L
Lol
We all need to be allowed to make mistakes. That's how we learn. You won 2 awards that night. Best actor and Worst timing. It's good to finally see you again. We all grew up with you man.    Also, I see i need to buy your book if I want more perspective into the situation. I was gonna do that anyhow.
we appreciate you. <3
Good Actor
Love you and Chris,still. Hate it happened but this is a great apology. My hope for y’all is you get to have that conversation one day. Looking forward to what’s next💖
Walking L
Some of us do forgive you. Everyone makes mistakes. I have watched you grow since 1990. There has been a picture of you with an orange peel on your teeth, on my wall since I was 12 years old. You still deserve that spot. I’m happy you were humble enough to do this. You are still so very loved. 💖🕯
Things happen sometimes with regret, bad time and place for what occurred but we must all learn to forgive. As long as we have life we must keep putting our best foot forward. Will I am a fan and wish nothing but the best for you.
As global neighbors of Will, we have all done our rebuking. Let him correct his mistakes and grow and move forward.
We love you WILL!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I know that you will never see this but that’s ok I just want you to know that you are a good man and ever if we never see each other I will always consider you an old friend try and stay positive buddy.   With much love              An old friend
He should be in jail
Good video. We make mistakes (albeit not in front of that many people) and I would rather live in a world where people admit their mistakes and take account versus one where no one apologizes for anything and use whataboutisms to justify their actions.
You need to get rid of the toxic in your life  I think you know who I’m talking about 😏
Really Will?  Victim blaming? Is it really necessary to publicly announce that “Chris isn’t ready to talk yet”?  Seems like you just want to flip the switch & come off as the bigger man. Your “apology” should be to Chris & his family IN PRIVATE.
Waking L
We are humans and make mistakes. That moment was definitely out of character for you but thank you for apologizing. You never lost a fan, just got a worried one. Hope you are dealing with whatever you need to.
I still find it absurd that this man is getting so much backlash but no one bats their eyes at the racists and rapists there. Not to say his actions were respectable or shouldn't have repercussions but if we are holding will accountable all others need to be as well.
Thank you. ❤️
were are only human, life goes on and the best wecan do is forgive oneself and progress forward
All love ❤️
I really understand what you've been through, because from my point of view, in that day you was on the edge, that was the day you could win one of the most importants awards of your life and any bad word or thing another could say to you, could make you explode on rage, I clearly know that because that happened to me, and it was even worse in my point of view, because one day I was on the edge, everything on that day went wrong, I was about to explode, but unfortunately, it was my own mother who said the "wrong word", I've said terrible things to her in that day, things that I never had even said or write before, I made she cry because of it, she was my best friend and because of a compilation of factors, I threw my anger at her, and even if I didn't raised my hand against her, what I said, was even worse, but thanks to God, we've finally got over it, but yet, I still didn't ask for a apologize, because I think that after all, I didn't deserve that, but she gave me anyway
I’d reach out and give you a long hug if I could. It’s easy to see that you’re struggling with many things we all struggle with at one time or another.   I feel it’s our duty to see that in everyone around us or far away and pick each other up.   I’d like to tell you it’s okay, we’re going to learn, we’re going to grow, and we’re going to enjoy this blessing of life. Find meaning, do some good, and grow.   That’s all any of us SHOULD do.
Will, we miss you! And we're waiting for your come back. ALL LOVE from Brazil!!!
🤔
It was shocking to see you behave that way.  I have loved everything you've done.  You're human and we all screw up.  Thank you for doing this video.  Now let's all move on.  There are so many terrible things going on in our world today.  And this incident is insignificant in the greater scheme of things.  It's a big thing for you and had obviously hurt you.  When you can let it go, please do.  It's over.
Mr. Smith I commend you for this video, the work you’re doing on yourself, as well as the ownership and acknowledgment you’ve expressed of the situation.  To be honest, I was shocked and felt let down when I witnessed what happened.  However, I immediately knew your were clearly dealing with things internally that played a role in creating that reaction.  I haven’t been able to watch a movie of yours or listen to your music since.  My stomach turns when I try because I think of what happened.  When I feel that way, I’ve tried to remind myself that we are all human and all make mistakes.  Your silence until this point bothered me, but this is a big step.  So again I commend you.  Good luck in your journey and thank you for this video.
Perhaps you have enough funds to retire.  Most of us cannot afford this kind of behavior.  You should feel bad and apologizing is the right thing to do, but I also believe it is your time.  Buy yourself a small country and enjoy the rest of your life.  Become a "streamer" and share your thoughts on whatever you want to talk about; you will produce good shows, I can see that from the quality and dynamism of this video.  All the best.  I believe you learned your lesson; perhaps you are a fine fellow, but it is time.  Accept it.
Man, I’m still love you. My favorite actor forever. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has the right to forgiveness
Well said Will.
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Do another Men in Black with Tommy Lee Jones and we're good
Lmao this guy 🤣🤣🤣
Good job Will! I Applaud u for apologizing to everyone, and for being so transparent.👏👏 FORGIVE  yourself, Let yourself heal, Learn from this moment. Then move forward. God bless you!!
Well said. We all are human! Grace has been extended you are forgiven! Now thats! how you go High in my Mike Lowrey voice. Keep taming that Ego!
Everyone has there opinion of everything. Obviously that was wrong and you see what you did. I really am rooting for man. God bless.
No apology necessary, in my opinion. Have been watching your work and will continue to watch. Forever a fan. 💜
Thank you for apologizing
One mistake doesn’t ruin everything you’ve built! I’m glad to finally see a heartfelt apology to Chris from you and the work you’re putting in to improve.
Bots out in force today huh
Why the first frame in this video look like the set of Gordy’s home?
Being man enough to acknowledge when you’re wrong is a trait not often seen enough today, I hope they could make amends in the future.
Those who are without sin, let them cast the first stone. We all make mistakes and love is given regardless if others are perfect or not. We love you 💕
That was really uncomfortable to watch. The format chosen was terrible, it was meant to be a heartfelt apology and expressing of feelings, not an AMA on reddit. He sounds like he has to force some of the words out of his mouth. Like a hostage being held at gunpoint reading a prepared statement lol. I can't tell if he's full of shame or seething with anger.  But that was completely unnatural.
It takes a man to own up to his mistake.  It’s sad to see a broken man. Love can make good people do bad things.
Sad to see so many come out and turn their backs on Will Smith…glad that he spoke about this, on his time, after thinking…Still rooting for Will ❤
but I can say to all of you there is no part of me that thinks that was the right way ?! but Jane thinks it was the right way right?
This was very heartfelt. You are missed.
This video slam’s
Celebrity death match and call it a wrap lol
F the dumb stuff. You the Man Will. Still look up to you with all the BS. Let’s get jiggy wit it!
I still look up to Will, one bad day don't erase decades of good deeds, he is human and he is still a great person.
Glad to see no red table in sight 😌
beta
We are all human. Thank for doing this I know you did more for yourself then for us because we understand.  We appreciate you and we can move forward. Also when Chris is ready I hope all goes well.
Respect to will for saying he is sorry, you can see it in his eyes he means it.

For all we know the dude is reading cue cards. Maybe he is genuinely sorry. Maybe not. The trouble is we don't really know because he's an A-List actor who doesn't really mingle with the general public. I still love Will as an actor. But I can't make assumptions about who he is as a person.
Don’t vouch for your kids, they were hyping you up after you did it. They owe accountability too especially Jaden
The word sorry might not be enough but the process of sitting down to make the video. The courage it took is amazing. Anyone else would’ve said I did what I did and that’s that. But even if that’s how you felt, you decided to put other peoples feelings , opinions before your own. That speaks volumes and if Chris is ready I think we shall all be ready to move past this. One bad moment can’t blur the great person you’ve portrayed to be all these years. I say portrait because I don’t know you personally. But I do know you’ve impacted others in a good way more than bad. And we’re all here to grow. Bad moments create opportunities to do just that. GROWTH - God loves us unconditionally through good and bad. That’s the definition of true love.
I think we owe it to the victim to forgive him when Chris does.
PR team wrote this
Should edit the title lol. "Its", not "it's".
Everyone f*cks up in their life...you just happened to have done it on an internationally televised event...celebrities sadly have their mess ups & other personal sh*t highlighted around the globe all the time. You should not have done what you did,  Chris handled your mental breakdown pretty damn well. But, your not perfect & no one is, my man...this too shall pass...you'll be alright...and so will Chris. People need to just let you two privately handle your business & hopefully your friendship, if its a real one, will survive this.
Sounds like you're apologizing by not apologizing. Next time, try to say these things from your heart, not from a piece of paper.
Y dale con este tema... Ya nos habíamos olvidado de esto bro jajajajajj.
You are human contrary to popular belief.  And humans make mistakes. You are forgiven an completely loved by me.
Big Will welcome back. We hear you and accept you. We're not all perfect but we learn and grow from our mishaps. I'll continue to follow your journey through this thing called life.
How does this video have more likes than views?
I have long admired you and your career. For that to happen at such a pinnacle moment for you is terribly sad.  I believe every word you said here and personally forgave you the next day. You were an idiot. It happens. Real bad timing though and you cannot erase it. I totally hope you are serious about spreading light and joy from here on.... that would be a great thing.... but this stain isn't fading soon. It will mark your identity for a long time. That saddens me. I always liked you.  This video was excellent. Just go back to making movies. Make people laugh. Do a penance comedy tour. Teach some kids to dance. You are a mega-star and that hasn't changed. Thank you for this video.
Proud of you Will...My Philly Brotha
Love you. I can't believe they took so much from you. You're great Will. ❤🙏🏾❤🙏🏾❤🙏🏾❤🙏🏾❤.
We all have bad days and moments, it’s life, you made a mistake and it’s commendable that you are willing to rectify what happened! You didn’t have to do it for us, the millions of fans/naysayers/people, it’s between you and Chris so whenever Chris is ready to sit down with you then both of you should be able to move forward! Love y’all both!
We love you Will! And God loves you too 🙏🏾
You made a mistake. So what we all make mistakes. Yours is just magnified because you’re in the public eye. You said my bad so it is what it is.
Weak boy in a man’s body 🤣🤣
👍
We still with you Will!
forget it, Are you not a human being?
Thank you Mr.Smith. I appreciate that you have invested much thought into the situation. Being a decades long fan; I feel you have gained some redemption by your statement. I hope soon other folks can reach clarity and come to terms with their feelings. As a parent with two young children, I look forward to showing them you ARE a human who embraces their actions and can address their mistakes. I wish you the best in furthering peace for all parties.
As you said we are all human we all make mistakes and it took a lot of courage and bravery to post this video and I know that you will grow from it and learn from it and that you will bring light and joy back into the way things are before
Sorry but this seems like a publicity stunt he got black balled for this now he wants back. Don't come for me. We are allowed to feel differently
We all make mistakes
This was a grown man apology nothing but respect for him
Why does this feel ingenuine? Is it just me? Well done with the sponsoring by the way😂
why did you go the after party and danced like nothing happened? It showed the real you. After all this time, You are now making this speech to woo the audience so you can continue making movies and money.  Convince me if i am wrong.
Thank you Brother, Be Well. Take Care of Yourself...we gon be alright. You are loved.
ur insane
I’ve always loved and respected you and still do. We all make mistakes and that’s okay. 🤍 can’t wait for your awesome videos
Yes people make mistakes but in my opinion he waited too, too long. He knew exactly what he was doing when he did it.
will we still love you bro we all make mistakes. The best thing to do is to own up to your mistakes and move forward
Not long enough! Go AWAY!!!
Nmmnaaaahhh you lost me dude, all the best… I ain’t watching any of your movies no matter how much much I loved them before.  The damage you have done to comics and their ability to have free speech can’t be fixed…
Yeah.   No.
I felt really hurt for Chris daughters more than anything. That was his manhood being challenged and kids are friggin cruel. I still love you Will. We all have to do better,❤️
Yo is it me or is this just an ad for his WATER company. I dont know will not our place to listen to you apologise this should be left between you and chris noone else. Releasing this video and apology is a PR stunt plain and simple.
Being remorseful without being ashamed requires so much work and mental fortitude. It’s a lesson we all need to learn and something to try our best to master!
We still love you will! ❤️
PEOPLE ARE NOT THEIR WORST MISTAKE
Damn, left the comments open. Respect
Apology Accepted, Career Over
U should be ashamed
Here's a thought. Ask for forgiveness. Say, "I am so sorry, will you please forgive me?" Asking for forgiveness creates a genuine opportunity for reconciliation, and establishes a two way dialogue between the offender and the offended. Asking forgiveness is very difficult. You will be humbled and vulnerable but, it is the most genuine and sincere way to apologize to someone. It provides the offended an opportunity, a choice, to actively participate in the apology and respond to your request for forgiveness. The offended party might not respond right away, but if they choose to never respond, it's on them now. You've sincerely done all you can do to reconcile and begin to heal the hurts. Positive vibes for you and Chris, and other who were affected.
Happens. Talk to Chris. If he doesn't want to, still keep trying. You cannot apologize enough. It was bad, but that's not your whole life. It is also time to move on. Try and become a better person. Good luck!!!
28,000 views with 32,000 "likes". You wut m8?
Not genuine and beyond pathetic.....
I have always said that no one becomes a better person without making mistakes, as long as they admit, accept and learn from them.   We are not robots, we are human beings, imperfect from birth to death, we all make mistakes, but not everyone apologizes, not everyone tries to make amends, and that is the difference between a good person and a bad person.   Will Smith, you are a good person. 🙏❤️
I hear your pain, I know it’s sincere. We as people should be able to forgive like our higher power does. 🙏🏽 God bless you!
Love you Will. I think it was really smart to wait and work on yourself before talking about the incident again. I can tell that you are still trying to reconcile with your actions and how they impacted everyone, but also trying to not develop self hate for making a mistake. Thank you for the video and I hope that you and Chris can work this out. I think once you both can heal, so can everyone else effected by it.
Well, it's good to see Will making an effort to mend things.  It definitely helps my opinion of  Will which is kind of tarnished from this incident.  I hope Chris will forgive Will Smith and we can all move past this.
WILL SMITH no one is perfect but God. In fact ALL have & will fall short. Ask God for forgiveness, forgive yourself & Keep your head up!
Telling sorry never makes you low expecting your mistake is good for you and your fans like me.
I already let it go. you my guy
Much respect Will for taking the time to sincerely apologize. We still love you ♥️
We're all a work in progress, my friend. I'm learning to forgive (self) sooner, love (self) sooner and keep being (YOU) MAN. Stay Blessed & #keepinspiring #TLMEDIA
Good apology IMO but why does it have 5k more likes than it does views?
Your not a bad guy , we all fall down at times , it's how we pick ourselves up that matters , make a decision to put it behind you.
Will, you were definitely wrong for what you did. But it was a mistake. A human mistake. You've been in the public eye since you were what, 16? And you went from then until now at 53 to have a major misstep. You're far from a POS, brother. You had a bad moment, but it wasn't a character defining one by any means. This isn't me letting you off the hook, so to speak. But rather, me viewing this transgression within its proper perspective.  It's easy for everyone to cast stones when we're not the ones under the revealing glare of the spotlight. But I wonder how many of us would have made it from 16 to 53 before having our first major public misstep? Just saying.  God bless, my brother. Stay strong.
Why should will Smith have to apologize!!!!!!! Why????? He was defending his woman..... First time in my life I'm happy not being a rich black man.... Chris, how about defending your fellow man and acknowledge why he did it and come out and help him out!
forever lost my respect
Will needs to let soy go from his diet man. Damn...only a woman can change a man like this.
Here’s the thing. For those who say, he needs to just stop working… wow. For those who say it’s to late and you don’t care. You are exactly what’s wrong with this world. You are someone who has made many mistakes in your life and needed to be forgiven. You are someone who failed and needed redemption. So I pray kindness love and forgiveness was not extended to you since you are unwilling to extend to others and for that matter thinks no one is redeemable then you are not as well. For those who can say rather it be honestly or in denial of truth that you never made a mistake you still will be judge harsher then the sinners of the world for the lack of forgiveness in your heart. Where there is no sinner cast the first stone.
The first of many steps that need to take place. Keep going. Atone no matter what.
You are human and you are not perfect! Everyone makes mistakes, bad judgment calls...whatever you want to call them. We all have made mistakes but, when we sit in the seat of judgment we seem to forget that! Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us and for addressing the questions.
What happened was unfortunate. But this is how you own up, apologize and make amends. You’re an exceptional man and this just reiterates that. I’m still a fan brotha, we still need you and want you. Thank you for doing the work and I hope this brings clarity, understanding and healing.
I admit I was disappointed with your behavior that night. However, I respect the sincerity of your words and your desire to make things right while working on your past hurts. It takes a strong man to be willing to do that. Keep doing the work - you'll find true peace in that. It'll all be ok in the end.
Hi Will, just watch this video here in brazil with my mom, we are huge fans since ever, we never stop loving you. Thank you so much for this video and we wish you lots of love in your journey.
Are you doing this because you have a new project coming out or are you really sorry?
Still apologizing to the woman who put his life miserable. Pathetic
We are human and emotions get get best of us thats for sure. Never changed my perspective of you ever. There are no sides to this for me. I hope everyone can move on peacefully
I love you so very much Will. Your courage is emerncely inspirational and humbling.... You are loved. ❤️
Will Smith for president. It has to happen
Off switch.. Everything that was Will smith went abracadabra in my eyes....can't play the hand games in the real life..people dying from less..
What? Lol
Blink if you are doing this or being held against your will.😅  You are good, don't listen the crying babies.
We are not perfect. We all make mistakes. Your body of work is beautiful and your still a beautiful human being. I still look up to you. You have spoken words in the past that changed my life. Thank you.
My question now is for all the woman who supported what Will did, what do you have to say? He openly admitted was wrong and his actions were wrong. So many woman said that is what they would want there man today, praising his actions. Now that he admits he was wrong, how do you woman who thought and felt he was right feel about this?
It's alright will no hard feelings from a fan here, we all mess up sometime
Sending my love to you!❤️
Proud of you, missed you, and have been praying for you!
😶 i'll be here for the reflection  "...we will be able to friends again.." Time heals.
Te amamos saludos y bendiciones desde Puerto Rico 🇵🇷👍😘😍🙋🏻‍♀️
None of these questions came to my mind... like Dave Chappelle said 'I see myself in both of you'....You and Chris are the best in this business.  I am happy that you are fine. As one of your fans I haven't changed towards you because like you said you are a human like us and we all make mistakes.  It is between you and Chris... and Chris doesn't deserve what happened to him. Hope things get better.
Not buying it..... your money ain't coming in like it should. That's why your "apologizing". All your projects getting put on the back burner.
You need to focus on yourself right now, Will. Make sure you're doing well and taking care of yourself. I'm not gonna lie what you did was pretty bad, however actions speak louder than words and while I respect you for putting up this video and being honest, people can tell if your actually putting in the work. So can yourself feel that change over time. Find an outlet for negative emotions, stress, and sadness I don't care if it's therapy, counseling, anger management, or physical activities. Constantly talking down to yourself isn't going to help the situation and will break you down psychologically, so I'm glad your not doing that too.
I've always knew you were a stand up human. Keep it jiggy!
we love u will
Gross
Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy 5:36
i was curious today as to where the whole situation was cus i havent heard abt it in a while but then he uploaded a vid abt lol, the timing
Oh ya real funny
Well said sir
Where is the actual “I am sorry”? Seems like he is still playing the victim
More memes thank you will
The ones who truly like/love will didnt think for a second that this will make them stop. Nobody perfect and people with sense understand that and you was defending your family you could never knock a man for that Idc what nobody says
I have watched you on TV and the Big Screen since I was a little girl... I was so disappointed by your actions against Chris. Not just that, I felt so bad for Serena and Venus. They worked so hard Will...   It could have been water off a duck's back as they say...  However, I do not forget that you are a human being with real emotions. I am happy to see that you have apologized to those you've hurt, a positive first step.  It will be wonderful to see the growth from this point forward.   I personally will always adore you and you will still be that childhood Hero I always and still look up to... With Love. O.
Well said sir
Always have been and will be a Will Smith fan 💙🙏🏽
We still LOVE YOU WILL!! It's not easy being a man let alone being a man in your shoes. God bless you. Your still my idol bro.
It takes a lot of courage to admit a mistake. Taking public accountability is necessary. It seems like Will has done the work on this one. I think he has learned his lesson so he never has to make another video like this
Hey Will, thank you for always doing your best as a human being. I know you will get past this. That experience was a setback, but you will bounce back. You're still the great man we fell in love with.
🙏👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏 Great job🙏
It is OK, Will!!  It will all be OK.  #weRallHuman
not that complex
Welcome back will
Very bald video. I mean bold.
I, for one, will always see Smith as a bully.  He's a big man, and he sure beat down hard on a guy much smaller than him.  It won't matter to him that what respect I had for him has now gone.
You have been a part of my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. I'm always rocking with you, Will! Keep your head up. Don't let these people tear you down. You made a mistake, and you owned up to it. Takes a really brave soul to show humility with courage like you do. I love you Will and the whole Smith family!
I hope you come through this on top
We are all human, we've all made decisions that we later wish we could take back..To judge you would take away any humanity we would want given to any of us under similar situations
Welcome to Miami
Ab pachtaye hot kya jab chidiya chug gayi khet...... Its okay...
Divorce that demonic soul woman
I know you’ve been takin a lotta heat my man but there’s always gonna be people that expect too much from celebrities. Y’all are human and make mistakes. Much love goes out to you man I hope you find the peace and healing you seek. Fan for life here.
I hope you can truly find the source of your insecurities and anger and leave it all behind you to become a better you.
No one should be so quick to pass judgment that we forget our own shortcomings. It is often too easy to point out other people's issue without considering our own first. 1 finger pointing out somone's flaws still leaves 3 fingers pointing back at our own. We are all IMPERFECT people trying to make it through the journey of life but few of us have had to deal with our mistakes being broadcast on such a public scale. Will, I applaude you for stepping up to do the best you can to make this right! The timing or delay as some may see it has to be respected as what YOU needed to genuinely address what is probably one of the biggest challenges of your life. Keep striving to the best version of yourself each day my brother! Always a fan, still a fan and understand that your are human and therefore subject to all of the flaws and imperfections that come along with the human condition!
Love you Will Smith! You guys will work this out. Nothing but love for you. 🙏🏾💕🥰
Am I the only one hoping this opened up with the YouTube rewind Will smith intro?
If Will was white, 3/4 of the comments on here backing Will would be calling him a racist who committed a hate crime therefore apologizing won’t help.  Y’all KNOW I’m right so take your hypocrisy elsewhere
Super proud of you! All is well now!!!
It's been 3 months... Not a f'n minute....  Your time has expired bro...
after 3 months???
I want to believe him, truly, but I have two concerns here: first, and simplest, he really doesn't answer the first question. Given that this is recorded and edited, there's no reason to choose a question and then dodge it. Second, and more, the repeated references to 'what happened' rather than what 'I did' - begs the question whether he's taking ownership of the attack or just trying to make sense of its aftermath.
You'll come through this. We all make mistakes. I still believe in you and admire your work as it is all to be commended. This too shall pass. Stay strong!!
This looks more like a celebrity interpretation of a YouTube Apology video. Still bad. Lmao XD
I truly believe everything happens for a reason.  My mother always taught me.  There’s only 2 situations in life.  Good situations and learning situations.    All the forgiveness from Chris, your family, and fans doesn’t mean anything until you forgive yourself.
Crazy
He is a great actor and I don't buy it. If he is willing to do this in front of millions, imagine what he does in private. He assaults people that say things he doesn't like. I will no longer support anything he does.
So many bots in the comments.
Mistakes happen and I will always be able to forgive. I'm still one of your biggest fans, Will.
Let me help you with letting people down /They should be putting their trust in you like that but God in the first place your welcome/ i hope your trauma is more about trust with the Lord broken🙏🏽🫶🏽
This happens in all aspects of life. We do in the moment and repercussions happen. We should never be afraid to embrace them and learn to move on. I hope that Peace Dove for a chat happens 🕊
Hey man, what are you talkin about.. We are still friends man..luv u
Takes a real man to do this love you will ❤️
Everyone makes mistakes man. It was a big one because it was so out of character based the person we all believe you to be. Still we make mistakes. I think you will better from this for sure. You are a good man that made a big mistake not OJ mistake but a mistake nonetheless.
He doesn't seem like the same guy at all, almost like he did too much LSD or something. He's weird now
Grande Will!!! As always man. I hope the heat fade away and you come back to the silver screen bigger than ever before.
Hmm…
You were Wrong, Very wrong. But this is the first step...
Im so glad to see you again. You are human we all make mistakes. The key is learning from the mistakes to be a better you. Much love and peace to you and you family.
He better make an effort besides sitting in front of a camera reading a script. He makes it sounds now like Chris has to reach out to him.
Well ....I'm glad you and Chris are working things out... Chris well forgive you...he has a good heart..... respect youth.....big up brethren...yes hyah....😎👍🇯🇲
Please don’t stop being yourself!! You are amazing, we are humans and we make mistakes. People act like they never done something like this or worst in their lives.   Will stay strong you will be my hero and I   Will Continue watch anything that you do!!!
I hope Chris reaches out to soon and maybe u guys can make a comedy movie..lol..someday 😎
Will ALWAYS be a Will Smith fan.  The Rovk family are good people and I pray they can forgive you. Most importantly,  you MUST forgive yourself.  It is so important for you to do that so that you can be who you truly are at the core...a good man full of light, love, and gifts to give the world. I love the Smith family for life, flaws (and we are have them) and all. Much love, much respect!!
He should had been taken out from the event
Nothing but respect for you Will that was a grown MAN MOVE!!
Africa loves you❤️❤️❤️
Nice product placement for “water”.
Why….are you…. talking…..like this… the whole….interview…. ? 😂Dude you lookin like a bozo. I can’t tell if this makes you look better or worse… and when questlove was finally going to get in award after 30 years of his work. God forbid you let the man have his moment 🤦‍♂️😂
the world loves you, Will. Npbody's perfect, and you're an amazing man!
Mistakes can be made right, but excuses from the very beginning - not the most effective solution. #teamwork #accountability
now that there were consequences lmao
Love
We still love u man
Tbh after a month most people moved on but it’s good that Will apologized and admitted he was wrong.
Doing the right thing by "OWNING IT"
Great Job Will💯 We All Love You Brother‼️
A relationship based on lies is no relationship at all. When you said: “love makes you do crazy things” are you aware that is a line domestic abusers & narcs use to deflect & project? I hope you will donate to DV shelters and become a voice for men getting therapy & anger management. Also: being an Oprah minion is problematic…are you aware of the damage that interview caused as well? Being human & making a giant, global mistake deserves shame. Shame keeps us in check. Toxic shame makes you hide & lie. Regular, healthy, HUMAN shame is about having a conscience.  Become more transparent about EVERYTHING. Then? Respect will be restored. Until then? This is just egoic damage control.
Good for the apology but I remember the shock Chris had on his face.. For someone I had the utmost respect for thats gone for me
Not surprised most of the comment section is people on your nutsak. Smh no respect. He should've rushed you with your back turned.
Bro I may not be in ur shoes or feel how u felt on tht night when this happened to you but coming out off all this drama an pain its f... up many ppl will say all what they wanna say but Noone appsaloty noone  feel or no how u feel. Some ppl may or would hv Dan it worst than u. At the end off the day u will be hated on u will be loved on u jus keep ur head high an keep moving forward our emotions sometimes can really take the best off us an sometimes we lash out without even thinking off the out come many off us hear hv all been thought it at some point in our lives. But I'm jus glad u came out an apologize.
You always put light love and joy into the universe. Everyone has lost their temper at some point in life. I know what it's like to be demonized because I lost my temper. sending you love Will.
We love you 💜
🤡
I love you, Will !!! God bless you and much support
Allah who came in The Person of Master Fard Muhammad loves you, Brother Will.  And so does The Nation of Islam.   Keep climbing your mountain. Rest when you need to. Take a drink of water when you’re parched, and continue your assent! Insha’Allah, you’ll reach the top with the Help of Almighty God, Allah!  And when you do, rejoice. ♥️  Because His Mercy is so sweet!
I love the sponsorship water bottle placement 😒😒
I love you Will! I’m pulling for you, for your family, and for your future! Rise!
Will has been squeaky clean for as long as I’ve been alive LOL! To see this man make a poor choice in public and then have a heart of repentance and take full responsibility for his actions says a lot about his character. There’s a TON to learn from this man and from this microcosm of a situation.
Miss fresh prince
You made a mistake, above all you are human and I am patiently awaiting for the time when you are ready to share with us and be our friends again.  I did not stop looking up to you because of what happened.
I still respect you. Mistakes happen.
First I would like to start off by saying if our lives were on display 24/7 all of us would have a moment that we are not proud of. Please leave this man alone as he has apologized already we are all human at the end of the day and I am still a fan of yours Will.
You're awesome, keep moving forward. We love you. I'm more concern about how are "You" doing. And hope you are getting help and don't let your high IQ over talk the help. You'll be ok.
Takes a real man to apologize. All love Will! Respect!✌️❤
I love you Will no homo my favorite actor since I was a kid.. I see how your bashed all the time forget the haters.. and yea you may have overreacted.. but people put you and your family  in the spotlight for the wrong reasons these last couple of years.. and it’s cool to say your tired of it.. because you’ve always been a positive role model and still are and you don’t get enough recognition💯❤️
Still much respect and love for you. I know this is hard but we are here and when your movies come out I will be there too.❤️
His history with Chris. Did he and Chris have a problem that would make him wanna smack him?
With a whole camera crew...
Will’s a real one…us Millennials love you bro, unconditionally…you helped raise us…along with Chris….that’s why we got to come together in this
You saw my post? Missed you!
Feels like he’s genuinely sorry and remorseful.   Glad he put this out. I think he will recover from this.
You have my continued respect, Will. You’ve never lost it. Ever. You are my favorite. Always have been since I was little and you will be as I grow old. You deserve good things, sir
Yeah, but you fkd Chris on the universal spotlight.  Some things can yes be forgiven, but NEVER forgotten.  This is the price that one must pay and yes the damage that has been done is irreparable.   When this type of shyt happens to some people it's not as easy as just saying, "I'm sorry".  #facts
I hate that you feel the need to keep apologizing for what happened. All this makes me feel like kids in a playground. A kid behaves in the most obnoxious and insulting way possible but never touches you, then you touch them and hurt them in a different way but suddenly only your aggression is harmful. No one cares about what caused your behaviour.  "Disrespect" doesn't define what Chris said. "It's humor" doesn't justify standing up in front of an audience and offending someone's illness to their face. I'm not saying what you did is okay. What I'm saying is what Chris said was just as harmful.
My home town bro forever. Proud of you man....you made a bad choice and you owned it !! Looking forward to greater things from you soon .......Peace !!
31k like 26k views yeah seems legit
Why did it take all this time for you to apologize? You didn’t look remorseful at the after party that night
Will, you will move pass this. You're apology is sincere and honest
Scripted! Not sincere!
Love you Will. I think we all understand where you were coming from even if it doesn’t make it acceptable. I don’t shame you for what you did because many people forget that you are human. I’m always here if you ever need me even though I doubt that. Keep your head up, please.
*WILL --  "Forgiveness is not weak, it takes courage to face and overcome powerful emotions." ...Desmond Tutu*
Meh
I still love you man,enjoying your nice music and your movies,keep it going dude
Hey Will, I do respect you  a lot!! But the glass is already broken, no matter how you glue it back, that little crack will always be present!! And yes we are all humans no matter how healthy is your wallet, but we are all accountable for our actions! So now the only thing to do is to go on and make every not for granted and do best actions around US humans!!
En tant que téléspectateurs, j’accepte vos excuses Monsieur Smith. Merci et je pourrai maintenant regarder le canal D sans malaise (Canada). Salutations de Montréal.
Welcome back, Will!  Thanks for sharing.🖤
Will Smith, you're human and we all make mistakes. You're taking responsibility, ownership and doing the work. Everyone involved I hope can forgive and get back to a good place with each other.  Before anyone in the public, media or fellow entertainers say something negative.  We all have made mistakes or done something wrong but ours wasn't on display/tv. Some have got caught doing worse and you all still love them til this day. Will you messed up BUT you're on the right path. 👍🏾🙏🏾
💜
I love you will you’re a good man that made mistake you are human like all of us 🙏🏾❤️
Welcome back, Will! You were missed.  I’m glad you are back.  Thank you for helping me overcome, recognize, identify and explain some things I personally have experienced.
It’s ight make bad boys 4
THE KING IS BAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCK
Gooooood-ah-Jawwwb
Never left you. Its like I tell people when they ask how I feel/ felt when my daughter came out as PAN in her senior yr of high school. You same today as yesterday. Human. Keep up the Good Work. Loves ❤️
kEPP ALL THESE WORDS OUT OF Your MOUTH!!
It's over.the magics gone.. so sad
Remember he didnt make this apology alone. This is purely to save him
bla bla blaaaa
Thanks for this. I appreciate your vulnerability and respect the journey of trying to get it right rather than being right. Your courage to publicly share your imperfections normalizes it for others who've never seen it done before.
I feel you 100%. I still have your back homie……. Stay strong 💪🏾
Nice publicity work. 👌
Will made a mistake. We all make mistakes one day. Smaller or bigger. Sometimes life defining mistakes. It doesn't have to be that way for Will. He didn't make a horrific crime to lose movie or television projects. He has a lot more to offer.
You are loved. You are an extension of I. You are forgiven, I do hope you've forgiven yourself.
Unfortunately we make mistakes, but we can learn from them and try to right the wrongs. I wish you good luck on righting this. You didn't lose respect from me. We are human.
Proud of you will.  Just kidding,  YouTube isn’t letting any negative comments so this edit is the only way to share it.  Like you said Will,  irreparable
Thank you, Will, for taking back control of your life after losing it for a second. You’re no less a human than any of us, and this shows that you are.
Great apology. On YouTube that's a rare breed.
I Always got love for Will 💯🙏🏿
Just sending love and support.  Everyone makes mistakes.  This is a great step towards healing and understanding.  Let's extend this brother some grace.
Guys, there's a ton of movies that need to be made. That's why he's gonna go on a apology tour. Personally think this guy is detestable. He used to Preach the things he did. These celebrities are weirdos.
I respect this, Seems very Sincere ,Grown man Apology to Chris and his Family .bless both Parties . Make it Right  Lets Move on
This is just sad all around. Hate to see what Chris had to go through and hate seeing Will go through this.
We forgive you
This was hard to watch. Just know you are so loved and respected STILL .His Grace is sufficient for us all! This mistake does not diminish your extraordinary character,reputation and career !
Good job will !! That’s all I’ll say we love you
Love you and you weren't that wrong
I think this dude needs to take some time off... its ok dude, no ones is perfect.. re evaluate your relationships and surround yourself with people who actually care for you
It takes a man to step up, admit when he is wrong and will you did that.  Hopefully Chris reaches out to you and fences can be mended
Accountability, humility, introspection, evolved consciousness, sincerity and true remorse…..beautiful💜
I didn’t think I would watch this video.  I didn’t want to see or hear anything from Will Smith BUT I did watch and I’m glad I did.  All I could think of during the video was how many times I made terrible choices or made mistakes in my life.  How thankful I was to be able to get a second chance or learn and move forward.  I truly believe Will in what he has said.  This can be a teachable moment for all or us!  Not what happened but how we chose to respond to it and what we ALL do moving forward.  I admire Will’s vulnerability and sincerity.  I wish them both well.
The unfortunate part is you're an actor, and a very good one. So it's hard to believe you're truly remorseful for your actions, and not just acting to try and save what little face, and career you have left. I truly hope you're sincere.
Valid 🙂👍
Too early
God loves you will we not perfect The world 🌍 has FORGIVEN YOU WE LOVE YOU WILL SMITH
Forgive but not forget
Love you Will ❤️
I don’t accept his apology, it’s not genuine. He is putting up a show and you can tell by his tone and body language.   You are not giving an acceptance speech Mr Smith, you are apologising. What you did was criminal and you should have been arrested for your criminal actions. You would do best not to ever show your face anywhere if you are truly sorry. Somehow, I doubt that’s the message here. You are trying to move on but we are not going to, at least I’m not going to. You made me lose respect for a man that I sincerely admired, that man was you Mr Smith.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Respect to you great message and please dont disrespect someone like that ever again i hope chris and you will eventually get trough it
nice product placement 🤨
We have all done things we deeply regret and can never make right. As one human to another, I extend my forgiveness for whatever that's worth. I hope you will be able to reconcile with Chris soon.
It’s okay Will. Things like this happens the only thing we can do is forgive and move on. We all know you’re a great man that was pushed over the edge. It could’ve been anyone, but it’s okay man. It is okay my guy.
Don't be so hard on yourself, you have extended an apology to Chris, it is now in his hands.  The fact that you extended a public apology reaffirms that you are a good person, most people would just walk away.  On a lighter note, you are my favorite STAR.  Blessings from Grama Gugg.
I get why you made this video but it has just come off really awkward and not genuine. Been a huge fan since Fresh Prince but you should of apologized way sooner. shouldn't of taken this long just to say sorry to Chris
Apologizing won't weaken you it'll make you feel good, relieved and it'll strengthen your character ..... you did well Will you can start over now 🙏🏿.
I love Will and always his fan.
SALUTE!!
I forgive you Will. We all have moments out of character. People will scrutinize this video but I know where it’s coming from. You are a great person and entertainer and judging by the other comments you have a lot of support! Good Luck Will!
❤️🙏
Honest and sincere ❤ And when you said, "I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself" - it shed light on a personal situation of my own. Thank you. 🙏 All will be well in time. People still have your back. 💚
Nice acting Will. You are an actor after all
Thank you Will. Be well 🙏🏿
This world of social media and making everyone happy is toxic…let’s move on to the important things in life like our climate and if we will even be alive with all the turmoils in this world
Still love and  respect you
This man is hurting and he fucked up in public. I don't know what was going on in his world or in his mind at the time but I hope he is able to reach peace and happiness, us all too. Life is hard without a manual. ♥
LOL okkkkkkk
I cared about what you did will. But you have my support all day, every day. You’re always been my favorite actor. The best. Your a awesome and humble human being.  And what’s funny is that I just finished watching I Am Legend. Thank God for Will Smith.
Ok
Why is this all about how he feels?! He should be ashamed of himself.
We forgive you Will❤❤❤
Oh come on, classic dishonest YouTube apology. Admitting to a mistake is one thing, but that doesn’t undo the mistake. Cool, you don’t need to be crucified. But this is the bare minimum, not something to be applauded and then rewarded.
We all make mistakes... that's all I could say.
Don't be ashamed, Will. You are a role model. Despite of that moment. There's a lot of kindness in your actions and words. You inspire so many people around the world.  Hope you can continue in your path of healing and growing.   Lots of love from Brazil 🙏🏼💕🇧🇷
Ahhh that's hot... that's hot!
Will Smith your one of my favorite actors but you seem to be in a toxic environment. I know you want to maintain your family but they all seem to not value you from the outside.
I'm hanging with you.✝️🙏💜💙 We've all made MISTAKES but unfortunately yours were on the world stage. Thank you for the video, it helps. Our community in the Arts, is a small one so it's important to protect it. Please forgive yourself, and know that your fans have forgiven you as well. Hold on, and hold your head high. You will get through this...for the better. 💙💜💙
I was one of the very few people on Twitter speaking out against will and saying he was wrong, I ended up getting a lot of backlash for it but still stood my ground. However, after seeing this video I actually feel a bit bad for him. It’s clear he’s been under immense stress with his marital issues constantly being in the tabloids and seems to still be struggling with trauma from his childhood. I know he’s a celebrity but he’s also human and I personally feel like people should cut him some slack. We don’t know what it’s like to have our personal business out in the media so we really can’t judge his reaction to all this
You totally removed all the attention away from Questlove and Sam Jacksons lifetime award...
We still love you Will
Is this fake? That doesn't even look like Will. I'm still waiting on the REAL apology from the ACTUAL Will Smith, not some phony
Good job with addressing the situation and taking responsibility form your actions.
I forgive you Will even if chris doesn't. You are a great guy n i love thee.
I forgive you, and I think everyone who is human would say the same, asking for forgiveness and admitting the mistake is what makes you a better human being, making mistakes makes you human and admitting it and working to be better will make you a better human being, keep going cheer up and do not stop acting and doing what you do.
I still love ya Will and yes we human and make mistakes and may God continue to keep blessing you and as it goes this too shall pass....blessings my brotha💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏
You need to get rid of that toxic wench.
Forgiveness is essential in this world.  ✨️ ❤️❤️❤️
We love you and we've missed you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Much love and respect toward you before as well as after the incident. Salute
He smells lawsuit! Will is a coward forever in my eyes.
Too little too late
Everybody makes mistakes, ignore the noise the people have always been with you and are still with you.
Ummm is that the Just Water bottle in the background? Weird time to advertise I think?
Let go all your hurt and forgive yourself.
Weird that you use ‘I apologize’ for Chris’s people and ‘I’m sorry’ your family.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Honestly it’s good to see that your like the rest of us we act we live we make mistakes and we work on fixing our reckage great job young man
He genuinely looks sorry
Will Smith Is Still My Guy!!!! I Still Got Mad Luv For Will💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾✊🏾
This man clearly needs help. Making this video months after it happened isn’t gonna help anything.  Figure your stuff out separate from the public.
Will u still my mans…💯 everything will be fine one day 🙌🏾
What’s with the orb behind his head and also let’s plug my son’s water while we at it
He made a mistake. He is remorseful. Everyone should move on.
I grew up off Big Willie style , always wanted to go to UCLA, your life inspired mine sine I read your first book. You pretty much my dad lol 😂, we need to hangout sometime ! Remember JESUS AND THEMOSTHIGH, care for you
Lekker boeien
Free Will Smith
It wasn't a great choice but, we all stumble and get tripped up in the action of life. I have grown up with you and have always felt a connection even though we know nothing of each other. Your human and we all make mistakes. Rooting for a healing embrace with your friend Chris.
Took him this long to apologise and he is only doing it because of how far he is into the public's eye. Maybe he should actually go to chris and apologise. Not address the internet and apologise to chris as a side note on a youtube video
Mistakes happen. We realize them and we move forward. Do people have to accept apologies? We hope they do, but they don't have to. But, there comes a time where we need to look at what we've done and know we can only acknowledge it and move on. Have love and peace within yourself.
Will, do everything you can do, humanly possible to get past this. I  am not making  light of the situation but you are human. Please take care of yourself. I  don't know you personally but I do know you are a person with a good heart. Remember that and keep your head up. This too shall pass. Blessings now and always 🙏
I pray God heals both of these men and restores that relationship
A little too late for me. But better late than never
Nah that last line was ill. 🤣🤣🤣
You lost my respect tbh. I thought you were a changed man.
"No part of me thinks this was an appropriate reaction.". Therefore, Will was possessed and none of this is his fault.  Also, I'm not sorry --I'm remorseful and regret my actions.  This is PR playbook 101.  Which makes me think none of it is genuine.
Happy Juneteenth!
Will really apologizing to them white ppl. Bro do not gotta keep explaining himself
Our actions, good or bad, say a lot about our state of mind.
F this.  An apology should have already happened.  i understand that he is trying to do the right thing here but idc how famous or rich u think u r that is unacceptable.
I appreciate how humbled this apology was. It wasn't celebrity. It was arrogance. Just a human being expressing remorse. We all make mistakes. Learn and grow.
It takes a real man, a strong man to do this video. Kudos to you . We all make mistakes 🙏🏽
This is probably the best apology/follow up vid I've seen in a while. I hope he can find forgiveness.
I know it was a bit too far on the stage. But Will is  human being...
don't try and throw the onus on him by saying you're waiting for him to come talk, what reason does he have to ever talk to you again? you're right, it's irreparable, valuable life lessons aren't cheap or easy and the repercussions never fade away. good luck moving forward, you seemed like a decent guy
Respect
What I realised about forgiveness is people can forgive you and that will make you feel happy in a way but then you are left with yourself. How do you forgive yourself? This is what I found hard for me and it sucks because you keep dragging yourself to a place you shouldn’t continue to be at. I pray that both Chris and Will find a way to heal and are able to move on from this in a healthy way, a way that doesn’t hurt the inner person. May God touch their hearts and never let go.
Money is getting dry and lesser, no acting job. Desperate for money.  This is just an act and fake apologise. What a psychopath
Will I still support you. This took a lot for you to do. ☺️
We’ve all messed up…but we don’t all apologise or acknowledge our mistakes 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Humans make mistakes and grow through them. Those who don't understand that, probably have still many to make and will eventually understand. Hopefully.   ❤️
Look at his eyes. Like there is no joy in them no more. Looks like a man in grief.
Will, your heartfelt comments are heard and appreciated.  We wish you the very best in your journey on this road and when most of us are 100% honest, we've all been there, in some form.  #accountability #love
dont worry dude, we still love you man
If I was Chris, I would tell you to take your public video and shove it up your, you know what.
one admittedly LARGE mistake isnt going to ruin my decades of admiration and support of you will
You have always been the person that always inspired me. The shows,movies,event,and messages that you have made always lifted me up when I was down. You are a genuine person and as humans we mess up. It takes a big person to go on media and admit you were wrong. I respect that!
Glad to see you back 🤗 Sincerely hope you're doing well/ good 🙏🏿
You’re incredible. Accountability is where true honor lives. Thanks for taking the first couple steps. May you be transformed and may there be healing for all parties involved.
“Ayo make sure you get a good angle”
Will Smith can just go away already.
I think the world should just move on now!
love you man.
Before going out in public to try to rehabilitate your image you should have reached out directly to Chris and his family immediately after your outburst. You alone caused this, not Chris. Your intolerance caused this, not Chris. Your arrogance caused this, not Chris. Stop blaming it on “fog” or other platitudes and accept that you physically attacked a stand-up guy just because you didn’t like something  he said, what kind of “tolerance” is that??? Go hide behind your millions and teams of press agents and play the Hollywood game of fake friendships and feelings.

It was a mistake. No one knows what let you to it, and if they walked in your shoes they would understand. It was clearly out of character
WE LOVE YOU WILL YOU AINT DO NOTHING WRONG ANYWAYS KING!!!!!!!! IDIOTS MORE MAD ABOUT THIS THAN CRAZIER THINGS…DONT EVEN TRIP
Still love you Will! Always. ❤️❤️❤️
Leave jayda will
You are human. We all make mistakes.
Kinda like watching a Ricky Bobby interview before he learned what to do with his hands.
Just divorce that disgusting women and move on with your life dude.
I’m trying to sort this out. We all need to have the capacity to extend forgiveness. That said, this was a massive “mistake.” He had time to process before he casually strolled up and did what he did. Whether his remorse is genuine or not, I’ll never look at this dude in the same way. If that means my character is deficient, I guess I have work to do as well.
Wow. This is hard. I’m glad you admit your mistake, it takes a big man to do so in front of the whole world. We’re human and all make mistakes. It’s most important that we admit, learn from them, and try not to make them again. It’s clear that this was from the heart. It makes me sad that both you and Chris are experiencing trauma from this. I’m sorry and I hope you both will heal. We want to see you both move forward healthy and happy.
I have so much  more respect for him now for doing this. Not many celebs can admit their faults. He's done the right thing.  should have done it sooner but right thing
He should’ve just left it alone
We still love you ❤️
There is so much good in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us that it scarcely behooves any of us to talk about the rest of us. Look up to ONE, down on none and look straight across and you’ll see yourself
Took a long time coming. Why now.? Movie coming out??? 🤔
Will, You are loved! No, seriously... you are loved. You made a mistake or a bad decision, but the fact that you are addressing it and making amends for it speaks volumes. If I could give you a genuine heartfelt hug, I would. There's a tremendous amount of pressure being in the industry that you are in, and you're only human. A remarkable human being, as a matter of fact. You. Are. Loved. Will Smith, you are loved! I freaking love you... as a human being, as a great father. You will get through this. You've got this!
"Liked" the video before watching cuz I knew you would do the right thing. We love you!! 💖💖
So insincere and calculated. A public apology in service to WS’s brand and reputation. He even wears a cap bearing the logo of a company he owns, free publicity!
Dude this happened like a decade ago. We moved on. Yall should've too by now
Mistakes could be forgivable, but damage is sometimes irreparable. Can't look at you the same anymore. However, still sending healing energy your way.
No matter the circumstances that follow, I have always appreciated you as a human being. That being said humans make mistakes, it’s part of life. I find it extremely respectable that you have come out and said more on the situation.
I want to believe him but is this an actor acting for the internet or a humbled man being vulnerable and authentic? Hard to tell with how long he’s been acting.
Stop worrying about the opinions of people you don’t know! Mistakes are made and you are good man no matter what people say. You know it. I know it.
Love u Will!! U will get thru this!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Your whole family is crazy!
WE LOVE YOU CHAMP.
No one in this world is perfect! We love you 😩😩🙏🏻🙏🏻💛💕❤❤
I still have so much admiration for you, Will. That didn’t end in that moment. I’m so glad to see and hear you take accountability and show your remorse. It’s been beautiful to see you being human and expressing your vulnerability. Much love and peace to you!
So glad you put out this video, Will, and to see that you’ve managed to stay true to yourself during these troubling times. Love to you and your loved ones ❤️
We love you
Thats all it takes. A genuine apology. Its none of own business though. Its between Will and Chris first and foremost. The fact that he decided to do this publicly, thats more than enough. We do mistakes. We learn from them. We move on.  Now, people should mind their own business and leave this issue alone.  Love you, Will. Respect restored.
I forgive you, Will ✌️
we love you man
I respect will for this but you also gotta look at the other side of things from Chris. Dudes prolly traumatized.
I forgive you brother
Pride is the root of all sin. We all fall short to it one way or another. "What are the 3 greatest virtues? Humility, humility and humility". 👍
Will you are class - so happy you are reaching out. Now time to move on…
👏👏👏👏👏
And that reminds me of a phrase from a book I once read: "It's never too late to forgive, but sometimes it's too late to apologize."
Kings are ordinary humans we love and respect, all of us has done something that we wish we could take back anyone who says otherwise is kidding their selves. Still love and support you.
You are canceled and this video is way to late. Bye Felicia!
He had a whole PR team working on this so called apology of his..... You don't deserve to be forgiven 👎🏼
Too little too late .
The Bible says “Let He who is without sin cast the first stone.” And there isn’t one perfect person in the world except God. We all make mistakes. DAILY. I’m sure you have made way less mistakes than I have in my life. The only difference is yours was made in front of the world and replayed and relived over and over again. I cant imagine if my mistakes were broadcast to the world and then replayed. You have always been an inspiration to me, and the way you’re handling this is also inspiring. I always say never be afraid to mess up. Because if you never mess up, you’ll never learn how to recover. And learning how to recover is what makes legends. I’m praying for you and for you and Chris’ relationship to heal. God bless you Will. Not sure if it makes a difference, but all is forgiven on my end. ❤️
We ♥️ LOVE and appreciate your hard work, talent and  example. Life long fan.  We forgive you! One Love
Thank-you❤️ #LOVE(rb) #unity #humanity
We are human, we all make a mistake. We all use to show weird behavior. I thought Will was very overwhelmed by family and/or other situations. Chris please understand him, this is not the Will that we knew. Something happened before that night, he was sad. Please forgive buddy.
Damn will looks like there’s someone behind the camera with a gun pointed at him. I really hope this is genuine and comes from deep down
Biggest Man! We love you Will!
That's my bull. I will always stand behind you man. You made your mistake and own up to your accountability, responsibility an actions. I don't care what know one says about you, Iq will always have respect for you for who you are as a person man you know and you will always be my favorite. You always is and always was a stand up guy man. Keep growing and keep pushing for greatness man and stay bless 💯💯💯🐐.
Thank you!! You and Chris are Kings and will work this out...
“Players f*ck up too.”  -Kat Williams
An actor acting 🤷🏻‍♀️
He's just sorry about the backlash.
What a beautiful message, a real vessel of love. That's how we do it!
Will just calm down, you don't need the internet's opinion.
Just loved it. Yes, you are a human being. What is beautiful is this sincere act of humbleness. It can be seen in your eyes that is your heart speaking. Not an actor, just a man recognizing his vulnerability, his shadowss in a world wich everyone pretends to be perfect. Of course this world welcomes your warmth, your humbleness, your joy, your humanity.
Pedir disculpas le honra como ser humano! Dice mucho de su persona! ❤️
I love Will, what he did was wrong, but most of his careened been perfect but we’re all human and I’m glad he’s not pretending that he did nothing wrong.
Too little too late.  He's not sorry, this is just damage control.   Him and his family were bragging and partying afterwards.   Now that the phone has stopped ringing he needs to be the best actor he can be and pretend to be sorry.
Clown🤡
Self serving apology. Thats the most ignorant sequence I've seen on live TV
So Janet hubert was right after all……🤷🏽‍♀️ or not 🤷🏽‍♀️
I haven’t even finished watching the video and I am already shocked at the very little amount of time you spent addressing Chris….. basically, this did nothing for you. I think you just made yourself look worse.
This,is why people love you.. well me. Just taking responsibility is so powerful.
Welcome back! I love and support you.
Thanks for doing this, Will.  God bless you!
To anyone saying that he doesn't deserve forgiveness simply because he's a "star", have you never made a mistake in your life? Have you never done something you deeply regret and do want to try to fix if at all possible?   He did lose jobs, like he should have - every action has a consequence and he saw the consequences of his actions. That doesn't mean he deserves to suffer for the rest of his life.    If he is genuinely apologetic, and actually regrets doing what he did and learned from it, he deserves some grace - as each of us do.    If he isn't actually sorry and it's all just PR then Karma will find him. You get what you put out in the world.   For now I choose to believe that he means it that he knows he fucked up and is actively trying to better himself. If he isn't...well that's on him and time will tell.
This is so bizarre. How about saying that being compared to Demi Moore is actually a good thing!? Hollyweird never ceases to amaze me.
Respect. You’ve been my role model and it takes a lot to talk to the world again.
Damage control
It’s all love Will cause there’s a way frl!!!
Well said very well said. everyone makes mistakes Will I wish chis would have talked to you when you were trying to reach out to talk to him hopefully this video grabs his attention and accepts your apology. Good luck
Smh
People will apologize for anything because they're sorry about the repercussions, not the thing they did.
I was deeply disappointed in his actions. And everything about this video helps in getting over it. I hope him and Chris and Tony can find a way to be cool again. I do hope he's facing whatever made him act like this in the first place. Good luck to you, brother. I appreciate that you've put down the shovel, rather than dig the hole deeper like some 'yes' people in Hollywood were trying to have you do.
everyone makes mistakes we still love you will
This has taken its toll on him
We still love you! Being human is hard, we’ve all made mistakes, it’s how you handle things afterwards that matters. You have always had class! You coming on & apologizing is all you can do. Reminding all of us to love and grow through our own mistakes.
This right here is the reason we love you. Your vulnerability & your humanity; especially after reading your book, my heart genuinely goes out to you.   It’s okay to make mistakes. You are absolutely right, try to remove shame from the equation. You are on the right path Will, we love you and you still are an inspiration to many ❤️.
Only one person on earth's history lived a perfect life. Allegedly.
I still can’t watch the Williams sisters movie.
Apology accepted, we love you. Your book is my bedtime story. I love your book and we have missed you Will Smith!! We love Chris too!! At the end of the day You're Mom Mom's son and gigi's baby lover boy. I pray everyone can hug it out.
The cliche sit down intro lol
You lost me as a fan, sorry it’s just hard to not forget. It was more than just that situation, you were out partying afterwards as if nothing happened.  If you’re truly sorry find some way to make it right with Chris. Great apology speech though
You've been missed brotha. Hopefully we can get over this already.
Real Man! Love you man and hope you and Chris can have that conversation
❤
This seems totally heartfelt and sincere to me. To err is human, to forgive divine. When I think of the weight that every Black person carries in America every day of their lives... if we can learn from our mistakes and end up wiser people - that's all we can aspire to.
Pfffff tres meses para esto? Por alguien que ni lo merecía? Jajaja
Wish to see you comeback stronger than ever. You ar still the man will
That night and that incident isn't the sum of Will Smith. Period! I find it disheartening how people will throw out all the good someone has done and focus on this one misstep. Did anyone in the media ask if Will was okay because it was so unlike him? Did anyone besides me?  Then there were these "fellow" actors who said they wouldn't work with him because they were unsure of his anger or what have you. Get out of here! The only real "beef" Will had was with the original Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert) and they squashed that late last year. Or was it this year? 🤔  Will, keep it moving forward and upward in all you do. Like you said, "I am human." Each soul with an opinion must remember that for themselves as they walk through life. ✌🏽❤💯 #WillSmith #Courage #SelfReflection #WillSmithSpeaks
How do we know these questions are from fans and not just a set up to clear the air for damage control…
Glad to hear back from you gotta love the realness
It took you this long to apologize?!?!?!?!?!  All these years of hard work to become a failure...
So sorry for you Will, you are a good person, but human and everybody makes mistakes. 🙌🏽
You've always been a good person & good role model! You are also human & have done more than enough for everyone to move forward. Ppl will try to drag this out until kingdom come. Prayers & 💞 Will!
I've been following your work since The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. There hasn't been a minute that I doubted that you acted out of sheer emotion in that moment. We are all human and we all have acted out of anger, sorrow or sadness in some moments of our lives. All is forgiven as we are all human and it should be in our nature to forgive.
take a few more months
It's sort of hard to take an apology seriously when you've had 4 months to sit on it.  To me, it's nothing more than a reflection on your part, that YOU'VE be disowned by your fan base and now you're trying to save it.  If you had apologized that night, this would all be over now.  I'm in the entertainment business as well, and have learned that even one small outburst can have career long effects.  Maybe it's time you just rode off into the sunset and enjoy your life savings.  Live and learn Will.
Oh yeah, that new movie is coming out...
am I the only one that doesn't think he did something wrong? I was always taught you can do what you want but you CANT blaim someone for how they REACT.
🤡
You’re dead right all it took for you to ruin your career was one minute. In the one minute it took you to get on the stage and strike another person you ruined your whole career and then went partying afterwards. This apology should have been made the next day. It’s only being made now because you’ve become a pariah in Hollywood and you’re trying to save what’s left of your career. Too little far too late. And yes everyone makes mistakes.
Humans were born to make the mistakes.
All y'all saying that this took courage are naive! He's only doing this to try and save his failing career. Don't be mistaken that was his true nature the rest is just a showbiz  facade.
BYE Felicia!
He seems genuine but I understand if Chris needs more time to get over it.
Will I love you! I grew up watching you and so has my family! I see the hurt in your eyes and it’s ok. But I have a question… . . Where’s the wedding ring at though?? You honestly deserve better!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️love you!!
Will, you are still my dude. I read your book before this incident and when it happened, I understood what happened and what was going on in your mind at the time that it happened. You spoke about this very thing in your book. We all make mistakes and we all make erratic decisions at time. Yours so happened to be caught on tape. Don't let the hypocrisy of those who hold this against you win.
Keep your head up, king. Our mistakes don’t define who we are❤️
WHY FOLKS WANNA BLAME BW FOR EVERY F ING THING!!!?????
Only in Hollyweird. Fake is the new real! 🤪
You have enlighted our world for damn near 40 years. You are king, you are amazing. Chris is amazing, Tony is amazing. I m a fan of both of you and I can't imagine the pressure of being yall for a sec and I am responsible of only one kid. Godspeed, I hope you are at peace, even in your darkest moments you both inspire me, and you are EVERYTHING that I am expecting from you mr Smith. None of us should expect an apology from you, you dont owe us a damn thing. If anything, we owe you respect and gratitude.... except for WW west, I really wish you would have taken the matrix mr. Smith :). Will Smith = King.
Lul
Thanks Will.
Dude I promise you nobody cares anymore
This was not necessary will smith. I've admired you since I was little but you don't need so much apology!
Why judge anyone by their lowest moment when they acknowledge how wrong it is??
I've seen people go to jail for what you did will, that behavior was highly illegal. Shame on you
WE LOVE YOU WILL SMITH ❤️❤️❤️
Will I'm here, I've always been since always and specially since that day... Honestly I understood the reaction you had there but that's not the point here. I am here, I will always be, I admire you and I love you I'm so freaking happy to see again, love you❤️
May Allaah guide you to Islam Mr Will Smith
I still love you flaws and all❤️🥰
I will find the answer
How much did  slappy smith pay for this comment section? WTF!?
bye
you will always be my hero❤
you are human like the rest of us ❤️🙏
You are loved, supported, and appreciated Will❤️❤️
Shout out to Big Will for this. I wish for peace, brotherly love moving forward for both parties. We're not perfect.
You NEVER lost me, I love you and think that you are just AWESOME
I really hope Will’s apologies are accepted one day by the people he hurt. If not, I pray they and Will can still move along and live a free life without the burdens of that night.
I bought ur book …but I can’t read it anymore
I respect you a lot will. We all make mistakes.
Are you getting therapy?
Lol
We all humans , we all mess up…. In his case it just happened to be in front of millions of people. He’s still a great man regardless of what media says!
Thank you. My hero is back.
Great apology. Takes a real man to do this.
Man, this happens. Not all of us go through these moments where we don’t think about the consequences of our actions in the moment on camera in front of millions, but we do all have those moments of poor judgement. For you to apologize is all you can do. We’re with you, and we understand. You’re a commendable person, and we all should appreciate this video
If I did this in my workplace I'd be given a criminal record. But a rich dude does this and apologises from one of his 7 mansions and is called "inspirational". Ideally I hope he never lands another gig in his life. And suffers for his actions. Sure, forgiveness exists. But just because he is famous, it doesn't make it any more acceptable.
Wasn't cool what you did but we are human. We make mistakes. Fortunately for us it's not in front of the whole world
you're a very skilled actor
Hi there Mr Smith. Thankyou for your video. You  brought alot of awesomeness  to this world and I thankyou for this. May God bless and keep you and yours and I pray that amends will be made with all parties and that love and peace will follow.....
Everyone needs a low point in their life to learn about them and their background to be better of themselves. I am with you 💕
Will Smith your Fans forgive you .I want you to understand something the people that you work with that you've called your friends your peers; as you see ! are not your friends Wanda the comedian for instance is not your real friend and everyone who talked about you as if you cannot make a mistake please don't forget them they are phony Im begging you as a fan please do not ever forget them . They are not for you. You see how quick they turned on you .We your Fans love you we accept your apology now you must forgive yourself your brother Chris forgives you (that's why he's not talking about it) we love you. you have opened too many doors for too many people you are a legend.
Gettin Jiggy wit it🎊🎊🎊🤷🏽‍♀️🥰🥰🥰
You made a mistake just like we all do, you’re human. 🙏
Ive done dirty and dirt has been done to me. But everything all good apologyies given accepted and moved on to be a better person. I believe same applies to a high list celebrity such as will the courage to put this up for the world to see i cant imagine. Love you will since 90s always will.
I wouldve said to hell with everyone. But you a better man than me. Much respect to you brotha
Commendable. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thoroughly pissed off at you but this video is a great thing.  Everyone makes mistakes. You've been dealt the blowback and consequences for it. It's time to move on and I'm looking forward to your future work.
22k views 29k likes? Wtf
A finished man
You good with me Will, don't let the guilt you feel blind you from those that really want to see your downfall and couldn't care less about the whole situation.
ce que vous avez fait est inexcusable et vos paroles sont impardonnables. que quelqu'un de plus grand que toi te mette à la place de Chris. #growupchump
I appreciate the apology, Will and it seems sincere. Now it is time for us to accept it and it will take time as well. Life is too short to hold unto hate and give us time as well.
To be able to say "I am sorry" and admitting fault and work towards improving yourself is always commendable. I sincerely hope that when Chris is ready, that they'll be able to reconcile. Everything about this video was hopeful.
The fresh prince is back!
I am still a fan ,always will be ..we all make mistakes ,we are human beings , we love you ,the bible teaches mercy and forgiveness ..and will is gonna do everything in his power to make it right. May the the lord restore the power of love between these two brothers..
Nobody is perfect in this life we all make mistakes no matter who you are including chris.
How brave and decent of you will to wear one of your branded caps your company sells to get free publicity in a video you know will be seen all over the world. Very classy 😏
Buddy, I commend you for doing this, it's a big step. I want you to know you never let me down by that moment and I'll be waiting for your next project as I always have. Keep going man, you've done too much for us to let this be the end of your career. Love you man, I'll see you opening night at the cinemas for whatever you do next.🙂
I can understand the feeling... 💖
C'est bon il n'y à pas mort d'homme. On dirait qu'il a tuer quelqu'un
bro, drop jay-duh 😃
You're seen and heard.
I'm willing to give you a chance man, even though it's very hard.
<3
We except your apology I still love you and support you and your family ❤️ we all did thing without thinking first everybody just need to do a sit down
Love ya Will. Well done.
🤡🤡🤡
I swear will is such a nice dude this still doesn’t feel real.
Will is a legend
Well done, yo.
All these freakin quotes. Let's hear Chris Rock's quote on forgiveness.
I think Chris will eventually forgive you. I hope his family does as well. In my book you're still the man, the legend.
this is pathetic.
You are on an excellent way! We all make mistakes. We all disappoint people. There is only one person who has never failed and never let us down, and if you want to live putting light and love into the world, He is the only way. Don't try to do it alone. It's impossible for humans. Jesus Christ is the light itself. He is love. You know it. Just allow Him to heal you and shine through you. We flawed humans have no light of ourselves. But like the moon which puts light on the earth at night, we can reflect Christ, putting a bit of his light into the world.  "You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." (Mathew 5.14-16)
🔥🔥🔥
People & the mass/messy media made their poor choice to eclipse award celebrations by focusing on someone else's poor choice
Pressure bust pipes, is all I can say at this moment!!
I really don’t understand why there’s a five minute video explaining this. You were wrong, whatever reasons you had were stupid. Hopefully you won’t do something like that again. I’m not watching a five minute video explaining why someone did something childish.   Even your apology reeks of attention seeking.
I hope you know you embarrassed another another black man and made him look weak in front of the whole world and that’s just not cool…
GREAT ACTING JOB ON THAT MONOLOGUE!
✨🙏🏼✨
🤔🤐 🤚
Love you Will Smith!
Meh
Big move Will, much respect. I commend you for having the courage and dignity to come out and make a honest statement. I think your family and fanbase and Chris’s family and fanbase can move on and begin the mending process. Stay strong big boi!
This sounds scripted. The questions sound scripted. He's only trying to save and rewrite what's left of his legacy. Will Smith has awakened to the hell bent reality, you can spend a lifetime building character, respect, and integrity, but sadly it can all be torn down in one hour.
This why we love him
W PR STUNT LOL
bro, get rid of your girl, thank me later😉
Nah dawg, gtfo. You not a man. Work on yourself but you need a long time to do that.
Awe heck! Suck it up buttercup!
I hope you make the best of the situation Will.
Thank you for being open. You have the luxury of being able to explore your feelings and expound on that journey ... sometimes being WOKE comes with it's own set of values/credos and learning how we should or shouldn't react or respond becomes a problem unto itself. Self-reflection and privacy in your choice on how it will affect you in future confrontations is still a choice for you and your well-being. Love & Peace
Still love you Will Smith. Every one of us makes mistakes.
Thats why we are called human we make mistakes.You never let us down Will
Will I love this as men we have traumas and triggers I love how you not only addressed the hard stuff head on but have gone down a path of healing ❤️‍🩹🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Forgiven! We all do emotional things that are not right. Thank you for taking the time to get help for yourself - very important i above all of this.
I love you man a lot of strength in these difficult times
I don’t know man, for some reason I just don’t feel like he’s truly apologetic for a moral stand point. He’s speech seems robot, maybe he should of taken more time to come back.
Not getting new roles ? Lol, repentance after so long, publicity stunt.
At least he admits he was in the wrong.
Dammit Will smith! You’re a good dude.
So Chris can't even reach out. Says a lot and way more about him than anything. 🙄 At least with an apology himself.
Y’all know wtf been going on and why he had to do what he had to do. Everybody he apologized to, all the fans and the media or the reason for it. I blame everybody but Will
L person
Will... It took alot of guts to do this, not many man up and admit they're mistakes, hold their hands up and make a conscious decision to fix things. you'll always be a role model and inspiration to me..at least you aint gotta worry about that.   Hope you get it all sorted with chris and most of all, that your not beating yourself up.   I mean look man, we all make mistakes, but i couldnt imagine how i would feel if one of my biggest mistakes was out there going viral. I wouldnt be able to handle it as well as you have, so dont forget to forgive yourself. It IS ok to do that.
Here’s my well produced apology with three camera angels lightning and a teleprompter… What a piece of S$:@
I was hoping you'd finish with your signature "wooooh!" after all was said and done.
@Will Smith, you put too much pressure on yourself, I wish you peace ! Like you said,you're  human! We are all out here struggling with something!
Will we are all human and we all make mistakes. U can feel the hurt and sincereness in ur voice. I dont think u know how big of an impact u had on this generation. It take a man to apologize on what he did and i respect that. Im a 90s kid so growing up u were my hero and i will strongly say today u are still my hero. Cant wait to see what the future holds
We all have our moments of weakness. Moments in which we fail ourselves. You did something wrong, but you can climb back up and be the person that I believe you really are. You have an amazing platform on which to show the world that mistakes can be overcome.
Good work for saying sorry. You are very lucky that this will have a minimal impact on your life. Most people who go down this road wouldn’t be so lucky.
What about Chris' father?
I am with you and proud of you for speaking your truth no matter how hard that was to do. I can feel your tension and the hurt you are going through. This is a season in your life and you will come through this with more love and compassion for yourself and others. I believe in you and your ability to navigate this very real circumstance. You are brave and that is what people need to see right now. That you CAN overcome hard things in life with truth and vulnerability. Thank you for your rawness and for facing your fans in this step forward Will. As a recovering people pleaser myself. I feel you on this deeply!
This is about 4 months too late, my guy.
Ego is a powerful beast. We all have our moments of reckoning.
Miss you Will!! Love you!
Don't beat yourself up over this. You were pressured to do something you didn't want to do by a manipulative person. As long as you've learned from your mistakes and moved on, you're golden.
This is one of the few men that stood up to Suge Knight and lived.
He is only doing it to promote his new movie... What a CAULK...
My question is why he waited this long???
Mr. Smith,   We love you. You are only human, mistakes will be made in life, and you learn from them. I am so sorry some people want to make you keep paying for a mistake that you have owned up to and apologized for. I hope you and those who were hurt by your actions can overcome and be at peace. ❤️
Hey Will, long time fan here. I'm proud of you taking time to process all of this and to respond in this way. I know that everyone makes mistakes, and I know many who have failed and gotten back up and moved on. I'm sure you did and are learning something about yourself and you'll be better for it all in the end.
We are all human. Continue to surround yourself with positive and honest people and we fundamentally know you will teach many others a great lesson through this experience. You are moving mountains.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Disappointing people is my central trauma"  cant get more SHOWBIZ than that !
We've never stopped being your friends. Life is about stumbling and learning as we stand back up.  Elevate
I’m proud of your bravery to make this video. Never forget that you’re a human child of God, and call on the power of God and all your ancestors to help guide you in this life. Forgive yourself and do the work you’re obviously doing. You still have so much to give the world through your gifts and talents. Be blessed 🙏🏽
I appreciate you bro. I've been a fan since the 80s. it takes a real man to apologize.
I AM ONLY HUMAN AFTER ALL... DON'T PUT THE BLAME ON ME....
Wish you put this apology when it happened. That statement you put out before wasn’t as heartfelt as this was. People make mistakes, it’s the actions that come after that show people who you are. Praying that you find the peace and understanding you need.
We all make mistakes. you have to address the root cause.
Wtf are we just gonna forgive him for what he did that easy ???
He is still trying to make it all about himself. He is a narcissist. Finally showed his true colour for all to see  live on the world stage. He destroyed Janet Hubert career (1st Aunty Viv career on the fresh prince of bel Air series) though his narcissistic attitude towards her when she faced contractual issues on the show. He has got away with it for so long in the past. karma for you Will.
Thank you for speaking out on this. I know this is not you. I know this was a heat of the moment decision that reverberated on you and everyone you love and Chris and his family. Thank you for apologizing and showing that we’re all human. We all do things we regret and I feel the deep remorse and emotion your grappling with. I’ve been a fan since day one. I’m still a fan. Thank you for putting love out into the world. It will come back to you. God bless and welcome back.
How can you have 19K views and 25K likes😂
hermanito principe del rap, ya fue la wea.
People who hold grudges and can’t forgive others, especially after they apologize… those people have some personal work to do too. Yes I still think he should be charged in some way, but also forgiven. No one’s perfect.
Nuance or seance......
2 men got into a fight. I'm over it. It was a mistake on the part of BOTH men IMO. Some of my BEST friends are the ones I have scrummed with.  I think both sides can learn from it. Life isn't always sunshine and rainbows. This is how the world works. The. End.
You a real nigga Will‼️‼️😤
I will first say I have enjoyed Will Smith's movies in the past but after what he did I may not in the future. It was a character defining moment for me so a 5-minute clip is not going to erase a severe lack of judgment that occurred in front of millions of people.  That said, I appreciate his apology but it seemed rehearsed, produced even, down to the setting and the pre-selection of those questions.  I'm sure he feels bad but I think it's more about future movie ticket sales than it is a true mea culpa.  If he really felt that bad about what happened it wouldn't have taken FOUR MONTHS for a public apology.  Just my two cents.
Personally speaking I just wouldn’t let you do that to me
Will, love you, man. We think we know what causes us to do the things in our lives. Once in a while, we don't. I'm glad to see you reaching out. I believe there is a root cause to drive you there. I really hope you find it and destroy or separate yourself from that.
Will I love you man, we've all done stupid things in our lives that we later regret, DON'T BE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF, FORFIVE YOURSELF AND MOVE ON! No one is perfect except for Jesus Christ and I can guarantee you HE loves you. When it's time hopefully you and Chris can have a heart to heart and finally put this incident behind you. I just want the happy Will Smith back.
Growing up in the 90's watching fresh prince and then the whole string of movies Will acted in, Will quickly became my favorite actor. Have such a soft spot in my heart for the guy... Will I don't know if you read this this but I want you to hear that your not a POS. You were created in the image of God wich gives you incredibly high value. Like you said though, your human, which means born a sinner like every other man, so your going to mess things up. When I look at you I see a man seeking forgiveness and wanting to be a source of love and light in this world, let me tell you that those desires you have are good and are only found in Jesus. Forgiveness is found in Jesus, not only that but through faith in Him you become a "new creation  in Christ". The Bible calls Jesus "the light" and also says "God is love". Put your hope in Jesus to forgive you and allow His love and His light to work in you so that you can be an ambassador of that love and if that light here on earth.
Will bruh be strong and I stay with you. All fault Chris I'm sure
Bro💀cool nice
I'm proud of you for this video Will. We're all human and have all fallen short of the glory of God. Forgive yourself. Much love brother 🙏 💙
Clown
Keep strong
Seemed a bit robotic obvious hes had loads of therapy over the last few months. Could have been a little more "real" but meh good enough . Accepted
You did what you felt right in that moment. Millions understand you and love. You got the hearts of many that could do exactly what you have done. Compassion, respect and love. God bless you in so many ways, it is what really matters.
I Forgive You
Somebody tell Chris Will is read to apologize now. Chris, get your clown suit on and get out here ASAP. An A-lister wants to apologize. Hurry up! 😆
Let me just unsub real quick
All I see, I Love, for All is I 🙏❤️🌞
I've been waiting for an apology video! It's about damn time! YouTube is only for apology videos these days.
I'm still a fan of yours
This took a lot of courage to do. I wish you good luck!
You’re human Will. Everyone makes mistakes. What we need to do, is learn from it. To better ourselves, thats a part of us progressing through life. I don’t know you personaly, but from what I understand from media and people who knows you. You’re a very gentle and kikdhearted person.   The bad thing about being an official personality, is that something like this blows out of proportions way bigger than what it needs to..   Just be you!!! You’re awesome!!
Yaaasss, he's back... I love you Mr. Smith!!!
I still think you're a great person despite what happened. When we idolize people, we pur them in a place to disappoint us. Everyone makes mistakes and we all need forgiveness. The spotlight on you just magnified your mistake. Keep letting your light shine!! Walk in forgiveness. 🥰🥰
Клёвый чел, мне кажется он в тот момент просто потерял грань между ролью в кино и ролью в жизни, всё мы люди и все мы ошибаемся и лучшие из ошибающихся это кающиеся👍
Dang I forgot about this already
Eeerrrr!!!! It's rewind times
We all make mistakes. Considering I wasn't there and it didn't involve me, it truly just is what it is.
Beta whipped dog
Well  said... Trust the process... Now the work begins Stay in courage
I don't care!!!
😊
Finally, this is what needed to happen. However, there is a lot not said that needs to be said, but is a beginning to healing and win the trust of others. Next step is to sit down with Chris and I apologize to him face-to-face for the world to see. Then the world will forgive you and move on.
Forgiveness is the right thing for everyone.
I know it's not related to this video but ... Wtf 21k views and 27k likes. You know what I'm gonna watch this tomorrow coz this is weird af
We all make mistakes, only one perfect man has ever lived. Fan since Fresh Prince, still a fan.
Yee
Nope
Much love Will, Don't worry we all know your surrounded by demons. You had to play a role and now it's time to come clean, MOVE ON!!!
If I was Chris, we would never talk.
As a fan, apology accepted! Still going to take time to get past it. One public error after a lifetime of being a role model as an easy going, non-confrontational, fun-loving, family-oriented BLACK MAN has been devastating to Black America and America on a whole. But know we still Love you Will. We feel bad for you, your family, and us. Being on public display for the world to judge is taxing. Your effort throughout your career has not gone unnoticed and prayerfully we will heal together from this experience. Hold your head up, stay humble, stay blessed!
Love you Will.. your human and everyone makes mistakes. You still have my support and I understand how you got to that point in your life.
donate all the money generated from this video to the national bullying prevention center
We forgive you WILL we are all HUMAN!!!!! We all make mistakes and it take a real good man genuine man to apologize thank you this has made my day so much better.🫶🏼
He started it with a sigh
All tupacs girls fault
We love you Will! You’ve taken accountability which most in your shoes wouldn’t have done. You have a HUGE support system. Keep going strong. You’ve got this.
Wow.... so instead of respecting Chris and him not ready to talk or hear your apology yet and you take that from him and just do it anyway.   Then to bring up "I have cEnTrAl tRaUmA with letting ppl down".... well apparently that wasn't a concern that night.   This video literally did nothing
A wise man extends an apology. A wise man excepts an apology....but no amount of wisdom wipes away the action.
morbius
Whoever said, “It’s better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission", needs to watch this...
That PR team sure did a good job Will! I hope Chris's health is steadily being repaired as we go on.
You just learning to read a teleprompter bruh?
You are Will Smith. There is nothing you can do about it.
You weak Will Smith!
I still love Will Smith. He’s still one of the most exceptional human beings walking this earth. We adore you.
One attitude doesnt define who you are. First of all you are human and you, as you all, make mistakes but you being in the eyes of the world, this has a different projection. You are a human being
Please read on as this is not a slight in anyway should you choose to read this. I'm not sure what advice you have been given or what steps you have taken in your self-reflection. I can say that the remorse I see in this video is real. My heart breaks for you and this is why however. You have been in the spotlight FOR A LONG TIME trying to display an image you have created and that has also been created for you. Hollywood's "nice guy." I truly believe that you are in fact a nice guy but what you also are and all of us are also something else, you are human as you mentioned in the video. This humanity is not a small thing. Being human makes us capable of great accomplishments as well as terrible tragedies and poor choices. I hope you take the time to embrace your humanity. Stop trying to be something to everyone else. Instead, do your best to be the best you and should that be inspirational, then so be it, if not, fine but at least the pressure to be for others is gone. be you, for you and be authentic and genuine and real and these moments that you experience will have either more hope or more peace but less stress or pressure. In some small way, I hope you know you have not let me down in any way but then again, I stopped putting my hope in others as I put hope in myself which frees me from the disappointment in others. I am free to enjoy your work and have hope for you in these moments. I learned this when I became a counselor and it has helped me tremendously, I hope it helps you or anyone else in need of this should you or they read it.
Everyone makes mistakes Will…..even you. There’s no point in beating a dead horse, man up and get over it.
I love you Will, now can I get back to my show.  Bel-Air ❤️
Same old BS!
People make mistakes. Forgiveness is a part of healing. We love you Will🙏
No one is perfect. You’re accountability is inspiring. We’ve all made mistakes.. learning from this and not repeating them is what matters. Take care - sending you love!!
Lmao
Always looked up to will growing up, he was my favourite actor ever since I bought the big willie style cd, my first cd I ever bought. That moment really let me down, I’m still trying to find a way to deal with all this, somehow this video still doesn’t do it… it’ll take some more time, I totally get why Chris isn’t ready to talk. Maybe after he does I can see where I am at
Ma'dude respect for owning up to your mistake. God damn! that's a first seeing Youtuber actually apologize, then beating around the bush to throw the blame on someone else.
Will was wrong and acted on impulse but he owned it 100% and is doing what he can to rectify it. I don't think there's a need to keep bringing out the pitchforks but he's never going to live this one down.
Go away...career over
Should be charged. If anyone of us assaults someone like that, we would be in jail.
I respect you immensely and have always been a fan of your work. Spoken like a true King.
This video has more likes than views 🤔 I applaud his bravery in addressing this while he's still working through it 👍🏾 It had to happen eventually but I still see that pressure to appease/everyone and neglect his own feelings.
If you see a problem fix it! Don’t let bad things cloud your judgment, or it will happen again.✌️
As far apologies goes this one really felt sincere. As a person who is trying to improve himself at the moment, I really resonated with the quote "I am trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself". I think that's a good and important starting off-point then people might realize.
Thank you Will.💙 I will always love the humanity in you you.
Good on Will for his growth. You can't please everyone on the internet. You're still gonna have skeptics and those people, in particular, probably don't even know the nuances that surround the situation but simply just open their mouth for the shock value that comes with having a disrespectful or raw take. As long as you genuinely made the attempt to rectify the error and make peace with yourself and whomever you've wronged, you can move forward. Still a fan of Will Smith.
You are quite a man, WIll.
This is why I respect Will.
This is very genuine I hope Chris has forgiveness for you so everyone can see two men reconcile before our eyes and that would be more impactful than the incident
You are a great example of manning up.😊❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🕊🎯
19k views.  27k likes.  the bots aren't letting enough of the video play to register as a view 🤣🤣
The apology should have been a private moment between those involved, and it should have happened months ago, doing it on social media smacks of being desperate for the public to all think "aww well at least he apologized, what a lovely man"  Nah sorry it don't wash with me. If a member of public did what he did they'd have been locked up period.
Glad you’re back we love and support you
This is all an act. Dude is not right in the head. And people are eating it up...
Ive looked up to you for as long as i can remember Will. That mistake changes nothing, i know youre human just like the rest of us. We love you Will, keep moving forward, thats how winning is done.
28k thumbs up, and only 21k views? More likes than views? Is YouTube manipulating numbers?
All this money this guy has and still acts better then everyone.. great acting skills
Here comes the apology tour.
Aww I feel your pain in this video. We are human people need to realize we are all flawed. Take some time and reflect you will be ok. Sending love from Philly. We still love you!!!
💚
If they don’t accept you apology 🤬 em! 🤷🏽‍♂️💯
I know this took more than 10 takes 😂
Oh please! Just disappear for a couple of years. Enough of you!
why do you have to give Chris public apologies, just reach out to him privately. It seems like you’re just trying to repair your career.
The fact that it took you this long to listen to your publicist and do the right thing speaks volumes on your narcissistic attitude. We aren't watching this because you're sorry to Chris. You're sorry you're career is going through this currently.
He's lying he doesn't feel remorse
Really according to his book disappointment is the central trauma of will's life.He will always be my hero.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🥰🥰🥰
we all have those moments it's just that some like to forget and act like they don't happen, you're a good man that's all that matters
What does the logo on his hat mean?
All love…forever ♥️♥️
He has messed up just like he has messed up his son. Terrible job.
Will we behind you regardless! 💯🐐🗣
Summarise
A word of advice, Will, if you ever read this: Think of how you handle your private life and how much of it you share with the public.
Ive had enough of YouTube apology videos
Love you Will!
Proud of you Mr. Will for humbling yourself and sincerely apologizing.   Now Let Go and Let GOD! HE is the BEST at mending broken hearts, binding up wounds and restoring relationships.  Surrender your hurt, shame and disappointments to The True and Living GOD and watch HIM work all this out. I will begin praying for healing for you, chris and his family. Much Love!
Owning up to one's mistakes and faults is commendable. This, you can tell was sincere, heartfelt and simmered for some time within him. When Chris is ready to engage. I hope they can sit down as men, Will can do this apology in person. Then they can move forward in whatever way that makes sense for THEM.
I feel it was sincere and came from the heart and he did in fact finally man up but...he said "I'm sorry" to everone but Chris. "I appologize" isn't the same as "I'm sorry." IMNSHO 7/10 Will.
Fortnite and Marques Brownlee
Nobody's perfect. Respect to you brother. You are a LEGEND.
I love you baby!! ❤️
Count the # of times he said will
It's takes a lot more than these sincere but hollow statements to repair the damage done.
❤️
Love you Will and thanks for your contributions all these years. You've done a great job💖
will smith
This was Soooo UnNecessary...  Bruh you are winning.  If you NEVER do another movie again...  Take your spoils and sail off into the sunset.  That $h!+ happened and it's over.  We forgot foreals until you brought it back up.  You're so far into the stratosphere you lost connection with us Earthlings.  Bruh move on.  You won!
its all bs and acting for profit
Why's he look like tiger woods?
I forgive you will. ❤️🙏🏾 hope Chris does too one day
You're an actor. I didn't believe a word you said.
When he said “I’m here when ever your ready to talk” he should’ve been made himself Available to him…
Even in your mistakes you are one of the most inspirational People.
Man don't let your head dive to deep into this. Shrinks be getting people to dissect every thing we do and they always want to trace everything back to some trauma in our past. Bump that stuff! Sometimes you gotta let dude know that I AINT THE ONE!
He just looks and sounds defeated
Respect
I love you Will you are a superstar
This didn't need to be made public. You owe the public nothing. What you do owe is a personal apology to Chris. No text message. No IG DM. No Email. No youtube. Him personally as a man. If he doesn't ever want that apology or talk to you. That's his business. Move on cause what you did is damn near unforgivable. Kick Rocks Will.
Everything will be ok brother. You are and always will be a stand up man. Always had respect for you, nothing has changed. We are all creations doing are best to live and do the right things. Even a seed goes through it’s breaking point. After all the s***(soil 🤷🏾) it goes through. That same seed begins to embark on a journey that is new. Filled with life and awesome fruit. Freedom is always in holding ourselves accountable through our apologies. Your are free, and I pray Chris and others can forgive you. May God continue to bless you and your family. #BadBoys4life Best Wishes 🙏
You're not a robot, you're not a super hero!!!!! You're human, if anyone is perfect and doesn't set a foot wrong, well good for you super human. If you're human you will understand
You see you made a mistake and you apologized. We are all human. I tale my hat off to you will. It takes a real man to do what you just did. God bless it'll be ok Will we forgive you.
Love you Will 💜💜💜💜💜
Ayo keep my wife’s name out your mouth
And this was not genuine, it's just something your attorneys told you to say and address, scripted.
It wasnt just that.. It was the way you went up to him while still laughin so he wouldnt see it coming!!! And then your son goes on Twitter and he’s proud of what you did!! Youre raisin him to do the same.
In an age where nobody says sorry anymore, nobody says 'I was wrong', 'I made a mistake' and simply "doubles down". This was refreshing and redemptive.
Matthew 18: 21-22  Jesus forgave others, we should too, I hope Chris talks to Will and accepts his apology.  Forgive 70-7 times.
Unfortunately, you've lost a lot of respect from a lot of people that your apology will not fix.
Glad u apologize will...u still one of my favorite actors
Love you Will Philly loves you too. People make mistakes you are forgiven
This was nice and necessary - but I think the WISE choice is to step away from public life. You've had a good run, but the last few years have been "different" to put it kindly. Retire and do good - there is a space to be a positive person who is also a private person. Consider that ❤
I love you will ♥️♥️♥️♥️
All my love to you Will
Way too late. Sounds dishonest and more like a damage control move. Divorce her because she's clearly the reason you acted that way.
shata....
God bless you will smith
Most genuine apology video out there.   well said Will.
you're trying to do this without 'being ashamed' of yourself? you SHOULD BE & NEED TO BE ASHAMED of yourself. what you did was SHAMEFUL. however, it is good to see you finally addressing the situation. i  truly hope everyone that was hurt by your actions, including you, can find some kind of peaceful resolution with it all. ✌❤
Beyond the noise of this moment, we must respect his willingness to be open and vulnerable—owning up to his actions. It's an extreme at both ends: a clear example of how *not* to act with the world's eyes upon him, and then a clear example (thru most of the rest of his public life) as to how to live and embody goodness and truthfulness in your own skin.
It was MORE than a moment, you thought about it, made a choice, you got up from your chair in front of everyone, started to take a step, went up stairs, walked all the way to him, reached all the way back, then decided to follow through while looking at him, his face, the whole time up to him. Focus on yourself and move on. You hurt millions of Americans and children watching that night.
Will will Smith Smith? Will Smith will Smith.
I was waiting for this. People make mistakes, especially when they react, in the moment, to strong emotions. I've always said if you're man enough to apologize, I'm man enough to accept your apology. To Chris, take your time in processing the apology. I'm sure the right answer will come to light. Both will be at peace and one day both will be able to laugh about it. 🙏🏻🙏🏻👊🏼
We love you man really missed you ❤️
People make mistakes and you gotta forgive yourself. This video is a great moment and I hope it teaches others that even at your most vulnerable moments you can be honest and humble and begin forgiving.
*moistcr1tical if u see this ur the man, HE AINT SEEING DIS*
We love you Will
I'll be 100 with you i doubt you'll see this but i would have probably done the same thing. Was it the best choice no and i feel bad for you that you have to worry about public opinion.
I know he did smthing wrong but i feel bad for will. Hope we can put this in the past
I'll give you credit for the production of this content but not your sincerity
You good Will a lot of people still got mad love for you including me, don’t stress over this man.
To err is human, to forgive is divine.
Didn't he literally won an award for best male actor, why is he reading emotionlessly from a teleprompter? Dude hire me, I can write you an apology script that will make Chris apologize to you!
You are one hell of a man and a hero to many. You made one mistake. From reading your book I understand it was driven from a childhood trauma. You got triggered and I’m so sorry it had to be at that time and so public. But please remember regardless of backlash you are loved, you are an incredible inspirational person and the making of this short video proves that. Love and peace to you and your family x
This happened in March and it’s the end of July.  This is pathetic 🤦🏼‍♀️
This video has more likes than views.  How does that work?
Wow
Nah bro. It took you three months to think about this?! GTFO
Okay but you should've manned up sooner BUT it's better later than never ✌️we all have over awshit moments 👍
Worth it for the memes
As a fan I’m glad you have publicly apologized to Chris. I was absolutely done with anything Will smith,this was my only wish(public apology).you are doing what you have always urged of us(esp black men),never too big too apologize and walk with love.All is well Big Will,as for Chris,he’ll come around.when he is ready to.God bless
Oh Will, I wish we could meet and just have a chat, No selfies, signatures or fancy locations. Just 2 humans talking.
Will I have so much respect for you. This video shows strength, humility, remorse and pure honest in the rawest human form. We are not perfect ppl, but flawed individuals ALL hoping to become the best version of ourselves. Everything you said was humbling and well received. We all make mistakes, what you did is NOT a life sentence. The internal work is what matters the most. Thanks for your vulnerability and transparency. I’m ready to see your next movie! 🎬
Too late Liberals don't forgive are forget.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
❤ 🙏🏾 Glad you put in the work. We all mess up, but God still loves us anyway. So proud of you for apologizing to Chris and I pray that you both can talk, heal, and move forward.
I ain't mad anymore because we love Will. 😍
Never lost respect for u never will actors have done worse and got less hate
I look back on many of my stupidities and am extremely ashamed. One either learns and is hurting in a way unimaginable too those whom knows them. “Will”, I believe will possibly be a far better individual farther down the road because of this moment of devilish stupidity. We either change too trust God in Christ or keep on being dependent on ourselves and used by demons. Praying for both brothers who can help others heal.
I would of moved the position of that lamp!
It's way too late you're trying to get pity..👎
Can we talk about the political and economical state of the world right now ?
You owe us nothing king
Will, you are a great man. I love your work - we never met but you seem like an awesome person to be around. You apologized and took the high road. I'm so proud of you for owning everything and being so transparent. WE ALL can't wait to see you make us laugh and cheer again. Be blessed bro!
One of the shadiest things I’ve ever seen. Especially seeing as how you & your soon to be ex are divorcing. On the other side of the coin I’m not you & don’t know what you were going through personally at the time so I have a hard time pointing finger at you. Don’t judge others until you walk in their shoes. So easy for all of us to shame you & ridicule you from afar but we aren’t you so we shouldn’t in all honesty. Also I commend you & praise you for reflecting on yourself, admitting/addressing your mistake, & apologizing. Much respect Will Smith. You got my support again.
Thanx for your honesty and addressing all these questions… Hopefully soon all will be mended. Prayers for you all .
“Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.”  ~Bruce Lee
Although I don't agree 100% with your actions, I can understand the feeling of being clouded by emotion. I will always be a fan, and I love your work Will. Stay cool and funky!
WILL SMITH is THE GOAT!!!
You are an amazing human being. We all have done things we’re not proud of. But taking responsibility for that mistake and asking for forgiveness as well as forgiving yourself is the best thing we can do. Praying everyone can move forward and accept forgiveness.
This takes a lot of guts my man. Makes me respect you more again. Wow.
Well Will, everyone messes up from time to time, we're only human after all, and being a celebrity you have a huge spotlight on most everything you do. Not going to like or dislike this, just want to commend you for a heartfelt apology to Chris and everyone. Actions speak louder than words, so bear that in mind and we'll sit back, see what happens next, and wish you well.
***Slow claps***Hoping to be friends again…. Chris doesn’t need that kind of friendship. All people here who are ready to give him a second chance are not thinking about Chris Rock’s feelings. Will is doing this apology just to get back all the money he’s currently losing. It’s true we’re all make mistakes, but this was so wrong in so many levels. Ask all yourselves if your friend did this to you, would you be able to forgive? Friends don’t mistreat friends. Period. Nice try Will… I’m so done with him!
I have a lot of respect for your video, but it truly doesn’t matter what everyone thinks of you or your actions. What matters is what you think of yourself Will. You don’t know me, but I feel I’ve known you MY whole life and looked at you as a role model. THAT MOMENT IN TIME DOES NOT DEFINE WHO YOU ARE! Only you have control over that, just as I have control over my personal reactions. Will Smith was a name synonymous with integrity, class, humor, and respect. Remember that you never had to cuss to sell records, but your work as a whole, broke many records! Be at peace will, much love!
Don’t care. Never gonna trust his face.
Look what i done for you
Why appologize for the best meme ever
we fall down, we get back up.
Much love to Will. It's take growth own up to one's actions. We all have moments. Unfortunately, theirs was televised for the world to see and lay judgement upon. Will continues to be someone to be inspired by in my eyes...
We still love you.
For someone who has loved everything you have done in life and truly put you on that pedestal it was hard and disappointing to see this moment play out, you are better than this.  No one is perfect and we all make mistakes, it's how we act and what we do after mistakes that truly shows what we are made of. Keep you head up and continue to work on yourself. Forever a fan.
Will good to see you back!
Yes a bad choice definitely shouldn't happened like that but we all have emotions from things that end up coming out unfortunately wills came out in front of millions of people. We are all humans. In my opinion it didn't make him a bad person. Always have and always will be a fan. Much love
CLOWN
I hope Chris is alright and will sounds sincere in his apology 💜 I hope everyone recovers from this situation
Honestly, Will isn't the problem it's the people that act as if they have never done anything wrong in their life. They will sit behind their phones and judge someone to the core and it's not right. He made a mistake, he's owned that mistake, and because of it he can become a better man. Life is not about the stupid things you do but it's about how you overcome the stupid things you do.
Well said We are all human  We are not perfect  Keep you head up  WILL!!!
I thought u had dreadlocks😅
Welcome back, Will! You are a man with a big heart and an inspiration to many who love and admire you, your work and family. We love you!!!
Will smith, you're forever a inspiration my brother. We all react and do things out of character. That's just the nature of being human. Look forward to  Emancipation
You fucked up. You reflected. You apologized. Respect.
Regarding people being disappointed, it was a moment of a lapse of judgment.  There’s no reason to be disappointed for the rest of our lives.  In any situation, I believe having empathy and understanding for all, and forgiving so that we can all move on. Don’t feel like a piece of crap for that short moment Will. You apologized.  Now focus on all the great moments. TFS
This will do nothing to change any opinions. I think the backlash has been grotesquely over the top. But that won't change.
Love this. I felt the heart and sincerity from your words. God bless you and all your future endeavors
Maybe you should apologize to all the fans that have gotten you to this point in your life. Without the fans there would be no Will Smith. Apologize to the black community which you care nothing for, apologize about how this would never have happened if it was a white comedian. I know we all make mistakes but you showed your true colors that night, so good luck with your multi million dollar bank and continue to have no remorse for the people this incident actually affects
You're just saving face so you can start your next movie campaign. Not buying it.
Big or small, Mistakes happen. None of us on this earth are perfect. We can gain wonderful attributes and achievements in life, but it will never make us perfect. I personally,  thank you for your humility and courage in coming forward to apologize and be accountable as a man to your fans and the world, for unfortunately publicly losing your composure. Still friends. 🤗
I cried and cried when this happened ..For the simple fact I FORGET I DONT KNOW YOU IN REAL LIFE
He got in one little fight and his team got scared and said, "You're apologizing on YouTube with a three camera set up."
I respect you for manning up and taking responsibility for your actions...  I pray for Chris' hurt and shame as well as for you.. I look at the both of you as being. mild mannered...easy going.. I know the stresses of life can alter our character and behavior (Will),   I hope in Chris' time he can accept the apology.  I ❤ you both...
❤
Nice of you to make this Video Love u bro
Go show Questlove some love next
Will Smith, I come without judgment. We all have experienced flashes of anger in our lives. You said, no part Of you thinks how you reacted was appropriate.   Are you sure?    I’m asking this because after the incident your children chimed in with comments like, that’s how we do it and so on.   Your children are a reflection of you to some extent, I do know they are adults and make their own choices however, there is a lot of baggage here and maybe you should have waited to apologize to Chris before attempting to publicly salvage your reputation before coming to an understanding together with Chris privately.   Now you make him look like he’s holding a grudge. Will the insults ever end? Perhaps you should have thought of it that way.  Look at your comments Will, everyone is now watching the ball you threw in Chris’s court. That’s a lot of pressure for someone who literally didn’t ask for any of this.
sending love, i wrote a poem this week inspired by this situation... you're the best
nice acting will.
I love you Will.
Meh
Will Smith is a good person who made a terrible mistake. I think he learned a lot as have we all from this experience. It's also heartwarming to see all the positive comments here, that's a rarity indeed.
No podemos preveer el futuro, pero si se puede perdonar, ahora demuestra al mundo todo lo que vales, ponte en tu mejor forma fisica y vuelve a ser el will de siempre y quedara en un error de la vida, siempre will. I love...
Everyone makes mistakes. I feel Chris is milking this for all it’s worth.
Life goes on, you can’t beat yourself up about this forever..Good on you for this video and you owe it to yourself to be happy and move on
We forgive you will ❤️
Chris should come out too, that’s unfair
Bit late to apoligize , i cant stand him
You had a moment of weakness but by all means your still 'Will Smith'.. Great to see you again
Props to you, Will. The apology felt genuine and heart felt.
We LOVE you Will.
You were viewing the world from the lens of your past. The broken out there understand Will drive on man.
NO APOLOGY NEEDED. I've watched you over the years and I've known you to be a kind, upstanding person. I've also watched Chris over the years take pot shots at your family, thinking it was "funny". Well it wasn't. And he decided to take that last pot shot on national television (excuse me, international tv) also thinking that was funny. It wasn't. And of course he had no problem doing this to Black Woman with a medical condition. NO APOLOGY NEEDED. STAY STRONG WILL AND GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
He had me until he smiled and apologized to her. WTF Will?? 🤷🏾‍♂🤷🏾‍♂
Was this scripted answers tho😑?
Now this is the man we know and love!!!
Letsss Goo WIll! Keep Pushing through. This was well explained, and I applaud the humility and vulnerability you showed here.
I think he should get a second chance. Over the last 3 decades he has been a good role model to many, for a moment he looked tormented and mentally struggling pushing him to do the unthinkable.         I think he is a good person and will pay deeply for his actions over time therefore, the public don't need to punish him any further.
Make a movie together and everything will be ok
I'm proud of you for being in the human business just as much as the entertainment business. Celebrities are people not GODS and should not be held to a higher standard because of status! Keep doing and being you! Hope that things can be resolved between you all 💪🏾💖!
thank you
Queue the body language experts in 4...3...2...🙄
I certainly didn't feel that I needed an apology from Will, but Chris did. and thank you. for being a stand up man. we need more if that in this world.
Will, pride and entitlement will keep you from being able to relate to people like Chris on a real human level. Stop acting, you're in denial. Put yourself in others feet so you can feel how it is to be anyone but you. There is healing and forgiveness once a person in humbled. Are you there yet?
Being a public figure comes with extremes that I can only imagine. People you don't know love or hate you with the utmost intensity, and they usually do so because of a single moment in your life. I don't envy it.
GOAT
Did will smith head get bigger?
You were gas lit into striking a man on National TV 🤦🏽 our people will never live this down
This still seems to be all about you. Listen to how many times you say “I”.
As someone who had a lot of respect for you prior to this incident I was really disappointed when this happened but forgiveness is one of the most important parts of being a human. I have respect for you taking time to understand yourself and apologize. Sometimes things don’t have a fix or an answer and that’s okay. Continue to be yourself and keep your head up and you’ll continue to be a role model for young people like you have been.
Good day Sir👍🏽
I love how there was a WATER advertisement at the same time...
Taking ownership and responsibility is exactly how we begin healing. Thank you for being a good example of why and how important it is for you to do that.
Hey in this world its totally ok...what u doin for supper?
YouTube Apology Video (Will Smith Edition)
Now that's how you apologize.  Even if the other person was wrong you can't let people control your actions or emotions. At the same time we're all human and there's only so much a person can take. Peace to Will Smith, let's keep it moving.
You’re one of the people I want to meet before my times up on this earth. You’re human, you made a mistake, and you’ve accepted accountability. That’s what a true sign of maturity is about, thank you for holding yourself accountable and owning your truth.
Love you !
Will, this took courage. You’re human and we all make mistakes. The mistake doesn’t define you. How you move forward and rectify any mistake is what defines you.   You still have my support.
They’ll be laughing about it in 10 years at one of their “roasts”
It definitely was a pos move, but with that said we have all had a less than shining moment where we allow our emotions to take over causing actions that were embarrassing and out of character. Chris deserves time to deal and ppl need to allow him that grace. And even if Chris never wants to speak to Will again, that’s his right because that moment was EXTREMELY humiliating. None the less, I still am a fan of both Chris and Will and this too will pass.
Love you Will. I don't know how one action could change anyone's opinion of you after decades of princely behavior
You made a mistake and you were man enough to admit it and trying your best to make it right. wishing you all the best!
This should have been done right after it happened not months later just saying
🙏 one love💖
It’s kind of you to offer and explanation, underserved. This is insane.
Well said.
I wonder what money he lost that he’s making this video now 🤔
The angle of front view making this apology little bit jokey 😆
His voice was broken and  so  is his  soul 😔😔😔 May  all  be  able  to learn  from  the past  and  be healed ❤❤
Man can't just accept Chris doesnt want to talk and has to do this big show about it.
I don't like to give advice to someone I don't know...But honestly...it looks like you need a divorce.
It’s Morbin time
So, the man has been doing a lot of "personal work"... I'm surprised he didn't use the go-to "I've educated myself more about..." excuse that celebrities use whenever they screw up something these days. This is equally lame. If you needed this much time to come up with this, you should've just left it as is.
Go Will!  👏🏼
What type of work on yourself are you doing to make sure that you behave like that in the future?
There is something seriously wrong with this guy…hollyweird
Dont blame yourself I think that you did everything right
I do not get it. What is this remorse without shame? "Shame"; a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the consciousness of wrong or foolish behavior. This is exactly how one should feel after such behavior. It is a prick of the conscience. It means you have one.  But feeling shame does not mean you are not entitled to make mistakes. Feelings cause you to learn from those mistakes and hopefully never make them again.
Hard working broken man that has all his faults publicly shown we all make our own bed… time to start from the bottom again. Keep fighting and keep moving forward.  An official and proper apology resets it all. Lean on that and get back up.
I've got nothing but love for you Will, but this doesn't come off as sincere.  It comes off as you're trying to protect your image.  Otherwise, you would've spoken to or written Chris privately.  This isn't something you have to address with your fans nor should you have.  Now it just looks like you're trying to score points with the public and it's not really fair to take something fucked up that you did and try to turn it into something that will benefit you regardless of the fact that this probably isn't your motive and you just aren't thinking clearly.
I grew up watching this man, his interviews his films all of it.. Lost so much respect for him when this happened, this does feel like a small step in the right direction tho!
We're all human, and life gives us lessons to learn and grow from. Keep Shining and stay blessed. One love my brother ✌🏾💜
Glad to see you back mate!
Ljudi se hrane tudjom mukom i rado osudjuju, narocito ako je licnost popularna kao vi mr Smith. Shvatam zasto ste uradili to sto ste uradili i ako ste, niko ne sme da zbija sale na racun supruge koja se voli a narocito kada je tesko bolesna.  Moj zivot je bio pun opasnosti koje sam nadvladao ali iskreno ne bih imao "muda" da uradim to sto ste vi i zato vam skidam kapu 👍.
People are going to look at this as ridiculous.
Public Relations Stunt will have it's intended effect. Will Won
It’ll get better I promise. It wasn’t the best thing that happened, but it could’ve been worse. Far as I’m concerned you’re already forgiven 🙏
Everyone makes mistakes, Your a good man Will , god bless you
love you my guy
Aye Will...  Divorce ya baby momma, bruh. 👌🏾
Big angry guy
❤️❤️
Good to see you back man. Just letting you know, we all love you
Will, as a fan, I was deeply disappointed and upset by this horrific action.  As a teacher, I had to deal with the repercussions of this, in the classroom.  Some students felt that this was acceptable behavior because you did it.  As a teacher, in a majority black and brown school, those same students who felt this behavior is acceptable, this behavior was amplified that much more because you are someone they look up to.  We would appreciate more conversation as you continue to unpack this.   On behalf of me, a fan, thank you.  I find this sincere and truthful.
You have always been one of my favorite male actors. The fact that you were able to take accountability which is something a lot in this world struggles with I truly appreciate that. We are all imperfect but you still showed accountability. One of the reasons that I love and even more so makes me respect you. Way to go will
I have always been such a big fan of you and I’m so happy you made this video. Never get discouraged, people will always love when someone falls down. Get back up and move on, everything will be alright. No one is perfect, it’s just unfortunate your life is in the lens of the world. God bless and keep, keeping on. Much love
Mens mental health is important and is always overlooked.. im glad your getting the help you deserve. We all make mistakes and it takes courage to admit when you have done something wrong. Youre a strong man and im happy youre getting better little by little 💖
You made a mistake we all make them. You’ve apologised and reached out. Stand tall and love yourself again we all love you. ❤️
Praying for you my brother. Keep doing your work to be whole. We all make mistakes. You are made in the image of God, you are enough, and you are loved.
I love u man, stay strong even though u might think people don't admire you anymore , its not true because your past works and your book are still earning you more fans ... you are amazing and your true supporters do not feel you let them down.
Lol all nonsense
We always love u man...
Appreciate you doing this  video. Praying for you, Will.
Why is he talking like that lol
Love you bro!
Kinda feels like I’m watching a YouTuber apology video haha
Don't allow your mind to get in the way of YOUR overall progress. You made a mistake. You're owning it. Life is good. Much Love my friend!
I gave you flag for what you did … and I stand by it … but you gave me so many happy moments and regardless of what happened … I still look up to you will … it’s good to see you back! Let us see more of you once again my man ! Missed you
Is this video sponsored by "Just Water", Jaden Smith's Water company. There sure is good product placement in the video like 0:40 angled right at the camera next to you.
Love ya, Will. Most of us were never angry with you!
Bro Chris was literally roasting you on stage a couple days ago😂he is not talking to you
lâche !
I’m guessing that you have realised how much this has really cost you now all the doors that were once open to you are now firmly closed.   Unfortunately Hollywood and the world may (if you are lucky) forgive, but will never forget the boundary that you crossed.   Chris has already told you that he is not prepared to talk with you at this moment, yet your lack of self control and restraint has caused you to release this video. Personally I think it would have been nobler to wait for an audience and (again with luck) a reconciliation with Chris in private before reopening this discussion in the public domain.  I’d like to think that your message came from a good place and not because of the catastrophic financial impact your behaviour has had on the “Will Smith” brand.   Like I said, some fans may forgive, but you have worked in business where image is everything and in a world where aggressive and toxic behaviour has little tolerance. Personally, I wish you well, but I do not wish to see you perform again.   I recommend that you continue to come to terms that this chapter of your life and its lifestyle as it was has come to an end and find new projects and purpose in your life.
Thank you! Good strong! You are not a piece of sh@!!! Good man!
i am sorry babe still didnt learnt his lesson lmfao
I understand you Will. I’ve been publicly shamed before although I’m just a regular person. The world turns against you and all you have is you. Not a good feeling. I can identity with how you feel now in every way. Blessings towards you and the family.
I understand bro... good to see you getting better as we all do every day... keep your head up greater days are yet to come.
I hate letting people down too. The punishment we put ourselves through when we do let people down is unimaginable for those who don’t know. Keep your head up man 🙏
Ya fue will, que lo malo quede atras, bien por ti en pedir disculpas ojala chriis sepa entender, la funcion debe continuar para ambos..
Will, you will be forgiven that why we have grace. You are amazing for this open talk. Thank you and you will always be loved.
So he finally realised that no one's gonna be wanting to work with him. Went into career saving mode.
Will scusa puoi mettere un attimo il braccio così???
Stans unite! Protect the precious.
Way too late
Thank you for all the positivity that you have put into this world and taking the time for yourself that you needed before releasing this. I hope you have gotten to the place where you forgive yourself for what happened. We all fall at points and that's okay. It's going to take work to move past this, but I know that you will. You got this Will!
Love ❤️ Will Smith good people make mistakes, God is still able 🙏, y'all he's asking for forgiveness,  and God will
Bou time my guy.
I understand why you did it. It was unacceptable, but I understood why you did it.  You are a family man.  I am sorry it was handled in the way it happen.   I can never judge you based on ONE bad behavior.  You're still okay with me.
You should have apologized a long time ago
Seems sincere, everyone makes mistakes.
Better late than never I suppose.
❤❤❤❤
We love you Will!!!!!
4 months too late.
First YouTube apology video that seems genuine
I hope everyone affected can work things out.
❤️
This guy is a robot…I used to be a big fan but not anymore
Stay up Will!! Much love ❤️
Bout time took long enough
You’re a real man Will, apology accepted. I’ll watch king Richard this weekend 🙂
Hollywood double standards at it again, charges should have been pressed.  I don't expect my comment will stick around as it seems they're being cleaned out in real time.
WE ARE NOT PERFECT WE ARE HUMAN WE MAKE MISTAKES AND WE LEARN
This wasn’t a mistake. It was a meltdown. You are not addressing why this was able to actually occur. What lead you to make that decision. You are just apologising in long form to drive engagement on your YouTube channel.
Good actor. He should win an award
Bem feito, aprendeu que o mundinho não é seu e que faz oq bem entender kkkkkkkkkkkk
Your my childhood hero man. You could have done anything and id still love you . Were all human even you. Even heros make mistakes.
even the strongest of us fall.
I wish the best for you so why not just retire? You can chill, travel, relax somewhere.
A applaud you! Cowards rejoice when a hero falls.
You are a good person just learn and grow from our part mistakes👍🏽💆🏽 just make it right with Chris🫡
Well this was scripted asf. Took u three months for this brah?
It’s been 3 months, quite frankly pathetic
Will is still the GOAT
You da man!
You are wonderful.  A badly written page does not make a man, the entire book does.  And your book is filled with PHENOMENAL PAGES!!  You are a wonderfully loving man who is ready for more greatness.  Thank you for showing more of your unlimited humanity.
Thanks Will.
Yeesh... I heard that stressful sigh in the intro. It even had the shake on the end. You need a vacation in nature bro. Seriously.
It’s not really my place to forgive you. But I do forgive you ❤️
Still look up to you. You're a great man and father and performer. Never a problem me being a fan. Hope this gets better soon. You're the man
We need an apology from your son because he said “yeah this is how we do it”.
Somehow this still feels gross.  Opens by making a point that he reached out to Chris and shared Chris's response that he's not ready.  Still very much a manipulative play so he keeps the ball in his court.  This is absolutely gross.
You can’t WILL SMITH your way out of this one. Things will be different from now on…along with the apologies I hope there is changed behavior… maybe you do need shame …. I did
You lost my respect and never done that too late for your apology
That was a crap apology lol. And it took you 3 months to apologize? Or has it taken 3 months for this to officially affect your pocket book? Lol
I still love you Will!
This man is human. He has a lot of stress for years and years.  I understand. He just had the last straw
I've got your back Will <3  one mistake won't erase years of stellar behaviour on and off screen
Proud of you Will.  To other celebrities (black community) I dont commend how you talked down about a black man..your black brother..  Everyone makes mistakes.. Wills actions didn't define him and don't define him
why u dressed like Tiger Woods daddy? 👕
Never stopped loving you will your a inspiration to us all and a legendary figure for our community
God is good. He knows why we are the way we are and he loves us anyway. Rely on Him to help you get through this. Look to the scriptures for His answer. Psalm 34:18 says: “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; He saves those who are crushed in spirit.”
It takes a lot of class, maturity, and courage to apologize publicly. I wish you all the best, Will and God bless you. :)
He should hire Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson as counselors... it would help him get his stuff together.
Why did this take damn near 6 months?? He should've did this the week of...that being said, I'm not convinced. At all. People try to say it's just one mistake, but it's the magnitude of that mistake. Will doesn't have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people he hurt behind this...and the fact that he has the nerve to mention his own pain in this moment is insulting in itself. His so called "pain" takes a back seat to everyone else's right now...especially considering how long you took in your attempt to make things right. Too little, too late...🤷🏾‍♂️
Being ashamed, when learning from it, makes one a better person.
Took you long enough. Problem is it makes you look more like your apology is for your reputation than actually apologizing. If anything Chris deserves the award for taking it like a man.
❤
you should leave that woman youre with
I liked how he apologized to Chris rocks mother
still a GOAT
I just watched the serious version of the “The Fresh Prince” called “Bel Air” and I think Will truly is the grown up version of that character. It’s impossible to stay mad a Will Smith.
Never stopped being your friend in the first place Will.......
You nice. LOL. I would hold this same interview and supplant I'm sorry with "I WOULD F YOU UP". You would have let your self and family down if you kept letting them DISRESPECT YOU. Family memebers who lost someone that took their life over bullying wish they had done what you did. They live with the regret they didn't. I would sleep soundly knowing my family member know's they are love, supported, and protected. That's more important to me than any friendship, money, or accolade. I don't want to be friends with anyone that is ok with hurting someone that is at peace with you. You might not be ok with me hurting someone that is hurting someone that is at peace with them. I will sleep soundly with the fact you can SMD.
You are and always will be a role model to my son and to me!  We still love you sir and a one time bad decision will NOT change that.  My son is grown now and has 3 kids of his own and he has looked up to you his whole life... we still love you and we know that your heart is right and your intentions have always been good...  this too shall pass....  Remember that God works all things together for good to those who love Him.... Your gonna be alright... much love and respect ALWAYS.
Apologies should be just as loud as the disrespect and come just as swiftly. This is too quiet and too late....
Sincere admiration for your humility . You are the epitome of humble and accountability . 👑
How are there currently 19k views but 26k upvotes?  Anyway - it's gonna be okay Will! I hope you and Chris can mend your relationship
That sit down will be something positive for sure. I hope they work things out. You were missed, Will.
The most significant thing Will could have done is explain why he went off the rails.
You should be in jail
Takes a big man to apologize, work on himself and figure out how to move forward. I appreciate that you're even taking the time to make this video, it's hard to live in the spot light. ❤️
Damn I wish I was rich enough to not go to jail for my mistakes too 🤣 scientology freak.
We all have are moments wish we could of or should of have done better. Hopefully someday soon all parties can forgive, forget and move on, life is to short.
Still love you Will!
Wasn’t willing to look past his behavior until I heard this. Time to forgive
You have more integrity than most people who stood in front of a camera and shunned you. You are my role model because you are strong enough to be vulnerable.
15k dislikes already btw for anyone who wants to know the real ratio since yt doesn't want u to see it lol

It's okay now. You just happened to go through publicly.
euh a la base c'est qui l'idiot qui a balancé une blague de merde ? vraiment n'importe quoi si maintenant c'est les victimes qui doivent s'excuser de s'etre emporté !! en france tu serais considéré comme un bonhomme qui a defendu sa femme point barre !
You made a mistake, it just happened to be very public.  It doesn't affect my enjoyment of your work.
I hope this is your last public apology.  No part of me believes you are in anyway accepting, let alone proud, of what you did.  For years I've watched you grow into an outstanding and admirable man. We all make mistakes, and I for one will not define you by this one.  Power on. You are an asset to millions 💞
To err is human,to forgive is Divine
I didn't apologize to Chris during my acceptance speech BECAUSE I,  Will , am a MEGA JERK🤷‍♀️ simple as that!
Everyone needs to get in a room, hug it out and move on.
*We all have our moments. Love you, man.*
I love you Will! I stand by you 1000% percent always
Waiting to be friends with you again :)
We ALL make mistakes
Would look a little better without the Water placement ad, just saying
how about you take another 50 yrs?
You made a show of yourself and for what?
Keep your head up Will. We all make mistakes. It’s part of life. Do not allow yourself to live with guilt. Make peace. May God bless you and your family, and Chris and his family.
Is all good will, we all makes mistakes...the good thing is that you recognize your mistakes...much love to you will...
We love you Will. We appreciate you. It’s hard to be always in good standing everyday it’s a fight in which you win most of them. We have love for both you and Chris and hope you two become close again
You did it can't take it back ,move on forgave yourself first ,then move on to the other people ,that they forgave you ,pray to God and get to know him and his son Jesus . Give a Bible and read the his word .
I love you so much !!
What did the five fingers say to the face?
We love you Will! Come back better and stronger, that's the mission.
Wonder if this video is monetized 🤣
you got this!
thank you for taking your time and for this message <3
I don't know what to feel.. but I know something: everybody deserve a second chance :)
Will, with all due respect, you are absolutely fogged out. Snap out of it! Dont try to make sense where there is none.. I understand  trying to be accepting and supportive of lifestyles, but its doing more harm than good.
Everyone makes mistakes, it's not how big the mistake is, but what we do to fix our mistake!!   You're an inspiration and I know you will continue to be for generations.
We’re still cool
It's all speculation from my point of view but a few things I have an opinion on are:  If apologies don't seem to be enough then listen to your gut. Try something more. Try thanking the person or people you want to apologize to. Thank them for putting up with such behavior. Thank them all for being the better people. Thank them for showing compassion towards you by not pressing charges. Thank them for having clarity in a moment when your world was a haze. Try telling them that what they had to go through had to have been exceptionally hard. It takes a lot for a person to say sorry. It takes even more for a person to admit when they're wrong. It takes quite a bit more of a man to put themselves in another person's shoes and understand how things happened on their end.  Expecting someone to just talk after something like that is a lot to ask of a person. I 100 percent believe you feel remorseful for what you did but it seems just saying I'm sorry isn't the way to go.
Dang, I guess anyone can just apologize to the public 6 months later and not the person he wronged and call it a day
Ahhh come here you little rascal i forgive you!
Will meant every word.... BRIGHT 2!!!!!
Tiger Woods multiverse
This apology comes as a response for all the money loss. Disgraceful!
Your still an amazing man who is just human. God got you and your going to come back from this.
You are human Will. You will forever be a great role model to me and my family. God bless you brother.
"I apologize to my sponsors, the academy, the movie studios. Please don't drop me and rehire me"
30 years in the spotlight, you’ve always conducted yourself with grace. yes what happened was unfortunate(you and Chris are my favourites), but you are human. It’s not your damn job to be peoples role model- they’ve got their parents for that. Anybody who would discredit 30 years of positivity for one mistake isn’t someone’s opinion you should value. Hope you’ve been able to heal, realise your real friends and also gained some sense of freedom from this. Thanks for being an inspiration Willard ❤️
❤❤❤
too little too late sorry doesnt cut it to all of us that have dealt with behaviours like that sorry not sorry is what i hear
Yes she did.... subliminally. She indirectly did it. I like her too but she is also to be blamed!!
Maybe.  It's a good start but until Chris is ready to talk, just stay at home or working on yourself.
Will Smith didn't deserve the hate he got period
It shows at the end of day you are only human, no one is perfect.  To be honest i first thought  it was staged . It was a bit of a shock . For me I feel there was more to it.  totally out of character not that i know you ha. I hope you and your family are good. I hope you and Chris and mend this.  Peace ...
Will that night was a case study for astrologers worldwide since such a public class was on display for everyone and for years to come. I hope you have someone in your life able to communicate this to you.  You can find me: at twelvedimensions
Love Will Smith...dats y I didn't comment about dat situation 💪
All love Will … keep your head up GOAT 🐐
🗑️🗑️🗑️
I sympathize
Even the best of us vent our anger in ways that are hurtful to others. You're still one of the good guys Will.
This is the most Manley thing I've ever seen... Period... Thank you Mr. Will ... For even in your darkest moment showing us the proper way to handle things ...
here before it goes viral
GUTS!!...Good for you and yo you💪🏻
No matter what is going on in your life right now. You’re important and you do matter. ❤️
Love you WILL! I truly believe you just made a mistake , we don’t know how you were feeling beforehand . Anger does a lot of things.   Hopefully he forgives you and you guys can move past this.  Most importantly forgive yourselves 💕
We still love you, my man!
KEEP CHRIS’ BROTHER’S NAME OUT YA FUCKIN MOUTH!
💯💪🏾
Why is the video so dark or is it it just my screen? Anyhow, hopefully ya'll can hug it out. Otherwise, a civil suite may be headed your way. Take care!
Get over this and back in the saddle. Nobody is perfect and you have a huge platform to bring positivity to this world. Out of all of your accomplishments this will not be a defining moment.
Dear Will Smith, I understand the pressure you put on yourself to live up to people's expectations that match or better your own expectations of yourself. Just know that a lot of people are very much rooting for your to come back stronger and bring more of yourself to the table. We're all human, and certainly make choices that dont represent who we would like to be, but we dont live under the microscope like your family does. That is not an easy existence. We are each still growing & learning throughout every day of our lives. It is OKAY to be human. And I think you're doing a great job to excavate, fix, repair, and restore not only yourself, but others who were affected by your actions. Keep it up sir. Salute to you!
Mr. Smith, we all stumble, your stumble just happened to be in front of millions. You seem sincere in your apology, you always seemed like a good-natured person. I never considered you "soft" I did not know that was something that was constantly thrown at you. Try not to carry guilt for a long time about that night. keep in mind, "This too shall pass"✌
Ay, props Will. This takes guts to do man. Especially with everything going on in the country, the world and the way things are on the internet. Just keep pushing man
We all make mistakes in life Will. It takes a man with a big heart to admit it. It is obvious you are hurting. I hope you and all those involved find peace and forgiveness. You still have my respect.
Thank you for this video! You are the best Will! You apologized to the right people. I'm still one of your fans and i still watch your movies! You are a great actor and you are a good human being! We all make mistakes but we can fix them! No one is perfect in this world! I know what it is to be angry at people because i got bullied when was a kid because i'm high functioning autism with asperger sydrome and this is why i got to anger management therapy years later as an adult! You are a great man and i can't wait to see you in your next movies in the future! You still have my respect!💯
This is a very bold drop
How deep this is, is extremely laughable
Thank you Will for doing this. At 56 you have been the only celebrity I truly admire, for years. This is a big deal!
Hate when people say "i apologize". Its an awful word and seems so insincere.  "i am sorry"  is better i think.
It takes man to admit his faults and own it. I just pray he doesn’t keep getting crucified over and over again and that grace and forgiveness will prevail. We are all broken in some way. He may be famous but he puts his pants on one leg at a time like all of us and needs grace 🙏🏽
You could NEVER be a piece of @#!&. God don't make mess and he created you perfectly in HIS image. You made a mistake and it was displayed on live television. Congratulations on your award and the movie was incredible.
HOW MANY LAWERS DID IT TAKE TO WRITE THIS ?? !!
S!mp ! (see: vide0)
This was extremely sincere. I can see your genuinely sorry. I was really disappointed AND I forgive you. Water under the bridge. Don’t let this be your story cause it’s not
It was just so jarring.. But it feels like the world is wobbling on it's axis right now and this was more of a symptom of that rather than a cause. Everyone is on edge.. Politically and societally because of the pandemic and the response. Everything is 180 out of phase and it feels like no one is reaching out a hand to come together. We're cancelling anything we don't want to deal with.  So this was for sure just another security blanket that was yanked out from under us. We're running out.
The ULTIMATE HEALING will be for those two, Will and Chris ... to sit down with ANOTHER BLACK MALE HOST/MODERATOR ... and talk to the culture about ALL SIDES of that moment. Historically, Spiritually, Emotionally ... and talk about the Toxic Masculinity that creates that response as an option ... the Emasculation of Black Males that allows the acceptance of that kind of  behavior toward them through centuries of oppression and WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE, as a culture. Make no mistake ... this is a VERY TEACHABLE moment and it needs to be SERIOUSLY addressed.
What you did was a bad split second decision. But, owning up to it like this shows a real depth of character. I hope the wounds created by that incident are able to heal. For Chris, yourself, and all involved.
Take care and be kind to yourself. We will be right here  , we have your back.. i saw the footage . What shocked me is realising that you are being abused and controlled by a narcissist.  Please watch HG tudor analysis and the body language guy analysis of it and know that you have people who do have your back.
bro bout to break the internet
Oh no, are opportunities and money running low big fella?
Thanks for exposing even more how GROSS Hollywood is. Everyone that gave you a standing ovation should be ashamed of themselves. This apology should have been done that night to Chris. 3 months later? GTFO! I can't wait for his new standup and I hope he rips you to shreds. 😎🤘
I took king Richard off my watchlist because of what you did.  You lost a fan.
*_WILL, THERE'S NO SHAME IN CHANGE._* 🫂
Awww apology accepted. I forgive you. Yeah it was crazy and jaw-dropping to watch, but I am still a fan. I still think you fine and still want to be with you and have your kids. 😂. I am still looking forward to the next installment of Bad Boys. I am glad you looked within and are healing. That part makes all the difference. Love and Light to you Will.
Red table talk episode uploading...
ITS F*CK WILL SMITH TILL THE DEATH OF ME.
Happiness and forgiveness are decisions.
Everybody makes mistakes we love you Will ❤️
Ya still a legend 👍❤️
We love you so much Will! So much respect for you!
he's only apologizing now because he got a project coming out
Love you and support you always!!! First of all you are not perfect no one is, so; apologies as a fan of you are accepted. Don’t let a mistake made to define who you are…love you !!!
Respect Bro Respect we all made a mistake or two 🤝🏾💯
He’s human and made a monumental mistake. But we all have stumbled and fallen short of Gods glory. We are all on a different journey and there are rises and falls throughout the journey that we learn from. Love you Will. Be better and continue spreading love.
Someone told me something very profound.  There's a difference between an "apology" and "asking forgiveness".   An apology is merely an expression of regret, but "asking forgiveness" humbles you and seeks reconciliation.  If you asked Chris for forgiveness, the ball is no longer in your court, it's in his.  The decision to keep this going would then rest upon him.  It also, would cause Chris to examine himself and consider - what would it take to make this right, and what example could this set for everyone. "To err is human, to forgive is divine".
its ok we all make mistakes
You can't restart your life, this is nor super mario. Goodbye and happy retirement!
Will I get the apology, but don't beat yourself up. Humans make mistakes all the time god has for given you.
We love you will!
You were not thinking is not an excuse for a grown man. Too late, take the consequences.
As someone wised said: Is it too late now to say sorry?
You will pay for what you did one way or another, lucky for you. You will never be in a deficit because of that. you took something from chris that he will never get back.
You messed up Will but hopefully you continue creating great films in the future. I respect your craft tremendously.
❤❤
As a fan of Will Smith for almost 30yrs, wanting to be just like Will Smith, my heart was broken that night and I was really let down.... Now to see him Man up and face his mistake and apologize from the heart.... I salute you for this...
It's sad that this is gonna get memed into oblivion soon...
Love hearing from you again Will! Can’t even imagine how these last few months have been for you. I’m glad that you’ve taken the time and I hope that you’re feeling better. I’m proud of you and I look up to you. Take care 💜
Lol yoooo you could of just called him and forgotten about this. This is soooo performative and over produced
We love you will♥️♥️♥️
Will Smith has always been real. I have a lot of respect for him. He took accountability. Especially a while after. He didn't rush it to clear himself. Very genuine.
Wills a good guy that made a bad mistake. It doesn’t change who he is
Everyone is sorry when their career is going down the drain
Love you will. Good to hear from you.
we love you will!!!!!
RESPECT 🥺 I just love how you're super honest with yourself even if it hurts, this is what I've learned to do this year it's a painful process but it's therapeutic.  I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself because I'm human 😭 now this takes Great mental and emotional stability 🙏🏾 Stay strong WILL I'm sending you my love and positive energy.
Only nice comments stay, right?? You monster!
We love you. We’ve already forgiven you. You will always constantly be an inspiration to me personally and I’m sure anyone that looks up to you like myself. Keep positivity going strong. We’re still your friend
We all stumble sometime,  I  choose to not judge a man by his worst day but by his character and worth.  For decades Will has shown to be a caring man and I could tell how badly this hurt him. Thanks for all the great times and I for one can't wait to see what is next.
Always gonna love you Will. Like, you said, you’re human and there’s some personal trauma there. What is grace, if we can’t extend it forward. You may be a celeb, a role model, someone in the spotlight, but you’re still human and humans make mistakes. It takes a real humble person to see the mistake, admit to it, take responsibility and try their hardest to come forward and admit that on a platform where there will be negativity no matter what you say or how you say it. For what it’s worth, I believe in you. And I believe you will come back from this. Not for me or for anyone else necessarily, but because we all know you’re better than this. And it takes a real man to step up and take responsibility for his actions and be better from it. One step at a time, one hour at a time, one day at a time. Your fans are here for you. To pray for you. To love you. To encourage you. To await the time we can see again and not feel ashamed. ❤️
Too little too late this shoulda dropped a week after it happened
Much respect to you, yes you are human, keep your head up,praying for you. 🙏🏽
When you walk around with a higher temperature, it doesn’t take much for a man to boil.
Wow not a single negative comment here, the reality filter is doing a good job hiding stuff, I honestly don't care all this elite drama, Ijust found peculiar (and really suspicious) all the comments are of love and support.
Ppp loan gone out on Tubi for free & AMAZON! #Comedy
thank you,,,,role model
He say's all in one: HE IS A HUMAN, HE MAKE MISTAKES like all of us.
this is complete bs, he's just trying to get attention from this. YOU AREN'T GOING TO RECOVER
Still the king ❤🔥🔥
you need to feel shame
Brother stay strong ... we are humans and we aren't perfect. Take Care and much love for you and for family; thanks for this video.
Takes a man to do this salute 🙏 will 💪🤙💪life's not over
This was a great message of favouring healthy guilt over toxic shame.  We love you will. So much.
Sounds like an actor reading a script but surely based on these comments they're deleting all negative ones
Defending Family, needs no apology. People think that you are a machine with no feelings... Well they'll have to  think twice now.
We’ve all made mistakes. Sending Love & compassion to everyone involved. 🤍
I like will but we all know he is only doing this video to save jada's name. She belongs to the streets..
I see all these "no body is perfect" excuses which is correct but I can't help but feel yall say that for Will because yall like him. If someone else you couldnt care for did this ish....idk man.
It took a lot of courage to do this video Will. RESPECT
I think Questlove deserves a direct apology more than anyone. That was an outstanding accomplishment he had worked his entire career for. He deserves more than an apology.
5 minutes and still didn't say why you did it ... all I hear is hollow words. I can't believe you actually got to walk away with an award ... smh
Much love Will
You were human! He pushed you and got what he had coming!!!!
Ok Will Smith I hear you. Although you deeply disappointed us, we will hold on and hope we become friends again.
Terrible of you in the first place will
Funny thing is I read his book and it really brings clarity to Will's journey. Check it out, very insightful!!!
The fact that someone like Travis Scott has basically been forgiven for carrying on a concert when 9 people died, and people were still talking about this for months after it happened should just tell you everything about the world.
We love you Will... You are human and allowed to make mistakes.... No one is meant to be perfect... You've put in too much work for us to ever turn our backs on you...
Not cool will .. But im glad you're admitting to the mistake made as long as its genuine ..Ive always been a fan of you're work and wish you the best for the future .. maybe just without the negative factors in it !!  peace :)
Great acting skills. Turned himself into the victim of the situation. "I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself". Seriously? You shouldn't be ashamed of yourself?
Love you will!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I still support you Will and continue to pray for the better and achieve your goals
No one's perfect bro. All the joy and happiness you have brought to the world over your lifetime. Real people make mistakes, and own them, and we move on.
How does this video have 18k views and 24k likes. Just asking because the math throws me off……
KEEP IT UP WILL! AFTER ALL YOU'VE NEVER LET ME DOWN, IM GLAD YOU TOOK YOUR TIME TO SPEAK. You're human after all.
Just as we criticized you for your actions, I think it is only fair that we applor you for this as well. Just like you I to grew up with my grandmama and the one thing she also said to me over and over again, is that "it takes a strong person to notice their wrong and find it within themselves to apologize to those they've hurt, you're not weak because you do so but that is what makes you strong". You the man Will ✊🏼
No one has to like you and many of us no longer do. This is a lesson for all of Hollywood.
Damn ☹️ y'all ack like he rape someone we all make mistakes we love you big will.
Hey listen we love Chris and we love you we are all brothers threw Christ sometimes brothers fight also when we make mistakes we are going threw a moment of imperfection that makes us human all you can due is sincerely apologize and ask the most high for forgiveness time heals all things my brother will peace and love to you and your entire family… and if his mom doesn’t except don’t worry parents just don’t understand 😂 had to throw some humor in … love peace and happiness
I love you Uncle Will ❤
Then go party somemore, I am sorry and tried listening, but you lost something at you bringing up you.  Not going to beat yourself up ... nobody would ever ask for that, but keep saying that a few more times as it is very you.
Come to Chile for a little mushroom trip....you'll realize it's ok.
Problem with the world is we focus on the bad so much and diminish the good , Mr Smith you have been my role model my whole life n honestly see no wrong that was amplified to the degree that it was . You’re awesome and have spread more love and happiness in the world than sorrow . Just a shame bad news travels faster than good . But us we see the glass as half full always not empty . Keep on keeping on sir . You’re a walking living GIANT .!!  I’ll stay hanging on sir😉
You are still outstanding, and one of those that have inspired me most! This didn’t change that for me. As you say.. you are a human! ❤️ Hope to see you back soon. Much love from Norway😃
US ME FOR DISLIKE
lol He must be seeing the loss of revenue!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Reacting to an insult ? Imagine if Ricky Gervais was hosting! That was the trend of award shows all year and last year. Will you been my idol , but that apology doesn't explain a lot and leaves room for more speculation... but whatever it is hope you have your demons in check. I'm guessing you will never be able to honestly discuss it in public unless you throw someone under the bus and reveal details of your private life ... but we love you man, we know that ain't you.  If you can get chris to forgive you this will soon be forgotten.
There's something about him that feels like he's going to break out in his happy self at any moment.  He may actually recover from this and everything will be forgotten and forgiven.
Perfect example of being human and learning from a bad mistake💯💯
You never explained why you did it in the first place
Will, I've always in my own way followed you as if you were my big brother. I always imagined that if I had one, he would be like you. I was one of the folks who was shocked and disappointed by your move but I never stopped loving you, brother. Bad move, indeed but I would still follow you through any maze. In fact, I still do. I love you big brother. Thank you for the apology and as far as I go it is deeply accepted. I'm following you... where we going next? 💪🏾❤️
i fux with u will no matter what bro u jave done a hell of alot in this business for the youth as well as far as inspiration keep ya head up and dont stop being greatness forever the great fresh prince im waiting on belair season 2 homie much love out the fla
We STLL love you brotha
Keep my wife's name out yo mouth!
Enough....
Well said, first one without sin cast the first stone, your great works will not be tarnish in a Hollywood society that have many flaws, reset and reload brother...straight like that!!
Nope.
Power my King just fix your crown 👑
poor guy he doesn't deserve this. the perfect example of what women can do to you. they may make you a better person or a laughing stock
Welcome back,, you are still the man! 💘  you! God bless you
Even though it was a hurtful moment between brothers it was a human moment. You may never see this Will, but I truly hope you don’t let this mistake undermine all that you done throughout your career. Respect ✊🏾 for facing all the consequences. You still a King Prince!
Well spoken. It's all learning and healing and at the end of the day, forward is the way. That moment doesn't define you or Chris. I hope, even if amends aren't made, that there is healing and hatchet burying from this.
Well better late than never. We’re only human and we all make mistakes. I hope Chris reaches out soon and the book can be closed.
That took heart, good for you. You're not a POS, you made a real bad decision in a moment of weakness, welcome to the human experience. Forgive yourself and live to be better, that's all you can do. I pray you and Chris can both heal from this as well as all who were affected.
You’re a good man, a great one. People make mistakes. You’re gonna rebound as well as the best of us could!
We love all of you still… This is what remorse looks like. There is still room for you all to make this world great 👍 Love 💕 you Will Smith !
This is the best acting from his career so far
Will we still love you Brother!!! Everyone makes mistakes 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Nothing wrong with being ashamed of yourself when you screw up, that's how you know you're not a sociopath. The trick is not to beat yourself up over it! You have to forgive yourself too.
Im going to be 100 with you Will, im not the type of person to follow or even care what the rich and famous do, but for what its worth, I always respected you and looked up to you, I knew you had your issues like we all do, we’re all human. But with that said, I’m not going to lie, it really did suck that you shattered your image with one single action. I’m sure you will never read this, but I do hope that one day you can be who you worked so hard to be, because right now I can tell you that not a lot of people like you like they did before, not just here, but around the world. Hope things get better for you.
This is nothing but pandering. Now he’s putting the responsibility on Chris by apologizing in a public manner.
Oh please. Complexities and nuances of what happened? He got up and smacked up a guy on national TV. This therapy speak is embarrassing.
CHRIS DIDN'T CARE ABOUT WHO HE HURT. CHRIS DESERVED IT!!! HE WAS GOING TO KEEP SLIGHTING YOU UNTIL YOU MADE  HIM STOP! YOUR KIDS WERE THERE TOO! HE STILL DIDN'T CARE!
Thank you! you have proved again to be a good persona and a role model...it's easy to make a mistake but it takes strong and deep courage to stand up and apologize...specially in your position and in front of the whole world. Keep your head up.
Stay strong Will. We all make mistakes.
Dunno how i feel about this. The sitting in front of the camera, the deep sigh, him looking to his left every 5 seconds like he's reading of a script (that he probably didn't write) are all classic manipulation tactics that so many apology videos have. I'm not saying he isn't genuine but it does come across that way.
Can’t even say it to his face
Be strong
May the LORD grant you HIS peace. Watching you share these things with such vulnerability knowing how savage this world IS, is encouraging. But the mother in me just wants to hug you and shield you from the foolery. I pray you continue to walk out this journey of healing. Hopefully you and Chris can move past this moment. Thank you for letting your apology be LOUDER than your mistake.
🙏💛👑
We love you will smith ❤️
I love you, Will. Keep doing the work. It’s good to see you.
I never questioned you. Actions in the moment we all have had them. I’m just glad to see you again. Looking forward to seeing you more. As Bishop O.T. Jones (Philly) would say…’all is known, all is forgiven’.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Glad you are trying to reach out to Chris. He deserves it, but I hope he finds it in his heart to welcome you back. Just like you, he is known to be a stellar guy and through his years in entertainment as your self is known to be a great man.    I only hope in the future you both will be friends again. I wish I could tell you how to fix this and what to do or say that would help you accomplish this. However, I’m just a mere mortal and unfortunately not a wizard on wisdom. I do however feel as humans we are highly intelligent to do great things. No one’s perfect and with all the great highs, we have all traveled through some rough lows to get there. However, you have made a start on the walk of remorse and healing. You’ve extended the olive branch and I hope he see’s this and feels your sincerities. If not know you tried and except it and move forward, lesson learned.   I wish you the very best, your both freaking icons in my book.  🏆💙
Insincere bullshit damage control.  If Chris isn’t willing to accept your apology, why should we?
You owned Chris an Apology the following day, not 90 days later.
Hollywood. Where the bs is so thick you can build a house on it.   I for one am done with Will.  Bye bye
This video was the right move. We all are called to love each other and I deeply hope that chris and his family accept your apologies.   Learn and grow... that's life.  Love you will!
We all make mistakes. There is no reason you should be held to a higher standard than any other human being. On top of that, being in the media, you're having to relive a mistake over and over again. You deserve grace and acceptance.
Will, we all make mistakes; don’t be too hard on yourself. We still love you and I will be praying that the Lord will heal you and help you through this.
Oh I commend you for apologizing it's been way more than a minute. I have always admired you and seen every movie you're ever in but it will be a minute before I'm able to do that again. At least you finally got the balls to do this.
Thank you.
You are forgiven
Well said. Everyone makes mistakes. It wasn’t pretty but it’s good to see someone own up to their mistakes like you did.
On the advice from his lawyers
I just want to be able to listen to Wild Wild West again.
I still…. Love me some Will..!!!! And I’m not sorry..!🥰🥰
😎💥💣💯✌🏾      🍿🍿🍿     Next time...PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE OR BIGGER !!!
I understand why he’s apologizing but, he technically did nothing wrong. If you ain’t from the streets, you probably wouldn’t understand.
you have nothing to apologize for!
You’re a good man, Will, and this is a heartfelt and contritious apology which should serve to help repair the psychological damage this unfortunate lapse of reason has caused. However due to how much you mean to so many people and how obvious it is that you are a caring soul, you will recover fully from this before long and go on to do yet more good in the world with your unrivalled creative legacy.
We miss you 💙💫
But you should be ashamed, for sure.
I've watched this 3 times. I'm sure I'm not the only one and after only 1 hour this vid has more likes than views. I cried the 3rd time when he mentioned disappointing people is his central trauma. I understand, but feel bad at the same time. So glad he's doing the work and amazing things will come from this. One day he'll love back and say this needed to happen.   I hope all parties are healing, especially Chris. Maybe one day they'll collab on something major, something life-changing. Prayers for all🙏🏾❤️
Thanks for uploading this video Will, but I'll be unsubscribing now. Very disappointed. SMH.
My respect has grown for will. That’s the first step, saying that u apologize and u get that it was wrong, NOW, let’s take action and u prove not to us but to yourself that u are not a shitty person and that u are sorry. People make mistakes, but u learn from them. Shrug that bs off and get back to what makes u happy. Praying for u big guy.
Good luck Mr. Smith
There’s no man walking this earths surface that’s perfect. Take any 1 of the numerous mistakes we’ve made then imagine them been broadcast around the GLOBE now also ask yourself regardless of your situation how much positivity you’ve put into this world or how much have you done for charity’s and for 90% of us it’s not a fraction as what will smiths done. Remember may he without sin cast the first stone.
You dont have to be ashamed of yourself  at all... just invite him to the crib and yall have a 1 on 1 fight and after the fight yall 🤝🏽 and pop a bottle 🍾🥂 its all love at the end of the day. WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES!!
I know it’s been ruff for you because when humans make a mistake the hardest part for a human to say is I’m sorry and I forgive you
look up andrew tate message for will smith
I don't know.... seems staged and forced. I'd rather this come randomly without a crowd of people standing behind flood lights and a production.
Well done! This was healing. Well done.
Forgiven is so important!  You’re doing the right thing. Now it’s up to the people you hurt to accept your apology and forgive. Been praying for you. 🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️
👍❤👍
You are still the Fresh Prince. Be well Philly.🙏🏽
Apologize to the man....no media....sincere...then move on....you can do it will....
Thanks Will.. I except your apology.. I have followed you since , "Fresh Prince " and  will continue! ✌️💜
I'm really glad to have seen/listened to this.  It's far too late, but good to hear regardless.  Unfortunately, I've lost all respect for you (not that you care). But, thank you Will.
Thank you tremendously for being transparent ❣️ ❣️ We hear you but  most importantly we SEE you dear heart❣️❣️
Been one of my role models my whole life mistakes happen atleast you own up a lot of people never even do that
Goodluck will. Hope get through it all. ❤️💕
bit late
We all have those moments Will. Keep strong and in control. You'll always be golden, man x  (from UK)
You went on a 3 month hiatus after em brassing the man on live TV and let him deal with the heat. No excuse scorpio moon , we know you fucked up
Real stuff Will, strong apology it’s funny how little most people care about celebrities and their issues.
we love you will. we got you!!!
Everybody hates Chris 😂
You're the legend, man. Don't let anyone say otherwise.
Love you Will Smith ❤️
It takes courage to reach inside and admit you're wrong. People make mistakes, we're all human.
We love you past your mistake. You are an example of doing the work and we all can take a page out of your book ❤❤
“Trying to be remorseful without being ashamed” was a truly powerful statement. I’ve been there.
I'm sure Chris forgives him in his heart, but as the friends they were that feeling of betrayal and public humiliation must have been a hard pill to swallow. The pill of disappointment seems so big to digest at times.  Pray for healing for you BOTH ❤️
You are missed! You are loved! You are HUMAN! So happy you're back! Keep shining your light! ✨️  P.S If you haven't already, please read his book!
It takes a lot of courage to admit fault and in today's society of showing perfection only. It's not my place to forgive or condemn you.  I ask you to share the journey with us more. This is a momentus opportunity to share our imperfections, our mistakes, and our experiences. I see this as an opportunity to open a dialogue on mental health    and to change the way we look at it. Together we are strong and can build a community based on compassion, empathy and forgiveness. The world is so angry these days. I am here for Mr. Smith. Let us walk the journey together and help each other heal.
この問題が、無事に解決することを心から願っています。
already forgot this happened.
Your true fans will never turn their backs on you. You've done nothing but giving us all laughter, great content, etc over the years.   We all have our moments. Real people understand that. Not this generic bullshit we are seeing in today's world.
Bro, it's called adrenal fatigue. You need some time in monk-mode.
Tell the truth.  ...  it was a ritual that you performed it was all planned out
There’s not one negative comment. Makes me think they’re being deleted. Obvi a pr move but hopefully it’s sincere
Great respect for you Will. You are human, you are allowed to  make mistakes. May Chris find it in his heart to forgive you. God has forgiven you. God bless!
Will your always a good man but it’s alright everyone makes mistakes but you can from them or learn from those mistakes
Yeah Will you have become a very good actor I almost believe you. Anyway your next movie's gonna be that test.
I respect Will for this truly. But even still Chris deserved it. End of.
Thank you for your honesty Will.  We are all human and we make mistakes.  Much peace to you and your family.
God bless you I pray you&Chris will sit as grown men,children of God and hug it out y'all are black kings walk in it even though the world seen it y'all can still move forward without looking back... everybody have a blessed day and weekend.... deliverance is need ,shake the devil off you're stronger than that will ...
We love you Will. You’re human just like the rest of us.
He should have been dressed in a clown outfit and honked a horn after every sentence.
Will Smith...you ARE and will ALWAYS be my favorite actor. I'm in the midst of reading your book slowly to understand you. And I do.. get you!!  You've apologized to Chris, his family and to the world for your inappropriate actions. It's time to forgive yourself and move on as difficult as that may be. Your true supporters and fans such as myself understand you and love you come what may. I can hear and feel the hurt in your voice because you are that guy that doesn't want to disappoint people. Well you did in that moment. But you did what any upstanding individual knew he had to do and that was to apologize. I commend you and God indeed loves you the most❤️❤️❤️
Will and Chris we got you!
I WISH this had a love button because “liking” this is not enough for me. I have been in this space before and felt exactly what you felt. Thank you for your transparency, vulnerability and authenticity. These attributes are way more valuable than anything you have given your fans over the years. Keep healing, it looks good on you! 💕
I could do without the giant ad for your book just below the video description but you’re a real man for making this video. Feels refreshing to hear celebrities be this vulnerable and human.
Will, you have always been my favourite artiste after Denzel Washington (apologies, please I am not calling you a second fiddle.....someone must just be #1. And you are #2 of my 45 favourite artistes/actors).....and you will not cease to be in my heart as someone I love. Your action on that stage shook me and caught me unprepared, I was briefly mad at you and was expecting an apology before the event comes to an end. But then, I realize you are human and not a saint. You can't be perfect as to err is human.  I am so happy you are admitting your faults and absolutely sorry for your actions. I hope Chris reaches out to you sooner and repairs this threatened bridge of friendship between you guys.  For you, Chris, be closer to God (in any way you serve Him). Devil knows your present and future is full of light and joy and wants it terminated....do not let him have control over you. Seize that demon and cage it, you know what I mean.   I wish you the best in whatever situation you are going through from them till now.  A fan from Nigeria.
I still need some time, because it wasn't just Chris you hurt and disappointed on that stage at one of the biggest events in this country. As someone who grew up watching and supporting your work, it still hurts, alot 😢 and you don't even know me.
🤝🏿
Its understandable Will, great attitude on apologize to Chris's Mother, congrats!
I wrote out a long comment and then deleted it. In the end, famous people do whatever they feel is right. Good luck to you both
We never stopped to be friends Will!! 😁👍🏼
"I was fogged out by that point"..... hmmm.... but he wasn't too "fogged out" to go to the after parties and dance around and have fun right? What a BS artist! He had plenty of chances to apologize for what he did and he's only doing this video now to start the process of getting back his career.
He is human and he made a mistake. It was never his plan, it happened, we can't turn back the hands of time and we just need to move forward. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
You didn't apologize at any point that night because you were too affected by your emotions? I don't buy that for one second. You were dancing and partying shortly after.
nah, dont care , you just showed your real yourself that night
Well done Will. You've always been an inspiration to me and continue to be. No one's perfect. We all react in ways which we regret afterwards.All the best. From Cape Town.
Too little too late
READ THIS: you have brought so much joy and distraction to so many lives. I don't make a habit of commenting on much of anything especially celebrities videos.  You have given so much happiness in 30+ years in your industry and have never stepped a foot out of line. We all make mistakes, yours a just amplified, I have the privilege of making mine in private. We all make mistakes, don't let negative comments or articles stop you from bringing joy to yourselves and others, now get out there and make BB4. Keep running and reading
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK KING!!! YOU OWE NO ONE ANYTHING!!!
I love you Will Smith 🙏🏾 I’m praying for you 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 keep praying keep healing ❤️‍🩹 remember you are a giant 💜I felt this 📌🗣
You dont mean it
❤❤❤❤🥀🥀🥀🥀
Will I’ve always been a fan of yours and will continue to be. We all have done thing that we regret later on. It’s how you rebound from those mistakes. This if you allow it will make you better for it. Continue to embrace love. God allows us to go through things so that we recognize that we need to look to him and come out better on the other side. Stay strong my brother.
why this dude even famous LMAO
You are a great actor and a greate person with a warm heart ❤️
It's ok Will I understand how u felt at that time now it's time to get back to work and start making good art and put this in the past move on, I bit Chris won't say nothing else..
This video is about to do bonkers numbers
Uncle that’s a wise move for doing this video. We love you uncle . Watching from GHANA, west Africa
We love you, Will. You are what a real role model looks like. Thank you for taking the time to work on you quietly and come back a better person for us.
In the heat of the moment, I lost my head; lost my mind... All you can do is apologize and go forward knowing you've learned from the experience. It is clear that you are a good person who did a bad thing. Glad to know that you recognize and want to do better. Stay strong! The devil is real and WE never want to let him win.
Yes took 4 months and a trip to India to apologise. Get out of here dude.
If any one can make a comeback , it’s Will Smith
Chris is not ready to talk, because he doesn't want this to end because he is reaping some benefits from it. He deserved it
I believe he is sorry. He can give back to the world in his own way and we can get on with our lives.
At this point, will should just go lowkey and live his life outside media eyes. There are no apologies that will restore his image. Just disappear and move on
seems sincere but he is a great actor so.....  jk this was stand up on his part..glad he did this..we are all human..once chris forgives him then we all can
i hope chris sue you soooo bad that you end up broke and back in West Philadelphia, where you was born and raised
Fixaaaaa😟
Lmaoo my man slow off the meds
"If you hold on, we can be friends again"   translation for those of you that actually think Will Smith is in any way your friend:    "if you get over this, you can pay to see my movies again"
We are with you lets go
Will, not sure if you will read this personally. However I hope this will encourage you.. This took great courage. May God bless you and give you strength to also forgive yourself.
Well... You didn't snap for a second. You stayed all night even when you were told to leave several times. And your son Tweeted that this is what you do in your family...
Good to see you back Will!
He still protecting this woman...smh..salute to you Will. Still the 🐐 in my eyes.
Will Continue to be great words from streetlyfe WE ALL STILL LOVE YOU MANE ...
Glad your back...
I appreciate you for apologizing Will. I gained respect for you we all make mistakes. Thank you 🙏🏾
Well, you are apologizing and most people don't apologize (EX: Ezra Miller owes the public about 40 apology videos by now and Ezra won't apologize for any of the illegal crap they did). You are doing more than most do, so I'll give you one thumbs up. I'll consider giving  you the second thumbs up if you continue to do good. Don't be "bad guy" Will, be "good guy" Will. "Good guy" Will is so much better than "bad guy" Will.  Be a good guy. 🙂
Another PR stunt!
Please do not allow this to be a breaking point for you. We have to use every situation and experience to take us to the next level. It happened so it was part of your journey, now you have said your peace. The lesson in here may be Chris, your fans, and your constituents ability to forgive!! Sometimes God uses our flaws and behaviors to challenge others faith, forgiveness, and growth. You’re doing all that be peaceful with your journey and I hope to see you doing greater things! Let this allow you and people of your statue create other avenues for our accolades!!!! We should be rewarding us!!!!! Peace and Love Greatness!!!
Will get help with ur mental health being with a toxic women isnt good for u now or ever
Thank you so much Mr. Smith for your words...I need you to know that I have great respect for you that has not waned...I pray for you In your journey of healing your mental and physical health.  And look forward to your comeback. I know it will be awesome. I Love you and support you  God Bless 🙏🏾❤️
Will you're cool with me bro. Mistakes are made.
Everyone make mistakes.Its human nature and you did apologise  I think you are an amazing artist and amazing person man. We all love you❤️
This my dad right here y'all. 100.
😍Hats off to you Will, that takes courage 🥰
Everybody makes mistakes Will. No one is perfect and in time this situation will sort itself out
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but you always learn. And you have learned and we have all learned from all this as well.
I still respect you and hope you get as much help as needed and that you find peace someday. We all make mistakes and hopefully learn from them. Take as much time as necessary to heal up your mind! 💪🏿💪🏿
there’s not one person on this planet that hasn’t made a mistake. your apology seems genuine so I hope you and Chris can make amends…
Can't wait to see all the YT therapists break down this apology video lol
I hate you’re being put through this. None of us are perfect. We’ve all had unbecoming moments just not shot live. Keep your head up and as long as you made amends with Chris or did your end to extend your apologies I have no words because im not the judge. God is!
There is no love lost here. I have supported you since I was a kid and will continue to support you. Praying and wishing you the best during this time of healing.🤗🥰🧡
It rewind time
We never stoped Loving you Will.♥️♥️
Looks like he’s being held hostage
The man has apologized.  End of story.  Let’s forgive and move on.
There is a limit to how many apologizes a person can say before you have to all move on .
shout outs to Will for being human in a world that expects you to be something else... it shows that you are real. real is relatable. 🖤
Thats the right thing to do. Good for you Will and for all.
Praying for you , brother 🙏🏽💪🏽
Emotional Intelligence dictates; We are not what we’ve done ❣️ ❣️We truly see you (the whole being) and we Love you brother ❣️❣️ Be encouraged knowing that you may not win them ALL but that ONE is worth seeing yourself rise again❣️❣️Through our trials, tribulations and life experiences, we provide HOPE for someone else navigating through their own guilt and shame from less desirable choices as we live this thing called LIFE❣️❣️ Don’t allow your own Shadows of Guilt and Shame to Hide/Dim  your Light from the World ❣️❣️ You are still a Great Hero to Many Brother ❣️ You Matter to Us❣️❣️Don’t you let nothing or no one make you forget that❣️❣️ You are still here for a purpose ❣️❣️ Sending Loving Energy your way brother in Hopes 2 Love your Light Back 2Life❣️❣️ Shine Brightest through your Authenticity ❣️❣️
Takes a man to admit when your wrong 🥂
Sometimes we react faster than our thoughts. Small mistake, Chris wasn’t injured.   Fist fights use to “solve” a lot of tension when we were kids. Not saying that is a indefinite solution. But sometimes we let it out.  It takes tougher people to forgive, let’s hope all can forgive and we can move along 👊🏼
Gentle reminder to all that Will is an actor. Do as you wish with this info.
You’re an honourable soul for trying to address this with the utmost respect for everyone! You made a mistake and we have all done things we aren’t proud of. It’s unfortunate you live such a public life and your mistake happened to come at a very public time, but you are taking steps in the right direction to correct your wrongs. Will you will always be an inspiration to me and this just shows me how human you are! ❤️
We all go through stuff in life. We make mistakes. Respect
Just get over it. You made a mistake, happens to everybody. You are not god, just a human. Nobody expects you to be perfect, people talk about you because you are famous and everybody loves to gossip. get over it.
Love you will ❤
Everything will heal in time; Lord Bless you and your family!
Love you always.  It's easy to love when everything is good but when you mess up or disappoint that's when you need unconditional love.   Stay strong and keep healing ❤
Is this Will Smith or the kid Mero?
Damn it took you this long to realize it
Why did this take three months?!?!  Sorry, that’s too long, man…  You could have made this video instead of your tweet/IG post the next day, or even a few days later while everyone was talking about it. Better late than never… but… three months?!?! 👎🏻
We still friends Will! I don’t let my friends go if they make a mistake. There is no greater love than to give one’s life for a friend. To let you go at your time of need is not a friend. They are those who benefited from your greatness.  I learned what love is from your video and then began to study Thich Nhat Hanh’s Four Elements of Love. You, my friend, are pure love and I will never let you go.
Instead of being angry; i actually cried, because that was truly sad and hurtful.  I will say this; the people who got up and try to "console" you, honestly didn't do you any favors. If you had someone on your side that night, then the whole thing would have ended right there and then.   That was sad and it hurt that you would do that to that particular man. It took away from everyone's moment and from your moment and the hard work you put in and that was really really sad.   I think most people have had moments like this, not on the scale but I've done and said things that hurt others. It's going to be ok. You will all get there.
I respect that this video isn't monetized.
Still look up to this man and for this video now more than ever ❤ love you Will. Take care 💐
Shame on you been a long time fan lost all my respect for you that day
You go man. I see nothing wrong with this video. Nobody can see the amount of dislikes but I would hope its not very many at all. I give you a ton of respect to talk about this mistake out loud. I'm sure some people probably would have liked to see  this months ago but these things take time.
It’s great to see you take accountability for that mistake. You’ve clearly healed from that incident . Now you can move on with your life Will. You , such a great actor and funny comedian. We all do silly thing in life . However, we should never be defined by it.
Welcome back Will. We all make mistakes.
🐱 will have you outta your mind
Thank you Will. It takes a good man to apologize. Keep getting jiggy with it!
I believe you. You're right... You're human. To err is human, to forgive divine. I'm so glad that you've taken time to process this whole thing.  Continue to take your time to finish processing and forgiving yourself.
Will I expect ur apology now I can watch ur movie again I was waiting for you to say something but u did now I’m good with u I really forgive you now my kids can watch ur movie
Well done Will you made a start. Its understandable Chris is not ready yet. He will when he's ready.
Forgiveness is the highest form of Healing. Will Smith must forgive and heal himself and then all necessary healing will in place. This is the year of Healing if you want to heal. 2022 =6. According to Numerology. It is also the year of Taurus and Libra..
Understandable, have a good live!.
All I have to say is we all make mistakes. I'm for one had say stupid things in the heat of the moment and make people cry or hurt their feelings more than once. I'm not by any means proud of it and each time I apologized and fixed things, I think. With that said, they're both grown up man. I'll say sit down and talk it over in private and turn the page. I think Will is genuinely in this video. I also was very upset and refused to watch anything with him on. But now I'm cool with him. We need to forgive in order to be forgiven by others.
Idc I love Will Smith soo much!! This is the first incident that I know of in his entire career. He was wrong but people took it too far. He is holding himself accountable, accepting responsibility, and I’m looking forward to all of his upcoming projects!!
2022 is wild. We got a YouTube apology video from Will Smith
He had to be on something. Probably psychiatric prescription drugs plus recreational weed. Tom Cruise was right.  I bet he's still on the psychiatric prescription drugs the way he wants ppl to feel sorry for him for having guilt and feeling like a pos.  Had he come out and said his mind wasn't right because of the psychiatric prescription drugs and recreational weed he might have been on, he'd be excused a lot easier.
It’s easy to make mistakes, but it’s even harder to admit when we have messed up. I am so touched by your vulnerability to do the right thing!!
❤
“Alright guys, I need at least three dramatic camera angles to sell this apology. Make sure to get my good side”
this is about to me a great meme
Anyone else find this really dull & pointless?!
What a crazy ride of emotions. 🏍🏁
Doing the work! We used to say, "that's what a man does" but now I'll say, "that's what an adult does"! You're showing, even when you're down, that you're someone worthy of admiration. Thank you for your vulnerability and humility, brother.
To people asking why is he reaching out now, He was here in India in Iskon foundation. Its kinda like a meditation / rehabilitation center. He gave all these months to heal himself 😊
Thank you for your honesty! You are still very much loved. I wish you the best of luck in getting past this.
Love you brother!
Good to see this vedio after what happened you really dropped from our eyes but it takes a lot to admit what you did was horrible 👏
This takes actually strength to do. So proud of Will for doing this. Keep doing good Will!
We are only human. You have my respect. It only goes up from here, Will!
I'm I'm rooting for you Will you'll get through this. 💞
Missed you Will!!!  Your strong 💪🏽 and human.  Stay humble.  Jehovah any is possible
Nobody is perfect. People have bounced back from doing worse things then this situation. Chris will eventually forgive you. Give it time.
Please just get out of Hollyweird! It has sucked your soul dry and we all know you're better than that!!!! Please run, don't walk!!!  Hollyweird will change you; I'm sure you've seen it happen to others.
Respect <3 !
How is this dude gonna come on camera 5 months later and say Jada's look had nothing to do with this
Sure he’s an actor but the pain in his eyes at the end seems very genuine. Continue to reflect and be you, we’re here when you’re ready. 🙏
this is proving my point why i love will.
He is man enough to apologize. He admits his error. I think the debt is paid in full. Move on.
HEY HEY HEY..... SO GLAD TO SEE YOU!!! GOD GOT YOU BOTH. Out of your whole career this is the first time you have done something like this.  We all know something was wrong. And it was raw that night running deep. So if it wasn't Chris, it was going to be unleashed on someone. Spiritual indeed. We not canceling.  We waiting on a movie. LOL. We all will keep praying for you. We see God have been giving you your whippings and aligning you to love. Just receive correction and love and keep it moving.
Thank you for apologizing and owning your truth in situation that unfolded, mistakes happen but being able to admit you were wrong is such a big step towards forgiveness for yourself and hopefully for Chris 🤍 thank will smith for being you and always being honest
Will, I was mad but we’re good now.
I love you WILL AND THANK YOU FOR BEING A SUCH AN AMAZING ROLE MODEL ITS THE PICTURE IN THE BACK The world 🌎 is sick and ❤️ LOVE IS The CURE 💐💐💐💐
This is going to be trending
I actually respect this video 1000 times more than those videos people put out immediately with those crocodile tears and apologies just to quell the woke mob and to save their online reputations. This man took the time to get some help, to contemplate.
so whens the next movie
The only way to settle this is to let Chris get his lick back on TV👏🏼🥴
I love how they plugged Jaden's water the the background! You don't owe the world anything.  Like you said. When Chris is ready he will call.
Brrruhhhh
We all make mistakes.  You're a human being. I have always been a fan of yours and I always will be. Takes courage to admit your wrong. We love you Mr. Smith. Can't wait  to see come back better than ever. The come back is always greater the setback.
Português Will, you have my respect, man! Apologizing is the best and most sensitive thing anyone could do, not everyone has the guts to do that! You are awesome! I wish you the best! Here in Brazil we all love you! Don't let anything get you down, it's time to get up, we're all here to lend you a helping hand.
Will it will pass; you are a hero in many peoples eyes. All hero’s have their faults and slip ups. Apart of being human. We love you will and you will always be remembered for your courageous moments not your faults.
What he did was shitty, he's apologized and seems remorseful. Will is not exempt from doing f'd up things. That's a human condition. All we can do is try to clean up our messes and make better choices going forward.
Turn your unnecessary evil moment into something good. Make a donation to a mental health organization.
NEXT✌🏻
He's losing money thats why he's saying sorry
It was poor judgment but you are still loved Will! At this point all you can do is give him time.   P.S.  I still want to see you in I am Legend 2.
wdgaf
I never clicked on a video so fast💨
💪🏾💯
Nobody’s perfect, and I don’t think people should condemn you & disregard your entire career over an impulsive reaction. I can see that you’re clearly sorry & I hope others can see it too, ESPECIALLY the hypocrites who still support people who have done WAY WORSE in the this industry. Sending love & light to you
look at will smith man, so inspirational.
We all make mistakes.
We forgive you Will...
Good for you man and good for the commits that's support your sorry because if people can't forgive it's unfortunate because life longer than one moment.
I'm so proud of you Will. You've always been my favorite and will forever be. I pray for your speedy healing recovery and I pray that you find peace within your journey to healing. God bless you!
Big Will! Welcome Back!!
You still a legend no matter what Will
We appreciate this but it to me was not necessary.  You are human first celebrity second. Do people make mistakes? Hell yeah . Do people have breaking point ? Sure do. I'm happy you are taking the time to reflect on your life. Only thing you can control is what happens next. Stop trying to please everyone . No matter how good you are you will always be the villain in somebody's story and that ok. I couldn't imagine being everyone's golden child. It must carry alot of weight.  We live and we learn.  Just try to mend your broken bridges and learn how to take care of self first. People pleasing will mentally and physically drain you. #givejesusthewheel ❤
i love you will smith, it takes a real man to admit & own up to his faults. respect 💯
🤡
Without Forgiveness Where Would We All Be...Without Lessons Of This Magnitude Where Would We Be... Much Love Will.
You can start by tying up those shoe laces first tho.
Whaa whaa whaa, privelage black man tries to save himself, with another apology video. We know who you are now. A scumbag. You related to smolette?
Sometimes it is. We do so many good things, but just make a mistake and all our work is discredited. But that's only in the eyes of stupid people.  Thank you for bringing much more light to the world than darkness. This episode made you grow as a person and this video in particular made you a giant.  We love you Willard.  Sorry for the grammar mistakes, I'm using google translator. Greetings from Brazil.
Too little too late
We love you and forgive you, Will.
HE GOTTA CATCH THESE HANDS!
We mess up…. Things happen… Don’t be so hard on yourself, the world is being hard enough on you. God created you. Not us. Not them. Not the Sorry dried up academy. You are apologetic. Yet you are human.  You aren’t Hancock in real life. You are an imperfect man. Chris will call, you’ll talk. And life will go on. I Hate how everyone thinks they’re God and their opinion matters sooo much. It doesn’t. Anticipate joy and nothing else. ✌🏽
Im proud of you Will. Nobody perfect in this world. We’ve all made minor/major mistakes. And we’re afraid what people think of us after that. You’re still one of my favorite actors. I only wish you the best
🙄
Take it easy sh*t happens everybody snaps sometimes especially when you're famous naturally people are gonna charge at you.
Imagine being in the industry for 3 decades, being an example to others, Making classic movies and shows, and for a horrible moment, get shunned out.  Chris deserved none of what Will did, but I’m not rolling with getting projects pulled and 10 year ban. Will has carried networks and directors to bags. Wish all parties the best.
Did you just ask yourself questions and then answer them? lol
This was great…genuine. Except he’s still not addressing the REAL problem which he attempts to mitigate because he’s such a loyal guy. I get it and too bad…sad to watch him not break free and be himself again.
We made it will. Focus
Why just now? Hope you realized it sooner or it was just your ego who controls you. I liked this man before but not anymore.
*WE LOVE YOU WILL, MUCH RESPECT* 🩹💜🙌🏽🤌🏾🙏🏽
We all make mistakes and we all have breaking point, even the best of us. Just from looking on the outside and there are a lot of problems inside Will Smith home and you can see the emotional burden it has taken on him and his lashing out at Chris was a result of that, in my personal opinion. I love Will Smith and I hope the counsel he is receiving is a Godly, Biblical counsel, if not I hope somebody gets him the gospel soon so he can experience true healing and repentance that will lead to joy!
Healing takes time .
Will, why are you reaching out now? Your PR image has already has taken a turn for the worst by the wait. Its insane how up on your high horse you and your people were after that moment.
Naw nigga, I don’t feel bad for you my boi
So many of us love you both that it's been sad from this end but I know you've got more going on in your private life than we will probably ever know so I really hope things get resolved and Chris is able to forgive you because I just thought straight to his childhood (Everybody Hates Chris) and how cold that must have felt to him up there. x
We're all human, we all make mistakes...I'm still of fan of Will Smith. We all go through personal struggle, personal anger or personal mistakes and in our own ways or with others we have ways to pick ourselves up out of it. Gotta still believe in the heroes who have moments of failure.
You've handled yourself well for 30 plus years, despite the pressures of being "Will Smith". Everyone has a bad moment. This will not define you. Time to move on. Ignore the haters. We still respect you.
We ALL say/do/think stupid things.  The prior act does not need to be a career or life defining moment.  The apology may be and I commend you for taking the time to do so.
5:05 you're not a piece of sh*t, you're a legend man and a human too.  So don't think about it too much. You have apologized and thats enough there is nothing you can do about it now.
We're all human, just admit to your mistake, apologize to chris, and make amends.
How to take your bad actions and make it about yourself 101
This was sincere.. he’s correct, we all are human and some have made worse mistakes n had to own them. The first step to healing is acknowledging. Thank you Will!
Apology Accepted.. we love you!.
Chris doesn't deserve an apology. He's too busy milking the situation to stay relevant.  We still love you, Will.
No one's perfect, everyone makes mistakes, you've apologized and everyone should move on. My family and I still love Will Smith and will continue to support your craft.
People get smacked everyday B lol
It’s good to see you back. I applaud you for taking accountability for your actions. We love you!
Forever with you brother ♥️ I wish Chris forgive you....
Felt like he's been gone for a long time. Missed seeing him. Can't wait to see him on the big screen again
I commend you, Will! Still a huge fan.
This man will forever be a hero in my eyes.
I dunno. This is coming a couple weeks after they announced they are moving forward with Bad Boys 4. Feels a little like a "well before we do the movie, you need to get back on people's good side" move. Hopefully I'm wrong but this feels like it's 3 months too late 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Respect or putting this out there - takes a lot of courage to acknowledge a mistake publicly and own up to it
The subtle shade given out by Sir Anthony Hopkins was glorious.
you a outstanding man , always been my role model . take care brother 👊
Believe me, I know what it's like to regret one moment for the rest of your life. But we can learn from our failures for healing and understanding. That moment could be used as a lesson for all of us, that we are still evolving and growing as human beings. And when we experience the desire for vengeance, that we can always choose understanding and forgiveness.
Support for both men and families. The message is appreciated. ❤️
We all make mistakes, THE BEST🔥
Kinda late bro
Nice Will, really nice ❤️
Proud of you for doing this!! Everyone makes mistakes! I hope you and Chris sit down and show the world progress can be made! Still rocking with you!! 🙏🏽
Personally I would've forgive him
One action doesn’t make a man.  Just sucks it was on live TV. Lol.  I’m sure you will do the work you need to do and people will see that and forgive.
Embarrassing
Hold your head high Will. I Love you! ♥️
I can respect this. The only thing is you didn't have to publicly put the ball in Chris's court like that. But I do respect a public apology for a public action. Hope the best for your peace and your future. Love you Will
Just simple we make mistakes, this stuff is way overblown 🤦🏾‍♂️. The way it was drug out was just dumb to me…all the judging from perfect people, who are we???
Always loved your work my whole life
I see the PR machine is in full flow. Took them a while to come up with this format.
You called yourself a “Protector of Family” in your acceptance speech. You had ZERO regrets in that moment. This is just to save your face. Not buying a single word
I just wanna say I appreciate this n accountability is part of growth…if ur reading this nothing but God blessings upon you 🙌🏽
He's a good actor.   Might get nominated for this apology alone
We love you Will!! You're human, it was a mistake, we are still friends 🙂
Great guy. Great star. Keep wowing us with your great movies.
Keep it fresh you good homie
Regardless of what he says this incident will always be the first thing that comes to mind when his name is spoken. This incident overshawed anything positive he's has ever accomplish or will ever accomplish in his career. Sad but true.
Will…you’re the real deal! Who cares what everyone is going to say about this apology. Those same people have done stupid things in theirs lives as well, they just don’t have a million eyes watch them.
You messed up and messed up big lol but respect for your apology. One bad moment can’t take away from a lifetime of good moments, hold your head up my guy
You still a huge icon even if the media clowns you we still respect you
to little to late...
I was disappointed, you could have found a better way to handle it with Chris.
It was not the right way, but it was understandable.
We Love You Man..........It was a Short Phase of Life.......It'll Pass......Cant Wait To See Your Future Work .
that's the problem...he should be ashamed
You are still a good man. We unfortunately got to see you on one of your worst days as well as your best.
Now back to work bro, bad boys 4
Ok Will, I accept your apology. But I have to see what Chris will say for me to look over this.
Salute!!! Team Will…when accountability meets humbled!!!!
Eh. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Will, I got your heart right away. It's sad that people wíll watch this video and still have negative stuff to say like they are perfect and ALWAYS do the right thing.  Will is an imperfect person trying to do the best that he can, just like the rest of us. He is HUMAN and he made a mistake. So please give him some grace to make a mistake and take his time to do and to be better!! The fact that he was willing and able to except responsible for his actions and it's impact just shows you the true character of this man and he is phenomenal in my book 🙏 ❤.   Will your 1st mistake was the false sense of perfection that you've been trying to display and then live upto for decades. Perfection is unattainable because it is an illusion and it does not truly exist other then in our minds. Will, just know that you are good enough just the way you are, and that is more then enough!!❤❤❤
Never mind.   It's done don't do it again.
Self-control is the ability to regulate and alter your responses in order to avoid undesirable behaviors, increase desirable ones, and achieve long-term goals. Research has shown that possessing self-control can be important for health and well-being.  -impulse control -emotional control -movement control.  Will should promote self-control skills.
We love and missed you will!!!
Keep your head up, King.
Love you Will!!!!!!!💗  You are awesome.
Yo Will. I’m at the crib right now in Overbrook. Just watched the video and in no way would I ever condone your actions on that infamous night. What I really wanted to say my brother was that as a long time fan, I will continue to love and support the work you’re doing! Continue to heal and learn from your actions. We are human. As a fan, I forgive you man. Most importantly thanks for humbling yourself and keeping it real with your fans. We Love you man!! Continued success!!
3500th person too watch this in the World!! I’ve never felt like this before! Yay!
That was a good video, you're a good man
everybody makes mistakes its okay ^_^
We love you.
1 mistake doesn't erase all the good you've done. You're human. Apologize, move on.
A day late and a dollar short
I have forgiven you!
Thanks, Will!
Few things are "irreparable" if you are sincere, but the injured party has to be agreeable to reconciliation first and foremost.  Their feelings come first.  It would have been better if you could've recognized/acknowledged things in the moment, but better late than never.
take the L and move on Will
Will u still da 🐐💯
As mine and many mums I’m sure would say “you SHOULD be ashamed of yourself”.  That would be an appropriate  emotion for striking another person.    That said, good people can do bad things from time to time and I’ve always had the good people vibe from you.  Let’s learn a little more forgiveness in this world and all try and move forward.
Will Smith don't have to cuss in his raps to sell records.
will        don't take yourself  too seriously  its okay  things happened in the heat of the moment  and you are smart enough to do right  stuff    .  wanna see  cool will smith back
This is a disgusting.
Will, you were always an idol to me, someone i wanted to be "more like"; I've been the biggest fan for most my life... comedy is YOUR outlet as well as anyone in the comedy business, we poke fun at ourselves and each other, more so the people that we love... I rather have heard that you was drunk or on drugs... because at least at that point, i know that it wasn't something you thought was appropriate. We are still friends, i respect you for this video so much, everyone makes mistakes. just, please rethink your influences.
WILL AND CHRIS TAUGHT HUMANITY ABOUT SEARCHING IN OUR OWN DEEP WOUNDS, NO JUDGEMENTS ONLY EDUCATED LESSONS TO LEARN FROM OTHERS MISHAPS!
Hey Mr. Smith.  We are all humans.  We all make mistakes sometimes.  You might have a long road to redemption ahead of you however I wish you and everyone involved in the situation the best and hope you find an abundance of positivity and prosperity.  #hUmaNITY = humans + unity.  So I hope we can all learn to love each other and get past all the negativity and division going on in the world right now.   As Denzel Washington said in a college speech once as we succeed we need to reach back and help pull others up behind us.
Took way too long will should have done this a long time ago
Everybody is acting holier than thou. Fix your own homes before trying to fix someone else’s.
We missed you so much Will!!! Glad to have you back. Everyone makes mistakes, and we all deserve forgiveness and a second chance. Trust you'll bounce right back to being the Legend we know you are.
Man, paying bots to sell your book in the comments. 😂
One mistake doesnt define you
You ruined the peak moment of your acting career. Of course the Americans will forgive you. They like this Comeback-Kid-Stories. But you destroyed something unique, there is no fixing this.
💫💕🌟🙏🏾. We love you, never stopped. We all f$&k up sometimes, not excusable but understandable. Continue to be the STAR Spirit Being you are! 🦋💫
Who cares about some celebrity conflict when we have  people being slaughtered everyday. Do you think Putin would make a fake apology video wearing a hat with "Z" to promote his brand? No one cares, Will.
PR move
Lmao how there’s 22k likes but only 18k views ???? Or my YouTube tripping??
💕
Those words, of showing remorse with being ashamed of your mistake. That’s really powerful to me. I have a tendency to push shame on those in my life that I feel have made stupid mistakes. It’s easy to do that to children in particular. I will carry those words with me, and work hard to apply them to myself as well.  You’re right, you’re human, you fucked up.
All I'll say is, Will you make me miss the dislike button even more now.  It would've been awesome to have you on both of the all time most disliked videos on YouTube
I've loved you and everything you have ever done and this makes me love you so much more. You had a bad moment , but what a hell of a person you are. You deserve redemption and you deserve  forgiveness..
You’re an amazing person who got lost in the moment, i challenge any person not to react in the same way, or a similar way to that situation, but your a big man for apologising, if Chris etc do not except then that is their problem not yours
Will should be saying this in front of a judge at sentencing.
I still think Will was drunk at the time or at least tipsy. That’s explains the aggressive, impulsive behavior. And even helps explain the tears in his speech and the mental ‘fogginess’ he touched on in the beginning of the video
We all make mistakes, not one is perfect! Thank you for recognizing your wrong doing and apologizing, I hope that helps with the healing process. Sending prayers your way, may you all respectfully resolve the issue and grow from it. Stay strong!
Some of the hardest lessons, bring about the greatest of changes!!! Congrats Will, may your accountability continue to beget your GREATEST healing!!!
Any man can make a mistake... a real man owns it.  You fessed up. Not with a release from your publicist. Not with a slick package. But straight to us. For me, that speaks volumes about your character.  You're a penitent man now, and you’ll have to take the bumps right now. Your real fans will wait for you. Your real friends will support you. And I hope that you and Chris will find the time to heal together.   Much love, Will. ❤
Es hermoso que pidas disculpas de forma honesta, perdonarse así mismo, y aceptar el error es muy muy difícil.  Ojalá la paz que buscas llegue a ti y a todos los que se vieron afectados. Que bonito gesto  ❤️
Glad to see will smith back
One moment doesn't make you a horrible person, holding on, praying you make it to the other side  ♥
It was ight...but not for us but for his OWN SANITY he needs more time..this was still very scripted he still looks very vulnerable...I want Will to go back and get Will together...my opinion it's too soon... honestly he shouldn't talk about it publicly until AFTER Chris did because literally he was the victim in this..this was transparent but it's too soon...
Golden words, Will 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
🙌🏾
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why would you put that dang round white lamp directly behind him when he’s wearing a white hat! 😂😂
It’s not easy to truly forgive someone and it’s not easy to humbly apologize. We all make mistakes and will continue to do so throughout life. Live and hopefully learn.
We love you will it happens
Too late now 🤡
Never stopped being your friend, it's all love here 💛💫
Will Smith aka the Golden Star 💛💫
“Hatred stirs old quarrels, but love overlooks insults.”  Proverbs 10:12
IF HE WAS REALLY SORRY IT SHOULDN’T HAVE TAKEN THIS LONG TO APOLOGIZE
Palmeiras não tem mundial.
Bad look, you should've apologized earlier. I think you're only apologizing to save your career, learn to control your temper. Go seek mental help.
❤ I Very Love You Will Smith ❤
Thank you Will
Will, like you said, we're human. Everyone makes mistakes; It's normal, it's common, it's human nature to fix and better ourselves, so we can come out as a whole new person.  Even to this very day, I always find you as a wonderful man with a good heart. You're great in your movies and shows, but behind the camera, you are generous, in tune with nature and a great family man.  Through my struggles, I encountered a Japanese proverb that helped me move forward: "Nana korobi, ya oki" It means "Fall down Seven Times, Get Up Eight." In other words, no matter how many times we fall or mess up, we get back up and fix our mistakes.  I believe good things will happen, Will. I have faith that it will happen. I'll be cheering you on, Will. Peace & Love.
This is the beautiful and the flaw of being human none of us are perfect...Still riding with Will till the wheels fall off 💯
idk,i think hes too late
I Pray Your Continued Strength To Continue To Grow And Learn.   You Are Going To Be Better And Better And Better And Better as a Human Being, A Son, A Father, A Husband, A Teacher and an Artist. 🙏
We love you and are patiently waiting for your return. Take all the time you need.
#TEAMKINGWILLSMITH
👑👑👑👑❤️
Pewds should review this apology video fr. Will does seem very genuine
The internet can be very hypothetical at times.
Don't fall into a shame spiral Will.  Coming forward like this just restored your power again (as my mentor has said to me). I don't look down on you. I still respect you. You are enough for the world and for yourself.♥️
I think it’s good to come out and add your voice to an apology rather than tweet, this feels a little like trying too hard. Apologising to the academy, Chris mom, other nominees.. all you need to do is straight up meaningfully apologise to Chris.
man i just wanna see Will happy again, mans been going through tough times hey
That’s enough for me. That was a heartfelt apology. I can get past it.
A great human being, certainly better than *anyone* who has been hating or judging him this year.
Been a Will Smith fan all my life and in that moment I saw a bully not Will Smith. Personally not gonna suddenly d ride you after hearing this but we'll see and hey don't worry most people are fickle. They'll be on your side in no time.
Some people may accept this apology and that is OK by me.    For me, I would have accepted this apology better if it had come out within a few days of the original incident.      Instead, we saw his son saying ‘That’s How We Do It’ in the next day or so.     How much of this remorse is real and how much of it is an act?  I will never know for sure at this point.
Creo que necesitas invitar a Chris a charlar personalmente con vos, y hablar en profundidad sobre todo lo ocurrido.
Before I watch this I just want to commend the dope dadfit.
God Bless you sir.
Mistakes were made hopefully forgiveness can be brought to the surface and I wish you all the best
Apologies accepted. Now, retribution. How much money are you willing to give to Chris and his family and how much money are you willing to give to the community (charities) ?
This whole ordeal just shows how ridiculous the celebrity culture is. Imagine how cringe a video apology would be for your average Joe 😳 🤣
Does this tie into anger management. But if so I would encourage “Will Smith” to do some soul searching and do a brief video on that front.. At the end of the day we can say  “I simply lost it”; that’s when one should genuinely take time for a route cause analysis..    Last but not least both Chris and you are outstanding personalities and I am confident that time will bring about forgiveness and peace and love which you both deserve in a special way…
Its been 900 years... Nobody cares lets just move on
Love you !
I love you Will I wad just thinking about you the other day glad to see you 🙏🏻 Cotinue  to be great may you  stay protected  and be blessed we are not perfect
Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone doesn't own up to it like you have. We all have room to grow, learn, and change for the better. Keep God first and keep moving forward. 💕
This right here this how we as human being need to take responsibility of the wrong doing we do come face to face with yourself but most importantly grow your relationship with God get more closing to him leave everything in hands step by step you will see changes and peace in your life
We love you will as a human mistakes happens to all of us, its takes lots of courage to accept it 👏👏👏
W
We love you Will and I'm rocking with you!
It is time to heal. No need to drag this on. Simple solution to the world. We humans love drama and it is an addiction that affects people.
We love you Will
❤️❤️❤️
I love this man so much, I’m glad he’s doing this but it’s time to move on n make new memories good ones, it’s time I am legend 2
WHO ELSE PEEPED THE SPONSORSHIP
Forgive yourself, it was a reflex to pain that he caused at that moment!
All love man
🤣
Respect for owning your mistake. We all mess up, you just did it in the public eye, so it is magnified.
When this whole thing happened, I watched it live and it was weird.  Will isn't someone I'd expect that from and it was out of character for him.  I watched it several more times in the following days and it was just strange.  What I did was go back and reacquaint myself with Will.  The DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince albums, watching Bel Air episodes, old interviews and awards shows.  That was Will Smith, raw, before the layers of Hollywood expectations.  That's what kept me in this thing, knowing that this Will Smith is still in there.  I in no way condone what happened.  It's still like a mythical event to me.  I can't imagine what either person is feeling, or how Wanda Sykes or the other hosts felt.  Many people were affected by this.  With time it'll fade, just hopefully all involved can move on and learn from it.
Just read this quote yesterday and loved it. I'll share. "Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded. It's a relationship between equals. Only when we know our own darkness well can we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity." ---Pema Chödrön, The Places That Scare You: A Guide to Fearlessness in Difficult Times
You  had a very human moment on a very public stage. I still respect your work and look forward to seeing more great work from you. Continue to heal and know we are all reflections ....I appreciate your sharing!
We still love you Will! I hope you and Chris are finally able to get that sit down and start over.❤️
🤔🤔😴😴😴😴😴😴u lier . I saw this movie 🍿🍿🍿
You messed up in a big way Will, but in doing so you have provided an example, as usual, of how a man of character and decency conducts himself when he's done wrong.  You've come forward in the spirit of humility and openness and have demonstrated to the people that have looked up to you that they were not mistaken in doing so. We're all just human. We all make mistakes. What matters is how we do our best to try and mend what we've broken and what we learn from the experience.
Good on you man!
Sometimes we can't control our anger and that's okay, it's just one mistake Just continue being the great role model you are!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The whole situation hasn't changed my love for you! Still one of my heroes. Keep your head up!
It’s rewind time.
Thanks Will, for this. I love you and will always be a fan and a supporter from here on out!!!!❤👍🏾👑
Cool. We learn dude.  Now where's your wives apology?
Fam I forgot about that video of Tony on stage lol hilarious. Chris has other brothers but Tony to Chris is like Charlie Murphy to Eddie, he’s the less compassionate more ‘real’ one for lack of a better term, he ain’t lettin this go lol
Will, I've always liked you.  We are the same age give or take.  And I think that a lot of times you were showing the world all of the things you were able to do with your money and connections.  And oftentimes, I wondered why you didn't take me along, or someone like an everyday human who could be blessed by these experiences.  Giving light to this world is giving to others.  Not showing others what you are giving to yourself.  I hope this is received well.
In my opinion, what you did was 100% wrong and unjustified. That being said, I still respect and like you because making a mistake doesn't make you a bad human being. Owning up to your mistake makes you a good human being.
I still love you dude ur a childhood idol of mine we all do dumb stuff but it takes a big man to admit his wrong doing I admire that I feel you are sincere coming from my heart to apology so thank you
Mistakes are a constant in our lives, but learning from them is a decision, and that is what differentiates a regular person from a great human being. Keep learning.
Just remember everything you are seeing here took months to contract and had a team of people making sure this helped Will's and his families brand. We saw the real him this is a construction.
no one is perfect. Mad respect for you bro.   we all mess up. this is a great way to making things right.
tHIs viDeO iS SpONsoReD bY sKiLl ShARe
Somehow I would like to see Andrew Tate react to this video
Welcome Back
❤️
You should make amends to the people that you hurt, as long as it isn't causing more harm to those individuals.
Mr Smith - how on earth do you expect him to talk?  You embarrassed him on a GLOBAL STAGE. Not acceptable. You should have waited for Chris to accept your apology. This was simply all about you. You need better PR.
I was patiently waiting to hear from you. I was sad for you because I feel,  without even knowing you, that you have a beautiful soul and that this mistake would hurt you deeply. We are all imperfect beings and we will make mistakes.  Please try to forgive yourself.
Trump needs to apologise for January 6th to the American people. If people are unapologetic about Trump leading a coup...then we can ALL GOD DAMN forgive you Will.  You are human, we all are. Heal and make your peace with evrryone who got hurt by your actions especially Chris.
Good on you man. Learn and grow.
I am better & I will do better - hancock 😏
Will, We have and always will be friends. Real friends don't jump ship. I respect you both and I hope time heals for both families. Yes, naysayers that say you can't be friends with someone whom you never met. It is called A connection. It boggles my mind how fast people change and turn on you. I am sure you know who your real friends - fans- are on both sides by now. You can be a real friend to both and care about what happens to both families. I wish all involved the best of luck in the healing process.
Will didn’t do anything wrong tbh. They dragged the situation but love you will!
If we all was perfect we wouldn't need a savior let go and let God. You apologized now its on them .move on and forgive yourself
I don't believe any of this. I believe everything is staged for our distraction.
Criminal disgrace
You are loved, Will.  We all have wounds that trigger us  to respond in ways that we regret.  Those wounds are tender and when something touches them, we rise up and say and do things we would not normally do. Extend grace to yourself. This is a time that you can look at that wound and find healing.  You are a human being and it is ok to make mistakes.  Thank you for speaking today. We have missed you.  Be kind to yourself. We love you!
I respect this video
What he did was wrong but at the end of the day he reacted to something that went by so fast and didnt realise what was happening at the time and he has been in the film industry for 30+ years nearly 40 and has never once done anything wrong and he was seen as an inspiration to lots of people and as soon as he does one thing everybody jumps at him like he is some sort of serial killer, but honestly a man that is completely perfect shouldn't be a role model but a man that doesn't make many problems and when he does he owns up to it and admits he was wrong that is what a man should do and that I think is more inspiring than a man who is 100% all the time because we as humans are meant to make mistakes and learn from them
“We’ll be friends again.” Absolutely, Will. Also, just because something is broken or damaged doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t ever be fixed; it may not be overnight, it may take some time, but it can be done.   This was the first of many steps, I believe, towards making things right again. ✊🏾
Nobody’s perfect! God forgives us everyday when we acknowledge our mistakes!
Before media picks this up, I want you to think what if your worst moment was public? Not an embarrasing moment but the dumbest thing youve ever done? Please think about that before you judge too much. We need people like Will, as flawed and as human as he is. Please remember that. While I know he was bad for what he did, please see this as more dynamic then just "he is bad and deserves to be punished severe. "
Love for you Mr. Smith ❤❤
That's enough guys i think he has been punished all these mounths for his behavior . Stop the hate againt him he has a familly which was also hurted by all of these. He deserves to move on too as well as Chris. Who are we to not forgive him ? Before been an actor he is a human so stop the hate and the pain please.
Hey we all made mistakes in life, no one is perfect. Mr. Smith you are worth forgiving, thank you for being the better man for apologizing . You will forever be my role model. I am rooting for your career to keep flourishing! You are still loved my brother. . . ❤️
Still love ya Will!
Should’ve opened with “it’s rewind time”
Am I the only one who found this to be robotic and inauthentic. “My history with Chris”…
The thing is: Chris has to face that memory for the rest of his life. If he’s 90, sitting on a beach in Aruba, a Mai tai in his hand and he looks up at the ocean, that memory will invade that moment and say: Hey Chris! Remember this? SMACK! Sadly for Will, it’s probably the thing he’ll be remembered for.
I bet you would do it again. You're an angry person and need to seek out help. Only sorry because the incident got in the way of your career.
I don’t want to see anyone that was talking down to him trying to build him up now and show support. Y’all should have stuck with him from the beginning. Yes he deserves criticism for what he did but some of y’all didn’t couple that with consideration.
I'm not rushing to watch any of your films again however as shocking as it was, no one died. Time heals but some scars will always remain, we have to accept them as part of us.
The Slapman has returned for a bellypunch.
I forgive you Will . We all mess up man. And unfortunately some of those mistakes will be not be forgiven by others. It’s the consequences we have to face. We lack forgiveness but we lose the fact that it’s an essential part of life
All people make mistakes , Be carreful
Nuff Respect my friend
Do a movie together
Eres un verdadero PLANCHABRAGAS.
Will deserves a second chance he always seemed like a good guy and we all make big mistakes in out every day lives but we learn from our mistakes and he should be allowed to do so
This seems rehearsed and insincere.
This the most produced apology video I ever seen anyone make 😹
We forgive you brother. We love you Will. Everyone makes mistakes but it takes a man to admit to them.
This is a man. Owning up and taking responsibility - We love you Will. I hope you read this.
Nice, well thought words. Maybe too well. But im afraid its too late. You took too long. Some will see through this and some don't. No one takes literally MONTHS to apologies to someone and his family. Shame.
Well, I don't care much about all this stuff. I still like Will and continue to watch his movies, because he is a charismatic actor and his movies are fun.
I love you Will and you are still a role model for so many ppl 💓 💗 💖
Too late
Thank you so much!
Great job Will!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I was just talking about you two nights ago wondering when you would start your comeback.
Great to you see you good Brother! Keep your head up and stay on the path of positivity!
Bout time you’re back, Will! Missed you.
No one is ever void of any mistakes, we live and learn, the difference is that yours was televised on an international level. We love you will ♥️
Nah.... not buying it

I will not see any movie off him anymore!!! Sorry!!!!
It’s all love bro we trip and stumble sometimes. ❤️❤️
You should also thank Chris for not destroying you.
A very good job Chris, just keep pushing forward, you’re on the right path.
Yes we all make mistakes....please forgive yourself!!!!! If you asked God to forgive you HE has or will....now forgive yourself and continue to do the inner work for you. Love yourself and don't hate yourself! Then get back to work creating some more great movies, tv series, & music. Love from the Chi!!!!

We understand Will.... You're human. You made a mistake. You've apologized. We still love you.♥️💪🏾
Philly Pho Life
will gone be straight my mentor I look up you like a father 💯💯💯   edit  I’m not felling the fake love y’all giving him cut it tf out
Just so You know Will, I haven't given up on You (loved every moment of Your book btw) & You just gained even more respect from Me 😊 Here's praying GOD'S continued Blessings of strength & peace of mind for You 😇
We love you Will it takes a real man to acknowledge his mistakes. You reacted on impulse, you are human & you have to remember that we are all still learning no matter our age. Keep your head up King 🙏🏾
As a fellow Smith, you made a mistake bro,,just give it time, we forgive you and it doesn’t matter if some don’t
We all still love you, Will...and yes you fucked up royally,  but we all do at times.
keep your head up
Took 4 months to say this
🙏🏾❤️
I was disappointed, but cannot judge you.  Healing is slow with everyone involved.
uncle phil taught you better will
Respect for this… that’s all 👍🏾
My biggest problem with what you did was you did it to a black man, in America, in front of everyone. The pain we have endured over the centuries came back in to clear focus, again. Here is a Black Man attacking another Black Man, in front of a lot of people who wish they could do the same. I'm happy you did this video brother and I hope you, your family and Chris can get past this. All Love
Haha, I can't...Let me apologize but also promote with the W/Westbrook production cap 😂😂 The branding is strong with this one 🤣 These celebrities are something else...
My mamma counted the cans of beer I drank last night. And said miserable thoughts at the table. I deserve to drink mu beers peacefully and without guilt. They where only 4 and had a great time talking with my friend on a videocall, ended up laughing but now… I’m not happy. They are waiting, spotting your weakest point, and smashing It as soon as they can.
Its all right bro, As long as Chris forgives you, its all right
You good man, Will.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes Everybody has those days (that's right) Everybody knows what, I'm talking about Everybody gets that way (ohh!) Everybody makes mistakes (here we go) Everybody has those days (ah-ha) Everybody knows what, what I'm talking about Everybody gets that way
Will Smith real !! I don’t believe him !!! Sorry!!!
Hi Will,so glad to see you, and your right we're all human and I still love you 😘😘
It’s all Jadas fault
It takes a real man to admit his faults & to openly admit them on a public viewing platform like YouTube is immense & brave.   Ill always be a fan Will, You have come a long way & that in itself is admirable & courageous
Thanks will… 👍
IMAGINE HOW TIRED WE ARE
You made a mistake… We’re all  human…. and I pray 🙏 that we can  just move forward from here💪🏼
LOVE YOU WILL 💕
At some point in everyone's lives the pressure of day to day living, the strain of being under constant scrutiny, not getting enough rest and being tired of people talking about you and yours in a negative way creates a breaking point.  Everyone can relate to this but when we "break" it's not on a televised program reaching millions.  I'm so sorry that's when you reached yours.  Don't look back.  Look ahead. We all make mistakes, but not all of us acknowledge it.  Kudos to you and many wishes of only the best kind for you and yours.
🙏🙏
Very heartfelt and honest. Thank you, Will. Apology accepted, bro. It takes a strong man to admit his faults and shortcomings.
We can only hope Chris has heard you and is willing to meet and discuss with you about that particular unfortunate incident. However, I will say this I’m most grateful for you coming out willingly to address your wrongs, such that you pointed out specific hurt from not only viewers and the audience present at that time but also of the parents. Pick yourself up and continue being a lead character in everything that you do. Minus that unfortunate event you still are an amazing human being and continue being one.  Your SAn🇿🇦 fan here🫶
Glad to see u back will 🙏🏾
This is a good man that made a terrible mistake
Accountability 💯!
Dear will.  I love you. You funked up, your paying for it.  That's life.  Always a fan.
응원합니다 윌스미스 배우님
Yo
I'll give the sweet with the bittersweet...Will your a good actor, but you'll soon see you are no longer relevant.  You don't really care about your fan base, or you would "personally" respond to some of these comments. Nobody sane believes what you claim in this "presentation" prompted by your public relations dept.
i wish all involved the best of luck and healing, however, from someone who was bullied, this was a bully in action. you were one of my absolute favorites, maybe you will be again one day.
Congrats Will
I love Will Smith. He had a moment and an err in judgement…haven’t we all???
We all have done some stuff that we're like whew how can I get over this situation. But we do and speaking on the black community. We get made but we don't usually stay made at a mistake someone makes...we go through our junk talking and emotions and then we usually forgive the person....example talking about something like this, we don't usually hold a grudge so from me to you Will, I'm over it and can't wait to get you back for our community....keep shinning 😊
While your action shocked me, I never stopped being a fan of yours. You are taking responsibility for your action and trying to make things right. We are all human and make mistakes. You are trying to own up to it and that that’s a good first step.
I hope he never get movies job !!!
Keep my wife’s name out your fing mouth
Leave her bro
I’m of two sides to this issue. One, you’re a brother. So I can’t throw away a brother. They won’t do it, so I won’t do it. Two, you violated another brother, in front of them. Validating their twisted and wrong ideologies about us. Prove them wrong Will. That’s what I charge you with. You are one of our brightest beacons. Show them true redemption. Not just on celluloid. We need to see this more so where you and I are from (I’m from ENY Brooklyn). Be bigger and better. That’s the charge.
I never going to give other changes!!!
why didn't you get bodied by security?
Times like these I bet you wish you kept the neuraliser on you!
Poor Will, thinking its him that brought all this on his family when it's clearly all Jadas fault. This poor man has been gaslit beyond belief
Sending Lots of Love From Guatemala !!!!!!
Yeah, I wanna to not watch Will Smith videos for like 3 months, but now I think that was a bit too far perhaps.
Love you Will! I’m still riding with you! We are human beings and mistakes we make all day! You are worthy of redemption just like us all! Praying for you!!
My only gripe is that its taken so long for this .  Otherwise, love em both.
Divorce that woman, you deserve better fresh prince
Still got love for you Will and I respect you for this vulnerable moment of apology. 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
Accountability.   We all have done not so favorable things in our lives at one point or will do.  Forgiveness is yours Willard. 🥰
Congratulations on your attitude. 👏👏👏 "Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity" (Colossians 3:12-14).
Anyone that has read your book, we the fans. We understand what it was and why you stood up to protect your family. and respect you for standing up! And apologies are necessary as a man.
Will still the 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
No he apologized!!! He what jobs!!!
Shouldn’t this have been the day after? He’s rich. Doesn’t he have PR advisors? No media consultant has advised this gap…
I missed Will but I'm sti upset at how he hurt Chris.
👏👏
Perdão é um ato de Deus, espero que o Chis possa dar o perdão e você também Will
We all make mistakes, that's called being a human. It should take away from all the things you've done before that incident
It’s time for you to forgive yourself. You have permission. Just put this down now.
You've never let me down, you are human! I've loved you since the 80's and you have always represented class and grace. Feels so good to see you back ❤
I love you
Those who are WITHOUT sin, cast the first stone! I'll wait!.......🤔
I always thought they over did it with the way they judged him but I think people like seeing rich successful people lose. He's never been a bad guy
I Love You Bro and I hope to meet you one day.
“Trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself” VERY WISE 👏👏👏 An imperfect human like everyone else who made a very public mistake, is genuinely sorry and attempting to move through it in the healthiest way. I see you Will. Wishing you the best 💛
❤ its going 2b ok Will, its going to take another minute or 2....but its going 2b ok 🌞
We all make mistakes. I hope you and Chris find healing and peace from this. You're a great actor and person and still well loved. Sending love and light your way. ❤❤
You should have been arrested
I still think you're amazing...I know it's hard to feel genuinely disrespected and not know what to do in that moment.  We ALL are human and don't have time to process in a way that EVERYONE will approve of.   I'm sad to hear your voice tremble and obvious remorse.  It will get better with time.
Will you're good in my book for sure. You're human man. It takes a special kind of being to do what you just did on such a huge stage. Most of us don't face that pressure. You're amazing Will, always remember that. You're forever an inspiration to so many of us, and you will always be considered a legend, forever a hero💙
Thank you :)
So glad to see you Will. You're human and mistakes happen.  This incident doesn't define you and it doesn't negate all the good you've brought into this world! Stay strong - we're rooting for you!
My guy. Just get rid of the puppet master. She was loving every second. She will never stop until you are truly a broken man.
What you did was wrong and in the heat of the moment. You're a human being like the rest of us and we can't expect you to function or behave in the most perfect manner. Through this video you have proven that you're a gentleman. What's the greatest morale than to accept ones mistake and apologise for it? We love you as an actor. But we love you even more now as a human being.
We all mess up in life.  It’s just yours was broadcast before millions.  Everybody that has said some mean words to Will has messed up before as well.  I can forgive Will.
I always look up to you as a role model. I respect you for your transparency. I myself, accept your apology. We love you, Will Smith ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As long as you admit the mistake and apologize sincerely, that's enough and move on.
Props to Will for doing this 👍👍
Bro, we've always been friends! Since 1990 I have been admiring your career, and will not stop...These are life's learning lessons that makes us stronger and better!
I'm actually scared he may harm himself.
You made me cry.  How hard this must have been. May peace and healing come upon you both and I truly hope you guys can work through this. I hope you forgive yourself too - most important here.  Love and blessings.
Heat of the moment we all do things we are not proud of but it's you sticking up for your family i truly believe anyone in that situation would have done the same. This was a true apology. You will always be my favourite actor. I really hope we see you on the big screen again. I don't think it's worth your career. Forgive yourself many people would have done the same in your situation. We love you Will that will never change. ❤️🙏
Hello Mr Smith I never comment on anything but I wanted to let you know that you are not alone. I understand what it is like to have one moment, one decision implode your life.. it seems to wipe out all of who you are prior to the event and makes life after that much harder. We have all had these moments and I want you to know that one moment doesn’t define who we are forever it is only a snapshot of one moment.. you have always seemed to me to be an introspective person so I believe that you will learn, grow and heal from this. As a person who is still dealing with their own trauma sometimes you don’t know when you will be triggered or if the skills you have learned will take you through the moment. Remember to be kind with yourself as you process this.
I will always support you Will. Your my favorite movie star for life
He’s an actor. And he cherry picked the questions to answer. Stop being so easily fooled
Opinion: psychologically can I walk away. Can I step out "my" (THE) front door, look around then walk forward
Will, we love you. You’re still a positive role model. We’re not perfect. We do make mistakes. The most important part is that we learn from it. You’re an incredible human being. Continue to grow. Continue to shine. God bless.
I’d like to believe you are sorry. I’m struggling to feel any sincerity from this video. It almost feels that your amused by this. It may just be my perception of your expressions, actually I hope it is. I do hope you can repair all the relationships that have been broken as a result…
You're a good man. We all make mistakes. I really hope that the media and the world will see the same at some point soon. I hope you keep going with your work
You are still loved
Man cut the crap Will. You make it look like its a business presentation with all these over the top hand gestures.   Almost like your "selling" your apology to us
Awwww i love you Will❤❤❤❤
"WE LOVE YOU WiLL" ❤️
It's weird, I had a dream recently with you discussing this very topic.   I've always admired how publicly you've conducted yourself. I know that I was disappointed by your action but at the same time weirdly relieved as well.   I can only imagine the pressure of maintaining this public perception is incredibly taxing. I've personally idolized you for all your positive actions. I believe this action that harmed Chris and many others can still be a positive example.   I hope you're not too hard on yourself, as we are all human. That's the relief I've gained from this moment, as I intend to be in positions of example. Mistakes are made, and we all deserve love still.   I know that as long as you continue to operate through love, in time, we can heal ( You and Chris most of all ) and benefit from the example.   Keep your head up. Be patient. And we all look forward to seeing the growth gained as a result.
We love you Will! You had a moment of weakness. It’s a learning experience. ♥️
Do the work Will.  We're here for you man.  We're all human, just trying to figure this thing out.
Will I applaud your taking the steps to bring healing to this situation for everyone and especially yourself. People who have truly loved and followed you through the years know the type of person you are. I will continue to pray for you and don't get discouraged if there are those who do not understand or forgive. Concern yourself with the forgiveness and love God offers you...It will set you free! God bless  ❤️🙏🏽🙋🏽‍♀️
The most admirable thing a person can do is admit fault and learn from it. No one is perfect. And God willing we get to wake up another day and just be better. As someone who saw on tv what happened, I thought...What would Jesus do in response? I am still a huge fan. Always will be. Cowards make excuses and you didnt do that. Im getting your book one of these days. I know that we can learn alot from others story. God bless you. 🙏💕
Love u both....you're my fav though. Glad to see you back. I hope collectively we can all move on and forward.
Highly edited apology videos are useless. Do it one take, warts and all, or expect incredulity from the public
#LeaveJada
I love you Will. Emotions can make you do crazy things. Just make this right. We know youre a good man.
And this is why I’ve been down with you from day one. You are a sincere dude. We all fall down at times. Stay blessed and keep moving forward❤️
We love you Will, we will always be with you on the road to greatness in either good or bad times. People make mistakes, but only strong people do apologies, accept their mistakes and learn from them.
Much love. Forever a fan!
Is it just me or has everyone changed their opinions?
💪🏼
I will never watch a Smith film again.
Fool
What about Paul Rodriguez? Did you hear what he had to say about the experience he had with you? That was the moment you lost me as a fan. It would be nice if you could address that.
Will this apology is trash. No lie you gotta let Chris get his lick back 🤷🏾‍♂️
We love you man ❤️
He needs to face criminal charges and explain his actions in court and a suitable punishment needs to be given to him such as community service. Celebrities are not above the law and fans forgiving him doesn't mean anything.
Had to be done Will, I believe you truly regret your actions that night.
I’m with you man, we are all human it’s all good
respect for owning up. still the 🐐
Okay . Good boy . Don’t repeat it again . Go play .
Your still my favorite actor and i hope things get better soon will keep being you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm glad to hear you're not ashamed, because you shouldn't be. Please don't give the "disappointed" public too much power. You've already apologized
I see a Great Man. We all fall short.
I love and suppoet what you stand for. We all make mistakes. This is a learning experience for you and so many many others.  This was for other people too. ❤
Get a divorce dude. Your whole family is crazy.
The good thing about you Will is that you knew what you did was wrong and that is great. Unlike others that run away from their mistakes and don't apologize which is so selfish. I know some people will avoid you because of the action of what you did but bare in mind that you can go forward and move on. Bless you.
Let him smack you back…
Will, I hope you and your family have a lovely blessed day!🥰
Always got my support brother. You can’t let ppl down that you don’t know and whim don’t know you
No other celebrity will ever do something like this on their. Whether or not its receptive is irrelevant. This grown man ish right here
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself. I'm human. I made a mistake" There's a lesson for us all.
Desperately waiting to see you back on the silver screen King 👑 nothing but love to the Fresh Prince 💞
Apology accepted. We’re all allowed to make mistakes. I’m sure Chris will forgive you as he has a big heart. You’ve had time to learn and reflect,and ultimately it will make you a better person.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Welcome Back!!!
You may not see this message. But I just wanted to say I have followed your career since the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , your music, and your movies. I'm 52, just because I'm white, still I have looked up to you as a big brother. You've always kept it real.. you mean a lot to a lot of people. Thanks for being there when I needed you !! 🇺🇸 Virginia, USA
Ahhh.... The slappaholic... How have you been??
Nice gesture, but still he doesn't look like he is truly apologizing to Chris, the hardness of saying his name struck me... Altho he looks truly sorry for Chrises and his own family...
I’m really glad you have this sincere apology, Will x
By the age will is, if you're in a career, or you've gotten to the point that you need to issue public apologies for your behaviour, man, just step out of it all.
I love you Will..... I believe in my heart that you, Chris and  Tony will be good again. We've all made mistakes and done things where we sat back after the fact and said how we could've handled things differently. I truly feel this incident is reparable and life will go on. Thank you for taking time away for yourself and posting a live video that you didn't have to post. I'm a day one of you and Chris and will continue being supportive of you both. Thank you!!!
Still love you! Still one of your biggest fan! He that is without sin, cast the first stone. ❤️❤️
Love you willl
There was a time when I couldn't even look at a screen with your face in it but this real apology is getting me halfway there. I want to hear Chris say he forgives you then we can do the same. And I want to see you try to make amends for what you did. But your not the anti-christ that some people would like to make you out to be. You made a bad mistake but you don't deserve having it held over you to define u the rest of your life. But for now all I can say is, this is a good step forward
LMAO
We all do stupid things, it's going to hurt a bit but you will be ok ✌😎
Will Smith! You are a good man. Good men make mistakes too! Thank you for doing the work to become an even better man. We need your light.
It’s Jada’s fault anyway.
For me?  You didn't "Let Me Down". The media sure loves keeping the 🔥 burning and tearing hero's down, especially people of color. Anyone who feels that way needs to "remove the bead from their eye, 1st".  So much pressure evvverrryday, Will.  You're human and that's THE BOTTOM LINE. Your embarrassment and regret is enough.  That's who you were "In that moment".  Not before.  Not after.  One of the things I dislike about our culture, if not modern world culture, is it takes A Moment, a event ect and freezes it forgetting a lifetime of "Good and Struggles" and identifies the person with That Moment.  It's A Moment not A Person so, Forgive yourself and forget those who don't or won't.  They "came out in the wash".  Now there's room for a quality of people that resonate with you, your Humaness and your New Path that began That Moment.  Many blessings to you Will ✨ Many blessings ✨ It's a valuable lesson you've learned.  Let's hope others "learn" from it, also 🙇
He looks so depressed. Don't worry bro. We won't judge you. We love you 💖 lots of love from india 🇮🇳
People make mistakes. Thats why we are people.
You should have called him, joined him, and then made something public and asked for forgiveness.... do not do more show, that you lost credibility
Will bro…you’re a legend, don’t worry about it you e saved many lives with your films and series, we all make mistakes, it’s just everyone saw yours, you’ll be back!
Well said Will one love my friend we all do stuff at time without thinking and we have to suffer or live with the consequences, i respect you as always i hope in time Chris will forgive you blessed one love
I hope you sort things out with chris
💪🏿✊🏿 I still love you.You are Human.💜💯
Best Youtuber apologies video I’ve seen so far
We all make poor choices. And I felt you on wanting to feel remorseful without spiraling into depression. What a heartfelt apology. I look forward to seeing you make good on it. 🫡
We're all human, and we all make mistakes. It's important to be self-aware, don't be too hard on yourself ❤
Will aint gotta apologize for nothing. Will been holding us down for years!
This is still going on? 😆
It's so hard to see someone so wonderful like you almost...on your knees... apologizing as if you had done something really terrible. I can't believe how many people feel morally superior and have lashed out at you with the help of the media, as if we all haven't lost control at some point. Always Team Will. Even more now.
Vc e foda mano não se abale, quem te merece  sua história não vai ser apagada por um tapa seu fam aqui
Hello, BRAZIL
So, I just want to say I commend you on having the courage to admit your wrongdoing, and that it takes a while to process everything that went on, and still going on. I completely understand that you’re human and making mistakes is our nature. I’ve watched you since I was a little girl, and I always had the most respect for you as an actor and artist. I just hope that you don’t allow the negativity and backlash change your artistry, change the Will we all loved at one point or another. You have self-healing that needs to come out of this situation, which will be a process that should be documented. Not like your book documentary. Something different, something special! I hope you can have a sit down with Chris so you both can be transparent about what happened and what the future would look like when you guys are in the same room together. I’ll pray for you guys. Yes, even famous people need prayer! I can’t wait for a new project from you Will and enjoy life to the fullest, you only get one!
Will is a good man, everyone makes mistakes maybe ones far worse than this. No one can judge.  “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her”
you are sensacional
❤Still love you, Will❤
You gon be alright tho bro 🤞🏽
Glad your back and much love and prayers. You are human and we all fall short. You are worthy and the issues is not life or death and can be repaired with work. I'm praying for everyone involved and wish you and your family the best. God be with you and stay strong.
Before this enters the media circus. You're an outstanding man and respectable for this video.You've always been my role model and this shows it takes a real man to admit they were wrong. I suggest everyone reads your book, your actions make sense then.
Nobody is perfect in life's arena
Your human as long as you know wrong you can get pass this
Nice talk
Everyone stumbles, now it's time to pick yourself back up and move forward.  I have faith that Chris will reach out and the two of you will be able to push through this and come out as friends.
I am still rocking with you,  no matter what .
O kaly senti na huwa kar
i appreciate 🙏 the msg and reflection...i too am a work in progress. bless you and yours cheers. still rockin with you, here's to being human....p.s i also share the disappointing others trauma
Temporary insanity. Period.
I have much love and respect for you and your career one bad moment doesn’t erase 30 years of excellence you’ve displayed all you can do is what you’ve just done which is apologize for your actions now wipe your eyes and start planning your comeback from one philly brother to another go out and win again
This sounds heartfelt. I hope that him and Chris can have a private conversation in the future.
I’d love Pewdiepie to make an apology video review on this, seemed really genuine! Keep it up Will
Still have respect for Will Smith, we all human
❤️🙏🏾
Very heartfelt. Couldn't have been easy to do. Can only hope this accelerates the healing process moving forward.
Will, this was much appreciated to hear.  And hey, some of us know where you grew up.  We also know that you had to suppress your edge to really stand out in Hollywood.  I really hope the reconciliation between you and Chris happens sooner than later.  Just saying, but you're one of the most influential people of our time, and I want to see you rise from this...kinda like Hancock, actually...see, man...you're even starring in your own reference
You a Libra and I understand why you can’t explain that moment and one thing I know is you not a bad person. He’ll come around and we still love you both!
Love you Will ❤️ Peace & Blessings to you, your family, Chris and Chris family.🙏
Love u will❤❤❤
I question your intent with this “apology” especially why it took so long for you to, as any mature man would, realize it was wrong IMMEDIATELY. But, there is this belief in the world of celebrity that says you remain the age at which you became famous. Too little, too late to make up for a humiliating and disgusting display. As I would tell a toddler…use your words.
This too shall pass.
no way this is still a topic of discussion 😭 yall are like 50 and 60 years old
hope he sues
Would love to see you and Chris sit down face to face. The black men in our community need to witness two of our brightest stars make amends to one another. Everything happens for a reason. God bless.
I don't think you did wrong, other than the timing. When you're at work, you're at work. Handle yourself accordingly. After work, that's when it's personal time. That's when you handle personal stuff. Keep doing you, and stand up. You were so great when you did you, the world be damned. The last few year, it seems you're spending too much time becoming the you the world wants. But goof on you for doing what you think is right. Your character is dependent on what you do, not what others want you to do.
It’s okay will we all make mistakes,don’t put pressure on yourself
Where there’s a ‘Will’ there’s a way
Stop deleting comments if you're really sorry . Man up! since you've been spoiled since the fresh prince days. Treating people like they're below you.
Welcome back Will 🙏 some people are faux disappointed.  They love to tear down when they have done much worse 🤧
really hope will and chris figure this out and the attention would be focused on something more important
This apology just shows what a great man you are for taking the responsability, when the other part didn't seem to take any for the insult. I would consider answering one more question: What you would say to the people who have gone through bullying and that have to take offenses over and over? What lessons did you learn on the best way to handle these kind of situations that you could teach us?
The apology is the first step, our actions after the apology is what counts. I hope everyone can heal from this.
Thank you for this apology. You're human and a good man who made a mistake.
It’s a lot to unpack, and he’s trying to address/repair the damage. He’s a human being, imperfect and made a terrible decision to inflict harm on another person. It’s excusable, and parts of it are likely irreparable as he stated.   I’ve done things, said things and acted upon things that I deeply regret myself.   So I understand the feelings of remorse and at times; self-loathing over bad decisions.   I’ve always believed that the best of people make the worst of decisions at times.
I wish you peace, love and happiness.  I hope you escape this madness, this media mess.
Will, You will get through this! For the pass few months, I sure their a lot in your head. Keep fighting my Hero!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have also f*cked up before. I can’t imagine what it must be like to have the eyes of scrutiny of so many on the one thing you want to hide.
we still love you Will....all is forgiven
Will💯
No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. Let this be a learning experience to everyone. We love you Will. We love you Chris.
Beautiful
If this ain’t accountability I don’t know what is. He didn’t owe us anything. The fact that he was compelled to do this is a great personal work for him. A Libra is going to own their mess in due time. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wish he would have shouted out CODA at a time when we should have been talking about the moment a pioneering movie made by deaf artists about the deaf experience we were talking about Will Smith and his ego. He looks like he is owning it and in a healthy way but it’s going to take more than a few words to fix his reputationz
Bro man just leave her, she belongs to the streets.
Now let's see what Mike Tyson will do about biting Evander..
Still one of my favourite actors.Nobody is perfect in this world not even Andrew Tate lol.We all hide secrets.😁
Chris had it coming and I don't feel sorry for him.
I've been with you since day one. I'm still hear with you will love you bruh.
God bless you sir. Stay up. Reach out... God bless you man.
Wow, more likes than views
Will  your back
Everyone makes mistakes, unfortunately this happends in front of the spotlights
To err is human, to forgive is divine. It will all work itself out in the end Will. Stay up
Proud of you Will 👏🏽👊🏽
The hardest thing to do is to forgive ourselves. You made a mistake, which makes you human. You continue to inspire me and please know that you are loved 🥰.
Keep being an amazing example Will! You are the best of the best!
Wow..This made me cry.  Forgiveness is healthy.
Welcome back Will, we missed you!
I’ve moved on. Sorry mate
Good to see you Will Smith.  I’ve always admired you.  I’ve loved your inspirational messages throughout the years even more than your work in movies and tv.  You are and always been a good man.  I hope you are well and all is forgiven.
I'm a very big fan of you, Will. We love you so much. You didn't let us down and you didn't lost any love. You are the best, don't forget that.

Proud of you for this video!! Continue moving forward this was a big step! Love you Will!! 💓
Always love u bro ‘!! Niggas fucc up but now it’s time to bounce bacc .
We've all had hard times in Life or done something with regret later...Were Human. Your In the Spotlight...thats the Difference. It took alot of Courage to make this Video. Give yourself Grace Will. 💙
Thank you for being a human being. Humility and humbleness is refreshing to see and hear. God bless you Will and your family. I’m still a fan and I pray God gives you peace and good health.
He is one of the goats good apologies 🐐
Mad respect and love for Will!  This is a tough thing to do for anyone ....especially under public scrutiny.  #Human
We love you will!!!
You're a good man, Will. It was a moment of madness that doesn't define you and we'll still support you. It wasn't the worst crime in the world. Chris is no saint. He needs to apologise too. Remain blessed
To err is human.  To hell with the world media.
I was in the "disappointed" category. Even shortly after when I was asked about this I could tell the moment got the better of you and you reacted rather than thinking. I told someone verbatim what you said in this video, "He's human, he's going to make mistakes. He's not acting like it wasn't wrong."   All that being said, I appreciate the effort to show remorse. As one of those people that had admired your work and was deeply disappointed, I forgive you.  We can be friends again.
Love you! Always with you, Will❤️❤️❤️
The only people that need an apology are Chris and his family. People can have an opinion wether you're right or wrong but at the end of the day its nobody's business. Hopefully you can both sit down and figure it out, that's the only thing important here.
Sorry doesn’t cut it. He should have been arrested. That was a disturbing moment that we won’t soon forget. He could have yelled but you can’t go around striking people. Anyone else would have been arrested.
Will, you get nothing but love and respect from me. And countless others. We understand and we love you abundantly. May God continue to bless you and your family 💜💜
Oh to heaven with people's image of you! Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone lets everyone down. You made a mistake, yes and you are apologizing to Chris and to those directly connected to the fallout of the mistake. Don't beat yourself up over letting anyone down. They will be alright.
I'm just wondering, were you drinking before that happened? It looked like something a teenager might do in a club after a few too many.
We’re imperfect Will.🌻 We make mistakes. We love you!💞
Everybody makes mistakes. Even your idols.
You had me at hello! I can feel your sincerity.
Bro, everyone but you can see the problem. You need to leave her, move on, start again with someone who's not an egotistical narcissist.
how does this impact lebron’s career though??
Mad love Mr Smith. Your still my favorite guy man. Love you bro
T'excuse pas , ta bien fait , le respect avant tout
You ain’t do no wrong in my eyes Will but there a time and place for everything
In a way I feel like, “Why now bro? Why you waited so long?” But after watching it in its entirety-it at least FEELS genuine. I’m just gonna wait and see what happens afterwards. Best of luck to you Will. I mean it. Best of luck on your journey back from all of this….
A lot of people will criticize and attack Will even for apologizing but unless you're a celebrity yourself you don't know what it's like to handle the spotlight for the majority of your life the way Will has had to. What he did was wrong, but if that's the only blemish on his life as a public figure then we ought to all extend compassion and understanding at a time where he needs it most. In America right now we have politicians who are as dirty and deceitful as a human being can be and yet we freely give our support to them. Let's not condemn this man, he can still give a lot of goodness to society.
If a regular person did what you did yes it’s easy apologies and disappear we’re all humans we make mistakes but as a celebrity is tough we will always see it as a betrayal and as a hypocrite you showed something and you did the opposite so you have to disappear imo 🤷🏻‍♂️ good luck
You are human.  I get it.  You did not let me down.  Will always remain a fan of your talent.  Continued blessings and glad to hear you continue to work on you.
I’m always going to love Will Smith, I just hope everybody heals from this situation and just moves on. Love and peace
Lame
Good job will this is the first step to get things better
Now that's an apology.
We all make mistakes! The important thing is you owned up to it and now it’s time for you and the rest of the world to move on!!
Jayda will be the downfall of this great man. He’s beginning to crack.
A man under pressure in a bad relationship can do pretty much anything. I'm out of mine after 10 years and still suffering on whether I've made the right decision as theres an 8 year old in the mix. God help you Will
You don't get to decide if "we" will be able to be friends again. You're not in charge of anyone's response to your actions. That's really the first step. Acceptance.
Love you Will. I’m not mad at the smack. I’m just mad it was in front of the world. 🤷🏽‍♀️. You’re good!
🙏
I Love You Willard !!! Keep your head up, it was a mistake you acted off impulse!! And took accountability hold your hedge up king !
I still don't believe he did it.
1.product placement everywhere   2. Chris is on stage with Kev Hart joking about it   3. Will still a great actor
Your human and things happen.   My support will never waiver.  Love and Light!
I can appreciate and respect the fact that you reached out to Chris before posting this video. Hopefully, he will reach out to you soon. If not, you are still on the right path. I believe that you are a stand up guy and you deserve forgiveness and grace.  Blessings to you Will!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Will smith made a mistake let’s move on and keep watching his movies (he is still the best male actor to me )
Will Smith is not the first person to be caught up in the moment & make a mistake. Choices have consequences but Will has lived up to his mistake & is worthy of public forgiveness. Let’s all move forward now.
welcome back will !!
We all make mistakes whats important is getting back up and learning from your mistakes
Yeah this is the best way to do this!
Ain’t no way he gonna forgive you .. Somethings you can’t take back playa..
He looks like his father
Much respect to Will Smith for this.
Still is still the flyest out there. Everyone makes mistakes. Its about how you bounce back.
We love you well . You are an amazing person and nothing will change that. God bless 🙌
Cringe
Respect
We love you Will
We never stopped loving you Will!! Praying for all involved 🙏🏾🖤💞
*That was sincere- I’ll give him that*
I still don't believe that he did this. It is like it was in a dream
love you Will!! stay strong and grounded homie!
Was this filmed on the set of “Between two ferns”?
Major impact, and you are a role model for others.  Thank you. Even after fighting people making Peace is good, its just like one Big Family. I'm glad to see you confront this head one must be tough and hope everything can get back to normal considering everything. Your Strong and a Good person do you and do your best I Believe in you
Questions and answers is not the best method to choose to do a first apology video.
I'd love to see this type of sincere humility and apology from dozens of celebrities in entertainment who have been severely abusive, either psychologically, physically, or s*xually to their co-stars and colleagues. But of course, we'll never receive that from truly awful people. Will never fell under that category. He's a good dude who had one bad moment.
its all good mayne
yeah no lol
Be honest people. How often do you see a big public apology like this? He could've just left the issue rest because 90% of people pretty much forgot about it. He dug up the issue to explain things and apology. This is a true step up
i also have a question: when will you get out of that obviously toxic relationship youre in, that fucks you up so much that you explode in live tv?
4:53 you should be ashamed of the way you acted, what?
We still love will 💕💕💕
Hope you learned from this.
Nigga you thought you was Pac that night huh? 🤣
You do 99 good deeds and people torment you for 1 bad one. I kinda hate this about the world. Keep on being. No one is perfect. People love to sit outside and judge others, but they never do the same to themselves.
Will smith is a HORRIBLE human being
You made a mistake man, I am sure many like myself understand why you did what you did even if it was wrong. We see many people make what is clearly false apologies and yours comes across as sincere. I hope you can take this experience and use it to make your self not just a better man but in time a happier one.
I'm proud of you.....  I'm proud of Chris too.    God bless our men.   Let love  compassion and forgiveness abide in the hearts who have been impacted.    God,  I pray you mend broken hearts and spirits
We were all confused. Wishing you and everyone peace.
Will, This Too Shall Pass...
This is probs the best acting will smith had done so far… ur fooling nobody buddy
We never stopped being friends and never Will.  I think people need to be more forgiving and allow people time to grow and see.  This was a sincere apology!  My fav actor, my dude, I forgive you!  I pray that God turns this all in the favor of YOU AND CHRIS!  God knows how to get the glory out of EVERY STORY!   Welcome back FAV!  You’ve been a great exAmple for many years!   You’re allowed to make mistakes and deserve our forgiveness!
this has been blown way out of proportion and gone on for too long, you can't tell me this is just for publicity and they're going to stretch it out as far as they can
Commendable. Thank you for this offering and doing the work to heal. We can tell a lot by a person by how the deal with the lows. Peace King Will
Good stuff Will! We are all human, flaws and all. Trying to be perfect and live up to others’ expectations has got to be tiring. That’s why I thank God for Jesus who was God’s perfect son and by faith in His perfect work and sacrifice, makes us righteous and in right relationship with our Heavenly Father despite our shortcomings. Lay down that load, talk to Chris when he’s ready, but leave this extremely genuine apology right here for those who choose to accept it and move on with your life because clearly everybody else has. Blessings my brother! ❤️ and ✨
You are attempting to mend this, and that in itself is you being a stand up guy! You will certainly get through this. So proud of you Will. Stay strong🧡💪🏾🙏🏾God will bring you through this.
I appreciate that you seem unreservedly sorry.  I always found you to have so much joy and positive energy in your videos.  I hope you can get to that place again.
We're all human and are works in progress. No one is perfect, we all make mistakes, a lot of people make worse ones than what occurred that night. The difference being that our actions aren't broadcasted. Since you've written that book, you've delved deep within and pulled up some past traumas. Doing that kind of emotional work can make those feelings rise to the surface from time to time. My humble advice is to keep working on yourself so you can break the cycle of your upbringing. The fact that you are willing to take accountability shows you should be given another chance. Wishing you and your family the best.
Nice job Mr. Smith...well done. I genuinely hope there can be full forgiveness (given and received) for everyone involved. You're a very good man, Chris is a very good man, and I hope much positivity comes from this negative situation.  You have been missed, and hope we start seeing you more on the socials.
Everyone makes mistakes Will. Respect.
A man takes ownership and responsibility. This said, there aren’t a lot of them out there. Thanks Will.
I wouldn't have apologized.
If this were a live stream I’d have given it more credibility…
No one is perfect. Keep striving king!!
Will Smith is human. He is not God. We all make mistakes, that we wish we could take back.  I pray that him and Chris will be able to amend this and move on. As for the rest of us, let it go ! We have some bigger issues in this world that we need to focus on. Keep going Will !
A real man knows his mistakes 💯 👌 we needed this from you will may God be with you and your family and keep giving you the strength 💪 🙏 that's what happens when you hold things in that was the straw that broke the camels back....
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🇰🇪
with the merch baseball cap, this is marketing
We love you Will. Understand we never left you we only wished for the best and celebrated you through out All of your life. You are human. Be strong.
I lost all respect for this man
People are shocked when a nice or sweet person does something bad but they expected and laugh at it when a person that's bad all the time does something they're a rappers that literally have shot people and beat people up and they get applauded and loved Will Smith is a rapper that has never done anything wrong he did one mistake and Bam is over it's ridiculous
Mistake Made & apology given so let's move on simple👍🏾! To be totally honest only those involved needed this and not everyone else on the sidelines but I get it.🙄
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
For all those pointing the finger remember you have 3 pointing back at you. It is admirable to except the consequences of your actions and take accountability as well. We all can say why did he did that? I would have done it differently but no one really knows what they would have done. Instead of judging let someone’s mistake be your lesson.  Will is a man in process as we are ALL in process try to progress.
Ahhhhhhhh the heavy sigh that's hot
Welp time to add Will Smith to the YouTuber apology tier list
It's never too late to reflect, learn, and move forward. Thank you for taking the time needed to look into the root of the problem and good luck as you continue with your life journey and healing. Sometimes we can be too hard on ourselves.
Well all the cussing you didn't do in rap over 30 years, you tarnished  it in one night 😣😑
Love you Will Smith, that's it, that's all...IMO
You have been a role model to me. Rooting for u.
Will is only human and he's apologised for his actions. Judging further then that is wrong of us and we need to forgive him. He's a great actor and without him I wouldn't of been able to have such a awesome childhood.
🙄
Who missed this guy? 🙋🏻‍♂️
Hey man its all about growth  We all make mistakes but the most important thing is to learn from the. Like I was once told after losing a game of basketball, "cheer up, there's no loses in an L there's only lessons to learn from the L". You have dome great thing will smith and people will always remember those as well. I hope you find peace after this.
Ok crazy person. Lol
He a geek
Will does not deserve anything but hate. You proved you are not a human in your behaviour. An apology is not enough
Absolutely no shame in being human Will. I wish I could give you a hug and tell you what a wonderful human you are and how much you are loved. Also you don't have to live up to the image or expectations the world has of you. You have to live up to being you. That's it. And it's not easy, but that's it.
We are all human we all do bad things that suck. It’s part of being human. And I think ur experience in your lifetime would not be complete without it
Things like this wouldn't be such a let down to people if they didn't expect celebrities to live up to their unrealistic expectations. It's not the celebrities fault for being human and letting you down, it's your own fault for making assumptions about who someone is when you don't even know them. I know sometimes we can feel like we know these people because we've seen their faces and heard their voices our entire lives but the truth is, it's all a persona. That persona is a major part of their job and there's nothing wrong with that.  Just be wary of building someone up in your head and projecting qualities onto them. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed and setting the other person up to bear the burden of guilt for having failed you. Celebrities are human beings, just like us. The only real difference between us is a job title.  *And life takes its toll on us **_ALL._*  And as for Will:  I wish you nothing but the best and a lifetime of health, love, and happiness.
I still love you Will!
Respect. Much respect.
He def had sleepless nights!
You know what you need to do to gain your peace back...
He was honest open reflective took responsibility for everything he’s got my acceptance and empathy the dude went off is clear now I forgive him. Let’s move on🙏🤷‍♂️🙏Dr Ronald Alexander
Love you Will... this life thing is a marathon... From one Philly guy to another... wishing you peace my g
We are not the sum of our worst mistake 🙏🏿
It takes a big person to apologize, accept their faults, and try and learn from their mistakes. We are all here waiting for your return Will.... when you are ready.
We love you Will. The culture loves you. The world loves you. Thankfully most of us don’t have to walk through life with a glass held up for everyone to see every misstep we make and there’s no one there to constantly remind us. I’m ashamed of the comics and celebs who vilified you and left you out to dry. I’m sure most of them did it to follow the crowd, get publicity for themselves, or just because they’re jealous of you. But as I said, we love you, the culture loves you, and the world loves you. We’ll be there when you decide to return. We’ll buy every ticket, see every movie,TV Show, guest appearance, and social media post you make. Because we love you.
Will....tu eres una buena persona y tú mereces cosas buenas
Love you Will. I have never lost my respect for you. You lost your s***. Happens to everyone. You are human. You still have a fan in me. I watch all your movies and I think you are a wonderful person. Watch Independence Day every July 4 no matter what!!! Take care of your self.
Will apologises when his pockets are hurting.
Thank you king. You took time away, collected yourself and came back when you felt ready. Thank you for being sincere and taking accountability. You have carried the burden ( weight) of being Mr. Hollywood ( especially for African Americans like myself) and showing us we are represented and we can be successful. You made a mistake but that doesn’t dim the light I see in you. You’re special, a massive talent and I support you and am happy for your healing. Continue to evolve and grow 😊
Well his EGO was squashed. Good. Humbling your self is proof enough that he let HIMSELF down as well. That's where a TRUE apology starts. Good job Will....I forgive you.
Everyone makes mistakes. For those of you saying he should be canceled and acting like you don’t make them. Thank God you weren’t canceled when you made mistakes
We all human and we all make mistakes. It’s how we come back from the mistakes that matters
So proud of him.
Уилл, все правильно ты тогда сделал на церемонии. Извинения должен приносить не ты, а подонок, который смеет шутить на такие темы. Мне очень жаль, что у вас в стране настолько все прогнило, в том числе и чувство собственного достоинства, мне жаль!
We all make mistakes. That doesn't mean mistakes have to define who we are. You are a remarkable human being living a remarkable human experience. Thank you for all the joy you have brought to the world for so many years. I know more is yet to come. Praying for you always.
Man I love this guy and all ways Will   *Pun intended*
That’s the way we do it
Everyone liked? Tf?
Learn from it and move on. I hope things can get back to some normality for you, Chris, and everyone affected.
Thank you for this.....
This dude still looking for attention
I normally don't post, but I want to add this to the conversation. It was a bad moment for all, but you know what...life goes on. Saw this today and I think 13:15 match perfectly for this time in Will's life. https://youtu.be/_alcE8PfzbI
Say what you want. I respect Will for being A MAN and standing on his mistake and ill behavior. He knows better and he will be better. Still love and respect Chris and Will. Hate shouldn’t live here.
I think what got me the most was when he discussed his central trauma of disappointing people. We are not all perfect and we make mistakes. The battle he faced within himself and trying to fix his image for the world shows that he is trying to heal and heal those he hurt. I never stopped hating him for what he did but mainly because if it was any other person, they would have done the same thing and possibly feel the same after it happens. You definitely have my support and just know that you are human. We all make mistakes and we also need that time to heal. Stay strong, you will overcome this!
❤️
I'm soooo happy to see you back! I've missed you a lot! 💕💕💕
Ooooooooo aaaaaaaaa sheeeeeeeesh
We love you Will!
Everybody deserves a second chance. And people make mistakes, sometimes horrible mistakes. But learning and growing from them, is the best you can do. And accepting an apology is the best we can do.
sometimes ya gotta smack the scense into someone.. chris deserved what he got. he got smacked the "not that funny" out of him. some mofo's need to think twice befor hurting someone.. words DO hurt.. RESPECT Will. nothing to appoligize for. you are one hell of a good guy.
No matter what he does, he's still the freshest prince 🔥
Ayyy great to see you again brother, we've missed you
After a creer of almost 30 years , one mistake can end your life . but we forget that we are all humans. #forgivness-peace-balance
Apologize, accept and forgive, move on. Acceptance and forgiveness is good for the soul
😒
This just seems pure PR. His team have told him to go away for months, come back with this, go away for a little bit more and then everything will be okay.
ANY TRUE SOUL KNOWS YOUR HEART! ITS LITTERALLY NO ONES PLACE OR BUSINESS TO JUDGE YOU WILL. ITS SHAMEFUL U HAVE TO FEEL U OWE ANYONE ANYTHING. AND BIG OF YOU TO HUMBLE YOURSELF IN SPITE OF IT! NO SHAME, YOUR STILL AN AMAZING SOUL, AND THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE OF YOU. YOU ARE LOVED!
Thank you Will! We are all human and it’s a tough task to not let your less than stellar actions/moments define who you are. We all make mistakes and it’s the responsible thing to apologize. I am proud of you and I am proud of Chris (hopefully one day you two can sit down and clear the air in private of course).
Your still one of my favorite actors , I pray that their can be forgiveness between all party’s , God bless you will and your family
No forgiveness,  it's just a media response,  you embarrassed yourself , your family,  Chris,  your race .... this is meaningless
You're an AMAZING human being!!  I know you were hurting immediately..... during the past few months I prayed for you. YOU ARE hands down the reason I became a conscious writer in poetry. You inspire, and encouraged us all to be better humans by your example!!  You are human, and we love you for who you are!!  #1Fan Don't beat yourself up about it! Thank you for the video. Been missing you!!
Good way of taking ownership and making a public response and also being aware nothing said or actions taken can take back what occurred. Your acknowledgement of that and the humility, along with guilt really shown through the lens here. I appreciate you for this video.
The way he talks like his been memorizing this speech for a month
Now, breathe.
It took him 4 months to decide if he's wrong for what he did or not 💀💀💀
it’ll take some time to heal
Thank you for coming back. If I could only say just 5 words to you I would say... Let time do its healing.  It is now time for you to evolve into who you were meant to be on this Earth this whole time.
U good we love u fresh prince 🫅 forever🕉🥰🙏🏾
Good job Will. That was a sincere apology. If I were Chris I would accept the apology. All I want to add is this apology should've come a bit earlier. Either way, proud of you for stepping up and being a man and owning up to the mistake. 👍🏾
Stand up, dust your jeans off and resume life.  You're being a man with your apologies.   You've done all you can do so sit back and let karma finish with you.  Your career is just now starting.  Don't screw this one up.  Peace!
nice try Will. nice try....
So Glad to see you back. I hurt for Both Of You and I hope this can be resolved. You and Chris Are Amazing Individuals and I Admire You Both.
You did the right thing by owning up to this and apologizing for it.  Just continue to focus on self improvement and your mental health, it’s a valid concern to millions seeing someone many of us grew up with act so out of character.    Everyone’s rooting for the redemption
Can someone point out where he actually says "sorry" to Chris?  I don't mean to be that guy but "I apologize" and "I'm sorry" often mean two different things (albeit subtle).
Ah a collection to all my other YouTube apologise videos , I can feel his apologising generously not trying to beat around the bush 8/10 apology video
it feels weird being here so early before the press picks it up..... WE LOVE YOU WILL!!!!!!!!  Human beings aren't perfect. We aren't meant to be. We appreciate you for this video.
Love you Will, be strong. You had to to do what you had to do. We human and have mistakes, but we should just understand we do things that we are not proud of. Most of your fans still strongly love you, just be you my guy. Proud of you n' much love (*˘︶˘*)♡
You don't need to carry this forever, your accountability is enough.
I appreciate you for the totality of who you are, not just the parts that make others smile.  We truly need to apply this to everyone in our lives when they make mistakes on this level or less.  There are some errors that are beyond forgiveness but this is not one of them.
The video has 17k views at the moment, and it has 17k likes. That’s something..
Bro, that was a crap apology. I can teach you empathy and self control for a couple bugs.
Long over due apology and even if all his words are fake he at least said the words. The fact it's so over produced and chopped up makes me think it's fake but just saying the words is helpful.
Nahh should of post when chris is ready and have  a face to face apology like a real man. No respect.  Your following a script so you fans wont feel a type of way. Coward type of energy here.
Will smith is fake af, he wouldn’t of made this video if the he didn’t receive all that backlash. This is just an attemptto save face and restore whatever left of his reputation
Man you’re good uncle Will. You still the goat, you made a bad decision in the heat of the moment! No love lost we all make mistakes, as long as you learn from them !
Mannnnnnnn this video got me emotional 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
It's a start!! 💯
So the apology tour begins.  WS will now be on all the talk shows to rebuild his brand.  Frankly, I don't believe any of it.  He's only doing to repair his reputation.
Not convincing atall
All is forgiven king.
Simple misjudgment in handling his emotions at the time. We are all human and must endure the consequences of our actions. This in no way, shape, or form means that he is a bad person.
You have my support and I accept your apology. I hope Chris can forgive but if he can't, that is his right.
Life sucks for will rn
I just want to thank you so much Will Smith for making my childhood and my life meaningful, you are my role model and always been, I just want you to know that there's still people around loves you from a distance and have so much respect to you even if we didn't even spoke to each other. We all make mistakes in life that's how we learn to live our life. I hope you're doing great and in a good health and doing good deeds. I love you you man ❤️ from the bottom of my heart, I'm thankful for your existence.
I thought you died
We still love you Will. We’re all human and make mistakes. Wishing you love and continued healing to all.
Jobs are drying up, careers in tatters. Last resort
L
we love you will stay strong Jesus well work this out keep going I believe what you are doing ok Jesus got you
You’re a legend man❤️
is That Mean Will Smith is Done with His Movie Business 😥
That wasn't easy to do it in such a public way and I believe you are remorseful and looking to find a positive road forward. I think we have to put in perspective that you can't let a small incident define an entire life. I'm good with this and hope to see you on the  big screen again.
3 months to have a decision on what went on.. wow. It should have happened earlier if there was any credit to what you are saying..   And to read a SCRiPT blatantly with no emotion but the fact you are having a hard time reading the damn thing is complete BS.  It shouldn't have taken 3months if you were your true self... Your words aren't sincere and I CALL BS...
Walk on the  set...I  am not a  role model....Walk off the set...
When you hire writers and buy a teleprompter to get back to the spotlight...
You’re still our guy Will.
It's been a bit longer than a minute, are you on heavy medication?
I was upset with the humiliation CR just have felt but I can see the hurt in  Will Smith's eyes.
I’m so confused and in two minds about this. Will smith is/was an idol. He was fresh Prince , he was every character he played so well. 3 months on I can’t bring myself to watch something he is in anymore. But also, more importantly I know people make mistakes, hell, I’ve made many, it’s in our nature but it’s how we come back from them. I truly hope him and Chris sort things as that would be a big step to get my idol back.
L
While a public apology was certainly long overdue, Will you should do something for Chris that can be either personal and private that shows your sincere remorse for what happened or something public that will bring you both honor and respect and helps people or communities.  Just my 2 cents
Not only do you try to take accountability for your actions but you set the example for others and especially men that its okay to make mistakes but that it is critical to admit them and do the work required to heal ourselves and others affected by them.  Leading by example, and for that you deserve a lot of credit.  Much love Will
I love you Will 😍
Will Smith you are the best actor in the whole world and I am your biggest fan I watch all your movies and it is so good I wish you will come back again and I'm sorry about your career you done so many things for these people and I thank you for that and my name is tyshawn Jones I'm 15 years old and that is my message to you.
I am stil a fan. Good that he apologized.
While this is nice in a general sense, things like time, actions, awareness and growth will prove it, so let's see if you are who you say you are.
If you make an other MIB movie I forgive you.
Bro dropped the ball, but i respect fact that he's apologizing....alot of people don't do that even when they on the wrong.
Glad he didn't do Red Table.....but I think he should've done Gayle
I admire when people can own their mistakes and admit that they were wrong. It takes strength from anyone, but I can imagine the pressure of admitting a wrong doing at the level of someone like Will is daunting. He's right  we're all human, we've all made impulsive decisions that have wound up to be a big mistake in some form and hurt people in some way. But to constantly regret these things and think of yourself as a piece of s**t is mentally crushing. As a fan of both since the 90's-early 2000's and as a person thats been on both sides. I can understand both sides. It takes time to talk after an event like this, and most of the time. Relationships involved in this are damaged beyond repair.
Will you have brought a lot of joy and good energy to the world. I look forward to seeing more of your special brand of talent on display for years to come. Although this incident was totally unexpected I think we should all give our friends a little leeway and especially the good ones. Peace to you and yours man please smile at yourself in the mirror today.
Please show me someone that is perfect that’s walking this earth? I’ll wait 🧐 exactly . So that being said, everyone makes mistakes. Today is a new day ,try to become the best version of you on this day ❤️
Almost half a year to do this? I guess Will had no movie offers in that time and only made this video out of desperation
I just don't care and will never see a movie of his again.
I’m happy to see the comments are so positive.  I’m a big fan of your work and after the initial shock of what transpired on stage had left me I realized that you would of felt tremendous regret and embarrassment in that moment, so fast forward to now watching you own up to the mistake shows that you are generally sorry as suspected and for that you will always have my respect 👏
I know it takes a lot to understand what we have done. But it takes a big man to apologize for his wrong doings. Hope you truly meant what you said.
Yo….that’s how it done….According to Gods Word” A Righteous Man falls 7 times” So it’s what we do afterwards that Makes The Man. Keep Your Head Up Fresh Prince, We’re still here for you brother.
Love U will Smith 🔥
It’s been a very long minute! U have been rehashing what happened for three months? Painful to watch… but better late than never.
i still think it was all fake  😅
We love you Will. You’re making it right and that’s all that matters. We all make mistakes. You’re human and we’re rocking with you
We miss you
I don’t believe he is sorry at all. JMO
Good job brother💜🙏🏻
Thank you for the apology. I appreciate it.
why doesn't he apologize to the Williams family...he ruined their moment too and had the nerve to bring their Dad in as a justification for his actions
Love you always Will, good to see U again. You're only human, just like the rest of us. Still one of your fans, God Bless U💖
We’re you still in character as King Richard the protector that night?
We still love you Will ❤️
Disappointment is his central trauma. That says it all right there. He thought he would be a disappointment if he did nothing in response to Chris.
Everyone makes stupid mistakes , I hope you and your family are healing ok from what happened ❤️
I use to love Will Smith. Now whenever I hear his or his giant narcissist of a wife's name or see their faces, all I feel is utter disgust.  He will say anything to save his flagging career right now.  The time to say something was when he was getting his unjust reward.  You don't go dancing at a party after the stunt you pulled Will.  In the words of the Mafioso...you are dead to me.
We forgive you Will 🙏🏽🌺
This is the definition of cringe.
Love you Will. Never lost any respect for you and everyone makes mistakes. I loved your book, after reading it I felt I knew you in a way so I get where you're coming from and how you feel. Can't wait to see you on the big screen again 👍
What a insincere over produced apology.... of a man trying to get his career back
I Love You Will Smith!! At the end of the day we are all HUMAN!! Not one of us is perfect by any means! I was, and still am, a HUGE Will Smith fan amd that will NEVER change!!! Forever #TeamWill!!!
Thank you for doing this, Will. You made a mistake. We're human and that is how we learn,by making mistakes. I was very disappointed that you did that, but you are showing us how to come back from said mistake. I will always love you and support you. ❤️ Learn this lesson and move on with your life.  You have to much good to teach us. Love and peace of mind to you!
Feeling your message Will.  Everyone lets people down at one time or another, lets themselves down, makes mistakes.   No one will beat you up more than you will yourself...forgive yourself and know you are still an amazing man.
What happened?
Damn, the likes are the same as the views
Good work Will, it is about time.  That is what taking responsibility and making amends is about, it isn't easy and I applauded your courage.  You live.  You learn.  My faith has been restored. Now behave with all that fame and money!
But why did he take 4 months to apologise? Why not do so straight away or within a few days?
yes, we all forgive you Will
You are human and we all make mistakes you are still a great person love 💗
I was hurt by my hero, maybe i shouldn't have been, but you are a better man for taking the time to touch on what happened. And taking the time to apologize. Weather or not it will mend the situation. I respect you mr smith. Much love.
Will je t’écris à partir de Milan pour te dire que je t’aime beaucoup et que celui qui n’a jamais commis d’erreurs dans sa vie lève le bras. Sois fort, pense à tous ceux qui t’aiment et vis ta vie. Je t’embrasse très fort 🥰
Lost all respect for  this man  Since then

Hard words to say from a mistake the world saw. That said. I’m sorry is the road we all use to cross the bridge of healing. We have and at some point will make big mistakes.
Celebrities should not be a role model to anyone.
First of all you’re human we all make mistakes and are not always 100% at our best. I still & always will love you frfr. I don’t agree with your actions, half the time I don’t agree with my own actions. Acknowledging that you were wrong and actually trying to make things right is all that you can actually do.
It's tough to see your heros this way.
Love you a million percent Bro! You GOOD! We all make mistakes. #LOVE 💗💚
Soft af
He is different know
Apology video LOLLL
this man is clearly a sociopath
lowkey reminds me of those youtubers apology videos 💀
Forever rocking with you 💯‼️
thank you for being an inspiration too black kids like me forever. sending love from west philly
U are not or ever been a piece of anything, we make mistakes two super heroes in our eyes and will find a way to make this better, take care of your mental, we will be here ❤️
Love you Big Willy. Hope everyone is doing okay.
Stay close to Jesus, brother. We all need grace and forgiveness once we repent. God have mercy on each and every one of us ❤
Move on Will. You are a good man. I can see the pain in your face. Much love!
Sending you love Will. Bendiciones ♥️
Love everything about this, esp the part where you made clear you dont want to internalize the incident, thereby letting it taint your sense of value of self. Indeed, we are all human and make mistakes, but those mistakes should not define the sum total of who we are.
Jesus Christ, Will. All Russian men are with you. What a sick world when society wants a man to stop being a man and husband. Pathetic, simply pathetic. Whatever they make you say or do, you were right and still will be right every damn day because you are the man, the father and the husband protecting your wife's honor, your last name's honor.🙌
We love you will, we are all your family , I pray you and everybody else heals and come back 50x stronger from this .. Godspeed! The community needs you ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Nobody's perfect mistakes makes stronger and better person you will always have my support
I'll comment on this video later.. When all the publicity department human-bots get finished with their paid praising of him..
Mr Smith please know that we love and miss you. My grandson and I had a Will Smith movie marathon a few weeks ago. You made a mistake. You've apologized for it multiple times. But most importantly, please forgive yourself. Being a fearless perfectionist No One can be harder on you than Yourself. You are still a good man, role model, and human being. And please know that You're Are Still Loved! It's my prayer that there is reconciliation across the board for everyone and the institutions involved. GOD Bless & Keep You All During This Time. 🙏🏽❤
Love you Will.  I just hope you and Chris are able to repair your relationship,  or build one.   Former enemies tend to make the best friends.   That's all that matters.   Everyone else is just a bystander
You been damn near perfect your whole career and still got a bunch of hate. Not from me. You ain’t canceled over here 👌🏿
Still love you will
Oh, Will, I've done things like this that feel bigger than me when I was angry.  And I beat myself up over it for years afterward.  The truth is that the hardest part is forgiving yourself.  Please do that and allow yourself to move forward and past this incident.  Good luck to you.
Still blue pilled. My youth hero with Stockholm syndrome. Hurts.
Love you will hope things get better man
3 months for this junk? Irreparable.
This is the first step toward healing!  Forgiveness !  It’s a hard thing to do to humble yourself to ask for forgiveness.  You also have to be prepared for the person wronged to never forgive you.  However, the apology unburdens you.
Love you will!!!
love u will always 💓
Own your mistakes. Move on.   Will you have and will always be a fantastic role model to many people. You had a very human and emotional blip, the main difference is yours was televised for the world to see and then chastise. Much love ❤
thanks for the Meme
What I'm trying to say is.....I ruined my career, and I need to make movies again.
We all make mistakes, work to be better. No1 is perfect.
Will - understood.  As a fan and fam, we are good. Thanks for keeping us in the know and updated on this issue.   We can see you are genuine! This goes a long way with us as fans!!!
Thank you for this video.  You don't owe anyone a thing, but this video allows myself and others to get the opportunity to possibly understand what happened with you in that moment.  You apologized to the right people, and answered the tuff questions.   You are human, and although we wanted the image of Will Smith to be so perfect, that is impossible.   Thank you for taking time for yourself.  Thank you for being brave.  Thank you for sharing.  Please continue to work on your inner peace to resolve any trauma with in, and be you with out fail.   You are a remarkable man Will, super talented and loved by the world.  Thank you again king.  😁  I can't wait to see you on the big screen again.    Love Wes,  A Supporter
It's refreshing to see someone at Will's status show basic human error.  So many of the people who made it in Hollywood try to seem so perfect and without error. Will made a mistake...he's human and shows remorse.  The rest is on Chris on rather to forgive him or not. I believe he will.
If someone violates my girl I would’ve smoked them too lol
Will Smith is a legend in my book.
I feel like this is really only between Will and Chris. I get that they're both public figures and this happened on the world stage, but until the two of them can sit down together and make peace, it's all kinda moot. I'm happy to hear Will is working on himself, though. And I also hope Chris can one day find the inner strength to forgive him. It's a tough situation all around.
You're being too hard on yourself, Will. You made a mistake, a bad choice. You're taking accountability for your actions and that's what's important. You haven't let anyone down, you're human. The sadness I see in your eyes, the defeat, makes me sad. Your true fans are still your fans and this Philly girl will always root for you.
THE CAN TRY BUT THEY WILL NEVER BRING DOWN A LEGEND LIKE YOU ARE
Hey Will! I'm happy you had time to heal, prayers for your realtionship with Chris and all his Family/Friends. Wishing you the best recovery, and sharing some of my light with you.
🙏💯💯💯💯
It's been an hour...
We still love you Will we all have made mistakes so glad you are trying to make it right!
Love you Will. Hope you bounce back stronger from this!
I understand that you’re a human being so you never lost my support. I’m glad you’ve taken accountability publicly, you will move past this on to greater things like before.
Accept what is. Let go of what was. Have faith in what will be.
We all fall down!!! Good on you for coming out an apologizing when you felt ready on your time and not anyone else’s.
All the love to you Will.  We've all made mistakes in life, some bigger than others but that is part of being human.  God knows your heart and He will lead your way.  If anything, this has made you a better man, I'm sure.  God bless.
No one’s perfect. It take a real person, not just a man, to admit their mistakes. Taking accountability for your actions is one of the hardest things for people and I respect this man for doing that. Hopefully, he’s seeing someone for help. We all need it. Life isn’t easy for some. No matter if you’re wealthy or not. Keeping praying.
I’m glad you’re back! I missed you🥰
Just another Hollywood shame ritual, nothing special. Now go put on the dress again
Hmm ok, umm well, my best friend has literally beat the sh*t out of me in front of my mom. Get over it peeps.
The apology to his mother sounded sincere..............       Not so much the apology to Chris.
You cool with me,Will!!
Little too late. Inexcusable.
You’re Human! We Love You!! ❤️❤️❤️
One mistake shouldn’t smudge out a lifetime of great artistry and accomplishments. I knew you would do the right thing. This too shall pass. Love you Will ❤️
Accountability  #Lookup 🙏❤🙏❤🙏
you need to DIVORCE your CONTROLLER
I love you
You will never find happiness until you remove the toxic narcissist from your life.
You done f'd up
It's ok, Will! Still love you!
Why does he talk like a Robot?
I forgive you Will.
Well done on acknowledging your learning process through this. 🙏
People make mistakes, we are all human. I believe everyone deserves a second chance, no matter who you are. Always enjoyed Will Smith movies and TV shows, and think he is a good dude. I'm rooting for you sir!
It's all good will
Should rapped this. Like wtf
Proud of you Will, there will be people that make fun of this and make so many ignorant statements. One this that stand out you stated is that you ARE human. That’s what so many fail to understand. Mistakes happen, all you can do is build from them and be better.
People make mistakes, you made a big one, but that's okay. It's important to forgive, I hope you're doing okay ❤️
Lol this cringe af
Here go the "well it you long enough" comments 🤣 But to be real and in all seriousness what happened really did shocked the world. Its funny how one seemingly little thing can change everything. Both Will and Chris had to do their fair share of soulsearching and I knew Wills apology would be sincere and candid once he got it together but I can appriciate he took time to acknowledge that the incident had far reaching effects.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
MISSED YOU WILL!!!
No, you're not sorry, but there may be stupid people who will fall for this ruse.  You're probably doing this because you've lost some jobs or some money.  You weren't confused at the time, just watch the episode.  You were lucid, had time to think and acted, period.
It's all done so now the better thing to do is to set a nice example of how grown ups solve a problem
One day at a time, Will. I’ve always been a huge fan of you and you admitting that you were wrong and apologizing is the best we can ask for. Forgiveness can take time for some people but you have mine. ❤️ sending  love and prayers your way. Jesus gets you through times like this. Seek Him. ❤️🙏
that’s some really good work by his PR team, job well done
Kinda late with the apology
I mean lets be honest who hasnt smacked someone once? Lol
Should be ashamed of yourself. Attacked a man on live television infront of his family. You deserve nothing. All of the “Smiths” can go away forever.
We still love you man. You will never lose us
Honeslty, who are we to judge
Takes a brave man to speak so frankly like this.
That’s a good start.
We all have our moments! Good or bad, when we own our own and admit the wrong doing. I respect you so much more, you are a good person ❤ still one of my favorite people on earth. Take care of yourself 🙏🏽. God first.
Will, you're an amazing, inspirational person. What happened was a mistake and a lapse in judgement, however, you're imperfect, just as everyone is imperfect. True strength of character is what you've done from that point in time to now, and that's pause, reflect, and take accountability, even if  your actions seemed right to you at the time and may still seem right to some of us. Not to minimize what happened, I'd like to say this is not a debilitating mistake on your end. There are others who've done much worse and have never acknowledged it let alone take accountability and this is the first to see someone who is usually so calm, collected, and kind hearted lose control for a brief moment. It's a brief moment. You're loved and appreciated and although for me personally this wasn't needed, I am proud of you, never stopped believing in you, and you're still amazing and inspirational to me. Much love to you, your family, and true friends who love and support you. 🥰
We love you Will, I know for sûre that your light Will keep shining even brighter than before and you Will never stop inspiring us.. You are a gret human being, God bless you. 💜💜💜💜
I trusted you'd do the right thing and you didn't disappointed!
Yes u get too keep YouTube and you didn't hurt anyone.
Can’t remember why he didn’t say I’m sorry?! After he said he was ‘fogged out’ I was done. Don’t want to hear it. Bye Will.
I salute you. 👏🏾 👏🏾👏🏾
People make mistakes and some will regret their actions down the line. Life is about improving ourselves. Thank you, Will. People will eventually get over this and the ones who don’t, we’ll, they need to work their lives out as well.
So dissapointed in you Will.  I can't understand your behavior.
Hope you get better. Best of luck 👍
He deserves to be forgiven
Seems pretty genuine
At the end of the day, we are all human.  We have all acted in the moment and regret it later.   The fact he took time to reflect and think everything through before broadcasting a formal apology, speaks volume.  Will Smith will always be my favorite actor and role model.  Shine on brother ✊🏾
This won't break your Soul! Will Smith your mistake has been heard and your apology is processing. Thanks for the update
We love you Will.
“I’m Sorry for my family”… your kid was praising you for smacking someone 🤣🤣🤣
It might not mean anything to you or anyone else, but I forgive you Will. I hope you move on from this. I forgive you…
This is going to take some more time for Chris to process. Be well Will…
Will, I doubt you will personally see this, but... this is Tyler's grandma. I know you to be one of the finest human beings on this planet, always have been, always will be. You are so loved.  That is all.
*Greatest apologize video on YouTube*
Owning up to our mistakes and bettering  ourselves, is all the world can ask from any of us.
We are all human and we’ve all been here before, this was put out to public we understand. We love you will💖
love that he apologized. quit bashing this man because Chris was in the wrong too 🤷🏽‍♀️
Chris and his constituents aren’t ready to talk because they’re busy capitalizing off it 🤷🏾‍♂️
♥️♥️
Nobody is perfect EVERYONE has said or done things that we all wish we could go back in time & fix. Takes a real person to apologize & admit they were wrong.
:thumbs_up_emoji:
Respect✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Will Smith is only human, he is not your savior.
Will has Internet explorer, a bit late buddy
Respect
I can’t enjoy your movies, show, or music anymore bro. Legacy tainted
I disagree with not feeling shame. Shame brings accountability, and is the biggest driving force in not repeating bad behavior, no matter what the situation or people involved. Without shame, there is no true remorse.
In an hour 16k views ,16k likes….Will we don’t hate , really can’t , It’s a mistake…pure and simple
I’ve been a fan since I was a kid, but the idea that “you disappointed me” is so narcissistic on my part. This was between you and Chris, your fellow nominees, etc. It has *nothing* to do with me as a fan and you don’t owe me anything.
For what it's worth, Will, if you see this, just know that this is what I was waiting for.  This is that "accountability" that I felt was missing from your initial apology to Chris.  Thank you for this reassurance that you are the genuinely good dude I always imagined you to be.  Still a fan.
Nah will u been hidin huh🤣
what you did was vile...
It's rewind time! Ahhhhh....
You're one of the best actor of all time
Thank you for making this Will. You’re a good man
We all appreciate the effort and the sentiment... but the real problem is much closer to home... infact.. she lives with you..
I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize.
Love you Will! Keep working, keep being self aware and continue to grow! ❤️
CUCKOLD😂😂😂
I still love you Will! We’re all human. No one is perfect. Thank you for being real and about what happened! 💜💜
I miss will man 3;
I think this is good, you change, and expands as a human. "It", was really awful to see, toxic!!! But it is human to make mistakes, and to do bad stuff. You regret, and it seems as you really have had a bad rollercoaster, but sometimes that may make you even more humble.
ojala puedas grabar soy leyenda 2 esque me cag0 en todo es mi pelicula favorita y llevo muchos años esperando parte 2 :(
Nah the product placement lmao
Aaaaaaaaaggggghhhh.....
…. They don’t look at you the same no more Will, the damage is already done
I am so upset and my heart aches.  Will Smith, you are a page of my youth and always a proud star of mine.
I read your book and you're forgiven. Thanks for being u
Will, you are so valuable and necessary. I am positive that in time, Chris will forgive you and with his forgiveness, you can add that to the other things you treasure. Don't beat yourself up, you are not a piece of sh&*..You are a man who is fallible and unfortunately, that infallibility was on display for the world to see at the most inopportune time. You are a Man, not a Machine. Forgive yourself and to thine own self be true. God bless you.
This is really touching Will, I wasn't expecting something like this coming from you in that specific moment! I hope everything gonna be alright with Chris! Cheers brother!
Are they making you do an apology video ? Cause it looked real, but maybe you could have waited till after the show would have been a little more like a man to man., Or was this all planned?
sticking by Will regardless. Yes, it was not the time to do that, but if there were conversations that was a past history of disrespect, I get the reaction. You are still incredibly kind and a dynamic person!
“I reached out to Chris, and the message is he’s not ready to talk” - what was the point in saying that?!  Will S must have some terrible PR coaching…. That simple sentence detracts from all the subsequent statements of taking full accountability. The whole thing is just terribly composed. Will was a Titan, now can’t stand his drivel.
Dude you got a GOAT named after you now, things are looking up!
Will just saying I’m sorry is not enough.  You need to make amends.  Ask Chris how you can be of service.  He chooses an way you can be of service, like charity or some form of hard work.  Nothing demeaning to you but something uplifting to him.
Glad to see ur doing good Will. Can't wait for I AM LEGEND 2 !
Deeply remorseful without being ashamed…❤️ I support you Will.
I loveeeeeeee this… unless you are on your healing journey .. its harddddd  .. I’m proud of you will..
Business slow huh
He seems sincere. Kudos to you Will... cause that was a bad move on your part. Hopefully he can pull through now
Will, you're that dude for me. In THIS household you have nothing but fans. You made a mistake but no love was lost from your fans. It was a gray area. No one is perfect. We are all still learning. We love you Will, stay strong ❤️❤️
We all make mistakes, but don’t worry. You’ll get a second chance Will.
Will, you have always been an amazing role model.. THIS is just another opportunity to show the world how to handle and a navigate tough situations gracefully. Show the world that a setback is nothing but as setback....
Thanks for showing that men can be vulnerable, we all make mistakes and during that point we have to own up to our mistakes. Keep grinding 💪🏾💪🏾 brother, we have your back.
Brick by brick 😌 Day by Day ✨ this was very well said & genuine. I’m holding on😉👍🏾
Much respect for you
I think your highs more than outweigh your lows. However, i think your career is done by this point.
We all make mistakes Will, just stay prayed up.
Just leave that toxic woman and start over with your life
It’s never too late to do the right thing.
You did nothing wrong 🤷🏾‍♀️
Good on Will for making this video
Damn I use to like will 😞
Какой же обидчивый Крис что не готов говорить. Норм мужик просто пожали бы руки и забыли инцидент
❤️❤️ we love you Will
Proud of you. Many people don't like apologizing for their wrongdoings but in spite of being a huge name in  the Hollywood, you looked forward to this. This shows you're really a good man.
Will this is helpful not only for yourself but for those who are disappointed in themselves also.
Still love ya will.
A cojò, nn hai allentato qualche altro sganassone?
❤️❤️❤️ ALWAYS!
I love you Will Smith. You will always be my hero.
You wilding jit
We need a boxing 🥊 match unk 🫠
Feel bad for will good guy in a bad relationship
you had ONE mistake there are people that did way worse in the industry and didn't face consequences you are still a role model to us and that was shown when everyone came together to defend you from people trying to bring you down for ONE mistake in your whole career of being total perfection
No one cares
Cool Waluigi cap
C’est dingue la culpabilité et le remord ça ne le lâcheras jamais ..c’est maintenant qu’il se rend compte du mal qu’il a fait ..mais c’est fait
It's not irreparable Will.. it's forgiveable because of who you are and your track record.. you are and have been an example..
Никто не идеален, и этот поступок не затмит, того что ты сделал для миллионов, людей, ты один из самых любимых моих актёров, я вырос на твоих фильмов, мы тебя любим, со всей планеты люди тебя любят и ждут твоих фильмов
Celebrities are now making apology videos 💀
Do Better in the future. You are right you are human but your behavior was inexcusable period!!
Will.. please From one person with traumas/mental illness to another…bud, you did your best on this. You said you’re sorry, now move on with your life man. You are a fantastic man and representative of the black community. Keep hauling yourself up by your bootstraps, lean on your family, and know that this fan at least forgives and loves you.  We all make mistakes. It happens. Much love to you and yours. You got this!!!
Will its ok i love you and support you and im here for you
Sending hugs and love! I support you!
It's all good Will. Let's just move on from this BS. 🙏🏽
Will I give you a lot of credit for speaking up and being the man who stands up and takes responsibility for his actions and it takes a bigger man to make this right and that's exactly what you've done. No one has a right to judge you every single one of us makes mistakes and unless we're perfect and walk on water there is no reason one-so-ever for the hate you've gotten from so many from this situation and what's happened. I respect you and commend you for making our world a better place and knowing what you have to do to make this world a better place. We shouldn't be the ones punishing you, nor making you live in fear and pain you made a mistake and I know how much you regret it. Your a great man Will I have always thought so back before all this happened and  now and I always have and I always will. You have my support and forgiveness.
We love you will
We all forgive you will
I’m still a fan. We all make mistakes.
Look bro bottom line you messed up and everybody knows you did next move pick yourself up dust yourself off and keep on going There's only so much you can do if you keep living in the past
YOUR A G.O.A.T NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS
His own bottled water company being subliminally advertised in this video makes it entirely disingenuous
Good for you for doing this Will. I wish you the best of everything. Just keep working on yourself. We can all work to be better human beings. You are not alone.❤️
Missed you immensely Will! Glad you’re back and hope this launches the next step forward.
I guess when the money is cut off they start apologizing ur women is the problem.. Chris don’t buy this.
Did something wrong, a bad year, a terrible choice, things that happen in our lifes to any of us, don't worry, your friends know how you really are 💖, keep moving, searching and feeding the best of yourself!! 👍
I find no fault in what you've done.  Nobody can tell any man how to protect his family.  Sure some feel you may have had an opportunity to handle things with more tact however nobody is perfect.
Respect.
Wheres the dislike button 👎
As a libra and a child of the 90s I forgive u. U were clearly goin thru it. But no more smaks ok?
Will Smith it is good to see you and hear your voice. The sun will shine again!
Will!!! You are THE MAN...You have always put light and love and joy into the world. It sucks how 1 mistake automatically makes people forget the good person you are. I honestly believe that real friends and real fans don't automatically switch up and fault someone after just 1 mistake, no matter the magnitude. Also, real fans can forgive! Just watching your movies and the way you carry yourself automatically shows that the mistake that was made is not a normal thing. Keep your head up Fresh Prince! You got this!
I made Brisket and had a ice cold beer yesterday 🍻
I'm interested what books are on that back shelf.
You are human  Mr. Smith  thank you for sharing  this  it made me love you even more . ❤
Blessings on blessings to you!
This one mistake doesn’t define you just as the multitude of mistakes we all make doesn’t define us. EVERYONE is worthy of forgiveness, so forgive yourself! Spread your wings and soar again!
Everyone makes mistakes. He deserves his career back.
It's commendable that you're apologizing and seeking forgiveness, for that's the way to go in this case, let's hope Chris steps in soon and we can all leave this incident behind. The black community needs to be strong and unify.
We love you Will. You'll be back and even better.
Will Smith is a legend regardless of what happened
Hey. You fucked up. You know you did. You're owning this. Everyone fucks up. It's just usually in a more private fashion. Chris will come around eventually. You apologized sincerely. It may not be all good right now, but it will be. Everyone will be fine. You're not a bad guy. Just a good guy who did something below his usual standards. Hope you receive the forgiveness you're looking for soon and forgive yourself. Nobody died. It's all just a fun planet ride through the universe. Have a great day Will.
❤️❤️❤️❤️Will Smith ,still # 1️⃣ God Bless!!!
Good start, more to come.
I love you Will. ❤️
This was the right thing to do
Will smith what happennduhhh
Will I'm so happy you did this video you have been dearly  missed. We love you
You are a inspiring, and a real great man! When all that happened, i knew since day one, that was not you. We are all humans, we can all fall into the abyss, but climb up requires a real strength, and  i know for i fact that you are gonna come back. I wish you the best, with all my heart.
Beta male
We love you Will, no way we will let this destroy your career. Stay strong, King.
Good job bro.
W Apology
Love you Will. We all make mistakes. Ready to see what you got in store for the future.
Will is Human!!! Period!!!
dang willy, you're back? heading to your IG right now
Proud of u man
We love you Will smith ❤️
This isn’t the real Will Smith. If it was, the chair he’s sitting on would be slowly spinning.
Yeah chris gonna get you man
bravo will hope chris can reach out to you and get things into a better place   but is time to move on  and be better much love snd respect to you
Did you FiNd yourself in India? It’s a miracle Jada’s leash even stretches to another country yikes
Why did you do it?  It was so unnecessary .  It wasn’t a normal reaction at all and it leads me to believe that mentally you weren’t/aren’t in the best place.
Obviously Will was in the wrong, but Chris still refusing to talk to him three months later is kinda lame
As the framed picture on the wall says, "The world is sick and love is the cure." We love you Will.
Hearing the pain in his voice just  broke my heart 💔. You had a very human moment Will...  Much love from South Africa 🇿🇦 💞
He did the youtube apology sigh at the beginning lol
I wish you the best Will.  The main thing in my opinion (not that anyone cares but this is a comment section) is extending an olive branch to Chris and genuinely expressing remorse and humility about your actions and how they affected him.  Second, forgiving yourself and learning whatever lesson that you need to learn from this situation. Accept that Chris may never forgive you but some things are beyond our control.  Take full ownership of those things that are.
Here he is 😁 , good to have you  back will 💙💛
You are a amazing man, father and husband. You made a mistake but you are human and not a piece of $hit. Hold your head up high and keep shining.
Love You Will!!!🖤🖤🖤
Ya really buying this bs 😂 ya all clowns wit will
🥱 I’m going to the store anyone need anything?
I'm a sinner too, Will. Thanks for doing this and I wish you luck on your journey.
I'm not even mad at you.
You lie.. i mean what wrong with you? What next cussing in your songs . watch folks......He WORDS DON'T  match his Actions .
You're a good man Will and we love you!
Thank you for taking the time to do this video. Everyone makes mistakes nd it takes a big man to apologize for their conduct.
Has bad as it was he is only human I have seen people do worse and don’t get the back lash he has everyone should get over it it’s between Chris and will no one else so move along go live your own perfect life
I think he may be in a toxic relationship... glad he gets help though
Fair play Will. Always been a fan. I was kinda wondering how this would play out. As many others have said it’s so easy to make mistakes in this world, so very easy even to say or type the wrong message.   I truly hope that you and Chris sort out your differences and that we see you come back to life and once again appear on our screens.   I don’t normally pass comment on things like this but we are only here once and be it internationally famous or not, all deserve love and happiness.   Good luck 👍🙏
Still the GOAT
Apology accepted! Now let's move on to greater things.
Thank you for being honest. I have Aspergers and I know what it is like to have your brain not qork how you expect it to sometimes. Reacting inatead of responding. Owning your reaction and knowing it wasn't right is huge. I learned this: Pause, breathe, then respond mindfully. It's not always easy but is the way.
😂😂😂😂
I’m glade to see you again will truly
You had me at hello...
God gives grace and so do we. We love you Will!
Thank you for breaking silence.. we love it
LOVE YOU WILL ! 💗
If I was Chris I would need to catch a fade to resolve it. That would be my closure.
respect for you saying sorry and coming out with it. so it's just you and chris who have to talk <3   peace <3
Love you forever! 💕 Beautiful soul! Human and beautiful
This man inspired me so much to go towards my dreams
We love you uncle will
You are a good person. Everyone makes mistakes, you admit the mistake and are ready to take responsibility for it. Don't let this change you, don't let this change the way you see yourself. You are the kind of person the world needs right now.
Hes making an apology video like the youtubers 💀💀
This is a good step forward. I’m glad you had time to really clear your mind, look inward, and reflect. A lot of people deserve a second chance and I wish you the best in your career and future endeavors.
Much respect and love to you Will Smith!!
Hollywood at its best.... These people think they are living in one of their movies...
Can anyone explain why it took this joker 3 months to apologize?  This entire thing is a farce.
Never stopped loving you.
You're a class act even though you did something classless. You don't need anybody's forgiveness because no human on this Earth is perfect. I still have much love for you that never went away. Thank you for taking some time away to clear your head and do what it is that you need to do for your own sanity. People think it's easy being a celebrity and being in the spotlight so they have no idea how things affect you. Much love brotha 🙏🏾✊🏾
This is something that homelander would do after he did something bad
Love you Will, everyone makes mistakes, many worse than this. It was blown way out tbh
دز امها
The real reason you can’t understand why you did it and acted out of character is because SHE is pulling your strings buddy, get out before it’s to late
water bottle!!!!!!
I forgive you. U always come back, you always grow and you always do better
If you mean your apology, there’s absolutely nothing more you can do. It takes a man to admit his mistakes. It takes more than a man to change so it never happens again.  And I’m sorry we had to see that and sorry that you couldn’t help yourself then. Sometimes being shaken like you were makes one a better person. I wish you the best.
No one gets through this life without making mistakes and I am sure you have learned a lot through this process. I will always look up to you. Thank you for this sincere apology.
You admitted you were wrong.  It doesn't matter if Chris accepts or not, just move on.
Let's work together
I hope your apologize will be accepted by Chris, after all, you are friends
Wow I’m here a little early
This is great to hear him speak 🥰😇
I'm sorry for you, I don't think you did the right thing; however, you are a hurting man. You have not been treated the way a husband should be. I hope you are able to move past the pain, I care if you are ok.
well that is a good start.  You really don't owe us anything except that you want something from us.  respect. and that is a two way street.  Everyone has done idiotic things.  Me you and the whole crew.  This too shall pass.  Owning it is a stand up thing to do and certainly sets you on the right path to having that mutual respect.   I will forgive you and hope that others forgive me when I do stupid things.  If everyone knew everything everyone ever did that was disrespectful we would all be friendless.
I love you Will and that's never going to change... We all make mistake and I knew you felt the same feeling everyone else felt 100 times harder... Especially, because you're WILL SMITH ( Which I bet is heavy all by itself) I wish you the best and I'm sending mommy hugs your way Keep your head up baby
❤️ Will has done what a lot of people will not do and that is to sincerely apologize. That’s within his control and all he can do. It will either be accepted or it won’t but that’s out of his control. As he stated, he will wait with the hope of a conversation and also knowing it may not happen. And that on their part is also a choice. Can’t let your mistakes destroy you. Gotta keep living!  💪🏾
Cris Bey de siz de iyi insanlarsınız, kardeş kardeş geçinin ya hu. Hepimiz insanız Will Bey.
Yep this is a fake apology. If you are remorseful, then you should also feel ashamed because that worst feeling recognizes wrong doing.  But this weird apology video is out here because the checks stopped coming in.
You did not address the problem, It's an empty   staged apology.  You deserve better
Chris should apologize as well tbh
Too little too late tbh
In a world where so many people in the public eye ignore their questionable actions and behaviors until the masses forget about it and then they pretend it never happened, I very much appreciate that you are addressing this in a humble and apologetic way.
Right on WILL! WE ALL MAKES MISTAKES. ALL YOU CAN DO IS APOLOGIZE AND BE BETTER + MOVE ON. #SALUTE
We love you bro 🇹🇿🇹🇿❤️❤️❤️we’re all make mistakes but apologies is the strongest winning soul
WE FORGIVE YOU WILL AND WE LOVE YOU. WE ARE BADBOYS4LIFE
I can’t take an apology seriously when someone’s wearing a baseball hat.
We all make mistakes & no one is perfect. He shouldn’t be damned for the rest of his life for this
Will you need to leave that leech of a woman brother she will be your downfall....
Your kids condoned it n what you did is really not acceptable I mean koddos to you for thus video but I'm sorry will even I can't forgive that but I wish u well ind future
Get that checkbook ready, m’fer
Will, Jesus is the only way to find true peace. I hope someone comes into your life who can help you find your way to Him.
This would have been a non-issue if you just waited till it was over and fought like men away from the ceremony. You won’t read this but I pray you find healing.
Chris doesn’t have to reach out to you EVER. Your glow is gone sir.
Forgiveness is a very powerful lesson for all of us to learn. We are all players on the stage of life. Constantly learning and  growing. It takes courage to admit when your wrong and even more courage to try to change and grow from it.
I love you, I understand that you are human, I still support you. ❤️
Jadas to blame for everything that’s happening to him
I like Will. I've always liked Will. I think he is sincere and I applaud him for this. We all mess up sometimes and it takes a big person to "own up". Many wouldn't do it.
Comedians have no place to be a presenter at Awards Ceremonies
You've always been someone who I looked at as having a good heart. I still have a lot of respect for how you made peace with Janet Hubert and showed her proper respect for being your elder. And I think good heart of yours will always be with you.
I remember when I first saw Will Smith had  a YouTube channel, I thought he isn’t a YouTuber now with this apology I believe he is
I can't believe the almighty Will Smith is making a Youtuber apology video. What a world...
I hope anyone who cast stones is perfect and never made a mistake in life… what happened to human empathy? This man is genuinely sorry and I respect him a lot for his courage to do this video. We love you Will 💙
Don't do it again! Sending you lots of love.
You deserve to forgive yourself for it all. We're all human and prone to making mistakes. The thing that becomes a burden for us as humans in our mistake is the weight of shame and feeling as though we're a  disappointment to those that look up to us. That weight is something we can choose to release or hold on to. Either way we live with it, no one else. Forgive yourself and recognize and appreciate your human nature. You can't fall when you're grounded. The biggest lesson in this has to be that you've now been able to show us that we are human. Thank you for being you! 🌻💫
You’re a good man and we still love you. We are all human and do all have our down moments. Thank you for this. You’re still all that and appreciate you and all you have been and still are to be.  Keep your head up ! ❤️
Good to see you again. Love you regardless man!
Blink twice if you are in danger Will
Much love to you bro ❤️🙏🏽
Oh boy, here we go.
Will simpith
I certainly appreciate the words you have said today. The sad thing ultimately is the legacy of Will smith and this moment that will follow you forever  . The fact that you ruined the greatest professional achievement of your life , will be  very difficult to ever live down. Any look at your life will tragically  always include this moment. I hope you can find healing in your life .
Crazy how this man has been perfect his entire career and one little incident makes everyone feel some type of way, forget all that will all the real fans know how you really are and we still rooting for you
Good Luck Mr. Smith! Take care of your self and your family ;) best from Norway
Love you ❤️❤️ Proud that you took the time to apologize repeatedly. One mistake doesn’t tarnish your character.
L-Will
This would feel a lot more genuine if he didn't do it on a carefully crafted set with lighting and a whole crew behind the camera.
Você é foda Will, como você diz "errar é humano" e ser humano é reconhecer nossos erros. Paz no seu coração Will e de toda a sua família.
Idc what anyone says, you’re an honerable man.
Never thought we’d get to point in history where Will Smith is unironically posting a YouTube apology video
Simply put you made a mistake you apologized and that's more than I get from a lot of people I respect you I admire you and I enjoy your work. I wish you the best and I admire you for protecting people you love
its rewind time!
He's not a role model, he's a celebrity with too much money and not enough people telling him no so that when his ego gets bruised he justifies acting like a child. Stop glorifying people who aren't real role models just because they have influence
Too late sadly, you embarrassed him...
I believe you will … that man pride is a muthafvka
HI! WILL - Welcome Back - Glad you are continue on with your healing journey. I support you all the way.
We all get caught up in the heat of the moment, but yours was magnified on such a big stage, you will always be one of the GOATs, not many people will ever know what it’s like to walk in your shoes, but everyone for the last 30 years wishes they could.
The damage is done, you've shown youre real colours.
I know It's better late than never but it took you four month to realize you made a mistake🤔
We love ya big will
Honestly everyone makes mistakes.  Can we move on? The public has forgiven you, we can prove it with your next movie. But clearly the mainstream media is out to get you.  Don't let them.
Awh it’s rewind time
Will🐐👑
Aww💘 I wanna Hug Him and tell him everything is gonna be Okay!
Growth isn't linear.
we still Love bro bro. You will bounce back.
You took accountability, something most people can't do. You did what you thought was right. But don't worry, I'm positive everything will be alright
After water to cave.. too late bud
Get divorce please
We still love and look up to you dearly ! Maybe even more now than ever,  We ALL Make mistakes .
Love u Will, you still a legend, take your time to heal and be safe!
Time, introspection, and persistence will be your best friends, Will. You've been severely humbled, something we all need once in a while. People won't forget anytime soon and that's understandable. But if you truly come out of this a better person and people still won't forgive, that's on them.
Love ya buddy 🙏 everything will be ok
I LOVE WILL SOO MUCH AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS!! we all mess up move on people.
Too late. You should have done that the night of your breakdown.
Looks like someone is trying to safe his career...😅
That was a great "Stand up Apology" I salute you Mr. Smith for the message you are conveying to your Family, Friends and fans all over the world. And my take away from this is Let's not judge but weigh in on one's integrity to say with sincerity I was wrong and will not stop and will continue to do what I have to do to bring a balance of peace amongst us once again.
Will you have had a stellar career free of any drama and i hate that ONE slip up has lead to this kind of backlash.   I think your written apology was more than enough.   I think you’re being too hard on yourself and hope that you can heal from this.   Thanks for all that you have given the world. Don’t let this singular moment define your life or your career.
Why did it take 4 months to realize you needed to publicly apologize tho? There was a lot of doubling down happening there
Will you will always be loved. Thank you for being a stand up man and acknowledging your wrong doing and apologizing to Chris. Keep your head up
It's too late man... It's too late.
Pride comes before the fall
You made a mistake the world saw. But you are a stand up guy!!! I will  always love you Will. Apology  ACCEPTED.  ❤️ 💙 💜 💖 💗
It’s about time. Time to move on.
You will probably never see this, but you have some serious issues, i don't know what you have going on and don't really care to know because we will have stuff going on.... You used to be the guy, and unfortunately in alot of peoples eyes you aren't anymore, i don't know how you can buy that respect back so to speak but first step is fixing the issues you have... And just saying when jim Carey said "spineless at mass" he was correct ,it was spineless...
We all make mistakes. We will still love you no matter what 💕
You need to find the route of your anger or things will never change. Understand that route may end up being something or someone that you love.
You are human man. We all make mistakes. People should not be judged solely by their failures. How or what they do in the face of their failures should also be considered. That is what defines us. I am a life long fan and keep living by and listening to your heart. That's all that matters.
Wow! Thank you for putting yourself out there in such a vulnerable way to try and make amends for your mistake. Many of us who look up to you realize you are still human & imperfect at the end of the day. The good you've put into the world far outweighs the bad so keep your head up & don't let this one incident define who you are as a person. We still got your back Will! 💪🏾❤  You made a mistake but you are not a disappointment. Hold on to your light, love, & good hearted nature. That's what makes you the best!!
lets move on. you made a mistake, you did what you thought, at the time, was right. Since then, you had time to think and realize that it wasnt a good idea. we all sometimes do things in the heat of a moment that turned out to be a bad idea. we stand up for what we did and then learn from it.  Stop beating yourself up. We are still here and love you! you brought so many ppl joy and entertainment, i think we are able to forgive and still be friends :)
I swear i just remeber that day and searched on YouTube your name and found this video after les than 1 hr from uploding!
We all make mistakes will it’s what we learn from them mistake that makes us the person we want to be, I believe in you I support you and will always follow you keep your chin up
You are a good man, Will
You're a public person adored by many and made a mistake. At the end of the day you should live upto your own standards and I think you consider yourself good person. You let yourself down and noone else should matter when it comes to letting people down.  Lesson learned, trying to be better is all you can do. Apologise which you did and give time so your friends may forgive you and I hope that's the case.
Introspection is a key factor in developing your Emotional Quotient (EQ). I admire anyone that takes the time to realize they're not emotionally perfect and works to better understand why and how they can improve this. This will lead to great personal growth and I hope all those involved in this mess can bring themselves to forgive Will. It will lead to growth for them too. To Err is human. To forgive is Divine.
One mistake don’t change the man you are, I’m still a fan and can’t wait to see more of your work
Love you still.💯💛
Do not beat yourself up too much. You are human. Even coming here to openly apologize is a huge deal. People need grace to be people.
Gay
Bro, you weren't even wrong.
After this 5 minute apology video I’d say all is forgiven and forgotten right guys
Will, we love you so much. You are a great man and outstanding actor and person. I always say, Will Smith should be the President of the World. Just know, that people love you and their love is over all that things. You did what you had to. You apologized,  it's enough. My heart is always with you. Thank you for all you say and for your art and creation. We support you
Glad ur career over Willy bye bye
Crazy to see such a larger than life and positive person seem so broken inside. We’re all just humans at the end of the day. Hope Will can move on from what’s eating away at him.
I miss who you were before your marital and family problems consumed you. Can you get in touch with that Will again? 🙏
people do mistakes. that´s what it is all about... If they realize their mistakes and apologize, I think it´s absolutely all right. Worst thing is when the person will not realize that and will not apologize...
All about time….glad Chris is sitting back and reflecting on this and being so mature about this.
❤
I don’t know what else people would like to hear to forgive / forget this moment .. he said sorry, he truly feels sorry, that’s it! We all do mistakes! There is really bad people out there, let’s focus on this .. yes this wasn’t ok, that’s never the right answer for a bad feeling, but he knows, we know and that’s it! I will support him because he reflects hisself, he took his time and to go in public and apologize is a big thing!
Thank you for doing this. You need to heal and move on and apologize to Chris when he's ready. You have had over 3 decades of excellence and to have one moment of character flaw is what makes you human. So heal and move on. Keep doing the work. Be your authentic self and keep on shining! We love you Will. We are here for you when you're ready!
Will what a way to take accountability for your actions by being a stand up guy that you've always been by apologizing. None of us are perfect & folks should not throw stones at you because we all live in a glass house. The Lord always perfects the things that concern us & I believe that you are on the right track as His redemptive power is unmatched. You've done your part. Now in due time others will have to release the spirit of offense & forgive as well.
I love you Will… We are all human. We love you. Respectable man!!! It takes a real man to do this. We can not all be perfect…
Imagine living 30+ years in the spotlight not getting into an once of trouble, seemingly being the perfect guy and the one time you slip up people are ready to end you in a heartbeat. I'm not saying what he did was right but damn let's not act like he's the devil now also. You're good Will you still got my respect let's grow from this and MOVE THE HELL ON AND THATS FOR EVERYONE
The lightball behind him and the white hat mixed together is very distracted...
creo que esto es una prueba de que will es humano y se puede equivocar ,pero solo una persona grande lo acepta y pide disculpas, eso te hace mas grande estoy seguro que chris rick aceptara las disculpas
정말 잘 풀리길 바랍니다 그리고 와이프랑은 이혼해요...
We Love you Will and it's self accountability on both sides !!
while I can appreciate the acknowledgement of your actions that night, I think (hope) you're being sincere - not because of the backlash, but because you're truly sorry. Blur or not, the world saw you laugh at first, then run on stage and strike another human. It was a shitty thing to do, but you shouldn't make you feel shitty forever. Hope you get the help you need.
Omg love him so much. This made me 😢. We are with you Will
Thanks once again for being authentic and vulnerable. I bought your book just a few months before this incident and it was as if you were explaining how something like this could happen long before it actually did. Those capable of growth will continue to ride out with you brother. Keep giving us the real.
Will we love you! We all make mistakes. We all have been hurt and have hurt in some way or another. So glad that you did this. It shows what we know you have; character! God's grace is sufficient and I pray that for you. Please go in peace and let's get this fantastic journey get started again! Apology accepted!
We all make mistakes, we grow from them and all your real fans have your back and we know all the good you put out in the world. We love you!
Sell out 🤣
Well Said Unc!
Your still one of the most inspiring actors one of my favorite actors got all of my respect Will!
Be kind to yourself Will the words are coming out buy your eyes say that you are broken. Love yourself first please sir
💐 for both Will & Chris, 2x 🐐 's.
Apology accepted, You are a loving and inspiring man. Some people aren't going to accept you back and that's okay. Keep moving forward with confidence and your bubbly personality. Welcome Back!!!
Nothing but ❤ for you! We learn from our mistakes! ❤
It feels so good to have you back. I am happy to hear that you're not shaming yourself. You made a mistake, you're human. People who genuinely love you will understand that. You are such a beacon of light, sending you and everyone involved lots of love and peace. 💛
Omg new YouTube apology video just dropped.
Will I have loved you and your work for years! I watched you when I was much younger and if your name was in the credits I would watch the movie ! If your name is associated with something I would see or read it! Nothing has changed! I still love you and your work! I still respect you as an artist and a man! I appreciate the strength it took to come on and make a very serious apology to alll that may have been impacted by your mistake. That is a good lesson for others! You get knocked down but you get up again. Nobody is going to keep you down,,, nor should they try! Let him who is without sin cast the first stone! If you ever were a friend to this man ask yourself if you think you’re in a position to cast a stone at him! What he did was wrong and he acknowledges that! All he can be is sorry and do better. All he can do is try to mend fences! Let us let him before it is us who needs forgiveness and no one is willing to forgive us!!
'Its Rewind Time'
My man, it’s all good. I know why. Of course it’s not the right choice,but I understand you are human like everyone else. Other celebs did way worse than that. Still a big fan and look forward to your next projects.
You've been my fave since I was a youngin. I appreciate your honesty and still support you.
Will,   You got into one little fight, and the world got scared.... 😊  We own it, apologize, learn and move forward. Still rockin' wit you man.
4:13 i understand this. but this is what makes you a tool. you will let someone use you in such a way. i mean... they will make you feel so bad about yourself that it breaks you and youll do anything for their acceptance. they are not loving you... they are manipulating you. i admire taking all the blame yourself but we arnt dumb enough to be blind to the toxicity behind those closed doors.
I’d like to talk to you in person. I’m in LA and work on Melrose.  I am the bottom  I am the last  I am the despised  But  I am the highest  I am the first  I am love  I am  And I am that I am  If your willing to see the depths  I can show you a thing   B
Will im on your side chris knew she had a medical problem and Chris got what he deserved
Will we have missed you and your videos. I think media did too big of a thing of incident.
America going into recession.  Meanwhile Will Smith….I’m sorry…  Just move on. There’s bigger fish to fry right now or release I am legend 2
Everyone makes mistakes,I make them daily.We are human....  but when I make mistake I know it and I apologise. It does not take months to do this...
I hope you find peace. You look like someone in a lot of pain.
This was a great apology that doesn’t try to make excuses. Regardless of how Will felt about Chris and their past experiences, he acknowledges the way he handled himself on stage was wrong.   I remember there were some people trying to defend Will, and trying to say he was defending his wife’s honor by doing what he did. Truth is, there’s other ways of expressing your discontent. And Will knows this.   At the end of the day, we are all human. He made a mistake, and he has learned from it and apologized to all affected parties. This is how a role model should handle something like this.   Good job Will.
Nah, you should be ashamed of yourself.
It wasn’t great what you did but who hasn’t made a mistake which they later regret.  Yours was just very public.  What you can be proud of is this video, it takes a lot of guts to publicly admit you were wrong and not try to sweep it under the carpet.  And who knows maybe you will do more good by making others examine their choices,
We Love you Will, Nobody's perfect.....❤️
I accept your apology. I accept your humanity. Grace to you, my friend.
He acted his worst moment at his highest peak. That's going to haunt him forever, worse than any memes etc.
As a fan and as a person who roots for Black Excellence, I am rooting for you. This video took great courage and I thank you for posting it. May you find the peace, joy and equilibrium that you seek.
You're only human. I love you
Great that he found the time to do this after his round of golf!
I don't want to repeat anything already said but just know will man you've always been and will always be my role model. Thank you for everything you've done. And to everyone else man if Noone else has said I appreciate all the love in the comments and to all that see this love bruvs and sisters 🖤🖤
You messed up, learn from it and move on, we all make mistakes.
A truly genuine apology, you love to see it
You are still my favorite artist period
You didn’t disappoint me Will. I admire you even more; I saw you as a human. After following up your career, read your book, admired you in your ups, knowing all you have worked on your personal growth, all that you’ve put into becoming your better self, here I still am in your bad too. I’m sure all the real ones still are, because we empathize with you and know we’re all humans. We all make mistakes, the difference is we don’t all have the world looking at us and ready to create an opinion about our actions.💓❤️
That one action doesn’t define you. You are a great man
We’ll always love you Will!
WE ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY!!!
God bless you and your family! Hope all involve heal!🙏🏾💚
Glad you’re doing better Will.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you WILL.
You did the right thing
No more Simpin Will
Come on back Will. We all make mistakes.
you already apologized for more brother ball forward now it's time to go back to do what you do best! 💪🇧🇷
Don't worry will you're not giving to your son he himself giving it to him
He claims their is no part of him that believes what he did was acceptable and yet he did it.  Actions are louder than words…If you believed what you are saying, then you would never had done it.
I'm not gonna lie, you let me down big time as I love both you and Chris, but who am I to judge, at the end of the day you are human
Thanks Will. Just like you said, we're all human.
Clearly there IS "part of you" that felt acting that way was ok ...because you did it! Still rooting for you though, and to be honest, it's really not that big of a deal when something like this happens between family / brothers!!
Love you Will
Before the trolls pretend like there's no thing as forgiveness or mental fragility I still want to say this man is still an idol and has a large positive impact on me personally.  It can happen to anyone on the wrong day.  That was a wrong day.
Total d-bag move, should be suspended for life from the Academy. Blacklist him. Disgusting behavior! He’s put so many comedians lives in danger with his actions.
Bro is talking as if he's reading off of a script
When is iRobot 2 coming out my brother let's get back to work@willsmith
We all have made in the heat of the moment decisions but I feel like that moment, DOES NOT DEFINE YOU!!!I still look up to you because that moment doesn't out weigh ALL the good works you've done! You said it best when you said you're human. I love you Will! Now can you get back in the studio?! This generation needs some more music!!!
I’ll always love you will, your a Legend people make mistakes we are human!!!!
.
a lot of love ❤️ people make mistakes thats wy we are human
Stay strong will 💙
takes a big man to do something wrong publicly. takes an even bigger of a man to speak out about it.
Respect for owning up to your mistake
Keep healing will , We are all just constantly healing and the only way to do this is to make wrong decisions along the way ! Will fans are here ! Let’s goooo 🐐👏🏼
Completely Neutral to this whole thing, it barely registered to me when it happened and I only really learnt the whole story today prior to this video going up. This was the right and noble thing to do, my absolute respect for choosing to do this.
Love you Will, everyone makes mistakes it makes us human. You will always be the GOAT in my opinion. Much love to you and yours and Chris' family as well.
What do you say to Tiffany Haddish who told every young black men, now that’s how you gain black women’s respect.
Why to apologize for protecting someone you love?!!?. I know that your career depends on it but some things are more holy than a career.
No one is perfect we all deal with a lot we forever in the process of growing and finding ourselves and continue to grow Will Smith you are an inspiration too many to not give up no matter how much Life beats you down.
It takes a strong person to admit their mistakes. Fair play Will 👏🏾
I still love you Will and I will continue to pray for you. 🙏🏾🙏🏾
❤️
It’s gonna be okay & know that the “heart felt” apology was needed & not for urself but for YOURSELF. Continue to reach put to Mr Denzel for mentorship.   Be blessed♥️🙏🏾
still my fav actor, we all have bad times. yours are just in the limelight.
The media will have their way with this video. But I want to thank you for your transparency. Nothing but love for you in your growth, Uncle Will 🖤
I lost all respect for this man
I don’t think you have anything to be sorry about. Chris got what’s been coming to him for years
Love you Will ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We all have really bad moments in our life, it's when the bad moments become's our "Whole Life", thats where we get stuck and can't move forward. Thank you for doing this video. The Healing has begun. 1000 Hugs
I love you, Will. It's okay. We all make mistakes 💙💕
You are an amazing person ❤️ you are only human ❤️ sending so much love and prayers ❤️  you are loved and respected it ❤️
Its okay pal everyone do some dumbshits. Glad to see you are apologising for what you did. All be good buddy
The lamp behind him was distracting…  Nonetheless, Will is human. We ALL make mistakes. Hopefully Chris reaches out and put this to rest.
We have all made reactive choices instead of responsive ones in our worst moments.  I was ashamed  for a while about this but then i had to remind myself that we are all human. The only thing that matters is how you choose to respond afterward. Will, you always have been a huge part of the lives of myself and so many others. Infectious smiles laughs and good heartedness. You have always set the respect bar high for everyone else, which is why there was so much shock and awe. However we are all family, we are all friends. Im proud of you whole heartedly for taking accountability and responding this time and letting us know the reaction was not a reflection of who you really are.
Yeah, Mr. Smith you gotta apologize to yourself for the profanity you used in your language and for not having a sense of humor. .
Very well done Big Willie. Martin Luther also made mistakes but it doesn't change his life work and dedication. Luv ya bra
Hi Will. Before I take a look at this. I want to say. I love the movie "Richard King". I understand we all go through it as human beings .but you need to know from me Sir. You are Loved. Not that corny Love everyone tries to say when they want to score points from someone. But, Loved profoundly. Yes, like everyone else I was shocked. But, I took time to assess what happened. I want you to know I choose to not be astute. I've made many impulsive decisions in my life. You said one key word to me. Protect! That was enough for me. I will now proceed to hear what you got to convey. Respect Sir.! Enjoy the rest of your summer. You got this!
💯💯💯💯
Don't cry Will please bro
why apologise now its abit too late, never let a women dictate yo life, wherever its physical, emotional or social. be a man and run tings, we run tings, tings nuh run we!!!
Remorse without shame... that right there.. we all do things that can cause us to feel this way. I am glad you are choosing to move forward and not focus on staying in your trauma. Love you Will!
Will said, "I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself". Being ashamed is part of being remorseful. That's how you get to the feeling of remorsefulness. If you're not ashamed there is no remorsefulness. That being said, You are human and WE ALL make mistakes. Pick yourself up, adjust your pants and move on. Those relationships that were damaged can be mended. The kicker is, It's not just your choice alone if they (relationships) continue. It takes one person to destroy a relationship, it takes 2 people to make it work.
this was the kind of response I was hoping you'd give. not to satisfy me, cuz who tf am I? but to display what I believe is the right way to manage a wrong turn. I support you acknowledging your wrong without being ashamed.   still rocking with you Will. ❤️
I'm sorry you are going through this. The bad choices we make in a moment of our life only sticks with GOOD PEOPLE because it's so hard to forgive ourselves for it. You are a good person brother. I pray for you and your family as well as Chris and his. Work on forgiving yourself. Others won't forgive you until they are ready. And they may never be ready. You have no control over thaf. And that's ok. Learn from this experience and Live your life because it is a beautiful one.
I’m glad to see your face again, Mr. Smith. ❤️
We've missed you my gee
I want to apologize for the world’s reaction they hold the “celebrity” to a higher standard….they forget you are a human being too & we are all flawed. 💯🙏🏽💗 You always been one to try make this world a better place.
We all will get through this Will.I'm praying for you.❤️
Now that he said this. I hope it's over. Respect to Will.
I'm happy you decided to talk about this and say sorry. It was a poor decicion when it happend but good on you for talking about it like this.
Celebrity boxing match????
Love you
This must a nightmare for Will's PR team
Will, bro, we forgave you the day after it happened.
All I wanna say to you be careful with Jeda, she is holding you down!
Love you Will
So I'm guessing you have come to realize that life is made up of opportunities for growth and understanding. We have to sometimes bottom out before we realize change is necessary. I've always admired you. I know that you will learn the appropriate lesson or lessons from this. Love ya man!
I love you Will. We all make mistakes. They don’t define you. Looking forward to the next chapter brother.
I accept your apology Will.
We love you, we support you.. Thanks for the clip
To late
We love you
You’re one of my favourite actors  mr will smith, a huge inspiration  Thank you
kind of late for this PR shxt. Probably got a movie coming out lmao
Hey Will.  Thanks for doing your work on this.  Healing starts with study and awareness.  This moment does not define you.  No matter who tries to make it so.  Be gentle with yourself sir. Sending you strength.  💓
It's all good man.  No one is perfect and we all make mistakes sometimes.
I know media will twist this in all sorts of ways but I think this is the right way to apologize and sincerely. I am still with you.
You was wrong you need to make peace with Chris. You can’t undo it but learn and move forward one step as a time
It’s too far unforgettable    I hate you know was a big fun.      It sound the you need money !!! It’s terrible what you did
Took months to do makes it meaningless.
You still our guy Will 🐐
You notice you not making no money so now you listing to what ppl was saying
It’s all good will you human bro ..Chris Ard
Damn I'm here at nearly 16k views...
lol dude .. you did good...
Man’s has done so much for people and 1 stupid mistake…smh. We stand with you will!!
I love you, respect you, and consider you a wonderful person. Thank you for taking time to talk about. Been there and believe me I understand!
Thank You for this Will! No one perfect . Forgiveness is real 💜  Not to be carried but to be unloaded!! Love You
Will.. You're Still An Inspiration To More People Than You Think! We're All Human & We All Fall Short Of The Mark, BUT We Must Keep Pushing Forward With Our Genuine Purpose No Matter How Many Times We Fall. PEACE & BLESSINGS To You & The Fam!! STAY FOCUSED!! This Is Just Another Chapter In Your Life's Story... It's Not Over Yet!
I appreciate your apology. I hope everything gets cleared up.
We all make mistakes. We’re not perfect. It’s how the person handles it in the end. Communication, showing transparency, you’re a strong one for that 💪🏽
WE LOVE YOU!! IT is OKAY and it will be OKAY, we are human! Try not to be so hard on yourself! It was so good to see you, LOOKING GOOD! Praying for your continued strength for your spirit, soul and body! May the JOY of the LORD be your strength! YOU GOT THIS! (big HUG) Much love to you! <3 Kelly Marie
People just need to move on...this was not that big of a deal
Your are one of the greatest actors of time, your interview shows true emotions that you are feeling after this incident, absolutely admirable, if grown up with you on screen and this solidifies you a hero in my eyes
why record it and in such a well lit dramatic way
Feels fake, all the camera angles and cuts just make it seem like a PR video
You are making a bigger deal over this than it is Stop mimicking your wife's pretentious behavior
So very obvious that each word is forced. Will Smith is reacting and only posting this video months later because he’s become untouchable in the industry. Come on, he committed a crime.
Q vuelva a hacer el principe del rap q es lo unico bueno q hizo en la vida
We love you, Will. There is no love lost! You’ve been a standup guy throughout your entire Hollywood career and one controversial incident does not change that. You’ve positively impacted more lives than you’ve hurt. Never forget that. You have our support during your journey of becoming an even better man. ✊🏾💯
Will your my man's 💯 nothing has changed brotha!!!I know you regret how it happened and we all have lapse in judgment at times Stay Blessed bro🙏🏿(Always a Supporter since 1990)
Thanks, Will! I'm make sure to wait half a year to apologize to anyone
انا بحبك يعمي
Thanks W. That’s all you can do.
Takes a big man to apologize but we are all human and sometimes we make mistakes in the worst moments but that's a part of life and the journey
Треш, конечно. Он его жену обстебал, которая вроде больна, и в итоге перед ним извиняется, что за нее вступился. А в кино такие крутые все, всех раскидывают. "Плохие парни"...
Will, as you do the work of forgiveness, please give yourself some grace.   Some of us understood the sentiment behind the action.   GRACE AND MERCY...They that WAIT on THE LORD SHALL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH AND MOUNT UP WITH WINGS AS EAGLES  SHALL WALK AMD NOT GET WEARY, RUN AND NOT FAINT.
Hey Will. You are only Human. It takes a real man to come forth like you did in this video to apologize and attempt to explain.  I remain a huge fan! This to shall pass.
Great acting dude, only gullible people will believe this apology.
It takes a big man to admit he was wrong. I hope you and Chris can make amends. As bad as your action was Chris is not completely innocent in this. His comment was disrespectful and maybe even hurtful to others and should not have been said. I also hope you take this as a closure apology and move on. Others may be expecting you to apologize every time you talk to them but this should be the last one. I wish you, your family, Chris and his family all the best.
We know *Hollywierd* is a place that's *unreality.* You're just a man. I respect your openness, exceptance, and repentance. Straight ahead --->🙏
I missed you Willie🥰🤗
Sad to say but There are just somethings an apology can't fix
just saying "apologize" to chris or chris mother isn't apology .. but you said sorry to jade and your kids is whole different on just saying "I would like to apologize to chris"
Always taught my boys u do something wrong be a man apologise. U never know how much u hurt someone.
The weight of the world is heavy, when Chris is ready to talk, we'll all be watching
I understand the mistake he made. I once did something that I couldn’t explain. It felt like an out of body experience when I looked back on it. I still can’t explain why I made the decision I made.
Will ...things happen and other things happen. It's the end of the world and this too shall pass.  Disappointment is part of life and as long as YOU have lived up to your own image by apologizing then don't be ashamed or embarrassed by anyone or anything. Keep smiling man.
It’s all good Will. We all mess up, everyone is human. In your role it’s tough remember that for others. But with great power there is great responsibility.
It really has been a minute, great to hear from you.
Peace king.
Best apology is to 1. Divorce from that Jezebel you married. 2. Leave all media for atleast 3 years.
So glad to see will.
Welcome back!
Powerful
I don’t know how anyone could stay mad at will after this. This was a perfect response imo
Love you, Will!!!
It takes a big man to admit his faults and an even bigger man to own up to his mistakes. I commend you Mr. Smith on the bravery you showed to even make this video. I imagine it couldn't have been easy. Mistakes is an inherent part of what it means to be human. There is no one who hasn't done something they've regretted. Perfection is a fantasy that no one can live up to. I just hope that everyone can accept your sincere apology and finally find some forgiveness and move on. I hope that after this, you and your family will find some peace.
Love you will,Chris and those other sensitive easily triggered snowflakes will be OK!
I don’t buy it, I know I don’t have to, but I don’t.
Bro glad to see you back bruh. Folks do things in the spur of the moment.  After this let's get back to inspiring folks a making epic content.  I've done stupider things in my own life. You are human being.  Let's go!!!
nah
We all get it, everyone has had a bad day and lashed out in one form or another, the only diff if you’re famous and they(Media etc) decided to drag you and your family through the Mudd. It’s sucks, especially for Celebrities cause they get it worse than anyone else in the planet. Me, I’m still here brother and looking forward to Will Smith 2.0.
You're human Will. You made one mistake in your long amazing career. Don't be so hard on yourself. We still love you!
nice acting!
We all fall…we all mess up…only difference is that this mess up was on a world stage. It’s no different though than any of our own failings that we experience on a daily basis. All we can do is ask for forgiveness, pick ourselves up, learn from that experience and move on. Good to see you back out there, Will. Prayers and love for you!
We are all humans and make mistakes. No one is perfect. I respect you as a man and your actions will not make me love you any less. Always a fan!!! Keep working on yourself. 🙏💕
You've made a mistake, its okay. You've been through a lot and you've always been positive and smiling. You have a big heart and always helped people. You've always been a good person Will
If Chris is "not ready to talk," keep that to yourself. Glad you're getting help and doing the work.
Took that long to come up with this? A softball FAQ
Isn't I AM LEGEND 2 coming out this year? I hope this isn't the only reason this video came out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We all make bad mistakes every now and again.....but it takes a lot to come forward and admit it and say sorry! all the best to you!
I don’t think you did anything wrong. Can’t wait for your next project
This feels genuine. I hope you and Chris can reconcile. Tough
I Love me some Will Smith. We all make mistakes being a young person and being an adult. It is truly profound to take full accountability for your actions and I applaud your stance in this matter.  I am deeply saddened by the choice that you made on how you reacted,but sometimes, ppl really need watch what they say out of their mouths and be mindful of others as well.  You DID NOT let me down and nor is your image tanished in my eyes. We all have fell short of His Glory...You are a beautiful soul and you will be just fine. You have brought me joy since your 1st album and now in the present day. You are a BRILLIANT ACTOR, RAPPER, PRODUCER, COMEDIAN (at times) and believe me, THIS TOO SHALL PASS...I thank you for your honesty,  transparency and solitude. You are and will always my favorite triple threat;
Listen, we all mess up and make mistakes..its called being human. You did the right thing by laying low after that night to take time to rethink some things. You'll bounce back soon enough. Again...everyone of us has done something we regret.
Wow all this proves is Will Smith is human just like the rest of us & makes mistakes and bad choices just like everyone else.
So much vulnerability and honesty. We love you Will! 🖤🖤🖤
Must have been Hard foe ya since that day. You will always he the Fresh Prince Will
Aye Will - you didn't let me down brotha. I read your book and I understand where it came from. Keep growing beloved. You're doing what many of us are too afraid to do and thats taking the road of self development and living our TRUEST FORM. In that - many things will happen. Keep fighting champ. I love you King.
Sending positive vibes and prayers to you.
Will smith is fake af!! I don’t believe a but of this!!! Homeboy just needs some more work!!
Hi Will, you made a mistake. We all have and many will continue to make mistakes.  We are human and mistakes are inherently apart of our DNA.  You have offered and provided your apologies.  Move on and continue to strive to be the best person you can. Look to please God and follow the steps that he has ordered for you. Many may not forgive you or forgot what you have done. God forgives and allows us to move past our mistakes. Love you!!
Go Will go!
It was 84 years ago man
You're human, we all make choices we wish we could take back and we know that's not always possible, but what we can do is learn and grow, so, learn and grow.
One of my favorite male actors of all time. I have been watching you since fresh prince. We all make mistakes. Who are we to judge! Only God can judge and we are thankful for his MERCY and FAITHFULNESS 😁Will you still have fans that ❤️ you. Peace be with you ❤️❤️
I just want that u and Chris come together! Love from germany
Great acting
You are simply outstanding, and incredibly respectable for this.
I always admired you growing up. Now I just can’t bare to hear you or see you the disappointment from your actions and the way you have condoned yourself afterwards seems unforgivable. So very disappointing
Your fans are here for you, have been here for you, and will always be here for you. Who cares what those wishy-washy, fake Hollywood folks think! They will turn on you one minute, and kiss the ground you walk on in another.  We're all human, we all have emotions, and we ALL make mistakes, but what also is true is that we ALL can redeem ourselves and grow through it all. You will be back on top soon!
I love you❤️
Will, Te perdonamos, me gustó como reflexionaste tu error y te discúlpaste con la familia de Chris, Haremos que la academia te perdone también, y vuelva a la alfombra roja a la persona que nos hizo bailar, nos hizo reír, y nos hizo llorar, un abrazo
He who is without sin, cast the first stone. Redemption is a cornerstone of the human experience. Glory be to God
I forgive you bro
We love you Will and we glad to know that you are fine and you are still working on yourself ❤❤
You are human Will. Move forward and I’m still supporting anything you do Brotha. A lot of the people judging and having a whole lot to say if you knew them on a personal level and everything they have done and are still doing you would see they don’t have wiggle room to talk about or judge anybody.
Very classy of you to do this Will. You have a lot of respect from me. One bad incident never changed that but this just kept that respect I have for you alive and well.
Peakkk
Can we just take a moment to acknowledge that Will Smith hasn't done up his laces 🤔
You are awesome for this apology and manning up for what you did. We all make mistakes at some point. Some may be small and some may be big. But, as long as we learn from these mistakes and don’t repeat them, we’re all good. Thank you, Mr. Handcock for this.
We're all human, we make mistakes we forgive and move on.
Been waiting for this to come out. Saw it on the gram and knew it would be here too. This was heartfelt and we all make mistakes in life. Good you realize it hurt more than just him. Hell I don’t even know either of you and it hurt me. It is what it is will and you will be forgiven in due time when they are ready. Keep grinding and keep searching for the path of righteousness that we all need. Bless you bro and wish tou the best
"There's no part of me that thinks that's the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults" That right there makes me think, nahhh he still doesn't get it.  You were laughing until you looked at your Boss.  This is just damage control, YOU'RE DONE!!! I was a big fan. never again will you get a penny of my money.  Trash
This is what being a man of honor is, been with you since Bel air.
Who’s Will Smith?
Nobody is perfect, you did what you taught was right.  Learn from the mistake & move forward. You are a legend & we are here to continue supporting you.
I'd be praying you
Nice acting
💓🕊️🌈
He should have waited another 6 months to post this because the wound is still  fresh to me
Real adults apologize
The man was a GREAT role model for almost two decades. The fact that all of the things he’s done are almost obsolete because of ONE year in which he made mistakes, tells a lot about the nature of this world we’re living in. I hope he’s good mentally, man!
don't worry will, I bought your skin on fortnite and im using John Cena's hand for my pickaxe. hope you and Chris can sort things out.
Bit dramatic but ok, and took a while
Te quiero Will desde que era un adolescente y siempre te querré, soy de España. Hiciste y haces mi vida feliz en cuanto te veo. Todos cometemos errores. Que tus 7 Almas no estén tristes más tiempo. Un abrazo muy muy fuerte desde tu querida España.
We are all humans we do mistakes sometimes nobody’s perfect! Keep it up Big Willie
Remember want you taught us. Lay one perfect brick every day. This is your perfect brick, 🙂thank you.
But it was a real way frfr 💯
This really speaks for the W in Will
We love you Will❤️
Ok
Booooooo
And the best drama award goes to… Will 🙌
Thanks for sharing !!!
🐊  😭
Nobody is too big for an apology
i clicked on the video with the expectation that i would be underwhelmed by a standard apology kind of video but I do appreciate the idea that will is looking at the situation and trying to understand why he did what he did. it is important to understand why people do things like this, or why anyone does anything bad. more knowledge on this sort of thing is valuable for everyone, not just the person who does the actions.  also about the apology, i think there really isnt a way to express that the right way even if you are sincere. you can only hope that chris and his family will make the choice to open a dialogue, but at the end of the day it is their choice whatever they choose to do.
No need for all this. We are all human.
Great example of owning your mess!!! Proud of you Will, keep going man. God will always humble us to help us grow.
People were making fun of you for a whole year so I get it, you snapped on somebody who pretty much didn’t deserve it.
My GOODNESS.  I PRAY HE IS READY FOR THE MEDIA STORM THAT IS COMING HIS WAY!!!!!
Props to you for not doing this for money with some media outlet.
You’re such a positive light 💯💯💗💗💗
LOVE YOU! I appreciate your journey and the rawness you have shown us all. You are a role model in so many rights, but this right here is something truly to look up to. I appreciate your journey!
I completely understand your actions BUT, at every award show music or movie the host is always roasting a celebrity and no one  he’s ever retaliated with physical harm, you broke the one rule we all understand…don’t take it personal it’s just comedy.
Hey slappy, I'm so sorry I can't watch u anymore. Don't make excuses
Still the one of the Greatest ever😍😘💝💝💖🥰🥰🥰
Thank you Will we love you keep your head up
It's been how many months and nows he's apologizing.
Much love and respect. Keep working on yourself brother 🤲🏾
Yassssssssss!  BIG WILL IS BACKKKKKK!!!!!!!
Dude, don't be so hard on yourself.  You're better than all this. I'm not gona get preachy, but I strongly believe in God having power through people, and He uses you.  You must see that and harness that.  I have a sister who has Cerebral Palsy and can't walk or talk from it who absolutely loves you.  She cheered when you did "that".  She never stopped loving you.  To her, you're still her "Bad Boy Fresh Prince".  She is a great judge of character in people.  And she sees no malice in you.  You are still her hero.  And always will be.
Thank you for this, Will. You are loved regardless ❤️
This was painful because we grew up watching you being the opposite of what happened that night. I am sure the reflective period about this was difficult for you, but I think we are ready to move on.
Happy to see you back Will 🙏🏼♥️
unfortunate place of the light on the shelf.
You’re human nobody was mad or anything nobody is perfect
I was just worried about your mental health. You didn't disappoint me, to be honest. two wrongs kind of situation. Much love Mr. Smith.
You always show up and share your authentic self. It was a moment in time where your shadow self took over, it takes courage to take responsibility and ownership.  You are human. People are still supportive of what you’ve built in your entire career.
I have watched you grow from nothing to what you are now witch is something special and that will never change for me. People do things they regret and go through hard times in life that will change them or not change them. I know you have changed in a way for the better or are trying to change for the better. I will always look up to you and be by your side no matter what happens because I know who you really are as a person, artist, athlete, actor and most of all a husband and a father. Much respect and love my brother!
You were wrong to do what you did but you don’t deserve to have your life ruined
Sending positive vibes and prayers Will!
L + ratio + chris better
Who cares…back to Beyoncé
I will forever be a fan of yours. NO ONE is perfect. I said this when the incident happened and I will say it again....you are not the only one who should be apologizing. There was a reason you REACTED. And he walks around like it's cool and IT IS NOT. I can not support someone that does/says something wrong and thinks they get a pass on disrespect.   You are the bigger man for apologizing. Much love and respect.
I so hope that the two of you can work this out . You both are awesome & this was heart breaking to see. We all go through things & have to deal with the circumstances, that’s life. But healing comes when you get to the root of the problem & work to make it better. I see that in you & applaud you for that. Blessings & peace to you & Chris.
Man life is too short to think a lot and be complex about everything. Be sorry or don't be. It's not just that we are learning who you are everyday. It's more importantly you are learning about yourself a lot as well. Which in my opinion, the hardest lesson to learn. Being honest about it, ain't easy. But it's the right way forward. ✌️  With that said, you are 0% sorry about it. It's ok to live with it and learn. What's done is done. No one cares about it. but fortunately or unfortunately God does. It's a chance for you learn his nature. His grace and why we call his form of being a grace. As with the right understanding of yourself through this, you can see and experience all of this turn into a thing of positive learning through your perseverance and hardwork.
We love you nevertheless.
We love you Will!
Hope your back soon
We'd love to see you with Chris addressing real apologies to each other publicly as brothers, and spending some times to dressing the wound that was difficult to handle for all of us. That being said you're still a good person Will.
''uhhmm''
Quest love won an award ? That’s the first I’m hearing of this
I understood then and now ,I’m team Will
That’s enough said. Forgiven
big up Will, we still love you
Still love you champ ❤
Hey will, if you’re reading this. I just want you to know, its okay to make mistakes. In the heat of the moment we can experience rage, that can blind us and impact our decision making. please take time to heal from this and know that you are not 100% at fault.  Important thing is you’re acknowledging your mistake! We all love you and we will always support you
We can see the sincerity in your face and we hear it in your voice. We all make mistakes yours just happened to be on a larger scale. We have already forgiven you. We never stopped being friends. Love you, Will!!!
Those that get it, get it. We love you Will! 🙏🏽
Bro trying to avoid that lawsuit, and the flaming coming from Chris
lol…remember guys. This is an actor. He’s lying. He’s not sorry about it.
The Academy can ban him but me personally he remains my inspiration.
As a fellow Philadelphian and a fan of yours, I was so profoundly disappointed in your actions and behavior.   I'm glad you have done this, but I'm still disappointed.
Sen mükemmel bir insansın ✨
Happens man! Best of luck for rest the journey! Gob bless you!
It's all good Will.  We never stopped being friends/fans.  Mistakes grow us.  Thank you for sincerely apologizing and hopefully you and Chris will find the resolve needed to move on.
You will always be a beloved actor. Mental instability can cause people irrational things.
Lets get that 10mill
I Love You 💖 We are Human...we make mistakes 🥰✨ Keep your head up Love But Got💝😘😍✨🌹🌹🌹
Please be good to yourself! And have no shame!
This is heartbreaking to see
Clown 🤡
Too late bro, too late
Dude I don’t even know, I’ve just literally started the video and paused to comment with tears in my eyes oh Good Lord JESUS Christ have your way in this Man’s  life meet him in the exact area of need JESUS
Ahhh, a video 4 months too late
You learned from your mistakes 🤝
Well said. You are still loved, by the way.
You are a good man, an inspiration. It is nice to hear you react but don´t be that hard on you. It´s ok.
How to lose respect all over the world in 20 seconds.
The world will forgive you. Take your time to heal. Love you Unc.
We’re all human & we all deserve forgiveness & grace  Sending you love Will 💕💕💕
❤️❤️❤️
It was wack what you did Will.  God has a way of crushing ego's, and sometimes we need our ego's crushed at some point. You chose to be in the public spotlight and with that comes responsibility.  I grew up having positive vibes from Fresh Prince, and that's how I relate to you as one soul to another in this world consciousness. The 90's was such a great era for me, and you was part of my view on the world at that time.  Time is a great healer, some people will forgive your actions, and some people wont. Will also needs to forgive Will, but that's a journey for yourself.  I wish you all the best Will.  Peace.
❤️❤️
Jada’s boyfriend is laughing at u bro
I'm hanging on Will. We all are.😍 We love you!♥️
We will always love you 😍
What a great actor! 😏😉
Time to come back will we miss u
I was as angry as everyone else, but People make mistakes. Nobody is perfect, But because we are humans it is within our capacity to forgive. It’s time to forgive and move on.
First of all, I appreciate you Will for taking personal responsibility, as well as accountability for your actions. As a fan since I was 12 years old, you've always been a true inspiration. It's refreshing to see you moving in the right direction, and showing your humanity. Keep your head up bro. We all believe this storm will definitely pass. God bless you and your family. From Mikel(Ma-kel) from Michigan
damn,will. mozambique love you
We love u will
This will be resolved in time.
Imagine making a mistake in front of millions of people. It's humiliating. But then imagine how much strength it takes to say "yes, I was wrong, I'm working on myself." Will, I'm impressed by you! I'm sure that the media will write very negative, bad stuff even now (they always do), but it doesn't matter for me, I see that you understand everything and I see your desire to grow, which is so inspiring. Sending you love❤️
We love you will!! Take your time , we gonna suport you always!
I don’t think he’s being honest about jadas behavior but either way, the apology is genuine.
This Too Shall Pass...
If you close your eyes and listen to him speak, you can see how much energy he’s putting into bettering himself. He’s truly being open and honest. He’s grateful for his life and wants to live with that grace.
💕💕💕💕💕💕
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ you’re loved!!!
We love you!!!  💜💜💜
You HAVE to get away from that woman man. Look what being with her has done to your quality of mental health, it's utterly destroyed it. You deserve soooo much better than her. You did what you did, and you accept accountability. To next step is to ask yourself what led you to doing that in that moment psychologically and address that factor appropriately.
It takes a real man to face these hard questions with absolute truth and openness. No one is perfect, much respect for this Will.
I respect this apology.  You acknowledged the people you hurt and how and made that your focus instead of you.  You didn't equivocate or offer excuses, you just said sorry.    That's how apologies should be.
THANKS MR. SMITH FOR THE APOLOGY CORPORATELY YOU TRULY DIDN'T OWE US ANY EXPLAINING ON YOUR END YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO TRIED TO JUDGE YOU FOR YOUR FAULTS SIMPLY IS DOWN RIGHT SAD 😔 YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HERO AND ONE OF THE GREATEST ENTERTAINERS OF MY GENERATION / OF ALL TIME!!!!!! LOL 💯 THANKS AGAIN FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU ARE HUMAN WHETHER YOU HAVE 2 DOLLARS IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT OR 2.55 BILLION WE ARE ALL HUMAN AND WE MAKE MISTAKES 😉 💯
We  love you Will! 😭
Hey if God made us perfect we probably would need to exist and share respectable values with others
Good call not going on some talk show and making it a show.
Must've been hard for Will he's always been a chill and relaxed guy but with what happened he just felt the need to explain so bot only he would it feel like what happened was wrong but to let the believers know it was just one of those irrational things we do on the moment as a human to defend those that we love ❤️  -Love you Will chin up
STILL A FAN OF YOU MAN
Welcome back!🤗 The overreaction by people online is laughable.  Will Smith is a human being. Let him without sin cast the first stone.
This is a setback but stay on your GRIND brotha. The world still needs you.
Self sabotage is a real thing. Acknowledging it is healing
Chris is my favorite political comic. I miss you Will. I'm here when you're ready.
Taking responsibility for your actions is the first step!
We're still friends Will.
Mistakes happen. The bad part was making the mistake at the moment it happened, that's the only reason the shock was so hard. Its tough because the mistake wasn't just on his part towards Chris, it was also towards the Williams family, to Quest Love, to all the nominees. It's definitely a tough road ahead. This is a start. Let's hope we all learn from this, and strive to become better.
Why did you feel like you had the right to stand up, walk over, and physically strike another human being?
Love you no matter what man!
I love this man he makes me wanna be a better man to people. He's like a superhero but without the uniform or cape and his powers are his humility and humanity towards others. Even in this I love Will Smith the world needs this guy trust and believe that. He's one of the greatest actors of our time, and in a time where it may not be as trendy to love our wive's or black women due to some of their systematic programming I understand Will's desire to have normalcy in his household and I respect him. We need to give this man his flowers while he is still here💯 because trust and believe that their is only one Will Smith and their will never be another.
YOU HAVE ALWAYS DID THE RIGHT THING OVER THE YEARS BUT YOU'RE HUMAN BIG WILL!
You are loved and appreciated, Will. Take your time. We are here.
No one is perfect, I appreciate you more for this even though I understood that moment. I've been there, Thank you for all that you do! You're still an amazing role model in my eyes!🥰🙏
Will my son and I as well as many other's have truly been concerned about you and have missed you dearly. With great innerstanding we forgive you. We love and appreciate you❣️  FYI..Your moon is your mood learn the shifts in energy it WILL help you navigate significantly 💞
I will always look up to you, regardless. Man is to error. I hope Chris accepts your apology and you guys talk things out. I Love you Will.
We all have that moment where we have instant regret...don't live in that moment, don't go back to that either, and don't reside in that time bcuz that's not who you are. Your Philly came out (😉) and that's ok, but you too will rise above this moment and we will remember who are not who you were in a moment. Much love ❤️
Been praying for you and for your soul.  I’ve been asking Jesus to please enter your heart and save you.  I write this, because I know at your core you don’t want to fail and failing maybe detrimental to you.  But Christ takes on all of that.  Allow Him to bring His peace.  Allow Holy Spirit to rest upon you.  You are just a man in need of a Savior.  I promise you if you release it all to The Lord, He’ll heal all those broken areas inside of you and give you strength to get up again, but this time you’ll be new!  Hope you read this comment and take it in.  Been praying for your family as well.  Many people have a heart for you to realize that you are a child of God and you must run to The Father that’s where your help comes from.  God bless you.
Thank you, Will. It maybe a long road back but I think you’ve set off on the right foot by accepting responsibility for your actions and the consequences that come with them. In a day and age when lying to cover-up things is common in politics and public opinion, you’ve shown that being honest, remorseful, and accepting of responsibility is the better path to healing for everyone. For that you have my respect and renewed admiration.
He needs to leave that witch. She broke him beyond repair
One step closer to world peace.
We are all human and we make mistakes.  It took a lot of vulnerability and strength to apologize and the only step from here is forgiveness and healing.  May the Peace and love resurface internally and May this lesson be an action that leads to love.  Amen
We all make mistakes, there is so much wrong in the world right now and so many thing that people should be really mad about. You tried to protect your family in the heat of the moment. We all love you and support you
This too shall pass.. dont you worry things will settle ❤
😎
We are all human like you said.  doesn't mean the action was acceptable.. but it also does not make you any less human for it either. I hope everyone can heal from this in due course.
Happy to see you will
We ALL make mistakes.  This was beautiful.  Thank you.
Time heals all.
I like it, but I feel it a little scripted.   I hope you learn from this will, Im still a fan.
This was excellent! This was brilliant!ä This video was exactly the right thing to do! 👏
We are all fragile and broken people, continue to stay true to yourself Will. Press forward.  Iove you  so much. We need you.  Continue to take care of yourself. We need you. Luv ya🖤🤎❤
You're not a bad guy Will Smith. Just know this!
Since this happened quite a few people have come out and expressed that this is an actual pattern of behavior. While I certainly believe in forgiveness, I hope this is a turning point for you towards all people ESPECIALLY when the cameras ARENT around. You have brought a lot of joy to people. I hope you can eventually repair all the relationships you have damaged. God bless.
We all know forgiveness can't be forced...and Mercy is something that one doesn't deserve,  but is granted or given...We all need Mercy in this life and the next.   Will, it seems you still have some hostility with Chris inwardly but truly regret the hurt you caused his family and others...Usually when we are defensive about our actions..we still feel we have that right to have acted the way we did...I  think your a good guy who finally exploded from carrying yourself in the "right" way..for years...suppressed emotions and hurt is dangerous.. hopefully you get to the root of it. Smiling and pretending to be okay when your not..is not okay..and blowing up isn't either...How can we all get to a place where we share how we feel.. without causing someone harm OR recieve empathy from the offender when we tell them how their actions or words hurt?? Forgiveness... and Mercy... is the only way... through Christ Jesus..he taught us how to love and forgive..He was the perfect example..his love is matchless And  any other way leads to destruction.
Personally, I’m not even a Will Smith fan, but I think this seemed sincere. Celebrities are people and people make mistakes. Maybe you wouldn’t have made THIS mistake, but we’ve all done things that were hurtful to others and a lot of us don’t even have the decency to apologize, let alone in front of the world. So honestly, good for  him, and maybe one day, when Chris is ready they can repair things. I think this is an excellent reminder for adults to think before you act. We say it so often to our children, but sometimes it’s us who needs to hear this the most.
We all make mistakes!  We all have bad days where we misjudge things, people, and situations.  We just got to atone to God and to each other and try to right the wrong the best way we can, and with help of God He can mend the broken fences.
Clown
❤
It's okay we all know that whatever you're going through it's hard to notice that you're going through a lot of things or your your family your friends the people that you love and your fans we are all with you and I just wanted to let you know that I accept your apology I love you and good day to you and tell your family that I said hello.
Love you Will 💎 just keep being great 😊 keep shining ⭐️
As a real real fan, man I appreciate just seeing and hearing you right now!   We all make mistakes My Brother but you are definitely doing the right thing and just speaking for myself even though we never met,,,,   I believe you are genuinely a great great guy who just had a tough moment and reacted wrongly but it takes a lot to speak back on that moment and take responsibility for your actions and you are absolutely doing that! Mad respect!   This is why I’m still a fan and now back to my Movie lol (Independence Day)   Side note- the second version sucked without you in it lol.    Much love my brother! 💯💯💯👊🏾
I wasn’t shocked at your mistake, Will. Surprised, maybe. But, not shocked because you are human just like the rest of us and we’ve all made mistakes that we came to truly, truly regret. In your quest for growth and improvement (which shows humility and wisdom), while still knowing your worth, you are still setting an awesome example even at a time which hasn’t been your finest hour. That is something to be proud of, and should reinforce any doubt you may have about who you are and your worth. 💜
I love you, Uncle Will! I don’t look at you any differently. You are human and that was a spur of the moment incident. You are still an awesome person! You cannot be stopped! God is with you! Keep your head up, Unc!
Wow
Love you will so much x your a gentleman and it shouldn't be held against you at all.
We love you Will!💖 Everything takes time and patients. Patients with yourself and others.
It's very important that we get behind his decision to apologize and hopefully this can become a new normal. Because our society is deeply lacking in forgiveness and saying "I'm sorry"
You have always been a role model and you always be my role model. It's only human to make mistakes and we learn from the mistakes and accept the hurt we caused, it's as you said “At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you."
I love you Willard!
Most have done worse !
Yeah soooo you're not unlike every other imperfect person.  Forgive yourself!  Anyone who takes issue with your beyond the wounded human level.... they also need to do the work.   God Bless you and your family!👑💜💫
✌️👍
My cousin was an air hostess out of London on a private airline 15 years ago she said you were the most horrible humans.,.,…. Ever…………. She will not ever watch his movies since
Love you and this!❤️
Love you Will, we're always gonna be friends man.
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH
No apologies its a fair 1v1 after that then we can talk.
Personally, I’m not even a Will Smith fan, but I think this seemed sincere. Celebrities are people and people make mistakes. Maybe you wouldn’t have made THIS mistake, but we’ve all done things that were hurtful to others and a lot of us don’t even have the decency to apologize, let alone in front of the world.

We say it so often to our children, but sometimes it’s us who needs to hear this the most.
I'm so proud of you 👏! You're a living legend and I pray you both speak and heal from this.
You had such a big impact on my life, and I will always love your work (even After Earth). I have been through my fair share crap in my life, and haven’t been okay recently due to some health issues. I am glad that you have taken responsibility and working to improve. I could use some of that motivation, myself. I know you probably won’t see this, but you’re one of my favorite actors and I love you! Thanks for being a real man and an inspiration  Keep going, King! You got this.
❤
Taking accountability for your own actions, bravo sir.
Love You man, you need to get back your inner peace🧙 hope things get better for You will
People need to understand that this man is human. He made a mistake. This man is one of the best actors of all time. I have so much love and respect for this man because it takes a lot to apologize. With all the things that happening in the world, we can ABSOLUTELY accept him and love his work. Thank you Mr.Will! 🙏🏾❤️
You made a big mistake that was very public but it is honorable and respected to see you trying to make it right and own up to your mistakes.
I am so happy you did not do this on red table talk. This is about you as a man. A strong man. I want you to continue standing for yourself. Ten toes down! Head up high. Let go of the toxic people or influence that make you feel less than.
We have missed you!
We're all with you will....love from🇮🇳
You’re family has been bringing heat on themselves over the years it’s literally y’all branding at this point
The only way to truly apologize to the entire comedy community is letting Jeff Ross host an epic Will Smith roast . 😁
His PR team in finally going to work? Are they trying to make this look as staged as possible? Dr Jeckle Mr Hyde
It’s funny to me how people get so caught up with, in the “crossfire”, when one is triggered. However, no one seem’s to be concerned with the trigger itself, and how to treat it. We live in a world of hypocrisy. We preach things like, brotherhood and helping one another. However, when one of our “brother’s”, need help, we are ready to ridicule and loose respect for them. Simply for being human. Having all the money, and the fame that goes with it, doesn’t change the fact that, Will still puts on his pants, one leg at a time. It doesn’t change the fact that, he still has everyday issues, just like everyone else. For those of you who’ve lost respect for him, or would like to see him behind bars, I asked you the following…  Which one of you are perfect? Which one of you have done something in public, that you’re not proud of? I’m willing to believe, quite a few of you have. So, why do you persecute him? Is it because of his fame and fortune? Again, this is man, who like most of us, put on his pants, one leg at a time. He is no different from us. If one little mistake can cause an entire group of people to condemn one man,(who is just like them), then what does that say about how we look at ourselves?   Humble pie is free. I suggest some come get themselves a slice…
Just keep taking it one day at a time, Will.  You’ll get to the other side of this and life will be sweeter than ever. 🌀✨💌
Yasssss! 🔥
Whew, i felt his heart (as I do with so many of his videos)... before he even said it, I answered the question for him: "I'm human." We shouldn't hold people to standards that they did not create. The ONLY standard is Jesus Christ, that's Who we should attain to follow: His ways. Will is only human, a human who is living thru psychological and emotional things as we all do. If he makes a mistake, show the same GRACE that we ourselves often ask for.  Man, I SOOO felt Will's heart in this. And sir, we're still friends. That's never changed.
I understand the power of forgiveness but I also OVERstand the power of asking forgiveness of someone that you've hurt!  I hope the best for you both moving ahead.  💓
Before people come to judge and attack. I appreciate you as an entertainer actor comedian but most  importantly as a human being. Very much still a fan and I wish you well ❤
Still love him
7/10 for YouTub apologies. Innovative Q&A for an apology vid, but not enough actor crying
Will smith more like cringe Smith 🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
The best sorry video on YouTube aha
God bless you🥺
Too soon...
No one is perfect. We are all human. One reason I still respect you is your acknowledgement of this.
YouTube apology video 😂😂😂😂
1 wish I could have like that message 100 times or more. That was great a message.
"If i was will smith i would've smacked him with a stick" 🤣
You aught to get out of Hollywood that place and the people seem poisonous to the soul
Mistakes always may happen from us, because we are humans. But what is important being aware that we made a mistake and learn from our mistakes as well try to fix the problem if it possible. I appreciate that you are trying to apologize and solve this issue.  We are human and none of us is perfect. ♥️
Everyone makes mistakes, keep your head up king 👑
당신이 사과할 필요 없었습니다. 잘못은 크리스가 했죠.
Great gesture Sir. You need somebody to help you. Make Effort to settele greviences between Amber and jony Depp. Than you would have Amber and Depp in your side and with Good Result. True persuit of happiness
I always liked you and think you’re an amazing actor…. You made a mistake and you should be forgiven….Public mistakes are hard to deal with….Move forward with love … In time everything will be okay.
First question and answer tells you everything. He wasn’t fogged out. He thought he could get away with it and spin it to defending his woman. He went and partied the night away. Only the next day when he saw the backlash did any remorse come out and that came from fear of reputation loss and money loss, sorry Will you showed who you really are, which is why Chris isn’t answering you.
You are a human being and made a mistake and will move on and so will we
As someone who looks up to you, all that REALLY needs saying is you gave into anger, and now you attempt to redeem yourself and rise above it. It takes courage and I can say you're on the right track to gaining my admiration again. I Already do so for the fact you made this video.
This is excellent. one of the keys to a happier life is to be forgiving in nature, this way, you live a happier life along with the person you've apologized. Well done my friend, That is how legends are made 👍👍🙌🙌
Will im rocking with you man. But im happy you did reach out to him privately.
💜
Respect! It's enough shame already and if you shame yourself it gets worse and you suffocate in guilt..Heal brother.
They (Chris, Chappelle, Hart) already forgave you Will; they called you a "G.O.A.T." Greatest of all time.
Truly shows what a lifetime of fame and money can do to someone. Sad Fr.
Such humility. Good luck for what's to come. Humans can be savage, they are blood thirsty, so you will still get flack after this video. May God protect you, Will.
Win, lose or draw I’m rocking with you
No matter how rich, successful or mature a person is, no matter how hurtful, embarrassing or public our actions are there is grace, mercy and forgiveness for everyone. It's hard to learn these tough lessons with the world watching. It's also more important for us to learn how to forgive  ourselves. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Much respect Mr. Smith
LMAOOOOOO
why is he saying sorry to HIS family ? lmfao pathetic
It’s strange to hear you say that you think that was not the right way to behave when your son tweets right after “And that’s how we do it.” You seem to have taught your son a different lesson.
I hate disappointment too
Will is so kind he needs to be respected
Mad respect Will, you are a true living legend 🙏🏾👏🏾
Love you Will! ❤
Gotta rebuild, it’s the only way 👊🏿
Everyone makes mistakes in life we learn from them and it makes us a better person
Too bad we gonna love you forever Will !!!
clown
Good job 👏
You're a real man, much respect.
You had an human experience, I can’t wait to see your growth! ❤️ you deserve grace
I get you Will. You made a mistake that so many people have made, you just did it in the public eye. I think it’s great you’re owning up to it, working on yourself, and making it clear you don’t approve of your past actions, and that’s all you can really do now. I support you.
Any other black man reacted in this way would be in jail.  Im with 2nd chances.  This is what happens to entitled people in our world...he only feels bad because of how the world responded to his BS.
Nothing more respectable than taking accountability for your own actions.
This felt like a very sincere and genuine apology. I have been a fan of Will Smith's since I was a preteen and I still am. He took the time he needed, sought out professional help and is making the changes deemed necessary to never repeat those actions. I admire the maturity and courage it took to publicly speak about the unfortunate situation and admit his wrongdoings.
Wey love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everyone does mistakes . Only a handful of people come forward and apologise for their mistakes.  Apology accepted 👍
❤️❤️❤️ love you
Y en español 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Will, We like people for their strengths, but love them for their faults, the axiom goes but let me tack this on: Especially when they are honest about it. Thank you, for doing that. I hope Chris reaches out soon and you two can talk and work everything out. Godspeed friend. :)
We all grow and learn from mistakes. 🙏
We all have made mistakes because ….. we are human . It takes humility to apologize and compassion to forgive!  Will , you are an inspiration not a icon ( 😉 ) You are going to comeback stronger then ever 💪🏿
I love you Will Smith and you are Big actor and Kiss of the France 😘🇲🇫🇱🇷💯👍🙏
The problem I have in life is that I often know exactly what to say & what people want to hear. But it's difficult to be honest to myself, even when it sounds honest towards the public.  I wish you the best of luck with that same problem Will.
Hi Will❣️ You are human. You F-ed up, along with a lot of us. You've apologized. Some of us are still your friend and the rest of us will come back around sooner or later.  💕
Oh Will, so much love for you ❤️ I support you a 100% I really do. You deserve it because you're an amazing person. 😘
He is Human this is a moment to understand that no one is perfect and he is still a role model just by being sincere and himself The fact that he’s answering everyone’s questions that takes a lot of strength to do . Will you are loved and supported and you are enough!
We are all just trying to survive the human experience. We all mess up, say things and do things that are at times, not the best decisions for ourselves or those around us. I cannot imagine “messing up” in the public eyes and on the biggest stage of the world. You are world wide famous. Everything you do or not do has implications that ripple with way more impact than my little pebble. I love you Will Smith always have and always will and I’m really proud of you for this message. I hope one day you can be restored to your friends. Everything will work out .. it takes time, but God and Love is bigger than all of us. Keep going 💛 #willsmithfanforlife
It’s all Jadas fault. Will needs to leave before she completely destroys him.
WE WAS ROOTING FOR YOU! WE WAS ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!... (in my Tyra voice) lol! Yes you are human. But you are a celebrity, People hold you at a higher standard. Obviously. Praying for peace and closure for all involved. <3
1st off,you are not a piece of S, 2nd- Thank you,we all needed this
May you find peace ,you are forgiven
Yeah right. Your PR team helped you draft answers to these questions.
U have always been a clean stand up guy. People make mistakes. I'm still with you Will. 🙏❤
I didn’t think I needed this but after this video, I feel better and hope you do too will. The human struggle is something we all must overcome. Welcome back my brotha.. Missed you!!!
Stay out of scientology and stuff like that, PLEASE¡¡✌🏼☮️
We love you Will!!! Don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you all will be able to move past this at some point. We miss you, glad to see you back😊
Love bro 🙏🏽
❤️
You're only human Will. Mistakes happen don't sweat it.
I forgive you will
Will Smith is in the same situation Chris Brown is in.
The past is just a side mirror to reflect on, the real mirror is the one right in front of you❤
What’s UP! Will! We love you out here!
Proud of you. I can say if I ever did the same I hope I am man enough to level with my fans and step up to the bar you set for men around the world. Thanks Will.
Please let this be the last apology for how you defended a beautiful black woman.
I’m so tired of these people dawg
❤
Dear will. You acted like any man would act if someone disrespect he's wire or gf. Was it the right time? Definitely not, so to all ppl out there that think different or shaming you don't a women or not man enough to stand up for he's women......
Love you so much!!!! And well done for doing this
Sending love and light!
LOL what a time to be alive
Too little too late.
this is too late
you wasn’t wrong tho
I can breathe,  finally a comment section that reflects the best in us human beings,  thank you WILL,  been holding my breath for you bro.....you came through, peace and blessing to both you and CHRIS's family.
I still don’t Forgive You. You are still Canceled To Me
I love you Will❣. You are human and we all make mistakes. Your true fans got your back ❣💋❤
Love you, Will.
Me. Smith wants it known that he has said these things. He, and those invested in him, want a public record of him saying these things.  I do not believe that Mr. Smith is being sincere about his feelings, and you shouldn’t believe it either.
The ones chastising Will are mainly mad at their own failures in life. Sure, it was a wrong move to do that to Chris but don’t sit there and act like you’re all saints and angels, lmao.
I love you.. still 💜
We respect your sincere apology. Keep ur head up. We all make mistakes.💕
Sempre achei Will Smith um dos artistas mais honestos de Hollywood. Assisti Bell Air e confesso que chorei diversas vezes nos dilemas que seu personagem enfrentou. Eu espero do fundo do meu coração que Will consiga recuperar seu espaço devido depois de nos levar a muitas viagens cinematográficas que me fizeram pensar em como aquilo contribuiu pra minha formação de caráter. Desde ser predestinado em ALI ou como ser um pai Devoto em Depois da terra. São inúmeros filmes que fazem parte da minha formação como homem e como professor de cinema. Obrigado, Will Smith.
No matter what we are still here for you.
i always looked up to u since i was a kid, and still do! my image i had for u didnt change at all, this moment only showed me how human u are,if that makes sense? stay safe <3
Missed you 😭 😭 hope you are doing well and praying for your continued healing ❤️❤️❤️
Whatever you do man know there's people still supporting you
I forgive you Will, I respect and support you always.
As long as you forgive yourself man.
👏 Good Job,  Remember HanCock
Please do not disregard the lifetime of joy, laughter and escape from reality that you brought to us. A lifetime should not be erased by a bad moment. He's human and deserves some grace
I want to hug you. Every single one of us has done done something that we've later regretted. It becomes hard to forgive ourselves when the world won't allow us to and interferes with negative comments, energy, etc.. Forgive yourself, love yourself, be Will. ❤🤗
💞💞💞💞💞
You are human, we are humans, we have emotions, and you said it. Life goes on. We came here with nothing, we leave this world with nothing. I hope things can be developed in better ways for the future.
This whole stunt was staged! We only saw one angle with ALL the cameras they have!?!? Things that make you say Hmmmm!!
Ok he is back will...you forgot about us  your fans....❤️🇰🇪
We human ♥️ he personally didn't let anyone down. He may have disappointed them. But WILL has to learn from his mistakes. Of course those whom you offended i.e. Chris I get that apology
It was hard to watch but it was human.  Supporting you.
👍👍👍
Thank you for your honesty, we are all works in progress, love ya king
Stay strong Will , we are with you 🙏👍
Should have been kicked out and not been awarded
Getting my way through your book Will. It’s decent
💜 Respect for your words and the intention here. Go easy on yourself.
Glad to hv u back.
Solid apology!   Best with your perpetual journey.
U need to become the best of the chosen people of God! Those holding onto the true commands God initiated to Abraham! The Muslims ! Those who submit to the will of God! No pork no alcohol no intoxicants no drugs no interest only eat clean food curcumcise physically  n take the Shahada! U might think all religions have the same criteria but none holds them in strict observance except ISLAM! Embrace it n be the true guardian of this world God entrusted to us! Material wealth will cease when we leave this world but our deeds n moral actions will follow us in the hereafter n gain us the pleasure of our Creator! U by default has excellent character! Your huge loyal following will acquire true salvation!
Honestly my view on you hasn't changed, still an amazingly gifted individual outside of entertainment. Appreciate all you have done in my life uncle will, it was a moment where too many pokes at the bear and you flashed out. Nobody is perfect so I'd never look at you threw that scope
It nice that he was able to take 3 months off to process this. Not many people are able to do that.
Bro... We love you Will. That's it. We love Will Smith.
Awesome
You made a mistake.  You're owning it.  You're still my dude!  Let's go, let's go, let's grow!  :)
If the bible states that those without sin can cast the first stone, then no stone can ever be thrown since we’ve all done things we are ashamed of. Life is about growing and learning from past mistakes. Over here, we love Will Smith and we will continue to love you forever for always.
L post
This was so sincerely cathartic on so many levels
Don’t wait for Chris to accept your apology. Accept that it won’t come Will.
We love you Will!!!
Be easy will! We’re all healing from something and we’re all growing! “Thou shall not judge”
So much respect to you for owning your mistakes... we all make them. Much love
Will, if you see this, I just want to say that I've been a fan ever since I watched Fresh Prince as a boy. I've always admired your character and your work ethic, and have ever only had the utmost respect for you. There is no defending of course what happened on that stage, nor are you trying to, and I hope that one day Chris and you are able to make some sort of peace, but you're human, you made a mistake, and I just want to say, as a fan, I've forgiven you. I hope others can find it within themselves to do the same. This was a learning moment, and we are living in a time when I think it could say a lot about us as people to find a little forgiveness within us. Though you may not think you deserve it right now, I just want to say I still look up to you. Sending peace and love your way. P.S. My Dad's from Philly. P.P.S. I've always wanted to be a movie director since I was 9, and my first job working on a studio movie set was as a Production Assistant on Bad Boys For Life. That will forever be a part of my journey, so thank-you.
Welcome back Big Will 👏🏾
You've always been a huge part of my childhood Will and I know we all make mistakes and sometimes it takes time for us to be forgiven but we're all human I still love you will no matter what you've always been a true definition of a real man take care Will❤️
I love you before and will after. Welcome back and don’t let the media and other irrelevant ppl who speak on you make you feel otherwise.
Will, you’re a honest man for putting this out and starting the process to overcome it. Most would’ve had it happen and move on but you’re clearly in a space where you know what you did was incorrect and you’re looking, longing, and wanting to fix it. Proud to have you as an idol of mine and owning up to your mistakes. Still the 🐐 and thank you for being human!
As long as you realized you're wrong doings, you're a great human being.
Don't get your head down over a mistake. On the contrary, raise your head and own up to what you did and apologize, show that you are sorry. That shows strength Everyone makes mistakes but they hide it. As soon as someone makes a mistake they jump on you and say what a bad person you are just so they can hide theirs. We love you will
clearly a horriible judgement call happened, and it was on TV... now lets move forward, i do think you are still the men you presented before this incident.  Keep your chin up.  It can just get better from here
It breaks my heart to see the person who's always smiling and laughing and bringing joy to others through their work and philanthropic deeds, look so broken. You are human and allowed to feel things and react in a way that's not calculated or expected by the masses. We all have our own walk and these people that have cast stones have done much worse. I'm still a big fan and have staunchly defended you. I hope you heal whatever YOU feel needs healing. We love you Willard!
💙💚
We still love you will
that's honorable of you!
We all make mistakes Will. Please don't beat yourself up anymore. You're still amazing regardless of what happened. Grace is enough.🙏🏼❤️
Stop punishing yourself. Three months is a long time. We have all learned and now it’s time to grow. What’s past is past, we can only move forward.
We all do things we wish we could take back.  Yours was in the most public forum.   Hope you recover from the backlash and reconcile with Chris and others.    Always admired your work
keep telling the truth will we support you
Que pena que nos enteramos de esa manera que claramente eres un madreador
MAJOR RESPECT MY DAWG!!!!!!!
I missed you so much. this got me so emotional. after reading your book my love for you just grew and I’m sending you love and healing. we are all here on earth to learn from our mistakes and to be better, and I can imagine how many lessons you’ve taken from this. we love you and we are here for you ❤️
Why apologize?  You was pissed, felt disrespected,  and handled business. I hate the fake big word apology speech!
We love you Will!
Yeah 4 months after the fact he says he’s sorry. Come on man!
We still love you buddy
"It's been a minute" Now wonder why the hell that is??
You didn’t let me down.
You're human , we love you brother 🙏, keep walking forward
You need to get rid of that evil women your with. She's toxic! You're an amazing people mate. Really good role model for a lot of people.
chris should be the one making an apology video, you did nothing wrong for standing for your own family
Apology in person?
Stand up behavior. You can not fix the past but you are able to learn from it and grow.
I like Chris. I like Will. They both have more than enough good will with me to not make me care about stupid things they do. Sometimes people make mistakes. Thats ok. I dont agree with what they do, but its ok. I really hope the people involved in this gets to talk and make peace with each other.
cant wait to see the (youtube apology video reactions) mostly will be disses , but hear me out mistakes happen and i think he deserves forgiveness he made my childhood holy
Respect! Get jiggy wit it, Fresh Prince!
You have always had an impeccable reputation and one thing shouldn't take all that away. You're still a very upstanding man in my book. No that I'm anyone that matters.
i wish the best for you
Will you are human. All humans make mistakes. please stop being so hard on yourself. True your action was a little surprising but it's time to move on. you're a very sensitive guy and you're owning your mistake. But we still love and support you and all the goodness that you have given from  your heart. it's great to see you. all will be well soon. please take care of yourself. you were always in my prayers. this will pass. I support you 💯 because I'm one of your biggest fans. and please don't knock yourself out trying to please everyone cause it just ain't possible for anyone to do that. I love you. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
Shameful!!!! Rich people, don't live in reality!
You are an awesome human being! Keep your head up. To be human is to error. Let those without sin cast the first stone.
Disingenuous!
Gg
I can sympathize with the pressure that u go through on a daily basis so I’m not super surprised by what u did but we all make mistakes u do what u can to fix the issue and we can move on. Ur still an amazing talent and all around good person just keep at it.
You are a human. It was only a mistake.  You know that you're Love.
When you are about to start your school project but will smith uploads-
Will has always been an inspiration to me, especially since I grew up watching him since the fresh prince days. I hope the people accept your apology and we can let bygones be bygones.
Unpopular opinion I’m probably the only one that is upset about this video
Love you Will, we all make mistakes. Live and learn.
Cringe
No one cares
Sending love and positive energy your way. You are phenomenal. Every step in the journey has purpose. Don't try to carry the world on your shoulders...being human means people are going to get let down. We are more than the image people construct from their own view of us.
I still love you will, God loves you. Keep your head up, we all do stupid things in life that we have to live with, don't think your on your own, just have to live with, peace ✌️
We're all human and prone to human "stuff," you are, and forgiveness will be forthcoming.  You are still Loved.
Will, I want to let you know that I am not judging you on that mistake. In fact I'm not judging you at all, I'm a mere observer and what I see is a human being. You are like every one of us and boy did we do worse than you in so many moments in our lives. I hope people can see your honest heart. You don't deserve all this media pressure. I hope we can all grow up and forgive one another and express love to one another. Continue the great work! I hope I will see you soon on the big and small screen! Peace and love
I guess the job offers stopped coming in and now he has to do this to try and rectify the situation.    Pretty pathetic if you ask me...
Keep going Will!
❤️
i missed you bro.
We all make mistakes yours just happen to be televised and then put on replay all over the world.  It takes a real man to apply into apologize publicly because you could have done this behind closed doors so thank you for showing us how to correct your wrongs. Now be easy on yourself, forgive yourself and work on the 8 Steps of Atonement with Chris and your family.  THIS TOO SHALL PASS
Para Los Que Solo Somos Hablo Si Pana Que Que Dijo?
I love that Chris isn't ready to talk.  A call and an apology is not gonna erase the footage. A public humiliation of that magnitude isn't solved by "hey im sorry"
This required so much bravery and courage to be able to give your apology and not be too hard on yourself. Stay the course, do the work and all will be well. Sending an abundance of Love, Grace and kindness.
Если так хотелось извиниться, но надо было извиниться за своё поведение перед аудиторией и академией. А перед Крисом Роком никогда!
To me Will, you have to let go of others expectations. The greatest thing you can do is recover. That teaches human beings more than perfection. You are not defined my moments. You are forgiven, no condemnation or conviction. Dont let satan hold you bound by something God has already forgiven you for. Now it may take others longer but all you can do is what you did. You apologizing is foreign to much, Hollywood refuses admit it. Stand firm in who God created you and if people like you they like you...but what can they do? I cant wait to see how God blessing you because we have all been there...no matter how much we have twisted the story over the yrs...we have been there.
Es de caballeros valientes disculparse... Ya pasó, ya fresco... El futuro es más duro y necesitamos buenas vibras... Paz y respetos desde Ecuador 🇪🇨
The world needs you. Love you so much Will ❤️
Man will we don't care, it's them blogs
so cute will. I’m sure there’s still lots to unpack but such a good start. fan from bhutan 🇧🇹 pls come here to meditate or smth. I’ll guide ua
This is powerful for a lot of people Mr. Smith. We Thank you, we love you. Welcome back brother 💪🏾💯♥️
Good ole apology PR on its work. Expect him to show up in a multi pronged PR apology initiative.
I will always love you Will, in the end we are all human and deserve a second chance. Keep your head up 🙏🏽
He slipped up! I’m already over it.
We still friends Will.🥰
We Love you soo much Will Smith.  Thank you for all you go and the light you bring in to our lives.  Your energy and passion is next level.  WE GOT YO BACK!
You made a mistake... we all do...its just that most of us aren't on a public stage. I believe you are genuinely a good person who had a momentary lapse of judgement. Don't be too hard on yourself! You have brought so much to people through your music and acting that one lapse can't erase all that. I know you've been hurting over this. Wishing you comfort and that you forgive yourself ...sometimes we are harder on ourselves than others are. Stay strong and know you have support.
Will..you said you promise we will be friends again.  I can speak for my husband and family and say you NEVER lost our friendship.  I know you will continue to bring life, love and joy to the world.  You are human.  We make mistakes.  I forgave you a long time ago.  I appreciate this video and this  does help us and help you with your process of healing and forgiving yourself.  Please know we are still and will always be with you.  Much love!!
No disrespect love you Will I felt like there wasn't enough explanation or not enough questions answered. I feel like like this is a precursor to a red table talk.
We still love you, we grew up with you. Nobody is perfect. God has the last say so
Looks like somebody can’t find work.
Wait... ppl actually cared abt this? I thought this was viewed as a meme lol. Brave of u Will❤️
Your a Remarkable man will,it Takes alot to Apologise,we forgive you.
When we were kids we would fight our friends but come back the next day and we would shake hands and be friends again...this can be fixed..
If no one died, anything can be repaired. If black people can forgive white people for their past transgressions, this situation can be a cake walk if BOTH parties want a genuine repair.
damn this is insane a response finally.....
I hear you.
Will, I been watching you since I was a kid, I'm now 34 and to be honest,  nothing has changed my opinion about you. Your an outstanding individual with a great heart and a passion to bring joy and laughs to everyone.    Your actions may not have been acceptable, however given from what I read in your book and piecing together what loved about you as I grew up. I understand, and for you to post this video makes you an even bigger role model in my eye than before.
No one is without sin. Look in the mirror before you judge.
Thank you for answering the most burning questions. I was confused and hurt by your act but I am listening, want to forgive and get back to being friends
I still love you!!
It's ok, everyone makes mistakes
U made a mistake and I’m glad to see you apologize to Chris. ❤️u Will I still a fan.
You are a very brave man to express your emotions.  I appreciate you for being open and honest with all of us. Thank you!  ❤️🙏🏻 to you.
Still a real OG ,goat 🙌
This is a healing process & don't be hard on yourself brother; this will come to pass. Many of us look up to you brother. ❤
Bless you, Will! Praying you continue to heal and know a lot of people love you and not just your work product. You are enough and you don't have to live up to others standards of you. You are a human being (learning, and growing and making mistakes)  like all of us and that means you will rise and fall and rise again. Take good care and be well!
Just an incredibly fake human being, and maybe being a child actor this is just the end result when you're 50 years old surrounded by yes men your entire life, nothing is real, every revelation is just acting how he thinks someone would if movies were real
Will Smith in simple words has tried to be the model of a perfect man standards that were placed on him ppl make mistakes no one's perfect we live and learn  Edit: I made this comment before starting the vid making what I said even stronger I'm glad he was honest
Cam we all just take a minute to give will  props for this? It must have been hard to go on camera and say all this without busting into any kind of spiral.
You're always been the best in my eyes!   Sending love from South Carolina ❣️❣️💋
You´re the best! Be strong!
Wil, I can understand this better now, I was shocked as it was a bit out of left field, beating yourself up over something done the wrong way does nothing but make it worse. I am glad you have taken this as an opportunity to grow. Chris and you go way back I hope that he can see his way to having a sit down and talk with you
we all have to remind that you are a human being, so you can make a mistake, i was waiting your come back and finally you show your humility. im with you bro
good to see you back
Will, We always be on Your Side. No matter how much they hate you. We never let you down.
Love you!! You have shared your soul with us as always. Virtual hug 🥹🙏🏾💜
People make mistakes all the time,but never look at themselves,they're like ok I will never do it again. People have friends whom have made a mistake but stuck beside them,because they know their friend is a good person. If someone else does the same thing for another,people quickly turn their back on them forever. Hopefully some good people out there will understand and learn forgiveness 🙏🏿
Real ones still love u man ...
We all make mistakes in life no one is perfect there are things we all wish we could take back but the best thing is to apologize and be sensitive to all involved and give it time.  You are still Loved and a big deal in our world. Much love
I AM HAPPY U ARE DOING WELL MR. WILL SMITH AND HOPE TO SEE U AGAIN SOON.  #BADBOYZ4
Is okay to not be alright at some point, that’s just how life is!!! Good to hear you back Man.
We love you, Will. In all the years that you have graced our screens, this was the first time we've seen this side of you. It wasn't right, but it happened. I don't think it's cause to shut you out. 🤎
Welcome back 🙏🏼 you are way too good for narcissist around you. You need to get divorced, stop torturing your brain with all the apology you have to give to everyone, stop dating narcissists. Never forget that we love u 💖
Will I'm still rockin with you and you don't have to apologize to us only the people that were involved. I love you Mr. Smith
It’s crazy how security didn’t stop him from going on stage. That to me is what made it seemed like it was a planned act 🤷🏻‍♂️
Cringe
This gives me flashbacks of @deji apologies videos 😂
Nothing can take away the talent you have given us for decades. A true I am Legend.
You are human.  No one can expect you to perfect.  Thank you for addressing this and taking accountability.  Your fans (myself included) will stand behind you and support as you take this journey.
Will Smith you’re my favorite actor🔥
I still love you !!!! We all make mistakes it’s what you learn from it to make you better!! Your still amazing!!
God Bless you Will
I love you and your family.
I am really happy about this message and I hope Chris will be able to forgive and his family also hope the people will also see your point of view ✌️
You are a great man we will always love you.
King Willie is back!
Where did you get these questions
It has been.   Sometimes reflecting and understanding is more needed than anything else. Keep your momentum and keep pushing.   Taking accountability is all that matters.   Big blessings. Stay safe, stay wise, stay thankful.
Love Will Smith...
Deadshot don’t miss
several months too late at this point
Before I even watch, I love you and still think nothing but highly of you!
Keep your head up bro. We are all only human. We except you as you are.
Who framed this interview?  It's like his head is much bigger and rounder than it should be with that lamp precicely behind his hat of almost the same color.
Oh will I understand what you did I really do we are only human hope you and Chris are able to talk you are a brilliant actor and a really nice person 😊  love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Love the production
God bless you will,yes ur right ur just a human thats why we can commit a mistakes in life atleast all those mistakes u do u can learn from it....we love you and stay safe always
So proud of you for doing this..
Much love Will! Stay strong dude! A mistake doesn't define you. Can't wait to see you making movies again.  GOOD BOYS FOR LIFE!!!
We still love you Will
You did something stupid, but I'm still a fan.
👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽Thank you again for being so vulnerable💔😢NO ONE should EVER have to live in shame. Guilt is healthy because it gauges the moral compass. Whereas shame, devalues a human. And your value, Will, can NEVER be stripped away. It’s not ours to determine. You are not a SUPER human. Shame OFF you🙏🏽🫶🏽🙏🏽 PEACE ☮️ LOVE ❤️
I think you've come apon some hard times a lot has happened but stay strong always enjoyed your movies etc. You are a great person i just think some things have thrown you off the path you normally walk
No sweat bro...we are ALL FLAWED IN MAKE BAD MOVES. IM A SUPPORTER SO YOU KNOW MY VIBES. 💪🏽✊🏽✌🏽🙏🏽🤎✔️
we all missed you legend
Nobody is perfect. You seem humble and contrite in your response. Even a man of peace and positivity can make a mistake.   Let this be a learning and a teaching moment in your life.
Will, it's good you did this.....it was needed.
Will, you've always been a class act. Your acknowledgement, accountability and apology is appreciated.
Tranquilo hermano, muchos de nosotros hubiésemos relacionado igual, y con esto, no te digo que estuvo bien o mal, lo que si te digo es NO ESTÁS SÓLO, como todos eres un ser humano que puede cometer errores, sigues siendo y serás para mí y millones en el mundo, un modelo a seguir, cuídate y que Dios te bendiga.  Con mucho cariño, Jorge Carvajal, otro ser humano.
W for Will <3
❤️❤️❤️
Bruh! You’re done. Just accept it. You made a decision. I would’ve done the same thing but who tf am I? You’re a legend and should’ve been on your P’s and Q’s and been the better man. Sometimes we gotta take an L and after years of success… this is your moment.
WE LOVE YOU.  PERIOD!!!! ❤️
No1 is perfect. But a man that can admit and apologise is the strongest kind of man and role model
Love and supoort form Peru
Word. Peace and Love. Mr. Smith 🙏🏾👁✌🏾❤
Legend no matter what. Always. ❤️
We still love you Sir Will, your character as a man has been STELLAR for DECADES !  We all make mistakes in this human journey, please continue to take loving and gentle care of yourself. Glad you have reached out to Chris and have apologized to his family and your family and the world.  Keep moving forward, we need you bruh !
Just relax and please yourself every once in a while 👍
This was hard to get through. Even though Will wasn't very strategic with his response to Chris, the over dramatics of the incident is so Hollywood.
We are all human and we all make mistakes, everyone deserves a second chance you are a really great person and you are very talented very special and you love making people happy, just keep spreading the love and that is all that matters 🙌🏻
A lot of people still look up to you!! You made a mistake you understand maybe not the best way but your fixing it. Your only human and people need to understand that. We all make mistakes. Your still the the best!!!
Keep going Will 🐐
Before people discredit Will. We’re all humans, we all make mistakes and we should always hold ourselves accountable. Sometimes our actions speak louder than our words. In the current state of the world, healing and finding peace within ourselves will solve a lot of our internal issues.  We love you Will Smith. This is the time for healing
A time off..a break...we humans need it as many times as possible  We love you Will..always🤍
I think you don't need to apologize for anything for doing the right thing, I glad you come back strong Will, stay strong ✊
ОГО. НЕ УСПЕЛА НА ПРЯМОЙ ЭФИР.  ПРИЯТНО УДИВЛЕНА, СТОЛЬКО ВРЕМЕНИ ВАС НЕ БЫЛО.  ПЕРЕВОД СДЕЛАЙТЕ НА РУССКИЙ ЯЗ. У ВАС МНОГО ПОДПИСЧИКОВ РУССКИХ...
👏🏽🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏽You are definitely human and are allowed a moment, you have always shown compassion ❤️ and restraint throughout your career, you are allowed a moment, we all have had them, let's get you back to making some awesome movies 🎬 🤗
Hey We still love you forever Will..     EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES!!!!
I stand by will.
Who would have ever thought that we’d be seeing Will Smith do the classic Youtuber sit down apology video!! 😂
I'm glad you Did this Will, now hopefully people can see your deep hurt. And know that as long as we live on this world 🌍 we're going to make mistakes. I forgive you Will. And I pray that the world will also 💘💪🏾🙏🏾
Ahahahahahahahaah
I’ll say this as well. And not to bring up anything old. But it’s relevant in a sense. Chris Brown one of my favorite artist, and a talented artist 🎨. Love the guy. But if we can forgive him and his situation/mistake. This should be easy for everyone to look pass and forgive. Just saying!🤷🏽‍♂️
🐐
It takes a real man to own up to their mistakes! Great job Will!
What a legend
I believe your apology. I believe you have genuine remorse for how that went down and I’m of the opinion that we are more than our worst moments. You had a human moment as we all do in life, anyone who says they don’t is either delusional or hasn’t experienced enough of life’s peaks and valleys to have a complete view of it. It’s not up to me or any of us to forgive you, that’s between you and Chris. But, I for one believe in the power of growth and healing with time. In the end, for all of us, eventually….everything is gonna be alright.
look it's a butterfly
We all make mistakes no one and I mean no one on this earth is perfect. There was only one perfect man and that's Jesus Christ himself. I have been praying for you every since that night. We love you and is here for you always. God bless you and your entire family.
We love you Will! We miss you and welcome back!!! Now let’s get back to work!! 🙌🏾👏🏾💪🏾♥️
You are an incredible MAN!  ✨✨✨The shame, the doubt, the sadness, the mourning, the fear, the confusion, the hurt, the vulnerability … Will Smith,  these are our           HUMAN TRAITS.  And  when we walk through those emotions with accountability, like you have just shown; the lesson you share is indomitable GRACE.     I am proud to call you- as a person I admire… still.  I knew you would teach me a lesson in this moment.  Anyone  else?  That’s none of our business!!!!!  God Bless you & your family.🙏🏾♥️💯
Will, blink twice and we'll get you out of there
Hey man, take your time and get better, we are all here waiting for you buddy. Hugs 😊☺️
We r all human n we all f up sometimes its life, learn n move on
You didn’t need to do this, we all react how we feel is necessary. It’s also old we forgot, WILL☝🏽
Biggest unanswered question: why did you do it? And would you have done it if it was a white person?
Thanks Will for making this video. I was personally hurt in my heart when it happened. We will all heal and become better people.  We are all praying that everyone will heal and forgive and come back as a family again.
You don't have to live up to OUR IMAGE OF WHO WE WANT YOU TO BE, just be the best version of yourself you know right from wrong, we all make mistakes perfection is a good goal i guess but very much so an impossible one
We know people been on your neck about being soft but dont let that get to you ,sometimes things just happen
You apologized Move On Forgive Yourself now.💕🎁
My hope for you, Will, is that you are surrounded by love. The people you hurt - they have love of all varieties to see them through life's pain, and they have the positive opinions/sentiments of the court of public opinion to shore-up and support that love. The saddest part of being on your side of 'the incident' is the collective weight of disappointment you wear, with the heaviest part of that being the hair shirt of your own disappointments in yourself. My hope is that you can forgive yourself. While you make your contrition to those whom you've hurt, hold fast to the courage it takes to keep moving forward. If you do, I promise: that movement forward plus tincture of time will eventually being healing, for you and everyone else. You may not get a chance with some people - there may be no road back to some of those whom you've lost along the way - but you won't lose everyone, and those relationships will be stronger for having weathered these times.
You were missed, everyone makes mistakes. Don't be too hard on yourself. Welcome back
Life will takes time to self realisation
I think every human makes mistakes, but not every gets watched by Millions of people... I think everything should be fine now.
I'm hanging on, Will. For the record, I never let go. Day 1 fan. Who among us hasn't made mistakes? This man has had to listen to all kinds of ugly rumors, speculation, and insults for decades and, do it, with a smile. I can only imagine how much trauma and anger he's had built up inside. Will didn't do anything he shouldn't be forgiven for.
FOREVER ONE LOVE WILL
I've been a fan since day 1 and will continue to be fan. You had a laps in judgment just like any human. You are allowed to be human. I love you Will.
We love you will,this must have been hard to do❤
Pues mi opinion es que si tu cometiste un error el otro tambien tu ya te as disculpado nose por que el otro se sigue asiendo la víctima. Te amo Will
What a guy.
Thank you Mr. Smith. It’s good seeing you.
Sending healing energy and light to you 💛
Will I'm not going anywhere. Dante velez will never leave team will
Will ..Respect my brother,you have my support 100% peace&blessing
We love and miss you Will!!! All love 🧡
WILL , so amazing to see you. We are still here by your side and standing with you through all of this. I hope you’re okay.
Being a human is normal.
OK so you did what you did no big deal you smack  some one boo woo it could have been worse  don't trip will your still a grate actor  and it don't take away from your acting skill and what you have done
Still one of the greats and my favorite actor. 👍🏾👍🏾
The way I see it, you made a mistake; we’re human. You’ve apologized. It’s time for the world to move on, and not live in the past. Time is to short to focus on nonsense.
Damn even will smith doing YouTube apologies
Will you are forgiven.
Mr Smith I really appreciate this video. I hope everything is going to be allright for you.
There has to be a part 2.  This was to short and there is so many unanswered questions!
Love you forever Will ❤ This doesn't diminish all the incredible things you have accomplished, the impact you've had on music and TV/film, and the ways you've shifted the culture forward. You're still a legend, still the Fresh Prince who became a King, and still worthy of love.
Beautiful apology. He's human. Let that sink in people.
I just want the skincare routine.
Come on Will, its over You already did the right thing
🦍✊🏿Bumpin Straight but it’s up to 🪶👑Chris Tho.💕
🖤🙏🏾🖤
No one on this planet hasn’t fucked up massively before. Keep grinding, keep shining, and we hope to see the positivity you are advocating for!
Victim card declined
One mistake, doesn't erase a lifetime of inspiration. Your real fans still love you!
Sir...Welcome back ♥️♥️♥️. Love Uuu...
Light and love to you and your family Will... I pray you find your breakthrough in the midst of this storm... 🙏 🙌
:)
I still look up to you Uncle Will, even more so now than before. Imperfection and suffering is the human condition and we all make mistakes. The only difference is some will learn from it, and others will run from it. My parents had unhealed trauma and in turn hurt and traumatized me in ways that I am still healing and learning from. NO ONE IS PERFECT all we can do is move forward and allow ourselves the grace to make mistakes and move forward with what it’s taught us. Love you Uncle Will ❤️
What’s this all about what happened
Here before MoistCr1tikal makes a video about this...
"It's been a minute..." oh my god that's a funny title!
To make mistakes _- sometimes horrible, AWFUL mistakes -_ is human To learn from them, to actually change as a person, is evolution
This apology seems very genuine!!!
We still love you Will. Period
Where is the apology to Quest Love? A black man who won for best documentary had his much deserved moment taken because of this.
We are with you... 💚💚💚
One more album
Will you're still simply the best.
Interesting.
You should have kept  your excuse in private with the persons involved  and not share it al in the open. Now you keep dragging your stupid mistake around for all to see when you need to go on with your life. This is not our problem nor the rest of the world, this is your problem and the people you hurt.
❤️✊
Boy you can’t talk about something else
Hey Will💞💕 I've been praying and waiting on you☺️!!! I've also wanted to give you the BIGGEST HUG EVER!!! ARE YOU READY? HERE GOES 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 I am so glad you're ok and that you have been working on self development and healing💫⭐✨ Remember, at some point in life or death we all may need to be forgiven. The most wonderful thing about saying "I APOLOGIZE" is having the BREATH OF LIFE to do so. You have always been my favorite.  The Bible says " When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom."  Proverbs 11:2.   Love you Will!!! Oh wait...One more hug before I go🤗
dude got me in my feelz….
We love you, Will. Always pulling for you.
Ser una celebridad no te hace un ser humano sin sentimientos o no espero que no cometas errores. Estoy orgullosa de ti y de que puedas aceptarlo y de disculparte. Love you Will. Te extrañe mucho.
We are still friends Will!! Mistakes happen- how you handle them afterwards is everything!! I got you!!!!
Still Love you Mr. Will Smith
But I really enjoyed the memes.
I still don't understand why he's still with that toxic woman, she never seemed to love him,his kids are all grown he can leave her and find someone who truly loves him and didn't ruin him, he's still too good for her
you're brave Will  <3
So badly want a one on one video with Will and Chris, just to see them talk it out would be great!
Hope India gave him a ray of hope to live peacefully 🙏
Humanity is coloured in imperfections. Most people could see through all of this. Thank you for being all that you are...for being human | xoxo
I felt this was a really heartfelt apology. He really went away & did the work & came back ready to face it head on. 👍
I'm with you Will. A brother makes one misstep and they try to tear down his whole career. You've always been an example of excellence to me. I'm still a supporter.
👏🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾🤲🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good on you Will. Continue to work on yourself, and you've taken a big step by doing this. Always been a fan, but we all make mistakes sometimes. But we all deserve to be better and to be forgiven.
Sorry Will. You’ve shown what type of man you are… I’m not feelin this.
God bless you Will, this situation is part of the large tapestry called your destiny. All things work together to form us and teach us. Praying for you!
❤️ it’s ok Will we are all human ❤️
I still love this man. You can clearly see by his face how much he is hurting. Sending love to you. I am very proud of you for rising above all the bullies. 🙏🙏❤️❤️🥰🥰😘
Reminds Of Good Times When JAMES Was soooul mad at his friend and he apologized and JAMES did forgive him.🪶👑Bro.
Way to GO🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
This was very genuine. Everyone deserves redemption. You made a mistake and owned it. That’s growth. We still love you. 🥰💚🥰
THE GOAT
Will always love you, Big Will! My favorite actor of all time.
You don't owe anyone anything. Forgive yourself & let it go. 🙂✌
Claim your here before the millions
people makes mistake...its part of living..learn and move forward..
You are not your mistake. The one who gave you life, purpose, and destiny is not disappointed. You are fully loved. Rest in God. You will never find it in the opinion of others.
Love you, Will <3
Do black media 1st will that is the only thing I would add. Budden, MEO, doggie diamonds,urban x, before you boost these major networks and platforms breakfast club don't count charla would be a lap dog. No thanks praying for you bruh. You got your people still
Will,  you know we your true fans love you dearly and wish only the best for you. But was that read off a teleprompter???
Will, I 💓you! That moment was def a growth incident. You have taken ownership of it and you have apologized for it... Now, it's time to gently keep it moving. You will always be a stellar human being! Once again, I 💓 you!
I can say right now. Actions speak louder than words. If you actually mean these things that you say, and you are actually looking to give light and love back into the world... then I'm all here for it.  I love you Will. And I know I'm just a fan.... but! I'm one of those fans that kinda grew up with you.... watching fresh prince, watching your movies... mib, hitch, i robot, pursuit of happiness.... etc.  When Robin Williams passed away, i cried. I sobbed. In that moment of hearing about it. I was saddened. It felt like losing a family member...  so you could imagine how disheartening it was watching what happened....  I hope you do change. I hope you do the things you mentioned. Still a fan.
Sending love, light and healing energy to everyone involved! Take your time Will 🤞🏽❤️‼️
Here before this video gets millions of views
Nothing to apologise for in my opinion,  these stand up comedians are getting a little too cocky as of late, it's not good comedy to just insult people
Still my guy. After reading your book, I’m not shocked this happened. Your biggest moments all have clouds over them.
You’ve never lost me as a friend! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
there are so many ppl in hollywood that have done way worse than you have and they haven’t apologized for any of it. everyone needs to be happy you are not the actual monster that they tried to make you out to be! I have always known that, ONE big mistake in your 30 year career does not define you. I hope we all can put this past us and move on.
I love you Will  💛
Worst bottled water ad ever
This makes me so happy thank u for coming back willll👑👑👑👑
I am here to support you brother! Stay Strong!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👑🙏🏽❤ ur forgiven William.
Wow
Hey man, every man makes mistakes, you are a great man because you recognised it. Don't worry, I hope Chris are going to talk with you again soon
You are not easily disposable to us ❤️
“We all make mistakes sometimes and we all step across the line but nothing’s sweeter than the day we find forgiveness” Toby Mac…. I’ve always liked Will Smith, he made a mistake and he is remorseful for what he did. I pray Chris and his family and everybody forgives Will.
I'm really glad you made this video. I'm glad you were man enough to be open with your feelings. We truly do love you and when you truly love people you forgive them. So don't worry and don't beat urself because ur only human. I hope u and Chris can work it out because we love BOTH of you. We need BOTH of you. It's sad to say but I feel like since this has happen it makes u a even better rile model because it's shows ur not perfect and it's okay to have things to work on. Ur forver our Fresh Prince!! Love Ya!!!
I’m fine with this. Good job will
KEEP YOUR MOUTH OUT OF MY NOTIFICATIONS
He deserved it but it takes a real man to apologise
💗
Hope you will be back
Hmmm
*We Love You Will*
I miss you Idol🥺🖤
Man I'm cheering for you to push through this. hope all the best for you ....
We accept ur apology a wife’s love is a powerful thang and sum men wouldn’t did that! But one ☝🏽 good thang u did helped Chris with is raise his ticket sales that weekend 10 million in a week! Keep ur head up brother and god bless! God forgive you! We have all fallen more than one time no man perfect
Bs!
You’re human and we make mistakes. Nice to see you back
Stop the act!
💞
Best actor of all time. Great Rapper. Will did the right thing. No need to apologize.
It’s sad to me that he ruined his night, THAT WAS HE’S NIGHT! Now the only thing that Will can do is to amend his past errors in the present, because we are all humans in the end, but be careful because life does not always give second chances, make it worth
Still my role model! You’re an amazing human being and this mistake can’t change that. Much love
It's alright bro, you made a mistake and I know you and Chris will come around to being good friends again. Both you guys, take your time to heal and when you're ready, bring us that new Bad Boys, we'll come out to see it.
I respect that he is owning his mistake and apologising to Chris.
👍🏽👏🏽🤝🏽🙌🏽
Tie your shoes
Wish him the best, sincerly a good intentioned man.
Всё это полная фигня! Тебе не за что извиняться Уил! Ты всё правильно сделал!
Will, A lot of people have made decisions in the heat of the moment that they later regret. Just like you said, "you are human." Keep in mind But for the grace of God, there go I. Hopefully your apology will be accepted because no one in this world is perfect and we all make mistakes.  Sending you love and wishing you peace. ❤
Love you Will
will used to be a big role model of mine but he rly fell down a spiral I pray he's doing good and is happy
People make mistakes. This man has been in the spotlight for numerous years, people don’t let 1 mistake tarnish his lifetime of work.
We love u Will! 🙏🏾
You are not a piece of crap. You are loved, cared for, talented, courageous, remarkable and a legend. You made a mistake. We all make mistakes and do things on impulse without thinking about the repercussions. Get out your head and move on. Continue to make phenomenal movies and make people laugh. You are needed on this earth in this lifetime and the next. May God cover you and the Angels heal all areas that seek healing. Many Blessings ✨️💫🙏🏾🧿
Genuinely seem remorseful here Will... I hope those around you that matter in your life accept and can move forward..   heat of the moment, we all do things we regret.... and no-one should be shunned forever
Thank you for that, Will. We're all human. It's important to acknowledge when we fall; even more important to get back up.
Welcome back Will. ❤️
You've been an important artist in my life since Parents Just Don't Understand all the way to Bad Boys for Life and I have really appreciated your YouTube posts over the years especially the posts about writing your book and processing your childhood.  My heart broke for you when you buckled emotionally in the most climactic moment of your career.  I felt bad for Chris, but I knew that for you to do something like that in that moment meant that you were going through something serious.  I remember facing what I went through as a child and when you were that sweet fun kid to get through it, facing it decades later suddenly brings out all of the pain and anger and regret and guilt and shame and it's just overwhelming.  And you find yourself having to find a new balance of self control as you let those feelings out, because you've spent a lifetime avoiding them, so, you really don't know how to moderate them.  I don't really know you, but I love you, man.  I'm rooting for you.  I'll always be appreciative and proud of everything you've done as an artist and as a person hoping to inspire other people to live as good of a life as possible. Don't go anywhere.  I look forward to decades more of you as an artist and an inspiration.
Once again, it shows how big and strong of a human being you are, sir! Admitting his wrongdoings are probably one of the hardest things to do and you did it like man, sir! Keep your head high and keep inspiring us please.  Peace !
I love ya Will walk with head held high my brother! I support you!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good to see you Will. I missed you. 🥰
Will u didn’t nothing wrong u in ur emotions no one should be made to feel like you did anything wrong. Keep u head up ppl too damn soft and forget ur are human too. Keep ur head up will you are not bad person don’t let anyone or self think that
Well done! 😍 We still love you!
We still love you Will. No one is perfect and make all the right decisions. We all have something we wish we could go back and do again. You live and you learn. As you said we are all HUMAN. ❤
Rich man who wants people to forgive him so he can make even more money.. How about do something else with your life than try to win fans back?  Your family lives like royalty, you don't need to constantly be liked to do something positive.
We love you Will
❤️ Will .
We love you Will… you didn’t let us down…it was just a moment, continue to heal Will
💥Lots of Love I know god Forgives us for our mistakes & we forgive you too !!! ❤❤❤🥰😍😍Remember to Forgive Yourself ‼‼‼‼‼
Always a fan and will always have love for you Will. I understand after so many conversations, therapy, and time that you were triggered. You can be remorseful and not tear yourself down in the process. Happy to see you acknowledge that. This is only a short moment in time and everything will work itself out. God bless you.
It's a start. 😊
Will, Your real family and friends are here in the comments and surround you! Take solace in knowing they know this mistake doesn't define you as a man and it takes a man to humble himself and accept accountability for what he has done. We love you! Praying for healing for both you and Chris and maybe one day you two can grow and move on together from this. Stay up Big Bro!!
We are all human and having a breaking point. It was the way you handled something because that's how you were used to. It's ok to not be ok and it's even better to acknowledge the wrong doing. That's the first step to healing. God be with you Always!!!
Will Smith you the goat period
After you f*ck up, you get up, you look up up, you straighten up, and you fess up all while you continue to work through your error. Keep moving forward and shine on.
Hey Will glad to see you’re doing better. Everything will be alright no matter what’s going on. 👍
I can't believe how just because this guy is a 'celebrity' everyone is so quick to forgive. The guy doesn't even know you exist - you all need to get a grip.
Peace and Love for all
Happy Friday! It's great to see you are back.   Even on your worse day, you are far better than many of us.   Keep doing the best that YOU can.  I tried on your army boots and had to take them off at being accepted into MIT.  I am still waiting to see if Alabama State will accept me! LOL!    I can never "call" your game.  If it wasn't for my Harvard Statistics class I would still be struggling with my relationships... when I added the numbers of all the disrespect, hate, and envy  - then subtracted my love and concern for them = it was easy to modify my (MY) reactions, responses, and interactions.  I have never felt so free in my life because the second-guessing is GONE.   --- One Love, Black Excellence.
Good that apologies
Welcome back, Will. I believe you wholeheartedly. Don't apologize anymore after this. Keep moving forward and continue to work on yourself
Good looking you a man doing what a man supposed to do taking account for what happened you are the goat you and him will make things right
I have only love for you, perfection is transhistoric and profoundly universal. It is an illusion for people to give themselves meaning in life. Perfection is impossible.
My boy that’s what we need , you are human and make mistakes . This is what Real stand up people do !!!! Admit , work on it and Show the people that you can slip and get back up !! Everyone has had a lost ugly moment . Unite never Divide 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💯💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️💪🏾
Is this really the first time you've apologized?
Nothing changed for me after that day Will I still love your work .  You did what you had to do at that moment.  Its really sad that today in 2022 we can’t be ourselves we have to act according to someone else wants is to act like otherwise WE ARE WRONG
Well I just hope things go back the way they used to be before the incident.
All love Will, we all make mistakes.
Thank you for these words and putting yourself out there like this and not making excuses for the actions that were taken. I respect you for putting this out there
🦍✊🏿ADOS Tangible Lineage Reparations Indigenous NegrosColored BlackIndians Native Blacks Of The Americas LandGiveBack 📣🪶👑Bro.
This was honestly big of him to admit he was wrong and apologise. Probably the first time I've ever believed any celebrity's apology as genuine. Hope Chris forgives him, I have a feeling he will, and they rebuild their friendship again.
This is gonna go viral!! 😂
Get that toxic woman out yo life bro
If I could hug You I would. The only thing I can do is to say or rather write: Breakdowns happen to everyone. As You once said You have to fail to better Yourself. Mr. Smith I deeply respect You.
I am black franch personne and a want ro tell you to be and stay strong because you are Lighthouse of many black people. Just  "Go ahead".
Twelve years ago now, I gave Will as name to my son. I was proud at the time exactly I am now. 🙏
The problem is really the relationship you're in. You can't stay with someone like that and be okay.  The most self-loving thing you can do is break up sometimes. I wish you could see that.
I respect the accountability for your actions
He accepted accountability and addressed the person he actually hurt! Here he was Concise, straight to the point, and focused on what the issue is! No running or negating from the obvious! He’s giving Chris the room and apology to begin healing and acknowledged he was wrong! I respect it! ❤️
We still love you Will. ❤️
Big Willie style 👍🎯
I supremely hope that things will get better for you and Chris
Praying for all, 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 and that everyone will  stop condemning a mistake as we all are human and have made a mistake big & small. Praying that forgiveness will prevail and this unfortunate moment can finally be left in the past.  Let healing be done. 🙏🏽 Continued Blessings 🙏🏽💜
Sh_t happens it suck’s but hey you apologized and that’s life always will support you much love and respect Will always
We missed you! Hindsight is always 2020. Shake it off.  You are two great black men. Yall will get through this. You both will heal.
🖤
STRONG MY FRIEND, WE ARE WITH YOU, STRENGTHEN CHRIS YOU ARE THE BEST WE LOVE YOU TOGETHER! 😊🤗✌ 🇧🇷
We all know the mental baggage you deal with my friend. Stuff happens brush it off and keep it pushing
🤝🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽
Forever a fan of this brother and like I told someone Will ain’t did nothing to me
I used to respect you man
You're forgiven ❤️
U can still he is not reading anything apart from the questions. He is saying wut he is thinking and that's not a bad thing at all ❤️
Yo Big Will! Time to drink Ayahuasca! If it scares you DO IT! You won't regret it!
Hi Will ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I wish the best for both you and Chris. Both of you are my favorites and the situation isn’t acceptable but I know that’s not you even though I don’t know you. Much love.
You are Hero, you are great
We make all mistakes. You are taking accountability for your choices. It's just because you are public figure and it makes it 1000 times worse. You are not a bad person, you just made a bad choice. It will get better. You asked for  forgiveness and so the ball is in other court for the person who wants to receive it.
I still love Will, he's human; not perfect.
One dark moment shouldn’t erase all the light and happy moments shared… Human beings make mistakes… Much respect to Will! 🫡  I pray he rise above this! And pray that everyone affected especially Chris and his family to heal from this.
WE LOVE YOU. You ARE good. DO better and everything will be alright.
Loads of love Will Smith.. I felt bad when u did that.. but this video made me happy... You're our Will afterall.. you're truly sorry.. Loads of love from India ❤️
We love you Will!
WE ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY! Let’s move on! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hola Will, el pasado no se puede cambiar! Solo se aprende! Se aprenden cosas buenas y malas!! Ya sufriste con una mala descision, ya lloraste, ya pasó!!¡! Ahora sacudete y sigue adelante! Adelante con lo que tienes! No con lo que no tienes! Perdónate tu y sigue caminando! Tú eres responsable de tus actos no eres responsable de los actos de los demás! Perdónate tú!! Acá en México un cachetadón no es nada! Venga a México va a ver cómo lo queremos acá!! Es más te aman en todo el mundo!! Ya brinca ese problema Y echa pa delante!! La vida solo es una !! y no vas a pasartela pidiendo perdón por un incidente que tiene el tamaño que tú quieras darle! Es más te digo una cosa si hoy murieras, Cris te perdonaba pero de que te serviría ese perdón? Vive la vida qué es muy corta!! Hay una fábula que habla de que todos los seres humanos tenemos dos lobos dentro! Uno bueno y uno malo! Y todos los días los alimentamos! El lobo malo tiene todos los defectos habidos y por haber! Y el lobo bueno tiene todas las virtudes habidas y por haber, piensa que lobo quieres alimentar para que continúe contigo tu camino!!  Te amamos!! Eres un fregón!! Vive! No te olvides de vivir! Los malos momentos solo te pueden dañar unos momentos!! no permitas que dañen toda tu vida!!besotes!!
Y’all can really change our culture within the healing of this! Straight up … I love y’all both… y’all are our legends 💫 know this
You’re human. You deserve forgiveness. We all make mistakes. Just because you are who you are doesn’t make it fair for people to crucify you.
Dude everyone has a mad moment ur only human we are still behind u 900 %
All our supports with you man  Love you fore ever
You did nothing wrong, bro.
Stuff happens bro. You’re human I’m human. Let the one without sin throw the first stone.
Will did nothing wrong.
Hard to forget that this guy is professional actor, hard to know what's real.
I appretiate the apologies, i appretiate the not crying exagerating, i think im still hurt and disapointed, i dont like the "all white influencer apology clothing and background" but i understand image is as or more important than message in this cases. I really hope we all can learn to say "i did wrong, here is why, ill do my best not to repeat it" im doing it, im working in it and is hard This is not a critic, is my feelings and opinion with it. be respectfull.
You're still one of my favorite actors man what happened was messed up and wrong but it was also human I KNOW it showed me that how human actors with such caliber such as yourself can really be
Will you’re forgiven by God as you continue this process please forgive yourself and free yourself . You’re human  reacted off emotion . Taking accountability and apologizing and now taking the time to heal . You’re on the right track. We are not meant to be perfect I know as a celebrity you have an image to uphold but that’s a lot of pressure for a human being to “put on” all time. I pray for your peace and that you’ll find your joy again. Shalom
I’m glad you finally opened up and apologized but I hope you are getting the help you need.
👀
YouTube apology video.... now you're really part of community. Welcome! Keep being human.
Will, what is happening? You sound so robotic. Anyway, don't beat yourself too hard. You are a great man. You did wrong with that but it is nice that you realized your mistake.
I LOVE YOU WILL!!!! ❤️
YES IT HAS I HOPE YOU ARE WELLLLLLL😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🤞🤞🤞
Love you ❤️ we all make mistakes, at least you admitted it
Todo el mundo comete errores. La grandeza de una persona está en saber rectificar. ♥️
we love you Will you are human. Take it easy. Dont be so hard on yourself.
We still LOVE you, Will! Always Will! No pun intended 🥰❤️. You will never lose your star power! Don't ever think that, sir! God bless You! Take whatever time you need and please, get back to work when you can! We miss YOU!😍😍😍😍😍
Literally went to your IG page yesterday bc I was like "where's will?"
Smart to release it on a Friday lol  You good Will …..hope you get everything straightened out, nice to apologize and get all this under the bridge    And make I am Legend 2…sorry had to
Todo el mundo comete errores. La grandeza de una persona está en saber rectificar. ♥️
your amazing person
I feel so proud of Will for this. It takes strength to apologize fr. I'm really crying tho.
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone. Exactly. Nobody is perfect. Proud of you Will.
A Good Step in the right direction. I would say that shame in oneself (as you said you did not want to do) is different than shame in one's actions, as a point in time.  The quality of one's character is not shown at their highest moment, and maybe not shown in a brief moment in time.  But It shows when you are down (and TBH you're still on top of the world in many ways, that many will never be!) and what you do next.  I'm hopeful that there can be good out of this, in the end.
Why everyone apologize on YouTube?😂
I respect you so much more ✨ Keep going 🤍
What you did was right and what you have just done is right too hope everyone understands 🙏 👌
Better late than never lol
I’m still with you Will!!! You are not perfect we are all imperfect and that’s what makes us special!!!
Ubuntu✊
Where is an answer to "was that real or staged?"
With as good of an actor he is... I needed to see end of a "Pursuit of Happyness" cry or something vs "After Earth" emotions. Felt like his grammy speech was clear then, and more tears 🤔
Everyone loves a redemption story!
We are all humans, realize your mistake, own it, apologize,  keep on walking!  Chin up prince!
I support you. I think while what you did was not the best action, you are very much human. You deserve kindness. There’s been forgiveness for much worse. It’s alright. Do better next time. It’s not the end of the world.
It’s sad how much we expect perfection from another  human being.
Much Love to you and your family right now. Thank you for being real enough to address this to the public. keep pushing and letting your greatness shine through
Will je vous suit depuis si longtemps que j'ai l'impression que vous faites parti de mon entourage ! Effectivement ce geste ne vous ressemble pas ! La question : pourquoi a ce moment là vous n'avez su gérer votre agressivité ? Qu'est ce qui vous a poussé à cette réaction ? Qu'avez vous à prouver et à qui ? Vous méritez d'être heureux, d'être vous même et non pas sur le qui vive en permanence ! Parfois on ne voit pas où ne veut pas voir ce qui nous rend malheureux car le "lâcher prise" nous paraît insurmontable. Certaines personnes sont toxiques et nous empêche d'être réellement heureux. La perte de s'en détourner peut paralyser......mais chacun doit faire ses choix en fonction de ce qu'il peut supporter
Little Willy from Philly ?
"Im not saying you should've did it..... But I understand"
Is that mrwhosetheboss merch cap??
This really touched my heart, and I am proud of you Will. You didn't owe us an apology, but we thank you for addressing us anyway. We love you Will, and I pray that healing on all sides happens honestly, truthfully, and gracefully. I pray that friendships can be mended, and/or for acceptance of things that may not be changed. God bless you all, and we look forward to seeing you at your happiest again, and on the small and big screen, and in music again.
Good job Will, you're a humble man. Don't worry, everyone will see you for your fruits, this is how my Lord and Savior Jesus of Nazareth teaches us to recognize good people (not perfect people). Shalom
3:04 I can picture her behind the camera giving him the death stare
Thank you
My heart breaks for you. Yes you are human and everyone makes mistakes, they learn from them and move on just like you will. Much love to you ❤️
Still a fan, will always be. 💜💜
We love you and are praying for you!
Take your time man, I am very much looking forward to your action movies in the future. I really really like your Gemini man. -- Chris | just another fan of yours from the Philippines
You're forgiven.
We never left your side or stopped supporting you, no matter your wrong decisions, and we’re glad you’ve found peace and realised your mistakes
I stand with Will Smith 🙌🏾
Love you Bro 💪🏾🤲🏾🙏🏾💫❤️
You know things like this happen everyday, but you are on the big stage. So it’s magnified. Sounds like you are doing the work. Good for you. 20 years can’t be erased over 1 incident
Oh so wonderful to see you back😭!we all make mistakes,and we all need forgiveness🙏we love you Will💗!
Not a good title…u owe Chris much more
Will Smith seems like a net force for good and is worthy of redemption.
One moment is not the definition of your life. Your value is not found in your decisions. You are precious simply because God created you that way. Do not constrict the life God gave you. Be brave, be bold, but most of all, continue to be Love.
jesus shard licks when fools were wilding out in d temple. i forgive you
william smithiam
Much Love, Will.
I think a lot of people forget that, "Celebrities" are still at core human.  There will be successfully times and there will be gut retching bad times.  You rise up from those bad times and learn from those mistakes and become a better person.  Sometimes those that have been hurt, can not forgive and  you will have to be ok with that.   Thanks for the vid, must not have been easy.
Wild Wild West was my favorite movie as a kid, and you’re forever my favorite actor. Wish you the best through this tough time.
This goes both ways.  He should apologize to you, your family, children and mom.  He is NOT without fault here.
Dear Will, From one Philly native to another...I will be very honest with you...when this happened, I was very disappointed in what transpired. However, as I type this, the tears are flowing because of how you have taken the time to reflect on what happened, why it happened and humble yourself to the world with your remorse. You are well on your way to healing and I pray you continue this journey and that Chris will join you. Keep your head up my Brother! Much love & respect.
We all have our moments in life.  The Bible require us to forgive each other.  I’m praying for you.  All will be well.
It takes a strong person to apologize, and it l takes a strong person to forgive.
Keep ya head up Will.  You’re a human and we all make mistakes or do things that we wish we could get back.  Give yourself some grace big dawg.  Been a fan and will continue to be a fan 💯
We're still with you will. 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
KING BACK! ❤
ITS OK WILL!! WE STILL LOVE YOU! And ANYONE that is still mad, F* THEM!!! (Like they've never made a mistake!!!) We LOVE YOU! 😘
you are right bro
We still love you Willard
All the emotions I felt the day this happened just came back. 😔 Prayers are always in order 💜💫
It has been a minute for real, thanks for taking your time and address the people. Love you and hope you and Chris can be loving brothers again.
Stand Strong my Brother. Ones mistakes are NOT what define him, how he advances and grows from that point does and I know you are a man of high moral caliber. Sometimes we must take a couple steps back in order to make leaps and bounds forward.  I believe in you and all that you do.  I respect all you have accomplished in life and look forward to observing from a far all you will be accomplishing in the future.
How does this man get the guts to talk
Bro why is this topic still being talked about this guys draggging
You’ll always be my favorite actor, and I’ve always looked up to you, your still only human and you make mistakes.
Never left you Will!
I never stopped loving and supporting you will.
Im always gonna be here for u will exactly like u were here for me being my escape watching u bringing laughter all those years has been my escape i love u and I’m always here will ALWAYS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You were at the top and the devil came for you and got you.
'BAD BOYS 4' CANNOT GET HERE FAST ENOUGH!
How long before this gets memed?
I love you, Will. I appreciate you making this video. It was so difficult to feel the sense of utter shock and disappointment when this happened in front of the entire world, while you were simultaneously being celebrated for a huge achievement. I see and feel your Humanity. Thank you for allowing us to witness your process of coming to terms with it both personally and publicly.  You get to be Human, and I am here for it. Blessings to everyone involved.
Сначала я тебя зауважал, но потом ты прогнулся... А теперь только и делаешь, что извиняешься за то, что ты мужик (но я уже не так уверен в этом) и защитил честь своей жены.
😍😍😍 We love you Will Smith, never canceled 💕
Will Smith thank you for apologizing all of us what happened here I know it's shock all of us what happened for the past couple months but I hope someday you'll be back for doing movies and shows again but until then we'll see but I hope I see you again on this channel so I hope you have a good life so good luck Will Smith and thank you for apologizing have a good day
You represented so much for people. Obviously a superstar. I have Admiration for the struggles you have faced. I believe in growth. That was an apology. Watch the movie “everything everywhere, all At once”. You used the term that is in that movie. Sometimes our humanity is is hard to accept than we can handle. You obviously are working to understand yourself. The journey you are on I hope you can forge a better you where shame doesn’t own you. Where you let go of the role you feel you need to be. Own your mistakes and let go of the expectations you place on yourself a lot of the time. Your working. I see that. Thank you.  If I were in your shoes, I would hope that people would respect the effort to understand why and how you are seeking to understand yourself and honor the good while healing the difficult. It’s a journey.   Love and respect to your facing yourself.
the fact that if this was a white man it would be brushed over so quick irks me man 🤦🏾‍♀️
Proud of you Uncle Will. Be safe man I still support you 215aphillyated 🫂 hold ya heart and the love will come.
We need this video man. We care about you Will 1000% but what happened a few months ago led me to question your mental health. I'm glad you gave us some answers.
I respect you more for this video. I read your book and I truly understand what you mean. Keep doing the work. Be peace, Be love, Be great 💜
I don't agree with what he did to Chris. But I hate how one moment, one lapse of judgment, almost negated his entire life's work in the eyes of the masses and through the media. He had always inspired and motivated me to try to be my best and to overcome my fears. He's not a god, just a dude from Philly with talent, ambition and perseverance. All of us have f#d up. Right now I'm working on my own apology in my little world to people I've let down. Not everyone will forgive me, or Will, but I hope most people will eventually see the good greatly outweighs the bad. I'm grateful Will took this step forward today.  ETA: Also why is it no one considered the fact that he may have been drinking. World's most prevalent cause of lapses in judgement! Doesn't excuse it. That's why I don't drink anymore 😅 just may have been a factor.
As people, we mess up and definitely fall short. This was Will's moment.  Keeping you in prayers and all parties involved. The true fans still love you and are rooting for you.
he could fill a whole bottle of SOY sauce in this 5min vid
Nobody's a saint,Will isn't and god knows I'm certainly not one either but it's what we do when we make a mistake and how we make it right is what should define your existence and not the bad thing itself, Will is living proof of this and i for one have,am and will continue to support him
It’s ok Will. Even the good ones snap. Everyone makes mistakes. People can be forgiven. Hell people have done worse
I know how hard this must have been. You are your worst enemy Will so don't be so hard on yourself. Forgive you and come back to us. We need your energy
✊🏾❤️🔥 Salute.
@Lovelyti TV
After three months that's the best you can come up to?? So we Will you give Scientology too much of your money!! "Going clear" right?
I never folded on you brother, I just bought your book 📕 ❤️
I forgive you, Will..we all have been there..love you so much..be strong!
Be gentle with yourself will, no one is perfect and we all make mistakes. 🙏
We love you Will , You have aplogized and asked for forgiveness . It is up to Chris and his family to forgive you as the Word of GOD says In Colossians 3:13  " Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone.  Forgive as the Lord forgave you."   If Chris and his family donot forgive you , They will have to answer to GOD. 🙏
You are a perfect role model, even when you fall you understand the power of getting back up, facing your fear and being the best version of yourself in the present moment, This is what makes you an incredible inspiration. If it’s  time that you need to heal, take it don’t worry about disappointing anyone other than yourself. Be the best version of yourself for Will, we love you for Being you!!
Thanks for your willingness to share something hard. It will help so many people to realize we can make a mistake and apologize.  That we can work on ourselves to understand “the why” and then try and do better.  As humans it’s what is needed and helpful. 👏🙏❤️
All its ok, we love you! forever man!
I wish nothing but healing and restoration for you and Chris.
I appreciate you taking time to do this. Reminds me of moma saying how you show out is how you get corrected. So thank you Will for on your OWN doing this ALONE and it was for sure sincere!
Nobody’s perfect, we are all human and we are all just trying to do our best.
Will  everyone of us have screwed up in some shape form or fashion Trust me !! I still think you are the Best and stop beating yourself up and just keep it movin Much Love
Guys, remember when Logan Paul Fxcked up and the world shite itself   And in time we forgive him. Can we just forgive will please we learn by our mistakes we are only human   ❤️🖤
Love will.
We support you Will!
“Friends again”?? I never stopped being your friend 🥲💛
A case of the disrespected ....disrespect
We are all humans Will, we all make mistakes. When a persons is really sorry and it shows as a truly feeling, that person for sure needs a second chance. I understand your impulsive emotion on that time, we all have those in some point of life. I know what you are and what you want to conquer. You are a good person, even though I do not know you in person. I read your book, I saw all your movies and saw almost all your interviews and work and I will continue there. You need to move forward, for you, your kids and for all of us that we really admire you and respect you. You just need to forgive yourself and move on. Loves and respects from Argentina dear Will
The ONLY mistake you made Will is that you didn’t handle it privately and leave it up to Chris to make a public apology. He embarrassed and insulted your family publicly.
Omg
Personally, I missed you......I can really understand your need to make things right...... thank you for showing human nature maturing from a moment of failure
You are amazing man and phenomenal actor out of 30+ career you had a mishap and it's happens to everyone ,that's doesn't take away all of your accomplishments in life. I'm here for it if you make more movies. Love ya forever Will 💕🙏💯
To take time to think is part of the healing process, you are a human being and has the right to make mistakes  hoping that you and Cris can talk when he is ready and end this Circus once for all, you are kind and honest and we love you for that, God Blessed you and family.
You didn't have to put out this video but I'm glad you did💕
Gurl look at the @lovelyti
Will, as you know we all make mistakes, you are showing your maturity. I am old enough to be your mother, therefore take it in the spirit in which it is given. Will, you are an excellent actor and man, so don't be ashamed of yourself.  You apologized, you forgive yourself, now move more towards being the best man the Lord made you to be with HIS help. Love ya much, Peace Out!
WILL!! I'm a huge fan. We all make mistakes, we are all human. It really takes a lot to sit here and admit you are wrong and apologize. Even I have a hard time, MOST of the time 😩. I respect you for this! We still love you!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I imagine James Avery would be proud of you taking addressing this situation in this way.
So great of you to be transparent and vulnerable. I'm proud of you.
Continue to do your work. You are indeed human and we all make mistakes. We all fall short of God’s glory and no one is above it. Find peace with the resolve that you have come to and move forward. I pray that you and Chris will meet, when he is ready, and work to build beyond the hurt and damage as a result of impulsive moments of cause and effects from both sides. You both are great men! I am forever a fan and that will never change. We are all living day by day, and we all have human experiences that are sometimes beyond our control. God has already forgiven you! Forgive yourself and live each anew. 🙏🏾❤️‍🩹 There is healing in forgiveness.
Just a all around bad situation, I think it was made worse that it happened live in front of everybody. If it had happened bad stage, it probably wouldn’t be such a bad PR incident
You made a HUGE mistake that goes against EVERYTHING you value. I know the angst you’re experiencing is soul piercing. But, you’re human. I still love you as an actor and human. God bless.
Did u and Liza hookup? Are u with what woman currently?
You made a mistake. It doesn't define you. God bless you Wil and Chris🙏🏿🙏🏿
wait until criss accept your applogize
We need to stop looking to Hollywood for role models and look to Christ instead.
We love you, we  forgive you and we remain loyal fans and not just fans-human beings.. Juxtaposed with ALL that you have been to us and given of yourself to us for sooo many years, how could we abandon you in one moment of indiscretion? I can't and there are millions more who agree with me. Team Will-now and ALWAYS! 💕
💕
Glad to see you back Will! I appreciate you coming on live doing this!. Prayers for you and Chris both.
Yo que no se inglés 🤡 quien traduce ?
It’s not a real YouTube apology video if you don’t start with a deep sigh
You did good Will. I have a lot of respect for people that say sorry. I’m proud of you. ❣️
Love you! Thank you for showing this to us
The only thing that matters is that you forgive yourself. As you know, it's the hardest thing to do, though, as you also know, you are doing the hard work to get to that place. I wish you love and light on your journey to your higher self. WE ARE ALL A WORK IN PROGRESS. Peace brother.
I just can't imagine the pressure being in the spotlight....You are human with emotions that we all can relate to...God knows I've said and done things I could have handled differently..This is between you and Chris and I'm sure you guys will work it out and laugh about it years down the line💞
Nothing but love and respect for you Will. Those that love you will always love you and understand that we ALL are human and fall short  of being our best at times and it's ok. Much love and respect to you for taking your time to do your work on yourself for your mental health and journey towards your healing ❤. You are definitely not a piece of sh#t!! You are Just HUMAN!!❤❤❤
I totally agree with the top comment. Anyone that asked me during that time “what do you think of the whole Will Smith incident?” I always responded the same way. I always said “If you read his book, you wouldn’t be too surprised by how he responded”
You made a mistake, you're human. It's okay. It's all love!🤎🙏🏾
I prayed today that you’ll come back and I opened my YouTube and here u are will i am crying right now , i love u so much im so sorry that u gone through life feeling like u have to live up to a standard and to never disappoint that it self is tourture . Welcome back the fresh prince 💕💕💕💕💕💕its gonna be ok and u will win people’s hearts again like u did for the past 30 years that is ur gift in this world WE LOVE UUUUUUU ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Matthew 6:33
We are with you uncle Will <3 <3
Lets be real Will, this was mostly based off Jadas reaction. You were sitting there laughing before you looked at her and saw she was displeased. Unfortunately that woman is toxic. No offense meant but with everything she has put you thru, its not ok. You were trying to defend the honor of a woman that would not do the same for you. Its sad really. Anyone in their right mind could see what was going on and honestly cannot blame you.....that woman has you all twisted up. Its time for Will to find Will again and be the amazing guy I grew up watching and admiring because the Will I grew up around was absolutely amazing.
Will, it's alright. I know what you did is wrong but at the same time you're human, we all make mistakes. I applaud you for finally talking about this incident. Time will heal things, just be yourself, do everything with love. I have been your fan since I was a kid and I will still support you. With lots of love from India.
I thought it was right. You defended your woman when Chris insulted her. Big props to you Will and even bigger props to you that you still make all this work happen to cater to all friends family and all that. Mad respect and mad props Will.
Takes a lot of courage to own your mistakes, happy to see you trying to do what's right
My parents always use to tell me it takes a bigger person to admit when they have done wrong and man you've done so much good we can all take this one on the chin for you I know sometimes us man don't here this alot but your enough and because of who you are I will always support and pray for you peaceful healings.
Glad to see you bruh
✊🏽 here for you man. Get back out there
Welcome back ❤️❤️❤️
You still one of my heroes
Thank you for this video. It appears very sincere and respectful.
Take all the time You need. 🙏🏽❤️✨
We love you Will!
❤️❤️❤️
He’s backkk hand 👋 💯
You are LOVED and RESPECTED.   Blessings to you on your journey KING.  💖
We all make mistakes, it happens.
Thank you for your courage, Will. I've been a fan since I was a kid watching Fresh Prince, I'm a fan today, and I've been inspired along the way.
There you are, Son of God. Congrats for the great human you are. God knows you have a big heart.  We all make mistakes. The most importantis when a real man like you admit  you did wrong reacting in a non properly manner with Chris.   It is great to watch this youtube video of yours giving an apology. You have done your part.  There is joy in heaven a child of God recognizes and accepts  a bad conduct and decides not to do it not to do it again. God i is proud of your humble attitude Mr. Smith. I am  a person from Nicaragua who admires all you have done , your legacy of love for others. I am sure that  many people from my country, from central america,your country and all nations on earth love you for who you are and your commitment to do always your best. God bless your life and the lives of your family. Christ will accept your apology because he is also  a good man. You are brothers created by a forgiving and lovely Father, Our God. Keep it up, Mr. Smith.God keep guiding you to do the right with love.100%
Stay strong Will, you always been my favorite 😍 and God understands that you are human and we make mistakes.  He got your back and God will see you through this.
Will I stand with you. Take care of yourself Black King.
Thank you for sharing with us your heart. You have my support still.
all my support will you can go though this 💪💪💪
I think it was right to do a sorry video, but as a fan, I know that Will isn't a bad person, he is human like he said and people make mistakes sonething, so personally I would 100% forgive him. At the same time, I think it is really up to Chris to forgive him for what he did. Just an opinion ❤💙
Thank you for this I still have all the respect that 🙏 I have always had God Bless you and your Beautiful Family ❤
♥️
one word for all of this: Accepted
This guy has given so much entertainment and joy to the world. He has been a role model to millions.  Yes he made a mistake but so do we all. You will always be a legend to me Will!
Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏
Hello— very good see you.
Love you Will!❤️
We all make mistakes. You have been an outstanding role model for many many years. It was not right to do but it happened. You have been wise and strong enough to admit your mistake and ask for forgiveness. I am sure Chris will get there. Mental health is a terrible battle and I hope you find what you need and are able to be content.
We love you Will!
Uncle Will You were not foggod out in those moments....because in the moment you felt right about the decision you had made and didn't take the wrong you had done into acount....Until the backlash of it finally befell your eyes and mind.....instead you justified your actions on stage attathed to the role you played in a movie as the protector of your kids....so no.....your not going to do that......i have been a real real big fan of yours from when i was only 15 years old....and to see the star of my life WILL SMITH pull what he had off left me broken completely of the man you showed me you were over the years....but despite my rage toward you....on one hand its probably right that you went through what you had....because now you've done the work and clearly its impact has had its ways into your life in terms of growing through it and learning from it emotinally and mentally.......and finally as a young black man among many more out the who look up to you....i hope its a mistake we will live to never see again coming from you.....I FORGIVE YOU....AND HOPE MANY OTHERS WILL DO SO OVER TIME....
Iam from india  i know what you feel i stand with u
God bless you ! WE ALL make mistakes ! You still the man 🙏🏿
really? after three months...that's it?!
Jayda might not have said anything but you could see she wanted a result. You were laughing till you saw the look on her face. Your a good guy and it was out of character for you.
We all forgive you Will… Your a great dude! And a great inspection and mistakes happen
To the must humble person and a man of God you are a true blessing to us all no need to apologize you are a human and we all do make mistakes in life but the lesson is we all learn from them and trust me you have lost nothing from your fans souly on if there human because they know that God is The only one perfect and this life so don't ever feel like you have to keep
I don't care what anybody says. You're the man, Will!
👏🏾🙏🏽
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hope that reconciliation is possible between Will and Chris 🙏🏾
A humbling moment... a lesson in this for all of us. My prayers for him... for all of us in our humanness.
I want to be pissed off at you but we need bad boys 4. Lol 😆 It's okay man we forgive you.
God bless you and stay encourage Will 🙏
Sometimes our emotions and personal experiences gets the best of us, we all been there and will go through that here and there, I'm not perfect and I forgive WILL, I hope he will forgive himself.
Been a upstanding man,for 20 to 30+ years no craziness until this and now he's the worst person in the world.   I swear sometimes.i hate the internet Soo many sooo call perfect people smh swear they don't make mistakes....
It was one mistake. One SMALL, stupid mistake in all of the time you've had your career. If people want to stop supporting you or being your friend for that, then they never really supprted you and were never really your friend. Some of us are looking forward to your return. ❤️
First and foremost I love and respect you as the man you are and have become.... I  have followed you since your rap days and it's not gonna change now..  We all go through stuff, some more than others and that's what makes us human.  Do whatever YOU need to do to  get yourself together first, then you can work on making it right with everyone else. You still have a lot of loyal fans in your corner, I'm one of them. Peace, love, blessings and inner healing vibes is my gift to you💖
greetings from holland.
Omg I was just saying it is time for Will to come back outside
One mistake doesn't make the man. As long as you learn from it, I believe in moving forward.
cant knock a man for looking within doing that personal work, seeing where he went wrong and trying to fix things. Respect
We don’t hate you, Will! I hope we can all understand the conditions and circumstances of being in the public eye and how difficult it makes being human. We all got issues dealing with and we all have moments we’re not too proud of. You just focus on getting better man, as should all of us!
Why did it take so long for this?
.
Chuck it Wills... Things happens.. Weired moments happens even gods life.. even there are stories were gods asked forginess from man.. So Forgiving is greatness and asking forgiveness is godly.. 🙏❤️
Love you  Will. I will always be a fan of yours. Wishing you all the best.
This will be on mainstream news outlets by afternoon
We’re all human.
Real men apologize and that’s what you did. You were just heated in a moment and blacked out.
Praying for your continued healing.
Good to see you Will you gonna get through this Bro I wish you all the best through this journey I’ve been in a similar situation and I’m walking with u.
You proved yourself to be a true man by apologizing, really my respect for you has been increased to infinity. We all do mistakes in our life at some point and it's fine. Don't worry take your time man, we *Will* always be with you.
🤡
Will Smith you are my favourite actor and everything else you do I will always respect you we all make mistakes everyone dose
Praying for your continued healing. Hope you and Chris can talk soon so he can continue to heal as well. You are a whole human. I love that you are letting us in on your self work. Thank you for answering the questions. You showing up gives a lot of people permission and the  tools to do the same. ❤
I wish you well Will
i just finished your book and it inspired me so much, and seeing u hurt , hurts me too, i hope u return soon to the craft u mastered , so i can see u back on the big screen  and clap for u and scream BigWillieeee  is back
I really appreciate your true repentance,I can see from facial expression that it comes from your heart , I hope that Christ will hear it and be touched by the message , l'm still praying for you things gonna be alright .
Welcome Back.
Can we talk about the political and economic state of the world, right now?
I hope that Will is okay mentally.
Now this is something that we can all feel. I know it took a lot to do this. Thank you brother.
Love you will we all make mistakes it's how u comeback from that mistake which defines you keep your head up
We all make mistakes and do things we regret. Anyone who doesn't accept that is just so perfect I guess....not. Chris might never speak to you again and you will have to accept that. I hope he and his family can forgive you. Good luck with everything and I hope you continue to make movies. 🙏♥
Mr Smith,  from now on  you will have to avoid provocation because I am sure the devil will send you people who are going to test you. You know how the media works, praise you and destroy in no time.  Avoid those nasty people at all cost.
You are King. Thank you
🤴🕎✝️☦️🤲
God doesn’t condemn you and nor do I. Jesus knew about that moment when he got on the cross. That moment doesn’t define you in my eyes. I believe the very core of you is to be a man that is pleasing in God’s eyes. He allowed that moment so that you would sit down and heal some things.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
My man deserves to be forgiven. We'll have shitty moments in life, a lot actually but we learn and grow from our own mistakes.
I understand anger, it's not fun... You're overall a really good person I believe and you shouldn't dwell in shame, that makes you more angry sometimes so good thinking❣️
Great job Will.... forward motion
Нет, нет, нет!!!! Крис недостоин слов извинений и унижения настоящего мужчины. Уилл ты поступил правильно!!!
Everyone makes mistakes. It's part of life. You live and you learn. You don't need to apologize forever.
He really meant what he's saying you can tell
Welcome back!
It was a moment in time.  We all have a breaking point and I feel that moment was yours. Dont hold on to it.. give it to God.  Learn to forgive yourself.  We still love you.  I think it's the "good guy" image that everyone has of you that keeps them from remembering YOU ARE HUMAN. Time heals all wounds... its man that keeps picking at the scab. ❤
Everyone makes mistakes.  Some much bigger than others.  Acknowledgment of ones own mistake and putting in the work to understand how you got to that place where that could happen is a good first step. Keep doing the work, and hopefully one day you can earn back some of the trust lost that day.
First I want to say, I hope you are doing ok today( mentally,spiritually and emotionally). We all make mistakes in life and none of us are perfect but with God all things are possible. I pray that you are able to get back to you and know we stand with you. We love you and I'm always praying for you.
Missed seeing you. Things happened and there's Noone who can throw stones Period. Stop trying to live up to people expectations only live to please God. He forgives and never thinks about it again so who are people that don't have a heaven or hell to place you in. And probably go see Hell themselves. Keep your head up and you already apologized let this be the end of it. Forgiveness is for yourself not others God has you.  Never allow Anyone to keep you in bondage that's not of God
Much love to you, Will!
We missed you, welcome back ❤️
I hope we will see you again soon in theatres
I love you Will🙂💜
Before the media circus starts, this. You are a great man and a credit to this video. You've always been my hero, and this only goes to show that it takes a real man to own up to mistakes. I advise everyone to read your book since it will make more sense when they do.
You are human and I always understood that.  You made a mistake and you have paid for it.  Let’s move on.  I still and always have love you!  You are a wonderful person!🙏🏼❤️
We are all human and mistakes are made #StayBlessed🙏🏿
Love you Will!  You're the best. ❤
We miss you
It's been long enough. Welcome back.
we forgive you, Will. one bad decision doesn’t define you.
love you will forever <3333333333
Idc...I love this
I'm from Russia 🇷🇺
You apologising now after months?What are you thinking.
Will, we miss you and we love you!
Damn
Bad boys for life Mr Smith.  We all make mistakes you are still my role model ❤️
Awesome apology dude, you’re back in business you’re forgiven .
Love you Will!
We still love you Will❤️
Will Smith The Legend forever
A person can only take so much before they go off on someone.  And you were at your limit. Thats just life. Keep pushing forward man.
Thank you Will, I have looked up to you since I was 6 years old. I am 21 now and trying to start a life of my own. I never lost faith in you but either way this means a lot to me. I know being a symbol puts more weight in you than I will ever have to deal with but know that in my heart you are still that symbol. Probably never gonna read this but I want you to know that you helped me through some of the hardest times of my life and continue to do so. You are a human and that's okay.
You still have our support. Many blessings on your healing journey. Many blessings on Chris Rock's healing journey as well.
No matter what.... These kind of mentality that you shown in action like this is a true definition of high level of wisdom, self control and pure good heart .....take your time
I'm glad you spoke out, Will. Ignore the toxic people. Yes, it was VERY shocking you snapped, but we're all human, celebrity or not, nice people or not, but things happen. I wish you the best on your work on trying to fix everything. I will always be a fan of you, Mr. Smith.
❤️❤️ I feel our largest growth comes from what we learn from the mistakes we make.
We are and always will be friends.... Apology takes a lot of courage... And I know Chris will understand 💙💙... Time gives opportunity to improve and let people forgive as well..
Sei una grande persona
I've been a big fan of yours since your rap career, I admit I was very disappointed didn't know if I was going to come back as a fan. But I had to realize your human too you made a mistake Welcome Back Will, We love you. I will be praying for you Godbless
This is the only time i will watch an apology video genuinely
I still love you. I'm happy you did this.
I suppose the difficulty surrounding this particular (very human) mistake, is the public nature of it all. Who among us hasn’t made a life altering mistake that we wish we could take back (no hands should be raised 😐). In your case, Will, while I join with others in the unfortunate shock and spectacle of it all, I feel nothing but sympathy for you and all those affected. Sincerity and our good friend Time will indeed heal this deep wound like all others. Perhaps not with a resolution that we might all hope for in respect to others forgiving you, but that does not negate your self worth. We all have great and eternal worth to be sure. Ultimately and gratefully, yours (as with all others) is measured only between you and God. I for one wish you a peaceful heart, continuing prosperity, the love of those who surround you and with a little time the compassion from those you seek forgiveness of. 🙏🏼
We love you....thanks for this words and know that all will be better.
Oh what an inspiration you are sir!!! Bless you sir! My boys and I are surely hanging on!🙏🏽
Everybody makes mistakes, nobody is perfect!! It's all about learning from them and become a much better person than you where before. You are a great person with an awesome heart. And this is so great of you to do this video. One love ❤️
You made a mistake that doesn’t mean you are a mistake
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everyone makes mistakes,even celebrities.  We're all human. ❤️
Respect 😀
Mr. Smith, you humbly apologized to Chris, his momma and family, and to your family. That’s all that matters. I read and listened to your adventurous book when it came out… I pray you get delivered from feeling shameful. YOU ARE HUMAN WILL. Release that, then gon head living and uplifting the world. We’re not on your shoulders.. so please do not drown in your disappointment. Love you foreal Mr. Smith. You gon be alright:)
Thank you Will for being honest, authentic and vulnerable… I hope and pray this brings back your light… Keep yo head up Bro
Nah man you are hollywierd now. Sad.
Much have many but just body bag walk work and ending be nothing on front live ending ...life rich but end nothing ...useless profil , profesional movie star ...hahahah so Shame on earth univers Laws UNDERSTANDING knowledge Nature
My brother will stay strong love you brother both of you guys we are human we all make mistakes stay strong
Seen you been doing stand up!?!?!?! Wtf will you let the world down!
You're a good man
You fucked up man !
Unfortunately we are in a world where if you do 100 good things but fail in one, they judge you as if you were the worst criminal. Will, you will always continue to be a great example of life💪🏽
Will and Depp are the same : rich, famous, respectful but if you have a wrong Better Half you cant' be happy
Man.  Will you had a momentary lapse of judgement of which we all have at times. You are human and as humans we all make mistakes.  Be strong in your faith and family and just be the man we all know and love.  God bless.
As disappointed as I was in that moment brotha I know you and Chris will recover. So keep doing the work on yourself, and continue to reach out to people around Chris that may be able to facilitate a meeting. Your still black excellence with the responsibility to show others how to bounce back.  Keep your spirits up and your ego in check.
Thank You 💜
We ALL make mistakes!! YOUR LOYAL FANS ARE ALL STILL HERE FOR YOU💗💗💗
sending love🙏🏾
We love you!  Even with this incident, YOU still shine brighter than most.  I’m not mad at you or disappointed…you’re human and we all make decisions that we may want to change.  This doesn’t change ANY of the great things you have done and are going to do.  How certain people or media outlets responded to this DOES NOT reflect everyone’s opinion of you.  Value what is really worth value.  Continue to be that man you want to be…this is your journey & allow God to restore you, his rewards are greater than what this world has to offer.  Blessings to you & your entire family🙏🏾💌.  Y’all ARE loved & appreciated truly by those that see your efforts to help the world.  Continue to walk in power & sound mind.  Much respect.  🫡
What up Will.Good to see you bro.I knew you eventually make a video to Chris and his family expressing how sorry you were.We love you bro and keep your head up.
Uncle Will you are still the best! We all fall on hard times and you still have love coming at you! You have always been real and even in the event you showed a realness that we all go through, we hear you we miss you. You deserve enough time and be with yourself !
Proud of you, Will.
💝❣️👑💐 Love From Ahmedabad Gujarat INDIA....🙏🏻 That's the greatest man proud moment..✊🏻👑
We love you will....
I don’t think Chris will accept your apology until he heals from the whiplash 💀
Will, you are the very DEFINITION of L❤️VE, honor, and G❤️ODNESS!!! lYou made a mistake, and I salute you for taking ACCOUNTABILITY for that mistake.  Know that you're still LOVED all over the world, and I know  "This Too Shall Pass". God bless🙏🙏......
What happened was very unfortunate the fact that you apologized the day after is good and the fact that you realize there was learning is obviously a sign that you are truly a man a man who fell but you are truly a man cuz a man is willing to admit when he's made mistakes and learn 👏👍👌 glad to have you back
WE LOVE YOU WILL.... PERIOD! 🙅🏾
Will, Sou brasileiro, E como brasileiro sei o valor que nós temos por vocês Norte-americanos. Mais ainda assim, Isso não apaga, o que a sua imagem passou para nós. Para nós, você sempre será aquele garoto! E todo humano erra! Nem todos tem um holofote virado para si, mas a busca na vida, é crescer como pessoa. Um Abraço!
Animo will, muchos estamos contigo
Much love Will!💖💖💖💖
When God wants you to grow he makes you uncomfortable and one of the saddest places to be is in a situation you don’t want to be in but believing it’s the only option you have.
i love you man no matter what.
YAY!!! You’re back!
Genuine
my brother in Christ it has been 4 months
Hey Will,  much respect to you brother.  We all make mistakes and bad decisions at times in our lives, it's called being human. I know I've done things that I truly regret but it helped me to grow into a better person.
I guess the most surprising thing was that it seemed totally out of character.    Having said that, everyone fucks up at some point, so no hard feelings on my part about it.  I hope you and Chris will sort it out and bring this chapter to an end
Everyone deserves a second chance. Much love Willy!
positive vibes from me to you.. good luck on your journey with the Most High... keep healing
You were a huge part of my childhood, Will. I'm glad you're understanding your own mistakes and am trying to make amends with them. I hope more people support you in this time man. I know a lot of people that already are, but I'm sure there're more who're gonna step up for you after this. Take care man.
This is awesome of you. We're all human and things happen.  Use it as a learning experience and grow.  Be blessed!
We all make mistakes that we wish we could go back in time and correct, nobody's perfect. Having 1 brief lapse in judgment doesn't erase the almost 40 years you've given us of positivity, great energy and great entertainment. Can't wait for whatever you got planned next big dog
You said it perfectly.  You are Human.  Hopefully you two men can talk and mend fences. But I don’t think less of you. I’m not above your actions.  We have all made mistakes and we have all acted in a way that we regretted later on from time to time. I still have nothing but love for you!!!!
well done, this is appropriate for you, especially as an adult
Burn that Red Table!! 💯LUV
❤️❤️❤️❤️
the problem is you did all of that over a bi*ch
I understand you and I bet Chris feel the same thing we are just humans after all Making mistakes is part of our nature
I’ve been a huge fan for decades now, I’ll say I wasn’t proud of this one moment in time where you lost your composure however it humanized you to some degree for me. I think it opened peoples eyes to some extent, now people can see Will Smith is human and makes mistakes just as we all do. I still love and support you as I always have, but now I feel a kinship to you because I now see you’re just like me human. We all make mistakes and with love remorse and growth are all better for those mistakes.💚💚
Man the media gonna go crazy because of this.....so much headlines I'm thinking and mostly fake 🥲🤣🤣but still I would still love you and wish you all the best Mr Smith I been a fan....yet I'm lying if I'm not disappointed....🥲but I know you'll make it better with Chris .....I'm sorry and I still believe....it's human we can change .....so do our heart that mends , thank you I'm sorry again .....hope it be better 👌❤️
We love you Will!
We know you are a great man
Humility is the watch word and you've done your part. Please only think of yourself just the way Christ thinks of you. You are beautifully and wonderfully made remain blessed Will stay strong this too shall pass.
Bruh!U Still Got 200% LOVE ❤️ Over Here!! Chris Got Love As Well.. Don’t Let The Devil’s Keep You Guy’s From Getting Back Together!! Go See The Minister!!🫡❤️
You were missed!
This is the first step to get people's respect back, it really is. You've regain mine that's for sure. We all make mistakes, but this is what real man do. RESPECT!
Still 🐐
We miss you and stand by you!!! Thanks for supporting blk women Wil! Much love!
👏🏾🙏🏾❤
Took a deep breath before I started watching this
Continue to process of inner healing.We love you and will be here. We will always be friends 💞
Take your time. You aren't a POS. You're one of us, HUMAN. It's cool bro. I support you and Chris. Heal, and enjoy your life OG. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
🙏🏽❤️
Real Accountability. There no other way for Men. I’m pleased he took his time, and did it his way, while still maintaining his dignity. Own up to what you did and give your mindset, don’t blame or make excuses, and live with the consequences. Good Job. Let’s move on now.
You know Will, when you can fess up to your weakness and can apologise publicly you know that you are headed into the right direction as the hardest part is seeking forgiveness from yourself as a fellow Libra I know that won't be easy. I trust that Chris will accept your apology just know that he may not forgive you which is separate....and that is ok. You are ok and you will continue to be ok. Live your life Will and not that of others. Big love to you❤
I have always taken a lot of inspiration from Will. I would talk about Will as a thought leader. As an "IDEA" that anyone can craft out a beautiful life for themselves. I was very vocal about my love for will and what he represented. That day - My Heart Broke, then I thought to myself - we are all human and we all screw up sometimes. Now I'm just looking forward to see how Will teaches us to bounce back from something like this. I am so happy that you posted this Video ! The way you now put will back out into the world is so important - because we (your followers) will all be learning and taking on board - how to deal with situations that get out of hand. Lots of Light and Love from Me!
Perhaps the most sincere youtuber apology of all time
Love to you Will, time will heal and reveal our new path, remember this as a experiencie of self redemption, for yourself... Only you and the ones who really appreciate you...
use me as disklike button
We all love you Will❤❤ we all stand with you💕💕
As you said it you are human. Period. None of us is perfect. The best teacher in life is experience. So although it wasn’t the greatest decision we all learn from everything we do. Wether good or bad. Much love to you and Chris and you will always be amazing in my eyes. May your journey be a successful one.
Love you uncle Will, you are loved no matter what. No excuse cause humans gon make mistakes, that's how we learn. I'm here for the human you are and still inspire me to be❤️
We are human....Errors in judgement and mistakes will be made. I place no judgement  on you as a human being because it could happen to the best of us all. I will always support you sir, through the good times and the bad. Much love Will 🙏🏿
I love you so much. Sending positive vibes to you and your loved ones. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
We all have made bad choices and decisions. It takes a lot of courage to apologize.  Job well done!! I’m still a Will Smith fan hands down!
I BEEN LOOKING FOWARD OF WILL SMITH I DO HAVE ONE MOVIE IDEA ITS JUST LIKE HANCOCK MOVIE 🎬
That's what a real man/gentleman do. Period.
Will, I was thoroughly disappointed. However, we're human. It's normal to be ashamed. That's conviction from the Holy Spirit. Don't stay there. I still love & support you! I've watched the work you did when writing your book. God Bless!
Miss you Will
Most respect will 🙏🏾
I respect Will for this
It’s all good Will. Anyone who truly loved you before, still does after. We all do things in life that we wish we didn’t. You are working on yourself and the relationships you have with those affected. All the best to you and those you love. I’m looking forward to everything you do in the future. I’m proud of you for making your personal and spiritual growth a priority. Much love.💖🌘
You've apologized. Time for everybody to just move on. You're not perfect and if just one incident changes people's impression of you, they don't understand what being human, with human emotions, truly means. Not that you'll even notice me in the comments but I'm still a fan. Have a great weekend!
I hope it will end all of this. I happy that you’re back to apologize Chris and his family. We all making mistakes.  We move on.   I hope Chris will accept your apologies.   Love U Will❤️🙏🏾
We are human and as humans we do make mistakes regardless of how unfavorable that act may be.  Only time will allow all to heal.  I commend Will for his kind words and I do pray that in time Chris will be able to forgive.  You are both an important part of our entertainment life and would be very saddened to lose either you to this craft.  Many well wishes to you both!  I adore both of you!
You're human. We still love you!
Man, I appreciate you Will. You made a mistake. You're human. The important thing is you're man enough to admit it and you're wise enough to learn from it.
Peace. Love you Smith Family. 🌺
This is good. Feels genuine and I feel the honesty. All positive brother. Move on now.
Lovely to see you will. Everyone makes mistakes we are all human.big love ❤️❤️
We forgive you.. we all have our moments. You are a human FIRST  and a "role model" last!!!! Welcome back
Glad he did it away from Red Table Talk.
Whoever judge Will cuz of that.. there’s always 3 fingers pointing at yourself when you do it. I will always remember him as one of my favorite actors. I’m not condoning his actions but we can all forget about this.
We still friends.  I was never mad.  All of us have that 1 moment in time.  ❤❤❤
We all make mistakes! You are awesome Will Smith!!! Sending you Love, Peace and Joy🙏🏾✨💗
“To be remorseful without shame, because I am only human”  Will is always dropping Gems!
🥰❤️
We forgive you!
🎵 We fall down But we get up We fall down But we get up We fall down But we get up For a saint Is just a sinner who fell down, But we couldn't stay there, And got up🎵
You have such an impact on the world that this shook us. That’s how special you are to us. It is what it is…we have lived to see another day. The world will continue to turn. We love you Will ❤️
We love you
Stay strong will when one door closes another  one opens.
What happened was shitty but I think everyone can acknowledge it was a moment of madness with emotions running high. We all make mistakes, we’re all only human. Take the time for yourself, we’ll still be here when you come out the other side.
You’re just human we all make mistakes. Hopefully you and Chris can have that talk one day and move on from this. Both of y’all have brought so much happiness to us.
NO TELEPROMPTERS 😁😜💃🏿🖤🙌🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
We love you Will!!
On t'aime Will ❤️❤️❤️🇨🇵☝🏻
We love you Will we support you brotha
God got you bro
I love you Will.
Love you WILL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This doesn't change how we look at you or how much people love you. You are still loved and appreciated, especially because you know what you did was wrong and you are working through it. YOU ARE HUMAN! BE GENTLE WITH YOURSELF.
"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.  John 8:7"   We are all humans and we all make mistakes. You're still awesome in my book, Will! Much love! 💕
Will, you're getting manipulated for the love of god, you know what you must do for your own mental health, there's people literally demolishing everything about you Your mental state Your fame Your reputation Your very being You need to STAY AWAY from we all know who, apologizing to your kids isn't enough, I'm telling you this as a son of an idiot father, you have to fix a lot with them, I hope you do, I mean it
The first steps to healing are recognizing your faults, apologizing and making things right. You are an amazing human being and thing are going to be all right. Blessings to you and yours ❤🙏🏼🥰
We are with you friend, you are a reference for the lives of many, you are a gentleman and I admire you. I will always support you friend
Couldn’t have been easy. So much respect. 🫶🏼
we must all have the right to be ignorant in order to achieve the right to be better.
It’s all good Will. I’m a fan and always will be a fan. Like you said your human. When all make mistakes. We love you bro!🙏🏽
I'm not gonna say who but you need to rid yourself of one of those ppl you apologized to. You fucked up but we all do and please understand if Chris doesn't want to ever have anything to do with you. You apologized and that's all you can do. Wishing you well!
Great job Will, honest and sincere.
Welcome back! We missed you! You're human and we all make mistakes. Love you forever.
I appreciate you taking your time and processing everything before just giving an empty media response. Its not the mistakes that breaks us,but the lessons and growth that makes us. Huge fan,and I appreciate this personally.
I've always like and respect you and healing IS the word. There are 99 questions and you answered 3.5. I really hope you get around to those 96.5.
You got alot of work ahrad of you Will
There is grace for everyone, because we are all humans. No one is a perfect being. People expect public figures to be perfect, but they are not! So, Will I love what you have contributed to the world and your one moment of imperfection will never erase all you have done in my eyes. Keep your head up, keep seeking good counsel, keep living and loving….This too shall pass🙏🏽❤️!
Thank you for this Will. I know it's gonna take some time but I'm glad you're looking forward.
Where is the apology for dragging Richard Williams name through the mud? Where’s the apology to Serena and Venus for using their father as an excuse for the angry moment *you* committed?
好きやで！ I hope your futher success!!! from Japan
Beautifully said Will, conviction brings repentance and for that 👏👏👏.
Real men know when to accept their faults and be responsible for their actions. Always been a big supporter of you and this just amplifies that. Much love unc!
Uncle will NO script speak from the  heart ✊🏿👑
Respeto!, eres un gran ser humano Will!😃
I still fully respect u
Woah
"Healing" wasnt mentioned! She's loosing her grip!! She's getting the privilege of being referred to as babe tho.. hopefully that fizzles out n he let's her go.
It's definitely a humane way to deal with what happened. What happened has already been done. It's now time for healing and learning from the mistakes. I still love and appreciate you Will.
Will sir, you are more than just a moment. Continue to Lead in Love. After apologizing and asking for forgiveness, you now need to forgive yourself. May God’s Grace and Mercy cover both you and Chris on your journey.
I still love you unconditionally Will! ❤️
"I'm deeply remorseful, buy my book, my water and check out Westbrook" 😂
I think you are still one of the kindest person! Everyone makes mistakes, it’s over. I hope Chris gets to you soon.
Everyone makes mistakes. We still love and support you.
Life happens stuff happens and this is good. Everyone makes mistakes. Now it's time to heal. And when everyone is ready then the healing can begin.
we love you ❤️
❤❤❤❤💛💛💛💛💛
we love u. Ur human.
We missed you. Glad you're doing the work ❤
I just want to say, I love you Will. Go easy on yourself. Have remorse without beating yourself up. You are love and you are loved. Love & Light
One of my favorite people that got caught in a nigga moment on live tv 😔
No reason for shame. Shame is not a useful emotion. Return to the light. We all know it’s there in you. Hope to see you again when you are ready.
Your only human. ❤️❤️ Everyone makes mistakes.
We are all Human with moments of weakness. You have apologized meaning you realize your mistake. No need to dwell on it Will.
You did not let me down I got your back I'm going to stand with you no one is perfect even Jesus got angry take care of you and keep doing what you've always done walk with your head held high that's all anybody can do.  Blessings to all❤❤❤
thanks will, we love you
Big Respect. Always a fan. This storm shall pass. Forgive yourself
You are just the best!
We lovveeee uuuuuu thank god you’re back💕💕💕💕💕💕💕😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭i miss u kinggg
Well it's time to move on and go to work welcome back brah
Nice to see all the support in the comments. It’s clear you’re genuinely sorry about what you did. You made a mistake - You admitted that you were wrong - You apologized - You learned a valuable lesson the hard way - Now it’s on all of us to put it behind us and move on. Much Love
I hope you and Chris heal in your time ❤️ lots of love to both of you ❤️
You have always been a person of integrity. No scandal for thirty years. Keep your head up! Sending love and prayers for you and your family.
Hey will I know you won’t see this but.  Your an amazing person , and like everyone I know had been hating on you and it’s been pissing me off because you’ve done so much and everyone makes mistakes in there career , and that’s what makes them great.  Umm and like Kobe and magic they messed up real bad by rapping those girls , but look at where they are.  I mean I’ve always looked up to you will and I understand how you can get caught in the moment , a lot of people don’t know how to move on and that’s something that sucks about all of this , but I still look up to you as my idle, my favorite actor , and I hope you don’t think bad of yourself because of that one mistake because the world hates the great ones but nobody hates the good ones , love you will , keep up the work because your an amazing guy.  ) Hope to watch a movie again because your truly the best
I appreciate the fact that he's come out and directly addressed it in this video. I know people won't forgive Will, but I'll always respect someone putting in the work to repair something they broke. I doubt he'll be as beloved in the public eye as he once was but I'm happy he's not trying to ignore and sweep this all under the rug.
This is so important to show that Will took a moment to rethink and speak from the heart
We can all choose to do things, so we can choose to say we done with you!!!!
None of us are perfect. When we get angry, we may not be ourselves. But Will, you've always been close to perfect ♥️
Yes. You made a mistake. I saw the hurt and anguish in your eyes. I pray for both families to find healing. I still have love for you both. ❤️
We're all subject to error, but we must acknowledge it, own up to it, learn from it, and be better. I wish both you and Chris the best.. 💪🏾🤎🙏🏾
Big Will!!! Appreciate the work you are doing and I hope Chris and yourself get a chance to sit down face to face and reconcile your differences! We still have Mad Love for you and your Family! Keep your head up! ✌🏾
Love you Will. Praying for all involved.❤️
♥️♥️♥️
Hey Will as a youngin from Philly who recognizes the journey you’re on I respect and love you/your character. Before and through all this you have been someone I look up to. It takes a huge amount of Bravery and strength to do what you are doing period. You are a wonderful Human and I look forward to seeing more. Take your time and keep being you, you always got a fan over here
Glad to see you're taking the next step. If people are to be honest with themselves we all have been pushed at some point and acted out of character. Sadly your moment happened to be seen by everyone.
I’m glad he did this and not the red table talk
I understand why you behaved the way you did. I'm sorry is more than enough. I saw you standing up. There are no mistakes in life. There's no need for apologies.  We're all human. Keep showing us your mind. It's great to have you back!
This apology should be in person screw the internet.  And Will this is disappointing... WE YOUR AUDIENCE DON'T NEED TO HEAR YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY WE NEED TO SEE IT Chris and his family needs to see you apologize.
Will check out Andrew Tate (Top G) videos for good advices
Aunque tu reacción no fue la correcta, Chris tampoco acertó con su broma (de hecho, no acertó con muchas de sus bromas). Of course you're not a piece of s***. Everybody makes a mistake alguna vez en la vida. Or more than one. I love you. I always do. Thank you for this video.
Y’all still falling for this industry ritual BS!!!
You may not have did the right thing in the moment but you’ve been reaching out and took the time to answer questions and as a fan of you and your family for basically my whole life, I’m not disappointed sometimes these things happen in life, unfortunately this was caught on camera but I honestly don’t think you should be beating yourself up this hard , I still love ya will !!!
Will, you have been a favorite of mine for a long time and I don't think this incident tarnishes my view of you in any way. I feel the YouTube apology goes a long way towards those that expected more from you. Please keep making more great movies and thanks for sharing your thoughts!
People make mistakes the world isnt perfect and the people that were tearing u down at the moment were acting like they've never made mistakes i idolized u b4 that during that moment i said it was a mistake and still idolize u after no need to apologize just pray that have the strength to move and know even though u dont know me you still have people pulling for you
Hi Will! I support you. Thank you for being transparent 👑
white background wearing white clothes typical apology vid
To err is human. It takes a big man to accept his mistakes and take responsibility for them. God bless you
Takes a big man to step up and hold himself accountable and reflect in front of the world. Respect 👏
This is the difference between jeda and will  He doesn't accepts what he did and apologize for it
love to you WILL.!!❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🔥🔥
It's definitely good to see you again Will Smith. It takes a real man to stand up I was wrong.. But just remember everyone makes bad decisions and everyone definitely did something they regret throughout their lives. I Love You Will God Bless  You And Your Family. 🙏👏🙏
Break up with jaden
Some of us realize you are human, just like us... with emotions, just like us.   "Respond don't react" is a hard lesson. It's hard to lose a friendship because of a mistake.
I was so mad at you as many were. But never will I just count you out. I will always love you and only want the best for you. I pray when Chris gets ready you guys can talk. This may not be for a long time because this was major. In the meantime work on yourself stay close to God and forgive yourself. You must start there. I love you Will Smith!🙏🏾
You’ve been one of my favorite actors ever since Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I am proud to see you always working on yourself. We’ve all made mistakes, some that are truly damaging to others and we live and learn. I do hope that you and Chris can repair your relationship and heal and move forward. Black men are very much needed.💜
It's ok you made a mistake you're human as long as you also can forgive yourself within all this drama that's the hard part just take your time to deal with this. You are still a role model to me🙏🏽
You've apologized and are truly sincere. Healing takes time (on both parts). It will work out! Big love!
You are human and we all make mistakes and have regrets for things we’ve done. Forgive yourself! Once you do that, you can move on to a place of peace and reconciliation.
You're only human. We all make mistakes. At least you're recognizing yours, and willing to work on yourself.
Temptation comes to all of us; and we are never well prepared to handle temptation’s invasion in our unshielded moments.    That’s why we reference biblical teachings, for example, …”FORGIVE THEM, for they know NOT what they are doing “……
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
You have done so many illustrious things in your career. This 5:44 video confronting your fan base I'm certain, has to have been the hardest thing you've done thus far. Real ones won't waiver. You're STILL a pillar of strength. ❤
Finally I red your book in the time
❤🧡❤🧡❤🧡
I realy appreciated what you trying to do. When man reconized. May God make you stronger as before. You are a source inspiration for African🇹🇬🇹🇬  young men like me
Will def fighting some demons. wish him well
Very good video... extremely honest and sincere❤️
Will Smith decide to open about the issue that have 'linger' around him instead of silence himself and run away is something most people should do to solve problem, very based action actually  I said thing like this because most people are simply too arrogant to admit they are guilty
We still love you Will ❤️
Love you will !! Thank you for this
💞
It's ok will please take your time
Uncle Phil also made mistakes ! Nobody's perfect
We all agree, all makes mistakes, and we cannot judge others without judging ourselves too ... there is only one last thing I would like to see: Jada's apologies.  Or at least a statement from her.  Beacuse, I am not convinced that this does not concern her too, from your private as a couple, to her public behavior towards you… An hug to you Will 🖤
Thank you for your apology and this means a lot as a fan. On the positive side of things i will keep watching your movies. Take care of yourself please and thank you
Its ok Champ, we still got love for ya...  I hope you can get to the point to forgive yourself...
I STAND w/ u Will. ❤️ I just want to give Will a HUGE HUG!  I know it won’t solve anything, but he’s only human, & we all make mistakes!  I PRAY that him & Chris can heal their hearts & this is a GOOD step in that direction.  ❤️
The Humility was genuine
yaaah its willard time
Hope he is growing from this, but at least it seems genuine to me.
This is how you do a "apology video." No bullshit, full accountability and then we can move on from there. However, I hate that this world is now at a point where this still isn't enough for people. Much love Will. You got this no matter what happens.
I have now respect for you and wish you luck!
I stand with you Will!!
I have always admired you and your work. You have immense talent and worked really hard all your life to be the best person. Clearly what you did was a signal of deep anger and frustration at yourself, and took it out on someone else publicly. You will be paying the price of this for the rest of your life. How daunting that must feel - to have made a drastic error, so publicly, knowing you hurt many others and yourself, and that in many cases - that consequences of that error are irreparable. One thing I had belief about- that you would go to deep self-work to learn what the hell happened that led you to that fateful behavior - at the very pinnacle of success in your career. What a moment of self-sabotage. But you will always be a role model to me because I believe you will use this breakdown to have a breakthrough, that you will learn from it and through you we all will have a chance to learn too.
God bless you Will. You are not what you did in that moment. God has had me pray for you in particular and I was suppose to pray for you before that incident happened. So I apologize and commit to continue praying for you and your family. Better is on the way!!! Thank you for this sign that prayer works to God be the glory.
I'm still a fan. Bad boys for life. 🤘🇦🇺🤘
The prophet peace be upon him said the strong one is the one who could control himself when he id angry
I’ve always had respect for you Will, and although I don’t agree with what you did at the Oscar’s, I respect you for making this video ✊🏾
No one is perfect. You have worked hard to perfect your craft, and even hard to heal yourself. Much respect ❤️
Why? You haven’t answered WHY you did it?
Love you and still hanging with you Will !!!! Take care.
Will ❤🙏🏾💪🏾.  Glad that you're getting the help you need to go forward. I hope Chris reaches back to you. 🙏🏾 peace & blessings.
Will check out Andrew Tate (Top G) videos for good advices
you're a real and true man. you're so respectable and you have always been my idol and my role model. you're a genuine good person. i love you.
❤
I love you Will, and I'm with the school of thought that when one reaches their ultimate height of recognition, something will always come to bring them down. You fell but  you shall not stay fallen, you will rise again, keep your head up, we love and support you, keep your head up 💞💞💞💞
❤️❤️❤️ ALWAYS Will Smith❤️❤️❤️
You're still one of my favorite actors. We all do things we regret but it's how we learn and grow from them that shows the character that we truly have. Mr. Smith continue to go grow as a human being and forgive yourself to be able to shine your unique light in this world again.
I hope you two can reconcile after all of this. You're both living legends and the culture needs the both of you. 👑👑
Nothing but love for Will Smith.  Takes a real grown up to admit when they were wrong and he handled this with class.  Love Chris too.  These two ought to show that they have fixed this over a new comedy movie or something.   I’ll buy it right now sight unseen.
Dope. 🙏🏾
I'm with you Will. This will pass and good will come out of this.
Accept the past, embrace the future...
Still an incredible actor and person, don’t stress it, I’m sure you not anymore and that’s the right thing to do 🔝

Don’t be sad and you’re not a piece of poop  We make mistakes  We know you’re a good fella  Relax now  You done what you had to do  Now take some time  Be thankful buddy and  We’re here
That evening was the best and worst night in your career Will..... Very sad but we are human after all.
Hi Will 👍
Well said Will let’s forget about what happened and let’s move forward can’t wait to see what you have in the future for us
Love you Will, mistakes have been made by everyone in the world so I completely understand. Even you can come back from this! We know your heart
So glad to hear from you. I really missed you. You're a good person. Just one issue won't make me hate you.
It's time to heal🥺🙂
Ngl this probably should’ve been a little longer
Welcome back to the world Will. We need you and miss you man. You're only human & displayed a human emotion. You've asked to be forgiven & you acknowledged your wrongs. The only acceptable apology is changed behavior as I'm sure we'll all be able to move on from this. I salute you.
I forgive you
Thank you Will. We love you. 🙏🏾👑
We Love You Will💕👑🙏🏾
This is how you do an apology video
Always have been and will remain an inspiration to me Will. Love you Man!
Love you Will, stay Strong
Will Smith release all the alien footage u have
Love you Will! ❤
Will, it was just a moment. Breathe 😮‍💨 and live again. I’m sending you all my love and healing energy. 💜
We love you Will ❤️❤️❤️
I love you Will and Chris both! ❤️
love you will keep your head up.
I'm sorry means you know what you did was wrong and will do everything you can to make sure it never happens again. Thank you for owning your mistake without making excuses. I am proud of your effort. I hope everyone affected can heal. Let's all move forward.
Dang… ur choice of words are very well thought out… I also still think ur a great person and that you will heal from this
We all love you man ❤ Take care everything will be fine ❤
It’s really good to see you Will.
Welcome back G.
I dint know what to say. I see the pain but I see and feel Chris' pain. I am confused about the whole thing.
Will, you are an outstanding Gentleman.  Stay Blessed,  full of light and love. 🌻🤲🏾🧎🏾‍♀️
Your first step in righting your wrong is to accept responsibility for your actions, which you have done and I applaud you for it. Not many people in your position with your status has that intestinal fortitude to do so. This will likely be one of the biggest obstacles you will find difficult to overcome, but with patience, diligence and consistency you will overcome. Good luck and you still have us out here who support you and will continue to do so.
Thank you for this Will. All love man, take care of yourself. You're awesome
man you did a tremendous job 😉
Uh oh
No one is perfect. It's how we lean from our short comings and rise above that speaks to our character. Take as much time you need to heal, and better yourself. Your still a great human being in my book.
Divorce that woman and you will be fine
THIS is why we love Will Smith
I think this is the best, no-nonsense, sincere apology video I've ever seen.
but hey he did make a good meme out it
will I'm sure people will forgive you we all make mistakes its apart of our evolution
Mistakes don't make sure or define us,  how we handle them do.  You may never see this but keep going, growing and inspiring!!! Thank you
No King dont be like that. Yes you are human and mistakes are inevitable, but dont make yourself this broken from inside. You are the realist man in the world pure in and out. Love you and bless you King.❤
❤️
It's ok we're all human,we all make mistakes. We have all had people we had there back through thick and thin. Learn from your mistakes and move on. That's all we can do. You did a bad thing,but you're not a bad person. Take it easy on yourself man. The internet is a sh't show. Let's get better and back to being the good person I know you are. Before the incident you was good. Let's just get back on the right track. 👍
nobody is perfect. And neither do you, dear Will! No one can claim to do everything right all the time. We all make mistakes. True greatness is admitting a mistake, and that's all that matters. and you own your mistakes. And I stand by you
Will, it was a mistake.  You've apologized and if the world can't get pass it then forget them.  You owe us nothing.
Take your time and heal we are humans after all we all make mistakes wish you all the best BIG WILL ❤️ we love you and can’t wait for your next big Movie
💜💜💜
Shame should not be a part of our identity.  We can be ashamed of our actions, but being ashamed of ourselves is probably destructive
God has the last say in everything we do! HE will not judge you, so who gives anyone else the right to. We love you Will!
❤️🙏🏽
You are NOT a POS…. I’m a long time fan we still got love for you! Everybody makes mistakes …great to see you trying to make amends and STILL be our hero…and our fresh Prine💕
Sorry Will, but it’s really not the time to be working on your brand and image with a public apology. This needs to happen behind closed doors otherwise it’s just disrespectful to those you impacted with your actions. This is just self serving.
In the right time, things between yourself and Chris, will be sorted and you both will continue doing what you do best which is ENTERTAINING, making people laugh and life will carry on!
If I was will smith I woulda smacked em wit stick
Only real man can apologize for something they did wrong in front of millions 🫶🏽
we accept your apology though it was funny. let's hope Chris moves on
Nobody is infallible, Will.  You are an incredibly positive person, full of love and caring.  One mistake does not define who you are as a person and actor.  We still love and admire you.  You say it is irreparable.  Oh please!  It is not irreparable.  Show me a perfect person.  There is none.  Your words are waaaaaay too harsh on yourself.  People of your caibre in the industry have done way worse so don't be too hard on yourself.  Sending you and your family loving and positive vibes.  Walk with God.
We love you . Big Will.
I have alopecia and I would have been ashamed if someone made fun of me on national TV. You have your own life none should be put that burden on you to live up to strangers expectations.
Praying for you Will🙏🏽...I'm also praying all the parties that this incident affected🙏🏽...I'm praying for healing🙏🏽between you and Chris...In time...true hearts will accept your apologies and let it go. I still love you and will forever be a fan. Blessings to you and your family.♥️
You didn't let us down! You are allowed your humanity. Thank you for caring enough to apologize & caring about how we feel in spite of what you are going through. You got a friend here, always. I hope you heal from this. Remember, you are loved, seen, & heard. This storm will pass over soon. Take your time & get better.
I’m proud of you without the apology!
YES! He made a HUGE and distasteful mistake but that was it. A MISTAKE, he is a human, and he doesn’t have a history of being a bad person. He IS a good person, admirable even. So he’s doing he’s work. Let’s all heal. I will always support you. 💛
Cool
Whatever you did then.... Was absolutely right..... What you are doing now is also right..... You are a beautiful person
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is my boy! His integrity is impeccable! No one can be perfect but moving with good intentions, reflection and growth is the key! Will you are the G.O.A.T always setting the bar. Thanks for being transparent and sharing what healthy self development looks like.
You are still loved by those that know your heart Will. I know if you could go back you would have handled things very differently. It's good to see you again Will. 😊
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself...I'm human...I made a mistake"  A reminder that self-love is always important, even when we F up.
Cool
Much respect man. It takes a lot to admit wrongs but even more to grow from them. I’ll forever be a fan.
Everybody makes mistakes but a lot of us have the luxury of not having ours broadcasted on national television. I respect you and still think you’re one of the best black men I’ve never met. I’m praying for you, Chris and everyone involved. 🙏🏽❤️
A Real King/Man on this Earth.🙌🏾🙏🏾✊🏾💪🏾
Time heals all..if you allow it. So.glad that that you were not only accountable, but remorseful. You're still good in my book. Take care of yourself.
The goat ❤️❤️❤️ we support you during your healing
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
"I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself" THAT'S the place to be! It is NOT the totality of who you are. Grace..
You have taken 100% ownership. You are human. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come.
Never gave up on you buddy. I’m glad you took time to think this out. I’m happy to see the light in your eyes returning. You got this continue your healing journey and may Chris recover and become whole as well.
I still love you, Will. I still believe you are a great guy ❤️
SMACK US WITH SOME TURTH!!!! 🧑🏿‍🦱👋🏾
Will it's ok, nobody is perfect you will always be one of my favorite actors and it takes courage to do this...much love from Kissimmee Florida
Out of all of this I wish to say just one thing.. thank you for the memes.
We all have our moments of anger and mistakes. That what makes us humans. It takes a real courage to say what you said. All respect man ✊
We all wanted to hear you say what you just said. You are human and you know what you did. That is a win
Thank God for grace. You are exceptional and the world is learning it. Welcome back Will
🙏🙏
You're a human being. I can remember irobot people make mistakes. You didn't lose any respect from me and didn't take anything away from just how awesome you are
Most of us have been following you and Chris and so much more. 30 years and this is the first public slip up ever. Nothing is irreparable , y'all got this.
Whats done is done, love u Will 🖤
Not everyone will come up or own up to their mistakes and bad behaviors, Respect to that Will. I know Amber heard can’t relate😂🤣
Respect
Willard Smith….. we love you and appreciate hearing your voice in the topic. 💙
Respect to you that you realize your mistake. We are all human and we all make mistakes. Blessings to you and your family.
That "My Dark, Jiggy Fantasy" album gonna be fuego.
we are only humans after all....
Es humano y toda la cosa , pero ya su imagen para mí no es la misma ,tenía un buen concepto del sr y ahora ya me da igual lo que diga o haga ...saludos
❤️
I am sorry but this man is beautiful. He did a fucked up thing. But he will, WILL stay one of my biggest inspiration. Prouv is... Even the most admirable man can do things that now one expected. Nobody either him ask for forgiveness he know he went to far. But you can still admire someone knowing you have something in your heart towards him.  He is human, we are and we are all fucked up sometimes. Just because he his a role model for many as me and have duties without wanted it but he knows. Doesn't makes me not even a bit ashamed to say that I love Will Smith
This took courage!! We are all work in progress! This is an example of how our image and understanding of people is so fragile, and we have to remember to be gentle with ourselves and others. Thanks Will!
This is real life Hancock
❤❤❤❤❤
He sped past the actual person he was supposed to be  apologizing  to.   Don't say sorry if you don't wanna !
We miss you Will; I hope everything will be better. ❤️
Nah....Fresh Prince not King b4 happy Chris WON....tony and them waiting for you....lmfao   Ur voice play the lion on wizard of OZ  In west Philly born and raised 🙌🏾 lmfao ♥️ U know u f up right
I'm still shocked that a fine gentleman that you are MANAGED to get caught up in a very stupid stunt such as that...So so CHILDISH...I hope that with constant time that some are healing after that petty DRAMA.....👀 I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER/CLASSIER than that.....😶😏😒
Bro, you got King Kong balls for this. Mental health is something we all take for granted. What’s weird is that there is something that happens to us, like an out of body moment, and you see how people are all reacting to you. It’s the worst. What makes you great is that you’re addressing and doing. Most importantly, you’re fuckin human! Because all of us have fucked up even worse than this! Attain that mental peace my brother!
Apologie accepted, now release a new movie godamn
YAAAAAAAYYYYYY WE MISS YOU Sir, I KNOW I DO & LOVE YOU. SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU I SWEAR 💪🏿👑🤗
🙏🏾
어차피 시간은 흘러가고 이젠 다 과거가 된 이야기. 그래도 인정하고 사과하는 모습은 보기 좋아요. 진심은 언제나 통하는것!! 응원할게요
Peace and love ❤️
Will,  you're still loved ❤️❤️❤️❤️

I was shocked but not disappointed.  You are human!   We have all made mistakes.  Just learn from it and continue to grow as a person.  Wish you healing! 🙏🏽
Will has been through enough
Check out the book “The Body Keeps the Score”. It’s validating and explains a ton. Sending love.
Still da goat 🐐
🤍🤍
❤️
I understand that feeling of feeling like I let people down. It's definitely crippling. But I learned to tell myself I am human, I make mistakes, making mistakes helps  me to become a better person. ❤
We missed u Will, ty for coming back!
w apology
We all mistakes but let's get over this! We want to see content and new movies coming up! ❤️
I always support you, Mr Will Smith. Take your time. I will always wait for Mr Will Smith to return. Put your happiness, first. When Mr Will Smith happy, I am happier. Nothing in this world is matter than to see Mr Will Smith is happy. The days not always yellow, it can be gray, too. But the sun always shines and never too late. Let's start a new beginning. ☺️💛 I love you, Mr Will Smith. If you need a time to heal, there always be a time. You need a hug? I hug Mr Will Smith, right now. Cheer up, Sir. 🌹
You should be forgiven. Come to Jesus and repent. You will be forgiven.
Please keep remembering you're human. We all make mistakes. Thank God for Grace. May God bless you and cover you. I pray your for your mental. ❤️ You're a good person who made a mistake. ❤️🙏🏽❤️ Heal
WE FORGAVE MIKE HE BIT EVANDERS EAR     OFF WE BLACK ,WE MESS UP , WE LOVE, HARD, WE FIGHT HARD, NOBODIES PERFECT; WE LOVE CHRIS , WE LOVE YOU WILL ; ALLS FORGIVEN PUSH THROUGH ✊🏿❤️🙏🏿
Wow this was really heartfelt. He seems like he's done a lot of work and had a lot of growth over these past few months.
I know everything will be alright Willy. Just we also thinking about also the movies will released or not? I am legend or some others. We will be happy to see you on screen again! Big Love and Respect🖤
You still have fans. And we love you Will.
Me and my homies fought and made up. I understand the stage but. This is only not fixed because of pride. You were wrong. You admitted it. Forgiveness is hard. But not impossible. I would like to hope Chris is capable. Balls in his court. As long as this is not reoccurring there’s nothing wrong with forgiveness
Who cares move on. That illuminate a mofo lol
🥰❤️💯
You’re amazing Will and you will stay amazing 🙏🏽, legend stay a legend role model and friend (even you don’t know me 😅😉)
We still love will real talk
Here when 6000 views
Thank you sir.  😊
We all make mistakes, your still my hero!!!
2nd chances are not only given. They’re earned. Humans make mistakes everyday. It takes a strong soul to forgive something that SEEMS unforgivable. It takes an even stronger soul to admit to the masses that they were wrong without making a bunch of excuses. This world was built to make mistakes. We learn from them. We grow from them. We move on from them and continue to pour out as much love and positivity as we humanly can.
Accountability......That's all you can ask for
This made me cry, Will. I’m a therapist and I hope you work through what triggers caused your fight response to take over. Your healing is important too.
It’s not your fault
love you💙
Wishing you healing, Will.
I just wish I could actually meet you and give you a hug, Will. Not happy for what you did nor claim to understand the things and experiences that brought you to do this, but I just know we all stumble, and stumble bad sometimes... Not to sound sympathetic with your acts, but I am truly and really sympathetic to you as a person, like a family member that you know is purely and truly good on the inside. I'm happy you're separating between blaming your act and ultimately being harsh to your own self, I respect that, and I will keep waiting for anything new you do. Nothing but love and respect, from a devoted fan from Egypt 😊🇪🇬
And I'm ready to see will back, we can be friends again but tbh I got over it a couple months ago
C R I N G E 😬
We love you Will!  Thanks for share this,  we are here always for you ❤️❤️❤️
It’s ok buddy, wish you the best and happiness. Everyone have its own problems, it can happen, don’t need to over react. We’re with you for ever bro, you’re the best.  We’ll go through that w/ you 💪
It’s passed bro. You apologized. Chin up. I mean it’s way more things going on in the world that we won’t get an apology. Gas prices and the recession. We won’t get an apology. Police brutality we won’t get an apology. All these shootings we won’t get an apology. We love you bro. It’s done. Smile. Be strong. 👑👑

Will - There’s a root cause for the problem, and that root cause has made you jaded… at this point.
Much love and respect will. Be safe ❤️
Will we Love you man! 🙏🏻
Being remorseful without being ashamed! That's a really good way to put it, we all make mistakes
we love you darlin!
Love you, Will. Your journey has brought me so much joy over the years and I’m not jumping off the train 🚊 over this. Also your book 📕 was amazing. God bless you
I'm hanging on buddy
We all love you and everyone that had negative things to say a while ago, don't get it. But I am strong support of you Will, and will always back you.  You are a real role model and aspiration to a lot of us still.
Sir will. We are all human.  You have suffered the consequences and still do. Try to forgive yourself first. Let the guilt go. Give yourself another chance ✨️. Your true fan's will always stay and support you. I defendant you personally,  you are a role model to millions.  I didn't support your actions at that moment. But pray to your God and keeping on going 🙏 love ❤️ you always ❤️.
"I apologize" is not the same as saying "I'm sorry".
💗🌠🌼
Did you do what you did to gain more views for the show

Tou problème c'est ta femme elle est manipuler
You the man and your honourable
You made a mistake like everyone of us do, taken responsibility of your actions is the right thing to do, but don't beat yourself up for it cause I can tell that's what your doing, your apology is sincere, it's time to put this behind you and continue your journey , you have great things to move on to,  are mistakes are meant to happen, that's what makes us who we are... LIVE WILL ❤
I have nothing but love for both of you guys , I wish to see ya be friends again, no one is perfect, stay up Will
✊🏾💯🖤
Позор. Какое безумное время наступило. Человек заступился за честь своей женщины, а общество заставило его извиниться за то, что он был мужчиной. Крис - ты жалкий. И Уилл жалкий. Я тебя очень уважал за этот поступок.
Max verstappen is the greatest driver of all time
Fair play, the video was straight to the point, no unnecessary exaggerated emotions displayed, it's fine man let's all just move on I believe chris will forgive you he's a good lad himself
What a Hancock
Sincere Request for Forgiveness.    We are NOT perfect….
Welcome back, Will!
Força  will  smith 💯🙏
Its ok its okay amigo u will move forward as u always have done!!! 👍 ❤️
He’s human get over it people snap
Always 💯
" There's no perfect human" all the best to you and Cris🙏 ❤️ ♥️ 💙 💖 💕
He is a good actor !! Proved
Proud of him for trying to apologize and do better. It feels like this happened so long ago for us, but I know he must still be right in that fallout.
Fuzzy...lmao
I'm feeling like I'm finally getting a grip on my life after three months of heartbreak after losing the first dog I've ever loved as much as i did. my girlfriend and i still talk a lot about him and cry about him to this day, but around the same time this incident happened, his health went downhill and fast. that's not the important part, even though it still hurts. we get better day by day, we just have to keep moving forward and bettering ourselves everyday. thank you very much for answering our questions Mr. Will. mistakes happen, but the actions we take to better them and never let them happen again is what makes us better. good luck on your end.
Ojala suban este video en español
We LUV you Will
Very genuine 👏🏼 continue your healing. Proud of you, this isn’t easy but we’re all human.
Indeed.
It’s ok will we understand.
Take care Will, wishing you the best.
Just leave this damn woman she is making the worst out of you!

Being humble that was beautiful 🖤

🌹🌹
Love you, Will! The accountability you have taken is inspiring, because at some point in life we have ALL been the villain in someone else's narrative. Thank you for the privilege you've given us of sharing your very personal and difficult healing journey.
You've earned forgiveness. A second chance. You've handled yourself beautifully over your entire career. That was an unfortunate snap moment. You never like to see it for someone. You definitely don't want to see it on such a triumphant night, but sometimes we lose it. I hate that your moment happened on national television on a momentous day for you. You still have my support.
I really hope you are doing therapy to examine your inner most turmoil that you were clearly going through. I wish you the best
You're a good guy who made a mistake, that's all. More power to you 🙌🏽
Uncle Will please come back
Will always looks like hes about to cry
This bout to have like 10 million
Your sins are forgiven. God loves you. Be fruitful and multiply in the name of Jesus Christ. AMEN
Your a legend will. We all make choices sometimes good it bad, we are only human. My respect for you never changed. ✌️❤️
Much respect 🙏 keep your head up
I hope you can heal because I feel that all the people who should have supported you have not helped you heal.
Love you bro
Can’t wait for Chris and will to become friends again.🥹💯🙏🏿
It’s OK Will Smith
One thing Will, you have seen who your friends are when you have made mistakes.

Force à Will Smith, meilleur acteur américain
I saw people say you showed your true colors and I felt the exact opposite that you acted out of color, that something was going on because it was out of character for you. I know you take this very seriously and do your best to understand it so it doesn't surface again and for that I'm proud of you for choosing growth instead of ego. Hope you work through this and feel better, glad to see you again. <3
Heeey Will! ❤️ Welcome back….Prayerfully u both can HEAL & move on.  Love u BOTH! ❤️❤️
I've waited so long for this
We not all perfect bro salute 🫡 to you

You’re forever my childhood hero 🖤
Sometimes darkness is a light skinded woman. -Neitzsche

Love and respect to my legend. ...u did great on the video...thank you to showcase and made us that we respect and kept you in our hearts for a reason....thank you
If hurt had a voice, you can hear it now. His action has broken him. The shame has already taken over the remorse. It will be a hard battle for him. It will take time but I am in his corner. He is a great individual.
Respect ❤️
We missed you Will.
Yesssss I been waiting to hear from my HERO!!!!!! YOU ARE STILL MY HERO!!!!!

H!
Alguem pode traduzir por favor 🇧🇷
Hey we still love you no matter what will!❤️
It’s good to see that you’ve taken time away from the spotlight. At the end of the day, it was a stupid mistake and we should give people like Will a chance for forgiveness.
Welcome back! We missed you! My sons look up to you! Everyone makes mistakes and happy to see you back 🙏🏾

This is why I Love Will Smith no one's perfect
It’s good bro it’s alright I’m happy that your back.
🙋‍♀️ 🙇‍♂️
We love you Will.💓
no grammy award?
We all make mistakes, we’re just in a time where people don’t allow people to make mistakes and learn from them. Your years of good work that you’ve done aren’t going with just one bad action you still have a lot of people who respect and love you! That being said it’s good to know that you are taking accountability for your wrongdoing.
We love and support you Will. Everybody makes mistakes, you are still one heck of a guy 🤟
Are you OK?
Its good to see you again.
Great to see you back Will💪🏾💪🏾
Lose that weight off of your life and career. That person is weighing you down and you deserve better.
I’ve never click a video so fast!
Uncle will also this even I have been really stressed 😩and I honestly just had to cry last night so please take care of yourself unc I love you so much 💓
You didn't do anything wrong
How quick did everyone get here when saw this video
We missed ya!
You are legend to me forever we all make mistakes but the hardest thing to do is accepting the mistakes we make
Will
Glad to see you moving forward!
Love for that
Love you Will ❤️❤️❤️
Woah, hello there. 😶
Very happy to see you back!!  You are a good person at your core. You are worthy. You made a mistake and you are forgiven. You’ve taken all the steps to correct your wrongs in this situation. We love and respect you Will❤️❤️❤️❤️
Salute
Welcome back Will.  I feel your heartfelt sorrow and sincere apology.  Others should as well.  Hopefully, Chris can forgive and resume the friendship.  But if he can’t, you’ve forgiven yourself and must let go.
Mega millions is at 1 billion today hopefully I win let’s see if this comment ages well 😂😭
Its not his first time and not the last one 😂
We love you 😍
We love you Will!!!!!!
We missed you!!!!!

Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
such a genuine man.
you'll get over this stronger than ever before.
Hol' on
He’s still the goat
You’re the man Will Smith, God bless you, happy to see you post again 😊
Hypocrite.
Acting people, acting.
Love you Will 💙🙏🏽
This man made my childhood
1.1K in 4 mins! That’s crazy
You're still good Will
Hello Mr Smith 💜💜💜💜
Glad to see you back
Love Will!!! Healing & Blessings!!❤️❤️
❤️💯
Love you will u will always be the goat in many eyes man
Love you will❤️
We love you!!!!!!!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!! Enough is enough! Stop beating yourself up! You've apologized and people either accept it or they don't that's up to them. We constantly ask God (or whoever you believe in yourself included) for forgiveness but we don't grant others the same courtesy. You've done your part. That said is anyone else ready for Bad Boys 4 and the sequel to Bright????????
We missed you will so much ❤️
What you did was deplorable. You messed up your own biggest night for what? It's truly sad, you used to be one of my heroes. 'Nuances' 'complexities' are all nothingburger words. You preached peace and goodwill and you go and do something as hypocritical as this.
This is all horrible
Oh man….
Love you will❤️
Well, super balls
Welcome back big dawg
Awwww man i missed you ❤️you’re birthday is coming up soon ❤️ the ending made me sad 😢 we will always be friends #Libra-gang

Respect the honesty Will.
It’s not your fault mate we all make mistakes in the past but we learn from them
❤️❤️❤️❤️
L bozo
Wow will 😭😭😭🥺
If you haven't left her then the power you had will never be the same. She has the power of the family now. When they think of the smiths now. They will be thinking of her and not you. It was all her fault if you don't know that then most likely something else will happen revolving around her.
Big willie style 😎
Welcome back champ
Lots of love and light to you Will
