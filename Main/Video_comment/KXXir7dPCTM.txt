Literally cried watching this and about the ring he did that 😍 ugh you deserve it and we all deserve this ladies never settle for les🥺🥺
Broooo shout to Rey cause wtf is Santea and Jose wearing 🤣😩🤨
Stopp bc paus scene made me tear…she was real close to the ring too
And this is for the Valentina haters saying she always takes Jayco, try getting rid of her now 😜😜😜
Damn Kevin and Gero ain’t make it
Not the Selfish singing 😂
I love the way val explains her story 😂❤ congratulations you both!
I wanna go to the wedding 🙏🏼
why is no one talking about how Val has depersonalization/derealization & even if it’s a happy moment it can still trigger it
where’s the reaction vidddd
The cantinflas mustache😆😆
i love nat😭😂 she’s so effortlessly funny
valentina is sooo cute🥺🥺🥺
when jose and santea started singing 😭😭
“Why we talking about pnb”😂 but fr rip<3
pau is me sobbing 😂😭
All of these videos made me cryyyyyyy
15:25 Pau is so adorable for that 🫶🏼
6:17 asking Valeria If she knew about  this 😭😭
3:12 can never have a serious moment with these ones 😹😹
I love how y’all included your convo in the car of the feelings that went thru your head and self during the proposal it really gave a comforting feeling and real side of you guys the whole convo was so cute, love yall and putting God first in your relationship gives me certainty in your futures🤍
aint bros milking this engagement video💀💀💀 i cant even imagine how many videos he gon make for the wedding☠️☠️☠️☠️
bro is trending
ALL FAKE AND STAGED
NOBODY CARES
Baby goat is my mood 24/7 😂
WHERES GEROOO?
These videos are so good, really thank you for all the time you put into making them, would you ever consider doing a video of tips youve learned playing as a brim main? Even the niche ones would be very cool to check out. Keep up the great work :o
The way she tossed that Prada bag lmao
11:44 WHAT ARE YOU DOING BRUH?! lmfao had to sub. congrats to you both hahaha
She’s so cute ❤
When Santea mocked Jose’s reaction 🤚🏼😂😂😂
“I’m a fiancé” 🥹 the fact that I feel like I’m never gonna say those words 😭
Nobody cares. Grow up
Coming soon video: "Why we broke up"
Jayco you did a beautiful job those words came from the holy spirit god bless you and Valentina
I really believe the unexplainable feeling the guys are describing was God's presence!! God is so good and he was definitely there with you Jayco and Val in this beautiful moment of unity. God's always there!!! <3
I don’t know if it was just me but Valeria (her sister) gives off pick me vibes :/
“No ticket let’s gooo.. god always comes through “ 😂😂

You already know what the boys felt....Holy Spirit <3 Jesus is all over you guysss!
Santi gonna be best man I know it  “Santi , Jayco needs you 🏃🏻
I thought what you said during the proposal was pretty 👍 for being nervous and going blank
It is so satisfying to have been apart of this chapter in your life! This November will be my one year anniversary of finding yalls channel and so much stuff has happened since. From you guys getting an apartment to getting married. Congratulations Jayco and Valentina! May God Guide your marriage!!! 🙏🏼 🎊
Is it just me but when the boys are explaining what their feeling it kinda sounds like the Holy Spirit ?!? Maybe
Val looked so happy talking about everything she felt before the proposal and when she first saw the sign. i’m so happy for y’all !
God was in everyone’s presence cause god knows when someone promises marriage is something special to him and the man proposing ❤ god himself said a man needs a woman just how a woman needs a man. Man will leave his family for the right woman!!
oooooh love 🥹
I love how happy and excited she looks
