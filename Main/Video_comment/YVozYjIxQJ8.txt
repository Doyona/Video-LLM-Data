67
I love her so much
So bloody talented!
ToMoRrOw, ToMoRrOw, I'll lOvE yA tOmOrRoW yOu'Re OnLy A dAy AwAy
Shes the perfekt max❤
W have bluebell in Australia
8:55 - "and my mom was like: fly away, be free!" - Sadie  idk why but that just made my chest ache and felt a huge wave of sadness and wholesomeness wash over me omg, and that being one of the last things she said in this interview, it gave me shivers but still idk why
Bro I actually it’s sombr on the cover
i swear sadie and gaten don’t age
Ela tem que conhecer a dubladora dela em português!
2:56 I can’t stop listening to this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love finn
I love Sadie sink

You guys she’s so pure! She’s so…no words she is awesome!
Nah my school had a Annie show in May
2:18 same girl same
1:39 bro I watched it in a day
Top 3 fav person
She is so talented
i love finn and sadie ❤❤❤
She could be Aloy in the upcoming Horizon movie if Hannah doesn’t feel confident with her accent
I don’t know why but it destroys me to realize that the cast of one of my fav shows of all time play characters about the same age or maybe a bit younger as me but in reality they are all like 5 years older than me and it makes me f*cking sad😢😢
Bro gained like 500 sub's in a day
1:50
SADIEE:)
I know I’m commenting in 2025, but… this reminds me of a movie that MY FRIEND is in.
Funny how Finn was her first friend on set but didn’t wanted her in the party in the show 😭
Adorable
Uhhhh, first everything huh...? Weird title
Before 2022 I wasn’t the biggest Max fan but I still liked her, & then in season 4…!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Max your my favorite character
She is the sweetest person ever ❤
I loved her performance in stranger things and more I love Sadie all around!
You are attractive ❤❤❤
The accent before  3:22
I love mint chocolate chip
I love you Sadie Sink
Sadie slays ❤❤❤
😂😂😂 lol
If someone told me she was 15, id believe them 😭 I love sadie sm 😩😩
Mint chocolate chip is the best flavour
1:40 OMG SAME!
Actually she act better than millie 😂  Nowadays millie only focus on branding not in acting
I love mint chocolate chip ❤❤❤❤
IM SUCH A HUGE FANNNNNNNN
4:48 Gaten😭😭
4:48 gates😭😭😭
0:38 her face when she said that sentence had me dying on the floor😂
tbh im so obsessed with Nancy and when season 4 ended I got this very weird weird WEIRD and sad SAD feeling and want to see Nancy so SOO bad in season 5 already and it’s making me feel so weird and I hate it tbh. Anyone know how to get rid of my obsession?
Sadie is one of my favorite actors I love her so much I hope to grow up and be just like her ❤
, 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓🥰🥰🥰
I love how Sadie reminds me of drew berymore for some reason. Also I love mint chocolate chip 😀
You are so beautiful. I always liked 3 seasons of Stranger Things with Billy. Sometimes Max told us about her friends when Dustin back. She liked 11 for hanging out for a while
her acting is incredible
Nobody gonna talk abt how Sadie's hair looks like a literal pantene advert 🤩
Guys he honest who died for 15 seconds when you remembered that caleb was her first kiss👇
I wish I could be an actor but it's hard to try because we'll, there really isn't anything to audition
She’s in my top 5 favourite characters
I think she is going to be more successful than 11.
i dont like this title
Who else loves Stranger Things! And Sadie is so pretty ❤❤❤😊😊😊
Sadi is very gorgeous
4:10 …
I watched season 4 in 8 days
i never knew that they were freshman’s in highschool for s4 until my sister told me after i had watched it like 2 times (i skipped a lot of it because i was doing homework both times) and i was so surprised. max was genuinely the only one who looked like a freshman. mike looked like a full on junior and same for lucas. dustin looked like he was in between a sophomore and a freshman. but will and eleven looked like they were at the end of junior year. it’s crazy.
I looooveee her
❤🎉
I love here so much 🎉😂
Wasn’t her first scene the classroom one not the Halloween one?
Pink 🥹
My name is Sadie too I have literally never met anybody named Sadie bro.
It’s ironic that max hates mike but Sadie’s best friend is Finn who plays mike ❤❤❤
So cute Sadie!!!!
i love mint cholick
I could watch her talk about anything, she’s so genuine
MAX YOUR MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN STRANGER THINGS
She is 20 but looks 12.  Feels like jailbait, even tho it's not 💀
She absolutely knocked it out of the park in season 4! So nice to see such a talented actress who seems to be so sweet, mature and down to earth in real life! Hope to see more of her after stranger things!
i dont even knos her age and she looks young
It's so much fun, just watching sadie
Beautiful❤
I’ve seen this a few times

Sadie's maturity reminds me of Emma Watson. Looking forward to more of Sadie's wonderful performances.
You are my favorite character in stranger things max
Pretty much mature for her age! A real little Lady!
So happy Sadie is getting the praise she deserves. She's one of the best actresses around rn!!

Stranger Things made Sadie Sink popular.
It's SOOOOO cool you killed it
I actually thought he could be as good as millie playing EL in this series or could be better,cause she have this aura in her as an actor for a leading role..she got this x factor in her

😡😡😡😡
Sadie your my idol I wish I could meet you!
i love mint chip aswell.your not alone! XD
0:49 In that part his voice is funny jajaja
Sadie is so prettyy 😍 💓 💖 💗 💛
“do i look like a little girl? 😡😡😡”
in stranger things i saw that Max (Sadie) looked older than Eleven (Millie) but i then saw a picture of them together and Eleven/Millie looked older, i thought that Max/Sadie was like 15-16 years but turns out she was 20 when i last checked on Google
the first time i felt like a real adult was when i got my first job i was actually bringing in money and i have my own account and everything i get my own paycheck and with that i am able to buy stuff for myself and i have always wanted to do that so i am pretty proud of that
i auditioned for the voice once i saw like a little ad on Instagram and i tried out for it and i didn't get in unfortunately but i did the take they saw it and they said we are so sorry but you didn't get in so i was sad but eventually i got over it
my first big purchase was my laptop I have always wanted one I saved up my money and it took like a year and a half but i finally got it and have one now for myself i am pretty happy with myself i worked really hard to get it.
the first time i got on a skateboard was i remember i was like 14 maybe 13 and i was at my friend's house and he had a skateboard and i wanted to try it and i did it was pretty scary though i didn't want to fall off or hurt myself he showed me a couple of times how to do it but i was still pretty scared i think i just sat on it and rolled down the driveway pretty much that's it i haven't been on one ever since
and i did take the advice
first famous person that followed me was geez there is a lot one of them was That Girl Lay Lay who is a famous teen rap star I love her BTW so talented i don't think she was the first but she was a famous person that followed me
i haven't really had any real dates i have had boyfriends yes but if i am being honest if i had any dates it was probably a virtual one we watched a movie over face time together or something and chatted this was during the pandemic so
actually i think it was grilled cheese not pasta
first thing i learned how to cook was probably pasta then i started experimenting with other foods i feel like i have gotten better tbh
my first show was rats and we also did Annie I loved Annie as a kid
my first dream that came true was going to Disneyland I have literally always dreamed and wanted to go there and i finally did my parents let me go it was a school choir field trip and we all went to Disneyland and that was in 7th grade i was 12 omg i remember i was so excited
my first audition for rats idk if i felt nervous or not i don't think i was nervous i think i was excited just a little happy excited kid haha
the first thing people get wrong about me is probably my age or my gender I get told that I am like 14 15 or 16 I'm not I am 19 years old so yeah also I get called a boy a lot because my hair is short and i don't always dress girly but I am not a boy I am a girl clearly.
my first audition was in 4th grade with my choir mates i was in choir and we auditioned for this musical called rats it was pretty fun we were so tiny then wow
my first friend was probably in pre-k we used to have classes together and were friends i don't know where she is now but she was my first friend
I love mint chocolate chip ice cream who doesn’t?
Now alanta is where people have to go but I live close soi would not have to go Maybe u hope so
Please make a video like this with Noah and Sadie too. My two favorite characters
My fav character is actually Sadie aka max
I wanna marry and have sooooooo many kids with her.😍🤗🥰😆💥🌋
0:43 why does this make me wanna die
I am 10 and Then she Got blind i was sceret i see this and i just Watch it now
Oi
at 2:56 she properly sounds like max
I know how to cook a lot of foods and I'm only 8
I would like to know how it was for her at school because she was probably always looked at or spoken to by everyone
"do i look like a little girl"
How must her friends have reacted when they saw that she was in Stranger Things😂 a question I can't get out of my head
I thought here and Caleb were friends first
Is there any chance you can contact Sadie Sink ,if yes then how? I would really love to talk to her
🖐
If Sadie thinks mint choc chip should be a flavour, it's stayin a flavour.
She's going places
I think her and Finn liked each other
how is sadie 20 years old
my friend litrey loves sadie sink and stranger things,and i love her too also stranger things its a big bummer that we r in aurstralia
Súper cool
I love her outfit so much, shes beautiful <3
You guys don’t know how great my day is and how I feel when she didn’t talk about her first date 😂. Look I know my chances are slim but don’t judge me ok it could happen 😭. But Fr  that’s amazing that she’s not all into that stuff and stereotypical romance like most girls. She’s just nice and cool and down to earth. Oh and perfect yeah she’s perfect idk if I said that yet 😂 lol
i love her and want to see more
This many people love the stranger things cast 👇
Sadie sink 🤗🤗🥰🥰 max
Wowww! They get made to do so much press in one day! I've just watched Sadie in the same outfit in 4 different interviews
I love this but I have a commentary, the Michael Myers costume is actually not the first scene, her first scene (I think) is when Max arrives to the classroom
I love mint chocolate chip omg
May God bless you and your family and help you Give your life to Jesus Christ and repent. I pray that God will lead on the path to Jesus Christ and send the Holy Spirit to be your helper. I pray this in the mighty name of Jesus Christ I pray Amen! Jesus Christ loves you. Give your life to Jesus Christ and ask for forgiveness for ALL OF YOUR SINS. Even the ones committed in the past and repent. He’s coming soon. Please pray and repent.
she is my wife
she’s the one fr
It so funny that they thought that she was to "old"but then she was the same height and age🤣🤣😂
i swear if max is not alive in season 5 i will cry man
how is she 20?
How you make yourself cry
I have always wanted to be on tv
I can’t believe Sadie sink did this 3w ago
Sadie is such a good person  I wish I could hang with her
i love the way she carrie’s her self
She reminds me of young Sabrina carpenter so much
I do the same i eat cereal for dinner sometimes .
That was Millie not Sadie
Les go sadiee.
Mint Chocolate Chip is GOAT💯💯👌👌
Sadie smile Tho
Wait, Sadie AT 18 bought HERSELF A TESLA but then sold it because she didn’t use it?!? I’m so jealous. whattt
MCU, hurry and cast her as Jean Grey!
I love u so much girl😭💗
wanted to hear about the first date story unless she was insisting she hasn't been on one... idk her sarcasm is too good
Sadie should be in a movie with composers like Han Zimmer, Michael Giacchino, Danny Elfman, Christopher Young and more.
i luv sadie sm
I love this outfit on her so much. She did a few interviews with it and I’m absolutely in love
Now I obviously know it's fiction but...  Sadie: my first friend on set was Finn in the show: *Mike wants nothing to do with her*
When she was reading that dear billy letter this season it felt so real and sad !!! Like I was actually their or sum
Even though it’s literally illegal for me and her to ever date she my soulmate fr
Im in love with this cute girl 😍
Sadie how was the scene where you almost got killed by vecna???
Its hard to not be obsessed with her. Great personality, talent and just gorgeous
if you’re reading this I pray that you have a good day, and I hope you’re doing better than you were before ✝️❤️
I love how her and maya hawke have the same favorite ice cream flavor
I met Sadie some years ago when Season 2 had just been released, and she has to be one of the loveliest people I’ve ever met. So so genuine, delightful, and down to earth. Love her❤️
I love mint chip ice cream and I did not know that people did said or thought that
I just now realized she's hot. 10 out of 10
I just wanted to say that there’s a lot of similarities in S1 and S4. SPOILERS When El kills the bad people in the middle school, she makes their eyes bleed, similar to Vecna. El also killed the demogorgon the same way she sent one to the upside down. When they revive Will, they play the same song that played when Max died before she came back.
She's so kind and genuine I really want to be friends with her even though I'm 11
we love you mad max
I love 💕 Sadie
Does she know they sell bluebell ice cream in other states too? 😂
Sadie is the most genuine and beautiful girl ever.
Sadie carried season 4 with her superb acting!
مش قولتلك متنزليش من غير الطرحه عشان بغير 😡😡
I've only watched one series and one trilogy with her in it and she became my most favorite actress. I've had favorites before but her presence and sudden existence to the series really turned my world upside-down, in a nice way. She's so interesting, humble, and a breath of fresh air. Sooner, Sadie Sink will be a huge name in the industry, bigger than now.
😍🌟🤗
she looks sooo much younger than she is it is crazy
1k
She’s really talented!
I love mint chocolate chip ice cream!😍
she's such a beautiful soul! i am so happy she had more screentime and a bigger role in season 4! She so deserved it!
Sadie is just so sweet 🤍🤍
Sadie you are truly truly amazing. You have a bright future ahead of you! Always be yourself. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Love your red hair. ❤️😍❤️
Ah, she is a Texan girl for sure. And yes if you ever lived in Texas you'll know how delicious is Blue bell chocolate ice cream!
BEST GIRL
SHES SO CUTE
finn and Sadies friendship is so cute man <3
yay me and Sadie Sink have the same favorite ice creammmmm :0
I love her so much, she's so talented and seems like such a lovely person. 💗
Thats one thing we have in common I like eating cereal😂  So do u
Jesus loves you.
2:49 I feel like Sadie and Hailee Steinfeld are similar when it comes to going out with boys. "Yes, they do, i just don't go" and "No" 🤯
I have always wanted to kiss a redheaded female.
I can listen to her voice all-day 😌
I really like her alot! She seems cool and down to earth.
I can’t point it out but something about her is very likable. She has a particular charm that makes you like her 🧡
she has become one of my fav actresses
my good sis sadie
Rip eye sight  🚫👀
Bruh i thought she was still 14 and they got a different actor 🤣
Sadie is so right about the blue bell ice cream. It is indeed delicious and by far the best ice cream
I love her personality sm! 🥰❤
I love everything-g about Sadie she's just so cute and amazing
Her spirit is overwhelming….
She loves having her hair in her face, so relatable for me <3
She’s such a breath of fresh air, just so genuine, not chaotic. Very mature young actress. I can see her become Hollywood royalty, a future best actress.
I love her character, she needs to be on more shows she is SUCH good actor
In season 1 they were like 13-14 they looked so little compared to teenagers now, thats so weird but so awesome at the same time
She is so cool. Bright future ahead.
Crush🥰
It’s incredible that Sadie who’s 20 is still wanting to look like herself and going with her age. Unlike Millie Bobby who at 18 is already looking to morph with the Kardashian look trend. So sad young people don’t wanna look like themselves anymore… But I hope Sadie doesn’t lose herself in the fame and success wave and stays grounded.
It's crazy how closely in terms of personality she is with max. Max is sadie
Sadie is such a beautiful and talented actress. Her performance in season 4 was awesome! She seems like such a chill and down to earth person. I'm excited to see what other projects she does in the future. 👍👍
She and Max are so different but both so cool! Love her calming energy
it's so hard to believe she is actually 20 yrs old
Watching Sadie Sink's interviews is also realizing that she's just one of the most sweetest girl, you'll vibe with her, and she's not hard to approach except she's a celebrity so we can't really
Was her mom driving as fast as billy😂😂
i love that her and dacre are still friends! they're both so talented and both are so genuine.
2:47 Question: First Date? Sadie: NO
Good job you killed it this season
Your so PRETTY and I LOVE stranger things  And my first favorite character. Is Eleven then Max And also  My family was like if they kill max  I'm done the first time we watched stranger things and your  bones starts to crack we all were like omg they better not kill  Max
Wait Atlanta Georgia?
what is the name of the black top she’s wearing
She's a brave and stunning woman.
She’s so pretty and nice. Such a talented young woman
Your first date would of been with Lucas at the dance
At 2:47 I'm confused. Is she saying no to telling them abt her first date, or that she hasn't had one. Like, I'm so confused abt that one part and it's rlly bugging me😅
I feel like her character gained so much depth this season. She is great.
She gives great advice
I didnt even realize she was in The Americans. Elite level TV. especially for cable tv
I love her sm.
Imagine going to school with Sadie 😭
Keep running Max!!
shes so cool 😭 i love her
Sadie Sink is pretty, now she's all woman
i love her sm
I love her
man Sadie is cute
Such a good actress and she did so much of emotional lifting for season 4 of Stranger Things. Sadie and Caleb are more than deserving of awards for their performances. She was also fantastic in Fear Street 1978.
she is definitely the best in season 4
she's already living by herself? wonder how many of the others are also
I love your Hair
Blue bell mint chocolate chip ice cream!!! Yes
i loveee mint chocolate chip 🤭.
The creators thought she would’ve been too old, but she’s the only one who looks young enough now. Mike looks like a full grown man.
I’m 14 and I want to go on American idol next year but seeing stranger things and how they have created great friendships and all the things makes me want to pick up acting. I think I’d be too nervous though and afraid of messing up and stuff but I don’t know. I’m really into animals and music (and really not into sports lol) but I don’t know I might get into acting, I just don’t know where to start.
click bait asf
Honestly!! This season belonged to Max!!!she  is my favorite!!
how not to love?😍😍👉🏾❤️👈🏾
I’m so happy she’s getting the recognition she deserves. The most genuine and talented actress to me! Loved her in st, fear street and all too well❤️
If max dies I’m literally gonna file charges against the duffer brothers lmao. Sadie is now my favorite actress and if I had to choose, I think max is my favorite character on stranger things. Sadie seems like such a sweet, down to earth girl and very mature. She’s definitely my celebrity crush now. I’d give anything to meet her
She played Annie on Broadway? The pinnacle!
Sadie sink is the most adorable human being in earth..🥺🥺🥺🥰
Yes a mint chocolate chip fan🤘😤
I finished the whole show in 4 days...
She's so poised and down to earth. She seems like such a sweet person. Her acting is absolutely incredible. I actually was brought here by an article talking about how she played Annie in Broadway. The videos are precious!! Her acting was amazing then as well.
Lol season 1 in 2 days... I did season 1 in 1 day then 2 and 3 in 1 night then season 4 the next day... 3 DAYS
0:50 the way she said that 😭✋✋
I like Max as a character, but the more I see of Sadie herself in Interviews, it's hard not to get a little crush on her.
She’s so pretty for what ❤
I. Love. Her.
yes Sadie mint chocolate chip hard slayyyys
She soo beautiful . The first date one got me cracking up
I think Sadie’s career will be something like Zendaya’s, because even though they’re young adults, they could still play roles as teenagers because they both still look like teenagers lol. I do hope to see Max recover, either way I look forward to seeing Sadie’s future 😄
I hope they’ll confirm the cast of The Selection series coz she’s perfect as America Singer and I love to see her act as a princess 👸 💕🥲
i love her so much.. she really is like a breath of fresh air. she's so lovely and inspiring <3
Max your like my MOST FAV STRANGER THINGS character !! I really wanna meat you irl it would be my dream come true and I litterly cried when I saw that Max maybe wouldn't make it to season 5 😭
Such good questions, in my opinion
SADIE IS PERFECT
I LOVE SADIE
the word "like" count is 96 times
She's so pretty it's insane.
Mad max is like everyone's little homie! Can't wait to see her back in season 5
she’s amazing & such an inspiration i love her
I LOVE SADIE'S OUTFIT IT'S SO PRETTYYYY
she’s adorable
I have always loved her as Max but I think she truly outshined everyone in season 4.
Stranger Things is DEFINITELY getting to the beginning of the end. 😉
Running up that hill
i love her alot she's so pretty and so sweet
What is the black bralette thing she is wearing? What brand?
Sadie seems like such a sweet genuine person! She’s also so pretty and a great actress who carried Stranger Things 4
Love her!!!❤️❤️❤️
She gives me drew Barrymore energy a little bit. She’s a great actress. Can’t wait to see what she does
"Do I look like a little girl?. AAa"
Such a cool kid. She reminds me of Drew Barrymore.
I LOVE SADIE
sadie's smile is everything. i love her.
she seemed so nervous when doing interviews for her first season. but now shes thriving doing media. gotta love it.
0:43
⭐️Sadie⭐️⭐️OMG⭐️
She is so pretty
Bro how is she so perfect
Hopefully Max comes back for Season 5!! Max is one of my favorite characters!! Way to go Sadie!!
i love her so much, she's always so smiley and seems very kind and fun to be around, a true gem♥
Her personality is so like beautiful
I LOVE HER BEST ACTOR ON ST FR
it's nice watch this kind of video, some people forget that they're human beings you know, we all are human beings, this bring they more close as person that's why I like.
MY BAB, MY WORLD, MY WIFE, MY DAUGHTER, MY EVERYTHINGGG U BETTER BE ALIVE !!!! :((
I love Sadie sink so much and was sobbing for max in volume 2
I could be her first and only husband too 👀
bruh i love acting, this gives me sm hope to maybe actually start a career in acting..  i just want so many things, i wanna be so many things.. i love dancing i love bei g creative in all types of ways... expressing art through painting and drawing, music videography and just ughhhh  sucks to be be here right now
Honestly she absolutely killed it this season. In Seasons 2 and 3, I didn’t really care for Max as a character, but in this season, she managed to become one of my favorite characters.
Sadie is only a year older than me, how peculiar! I can see why people would think she's younger than she is, I know people get it wrong with me.
She definitely killed it this season
sadie is a really great actor
SHE ALSO LOVES MINT CHOCO HELP—
I was here :)
0:48 real
Yea she look so young, she look 17
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. 👍🏽
trust me gaten looks no diferrent that in S1-S4
Is it just me or does she resemble Drew Barrymore?
Okay, I'm officially a new Sadie Sink fan! Pls give her aready her own Netflix series!
I love her 🥺
She’s so dope
Tbh I think Billie a racist bc he really hates Lucas for no reason and not mike or Dustin
Q: first date? Sadie: no
as a texan, i agree. bluebell is our best quality
the way she laughed at “billy punches me across the face”😭
omg she's totally my girl!!!! mint chocolate chip supremacy
god im sooo in love with her. the only thing keeping me going is the hope that there's a multiverse and in one of them we're atleast friends 😭
Sadie , I know you are reading this comment.... I just wanna tell you that you have nailed in this season.  Loved it ❤️ keep growing
I just want to know if she's sick of running up that hill yet
Sadie is such an inspiring actress! The main reason why I love Sadie is that she’s so real and down to earth and is beautiful!
My favorite in also mint chocolate chip!!!
SEASON 4 she was a major player
She mentioned blue bell ice cream…and that is when i realized she is a fellow Texan 🫶🏽
1:10 yo almost sounds wrong
And now shes my fave in the show
She gives me Zendaya vibes.
Imagine it taking you 2 days to watch season 1 🙄💅 WEAK GURL
She looks 16 but she's 20 like wtf
Don’t have a clue what this about and haven’t watched it lol. Just saw 999k views clicked it and turned to a million😀 OCD perfecto
They all look so old
holy moly she was on The Americans??
Love Sadie Sink
My favorite character. Literally cried so hard for her in the last episode 💔
fadie nation WE RISE
Smoke weed
good good
Sadie sink those teeth into ....
Why did you have to die
first bed time?
i see her in future Marvel's movie
Sadie sink inspires me so much, I want to be an actor, too!!
The way it slipped into my hand 😛😛😛
I have grown to love Sadie so so much over her time on ST. Her as an actress and her character too ofc!
in love with this girl omg
Sadie so cool
max canót to die, thasks for your great job
the way she talked about finn gives me life
She is a ray of sunshine and pretty radiant i couldn’t love her more🤍🤍
Love her!
I love u Sadie
The most amazing thing about Stranger Things is how all of the child actors turned out to be normal and grounded individuals, seemingly able to avoid the Hollywood child star trap. Kudos to everyone.
Helloo
I love how she was considered too old but she’s literally the only one who looks her age season 4💀
She’s amazing she’s gonna be successful
she's so articulate and such a sweetheart. she deserves so many awards for her acting!!!
You would love this
5:00 gaten tho ;)
Im officially in love...❤
She has a beautiful voice❤!!!
I loved "the Americans" did not realize Sadie was in it
Hmm
Hey guys! Does anyone know what song is playing at 5:48 ? That flute tune in the background. Sounds familiar but can't place it
I want her to play Jean Grey in the MCU
i hope she has a long and marvellous career.
i love her😭😭😭
She's so loveable and pretty. How can you NOT have a crush on her
guys is it just me or i feel like sadie is like the main character in season 4 lol
Don’t die
Bless the industry person who told her to go be a kid.
In season two she actually looked a little older/bigger^  than the other kids.. I think because usually girls look more older and mature than boys until like 15.. Now in season 4 boys looks older than her haha!! Max is one of my fav characters ❤️
she still looks like 15 and she's 20 dude wtf
Sadie es muy hermosa.
She’s fine
Amazing
I MAKE A DEAL WITH GOD
#sadisit group! <3
Love you sadie
Sadiiie
her performance in season 4 was everything. this kid is def going places.
she's so pure and wellspoken omg such a role model
Wait was Eleven trying to hold Max back?
Yo Is She The Same Actor As For FearStreet Part 2 And Part 3 ??!
she deserves an emmy honestly
SHES MY FAV CHARACTER AAAA.
2:46 lol same🥲
Her voice>>>
MINT IS SO GOOD SADIE!!! AND IM IN TEXAS
Sadie Sink hope we meet one day no cap
I love the attention Sadie is getting after her outstanding performance this season! She CARRIED season 4!! Amazing amazing performance
It was so nice to hear Sadie without Millie interrupting her 😂
Oh my God her favorite ice cream flavor is mint chocolate chip I thought I was the only one
omg she’s so pretty- ✋💖😍
She is going places she is an amazing actress,and I also love mint chocolate chip
She great
ugh i'm obsessed with her, she's so incredible
Sadie sink is the perfect person to portray Max.
I'm almost 50, and last year I finally started to do stuff I always wanted to do, and early this year I put myself out there for real, for the first time in my life, and, I ended up with a permanent position at the company I always wanted to have a permanent position at. So happy. Yesterday the position was finalized. I'm one of the "family" now, so happy. I'm glad Sadie knew that doing that is key, way earlier in life. I found out after my brother passed away last year. (Way too early).
she is literally the coolest person ever
Sadie’s smile is sooo contagious:)
The new season 4 2 episodes came out on July 1st and that is my birthday and this is my absolute favorite seasonal show ever and  would die to see everyone in the entire cast! 😁🥰😘😘
Coma
Does Sadie Sink know Tony Hawk, since she collects skateboards? Because I used to play “TH: Proskater 4” and it was a fun game on Playstation 2 when I was 9yo. Many tricks I enjoyed, and some “Owies” I laughed at so much. 😂 Good times.
she's adorable
1:28 Wow didn't know this scene was the first scene she shooting 😅
finn looks so good in 5:53
Sadie Is so awesome and kinda down to earth person and real !!!
Yes I live in Texas and blue bell icecream is soooooo good my fav one is cookies and cream
She don’t look 20
ginger snaps
My name is Taylor love your YouTube video s 🎊🎊😍🎊🎊🍒🍒🍒🍉🍉
Repent bc Jesus is coming back soon but u don’t got too
Stranger Things I am obsessed with you you are literally my favorite show that I love to watch
girl no. this is too much. why are youtube recommendations so cruel.
Laoal
i am so sad, volume two is just so sad
Shes such a phenomenal person
She’s in a coma she was dead for a minute but came back maybe there’s hope or I’m just saying that to myself to not be sad
how do you even sign up or get an audition for big shows like stranger things?
Who else looked up tons of videos about Sadie Sink of the Finale of s4???
She was for me the star of season 4. she is am amazing actress and I hope that she‘ll be on much more great projects.
Your my favorite stranger things character!!!
just finished vol.2 and need to make sure that she's ok
Where can I find the whole interview?
Teen?? Isn’t Sadie not like 20
O
Sadie is one of the best Actresses ever
max died then eleven used her powers to get her back
Sadie’s the type of person i want to be best friends with til my deathbed. She’s amazing
Rip
I love Sadie! She's so outgoing and just overall seems like a genuinely nice person. That would be awesome to meet her.
I love Sadie so much in stranger things but her acting in the all too well music video is what gave me life!!!
Sadies seems to be a very down to earth, cool young woman. I'm very amazed by her acting and singing!
The fact that two people now have worn the michael myers mask in st now

Daily Reminder: You worth living! Jesus loves you and so do i!
Crazy how she and the brother where the only one who knew
I just finished season 4 pt2. I’m a sad
VECNA IS MIND FLAYER MAX DIES AND EDDIE DIES
Why did u have to die😭😭😭😭
Uhhh hey Max what's up 🥲 I already Miss you
She is my idol 🤩
i can't believe sadie's 20 omg
Everyone's on here talking about how "she's going places." Uh, no, you're wrong. The young lady is 20 years old. She's not "going" places she's already HERE!  Give her credit where it's due. She's amazing.
Why is she purposely deepening her voice ??? She stops and you can hear her natural voice . Then she purposely deepens it ?
She’s so cute
SHE IS 20?!?!! SHE LOOKSS 18 OR 19BUT 20 THE F
interesting videos , cool moments
She's super sweet and genuine. I hope she stays down to earth. ❤
App
They could not have chose more perfect people to play the characters
She is such a beautiful, talented and, passionate actress. She definitely deserves everything coming her way. Watching her on Stranger Things has been a great delight and I am very excited to see what the future holds for her. Keep going Sadie!!
She was afraid for joining the show with a enormous fandom, and she ended up being loved and the favorite character of many. I love her so much 🫶🏻
She's seems so nice and she looks so gorgeous just truly nice girl
I wanna be an actor but i don't know where to start it looks so fun and hard at the same time and i don't have the money to fly to different countries and my parents probebly won't like the idea
if i had her voice i would never shut up 😭
AHHH SHES SO PHENOMENAL<3
"I watched it in like 2 days"  Amateur numbers
I can’t believe she’s already 18
wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in his word my whole being waits. - Psalm 130:5
Mint chocolate chip is my top time favourite ice cream for 10 years.
I remember being annoyed there was a new character in season 2. "Who's this new girl", and now she's my favourite character.
Stranger things is full of child clones..hence Millie bobby Brown is Natalie Portman. Everything it talks about in this interview is agenda driven
got more madwheeler content in a nine minute teen vogue interview than in a nine hour season of stranger things so thanks teen vogue
She’s the best

Ha ha so funny
Ha ha so funny
YESSS I AM WITH SADIE ON THE  BLUE BELL ICECREAM!!
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross for wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is about to pass away ✝️ the gates of grace are open for a short time.
I geniunally love her, way too much…
Sadie is honestly one of my favorite actresses ever!! She's so sweet and inspiring and I love everything about her :)
she so well-spoken and has such a great personality. fav actress <3
Mint chocolate chip has always been my favorite ice cream too. I don't understand why more people don't like it honestly.
First to say, she’s so beautiful
She always seemed pretty nice, but cereal for supper? She's a keeper.
Sadie:” i think i watched season 1 in like 2 days”  Me who watched all 4 seasons in 4 days:👽
she seems so sweet what a queen
I really love her personality , light hearted and humble 👏🏼
“Don’t recommend channel” wack AF
the rainbow on the first date thing sadie you fruity?🤨
1:04 is actually so accurate how she said it, watching season 4 the cast was around my age now and somehow I still think they’re that age even though I was around priahs age when season 3 actually came out 😭
She is carrying this season. She has to win something.
How is she so beautiful 😍😍
she doesn't look like her age at all
B
OMG Yes blue bell ice cream raised me, best ice cream ever.
The people involved in The Maxwell case have been intentionally blocking the release of the names of abusers.
Sadie is a great young actress
What an actress! Am a big fan fram Turkey.
She’s the sweetest person
I thought Sadie was Vegan but then she talked about Mint Coch Chip Blue Bell ice cream... which isn't Vegan 🤔
Just gonna say it now I’ve been crushing on her before it was popular (last year)
sounds like Dove Cameron
Tranvestite
❤️😘
HER SMILE IS EVERYTHINGGGG
First date??? Bruh
For her age she is so mature and composed ♥
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
I love stranger things I watched season 1 not 2 and 3 I watch it with my parents
Omg! She's 20! I sure knew she wasn't 14 like the character but I still thought she was younger than 20! XD
Her personality in stranger things it’s the total opposite.
I LOOOOOOVEEEE SADIEEE OMGGGGG❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love Sadie!!
her smile is so pretty she's so pretty
ily sadieee
she bought a tesla for herself as a gift then sell it because she's not using it😭 this is why i love you sadie.

BLUE BELL IS THE BEST ICE CREAM
Sadie is always the best in stranger things glad max escaped vecna but i don't want to see max dying 😭
❤
My dream is to meet her I hope I can go to the season 5 premiere or something because she’s like my idol!
Sadie is such an intellect!!!!! And really really super talented! I fell in love with her the moment she appeared on ST season 2, i was like, she's gonna be my fave!!!!! For sure

DRAWING STRANGER THINGS CHARACTERS... | IT'S HERE ON THE CHANNEL !!!!!!!
SADIE! Love her. She is a gem
2:47 Was that super fruity or is it just me?
im in love with sadie
8:45 'I turned 18 over the pandemic" Those are some of the hottest words you'll hear for the 5-7 years. I feel like the boss just gave me the "go-ahead." "Ya 18 yet, Mehg? GIggity. Awwwllllright!
pls follow timmy because he’ll buy me a new iphone once he hits 2k https://twitch.tv/timmythetechguy
She is really pretty
i love her so much, such a nice actress.
I-City: https://youtu.be/hsVYjpeygNg
she could be a good jean grey if they do an x-men movie...
Hi girl that almost died
She’s so down to earth i love her so much for being that way ❤
Who else noticed that the notebook sticker next to each question is Olivia Rodrigo's sour composition book?
I'm have weached all of the seasons and episodes in all of seasons 4 and seasons 5 is July 1 me 9 and My name is Jackie
Love her soooo much i'm looking forward to more of her projects after ST. I especially want to hear her sing more
she’s so real
Sadie is a great actress, and it's very nice that her first friend on the set was Finn😀
I love her so bad
She’s like a younger Dakota Johnson. God I love her!!
Beautiful!
AAAHHH they put the scary pic of her as the thumbnail 🤣 lol Sadie is so sweet
first date? Sadie: NOP
omg she's PERFECT for America! her looks, her voice and her smile.. NETFLIX PUT A CROWN ON THAT RED HAIR
I always thought she was English
https://youtu.be/CD4EC9JpdyU………….
Sorry to say this but this was really boring
i just love her so much
sadie is talented & beautiful.❤
Sadie is literally the most beautiful person ✨
Stranger things for sure catapulted her into the premier league. She is going to be a massive superstar!
Thankyou for showing us this sending prayers to you and your family and everyone GOD bless you and your family and everyone.
her outfit. so true bestie.
She’s a cereal for dinner kinda girl? She says this as I’m currently eating fruity pebbles for dinner...
Millie should be threatened. Sadie will be bigger than her outside of Stranger Things and she is more likeable.
WAit IM 7 HOURS EARLY-
Unpopular opinion, but I feel like Sadie is a much better actress then Millie. She's got such a better range of expressing her emotions and with Millie it's the same old, same old.
I love so much her
i love mint choc chip
I played annie to i played mr warbucks
Mint chocolate chip is good
Sadie is so beautiful and charming. She would be phenomenal in a RomCom! Cant wait!
give her an Emmy immediately!!! Episode 4 had me ugly crying
Cultured person with mint choc chip being her favourite ice cream flavour
Sadie is so sweet and kind. Love her!
TE AMO MUCHO SADIE 💘🌷💌💞
6:15 she is so right though. Mint choc chip>>>>you
i could listen to her talk all day
“Things people get wrong about me is my age, apparently I haven’t aged and they have” it’s sad that a lot of people still looks at them like they are 12 or 14 when they aren’t. They are growing up guys
i love her sm
Funny how Finn was her first friend on set, but since they first met in the show mike hated her😂 how ironic
she doesn't like eye contact I can tell
omg i love her i want to be her friend so bad she seems so nice. i also lover her fit ❤️
is normal that i really want sadie as my friend?:,)
Mint chocolate chip is like the best ice cream ever!
We love Sadie
I love her outfits bro hhhhhhh
ily sadie 💕
Okay is’t weird that i want her to join mcu ? She’s so talented and sweet
So proud of her. God Bless her on her journey of acting! #TeamMadMax
I may not have always been a Max fan but Season 4 totally turned that around for me. She was phenomenal this season! Sadie’s performance was Emmy worthy
she’s perfect
shes so well spoken
and she loves mint chocolate chip? i love her even more
She will go far in the acting world. She deserves an award for her performance
she’s genuinely such a sweet person i love her
Tão maravilhosa 💓love you Sadie
She seems so sweet🥺
it's really ironic that Finn was her first friend on set since, as y'all prolly know in the show Mike he was the last one to want Max in the party.
aaawwww sadie and i habe the same tastes in ice cream mostly on mint chocolate things like that ig?
she is prettier than whats her name Millie.
Imagine being the guy who dated Sadie and leaving her, and a few years later seeing she’s super famous😭
She is so sweet 💗💗💗
i love her
God it’s so weird watching Sadie Sink interviews because she reminds me exactly of a good friend of mine they have the exact same mannerisms and way of speaking with their voice. It’s kind of hard to explain but it’s almost uncanny lol.
literally slay
MAD MAX!
Omg she dis great😀
🤍
I love this girl. Could listen to her the whole day.
Max is my favorite stranger things character, and Sadie seems so awesome!
She just instantly made friends yknow like with the cast of stranger things-, they just bundled together and learning more about Sadie, it’s so fun I love how nice she is, always be yourself Sadie! :D
She has never been on a date??? With that beauty?? God she's such a gem
She is so inspirational I genuinely feel loved by her and as if I can do anything! 💕
I love her
She is really talented, I love her 🙂
*I love Sadie Sink. She seems like she would be an awesome person to have as a best friend and/or an even better girlfriend. She seems beautiful inside and out and has the perfect smile too. I wish I could find a girl like her.* 🤞
Love mint chocolate ice cream too and always feel the same way about it, no one else likes it and thinks it tastes like toothpaste. Absolutely does not. It’s the best
Me and Sadie have the same… trate, aging wise😂. I get that most of the time, people don’t believe me when tell them my real age. For example, 3 years ago I was at a concert and I went to get some beer, and they asked my id, I was 30 back then… So Sadie, I get you 🤗🤗
future oscar nominee right here
She’s going places for sure! I can see her getting an Emmy or Oscar one day! Perhaps even being one the it girls for gen z
2:47
She needs a podcast ASAP i could listen to her talk forever
Can we appreciate how pretty her red hair is?
It’s cool to learn about this I think Sadie deserves to win a Oscar
Her voice is so smooth and sweet ^^
