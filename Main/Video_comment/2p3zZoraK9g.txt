Lush song but most tacky music video ever! Does anyone other than bonobos actually like twerking anyway? And when she does the splits all the time she looks like a bored and over-pampered cat stretching. The bit where she pretends to read a book while pole dancing is totally tragic! So all in all, love the video :)
spreading that yeast around to feed the Mushrooms
I just love SZA music 🎶 so therapeutic ✨✨✨🌹
Sad Twerking :')
Lovely 🌹 sweet international RnB and Hip Hop music video
Sanggggg Tyler🔥🔥🔥🔥🎵🎤
Here on my wifeys bday in honor of her❤
Happy Birthday Sza 🍾🎉💕
Y love you❤
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of YAHUAH 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 abides forever.   1 Yahuchanan Ryshun Chapter 2 Verse 15,16,17
This song is on another level… the video lost the essence of the song.

First time I heard this was the genre-bending(?) Chvrches cover from the other side of the world on Triple J. Thought Lauren Mayberry was too high for a guy to karaoke the song, had no idea Kendrick's was roughly the same tone, lordy. Heck of a song

Been having more rough days than I’d like to admit. I throw this on when my mind feels heavy sometimes...idk there's something about it, makes me reach for my journal and just let it out. Better days are coming, and they’re worth writing toward
Miss her

I am not quite sure why SZA is thirst trapping these days... I miss the old SZA the cute comfortable in her skin with great raps SZA, but then again I wonder was she really comfy... F this industry, life and the nonsense expectations that are placed on beautiful people. Aside from that keep shining SZA

The most tantalizing voice in entertainment at this point in world history. And her dancing is a sublime manifestation of her poetic essence.
One of them days ❤️
there's a young mechanic (chrisfix) with more followers than sza lolololo wow, that kid passed the 10M mark. good for him, and I may have just generated even more subs ;).. you're not too far back sza. good for you too.   On a different note: I wanted to share this song with my 13yr old daughter but I saw the video and I thought, maybe not.

Bucket list... stop the car, get out, blast some tunes and just dance.... SZA makin me wanna live out loud
The meaning of LoL is (Lucifer Our Lord) and youre faking it toll you make it atleast acknowledge this ...
I dont need to speak to the iLLuminati with justice what do you think??? 😂
Our final destination i was told was going to be inside of the (Dreamland).... 🥈
I saw the satellite of the transformer (The cars) and it was CLiterus and made of sin 🥈....
Sharingan is my favorite, and I was shown that if my middle finger were to be put inside of the side of the Lord he will have hands around his loins and be able to divide the dimension of the finger nails... To get to places as I was shown 🥈...
Except that it has been fused with my life and the last person to see the blood of the Lord was an Hindu dude I suspect...
I too have the blood of the Lord that doesn't expire or w/e you call it...
Don't ever forget that all of you in the iLLuminati are Israelites, because that is the most damage Lucifer can find...
This video is stupid.

Yes SZA you was right I'm Jesus and yes I know that you are gifted ,
Te amo SZA
Way to kill the moooooood
Pre BBL man her body was goals😭🥲
What is that it was just wondering how to work
I didn't fully understand this video sober but watched it on shrooms one day and my flabber was gasted! The whole song is a symbol of death and rebirth, a transformation of who she is desperately fighting to become..her looking dead at the beginning beside the plate of shrooms symbolizes shrooms helped her discover the things she needed to shed about herself to grow. It's a song about grieving the old, insecure her that was holding her back from evolving into who she is meant to be.
I like a shortened version of "Shirt" being the outro. It makes for a nice beat switch up, but Shirt alone is still an amazing track
In December 2024😢
And suddenly its december!
she's toxic, big fun
I LOV3 SZA BRO SHE GETS US LITTERY 😂😮😊😊😊🎉❤❤❤
*CLAIM YOUR SPOT BEFORE 2024 ENDS* 👇
Love everything about this video. When I got out of my depression this song started playing and i smiled so wide and teared up so much. I felt alive again. The visuals, choreography, just everything about it describes the soul too well, I’m honestly just so hooked and love it.
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out?

'Got me a war in my mind' and oh gawd, the rest of the lyrics. I've just discovered this song. SZA is knot even known in my country. Now this song is in 'mode repeat: ON' in my earplugs. I will come back to this song whenever I need help with my fuc**** anxiety and me mom's grief. Thanks SZA❤

The way she lifts her leg up 1:57
November 2024?
♥️😭
From a skeptical perspective, SZA's music has a few potential downsides:  1. **Focus on Insecurities and Relationship Issues**: Her themes often dwell on self-doubt and troubled relationships, which could lead listeners to fixate on their own insecurities.    2. **Reinforcement of Negative Emotions**: The melancholic tone of her music might cause some listeners to stay in a low-energy, emotional state.  3. **Romanticization of Toxic Behavior**: Certain songs touch on toxic dynamics, which could be seen as normalizing or even glamorizing unhealthy relationships.  4. **Overemphasis on Personal Dramas**: The focus on inner conflict could lead some to feel trapped in personal issues rather than encouraging personal growth.  5. **Repetitive Themes**: Constant focus on heartbreak and doubt may feel limited or uninspiring to some.   These elements may impact listeners differently, depending on individual perspectives and needs.

November 2024
I’ve been listening to this masterpiece when my family moved to countryside for months because of the civil war in our country ,I can’t really do anything no internet no electricity just SZA’ sos playlist on my phone .There is a stream  across the village whenever I feel sad or depressed I always went there and listened to SZA,Good Days is one of my favorites .Since we back home a couple months ago ,every time I listen to SZA especially Good days I feel nostalgic and sad at the same time.I love you so much SZA❤

Fantastic song, another Grammy. However, in terms of RNB could have been kept some of the explicit imagery out of video. May be that's where we are now in 2024.

i loved SZAS first two albums she made so far
numa viagem de cogumelos intensa no clipe kkkkk só na psilocibina
1:15  she was having her moment🤣🤣
This Dani girl hits a 17 yo boy while on his moped and while driving drunk. He had a fractured spine and she only got 5 years probation.  This is so unjust. While he’s probably going to have longterm injuries and she only gets 5 years and $1k fee.
This song is a masterpiece. I love this ❤
August 29 2024 anybody
but sza If ur here i want u too look at tis comment again amidle!!❤😇
AND IT WAS RANING ON MY PARTY IM SO FUCKING MAD LIKE BRO WHAT THE FUCK😭😭
how Is It Good days like i literally have toooo much FUCKING BAD DAYS😭😭
Very sorry
Wait a minute, SZA?(are you ''Solana" Zuid African,...clearly those aren't her initials)? Quite smart ey, if she has their roots. Those dried pieces of things on the book she wrote, depicts traditional bones and she's in the garden too, that's where it starts to take it's course...oh myyyyy...she has an ancestral call...mmmmmmh good for her😊   ''my opinion is worthless in my opinion...''
I thought she was in dream core😭😭

I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me at war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear, if you let me Feeling like (on your own) Feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby Heavy on my empty mind shit I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me at war in my mind (my mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind) Good days (good days on my mind) Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
It's giving Melanie Martinez
Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Good Days                   SZA           Dia bom em minha mente, é seguro dar um passo pra fora Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Pegar um pouco de ar agora, tirar o peso das costas Get some air now, let your edge out Muito cedo, eu falei, você está na minha mente o tempo inteiro Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Você pode dar o fora? Can you get the heck out? Eu preciso descansar agora, me deixou chateada I need rest now, got me bummed out Você é tão, você é tão, você, amor, amor, amor You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe Tenho estado nessa coisa de mente vazia I've been on my empty mind shit  Eu tento não perder o resto de mim I try to keep from losin' the rest of me Eu me preocupo em ter perdido o melhor de mim com você, amor I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby Você não liga You don't care Disse: Não estou tentando ser um incômodo, isso é urgente Said: Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent Tentando entender essas pontas soltas Tryna make sense of loose change Tenho uma guerra em minha mente Got me a war in my mind Tenho que deixar o peso ir, não posso manter o que está me segurando Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Escolho assistir Choose to watch Enquanto o mundo desmorona na minha frente While the world break up in front of me  Enquanto isso, esperarei meu blindado destino com um sorriso no rosto All the while, I await my armored fate with a smile Ainda quero tentar, ainda acredito em dias bons (dias bons) Still wanna try, still believe in good days (good days) Sempre, sempre, sempre dentro Always, always, always inside Um dia bom vivendo em minha mente Good day living in my mind  Me diga que não sou meus medos, minhas limitações Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations Vou desaparecer se você me deixar I disappear if you let me Me sentindo, sim (uau), me sentindo como Jericó Feeling like, yeah (woah), feeling like Jericho Me sentindo como Jó quando ele perdeu a cabeça Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Tenho que me segurar, minha cruz para carregar sozinha, eu Gotta hold my own, my cross to bare alone, I Ooh, curti e vazei, que maneira de quebrar o clima Ooh, played and dipped way to kill the mood Sei que você gosta dessa parada, mas não consigo curtir isso querido Know you like that shit, can't groove it, babe Amor, estou focada nessa parada de ficar com a mente vazia Baby, heavy on my empty mind shit  Eu tento não perder o resto de mim (resto de mim) I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (rest of me) Eu me preocupo em ter perdido o melhor de mim com você, amor Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby Você não liga You don't care Disse: Não estou tentando ser um incômodo, isso é urgente (urgente) Said: Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent (urgent) Tentando entender essas pontas soltas Tryna make sense of loose change Tenho uma guerra em minha mente (minha mente) Got me a war in my mind (my mind) Tenho que deixar o peso ir, não posso manter o que está me segurando Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Escolho assistir Choose to watch Enquanto o mundo desmorona na minha frente While the world break up in front of me  Enquanto isso, esperarei meu blindado destino com um sorriso no rosto All the while, I await my armored fate with a smile Ainda quero tentar, ainda acredito em dias bons (dias bons) Still wanna try, still believe in good days (good days) Sempre, sempre, sempre ensolarada por dentro Always, always, always sunny inside Um dia bom vivendo em minha mente Good day living in my mind  Tenho que acertar, tento libertar minha mente antes do fim do mundo Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world Não sinto falta de nenhum ex, não sinto falta de nenhuma mensagem I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text Eu escolho não responder I choose not to respond Eu não me arrependo, apenas finjo que nada aconteceu I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Metade de nós desperdiçando a nossa juventude, está no presente Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present (Na-na, na-na-, na-na) (Na-na, na-na-, na-na) Metade de nós perseguindo as fontes da juventude e isso está no presente agora Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Just wow sza. This hits different.
“I try to keep from losin' the rest of me. I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe. You don't care.”  Those few lines keep me from going over the edge.

SZA finds the most unusual place to pole dance like in a library and the gas station

Hi Sza, I am one of your biggest fans. I am 12 years old. My favourite songs of yours are F2F, Nobody Gets Me and Drew Barrymore. I missed out on your Sydney tickets but might get merch! I love you so much, I listen to you everyday. Pretty please reply and my life will be complete. I love you SO SO much.  Xx Teyha
This song will  never get old doesn’t matter what time of year it is doesn’t matter what time of day it is. This song will live through all of us.❤
This song is so good, but to avoid any mischief I'd love to see a remake on the sentence, "..before the end of the world". I don't know into what but, SZA is a dope artist so she can't end even if she does other art or not.
SOLANA EU TE AMO
This woman is amazing.
Sza's videos to her songsssss is soo beautiful
Ethereal .. <3

She looks passionate….I can’t feel it though?  I accept that this what it was meant for the #target.  The music is nice.
❤from The Bahamas 🇧🇸
This have been of my songs to calm myself from my anxiety disorder. And i don't know but here, let me tell you, maybe it's the sound of the birds in the song... but a couple of pidgeons came to my window and maybe they heard the song... or maybe the nature just heard the help and they  calm me down, thank SZA, and thank you nature.
whos here before 100M ticket...
I'm currently in rehab and this song helps me to get better
Quando escuto esse som, isso me teletransporta para o paraiso, natureza arvores , ervas ( cannabis ) vibe positiva, Sza vc é um acontecimento Love you baby 🔱😻
I just love this womans voice, it soothes me.
Suddenly life is worth living
My dad died in December 2021, and in the days following his departure, I replayed this song over, and over, and over again. I don't know why but it helped keep me somewhat sane while I paced around aimlessly, smoking and watching the rain turn into snow. While SZA executes it so calmly I can't help but pick up on  those passionately angry, yearning, gutwrenching undertones that you often find within grief.   Such a beautiful song.  Rest in peace Dad, this one will always remind me of you.
SZA YOU HAVE SUCH A TALET- I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU    GOOD DAYS
I wish we y’all took the time to listen to the lyrics and find the meaning in it! This is a great meditation song!
This the best
Education
Sometimes I just come back to this video cause I miss pre-BBL SZA.
It's so late when I realize the spots on the mushrooms are moving
Drift me into the stars then let my immortality disperse my consciousness into the universe    This song take my imagination into euphoria.
and that’s on what?
it's such a angelic song my #1 always and forever 😍😍I love SZA❤❤
Wow
Sza my daughter is such a big fan of you she has a book at you with ur songs.

This song always makes me feel better. Sza, you are my idol <3
This song found me when I needed it the most. I'm alive because of it because I didn't wanna be. But hey here I am
I'm just realizing this may be about taking drugs, I may be reaching 🤣🤣🤣
THATS CHRIS BROWN 😮
i love her so much
everytime i hear this song i just get so calm and happy:< i wanna see her live so bad
She’s so much more than music❤ u go girl❤❤
i love you and youre music sza just dont make a song about me unless you love me
ahhh
Why it slow down
I know probably no one will see this but I’m hoping at least one person will…    My ultimate dream is to sing and make music like this. I just posted my version ‘we can’t be friends’ by Ariana on my channel and I would love even just one person to hear it and enjoy it. It would mean the world. Even if I’m never discovered, just singing makes me happier than anything.   If you do see this, please let me know what you think on my channel. Thank you for taking the time to read, I really hope to see you soon🤍
Still inlove with this song
This is top 5 sza songs
You should make more songs
I’m in love with this song
How do you pronounce her name man  I love her voice

She is so pretty
This song talks about mental health and the toxicity that surrounds us daily and how we should face it. I wrote a first verse: It introduces the feeling of seeking fresh air and mental freedom, contrasting with the presence of heavy thoughts and the desire to push them away. 2. Second verse: Expresses the Third verse: Describes the feeling of being in an internal battle to free oneself from emotional weight and find peace, while observing the world around them fall apart. 4. Fourth verse: Portrays the determination to resist fear and limitations, and the desire to free oneself and feel like a winner, despite the difficulties. 5. Fourth verse: Portrays the determination to resist fear and limitations, and the desire to free oneself and feel like a winner, despite the difficulties. 5. Fifth verse: Talks about the desire to find mental serenity before it's too late, and the decision not to hold onto the past or regrets.  The song explores themes of self-acceptance, internal struggle, emotional freedom, and the pursuit of better days, even in the face of life's adversities.

Sza eu te Amooo, queria muito poder ter  ver você. Doi muito sabe que você está no Brasil e eu não poder te verrrr💔💔💔😭
I mean one cannot get enough of SZA
Loving the visual commentary on intelligence and insight of dancers. Genius does occur in the dance world, high level @#$%.
even three years later, this is still one of my fav songs of all time
❤
E muita apelação destas mulheres , só o talento com a voz parece que não querem tem que mostrar o corpo,  sensualisar parece que isto é o principal e o talento fica em segundo plano
Good daysss in my mindddd❤💫☄️

Sorry only heard if her a few weeks ago im confused how she is headling the Pyramid stage are they trying to put everyone asleep.
glad they posted the words
Tedious ramblings.
IMHO   ............Looks like someone wandered on to the set of "Tele-Tubbies" and planted Magic Mushrooms ......  then found the worst kept Library EVER , installed a pole dance 'space' and filmed a music 'vid' ..... i'm sure it's popular with 'da kidz' .   ...Hmmmm
half naked chick to sell a poor song

She directed her own video !! Give this woman her flowers
Sorry.
3:39
hey, anyone know the song at 2:54 ?
Some beings among us are actually divine. SZA is an example! Songs that speak to us through the experiences we have, in addition to moving us and helping us, also make us continue on the journey; Only gods can do that!
Ate this song right tf up🥹
Did not have to eat me up like this🤨
His name is Ed Valencia:)

She is so inspirational
The part at the end of the song was my favorite part
The intro was kinda funny but the song was fire though 😂🔥🔥
What a wonderful song ❤️
🙏🙏🙏
Can I take sza on a date my dime

Beautifuuuul
SZA is up for the best album of the year. Up against Taylor Swift. It's been 25 years since a Black Queen won the album of the year. I wish this Black queen all the best. PS: I don't get it with Taylor Swift. Her music is just not for me.
I could listen to this all day yoooo
I love u queen ❤
I can’t put into words the way I felt hearing this song for the first time.. I felt so many emotions… I couldn’t stop watching the video… had to keep replaying this over and over… I’m holding out for good days ahead too my friend. God bless you.

3:12
One of the greatest 🔥🔥
This song is trash
I'm scared how I barely just found this song & it's literally about my current place in life. 😮😢😂
This video is so cool. Love it
It's been two year's still listening to this masterpiece
This is what R&B sounds like... I'm obsessed
Have to say this song is so addictive and beautiful I can’t stop listening to it. And I’m a heavy screamo kind of guy but I feel like the music video over does it as if it’s more like a trap rap video doesn’t capture the soft touch this song has I dunno don’t at me about it I love sza body just hate that it takes attention away from it
mother
This song makes me cry and I don’t know why 😢
The video so addictive ❤
Jacob just HAD to shoehorn himself into the video, the egotistical prick
I wish SZA were more popular...Her music is a mood. Her voice, her beats...Are so magical
This that smoke a blunt an clean the room music 🔥🔥
you ate queen
YES YES GOOD DAYS 😆❣❣❣❣❣❣❣😜😜😜😘😘🤩🤩😍

Damn just found out Jacob Collier is on this track and also in the video. Never even noticed.
Gorgeous the story about the fan posting SZA you know what, brought me here.
🧚🧚🧚🧚
IMHO she looks better pre-BBL
Tryna make sense of loose change got me in a war with my mind…  i felt that
Sza really released One of the best albums of our generation
I am crying about Sza
I had no idea she could dance like that. Mad strength and skill! She is an absolute knockout. BEAUTIFUL woman!
The song just went up another level after actually seeing this video 🥹 I love you SZA
Reminds of cottage core 😭
Mushrooms saved sza’s spirit and promoted her well-being. I feel like the video is praising mushrooms and nature. Absolutely love it.
This song is sooo good. 😣
"All the while I await my armored fate with a smile" this exact lines drives me crazy😣
It was cool to see her win her Grammy with Doja Cat. She was super humble and well deserved.
Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

Perfect ♡
I listened to this song on repeat about a year ago when I was reading a little life… yeah. I cry everytime I listen to this song. Poor Jude
Sza wrote it first.  Of know body wants you, if know body wants you,  your free!!!❤❤❤ now that's a prize with comes with pain a pain that's true, but rather better with love.  I believe in your love ❤❤❤
Aww c'mon, turn off the pitch correction.  I wanna hear the raw magic.  I sincerely miss the days when sistaz could actually sing, AKA anything before AutoTune was invented.  Nowadays ppl couldn't sing without a computer if their LIFE depended on it ffs.
SZA, you are an extraordinary performer! Please don't ever stop doing what you do. You are truly a wonderful gift to me and the rest of the listening population!!!❤️
I have this CD by SZA I love her music. Her voice is so beautiful 😍
You are truly beutiful FACT !! I MEAN YOU SING LIKE A ANGEL AND DANCE LIKE SOMETHING ELSE 🎶 XX❤
BEST INTRO IN MUSICAL HISTORY OMG
Crazy how she released shirt over a year later 😪

I do believe Travis Scott and Sza sre are soul mates and would make the perfect couple. ❤️
ethereal
To go back to the day i heard this song for the first time 😩🥺 💛🕯
one of the best songs ever.never gets old
Her voice addictive af
Perfect
Você acabou de postar um story com essa msc, não se falamos faz um tempo, falei que ia te conquistar mas ainda não sei como,você demostra as vezes que quer mas dps some, você está na minha mente todo instante, como pode ser possível uma pessoa que nem beijei me causar tantos arrepios?espero não me machucar com essa sua indecisão, eu posso te fazer feliz Mariana, te dedicar as coisas mais clichês que existem.”ainda quero tentar, acredito em dias bons”.espero voltar aqui e falar que finalmente te conquistei.

Hoot Good Days
Just close your eyes for a minute listen to the beginning watch your soul leave your body for just 1 minute forget EVERYTHING n just BE 🥰🙏🏾
Why does everything have to be drug and sex related! I just want to enjoy good music without all that. i shouldve never watched the music vid but i love this song though very underrated sza makes really good and unique music
No talent, Only nuditu saw😂
What a talent
Visuals
An Ambient sort of English Country Garden type of vibe in the background with a dreaded Drum Machine not making an appearance until the very end.  "Have a cup of tea, have a cup of tea....".
Amo demais essa , ouvindo aqui no Brasil ❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Such a beatiful being
Libianca brought me here fan from  🇨🇲
Sza has no idea how much this song has helped me heal through my grieving for these past two years since my babydad passed away❤ I relate to every single lyric. My soul identifies with this song ❤

Absolute perfection. Wow. I can see why Bjork is a fan.
The song op but where did the twerk session play in at 😂😂😂😂 went from expression to sexsession real quick 😂😂😂
I listened to this while on shrooms and now I'm permanently trapped in this song forever

Jesus Christ…Sza on that pole given me p valley vibes… would love to see her on that shit
Lmao even though it's been out for months, hearing shirt just end like that in this music video still gives me PTSD of the anticipation and waiting for it to come out. I can here from hit different and after this video YouTube directly took me to Shirt. God it's good to be alive now lol.
I care 💘
Just think of it, Minneapolis right? omg lol  please, they should be adding MPLs to this tour this Girl is too much!!! "I just f*** cant seriously" her voice, her lyrics the first time I heard her version of Good days, I thought Id never heard anything better, her voice along with the music is seriously so ethereal ....
Baby I wish you didn’t get work done… u were perfect just the way u were 😍😍😍😍
Who’s still here in 2023?
Who’s tell you AI Snapchat to hear this song?
listened to and watched this while in the middle of the worst shroom trip of my life. i was at the end of myself and breaking down at the realizations. and this just put me back together, made me feel strong enough to allow what was happening to continue. and looking back, it looks like sza maybe took some mushrooms too..
I seriously think SZA is one of the most beautiful women ive ever seen 🤷
Good days >> kill bill •
I'm still listening it everyday. It's so soothing 🌿
I love u sza

Estevan picked up the science teacher, how cool, he got the better of both of them when she entered their classroom
Omg! Good days is one of my fave SZA song it gives me shrooms vibes and it feels like this song take you to another dimension. I’m shocked that there are shrooms on her MV! Omgggg 🍄🌈

SZA has to be the most original artist of this time. No one can sound like her or look like her. I'm not into girls, but she has me questioning!!!
Wow she's such a great dancer and off course a great singer too. What can't she do?
I had to listen to the song without the video to really feel it.  I feel it I need some more of those good days myself.
no bc this song is soooooo good like fr on replay everyday
Man those lyrics are genius. Love you SZA. You gotta give a regular dude like me a chance. Industry ngas are  always gonna do you wrong
✨✨✨  beautiful voice, beautiful mind, beautiful natural body.     #goals ✨✨
Just noticed that she teased shirt in thiss she’s so smart for doing thatt
Sza amazing talent, singer, songwriter. And she also fine as hell. OMG this so hypnotic.

This song hits me in a deep place
My bf Alvin loved this song we’d listen to it smoke some maryjane just enjoying each other company. RIP baby
3:20 got me dead Fr 😂😂😂❤
Music is nice visuals hot hot garbage of the generic variety
Awesome
This is one of the most flawless songs.
Holy shit this vid hits different when you're tripping I never noticed all the call outs to shrooms as stupid as that sounds
Imma bump this on my next shroom trip
Damnnnn
getting high to this music video.. i had to stand up and start dancing with her. such a heavenly song and creative video thank you SZA omg ❤️‍🩹
I just think.... .. this is the best song I've ever listened to.. .... .
im not the type to ever comment of music videos but this shit gave me a different feeling the melody is immaculate and the meaning to the song just hits
hits me every damn time. love it so deeply
Who has this on repeat in 2023 because they can't seem to get enough?
1 complete song + half another song, but both on the same track?  Sounds good to me!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
she's literally stunning. call this a stretch but she's literally as pretty as a dryad  edit: she's as stunning as a dryad, angel, and queen, as vocally gifted as a siren, or a mermaid, she's quite literally the whole package.
♥️
Dreamy
Her voice sounds so angelic on this record. I hope she continues to follow this sound because it fits her voice so well. 👍
This girl is legitimately talented. It’s undeniable.
Sa lahat ng kanta ni SZA.........eto talaga yung nagustuhan ko ng sobra........💯❤️
Don't miss no ex

i love SZA no cap  her voice vibe and personality is top tier in my book this all ah real 🥷🏾 need 💪🏿💯💯💯💯💯💯
one of the best songs ive heard in my life
This song got me thinking about him I need see my baby again this weekend
yess girll love your kill bill music video😋
The music is so calming and it gives a beachy vibe to the song, absolutely amazing work
Imagine how beautiful this song would be without the twerking and pole dancing.
mushroom era
04:01 VIBE 🤍🙌🏻
I would like to join that library
She is the music industry
i feel like her pole dancing in the room is her past self dancing for money and studying to get somewhere, her dancing in the grass with the mushrooms is her finding herself and connecting with nature and herself, then her in the silver chain outfit is her now living in glamour but acknowledging her growth. i feel like the last scene is her embracing who she really is, she isn’t fame - she is a dancer, she is white tee and denim shorts and that’s where she comes from
Oh and not using some voice thing like reverbs or auto tune to better her sound. Ok there might be some echoing. But that’s a normal effect in music.
A new artist who can sing? What? And has some range and talent. Wow refreshing girl thanks.
Ahh yes, right where i belong to ease my stress/perfectionist bs 🌊💐🏁
The library poledance really got me
WELL DONE
Why did someone so natural blessed modify herself man
Such a deep song and ms girl is a Yoga warrior!
Of all things should depict herself as being a successful artist why be a stripper? That's so weird.
I came because of Libianca✨💖✨
her voice is like a puzzle and she knows hot to fuck our minds with it !
Cool it's okay up👍👍
I love this song but the video creeps me out
Thank You SZA,cause this song I found my DRIVE and I'm on GO
She is so uniquely beautiful and very talented. Gurlah!
Damn, she should have left her body alone!
My favorite song By Sza is  Good Days  The weekend  Broken clocks  Love Globe
OK is it me or is SZA gonna put a video for every single song on her record this video particular I mean really this song is amazing but the video does not go with the song I don’t see where stripper pole Lucci mama Twerking likes OK it’s redundant. Please do some things more special and please no more murderers.🙄😱
Pretty sure KALI ULCHIS ripped this song off. It’s called give you roses. Speak up people
SZA never fails to make my days "good days" when i listen to her musics......
Smh her body was amazing as it is in this vedio. Flawless
yall should watch this on mushrooms
I want en extended cut of that last minute good god.
smash
Favorite part 5:27 😍😘😏 just standing there looking gorgeous 😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this song came out at the time where my previous relationship ended, which was the hardest breakup I’ve ever had to go through. I’m not exaggerating when I say this song helped me so much. when I wanted to give up and I felt hopeless about the future this song reminded me that there are still good days to come <3  plus the lyrics are hella relatable “feel like I wasted the best of me on you, you don’t care.” but then she goes on to say “I don’t miss no ex I don’t miss no text I choose not to respond” like YEAH.
Fam!!! SZA is way too beautiful!!! Extraordinarily flawless!!!😍🥰😇💗❤❤❤❤ Such an incredible track!!! The way SZA crafts and structures tracks are together is too dope!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Even though a lot of these Singles came out earlier, it sounds even better and more cohesive with the album!!! Beautifully done🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙
Watching this music video instead of responding to my ex’s texts 😁
ẞza
Do artists read comments
This is literally psychedelic music I feel bad for people who watch it sober and have no clue what’s really happening lol

"half of us chasing fountains of youth, and it's in the present"
She honestly has the best voice over ever heard. Every word she sings is felt and she meant that.

She has released her spores and breeds love into my soul.
Two years before SZA dropped her long-anticipated second album, SOS, in December, she showed off her pole-dancing skills in a 2020 Instagram post teasing single "Shirt." (And when lead single "Good Days" arrived in March, she continued her seduction in the outro of the music video.) The LP details the journey of post-lust heartbreak and how to regain one's confidence, from the sneaky affair of "Low" to feeling empty on the punk rock-inspired "F2F."
R&B has always maintained a sensual core, and the women of the genre confidently reminded listeners of that fact throughout 2022.
I got to find more words and add them here recurring. ❤
The mood of my mind listening to this masterpiece is out of the world, everything about this woman is so artistic and beautiful, simply amazing! She is the dream maker ❤
1:54
she is a master at this pole. WOW
My ex would slap SZA when we were together. This is my favorite song from her. Thank for sharing those good days with me. I’m forever grateful for you.
Who was the man in the green TV
Who is the man on the green TV
GD is the worst songs on the album

This girl was a former stripper I guess.
❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣😭😭
4:30
Thank you SZA 🙏🏼✨✨
This song makes me happy
Still one of my favorite songs to listen to while in a trip🍄✨💯
Haha it is hot to be in a libary and read ( so I loved that contrast or perhaps potential symbolism). I also loved the transition to the naturesque landscape.
Ive never seen a more beautiful music video
Idk why this song can't get out of my mind
Good days SZA 🔥🔥🔥
76M
I love SZA especially on that pole. She was really being herself and releasing  and showing it to the world

This song is hypnotizing..it's sounds like Angel's playing the Harp in heaven with her her Angelic voice. Priceless!  ❤️ 😍  This needs to be on a Movie 🎬 Soundtrack
Top tier song, top tier video, top tier artist
This is a beautiful video(my fave in recent memory) and easily my fave track off the album. I will say though I'm on the edge of my seat on what's gonna happen if her dog eats those shrooms off her book. It gonna chill in the library with her?
This song helps me get through so much dumb shit, and yet afterwards(after I listen t this song) I feel good about myself.

I hope she could release this form of shirt like how she did an alt for love galore, I prefer how this version is more mellow
How can a chick name themselves like a member from wu tang ?
She is so talented. What a beautiful voice. This song sounds so sensual. My granddaughter turned me onto this song. Thank you, Kaily and SZA!
So is she praising or what seems spiritual
As a man, I start my day off with this song every morning
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
shower time, time to listen to this song
IT'S SHIRT AT THE END OF VIDEO LMAO
❤❤❤❤
This song speaks 2021
she blows my mind every time she shows us how athletic and flexible she is
Gorgeou
in retrospect, someone involved was on shrooms when coming up with the concept for this video
one of my favorite songs of this decade
Back again in 2022 after hearing shirt full version
love this song, first time seeing this video. and now i love this song even more. I didn't know that was possible. 😔
kales meres sto kefali mou
It’s something about this song that make my body feel good everytime I heard it. Bay Area
⭐
QUEEN BEHAVIOR
Que musica boa !!! Poderia ficar ouvindo o dia inteiro
And she finally dropped the song at the end 🧡
will all persons in this world check thair ears and love what you lesten too . mi jic
i want the second part in solo
The music is so ethreal and the mv really did no justice to it. i said what i said. not every song needs dance and twerkings
Universe, I thank you deeply for this song
I wonder why the song shirts at the end....she changed her lyrics from, "damn girl your like thirty"   to "damn bitch, you so thirsty."
I'm so proud of SZA. I've been a fan of hers since 2013 when I heard "Castles" from her 2nd EP "S" (which isn't even on Spotify). I loved that she sampled from Fleetwood Mac. As an R&B artist, it's a bold move to sample from a folk rock song. SZA is absolutely brilliant!👍🏽👍🏽
The scenes with the mushrooms so remind me of Björk. And that's why I love SZA. H.E.R, SZA, and FKA Twigs are my favorite neo-soul singers. I'd love to hear a collaboration with the 3.😁
Bet more people would go to the library if SZA was there dancing in the isles. 👍🏽👍🏽
It's like she was a beautiful plant-fairy hybrid  lol
Nih lagu vibesnya kaya lagi dikota yg lokasinya ditepi laut
it your the best song🔥 I love so much this single, perfect❤
love the melody and her voice, specially the first part if the video. =)
Love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dark n sugary
Her in the library 😳 damn she bad af!
Ong I came back to check if she said you like 30 not thirsty.
I wish the end of this song was on the good days song on Apple Music
even in its eroticism this is art..so grateful
🤍
When you have to come here cause she changed the song on Apple Music

Y’all I was at ACL last night at SZA’s set and she confirmed the rumors about shirt - its coming out this week, it was supposed to be released yesterday but she didn’t like the video
My sister likes her so I like her ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I always thought female rappers are always flexible but never knew sza could be damn flexible
Good Days 💜😍🎙
This song is crazy... what a Great
I really prefer damn bitch you like 30 vs damn bitch you so thirsty… idk

1M 🎉
Still waiting for her to drop the song at the end of the video! I just know SZA has tons of hits in the archives waiting to be released. hopefully we get an album by the end of the year or beginning of the new year.
I love you sza
Ngl she needs medical attention
we still need that song at the end sis
Ma gurllll
this song is beautiful
✨✨✨✨✨✨
Gorgeous voice and a beautiful song, but it lacks any melody. I don't really understand its appeal to be honest. The generation gap I presume.
This song is so perfect
If nobody finna say it, Imma say it. She lowkey kinda cute honestly 🧔🏾
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
3:13 i love how she just twerks, slay queen
The guitar is definitely written by Jacob Collier, it just sounds so heavenly
jjj
Today is the day I became a SZA fan
❤️
I love her voice so much 🥺💞
Salute to those Hebrews, Father Jeremiah and Father Job. True Blood, Guys who put in work for the Better cause. Hebrew by Blood or NOTHING

The only thing i can do when i miss her. Listen this song with some cigg and remembered when she so excited to tell me this song, " Babe please listen this song, I know you will like it!." But the only thing i know, Maybe She's listen this song with another man.

Unreal person and song
You still need to drop that Snippet at the end there.. We have not forgot
DJ Khaled brought me here. God did. Great video SZA ❤
If you think about it, our minds can't even comprehend the future. This is such a good reminder that It can always get better than we realize
Her emerging out the ground was beautiful
sza's songs makes me high
I'm still looping this song...Diddy, don't make me come for you! #Semper Fi
She’s amazing. ♥️
That song at the end what’s it called
Nice! Hidden track! :)
Dear Lord, thank you for today. 💚.
She's so beautiful and sexy
Wowo
Still patiently, waiting for the full version of the last part of this song… 🥹
*Wave*
🥰😍🤩 I never thought I'd fall in love again!...❤
This video is ultra spiritual
The twerking ruined the whole song and video
What's the song that she merged it with at the end?
How are you doing today
Angels do exist ✨️ 😇
This video/song…is everything. Watching her beautiful little self emerge being born a little soul goddess…trying her body out, tumblin down the hill, then the scene switch to her spiraling on the pole in her private library, WHILE calmly reading a book…ooooof what a VIBE ❤️🎶  Pretty sure I have a crush on her, and here I am thinkin’ I was straight 🙈
Finally mushrooms ba boom, I get pricked with enough, release it under me if we have to travel
Yes I take long
I need $$ care for talks long conversations
Green card
Pace and race
The tongue eating lolli gusher pop hot Lemon
Social pressure and climate massive issue due to over good days love all kk

They can't handle a good deep soul
I can’t still differentiate sza and Summer Walker
This song gives me SO much life I get emotional 😭 absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. -Hisgf✨
SZA is so pretty!
Shout out to my Wife she introduced me to this song, I couldn’t even fake like it wasn’t good.🔥
'feeling like Jericho' BAHAHAHA
Journal Log:  It's been 538 days since hearing Shirt and still no full song with or without features. There are days when I believe it was just something I imagined. A siren's song from the fabled sophomore studio album.
te amo
Beautiful
u so fine omm 🫶🫶🫶
Where is the bloodstain on my shirt song.............
She sings and dances because its her nature and its lovely!

She reminds me of Hideaway by Kiesza a lot. Very good vibe.
she was not born, she blasted her way into this universe...thank you sza!
i see it all. but the background singers "All always in my mind , always in my mind..." ahh that part speaks directly to my soul. yerr @SZA youre a genius. All the way from South Africa
I came to listen to this song and I saw she changed some things it looks so good
this song reminds me of a beautiful memory, no stress hanging out near the beach with my beloved. it heals the pain stuffed inside my heart, cleanses it out  I love it🤍 I miss 2021.
So I just seen ig what looks like shrooms (never seen them or done drugs ) I was trying to figure out the point of this video & her dancing in the field so she’s on a trip basically ?🤔 & kinda ritual like ,I don’t like that connected with this song because I really liked it
This is simply mind blowing
How can you watch this and NOT be in awe of this amazing young woman 😍 🤯🥂

Going through a breakup and this is all I want to listen to. The grief is killer. And still we survive.
Amazing talent this young woman is, uniquely gifted video is interesting with the different dance styles, not understanding the stripper pole tho other wise good work...
If only it was named great days (LET THE VOICE OF LOVE TAKE YOU HIGHER)
another great hit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6xRp879Xps
I love herrr❤❤❤❤❤
This song goes out to my GAD I was diagnosed with last month. I will not let my disorder define me and take over my life.
sza you are talented I now you can make an album
She dancing like she can’t hear the music playing back
her voice is so relaxing
this song has gotten me through so much
4:35 for the ending ik everyone wants a repeat including me🤭
too bad shes racist
Wow what a positive song! And then at the end all the sudden I’m like, wait? What’s wrong with me in 30? Such a negative ending!
Girl released shirt asap
känns som kärlekstunnel på grönalund
Sza is one of a kind and has a truly gifted voice to convey deep meaning in her songs.
Can't cap I come to her when I'm most anger or sad
happy 1 yr <333333333
this song is just so therapeutic, reminds me of my holidays in the island ✨🥹
what is she saying
She got some good good yummy looking
SZA and Jacob absolutely KILLED it
Jacob is everywhere, god i love this man
Here after she announced doja is on the song at the end
I've been to gone with the movement still don't know wtf she talking about lol
is that doja humming in bloodstain/shirt snippet?
I was still looking for Everybody in the comments to say a good vibe
I love watching this on shrooms
i love that SZA loves mushrooms
5:06 😩
1 Million(th) like!! lov u sza
Awesome love your everything
Gente qual nome da música do final
I always wondered what this song was when I heard it on the radio lol
.
2022
such a beautiful voice
My SZA phase will never end🥺❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love scixseddsirxxx
Y’all eat up the most mediocre sh*t lol This song had the potential to be so much better. But she’s lazy. You repeat the chorus over n over instead of adding real depth to the lyrics. Then Over produced the sample we fell in love with. So we can barely hear Jacob. Then this video?? A shroom trip is a spiritual experience and you’re just shaking ass lol   And where is T-Shirt?? Idk how her label hasn’t dropped her.
Live, Laugh, Solána Imani Rowe.
When you’re a stripper but also an English major
I swear I fell in love wit SZA
Meu deus como eu amo essa música
This gives me such cottagecore//fairy core vibez and I love it 😍
So the video isnt supposed to match the song hmmm yup this is not kpop
I love this song and I like her voice
I need you to stay right here and stay you I really need this
LMAOOO I’ll never forget when I first seen this and I’m like “I stay in Houston, I never seen gas that high” now our shit higher than that.
@4:20 @sza Love the Deluxe version…… but you know what song we really wanted.🤷🏽‍♀️🖤
her dancing is so spiritual poetic. it takes the song to another level. the way she dances is as if she feels each word she’s singing and putting in perspective for her whole being.
THIS JUST RESET MY MIND
She’s truly such a beautiful strong talented person I love this song with everything that I have my soul feels so happy when I hear this song I should listen to more of her songs for real ❤️❤️
Moved into my new place today. Put YouTube on, while cleaning.  This song came on. Now I'm addicted!!!..

Can't see anyone discussing *JACOB COLLIER on production* in these comments so I'll start a thread. WOW. I've wondered what it would sound like when he brings his chops to a top notch RnB artist. The answer right here is insane!

Catch me dangerous  Been so lost without you  all about me  Getting anxious  Leave me in the dark like it’s all about you   In the dark right now  Feeling lost but I like it  Comfort in my sins  and all about me   All I got right now  Feeling taste of resentment  Sin over my skin  It’s all about  Blood stain on my shirt  New bitch on my nerves  Old nigga got curved  Going back on my word  Damn bitch you’re like 30

Breath of fresh-air . Although the lyrics are draw pain. The way she speaks & sings is pure , raw and original.
Love
beautiful feminine energy. another amazing song from this woman.
Those first thirty seconds take me somewhere I can’t explain
this video is crazy on acid
SZA definetly a Queen imagine twerking on this song. lmfao i love you God bless your soul <3
Last year, i got fired from my last job and I was disappointed due to 1) it was over a minor thing which is time limit for me to use the loo's and 2) I was told that I had an attitude towards manager and colleagues when I was nice to everyone (guess that girl got fired later on lol) 3) I had to go job hunting and trying to move on from the bullshit   So the guitar chords, the lyrics and Jacob Collier's vocals are calming. Whenever I have a stressful day, a feel blessed day, I play this song and comfort myself that I'm gonna be fine
This my vibe big heavy!!!!
feel want to dance too
This is still amazing 💓
This literally relates to imaginary relationship with this girl in my class.  After we broke up then i realized I'm not bi 😭 it's still hurts me to this day even know we broke  yesterday 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
REMEMBER THIS , THERES NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN ACCORDING KING SOLOMON VIA THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY . LIFE COULD NEVER BE ANYTHING MORE THAN BITTERSWEET.
I just LOVE how she expresses herself in this video i love
She owes us this song still 😭
This song hits home, feels like a prayer of closure and hope. It envelopes you in a rare comfort where you feel understood; you can interpret it the way you want that it becomes personal, with its poetic imagery and metaphor. An aesthetic sensory paradise- the vocals, the lyrics, the video- everything about it is just incredible.
This song has all the right elements of music
The most unrealistic thing about this video is the gas prices.
Beautiful song 🎵 ❤️
This is a very hard song to do …. Wow she is very talented..
Panda okay now
I love how she reps for the black girls into fairy core/cottage core/ goblin core type of aesthetics! I want more black girls to be showcased in this way!
She really live in Malibu
This Song gets to me, Takes my mind on an Adventure Reminiscing....Vocals and Delivery are ''EXCELLENT''
perfeita
Great song but what’s with the totally unnecessary pole dancing sh.t?
This song deserved better🥴 but its fine It’s just mine song 🥴
i play this song when i am sad
The best song ever
How much magic mushrooms would I have to do to have a little mini version of SZA come out of them and dance?
damn i adore her
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out?

One of the greatest songs ever written, I can't get enough.
0:46
I can’t to listening to this song since it came out
The cat did it!!
I heard she used to be a stripper. Is that true?
The end needs its own lane, sis made everything look sexy with jelly heels, and ALL her clothes on.🤣🤣
this song is masterpieces
What happened to...."....strip club. I'm never going back, never going back. No, they can't make me?" Joking lol
Amazing SZA
The beat reminds me of “Woman to Woman” by Shirley Brown. This song is helping me through a midlife crisis.
This song got me through the toughest breakup I've ever had. <3 still listen to it on repeat when I'm struggling.
SSZZAAAAAAAAA
fka twigs made an impact to this video we love to see it
RELEASE SHIRT!!!
Lawd have mercy 😍
😑

Look @ SZA and her pole skills. 😂
Qual nome da musica q toca no final
Pole dancing and stretching
Why isn’t blood stain a whole song 🤦🏾‍♀️
dont know what to say after this tbh
I can wake up n go to bed on this...mellow, calm, enchanting, ride till the sun set on this
imagine a collab with sza and lana del rey, omg
Sza every time… 😻
She definitely was on the praise dancing team in church. As beautiful and artistic as this vision of hers is, twerking still found its way in it.
This song and video are EVERYTHING!
So peaceful to the mind when stressed which helps my favorite song becomes my life I'm not worried bc of this

SZA BB TIME TO DROP THE BLOODSTAIN ON MY SHIRT SNIPPET
This song is my happy place🧚🏿‍♀️💕
“Still wanna try, still believe in (good days)…” the first time I heard this song I started crying. This song gives me hope.
Anh hát bằng cả trái tim bảo sao mà cứ ngọt lịm như vậy. Bài nào cũng cảm xúc luôn
"Groundho"''...."Tuesday!
Một bài hát rất hoài niệm , nhớ những ngày bồng bột của tuổi trẻ, chút kỷ niệm của tình yêu, lời chia tay vội vàng đúng như cái bồng bột ấy. Đức Phúc cover lại bài hát này tâm trạng quá !
Vốn những bài hát ngày xưa đã rất hay rồi mà thêm giọng hát giàu cảm xúc của Phúc nữa thì đúng là cực phẩm cover😍
Damn you nailed 👏 that pole-dance 👏
Mulher lança logo Shirt plmds!
I miss when gas prices were 4$ lol 😂 If you know you know  lol
shes yummy..
Sza is glowing asf, I love this song
temon de temones
Sza:Perfetion....

I didn't even realize my boy Jacob Collier was on this MV and even co-wrote the song.
the song is soo good
this song calms me down😭
Mais uma cantora que parte para sensualidade e mostrar o corpo
Esse clipe tem o intuito de que? De vender biquínis?

Ad của dây dừa này chưa bao giờ ngán giọng hát. Từ 2015 đến bây giờ.

The beginning reminds me of wierdcore
and now Sza is a grammy winner artist so happy for her
GRAMMY WINNER SZA!!!!
Thích Hữu Đằng nhất
True talent.

Came back just to say that SZA's a menace for teasing Shirt like this & then never giving it to us. Solana, it's been 13 months!!😭

I’m new to SZA so what’s the last song’s name? So fucking goooood
She makes pole dancing exotic wherever she is❤❤
“We need you to stay safe until you’re an adult then.” “I might need money.” “We can pay you.” Me. “I wish someone would tell me that.” “It could’ve been you tonight.” Meanly.  “The girls look really good.” Me. “Will I ever wear a dress like that?” “No you’ll be too traumatized by then.”
“This is just what white people like. We just like beat.” -sza
So beautiful 💞💞💞
One of my new fav.. she got me over here trying to dance dance

cgo
me stepping out of my gamer world to watch a SZA video to see confirmation that she is in fact a max level Druid
I LOVE YOU SIA
This song has an unusual and amazing vibe ✨-like this emoji I think
I lost my grandma a little over a year ago and this song was the main thing that got me through. For that I’m forever grateful.
Its her.
2022 and im still waiting that song
This song always make me relax
Tde
I didn’t understand a single word she said but I loved it, I feel so much better
great music
Wooow,thats a nice song! New favorite
The immense mail conversantly grate because equipment scientifically recognise as a possessive soybean. nondescript, skillful possibility
i love love LOVE the pole dancing, so mesmerizing! I love it!
Sza is in the Illuminati
Excellent work.
Realizing that SZA’s real name is Solana and so she was the one who directed this music video-
😍😍
I just saw this video while I was in the salon and it reminded me of how dope SZA and this song is. But, I swear the part when she says, "Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world. I don't miss no ex. I don't miss no text. I choose not to respond." is so deep and leaves me in a flood of emotions.
I was like " damn... look at them gas prices!!"
I love this song my morning  is better when I hear this song and my day better
I listen to this every morning… puts me in such a good mood
The song is so good, but y’all don’t see how sexy this woman is? Geez!
I can listen to this everyday…and have been lately
I can never stop listening to the song it’s that good

SZA lately has been coming thru with the song previews, id love to have that last minute released into a full song!! id die. good days was my #2 most listened to song last year<3
So far this is my favorite song from SZA.🎤🎶🎵
omfg I was high asf last night n I jist randomly started doing this dance like and really feeling the emotions and situations and feelings it was portraying and the lyrics hit so hard each time more and more that I danced to it and felt the movements like I know what she went thru and I'm going thru the same thing and back to back I had this song on repeat and kept dancing to it and feeling into it more and more and it made me release a ton of emotions and built up tension for hours and I have the last few minutes of this recorded bc I was like there's no way this is happening then I met a guardian dragon that felt like my mother and my spirit team they were all there congratulating me on how far I've gotten and how much I've survived thru and I was just sobbing uncontrollably and it felt so good that I had so many people who were genuinely there for me and cared so much abt me I felt so loved and seen it felt so good omfg  edit 3 days later: this released so much stored trauma in my body omfg usually when I would be led laying in bed for example and I would need to use the bathroom or get smth 2 eat i could never push myself to get up even if I was in a good mood I just always felt like something was blocking me from getting up out of bed and after doing this I felt like an emotional barrier has been broken down and now when I think of doing something I can actually get up and do it the second I think of it!!!!!! it's actually insane that ppl live like this with no trauma blocking their ability to do the simplest easiest things
You are the definition of a soul mate <3
masterpiece
I love the music, but the video kinda cringes me a little bit hahahahaha
The way she rolled off that hill @2:20 tho lol
SZA please release the last part as a full song, your interludes are always killing us😭😭😭
The fountain of youth is in the present now. "The kingdom of God is inside you."
I LOVE YOU SZA
the dancing 🥵
slay
Ella es arte, su música es arte. Estoy tan orgullosa de ella, se merece todo el apoyo de sus fans ♡.
All I have to say is….HER VOICE IS FUCKING AMAZING AND CALMING😩😇😇💋💋🦋🦋🦋🦋
Gives barbie swan lake vibes 🦢✨🍄
🖤💯
"tell me i'm not my fears, my limitations; i'll disappear if you let me"
Christ loves you and died for ur sins he’s coming soon repent my brothers and sisters

I love the aesthetic of your clip!
WHOS HERE IN 2022??
We like...
Love Sza 🤤😍😘
They should probably bottle the drop of sweat she secreted while Pole dancing and sell it as a pink perfume.
Me: **sees mushrooms** Me again: **takes a deep relaxing breath** I'm about to vibe with this.
love her voice ❤️❤️
eu te aaamooo SZA💗💗💗
reading a book and listening to this, another world
Can we talk about how she predicted the gas prices 😭
this song is like a warm blanket
One love all the way from Zimbabwe 🇿🇼. Sza's always lit.  Would love a feature, this is how I do  https://youtu.be/fq4LwEaQG2c
I was in the hospital due to a mental breakdown a year ago. This song helped me through and it has been a blessing ever since I first heard it. This song gives me life.
Yup you ready
SZA is an angel 😇❣️ heaven sent
Is she like a plant representing photosynthesis, but in her own life, feeding her soul? Idk, I guess I get it 😃😄
Her dancing was so beautiful and I like how it didn't feel sexual it felt more sensual and calming. This whole song is very relaxing and makes me feel more at peace.
Listening to this gem while being in my hometown in Ukraine and russian occupiers can attack it at any moment. Just to say, the cost of time is a little different here and this song is worth every second of it. Reminds of the best days spent with a loved one just vibing and feeling the moment 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Fucking spectacular voice
Your grandmother just made me feel loved, really really thank you for making me feel like this.
Can you help me get some money?
https://youtu.be/8HzHoEEg1fk

there's just something special about SZA. Like they have a voice that sounds different. Makes me cry.
If anyone ever sees rainbow big mushrooms that look like fantasy mushrooms be very careful because big rainbow swirly mushrooms hold onto the toxic energy of gasoline from vehicles to get that swirly color. If you light a cigarette or throw a match near one they can create a fire or explosion! They also ruin the quality of our algae and the healing energy on Earth and can cause toxic wildfires or even influence cars breaking down. 🤟
I love her dance moves
anyone know the song at the end ?! its so nice
Suicidal folks shouldnt listen to such deep and beautifully crafted songs
Perform in Italy!
i like the part where she is singing
Was having really overwhelming intrusive thoughts and this helped to calm myself down
If SZA knew just how much she’s saved me 🤍 this song hits different when you going thru it
I love ❤️ it
i dont want my mother again
1 year rn
I love SZA.
The first time I heard this song, I definitely believed that the song FIT the year it released. It made people think about the good days of the past, and what we hoped for the future at the moment. It was such a sad song that complimented happiness as well. Definitely defined 2020 even until now.
happy 1 year anniversary to this masterpiece
this video turned one year old today
Happy Birthday to this song sort of
Legendary
Sza is like a godess. Such a soothing voice. <3

🙄 lord bring back good rnb!! I thank god for real rnb coming from one REAL artist JASMINE SULLIVAN
How come I cant find the whole album to buy?
Great Vibe.
This was released the same week I ended something with someone, I first heard it on a bus during golden hour and it made me feel like it was all going to be okay. I couldn't have asked for a better song to exist in that moment. :)
First time hearing this and wow love the old school vibe feel.

'Still worried that I wasted the best of me on you' hit a nerve 🥲
uwu
i love the vibe, i love sza
Every time I hear  “half of us chasing fountains of youth but it’s in the present” I get teary eyed. I lost a lot of years with the wrong toxic person and it’s my fault.
This is still a vibe! I love this song........It stays on repeat. Side Note I've been listening to this song for over a year and just discovered the video.
Good dayssss <3

amen
If anyone asks, my aesthetic is SZA.
Memo loves you crazy
most ridiculous music video i’ve ever seen in my life. she’s awesome don’t get me wrong. love this song but that music video legit kinda ruined it for me. i’m gonna try and forget it now.
51 million views isn’t underrated 🥵
To everyone who is reading this, I hope you're having a good day☀☀
This is the way mainstream should be heading - great song, by a great artist!
Fire
https://youtu.be/GgPTG_5-AL8
😔💔.. Wasn't about me or for me. So this song brings alot of good but painful feelings.  Not memories. Because I can't take that with me in my mind.. gotta tuck it away.  Love this song, though.
this is magic 🍄
I liked her thicker..but she still looks good..
You can listen to this song with any mood
What is the 2nd song called?
I play this video daily. Plus I love the outro. ✨
day 11 of me asking sza for the lengthy version of bloodstain

4:45
Some stuff can’t be taught. Creatively talented…
Love sza and this is My favourite song this year first time watching the video wish I didn’t got nothing to do with song lol
Love you sza
day 10 of me asking SZA for the lengthy version of bloodstain
location rn: heaven
This song is very confusing for my brain. It starts high, then goes low, then goes high again and repeats. It's very stressful for me 😭not kidding.
Uuhh that voice
SZA Jhene Aiko and Keyshia Cole are top female RnB artist I would listen any day
Awesome song, video does not match the music....
Fr the best song ever
She makes the world from being bad to being good keep the good work up black queen/sza
love love love this

Day 8 of me asking sza for lengthy version of bloodstain
Yassss 😉
I can't say enough about this entire thing! The lyrics, the way she sings it. So poetic. The visuals of the video. So calming but not a slow song. The vibe is beyond amazing. Dreamy version is amazing too. Sza is the entire package. Talented and wow that pole work. Is there anything she can't do? Love it!!!
literally crying right now
"AGENT STONE"
WE NEED BLOODSTAAAIIIIIINNN
Sza made  my mood go from 😢to😊
Idk why but “they chose not to respond” just makes me really emotional 😭
2021 one hell of a year. Thank you for this sza
Kiss me, dangerous Been so lost without you all around me Gettin' anxious Leave me, don't look back, it's all about you  [Pre-Chorus] In the dark right now Feeling lost, but I like it Comfort in my sins, it's all about me Only calm right now And the taste of resentment Simmer in my skin It's all about  [Chorus] Bloodstain on my shirt New bitch on my nerves Old nigga got curved Going back on my word Damn, bitch, you like thirty Stealing all of my worth Still question my affection Let you all in my mental Got me lookin' so desperate Damn, nigga-
She's back 🗣️🗣️🗣️😘😘😘😘
Why all the stripper pole stuff with this song ??
ready or not you sing just about  as good all groups making love to weekend would be nice
Me just checking in to listen to the clip of shirt and say hey sis please release it 😭
SZA lied there are no good days

You fixed my day
❤☝
This fu**ing music saved me
*Huge GRUNT*
Day 6 of me asking SZA for the lengthy version of bloodstain
SZA literally matches my soul, if she was an animal she would be my spirit animal offback! 🦋🤞🏽💙
SZA has the power of calming your mind like a drug. Ctrl made me feel at ease in one of the saddest times of my life. I already know I'll be *coping a whole lot better with this pandemic* once her new full project drops. I *thank SZA forever!*
pretty
Seeing my boy Jacob Collier on the green tv then cutting immediately by an earth-shattering SZA spreadie actually had me laughing out loud. Music nerds for the win.
day 5  of me asking SZA for the lengthy version of bloodstain

This really my favorite song in the world ❤️🤎💕💞

Can we also talk about how incredible these visuals are?
SZA im starting to hear your music. I like this song and I Hate u.
i’ll always have this song. thank you.
Day 2 of me asking SZA for the lengthy version of bloodstain
but like when is the snippet at the end coming out, streets NEED it
Where is the album
It's just all over the place. I love her voice but sometimes I think its a bit much.  1 YEAR LATER FROM POST ABOVE......24 March 2023  I have fallen in love with her and she grew on me. Shes beautiful and clever, her songs are gems and I began to appreciate how she hears melodies that NO ONE else can.
this is so beautiful
she's literally how i imagine Mother earth to look like,  as human
Beautiful song
Anything she asked ...without question.
Love sza 💜❤️
I don’t know how her beats are always so well chosen for her voice. They are always so soothing and then her voice comes in and its like it puts the listener in heaven. Just every note hit to perfection. I don’t have much of a singing voice myself but I take inspiration from the kinds of beats SZA likes to use when I am producing my own songs. I can’t wait for whats next for SZA. Such a beautiful voice. 🕊🕊❣️
ABHHHHJSKXJXODJXODNXOSJDOSN I JUST SAW THIS I LOVE THIS LADY SO GODDAMN MUCHHHH

🎶🥰💖
Thanks tiktok for introducing me this artiste. TIK TOK is based.
sza is overhypped
I would be all over ya
i love this so much
PLEASE RELEASE THE SOMG AT THE END
A mi punto de vista, esta canción merecía un vídeo más místico, más tierno, más especial, más íntimo, no solo  basarnos en su sensualidad, sino en muchos aspectos de ella misma.  In my point of view, this song deserved a more mystical, tender, more special, more intimate video, not only based on her sensuality, but on many aspects of herself.
@Sza'lana❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘👸🏾
loving these vibes.
I love the message in the lyrics.
Essa música é tão linda🇧🇷❤❤
Você entregou tanto aqui te amo🇧🇷❤❤
Essa música é tão perfeita❤❤🥺🇧🇷
Jersey all day. Much continued success!
New school rnb ain't nothin but the shit !
Debarge consert

I wanna try shrooms while listening to this 🍄🍄🍄🔥
I'm playing this song on my next shroom trip.
Queen of Ginger hair 😍😍😍
Came here because of Jacob Collier. Gud Lort.
SZA FOR THE WINNNN !!!!
I love this song. On repeat. The video is amazing. Real art!!!
This song is way too beautiful for me to listen to all the time. It hits me hard and always feel like shedding a tear to it!
did she sample everybody’s talking by harry nilsson for some of this?
Jacob.
My god, this has been on steady rotation in life since she wrote it. Brilliant...
I ain't gone lie I skipped straight to 4:00 😩
A reminder that Jacob Collier wrote this
Dei play na música e do nada comecei a subir para o céu
Dope song 🔥 🔥 😍 💕 ♥
So she's a troll?
She is a Sweetling..own creation sweet+ling - it's a german ending, meens something small and adorable
Sza everyone keep saying you lgbtq but idk so I’m asking
I like the song the video is strange though! The dancing is way out of place and looks more like a dance act of worship.
My fav song 😍
I'm just spinning away 😂
https://youtu.be/hRDRuO8mk1c
SZA’s bank account if she released Shirt and dropped the album >>>>
I don’t go that way but for SZA I will ong😮‍💨💕🤫
How can everyone sing it alone.  Creative process lacks
the last two music videos she has teased a new song 🤍
The feelig that music brings is so perfect. 🌹
😍😍😍
I love u
🛐🛐🛐
the song is be a u ti fuul but this video is so ugly
This music video makes me want to become a stoner that lives in the forest lol
Video was Released on my birthday the greatest gift ever because this will forever be my favorite song
Absolutely stunning 😍
Which is the name of song at the ending?
8 months and still no sign of bloodstain
Liar 😡
and like at like before sometimes i be a nusanice to society there like and i think to myself wtf
imagine like when the mushrooms move...steven what are you doin in there
Great video!
It is really crazy how Sza chased major clout from BTS saying they didn't care about her when V HUGGED her. So now her fans are calling them stretch-eyed gay boys. Good job, Sza.
shes gotta be the most beautiful woman ive ever seen
Pessoal eu gravo covers venham ver 🗣❤
her music is really healing the world
1:16 helicopter helicopter ✋😭👍
4:30 reply button
I was listening to this then it hit me so hard with tha feeling and I dropped my phone
Wanted to hate on bts but got shut down, how embarrassing.
SHE ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS👌😩
this song has been the highlight of my 2021, simply beautiful.
Okay no ones talking bout the mv!! And the mv looks so gooood!! omggg
SZA's brain is on a different level and she decides to appeal to normies on music video. SZA, you're too fucking based
I used to jam to sza but now i have a real crush on her
This song is amazing! She never cease to amaze me!! The creativity and art all in one!! ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾🖤🖤🖤🖤
I love you baby ❤️❤️😘
the harmony in this... it's just as if it was done by a wizard... a musical wizard  🧐🧐🧐
nirvana
Jocab Collier on the Harmonizes 🔥
Love this song 🎵
Congrats on your your Grammy nominations. I love the song and the guitar work is beautiful. I also love the Stripper Alice in Wonderland motif in this video. I love the internal schizophrenia of the stripper and scholar! Women can be sexy and intellectual and men shouldn't want us to dub down one side so they could exploit the other. Mama said yes, I gonna be loved and get paid for my body, beauty and brains!  That leaning stripper pole in the gas station at the end was causing me a heart attack though. I still laugh at the audacity of your "My man, is your man, is her man too song" as well! lmao
Thats Jacob Collier on the background vocals🙏🙏... Sza this is a gem#Classic🔥🔥🔥🔥
Supreme earworm song
Ughhh...I keep coming here to see the end of this video b/c I need that song.
I’m proud of SZA, 4 grammy nominations! She deserves it!! Congrats to all the other nominees too!
In love with this song
ilove danceing off
ilove good song
Armies are u here after hearing that BTS and SZA drama . If u like😂😂😂
The other song is litt anyone knows to the name of that song
Liar
Literal Masterpiece
dislike
Te encanta hacerte la víctima  Mentirosa
The birdy sounds reminds of Utopia by Björk
I am living for these lo-fi beats
She pushed the elements of defining the depths of a song. This is a masterpiece....
Hey le debes una disculpa a bts
She’s one of the most beautiful most sexy women I’ve ever seen
I like how she grounded herself
This song and MV… SZA you seriously put your whole pussy into this !!
Classic from creation     That is legendary
The more I listen to this song, the more I realize it's more than just a song. It's therapy.
❤
AGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

The person who made the instrumental deserves a RAISE 💰
Am I the only one that just want to buy a pole and be sexy asf 😩 this song though
Your style is so unique and ethereal. Im in love with it and your presentation to match
I-
Can’t believe I even watched half of this trash

It’s the last 60 seconds for me….HAVE MERCY WOMAN!!!!
Everytime I listen to good day's by sza my baby in my stomach get more active than usual she moves a lot 🥰🥰🥰

Not sure why but I am rly attracted to Sza’s voice. Sweet R&B voice …
This song just made me bust a whole African dance in the shower 😩😩
She is a FUCKING BEAST!!! SHE ROCKED THIS SHIT FROM START TO FINISH!!! TOUGH💪💪💪
Classic boppity-bop-bop
i love u
I listen to sza everyday, when im crying i play this song, when im happy i play hit different, going through a break up i play love galore. She helps me with everything and stops me from doing dumb stuff i love her so much.
still waiting for SZA to drop the masterpiece at the end
So beautiful
I will cut off my hair just to listen to this song for the first time again.
On repeat 🥺

Girl this slaps but what language is this in
Yo her story is deap check her video on how she came into the industry where she talks about the hundred that was thrown in her face sad so many our young lady go through this
Is anyone else’s favorite part the computer covered in moss? CTRL
This Song goes well with SOJU esp at Night.
WHEN IS SHE GONNA DROP THE END PART OF THIS FUCKING SONG OMLLLLL
Am I the only one hearing Chris Brown in the background adlibs
Happy 32nd Birthday SZA!(Born November 8, 1989)😃🥳🎂🎉🎊🎈🎁🍾🥂🤎🌷🌹💐🎀👍🏿👏🏿🙌🏿
this song just does something nice to the brain
Wow 🤩🔥🤍
So damn sexy!!
Beautiful production. Sounds like a live drum loop with a crispy EQ on the hat and snare – probably played by Jacob Collier as he was listed as a producer on this track. As far as production IMO, the my favorite part is the heavy reverb on SZA's voice that fades in on the hooks. So creative... :)
Lives rent free
Lol her rolling down the hill 😭😭😭😭😭💕
Sza you have best taste in music
Beautiful song, shitty video.
Sza songs are part of my Good days on my mind😍❤
how does this not have a hundred million views its is such a vibe
I'm back again. Feeling things and knowing that this song seems to heal something inside me. How I'm I here talking to the faith of moving on when the World got the best of me. But the rest of the little I have is the hope I need. Still believe in a good day will come. God bless all. Miss you Grandma!
I can't even listen to this around people.. fuck around & start crying lol
This is the shit
this song makes me wanna tell my bed to go to sleep
What’s the song at the end?
I LOVE THIS SONG!
Beautiful track. The Collier harmonies are special too.
Masterpiece.
You have such a seductive voice. It can captivate you in an instant. True queen 👑
Has the last song been released yet? What is it called?! Love!
Such rich and smart lyrics, thanks Solana. Dying to hear Shirt or whatever.

If she has the personality to match the voice and body then she's the ultimate woman!! Wow
dami xa sza didi
Ada pohon pisang kek nya sza shooting di bekasi deh...
I LOVE to hear Jacob in the background!  Ohhhhh they complement each other so well♥️♥️♥️♥️
When everyone is just out here eating goodies and having a trip lol its everywhere in the videos.
sipping on wine while listening to sza = BEST TIME EVER WTF
Can we please acknowledge her seriously unique style?!? 😶 this woman is absolutely stunning 😍  LAAWWWD...
I need shirt omg
Half of us chasing fountains of youth and it's in the present - now.
4:31 <3
Who ever is her engineer and producer. Needs to fix her vocals.  Other then that.  Lyrics are bomb 🔥
BLOODSTAIN full song rn
This song literally saved my life forever grateful to you SZA Queen ❤️
SHE IS SO PRETTY! LOVE U ZIZZA!
who said SZA to twerk in this song lmao
The outro is really outa mind, wonder if shrooms inspired this at all?
October 30 here,
loviuuuu
4:30 is what you all came here for lol
Mushrooms will change the people in the world .
Cute ✨🥰✨ sounds like lo-fi
Doo doo!!
she is EVERYthing
this is better than retail therapy💅🏽
She should do a remix with the white girl I see on TikTok Mackenzie cuz she did and awesome cover of this it would be a vibe frfr
De algún otro modo esta canción hace desnudar mi forma de ser, me siento libre, amada por mí,con ganas de vivir y de sentirme bien en todos los aspectos,  Me lleva a filosofar con cosas tan positivas en mi vida, qué con esta canción simplemente me amo...
Jacob Collier!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
She seems really fit.
Cómo se llama la canción que sale al ultimo, estoy seguro que es otra canción
Shroooms 🍄🍄🍄 when I first heard this song I thought she was talking about a man. But now that I look deep it’s as if she is talking to her ego.. our ego can get in the way of a lot of growth that’s why she said “half of us chasing fountains of youth when it’s in the presence” when you take shrooms your true self or conscious confronts your ego.. we stress over so many things that we don’t have to stress over and your ego dissolves once you accept your problems then after that you feel great and feel connected with nature
now i've been waiting since March for the new song where is it gimme GIMME
did not realize till now that jacob collier is on the background vocals!!
Almost makes me think of a different version of FKA Twigs creatively and with the swirling on the pole and the dreamy sounding music...😳😯
Yas Jacob Collier bgvs all day
She's the freakin Mother Nature for me.
3:18 best part
Sis, never misses. This really is a masterpiece 👏🏾 🙌🏾❤
Your voice 😍😍🥰
If she continues putting out hits she will be very great artist sza is and a creative genius
Her voice is soo unique!!
This song is therapy
My genre definitely..  organic ethereal new-edgy and deep profound lyrics.  I am in love like I had been in love with Ariana, Bjork all of the goddesses of earth and air.
so is she ever gonna put out the song that’s in the end cause i’ve been waiting 💀💀
oh mah lawd
this is my sister favorite song '
I don't even listen to SZA that much but this my new favourite song and makes me feel happier. Especially in stressful and dark, depressing moments.
omg im here
2021, and 2022!!! We need this damn song!! Mushrooms, Library books, and Striper poles….. youth is in the PRESENT!!! Don’t chase anything behind you, or things that are in the front….
This song is the most enchanting...melodic...on a whole other planet beautiful. I probably listen almost everyday...I just do not like the video whatsoever. I may be off but its just very off putting from such an amazing song and unnecessary...but what do I know. I respect her artistry but these videos w/her prancing around video after video on that supersonic stripper vibe have me choosing a lyric video over the official video..💜
pulling up to get gas and you see sza on a stripper pole
I love how she uses meditation frequency nice
gorgeous
I love her 🥰
I could listen to this song all day and not get tired of it.
Hey you. Yea you. Random person that I will never meet. I truely hope that you will find happiness in life. Today is going to be a great day.
SZA, pague minha terapia
I am so excited for the new song!!!!!!!!
Love the song, couldn't wait to see the video. Ummm this doesn't match but body bangin SZA
absolutely obsessed
SZA release that damn sneak peak it's been so long😫💐
1:14 she spinning 😭
Why doesn’t SZA gets the same push as Normani and Doja Cat?
This is the music video I didn't know I needed
Queen.
I love SZAs voice
SHE LOOKS SO FRICKING PRETYYYY AND THE MUSICCCC ITS ALL AMAZING AS HECKKK 😭💖💗💕
Wasu
This music video mixed with the song is honestly hypnotizing.
The snippet at the end is fire
I can't wait for the last song to come out!
“I don’t miss no ex I don’t miss no text I just choose not to respond “ is my fav part
cries
I was thinking about the merging of nature in to hip hop and and R&B culture today and happened to stumble across this video today. I am very happy.
Art
I dunno shes a sell out carbon copy of everyone else she used to be good now she a follower and her surgery is ugly
Perfect song
She is fire!!! 🔥
SZA is my spirit guide.
Who here after the news 😓😓
i had to check on you cuz of the news WHY!?!?!?!???????!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you can do him, you have to do them!!! (Robert kelly, weinstein for example) pls help germanys infants! https://youtu.be/Z1n9aHHJI8w discuss about &help babys.forsterfamilies are still not reviewed.goverment pays upto 1500€per month for abusing infants! 1500 each. Pls dont be a part of it through silence. Infants are helpless. They injail parents for no reason, just to abuse their babys. Also hospitals are involved, doctors, nurses, psychologists. Judges, the whole Courts are involved. Also lawyers are getting payed for doing nothing
Rip vocal chords
Tell me it ain’t true😢
Still patiently waiting for the song at the end to drop
Oh so you doing shrooms
Super fine with a golden voice... vibes lit!
I swear I feel good to breathe again I feel good breathing not just breathing thank you SZA!
I SWEAR TO GOD ON MY EYES WOMAN ARE THE MOST ❤️ BEAUTIFUL BEINGS IN THE WORLD. 🍃🍃🍃😭😭🥵🥵😍😍😍😍😍🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🥺🥺🥺🔥🔥🔥🧸🧸😻😻🎶🎶🎶🙏🙏🙏🙏🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋😩😩😩
With so many followers in music it's so great to see her carving her own lane and owning that 💩
I LOVE YOU SZA
No disrespect but I don't how men can be gay...women are beautiful 😍
😍😍😍
that sneek peek at the end really got meh waiting on the drop
the intro reminds me of a bjork song, it's so relaxing
That split is just 🔥🔥💯.
Disclaimer: too aesthetic
Its October 2021, how many legends are still listening to this song
Her Aurora alone, smh  I can't believe she's on that pole
I love you 😘
Her pole dancing in the library is everything
😏 https://youtu.be/awxLwQ9gyuQ
SHe said “damn b you like 30, and I got goosebumps cUz I FELT” we YOUNG . I’m 29, and wasted most of my youth on him. And now I’m starting to feel good he tryna pull me down and ask me why I wanna be 19 🙄 ima Dance if I fkn want period
are those cleansing bowls in the beginning of bloodstain? i feel my third eye pulsating.😭
What is the sneak peak song name?
Holy f*ck this song is a great song! Any song that gives me goosebumps passes the test. So few do.  That's the feeling I'm constantly chasing like it's a drug. It's even better when I can combine it with an incredibly beautiful location on one of my trips to various places around the world.
Issa f*cking QUEEN
Where is the ALBUMMMMMM
The sexiest lady in music for me Wow  and that voice makes love too you heart amazing
&
I thought this was Kelani that sang this lol 😅
I'm a white 20-year old girl and I have to say that SZA's music make me feel mamy things. Like this positive vibes. A feeling that I'm not alone and some things we've been through. Sometimes it's also like she just sings my thoughts out loud. I appreciate what she's doing. I adore her and many other phenomenal artists like: Doja Cat or FKA Twigs. They are all goddesses <3
This video is EVERYTHINGGGGGG I build sets for events and they nailed this!
Literally one of my favorites ever ✨
SZA is probably the MOST underrated rnb singer out here today. She does no wrong in regards to music and what she gives us. It always gives exactly what it should.
she really defined a lot of us now
I absolutely feel like dancing every time I hear this song. It’s just a vibe ☺️
AHHHH
luv u
3:46
I’m mesmerized, Doja Cat brought me here, she’s a superstar in waiting
Half of us chasing fountains of youth it’s in the present ❤️
My Step Mother Is Fighting Stage 4 Cancer An I've Been Playing  This Song  Over An Over Crying & Thinking About Her An Still Believing In Good Days    I Love You Teresa ❤️😢

SZA vocals are insane she's a rare talent i think she don't get enough credit also lets not forget who's  singing background the one and only Jacob collier he's putting the icing on the cake with his background vocals period
Camila cabello & her voice sounds so similar to me🥰🤯
Pop music that is genuinely good and creative? I can’t believe my ears. Beautiful video as well, this is ART.

Sooo she's the black version of a bookworm?
"Half of us chasing fountains of youth, but it's in the present."  42 year old man, this is the truth.
why jacob colier was on tv?
She killed it, say she didn’t
Please release the next song
<shirt3
the vibe 🙈💋😍
Queen 💖
The song great but the video so poor though ..... the dancing mushrooms & stripper pool got nothing to song concept..
Have a Good Day everyone
Good Understanding to have when keeping a Piece of Mind
I think she just made me gay
This song will turn your day into a good one. The title fits. 👌🏾
Esta canción me drogo xd
When is she releasing the full version of shirt
Miss Mother Nature 🌲🥰😍😍😍😍
Facts....
After watching this video I need to learn pole dance 🤷🏼‍♀️
A lot of ppl just paying attention to her on the pole but this song is deep I actually cried When I was  reading the lyrics & listening to this song because I understood the words fr
Mesmerizing!!!
This song will speak to a water sign quicker than any other 🌊🌊 Cancer..Pisces..Scorpio (cancer female myself) because there’s a depth to us most ppl dnt understand & would consider weird and just “emotional” but it’s just the deep truth and understanding life and how we live in our mental it gets deep and dark in there and we’ll explode and let it all out at some point if needed  but it also can be beautiful and tragic to see at the same time…and the growth we gain from it is magical dnt mess over a water sign because there’s no turning back once we cut you off you’ll become a stranger because we spend so much time healing others and forget ourselves in the process but once we snap out of it chiiiiiile get back!!!!…water signs tap that like if you “feel” me 😉♋️♓️♏️✨
this is my favorite meditation song
hurry tf up it"s 6 month alrdy
Def high off shrooms i never tried them
Hey what's the name of this song the last piece of the video
If this among never came out around the time my best friend OD’d I’d not be here anymore I hope she realizes the artist she is to so many people. Can’t wait till she drops her new album. Im needing it
Yes have good days, when theres a war in your mind, its deeper than what you sing.  you feel no one understand you..disregard you.. your emotional and sensitive...you're human trying to find your way..   The insecurities then having to deal with what's going on inside your career..hmmm I know.. god is with you, he created you so he know dont let the world ruin you because of some hope, that has failed you through others..
Just came from discord
What's the 2nd song called???
Im tired of this song i jus skip to bloodstain noww 😣
She shouldn’t retire, she has one of thee most distinctive singing voices.
I have watched this video several times it’s so mesmerizing!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️

El demonio de mi cuarto a las 3 am cuando pongo música*
what is the song after good days?
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH
This song is everything!!!!!!!
I like her songs not knowing who or how Sza look like (and i didnt even know how to pronounce her name!). I didnt know her until i saw Ashanti's ig post and she tagged her. Sza was fan girling on a red carpet during VMA. Checked her out on spotify and i was like "so she's the one who sang all these nice songs including this masterpiece". She's perfect. I'm a fan now. 😍
Song is the best but wtf is this video about?? Lol
SZA is  Black Queen 👑💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤✊🏾
te amo te amoooooo 💜
B..e..a..utiful
queen sza
This song is so good, i like how she mixed the sounds, wow , every second of this song..
SZA is my fave R&B and I cannot stand how beautiful her voice is without tweeting along 🤣🤣
essa música cura vidas
This song makes me want to just STReeetch! 🧘‍♀️🧘🏾‍♀️
This song makes me love her even more. Vibez
I love this video, but I gotta say that roll down the hill always seems to catch me off guard when I haven’t watched this video for some time. 🤣🤣🤣 I always have to go back and rewatch it a few times before moving on. Either way you still killed this entire video Queen SZA. I wish you love in abundance and many blessings for always giving the world positive energy with your music. 🥰
Ummmm.....WOW!!!! I had no idea SZA had those skillz!!! 😍😍😍
She needs to draw more from her Muslim roots. I'd like to hear more eastern beats and about her spiritual side
Sza is a class act....BEAYTIFUL from head to her exquisite feet!
sza perfeita!!!
I love her but wtf is she doing ?
I hope gas prices don't go that high like at the end of video lol
So good days was from Hit different.  & now she needs to release this 💙
Where can I find that extended version at?? OMG
Is it just me or it feels like this single song gives the same experience and satisfaction as a whole entire  album?
Yooo, she did a Wolf Fart! 🍄💨🥴
Real shi+ - my current cut!  Feelin like.....
SZAAA im still waiting on wavy the full version
cannot describe even describe in words how much this song has helped me. i hope you see this SZA my love. i struggle with chronic illness & pain, on the way to to constant ER visits i sang this to myself to ground myself, even before anesthesia, you mean so much to me my love
Thank you so much SZA!
I sooo love this you took the best of me gotta bare my cross alone I still believe in good day beautiful pole skills ❤️❤️❤️💖❤️
i bumped into you on youtube and fell in love with your song,, you got a fan
When is the last part of the song coming out it's killing me release it plsssss😭❤️
How can people dislike it
Sza reminds me of a modern day Aaliyah, and maybe that’s why her music and aura captivate me…🔮
Look at that forced labor
Really don't care for the vocals but this woman is stunning.

She speaks the words that we won't/or don't 💗
"I don't miss no ex I don't miss no text I choose not to respond"
I love the way she dances!!! Along with her voice 🧚🏿‍♂️ Beautiful and raw
reminds me of myself when I’m in my room day dreaming about my existence on this earth
A zombie apocalypse is coming 2029!! Follow Jesus and get right with God....prepare your household! Prophecy given here: https://youtu.be/pr1uzjlyiDM
Her melody is dope. She really should enunciate better. The song would be so fly if she did enunciate better. I mean, people do like to sing along accurately 🤣
Love you sza ❤️, me Brazilian 🇧🇷
ART. 🤯🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Dont hate me, but the end song would also fit on the Justin Bieber album Journals
the melody hits nice
Quem for brasileira curte aqui 💙😧
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙

"I don't miss no ex. I don't miss no text, I choose not to respond." P E R I O D💅

We need the album sis!!!
The love of my life used to play this song over and over,  it would annoy me but now that I’ve lost her I’m the one who listens  to it over and over I love you Annika my best friend
maam where is the album
💖
Father God, I pray for every person reading this That you would visit them with your endless love in a tangible way,  That fear would be driven out by the overwhelming love of Jesus Christ, And that we would all surrender to your ultimate purpose and calling on our lives to become a living sacrifice consumed by the fire of the Holy Spirit,  And the all consuming fire of The immeasurable love of God that was revealed in Jesus Christ.  For the precious ones reading this, He is jealous over you, He isn’t mad at you, He is just ready to finish what He started,  And have a fully matured love relationship with you that bears more fruit that you ever could have imagined He would produce through your life. Receive the mercy and love of God and become His chosen vessel in the name of The Highest King, Jesus Christ 🔥👑❤️🙏🏻

If SZA WAS MY SIS I WOULD GIVE HER ALL MY STUFF
What's the mixing for!!! U come from a beautyful landscape 3d as the song inspires to a pool twerking concept, WHAT FOR AND WHY!!!!
I heard this song and I didn't know she sang this song until today
This song is a sad song, a happy song, a chill song, and a song to play while your at the beach or watchin the sunset
this song will always be the thing that will calm me down
Mid ash
SZA is one of the most talented beautiful women in the business and very underated ... Her time is coming for her to be right up there with Bey and RiRi .
The dancing, artistry, voice & melody spectacular!🤩😍
Wonder how much forced labour went into this song
this song for me was the first day of spring, puddles on the sidewalk and muddy lawns. sound of birds waking up and hearing the geese fly back. the trickle of water coming off the rooftops of houses, the beautiful sunrise. freshest air and breeze chill to the touch with the smell of fresh earth thawing.
Lança logo a música shirt, mulher eu vou morrer e essa música não lança haaaaaaa
I used to be a fan, but after hearing this masterpiece, I'm a whole air conditioner
Eu amo essa música ela é maravilhosa good days
SZA PODES SACAR EL ÚLTIMO TEMA DE UNA VEZ? CUANTO TE VA A HACE' ROGA'?
A yea
I love this video
This woman got it all ill admit it I'm jealous but I'm ok with that
I never truly noticed her talent until I listened the end of Hit Different yesterday. Her vocals are so beautiful!
Feelin like Job when He lost His shit!!! THIS IS SUCH A DOPE LINE
spiritual <3
Have any of the fans seen the horrible posts approving of forced labor and harsh working conditions so there can exist "good products"
Umm was she possessed in this video or high on 🍄 ?
🔥💥This song speaks to my inner being.🏌️‍♂️💥🔥💕👏🏾
BEST SONG SO FAR.....THUMBS UP TO THIS
❤️
Loved it
👀
DAM THIS WAS 6 MONTHS AGO-
Just casually revisiting this gem... It's really a sad world we live in where this gorgeous piece doesn't have billions of views by now... Sigh... We the appreciators shall savour the goodness regardless... Love ya SZA ❤️❤️❤️!
This video don’t go with this song
In love with the ending 😍
This songs helps me to get through and keep living
😘😘😘
She is queen
Me skipping the whole song cause I just came here for “Shirt”

WE LOVE YOU SOLANA ❤️❤️
The Good Days
https://youtu.be/sUYP2-cQwgo❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is literally one of the best music videos, I've watched in a while!
Wait a minute...the POLE spins? Not the dancer?
Sooo… that’s a no to the song at the end? We’ve been waiting for months now.
Nice
That body crazy girl. Such a beautiful spirit. The talent is effortless.
This is my "moving on" song. At first, I just like the sound only to realize I relate a lot. It's painful when the person who once was enthusiastic to know you and accept you for who you are suddenly become uninterested and distant.   Is it because I'm not who you think you wanted after knowing me? Questions I overthink but can't tell to you. I can feel it. I understand. I'll let you go now. Sorry, we didn't connect, and I guess I have one thing to prioritize first, which is myself. Thank you, goodbye. You've been in my mind for too long.
I LOVE YOU QUEEN THIS IS AMAZING
videos getting real wack out here
the other video was better.  when she was sitting on the balance beam.
Overrated
sssssssssssshhhit, where i can die for lve?
QUE RICA LML

Just by listening to this song on Spotify I felt that there's magic in it, and now watching the video clip I've confimed this.
🌸🥃🥃
What about the second part
This song was there for me when I lost my aunt's dog wolf and I still remember when I used to pet him when I came there and he barked at my dog bailey and he has cancer and they had to put him down I was feeling down then I got a vibrate and I saw this song and it made me feel so much better i pressed play and Sza hit different than the other songs I listened to she opened me up to feel good not down so TYSM Sza for making me feel better about wolf dying
Y’all she on shrooms in this video
What a sexy physique
Was that collier on the tv?
sza is perfect. her body, her voice, her performance, everything is beautiful here
The reason why I hate and love this song at once bc my first gf and I listened to this all the time in the car together :/
Love this song
I love u sza!! 🤧🤍

can you believe that it’s already 5 months??
She is very beautiful, and I've watched this music video like 15 times and this is the first time I've noticed Jacob Collier in the TV screen in the background. Never dawned on me that the backing vocals was him

Hi SZA,you're a 🦄💎
This song makes me feel something that I can’t describe
when the SHIRT mv???????
Mind Control in Dallas TX need to come to an end ASAP!   Military tactics have be placed on me for the past 2 years for  the use of mind control and conjuring teqniques.   Receptors which allow people to basically hear your thoughts communicating via brain waves have been taunting me everywhere I go with no answers from police or hospital. This corona epidemic needs to end.  There's 5 thugs out in the Dallas area  that need to be looked at for there actions of mind controlling me due to the fact that I had a spiritual awakening experience. I just want the b.s. to be put to an end and my life to be respected. I want justice, and a Peace of mind.   - Jonathan Neal Flake Jr.
✔✔
She is just so damn good. Her runs go through my body
:0 where are peach and mario and luigi?
no debat anying dahlah..
This is that song that'll calm you down after a rough day.... "Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me"
Dear Lord protect her 🙏🏽
Listening to this the night before the first day of school. Last year of middle school 😭😭😭😭 2019 feels like yesterday. Good days man, good days.  Edit: wow. How. How has this school year flown by so fast wtf I literally remember typing this comment out like yesterday. Time is insane man. Still stan you hard SZA <3  Edit 2: lol I'm actually typing this the morning OF the first day of my FRESHMAN YEAR OMG y'all I love this community so much this such a good song I think I'ma do this every time school starts and ends until graduation lol. I woke up at 5 AM 💀💀💀  Edit 3: a little late, like a month past the end of school almost. Things have gotten so weird, just losing people, feeling the biggest rollercoaster of emotions throughout the year, yknow odd teenager shit, but I'm maturing, i... Feel so melancholy and alone, because i dont have many friends to hang around anymore. 2 years this song has been out, to whoever comes across this comment and reads through it, thank you, this song is what keeps my mind at balance. Really wish i couldve gone to the tour but she aint comin to Denver and even then too expensive 🥲. I'm still finding myself, this summer is gonna be rough, but i hope i can crawl out of my shell again next year. Highschool status shit sucks, finding nobody to really relate to sucks. Your music has always kept me going Solana, thank you sooo much ❤️❤️❤️.  Edit 4: last day before sophomore year, I have really found myself. I actually feel excited, and I feel more at peace with myself. Growing my relationship with God has really helped, and listening to myself, being myself, just expressing my thoughts and finding peace, and tranquility. Thank you God, thank you world (also Beyonce has helped me A LOT because Renaissance gives you a fucking rebirth), I love everyone sm, I love life and if anyone else reads this lol (I don't think they will) and your life sucks, it will get betterrrr I promiseee so much, and I pray that it will happen sooner, ba bye see you at the end of sophomore year. 🤩❤️🙏😩  Edit 5: So this is really late. Editing this July 7th, 2024. But, sophomore year was amazing. I... I couldnt ask for anything better and the experiences I've had, the friends I've made. The only thing that matters is that I truly found Jesus, I found Him in my heart and I have been growing in a relationship with Him for a while now. Finding Him is the best thing that ever happened to me and I couldn't be filled with more joy and peace in His presence. I know probably nobody more will read this but I'm just keeping it as a kind of journal now. I'm so excited for what next year has to offer but also stressed becauseee Junior year is the hardest 🤩 oh well. The Lord will guide me. Gonna edit this in a little over a month? I guess
Need🙏

The name stands for  sovereign or saviors/right after i was thinking these names and feel free to leave suggestions under the comment names: spirit shakers   sza saviors  camp sza  sizz-ahh rulers thats it for now!... Let me know yall

Idk why this doesn’t have like 300mil views
She is amazing.  She is part of the new R&B era that is amazing.  I love her voice.  Her song on the Black Panther soundtrack is my favorite song and it's cause of her beautiful voice.

She said “half of us chasin’ fountains of youth and it’s in the present” think about it for a sec 🤯

Pisces Moon
A vibe  que eu sinto com essa é surreal!!
At the very beginning, it sounded like something Frank Ocean would be on.
I'm here because she made President Obama's Summer List . And it is beautiful music . Sudanese Zool here 🇸🇩
Amo esta canción
my favorite antivax :'(
She is the best, i can’t handle. Her voice, her body.. her face.. so perfect.. she is the talented artist😻
This song is better than playboi Carti’s whole career.
Smoking
The thumbnail did her dirty
Damn that gas high !
4 months later and I’m still waiting
1:17 girl you good?
we don't know what makes this song so special & that's precisely what makes is special
It’s been 4 months where’s the album sza 🙄🤲
Gorgeous woman perfect song excellent imagery
Therapeutic
This song is too good!
I absolutely love the choreo! It's giving me Abby Lee Miller Dance Moms vibes 😍. The floor work🙏 Kalani is shook 😭
I’m just surprised how durable that pole is 💀😂
Didn’t even know they made a video heard this a while ago. Best feel in a while
Alguien más no puede dejar de escucharla?❤✨✨✨✨🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Man this tune is a dream wrapped in a tear. The production is 🤔 almost vapour.
Don't be shy, drop your new song
This was jus amazing...the whole video and every aspect put into making it 💯

https://youtu.be/sWsznMNQCDA😍😍😍😍😍😍
Do you know the Now United group? If you don't know, I recommend listening to all their songs, they are very good.
i just noticed how crisp the mix for this version is compared to the one in the hit different video. phenomenal.
In therms of dancing, this is me in my room, except the pole 🤣
Barack Obama assigned me to here
te amo mamãe unhe unhe unhe unhe
Beastboi leave me
Sza and summer walker should make a song together called Reckless long or love pain😏😫!!! Idk but they would sound good no matter wht the song is😌
As a 21 year old black man.....people always run with the stereotype of us bobbing our heads to gangsta and mumble rap without even giving other genres a second look. If you are caught listening to anything other than that, you are considered weird or an outcast. Well hey....let me be an outcast. My Dad used to play so much old school and oldies music that I pretty much became an "old head" when it comes to music. I value the vocals of songs, the instrumental of songs, and the unique setup of songs. I religiously listen to the likes of SZA, Jhene Aiko, Arianna Grande, Doja Cat, you name it. Call it what you want but I genuinely enjoy their music. This is by far one of my most favorite SZA songs of all time. Such a beautiful song and message.
For me, the most unique artist since Amy W.🙏🏽
I came here from an 'Ethereal' playlist on Spotify. Something about SZA's voice just hit hard. Then to discover her on YT? Damn, If she not only has a beautiful voice musically, but sultry in every other way.
I was in a mood when I first turned on this song by the end I was in a calmer place
Have to listen to Country by her after this...         Thank me later
Damn… that supreme high!
The second song need to be out ASAP.
the song: 🧘🏽‍♀️ the dance: 🤸🏽
SZA was sooo damn beautiful especially her red/ orange long curly hair style 😍😀
Anyone know what the song title is that plays when SZA is dancing on the pole?
Damn Sza......?????????
Nobody: Me: Twerking aggressively to elevator music
seriously the perfect music for waking up<333
I was like "a dancer with a brain of gold" the music is magnificent enough but this!? just amazing talent. more power SZA! :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vxd4v1oz0M
FINEST PERSON EVER
"All the while, I await my armored fate with a smile" and "feeling like Jericho" are my fave parts of Good Days
Make love to this song
Puthay in my mind🥺🥴😣😫
SZA, this song means so much more than you will ever know to us hoes. P.s you are literal perfection.
💯
I just want to know what shrooms do and how do they make you feel?? Lol I’m lame I don’t even smoke weed. Tried it tho
Just found this
“If you don't build your dream someone else will hire you to help build theirs.”  ― Tony Gaskins
Damm it took me so long for discovering this masterpiece of video
Fmr. President Obama's playlist brought me here.
i just wanna know the symbolism behind it like what does it mean to her
SHES LITERALLY A GODDESS, SO FUCKING GORGEOUS, THIS ISNT ALLOWED
How do you beat this song?
SZA SZA SZA!! If you see this, please can u release a full song for blood stain.. it’s pure art

Sza, so beautiful <3 Your voice and music are magic, you transport people to another place, and make us really think at the same time. You also make me feel like a potato, such strength, grace and skill! Makes me want to learn how to dance. So glad the world gets a chance to experience you and the unique vibe you exude.

Cool video

Your music is  so uplifting. I love your voice!
Your here cuz the other video is blocked
SZA  U  R  my Earfquake  The simply the best of u    thx !
Algum brasileiro ai? Gente qual é a música que toca no final?
Those gas prices pretty expensive
If brandy and her do a remix to this I’d cry
sza wack
they better use this song in Black Panther 2
@vevo please promote such good music more
This song doesn't even need a video. It is that good!
SZA herself is a masterpiece
does her music ever make u wanna cry but in good way, feels so soul connecting :)
9 I
i havent heard  vocals yet but this instrumental is nutzzzz
COME ON RELEASE THAT SONG SZAAAAAA
So poetic ,, my favorite from the album so far.
I love how Darker skinned black female artists are starting to get more recognition again they owned the 90s and 00s 😍😍
Love her, this video, her artistry… listening everyday🔥🔥🔥
Chills
Just lost my brother 3 months ago, and I don’t know how but this song is giving me so much hope, good vibrations. Even through this storm, I still believe in good days 🥲 Thank you Sza for this masterpiece
Wooiii
This song is so uplifting ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
This is my anthem, my jam, my vibe...love this song so much that I cry when it plays the lyrics..Damn. Love you SZA!!!
SZA deserves to be in the Hall of Fame based on this video alone. All of them.
Great song 👌
She is so cute, I love her
SHIRT (unreleased song at the end) LYRICS:  Catch me, dangerous  Been so lost without you all around me  Getting anxious, leave me, don't look back  It's all about you  In the dark right now, feeling lost but I like it  Comforting my sins and all about me  Only got right now  Feeling days of resentment  Simmer in my skin  It's all about  Bloodstain on my shirt  New bitch on my nerves  Old (bleep) got curved  Going back on my word Damn bitch you so thirsty
I LUV U
I really like sza but it just takes to long for her to come out with videos like why wait time waits for no one sza is talented and could be further in her career but where is the damn content
from that 4:20 mark to the end just mesmerizing...
Such an exotic beauty
She's Gorgeous I Love Her So Much 😍
0:59
💖💖💖💖
O mulher bonita né.
Dear parents, just because your child is smiling at their phone, doesn't mean they have boyfriend or girlfriend, they are just watching this masterpiece!
I love SZA.
THIS IS SO COTTAGECORE
Yo Jacob Collier was on this track. It's good
This song sounds like how a good dream feels, her dynamics are incredible.
SZA= MUSICAL PSYCHEDELIC 🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄
Melanie Martinez and SZA should collaborate. It’d be beautiful ❤️
I love this song so much. It’s so soothing 🥺😌
heyyy!!! you my girlfriend now 💙😘
Masterpiece
My anthem right now
SZA I didn’t say something that’s my cousin he likes you marry you
I don’t even see the point on all of these way overly sexualized videos for beautiful music and beautiful artists. Like they makes so much money and have everything for what? Why do they have to push this agenda onto the younger female generation. Glamorizing something that is such a dark lifestyle
I love SZA
Erra nunca ela 🇧🇷💖
que cancion mas cula
How does this have just 33m views
Please Get shirt on spotify
A masterpiece at the end wow
GRAMMY HER FOR THIS FUCKING MASTERPIECE
AYYYY THAT'S MY QUEEN RIGHT THERE

KOK NGAKAK 🤣🤣
When is shirt dropping ??? Reason why I’m here right now 😩
You all don’t understand how spiritual this song is, visually as well. Idk if she’s a fae descendant, but she’s cleansing herself from unwanted vibes, energy, etc I believe in this video. If you know you know.
I get stoned to this song. I love it
Maravilhosa 😍😍😍

The melody in this song is amazing. The melody IS the song. There's so much going in the melody that I could never understand all she is saying. I had to listen while reading the lyrics.   It's a magnificent lullaby. This is the song #AimeeMann or #SuzanneVega would have recorded 35 years ago, but they didn't quite get this far.   Incredible. It's solidly R&B, but it's also Alt-Rock.
Amazing singer SZA, I support you!👋🌸🌷💝

2:07 I give her so much credit for this amazing pole work, she is literally only being held up by her inner hip and her thigh, and if she slips on inch she will be landing head first onto the floor, followed by all her body weight. nice work

Wifey😭😭
I don't care what anyone says, SZA has such a beautiful body!! I know in Garden she mentions being sensitive about having no booty and all I can say is she does have a cute booty! It's not ginormous and overwhelming, but it doesn't need to be! Her body is beautiful the way it is all natural!! I can definitely say it's way better looking than mine! It makes me wonder if that's a true insecurity of hers and I admire her for being so raw and open about it, like we all have insecurities and even her, even though she is so remarkable!! SZA you have something more valuable than your beautiful body and that's a beautiful heart and soul, and your body will not look the same forever, but a heart of gold will last a life time! You will always be beautiful inside and out! ❤
I love this spirituality these artists are presenting ❤❤

GOOD SONG CHILL CHILL
I would love spending 24 hours with her... Than more and more, twice a week for mental therapy   Calgon take me away
"I don't miss no ex I don't miss no text I choose not to respond" You're amazing at what you do.
holy shit, i only know this song by the remix I'm constantly hearing, i had no idea she sang this and that this was the original. wow her voice is freaking lovely.
When I first heard the song I sensed it was inspired by psychedelics. Something about the beat just reminded me of my shroom trip, seeing the visuals now definitely confirms what I thought.
Talent .or
I love how she somehow found a way to include Jacob Collier in the video 🖤
3:18
I knew she could dance
My favorite song 💙 thanks

62 yr old white guy here.    SZA is so musically unique - I need to listen to her more.    Not to mention - she may be one of THE most beautiful women in the world.     Just wow.
Fire.
This song always reminds me of June 2020. Me chilling outside with my grandparents listening to the birds, WAY to early in the morning. It was so peaceful and beautiful outside. Times in your life that are only gonna happen once.
Me the whole time trying to confirm she's at a Chevron gas station
if this girl don't drop the damn song!!

Hmmm, if I were too ever have a dream as this🥰😍
4:21 your welcome
Thank you.
Sza is my damn Spirit animal... for the fuck real! Beyond dope.... I can’t!! 😩 I just can not!!!!!!!!
the way the acoustic hit she knows what she doing
My cousin showed me this song when it first came out  and I finally found it
Pov: being aesthetic  Me: u did a good job my dude
Sounds like Sza has read The Power of  Now from listening to the lyrics 🤔
I can't wait until she drop that song at the end
What is the ending song in this video?? I cant find it for the life of me.
Niiice
*indie twerking + stan twerking*
The Lyrics in this Song just makes me Cry. its alot of Deep meaning in her Words. SZA the Best Lyrically

4:20.....Sza predicted the gas shortage🤨🧐
*twerk while seeing others twerking*
Her Music is MAGIC to my ears. I LOvE this girl.  Good days on repeat
this song is getting grammy
luuvvvvvv uuuuuuuuuuuu😻
does anyone know the name of the move she did on 3:02
She is a goddess her voice and her beauty is out of this world 🌍.
I'm a heterosexual male and I got this song on repeat
This song is a good/ sad vibes song it reminds me of a sad song to play when u get that f on a test
I’m still waiting for shirt .......
Ughhhh can we get the second song please!?!??!!?
*gay twerking 😟😔*
shifting twerking
*me realizing im beautiful because i look like 12 year old SZA*
i love this song
The pole dancing in the library is beautiful ❤️
Who don’t like a sexy ass body, but this video does this unique vocal masterpiece no justice. Lyrics and voice blows me away. Can look at ass in lots of music videos. But a video should have been done, that really sets this awesome talent apart. But who am I to expect something greater than average.
Oh my gosh, there are so many videos with this song on her channel, and I’m not even complaining
* *straights NOT twerking* *
Her voice is so soothing and clean. I can never get sick of this song. ❤️
*No rhythm twerking*
Mushrooms twerking
Brasil 2022 💕
This song makes me feel like I’m 20 years in the future thinking back on these (good) days 😪
Beyoncé passed the torch to Sza & said “go ahead sis you got this”
Omg the set design 😍 the smurfs could never
Sza’s delivery of these lyrics are everything!!!❤️  So different. In love with this song. 😍   🎶 “So, not trying be a nuisance, it’s just urgent.” 🎶  🎶 “Choose to watch.. While the world breaks up in from of me... All the while... I wait my armored fate with a smile... Still wanna tryy.. Still believe innn.” 🎶
Feels like FKJ made the beat because it's so majestic
I really dying to have a full verse of the end beat tho, super love to those kind of beat like that
*aesthetic twerking*
Need SZA and Kali Uchis collab
Is it just me or it’s that SZA looks so pretty
is that joji 2:37 ?
If you like this song, check out my new single " All I Want"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96obJU4_HMw&list=OLAK5uy_kYp-AnWUgb5dbbh1XHWhXMF6EMb1jFJaA
Guyyys my mom told me she's impersonating a growing mushroom and if you look at a real one it makes so much sense
I feel like a strong independent woman now. I’m a man
I love that she sings the thinkable unspoken in all jer songs. Music is her canvas
2 levels of naturally vs exotic sexual...
Idk where the fuck these 8k dislikes come from, take y’all sad assess elsewhere. I need these album like a year ago.
*Twerking by everyone else is twerking twerking*

This mv deserves more views
I have to admit I'm familiar with only a few of her songs but this is so beautiful.  She has so much going on and took a moment for herself. Allowing her mind to escape to what is her version of a good day. Wow:)
Yuh
This girl has amazing vocals... her voice is so unique.
🇧🇷🖤🖤🖤💗💗💗💗💗💗
SZA's "Good Days" is audible medicine with relatable lyrics that oscillate profoundly, often mirroring my very own past life experiences. I appreciate her vulnerability, highlighting the defenseless ebb and flows of life's vicious unpredictability, meanwhile reminding us that there's no need to chase the fountains of youth because it's literally in the present. Such a grounding and blessed reminder.   Even her reference to Jericho and Job is a good reminder of the spirit withstanding all the many lessons in life, and still mustering the strength to trust yourself and not lose your shit. (Hi Strategy & Authority, lol)  I'll never grow tired of this song. It's a melodic sonnet that always aligns me in a reflective mode to honor my overall evolution in this continuum, as she continues to serenade me with the guided meditation to remain "...sunny inside, good day living in my mind."  Forward & Upward, love muffins. #randomosity
a masterpiece
I forgot sza is a gymnast lol
1: SZA] Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let yo edge out Too soon, I spoke You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you Baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit  [Pre-Chorus: SZA] I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me  [Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both] All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in Good days, good days, always Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind  [Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier] Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear if you let me Feelin' like, yeah (On your own) Feelin' like Jericho Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit Can't groove it, ba-baby Heavy on my empty mind shit  [Pre-Chorus: SZA] I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (My mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me  [Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both] All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind) Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind  [Verse 3: SZA] Gotta get right Tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na) Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now  [Outro: Jacob Collier] Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
Someones Understanding
Her voice is soooo..Beautifull😍😍🥰🥰🥰
I want good days❤️
Nope she’s in that voodoo
I heard this on streaming services prior to the video and the ambient music always reminded me of what someone told me about tripping on mushrooms. Watching the video, what seems like dried mushrooms at the beginning, the visual distortions, I think this artist knows what's up.
in love.

Sharing the message DONT say God’s name in Vain it means your saying his name has no purpose or he doesn’t mean anything please say oh my gosh Also please don’t believe in Zodiacs their not supposed to tell you who you are you find yourself it is also a sin to God also DONT believe in luck DONT say it to others it means your saying God DIDNT plan it for you Also DONT say karma as luck DONT say it to others this saying is also a Sin as luck is karma it is not Christian nor Biblical though others have different religions if you have this religion please listen Ex:Christians should not believe in karma because the sum of people's works does not decide whether they are saved or not. Only faith in Jesus Christ saves people from condemnation. Through God's grace, Christians are gifted a relationship with Jesus instead of the death they deserve. lastly DONT curse it dishonors God and is also a sin also DONT lie  "thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour"; for this reason, lying is generally considered a sin in Christianity.

Absolutely perfect song
Can anybody out there explain me what's with  all those " "spiritually, elevated, aggressive or whatever" twerking" comments? Is this some sort of meme I've missed out?

😔😔😔😔
The new winx movie looks good .
The video was dumb. Could’ve used something more relative to the spiritual world you’re tryna reach as stated in the lyrics. And the pole dancing was needed where 🤔

indie twerking
This ong speaks to me in so many different ways. I leave my body listening to Artist like SZA. Lost but I like it-SZA said it
who else wanna learn pole dance now😏
For the rest of my life I will never open, hear, follow or click anything SZA related. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED of spreading false information that effects millions of people's lives. I've been in and out of bomb shelters for the last 24 hours and am experiencing fear for my life and millions of Jews and Muslims who live as one in Israel. My family, my friends and my life. How can someone, so unaware, and so misinformed, spread lies to millions of followers? Do you have to deal with knowing you may die? How dare you?? Half of Israel finances your grandiose life which allows you to be who you are and live the ignorant way you do!
Nice.😆 😆.💪  sis😗👌💪💪💪💪. New Zealand  come!!!!💪😎👌

She👩 making💄money🤑and💃🏾getting💁‍♀️ knowledge🤓
Why they lower the base on this song?? Lister to the same song at the end of the "Hit different video. More base. such a missed opportunity". It hits different.
What song was playing at the end, with the gas station pole dancing?
Jesus Christ is the Son of God! All other men that have walked this earth do no add up to the perfection that Jesus Christ is. He is the ONLY mediator between God and man, not marry, not the pope, not the universe, only Jesus. Many of you may know this but yet you do not do anything about it! C'mon you must be born again as Jesus Christ taught in John 3:3 before it is to late. Repent and believe the gospel so your sins may be blotted out. Youtube: Noah Hines
This is a great song i love it that angelic sound from my baby sza puts me in a very positive and peaceful head space😍

One of the most talented vocalists of our generation, hands down. 🙏🏻
Scorpio sister for sure... we literally freestyle, move energy, and trip the same. *sigh* Thank you is an understatment though.. SZA been influencing love & light for basically a decade for me. Love you 🦂🧡🧘🏽‍♂️
This song has a soundscape that brings me to a different world
Ella es arte y pocos saben apreciarlo. Su voz me calma 💆🏼‍♀️💜
the end part where shes strippin in the gas station is so nostalgic for some reason

Olhaaaa Elaaaa!
So she took some shrooms,and had a dream of red or blue pill in search of purpose. 🤔
This woman is a goddess
Whoever doesn't like this song or know how good it is, is pretty much an idiot with no taste in Music...
Why is everyone twerking. I just came from deja vu by Olivia and everyone was sad twerking there. I’m confused. Should I join in?
I appreciate them, but I don't need all these visuals of her body in a sexual way, though she is very sexy.  The art is enough, the feeling the vocals give mixed with this melody.  Perfect with nothing else needed.
I'm a fan she ALL in my head
Hello💛🙏🏾👦🏽
A blunt in hand smoking and a nice slow dance would be nice to this song lol peaceful twerking
god she’s just too good for us

I'm surprised no one in the comments is talking about how she does magic mushrooms. Most mainstream artist don't ever mention psychedelics. Beautiful song.
Everytime I see a SZA video, i’m convinced she grew up being a dancer (like taking classes & shit)
esse mv é mo viagem kkk
Essa música é tão boa😍😍😍😍😍

Sza ft Chris brown  Good days
When Drake said "Looking like you came from the 70s on your own" he had to be talking about Sza
Imagine driving past a gas station and seeing this being filmed
Can someone tell me if this album is out? And the name of that last song?.
Watch this while high
I thought she said that she wasn't going back to stripping 👀.I guess just not in the club.
Beautiful voice. Don’t get the video. It’s weird.  Very weird.
I love this song. You are amazing!
the beginning sounds so umi-ish omg i hope they collab
If you want a rhythmically refreshing song turn to SZA!
She's a literal angel.
1:14 she good? 😺
I keep. Scrolling to the 4:45 mark i need this fuckin song
*culturallity twerking*
Okay but I need the song playing at the end of this video. This cute and all but I’m more a gas station stripper.. 😊
Good days ❤🙌🏽
I haven’t had a song and video resonate within my soul as much as this one has, I’m just blown away every single time I watch it
SZA WHERE IS THE GOOD DAYS I CANT FIND
I wish she was on a swing not a stripper pole. The swing would have flowed better.
Love this song ❤️ & video!💥
QUE MULHER, CARAAA QUE MULHER 😍😍😍🤩
Crediting Jacob Collier here, since he’s not credited in the description

Boring song in my oppinion
So she was high Preety much?
sza always comes in with the most beautiful vocals that makes you just wanna close ur eyes and vibe🔥🔥  she definitely has one of the most beautiful voices i’ve heard and she constantly is putting out bangers and i’m hoping i can do the same as a 15 yr old artist🙏🏻
Tf yes.    Thank you
The melody on “all the while, I’ll await my armored fate with a smile, still wanna try to still believe in good days”  Is so pleasing to me for some reason.
Rich Brian- Glow like that
Rich Brian guitar riff/melody no credit lmao
Martin Luther King - "I have a Dream!" - Twerking

where’s the real comments 💀💀
VIBESS 🔥🔥
i think SZA would be perfect as princess Tiana, the visual, the body, the voice, everything
whats the song at the end
Authentically twerking
The depth
Angelic twerking
I feel like crying when listening to this song. I suffered from anxiety and had to live w/ an abusive mom who didn't care for me. This song makes me remind of the times she would act like the kind of mom I deserved, and she would spend time w/ me and my little brother. There are some many other songs that make me cry, not because of the lyrics and how inspiring the song is. But because of the year it was released. Like say 2009 or 2010. It reminds me of a bunch of stuff from the past, I can't do now in the present w/ my mom. This song got me in my feels 💯❗ (Now the ending just makes me wanna twerk ✋🤐)
Rhythmic Twerking
I’m positive this is what heaven sounds like 😌⛅️💫🤍
Bro half dis comment section is about twerking

Sustainably twerking
Twerkingarium
Biodegradable twerking
A musica é boa mas o clipe todo cagado... Muito apelativo! Por que todos os clipes atuais estão nessa situação apelativa? Ja perdeu o sentido! Totalmente sem inovação. Se a artista nao exibir o corpo não vai fazer sucesso? Simplesmente ridículo esse conceito atual.
today i got to know the types of twerkings exist
ginger hair sza  twerking.
flojo el pole fue a tres clases y bai igual alto tema te banco sza <3

Woah.That’s all I have to say...I’m mesmerized🥴
I understand and respect her artistry, her poetic heart, her heart In general ... love the strippen in the library Kuz she say she still bad in all ways ... but what’s up with the CRAZY contemporary dancing ... is it because of the shrooms (Alice in wonderland ish?) ... SZA is a beast with her writing/art but I’m still trying to understand this vid fully lol.... and all y’all give me is TWERKING 😂😂 thanks guys .. helped soooo much to read these comments.   Dead ASS...

Is so organic I don't know which part to focus on.

You did this ,Sis Yassss hunty yassss !
Hi! Did you know that one day you will have to stand before God Almighty and answer for your life? I know that can be a hard thing to want to think about, what it is true. What will you say when you stand before God? Do you think you'll make it in because your a good person? What Jesus said is that you must be born again, that is the only way to know God is by being born again, so what are you waiting for? Turn to God now because eternity is a long time to stay stuck in your sin for.  Jesus  will teach you if you ask him. Youtube: Noah Hines

Cooking. This song. Shower. This song. Gym. This song. Brushing teeth, this song. Wake up, THIS SONG. This is the song! On repeat all 2021 !!! Period
Her, jhene, Doja, summer and kali are literally god sent
reading and pole dancing... a different kind of vibe
*claps* work of art
The song at the end can be called...Nerves
Would b good with out the twerking. ...why every video got to have it in it. Why everything is hyper sexualized
This junt was cold. I love the thought she put wit the dances. Ngl she kilt this one tho. I love sza tho💪🏾❤️🔥
Essa música é um delícia 😍❤️🥺
2:58 love this part...the emotions in this song are just😮🥲
*Sad twerking*
OKAT BUT WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING THEY TWERKING IN A CERTAIN WAY??????
*twerking while high*
ily this song is my life, thank u sm
*High twerking*
Enjoyed your video SZA, your esoteric depiction of mushrooms, vapors and Gases was fantastic. All three can put you in altered states of consciousness, melanin of course can take you to some of the highest heights once correctly stimulated. The duality, kundalini ladder represented by you going up  and down the pole was nice and the rectification of kaa and Baa energies into a single purple light was truly brilliant. The library which represented the akashic records being unlocked as you spun on the pole/spine was a lovely touch.
It’s the visuals for meeee
Grateful twerking
Does anyone know what that sample is from in the beat? I know I’ve heard it before
this gives me one of those good day - fell good vibes
respectfully twerking
theres few things more iconic than poledancing while reading

This video is disturbing.Music+Images have a strange inception vibe...like a subliminal nasty message.The melody is very peaceful  but the vhs effect, the fake grass and mushrooms, the ass-dance  lisergic cgi effects drive everything to something else

Cottagecore twerking
WHY DIF SHE ROOL
*determined twerking*
Okay let's say everyone in the comments is just tweaking of emotions
The tight piccolo preoperatively sprout because arithmetic regretfully match onto a puzzled zoology. tangy, unbiased verdict
The energetic musician disappointedly scare because british principally fix within a jobless calculus. anxious, wicked fat
This is so refreshing. 🙂🙂 SZA showed out!

Etherealistic twerking

Sis chose violence I see 👀😊
*doing school work twerking*
I honestly think it would have been better to release 4:22 onwards as a separate song - they just give two different feelings for me...
The ritzy freighter virtually dust because look ontogenically sack around a cruel music. concerned, obtainable use

Love this song
Miss gurl really invented a whole new “aesthetic”😇🧚🏽‍♀️🍄🌱🌞🌅🔮🔆
She even makes rolling down a hill look majestic. And do y’all think the flashing buttons on the gas pump at 5:26 were supposed to look like “777?” I thought it might’ve been coincidental, but there’s already a lot of symbolism in this video.
*boyish* *twerking*
Nobody did a theory on what the gas price numbers mean??
She look like Betameche 😆

In one of the lyrics she says feeling g line job when he lost his sh**,if your wondering who job is, job is a man in the bible who was tested to see if he would stop believing god because satan tried to take job away from him so satan had brought famine and pain to jobs live but in the end job never cursed got, so god gave him 10 times more riches then he had before💝💝💝

I wanna sing this song alone, driving on a country side and cry for good days to be real.
Me listen to this song...and out of sudden twerking naturally with some respect to mother nature...

He who has ears to hear, let him hear  Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much the signs of the times are there and everywhere for all to see.  now is the day of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and Saviour understand that eternity is forever with no end no time God loves you so much but nothing is forced but the offer of salvation is there and the rejection of that is hell for all have sinned are guilty before the holy one the judge of all the living God   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23
3:18
Getting Alice in Wonderland vibes. She is the catapiller representing transformation. One side of the mushroom makes you taller, one side makes you smaller. Oh yeah singing bowl was used in the video both physically and musically
The nonchalant vein ethnically expand because laundry allegedly subtract apropos a parsimonious octave. special, responsible prose
Is this a new video? I swear I watched a video of her at camp or some shit. But I deff see the meaning behind both videos. She’s so under rated.
WE WANT THE LAST MUSIC, IN THE END OF THIS VIDEO, WE NEED IT
I spotted jacob
The song is sweet and actually good but she made it distasteful with the stripping and twerking.
*twerking while manifesting*
U be heavy in my mind can u get the heck out !!!! And im worried i waisted the best of me on u 😢
These low budget ass women. Every video half naked, twerking and stripper poles. Come on sistas, is that all you got???
😍
I hear A Head Full of Dreams vibes here
Me​ : start​ therapy​ twerking
spiritually twerking
Sleepy twerking
The instrumental music reminds of opening music before Coldplay start their concert
Why am I in the comments and seeing everyone talking about twerking in different ways- like spiritually and quietly etc 😭 fr this music video is so magical
She reminds of Poison Ivy when she's dancing in the little hill
The message: She’s on psychedelics and wakes up in an alternate reality he sees the Essenes coming off of her (energy) . Therefore Good days ❤️.
For some reason, this reminds me of Avatar 💜🦋
I love this song and if you're here that means you must like it too. So I have a proposition...I'm looking for a music date. Let's share playlist. I'm looking forward to exploring new sounds, melodies and experiences with you! 😉☺️
My favorite song  my favorite singer
THIS IS ART! 🤌🏾 and I’m Living for it!
pov: almost every comment is ab twerking
I NEEEEEEED SHIRT SO BAD
This is what it looks like to be on crack lmao. I love her and this song, ima try to aquire this taste
The sulky jennifer causally exist because tempo nearly rinse after a addicted hourglass. agonizing, elated cuban
dear youtube algorythmn keep this song at the top of recommended daily listen for at least the next 10 years
This is on another level of amazing. ❤️🍄
Gives me Ice Moon vibes. Throw some glitter on that shit!
Who does this resonate with?? She vibrates on a different frequency. Definitely an artist!!
13,131,777 Views-- wow, I am blessed, healthy, wealthy and I watch this every time I'm having a bad day. The universe is working for me, not against me. I am loved. I am Love.
This video is definitely about drugs , not a relationship.
amo demais essa mulher, incrível demais parabéns por ser isso tudo p nos
This song is a BEAST
I....I just cannot wrap my mind around her beauty. I CANT!!!!
I just so love her
The way this song has seriously helped me so much emotionally is so crazy. I started just laying here crying because I felt so broken, begging god to take me because my anxiety and my depression feel like they have just simply won. This song really made me feel like good days are here and if they aren’t here that they are coming. This idea of it really is a good day if I let the pain and hurt go really pushed me to try to feel better , I started therapy and this is my first week starting my anti-depressants and anxiety medication. Thank you to myself for being alive because I am worth it. 🌱💕
Good days head

This is my life in a song.  This will remain in my mind rent free for the rest of my life ❤️
The voice is already amazing, those dance moves are too so impressive
Something about SZA reading a book while on the pole, thats so sexy to me...
the end thoooo 😫😫
I meditate to this.
If I was a song and music video... this would be it.
you know sza does psychedelics 😂
I love this song
always been a blessing
OHHHH MY GODDDD LMAOO I LOVE U SZA
Algum brasileiro aqui Plmdds?
I’d be the biggest simp 😔🙏🏿🙌🏿

i need a loop of 4:31 - 5:28
This is so fuckin lovely 💖✨

*swings hair aggressively*
Why I didn’t know she can dance tho 😳👏🏾👏🏾
😍😍
Miss Gurl please drop the album
When Sza starts singing NOBODY SPEAKS
I can’t figure out which one is actual self or projected self. Are we well read dancers or are we actually majestic fairy nymph trolls and Forrest goddesses, just completely wild.   Oh, I think I figured it out.
¿Quién viene por el tuit de Marc André ter Stegen?
id like to hear a sza song like this upbeat good stuff with some drill drums, just saying coz I'm working on a new project n heard some good stuff your sound engineer could maybe replicate, thumbs it up for her to see if you agree innit. Big fan, love n loyalty from the UK still. keep pushing sister
Ter stegen
Ter stegen sent you here
Thumbs if you're here because of Ter Stegen!
who came here after ter Stegen?
Why does this visuals reminded me of Merida from Brave?

Some P Valley inspiration

I am SO EXCITED FOR THE SHIRT SONG
i can't get over how beautiful this woman is
this is so nostalgic omfg
this song feels good to my soul ngl
I love how she represents that feral energetic sensual side is us a mushroom. It is like she is breaking free, and I just think its a great contrast to the slow and sultry side that women are expected to be in the media and how we have taken that power back. IDK that is my interpretation. <3
IN A ANT HILL SZA REALLY

She's such a damn tease, now I can't wait to hear the rest of that snippet at the end...
I really wanted to like this video but it just felt like a music video to showcase her ability to do modern dance....which is great and all, but in truth I was a left looking for more the entire video. I love SZA, but this visual was literally just okay, for me personally.... the dancing and wardrobe however, was nice to see though.

Tomorrow isn't promised give your life to Christ. Before it's too late. John 3:16 for God so love the world he gave his only son so whoever believes in him won't burn in hell but have everlasting life
She is a leftie

Didn’t expect the music video to be this in a positive way
deusa sim sim ou obvio?
This made me get into a good mood
It’s the shrooms aesthetic for me
Her videos never make any fking sense, but I always understand them for some reason.......
This gives me life
Yes yes and YES
Yes sza is trying to teach y'all, reach y'all.
I feel like this song connect with my sould. I know in some afterlife I wrote this.
I love Sza but she didn’t need to go pole dancing for this type song.
Shirt: Kiss me dangerous been so lost without you all around me get anxiuos, leave me don't look back it's all about you.  In the dark right now feeling lost but i like it comforting my sins and all about me, only got right now feeling days of representment, simmer in my skin.  It's all about blood stain in my shirt new bitch on my nerves, old nigga got curved, going back to my word, damn bitch you like thirty.

Sza! Nothing more nothing less...
Does someone knows the lyrics of the last parts when the music changes? I can't find them anywhere and i don't get them 😢
esse clipe não faz o menor sentido mas eu amei
This song is everything ❤
This resonated with me so hard. Total work of art
why’s the gas so expensive? ⛽️ 💰
This is like listening to Lofi but with a songtext! so calming
I’m listening at h&m store
I’m here after seeing ROŠE playlist
Genial
Does anyone know what's the lyrics on 4:47?   😀
*sad twerking*
1:27 me tryna take off my coat that’s 3 sizes to small
Very relaxing song make more related muscle video's👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Me​ : start​ therapy​ twerking
Madre de Dios 😂😂😂
When this next track dropping? That's a jam.
Fucks with this song Very smooth and chill 🔥🔥🔥
I usually don’t care for today’s music but this one got my attention...Beautiful tune
I literally love her pole dancing with all those books and one in hand. Something about it just is so beautiful
Looking for copper, I found Gold
I love this Lady. She a professor of magic.
Omg she’s soooooooo sexy and gorgeous!!! I love this video!! Sexy AF.......
I wish she would hurry and release the damn song already. I keep replaying the end of this video.
what's that next song? omg I feel so dumb haha
my comfort song 🥰
Esperei tanto por essa música! ❤️
The way my jaw dropped when I saw her on that pole. This video is magic.
My new motivation to workout💯
Get it boo
🔥🔥🔥🔥
How to describe aesthetic in a video.❤
nothing new.. boring
she said this one goes out to all my cottage core girls 😛
She really like pole dance I guess
That voice... love her
a whole shroom trip
Tbh I love the whole vibe and message of the video,she’s basically telling us that she’s feeling free to herself that she doesn’t follow others she the leader of herself. LOL I LOVE THIS MUSIC VID
Damn that last part tho! SO GOOD!!!
here to vibe💯
smash smash smash smash
Sza stop playing and make T-shirt a whole song
Did everyone know she’s really good at pole dancing?
Yusss queen makes me wana cry but happy
The Scorpio Queen!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦂
Once she rolled off of that hill it was on 😂😂
good days never bad days
this is so good when i eat pancakes
this shit hits hard
what"s the song at the end of the video called
It would be a good day today if you all would check out and show my first music video on my channel some love. I would really appreciate it, thank you!!!
One of the top songs on Belgian top 40! My fave song for this period! The video is amazing.... a beautiful melanated woman doing cool shit... dancing on the pole, reading books, looking amazing. I am now doing Intermittent Fasting because I want to be in shape. This song is an inspiration.
I never thought I could feel talent, so glad she decided to stay and share her gift!
not me watching this every morning to have a good day
She twerking like it’s a tribal dance or some spiritual dance 😂😂
Skill on the pole🔥🔥🔥
WHATS the Song @ the end called ?
I’m confused on what I just watched 😂
Here from TikTok
Ate every second of this!!!!
proud to say she is a part of the water sign gang
Took long enough. Love this song
i get flashbacks to a car ride in october where i had the unreleased snippet on repeat and it just adds to the vibe omg
listened to this ever since hit different mv came  out and damn this is the best
no one : sza : pole dancing in a library and then a gas station also sza : eating it up every single time <3
SZA YOU SAVED ME THANKS ❤️
Love this 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Gorgerous.
Honey please come out with this already 🥲
This like cool vibes like she ate it up left no crumbs she did good on this she need more subs
I think I got y’all- all the twerking and “throwing her back out” is chakra work. Twerking and wining are literally one of the greatest things you can do for your root and sacral chakra.  This all has a ton of symbolism of love goddesses and I’m here for it.
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲💪🏾
Remember when we all said she was basically Mother Earth in the flesh?   She really told us we were her children with this one.
This made me wanna go on a troom trip
SZA GODLIKE VOICE BROUGHT ME BACK HERE I LOVE YOU SZA
this definitelly wasn't the kind of video I was expecting after I heard the song first
I want to do shrooms bcs of this song
the gas station record though? FIRE.

I’m so ready for her to drop the song that’s at the end ong😩😩😩😩

I listen this song every morning to clear my mind
Plsss one collab with rosé!!!
every second of this official vid is literally eternal  ure a fucking queen !! ily
the way she expresses herself is just..... *ahhhhh* 💜pure frickin art
SZA is a chocolatey goddess in my eyes.
When the bonus song has a bonus song
I LOVE YOU LOVE YOU LOVE YOUR SONG PLS IM DYING🥺😭😭
The switch at 4:20
Half of us laying waste to our youth, it’s in the present. 🥺😢
TECHNOBLADE

SZA IS ART
2:43

SZA, minha filha, tô esperando até hoje esses dias bons que vc prometeu que viriam!!!
[Verse 1] Catch me, dangerous Been so lost without you all around me Getting anxious, leave me, darling Look like it's all about you  [Pre-Chorus] In the dark right now Feeling lost, but I like it Comforting my sins and all about me Only got right now Feeling tears of resentment Simmer in my skin It's all about  [Chorus] Blood stain on my shirt New bitch on my nerves Old nigga got curved Going back on my word Damn, bitch, you like thirty

That sneak peek at the end though 👀 Are we ever going to get brace yourself full version too 😭 lol someone trend it on tiktok pls
sza forever <3
👏👏🤍this is beautiful
Does anybody know if she talked about why she’s always dreaming in her videos? Like I love the hints of nostalgia, and spiritual vibrations but I still haven’t concluded what she’s trying to say
essa música é pft
Why aren't these types of videos censored? Promoting blatant drug use ,and promiscuity. I guess I'm not cool because I said that right?
❤❤
Sza in a mushroom garden is so iconic because if you really know Sza you know she loves doing shrooms 😂
CAN WE ALL APPRECIATE JACOB COLLIER AND HIS BRILLIANT MIND TOO?????
I am so ready for her new music.
여러분 다음 싱글 언제 나와요?
Sza.. you are simply amazing. Your creativity with your music and art in your visuals are ❤️💙💚👏🏾🙌🏾🥰. Damn girl.. I admire the Goddess in you.
4:31
Great moving song, Amazing body Sza
Me like 💚💜
Sza🤎🤎🤎
Women are just ✨ Praise all womenn
I love the song but the video has me super confused
not me crying because this song made me realize that i’m more than the abuse i’ve endured from my father my entire life, that i deserve the love and respect that i get.  Edit: thank you all so much for the wonderful things you’ve said! I wanted to update everyone on my life situation. I am proudly able to say that I am out of that toxic environment and working with domestic violence to get a place to live! This is amazing news! I could not have done it without the support I’ve received!
My mom and sister we're making fun of how she was dancing but I think it's beautiful 😍❤😍❤😍
Can anyone tell me what the other song she is singing in this? I can't figure it out!
What would be the name of the song if Sza & Ariana made one
Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They are either lonely. They are missing somebody, they are depressed, they are hurt, they are scarred from the past, they are having personal issues no one knows about, they have scared you wouldn't believe. They wish they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here read this word, and I am writing this for you so you don't feel alone anymore. Always remember, don't be depressed about the past and don't worry about the future, just focus on today. If todays not so great don't worry tomorrow's a new chance.  Have a nice day ❤
Love the vibe
Her variety is insane
I am surviving cancer. Healing from surgery last of 7 in the past 4 years. It has taken it toll and left it's scars. I am here. Healing. Your music helps.  Thank you so very much.

I aint never wanted a pole more in my entire life- that looked like so much fun
Sza could literally have every single person as a superfan and still be underrated somehow

Now THAT is a library where I can read.  Or would I ?
SZA’s voice legit turns me on.
lol Jacob creepin' on the TV
I love you sza
This song... I have no words 💘
Was on shrooms when I first heard this lmao
I'd like to renew my library card oh and disregard the stripper pole
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear, if you let me Feeling like (on your own) Feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby Heavy on my empty mind shit I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (my mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind) good days (good days on my mind) Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
The only mistake this song had was ending.
PERIODT I LOVE UUUU
ur so perfect and pretty
Shout out to sza for making amazing music and videos that don't match to the song or make sense at all
Whoever gave this a thumbs down can go to hell!
My doctor said I am lacking serotonin and dopamine so I started listening to SZA's voice daily and it's doing wonders.
The dry product synthetically bleach because faucet perceptually trace vice a tall card. damp, versed sailboat
The unknown case observationally fancy because mechanic genomically stroke since a naughty judo. worthless, unhealthy force
Girl why you rolling get up
if you dont like Sza, something is wrong with you
I really like this song it reminds me of when I broke through to another side and seen a garden it also reminds me of the chimpanzee fire that's in the Congos it's a type of fungus that glows in the dark and keeps the trees from choking on their own leaves wonderful wonderful wonderful song
you are such an inspiration solana 💛
this 00:38 feels like guts theme
Love you girl you're the bomb
Não vou na sua porque a minha vida não
HOW IS SHE REAL
Who hears JC?
No but who are the people who disliked this song??
Spell casting, nature worship, ancestral worship, witchcraft ain't something to play with. Spirits or familiars invoked or invited are not what they seem.
Sound like she's talking like reading the lyric... not singing..
4:24 omg

😍😍🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the days of resentment simmer on my skin part in the teaser has been stuck in my head forever. I cannot wait to hear the full song
how i dance in my bed when i am listening to music
Visually and her dancing is good, for some reason I never understand what she is singing about. Her singing is not my favorite and her phrasing is not the best.
MISS SZA LEFT NO CRUMBS PUR.
Wonder why she bleached her beautiful chocolate skin. She looks like Beyonce now. So sad.
I finally found masterpiece that I will watch forever.
Need that album in my life
Sza likes mushrooms 🍄😍😍😍
This is me right now. I feel like I wasted my best days trying to find someone to love when I could have just loved myself!
i cant wait for shirt
Can anyone tell me when the music that played at last is coming out?
Where all my Jacob Collier fans at?
So much detail in these sets!! Ugh I’m going to rewatch this like 1000 times
Smoke on highway vibes. Stl in the building
The amazing Jacob Collier at 2:29!!!
wait- the sneak peek at the end... yes.
Queen queen queen
THE OTHER SONG OMG
Beyonce + Bjork + a little extra cocoa= SZA in Good days video.
this mv is fucking healing me
This made me think of that viral tweet of the marching band young woman dancing on Fleetwood Mac.
Did she have to kill Me and then revive me with the bloodstained at the end?!?!
This song already gives me the feels....the video makes me emotional.
The Queen🔥♥️
I've whatch this eoo meny times I love it
Sad White Girl Music ( Playlist )
After seeing this and Doja Cats Streets Music Video maybe music videos in 2021 will be almost as good as the music in 2016
Very aesthetic and indie in the beginning
nice kamar sza muah
lets get this too 1mil sza cult and fans
My day is complete from the queen herself
ATE IT UPPPPP
AS YOU SHOULD BESTIE!!
Oh my goodness!!!! WOW! WOW!!!
4:31   Un-official lyrics:  Kiss me, Danger Been so lost without you a lot about me, Ka-ansas leave me to break a soul about you  Eat it doug right now,  Feeling lost but i like it Comfort and my sense is not about me; Only got right now Feeling tapes on freezanement (???) Sim on my skin all about-  Bloodstain on my shirt  new b*tch on my nerves old-       got curves Boom back to my work, Damn b*tch you’re like 30   edit: this is only a joke
It is literally creepy how many music videos I'm watching where the ppl are pretty much showing Spiritual possession and people still can't see this crap??! Drugs and lust... These are so played out, and people still falling for the traps...it's really really sad. I mean the song isn't even that good. So what if she's pretty, I'm over it..it's all the same
So gorgeous
Name the album alt plsssssss lol I would die happy. The the last one is dlt and you shut the world down
You need to drop the full audio of the song "Shirt" that's the name that the people of the tik tok gave, she's really very good and I'm all addicted to this song 😭

Saka
This song always makes me feel so important.
*downloads photoshop*   Sza: oooo barbie effects lets use it💅
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
Every thing a king wants to grow and build with such beautiful Nubian Queen
"half of us chasing fountains of youth and it's in the present"
Love this song <3
Summer walker and her soo gas 🔥🔥
I'm already looking forward to the release of the song from the end
to me it seems like she has a hard time removing herself from her bad days (the root she is stuck in) but beautifully embraces it and makes good days out of it by dancing, and eventually her changing positive mindset causes her to be released and she can dance freely & moves to the rythm of life cause she is life and life is her 🥺 so she embraces all the dark moments and equalizes them with good days idk but thats how i resonate with it
I'm here because of the Rosè's playllist
For me, it's a sneak peek at the next album.
I’ve  been ignoring this girl for way too long. She’s dope
Damn the snippet at the end sounds 🔥
I love how she takes this long hiatus and just comes back with absolute Vibranium
black girl magic  this is what they're really afraid of queens 👑
People r wierd and think stuff like this is good or beauty
her vibe is immaculate😩😩🤌🏾!!!
Yooooo sis... deep .. love it .......
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lmao I’m sorry but when she roll dat lil hill dat shit took me out😭😭😭
Was that astral projection or am I just way too high rn ?
Sza is 30 years old ?! 30 is not old but she looks a lot younger. From the body to the face straight up gorgeous.
So this is what its like to do shrooms gotcha!
napa gini si video clipnya hm
I wonder if she was on shrooms in this video?! I think it was mushrooms laying on the book in the beginning. I peeped😏
I'm surprised the indie kids didn't blow this up
most beautiful person ever
the end will probably be her next song
This instrumental makes me feel so peaceful 🥰
I love u sza u are so different
nobody is coming close to sza, she is on a level of her own
so beautiful
The best mantra existing in this world
This video reminds me of behind her eyes with the lucid dreaming and the Ora that’s on her. Also the  Norma Louise T-shirt, even tho the name is from a complete different show, Louise was a lead character in behind her eyes. The place she went when she dreamt was much like this video set and she fell asleep on a couch under open sky’s that sat on a grass...
O
omg do yall remember that one time i jumped in the ocean to save a baby dolphin from getting eaten by a shark??? 😩🙏

What crawls under her bed at 4:14?
So no one saw the demonic creature crawling at the end while she was laid out with the book? This vid has a lot of evil symbolism. People are so easily deceived by beauty and color. This is influencing young women in the worst way. Stay prayerful
am i the only one confused af
WE NEED A MELANIE X SZA COLLAB
Okay splits!!!!
Who else had the urge to try shrooms for the first time while watching this 🥴🥴🤣🤣
I’m mad she stole my choreography in the mystical forest scene🤣😂🤣
so we all just crying ?

Queen ❤️👑
I love the message of this video
Only me keep replying shirts ?

She really be passing those vibes through my ears huh? Ok girl
THE SONG SHOULD BE CALLED "Nerve"
CONFIRMED SZA IS A SMURF
11 year old me in the bathroom mirror at 2 am: 3:10
The fact that someone admitted to ignoring SZA... how could you?
ive watched this everyday since it dropped
What is the song at the end-
Tbh this mv is boring.. Too much repetition.. There are just 2 places in this mv scene
guys @ 0:28 - 0:33 pls help me what song that issa
So is this what she feels like when she’s on shrooms?
wow <3
that song at the end is definitely called “all about” or something 😭😭 not shirt wtf
love it here
wow
i want to do shrooms as well
I love u

That's Jacob Collier right?
High on magic shroom😂
as a SZA real fan i was waiting for a different thing NGL... but only for the fact  is the mf S Z A make it PURRRR
Still playing Ctrl and these 2 singles are blazing
Like the way she puts snippet at the end of every song, can’t wait for the next one
my bf made me a birthday edit to this song so whenever i hear it i cry. thank you for this masterpiece queen
Echoke😂
i absolutely love you so much
This made me feel soo good. Nothing but talent ❤
First time listening to this and it was magical 😭✨
As long as SZA gives us the beat and the vibes to every song
DAMMMMNNNN I LOVE YOUUU Thanks Queen for the new end song .... Vraiment on sait que sa continue laa la suite sil vous plait
@cartier3x on Instagram I follow back
I don’t understand this video. Am I missing something?
Makes me wanna go on a shroom trip. Such a vibeeeeee 🧚🏾🧚🏾
I think most can agree this song has gotten us through 2020-2021 so far
What is the second song ? Sza is too sexy!
My heart ❤️❤️
This song has been on literal repeat for months for me. This video is sexy as hell... but the vibe from the song was so different in my mind. I’m hella confused.
Beautiful girl right here🥺
Imma smack sza if she don’t drop “ shirt “
ONE OF THE HARDEST VISUALS THIS YEAR
I sing this all the time
The way she rolled down
I want to know who that guy on the tv was tho 👀
Is the song at the end called bloodstain or shirt?
The person who reads this will become successful one day!
i want this song on my funeral lmao
THE ENDING FUCK YES FINALLY ILY
She is sexy i think i feel in love
4:31🔥🔥
Okay  sza  I  see you queen!!!!!    I can tell she has been practicing  and now I have to start practicing on the pole for sure.
So, You're maybe also a shroom; nut what is about pole dancing in Your library? I understand, but fortunately I don't have to... ;-)) all in all really cute
I know 99% of people won't read this comment, but to the 1% have a blessed day.
If anyone is in constant pain everyday like me, I just want to remind you you are a warrior and we will get through this together ⚔️🛡️
❤️💯
Hi SZA, this is the first time i listen to your song and it is very good!!!!!
She so fine. Hey SZA

Girl that pole dancing is amazing girl you sleeping weight up collaborate with some big people your voice is amazing level up your music and your pole dancing make a man stand up sit up straight
Good song, Weird ass music video. There’s no storyline, much less any sense.. reading a book while on a stripper pole? Really? And wtf was she doing, having a seizure and calling it a dance.. this ain’t it
She looks like a sleeping angel
this just proves sza does psychedelic's
i’ve never felt gayer
I AM SO PROUD OF YOUUU <33
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Um dia quero ficar locona assim
she and khelani sounds so much alike. Good music.

você acaba com as minhas estruturas
Holy shit this music video is beautiful

Why all the dislikes??
E ela torna a nós deixar com um gostinho de quero mais
BRO I DIDN’T WANT “SHIRT” TO ENNDDD!!!

I don't have my "Good days" but listening to this song made me have a Good day :) I hope u have a good day to!
Jacob Collier being the sickest backing vocals here, love these guys
I just don't understand  her music at all. My daughter  loves her but I don't get it

Does sza know how to make a bad song?
Watch when your high :

i love this because it's literally what i look like dancing in my room during a yoga sesh. I also love the visualization of her aura as she practices her yoga<3
Do y’all know where the behind the scenes video for good days went?? Nobody is talking about where it went?!?!?!?! Wait what she reposted it then deleted it again?!?!???
Eu to surtando ela é perfeita 🥰❤️✊🏻
Wow!
Not me, who is in tears because I've discovered that I'm deserving and perfectly fine.
m u s h r o o m
Funny how i ended up here because of this being at the end of “hit different “ now i am here for the next song at the end 😭😩 THATS HOW U GET US EVERYTIME SIS♥️
Solana: So, SZA, which concepts do you want in this video? Do you want twerking around shrooms, pole dancing in the library or how about at a gas station? SZA: Yes.
Unpopular opinion but this video is cringey af . The song is ok . Nothing we haven't heard before.  All the themes in the video don't blend well at all . Who approved this? Top Dawg wya
She left no crumbs.
ON OUR CHANNEL THIS ONE IN REVERSE, ITS CRAZY🤯😵
SZA, please, please, PLEASE do a guest cameo on the next season of "P Valley" so I can get my entire life!😍😍😍
Thank you😭😭!!! I needed to know what she said at the end!! She said “damn bitch you like 30”
Been waiting on this😩💘💞
This is beyond words. Sza is slept on heavy. Beautiful woman beautiful artist. She is really growing too. I just became such a bigger fan.
she better call the song ‘thirty’ 🏃🏾‍♀️
😱😫🔥🔥😭
Love this song.but gyrating to  a song like this don’t. And sense 🤷🏿‍♂️

incredible
Someone please pass the blunt 🔥
this shit so powerfull
I’m obsessed with this song 💯 specifically her voice 😍 so calm and relax ❤️
This my favorite music video😫

I’ve never seen a better representation of what it’s like to take acid than those mushrooms moving

Like the video but the song isn't too my liking.
She even ended it with an acoustic of bloodstain❤
The best female artist out here👑queen take your crown
i come here everyday just to listen to the snippet of shirt at the end
The mv concept is like bjork went to club
Can we have a conversation about the flawless and sensual pole dancing
I love you SZA
IM SCREAMING THE ENDDDD OMGGGGG

Phenomenal
I love this! The scenes with mushrooms and moss just makes me feel refreshed!
She was having fun in this 😭😭
i love how the way she moves and dances doesn't conventionally make "sense"... she's just moving to the music and doing whatever feels right. completely carefree.
Wait sza can strip
the scene of sza reading a book while dancing pole lives rent free in my mind
Love ths video❤❤❤
I literally smiled through the whole video, aesthetically and phonically pleasing🌻

How I wish she can give the weekend a verse on this song, then they rock it till together till the end (remix)

Love this song so much, I have been listening at least twice a day, however I feel the video is a bit disjointed... I prefer the Lyrics one...
the dancing in the grass parts is kinda wired lol but i will now continue having a good day!
Sza ftw
She’s so pretty 😍
Queennn👑👑👑👑👑
Superbe !!
Her voice is so beautiful. It's like i can see the beauty of her voice....

Love this song and congrats for leaning some pole!  Dancing on the pole is much harder than it looks!!
Sometimes you just have to thank God for certain people and she is one of them. Authentically herself and just an amazing spirit. God bless her and protect her precious soul, such a gem to the world.

This song reminds me of he first 2 album and I'm in love

4:30
For everyone coming back to that end scene, it starts here 4:25
Beautiful video
EVERYBODY SAYS HUMANS CANT BE PERFECT OK SZA IS NOT A HUMAN WE ALL KNOW THAT
Why do girls always sexualize themselves like this in music videos? Then please don't expect people not to be creeps, cause it's an invitation.
“cottagecore”

You probably won't be seeing this but I want you to know, Never Give Up on something you are passionate about. I hope I made your day <3

4:20 👁
Yasss! Givin' us BODY!
Hollywood is disgusting they know that first scene look like bestiality it look like that dog was giving her oral  it was portrayed like that for a reason
Did Parris Goebel choreograph some of the piece?
Sza you better drop this jam please!🥺☹️
If Mother Nature was a person
🥺
Pleaseee start calling it bloodstain again😩😩😩.
A strong independent muslim woman on the pole hit different.
My face was like 🤩🤩🤩🤩

This is not an r&b song but pop bliss, I love it
Damn gas is high! Now that must be hell!
I must be in the best dream ever Sza,and a room full of books!
❤️
Never passed out from shrooms . My mind wouldn't let me . It's more like The Simpson's Hot Chili Peppers episode . The rolling of the earth . Do recommended . Very nice music video .

Garbo, she became a mumble rapper, ain't understand a word she said
The way she rolled down the hill tho 😭😭😭

Is she a worm ?
We weren’t ready for this 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵

ARTISTAAAAAA PERFEITA ❤️
Rachael approved
YUPPP
WE WANT BLOODSTAINS
Doja a spider and sza is just a-🤦🏿‍♀️
I swear people come on videos and try to interpret it to be so deep LOL!! Fine...what's the symbolism of the Chevron gas station LOL!
This video is captivating for sure 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
I stopped on 3:13 my Bday and I’ve been on my toes since she got on this pole!!! I’m gone be  here for a awhile trying to execute these moves like she did!
U are god
She sounds like young keisha cole
zooted?😭
Pov: you ate a hallucinating mushroom in a strip club
the power she holds
Does anyone else get a huge boost of serotonin as soon as the beat gets louder?
*i like how none of us gonna talk about how she's still single*
Sza is literally the forest fairy of this generation 😍🖤
Babyyyyy I’m so in love with her oh my god she’s breathtaking
...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                  Romans 10:9 Just believe that Jesus died for you to save you from your sins.  That's it.
eu te amo sza !!!
AND THEY SAY FARIES AREN'T REAL......
2:19
Them MUSHROOMS 🍄 BE HITTING 🤫
The beginning feels like a clog lol
The feeling of listening to a Sza track for the first time is unrivaled by every addictive substance in the world
SZA!!!!!😩😍😍😍😍
this is giving me umi vibes
Beautiful:)
Sza really said let me join Mario & Luigi 🍄😅👁👄👁
OOH babe
She so Damn pretty no cap 😍💕💕😍😍
omggggg goddesttttt
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
I need whatever that is at the end. ASAP
te amo
When i heard this on shrooms it was WILD the connection and everything is so perfect
This song and video is so addictive.🤯
I was so shooked the first time I watched and listened to this I was surprised that “shirt” started playing at the end
I’m so happy there’s new sza music 🥺
She is glowing 😍
She’s like Poison Ivy
I can’t understand half of what she’s saying but the video is absolutely amazing
Those guitar chords sound so beautiful and nostalgic, just for that I already love the song.
$4.39 for gas!! 🥴
☺️
Szaaa why u gotta be do good for !! ??!!!
Can someone explain the message of this video to me? I’m a bit slow haha.
Am i the only one who think she is the woman version of Simba cuz she's roaring like a true lion.
Am i the only one who think she is the woman version of Simba cuz she's roaring like a true lion.
Having fun isn’t hard if you got a library card 📚
Can I just say that the time the next video starts is 4:20 😆 you know SZA did that on purpose❤️ I love her
Stop stereotyping strippers. They’re extremely smart 🧠 .  I bet y’all didn’t catch that symbolism. There’s a few. 🥰😘👑
Watching this was the first time I actually listened to the lyrics instead of just vibing and woah
Thinking about how people are going to praise SZA endlessly for this pole dancing scene & then still give Lana shit 👀
good day in my mind can u take a step out get enot get ur edot tspis heavy in my mind can u get the hell out
I'm sorry but if you don't hat high as a kite while listening to this song are you even living
visual art at its finest 🖤
YASSSS
Okayyyy Solána Imani Rowe you killed this‼️‼️
Everything is so over-sexualized. We are so desensitized to it all. What happened to just the gifts and talents being the show?
She’s like the Beyoncé for people that are woke.
yall talking abt the music vid but THE ENDDDD PURRR
I need the ending song immediately
Hear me out... medieval times, Sza, aggresive twerks, can't get better. Thou shall twerketh
She is literally AMAZING if she ever stops singing atleast she got being a bomb as stripper to fall back on
No I am not just here for the last part I love the whole video and the whole song including the last <3
I love her bro 😭😭😭😭✨😍😍
Shirt starts at 4:30 ur welcome 😉
FIRE LOVE HER WHO KNEW SHE CAN POLE DANCE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GREAT
such a masterpiece babe, u transmit really nice vibes
Damn shawty okay
When her album come out?
Unique voice 👌 😍
Is it just me seeing if the numbers on the gas pump mean anything???
This is talent 🥵
Her flexibility though❤❤.
My God the way how she swang on that pole on 3:04 🥺🥴😍 she can take my soul any day 😫
Come on Black Poison Ivy👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Man, I see a social media trying to clown sza from one little clip like this whole video not a f**king vibe! I’m glad I watched this in it’s entirety. I adore sza artistry, she such a unique beautiful talent. I love everything about this video <3
Our ancestors didn't go to church to praise God, they danced to praise the spirits. That's why black people love to dance and nowadays, we reproduce the same dances without knowing their meaning. Some of us still have that knowledge.
2:21
go off
So at the end is that a teaser or is it actually apart of the song Bc if so that song is gonna blow up then it already is
This video version hits different...and not in a good way... Sorry Solana
Her spirit was elevating !!😍😍😫😫😫
i wanna be just like sza. creative and successful
question why did good days play at the end of hit different
AHH IVE BEEN WAITING AHAHAHAHA
So smooth
LMAOOO THSI IS NOT A TWERKING SONG......

The last bit needs to be a song asap🙌🏼👏🏽
When wkll she release shirt
ok but when is the song at the end releasing cause i've replayed the ending 100 times and I know the lyrics ..😂
Sza holds so much power 😩😍😍🤩!!
Pero que mujer 🥵
This is a vibe
Idk. I don’t like it. I lowkey cringed most of it.
The really went hard on them dance moves 😭
Is she supposed to be astral projecting and were in her astral realm
I SCREAMED SO HARD AT FIRST, AND AT THE END TOO !??!?!?!
The way she doing them tricks on that pole 👀
6 days with 6.7 million views. sza deff has the most dedicated fanbase imo
Pronto agora meu sonho é dançar pole dance em uma sala cheia de livros🙂✌

THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL DAMN😭😭
I think I understand why my Husband likes Sza.
im so sad
Im tired of SZA given us these snippets like c mon now sis
PERFECT WOMAN  🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
If y’all didn’t know she tripping of shroms
love this song but when she spun her neck I lost it
This is how I dance in my kitchen ( not nearly this good tho)
why was some of the choreo so agressive?
I LOVE IT
🔥
Last part woow
Are you a puffball mushroom
I don’t know who broke up with Sza... but what the hell was they thinking
I’m so confused ,When she jumping like that ,was she releasing spirits!?
Whats the ending song??
PURRRR MISS MAMAS
Yessssss periodttttt 😍😍🥰🥰
So fab omg
Healing voice and music 😌
I don't have the experience to say if the song is good or not but i personally didn't like it. The video clip is crazy tho, i loved it
"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully." — 1 Timothy 5:14 KJV
Now all we need is "shirt" from tiktok cuz whewww😍😍😍😍
The amount of times I’ve come back to listen to the preview of the next song-
I love the video because I honor what the song felt like to Sza which may be why she chose this concept. I guess shaderoom likes it when everyone's video looks the same. Not every female wants to use a Meg or Cardi video set up. Sza showed them what THAT BODY and that VOICE can do. Now they mad.
ive replayed the ending at least 10 times now
Turks are here :)
when i heard shirt start playing i started levitating
She’s going to lead us thru hot girl summer 2021
Bro she’s doing the most 🤣🤣🤣🤣the twerking scene took me tf out , this is not a twerking song
Awesome directing
GOOD DAYYSYSYSYSYS
visual representation of how i feel when i listen to this song
The little dance she did had me dead but I liked it
But what is she saying...?
this song feels like free therapy ✨
I love it 🥰 thats Scorpio magick babyyyyyyy ♏🍄
Nice
Her body so goals
Please I love this sm 😭😭
Love it
OKAY SZA DEMOLISHED VOCALLY AND GRAPHICALLY!!!! BUT WHO ELSE WAITING ON THE CLOSER TOO 🤔
fr can’t stop listening to it 🥰😭
Black women: The only flowers that grow unwatered. I love y’all 🥺❤️❤️❤️
First this one, then Streets and now Telepatía
Frfr I can listen to this song and watch this video all day
SEXY ASS ART RIGHT HERE!!!!
That next song gonna be so fucking crazy 🔥
One should not watch while stoned
god damn this womannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
She is a literal Goddess 💫💚
Is she allright ?
I think I'm overthinking it but the old computer is a reference to ctrl
queeeeen
Love this, especially the ending 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok but how can someone not like this? Those people are blind and do not have ears
Loving the video! The scene with pole in the library...LOVE IT!!!!!
PERIODT JUST KEEP GOING
worm tingz 😭😭😍😍🙄🙄🙄😫😫
Love Sza music
GOOSEBUMPS
I love the pole dancing and books, the symbolism of being sexy and intelligent at the same time is beautiful
okay miss everything
i love how symbolic the video is through dance, from her letting go in the forest of finally accepting her past and letting for the future, while also showcasing the beauty in pole dance, there's so many gems if you just take a moment to look at them
this reminded me of mark nct btw this song deserve awards please give her
THE WAY THAT IM SPEACHLESS
I've Played this song like 50 times.. Damn she is so infectious like her body of work.
4:31
4:30
This video isssss sooo lit like hooow
THISSS SONGG WASSS SOOO AGHHH I CANT TALK RN IM DOING SZA VIBES
*Beautiful musical melody. So refreshing and relaxing, friend with you, just like your video style! Excellent😍👌*
Silly Video
She high or somtn?
HOW TEACH ME YOUR WAYSSS
Funny how i ended up here because of this being at the end of “hit different “ now i am here for the next song at the end 😭😩 THATS HOW U GET US EVERYTIME SIS♥️
Periodttt
Wow..that put me in a motivational mood..i love it..gosh weirdly amazing!!
*Sza in wonderland* 😍
the forest!!! the library!!! the pages all over the pole base!!! the NEW SONG !!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHHHHHHGHH
SZA bringing in the artist vibes!😤😻 "Hit different' def had better cinematography and set design. This one was creative and very symbolic with the environmental landscape and library scenes mixed with dance. The contrast of the dance against this design set was quite interesting. While the fellows are looking fwd to the pole dancing in the continuing 'Chronicles of Love Frustration', i say "I see you, SZA, striving to take yr artistry to the next level with yr talented team."🎨🤸🤹
This is just not good
She'e so pretty
Such a beautiful song, BUT compared to the Hit Different music video, this is weak, if not bordering on lazy and uncreative!!! I could have did a better job for you. Not sure who's on your team girl and told you this ok? But nvm, next😑
1:28 somebody tell me pls what kind of effect is that !
I just how she cliff hangs us, it’s like drop the song mamas😫😫
i can't take this one seriously especially when she forced herself to tumble down the hill coz of tiktok,😭😭😭 still lookin stunning in all ways tho 😭😭
YES MAAAAAAAMMMM
This whole video was most definitely a vibe and much needed  I love you sza 🦄🦋🍄
oddest movments but im here for the vibe like ughhh
lol what a quirky video.
The pole and the Books are just sending me. I love it
It's giving me carefree. #Embodying2021 Also: This production 🔥 Sza 🔥 "Half of us chasing youth / And it's in the present, Now" 🎯 All of it 🏆👏🏾 #Excellence
Omg.  You are the definition of Sexy🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️
She's a Real Vibe .
I wanna hug her so much 😢
Esse clip me deu gatilho de aulas de pole dance ,aaa
Eu tô muito viciadooo, vsfddd
So good as always👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

I am soo surprised no one seems to be comparing her aesthetic to Princess Selenia from Arthur and the Invisibles. Such a cool art direction and song!
🤎
So beautiful and brave. I do not know much about this singer, what are their preferred pronouns?
beautiful
I’ve  been ignoring this girl for way too long. She’s dope
She missed the nozzle
Damn, now I really want to chill on some moss
y'all see the Jacob cameo in da tv... :0
This is so boring. And why do u all strip in every song. Is this supposed to be cool?
Does anyone else turn the phone upside down when she’s upside down on the pole?
I’m a simple person, I see mushrooms, I click
Next part of the song starts at 4:20!
Wow she's such a beauty
Im a little confused but... happy
I’m offended 😭 I’m 37 & I love Sza  if idk bout this next song.

Cade os brasileiros ouvindo esse hino? #LoveUSza #SzaBrazil
It’s EVERYTHING for me
I can't wait for the album, that teaser at the end was as intriguing as the good days teaser at the end of Hit Different
It's so crazy because the day this song was released, I was in the bedroom of my parent's home, sick from covid, and just sobbing to this song from the first listen. but I knew good days were coming. And now I'm watching this in a whole new environment, with some mushrooms sitting near me, and I can say that good days are near and will continue to come. thank u SZA
Tiktok:yep.thats mine now
Yeah mom, studying. At the library…
I heard this one day going to work an fell in love with it been listening ever since..
banana tree
*sad twerking*

Ms.Sza could you kindly..um 👉🏾👈🏾drop that song at the end...please
4:31   Un-official lyrics:  Kiss me, Danger Been so lost without you a lot about me, Ka-ansas leave me to break a soul about you  Eat it doug right now,  Feeling lost but i like it Comfort and my sense is not about me; Only got right now Feeling tapes on freezanement (???) Sim on my skin all about-  Bloodstain on my shirt  new b*tch on my nerves old-       got curves Boom back to my work, Damn b*tch you’re like 30   edit: this is only a joke

https://youtu.be/U-ZT6Dj9MkA
She really started performing and exorcism
these “youtube dislike bots” really need to go away
She deffo took shrooms before this <3
4:26 is that a different song all together?
GOD'S VOICE!
She Gave Madd Contemporary Vibes ... okurrrr
I’m confused 🤷🏿‍♀️ what is she saying?
Yessss 🔥🔥🔥
OMG THE END
the ending tho !
i’m obsessed w her orange hair. i just am😭😭
where are  this songs 1B views...... the world is unfair
Elegance
💯🤍😍
The part when she’s on the pole is my favorite.
Perioddd
Ethereal.
SZA NEVER DISAPPOINT 😩❤️🗣👏🏽.
this is what ivebeenwaiting for
Bro Sza's real name is so beautiful..I think I might name my future daughter that
ngl I want some jelly and bread
The part where she’s past out. I believe that it isn’t shrooms. I believe it was symbolism of shifting. she was scripting her desired reality. Because when they show her body you’ll notice a notepad beside her which she could’ve been scripting in. Then after they show the angel numbers 999. Plus you could see the shadow from her desired reality floating back into her current reality
those shrooms must of been good asf 🥵
Yes sis show those gymnastic skills 👑❤️
weird. but I like it.
To the people who didn't like this video wasn't having a good say
SZA i love you and all but you doing the most
😍😍😍
The video is so weird but I love the song.
Now she definitely needs to post shirt 😩❗💕

For everyone worrying about your future and plans, here’s a quick verse - “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah 29:11 💫 Don’t give up on God, cause he won’t give up on you. He is working in so many different ways. Don’t forget that you are loved and Jesus is coming soon❤️
I’m in love
I don't know if it's just me.. But the song just ended like an awkward way.. the end part was when we like feel the vibe but it just ended like that... She could have made it longer... like I was dancing like a toad on the end part but it just ended..like what????

Sza is one of the few females out right now that don't sounds like a thot, stripper or a call girl telling their life story. Her sings has more creativity and substance to them.

🛐🛐🛐❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
those parallells of Her - a part of the nature - freely dancing in nature and connecting to her primality, and then those moves being mirrored while she's on the pole. being on the pole while studying at the same time... man i can connect to that
✨Sza wonderland ✨
Hey you! God loves you a lot!  “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭@‬ ‭ “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭5:8‬ ‭ “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” ‭‭John‬ ‭@-17‬ ‭ “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬ ‭ “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭@‬ ‭ Hell is real, death is certain. But you can have your free ticket ready to go to heaven today.  Have a great day! God loves you!

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit  I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me  All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind  Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear, if you let me Feeling like (on your own) Feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby Heavy on my empty mind shit  I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (my mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me  All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind) good days (good days on my mind) Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind  Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now  Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind  Kiss me, dangerous Been so lost without you all around me Getting anxious Leave me, don't look back, it's all about you  In the dark right now Feeling lost, but I like it Comforting my sins and all about me Only got right now Feeling tears of resentment Simmer in my skin It's all about  Blood stain on my shirt New bitch on my nerves Old nigga got curved Going back on my word Damn, bitch, you like thirty
God (Jesus Christ) loves you dearly, He saved my life and I could have died but He had mercy on my soul to forgive and take good care of me. I never had a father and He is teaching me what that feels like.   When no one was there for me,  when I was battling depression and feeling unloved He showed me what it feels like to be truly loved by someone. It were times were He was very bold with me and told me to stop doing something and Ik He did it bc He wants to look out for me. My mother died and my big brother passed away.   My family rejects Christ and I hate to see them reject so great of a God. Jesus showed me He is God Almighty and real He loves you for real even if it seems like He hates you or errbody thats a lie bc the devil wants you to lose what God is offering bc he lost and is getting casted in the lake of fire. God is no joke and He plays no games He wishes none to burn but come to Him and repent.   We can't say we love God and hate Him with our deeds. If you need anything He is there but WE have to ask without doubting Him, in need and in truth.    Repent of your sins and cry out for Jesus He is coming back with great wrath with a sword apon Him. Much love💛🌮
I had no idea she was that fine!! And skills Galore 😜😍
AHHH YESSS PREVIEW OF THE NEXT SONGGG😩😩💕
So all in a week sza and doja decided to kill the ENTIRE FUCKIN GAME LIKE THIS??

Love this! The mushroom garden is giving me Mario Brothers nostalgia.
Plzzz I love this women
Lemme find out sza was a stripper back in the day because sis working that damn pole
I’m way to addicted to this song it’s unhealthy🧍🏽‍♀️
She cleaned the grill, the tongs, then went inside did the WHOLE damn kitchen and I'm still over here starving after that "Shirt" outro
Perfeita!!!!!
I feel like this is a R&b version of Green Tea Peng and FKA Twigs. It's like telling someone that sunny D is orange juice?
I cannot believe sza invented cottagecore
real fairy vibes
i am so excited rn
What happened to the Behind the Scenes video?!? 🥺🥺💔
this was.. wow. them gas prices were expensive dont manifest that lol. and the pole. THE POLE!!

Stripping is the norm today you can’t read a book or go outside in the summer time without acting and looking like a stripper. “Sign of the times” Revelation 21:8
*Casually pulldancing and reading a book*
why does she give me melenie martinez vibes ❤️❤️
"my cat died today"

Love the song, video could’ve been better though
Honestly I love SZA and all her songs but what is she doing-
Shirt ‘ i çıkartsan mı artık!!!!!

Unfuckwitable. 😘
YASSSS QUEEN AS U SHOULD
Very talented and very beautiful!
Solanaaaaaaa 🥺😭😩
Anyone else thinking she may have gotten the pole dancing inspiration from Twigs? Played a major part in her Magdalene album and at her live shows.
The excess dancing of where she wears the leaf-like pants doesn't go with the vibe of this song but the pole dancing fits the vibe more....just stating my opinion
no words for this masterpiece, but thank you so much sza <3
Oh wow 🤩
Old nigga got curved. Going back on my words.....I feel that!!
Imagine how many people are listening to this with you right now.
Thanks expressive
Aşkı tattığım bu günlerde sana çok teşekkür ederim, bu şarkı bugüne yakışır mı şimdi seni düşünerek keşfediyorum. Seni uzaktan sevmek de güzel şimdilik, hayatıma gelmeni tatlı bir sabırsızlıkla, telaşla bekliyorum... 10.03.21
telling my kids this is Aphrodite
Omg ate and left no crumbs
bloodshirt on my shirt
all i can say is WWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
The fact that this song is about psychedelics and their power on the mind is just dope.
This song helps tremendously with my severe depression & anxiety. Thanks SZA 🌻✨💫❤️
ngl pole dancing looks like so much fun when she does it
Have you ever listened a song, imagined what it would look like as a music video and then when you finally see the video it's COMPLETELY different what you imagined?   This video is exactly like that.    And this is not a compliment.
Period ❣️
intellectual twerking
Increíble 💚🤎🤍
Perfect!! damn girl love uuu
Amazing <3
I Did Not Know SZA is a Dancer. 💋
Wait the overgrown mossy computer made me think of the computer on the cover of Ctrl
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
Black women are ART. period 😍🔥
SZA is a fucking queen
art.
4:44
I don’t completely understand it but I love it 🥰
Love the video....great body!
Here before 1M
This music is so angelic

JUST THE BEGGINING AND THE THUMBNAIL MADE ME WANA WATCH THIS AAAAA ITS AMAZING X!!!
I just realized that she supposed to be tripping 🤯🤦🏾‍♀️
I LITERALLY CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW SONG SHE SHOWED AT THE END OMGGG
STUNNING
The fact that the song ended at 4:20 got me like 🤯
I love 💕 her, so authentic

Omg the song at the end is Shirt 😶 I'm so excited 😭😭❤️❤️
Ex watches video hypnotize..    while I cry understanding her vibe and words....   crazy dayz.
4 songs in 1
The best video I’ve seen in years! Such a passionate and creative performer, artist, human. Award worthy!
“Damn bitch you like 30” I felt that in my soul.
Ima watch dis on my next trip
UHM... QUEEN!!!
She high on mushrooms?
This is one of the songs you’ll hear in the car 5 years later just jamming out.
SOLONA PLEASE-
I love this so much
The nature set, costume, and choreography reminds me of the ballet Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.
If only I was the pole🧐
Ctrl changed my life
DROP NEXT PLSSSS 💚
when she rolled down the hill-
Idk who left crumbs but it certainly was not her 🤷‍♀️
this kinda music videos is everythinnggg to me i love it so much
Love this video her dance moves are amazing she's giving me normani vibes as far as the dancing sza is beautiful!
She’s a whole aesthetic
I got chills on my forehead
in LOVE with the visuals. I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT SO MUCH
I tried to give this 5+ thumbs up but it won't let me. How do I let thumbs up know SZA deserves this and much more?

She does it every time.
Everything about this is just...beautiful and nature loving 😌✨
I have no words🔥🔥🔥
Her voice always speaks with my soul 😭
What a trip feels like
Come on Bloodstain!!!! I need that!!
I can't be the only one who also imagined her dancing in a magical forest for this music video...
Okay so the pole dancing is distracting everyone while all she’s morphing then doing a ritual dance in a false world with a white glow of spirits surrounding her with a man shaking his head yes until she’s done.... BUT ALL WE’RE SUPPOSED TO SEE IS HER DANCING ON A POLE LOL 😂 y’all so blind it’s sick but ok I still like her music but don’t forget who she’s working for as a Mâttâ fact look up the real definition of  “CELEBRITY”  Sacrificial
She’s 🔥fire and Ice 🧊.. her voice is so soothing
ATE
Alice in wonderland vibes
her and Naiya K'Nai and Chole x Halle all have a unique sound
QUEEN ♥️
The aggressive twerking and dancing was a little off putting for such a chill song
how does Sza only have 2mil subscribers!? literally any1 who doesn’t live under a rock listens to her
THE BACKGROUND MUSIC SCREAMS NATURE
The black woman is God in the flesh.
Solana ate!
I'v got a genuine question, if black women/men are allowed to say the n word, why aren't white people allowed as well?
gosh shes gorgeous....

I really wanted to see more balance been work the stripper pole will do🔥👀🤣
I was worried SZA would get whiplash from all those head flips
SZA IS MY QUEEN. DID I STUTTER?
all the sza bandwagons out here acting like they day 1 lol
Sza should've put the Legless Stripper in her Video. Lol 😆😆😆😆
Vim pra dar uma moral!
SZA never fails to impress 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
omg noah miller should recreate this🙄🤚
A MYSICA NO FINAL MMEUFUEHDHBX. MULHER LANCA LOGO ESSE NEGOCIO TA TODOMUNDO IMPLORANDO
NEVER TAKE ANY COVID 19 VACCINE. THIS IS A PLANDEMIC FOR ECONOMIC RESET.  BE MINDFUL OF THIS BEING THE VACCINE. THIS IS A LOVING ADMONISHMENT. THIS VACCINE IS TO COME HAS DNA CHANGES CAPABILITIES, LUCIFERASE, AND NANOTECHNOLOGY. THIS VACCINE IS A BAND AID.  SO THEREFORE IT IS NOT MIS-INFORMATION.  THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
So is this what taking shrooms feels like? If it is i'm in.
What's the song in the end??????
Sza, ur queen now✋🏼😔
MEUFUES Q MULHER LINDA DO CARAKHO

Both songs fire😍🔥
Sza is a goddes
2:21 jack and jill :
been in love with her sinces 17.
And once again her preview and the end for the next song is 🔥. SZA is 3/3
she went awfffffff🥺😍❤️
I feel like I'm high watching mother nature do her thing on the world
I swear she's amazing. Not one bad song, directs her own videos and can dance. Go off 🔥
The part when she rolled down gagged me 😂😂
SZA look like war goddess
Ethereal. I’ve died and gone to heaven 😍
4:47 to 4:54 where she is twirling on the pole hair flying is so mesmerizing...
QUEENNNNN
sza is just perfect
3:13 me in front of the mirror every 10 mins
It's the fact that every down beat is a new dance movement in the "shirt" part 😭🤯💜💜
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile I still wanna try, still believe in Good days 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤hanging on 🖤
Sza pole dancing on library is whole another vibe
Anyone else makes then want to fly?
Perfeição de mulher 😍
SZA WHERE IS THE GOOD DAYS I STILL CAN’T FIND THEM
I’m sorry what SZA? That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my entire 20 years of life! Goosebumps all over! LEFT NO CRUMBS 👌🏻
This video was filmed in mother natures home
Not bad
I think im in love 🥰
She reminds me of the little fairy in fern gully
The vibration of this sound is so freeing. The instrumentals are way too fire jeezzz ♡
Bendiciones 🙏❤️🇨🇺
Bravo pour votre travail et votre professionnalisme 🙏❤️🇨🇺🎶💯
Art
SZA Brings out the Fairy 🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️ in me 💕
AHH!! This reading just started and it is already spot on - my birthday is April 13th!! 13 is my lucky number for obvious reasons ;) ANNND I just started painting again after a 13 year stagnancy! WOW. Thank you, Dee!!!!
This shit makes NO sense in retrospect or conceptually. What a waste of film.
Yes ma’am !!
SZA got us living off snippets 😭
PERIOD YESSS
In 4:30 begins another song or what happens? Because if it is I want to listen the whole song, sounds amazing
Great video but I know gas ain’t costing damn near 5 dollars over there😭
That’s means the next song
I thought she retired. If not- yay
Such a TEASE with these samples at the end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ugh i just can't wait for the new album.
Was she a stripper fr?
i love you
P Valley!! Very talented at every thingd she does. Keep up the work.
2:20
No one is talking about the symbolization of her pole dancing while reading a book? She is breaking the narrative that all strippers/pole dancers are uneducated
this is everything! can we just talk about how she incorporated that healing bowl sound in there?? girl yes! she says hi i'm on the road to spiritual evolution, and im bringing you too! we absolutely love to see it <3
I come here most time to watch from 4:30 till the end a bunch of times
too wonderful 🤤
i have the urge to cry watching this idk its so beautiful
Esssa música é tão gostosinha de ouvir aaaaa
A fucking queen 😍😍
For some reason the "puti mama" or at least that's what it sounds like is so annoying.
this takes cottagecore to a new level
🤍🤍
Expected waaayy more than the pole for this video... but disappointed
YES YES YES YES
I pray to sza
Now I'm wondering if other book keepers also do pole dancing when they're alone in the library, lmao.
i love this song sm
The beginning of the song giving me Frank ocean vibes 😍😍😍
o bait da próxima música no fim do clipe a mente dela caras...
This song a Whole mood🎶💜
*twerks on mushroom*
and the category is BODY 😍😍😅
*Twerks in fairy*
Soooooooo, I really need the album sis... pretty please!
She’s also showing ladies and gentlemen that it is sexy to read! Everybody want somebody that can add to their own library(thoughts).. Reading is fundamental on all levels! Educate yourselves... Peace!
SZA is soo pretty🥺
Good voice same same Miley Cyrus but feeling in singing not yet all
I fuckin love this song!!!
The way she just controlled my eyes for 5:33 don’t make no sense at all but I love it here 😂
I know most of the girls were strippers before the come up, but was Ms SZA a stripper ?? Cuz !! She did that and some ❤️
The end was like:🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I’ve read lots of comments and see none about the whole 🍄trip and symbolism. She herself was giving off spores just like a 🍄 and the lyrics in the second verse give me chills every time. 🧘🏾‍♀️✨💫
isnt it funny to think people who view youtube videos to hate on them, literally make the people they’re hating on money by viewing it? ive always adored that. like yeah you can come and leave negativity but thanks for the check boo! (((:
SZAs voice makes me feel like everything is okay. Love the song.
mae-channnnn

Yasss the preview at the end for the next song just how she did with good days on hit different
1:15 That one spoon that got stuck in the garbage disposal
Unpopular opinion: underwhelming
why did the best songs come during pandemic ???? #obsessed
the plot twist at the end lol omg yes queen
i love how i felt like i just saw 5 different videos
SZA is the finest female I swear
idk what her mean when she did the twerk
SZA never misses much love from UG
every music video made by sza is a masterpiece 💓💓
We’ve had enough this year ❤️❤️👏
anybody getting camila's vibes?
SZA is ethereal.
am i the only one who feels as if the music vid doesn’t match the song which i love
Love her hair. What kind of hair is that
just imagine watching this high af I know
I thought it’s the dust when she start spinning her neck
❤❤❤❤
She's amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZAuADGL5-o
SZA said what if i give the cottagecore and dark academia lesbians what they want
my gf pmo
From now on, that’s how I’ll be reading my books... Might as well present my seminar like this...  I’ll be damned if I don’t get an A+
2:07 Me: double checking I still got my library card
This whole video is giving praise dancer🤣
Just a goddess that's all i can say
😍😍😍
I want her to make merch so I can buy some of it
🎧🎼👍🏾🇰🇪
the flex
Congratulations to Solana and her team for the achievement. These little films are punchy and "well edited" in a way that is inversely proportional to the music and the lyrics, who's are flatness that nothing comes close to.
The most astethic music ever
When is this new album coming?????
4:25
WE STANNNNNNN SZZAAAAAAAAAA I WAS WAITING ON THE ENDING NOBODY: ME: BOOLD STAIN ON MY SHIRT
I just want to hear more of the song that plays at the end...but I can't find it on Apple Music 😭
3:18
I wonder at the significance of the library and mushroom set? Like, obviously, she took shrooms and is going on a trip and envisioning herself in a little mushroom kingdom. I just think its interesting that both sets look like something out of a kids tv show that you would've seen in the mid to late 90's, ESPECIALLY that library set which gave me some serious Between The Lions/reading show for kids that were super popular during that time. And in the middle of all that is her. It's magical to see her as she is, a beautiful woman in all of her power and femininity, juxtaposing herself against what looks like things that could've been from her childhood. Then the song itself is a meditation on growing and developing as a person while looking for that soundness of mind -- accepting that chasing that feeling of youth or being young is pointless, especially when it's always going to be in your present. You as you are. SZA as she is. Those dances lend to that message by looking both graceful, freeing, and spontaneous. Was mesmerized!
Release an album so I can buy it .
thanks to bretman rock  am in love with this song🙌🙌😌
Sza Ate that she betta her glow babbbbyy ✨
DANG said a 58 year old woman. MASSIVE Props. DA BOMB BA

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good…
I had a stroke when I heard the iconic unreleased song 😪
True artist 🧑‍🎨
DEEP, TOO DEEP.
Congratulations your taste in music is top notch 👌
Yuhhh 💯💯💯
This needs to win an award
The people who disliked this... having bad days😭
When I listen to SZA songs, I became     ♡︎ a e s t h e t i c♡︎
If you don't like SZA I hope your ketchup is runny
Ok, this is supposed to be the opioid epidemic...got it
I love you sza !!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Finally an artist who's spiritual.
bae❤️
THE TEASER IN DA END??????
She so beautiful!
The song at the end tho 😭😭
i want SHIRT NOW
I love this this song, I had it on repeat for weeks when It came out but sorry, the video is just a no from me. It’s just so all over, I get it’s supposed to be a spiritual interpretation, she should have stuck to that and not overly sexualize it. Just before I could get into the spiritual mood of the video, she is on the pole.
Currently Googling Pole dancing classes near me👀
4:31   Un-official lyrics:  Kiss me, Danger Been so lost without you a lot about me, Ka-ansas leave me to break a soul about you  Eat it doug right now,  Feeling lost but i like it Comfort and my sense is not about me; Only got right now Feeling tapes on freezanement (???) Sim on my skin all about-  Bloodstain on my shirt  new b*tch on my nerves old-       got curves Boom back to my work, Damn b*tch you’re like 30   edit: this is only a joke
Is anyone else lost ?
I’m speechless aaaaa
sza said “this era i dance” and i love ittt
This is art , art is this . .
❤️❤️🕺🏾
GOOD DAY IN MY MIND
Perfect fit....!! Awesome!
she is ethereal.

YUP
I really like her, but sometimes it's hard to follow what she is saying in her songs without looking into the lyrics
only SZA could make pole dancing at a gas station so graceful. like wtf lol

To me personally, I think she did some type of “Alice in Wonderland”  illusion.

“Out of regret I pretend the shit never happened “ - SZA
THIS WAS EVERYTHING I IMAGINED IT TO BE
Música mô gostosinha , vive ótima  e do nada um pole dance e todo o clip bem sensualizado kkk zsa vc é icônica 💖
she on  her shroom joint #kaledscoping like a mutha
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
IT WAS THEE WEB AND SPIDER OF IT ALL FOR ME.SEXY CUTE. IM AFRAID OF SPIIDERS DOJA KEEP UP I GOOD WORK. CHARLOTTE;S WEB WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK.

“All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile I still wanna try, still believe in Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind) Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind.” Wow... the lyrics are just ....so healing ❤️

This made me question my sexuality
"I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened"
🔥🔥🔥
I love how sza really just rolled herself down the hill like that
MASTERPIECE 🙌🏼🙌🏼

@3.2k who disliked drop your instagram
Simplismente perfeito 🇧🇷
the symbolism of her reading while she’s pole dancing. powerful
I absolutely love this video.
UNACCEPTABLE FOR LOOKING THIS AMAZING
This is gonna blow up i can already tell :)
Tiktok?
I was blazed at the bar while watching this. I felt the vibe already when this song came out. Constantly playing it when I take walks
4 days and already over "4" million views- songs always get the views
YESS SZAA
Why did she bless us like that?  We don’t deserve this!!!!
Ok sooooo, this new album is about to be 🔥 🔥🔥🔥!!! I’m loving how we get a preview of the next song at the end of each video!! And the dance moves were everything!! 💕💕
Baby girl blessed us ; we grateful

literally dancing while i'm watching this
Her hair and dancing tho 😍😍😍
she be off the shrooms we won’t understand her music but i love it
I think this is before she got a nose job I'm just tired of a black people. Not being comfortable in their own skin without changing things that's a part of their heritage I think that's they take away their roots other than that I really like this song
She can do no wrong! Love it
I LOVE IT WITH ALLLLL OF MY HEART. THEEEE QUEEN SOLANA
anyways...
There is fit and than there is SZA!
This is really good💕💕💕
Eat some mushrooms
first seen tis video when I was high...let me tell you my mind was in awww!!
ooooh yesss hunni. the library is fully open.*  (*covid-19 protocols in effect.)
i literally got shiverssss
SZA, Are you okay when you fell down that hill Over grass Please to lord that she does not have injuries after this!
For history , insufficient face close ups !!
i love you queen 👑
Your songs are beautiful but I’m still waiting for Shirt to release🤡
Shit song
I can’t stop rewatching I love it 🥺🥺💕💕
Those gas prices ....

i’ve watched this about 20 times. wow.
This is great but the end, make that a whole song tooooo
Omg she’s so damn hot
Good Days 🔥
WOW
BEAUTIFUL
She top 5 💫
MY QUEEN
Yes I listen to this everyday, and what about it ?
I can’t wait for “shirt” to be released, I’m already obsessed with it
who disliked this. i want to know now.
Gorgeous
I lost count of how many times I’ve watched this video lmao
WOW this is so fuccing beautiful!!!!!
YES
Waiting on that RZA, GZA, SZA Collab
The people who disliked obviously have bad days😭
SZA AT DA PANK AND WE STAN  🥵😍
sza knew what she was doing at the end of the video
She’s so Calculated/Strategic with EVERYTHING!! She is EVERYTHING!! Album gonna be 🔥
ugh this women is so freaking fine i cant anymore
MOMMY
Still can’t stop listening to it
Goals
I’m so mad at the shade room. I thought she was dancing all fast the whole song
ainda lançou a braba no final
SZA, GIRL,  *PLSSSS* TELL ME U WONT TAKE LIKE 5 YEARS TO PUBLISH THAT SONG, I HAVE BEEN -DYINGGGGGA- TO HEAR THE FULL SONG
Sighs. I’m so sorry that y’all think this is creative excellence 🥴🤣🤷🏾‍♀️
i love video
it’s the everything for me 😍
Hmmm who was the man on the tv screen. He looks familiar.
Damn where’s a gas station when you need one 😩🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Seeing this high and feeling her music is amazing. You will actually see her twerking aggressively be normal and go with the flow ✨
the 3.1k ppl who disliked deserve a slap .
OMG I JUST REALIZED THE BEGINNING PART OF THE SONG WAS LEAKED
She needs to drop this new songgggg
Look,  Good Days is an amazing song.   But that last snippet, tho???  Gives me all the Timbaland vibes 😩😩😩
Just popped up on recommended and clicked for fun, no regrets
Wow. She's too talented for this mess. I'm a huge Sza fan too. I know all artist grow and explore but come on. Her music videos never do her music justice.. Smh  this could have been so much more classier and still exude feminity. Since when did bending over and shaking your ass become a thing black women take pride in doing?
Why does this sound like BANKS
Yasss
BRUH SHES SO BEAUTIFUL OMG
Y’all see aggressive twerking, I see artistic contemporary movement. The song encapsulates her. I love it 🤍
I use to play the hit different music video just to listen to this song at the end... now i do the same thing for the other song 😭
thank u heavens for Solána's existence!
hi sza um im a BIG fan of ur music and u think u can send me a copy of this byeeeeeee
Omg what did I just watch?!!?? This was incredible!
Despite the weird twerking.😭 i really love this video😍 very creative, something lots of artists lack these days! also love the song to!
Multitalented
She probably had so much fun doing this music vid
Amazing!!
Psychedelic
que linda sza
nothing less than an etheral godess
This reminds me of an ethereal dream.
SHE’S ETHERAL OMG
Message in the bridge hits. It's in the present now
I LOVE THIS ONFG
GET IT BEST FRIENDDD
This is a great song but the video is pure comedy...  Like wtf is she smokin nowadays lol
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💘💘💘💘
It’s the shroom trip for me. Lol ❤️
💝
Lmfao did yall see those gas prices. I thought paying 2.85 was rough. if there's really cities with 4 bucks per gallon imma just get a bike rn
Fuck ya!!
hi sza
The song + the video = the calmest experience ever
2:20
5:23 if her and her team were smart they make this a remix single
how the fuck can this human being be SO TALENTED and GOURGEOUS and EVERYTHING  AAAAAAAAAAAAAA i'm gonna freak the hell out
como las mujeres son tan hermosas
Did anyone think SZA looked liked bandy in the thumbnail or is it just me
I fid not know she made this ✨song✨
so is she cottage core now?
BLOODSTAIN OMFG
BLOODSTAIN IS COMING. OH MY GOSH! SZA YOU ARE A LIVING MASTERPIECE I LOVE YOU.
Truly beautiful 🔥💯💪🏾
Sza is on another level here with her gymnast background. The gymnast/stripper moves mix with alittle African dance. She didn't even have to sing for me. She dope reading a book in the library swinging on a stripper pole.
This is so goooooood omg!
I dont understand a single word 😂😂😂 still 🔥🔥🔥 tho
I don’t understand the concept of the video. I like the song. But I am so confused
That awkward moment when you go to a gas station and there’s no stripper pole there... 😔
No my girl definitely watched "before her eyes"
♥️
AND she directed this masterpiece!!!! This video and song make me feel whimsical <3
i like how this is kind of like the hit different music video because she sang hit different then towards the end she sang good days
You so, you so, you
this video is everything 😩😩.
bae
Soooo Scorpio .. 💛
tudo de bom essa música
🔥
😵😮Danm she Flexible ASF❤😞💯😂😭
One random thing you could watch all day: SZA swinging on Poles.
Так много американских коментариев пусть хоть один будет русский
Sza and jhene aiko should do a dam joint album.
The most creatively layered video I've seen in a LONG time...and definitely the most unique + stunning
She’s so talented ♥️♥️♥️
The part 4:30. When i heard it on tiktok. I just had to keep hearing it. SO GOOD
Perfect  !
My heart ✨
alternative realities / her inside and outside / her body in physical and her soul in the spiritual. this song is about freeing your soul and connecting the physical and spiritual realms
No Sza slander will be tolerated ‼️‼️‼️  Follow me on ig: @loreanebeonca
I loved this Sis!! Very calming/relaxing song and visuals!!!
That was one of her most amazing performances. She is so talented! Graceful and stunning.
This is exactly how I fee when I hear this masterpiece
my jaw is on the floor
Who else smiled when they saw that Jacob cameo?
I can definitely hear Frank Ocean on this song
BRUH THE ENDING OMG IM IN MY BED LIKE 🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟
I love the video but don’t get me wrong the aggravation dancing thru it off I love the different themes tho 💙
And YouTube just now telling me she made this 😩😍😍
I need a whole vacation cause SZA just did that to me and I need some time to myself now...
😍😍😍
YESSSS
Can anyone recommend me some other songs that sound like this
waiting for her to release the next song
Sza is my new inspiration 🥺❤️ I love her
💖💖💖💖💖
SZA QKDNQKNF
Black girls are so beautiful on God
I can’t wait for the album it’s gonna be the only album in whatever year it drops, 2057?
Why do feel like this song would be featured in the movie Waves!!! And if Frank collaborated with her this song would be perfect for Waves
La única parte dura para mi fue la mujer en la biblioteca. Que voz mas bella tiene esta mujer💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Good Days is an essential part of my morning ritual ✨  hearing it gets me so emotional in the best way if that makes sense
I mean it’s been said a million times, but can we PLEASEEEEEEE have a SzaXSummer collab?! Fxck it while we’re at it can the remix consist of SzaXSummerXMiamiXJT...????!!!! Please give us this for the summer...
This video makes me want to quit my job and become a stripper.
DAMN!!! Those gas prices though 😅
I love her. Her music speaks to my silent world ♥️♥️♥️
YESSSSSSS
This lady is pole dancing at a Chevron 😭
nobody:  sza: i think we should have a stripper pole
this shit is magical
2:46 sounds like a breezy adlib ,  would've probably been the greatest duet in recent history
WooooooooooooooooW
Good Day mama
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
she is so very cute and so grogginess
i love sza and good days but can someone pls explain i’m so lost
Her voice is refreshing and one of a kind!

I LOVE THISSSS SONGGGG,NUMBER ONE OF MY PLAYLISTS!!!🥰

this choreography is spectacular,i love it.
What we needed
SZA!!!, ATEEEEE HUNNY!
Nice to see a woman without surgery! Just natural beauty!!!! Love you SZA
I’m not even into this kinda shit but these vocals 🔥
🌹
*Since SZA took a long time to release a song, and ate without leaving any crumbs, imagine what Rihanna might be cooking up😭*
it's interesting how America produces these 2in1 blk woman, you have an individual receiving the highest level of education in the world and that same person is doing probably one of the most degrading jobs in the world; often this conflict is managed with the use of drugs, of which there is little research and results differ depending on the user. what an enigma, it makes you something special if you make it out alive, but if you don't it's a slow death for most. still this will be my tune for a while.
Wasn't this song also there in ' hit different ' ??
No idea what I just watched, but I LOVED IT! ❤️ ❤️
**baddie cottagecore twerking**
i await my armoured fate w a smile ☺️ 🍃 🍂🪵
SHIRT!! YAHASSSSS QUEEN KILL IT EVERYTIME QUEEN!! us stans are here for u.
come o brasil
This video is literally what i think of when I listen to this song
sza is literally the definition of ethereal
?? i thought she was muslim??
sza dancing in a library while reading a book is my sexual fantasy
♡♡♡♡
OMG THIS CAME OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY
This got Keisha Cole vibes
This is the most most amazing art
QUEEENNN
SURE DID POP TF OFFFFF
Half of you chasing the #Fountain of #Youth but it's in the #Present.Wow oh Wow
Got damn she been MURDERING the gym!!!! That strengths impeccable. Sis moved to Hawaii for her final chakra I see

Oh yeah get it ig 😍😍😍😍
First heard of Sza when she collabed with Kendrick and loved her ever since, her voice is heavenly omg🥴🥴
Just wow
i love sza but wtf
Alguém 🇧🇷?
I loved this video... So I’m going to play it again.... and again... and again.
It’s The Rolling Down The Hill For Me
I love how you always I’ve is samples of your upcoming songs at the end🥺❤️. Great video and song btw🥰
When I tell you I’m ✨obsessed✨ with SZA
DROP THE SONG SOLANA!!!
Visionary Goddess thank you for this medicine!
4:14 easier than skipping back at the end of the song
The imagery while good is really a negative connotation of a relationship. Black men already feel trapped.  I personally hate the idea myself because well - the black widow she mates and KILLS.  The fact that this is depicted as coming from the mind of the Black Man... that's truly diabolical:  He wants to be trapped, mated with and then killed.  #Diabolical
Wig snatched no edges and that on Mary had a little lamb 🐑😍😍😍
I’m sorry but the dancing 💀
how can someone don’t like sza and her voice, like????????
Menino que porrada na cara foi essa? o.o
She really is a special kind of special, Sza...
😍😍😍
Nobody gonna talk about the mushroom trip symbolism
Que música perfeita❤🇧🇷
I don't get it.
somebody wants to be a smurf!
YOU KILLED ITTTTT!!
Beautiful Sol <333
I dig that she continues to do her and be different that’s creativity that art...peace
THE NEXT SONG PREVIEW OMG STOP
*Thats right, we twerking to unlock our chakras now ladies* 😌
why am i crying rn
THE TEASE AT THE END OMFG I LOVE YOU
this is fr the thing i think of when I listen this this whole aesthetic
What's the name of the new song?

I love anything Sza pits out, but this is my favorite song she's made.
Dont Lie WE ALL did the TikTok dance at the end!!!
Goddesss 🤯
Wow just beautiful... Took my breath away w(°ｏ°)w

Damn sza Was no half ass stripper like me lmao 😂
you know, you've reached a high goal in life, when you don't miss a text you chose not to read... damn she's good.
This is exactly what I wanted the music video to look like.
Sza poledancing in a library is a whole new level of FIRE
god she’s gorgeous
Why is she so fucking scrumdiddlyumptious? Look at the way she vibing, you can tell she was feeling this.
the video hasnt even started and I know this about to be a serve
that thang do be thangin
When Sza said 'feeling like Jericho, feeling like Job when he lost his shit' I felt that in my soul
I ain't even mad at this video! I need a pole in my house! Lol
I really thought she was gonna be one of the mushrooms
I love her 😍 best video 🤍
aggressively twerks
Damn bae you ate this up
So I need a pole and some mushrooms. Got it. Thank you queen
Cottagecore twerking
The last part made me wanna become a ✨STRIPPER✨
i love you! ah go off with that feminine energy
Never misses 🤌🏼
giving very much fairy princess
OMG I LOVEEEEEEEEE
Simply beautiful, original, she snapped 👑🍄🥰😍🤎🖤♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
In love❤️🙌🏾
Hebanna Sizakele really gave us anotther teaser at the end when Good Days started out as a teaser.
She definitely ate..... <3!! 😍 And definitely didn't miss to see that sneak peek at the end👀
SHE NEEDS TO RELEASE THAT SONG AT THE END!!
Mano quem deu deslike é desumano dmais 😩😩
why you so pretty
Ayooo Jacob collier in the green tv?👀
She radiates so much goddess energy it's magical
THE WAY I GT STUCK STARING AT THE SCREEN FOR THE FIRST TWO MINS I HAD TO SNAP OUT OF IT... I GOT LOST IN THE VISUAL FR
Wow! All I can say is, nicely done. So very pretty. 😊
pls take my hand in marriage
*S Z A*
Another day of my queen slaying🥵
Finally ong 😭❤️❤️
SOLANA!!!!! i need this song and album desperately 😖😖. love you girl bye 🌻💞
BIG SCORPIO ENERGY
She's like and dark version of jhene aiko
Um-
"Good Day" part was amazing. I left my heart at the library scene!!!!! But I hope this isn't the only MV for "Shirt". WE NEED THE FULL SONG QUEEN!
YASSS SHIRT AT THE ENDDDDD I think that’s what it’s called 🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️
Any came here aftr brtman rock story????
Smh pothead
I’m in love
wow you killed this SZA!
It’s the imagery and symbolism for me! Living for this!!
i'm glad seeing her pole dancing!
Geniusly wicked...the SZA version of evoking her own  "Sasha fierce." Just like when Eve bit the apple, or in this case the library. Beautiful veil of lust and deceit 😊
This is the performance crackheads think they're giving at train stations
is this what happens after taking shrooms?
Am I the only one that erykah badu vibes from her?🤔
OMG thats soooo Cool
YESSS
Anyone saw Jacob Collier on the TV  SZAxJacobCollier 🥜🥜🔥🔥
not the likes being at 444k
Sza.
Omggggg Sza is the next level goddess we all need to bless our lives <3
i can play this song every day and never get tired of it!!
Please with the last song feature Miguel!!!!💕💕💕💙💚💙

2:19 was the best part of the video
AS YOU SHOULD!
Got pure chills through this whole thing
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Visual Perfection as usual!!!! My fav song rn feeling satisfied!
is any girl left straight after this gem?
This song hits in all the spots
Those jacob collier vocals in the background👌👌
beauty
This is my go to song when I spark that blizzy 😙👌🏽💨
What an artist
My God Sza what was that? More than different ... Something out of the ordinary that brought magic through culture, something that brought expression, feeling and sensuality! We need more clips like that! Something different and representative !!!
this album is already going to be iconic
Always steps it up from the last video. Amazing !
I be dancing to this like I’m on the next step😜🕺🏽💃🏽
DIVINE

Godess ❤️❤️❤️
This was already my jam now the vid made me like it even moreee🧡🧡🥰
And to think this whole time I'm smoking out while writing music and shrooms were the key all along
Thoroughly impressed by her core and upper body strength to pull off these pole-dancing moves. DAMN.
so beautiful. so moving. period!
Such a beautiful spirit 😻❤️
could you imagine pulling up for gas and this ....
This is so amazing,just what my soul needed ❤️
this song is everything gn
Ion listen to this woman but I need to engage to get this lady them numbers
i love you sizzle
Convinced SZA is a magical human being who sings our feelings aloud
Best video thus far this year 🔥🔥♥️♥️👁‍🗨👁‍🗨

Love love love it!!! Get rid of the toxicity!!!
I waited for this for so long and I am not disappointed, I LOVE THIS SM ❤️

*mushrooms*  she really knows her audience

What's she reading tho? 😳
weirdest mv i have seen lol , but its fun to watch bcs its kinda unique hahaha
She should call her next album " Shift"
I love this outro.... where da full song at 👀😍
She put her foot on necks in this visual
cool
Absolutely gorgeous art 🍄
i want to live in sza's aesthetic
Mulher tu é perfeitaaa fms
fuck the haters this shit is fire
This is just proof black woman run this world as we know it.
but can we talk about the fact that she directed this herself
THE SNEAK PEAK OF THE SONG AT THE END💖
Everyone disliking this must hate their life or must not be having those good days 😪
Perfect for the morning shroomies 🧚🏼
Beatiful Song and Great Video!
Mushrooms everywhere!
The song at the end tho.
SAY IT WITH ME: THIS IS THERAPEUTICN!! SZA giving us the good vibes
i got goosebumpsss omggggg
LEFT ZERO CRUMBS
Anna Diop from Titans needs to take notes
I LOVE how she is more confident! just GLOWING ♥️
I’m gonna tell my kids this is Mother Nature
Directors: What percent of aesthetic? SZA: Yes.
Sza or summer walker ? It's sza for me
OKAY SZA ROCKIN THAT COTTAGECORE VIBES
she literally is one of the if not the prettiest woman I have ever seen
That’s it...This is my healing song✨
I’m sobbing
So we’re just gonna ignore the fact that she shifted 😀
Yaaassss sza that was everything 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. And that Tyra Banks orange hair is bringing back a strong obsession of mines I had as a kid. I just knew my hair was going to be that color all the time when I grew up 😂 I’m going to need to cop me some of that hair.
I too dream of pole dancing in a library 😂😂
I CANNOT WAIT
Sza takes her time to make sure the song sounds beautiful 💌 rushing her made her push herself even more and we love the fact that all genders can listen to her and not be judged <3 amazing sza we love you🤍
I KNEW IT SHE HAD TO RELEASE IT I REALLY THPUGHT IT WAS NAMED SHIRT UGHHH
She is magic 💖
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
So am I the only one e who saw Jacob Collier 🤯
This is why I live sza she always hints her new songs in her current songs like in 19’s music
🙄Can’t believe the best part of the song is soo short
I just gained a new appreciation of pole dancing.  Beautiful!
🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️she did that!!

my queen bru
the divine feminine energyyyy exuded from this video SHEEEEESHHH
Thanks man for this and you
😫🔥❤️
I love you ❤
Should have been a better MV, bad director.
SZA is so beautiful i love her so much🥺❤️
Wait another preview ..... what are you up to sza 🤔😍
Ngl this music video kinda confusing? But pop off gorgeous nonetheless
Her falling down the hill sent me into orbit
Suis encore plus fan..Rien à dire ...
Nice. Looks like something Teyana Taylor would do.
This video had to be made after the cameo on hit different ...love it!!!!
I remember when sza said she wasn’t gonna make music anymore and I was sooooooo sad !! Now I’m sooo happy and her music is sooo good ☺️☺️
i love her sm stop 😩
This is definitely where Alice in Wonderland meets P-Valley. Awesome visuals and dancing although when you were twerking twerking I wasn’t sure which song you was twerking to. Love it SZA!
Thanks to Rosie I now know this great song!
She ate 🤚🏾🤍🤎
This shits weak
I've had such a rough week. Thoughts of suicide, my lover disappeared (might even be dead), and I'm not living at home for the time being. Hearing this....after all of that..... helps. Thank you SZA. Thank you for being an inspiration and aid to my wounds. Despite all the things I'm going through I still want to have good day. My goal in this life is to heal every aspect of myself mind, body, and soul to become the best creator I can be. Music like this helps me keep going, so thank you so much for your art. And to anyone reading this remember there is love and life all around you, it starts within you. You are capable of so much and deserve a pleasurable and beautiful life. And know that I love you, cute stranger :p.
I cant watch the video n listen to the song im so confusing
At first I thought it was weird but it totally goes with the song
genius genius
The beginning of the song was so aesthetic
She took a shroom trip, I’m convinced 🍄😌
we'll be listening to this in 5 years from now.
I just want to scream " I WORRY THAT I WASTED THE BEST OF ME ON YOU BABY, YOU DON'T CARE" every time I hear it
Wow, I never was a SZA music lover, but after this video😍🥰 🎧You did this👌
Essa mulher é linda e foda. 😍🔥👏
IZA FEAT SZA! QUEM APOIA?? 🔥🇧🇷🍀🙏😍
nobody's gonna talk about how multiple tiny green jacob collier faces are radomly popping while she twerks in the woods ?? Literally the best music video of the year.
OMG YASSSSSS QUEEN
A magical world that many people dream of
The cooing lotion mechanistically cry because toast wessely attend sans a rainy house. lacking, blue-eyed bed
THE SNIPPET AT THE END IS AMAZING👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽SZA IK YOUR PLAYING THIS IS BOMB
just give us the whole DAMNNN SONGGG we dying out here
She was having a shrooms trip One with nature hence why she was sticking out of the ground like a mushroom then doing interpretive dance (she’s  ballerina and gymnast in real life)... knowledge is paper with all the pages on the floor like money in a strip club...these are things she likes do no they’re showing up in her trip.... she was reading a book before tripping.....you’re  going to GAS HER UP by the time it’s over
she’s just gotta be my wife someday
https://youtu.be/DfTPdA_mwj4 🖤🖤
psychedelic R&B is what i need in my life
Jesus is coming.  “Watch therefore for no man knows the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming”-Matthew 25:13  Know that God “desires for all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth” -1 Timothy 2:4   “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that you may have life and have it to the full “-John 3:16   And “if you acknowledge and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord(Is recognising his pow prayerer , authority and majesty as God) and believe in you heart the God raised him from the dead will be saved” -Romans 10:9   Follow Him.
I recomend y'all to listen to SZA when you're high... that voice is so hipnotizing and beautiful... it would be an experience hehe i love her!!
Jacob Collier @ 2:29 😉
sza is so stunning 💫
4:30 for all the people also hyped for this snippet to come out
Damnnnn SZA you did it again! U SLAY IT GURL🙌🙌
I love how this song has morphed through so many different versions
Killed it
here for all of it but you see the ending😍😍😍😍
PERFECT
Damn Sza wtf
That was absolutely amazing 😻
It’s a yes from me.
Listen stop playing with me rn ✋
i love how she springs from the ground, circling like a plant does as it comes up before it just explodes with life
all i can say is wow😍😍
She is a real life queen 👑
The outro is everything 😩😩😩
the fact that shirt starts at 4:20....
We all came to see mother nature :))
The realist 🦋
I love her voice
Feelings goosebumps all over my bodyyyyyyyyyyyy
She was dancing so artistically but all of a sudden she started TWERKINGGGG
"baby baby baby"  agressive spin
😍
Who’s here before 10 million views? 🙋‍♀️
🍄  "I don't miss no ex,  I don't miss no text, they choose not to respond"🍄 -SZA🍄
3:03 - 3:14 best part ❤️😍
😒 i was soo excited for the video and ...this just UPSET me.. omg! I expected a nostalgic, experience and got something weird liiike. wtf SZA? 🤦🏾‍♀️ rolled down that hill HARD as hell.. like nooo!!!!👎🏾
I feel like I'm on psychedelics watching this... I love it here
The dislike button should be illegal on this video
yesss omg u ate
*ethereal twerking*
Girl- I- not her teasing us at the end
Im in love with this song
so beautiful
I wish I could work that pole the way she did....sis was 🔥🔥
Wait..... I am confused is this the Shirt song or what?!!?  first of all that cant be it like nawwwww second  whaaaaaaaaaaa Third  SLAPS!!! idc  but she gotta stop teasing us with this song damn.... smh
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Now I want a Solange feature 😩😩😩 They would be so magical together‼️
Ok I’m in love with this song and the music video is awesome. I love the mushrooms. But I feel like the choreography doesn’t match the song. I don’t know. But I still love it, she’s so talented and has a great voice.
Crazy comments in here. Lotta feminists drivel. Wonder what GUY produced the song. Women usually don’t produce songs that sound this good. When I see Sza videos I click because she’s sexy. I can never understand what she’s saying anyway. Just stop trying to intellectualize a woman using sex to promote herself. It is what it is. Josephine Baker did it. Madonna did it. Janet Jackson as well. Nothing new. People see young hot chicks, they pay attention
$4.39 for gas!!?
I fckng loveeee you
I have a feeling that she watched Made in Abyss when creating this music video         Only weebs know what I mean 😂
After all this time???
Shrooms and that gas huh Sza?😉 Medicate and meditate on the pole  There you go! Love it! #NoBreaks
The music is perfect 👌🏽
please realise the song
Library scene 😍😍
Oh that’ll happen when ya hanging out with that caterpillar. #strangeclouds
Damn she showing off real good
she need to release shirt already she keep playin with us🤦🏾‍♀️
When I heard this first on tiktok, I thought it was Melanie Martinez😳 Anyways, they're both QUEEN 👑💃🏼
THAT TEASER AT THE END!!!!!!!! MISS GIRL HAS BEEN TEASING US FOR TOO LONG, PLS DROP IT ALREADY I KNOW ITS GONNA BE THIRST TRAP OF THE YEAR😫😫
When is shirt gone be release :^:
anyone else waiting for shirt to drop on spotify... 👇
SZAAAAA this is not mannn, keeps teasing us with that last song, I want to absorb, listen to it on repeat for ever
Today's music is such a trash. All about sex Booty shaking and shit 0% talent. I miss the 90s
Wow.., I didn't get it till the end, but this video and her dream are all from a "mushroom trip" ** sighs**
Ngl, I’m confused , I love this 💞
yo how could someone dislike this??
purrrrr
Best video I've seen in a minute... the talent! Thanks Queen.
MUSICA MARAVILHOSA
Wow 😳
Pure perfection! Everything I needed and more! 🤯😍
when is your next song coming out I love the beginning of it
Then she lead us on with another banger at the end! Girl stop playin!!! #loveit
ouuu lawd that wig do not come off
Thank you Mark for introducing such a beautiful song.. SZA's voice is sooo nice
what that got to do with the song ?
whenever i'm feeling bad i just start dancing to this song it's like a healing song for me
here before 5M
i wonder what made her want the theme to be the wild  whatever made her make this design, I agree with
Ok but she is the definition of COTTAGECORE WTFFFFF
Okay now this music video is actually really interesting
🧡
Why didnt anyone tell me?? Cmon, gays..
So shirt is the next single and I after that I really want her to release never knew
Guess that’s all she’s got now. That feminine energy is on full display. Appreciate the confidence she has after getting fit. That pole dancing routine takes so much strength and endurance. Good for her. I’m motivated lol.
been streaming this since the first minute 😩
When shirt comes out it’s over for the others .. she is not one of them
I love this ugh
YES
the way the twerking didnt match the flow of the song 😭💀. Im here for it tho 😌✋🏾
OMGGGG SZA?????
I wonder how many grams she ate for that performance lol
Gorgeous, Amazing, Creative, Emotional.
love her so much but what plant did she smoke ? asking for a friend
Surprised I don’t see niccoya in these comments
im begging you please release bloodstains/shirt as its own song the people have been needing this for so long
Awwwww!!!!! This song is sooo beautiful and like specifically perfect.  ❤️🍄
Am in love with this song 💝🥰🥰😍🤩🤩😍it's so connecting and so inspiring 🇰🇪💯
Twerk SUPERLICIOUSLY  Noted 📝

GOOD DAYS (LYRICS)   Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear, if you let me Feeling like (on your own) Feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby Heavy on my empty mind shit I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (my mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind) good days (good days on my mind) Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
Is she supposed to be the 🐛 from Alice in wonderland?

This was absolutely hypnotic and ethereal. Incredible.
Solona eu te amo mulher !!!!! ENTREGA DEMAIS !
She did that dance. she is the best dancer
I too have a stripper pole in my study.😂🔥

How does she make stripping look spiritual 🤣✨
LOVE IT HERE 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨✨✨🧚🏾‍♀️🧚🏾‍♀️🧚🏾‍♀️🧚🏾‍♂️🧚🏾‍♂️🧚🏾‍♂️🧚🏾‍♂️🧚🏾‍♂️🦄
No one: Literally no one: SZA pole dancing in a library because she's just *that* cool:
PLEASE RELEASE SHIRT ALREADY I CAN'T HANDLE THE SUSPENSE, ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT ENDING SCENE!!!!
Love Sza💕

Nobody: How did u like the SZA video  Me: idk whats happening 🤣 I'm so lost on this one.

This woman is perfect.
*claim your “here before 5M” ticket here*
ɪᴄᴏɴɪᴄ
Amoonguss uses rage powder.
Let’s call the last one ascension
sza i literally love you for this
Wow so beautiful
This is my Favourite VIDEO of 2021 PERIODT!!!!!
YES GIRL SHOWIN THAT STRIPPERS CAN STILL ENJOY BOOKS AND BE SMART AF SZA COME THROUGH WIT THE SPLITS !!!!
SZA is going to become one of the biggest what if’s of her generation. She has the potential to be a legit pop star. But I don’t think she’s committed enough to her craft to see the bigger picture.  Get your choreography down pact, learn voice control, and rebrand SZA.  This whole earthy girl vibe not it anymore lol
I’m lost.
Bruh this music sounds so FRESH 😆✨
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out?

Beautiful
Walk by faith and not by sight❤️
She brought that heat. She sirected her own video this time. Solange Knowles directed her video on her first album which hid a lot of her talents. No shade just stating facts. No dancing just Sza singing around empty buildings. Not until this video did I realize what an accomplished dancer she is. BRAVO SZA
🔥🔥💙
if this is what happens when you do shrooms then lemme get some
Why does every prostitute think they are talented?
IM WILLING TO DIE FOR U SZA 😩
Moment of silence for those who just found out who is she through tik toc
"Liked" the vid before it even started 🙌❤
Am I the only one who wants to know where tf is gas $4.399 a gallon at?
LUV U SZAA <333
cenário me lembrou a matéria de Toxicología
My comfort song just got longer 😭😭 thank you queen!!
This is THE jam!!! 🤌🥵
Protect SZA at all cost, she's a rear Gem...
Yesss Sza😩😩
Ahhh this song hits so good. And I’m a whole sucker for contemporary dancing ❤️
SZA I TRUE DEFINITION OF BEAUTY, THIS SONG IS DOPE GOLD, IF IT FEATURED AB-SOUL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLATINUM MANIFESTED
i love you 🤟😔
Beauty.
She can do no wrong ❤️
This is the only video where you are allowed to comment * starts aggressively twerking * okay.
And then she leaves us with another cliffhanger
the fact that she is 30 and looks this good  and she can pole dance she is truly gods gift
Sza is a goddess 😍😍😍😍🥺
Omg why are you still single man😩
omg i love*rolls down mountain*
SZA RELEASE THE DAMN SONG ALREADY
The ending definitely sounds like a Jhene song
Absolutely clever! She never let's us down. Her vibe, sound, and voice literally soothes me.😌🙌🏽❤ I simply can't get enough. On another note please release "Shirt"!🙏🏽
this video is a mood.
This is all a shroom trip this is HARD DROP THE ALBUM!
Thanks Sza, love you :)
That’s the kind of twerk I do when I get good news
Bro what was the twerking😭😭😭😭
This a special lady right here
her songs are just damn 😩😩💞
Just dropped the most littest music video, we are the next migos yall but a duo version!
Sza has the most beautiful radiant energy, she’s the most unique and is a true gold in the music industry ⚜️👸🏾
I have an unhealthy obsession with the last min 🤩 💃
No homo this hard
😍❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*𝙨𝙖𝙙 𝙩𝙬𝙚𝙧𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜*
Someone said she twerk because in these airpods  she was listening to spanish music
She is so LIT bruh🥰
SZA is clearly showing there are two ways to vibe to this song 😂
lmaoo im so confused but yaass queen 😂😂
Fun Fact: Every second of this video can be used as a wallpaper
AHHH OMG THIS IS WAYYY TOO GOOD XX
The creativity is perfect😍
He and cris brown should do a remix, omfg that would be amazing
Love it that u song trending here in Jamaica🇯🇲🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔫⭐🎶🎧💯 love u music
sza seja louvada
Girl quit teasinnnn I need shirttt 😫 legit jumped for joy when I heard it at the end
I want the ENTIRE ALBUM like yesterday.
im sorry but i laughed when she rolled over 😭
She’s doing a specific type of dancing that I forgot the name of😖
I think I'm hallucinating on some magic mushroom.
Glorious
well damn- 😭
ayyyy the shirt song
I miss the good days too SZA but the rona messed it up
This woman is a baddie and so so underrated 🔥🔥🔥
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p3zZoraK9g
Okay I'm out to pole dancing class✌
Moves like A  GOLD METAL GYMNASTIC champ.
I've been waiting for this my whole entire life
Dont do drugs kids
Giving Nicki Minaj vibe with that one video when she had that red hair in in the jungle
4:46 this song 😍
Holy shit this is beautiful
That weave strong tho when she aggressively head rolls
I’m obsessed
Is the mushrooms for me 😇, always love her

love it solana
SHIIIIRRTTTTT PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU’RE COMING IN
So peaceful 🥰
i love the aesthetic of this music video #gooddaysisthemusicvideooftheyear
I just keep rewinding to 2:43
When she’s reading the book and the snippet at the end  I couldn’t be happier with this video
🤦Am I the only one that swings my hair around like she does in the beginning every time I hear this song? 📹 is awesome💕💕
Imagine disliking this song 🤡
Can't believe some armys toxic asses attacking her cause she said happy birthday to j-hope

“Feeling lost but i like it, Comfort in my sins.”
I know this song from Mark Lee~ thanks to him bcs the song is so freakin' good
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear, if you let me Feeling like (on your own) Feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby Heavy on my empty mind shit I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (my mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind) good days (good days on my mind) Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
What vibe is this video supposed to be? Its like cute & wholesome but also theowing it back vigorously at the same time.. Either way, im a fan haha
*shut upppp*
When she started breaking it down🤪😁🥺😩
RELEASE SHIRT PLS IM DYING HERE 😭😭😭
This song makes me wanna cry every time 😩😭
am I the only one who just found out this Goddess is 30-
........
What’s the second song? Anyone know 👀
How is she so magical
Okaaaayyyyy if there's FKA Twigs now here's SZA Shrooms
I hate that I can't watch her videos properly.
Bruh her songs are actually good and they look like they take time and she doesn’t rush them. Yes, her songs take forever to come out but, at least she isn’t like any of these other musical artists who make a song almost everyday and doesn’t put no effort into the songs. Good job SZA, your a wonderful woman.
THE LAST PART
sza does not miss!!
finally queen ily

the vibes this video gives me---
hood days
She is 🔥 🔥🔥 And very much slept on
Shroom trip ooooooooo 😍
ti amo
I love her so much <3
As a heterosexual male I can honestly say this is one of the most beautiful visuals that I’ve seen in a long time. There’s sooo much to unpack in this video where do I begin? Oh I know, let’s start with those mushrooms she’s hinting at the fact that in this video she having a mushroom trip? Not sure maybe a reach but also just the divine femininity that sza gives off in this video just feels healing. Mfs gotta give women they props and stop acting like y’all don’t be doing y’all shit fr especially blackwomen I thank y’all forever for being the mothers of everything that ever existed☯️🕉☮️🐛🦋🔮👸🏾
I don’t think many people are realising that this video is very much spiritual. With the instruments and the visuals 🕉☯️💜
Dmt effect
anyone want some magic mushrooms
💋💋💋
Giving me life!😍
The lil Sneak of ‘bloodstains’ is the cherry we never knew we needed

After the title the first thing zi thought about was (in Drake's singing voice): "Listening to SZA like usual Just sitting and chilling like usual Her voice is too fire, she's doing too much  This song is too fire, I'm too turnt up"
Wheres the part where she has the bead braids?
goddamn shes amazing
Creativeness is so unique. Water signs lol love it sis

She a artist artist! There's depth in both the lyrics and the video, and then it's also light. Whew.. I could watch this all day.
I love you SZA🥰🥰🥰
Need a remixes with Summer Walker that would be DOPE
*Even though SZA takes decades to release songs, at least they never sound rushed. Her songs always sound so beautifully layered or carefully thought out.*
AM I THE ONLY WHO YELLED WHEN “DIRECTED BY SOLANA” CAME UP HOLY SHIT GOD IS A WOMAN INDEED
1:15 me choking on my food:
Yesss sis!! 😩😻👑
Look at all these aesthetics. Beautiful.
Cade os BR carai
it’s sounds like : Alicks - Giants under the sea
i feel like SZA is the Te Fiti of Maui 😩
You never fail 😍
My favorite artist of the 21st century
yo did chick have a but plug while twirling down
it's jacob featurette for me, glad he had a screen time😏
🥰😍
Prescriptions put you in wonderland with crushed mushrooms inside medicine balls, tumbling hills and losing track of time and importance and believing beliefs of hypnotize and influencing weakness with a spirit illness you can control and plug up with air in wirelessly on command and given a program and a trend.
ouuuu
SZA IS SUCH A ICON WE LOVE THE ENDING OMGOSH THE UNRELEASED NOW RELEASED I STAN
Sza u ate 🤎🔥
I truly love her music ..❤

This on shrooms issssssss. Wow
SZA invented mushrooms a queen methinks
Gooo✨
But did y’all see that gas price tho 4 fuckin dollars

That jade split and leg hang on the pole. She has been training hard. I can’t express how much I love this song and video. I spent most of the pandemic listening to her music and pole dancing.
Who the hell knows what this video is about but it's very entertaining
Yess Solana!
Yesss yesss yessss
3:13
In the weirdest way I feel trapped in this moment and it’s so deep!!! I can’t explain it
i was not ready for the ending...
This is stunning. SZA's dance moves are fire bro.
Fire

she always teases us with a preview of her next song 😩
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
If Alice in Wonderland was a Ebony Queen and went down that rabbit hole.🔥
This is like a dream
did Jacob Collier help with the production?
SHE SNAPPEDDD
If  Posion Ivy was mocha AF  this what she would  sing to  seduce her plants  ☘️🔥
im not the only one who saw those mushrooms moving right😅im kind🍃but they did move right
so nobody is gonna talk about the ode to CTRL in this video or???

I FCCKN SCREAMED. Yessssss
Wtf It's a nawl for me
Reminds me of That one FKA twigs music video
This is my spiritual awakening
“Have you never heard? Have you never understood? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of all the earth. He never grows weak or weary. No one can measure the depths of his understanding. He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless. Even youths will become weak and tired, and young men will fall in exhaustion. But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭40:28-31‬ ‭
finallyyyyyyyyy SHE BETTER NAME THAT SONG BLOODSTAIN OR NERVES ✨😩
Love the song Love the video 💞.... but can we talk about these stripper shoes and socks??? Is that gonna be a thing now? Cuz I'm for it... lol
She is basically telling us to do shroom say less baby I wanna shroom with her tho

Melodic gibberish to my ears. <3
Szaaaaa saving the summer season
C H I L L SSSSS

dope
2:20 how I crawl out of the bed
That was Jacob Collier on the tv right?
I screamed when she started play shirt
The gymnastics came out in this one I love Solàna odee!
love you forever 💕
I love
Loved the video, great job girl 💖
SHAKE THAT SACRAL CHAKRA UP BABY all this divine feminine energy I’m so here for it
I love this song, and I like this video too. Something about this speaks to me, the earthiness, the vulnerability. Something about it is so cleansing and peaceful. It's like going out for a run early in the morning, and you're at the top of a hill, breathing fresh air, watching the sunrise washing everything in golden light 🌞💖
YES
I will never forget the moment that happened a couple of hours ago where we were testing audio for something in the auditorium at my school and just start playing this full blast with the video on the screen. Let's just say.....it was turned off pretty fast
There is 2.6k haters in this world.
❤❤🙊
Such a dope outlet of creative expression
I will have what she’s having!!!!!
1:31 that just prove girls can do both...
if you listen to sza you have a great music taste
EVERYTHING IS SOOO GOOD but the direction. Like the editing is a bit off, a lof of things are unnecessary. The "hit different" good day sneakpeak was just tastier. But she's still amazing on this one don't get me wrong!! It's just the director's choices are weird. (same director tho, not a Good Day for her maybe lmao)
Had to pause this a sec.....sis is giving us body yody yody. Her shit is beautiful!! No homo! Shit I just might try it for her. Lol
woah
I can't even explain how sexy I find her😳.
🥰🥰🥰
Everyone Stay up and blessed gang 🤘🏾
she's a goddess
She so damn dope🔥🔥
tudo pra mim
SZA the song was good but what the fuck is this ong
YALL. I WAS DANCING THIS SONG A FEW WEEKS AGO AND LOOK WHAT SHE DOING OMGGGG

Based on the vibe it’s all bout good night instead *evil smirk*
"Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now" ❤️ TruDeep

As if feeding my soul with these lyrics wasn’t enough 🧘🏽‍♀️🕯 Here she comes with the video and I’m lost in meditation 🧘🏽‍♀️🕯🤎✨
i didnt felt time past watching to video. Thanks you Solana for this great piece of art.
another worldly. sza.
AHHHHH
let's all wait for the good days
So fine.
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up dear ones. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of Fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
Haven't felt this type of vibe since hearing Trilogy. Damn
nah she tapping into another level rn
This is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen
meu deus essa mulher é surreal 😭😭😭

Miss Gurl pretty please drop the song ik u just dropped this music video 🥺❤️
Chills at the end 🥺 I’m in love with her. It’s the cliffhanger for me
Queen
4:31 is the sneak peak
ATTTTTEEEEEEEE🥵🥵🥵🥵
I AM NOT CRYING ALONE!!
sza is mother nature herself
Why you dancing so aggressively shawty
This is straight up creativeness all the way.
Complete freedom of self expression
This is how I feel when Im inside a Library
SZA is top tier 😟😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
addicted to the video
PLEASE DROP “SHIRT” omggg
Anyone else add a goal to the list?  -pole in the library!
Not me laughing
I know yall saw that sneak peak tho👀👀
You own my heart
Cadê os brasileiros que curtem um bom som??
So far my favorite song of 2021. I’m loving this chick more and more.
I NEED THE REST OF THE LAST SONG CMON SZA STOP PLAYING.
🖤
Ironic how the scene/song switches exactly at 4:20
Yess she finna drop the shirt song in a whilee yall
I need shirt to cope with 2021
Is this what plants feel when they are going through photosynthesis?
Artist
she knew very well what she was doing with that lil snippet at the end
Can y’all stfu about when you found sza. And stop telling newcomers not to listen just because they might’ve found her on TikTok. No one fucking cares when u found her, let’s just appreciate her voice. Y’all got this “I walked so that you newcomers could run” mentality, and it’s fucking obnoxious. Just listen and carry on with your day.
who is here for Jacob Collier?
Anyway...
as you should
3:14 Theres a lot to unpack here
😍😍
keep calm and sza on
THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED
My goodness I love Sza
Beautiful love it 😍💕🤗❤️👏👏👏👏
So proud to be a Scorpio!🥰
its always the ORANGE for me
the dance and video represents growth, she started off as a plant in the ground then 'found her feet' and was able to fully live/express herself. so beautiful and the choreo is top notch. Wouldn't expect anything less from Paris <3
The most beautiful soul ever😌❤️

I want to be a super fan, but feel so sad when she says she is leaving music. I dont want her to quit music, and dont want to lose a favorite artist. Stay SZA please?
Is she mumble singing... I hardly understood anything she was saying or am I trippin??
one of my speakers was broken i clicked on this video and  the speaker started working again  just as the music started playing
SZA...Black Goddess!

Good music will eventually travel.
Eu amo essa musica,essa musica é perfeita e tudo pra mim
She always lying about shit
New song at the end has a familiar cadence & snare hits.. producer better pay homage ..
That dancing is reminding me of a soytycd bad contemporary audition. She's just going so hard.. is she crumping?
we love educated strippers
she is ethereal
I love u 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩🫀🤲🏾
god is a womannnnnnn
Switching up her style ! Luv it.
When she said “damn bitch you like 30” 😢 that shit brought memories when she wrote problems she faced when she was 20
Inspired by fka twigs eh?

I don’t get it
I want to learn poll dancing now
Uuuunnnh, I love everything about this. Odd comparison but her movement remind me of a demon from a nollywood movie. 😂👌
I’m so fucking grateful to be alive witnessing this blessing
The end 😍😍

Got damn that gas high 😐
I was making an r and b playlist when I was looking into SZA again and i remember listening to this song the day it came out.

Holy shit that was so good!
SZA twerkin in the garden lives rent free in my head
why is nobody talking about how she took us to a shroom trip and the cinematic while she's on it so on point  and it resembles so much at the feelings and thoughts you get when you are high on that, also the song makes so much more sense now
I NEED SHIRT RN ITS EVERYTHING

She’s so beautiful 🥺🥺✨✨🤎🤎🤎
Random person: How much do you wanna pole dance in this video? SZA: Yes.
Me dancing in my room 🙈
Damn I woke up toooooo tired. I thought this was for The Little Mermaid or something. 😅😅
yes yes YES
Omg I love her steps, her hair like Moana's 💜✨
Beautiful visuals !
Good lawd yes
“ I don’t miss no ex I don’t miss no text I chose not to respond”
Where's frank?
I couldn't even imagine me imagining this tune, its so strange but good.
Sza’s body is SICKENING 😍😍😭
Who is disliking this beautiful work of art tf
A gata arrasa
Art and beauty at its finest. So tranquil
Does she just decide on a random day “hey, let me drop this and take over the music industry again” honestly. She never made a bad song. All her songs are hits. 🔥🔥
this feels like a shroom trip. she captured it perfectly
Got damn that second song though!
my wifey got it!
0:57 e shoke  If you know you know
Whatever I'm feeling when I'm listening to Good Days, those feelings are not conveyed in this video.  SZA on a pole is very impressive though.
🥺🥺🥰🥰
THE AGGRESSIVE TWERKING 😭😭😭😭
2:37 JACOB COLLIER !!!

Video version of this song on clip hit different was very better
I was hoping she would do the tik tok dance for that last bit at the end
Someone better than me make a gif of her rolling down that hill pls
wow
SZA is leading the Industry after Queen B
Is this what being on drugs feels like?
just me who thinks this music video does not go with the music or lyrics and is really random.... like i love her music but this just really didnt go with the theme
BEAUTIFUL
This song gives me a positive vibes. Thank you.
Good days in my mind
Who’s here for Jacob Collier? 🙋‍♂️

That sneak peak at the end though 👀
SZA, H.E.R and Ella Mai should just do a song a call it S.H.E 👌❤
Love the song but I don't think the video matches....this felt like she was trying to show her sexy, sensual side per usual BUT all these pole tricks should have been used in a another video... great body! Wrong video😒
How to inhale a YouTube vedio?
BLOOD STAIN ON MY SHIRT NEW BITCH ON MY NERVE
Its crazy how this MV is EXACTLY what i imagine when listening to the audio
Uhhhh finallyyy😍😍😍
SZA waited until Summer got pregnant to reclaim her R&B throne and then proceeded to outdo Summer at her previous profession. Devious 🙆🏾‍♀️

Is it just me or this song hit different then the song call hit different like she made hit different it was good then she made this song is good then at the end it a another good song like what I just love her music💯🗣
the only smurfette i stan
Sorry but i listen this on my BAD DAYS
Scorpio queen less goooo
Yo Mark Lee I know you've been here
Thumbnail: Praying to herself   ...Read more
I absolutely love her music however, it won't hurt to have at least one video that make sense with the lyrics she writes..
EVERYTHING IS JUST WOW
IM HERE TO SAY SZA NEEDS TO PRONOUNCE HER WORDS ALOT MORE CAUSE WE DON’T KNOW WHAT TF SHE SAYING MOST THE TIMES... My co-worker heard me singing the song today & said “I NEVER KNEW WHAT SHE SAID”.....  like yea your song sounds good but wtf are you talking about🤔⁉️
this amazingly gives me nostalgia of every moment I’ve ever felt like a bad bitch.
SHE DID IT TO US JUST LIKE AT THE END OF THE HIT DIFFERENT VIDEO!!
Why was her rolling down the hill the most relatable part?
yesss😍😍😍
Wtf is this shit?🙄🤦🏽‍♀️🤣💀
Her vocals are so beautiful and this song is so beautiful it shows true artistry and pure talent. But why do so many black female artist feel like they need to take their clothes off and shake their ass to get recognition? Or is that some sort of requirement in America? No matter how much talent you have, no matter how much artistry and vision.. you have to get damn near naked for people to listen? Why? I don't get it. I've been listening to this song non-stop for months, it's amazing but.. it's worth so much more that a strip tease.
omg this is utter shit .WTF happen to real talent
uma coisa bem vegana né moris
I didn't blink once
Divine Femininity. Divine Energy. Damn O.O

Jacob Collier !!!!!!
2:30 Hi Jacob!
OKG I CANT WAIT FOR SHIRT TO COME OUTT
I’ve just been blessed 🥰
wait but this is exactly how i dance when this song comes on
It is good not to see Sza safe and out of Beyoncé’s basement but I think she is still there in her library. But another update I think she is smoking them mushrooms she is dancing around she is turning into a clown 🤡 with that red hair and old girl is abusing that pole.
*ginger hair sza all the wayy*
Goddess
When Sza said 'feelin like Job when he lost his shit' ,I felt that
"Alice in wonderland but instead, its my legs stuck in a hole ... and also i want to be a stripper reading a book in a library, give some vintage shoots too"
Beautiful🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heavenly Beats!
When the ending song releases that shit will break the charts and the internet oh my god!
she looks great as always
This woman HEALTHY
Anyone else want to try mushrooms after this?
s/o sza
Did SZA strip before or has she just learnt the way of the pole?
WOAH
então a sinopse do clipe é que ela comeu um cogumelo alucinógeno e ficou alucinando??? isso é arte
In Brazil, in March 2021, a Nazi is presiding over this country, purposely spreading covid 19. A genocide please help us !! Stop Bolsonaro !!
Que som meus consagrados !
Purrrr
Good day in my mind asf
i love her
Like a beatiful poison ivy
Does anyone else find this reminiscent of her old sound Country?  Even the music video setting and her mannerisms are like a big budget version of her vision back then. I love it.
watching this and sharting is a mood 🤤☝️
OMG THE SNIPPET IN THE END I'M DYING OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
Why would she tease the song at the end 😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
https://youtu.be/98R60xfPcPk
who's the dude in the tv
fucking POETRY. god she's amazing
If someone decides to reimagine Beauty and the Beast, I cast my vote for SZA as Belle 🌹
sza is literally the definition of being a plantita
SZA's music just takes me on a magical trip, Goddzaamn!!! Feeling lost but I like it!🤍
YESYESYESYES
Psychedelic mkultra gang shit

Rebirth. Entropy. beauty. chaos. Divine Feminine.
QUEEN

shes so majestic
Damn sis.
i get high just by watching this
I hope she doesn’t wait too long to drop this one!!!
ကိုရီးယားကမြန်မာနိုင်ငံသားများကိုထောက်ခံသည်။
NO WAY NO WAY WHAT THE FDMCHUSCFIWEUDSBUISISD
DROP IT NOWWWWWW🥵🥵🥵🥵
Nice song but I don't get/understand the video.
watched this whole thing eyes close o my god
MISS SZA IS A VIBE!!!!!❤️
JESUSSSSS
O MY GOD
I have a theory that we are the evolution of the mushroom.. they control everything ... they speak to us.. show us things.. love this song
My girl sza can't do no wrong
HOLY FUCK
YESSS!!!
I can’t understand half of the words what she said... I’m somehow in a great mood still. I’d say a happy forgettable song/video
this is truly the definition of perfection.
Oi Brasileiros
I am daze. Her moves are beautiful. I did not know she can dance
In a spiritual sense this is a NO NO . Shes out here promoting drugs aka (Shrooms) at the beginning of the music video. and dancing wierdly with that "white" smoke she has going around her. CAREFUL YA'LL to who your watching and listening too. the DEVIL can also disguise himself as an 'angel of light' which is a LIE from the pit of Hell.   May God bless your eyes and ears. in Jesus's Name . Amen.
This woman is perfection and no one can convince me otherwise
Tik tok please don't ruin this one
Jack and Jill ran down the hill-
Reading a book on the pole. Gotta multitask 😌
Why did I get this in my recommended
prettiest music video ive ever seen
IS NOBODY TALKING BOUT THE SNIPPET SONG AT THE END WTF I want that song
https://youtu.be/mZehUIuym8I

I’m 19... please find me Sza I will make you have a better day
Not MS. Sza reality shifting
Yes mushroom sza🍄
The way this unfolds as a story with no spoken word is beautiful.
This is like a kiss it better by Rihanna part 2
Great director
A tripped out contemporary dance in a shroom garden while reading on a pole??? MORE PLEASE!!! #ThatNextTrackTho
Why'd you think of of mushrooms when your high?
Linda música ❤️
Magic mushroom trips be like :
Ok I’m sorry but I couldn’t help but laugh when she started rolling down that hill 😭
Need the full Shirt song 😩😩
Im pretty sure her parents put her in gymnastics or some sort of dance class. However, this video isnt to explicit for my young ones...if, nothing else promotes: Get your body in shape, move and live it healthy..this will do for them. I did like the creative art's in this video!
Whoever disliked this video I’m coming for you
Talented
Okay I need to know badly, what is this song at the end? Don’t tease me like this 😭😭😭
Bugs life vibes💕
Why is she aggressively twearking-😭😭😭
Come on SZA!!!! I’m here for the choreo…this was really dope

Queen
She Better Represent STL Talents 😌🥺🤩
Beyind her eyes vibes 🥰
SZA watchers here is something just for you.  If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, hated, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world.  End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, satan is ruling with his plagues, violence, idol worship, scoffers, and government control... The earth is experiencing birth pains like never before, earthquakes, fires, floods. People now are lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, we see sexual immorality running rampant like adultery, fornication, homosexuality, sexual abuse rape... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), and religious persecution against Christians only (they will hate you because of me, Jesus (Matthew 10:22).  The world leaders are prepping for a,"One-World order," a "Great Reset," (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative, eternity in darkness, suffering in a lake of fire)  Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, the world will be in turmoil, then the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many with his worldwide lies... then the tribulation will start, you will be forced to worship the beast and take his number. Life on earth will be horrific.  Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 10:9), and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace! Ephesians 4:8-9(NOT BY WORKS)
i feel like her music temporarily pulls you out of reality. like my mind just goes to a diff space and then snaps out of it once the song ends lol
This is literally ART...in its purest form
Good days
She’s simply amazing, and her body movements are stress relieving for me😌😌
The song itself doesn't good to me, but i really like the music video. The room with the books really reminds me of the library in the video game ''Fran Bow'' :)
the whole video is just so ethereal
Is there a guide to getting woke like this ?
OMG BB
is it just me or am i just loving the dances ?
no no noooo she put another new song at the end 😩 now we have to wait who knows how long
I just liked the ending
Her voiceeeeeeee
The aura scenes are how I feel when I listen to that song
It’s the demonic symbolism that went over EVERYBODY’S head for me!🙄🤦🏾‍♀️
This what i needed to THRIVE YASSssssSssSss
BRUH
0:12 gave me very much love affair by UMI vibes
I WAS NOT EXPECTING 'SHIRT' AT THE END HOLY SHIT THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
When she started twerking- I laughed 😭 I’m sorry it was just so random
To the streets she shall Return
I like the song but don't really feel like video it just doesn't really do the song Justice to me
the vibes from sza are always the best
she’s a goddess
Yass bitch yass 😍💯💫
Obsessed ✨ she's so amazing
Sees SZA Me: like
SZA STILL TRYING TO BE RELEVANT😂😂😂😂
when this song came out the girl I was messing with had covid & this shit had her lit asf through her lil quarantine... we don’t fw eachother anymore but this videos trending now i’m watching it sad 🥲
2:21   When she rolled down the hill, I thought she hurt herself.😦😦😦
I’ll be here every day for the ending.  ☺️🤩🥰
The message behind her songs and videos especially this one✊🏾😩🤎
i will now the greatest day .
I understand every part of this master visual piece you so exquisitely put together. Literally my spirit animal
Drake hit that already
I would love for Sza , and Jhene Aiko to make a song I fell like it would be so spiritual 😌
SZA With These 💦😩

https://youtu.be/Fng7iO6VCNk
it’s her world and we’re living in it.
Lembrei do curupira, ta linda.
So are we all as a collective equally salty that Shirt isn’t a full song 🙃 damn 😩💕
Omg! This video is so graceful and calming. I was so excited the whole video 😌
I’m embarrassed to see that my party clearly cheated to get Biden into office. Why are the Democrats  ok with the level of fraud our party committed?!? Now look, we have a demented old man in the most powerful single office in the USA. Forcing Biden to partake in this scheme borders elderly abuse. As a clinician I have a responsibility to report this abuse. Sad!
Wheres the rest of shirtless please
Reading never looked so sexy..... I'll join her book club! 💋
I miss the pre-covid days #gooddays
❤ 🇧🇷 ❤
Shes fabulous frl💫💙
Wait so “shirt” has to be released or that’s it
Oh my gawd.
Best song to vibe too
see.. this is why I'm so gay-                    so gay and proud :>

I was not expecting her to add that song in the end. I loved this whole music video each part of it. </3
If there is a new album coming, I AM READY FOR IT!!!!!
video left me looking for answers. Did she dance in her pass? why is she so good at dancing and how long did it take to film this?
OMG she's so amazing ❤️❤️❤️😭
OK that’s enough music videos for this song! 😂
She has very big lips
Ummm I’m in love with this video
That gas was expensive as hell
moment of silence for the people who can’t find this song😔
tornado sza tornado sza tornado sza tornado sza tornado sza
Whoever loves this girl leave a like to see how many we are.

SZA songs are always a vibe🤗🤗🤗
I ALREADY LOVE THE SONG SHIRT
Sza’a music makes me feel at peace and like nothing can touch me in this moment, that’s what I love about her music, for me and maybe many others it’s like an escape from reality where you can express and be yourself, and I’m so grateful for that ❤️
Im 15 and I just finished writing my first official song but I’m REALLY bad at the instruments/ beats part. I uploaded it to YouTube so it would be cool if you guys told me what you think

When you thought your day couldn’t get any better:
SZA should be the president of good vibes
I wasn't expecting this for the video
Is she really Muslim, wears a hairdress, and she is on a stripper pole.  Hmmm I dont know about that. To each his own I guess.
I will now have thee best life thanks to this song love you SZA 💚💚💚💚
We been waiting on this Sza 💜

🤍🤍🤍

This is bussin

Nobody: SZA: dancing aggressively  with mushrooms
slayed as always 😍
REPENT and be BORN AGAIN, BELIEVE ON THE MESSIAH LORD JESUS NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE, SEEK FOR YOURSELVES and you SHALL FIND.  ⚠️❤️John 3:3 unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. Luke 13:3 unless you repent you will all likewise perish
This video is peaceful

10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. The hardness of butter is directly proportional to the softness of the bread. 2. The last thing on earth you want to do will be the last thing you do. 3. Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else get your way. 4. If ignorance is bliss, then tourists are in a constant state of euphoria. 5. If at first you don't succeed, don't try skydiving. 6.

Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk? 10. What happens if you get scared half to death twice?   Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you want on your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus, but as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce, with the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on but, that's even worse. The post went live at 11:38PM on July 16 and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. at least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at @. 3 minutes later, at @, the Burger King branch address was posted, with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And 3 minutes later, at @, a link was posted. Bk's "Tell Us About US" online form. The foot photo otherwise known as Exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said, "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery, Solved, by 4chan, now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.
shes a genius really

I know life is hard but don’t give up! The truth is God loves you so much that he sent his begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to pay the full price of our sins. To be saved from dying in your iniquities you must call upon his name,confess him as Lord,believe God raised him from the dead,and repent.God bless y'all!💝

Patiently waiting for her next album 🥺
YESSSSSSSSS
She's an actual mushroom shedding out spores. They have very short lives so it fits the theme of living in the present.
Between the song, her beauty, her grace, I’m in tears rn
this is so amazing i—
And she ate it without crumbs
So beautiful 🦋
I’m having a big episode of depression medicated right know and sza it’s helping me to get out of there, hopefully sooner I can find those happy feelings again...
wish i married to her
Same like song from rich brian
Love Jacob Collier’s face on the little green TV bringing in that harmony
This song is such a mood! ❤️❤️❤️
That opening dancetro everything
I'm her biggest fan  I really love her so much no one understands 💕💕 in the bottom of my heart of the inside 💝 the ways she shines like I'm crying right now

You’re so unbelievably beautiful
Sza looks like Winx Club’s Aisha
I feel like for the longest our generation was lacking an artist to really connect to. Someone we really can identify with. Idk what it is about Solana but my Scorpio Rising feels every single word she’s written. This women has some of the most beautiful writing in the music industry today & she’s just so wise beyond her years. SZA if you see this thank you for sharing your art w/ us. We all out here healing & we damn sure could use some Good Days in our minds. 💗🌱🥺
Coming out that hole when the Shrooms hit is everything!!! Ego  death Ego Death Ego Death 💀
I LOVE HER SO MUCH

I literally love how the video switches in and out of different filters. She is the definition of good vibes and aesthetic
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ankh tree of Life 🧬👍🏾💯🎶 confirmation 😁♏👼🏾 culture leader helping humanity and underdogs confidence ✅🏁
But that last part of the video just teased us so good with new music . Just like she did on hit different. Thank you SZA for letting us in and letting us feel something different in these times. Know you’ve affected me Deeply. Thank you
im gonna tell my kids this was mother nature
Fada da natureza ❤

This song is different for me not sure I like it. But I support SZA at all costs. That song at the end THOUGH SHEEESH
Sza is so sexy she doesn’t have to try it’s there , it’s magnetic and it’s alluring 😍
Pole dancing is such art I'm always impressed by its beauty 💛💛
yaaaaaaaaaas queen
OMGGGG
SZA my birthday twin. I love you😢
OH MY GOD
Tropico vibes 💛💛
👨🏼‍🍳😘
when I think it’s not possible to love her more, she pops out of the ground like a mushroom goddess and dances in mycelium pants
so annoying!
SZA is so underrated. It was her on the pole KILLING IT reading a book like sis!!!!! She knew what we wanted and gave! Ate and left no crumbs!!!   Much love from a small youtuber, keep killing it beautiful!
3:15
VISUALS FOR DAYS
YUP YUP YUP
Love the song but the video 😂😂
amooooo
actual queen shit 😍🤍
Much respect 🙌🏿 super unique idea
What is the name of the second song?
That was so enjoyable to watch and hear
I want her so bad!!!
Ugh 😍
this video makes no sense but I still love sza lol
I think its dope how this song was already stuck in my mind because it plays at the end of the "Hit Different" video. It almost felt like an interlude... or a complete switch-up that was part of how "Hit Different" ends. One song, completely different arrangements. Artists are doing that a lot nowadays... complete switch-ups in the same song. I Love the creativity that SZA brings. Sonically... visually. She's dope. In an era where so many artists sound like one another... its always great to see a real one breakthrough and put some real art in front of the masses. Her melodies are never forced... never feels like she's tryna write a HIT... nothing is too neat or manufactured. She's mastered the art of improv'ing / adlibbing melodies... sounds like she records the first melodies that hit her as she's jamming / vibing to the music... those natural melodies are usually not what gets kept... usually a writer has to adjust or tweak them to sound how they want... but her natural vibe is dope enough to vibe to. When you mesh that with the right production, it just makes the music addictive without being overly repetitive. I Love it. SZA is a whole vibe and a half. Great artist.
KILL ME I LOVE U
OH MY GOD
Sza said I'm here to remind the children what no bleaching and natural bodies was all about, she said I'm giving the girls Iman in "Remember the Time" Naomi Cambell in that legendary Michael Jackson video👸🏿🧚🏿‍♀️👍🏿!
THE END SONG OMG IM EXCITED

killin yoga refs. beautiful mv. also, this song peaceful
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
MULHER PERFEITAAAAAAA BR
YES YES YES
She really said I can be the sexiest while still being literate.
This is giving me Alice in the wonderland, Poison Ivy and Behind Her Eyes.

She takes shrooms for those who don't know. I'm sending love to all people here in Jesus christ name. I don't take shroom or drugs or weed anymore. But I am a Christian and have faith in christ. I hope everyone goes to Heaven. Thats my desire for all people.   Be aware for Satan.  He exists , he can fool us easily. You can disagree, understand it's all love. I love you all It's only right if I speak about christ I speak about sin thats why I say beware the devil is out to trick us.
she loves mushrooms ig

i love love love the fairycore aesthetic of the mv
"I pretend shit just didn't happen"  Omg that's how I feel about every person I've ever dated.
Now you're just flexing
iconic
TELITOBBIES LOOKING OUTSIDE THERE WINDOW RN 😈🥵🤜🏿
WOW! ART
Goes back to her Broken Clocks influences of feeling rendered hopeless to her ideals in an effort to escape the desires of proclaimed consummation.  "Runnin' back to the strip club I'm never going back, never going back No you can't make me Never going back, never going back (Nah) They never take me (Yeah)"
RENT WAS DUE
That´s my fav song ❤️ love ist so muuuuuccchhhh
This Woman is art 🦋
4:30 and thank you
yes
This is my third time coming back here today
I just know SZA was a beautiful siren in her past life I just know it
It’s like I don’t want Shirts to finish
If mother nature was a person
Is that Jacob collier?
🥺🥺🥺
This is crazy, I had this song stuck in my head all day yesterday, I didn't even know they were dropping this that day.
Omg😍😍
que música meu povo, que música
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍄🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*this song is my aesthetic*
Eu Amoo essa música💜💜💜💜🎶🎶🎶🎶
*i swear that i won’t get bored of this song never ever*
*i believe that when the world will end someday i will have this song in my mind*
In the 24hrs this video been up I watched over 10 times and showed 10 people
icon
if u disliked this i hope ur phone only charges at a certain angle
the way she started the teaser at 4:20... ain't no coincidence if you ask me
sza is literally the definition of mother nature
So we gone get a video break down or naw. Where my tuned in folk at
SZA gotta stop teasing us like this
love it just love it
Excuse me? Why am I crying, singing, smiling and getting it in one song? SZA is a blessing. This is art ❤️
how could you even dislike this tune, 1.5k ppl you really must be sad
WHEN SHE AGRESSIVELY WAS TWERKING
And we finally got a music video 🥰
🥰
❤ ha
I thought she said she was done with music after her first album? Like girl go back to not releasing, thanks
🦋Absolute ✨ART✨💅🏻🦋
I now believe pole dancing is a skill every artist should have :)
Sza.... imma need you to put the extended version out too and not just for the music videos 😭
lmao 0:59 was used a meme ahahah anyway great song
This reminds me of sana with orange hair from more&more MV
I just got chills 🥰

Definition of art.
SZA MAMA I FUCKING LOVE YOUUU U SPOILING US RN 🥺🥺🥺😭😭

I think I just ascended watching this music video
Didn't even listen to lyrics, got caught up in the rhythm and music! Very dreamy and atmospheric
are you kidding me? she knows how to pole dance too? uffpphfhhhffff
This made me kind of uncomfortable. I guess the whole thing was a little unsettling. Especially her movements when in the forest/mushroom scene haha. And the cuts to the low res camera. She talented tho😅
2:22 me after 8 exams, 2 presentations and one thesis
The starting instrumental gives me goosebumps everytime  🤔😆
SHE ABOUT TO DROP "SHIRT" HOLY SHIT
If you're British you know this gives in the night garden vibes
She should make a song with kali
Sza is her own aesthetic.
Sza> anything else
Girl how can someone be THIS talented?
This song is so underrated 🥲
Yessss queen always with the alien shit we love it 😍😍
Directed by Solana....yea girl we can tell 🤭
I cannot wait to hear "shirt"

BODIEDD THAT ❤️
SZA serving us being the *Mother Nature × Educated Pole Dancer.*
OMG! I love the vibes ✨❤
She's so cute 😭
Video has nothing to do with the song but OK she does sound lovely and she looks beautiful 🙏🏾🙌🏾
BYEEEEEEE SO GOODD
I love you!!!💘
Anyone here took magic mushrooms or  truffles ? Or ego death?
This is beautiful and more beautiful when you burn a spliff
I LOVE ALL OF IT. FINALLY, some imagination.Good job Sza. Show 'em
She did that 🍃🔥
🥰🥰🥰
THE SHIRT IN THE ENDDDD!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What is the song at the end? Did she ever make it full?
i'm screenshotting the fuck out of this
im healing
she is a literal godsend
💜💜💜
Lacks annunciation, droopy jawed singing. Understood about 15% of the words
UMMM... how ICONIC
She’s like a strong feminine woman that’s has strength in an all feminine way ? in my opinion, if that makes sense . Usually you here woman talkin bout being strong but they take on masculine characteristics or try to be gangsta and hard, ain’t nothin rough or hard about Sza, she looks soft and durable as a fluffy pillow 😘, even when she all covered in tomboy attire (not in this vid) it’s never boyish ? Lol at who I’m gonna offend....
😍
😭❤️❤️
Guys we're so blessed
Feel like the mix isnt the same as the one on the 'Hit Different' change up...it sounds too diluted...that version sounds amazing this mix sounds crap and has lost alot of its richness...i dont like it at all...if you gon release something make it better...this sounds horrid
MY RELIGION 😩‼️
Is Solana Solange?
imagine being this beautiful, talented, smart, (insert a million more positive traits) 🥺
Bro is Sza human?😭😍
Hobbits love this video.
SHE FED THE CHILDREN
Get your I was defiantly hear before tic tok tickets.
she’s amazing 🥺
I... I hope she’ll accept my proposal💍🙇🏾‍♂️🤎
Breathtaking. I’m at a loss for words this is beyond gorgeous!!! 💗💕
Akhirnya ada mv✨
Yo this woman is soo Talented but the fact that she uses backward dance and revers Lyrics that her soul leaves her body make me dont listen to her songs and watch her vids she put spells on people...
Can’t believe Jacob’s on this 🔥🔥
Shout out to Jacob Collier doing the background vocals 🔥
I saw this while listening to good days 😭😭 on Spotify and scrolling down YouTube
If I wasn’t sober, I’d eat shrooms and enjoy this video in its entirety, over and over
this healed me
Yeahh, i love this video 🔥
She speaks to my soul❤❤❤
Cant wait shirt song🎉🎉🎉
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
Voce😇😇😇😇😇
I did not know she was 30 she looks 19 wtfff

This is perfect, thank you mama 😭❤️✨
She really pulled off the pole dancing.
👍👍👍
Just a personal reminder 4:30
I wanna take some ayahuasca and listen to this!
The gas station is her ending her shrooms trip with a nice blunt ( because she smoking that gas...)
It’s giving very much dancing dolls lol
i really, really, really needed that.
MARAVILHOSA 😩❤❤
2:41 - 2:45 ok miss queen of contemporary 😍😍😍😍
“Half of us us chasin fountains of youth and it’s in the present, now”
The aesthetic is everything😩

Beautiful
Imagine how many people are listening to this song with you🙃

The fact that I can get tired of this song since release..😊
2:20 me after hearing Jacob Collier in the background

I love you my Scorpio queen you will soon get the love you deserve ok ?? ❤️❤️❤️
SHIT. THE POWER.
Godess
Nobody : Sza : ⤵️↔️⤴️↪️↘️🔂🔀🔄
The video shows her on shrooms and how it freed her mind from the darkness and brought out her best qualities .
When Ariana said god is a woman.... she meant sza 😍
Very different
This is amazing
Is it just me or does the beat remind yall of the boy playing drums from the movie Vampire Dog
Sza is the queen of post-credit next songs and I’m not complaining 🙌🏼
im literally on shrooms right now trippin to this song lolll
Lyrics     You gotta roll with it You gotta take your time You gotta say what you say Don't let anybody get in your way 'Cause it's all too much for me to take Don't ever stand aside Don't ever be denied You wanna be who you'd be If you're coming with me I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I'm gonna take me away and hide I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide I know the roads down which your life will drive I find the key that lets you slip inside Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door But you know I think I recognize your face But I've never seen you before You gotta roll with it You gotta take your time You gotta say what you say Don't let anybody get in your way 'Cause it's all too much for me to take I know the roads down which your life will drive I find the key that lets you slip inside Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door But you know I think I recognize your face But I've never seen you before You gotta roll with it You gotta take your time You gotta say what you say Don't let anybody get in your way 'Cause it's all too much for me to take Don't ever stand aside Don't ever be denied You wanna be who you'd be If you're coming with me I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
God she is so stunning
sza vibin to her own song is SO ICONIC
I love SZA voice so much  I just love the melancholy aspect 😪
a spiritual experience
Is she on acid? Cause this how it feels, looks, tastes, smells like 😅
The comfort this gives me
SOLANA 🤍🤍🤍🤍
SZA WACK
Not enough ppl are talking about 4:47 and I need you to bc THAT SHIT WAS ACTUALLY FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. I legit gasped and maybe got teary eyed, lets talk about it ❤
This song is a dream and so is she ✨💜🌊
that library tho.....
this is video is literal artwork.
currently waiting for blood stain😩.
this music video feels so spiritual in the way her aura swirls around her as she dances and expresses herself- just a sense of coming back to one's self after a heartbreak. the scenes where she's reading a book whilst twirling on the pole is such a serious flex to her physicality and grace- I can tell that dancing is a very important element in her self-expression and identity. SZA is definitely on a different path mentally, physically, and musically. I'm excited to see more of her project.
Them Shrooms will have you like that .. each time 🍄
beautiful
She just never miss! 😭🔥
Always find myself not wanting her videos to end 😩 we need a visual/mini film bc I can’t get enough of her artistic abilities
A stripper pole in a library is just about the trashiest thing I've ever seen.
YESSSSSSSSSS
Love it 😀.
ugh im in love
I blast this on a daily
Yooooo that titan steam kinda sus 😳
a star :)
this fed me for a year thank you
I'm sorry did that say 4.39 for gas

The instrumental says it all.

Her Best Work to date
Nice visuals and moves 🔥

Jacob Collier sent me here
This is my first time watching a video all the way through before looking at the comments.. she is so stunning I am truly at a loss for words😍😍 A true ANGEL 🔥
RELEASE 👏🏾 THE 👏🏾 DAMN 👏🏾 SONG 👏🏾
Imagine a Lofi rapper on this like tyler and another singer. I think there's too much and little to no potential of enhancement with a remix at the same time
I could literally watch this video all day. It makes me feel like “I wish I were there 🥺”
It felt so peaceful  watching this
We don’t deserve her , your amazing babygirl 🖤
Cant wait for the next song🥳
Peep how she added a scorpion in the beginning 🦂 ♏️🤘🏼 #scorpiogang   Love you Solana 😌✨
Throw back sound.  Nice
Why am I crying this is literally perfection
Poor grass
1:15 I’m sorry I couldn’t hold in the laughter

pole dancing in a library...Yes
There are no words. Only tears 😭 omgggg this is too good. I’m sobbing.

SHE IS A VISIONARY
WE WINNIN YALL
4:42 which song

Sza looks so cute 😝
Da bestttt
Why this scene looking like the scene from Alice in wonderland?? The one where the book worm is smoking on the dirt pile ????
Fire,  Love, this song...

This mv is strangely addictive  Im in love
I came here for jacob collier❤
GODDESS
GODDESS! ✨🥺 so perfect, the vibes !! I keep getting chills! Can’t wait for the album
THANK YOU NOW PLEASE RELEASE SHIRT
I liked the song until I saw this video and heard the very end, which is filthy. The entire video is subliminal messaging of a stripper being on a drug trip, trashy and just bizarre. It’s just disturbing that young people watch and listen to this garbage. No thanks ✌️
This album going to be so fire breh
The way Sza has been showing out with theses songs omg i love her she’s so beautiful and the lyrics the voice the visuals so versatile
SEE I JUST KNEW THIS SONG WAS SO AESTHETIC IT WAS GUNNA HAVE THIS TYPE OF VIDEO I JUST KNEW IT-
Y pa cuando la nueva canción?????????
<3
QUEEN 👑👑👑👑
A FUCKING PRINCESS . QUEEN. A FAIRY. UUGHFHBENZBSHA
PLEASEEEE COLLAB WITH JHENE ... THE VIBES ARE SO FUCKIINNN REAL AND ALKKE I LOVE YALL
Can we appreciate her level of advance dance throughout the whole video. She touched ballet. With a mix of hip hop dance. Even the pole wasn't your typical "pole dancing". It had more of a gymnastics approach. Amazing.
I like the song but the video does no justice to the art portrayed in my mind. Nothing abstract about it. just looked like they filmed SZA while she was high af wylin out. She’s sexy af but the video sucked
I’m just waiting for the next song at the end music video...or should I say visual art. Ik the choreography gonna slap
Thank god for Artist like Sza only 21 but love good R&B
w
TikTok? 4:32 your welcome ☺️
I know thats righttt 🥵
I DONT MISS NO EX, I DONT MISS NO TEXT!
I worry there's no LP and you don't care, not trynna be nuisance it's just urgent
Wait so is the ending part of this song or is a teaser for a full song to come?
Queen of good vibea
YES MS GURL
BRO WHEN I HEARD THE BEAT AT THE ENDDD I STARTED SCREAMINGGGGG😭😭😭😭
2:12 me when my foot falls asleep
This is art bye 🥰
https://youtu.be/1SmAiHRjdDQ❤️
Omg

Black Scarlet Witch! She’s astral projecting
Alice and the Wonderland inspired for sure.
another blessing
Tf is this?
In 4 years this is gonna be a Classic, trust me.
WE DO NOT DESERVE SZA I REPEAT WE DO NOT DESERVE HERRRR 😍😍😍😍
This is beautiful 🤍
Who else loves the whole song but came to skip to the ending song 😭
NOT ME DOING THE TIK TOK DANCE IN THE END😭😭😭CHILE
This video is exuding Pisces vibess ugh I love her
She looked bare when she swung around that pole like no drawls
this is beautiful *rewatches*
HEAT
I just absolutely love everything about her.
💕
Babe ...whats this
OMG THIS VIDEO IS EVERYTHING

So I'm not alone this cured my anxiety to.
I'm very very sorry for laughing at when you were spinning in circles

It's giving hunny. It's giving everything and more
i’m sorry y’all but this music video makes no sense ... like what’s the story she’s trying to show us here she’s just dancing -
FINALLY WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS-

If SZA appeared on P-Valley's stripper pole Uncle Clifford would never have to worry about paying another bill.  That place would be packed for months even if entry cost the same amount as Hamilton orchestra seats.
Do you know what is even better than Good Days, Great Days
I just know when this album is released, streaming platforms are going to CRASH!!!!!!!!!!!
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23). Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42) You will have to face God on Judgement Day.  Will you go to Heaven or Hell? Here’s a quick test:  1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)  2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)  3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)  4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.  5.Honor your father and mother.  6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).  7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).  8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).  9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).  10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)  James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”   The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.  If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)  God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because your Good but because God is rich in mercy.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)  Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.  Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.  Pray something like this:  "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."

Porque YHWH amou o mundo de tal maneira que deu o seu Filho unigênito, para que todo aquele que nele crê não pereça, mas tenha a vida eterna. - João 3:16 Não pense que eu vim destruir a lei ou os profetas: não vim destruir, mas cumprir.	 		  Pois em verdade vos digo que, até que o céu e a terra passem, um jota ou um til não passará da lei de maneira alguma, até que tudo seja cumprido.		 		  Aquele, pois, que violar um destes mandamentos, e assim ensinar aos homens, será chamado o menor no reino dos céus, mas aquele que os praticar e ensinar -lhes , esse será considerado grande no reino dos céus. – Mateus Cap 5				 não importa o que vc já tenha feito o sacrificio do messias te torna totalmente limpo quando vc aceita o messias como seu senhor vc ganha total a cesso ao céu existe um plano especifico para vc preparado por Deus se vc tem alguma dúvida disso faça um teste simples peça para Deus mesmo te mostrar que Ele existe e te ama

i've been waiting for this for a loong time
. the ending 🤽🏿‍♀️🌹💖
A guy slept off while waiting for   his roommate,  he  keeps late  at  night.  As  he  tried turning  around, a huge dark figure with flamy eyes opened his door, he wanted to scream but all strength was gone.  Was it a dream or vision? He  cannot  tell.  It stared deep into his eyes and handed him a letter, he opened it....... Dear Jude, I couldn't make it home last night because I died. I thought life after death is an elusion but  I am here lonely and always  afraid in Pains and in torments the Torture is unending, I cannot explain it,  but  I am dying a thousand times in a second,, You never told me this place was for  real  and  how to avoid it..  We  grew up together,  went to school  together  and  did everything  in common but you never told me about  this  New life of yours.   I asked you severally and you jokingly pushed it aside. I was a good  man  with  a  charitable  heart but  that  all  didn't  count here.  The angel told me,  I  am without  Christ and  my  Name  is not in the  Book  of  life.  I asked you yesterday  morning, what  is  this born  again,?  and  you  said  nothing About  New  Life  Christ,    I  Am  in great  Pains,  and  Torment can you hear the screams,,  the torments of the great and the less,   I  was  told  it is for eternity.. You betrayed our friendship,  you never told me sex was fornication but you cautioned me against AIDS,  you never told me getting high was drunkenness, you just told me not to drink and drive,  you never told me lying was sin,  all you just said was don't be caught.  I hate you  for this....  aaaahhh h.....aaahhhh....aaa am dying again here,  but  Im alive, the flames keeps getting hotter.    I wish you were here.. You deceived  me  to  the  end. If  you  had  told  me babout Jesus  Christ  and  Salvation  I  knew  I couldn't  be here,  for  eternity..   I died only a few hours  ago, I was drunk and ran into a pole but it seems I have been here for how many  years  already. Please tell my family and  all  our friends  about  Salvation.  I  Am dying again  but  death  wont come.. Its me,  Henry. He  woke up  at  about 2:45AM with  a  banging headache  and  his  phone started  ringing,   he picked it up and what he heard Scared him to his bones. "Hello, Henry is dead"..  Today is still another opportunity to tell someone very dear to you about Jesus Christ and His  Saving grace.  I  just  told  you  because  I  will  never  want  you to end up  in   HELL,,  Too..  HAVE YOU TOLD SOMEONE ABOUT JESUS,  EVERY DAY,? HIS SAVING GRACE,  and  NEW LIFE  IN  CHRIST JESUS.?  U can copy, share and paste in other group chats PLEASE,,  GOD, will help us in this race in the Almighty Name of Jesus....   You might not be able to go around evangelising but you can just share this to caution someone. Do it if you want to..
you served so much sis we dont deserve you 🥺♥️

I thought her wig was gonna fly off when she was shaking her head. It’s on there good.
Just plain nice!!! Thank you SZA!!!
Not my kind of artist. I feel bad musicians have been narrowed to those who are willing to strip.  This sends a bad message to little ones of what a woman is, what beauty.
I Love This Video 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
AND THE PREVIEW YALL-
Love this 🤩❤️
Lyrics these.  Learn from your mistakes Ini. Don’t let snakes take advantage Ini.  Don’t waist your time on a liar or cheat. Bright days will soon come.  #Trust #Ex #Snake

Alice in wonderland vibes ✨✨
I just love this wonderful masterpiece 🙏🏽❤️
I’ve been waiting so long for this video. 😭😭😭 ❤️
I too love mushrooms
Well she's good 😍
I wish I could like this a million times 😪
Just realize the mf song ugh i hate you
An icon. This. Is. Art.
Thematically appropriate visuals! 🔥
🎵🎵🎵
Am i wrong or this song was different yesterday
If she is doing this as an album concept where she releases every track like a single and teases the next in the end of every video, I will absolutely die. I wouldn’t be surprised. She continually finds ways to remain an artists on the frontlines.
Heat. Period.
THE AESTHETIC IN THIS VIDEO IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE BRO 😭
omg yes pls .
What’s the second song at the end ?!?!?!?!!,!,!?!,
Where might I locate a library that has a pole in it...
I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS THIS IS SO GOOD
Beautiful work on this music video SZA and others who made it! ❤️
how much did the director smoke while shooting?
PURRRRR
I STARTED SCREAMING WHEN THE SONG CHANGED TO SHIRT OH MY GOD
OMG BESTIEE YOU FINALLLY MADE AN OFFICIAL VIDEOEOEOEOE
There aren’t enough abstract music videos like this. We need more
I CAN'T WAIT FOR BLOODSTAIN
period bae you look so pretty wth
Why does every female singer these days feel the need to be half naked in their music videos?
weird asf but like in the best way 🙄
bae
ENGLISH VERSION PLEASE ❤️
of course it includes racist lyrics.  obviously artist is so smart she couldn't help it and had to add racism because  . . .  of no actual reason
Now this is a certified hood classic
Damn its the pole scenery for meee
I love mushrooms ( not the drugs 😅) They're cute
Ok because my wife killed it 💞
3:13 why sza WHY
wtf am i even watching ☠️ i'm sorry what is this
So you telling my I need to hit the shrooms and then pop this video.
Love this song, Sza is so talented ❤️
"I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened"🎧
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm tripping out on this lol 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful🦄
This shit fire asf!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏽😌
The twerking didn’t fit w the song either that or she can’t dance lmao but I love the song
Thank u queen
I’m having a bad day but now that I watched this it made my day better thank you sza
i was once a broke bitch then i watched this and now i’m a millionaire
And as she should
I was having sucha bad day today this made it so much better
Beautiful woman but can we please stop promoting drugs like real talk. Making drugs look pretty and esthetic is soooo, just so lame man. And this song had good verses, she really could’ve created something meaningful. I’m just underwhelmed. I want art that touches my soul, it’s pretty women everywhere this all we get? And before anyone come for me, this her art I know she can do what she want. I’m just venting cause I’m disappointed. This type of art is not going to change the world. Nobody is going to be telling their generations about this, 2 things I feels she’s capable of doing.
ate everything on the table
Quem é Solana? para o perdido o caminho para a escuridao a luz para o doentea a cura para mim? tudooooooooooooooooooo

I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!  No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ.  We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness.  And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John   ♥️🇺🇸🤍🇺🇸💙🇺🇸

The greatest man in history is Jesus.  He had no servants, yet they called him master.  He had no degree, yet they called him teacher.  He had no medicines, yet they called him healer.He had no army, yet kings feared him.He won no military battles, yet he conquered the world.He committed no crime, yet they crucified him.He was buried in a tomb,  Yet He lives Today. Jesus is ALIVE!! And He is offering the free gift of salvation. Do you want to be saved? Then say this prayer:   "Lord Jesus Christ, Have mercy on me, I'm a sinner,  forgive me my sins, Cleanse me from my iniquities, I believe You died for me, And today, I forsake all my sin,  I forsake devil and the world, I enter into the kingdom God, In Jesus name Amen".  You have know been saved! Now spread the good news!

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too.

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
wow
Thanks Sza🤧
Can someone please leave the lyrics?
Sexy wild and free. She is at one with the earth in a psychedellic trip.
how can one be so perfect?
😍
why this give me the chills holy fuck
I love Sza’s tone and voice, but I feel like if you can’t understand the words of what some one is saying be careful it’s no telling what your loving or think your listening too and her dances look like she’s calling on something...
I believe this album will really cement her as a superstar and music industry force....Also she better give me contemporary dance choreography and is even pointing her feet. It makes me love her even more than I already did lol.
oh hey i was just looping this song
Wow
SZA is such a weirdo.....I love weirdos😍
i clicked too fast i thought it said "abra"

My damn SOUL NEEDED THIS TODAY. THANK YOU SIS ❤️💚💜

SZA ft. Rihanna one day ⚡

I don’t get the music video at all. I feel like her music vid should of been with like happy monsters butterflies ladybugs and then when it gets to the sexual parts she can do her stripper dancing and her gymnastics and the other things
ITS GIVING EVERYTHING THEY SAID IT WOULD GIVE 🤪🔥
I just hope she won't make us wait so long like we have been waiting for good days after she put the snippet on hit different.
OMGGGGGGGGGGG
Yeah cuz you was playin making us wait
Why take life in our own hands when we could let go of everything and trust God? Living for pleasure and gain doesn’t matter since death and time erases all your hard work. It’s all meaningless. Of course, if we don’t believe in God, whether we live an honest life or not would also be meaningless (Be of no consequence). Now if you take into consideration that there’s over 2 billion people on earth making their claims that God is real, would you gamble with your life the same way you would with money? Truly, it’s only when you believe in God, does one’s life become meaningful. Simply because it now means there will be consequences for your actions. I say this to you, not to force anything on you, but to encourage you to at least do your own research. Don’t gamble with your life.  - William  John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Song is shit
why would anyone dislike this???

Solana. I NEED the next song released immediately.
The truth about viruses: Truth is self evident, when we hide the truth our lies become convoluted. Viruses are a product of the Earths ecological cycles. They regulate the planets ecosystems and evolve life forms. The Earth also produces Humans. Human populations are also regulated by the planet in order to maintain our ecosystems. Vaccines are not naturally occurring they don’t adapt and change like our bodies immune system and some people only care about getting rich.
i love this so much

Oh my god. That’s it. Oh my god
SZA why... WHY TF IS SHIRT 30 SECONDS LONG
Yes SZA better come through with all the Visuals!!! Period!!💕😍🔥😜
*this nature vibe--*
LOVING the imagery of her reading while pole dancing. As women we're so conditioned to think that being sexually liberated and intellectual are mutually exclusive to one another and that these mindsets are against each other.  And along with that, displaying the beauty of both wild and delicate femininity. She's such a goddess 🙌
Like beat.    Hey.
THIS IS THE BEST SONG EVER!!!        *Searches for a 1 hour version *
This feels like watching a video of the inside of my soul
😍😍😍😍😍
Who disliked this? i just wanna talk.
Time for tiktokers to steal this one 😂🤣

This song will always hold a place in my heart because it made me realize how many days I’ve wasted on people and that to just live in the good days in my life and mind.💕✨

One word *ethereal*
Idk what's more beautiful. SZA or SZA's voice
MASTERPIECE *hits replay repeatedly*
SZA is a good singer. These cheap ass videos singing on all fours & some girl  pole dancing...you're better than that. Leave that kind of videos to the less talented that need the attention
BABAAYYYY 💆🏻‍♀️💕
Stop playing with us I can’t wait for corncrap to be over cause I need a concert like a year ago
Girl release shirt pleaseeeeeee!!! You got my back with good days. But I need ya to release shirt to take it offff
Did that gas say 4 dollars wth I’ll surely be walking everywhere respectfully
So is this gonna be her new thing for this album? Giving us sneak peeks of the next song at the end of the videos? Cuz im here for it
This shit is horrible. Let’s get some new and different content creatives going TDE . Like wtf.
The beginning gave Nicki Minaj anaconda video 😂
I like her
YES
Mama learned every trick ! 💞
THE DAY THAT I SEE HER IN CONCERT 🙌🏼🙌🏼...
This shit sucks!! Like all her music 🙄

She be brave
Oh My God I was fascinated! Like I could not look away!!!! SHE IS SOOOOO TALENTED AND MULTIFACETED !! What a f*cking QUEEN!!!!
Her vision of art  is  so magical✨
She reminded me of the princess selenia in the movies arthur 😭
they cut out the jacob's part at the end?!!!!!!!! :(
And she’s BACK!!!! 😩💖💦✨ everything was so beautiful, full of nature, and sexy appeal yasss!!!!
Thoughts...   Sza in shape, shape and has skills on the pole. Sza showing off her dance moves....didn't know. Ok, she is a stripper but she's into reading....the dualities...ha ha. Also, I thought Sza said she was done with making music?
I make music videos as well. One day ima make a song with SZA!!
i was more hype for the preview of Shirt , this was fireeeeeee
SZA DID THAAAAAAAAT 👏🏽😭❤️
OMG😩😭😍
NO WAYYYY
a MAMÃE nunca erra vey 😍

GURLLLL THAT PREVIEW OH MY FUCKING GOD.
I'm literally inlove with this woman😭
Jesus died for our sins, and lived the life we couldn’t. Anyone who acknowledges that they are a sinner, recognizes that Jesus died on the cross and rose 3 days later, and truly accepts Him as Lord and savior, will be saved. Repent & Live for Him, He loves you and He is coming soon 😁💕.
SZA can't make one bad song really, I love this! Solana did an AWESOME job with the music video too!
The next song PERIODT 😌
Cadê os brasileiros?

My therapy🥰🙈
https://youtu.be/1aQUU7uUijo
Pole dancing and reading...just discovered my new fetish.
if this isn’t me at the library i don’t want it
I wonder if she knows how many people want to grow up and be like her
Everything this woman touches/creates is gold.
THE VISUALS!!!

Ive never been a fan of when she just goes full stream of consciousness lyrics. This sounds like shes just rambling over music.
YES YES YES OHMY GOD

this is the exact aesthetic i imagined for the SONGGG!
Yesss the preview finallyyyyy😭
Oh the mushrooms is a metaphor. Who woulda thunk haha
🛐🛐🛐
you so i so you so 😩😩😩
wow just wow
I knew it was Mr.Jacob C at the end of the song!!!! Lovin Sza
Drake, Bruno, SZA ,G-herbo, Selena ,Justin all over the trending page I love it🙌🙌
👎🏾Conceptually the video is quite disappointing. I was expecting something a little more epic.
💕💯🔥🌹😘
her music makes me feel soo calm
It’s Jacob casually vibin on the tv for me
It’s a whole esthetic🔥😍
what's with all the teasin', release the songs already !! 😤😤

Wtf SZA!!??? We want the Full audio to "shirt" 🤬 plz!!! 🥺
If you ever do remix of this definitely Jhené or Giveon
WHEWWW THE NEW SONG AT THE END
Anyone else notice the "Self" at the pumps in the gas station, in the outro? I see that as she's using that setting + pole dancing  as a metaphor for trying to achieve self-love (i.e. "gassing" herself up). Ugh,  I love her!
This is so beautiful to watch fr
The fact that sza is still doing good 👌🌟
mushroom fairy queen 💖🥺🥺
I love the ctrl reference!

Skubana, zdolna dziołcha, nie tylko gibka ale i pomysłowa.
I actually don't like watching music videos because often they ruin the picture/vibe in my mind. Often the music videos very different from what I think it looks like in my mind and then I feel like the vibe is killed... BUT THIS ONE ACTUALLY HIT EVERYTHING RIGHT OMG!

I loved the song but i am really disappointed with the video, the aesthetics do not flow well together i think the creative direction should have taken place elsewhere, looks like a bad students film. On the other hand, beautiful, beautiful song and vocals, I love the teaser song too. I'm really excited for the whole album. Do your ting miss sza.

Pole dancing in a library is the perfect combination of intellectuality and self-expression - which you can do both with no labels of a nerd or a hooker. Be yourself. xoxo from the Azores, Portugal.

I loved, loved, loved this video! I wish they could have taken the lip sync take out of one of video completely because I just felt like it didn’t need to be included in this, but overall I enjoyed this video. Like it’s just... wow! 😭💙

The unbothered vibe from this video is needed
The same way we had "Good Days" on streaming services, "T-Shirt" deserves the same love. Been wanting it since it was on tiktok.😭
If I need a restful sleep,  I just have to tune this song on.
I love it, this song is like my daily drug.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhghhhhhhhhh🥰
Last December I had a major depression. My life is on the edge, thinking about ending it all sooo many times. But this song came to me, ever since Christmas there is no day I dont listen to this, every single day, changing my tears from pure pain and slowly ease it all.   Slowly gain back trust for myself each days. It feel so good to finally be able to breath, seeing things in more clearer way. Cant believe music can turn me in such way. And Im so thankful for that.   I hope for every single person out there who's been suffering the same things as me that everything will eventually get better. being able to breath a lil bit more, you are love. good days will always come to you.
*sad twerk*
SZA!!!
you blow my mind everytime. :))

i can't even put it into words how therapeutic and healing this song is. From the starting instrumental right down to her soothing voice... I was watching the rain fall while listening to this track yesterday and it gave me a sense of life that I can't even explain. Like I wanted to continue living, for however long I could.

brigada por isso
i cant even describe the feeling of euphoria i get just listening to this, let alone seeing it
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.
wow 😌
In the dark right now Feeling lost, but I like it Comforting my sins and all about me Only got right now Feeling days of resentment Simmer in my skin It's all of about  [Chorus] Blood stain on my shirt New bitch on my nerves Old nigga got curved Going back on my word Damn, bitch, you like thirty
Zaa ngan nissa , aku syg ko duak

Anybody’s else’s volume seems to be low even at max??? I need to hear everything!!
Yesss yessssssss Lordy yessss
I love the symbiotic dichotomy of this video.. on the one hand the mushroom world is dramatic and Extra.. note her over emphasis in her erratic dance moves.. fighting demons and negativity.. and then you have this solemn pole dancing.. unfaded.. unbothered enthralled in self care and personal growth elegantly, controlled and free sliding down that pole.. truly reflecting the Good Days that are Now.. in the moment.. in The Present... #GoodVibesOnly ... Genius Sis!!  (slow clap 👏🏽..👏🏽👏🏽..👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽).
Sza, can you honestly give us a run down of the pole dancing ‼️
My favorite song.💚🧡🍄
THE Damn b u like 30 need have it’s own video 😭💖 who’s with me   ⬇️

I'm here march 5th 10:02pm 2021 shes my comfort zone
A voooz véi 🔥🔥🔥
This is what being on shrooms feels like.
I can't stand stan culture and how an artists' so called "fans" can make an artist insecure about their creative expression. So many of you overlistened to that snippet at the end of Hit Different so that when the aural masterpiece that was the single finally released, she was heckled to the point where she had to compromise her art and revert back to that unpolished version. Now she's clearly felt compelled to use it again for the video instead of letting the magic of that single's production shine through alongside her voice. You so called fans are the absolute worst, such consumerist vultures, thinking only about yourselves and not how you can manipulate an artist
SHE ATE THAT UP GOOD DAYS X SHIRT
QUEEN❤!!!!!!!
1:31 pls tell me i wasnt the only one who thought of the globglogabgalab

QUEEN
CLEARED!
YESSSS MA’AMMMMMM
SHE IS SERVING
.. it's like she's healing herself through dance in both a sensual way on the pole,  and in a spiritually grounding way in the forest 💚 notice how the same exotic poses in her exotic scene translated into yoga  poses in the forest scene 🤔 .. also, notice how in her early exotic scenes she was surrounded by books instead of an actual club environment as if to communicate her club experiences as lessons 💜
❤️
Killed thiss😌❤! And those shoessss😍😍!
𝗖𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗿𝘆 ™🧚🏾‍♀️

I thought this music video was going to be about her childhood and how those days were good days. maybe if she could have shown some NOSTALGIC things she did as a child and the games she played she. could have put like a kid actor that looks like her and then meet her younger self and tell her to enjoy her childhood while it lasts, that would be beautiful. but what she did HERE I'm a little disappointed it was literally just her dancing on a pole...
SHIRT THOOOOO HOLLLL UP

We need the second song on SPOTIFY!!
😭😭
i love sza... pero it's interesting to see so many artists recently, especially 2019-current, cosplay as skrippers, cam girls, and s3x workers all the time bc the aesthetics of it are bomb and we're the shit. but in no other context is it regarded as cool, or even at all. s3x workers as a whole are completely disregarded, slut shamed, and treated as inferior in society as a whole. but popstars put on pleasers fr the day and it's artistry.
This lady carry mhee through depression I owe you a lot🥺🤍
OMGGGGGG I LOVE YOUUUUU

I LUV U

Just because it's SZA❤️🔥🔥❤️
I wonder if she was actually trying to read the book lmao
now we wait for the snippet of that song to be released
I’m pretty sure all the librarians feel sexy now...but all jokes asides, she’s elaborating how looks can NOT define one’s intellectual standing.

Wow. This is truly a piece of art. 💛

Amoooo 😍😍🥰🥰

I love sza she is so creative when it comes to her music she takes time and expressed her self
She's finishing this video by introducing a new song, which is the same thing she did to introduce "Good Days" in her video for "Hit Different." I really hope this means an album is coming and that it's being dropped video by video!!

Maravilhosa
The video reminds me so much of ice moon!!
Cottage core realness
A perfeição
THE POLE DANCING.. WOW 😩
Love the free sample
everything about this is just so perfect.
She so Pretty 😩
Yessss it all starts at the root. The core. The essence. Thankyou for being an expression of God. Love you Sza much and always
my girlfriend put me on.. can’t stop playing. shits too good.
Muito linda
I swear that’s one of my candles in the beginning ... 👀
ascends
this is not a good music video imo. love the song cause it had so much potential.
HOW GOOD TO BE A FAN
SZA I hope you continue to forever bless us with your gift ♥️
Fka twigs was featured 😭🥵❤️
Perfeita demais!! 🥵❤️❤️
As per usual, SZA's visuals are crazy.  She starts out being a mushroom. Mushrooms can form miles and miles of "roots", making them one of the most firmly planted beings on the planet, immobile and inextricably bound, like SZA feels about the idea that she's wasted her "Good Days" in an unfruitful relationship. As she starts to realize that her youth (best part of her, as she feels) wasn't wasted in the relationship, she progressively breaks free and starts dancing wildly, the ultimate expression of liberation; she's putting the fun in fungi lol.   Ionne get the library scene with the pole dancing tho.
4:31 How you gon' do us like that?! 😩
I needed this
lets be honest she just wanted to show her pole skills
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you! :)
The way I sat up when 4:31 hit
this is such a beautiful music video, the visuals are literally so pretty. nothing less expected from queen sza!! she don't miss

Yeeeeesssss SZA pure vibes! Give them those visuals!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y’all can’t imagine how I screamed when I heard the last song.... SZA knows how to announce her next hit (already a hit tho)... 😩😩😍😍
Sometimes I think she’s putting a spell on me.I be feeling so relaxed.🥴💕
I love the artistic part of pole work.

bitch i am mesmerised
EVERYBODY STREAM THIS MUSIC VIDEO IM NOT PLAYING!
Wish it was easier to explain what this just did to me! 🍄🤯🎶🛸💜🌈🔮🔥💕
I'm just confused on the theme of this video...
The ending.... i'm GAGGED
Love you boo
Sza pls stop stepping on our necks 😭✋🏾
The way she teased shirt at the end felt like when you’ve been seeing a really hot guy for a while now and you go to finally get laid and then he’s like let’s just cuddle that disappointment hurt 😢
watching this makes me feel like ive just been blessed
YESSSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
i love how she listens to us
SZA really goin off on this one. This video is the best weird flex of all time LOL
bruh I screamed and my family was looking at me crazy
Anyone else crying from how perfect she is? Just me? Ok
Y’all don’t know what good days truly means to me lord... this song saved me from a nasty ass breakup and losing hella friends. It has magical healing powers and that’s on everything. Also that shirt teaser was just immaculate. We love u Solana.
Ik she did not just tease us with just another word to shirt 😔😔🤧🤧
WHEN I TELL YOU I FLEW THROUGH THE WALL. SZA IS AMAZING
I DONT MISS NO EX I DONT MISS NO TEXT I CHOOSE NOT TO RESPOND
Everytime I listen to this song I feel like my ears are cleaned and my soul is healed
I think the people that disliked this were just too dizzy from the pole dance that they hit the wrong button
Your line about our youth being in the present has given me so much perspective. Especially as a woman given we’re not allowed to age by society and media’s standards. Those lyrics have grounded me in my present body l, and to stop obsessing about age when my youth is here and now xxx love u 💞💞💞
love you solana!
Love all of this!!!
2:30 the computer on the ctrl album cover making an appearance...

SIZZZA
Yea, 30 girl. Things finally start to make sense in life about 6 months after that. And then on through 34, all the confusing things that happened to you because of other people and yourself take on a whole new meaning. A deeper one. Where you understand human tendency better, so you have the context to become more patient with yourself, with others, and with the complexities of how life and manifestation works.
DAMN
here before 1M yall
SZA

I cannot wait for this fucking album 🥴
I think this is probably my favorite song of hers. I love the meaning behind it. I feel it 100%
Exactly what I needed after today 😌
A literal masterpiece ✨
This song is my life
Before the first milli❗️
I feel sorry for these teenage girls growing up in this era. Everything doesn't have to be sexualized and she doesn't have to be portrayed being on a pole. What happened to the innocent, clean female artists to look up to like the Brandys, Monicas, Toni Braxtons, Whitney Houstons, TLCs? Why does everything have to be sexualized. If I wanted to see b!tches dancing on the pole, I would have watched these female rap artists but female rnb artists too? Damn
Y this remake? what's the point?
OMG SHE SOO BEAUTIFUL I DONT KNOW OMG :(
what’s up with the algorithm this should’ve had like a mil views considering it already has 50k likes💀
💚
YES 😍😍
this feels illegal to be early on a sza post,,this fire
BUT “SHIRT” AT THE END THO
The choreography, 💓her💓, her talent , the transitions 🤍, the garden ugh I luv thiss the intro & outro✨
Waoooow 😍😍😍
OMG
I’m so in love with SZA 😍😍😍😍😍
She’s literally the most beautiful human being and my eyes can’t comprehend 😭😭😭
ILY BAE
Special

Am I the only one who's addicted to this song or?
i literally love you.
OMGGG QUEENNNN
Out there doing drugs to promote what I thought was a good song. Imagining your aligning with your higher self in the library of connectivity. I understand the journal of manifestation but SZA the kids who watch this don’t realize your talking about being high to reach a higher consciousness  not to be inquire a drug addiction. You have kids out here interested in your imagery as it is earthy but at the same time as a witch you have to be careful as well about visualization as what you put out to the universe will return back to you. The energy in this video is dark. I am too in spiritual awakening so I seen what the average eye 👁 didn’t comprehend. Be very careful what you watch viewers you will start to envy what she is doing and okaying it for yourself.
This is so beautiful I can’t wait for the album
This is the only time ive ever been early omg
Diva
STREAM ANACONDA💕💕💕
Epic

lyrics :) Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days) Good days, always (good days) Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear, if you let me Feeling like (on your own) Feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby Heavy on my empty mind shit I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (my mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind) good days (good days on my mind) Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

SHE ADDED EXTRA AT THE END OMG ITS SO ANGELIC ILY
I’m fucking SHOOK.  Growth, pulling yourself from the ground/past and returning to your roots. Education while embracing your sexuality and body. Clearing negative energy with singing bowls then gassing yourself up.
Here before one million
I love the song but the video really does not fit the music or the lyrics
omfg i love ittt
fridays are now my favorite day of the week
SZA really said “y’all better have a good mf day 😡😡” and after this, it’s a phenomenal day
she's a fucking GODDESS
BEEN WAITING ON THIS!!!
Fu- wow this is amazing the dancing the beauty just wow
mother

No one Is going to talk about the dance moves?
I just got into Sza since I’ve admittedly been very desperate for new music this year but I adored Ctrl and I can’t wait for her to release her next album.
this music video is great. SZA looking beautiful as always. new snippet sounds great. I'm so excited for this new album

gon say before a mil jus cuz i can
why does the green guy in the computer look like taehyung or is it just me
god is a women
banger
Ahhhh, I ammmm screamingggguh🥰😭❤️
Me : SZA is the black version of Tinkerbell  Tinkerbell at 3:14 : 👁️👄👁️🍃
Black women with orange hair are everything I need. Cause y´all see how stunning my girl SZA looks with color.😍
i can smell the snippets of shirt all over my fyp on tiktok
HERE AT 100K VIEWSSSSSS.
may both sides of SZA’s pillow be cold 🙏
This Song is such a vibe but the video seems kinda pointless and the video camera effect was disturbing to be honest
WAITTTTT YAYYYYY
My take on the music video:  Someone partaking in learning about themselves and spirituality. The pole dancing scenes: a woman feeling her divine femininity. That including sexuality, confidence, & intelligence
I'm so proud of her journey getting to this point. It's beautiful Solana 💖
Pole dancing in a library is Thee Vibe
if art was person
1 HOUR LATEEEE
Omggggg
SHE KNOW SHE FINE MHMM WORK IT😫😫
OHMYGODDDDDDDDD
Absolutely loveeeeee
i’m so glad i did my black history month project on her 😁

I really needed this, I love you miss SZA
loveeee!! this is such a vibe
THIS. IS. INCREDIBLE
The pole dancing in the library is a visual metaphor for how when sza was younger she tried to find a balance of her work and social life. She studying marine biology very passionately, represented by the library and her reading whilst she pole dances, which is where we she worked during college.
She is so beautiful wow
Claim your “here before 1 million” ticket 🥰

This woman is a woodland fairy ( ˘ ³˘)♥︎
I live for her.

You can tell back in the day with her old music she didn’t really embrace her femininity. Now she does and she does it beautifully. Makes me want to be 100 percent comfortable in my body and with my sexual, sensual side.

❤🧨🔥🔥💣💣💣💣🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
Mesmerizing as always
i love how she evolved from 4 years ago to now
This song is literally my morning song. It gets me to get up and breathe and go on. When it was the ending part of hit different I was so in love. I’m glad it’s getting all the recognition.
HERE BEFORE A MIL
🍄🤍 a psychedelic experience
HERE BEFORE 1M (currently at 120k)
we all needed this.
MANO O FINAL---------------
YES YES YES SHIRT IS THE NEXT SONG OMG IM FREAKING OUT THE LYRICS ARE GOOD🤩
I love sza but am I the only person who thought the MV was a lot
Just got cornrows done and my scalp is in agony, SZA made me better🥰🧚🏾‍♂️🍄✨
I dont listen to SZA but this is a bop💕
Sza is to be protected at all cost
omg the directors name is Solana, my name is Solana LOL
Not this woman teasing us again 😭
OMG IM EARLY
she is incredible
I would honestly do anything just to hear this song for the first time again, its so...angelic
Now Ms Solana yk that you just can’t tease us at the end like that and not release the whole song 😭🥴
SZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
She is so pretty.
how imma live my life from now on: "Directed by Solana"
Whos here before it goes viral
SZA is literally the reason why I’m always happy 😭
i love de lycris , i admire SZA a lot but i didn't like the video
this rollout for songs is honestly everything as well. Are we getting a visual album to accompany all of these song previews ?? I think you should hit us with the Solange when I get home vibes sis. We love you & need it all!!
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven.    God bless you.
She’s so beautiful
That drum part on shirt is so fireeeee
queen
love it
omg it’s the queen
I’m so in loveeeeee
NOT THE BLOODSTAINS (SHIRT) PREVIEW AT THE END
i genuinely love this woman
she's a legend, she's an icon, and she IS the moment, NOW COME ON NOW
Shes M.I.A no tweets no Instagram  no nothing  just drop a bombshell on us
here before 1 milli
Gosh she's a QUEEN 😩❤
I loveee youuuu!! ❤️
I don’t get why pole dancing is an aesthetic but stripping is so called trashy
im sh00k
I try to keep from losing the rest of me" I felt that😔😪
SZA is on 🔥
I'm here for this song. but bruh... the video is underwhelming. aight you nice and all but it just didn't resonate with I personally felt. However, nice visuals for the pole in the library.  The second song sounds good though very similar to Summer.
Damn SZA a different breed. She showin us she back on her shit (not that she ain’t been off), but that she ain’t nothing to be messed with. This content though 🥺🥺🥺 Just makes us want more from you Solanaaaa 🎶🙏🏼
We love you Solana
Everyone is here discussing her concept and i'm over here tryna wrap my leg around my bed post like hers on that pole. ⚘🌹🌻
I’m in love with this video
YASSS GURL SLAY💕💕💕💕💕💕
Sza literally has a place in every aesthetic
FINALLY

Who else hit the dance from tiktok at 5:17 😂
Why am I crying i-
sounding more like classic sza now i love it
my day has been made.
THE WAY I WASNT EXPECTING SHIRT TO BE AT THE END ;-;
i think shirt comes out in 2 or 3 months because the hit different video had good days and released 3 months after, aside from that she ate this 🥵✨🦋🔥

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let your edge out Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind Can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit … I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent" Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me … All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in good days, good days Always, always, always inside Good day living in my mind … Tell me about my fears, my limitations I'll disappear, if you let me Feeling like, yeah (Woah), feeling like Jericho Feeling like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood Know you like, that shit getting good with it Baby, baby, heavy on my empty mind shit … I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby You don't care Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent" (Urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (My mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me Choose to watch While the world break up and fall on me … All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in good days, good days Always, always, always sunny inside Good day living in my mind … Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I just choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste and our youth is in the present Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present … Always on my mind, always on my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always on my mind, always on my mind, mind
Just a vibe I resonate with so hard...
