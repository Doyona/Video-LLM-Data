What job should Mandy seek out next?
Babylon Bee used to be satire.
Brilliant. Spot on.
"Are you thinking what I'm thinking? ""I don't know. All I know is that's she's cute, but I wouldn't do her with you.".
I'm sorry but the name of that game needs to be changed. Two guys having a corn hole sesh on the roof sounds ,, well.... you decide.
Love how it turned into Office Space!
The girl looks like pornstar Lena paul.😂
Hahaha lol
Wait so working at twitter wasn't a real job
“Miss” how dare you miss gender me
Funny how the BB can’t keep up with reality.
"what is it you say ya did there?" intentionally reminiscent of Office Space?
45 seconds in, "I'm sorry, you don't fit what we need.  Thank you for trying.  Good bye."  Then I would make copies of the video I make for every interview.
mm hard fopr you
Facebook mods spring to mind as well. 😂
This aged so well people censor "j*b" now
She would have definitely accused yall of black face from that oil on your hands.
😂😂😂 lol. I clicked thinking this is a serious documentary. Rofl…
One of my co-worker with huge tech background complained that calling her on the phone twice a day is giving her unnecessary and unbearable mental charge.
So true. Maybe just abort the whole next generation. Save time now.
She reminds me of Lena Paul😂
Its impossible for me to believe that someone looking for a job can be so stupid.
Bas et from France, many thanks for all professors in gender studies you sent us.😂
Then she runs out of money, can't pay for food and comes crying at the bank for a loan. The bank : "Oh you don't have an actual job ? Sorry, that's kind of a deal-breaker for me."
X is great Twitter was awful😅😅
Legend has it that on this day you can still hear the screams of FASCIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
File WPB
Seems like there is heavy censorship on this site as well.
80% of the employees laid off and X is functioning better than ever. Go Elon
Nobody wants a Twitter b****
OMG, another great video by you guys !
Where did you get this video from? This is straight up a sting operation. I was hoping for a skit.
0:49  Modern Women
She is hilarious.
This really isn't a joke.This is what the workforce consists of now.
If, during the COVID lockdowns, you were NOT deemed "essential," you are almost certainly living off the labor of others. In fact If I could I would ensure that everyone who was essential made more than the lowest paid person who was not.
1:05, Bob and Bob!
Leftists don’t believe in 12 step because they have to recognize a higher power outside themselves.   I’m serious they hate it and won’t do it.
bro we have the j*b meme before the j*b meme
This is oddly accurate
sounds like the typical federal/state employee
This is why they all still live at home.
Tech employees aren’t actually like this…….
It sounds funny, but even in 2025, I have many friends who work at Google, who has same entitlement mindset
Time for a sequel - Former Twitter Employee Whines That Affordable Housing and Government Aid Are Needed Due to Continuous Unemployment. It would be documentary but still entertaining.
America's and Americans downfall started the day they decided that manual labour was beneath them.
Sad but true LOL.
That Joke aged like Milk 😅
And yet the valuation dropped 70% after Musk took over. I get that a company that can be used to influence public opinion has value well above its capability to generate profit, but that didn't stop being true once Musk took over.
can anyone tell what cornhole means im not a native english speaker
Her Cornhole sess? Lol
1:04 aged like wine according to last week. Lol
lol. Mandy’s hot.
How is Twitter employee not a real job
Fellow federal employees, we meet here again 2 years later! :)
Pretty sure it was this girl that banned me off several forums for saying common sense. lol. Seriously, though,  these people do exist and it wasn't just at Twitter. Youtube still does it today, though I notice they seem a bit more afraid of doing it too much at the moment.
Babylon Bee...punching every button with precision...just outdamnstanding.
"cornhole sesh" 😂
I wonder if Mandy thought about using something like Resubot to help with her resume. It might have made things a bit easier for her.
Mandy's experience really highlights how unpredictable the job hunt can be. I feel for her.
Ohhh Suzi wants a mimosa right now
she should have said the Grease was racist and he was doing black face lmao
She reported him for staring at her and making her uncomfortable 😂 thats an actual thing they do !! Talk about self flattery and attention seeking !!
Gen-Z chicks will NOT do any job where they could possibly break a fingernail. (Not even at gunpoint. You would have to pull the trigger.)  She might be qualified to work a private toll booth at an airport parking lot. But only if the cash register tells her how much change to give. Like math is hard or something!
What wouldja say. Ya did there!  LOVE IT!  Allusion to Office Space!  Y'all rule!
Is she the same actress from that  job application with the older guy several years ago?
I wish this was only fiction. No wonder my company doesn't want me to retire. If we find someone who can do some work, they never stick around long.
Elon saved America by taking over Twitter.  Change my mind.
All Gen zeros
the encouraging thing is that they believe in abortion........... fewer in the future
True.
I don't think this is even satire... this is a documentary...
Coincidentally we have a few people like this at "work" even now, still in December 2024
3:06 Ms!?!? Did you just assume their gender!?!? What a terrible place to wor… to labor at!
😂😂😂 so true., they dont what is work
As a former restaurant manager, I have interviewed my share of young people just like this.
He visto este sketch al menos 10 veces y lo veré otras 10 antes que acabe el 2024, el 2025 y así
Yeah cool.The very clever "What would you say ya did there" (Office Space vibes) sent me. lines don't always land ,but this one did big time for me.
Aha-ha-ha-ha! Pretty funny! I’ve seen these people too!
It used to be like this when we interviewed former civil service workers. Never hired a single one and we just started throwing away applications with any type of government job history with the exception being military veterans. Those were usually our best employees.
Are those pallets standing up against a wall?
So true.  Whya anyone would hire a woman I don't know.  Never have, never will.
She needs to return to reality. She is the most worthless employee that can exist.
I had an new employee like this at work a few years ago.  I wrote a letter to management - she was gone the next day.
google is digging up 1980s ideas
😅
Spot on! Love the nod to Office Space.
I too worked in a top US company in Bangalore. Work culture was so unprofessional and nobody was holding any responsibility. No proper timings. People misused all facilties given. No punctuality, meetings are like picnics by hormonal teenager's . 5 minutes job takes 1 week and endless remainders. People dont answer back within reasonable time to emails or communicator messages. No work every really gets done. After few years human relations where such sour people stopped talking to each other. Office env became so corrosive. Management had no skills in leadership or delegating jobs. It was politics and politics and no work. One of our US office had 150 employees. When a top level management person visited that office he did not find people in the security station also. Later he was told that everybody was doing work from home, even the security person 😂. It was like a free booze party people trying to extract max as long as it worked. People used to get angry at us if we tell them that they are wasting our time also(in effect companys time ). People used to sit all day watching sports online or sit in cafeteria all day chatting, browsing net, but will make you follow for 1 month for 5 mins job. It was not just india office emp who very misusing the faciltiles and free flowing work culture but US emps too. People were simply wasting company time and claiming to be busy. It was anything barely professional or civilized.
"So, ... whaddaya say ... ya do?" WHO ELSE GOT OFFICE SPACE FLASHBACKS!?!???!
I love the "real job" part of the title.
😂😂😂 no wonder Ellon fired them
It's been 2 year 😂 and Twitter running fine
I can't tell-is this satire or a documentary?
that feels insane yet why do i feel like their are people out their like that?
If this weren't factual it would be funny.
I am a policeman. I have already seen people freak out because they have to carry weapons and drive a police car. They considered this "oppression". But upholding the law is a way to fight oppression, I think.
It is way too exaggerated but this part was hilarious 0:48
Lol spot on. I can see those lazy ex twitter employees straight woke and dumb.
Twitter employee needs a transplant now, oh but the  anesthesiologist formerly worked at Twitter and is late so let's start without it shall we.
Looking forward to the re-boot of this episode. This time portraying some lazy, clueless, semi-retrrded, spoiled, fired, former federal govt worker.
Man, this aged like milk :D
thank you Elon, thank you for cleaning the swamp
Unfortunately, she then came to Australia and was appointed E-safety commissioner. If we pay postage, can we send her back? Please?
One woman had to go home twice during the same week.  Why you ask?  Because she ate too much at lunch and needed to go lie down.  True story
I’m only 35 seconds in…. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!! So fucking good!!!!!
Everything for women and with women is a problem...
Emotional Damage!
Work set u free,  no it slaves
What an utterly ridiculous parody of the poor people mean EM fired from their jobs.... The interview would be way, way worse than this.  Likely she would sue after for encroaching on her safe mindspace.
Fi
I'm a properties maintenance engineer(multi skilled), I'm in drains, on top of roofs, repairing windows,doors, plumbing, sorting out shorts, concreting, regularly p*ss wet through, fault finding, rebuilding mechanical sections, the roofing's pretty dicey, especially when it's very windy or hailing. I'm 65 yo. These arses contribute nothing to society, wait for the reset, it'll be funny as hell
Musk did a good job to fire all those useless people.
Half of the potential new hires at my place of employment are like this and possibly worse. Needless to say it takes a lot longer to fill the positions when weeding the entitled, loonies out. What's worse is when they put someone like this in a position of authority. Nothing ever gets done, unless someone from a completely different location steps in and does it themselves.
проблема не в таких нежных девочках, что не не знают что такое работа, а в таких странных мальчиках которые пытаются подстраиваться под их капризы.
“But this is a job.”  “We…don’t say that either 😊.”
shes pretty cute, i wonder who she is.
Missed a trick with ‘manual labour’. Isn’t that misogyny or something??
This is whats going on at bluesky
I am not worried for them. They are most probably hired here on YouTube shadow banning me, or on Facebook... whatever. Same shit, different censorship package.
Who caught the office space sample. What would you say..... Ya did there.😂😂😂
About 45 years ago I was posted to sort out a failing branch.  I walked into the office to find staff smoking, loafing about, wearing jeans, T shirts and trainers.  The place was a mess and the manager was not in control.  I asked them to stop smoking, start working and return after lunch (they went home for lunch) in office clothing of trousers, shirts and ties (for men) and skirts/blouses etc (for women).  Remember 45 years ago.  They came back exactly the same and I sacked them on the spot.   Unions were involved but they'd all broken their contracts and the firm stood by me. The manager and his wife couldn't hack it & left too. They would have all gone anyway as they weren't making a loss and the branch would have closed.  I felt bad, but I single handed turned round that office by sheer hard work and got it up running to employ new management and staff who were glad of a job and proud of what they did.  I moved onto the next one before my 21st birthday.  Some years later I had my own company and an interviewee came in 20 minutes late carrying her food shopping and dressed all in black (Goth).  She asked me to shut any windows and doors as she was scared of bee stings.  Unfortunately she didn't get the job.   Never fails to amaze me.
Oh my sides, some random nobody that has to sleep at night with the TV on if they see blood from a papercut has opinions on how easy content moderation is.   At least we know why people don't host contests for being pathetic, you've got no match!
Thanks for all the Office Space references))
Hilarious!  And so funny to hear everyone talk about cornholing.  That had a totally different meaning not that long ago, if you liked to @ss those type of games in the h#le...
This joke aged poorly considering that when Musk fired the first wave of "unnecessary" employees, Twitter crashed. Effing brilliant.
Actually in Australia one Ex-twitter employee is now the government information czar and is attempting to censor twitter
Cornhol'in in Canada must mean something else.
love it
Yeah all this made me smile. Well done
That is soooo accurate 🤣🤣🤣
If i see your resume has twitter, i automatically would toss it to the trash
I’m surprised she didn’t ask for a severance package after the interview 😆
Yo, I heard the DNC hired all of the “displaced” employees from Twitter’s restructuring….they were integral components in the Harris campaign. After all, they did such a good job at Twitter…..
Stuff! 😄
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS!  The most depressing part of them is that you NAIL the beliefs and personalities of these Leftist useful idiots. EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING - you’re not even embellishing their insanity because you don’t have to. THIS IS THEM. And when they are around like-minded people this is EXACTLY HOW THEY TALK. America has voted-down this 30-year, Obama-led, Marxist power-grab by Washington DC. For the first time in our history, for this election, there were NO PARTY DIVISIONS at all. The GOP/RNC was in step with the DNC, 100%. Unprecedented. Hopefully Trump’s last 4 years will be followed by 8 years of Vance (similar to the 12 Reagan/Bush Sr. years of common sense reset from the horrible 60’s and 70’s). But these people will never go away. Rush used to say that an enemy needed to be completely destroyed, and not just defeated. Very hard to do in a free society, and that will always be a good thing. Lord knows, their immediate future plan was to begin jailing the Right for “hate speech” crimes. And that would have been the catalyst for an unfortunate fight to save our Republic. Thank God we are saved from that, at least for now. Always be vigilant. Another Obama is probably pooping in his/her diaper right now.
so  real  it  hurts
can you make a crossover episode with The Onion ?
I made a trip to Cincinnati, Ohio years back.  I was astounded when my sponsor for the trip asked me if I wanted to participate in a Cornhole Session.  WHAT!  He repeated, a Cornhole Session.  Well I don't know about you but when I was growing up Cornhole had a totally different meaning...I'm sure ALL of you older folks know what I'm talking about.  I don't think drinking a Mimosa would have helped!  Needless to say, I totally Declined, and left the next day.
This is how half of my staff act at work. What a joke this world is.
2 years later, still relevant
This is not parody… It’s facts
I wanna smell this girl’s cornhole
hahahaha so spot on :P
This shit gets me mad.
They get indoctrinated early and you have to fight hard and often to keep your kids head on straight.  Went to my daughter’s college orientation.  They literally spent half the day touring the counseling and spa facilities and the meditation/emotional crisis rooms. Meanwhile they showed one powerpoint slide on their graduation rates and one slide on their student success rates.  In our tour group All the moms were especially giddy about the light wavelengths used in the crisis rooms.  It didnt soothe me and the other two dads very much.
The sad truth is it’s true ! I once had an employee that used the Job Job analogy.
It Would Be FUN if it wasn" t   TRUE   !!!
Weird part is that this is not humor or fiction.. This is actual reality for millions of "workers" that post all over social media about their dream lives..
When World War III starts and lands on US shores, all of these people will be rushing to OnCall to get their prescription for Xanax renewed.  Amazon will instantly run out of stress balls and there will be a massive run on weed at the dispensaries.
Did Morgan quit the Bee? I don’t see her in videos anymore.
Dude, if the guy giving me the interview has HIS hands dirty, I'd take that as a green flag.  That's likely a supervisor who's not afraid to get in the trenches with his subordinates.
I think this was like that one time where Kamela Harris decided that she didn't really want to be president anyway
When I was a chef years ago we employed a guy from a London IT firm who had been made redundant. He had come for the Kitchen Porter job and when we showed him the cleaning cupboard housing all the cleaning stuff I thought he was going to faint. He worked 4 hours went to lunch and never came back.
Ahh...."what would you say you did there?" Great Office Space call out.
I refuse to believe this is 100%   true
BYOG 😀
I love the homage to office space.
Wait is Elon going to carry a Sink into the White House next? HAHAHA
She’s hot.
"Work, labor, stuff getting done, i mean not done"  Bro lol these videos always slap
Good way to avoid job discrimination lawsuits. 😂😂😂
Woo hoo
Cornhole is about the only thing she was qualified for.
Thats most of young people today👏👏👏👏👏👏👏congrats parents.  You have prepared your children well.
Mandy looks LOT like Stacey Dooley . Gotta check the credits
Learn a trade.
Gay activist in Lebanon.
Actually 80% of the staff was laid off. Musk realised that  80% of the employees actually accomplished Zero
Honeymoon is over princess
Elon Musk should win the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Congressional Medal of Freedom for what he did with Twitter
I would have ended the interview after her first sentence and suggested therapy. Having twelve years of experience in mental health I can say so.
I work in the oil industry in the Scottish North Sea , we had one woke type guy quit on his second day as he refused to work in the “ unpleasant wind  driven rain “
Bob Denver was best known as Gilligan on the 1960’s television show Gilligan’s Island.  Before that he played a character known as Maynard T Krebbs on a television show call The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.  Dwayne Hickman played Dobie.  Maynard was Dobie’s best friend and Maynard was a beatnik in the classic 1950’s style.  Every time someone would use the word “work”, Maynard would repeat it out in a very doglike yip sound.  Somewhere on YouTube there has to be a video of one of these episodes.
Absolute disgusting and entitled.
Come on, put a little bit more effort in than this badly written skit you’re on the right track but try a bit harder
Made me laugh, thanks
And that was 80% of the employees at Twitter.
The people need more of this
Her job options very limited. She useless younger generation to the workforce.Her only option sadly is nothing.
Thank you Elon for firing those losers !
The 2 Girls who are part of this "troupe" are both really cute!! Snd they're funny as hell!!
Perfect!  And the Dems wonder why they’re history!
So she became an acoholic on "Mimosa's" ? ...that doesn't even mke sense...  PS. I'm not subscribing to this. I'm Polish. We drink vodka and beer. We are PROPER alcoholics! We work HARD for EVERYTHING!
Don't dis gas station attendants  starbucks baristes ok
I was living in a shared house and came through the back door having been doing so work in the yard. As I washed my hands at the kitchen sink the girl sharing the house with us said,  “I’d never marry a man who washes his hand in the kitchen sink” To which I replied  ‘No… you’d never a man who actually gets his hands dirty”
While I know this is entirely satire, I can't help but think there had to be at least a handful of these working there.
Is that what the work environment for facebook is like?
That was great and it's the very image most people have of former Twitter employees because some of them have meticulously crafter it.
So you guys wasted money on buying Alex Jones Website 😂😂😂😂 enjoy burning your money. 🤣 🤡 🤡
As someone who identifies as non-binary tree fungus I fully understand the reasonable expectations of they/them to live a parasitic lifestyle supported by lesser-evolved beings who are actually engaged in productive labor.
If someone had "Twitter" on their CV , they dont get an interview. Being laid off by Twitter is all I would need to know
Notice how, even in this parody, the employer kowtows to the employees wishes.  This is going to stop now.  Stand your ground with these progressives.
Yep! That about sums it up right there! I had to quit my last job because the boss let the slack ass snow flakes run the place! They called in sick every Monday Wednesday and Friday! I hated that job! Now I'm retired and loving it!
I retired early because I couldn't take this kind of BS infiltrating the workforce any more. My long term bosses were pissed and asked me why ? I told them because you idiots won't stand up to this nonsense. My choice is not to work for you anymore. They still called me repeatedly for "advice" at which point I just reminded them " I do not work for you anymore ". Last I heard many long term male employees also left and they were spending huge sums on consultants
Cornhole? Does that mean what I think it means?
"what would you say you do there"?    A tribute to Office Spaces.
I worked….ummm…I mean did stuff at, a company that had a full bar on the top floor. Plus, each department had its own booze cabinet. More than once I saw people staggering by 10:00am. Then there was the time I got shot in the eye with a Nerf gun.  One day I told one of my employees to do something. She looked at me and said, “Geez.  Bossy much”.  I asked her to look herself up on the company org. chart and tell me who it showed as her boss. She didn’t get my point.
Theyve all been sacked.
Clearly fake.  She didn't ask anyone what their pronouns are and didn't have a septum ring or visible tattoos
Anna Kendrick worked at Twitter?
This is the same already in the Australian federal public service. Been like that for 30 years. Pampered and precious and paid too much.
My wife sees this regularly. It's odd how 20 year olds and ex Airbus employees think they are so entitled.
This video is both hilarious and extremely scary at the same time as to how accurate it is about these losers.
i remember being young and my bay bomber parrents being like you generation is lazy loliam gen X
i will say IDK how woke people funtion in the real world. but i would like to point out since the beging of time each generation says the next one is lazy lol. i think they want to work but emtionally they are very soft
Imagine the low IQ to believe there is any difference in Twitter other than who owns it
You mean i actually have to work ?
Now that Elon is advising Trump, it won’t be long before 80% of the useless clowns working in the Government get the Twitter treatment! 😂😂😂😂
20 minutes late for interview... I AM NOT WASTING MY TIME WITH YOU!!!!!
I was responsible for an Intern like this gal. She spent all day doing online shopping. When we came to review her, I asked, “what have your top three achievements been in the last month.” She said that she had set up her company email address. I told her that the IT Dept had done this, the day before she started. She burst into tears and went home. We didn’t hire her.
Self-censorship is the first step to accepting or giving credibility to these idiots, Now is the time to Re-set and bring back common sense to the world…
She sounds like kamala
Hopefully Elon can send all the Fed workers who don’t do anything packing real soon also.
She’s a looser
I came to work and found two dementia residents attempting to exit the building and stopped them as they got past the last door outside. I brought them back inside and secured the front door and helped them back to their rooms. I finally found my two coworkers and asked them politely to maybe monitor the front door better, one of the Gen Z people stood up and started screaming at me saying i could not tell them what to do and the company fired me . She then quit because they were only going to write her up LMAO! God helped me find a better job.
Hunger tends to cure this ailment.
Babylon Bee banned… wham! 😂
Twitter used to be as bad as YouTube when it came to censorship. Then Jack Dorsey was fired, and returned to his home in the dumpster behind 7-11.
This would be a funny video if it wasn't all true.
Lol
Is this why a lot of American jobs are now overseas?
You are ALL a treat to my life, Thank you BabylonBee!! 🐝
So much of that is reality, makes it funny as hell.
You Guys must be full of water because you're real pissers..!!
The sad part is that this is not a parody.
based on BS
Mr. Dunsensunsenson.😂😂😂
She will do fine at OnlyFans.
The biggest Curse on our society and on these kids is "work life balance".  Somehow, someone comes up with arbitrary ratios of 50/50, 60/40, and demand relief if it doesn't match their (or the current social media 'norm') 'expectations'.  It used to be you worked so you could feed and house you and your family.  Nowadays, because no one is allowed to go hungry (fed with other people's earnings, of course), there is zero drive to produce/work.
You are comedians.  It is a good laugh.
Google employees next!🤷🏻🫶🏻🙌🏻👍🏻👋🏻😌
0:47 her reaction hearing the word "work" is absolutely comical.
Hilarious!
As ex navy, I resent the statement drink like a sailor. We take our alcoholism seriously.  Only the best Kerosene, rum and everclear. We gave repect for ourselves
...yeah... naga... naga...nagaonnawork here anymore!
Back to your parents' basement, sweetheart.  Learn to code
"Dunsonson". Son of Dunson, son of Dun. Pity Dunsonson's son.
With these woke ass Gen Zs and Alphas, you can’t talk about “work” or even labor.  You have to ask them how they contribute to the means of production
2:26 how ironic for this video she is asking if they have “a Guru” and “a meditation room”. But twitter used to be extremely biased against India and Indian culture. Twitter loved to ban more good Indian accounts than anything else.
18th like
Anything on the genocidal slaughter of children in Gaza, 14,000 according to UN, devout chrsitains like you would have an opinion surely rather than this merde.
loved it.....................
Classic!
😂😂😂😂😂 All the way I didn't hear half of it! 😂😂😂😂
A friend of mine works in HR for a large corporation with a local office.  They would get phone calls from parents demanding to know why their 22 year old child was fired.
Mandy would be perfect as the speaker for the house pushing other people's narrative's
I give it a 7, she didn't have blue hair and a nose piercing
Crap acting
They can’t work a real job.
Lmao
1:31 I have an uncle Steve who lives in Fruitport…
"The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor." Proverbs 12:24
I told my HR rep that I have anxiety attacks...from that day nobody even comes close to challenging me on anything...I basically do what I want at my own pace....gotta love the system we now have in the workplace.
I left twitter after Elon musk made it into a hate fest.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:13 Hahah, what the hell?
Libs don't have a worry in the world. Just apply for a government job (white collar of course), or a job with a media outlet, or an academia job. The people in power look after those with the 'correct' ideology/worldview.
i really can't tell if you honestly have no idea what cornhole means, or if you are doing that on purpose....
Elon is not evil you are for censoring people like you tube does Facebook and tik tok
cam girl?
I was like this without being woke. I remember an agency telling me once I was going to have to 'hit the ground running' 😂 in the call centre I worked at they would tell us to 'jump on the phone' if it got busy. That would always make me bristle internally. I have a bit of sympathy for her Twitter sounds like it was a not bad place to work. 😄
Apparently this wasn't entirely overacted, and there are applicants like that.  Still, there's a definite political agenda here that strongly appeals to the right-wing.  Yich.
Walmart is always hiring. No this is not a joke I am serious! Never an excuse for not finding a job! Not a high paying job but a low wage job is better than no job. Even if you have to have two or three. Never complain!!!!
She's pretty.
Where's the normie applying at Twitter job asking where the roof top corn hole is?
Makes you wonder who was stupid enough to hire ANY ex-Twitter employee?
If there is even a shred of truth to this...😮 I want a job where I fire people like this for a living.
And that sharp pain in your rectum from trans girlfriend is not a penis
*Crazy coming back here after Twitter has become the most popular social media platform in the world. The Liberal meltdown over that FACT is glorious*
)
She is applying for the wrong job....she should be an aircraft mechanic or a brain surgeon
fake interview. it never happened. gen z doesnt like to be called workers, they like to be called performers. on only fans. selling their "services".
But seriously.  Wipe your hand off before you offer to shake someone else's hand.
Did you just call them Ms 😂😅
Funny, well acted
Sounds right!
"Rooftop cornhole sesh boss!"  The difference here is that THEY get the job done.
I liked your Office Space reference.  "What would you say... you do here?"
I love the Office Space format!
Notice that AFTER Musk dumped useless people, every other tech company did the same. Of course, they didn't get crapped on like Musk did, because he supports free speech.
Give her a job  in HR, just had a half hour of bullshit involving coloured boxes with core values for the company for each colour and a list of positive word to select. Got to watch an overpaid positivity employee gush about how things are improving. Then I got to go back to my 12 hour night shift, that leaves me aching. Sorry to vent.
Oh man, when she said "we've decided to go in another direction." It would have been gold if she asked him to leave. "Yeah, so I'm going to need you to leave my office now. That'd be great."
Was that BLACK HAND?!
Haha, Elon's first e-mail at twitter was hillarious: Everybody who has done some real coding during the last three months gather at the upper floor friday afternoon. Bring evidence of your work.
Y’all missed a golden opportunity to have her say, “This job isn’t for me,” while still being astonished that she would no longer be receiving a paycheck.
😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏
Unrealistic.  People like that would have put their pronouns on their CV, and on that basis they would have been binned straight away without even granted an interview.
This has been done already and much better than this video.  Stupid video.
I keep watching this... If I hadn't seen the video of an actual twitter worker... O... M... G! Great work Bee!
And these were the idiots in charge of public discourse
What the f is Cornhole sesh mean ??? Anybody???
well, manual labor was offensive now so they use "theynual". lol
Just went on a Babylon bee parody binge watch 😂
I just can't believe those people were genuinely getting paid for that, while I rush around town fixing computers and accounting for every hour on my company's database. And my farmer friends during harvest do 15 hour days to feed those pathetic people.
The door is right behind you.
Comedy is better.
FJB and his Natzi’s!
Yep, that’s about right. 😂😂😂
These are the exact people who be running our country in 20 years. PRAY HARD DAILY
This is the most unfunny thing I've ever seen
Liberals actually think everything just exists it just shows up apartment building poof the lgbt fairy created it poof money comes out of air poof
where I worked at a furniture factory. had a new employee come threw the door. look around and left.
“Work force”, 😂😂😂, more like Fuck off force.
Wow when she said cornhole session i was thinking of something far different then throwing bean bags at holes.
How true, how true.
im with her. the less fucking work the better
And that’s why Gen z fails
That is the truth of the new generation
People don’t  realize that “cornhole”did not mean a game  In the old days.
I can't tell if this is a skit or not 🤔
I don’t expect you to come to work, or get any work done and I DONT EXPECT TO PAY YOU OR KEEP YOU ON AS MY EMPLOYEE
These people be like "I SuFfER fRoM AnXIetY oN ThE JoB"
Those degrees in Women Studies are worthless. HR dept or bust.
How about three years in the army?  Their track record for turning turds like her into new prodctive people is amazing.
Twitter has real jobs? Software engineers??
❤
I couldn’t last through the entire video. Thats how great and accurate the acting in this production is
So scary, yet so true...
twitler
Plenty of crying scarves at universities across North American..
Dunsensson and Sons 😂 The attention to details 😂😂
I love her Baruk-Hai hardoo!
Precisely.
Are we ready to admit the fact that people like this are 99.9% rich kids?
That one's for Elon 😅✌️
I am a white guy who works at a 7/11 apply for a job at Twitter but never got it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 another delusional product of WOKISM !!
Has anyone else noticed that since the Twitter layoffs that the level of service at fast food joints and coffee houses has really gone downhill?
lol
This young lady plays the Millennials and Gen Z generations perfectly. She should get an Oscar!
100%. but she has clothes and food and rent - cz daddy, your princess cant find work, please pay my bills till i grow up. parents still thinking she is 14 - pay away thinking their daughter is going out into the world looking for work. pfft. more like getting drilled by chads and having these types of interviews.
I live and work in a really liberal city, and in a young busy area. No one anywhere talks like this. This is an unhappy Christian fantasy.
This skit is hilarious...in 2022.  Oh!  Watching it now, in 2025, it's super-slow paced and the "edge" is definitely DULL now. Sorry.
90% of the Twitter workforce fired and no discernible change. Can we do this for every industry?
Yep... typical Gen Z...
She’s fired before she’s hired.😂😅
Loved it.
Most of those laid off weren't like this... The comments here so judgemental.
Love the bee! Keep doing what you guys do. The world needs more of this.
It's actually pretty sad because 90% of that generation is exactly like that
The throwback to Office Space was fantastic.
I am hiring crybabies seriously 😒
LMFAO - Excellent real life job employee advertisement  -  " we "  are going in a different direction...
Enjoyed the twist at the end. :P
Draft her into the Marine Corps.
This would be hilarious if it wasn’t so true.
I never worked at Twitter and act the complete opposite and it’s even harder to get through an interview Lol
Oh, okay. This was SUPPOSED to be really stupid...
I was actually expecting her to fire the boss, or call HR on him or something.
Lady hit the road bye bye
U better be on time lady or hit the road ?
"Applies For First Real Job". REAL is the telling part of that.
I had one of those.  The guy was supposed to show up at 2:45. He was a no show. Tried to call him at home, got no answer. He showed up around 4:30. I asked if he had an emergency.  He said, “no, I decided to mow my yard this afternoon”.  I told him that he was required to be at work at a certain time. He actually said, “what’s the big deal, I’m here now”.   He was fired shortly after.
In her case being a Hooker would be too demanding.
Funny, how is Twitters value going? Ohhh that’s right lol 😂
She sounds like Maynard G. Krebbs' illegitimate grand daughter, without the wisdom.
Maybe try working for an industry that provides value to society, not one that is actually accelerating our extinction.
Twitter employees fall under the same envelope as NFL,MLB,NBA and NHL players who get cut, ditch diggers! Useless to siciety as a whole, if 2020 did one thing, it proved how useless 100% of Pro Sports actually are. without, the world keeps on turning.
Government takes them all! Up to e-political commissar position!
Double up votes.
Loved this…great video!
"Remanent..."  Perhaps she meant "remnant"?
hee-hee-larius!!!
cringe
Health and safety started this #ImpatientTrader
Spot on. Useless snowflakes. 😂
It's funny to see this in May of 2024 after musk has laid off 15K employees at his automotive facilities. I bet it hits different now you sack sniffing maggot.
That pretty well sums it up
Job at The Civil Service in the UK
Guarantee there's people exactly like her interviewing right now. Such strong GenZ vibes.
I bet it ain’t her first time doing cornhole
I love her😂
I only hope Elon sees this so he can have a good chuckle, too.
I almost pee on my self form laughting out loud.... you got my sub.
Unimaginable in the 70s, joke in the 90s, reality in the 20s.
It’s actually depressing how accurate this is. These are the people deciding what opinions are allowed or not. Orwells thought police.
First ones to perish when every social services breakdown AND when the S.H.T.F. 😂
Documentary
Missed opportunity to accuse them of sporting “Black Hand”😂
This didn’t age well…. 😂
Twitter employees learn lots of useful skills during their  Russian spy training
with that mindset,how does she afford to buy clothes?
She can always get a job with the DNC or MSNBC.
So hilarious.
Did not laugh until the ending. The ending was chuckle worthy.
Elon destroys every company he touches.
Great skit.
It's funny because it's true
She should try getting a job in the army, they will sort her out. Or have her KIA, whatever is cheapest!
You guys are funny as shlt.
Nothing on the hundreds of Palestinians being slaughtered - 40K plus innocent ciovcilians - nbothging from ballon bee - I guess you're not as funny as you thought you where - correct my grammar I dare you
You'd be surprised how true this skit is ...😳
She's ready for politics.
She is really stuck on corn hole.......could mean two different things depending on where she is from....
1:04 intonation right out of Office Space's Bob and Bob "what would you say... you did there?"
The most unrealistic part of this sketch is that the boss was actually trying to avoid using the word "work."
I know lot of the stuff from the The Babylon Bee is satire, and it is way too funny, it is even funnier than the content from over-the-air television, which I no longer watch.
Sad part - this is not only at Twitter. Finally someone with a pair stuck having a good work ethic is important.
Would be funny if not so true
Only thing missing is showing up with her White Liberal Karen mother 1 and White Liberal Kenni mother 2/or Beta Psuedo male; same difference! Nice Yob!
I really hope these privileged, arrogant condescending self-righteous hypocrite divas experience real life soon. Some young people are necessarily bad, just incredibly misguided. The sooner they experience the real world, the better for society.
😂😂😂😂😂
Corn hole had a dark meaning when I was young!
Why is Twitter employees looking for work when they have no real work experience 😂😂 anti American propaganda and protests are only thing they know about 😂
She should try to make a living getting corn holed
Nice Office Space reference @ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g-voQsFY6SE&t=1m5s
There is absolutely nothing this loser is qualified for, except being material for pot hole filler on damaged roads.
My workplace had a sign listing: “What to do when there’s nothing to do.”
It’s so hard to remember that the “libs” are actually actors making fun of real libs 😂😂
She will continue to collect unemployment
These women in twitter, like most other working women, held the most useless jobs ever. All they did was talk about the "patriarchy and oppression" and had their $200 lunches.
Oh man.  I bet this generated SO much love.  :)  Brilliant.  She was brilliant.  He was very understanding, empathetic…
*00:48** LMFAO! The reaction to the word work.*
The bad part about this is that doors will continue to fall off planes because these people are in our work force.  The good part about this is I'll have job security until I don't want to work anymore.
"Job job."
The grease would have setup the perfect Blackface joke. Working with grease Being racist and all

The uncomfortable clap after the AA thing is so accurate for everyone that ISNT in a cult 😂

😂😂😂
Ironic that this video plays on YouTube. A google owned left biased outlet that censors, shadow bans, outright bans "wrong thinkers". Twitter's political interference and narrative may be gone but YT is still at it... I wonder how long this post will last???
She's cute.
Does Babylon Bee take request like a radio station?    If acting like a Karen were an Olympic sport, “The View” would win Gold.  Maybe there could be a video of female athletes, all of them have the same name, Karen. We see them training in the gym, doing all the sorts of things a competitive athlete would do in their regiment, such as their diet, writing down goals and posting it on their bathroom mirror, etc.  They watch “The View” almost every day.
Twitter? Isn't that every woman 18 - 30 years old since, IDK, 1970? Like, you know? The last time I saw a woman doing anything in industry was neverago.
She Might as well start Selling that Ass   not that it's worth Much.
So good I up voted it twice!
Definitely CEO candidate there - She's obviously way over-qualified for any sort of useful endeavor. Maybe something in the political/media category - I definitely would never hire her to do anything which could conceivably any positive material contribution to a going business enterprise.
Do one on Scum Bag George Stephanopoulos   link to Epstein.
A year later....and it STILL holds up.
"What would you say you DID there?" Mmm..yeah..go labor at Inetech😂
Good reference to 'Office Space' there...
2:45 i thought she was freaking out about the ring on his hand XD 3:07 i thought it was cause he mis-gendered her when he said miss XD
I thought it was going to end like: - We don't say the word job either... + Right. You are not required to come to the factory, you can be at home or actually, wherever you want. In return, we are not required to compensate you financially for your labor, although we will congratulate you for it. - Are you firing me? + What? We don't use that word! 🙃
The Silicon Valley millennial.
Her acting is so spoiled brat on point that I can't finish a 3 min video 😂🤣
Shout out to the "Office Space" tribute
This is one of my favorite babylon bee videos.  Yes it's extreme but I have interviewed people who are very similar.
I have to ask: Are those trigger word things legit? Like, obviously trigger words for these people are real things, but are they that crazy? Like, is work, demanding, and expect really trigger words, or are those exaggerations?
Shoutout to the Office Space reference
Ha! Where did you get Fruitport Michigan from because that’s crazy random. Greetings from Fruitport btw!
100 out of 10 lol. Very nice video!
You know  its good, when you already know its a skit but it still pisses you off.😅
loooooool
3:06 Did he just assume her gender??
The sense of entitlement with some people is fucked.
Oh my god I am so glad I subscribed
I didn't like that end bit. That stuff is part of no real job anywhere.
Yes, all true. But Musk IS an evil billionaire. Is he as evil as Bezos? Tough call.....
isn't elon hiring them back though? lmaoooooooooooo
Something tells me fired Twitter employees and those who don't pay back their student loans are one and the same.
she cute
I'm laughing so hard, thank you for just being..........
Cornhole must mean something totally different than it used to. Back in the day, it was slang for a**l s*x. The mental images I get from hearing "cornhole session" is not pleasant.
Iceland has 375k people as total population, over 100,000 females went on strike, about 25%of its population, demanding equal pay and equal rights. Do you know what happened to Iceland? Nothing. Meaning their jobs has no affect on society, as in useless jobs.
No AI will spare you from the reality
Funny shit, I was just talking to a Sr. VP in HR the other day and she was telling me when Musk fired a bunch of Twitter employees, the company we work for interview three of four former employees. From what she said, the shit they were demanding was wild and completely out of line, on top of the of fact they didn't really meet expectations for the job(s) they were interviewing for. On the first phone conversations they wanted to talk pay, working from home indefinitely in writing, healthcare 100% paid for by company, 6 weeks PTO, new MAC Pro laptop, Mac Desktop computer for home/remote work, new apple cell phones, sign on bouse of 20k+, some asked four-day work weeks, extra PTO just for "mental health days." As you might guess none were given a second interview, actually the HR director cancelled all the other interviews with people who had twitter on their resume.
Time to do a new video where the job applicants helicopter parent comes into the interview with them so that they dont have an anxiety attack
The truly sad thing is that this should be a parody or satire but it isn't !!!!!!
I got a new job working in Govt. On the first day I didn't make a good impression.  Just after a morning meeting at coffee break I was glancing out the window. We work on the 7th floor.  My boss came over and chastised me for looking out the window. He said "no looking out the window in the morning, otherwise you won't have anything to do in the afternoon".
This is a clear example of mass Stockholm syndrome.
We have a lightweight on a mechanical engineering course in sub rural Texas. Usually on a Wednesday and Thursday we would have the practical Hands On part. This guy literally asked if he could just watch as he had just had his nails done for the weekend. We were flummoxed, one of the local instructors asked his wife if she knew anywhere a man would be able to get his nails done nearby. The reply was if he walked in any nail shop within 50 miles of here he would get a salt slug up his ass! Needless to say he ended up with an office position in California!
Good ole Elon
I was born in the 60s and I just love the use of 'Trigger Words'.  Really ?  Is there any word that doesn't trigger you ?
Mandy could be on Myfreecams
That's why the banks when bust out there. Those people had clean out their savings  to keep up their life style. No grasp of reality.
....wtf is a cornhole session.....i have a guess but i really hope its not as rainbow as im thinking lmao
This should titled - a generic young person looks for a job.
I sincerely hope that this is an accurate depiction of my competition in the job market.
Sadly this is gen z
I know someone who was responsible for hiring nurses for a school district.  She had more than one applicant ask if they could work remotely....a school nurse working from home....let that sense of entitlement and complete ignorance of the real world set in.
When she asked what was on his hand I half expected her to point out the wedding ring instead of the grease.
This video made Jack Dorsey cry
The firm is lucky that they weren't sued for assuming her gender...
Humanity has evolved, just backwards
If she published a PhD thesis written entirely by A.I., applied black-face (but claim to be from Canada), and used word salad to imply the holacaust was a hoax, then BAM!! She could be the President of Harvard. She should be able to do all that on her phone.
Democrats make American youths weak
😂😂😂😂😂
She has a degree in ' lesbian dance theory' so she thinks she's oppressed.
Cornhole???? What do they mean by?
😮😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
0:36 "miss are you ok?" - I'd say "what is this? .... do you have health conditions?"
She is a good example of how people in society have become so damn stupid
20 min. late . just leave your resume in the round file !
...
What’s sad is that I know this is parody, but her mannerisms, responses, and overall attitude were completely believable. Look up the girl who asks for accommodations for “time blindness.”
I caught that Office Space Easter egg: "What would you say you do here?" Well played, Bee.
1:09 - Nice 'Office Space' reference. - Well Bob...
DID YOU NEED to make it as loud as as screaming Car dealer???????  DO NOT RECOMMEND CHANNEL. DISLIKED.
You guys kill me.
most unrealistic thing is that he called her "miss" without her OH I MEAN they throwing a tantrum
Welcome to the real world, baby.
Coming soon Two-faced book      B🎭K
Great documentary.
I Love the Office Space reference "So what would you say, you did there?"
FA-Q GEN Z
Shes gonna call HR
So realistic.
I wonder how all the fired big tech folks are doing today?
at least she is cute. il have her voting trump real fast. in fact, she would be screaming daddy trump
This woman speaks of the game corn whole. I don't believe I would ever play this game. In my day corn whole was the term used for what two homosexual men did to one another.
sarcasm?
gas attendants?
This is a job… 😂
You have no idea , how is to work 8-12 hours a day, all days of week, without any benefits. And with huge pressure of the bosses. That is home office, some days I do not sleep, ,
There’s a wholesome and very good talent pool out there of genuine talent who are being overlooked.
What about government employees?
She can afford to refuse a job she does not like, that's a win for her.  How many of you can? LOL. Closure was spot on, a boss who tries to shake hands with dirty hand is a red flag.
this video turns a year old
what the hell is twitter
Now they are mods on REDDIt
Mop up specialist at the local steam and cream.
So good 😂
Jaciinda Funny ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
So 80 hour work weeks are acceptable to you folk? I'm just wondering where the line is between reasonable and unreasonable
Nobody asked but imgoing to say it anyways.  Im transgender and i "do stuff" in the energy industry (oil and methane)  these people are truly useless.
oh man. this is bad
ewe tube is trying to ban me now, i dont really have a channel, just tons videos i watch daily, and they didnt say why they doing it, it was just a warning..........
It's funny because it's so damn accurate. Well except for the cornholing I imagine.
An boss would immediately say "you 20 minutes late... well we have check your application and we will contact you later, thank you for your time" ("your late... your fired do not waste my time")
And now the censorship is back :D
AA shout-out  marvelous
When the guy raised his hand showing "5", I though she would assume that was a supremacist symbol.
WTF?  Was that a demonic eyed Biden mug?
I always LOVE watching this one !!  For as absurd and over-reacted as she was, she's really not that far off the stupidity of today's liberals
Largest employer is the federal government. 3 letter agencies need to be downsized etc
I just read that Twitter has laid off 75% of there work force since Elon took over!
As someone who works in a factory, I can say it's a very nice place to work.
Ohh thanks guys, you are here to remind me common sense still exists
I miss Mandy
great
Haha
20 minutes late yeah we don't need you on to the next one😅
JESUS! IF I CAN HIT A MILLION LIKES I WOULD😂 BABYLON BEE NEVER FAILS TO HIT MY FUNNY BONE HAHAHA!
{{{YOUR-FIRED}}}… 🤣
With a wide genuine smile you can get away with almost anything anywhere except when there are rules you don’t follow like on the workfloor
When you hire somebody who cannot help you, its not the employees fault. Like u hired Trump to get rid of ObamaCare, and he failed. It was not his fault.
Elon Musk is a "closet racist". His own words and deeds and hiring practice prove it. Allowing white supremacist to advertise on his X platform. Elon Musk, born in South Africa "apartheid" society, his friends and family alike, apartheid all. Elon Musk is a Trump clone.
This one was pretty bad.
Its just common GenZ problem
Mandy is much too gifted intellectually to be starting below her dignity with the unenlightened, “hoi polloi.” I think Mandy should start in a more rarefied position, such as a bank president.
I found your content very cerebral and uplifting.
Cornhole + drinks are a-o-kay as long as you ALSO DO YOUR FRIGGING JOB!  lol.
...and there is no "wage gap". If women did EXACTLY the same work (number of days/hours worked per week, etc.) in the same job that a man did, they would get paid the same. Feminist, you would be happier having kids and staying home with them.
All workers under 30 are basically like this person.
In India , most of the IT companies has this same type of women employees. And all the real stuff is get done by men as usual.
Youtube also needs to be “twittered”.
Bet she supports UBI😂
well, good for Elon then.
My aunt worked at a factory for years until she could retire. She hated it and left as soon as she could retire.
The kicker: she is 19 😂
Why is this exactly what I was looking for 😂
This guy was great! As the feminist husband. It was great.
only if all of them were like this but No truth is Actually EVEN WORSE 😂
SPEAKING FROM YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PROVED: NEVER EEEVVVEEEERRR EVER HIRE OR MENTOR OR PROMOTE ANY WOMEN. IF YOUR GOAL IS SUCCESSFULL COMPANY ALWAYS HIRE AND MENTOR AND PROTECT AND PROMOTE ONLY MEN AND BE SHAMELESS ABOUT THAT AND YOUR COMPANY WILL PROGRESS AND FLOURISH.
Uselees human
Instant like and sub!  When the actress breaks the fourth wall about the chip, and the very end  "I got the mimosas!"
Makes me think about YouTubers who self claim to be in a full time job 😂
All of this Hurt my feelings.
The End 😂
Satire, or actual job interview wit a woke Gen Zer? 🤔
Don't really must be an Twitter employee. It happens everywhere 😂😂😂 fucking millennials
If you are not trying to run a glorified activist organization, Twitter just needs a few employees to run it. E.Musk.
Work done i mean stuff done i mean labour 😅😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's hot she could get into pron
In 10-15, maybe 20 years after the  most  or the boomers and Gen Xers have left the work force, who is going to be the engineers, air traffic controllers, doctors, scientists, road builders, construction workers, utility crew workers, oil rig workers, farmers etc,etc, etc...you know, the people that make a country operate like a first world country?
I caught that Office Space reference. "What would you say ya did there?". Perfect 😅
In this world, many people earn so easily on the sweat of others and will just appreciate them to make them feel good while they take most of the goodies.
Bam!
AS a German I ask for one favour and one favour only: Please. PLEASE. Keep your stupid people and your culture(?!) (feels akward, to treat serious psychological damage on society scale as a "perk") well away from the eastern shore of the very big water we here call the Atlantic. Pacific region is fine, they act as a firewall. Thank you very much.
😂😂😂😂😂
Very good video 👍
This is the reality of many tech companies 😂. 20% got to do the whole work
I’m not on twitter. Is Babylon Bee really banned?
I have no idea what a "corn hole sesh" is.
LOL 😆 Love it!
Is Twitter hiring again? I'd like to apply
I know it's a joke and I'm not supposed to hate her but I can't help it.
Funny and true
Is that a black hand 😊
I have no idea what is cornhole fish, and what is in a mimosa. . . . . .
Whilst bob from accounting has been  just sacked because  he  is contemplating suicide  and  company used this as excuse to  sack him as they don't have to tell him but as long as Becky gets to to ban people...
Remember the dumb girls that streamed themselfs going to Twitter and actually showing us how the place works. Pretty spot on
Office space vibes. Love it
I know it would hurt but this economy just needs to blow up already.
Hey its where i work. But she be hired and my boss in a week.  While doing nothing guess where company is from one guess.   Sadly im old and taught responsibility and good work ethic.
I work at the big pharmaceutical giant and they are exactly like this. Meetings about meetings. So much NON value added employees. Very sad.
This is closer to reality than satire.
She belong to the street
Dear Dog, what have we raised?
So thrue
Drank like sailor and AA
any programmer that worked for twitter and knew what they were doing got another job as soon as they wanted to.
the end made it even better.
Twitter was full of these parasites. Elon did the world a favor by disinfecting Twitter.
Just another reason why you should aim to be your own boss.
These are the rainbow idiots that moderate posts... KaPOW
Praise the LORD always and Forever! To HIM be the glory!
😂😂😅😅
Lol, absolutely hilarious.  You made my day.
Great acting and well put together.
You forgot to touch on the lgbtq rights stuff
My morning laugh for the day. Loven it!!!
I just….. I could save you people that think this is funny. But you’d call me the same names that the people portrayed by this woman in the video would call you.  In some ways, you are worse than her. I was once one of you.
Careful guys. Don't let identity politics warp your notion about real improvements in the time we spent or not in a workplace. If you can get the job done remotely, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NEED FOR THE COMMUTE.
Absolutely hilarious and funny.
Excellent actress!!
44Bn is the price paid for freedom of speech - Elon Musk
Odds on that she is still a virgin.
Any AI or monkey can do her job
After that failed interview Meta threads team hired her and now Musk is screwed.
is that the person that build threads ? did a great job then :)
0:57 That look of transient suppressed anger is perfect.
This is funny.
😂cmon yall. I work for one of these tech companies and actually do stuff i swear. Still pretty funny though !😆😂
I laughed so hard at 2:10 lolololol as someone who never got a Covid break, it was hilarious and ridiculous at the same time seeing all these zoomers whine about how cruel it was to expect them to come back to the office after working from home.
Probably made six figures at Twitter too
Dude, content moderation, I mean real content moderation is very tough on people doing it. It is not handled by social media companies directly but by subcontractors who employ people from poor companies and pay them not even peanuts. And these people have to constantly deal with lots of gory, sick, abusive stuff and filter that out. Many of them don't even get 20 dollars for whole day's work.
Ridiculous! Lol! Awesome video
Imagine.. Twitter is still working fine.. shows that how much it was over staffed with entitled woke employees.
I love these guys.
This is almost believable 😂😂 Some of the college kids we get at work aren't far off from this
Finally. @Youtube allowed this video to cross 4M views
Hi
Maynard G. Krebs... WORK????
I'm assuming y'all are husband and wife - she is the funniest in this episode! God bless you and yours!
Newby to you guys, but got to say "I'm lovin' it"🤪😆🤣
My mom taught me - and Elon confirmed it in his first BB interview - many truths are spoken in jest - mocking these lefties is actually biblical and justified - Elijah is one of the best examples!
Never trust a skinny chef or a mechanic with clean hands.
Champagne Socialists claim to be for the working class until they actually meet someone from the working class lmao
With this status, some criminals like Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, with all evidence of high profile corruption and drug abuse, or the other Clinton criminals are untouchable for law enforcement! I don’t think that the USA deserves to be the leading nation!
The USA is now a mad house, a mental ill sanatorium and nobody cares!!!
The day after Elon Musk fired half of Twitter's employees, the day went off without a hitch. Nobody noticed any changes in the work done, and nobody missed any of the ex-employees.
Spot on !
The best line in this, "Oh, it's a job job."
Dang…. I wish i got interviews this easy.    The only thing i can assume is that she had a family member connection that he had to interview on purpose for.
Hilarious 😂
I will hire Twitter employees to clean my dogs poop.cause they aren't qualified to clean up poop of human being.
this is a throw away comment to never be seen again
Unforetunately this is a sad truth! I worked at a company like this! These are the type of twisted twits DEI helps in their companies! No accountability!
Mandy needs to go into politics......
So few Americans actually work that TV shows about people working are very popular.
Oh god this is how I feel when I hear customers go into Home Depot. They be like, whaaaaaat?!?!? What do you mean I have to fix my own toilet by myself or pay and exorbitant price for a plumber.
I haven't worked in Twitter or any FAANG company, but people need to realize the perks these companies offer were meant to keep the employees at the office for longer hours + keep them happy cuz happy employees make a ton of money. Also these ppl are usually the brightest folks...they might seem crazy but the profits speak for themselves...you don't get paid based on your labor, but how much value you bring, simple as that
I think I'm in love.
the real question is why did she keep saying "we"
I mean, lets think for a second. What else would the Twitter Staff have been doing? They developed literally nothing over the years, there was never any major performance or UI changes, NOTHING at twitter would have required so many staff members, other than when they are 24/7 moderating and silencing people on the platform. They most definitely did not work at all and that helped contribute to the huge money lose. Elon Firing these people gave thema lesson to actually work to live and forced them to contribute to society. So he deserves some credit.
Would have told her to leave instantly.
I'd like to see these mythical super important extremely d8fgicult return from work bloody every day jobs everyone talks about.
LOL!
😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“What would you say you did there?” Straight from Office Space lol
Love the Office Space tribute "What would ya say . . . ya did there?"
I spoke about God on twitter and they took me off and so I said , watch God take them down and he did like he had a grizzly devour that arrogant man in Alaska after he took his son's name in vane you see God just dried up the Euphrates and released the four horseman to the east to Gog and Magog like he said he would do and if he says the gate is wide to hell and many there will enter you people can't see how powerful he is , he owns everything you are just temporary holders temporary you think god doesn't exist think again
It's a job job... hahahaha
Ima just say if you don’t need a wire brush and fast orange to wash the who knows what from lord knows where you did the job wrong or your career choice is fucking boring and i will have no part in it I make more money haveing the time of my life than any of those office drones
Very very accurate of these people. Not even an exaggeration
...and that's how Twitter went from 8,000 to 1,000 employees...thanks Elon.
I'm confused why are people treating ex tiwtter employees as useless?? What did I miss
When I hire people at my job this is the first thing they ask is do I actually have to come in and if you say anything that sounds like work they're not interested
I've heard of a dissaplanary assistant. At local school. Weird me out.
I think Ive seen a video of an ex twitter employee crying because he has to work 6 hours a day and he wasn't used to working with actual physical customers complaining lol
Btw, she'd be a disgrace to AA.
A re-interview at Twitter now EM has cleaned house
More reality than fiction! 😂
I was good right up until the end; at which time I had to go running out of the room heaving the way Mandy did.
Her acting so good i cringe so hard
That's just the whole millennials veiw on work we let our education system poison a whole generation they will wake up but it will be too late for their own prosperity
get a real job
Great video, in Latin America we say those people never grabbed a shovel in their lives...
There is never something worser happened to aa than wokenes and cancelculture
2x the workforce for the same production and women take half the pay = insane cost of living
Actually I'm starting to be like them and staring to like this approach.  AI will take our jobs anyway so I'm starting to don't care 🤷‍♂️
If she promises not to speak for some 10 minutes I think a good spanking will bring her around. Send he over, I'll get right on it.
Love your Chanel and the content. The actors and actresses are great. Please keep up the good work.
3:14 I do not judge her character for having this reaction. She might indeed be a little bit of a germaphobe, and that's not bad. She will however need to overcome it in order to get stuff and other jobs done. Sorry, but not sorry for using this harmless trigger word.  Plus, she was never being rude or impolite to the boss directing the interview. She's still a useless piece of work, but never was she obnoxious.
months later. still makes me smile.
Imagine that .. What kind of illusion have the left created.
Hahaha! So real! :D
the funny thing is, twitter really did have beer fridges, and really did do half days every friday to throw a party
Wow this is fantastic!
The only job she can do is being a test dummy for car crash
one of the 80%
in 10 years this will be an historical documentary
God she's so good at acting like a useless Le ft tist that it got on my nerves.
Generation Z in a nutshell :D
Gotta love the ebonics.
Almost too accurate to be funny!
https://youtu.be/ImVepClp5no?t=36
Thanks Elon ! 😂
Elon musk must have thrown up in his mouth repeatedly dealing with those nitwits
Keep them coming. Great entertainment.
What is sad is that this might all be true for all we know.
Well she can come work for me. Ok do stuff for me. Oh wait, she would actually have to do work for me. Sorry Mandy.   Frankly, this had me giggling, I know a few like her.
Twitter was a heaven for Woke people and now they have to find work and it’s new hell for them
Awesome
Accurate.
She’ll sue
she/her
Brilliant!
She dodged a bullet on that one
I didn’t see the end coming. That was funny
Babylon Bee attempts first real joke.  But fails
@Kenneth Dang Bro if you wanted to avoid the real work while still getting a fat paycheck you should have gone to one of the private, near ivy league liberal arts schools and majored in gender studies, African diaspora, art history or something like that. Become content moderator doing 3 hours work per day..boom, done.
I see Twitter on a resume, and that's an automatic non-hire. I employ hard workers with a moral compass. Lazy, self entitled brats have no place on my payroll.
Twitter before Elon must have been a fairy land. I only say this due to so many crying after being let go on the net. All the complaining I saw and read.Guess the Big Bucks are now trying to do Real Jobs like Mcdee Wendys Burger King. Opps. Is this the reason Burger King shutting down so many Stores? ow such whimps. And to think they are now in General population.
Workers of the world snipe at each other. You have nothing to lose except your time.
One of your best, bravo :D
2:11 He blows it here like a wuss by refusing to say 'work' because of her dopey reactions. He's a sellout, not a real boss, so it ruins the skit.
She can join the Army.
Love the Office Space reference.
What will really cheesed me off is some of these turds we’re making 100k or higher in salary..  Thank you Elon for leveling the playing field by sending these wokesters back to  what they are worth…..minimum wage
NEVER Demand from or ask a Zoomer to do anything, unless you want to be labeled and shamed on social media for being a repressive Nazty Terump Supporter. Zoomers will show up if and when they want and will ONLY do the tasks that they feel comfortable doing. Otherwise they find it safer to stay at their single mommy's house Tweeting and smoking weed. Change My Mind
Google employees are probably far worse.
its called WORK ya lazy ass loosres
haha ...... loosers these days
I think we are about a year a way from business realizing anyone who is a millennial that went to college is pretty much useless at a job and not being willing to hire anyone who is young w a degree
She's gorgeous 😍
Compared to the Idiots at Budlight she looks like Einstein
Hey, they used a line from Office Space.
Dude really shouldn’t be wearing a wedding ring if he’s playing with machines. Could lose a finger.
Hell the one thing I thought she'd say was I didn't see a safe space LOL.
Don't worry, Mandy...The Guardian, NY Post, CNN, Washington Post, Channel 4, BBC etc are hiring!
😂😅
OMG are they painting their hands black to ridicule black people?
I wonder if any twitter employees watched this, and if so, what are you thoughts?
"Yeah, so I'm going to need you to just go ahead and leave my office, and if you could just not come back that would be great, m'kay?"
Fake  She's not morbidly obese.
Fired half it's employees - lost half it's value -  25 Billion GONE #GoTrumptardGoBroke - If that muppet had an education he wouldn't wearing his name on his uniform... Tell me again about the baristas and gas station attendants. People were not banned by that woman pressing a button, they use an algorithm. An algorithm beyond you comprehension even if you spent the rest of your life trying to understand it...
I wonder how many Snowflakes now know that the whole world is laughing at them.
Hahaha 😂
#BoycottBud #BoycottNIKE
"We" have decided to go in another direction... "We" who? Bipolar personality? Royal "We" (entitleness)? 😆
This is absolutely real. Funny in this skit, but not funny in reality. The Bay Area is full of useless, formerly overpaid tech workers that are in for a rude awakening.
Not only Twitter, I dread to think what TikTok staff are like or even YouTube employees, but this seems to be symptomatic of anyone born GenZ
You completely missed the opportunity to turn the grease trope into cultural appropriation, black face (hand), etc.
Nice office space reference in there.
Trying to be funny at the same time as gaslighting political fixations is not funny.
This reminds me of a situation a relative is facing.  One of his reports just hired five graduates whose only previous job was working in a bank.  This is in a trucking firm.  They have,  of course,  been playing hillbilly politics - white anting people two levels up etc.  My relative is just going off on a few months leave.  I would be surprised if the truckies don't rip those little toerags limb from limb by the time he gets back. Sometimes its best to just smile and wave.
Love the office space reference. The bobs!
This would be funny but unfortunately this is reality today so sad
Great video. Excellent ending. Thanks for the humor :D
I had to look up what a corn hole session was...
"BuT iT wAsN't PeRfOrMaNcEd BaSeD!!!!"
Little nod to Office Space there.
This is dumb.  This one is hilarious:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo0KjdDJr1c&ab_channel=DreamReachMedia
I see most here accept the conditions at work that people like Elon want, Lol. You guys would be the first ones complaining about those conditions if you worked ina place like he runs it Lol.
so her job at twitter wasn't real?
What exactly are reminints? I know what remnants are.
Very funny when actual baristas and petrol station attendants are thinking about how Twitter is nest for useless snowflakes. Twitter was successful, so probably its set up and hierarchy was quite good.
Go Elon, job well done!
Maybe do one on an Anheuser-Bush marketing VP looking for a job...
Liberal snowflakes
I am wondering how much experience the people who are saying this is a right depiction of twitter employees have around working it tech or particularly twitter. Sure there are some perks bit mostly to steal employees from competitors but there are works to be done and you need to put long hours depends on the project and team. Sure there are people and that not doing much but saying “employees” in general not doing anything and be happy people losing their jobs is just mean.
You guys are fantastic. Thank you for the laughs
This is true of today's generation's with a lot of people
Workforce VS Wokeforce ... 🤯
Ha ha so funny NOTTTTTT!!!
If this is true then good job Elon 👍
“Rooftop cornhole sesh!” 😂  You guys are incorrigible. I love it!😍
Real job? Jealous much😂?
They should learn how to weld
I think we must thank the Unionized Public School system for the fine product graduating now! The Country is sooooo fu*ked. Please take back your local school Board from indoctrination clinic.
Just say NO to WOKE!
Thank you Elon, to get rid of 99% of douches. 😂
Wow they are all unemployed or back into the same doomed position right now.
“We have decided to go in a different direction.” gets me every time. Emphasis on the schizophrenic ‘we’.
Why is she talking about doing anal at Twitter?
youd think someone whos previous job involved scanning blocks of text for trigger words they would read a job advert
The funny thing is, that this is very close to reality for most of the useless trash Elon fired. I will not even say good luck to them, they don't deserve to work anywhere.
Prob not far from the truth
It's funny because it's true.
we interviewed for an IT position st our company a year ago.  The guy knew his stuff, and we extended offer.  He rejected it. We could only allow 2 days a week remote and 3 onsite.   He wanted only 1 day a week on site.   He was still in covid lock down mind set.....wonder where he ended up?
you guys keep referring to factory / manufacturing / blue collar / minimum wage jobs a little too much in your videos, clearly you guys don't really care about other jobs or businesses and i cant wait for the day when yall would make iphones in America and it would be 10 grand without charger. MAGA all the way!
🤣
impressive how people is so careful with woke problems like saying work, its sth real.
Nothing like a good firm hand shake
Funny but true
wine on tap and AA
Hand of the king has grown tall
I don't this person really wants a job.She shouldn't be hired by anyone.
if you see the videos of their daily work you will be shocked, but the most shocking part is that people who are privileged have no clue they are privileged, those women would later go to women marches complaining how hard their life under the patriarchy! let this idea sink in : rich, have the best food, get money for nothing, gets praises for nothing, celebrates for nothing = oppressed.   it was just a matter of time until the bubble those delusional people built for themselves busted, this is no way to run a company.
If Twitter was a person, she would be the exact personification.
More truth to this than we realize.
There was a report of an ex Twitter employee who committed suicide because every job interview they went on failed miserably. As soon as the perspective employer got a look at their work history with Twitter in which they didn’t even show up for weeks at a time because if “personal issues” the interviews would end. Lol. Moron.
Surprised she did not accuse them of doing "black hand".
Its clear that this is all satirical, but it's not really like this , is it?
AOC. Would have made a top notch twitter employee.  BEFORE Elon took over
I actually once went on a date with a girl like this. It was probably the shortest date in history. I got up and left after about 7 minutes.
Not an ex-Twitter employee but I have definitely been in situations where I got paid to sit around and do nothing, and it was one of the most soul-sucking experiences of my life. Am feeling impressed by Mandy's ability to not feel guilt for contributing nothing to society.
Hahaha this is hilarious! I’m partially handicapped & require several hours of daily physio. I’m returning to work soon and I’m nervous about employers being unwilling to work with me.  But this reminder that THIS is a lot of peoples work ethic makes me feel wayyyy better! Thanks Babylon bee!
Does anybody know the lore on Steve from Fruitport Michigan?

She could probably do vp of the united states.
I know that a lot of young people in the US think like this girl, in real life, and that's why I am confident the US will not be the super power we know soon.
Almost anyone under 30
This is literally what stuff looks like at Twitter. Elon Musk has been conservative with the firings. I can assure you dat.
This is almost certainly how it went down between those people and Elon Musk.
Lol... twitter a such a better place now !!
I think Gen Z or whatever this latest generation of kids are Corn-Holed.  Those poor kids have no prospects, never taught how to work and every one of them thinks they are a special snowflake.  Life is going to be VERY HARD for this entire generation, we better watch our backs, they won't be young and stupid for too long before they are hunting in packs :-(
Love the Bee!!!
Work!  Who is old enough to remember Maynard G. Krebs???
If I own a business and the resume says “work at twitter” or “Netflix” or “Disney” I need to see no more. Or if it has pronouns or the person is a pink haired weirdo?? No thank you. No cancer is allowed in my company.
Sure would be nice if I had a job where I had a gourmet chef making me food, was day drinking, and was playing party games all day. While pulling down a six figure paycheck. Oh, and not actually producing any goods or services.  I could be a professional useless person!
I'm Michael and I'm from ( well close) Fruitport, Michigan! Thanks 🐝 for making us famous!🤪
When people realise that a job means work.
Sounds about right. Lol
“So…what would you say…ya do here?”
ngl this is believable
This explains why my espresso order is always wrong now....
"Before we hire you, just letting you know that you're fired."
Cant tell you how many times i replayed her "banning people sesh"
It's baffling how many female R&D engineers I've seen that only arrange meetings and make presentations.
"What would you say, you did there."   Channeling his best Bob's impersonation.
😂😂.. meditation rooms
This didn't age well since elon musk did a back flip and tried to rehire those fired because they were desperate for skilled staff p.s define REAL job? because its not a brain dead low paying job? you're literally making passive income from youtube monetisation, why are you mocking people losing jobs especially one was a pregnant woman? pps why are you stirring hate? i'm aware its a skit/satire but because ONE brand fked with trump EVERYONE that works there is evil? note: trump was caught backing supporters shouting "white power"
I got the mimosas was the best!!!
Didn't know the Babylon bee was banned from Twitter.... I just got banned from LinkedIn (again) and this time they told it is "irreversible".....   Wow.... how concerned should I be????
So true
Intha job eantha mathri pls reply
https://youtu.be/XPDJKacOwjI jokes
LOL Perfect !!
That is based.
lol....fired the second she was late for the interview.
I would say that´s not only twitter, but lots of women in general.
I am Indian (from India). Love your videos. I am a keen observer of world politics and culture (USA included) and totally feel USA is entering a big mess with the current govt. and the cultural war that is happening against the traditional American values. Totally with you guys in this fight. Lets save the real USA and the World.
This describes perfectly the expectations of recent college graduates.
In all honesty, this work place sounds awesome. Everyone seems to actually work hard. They either have very secret safewords or they can read minds and stick together to preserve a good work place. And after a day's hard work they can all play cornhole and drink mimosas
Am I blind, or is no one here commenting on the Office Space reference at 1:04? 😅
>suggesting that former twitter's employees had any trouble to get a new job in a matter of a week XD But what to expect from rightoids without a touch with reality
A lot of these commenters don't seem to realize BB is making fun of THEM gloating over people being laid off, not laid off Twitter employees.  And of course mass layoffs hurt the economy so the ex-employees bad luck is everyone's bad luck.
She's not kidding about corn holing.
That's pretty savage 😅
This gives me autism with how genuinely fucking dumb this shit is
Infuriating to think there really are people out there getting paid significantly more than me just to do nothing.
"he engages in manual labour" lol
Maybe Only fans or Facial Abuse is more suited for her!
Great
Office Space outtake.  Nice !
I like his little twitch as he struggles to not say her trigger words...
This is a re-enactment of every job interview for your Art or Poetry majors.
Welcome back to the workforce, pussies! 🤣
the interesting thing is that twitter still works after all these layoffs
Love it!🤣
This is reminiscent of my recent experience with modern dating apps. 😅
I'd give her a job
Dumb
Banker
I hope tha this becomes a series... ...though, from your pinned comment, there might already be one.
I thought Musk got cold feet and decided not to buy twitter. You're the ones that follow those soap operas till your fat and dead.
Very funny well made video but at least on their worst days facebook instagram and twitter take some degree of responsibility for their own content like they're supposed to instead of being homo bitches like google. If you're not wanted you're not wanted. All internet sites just replaces newspapers for their content and the newspapers only printed what they wanted to and usually took responsibility for what THEY published. These words are NOT my responsibility, never have been never will be. Google chooses to publish them, they have ALL the control and ALL the money. They're responsible. As far as being a "free speech platform" give me a break. The papers were responsible, so is twitter and so is google for everything on it. Don't ever cooperate with a court that says otherwise even 1%.
I saw a new young guy a few months ago on a construction job quit over being asked to rake asphalt. Apparently they only wanted to drive the equipment around and hated the fact they kept asking him to do manual labor. The foreman wasn't even mad, just amazed.
Imagine thinking this was funny
So a little grease on my hands turns out to be useful for my mental health.
Ok, I got to speak on her only assets.  She's hot.  LOL. Cool skit though, ty.
Cannot wait for the idiots to live on the streets lolz 😆
Thank you Onion, for going woke.
Mandy should be a Child Therapist
This could have been faaaaar funnier. Instead of the interviewer going beta-cuck and giving into her woke BS, just keep using words like "job" and "work" and let her have an epic melt-down.
She actually looks like one of em twitter employees tho 🤣
This could be titled "Actual grownup interviews every millennial ever"
They one guy Jason kirby from North Carolina you know he banned
Fun! Fun! Fun! - All the way!
How about food service. Anything involving beef.
Accurate.
good except she wasn't wearing a mask...
Ivy League College Indoctrinated Idiots have taken over America--Hate God, Country and All History that does not Apply to them...
The twist at the end was gold, haha! No matter where you work, everyone loves a good slack session. ;)
My job's perspective would be this. Twitter employee: So what kind of fancy drinks do you have, hmm? My workplace: There is a coffee machine in the breakroom and packs of coffee ground that is whatever the vending company we have a contract with provides. And you make it yourself. Filters are in the cabinet above the machine.
babylon bee: banned 1:28
That was cute
This is pretty spot on. But also, Elon is an asshole.
Now this applies to Google as well! And probably many other tech companies.
Rewatching this now after I leanrt Google and Meta fired 20.000 people, which were 98% just like her XD
That boss has a patience of a saint, if were that boss I’d be blowing a fuse before she speaks! 🤬🤣
This is the most accommodating boss I've ever seen
LOL
Ma’am It’s not like Twitter basically fell apart after the layoffs and is only being kept together with nick and spit, and still only operates because workers are forced to work double shifts and overtime
Does that mean the service at the majority of restaurants will be even worse with all these woke babies working there and crying about the injustice done to them
Babylon Bee sure does a lot of documentaries.....I wish the Idiocracy documentary wasn't so true
oh my gawd, GREASE? at the place I do stuff to get money? NEVER. just for my hobbies, at work I literally can't have grease, though I do work with a lot of chemicals, in a lab. and yes, this is in part sarcasm, just the questions, the other part is true
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IS TRUE!
Typical lazy women
Any female applying for a job-useless lazy and pampered
Hey I heard of a lab hiring ex twitter people to see the negative effects reality has on their brain.
😆😆😆..that actually sums up alot of young people 😂
This is so true. As a leftist, the Bee has become really funny, on par with The Onion. I also like how both humor outlets are making fun of Biden. Mandy needs to get a job as a server next. If y’all have not seen the 30 other things found in Biden’s garage article on the Bee, it’s hilarious.
I can appreciate the Office Space undertones 😂
I hate when adult videos cut off before the best part.
She might be really good in bed. I'm thinking that's her most redeeming quality.
Great actress. This skit wouldn't be as funny without her.
Twitter HQ operated more or less like a homeless shelter. Free everything for doing absolute jack sh$t
brown M&M remover
They could probably get a job at the FBI
For a moment I almost felt foolish that my hobby as a wiki administrator includes banning users who spam/vandalise wiki article pages. Thank goodness there's more to being a wiki admin than banning people. :P 🙃
Help! I need a twitter expert. When looking at #riptwitter and #breakingnews , I used to be able to select "Latest" along the top, (where you also can select People, Videos....). But now "Latest" is gone. I don't know how to get it back!
I wonder if that idiot twitter employee realizes she’s literally a complete laughing stock?
She is perfect for a democrat Congressman just like AOC
What a dumb-ass she is!
I would just say, you're NOT qualified, GET OUT...
Lazy ass Ex Twitter employees! Elon is a god
How tf is this so accurate lmao
The actress is amazing
30 years ago I was in a Stroh’s ice cream shop and the owner told me how difficult it was teaching high school kids how to scoop ice cream or sweep a floor.  He was very concerned for the future of our country. Here we are….
I know far too many people like this...
You’ve done better.  I would not push this one.
Why would she completely switch careers after being fired from Twitter
Love for Mandy. 💖💖💖
Meh.
i sure hope her first job shoveling clean the stablesbe right up her ally shoveling shit !
Oh this has aged like 1 month old milk in a summer sun. Who'd a thunk it it takes responsible people to keep a platform running correctly. Now it's a borked mess technically functionally.
"Capitlism is evil"-same twitter employee.
Repent of your sins and trust that Jesus died for you!
This video gets more and more 🤣with time.
I started laughing the second the interviewer told the woke entitled twit that she was 20 mins late and she acted like - so what?  Hilarious!
The actress who plays 'Mandy" is absolutely hilarious!
Office Space
Being fired is not fun, It's not easy to pick up a job in a field that is rare.
Nicely done...
Anything in government would suit her like a glove...
Free alcohol? Keep the free booz, and give it to me in cash!
I feel like this would be a sketch straight out of the Office
Mandy's acting is 10/10, she actually manages to annoy me :D Alot... :D
Thanks!
This generation is so doomed. When AI takes over everything, they will literally be as useless as tits on a bull.
I love how butthurt you guys still are. You make social media sketches that aren't funny or clever and you think people with skilled jobs are lazier than you.  Let me repeat, YOU MAKE FUCKING SOCIAL MEDIA SKETCHES 🤣  I would tell you to get a real job but that might hurt your feelings and we all know how sensitive you are.
Good one!
Literal depiction of my sister, who dreams of having a job where you getting paid in exchange of keeping your mental state clear and healthy, because literally toxic oppressive colonialist regime sucks for the working environment and she might need a personal therapist session after that.
She didn't demand severance pay.
I really hate how people think this is how twitter employees are.
In ten years someone like this will be the president of the United States if things don't change.
it's funny but also, sad, because there are actual people like her out there
-person who works at a parody news organization
Okay I thought this was funny
Frames the term 'useful idiot' at a whole notha level
There's a place called the GOVERNMENT where this useless lump would be welcome all she has to do is agree to vote left and she's in like Flint!.. $100k a year with $100k pension at the age 50 retirement.
"BYOG" hahaha that made me burst out laughing.
Why Steve from Fruitport, MICHIGAN? I live around there! Just so random! Anyone have any details why they chose that place?
Brilliant!
I hear she works for Biden now! He really likes the way her hair smells!
Pretty funny, but I'm not sure why you chose to have the interviewer be a little bitch. Being ok with the interviewee being 20 minutes late and going along with her triggers. Yeah, no.
👏👏👏👏👏
Love the kicker at the end. Cornhole and memosa at the factory. Nice job.
😂😂
I ask questions after watching. So why did you lose your job? We didn’t really have a start time.
Lol at the "Mandy Zanderton" name.
Dr Steve from Fruitport MI is one of my very good friends! Ha! I'm dying to know the story of how randomly you choose him in this video!  Dr Steve saw it too and laughed.  We all want to know. Please do tell! 🤣
These dopes need to watch Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe. They would appreciate there pay check every week with I’m sure benefits vacations and much more. For doing what? Now she has to go home  and tell daddy he has to put air in her tire of the BMW because she  don’t know how to. Yuk fingernail dirty.
I consider myself very fortunate to have never met anyone like this. People like this don't exist in real life, right?
"Drank like a sailor!"
What on God's green Earth is a "cornhole sesh" ???
Love the Office Space ref.
This is so funny because that's really the way this generation is. 🤣
Cornhole session. 🤣🤣🤣
Spaghetti noodle counter
this is just a shitty smosh video
It's so sad that this thing is real and not only a comic skit. Not surprising that the west is collapsing. We need adults in the room asap.
I noticed the subtle Office Space references
What job should Mandy seek out next? = Systems Analyst and Head of Equity, Diversity, and Green Work Processes and Procedures
They should have taken her on the roof for cornhole.
How do we get this to all of them??
Hilarious :-) Nobody does it better to expose woke American stupidity than babylon bee.
They should lick moss off of rocks, that's about their level... 😆
There was a LOT of "cornholing" happening at the old Twitter.  Day and night, through elections and lockdowns- it was wine and cornhole.  Mostly in the cornholing public access. areas but not exclusively. That's report anyway.
hahahahahahhahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa go to work and shut up or just starve.
This would be funny if it were not based in so much TRUTH!     No really its funnny.......
I'm pooping right now.
Oh, the horror!
🤣
That's awesome! I wonder if she actually did ban someone when she was there? Hey! Can I get that button she pushes for banning, but to get annoying co-workers to "slide out?"
If I had his level of patience...
I know this is just a parody but I wonder how these people actually function in society in the real world?
Very accurate
Work hard, play cornhole hard.
Walmart greeter.  That's all she is qualified for.
I am so not googling "cornhole sesh"
I’m shocked that her mom wasn’t with her taking over the interview and negotiations. This would be only funny if it didn’t actually happen in real life!
Poor Steve from Michigan:(
"rooftop cornhole sesh" sounds like workplace harassment! The word always brings me back to this scene from Office Space: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHjlM5A1jME
0:55 handwork, lol
I love how white American 304s say "Twitter": "Twirearrr-ah"
That man's patience has patience.
This is so perfect because there are really employees like this out there.
This was crazy funny
The sad part is this supposed to be satire but it is so true
They can all go to China like our oil field workers .
This reminds me of Andrew Tate reacts to elon taking over twitter
Surprisingly I really appreciate the ending, people who actually work earn their Cornhole and drinks.
You guys are what SNL used to be(e)  ;-)
Hahahahahahahaha
#TRUTH and we should all be blaming the fathers
It's scary to think how many resources were spent on these so-called "employees", and so that these rainbow girls and boys could enjoy their smoothies, people from third world countries work hard for a pittance.
Elon Musk is the greatest man alive
I really liked Babylon Bee, but man is this far from clever parody or witty commentary at this point. I'm almost reminded of Studio C in style, it's just tasteless to me and not really all that funny.  I really like the Onion author's submission to the Supreme Court noting that good parody would be indistinguishable from a real headline -- at least for a period of time. This is just...blatantly shoving a political conclusion?  I hope for more from the BB team. Y'all used to be pretty funny to me, now this is dead an uninspired. :'( ;'(
WHO IS THIS WOMAN??? She's perfect! <3 <3
I know it's only a parody but it does fill the in between the lines 'thinking' process of this and the previous generation's idea of what is expected vs what they 'feel' to be expected. I know there are exceptions, our two and most the kids of our siblings are thankfully among those exceptions. On the other hand, one 'chunky' and very spoiled thirty something girl who married into the family pretty much fits the presented model quite well. On top of that, she really likes to believe she is among the savior & compassionate generation. If she actually worked more than two hours a day, (besides losing some of her excessive weight) she would think of ways to sue her employer. NAH!, I'm betting she thinks of it often enough just by being hired.
I love how this is an almost perfect duplicate of the interview between Tom Smykowski and ‘the Bobs’ from “Office Space”. 😂
This was so funny that I laughed my ___ off! The Babylon ___ hits another one out of the ________! Sorry about the self-censored words, just trying to not get my account ______!
Any Twitter employees want to defend themselves here?                  I guess not. Get a real job bitches.
Employee is absolutely pathetic . A weak America  because of these liberal kids .
1:05 I love the nod to "Office Space"
Former employees of Twitter should be permanently Shadow Banned..
She needs a creakier voice and has to use the word “problematic.”
thank god for elon
This video is spot on correct.  Who in the hell is raising these overentitled little POS?
She should probably learn to code.
Is there still manufacturing in the US? Didn’t it all move to Asia 20 years ago?
New CEO of Theranos...Heard they had a couple "openings"...?
Elon your spot on. Taking over a business clean house! Lots of bad apples ✔️
In a better America this kind would be rode out on a rail. Useless to U.S. ALL.
Real life in the 21st century is a parody.
terrible
Lol I find this girls videos so funny
Simply gold!
She is terribly cute, and she seems like a lot of fun.
I just wish you guys could act. Hint: You can't
Just stumbled across the Bee. Thanks for the laughs!!
The website is still up and running.  Everyone who fired or quit was useless.  I never thought I’d delight in seeing this sort of thing happen.  But watching thousands of these little petty tyrants go jobless has been a joy.
😁😆😆😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Loser let's protect Matt Gaetz Jim Jordan Desantis Trump because they like prostitutes and little boys and Trump wanted his daughter this channel went to Trump university
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6k soy boys and girls got mad at this video lmao
Hey, I know Steve from Fruitport, MI!    WHY WOULD YOU BAN HIM?   He's a great guy!   Just likes kitten videos...
This is brilliant!
LOVE the Office Space/The Bobs reference "what ... would you say ... ya did there?"
https://youtu.be/P9h4za9wlI0
It's remarkable how incredibly unfunny this is.
😆😆😆
You mean to tell me she got an interview only 9 days after being fired? Really?
The ending was the best!
I know some folks like this lmao just like her
I can genuinely say that I don't get this video, and that's coming from someone who usually enjoys Babylon Bee satire. The current state of twitter employee is that they're being overworked and treated unfairly, although those are just the ones who weren't fired, unlike the girl in the video. So I guess I just don't understand who thought this video was a good idea.
Certainly one of you best videos ever....
The former Twitter wokeforce, sorry workforce, are in for a shock in the real world...
The Bob Slidel references from Office Space are gold "what is it...ya do there?"
Reminds me of Summer in last night's Yellowstone episode
You people are f_cking HILARIOUS! You should be on T.V. instead of that crappy Saturday Night Live.! Signed: new greatest fan.
You know I always see videos like this but I have a question.... Is there really people like this? Is this just a joke?
The little clap!!!
more cutting edge comedy from the lowlives at the Babylon Bee
So stunning ... and brave.
😂🤣😅😅😂😂😅🤣🤣😂🤣
This is not true. I used to work for Google and trust me it's so much work. They are just using satire to spread false news. It is funny but just get a laugh out of it. It's never okay to be happy at someone else's pain. These folks lost their job in the holidays, have a heart.
😂
This is Too Funny.
This is True.
funny cuzzz its true hahaha
True
OOOfff life gets rough i wonder if this ppl would actually get adapted to the reality somebody should study them for science
That red haired woman in this bit should be in TV show.  Better than most from Saturday night live .  And she has a nice voice
what's 100% funny.  is this isn't funny.  and it's not a parody.   this S is real.
Too good..wow
A freedom fighter in Ukraine!
Hahahahahaha
Sadly, not even parody, more like a reenactment
Hilarious but spot on.
Why do all these jokes feel stolen from office space??
When he said "i'll be back in 5" i expected her to accuse him of attempted black -lll- face.
Journalists making fun of software devs never thought I’d see the day
That girl can be the next vice president and she'll be just as useless as the current one.
She needs to get a government job
Dean Baker, a well known economist, was canceled by Musk for joking about him.  let's not pretend that Elon bought Twitter to promote free speech.  Kathy Griffin and many others are dealing with cancel culture at Twitter.
haha!!!!
With very little change of dialogue, this skit could represent my college students of language and literature. "Dr. Williams, can I still raise my D+ in your course to an A ?" / "Uh... Kateri, it's May." / "Oh, I mean MAY I raise my grade to an A ?"
The ending was fire.
That’s funny because at my my job we have a guy that is very fast but his girly or than this laid off Twitter employee.
I don't put this skit far past what may actually happen increasingly in real life. sorry to say.  But this quip is funny as hell.
😂🤣😂 Well done surprised Mandy did specify “me time” from what I hear it’s big with millennials. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😉😉😉
cant wait for these things to get real hungry & starve to death
note don't hire twitter employees
Welcome to the real world. Censor us now 🤣🤣😂
it's really strange most social media platforms use indian CEO, like google and including recently fired twitter CEO
HAHAHAHA!
I love how the boss and his existing employee celebrate having their job offer declined.
It's a job, not adult daycare.
huh. I was hoping this was a comedy sketch.   Seems like conservatives venting their imaginary frustrations to me.
This is why the left is madd at them.they get more views than most of cnn videos and liberal ppl videos
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is hilarious.
Californians😶
It was hilarious.
The job of surviving the next pandemic?
Are you guys CRAZY? Do you really believe that the competitive, highly specialized people who worked for Twitter before Musk would have anything in common with the girl portrayed in the video??
Is this true about what working at Twitter was like ?
I know we are joking but these lefties are just like this.
Outstanding video and presentation
I work so hard that i dont even have time to eat, those guys deserved it having so much privilege and banning others, discriminating and forcing their culture on others, go find a true job
LOL !!!!!
Before watching this video, I had no idea Babylon Bee had been banned from Twitter. After watching this video, I fully support reinstating that ban.
LMAO. Yep good luck with a real job powder puffs. Were your based on your performance and efficiency, not your Socialistic ideology against Freedom! 🤣
Steve from Michigan!
China wins!
This kind of people are mentally deranged and are dangerous to us all. These are the kind of useful idiots who supported the brutal repression of the state forces in many so called western democracies. They supported the police dragging out the elderly out of their homes in Christmas, they supported mounted police beating women sitting down in sign of peaceful protest. They supported covid concentration camps in New Zealand and Australia. They supported the banks when forbidden the entrance or even freeze the accounts of people. They supported the media terrorism of covid, the mass censorship of dissident voices in all the western countries. They are more dangerous than the crooks, because these people are the ones supporting the crooks.
This Country is toast.
This is funny but never forget these Twitter people silenced the voices of millions around the world - for their political beliefs. So they can fuck off big time.
the thing that sticks me about twitter is that they actually had red wine on tap, i mean how much wine is everyone drinking that they cant even open bottles and why are people even allowed to consume alcohol at work, none of this makes any sense whatsoever.
Who do you think keeps this website running? Conservatives truly live in their own reality
You think that’s crazy? Imagine getting paid to write jokes for Babylon Bee and never having to be funny. 😊
Sad but true. This is accurate with a bit of exaggeration for effect. But not that much exaggeration.
When is the inventor of the tunnel finally going to find a new job?
Up!
Lame. Twitter is falling apart because Elon is having a moment. There is nothing right-on about his acting-out. And the jokes about job expectations were simply not funny. The premise and substance are both fails.
If the democrat Party gets its way the Babylon Bee *would* be banned!
I'm behind the times I guess. What's cornhole?
Props for this young Lady, she's amazing and better than most Actress!
I started part-time work at a factory three weeks ago. If she met the interview lady in person, Mandy would be dead. If she actually showed up to her shift and worked for fifteen minutes, she'd also be dead. Maybe Mandy could learn a thing or two from the tough Asian and Portuguese ladies who work 12 hour shifts.
With a little makeup and the right clothes she can be in the Vegas telephone book.
Geeeeeeeeeeenious! hahahahahaha
Now these ex employees will have to find REAL work.
Why not work at FakeBook? oh that's right they let go 11,000 employee's but most news agencies don't talk about it because they protect the crooked politicians like president Brandon. History books will label Musk as a hero for exposing Brandon and him selling our country out.
WE Love you ELON!!!
Sounds about right.
"cornhole sesh".  Took me a couple seconds, but eventually I got what she meant.  I hope.
I remember when the babylon bee produced witty satire about reformed theology and christian living. Those were the good ol days.
Me: Laughing in welder
🤭
Great Job!!!
I worked a job in a high finance firm and got in trouble twice for not surfing the internet enough and not socializing with the other women enough. Oh, and I “dressed too nice”. So, the others would come in, and turn their computers on. Just…on. Then they would go make coffee and breakfast in the break room. Then they would come back and start the downloads. Then it was time to go for a long mid-morning coffee break…somewhere else. Then they came back and did a little computer work for about a half an hour.  Sometimes almost an hour. Then it was time for lunch, and they took a two hour lunch. Then they came back, and worked for another half hour. Fighting they were in their “afternoon slump“ and had to go out again… Somewhere else… For ice cream. Then they came back, and wrapped up whatever they were doing in 20 or 30 minutes, and went home. I don’t think they ever put in more than two hours of work in their seven hour workday. The job was from 9 to 4. And that was with a paid lunch hour, but it was almost expected to take two hours and not just one.  My previous job often required split-second precision, and no slacking for the most part. It was go, go, go.  So when I was offered a job at a very good salary, I had this crazy notion that the company should get what they paid for out of me. I would finish my work very quickly. I would go around and find other things to do, but then I got in trouble for “doing other people’s job“ when they wanted to do it… Only they were rarely ever actually doing it. They had company meetings every week and would ask if anyone had input on improving efficiency.   You can imagine what I had to say about that…most of which I kept to myself, seeing the futility of it. I didn’t even point out the constant breaks, and the minimal work.   I just noted to them that the filing system of the hardcopies of all their multi-millionaire accounts was abominable, and that in order to be able to answer immediate questions from said clientele, it should at the very least be legible, and preferably color-coded, and properly organized in 1st and 3rd, and 2nd and 4th quarters (set up that way for ease of locating the file of the most current copy in the cabinets, when reconciling hard copies of the past quarter, which could be on anyone’s desk, whilst filing the most recent quarter, very functional as opposed to the needle in a haystack system they had), and end of year files, same reason, and how it might be helpful to not just scribble the names on random folders with whatever writing utensil was handy, but to actually print them out with the name and account number, last name first, and the type of account, like “Smith, John   Irrevocable Trust”, and next line “Quarters 1&3    Acct #157823362”.   Wild, crazy idea. With precious little to do, and bored nearly to tears, and not putting in enough time surfing the Internet, and just completely disinterested in gossiping with the other women, (and yes, I got a couple of lectures for not gossiping, yes, NOT gossiping), and getting on the Internet to fantasize about expensive thing to buy, like boats, and stuff like that.   So, they graciously allowed me to do that. And then finding a file was a breeze, which is helpful when you have a needy, but wealthy client who sorta wants to be a day trader, but doesn’t really have how to do it down very well. You’d be surprised how many wealthy people feel guilty about spending their own money, too, and they almost ask permission to draw from their own accounts. I probably spent more time listening, and I didn’t mind that at all. It was nice to just talk to people and hear their problems out. It wasn’t what I was hired to do, but wasting time was an expectation, and since it probably built client relationships, it is was all OK.  Anyway, I did that, single-handedly. It came out great. It kept me occupied for a time. But while it was ideal for many, it was an awful place to work for me, because I felt I should earn the income I was paid. I did “step outside my work responsibilities” one day as was hard to not do, and answer an incoming call when the receptionist was already tied up on the phone (by “doing her job”, I was “stepping on her toes”), and it was a major national/international financial paper on the phone with an issue to resolve.   In the assisting of that situation over a period of a few days, they kept asking for me after that, and I made all the return followup calls. On the final day of that particular situation, they actually put me on hold momentarily, and came back on the line with a job offer from management to come to work for them, because of how I handled their situation. Apparently at some point in the followup calls, they had got management on to listen in, and it became an unannounced job interview that I didn’t know I was doing… until they offered me the job. I should have taken it. I can’t think now why I didn’t take that job. But it was kind of them to ask. They were and are  a highly respectable company, and would have had great pay and benefits.   Quite a contrast to this vid.
If former Twitter employees are like that, hard time is coming for you all guys.
🫶👌
The last handshake when she gagged reminds me how some girl see 2 handed jobs😂
Hilarious
Now I know who the one was that banned me on 7/2022.
Public School administrator
Honestly, the only fitting work for these ex Twatter employees that I can envision is becoming politicians. Maybe Occasional Cortex is hiring a secretary. 😏😏
woah, no way this is actually what employees were able to do at Twitter...
I bet the stereotype they painted of the fired Twitter employees aren’t too far from the truth.
When the guy peeked around the corner at the end I thought it should have gone something like... Worker: Well was I right? Boss: Yeah it was fun! Worker: Hey I know this guy who got laid off from Facebook. Boss: Just let me work up some some sweat and body odor moving some stuff around and I'll call him up. Worker: Woah, woah slow down! You don't want the guy to pass out from seeing effort do you? Boss: It's alight I'll just spray some WD-40 under my armpits.  ...but that ending was good too :) .
I thought Mandy played an excellent role. I'd like to see more of her playing that kind of libtard role. FUNNY
Mandy should look for a job in telemarketing next.
Is this really a thing? This generation is doomed with people like her the first glance is a red flag to not hire this girl
You know he banned🤣
Kinda like YouTube hiding downvotes/dislikes. Can't hurt anyone's feelings. It might make the likes actually mean something
Elon you did all right! 😁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Woah! What is this cringe?
This video shows how decadent our society has become and how so many jobs in IT are useless.  The hard working men and women in real physical jobs with demands need to be the role model.  We need to get back to the real way of working that got things done.
Plot twist ..... the actress IS  A EX Twitter Employee
Great
That was a twist worthy of M Knight Shyamalan.
How’s they get a job at twitter in the first place if they have no credentials lol I’m confused
1:05 love the Bob Slydell reference!
In my country we call these people "gnocchi" (yes, like the pasta) they also hold political positions as assistants in congress and receive a salary 🙌
Spot on! Haha
Please, make another one
Or....any applicant in CA
Who’s this actress she’s good?
😭going as planned by the masters of SMACK. WEF, 21st c. Rulers... IV Reicht;  Industrialised Banana Republic of America...
And everybody was Bitchin. Look at with the keystone pipeline people went through with Biden and getting rid of them.
If they have Twitter on their resume I wouldn't even interview them.
Kudos to the actress and actor. Well done.
this is so funny, I keep coming back to watch this. Love it!!! 🤣🤣🤣
"What would you say, YA did there?", hahahaha great office space reference
Love it!
Matrix time
What’s insane is a lot of this isn’t parody, even if it seems like it is
Many a true word is spoken in jest!
Lately if they actually put in the effort to get employed they are entitled and refuse to actually do any real ( stuff that requires hand/eye/brain coordination) [didn't want to use the W word or I'd get banned!] Nearly none of the fast food restaurants have enough staff to open the dining area. Help Wanted signs everywhere! Bind-em cured c/v/d with a white house speech two months ago! What is the f-n hold up?! If they don't get a job how are they going to afford all that recently legalized weed!? Oh, wait... They just mooch off the government and cash subsidence checks every month. Bonus money for each kid you squirt out with no baby daddy on the birth certificate! It'll all go to their kids'  *cough* wellbeing I'm sure of it! Then scream how R's banned abortion (lie) while cashing those checks each month.
It's cute how you think "real jobs" haven't all been corrupted by Leftists.
Headline written by a douchebag.  I see we now make sport of bashing Ex Twitter employees
The sink implied he is throwing out everything from twitter but the kitchen sink
Mandy should apply at the DMV or Post Office, where her misguided belief that the government is a wise, efficient, all knowing machine which works for the people, is crushed.
Next Job - Certified Nurses Aide at a nursing home...Bedpans! Human Contact! Caring for others! Comedic Gold!
I bet Elon decided to fired the staff of Twitter within the first day of observation.
"What would you say...you did there?"  Love the little nod to Office Space.
yep but the problem is this people also sit at meta ans many other companies
ITS SO NICE TO SEE BABYLON BEE FINALLY GETTING THE RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE! Keep posting videos that are similar to trending things so you can reach a bigger audience with the algorithm
I love Elon Musk
uber driver
Corn hole sesh lmao
Walmart is Hiring
This is actually too real. This mindset is prevalent all around, not just at Twitter though Twitter is perhaps a kingpin in the laid back fraternity party atmosphere of employment. I have seen people like this woman. One really has to wonder about the future of the USA with lazy, self obsessed people like this applying for jobs. Her level of reality is about that of a 5 year old and that may be an insult to 5 year olds.
Don't feel bad about her. She is going find job in the university as a sociology teacher.
Yes, but where’s the satire?? Confused.
p̳r̳o̳m̳o̳s̳m̳
Good one.
The best😂😂😂
Perfect.
Thousands of ex twitter employees are now entering the workforce for the first time.
Best video
Brilliant. Seems to me that's not just Twitter twits.
and that why you got FIRED! BAMMM
*Biden & the Government continue to create Genocide on the US People!  Let’s Go Brandon!  How about the Thieving Government Stop Spending like Drunken Sailors… cut Government!* *'Don't underestimate Joe's ability to (expletive) things up'* The US Government has pissed off Russia/Putin, Most of the rest of the World, & the US Citizens! *What could go wrong when a Government pisses off its own people?* *The Government Party...

in "job"- whe censored every thing whe dont like in twitter Now Fire- Why censored the free speach, you are the opressor
Mandy should try being a day care worker....
Being sarcastic....but WHO RAISED THESE PEOPLE
"Job...Job?"
It's actually worst then what this video shows. Some of these people that "worked" in Twitter thinks a man or women can become women, man, or anything else just by announcing it. Everyone can have their own pronounce and can be called anything, and the Earth is flat. Just imagine one of them becoming a teacher and teaching your kids this kinds of things. School doesn't screen these kinds of people so this is like a nightmare coming true.
She’d be great at blowing…… up bags
Ah revenge is sweet!
Imagine I'm the interviewer and she says she suspended Babylon Bee and Libs Of Tiktok in twitter! She'll get thrown out forcibly!
I genuinely hope all those lib ex employees end up living in a Box under the free way heroin addicted.
Barista here. Some of us are not woke.
It's what another youtuber called it. Most of these Silicon Valley tech jobs were really adult day-care. XD
So true, I couldnt stop cringing lmao
think this is both twitter and young people
Is that this bitch worked at Twitter and and fired from Elon Musk ?
Twitter = Bird Brains....
Real work must seem scary when you haven't seen it in a while.
The scary thing about this is, it’s not far from the truth.
cornhole is getting a bad reputation here.
She is disgustingly realistic as this was stupid.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is great
Yeah, everybody thinks whatever they do for a living is a "real" job and everyone else's isn't. I'm pretty old. I'm sure none of you EVER worked as hard as I have, especially if you're under 65. No way. I worked 60 hours/week routinely. For decades. Before leaving for work I had to milk the cows, chop firewood...and, often as not, fix the tractor. Then took three trains into the city to work in a manufacturing plant where I paid the company $150/week for the priveledge of having a job  🙂
Welcome back to Twitter!!
The woke snowflakes waited to get paid without working. Kudos to Elon for doing the right thing 👏
lol at what people think twitter work was like.
destroyed !!
Great video! I clicked on it because I thought it was an actual documentary about the people that got fired from twitter.  What I saw was hilarious and sad the same time...!   As a person that is engaged in manual labour I feel deeply offended by this mentality.
yall need to level up
THE HORRORRR!!!
Sooooo true of white liberals 😂😂😂
And he called her MISS??? Lawsuit. U got her Pronouns wrong
Every time i go on whisper i see some zoomer shouting that 15 an hour is garbage pay lol! These kids are in for some hard reality checks.
Anyone else is reminded by the Office Space interview scene?
hahaha ... the real world lol.  liberals cry
Zoomers truly are the lost generation (because millenials raised them).
You guys are the best
Thanks!
Can't they like work with her to adjust to her schedule which I know is very booked? When can she like get her nails done or her hair streaked?  Don't say weekend that is so not cool.
Elon will do to Facebook as Facebook did to Myspace.. so goodbye mark goodbye Tom hello Elon!!!!!!
😂
🤣👍🤣👍🤣👍
I know a teenager who makes a big deal out of her ice cream scooping job and she makes $20 an hour. That’s great pay, but she says her tips are so deserved because she’s using her body for labor. 🙄
Musk needs to swallow his pride and reinstate Alex Jones everyone deserves a voice that's what free speech is
This most of this generation needs sectioning unfortunately, this is what happens when families can’t be a family anymore because or cost and work demand and kids end up in far left educational system, no religion, TikTok and onlyfans degeneracy is all they have, so sad what we’ve done
Quality. :D
See how far that liberal arts degree will take you.
Why would twitter employees apply for a blue collar job? Also, it is disgusting how people in the comments are celebrating tweeps loosing their jobs. I’m hoping these people also lose their jobs in the coming economic recession/depression.
This pendulum can’t swing fast enough. These people are not going to be able to survive in the real world.
This is pretty disingenuous and cringe lol.
Ya know it's weird when elon puts all that stuff on them not working and doing anything that's not productive and politically motivated and yet their backlash is nothing legal or beyond petty sabotage efforts.
Love the office space reference!
Very well done!
An episode of ‘Friends; The Later Years’
LOL!😄😆😆😆
Yea content moderators didn’t get these benefits and if they did it was incidental bc they were in the same building as the engineers.
Lots of incels in the comments.
I don’t like this, Babylon Bee is parody no more. This is real life, not parody.
Perhaps a bit off topic, but I CANNOT STAND (sorry, I got a little emotional there for a second) the sound of Millennial voices, male or female.  Is it just me?
This is exactly why these young people have no idea the value of earning $$$$ Time to get a actual job snowflakes instead of milking the people that actually do contribute to society
she's cute!
Stop it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
…and yes we’ve raised an entire generation of these…….
Concern 4 ELON as he must face the BIG 3 AGA APPLE GOOOOOGLE AMAZON
What kind of cornhole sesh is she referring to?
hate  bullshit  and  this is  bullshit  i bet twitter workers  worked  harder than  most  of  you  i never understand  public  taking   billionaires  side  against real workers  just because  he  can  buy better social media and  make it look like  they were lazy;   how many of  you are  now in the  firing line  ;  when  Elon buys out  your  company
I've never been a fan of Elon Musk and I have pretty much always been critical of him...but...I'm fkn loving this whole Twitter thing haha. I'd say I'm warming up to Musk.
This is how the new generation is today. We should send them for one year to work in AFRICA  and realise how the real world is. .....
The girl is very good very pretty or is that a sexist comment ?
And yes, for the love of God, STOP the fist bumps and Christ help me, the elbow bump. A handshake is part of proper etiquette. The rest is pure dumbassery
Mandy is the epitome of the pathetic candy ass POS imbeciles now running amuck. I'm knocking on 40 and can get the workload of 25 of these dipshits accomplished before lunch. Pathetic. SMDH
Twitter was a nest of discrimination, cancellation and excluding, it is a great thing that so many people were fired. Tweeter staff banned, silenced or harassed people who did not fit far left wing movement for years.
Cute premise...bad timing, acting, editing.
What do you think Elon really thinks of the people commenting in support of this? An asshole is an asshole. Yes, some people need to get a clue about real work. But if you think what is happening is at Twitter is a good thing, you deserve the derision and boot heal Elon and those like him will give you.
So both crimes against the 2 lgbt bars were both committed by people of the lgbt community. How is that Trumps fault?
Priceless
I don't know if it's a good idea to list "Twitter" on your resume. It might just screw the pooch!
People are ignorant that they actually feel bad for Twitter Employees being fired... Don't feel bad for them.
This actress nailed it!!
November 4th 2022 will go down in history as one of the best days because that's the day that WOKE has been shown the door!
ROFL
Anyone else see Lena Paul when they look at this girl?  lol
Is the twit free? Jeez!
Her acting is superb.
That was hilarious!
This is fricken hilarious
Something especially ludicrous about podcasters mocking people with "real jobs".
Lick up to the liberal tree of disgust and see the benefits……
Subtle nod to Office Space the way he said "what would you say... ya did there"
Hahahajaja
These are literally the funniest videos I have ever seen. I couldn't stop shitting myself because of how hard I was laughing. SHRIMP... AT A FACTORY!!! LOL fucking classic. 10 outta 10
Get a life and a real job.  Boo Hoo. Grow up
Brilliant!
Remember to keep your fry station clean.
What a great life the parents and grandparents provided for the Wokesters...by working...
It would be funny if it actually wasnt real.
Ya now Elon is kinda begging for people to come work for him 80hrs per week.
anyone notice the Office Space reference?
Love it how they show the rotten brats the former workers of Twitter are.
Classic! Says so much about the pampered clowns who don’t know what work and responsibility is.
I love these videos! It's Conservative SNL
The scary thing is how true this is
she could show her vagina to illegal immigrants for 40c a peek.
Spot on.
So true
More true than you know.
I love how all these actors and the writers who wrote this also haven’t had a “real” job.  Also most blue collar workers don’t even have difficult jobs, they’re just too dumb to get higher paying jobs
This is so stupid. Elons a fucking nazi. Plenty of jobs around. Elons a pussy.
Just before Christmas.  Elon, you suck.
Mcdonald's Is Hiring.
If this is an example of todays workforce, we are all in serious trouble.
She should apply for: Turd recovery specialist!
So true Useless younger generation
I'd like to thank Elon Musk for introducing me to this hilarious channel (by restoring your account
'We have decided to go in a different direction'🤣
She is the typical California liberal useless shlub
Чистюля... 😏
Very hilarious and funny. These morons losing jobs in Twitter...fantastic! Also they do not deserve a decent job anywhere.  - Love from India
Brilliant, but that ending was 👌👌👌🤣🤣🤣
Steve from Fruitport Michigan 🤣
She looks like Lena Paul, but a wee bit skinnier!
Her job has become easier ... make a joke about Elon Musk, and you're banned. Best way of getting your Twitter account cancelled.
😂😂
This explains the epitome of feminist mindset and why women have become so intitled.
Sounds like someone was salty they got banned on twitter
She should get a job as a coal miner she’ll really fit in😆👍
I absolutely LOVE that the Twatter Punks who "shadow banned" my Freedom Of Speech have now been FIRED!!! Hahahaha!!!
Yes... tech jobs apparently require 0 work. Yall are fuckin retarded.
Lol 😂
They need to do this same skit for YouTube employees
Exaggeration of the truth.
It was kinda odd when Musk went to twitter HQ with a thor hammer, now i know what it means.🤣
Tough shit, time to grow up little children.
I'm ex military and I had my GM ask me if I was already to get my Night Audit stuff done on time. I later had to sit down with PC. Peoples's and Culture. AKA Human Resources. They be explained how it's rude to be sarcastic and condescending to the GM.
I worked at twitter i was fired for being a rare white bird one rarist birds in the world as a diverse world is one full black crows.
Love the pussified woke stance, These are the very bottom of the food chain when the shit hits the fan under this failure administration.
how true !
😂
uhhhh, most of these people have multiple STEM degrees and certifications, are used to pushing 60+ hour weeks and are highly sought after, many even had job offers and recruiters hounding them before they got home from the twitter office. Musk is a billionaire, but hes not evil, hes a dumbass that started to believe his own hype and has enough money to not let it catch up to him until now.
Brilliant.
Can it be made into a series? Adventures of the former Twatter ''employee''?
this is my literal view of twitter staffers , thank god for elon firing these lefty morons
She can always get an HR job somewhere.
This is even funnier if you've seen Office Space.
Trump voter if she's that dumb.
I retired from my civil service job too soon.  When the pandemic hit, my former coworkers were sent home. Now 2 1/2 years later they only recently had to return to the office once a week.  I could have kept that schedule without the stress of dry cleaning, buying lunches, and buying that $500/month train ticket. This is a priceless piece on the wokeism the workplace faces. ,
All the downvotes are gonna be those fired buffoons who got paid exorbitant amounts of money to do literally fuck all, even turn up to the office lol welcome back to reality guys
when i hired people  they bullsh*t there way into  job  and then first working day complained about  the physical work even though they agreed to be able to do all, that was stated during the interview  - there by gaining a few days salary,  at least the girl was truthful,
GO  WOKE  GOOOO BROKEEEEEEE!
Rooftop cornhole sesh? With mimosas? What kind of "manual labor" with grease were they doing there?
why
Can we have Mandy go to Ukraine and join the not so good fight?
All those fungus deserves to be on the streets now
I like how you think mechanics and people that work plant jobs 1.don’t wear gloves and 2.wear their wedding rings when that could be very dangerous
This was great
Anyone else think that Mandy bears a striking resemblance to Lena Paul?
FHRITP!
The Office Space "What would say... you did there." nod was perfect.
I'm still 98% unsure if this is a parody or a real experience
I guarantee you that while this is parody, the actual reality for some of these ex "tweep" layabouts won't be far from it.
I assume this is the new version of boomers shitting on millennials for being lazy when boomers paid for college and a house with a part time job
This was AMAAAZZZZIIIIINNNGGGGG LOL!
who else caught the subtle Office Space homage
Funny but accurate
prostitution
If you have worked at Twatter. Please dont apply at my place
This is a documentary! 🙂
What about pronouns?  Are you sensitive to pronouns?  If you're a trans man or trans woman, will you be treated as you prefer?  will you be esteemed?  what about a promotion?  which restroom do you use?
1:06. So 'Office Space' 🤣
😆😆😆
This actress is so convincing, I’ve grown to dislike her. 😂
I love a man with grease on his hands. Let's go back to MEN doing the real work while women stay home and enjoy the money, shopping and kids.
Very funny! I totally enjoyed this.🤣
I should have worked at twitter instead of wasting my life as a cook
There's this realty...and then me, worried that I'm gonna get fired...
Aren’t most of the people who work at Twitter some type of IT guy or tech bros?
"What would you say... ya did there"   LOL LOVE the Office Space movie reference.   You guys are so cool.
Best part of video is the “COFFEE BRAND COFFEE” commercial
Not to be all gay but the boss is super hot I’d work for him
I'm so glad you're doing these videos. Thanks, and keep up the good work.
Thank you Elon Musk!
Wow, conservative Christian satire is… not very good 😬 but can still garner millions of views.
xD
1:01 wait was that an Office space reference!!! gold
"Would you like fries with your order?"  Somehow I think a lot of birthing persons and sperm doners are going to find that a bunch of  she/hers and he/hims have moved back into their basements
That was friggin funny
They aren't called "the last generation" for nothin! lol
Maybe a roof gutter cleaner would be more suited to her skills.  Clean out those downspouts Mandy!
5.7K Dislikes as of this post on Thanksgiving Day!   -- Must be a hard time for the fired Twitter job seekers and their families. It never is fun being banned from the public forum, either! --  What goes around, comes around!
Fired them all thanks to Elon.
I’m just so happy that we can go back to making fun of each other again.
Please create a Rumble account, Youtube might censor you.
I’m sure many people are like that. Is this a created narrative about Twitter? Is there clear proof that only pus woke people worked for Twitter? Weird this is an enjoyable video for many that chime in with their worthless sarcasm. There’s probably a name for people that like these made up narrative threads. professional sarcastic mentally disturbed hater?
ROFL
🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣Brilliant
stupid AF
Not only does she come in 20 minutes late, she comes in through the side door so Lumbergh doesn't see her.
GREAT work ! :D
Exactly as I imaginated :) this video was fun and sad too. Because it is fun and reality too.
Ok I know this is parody but I was legit getting annoyed watching this. To accurate I hate my generation.
Well the rent in the bay area should decrease a bit for now
worthless gen
There's a yoga mat joke in there somewhere...
Way to dodge that bullet. Oops  I meant lead thingy from a pew pew thingy
yo, at first I thought its another movie with Lena Paul xD
... More entitled: Who you think you are   ? I will get you canceled if you speak about duty again.   I  W A S WORKING FOR TWITTER
My friends daughter is one of those they/them's and this is exactly the way she is😆
The Babylon Bee a satire joke site for the religious right, that Elon loves.  Elon is scrambling to get his employees back.  Why Elon and his worshippers think that Twitter runs itself is beyond me.  Now certain people think they know the inner workings of Twitter.
So this video is just something someone made up to reinforce their own uninformed opinion about what people who work in tech do? Pretty much just masturbation
Damn, the roast.
Maybe Solid Waste might have position on the back of a garbage truck for her
Rooftop Cornhole sesh: 100% accurate
Has twitter stay out of woke culture. They probably still working for twitter.
but in real life those educated people that know how to work IT have no problem getting good jobs
LOLOL 😋👌🏻👍🏻
People like this are allowed to vote
Cool
That doesn't make Musk a non-idiot at  any stretch of the imagination. Hahaha...
Its funny that they think this is funny.
this isn't funny
Am I the only one who suspects that the employees of twitter, yelp, yahoo, google, and facebook are doing a job that could be done by nobody?
Ex Twitter employees are not looking for “work.” They are looking for jobs. Preferably jobs that don’t involve actual work.
I expected her to be offended by blackhands there in the end, but ok.
cock sucking freeloaders
😂😂so damn true 😩😩😩😎Rickster 🤘
Most of you people are fucking morons. Musk is begging for his workers back. Twitter is literally tanking and you morons are pretending  these people didn’t work. I swear some people ( mostly republicans) are stupid af. Literally dumb af and have no clue how things work
as a factory worker, this is halarious. After I watched that "A day in the life of a twitter employee" video I knew just how out of touch with reality these people are. They don't even know what hard work is!
Looks like people who all worked on twitter are really spoiled
women are given the easy jobs in factories and get the same pay as the men doing the back breaking jobs.  and that's so institutionalized the managers don't even get sex for doing it
Those jobs sucks
I love how people we're saying Elon will regret letting all these people go.  Its like jeez how is he going to find people who will be able to fill the 4 hours a day these people use to "work"
If any companies hired them you dam right they are all CORRUPT! IF YOU ALL SEE ANYO GET HIRED IN YOUR COMPANIES THEY WATCH YOUR BACK! ALSO WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT DORCY! THEY NEED TO GET HIM AND SEND HIS F ING TO JAIL !
Woke bastards
Even prostitution might be too much for that cunt
A proper representation of the attitudes of most twitter employees, how they had jobs heaven knows.
I would not be surprised he moves Twitter to china  I'm so tired of the west lying about asian people  My son in school. In the Philippines they go for 12 hour days to school  America most Americans can not read or write or do math . Go to hospital 🏥 asian Indian doctors Philippino nurses so go to the laybor force Espanic  high technology jobs skill labor Asian  Americans are falling to the waist side  That's the truth bouse of our education  We used to teach our kids in school shop home economics how to cook sow and other skills now we teach them feelings weak shit. So this is what we get.  America won't last Elon musk no,s it he needs a work force that will work  he has tesla factory in china 🇨🇳 proply move everything over their
When useless Twitter employees face reality...and they realise...i can't do anything.🤣
Thats Mia Rose Frampton.
I was a recruitment consultant. I started out doing 1-day temps on bin duty, I ended up hiring to the board of directors of massive firms like Microsoft, BMW, Canon etc. And seriously, this depiction of middle-and-wanna-be managers to terrifyingly accurate. They really, really have no idea what work is, and they get away with it all day every day. The ground units work. Hard. The Boardroom guys play lots, BUT tend to be under massive pressure to deliver "The Project". Middle managers are a total waste of everyones effort. And yes, I'll say it... "The kids these days....." seriously, the young'un's coming through the doors are a joke. "Snowflake" doesn't start to describe these pathetic excuses for applicants. Basically if it isn't a managerial job at Daddies firm they have no idea what to do, and expect a "participation Medal" for showing up late to the interview. Which is good news for our aging populace - I'd hire 1 65 year old over 10 21 year olds any day of the week. I used to work for Canon, and the benfits were astounding. Seriously crazy. I mean to the point that once you're out of it you're thinking "They really should stop that" cos .... its a job, not a social club. I've had 20 year olds turn up to interviews in a sideways cap chewing on a bucket of chicken. Seriously. Girls in tears because their shift hits 8pm on a Friday and they don't get "extra time" to dress before leaving for the club.... Smokers insisting "smoking breaks" are a Human Right...... Give me a 60 year old any day of the week, and I'll get them a job. If you're under 30 - hell under 40 then I look at you with derision and little patience. And if you're 20..... you best be BLOODY impressive, because I can't put up with your "I need an extra afternoon off for mind-wellness" shite.
This video perfectly explains the fucking idiots of today. God i hate people so much
I’ve been in IT for 20 years. This is horrifyingly accurate, and girls like her continue to be promoted throughout the industry.
Explains why Twitter is still making losses. Elon is great for twitter.
“How did the grease get there?” “Coz he works/uh does stuff/uh engages in manual labour”😂😂😂😂
Has the World come to this? We're doomed.

Now when a liberal says corn hole, that usually has a lot different conditions.
Manual  don't you mean person-ual
I enjoyed that immensely! I ❤️ Babylon Bee.
We fired a guy, he asked why we didn't give him a two week notice.
This is brilliant 🤣
Can’t what I want to in the Q. IKR, shocking!
I like babalon bee, but this is b.s.   I work in IT.  It's long hours and often tedious.  Often I work late at night and then have to be back at work early in the morning in case any changes screwed up anything that impact the business.  BB is playing identity politics, while accusing others of playing identity politics.
Lmao this was so funny well done 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mandy is a fool for interviewing at a mechanic shop in the first place lol.
I’m so glad that you make fun of people losing their jobs. It really demonstrates profound empathy. I have a suggestion for a sequel: There was a former President that really struggled when he lost his job too.
I don't even know what a mimosas is, , , but I'll have one.
I wish my work had a rooftop that would support a rooftop cornhole sesh.
😙☕
Entitled niggas worked there
Really nothing to add, but thanks for the incredible laugh! 🙃
LOL 😂😂
Content moderation specialist Wonder how many of those were the first Twatter kooks to be let go. Go Elon!!!  Make Twitter 10x better than what Jack and his minions lied and tried to do!
10am coffee.  Turn on terminal.  Stretch for half an hour.  Chat to colleague for an hour.  Lunch (2 hours).  Spend 5 mins removing anyone Conservative from Twitter.  Go home (Forgot approx 20 coffees throughout the day)
This is fucking hilarious in light of how fast Melon Muskrat backtracked this and needed all those """useless""" employees back. Nice attempt at satire, but all you created was a monument to your own stupidity. Funny though.
Driving a kitchen grease recovery truck.
Hahahahahaha!
Hahahahahaha!
She is HOT AF
I'm not working at Twitter but It's quite cringe to see boomers and other doomers to go after Twitter employees. If it's so easy to work there, why didn't you work there? ah yea, y'all are too dumb to get a job like that. It's easy to make fun of people who do better than you, but it hella difficult to land such job; these companies are looking for the brightest minds and in return provide good perks.
I bet she was making like $435k/yr
I typically like this channel, but it's kind of funny seeing people who don't work in tech trying to illustrate what it's like to work in tech. They clearly don't have an idea what it's like
This is bullshit! I've been a Software Engineer for 40 years. We work long hours and when idiots, who don't know SHIT about computers, break things, we don't go to bed until it is fixed. It has always been that way. Idiots who hate computers and/or robots should 'GET THE F*** OVER IT!' They are here and they are NOT going away, lest we have an an EMP (look it up idiots!), which would only be a temporary set back. If you think writing software is so god damn easy, why don't you just give it a shot. Seriously! Sit down at a computer and write a working application (NOT "Hello World") for Android AND IPhone, get it deployed (if you're lucky enough) and then listen to all the other idiots, who couldn't read your mind or open the help files, give you 1/2 star and destroy your wonderful business. When I started in this business, the first thing anybody ever said to me was "Great! You get paid tons of money to sit around and watch TV!" Yes, they actually said that and they were serious. They thought that software development was basically just 'WATCHING TV!". I respect the blue collar workers, just don't give me shit because I don't lift 200 lbs  50 times a day for $10/hour. Remember us software developers (like you always do), when your computer-based shit breaks because you can't RTFM (look it up).
Sad part is these former employees will still be making 5 times more than most of us make
meh
decent concept, but TERRIBLE acting and execution. :(
AHAHAHAAHAH  this time he was my favourite actor
What's her @ Handle? <3
Yeah! Fruitport, Michigan baby!!!
HELLLO TWITTER  EMPLOYEES  GOT  FIRED   MCDONALD  IS HIRING    HELLLOOOOOOOOO SPOLED BRATS
bahahahahaahahahahahahahahahaha
I agree with everything except the AA bashing. Been sober for 11 1/2 years and God is the center of it
Lol never watched BB before but totally like subscribed and stuff.  Totally like me new thing to do all day as I do stuff from home.
Funny but complete bs. The software engineers will be rehired within a week at their 200-500k salaries in a snap.
“So what would you say… you did there” -office space haha
twitter employee who quit are getting roasted for being so stuck up..We need more of this

Funny funny funny.  Thanks!!!!
Okay, after days and days of searching I have crossed oceans of words (including many pronouns) and I think I have found my home channel. Yeeeaah!!
This a sequel of «A millennial job interview»
Well, answering to the question of: What job should Mandy seek out next?  since yt weren't able to add my response, so my answer is: any job in a 3rd world country, and I hope she likes to be 'stoned' ..
well...
😂🤣😂🤣
Funny but actually true.  A lot them are in for a shock.
Twitter being purged of the lunatics is hilarious.
I am still not sure why you need 7500 employees to run a software on a server? I see owner/investors, ceo, ceo assistant, IT employees to keep servers running, 1 hr employee, 1 payroll, 1 accounts/receivable, and a few moderators constantly banning people and silencing others. I can think maybe 25 total and that is pushing it! - what exactly did the other 7475 employees did? I have worked in production plants with less than 100 people that make heavy duty machinery.... the numbers don't add up. Unless everyone had assistants and the assistants had 2 helpers each....
hope the liberal idiot never finds another job
reason to attack AA?
LOL people like her getting triggered by triggering triggers
How mean is that upsetting the delicate "feelings" of this snow flake..?
Love Elon
Wait until they force you to hire them...and by "they" I mean this personality type.
"Just give me my check and stop harassing me with this "work" thing."
This is fake.  She didn' t say "like" six times in each sentence.
Conservative comedy is pretty lame nowadays
Americanoids actually think that Twitter was acting out of ideology instead of just what markets dictate?  How fucking stupid are you? You nation of subhuman vermin will collapse upon itself and I will be there to laugh down at you, and then when you are at your downest, we will purge your taint from this world.
Conservative humor is so contrived, and honestly kind of sad 🤣
Ok...I'm apparently out of the loop, cornhole session? Ugh that was not talked about in the south in polite conversation 🙄
She’s a strong, independent woman - she don’t need no job
A politician is her next job.
US president.
Its all fun for them now that they we're fired from Twitter. Give it a few weeks when they're hungry and cant pay the bills...they'll be begging for their jobs back!
As funny as this is, it's actually more accurate than people realize.
I always seek jobs that aren’t extremely demanding.
I mean apart from the fact that as high level programmers a large number of them already have a new job, and the reason for all that was to encourage staff to remain at work and put in extra hours, but hey I have a idea if you think them so lazzy and what Musk wants so normal. HEre is your new weekly schedule it's a 7 day week 13 hours a day. After allt he needed stuff such as you know cooking, getting to work (You all hate workjing from home right) and sleep you have roughly one hour free time a day. Oh yeah and despite the hours per week doubling your not getting any extra pay...  Until you are willing to work those and have done so for about a month all of you are lazy in Musks eyes and to be fired.
The funny thing is that I discovered Babylon bee "thanks" to their ban on twitter and how it was reported. Now I am a subscriber. LOL
I find this post far too factual for Babylon!!!
Wait, I always thought Babylon Bee was a parody channel? When did they switch to reporting the truth??
LOL 😂 these “Woke” fools seem to be everywhere. They need to find work in a Communist country where they belong. Remember lol communism is sold under the guise of “community and togetherness”
Nice Apple
Forget Twitter these are the politicians on both sides
Not sure why she's applying.  She's set for a great lawsuit.    Well, I guess once Twitter is bankrupt it won't matter. Musk is violating *sooooo* many laws.   And not just employment laws.  Both the FTC and the EU are already raising issues and the security chief quit *immediately* when they saw what Musk was doing as it has genuine legal and financial risk for them.
Sooooo Cornholeing someone would imply those 2 were gay , not sure how she would do it to someone.
So this is why they call them Butthurt Bee 😂
That about sums up Gen Z in a nutshell.
The truly sad part of this satire is that it really happens. We wouldn’t call it “work” if it were easy..that would be called “play”. Wake Up
its funny how ppl on the internet crap on ppl that actually right code and create the internet as we know it and label them as ppl that dont do real work, but without them not doing (real work) the world as we know it wouldnt exists and all our lifes would entail alot more labor intense work.
Elon Musk is lucky he will never have to get a job.
Excellent!
Lmao.. ok that was pretty good
When you see this video and you live near Fruitport, MI
Try computer programming.
you mean "wokeforce"
I know this is a skit but people actually do talk like this LOL!
Basically, a mentally ill trump cult member filmed this idiotic short film of there fantasy of how there fake outrage about nonexistent problems become real in their minds. Whoever filmed this needs to be bitch slapped to the ground repeatedly. Give me the address and I will come do it for you. You mentally ill trump cult members must continue to be committed, put down, deported to Russia where you belong or maybe be saved by having me bitch slap the stupid out of you.
You know this is happening along with lawsuits for mental distress.
😂
Women are going to start rejecting jobs like they reject men 🤣🤣. This is going to be fun to watch.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thank God for Elon!
I live in Fruitport Michigan.   Steve is happy to have his Twitter account back.
Next.
Did you guys add 'parody' on your account? Otherwise your billionaire oligarch overlord will ban you from your "freeze peach" platform.
Babylon bee you tube actors thinking they know what a day of work looks like… putting fake grease on dandy little actor hands 😂  And failing to see the hypocrisy
I just clicked on "don't recommend channel." Keep ya politics to the other side of youtube. I came here for entertainment.
Elon for POTUS. A real billionaire and genius unlike the last one
That that’s what I call a slice of comedy gold 🫡
Well done.  Goal- At least one laugh a day.  Fulfilled, maybe for the week.   The acting was appropos.  Worth several thumbs up.
lol I love it
Love this very accurate picture of the mentally defective mindset of indoctrinated Marxists leftist libturd dipshits we as a society have produced
Bitch was too ugly for even OnlyFans.
Millenials and Gen Z are by and large America's most WORTHLESS Generations.
At first the pathetic liberals were trying to make fun of this now they realize how stupid they are
This is a “Hall of Fame” comment section……….I salute all of you.😂
Feeble attempt at humor and even worse acting..
That day she decided to start onlyfans. 🧐
Our Country is in so much trouble! I somewhat find this funny, but then realize how true it is. The last Machinist's I hired for my business were complete puss ie s. Saw the sign, shut the business down. Good luck all!
These "techies" get paid a minimum of 135k" and live the life. Sometimes they work two tech jobs at the same time and put in a total of 20 hours per week total "work time"
This is awesome now if we can just get streamers to get real jobs.
hope the babylon bee poples who made this had their lay off turn and see who is laugh last
Sexy when she says cornhole just saying.
So Elon Musk payed 43 billion dollars for people who didn't work? Apparently these people did something useful to generate so much value.
Hahahah
I'm surprised she didn't accuse the guy with grease on his hands of blackface.
It's not even comedy anymore it's reality.
Fake tech companies workers will now see the real realities of the world, they lived enough virtual realities.
It really is wild how bad conservative comedy is.
You must get Allie Beth Stuckey to do this, she was hysterical doing her take on a Harvard grad job seeker
um, like, it's a no-brainer to, you know, subscribe to the Babylon Bee
Good.. Get them back to reality
I think this is pretty funny. The sad part is that rednecks actually think this is reality. Liberal California and New York represent 25% of the US GDP, yet have only 15% of the population.
Loved the ending lol
It's a funny video...but it's also a bit sour grapes. This isn't how it actually works at these companies.
None of you know what a Twitter job is like. And Lon is the biggest Twitter (whack)job.
She could fit anywhere in the BCA (Brandon's Clown Administration)
I don't recognise this as anything like any of the employees I knew at Twitter, just a complete misrepresentation. Nice idea for entertainment though.
Don't know man, never had the luck to get such a job, worked for the GCP platform as a support engineer, man I had days where I would easily spend 4 5 6 extra hours to solve complex issue, at my now job I do have indeed the freedom of not having a schedule, but still the work mostly requires at least 30 40 hours a week, and I'm somewhere around mid level as an engineer for the main technologies I use, so I spend my time wisely but it still takes a lot, I can't really believe Twitter was such a gathering of lazy woke people that worked on probably 2x 3x my wage.
Wth?!😆damn snowflakes are screwed
Snowflake tears 😛
spoiled rotten hipsters
You are literally to stupid to know what real work and real comedy is
I keep saying we have some of the dumbest people in this woke crap who think life is peaches and ice cream and there going find out here in America is land of the hard workers and not lazy asses .
Stuff..Work..😅
I'm sure these 7,500 fired employees will not be figured into Biden's next jobs report.
Nanny
These twitter employees still made 5x what y’all do sooooo
imagine being american
Love this clip. She's so funny
This is one of the woke pos trash that censored you.  I hope people remember her and fuck her up.  The courts won't let people get justice, the trash deserve what they get.
FUNNY STUFF !!!!!!....THESE PEOPLE ARE IN FOR A RUDE AWAKENING !!!!!!
I love it.  A spoiled, rich, white privileged POS borrowed $44,000,000,000 to buy a company that has never made money, immediately fired half the work force and announces bankruptcy is definitely on the table, then tanks the stock of the company he leveraged to borrow the $44,000,000,000 from and it is the engineers and tech-savvy people Twitter is going underwater without who are the actual idiots.  Must be an interesting world view inside that mirrored bubble on yer head genius.  Jezus.
lol love it
Who the heck are you to prejudge that lord musk somehow is righteous to lay people off and claim first real job.  Have to worship someone apparently. Musk this time.  How about musks failure. Losing 100 BILLION dollars starts adding up to real money even for Elon
Low key sounded like WeWork
It'd be hilarious to see these lefties on their first day at a real job. I'm betting it would be funnier than anything Hollywood has put out the last 20 years
Just watching her satire stressed me out because it's probably spot on reality for a large portion of those people that got the axe from twitter.
Isn't this just that character from Brooklyn 99
You guys are crazy. Actually celebrating a billionaire spending 44 billion so that he could fire 5,000 people. He destroyed a company that was making over 100,000,000 a year in profit. That's not good for the economy you fucking creeps.
@ps 403547   Yeah some work maybe not be physically intensive. Yes, maybe there was more backup person to run things smoothly extra extra backup but not everyone useless. Some people is jealous about tech workers getting paid a lot but it is intensive. Someday you work 11 hr just to get things done and yes someday actually 5hrs of work is enough but then you spend rest of the day preparing and organizing for next thing or spend some time to improve something.   Yes you can still run windows 7 and MS word 2010 to do most of your daily email office document needs done just  fine.   The same way they build the and app like twitter it is an computer program and it will run ok and keep running if you don’t touch it an user decreases then it’s fine. Not extra load no worries.   Try to complete with the market for a long run. Develop innovative and new ways to do work or communicate. Then you will see what it takes. Yes Elon musk know a lot. He built Tesla, spaceX etc .   Probably he know what he is doing . Yes may be he could lay off massively but the way it’s done was humiliating.  And he encourage people like ” @ps 403547 “ to call tech workers has same skills as barista or gas station workers.   To be Honest I think it requires lot of work and knowledge and practice to become is barista and a good gas station worker. #respect people. Humiliating another human being is an act of devil.
Well done musk sacking all the far left trolls
Im starting to think these Twitter folks arent as dumb as we thought. They could do anything they wanted or nothing at all and get paid 6 figures for it.
dude she must be the girl from bring it ons sister lol eliza dushku
🤣🤣🤣
she reminds me of the chick from bring it on... eliza dushku
Yeah...Twitter is a real job. Some of the smartest people I know work(ed) there.  I guarantee the people mocking their workforce have not actually worked there. The people making this video are just a bunch of ignorant morons mocking people that they don't know in order to make themselves feel superior.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Does anyone have a video that proves Elon the fraud, stringing together a coherent sentence!? " You can tell it's real because it looks so fake"  This ass hat convinced the gullible, that he sent a Tesla to your imaginary Space. Hope for humanity has never been so low. Spacex & Blue Origin are both American Government owned & the Heliocentric claims, are still only a Theory, go figure.
hating on woman, thats internet for you!!
New Pronouns : Gone & Forgotten 😉
hahahaha
Laid off Twitter employees do not need to interview for a job. The Biden administration will come up with a way to give them unemployment benefits for ever as a way to say thanks for all their partisan help.
Pretty insensitive to mock Content Moderation like that. Those people were required to watch child-porn and torture everyday, and only got paid like $20/hr to do it. They'd literally get PTSD from the work. I wouldn't take that job.
Working for Musk makes you rich.  Only a moron would let themselves get fired.
She could easily be a brexiteer in UK '' '' '"Dum and lazy' '' 'seriously ill educated cave person' ''
Democrat’s are Pedophiles
That's funny stuff.
the worst thing here... that it feels more like a real documentary than a satyre mocking twitter 1.0 lol
Well all those twitter employee's that got laid off wont buy a Tesla anytime soon 😁👍
In reality, probably has a couple masters and finished close to top of class.
Twitter employees are now heading to youtube! They deserve be fired, they treated ME, like fool. They banned ME.
This is horseshit.
Ex Twitter employees need to fill out a hurt feelings report.  Welcome to the real world! Absolutely No sympathy for any of Em'!
Bahahaha!
She should be a snow removal specialist so she can rid us of snowflakes.
Suggest she not mention her employ @ Twitter as potential employers will be stereotyping those as entitled lazy with fragile personalities. I would not consider one layer off from Twitter as a viable employee. If I did hire then definitely 6 months probation would be a caveat.
It's funny cause it's true
Music?
Unfunny and obnoxious. Oh it's the whole "entitled millennials don't want to work hard hurhurhur" from the laziest assholes out there. Wonder if BB got a PPP "loan"
Hilarious ~ great acting!😂
Sounds about right :)
Yeah and wait till the coders and network design and support staff walk out and find other jobs that pay more money.  Then Twitter will be down the !@itter.
Thank you, I needed that :-)
This is on point 👏👏👏
I’ve never met a Twitter employee but I instinctively know that I despise them
Wow by this case the `them’ doing better than the twitteryeet because that `guy’ pull in 3+ hour working before seeking stupidity attention🤣fun sketch guys👌🏻
It's not even really a joke lol They literally played cornhole and drank wine during work hours.
Classic
Hahahahahaa, I love this. This is so funny XD
The funniest part of this... A Youtube content creator calling out someone else about getting a real job.. That's hilarious.
Twitter employee. The most useless employee you can hire ahah!.
They done fcked up now
This is hilarious! XD
It is funny to see actors making fun of tech engineers for not having "real jobs" :)
She's hot, though.
also let her know you dont play ukulele or ping pong all day long in the office 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How does it feel in Elon's a$$h*le Babylon Bee?
Hire them and see how fast they try to start trouble.
hahahhahahhahah 😆😆😆
Jeeze you sad fucks probably never had a decent job in  IT - amirite  ? A lot of these twitter folks will find a job with no issues you losers .
damn this is god awful. no twitter ex-employee is going to work at this type of business lol
To be honest, i wouldn't shake that hand either.
So why is Elon begging workers to come back ?
Elon is like Ironman but bringing the sink.  the snap of a finger and they all start coming back. 🤣
Lmaoooo this is hilarious
Love to hear about all them gone...Elon Musk, please buy Meta, Alphabet...
I thought people at tech work long hours. Where did this narrative that Twitter employees are lazy come from?
They were fired for good reason.
She should apply at Truth Social. Just sayin...😂😂🤣🤣
I know this was supposed to be satirical, but I’m guessing it’s probably close to the truth.
Awesome!
Perfect!  Whoever this lady is, she needs to do movies.  Better acting than I see from many in the movie industry.
in a nutshell
Whoever says twitter is falling apart is a moron lol. I'm so glad a ton of these useless generic npc's got fired haha.
Something tells me that these employees have been goldbricking
babylon bee just salty they never got an invite to the afternoon corn hole sesh
There's a large area in the middle of the spectrum that could be considered "sensible", but we has humans always shoot straight from one extreme to another in our attempt to fix problems.  There will undoubtedly be a great correction at some point (when there's not enough social cushioning to allow nonsense), and then we'll have a few nice years in the middle of eventually reverting to 8 year old kids working fifteen hour days in a field.  If humans manage to stay around long enough, at some point after that there will be a few nice years on the way back to 30 year old adults crying because their company asked them to work through a lunch break one day when three coworkers didn't show up.
Ol girl got cornholed.
SpaceX is recruiting.
They had nothing to do anyways, time to get a real job lol
Good job Elon. You got rid of the deadwood.
The future of what will be a FAILED America....  Its coming soon
Yeah, whoever is writing your scripts and hiring your actors needs to be “relocated.”  This could’ve gone so much further.  And that’s coming from a libturd.
....HOW BLOODY MARVELOUS!!!
Demonizing the staff is a new low point for Elon Musk’s reputation.
Elon paid 44 B for this company?
I got myself suspended on Twitter before Elon took over. Now, I just appeal once in a while and tell them they're fired and to go get a real job. I love it.
Punch her in the gut, throw her out the door.
This is bullshit. Why am I getting this spam into my feeds?
All twitter employees should be poor for the rest of theor lives, as punishment for fuc-king up the world
💯💯💯💯💯
Loving the ‘Office Space’ reference. “What would ya say ya do..”
I wish people were kinder and more understanding
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That was funny!
but they don't see it
Young baby’s enjoy a lifetime of misery while I polish my new vette
It’s funny because it’s probably fairly accurate. Worst part is these morons will soon be collecting taxpayer unemployment benefits.
sorry, but not funny
25 seconds in and I'm violently reminded at how incapable of humor and satire the Right is. Jesus Christ.
That's my youngest daughter to a T.
This is hillarious!  Now off to my job I'm fully underqualified for.
I liked the subtle nod to Office Space that you put in there.
seems accurate
This video specifically made me subscribe, a well done parody
Oh my.. i work 45~50 hr hellish workweeks for an international tech and consultancy company earning about $400 a month. But I live in SE Asia :( are the comments true about our western counterparts?
This looks like a skit Greg Gutfield would do on his program - pure satire, but with truth.
Not too far off, actually.
She's so cute to be fired from a software company.
I didn’t see the in-house Barista station ? What an absolute Hell Hole 😂
Trigger words hahaha
This feels like it was funded by Elon Musk, trying to paint all the people he fired as snowflakes who didn't do any work. Let's see what comes of twitter 2.0.
Mandy were not a good fit
Hilarious
glad i am retired
I believe she makes the actual ex twitter employees look too good...they are probably far more useless.....
Funny, people who carry things around and nail them together trying bring down people who know 3 different programming languages and create the social media you use to “own the libs”.
Shouldn't be such a soulless little cant .
This is probably close to the truth 😀
GO ELON GO     KICK ASS
Bring your own guru
It would be funnier if it was funny.
The sad part is this probably spot on and not a dramatization.
I have been searching for this island. And now I have found it! I have came ashore to the mother land!
Who invites a content moderator to a factory interview?
Imagine being so intimidated by people w/ STEM jobs that you need to invent fantasies like “ComPuTer PeOPle JuST PuSH butTOn Lol!” to heal your bruised ego.
mm dats good satire
Savage
".....during my afternoon corn hole sesh" ? HAHAH OMFG HAHAHAHA
right wing stupidity - the babylon bee sucks
This is for sure like totally not cool.   Will you be making fun of Google collaborators next? Are you guys Russian?
Oh my imagine being butthurt because highly qualified engineers earn more than you, and will easily find other work.
What's the point of this and who cares? Why is it in my feed? Why does anyone think this is funny?
Sack the bastards
pro tip: announce it's racist that black actors never get hired playing characters who are stupid.
What’s hilarious is how Twitter fires about 3,500 employees it’s all the news and it isn’t fair and in-considerate, but Amazon fires 10k and it’s fine, they aren’t being criticized by it from the lame stream media. Why is that?
BB Pro establishment humour is pathetic Punching down.
This was actually the least funny attempt at comedy I've seen in a long while. The acting was fine, but the whole premise just falls flat.
That's.... my future wife right there.
Another reason why I left Twitter and I dont miss it.
Entitled pricks
Those tweeps make satire turn into a documentary. It's like watching Idiocracy all over again.
Oh this is a sketch....  If you can't find one the invent one ....
I felt really sorry for the people who lost their jobs, I have zero empathy now....
A big Haha!!!! This is hilarious!
Elon is going to prove that Twitter could have made so much more money by cutting the bloat.
He really did throw everything out but the kitchen sink
this is sooo true
I thought this was supposed to be satirical?
I can’t stop laughing
LMAO Exactly
Home Depot is hiring cashiers
Good times create WEAK people.
Do people think thats what they did on twitter?   Lol they had normal start times like everyone and worked 8 hours infront a computer banning hundreds of people a day and 30 min lunch break

so who did she cancel The moment she got to work ?her first meeting must of been with  H R.
Hahahaha, get a job you lazy freaks.
Thanks for stoking the culture wars with more stereotypes.  Really helpful, really good for society.
They HAD Real Jobs. It is called They WORKED at Twitter. That was ACTUAL WORK. So Stop spreading False Information and saying Working at Twitter is not a Real Job.
Subscribed! This was actually funny! congrats to the actress totally believable! WAIT! It was an actress right? Right?
she could "learn to code" . . . . ?
What the hell is a cornhole session I know what it means on pornhub  but..........................what does it mean here?
.....and they also had ' Stay Woke ' T-Shirts ...... Elon found them
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Diversity & Inclusion Officer in all corporate offices. At least she would help promote women into leadership.
The dark tone intro had me in stitches 🤣
Is this supposed to be comedy?
I wanna throw up!!!
This is gold! Those idiots should have recognized the opportunity rather than fear the change. Most of them will not secure a job of equal value and will struggle at any job they do get because of that.
Probably the biggest fightback against the "wokerati" and also most significant we are likely to see. Elon, 98% of the West send you plaudits and good luck with your journey
Ouch!
this is awesome, i always said that comparing to us in Iran, IT pros or Programmers doesn't do shi.....t
That's one hard working actress right there she worked her ass off to portray what a useless person looks like.
Mandy needs to be a truck driver. Gone weeks at a time, 14 hour days, shower at truck stops if you are lucky enough to find a parking spot, don't forget shower shoes you don't know what is on that floor, or possibly go 3 days with only baby wipes, sleep in your truck naked and have to shit that lovely fast food all of a sudden? Pull out the trash can, take your explosive shit, then get dressed and go find a trash can to throw it away and try to go back to sleep after walking through snow cause you have 700 miles to drive 3 hours from now. Oh you have a migraine? That 700 miles isn't going to drive itself and the receiver has strict appointment times, if late it could be 4 days before they can get you unloaded and surely you don't want to sit in a truck for 4 days not making money away from home. Government wants to fine you for everything, that you will be responsible to pay, not any company. Very strict drug and alcohol policy, you will get random ua's and hair tests so you cant enjoy a doobie in the colorado mountains on vacation all though it doesn't effect your job at all. Everyone every where hates you and your slow truck and sometimes drivers get shot for simply doing their job driving down the interstate. Shall I continue? Does this by chance sound appealing mandy?
Sadly, this is true of so many of her generation. If they don't start at the top of the ladder, they want nothing to do with it. What happened?
Sorry man. I’ll take a programmer over a bunch of guys that sit around like the women on the view and “talk”
People like that working at twitter was the least of the publics’ concern, better the devil we know to be honest.
Elons dick must be super tasty, there must be a reason babylon bee is dick riding him so hard. did he promise you a pony too?   while their job is literally "do funi video on internet" aka. not a real job according to them. was really creative, you where able to line up so many jokes from 2015 in such a short video. like you guys try really hard to proof that you have more then 3 jokes by lining them up to create a fourth. sadly it did not work tho 😢  while the real comedy is elon begging engineers not to leave the company because he is realizing that he knows shit lmao.
Love to see more such interviews 😍
It's hilarious. These fuckers are going to be workplace pariahs. Nobody will touch them with a bargepole.
What to say to an ex-twitter employee: "Venti late caramel mocha, please"
accurate
This is gold!
Many a true word said in jest,
Office Space: "What would you say... y'doo here?"
Would've been more believable if every person banned was Republican, or white male lol
Elom Musk is a king
1:10  lol i didn't think it was a real job
This was so great, amazing work by the actors. "what would you say, you did there..." my fav bit. Omage to office space ftw :)
What does a "Technoking" do, though?
The shocking part is that it’s actually pretty accurate 😅
No lattes?!
No wonder Twitter was bleeding money!
Wait is that satire, or was an actual interview for an ex Twitter?
She´s a natural :-)))))
Kinda looks like Piper Perri
Niezłe :)
LMAO 🤣 sad part is this is from what people are saying is actually happening except it's actually worse! Some Twitter employees actually quit when they were told that there wasn't going to be a wine fountain at the lunch room anymore!
I love conservative humor. It’s so dry and out of touch. Just like dem libs, amirite, hi five! ✋
I LOVE IT
The funniest part of all of this is that suddenly having boundaries between work and your private life is seen as being lazy by many of the people at the comments.
What u did " time pass "
Musk is just a Mason puppet how can you not see that
🤣🤣🤣🤣 F@ckin Awesome!
I welcome the sackings of the ultra woke so called employees.  Welcome to the real world you lazy scumbags 🤣🤣🤣
"content moderation specialist"? not a content moderation manager? I thought all these people were managers, other titles are for people that actually do something
Microsoft, Google, Facebook........all have the same laid back atmosphere that Twitter once had. If you don't have that, well, good luck bringing in computer engineers and coders- they didn't spend 4 years and 50k on college to be a slave
She should seek out a job at info wars :)
So I'm going to assume that you guys arent trolling everyone when you say that you're conservatives. But after watching a few sketches I don't think anyone will wonder why conservative comedy isn't more mainstream. The assertion that the billionaire bourgeoisie are out of touch liberals and definitely not old money country club conservatives, seems to be wildly accepted in today's Republican party. Maybe you guys will wake up one day and realize that the faux culture wars that are dividing our society has always been a misdirection preventing  Americans from realizing that corporations control both parties through bribery and propaganda. MSNBC isn't a liberal progressive news channel. It's corporate propaganda delivered in a shell of democratic talking points. Fox News is corporate propaganda served with red meat and potatoes. We don't have a functioning system of government that allows its citizens to have diverse political views spanning the political spectrum. We have far-right and center right corporate propaganda that tells us pronouns are important while our citizens are being treated like cattle only here in order to provide value for billionaires. We have a fentanyl epidemic killing 100k Americans a year but we haven't heard a single proposal to stop cheap opiates flooding wealthy and poor communitiesn
Priceless! Worthy of a spot on Saturday Night Live
I love it. Run away from the truth Snowflakes, run far away, hahaha.
It's funny because it's true
Wahaha
An inditement of this generation. U.K. there’s an advert for a recruitment agency where a young guy chooses a job based on ‘happiness’ rating, not location, wage, experience gained or needed….’happiness’ factor…..so glad I don’t have kids nor mix with them.
The ex Twitter employee was very effective in programming the potential future employer. She made him not say "work" in the first minute. Also the potential future employer was doing a lot of black hand. Trudeau approves.
She played corn hole … I bet she did get corn holed 😂
Hahahah😂
It’s funny…because it’s true!
Former Twitter employees can go work at Tinder. There is a T there.
I stopped Twitter because they let garbage like you on.   Now You Tube, what a shame more advertisors to contact.
Sadly, this is not too far from the truth.
Karen applies for a real work.  More fitting title lol
Grocery store cashier  next
Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg believe Big Tech has too many employees who are chilling instead of working  Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai recently interacted with employees at Google and Facebook and highlighted that their companies have way too many employees but the production and work is not in line with employee numbers, hinting that many employees are just chilling and not working.
Ban nudes from Twitter that will be very normal
Funny
Bee is back.
Lots of triggered red hat sheeple.
Everyone loves to hate on twitter, but people who work at home tend to work longer hours than those who work in the office, but generally don't get recognition for the work they do.
people in tech are not really struggling to find jobs, he sacked mostly well qualified engineers who wont have any problem getting well paid jobs.
Good thing papa Musk cleaned up this cesspool... The sсиm of the worl was collected in twitter employees...
Whose Steve from Fruitport, Michigan?!?!  Lol
i am sure they work hard at twitter. long hours.
This is even worse than woke humor
To me, the funny part was when the girl said she thought it wasn't going to work for her... like she was making the decision as to whether or not she got the job.  The word 'oblivious' springs to mind.
NONE...that includes intelligences of the mind.
LMAO...Thanks!!! QUITE enjoyable.
1:24  "buh-in".  What happened to our letter T all of a sudden?
Awesome!!!! I love it!!!
Everybody making fun of Twitter employees, low key want a work enviroment like Twitter had in the past. At the end of the day if you got your work done on time, who cares what you do in between.
I like her.
At my job one year at a vape shop , we went through 38 20 year olds in one year because they wouldn’t work and were so surprised when they were fired
I can't help but wonder if the actress was black and title was "Fired N****r applies for a real job" because thats all this video is, prejudiced hate speech spreading lies and misinformation disguised as "comedy", how long it would take before it was removed, preferably along with you from youtube?  The sheer irony given that its coming from a useless "Social Media Creator" who wouldn't know how to do real work is the only thing here that's funny.
I like how they do the corn hole roof top mimosas. Because it's not those things that make the Twitter folk and liberals suck. It's the fact they are lazy opinionated pieces of shjt
Welcome back to the Hellworld known as Twitter. You are all braver than me.
She should apply to work at Elon's Twitter next
So the joke is that people in skilled positions are able to command a comfortable workplace where their wellbeing is at least somewhat taken into consideration. Not sure why that's the joke, I was under the impression that we celebrate meritocracy in this country, but okay.
Why isn’t this a movie 😂
Lol, wow, is this what a conservative circle jirk looks like? (Ok, I did like the end though)
This is hilarious and so true. I would never hire a Twitter employee.
this is beyound accurate
That was the funniest shit I've seen
I got banned from Twitter for telling some kid Obama did not end slavery
This exemplifies the pseudo-intellectual, no-nothing, layout swine who no longer work for Twitter.  Elon will begin to hire real Americans who value the accomplishments that come with honest, hard work.
Loved the nod to Office Space!
I studied Communism in the 70’s…and I see the exact same applications being applied here in 2022….Like, WTF? I feel like I took a Trip and ended back in the USSR…..seriously, all these young people who have never lived it, are now behaving like young Commies…that’s Effing well scary…
Office Space two bob's interview scene rip off...
Spicy
Is this conservative humor ?
Sadly this is spot on
She looks like a hater...look at their judging face ....she's saying ...I will banned you (😡frown)
Yeah this earned my sub 😂 hilarious
They might do more normal work than some guy doing YouTube videos.
this is what boomers find funny? jesus christ that was terrible
I feel this is almost too true be funny
If you think that software engineers at big tech firms are lazy liberal snowflakes, you're dead wrong.  These people are basically expected to work like they have no family, friends, or hobbies.  Work is all consuming. I know this video is a joke, but the characterization just rings false to me.
conservatives are boot licking cucks..  your wife is taking a BBC laughing at you
Well if you were a fair organization I would feel for you......sorry liberals!
Lol
🤣 this is GREAT!!!!
This is dumb. Blocked
OnlyFans is always on the lookout for talent. 😉
BOOOOOOOOOORING, never a 3:45 clip felt so long and cheap
but they would search for jobs in the tech field
Funny how people criticize the software engineers and other people who keep a companys systems running as “doing nothing”. Until everything starts breaking.  When it comes to IT, if it looks like they’re not doing anything then that means things are working properly or they are maintaining it.   Look from Tales from Tech Support on redit for some interesting stories of companies that have literally been forced to close because they fired an important person in their IT department, who wrote the software that runs their stuff. All because the new manager “thought” he wasnt doing anything.
Hahaha.. it's probably more accurate than people are willing to admit, it's so embarrassing.. Elon did the right thing by blowing away the chaff.. Good job, Elon Musk!
Back in the shelter food line….
LoL 😂😂🤣🤣😆😆🤣🤣😆🤣 no thanks not them, never
just exactly what i had in mind when i heard 75% workers leave twitter... hahahah
Babylon Bee. Gave it another chance. Still not funny. Keep trying. Hire Liberals/Leftists to be your writers. They're naturally funnier.
Working at Twitter seems a lot better than my holiday lol
LOL
TBH, Hilarious idea but a shit execution.
Office Space reference for the win.
Perfect.Subbed
Engages in a manual labor.  That is the level.
She should mAke recommendations for people who want to work 😁✌️🤘🔥
Babylon Bee still isn't funny. Lame.
Is this supposed to be funny?
Wtf is a corn hole session? Sounds like something Beavis and Butthead would do. 🤣
The message of this video is:  Everyone is a pussy if they don't hang from the nuts of their employer.    No one is begging you to make things better.  We're TELLING you to make things better.  LOL  You fucking cowards that give your employers everything, scared to miss out on what bits might fall your way, you've given us the decrease in ability to buy a house.  You've empowered this death-by-a-thousand-cuts for decades.  You all can't wait to tell us how scared you all were the whole way...  You all are not even allowed to look at what other people have done in their countries.  LOL!  Just absolute cowards who can only follow orders.
This video = PURE GOLD
sluuuuuuuttttt i'd hit it
To be fair, a twitter employees job is as legit as yours...lol
This is gold...
I would like to thank Elon for cancelling the woke left lol
Maybe this is the first step in getting rid of things like 'pronouns in bio' and 'trigger words' from society. We may finally be healing as a society
hit the head on the nail.
Not one of you morons could have worked at Twitter.
definitely down to earth people!! lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So this is supposed to be satire yet it seems like it's pretty accurate. Employers have all types of fun at work type stuff but only after they are done
Mandy should seek a job eating corn dogs... really big ones.
Wait , Youtuber is a real job lol
I wouldn't hire ANYBODY that thought Twitter was a real job.
HAHAHHAA CONSERVATIVE HUMOR, SO FUNNY AND WITTY LMAO LIBERALS BAD
Toooooooo funny and probably real ‼️
So true!
I don't even know what a momosa
State Unemployment Agent for out of work Millennials
Dude looks like Michael Shannon
Exactly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So all it took to sensor the greatest minds in America was a bunch of Mandys?
OMG that is absolutely sensational!
If the have experience in manipulating search results, manipulating data and in censorship I hear Google is hiring.
lol I have to deal with people somewhat like this. they want to do about 1 hour of work in an 8 hour day, but really they cant handle an 8 hour day they always need to leave for one reason or another.....they do not last long with me.
Awesome video, but 2 missed opportunities: 1. Her assuming the grease was "blackface" 2. Her getting triggered by the boss calling her "Miss"
AOC…..
OH, GAD, SHE WAS SO REPULSIVE. 💀🤮 Heck of an acting job, lady. You NAILED IT ! 👌🙂
we will never  hire twtter employees.
hahahaha
Elon Musk taking over twitter is the beginning of everyone having the freedom of speech once again.  However let’s not forget he donated substantial amounts to obama bidden campaign. Therefore he is Partially to blame for this country becoming a laughing stock to the world.
how do you nail the toxic modern liberal so well????? what the heck! the major problem with this role is that liberals either look like freaks or unhealthy or both and this girls to hot... so thats the only way you lose me hahaha
Perfect
Modern women.
Matt Damon's Bitcoin Manager & Career Grave Digger
Sadly this is more fact than fiction..... When the unemployment runs out there will be chaos, many of the bloated woke Bullschitt companies are cutting loose a whole generation of incapable misfits that see self reliance as a foreign concept.
Person who writes conservative comedy for the Babylon Bee criticizes really smart people with actual employable skills about their job.
It's not me.  It's you.
Need to make a video 10 months later with no income....
lovely
Awesome
OnlyFans E-Thot is probably about her only option at this point.
Funny how all those "old fashioned" jobs are dying out by the numbers. People are not dumb to work 100% anymore and those who say will are lying. Any educated person goes 4 hours a day and than wastes time. Thats current situation like it or not. If you dont like those type of ppl there is old saying.... Do it yourself.
Accurate
Lol, literally true which is crazy thing, go Elon sharing a reality check with those useless freeloading Libs, welcome to real world b*tches !
Shit. I know Steve from Fruitport Michigan.
holy shit the acting is off the charts here. this is absolute cringe.
I want to see Mandy work at either a homeless shelter or hospice.
What does the expression corn-holing mean in this context? In the past it referred to anal sex. (Just looked it up, and it's a beanbag game. But, the old definition is valid)
Walmart next plz
Morgan is great
1:05 that joke went over 90% of peoples heads.
Just do what most of these hoes do Onlyfans
China knew very well how to ruin America by corrupting its youth
Its kind of sad but true.
I'm picturing her in a gluten-free candle shop.
Great! Those woke people blocked free speech and they should be punished for it!!!

Soo pathetically true and they have no problem showing you there day at Twitter,sorry fairy people Elon's here now,so work or get fired,I love it sooo much.these self entitled little never heard the word no wastes of space.
Lol.  No one at the Bee has ever had a manly job.  This bullshit is ridiculous.
this is funny
Wow the makers of this video are so out of touch with reality. They really think content moderation is just banning people you don’t like. It’s literally watching dead people get raped and cell video of school shootings, very traumatic shit.
bring your own guru 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Office Space reference “what would you say you did there?”
LOL, this is our woke culture big time ! most anyways not all
Why the jab on AA. Damn
"What would you say... ya did there?" Nice throwback! Had me rolling
solid boomer vibes in this one. no idea why youtube guided me here. keep dying off so we can inherit the disaster you left us and fix things. bye
Lmao.. too funny. Yeah, if that is what was working at Twotter was like, the ones thay got let go will have a serious reality check as they won't get hired by any real employer
What's concerning is this is probably not far from reality.
I’ve never had twitter but I got it now just to stick it to those losers that are quitting the company they can go off themselves
What a sad group of people you are.
This seems like a much more tame response from someone working at /for these fake leftist companies.  Remember that vegan transgender armenian jew gun nut who shot up youtube after getting de-monitized ?
this is painfully unfunny
wtf is a corn hole sesh ?
Lmao why am I always having to subscribe to y’all’s channel! Fuck you youtube!
Excellent job by the lady.
Now we need career politicians to do the same thing.
I thought the greese was gonna have her triggered, cause he was trying to "impersonate black  people wearing black hands"
Right. Cause senior engineers would totally aim for blue collar work when they were making $200k/year doing stuff far more complicated than anything taught in trade school.
The ending was awesome! And completely believable.
Fuck the left
why  Babylon Bee  got banned from Twitter?
i saw those twitter workers on tiktok and they didn't do any work, they just hung out in the lobby and cafeteria lmao
One thing I have to say to you all when I was growing up, here in the South " cornhole " had a whole different meaning , just saying.
It's hilarious reading the comments from all the hillbillies and bootlickers, thinking that a twitter software engineer will struggle finding another job. Keep sucking up to your bosses losers. At least you have your spite, to fuel your misery.
This person wouldn't have lasted a day doing content moderation and support work at any social media company lol
Ending was great - super twist - was not expected 👏👏👏
High tech employees are SCARY smart. You would not last a second. They would STEAL your job out from under you maggots.
This clip inadvertently explains everything you need to know about the FTX collapse...
Well as person from east europe who had first job in actual factory repasing huge office printers and part of my job was to clear 10+yo hvy used printers so at night I looked like coal miner....meet people like this makes me smile...every single time...
The Babylon Bee is hilarious, but their leaders believe they have a personal relationship with a man who died almost two millennia ago, making them just as crazy as the deranged liberals they so rightly satirize.
You idiots can apply for all the openings at twitter and FAIL. Your characterization of twitter employees as unskilled is beneath contempt. You are right wing hacks with no meaningful purpose in life.
What will Ligma Johnson do after he got fired from Twitter too : (
every org has a peta freak!
I work with a physician whose like this. Once she got the job, it’s “I don’t do this or that.” Woman is in her 50s!
That's how bad they brainwashed these kids adults 30-year-olds 20-year-olds
Good job Elon Fire all these garbage
I know this is a comedy sketch, but I feel like this is how the former Twitter would do for a job interview.
if this is what twitter employees did... good job elon!!!
I almost fell out of my seat laughing at the greasy hand. My hands tend to look like that, and worse, which, for me, is a sign it's been a good day where things got done. I call it "Useless millennial repellent". Nothing repels those dregs of society quite like grease and grime on the hands.
😆
That was just terrible, meaning great. As that is exactly how those whining liberal's think, and act, and breath, and sound, and take up our living space, invade our voting polls, and don't pay their student loans, and always vote democrat, and just live in general, and keep breathing, and reproducing, and use up all the toilet paper, and exhausting our non-renewable resources...
Dumb, but gorgeous...
I can't way till these snow flakes starv to death !!!!
And back to her parents basement.   That part is very real.
These are so close to the actual people who have dictated global culture for the past few years.
You can't get away with it, Babylon Bee.  That _Office Space_ reference at 1:06 couldn't hide from me.
ready to work hard 25 hours a day 8 days a week?
😂😂
This isn't a parody and that is what makes it funny.
She should transfer directly to Meta - open arms, hugs. 🙂
This is just like the doctor Lexus scene from Idiocracy......What I do is liiike....you know....
Nice job.  Too funny.  You all are brilliant.
The only place they are qualified to work is on Reddit as censors (moderators)
Wonder what company hires woke people when she gets hired we will know and why do we care who she works for if I get let go is anyone going to care where I go NOT lol
You guys at the BB are having too much fun with this aren't you?   LOL, keep it coming and vent away.
Elon needs a shirt that says “I spent $44 billion and all I got was a bunch of MAGATS” (the don’t believe in global warming and won’t buy my cars).
Does anyone out there actually find the Babylon Bee to be anything more than a second-rate, unfunny Onion?
Not an acting expert here but even I can see the lack of talent here.
As a 32 years old someone who was fortunate enough not to work a single day in my life outside of tech that felt kinda relatable 😂 (working as a Software Engineer is not a piece of cake at all but paying for my launches or seeing dirty hands sounds awful to me)
Who is this Steve from Fruitport, MI? :D
This about sums the whole "woke"  mess we are in right now !
Haaaa! She would love what medical staff came home with on their hands, shoes, scrubs... lol
Musk is brilliant.
I enjoyed watching that.  Great stuff.
Not wrong.
accurate from all accounts.
Wtf is a cornhole sesh
When we were forced to work from home, I actually missed going to the office - how sick is that?  (And by sick, I mean sick, not good…. Lol). It was much harder to stay focused on work when you’re actually still at home - I think I needed the office environment, much harder to work without it.   I wonder if anyone else felt like that?
Gen Z at their finest.
Your website actually gets it right…your site is garbage…🤮💩🤮
I used to work with this girl. Super cool chick, if you’re reading this I still hang out with your grandma a lot
@ps 403547 the little bitchness is strong with this one😂😂😂😂😂😂
Its funny Elon is ridding the company of the lazy liberal woke brigade, and now they have to actually find a job and WORK for their money, i think Hes making the right move 👍
I think it’s like three jobs for every person that’s available to work, so there’s a wide span of positions open, the problem is they don’t pay beans 🤔🫣
What a bunch of drivel....  this could be from Elon's propaganda department...
Actually I really kind of envisioned their work environment like this 😂
Kinda harsh really. This skit feels a little cruel to people getting their lives upended and loosing their job
I always wondered wtf Twitter employees did.
😆 🤣 😂
This is so hilarious.
Starbucks is looking for Christmas......er XMas....helpers.
nice office space spoof LMAO
not too far from reality I would say
aw hard feeling lmao were  you banned poor baby
At her 'eew', I'd have escorted her out with a 'have a whatever life'... Next!
You really don't want to work for that ass.
Excellent actress!
Welcome to the real world buttercup
the funniest thing here is how hard babylon bee committed to this dumb joke
what's her IG?
LMAO!!!!!
sounds about right to me.
#wearescrwed!
Onion wannabe
Let see Stripper, Prostitute, Drug dealer.
😂😂😂
Pay back time
Banning myself from YouTube for Liking this!
Nice propaganda
Si this is where the real comedy sketch folks have been this whole time. Here I thought snl had killed in a bad way the sketch scene. Hahahha
Lmfao
Twitter is a extreamly toxic place many hate users.. good job.
This is just how I seen the people at Twitter and Facebook .
Can't these pigs wear gloves? I work manual labor but understand what carcinogenic means.
Rooftop cornhole and mimosas, now that's what I'm talking about.
was this intended to be funny or just annoying?
Well, that is on point. hahaha
Former Twitter employees are jokes. So are libtards. Glad we've eradicated them from the platform. It's a safer, more trustworthy place now.
Who the fuck would want to hire these brain dead liberals anyways, they quit their job after being told they’re expected to work normal hours, 40hrs a week
Freaking hilarious. Ending was perfect.
Fantastic
Hahahaha hahahaha. What a masterful fuckyou to extwats. #nailedit.  Lolol. Lmfao
If its their first real job, that means the Rights new hero spent 44b on a not real company?
Poor Lena Paul
Oh sweet revenge :D
The fact that such a large company like Twitter could fire half of it's employees without Twitter experiencing any technical difficulties shows how inflated their company was and how little time the majority of their employees spent working. If any other company whose bread and butter revolved around their brick and mortar stores like Wall-mart did the same, they'd have huge supply chain, stocking and inventory issues that would likely lead to stores closing.
I think this is very funny. However, the words Twitter and Tweet sounds like Twits to me! Now I do not have any kind of so-called social media accounts so I am not familiar with what they are for or what they actually do, but I do have an idea that these entities allow anyone and everyone to say the dumbest and most ridiculous things they can think of and have other people read it and then comment with dunb and ridiculous replies! Am I right??
Sad how true that probably is
Damn cute redhead 🧑‍🦰.
Ya, we can't use you, thanks for coming in tho.........
Brilliantly accurate!
The flip flops at the end lmao
So many mad people that some Twitter employees did nothing all day but still got paid 200k per year. Maybe learn something and someone might pay you 200k to do nothing. :)
Yep. Looks legit. Pretty accurate representation of a work culture of average silicon valley start-up.(disclaimer: this comment is sarcastic)
My word you Americans really hate each other . Very sad and distressing .
It's funny because it's true 😂
Now you should really learn to code. Start with Visual Spastic.
Remember: You can't spell "Twitter" without TWIT.
LOL
Kkkkk so funny! Thank y’all & Elon Musk!
What? Work is a dirty word now?... Hmm the W word that shouldn't be spoken 🤔😕 😆
There is always work as a whore. Tyron is always looking for good ladies.
If these people were so "useless" how did they build a company worth 44 billion?
Don't forget also about free lunches....
I feel all the laid off buzzfeed staff were hired by twitter
If those folks are as useless as they’re purported to be, we were all actually better off they were rounded up sucking on advertiser and venture capitalist funds doing inconsequential “work” than out there in any place where there’s real consequences to their actions.
Classic... I loved it!
The internet is becoming fun again. Thanks to the assholes at YouTube. I still hate them and hope they get contagious penis cancer, but I appreciate the bee being back.
Tell me you have no idea what software companies do without telling me you have no idea what software companies do.
YOU MADE 6 FIGURES  DID YOU SAVE  You get walking away money
I have to say, I'm surprised so many conservatives are mocking Twitter employees - after all, without them, you couldn't post the n-word 48 times, get banned, and then complain about how conservatives are being censored while conveniently failing to mention why.  Really, they're doing you a service.
1:05 - GREAT office space reference ... LOL
Aaaaahhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha that's hysterical Aaaaahhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!! But so incredibly wonderful that finally maby Twitter can become usable for what it was meant for!!!!Aaaaahhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!
Well, I know what job Mandy should seek out next, but I am surely not allowed to post that here.
I know its probably all jokes but its kinda believable.
This barely even qualifies as humor, but I’ve totally figured out why. It’s not even meant to be humorous. It’s specifically designed with the purpose of stimulating a big circlejerk of insecure babies talking about how much they hate this group or that group, not because it’s funny or factually true, but it helps these sad, miserable, insecure children to feel better about themselves. When the meaning of your life simply becomes “owning the libs” you expose yourselves not only as being miserable, but also having no real beliefs or principles. When your very existence thrives on “I’m on this team and I like to trigger the other team because… something something woke and we hate them”, you really ought to take a nice long look in the mirror and reevaluate your life
The most accurate is the disdain for the working people while moralfaghing about how they are oppressed.
Enjoyed the Office Space reference
A youtuber pretending that being a professional software engineer at a mega-tech company is less of a real job that their job making these videos is so deliciously ironic.
amazing!
You should have her try to be a telemarketer next.  Like, she actually got the job and she's trying to actually do the telemarketing cold calls.
Conservative comedy is amazing 😂
Thats millenials everywhere now. The victim culture
Please keep them coming? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Feels like this video is pretty ignorant.
I thank God that I wasn't brought up with the work ethic or morality of a typical millennial.
Great make fun of people who just got laid-off.  Awesome.  I don't and never will use Twitter, but have more support for the workers in this country.  Why not take a shot at the clueless incompetent a-hole who bought and ruined the company.
Meanwhile this make believe video of Twitter engineers not having “real jobs” is racking in thousands of dollars; ah the irony.
Babylon Bee employee applies for first real job.  Jesus overturns his  table.
Working from home has created more productivity in years! Not sure why they hate it so much?
BYOG😂😂😂
Good actress 😎She made me hate her 😂😂
I can’t believe so many people like this trash. You all work in retail or something?
On point
Fluffer
Damn, that's too realistic to be funny.
They will create a onlyfans + open some legs
Is it too hard to believe that people like this actually exist?
4900 x twitter empoyes didnt like this
left wing scumbags.
OMG!!!, no wonder our country it's going  to shit with people Ike her on power.
these people never worked at walmart obviously.
This isn’t even satire anymore.
Cage free shrimp hahahha
Y'all continue to surprise me, day after day. Mimosas on me if I ever meet y'all.
Porn then have her cry about sexual harassment
Lmfao omg
Tired of all the over sensitive/ movements bs and people wanting a lifestyle specially women without doing real work I wish all of this OF/ IG/ Tik Tok stopped monetizing to see how they all come back to earth and be grateful to have a normal 9-5 and honest working dudes wanting to take them out. This has gone tooo far.
LMAO! Mostly laughing because this really isn't satire! There are pathetic excuses for adults like that truly walking this planet.
As a person who has put in the hours to work a startup I find this offensive.  Unless you have worked a startup you have no idea of the work and motivation it takes to make a successful business.  I am sure it took many hours of dedicated effort to get Twitter up and running, and many more hours to change the platform as circumstances changed.
i can differentiate if this is a sketch or reality, looks very real to me
Welcome back ❤
Love this!
error 404 - "workforce" not found.  It was just garbage collection and removal.
Elon Musk should have given more notice to his employees, you don't fire people with an email
The Babylon Bee is like the Onion, only their target audience is people whose idea of humor is to feed Drano to crows and watch them explode.
this is  1000000000000000000 %   ACCURATE ........ spot on.....
Some Leftist woke people are difficult to work with.
I see what you're trying to do.  The subject of people not having useful skills is in its premise a potentially amusing one, however you might want to try making your video about this subject funny.  Comedy writers aren't typically conservative and funny at the same time so I do see the problem you inherently have.  In about 10,000 years when Republiclowns have developed humour you may have a better channel.
Parody needs some truth to be funny. This skit is extremely funny.
What is a mam-moo-sah!?!?!?
🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣
Awesome video, now do those over paid truck drivers.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The real meaning of the word "millennial" aka Gen Z in disguise, ages 12-22 😉
This also works for HR "professionals". And I use that term loosely.
You truly have no real freedom. Its quite sad how you pretend to know about freedom, but just take a look at people working (not owning the company). You're slaves, real slaves. Not one single story has come from USA where the boss says to the employees to go home because they work too much. It doesnt exists in a land where slaves are used.
She doing quote well developing the fake speaking croak too
Yeah "software engineer" isn't a real job. It's a fake job that only snowflake lefties pretend to do. Elon Musk is very smart and definitely planned everything with the $44b deal he tried to back out of but then was sued into following through with. He definitely has handled it all really well. His rollout of Twitter Blue definitely didn't backfire in exactly the way everyone said it would. He was very careful when he purged half the company. Advertisers only care about advertising to liberals, so they're leaving the platform because of their woke agenda. Twitter employees are just lazy liberals. Because, you know, liberals are lazy? That joke lands every time. Hahaha. This is very clever satire.
😂
So many Elon dick riders 😂👍
The Babylon Bee: like the onion, but not funny and made for boomers who think Sam Elliot memes are really clever.
leftist garbage
She would have made fine waitress
Have her go to McDonalds for an interview..hehe
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💥💥🤣🤣🤣💥
she depicts perfectly the Gen Z population
Haha, I get it. Good working conditions are for lazy entitled people. The right has no respect for workers.
CNN qualified
Tell bae the mcdoanlds next to my house os hiring. You go girl
..." what would you say you did there?", lol. Only thing missing is the 2 Bobs.
At least she won't be working 80 hours a week making the new internet Nazi more money.
the aa joke was so out of place and dumb
Twitter = Titanic
Bangalore Anti-Bees, ears wax.
2 mins of silence for people thinking tech jobs are so easy.
Oh junk mail flagshippers Apple pie cooking.
I have met many Twitter employees and they were all incredibly smart and hardworking.
Could easily land a job in Washington, D. C.
Elon is the sinker of E, lost in his own mindset, etube it, about Apple 🍎 slippers 🥿 corn hold Hashtags library 📚 tadpoles books worm.
I thought she was going to comment on the wedding ring on his hand and talk about how it's a sign of the patriarchy.
Mandy is fkn useless!!!!!
Says the guys who never do manual labor.. as someone who does manual labor 11 hours a day, I say, fuck manual labor
as funny as terminal cancer.
brilliant...   content moderation specialist 🤣🤣🤣
That twist, tho! Actress absolutely nailed it, as did the writers with that "work" trigger avoidance.  Well done!
So funny, love it.
This is not just Twitter.  This is the youth of today anywhere.
Twitter got kicked off Twitter.🤣
BYOG 😂😂😂
Man the loud transformer fart in the beginning really startled me.
What a beautiful woman
It is funny by matching Elon Musk's characterization of his own employees.  Not that it would accurately depict real Twitter employees.  I very much doubt the company was filled with extremely lazy people before he bought it.  A profit motive tends to clean away lazy, unproductive staff on average.
Pretty much what I figured; MAGAs are contemptuous of smart people.  That's why they look down on anyone who actually finished high school.  You people wouldn't last a day in Mandy's old job.  Your little brains would explode like water balloons dropped from a third story window.  But don't worry about her.  She'll probably be working at Microsoft in a week making six figures while you're getting blacklung disease at your coal mine.  Enjoy your "real" job while it lasts, because someday you'll be replaced by an AI that Mandy helped develop.
The ending bit knocked it out of the park for me.  Thanks for the laugh.
Twitter 🐝
I think BJ specialist is about all she MAY be able to do. I think BYOC is in her near future.
Cry closet monitor
The end had me dying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI7tQ5Wm9o
This is a typical Gen Z interview
Class warfare between what's white collar and what's blue collar? This is what the billionaire class is pushing to keep us distracted from their tax theft operation.
Spoilt Brat
Elon musk is always right.
She should try to get a job back at Twitter
The end tho LOL
I used to work at an ad company and yes, they are like that.
So having a flexible work schedule, plus perks like drinks and food is a bad thing in the states? You people are so backwards.
Elon is a putz... with deep pockets... deep enough to fund propaganda like this video... and the acting was bad.
So conservatives are ignorant of IT work.
What kind of shit-tastic conservative propaganda is this? Too bad all those people with programming and coding experience would (almost) never actually apply to a labor job. Dumb.
LOL, they are fucking useless... LOL
Or she could work at any one of the other tech companies which will readily snap her up.  Why she'd want to go to work for you morons is beyond me.  You people are really stupid, you know what?
She should go for an interview as a mattress tester and complain because it only pays the time she's asleep +  2 hours awake to write  the mattress report.
This is probably a very accurate portrayal of the woke liberal terrorist employees at twitter.
Wouldn't mind enjoying her cornhole
Strangely, this would make more sense if it came out before the age of Twitter. Or computers. Computers, as it turns out, allow people to work from home. People do it all the time. You really should look into it. No doubt, everyone from The Babylon Bee reports to a big work building every day to do their work with nothing ever being done from home. On computers.  I can't stress enough how computers allow people to work from home. It's very common.  PS) Do the writers at The Babylon Bee do REAL work, like at Jiffy Lube, when they're not doing fake work, like writing hypocritical "comedy" sketches about what constitutes REAL work? Or do they just write between lube jobs? I'm very curious about this.
I liked the nod to Office Space.
too good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm surprised she didn't think the grease was blackface.
Office Space reference
This was hilarious!
1:04 Nice nod to Office Space
"the ad said 18 an hour..... but i need at least a salary of 200,000 with perks of 100k+ ok tyyyy"
Lol the right just can't understand how programing is not the same as factory labor and they all walked away with confidence because the need for skilled labor is through the roof.
SNL is way better.
She nailed the voice acting.
Good riddance!
Sad that people believe these type of work environment actually exist. Specially the ones in the comments section. Reality will hit you hard. 🤷‍♂️
Ugh, you conservative comedians are so HILARIOUS! Way to own those libtards who banned you on the twittwat. Please drive your Ford truck into a fucking brick wall at full speed!
Lol that was really funny
YES! Thank you! hahaha
*This would be even funnier if there were something REAL that was being satirized.*
Thats not grease, he clearly attempted to blackface.
that ending 🤣
Wow that was just like an interview I had!
First real job?  Was she performing a skilled task for money?  Yes?  Then it’s a job.  Let’s cut the BS on what a “real job” is.
the average salary at twitter is $120,000 which is likely more then 95% of people in the comments make. I don't really get all the hate.
test
Uhm. Pretty very sure this video is cribbed, because I watched it years ago.  BTW, nice sense of compassion. Looks good on a Christian satire page. ETA: Ah, here we go. "Millennial Job Interview." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo0KjdDJr1c
Egads, who or what would hire this airhead?
Of the first 50 suck up posts on this piece, 37 have at least 2 characteristics of phantom or Krembot posters. 11 appear to be from the same person who seems to have made it a business.
Hilarious
And sanitary napkins in the men’s room…God help us!
Musk paid for this? The right whacks have a whole bunch of these actors laid off from the Trump years doing fake crap, Neo Nazi memes, racist photos and such. This looks like an audition video for Orange Maggott Team #6. Hope Musk likes it because the last 3 checks from Trump for their "work" making up stuff for Trump, BOUNCED. They think MUSK could be their new meal ticket. If it gets them off welfare, unemployment and "skinwork" it could at least save tax money and cut the spread of STDs.
Thak you Elon Musk. bless your soul
I know it’s a skit, but we all know damn well an ex Twitter employee, or any other ex/future developers, would not go to work in manufacturing unless they’re desperate.
Poop on Twitter
maybe i'm just too educated for this to be funny.
OnlyFans is always an option ladies, and for some of you the ONLY option LOL
A NEET
With this high quality acting you both can always fall back on porn.
What's the new "learn to code" for these lefty turds?
Lol the end got me.
Imagine AOC needs a vacation from her difficult work and the only who applies as her "stand-in" (assume that's allowed) is mini-AOC, who out-AOC's real AOC and gets the job. It may not be safe yet, but "politician stand-in" is a great non-job job.   The question is, if a stand-in comes across inside information and capitalizes on it, does she owe all or some of the profit to the politician after the gig?  (am thinking Pelosi, not AOC for this one).
Very accurate video...lol
More useless TRASH we will have to support with our taxes....
every streamer who thinks what he/she does is a real job and also every "influencer" nowadays
Now we know who hired gender studies major people
I saw this headline and was like "That could be funny or that could be Babylon Bee propaganda". And then I saw who posted it.
I am old enough to remember the internet crash of 2001. In the preceding years I remember being at a party and talking to people who were making 150k plus for making basic web pages.  None of them ever made it back into tech.
Janitor work would give her mental health issues. LOL
no swimming pool - no job application... oh yes and You need to have spa at place where i work haha
another swing and a miss for babylon bee, trying so hard to fail at being funny
Where is Bob and Bob?
Brutal ... I need some safe space time ...
Corny
So much elon dick sucking must make your jaw hurt right?
Oh wow, l didn't know BB did this sort of thing.
Go back to Israel, judefachists!
Wow, lots of Elon stans here. You lot are weird.
disney i guess
Simply outstanding. Welcome to the real world.
Funny how she's aggressive when banning but when working timid.   Typical
What is really sad is that I have actually interviewed people like this.
Loved it.   That actress played her part perfectly ...
And yet these employees somehow managed to build a company for which some genius paid 44 billion dollars.
LMAO love this!
OK, didn't even watch this but that has to be the greatest video title ever. I don't think anyone actually did anything at Twitter.
This kinda sounds about right, Not a good thing, But sounds right.
Elon needs to watch this
When these Twitter employees banned the Hunter Biden story and blocked it and froze the New York Post's account you saw how politicized Twitter is -- and they weaponized Twitter when it freely encouraged stories from anonymous unsubstantiated sources that harmed their political opponents. Elon Musk should be celebrated because he has built a car company from nothing that produces electric cars and lessens the use of fossil fuel -- and yet -- ex Twitter employees call him evil -- you know who is really evil? a multi billionaire who shorted Tesla stock to drive its value down and hurt the company -- thats what BILL GATES DID -- gates = evil. Keep cleaning up Twitter Elon -- happy he rid the company of the perception managers who brain wash the mass populace into thinking what they want them to think.
1:05 love the Office Space reference.  I could feel him channelling the same energy as the Bobs.
I can always rely on you for good Christian love. Especially from the comment section. Such wholesome people.
Love the Office Space reference 😂😂😂 “what would you say… you did there?”
Government job... it is 100% same 0-productivity than twitter
OMG and she looks like the graph-ql-non-engineer 😂😂😂😂
It's going to be an eye-opening experience for all of these ex-Twitter employees who won't ever hold down a job anywhere else.  I wonder how many of them will go back to Twitter and beg to have their old job back?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is not even a parody; it's a documentary.
I know this is parody, but it's not far from truth.
Lol stupid americans making fun of other americans getting laid off...elon is going to ship these jobs offshore...thanks for the new jobs in my country losers. 😄😘
No more free foods must be killing them for real
It's unlikely most of the depicted woke 'x' employed will come close to their previous salaries including additional compensations.
Great! 👍
I can't believe they found a wizard for this skit
When he said "grease", I expected her to say "The country??" and how they would have exploited them for manual labor.
Haha, I truly wish they don't find any jobs and starve. experience hunger and pain of reality on their spoiled 1st world suburban white girl arses. also on the streets, somebody should punch them in the face. that would be such a tasty humble pie to these California rotten kids
Ok, this exaggerated "satire" video is starting to make sense.  "The Babylon Bee is a conservative Christian news satire website that publishes satirical articles on topics including religion, politics, current events, and public figures. It has been referred to as a Christian, evangelical, or conservative version of The Onion."
Holy shit this is hamfisted as hell. "Hey let's take every trope we can think of and shove it all together with no original thought."
And that's how, gentlemen, Babylon Bee understands the management of a 240,000,000 people community worldwide: not enough grease and manual work for him. So thinks Elon Musk, coming from Tesla/SpaceX mechanics.
Lol... I thought she was going to go with black face when he put up his hand. Twitter is the app happy people go to to becomes angry, depressive and cynical... Ban Twitter
Work sucks we can all agree on that. It was created centuries ago for us slaves to the rich. None of us like work but we have to. That's life. Work hard, get paid. Do what you want with your cash you only get a small window of life to do anything then you age and die. Fuck everyone else and the views they have on you or life.
This must be the right wing safe space for people who want to imagine what Twitter employees think like. I got banned on twitter for cussing at right wing trash. Yet the conservative soy boys think twitter is full of lefties.
Yoo this is a true. Some mid 20's girl from my church went off on me about white guilt and talked like this meanwhile when she was done I was like I'm half black too and came from the projects. Then she was like well then you're just a confused black man voting wrong and I was like no I came from shit and know democrats lie to get black votes as they been saying the same crap to me since I was old enough to listen to Bill Clinton do it. Plus I said BLM never showed up on Compton to help but did show up to gated rich communities for liberals in hollywood. She then blocked me from facebook and email.
How about she tries being some kind of Crisis Hotline Worker.
This is painfully dreadful to even watch mostly because these sorts of people are said to be the USA's future--WTF?  Yeah I'm old but at no time has this country had such a lazy, clueless and weak workforce.  Its sad seeing this sort of thing and yes I also realize this was meant to be humorous---it hits the mark there 100%.
I wonder how many of her job responsibilities and job perks were real responsibilities and perks at the old Twitter.
She'd make a perfect "professional" activist.
I get anxiety watching this.. I know its true
How many times is this going to play out in the coming weeks : )
this is my job
She should learn to Code.
The whole world is making fun of these people. This makes me hopeful for the future
she should practice saying "do you want fries with that?"
More documentary than parody!  Kudos to the actors in this video - OMG!!!!!  LOL!!!!!
He called Her "Miss" !!!!!      If I'm sitting on the Jury during Her discrimnation lawsuit , She's getting AT LEAST 401K ......
Even if Twitter tanks, though I doubt it will, getting these useless people out into the real world was worth the takeover.
Lol. The entirety of Silicon Valley is useless
I'm curious the reference to Fruitport, MI.  I don't live too far from there...
So Musk is a genius who overpaid for twitter and is now in the process of wrecking it and the best "satire" BB can come up with is making fun of what they imagine twitter employees to be like?   Way to bury the lead.    Here's a better one:  Billionaire buys yacht, invites everyone on board and they trash it.   Now the yacht is worth a helluva lot less and for what?
Elon Musk is just getting rid of the dead wood, something Trump should have done when he took the White House in 2017, these liberal cancel culture trolls need to go, they're parasites
First real job? STFU
Since leaving Twitter, her pronouns are was/were 🤣🤣🤣
“What would ya say… Ya do here Bob?”
Congratulations on your triumphant return BB, and God Bless you all for the barbed wit and charm.
I worked in a twitter like company I was ashamed every time I was paid, legal theft. I am on team Elon
with the skills they needed to work at twitter, the best job they can get now is working in fast food.
So another weasel word for Factchecker is "Content Moderation specialist". Learn something new today.
"first real work" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🥰🤭🥰🤭
Here is the thing Twitter was used by the left and the right. With Elon on the republican side as well as reinstating the president where a big minority was against it those people won't stick around. Also companies won't advertise or atleast way less they don't wanna risk losing costumers.  This could turn in a giant loss for Elon's wealth. Freedom of speech almost always insults when inacted. Otherwise you could just post it and no one would care. And what about freedom from racism or religion.
Twitter employees didn’t work while they were employed.
This is fukkkking stupid
I love it.
Just think, ex Twitter employees working at McDonald's handling your food. THE HORROR.
Looks very similar to what I see in big 4 consulting.  Most of them can't boil water.
Can we do Miss Alexandria Cortez the Latin Mouth running woman next?
BAWHAHAHAHAHA...love it! I heard these mindless employees at Twitter made 285k a year! Absolutely sick!
We have this problem here in all of the German Companys and especially in government organization.  Live now and work later.
Love the Office Space reference..
🤣🤣🤣
Aww... Republicans are really trying their best to get a catch on elon musk... Pathetic 😪 even interestingly Republicans think only menial work is real work🤣🤣🤣🤣
the stoopid Cali accent.... it gets on my nerves.... a question mark tone at the end of every sentence That actress did it correct
The acting is absolute on point of todays generation... (actually I am todays generation) and I hate her so much .... and the stoopid Cali accent it gets on my nerves....
Twitter employees leaving because they don't agree with the intensity of Elon Musk is missing a big opportunity especially for the younger demographics. I'm currently enjoying work from home setup but if Elon Musk will ask me to go to work everyday and have a chance to build something with the richest man on the planet then hell yeah! Let's get it on!
What is crazy is people just like the character in this video banned The Babylon Bee from Twitter, and that ban motivated Elon Musk to buy Twitter.
😂😂I gues this is not far from the truth
Nice try Elon
Sounds like any Millennial or Gen-z to me.
lol 😂
you guys are freaking LLEGENDS!!!!
This is notfunny.
Probably NOT that far off from true!
nut job leftists
I dont think she would be hired as a hooker. MAYBE a drug mule for ms13. Probably screw that up too.
Times have change 👍🏻 Wake up call to all those LAZY ASSHOLES...🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍🏻🙏🏼
Silicon Valley! This is what you get when businesses become monopolies
They need to learn to weld!
this is actually reality now - incredible.
😂😂😂
Brilliand usless twitter worker ha ha
So the joke here is that IT workers don't actually do work?  That seems pretty tone-deaf after Elon demanded 80-hour weeks.  This is pretty fucked=up
When you care more about a stupid social media platform then some dude wasting $40 billion on a stupid social media platform...  The shit people care about is beyond depressing.
I'm not sure what a Mimosa is? Some type of alcohol-based drink consumed by the lower classes? Mandy will be fine; her skill set is much in demand in the upper echelons. Those guys and their work is being automated out of existence. The future is here now and it's going to eat you up.
This isn't a comedy flick this is a 1:1 documentary on the life of former "workers" at twitter!
Twitter was always a shit platform!!  So glad Elon cleaned house!!
This is the part of society I can't wait to collapse
Ha ha ha, that's the hallmark of great comedy, satirising the banality of actualitite. On a serious note, those ex Twatter muppets' are all f*cked going into the real world!
This may apply to HR or any other positions but twitter had some of the best software engineers. They will have zero difficulty finding any additional job.
Ok guys this is brilliant.
High paying low productivity ppl? Lol
Lol.
Too bad I can't give the "Bee" millions of likes for this!  LOL
no offense but that woman already just looks like a walking red flag. Not counting language, behaviour and gestures.
the worst part is -------- thats his daughter, yah really.
I’m looking forward to the day when Elon Musk applies for a real job.
Those ex-twitter employees are the first ones to go onto the B-Ark
Not to bizarre so many like that today,living in a land that reality comes second to Hollywood.
Why Fruitport Mi though? That's my hometown.
When you realize that was not an actress, but this was hidden camera 🤯
I'm glad these degenerates believe in child free existence as they must never reproduce.
NRA Political advisor!?!
I used to work for Twitter.  NEXT !!!
Great example for people with a grain of a brain to see how part of America fell for some orange criminal clown
What in SNL is this. Are we still in the 2000s or something, who even does skits
also Musks factory is not working . Teslas shares are plumeting so his wealth. so musk lickers save your own ass,
I love this....😄😄
he engaged in manual labour hahahaha
LOL
This isn’t satire. This is the way ex Twitter employees think.
😂😂😂😂Looovely!!!
Salaries at Twitter range from an average of $75,294 to $173,991 a year. Twitter employees with the job title Senior Software Engineer make the most with an average annual salary of $148,662, while employees with the title Software Engineer make the least with an average annual salary of $114,036. They weren't dumb kids.
Hahaha
I’m sure there are other job opportunities for a loser like her…
Does no one else think its bad karma to make fun of people who just lost their jobs? Admittedly the video was funny...but sheesh--wait a month at least! First, have some sympathy for the fellow humans you inhabit the world with. You know..."Love they neighbour"...or is that conveniently tossed away at a chance to make a  profit?
What's funny is most of those employees will get a 5% raised somewhere else and make well over 100k a year. While their counter parts will still be at their serving jobs with zero benefits, shitty pay, and shitty hours.
so fake and such a lie. lol
She can always transfer her skills to a government/union job...
Funny video, but the end really cracked me up! 😄 I must admit I don't know the background for the video (other than the basic fact that people were fired).
It's funny coz it's true!
I love this world now. So much opportunity for the blue collar work force. Took all of my companies from $100k 7 years ago to now having 5 companies and 8 figures now. Thanks lazy liberals
Wow, she's not just very pretty, she's a pretty good actress as well. Well done, BB!
Babylon Bee not real smart.
Loooo that ending
I think Mandy should be a call girl. If making herself up is not to much work. She can be wined, dined and laydown on the job.
She's into it, but the other two are cringy as f. Get professionals actors fhs. Sad fact: writers can't act.
Reality is a bitch, Love the bitch. Be the bitch.
I think that narrative is funny but totally bs
So sad, but so funny! 😂😂😂
You are making fun of people just like you. How on earth do you idiots think that you are better people?
lol
Bullshit.
Yeah right, you think THEY are banning people? The actual people deciding to ban/not ban is somebody paid 50 cents an hour sitting in Chennai or Manila. Twitter had 7500 US employees, most of which are in sales, taking care of the big multi million $$$ advertisers, plus a bunch of engineers. The actual moderation team is like 10 people, plus 500 offshored non-employees (they are employed by the contracted companies), handling 500 million tweets a day.
Is it bad that I think she's hopelessly cute? :)
A Twitter employees go stick cheese on my burger
I wouldn’t hire anyone from Twitter a bunch of lazy entitlement liberals… stay on the unemployment line …go sit there in front of the White House and beg for Biden support
This latest generation is devouring itself , dont think for one minute Elon does not know that...
This is propaganda
she plays brilliantly , i have some like her at work (real life :D) ...
I would leave aswell when elon musk took over XD i mean 12 hours a day 6 days in a week, you would have no life left
that's what elon musk is talking about
Thanx to elonmusk  to fire indian spy in Twitter.. They spreading hate.....
Who wrote this? I’m just curious what Steve from Fruitport did to you.  Was a funny call out for me tho.
I couldn't stomach to watch the final minute. This is typical of so many young people. They all want the glitz and glamour, high paying jobs and what not but they have no idea what hard work actually is. It's sad, but it opens the world up for those who want to work! Moving on.
Fuck this is stupid.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Very nice depiction of the "gen P" (generation Puxxies).
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔨🔨🔨🔨👍👍👍👍
Anybody out there know how to code?  Asking for a billionaire friend.
This is going to age so well when the dumpster fire takes hold because Elon has NFI how it all works but thinks he does!
lovin the office space reference.
Sadly this is probably more real than we may think.
Are people actually like this?
She should go to a MEPS and record. We'd be using all the trigger words for a laugh.
I feel for the boss in the video.. I'm only half thru.. and I'm in pain my head hurts.
I literally tried to hit the ' XD ' emote in the corner of video, that's how funny this shit is.
Video should have been about Musk, Soros, Rockefellers, Rotschilds and such lizards. *Video should describe superriches trying to get a real job instead.* Not their slaves!
It can't be 100% ruled out that that woman is not the exact same one that did the daily walkthrough TikToks working at Twitter.. hauntingly accurate.
It's funny because it is true.
Wow so hilarious. Love hearing the millenials lazy joke for the 10 thousandth time. Seriously though, keep licking that billionaire boot. Hope you think of all the times you betrayed the working class when the .1% take everything you have.
"They can pretend to work somewhere else." E. Musk
shes just a twitter employee who the hell cares there all worthless...now the californins movin to texas thats important...
The Bee thinks that tech workers just swan about all day drinking coffee and mashing keyboards. Lotta projection there. Just saying. I mean the prime example of useless job is online comedy... and oh...oh no... no no no.. I mean you don;t even provide a service...
how stupid liberals are
Haaaa hahaha the real sad thing … Its all too real for those nitwit “workers”
Next episode have just come back to interview with Twitter. Lots of funny things you can do there. Have Trump interview her.
Or maybe the ones who left were the ones with experience and skills to find work at a better employer, and the ones left are the ones with no options. Seen that play out many times
Spot on, mate! Thanks!
Disturbingly accurate portrayal of a Twitterite. It was an adult daycare.
Twitter a scourge. I'll be happy when its gone.
Hahahahaha ask a sissy liberal to do some work and they puke.  Priceless ... maybe they can join the homeless where they belong Hehehehehe
Right wing comedy…. The worst in the world!   All based on lies and pure projection.  But a good insight in how right wingers see the world!  Right wingers are unable to provide the world with anything meaningful.
street walker is their best bet
AHAHAHAH
Cool. unfunny "comedy" writers and youtube tier actors telling us what real work is. Literally, the closest they get to work is cosplaying.
Maybe Facebook will hire them
What an asshole, presuming her gender and calling her miss. How inappropriate
This is plagiarism
The ending😂😂 so good
hilarious
Haaa, ha!
basicly worthless lazy idiots. like many other offices in the gov. they go there 7-4. work only half and hour to two hours.... crazy
this is a job for labourers twitter is for inovators asshole,
There's musk and that dame 🪠 toilet
All these ppl in the comments with their miserable job and payments being treated like cattle trying to reassure themselves that "choosing a real job back at the good ole steel mill" because they needed money to provide for their child they got back in highschool was a good idea😂😂 i promise yall these Twitter employees dont need to work a day for the rest of their lifes... Just go ahead and vote trump so we get even more money working even less while he tells you he does what he does to help working class
"Fired Twitter Employee Applies For First Real Job"  - A YouTuber
Even the hard workers of the first world sometimes look like spoiled brats, to most people from the third world. For some time i were working 80hours per week with no registration.
This is too real and too funny lol
I’ve been to Fruitport ,MI before.
The funny thing is, software engineers work some of the longest hours and do very intellectually challenging work.  The real reason their salary is that high and companies bend over to please them: the work is difficult, the hours are long, and there are not many people, especially in the US, that can code!
Twiitter Twats from the Left are about to get f****d
How sad it must be to be an employee with zero skills to do anything.
the OTHERS are BAD ... aren't they?
I bet she would've had a full on seizure if he told her the starting salary was like $34K
Twitter ex-employee can work in CNN to make more fake news
I moved from running my own construction company to middle management at a nonprofit and believe me this is not off the mark.
ALRIGHT LISTHEN UP 100k and a high school acting class and we can make better content than this channel anyone willing to invest please contact if interested
1:04"Two Bobs" in the house!
None ha ha 😉😉😉
This is too Funny and Sad and all too True!😅
I would have a problem hiring any former employee of twit.  Too much natural hate built into their minds.
Imagine a world with only liberals vs a world with only conservatives. Which would you rather live in? WHOA
Who gonna hire these good for nothing?
PRICELESS
Very accurate 😂😂
Comedy.
I was literally breaking rocks (on trails for pedestrians and horses in the national forest) at the age of 15 for $6.75/hr wtf...
All joking aside, this is what today's generation is like.
The sad part is there's probably an incredible amount of truth to this skit for many of those woke & privileged twitter employees that got fired.
Yes, it’s time to grow up and get a real job!
Robotic voice: the Babylon bee is having issues atm with creating brand new skits since reality is getting more crazy than Babylon bee can handle.   Jokes guys ^
send that left morons to cuba , venezuela or nicaragua for job.
😄
I’ve never seen an ad while watching the Bee. I guess it’s the best way to watch ad free YouTube!
More of this genre!!
I hate this video because of how it shows how fucking wrong she is its insulting my IQ and self conscious, but i enjoyed it
I definitely feel this deserves a solid passing grade.  I’d say it deserves at least a Bee!
This is like an average Democrat in the work force. That's why they prefer to Occupy stuff (steal), identifying that all possessions are theirs.
"What would you say... ya did there?" :D Classic well-placed reference!
"Steve, from Fruitport, Michigan" was my friend!
More divide-and-conquer propaganda. 🥱
Wish Babylon Bee didn't put handheld camera sway on every shot.  It wears you out.
I wonder how many of these kids today know that Cornhole   means fucking someone in the ass?
No 'So, we have other candidates for this position" speech? What kind of HR doesn't have this memorized like autonomous reflex by now?
Musk will likely find it harder to find a elfless passionate engineers in a saturated social media market, where the product is a lot less inspired than rockets to Mars or self driving cars.
I have to imagine most of the people laid off were in software and no company would function if half its software engineers were dead beats. Maybe 5 or 10% were.  Guarantee twitter will have to shit can half it's microservices over the next few years if they managed to chase off all the engineers who worked on them.  What's left may or may not be a competitive product.
Brutal🤣🤣🤣
And then she gets in her car and drives home after the interview.   The one that a mechanic with greasy hands has to maintain for her to be able to drive lol
Cant believe this girl came up thru Twitter
This is an amazing skit
What is momosa??
Exactly the kind of bullshit i expect from the bb. Real satIre is based in fact, not lies and bullshit
This vignette was very smartly done.  You got Mandy to quit, and not just to quiet quit, either.  You got her to quit out loud!  Firing her would have required a lot more documentation, along with some kind of performance improvement plan, or whatever HR calls it.  I think I'm going to keep a dip of dirty grease handy in case I have to shake hands with Mandy or one of her friends.  😏
Working at twitter truly seemed like a dream job. Great free food and almost no work.
🤣🤣
I love the thumbnail...applies for a " real " job. 🤣🤣🤣 about all those entitled overpaid turds got sent packing. Thanks Musk.
She can open an Onlyfans
This is a total BS. A lot of hard working people were fired and you’re making fun of them
How about a rewarding job in waist management..
I'm sure Prince Andrew would love to give her one , and a job . 🤣🤣🤣🤣
As history shows every madness sooner or later gets a reality check 🙃
Wait, was that a parody or a documentary?
Love the Office Space "the bobs" reference
The definition of irony is a youtuber posting about "real jobs"
Maybe she can get a job as a bartender.
*Idk if y’all that before and after photo of Twitter employees, but the only employees that stayed are people that are actually programmers and do work and not just sit around drinking wine and talking about gossip*
Pronouns they them
AI should be doing all physical labor, and just all meaningless jobs anyway.  We already get very little time alive, it’s such a waste having to spend so much of it doing stuff you don’t care about (often for pathetically low pay).  I just don’t get it. What value people get from “hard work”, to me it’s just a chore to cause more misery and doesn’t feel worth it. It’s slavery to me. And no, I don’t do drugs, but wish I did sometimes.  Nothing feels like it serves any purpose or point anymore, sometimes even things I used to enjoy. No, it’s not just depression.   Nobody understands. It’s not just laziness or depression.
I love the hate the right wing has for twitter employees who are 10x smarter than your average right winger.  The jealousy is so thick from y’all, you wish you were half as successful.
Elon is hiring.  Seems like the genius Billionaire makes stupid moves, unless his goal was to destroy Twitter.  Fire first then figure out what they did.
Fuuunnnyy
haha........ sums up last 2 generations.
😂😂😂
When you start judging other people by what they do for a living… thats kind of shitty. The left used to do that and those of us on the right hated it. But now the right is doing the same thing 10 years later. 😅 Hypocrisy?
I guess they code learn how to write code.
Way to go Elon! They can come work with me in construction!💪😎
😂😂😂
Babylon Bee still upset over getting its feelings hurt.
This is so cringe and so are the comments. Satire should be funny with shades of truth this is simply defaming a group of people with most viewers blindly gobbling it up as truth.  You guys watch too much Fox News lmao
🤣😂🤣
Should have had her ask what her severance would be.
Okay. This is just stupid. Being a software developer is a real job. It just requires you to use your brains rather than your physical body.   Just coz you were too dumb to finish your education doesn't make your job a "real" job.
😁
THe ending is good.
Not surprised to find right-wingers dont have a clue about working in technology
subtlety of a sledgehammer
Man what a knee slapper
LMFAO............ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣........ a million levels high!!!
Just start a podcast and call it your not allowed to speak.
repeat after me, " Would you like fries with that"
Most of them are software people. They're educated. They have experience. Their skills are in high demand. I doubt they'll have much trouble.
I'm sure my only interaction with Mandy would be if my card didn't work at the pump.
That girl needs to whiten her bottom teeth to match the top ones. They're really yellow
Most employees from tweeter only know how to job hope on computers and have a set pay....
Maybe she could write jokes for you losers as this garbage isn't even remotely funny. She couldn't do any worse than you morons.
Coping an afternoon cornholing.
Jesus Christ this is corny as fuck
LMAO !!!!   Elon, please make sure these entitled xxxxs never come back !!
What moron employees.  Glad Elon bought Twitter.  The dummies can now leave.
Millennials. Humpf
Sad how we used to think this kind of sarcasm would never become reality, but it has! The female in this skit was exactly how they are except she didn't hurl any f-bombs.
blizzard/activision/Bethesda lol ah a toxic sexist work environment
This video is about as stupid as spending 44 billion dollars on a company that wasn't worth that LoL.  Now that's comedy!!!
Thank you Elon! Thousands of people sitting and doing absolutely nothing. Charging people for pixels and living in a fantasy world!  Finally a businessman stepped in and gave them a reality punch!  Now I hope the other platforms follow up and do the same thing! The right thing!
live it!
Atlast Twitter can be run by human beings , not morons from another planet and the ex employees can be drafted into the forces  👍
Musk Copium
every job i have ever had was demanding landed printing job with state they were demanding to for thirty years do the bast you can take it as it comes.
This Mandy character is a great actress. I know she's playing a role, but it feels like it's really her. I can't stand this character, lol.
I wouldn't hire one Twitter, Meta, Google employee.
it's actually pretty funny that so many idiots actually believe the employees who made Twitter worth 44 BILLION dollars are just a bunch of lazy bums who should work in gas stations or restaurants....  I mean you can't make this up. The irony is insane and it shows how bipolar some people are. Completely lost touch of the reality and live in the opposite world
I'm sure most of them will find employment in government service, where they will continue to be a huge drain on the economy.
Still love Kyle Mann, but ever since Seth Dillon kicked Ethan Nicolle out the door, The Bee seems to be a weak parody of its former self.  Kyle Mann and Ethan Nicolle were an unbeatable duo.  Still waiting to find out what happened here; what a disappointment.
Entitled Americans. Deserved to be destroyed.
Should apply for a job at etsy, they only seem to do charity work and let bots deal with the rest
Twitter isn't real. Their jobs weren't real. No Twitter no pity
She is probably on OnlyFans already!
Musk should buy internet and shut it all down. So all you retards would have no choice but to wake the fuck up.
That is cool!!!!!
They won’t need jobs.  They have been living with their parents for their whole lives
Having broken my back labouring and done over ten years office and other work I am glad she will also get the opertunity.
Now do one where they have to get a job because they’re hungry.
why is YT suggesting I watch this POS channel.
if you were a twitter elite then good ridance?
Her character makes my mind ache migraine wise...
ITT a bunch of people who think ex-twitter devs are going to go do blue collar work lol.
the funny thing is that this isnt even satire
Maybe this snowflake bitch can be a convenience store clerk?
exactly
What is wrong with this generation so weirdly sheltered from reality
As someone who has lived in LA for the past 20 years, this girl just oozes self-involved actress. So cringey.
The irony of an employee at the babylon bee making this is hilarious. You work at a shitty right wing comedy company that recycles the same boring trans jokes over and over again. YOU don't have a real job lmao
This is a ridiculously ignorant video. I don’t even work in this career field. This feels like some failed attempt at boomer humor.
God help humanity
funny AF...
Good job, very funny. 👍😄
Was that a nod to Office Space at 1:05?
Lol she’s gonna have to live of mommy and daddy😊
Maybe she can suck cock for a few pennies...
How do these people even get jobs 😂
About the only thing she could probably do now is OF.... lol
a "real job" is any set of tasks for a business that is associated with a regular salary. Irrespective of how anyone feels about twitter it was recently sold for $44B so I'm not sure precisely what joke you are trying to tell
Hear those African diamond mines are cushy gigs
LOL.  Trump is Back!!!....    https://rumble.com/v1wbork-guess-whos-back.html
Ex twitter employees, punk ass bitches who can't hack it in the real world
hahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahah, this is EXACTLY how i felt about Twitter dicks
@2:46 - she was actually cringing from the wedding ring. 🤡🌍
It's such a weird take on the situation, acting like the Twitter employee leaving are just not willing to work hard. Let's try a very apt analogy I recently heard:  Let's say you're a contractor on a company's payroll. You were originally set to do the foundation on 5 2000 sqft homes in cul-de-sac in Atlanta, you're 2 houses in. Now someone buys out the company you work for, and the new owners tell you they are changing the project to 5000 sqft homes in another state, except they've fired 80% of the other contractors, and expect you to do the additional work at the same pay. You staying with the company??  You might want to consider if you're backing the wrong horse if you're in support of what Musk is doing here.
Lol Morgan.
a whole new way for billionaires to remove non unionized workers and cheat them of their rights..Those workers that are stereotyped mocked and then discarded will be you tomorrow. Musk at twitter, is no different to Bezos at Amazon or trump at his moribund casinos.
now hopefully she'll go and find a real job,  now maybe she'll learn what it's like to get up in the morning and bust your ass like so many of us middle-class Americans..
Just wait until YouTube content creators have to go out and get "real" jobs. Imagine THAT shitshow for interviews.
Perfect. I really hope there's not really people like that in the US
I can see a painful future for these useless people... thank you so much Elon, starvation will teach them the truly meaning of HARD working.
This is how I actually picture all those ex-twitter woke pseudo worker
Elon Musk got played by Twitter execs and now has been exposed as someone who's too dumb to have money.
Worse than SNL. YOU DID IT,
He's already begging the software engineers to come back. No one seems interesting in working for this big of a jerk though.
I enjoy the Twitter users that spent so much time and effort building their brand, create a following and filling a void in their pathetic life.  Now that Elon Musk is in charge they are conflicted cancelling their woke account with the risk of losing all of their hard "work" on their Twitter feeds.
Lmao so many butthurt laborers in the chat
"IF" people like that exist , they no doubt are fully +  immunized against covid 19 .....serves them right.
The real world is so unkind to snowflakes. They need a reserve where they can be protected from reality.
This was a great video idea. If only the acting were good and the dialogue were funny.
This is the entitled American youth they think that they can't do anything you want to talk about the downfall of society you're looking at it with everyone of these idiot millennials who thinks they can't touch anything nor do they learn anything I give it 20 years and China's probably gonna take us over cause there won't be anybody to fight back
Twitter moderated content as they did, not because the employees were woke leftists, but in order to maximize the ad revenue from mainstream companies, who are the ones who set the standards for what they wanted to be associated with.  Without them, Twitter will have to shift to relying on fees ..
🤣😂🤣
Let's be honest - these employees would be getting unemployment; they wouldn't be applying for these types of jobs.  Remember, the median Twitter engineer's salary is $308,000 per year.  These jobs would be "below" them.  https://archive.ph/CAwh9
Well done Elon!!
"What would ya say you did there ?"     Love the "Office Space" reference....lol
Black hand is so... RACIST!
i like her though
Part 2: she ends up suing the company for emotional hardship and for a possible attempted assault with the intent to poison. (Remember, he had grease on his hand when he offered the handshake).
This video is so embarassing
Corn Hole meant something completely different when I was young.
Haaha twitter girl no understan how too work and consermative boss just wan to help. My children don't talk to me because they got transed by MSNBC
Idk, maybe it's a generational thing, but 'cornhole' and 'cornhole sesh' must mean something other than what I'm thinking (however I'd definitely hire her if that's what she's into).
Ok that was pretty damn funny!
I also sometimes wonder how some people have their jobs. They can hardly move their feet, let alone get things done. I must be so unlucky finding demanding jobs.
What's the girl's name?
And the right wonders why they lost the young vote.   Dumbdy dumb dumb.
nice Office Space reference lol
Make a video where the content maker licks and fondles Elon and acts mean and stereotypes people who lost their jobs at, say, Amazon!
Well, Silicon Valley will have a fresh bunch of "houseless" residents. I almost feel badly for them. Almost. Nah, not really even close to almost.
S pot on
I couldn't imagine having to work with retards like this. I'd be in prison so fast.
The people who work at Twitter are software engineers for the most part, they probably won't have too much issue finding work relative to most people.
I mean, there's no problem with this way of work. If your company is ok with it, more power to ya!!! There are sooo many people who ended their marriages in the 80s/90s as a 'sacrifice' to their jobs...broken homes galore lol
Great ending lol
Lol.... SO TRUE! LOLLOLLOLLOLLOLLOL 😂
because he is an evil billionaire  At least you got that part right, Besides the fact that he batshit.
Paid Ad of mollusk!
Meantime the person who made this video hasn`t apply for a real job yet we still point our fingers to Twitter employees to invent a platform for them to complain about it
I would like to apply for my face to be Mandy's seat.
I think you’ll find these people get very well-paying tech jobs at other companies.
I have a small business, a paint shop,  I opened in 2001. We do military parts for aircraft, submarines and everything in between. I've worked for companies where there was no radio allowed, no talking between employees, only phone calls allowed were for emergencies. You could make a phone call during 3 breaks, morning/afternoon or lunch. I used a temp agency for employees around 04/05 and 1 they sent me said this job is boring, you should have a TV, I had no response but please don't send William again. Most of my customers, machine and sheet metal shops have 1 or 2 major complaints. Endless hours on phone while working and no interest on how to be a better employee. They just don't care, like the person walking into the mall fountain on a phone or walking in front of a bus. I don't know what to say. Our children fight teachers when children around the world learn. Those children around the world want to come here to learn but our children do not want to learn. I'm sure a genius would say we are raising idiots who cry for everything.
Nice Office Space reference haha
For the people who left twitter thank god we don’t need you to sensor people you don’t like!
BYOG - bring your own guru, ha
I think what most of the people that enjoy this skit will miss is that a lot of these people who worked at twitter might not be manual laborers, but they work efficiently.  Everything they design is meant from a coder's perspective to be easy to do and easy to troubleshoot and easy to fix.  A lot of these people have talent that sets them apart.  All the Twitter perks are meant to attract talent.  There are are a lot more grease monkeys than coders cause coding is actually mentally harder to learn initially.   And the programmer hiring market is a lot more competitive as a result.  The thing you always have to realize about employment is that most bosses won't pay you a penny they don't have.  So, chances are, as much as you can make fun of the seemingly light workload or all of the perks..no boss would do that if those employees weren't worth 10x what they are being paid.
Good skit. Questionable acting.  6/10
Hilarious 😂
Dissing Twitter got a Like from me👍
This video is trash and Elon has no idea what real work is like, dude was born with a golden spoon up his ass.
I quit hiring people and have decided to just keep my staff at the current level due to people like her. They all wanted a paycheck, but didn't want to have to work for it.
I’ve never lost a job to downsizing. I have had to look for a new job in an owners market and it’s fucking depressing. You start from the bottom again. It sucks. You can make all the fun you want of these people. I sure wouldn’t trade places with them. Would you?
Seems to me that being cornholed was her real speciality.
"What would you say...ya did there?"  Perfect homage to Office Space lol
Any of those tools that expected the Twitter gravy train to last long enough to fund their entire lives to retirement is laughable. If your career is based on a trend you are taking a big chance. I remember going to do HVAC service at all these .com companies in the late 90's and early 2000's. These offices were decked out with all the new trendy desks, foosball, ,pool tables and coffee bars. Employees were riding around inside the building with these cool electric scooters. 2 or 3 years later I went back to do another service call and the place was emptied out. Only about 25% of the available office space was even being used. All that went to shit real quick. Kindof the same deal. Once the nesc for your biz becomes obsolete or replaced by the next latest and greatest thing you are left swinging in the wind. Programmers should not have an issue finding work but these company-specific create-a-job titles that serve no real use except making a space for something for you to do will be the first to be out the door. Those people will have the hardest time, especially if they went strait there out of college and have no other skills. Time for a reality slap.....boom.
Too bad, you can't address the issue directly and instead make shit up that you try to make funny, but fail. My guess is, you work less than they did and I consider them lazy.
Oh, my God! that is so funny!!
This is almost funny if it wasn't so real.
He said Miss, how dare you assume her gender, especially using while black hand.
This is priceless. LOL!!!
This is a gem.
I had my first "Real Job" at age 16. Twitter before Musks takeover is a literal dream job. Sit around, do very minimal work with plenty of toys and benefits 😂
The "college is for debt and lib art degrees"  crowd forgets that musk had $100,000 in college debt getting educated...seemed to work out for him as he's now the richest person on earth.
I am offended!!!!!
Who would hire a twit
💪🏻😂💪🏻😂🔝
1:05. Office Space throwback.
Job job. 🤣🤣
So funny and so much rings true
up until now twitter employees were some of the laziest people out there.. working just 4hr/week.. like WTF?.. even politicians (who are arguably some of the laziest people) don't work 4hr/week.. and now that Elon wants them to stick to a schedule and do some actual work.. they resign and weirdly its the women that are
Sam hyde already made this sketch ages ago
Man this is cringe to be considered comedy.
every job has idiots like this, and if Babylon Bee tries to claim they don't, they are f**king liars! pretty distasteful skit and the comments of your community,, f**k me, you people are twisted c**ts ,,!,,
You sure she wasn't a Council worker ?
This would be funny if it wasn't so true.
Yeah, soon there will be no Twitter. Elon Musk decided to kick important people and now begging them to come back.
Lmao, i thought of this the other day. Genius.
fucking conservatives wouldnt know comedy if it shot them in the face while hunting
,🌹
Learn to code
Lol, the actress has the perfect demeanor and look of many "hands off" management personnel today.  Have one named Karen in my department just like that, albeit not as extreme, but still.
Babylon bee just doesnt have the acting and writing old onion did
Good! Spoiled employees!
People seems to forget that people who were fired,  must certainly  have good credentials or good experience. I mean, it's not  easy to get an interview let alone gettign an offer from Twitter.
“Cornhole” is a very different verb in various parts of the country. That ending is twice as funny where I come from. 🤣
Paid by Musk? Ofc...
🤣🤣🤣brilliant,now I know why my account got closed
Try McDonald's
Lol funny, but really this doesn't represent anything like the years of hard work and study that goes into being a leading software developer.  But the " automotive mechanic" from a previous generation having his chance to lord over a younger and more relevant skill equipped generation I am sure is appealing to a base if you want views.  Seemed pretty on the nose though.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and call this 100% accurate.
F to the 4.2k twitter employees who disliked this video, truth hurts sometimes
Great sketch. Work is work. Stop catering to these fools who think it should be a walk in the park. They are a minority. Corporates need to do what they always have done. The flakes will have to work and will adjust to the real norms. I'm a millennial and I work hard and play hard after.
Clearly "paid for" by Elon PR flaks... but mark my words, it's going to cost a lot more to stem the tide of damage done by Dr. Space Ego. Well outside his level of competence now.
A great man once said "The world needs ditch diggers to" good to see documentary's like this showing how it really is.
All true 🤣
After working at Amazon I've decided that all the people complaining about working there have never had to do any real work in their lives. It's piss easy.
I'm sorry you lost your job, however  Ellon musk has done such amazing things in the end he will sort twitter out
This was really funny .. until the ending. Ruined it for me.
Sad but True!
Gunstore salesperson? Nothing triggering going on there. Excuse the gun pun.
Maybe they can go work for Disney
What a useless group of people. Good luck finding themselves at their next job.
Probably suprisingly accurate.
Imagine shilling for billionaires. The right is still incapable of satire.
I would put all of them in prison, crime? Liberalism, a cancer
it wont let me reply to the pinned comment sooo mortician, butcher, farm hand, septic service
This is NOT just for" twits".. ❤️👍👍👍👍👍
Is this supposed to be funny? It's so petty, lol. You guys insecure about something?
Wow, people sure do love hating on a service like Twitter they used _for free_
The real world is waiting to eat these people, alive. I'll bring the popcorn 🍿
Stress-free upbringing results. People are surprised that this kind of people and woke morons exist- evil people new how to social engineer to destroy new generations!
This isn't satire, this is just your average Twitter employee pre-Elon.
Good thing Musk fired these people..they block and suspend the account of the users who says something that didn’t fit in there own  narrative
Cute. People that work in tech are some of the smartest, most hard working people in America. Easy to make fun of someones profession when you don't know what they actually do.
🤣🤣🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤡🤡👍👍
Elon the lefty slayer!
Cornhole is a game? I didn't know that, but "Rooftop cornhole sess" clearly didn't mean what I thought of when I heard it.
Cleaning toilets would be a good career move for these people.
This is really not that far from reality when it comes to engaging with woke little leftists.
All I can see a profound ignorance about what an IT employee do in a place like Twitter - I once interviewed there.
Shut down youtube and put every lazy, non-working streamer out of business, especially this one.
Never heard of Babylon Bee before, but if they've been banned from Twitter I feel they're my kind of people.
Those fired Twitter employees should learn to mine coal. Anyone can do that, right? ;)
Women shouldn't be working.
Cornhole...what does that mean here?
Twitter who gives a shit if they lost there job. I've lost jobs loads a times and no politician ever spoke out on  my behalf
I feel sorry for the young people getting let go from the tech roles. It’s a shock to the system as everything has probably gone to plan up to now. I think they will get through these difficulties and it will work out for them.
That's more realistic than you know.
Haha! Rooftop cornhole sesh I got the mimosas!
@0:49 😂
When you read the job application and get to the bit about " what I have been doing for the last 6 months " it states I worked for Twitter as a ... That's the point you screw up the application and throw it in the trash can.
Elon I know you are here in the comments section you’re not slick 😅
I think that ex-Twitter employees will have a lot easier time finding a new job than ex-FTX employees.
Too soon? Haha. Savage.
LMFAO This is so true of Twitter employees, hope they like the unemployment line cause they will never be able to work again lolol, perfect video, gonna forward to my um...facebook (again LMFAO)
I have met lots of baby boomers like this!   They show up to the "office" early (6am) to get away from their kids and spouses.  They then eat breakfast there and then bullshit all day in the break room or hallways talking about some politician or a TV show.   They invite themselves to useless meetings ALL DAY to give everyone the impression that they work.   The only thing they do consistently is punch a clock.   The LAZY boomer knows that by being seen and heard he will trick other boomers into thinking they "work."  It's all about "being on time" to their all day bullshit session for the boomers!   And you guys are surprised their grand kids are just as bad as them?
Its a Fiasco over there
This would be funny if it wasn't true.
love rooftop mimosa sessions! sometimes clients even have a pool we can jump in XD
You guys really need to start taking liberal arts seriously... I know it's a field of fuckin' idiots and pussies, but they know how to make entertainment that is objectively entertaining.  This shit is only entertaining if you are already down a rabbit hole...
Laaaame!
What a lazy click-bait title "Applies for first real job", likely they were writing software code. That takes immense thinking, real brainpower and much more effort than your 1 second thought "real job" implies. Hey, to be a writer nowadays only requires one thing "fingers" to type. Thinking not required.
A BIG THANK YOU To Mr. Elon Musk!! GO WOKE GO BROKE!!! IT’S That Simple…
God bless Elon Musk!  Now I’m thinking about joining Twitter!
It must be hard for people at Twitter who lost their jobs to get real jobs now.
There's satire, and then there's propaganda. This feels more like propaganda.
🤣🤪😜🤣
Had a new guy join my company last week. Job involved inventory takes, picking stock for customers etc. Quit after 20 minutes!
Don't ever think the staff of YouTube and Google are any different. They're all pussies and could never do real work.
"What would you say...ya did there? lolpllololololol
The swamp cleaning itself, we are witnessing a historical moment.
"will you pay for my lunch too???!!" Reeeeee
I want to thank Elon Musk for creating a little bit of hell at Twitter before he can transform it back into heaven. And to prove that he is giving all the love he can, he has brought back The Dick's account. Don't you feel grateful? I can't wait to see hell on earth again.
Lol all these salty youtube comments are hilarious.
Ya, Conservative trailer trash will teach us what Software Engineers are worth. Free speech my ass, cuntservatives are the most foolish people on earth. Only thing Elon cares about is money and his ego. He'll sell you to the highest bidder right when he sees an opportunity.
“…or is it a BYOG situation..?” 😂💀
100% of the people in this comments section are not qualified to work at Twitter.
I think these people would make fine electricians in a factory. As an electrician we try to do as little work as possible and we never use a broom. They'll fit right in with our bunch. At least until they have had to replace an 80 lb servo motor or run a 100 ft cable, or something worse.
What they do at a twitter office is literally how anyone becomes a millionaire, on the computer taking phone calls filling out papers etc, yeah its not "real work" you think jeff bezos ever had to lift anything heavy to get amazon going??? Absolutely not. I have first hand knowledge and id rather do concrete work for 5$ an hour again than sit in some office getting b1tched at all day .
twatter. where the dead get work
This probably isn't completely fair. But nonetheless I still think they are  assholes...  Sometimes when I'm being reasonable I just think some of them are just misguided
1:04 great Office Space reference.
How he avoids the evil "w"-word 😄
Funny video Now do a video of ivanka trump applying for a real job after her draft dodging bankrupt father lost the election
Probably not a popular opinion, but all jokes aside, if Twitter employees were so useless why did Elon Musk pay 44 billion to acquire it. Also in the years I have been using Twitter, the only time it ever stopped working was after he took over, although it was only for  short while, but my trending suggestions are still messed up. But this right wing fantasy sketch is great too though I guess. 👍
What is a "mamosa"? Is it someone from a country called "mamosa". Are they refugees from a non-safe space government where people can say things without being banned or is it a band called "Re Fuge Ees"?
I suppose that work on The Babylon Bee is very hard and demanding. You know how dangerous is today to spread conservative sh... I, mean, philosophy?
Well, SpaceX is hiring!
How many Rubles did Putin pay you Traitors this month?
Millennials!
loved it so much, made my day
Awesome!
i bet she was corn holing!!!
Where's the memes for all the Twitter employees that quit en masse while expecting to be immediately picked up by Facebook and Amazon, only to find out that Facebook and Amazon were laying off en masse??
Babylon bee is becoming what The Onion's Youtube channel used to be, and  I love it.
Elon the great saviour of free speech who fires everybody straight away who dares not to agree with him ! Could there even be more irony than this ?
Lol great work.
Let's clean out the rest of silicon valley next.
You mean I have to work all 8 hrs?
LMAO...,  These self entitled people will run the country into ground.  When you hire 10 of young generation worker, only one is good and does all 10 persons work by this one person.  Rest are always looking to cheat/goof off.  99% of time on there phone.  They just don't want to work.
Great I have a business to sell at a discount price of 21 billion. I love you Elon!
1:04-1:08 Love the Office Space reference
Probably not far from the truth.
Funny..good attempt :-) From twitter post: The average #twitter employee pre-acquisition by  @elonmusk  worked 15 minutes a day, earning an average $146,000 a year salary (the bottom 10% earned avg $109,000/yr). To get a single 8 man-hour day, every work day, you therefore need 32 employees, which cost $4.8M annually.
reality bites!
I got a job for all hot Twatter alumni, right here in my basement baby!
Love the mre in the background
Spot on
1:35 cornhole? like anal? wtf lol
Sounds like Twitter really needed Elon to buy the company otherwise they would all lose their jobs due to bankruptcy. Sounds like Twitter was doing what FTX was doing, nothing.
I have no interest in Twitter and think musky is just…blergh.  Yet the skit resonated with me…and I secretly wondered if this person, a thousand times over…compiled the “workforce” at Twitter, before the cut. Just sayin’……
The sodomy ending was gross.
What a load of garbage! Jack Dorsey is fixing to launch a hostel buyout of TruthSocial and take the entire Twitter subscriber nation with him! All of those quitting Elon Musk's failing sick bird will have a home in Dorsey's new TS!
elon saving humanity
😂😂😂
I work at a burger king fast food resturaunt had new employee start about a week into it (started at 11.00) and then a week later demanded  a pay raise to 13 an hr and was like pay raise or leave and my gm was like by... What buisness what give u a raise only a week in the job? Kid was dillusional
"what would ya say...... ya did there?!"  Great reference to Office Space! Love it.
I hear McDonald’s is hiring;)
I just find it funny that all twitter  aka "jobs" are not real jobs no real life skills b/e 90% ould not be able to handle it
The people that made this video have no idea how the such companies work. The  backbone of those companies are people that maintain the servers and update the code. Those people work long hours and it requires knowledge that few possess. Without them the company will fall apart and replacing them is borderline impossible because it could take months or even years to thoroughly understand the code they wrote.  Oh and if you think you can replace them, come on go and apply for one of their positions with their high salaries. Shouldn't be too hard right? People need to stop watching those  "day in a life of X software engineer" videos.
I would like to thank Elon for firing all of those free loading, basement dwellers. Maybe now the little libtards can go find a real job.
Lazy comedy
morgan a dude btw
What should she seek next? I'd say something on her back...
The grease - reminds me of greased lightning woketard slacker employees being removed from twitter.
🤣🤣🤣
7500 employees to run a website that doesn't even ship goods is ridiculous.  You don't need 7500 people to troubleshoot network issues and cyber security.  Good job on Elon for trimming the fat.
Love this!!!!
Typical democrat
It must be sad to be a member of that generation and have to live with the fact that that is the way normal people view you.
Their new jobs will be to stuff ballot boxes.
Pretty accurate because she didn't even think she was the one in the wrong once
I love the Office Space reference! "What would ya say... ya did there?" lmao
"Amy" millennial interview much better. However, this is more apropos.
Lmao, that ending was golden
Haha this felt so good to watch xD Well made! Thanks <3
Unless you are paid 5-9 dollars above minimum wage for a specific job that requires little work, you should not perform above and beyond. Minimum wage earns minimum effort, and earning a dollar or 2 raise after 2 years or 3 years of effort is not sufficient. However, most business schools attempt to train new managers to manipulate their workforce so they feel they are contributing to the company and they are valued employees. Which is not proven as their wages start at the lowest rate allowed and is increased at even lower rate. The work should reflect that expectation of wage.   Remember we live in a racist, colonial white created society that manipulates economics and law for their sole benefit. You can understand this when you educate yourself on Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous law. The white race is a pathetic group who attempt to control all aspects of your lives.
If you worked for twitter and got terminated that makes you a twit.
Twitter employees going right into manufacturing
This is so true…I have so many colleagues that doesn’t do shit at work and get paid shit load of money. The owner of businesses should step up and stop spoiling these people.
I wonder if this guy voted for President Trump, or if he was endlessly nagged into the other way by his family ?
Is “Software Engineer” not considered a “real job”?
nobody cares
Almost spit my food out!!!!!!🤣
BRILLIANT. simply brilliant. I love it. :-)
she just needs learn to code.
She Lauren Conraded out of that office
What the hell is twitter anyway? I have managed to live almost 70 years without feeling I have to use it for anything so what is it? Anyway looks like Mandy is on the right track getting a real job, good luck Mandy
This isn't a spoof! This is actually how it was there!! lol
THERAPY! she needs a therapist STAT
Love these guys. Always funny.
How to deal with these woke idiots:  1. Round them up and revoke their citizenship. 2. Give them all $50 each. 3. Drop them in the water about 100 feet away from the coastline of Somalia. 4. Let nature take its course.
Funny, First real Job 😂
Sound right, I'm so happy to see all those lazy weak victim mentality Communists out of a job.
Mannn this was funny
Elon what a guy get these people back into the real world cleaning people's Tesla's
imagine thinking like this? y’all are self righteous pieces of trash. i bet half of y’all are lazy ass pos at work.
why is everyone so interested in a hole full of corn
Elon should be ashamed. Firing all those people and leaving them to fend for themselves in the real world. They'll starve unless they come to California where they'll be fed for eternity while doing nothing...just like Twitter in pre-Musk.
Hardcore gewgull censorship here
Anyone else get the Office Space reference??
Youtube blocks our humour comment!  Fu cough!
Twitter has done so well since Elon took over!  Can't stop winning
This is comedy but the truth is still there. This generation that doesn't feel they should work will hurt the economy ten fold in the next twenty years. The mentality of kids these days is "someone else worked hard so we can play."
You realize these people were mostly engineers/etc. right?
Did you miss the part where most people quit?  Idiot.
You had this pre recorded the second you got banned and heard elon was buying the platform.
Now THIS is quality content! 😂❤ New sub! 🐾🐿🇨🇦 CFC66
Brilliant.
Love this.
Lol. This is gold.
This accurately describes anyone of the current generation entering or already in the workforce. I used to be a boss, somehow I've become an adult babysitter.
I paint houses! I love my job!! Climbing ladders in 100 degree summer heat, 10 hr days, then I go home & it's straight to cooking dinner for my son, the rest of the time I'm bidding jobs & doing paperwork. . .Sundays I spend hanging out, bonding witn my kid. . .I couldn't imagine living like these guys! I don't even consider what I do to be all that hard, but if I'm not getting new calluses every day, I don't think I'm doing enough! Lol
This looks like a right wing hate video to me
is corn hole mean your corn hole being ram rod
LOL I got suspended twice last year by twitter🤣after commenting on CA governor's tweet
Finally the service areas will no longer have work shortages
Kinda had this problem during an oil boom.A northern electrician thought we would bring the pumpjack to him.he'd never worked outside before.
Right wingers are against anybody who gets an easier job. If you don't retire needing knee replacements they believe you haven't done your part for the corporations that they adore. Why would anybody be against working for a place that values their workers?
I mean I feel this. But if I walked I to the boss's office and he had an MRE on his desk like that was his lunch I'ma walk out
Elon needs to get rid of the activists at Twitter.
loved it !
This is true.
Thousands of software engineers and IT techs were laid off uprooting their lives and families, but lets all joke and pretend they were all like this weird fever dream conservatives have for lazy entitled youths. Go watch "the horrors of being a Facebook moderator" to see what social media content mods actually do, spoiler alert it isn't muting your favorite political cry babies tweets.
Until Elon, reinstates Alex Jones, to me this is still not a platform for free speech. Jones didn't say anything that encouraged violence. He called a bad reporter, a bad name. But Elon won't let him on because of Sandy Hook. That's a personal issue for Elon. But he is definitely headed in the right direction. Got to remember Elon is a liberal Democrat. So this must be very hard for him. People calling Elon a right winger now or just out of their minds. Elon is a liberal Democrat.
Sounds about right ...
You know the sad part this is true to life!!!!  Never every trust a democrat... FACT
She reminds me of my sons “current” girlfriend. Clueless, AND triggered by her OWN shadow!
That's just too damn funny. And Twitter had the balls to band The Babylon bee? Over a guy, dressed in a dress. Wearing a ridiculous admiral's hat. The joke is him.
strawman humor........simpleton's low hanging fruit
Hahahahahahaha this was so good. Unfortunately, the Twitter people getting fired and quitting because of some billionaire who thinks he knows all, will probably have a hard holiday season. I hope a new platform rises to replace Twitter and musk loses on his purchase.
But they have to write code, not write horrible comedy. It's far better paid than what you comedy rejects get paid, and much more highly skilled.
This is probably not all that far from the thruth.
This is a skit, but the sad thing is you know Twitter had people like this working there. REAL people that think and act like this.
"And then Baam!" 😄
1:05 - Loved the "Office Space" reference!  :)
Bunch of fucking emotionally ignorant fucking retards is what they are this whole woke agenda is bullshit people need to learn to control their fucking emotions be good sports and if they lose accept it you don't have to like it but quit acting like a bunch of fucking babies.
Work is a dealbreaker 😂😳🤪
Bad acting
Reminder to the middle class people, unrealistic videos like this are not realistic to life. Elon is an evil a whole who has a cult following that have not updated their views on him.
Gonna be a lot of unemployed Dungeon Masters out there.  Expect a massive jump in D&D Twitch streams.  😁
WOw just Wow. 5mins in and I'm still not laughing. Corny AF.
Twitter isn't the only company firing tech developers lmao.. it's Lyft and many others they are telling their jobs people. Saying we don't need this many lazy people in the tech gig world now. We can manage a few now and strive with less while hammering it out. Oh well back to your seeking jobs go find a real job lol
NEXT !
Babylon Bee's twitter division has to go back to work again! Those slackers have been drinking mimosas all day for months.
I like the Office Space reference,  "so, what did you do?"
nice
Why the 4k dislikes
twitter employee?  Modern day woman...
the sad result is that most of those sickly-partisan-fact destroyers are now working for yahoo/google?cnn/msnbc/abc ect.ect totally destroying all hopes for Freedom of speech and opinion.  Partisan so called factcheckers are China's favorite agents and a true curse on America!
Mad props for the MRE on the boss's desk in the background. 🙌
I know this is meant to be funny and it is but this country is in serious trouble when the next world conflict happens.
Onlyfans, no judgement.
This is dumb
wow, making fun of the "Laptop Class" by using your Youtube channel.  Cringe levels of irony (its not a good look for you)
Fruitport Michigan? That’s where I’m from…poor Steve he was a nice guy
I'm permanently banned on Twitter. Their employees live solely to ban people from up high in their ivory tower. Seriously. I think I was arguing with a bunch of animal molester at the time and Twitter decided I was too problematic for their platform. It's strange though. In my normal life, everyone agrees with me, all the men at work agree with me, all the women I speak to agree with me. but if you say any of it on Twitter, suddenly you need to be outcast, disenfranchised, blocked from talking to people literally for the rest of your life. What a strange company indeed.
Isn't it obvious? She's perfect for YouTube!
That man has to be the coolest boss in the world for putting up with her for so long. Lol!
This might be closer to the reality than you think
That's funny - kind of unspoken how the left fears manual labor.
I'm sure with their qualifications they'll do fine at McDonald's or Burger King
That was the most unfunny YT clip I ever saw in my life. I bet every laid off twitter employee could write better jokes than you delivered in this clip.
Lets just be clear about one thing.. Anyone who doesn't like work from home for digital work is either a paranoid asshole or uses their job as a means to make gossip/socialize. I will die on this hill if it means I don't have to listen to janice tell me about her dumb husband or untrained dogs for another second.
Truly don’t get the punch line with anything in this video. Honest question, what facts line up with working at Twitter not being a real job and that they are incompetent workers?
Elon is the GOAT.
These folks are SO good at what they do. WAY better than the elite Hollywoods.
Extremely poorly done video. That old lady did not even react to the Engineering ring worn by the labourer.
whynwas the babolyn bee even banned?  pure genious comedy holding up a mirror so a certain perspective can see itself.
7000 people managing a bulletin board, I'd say this is pretty accurate.
This would be funny, but not so since it is true about virtually a whole generation (or two).
Do you have a cafeteria and it’s free right? LOL
Oh, I thought she would call it "Blackhand".
Jesus Christ, unemployed since 33 AD.  Dead, too.
fuck woke snowfalkes.
I wonder if any ex Twitter employee will actually admit that they worked there when asked in person? I really want to meet one in the wild.
101% spot on !!! you can't find anywhere in the world more worthless employees then ex-twitter stuff 😂
@ ps403547 What's a gas station attendant?  hahahha
"Take It Easy" - Annette
BYOG 😂😂😂
Good one. I first finished an apprenticeship in metal working and a few years of installing industrial machines before I figured I don't want to have the grease and dirt eaten into my skin for life. So I went back to school, did a mechanical engineering and a computer science degree and didn't have to have dirty hands anymore. Interestingly over the course of my life I think the apprenticeship was the most useful education I have because to this day I never needed to hire a mechanic or contractor and many things I did got better by simply knowing how it's done by hand - so I didn't engineer a part in a manner that the screw to fix it to something was inaccessible. Even helped with software design since looking at the work process first and then designing a software that helps with the process makes more sense than giving someone a software that doesn't address the workflow and needs.
I’m never going to not cringe when anyone decides it’s time to go “cornhole”.  😳  Really?
"oh this is a job-job" LOL kids these days......
All Babylon Bee employees probably all have liberal arts degrees, which is fine. But its hilarious that they can make a skit like this without any self awareness. Like they are at bunch of coleminers.
Oh, so this is a maga scum site
As a software engineer, I can tell you that none of those Twitter devs are working anything other than remote jobs.  The rest of the industry is remote.  It's amazing having flexible hours, working at the times that works best for your schedule, and working 10 feet from your bed.   More people should work to become devs instead of being mad at them for having these sort of luxuries.
lol sounds about right
The "What would you say you did there?" reference to "Office Space" was so, so perfect!
Rooftop corn hole with mimosas. Lol!
Oh, so this is like a "job-job". That might be a dealbreaker...LMAO...so great. This actress is hilarious.
In a related story The Babylon Bee is still living in their parents basement.
Yall be trying to hard to make fun of the left. This content seems like its for only boomers lol. Y’all are a lost cause
YouTubers making fun of twitter employees for not having a real job. Hard to laugh when both aren't "real" jobs.
very funny
omg... those people will be so roasted on the real job market.
LMAO
You know if these people were smart they’d take their income earnings & invest them so they wouldn’t have to work.m
Applied for real job? Like looking for a real number in a math problem.
Software companies were not built that way, but somehow became woke, not sure why.
😂😂😂 hahah awesome!
2:48 I thought her reaction was to the ring on his finger
So just to be clear the fired software engineers are the Morons? Not the entitled billionaire that spent 44 billion on twitter and the proceeded to lose so many advertisers than he has to take money from his other companies to buy adds on twitter. Then followed by the brilliant decision to offer the choice of working 12 plus hour days or a 3 month severance and then was surprised that most people took the buy out?
i lowkey relate to her lmao ><
The reason this isn't funny is because it comes from a spiteful, vengeful, hateful place.  Humor is never funny when it comes from there, no matter who it is, no matter what the topic is. It's obvious you're upset you got banned before and instead of acknowledging how insanely difficult it actually is to even LEARN what's needed for a career in any number of technical positions at twitter, you dismiss them as morons who have no ability to get anything done in life.  It's pretty pathetic, actually.  edit: Oh and LOL@ the question "what job should Mandy seek out". Writer at Babylon Bee would be a good fit given how unimaginative and dull she is.
this is hard to watch even as a joke
How about MSNBC?
The irony of the fact that nobody at babylon bee having worked a blue collar job a day in their lives is obviously lost on most of their audience
The real world has consequences……doesn’t it? 😂
Unfortunately accurate.
Great punchline, Babylon Bee makes me happy
That girl would probably replace that boss with an empty chair.  Between the two, that outdated boss is not needed.
Had to watch this 5 times, it's so funny and true. More  videos of Twitter please!!
Trouble is that is exactly what some people are like.
So, going from app dev, where start times are not important and exemption implies this sort of convo would be illegal, to working cleaning offices....  Do u get that twitter is a moron and those folks already have another job....  stupid neelon...  There is negative unemployment among those with ce degrees....  Stop pretending money us more valuable than knowledge.
Man, we might go extinct in three generations.
BB is a Godsend!
Conservatives are the easiest people on the planet to pander to
Well this is accurate
The best and funniest I seen so far. The best! Twitter employees are so entitled lol
This channel is ironic
"What would you say ya did there?" Nice Office Space referance.
Reminds me of a job interview I had in 1978 , I arrived nicely dressed , driving a white 1968 Cadillac Eldorado.   I saw this guy with coveralls tied around his waist  ,  covered in this RED mud and filthy .  He said " can I help you ? " I said " I'm looking for Colin Crawford "  .  He said " you're looking at him .  I instantly shook his hand  !   He said  " you want the job ? " I said " sure "  he replied  "  be here at 05:30 in the morning,   dont wear any good clothes !  The job was loading Fire Bombers with Fire - Trol 100  ( the glory days )
Starbucks!
Thanks for giving the useless entitled peons a taste of actually doing something... instead of going through the motions to pass thanks to the setup of academia turning getting a degree (which meant something) into just taking advantage of the idea of college being a place of knowledge and thought gained; now being a piece of paper that vouched for money being paid to say one/they had the official  opportunity to have gained knowledge.
Lol should do the opposite where blue collar employees don't know how to restart their phones/pc when it's acting slow.  Also the reason why all the techs have to ask "Did you try restarting your pc/phone?"
I saw the beginnings of this ‘culture’ over 20 years ago when I worked for a .com corp, I was late one day my first week because of construction and an accident, I was so nervous about getting in trouble and/or the bad impression it would make. I was over 1/2 hour late and no one said a word and my supervisor invited me to go to breakfast, spent over an hour having breakfast until finally actually going to work.
Her delivery of the excuse for being late is perfect. Mindless word salad that she doesn't even understand.
she's gorgeous
According  to Pelosi  we need crop pickers. Go place for ex Twitter 'ers
Yooooo the end had me dead 🤣😂   "I got the mimosas!"
I want 50 more of these
in the end did she almost puke because of the grease or because she called her "miss"?
Totally awesome.  Thanks for the laughs.  Bad thing is that is what our world is coming to.
First 'real' job? Let me guess, you're still upset Trump lost the election and you feel the need to lash out at 'lefties' however you can...  So weak.
This is where they develop ai to replace those jobs XD just wait on it
I think Twitter workers should be banned from office jobs.  They are sub-human!  Lol. Hey former Twitter employees.   MAGA!   Lol
Wow, I remember when Babylon Bee was a small channel with like 50k subs...
It is so real; I can’t laugh
I'm curious about Mandy's "afternoon corn hole sesh."
Lol a real job so they’re open late admitting that Twitter is trash and not a real job the Internet is for slave creatures
Love the Office Space reference. What would ya say ya do here?...
Has she tried onlyfans
Too bad this isn't that far from the truth...absolutely pitiful...
Now go get a Real Job and see how easy you all had it
That grease on the hands is really gross. Real jobs are gross. Thanks for the journalism babolyn bee.
Fact or fiction? Hmm...
glorious
Y'all are cucks. Sucking off the richest man in the world then pretending you're anti-establishment.  Just wait till he links your Twitter account to your bank account and that chip he puts in your brain.  You do know it's his goal to hook you directly into the internet, right? lol fuck outta here... Cheering for folks getting fired.... Buncha cucks, thinkin all this internet stuff is magic and just appears at your fingertips. Typical right wing assclowns. Probably afraid to send your kids to college cause u been reading about  "woke" on the magical interbox.
She did a good job.
Whilst the satirical quality of this content is epic, it’s depressing that this type of person is truly representative of certain members of society. Those will be the downfall of human civilisation.
Hahahaha!
Cringe content
Parts of me understands quitting, but also, you quit your job because you don't like your boss? lol. Okay.
Shouldn't it be wokeforce.
If you don't like the job (get stuff done) then maybe you had better take a spoonful of concrete and harden up.
LOL. Nailed it, Babylon Bee!
ahahhahahahahahahahahahah
Any company that functions fine on half the employees was rolling in money! Tear the house down Elon!
Exactly the stupid attempt at humor I have come to expect from the Babylon Bee. The Onion has nothing to worry about from whoever writes this shit. Conservatives just can't do humor. It is beyond you.
Love you guys FOREVER!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Such people are not fit to be rehired anywhere... Even as naughty film extras 😃.  This is the product of today's privileged woke culture.  Btw the actors were fantastic.
Attention all you unemployed Twitter people enjoy fast food and Retail maybe that job you can handle clearly you couldn't handle the other job
This goes out to everyone else in this world who also acts likes the fired Twitter staff.....wake the fuck up you lazy ass people in this world.  WORK is WORK. If YOU want to be NOTHING then you deserve NOTHING. NOW DIE AND QUIT WASTING MY FUCKING MONEY
Babylon Bee jokes are like 2010 anti SJW jokes that boomers use. I should change my career to    a Babylon bee script writer. “Omg I’m so triggered” and there’s the joke lol. The righties gonna eat it up every time 😂 I’d be making millions
It's funny that people who make right wing boomer "comedy" for a living want to talk about real jobs
She should first made to throw cases of Pepsi in glass bottles onto a conveyor belt all day without a break . Then sort bottles for washing, while standing in 4 inches of Pepsi. Then work as a cashier at 7-11….and get robbed. Then install exhaust, shocks and brakes on cars, in the winter, with ice and snow drizzling all down your back, your hair constantly on fire, and every shirt you own with holes burnt in them , for 10 hours a day. All the above for $3.50 an hour. Then, cut and grind  glass and mirror in closed shop in the desert, in the summer, and come home soaked to your socks in sweat.with glass in every orifice. All the while her lazy do nothing spouse, divorces her, takes the kids, all she has ever worked for, and the judge takes 70% of her pay. Leaving her to live in a $200 a month apartment. If she can do that….. Then you can give her a break, and give her a business, where you finally make a decent wage, can afford a HUD house, and can work until she dies. No retirement of course.
Work? They don't even know why are breathing in this World.
Ha. I'm in the IT field.  Since graduation from college. I've never had to look for a job. They always find me. I doubt any of these IT professionals, that quit Twitter, will not find it very difficult to find other employment.
she needs to apply for a job at one of the schools that produced her.
Did he just missgender her, i mean it?
I got the Office Space reference!
She sounds like Joe "BLOW BOY" Biden!
They all think they are it because they can use a keyboard but if they don't understand what they are doing then it's all irrelevant .
The Twitter Woketards will never survive in the real World, be great fun to watch them crash and burn😂
that guy was definitely channelling his inner "bobs" from the movie office space
welcome back to twitter lads
Nice strawmanning! You guys really suck at comedy.
my god that intro is obnoxious.
Well done Elon!!
You're being manipulated into thinking tech is an easy, lazy life. It ain't. Yes there are insane perks but there are also insane work hours. If you think this is in any way a real real life in tech you should come to my tech interviews. We demand excellence. Deep knowledge of systems and industry. Broad experience. Technical acumen. It is extremely cutthroat. We only want the best. And then we pay you super well and give you great perks to stay. At least at the best companies I've worked at over the last 25 years in industry.
You're just jealous some people have "fancy" jobs where they don't use "hand tools" 🙂 You realize your favorite platform, YouTube, also has Content moderation, Copyright, and other monitoring tools?
Welcome to the real world
Not Satire... at all! LOL
I admire the actress for her acting skills, but Jesus H Christ I want to punch that character in the face.
Love it
WTF? I thought this was supposed to be funny!
“What did. you do. there?”
😂👋👋👋👋
Gas station attendants only exist in Jersey!
Sanitation worker or as we used to say without offense,   Garbage Man.   That was back when as kids we would wave to them and they would wave back.
Awwww can't find a job we're you don't have to work lol 🤣
Three reasons you get hired 1.) They are desperate to replace someone  2.) They know someone who knows you 3.) They want to have sex with you
As much I like Elon taking over Twitter, asking everyone to be onsite is just lame and won’t scale. He may not want that anyways but I can tell you any software company that will only allow on-site and don’t provide flexibility of remote won’t scale much. Right now, macro economics will help, but just wait for a year or so once things improve and we will see the churn.  Btw, I am all in for restructuring as there is always lot of dead wood & diversity hires at these places who should not gotten the job in the first place.
I'd be amazed, Twitter had some really, really skilled staff.
Propaganda from american party using twitter with GM money for this garbage employees elon musk is the remedy twitter will be the greatest social media
Thanks for me lol hard 🙏🙏🙏
"Bring Your Own Guru" Hahahahaha
When the dude had grease on his hand, I thought she was going to accuse him of practicing blackface...
Her frying voice really matches the character. "They" all speak like that, disgusting
only fans is going to explode with new "talent" curtesy of twitter!
Biden ILLEGALLY funnels OUR TAX MONEY to these companies to silence anyone that would expose them.   THAT is the job they provide.
Ah Babylon Bee, showing their true garbage standards of not having the slightest clue. Please go back to obscurity where you belong.
Awesome!!! Just loved it.
LOL so true. Good riddance to the Twitter riff-raff.
This is not comedy it's truth, great stuff keep up the good work.
I think I'ver seen everything I'd like to see. The burning question the people who made this video had. what does a Twitter employee do? They never got an answer so instead, hey, let's just make fun of the generation who handed us our own asses in the latest mid-term elections. Oh yeah, and let's remove any doubt right wingers can't write comedy and we think hitting things is funny. Do you think you can still get the deposit back on the video equiptment?
Aw, damn this is probably too damn close to the truth to be parody 🤣😂🤣
What is this? Sponsored by the stink of Musk?
This is probably not far from the actual truth. Great video!
Disclaimer: video by a braindead Elon Musk fan
I know exactly what B.Y.O.G. is supposed to mean.
Mandy? I'm surprised she hasn't changed her name to Womandy.
This is crap.
I cant work at Twitter because id miss having pretty nails and greasy hands XD give this girl a wrench instead of a computer any day of the week. A desk job sounds miserable. Even with my fucked up back.
Brilliant !☺️👌
its amazing that all the leftist fascists are freaking out that Twitter will actually allow points of views other than there woke BS.......on second thought its not all that amazing,
This is how tech companies entice employees nowadays... with fun perks like lunch provided on site and free gym memberships. I am more likely to take a job that offers those perks and I don't think there's any shame in having a fun work environment. Twitter is one of many tech companies to do this. It's not a liberal thing. It's a tech thing where there's a lot of demand for people with unique skills. They have significant budgets that go into recruitment because of how in-demand some of these employees are. A full-stack developer can basically demand any salary. And when they can do that, they'll be looking for additional perks to put them over the top. It doesn't make them liberal, it makes them highly skilled and in-demand.
All you jealous slags crying about twitter staff having better lives is sad as fuck. 😂😂😂😂
Why do boomers think this shit is funny
Very funny :D
All the other technology companies are watching what elon did at Twitter with all the layoffs. They will soon follow suit. The free money stimulus b.s. is over folks. There will be  many layoffs in 2023.
She's such a talented actor.
2:45 Blackface performer. Caught and banned!
The World's ending
Fuck the left leaning tards who worked at twitter
this is so close to reality it's not even parody
Wow this must be done by a republican wingnut. These billionaires really have unlimited funds to cover their price gouging of regular people.
Loy satee please!
sad thing is a lot are like this for real and will never find a real job
Pretty much every fired Twitter employee in a nutshell.
🤣🤣🤣 it's gonna be tough out there.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! This is brilliant!
Yup ! When a White collar starts looking for a blur collar job😂 !! Now it's Twitter, next who ??😂
"cornhole"? What is that?
In the scene with the grease on the hands I expected her to accuse the mechanic of "blackfacing" - I mean "blackhanding".
twitter refugees flooding youtube right now
Right wing mental illness I see.
OMG This is so hilarious!  So much truth in it, it's really scary what this country's future holds.
Wow right wings really are completely out of touch. Its actually true that there are no funny right wing comedians.
It's not a parody, most of female co-workers are like that, entitled princesses who spend more time chatting than doing anything productive...
If you see a resume with Twitter on there, simply say Thanks, Next..  at least its not that triggering.
0:14 you're late >> her smile as a first answer is priceless
Get a useless college degree than blame capitalism for not having a job
She's playin her role very convincing.  Millenials an Gen Z ... 🤢
A lot of Musk-cultists, I mean good folks, in the comments section don't realize this is a parody.
When they go for exaggeration to make a point but likely the real thing was even worst.
It's not parody anymore, it's a documentary.
Onlyfans about to get more female content creators 😂
Damn this is lame
Dislike this idiot
Ur just a YouTube wanker by the way talking shit
I know this was trying to be dramatic however it was extremely accurate 🤣
Not too close from the truth when it comes to these people
Does " real work " mean making videos like that?
Crash dummy would be a good fit for her.
Elon should buy onlyfans next
Poor old Elon. Bit more difficult in the EU and UK where people are protected from predators. He's not been able to do what he has done in the US. That and commenst just shows what Americans think of Americans.
This blown up like a volcano. Glad
Actually Elon sponsored this video.
Pinned by a sniper
Y'all get a comment and like just for the "...on the fritz" line.
Ok that was hilarious! Hahahha
People are overreacting. People gets fired all the time and zero notice. Get used to it.
Next will be YouTube. Google after that probably. I think a lot of people don’t know where to go.
Would’ve thought she would’ve said start times are a social construct.
Employee can't hit dislike anymore, thanks google
Ha.   I live in Fruiport township
Awesome video, well done Babylon Tree! And thank you Musk :)
Send them down a coal mine 🤔 it's easy right!!!! You mine it and people get to turn their lights on at night 😁 yucky coal 😜
BYOG 😂😂😂
when you do a skit and dont know anything about coding. and think people at twitter were just fools. these people could smoke your youtube channel :) should make a skit about working for babylon bee. come up with dumb ideas and post them online :) sounds like engineering level stuff. XD
Lol this channel doesnt know how a software company works. This video is kinda bad
I own a small business.  We schedule roughly 40-ish interviews a week.  Of those, maybe 10 will actually even show up.  Of those, maybe 4 of them will actually be on time.  Of the ones on time, we will hire about 2 (obviously implying we don't hire the ones not on time).  Of the two we hire, only one will last longer than 3 weeks.  So yes, of those 40 interviews scheduled, we will get about 1 hire that actually lasts and is decent at the job.  Generally younger people apply for this job (those in their 20's and 30's).  It's not just people working at Twitter or other tech companies that are like this actress, it truly is just young people in general these days.  Work ethic is essentially non-existant in you younger generations (millenial/gen Zs).  We see eerily similar entitlement to this actress in so many of the candidates we interview, particularly the ones that are late.  Not to say there aren't good, hard working young people out there, but from personal experience I can tell you it is most definitely the exception, and not the norm.  If I didn't see this for myself day in and day out I would say it's just some blanket generalization that younger people these days are lazy, but I do see it and it's not a stereotype - it's the absolute truth.
Holy shite, there’s a ton of hate here. Maybe I’m not on social media enough, but I’m beginning to understand where the divisiveness comes from. Is this really what people think tech companies’ employees are like?
I can smell the blue collar seethe. No one from twitter is going to have problems finding work, especially not devs, and none of them are going to apply to factories. Get real.
The engineers will find work in no time. Apparently the folks that stayed are mostly on visas.
😂😂😂
Twitter has a really talented set of people
This is so dumb and not funny
Security guard here.🙋‍♂️ I love to come to my workplace. It's peaceful i work alone. I am guarding a factory that is working only 2 months in a year. The factory is producing tomato concentrate from fresh tomatoes. And I'm guarding the machines and all the product. It's a small factory with 2 meter walls and security cameras all around in a very safe EU country.  My only concern is not to be late. I have in my office a PC with free internet, Tv, radio, air conditioning. And a foldable bed. My wage is 20% higher then the minimum wage in my country. This job is better then all other how do i say (shity) minimum wage jobs where i would actually needed to do manual work. I'm coming to my work to relax and listen music, watch YouTube, movies, series, read,.... The only negative side is all that sometimes gets boring and it's not a high paying job. But then i remember what shity jobs that i have worked for even less money and I'm happy for now. I live in a small town where there aren't much of opportunities to find a better job. I'm actually at work now and have so much free time at my hands.😉
HAha this is golden!
Funny, that's exactly how I imagine a twitter employee.
Funny how in reality most of those Twitter employees were hired by other tech companies and some are even self employing themselves. The uneducated imbecile rightards that try to make fun of them are poorer and in worst conditions than the Twitter employees they criticize and that's hillarious xD
sooo many people i know all over the world is like that
jolly good sir.
The end was fantastic 😆
McDonalds would like to send it's regard for Elon Musk
Everyone should watch this 😂😂☠️
Youtuber making a video about a twitterer who does not want to take a factory job... Irony
Meant to be comedic, yet is in fact accurate.
all of the people involved in censorship    were basicsly getting oaid ridiculous money for a job that took less work than anything on planet... they r likely to be unemployed the rest of their lives.... no one will risk hiring them
Thank you Elon
Ummm...  She said she'd have an afternoon cornhole session...  Uh...  🧐 Never heard of that but...  OK.  Good times.
Was thinking the ring was what set off.  Oh no, traditional monogamous values!
LOL. I think the whole deal about Elon Musk taking over Twitter is hilarious. These ex air head snowflakes are going to have a reality check.
We the people!🇺🇸
What a stupid, unfunny sketch. Pretty much sums up anything from these clowns
- "So, how do you get any work done?"   - "Eww, work"
This is not funny. Because it's real.
What would you say... you do here?
I'd never hire an ex Twitter employee. That's way to much baggage to unpack.
That was funny as shit and 100% TRUE - What a waste of resources and almost work force time.  🤣
I thought the grease on theirs hands was going to be " black hand." Some sort of racist accusations or something. Well done.
Thank you Elon for destroying Twitter.  Next, buy Facebook and destroy that and fire everyone too
i dont get it ?
This is what happens when everyone gets a ribbon....
I know this is satire But I get a feeling this isn't that much different from what is actually happening to these job interviews of ex-Twitter people
Is this right wing comedy? Y'all find this funny?
This is how younger generation is. They want a desk job in an AC room and a nice premium pay check.
40 seconds in, and the cringe is too real. Whether you like it or not, opinions are a commodity, and yours' are garbage. Musk is finding that out the hard way. Brands don't want to display their ads alongside pathological liars, especially not when every lie is dripping with authoritarian and bigotted intent. Musk is failing because he drank the kool aid. He actually thought MAGA was being kicked off soap boxes because of some left-wing "wokeness" or "cancel culture". It wasn't; it was capitalism. Turns out the free market doesn't place much value on delusional conspiracy theorists trying to usher in a christo-fascist dystopia just to "own the libs".   Oh, and these Twitter employees are being scooped up with a quickness. That Biden unemployment rate, just 2 years after the (2nd) Trump recession, is incredible.
I noticed a John McGinley Office Space moment.
Ex CEO should sell onions now that's what marwadis do in India.
Please make this a mini series for various normal jobs
What job should Mandy seek out next? Handling drilling rig equipment in Siberia in the middle of an Arctic snow storm! And be armed and be surrounded by dogs against being eaten by polar bears.
So cool
When the guy showed his hand with all the grease on it while saving "five minutes", and that zoom in happened, I thought they'd subvert my expectations by being triggered over the wedding ring, a marker of patriarchal institution intended to control women and exploring their fully polyamorous spectrum or some Berkley shit.
this is incoherent
Wow I should apply to Twitter now XD
I need to see more with her seeking jobs. She seems to know the SJW language as well :D
Tbh I think the employees are really talented and have high ranks a good degree, hence how they got the job in the first place at twitter, it’s just that twitter had no use for all these peeps who basically had no job, as a management student, having so many employees seems so redundant and unnecessary considering most of twitter is operated by auto generated AI
The snowflake generation. Lets cancel all their student loans...sarcasm
*_"¡Mimosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas!"_*
the cleansing
I get that Conservatives didn’t like the management of Twitter, with the banning of Trump, etc., but the animosity towards rank-and-file Twitter employees, and the glee at their firing, is truly bizarre.
Hysteria drama because a company changed hands? That can only mean they actually do have something to hide.
The only thing home schooled MAGA's need to know is beep beep fries are ready.
Waaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu. WokEs ARE TRIGGERREDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD. Hahahahahahaha/ THis is FUNNY. LMAO
Elon rules. 😅
Apt satire. Kudos to Elon Musk. Hope he takes twitter to new high
Applies to government workers also.
Lmao these Elon simps thunk Twitter used to run on air
Ha. Hilarious. .  Regardless, theses people will make $200k somewhere else in silicon valley
Can't tell if this woman is acting or they just paid an Ex-Twitter employee to be herself... 🤣
She should learn to code.
That Office Space reference.
The sad thing is, most of the programmers will breeze into good jobs or contracts on freelance websites owing to their tech stack experience.
Whole lotta wyt chics are going to be looking for work
Demanding words "WORK".
Blame bicycle helmets and t-ball for the downfall of Western civilization.
Man, you wouldn't get an interview if you were 10 minutes late.
It’s funny bc it’s true lol
Good they deserve that.
I usually don't personally find BB videos funny, but this is pure gold. They must've harnessed all the hatred from their unfair ban when writing this lol
One Twitter employee was shocked that they were fired - after calling their new boss a "Cock smoking lunatic Nazi...!" - Elon replied - "oh the injustice of it all.....!"
hahahahah that ending XD
Lmao genius
Y they r trolling gurus?
This is hilarious
I hate how everyone takes the side of a multi-billionaire when he fires highly paid workers... Like they are the "scum" of society when they've worked for it like everyone else...
This new generation brings their parents on job interviews and the first thing they want to know is how much vacation time do they get
🤣🤣🤣
I thought the grease was going to be a black face joke.
Did she just appropriate a few Black English terms?
The only way this video could’ve been made better is if the guy took her by the scruff of the neck and put his 12 inch steel toe boot and kicked her ass out the door.
It would be funnier if it weren't TRUE!
I don't know making fun people suffering and please don't do next time fun on Jews holocaust
So she's the one!
I don't think the Bee capitalized on the satire opportunity here. Bits were funny but most was SNL crap vibe. Not a good one imo
That's how Democrats act like?!..
so now cos you think Elon's better than sliced bread you make fun of someone who was fired due to his arrogance and plain nasty style of business management and severe lack of ethics - you're a disgrace and a feeble excuse for a news outlet.... have to wonder if you just faked the whole thing
Seriously though, depending on how long some of those ex Twitter employees were there, they may find themselves unemployable. Especially at a time when almost all industries are scaling back and any that are hiring would need an excellent value to consider someone. Under normal circumstances I'd feel bad for employees who got laid off at this inopportune time, but since we're talking about spoiled Marxists who have no value at all as organisms I'm totally happy with their situation.
It would have been awesome if he literally put the sink on the contract and pulled the actual plug on the deal
not believable, she's way too hot to be a programmer.
i LOVE HOW SIMPLISTIC YOU GUYS ARE!!!   You actually believe this nonsense!  I love watching ritchie rich blow 45 billion dollars and then turn a sucessful company into a failure.
This is gold.  She did a great job!
may they all die in the gutter in the shit
I have some honest hard work here on the farm.
This would be funny if it wasn't so accurate.
“Let’s laugh at unemployed middle class people” And they wonder why conservatives are bad at humor. S
Rewatch this after Twitter tanks from firing actual employees.
Bar Dancer,,,,
Lot of only fan accounts opening up
Watch out for your cornhole, bud.
Just not funny.
so, yr saying all twitter employees are lazy idiots???  that's nice.
This is a dumb take because not everyone is a moderator or HR hire at twitter. Plus you could just get a job at pinterest or another tech company. A dentist wouldn't apply to be a mechanic. Third I worked in manufacturing before and there is a fair share of male and female office workers who never touch the heavy machines but work at the computer and get paid more. The males typically do IT and watch youtube on the sly and the females do HR, eat takeout, and tell fathers how much child support they owe to explain why their check is only 2 cents.
I was always a secretary or administrative assistant for temp agencies - I stayed home during the summer with our kids.  I heard many times:  YOU'RE THE BEST.  A strong work ethic goes a long way.  As a temp I was always employed.
Effing great
i really enjoyed that, thanks. Subbed.
it's so funny you know it's true
I know it’s a comedy bit, but it was interesting to see him change his cognitive dissidents to suit her perspective. That's how they control! Should never lower yourself to someone's ignorance.
when did hard work and good work ethic become a bad thing?
Elon's literally begging them to come back god you guys are not funny like at least be fucking funny c'mon
Twitter out sourced their content moderator works, those people not even employed by Twitter, and don't have those benefit and compensation. Content moderator is a notoriously labour heavy, psychologically heavy and less paid job in IT industry.
I get it... script writing can be hard, but I thought you guys where funny! Pretend acting? Stick to punch lines!
Is plagiarism still a crime? Don't let Mike Judge see this.
I loved it very funny.
I thought they would hire her on her corn hold score.
The sad part is that this is 1000% accurate of the behavior of Twitter employees and pretty much anyone in big tech that is metastasized in Silicon Valley.
Truth
Really cool to see people using trauma and PTSD as a punchline. Omg you’re so triggered look at you.
I wonder how long before this is a real news story 😂.
Her reactions are actually very real
Holy shit. absolute peak boomer.
What's a TwoEater?
Most of the women at my previous jobs are 30% busy with their own cellphone, 20% chatting & joking with other coworkers, 10-15% snack time, 35-40% do their job. But there are some hardworking female co workers i know but probably in scale  2:10.
Funnier if not so true...
Priceless.. .
Truth through humor.  Love it.
this should be a series 🤣
So software development and corporate work is not a real job now?
wtf is cornhole sesh??
Absolutely right on and brilliant.
0:18 she's dying to laugh and I don't blame her. Awe inspiring how she nailed this perfectly.
how about a wake up call type situation. The would be boss / interviewer lays out reality and then she ask for a safe space or some such.
i would think that years pimping for the communist party can't possibly prepare anyone for a real job?? WELL the world needs ditch diggers too i suppose!
I sort of have that coworker always 30-40 minutes late every day, comes in at 8:30-40 every day. I go in at 7:00, but actually get in at 6:30 by the end of the week I'm clocking some time+half pay of 3-5 hours. That fella was shoulder surfing me and actually went to complain to the boss about how I made more money. He Ended up getting reprimanded, because no one noticed he was late every day and clocked out at his normal leave time never making up time missed.
Piękne
Hie hie hie
Mandy will start her own business selling scented candles for angry lesbians
I don't think it's very fair to say these people "did nothing." While I do agree those who were content moderators had it easy, the programmers and developers actually work very hard. It does require a proper college degree and considerable ammount of effort to learn and master programming languages.
True story. My brother is a liberal, just like this.  I can’t stand him.
How do I triple Like this?
To be continued: she's suing the factory for compensation for emotional distress.
Kids today are total trash.
so tell me Mandy , how much time do you spend on these tps ban reports? Mandy: time? time is an illusion ... time spent on tps ban reports?? doubly so
I have family members like that.
When are you guys going to hire somebody who can write a joke?
Well done.
"November 4, 2022: Twitter lays off nearly half of its workforce."   Not true. The employees themselves resigned. They were given the option to stay and work hard or resign. Well, they don't want to work hard and decided to resign instead. Don't blame twitter for that.
Image being mad about a billion dollar company allegedly treating their workers good.
Although fake it is funny.   Finally maybe the stores will go back to regular hours with all these people applying at fast food and corner stores.
New big business treat their employees like kids. They won't ever grow up.
She'll need a week of therapy after that.!!
Poor girl - all she's qualified to be now is a schoolteacher.
Nice! ☺️
It's funny how all these people in the comments make fun of twitter employees who they have never met before and say they aren't doing any work when they are even less qualified then them.
So....😳....no 😢 crying rooms or safe-speech zones ?....definite deal-breaker...
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Already a looser around billions of people competing for same work for dollar menu meal, now this?!
👍👍
Hilarious how you americans literally laugh at your own people in trouble, sit in your boats and laugh at the ones drowning and pick on theyr looks and tag stereotypes. You idiots literally think that such a big company would have run without hard working people in there? Normal ones and not these extreme woke stereotypes? Man from someone not living in US you people are like passengers in an airplane that is going to hit to hit the ground soon, and not in a safe landing. Your politicians and billionaires control you  and you are still living under slavery, corporate slavery. That Musky ahole  says to you to work 80 hours a week, and absolutely no one is against that ? He wants to make you more his slaves, and  ...this is your reactions ? Lol, have fun living the dystopian universe you tried so much to avoid. Two parties country with politicians payd by billionaires to favor the billionaires. Man what a joke.
This so funny! So sad.
Ridiculous but true
Still these ppl lost there job, and maybe they have family or friends to support ......don't forget that.
You remind me of an American version of England's  Monty Python.  So funny, so outside of the box.
Snotty entitled attitude
I wouldn't even entertain the idea of an interview with any of the people from Twitter
You, reading this, your IQ is likely low, far lower than Twitter employees. I’m sorry but it’s true.
When she said "cornhole", I was thinking of the other type of cornhole.
People like this actually exist, sadly enough.
So true
These Twitter Employees are going to have a very hard time getting a job because they are delusional and they don't want to work.
Companies like Twitter and Google hurt themselves when they implemented things like nap pods and other so-called perks that catered to eventual widespread entitlement.
Lol tremendous. What reason did they give all those people anyway, like when they apply for their next job and have to give a reason for leaving their last, do they just say "fired for being too woke?"
Glad u guys are back on TT
i like it.
I have doen construction for 25 years. My body is broke. My pockets empty. But those i worked for never miss a beat. This lady is right. People are just to stupid to undrrstand.
F**k them snowflakes with reality
Freakin amazing!
Is not only at Titter where we have this phenomena
best ending ever. The mimosaaassth! BAHAHAHAH
With all these tech companies laying off people, maybe they just need to learn how to...I don't know....weld?
This is to accurate for this channel
Lol so true. These spoiled woke losers in their mid to late 20's are now moving back into their mommy & daddy's home again. Their parents should still charge them for rent & pay for their own cell phone bills with their welfare checks.
I can’t believe that this can be true  And here I am, living in Poland where a lot of jobs you apply for demand you to know plenty tools, have experience, analytics thinking etc  Example - ICT company, they expect to know SQL, Python, business analysis, Tableau, Excel and whatnot and guess fucking what - 1,4-2k$ at best is what they would give   This really hurts my butt seeing that there are plenty of people who are useless to the company yet they make few or several times more than I do
Not only do I hope all these newly fired and broke Twitter employees show up at their parent's houses asking if they can move back home, I also hope their parents say no.
This is why Musk had to fire these people.
And a new OF account is born.
This is a stupid show. Was thinking something funny.
Twitter woke operatives democrats darkness operatives
Twitter darkness operatives worked at twitter deepstate darkness operatives infiltrated in to destroy our freedoms and country and rights .
Is this an example of a generation?
You guys think it's easy working at Twitter?  If it was this easy everyone would be doing it but they can't
Good sketch, kids.  And probably more accurate than it should be.  So many millennial snowflakes are simply devastated over the concept of actually having to show up for work at a designated time, paying for their own lunch and having to put in an 8 hour work day. And no more mamosas!  Feh!  Elon may not be a first ballot candidate for sainthood, but he's is a winner.  He'll always be a winner.  And Gen Z(ero) is, well, a class of whiners.
MuMosua''sz haha
It's so true of all millennials these days. Spoiled. Triggered by anything. Refusing to work. Playing the victim card at every single meeting. They are sick, sad and disgusting.
Whoever came up with the idea of a wine tap either deserves an award or to get fired LOL
Good, but back off AA bro
I've dealt with people almost that bad.  They become VERY disillusioned when they find out what the job is REALLY like!  And then I become the "bad guy" because I do the job, and I strive to do it well.  And I do do it well!  They move on soon.
Great scene from Office Space.
This new generation of entitled feeling mama's boys will be the demise of our once great ( Hard working) country.
BYE BYE LOSERS ... ELON IS THE GOAT!
Really like to see the qualification part of the application 🤔😲
An army of these people are knocking at the door.
Awww, she missed out on the rooftop parties. 🤣
nice office space rip off ;)
Elon Musk water legend from Australia THANKS 😊😊👍
In a country that outsources production, it's silly to expect it's people to be productive.
I know teenagers like this. For real. No exaggeration. Faces in the phone all day long, thumbs just working that keyboard like there's no tomorrow. Snapchat constant pictures of themselves. Sitting on the couch while parents get home from work and then clean so they can cook so they can clean again. It's fkn disgusting this was actually pretty spot-on.
Little bit of Office Space ripping off, but funny.
HERE'S A FUN GAME:  Try telling a Twitter employee and the average modern female apart...
the paper bag huffing and puffing was classic! search: millennial job interview. even funnier than this one!
I like to call back to office space! 😅 "So what would you say.. Ya do here?"
buahaha
yeah i work on site construction.  an interview like this would last 3 seconds with me, they walk in, i take one look at them, know they are useless & i just tell them to f'k off.  time is money and i'm not wasting mine on dipsh'ts.
Sadly there are so many government (your money) funded NGOs that will grab these useless individuals. Free market economy is virtually non existing in the West right now.
Haha gotta love these people in these comments who think they could last 1 day maintaining a social media site with hundreds of millions of users. Reality is these people are going to be employed again within days. Elon can brain drain the company all he wants and make who's left work 80 hour weeks. It won't work.
Liberalism is a mental disorder
I heard that Twitter employees don't exactly have the easiest job in the world. If the Dem party left Ronald Regan then it would be equally true to say that the Rep party left me.
So people fired by Twitter are probably software engineers and programmers. Why would they be interviewing at a manufacturing plant? If anyone has done programming, these guys can sit at a computer for 12 hours straight without batting an eyelid. Stereotyping them as soft probably not very accurate. If I was hiring someone fired from Twitter for a manufacturing plant, I'm not going to ask them to do grunt work. I'm looking at how they can make my operations more efficient using their programming knowledge and their job would be to maintain that efficiency.  There's working hard and there's working smart.  Also why stereotype blue collar people as simpletons and dummies?
Bro , did you ever apply for a dev position at twitter. 6-7 rounds interview, 2 coding rounds, system design questions. Employees will get 6 figure jobs in no time and not work as servers
Do "Google Bans Salt Emoji" next 😂
Fucving bitch did me!!!   PERMANENTLY!!!!!
I thought she was going to be offended by his wedding ring.
This is awesome
For the algorithm 👏👏👏🤙💪🤟🤓🥳😎
Time coming to works doesn't matter, or when you work, because all that matters is results. I hate that notion "being on time", if your work doesn't requeire you to talk to clients, just do the work, doesn't matter if it's on time or at night.
Babylon Bee really outing themselves about not knowing how a tech company works. Also, what’s funny is that the people that work at Babylon Bee are just as gay as the twitter employees.
sad thing is I've met some early 20 somethings that behave just like her
Just so perfect. Welcome back to Twitter.
Love these Onion News type of satire channels
Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!
Twitter employees are working 12 hours a day right now. This is BS.
Twitter was faring OK before Musk took over. So please don't pretend that the current situation is everyone else's fault. This gag is just humour. Stop posting comments about how accurate the whole thing allegedly is.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  its about time, let's see these fools trying to do real work . Pampered and entitled. This vid is probably so true for many , it's shocking .
I can create custom plugins for dozens of platforms but my 65 year old boss has hard time opening a PDF.
The same could probably be said about the people that work at a parody news site like Babylon Bee
First Real Job???  So Elon is CEO of a fake company? lol
I noticed that subtle Office Space ref
This is so real
I believe it's TRUE!  Depends on how you were raised.  Parents need to learn to be parents.
So this is one of the “slackers”!!!
They will destroy any companies that hire them
Wonder how they’ll get real jobs!
Dumb. I'm no fan of Twitter but I'm guessing they have/had some Rockstar intelligent employees. Lazy people automate the f out of their jobs
Ignoring the fact that Elon is now asking some to come back, do you really think that they’ll struggle to find work? Many are choosing to leave at the moment knowing that they’ll walk into something just as lucrative and with the same work conditions somewhere else. You may disagree with Twitter because of your politics, or because you’re jealous of how much they make, but their skills are the reason they can do this. I know that some of those who were laid off aren’t programmers, engineers, or other types of developers, but if someone was able to get hired at Twitter as support staff, they’ll have no issues getting on elsewhere.
Too funny we don’t use the word “work” 🤣🤣😜😝
Yea the Babylon Bee knows about real work sitting around on their fat ass while they hire someone else to do all the actual work while they write the worst dickriding jokes everyday of their life. Go fuck yourself hope you have fun being on Gab with a slightly larger audience cucks
Loved the Office Space reference!!
It's cringe content like this comes out after a hostile take over, lot of these people lost their jobs!  Idk I guess I can't fit into these super cringe your blue collar don't work takes, and that's from a infantrymen who has delivered for amazon and worked factories!
Good, poor babies do they need a pacifier!!!
I hope every twitter employee ends up homeless. Fuck them.
AWESOME, thanks Elon Musk.
"Afternoon Cornholling?!?!?!"
Nothing like a good old fashioned culture war! I can see that this is meant to be funny, but all it lacks is humor, otherwise it would be funny.
Salary is sooo racist😜
Thank you Elon.
am i the only one one who think this girl is nuts?
1:05.  "What would you say...ya did there?"  This has to be a reference to Office Space.  He uses the exact cadence and inflection when the Bobs asked Smykowski what he did there.
Kindergarten teacher in Florida
This is clearly not written by anyone who works in manufacturing or tech. Babylon bee is a bunch of soft handed comedy writers acting like they are working class pathetic
Elon approves this! 👍
Good actress... Hahaha
hopefully twittler will unban my accounts.
this had a real opportunity to be funny, but something about conservative humor misses the sophistication of great comedy
Sad part is. People like her actual exist ALL over the USA.
LOL
A billionaire pays way to much for a company.  He fires half the employees without knowing what they do. He threatens the employees that are left. One third of those employees choose to take a buyout the billionaire approved.  So now it's time to make fun of those employees who were given those perks without knowing anything about the jobs they did.  Some employees get huge cash bonuses, others get perks.
I speak for Gen Z when I say that we don’t claim her
This would be funny if it weren't so truthful. These woke fruitloops need to be put on the streets.
If I was interviewing this person, I would tell her go on break and don't come back.
WTF
So True!
ROFLMAO!
Does anyone know the song/music used in the outro?
What's all these left wing people going to do ,their again don't many support lockdowns , vaccine passports, supporting Stasi type regimes , want to bring Marxism to the west
Yea I don't think this is how Twitter employees worked. Its stupid.
I wouldn’t mind a corn holing session with her
No wonder Elon fired them
Justice served, at last. You guys feeling good about this? I'm feeling real good about this.
As much as I hate the stereotype of the only thing security guards do is sleep at a desk "watching cameras", it would be funny to see her apply for that stereotype of a job, and still find something wrong.
Definitely had to remind myself repeatedly that “cornhole” is a game with beanbags, and not weiners in and around the the poopshoot.
And I MUSK say...I love U, Elon❣💥💫🚀
3.2K of crying ex-twitter employees thumbs down this vid. 😹🤡
My best friend actually kept his job at Twitter......I'm trying to work out if that's a good thing....,or not..?
Nice reference to “Office Space”.
Too funny...
Worst thing is that this could be partially right xD
Oh man.. The pressure for lefty losers is too much.
They spend 13 million on food for their employees which a lot of it went to waste from what I heard.
Basements in parents' homes be like...   Hey, come on in. I always knew you'd come back.
lol- the office space reference
that was in no way funny at all
Holy shit this is cringe, is this what conservative comedy is?? 💀
He should've given her the contact details for casting couch since that's pretty much the only job left for these spoiled Twitter employees. The cute girls anyway. The rest can just wallow in despair.
Even though he's the world's richest man but he can't feed 1000  employees what a greedy billionaire
Lol!
Not just at Twitter. Almost everywhere now 🙄
Ok how much did Musk paid for this propaganda you have people like that at any job that is not specific to one place, even if they got their hands dirty people like that  would try not to do much, why some people look at Musk like he is some kind of god he just a regular person stop bowing to false gods, people really are like lambs guided by the wolf to slaughter.
Send Mandy to the farm in Nappa Valley … let’s see how she deals with grapes 😅
Elon is doing a recycle at Twitter ♻️
She looks like the skinnier version of Holly Furtick
i,hear,burger,king,is,hiring,lol,,,that,was,great,it,made,me,smile
Muskchan? 4chan? 8chan?
People who use Twitter on their resume is not leading with their best option. Like, 'I'm a pampered radical who only had to show up for actual work once in a while'. Yeah, that will get you a lot of callbacks.
it's brilliant 😀 Actress lady nailed it.
Ah, Christian comedy! With the audience being what it is, I should not have expected better.
just like modern dating
Man, it must suck to be a conservative. You guys cant make jokes, you don't understand humor. I guess thats a side effect of all that fascism you guys like to get involved in
Clearly satire, but I suspect there is more truth in this that we could bear to hear.
You earned my like a sub lol love this skit
Snowflakes
What should have happened:  Boss: You're late Mandy:  I am like totally banning you, you evil white man!
Aptly presented the lifestyle and behavior of ex-Twitter employees of pre-Elon era 🤣 Welcome to the real world where you have to do actual work :p
Today’s kids! Can’t blame anyone but ourselves!
Ex Twitter employees pronouns are now "was" & "were".
I couldn't finish this, but it's not TBBs fault - it's just too cringe.
Comedy is BACK
That is exactly what those left oriented ppl did working in twitter. There is no chance for them in normal society, those ppl has to many brain deviations !!!
Miss? Did you just assume their gender?
So if people working at twitter were so useless, how did twitter got so big?
Acting is also a job and this guy is not very good at it.
100% accurate!
She/her/girl totally got triggered by this he/him/guy
Those people will make out the best, and real businesses will reap the windfall of masses of talent on the open market.
I won’t hire one of these people to wipe my cats ass. They are the most worthless example of people in society
"do you offer free wine in the break room and what vintage?"
Here in Spain there are some Faculty Graduates excluded.
I deal with the G D costumers!
Rooftop Cornhole
It may be parody, but it's real as hell - There are actually people like this living in a fantasy bubble about to implode.
Man, you idiots on the right really know nothing about software huh? Developers will have a new job in 3 weeks from now. With 3 months severance. That's a reward not a punishment.
She is pretty, but...;)
Can some one please tell me if this is actually a reasonable expression of these people?
Would have been better if she was masked up
Awesome...that is all of social media not just Twitter!!
Society becoming this is why I live in bfe... it's like the movie idiocracy is really happening.
Funny and sad.
These are the kind of woman running America
Female twitter employees,  very useful as cum buckets, but only the good looking ones not the big fat ugly body confident bitches, nobody wants to wank over them.
har har
Hmm hmm, this was good,!! Liked throughout
Ha ha like the intro music 🎶🤣
Hahaha. This is the most unique video out there. Even though this is a dramatization, it is soooo true.  These little snowflakes are all on for a rude awakening when twitter and meta and others get the boot.
So true. Some jobs are a joke.
A sad and frightening truth, if she`s the future of the workplace, we`re all Donald Ducked. 😐
The interviewer was way too patient, tolerant and bent to her crap verbage. That's probably exactly how it would go down these days.
A lot of the comments here made me laugh. I work in AI research and know you need to be pretty damn good to work as a researcher for Twitter - the staff there would have been working very hard before the Musk takeover. People who don’t know shit about what’s it’s like to work in tech having an opinion…. Pffff
Let these facts sink in. There are approximately 5.5 million working age adult men not currently employed. We still have not recovered all the lost jobs from before Covid. Yah, the Biden economy is doing so well...NOT!
😅
Boomer comedy.
LOLOLOL
Brilliant!
Some interesting choices from BB.  Most of Twitter employees are men. Most of the fired people are men. Most of the layoff was on technology and engineering. Most of them will end up working on companies with similar structure and perks as the old Twitter.  But my biggest issue is why did this unfunny right-wing channel was recommended to me?
Ahahaha always on point. Soft and useless
Ya ………..former Twitter employees won’t have a problem finding a new job.
Thanks to Biden, the job market is so stretched that even incompetent, lazy and infantile workers are finding jobs.
She banned Steve from Fruitport, Michigan?!  🙂
She will start her new company 'Twit' within the next century.
THANK U E MUSK!!🎈🎈🎈🍷🍷
Kinda true
Looking for first real job...lol.  Welcome to the real world.
Gen "Z"ers to a tee
Oh how the nothing have fallen
The scary thing? this is very accurate......(and nauseating)
On point !!!
Nice
Twitter employees will have no problem getting jobs, that's why they all quit so quickly (they can find a better work situation than the chaos Musk had made of Twitter). They are high skilled workers. High skilled workers are able to demand more because their skills are valuable.
I love how he asks the question "What wold you say ya did there?!" just like Bob asks it in Office Space. 😂
That would be epic if Elon was commenting LMAO at this video and his comment was pinned at top
Yep a generation of entiled little prats But hey who created them the generation that bred them.  Don't blame the prats blame the parents Just goes to show anyone can breed but not anyone can parent ?
Childish at least?
You know that most of them didn't really have real jobs when half of them can be laid off and the company is still perfectly operational
This is better than prime time TV.
What's really funny to me is that the reason people like her get paid so much and have meditation rooms and shit is because conservatives think paying hard working Americans a living wage is communism 😂
Why are there factory workers in the Twitter offices? You're trying to tell me that's a factory office? 😂
I love when the pot calls the kettle black 😂  lmao I love the idea that the people who wrote this think they're anything closer to the blue collar worker than the girl character in this sketch   Also are y'all sponsored by AA or something or was that supposed to be a joke?
Hilarious......but, also worrying because this is the generation that will be running the world in the future?
I'm a manager of a small landscaping company and we totally play cornhole and get shit faced after work 😉😅
The ending caught me by surprise.  Very funny.
Love Elon! Now If Elon would take over Activision and Fix Warzone 2!
I was literally shaking watching this. You think this is funny. There are hundreds of valuable amazing people out there! hard stuffing stuff doers! without stuff to do!
Pretty funny but Twitter is actually very demanding and many of the jobs require a masters. I’ve known people that work there and they are brilliant. Not sure how it is now with Elon tho lol
Really? Real job?! You are a joke! If its not "red" is wrong
Is this channel on just to fluff Elon's ego.Most of the people fired here software engineers..parody is funny only when accurate. This blows.
I previously worked at Google but I didnt see ANYTHING like the employees footage of how “Lax” twotter was! You guys NAILED THIS! Grew up in the Bay and now that I live outta State i probably wont EVER RETURN!
This video was incredibly painful to watch as you clearly dont know anything about content moderation.
I live in Fruitport Michigan.
Thanks! I needed the smile!
Twitter employee....the pinnacle of millenial thinking....ohh but thinking...omg that would require effort
Thank god someone actually captures the uselessness of the modern yuppie tech worker, earning 6 figures doing bullshit for a bullshit media company.
Lol. Fruit cakes
Libs...
Nailed it.
Comment for the algorithm.
I loved her acting . Surreal
Kudos for getting the fugly look and sneer down pat, amazingly accurate portrayal.
Man, conservative humor is so archaic
In a bid to adjust that interviewer bent backwards so far his neck snapped.
You could switch out Twitter employee for YouTuber or content creator
Good stuff. Liberals are silly.
Babylon bee employee doesn't try to get a real job.
ahhh get it....the people laid of by daddy musk are just lazy LGBTQ-SJWs and not IT-techs....i know this is satire but damn why are they so far up Elons Buttocks.
Can anyone tell me what makes them dye their hair red pink or purple, is it a gay gang thing
Good job Done Elan.  Too many lazy ass nerd work from home doing shit.
I like her expressions.!
Byog😂😂😂😂
I was prep cook at a fine dining restaurant,  the new hire had a knife and looked at me and said..I don't know how to..use a knife.
I'm glad he did this we're short nurses, doctors, labourers , truck drivers and farmers instead of sitting around all day they can get a real job
#learntobeekeep
They will all have to find real work now instead of spending all day on their smartphones and drinking expensive coffee while talking nonsense to their colleagues, i hope they don’t burn my McDonalds burgers 🍔 😅
Coding is a real job.
The TRUE
I don’t think these people from twitter realise what's happening. For a start they will bring a toxic work culture nobody wants, they were asked to work hard and left their job, who would want to employ anyone like that.
let's be real: 3 years of twitter employment must make the next job easy to find
Funny 😀
LMFAO. Good luck with hiring freezes & big tech layoffs.
Far be it from me to comment on what consenting adults get up to,  but are you suggesting Americans are actively engaged in “corn holing” sessions at work? I’d never have guessed the fuzzball table was a gateway activity to this kind of thing. Whatever next? The mind boggles.
Twitter is idiot .  I made fun of a Iranian secularist and they banned me .
That is not how the end would go...  Roof top grill out... and beer, the corn hole though yeah that can stay lol
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!
Those clowns got what they fucken deserve
I hope they dont find work, s. Bags
Lol @ having greasy hands. So manly, like smoking cigarettes. Imagine how manly you will look with skin cancer, because thats the risk you run from having harsh chemicals on your skin for extended periods of time.  In mechanic school they now suggest wearing gloves......so unmanly. I cant believe Harely Davidson would cuck alpha males like this. Of course not a single sole at Babylon Bee has hard hands or does manual labor. "Pneumatic drill is on the fritz again!!" Hahahaha thats so stupid
I am sure Fragile meds are flying off the counters
This girl can sure act.. she’s real good!!
hahahahah
I Know That She is your wife but I think she is Preety....
I wouldn't even be surprised if half of Twitter staff was at work for, like, 2 hours a day, but billed the full 8 to 10 hours.  Yes, that happens a lot. (There was this one big company that fired over 900 of its employees because of doing exactly that. And you might guess the ideological and political leaning of those employees. Or should I say "leeches", because "employee" is too polite.)
Let the Red Hats do the coding. It might work. I have no prejudices.
buch of muscovites here god they show no pity...
I’m surprised that you could call her Ms 😂
Is this funny?
Welcome back to Twitter :)
Have seen those lazy people unable to come to the office a lot, one guy was working so much out of the office that he forget to pick up the phone after 14:00 (his working hours were from 9:00 to 18:00).
I hear Disney is hiring. They have the same cult mentality.
Basically everyone moving out of twitter is going to make bank at other tech companies. The reality is when you've got that on your cv/resume (plus what it took to get to twitter in the first place), you're not going to be making less thank 80k a year or whatever for the rest of your life.
We all know they are pampered idiots that will never survive sat a real job. Pansies.
"Twitter is rotten to the core the only way to save it is to  pull it from the root" Some senator meme out there
What is the funny part here? You are just exulting over other person struggles. I would rather wish for everyone to have her ex job, not for everyone to suffer min wage physical labor.
Well done...and 💯 TRUTH😋🤣🤣
any good looking female Ex-Twitter Employee can contact me, I pay good money for anal sex. she can also take pictures and videos for her Onlyfans.
The Babylon bee trying to be funny impossible challenge
This is about on par... good on Elon for showing these children how the real world works.
If this is the comedy Elon was talking about then I don’t want it back
She's so cute
This is what our education system is producing in America they are making our kids a bunch of pussies if a world war broke out today who do you think's going to fight this war us 50 somethings are going to have to strap a set of boots on and do some American ass kicking because our younger generation is going to be hugging her teddy bears in their blankies and hiding in the closet
People I work with in software are constantly on sick leave, taking time off, and taking holidays.  Way too soft. All you have to do is agree with them and they think you are a team player.
oh, WD40 liquid on the table - very useful thing
The Babylon Bee? Isn't it this russian propaganda website?
Thank you Elon Musk! Am on my 3rd account and first suspension!😃
They're being hired by the IRS and Home Land Security.
When im in my 80s and still have a working body. I’ll know that it was the commitment to myself and not dumb companies that got me there.   Good luck dying in your 60s after living in pain from wearing y’alls bodies out at work, idiots
Lol everyone outside of the journalist fake hysteria really don't care about those priviligerad people. Twitter has been a fun ride the last few weeks!
this is like SNL for 14 year olds
lol. people here are literally in favor of employees having zero rights and merely tools for their bosses. Work hardcore so the boss gets even more richer and you end up with a broken social life and a burn out...for nothing. They are not "employees", they are highly skilled professionals. lol.  Belittleing people just because they are "liberal", or "conservative"  is so dumb, folks.
The fantasy of a right wing extremist that a well educated person who works in software engineering would apply for a job as a building supervisor is so ridiculous... Oh man you are trying so hard... but it´s actually sad
It bothers that people exist like this out in this country.  Scary times.
SO TRUE! 🤣
That’s actually a real job. The time it takes to learn for it is INSANE. The work to learn it is CRAZY. My fiance is working on it now and it’s days and days and days up at a time turning in hundreds of hrs of school work to be a IT specialist. It’s not easy. I respect physics workers a ton. I am one.  I can’t shit on intellectual and mental workers tho. That’s a whole different type of work that not everyone is built for. We all do what we can for ours and he’s working soooooo hard for our family. So hard. Teaching himself things I could NEVER dream of learning.
Elon was probably asking them to work a long 8 hour day, modern day slavery right there 🙄
I was wondering why this is cringe and not funny, but then I've noticed it's Babylon Bee.
She’ll find something
Absolutely brilliant Office Space ref :)
1:10  So, what would you say, you _did_ there ...      Classic nod to Office Space. ;-)
My First Month with Type II Diabetes https://healthylife000011.blogspot.com/2021/11/my-first-month-with-type-ii-diabetes.html
Way to shit on the middle class who work in factories. Who build your vehicles. and guess what it ain't mf boomers. They are the ones who act the most entitled and lazy. They get two years in and are the worst workers we get. WHO TF DO YOU THINK IS DOING THE MANUAL LABOR? ITS MILLENIALS AND GEN Z. 🤦🏻‍♀️
LMAO gtfo out of here @Motor City Nerds please watch this and remind these losers of these horrible female millennials who are lazy while you build trucks for ten years 12 hours a night and thru the pandemic. Boomers are the ones who cry the most we just had to literally let a 50 yr old man go to medical because he said his "butt hurt"
This was written by someone that never interviewed for a "real job" and y'all are buying it. 🤣 One office clown acting like the other office clown is the only clown. And you brain dead sheep eat it up
same jokes told by posh fox news hosts who have cars that take them to work where their hair make up and wardrobe is ready and then they just read off a teleprompter....anyone who hates on coders and engineers who are blue collar are class traders....youre a piece of shit.
Hahaha hahah. This is choreographed to perfection. Both of them role played the interview with precision and the guy at the door was the cherry on the top.
That was funny.
Absolutely useless human beings lmao
The real modern 'worker' so realistically presented!
this is snowflakism.
It's insane how many people are/were, paid to pretty much attend adult daycare at these tech companies. The layoffs at Twitter and facebook were over 15k people, most of which probably never did any work their entire time at the company.   Libs have the audacity to protest against wall street and demand a tax on wall street speculation when wall street speculation is what allowed all of this waste in tech to happen. Their paychecks are financed by investors while these tech companies burn through investors money with all the wasteful unresponsible spending.
Great documentary.
In real life the interviewer would kick her out on the spot within first few questions.
i know its a skit, sadly its a reality too
'thuh office'. No, it's said 'thee office'.
I have a friend who works for Google, this is not very far off from the stories I hear. How people can make over a 100k and do little to nothing is astounding. If only imposter syndrome caused people  to burst into flames.
Trump applied for his first real job, then he fucked that up too. ByeDon2020
"rooftop corn hole sesh"????
Conservative comedy is so hilariously bad that it's actually good. You just know that this is legitimately how older conservatives view younger workers.
not funny keep trying dad
They should learn to weld.
Crazy to think that so many interviews are recorded for the public to see.
I actually have a 20 year old daughter just like this, Her Mom encourages it, I do Not, I'm a GenX US Marine I do not except mental weakness of any kind. Probably why I'm Hated but respected. I know my daughter will see the light in her late 30's when her Mom and Dad are dead and gone
LOL!!!
😄😄😄
I don't think neither elon was fired or he is a woman
Me:so what do you do for a living Her:oh I’m a content moderation specialist Me:oh so your entire existence is worthless good to know
Pretty accurate
Great work from Leon  Workers like that pathetic woman would be a negative piece of compost to any company.
😂😂😂👍
I got an "Office Space" vibe from this vid!
Funny but sad!  So true of so many young people
This is the most accurate way to describe a fired Twitter “Employee” ! Where else can a woke moron get a nice paycheck without actually DOING ANYTHING?  Please let me know as I am perfectly capable of NOT doing anything either and I could do it for less than $250,000. Per whatever!
You should be glad for the age of the internet - all of you, Bee included, can get bullshit jobs like this instead of working for a living.
Bro how is this funny?
This video borrows rather heavily from the now famous 'A Millennial Job Interview.' Compare the interview with Amy to this interview with Mandy. Amy wins full points for texting while the patient baby-boomer employer asks her pertinent questions.
These now former employees are so childish!!! GTFU and get a life.
😂 "We"
That end twist got me good. LOL
She reminds me of NOWANNA ..... NOWANNA JOB ..... Right ? ! !  ! .........
God damn this is beyond cringe. Jesus Christ.
Gotta really love the Bee.
Ummm…You’re projecting. If you have a job above entry-level at Twitter, you’ve probably got a college degree and a serious savings account.
When satire isn't satire because it's sadly true.
Loooool they are crying about no more free lunch
Noone's in babylon bee ever known what tech company is like, and this proves it lmao
This is awesome. For resumes of people who worked at YouTube, Twitter and/or Facebook in the last decade, we put them in a special trash can marked as "Banned for Hate Speech" and about once every couple months we verify our own fact-checking that paper still catches fire.
office space reference. nice.
Are they allergic to hard work? 😂
Little known fact: The people who wrote this skit never worked in a factory either
This is cringe as fuck lmaoooo L
If my co-workers were fired, and then I was told I needed to work 15 hours and sleep at the office,  I'd quit...  Lol, if I worked at Twitter, I'd quit as soon as Elon took over. Working for an egotistical idiot who terrorizes his employees with treats and calls the police on them is not a good place to work. Unless you're a subservient boot licker who will believe and do anything they are told.  The fact that y'all think all Twitter employees are like this girl proves how stupid you are. Most of them are extremely smart tech wizards, they just happen to be on the list of people who spoke out against Elon and got fired for it.
😂
50 dollar street bj's in the park is about all shes worth
If only Elon had come dressed as the Terminator.  The Twitterminator!
Right wing comedy isn't funny
Do you have something to say about the attitudes toward you? Join Squawki microblog 🇬🇧 now launching and have your say. Squawk the Squawk
It's not only twitter most of the people who works at corporate level likes to do less work and more fun activities to build team wok. If you're an introvert working in a tech company be prepared for anxiety attack every single day
Hilarious!!!!!!! I LOVE the nod to "Office Space". If Twitter was a 3rd of what they're claiming, it just breeds lazy.useless people that are a waste of oxygen. Why don't we just call up Elon, have him "Ship" all the ex-Twitter people to the moon and they can do their own thing THERE   nuff said?
Is it me or is Elon musk making a brand new version of Brewsters Millions as we speak
This video is so shit I love it
i would laugh if it were not for the fact that tens of thousands of these people are are running around thinking in these companies
Hilarious!
The past few generations have been brainwashed by the fantasy world of this culture which has become more toxic with the passage of time.  Therefore, I am not going to assign any guilt to this generation or prior generations for what appears to be borderline insanity.  We have become just what we were programmed to be.  And, we can be programmed to do stupid things until our true nature rebels against the insanity.   I sense that time is coming soon for many more of us.
DISCLAIMER  NO actual work got done in the making of this video.
How dare you portray those hard-working unemployed people like this?!
Conservatives making a video to unironically own themselves is so funny
As someone who works in one of these factories, these poor folks wouldn't last a minute.  And we're union.
Yes I know The Babylon Bee is parody:  I'm sure reality is going to set in soon for many of these spoiled tech industry asshats. I doubt many actually saved a part of their 6 figure salaries.
👍👍👍👊👊
Lol what the fuck is this. I'm an ex employee, also a vet. This is bullshit but go ahead and own the libs I guess.
This is supposed to be funny btw, right wing comedy at its best?
Enjoy reading all the leftist snowflakes melting down over this. 😂😂😂
Wine on tap lol
*Twitter literally collapsing without it's employees* These guys: They're useless
Carlin would be so proud the word cornhole was used.
Yes, kick the victim. That seems necessary
hot take but I don't think Elon deserves the talent twitter had. I hope the new/rehires twitter gets are just awful quiet quitters. those engineers and developers who are in need of work will probably bounce into a better paying role somewhere else.
That shit was cringe as fuck.
1:05 YES!
The acting in this was like watching a porn without the sex scenes
Omg it's like when he fired all these millennial zoomers he was able to like get all the big chungus meme 420 69 work done. It's like who even needs 44 billion dollars. Papa musk showed that when you fire your work force you can slim down your company by like 40 billion dollars and these millennial gen z libtards can just go drink pumpkin soy lattes or w/e at their actual successful businesses that poached them after a billionaire man child tanked a multi billion dollar company in less than a month.   That's what I call owning the libs amirite fellas!
Thank you for this video.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!
I'm a customs clearance broker, that's a real job unlike Twitter..
lol hahahaha 🤣
Perfect ending lmfao
Sad part is it's back to the regular censorship.  They only let on some milquetoast establishment "conservatives" like zio shill Jordan Peterson.  Well, while they banned most of the real-right people with larger followings, a number of "little guys" thought-criminals like me are on there now, but Musk just announced any "far right" stuff will be throttled/shadow banned so you will only see it if you know where to search for it.  Regardless of how many views it will no longer show up in "trending", as stuff like #thenoticing had a few times recently.
conservatives believing this is true while posting about it on platforms like twitter and youtube created by the people they are make fun of.
Just isn't funny or true ? ?
I don't know what to say. It's so cringe but it also seems like that's what might actually happen.
What's a cornhole session?  I dare not google it cuz I know of another meaning and don't wanna  look at that.
twitter layed off way more than half of its workforce, ofc babylon bee cant get the most simple of facts right
Two words. Only fans.
Real life is cruel.  Twitter will no longer exist soon.  Now that we have to pay for it then it isn't worth it.
Lots of "My workday at twitter" videos dissapeard the last couple of days.
anyone laughing at this is a boomer
The dumbest thing i have ever seen. Imagine thinking a web developer/data scientist/data engineer who studied  for at least 5 years would apply to that kind of job 🤣🤣🤣 right wing trumptard lunatics are really really dumb
Wow conservative comedy is next level funny
Useless people
The sad thing is just how accurate that probably is...
It's sad that a person can be dumb enough to think this is funny.

Lmao
Does anyone at the Babylon Bee know how to fix or use a Pneumatic Drill?
so close to reality
Imagine your job is writing for the Babylon Bee, and then accusing others of not having real jobs
Sad part is that is the majority of the woke force everywhere
wtf is this shit... hahahaha
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38
Nobody wants them. I would not hire them.
All the MAGA idiots commenting that the fired employees won't find jobs even as baristas should know that each of those guys is probably more educated than your entire family combined
Right when he said your 20 minutes late, I was like oh here we go
hahaha this is exactly what i envisioned twitter employees to be like. i mean what do they even do there, 1000s of people to do what??!!!
If I ever find this funny I'm sleeping on a train track
An ex-twit flutter to a new job.
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE NEW CLASS OF JELLYFISH.
Just hilarious!
Great...you come in like you're in charge....that doesn't work in the real world!
even layoffs more than 75% employee ,twitter still run fine
I love the office space reference! 😂
She's fucking hot though.
GREAT ENDING. 😂
Thank you.
I love you Bee!
Learn something new every day - that "cornholing" is not what it used to be.
Yeee haaaw brothers comedy is legal again!!!!!
F*** real ... the good part is thanks to you I was laughing as the world would end ... the sad part, I have to go back on this Monday to work with some of these freaks ...
liberals so weak
LMAO, mad that young people are smart enough not to fall for the stupid shit you old farts did.
Bro no way u guys found this unironically funny😭😭😭
Man yall are old lmao
Bruh this company hasn't even Been out for a full two decades. Maybe you should of did one when small business owners like me had to go apply for there first job after losing there own business because of "safety" even though people to this day are dying dramatically from covid. But yes ex twitter employees
Sad thing is 9/10 out of ten they give this woman the contract over me.   That's what life has come to....streamers, rich kids, wealthy immigrants and hot chicks get work.  The working class folks who can DO the job...get laid off and thrown to the wayside.    Thanks life.  You rule! :(
nice ending
I totally get it with the author means by  cornhole , She takes time out at twitter from Ass sex videos to cancel people.
I was feeling bad for Twitter employees because Twitter itself isn't a representation of the employees but then I heard that Musk put a stop to paid lunches so then I was like, "yeah, ok they were spoiled."
Good. Twitter needed a total overhaul. Too many biased LEftist nutcases working there. Responsible for canceling tons of people who they didnt agree with or are conservative or republican or legal gun owners or even some Christians. they canceled a President because he was REpublican and didnt follow their agenda. Glad they all got canned or left. Now maybe Twitter can be a more freedom of speech friendly
Well done with the Office Space reference.
Had potential on the setup but skit would’ve been better if they were working at Starbucks. Logically that would tie better than an auto shop, some of the lines have been beaten into the bush with the classic lib jabs. Would’ve found it funnier to have her applying at Starbucks then realizing she’d have to do work, then follow up with her trying to get other people to tell her their pronouns, not realizing most people making minimum wage don’t give a shit.  That’s how you make a liberal jab. The lack of connecting with the common below average middle class, because the libs cater to the high income and college graduates, which is not the average American
😂😂😂😂 MF’s
I have no sympathy for any of those people. They had a Big Brother circle jerk echo chamber of Leftist elitism for years. Happy job hunting! I don’t care what happens to Twitter, even if it crashes & burns all the shocked & indignant whining is WORTH IT. It’s music to my ears 🤣
I’m interested in the position. How is your health plan? Do you have a 401K? I will do overtime.
Yeah, if she worked for me, she would have been fired right at the start.
Lol sad but true
Update: curiosity got the best of me I watched the video and man it sure would be nice to relax opps I mean work work work  at Twitter
Give such a person a boot in the ass out the door..........a woke democrat?
The fact that this is on the trending page is so righteously funny 😂
TWTR was dead money all those years, Another 18-24 months ready to go public,  be a real company that we can invest $'s into! 😉
Conservatives are so far down the rabbit hole. Only the smart ones will eventually save themselves. Thats why so many eventually turn left while you barely see anybody on the left go right. If youre a conservative reading this please just take a step back and watch a hasanabi stream on youtube
Good now fire aoc
Cringe boomer humor. The real joke is the people who find this funny 😂
Terrible acting and what was the point of the AA “joke”???
Elon musk is a giant elite piece of unamerican garbage stop sucking his cock
Whoa that title "Fired Twitter Employee Applies For First Real Job" ok then I dare not asked what were they doing before they got release from Twitter? So I guess I'll thumbs up this one then move on.
Rightwingers: The left can't meme.  Also rightwingers:
They're baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
My wine is ready, yeah, right next to my meditation room.
All ok to mock the woke, but why mock "Guru" or "Meditation"?
The funniest part is as much as conservatives like to talk up "real jobs" like factory work, If you say manual laborers deserve to earn a living wage conservatives will call you a communist.
THESE WOKIES GO BACK FLIPPING BURGER...BACK WHERE THEY BELONG GOOD RIDDANCE ELON
I thought there be some kind of blackface joke with the grease
Hilarious!!! Loved it!!
Generation Z is possibly too far gone to rescue.
I will say that I do feel bad for the *few* (and Im sure there were few) employees who actually DID do work, didnt drink on the job, play cornhole or needed Yoga or meditation rooms.  And there had to be a few because Elon did admit that he did hire a couple thousand back as they actually were a valuable asset and essential for running twitter.  I, however, dont feel sorry for the "Mandys".  I do hope this is a wake up call and all will get employment soon.  I feel, however, that most will simply see themselves as victims and will cry and say its not fair, etc.
😁 L live in Fruitport, Michigan. Who is this Steve...
I don't know who the girl was, but she nailed it, good job.
This is hilarious hahaha
Twitter is one massive demasculinated cornhole simp orgy
@2:49 the hand hilarious.
The same group of people here who somehow believe tech workers are lazy bums and that manufacturing workers are the only real "hard working" people out there would vehemently protest the idea that those "hard workers" receive the pay they deserve then, claiming it to be socialism and a handout. You really just want an ego boost with no quality of life changes.
LOL
She said she wanted a job . She never said anything about wanting to work .
Wow hilarious video. You got the whole club laughing 😐
I disliked this video  Dumb as ph'uk
Get ready for the teenagers who are about to enter the workforce... they think that swearing is their "culture", can't put their iPhones down for a minute and will sass the shit out of you over nothing. I can't make this up. We are doomed.
😄😄😄
lmao luv it too funny shame its sad but true
I thought she was going to accuse them of being in "black-hand."
I know this is satire, but the first minute and a half really pissed me off.  Well played, BB...
I was told that this was a comedy video. Where were the jokes?
okay great what about thousands of people who never had real world experience like me with mental disorders and you're worried about one woman
My god , conservatives must be the most braindead human beings I have ever seen.
😂🤣😂🤣
"What would you say Ya did there?" Was that an office space reference?
This is some massive copium.
How is this any different than any of the content creators at Babylon bee applied for a real job.
Welcome to the real world, may God have mercy on you and honestly most of us hope He damns you to hard labor for the same amount of time you spend at Tweeter
I'm proud of my father, and grateful for him! I miss him... but that's another story... I have many flaws, and I'm far away from "perfect" and this is not about me...but! The point is, I had a kind of father that provided me and my brother many wisdoms through many years, and that's why the both of us never had problems shake the hands of someone that is dirty from work! On the contrary!  If you have similar or same parents hug them, until you have the opportunity!
Hard to watch
😂😂😂
What would ya sayyyy... Ya did there? LOL! Flashing back to a classic. Twitter's woke culture is being set ablaze by the new Boss. If they want to keep the red stapler. They had better discover the red pill!!
She should try "working" at Target--it's become "wokeness a-go-go" there...
so insted of neol lib snl cringe its boomer conservative snl cringe
Holy shit who are the dumb fucking sheep who find this clever?
Conservative comedy fuckin sucks
STARBUCKS... and she should melt down mentally, and post her rant, that she has to work there 6 or 8 hours a day! PLEASE make that video happen! :D
She can always do onlyfans.
I mean, if we look at the world and the beliefs this channel holds, clearly the twitter engineers are just way smarter than all you guys… right? Because meritocracy is a real thing and anyone who makes lots of money deserves it because they worked hard. So move on, twitter workers going into finding new jobs in Tech have significantly more skills than anyone here watching yt. Learn a programming language or a new technology. These are life skills you need now, unfortunate for those people here who claim to have “real” life lessons such as burger flipping or maintaining a car. Those don’t get you anywhere now. When you’re rich, why own a car? Just Uber, less expensive in a city.
Conservative comedy really do be terrible
You are mental.   You realize that a software engineer at twitter as a Tier 1a SDE role  on pare with working as companies as Microsoft, IBM, Sun, Orical, etc.    These would be Engineer roles consider so important and so skilled that have 30 years of off shoring, they don't trust it to be done out of india, china, finland, or ireland.    The median pay for SDE 1 with 0 years of experience but makes it through the interview process (the vast majority applicants  do not make it through skill testing needed to get a phone screen) and then of those 1 person will get a job for every 500 applicants that make it past a phone screen,  That entry level engineer will be making around 200k with base pay and bonus.  And if s/he doesn't get their first promotion within 2 years, they will be kicked to the curb.   They may get 1 more shot with 1 company at a the same level, and if they don't make it there that is it they had their chance.   SDE are regularly expected to work between 60 and 80 hours for the first 5 years until they reach the Sr.   At which point, they're hours probably go down a bit, but their responsibility and accountability goes up.   That is the end of the career path for the vast majority.   A very few will break out of the Sr level and reach Principal at which point they will hold the same level of accountability as a Director as most companies and still have to do engineering work.    All the perks are just things designed to keep people at their desks doing work longer.    Oh and while might think the pay is obscene, the company is making way more off their labor.     You are literal insane.    There is no hippy kids working at Amazon.   They might be liberal socially, but in a extremely competitive field these are the people of have consistently won over and over again because of the tallent, the work ethic, and the abilities.   None of them are barrestas.  Several have already launched new companies in just the last week.      I knew conservatives were whinny babies, but I didn't know you where this fucking stupid
These "comedy" writers must have went to the same liberal arts college as the SNL writers, because this skit is just that bad, maybe even worse.
What's with this right wing narrative of twitter workers being lazy?
Twitter could be run by max 20 people.
Perfect!
Drain the swamp,get rid of all the babies and keep the adults.
Personally, I think if you waited to get fired by Karen Musk then you probably deserve to work for him.
Freeloaders the lot of em
Wow looks like the worker shortage for fast food workers has been solved
hahaha
Love it these people that work for say Twitter have all this mediation rooms etc are the most none productive and they think they are king shit and don’t know a think about real life like we’re their food comes from we’re their cars come from and the people drilling on the hot sun all day to supply the fuel for the expencive cars and the people that put their bags on the plane and unload at the other end maybe the works of the world should make the. Companies pay them the same or more to supply services to these assholes and make them pay high prices and see them come down a few pegs in life they are some of the most useless people on earth they say we need to reduce the population we should start with them
That is humor, based in reality, as all good humor
Want 🍟 with that..
it's a faked video ...skip it.
😂😂😂😂
Wow this is awful comedy and you’re all lapping it up like it’s comedic genius.   Conservatives are so fucking bad at humour.
Fuck, time to cancel "comedy" again.
awww. you realize parody like this only works when theres truth to it right? silicon valley is literally going on a feeding frenzy to grab these folks
This is some amazing boomer humor.
The way people are putting the ex employees of Twitter down and glorifying Elon is absolutely disgusting. Be ashamed Bee, try to stand up instead of bending down for space Karen
Suprised the libs haven’t stepped in with a bail out to help all these fired employees with 99 years of unemployment
Brilliant
Weren't employees working 60 hours a week and constant abuse? This video makes no sense.
More like gtf out hahaha
We will be cooking and eating these people in no time flat
good job .. erm .. i mean .. well done stuff :D
Has anybody running this channel actually seen comedy?
...you do realize twitter is one of the most successful social media sites ever, right? You don't get that from incompetent employees (even if its user base is a different story)
I don't know Steve but I live near Fruitport!
Never had cage free shrimp. Served best with a little gluten free salt.
Glad you have been re-twitterized. Good Job.
Hey girl, I can hire you to catch what my dogs drop behind, just need to check your papers.
the funniest part is all the wokies quit and now they can't get the money owed to the employees who had expenses. go woke be broke
This is NOT funny at all. Who wrote this? A freshman drama team?
You guys could probably write great fiction novels with all the made up scenarios you come up with.
The best part is that the only time the actors from this sketch got their hands dirty while working was while the were doing this video.
Twitter employees will be the future crack heads of tomorrow.
...!😂🤣
Watch David Packman show hershal walker son distroying trump's endorsement watch till the end
Ex-Twitter Employees at their next job:  "Elon Musk sucks.  Would you like fries with that?"
Conservatives: we are the only Americans, we are the only people who love their family, we are the only people work, and everything else is just gay communism.
Wait 'til she gets to Hell ...
Excellent! All the idiots will understand what work really means. Thanks Elon
All these replies below, I am not sure who you people are or how much real life knowledge you guys have about former Twitter employees, their former culture, etc. What is transparent here.is.that the ones who wrote many if  not most of the responses have none. These people, or you people, sound like these conspiracy theorists or the parrots who keep on repeating these nonsense ideas. Twitter was an excellence center with world class quality professionsls. Their Software Engineers, Software Security Engineers, Architects, Developers, just to mention a few, are on par of those on Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and many others. My apologies if this is just sarcasm on top of the disaster the Musketeer is causing to a company with tremendous potential to keep innovating and being a tool many of us got us ed as part of our routines. I am going further: we are losing more and more in the competitive lsndscspe: top Uni professors, many graduating students are leaving, but we still have 85 of the top 100 Unis in the world. Our forward thinking technology companies (not including the dinosaur retrograde oil companies, automobile companies) are the best in the world. Further, many of them have overseas campi  either by acquisition or by organic inception. If any of you do not understand these professionals whose culture developed around this new model, and you guys still.consider the correct environment the molding offices of GM, Ford, Bank of America HQ, and other dinosaurs, I'm so sorry, no.wonder Google, Apple, Microsoft etc.have a much leaner operation and market cap with the power to cash purchase most of those dinosaurs if they wanted the mold to spread. Just one last yell out of my rent: Twitter's employers and their colleagues from other big techs are financially independent - if not real rich - in their 30s. While the dinosaur employees are just the exploited cattle with little perspective other than work 9 to 5, pay as much mortgage as they can, and retire in a senior community with the equity money from their mortgaged house. I do not think it is funny to have a narcisistic privileged man-baby to acquire a company just because he can and throw it down the drains.  That's what happens when some gets limitless wealthy power, having more money himself than ~75% of the whole US population, the same population with poor - if any - access to health care, little opportunity to receive higher education, if any, doomed to either work at low level income jobs incorporate America or very happy for keeping their traditional century old charcoal mining job with s 36 life span. C'mon folks.
ROFLMAO ... this "pathetic excuse" parody ... is unfortunately, MUCH closer to the truth that most will admit!!!! She doesn't even reach the level of "idiot" ... or ... garbage bag changer!!!!
you're so unfunny it hurts
kornhole
what is cornhole?
Th only thing funny about this video is how ironic it is. Literally making fun of lib twitter employees for having "never worked a real job" when you can be damn well sure that the people who created this video have never worked a blue collar job in their lives.
If being a twitter employee isn't a real job then neither is whatever the f*ck you do. You're so embarrassing
So cringe
Almost funny. The office space schtick was a tribute or stolen... Not sure.
The new gen is so awesome and they work so hard, just ask them😂
this is sooo good. :))))
Is this parody?
She won't say the word 'WORK' but Content Moderation Specialist is just fine. And so I'm guessing 'a baby incubator person' is the new Woke term for 'expectent mother'.
To be fair, trying to shake someone's hand knowing your hand is dirty is both disrespectful and disgusting.
According to gossip the University of Missouri (Columbia) serves free lobster amongst other costly (to me)  eats.
Haha oh man. That physically hurt to watch it was funny lol.
And this is funny! So true too!
:D
They are going to find out what that four letter word is really all about aren't they
Pretty much sums up the entire millennial generation.  to thing, one of these people will be President someday lol No wonder the USA is circling the drain now
I can perceive no other plausible outcome.
Conservative comedy is the epitome of cringe, this is genuinely unwatchable.
And there you have a peek at the future - can't wait !
Facist channel
I wonder how many bots are here
Learn to coal 😉😂🤣
Shouldnt get a job anywhere, cause they are stupid, all of them!!!!
I'm from Fruitport MI. Why did they pick that town? lol
call one of those pipe line welders ask them how to fine a good paying job
Cornhole? What?
Striking similarities to a scene from "Office Space".
More like the business/HR trash are going to keep you waiting half an hour to  show you how busy and important they are. Followed by insulting and physically threatening you as soon as you walk in the room for wearing the wrong kind of suit, the wrong colour tie, or your socks don't match your tie. You try to have a civil, intelligent discussion with the sleaze about your skill, ability, and intelligence; and what they want to talk about is what kind of tree would you be and how well can you babble in corporate buzzword bingo. They want to physically assault you because you read, are good at math/science/computers, and look at those glasses: let's kill him.
Lol...
I feel like Babylon Bee has been waiting to do this sketch since the day they got banned from Twitter.
Brilliant! Wish I could give you 5 likes!
"Cornhole and Mimosas!"😊🤤  Endorsed by Homer Simpson
Who said Christians weren't funny?
I agree. I am curious who will hire these employees when they fled their old jobs because their boss informed them that they would have to be loyal, work hard and put in a few extra hours when needed.
What is it that you do here?
This needs a tv show. THE OFFICE, Twitter edition.
Time to get real she doesn't look like shes staving so whats the big deal
Why is this being recommended to me? I do not like this
Atleast they earn the momossa XD
Lol.....#omg
#WhenYouExtinctYourself 😵
twist is good in final .
Turns out a lot of Twitter employees are being hired up by the NSA. Really makes you think.
If people think millennials are bad in the workforce you just wait until gen z really gets in good lol.
Local kid (15ish) stormed out of McDonald's within an hour of starting because someone told him to put his phone down and do the work he was assigned.
i do believe that twitter employees did actually work, i think there were some workers that had more special accommodation, but there is no way everyone did that. now that i think about it, it prob was like this
AAH! HHHHHAAAAAAAA!!!     Love it Y'all!!
So yea, like... how do you suck dicks remotely, anyway?
kind of a remake of the A Millennial Job Interview that is actually funnier.
I though they would pull a black face on the dirty hands. I see a missed opportunity.
You know if another trades shop tried to poach me and they mentioned they had shrimp and rooftop cornhole sesh with mimosas I mean... I ain't marking that down as a negative....
i knew this would be cringey before i clicked. but it's all in fun. and pretty true
75% of Twitter employees just quit, so the problem is definitely the employees? Elon Musk is a joke and a complete idiot for DESTROYING a company in a week. NOBODY is going to work 80 hours a week in an office for no reason, without any additional pay. Stop supporting slave labor. You are on the wrong side of history.
I'd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work, and let me tell you something about T.P.S. reports.
I used to work fixing and cleaning apartments, it was fun. We used to drink our lunch behind the houses and bitch about the tenants. Good Times.
1:06 nice nod to office space there
Learn to code.
Twitter CVs will be flagged Before Elon and After Elon FACT
When satire is truth
That 3 month severance package isn't gonna go far!
WELCOME BACK BROTHER BEE!
The Right cant comedy
I think there is a role she should audition for.... the new version of the  musical, The Wizard of Oz is needing someone to play the witch.
why can't conservatives be funny?
I wonder if those Twitter employees that quit landed new jobs.  I imagine the pay, the work environment, the benefits and the ‘extras’ are a little less….generous than they were at Twitter.  Hope theyre sorry.
Afternoon cornhole session.  Rude and funny.
SNL is the cringiest, lib up UnFunny shit i've ever seen. HOW IS THIS WORST THAN SNL ?!?!?!
Hot damn...reality ain't it... 'remote' workers. Parag's fault for hiring globalized remote twitter police who don't know shit about real work. Evil Musk got them.
Your writing team wants to have sex with Elon so badly don't they

I love the office space reference😂
😂😂😂
Remember when the Bee did satire? This is the truth. I'm sure parents all over the country just lost their basements.
That actress does an airhead Tweep really well! 😄
Amusing indeed ! Many thanks to it depends on what is IS Bill Clinton for leading us into a service economy, what a wonderful work force some became !  Ha!!!
10,000% this is excactly how it will go down.. these twittiots will be in for a rude shock when they enter the real workforce.

They prob got a good payoff to leave Twitter so half of em prob won’t need to get a job for while to be honest, which is good cuz we won’t have to deal with them.
What to do now? The covid cheques, have dried up.
She needs to meet up with guy from Dirty Jobs next...
Channeling office space. Love it
The actress is fantastic
Lame and lazy, I’m sure the boomers love it.
yeah.. change the title to ex-twitter makes YouTube video's to pay the rent
Musk sure owned the libs by paying 42 billion dollars and then proceeding to lose most of his workers! He's not running the company into the ground at all! What a visionary genius!
Musk did the best thing. Let everyone to talk and have free speech!
As funny as this is, it’s TRUE!
Elon is a god
Let’s be real they screwed everything up with Covid, today our supposed president asked why are Americans bitch*ng other countries have it worst! Yes we are watching you destroy our country and you are misleading the hole country into Venezuela great. Just look at the useless jobs that CANNOT pay for the COST OF LIVING! Moronic bastard…..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm surprised she didnt cancel those Work-stuff-People for Black-hand.
Twitter has (had) ban specialists? 😂
Yeah I am getting the message.....😅
What a twit.
"Miss" ?? how dare you misgender "them, Ze, hir, It..."
How to dodge the bullet! Brilliant!
Genuinely funny!
Mister Musk needs to be even more richer! What a scumbag to fire so many people! But why not he never done any hard Labour in his life!
Hahahaha, good luck to them all in the real world......hmmmm there's always the Guardian
She's the modern day Maynard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzpQPDSr2s
if I had the opp to work with E Musk I would work AF fuck twitter employees fckn pussys
They may not have shrimp but they can get dirty AND have some alcohol in between work  Also ...waaaaaaaaaayy too many Millenial/Gen Z and modern women nowadays are deathly afraid of work.....women are surprisingly bad at customer service.....all the things that made the stereotypical housewife/woman great is completely gone in today's females....
I am hungry no more free pie during break time.
luv it!
This reminds me of the video made about Millenials at a job interview.....except now its Gen Z and its even worse....which was what I expected and feared....
Bartender , McDonald's worker :) cashier , oh boy I have so many suggestions
So good 😢😢
So basically twitter employees are forever unemployed
This is brilliant... so well thought out
Good job making fun of people for losing their jobs; not mean-spirited at all, are we?  Of course, given how many people are now _voluntarily_ walking out of Twitter, it seems that most Twitter employees are confident in their ability to find work elsewhere, so I guess this video is inaccurate as well as wrong-headed.
This is not realistic. Getting into and working at Twitter is hard
Many a true word spoken in jest. Most of them have never done a decent days work in their lives.
lmfao
In the real world, she will have to relinquish her esophagus🤖
The scary part is twerps like this are getting hired at normal companies.
LOLZ
Yeah, I'm thinking about looking for a new job too. I was always comfortable with my beneficial job, but my boss is...the boss type. Is it unwise to quit a really decent job to pick your hours because of ONE person you can't stand?
Thats what happens when you get lazy lol
😆
Should do one of hand on a Drilling rig
In the Biden administration
The Elon bootlicking club
This was the best!
🤣🤣🤣😍 Thank you, Babylon Bee. So good to have you back on Twitter & so glad to see some of humanity's worst gone, gone, gone.
You can get a good job in 3 months and leave this republican crazy elon musk in your rear view mirror.
Brilliant
Every tech companies firing : Oh recession Elon musk firing : BIGOT, EVIL , DEVIL !!!
You're a real piece of crap.
The hardcore engineers were there before then they hired these woke idiots for virtue signaling purposes. They just ride the coattails of real engineers. No one is missing them. The purge was bound to happen.
Why do you hate twitter employees?
Aww man the ending was gold🤣
Ha ha funny, they even has a recop free day off a month for stress. And today seen engineer and specialist had a travel account they have to report to their head to authority that expense.and one guys say the average is up to 1,500 and he knew some who had up to 4 k outstanding. Said they will sick as they have to pay the interest. But he dont know musk not honoring that expense account. They have to pay it off themself. Watch then sue. LOL
you nailed it again , funny as hell
Can you believe YouTube recommended this to me without me being subscribed? I am now subscribed and I am ashamed I did not have this remedied earlier!!
Comedy brought to you from a boomer republican. 🙄 I doubt ex-twitter employees will have a hard time getting a new job. Or they can just start a new company. Maybe a new social media company based on short messages.
Its funny cos its true.
He had black hands.
I hear they are paying 15 dollars an hour to place salt on french fries and mc dees. They are over paying for that skill she would fit right in.
It's Morgan and Kyle Mann
To be honest I'm more shocked that she ran away before addressing the fact that he assumed her gender. We have discovered the kryptonite my friends, and it's greasy hands!
Pretty sure she is trying to portray my cousins!
Ligma Johnson series on them trting to weasel their way in
What's confusing is that the Bee is supposed to be satire but this video is probably based on a true story lol
Lol, I love the irony in these comments. So much Elon bootlicking (HARD WORK, rah rah rah), despite the fact that these “entitled” brats help build a multibillion dollar company. I looked up Babylon Bee, and sure enough, they are part of the butthurt conservative ecosystem.  Go back to worrying about your bathrooms and other people’s genitals, lol. I’m so glad you guys had an underwhelming midterm.
Musk says 'Free speech' but you should pay for it? Is this a free country? Musk is a liar
Oh for crying out loud you run you your own website you know 1st hand that Sever Admins and web developers (you know the bulk of the people Musk fired on a whim like a moron who has no idea what he's doing) provide highly specialized and in demand work.   You literally cannot be this ignorant and stupid but you clearly think your audience is... 🙄 Jokes on them I guess...
I wouldnt hire any of them
Awesome vid
Haha  Twitter employees will live to regret their decision  Should have fired them all
Downloaded this. Because without a 'parody' label, it will be gone soon.
I mean, this is honestly probably how some of this worked.
I must confess I flinched at the mention of AA - though it really is people like whats-her-face who give the program a bad reputation.
Does this help explain why Twitter was losing $4 million a day?
Good piece 👍
She is a GREAT actress 🙂
Loved it!  Well done!
sorry couldn't watch even half.  kick her out now!
Time will tell if Twitter's staff are all useless and do nothing and Musk can sack the lot or they actually did do something and he will lose $43 million faster than anybody in history.
Perhaps a "corn hole sesh" doesn't mean what I think it does?
Brilliantly done! Progressive degenerates!
This was an Office Space tribute.
LOL Wow! Hilarious, although there are probably lots of "workers" out there who are wondering why this is funny.👍👍
If this is true we are gonna witness a lot of former twitter employees kicking the bucket in a few months.
She needs to go into politics
Haaa!  I got the reference at 1:05.
Bhaha this is exactly what I imagined when our news wrote that people are leaving Twitter. Also I was thinking that some people in Twitter might now be happy, that the comany got rid of dead wood.
😂😂😂 thanks kids
I luv it  !!!! Elon clean the trash liberals out of there fken scum of the earth lol
Nobody's living in my head  -  nobody.
That last bit was a cheeky one at Elon's Joe Rogan podcast 'light up'
The latins and greeks thought work was tortures, but different from twiter employs they where willing to go to war to uphold their societal order that citizens fight and talk while slaves work.
She can't hold a real job.
Good one guys. So true tho
women in the work force is literally responsible for the coddling and babying of employees we have been seeing in the last decade.  Change My Mind.
Former Twitter employees had to change their pronouns to WAS & WERE! BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!
Wow, the cope. Imagine licking Elon Musk crack just to learn that he is a complete moron. Sad.
Everybody knows working with computers isn't a real job  😆
"My afternoon Cornhole sesh"  LOL!!!
Go Elon…such a bawse!
I was expecting her to be triggered my "miss"
McDonald's has plenty of jobs available for woke Twitter libscum
i once knew a chick who literally went on a hissy fit when our boss told her to move 1-2 fairly light boxes of stuff! she claims "manual work" isn't part of her job scope i mean jeez...
"we don't have shrimp here"
LOL!!
He's a racist he in black hand ✋️
This is the truth! Remote working = 25% crapy work + 75% pretending to work, Alon is 100% right, they just got used to chilling and getting paid
Learn to weld :D
didn't Twitter once ban the hashtag #learntocode ?
Im sorry but she's too pretty to be a leftie.
It’s great to see all of those “Better than you” ass monkeys get fired.
Onlyfans for HER.
funny! But the millennial job interview video is still the classic.
50 years ago this would be a comic skit out of Monty Python . the tragedy is that today it is very real.
I dont think you guys have spoken to even one engineer from the software companies. This satire is wrong on so many levels.
Dialogue was partially copied from the movie "Office Space".
😂😂😂😂
Closest thing to twitter is probably politican
Next job: Snow Crash Cam Girl.
Adult Daycare....
Brilliant!
Great to get lost of a lot of idiots
Obviously a exceptional qualified individual to be elected as a liberal Democrat representative !!!
Remember when people dressed professionally for job interviews?
Yet age is still the basis for most hiring discrimination.
OMG LOL
rotfl
Fantastic.
"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"  Romans 3:23-24
ROFL!!! it's soo GREAT. In an age where comedy which isn't attached to ideology is viewed as "divisive" & "dangerous" it's superb to see the BeeBee continually pushing through the bs.  I would suggest Mandy should try to seek out a job assisting a farm vet with Bovine Rectal Examination. Would love to see a scene where she's oblivious to her surroundings because she is so engrossed in her mobile phone that she trips up and lands head first in the cow's 'Oh-No Hole' 😂
unemployment
Not your best work. Not very funny.
this was hilarious! 😂🤣
The flaw in this sketch is that she never would've showed up. She only does interviews on Zoom or TikTock.
Well, who wouldn't flee in disgust if they thought someone's hand was in blackface?
i legitimately believe this reality check is happening now to these incel basement dwellers. the harsh reality of life smacking them in the fact after thinking their first job after college was basically a frat party. elon knows exactly what he's doing and the liberal tears will wash the streets daily.
Enjoyable. Just discovered this channell
Nice Office Space references. 👏
Lets see, Twitter: a website where users interact with each other.. How many people do you need to oversee that?
Road Manager  (sleazy P.'s position ) for the Heavy metal Band Gwaaaaaarr
That skit is 100% reality of the Twitter toddler playground world. A world full of entitlement crybaby diaper-dapper 6 year old's that never did an honest and productive day's work in their useless lives. Twitter was a coddling mother goose for these spoiled brats. They never felt the weight of real work and responsibility since Twitter encourage laziness, procrastination, greed, immaturity, self-moralizing arrogance, and cultivated a parasitic and selfish environment.
2:45 : a black hand offense. You should be ashamed and canceled.
Laptop class BTFO'd
Yeah, there will be boatloads of these critters in the upcoming years.  BTW, congrats to being unbanned @ "the bird".
What would ya say ya did there? -bobs
great stuff
Babylon Bee is the (proverbial's) knees!!
this is so stupid
Walmart/ superstore 😂😂
Wheres her mask ? 😂
How very unfortunate but how very true
Fuck liberals
So sad but true.
When she saw the black hand I thought she was going to say blackface LOL
Good enough for them
So funny how they don't really do anything in there,I'm glad that Elon musk takes over the tweeter,now let's do some working like everybody else in the world ,like a real employee should do and not just sit there and do nothing..let this employees work for their salary,let them know what it's really like to work,even Elon musk work! and his a billionaire and he has a lot of schedule and appointment ! I'm so happy they got fired!!
Loved it !😀
Their handy number is over ha ha
Pretty ironic that this is getting posted to YouTube. All the commenters saying that these people should be getting real jobs when the exact same jobs are supporting there ability to comment on this platform.
Twitter employee applies for police department. Twitter employee applies for ranch hand job at cattle ranch. Twitter employee applies for farm hand at farm "what do you mean you grow food here, you don't just buy it from a grocery store?"
Brilliant!
excellent sarcasm , you guys deserves Nobel prize. Tear apart the fake jobs and bring the real job in limelight.
It’s about time these young idiot go get a labor job it’s called that for a reason I could not seat at a dam desk pecking on a key board
🤣🤣🤣
"I'm sorry we've decided to go in a different direction." Wow, the balls on her, treating the end of the interview like she was the one disqualifying him.
Are you guys sure this is satire? Looks pretty real to me.
Poor babies, there there.
All fun and games until you work in Corporate and know people EXACTLY like this - if not worse.
Learn to sell fries
If anything she undersells it.
:)))
This video actually does a really good job of showing why there's a labor/worker shortage.
Lol!  They are quoting Office Space!
Imagine working for “the babylon bee” and talking about how it’s actually software engineers who don’t have a real job
Yeah...those Twitter office twits reality is about to be broken
Actress is ON POINT
MIMOSAS
Is this real? Or is it just an exageration/parody of a Twitter employee?
They could learn to mine
Hope it hurts all the Twitter scum and vermin
She could be a homeless person and she can do as she pleases... I suggest she moves to Chicago.
Way too much reality in there for comfort....
please make more like this! lol
Parents worked hard so their children wouldn’t have to and guess what, they don’t! What’s funny is these kids actually think can take the reigns…😢
Only thing shes missing is a mask
Wine on tap lol the legendary line
years ago I made my first trip out west to California - it was there I encounter a "valley girl" talking to her mother in the gift shop at the National park - it was hard to interpret but I kind of understood part of the conversation -  I think the girl in this video may be her grand daughter.
Funny actress. But very scary she's spot on with these pampered, woke wankers.
hahaha those are so hilarious xD Love it
The scary part is that this isn't satire
I bet you have never even met a twitter employee.  Just like close minded Christians' to make fun of what they do not understand.  Next step is to pick up your swords if history is our marker.  Can't have those ex-twitter employees running around thinking different, better to call a holy crusade against them.
Free sushi every day and 10 hour work weeks violating our rights is over
I'm guessing you guys asked permission from Project Veritas before using their video, right?
Little late for Halloween horror now isn't it?
I guess this is what billions of money allows you to do.
She was scary good at her role. We're talking, Joker level delving into the minds of Twitter worker madness good here.
I hope all of these guys move back to their mom's garage.
Cornhole session???
I'm sure she will make a fine barista
Karma is a bitch
What's scary....there really are people like that out there....and they are getting more common.....
Nice Office Space reference 💪💪
Bring back Alex Jones
She thought she was applying for a gov job..all the same there too,..
Conservatives often think things they can't understand aren't real. They can't comprehend how computers work, so obviously, working on computers must not be a real job. But writing bad comedy? No, no, that's a real hardworking job.
😂
What is that god awful noise video un watch able
😄 that boss would make a good Captain Haddock
As soon as HE said MISS, I got scared... glad it was a follow up rather than a coffin nail.
Another masterpiece by the Babylon Bee.
So so funny!!!🤭
She is great at this role, hilarious stuff!
The hand lol
Rooftop cornhole sesh!?!
Loving the tears from all of you that girl will still make more money than y’all and do LESS work 😂😂😂
Yes this video is funny but sad at the same time because it is so true of the progressive left who I would bet never worked a real job.  They need to look at the bright side of this and now they will have more time to set at home smoking a couple of dozen joints or bowls and crying to their parents about the mean man that took over the company.
I didn't even watch what she said I didn't even watch the video all I could say is this woman deserves not to have a job PERIOD!
I wish this wasn't how everyone actually seems to view work these days.
Yea, Musk really did end the free lunch😊
Hardly a realistic interview at all in the REAL WORLD  in the real world, the moment this person started acting that way, the interviewer would have simply said “sorry, you aren’t what we are looking for, this interview is over, please see yourself out”  Only when they start getting treated that way will these “people” have any hope of one day potentially realising THEY ARE THE PROBLEM…
She could do AOC’s job.
I like the reference to the movie “Office Space “. “What would you say you did there?”
This is exactly what i imagined
Now that’s funny!
Too real to be honest lol
the way she recoiled when he said work....🤣🤣🤣😂
🤣🤣🤣
maybe because I'm old ; but wth is a 'cornhole sesh"?
They had real jobs. Do you? Get to work!
I remember that day when jack Dorsey blocked Trump now it’s a payback time sorry 😢
Hollywood needs to pick her up. She did a great job at this
It's funny at first, but you could make all the same jokes about lawyers and chiropractors. Tech workers that succeed actually put in the hours, and skip the vacations.
This coulda been funny. But it wasn’t. The actress sucks a lot
Is this Lena Paul's sister?
Sadly this is no longer satire.
Sadly this is probably very close to reality. Snowflakes gonna get a real shock.
Soooo true!
Waitresses are needed daily.
This actually is probably pretty accurate sadly.
This video triggered me. Im reporting it to the equally leftist censoring youtube
She can get a job for Biden.   No work required
Nice documentary.
He should hire her, he’s paying for her student loans anyway.
A really funny and on point video but much schadenfreude that all of Twitter is going to hell in a handbasket along with 44 billion bucks LOL.
This couldve been really good. Not sure why so much play was put on the difference between manual labor and intellectual labor. An organic chemist sitting around reading papers all day and running formulas may not be getting their hands dirty, but they are still working. Not at all saying ANY form of labor was being done by these employees at twitter... but they really pushed the "manual labor=real job" here.  Maybe babylon bee believes manual labor employees make up the bulk of their audience, who knows.  . A "real job" is simply a position held in a competitive field in which someone could potentially replace you at any moment. If you can go around eating donuts, meditating, and otherwise slacking off all day while keeping your job, then there probably isn't a whole lot of competition for your spot. In which case it is not a real job.
This was meme magic.
lot of butt hurt viewers living in basements getting their jollies off vicariously through some perceived  comeuppance.
1.9K ex-Twitter emloyess disliked this video 😄
Ah, right-wing "humor." Keep trying, guys, and maybe one day you'll understand comedy.
This is basically what's happening to our society!! Hopefully more large companies will get rid of the useless SNOWFLAKES! It's time to get back to REALITY!!
Fun Fact: Women in general prefer indoor, air-conditioned environments. That's why you'll probably never see a woman fixing your roof or powerlines. Women in high stress, dangerous jobs are like unicorns.
All these twits want to earn $195K a year wearing their jammies in Mom's basement clicking a mouse a few times a day as a moderator!!!  95% of Twitter's 7500 employees were not actual programmers but moderators who add zero value to the company!!!
Elon: "Kathie Griffin, Jorden Peterson & Babylon Bee have been reinstated."  Nice. 😎
These people are complaining that Elon took away their free food and now they have to pay for their food When their jobs are pretty much OVER PAID
Love the Office Space tribute.
This is most Millennials and Gen-Z.
Is it just me or have you guys gotten funnier since your Twitter ban? 😆
Nice office space reference!
Unfortunately this is our current future
This just proves that far right comedy is objectively terrible.
Tbh we should all be treated like Twitter employees at our job jobs.  Not the other way around.  These companies do nothing but steal from us.
I'm 47 years old, and know people like her who are MY age, or they were when they were younger. Some are STILL like that, though.🤣
Is this Lena Paul's sister?
Imagine thinking coding is easy lol
Hey at least she found AA at her last job
Elon Musk… cleaning up Twitter by firing one snowflake at a time. ❄️
Hahaha the gagging at the handshake got me XD
Once again, the right-wing conservatives prove they have no idea what comedy is.
I think her next job interview should be for a garbage collector, as that is what she did at Twitter, spew liberal garbage and this is a really good portrayal of a ex-Twitter employee!
☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️🥰🥰🥰 ★🤝☭#MAGAcommunism!🇺🇸 #FireTheAll! #LetTheThing(YouKnowTheThing)#SortThemOut!
Steve from Fruitport MI?  Yeah, that guy is bad news.
Not Steve!
don't worry senior twitter slackers, as long you will remember to put the cucumber last, MC Donald's will hire you
What goes around comes around. Truth silencer is now out of work. This is the end outcome.
😅😅😅
She should have had blue or purple hair to be more accurate.
Freaking Hilarious!
Fire all those woke employees !  Next Clean Out Facebook !  Remove Facebook's Lying Owner !
Hilarious b*******
Elon Musk *is* an evil billionaire... but don't get it confused. He laid off all those twitter employees because he has no clue what anyone does at the company, because Elon Musk has no understanding of internet technology, having had only a brief glimpse into the world of HTML2/apache/php from his zip2 project in the mid 90s. We're up to HTML5 and use content delivery networks today, and Elon *just* demonstrated in tweets (which he then deleted after twitter's own software fact-checked them) that he has no idea how the web works. He's just another rich kid that got elevated to success.  All of this "good work ethic" BS is the smoke and mirrors used by the wealthy to strip you of the money *you* earned. Keep eating it up, but while you're doing it at least try to look around and see who's getting fatter. It's the 21st century. Should technology have been making labor more or less difficult over the last hundred years? What's actually happened?
Not only , Twitter employees.   Also all lay off by Google, Amazon Facebook
This was genuinely brilliant.
Funny. Sadly this is all to true
Wokesters, take a long walk off a short pier. We won't miss you one bit!
Everyone like this should line up to be punched lol
1:04 Office Space - The Bobs reference
Well, in most states, if you are let go, you are eligible for unemployment benefits, if you quit you are not. Those who just up and quit of their own accord evidently didn't consider that.
Bit disappointed it didn't end with her threatening to bring a lawsuit but still very well done.
Let’s not overlook the fact that most of these entitled gen Z/millennials were raised by boomers and gen X. Boomers and Gen X overall failed as parents and bear some responsibility. Learn from them so you’ll know what not to do with your kids.
I didn't get the ending, but the rest was spot on.
That was the funniest thing I have seen in a long time. Thank you! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious !!
Fire those lazy bums from the tweeter.
You made it wrong. She wasn't overweight, doesn't have a pink hair, piercing, tattoos.
This is how you fight against liberalism:  use the wrong pronouns and the word *WORK*           this will trigger them into oblivion
hooker
"What was on his hand?!" "Uh, grease?" "No, I mean the weird thing around his finger? Whats that for?"
This is highly fictional.  In real life when she shows up 40 minutes late for an interview she gets rejected on sight.
Easy to talk shit about the tech people who maintain the platforms that you upload shit to talk shit on and have transformed your whole conception of reality. Unh but they didn’t “work hard”. This video is for fucking idiots.
You filter out nitwit applicants very easily by not pandering to them. Just ask them what they have achieved in their previous job(s)  and then VERIFY.
Lol
Comedians mocking other people for not having "real jobs" is hilarious. Carefull you don't choke on the irony.
😅 We want 3 free catered gourmet meals a day and free snacks all day long!!! I visited a certain IT company for training & it was like that. Free everything including alcohol in the food area all day long!?! They even have a special lounge with scotch & wine & such away from the foodies.
she aply to bordelo near her
haha! This gjrl was really good!  I have a client, hired a new employee and ended the week with full on FBI/ SWAT raid at his shop just to apprehend the guy! Turns out he was a top wanted fugitive!😆  My friend said, "its too bad, he actually worked!." 😂
Are they all going back to work for Brandon??? … 🤪
Bruh, I was raised digging holes, building fences, planting trees, laying tile, mowing acres of grass with a push behind mower…by the time I was an adult, work was something that gave me pride and made me feel accomplished. I could lose my job now and walk in just about any place with a long list of marketable skills and abilities. I can youtube just about anything and fix it including my car which I’ve done many times. I think this is why dads are important. All these kids raised by single moms who just threw tablets and phones at their kids are creating useless generations that are not capable of working hard and surviving on their own.
i would never hire a former twitter employee. they likely are frightened, woke, zombies that believe all the democrat/communist bullshit that is being piled on the american people. for sure she can't think on her own or make rational common sense decisions. former twitter employees are more likely to be liabilities than not. i say let those brain dead demons die off - we will all be better off.
Enjoy your food stamps, I support firing all Democrat liberals threw out the Americans... Next time be quite...
I guess  musk  did a good thing,
What would you say you did there? Lol.
the local supermarket is desperately looking for shelf-fillers !
Lol.... I just want to say to all those Twitter workers.... as an oilfield worker for the last 28 years.... you can all kiss my ass....
FUK’n kidZ‼️👀
You're very upset about twitter huh Adam 🤭
🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOL..
Is this supposed to be funny? I don't lean liberal or republican I find them both off putting
Yeah...enough of sitting in front of Twitter
😂
When Musk informed remaining "employees" they would have to WORK, well, that ended their career lives. Now, they are on to their welfare lives.
I jus got banned for a jabbs comment lol
Job interview- So why did you leave your last job? Ex twit- They wanted me to work.
I have a general notion of what HTLM5 is, my english is not so good. Would they finally hire me at Twetter?
Future Baristas
This is stereotyping, pretty much hate.
The great thing is they will de off quick and open up housing.
Why, bearing in mind that these Twitter employees tend to have been seen as so far to the left that they are incapable of rational thought, would anyone outside the environmental lobby employ them?
I'm at 48 seconds and don't know if I can make it through without my sides exploding.....!!!!  Saved!
1:04 Office Space Easter Egg
Was it legal for you to film this real-life interview with a hidden camera?
NEW: Employees who have criticized Elon Musks decision to "remove the milk bottles and employee binkie" from the break room has caused quite a controversy at Twitter HQ.  They're being told over email. "You're adults. No more diapers and rattles!"
haha great vid. i imagine thats hwo all those who got fired will be
Good right wing propaganda. :/
"What would you say you did there?" Shades of the Bob & Bob interviews in Office Space.
Has Elon Musk seen this? Someone with a Twitter account needs to send it to him.
To be fair, a rooftop cornhole game with mimosas does sound fun.
😂👍
LOL So true and realistic!!
hi retards, how is life in simp central haha
why deleting my comments, why so sensitive snowflakes
Office space references? In this economy? Nice!
This video is a 100% correct.
Yay cringy boomer humour! who tf wrote this? lol
Those people makes me sick and I hope all of them end up on the street!!!
The tragic thing is this skit is probably 100% spot on.
Oh, boo-hoo she has to work like every fucking body else in this world. Instead of pushing her agenda across the Twitter verse. I have absolutely zero sympathy for any of those Twitter pieces of shit.
This almost the same as https://youtu.be/Uo0KjdDJr1c
I'd like to think this is a satirical comedy sketch but unfortunately we know there are equally (and somehow even more) useless people out there behaving like her. She is totally believable so bravo on acting and painful accuracy. Ô_o
Please tweet your video
3:05 Completely unrealistic. Lefty bodies often come into direct contact with far grosser things than a mechanic’s stained hand. In real life, she would have been triggered for being called “Miss”.
No safe spaces either.
All those libs that worked at twitter are in for a rude awakening. It’s awesome, now they can experience what the majority of America are experiencing.
Had a blue hair try and get hired. I told him he would be responsible for using a push mower. He quit before i could get his i9 going.
I can’t imagine ANYONE wanting to hire a person like this in a responsible job!
Ohhh I got it !!!  Call keystone pipeline !  I think there hiring !!!!!
Twitter, a giant adult child daycare
just awesome! Next a local TV station!
Love it. As a 30 year blue collar worker, this isn’t far of an exaggeration really. This work from home-pecking on a keyboard now and again folks don’t know work. The newest college drones come out of the indoctrination grounds expecting to be treated as something they are not even close to. Respect is earned.  I say we start respecting blue collar folks. We are truly the ones that help make the world function..not the pencil pushes or keyboard peckers!
This isn’t just a twitter employee it’s every 20 something in the world.
Black"handing" is racist!
Its so fckng funny and its true.
Professional useless person with 10 years experience demanding 140k a year
"Learn to -code- coal"
She could apply for a job at McDonald's but she would never last because of her privileged past at Twitter, where  one would show up at the office only rarely and then would spend the day in the free cafeteria or health club. Doing actual work? What is that, the Twitter employees ask.
It's funny and tragic at the same time, because it's true.
Good luck Mr Musk the swamp runs deep.
Some people still don't believe it...that's the trick, trick...hilarious video though
I thought the hand was going to be a black hand reference
Twitter employee fights Musk and wins Twitter employee opens restaurant Twitter employee quits smoking Twitter employee commits suicide
Haha those people you made up sure are dumb and bad
If Twitter employee becomes Cardiac surgeon.
There's plenty of "dead wood" opportunity in the federal sector.  People who go on hourly breaks like it's their religion. "chit chat" for 15 20 minutes about their personal life, go to the bathroom, then get a drink a water, and maybe actually WORK 20 minutes of every hour during the day.  Watching bloated government in "action" is mind blowing.
For a second I thought she was also reacting with disgust to his wedding ring. "LIke, don't you know that marriage and having a family are forms of patriarchal oppression?"
Priceless!!!!
Ah yes content manager , the most superfluous job in the tech industry.  At least IT's and software engineers do actual work.
Learn to weld
Woke in real world
youtube recommended this to me  based youtube 🤣😂
They might as well have stayed. Twitter still sucks.
You know he banned pathetic
Enough of this. In my real life experience  I see my kids and the kids of my siblings excelling at calculus in high school, going to first rate colleges, and coming into the workforce with tremendous zeal and integrity. Enough with the culture wars. These kids are smart, driven and we are proud of them.
Serious question:  How far from truth is the narrative of this video?
What you Elon fanboys and girls don’t realize is that thanks to the COMPETENT leadership of President Joe Biden unemployment is the LOWEST in 50 years! Twitter employees can very easily find a much better job in no time at all working for a great company that’s not run by an incompetent, mentally deranged LUNATIC like Elon Musk! Elon is now begging employees to stay! Elon overpaid $44,000,000,000 for Twitter and rendered it WORTHLESS within just 2 weeks! Sheer ‘genius.’ Only Elon Musk could do that! Oops…   Duh…
Humans raise lions not sheep.
"What would you say it is ya did there?" Nice Office Space reference😉
Welcome back on twitter
И смех, и грех))
He said hand work boioioioioing. But in she would've said 3 words and he would've told her to get the fuck out of his office.
I thought the grease was going to be mistaken as blackface lol
Worse than pretend funny. Content moderation is really hard and requires higher level thinkers with strong language skills.
They need to do one with all the illegals with their green cards work visas from Pakistan and India controlling American politics
I say are you taking the micky out of us English chaps.
This was laughably bad! You know, you are more likely to be funny by being subtle. Look at the onion’s taliban videos. You could learn something
The lady was brilliant and the interviewer was superb in putting up a serious face without laughing out !! Keep them coming Bbee .. we love u 😅😅
This video cannot have more truth in it! Unfortunately these type of Gen Z kids are EVERYWHERE!  I live in LA (unfortunately) that everywhere I go, their they are, getting everything wrong, sadly!  And they all look so lost and so out of touch with reality, that they can’t no longer function like responsible adults!  I blame social media, the Catholic Church, Public Schools, Parents, The Kardashians, and all the dumb famous ppl! 😢
No more naps and Juice breaks
People loose jobs all the time and it doesn't make world news....it's an app and People act like it is the end of the world...boo hoo
Now only if they become hard working Americans again.  Instead of judge and jury.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The background noise is unbearable…
"What would you say...ya did there."
PURE GOLD☝️🤙👌👏
She should be a stripper. It's all she's good for.
If they try to work as they did in twitter they won't last long in any job .
"¿How do you get stuff done?" hahahahahahaha...dlfkjañsldkjfjahahahahaha
This is really cringe.
Clicked for cute Morgan
I liked the irony. I loved the ending. We all know the H1B visa slave labor is doing all the grunt work anyhow. Now back to my cornholing
Ending was funny
My 23 year old was taught work ethic as a youth and is now a Corporal in the Marine Corps after only 2 1/2 years...He thanks me often for giving him that drive.
All these tech companies hired activist kids with no job skills and gave them newly invented titles who then made demands of a feeble spineless management, bragged about hardly working and taking endless vacations. It’s great to see the pendulum swinging back.
Just wait till they find out all the other tech companies fired people too so they won't be hiring either 🤣
3:03 The interviewer assumed she was okay with the title 'Ms' 😆
just lol
I love that Musk does not have to weed out the poor workers because they are volunteering to leave on their own. Great job Elon!  You will be left with employees that want to excel and will likely be the ones that you will promote in the future after they prove there worth.
True..but these people things have a mental issue...technology 🙄 too much too soon makes u lazy...the best part my 23 year old son told me..yep got one living with me..HELP..little children spinning in circles..
its a damn shame Elon fired them all! how am i supposed to get banned for having a different opinion if heroes like Mandy aren't around to press a button?
Dont ever start video with such a horrible sound
I wonder if this is funny to anyone that isnt over 50.  Its just bad comedy, people like this dont exist.  On that note, its just sad how the older generation thinks that spending their entire lives building up the wealth of the ultra rich, destroying the economy, and destroying the planet is somehow ok. Is it actually suprising that now young people dont want to participate in the nightmare world that you created?
Accurate depiction.
How can I get a job at Twitter.  They definitely a better work place than most of the places I've worked during my lifetime.
Loved every second of it!
Right on 😀
imagine being banned on twitter lmao
Me thinketh hopefully they'll be lining up on the., unemployment line ith the rest of the.........Facestopo Fackcheckers!@!?😝🤪😜😉
Would be hilarious if it wasn't so true lol
WOW AMAZING HOW STUPID THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE
I wonder what all these Twitter employees are doing with their Teslas...
If you told them they were well trained little Marxists, they wouldn't know what you meant. They have been conditioned by California and NY public school systems.
Brilliant video. Well done 👍🏽
She  is  absolutely  unemploye able. I would  rather  higher  a 🐕
I heard Twitter was hiring again.
So funny
Great satire, thanks!
Look at all these stans for Elon. A mighty fine cult he is growing
Lmao @ 1:55 that's my reaction when I hear someone is in AA.
I love how people outside of tech, are using tech right now, to complain about how people in tech don't do anything. I work in one of the tech companies all of you think consists of drinking craft beer and playing ping pong all day. What my day is really like is 10 hours with no breaks, Mon - Fri. Sprinkle in 2-3 hours on Sat and Sun. I'm not saying my job is as grueling as brick laying, just that it isn't what people outside the industry think.
Hahahha
It's a job, job which is problem for her! LOL
I love how they’re quitting on their own volition because of nothing more than a strongly-worded memo; as if they’re inveighing against some injustice, but they’re not quite sure what that is.
Women☕️
they were busy banning republicans and conservatives ....like a true communist/ nazi ....they should have been sued.
Yes twitters previous atmosphere was FFFFUUUUCCCCCKKEEEEDDDD! Enough to make me actually hate my own culture. The US is absolutely DOOMED because this generation is by and large worthless. A few shining 🌟,but,this is way too close to the truth of the matter. Yes this is what it was like and even though I'm not totally a Elon fan I hope he either shreds and destroys Twitter and all the douches or opens it up to everyone. Even the nutjobs.
If you meet someone who works/worked at Twitter, you should get to PUNCH THEM in the FACE, once for free.
I like when our young useless “workers” get a dose of real life.
Great actress.
I'd use this Shiksa for scat
a good twist would have been that she banned him from twitter and he should somehow be grateful
this is just theatrics.
🤣🤣🤣
Todays democrats!
I thought she reached because he called her miss. I was expecting her to say she identified as a man...lol
Useless people rule.
Perfect.
Who are we kidding?  Ex-Twitter employees aren’t going to look for new jobs.  They are going to move back in with their parents, pop a bunch of anti-anxiety pills, then go back to school to earn yet another useless degree.
this is exactly what I think work at Twitter looked like, useless workforce
Awesome,funniest video i ve seen in awile!
I always have a soft spot for actors/actresses who can perfectly pull off unpleasant characters, and wow does this actress do it well
Actress was great
McDonald's is always hiring🤔
So epic!! 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Great stuff. Fuck those woke marxist ex-twitter employees, fuck them.
Wow this is painful to watch. Christian movie vibes. Awful, how do you guys have so many followers?
Fired Twitter Employee:  You don’t expect me to work, do you?  YOU FUCKING MISOGYNIST PIG!! Job Manager:  Leave this building now!  If I catch you back here again, I’ll have you arrested!!
Wtf this is funny
You should start looking fir your first real job too !
Weird, this is what I thought people that make lame Youtube videos would act like in the real world.
The tech companies were sponsoring legions of professional fifth columnists
This would be funny ... if it was not so tragically true 😢
LOL
That ending was so funny!
send her to Russia for 9 years for LABOR job.
It's going to get pretty difficult for these IDI@TS to find a job which offers free lunches!
I read the employee chat during Musks first zoom meeting with the employees. It was unbelievable. They made fun of him and asked ridiculously entitled questions. I hope every one of them is working at starbucks now.
lol. Love it.
I did see the video's of the restaurant and the food was very very good looking, and i why they want wine from a tap system, is that to hurry up the process ?
This appears to be a accurate account of the new age of America
😂😂😂
Rapture!
For The One's That Say She's A Good Actor.. You Mean Actress. 😹
This is what half of America expects to happen.
My father used to threaten me that if I didn't apply myself in school, I'd be one of those "dirt under the fingernails" people. I ended up being an electrical engineer in a steel mill. I often had dirty hands...  No problem, that's why they have soap!
Twitter employees are really like this I’m  So happy Mr Musk has it now
She can get a job at Microsoft media, then love censorship.
Only fans about to get a lot of new accounts nobody is willing to pay for
Hilarious! Outstanding!
Babylonian Bee?
Maybe these ex-Twitter employees should learn to code?
What a BS vid, are you saying all twitter employee's are lazy?  If that is the case this is stupidly insensitive when so many peps are losing there jobs because of a big twat!
San fransicko mayor may have said they would hire all fired employees of twitter.
Well that title explains why they didn't apply to work here, they need a real job.
Luvin' it!
#LearntoCoal
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG, i need the I GOT THE MIMOSAS image as a whatsapp sticker lol. Also, "i noticed you dont have any meditation rooms" LOL that's a 100% accurate observation some of these ex twitter employees would make (not out loud of course)
This describes EVERY Gen Z I've ever met... trigger words.....grow up
“What would say, it is, you do here?”
Funny 🤣
At 0:33 arm is clean but at 3:09 it's greased... What has happened during the interview?
This is Awesome 😎👍
Alright...who with Babylon Bee is from West MI? Fruitport MI is oddly specific.  I'm from Fruitport MI and Steve is my neighbor.
I cannot imagine the transition from 4 hours of work a week at the commune for 40 hours at a job.
This is so true
Nobody actually understands the problem here;  The problem is not that Twitter had fantastic working conditions and salaries,  The problem is that Twitter had fantastic working conditions and salaries because they were buying your soul.
As an employer interested in hireing someone new. Seeing Twitter as the last employment of their application, is going to be a big factor in my informing them, thank you, I'll be in touch. Have a nice day.
I think that about sums it up lol
Twatter before Elon Musk was an adult day care with soy latte parasites as the main workforce.
‘So what would you say…ya did there?’  They asked me a very similar question when I used to work at Initech.
God bless Elon!!!!
They can all work at Starbucks!
She can always be a onlyfans model
SMH.  Great comedy.  And very close to reality of today.  When interviewing an already established in the work force person seeking employment.  The must be asked question is always,  what has been your "achievements" with your last employment? All levels of employment can have an achievement.
So nice to see people comment on the skin of others, in any case the clip will also refer to a spoilt billionaire who went belly up by thinking he could change Twitter. “I had a car company that never turned a profit, I also ran a rocket company that never made a dollar profit and in the end I tokk over a social and managed to run it in the ground in less than a month”
why are people shitting on twitter employees? they do stuff otherwise twitter wouldn't be profiting xD
Facebook is hiring.  OMG, I think I used to know her.  She was a criminal lawyer in my town.
lol
The vocal fry and up-speak is beyond annoying.
Perfect!
Ah, ha ha. Real world meets metaverse. Bang.
That’s pretty unrealistic; he assumed gender and got away with it 🤔
2:49 Missed opportunity to say that he did black face
Hilarious!!!
this is some cringe content. Does anyone actually laugh at these sort of videos or just has ''yeah tell em'' rage fit while they feel a there childhood wonder chip away.
This would be funny if it wasn't true
Haha, did any military members notice the MRE in the background?!?
Walmart Greeter
That's GREAT! lol
So true!
His colonial patriarchial mansplaining rule triggered a passive aggressive response from the gender she identifies with this hour.
What’s a cornhole??
This is supposed to be over the top satire, it's worrying when the wall flowers that have been fired probably haven't done a days work in their lives...  You've got to wonder how YouTube is going to find room for them all, because that's effectively their only comparable employer...
Let's fire these Facebook clowns next!
Nope, nope, noooppp.
This is a perfect example of boomer humor
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂So true.
I hope all the former employees of twitter know this is exactly what we think of them and are laughing at them
Now do the FBI, could do a series. Could start off with any various secret testing on civilians. Lead into how the Killed a president, no questions asked. Lol, investigation report still classified says it all.
When I worked at a certain huge warehouse… the name I will not say, I was in the receiving department in the evenings. Most nights we would get 1 tractor trailer, 53 feet, to unload but sometimes it was two.   After a couple of years there, the general manager decided to retire. The next guy came in and oh Lordy… my manager got tossed. I tried to stay on but the CEO decided to “focus on the front end and a lot less on the back end”.   Well, receiving was told that we were not going to get any considerations. Next thing I knew, my team dwindled from 6 men, to five, four, then… it was just me to unload the trucks by myself…. I was told that it better get done or I was fired.   I walked away.   I wonder if they just stand there and holler at the trucks to unload themselves?
Ha ha ha ha hum ha hilarious.
😆
🤣😂🗝️🔥😁 beautiful I got them ha ha ha ha hah take me up he comes down 🤣😂🗝️🔥😁😂 love my king
Sadly this attitude trickles down to mainstream "work work" jobs. I work in a manufacturing plant and many of the new hires HAVE to drive their fork lifts off to hide, and play on their phones every 10 minutes or so.  When a piece of equipment goes down, they will sit on their fork lifts and stare at it, instead of getting off the lift and restarting it.  We currently employ about a third more people than 10 years ago, and get the same or a bit less work done.
Brilliant.
And coal miners should learn how to code. Useless eaters
One a da good ones! 🤓
Babylon Bee killing it yet again
Love this. AND hate this. It's too bad this is what employers have to choose from these days.. The USA is doomed I am afraid to say.
She didn’t ask for pronouns so she was definitely fake 😜
What really needs to happen to those leeches is they need to be treated like the parasites they really are. You don't keep a tick or leech alive after you've removed it from your body. Hopefully the mental illness will kick in real hard with them and they'll self cull.
that would be funny if it was not so true . awesome skit
While this is supposed to be a parody, this is actually the reality.
Ahh... Babylon Bee does it again. Nailed it. They have their  finger on the pulse of America! (BYOG) bless y'all!
As a new Twit… it’s s pleasure to watch the honorable Elon Musk run off the worthless employees that the previous management hired and trained. Hopefully most of them quit so he doesn’t have to fire them. Go Elon…🎉
Subway is hiring.
Is this actually what twitter employees are like? Can someone verify if they’ve seen people this stupid and behave in this way. I don’t what the culture is like at twitter but if it’s that bad then no wonder Elon is having a shake up.
That was great
Just hit the nail bang on the head  There is a real world out there this is what crippled the country fluffy made up jobs for the entitled (whoever they are)
Nice xDD
It's not fair to disrespect the dead 🤭 i mean woke
Thats pretty funny
Liberals are such deep losers.  WTF is wrong with these scum?  They suck the cornholes of politicians so they can get by for free.  Lazy, hypocritical LIARS who suck the life out of our culture.  GO TO HELL YOU SCUM!!!!
America failed miserably somewhere along the last 50 years. We have raised two entire generations of spoiled brats who think that the modern Society and all the things we enjoy within it just exists magically without any Human work going into building it.
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
I had someone turn up late for an interview, didn’t even bother to start the interview, pointed out late is not acceptable and went no further.
good for them, just send all the jobs to asia
Pretty much how it is.
What is a cornhole session? My understanding is that cornhole is American slang for bum hole so are they licking each others bum holes then sipping drinks? I mean, it fits but I'm not sure if that's what is intended here.
Awesome
1600 former twitter employees didn't approve of this video.
Trying so hard to be edgy and funny. Cringe
AHAHAHAHAHA
Same people who scream work is slavery......
Lol
Iesson n1, you don't ban the bee 😎
LOL you seriously toned it down. I saw a lady answering to an ex employee’s litany of “woe is me” tweets” with “come on, is not so bad, just keep applying for jobs, something will come up, you’ll get over it”. Guess what the guy’s answer to that was… LOL he just copied the FBI on her answer! He thought that her answer to his endless whining tweets warranted an FBI intervention!…. Straight up psychotic.
100% authentic Twitter ex-employee.
Absolutely nailed it! I'm just mad I didn't think of it first.
This is a parody but this is actually how twitter employees really are and how gen z have become a bunch of whinny babies
Maybe they can install solar panels?……
loved the office space nod
Your videos are excellent, because I really do despise the actors that portray these woke morons. Good job.
Love the sublte shout-out to "the Bobs" from Office Space.
Very accurate depiction 😂
Corn-hole is a game, they're not having gay sex.
This single video is enough for Babylon Bee to be restored on Twitter. 🐝😂
Congratulations. Standing by your ideals paid off and you are back on Twitter.
I'm glad to see those God hating socialist monsters leave Twitter - and they are also not welcome in Chillingbourne.
I already lost it when she said that schedules are an oppressive colonist regime. lol
Western Leftists have really interpreted Hindu culture like yoga, meditation, namaste, etc on another shitty Level.  Hats off to Babylon bee for representing it perfectly.😄😄
I can't watch this because she's so annoying. She's too good of an actress.
This is every interview for every person from twitter  and Facebook that left or got sacked. Welcome back to twotter
So good
I thought this was supposed to be a parody video, this is a documentary
“What would you say…ya did there”  Idk what she did there but I KNOW damn well what you just did. ELITE reference deserves a like.
Little too realistic for me bud....
Job Interview on Sunday
What would you say you did there? Lmao
😂😂😂
LMAO... so on point..
5,000 woke Libtards are about to get a taste of the REAL world!
Fabulous!!!!
She’s pretty much every useless liberal millennial ever.
Pipeline employees loving this!
lol
Get the fuck on.
I have nothing for both of you. Get the fuck on. Both of you have nothing to offer. Why are you still asking questions and licking buttholes prick.
@Elon Musk #ElonMusk
I'm impressed that you used an actual real life interview for this clip.
is Morgan single cause I'm interested
She’s a good actor. “How do you get any work...” and she responds with an aggressive pulling back. Well done
WHY TF DID I NOT KNOW Y’ALL HAD A YT CHANNEL…
The fact that conservatives think some of the most accomplished and sought-after IT specialists and coders in the business are just hippy Starbucks baristas just goes to show how warped by ignorance and hatred the right wing mindset is.
I'm so glad my two millieniels on how to work.
Typical modern worker, entitled and arrogant
🤣🤣🤣🙃 so true.
I still will not get over "Cornhole session", it *DOES NOT* sound like a backyard game you play in polite company...
😂😂😂 people celebrated the "death" of Tumblr until Tumblr people came to Twitter. These guys are going to work at your favorite site next
1:05 Office Space!  Awesome!
From quietly quitting to quick quitting 😳
oh dang i remember morgan from twitter like 5 years ago - glad she's workin with BB
You can throw up on me baybuh...
BB stoped making light comedy clip, now they record live events :)
She’s kinda hot.
Lol do we even have any proof that all/most/if any of the fired employees are like some dumb privileged libtard who wants easy life other than the word of the guy who fired them?
Imagine burning thousands of calories every day doing your extremely dangerous job (timber falling) for years & years, only to see that the country is being handed to THESE clowns..  That doesn't happen naturally..... That DOES NOT HAPPEN NATURALLY....
I can't describe how much I hate every last piece of shit censor at Twitter, or any other social media platform, and I really can't describe how much I'd love to meet one on the street some day. Fuck every last one of them. I hope every last one of them never has the ability to find a job that pays a living wage ever again. Fuck those motherfuckers.
thought lib humour was gay, turns out it's just american humour in general
What???!!! No EGO MASSEURS???!!!
This very website youtube is staffed with liberal programmers enabling LOW IQ republicans such as yourself to use liberal technology to spread your low IQ message.
I remember when Babylon Bee used to be satirical, now it's the only trustworthy news source
This is a ridiculous parody of what happens at tech firms!
You mean I cant just stay at home shadow banning conservatives all day?   This economy really has fallen.
Starbucks nexts
I think Twitter “ employees” will have hard time to be hired again by serious organizations or companies. They got bad reputation now.
I need 4 workers that can identify as Ford cortina tyres… must be flexible and willing to travel… p.s. mot is in 2 weeks
Can you guys tell me how exactly did they work before Elon bought twitter? Is it that bad or is this just IT employee meme?
Thank you Elon.  These flakes deserved to get fired.  Lazy snowflakes.  Go get $14 an hour to handle other peoples waste.  Or less.  Enjoy having to actually do something
Pack them up head em out is what Elon Musk is doing. He’s not going to deal with woke bullshit. He’s a workaholic and he expect that out of his employees.
Sad that this isn't even parody
I left not knowing for sure what the cornhole sesh really is. At first I searched the gutter, but at the end I questioned my depravity.
Haha nice reference to Office Space 1:05
This is the most bootlicker ass comment section I’ve ever seen maybe if yall would look up at the guy you’re sucking off you’d see how this “genius capitalist” turned a 44 billion dollar company to a 10 billion dollar one in under a month and its looking like twitter might even file for bankruptcy. go find a new idol to worship this dudes a fucking loser
Hard to believe any Twitter employee is representative of this. How much did Elon pay you to make this video?
Must be so satisfying to finally take a piss at the bich from twitter who blocked you
Welcome back to Twitter and God bless Elon Musk!
As the Journalist profession helpfully told us so many years ago: sucks for you: learn to code.
Hilarious and on point as always gang! Keep doing what you are doing and keep having fun. Oh, and what the heck is a mimosa?
Oh wait, this isn't real?!?! 😮
In reality those employees leaving twitter are competent and will almost all land on their feet with similar salaries elsewhere. No reason for them to become "hardcore" for the same pay at twitter b/c a billionaire told them to.
Don’t worry guys.   I’m already making “Learn to Code” memes for Twitter’s Software Engineers.
Useless weeks high on a power trip finally getting thrown out from behind their keyboards. Good luck carrying a conversation with people face to face without acting like you would behind your screen.
Babylon Bee in the top 20 trending. They must of gave up on Christian life and bought a devil pact
Maan, Babylon Bee makes some pretty dogshit content but this one, this one’s just terrible. It speaks to the absolute contempt at the hearts of the people who wrote, filmed, and uploaded it, as well as those in the comments who thoughtlessly belittle these people as well as, curiously, countless others who work jobs that are crucial to the world’s infrastructure and to our livelihoods. It’s a damn fucking shame, for real.
Twitter mass layoffs caused the biggest case of schadenfreude  I have ever seen.
Blue collar vs white collar job clash while the bosses laugh at everyone.
Oh I know, Mandy should be an abortion activists!
Twitter to Qwitter 👏👏👏
Man I wish I could’ve milked that while it lasted 😢
We used to het made fun of for making fun of giving participation trophies. Here's your results
Brilliant. It's funny bc it's true
💪😎👍
LMAO those twitheads sure did love CORNHOLE
McDonald's, and burger   king are going to run out of applications soon with all the rainbow people from twitter applying for a job.
As you can see, this is fake.
Jesus said in > (John 10:10 > The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.)  (John 14:6 > Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.)  (Romans 10:9-10 > [9]-that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. [10]-For with the heart one believes to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.)  So even if you have walked away from God, for whatever reason, that is between you and Him, but I'm telling you now that He > (Jesus) has never left you! He loves you and has been there awaiting your return.  (Luke 15:1-7 > "Parable of the Lost Sheep", Luke 15:8-10 > "Parable of the Lost Coin", Luke 15:11-32 > "Parable of the Lost Son")  (2 Peter 3:9 > The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.)  Jesus will welcome you with open arms. Amen!
Keep it up
It's good but at the same time I feel bad for those workers who has to lose there job in such a bad way. Email in your computer like they are a robot. But good video nonetheless.
the accuracy of this video is scary.
I just don't understand how working at Twitter was so hard to make employees walk out.
What I learned from a good friend who works in the Tech industry.....you better learn to save your money!
These are the kids needing mental health days because they can’t cope with a moderate amount of stress. 😂
Someone needs to explain to me what a "real job" is.
Cornhole is called “bags” in my neck of the woods. Cornhole has a whole different meaning. 👀
99% of the ppl defending Elon aren't smart enough to do the job of the ppl who were fired/quit.. I'll bet it'll take less time to learn your job then the other way around
why no one wants to hire women in general, this is fundamentally the sentiment they have
Love it
Looks like this was written by a boomer. Lol
The fact Twitter means so much to society is really sad. Facebook and Twitter are children's toys to stay up with the next trend.  Grow up everyone. You are adults who cry because they can't put thier every thought for everyone to see. Think about that. Wow
This is probably very accurate. LOL
When I was a teenager, a long time ago, tossing a bean bag through a hole was called "bean bag toss".  Corn hole was sticking your ...... well, never mind. I don't think the modern generation could handle the pronouns.
That was funny
Coke nose 👃
Lol they are gonna have a hard time in the real world.well.maybe meta will hire them .oh wait,hahahaha
I would say this video aged poorly, but considering when it was posted, I have no idea why you thought this would make conservatives look like the intelligent ones.
10 out of 10
Everyone knows cornhole also means gay sex right?
xD
Freaking flawless. Freaked me out. *It was real: that's what freaked me out.* Are there really that many oxygen thieves out there!!
this is so terrifying 😂
😂🤣😂😂priceless
Employer: How do you get any stuff done? Ex-Twitter Interviewee: I was a manager, I hire people to get the stuff done.
Jokes Aside, there are infinite tech companies with infinite tech jobs, Most of em will be getting a raise in future jobs..
Caught the office space reference you slid in there ❤️
When I was a kid cornhole meant something else
Well disability payouts are going to go sky high due to all the PTSD cases about to be filed.
Oh no....WORK!!!!😮
Makes me soooo happy 😃
A lot of young people think that being at work equals doing work. They are useless. If they pretend to work, we should therefore pretend to pay them, too.
Hiring Managers after seeing Twitter as your last employer: Yeah.....umm....... hard pass!
What is a "cornhole" sesh?  Is it to do with sodomy?
The end. The end where you showed how insane it would be for regular jobs to be like the tech jobs. That, was great.
Lol AA is such a joke
Sounds about right
I love it 🙌😂😂 ..👏
Lol
Elon & Cheeto’s excellent insurrection. Vladimir has bestowed the honor of most double crossing my minion to the bigly Tesla border wall pogues. E&C here’s to a penal love hack in Mara lago.
This is pretty emblematic of an entire generation actually
Get in your padded room little baby I love this thing that’s happening in the world today to the kids
😂 seeeee yaaaaaaa
Not even gonna watch this video, (because I know it's definitely not worth it), but I just want to say that these ex-twitter employees could probably do your job better than you. Keenan Thompson is funnier than you, and I hate him.
Came to laugh at some of u, now I have less faith in the future
Didn't Musk give everyone a choice and they chose to leave?
Be careful with your words.  The proper term now for "adults" is post-puberty people.
Yeah, I worked as a composite Technician at SpaceX completely impressed with the fact I was working for Elon Musk. I worked for 2 years, about 60 to 70 hours a week for the company, inspired by its goals. Made alot of money in overtime, which would then be taxed to a point that it was almost not worth it.  Saved some money as I had no time for myself to spend it. I remember one of the managers who I am friendly with, and who always seemed to be a good friend of Elon walk to me on a Saturday wearing casual clothes and makes the statement, " You need that extra money, huh?" I packed up that day, and completely stopped working overtime regardless of the threats made by management and looked for another job. I work a 8 to 4 now, which is the hours I se for myself to spend more time with the kids. Often from home making good money with no overtime as a business analyst. And I have my little side composite fabricating I do for fun and a little profit. I regret killing myself for someone else's dream.
priceless
Might be funny if it weren't true
Perfectly show what is the trash of human society hahaha 🤣 absolutely perfect
Sooo hilarious 🤣...not far from the truth I'm willing to bet....those liberal weenies are a lost generation because they grew up in a unrealistic non-competitive environment where EVERYONE gets a trophy just for showing up...is it a real surprise that foreign students and people their own age are far more accomplished than the crybabies we've nurtured here 😭(waaaaah)....
Get rid of as many as possible.  May they find a cliff to step off...
wait, what is a cornhole ses?
Gold ending. Love it.
I love this. A whole generation of marshmallows getting a big spoon full of suck it. Please, God that I don't believe in for anything but Old Testament sh*t, keep the fun coming.  Amen
No jokes about Elon blowing this up? These actors are terrible. Comedy for inbreds
This might be unpopular here but Twitter employees are actually pretty competent at least the engineers. Idk about all the other HR and content moderator types lol
I believed her to be a ex twitter employee
When a depression sets in, they will be the ones eating bugs.
This sucks, what boomer wrote this?
Cornhole pro...this gen is doomed 😳
A real job like working for The Babylon Bee?
I went to college at night and worked during the day. When I graduated, I was able to get a decent position as a software support engineer. I was a little shocked that most of my coworkers had never done any manual labor, flipped a burger, changed a tire, or mopped a floor. They were shocked that I worked on my own car.
Damn lots of Elon's co*ksuckers
You nailed that to a tee!!! (I’m surprised she didn’t ask for her non-winning, participation award before she left.)
Twitter employés got what they deserve.
Imagine having a job where if someone says "the border is not secure," you censor them. The degradation by these people is criminal at best, and strongly deserving of hell.
Why Steve from fruitport tho?
BB:  what exactly would you say,  she does at your company?!?!?  Elon:  Nagana work here anymore!
Oh this is part of a documentary
Well done!
So…. now this channel is making Elon Musk propaganda to help billionaires enslave poor people?????
Oh god, this was boomer humor to the max. The only part that actually got a laugh out of me was the end, where they subverted the entire joke ngl. I usually like Babylon Bee's headlines but this skit was pretty awful.
Seems like propaganda Musk paid to have made. Musk has a history of forcing you to work overtime and holidays without paying you over 40 hours. He just stiffed all the construction workers who built his newest Texas factory. Look it up
This is so sad and true that it’s so great.
100%
Cornhole sesh lmfao 🤣
so lets get this straight...  you guys think that being a PR manager, software or hardware engineer are... not jobs? As someone who commonly fiddles with programming and code, that is disheartening to hear. YouTube runs off of these types of people, too... are they jobless? Why must the things you people (The right wing) disagree with not be "real"? Another example, Reddit, has software and hardware engineers that must keep the site running. Whilst Reddit may not be... well, upstanding at times, it is still a good source for information, and hell if not that, then just for some laughs. If these weren't considered "real jobs", you guys would not be sitting here laughing at others.  Again, I will provide another example, FaceBook. If people were not considered employed when they are in charge of marketing, engineering and PR, could it even exist? Short and simple answer: No. 99% of what you snowflake boomers consume is on your phone, which is produced by engineers packing more and more data processing power into that tiny little device.  Now, grow up and stop being dumb. Again, most of what you use requires these types of people to run sufficiently without bugs or slowdowns, they work day and night to fix servers, scour for glitches and fix them for you, and you treat these jobs as if they are nothing? The ignorance and blatant disregard for your own logic leads to your downfall. Apply this same logic to YouTube; dozens of people get laid off from this service, and you are left without this "comedy" because of the misuse of workers. Whether you like it or not, these jobs are fundamental for holding up the internet as we know it today.  Get off your high-horse and find something more sensible to cry about, right-wing snowflakes.
Ummm Twitter employees would do things like tech engineering, marketing, policy analysis, backend software monitoring. Let’s not diminish their employment because you’re not familiar with certain positions.
Glad you guys got your twitter account back!
Those entitled libtards worked 4 hours a week, then criticized our society as a capitalist failure….welcome to reality scumbags 😂
Maybe they'll play a little game of rooftop foosball too.
Stupid
Making fun of people who lost their jobs is peak comedy 😂😂😂 Some will likely end up homeless; soooo funny lololol Babylon Bee never misses
Finally... My fast food orders are gonna be twice as fast.
This is the Age of Enlightenment—- Wake up  Woke folk!!!
I though she was going to accuse him of wearing blackface
He gave em 3 months severance pay...you can support them by tipping at your local Starbucks in February.
Corn-hole from where i am from means arsehole, so these people play with their arseholes while drunk???
She can be retrained to make solar panels for minimum wage. How do you like that cupcake?
Hahaha...bout time they sought the meaning of work. Lots of companies are not going to hire because you worked for twitter. I wouldn't hire anyone that used to work there. I don't want your hatred coming to my company.
Lmfao.
Yasss
Yeah work from home us just code for siitin your lazy ass home watching TV all day.
Jerry Falwell is no longer with us, I heard him say there are those of us who won't make it because they think manual labor is the president of Mexico.
I’m shocked that this managed to get on the trending tab. This is a good thing.
Not Steve!
She can unload trucks. That's what I do.
A tesla bot took my job
I asked the guy that did the hiring at this one electrical company why they hired a couple of slackers recently and he said over the last few weeks he interviewed 30 guys and hired four. They were supposed to come in on Monday, only two showed up.
Accurate
Yes I also like the sign McDonald's saying that they will hire Twitter employees if they looked at this they would think twice even though I know it's a parody it's fucking funny
what makes a job more real than another if you're getting paid that's real work lmao
None of these f****** they should never work again
Would.
Good luck out there failed Twitter employee
We ain’t gonna talk about that osha violations sitting against the wall!?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  God bless and welcome back to Twitter gents (though, I never used it to begin with lol).
This is the result of corporations hiring and promoting college graduates, over those with decades of experience in their field. We need to start prioritizing training programs, and certifications over college. College is ran by a bunch of people that have no experience in the real world, outside of school.  I understand that education is important, but college is not the only place to get an education. College will never be able to be a proper substitute for actual experience, especially when it is taught by people with no real world experience.  Maybe they should start replacing some of the professors, with people that actually have made a living in that field.
One, I don't think a Twitter content moderator specialist would apply for a job working on a manufacturing floor.  Two, how did she make her resume to look like something that a manager at this factory to want to interview her and not throw the resume out at the get go?  Three, that manufacturing manager was awfully mindful to not wanting to trigger the interviewee.
Lol
#LearnToWeld
People really going out of their way to defend elon's bad decisions
One of my electrician co-workers kept getting caught by the boss goofing off on his phone. I tried to warn him about it. His timing was terrible and a couple of days later he pulled out his phone, the boss came around the corner, and he got fired on the spot. some people you just can't reach.
Why does this shit channel keep popping up in my suggestions. Jebus.
This is not only people from Twitter nowadays.
#learn2weld 🤣🤣
Just shows how screwed up America is..We actually put all this energy into a dumba!# thing like Twitter..Get a life people..
The joke is on Elon
I hope none of these idiots get jobs in my city!
Like Biden said all those coders can just learn to coal mine. No wait....
These aren't funny. And overacting by definition. Thats why they are on youtube though and not in hollywood. 😉
No ok sign while wearing black hand? I'm so disappointed in you. You can do better.
I'm sure Twitter employees played tons of "Corn Hole"
Lol I love the truth
You had a good job but you blew it
Lmao to think some really thought that content moderation was a real job😂😂
Hahahhhaaaahahaaaa
Fire every woke female from your business, customers will reward you!
Check online for Professional  Hall Monitor and CRap Weasel.
Hey now, some of us Non-Lib kooks want remote work too!
🤣🤣🤣
Oh no!!!  Not Steve!!!
sad but this is so true
Praise God!!
Is this supposed to be funny? Why is this trash in trending?
Was worried this was an actual documentary of someone before I clicked and was upset.
Honestly didn’t know much about twitter until President Trump. Lost any interest when he was kicked off.
I don't get the joke. It seems like more millennial bashing, which is totally a boomer thing. If the joke is that half of Twitter staff didn't do anything, you should contact the Twitter communications department to ask them if that's accurate, oh wait. This entire sketch could be "Millennial white collar worker (that we don't like) applies for blue collar job". Boring, derivative, and predictable.
I think it's funny how many Republicans always talk about how important it is to work, and keep jobs. But when it comes to people they perceive as being liberals, they can laugh about it. I've been watching this all closely, and it's pretty obvious that people just make assumptions that their jobs don't matter because it's not something they understand. Trying to understand the reasoning here. Don't get me wrong, the Democrats are just as silly.
Good timing as job market is strong and willing to take "anyone" LOL
Hahahahaha🔥🔥🔥🔥
Being conservative is all about making stuff up about people then hating them for it.
I love the 'Office Space' phrase; "So what would you saaayyy... ya did there?" ROTFFLMMAO!!!!😂
😁😆😅🤣
I really want to see a docu series on how hard these idiots are about to hit the brick wall of reality.  It will be hysterical.
I lost it @ "what is that on his hands?!!!" 😂😂😂😭🤣
Twitter must be worthless garbage.  I wonder what kind of idiot would pay $44 dollars for it; much less $44 BILLION!
1200 ghey fbi agetnts just quit at twitter
Twitter employees that just got fired are like fish out of water rn. They’re lost
I thought she was gonna get mad about the mechanic doing "black hand"
lol, welcome to the real world
Goddamn, you know that feeling you get when someone runs nails against a chalkboard?  This is that.
That employer was lucky to have her leave.... Now if we can just get them to leave the planet we would all be better off!
Haha this was great! 😂
The way she smiles so proud to be 20 minutes late was so hilarious.
Thanks Elon for giving all these losers a chance to go hide in mommies and daddy’s basement again !!
Oh man. Having her as a coworker would be an absolute nightmare.
Hysterical. Congrats getting back on Twitter. But, who'd want to be on Twitter anyway?
Oh poor poor baby. Maybe Biden will give you job loss forgiveness.
Not far from reality
I believe there will be a lot of this going on. Dumbass ex-twitter emps.
Unfortunately, even if this was real, someone would still give that woman a job.
Hilarious. I'll be working from 10a-10p or later in a physically demanding job tomorrow. I'm 50.
Sounds about right 😌
wait till all those fired twitter morons have to get actual real jobs, wow wont they be in for a shock?
.... coding is not a real job?
Conservatives have 0 ability to be funny.
my roommate is like that...she wants that her Boss is thankfull that she comes most of the time to work...and only need like 2 month of the year as special me time and mental Regeneration...her dady is rich but only pays her rent food and a bit extra so she needs also to work...he destroys her live ....and is a monster...ah and all man are responsible for everything bad
It is funny and the woke people who worked there deserve it. BUT as a developer myself, trust me, it isnt easy lol they definetly work, developers in general. but they were using their jobs to do the wrong thing, censorship etc
Love the Office Space reference.
I was going to suggest fast food or maybe janitorial/housekeeping but I don't think her previous Twitter job prepared her for any type of meaningful employment.
Democrat
Gold lol
Oh wow. This was retarded. Is this satire or something with a deeper meaning? Like it was written by 12 year olds
Top tier comedy 🥇
Kicking out a bunch of losers from Twitter has been the most beautiful thing that happened in 2022. Thanks Mr. Musk.
Office Space call back. A little one, but its there.
Channeling The Bobs @1:06 FTW!
I’ve witnessed better comedy at a house fire.
Starbucks  is going to have a huge workforce  to hire from. 😆
Go with your fellow FEMINIST and work at TWAT-TER
Is this an undercover Project Veritas video?
Office Space vibes.
My generation fucked up these kids.    Wanted to be friends instead of parents.   Horrible.
Hahahaha fantastic
OSHA would have a field day with that skid propped up on the wall 💀
Wait… twitter has employees?
Lol
i thought this story was crazy. "people complaining and quitting because they actually have to come to work and actually work"
She gets 2 min a day at 1 dollar an hr
Twitter is/was part of the state media; the government used the platform to control the false narratives it created, limiting free speech and out right banding any truths that would reveal their corruption.  The employees that worked there were mostly for show to make it appear to be a real business.  It’s main revenue source came from the government—unbeknownst to the American people and to many of the actual Twitter employees.
Loooooooooool
Shout out to Fruitport, MI
Loooollll! If this wasn’t so accurate, it would be scary..
Wow!
was it really that non challenging at twitter?
Yeah this is spot on.
I couldn’t tell if she was barfing at him callingher miss or the grease on his hands😂
Poor poor snowflake !
Yeah its only funny cause its true!!!
CRYSTAL GENERATIONS FOR END TIMES TRIBULATION! THE WORST COMBINATION, LORD HAVE MERCY ON US.
Very realistic!

tone deaf crap for tone deaf retards
Ex Twitter employee applies for a job at the Slaughterhouse
Twitter employees don't play corn hole. But they do play with each others.
That was a liberal, not a twitter employee... or maybe one of those Trump republicans
Rename snowflakes to Tech flakes
We dont want Twitter to be just right wing, we want it to be fair game. Not just left media bs. We welcome all!!
🤣🤣🤣
They need to join the circus and be clowns !!
All the Trump blue collar bozos with no money are thrilled about coders being fired
go woke , go hungry......thats the future for these people.
False, Twitter employee would have a mental breakdown if someone called her a “miss” for not using her proper pronouns
Idk why people expect to be great but not to work hard. It’s a weird thing that’s happened over the last 20 years.
Amazing!😂
Before I retired in 2021 I actually had a young coworker that was very much like that. Always came to work at least an hour late and once she arrived the first thing she would do was order Uber Eats so she could have breakfast. I always thought you were supposed to have breakfast on your own time before you drive to work.
About a billion years ago in "logistics" we had contracts delivering bulky, large containers of clothing to mall stores. We didn't make any money on it; in fact, lost money both as drivers and as the company. I'd have to move the racks of clothing as the peach bums were on the phone (obviously a personal call) and wouldn't/didn't move. then I'd move all the racks back in place, being careful not to get the warehouse dust on the usual white/blue garb. One day (rare, very rare) a lady manager visiting pulled me aside and asked why all the OTHER drivers were so grumpy. I 'splained the above, but noted that if WE ASKED the peach bum to do ANYTHING she'd call HO or just ignore us. It was "all about her". TODAY///?? An entire GENERATIOIN is like that. It began in the schools: friends kids are telling me what's being said in class. I can't believe it.
Coming here from Mexico…I understand why 90% of my fellow Americans observe the average Twitter employee, like they’re an alien species.  That useless lifestyle/mindset is so foreign to me and everyone I know in my town, that I wouldn’t believe it was REAL, if I hadn’t actually run into a couple of them “in the wild,” myself.  🤨
I hope Elon watches this awesome video! 😅
The sad part is, all those useless Twitter husks will go on to enjoy grossly overpaid, easy jobs at some other tech firm.  No one ever said life was fair but this is ridiculous.
What are they going to put on their resumes censorship skills
A job is a job. Someone like the mechanic gets fired and will be just as “useless” in an IT job. Find something better to criticize
Who is Steve from Fruitport, MI? I’m from Fruitport!
I feel embarrassed for the people involved in making this.
BB forgot that she should have pink hair and a ring through every spare flap of skin.
Epic ending sesh!
Good ol' Office Space reference. Also, I've definitely worked jobs where I recognized that I wouldn't have a good answer to that question......
🤣🤣🤣 I've actually worked with people like this. I'm from Los Angeles so that says it all.
Babylon Bee use to be satire, now it's just reality.
Baristas and gas station attendants Ave to be there and do something.
Bhahahahaha
Funny but true.
I am, like, soooo in-love with Mandy.
I thought this was supposed to be satire, and not real life!  I love the very subtle Office Space reference.  Nice!
Having Twitter on your CV will have the same effect as having Evergreen State College on it, the applications will go straight into the waste basket, unless you were part of the software team holding Twitter together.
At "engages in manual labor" I cracked my diaphragm
Congratulations on breaking free from Twitter jail.
where I work the boss man used to turn down applicants right and left. Now he hires the dregs of society just to fill the schedule. Many coworkers probably think I'm aloof but truth is I have no respect for people who don't pull their own weight, so I ignore them
Painfully accurate… wild times!
What is a cornhole sesh?  The only definition of corn hole I'm aware of is the  Beavis and Butthead definition.
54 0.54
Welcome back to Twitter!
Classic obnoxious l ibtard White woman with horse teeth. Hilarious how the big tech woke HR c ommies have no understanding of or tolerance for the actual working class factory plebes.
BYOG rofl
Ask Mike Rowe. That's exactly what the woke are like.  The shutting down of the country for two years has totally destroyed our economy. I guess the feds made it ok though. Cause out of the million that died over 700,000 of them were on the social security budget. So they have that going for them i guess.
Why would a white collar tech specialist / Content moderator be applying for a job at a car repair shop?
I caught that office space reference @ 1:06 haha
Was this video sponsored by Elon Musk? All the twitter employees who don’t want to work 80 hours BABIES 😂😂😂
You guys know how bad they’re work conditions were right? They were overworked with almost no breaks Jesus Christ
😂😂😂😂
Boo Hoo ! I am crying violently ! Twitter "workers" might have to get a job and work for a living.
The end was funny. Best part about tradework is we work hard, but when the time is right we play hard. Like those ironworker guys from that episode of The Simpsons ;-)
The irony is that is from Youtube content creators.
"AA is for quitters" Bubba J
Us older folk are worth WAY more lately.
😀😀😀
Good sassy slap to the Twits! FYI: I'm over 60 and CORNHOLE meant something way diff.
I hope all the fired EX-TWITer employees starve and die homeless on the streets strung out on meth......ahhh just joking....ahh NO AM I AM NOT...fKthem
Any Twitter employee could do a better job running this hot mess of a channel.
So many useless people these days, I see them come and go at my work place, mostly Jelly fish- No back bone.
Should redo this clip with the girl dressed up like the strawman she is.
Every babylon bee video seems like it was written by a 50 year old man with a fox news addiction
So working for Twitter isn't a real job?  🤔
Ha, ha. Total strawman humour.   Demand for experienced tech workers is very high right now. Ex Twitter employees will have no problem. That's partly why nearly 90% of Twitter workers have decided to leave and seek employment elsewhere.
These social media employees are just like Zoo animals, there's no possible way they can survive in the wild of the real world
Not sure if this is funny or sad AF? But I’m going with funny AF😂😂😂😂😂
That was sooo funny!!
She’s a good actor. “How do you get any work...” and she responds with an aggressive pulling back. Well done
You is art imitating life. Own a company and this is how these kids act. "Work" is a four letter word to these kids.
I hope so much these useless twitter so called workers end up bagging groceries they think isnt expensive!!!  Welcome to reality dummies!!!! In america it was you work hard and receive your worth!!! Not everything handed to you
This is soooo triggering!
Ow please make one where Elon buys out the government of the USA…
I hear they got lovely homeless encampment in San Fran.   Good luck
Bruh. I have been subscribed to Babylon bee a long time. Just looked, was unsubscribed. Heck YouTube?!
Omfg 😅😅😅😅 the fact that this is probably real is funny
i thought it was Anna Kendrick in the thumbnail
Former Twitter employees are discovering their new pronouns have become were/was
It's funny watching pasty white 20somethings with massive college debt sweet making fast food. And then they find our their parents are even worse off 🤣🤣🤣
All those Twitter employees should enjoy saying.  Can i take your order today!!!
As funny as this skit is....we are truly becoming a useless society built on the hard work of many generations before us. Check out anything by the late Kevin Samuels, Awaken with JP, Coach Greg Adams etc.
Add a comment...
Twitter. Owned by fags and ran by fags
Ok. Someone must be from Michigan…they actually mentioned Fruitport 😂
Yall run a satire media compnay. Not really sure what high horse you thought you had. You're just as useless to society as twitter employees.
Yo Im completely pro-Trump and this "skit" was about as funny as being teabagged by Joe Biden
Do you guys really think Twitter employees aren't top talent tech folks?
Great. NO safe spaces
The sad fucking part is that there really are morons out there like this!
I have opening for them as my parrot shit cleaner paying 1 US and hour if they want to...😂
I was expecting her to accuse them of "Black Facing."
So funny but probably sooooooo true 😂😂
lol this was def todays kids
This was fantastic, I would have added in a bunch of Woke religious dogma. She needed to be ranting about how he was racist and privileged for even conducting an interview and not just giving her the job since she is a woman-she/her. Should could have scolded him for assuming she is what she is... a woman and she/her. Bringing up how there should be an employee that is black, trans, and disabled in every single role, but that she is appropriate because she acknowledges her privilege/sin.  The opportunities available for jokes with the Woke stuff are endless.
I absolutely love this!!! Elon is a genius. Keep these coming.
it's difficult for twitter employees to find work because they never had one before.
'What was it you'd say, ya did there?' Was that an office space reference haha
She is smarter than our Prime Minister Trudeau.  She could give that a try
Unrealistic. He wasn't called names for being w. 😆
Lmao 😂😂😂
This might be a bit too close to reality.
Good one !
I am actually confused why twitter has so many employees and what they actually do for a company that doesn’t make a physical product or have a physical service or a location that a consumer base can come to.
EPIC!
I wiped the grease off my hands just long enough to say how good that was. Well back to work. not work! doing stuff
These just keep getting better and better!!!  Love you guys!  Thank you!
Looks like the acting was heavily inspired by the video "A Millennial Job Interview"
If she could figure out how not to read, be coherent and become brain dead, she would make a great House Senator😂
Congratulations on getting your twitter account back 😊
Cornhole means something different where I come from
Yall obviousyl being blessd by the higest to do his work... Keep on
This is what college humor use to be until they sold their spine
Yup, just another reason ppl don't wanna work
I'll guarantee you none of these lefties will be doing any physical labor
It's okay, McDonalds is hiring, same with every retail and restaurant job. If those aren't enticing enough Warehouse jobs like Amazon need new workers too. :D
Do these petulant little geeky brats realize the disdain that most of us, who worked most of our lives, have toward them?
Non-Americans running the Show on Twitter
Wow, are these ex employees in for a rude awakening.
She'll do fine, on Onlyfans.
HAHAHAH. I am a tech worker, still out of my home. And I can relate - I honestly don't think I can work another REAL JOB. Damn! But to be honest, my so called past real manual labor jobs were fun. More real people there. Supervisors more relaxed. Fridge full of Beer. Yes Beer. Manager had a Porn Star as a wife, and she would bring her friends  to the office. My tech job is boring and mentally mundane, unless I am solving a tech problem or creating. Still this is believable.
I'm all for sucking Elon's dick but him firing almost his entire programming staff is kinda fucking retarded.
LMAO! Brillinat!
😂😂
It's sad they will have to actually work for a living now! LoL 😆
Just think this skit isn't really a skit it the sad truth and these dumb arse will never work a real job ever. There going to be unemployed and reliant on others forever being that sad and stupid, lazy, ignorant, arrogant, foolish and narcissistic means their permanently unemployable. Not sad these stupid fucks will learn life is real hard on fuckwits.
Dag nabbit.  Awesome
government workers seem like they do more work than woke workers...lol!
Oh poor thing, you have to look for a real job.
Probably totally accurate.
😂
Isn't it a bit mean spirited to make fun of people that worked at a company that your company was in conflict with?  Also, the idea that running content moderation at Twitter was trivially easy is laughably naive. Content moderation at scale is impossible to do well, and very difficult to do at a medium level of competence.  The satire in this piece strikes me as too far removed from the truth to really work.
Watch the extended video https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k66Vkihwq85708b2FzpZeYp0TcGe_O2_I
I heard that Elon is letting you back on Twitter. Send this to him! I can't as my account was banned.
Pretty much sums up millennials
LOLOLOLOLOL I was not expecting this
Girl:  the word Job offends me Also Girl:  so it’s like a “job job”
At least she didn't bring up any of that gender crap...
This is right there with a bunch of friends of mine who work in cooshie office jobs find out that I work in a factory with no air conditioning on the factory floor.  They look at me like I work at some stone age facility.  Worked in lots of different places as industrial maintenance.  None of them were air conditioned for creature comfort.  If they had AC at all, it was to keep new untreated parts from rusting.
That was some funny shit!
Who is Steve from Fruitport Michigan?
Don't care. Amazing how easy you kids have it now. You wouldn't know what hard work or just work is unless it hit you. Musk is a worker and expects his employees to do the same. You all are a lazy lot. You complain when you don't get your way. Plus most of you are WOKE! Free speech. Not your shit. Go find another woke company. Poor baby!
What I love the most about what is happening is the insult "learn to code", that snarky reply they would give to working class people when they lost jobs is now the biggest burn you can say to one of them, because they were surrounded by some really talented people in tech and could have learned a lot, but instead they built their paper fiefdoms around being bullies and "woke" to the max.
She said cornhole.
Yup modern internet companies seriously have employees like this.
I wish the guy at the end and come in with a little grease on his face and the video had gone that direction. Regardless, great video!
Most of the people who got fired were just programmers and engineers
S'alright. She no doubt lives in San Fran and will receive thousands upon thousands of dollars in unemployment benefits for years to come. She's gonna be juuuuuuuuuust fine.
Does Babylon bee not realize that essentially every single fired Twitter employee got better, higher paying jobs in the same field? While Elon has already lost billions? Also, the exact same kinda people are running Babylon's shitty website, a bunch of people who only know how to code. So, how does this make any sense? Are Babylon bee's writers so deep in denial of reality that they don't realize how fucking moronic and unfunny they are?
Love it! 😂
welcome back to Twitter BB🐝
Elon Musk: What would you say ya do here? Twitter Employee: Well look, I already told you! I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to! I have people skills! I am good at dealing with people! Can't you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?
And that’s called being smacked by reality.😊
The sad thing is this is probably far less satirical than it's meant to be.
Who else noticed he intonated "you did there?" in exactly the same way John C McGinley did in Office Space?
She lost that opportunity at being late.
I doubt the average Twitter employee acts like this.
The elements of truth make this particularly humorous.  Works, er... achieves the purpose, for me!
So true
Lol!
Its a funny parody, but seriously if you had a business would you employ an ex twitter employee? These are people who have literally now said to the world, we expect a free lunch, a 6 figure salary and we are not prepared to work hard or we will quit .... errr good luck with that.
They/them have no clue what real work is like lol
I wonder what the job market is for censors? 🤣
Beauty office space reference 👌
So what you are saying working for Elon Musk isn't a real job? Lol
The real question I have is…. What was it that she ate that she though was shrimp o.0!😂
I wonder what it's like to work at the babylon bee and not have a real job.
Help wanted.  Many positions available ;)
Elon Musk did a damn good job in teaching the spoiled brats working for Twitter a bit of reality.
Who spotted the reference to The Office movie? 😄
Over on CNN all the lefties in the comments are shrieking
Plenty of jobs flippin burgers pumping gas bagging groceries All brought to you by the dimension case Joe Biden plenty of jobs out there according to him.
This is soup for the soul ... take my like!
awesome and so true
Marvelous!
What the eff is this garbage? 😐
God put Elon Musk there! He's cleaning out the filth! I have no reason to believe anything negative!
Are organ transplants vegan? How many vegans can we get off the wait list? Asking for an uncle.  He doesn't want to vote democrat in the next election.
Lmao a Christian satire site lambasting the employees instead of like the richest man ever who screwed up catastrophically in his first week at his job. Keep simping for capitalism Christians; surely one day it will produce a needle big enough or a camel small enough to get through that eye.
Lmfao Elon Musk is an utter BUFFOON slamming twitter into the dirt (where it belongs) 😂🤣
I was shocked when that insensitive NAZI assumed thems gender disgusting.
Twitter Employee when applying to McDonalds, "What do you mean I don't get free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and I don't get paid 4-6 day weekends with free wine on tap?"
Yep..that's all Twitter people. Elon was right and he did great by kicking them out. That's why Twitter is great again. With his policies only the best will remain. Twitter has a great future. Oh did you already pay your 8$? Did you know with only 8$ you can be anyone you like? To late..they stopped that...but how about working endless hours..
Oh
Awesome
That last bit cracked me up.
Do these people have any clue as to what 'corn hole' means?
Hmmm 🤔 it’s interesting that liberal views translates to a useless annoying person. It’s almost like conservatives are the backbones of society and liberals sit back and complain about random stuff.
What would you say you do at Twitter #officespace
😂😂😂 this is what the World has come to! This is a hilarious skit and it’s so fucking true and on point
At 1:04 his line, is from Office Space, when the consultants are asking them what they do...
For the algorithm
This was so cringe.. but to know there is people out there like this.. is even more cringe :/
Just brilliant!
Learn to weld
The sad thing is, this isn't even parody.  These people exist, and behave EXACTLY this way.
yeah basically ...
RLOL ...
😂😂😂😂
I HATE LIBTARDS WITH EVERY OUNCE OF MY BEING.  F U SCUM LIBS
Not feeling like putting in some hard hours for a year and make enough to retire? Get in line with the 10000 Facebook guys
i've worked at places where people were almost this entitled.  when they switched the starbucks coffee to maxwell house people howled.  i came from a shirt and tie 8-5 real job and was shocked at how this place was run and the money blown on stupid stuff.  i knew it wasn't going to last.  company went tits up within 2 years.
I am looking for a highly qualified liberal to kiss my a**. Several times a day.
The irony of writing a skit mocking the work ethic of ex-twitter employees with the most unfunny low effort comedy writing I have ever seen
"...meditation room..." ROFL
Lol 😂
This a joke of Twitter employee or realistic replay of how they operate?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is exactly spot on! These former Twitter employees have no clue what work is
Catch the nod to Office Space at 1:05? Cool.
jesus christ how fucking tone deaf is this comment section and this video
HAHHAHAAAA great production
while waiting for the babylon bee to actually make a funny joke, i decided to try my hand at knitting. as of this video's release, i've successfully knitted a space elevator to the moon and am halfway complete on the elevator from the moon to mars.  which, incidentally, is more than elon has done since he said there would be a man on mars in ten years - eleven years ago.
This acting is actually quite bad?
From the same group that claim Boomers had it easy 💀😂😂
wait. you forgot to tell her how much does the job pays. lol.
She is attractive but for the insanity
No comments on his office space "what is it you do here?" delivery? 😄
100%
The problem is that this is more real than we would like to admit.
Maybe she can bake cupcakes !
Loved the ending!🤣
That Office Space reference! 😆
The real life of this , is uncanny.  🤣
Kari Lake for  president!
The elites wanted all manufacturing out of America cause it was dirty. They wanted high tech. Now we all know high tech is the dirtiest sleazyest most degenerate business in the history of mankind.
Probably closer to reality than you might think
Funny.  Just imagine how happy republicans are that a wealthy, socially elite High functioning autistic dual national internationalist ended 10k American jobs.
Love the ending lol
😂
I hear Ukrainian Nazis are desperately looking for cupid stunt woke coders to promote LGBTQ and transgender rights.
LOL !!!
A resume which reads “useless and lazy person who has never known real work” will surely lead to another cushy job somewhere. Right??  F every millennial who has  no work ethic.
1:16 even with an adams' apple.. this is so on point with liberal marxist entitlement it is too painful to listen to even for comedy.
This is a pretty stupid satire. Guess you can't expect much from right wing comedians. Most of those fired are software engineers with more skill individually then your staff combined.
I REEEALY HOPE THIS WAS YOUR FIRST TWEET AFTER BEING UNBANNED
U guys laugh but I’ve literally spoken to a 20-something year old who said they HAD TO quit their job because they were “expected to be on time” and “work was too hard” ....and this was for a gas station attendant. Literally at least half the 20- somethings and younger I know think this way. Idk what happened but it’s gross. We’re so doomed as a society.
Gonna be a long hard fall for the now homeless twits. But, there will always be that bean bag chair in mom and dad's basement. Couldn't happen to a more enterprising group of socialists.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now you have to learn to live like normal people
My be she can get a green job where those ex keystone pipeline people were told to go by Joe.
Not a single comment recognised the repeated office space references (the Bobs)
Looks like all the fast food drive throughs will be fully staffed again!!!!!!
Congrats for being un-jailed! 🇺🇸
And exactly how many female bricklayers are we expecting in 2022, to even it up, cunts?
Talk to one of the pipe line workers and see if they have any leads for you.
I think I understand now why a manufacturer of dryers included this warning with the machine. "Do not put explosives or gasoline in the water compartment for the steam cycle."
Showing up late to a job interview would have been the end of that interview. If this was an application to a REAL job. But this is funny xD
How he cared was so off from reality. Bosses don't give a shit. Trigger words, work and schedules.
🤣🤣🤣
you guys. thank God you're on the good side.
Genious!!
love the office space reference
When you take all those perks out of your business and just give the basics you know medical insurance, a paycheck  and maybe 401K Twitter would save a lot of money in daily running costs
😂🤣😂🤣 she should probabaly work for pampered chef....I really need a job...and its no joke!
They are the bourgeoisie and yet are somehow fighting the bourgeoisie 🤷
You guys are the SNL of our age. 😂😂😂 Thank you
That actress was spot on
Lmao the end bit really got me
3395//;))
Is
But have you heard of Forward?😂
welcome back to twitter!
Elon musk doing gods work
Why is the interviewer on the defensive?  It was like a role reversal !
Exactly...lol
I cannot stop laughing. Typical GenZ twittertwit.
Fact check their fart box mouths
Lolo stupid people so ignorant so sick of it
Sadly this is not even satire!!!
The Twitter employees are far MORE delicate than displayed here. lol
The jokes write themselves :D well done
LOL! Gen Z🤣
The unthinkable ending has me 😀
All these people are deserving to be let go
Hilarious
😂 poor thing they are so fragile
"Cornhole sesh" - A Twitter whore
I wonder how long it takes before Elon sells the company at a lost..
Don't know if it was intended for the line "afternoon cornhole sesh" was meant as a double entre, it definitely was funny for the character.
Potentially the most boomer thing I've ever seen
Very spot on I must say. She played a perfect bimbo. How dare that 4 letter word be implied to do "stuff".
Twitter employee's new pronouns are "Was" and "Were".  Bwahahahaahah!
"back to cornhole" Is she talking about ....
Honestly Twitter doesn't seem like such a bad place to work to be honest
What a PATHETIC world we live in
Good ,hope she takes years to get a job ,she is probably one of the woke that banned me for life for stating the truth with evidence..sickening !
Omg I can’t even imagine how triggered this video has made people lmao brilliant!
You're fired You're fired You're fired any questions
Hair wasn't blue/purple, and nose wasn't big enough.  But she still did good.
I pray for the hiring managers these days
I did not realize that this channel started doing hidden cameras.
YouTube unsubbed me again, re-subscribing
Bahahahahha the sound of her flip flops is so TRUE
3:34 "Babylon Beeah" 😅😂  So snooty and distinguished!
😂
My cousin talks like her, just like her, works at a similar place
WAIT! Her first line was "Mr. Dunstenson". How did she even manage that?  There's zero chance he had declared his personal pronouns.
There are so many toilets those fired Twitter employees can clean in order to be helpful to society
These ex-Twitter employees will be fine.  I’m sure they’ll be able to find a job with Amazon, Facebook, Lyft, Stripe, or Microsoft, right?   Right???
He has an MRE on his desk. That boss is prepared.
Thought she was gonna cry blackface when the guy put his hand up.
My husband worked in the same building as LinkedIn staff in Sydney. From what he told me of the conversations he overheard, this isn’t as far fetched as it may seem. The IT ‘space’ is full of nothing jobs.
this can't be for real fire the b-----
If I was the interviewer, this video would've ended at exactly the first 30 seconds I had to remind myself this was just an actress because I wanted to 3-stooge her so bad
Somehow I think this is real. LOL
Lmao @ stupid uneducated Americans who happily think recently fired twitter engineers at the top of the software world won’t get another job somewhere else making 200k whenever they want
Wait until they have to compete with the imports they so happily brought in to take American code writer jobs. Karma inbound at life-speed...
That was funny.........but why am I laughing?
Looking forward to lots of Twitter content. :D
Love the nod to Office Space
Sadly, I have younger relations who are just like this.
Anyone else notice the John C McGinley Office Space reference?  The pause was spot on!
About right for kids these day.....
I have a job for her! Planting tulips 😉
She is the perfect example of the downfall of the United States.
I'd say that was accurate....except for the last 5 seconds!!
This isn't even remotely close. Where was her mask? Why wasn't she accusing them of murder because they weren't wearing non anti-viral n95 masks? Why didn't she report them for trying to shake her hand which would instantly kill everyone because the c0v1d? What? We just going to forget what a bunch of ignorant douchenozzles you all acted like over the deadly c0v1d?
Lol😂
That is so twitter employes.
Rooftop cornhole sesh sounds pretty gay
1:05 Perfect stealthy Office Space reference.
Eddie 0 seconds ago On my  cleaning company we hire new workers ,  Ex Twitters employees only  are qualified for new openings 😉 Most important no lunch paid by company on contract , get your own liunch
good office space reference lmao
Funny
I heard they can retrain for coal mining jobs!!
This is what social media does when someone is exposed to it from childhood.  Elon thinks AI is far more dangerous to mankind than nukes.  I'm starting to think social media will destroy humanity even faster.
That was hilarious.
When an former Twitter employee applies for a job, do they introduce themselves as a twit?
yup
Baskin-Robbins might give you a job once you say you worked at Twitter no one in their right mind would hire you
Laughing at this comment section. Adults complaining about other adults complaining.
The  juniors  are going to  crash and  burn
I wonder how many yuppies will have to face the music like this?
Even though I enjoyed it I was straight faced the entire time until the end when he busted out mamosas and corn hole sesh!
As someone who is still banned from Twitter, I must say this is rather entertaining.
love the office space reference at 1:00 :)
It should have ended at the beginning with "you're late, GTFO", but maybe that wouldn't have been as funny.
HEY, FOLKS!!!!  Go find the YouTube Video where a guy invented like a breathalyzer for your iPhone and then went on Shark Tank and got Mark Cuban to invest, i.e., "GIVE" him millions of dollars, was a great idea, and then Cuban started tracking him and calling him about the product, and the guy would be at the casino, and then in Cabo, and then overseas, etc., all the time telling Cuban he was "marketing" and "networking" with new clients, vendors, etc., and the guy just went through all the money and then the corporate phone got cut off.  Cuban said it was the worst deal and the most money he ever lost on Shark Tank.
the facisl expressions are idk, so good?
Hey Bee, big tech actually has pronoun meetings, where employees sit around and discuss: a) Their pronouns b)  A word that describes their feelings I'm 100% serious.  I'm glad I worked remote because my internet always "died" during these.
Sad but true!!!!
Can we feed people like that to sharks , Do we want that kind of ignorance diluting the gene pool , now do we . We can use a school of lemon sharks , there small . or lampreys .
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Epic..
Awwwww how sad.  That mean bad man, Ewon Musk, bought their widdle wiberal pwayground.  Awwwwwwwwwwww so sad.
Big Tech offers: Free haircuts, Free massages, Free lunches, Free snacks, Free desserts, Free oil changes, Free shuttles to work, Free dry cleaning, Free therapy, Free "birthing person" egg freezing, and safe space rooms. It's why the Metaverse took 12,000 employees and a billion dollars to create.  But 12 year old VR Chat rooms are better.
Plot twist, she was triggered by the wedding ring on thw man's hand.
This is so true.   They haven’t had to do any hard work.
It's Funny, cause we dropped outta high school and get greasy for $12/hr.    /s
Demoncraps leftist commie socialist disgrace welcome to the real world go Elon musk
Bahaha.. gold
The Bee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <inhale>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The saddest part is these are the people who'll vote Democrat and expect free handouts.
Nurse or home care provider. 100 percent certain it’ll blow her mind that home care providers don’t have a Roomba to clean the house or their patients.
Man I was 16 when I had my first job, I worked in a tape factory then I did landscaping, then the army, then prospecting for a minning company, thank god I have the work ethic I have or I would be fucked haha
WOW, we went from the Greatest Generation ever in WW2 to the worst generation EVER!!!
You worked for what? What is cornhole?  I used to use corncobs in the outhouse.
An exaggeration which shouts volumes.
Lol. Enjoyed the shout-out to "Office Space".
you guys are the best
I'm glad this generation is useless. Job security for the rest.

"These Twitter employees didn't have a real job" ... coming from the people at Babylon Bee? 🤣🤣
I know some these shit HEADS...
I just discovered I'm a twitter employee....😲
What’s sad is that this is actually true!
I'm so glad Elon fired all of those lazy fuckers at Twitter. Fuckin Millennials. Hard work and good ethics I always say will get you somewhere.
hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahah....aaaahhhh
Never hire anyone who worked at Twitter
Why would she apply to a factory job? lol
Wow Fuck you shitbags
failed parents. stupid people should raise kids.
So generation X, a worthless and weak generation.
Love the “Office Space” reference!
To the unemployed twitter employees all I can say is "Learn to Coal". Get out there and mine that sweet, sweet, sooty black gold.
You guys are supposed to be a satirical outlet, why is your reporting more accurate and realistic than most mainstream media?
What a twist at the end!
This really wasn't funny.
It's understandable why ditch diggers are so angry. They wasted away their education and now they slave away at meaningless work for the rest of their pathetic lives barely able to make ends meet.  Deep down they wish they had paid attention in school so they to could be treated like a real human.
02:49 hey, she has the makings of a really good Health and Safety person!!
Nailed it!!! 😂😂😂 Forgot to include something about gender neutral bathrooms and the alphabet cult.
LOL!  You just know this isn't too far off from reality for those woke dults
Man the Babylon Bee captures this generation perfectly. It's uncanny
WTF 😳
Sadly that is how Millennials and GenZ are now.
Did Elon Musk bought The Babylon Bee? This boomer  kids-these-days-are-so-sensitive "humour" with a layer of sarcasm really feels like it.
Work: that four lettered word that ends with "k".  Keep that swear word away from me.😂
Now we see why Schumer is able to sell the idea of illegal immigrants taking over the work force. It’s just a new brand of slavery. Democrats will never leave their racist roots.
Ahhh the "poor entitled" left wingers. Try going to Cuba and get a job in "your" own country of "thought!"
Do you know if any ex-twitter employees escaped...eh...took refuge from that oppresive Elon in Germany? I was just in a sauna when a girl...a little bit like that fine specimen in your clip came in (in a bathing suit, which is prohibited in german saunas...you do it in te nude!) and wailed about that it is far too hot (just 70°Celsius...eh 160° Fahrenheit...so freezing cold) in there. I quietly told her that there are other saunas with less temperature and that she should consider the clothing-optional as in "no clothing allowed" She got a horror-stricken look at this...and explained that in the other saunas there is no one to speak to.  "Well speaking in saunas is quite offensive to others. It invades not only my safe space, so saunas maybe aren't your thing, lady?" She hyperventilated at this and left in a hurry... maybe i was a bit too harsh.
The Rights portrayal of Libs is total BS.  Started in 95 with Fox Propaganda.
It’s bloody frustrating that his mimicked English accent is better that my real one Ffs 🤦🏻‍♂️
Loved it!
As a tech employee that has worked at two FAANG companies, the amount of time I spend working each week is probably double that of the average worker at generi-company X.
Lol
The end made the video lol
This would have been funny if it weren't true
Who in the heck would hire somebody with the work ethic of Twitter????????????????
The beautiful compassionate inclusive Twitter employees are lucky, they get to be free of The troll Elon and they get to go onto the streets and explore the beautiful diverse liberal utopia they helped make! They'll have no problem finding a new job in such a strong and robust liberal economy and all the tech companies laying off... Hiring new people! The wonderful diverse understanding (ex) Twitter employees got nothing to worry about!!
I've seen videos of their work environment. This isn't far from the truth, that company was a joke.
Rooftop corn hole session, what is that all about?
Don't ever work with anyone who used to work at Twitter. They got their nose stuck too far up their a**
Yooo she’s fine asf what’s her @? She’s gorgeous
There hiring at b.k.
the ending was the best
Since Youtube silences most of my comments, I think they are hiring them and will change the name to YouTwits!
The grease on his hand is “black hand”. Proof of systemic racism
Yeah I wish this was reality because those twitters are useless.  However, plenty of hires at Google, FB, Apple, etc. will roll out the red carpet for them.  At least we have fewer bans of normal people.  If that's all Musk accomplishes, great.
Not too far of a stretch
Well done!!
I'm can't stop laughing!!! Too clever and probably true 👍
Lol, what a waste of space huh, if there ever was a real argument for late-term abortions after the fact, just thinking out loud
The MRE on the desk. Lol
🤣🤣
Nice 👍👍👍👍👍😂
I'm surprised YouTube hasn't flagged this video for misinformation yet.
I know people from major theme parks who have similar attitudes. Someone promised them a discomfort free life.. and nao work jus isn't fun any moarr
I don’t understand Twitter. Aren’t there a million platforms you can go on and voice opinions?
Phenomenal! Still cant stop laughing.
where was Bobby Knight??
Entitled Twitters. Welcome to the real world snowflake
Sad but true … the world is seriously upside down.  D’s right now like, I don’t understand why she didn’t get the job
I hear that there is a fertilizer shortage, they should be able to corner the market with all the BS they are full of 🙄
That’s what happens when you close down all the mental institute specially in California with mentally ill people like this
I'm in the process of interviewing....younger candidates.....for several positions in my agency right now and this video is so unrealistic! That job candidate was portrayed as being way too stable!
"work will set you free"
These people must be concentrated in a camp all together.
What job should Mandy seek out next?
One thing that I still cannot fathom or understand is why does it require thousands of personnel to operate a web site, its just a chit-chat platform.
Not too far off my own recollections from 70s, 80s Affirmative Action.  Even more self-entitled, while lazy as f___, & blatantly disrespectful of authorities or normal job requirements; biggest difference is, "those" were completely unfirable; even hands off fully non-disciplinary; & "they" certainly knew that well.  Always reassuring to know you've completed own quotas satisfactorily, only to be approached to be ordered to complete another 1/2 of a same-waged employee's same quotas, after they'd either flatly refused, or openly threatened the foreman; yet still 100% unfirable.  But that didn't make me any raw racist; suppose it could've.  I don't blame every individual for it, more the whole foul nasty culture that cruelly smothers & chokes them; even many the brighter ones.
Best perk for me was going to the rifle range after lunch.
Now you know why they want their useless college loans paid off.
Ahahahaha
Thanks babylon bee for being hilarious and influencing elon musk in buying twitter
Amazing how some people have been so spoiled by years of economic growth. I guess back to parents basement and video games for them.
I love the knuck-draggers who don't think that coding is a "real job" and the same rubes spend all day on youtube and twitter.  Who exactly do you think is making these products?  I'm guessing these people also don't understand where meat comes from.
Welcome to the new age non worker😂
It's time that the people willing to work get the good jobs...this entitlement is ridiculous  !!!!!!!
Hilarious as always but you definitely missed an ez Black Face/Black Hand layup
Oh my gosh. She is dangerously amazing!!!! Very convincing and most likely an accurate representation of liberals who were at Twitter.
Typical liberal
This shot was funny!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watching non-performers being removed.
Lmao.   They are in for a rude awakening.
This new generation is going to starve to death! 😂😂😂
The sad part is if you run a business and hire people... this is not that far off. Unfortunately.
"What would you sayyyy, ya did there?" Epic homage!
Ah, first contact with actual real life eh? They'll regret leaving Twitter for a dumb caprice soon enough. No going back though. Let's see how things go...
Should have hired her. Now she'll stay on unemployment and we're all paying for her anyway.
She could have been more delighted and smug about the censorship "activity".   Isn't that mostly what they all do?  Best new job line...working for the Dean of Re-education at the local U.
I spit my coffee out at 'Steve from Fruitport, Michigan' - I live 5 minutes from there!
Amazing.
The best perk I had of any job was a company car and boy did I beat the shit out of it, especially when I knew that I was going to be let go due to a company downsizing.  BTW, I returned the vehicle empty of gas.  What a hoot.
Achievement and the knowing I could show up tomorrow and do the same in exchange for a living.
Spacly Space sprockets is a slave driver, "I had to press the same button five time this week!" George Jettson
Cornhole had a different meaning back when I was a kid!
This is absolutely true. Former twitter employees didn't do anything except eat gourmet food, sip starbucks, and do yoga all day.   It was just right that Elon fired them.
To use one of their terms, I got "triggered" watching this.
What’s funny is this is probably very accurate for what the ‘culture’ was like over there
STOP BOOMER BASHING! I have 3 great productive Adult kids that act like adults and I brought them to be that.F a child wont assume responsibility its on them and companies catered to them. My generation would of been kicked to the curb had they demand these perks and worked harder to keep our jobs.
Office space nod. Nice
The actress was amazing!!  She must have gotten to know people at Twitter to prepare for this roll.
That is so funny LMAO
Whats terrible is that its funny because its true.
Elon is a boss. If you act traitorous or mutinous.... especially against the owner showing a lack of trust, you're fired.... the end
I've got a question about Twitter. How can a company that produces absolutely nothing employ over 7500 employees in the first place? Maybe that's what Elon realized when he bought the company and that's why he's getting rid of all the "dead wood" ?
What would you say…you did there.  A classic since the 90’s
Makes you wonder who's going to do our jobs when we're gone. Scary thought isn't it
Thanks!
Babylon Bee Twitter getting a mention on Babylon Bee skit lol
Imagine being so vapid you believe Elon Musk is anything other than a fraud
Sadly this is accurate.
XD
bahahaha this isn't even satire
Anyone I meet with this entitled, dependent, weak mentality immediately gets cut out of my life. People like that will just cause you strife. F**k'em
This is what "Good Writing and Acting Looks Like"  SNL can take some notes.
It’s great to see entitled leftist employees get just what they deserve! Hope this is what is happening in real-life. lol
My son just quit a job not because of the job, but because of the other whiney entitled brats. He has been working on farms since middle school.
all of Silicon Valley is being wiped clean. wok out. we're going back to normal.
Skittle 🌈 Rainbows and Unicorn 🦄 kisses 💋 for all the Twitter champions on their new journey protecting our Democracy though censorship and indoctrination.
classic
Spot on
BB, Keep up the great work, hilarious!
Dempsey Democrat: Creates Twitter and turns it into multi-billion dollar company. Musk Conservative: Buys Twitter and runs it into the ground. Yeah, that makes sense. 🤣
Once again, pure gold!
Greetings from Hungary! Keep up the good work guys! Show mirror to these Marxist social justice warriors!
my brother in christ you make youtube videos for a living. People in glass houses...
And Elon Musk is losing a boat load of money with this company take over. So, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
If the wokesters that work at yahoo would allow facts/links to be submitted on their comments section I would have placed this link on the musk and his twitter take over story.. GO ELON!!
So, so TRUE!!
guys, you are the best! best videos ever!
now i need to know wtf a cornhole is
Wouldn’t hire an ex Twitter worker for anything…..
Perfect display on Democrat kids
You might want to consider giving that actress some therapy after having to act like a liberal. I'm sure that was damaging to her psyche. It must have been so difficult for her.
So dang funny!
About right!
🤣🤣
I surprised she didn't try to bring her emotional support ostrich or something.
Bless their hearts. 😂
Kinda surprised she didn't freak out at him calling her "Miss" and state her pronouns.
This is unfortunately how I think young people are today. But I love getting grease under my nails. I work on my car and my motorcycle, as a hobby, you know, for fun?
That's probably very accurate, lol.
Is anyone else enjoying how the fired twits are bashing Elon in an effort to never work for anyone else ever again, who is going to hire a toxic low output worker.
all too real, I had a man apply for a Food service worker at a government facility, he wanted a limo to pick him up -he wasn't joking.
If they were so useless then why did Musk buy Twitter instead of building a similar product from scratch ?  China's Weibo started as a copy of Twitter's features.  Weibo's market cap is 3.458B he could have done a deal to purchase Weibo's existing code as a starting point  for a lot less than what he bought Twitter for.
So, what did you do there?  great movie reference.
Gas stations hiring . Good luck lol
Spot on.
This is more true than you can imagine
My neighborhood association is very anxious to pick up ex-twitter employees. They're excellent choices for sidewalk supervisor jobs making sure that everyone will stay in line. Ex-twitter employees make the 'perfect Karens'. I was given a citation from one of them for farting outside in my yard. She said it was 'hate speech'. 😉
Scary how close to reality this just might be!
Accurate. I have to work with these dunces.
This video will give twitter employees ptsd.
🤣
Somemore free loaders out on the streets!!!!!! LOL
now that all the people that thought they were someone have let them self go, he didnt have to fire them and they have no one to blame but them self,  Iwould bid for their job and do it for 70% of what any of them were making! now we can get on with twitter 2.0 and make it great again LOL I personally have spent more time on twitter in the last week than all of the last 4 years, the snowflakes having a melt down will soon see no one gives a shit and be gone! here in N.Y we say GOGTFOH go on get the F*** outa here ......
Well,  the left believes that if we don't have Replacement Migration,  who will clean our toilets? Well maybe she can get a job cleaning toilets and learn how her shit stinks too!
Nice subtle nod to Bob from Office Space!
Power to Elon Twitter gets and enema
Elon 2024 maybe 2028?
I get the Office Space reference…subtle..but good.
"Roof-Top Cornhole Sesh!"  ~  LMAO!
My friend and I were talking about some of your skits and we think a few could become tv shows. But the liberals running all the networks wouldn't like that at all.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Twitter has been overrun with Hindus like most US tech business, u should do a video on that, how Americans are excluded from tech workplace as they overstaff them with Hindus exclusively
Sounds bout right 😂😂😂
😂 ok this was pretty good
This skit would have been so much better with a real supervisor, not the beat down beta you served us.
Are the shrimp, non gmo and cage free?  Yas my queen, we only serve cage free shrimps....
Actress reminds me of Anna Kendrick, but way prettier.
What happens when the left runs things - foolishness and chaos.
So had Elon freed Babylon Bee from Twitter jail yet or what?  Every single one of these skits needs to be promoted on Twitter.
welcome to Deso deso decentralized social
You betcha.  I worked four years for the Veterans Administration and the laziness, uselessness, feelings of entitlement and narcissistic attitudes of so many employees shocked me.  Our unit director psychologist was having an extra-marital affair with his own employee and thought he was fooling everyone including his spouse who also worked at the same VA.  Another social worker supervisor was having an affair with one of his employees and got her pregnant.  He already had a wife and children.  They moved the cheater woman to another state and promoted the supervisor up the ladder and on to another VISN.  One of our psychologists had an affair with his secretary who worked at the same desk area with this man's wife.  His spouse eventually died of a brain tumor and he had no empathy about her death.  One psychiatrist would take several days of sick leave when we had a scheduled federal holiday so he could have a full week off.  He was also very arrogant and treated Caucasian women with condescension.  This man refused to speak to me for about six months because he thought that I had "tattled" about an incident.  NOT TRUE.  When it was revealed who did the "tattling" he never apologized and treated me with even more condescension.  Those who can, do.  Those who can't work for the federal government.  Unbelievable! I left after four years.  I could go on with these stories but people would become bored and stop reading.
I can't say I blame her for not wanting to shake hands. At 0:12 his hand is clean and, without leaving the desk, are quite greasy within just 3 minutes.
Love the office space references.
It's so crazy how realistic these are really though
🤣
My best perk was when I worked at the Pentagon. The fact my work was helping to keep our country safe was the most awesome thing I could ever think of. Second was that on my lunch break, I could smoke a cigar in the Pentagon courtyard.
This is epic
what the fuck did Steve do????
Too painful. Had to stop after 2 minutes.
The joke is on ex Twitter employees now!!
It's funnier because people got their feelings hurt.
As a collision tech and mechanic my hands look like that even after a week vacation.  Been a manual laborer since I was 13.
SHOULD  HAVE  FIRED  THEM ALL
Best part of my job working in gaming / gambling was figuring out new ways to steal from the customer and employer... allegedly.
They got no chance in a real World.
Why Steve tho? He didn't du nuffin.
The guy in here, is he a midget?  His arms look very short lol
Genius
Now that IS funny! LMAO!
Ahh, soon we'll hear the sweet, sweet, sound of crying liberals, as they hit the streets of San Francisco. Time to drive South and hit up Google.
Second shift pay premium, night shift pay premium, and someday, on site pay premium. Lol Vacation time accrued at one half rate for off site days?? Will the irony never stop?
Done both Blue Collar & White Collar work. Much prefer Blue Collar. You can tell when you've accomplished something then. Aircraft fly, computer systems operate, machines do useful work, and a nail brush and Goop will remove the evidence of work if you really need clean hands for something. :)
Soon we get a Hashtag #FREE4Mandy  where Mandy demands everything handed to her on a golden platter
Let's see,,, we reinvented the word, "pound sign, ah, the history book and even the word WORK. We now made it possible for ALL generation's too expect too deserve payment for breathing and having sex!
Work?? Read your dictionary. You regulating authoritarian types got a rude awakening coming. Along with tired muscles and blisters, low wage survival will benefit a lot of you mis-guided intellects
She's a perfect fit for the Trudeau or Biden  government. Especially if she can cry on demand.
This is dumb (just like everything else from Babylon Bee). I was just talking this morning about how easily all the Twitter employees who quit will immediately find new jobs. Their skills are in high demand. I'd love to be in their shoes. It's also a bit condescending to suggest it wasn't "a real job"... but what can you expect?
🤣🤣🤣
This is like the literal poster child of the Reddit sub antiwork.
People think this is hilarious but this is literally how these left wing wack job lunatic weirdo snob twitter psychopaths think.
The more I learn about the "work" culture at Twitter the more I'm reminded of Edward Gibbon's _History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,_ which can be summed up in one word:  *Indolence.*
Lol she nailed them fragile loon balls 😅 Ship them off to Canada!
As a Canadian, I have to say that "cornhole" up here is something different.
Why do l think BB isn't too far off on this?
Free stuff that I took without asking.  Just kidding
Better Daily !!!
Twitter employees just received the ice water bucket over the head challenge.
Discusting character but she act sooo good :D
Gold! Pure Gold!
Where I come from "corn hole" means something else. I always find it funny when someone says "I was playing corn hole."
Really funny that that a YouTube channel engages in this satire, considering.
😂
Haha fruitport Michigan that's one town over from me
The ex-twitter employee fits the description “He jests at scars who never felt a wound,”. Calloused hands, sore back, dirt under the fingernails, and grease on palms working a blue collar job is a badge of honor my view.  Like scars acquired in battle.
Thousands of Twittites are flooding grandmas basement with their tears
Bye twitter
Twitter is under new management, Facebook is next. YouTube in the offing.
Elon doings gods work.
🤣🤣🤣
I'm used to your parodys.....this video was spot-on.
This is awesome
Unfortunately this is the current work ethic of today’s liberal Democrats that don’t know anything beyond their phones. I fear for the future of this once great nation.
We have turned a whole generation into Maynard G. Krebs.
Your fired
lol
Very accurate depiction😂
Funny how "learn to code" from Twitter employees a few years ago has now come back around to them being told "learn to weld"
Get better actors.
Unfortunately it's common in IT for people to earn six-figure incomes doing very little meaningful work. Not everyone is lazy, not everyone asked for it. Eventually when you're not producing anything everything boils down to process and politics. Yuck.  I've seen a lack of work ethic in my own company and projects, and it sucks. I often had to stay up late to make up for what others couldn't or wouldn't do.
Awesome
do people watching this not realize how difficult being a software engineer is? it requires one of the most difficult degrees in the world and is vastly more challenging than working in a factory lol
We have decided that the comedy value of this post was most epic
wow this is incredibly accurate 🤣
This video currently has 742 downvotes.... no doubt all former twitter employees.
I’ve worked a variety of “real jobs” from retail to landscaping. It definitely varies by company and team, but tech jobs can be far more demanding than any blue collar position I’ve experienced. I’ve worked a year long death march, 7 days a week, working through every weekend, holiday, wedding anniversary, etc. if I wasn’t sleeping, I was working, and so was the rest of my team. I’ve never been pushed that hard in a blue collar job. Every economic downturn permanently ratchets up the workload. The new model is to burn out and replace employees every two years. There are definitely some chill tech jobs out there, but I bet the people laughing at this has never worked in tech, or have only experienced large, bloated, inefficient companies.
he is a good actor, she aint
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 some entitled request for meditation room???
LOL the ending after she left.
The reason this is so hilarious is because of how close this is to actual reality...
I don't understand how this is funny. You just showed actual, current events 🤣
The Woko Haram are getting what's coming to them 😂
This would be effective comedy - if it was funny.
The end was PERFECT!
They actually casted her as a conservative looking church girl.
A shout out to Steve in Fruitport!
They're the result of parents that joyfully declared that their children will have everything that they didn't growing up.  Even if it wasn't something they needed.
But I spoke to you, you owe me money for the abuse I suffered.
One of the best compliments I ever received was from my son’s employer about how hardworking my son was. That same man hired my other son and my daughter. All six kids have good jobs. Maybe their Mom had something to do with it, I never could get a lick of work out of them.
Too freaking funny...
I had to quit a perfectly good office job because the lazy brats wouldn't get out of their chairs for 2 seconds and actually walk across the room once in a while
I am 99% sure this happens 100% of the time.
Kick 'em to the curb. That is what they did to us. Elon, may I have my account back now?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂😂
Probably spot on accurate!
Loved the Office Space reference at 1:07.
More of a documentary than a parody.
Excuse me??!?!11? Did you just assume her/his/they/them/potato's gender at the end there?
I have a liberal friend that literally thinks robots are going to run the future and she won't have to work anymore and that food will be free because the robots will be farmers..... that's the mentality of Millennials today and younger generation.
Not sure if this makes me laugh or cry.
Totally down for rooftop cornhole sesh
I think the real question should be… Their education and was it entirely the fault of the parents, or was it the schools or/and the media? Yes perhaps they were spoiled as children growing up… but then has anyone read the books by Dr. Spock (not the Star Trek character) Dr. Spock was a pediatrician psychologist in raising babies… to let them be free to do what ever they want, of which punishment of any violent nature would be deemed as child abuse.
Love the Bee! Keep up the great work….labor…i mean stuff ya’ll.
1. New employee didn’t show up for work on the 1st day. Called him but didn’t reply. Called his home number and mommy answered and she told us her son had a change of mind.  2. New employee came to office late on his first day and didn’t come back after lunch. Avoided all our calls and finally his mommy called to say her son felt very stressed attending the training session and ask to pay his 1/2 day of work… I blame the parents.
$8
I believe someone paid $44B for their work product.
BYOG!!! LOL. Bring your own Guru!  LOL😆
If she ask nicely maybe a ex keystone pipeline worker can show her how/where to find another job
😆
ENCORE
Lol. Libtards of TikTok would never get banned from Twitter. Babylon Bee certainly would though 🤣 but free speech, right...right? 🤷🤣
Lol!!!!! Poor people, rough awakening coming.
Why is this so disturbingly accurate.....
She will soon be a legislator from New York.
These Twatters (pretty sure that is the plural of Twitter) have no idea how to work in the real world of even how to get a job!!  That ending is Classic!!
She acts too good. Is she really just an "actor" or did she really work at Twitter? Either way, she makes me really angry. My sofa can't handle much more punches anymore.
Accurate
The sad thing is that many of these pampered employees will now be unleashed upon and integrated into the normal work environment. Many will become our new co-workers that we all have to deal with.  Thanks Elon.
This was hilarious!!!
It use to just be farmers and handymen who kept alcohol on hand for the work day.  Now everyone’s doing it smh
i know this is a joke....it is making fun of the useless woman who has no idea about real work..... i would like to point out the dunsonsons and sons guy. he is talking to this woman like is going to crumble at any moment....that one word she finds offensive is going to implode the world......thats the reality today though....this guy is walking on egg shells afraid to say words. that is the western world right now. everyone too afraid to say anything.  you all are so used to it that no one cares though.
This is the opposite of "Office Space"  The Lumberghs have become the employees...
Looks like Twitter might have had some useless little
They will all end up working for McDonalds.....
I did some acting in HS and College. Where can I send an audition video? Seriously, "It's a Southern Thing" has totally ignored my pleas to join their acting group and I really wanna play too!!!!!!
Would love to see these ppl’s actual interviews! Lol… I feel like they’d be even worse than this girl.
I'm totally convinced that that's what most of them did, why would Twitter need 3700 employees???
From what I keep seeing about Twitter, there is no way this is a satire.
LOL
Perfect example of wokeness
Now,you little ex-Twitter bitches have to work to earn your keep.
Please someone buy Reddit, the platform is unbearable.
Love it.
The 2nd best perk at my 1st real job was the annual Xmas party & we were allowed to drink alcohol. Alcohol + attractive coworkers who liked each other made for great post-Xmas stories.
I hate how he starts pandering to her.
Mocking people who lost their job is pretty fucked up.
This one is actually very well acted. Better than the Cali residents move to Texas ones.  Also, im guessing "BYOG" stands for "be your own guru".
The best perk at my 1st real job (back in the 1980's) was the choice of healthcare. My wife & I were young so I had the option of a less expensive plan, then when we started having kids I could choose a more expensive option that covered all the birthing expenses & the kids after they were born.
Best job perk, if it was too hot for work the boss would pick us up for a cool off session at the beach. Once the heat of the day past we all got back on the roof happy to work. Thank Bill!
The sad part is I don’t know which of this stuff about Twitter is actually true because I bet a lot of it is. 😂
The actress is pretty. 😮🔥
Hey Babylon Bee, do one where you put a giant "new gender" counter up against the national deficit counter.
So funny 😂
Cry all you want. But do it while carrying two bundles of shingles up that ladder.
This was a documentary with a punch line at the end.
Great!
I built a bed under my desk and slept half the day.
Musk is smart, Musk is dumber than paint... sounds like some top management people I've known.
Poor Bee. They try so hard to lampoon reality but reality is always more hilarious than they are...
Shout out to Fruitport Michigan!!
The NY Times anxiously reports hundreds of Twitter losers quitting, upset by Elon’s full throttle work ethic demands    Bwahahahaha.
Cage Free Shrimp. 😂
Facebook next Elon 🤣
The ending was the best, roof top cornhole 😆😅
Learn to COAL
Lol i needed this
I dont think this was acting scene i think it was a real Twitter interaction
ya'll missed a great chance to throw owen benjamin in there on the "ban" list for a good laugh.
Last one aa is now americans anonomous because if you love america your probably drinking the pain away like me
Get a life
One day at a time proceedes to hold up a one year coin..... i didnt know they gave out participation trophys for failing at aa
The last part was the best!  Almost spit out my breakfast!
Real world gonna smack them all in the face
When did the BB start doing factual documentaries??? Awesome expansion strategy.
I thought the twist would be the "what was on his hand" was referring to the wedding ring
Wow , there is 3 minutes of my life I can't get back ... UGH !!!
I’m starting a competing social media site. It will be called Tweeter, and the posts will be called Twits.
Yup  nailed it.
Unfortunately it's not only former Twits who think this way.  I'm 72 and the world of employment has become very much like Disneyland (pun intended).  When I was young saying things like "Paternity Leave" or filing a worker's compensation claim would get you fired, and if you applied somewhere else for a job your former employer would gladly rat you off for your "crimes".
So, she's really been 'cornholed' I guess.
The street population is on the rise😂😂😂
Elon musk is a satan worshipper. Look at his Halloween costume.
Lol
Ha ha!  She's looking for a job, not work!
I’m glad I have good REAL WORLD work ethic. I used to work part time at food Lion during high school and my job was simply to stock a few areas of the store and clean the bathrooms and take out trash. I ended up cleaning the entire back room several times and most of the store, including the kitchen, because I got done with my main job responsibilities rather quickly. Nobody even asked me to do those things.  Then I could f around a bit because I didn’t have anything left to do. The other person who worked the same position as me did barely anything and just stood and twiddled his thumbs and I had to make a few complaints to my manager about the person’s lack of care.  Just a personal anecdote that shows not all young people are incompetent
Haha that was great!
Isn't that the "Eat All The Babies" chick that trolled AOC a few years ago?
Lol "Steve from fruitport michigan, banned"🤣 lol if anyone from michigan knows fruitport, you'll know the reputation it has (kkk) and understand that they probably weren't wrong for banning Steve🤣
Lmao
I'm guessing that "cornhole session" doesn't mean what it used to...
The sad thing is that this is close to the truth.
Whatever, almost any tech job especially with social media and games would hire someone like this. Call of Duty has almost every pride flag (except the straight pride flag), yeah that's right a WAR GAME has gay pride flags for your avatar. Games are where the whole stupid pronoun shit came from. People have avatars and it let's them be what they want. You asked, I answered.
I KNOW this is satire, but it's like 100% real... srsly.  it's exactly like this. For reals
Just wait for the labour market to tighten! Squeeling pigs running in circles!
You put in some of that Office Space stuff..
This is great, an exact truth of the generation
Personal Responsibility - it's a conservative thing that lefties accuse of being racist.
Original BB: *writes satire about real life to be funny*  Current BB: *writes documentaries about real life and is now depressing*
It’s a classic 😂
my god .. so funny.
👁️ ❤the 🐝
Brilliant
Not to worry missy  ,  biden says there are hundreds of thousands of jobs available out there .
They'll starve
"What would you say... you did there?" The way he said it gave me flashbacks to Office Space lmao
Haha real job😂
That fact i cringed this hard means this has happened.
+9000 for the Office Space reference! 🤣
This was better than SNL. For real.
Starbucks awaits them
Good luck to them! 😂
love how they are blaming musk but their own kind sold out to him lol.  the left ignoring the actual problem is priceless
I can see this being a series also. Not as good yet as the Libs to Texas, but could be a good series.
HOW DARE HE ASSUME HER GENDER!
It's not a laid off, it's a "down the road"
These people are going find out that other jobs are not so easy.
Get used to telling former Twitter employees - "I'll have a double tall mocha with whip to go." 😏☕
🤣🤣🤣
bitch I'm going to need a number 3 no pickles
This is too accurate ,shout out to the useless immature Twitter employees that were justifiably laid off
Some of them will end up in tents on the streets of Sam Franks Disco..... Good one BB
Damn, just what I needed this morning. Keep the good stuff coming, y'all 😁
This is too real to be funny
No wonder she got fired from Twitter she wasn't even a good actor
Hard these days distinguishing parody from reality..
Blue hair and donuts in your ears is a good sign not to hire.
Very very good take on those weirdos lol.
Love the Office Space reference at 1:04
I know it was meant to be funny, but after she opened her mouth the first time I'd told her to get out.
She's for the streets
Great as always!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No joke, those morons were actually tweeting that Elon musk was starving them by removing free lunches... like are they babies? Who da fk gets free lunches, these people need to be smacked back to reality.
Recently a chat (huddle) a director (administrator) of a major nursing (skilled) facility. How he needs to clean house to solve major issues. He states "we don't say clean house" we say "change atmosphere " my brain says "your fired "
Have someone who knows how to spell English and use grammar correctly to re-write your resumes.  Get and respect a real job.  MAC's is hiring if you are educated enough to flip a burger or run a shake maker. Stay OUT of grocery re-stocking shelves, or so help me, I'll be squeezing your tomatoes in the produce section.
Accurate
🤣 reality!
LOVE the Office Space reference!!!
Where are they gonna go Amazon who wait they are doing the same thing
Tragically the college's are teaching them this stuff.  Even more tragic is corporate America is listening to these college bozos and enabling poor work mindless woke staff.
1:25 It happens everytime, i make a comment on a forum. Accidentally violate the moderator virginity for telling the turth and click BAN
Babylon!! Have you had the microagression unit look into these hurt feelings felonies that are clearly taking place?
This is documentary footage.
Whats scary is that some of these peeps got paid $200,000
We see this literally everyday in the (trigger word warning) workplace.
Musk is a genius. He pissed them all off, they all quit and he doesn't have to pay any unemployment anything. All the employees that quit were fired or quit for a reason. Plus they were making an average of $150k-$250k. Musk can get Indians for $1/week and get 80% more productivity out of them.
Gen-Z , the most useless generation in 2000+ years 😅😅
Two days off in a row...sometimes.
Elon should of brought a toilet in, cause he's literally flushing down all the turds !
Pretty sure this has been misfiled, genuinely  It's Not the Bee
Next she needs to crash on the couch of her two friends that moved to Texas and discover they are turning into, gasp, Texans
Is it okay to kill people for blackface? No, wait, for blackhands? Is it? I mean it's totally cultural misappropriation, isn't it?
This is very funny. However, I've begun to empathize with the younger people who carry these ideas around. Are they truly to blame? This kind of thinking is all they have been taught in our Marxist education system. They have been taught to blame everyone and everything for their problems. They have been fed the idea of weakness as a virtue. When I was a kid, if I got in trouble in school, that was nothing compared to the trouble I was going to get into when I got home. I was taught to take responsibility if I lost in sports or if I failed a test. I was taught to respect elders, teachers and parents. Granted, some of them abused this power and were allowed to continually abuse it. But, that only made me a tougher person as I learned how to deal with the unfair and sometimes illogical aspects of society. The truth is, we've were infiltrated a long time ago and we are now seeing the effects of that. Check out this video of KGB Operative/Soviet defector, Yuri Alexander Bezmenov, as he describes long standing Soviet Manipulation of the United States public opinion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmXiapfCs8
Nothing disgusts the supposed "voices of the working class" more than someone of the working class. They don't care at all about the working class, they just need some human pets to feel important and superior. The majority of the leftists are narcissistic, sadistis psychopaths who would not hesitate one second to deport everyone into death camps if it fits their cause.
The sad thing about the female character is that she really represents 90%+ of Gen Z in real life.  That is why this world is doomed.
Working 4 hours a week, 25 days a year, 40k with benefits. That's what I'm looking for.
That was so funny!!!!!!!  Just brilliant!
The crazy part is this is so damn true smh
Funny AF! But the scary part is that this was spot on lol.
I was watching for the satire......looked like a documentary to me.
Poor girl, we should raise everyone else's taxes so we can provide a nice apartment, smart phone, several streaming accounts and spending money so she doesn't get sad.
Yeah they decided to go in in a different direction. It's called living off their parents and complaining about not having to ever work again because it never worked A-day in their life
So true! And more's the pity.
Heehee
How was her application acceptable enough to get to the interview phase of a factory?
*imagine the theatrical drama of former twitter employees attending support groups and grief canceling sessions in person or on a live stream feed...*
Ok so I'm in IT for decades now and even I don't know half of what she said that was going on in Twitter. Was she really an employee or just a control subject for a social-engineering experiment?
Wine on tap? Christ that's just sadness from a spout right there
As a dev this hits hard
Professional useless people. Let them grow to be unhappy until they realize they have to grow up.
twitter was so woke, hilarious video
LOL!
If this was real, the guy would have told her to gtfo after first ‘oppressive colonial regime’ comment.
I do believe a LOT of cornholing went on at Twitter....
I love how they borrowed some of the dialogue from _Office Space_ and tweaked it slightly 😆
All snowflakes worked at Twitter lol
A percentage of ex twits will join the real world and learn to be useful members of society
Sounds like a university student in (real) life.
Now we know where AOC came from
The sad part that's how a lot of people are these days. I've had mom's call and show up for interviews for their kids.
1:05 office space reference
funny bc pretty much true
Sad and funny at the same time there are real people just like this.
Yep, that’s the old twitter.
Nailed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate woke entitled gen z
If you read the tweets from Twitter employees, that's EXACTLY how they think.
What would you say you actually do here?  Office Space was to true. This is even more so.
This sh!t I's hilarious 😂
Oh my god this is absolutely spot on 😁😁😁
Fuck that’s so good
That's the entire Millenial generation.
so dead on accurate describing the coddled libs
It’s sad how true it is. We’re all doomed. Soft.
She and her ilk will tuck in seamlessly in the public school system. As an oppressive white patriarchial male shop teacher with 31 years experience, I can attest...
She brought back memories of Maynard G Krebs when she reacted to the word "work".
FACT CHECK!  This is "satire".  To be good satire, there must be some truth.  You have been warned.
Absolutely hilarious ,
I know this is just acting but it sure pissed me off lol
👍😊🇬🇧😂
upvoted for title alone
Morgan's a rocket
LMMFAO!!!! 😂😂😂 LIfe is hard!  It’s harder when your a twitter employee, I mean when your stupid 😂😂😂😂!!!
these are just not funny guys...
That's about right...
I worked for a computer company in Austin 20 years ago that would bring us pizza and sodas to our cubicles, which we all took advantage of.  When I left a few years later I weighed 280lbs, lol! Took me a year of hiking 30-40 miles a week in Washington State to drop the weight.  Ironically, I started a vehicle repair business after that so I could stay active.  It worked.
"what would you say you do here" "I told you, I deal with the customer so the engineers don't have to" "So you email the customer" "No" "You talk on the phone with..." "No" "Ok, so you message or video" "No" "You have meetings with the engineers" "No" "So, what exactly do you do here" "I told you! I DEAL WITH THE CUSTOMER SO THE ENGINEERS DONT HAVE TO, do you have a free cafeteria because I'm hungry.
My 1st real full time job was working at a printing press.....back in 1985. 12 hour shifts with no lunch breaks. Ever.  And when we got behind production due to the web(paper)constantly breaking,  we'd have to work straight through the weekend.  It was common to work 30 to 40 days straight 6 or 7 times a year.  So when I hear Amazon workers complain .....🤮🤮
Miss??? Don't go there...
Lol
🤣🤣🤣
Fantastic work
I have a dream. That one day,  Trump will start wearing black face.  Just for the lulz. If Behar and Kimmel didn't get canceled....then....
I work in tech and this is 100% spot on. I'm a conservative and it's nauseating to hear these people whine and complain about literally everything. People complained about not getting lunch everyday. I've seen people renegotiate salaries because the place didn't serve free lunch. There are people who will get in Slack and straight up tell the whole company that they need a mental health day because they're so stressed. No one is actually stressed. Everyone is just super fucking sensitive and big pussies. I had to call a friend who has been in tech his whole career and straight up ask, "Is this what y'all consider 'hard work'?"
Hahahaha discrimination against lazy workers!
Great vid - she wasn't believable as a leftie though - far too hot!
For the woke work is a four letter word.
At 2:45, I thought for certain she was going to accuse them of blackface.
But but but but Trump  -Every MSNBC viewer
I am so offended that was so 20th century.
xD
When we get newbees like that , my boss sends them to me , AND I F*CKING BREAK THEM 😆
I'm afraid to even wonder what the hell a kornhol sesh is.
When the employee informed the boss about needing parts, I was expecting the  ex-twitter employee to scream out “black face !” And go on a rant about racism.
Lol, obviously these people have never worked with a workplace tax credit felon, they keep talking about playing Cornhole 😳
She's exactly like those morons I ran into outside the Starbucks yesterday protesting for a union. You pour coffee!!!! First time ever going into a Starbucks.
I couldn't work with such soft people.  Lol this was a fun watch!
She was missing the required nose and lip rings and tattoos.
I’m a middle school teacher, and recently I got dinner with two girls that worked at urban outfitters corporate side, and they were literally describing their jobs like this. Drinking during their working hours and playing cornhole…. Coming in at like 10 and leaving by 3
Five seconds in I would have said "get the fuc$ out"
god damn .. she's good in acting like an insufferable stuck up "progressive" ..
Dorsey, a guy who has attended Ayn Rand conferences, started that crap. Shouldn't that have raised a cosmic divide-by-zero exception?
We had a secretary who stayed on the phone making personal calls and wouldn't answer the phone when someone called because she said the calls were for one of us, so we should answer the phone.
This is just too funny lol
The opening screen of this video made me laugh out loud, but it was painful to watch. I was so embarrassed for her. 😨 Good luck, Nandy!😆
Hard to know if this is satire as this seems like the real thing...
A lot of useless children are moving back in with parents.
Did they really have AA meetings. That sounds legit, but this is satire; but this one almost seems not be satire
"Bam" then back to "cornhole" 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
As someone who was permanently ejected from Twitter, after 13 years of (non-spamming non-swearing ) posting & commenting, just because I obviously had upset the woke libtatards,   ..I defiantly, approve this message.  😂👍
It’s funny because the actress looks like Lena Paul. (Porn actress) ((Not that I watch enough porn to know porn actresses by name))
These liberals in USA are really spoiling the name of Hindus and Buddhists arent they?
Nailed it....
Mj is such a treasure 😂
Nice office space reference. “What would ya say………..ya did there?”
Wow. What a beautiful documentary
At 1:00 the boss channeled 'the Bobs' from _Office Space_ with the line, 'What would you say, ya do here?'
I… uh… does ‘cornholl’ no longer mean ‘sodomy’ in common parlance? Great sketch, don’t get me wrong, but that really threw me.
I’m just here for morganisawizard.
Heard Meta is hiring.
You should make this like an actual series: -twitter employee applies for office job -twitter employee applies for teaching position -twitter employee applies for IT job
Shout out to the Office space reference, nicely done
Thanks!
fact!
Bwahahahaha!
Screw twitter and all those useless people!
You should have had her questioning why the boss was white and male
lol
Twitter employees aren't going to function in the real world for a bit... Now that they aren't at an adult daycare. Pathetic bunch of people.
You know it's bad when Starbucks wants nothing to do with them.
I assume any employer worth their salt will realise Ex Twitter employees shouldn’t be hired. They will infect the rest of the workforce. They are literally the enemy of all humans who value free speech.
Nice one adding the Office Space reference!
I actually love the babylon bee, such great content 😂 only improvement I would have made is when he said "miss" she should have told him her pronouns were they them 😂
she is really convincing
What kind of a man drinks mimosas!?!? Have a blood Mary  Ya twat
What the fuck is a cornhole sesh? When I was younger that meant you were doing serious ass stuff that you probably wouldn't talk about with anyone outside of the "lifestyle."
I've been waiting for this. 👌
Mandy is smoking 🔥
Working a real job is hard lol
The journalists are really sweating about the "learn to code" comment now xD
I can imagine if one of them went to work for me.
Chugga bunk!!
FACT CHECKERS ENGUAGE in., 5.., 4.., 3.., 2..,
Lovely day for a Guinness.
I bet she likes being cornholed!
Hopefully they all aint that way or my generation is more fucked than I thought.
Better then Saturday Night Live any day!
I got to wonder how accurate this is. It's probably pretty spot on.
I'm sure this lady will find a nice HR job lol
The Civil Service in Britain is full of these woke sort of morons and they are now trying to get Ministers of state sacked for shouting at them , i'm 66 and i've received some of the most tremendous bollockings imaginable but you learn your lesson accept it and carry on regardless
It really is crazy to think that Twitter HQ had all of that. I didn’t even know it was like that until my father told me about it and I looked it up for more info.  Like DAYUM, no wonder the workers loved it there! It doesn’t like a job at all, more like a workplace paradise!
I like the subtle nod to Office Space at 1:05. The Bobs would be proud
I was told that JIRA ticket time estimates were oppressive and discriminative today...this woke to the power of two.
Its unbelievable how so many people take home big salaries and literally do nothing. I'm glad Elon is firing all these lazy, unproductive freeloaders. They shouldn't have allowed Twitter to turn into one big, luxurious break room.
who would ever interview a fired useless twitter employee? they did very little apparantly and were entitled woke idiots that NO ONE needs on their team.
Yeah!  It’s fucking Morgan!  Congrats on making it to YouTube.
The ticking time bomb is we have an entire generation of young people who learned that it's not necessary to actually know anything. Why bother troubling your brain when everybody knows you can just go to Google or Wikipedia and find the answer to any question.  The flaw to that approach is that in order to formulate a question, you actually have to know something.
I love it when people make fun of the idea of "trigger words"
Propaganda channel
The employee got fat paid there which is why they THINK it's not a big deal they just got shit canned. When their new job starts & their new boss requires the same shit elon just dropped on them, the reality starts to sink in. They HAD one of the cushioniest jobs on the planet. Those 10+yrs WERE the easiest yrs of their life & they milked the shit outta it lul
This is my little brother.
bravo Bee
Meditation room is cool work hard there and meditated
Hell thats 75% of young people for real today. more pay less work and they want to be the boss.
Hipsters. xD
I had three female 26-year-olds that I hired to help me with my daily living activities, as I have physical problems. One was terrified of touching a cobweb, the next refused to use a fork as the package instruction said, and then announced that she would watch me do the work. The third ran out in terror when she saw a tiny mouse. We were going to set a trap for the mouse, but she never came back.  I think it's significant that all three were 26 years old, the age when they no longer can get health insurance living in Mom's basement.  Watching your mom cook is not the same thing as doing the cooking yourself.
With the grease.    I thought she was going to react to black face 😱
Ha ha ha Twitter employees need to learn to do real work
I would like to laugh and all, but it is actually so real and beyond being said that I simply can't . . . and this people are our future . . .
I read something about a barista strike at Starbucks. Maybe she could find an opportunity making foamy milk lattes
Hopefully Tesla has a good year and Elon can buy the u.s. then close half the government
😄
In 2022, is it inappropriate  to say that she is hot? Come to think of it, I don't care. She's hot.
And here I thought a job at Twitter was more intense than a job in defense/aerospace. Wine?  Free food?  So cushy. I  Whelp, you can’t have Trump jobs in a Biden economy, so time for that all to go.
Well Done Elon Musk, Showing the real world how useless these Twatter employees are - get back into the real world you pathetic waste of space people.
Its funny! The real world is these types of peoples kryptonite. All "jobs" like twitter shouldnt exist. Manual labor for these weaklings. Pansies.
"What would you say you did there?". Love the Office Space reference there
I'm willing to bet folks in these comments don't even know a single Twitter employee, yet are talking smack like they know the building top to bottom 😂
She's oddly attractive.
those twat waffles wouldn't be able to integrate into real society, this video is 100%.
Wow, a real-life documentary. I was expecting a skit.
LOL'd at BYOG.
I can see that the "RUB n TUG" parlours will be getting some new broads !!!
What's the problem? She sounds like a Marxist, Socialist, Communist, Lazy Democrat to me. No surprises.
I honestly thought she was also gonna be disgusted by the ring on his hand too because he's most likely a straight white male who's married to a submissive woman, but that might've been overdoing it.
I may disagree with some things you say on YouTube, but that was seriously fun acting MJ.  The Woke provide us with plenty material to laugh at them. 😁
Honestly, people who do content verification and moderation have a super hard job. This funny video could not be further from the truth.  Most people can not do that job for long because they have to see unspeakable things. But it is a job that needs to be done. Or do you want to see the beheading of innocent people or child porn or gang rapes. Or do you want that your children see that?
Lool 10/10 to the performance of the actress . I’m so glad the entitled brigade who lounged at Twitter as none of them actually worked without having to go to a anxiety cubicle are actually working and learn what normal people have to do, and they will be jobs that finally represent their merit not what they feel.
Well while some might enjoy zhe comedy of that video, the reality is, these are software engineers and data scientists 🤡🤣 babylon bee is made out of failed right wing comedians while twitter employees actually studied mathematics and science 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 now thats pure comedy
Mr Dunsenson : "you know, you're twenty minutes late." Twitter airhead just smiles, oblivious to the point of Mr Dunsenson's comment. 🤣
The fact that Twitter is still operating fine without these people is hilarious.
Would've been funny if the company was called dunson & sons and she mispelled it with "dunsonsons"
Not funny, you guys. Censoring people and squelching ideas are hard work. Constant surveillance is tiring, crushing dissidents is fun but messy sometimes (just ask Stalin), and licking liberals' boots leaves a stain on the tongue.
So satisfying watching the Twitter meltdown and all the little assholes crying and getting fired.  Fuck'em.
I hope Elon Musk takes over YouTube and fires all the wokes so people can actually put videos on without getting band over stupid stuff
Wow how do you get this leaked footage???
Where’s the blue hair?
Thank gosh I am into agriculture and fish farming buisness. 😅
They should have given her short blue hair and a covid mask, but still quite accurate!
Did anyone else catch the subtle nod to "Office Space"? 😁
I have worked in IT for over a decade now. I have never seen any job with so many benefits. I have no idea what these people did there but it wasn't IT work.
I noted the office space reference which gave me a smile but I can’t understand what they mean by cornhole? Doesn’t that mean anus?
Typical lazy libtard
I see a lot of Twitter bums walking straight to welfare...permanently!
I thought she was outraged by the hand black face.
I knew things were going downhill in 1995. I was an engineer where they had had hired lots of college freshouts. One day I was in front of 4 young ladies who were walking up to the door of a facility and I held the door open as I would for anyone. One of them said "Do you think because I am a woman I am incapable of opening my own door". I pulled the door shut behind me.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Bullet dodged... =)
Yea, I have a feeling a lot of those people fired from twitter will have a difficult time finding employment.
Morgan and Chandler are naturals on playing the "Liberal White Girl" role Awesome acting
Happy--uh, NICE ending!
She represents the entire gen z
That is probably more truer than we could ever imagine.
Like Idiocracy (2006) this channel is slowly going from comedy to documentary
I enjoyed this documentary
Is that MRE for lunch??
So we are simply accepting Elon Musk's views about the work situation at Twitter? Then I really hope you all end up working under a boss with the same charmig ways of bossing his employees around. I mean, 80 hours work weeks? What maniac would accept such a deal? In my view, Musk has already disrupted Twitter beyond repair. He is like a Rhino in a porcelain factory.
This is a documentary.
Millinials, gen z  gen x are useless
Surprised she didnt go wild when he said miss. Twitter slags are all her/she or thing/twat
Twitter - CIA asset posing as a tech company.
That was 99% accurate.  The 1% that was off was her/it/they/xer/ipad/woof actually showing up for an interview.
This would be funnier if it wasn’t so close to the truth.
I though this was supposed to be a comedic sketch. Not an actual work interview.
Chills. This is too real.
no comment. you said it all kkkkk bravo
I am the in house sommelier...
😂GOD bless you for standing up against these woke creatures ,,
Wtf was that ending
This is hilarious 😂 two thumbs up 👍 ! More please 🙏 ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Hilarious 😂 I wonder 💭 which Morons 🤡 will hire these ex Twitter 🐦 workers ! Oh wait ! We still have Google and Tik Tok ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Hilarious 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Hahaha ex Twatter employees that now have to work more than 4hrs a week 😅
Leftoids aren't offended by grease because it's dirty, they think it's a failed attempt at blackface and get triggered.
The title reflects my view about the social value of Twitter.  None whatsoever.
She wouldn't stick around to watch two grown men cornhole each other. How homophobic.
There's a recent TikTok (where else) video of a young Starbucks employee crying because of how busy he is and they have him working 25 hours a week - including two eight and a half hour shifts. He needs a dose of the Chinese 9 - 9 - 6 work system i.e. 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. 6 days a week.
I'm sure they can all learn to code.
It's a good thing gays and Trans people never worked at any of my jobs ! It' be comedy GOLD all day long !!   Making fun and sport of those people!!
I dated that exact woman for 2 months. What a trip.
That's awesome!!
Why do I feel like this is actually what will happen when they go to get a real job 🤣
It would be funny if it wasn’t so true 😢 these people really are going to struggle to find a job… I feel bad for them… sorta
You make documentaries now ? 😅
SHE CAN PASS PAPER TOWELS TO PATRONS USING THE TOILET ...JOB OPENINGS..🤪🤛
i laugh so hard 😂😂😂
Brilliant.
Sad but true
Love the Bee, but this won't age well. Musk fired 88,5% of the employees - even an idiot CEO will tell you he's insane.
Elon should have sent those fired employees to the local Labor Ready Daily Work,Daily Pay and see how they cry like little bitches.
I thought she would see the "black" hand on a white guy as a racist act.
My current job as a maintenance mechanic had one of those woke non binary  ass clowns pretending to be a electrician..happy to report he she it no longer has a job...
There’s always a demand for lavatory cleaners!  Seriously though, this is frighteningly realistsic.
This why , when  the purge  comes, it's  gonna be so much fun. Can't wait .🙏🙏🙏🙏
I just want to thank the guys who made this video
How come this is so on point...?  I guess the worlds going to crash soon for lack of supply unless cobots replace the woeful hopefuls. Demand for * real laborers* will be a deep chasm.
😂😂😂
I thought cornhole meant asshole?
Watched this at work, laughed so much I nearly spilled my mimosa
Ironically funny how a satire video of those people could also be used as a mini documentary for social studies.
More please!!
Whatever will they do without their free lattes?
Too soon BB. Too soon. (And too true)
As a machinist it was impossible to do the job and not get dirty.   The government lady wanted us to bring more women onto the floor.  Most wanted me to help them do their job so they wouldn't get dirty which would hinder me at getting my job done.
Excellent!
This is scary because it's real.
LOL :D
"What would you say ya did there?"  Love the reference to 'Office Space'!  😆😆
Pretty much sums up most modern kids.  As someone who has employed dozens of young people over decades I can assure you that they have been getting progressively worse.
I cant stop staring at her one enlarged nostril...
oh no sympathy for this gigantic shit show getting shut down I think it's funny that people are actually defending the Twitter employees that ran the shit show it's the only place you could get censored for saying something and it doesn't follow the elites but yet you can share nudity all day and look up as much porn as you want to 😂
People who are this useless, man...
Knew a girl who came into the office, worked for 10 minutes, then went to her car for a few hours to play with her phone. This was every single day for a couple months before managers noticed and fired her. Same as the entitled twitter work ethic
Lots of people are losing their jobs and the remaining workers are made to work 12 hours without any extra salary... And every comment in this video is making fun on them. Tells me a lot about that capitalist nation. I am very thankful that i Don't have to live in that shameless country.
LOLOLOLOL
Sadly this is really how most of these  liberals act smh..
Comment for the algorithm
What if he had Grease of his face?!
He definitely tried to oppress/assault/rape and or dead name her. Cancel his access to twitter/facebook/instagram/youtube/bank accounts/publuc transport/municipal facilities/voting/breathing.
The end is the best part lol.
Your channel ROCKS!
As if any of these people actually need to work, they all have rich parents.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Haha, I'm from Fruitport, MI. Poor Steve!
What would you say you did there :).... Great reference haha
Now i want continuation of her looking for job 😂😂😂😂
Work.... tasks done
She looks a lot like Lena Paul
hjahahaha
This is about as funny as hearing your child has a terminal illness.
Hahaha, rooftop corn hole sesh made me gleek on my keyboard. 🤣
Another killer test of a person's suitability is how they handle greasy foo, like fried chicken.
Cornhole? I need some TP
She is so good at acting like a professional useless person.
What shocked me the most was the ring on his finger! It could easily get ripped off or degloved!🤮
Brilliant ! but sadly true .
think of it this way. a bunch of chefs need jobs now so if your restaurant has a shit chef you got a bunch of new good ones.
It will be funny to see what these twitwits do in the coming recession when the tech giants mass layoff their staff, and the twits are unqualified to even scrub toilets.
Does make me wonder with so many loosing their jobs at Twitter, where are they actually going to try to go?  Another tech company?
Show them a bit of hand grime and they run a mile. I had many experiences with while collar staff. One actually cut his finger on a piece of paper. We laughed and laughed, he went and hid in his  office somewhere, never to be seen again. Bloody big sook.
The funniest bit is that it is actually true; that’s how libtards behave
The actress is phenomenal! I was genuinely hating her! That means she acts very well! Good job Babylon Bee! Hope she gets more future projects! 👍🏻
Gold.
Beautiful and spot on
SUPPORTING THE FINE INSTITUTION WHILE SIPPING MIMOSA FOR SURE
This is what you get when you use child-safety caps/lids to side step natural selection. An entire generation that would not have naturally made it past 13.
Sad truth people are hurting for employees so bad they may still hire her
Accurate.
I wanted a Twitter like job
best thing since the microwave
The best perk I ever had was free expired food.
Great acting, guys!
I love this video and share this quote with you too, “A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.” —David Brinkley...
Actually workers clean their hands before desk work or taking a piss.
They drink mimosas at BB????? I'm done!
For real, I have worked with people like this, no work ethic. Very frustrating to work with them.
She looks like Lena Paul, so..... ZIIIIPPPPP..... I'll be busy for a while guys.
This video did nothing but reinforce my pre-conceived notions about the current mindset of most Twitter employees. Thank you for doing this as I needed a really good laugh. 😆
These fired twitter employees will have a very difficult time reintegration into society.
Did Babylon Bee get unbanned yet on twitter?
This would be hilarious, if it weren't true.
I figured she was going to complain about the hand being “black” as some sort of racist black face.
What's her pronouns?
i read that as " Twitter lays off half the WOKEforce"  😂
Best video ever!
You know it’s staged satire….. but also you there’s a growing cult out there that aims to behave exactly like that.
Mimosas!!
Where's my adult day care, babylon bee?!
Lol, was that a nod to Office Space at 1:07?
Working at the Babylon Bee looks even more fun then working with my Air Force buddies.  Very good work, and soooooo funny!
I love Tesla, but Musk is a MAGA dictator wannabe… Billionaires are WORTHLESS, EMPATHY-FREE HUMANS, only concerned about their next billion, at any and all costs to the planet and its inhabitants.  Imagine going to sleep every night knowing your billions were multiplying while being able to end world hunger without making even a noticeable impact in your finances but choosing not to…   #BillionairesAreWorthlessHumans #WorstHumansOnEarth  Call me overly positive, but I think we’re leaving the era of ‘greed is good’ and celebrating wealth and entering an #EraOfAltruism and equality. Let’s #AutomateEverything and #SkipToAbundance.  NEVER give microphones to Nazis planning civil wars!    #EatTheRich #EqualityMovement #OneEarth #SomosUno #DEMEXIT #StillSandersPlatform #RepublicansAreNazis #MuskIsMAGA
🤣👏👍
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And yet many of these people would have families to support. Not overly funny really.
why do you always have to shit on hinduism and yoga though ? seriously
Learn to work
Back in the day when your worst employees just stole $1,000 from stationery. Instead of today, they steal oxygen
If you want a paycheck-paycheck, you have to work-work, at the job-job.  If your trully worthless, you might actually have to break a sweat doing manual (hands on physical work, like the gardener at your parents) labor.
If you dont like the new Twitter, start your own social media.
LOL  That was solid!  Laughed at the way she reacted to those greasy hands!
Worked for a sheep farmer for three years. He made cheese from the sheep milk, and his wife had a bakery. So every once in a while we’d take home some really great cheese, we never wanted for bread, and they tried to give us a pure breed Great Pyrenees puppy as a gift.  Gonna take a rain check on the puppy till we get some land.
As always, funny because it's true.
That pallet leaning on the wall is an OSHA violation. Such attention to detail.
🤣🤣🤣
Bourgeois parasites. The irony.
Kinda cool , but you sold  out at the end  .
accurate but not funny at all.
That AA drop was…probably the most unexpected thing I’ve ever seen from one of the Bee’s videos 😂😅
😂 why does this satire strike me as way to close to reality?
…they should make an entire series of Twitter employees looking for new jobs. So awesome!
So that was satire, right...right?
Just bloody brilliant mate!  Cracker job!
Omg love it guys 😂
Not many companies hire communists, but some still do. Good luck Marxists!
Muwhahahahaha, Totally depicts the labour force of today.
Lmao!
Very well done, however there are many folks just like this, who seem to get the idea they can get paid for doing next to nothing, not work a full shift, & come in late, if at all & leave early.
Please tell me that's not how all former Twitter employees mindset to work is?
🤣🤣👍
Reading the comments on this one is as satisfying as the sketch itself
Imagine if Elon hires The Babylon Bee to make an announcement video
Is it really that bad? If there are so many useless people in useless positions in twitter, how can it even survive that long?
11/10. Can't wait for the starbucks version.  (if it isn't already done).
😂😂😂
Loved the Office Space reference: " So what is it you actually DO there?"
The patriarchy strikes again!
Let’s be real, she’s a receptionist part time if lucky
When the guy had motor oil on his hand, I was expecting her to scream - "OMG BLACKACE!"
My father was an Arizona farmer/rancher. He taught me and my 6 brothers how to work hard. I did the same for my 5 children, now in their 20s and 30s and all successful. My oldest son (in medical school) came to me last summer and told of his two best high school friends who ski and play video games all day at still haven't graduated from the community college at 30 years old. He ended with, "Thank you, dad, for teaching me how to work."
I am betting most of those laid off and those that quit today will be regretting their decision and the decision to demand Musk keep them on and allow them to work from home soon as they won't be finding too much work like it since Facebook and Google are laying off. Gonna be a tough labor market, I mean getting things done market out there for them.
hahahaha super funny... LoL
.........and you expect the new generation to accept the Constitution.........or read it? LOL
That little reluctant applause at the mention of AA was genius.
for people outside the us what's a cornhole session because all the things that come to my mind is probably not correct or at least i hope not
The hand shake part was hilarious.
I thought the thing on the worker's hand that shocked her was the marriage ring
How do these people even survive?
Hope the can'ts starve in the coming recession.
You guys are the best!!! This too funny.
Is it really true that twitter employees really don't work?
It makes me struggle to think of how many software developers you would need for a site that could be written in a couple of days.
That part where he says "what would ya say... ya did there?" Is a definite reference to one of the 2 Bobs from the movie "office space" asking one of thr guys "what woukd ya say... ya do here?" Its a great movie and maybe they didnt even do it on purpose but my brain instantly connected that lol
I think I know her? germaphobe named jennifer. lmao. such a pleasure to see crazy people go away.
the fact the boss started using synonyms for work, just to accommodate her, scares me!
Perfectly topping chaps....
this was good and pretty sad that it is true, also your women are guns video was hilarious I could not stop laughing, thanks guys.
NICE OFFICE SPACE REFERENCE!
I'm just imagining the meltdown she'd have when he told her the work... err labour... stuff week was an 8 hour a day 5 days of the week thing.
loll too cool
Hilarious how blue collar workers are always commenting on how white collar and university students are not as intelligent as them. It's such an obvious cope that it's kind of sad. While I do agree college and white collar individuals are wimpy and naive about many things, you guys on average are not as intelligent. Also, the comment about the ex twitter employee drug use is super ironic. Everytime I get any where near a construction site, I always find liquor shot bottles on the ground. Get real.   I'll leave this here so you guys can understand yourselves a little better:  https://youtu.be/oFL5NoM9GVE
On paint lol
My thoughts and prayers to those current and ex twitter employees who finally have to start working for living.
I thought she was freaking out over his wedding ring. 😅
Oh Babylon, your the bee that just keeps on giving!
Another sad thing is the layoffs at Amazon, most businesses went under and they were the only place left for people to work. Killed the local economy and then left the region bare. Reminiscent of the coalmines.
I'm surprised she didn't call him racist for  doing black hands I don't think she is woke enough!
The announcement at the end of BB's videos 🤣
That was absolutely amazing 😂
Entirely believable.
True story.
Too realistic.
And that's EXACTLY how they are. I was with my family at a restaurant last week waiting for our table and a couple came in and sat next to us. The guy was wearing a MAGA hat and when I waved hi to him and just said "nice hat," my sister jumped up and stormed out. Took my brother-in-law fifteen minutes to find her and calm her down enough to come back in. By then, the couple had been seated... apparently far away from us.
Lmao
👍
Way to funny
I actually believe that more jobs need to embrace flexible scheduling and flexible start times.
u see twitter on a cv.  trash it.
As a parent, we can’t always blame the young generation. We also have to look at how the parents raised these child-adult people 😂
About three years ago, before I had (wisely) retired, we had to let a twenty-something software contractor go after about a week because the guy spent about 7 out of every 8 hours "at work" playing World of Warcraft on his work laptop. He was surprised that we knew about it, like 1) we couldn't see his complete lack of work output, and 2) we didn't have network administrators that could monitor his network traffic and see exactly what he was doing. I don't know what was worse, his laziness or his stupidity. How he got past the hiring manager, I have no clue. I guess he knew the right buzzwords.
Best perk: In 2016, since I only interacted with other coworkers in other states I convinced management to let me work from home fulltime. Used "cost savings" as my angle. I've been working from home ever since.
When parada becomes reality.. How far Western society has fallen is sickening af...
Too funny 😂😅😅
I’m sure it would,be more unbelievable that this wonderful skit
The only "real" work they did was Banning people and Censoring
I thought she was gagging because he assumed her gender by referring to her as "Miss".
Should be: "Twitter Lays Off Nearly Half of Its Wokeforce"
Morgan nailed it
Sad but true. As a Millennial with common sense, I'd like to apologize for my generations stupidity.
It's funny with all the other big techs doing massive layoffs to all these poor Twitter people gonna find out how the real world is
That's mos def not parody that's them people 100!
So, turns out cornhole is a game where you try to throw a bean bag into a hole on an angled board. I totally thought it meant something else ...
Sadly this generation in their 20's is so soft and virtually useless ... soon the world will chew them up and spit them out ... will be quite a wakeup call!!!
Twitter employees are gonna have mental breakdown after finding that starbucks does have meditation room
Lol...always funny.
Haha
So quick bee, well done
Pretty much sums it all up!
how was their other job not real
So classic.  ❤️ ya Babylon Bee
I'm kind of surprised that she didn't say that she was just going to go back to her mom's basement.  Lol
Does anyone know how to be a non useless person without getting cheated at the workplace because the comments 🔥🔥🔥
Funny or true the fact remains that twitter was a company made by those people and while they were in it. It sold for 44b $ because of them. Proof is in the pudding... Elon did just one thing these past 2 weeks. Fire them and the value of twitter is now... 8b.Down 80%. He lost 400k $ value for each employee he fired. And another 100k he has to pay as severance. its not even funny. maybe its not just elon that will go bankrupt but USA as a whole. Wonder how many of u jokers here would cost ur boss half a million by getting fired. U r not witnessing elon putting twitter in order.... U might be witnessing the start of the biggest recession in USA history. Just this month due to elon musk's action alone unemployment in usa went up by 7% and ur gdp fell by 5 % cross your fingers and pray 2 God 2 spare u from elon going bankrupt. Because he is dead set on it. If elon goes bankrupt usa might just follow suit.
More correct than we'll even ever know.
It's strange seeing Elon, a man once dislike by right wing supporters, now they praise him, because he got richer and louder.
"labor stuff" 😂
love the ending.
I want to see what she does next!  :D
The end was priceless....lol.
THIS IS 100000000% TRUE! Every Twitter employee acted this way.
Like that sounds like work.?! Like ya know.  Really. Ugh !
I wonder if they put twitter on their resume. Bet they don't haha
So great
Got what is actually deserved!
Reminiscent.
If someone like that actually did go to work, how much danger could they cause to other employees by not engaging in work safety ?
My god this is funny, but at same time, very sad the state we got ourselves in
I have mental disabilities that keep me unemployed but I did a lot of volunteer work at a library before the pandemic hit and not once did I ever complain about a job I had to do.  In fact on some days there was so much work to do that I chose to stay an extra hour to get it caught up before my dad picked me up.  So for employees like this I have one question. "What's your excuse?"
Left her basement and ventured outside for the first time in 10 years.
Hahahahahaha!!!!
I missed the green ugly hair and nose rings.
To all those ex-Twitter employees who are seeking employment I can only say "Learn to mine coal"
Is that MJ?
What in the world is she doing here? She trying to get a job in a car repair shop?
Jack ran Twitter like a brothel... what a disaster... Elon is having to throw so much trash out of twitter...
This needs to be retitled to today's generation looking for a job
LMAO.  Well done Bee!
People like this don’t exist, do they?
I wouldn’t hire one of these twits
Oh man she is good at this
Remind me to retire pronto! I had no idea work was so cringe!!!
Replace “Twitter employee” with “anyone under age 30”…
Spot on!
She didn't report them for using blackhand?
Fantastic vid!  I caught the Office Space reference as well 😉
We are hiring welders here.
The ending was my favourite part 😂  I got the mimosas!
The horror.
That was so well done!
I'm still surprise that she even showed up for the interview! MJ nailed it, she was quite convincing!
Yeah, do more!!!!
Brilliant ! So glad the "Woke" are going to have to wake up to reality.
Clean the swamp!!
I live these videos so much!!!
I want to thank Elon Musk, for returning all those people to their rightful position as bag-blowers.
This is what USA colleges are creating; worthless parasites on society. Parents, don't waste your money.
Wait you got unshadowbanned or why were you in my recommendations?
They can always apply for TikTok!!!! They’d be at home there!!!!!🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Sad and not funny because even though this is parody, its real life shit happening everyday! We are so fucked!
More great stuff, so much better than SNL!!
I blame the adults running these companies, they let these useless dweebs get away with being useless dweebs.
BAM!!!! You're fired!!!
I was expecting a joke about blackface when he held up the hand covered in grease
Shout out to my man Steve from Freeport Michigan, you know he banned.
😂😂😂😂😂👍👍
😭😭😭
This is one of your best !!!
the short version of my story is: new guys come in to the shop (heavy trucks, semi's and such) wearing slacks and dress shirts and surprised when they are told they need to service a semi tractor. we actually got one of them under a truck to pull the drain plug.... the oil missed the pan and he ran. LOL LOL LOL. I don't remember seeing them later
Sounds about right.
I bet navy seals pinned down by multiple terrorists trying to literally murder them and their fellow soldiers are thinking, you know, at least this isn’t as bad as having to stop my afternoon corn hole ses to push a button to ban someone on Twitter
The Twilight Zone😂 That girl should be awarded Best Actress❤
Seriously though, where can I get a job like that... asking for a friend...
Lol
I didn’t like how the interviewer caved to the interviewees Paradime saying sorry every time he made an error (from interviewees point of view). Trigger words and safe spaces don’t belong in the real world. Everyone is free to say thanks but piss off if they don’t want a job, and this person wouldn’t ever be capable of holding one. 🤦🏻‍♂️
😂
I know Steve from Fruitport, MI. He still hasn't gotten over being banned.😁
I came here for satire all I got to see were  real life useless Twitter employees lol
BYOG 🤣🤣
LMFAO!!!! You guys are good! 👏👏🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is just hilarious.
If these folks aka  " content moderators" have any backyard at home, start learning to grow some vegetables. It may be of some use to some one 😀
The other platforms that's really plagued is YouTube.
Political ideology has its place but I don't think making fun of someone getting fired is a nice thing to do. Families are getting affected here. Don't know about the management side but on engineering and technical side twitter has got some of the most skilled persons in the field and such skilled persons are now jobless. I don't think it's ok to make fun of them.
In their defense, some jobs NO you do not need to go in to the office; computers, programming or IT. Which is good for the employer less office space needed.
01:57. Job interviewee LITERALLY uses job interview as an opportunity to sell merch. Respect! :P
I spent 2 years repairing heavy equipment.  I decided tracked vehicles suck. I went back to college and said "I'm never working on tracked vehicles again."  I'm happier in my new field...but I would probably be making more of I had stuck with heavy construction. 😕
HaHaHaHa... at 1:05 minutes the Job interviewer asks "What would you say YA DID THERE?" is so iconically recognizable to OFFICE SPACE Movie.  Here is the clip.  HaHaHaHa   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkmuI5W694o&ab_channel=philiployd
I wonder how many Tech company's HR's have an Automatic "Do not Hire" policy if they see an applicant has "Twitter" listed on their Resume.
At my job, we have a ping pong table and an arcade... Literally all you have to do is limit the time you use them to the leftover time from lunch and maybe two 15 minute breaks around the day. That's hardly crunch (When we do crunch, those devices don't get touched for weeks)
Damn Lena Paul has lost weight and gotten into more traditional acting. Good for her.
She’s sounds like my dumb Arse Commi loving Democrat Sister-in-law
I cant wait for the followup in two weeks when she has not received her check for her time spent at the interview and travel costs.
While I understand the joke, we need to stop adulation of Elon like people. This is how entitled people are encouraged. Politics is no reason to support the indefensible!
Here I thought she was losing it cause the dude had a ring.
*November 4, 2022:* *Twitter lays off nearly half of its' wokeforce*  there, fixed it for ya
The sad thing is this is fairly legit for what the typical Twitter employee did.  Most were just use activists.
You know, she's going to sue & own the company later. After all, that cis white male did assault her with that...what's it called? Handcis? No...Patrishake? Hand Shake!  He assaulted her with that hand shake.
#LearnToWeld
The plot twist at the end though. 😂
This was great!! Keep it coming!!
She represents Gen Z perfectly 😂
We laugh, but if you could get away with it you would too lol
Hippie Heaven
ha ha ha
what is it you say you did there?   lowkey best reference
elon: 1 programmer has 10 managers to hangle him/her.. omg... too much instructions and not enough work done
these people should be dragged in the street and flogged publicly 🎉
Have a friend that has a Burger King franchise and he's started hiring only older retirees because the 'youth' of today don't show up regularly, want to spend all shift on their phones and are clueless in counting change, if the register didn't say what the amount was they can't count to 100 to figure it out. He's checking out all the automation /robots coming along because he figures the robots are cheaper than the personnel hassles, payroll and payroll taxes.
Woke work environments, play the game and everybody wins except, freedom from a manipulative media touting Globalist agenda.
Who is the actress?
1,000 ex Twitter twats about to become transgender using on of the 97 different official transgender options and 19 different official sexual orientations SF has just adopted to give free income to.   I kid you not.
This is unrealistic. Small companies are just as toxically woke as larger ones. I'm glad they didn't go for low hanging fruit and make fun of service industry workers. They bust their butts for low wages and don't get the respect they deserve.
Working in factories suck. I did for 5 years and would never work in one again. They treat you like a slave, pay is terrible, and hours are aweful!
Great wrap up!
I'd believe the whole Twitter staff cornholed this moron .
I will admit Twitter looks like a nice place to work but I still enjoy my bricklaying job
Awe poor baby! Are you missing those free lunches, working from home and days off during the week? No fu(ks given.
White people 😂always loosing with white women 😅 the star all western ideas 💡
Wait, I thought BB was parody? This is just real life.
Yep...
We had a new employee who showed up, stuck her large laptop on the desktop, clearing away work to be done, and said she had to do this to keep in touch with her family, since they all had mental and physical issues she needed to keep on top of. I just opened the door and asked her to remove the laptop to her vehicle.  I stared at her with my best Hannibal Lecter look. Never had another problem with her as I "met" her on her leftie psycho level.
I got mad just watching her 😂😂. Great acting!
Fruitport, MI with the mention!!! 🤘🏼
Yeah....there is only one kind of job she is good for. Ands then, it still may not be worth it anyway.
Who knew that having tattoos and a bad haircut wasnt enough to qualify for a 100,000$  job in high tech.
Y'all mfers just jealous, yeah work harder for your corporate overlords they don't give a fuck lol
All they have to learn to say is.Would you like to supersize that.
I'm offended she didn't get offended when he called her "Miss" at the end. How dare he?!!
Turns computer lovers into farm handler's.. I bet you that will see how hard is work life is.
I never thought America would ever go this direction. Growing up through the 80s and 90s I never imagined all of this woke bs its saddening and nauseating
Ladies and Gentlemen:  You are funny as hell.  Really like the booze and mindfulness ref.  Gut busting.  Your guys rock.
1:05 Office Space vibe
Should have given her the ok sign before she left the office
Amazing as always.
We are slaves
Realistically she'd be sitting on welfare collecting from men who are productive humans.    This is why I don't vote at all.    No is here for male taxpayers.
Ok...I had to google "corn holing"....and narrowed it too one of two things. 😯
It’ll be funny watching them become homeless and starve 😂😂
Start talking like a rapper.    Typical American woman.    One of the most unattractive acts a woman can do is imitate that American music trash.
When vips came thru where I worked.  I would get as greasy as dirty as I could.  Bbecause they would always want to shake my hand
pretty sure the women in our office are just like that
And that Kids is how I met you mother. 🤣🤣
Babylon Bee is awesome!
Tell that to the 11,000 pipeline employees who were not given even symphaty . Good you are being advertised .
Cornhole sesh. 🤣
Fruitport Michigan!!!
Future delivery driver!
Maybe Twitter needed a good house cleaning.
I know it’s satire, but, it’s probably closer to reality. 😜
😆😆😆
Ongoing series!
Ok so a cornhole session….that has a few different meanings I’m lead to believe
Admit it, you would have come unglued if you were interviewing such an entitled air-head.  BRING ON TECH BUBBLE 2.0!!!!!!!!!!!
Manual labor and cornhole? Cool.
The sad part is that this is pretty real.
Learn to code 😂
This also could be a former espn employee.  At espn the more liberal you are the less work you have to do!
Perfect. Salute to everyone out there who has actually worked for a living.
Yep, sounds about right😅
I thought you guys did satire?
The part you’re missing is that this guy was seriously considering her since there is no one else… labor shortage
You do realize I have a bloody nose now cuz of this🤣🤣🤣
Half of Twitter employees got new pronouns. They identify as  was/we're 😆
This is better than The Onion. XD
Let's go, Nuremberg Trials 2.0 for violation of the Nuremberg Code!  No one is exempt from the Nuremberg Code. Not. Anyone. Not for any reason whatsoever.
Great, now what jobs are all of the teenagers with no skills supposed to do for work?
He clapped 😂😂😂
This isn't realistic at all, there's a zero percent chance a content moderation specialist at twitter would have been so attractive!
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
that b-werd was racist af
you shouldve went for the blackface angle when he showed is hand.
flexible hours
It's funny because it's true...
And the memes keeps on writting themselves! LOL
Morg that was *chefs kiss* bravo!
What the hell is a cornhole sesh??
I'm thinking about the old lib broad I made come down from her highrise apartment to grab her wine box on the curb. She forgot her ID for liquor verf and had to go back up 19 floors 😁    When she said she had shoulder surgery, I said I had knee surgery and empathized with her. "Box ain't heavy, fits under your good arm." When she said she was a woman, I said, "Good for you. So am I."   I refuse to pay a 72. ticket from a meter maid for someone's bagel, wine when they know damn well downtowns in CA are parking scams.
Paycheck
You guys are freaking genius!
you had me at triggered words :)
ahahahahahhahaaaa
The nightmare of having to work in the real world is going to be too much for those folks, Musk better get ready for all the former employees suing him for mental anguish.
I half expected them having AA to be triggering to her
Good luck finding your next job with on tap wine and yoga classes..  smh
Talk about making fun of people who lost their job, and not just because of anything like recession, but a ‘got lucky’ billionaire with the ego of a teenage girl decided to fire everyone who didn’t act along his rules of free speech, get some real content bro, and show some love ….
It's sad that this is actually accurate.
It a common saying that 10% of the employees do 90% of the work. I guess Twitter took that mantra to heart. That also means that a judicious firing of 90% of the employees won’t affect the company.
Think of this... A lot of the people at Twitter were making 6 figures. They are absolutely in for a shock when they get into the real world.
Bee Movie
BYOG?  She stole Dabo's line.
Who worked at twitter? Twits?
This is some weird pro Elon Musk propaganda.
This is really topical considering that around 35% of the existing workforce said "... I can literally get a job anywhere else and not have to work 80hr weeks for this fucking idiot who isn't even paying me overtime" and left. Yeah, it's the employee's who were spoiled children
Y’all really coming at the people who kept this thing afloat until your boy Elon came in and bankrupted that bitch in record time.
Working less than a full day, but still get a full day's pay. 😁
I was almost expecting the grease to turn into a blackface reference (this IS a former Twitter employee, after all). Was anyone else thinking that?
Lmao a job job. That's what no structure and discipline will turn people into.
You know this is what it was like. There was 6k people working day and night fighting conservative or truth seekers.
One of the best.
Shared on Twitter. 😁
Accurate. A bunch of hypersensitive sheltered hipsters who never had a real job.
THE BEE HAS TO GET MIKE ROWE INTO ONE OF THESE SNAPPY!
Back to cornhole.   She's perfect!
Nice Office Space reference.
she should lear to code like they told others
By "Cornhole" she meant it in the anal sense
Lol but accurate
Can I apply this woke work at my work?
She's hot.
Now do the same for people who make reaction videos
The sad part is that’s pretty much how I vision most of these Twitter employees are.
hmm.. not so sure about it. I took an interview with Twitter once and I did NOT get the impression they were pampered fuckwads. I got the impression that they had demanding deadlines and dealt with a lot of stress
😁
Can't wait to see them at Burger King taking my order!
imagine them getting drafted?
I guess I’m out of touch, in my time cornhole referred to anal sex, male or female. Bean bag toss was something you played at a church get-together or at a carnival. Who decided to call it “cornhole”? If someone suggested we go on the roof (or anywhere) and cornhole, I would double check the employee’s handbook or call the police!
Normal jobs usually do have meditation areas. They just call them smoke shacks or the crapper. 😃
Do you havw some canadian stickers too? Lol
Best ending ever!!!!!
I’m actually surprised she showed up without a mask and gloves then not hosing herself with antibacterial
The more hilarious part to me, is how much actual truth is in this. I worked for EA in Burnaby, Canada; and when I saw there were masseuse rooms, prayer rooms, "decompression rooms", gyms (plural), soccer pitches, an arcade, a full on multi-cultural eatery, not one but TWO starbucks, a library, and a no shit actual beer friday with all manner of dim sum and brews, and every meeting bespokly catered...  Don't get me wrong though, as a software engineer the actual work was soul sucking, long, enduring, and oftentimes bullshit; but they made a hell of a _compelling case_ to not want to go back home.  When I went to my following job (where I am currently) where it has.. effectively _none_ of that, it was oddly jarring. But this company actually wanted you to leave the office and go home at the end of the day. And I value that I a lot more.
Ex Twitter,  You mean we actually have to work??
😁👍
Future Biden tax collectors, armed!
They stole this skit from office space, but, I still appreciate what's going on lol
dirt/grease/hardwork?!?! OMG THE HORROR!
3:06 I thought she was shocked because he called her "Miss" and thus assumed her gender.
that ending was hilarious
This is almost everyone college age and under from what I gather.
so true
2:36 So... how did she got shrimp?
Work for a City government,  there are people who barely work because they are politically connected.  In a Democrat City,  you'd think no Republicans would work there , wrong.  There were s group of Republicans working there.   But why?  The bosses hire and keep Republicans, because they work.  We'd have political arguments all the time, but the Republicans did get fired because the bosses would have know one to get the work done.  Why did the Republicans put up with doing all the work.   Because the pay was fair, but the benefits were great.
I wonder how they'll fair in the forced labor camps once they bring about that communist revolution they have been hoping for?
That was funny as hell and on behalf of all those folks actually doing real work to make a living... thank you Babylon Bee for the laugh.
Lol the ending!
Having interviewed plenty of gen z’s I can sadly say this is not as hyperbolic as it should be.
This had me laughing so hard I think I cracked a rib!
New idea for a reality TV show. Have Mike Rowe get laid off Twitter employees jobs on the boats in Deadliest Catch then sit back and enjoy as the little twits curl up in a fetal position and cry for their mommies as they pine for their former Twitter lives. And who knows, there might even be the soul inspiring story of the one twit who finds testosterone deep within him and actually becomes a valued member of the fish boat crew.
Who knew the Twitter employee would get a recurring role?
When the one dude walked in I was expecting her to freak about the wedding ring and not the grease.
Mr. Dunsensen didn't even clarify Mandy's preferred pronouns!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I requested a Hennessey dispensing water cooler once.
Alright. This is getting aggravating. WD40 is not something you would find in a factory. It's a penetrant, not a lubricant. And that pallet on the wall is an OSHA violation. And grease isn't for pneumatics. This is why you got banned guys.
How dare you assume she’s a “miss”
Not Steve from Fruit Port? I love Steve from Fruit Port!
Sadly the most unbelievable part of this video is that any of those braindead  troglodytes from Twitter would take the initiative to even apply for a real job, they tend to sit with their hand out until someone puts something into it
Why is this even a video? Do people think Twitter was the first company in history to fire employees?
Knew a woman that had a dog care business. Giving them a bath grooming etc she could not fins any help. One young person came in ( late) sat on a chair and complained about how tired he was . Fired within the first hour then demanded that he be paid for a full day. A nation of pampered children that think they are entitled to be paid just for showing up. The lady eventually closed her shop due to lack of staff.
This isn't even funny because it's too close to the truth.
I was once the production manager for a major plant and I got a call from HR…”we want to put a sleep pod in the control room”. You could have heard me 5 miles away telling them to f-off. As a result I was then a marked man. 🤣
hilarious grease looked staged as much as a Twitter employee would think was normal
🤣🤣
This is obviously a total scam. He didn't even ask for preferred pronouns. Do better Babylon Bee.
Several years ago, I sas someone last about an hour at a restaurant I worked at.   Why?  She was asked to wipe down tables and thought she'd been hired to only work the til.
I ran into some lady on Twitter, I think she “was” a vp of finance or something like that. Anyway, she was talking about how brave she was for leaving and how quitting wasn’t really quitting, or something like that. I had to remind her about all the other tech layoffs and end of Q hiring freezes literally everywhere. Blocked.
😂😂😂
Office Space reference. Ya, I caught that. LOL.
This really missed the mark.. especially coming from some YouTubers. Really hope this isn't what the future of comedy looks like
Snap!
do not expect me to come to the office do you? No Oh good! Because you aren't hired
When reality is made into uh a documentary I guess
I thought she was freaking out at the ring on his finger. What kind of twisted colonialist patriarch gets married these days?
Twitter employees nightmare.  New job application reasons for leaving the previous employer : have to actually work like regular people do.
1:04 office space much?
comment is what this is
I work with people in their mid-30's to mid-40's who act like that by the way I turned 60 last month
"What do you mean I have to PAY for MY BREAKFAST?"
What is an "afternoon cornhole sesh"? Did I hear that right, do that mean what I think it mean?
The Twitter employee would not be doing meditation. It is difficult and requires serious, sustained self-discipline. But the reward can be great. Unlike Christianity's promise that Jesus will do everything for you, true practices of traditional meditation require you to be 100% accountable for yourself and your actions, as you resolve yourself to God within. You very directly face yourself in this way everyday, and in every breath if you are disciplined, rather than deferring responsibility to someone else and expecting Him to take care of you in the afterlife. Which is non accountability,  as a liberal expecting government to take care of them is non accountability, while conservative principles insist on personal accountability.   I generally support the Babylon Bee, voted for Trump, have been a life long conservative, since 1980, and also a lifelong practitioner of meditation, called sadhana. It is essentially a very concentrated practice of focused prayer. I object to it being trivialized. For it is the process of finding Christ within. And that you should not disrespect.
This legit made my entire familys day!  LOL!
So......when are you guys going to get back to doing parodys?
I enjoy how babylon bee is trying to join the right 🤣🤣🤣🤣 how bout that trump info u 2 faced
Did the greasy hand or the "Miss" make her puke?
That's so funny they had a brewery she should have said AA was a little depressing for me I like to drink a lot 🤫🤭😆😚
Surprise she didn't accuse the greese  dude for blackface (or blackpalm?)
Fun fact regarding the WD-40 can in the background.  WD stands for water displacement.  The 40 stands for the 40th attempt, trying different ingredients.  Anyway, on the 40th attempt, they created a viable water displacement compound.  Props to those folks.
I love her❤️
put every babylon bee story, video, anything into a time capsule and bury it underneath an abandoned Pamida parking lot and watch the earth veer outta orbit into a collision course with the sun once opened.
Maynard G Krebs invented the 8 hour anti-work day.
Their world came tumbling fast.
How did that tame justin trudeau cosplay scare her so much?
The most unrealistic part of this video was how understanding the interviewer was 😂
Actual fired Twitter employees watching these videos trying to figure out why they've never seen any of the fired employees on the video before...
it's probably not too far off.
She didn’t wait for the miracle to happen. She failed an AA major rule.
“Your 20 minutes late.” *smiles* that’s literally 90% of my coworkers. Even my supervisors come wandering in 10-15 minutes late. Like how important is that 10-15 minutes, actually? What’s going to happen if you show up on time? I personally just like getting in early so I can set up and plan for the day, not because I want to look good, but because it actually makes work easier and less stressful. When you have the time to put your belongings away and asses the day and use the restroom or eat something, the day is much smoother and predictable. It makes life easier. And in addition to all this, you DO look good for always being punctual and reliable which never hurt anybody.  Edit: Lol apparently that struck a nerve
Ligma
HA love it!
Why can’t she just learn to code?
😂
Think about this guys aren't you becoming exactly what you despised in those Fake liberals ? You are finding joy in their misery, those poor bustards just lost their livelihood. This was a bit cruel I thaught.
Years ago I worked for the Commuter Wing of a major Airline. So yeah the biggest Bene is we had a'Flow be Through' Agreement with the Main Line which meant we could Pass Ride throughout the System for about 20.00 Round Trip Only job I ever had where I could work a Full Shift then hop an Evening Flight and be out in LA in about 7 hours for a fun filled weekend!
Kanye please buy Parlor
Babylon Bee. I didn't know you were Elon simps. Pathetic lmfao.
1:14 - "Somedays during my afternoon corn hole sesh..." Sorry, y'all, my mind is in the gutter. I still can't get used to hearing the phrase "corn hole" in polite conversation.
The best job is no job 😂.
this is what all the men died for in 2 world wars. spoiled brats !
Dude was channeling his inner Bob and Bob, from Office Space.
Ending was trash
Bob, bob.
Sooooo good
This channels content isn’t quality commentary. Boring.
It's frightening. This is the young workforce of today.
Spot on. Its hilarious reading their post trying to make people feel bad for them🤣🤣
So….now an x Twitter worker is picking noses 👃 for a living great job 👏
I wonder what they will do next for a living... A few might go mental a couple might opt for euthanasia before they run out of money and the rest might end up in schools grooming children 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
She is so good... I found myself hating her!
A friend of mine was sent to work at home during the DemPanic.  The people from her office DEMANDED that they get webcams to show that they were actually doing their jobs.  They were afraid that, as productivity decreased, they would be accused of wasting time.
'Learn2PneumaticDrill'😁
Whats a “corn hole” sesh ? Mi uncle use to say that a lot to the indigenous  female genitalia group in his hay day …. I presumed it always to be some type of gratifying yet unethical act of lustful passion …
What's with the documentary? Bring back the humor.
She's so cute - and nice portayal of what they are probably like 😂🤣
The twenty year olds in charge of Alameda hedge fund. There will be a wrecked accounting and accountability.
😂
A million subscribers. Very good guys
I actually had a very similar job interview with an ex Obama prevailing wage employee paid 55.00 an hour to do I have no idea what from his job description. I'm a Construction Contractor and just need guys that don't cut off their fingers when using a saw.  Definitely appropriately named the entitlement generation.
I'm am an electrician that has worked on SEVERAL Facebook campuses, Google campus, and the Twitter campus. It's no joke. This video is spot on. They legitimately have bottles of Jameson sitting on their desk, Liquor cages, free sushi, breakfast bars, Starbucks, Pizza.... They don't have schedules. I'd see people at 2 am sitting in "meditation" rooms half napping, half tapping their laptop
Haha
These morons could always work as hookers, and prostitutes,  not hard work,  unless they talk while sucking,  BWAHAHAHAHAHA
Labor isn’t easy.
me work at factory. me work 9-5 very hard. people who code for big tech company dumb. Only work 80-100 hour weeks.  They lazy. Me know how to put tire on car. They not as smart as me. thats why they paid 4 times as much as me. Cuz me better and smarterer and also much harder worker.
She shounds like californians from Austin, Texas.
There was a SJW lady who went to a concrete forming company who when asked to prove she could pour concrete claimed sexism after proving she could not do the job and was not given it.  She brought in local media to GET the boss for not hiring her so the boss told the media what he was hiring for, had the applicant SJW show she couldn't do the job, and the story went nowhere.  This sketch is basically that.
I have a "real" job but I've always hated it and felt like God didn't put us on this rock just to slave away for someone else so they can be a lazy ass.  So work balance or just work until your dead like our corpo masters would prefer?  I don't think any of us are doing life right.
Can't believe she fell for that. What kind of company doesn't provide an on-site guru!
I still crack up when someone mentions a game named after a sex act.
Very cool!
This duo is awesome. They did the door to door fund her college tuition bit. Grade A gut busters
Probably true enough to be on Not the Bee  🙃
She actually sounds like a millennial than a ex-twitter employee lmao.
So realistic she was really annoying me
That was grrrrr8🤣👍
People think it's funny now but it's going to be a lot worse as this goes on. It's sad so many people are like this wtf.
Funny that start times to her imply a colonialist, imperialist regime!  I thought people like Joyless Reid said those were white supremacy traits!
Lots more people going to be living on the streets soon.
all this because the bee was banned from Twitter lolol.
Great job Mr. Musk. Keep going and fired all those woke dumbs people…….god bless you Sir!
Way too attractive to be believable
She acted well, who knows the real people maybe more than this 😝
Give her an Oscar.
Privileged little fucking pricks.
I live in the city that touches Fruitport, you leave Steve alone!
"I'm sorry, but I didn't see where your crying closets are, and I cry at least four times a day, and I if I have to come into the office twice a week, I have to be sure that there's a safe space for me to cry in. Also, I noticed you don't have a BLM and rainbow flag flying outside the office, care to please explain this horrific oversight?"
Ever see the movie the time machine written by H G Wells where a scientist invents a machine and he travels into the future and finds this race of people which are basically  worthless except as a food source for the Morlocks which just round them up This generation reminds of what those characters are worthless cattle for the Morlocks nothing more
Stick that man bun up your a-- get a real job fruit bag as of now shead there is no free lunch f off democrats
Hilarious!
satire at its best.  SWOOOSH
Too freak'n funny
Just a relentless onslaught of microaggressions !
Would make a WONDERful movie in the vein of "The Belko Experiment"
😮‍💨💨 😶‍🌫️👍 😤 make it a rooftop smoke signal sesh
Keep these comics coming, they are good source for that.
Downright hilarious.
Daycare for adult children.
Kinda reminds me of that movie office space.
I’m 60. I fall trees and operate equipment. I currently enjoy great job security because my employer can’t find qualified people to replace me. My pay has risen to a decent level because of labor market forces so I’m pretty content, but I wonder: What’s going to happen when guys like me are too broken to do our jobs and have to stop working? Unless Elon Musk can make a machine to do what we do ( heavy physical labor in adverse conditions, repair small engines on the fly, ad lib solutions to problems in the field, show up for work and press on when things are shite, all for much less than six figures) I fear that jobs like mine are going to be left undone and, humble as they are, they need to be done. Have you ever seen a Google exec competently fall a big pine or build a house? Funny video BTW.
Only actors but probably close to real. Mr. Musk did the right thing.
Elon needs to move Twitter HQ to Dallas.
The  twist at the end made me laugh so much I almost chocked on my overnight soaked  almond butter oats with hemp and chia seeds yep not really edible, but joke was to die for,  🤣🤣🤣🤣, also thanks for the excellent production
funny how everyone talks about Musk laying off useless Employee's , but no cares that Zuckerberg canned 11 000 Employee's pretty much at the same time
thought she got sick when he called her a "MISS" because she refers to herself as "WE" it was still funny though 😄
Love the quick Office Space reference.
Those trigger words...:)
"what's on his hand?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
No safe spaces.  She was totally over qualified.  Oh wait, "IT" was....
This is fantastic.
Nice nod to Office Space.
This is a violation. I approve.
1:24 kind of reminds me of laid off steel workers in the 70's.   So, what do you know about making steel? when this light comes on, i push this button, when this other light comes on i push this lever, ...
😆
You all should wipe your chins...Elon zipped up....dick riders.....conservative fascist 💩
Morgan is a wizard.
Just for the funzies, going off topic.  The pallet in the office standing against the wall is like a 10K  osha fine.
The ending🤣
As the prophet maitre’d in Ferris Buellers Day Off proclaimed: “I weep for the future”.
I cannot confirm the AA scene but everything else is true
"Rooftop Cornhole sesh" has a completely different meaning in Iran.
Learn to weld!
That was awesome Thanks WE NEED A GOOD OLD JOLLY Laugh 😂
Hat tip to Office Space.
sadly bang on
Haha! This is awesome. Praise Jesus. I'm glad you guys are producing this work. ;)
Now they finally face reality. The real world isn't going to kiss your keester and bring you latte and danishes. Get used to it.
They at it again
Just half of the employees?  WDF?!
A1 job Morgan.
Fruitport!  LUL
Love the ending. We take time off differently but all the same LOL
This is gold 🥇
When she saw the grease on his hand I thought she'd go the blackface route.
I hope you have parents or a uncle that has a basement for you to live in and is willing to  support you for the rest of your life .Otherwise your just screwed .No company will hire your woke ass
Please do a series of her applying for jobs
You lying b**** it wasn't Steve you hit it was Ed from Fruitport Michigan
I want them all Working on a OIL RIG!
I find this soo offensive! Why an employer would tell you to just do your JOB !!
Youtube did not allow this on my notifications! I am subscribed with all notifications! They do this with others I'm subscribed to that they do not like.
I love my Trump supporters, they never fail to deliver their stupidity.😂😂😂
When is TBB gonna get back to doing satire!?  It's been long enough.
Keep punching 👊 these maggots in the face Elon
You guys have zero understanding of what it is to work in the Tech world. They're all extra hard working intelligent people. Musk has made drastic mistakes and might have ultimately ruined Twitter, while hurting himself financially to the tune of billions.
I don't feel sorry for those Twitter workers at all. They are just a bunch of losers. They need to get a REAL JOB now.
McDonald and Starbucks are hiring
Morgan is my favorite actress
😂
I thought she threw up because you assumed she was a "miss"  🤣 🤣
Jajajajaja
I don't know what corn hole means now but I know what it used too mean.
She sounds like one of the developers for a game called The Isle.
does anyone know what cornhole actually means, the real meaning?? I do and it's not pretty.
Another banger!
Thank you Elon, keep cleaning up these dimwits
Wouldn't even be good on a street corner. Too lazy for it.
As funny as this is, take a look at some of the "career advisors" on Tic Toc, where they are advising how to negotiate for a $100k job and how to make demands in the interview process. It's really hilarious to look at their backgrounds where the they were an assistant Mgr for a year and a half, then some bs in LinkedIn, and after a grand total of 3-5 years they label themselves as career advisor from Fortune 500 company.
Should've had some grease on his face too. She'd call the police saying they were in "black-face"
LMAO
*And they keep claimi8ng that this is only "satire"! HA HA*
This must be a real live former twitter employee
She’s so beautiful
Lol I know the real her from twitter
Satire checked:   No satire detected.
The subtle clap at the AA coin lmao
I'm familiar with the blowing into the paper bag.
HILARIOUS!
That dude was culturally appropriating their hand makeup!
You should do a series!!! The Mandy job search series.
...and that sort of two legged dog is censoring speech for the propaganda and deceit in favor of their antiChrist client same as mentioned in Revelation2.9 in the Bible.
Remember when stuff like this used to be satire and not hilariously real?
Twitter Employee: “what was on his hand?” Kyle: “A wedding band?” TE: “🤮”
The Babylon Bee never seems to disappoint!!
I'm waiting for the wokees to ban the word MAN-ual
Shit and I still can't get my old account erased!
Omg, I just like lmao!!
I think she wanted the boss to cornhole her. I wonder if she can take a hammer handle up the poo? Don't grease it or she will flip out.
Classic !
She will just have a fantasy, and become a martyr to the nonsense generation.
That's EXACTLY how I pictured "them"...
are u ok with E M ?
:D
You r the best 😆
Haha so good. Y'all the best.
He should have said "Babylon who?"
Lol, I live in fruitport Mi, but I'm not Steve.
My hands are stained black right now from Bostic Caulking after installing windows and doors all day at new apartment complex in the works. It ain't hard to work, getting two stories up on a ladder, now that takes guts. My fear of heights sets my limit
Fruitport is pretty nice, I've had some good jobs there. Steve shouldn't have been banned, free Steve! Then those other people you mentioned, whoever they are ;)
Accurate
i wish we had natural selection for this type of behavior
They had twitter on their resume it would be sorry no
and you can picture them just like this
Real job sums up how well they did on Twitter prior.
"Afternoon cornhole sesh" LOL WTF
I work for Walmart and I put in 50+hours unloading trucks and stocking shelves. My bosses refer to me as freight killer because I can kill 6foot pallets in 15to20 minutes by myself do the math in 1hour I get 4-6 pallets done. Hard work and I get treated with respect because I enjoy what I do. Plus being a stand up comedian helps with the moral.
Thank you so much. I needed those laughs.
This would be funnier if it weren't so accurate
True story: one lady in a tech company told me that I should walk slowly when I go to her cubicle cuz she felt intimidated by the way I walk. Thank God I didn't lose my job that day.
That shit was WOKE!
Another great documentary in the life of a liberal having to survive beyond their natural habitat because of external natural forces destroying that habitat.  By the way, when did you stop doing satire and devoting your content to real stories?
Poor woke cry baby I have a crying towel for you
Literally every liberal
I wish my warehouse had mamosas
Oh this is "work work". Bout right.
I had some ,that was like this, come in for an interview. I told them to get the fuck out. Not dealing with that craziness!
1. Nobody got fired from Twitter, they got laid off. 2. There have been huge layoffs at Twitter, Amazon, and Facebook because the economy is down. 3. Vast amounts of software developers were laid off at Twitter. They are not like you rednecks who think staying at one job matters. Software developers are mercenaries and fly to the next higher paying job every year or two. 4. Software developers know way more than you, especially at producing work at an IT company. And they are in an in demand field and were given severance from Twitter, so they're all on vacations right now in the Carribean and are already being headhunted for new dev jobs.
Pure crap.
🤣😁🤣
... I heard 'cornhole', which it can't be unless that means something entirely different than what it did in the 90s. What were they actually saying? Because 'cornhole session' sounds like something you don't do in polite company
How do you get any work...egh!! Classic liberal worker responses😭
I hear Gavin Newsom and Eric Adams will both just build these former Twits a tent city in which to live.
Sadly enough, this is how this next Generation will be, absolutely clueless and useless
Not only was his hand covered in grease, but he was CLEARY throwing up a white supremacist hand gesture.
i went on a date with a women probably a good 15 years ago and we ended up in this, i dnt want to call it a debate because i was being very nice to her and just politely asking questions and not stating things or getting serious with her. but we ended up in this conversation where she was going on about how she didnt think it was fair that a job would tell somebody that they cant just stand around having personal conversations on their cellphone while at work.  and i was just dumbfounded by what she was saying, and it has only gotten so much worse.
I got my 20 year coin this year.
😂😂
lmao @ hand work. I also liked the office space references.
BYOG hah
The Democrats will give her money!!
Love the WD40 on the desk to make the place look like they know what mechanics use
This is awesome!
Is this a parody? Really?
could always come work for me.  i'll just tie a mattress on their back and have them stand on a street corner.  there's no medical care, no 401k,  but they'll meet interesting people and the perks, well, they'll get laid and pay.  best of both world.   let's stick to the good old days where women can make money the old fashion way.  don't worry, i'm a cool and fair pimp, i only want 20% to pay off them guys who makes sure nothing bad happens to women.  after all, this is just my side business i do to help ex-twitter people get back on their feet.  besides, i already have a real job.  come work for me or your other option is become a bag lady on the streets.  or, if you have a great body, nice legs, shame about the face, i'm opening up a strip club.  they need to pay off their college debt, what better way to do it by taking off their cloths so men who are old enough to be their daddy and pay off their college debt?  who knows, they might meet some old rich guy and become the next Anna Nicole Smith.  or if they don't want to stand on a street corner with a mattress tie to their back or take their cloths off cause their grandpa might be the one shoving $1 bills down their g-string, can always make movies.  they'll get laid, pay, and become famous.
How many people in these comments have actually worked at a tech company? Do you know how expensive early bad decisions are to the trajectory of a company like this? Do you know what technologies Twitter and its employees contributed to? Do you know their job stresses?   Reveling in someone losing their job is just mean, regardless of if you think they were overpaid, or not contributing - and you should care about this, because it will be you one day. I don't think coal is a sustainable industry that has a net positive impact on our country, but I think that if a coal miner loses their job they should have support from both the government and their community, training options for other jobs, and we should show them a little empathy. Everyone deserves it.
Shout out from Fruitport, MI
am i the only one that taught this was real and was about to take out the ban hammer with elon musk's name on it?🤣😂🤣
Love the comedy, not the buzzkill God talk.
So twitter was like a high-end mental institution + retirement home + rehab center prior to Elon takeover?
They're so cute 🤫
Every Twitter employee that was laid off should’ve been required to watch this video prior to being let go.
She’s got it going on
I was triggered by the excessive Corn-holing references.
now we a version  we she gets the job, but everything triggers her and she end into a existential crises.
Always great!
Does Babylon Bee have any other jokes?
Are BabylonB scripts written by actual boomers? Moderators work on 24/7 shifts, even though most of harmful content is flagged by AI models, manual review is still done by moderators. Imagine seeing the worst of humanity 5+ hours per day; these moderators must suffer a great deal of PTSD after seeing child and animal abuse, etc.... I can only imagine this has to be one of the most aggravating, possibly sickening, and thankless jobs ever. Yep, you gonna need more than meditation rooms, shrimp and on-site gurus for this one.
Hey, good thing Tik Tok is hiring engineer. So go burn down that godforsaken app.
I can't wait to hear the actual horror stories leak out over the next 6 months... after they've over stayed their welcome at the parents house.
Dam pronouns
Fired Twitter employee applies for first real job. Unfortunately MacDonalds say they're too busy to train her up to the required standard!
I think (working from home) she was talkin' about a different kind'a cornhole session
Rooftop cornhole sex?  Wtf. Lol
Woke people who watch this don’t even know it’s making fun of them
Did I hear an "Office Space" reference?
"Mandy" looks just one of our 23 year old PMs at my old job, she'd show up to work at 10 a.m., already grumpy!
the twitter generation are good for nothing but cannon fodder and fertilizer.
LOL !!!!
Nice "Office Space" reference.
… And these people are all on LinkedIn now, trying to become LinkedIn influencers and giving bad advices.
I think jobs at companies like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are some of the most sought after by techies, so Twitter probably has some of the best and brightest, who have paid their dues in experience, education and training.  I'm pretty certain that they put in intense 40+ hours per week doing actual work and maybe spend a few hours a week enjoying the amenities.  I'm guessing the content moderators work hard too. Regardless, this video was quite entertaining.
when you raise a generation of lazy useless idiots they are only god at being lazy useless idiots  maybe these ex twitter employees should learn to code
Good for Elon firing all the clowns at Twitter!
Freahag  hilarious
BRUTAL!!!  LOVE IT!!!😛
lol its funny cuz its true
joy
She is not acting, this is how those losers think.
I just interviewed a dude for the rehab i work at and it was... Ereily similar😑
They are going to starve.
Love the callback to Office Space
3:01 Any software developer currently in the job market would have gotten triggered when she said "I'm sorry but we have decided to go in a different direction".
No.... See... A real labourer boss would have just said "You're 20 minutes late." and when she gave her responce, he'd literally just say "Oh, okay. well thanks for coming in. Fuck off".   Because.... yeah. I have no sympathy for Twitter employees or people who use it. XD You're dumb.
Got to love it when people put down others simply for their jobs. Or former ones. Shame on you.
based
Almost funny...
I work in social care looking after people with learning disabilities. I clean up shit and try to avoid being headbutted. She is welcome to try the job out.......
I can't stop laughing!
🤣
Ngl, I thought she was freaking out over the wedding ring, not the grease at first. Wouldn't surprise me if she did.
Well that was scary. I'm Steve from Freeport, Michigan. Whew, close one.
Her acting is too good.
We are going somewhere else.
Yes, it's true....  Twitter is (was) snowflake city.... Now they'll need to get real jobs, if they can find any during the recession... Maybe they can find work (er, I mean gainful employment) digging ditches for the city...  What a paradigm shift...
The Bee is getting very good at what they do.
thumbs down for the speaker blowing bass at the intro. go fuck yourself
Love the ending, haha.
Mandy was murdered
Useless person is someone that takes a successful business to bankruptcy
Office Space reference. LMAO!
The Walking Twits. F*kin' 'avocado on toast'
using that 4 letter word, WORK. sinful.
Guess we know why musk bought it
Now they are going to be living the real world.
Ex-Twit: “You mean if I don’t like someone’s political views, I can’t doxx them and get them fired? Is this true for for other jobs too?”
When he said, "What would you say you did there?", I had a flashback to Ron Livingston being interviewed by management in the movie, Office Space 😂😂
Was this supposed to be funny?
Way to GO --bravo BABYLON BEE.
Boring
We're all celebrating them getting fired but the truth is these people will NEVER work a real job. Do you not understand that they have Twitter on their resume now? Some other commie big tech company has probably already hired them and given them another 6 figure job where they do nothing but suck money from the company. Not only that, but how many of them are trust fund brats? Most of them went to expensive Cali universities. Very few of these people will ever experience the consequences of their infantile behavior.
🤔Was that satire or reality, because I've seen millennials do just that?
I can see them walking in with their list of demands to be hired
I'd say great acting. But after seeing the way she behaves on twitter. I feel like this is the least fake thing Morgan has ever done.
🤣
Typical woketard  leftie  chick. I'm surprised her hair wasnt all koolaided up.
X twatter employees better warm up to the idea of getting cornholed ;  BYOvasoline.
All  they're good for is scrubbing dumpsters and shining  porta- potties. Nothing that would endanger humans.
Hey, is that the same office from the other video with a different set design? I still love you guys.
Love to watch snowflakes melt, even if they are acting
Need a series on this video hahah
Go Woke, get another job,,,SOMEWHERE ELSE, LOL
Nahhh this is SO true
Boss - "You're 20 minutes late for your interview..." Former Twitter employee - "Yeaaaah, welll...  you knoooow..." Boss - "I see... Let me save you and me the time then... Yeah, well, you know... Byeeeee!"
Watching people loosing their jobs with the holidays coming is sad. I have empathy for them well just a little.
🤣🤣
Rooftop cornhole sesh... hell ya. With mimosas!
Brilliant, twits to actually fined a company that wants them and puts them to WORK
Can’t imagine this is on YouTube….as they can’t even handle a 👍
I feel like having Twitter on your resume might make it tough to find a job
Granted this is just a skit but speaks volumes of how dumb this current generation actually is! Despicable!
She got the same eyes as anna Kendrick
"Cornhole Session?" I won't even hazzard a speculative guess!
I was disappointed at the end that you did not play it as "blackhand" racism :P
I love this lady put her in more please
😂 that’s hilarious. Hey, at least she’s hot though. Once life beats her up a bit she might be good for a barefoot and pregnant wife or something… but I don’t know anyone who wants to stick it in crazy.
They should "learn to mine..."
🤯
Office Space moment was on point.
Lmao 😂 I needed to laugh 😂
She's going on OnlyFans.
One joke and only one joke  One day conservatives will good at satire I have faith in you
Cage free shrimp😂😆
Excellent cast and genius comedic writing!
This is Gen Z and they just had the biggest impact on any election in history. If you still have your kids in public school, reconsider.  If you are thinking of a 4 year college with long term student loans discuss with your child long term plans and not only why they want to go to college but what they expect from college.  And just saying long term employment is not enough.  The government is making a generation of working slaves to entrap young people.  Consider other options available, like apprenticeships, internships, travel with a learning plan, work study abroad and self employment.

!!I JUST SAID THIS TODAY!?!  *like you have NO Training Temperamental Dumb AND you don't Read....[now ENOUGH about your POLITICAL Affiliation. Let's U.S. get to YOUR Real Character.....]
"Its like I literally can't"
NICE! loved it!!!
I love the Office Space reference!
2:47 I'm surprised he wasn't accused of doing Black Hand LOL
The humanity! How dare you!!
I worked there as a contractor for a while. This is not parody.
Love the Office Space reference.
It's hilarious to think of their wake up call but there are legit concerns about how people in many jobs are over worked. This will give the employers more of an excuse to treat people like cogs in a machine. We will go screaming back to the other extreme, this time with digital chains. Oh goody
Elon musk really has a colossal problem at restructuring and rehiring at twitter, i'm glad i'm not involved.
I bet she put this "job" interview in her resume.
😁😂
The shoutout to Fruitport, MI is so random lol I live near there
Remember, young people are the future of our country.
Wtf is this world coming to.
"What would you say, you do here?"
Best perk of any job is my current job where my employer, in 40 years of business, has never done layoffs. The perk is knowing, as long as I do my job, it's waiting for me every day. I <3 job security.
I started to laugh but i slowly realized that this is true
This is no goddamned joke.  This is the worthless "work force" now.  The youth of today are going to sink this nation.  They are WORTHLESS!  Not only are they worthless but they are like dragging along a boat anchor.  They're expensive, costly little pieces of shit that don't come near to pulling their weight.  I blame the psychiatric community for pedaling an agenda that creates thumb-sucking babies who cannot handle the world.
This being the Bee, I can only assume that "corn hole session" has a variety of meanings.
Lmao
I know it's not likely, but I would love to see one of these people applying for the demolition union or a temp agency for physical labor.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:06 "what would you say, ya did there". Office Space Vibe.......
What qualified her so far that she got invited? Could she dance her name or is it just the fact she doesn't have a gag reflex?
The scary fact is that this is probably true for most of the former employees at Twitter. Most of them will probably go on unemployment and eventually will be homeless
Wow that ending made the whole thing brilliant lol
That’s so bizarre The Babylon Bee should do a parody.
Because he … does stuff
Most young people today can't or don't want to do real labor work ,they just want to be behind a computer equipment devices telling people your getting band , or you owe us a payment for this or that ,or like cellphones get cut off because of usage of mega bites and giga bites and demand more money, that's there easy way of making money meanwhile the real hard working Americans panic in sweat and tears .
This was amazing, as usual!
Twits from Twitter!
A whole generation ruined.
Genuine entertainment!
100% authentic portrayal of a woke, nutjob, liberal.
I'm starting to think she was a real  twitter employer undercover in babylon
I was not expecting that end. 😂🤣
It’s not just the tech world, these same types of millennials in Ottawa during the trucker convoy. Working a cushy job from home, never missed a paycheque, great health benefits, and not much work to do so lots of time to be insufferable on Twitter.   A great way to deepen the already insane class divide is to overpay self-important progressives and remove them from any contact with working class people. I mean, the laptop class did sometimes have to interact with food/grocery delivery people but that’s the extent of it.
😂
Why aren't you hiring self cleaning people?
😂😂😂
I need my lawn mowed.
I actually believe this is better than the actual truth.
Somehow, this was more annoying than funny.
Twitter sounds like a scam if they didn't do anything there...
I just worse the ass out of my pants thanks to dragging it accross rooftops, but I do feel bad for this lady 😪
3:07 "he might have covid, let's fuck up the entire world about it"
Ha ha, Office Space line
I have a question to anyone that might now the answer.  Is all that crap she is saying even a bit true? I would find that disturbing if true.
LMAO
they wouldn't have AA at Twitter because AA teaches about God and religion and we all know that old Twitter employees are hyper liberal godless pos.
So true!
The real tragedy of Elon purchasing Twitter is that now all these adult daycare inhabitants are coming to your workplace in hopes that your boss will pay them to sit around and do nothing while you’re forced to pick up their slack. Gatekeep the heck outta your jobsites, folks! 😏
😂😂😂
She must be one of the more moderate ones...she actually used "Mister" while addressing the boss!!!
Yeah, that's why Twitter immediately tried to get a bunch of them back because the company couldn't function without them.  Almost like firing people en masse based off how many lines of code they'd written was a bad idea.
BAN THAT GINGER!   BAM! NO SOUL BAN!
My neighbour was telling me his 19 year old son got the ultimate compliment at work when his boss told him “you’re doing great, you have a work ethnic not of your generation.”     Sadly, I guess we’ve reached a point when working hard without complaint is seen as some unicorn in a meadow.
1:05... I really appreciate the tip of the hat quote  from the movie "Office Space"
Lmao. What would you say you did there amazing
This is how I imagine a twitter employee being 🤣🤣🤣
Okay guys, the acting needs a little work 😂 🤦🏻‍♂️
This cunt haha, it's sad that it's somehow realistic
I expect that’s about right well at least their parents will have use for their basements
...next step, world War 3 breaks out...they all get drafted...
It's funny how i can see some of the 'contained' triggered responses in the comments so they don't look too too obvious.
Well, in reality, the interview would have ended in like 5 seconds. 😅
🤣
This was a real horror film 😂😂
That is not just ex-Twitter employees. I work as  PM in IT and we had one technician quit the first day because he did not like the temperature of the office. Another quit on week two after experiencing a "panic attack" when he was told to cross train with a group across the hall.
Honestly, the whole "What?  Actually work?" reminded me of plenty of non twitter employees :p
lol I just had some guy quit our 3rd shift warehouse job because loading trucks is hard... These people are lame.
hand work, like an HJ right! she probably gave plenty of those!
Really? The 1906? Why?!
Oh no! At the end! They're becoming "progressive"....NOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Just for the grease, BB should banned!
The funny part is that this is going to happen lol. The pampered lazy people have zero clue what a real.job is like
Funny enough, I was with my friend (interviewer) they had an applicant who "worked" at a company and "left at their own free will" with no actual skills and bantered almost like this broad while a stuffed myself laughing, my good pal had also tried to hold his own. 😂
She looks like Lena Paul’s sister 🙊
3:02 "We've"...he should have ridiculed her for that. And then calling her "miss" should have set her off for him assuming gender.
When real life is this hilarious, it’s a sign.
I liked the cornhole callback. However, I have to ask... do people in Silicon Valley play cornhole? It's usually the staple of Moose Lodges and picnics out here. It may just be, uh... my cultural bias to assume it's a more humble past time.
😆 🤣 😂
I’m surprised she wasn’t wearing a mask.
Gen Z SnowFlakes Don't Deserve a Job At All, they only deserve to be left Where they started. At Home on the verge of being kicked to the curb by their parents.
Sadly, I've had people almost that bad come in to apply as a machinist at my shop. One guy was actually shocked to learn we had a minimum 50 lbs lift requirement.
“We are not allowed to say that” 🤣🤣
I worked with someone like this at my old woke workplace … this is not too far from the truth 😂… “oppressive white colonial management” I’ve heard that before … nice job! (Btw, I quite that job).
Can I arrive at around 11:30  Ish am?
She's got the right work attitude 💀
How did she not call them out for wearing "black hand"?
OMFG!!! ROFLMMFAO!!!
It's no fun being unemployed..that being said hahahhahahaagagag
This pretty much sums up the incoming workforce in general.
Nothing epitomizes this than FTX guys, especially that Alameda Research CEO. Hey BB guys, may be you can hire her and SFB for next sketch as they may be looking for job :) . Of course only if folks upstairs dont pull Epstein on him :)
Imagine being woke and coming to Asia. You won't last very long. You either have to get in terms with reality or die starving and homeless. Shout out to the actress! The world knows that wokies are now an ugly, weak stereotype everyone laughs at and she got it down pretty good 👉🤠👉
These skits are just getting better and better! 🤔 But I guess the ideas are super easy with all the left-wingnut materials that's out there. Tons of free ammo out there to just pick up and use. 😬
wow sooo true
so true
Fruitport, Michigan.  LOL!
Tynnyfer
We need a whole movie like this. Bee please!!!
🤣😅😅
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
awesome! Thanks!
Why is no one mentioning the super slick Office Space reference?... The Bobs!
Hilarious.....gen-x......priceless.......
Spoken like a person who doesn’t work in tech. I don’t know where they’re getting their info, but this, although funny, is complete bullshit.
HA!!
Who in their right mind would hire ex-Twitter employees?
...pretty much sums it up.....
These people need a reality slap.
I thought they were gonna mistake Grease for attempted black face
This is funny lol. But the people posting the most are just mad that Twitter people were making 200-800k a year and can either chill for months or make double at another place 😂 while they will never come close
It would have been interesting at the end, the guru shows up beside the person with glasses and said he was joining both guys for the rooftop cornhole session.
Wait, did he assume her gender at the end?
I WAS 18 JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, TAKING CARE OF MY MOM THAT HAD ALZHEIMERS. I RAN A DIE CASTING MACHINE AT ART SPECIALTY CO. IN CHICAGO. I MESSED UP WITH THAT JOB, YOUNG STUPID I GOT AWAY WITH MURDER ON THAT JOB. I PLAYED WAY TOO MUCH ON THAT JOB I MESSED WITH EVERY ONE. PRACTICAL JOKER TYPE. EVEN THE SHOP FOREMAN'S WEREN'T OFF LIMITS. ONCE THE SHOP FOREMAN WAS SETTING UP A PUNCH PRESS TO TRIM THE PARTS OUT OF MY MACHINE. I COULD IMPERSONATE A CAT REALLY WELL THEN. FOR AN HOUR I HAD HIM LOOKING FOR A CAT , THEN HE LOOKS AT ME WALKS UP AND ASK'S IF I SAW A CAT AROUND THE SHOP . I BUSTED OUT LAUGHING . HE WALKED AWAY MUMBLING PROFANITIES IN ITALIAN AT ME.
...maybe, just maybe, they are not THIS Obvious but you nailed it !
What's on his hands? Oil, refined from only the finest of whales
Hard to tell if it is satire or real life.
Dude did a great job!…girl too.
Self employed private citizen is the best
that sort of person isn't exclusive to twitter employees. i work at a production facility that is trying to expand - they've hired close to 200 people in the past few months and maybe 10 are still there. you have to be able to show up on time, read a tape measure and a level, and lift 15 to 20 pounds. those requirements are far beyond least half of the people that get hired
Light overrepresented. Those guys did nice job with the Twitter. Lay off some of this critique guys.
I never realized "job" and "work" were trigger words or that actually having to keep a schedule and do something to earn money was oppressive, but now I know and can tell my boss. I'm sure it'll be fine.....
Fuck yes
Q: So what did you do on your prior job?.  A: Well actually I was a fact checker & determine what was truth from fiction.
Let's counter the cancel culture by mocking people who lost their jobs, nice idea.
Twitter employees do love a good cornhole session
NAILED IT!
hahahahaha
sad how accurate that probably is.
Do one from the Mom’s point of view, having to get the basement cleaned for their children to live in when they move back home. 😢😢
The very end got me.
So the woke look for work , great job Elon.
This is it. I don’t even know what to say. In the last month, this exact scenario has played out in the minds of 3/4 of the country. Delightful.
I actually work with her sister. Well, I work and her sister talks on the phone and hides in the warehouse and is a magician, she disappears when an order comes in.
cornhole sesh lol
All the bitter non skilled workers .ad at programmers for having good jobs.   Ooof.
This was funny, but it's not comedy. It's how these people roll.
Hey Babylon Bee.    Just out of curiosity,  how many former Twitter emloyees do YOU plan to hire on to do some:   Work.  Labor.  Production.    STUFF ??
That ending was classic!!!
Cage free shrimp lmao !
I do feel for her, as I don't enjoy having to "work work", either...
Ex Twitter employees can still learn how to code and get a job at Meta. I've heard that they are hiring
LMAO... the woke will go broke!
Love the Office Space refs, nice job.
Office Space vibes..
The reaction to greasy hands got me 🤣     so true 👍
Just know that there is a subreddit called anti-work and this fits in perfectly
How do these people survive?  Notice that the very first thing the man did was begin accommodating her demands.
Holy shit, is that... Morgan? I think her name is? Man, that's a blast from the past.  one of her best friends from high school is my ex. I remember when they did a video together and it went viral.
H0W B0UT 60+ HR WEEKS , GET H0ME T0 MAKE SURE H0MEW0RK IS D0NE , FIX DINNER , BATHE , SIEEP AND REPEAT ????   THESE JEII0-HEADS HAVEN'T A CIUE 0F WHAT REAI IiFE IS !!!  SAD FUTURE GENERATI0N ,, AND I'M INCIUDING THIS SITE AND AII MSM  , CAUSE THEY AII D0 IT
So notorious Twitter turned out to be nothing but adult daycare.
This brings back so many memories.  I was working in a factory and no screens were ready in the screen-printing room.  So I spent the whole first 4 hours rinsing out screens.  When I took a midday break, my hair and clothes had a little water on them, I was sweating a little bit, and my hair was a little out of place.  People stared at me like I was from outer space.  They said, "WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!?!"  I said I've been working, we're in a factory you know.  They had never heard of getting dirty in a factory.  Then a few weeks later, a girl broke her nail while working.  I thought we were going to have to call an ambulance.
Someone please tell me, was this really anything remotely close to what was going at twitter and similar companies??? Because if it is, what’s gonna happen to these people in the real labor world? You know where you actually produce something or offer an actual service?
This is what China wants and normalizing on Tiktok in the US. Failure and complaining about everything, and brainwashed to thinking you're doing good. As long as I'm not apart of any of it. China may never destroy the 38 states.
How did you find a real former Twiiter employee to do this?
I loved the end line, like if she was rejecting the company and not the other way round.
The video and the comments are hilarious…
Elon isn’t fixing any of the free speech problems.
That twist at the end was hilarious!
Freeport Michigan, population 450 maybe, probably less lol Go Steve!!
"what is it you would say … you did there?"  XD
This was actually a documentary.
I just love the way I wanted to slap the shit out of that bitch
Stone Mountain Park and they did a lot for there inployees
I'm just patiently waiting for the moment the masses realize that an mRNA injection literally means they become GMOs.
lol! what a riot!
It really is that bad & the left has created these USELESS people
LOL that's one of the funniest videos I've seen all day you guys are killing it
Yup
😆😆😆😆😆😆
I thought the Bee was satire?
For ex-Twitter employees, the company I work for has a software dev position available. But, it's on-site at a factory in rural-ish Alabama and there will definitely be people with dirty hands there.
That manager couldve been a bit more firm and unyielding  And why did he let the interview go on so long?
Hey honey . . . I need a good bongo cleaning!
so tech work isn't real work? and what you're doing is? yeah, i guess somebodies gotta blow nazis.
It’s funnier because this episode was clearly based on the TikTok video made by a new twitter employee which wouldn’t surprise me if she is now unemployed.
☠️1️⃣🌎🏛
back to moms basement
Twitter has $5 billion in revenue.  BB?
*colleges make infants, its true*
She plays that part so well. That girl is a natural.
This is waaay too accurate.
@1:05 I see what you did there. Nice subtle shout out.
These people were paid to do nothing period.
Wow, he gave her three minutes of his time.  Actually let her talk herself out of it.  I was ready for her to go as soon as she spoke.
Hey ex-Twitter employees, learn to mine!
💯💯
I hope all former Twitter employees quietly get CANCELLED.
Starbucks,Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s should have a new worker pool for the next decade
I’ll tell you what. Morgan is a wizard.
Corn holeing on the job??? Good lord I used to have to go to certain bars for a good session of corn hole. Changing times.
So Mandy your the one who Banned Steve
Being only 20 mins late ruined the satire at the start because to close to being on time for a twatter lol.  Should have made her turn up with a pillow and sleeping bag being that early.
"labor, stuff done" hahaha pronouns 😝
But with all due respect, she's beautiful, so who cares if she does anything?  I'd certainly hire her! 😀
No real job is going to be that patient with a person like that, they will be like, this is the truth, this is what we need, and we don't take people that are late for interviews, and they won't say sorry either
Just omit your last job from your resume, even McDonalds has some standards!!
Boy oh boy won't they be surprised 😯 when they get in this big bad real 🌎.
All jokes aside, that girl is cute af. Holler!
Welcome to the real working world !
They shouldve made this about retraining them to be useful in society by learning to Frack for natural gas or mine cold
I heard that all the females laid off at twitter weren't addressed as Ms. Mrs or Miss. It was short and simple and said, Bye Felicia.
roof top what now?    Come on Bab Bee  you know Damn well We prefer draft beer or scotch!  OJ n sparkling wine is for  Zima drinking libtards 😉 Or Sunday brunch with the in-laws.😔
Appreciate this, Babs. Funny stuff and probably true. 😂
wow
I can't believe how bad he/him oppressed she/her. And now she/her can't even cancel he/him anymore
Imagine that having to actually work for a living and buy your own breakfast lunch and dinner. I can only imagine how far south that interview went when all the woke cancel culture BS came spewing out of the millennial's mouth. I'd say she's going to be unemployed for a long long time.
Because working at Babylon Bee is real physical labor.
imagine her playing one of these freaks on a first date
Reality is such a shock to that demographic. To the rest of us, it's just ...reality.
"What would ya say, you DOO here?"  - CLASSIC.
Nice subtle reference to office space!
Way too funny, but there is a lot truth behind the humor. Keep up the good work. :)
This has Hindu hatred elements
you know this is true!:) LOL!
Good luck 🤞 🍯 honey
Pfft. I'll bet she wasn't even given a participation trophy for submitting her resume 😒 That guy is LITERALLY Hitler!
Almost too painfully real to be funny.
The young crop of rookies has been doing outstanding comedy. You should pay them or buy them some gum they can share.
Most twitter employees couldn't  handle a real..shhhhh job
🤣
These people are in for a rude awakening.
BB, why are you holding back?
Best video ever..!
Libs loved SNL making fun of Trump during his presidency, but this is so much better and relevant.
Nice Office Space reference... "what would you say... you did there?"
This isn't a joke. Last week. I overheard a interview. The employee said I quote. I have to be off by 3pm every day for my mental health. And I can't work Thursdays becuase I go paddle boarding for my physical health. I can start tomorrow but need next week off. I have concert tickets.  No exaggeration. I stayed to ask the manager wtf. She said. That was totally normal now. All kids say and demand that kind of stuff. Mind blown.
That was OUTSTANDING!
Nailed it
Sad thing is, this is not an exaggeration.
1:08 haha, the office space reference.
I bet she was straight out of Berkeley and Twitter was her first "job".
I thought with the greasy hands she would accuse him of cultural appropriation or a kind of black face (but for hands)
I swear if I don't have my meditation rooms than you might as well forgot me ever doing a "job-job."
Imagine putting Twitter on your resume? You would NEVER get another job again in your life!
I love how the guy went all "The Bobs" on her.
So fun!!! Now do Facebook!!! And then...
Watching Twitter Girls Struggle reminds me of Every American Generation and Their Contributions:   The American Patriot = Overthrowing Tyranny...Founding "One  Nation under God" The American Businessman = Industrializing America...Building a Nations Infrastructure The American Liberator = Fighting 2 World Wars....Securing an American Century The American Innovator = Inventing a 4th Plane....Creating a New Information Age and Exploring a Space Age and now with twitter girl... The American Dumbass = Demanding something for nothing....Fostering an demented state of mind...
THAT WASN'T GREASE....IT WAS BLACK HAND....YOU PEOPLE DISGUST ME...
Wait, was that a black hand? Surprised they didn't catch on that.
Time to Learn to Code?
Somewhere in the plastic hills of silicon valley, there is a zey/zem/bing/bop/hippity/hop/till/you/drop liberal unironically hyperventilating into their non-binary short-haired terriers' plant-based dog treat mini tote bag whilst watching this video.
When I was speaker of the house I had the perk of insider trading, I made like 250 million off of dumb taxpayers.
Sad thing is this isn't just twitter workers mentality lol ex. Streamers +
Funny, she would make a perfect Spanish (Spaniard, southwest Europe) woke politician.
The sad part is she'll still find some simp out there who will pay for her to sit at home and make TikTok videos.
🤣🤣🤣
VERY FUNNY AND SO TRUE IT SCARES ME VERY MUCH. GLAD I AM OLD
I wish I was in an area with a twitter building.  I am looking for one hire in IT.  And I need the laughs of interviews with former twits.  Sorry, tweeps.
Funny
Working for twitter is a real job
Gotta say I like Elon more every single day.
welcome to the real world
You missed the part where he used the term Miss to reply, 'did you just assume my pronouns'.
Deciding whether I wanted air conditioning or automatic transmission in my work truck... oh wait.
BYOG🤣🤣🤣
you could make the interview process faster by prominently displaying either a Trump 2024 banner or MJT's 'there are only 2 sexes' sign
This was funny!
I know this is parody, but this is what I imagine when I think of those turds looking for employment.
Right on target, I've met so many people like this.
Make some more room on skid row, they, them gonna starve!
No way a blue collar worker like that would sit through any of that.
I have a degree in CSc, a masters in business administration, 12 years experience programming, 10 years in project management, and no tech firms would even call me back for an interview.  Note I have a male Anglo Saxon name.
This is highly accurate display of ex-Twitter woke employees.
The bee should try doing some satire sometimes
"What would you say you did there?" Nice office space reference intentional or not 🤣
🤣🤣 A surprise ending!
Spot on
How does BB put of better filmed products than hollyweird?
Soon she will just shack up with some rich guy and continue her complaints.
Working for McDonalds ain't bad
Ending sucked.
McDonalds?
This might be funny if it wasn't, you know, true.
Get a real job
No interviewer worth their salt would bother with a 20 min late candidate. Hell, I've laughed in peoples faces when they were surprised I wouldn't interview them for being 1 minute late. I've also shut interviews down in well under 5 min. My record was in the hallway on the way to the interview room. A candidate handed me a list of his required working conditions. I stopped, glanced at it briefly, then turned around walked him back to the front door.   Clueless participation trophy baby "What about the interview?" Me "We will give you a call when a position that meets your criteria comes up."  Zero point wasting a second of time on adult children incapable of grasping the purpose of an interview.
How to the keep topping themselves. I love this skit.
Jesus Christ what does she expect the Victoria Cross 🤦🏻‍♂️ Pathetic
Great video, but special nod for the Office Space reference. ;-)
LOL nice reference to the Bobs from Office Space. Also I don't think Twitter would have Alcoholic Anonymous, isn't it kind of a religious orientated, or at least heavily promoted?
The ethereal world of youth and a job. Just so funny. Cheers Babylon Bee.
Spot on.
LMAO. Perfect.
Better than any SNL skid!!
Don’t forget: she will be impossible to contact after 5 pm because she needs to focus on her work life balance.
Ermagerd! That, was like, SO triggering!
Making fun of the woke, mentally challenged left is cruel. Fun, but cruel.
Surprise- most highly paid jobs are exactly like this. Some don’t come with perks such as those at Twitter but involve very little day to day. You get fired though if you are tested and don’t come through when it matters.
fetishizing working hard to make a stupid billionaire rich when he fucks up a stock purchase over asking price
Nailed it. Lazy do nothing liberals
Good work 👍
“Work” is Truly a nightmare for ex-twitter employees
Missed the chance to accuse the guy for black palm.
Nobody cared when they shut down the pipeline and layoff people who actually worked, why the fuss over techies losing their positions (I can’t call them jobs)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Learn To Code
Privileged problems
I loved the way she gagged when she saw dirty hands. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You guys are loving ripping into Twitter. I wonder why?
Yep well they all make 6 figures living in ultra expensive areas. Instead of slaving for dumb asshole for barely enough to survive.
😂 I hope they see this
Twitter employees were basically paid keyboard warriors.
My mind read too much into the corn hole sesh talk 😏😔
:)
Never received many perks until I was transferred overseas and myself and coworkers got extra ammo and rations.  Oh the air support was a real good perk also.
Don't forget the "Safely Meeting"
Not entirely realistic.  First, her last name would be hyphenated, Zanderton-Goldmann.  Second, she'd be wearing some sort of pride affirming shirt to show how much she supports a group that she never talks to or hangs out with in any area of her life.  Third, she'd have a 27 dollar grande apple crisp oatmeal cappuccino veranda macchiato mocha from Starbucks.
In comparison of this, government looks highly productive!
Welcome to the real world.
This is pretty dah dum dumb!
The “Bob’s” impression was spot on.
I hope they find a job with a lot of safe space.😜
Corn hole...the B is ROCKING the joint 😋 👌
Intent was funny but execution was too cheezy
Good stuff!
She missed out on the mimosas .lol.
Can’t believe she didn’t ask for her severance package
... you guys only do mimosas?  In the boat mechanic world we do mint julips and burbon and tea
Good one!!
"So, what did you do before this job?"  "I worked at Twitter!"  "Ah, I see you're a cancer cell of media..."
Nope right on out of here little they/them.
I didn't see any green dreads or visible neck tattoos!.
😆 🤣 😂 True Story 👍  😆
Hilarious
There are a lot of former Twitter Twits that are currentley having or are going to have a MENTAL MELTDOWN when they REALIZE that they will have to get a REAL JOB! LET'S GO BRANDON!!! FOXTROT JULIET BRAVO!!!
This is funny, but our enemies have done this to the nation. Who is going to protect children from Gen Z in 25 years when the sane generations die off?
There are coworkers of mine who take home at best $30,000 a year and they are defending these people who Elon Musk fired.  “But the poor family’s!” they tell me.  Even after I explain these people did no real work making six figures and are still getting full pay and benefits for two months after being fired, my coworkers still “feel” it’s not right.
Good stuff
Could you imagine actually interviewing one of these lawsuits waiting to happen?
Future Human Resources employee right there!
Y'know, this makes me want to work at Twitter now, imagine getting paid while occasionally clicking a button on your phone.
Best part was 1:04 "well, what would ya say.....ya did there?" So Office Space lmao!
I’m dead laughing
I want to think this is exaggerated because these people are kids. If they lost the opportunity to learn life skills like responsibility and discipline, the future is doomed.
This isn't even satire, I have seen a few videos of how these tech people "work" its insane.  From the food that is served to them, to the game rooms, silent relax rooms, lounge rooms, it goes on.
This is probably pretty accurate... love seeing a stress out millennial who hasn't done anything yet.
These are the real academy award winners
Well, if I was her I don't think I'd be putting Twitter on my resume!!!
"what would you say, ya did there"
Roof top corn hole session? What the heck is that supposed to be?
Cool.
I honestly thought she was going to accuse him of doing black hand
🤣🤣🤣 Hell with the ending! "I got the mimosa's" 🤣🤣🤣
Putting that 200k feminist gender studies degree to work there.
The scary thing is- this is supposed to be satire, but it's closer to truth than fiction.
That’s not just ex twits!  I saw this from many college grads across the aerospace industry.  If it’s not done on a laptop or phone, they won’t do the work.  Hire from a trade school for higher productivity and better problem solving.
Loved the ending!
So true....sad
ha after she bailed, perfection.
So now you know how it feels to be shut out. No big deal, Republicans WILL handle what you are afraid to do, which is nothing.
Love this one too!
They won't get jobs, they are unemployable.
I thought you guys did satire? The only satire in this was the ending!
*_I thought for sure that it was the man's wedding band that freaked her out at first._*
McDonalds is waiting...
Wow what a joker! Attitude bouncing all over the place 😂
Is this satire or a documentary?  I can’t tell anymore.
It was okay. It was a little anticlimactic. I think TBB could've done better.
100% accuracy 👌 😂
imlying the babylon bee staff ''work''
It's sad that you do got some kind of useless people who are you being laid off from Twitter but there's so many wolf crap companies that they'll probably go right back to doing nothing and making a $100k. Really they're about as useful as homeless people and probably should be homeless and instead of giving them money people should shit in their face
So this was the one who banned Babylon Bee? Nice touche.
The quality of this hidden camera video is impeccable
What a bunch of 🐎 👈🏽 those people must have been.
"What was on his hand!?"  i thought she was having a negative workplace reaction to his wedding band.😆
if it wasnt for the factory workers , we dont have products right now ..spread the love❤ this is great guys!
This isn't exaggerated though. People that work in office environments are extremely lazy. Not saying that everyone is lazy and also I am not trying to sound sexist but every every field I have worked in including my job now as an inspector doing system turn over for the refineries. Woman have ruined the industrial workforce. They'll get thrown into an office position because they're useless in the field and they'll fk off all day doing minimal work. While you have guys competing to go up the chain of command with their hard labor. We have units and plants to build. We need to get stuff done. Guys are just competitive and they want to grow. They know they won't get the meal ticket handed to them. Even my boss which is our corporate quality control manager said she will never hire a woman in our department for the simple fact they are a liability and they will not produce no where near the same amount of work the guys are willing to do that includes staying late, coming in early, pull a 16hr shift, go to sleep for 4 hrs and come back to work for another 12hrs, or coming in randomly at night or on the weekend to get stuff done. Woman simply won't do any of that. They don't have the drive or desire to commit to their career.
McDonald’s is hiring 😂😂😂
Twitter loosing 4 million a day 🤣
I thought this was supposed to be a parody....
Fucking subscribed for this video
Twitter SJWs disliked this video.
Snickers 😅
What the hell is a 'corn-hole sess?  I am old, but really?  Corn-hole sess?  Another great video from Babylon Bee.  Thank you.
Poor girl, what a shock. First interview, cameras everywhere. I'd sue
"WHAT?  No "Safe Space" rooms?  No charging ports for my Tesla?  No vegan options at the greasy spoon across the street?  What kind of hell is this?!"
hear trades people are giving up lunch breaks and expected to work 10 hour days , no wonder half the employees at twitter got fired they dont do any thing.
It would be funny if it wasn’t footage from a real interview 🤣🤣🤣
I love how he said "Whatdya say... ya did there?" like the guy in Office Space during their firings.
Not to worry, useless Twitter ex employees;  tax season is near and they always need people to pass out flyers and hold/twirl signs at major intersections.
Elon musk firing thousands of employees. Tweeting away banning people that make fun of him is a real job?
If this sounds funny and a fantasy think again, this is  reality at tweeter.
I loved the boss!  He was totally believable!  Laughed out loud every time he corrected himself from : " work..labour..stuff.." You guys are so much fun!
"And then back to 'cornhole'". Sounds like a Twitter employee, alright. 🤮
I know it's fake and even if real times are tough and it's hard to find people, but if you seriously give a person like that more than 30 seconds than you're just shooting yourself in the foot.
Seriously, I thought my generation was lazy.  I have been a Longshoreman for over 20 years.  A monkey could do my job.  No way a Gen Z'er could,  but a monkey definitely could!
I've known people who left their college years like this.  "Yes, you're here to work, so stuff can get made, so the company can sell it, so the company can make money, so the company can give you a paycheck, and so the company can keep their lights on to keep giving you a paycheck."
Awesome!
I'm sure that at least 40% of the former Twitter staff will just go homeless and live off of the system.  Kind of like all of the people that would rather be homeless than take entry-level work(which hasn't been helped by Obamacare's 30hr/week cap that STILL exists).
I wish whatever those drinks were at the end were just two miller highlife cans dangling from the 6pk duck killer plastic nets lol
When I hear cornhole session , I think Paul Pelosi staged break in .
This was so good I almost got sick and couldn't finish watching bye lol.
That's funny, but not far from the truth. Former Twitter employees have the most delusional human beings alive.
That is about right they are goona freak out they have to get a real job 😂
The stinger was perfect.
And currently the job market is flooded with tens of thousands of people just like her.
Can you do one with penn giving zelenksy the Oscar for best actor?
😋😂😂
You can lead an idiot to water, but you can't stop them from drowning and this is why every gun law is an infringement
BYOG...🤣🤣🤣🤣
I had an employee break down in tears when I told her she had to limit her ping-pong break and actually do some work. This really isn't that far off.
So the Right begins its shift away from populism and back to corporate shilling.  Crack that whip.  Get to work.
Geez, the vocal fry was quite unbearable 😝
I am imagining some of this is not far off the mark
Problem is these laid off toad stools won't support themselves anymore.  I guess it's back to moms basement or the welfare office.  This is the problem with having propped up all these people with little to no skill or work ethic for so long.  When the rug gets pulled out they have no other options and frankly, thanks to our overly charitable unemployment system, no motivation to even try.
Hahahahahahaha "what would you say you did there?"   She shoulda said..."I'm good with people!"
The bird is free! 💙
Twitter was a mess. With Elon it’s still a mess. He has a debt clock ticking so he needs to find a way to make it profitable and or valuable.
So we're is the joke
Haha 😄,  the truth and what Gen Z is all about.
How do you know Fruitport, MI?
It’s funny video but there were crazy good software professionals.
Hahahahahaha Brilliant.
Best perk ever ... I worked where I met people from all over the world,   found ways to help and learned much.  Among the people, presidents, prime ministers, senators, congressmen, governors,  educators, scientist, even Bill Gates,  Ted Turner, Hanoi Jane, 75 76 Reds .... celebrities  of all sorts, from Janet Reno to Ray Charles but most enjoyable common folk, we often spoke of family and life in general.  Retired and surely miss it .
How about doing one with how Musk is changing twitter and have him, a new employee and an old employee coming back to get rehired since they can't find a job?
Here in Canada corn hole means something much much different.
I feel like you made this with the intention that it be funny. It's not. It's not unfunny because I'm offended by it. It just objectively not funny. Please find another profession.
The days of the worthless wonders are over.... Work to survive, or die.
Makes you wonder what the hell workers really did at Twitter. They did ban me though.
Here's an idea, just rub her with bacon and throw her to the dingos, problem solved. You're welcome.
It's sad but this is closer to the truth than you can imagine.
Hand work stuff.
Fun. Much enjoyed.
Boy would I love to see these twits defend their jobs to the Bobs.    #ICelebrateTheirEntireCatalog
That was funny shit! I'm 72 and the term "corn hole" sure must have a new meaning now from what I remember! Sure disgusted by that type of person.
I got to clean up poop and vomit because house keeping wasn't allowed to mop up body fluids.
She’s definitely a democrat voter
Hopefully she washed her thumbs good .
That's a couple of jobs I've been on...roofer for one. Boss is gone, light the b-----!
That ending 🤣. Now THAT'S how you subvert expectations, Rian Johnson!
Can't wait for the interview!
I’m from Fruitport Michigan… how did they come up with Steve from Fruitport Michigan?! 😂🤣
Possibly one of the truest, most honest descriptions of people I know who work in such endeavors, since I am unfortunate enough to live in California. 😂
Very epic. :)
She should have asked how much was she getting paid for the interview....
So true!
This isn’t an exaggeration… these kids have no idea what work is. Not all.. but many.
Which should be the next company that Elon Musk buys and brings back to reality? XD
Love the Office Space reference lol
too real...not funny at all. My doctor's office is filled with these people and they do not do ANYTHING...I have to CALL and make another appointment for you!?with another DOCTOR? FORGET IT. I DON'T' FEEL SAAAAFE!!
Hahaha just imagine having Twitter on your resume.....good luck finding your next job.....I would laugh seeing your application coming in. 🤣🤣🤣
1:00 🤣 I see what "ya did there" ... That's straight from Office Space! 😆
Love it. God bless The Bee. 🐝
Nice reference to Office Space movie 😂
Lol.  No qr code for the lunch menu.
The Irony is that this was the reality of Twitter , but worse. The priveledged Twit-ters are going to be shocked when they leave their Woke World.
Homeschoolers are going to have tons of job opportunities. My son (almost 13) can't wait to get his hands dirty and start earning money! Like, actually working.
Seize the means of production… go for it. We’re still waiting.
_"rooftop cornhole sesh"_ Can't stop laughing. Clearly I'm a degenerate.
Bahahaha!!!  YOU GUYS ARE ON FIRE!!!! Love these videos!!!!
I have a young Airman in the Air Force that I supervise that acts exactly like this; it's absolutely wild.
Haha
@1:03 love the Office Space influence here
I don't put any stock in a man who is afraid to get dirt on his hands.
This is great. People complaining how hard their barista jobs can be.
Thanks to a REAL Businessman,  sanity has been reinstated at the Twitt, while the twitts are getting the boot.
She is so good 😅👍👍👍
this was awesome
I thought she was going to complaint the hand was wearing blackface.
The genius twitter workers would be surely missed, I'm sure they can provide so much Erm...labour to whatever company is lucky enough to hire them
And so the great twitter purge was done. The evil dictator of Elon Musk banished anyone who looked at him funny to the gulags (peoples own home) in the uptown New York city. Where people had to starve because no lobster with caviar was served. Truly a crime for the ages.  In the gulags the people had to work until they died, cleaning their own bedroom and cook food for the day. Eventually the people were starved to death as no one in the authoritarian fascist state called capitalism cared to investigate the persecution of the people. Only history now will remember the plight of the gender queer underwater feminist dance instructor that never managed to find a job after being fired from Twitter. It is only through the study of history we can learn that Elon Musk truly is worse than Hitler.
I hope Elon knows what he's doing in this space. If not, the BB's got his number...wink wink
Lol rooftop cornhole sesh
Sad but true. Although, I think she would have freaked at being called a "Miss!"
Jack Dorsey is a fkng p*ssy/ moron,  agent for 'the machine'   This is all a big WIN for free speech,  which they hate. 1st Amendment. Fk u, lefties  b-bye
Pretty much a rehash of the old 'hiring a millennium' video.
What the hell is a "cornhole session"? Is it just me or does that sound sexual?
Thought the grease on the hands was a blackface reference.
1:04 - Love the Office Space nod here. 👌 (18/Nov/2022-9:01am🇦🇺EST)
Ok, you may not be aware, but, "Corn hole sesh" is nothing that should be days by anyone in a populated area.
The world is going to eat those Twitter employees alive
Donesinson
Hilarious!  I wonder if any of those employees see any of these videos and can truly laugh at them.  Uh-h ... yeah, probably not.
Yes MJ!
So many clowns posting on here 🤡🤡🤡🤡 Most of the people who lost their jobs shave professional jobs like engineering, data science, etc. They’ll be working in their professions again making good money in another company in no time.
aww.   would have been better if he told her to get lost
“The Babylon Bee,  BOOM, BANNED!” 🤣
I can only imagine how these poor little buggas are going right now in seeking new employment.
This would be hilarious if it wasn't sadly true. These progressive liberal snowflakes are worthless.
I enjoyed watching this skit.
hahahhahhahahhahaahahah!!!
That poor girl. Those men were abusing her using the W word. She did lots of stuff before.
Headnod to Office Space 😂🤣
We should pay Russia to send these Twitter employees to wherever Griner is being held.
That would be hilarious if it wasn't so terrifyingly realistic.
😂😂😂
Learn to weld.
Imagine this type of parasite: 1) printed all the money and gave it to themselves and their mates to get your buying power to zero to take all your stuff 2) fraud-elected themselves into positions of power to decide everything about your life 3) gets protection from your-paid public budget paid police so you can not touch them. 4) you are the carbon to them they are planning to eliminate.
Encountered many young people that mentally can't handle actual work, tried to hire a High school student to pick up branches and rake leaves. didn't know how to use a leaf rake.
Content moderator? BUM
Best perk? How bout a paycheck?!
I believe these snowflakes got everything they deserved getting fired and they might have to really work and pay for their own lunches!! Good going Elon Musk, keep up the good work!!
Our future leaders of the USA. God help us. I worked with GEN Xers at the shop.....they did OK. Very few issues. Millennials and especially GEN Z, either they're cocky and know it all , say shit like " yeah, yeah, yeah pops, I got it" or they sat on their ass most of the day and did as little as possible. Half would move on after 3-6 months. Between the crappy schools/ parents, ya cant totally blame the kids for turning out the way they did.
Your production is amazing. Since the 90s I haven’t seen this quality.
😂🤣😂 It’s going to be just like this for them.
That's about right these days.  Goddammit commies 😆 🤣
Love the nod the Office Space
Retards will be running the country if you don't wake up .
Yep, 100% True !
1:04 Ha! She had a meeting with The Bobs! And he's a dead ringer for Peter Gibbons. 🌈❤️☮️
Ban thel all from work so they ll know ... or give them the heaviest possible
Since Elon Musk fired all those people I imagine the price of a blow job is about to go down.
😂
The Babylon Bee  did not do a comedy skit. This was a hidden video of a real employee interview.
I really don't want to know what is done during a "cornhole session".
Learn to code....   ....no wait that didn't  work out.
She had a brass chip , so she had at least1 year. Don’t leave before the miracle happens.
When she says cornhole, she doesn't mean the game.
I hope she can get her ‘even’ back some day.
😂😂😂😂
#learntoweld
No more adult daycare nor WINE THATS ON THE TAAAAP
Low hanging fruit!!
Two guys, mimosas and corn hole session is that located in the old SF Armory
I see…Engineering is not a real job 🤷‍♀️
I think that people a twitter, worked harder than my ex
so many snowflakes lost
My "better than everyone else" Libtard cousin was one of the casualties in engineering that was fired.  He is seriously pursuing a lawsuit for mental anguish against Musk lmao.  The actress here played that well, no doubt had pointers from my cousin.   P.S.  Made a post on my cousins FB "time to get a real job outside fantasy land" He blocked me... maybe I could sue him for mental anguish too?
It's funny because it's true!
I'd have enjoyed a second Bob during the interview. Thank you for the hommage to a great satyre movie.
It's funny cuz it's true. And sad
WTF is a 'cornhole session'? It sounds rather dubious, possibly involving butter, a variety of corn and several orifices. I'm Aussie, so not so conversant with strange IT types in LA social interactions.
Note to employers: if you see a resume with Twitter as the person’s previous employment, burn that resume. Hire those people at your own risk. And may god help you if you, for some sick death-wish reason, hired that person.
Ironically, these dipshits are pro Marxism, but hate workers and... actual work. Fukin hypocrites.
Learn To Digg 💥⛏️
Shout out to Steve from Fruitport!
Amazing!
I just came across a TV clip from when Elon musk was on big bang theory. He was volunteering at a kitchen during Thanksgiving, but he got demoted to washing dishes because he was too generous with the gravy
The lady nailed this role 😂
😭🤣😂😭🤣😂🤣
Too funny
this is funny and all, but a pretty accurate depiction of the truth with these entitled tards
Can Morgan change her own oil?
B.Y.O.G. "Bring your own Guru". Loved it. 😆
😠💢Your Fired!
I love they mentioned Fruitport Michigan! I played them in high school sports. They always won.
Truth is always funnier than fiction.... and this is hilarious!
My girl currently works at Amazon warehouse and the new employees around 18 years old act like this 😂 they only work 5 hour part time shifts and already tired
Have you seen Market Street? Hand Greese ain't no thang
LOL!!!!!!!! ☺
Almost a trip back in time.  Showing my age here, but the avoidance of actually saying “ work,” reminded me so much of the reaction Maynard G. Krebs would have on the old Dobie Gillis show when Dobie’s dad would say “ work.”
I think they each have a different idea of what cornhole is.
The Woke and BASEMENT dwelling children who need a safe space for merely speaking to them. This was created with participation AWARDS. THERE IS ONLY ONE WINNER. THE REST OF THE HEARTBROKEN LOSERS FAIL TO REALIZE THAT WINNERS WORK HARDER. THAT'S WHY THEY WIN. KEEP CRYING TO MOM AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN HER BASEMENT.
This nation will not survive.
I was banned, too,  after 3 or 4 suspensions.. And I had at least  26 followers!  banned for life.  I guess, hillary,  obama, clapper, brennan, comey, etc,  all couldn't handle posts from a construction worker in the midwest (?)  They are pathetic.. and twitter is pathetic
It just needed her demanding severance at the end....
LOL
This is so fking stupid! Elon paid 44 billion for a toilet. LET THAT SINK IN!
Afternoon Cornhole sesh
Funny thing, I heard there’s a game called “cornhole”, puts a hole new slant on it …but when it’s something you love….
Whatever they actually do at Twitter ain’t got shit on how much fun it must be working at the Bee.
Ngl manual labor scares a lot of people that’s why they become accountants or actuaries or stuff like that. Still productive just not physical. But then there’s some people who don’t expect to do anything, and…..
Probably very close to reality.
I'm in Michigan and Fruitport is pretty cool. Never met Steve though.
You guys make the best videos
This is my third post on YouTube, in ten years, but OH MY LORD i had to say something about that random AA plug got me laughing like a fool
If she’s up for sucking dick I’ll pay her three dollars a day five days a week 😎
The sad part is that this was 100% accurate 🤣.
so good.!
😂😂😂
Great ending.
My betrothed has a "window" of time to show up. She works for the government.
It seems like twitter didn’t fire people when stuff didn’t get done they just hired twenty more useless people
Hahaha!
I want to like this, but the writing is so fkn bad. Republicans fkn blow at comedy.
Worked at a Welding Fabrication Shop for 23 Years. (Masculine) , This Chick would never make through the Door. Our Female Clerical Staff. Spoke like Truck Driving Sailors ...........🤣
I really hope Elon retweets this
How did you come up with Fruitport, MI? Dart thrown at a map of the U.S.? We raised our son in Fruitport. Moved out of that state in 2020 when he graduated and went to trade school out of state himself. Had to get away from the dictator Herr Whitler.
Between this and the couple who moved to Texas, I'm enjoying the hell out of YouTube.
It’s the Bob’s from office space….  What did ya… do there?
Well, in our workplace, we have a lot of recreational facilities. There is a sauna in the heat exchanger room, a aroma therapy room in the washing box (if you forget to turn on the ventilation) mainly providing the intoxicating scent of organic solvents, there is a solarium on the upper floor as long as the sun it shining and of course there are gender-specific meditation rooms. Currently we even upgraded the quality of the paper in them. And for adrenalin seekers, there are several machines that boil cancerous chemicals or rotate huge amounts of steel at crazy speeds right next to your face as you wor... do stuff.
Solid thumbs up just for the Office Space reference 👍🤣
Twitter employees won't apply for manual labor jobs.  They'll apply for other tech jobs.  Sure, Twitter employees are lazy, but they had to have some serious tech skills just to be hired in the first place.
I want a mimosa.
The problem here is that it's hardly even satire. (although hilarious) that place was literally an adult daycare. That also heavily favored one side of the political isle. We all knew it for years. It's glorious watching the meltdown of these people that think twits is the real world! 🤣
Turns out Twiter actualy needed those "woke sjw" emploies, concidering what Twiter turned into after Musk fired them.
At 1:08 I heard a little of the Bob character from "Office Space" HAHA
Who else is feeling like a Mimosa Today??? Although, it may taste different with all those Salty Democrat Tears.. Let's call our new drink "The Salty Felica".
This is painful.  We all know that...XX shouldn't be allowed to vote.
The girl reminds of a hidden boss show where the boss was showing his real family his disguise car. It was a perfectly nice rental sedan and they just laughed and laughed that people actually drove cars like that
Still not your data
I thought she was gonna accuse the guy of doing "black hand"
I caught the Office Space reference.
Elon is doing Thano's work. He is awesome.
Spot on! LOL!
Put dem communist woketards all to hard manual labor in some Alaskan Gulag
The fact that he started adjusting he’s language was triggering
"but this is a job"  lolol
🤣🤣
Those poor poor former Twitter employees. How will they ever survive?  To be honest, DNC affiliates probably snapped them up already. I hope Elon is having his software engineers check for back doors.
This is not funny
😃
While some Twitter employees especially top brass may haf been that way, Elon also fired a lot of good software engineers based on stupid criteria. For example he fired one for correcting him about some technical stuff about Twitter app in India
Meanwhile at the local grocery store, the new sign out front reads: NOW HIRING  *Absolutely Anyone*  Blue hair, double nose rings, whatever you call the dumbbells through the bridge of the nose …. And I live in a small town in Maine.
Surprise ending !!
A content moderation something or other? They must work constantly. Censoring all those people.
lol
So, I'm still for agile work, similarly to how you don't expect a Stationary Engineer or similar titles to do 9-5, some tech titles shouldn't be using that same model.  I'll illustrate: A programmer who is very good at their job will over a few months learn best practices and get their daily/weekly assignments done in 2 hours. Other members of that team will be doing their thing once he/she finishes their part and for the most part except maybe Q/A nothing else needs them to be there.  Not all jobs for programmers are like this, some enterprise jobs use programmers as a kind of IT which IMO they are way out of title for but w/e. An IT guy makes about 45 - 70k a programmer can make 50-200k a year. For the purposes of this I'm only really talking about entry level so 45 and 55k respectively.   I get the jealousy factor but it comes off as other people setting the norms on what should be a decision made on the facts relevant to the employee and employer.   If you have someone who can finish a weeks work in 2-4 hours at 55k rather than 200k. I'd rather that guy than someone who  would take 40 hours to do the same work. My other teams would be ahead of the curve by 36 hours. In that case I'd just expect him/her to be available within working hours for Q/A.  To go back to the blue collar example in the open; Forcing an SE to work 9-5 may work for some places but for others that's a 24 hour position. It's supposed to be always active, so scheduling some one 7 days a week at the exact time is ignoring the demands of the job because the loudest morons out there are sheeping to this 9-5 nonsense.   Finally, I am certain there are folks who just don't work, I'm certain because I saw it all the time when I used to do 9-5. People who pretend to work in their office but are just shuffling papers and talking on their ear piece. Then when reports aren't done they blame someone from another department. I've also seen the opposite during COVID where people who were getting work done were getting more done and were happy af when I did see them at the job site.  I remember one guy actually said he could afford to pay a cab to come to work to avoid 3 hour transit for things he needed to be there for each week. The trip was 15-20 minutes by cab and he would show up to work at like 5am knock out his tasks, when the VP showed up he touched bases with everyone and then left back and was producing his reports from home. He told me the best part was not having to deal with office drama and just focusing on the work.
Brilliant!
Yes, hello I have a gender studies degree and lesbian dance theory and want 250,000.00 dollars and want free wine.
I'd love to see Elon Musk, review the decision to ban with Twitter employees and get them to actually defend their logic.
Whoever made this video... I can't wait until you get laid off and have to go find a 'real job' 😄
Best perk.  I worked for the DOD.  We built fully functional flight simulators of the AH-1 Cobra helicopter.  The team took actual Cobra helicopters and turned them into flight simulators.  They were very realistic.  Full visuals, audio, seat shakers, helmet tracking etc.  The instructor could enter failures and the appropriate circuit breaker would pop and the "software" would introduce the failure.  The system was so realistic I believe they could log flight hours on them.  This was in the 90's and I remember it cost $600/hr for pilots to come use it (the government has different pots/colors of money so they had to pay even though they are also DOD).  Sometimes when the system was set up and they had some down time we'd get seat time.  My claim to fame was that I was the first non-pilot (employee of the organization) to safely auto rotate the helicopter to a landing I survived.
Did he just assume gender? Wait....did I?
Why did I know this was coming 😂 brilliant
I’ve forwarded this to my girlfriend who used to work at Twitter. Her husband is upset she lost her job.
As hilarious as this was, it is exceedingly sad that this is funny 'cos it's true, and is sadly applies not just to twitter freaks, but a whole sorry generation.  Maybe we should just skip trying to save the millenials and simply move on to the next generation?
This was an actual interview, right? Instead of just satire? 🤔
it's great that the taxpayers get to pay for people to not have a jobbo.
It is not good to make fun of the current government work atmosphere
It's funny cause it's true!
Priceless.
This is great! Spot on with today's sick society.
Banned lol
That breast person/possibly woman /lady/she was spot on.     Former Twitter person getting paid for Not Knowing Anything and Never Doing Anything.  Congratulations Elon Musk for firing insane people.
I got a twitter account about 10 years ago.  So far I have sent zero tweets and read zero tweets.  Perhaps someday I will.
:)
“Ohhh, so this is like, a *job* job.” The idea of those words coming out of the mouth of a real person makes me shudder.
Where does Babylon Bee find these actresses 😍😍😍
"Want fries with your cheeseburger, sir?" ~ Former Twitter employees.
so thats why my truck stayed in the shop for 3 months...rooftop cornhole and mimosas
384th, 17 November 2022
you need to zap AOL.  At least 50% of my posts get edited out and I usually can't even guess what the offensive word is.
these are to true
Sweet Office Space reference!!
Was she acting or did they just get a real ex employee to come in, hard to tell.
LOL
“What would you say (a beat) you did there?”  😅 loved “the Bob’s” Office Space reference!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I got the mimosas, classic!😂Funny 😂
Those dogs won't survive as homeless people, and that thought gives me a smile.
Make Liberals Work In McDonalds Again
I worked for a tech startup and before I started they had to get rid of the 'alcohol cart' because people were abusing it lmao
I know this is satire, but this is more or less what I think an Ex Twitter employee looks like.  If I was told to try to depict it, then that lady acted it out perfectly.
Lol!!!! Bee you kill me!
You also assumed her pronouns. lol!!!!! Keep up the great work... OOPS... I mean videos.
Awesome spot on!
Her hair didn't look like it hadn't been washed in a few months and her eyes were bright without meth being the reason - but otherwise very believable 😀
This would be hilarious if it weren't so scarily accurate. Anyone else have any problem with just tossing a generation in to the ocean?
This was funny but true. I worked for the Federal Government for 26 years, and many of the employees acted the same before entitled and woke were a thing. I used to call these people prima-donnas.
When I saw her reaction to the grease covered hands I couldn’t help but laugh. Prier to where I work now my hands got covered with so much stuff (your guess is just as good as mine with what it was) they turned pitch black and after washing my hands (3+ times) there was still traces. Also even before washing I did something that would REALLY gross that person out I ate food (i.e. sandwiches, doughnuts, chips, etc.) with my hands in such a state. Also where I currently work the people on the line would just “destroy” her in less than 1 day since they do a average of 20 units per day and they can’t leave till 20 are made.
"What would you say... ya did there?"   Shades of John C McGinley - Brilliant!     https://youtu.be/O6ozFaZgw9s     go to 00:50
Nailed it!
My boss asked me to work an extra day. I had to explain to her that I just want to get paid but not work
Funniest one this month
I genuinely hope and pray Elon does a reaction video to this
This pile is wheat and the chaff blows away.
Is that funny or something? Genuine question
The funniest thing aboui that is it's not even a funny gig, but could be considered as a documentary.
nice nice
These videos are so hard to watch.  Almost piss myself every time! :/
May try getting a job on the pipeline or a coal power plant cry baby
they always used to talk so much shit about millennials but I think we're doing pretty solid these days.  Hopefully gen z will get their shit together because they're full of mental health problems and are allergic to real work.  maybe its just a kids these days thing and hopefully every generation will grow up eventually even gen z
Bet they will not list they worked at Twitt
Stop making every video "Upcoming" when its not even worth the wait.
Ha ha, loved his "Congratulations" clap. LOL
Probably a graduate of Evergreen College, in Washington State, noted for graduating much in demand gender studies and other useless degrees.
I wonder if having twitter on your resume is now  frown upon and employers avoid these candidates.
Caged shrimps ;)
That was hilarious 😂 😃 😄
I hope they all go homeless and become drug addicted to the point they sell their bodies for a fix just to sleep. So Mote It Be So Mote It Be
little office space reference there - perfectly re-crafted for this sketch - ftw. nicely done.
Shes so good shes actually made me angry
drank like a sailor sounds really derogitory but thats ok for them right lol
OMG so who is going to ban people for wrong thinking on twitter, wont we have a pandemic of wrong thinking.
What was the best perk of any job that you have had?
This keeps getting better every day. The absolute best writing on the planet right now!
Hahahahah
this is why the right loses. lame humor. go hire someone off /pol to make something actually funny.
"So you actually take the specifications to the Engineers?" ... "Well, no, my secretary does that." ... "What would you say you actually DO here?" LOL thanks for the Office Space reference 🙂
Hey, they can always go back to the University where they'll be amongst their flock!
Poor gen-zoners. Shock to the system if they will even take a job. How to pay for their apts & food in 3 months? Sadly, they will get open tech jobs and the best of the last crew let go will have no place to go. The worst will get what's open. Not enough Geek Squad openings. Might have to become substitute school teachers.
Yet more comedy gold!!! Wait till next year!  All these idiots are getting a crash course in reality! "What do you mean I have to pay taxes on my ex 6 figure job? California is so unfair!!!!" Chkl chkl snrt snrt!
Twitter employees aren't worthy of cleaning dogshit off the bottom of my shoes. Change my mind.
The funny thing is software engineers at twitter are going to find phenomenal jobs after this making 2-3x more than any of the writers or actors at Babylon Bee. They don't have to be this salty.
This basically how I picture most Twitter employees already 😅
OUTSTANDING
"What would you say that....ya did there?!" I love that reference! 🤣
I love how optimistic you guys are, thinking these people are actually going to LOOK (requiring effort) for a JOB (requiring any sort of time/energy/labor on their part). These people are all FAR TOO TRAUMATIZED by their firing at the hands of the patriarchal oppressor known as Elon Musk and will likely need years of taxpayer-funded therapy while on unemployment and living in their parents' basements.
yeah digging ditches in some red state shithole is a REAL JOB for REAL MEN.
Get some new actors, this shit is cringe as fuck
Funny, but not really. Sad.
That ending got a chuckle out of me.
a lot of obvious and funny things that could have been done... hopefully already in the works for her next interview.
Maybe it’s just me, but a “cornhole” session sounds very invasive.
They could just learn to code.       Musk isn't firing the ones who code.        Erick Anderson, Raji Ga'ali, and Lin Po Yamota are all still very much employed and their pocket protectors guarantee they will be for a long, long time.
Reminds me of people at my job
omg, this is too funny, these people actually have to work now.
what the hell is a cornhole fest LOL
Elon is a fucking legend!!!
Why would Twitter employees have to apply for another job when Musk was begging them to come back?
I thought Babylon Bee was about parody ?
WORK DUMBER, NOT HARDER!!!
the camera angles ... superb !... hitchcock got nothing on the Bee... ya'll need to make a movie
She may be bratty but she could have my babies 4 sure
Once again, hard to laugh because it's probably simply 100% accurate.
BB got banned from Twitter , Thats all you need to know.  this is racist hate speech.
After this interview, she went home and ranted on Tik Tok about how she almost literally died during that interview, literally the most traumatic experience of her life
This is the second Babylon Bee video I've clicked on and just by the comedic value alone, I'm assuming this is a conservative-leaning channel...
LOL!  Nice!
Pffft, you're exaggerating, this is only like 90% accurate.
That horn in the beginning shows like a Titan warhorn from Warhammer 40k
That's when you lock the door and give her an intervention. Tell them how this world actually operates. Don't let them leave until they understand or have a severe mental break down
I couldn't stop laughing...you guys are amazing!!
never give in to the Woke...it IS called WORK
Damn those Colonialism's's's.
Great stuff
Biden dogs would need a dog walker 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
thought she was going to say that the guy with black grease on his hand was taking part in blackface or something
You should have included her asking how long the work hour is!
It's funny because it's true lol
This is hilarious... but sad at the same time.  Stupid woke work "policies" at these tech companies are breeding apathy and uselessness.
Should have had a guy come out with grease on his face and accuse him of doing black face 😂
Ok I have just had a thought about a reality TV show that would actually be worth watching... Ex-Twitter workers searching for jobs in the real world! Now that would be entertaining!
Sadly not far off. I worked for CA companies that didn't have 1/10th of the 'perks' Twitter had, but offered breakfast. When logical cuts were necessary some employees were b!tching that they weren't getting their breakfast anymore. It was quite the sight to see anyone acting like they were owed anything outside of their agreed paycheck.
Some lib said that Elon Musk should get a real job.   The world has gone completely mad. No one can agree on what the purpose of education is or what a job even is.
I thought she was gonna accuse the dude of "black hand"
Superb. The only people worse than YouTube censors were Facebook and Twitter censors.
Go Elon tell them people that there's a lot of restaurants that need dishwashers out there work is work they'll still get a paycheck self entitled righteous fools maybe you can spread your misinformation that's your new business working for the sanitary department driving the garbage truck.
i see what you did there.... you went all OFFICE SPACE and were like "ok well what is it you would say you do then..."  ahahaha
when is the Bee going to come back to twitter
the boss was way too nice lol
Lol...
I can't believe he treated they like that without offering they a grief counselor afterwards.
Might have been funny if it wasn’t actually all-too-accurate.  Here in Japan my sister-in-law works for a staffing company and the young people come in for interviews that she insists are shockingly similar to this video.    In recent years the fruit picking workers have been harder to find —mostly because young people feel that type of work is beneath them, and the ones that will do it are next to useless — but the apple growers actually announced to Twitter ex-employees that they could put them to work right away. 😂😂  (BTW, my 73 year old mother-in-law’s family are mikan 🍊 growers and every year she heads off to pick mikan because they can never get enough pickers. At her age she picks 3 times what the young people pick because they’re so useless.)
This one is also a keeper. Fantastic job again Babylon Bee. Please keep up the great work because we love it and really, really, really want to see more.
Yep. #StillWaiting @chetmacdonald35. The Professional world is a nice thing, we ain't gotta shoot Old Yeller, see rabies would like totally suck.
Steve from Fruitport, MI! 😆
Twitter is fire now, never used it before but god damn, there's laughs to be had.
We laugh. But she made $350k a year. What a world.
Wonderful. Love it. Hail Mr. Musk. Will he be clearing out any European offices?
Wow what an idiot.
My gosh can you imagine getting a literal  paid vacation everyday and then calling it a job.
Got me with that ending 😂
Shout out to Fruitport Michigan
Anyone else assume she got disgusted at the end because he called her "miss" 🤣
As a carpenter let me help all you pus.... I'm mean ex twitts you say would you like fries with that or welcome to Walmart quite simple morons
China = Happy
There is great money to be made in getting your hands dirty! Really.
I actually expected the thing she was disgusted by to be the guy's wedding ring.
There is a lot of big corporations in this country that are crooked they will find a job very easily
how do elon's balls taste?
I know a few people that think like this.
What's rooftop cornhole sesh
"I've got the mamosas." Said no real worker ever, maybe cans, bottles or even White Claws.
I thought you did satire?
Everyone should have a manual labor job at least once in their lives.  I worked in fast food and at a grocery store in high school and as a janitor in college to scrape together money to eat.  After that everything except cleaning out septic tanks or, literally, working in the sewer is gravy after that.  You need me to jump in that dumpster to get a haz waste sample?  Sure.  You want me to perform inspections in a coal fired power plant?  No problem.  Changing baby diapers?  Easy peazy.
Absolutely killer surprise ending
So not a parody..?
Did he assume her/his/their gender(s+)?
Its even better that Idiotbook has laid off butt loads also.fuk zuckerberg and Rest of the Wokeism world
Good acting, excellent script. Very funny stuff
Why is it that i think this is real?
" ... I've got the mimosas!"  ... well played.
Last few seconds-got ya!!! Ha, ha, ha!
I will see these misfits at the stadium as they throw my peanuts across the stands to me. Oh, wait a minute…delete that! 🫤
Very good. Thanks for the smiles.
Imagine ZEY and ZEM actually finding a job in the real world- LOL
You folks are the best!
"I noticed you have only TWO bathrooms.  Where are the other 87 genders supposed to do drugs?"
I think I just had a run in with a Woke White Beta Male<tm>  Being of supposedly male hormones impersonating a Caucasian man was so wimpy (right down to the limp handshake and asking forgiveness for every and I mean EVERY inconsequential thing) I wanted to run to the nearest meditation room featuring nonstop John Wayne movies for an American Alpha Male fix.  If this and the Karens are what is making up the next American Census it is no wonder the native population is in a steep decline.
LMAO
She banned Babylon Bee!
This is hilarious
Good luck at McDonald's lady
somewhat reminiscent of my favorite movie. "Office Space" as in "What do you do here?"
My God that was an Office Space Easter egg in there beautiful
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I swear I have met real people like this. You seriously just want to smack them.
1:23 Babalon Bee, Banned!
I can’t believe you just assumed that they were a Ms
Man she is hot... Is it wrong for me routing for twitter employees if they all look like her?
Better dirty hands and honest money, the dirty money and clean hands
Facebook is laying a shit ton off too
Now they have to interview LIGMA & JOHNSON, they could be Hard Workers, real Up and Comers....
Is "labor"not a trigger word because it's the word Karl Marx used?
Awesome!!
I could never do the job of banning or moderating on behalf of others. We all have the power to /ignore those who hurt our feelings.
The high ponytail gave it away.
So the gov't sent a woman out to my family's masonry construction company's worksite a couple times.  The first time, during the on-site interview, my dad informs her that she would be expected to do everything the men did. My brother was stocking the scaffolding with 12" splitface block... each weighing about 65lbs. He'd stand between two of them, then swing them onto the scaffolding, one in each hand.  So the woman steps between two block, grabs them... pulls up... nothing happens... she quietly walks off the jobsite.  The next time they sent a woman, my dad pointed to the conga line of laborers waiting to get a wheelbarrow-full of mortar out of the mixers.  She stands in line with her wheelbarrow... When it gets to be her turn, they fill her barrow... she lifts up on the handles, pushes... and she and the barrow-full of mortar spill out all over the ground. Again, she just walks away.  I'm not saying that they gave her these tasks knowing the likely outcome... but I'm confident they knew what the outcome would be.
Hats off to Elon
I don't know. I think they're good for something. Maybe their mothers would know.
Most youngins' would benefit from eight hours a day of hard labor.
Please make this a series.... !
Seems like you played it pretty safe here. I sure hope you show the next interview
Part two: She sues everyone in that office, including the gaggles on the board, for sexual assault......the two guys end up in jail, and the resto of the workers end up in the street because they had to liquidate the factory to pay her indemnity...
Don't forget she probably make at least 150k to do that stuff at Twitter as well. Let that sink in...
Ha, ha, ha!
Congrats on a million subs!
Former Twitter employee looking for work.  Job must have free food and free massage in a supportive environment that encourages me to have a relaxing and enlightening experience at work.
Unfortunately more realistic than many people think….😑
Ahhhh another great content  by Babylon Bee, yes indeed.  Now be quiet peasants while I sip on my $400 tea in a $600 cup  with my pinky in the air.
😂😂
Too many clowns not enough circuses.
The horror... 🤡☣️☯️🎃
This is how long most interviews should last. It should not take long to accept or reject an applicant.
lol these liberals crying over Elon for firing employees like bro it's his company now he can do whatever he wants. employees weren't permanent anyway. they can get a job someplace else
This was super funny. Whoever wrote it is a master. I do have to say though, her acting did not live up to the script 😞
Wow
1:41 I wish she had said "wine on Ta-P!" which I think should be a new meme.
This is disrespectful to Twitter. Elon Musk ruined Twitter!
At first I thought she was going to be disgusted by the fact that he was wearing a wedding ring lol
Twitter had free lunches. Who says there's no such thing as a free lunch. But the free lunches were costing way too much so Elon shut them down.
The acting is so bad. But the script is great
They can learn to code.
Took 3 minutes to get done what should have taken 30 seconds. Boot that uppity biatch.
A coworkers son had a job interview at GOOGLE and the son asked for advice. Dad said just be yourself, so he showed up in jeans and a T shirt. He got the job.
Looks like California is about to get a couple more thousands of homeless people
Alotta liberal parents will be having their kids move back in
The MREs on his table makes it.
Love the Office Space calls backs.
Cornhole meant something different when I was a kid. 😳
I recently retired. My health was the main reason but the current environment was way up there.
Excellent! And accurate  Lol
I think that the former Twitter employee went to Tesla for a job application there.  Kinda ironic cuz Elon Musk owns it. 😁🤑
I'm sorry to hear that , Miss.  Honestly,  are you though? 🤣🤣
😝😝
Haha! Ordering breakfast or lunch and having to pay for it may cause a psychological break for her.
Haha...  Loved it!
This is reminiscent of Office Space!
Thanks for the smile!  Keep it up.
She's IRS material for sure...
I waited 5 minutes to watch this video. I have to say it was worth every minute
CORNHOLE!
he was tooo nice... also you can totally make a series from that
At least if they put this video up on Twitter, that will not get them banned 😂😂
It's a place where academically uneducated people work, this is exactly where these people should work.
Luckily these twits all still live at home with their woke non binary parents so they'll never bother us in the real world
I laughed so hard when she was repulsed by the word, "work" at @0:44 haha!
Loved it.  I was a roughneck on drilling rigs for a couple of years.  It's not the hardest job I've done. Dirty hands just means you're working.  You could be unemployed.
🤡🤡🤡🤡 When fiction became truth. Bee is on it ...again!
Here before it gets banned for hate speech and disinformation!
Lolol
Haha that’s like 80% of Californians.
New series on the making!!! Dirty Jobs theme plays
These guys and gals , are good  Not much makes laugh any more.  ♥️👍🙂
This cannot be more wrong about how demanding it is . Tech jobs are hard . Of course you uneducated people without any degrees who just complain would not know anything
I couldn't imagine being afraid of dirt, especially since I'm a mechanic in a Japanese owned dirt factory.
New phrases they can learn: "Medium or large size, sir..." "Is there someting else we can add to your order, sir..." "$1.00 is your change, sir.."
You are killing it ! They have a target rich ideology that will make these memes  last for years.  The part that makes it funny is you didn't stray to far from the truth.
Hell Ya!
Another great video!
You forgot the part where she says she "was let go" for being sassy to Elon Musk on Twitter
nice
i thought she was gonna puke caus he said miss
What would you say. You did there???
The future is doomed.  :)
Satrsucks awaits for them
Mmmm Lena Paul
I didn't know Project Veritas co-owned the Babylon Bee
I love Babylon Bee, but 55 seconds before the video starts I don't love.
Again,  Classic BB! 😁👍
Sadly, this is me in a job interview..
The Bee is awesome!
Unfortunately young people everywhere are like this.
When she saw his greasy hands I thought she had been triggered by partial blackface
Was there an "Officespace" shoutout there? "What would you say you do?"
Poor thing must be traumatized after being exposed to real “doing stuff”
Thank you for referencing one of my favorite Office Space lines!
Learn to code.
LMMFAO, This is Epic!! Twatters getting Twatted!!
Guys, answer me a question: is exporting LEFTIST to Cuba or Venezuela considered trafficking of DRUGS OR ANIMALS?
Now that was fantastic I will sleep much better tonight
This will melt so many snowflakes.
Now I'm really thinking I don't know what a cornhole is. Cause I can't imagine having a cornhole sesh.
Can confirm, blue collar stuff has secret roof top Cornhole and mimosas.
Probably hardly exaggerated. I worked in a startup where some employees acted just like that and thought they were saving the world.
Hah
How about a day in the life of an ex Twitter employee?
Loved the twist at the end XDD
I'm doing manual labour watching this
BYOG XD Love it!
Work is a leftist trigger word. Fact.
you are the best
2 bucks an hour to do my math homework. When you finish the pay ends. You must divide out your own paycheck if you don't get an exact amount of hours. Edit: fixed hour
I just want to thank Elon Musk for returning all of those people to their rightful positions as baristas and gas station attendants.
Always remember the Project Veritas videos where one twitter employee said he has worked four hours a week in the last quarter.
How do you get to hell? Very simple: claim that you're innocent.  How do you get to heaven? Very simple: Admit that you're not Innocent, you're guilty and ask for mercy.  How to know if you're guilty or not? Simply: Compare your life to the Ten Commandments God gave you in the Bible. Everyone agrees that if people followed the ten commandments there would be no need for governments or police.  Do not lie. Do not steal. Do not commit adultery. Do not insult God by using his name as a cuss word. There are six more but let's just leave it at that.  How many lies have you told in your life?  Have you ever taken anything that didn't belong to you?  Jesus said, if you look at a women lustfully you've already committed adultery in your heart with that woman. How many times a day do you do that?  Do you use God's name as a cuss word? Would you do that with your own mother's name?  If you answer these questions honestly you know that you're guilty.  God can justly punish you and send you to hell.  Ask him for mercy. His name is Jesus.  It's as simple as this, The Ten Commandments are called the moral law. You and I broke God's laws. Jesus paid the fine. The fine is death.  Ezekiel 18:20 — "The soul who sins shall die.  That's why Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins. This is why God is able to give us Mercy.  Option A. You die for your own sins.  Option B. Ask for mercy and accept that Jesus died on the cross for you  ...
This is going to be good. It's not even starting for another 25 minutes and there are already 258 'likes'.
😐
Well, they can take some of the advice they were so willing to give the Keystone Pipeline workers..just go find another job😂😂😂
Babylon Bee should have on Millennial Millie sometime 😇
I'm thank'n this is gunna be a good'n fer sure!! I can wait...but I don't want to...but I guess I have to 🤔😉!!
Fired Twitter employees should be called "Twats" and of he fires "over 9000" of them he should become a grand Memelord
Get on with it
I'm looking forward to this one.
Ex-twitter employee: YOU CAN'T ORDER THAT!  THAT'S CULTURAL APPROPRIATION! CANCEL HIM! REEE!!! Customer: ma'am, this is taco bell right?  all i asked for was a mexican pizza
SCOWL MUCH?
MAYBE A CHARM SCHOOL ?
They won't be able to ban people irl
If there are 7 days in a week, how many rest days do I get?   If I am pretending to work while home do I still have to use they/them pronouns?   Does moving my mouse around the screen still indicate that I am working?
Im confident this will be epic...giving you a 👍in advance.
Walmart's always hiring
Guessing starbucks will be the potential job...
"What's my best quality?  Are you even allowed to ask that?" "Why am I no longer working there?  Because I called my boss a douche on social media. And for THAT, he fires me?" "Where is your sushi Bar?" "Twitter required us to do at least 20 hours of work every week. So I wanted to find a job that was less demanding." "Which room is the nap room, and how many naps ?"
🗿
Hell yeah!
Liberals are just conservatives in drag.
She wasn't laid off, she was fired like the rest. Good luck to these pampered censors of free speech. They'll need it
Burger King, McDonlds or Taco Bell?
There had better be multiple upcoming parts to yesterday's "S.P.A.Z." short or I will hunt you down and will fill your yoga tent with bees
I'm quite sure it won't be very "friendly"... Please be kind with these young arrogant millionaires : they know absolutely nothing about the real life. 😢
Wait until beef guy gets in here spamming his lunacy about his “rich twitter friends” and how we all should be so jealous of them. LOL. What a nut.
This aught to be hilarious 😂waiting for the shit show
