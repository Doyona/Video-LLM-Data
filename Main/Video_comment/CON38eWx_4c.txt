car seat headrest
Correct answers 9. Memphis   12. New Mexico State 11. Notre Dame 4. Arkansas beat New Mexico State and Gonzaga 2. Duke beat Texas Tech
Kansas! Villanova Duke vs UNC Then KU over UNC 72-69.  Rock Chalk Jayhawks!!
Getting none of the final four picks right is what he gets for going so chalk 😂😂
*sees his final four*  Hahahaha
Andy Katz's record for predicting national champions is 0-3 in the last 3 tournaments.
Rock Chalk
You were way off.
March Madness is named that for a reason but Andy being a so-called expert getting literally 0 final four teams right is a tough look
Lol, completely wrong!! 😈😈😈😈😈
You did so bad!!! 🤣🤣
wow you were not even close in the west bracket, seems you disrespected the acc
Lol
Hmmm I wonder how this turned out
Good job. Your right on. Lol
Busted
Your disrespect for Arkansas   Houston.  Please watch more than local east coast games.
Only close prediction was Tech.
ANDY.  Zero your final four predictions right.  Of course you picked all 1 seeds except Kansas.  Shame. You going to upgrade to elite eight to final four please do not pick Kansa you sir bad at prediction please pick St. Peter’s for champion  Duke looks pretty dang good no to PUDUE or fact zero big ten left. So your final four could be historically bad. First time EVER. 15 seed to eight. Glad u Picked Purdue. Peacocks dancing
Well you have Purdue left. Good job.
Ty Arkansas for winning. WPS!!!!
This suked big time.  You need a new career bro.
I am taking KU to win the national championship
Andy Katz is an expert watching every team every game and he don’t even know what’s gonna happen March Madness is the greatest
16:42 surely didn't age well.
You know your braket is going to get blown up when you have only 5s and lower in the sweet 16. Just pick all the favorites man you may as well
Iowa men and women's teams have been the most embarrassing B1G teams in the tournament! Iowa women out in round 2 when some thought they would win a NC after winning B1G regular and tournament titles. And men winning share of B1G regular and runner up in B1G tournament losing in the very first round to Richmond......
Gonzaga vs Arizona in Championship  Book it !
This aged well
All I'll say is Buffet's money is safe 😁
Saint peters says hello!👌😂
Iowa in final four 🤣🤣 so dumb!! *checks bracket, sees Kentucky vs Kansas in championship game*
Where are all the "Michigan didn't deserve to get in" fools today? 😄
Your bad Iowa lost first round
Oops your bracket blew up on Iowa!
Lol Iowa lost first round to Richmond
I also predicted Arizona would win it.
In the West your 50% uconn and Boise st gone
You sir need to quit this bracket stuff. Lol
This has not aged well 😂😂
My God this guy is consistently wrong.
After Day One Katz's bracket is probably in the bottom 20% among ESPN entries.  Nice call on Iowa, Andy.
16:43 haha Kentucky lost
Go Aggies. Should have seen this one coming Andy.
Those picks aged super well bud! LUL
I also think Arizona has a chance
I love u of h I see your point on why but im going uh
Calapari has got to go cant coach.
Good to know that even the experts get it wrong. He didn't even hesitate with Iowa or Kentucky in the first round. Gotta love March Madness
"Mr.expert" was just a tad off with his Iowa pick of them going to the final 4.
Welp...
Perfectly reasonable smart bracket... boom Iowa knocked off first round bracket is busted... got to love March madness haha
Iowa lol..
Who’s here after Iowa lost in the first round?😂
good prediction Andy.  Iowa out in the first round.
This video did not age well...
Iowa just killed my bracket🤦‍♂️
Iowa.... Yikes!  🤣🤣🤣
When he realizes Iowa lost in the first round…
Now since Notre dame beat Rutgers and you're wrong, wanna change your pick about Alabama and Notre dame?
Duke fan since 1964.This team of "kids" not mature enough for strong showing.But next year I expect more!!
Villanova for the win
The most chalky bracket ever
If michigan comes to play this tournament, they beat Tennessee  the matchup against tennessee is very good, its just the teams consistency is god awful.
This did not age well in terms of Rutgers lol welcome to March I guess!
So chalk
Indiana the sleeper
They need to start doing what ifs, like what if Norte dame won.. which they did
Hoping my bracket is still alive after noon time tomorrow lol
Prescient pick in that Rutgers/Notre Dame game, Andy.
notre dame vs rutgers his bracket already failed, notre dame won not rutgers
Bro really spent an hour to fill out a chalk bracket
Tennessee as a legitimate Dark 🐎
Gonna be hard for Rutgers to get to the Elite 8 🤣🤣🤣
Man ur bracket is done already 😳 picking Rutgers 😳
Already wrong lol go Irish
already wrong about rutgers. alabama will finish the job against notre dame. memphis will come out on top against boise state.
Gonzaga. And. Arizona nah every yr gonzaga chock I can't pick them but they are very good and have a hall of fame coach I would like them to finally win it
Our brackets are actually very similar except I feel like Gonzaga is going to lose to Tech and I got Tech losing against Arizona in the National Championship. I think Defensively they are nightmare against teams but Arizona is the perfect team to go all the way and win
I don’t think this will happen only think they have a shot so here’s a hot take for you....ark beats the zags and 3 of the final four are sec teams with auburn winning it all
Dude misses 13 games at least in the first two rounds. Horrible bracket
The absolute worst bracket I’ve seen from an “expert” this year. Dude isn’t an expert just an over glorified sports gossip columnist.
as a Texas Tech alum, it's nice to see the team start getting the recognition for the elite program they put together
Ucla is gonna win the whole not juzang but jaquez plus just need Bernard 2 put up more shots
I sure hope you're right about the Hawkeyes....
i definetly think memphis over boise state
I think VT will beat Purdue in the second round
He has no idea what hes talking about, He said Boise State is a veteran team that knows how to win in the postseason even though they are 0-7 in the March Madness all time...
Purdue ain't beating Kentucky. Go Big Blue 🏀. #9 coming our way.
The committee had some inexplicable errors. Tennessee was underseeded, should have been the highest 2 seed. Texas A&M deserved a bid.
I’m a UConn fan but I see Arkansas winning & maybe running, I think Gonzaga chokes & loses to Arkansas possibly Memphis !
Andy picked against almost  every sec team. Picked every big ten team to advance. Don’t listen to his nonsense.
Michigan State had an up and down season not really a trustworthy team. Davidson is one of the best 3 point shooting teams in the country. I think Davidson takes out Sparty gets a big lead early and holds on. 85- 79 Davidson wins.
Houston will return to final four!
Not much madness in this bracket. #weak
You think a guy named Katz would pick the Cougars, the Wildcats and the Tigers.
I have murray st beating Kentucky and Purdue
I genuinely don’t understand how everyone is picking Gonzaga so decidedly. They haven’t separated themselves at all in my opinion.  They get to the elite 8 at best.
Tennessee
GO HAWKEYES
Upsets along the way?  No one to take Gonzaga out in the West    In the East:  Virginia Tech over Texas in another 11-6 upset with Texas on the losing end (remember Northern Iowa?).   After watching IU/Wyoming, I am even more convinced that St. Mary's will beat IU.  Murray State will push KY, but KY will advance.  UCLA over Baylor?  Not likely. Purdue's size and defense too much for KY, I agree with that one.  I think Baylor plays Purdue.  It will depend on who comes to play.  In the South I think it comes down to Villanova vs. Arizona, which the Arizona Wildcats advancing.  TCU - Seton Hall will be very close, could go either way.  I think the Ramblers take the Buckeyes.  In the Midwest, I like the 13 seed, South Dakota St. over Providence.  One team very hot, the other not. But it does not matter much as Iowa beats either of them.  I like the guards of Miami to beat USC's length.  Iowa beating Kansas will be a stretch, but if they get past KU, yes, they make the Final Four.
Kentucky will beat Purdue
Everyone’s got a bracket. Don’t take it personally.
Chattanoga Cinderella
Rick Barnes is way too good in rematch games. Hence why after his first loss this season against Kentucky, they have beaten them twice since, once at home and once in the SEC tourney.  Since Tennessee has already played Nova in November I like the Vols to advance out of that game.  You mention Gillespie being too much for Chandler, but forget the Vols use 3 different point guards to get it down, so if Chandler can't run point he will be free off the ball to do whatever he pleases. As for Tennessee against Arizona... Tennessee has already beaten Arizona once this season who knows they may do it again and make their first trip to the final four ever.  I wouldn't count this team out so easily without analyzing them further. Tennessee and Purdue are VERY good 3 seeds that can make a deep run in the tournament. Can't wait for March Madness!!
Whoever asked which 16 seed had the best chance to make the Final Four, is either completely insane or just trying to make everyone laugh, considering UMBC is the only 16 seed to even beat a #1 seed. Also, that was such a strange region considering the Elite 8 was contested between a 9 seed (Kansas St) and an 11 seed (Loyola-Chicago).
I feel like Iowa vs Kentucky is a great matchup and winner will make the Final Four. Auburn's got great bigs, but their lack of elite guard play will cost them later on, especially against Iowa/Kentucky,.
I believe uconn could be the 2019 auburn both were number 5 to and I could see UConn doing so crazy things this year
Clueless. He obviously has no clue what it takes to win in March to have no upsets, cmon
Someone once told me that the Isiah Mobley show is coming to theater near me...at 200/1 !
NCAA Finals: Arizona vs Gonzaga
Happy March madness!  Let's go!  I'm seeing Houston cutting nets down.   Tough & gritty well coached with better shooters.
Can’t wait for Purdue to lose to Yale 😂
Not suprised Andy went Chalk, dude never goes out on a limb with Big 10 bias
I miss you on espn and the always popular baracketology
Kiss (Bryant) Vs Kerr(Zona) In the first round has the Chance to be electric with the amount of Trash Talk going on between the two
so much chalk
Your choice of Iowa over Kansas is a little risky. Iowa's offense amounts mostly with Keegan (23.6 ppg) and that's cancelled out by Kansas' Agbaji (19.7 ppg). The difference in this matchup will be Iowa's poor rebounding numbers (ranked only 262 in the nation) which will ignite Kansas' transition offense and allow for second chances off missed 3s on the other end.
Andy seems like a bit of a Big Ten homer. I don't think the league sniffs the final four. Any of them. Iowa and Purdue? Do they ever do anything? Their league was way better a year ago and got shot down. Just can't see it this year either. Wisky and Illinois don't do it for me either.
We got to get you to a different conference tournament. B10 is the conference of disappointment every March in this tournament
Andy, thank you for  this show, I had some different picks but liked your format and opinion. Best bracket show I've seen this weekend.  Kb
My guys goin chalk pretty much except for iowa give nc a chance agianst baylor
I have Zona beating Kentucky in the final.  I'm an AUBURN fan and I have us losing to Wisky.
Thx!
Come on guys its all fixed and Duke and Coach K will ride out as a  Champ@!!!!!! Don't like Duke but its all made to fall into place
take the opposite picks of this guy.
Another blind Big 10 apologist 😂 Pay attention to prior tournaments. Big 10 has potential for a couple teams to do well, but I guarantee you will see a few of the big names out right off the cuff. Wisc is the only truly dangerous team in that conference this tournament IMO.
Music so loud I could barely hear the basketball talk
I have Memphis making it to the elite 8
Kentucky has the right losses at the right times throughout the season. Very rarely does a team win their conference tournament and then keep the energy to win the NCAA. Losing your conference tournament makes you more dangerous in the Big Dance, especially if you're loaded with talent. Look out for the Cats.
i have same bracket
Purdue is NOT beating Kentucky!
Lol this is exactly my final 4 predictions
https://youtu.be/CvEzCkdgnWk
What yall picking for the east?
Mr Chalk unreal. Dude you barely have any major upsets and there is always afew low seeds atleast in elite 8. Terrible bracket. Iowa this is funny there gonna lose to Richmond and Wisconsin is losing to Colgate.
Love it! UoA!
Andy, Creighton did not get blitzed by Villanova in the BE Tournament? Did you not watch the game?!? It was close the entire game except for the last minute when Gillepsie (BEPOY) finally nailed a few shots.
Dude where are the upsets? WAY TO SAFE OF PICKS. sorry Mr. Katz.
wrong
Ohio state finna shock the world watch🤫
Were is Texas A&M???? Lol
Texas just might rise, but when you said Purdue over KU!!!! Lol I knew you were tripping!!!!
Let’s go Purdue!!! BUT we all know they’re gonna choke 😂
text
I'm an Iowa fan. Love the support. But Iowa always loses in the round of 32. But I hope you are right!
I’m praying that this is the year for the zags 🤞🏻
I got 10k ky beats Purdue
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
The time of judgement has come , you have been given a chance to repent , did you use your time wisely ? I have told you before I AM coming , repent while their is still time or else you will be caught off guard ..
Look, I'm sorry but over the last two-three weeks, Duke's defense has let almost every team railroad every chance they want. They don't put their hands up to cover defense. That kind of play is not goin gto make it to the FInal Four and likely the Elite EIght. Possibly the Sweet Sixteen depending on the other teams they are playing. Good luck to Coach K being his last year, but he's had much better teams.
You should NOT being picking Illinois over Houston. C'mon.
I hope he is right except for the last game  🚂☝🏽
VT has a Cinderella to the elite 8
stopped watching after he picked ISU over LSU. And I'm an Iowa State fan.
Iowa???? What am I missing?
Way too many Big 10 picks. Always a mistake.
I don't agree with all picks, but fun video. Half of the fun of this tournament is discussing what could potentially happen. I like how you take each region one by one.
Can anybody beat AZ wildcats there so Good?
I know Auburn has been off of late however all there losses were either in OT or by 5 points max so they are gonna be in every game with a chance to win.  There defense can be overwhelming and they protect the rim better than anyone in country and they attack the rim as good as anyone which is high percentage plays so if they hit perimeter shots with the best player in the country in jabari smith they can go far and can win the whole thing.
You got it wrong bro. No f*ckin' way Texas Tech beatin' Duke. Coach K is going out on top. #GOAT
Anybody but duke!!!!! Thank you!!!
Tennessee is playing much better now than earlier in the season, Mr. Katz may possibly be right, but I hope Tennessee comes to play.
No offense but Andy's picks are basically the top two or three teams thrown in with some Big 10 homers (like IOWA) that he likes in each region. There WILL BE UPSETS!!!! Write it down....his bracket pickets are NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!
Wow this guy is so big10 bias 😂🤣😂🤣 He does know that the big10 chokes year in and year out.
I almost have the exact same bracket xD
I disagree about Alabama loosing
Thanks
Tennessee is playing much better now than earlier in the season, Mr. Katz may possibly be right, but I hope Tennessee comes to play.
I got Illinois making it to the ship against Kentucky. Just feeling it
Man come on each divisions sweet 16 has 3/4 top 4 seeds it never ends up like that
This bracket looks like every middle schoolers on the planet 😂
In all reality, UK wins this region and gets to at least the Final Four.
GO BIG BLUE! BBN
I think Virginia tech beats Texas, and then upset Purdue. I think Kentucky plays Virginia tech in the sweet 16. And I think KY wins.
I think the tough thing about March madness is that you think a team will replicate their conference tournament success and many don't. Also figuring out those non power 5 matchups where you have teams that don't have many matchups against power 5 teams but they have the shooting or punt guard play to make a couple upsets happen
Kentucky
Texas tech gonna make a run. Watch. From a KY fan i have respect for the red raiders, they are legit when they are on their game
I LOVE Every1 is buying into Iowa! Not me
Creighton did not get blitzed by Nova. The game was close
Kansas vs Providence I promise
Iowa is overdue to cool dwn They aren't UCONN with Kemba
Iowa St is a TOUGH #11Seed
Iowa Hawkeyes is trendy pick. Iowa WILL NOT MAKE Sweet16!
LSU is going to the tournament without a coach and they’re gonna play the second to best three point shooting team in the nation lights out for LSU that is if they make it past the first round I feel bad for LSU and I’m very disappointed in that will wade coach
Virginia Tech wins they beat Duke
Well if you have an extra three hours to watch this breakdown and I like how Andy looks at things I would like to see Coach K go all the way ,this tournament, this season is heartbreaking knowing that this is coach K’s last year I’m not sure there’s been a greater coach in the history and I know Johnny V was great and he is great and will always be great ; Coach K besides what he did for Duke he stepped up when the United States of America needed someone to coach the team ,the redeem team back to a gold medal and he did it he did it silently as any championship dedicated American coach from one of the greatest basketball schools in the last two decades or however long he coached at duke I am the everyone of those players who got it play under him and see how he operates in see how people are supposed to live their lives and do the right things make the right decisions and no he may not win every game either way it’s too bad we don’t have more Americans like that dude this is the end of a generation of the greatest people and some of the greatest coaches thank you Coach K
Gonzaga & Villanova aren't making FF
Gonzaga #1 overall team ...that's hilarious
Yeah I'm warning you all! I'm a KU/BigXII guy. Baylor isn't the same team as last yr! Now Texas Tech? 4real  As for my Jayhawks?  Been a fan +30yrs and prob 1st yr I have no expectations for them. We get hot on transition and our 3 wings get to Free Throw line alot? KU has a shot but we just don't have any Frontcourt depth. 3s need to fall and like I said our 3 wings need be aggressive.  But I just hope we make it out 1st Weekend then we do that ? Never know!  Imo? Bill Self for National Coach of the Year. He has zero highly ranked recruits out High School on this team and literally has a SG/Wing name Ochai Agbaji who wasn't even ranked in tp300 players coming out High School!  He's now a LOCK at a late 1stRd/early 2ndRd NBA pick
calling it here: USC beats Auburn in the round of 32
Kentucky has a CAKEWALK to East Reg Final
Wyoming my Cinderella Sweet16 appearance
Va Tech is going to make a run. 4th in the nation in 3 point shooting. while also being very well coached and have solid big men. heck they  have won 5 games in a row beating noter dame, Miami, and blowing out north Carolina and duke. I'm not even a vt fan.
No f'ing WAY Gonzaga makes Final Four!  They are OVERDUE for a hiccup in an early Rd after last 4yrs of success. Even 4 Bluebloods have ton hiccups and rarely go on runs like Zags have last 4yrs even tho no Natty? Zags been absolutely A FORCE in NCAA Tournaments last 4yrs.
Memphis upsets Gonzaga!  Remember I said it.
going to be tough with Kerr Kriisa ankle injury.
Big10 gets +4 teams in Sweet16? I'll be absolutely SHOCKED! Think Big10 is like uzzz? overrated   Purdue/Illinois imo only 2 Big10 teams in Sweet16
Eye test? Needs happen! My Jayhawks almost got swept by OU! Both wins by just 1 possession. Then all other 1 possession games Okla lost and five Overtime losses? Okla still went like 18-15 (7-11) in THE TOUGHEST Conference in country. BigXII just CANABALIZED itself this season!   Okla had as many wins vs ranked teams (5)/ as Indiana & Michigan had COMBINED!  Sooners got f'ing HOSED! ! !
andy do you think texas tech can contain paolo, trevor keels, jeremy roach, mark williams, AND A.J. Griffin ?
1 2 3 4 seed in the East to the elite eight? Bold move
Here is where Andy is wrong, picking Nova over Tennessee. Vols making a big run into the Final Four.
Too much chalk!
Never underestimate Andy's ability to be biased. Kansas by 15 over Iowa.
Always look forward to this clown's predictions every year so I know exactly what not to pick, he never gets anything right
Why is vtech burnt out and Iowa isn’t??
Rutgers is gonna make a run
Tennessee > everybody
so many people will just copy this lol
Yall know it's March his bracket too perfect lol we all know it's gone be atleast 1 major upset first round
Like memphis over boise
one other thing. Big 10 is overated just like last yr..... no big 10 teams make final four
i like most of your picks. however i think purdue has trouble with smaller guards and ball pressure. i think purdue freethrow shooting gets them beat maybe by kentucky.
Gotta bring up JJJ, Fulk, and Plavsic. JJJ should’ve been SEC tournament MVP
Thanks but I’m looking for Nancy Pelosi and her husbands prediction, I hear they are really good a predicting things that make them lots of money
Purdue playing like dog 💩 right now
He picked Texas
As a Purdue fan I am happy you had them in the finals.  But are you delusional?  Have you not seen them play lately?  Turnovers, missed free throws and poor shooting from the 3 point range are a death nail for them.
Don't be shocked if South Dakota State beats Providence in the first round. Money line is -2 on that game, basically a pick'em game. He is right they don't have a Mike Daum type player but they do have 6 or 7 guys that can score 20 any given night and 4 guys that can hang 30. Their 6th man had a 41 point game this season. Providence will not be able to key on just one guy on SDSU, which was always the problem with the Daum teams. The Jack's went as Mike Daum went. Don't be surprised if this is 1 point game either way. Also don't be surprised if State beats them by 20. I've watched almost all their games this season and although they are ridiculously efficient from beyond the arc there have been games that teams have taken away the 3 and they absolutely bludgeoned their opponent in the lane! Remember the name Baylor Scheierman he will be the matchup nightmare. Plus their D isn't talked about a lot because they are such a high octane offence.
Roll spideesssssss gilyard will pick bohannan pocket all day long
2 B1G teams in the FF? Not a chance! You just wait, the B1G teams will all fall one by one like a flies in a couple of days.
WOOOOOO!! GO CATS!! 🐻⬇️ U OF A!
You’re telling me all 12 of the 1-3 seeds get to the sweet 16? And no teams higher than a 5 seed get hot? I enjoyed this video but these are brutally robotic picks😂
Go Memphis Tigers!!!
Hokies are about to prove everyone wrong
This genius had Arizona not making the tournament  this year. 😒
Tennessee final 4 Andy you should know that
I just don’t love Purdue because of that defensive stat. It’s hard cause Va tech is shaky and UT loves to choke, but I feel like the winner of that game can beat Purdue
28:30…”Gabe Layden” 😂😂😂
I"ll put money on my bracket over this guy. How does he get paid to do this. Just a lot of talk.
Busted bracket cheat code right here
Wow.  Katz is down on the SEC apparently.   I disagree about Arkansas, Alabama, and Kentucky.  I could see 4 to 5 SEC teams in the Sweet Sixteen.
Go Hawks!
Dude drink water stop smacking in the microphone
No offense but I think Andy's been watching a bit too much Big Ten basketball lol. I'm an IU fan so I get it, but a little overly generous to the Big Ten programs here. Purdue looks terrible right now - playing some of their worst basketball of the season. Iowa is on a hot streak, but historically conference tournament champs don't tend to fair well. And at some point their overreliance on the 3 is going to come back to bite them. One cold shooting night is all it takes. I just don't see any way either of them makes it to the Final Four. If I have to pick one Big Ten team to make the Final Four, it's Illinois. After that, it's a toss-up. Indiana is playing some of the best basketball in the country right now. Iowa is too, but again they are reliant on the 3. Anyways. I'll stop nitpicking. It's easy to always find something wrong with everyone's bracket lol
I really like the Virginia Tech pick though. Very hesitant of that ISU-LSU pick as well. Also UCONN consistently underperforms so I’m not totally on par with where you put them.
😂 Purdue (Per don't) and Iowa (🌽)? 🤪 How did those Big 10 teams fair in the Tournament last year? 🤔 All but 2 were gone after the first weekend! ☹ What is better about their teams this year? 🤷‍♂️ Absolutely nothing!🤦‍♂️ Your Right About Gonzaga and Arizona! 🤴 But, the Big 10 is a "Big Bust" Again! 🙃
Purdue is losing to Virginia tech And I attend that school Purdue is very inconsistent  It's the hard truth But if they do win against Kentucky then I will never doubt them again #boilerup
Rutgers over Bama? Okay dude.
This guy is just sitting there guessing I could do the same thing wow wish I had a job making six figures just bullshitting America Legos for politicians to
Glad you took Iowa State over LSU. I do think Iowa State beats Wisconsin though and makes a sweet 16. Could we see an Iowa vs Iowa State elite 8 game?? Would be pretty incredible!!!
Obviously you never know how things will shake out but if Tennessee plays their best basketball, they will go deep in the tourney.
Sleeping on Houston like crazyyyyy
Michigan only got in for 2 reasons: politics and dollars.
Iowa in the Final Four? Zero chance.
arizona never makes it past elite 8
what a safe and boring bracket
Soooo you dont have any upsets in the first round lol? Throw your bracket out
I think the vols make elite 8.
baylor is just not loosing to ucla
A lot of chalk Katz. You know better
Who y’all got!?!?
The Zags are overrated.  Hammered by a bipolar Alabama team. Arkansas runs the table in the West.  Defense travels.
UConn is not beating Arkansas
Big 12 is not that good I can’t pick them they never show up
1,2,3,5 1,2,3,4 1,2,3,4 1,2,3,5; on paper this round of sixteen looks perfectly logical but through history when or how often has the entire bracket ever gone that close to seeded form? There has to be a couple of teams that are going to muddy up the expectations coming from somewhere.
Katz ur awesome but Purdue not goin final 4  we are playing terrible
Too much chalk
Murray state vs kentucky in second rd is intriguing Kentucky's national title contender and Murray State have a 20-game winning streak, racers only two losses and one was at auburn , since that 13 point loss they havent lost. Kentucky needs to be ready it'll be tough
Tennessee  got robbed and Kentucky should have been a number  3 I don't know how's running the ncaa they don't know what they are doing
RJ Lewis?
I think his bracket is messed up I think loyala Chicago can make a deep run and I think uconn will lose vs new Mexico state
1 Gonzaga.                                              1 Arizona                       Gonzaga.                                  Kansas                                      *KANSAS*   2 Kentucky.                                              1 Kansas
I like iowa too
Andy is just talking to talk. How can you say Arizona va Iowa is going to be a 95/93 game yet you turn around and say the size of Arizona is gonna be too much for Iowa? Doesn’t make sense. If it’s gonna be that close then nothing is too much for neither team.
Nova definitely make it to the final 4 and beat zona playing crazy defense there experience gonna take over beat them I think close I think novas experience take over and win the game
Get your Guns Up, Red Raiders!👆🏻❤🖤👆🏻❤🖤
My final 4 was pretty much the same. The only difference was that I had Auburn beating Iowa and then in the championship I had Purdue beating Arizona. SDSU is beating Kansas by the way I don't care what you say. Every year there's always the one 1 seed that loses in the second round and this year it's gonna be Kansas.
Thank you Andy for doing this I’m a huge Duke fan do you think they have a good shot to win it all even though their in the most difficult region & do you think Loyola Chicago can make some more March Madness magic
I think Davidson is going to be an underdog team.  I predict Davidson will beat Michigan State and Duke...  And find their way to the Final Four!!!
Andy, thank you for  this show, I had some different picks but liked your format and opinion. Best bracket show I've seen this weekend.  Kb
i have uconn beating the Zags
This bracket bout to BUTCHERED! I’m no “analyst” but that’s probably why my bracket will do better then this. 😂😂
Vermont to the Sweet 16, book it.
Andy you are fantastic and knowledgeable but this is march, I know you want to see these awesome matchups in the SS and EE… BUT THIS IS MARCH. Take a shot and put your neck out there for an upset! There will be at least an 8 or higher that fits in the glass slipper.
His excuse for Virginia Tech losing in the first round is pathetic. Doesn’t give any compliments to both teams, only that VT will run out of gas. VT is the dark horse this year. Elite 8 potential.
I dont think this guy watches games. Auburn has been sliding off a cliff recently. Tennessee probably the hottest team entering march madness, having already beaten arizona, kentucky twice, auburn, arkansas twice. I think auburn gets knocked out before sweet sixteen. Tennessee gets to at least elite 8, final 4 possible.
Love you Andy but your highest seed to go to the sweet 16 is a 5…
You're high if you think Boise St is gonna beat University of Memphis LOL
ya im not taking that much advice from this video dude literaly has no upsets and has 1-4 seeds advancing till sweet 16
Bro hates an upset
The uk hate
Of course texas gets the best 11 seed ever
I have put Purdue and Arizona in my final 4 way too many times and they always let me down. Not this year.
So chalk
Wisconsin is gonna Win it all
How Boise been there b4 and we beat them last year in the NIT on the way to the championship🧐
There will be double digit seed in sweet sixteen.
bear down!
Honestly, if we got an Arizona-Purdue championship game, I would not be opposed to that!
Go Blue!
Iowa really?
Montana St. Final Four Bound.
Looking at the tourney I think it is going to be great and most years it is, the 4 number 1 seeds and I am sure I am not stating what you guys already know and prob does not mean much but all 4 have been beaten by SEC teams this year but all those games were earlier but not that long ago sense that happened but interesting, BAMA beat Baylor and Gonzaga, Kentucky beat Kansas and Tenn beat Arizona.
yale a lock
I'm glad the tournament is back with fans. Sad that in 2020 we couldn't see the teams like Dayton and San Diego State among mid major teams with seeds above 4
You really have duke losing to Texas tech
tennessee is my winner pick
Arkansas over UConn!!!
No sec team????  In final four??? Really??
His brackets r so funny bc they are straight chalk
I`d love to Purdue in the final four...but watching them the last few weeks..don`t think it will happen..too many turnovers and bad free throw shooting
Where is Tennessee Andy??
Ucla vs uk
UK ro the 8
That’s the problem with these analysts, they go all chalk, a double digit seed has won a couple games pretty much every year
Creighton did not get "blitzed" by Nova in the big east title game. CU took the lead with about 4ish minutes left in the second half and was in it for all 40 minutes. Creighton has 7 quad 1 wins plus a win over BYU and has improved drastically over the year.
He lost me when he said Perdue was gonna beat kentucky
lets go providence
I genuinely believe Kentucky will play way better then people think.
Let's go Hogs, take out two northeast tiny states!
Sounds like you know the tiniest amount about each team.
Final Four will have a Sec Team
final four-   zags v kentucky                     arizona v wisconsin  perfect bracket incoming fr
Write that down, write that down!
stop the VT disrespect. they’re cutting down the nets this year
nice job appreciate it
Andy just made this Hoosiers day
I haven't filled out a real bracket yet but a quick look has me at UCLA, Texas Tech, Arizona & Kansas.  Good luck everyone.
don’t sleep on south dakota state. they’ve got a couple studs in baylor schiereman and douglas wilson. i could see them going far
I would not sleep on the pac 12, see what they did last year with 3 in the elite 8
Disrespecting Bama 😤
Don’t underestimate Bryant
Go
Sleeping on Rutgers
Love it!!! Go Hawks!!!!!!
I got Arizona too
Tennessee is playing much better now than earlier in the season, Mr. Katz may possibly be right, but I hope Tennessee comes to play.
South region is stacked.
Vermont over Arkansas all day
Purdue will lose to Virginia tech.
Did you seriously just call ucla and Indiana a blue blood lol. Both of those teams are only remembered for coaching and not culture
Kansas Wisconsin midwest regional final...Wisconsin wins...home crowd and Kansas chokes here
Thank you Andy for acknowledging Georgia State as better than a 16 seed.
I got Rutgers going to Sweet 16
bro Virginia tech is hot, you have friggin Texas
Purdue. beats Gonzaga . Hot offence looses to a team that has no defense come on please.
Here I am thinking the Spiders are my sleeper in this region
I have Arizona and Kentucky, I would’ve had Tennessee but bad matchup with Arizona.  Final Four picks Gonzaga Vs Kentucky Arizona Vs Providence
This guy just does not like the south…sorry but your bracket is awful!!!
Murray State will be in the final four
Purdue overrated
uab elite 8 run. Y'all aren't ready for Jelly time!
Memphis winning the natty. Book it
Time to fade this nerd
How did A&M not get in but Michigan got a bye?
