Can Italy make a run?
I am not a fan but this looks amazing on a dress like that and it is very cool to look like it would fit in the middle and the sides of your head in a suit like this is a great
Italians vs Spanish speaking Italians
مالي علقة بي اي واحد ولا في كرت القدم مازن لو مسوي طيزو ليزر كوله مستحيل انام عليه والمفتاح لازم اني يكون  مالي علقة اقربائي اذا مشركين مازن لو اخوه هاي مشكلتهم هي مين كلهم يشركون فروخ ليش خلصو الشرفاء بي هل عالم علمود يشركون فروخ يعني مشكلتهم هي مو مشكلتي اسف 🤷🏻‍♂️
Italy straight dominated 🇮🇹
These are pros ?
Vamos Colombiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ese equipo de Argentina no tiene nada
Argentina has no attacking forwards.
Italia vs las meseras
What a beautiful doll… I mean goal.
Italian women are as dramatic on the field as the guys lol. I was rooting for Italy.
Crazy good offside traps by Argentina
GRANDE!
I’m Really sad they lost because it was a technical error by the coaches who did not substitute on time .. they have done this before I just don’t get it
. F.f.f .😢
Italian girls deserved to win.
🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽
I don't understand limiting the video lengths to 5 minute highlight reels.  There were 6 yellow cards handed out, so it must have been a brutally tough game.  But, you don't see that in the highlights.
looks like the argentine's should get a tall transgender "woman" to play goalie. epic game. good teams...
Siuu
These refs do know the offside rule I hope. Because the first Italian goal was clean.
Forza Argentina it’s not over till it’s  over
Regardless if it’s men or women, when Italy or Argentina play, you know it will be exciting in the last 5 minutes hahaah.  Allora, congrats on the header Italy!
Italian vs con los que se creen Italianos...
Women Argentina will champion afternative Men Argentina
Argentinas defense = 🤡
Wow 🤩 amazing soccer
The score line belies the deadliness of the Italian offense.
Once again, the dumbest rule in soccer almost costs a team the game. This should have been 3-0 for Italy.
It's funny how many times these players are offside...
3-0 Italy
shouldnt have let that ronaldos wife and garnachos mom yamila rodriguez to play for argentina...garnacho and ronaldo are curse for world cup
italy was stronger
Brave ragazze! Well deserved. Now heads up toward two tough games.
I hate watching how some of the defenders just give up and let the opposition get past them. Female defenders need to pick it up.
This is shameful we do not have complete coverage and have to watch this on Y Tube
Sin penales regalados, sin ayuda arbrital Mafiatina son nada jajjajajjaja
Italy's attack is looking in sync and rapid. Should be a fun team to watch
Messi and boys lost their first game … just sayin’
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
too bad that lionella messi retired.
,😂😂😂😂
some people think that , just with the name of the team , they will scare the opponent.
I think something that should be done away with is when a defender is caught out of position and decides to raise there hand and instead of following the play through
Italy vs Italy 🤔😏
Great job Italy 🇮🇹
How is the Argentine men soccer team hotter?
I'm starting to like womens  futbol more than men's futbol because they just play not cry or fake
Italy deserve to win.  Great team work.  Proud of ladies from the land of Michelangelo, Bernini, and Vivaldi.
Sooooo ANNOYED DIRECT TV HAS FOX BLOCKED during the Women’s World Cup over contract issues. Not the time to do this! 😢
Soccer has most stupidiest rule called offside. Players getting ripped of from making goals. Its irritating. They should erase that offside from the law or book. Italy scored 3 but only got 1 goal. How do they should play, and  attention when they running by their opponents.
Are you sure , is women cup? They look like men
Messi Wife needs to play for the national team 😂😂😂😂
Two evenly matched teams. Good highlights
Victoria Italian 🇮🇹 💙
New Zealand travel advertisment before this
Where’s Messi?😂
Just here to see the girls
Che bello per la squadra azzurra bellissimo gioco congratulazioni👍❤
It was a matter of time. Argentina got totally owned.
Brava Azzurri!!
Puras italianas
I think I just fell in love with italys # 9😮❤😂
0:29 bruh the timing is impeccable 😂 cometti
That was great game by Italy 🇮🇹
Never been into women's soccer, and never will be in a zillion years!!!
Is this on tv ? No clue women’s sports were on tv
Lets go Messi!
Italy has to learn how to play soccer onside
Argentina lose the first game in Quatar World Cup 2022, but win the rest of the games and Win the Cup.... Vamos Argentina
I have seen girls that can play soccer better than me 😅
These games are atrocious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
great refereeing and allowing the offsides calls to play out then getting the calls correctly. Great job to Italy - the wanted it more!
Bravo to the Italian team!!!!
No Lionela Messi for Argentina I guess.
Man the opportunities Italy had in this game and they only got 1 goal
Arg played nervously 2 easy goals they missed in front of the goal. I want Italy or Spain to reach the finals or maybe both ⚡
Very disappointed ☹️ in Argentina, how does the women's team look so awful. You're have the Argentine Futbol Federation, yet they look like missed placed teen girls playing football for the first time. Even Jamaica looks better than them!
Forza! 🤌🏼
Had to have been the most slow, boring game yet in the WC lol
i will say Italy was in much better condition
Where there's no offside! Italy could have that one in the beginning. lol Could've been 3 - 0. lol GG
Italia 86 minuti victoria 1-0 d'argentina!  Avanti!!!
That was legit the best and only goal I've seen from these games lmao the lack of power on most shots at goal are just ... Deflating.
Nothing wrong with the sport but I was really bored 🥱
Le Azzurre Look good. But 2 of the 4 teams at the end are going to be England, Germany, the other two is going to be difficult to figure out: US, Brazil, Spain, Japan, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy. I don't see France, Canada, getting there; they are too distracted with money disagreements and discipline issues. France and Canada will be lucky if they make it out if the first round.
The men soccer team miss 2 world cups , hopefully the women can get something. Go Azzuri.
Not too bad for Argentina, even though this team need to be rejuvenated. Italy attackers need to see the tape and make adjustments to the outside play; they fell to too many of them today.
Foreigner-owned Fox News matches employee contributions to far-Left and Satanist organizations.
Argentina is an old, old team; decommission and rebuild.
Italy controlled most of the game . And Argentina played with fire to many times with the off sides trap
😊
Could that one guy not find the flag of Italy so he covered up the eagle on the Mexican one? 4:05
FORZA AZZURRI!!! 🥰😍🤩
Congratulations ladies. Very happy ❤👑✊🏽⭐😇💯
Why the official be taking so long to make the offside calls
Women! please leave the beautiful sport alone. stop insulting it
What a beautiful goal
What a beautiful goal.
emigrants vs immigrants
3:50 no fuera de lugar😡
I've never seen so many offside calls in the opening round of a tournament in my life.
🇮🇹Azzurri🇮🇹
Some beautiful plays!
🥱💤
Forza Regazzi!!!
Watching women play is like watching a bunch of hobbits have a kick about.
Amazing win for Italy. They need to work on their off side
Lots of grit from the Italian ladies, well done against a though opponent. Too bad they got in such tough group… imagine getting Vietnam for your first game!
It's always good to see Italians in a World Cup...
FOX: You have to put in filler at the end of videos so Youtube's ads don't block stuff that matters!
Congrats to Italian ladies playing more intense than opponent. Argentina did not compete in this game.
Italian team win the game
This is the first time Argentine women's team played with such stamina and aggression. I even thought it was Argentina men's team and not women's. In the end, however, the women's side of Argentina was not clinical enough while Italy managed to pull out its last opportunities with a goal.
Good game. Thanks
Congrats Italy, doing what the men’s team cannot! Just like the USMNT 🤣
The *real* Italian team won
🇮🇹 dominated they got a 16 year old and an 18 year old startinf. They better finish #1 because #2 has a date with the best team back to back champions 🇺🇸
Off sides is the dumbest rule in any sport in the history of sports.
I cant get over the easy goals that the women score on the horrible gks
Argentina is technically Italians immigrants.. So its like Italy vs Italy ! lol...
Y yo me pregunto...a que juega un equipo...cuando no elaboran una jugada en todo el partido o hacen un tiro a porteria...excepto los dos o tres qe tuvieron a balón parado?? Entiendo qe te supere el rival...pero tu con tus capacidades qe entrenas?? A qe juegas??
third time is the charm
Why so many offsides already this tournament
Whoa, there are no highlights. It’s women’s soccer.
👍
If these are the highlights what are the lowlights?
Italy is nos Japan?
The only reason they lost and could not tie the game was the coaches fault for not substituting tired players when he could have at 20 or 30 min before game over
Where’s messi
Forza Italia! 🇮🇹
Love you ❤️💕😘 Be Vegan Make Peace Thanks God bless you 🙏💕🙏
@4:05 The guy bought a Mexican flag and covered it white 🤣
Italy V Italy
Go Italy!🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
The Italian girls are doing better than the men. Good luck to both.
Bravissime.  👍👏 comblimenti  siete  forte🇮🇹♥️👏👏
Congrtatulazion federazione italiana calcio femminile brava x Gol e bravissime 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
There's an argentinian missed goal which happened in the first minute of the match missing here...
woke up at 7.30 this morning to watch my girls play lol forza italiaaaaaa ❤
Siempre jugando con el freno puesto , vamos pibas a soltarse y a divertirse que se puede mejorar mucho todavía
To think, Italy ladies football just turned pro. Amazing.
😊 wow Italia win Argentina. So happiness. From Vietnam country ❤ Forza Italia
sono ridicole ,da fuori area non hanno potenza i tiri non arrivano in porta 😂😂😂😂😂😂
south africa still beat them
My second favorite match after France v Jamaica actually.
Para eso querían que nos levantemos?
I was torn on who to support in this match. Estefania Banini tying it in stoppage time for Atlético de Madrid in last years Copa de la Reina final still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Grande Cristiana!!!! Sei la numero 1!!!! Sei sempre la migliore!!!!!🔝🔝🔝 Vai Italia!!!! Forza Italia💙💙💙 Sempre così!!!!!!💙💙💙
Forza Italiaaa
Italy is the best. Itália eh a melhor. Italia tis nimjus. Itália és la mejor.
Forza Azzuri 💪💪
Esta argentina no juega a nada , todo apunta a que se van en fase de grupos igual que el 2019...
Argentina 😭😭😭😭😭.  Brasil 4.0 Panama😄😄😄😄😄😄
Vamos Italia 🇮🇹, buen trabajo. Espereba dos o tres goles mas pero igual estuvo bien. Saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷 P/D. Gracias por barrer el piso con el equipo anti-Messi.
Bravo Italia, bien ganado.  Desde Argentina apoyando a ustedes. Aqui la seleccion femenina de argentina odia a Messi, son detestables y espero que sudafrica y suecia las goleen y se vuelvan en primera ronda. Espero que el equipo italiano pueda llegar a lejos y levantar la copa.
Beau match des Italiennes !
wonderful girls go italy
Well done Italia. You guys deserve it's..
Nice
Golazo
Las nuestras parecen todas presidiarias ( algunas ni parecen mujeres ) . No pasamos de ronda ( contra Suecia se comen 7 ) . Saludos ... 🙌
You know youre in an American comment section when you hear people complain about the offside rule😅
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Imagine if Leo Messi identified as woman, he would have scored at least 10 goals.
ITALIA
Loving the world cup. These girls are crushing it
Grandissime 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
This is excruciatingly boring 😴
Vamos chicas. No pueden cometer tantas faltas boludas y tirarse tanto. Y que el DT tiene que hacer los cambios a tiempo.
Glad Italy won. The offside rule is so terrible.
FORZA ITALIA 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Forza italia! 😀🇮🇹⚽️
Whooo even though I was sleeping last night what a win for Italy 1-0 against Argentina Fortza Fortza 🇮🇹 🇮🇹
Italy dominated
All soccer is Women’s soccer.
Well done, Italy! 🇮🇹
Offsides is so stupid, it ruins soccer.
What’s with all the 89+ goals
Forza Italia!!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤
Both of these teams won’t beat South Africa
I couldn't get past the first half. One of the most painful matches I've ever seen. Mugging at center half. Can Italy make a run? Only cause they somehow posted a goal. Absolutely not if they play as they did. Even the classical beautiful Valentina Giacinti can't save them.
Italia❤
come svetta la Cri
Le Azzure 🇮🇹
Italy played well and win the match.
Another beautifully played game.  Congrats Italy!
Girelliiiiiii🎉
where is messi
ForzA ItaliA!
i f my thoughts not wrong italy should be winner of fifa word cup game.vary capable smart and fast
Tuvieron que regalar la mayoría de las entradas 😂
🎉🎉🎉❤
🤮🤮🤮
Good cross and beautiful header! Well deserved win for Italy who kept going at it till the very end!
Am here for the thumbnail.
Well deserved, Italy dominated the match
;g. h my loo/lol<
Cross di Lisa Boattin, Gol ITalia
Lezza ball is uglyb
Brava Girelli, da Nuvolera con furore!
The italian female football is growing fast. They will be contenders for the title in 10 years.
The name of the game is football, nothing else.
Congratulations Argentina for the win 😗
Brave Azzurre ! Forza Italia!
Unlike the NFL and NBA  that is rigged, they constantly use cameras to make sure they get the right call
イタリア､地味に強いかも
Yaaa Italy grest game guys
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
It’s the keeping that cracks me everytime 😃😃😃
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The game was boring. They spend  more time on the floor than playing the actual game. 🥱
Best game so far . Both played offensively . Argentina can go far with the gk being a safe pair of hands . I can support Argentina but must cut out the play acting [ disgusting ] .
Lrcdll era para asegurar el empate ya que parece que no hay dt de la selleccion femenina que vaya sin miedo... Lo de lorena benitez como "5" desastroso! salvo dos pelotas en el 2do tiempo una que quiso filtrar y otra en la que salio pisandola hizo moco tras moco, cometti recuperaba mas pelotas que ella, nunca estaba en posicion siempre tarde. Para que te demoras en hacer ese cambio de yamila rodriguez? Como vas a sacar a alguien que te ayuda en defensa (siendo que yamila seamos honestos tiene peso para correr) y no a larroquete que estaba fundida??? Ejemplo, paulina gramaglia es joven lunga presiona todo te ayuda en las bandas y es delantera, miedo por debut? En italia habia una piba de 16 lpm. Lastima lo senti como un regalo a italia po todo el laburo que hicieron me sorprendieron le jugaron de igual a igual a un equipo europeo con mas presupuesto. Solo deben atreverse mas y ser mas vivas (en especial eldt)
#9 on Italy is very pretty.
Argentina women team cannot survive in their group stage. Their women soccer team are still lacking behind in soccer world.
Italy is so exciting to watch!!
Thank you 😊😊😊
Cabrini is happy
😂😂❤❤❤❤
Does the commentator realize we can see the game on tv?  I do not need him to tell me everything I am seeing. Ruins the beautiful game
FORÇA AZZURRI...!
Do they stilll call the female Italian team the azzuri or is there a feminine version?
Italia Italia Italia 👍🇮🇹⚽🇮🇹👍
Do they skill call the female Italian team the azzuri or is there a feminine version?
They need to do something about the offside rules,,they gotta find a way to configure the rules,,, why is it the offensive player fault they get behind the defense?this is the only sport where it's a NEGATIVE...you need SCORING in the game and that's a huge problem...somebody gets open for a shot? goalkeeper gotta stop it
A whole lot of good women goalkeepers in this world cup
Juventus connection
well played! keep it up azzurre 💙
Too many offside what a joke where VAR !!!!
Wanna see Usa play against Italy
this is a joke
Forza azzurri ma anche forza argentina fratellanza di sangue
Italy is strong but the us is even stronger
Great header by Girelli to give Italy the full 3 points.  Well deserved. 😁😁👍🏾👍🏾 Cruel fate had this match been drawn (2 earlier offsides).
Spero in una finale Italia Argentina vamos!
Argentina  que esta derrota  sirva para  bien ,a poner garra y corazon ustedes pueden  vamos Argentina
Vamos las pibas, pero Italia jugo un partidazo. La defensa de Argentina para atras loco pónganse las pilas chicas.ojala demos la vuelta en los próximos partidos que quedan vamos QUE TODOS LOS ARGENTINOS ESTAMOS CON USTEDES ❤️🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Argentina 🇦🇷 need Messi for help 😂😂
Soccer's offsides rule needs to..... evolve... somehow.  So many goals being disallowed because someone no where near the play is past some imaginary line that changes as the play goes.
Italy vs Italy 2.0
What a boring version of football⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️…..
From the look of this game, the ladies are better actors than footy players
At least the women are in the WC while the men are home eating spaghetti 🍝 😅😅
Vamos Argentina!!
Those 2 goals for Italy dhld have bin allowed. Just a minor miniscule "off side".... so what. It's like when u c a perfect gorgous woman, perfect fitting skirt, perfect stilleto, perfect long hair, perfect lipstick, perfect body... & u complain to your friend... her handbag strap is a bit too wide.  Yeah... those "off side" decisions are niggly. Such minor things spoil the overall spectacle of the beautiful game. Fifa management shld seriously question the "offside rule". Comon guys. (Frm NZ Aotearoa)
Lol 🤣 they're both terrible... Neither will win the world cup 🍵🍵
Why did italy celebrate like they just won the tournament??
Go Italy Go! 🤩
Argentina women isn't that much strong
clean offside trap bro
These Weak goals 😑
i didn't see that coming in goal 1-0
Rough game for the ref.  Both teams were very physical, borderline dirty, especially Argentina.  I lost count of how many yellow cards were given, could have been more, maybe a couple of reds.  Don’t forget ladies, this goes to all the teams...the whole world is watching, show some class for yourselves and especially for your COUNTRY.
es como jugar sin porteras
Argentina Aldana Cometti CB #6 is very good player. I wish Argentina 🇦🇷💙🤍💙 all the best.
Super girls 😊🎉
Man argentina played so well, wish thry scored
Futebol sulamericano não existe no feminino 😢
Vamos argentina no pasa nada. ❤
Argentina deserved to win, its the best football country
Thank you
What’s up with the offsides 💀 and all these unnecessary rules. Smh.
Pls lives Philippines 🇵🇭 vs new Zealand
Thanks for not spoiling the result through the clip title / thumbnail :)
That number 9 deserved a goal and she was so cute too
Sloppy and unskilled player will create unnecessary fouls.
#6 Argentina did well to plant the offside
The 🤌 derby
very nice offside trap by that Argentina centerback
THE PINK TRIANGLES! for yall that don't know, pink triangles were used for holocaust victims, but now are also used to come out secretly, used as queercoding
Beautiful game.
For those who want to see original Argentina vs Italy: Link Below 👇🏻  https://youtu.be/PvgtsYwvMYo
Viva Italia
I'm sorry this is hard to watch , you are doing football (soccer ) a disservice by calling this "highlights"
So hard to watch lmao only goal was because the keeper is short af
Now that's a header! Top class.
That first offsides call was odd. The defenders were in line with the scorer and then they move back up the field just seconds before the score. I hate how thats enough to take the point away. Case point. If you wanted to maintain tactical advantage dont move back up the field and maintain your post. 😂
Women's game has so little excitement in terms of actual chances that they have to include every single cross, every miss, every time a goalie touches the ball and every sniff at a goal in the highlights for it to be about 5 minutes long.
Lesssssgooooo italy
#9 for Italy low key cute 🥰
ITALY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No one watches this game
Argentina played a dirty game, so physical, well deserved to lose. At first I was hoping for them to win, but so glad they lost. I don't like dirty players. Congrats to Italy🎉
Can Italy make a run?

Argentinian bulky to run
well done italy thank god argentina lost
This game needed so many more yellow cards, unnecessary reckless fouls at times
It really sucks that some of the games in na is around 1 or 3 am in the morning 😒😒💀💀
