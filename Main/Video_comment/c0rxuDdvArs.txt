Ik the person w/ the big Afro ain’t talking
Those two just pmo
There's only one person out of the three that have ever had proper ramen, the other two are making yakisoba or chow mien!
Why r they eating with spoons though
marcus need to get casted if they ever make a live action for coraline as wybie
why cheeta girl so defensive girl what they do to u quit being petty pls🥀
Ts is not ramen bro 😭 the only person that actually had ramen was Cheyenne everyone else just had the instant noodles crumbled up and added cold water
Maruchan is awful.
They must be so broke to afford a fork
Why do NONE of these "ramen" have broth?!
Why did they turn the ramen into like rice...
Olu is giving samara vibes
If y were broke how would u put chiicen in ir
Cheyenne's is the only one that has regular looking ramen.
Why does cheetah girl think ata gungun is the only ingredient they should use  😂😂
i just had an add for kraft mayo and they made a tomato and mayonnaise sandwich and it grossed me out.
Theyre all black the owner is racist.
Not Olu just out for the others and getting karma
Can’t nun of these mfs cook ramen 🤮🤣
Wait wait wait if they were broke where did the money for all the shrimp and chicken come from-
Olu 😮 wyd 😡 at least she’s got beauty on her side.
I just put the packet in and call it good 😅
“Struggle meal” more like suiside meal 😨 what are y’all eating this ain’t no struggle meal you’re trying to struggle eating 😭😭😭 just eat normal ramen bro 🤦🏼‍♀️
I can hear a distant "HAIYAAAA" with an orange polo shirt arriving😂
"i like the shrimp and its pretty good" **decides to give it a 3 out of 10**
"this sh*t dry as hell" 3:13 bro you're one to talk 😭😭
All of their ramen looks horrid
I remember on the camp bus a kid brought s bowl of ramen and there wasnt how water so he gave it to me and mg friends and we just poured the seasonings over it and ate it like chisp
Can we talk about the spoons ?
I thought they were ALL too dry, though the third one at least had a little broth. What these college kids seem to miss is that Ramen is a Japanese noodle SOUP; it's supposed to have broth. It's not pasta, where you cook the pasta then drain it. And the one girl first complains the Ramen is too salty, then says it has no flavor; the flavor (including salt) is in the packet that all Ramen comes with.  Ramen is very basic, and it's meant to be doctored.    -Always add an egg, allowed to poach in the liquid.    -Add vegetables to the water as you heat it to boil, before adding the noodles or the seasoning.    -Add other protein, like chicken shreds, shrimp, thin-sliced beef or pork.  Just pick up small quantities of fresh ingredients from a salad bar and use them over the course of the week, daily using to make your Ramen better. By varying the ingredients, the Ramen will taste a little different each day while not coasting much. Also, you don't need much shrimp for Ramen; when you pick up a $5 pack of cooked shrimp, just save 2 or 3 shrimp per Ramen you want to add it to. If you freeze them in a ziplock, you can pull a couple out whenever you want some in your Ramen.  What I like are tiny broccoli florets, thin carrot 'coins' (if you notch the edges, they look like flowers), napa cabbage, sliced mushrooms, snow peas, shrimp, the seasoning packet, the noodles, and a raw egg (the white allowed to cook, the yolk partly-cooked). Then, before serving, a handful of chopped green onions. But you need enough water to start, just to get the broth for your soup.
If there that broke why are they so picky about ramen😂
Everyone here eats ramen weird like, WDYM TOO MUCH WATER IT'S RAMEN
2:04 and then 2:17 GIRL MAKE UP YOUR MIND . Is it seasons or is it notttttt
I'm legit confused because I thought ramen was a "soup". Why are they surprised when there's liquid? I need someone to explain this. Can poor college students not afford water?
This is not Nigerian style ramen pls
why their noodles looks so... pale
I can't get passed the spoon 😅
40:25, that reminds me of Orwells 1985
Scallions, herbs, eggs, mushrooms, meat etc… Make it look nice, and what’s wrong with soup in your ramen? I hated everything about this episode, but I’m glad Cheyenne won. The level of conceit and ignorance though… yikes.
Why did they all make their ramen fucking without broth? Why is it all fucking dry as fuck
these guys pissed me off
olu was so mean and had such a big ego and it makes her seem like a really ugly person
Cheetah girl and glasses over there bitching about Cheyenne’s ramen having water when that’s LITERALLY THE WHOLE POINT OF RAMEN!
They kinda act like kids eugh
They all look nasty tbh
The ones that talk the most smack always loses
did he have to be an all out d in this
do those two mfs even know what ramen is? the last one was the only actual ramen 😭 what yall mean it’s flooded and it’s too watery? y’all piss me tf off
Where’s the soup!
I don’t get the complaint about water in the ramen bowl. Do people think ramen is served dry? I assume they’ve never had actual ramen before
6:31 how are you gonna say that and there was no shrimp in yours? 😅
HAHAHA Old girl acting like she invented spice, then got dunked on. this ones a strange episode. if you got shrimps money, you not strugglin.
“100% mines gonna win its the best” … 7:06
All of their noodles look disgusting
actually the cheetah girl is supposed to be a winner cause the title said "broke college" edition, that's close to representation as broke college noodle, shrimp? chicken? they ain't broke
it is a CRIME that only one of them made actual ramen. its SUPPOSED to have broth!!!!!! the broth is the best part!!!
How is adding chicken to ramen a different spin ? 😂
im ngl i dont like the vibe of this video. they sounded so closed minded and i get the vibe that they just think they're better than the others, or like they're above the others' food lifestyle. nothing's wrong with confidence, but this didn't feel like confidence. it felt toxic
bruh to go from eating proper soup ramen with charsiu and narutomaki to seeing these fools say shit like "why is it wet" actually hurts
I make the best Ramen.  My daughter loves it so much that she asked me for the recipe.  I boil mine until they're just about done and then strain them.   I put them back into the pot with the seasoning, butter and milk on medium heat.  Then I add cheese and basically pick whatever meat depending on which kind of Ramen, be it beef, chicken or shrimp.  Stir it all up, and when the cheese is melted, serve it up!  It's absolutely delicious.  Better than some noodles I've bought in restaurants.
ramen is supposed to have some liquid. the first two people have no idea what ramen is.
Break it up... throw away the seasoning packet or I use it to  make straight up broth on sick days.. then just eat them raw out the bag like chips🙂😂
This channel somehow manages to find the worst black people in existence.
I was expecting some hot dog with sandwich bread as the bun type of ramen 😭
Ramen with a spoon?
I know this is a late comment, but actually baffling that the girl who had the CHUNKS of dried ramen said that the other girl's ramen actually tasted good but it just lacked color, AND THEN GAVE HER A THREE? I feel like cocoa butter has gotten better about it, but they need(ed) to put some type of rule in there to make sure people weren't being selfish to just have their ramen score the highest
None of these ppl can make instant noodles
Handfuls of veggies save the day with ramen. Spinach, &/or broccoli, &/or carrots, whatever is/are your fave(s)  + an egg or any protein when u can!!   GOD BLESS 🔥
The African girl changed our whole story first she said it was salty then she said it didn’t have any flavor girl, which is it😏
“It’s salty” “The only thing that has flavor is the chicken”  LMAO😂😂😂
BRO MARKUS IS WRONG RAMEN LITERALLY HAS SOUP HAE YALL SEEN REAL RAMEN BEFORE!?
I drain the water and eat the noodles with the sauce! Sometimes I'll add peanut butter and peanuts!
Broke ramen and that girl put a shrimp on it? So she rich rich...
Why is the broth missing from these 🤢 no thanks
They sound like they hate each other 😂
Legit just add MSG, salt celery, chives and onion/garlic and make sure it has broth and it'll be alright. All these people have such differently different ramen. You can add an egg yolk if you wanted to as well. Or better yet, what comes in the package.
why do they have a problem with the last girl's ramen, like the watery part??? isn't ramen SUPPOSED to have soup, i'm not asking - its supposed to have soup..
Hii
Girl I use atadidi to cuz I'm from Nigeria
ramen is soup... and y'all don't eat it... with the water?   tf?
I think the cheetah print girl had indomie in mind and not instant noodles
Cheetah girl struggling to say Cheyenne’s is good 😂
I’ll take, ‘folks who haven’t had real ramen’ for $800, Alex.
2:46 DRY YOUR’S WASN’T EVEN COOKED
Uhmm people eat Ramen with no broth?
the “water” tastes disgusting and it’s very college to you to call broth water, and call it bad even when your food is dry as hell. Like the last one is amazing, def 1st for me. Like the broth is the best. no wonder why u like dry ramen, because your taste buds are dried like the Sahara desert
I like how they complain that it's watery when it's supposed to be a soup lol
the girl saying hers is the best is a bit of a b***h trying to correct everybody when she clearly dont know how to cook
Dried ramen? That makes me want to cook fried chicken—completely unseasoned, dry, and without any crisp.
I don’t think I like the girl with the Afro  and the cheetah shirt she was kind of rude
I find jt funny how they complain about the last one having water in it when the others were drier than a desert
It scares me that miss cheetah girl is a neuroscience major…
All of these look bland af I’m ngl 😭😭
The real crime in this video was using SPOONS TO EAT THE RAMEN
Ramen is supposed to be with broth, or "water" have they never tried ramen and olu is being so picky when her ramen sucked 😭
how the FUCK do you undercook ramen 😭🙏🏽
ok but like i leave water in mine because its like a broth when you mix it w the noodles.
I mean shrimps is expensive
All of them are dumb for eating ramen with a spoon, forks exist for a reason....salads and noodles
They got literally the worst examples possible. Have y’all heard of YouTube?
5:38 “I prefer my ramen *a little bit dry* GIRL WE CAN TELL..
funny how the one who is the most critical of others has the worst food.
"water" BROTH. IT'S BROTH. RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN BROOOOOOOOOTH
Someone's condescending! Lol "ingredients THESE people have never heard of". I thinks she's judging Americans saying we aren't knowledgeable of other cultures , but she's not knowledgeable about American culture....AND she's acting here. Disgraceful. Because crayfish is a COMMON Southern American food. Also at gungun, I liked it up, is  basically nothing more than a bland form of LAWRY'S seasoning, Old Bay seasoning or Cajun seasoning, just cayenne, onion & tomato powder... nothing different just a different name, missy!
Cheyenne is so damn adorable! Whenever I watch one of these, you just know the nicest one has the best food.
Whatt i like my ramen watery because i like eating some noodles then taking a sip of the broth thats just how i do it. Its so weird seen others hating on it. Especially the one who overcooked her noodles its in clumps. She said the girl's noodles look grey while her noodles looked like a biohazard think that can actually bounce if you let it fall
Cheetah Girl Doesn't Give Good Results Based On The Fact That  .. yes noodles are salty but added protein balances the sodium so Nothing Personal Lady But I Bet Those Noddles Were Banging 😅
They al suck 😂
Omg the thumbnail 😂😂😂
Wow I wonder why they don't think its soup instead water...
Yall might be broke but you definitely have a kettle RAMENS A SOUP USE THE SOUP PACKETS DAMN
TIL that an instant ramen recipe is like a child, a child that only a mother could love.
BYE WHY ARE THEY ALL MEAN TO EACHOTHER (I understand the Nigerian girls but😭)
bro ramen is meant to have “water” the flavor is in the broth
none of these people know how to make ramen - expect Cheyenne - hers looks yum
The guy with the glasses looks so hot 😍😍😍😍😍
They're complaining about the noodles having soup despite that being the natural state that Ramen is expected to be eaten, even dry noodles are typically pretty moist and have a sauce.  And you would imagine that broke college students would realise that making a soup is a far quicker and easier method of preparing a meal instead of individually cooking your ingredients
The title says they are broke college kids, yet they don't like and they don't even want to try the ramen. The title is a lie... they are just college student.
I love how Olu thought she’d be the Main character but ended up being the jester
Cheetah print is a horrible human.
I’m sorry but Olu pmo
Not olu disgracing us Nigerians 😭😭😭please we don’t claim that Ramen
It's as if none of them have read the instructions on the package, or actually had a real bowl of noodles before.
I guess it's entertaining to showcase bad cooking.
cheetah girl is giving me pick me vibes. she really said “this looks kinds dead” “whoever made this definitely tried.” “shout out to the shrimps that saved the day” like gurl..🤡💀 #getawayfromme😆
“It’s taste like someone tried to put some cheese itz in there” 😭😭💀💀💀
Dude ramen is literally a kind of soup it’s supposed to be watery
Why is everyones ramen so damn dry mine is usually a damn soup
All these ramens suck
chives, cilantro, lime, bean sprouts, mushroom, tai basil, hard boiled egg.  10-15$ can make about 2-3 days worth of food.  If you have nothing then just eat the packet itself, but if you have extra then add chili oil and some sort of meat.  Depends on the budget.
6:39    Girl yours looks bland....as hell and she still talking shi, about other peoples ramen but  talking about the good things about her's and so many people pointing out the bad things about hers 😂
The audacity to give TIPS 😂
I love how the overconfident one eventually lost at the end
IM CRYING WHERE IS THE BROTH
Most ramen is made with water..? I’m so confused it turns into a broth with the seasoning and heat 😭 “feels slimey” next time I feel like it should be people who have ate ramen before on the show.
I have 100% confidence I make the best ramen
WHY ARE ALL THESE RAMEN SO UNCOOKED
“I prefer my ramen a little dry” girlie we know 😭
how do you fail at making instant ramen 🙏
“Whoever made this tried” gurl did you try😂😂😂
been laughing ever since 2:03
i was excited to share a name with Oluwamayowa, but then I found out her personality..
"the ramen has no flavor" how much do u expect it to have?? this is broke college kids version..
the one girl being so arrogant judgy and nobody liked it😭. like no disrespect to nigerian food, ive heard great things about it, WHY DIDNT SHE COOK THE NOODLES?
That boy is funnyyyy 😂😂😂😂
im so confused, isn’t ramen with broth, and noodles no broth? even the ramen emoji has broth in it omg
Nigerians think they are better than everyone else
All there noodles look dry and cold 😬
“I like my Ramen more dry” then its not ramen… infact none of these were, the whole point of ramen is noodles in a soup. none had a ounce of soup except the last ig
“Broke college kids” more like kids who too lazy or dont know how to cook real food
Miss cheetah fine ass was talkin all that!!! lol. Then they read her lol. I wanna try this but I can’t cook. Love this channel.
6:39 she already planning to ruin the good recipe
2:05 the aRe yOu tRyInA kIlL mE was so 🙄😠
CHEYENNE IS SUCH A MOOD

Funny how the most tacky one lost 😂
All 3 of these r trash lmao
Not broke enough

I SHOULDVE BEEN ON THIS
Eating Ramen with a spoon is diabolical
"theres not enough shrimp" sorry, i thought we were BROKE COLLEGE KIDS?
DO YOU NOT PUT WATER IN UR RAMEN IS IT NOT A SOUPPPP?!?!?!?!
“The ramens a bit watery” ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER IN IT
it’s always the cocky ones that score the worst
Urn get better ramen in general like shin
I add crunchy chili oil to my ramen! Brings it up to restaurant level flavorrrr!!!
all of these look disgusting what is THAT
“I like my ramen *a little* more dry”
Do not piss me off right now
These are the worst ramens I have ever seen
Watching this kinda hurt
they don’t know what broth is. 😭 this video needs a redo.
Do these people even know what ramen is?  Last one was closest looking one to correctly made ramen.
Why the f did they give them a spoon to eat noodles.
All the water….. it’s a damn soup….. tf
Shocker, the one with broth won
"why is it wet" its ramen its supposed to be wet..
dang these college students got smth to say bruv when i was a third year i would just pack biscuits and thats my energy for THE DAY
Both marcus and Olu were ANNOYING AS HELL
6:19 BRO WHAT COLOUR DO U WANT IT TO BE? BLUE? she is literally flexing being Nigerian like we GET it
And black people talk about white people food… LMAOO!!! This sht is even worse! 😂😂
The three of them are just a bunch of brats who think they're the best at everything but they actually made trash with the most basic thing in the world...
olu seems virgin given that her ramen.
This gotta be satire
the filter on this video makes me feel like i'm color blind
"needs more shrimp" WE'RE COLLEGE STUDENTS SHRIMP IS EXPENSIVE FYM MORE SHRIMP
That nappy head can't even cook Ramen.. smh.. I lost 10 IQ points watching this..
im so confused I just use the packets why they doin all this
Everyone here sucked😂 atleast number 3 knew what ramen was

All three of these people just seem like rays of rays of sunshine now don't they 💀
Oh we know you like it dry 😭😭😭😭
There noteven voting fairly there just dogging on eachother
Guys I promise that isn’t the Nigerian way😭
all of these look foul but the first one icl..
Uhm so I’m 12 and o definitely make money better
I definitely think I can cook better than all of them 😂
The girl in cheetah print is so rude and she is being mean for no reason bruh AND HER RAMEN SUCKED
Ramen is supposed to be a soup….
Cheyenne’s was the only one that was actually ramen??
Please stop inviting such insufferable people wow, it was hard to watch Olu I'm ngl
Broke college student using chicken… bffr. Let’s maybe downgrade to egg.
cheetah print girl not messed uppp
I WANTed OLu To Win nnn AAAAAA
"It's watery."  Wait until you figure out authentic ramen has broth, honey..
The cheetah print girl gives me nerves, sorry but like she talks bad about other contestants when she got only 2 points😂
"I don't like all the water" WDYM BRUV RAMEN HAS SOUP
Idk about those dry ramen that the first two made. It was not appetizing
Cheyenne the only one that looks normal to me I just don’t like those mini shrimp 😂😂
i dont like olu.
So them basically talking trash and then they’re food ends up tasting horrible 😂😂
Ramen and dry in the same sentence is wrong
The cheetah girl hahaha haha 😂😂😂😂😂
What Happened to the forks this episode 👀
Definition of ramen includes the word BROTH. If Yall never even LOOKED at a bowl of good ramen, you cannot make a decent bowl of ramen
Miss puff needs to learn how to cook. No one cooks ramen and is that dry.
all those looked nasty af
all 3 look gross asf & why is there like no broth????
“mine has flavour and…” I can’t  “aRE YoU TrYInG to KIll mE”  girl what a pick me “this looks like mine” nooo  also 4:03 everyone hated her ramen
Why are they all so negative ong it’s just a cup of ramen eat it or nah but damn.. gets traction tho😊
All those ratings except cheyennes got me so mad
i hate peple of  colur
the girl with afro  hair said "to salty!" then she said the ramen had no flavor like what??
What the color do…
WHERE IS THE WATER?!
oh they broke BROKE
I'm shocked people eat ramen dry. All I know is wet 😂 and prefer it as a soup 😅
ramen is a soup.
Cheetah print girl:ITSS SALLLTTYYYYYY.  Pov hers:🌵🏜🐪🐫🦂
"THE RAMEN MATTERS" Her ramen:  🏜
Marcus's ramen lowkey looks delicious im not even gon lie❤❤😊
My go to ramen is: the og season packet, teriyaki sauce, scallions, and meats like chicken 👩🏽‍🍳🤌🏽
It's so weird to see people eat ramen without chopstick.
All of them were trash
KEN CARSON?!?
“It looks kinda dead” GIRL YOURS WAS DRY CLUMPS OF HAY WHOS RAMEN IS DEAD NOW?
Why is it hard do they not know it’s a soup😭
the first girls name be like: omawandghsm oogaboogac
cheetah girl says way too much knowing her ramen looks like she just ripped it out of the packet and broke it into pieces
5:40 ofc you like your ramen dry you didnt even cook it right
❤❤❤
Why they keep saying why it has water when it’s supposed to be watery
“I prefer my ramen a little more dry”   GIRL WE CAN TELL 😭
5:39 a little dry!? girl you didn’t even half cook yours 😭😭
Where's the broth.. 😦
"I'll prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" "I don't like all the water" As an Asian, I gotta say "WHAT THE FCK?"
No one thought about putting egg in their ramen??
I know this is my second time commenting, but I couldn't help to notice that the young lady with the afro called the ramen salty but proceeded to say it has no flavour. She is clearly looking for insults and excuses to give the dish a low rating so she could win.
bro whats the point of not having water when its ramen😭😭
cheetah print is giving massive ego trip
"this is watery"....um, yea. that's called broth....
The cheetah print girl gave me second hand embarrassment. How are yu gunna judge everyone else but then your ramen is literally just CLUMPS💀 She was all cocky but didn’t win,that’s embarrassing 😭 The fact she gave TIPS to😖
Bob ross looking girl is so mean
Omg... If they're really called broke college students why the hell are they giving such professional criticism at simple ramen? Broke people don't complain! Except that ponytail girl she has manners
their broke!
This video honestly was interesting up until the two started dawgin on ramen with broth.. are yall dense ? Do you know where ramen comes from and how it’s actually meant to be eaten… I was rooting for homeboy, but honestly the third girl had my full support she’s the only one that did it right. The second girl, pissed me off.
I was so confused because I’ve only ever eaten ramen with some water in it(aka broth) and the first two, especially the second one was so dry. 😭 third one looked so good though. I know you don’t have to have water in it but acting like it’s not a thing is weird to me lol
“i don’t like all the water” thats hurt me as someone who loves the broth.
What’s wrong with emmm they acting like some 2p5th graders fr fr
"I'd give this a 3 next" GIRL TOUGHT SHE ATE💀
Stop the way the cheeta girl said the boys ramen was dry made me actually laugh
why they eatin with spoons bruh
I’m kinda glad the Cheeta printed shirt girl lost. She was wayyyy too cocky, she kept hyping up her ramen even though she got a two. 😭 Also, why would anyone add color to their ramen…and why would anybody like it dry.
It’s always the ones that are confident that have the worst one 😅🥲
Why are they eating noodles with a spoon 😂
This isn’t realistic because if you’re a bro college kid, you can’t afford to go out and buy chicken and shrimp It’s just the Ramen  OK, I will admit there have been times when I’ve been broke and I felt like getting a little fancy  So I would add butter  Fresh cracked black pepper  Cold cottage cheese  Oh, and in case, I didn’t mention it, you don’t use this package of seasoning  Just the butter, pepper and cottage cheese  Maybe a little that cheap grated fake Parmesan from that green can
6:50 they tried because you didn’t..
more bothered by the fact that they’re using spoons! tf?
dude its not ramen if it doesn't have any broth
“Water” girl that’s broth…
who tf eats ramen without broth ?!
"I would perfer my ramen a bit more dry" RAMEN IS A SOUP NOODLE, ITS MANT TO BE PUT IN BROTH WHAT
Instant ramen is the easiest thing to make how did all of these ppl mess it up…
2:38 we all know it tastes bad and  it was NOT cooked😭
do people just eat dry ramen??
im sorry, why are they eating ramen without the broth???? (remembers i saw someone leave a cup full of broth in the sink room at my dorm) nevermind.
“I’m pretty sure this is gonna win”  “This sh looks dry as hell 💀”
I saw african girl’s ramen my jaw dropped like no way she had all that mouth and brought in ramen bricks 💀
The cheetah girl kept bragging that Her noddles were good and they literally said they’re dry af😂😂 No offense, please no hate to
i lowkey wanna try cheyenne's ramen, it looks good wit the shrimp
you guys can’t cook ramen, I was cooking homemade meals by ten!? 😅
The cheetah print girl took the ramen out the pack and just seasoned it 😭
olu needs to be humbled like girlllll
Omfg the guy in this video throws me off sm
My recipe: Maruchan lime chili flavor with shrimp, keep the soup and add  a bit of tomato sauce, mayo and that's it; keep it simple 🐢👌
has no color? nga yo doesn’t either in fact yo shi js clumped dry ass ramen gtfo 😭
Why r there always 2 *ssholes n 1 super nice person lol? No way theyre complaining about there being broth with their RAMEN.
These people never had ramen. Watery? What are you talking about? Ramen is supposed to be full of broth. Thats the half part of ramen.
what kind of ramen are they using?? is it a stir fry ramen or broth ramen?  I am so confused on why are they confused the ramen has broth?  do the other two only ever have stir fry ramen and they never knew ramen has broth? mann....I was a broke student once too but making ramen is basically an essential.  I could have lot of creativity with one pack of ramen even with just an egg.
olu was so uncomfortable complimenting someone else. says a lot
Where’s the broth at? How’s this ramen 🤣🤣🤣 uncultured people
Uncultured people
“It’s too watery, I prefer my ramen a bit dry”  You mean uncooked? 😭
That Olu girl yaps too much, literally had to fast-forward her part
5:39 we know sis… we know
The afro hair girl was too pompous and annoying, i hoped she fails dammnnn
I'd be happy to see the 3rd contestant's ramen after the first 2. "I don't like all the water." WHAT.... why and how do people eat DRY ramen??
im broke student too but my ramen has never looked that bad all of the ramen looked bad the last one looked ok
5:44 do these ppl not know that u put soup in ramen
‘Ramen noodle soup’ isn’t in these peoples’ vocabulary, apparently… I love dry noodles, but that isn’t ramen
Where's the broth? That's not Ramen, thats a bowl of noodles. They have clearly never had actual ramen.
5:38 You don't say
“I prefer my ramen a bit more dry”  Yeah we know.
“SLIMEY????” “TO WET?!?!?!” GURL WHATTTYTT
none of them know how to cook what is this😭😭 so much misplaced confidence
Marcus gin go far acting white 😂
Bold of you to assume broke college students could afford shrimp or chicken. All I could afford is ramen and eggs, some days I didn’t even eat. If I was hungry, I would drink water to make myself believe that I ate 😂
WHERES IS THE SOUP
5:35,I think ramen was supposento be soupy..?
5:36 bro ramen has broth its supposed to have water
“There’s not enough shrimp” BROTHER URS DIDNT HAVE ANY SHRIMP😭
everything aside tho, why they eatign their ramen with spoons?
The other two actually are stupidity what ramen is it has broth in it like I swear that second girl got me tweaking her ramen was the worst but she wanna talk about other ramen and the boy is horrible at making ramen jsut some dry stuff
dodo ahh ramen
3 idiots
What is their budget tho cuz i would like to know. If it was 3 dollars or smth i can make one rlly good...
aren't shrimp expensive tho?
the problem here was the cultural differences, she's used to what she likes (cheetah print girl) and they are used to different flavors, I believe it can be all good, but you just have to count on the fact that not everyone likes the same thing :). what matters is what works for you :D
the shrimp one is the only one lookin like actual fuckin ramen
omaywamo shindeiru
I'm gonna touch Marcus
All of these ramens are kinda crazy. It's supposed to be broth heavy!
bro that girls gotta be dumb or something there literally noodles tey have no color.
Cheetah girls ramen looks like rice no offense
How do you throw shrimp into a struggle meal, it's ither really shit shrimp or not a struggle meal at all lmao
Who had the idea to make this video💀💀💀
How is this a video
the cheetah print girl, said the guys one was dry and gave it a bad rating for that, when hers was even DRIER ANDDD SHE THEN COMPLAINED ABOUT THE WET ONE SAYING SHE LIKES IT DRY, she clearly aint fairly scoring, because the one she liked was given a 3, and even tho the dude disliked it he gave it a 2 to be nice, crazy how someones pity vote, is the same as your normal vote?
5:48 Alot of ramen is supposed to be soup not dry
first 2 made noodles while the 3rd girl made ramen,i mean ramen is supposed to have soup! like be fr lololol and I think the second girl was just being sarcastic lol
i can guarantee that if they had a fourth contestant who just made ramen according to the packet instructions, that fourth contestant would have won.
They don't have Maggie?
yall like ramen without soup ?? then that’s more like noodles/pasta.. ramen is a soup, so including the broth is definitely what makes a ramen obviously 👍
they did ole girl wrong asf😂😂..
"It's really wet."  Yes. Because ramen is a soup. When you drain the water you are then just left with ramen noodles.
the first two aint never seen ramen in their life.    'it has water in it...' yea that's what ramen is.
I will not judge the different flavour profiles people have due to cultural background but eating ramen with a spoon? Absolutely blasphemy
who eats noodles with a spoon????  am i tripping??
The boy sounds like Chris from family guy

Cheetah girls ramen was 🧱

The 2nd girl was so egoistic bro
ramen has BROTH!!! it is a SOUP😭😭😭😭
why yall so godsamn toxic bfr
As a Nigerian, I am firmly disappointed with my Nigerian sister from another mister. 😂 That ramen does not represent Nigerian flavor profiles and crayfish. My humble and deepest apologies😂😂😂
6:18 “its watery” … hello? Ramen is a noodle SOUP that contains BROTH, WHICH IS A LIQUID 😭
Have the other two contestants ever tried real ramen and how it is originally made. Maybe because they are broke they never tasted the real one or what is the reason. And how is it nasty if you add water?
6:31 bruh yall broke , do u expect to put that many shrimps??
Bruh the only girl that actually has taste buds is def the girl with the ponytail
Why tf they got spoons
Bludclaat
Wtf
"the water" YOU MEAN THE BROTH? ramen is literally a soup THEY PISSIN ME AWOFFF
Olu was so confident lol
"the ramens a bit watery" simba said calmy
for the record y'all please don't listen to cheetah girl, this is in no way how we make our noodles or ramen of any kind
bro please stop saying that is Nigerian, that is a disgrace, dry-looking trash
wdym the ramen is watery... ramen is supposed to be like a soup.
cheetah girl's ramen is about as dry as the death valley
Take away the ramen rights from those two 💀
It's noodles, boiled stop saying RAMEN FOR FFSSS
the newroscience major one, i am scared if she becomes an md she will be hella bad to everyone an djst mak e money
Olu having two and being the most confident is so funny
“my mama taught me if i had nothing nice to say don’t say anything at all so..” her mama raised her RIGHT
Olu was so fricking rude, she got her karma with her ratings
tbh marcus and cheetah print girl were pissing me off🥲
Did girl really just say the ramen was…watery? Girl it’s called broth
Who’s gonna tell them ramen is supposed to have the soup…..
Gurl the cheetah print is acting like hers is better because she added seasoning
The guy and olu were HORRIBLE
WHY ARE THEY MAD AT THE RAMEN BEING SOUPY?? RAMEN IS A SOUP WTH 💀
Cheetah print shirt, sorry hope she grown more after this
2:20 how do u say, it’s to salty are u trying to kill me?and then say the only thing with flavor is the chicken.like what?girly urs was in clumps
Ik this isnt really related to the vid and noone cares but am i the only one who drinks the ramen broth or are you supposed to strain it?
Lol low key this is why I cook for myself alone. 😂 Everyone likes different things and I don't want to embarrass myself or waste food 😂
I guess the take away is you make your own to your own taste and it might not appeal to other people
does the guy like dry or watery ramen like...........
That’s why Cheyenne won, ramen is not supposed to be dry it’s supposed have broth/watery consistency. And she added the right ingredients! I would try her ramen 🫶🏻
are they broke or spoiled? Chey is okay though
hating on ramen for being wet when its traditionally a soup tho?! and what does the color have to do with it? on camera they were all the same color!!
why is the cheetah  Print girl so rude? Every single contestant she’s rating them low just because she wants to win like girl lower ur ego ur noodles just look like a big clump of sh-t be so fr
When did ramen became a dry thing? We eat it with fork and a spoon bruh! Ain't nobody in this world pick up pieces of ramen with spoon unless they are munching on the raw ones as a snack 🤣🤣🤣😅
where’s the brothhhh🥲
Even tho im so late, you only need an egg or two to level up ramen bruh
the girl with the cheetah shirt is jus tryna win😭and failed MISERABLY
Why none of then have soup
GUYS RAMEN IS SOUP!  RAMEN 👏🏼 IS 👏🏼 SOUP 👏🏼   I’m so triggered
None of this is ramen lmao
Why was the Nigerian girl doing all of that like her ramen was not that good
That’s like 25 cent noodles cmon now
6:02 he’s saying there isn’t much flavour and his was literally salty
5:40 trust me we can tell with your CLUMPS of ramen
im not japanese but watching them eat ramen with no broth and spoons is offending me for some reason
She called the first guy’s ramen dry but she came out with UNCOOKED RAMEN😣😣
"Broke College kids" is wild you ain't gotta call em out like that 😂✨
What’s w people eating dry ass ramen all the time😭 I like my shi without soup every now and then but the soup be the best part sometimes
"it's watery" "too much water" duh it's ramen , there's 2 variety , a broth/soup and the dry one. Ramen isn't exclusively for "dry"
How are these people so bad at cooking noodles bro
Wow that so offensive to all those Asians watching this.😢❤
"some shrimp" does the shrimp identifies as they/them? Cuz I only see one shrimp in there 🙏🏼💀
"i like my ramen a bit dryer" LIKE YEAH GIRL WE KNOW WITH ALL THOSE CHUNKS LIKE WYM
"My first instinct is to smell it so that i dont eat anything bad, you know?" no girl we don't.
how did all of there noodles suck
all these looked nasty anywyws I dlam
My broke ramen is just the pack ramen and thats all lol
How tf are you Nigerian and you can’t cook indomie 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
they eat dry ramen?
when she said she likes her ramen “dryer” like trust we know 😭🤚
Bring kids that know how to talk and respect each other. So much arrogance in there.
i'm so broke i just eat the ramen how it comes
She had the adudacity to that she was smelling it if it was not safe to eat 😭
Those all sucked
When was Ramen 🍜 not watery ? Lies
The girl with the Afro said she prefers her rumen a little more dry. Yeah she prefers her Ramen very dry.😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think I know why the cheetah print girl likes her’s dry as Africa…
I can't decide which creature is more annoying
chayenne only one who won dis shi. who tf eats dry ahh crunchy ramen
uh ofc they all black...
Who the hell eats ramen without broth?? And like it “dry” 🥴
0:09 my friend has the same nameee she goes by mayo pronounced like maya in school
0:09 my friend has the same nameee she goes by mayo pronounced like maya in school
The girl with the cheetah print was talking all that but her ramen was so dry
These were all horrid
Always the biggest smack talkers lose
They don't like the water but ramen is supposed to be soupy not dry
5:39 + Dry like your personality? 6:22 - Grey like your personality? (Edit 2 I will stop doing these now :)
Ramen is supposed to have soup oml
so no one gonna talk about them using a spoon lol
All three ramen is WRONG just by looking at it. It needs to be SOUPY. It’s a freakin SOUP. It needs BROTH.
Am I the only one who likes noodlesoup...?
"theres not enough shrimp" "her ramen is to watery" while they got the most disgusting looking ramen ive ever seen. Cheyenne(last girl) is the only one who made ACTUAL ramen
At this point I think they are asking people to be rude.
Cheetah shirt girl has fucking DRY ramen and it’s in literal clumps 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
one minute this is salty, like are you trying to kill me, afterwards this has no flavor. GIRL!
Best ramen is with chopped veggies an egg red pepper flakes and other seasonings 😋😋
Who eats dry ramen with a spoon
Who the hell eats ramen without the soup...
Y they Ramen so dryyyyyy😭 where the juice atttt
The ramen was cold so it was chunky
3:55
No way the cheetah print girl said that Cheyennes ramen was too watery when it's supposed to be watery LIKE GIRL IT'S RAMEN URS WAS CLUMPS AND DRY LIKE THE SAHARA DESERT BE SO FR
Everyone is wrong, there is only one way to eat good instant ramen while broke. And that's just to mash up the ramen brick into small chips, put it in a baggie and toss it around with the seasoning packet it comes with. Ramen chips, and it probably has better texture than everything I just seen today.
the cheetah print girl was HUMBLED.
Cheetah over cooked not good I make my ramen good
has anyone else noticed that in these videos the most cocky person always loses😭
Why do people not like broth in their ramen… Are these people okay??
They all look disgusting
Oyster sauce, hot sesame oil, corn, squishy rice cakes, eggs (or Vienna sausages for a cheaper protein) and seaweed
bro my ramen is  a 10, proven by 8 diff people, cook it till the noodles are firm then set it away from the heat (it’ll keep cooking) in a bowl put the seasoning, black pepper, chili oil, lemon pepper, syrup, garlic powder, soy sauce, houses sauce, fish sauce, teryaki sauce and mix it, strain the noodles and put them in the noodles and toss them in the sauce then pour your preferred amount of pasta water
As soon as they said they dont like “water” i stoped carring about everyones opinion.
"Oh, I don't like the water" you mean the BROTH. Because Ramen is a noodle soup usually?!?!
omg, everyone, say it with me: RAMEN IS A SOUP, IT IS A NOODLE SOUP, PLEASE
Why do y’all hate on peoples food and some of y’all teens picking up or making random food like pizza or just all that junk y’all eats
“im pretty sure this is gonna win”🤣
U eat ramen with a fork guys 0:51
Y r they all so mean💀
"theres so much water" oh my gosh! water in ramen! this has never happened before!
I thought ramen was supposed to have broth.
What did i just watch
😂😂😂😅these people obviously don't know what ramen is😂😂😂😂😂
Some one needs to humble the cheetah girl
My Nigerian ex made his the same way.   Damn disrespectful😂
They be doing to much for there ramen like all you need is the cup of noddle some hot sauce and cheese
Notice the content of the struggling college kids character
Cheetah girl was so confident😭
Gurl i can tell your ramen comes with a different vibe which is "minecraft vibes"
Cheetah print didn’t cook and they weren’t hungry
do people not understand that ramen is soup?.... wdym you dont like all the "water"???... its BROTH??!??
Bro Olu is disgracing us Africans oml
Cheyenne's ramen SLAPPED ❤️
I think Ramen needs soup. If u want it witouth just call it pasta.
I just don't understand why are they surprised ramen has broth??😭 that's literally how it should be! and if you ask me that's nowhere near enough broth
Oh I’d whoop everyone’s ass ON GOD
maggii for liffee
im so dissapointed in that one girl she was really hyping up her ramen and im like yeah i agree you gotta season the ramen. But whatever the heck her ramen actually was? No no no no. You gotta COOK it.
Wait so do people not eat ramen with the broth that come with the soup bc it’s there for a reason 🤨
Why the fuck are they all so dry? like what the fuck where is the broth in any of these? this is sad lmao
"Oh well looks like we know who'll be eating ramen noodles like a broke college student tonight!"
Ist a tradition for me to watch this every month lol
cheetah girl be talkin the most shit when hers is the worst 😂
"I would prefer my ramen a bit more dry." girl we witnessed-
Can someone enlighten them that ramen is generally supposed to have some sort of liquid in it. Not so dry that you can pick up clumps of it in your hand and not too much that the noodles themselves are mushy.
y r they eating ramen w spoons
why is the cheeta gurl taking the role so farr
yalls expectations too high for ramen like😭
never let the other two near ramen again
WHERES THE BROTHHHHHHHH
the girl with the afro was so egotistical just for everyone to hate it lol
I think the cheetah girl misunderstood, they wanted ramen, not RAWmen
The cheetah girl is literally hating on everyone’s ramen for no reason and still acts like she is a five-star Michelin cook
Noodles with a spoon?
this feels so staged
how the hell did she turn ramen into croutons
I know they would HATE eachother..
0:45
Cheetah Girl just pissed my off lmao
Am I the only one who thought Cheyanne was Simone biles for a sec?
I had to skip the cheetah girl every time she came on my screen because she gives me second hand embarrassment
My favorite way to make ramen is to use chicken broth instead of water, add soy sauce, and chopped green onion. And I prefer the spicy chicken flavor.
Who the fuk eats Ramen with a spoon? Thats really pissing me off for some reason
its not so difficult to say that they were broke college kids, well maybe not cheyenne, she ate.
All of these looked bad ngl 😭😭
Imagine talking the most shit and your Ramen gets the lowest score. Lol😂
5:38 YEAH REAL DRY
Cheetah girl should taste her own before talking all that smack
Girl she told them to season her ramen because it ramen LIKE GURL COOK UR RAMEN BECAUSE ITS RAMEN
“the chicken is the only flavorful thing in here, flavor your ramen”  did you forget about the chicken flavor for ramen?😭😭😭😭
🥄
Nun of them looked good yall don’t know how to cook soup nd u got a whole pack of season u don’t gotta use ur nasty seasoning 😂
Cheetah girl perspective Marcus ramen: This is just dry so I’ll give it a three *Five minutes later* “This is wet, I prefer my noddles dry so a three.”
the cheetah girl is very annoying, i understand that she  has different seasonings but cmon u is NOT a professional cook
she literally love it but gave/give a 3, bruh💀💀
lesson learned? other peoples tastes are nasty lol
DEI 😂
Dude got fem vibes  Def zesty
Nahh I hope these people are okay because the 2 who were trying the one with broth/water said was weird like whatt your supposed to have wateerrrrr
Naaaah that shi was fancy ramen 😭 An ACTUAL broke college student ramen recipe would be 1-smash the noodles 2-add the included seasoning on top of the crunched pieces  3-eat it like crackers
Why cant people cook.
They all saying they dont like the water but its literally a soup ramen. U aint supposed to take the water out on this one
i could make better ramen in five minutes guys where are the vegetables and eggs and literally everything that makes ramen tasty 😭😭
People really eat their ramen dry? I've always eaten ramen as a soup.
Cheetah girl thinks her 💩 don't stink.
2:02 yeah better than yours
4:19   bro ate and left no crumbs
Sis is GORGEOUS, but as soon as she opened her mouth, I knew hers was gonna be the worst. It's always the way 😂
covid 19
Girl was criticizing mad hard but had the worst one 😭😭
The lack of broth is criminal
... Wh- why tf were they surprised that ramen has "water". Like she's literally the only one who got the memo
0:44 remen
As soon as cheetah girl started bragging about how "they wont even know her sauces" or whatever the hell she said i just knew the typa girl she was
Its called Ramen noodle soup, it supposed to have broth
"Being broke is whack af because you have to pay for parking". You aren't doing broke right. When you're taking the bus you'll understand.
Is ramen not soup???
of course they’re all black
Ok don't call me racist this is a genuine question. Black people don't like water in their ramen? Ramen is supposed to be watery its a soup. Unless im making a break i don't drain the water. Also shrimp is expensive she cheated
What bothers me is ramen is supposed to have the broth in it, that is the best damn part. I'm so tired of seeing this ramen, this is simply just noodles people, it has to have the broth!!!!!
Why is it that on each of these videos the person who’s always saying there’s is better then everybody else’s is always the worst
"I like my ramen a bit dry"  YOU HAVE THE WORST RAMEN IN THE WORLD, YOUR RAMEN IS SO CRUSTY THAT IT CAN BE GRABBED BY 2 FINGERS 🤌🤌, you got the best confident but the WORST ramen 😂😂 go rethink your life choices dummy
Olu girl- you so egotistical
do the other two not know the importance of broth in ramen???
4:21 she hyped up her ramen and it flopped and was dry ash   We know u like it dry gworl 😂😂
Idk why I can’t stand ramen/noodles without the broth they go so dry and cold quickly I love them when they are boiling hot and I can just slurp them up and they look so sad when they are dry😭
For broke college kids they are picky AF
It’s ramen…. It’s supposed to be salty it’s almost ALL SALT
Cheyenne is the only one who has ever had ramen before
It’s always the one that’s the most confident who does the worst🤣
THEY DID MY GIRL DIRRTY CRAY FISH IS DELICIOUS
im a nigerian, yeah miss olu whatever is perfect representation of us, loud mouthfull mfs
eating ramen and complaining about broth is crazy ITS A SOUP
Bro the ramen noodles are supposed to have broth, not dryy. The last girl actually did it right
"it has water in it" girl what-
The glasses be picky about ramen like damm bruh
Why the camera quality look like the Mexican breaking bad filter 😭
“i can literally pick this up with mah fĩņğėæeřş”
The Afro girl I don’t like
what even if i were a broke gal i would add maggi (salty liqued) and the noodles flavour packets without the spice then its a good noodles
Ramen is supposed to have broth bro 😭😭
How the hell do you make a soup dry?
"TO GIVE IT COLOR?" MA'AM SHE IS TRYING TO SURVIVE, NOT BE INSTAGRAM FAMOUS-
The title is insane😭😭😭😭
Why do they act so weird 😭 Cheyenne seemed like the only one who acted natural
she had mad confidence and was just bein straight up RUDE and look at hers..
2:45 I THOUGHT SHE LIKED DRY RAMEN
Isn't ramen supposed to be noodles and soup? Why are they complaining about water?
I feel like olu is being so judgy js so she can win 💀
all these look so bad
'are you tryna kill me..? æh....!' GiRL.......
the normal spicy pack of ramen is good why not just use that?
I HATE THE GIRL IN THE CHETTA PRINT
Damn did the girl in the cheetah print think she’d get more money or more clout if she acted that way lol
my ramen contains the chicken seasoning it comes with, garlic powder, lemon pepper, louisiana hot sauce and lemon juice so good.
Damn people where is your broth? The f****** broth is the best part of the f****** ramen
The cheetah shirt girl acting like she made the best thing ever when her ramen was clearly a brick
When you only have a limited of time of stove time that’s the second one
"i prefer my ramen a little bit dry" a little??
The second girl was talking all of that and hers was nasty
i hate everyone here
It’s supposed to have… soup..
WHO EATS RAMEN WITH A SPOON
Girl said it was salty then said it needed more seasoning💀
Aren´t they in college was with all that shrimp and chicken??? is it the college of life or what?
theyre so surprised seeing ramen being cooked like it was intended lmao 😂
where is the souppp WHERE IS THE SOUPPPPP 😭
she disgraced nigeria
girl with the cheeta print shirt got HUMBLED REAL BAD
Girl was confident about hers
2:25 that eye roll thou like girl have u SEEN your ramen?😂

So much disrespect.
Bro cheetah girl is KILLING me. What is she talking about, WHAT IS HER JUDGING A 3 AND 2 she's tryna make herself win.
a 3 is crazy
It's always the cocky ones who cooks the worst.
This is soggy ITS RAMEN
What song is ginger listening to, knodding her head like crackhead
Isn’t ramen suppose to be soupy?? Like it’s ramen..
AND WHY YALL USING A SPPON TO EAT NOODLES
Bro they was all hating asf
This whole video gives me anxiety- the spoons, the way y’all biting the ramen, the clumpy dry noodle chunks, the confusion at ramen being a soup, just all of it - last girl is really out here saving the day with shrimp and oyster sauce. Please, for the love of good ramen, somebody take Olu and Marcus to a real ramen shop   :,)
she was annoying the moment she opened her mouth im glad their trashed her food
i like mine with a lot of broth in my ramen i can’t stand fry ramen
the worst part is that theyre eating with spoons idc what glob of c*m shaped ramen theyre eating theyre eating with a fork
Repent❤
Cheetah print girl thinks she’s all that with her weird african spices that probably taste like dookie lol
cheetah girl got humbled real quick 😂😂marcus called hers dry and chey wasn’t having it 😂😂😂😂
"Look its a clump" Look its a dump
Nah hear me out Maruchin Beef with an extra flavor packet chalula and som tapatio 🔥🔥
I really hate they gave you all spoons to eat ramen
PLEASE CAN THIS WOMAN STOP WITH HER ATTAUGUGUGUUG AND CRAYFISH
They made the noodle 2hrs from before production and then microwaved it. Of course it's going to taste gross. Ramen only taste good fresh.
Olu really thought she was gonna eat the competition and over here with clumpy Ramen pls Add some time of liquid In there 😭
with all due respect, why're african women so rude
...ur supposed to boil noodles and ra,en is usually on the saktier side bc it has msg and sodium a lot.
These are not ramen ya’ll 😭😭😭 Those are pure shit like 😭😭 the last “ramen” was the closest to a ramen
Don't these people's ramen come with seasoning like.....😮‍💨
Why can a 10 year old make more appealing ramen than these 3. they all look like scraps from a garbage can
Y’all don’t use broth 😭😭😭
Tryna look professional so bad 😭
WTF IS RAMEN WITHOUT WATER!?
Then there's me just using the flavour packet it comes with. I'll drop a fried egg on top if I'm feeling fancy.
Why are they making ramen weird. Just make it like how it’s supposed to make. Does being broke also make you not able to follow instructions?
Marcus was so sweet with cheyennes
Why tf did they give them a SPOON to eat the ramen with??
im eating ramen rn n its exactly how cheyenne makes it 😭
im broke too but wtf r yall be cooking? let me teach yall how malaysians cook our ramen
Mayo in ramen....
Okay, cool ramen. But here is one superior: Chicken flavoured instant ramen Dark soy sauce  bacon strips Boiled eggs (boiled for around 5-7 minute, based on your preference) Flaky sea salt  Minced Garlic Sesame oil Chopped green onions You wont get better instructions than these, thats just how it is: Put the ramen with the seasoning package in a bowl, cover with 1/2 cup of boiling water, cover with a plate and let steep Fill a cup with the desired amount of garlic and green onions, this will be your aromatic oil Now cook your bacon strips untill crispy Pour the hot fat in the cup with aromatics, cover and let it sit for a while Now take a look at your delicious bowl of ramen and add in dark soy sauce, you can also add black pepper if you want Add in your bacon, the eggs that have been cut in half, and sprinkle some flaky salt on your eggs (just a bit) Uncover the aromatic oil and add in a bit of sesame oil (preferably toasted) Pour a bit of that liquid flavor in your bowl and have a nice meal NOTE: feel free to add anything, for example MSG if you'd like, I'll be glad if you sent a modified recipe in the replies
The only ok looking one was the last one 💀
The title did them dirty
why is it so DRY. 🌵🐪🦂🏜️🏝️🐫
all are 2 or less bro just leave it to the asians
Why did Olu compare hers to all of them, that's not how you judge something, and the fact that they all ended up hating hers to, lol!
if i was in this mfs would call me a chef
ts aint ramen 😭😭 and who tf eats ramen w a spoon..
Girl had the audacity to say it looks like mine and then say add flavour season it 😅
"Shout out to the shrimps who saved the day!"  Girl stfu we all know you got the lowest score. Nothing could save your dry ramen noodles 😒
All of the contestants are so annoying 🙄
Guys what all of these are just dry ass sad looking noodles. At least put broth in it
These people are giving college students a bad name…i’m sorry but all three of these look worse than just using the packet in the ramen mix, i know many people that could do better
Someone said they annoying and i thought how rude and then watched the video .Fuck they're annoying and why their ramen looking so inedible tho wheres the color?  also give them a fucking fork
What if these guys go to Japan and ask for their ramen without the broth ☠️☠️☠️
they're so mean lmaoooo wtf
I just noticed they’re all black couldn’t they find a white guy like bro
Why don’t they just use the spice pack
I just use the spice pack
What broke college student is buying shrimp?
Why are they all black
it's always the ones that talk the most smack that end up scoring the worst lmaooo
"Its watery" Bro... its supposed to be in broth....

ITS RAMEN, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE WET! THERE IS BROTH! BROTH!!!!!!
If you think ramen should be dry then you’ve never had actual ramen.. how can you be mad the ramen is in liquid? Ramen is literally made with stock and is full of it to the point you can’t see all the noodles or other ingredients in it except for the garnish
Where are they living that they dont know what broth is 😩
notice the color of their skin
Why are these psychos using spoons to eat raman?
You eat ramen with a fork😭 and the title is a little od like if someone called me a broke college kid they would not be on the earth another day
I make my ramen always with sriracha sauce soya sauce an egg and sometimes a little butter and the texture and taste is really good
Girl how you talk shit but your crusty ass ramen
the girl with the afro or whatever that isnt shouldnt be allowed back on the channel. She made me almost break my monitor.
(5:37) "I would prefer my ramen to be a little more dry" little is a HUGE understatement
Ramen chunks is crazy!
Oh my God, please teach your kids how to cook! How are they all so bad
Everyone who called leopard print cheetah print contributed to my stress today.
cheyenne or whatever was easily the best. i didn’t even try it but we all know that it is the best
eating ramen with a spoon?
eating ramen with spoon is wild...
Ahh hell nawwww bruh 😭🙏. Don’t even add to it and it’ll taste better than wherever that is 💀
all of these look horrible
Sazon packets g
It’s always the most judgmental mfka that make the nastiest food.   Why are you guys like this? I guarantee you she wouldn’t have even ate that shit
WHY IS THERE NO BROTH IN ANY OF THE DISHES OMG
Nah why they all black 😶‍🌫️
Last girl ate down good thing she won
Broke  college kids is just crazy
Do none of them know how to even make instant noodles? The cheetah girl’s ramen wasn’t even ramen it’s like a whole different dish.
“I would add (idk wtf she said) but yeah..” GIRL DINT ADD NONE OF YO SHIT IN THAT PLEASE💀😭
“Too watery” it’s ramen not chow mein
2nd girl prolly thought she was competing with white people 😂
Chetta girl strgulling to say its good make me rolling on the floor
Sup
Im sad that you need to worry about food in collage in the number 1 economy in the world
5:26 crazy to say that right after what she cooked up
Oluy got Tism or something tf is wrong wit her
These people don’t know how to make/ know what ramen is at all. Re do this with people who know how to make it
Why were they so hesitant to compliment the last girls ramen😭😭😭
no fare I want to see all the reactions.
“I don’t like all the water…” ITS RAMEN
I don't like the water 🫣..... I wouldn't feed their cooking to stray dogs
Damn watching videos like these made me realise I am not picky at all. Like y'all stop being babies just take a bite and try it phahsah
Cheetah girl got on my nerves, how tf u gonna say his was dry but then for the other girl u said u like urs dry? 😐
The guy and cheetah lady didn’t even make ramen. They made flavored noodles.
Yh the girl with the braids high five literally does no one know how to make ramen edible girl but some water some sauce seasoning and like broth or something girl dry ramen wtf bro area trying to to kill yourself that’s just pure sadness
Ramen is supposed to have broth??? What is going on?
Me knowing I woulda killed this soup challenge with my slim Jim ruffle pickle Tabasco brick 🤦🏽
The guy is pissing me off jeez
the cheetah print girl is kinda annoying like ramen is supposed be “watery” its broth and if u were to eat it dry that aint ramen is dried noodles
when your dad forgot to get the milk did he forget to get the water too?
"Are you trying to kill me?😭" Girlie, if those two take another bite of your ramen, they would be hospitalized.
Cheetah girl is so annoying oml
Cheetah girl is so annoying.
cheetah print girl: i would make it a lil red RED RAMEN HUH..
The clumps of ramen almost made me throw up😭
The best ramen to me is just a simple pack of ramen I prefer shin black instant ramen but idk if that’s expensive to broke people I just add corn eggs sesame seeds and some cloves and it’s good
do people like ramen without broth now?
Eww
Bruh that girl with the Afro annoying mad dumb
Miss cat print cannot stop talking about herself....
Wsg yall I'm back againa year later, I'm a girl now, that first lady is still annoying LMFAO
third girl yapped so much yet got the lowest rating 😂
First she complained about the salt and the she said the chicken was the only thing with flavuor lol
“The ramen’s a bit watery” my guy it’s soup
Cheetah Print girl was so confident
Always the rude egotistic people lose the cheetah print girl was rude
what the fuck did i just watch, how are these people calling their dishes RAMEN
I’m late to the party, but this is the way to go. One can of vegetable beef soup, one pack of ramen noodles in a pot. If you’re feeling up for it, crack an egg in there.
As a Asian I am offended by them😢
She first said it was too salty but then complained that the ramen didn’t have any seasoning (fake cheetah girl)
Olu talks the most shit but she don't even know how to make ramen she calls it "watery" when that's what you call broth it's supposed to be in there😭
Olu said, “ I like my Raman a little bit dry.” Girl a little bit as in a LOTTTT!!!😥☝️😵
5:13.....kali muscle would be proud of this lady......he made ramen noodle kind similar to this once in a prison cell youtube video.....😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:33.... 😂😂😂....shout down what!!!!!.......im glad there was no hair....🤣🤣🤣
Ramen is supposed to have water it’s literally a soup😭😭😭
i think the worst thing you can do is take away someone's ability to cook. or practice how to. colleges dont have access to these things on campus. yet youre living away from home for 4+ years. It's horrible to think about actually. Unless youre a cooking major lol
Olu has an ego so high like omg-
I didn’t like the olu girl she was lowkey annoying
Please I speak for all Nigerians when I say the curly haired girl's style of cooking noodles is not okay.
Bruh these ppl really out here tryna make ramen a 5 🌟 restruant ramen and i just put water cheese slice and hotsauce in with the occasional raw egg
"it's got water" that's called the broth. it's kind of a defining factor of ramen 🙄
As soon as the last contestant stated her ingredients I started nodding my head. I even paused it to type this lmao. She better win
The young lady with the braids is the only one that knows Ramen is a soup and looks edible I think the other 2 think they're making a pasta dish lollollol bless their heart lollollol
that aint ramen its just noodles
they call it ramen but there's no broth???
"you have to pay for parking" girl??? you call yourself broke when you have a car???
First off, even ramen being eaten with forks is reaching, so them using spoons is pure fatality. Second off, ramen is called ramen noodle soup, all of their ramens were dry af, not even pasta is so dry😭😭
you hired the college students who cant cook the girl with the afro literally made dry ramen. she must like the taste of saw dust
The third girl food look decent but overall all of them look dry asf and the Jamaican girl really thought she was gon win her was the worst period.
“Broke college kids” is wild *ADULT COLLEGE STUDENTS*
Gurl saying ""i like my a little bit more better "" like what she said*+*next round shit js got roasted by 2 of them 😂😂
3:08 and 3:22 together BYE
i rlly wanted to see everyones reactions to the scores lmfaoo
Why is that girl complaining about budget ramen so much...
i can cook better noodles then all of them with indomie
imagine not being able to cook ramen normally 💀
who the fuck eats dry ramen
You can tell the lady w the afro loved the shrimp ramen and didnt wanna say anything because of her ego. The way she talked up hers to get it tanked in the ratings is crazy.
Haiya!
Thank God The ice spice girl got her ahh humbled
Its always the one who complains the most about everyone else's food who's sucks all around 🤣
Dry Ramon is a CRIME, the broth is always the best part
It is weird
The girl wearing print is Nigerian and her ramen is dry like block😂😂😂
Cheetah print girl is passing me off
it's always the mean people that doesn't win lmao
Imagine saying mine is def going to win then getting a two
Bro what’s so funny is how the cheetah print person said “I prefer my ramen more dry” that’s not what ramen is💀💀
It’s salty are you trying to kill me 🥺👉👈
The one who made the Jamaican ramen was so confident
I feel like if I was a broke collage student I wouldn’t worry if my ramen looked appetizing and colorful
They all got me fucked up
The cheeta girl is honestly a disgrace to Nigerians she was criticizing others mean while hers was the worst 😡
I am a Nigerian and I don't use crayfish in my ramen 😢😢
Where is the broth
nigerian girl had it coming and the spoon is wild
“It has no color” GIRL HAVE YOU SEEN YOURS.. 💀
Only 1 can be classified as broke
cheetah girl is way too pretty to be acting like that oml
The cheetah print girl was a lil too confident that she was winning
The fact that this video was filmed before the buldak era
I laughed so hard when i saw the cheetah girl ramen it. Try as hell
When you make ramen, you gotta eat it right away. If it sits for any length of time, it continues to cook and the texture changes.
C
Ramen is a noodle with broth ….
Eat it with a fork,
I had no idea that it is possible to make ramen look that bad. even when trying to make it look as plain and bad as possible.. i didnt expect result like that 😂
Why are they all black?😂😂😂.... black people, broke people??
I don’t know why people like DRY ramen 💀 it’s originally with soup
Y’all don’t eat raw noodles,i would be starving and i see a pack of noodles i be eating that shi like i was dying
Annoying
0:00  ewww heh
Marcus saying Chayenne’s looks like it’s from the street tells me he has never had real ramen before. Bro has never read instant noodle’s package instructions either
Thw one eho talks the !ost shit is the worst and i knew from when she started talking that it was gon be booboo
cheetah print girl thought they was gonna LOVE her ramen and they HATE it. LOOOL
he really said dis shii look dry asl😂😂😂😂😂
Black people don’t typically have lots of the broth in their instant noodles, that’s probably why she mentioned that it was “watery”
Why did cheetah girl say the guys Raman was dry I thought she said she liked dry tf she pissed me off the whole time
I HATE OLU SO MUCH LIKE BRUH WE CAN TELL U LIKE UR RAMEN DRY AND ALSO UR NOT QUIRKY "spices they never heard of before" OK THEN BUD.
As an asian person… the dry ass noodle that cheeta girl presented was a hate crime
Ramen is Japanese 😂
Cheyenne was raised right and she can cook 😍 the other girl also made Cheyenne look so much better. Ramen is usually a soup unless you make stir fried ramen so they’re crazy
2:46 if his is dry what is hers..
ngl I like ramen without the broth so basically noodles, but she don’ gotta say that it’s weird. but cheetah girl, humble your embarrassed ass.
I don't mean to be a hater but all of them was talking shit and all of their ramen was ass
Cheyennes had looked good
It's my first time, seeing people eating dry ramen noodles...Why not just go for regular pasta noodles then?
I see.... SPOON 🥄 AAAAAA
that aint ramen thats NOODLES.. also second girl WOW you have the guts to say yours is the best while the other two admits its the worst
I'm keen on Japanese style ramen. The soup is everything.
they all look kinda bad
Idk they totally missed the point of being "broke" and started being very rude and naggy
Ramen is supposed to have a broth. 😂
“tHe rAMEn MATTers”
the nicest ppl always win...
umm isn’t Ramen meant to be watery all of these were a bit dry and look bland
I CANT BE  THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THAT GIRL ON THE COVER OF THIS VIDEO LOOKS LIKE THAT DHAR MANN ACTER
"The ramen 's a bit watery". Japanese make harakiri as their beloved ramen become lo mien!
Bro ramen is supposed to be “watery” it’s noodles in broth (to be fair I also don’t eat it with the broth but that dryness is a whole other level”
Being Asian I feel insulted by these ramen dishes
These poor students are complaining it's watery?  Do they know ramen is a soup?
At least a plastic fork💀
The girl with the cheetah print is judging so hard but hers is the worst one 💀
6:24 WDYM ITS WATERY ITS BROTH
can’t you just bring ramen from home before going to college,and just add hot water and that’s it like jsut eating it normal with hot water,and the season packet and that’s it
0:09 i cant tell if she's speakin english or arabic
They dont know what broth is💀
So what i took from this is.... two of them dont understand that ramen has broth. Not dry noodles....
Complains about the first guy’s ramen being dry but then says she prefers dry ramen, what are we doing here?!
Cheyenne is the only good one, made it right and everythin
Bro two of these weren't even ramen and there's no way I have to elaborate further. Ramen is a SOUP. If your noodles don't swim in a liquid that shit ain't ramen. Also, you'll get hungry REAL quick with just that dry ass bowl. The liquid is what actually fills you up instead of TRICKING your stomach to be full. Ever wondered why after certain dishes you get hungry fast again after a short while even though you thought it was a lot? That's why.
What level of struggle is dry ramen?! You can’t be too poor for the water it was cooked in😤
Wtf is this all of there’s looked dry or colorless and don’t get me started how tasteless they looked atleast Cheyenne was being nice and like made it look like ramen (despite it being colorless) i am really disappointed
do black people not realize ramen is a soup....
Cheetah print girl pissing me off Fr she just said it was too salty and then she said season it more? Like girl stop lying we know you can’t afford those ‘Nigerian spices’ like okay
Are they allergic to putting BROTH in RAMEN
all three of the ramens look wrong, as someone who eats authentic Japanese ramen very often and has seen documentaries about it; no broth, noodles not wet enough (ramen is literally noodles in a massive bowl of broth soup), it often includes things like spring onion, seaweed, greens, an egg, bamboo shoots, spice (if oyu want it hot), and then meat, veg or seafood. The broth is the part that instant ramen cannot do properly...broth takes days. IMO the last one was the only one even CLOSE to Ramen...becuse it had oriental flavours.
They should try my ramen recipe A dash of old bay and garlic powder with mozzerela cheese and the full pack of beef flavor with a little bit of water and some beef jerky or fish balls.
I’m gonna be honest all of these look bad lmao, I just eat my ramen with the seasoning pack and water, what’s wrong with water
Is weird that they expect the Ramen to be… dry. Anyways, I think they’re is plenty of cheap creative ways of eating it, aside of just adding “spices and condiments” to everything.
The fact there using a spoon to eat it and the noodles has no water and it looks so dry!   Edit: the last girl made her ramen the best
Soon as i seen the spoons i went to the next video.
idk why they so picky when they all made C R A P ramen 😭😭😭😭😭😭
dry ass noodles 😭
its almost like they've never had actual ramen before
It’s literally supposed to be to be wet
W- DID THEY CUT UP THE DAM RAMEN? WHO DOES THAT
Nahh broke college students is crazy
The Nigerian girl went there to fall hand. You added crayfish to undercooked Ramen??? You no sabi cook for house?? Why was your noodle dry and clumpy? Geez. Also why is there a single shrimp in the other girls ramen and its swimming in water?
Bruh the water is the broth talking about a tsunami 🧠⚡
So are we watching this I saw that they said remen not ramen so many times they're eating with spoons and Le s be honest they should have gotten something better
And she said his ramen was bad?
I expect all of it to be nasty by the way y’all had it sitting out. You got 2-5 to start eating your noodles before they start to absorb the soup & get soggy
No way cheeta girl was complaining that INSTANT ramen was salty.
do these kids not know shit abt ramen😭😭😭
If you are hungry and broke you will eat anything.
5:39 yeah we know you like your ramen dry. Sahara dessert dry.
Cheetah girl is a hater fr😭
Broke college kids? This is foolishness.
i feel like this channel gives money to the winner of these challenges because there's no other explanation as to why they puposefully try to reduce the other people's rating. I mean they literally liked the last one but then realizing it might win, they tried to take it back by finding fault that didn't exist.
Those two were doing too much, I loved the girl in the ponytail.  ''I like my ramen a little bit more...dry'' Yeah, we noticed ''There's not enough shrimp'' The fact thet there's shrimp in it is already too enough There's different types of ramen, and judging by how nasty their's looked, that's the soupy kind.
Why is all their ramen so dry? They all looked disgusting. I don't drain the water from my ramen when i finish cooking it... am i doing something wrong or something? Is everyone else draining their ramen?
The water is BROTH. Like since when did ramen not have any broth in it? Whack
The cheetah girl.... Pissed me off...... Like I was about to jump on the screen and jump at her
bruh all of them dont know any thing about ramen this is just shit  the last one looked good and ok ok but that both idk how they eating it  i wanna invite them and let thme taste japan ramen
i love how hard they are beefing with each other even though all of their noodles are kinda bad lol.
This has to be a prank
The girl w the cheetah prints had the audacity to say "Yeah this is just dry" LIKE GURL YOUR RAMEN WAS EVEN MORE DRY
“My ramen is different”  Honey, your ramen is a culinary CRIME. 😭😭😭😭   P.S the two contestants complaining about how that one girl’s ramen was too “wet” and has “too much water” has clearly NEVER eaten a bowl of authentic ramen. Cause they can’t be fr preferring a soup dish, DRY
bro why the last girl the only one who made it right.why don't the other people put water in it bro
This is not ramen, this is black people food
Olu didnt make Ramen she made it Raw Man
this has to be ragebait
Never liked dry ramen. Why you didn't give it a soup? The packet is soup and is included for a reason.
For my Ramen, I like to drain the water, add butter, touch of mayo, and some cheese. Then add mixed veggies or broccoli with the seasoning packet. Fried egg on top never hurts.  The dairies make it creamy. Might sound gross but it's really tasty and silky creamy.
Olu has the biggest ego rating all of them bad and she got karma💀
Bro, the cheetah girl's ramen looks dryer than the worst jokes.
so are all broke college kids black?
THE AUDACITY SHE HAD TO SAY THIS 2:47 “It’s dry”  MISS GIRL YOURS WAS LITERALLY CHUNKS IF DRY RAMEN AND WATER
olu was a lot mean she could have calmed herself
The fact I’m not a collage student I’m in fact a middle schooler 13 years old I could make ramen better than this with like just a regular pack of Maruchan Instant Ramen ( $3.68 12 pack at Walmart  )boil in water and the seasoning packet in the ramen add a spoon of Lao Gan Ma Fried chili oil ( $3.88 at Walmart ) after boil. If there is a needed protein add chicken breast ( John Soules Foods Fully Cooked All Natural Fresh Flame Grilled Chicken Breast Strips at Walmart for $2.89 )  or any protein you want. all you need to do is pop it in the microwave or read the instructions on the back then just add in the chicken. You can also get a small pack of eggs ( from Walmart $1.08 for a six pack ) boil like 1 or 2 and add that to your ramen and this might be a lot but it’s pretty simple and the eggs can sit you don’t have to use all the boiled ones right away so next time you eat ramen u have an egg but Yk don’t let it sit too long. Anyway simple ramen for $12.25 for all the ingredients plus extra. I think these are some lazy student but whatever. There it’s not that hard and this ramen is so good! 🍜
RAMEN LIVES MATTER
Funny thing is that my bro currently goes to ucr
5:17 I miss sriracha :(
damn yall gotta try my ramen fr
6:48:girl shut up and eat the meal
This Cheetah girl was projecting so hard 💀
the audacity the cheetah girl had, then when hers was CRUNCHY HAAHAHHAHAH I DIED🤣🤦🏽‍♀️
“I like mines a little more DRY” Yhea no 💩 Sherlock 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂 All of thier Ramen noodles looked horrible 😂.
It's not supposed to be fry and why y'all eating with a spoon
Hi my name is oluwowoyameyoluawowayoya😊 Hi my names Marcus😐
Yea Ramen is supposed to have broth, and looks like she has the correct amount, enough to keep noodles moist but it was not drowning. For color i would've added green onions or cilantro. Also for color i do add about 1/2 to 3/4 of the seasoning packet while cooking and add the rest after you served and mix. I also add egg and the meat that it is flavored(except chili flavor i usually ass beef to that). Trust ramen you can experiment but make sure you have broth otherwise it isnt ramen.
Okay okay let me give some real advice about making decent broke ramen:  If you have at least a mini fridge/freezer, get some eggs, get a package of sliced ham, and a frozen bag of mixed veggies. If you're just cooking for you these should last several meals. Boil the eggs with salt for 7-8 minutes then put in ice water for perfect jammy medium eggs. Then boil some water for the noodles and while cooking them add the frozen vegetables. Take 1-2 slices of ham and slice it extra into bite size strips. Then once the noodles n veggies are boiled, add the seasoning, boiled eggs n ham. Maybe add sriracha if you want extra spice. Enjoy.
she said she likes her ramen dry. She really showed that with her dish😂😢
Indomie is the best with a fried egg on top now that’s ramen! Also I would boil and egg and add some pork belly and seasoning to the boiled water to make a soup. Those are the proper ways to make it! Just sayin 🤷🏾‍♀️
I LOVE ramen! The only time I don't include lots of broth is when I put barbeque sauce in it (idk if anyone else does it) but I LOVE my ramen with broth and barbeque sauce
i LOVE in these videos when someone talks shit about other peoples food and acts like theirs is the best, and then its gets rated really low.
"i would prefer something dry" we can tell
The dude be shading the ramen (that was actually prepared right) without even tasting it, no its not a tsunami, that's how ramen is supposed to be, u uncultured swine
I knew from the way the cheetah print girl was taking she was finna have the WOSRT  meal And she did not disappoint!
Cheetah print is such a tryhard. Its noodles bro. Its not eye fillet💀
I knew that girl with the fros ramen would be bad she was talking all that hot shit😂😂😂😂
Leave ramen to the Asians. Yall cant get it right. Even as a "struggle" meal, there's so many ways to elevate it.
2 contestants don’t know ramen is a damn soup….only one actually made ramen 🍜
They all look bad tbh
Who the hell out here eating ramen without the broth!!??😱 The broth is literally what gives the noddles so much flavor. They are mad frfr😂
cheetah girl talkin all that shit but her ramen look like that
nah id win
cheetah print girl was talkin shit when her noodles were more intact than conjoined twins
5:30 lil bro said its nasty when his was some shit 😭
There's not enough shrimp!! That's the point its broke kids food video 🪚🫠
Cheetah girl really thinking she better than everyone else with her different 'vibe' of noodle like bffr
The cheetah print girl recipe sounds gross she got her nerve.. .
Ramen is meant to have water….
my Ram-in WTF who says that shit like that :D  (side note just realized this channels a wannabe jubilee and or buzzfeed :D they started these weird ass try each others BS trends.
If we being honest none of this looks good..
Ramen is supposed to have broth?!
no way its nixstah 0:35
I’m so happy that olu got humbled 😭 she was talking shit the entire vid fr
Nah this pissed me off lol
How do people not know that Ramen is NOT noodles!!! RAMEN ALWAYS HAS SOUP WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE LIVING???
Miss cocky over here had that worst one lol
You can tell by their attitude who’s the worst
The cheetah girl makes me mad
Yeah that last girl ate it up the other ones just never seen ramen before though 😂
You know when you talk the most S*it others food, your food  about to be horrendous 😂
All of em look nasty. Lmao 😂
yall eatin with spoons tho lol all bad
She literly said i like to smell it to make sure i am not eating something bad😢
As an Asian and black woman I like my ramen traditional with the broth but I still add my flair to make it a lil hood too. U gotta keep some things traditional like ramen. It’s not good without the broth. No one wants some dry ramen 🤢 .. u can still add ur spice but don’t jus throw away the broth 😂
Why its so dry💀
no asian people!?????? in a RAMEn competition... we knew it was gonna be bad from the start
“It’s salty” nobody ever tell her what a sodium bomb ramen is lmao
The most cocky one always makes the worst food
As an Asian, you all disappoint me 😢
3 years late but seriously why do people not realize Ramen is soup? It's supposed to have water in it it's called broth
“It’s salty” girl. Do yk what ramen is? 😭😭 Bffr
Why would you give them a spoon? Why are they acting like this needs to be some amazing dish when they're broke? You know this video is probably from those buzzfeed guys
"i like my ramen a little bit more dry" not a little bit gurl WE CAN TELL THAT YOU LIKE IT CRUNCHY
5:40 oh we know girl 😭
She said oluvuevueunembwemunutbwenwem osas
As a small autistic child back in like 2006 i just used to do like a third or half of the water. Boil the noodles with the flavor in the water from the start so the noodles soaked up flavor while cookin. Then drain water. Boom. Non plain ass noodles but with taste. If my 6yo ass could figure it out then so could he.
Meanest: 3rd place Chillest: 2nd place Nicest: 1st place  Balanced. Perfect.
did the guy said i hate ramen with soup in it bruh get some noodles packet with seasoning
Slaves finding out we can use water in cooking and its not terrible
Cheyenne is my favorite she’s literally sweet wet it while the other girl got this weird attitude
There’s supposed to be water in ramen😭😭😭
i dont think anyone here knows what ramen is lol they prefer dry noodles
Yo why the Raman look so dry tho
Yoooooo I just realized who the girl in black reminds me YNW Melly.
trash talkers never fail us
“Noodles look dead” GIRL YOUR NOODLES LOOK LIKE IT HASN’T ATE FOR A YEAR😭
The thumbnail😂
I’m not impressed because the 1st and 2nd don’t even know what ramen is. Cheyenne is the only one who can cook it right. Oluwamayowa’s ramen looked like tumbleweed and she was the one who was most confident lol. Marcus’ ramen was again, dry as hell. Cheyenne’s may not taste good but at least it’s correct. Also, the fact that they called the broth water is disappointing and hilarious.
the spoons are stupid a f
Nah Olu said the ramens watery!?!? Isn’t that what it’s supposed to be
lol @ my name is Marcus.
She said “I prefer my ramen dry” 😂😂😂😂 WE KNOW!!!! so dry it wasn’t cooked
Dry ass ramen.
All 3 look trash
Ramen is a soup not dry noodles😭
WTF do y'all find these numptys who cant cook? 😅
Typical Nigerian 🤣 full of themselves ALWAYS
Do... you guys even know what ramen IS?
5:38 girl that aint water thats soup
lol a 000000
lol i love thisssss😂😂😂😂
Cheetah girl so boldly gave everyone else nothing above a 3 while her dry ass ramen got a 2 from one person and a ZERO from another 💀😭
this is js a cheap ramen w things that YOu have/can get for a low price. js sum ingredients for how I like my ramen, but don't listen to my broke ass </3  ramen 12 pack ($3) soy sauce (4-8 bucks depending on where you get it, but some of the cheap ones r good yet the others r not. don't get fooled luvs) minced garlic in a jar < mincing garlic yourself- $1 (it's cheaper to get the garlic as it is, just so you don't waste money on a couple of garlics in a jar even tho u js using it for a couple of meals.) seasoning cubes-$2 (LIFE CHANGER. it fr tastes good most of the times depending on which flavor you get. for me, chicken is the best one since you could deffo taste all the flavor packed inside of it.) controversial, but great value seasonings r an easy price and good if you use your cards right when cooking. ik this ain't a full ass meal but this is js ideas on what to get for cheap. but reminder for y'all, most people can get all this sh and yet it still taste horrible. at least learn how to use yo seasonings right so it tastes good ig  💀
Ramen is meant to be brothy not dry that brings the good taste 😂
I skipped through probs most of the video and it literally was just sad to watch. that aint ramen. that‘s just noodles. except for the last girl maybe cuz she actually had broth in there. atp i could’ve won this cuz mine‘s actually ramen with broth like wth
Why are they asking for more shrimp when they are broke college students 💀
That olyamo or whatever girl be getting on my nerves 😭😭
I get they don’t use the broth for theirs. (I don’t, too. Sometimes.) But the broth is part of the ramen.
First of all WHERE IS THE BROTH?! And secondly, WHYJust WHY are yall eating it with a spoon n
why do they all look disgusting
the girl in the cheetah shirt piss me off
Indomie ramen is meant to not have a broth but other than that I have never seen ramen without the soup 😂
6:17 girl thats what its supposed to look like😭she pissed me off she was way too confident
bro who gave them spoons
Shake saace
Rematch my boy Marcus needs redemption
I know I cook good😩😩🔥
They don’t know HOW TOOO
Why are all of them Black and they’re broke wtf💀💀💀💀💀 racist ass mcs
What season ramen? It already has seasoning
Oul had the worst ramen of all time lol😂
at least get an asian student.....they know HOW TO MAKE GOOD RAMEN
WHY THE FUCK THEY EATING WITH A SPOON 😊
This video had to be a joke😭
Ramen is suppposed to be “watery” like a broth type. It’s ramen 💀
aint no way they are calling it "watery" when it is literally just the soup
olu was trash talking everyone but hers looked like it was made by a group of middle schoolers messing around mixing school food together
that girl with the dry ramen needs to be humbled ;-;
Olu represented Nigeria but we are disappointed
People keep complaining about the ramen being in broth, its supposed to be in broth.. if you like it dry then you are not eating a ramen, you are eating a mazemen.. Mazemen is a brothless ramen..  please learn the difference and cook on!
How do people not know the difference between noodles and ramen this is NOT RAMEN cause there is no ramen SOUP you eat ramen with SOUP
How does one UNDERCOOK ramen? Shit gets soft in a matter of 3 minutes like??
My favourite ramen is the cheap Sapporo ichiban ramen with seaweed, onion and imitation crab sticks. (That would be on a good day)
These college students can’t even cook ramen.
the bitch in the cheetah print  is the most annoying person ever she js glazes her own ramen the whole time😭
Hear me out yeah. I'm Nigerian, and noodles (specifically Indomie noodles with just the powder spice packet and oil) with crayfish actually bangs.  Butttt this lady def did not make it properly. Her food looks crusty and I would not eat that.  With that said, don't knock it till you try it.
The cheetah print one. Never cook again. Do your family a favour 😂
yalls can say what u want but i love olu and how confident she is. she isn't mean just brutally honest
ramen has broth, what 2 of them made, were dry noodles, those also taste good, but its not ramen.
its always the girls that talk the most shit that have the worst food lmao
the way that dude said "maruchan" just made me cringe like who says it like that? "muh ru chin" its MAR OO CHAWN
Why don’t none of them have broth in their ramen that’s the best part in the end😭😭
too much water in ramen??? bitch its literally noodle soup tf do you mean too much water??? its supposed to make SOUP
The last girl is the only one that knows how to cook ramen
M
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon? How hard is it to buy a fork.
nobody putting hot sauce in theirs
The girl with the Afro is so annoying smh like shut up you made disgusting ramen that doesn’t mean you have to throw a little hissy fit lmao, that shrimp ramen definitely was not grey
Cheetah girl was humbled real quick 😂 💯
They don't know how to Ramen. My Asian blood is boiling. I know a lot of high school students who can do better
"i dont like all the water" BRO THATS THE GOOD SHIT AND ITS CALLED BROTH
Spice don’t mean flavor
Where are the forks
uhm.. i know of different styles of ramen but i thought it actually is with broth.. it’s a noodle soup right? if it was me i’d definitely use a broth/bouillon cube, mayo, chili flakes and an egg. those are available in my dorm before, cheap and basic ones i’d have at lease.
Whew I just know they came to the comments and were like shocked, shocked because they thought they could  good to bring that to a set like to a production set
it's not "watery" it's sitting in its broth????
do they even know how to make ramen 😭
BRO- ITS BROTH ITS GOOD ITS YUMMY
Indomie will beat any one of these ramens 😂😂😂
i crush my ramen really good pour it in the bowl add water a cap full of grape seed oil and microwave it for 4 minutes soo good quick and simple plus when you crush it up it makes it look like a lot so it tricks your brain into getting full off one pack instead of having to eat two works for me anyway
Olu giving mean girl energy 🥴
It’s not water it’s broth retard
Remin?
Where's the soup?????? like i see the noodles but this is giving "CAN'T COOK" vibes.
Fellas, it’s instant ramen. It’s cheap and easy pasta with a lot of salt. It’s not that serious 😭
Bro none of them even knows how to make ramen like what is that 😭
why are they eating it with spoons 😭
Their "ramens" are drier than the Sahara Desert
They way they all act is spelled C-U-N-T
WHY DO NONE OF THEM LIKE WATERY RAMEN THATS THE POINT OF RAMEN..
never let them cook again bruh
wouldn't it be easier to use forks or chopsticks to eat rather than spoons?
MY FIRST INSTINCT IS TO SMELL IT MY FIRST INSTINCT TO YOUR RAMEN IS TOO COOK IT
Y'all doing a disservice to real Ramen. Y'all just eating noodles.  Real ramen has BROTH! And a sign it taste good and yummy is to suck/surp them up. Y'all just eating noodles, at this point. Also you can over cook/boil the noodles... and undercook... look up some JAPANESE RAMEN vidoes up.
I remember when having white people in videos wasn't seen as racist.
Something about olu saying the food was simultaneously too flavorful and not flavorful enough told me she was gonna lose
Cheetah print how you start off saying it’s salty then say it’s unseasoned
People are complaining about how these students prepare their noodles when this channel literally states it’s targeted toward Black culture. Many black people eat their ramen w/o broth or water. That’s a known fact. stfu and go to a Japanese channel geared toward cuisine if you want to nit pick
They don't even know what broke is 😂
LoW kEy bruh lOw kEy
Girl was calling the first one dry meanwhile hers has chunks of uncooked noodles💀💀
Seeing COLLEGE students  not knowing how to boil noodels make me question what even happend
Do people not understand that Ramen is technically more of a soup dish…..so why they acting shocked there’s liquid chicken broth in the ramen? Also they gotta stop adding all that weird shit and different spices….like just add the seasoning packet, make sure the noodles aren’t over or under cooked and you will have the best ramen lmfao
"aDd MoRe ShRiMp" bro.... the title says broke smh what a buffoon
Im a 25 year old broke because of the cost of living crisis, all I eat is ramen, honestly think I would kill this challenge
It’s salty are you trying to kill me       Girl it’s ramen it’s meant to be salty
The girl with the Afro doing 2 much😭😭
The girl with the braids was so nice
Cheetah girl was talking so much about her ramen I thought she made a 5 star ramen.Bye i wouldnt even eat that by the looks.
I bet the ramen wouldn’t matter if I snatched olu wig off her head…😂
Its so salt like are you trying to KiLl mE
Why yall eating ramen with spoons 😅😅
With all the ramen hacks online, there's no excuse to be making bad ramen even if you're on a budget.
BRUH I LITERALLY HATE THE LEOPARD PRINT GIRL SM SHE DIDNT HAVE TO BE SO MEAN LMAO
pls do not let the girl that cant properly boil noodles become a neuroscientist
White and black people can bond over the fact they like their Ramen with no broth...spaghetti they like spaghetti.
someone needa humble oluwamayowa fr
Did they throw the broth out?
Wtf do they think ramen is just coz u broke dont mean u gotta be incompetent with a kettle
Anybody from tiktok😂
What the fuck are these cretins!? What kind of shit-stuffed frog guts did they make!? Disgusting.
what did i just watch
Have none of these people had real ramen??? Look, easy, mood the Soy Sauce and Pork flavored Maruchan, add a sunny side up egg, (rehydrated) dehydrated wood ear mushrooms, and green onions. Simple, super cheap, delicious.
"the ramen has water in it" ITS SUPPOSED TO TF
It's always the most overconfident one's with the most pretentious dishes that end up getting the lowest score.
"Being a broke student sucks, you have to pay for parking..." stop right there, get this actors outa here. Only person I can trust is actually really broke was that dude. I know for a fact he aint getting no help from his girl in collage
why is it always black people
I hate the the girl with the cheetah print like girl you know dang well you was doing way too munch she actin real bougie even though you on a Youtube video that say broke college kids try each other's ramen like at least show a lil bit of respect
I'm sorry (not really) but his hair is giving the dreads from Temu
That ramen look dry
HOW DO YOU NOT ADD BOTH TO RAMEN WHY WOULD YOU EAT IT DRY LIKE THAT WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Painful watch.
People who wanted to see their reactions to their scores Especially cheetah girl😂
you people who eat ramen without broth are animals
Now it's like prison Raman
This is pretty irrelevant to the video, but don’t a majority of 4 year American Universities have meal plans for the commissary?? When I was in college almost everyone would just eat there😐For the legit lower income students, some would work in the commissary as a way get free meals. Compared to buying groceries every week it’s much cheaper, and the quality is still the same(not great but the same). The whole broke college student only eating scrappy food stereotype seems like it died in the early 2000’s lol. Like yes they’re still broke, but I feel like people act like it’s impossible to get accessible food in college and that ramen is a necessity 🙄
These are unofficial college students, like bruh who tf do you not know what broth is?
Then thinking broth is weird in ramen is so beyond me 😭
I highly doubt these three Caucasian Valley girls ever ate or seen Ramen before this video.
Please redo this and find people who know what actual ramen is. This is more pasta than noodles.
CHEETAH GIRL ACTING LIKE HERS IS LOOKING GOOD
Dis Cheetah girl say it was salty then turned around and said it has no flavor?
the complaints about the broth are disappointing :( ramen usually has broth
#1  n it's not "water" lmao it's broth! Add a bullion cube if yu need more sPiCe...?spice... it's ramen. Stop.
Why do none of them keep the broth in?
Wheres the broth ?
I love the girl with hoops shes so cute🥰
buzzfeed fake lol
i hate the two people, why they hating so much
Cheetah girl (yes, I stole the name from another comment lmao) acted like she was the Gordon Ramsay of Ramen.
"i dont like all the water" IN RAMEN???
im 11 and i can make better..
Bro do people know what ramen are? Marcus and olu are too confident. Ramen is supposed to have BROTH. Maruchan is supposed to be a BROTH type. Olu talking about colours while her ramen are clumpy.
They're broke (deprived of intelligence not money)
Did they never eat ramen before?  I eat my ramen from the cup ( just eat like shin ramen bro)
"my momma tell me that if i dont haven nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all" crunchy ramen girl could learn something
its the way i thought the girl with the cheetah print ramen was gonna be the shit based off the way she was speaking on the other peoples but CLEARY shes the one who cant make ramen... over there eating saltine bricks
olu is so insufferable why would you ruin the good ramen with that cRayFisH just because that dry fishy flavour would ruin almost every west african dish doesnt mean you have to bring that flavour into other dishes as well and then be so arrogant about it not even knowing that ramen is supposed be in a broth?? but what to expect from a girl that uses the very same spice for every fckn meal. its like ma'am do you see me using chili flakes in a mushroom risotto ?? variety man, different dishes call for different spices...
Do people not eat ramen as a soup here?
you can clearly tell there are self biases to give their competitors a low score.  It's kind of funny how obvious this is.
You guys copied the channel hiho kids
hold on, cuz people instead of using the soup powder, they make their own with different spices? am i living in a lie or is this just something regular AND LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'FLOODED''? ITS LITTERLY HOW YOU MAKE RAMEN
Ya'll don't like broth with your ramen ? 😭
Why does she look like Aerial??-
IS RAMEN NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER?? 😭
if im broke and having cheap ramen il soak it in soup and float that noodle just so it can get big then eat it whit soup
this is painful to watch if your gonna make ramen aleast make it good it dosen't have to be amazing
when im going to college yall gon have to watch out for my ramen 😈
thanks for making this video, my life could be a LOT worse but i still haven't had real meat in months and all your other videos make my stomach feel so empty it hurts. but this one killed my appetite. so thanks.
girl said her mom is spanish..
Why did y’all give them spoons c’mon😭😭😭
They don't know how to cook ramen properly, that's just sad...
the 2nd girl got humbled real fast
The 2 mf who said the ramen was watery are stupid, like gurl, it's supposed to be watery, how do you think they ea tit in Asia, dry as the Sahara desert?
None of you can cook
Ur all bad cooks
I can't believe they complaining about noodles having broth and not being dry.
And I am sad that these kids do not even know that actual "Ramen" has "Broth"! Like, not even supposed to be dry like that. This is horrendous. Call that noodles, not RAMEN.
They have to try Indomie and Shin Ramyun. Maruchan is nothing compared to those two.
Black people be so self centred
Cheyenne’s ramen actually looked sooo good broo
sorry all those ramen look disgusting, i do my ramen even better
I don’t dislike videos often but I’m going to because y’all could’ve really had a fun video and instead you settled for stupidity and a half baked concept
oluwamayowa had the audacity to talk shit abt everyone else's ramen when her's literally lost
They gotta get someone Asian 😂
I am U T T E R L Y confused why the rest of ramen was dry and clumpy then I realised that they just don't know how to cook ramen.
“i would prefer my ramen a little more…..dry”  GIRLY-
Broke college kids why da title be like dis
Haiyaa
these dudes are a fucking joke to ramen society
Those other two need to go back to school coz WHO TF THINKS RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE DRY!!!!! TF 🤣🤣
I’m African and I approve you do NOT put ALL of our spices in ramen only some
okay how i make my ramen i guess-  make that ramen while adding the flavor packet.  drain out half of the broth and put into a boul.  add some hot sauce and make some bacon.  chop the bacon up and put into the ramen.  add some pepper to be ✨fancy✨
Isnt ramen supposed to have some broth or soup with it?! Because without it, it feels like somethings missing, also the way cheetah girl was so confident-
Olu was overconfident and was criticizing the others ramen.. and she got a 2 Like she got humbled so hard 💀
Lol funny how they all broke and black
“season the ramen” girl…no one has time for that and u talk abt “season the ramen” bby girl, ur ramen is dry. seasoning is the last thing u need.
“I prefer my ramen a little bit dry” Yeah we noticed.. literal clumps 😭
Ovo u opste nije ramen
olu was sassy fr, talking shit about everyone like she own it
Lowkey hope they never go to Japan,  when they are making ramen broth for 10+ hours
i like when the ones that talk most game dont win, like the cheetah print girly fr acting like her ramen was good THEN ENDED UP WITH A TWO LMFAOO
Damn, they all stupid asf
What broth lmfao
this funny😭💀
They all bad 😭
Cheetah print and dude be doing too much. Its a 50¢ meal. Boil ramen, add seasoning packet and cook for 3-5 minutes. If you wanna be fancy, drop in an egg, some green onions, and chili oil.
Dang they were all haters.
bye the way they arent admitting the ramen is good at the end..
ITS SOUP… it’s not CHOW MEIN
Like watching kids figure out how to feed themselves 😂
The ramen look dry.😂
kkk, we can all agree all of them suck lol.
how do you fuck up making noodles this badly
yeah lol that's like, the entire reason instant ramen was made
Why they using spoons?
“Sorry to that man” made me laugh. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“i prefer mine a bit dry” OH WE KNOW YOU AINT EVEN GOTTA SAY IT
Imma not suppose to eat it with the soup .....the "water" 🥲🥲
Uk when u don't put enough water in the ramen and it turn dryyy, that's how the second girl ramen sound
Bpt!!!!!’
“look it’s a clump 🙄” 😭
Full packet, half the block cooked in water for three min. Try it with the crunchy. The best way I know of doing it is cooking it without the package of sauce first. Then drain some out. Don't forget the water to drink out 'cause you are going to suffer the salt 🧂😳 🙏🤟😋
the AUDACITY olu haddd i cant even
cheyennes looks really good, but i wouldnt have it as soupy! but Olu's, ok so i dont mind kinda dry ramen but THAT looked too dry
Yes there is supposed to be broth in the soup smh watery where did you get these people
Wow. Where did you get these people
Why are they all black
5:38 “a little bit more dry” 😭😭😭 girl why are you saying anything you got a 2 and your ramen was drier than the Sahara desert LMAO
So glad they shit on Olu’s 😂
My ramen would SHIT ON YALL’!
Bro the 2nd one who showed their ramen was hating on everyone even tho hers was the worst
Olu got humbled 😭
I'm sorry guys they all looked nasty to me...
Cheyenne made the best one. It's the only one that was actually cooked like ramen 😅
ITS LITERALLY CALLED RAMEN NOODLE SOUP. SOUP IS WATERY. SOUP HAS LIQUIDDDSDD
“it’s salty” ramen is salty 💀
Bruhhh Ramen is supposed to have broth 🤦🏽‍♀️
BREH YOU DID NOT ADD SEASONING SALT TO RAMEN WTF?!?!?!? INSTANT RAMEN IS SALTY ALREADY
too broke to afford water in your ramen?
They liked the last one, they just didnt wanna give props
god the other two were lowkey annoying. they’re acting like they’ve been to 5 star high end restaurants that are only serving ramen. they’ve not study in the kitchen mfs never put broth but the black girl ☠️☠️
this is not ramen its "noodles with spices and chicken"
why the spoons wtf 😭
This video has to be a JOKE 😭💀
thought i was tripping and was contemplating whether ive been making my ramen all wrong but thank god for the comments
I'm super glad Marcus was #2 on points because Olu's ego was so huge that she got two points. Karma's gonna track you down. Step by step, from town to town.  The broth makes the ramen noodles very soft and edible.
man i just add shredded cheese LMAOOO
WTF RAMEN IS MEANT TO HAVE BROTH TAHT ULO GIRL IS OUT OF HER MIND GIRL BYE.ALSO THAT GUY IS GETTING ON MY NERVES HE SAYS ITS GOOD BUT THEN SAYS NO LIKE WHAT?
They should’ve done it blind folded
love how cheeta girl was a bit cocky "i'm gonna win" and then she automatically LOSES LMFAOO
The winner’s ramen did look gray in not gonna lie but maybe because of the oyster sauce
Pls don’t drain the broth from ramen. That’s what gives it the flavor
There’s always that one person who hates on everyone’s food but then makes the worst one possible. 😂 Not to mention it’s not “water” it’s broth and ramen is supposed to have broth!!
They don’t know how to cook
it’s so dry omg 😭
She messed up by waking up in the morning 😂
i like how the leopard print girl said that the first one was dry but hers is in CLUMPS.
Cheetah print girl peaked in hs
“Come on guys it’s ramen!” Yeah so it’s supposed to have broth in it 😞
1. *Ramen* has broth, dry *noodles* dont have broth. DONT CALL IT RAMEN IF IT DOESNT HAVE BROTH 2. How they eating *noodles* with a *spoon* 3. They actually liked the last one, but pretended not to because they didnt like how it looked😅😅
Bruh she tripping and being extra how she gon say season the noodles after saying it was too salty🤷🏽‍♀️
This is THE first Cocoa Butter video I've watched where I don't want to eat anyone's food.
RAMEN IS LITERALLY SOUP WTF PLEASE HELP
cheetah needs to calm down
Damn you godda call them broke
whoever has no water in they ramen, unless it’s creamy, needs to like.. never make any. again.
I only like the last girls cause hers looks the best like why do y’all have chunks and stuff in yours?!
Dude I thought ramen was supposed to be cooked. They all look unappetizing no offense😐
why the first two amek thgem sticky and clumpy help do people actually eat them like that
this bitch said “It’s salty “ then said where’s the seasoning gtfkkkk😹😂😂
Marcus & Olu. I have 3 words for both of you: be so foreal.
No way… I could’ve made it way better than all of them combined
I use Sriracha and a bit of mayo. Also whatever veggies i have atm.
it’s literally ‘ramen noodle soup’ …
THE WATER = BROTH and that’s what makes it good 😭😭😭
I just know they'd like my ramen tho 😂
Are they aware ramen is a soup😭😭😭😭
The sweetest one is always the winner and the meanest one always has the worst food 😂
its crazy they saying the ramen is “too watery” when that wasn’t even a lot of broth😭😭
i was so dissapointed when it didnt show the other girls reaction to losing
I already knew olu was gonna be a hater 😭😭😭
Cheetah girl and the boy big L
Nun of them know how to boil sum noodles 🌚
Only time I ever eat ramen without broth is when im impatient and eat the shit raw. RAMENS MEANT TO HAVE BROTH😭😭
i was think this channel show traditional, just mericans do merican food
if you don’t have water in ur ramen ur doing something hella wrong
Why they out here soundin like they ain’t ever have instant ramen soundin bougie asf and food ain’t lookin the part lol
caption crazy😂
My go to college ramen is mama brand. They're from thai land and its aboutnthe same price as top ramen or maruchan, but the flavors ans everything are WAY better. Throw some tuna or chicken in there, hit it with a bit of sauce (depends on how i'm feeling. Sometimes it just some sriracha, sometikes its my mom's dumpling sauce if i'm feeling zesty.) Crack and egg into it right after you remove it from heat and let the residual heat cook the egg while you stir it. Garnish with ginger, garlic, and green onion, and hitnitnwith a tiny bit more sesame seed oil. Flavor town, my friends. All for about a dollar
help olu really emberrass her self got a 2 and thought she ate
They should have a contest between ex prisoners and college student ramens and have two taste judges that dont know which ones are from the prisoners or which ones are the college students and see who wins that one😂
im the 30,000 comment
THE BROTH IS THE BEST PART THO? I-?!😭💀
HOW THE FUCK DO U GET DRY RAMEN
Why TF IS THERE SPOONS
Olu got me tight ngl😅
The cheetah print girl killed me she was so confident and had the worst
bye ain't none of them know how to make ramen
Cheyenne is the only one who cooked hers right and included the broth. The way she described it also really makes me want to try it myself. I'm glad she won because she deserves it and the ones criticizing hers harshly really have no room to talk when their ramen looked drier than the Sahara desert.
They are adults not kids bruh
The one criticizing the most always has the worst 😂
I’m sure they had parents for backup. If you have no family life in general is hard
The one in the cheetah fit thought it was a 5 star meal zzzz . Ramen can be prepare to its maker liking doesn't have " the right ramen"  like I eat my Ramen with eggs xD
sorry, what? HUH?????? you guys don't make ramen with hot water and the provided seasoning??
Whats painful to me is: " ITS TOO WATERYYY wah wah " Cheetah BITC- baby, being a " chef " when she made Legos 💀 None of them adding a lot of hot sauce in theirs ..(this isn't that painful cause some people can't handle spice.) These two mfs trying to bring that last one down just cause of its looks lmao
I'm glad she won...haters 😂😂😂
I don’t really like the fact that Olu can judge the ramen first and not even give it a taste.
why all their ramens looking like dat bruh it ain’t that hard to make some damn ramen 😭😭.. coming from a 🇩🇴
It’s ramen noodle soup 💀
Why you have to add “broke” 💀 just say college students we know they broke
Where is the BROTH?
This is racist .Poor things
When I make ramen, I pour all the water out and THEN put in the sauces after I microwave it. I just feel like the flavours are better that way. Am I wrong for doing this?
MISS CHEETAH GIRL. PLEASE STOP ACTING LIKE YOUR A ALL STAR CHEF WHEN YOUR RAMEN LOOKED AS DRY AS THE SAHARA DESERT.
Ummmm bro and sis with the curly hair never had authentic ramen?!?!
put me on the show man highschool student can make it better 😭
They don't know how to make ramen.  Yikes...
they all suck
The ramen they used isn't meant to be a dry ramen, that's why it was all clumpy. In conclusion...all three dishes were trash, and others in the comment section are right about a re-do.
Why they eating it with a spoon 🥄 😂😂😂
God everything about this video is wrong😭😂💀
Me and my brother know how cook the best ramen and I only 8
bruh i was waiting so excitedly for that nigerian girl to get HUMBLED cuz...you are not that gas
They somehow found 3 college kids who don’t know how to make Ramen
eating ramen with a spoon is crazy
"I personally like my Ramen a little dry"  ... yeah we see that
“ my momma Spanish “
Cheetah girl makin' me heated so bad rn while eating noodles making me clench my teeth over here and shit 😭
Chopin: hold my revolutionaryare we just gonna ignore the fact that they’re eating it with a spoon?
The broth is my favorite part😭haters fr
These kids were eating drymin with a spoon. What in the actual fuck is happening?
Woooo Lord, they say pride goeth before destruction, and Miss Leopard Print got BULLDOZED.
i would always add old bay seasoning, cheese, and a sunny side up egg on top of my ramen but that's just me. most the time i actually would just make egg drop soup, cheap and quick to make for a college kid lol. i've had some pretty tasty ramen made elote style though, with hot cheetos. that was fire ramen right there
Y’all wild for acting like Black people don’t eat they ramen with no broth, be fr
they knew they liked the last one but being haters 😭
These students are NOT from Chicago😭😭😭😭
forget it let me make some noodles😭😂
How are they so picky? All 3 ramen look like shite
the "seasoning" packet says soup on it
I mean comparing soup in ramen to a tsunami is kinda insensitive and fucked
Like...where's the water?
The second one had to be a joke
none of this is ramen bro. like do they cook ts at home and transport it oorrrrr. where is the broth. egg, spam, furikake like come on that isn’t ramen
The girl in cheetah print is being so judgemental about the food when theres actual CLUMPS in the food they both had the right to rate 0 and 2 she says she adds all theese cool spices and is acting like she had the best one. Cheyenne was very underrated when it came to Olu. Im not sure how Olu felt when she found she only had a rating of 2
Why were most of these ramens dry? It's seriously all about the broth and flavors that give it the Umami taste. I don't know if they had real ramen but this just isn't it.
Ramen is originally a soup...so, its too wet?
None of it looked good. It was all very beige. They all need to Google "easy ramen hacks". It is the help they need
Them hating on the last girl's ramen because it was too wet is the equivalent of hating crackers because it's too dry. Like no shit it's wet, cause IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE smh
the water is like the best part of ramen 😂.
Bro they need broth like what type of ramen
Bro asked for more shrimp like they aren't broke college students
It amazes me people actually act like cheetah girl
How the hell can you mess up ramen it’s the easiest thing to cook in the world
Shooooot now I don't feel bad when I made ramen at 4am this morning starving 🤣 I didn't use the packet & put my own seasonings in it along with some butter in the BROTH & I thought it was lovely lmao _Who wants DRY ramen?!_
The fact they don’t know ramen is literally supposed to have broth is seriously sad . Find people that actually grasp the concept of ramen !
it’s always so refreshing to see the cocky and narcissistic type people who are so persistent on their dish being the best, get humbled and lose when their dish is usually the nastiest LOOL
Olu.. please explain yourself
mayowa no try for us nigerians mehn eishhhh😭
PUT ME IN THERE BC ALL THEIR RAMENS LOOK NAST AFFFFFFFF
Looks like none of them put any significant effort into this at all. Cheetah shirt girl is incredibly arrogant and annoying.
Ramen is supposed to be a noodle soup. If it’s dry, you did it wrong.
this is embarrassing
You can’t ramen without the broth 💀 it’s where the flavor is at 😭😭😭
I like water left in my noodles
that big ass hair girl is only ranking ppl low so she can win
All looked trash.
i loce how the cheetah print girl tried to bring everyone else down, like for the ladt ramen she was like "oh it taste good, the shrimp is good ngl" but then at the end she was like "i don't wanna eat this at first sight, and the shrimp is the only thing that is making it good so 3/10." like this girl competitive af
The other two shook that the one with liquid was actually good. Well, duh! But then they start insulting it towards the end trying to act like they hadn't just said it was good... I can't with these clowns. 🤡🤡
She was really like "I would prefer my ramen a bit more dry."  Girl, we saw. We know.
I love my ramen as a soup, idk why these people are calling it "watery", if you was really struggling, you'd be on that soup life. The liquid HOLDS flavor and helps fill your belly.
Im so confused with them complaining about the “water” on the last ramen, like, the soup, specially if it’s spicy, is THE BEST part of it.  dry ramen is good sometimes but with a good soup? That’s soul food
"watery ramen" bitch are you stooooopid
Y’all just be finding people cuz what was that? Thank you Cheyenne
None of these people know what *RAMEN* is
chicken ramen is a new thing?? 😭😭 girl where you been
Cheyenne is so pretty!
What are you doing if you don’t put kimchi and crack an egg in your ramen 😂 that’s how I like mine.
Gurl out her talking about how much better her ramen is and saying the other contestants ramen is shit AND SHE COMES OUT WITH THESE DRY SALTINE CRACKER CLUMPS like bffr
Po Chirrin. Ramen is a soup. It's supposed to have a broth.
the dood in this makes me wanna kms magine geting of a shift n talkin hat much shit prefcite the food someone woulf cook for you
I think every Asian viewer cringed when they saw what the noodles looked like the bowls. It's good to add meat and vegetables to it to bulk up the portion size of the noodles and makes it filling. More vegetables gives some fiber intake and counters the mostly sodium based seasonings and flavorings that go into the noodles. Also, did these three students use noodles from a packet or did they get those 6-in-a-pack instant noodle packets from the supermarket and prepare them in their own style?
marcus and cheetah girls ramen look so eww
American peoples idea of ramen is so disgusting lmfao
so far I haven't seen any ramen with broth in it...what are college students doing these days? Thick soggy noodles. wow, how long it been sitting before served? This is an edit...So the first 2 didn't have broth and the 2 with the worst looking ramen tried to clown having broth on the 3rd one. Again though, how long has the ramen been sitting? It all looks cold or microwaved
If they complained about ramen being watery then im sorry you need new people for the ramen cooking challenge cause thats how ramen is supposed to be like noodles, broth, and toppings
It’s crazy how they were complaining about how dry the others were but then complained about how watery the last one was 😵‍💫😂
I make better ramen
6:35 I’m so sorry but I hate people like him. He’s so fake and bougie and I know that nasty ass attitude come from his white side. Peep how he ate the shrimp and spit out all the noodles just so he can win the competition and deny the girl her credit. Vile ass man.
It’s a soup and they are complaining that it has liquid in it?!
before trying to cook ramen again please make sure  is used 6:16 NO WAY! Water is used in making ramen?? Maybe thats why noodles are watery?
I’m I the only that thinks the guy looks like Sid the Science kid ? 😮
You can tell the girl in the leopard print was never a real broke college kid plus she's a c u next Tuesday
Why are “dry” and “ramen” being used in the same sentence? 😭
Let me smell it to make I’m not eating anything bad😂
bro none of them can cook these ramen they all kinda ass especially olu her personality also trash
The fact that these are college students...with no common sense... The future looks so bleak.
Imagine being hungry and throwing out half the food. You can literally fill your belly with just broth. Ramen is soup not pasta. Wtf even is this?
these kids are haters
Where is the BROTH?!!!😭
Oluwamayowa was soo confedent like She was soo sassy and she hated every ramen bowl atleast the another contestants where hontest she lied just to win that’s soo rude but I’m happy she dint win soo she could stop being sassy and mean
I love all these videos but this one irritated my soul. Lol Ramen is a soup and they are eating it like it’s stir fry noodles. Ramen is about the broth and they ruined it! Ughhhh. 😫 Also I need for people to read the packaging. It clearly says soup and says nothing about pouring out the broth. Lol
Love when the cocky ones get smashed. 😂😂😂 Cheetah print thought she had it. Boom 🤯 in ya face.
My mans some shade of grey I swear
Humbled her ahh so fast 😭
Brooo why where they eating it with a spoon 😭😭😭
Come on sih it ain't raymen it's Rom-en the A is silent for us😫
Bro it’s broth stop callin it water 😭
how do i get on here. id slaughter
What is wrong with these kids. Ramen is soup. I make the best ramen. But I'm not broke or a kid.😂
she so broke but got money for crayfish and expensive spices in college spent her book money on her african spices
The dumbarses do realise ramen comes with a broth. It's not a "dry" food 😂
A “little bit more dry” GIRL your ramen HAS CLUMPS they aren’t even cooked 😭
There’s always a hater.
🥲 I feel sorry for them. Ramen dishes can be so versatile and gourmet. Making eating cheap as a student a pleasurable experience for your palate.
this is the worst episode ive seen from this channel, none of them know what theyre doing. RAMEN HAS BROTH, EGG OR PORK IS THE MOST COMMON ADDED INGREDIENTS
LMFAO boy girl what!?! 😂 “soupy” “watery” shut up lol
I thumbs down bc the cheeta lady
Cheetah girl looking like that having the nerve to talk like this
i thought ramen was soupy
Sideshow bob in the cheetah print needs to realize shes too broke to act so boujie
Brooooo wtf 😭😭😭
the black girl is so rude
Cheetah was like "it's salty" "are you trying to kill me" ramen ment to have salt
People always was weirded out by water in my noodles, but it is considered soup right?
She made ninjago city😂
I don’t know if it’s just me, but I can’t stand these people I don’t like them, I don’t like the way they speak. I don’t like their attitudes, I don’t like the way they react on things, and I don’t like to hear their opinions that come out of their stupid little mouths. They just annoy the shit out of me.
I feel like if you're that broke than the struggle meal would just be ramen straight out the package with nothing else added to it since the additions would cost money. Money you claim to not have.
all i eat everyday is plain ramen with the seasoning packet all 3 look better than what i make tbh
69
Cook your ramen like you would and after it gets done crack an egg into it turn off the heat and cover the egg with noodles set a timer for 3 mins. While you are waiting for the egg to cook put chili paste garlic the white part of green onions and the seasoning packet in a non stick pan on medium low heat let it cook for about 15 seconds then add any type of cheese once the cheese starts to stick to the pan add milk slowly while mixing until the consistency is that of a thick sauce. By this time the egg should be done cooking. Take the egg out of the ramen and put the ramen in the sauce pan without the broth and mix the sauce in. Put the ramen in a bowl and while you wait for it to cool fry some ham once the ham is done place the ham on one side of the bowl. Cut open the egg and place it on the other side. Then sprinkle the green parts of green onion in the middle and enjoy  There are also different ways you can cook the egg, soft boiled, sunny side up/fried, or just crack it in and stir it in
The cockiest contestants always have the worst dishes 😂
You guys season ramen now what!
WHY SHE EATING IT HALF COOKED
Do this with adults plsss
Eating noodles with a spoon is crazy
bro's a ninja turtule with mbappe
The noodles look dry and overcooked to me….
Do these students know what broth is?
different vibe = go woke = go broke lmfao
Nothing beats a good ol convicts ramen
Bro really spoons?
I really like this dish, imma give it a 6.
Did they forget that they’re eating this in a Broke College Student way. Of course it’s not going to look fancy or even look good sometimes. It’s the matter if it’s edible.
Why is the ramen so dry? Where’s the broth? Is this how y’all eat it? 😂
I’m gonna start a channel, only have white people on it and call it White Bread 😂
I cooked better ramen when I was in 5th grade, in dorms with a boiler and mug in my room at 2 am for me and my roommates.
As a former 4 year old i totally get what he is going through
Why don’t anyone but the one girl like soupy ramen? I love the soup that’s the best part?!
How does olu go from it’s so salty to it needs flavor likeee 🥱
I take my noodles out of the broth until it cools down enough to eat it because I hate soggy mushy noodles. Also where’s the chopsticks you’re supposed to have ramen with chopsticks it’s a whole different experience
So the winner followed the instructions on the packet.
What the fuck are they on
"i prefer my ramen a little more dry" we can tell
“I prefer mine a little dry” We know 💀
Shout out to da shrimps
Cool in the shade!
Olu made me realize that theres a such thing as too much confidence
what.... who taught these people how to cook ramen... where's the broth?!
I hate that afro girl she thinks she's better than everyone
Honestly, I like cheetah girl’s vibe I think I would go with her and I had way worse ramen why are you guys being so rude!
as a nigerian, this is not okay somebody teach this girl how to cook wth
This is SOOO embarrassing like omg 😭 they’re horrible at making ramen
They all look like absolute shit
Why are most of these contestants so rude? I guess that's what the producers are looking for
“Needs more shrimps” MARCUS, The competition is “BROKE college students try…” You lucky you even GOT shrimps! Foh!
The way that one girl was talking about how good her ramen until they tried it
Olu and Marcus showed up just to be critical, happy that they were both on the bottom with that dried dish.
The one who's always downing everyone's food, always are the worst cook and the loser, without fail.
I love how the girl who was MOST shady  had a two rating😭
Shorty with the chunky ass ball ramen had the most too say and it looked horrible
Afro girl so annoying not even 2 minutes in full of her self 😂😂😂
Why is their ramen DRY. EW
olu says she'll win because hers is best but its literally undercooked clumps of dry noods and prob taastes like salt lol AND SHE LOST lol
Oh oh oh... what's this? i thinks its called...hmm...BROTH?!
All 3 dishes look like sh!t.
You cant even call that ramen
her ramen is the best  nooooooooo girl lol
There eatting with a spoon😂
ramens not supposed to be a soup perhaps your shitty home made ramen if you want but you don't add much broth to the noodles at all or you're gonna have soggy noodles these comments are killing me bruh.  I make my ramen and while it's cooking I put the seasoning packet in the bowl im gonna use and then also add a spoon full of some home made chili oil mmmmm that shit is good af and then I will make me two burger patties and when the ramen is done I pour about three spoon fulls of water from the ramen into the bowl with the chili oil and seasoning and stir it in nicely and then drain the rest of the water and put the noodles into the bowl mix it well so the flavor gets into the noodles and then add the burgers on top if you fill your bowl even half way up with the water then you're making ramen a lot worse than it has to be lmao.  to clarify about half of the water she had in her ramen is about what you want but the girl olu I knew from the start her dish was gonna be trash "I cook with seasonings they probably never even heard of" it's not the fucking 1920's we have the internet they probably have a broader understanding of seasoning than she does that girl needs an ego check.
Title said fuck you
Why are you doing this video with college students who have no idea on how to make proper ramen? 😭 do it with japanese people or chefs theyd have a better grasp
how can someone so pretty be SO DAMN ANNOYING
All three failed
This should be called how not to make ramen 😂
If u can’t eat ramen dry u not broke . If it’s nasty u not hungry . Meaning u had other options so stfu
Ramen is a soup. What is wrong with this place. Clearly the last girl is the only one that knows how to prepare.
Cheetah girls problem is that hers is too dry and she says that the girls ramen has too much water like wtf. And she tryna give criticism when hers is the worst....cmon now be realistic
olu pisses me off
they need to lower their standards for this challenge😭
She got humbled real fast 💀 😂
Olu is a hater 😂😂😂😂😂
Ramen is soup based… obviously the college they paid for is not helping with their brain development.
"Its salty like aRe YoU TrYiNg To KiLl Me" GURL u r overreacting also shes literally a pick mee
Mel B came in talking a bit game but she brought the dustiest bustedest ramen I've ever seen 😂😂😂😂
WHY ARE ALL OF THEIRS DRYYY!??? WHERES THE BROTH! 🥹
oh maaaan i really loved witnessing everyone eat and rate each others' ramen. literally the best ever. i love how everyone talked up the ramen they made; I'd believe Oluwamayowa's ramen as delicious based on the self-description. loved seeing Cheyenne win and Marcus commentary too wheewwwww <3 <3 <3 icons
ok i can say with confidence all of em f*cked up their ramen
Grandaddy from the island of Guam(meaning they COOOOKS) and one day he gave me a plate of fried ramen, fried wit butter after you season it up how you like. That was 15 years ago snd I ain’t stopped frying my noodles ever since. Texture is out of the world. Ain’t gotta worry abt it being soggy or mashy. Try it
Cheetah print   Jus.   Amazes me how someone can be like that.  Terrible fkn ramen too they should’ve threw it away. 😂😂😂😂she said 000000 4:55
adult children
It’s so salty r YoU trYiNg tO kiLl mE 😭
The last ramen was the one that looked like ramen it's supposed to have water in it
All of them did worse than the worst I thought it could get..
ama be honest YALL DONT KNOW HOW OT MAKE RAMEN fr yall need to go back to yall mom and learn how to cook get some cooking classes yall bad as hell even i know how to make ramen good and am only 12 turning 13 in a few days its pretty embarrsing and shameful ya self and parents and am telling you all even if ya broke you cans till make ramen good all ya gotta do is boil it to how u like add the pepper and the packet dats if ya broke and if ya have money then ya can add some seasoning i like my own extraaa spicy i add boil egg have a cold class of juice etc i had some parsley and some ham or anything releted to meat etc  i feel really bad for the parents who raised them and its not to say a 10 year old dont know how to make ramen so the fact that their adultls and they dont know how to make proper ramen its just sad also btw guys not all 10 and 9 year olds will know how to make ramen is more like 50 to 50 basically half  and no hate just my opinion also the cheetah print girl if u see this YOUR RAMEN ISTHE WORST OUT OF THE ALL atleast the others did something and u be hyping it up like if it good when its horrible as hell-

i was so ready to get sum tips from cheetah girl what da hell
The last girl did the best. But you can clearly see that none of them were taught how to cook. This is coming from a skilled home chef.
NAH ANYONE CAN COOK RAMEN BETTER THAN CHEETAH GIRL
Neuron science 😮 waw
Bye all you need is garlic salt a splash of vinegar and hot sauce
Ramen is watery is not spagueti wth lol
i actually can say i make the best ramen and everyone i make it for agrees

girl with the cheetah shirt CANNOT be talkin
"maroochin ramen"
It’s so sad to see almost grown ppl fail to make ramen and cheeta girl is to self obsorbed and the flipping fact they hate the wet ramen is stupid like how…..all ramen have a soup Iike? That’s stupid and like I get y’all were broke but like don’t u get a free don and don’t have to pay rent like? And I feel like they have a microwave or a stove but like I’m glad the winner is the winner cuz like.. she deserves it

Did they ever redo this video? They need to. Please try again because hecky nah
Cheetah girl a hater off the top
Cheetah girl annoyed me so much low key
they are all so judgmental and all their ramens look like shit
Ramen translated means Noodle SOUP and soup needs WATER 💀
cheetah girl got alot to say when. her shi look dry n not cooked as if she wasnt broke too
Me bc I eat ramen raw and cooked…
They do not know what broth Is💀
Okay I NEEEDS to see what cheetah girl thought about her ranking being a 2 😂
“it’s too watery” ITS RAMEN, RAMEN HAS BROTH???
Cheetah girl is a brat
Oluwmayowa 😒😒😒
I love how the girl who made fun of Marcus who was so boastful got the lowest rating and worst noodles
Cheetah girl was talking smack hold video her stuff suck.😂
cheyanne defly deserved to win
"It has water in it" HELP😭😭
My god i can cook better noodles what the hell is that
They need to get a grasp that ramen is supposed to be watery…
What's up with all that dry ramen? All of it sounded nasty AF. Ramen as a dish IS soup. It's meant to have broth. SMH. This was a total hot mess.
This was painful to watch wth
Nigerian noodles HEY!💀
“it has water in it 😮” IT’S RAMEN??? ITS MEANT TO HAVE SOUP WHAT ARE YALL ON. uncultured af
Cheetah girl saying I want to make sure I am not eating anything bad is the funniest thing to me 💀
I honestly prefer my ramen dry, but I do get that people love the slurp of their ramen. And I am nigerian, so I'm guessing it's a nigerian thing.
Do these people know what ramen is? Isn’t ramen suppose to be eaten with some broth?
Whyyyyy are all of them so dry
“It’s a little watery” but it’s soup….there has to be a bit of broth right?
How cheeta print says the first dish was salty, then says  it doesn't have flavor........?
He wasn't broke if he had chicken to add to the Ramen
Not enough this not enough that, and yet you're still fuckin eating it guy...
ever heard of *broth*
the fact that they were given spoons bro 😭
Olu is kinda getting me mad
Cook the ramen al dente, drain 90% of the water off, add seasoning, add cheese, add tuna fish, and add peas. After a couple minutes of mixing it completely, turn it off. The liquid from the peas and tuna will add more water to it, but not even where it becomes mushy.
ramen is a soup, they missing the whole point...atp u want pasta fr lmao
isnt ramen watery? Like it has soup?
We need to do a new one with people who actually atleast know how to cook their noodles . Like know what ramen is
its always the most confident ones who end up scoring the worst
girl bye the way they thought the ramen was watery like i thought it was supposed to be like that 😭 plus the cheetah print girls ramen was literally stiff she can’t be talkin bruh
“i dont like all the water” you mean the broth?? thats supposed to come w it??💀💀
My asian ancestors are CRYING lmfao
I’m literally so mad that they don’t have any broth in their ramen noodle. “ i like mine dry” ma’am, we can see that.
i js realized their eating ramen with spoons
I thought ramen was supposed to be wet not dry lol
None if them seem broke lol
5:49 bro ramen is normally served with soup wdym
Nah dry Ramen is insane
As a ramen LOVER since 2 years old, I am SHOOK that some people don’t eat their ramen as a soup!
Ramen, according to Google, is Chinese-styled noodles in a broth. The ramen is supposed to be watery and have texture. Cheyenne is the only one that understood this assignment, you should redo this video.
how do you fail to make ramen-
do people not know that Ramen is a noodle and it's supposed to have a broth
It can't be that hard to cook Ramen Noodles!   There are some nice Ramen noodles recipes on youtube and they could have googled some recipes.   None of those dishes impressed me at all!
I would’ve won this bro
Bro how could they like noodles dry like the broth is the best part that’s the reason they give a flavor/spice pack it’s to add flavor to the water
they took the raw in ramen (joke) too serious
The chia pet hating with the worst dish😂😂
I cannot believe a bunch of ex broke college students just completely dished out the other contestants like they didn’t have to same struggles like y’all really need to chill attacking people for their ramen😭
its so funny how the loser always has the MOST to say
If you like cheese, try this:  -1 packet of creamy chicken ramen noodles (Cook for 4.5 minutes in microwave without seasoning, with water then drain)  -Milk (after noodles are drained add desired amount of milk and seasoning packet, and stir in)  -add a slice of American cheese on top and add some hotdogs diced (you can add a squirt of ranch too for extra creaminess)!  Put in the microwave for another :30 seconds to 1:00 minute and enjoy.
How the fck you can be this bad at cooking a fcking ramen. I cant even cook and my ramen is better than this.
please, please, PLEASE, redo this with people who know how to make ramen, its supposed to be watery because ramen is made as a literal broth?! credit to the one girl who put SOME water yet still failed. Aside from that these are grown adults and they can hardly boil on the simplest meals known to humans.
These kids dojt even know what ramen IS
cheetah girl acted like she was all that with her ramen and was so rude but hers was in chunks like girl what the hell-
I’m in middle school and my ramen is better than this
But they fact the cheetah print girl (forgot her name) said the boy (forget his name too) ramen was dry when hers was drier than the shara dessert😅😂💀
2:25 -- it's too salty, but the ramen isn't seasoned. go away
sorry but why are they eating ramen or may i say noodles WITH A SPOON☠☠
the one with the worst food always has the cockyist attitude
idgi like ramen is a soup yall its not fuckin spaghetti
Tf. Ramen without water is noodles, its not ramen.
She can taste color like what🧌🧌🧌🧌also I love dry ramen but that can’t even be CONSIDERED dry ramen or ramen that’s just Lego blocks thats are wet

I like soggy ramen and the drier ramen. Both some yummy.
Cheyenne and Marcus’s ramen looks good ngl
The one that talks the most Ish, is ALWAYS the one w the worst dish. *bars*
Ramen is soup not a rice krispie treat,l☠️
The way I would actually BAGGGG this challenge 😭 the dry ass ramen made me think this was a JOKE 💀
bro that isnt even ramen anymore those are just some dry ass noodles
why did Olu have to keep talking 😭
Dude talks too much and assumes everything before Even trying it
Yeah I put spicy BBQ in my ramen. Can't beat that. Sounds weird, but taste delicious. Mine would have won
One of the people has the same name as me and it’s slightly rare!!!!
cheetah girl really needs to be humbled
Cheetah girl can’t cook for shit rather eat over cooked noodles foh 😂
Suddenly I feel better about my cooking skills.
“There gotta be more shrimp” BOY BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS CANT AFFORD SHRIMP LIKE THAT!!
Shawty in the leopard needs to chill. Seriously sweet pea, it's ramen. You act like your Gordon Ramsey of ramen noodles, but your not.
Isn’t Rammen supposed to be watery👁👄👁
I knew olu's was going to be the worst😂😂
No but why are they eating with a spoon
bring me on the show and ill show yall how its done fr
I knew the ramen the was a little soupy was going to win. That’s the best way🤷🏾‍♀️😂
It's not water, it's broth from the flavor packet, so we know who uses theirs.
ramen is a soupy dish. Looks like they don’t know Japan.😟
All of them looks dry and nasty to be honest..
This cheetah print is so judgemental, like I'm looking at it and know it ain't it.
distilled water, it's only a 1.50 plus you got water to drink add a lil extra for extra ingredients, boil top ramen and DO NOT drain, I repeat DO NOT drain, add  butter, 1 egg, the seasoning packet, add some hot sauce if you feelin add some parsley on my salt bae vibe and boom!
Ramen....is suppose to have water in it....water boils the noodles....smh...young people.
5:35   You don’t say 3:41
At least that last girl actually had water in it since it’s ramen, like they be saying too much and then they  actually like it
5:36 girly- it’s called broth one, and two you don’t like your ramen “more dry” you like that bitch uncooked 😂
It's ramen..theres supposed to be water 😂
I swear Olu just broke dry ramen into pieces then added spices 💀
Thats not how nigerian ramen is cooked sorry i am not nigerian yet nigerians gave me their indomie i know how their ramen is that girl is no
"The ramen's a bit watery" bro that's the broth it's good!
Ms girl was really hyping her ramen only to get a low score 😂
I was laughing so hard at the second one cuz she was so confident and hers was the worst.
Marcus is actually killing me LMFAOOOOO
im sorry but isnt ramen SOUP!? WHERE IS THE BROTH???
So ppl really don’t like juice n their ramen…I’m spooked😅
shawty got the most to say and had the WORST ramen i ever saw
This is how I make shin ramen as an 11 year old:   Step 1. Get a pot with water and let it boil   Step 2. When the water starts boiling add your ramen   Step 3. Halfway through the cooking process put the seasoning packet (obviously use something to mix)  Step 4. Right before it’s almost done get cheese (any kind u want) and put a lot over your ramen DONT MIX IT!  Step 5. Get a lid and cover the ramen   Step 6. Set it to the side until the cheese is all melted 😋  Step 7. Add any other toppings u want I like to put boiled eggs with mine   Step 8. Enjoy 😊 ❤
the girl with the afro got a lot to say but idek if i would call her food "ramen"
Ummmm have any of them actually eaten real ramen before?!?!
Why should anyone take your critique seriously when you can't even serve a soup in a bowl the right way
"i don't like the ramen" and " i prefer mine a bit dry" are actually illegal sentences??
2:43 baby your ramen was bricks
The Nigerian girl gotta chill out here thinking she Gordon Ramsay 🤣
Who tf eats ramen with a spoon 💀
Y'all need to do a redo with people that actually know how to cook.  Or at least know how to boil water.. and understand the concept of soup
They all look horrendous literally ramen is an easy step meal 😭
What broke college student can afford shrimp??!! 🍤 that’s a luxury lol
only thing my ass can do is take a cup o noodles and then add a mass of seasoning and i know damn well my shit taste better than whatever the fuck these mufuckas made... cheetah print why u eating bricks
Not sure why they were using a spoon to eat ramen noodles and who the heck actually has all those extra ingredients to add to Ramen when you're in college?
I liked Cheyenne the most
how the fuck is this ramen without soup
cheeta girl really thought she ate
He said "muh roo chin"💀 1:39
This video was just recommended to me and I love it but  honestly, how can you have clumps in your Ramen?
"I like my ramen a little dryer"  - I felt my ancestors come to me like aang when he went into the avatar state, the way I said " We Know "...
Bruh, real ramen is SUPPOSED to have the broth in it I-
i literally watched this a year ago and i didnt even notice they're eating ramen with a SPOON until now.
None of these mfs know how to make ramen 😂 I grew up in the hood have them try my shii
Your broke... Try to get a part time.... Get grants... And choose a field you can actually get a job with! (Not theory, social justice, or that crap), or just leave college and go to a trade school and maybe get an apprenticeship and make big bucks there!
why are they eating with a spoon  why is it dry  i have so many questions
"i'll prefer my ramen a bit more dry" 5:37  "Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a *broth* " girl 😭
Me over here feeling like my ramen is basic asf and then seeing this video….😂 At least my noodles are cooked! But hey, no shade from me. They gave it a shot and did their best.
Is it just me wondering why they eating it with a spoon?😂
Isn’t ramen supposed to have water!?? Lol
"It's like a bowl of breadcrumbs"  😭✋🏽
Imagine whipping up a prison spread 😂
I feel like a Michelin Star Chef after watching this video lol
Bro everyone is talking about the cheetah girl but no one talking about them using a spoon
"there's water in it" YES WITHOUT THE "WATER" IT WOULDNT BE CONSIDERED FUCKING RAMEN, IT WOULD BE A YAKISOBA WITH RAMEN INSTEAD OF SOBA, RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO  HAVE A BROTH FOR FUCK SAKE IMA JUMP OFF A CLIFF
yall suck at cooking instant nooodles????!!! like ffs lmaooooo
who eats ramen with a spoon
Nah I know how to make better ramen I can make you some chili ramen with egg and seasoning maybe some green onion or creamy chicken ramen with chicken egg and bamboo shoots with other toppings optional
Y r they all dragging each other like what
Oluwamayowa: my ramen is givin flavor it’s givin spiceee  Marcus and cheyenne : 🤢
Chilleeee
The cheetah girl was mean💀She kept making her ramen seem really good but everyone hated it😂
Almost thought I have been cooking ramen the wrong way for over  a decade😅 lol..
cheetah girl didnt even fully cook hers n she tells people 2 season their ramen
"It has water in it, I prefer mine to be a little more dry"  ... yeah dry and clumped 😢😢😂
I personally feel like this is racist the title is “broke college kids” and they were all black kids🥲
bruh it’s not even ramen anymore wtf? it’s just pasta… no broth… no pork or soft boiled egg
Pov: ramen is supposed to be watery.
Take away the kitchen from all these people but Cheyenne…  if they are going to do broth less ramen they should have something with some thickness in it to cling onto the noodles or they should do like a hot oil fry situation with some aromatics like green onion and peppers. Idk if that would be good though cause I’ve never tried it with that kind of instant ramen but surely it’d be better than just draining it and adding the seasoning packet? Who am I to talk though haha I’ve made some interesting ramen choices before XD. The other night I added cooked ramen noodles and the packet to egg drop soup. It was okay I guess, but it didn’t do what I thought it was going to do, which I’m not even sure what was, it was edible though. Also a lot of food I couldn’t even finish half of it XD.
Bruh they just put them in here and said they broke
The African girl was annoying lol
HELP THE CHEETAH  girls rating LMFAO
Cheetah girls ramen looks like stale moldy ramen that sits in the back of my fridge, Bet its cold and crunchy..
I'm 8 years old and I know how  to actually boil noodles in a pot with water and seasoning.
Imagine going to a Ramen competition whilst you dont even know how to cook ramen
could get people that know what ramen is next time please
Ummmm….. ramen is a soup. They all loose lol
THIS OFFENDS ME SO MUCH. Not only were they so confident whilst being rude to each other, they TOTALLY overlook THE FACT--literally fact--THAT RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH. RAMEN IS NOODLES **AND** *BROTH.*  My good lord, why were they all acting like that?? All the broke kids out there or who came from poverty, don't be fucking mean to other people in the struggle. I'll respect Cheyenne at least was trying to be civil. But the other two? Nahh, that's rude as hell and for what? Especially to be so rude yet so fucking uneducated about ramen. Like if you don't enjoy *your* instant ramen with water, sure; but to say it reminds you of street ramen or to act like it's shitty for the fact of it having broth is so laughably and ridiculously absurd. PLEASE for the love of god talk to a Japanese or Korean student next time on how to better make your cheap instant ramen lmao.
this was painful to watch, but very entertaining. ramen is supposed to have broth, the 3rd lady did it the best, the guy is 2nd, the dry lady with the great hair needs some ramen school or something.
it was so dry it was stuck to his spoon
I put cabbage onion pickled ginger pickles or cucumber and radish .soya sauce rice vinegar so yummy 😋 ramen supposed to be like soup not dry
If it doesn’t have any juice in it I’m done!!!
The cheetah girl didnt even eat it and gave it a 2
Cheyenne can get it 👌
▶• ılıılıılıılıılıılllI 0:69
This video got me upset. Ramen should not be dryyy
What’s wrong with just tapatío or Valentina and lime
Atagoogoo girl. Lol
huh none of these peopole like broth in their ramen?? most ramen has some kind of broth of juice in it this is crazy i understand if you like it with less liquid but like tollaly dry like like this?😅
Why they gotta hate on eachother like that😂
WHO IN THE FUCK EATS RAMEN WITH A FUCKING SPOON!SO FUCKING ANNOYING.!
Embarrassing
why everyone ramen dry i cant do that i like the soupy shrimp one
''They were wrong by cooking period'' lolll😂😂😂
Olu Trying to roast and hating both the ramens and giving them low scores then hers ain't even cooked fully 😭  5:28 "To make sure I'm not eating anything bad, y'know" GIRL- THEY HAVE YOU T R I E D YOURS, L O O K E D AT YOURS???
I wonder have they ever ate out at a ramen shop before? Like a ramen shop ran by asian people, not no white ppl or sum😭 Cus if you go get LEGIT ramen it has hella broth/soup, egg in it, fish cake, so many sides tbh. So I wonder if they'd sit there and criticize it because their idea of ramen is different   Like the one dude said "does this have cheese?". I've seen some people make ramen with cheese in it.
Cheetah girl boosted my ego and confidence , thank you cheetah girl.
Ramen is supposed to have broth if you went to a ramen place and bought some it would have broth
Complaining about wet noodles is absurd, the water/soup is literally where the flavor resides. Second hand embarrassment, I grew up with my noodles being DROWNED in water so seeing someone not like it is weird to me.
BLKS NEED TO STICK TO ebt CHICKEN
Imagine tasting ramen that a broke culinary student makes 😍
Damn they all sumn haters
yall only talking about  the girl but the guy talking so much smack
Imagine being named after a city in the state that is your last name 💀
i put a boiled egg in mine or lime and chamoy
"this is just dry" nah look at yours bro 💀
I just put a heck load of lemon
What happened to the broth the best part
Ive never seen two dumber people 💀😭
Their ramen looks disgusting. You need broth and an egg at minimum
i hatE ALL THREE
Isn’t ramen supposed to be wet 🙄
These are all awful Jesus
ok i dont know how you mess up INSTANT ramen like literally middle schoolers can cook better than this
I find it hilarious when people say the ramen is too wet. Ramen is a soup. It's noodles and broth. That's why the one with the broth won.
Ramen is supposed to be soup.....if it got no "water" it's not considered ramen🤦🤦🤦
I am from 🇳🇬
Bro Ramen supposed to be wet Who likes dry Ramen
So only black college students are black?
Why do black people love their ramen dry ash, do we realize it's a noodle and BROTH meal? Out here looking uncultured
the chopped off piece of brick looked so good 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖
Bro this bitch with the Afro be feeling herself to damn much like calm down
As a Nigerian I don't claim girl in the cheetah print ☠️😭
the way all of them look inedible
put me on this, ill win for sure
As an asian this made my blood boil
taught how to make ramen by the wrong people
"it looks a little wet" do you know what fucking ramen is?
who would have fucking guessed that ramen with water is better
I hope Ms Nigerian Spices saw this video
Those girls should be models! They’re absolute dolls
I could make better ramen with my eyes closed and I’m 12 😂
Ramen is supposed to have broth!🤦🏽‍♀️
Yes, there are many  types of ramen or at least noodles. I live in Asia, and you will find dry ramen as commonly as soup based ramen. There are even snacks where people prefer to just break then noodles into pieces in the bag and add the seasoning and eat it like chips (Mamee noodles). As much as I love both dry and soup, dry does not mean sand dry! It still has a glossy sauce to it and it aint supposed to clump up like the noodles shown in this video! It is very entertaining to see how students put a twist to their budget noodles. Cheetah print probably had an acquired tastebud from where shes from (im assuming nigeria from the seasonings) and im not sure but maybe if they have noodles they eat it dry? Not sure then again im lazy to do research. In american culture when I visit all I can think of for soup is tomato soup lmao, and there are sure no noodles in there! But pasta is more common right? Pasta is considered "dry" but cheese, milk, and eggs are suuuper expensive right now! Like Im hoping the ramen packets you buy come with the seasonings already right?? not just the pure noodles. just cook it, leave the water in, and just pour inthe seasonings and mix! add a egg in the process, let it cook but not fully harden. You got protein and flavour! If you happen to like it dry you can use the noodle water to cook some veggies like mini bok choy, saves water! its just startchy water. Then you can use the vegtable water once cooled down to water plants or something. I reccomend you dont add all seasoning though because its really really not good for you. i know we all know, but i reccomend you dont.  anyway, safe cooking!   (also, try instant udon it lighter and less salty for me)
my asian ass 11 year old self did better then this
*The producers trying to hold their laughs while filming*
They went wrong by cooking. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me as an Asian watching this:.😶
You csnt cook ramen ahead of time and bring it anywhere. You have to make it and eat it immed. No matter how u make it.
I’d bring my creamy cheese ramen.  These people annoyed me sm, like they’re just eating just plain noodles, even little me who just threw a little water and the seasoning of a package itself was a better cook.
“I prefer my ramen a little more dry” Yh no shit-
The nigerian girl made no sense. How you say its salty than say it got no flavor? And who dafuq is out here cooking dry ass noodles?? RAMEN is a SOUP, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE HAVE A BROTH ITS SUPPOSED TO BE WET lmao 😂 glad cheyenne won at least her had some broth in it
ramen is a SOUP 😭😭 like what
Cheyanne >>> the other two
bro like who doesn’t keep the water in noodles lol it’s essential not to much and not to little
Yeah the ramen is a bit Watery cause it meant to be ☠️
Where the Asian at
She was talking all that shit just to make clumped ramen 😂😂😂😂
Have any of them even ate real ramen ONCE?? Or do they know what soup is??
They can just buy some instant ramen and throw some cheese and rice cakes in there but nah they just wanna act like chefs like bruh all of them, their ramen looks pale soggy dry and all of the above
Bro these people don't know what broth is☠☠
I wanted to see Olu's reaction to finding out her ramen is actually nasty. Bet she got real pissy about it.
How you loud and yo food trash 🗑️😂😂
I don't know what any of these are doin cause I don't see any broth anywhere.
Why are they eating it with a spoon
Imagine making crappy ramen while also being a huge hypocrite of other peoples lmao..
I'm gonna be honest, even a regular cup of noodles looks better than any of their ramen.
2:41 not her calling it dry when all of them have water
Dude how tf do you NOT know how to BOIL WATER 😭😭😭
Most likely would eat the last girl ramen
That girl was literally worried about colour lol
Fuuji
Bro the one girl thinkin she can cook me “GUYS UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES LET HER COOK”
Shes like" SEASON YOUR RAMEN THE RAMEN MATTER" WHen hers wasn't even cooked fully.
Add aromat, it will fix their noodles 😂
oh god where did u even find them
why is there no soup
Goddamn I feel so good about my ramen cooking skills now
i don't think they ever had real ramen lol
Ramen is suppose to have water in it

I feel so good about my cooking mine has some juice some sauce some flavour some fucking colour😭and I dint add nothin special or expensive
wheres the asians at😂? yall know they would’ve pulled out the sesame oil, chili paste, green onion real quick
this is really concerning that even kylie jenner or whoever can make better instant ramen. and hers isnt good either.
It seems like they actually liked the last but they just trying to be mean💀💀
None of them can cook if they can’t make ramen the right way lmaooooo I’m gagging looking at this dry ramen
isnt ramen supposed to be soupy
Why did I watch this
this whole video is a big no and y’all need to re-do this whole video again with people who actually know what ramen is.
"I prefer my ramen a little more dry,"  WHAT
Cheyenne was so nice while Marcus and Olu were soooo disrespectful towards her 😭 Love Cheyenne
It’s always the ones with the worst dishes who grade the toughest 😂
olu trying yo be nigerian so bad lol "ata goon goon"  (I'm nigerian btw)
the dude wins
i like my cereal dry.........
i hope cheetah girl reads these comments lol
i dont like the nigerian girl
I came back to see what girl in the black put in hers she inspired me ❤

"shout out to the shrimp that saved the day" Girly ur day wasn't even saved saved then😂
BROTH!? Bruh wheres the other half of the whole ramen it needs liquid to slurp
Can’t even make noodles is crazy
Actually they all are pretty
Olu look’s like a doll 🖤🤍🖤
As if broke college students can’t make food good. Like where was your homebody teachings at?
The crunch lmaooo
everyone criticizing The kids MEANWHILE IM JUST MAD HERE FOR THE FACT THAT THGEY GAVE THEM A SPOON A DARN SPOON TO EAT RAMEN. WHO EATS RAMEN WITH A SPOON?????
bruh the guy is so confused with his life. "I said too much, its actually pretty good" the next second: "forget everything I said in the first bite"
It looks so nasty imo
CHEETAH  GIRL NEEDS TO SHUT UP
“The ramen matters”  Proceeds to leave part of ramen uncooked.
They were all annoying as hell. The crop top girl saying "ewww, ewww" like a fucking 5 grader. Shut yo ass up, jeez.
i like my ramen with a little bit of hot water so to keep them nice and warm plus so they dont go dry as fast
lmaooo no way she was bragging about that stank ass undercooked ramen shit looked like crackers fr lololol
This video was painful to watch tbh
I would just like to say to all the dry ramen noodle people. The package literally says Ramen Noodle SOUP!! 😭
so extra for ramen(talking about walmart cheetah)
id rather show up with vup noodles 💀
Yall need to chill in the comments making mountains out of molehills
dawg if they had just followed the instructions on the packet and chosen an actual branded ramen instead of some cheap one maybe it wouldve been better
when your eating the so called a ramen with a spoon is it ramen at that point?
cheetah print girl got HUMBLED
thy all some clowns how do u fil t making ramen wtf and then  they talk so much shit like if theirs is any better EMBARASSING
Tbh, I LOVE OLU'S CURLY HAIR SM
This taught me that confidence isn’t key thanks.
I hope this is staged 😭💀
That cheetah print girl oof 🤦🏼‍♀️ lol you got what you deserved there sis lol
Isk why the making it so0 bad likw just go get the 99 cents indo mi noodles at the local store-
Not ulo or whatever saying 5:38 but was saying 2:45

“There’s no way this is fancy ramen.” What-😐
This whole video is just chaos
why does nobody put broth in their ramen?
who puts chucks of whatever in their ramen cheetah girl is rude and disrespectful-
BRUH thats uncalled for, BROKE college kids? 😭
Cheetah girl acting like jamie oliver and got givin a 2💀
Who wants ramen dry I need my water in it 😂

Slim Jim’a cut em up into pieces then do yo lil extras. Recipe by Glockmademan
This shit looks dry as hell. Lol
Yall did her dirty with that thumbnail
Are yall eating ramen with a spoon??
Damn- I thought I was bad at cooking- I know some 8 year olds who can make better ramen than that
How do you go wrong with ramen hELP
the cheetah girl pisses me off  shes never even had proper ramen 😂😂
3:12 "this shit look dry as hell 🙃"
😢 broke college students! 😂😂
I make chow mein with ramen & I served it to my friends who said it tastes really good, so moral of the story: it's okay to fail some classes in order to learn how to properly feed yourself.
How do none of these people know ramen is supposed to have broth.  This is my ramen recipe if anyone wants to try:  Broth: boil water and add 1-3 tsp of old bay seasoning and add the flavor seasoning packet. Then add your ramen in, the reason you add the seasoning in first is to make sure that the ramen absorbs all of the flavor. Btw, make sure that the water only just covers the ramen so as to avoid too much broth and the need to remove some because broth is flavor.  Then make two eggs with salt and pepper, sunny side up and covered to cook the top with steam, and cook it in oil, only remove once the top is white and not like jelly but make sure the yolks are still runny.  After chop up some scallions or Chinese chives and add them in, make sure the are thin to maximize surface area and therefore flavor.   Drizzle sriracha over the egg but don’t add too much because too much spice dulls overall flavor.  And for the sauce: mix 1 part honey, 1 part sesame oil, and 3 parts soy sauce, feel free to add chili oil as well for more flavor.
Marcus is so cute to me .
"It has water in it"  "It looks like it got flooded" Ramen's a soup!! Do they think ramen's a pasta dish? Wow.  When I make ramen I leave all the broth in it and add some leftover chicken and veggies.
They never had ramen with soup before😭
...
How did all three mess up ramen.  It's ramen.
do a Asian lool
how she say its salty then she say it aint got no flavor ????????????????🤔
I feel like it’s also just preference. Like mine looks like an herbal soup sometimes bc I just like the taste of herbs with soup. But I’ll also go dominicana on that shii too💀
Can y’all redo this I loved the video I just don’t think ANY of them know how to cook let alone cook ramen😭 like nothing looked appealing and they all messed up such a basic thing.
I could really go for some fucking ramen right now.
5:37 GIRL WE KNOW😂😂
Ayoo *chetah girl* seems like she would *bully ppl* ... in her head, bc she’d be busy getting bullied for her old untamed *Bob Ross trim*                    (not in a racist way I mean it like u can tell she didn’t rlly style her hair properly so it looks old fashioned and messsy, instead of fluffy and bouncy)
*iM A nEuR0sCiEnCe mAj0r* so ur telling me u can do *neuroscience* but not *read a ramen packet, gurl BYE* 🤡 💀
5:36 Looks at *correctly made ramen*  *HmM, I lIkE mY rAmEn dRy*  .... yh like the *Sahara desert* 💀 🤡
why are they all black?
Why would you waste money on books? get pdfs
Lets all take a moment and ask why their eating their ramen with SPOONS
tHeRe's nOt enOugH sHriMp  They forgot we talking broke college kids here?
If you try to make Ramen with cheese, you should leave water in the end and then put some cheese and mix it. It will be awesome.
ramen watery? you mean like how its supposed to be?
" It looks like it has water in it, looks bit watery. "  Her Ramen: DRYYYYYYYYYY Me: that's what Ramen Supposed be- SOUPY, NOT DRY AND CLUMPY.
Why inroll in college if you are broke
dawg...
watching this video is actually painfully funny, ramen is NOT bricks straight from the packet 😭😭 ramen has a broth or soup that is packed with flavour, or dry ramen is stir fried and at least they’re cooked noodles, not chunks lmaoo  i get that ppl crush the noodles in the bag and add the seasoning packet to eat as a snack (like monster noodles) BUT CMON… the cheetah print girl has got to humble herself
am i the only one that actually keeps broth for the ramen????????
Notice how they all black the producer knew what they were doing 💀
why does marcus sound like chris griffin
All of them looked wrong💀 could of at least added some green onions or something for garnish 😭😭
the one who was confident got fucked up that why overconfident kills
she said it was good but gave it a 3?
Olu is so toxic
Why did they give them spoons to eat it??
I think cheetah girl is just trolling us.
The island girl tooo much!! DONT EAT NOTHING WITH NOODLES FROM ISLAND PEOPLE THEY TRASH AT IT!!  I promise they will always have Mac and cheese squares hahahah!!
I don’t like Judging people but shawty was annoying nd ignorant asf
Ramen needs the broth for more flavor why was there ramen so dry
Are they eating noodles with a SPOON?! 💀
What does he expect y’all broke college students and he wants more shrimp 😂
lol the third one was the best they actually know how to make ramen and understood the assignment
As a Nigerian  citizen  I am  disappointed
This shit seemed played out, it’s like I knew exactly who was gonna win and who was gonna completely bomb…at making noodles
girl all these ramen looks like shit never let them cook again
The fact she said low rating off looks is crazy considering it’s college ramen💀
Cheeta girl talk a lot of trash for being mid😂
Cheeta girl got too much time on her hands saying everything is bad🗿🍷
“It’s watery” BRO ITS CALLED BROTH
I wouldn't put chicken or any of that,  What I do is cook a ramen(chicken, beef, shrimp, etc.) Once the flavor packet has been added I cook it well till the noodles are ready, take out the broth, add Sriracha sauce, sprinkle lemon or lime.
it doesnt need to be colorful girl and ramen is watery its broth bffr
Africans seem like haters
tbh everything looked nasty asf
Thought my cooking was bad until i saw this video, all 3 of them had the deadest ramen i ever seen.
2:06 😂😂😂
I know Marcus ain't saying someone's noodles is dry 😂
It’s always the one who hates more getting a low review
5:12 the looks like 1 to me
I hate how Cheetah print commented about his noodles being dry when she said multiple times that she liked her noodles dry like make it make sense
I wish I was delusional as that girl was.
The cheetah print girl had to be the most rude person I've meant she's hating on others ramen but look at yours making bricks 💀
I’m coming with a different taste, I’m gonna win   “This sh*t look dry ash”😂😂😂
Why they eating noddles with a spoon
This video is horribly produced. First of all why is there only 3 contestants? There needs to be more to actually have a good competition on the ramen. Second of all why are all of the ramen without soup?!? Is that just a coincidence?? And why are they given SPOOONSSSS dude. SPOONS. Everything in this video just ticked me off my apologies. Also it would be more fair if somebody else tested all of the ramens and rated them out of 10 without knowing the individual. I feel like the three of them were VERY biased towards their dish and it just wasn't fair or entertaining to see.
nothing can BEAT my aunts ramen
Girl in the cheetah print needs to calm down...
So today I cringed the most at this.
I swear I got so mad at the fact that they didn’t finish-
“Come on guys it’s ramen” “This is too salty”-“mine has flavor” All that on the first bowl and hers suckeddddd, ramen has to be soft! And a Little liquid, it’s soup dumb asss.
Why is the cheetah print girl embarrassing herself 😭
they need to be HUMBLED cuz …😭😭😭😭
Please redo this with people who actually know how to make ramen 😭
Bro got humbled faster than light
how do you not like liquid in your ramen.. like without broth, ramen is just noodles.. i get that it's instant ramen college struggle meal vibes but stilllllll
That boy came over dramatic when he said that it looks like it was on the street and there is a whole tsunami
You know the one who talked all that smack came in last😂😂😂😂
"This is so salty, are you trying to kill me?" "This has no flavor, season your ramen."  Alrighty then.
Cheeta print was not the vibe at all. sis said she doesn't want to eat anything bad, while her ramen was solid
you can tell ain’t none of them have ever had real fuckin ramen…. cause if they had then they’d know ramen is a damn soup
ain’t none of theirs looked good and i thought i’d be biased cause i’m asian but … looks like the comments also agree
"You gotta put shrimp throughout the whole thing" who can afford that? Seafood isn't cheap. I'd use an egg, a bit of spice, a bit of cheese, *and leave some fucking broth*. Simple, inexpensive, 2$ max.
Y'all ain't got shit on my noodles 🤣 cuh!
“I said too much it’s actually good” these two who lost are people who love to talk out of their ass
Cheetah print : oh my god this is dry!! 2 stars!  Her 2 seconds later : I like my ramen kinda dry so…
why are they all black
Do…do they not understand ramen is a soup and is *SUPPOSED* to be in water??? Also, aren’t ya’ll supposed to eat it with a fork and or chopsticks?
I don’t like all the water, bruh it’s suppose to have broth
THE BROTH IS THE BEST PART
The broth is the whole point of ramen, they don't get it
Who drains their ramen That's so weird Where's the flavor no broth?
Why is everyone shitting on them for making their noodles with less water? Fucking relax, it's like a 50 cent pack of noodles let them do what they want to make it taste better.
Now eat fried chicken and leave a lot of meat on bones so they feel the same
I hate it when people that cant even cook the most simple meal of all time tries to criticize someone else’s cooking.😑
This is so painful to watch
I cannot even with the girl in cheetah print she got me over here pissed off
I love the title broke collage students😂
Idk man the water and the spice packet is all you really need to be adding.   If you microwave it for 2.5 - 3 minutes you just gotta wait for the right texture.  The longer you wait the more the noodles will absorb the water.   My point is how on earth did those noodles stick and clump like that?
First of all, y’all fr gave them a spoon for ramen 😭
Sis with the shrimp great job as that is how Ramen is supposed to look with water and not dry. African girl disappointed bigggg time and our guy great job as well 😊
"It's salty like... are you tryna kill me?"  A few seconds later...  "The only thing that has flavor is the chicken... like season the ramen, the ramen matters"  -Cheetah print girl
The fact that olu had thee sheer audacity to talk about everyone else’s food like I knew hers would be the worst
Asians, let's show them how it's done. 😎
I like my roman a little bit more dry
why are you eating ramen with a spoon🐽
as someone who is a culinary major this broke my heart </3 just google packet ramen recipes you'll probably find some great ones
Man.. I feel kinda bad now. I was like "Ooh no, youre talking too much 💩 animal print girl, I hope your ramen is nasty!" Then hers was God awful and looked half raw. Even the guy was kinda judgemental, "it needs more shrimp." The point was to make BROKE college student ramen. No college student has money for a whole bag of shrimp in a single packet of ramen. These kids need to use some green onions, or sautéed bell peppers before then come back and talk about ramen. P.s. Ramen has BROTH! It's not supposed to be dry. 🤢
These are so fake its unreal. Always the same story
cheatah print girl made me so upset
i personally LOVE the ramen broth. and idk what was up with the nigerian girl but she was WAYY over confident, i make better ramen than those wtf.
Lol my mom would kill me if i presented her ramen without at least 1/3 of the bowl being water
All of these ramen dishes are a mf CRIME
The scariest part of this whole thing is fact that they're eating the ramen with a spoon.......
its always the person who is the most confident that loses in these videos
yuck, no ramen for me i dont care how broke i can be no thnx, i even stopped my kids from eating that,not good for you
"i don't like all the water.." do NONE OF THEM KNOW HOW TO MAKE RAMEN. THIS CANT BE REAL LMFAO
cheeta girl taklking about "this ramen is too watery" thats litterally a normal amount of broth maybe seems like a lot FOR YOU because you like you microwave it dry or sum cause that shit look like bricks.
firts off cheeta print girl needs a reality check and second not me thinking the circle at the bottom was him reacting and wondering why he was smilling while receving insults
instant ramen at walmart for 35 cents:
Making it normal it's good lol yall adding ain't it lol unless u know how to make a spread and no lol
rasmen is soup? no?
where are all of the White people.  kinda lacking diversity here
The first one where the Nigerian girl said that she dose not 2:26 like it.I was like says the person who is broke😂
Me at 14 and my ex friend at 12 could cook better ramen taste also why tf does looks matter it’s food just eat it 😃
These people consider themselves COLLEGE STUDENTS?! Why are they not smart enough to boil their f*cking noodles?!!! As a noodle and ramen lover myself, this really is a crime!!!
She’s going to pepper that noodle to death. As a Nigerian woman, I don’t even make my own noodles with all that spice and crayfish 😂
all these look nasty asf how broke is yall
Food always fire when you broke cause you be hungry than a mf
Damn the cheetah print girl’s noodles was so atrocious they didn’t even let her explain what was in it 😂
I've never seen someone try to eat ramen with a spoon.
I wouldnt eat any of those😭 It’s painful to watch this
Bruh actual ramen is a soup. You can make other stuff with it but it ain't "ramen" at that point more ramen adjacent. Edit: One pack of ramen with two cut up hotdogs and 1 cup frozen vegetables is enough soup for two people. Who the fuck can afford chicken and shrimp in college?!?
i hope bro knows ramen is suposed to have broth in it lmao
Where is the water?
"This is Salty" Bruh
None of their ramen looks appealing one bit
How do you mess up noodles literally anything goes with it Hotdogs or sausage  Cheese or eggs  Hot sauce or no  hot sauce  Either way noodles are almost impossible to ruin. Beside putting to much seasoning
don't call this ramen why is there no soup and why are they eating it with spoons... not even forks??? let alone chopsticks???
Ramen suppose to have water like 😂
theyre so meeeaann to each other's ramen lol <//3 glad the shrimp ramen won tho
bro. it's just noodles. I've never seen anyone cook ramen or noodles like those dishes before. I'm so confused. Those all look trash, respectfully. xD
the gorl that won deserved it and the others were just delusional af
bro i'm Filipino and lived in Japan ramen is suppost to have the water thats why they give the msg pack so they can make a quick broth which is literally why its called instant ramen, ramen without broth we call that pancit canton search it up its just noodles with vegies and seasoning
can anyone tell me if olu's has Nigerian spices ? i didnt hear her the 47th time my audio messed up.
Ramen is too watery? Ramen’s supposed to be in soup
The one that talked the most shat is the one with the most dry and ugly Ramen 😭😭
do they not know that ramen is supposed to be a soup?
The fact that there are 5 star restaurants dedicated to making ramen perfectly and Olu and Marcus think its normal to NOT have broth in their soup is criminal.
Bring a korean. game changer.
Nothing infuriates me more than watching two of them complain about how there was broth with the noodles. Who in the fresh hell eats ramen (which is a noodle soup btw) and takes with no broth? Do you seriously enjoy eating dry-ass noodles with just spice/flavor packets on it???
Ts aint ramen
Ya'll li'l bitches
spoon....
personally... I wouldn't eat ANY of these ramens like bro that aint ramen no more, the only edible looking one is cheyenne's bffr with me
I CANT WITH THE CHEETAH GIRL
the way old said that chicken was just an accessory but later she says the shrimp saves the day?.. ok then 🤣
shut up like i get it u use different spices my god
how do ppl fail instant noodles this bad
what are these people calling ramen??? just boiled noodles with some seasoning?! dry, no water, excusemeeeeee.
The cheetah print girl is a petty stuck up b*tc*
First off- yes Good, real Ramen should have a broth. However instant ramen with cheap ingredients? The seasoning packet will never make a “good “ broth, so less broth is better. However SOME is still needed. Lol What they are all missing tho is some kind of fat added. A little pasta water and then butter, egg, mayonnaise, or American cheese will make a thicker sauce.
i now hjave a grudge against Cheyenne she called Ramen, Pasta. Like no just no
I get this was 2years ago but they don’t seem to realize that ramen is supposed to have broth and what they were making is noodles not ramen. And why are they eating with a spoon? Like use a fork at least but I don’t judge.
this is embarrassing to watch.
Bro really said remen
Who eats ramen with a spoon?
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ARE EATING RAMEN W/ A SPOON OR IS THAT A SPORK
The first question is… Why are they eating ramen with a spoon? (I don’t that’s why I’m saying this)…
Only some people know what shakesauce did to them
im sorry but it bothers me how they are eating the ramen with a SPOON
yall fully strain your ramen😟...
ramen is supposed to be watery not dry 😭😭
BROKE in the caption is Ode 😂
Why do they have spoons???
Me and Cheyenne has the same name 😂😂
Olu really started to gatekeep Ramen while she doesnt even know how to boild it 💀💀
why the fuck they eating with a spoon...
Ok I want to know how many people leave the water in the bowl. Cause it might just be a weird thing for others because I do
"the ramens a little watery* MISS GIRL ATLEAST IT AINT UNDER COOKED
How do you physically fuck up noodles
some japanesse pass through and says that call this ramen its disrespectfull, they are instant noodles
Dude so no joke as a kid I would smash up dried ramen noodles, toss it with the sauce packet. Snack to go. Very bad for you more than instant ramen is already for you. Advice: Save up some money and into a Ramen shop. There in more places than you'd think
What was she thinking
my broke version is to just boil it with some bacon (precooked or raw if you don't mind chewy/soft, or just the bacon fat) and add a poached egg and a slice of american cheese on top. bacon egg and cheese ramen!
... I honestly didn't know people like their ramen cooked but dry asf...
dude why was all the ramen so colorless? what.
atp y'all don't even know what ramen is just throwing some random noodles
the cheetah girl  😭😭😭
I have no Idea what that girls name is suppose to mean but she definitely has to change her name right away, try writing your name on an employment contract your employee will just give you a funny look and just turn you down until you come up with a name that everyone could say and also spell.
As an asian, i cringed way too much watching this
Wow, what a bunch of miserable haters. I must've missed it, but I did not hear a single positive comment given to another person.
I’m way better tbh💯
For being a "broke college student" the cheetah print girl seems real picky.
WHAT IS THIS RAMEN- And the fact that they looked at it weirdly when it had soup in it- Like original ramen is supposed to have soup- AND WHAT WAS THAT DRY THING- i mean i cant judge, before tasting it, but damn. Ive never seen ramen made like that  (Also could they just use a spice pack from the ramen pack. Or did they need to make it themelves?) But uhm yeah, they tried atleast.
Why do two of them throw out the tasty broth? They're broke ass college students and the broth is one of the nicest, most filling parts of ramen...
i cant with how they kept talking about the water when ramen is supposed to have broth ☠️☠️
cheyenne one is actual ramen… all of theirs suck they cannot be talking
CHEETAH GIRL NEEDS TO BE HUMBLED
honestly you should do this again but make your sample more representative, like use stratified sample in or something so it represents different types of college students from ethnicity, so different ethnicity’s and showing their broke college food lol, because this is very biased and does not represent all college students as the minorities are only one race
NONE OF THEM CAN MAKE RAMEN RAHHH🔥🔥🔥
I can see cheetah girl’s smile decaying as the other students judge her meal 💀
“Like, are you trynna kill me? 😭” stfu gurl. you ain’t talking with that clumpy musty dusty rusty dry ramen that looks like it was buried in the badlands for centuries.
they have something in common tho,              they have noses
Cheetah print girl, what? "It's too salty are you trying to kill me" "The only thing that has flavor in this is the chicken" So is it too salty or flavorless? Is there flavor or not miss? LOL
Tf do black people know about ramen?
big hair girl gives me ice spice vibes
Hmmm well here's my fav way to make ramen!: I use half the seasoning packet. Add ins: 2-3 oz rotisserie chicken meat, some garlic powder, bit of slivered yellow or sweet onion, 1 tbsp butter.  I cook noodles al dente (about 2 minutes), then slowly pour and whisk in 1 well beaten egg into soup right before serving. 😙👌
She came in talking pro chef and got a 2
Ramen is too salty, season the Ramen
What in the holy Jesus is happening over here???
Its not water its soup or broth 😭😭
jesus fuck these people are stupid
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE JUICE TF
"the ramen is a bit watery"  Nah bro there's supposed to be broth in ramen
all 3 look nasty
Miss cheete print needs to chilll that’s why she lost
i’m fr about to stop watching these bc they don’t show the contestants reactions to winning/loosing & the ratings they received. they literally leave us on a cliff hanger. i feel like it’s common sense as a youtube channel to give us closure.. not just end the video. i literally love these videos but i get a attitude every time the video ends too early 😒 am i the only one???
Wow all three of them are pathetic.
Omfg just eat it y’all eat doin too much it’s just ramen
she was calling everybody else food trash and shittalking now look at her 😂 karma and the girl who was being humble got the best score. Crazy
any asians dying when the cheetah print girl said " i like my ramen dry" ;( i sure was dying
oml the cheetah print girl reviewing the first bowl she said it was too salty AND that it had no flavor bffr
I love how the one who has so much to say is usually the one evryone hates 😂
“They were wrong for cooking it period”had me dead because she was so confident then it turned out nasty and clumpy af moral of the story make sure you actually know how to make ramen before judging others and getting the lowest rating 💀
so i guess nobody liked the cheetah girl 💀
The fact you can actually tell they liked the last one but tried to bring it down just  by looking at it 😭
Cook noodles Al dente  Strain, blanch with cold water  Pan fry minimally with butter  Add seasoning , chili powder , black pepper, franks red hot , parsley  Done ✅ 😂😂😂
bro why is that olu girl talking like shes writing a poem 🤣🤣
Not enough shrimp ?! She was literally broke this ain't just made for you 😭
BRO WHAT U MEAN TOO WATTERY YALL SHOULDNT EAT RAMEN IF U DONT KNOW HOW TO EAT IT
what an embarrassment to the asian community bro. how do they call it ramen but have no broth in it? some egg and seaweed and some green onions woulda made a great ramen. ramen isnt dry it has broth
“Why is there water in the ramen..” bro ramen is a noodle soup dish….
I hate this so much. 😂 I hate their attitude, I hate that they’re eating ramen with a spoon, I hate that they’re roman is dry AF and when one has TINY bit of water in it they’re like “um it’s watery 🥴” lmao this shit it too funny but like. Sad funny
it is quite clear none of them have ever seen actual ramen in their lives...
this video is all sorts of fake and is a big FU to the peopel who actually struggled in college.
as soon as i heard the girl say ruhmen i knew she had never known the struggle
2:26 THE EYE ROLL I CANT EVEN
All they ramen look nasty and dry
The most dry you can make instant ramen legally is so the SAUCE clings to the noodles.  Any dryer than that and you'll be arrested by the ramen police. I said what I said.
Why do people like it dry I find it 10x better with water in it it makes it way more juicy
Who gave them spoons 💀
Whoooo tf eats noodles w/ a spoon 🙄
They do realize ramen’s a soup ain’t it 🤨
Is there even water in their ramen...💀
Ramen is a noodle soup and to these two who say it’s too watery you don’t know what ramen is
What “broke” collage kid has shrimp seafood ain’t cheap
This Afro girl pissing me off
Moral of the story: everyone loves their ramen different, but mine is better
“There’s not enough shrimp” Me: read the title of the video
Isn’t ramen supposed to be watery
What kind of Ramen are the students eating when they say don’t like is watery ramen? It’s supposed to be in water..

how tf do you even make dry ramen😭😭 it's supposed to have a broth
All of their ramen is trash. Mine can beat all of their ramen.
When your going to be a broke college student but you can’t eat gluten or you’ll die.
Ramen doesn’t “save the day” it literally doesn’t digest in your system..
Bro wtf they act like ramen is supposed to be dry
Who decided too gives them spoons wit noodles

"it has water in it"  "like i don't like all the water" IT'S RAMEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BROTH THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE FLAVOUR IS. at least girlie's ramen had some moisture in it unlike the other two😭
None of these people know how to make ramen.
Cheetah girl was like “I prefer my ramen to be a little more dry-“ yeah we can tell😭
you ugly! PLEASE LET THIS FOR ASIAN AND EUROPEAN PEOPLES! YOU DONT LIKE IT EITHER!
problem 1 is the brick ramen noodles no 2 is the Cocoa Butter giving them spoons to eat ramen.
y'all know ramen is a soup, right???
Rename video to haters try ramen lmao
so they cook ramen then bring it.
Man I make better ramen than all of em and I’m 11!?
All of them suck at cooking ramen, none of them reminded me of actual ramen, they were all dry and weird
“the ramen matters  not to you apparently
They need better people for this because I don't understand their concept of ramen

Is it only me or 2 of them were rude ?? Anyhow , who's gonna tell them that ramen usually are coming with soup?
This is absurd!!!!!!
The made chow mein.  And first she said it was to salty and then that it’s not seasoned 😂
i knew cheyenne would win bc miss girl's ramen looks more apetizing then olu's and marcu's tbf 😭 sorry but its the true and she was also a sweetheart like god bless cheyenne ^3^
Do they not know ramen is supposed to have soup in it?? That's what makes it ramen, soup, noodle, topping... Like yes you can not have soup, but they legit taking points off for having it when that's how traditional ramen is made 💀
It’s always the one that talks the most mess 😂😂😂
For any kind of ramen, prepare your ramen Coat top with red pepper flakes, pepper, & paprika Boil water Put in eggs & cook them for 8-9 minutes for a soft yolk It's so good & is my go to & it's so creamy-
The Title is so disrespectful 💀
bro how they dont like wet ramen
Cheetah girl was big talk for makin dogshit in culinary form
I don't trust nobody that doesn't have the broth with their ramen. Dry and nasty as fuck without it.
But why can't people be like me just use the packet flavour and eat it no need to hustle adding other stuff
the way the cheetah girl said hers would be the best and ended up the worse mark HAHAHAAAAA 💀💀💀
Ramen is watery? BROOOO CHEYENNE MADE THE RAMEN INTENDING FOR IT TO BE SOUPY BRO NOT ALL RAMEN IS DRY
the reason 2 of these were so shit is because they were dry as hell, and the "water" (broth) is what gives it taste, how are you so bad at boiling noodles???
If your a Mexican you will understand me. Tapito and Lemon
5:43 It's called the fucking broth dumbass. I'm 13 and know what broth is you stupid fuck.
The title is a violation
You guys are ment to be broke htf can you complain about ramen when you a broke college student if you could customize or put what you wanted in your 4amen you wouldnt be called broke
theyre broke yet they really nice clothes?
I’m so damn confused, isn’t ramen supposed to be in a whole ass broth? What are y’all doing? “I like my ramen dry” what the fuck 😂
The cheetah girl said the boy’s ramen was too salty ... then goes into saying it’s dry and unseasoned 😂😂
Y’all want some good ramen find a Mexican 😂 that shit been a meal for my family nd every family I know forever
These guys don't know anything about Ramen, I mean an egg or any type of meat and thought what ever veggies u have   And for God's sake save the broth !!!!!
BBG EATING RAMEN WITH BROTH WATER OR WHATEVER IS THE CORRECT WAY
It’s always the mfs that b talking mad sh!t that makes the worst food lmfao
Why was leopard print girl so confident but her ramen looked so blocky 😭😭
Lol acting like she's some Cordon Bleu critiquing over some boiled noodles... Yet proceeds to bring a brick.🤣

Wait i thought cooking something aldente takes less time and gas
olu got alot to say w that clumpy ass ramen.. “i like my ramen dry” ..
This is a stupid video! They’re all picky eaters
Dry ramen is good if you eat it like chips. You break up noodles in the bag and add some of the seasoning packet and toss it.
Ain’t no way they eating with a spoon
why are they eating it with a spoon 😭
Dude act like water isn’t an ingredient in making the ramen noodles.. lmaooo
naw how I cook better then some grown ppl this video gave me the opposite of tips also the cheetah girl really giving tips
Cheetah wanna be doctor.... take your hits and take some humble pie... you didn't bring it sweetheart. 😆😆
4:36 "at least they tried...like its edible"😭💀
How you make a ramen video with 2/3 people who dont know what ramen is
Jail house spread with the chili cheese fritos is amazing.
honestly when ramen sits the noodles absorb the water and become watery, i think if they made the ramen in the facility the taste would be a lot better !
Cheyanne is the only one who made it right 😭  Do the others just boil it in water drain it then put seasons and let’s it dry
Und ich dachte meine ramen wären schlecht
Why are they eating Ramon with a spoon..
No way Cheeto I mean cheetah shirt girl was saying her’s was good Also black shirt girl was so nice about it she cool
The girl in the cheetah print is annoying
Its like watching 3 blind person critizing each others art pieces.
“I like my noodles to be dry” Yes, yes you do.
My 10 year old sister can make ramen better 😭
The last one had some broth and the rest is super dryyyyy😭😭😭😭
i love cheyennes attitude tbh
The other girl said I am going to get a lot of votes more like 2 votes 💀🥴
As much as I like my Nigerian girl here, why the Raman dry 😭
The afro girl a real hater 😭😂😂😂
I just cook the ramen and put the msg on it (shout out to uncle Roger 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆😀😃
Idk what I hate more, the uncooked ramen in *clumps* or the fact that they’re eating with spoons 😭😂
So B people CANT cook some noodles? ☠️
2:25 2:26 girl like wth water matters what u mean 😭😭
The Bush hair cheetah  girl pronounced ramen  REMEN
Didnt cheetah girl just say it was too salty- then switched up and say "it needs more flavor" LIKE GIRL
Awh man I can finesse tf out some Ramen... being broke u know but If u eva been locked up u got a whole other level to da art 🎨
The last one was one that looked edible to me, can't be having ramen so damn dry man
“Why is it watery?” Have yall never had actual ramen before?
Beggar's Delight: Ramen and Smirnoff
Isn’t ramen supposed to have the soup in it?
Cheetah girl embarrassed herself
Miss cheeta prints was undercooked and overcooked at the same time
The fact my 10yr old little brother can make ramen and eat ramen better than them
A baby could could cook better ramen than this tbh. Ramen should never be dry- even the emoji agrees! 🍜
if it went wrong can we have it for real don't take it wrong but some people just need something to eat if you're broke you don't care to rate it you'll just eat it cause you may not get to for who knows how long?
Y’all be eating noodles with a spoon
Who else feel proud of their Ramen noodles after watching this.
Yall don't use broth or do they not exist when your broke
The jaguar print women was mean and rude and judge mental  The boy was kinda rude and mean  The other women was just kind a nice
As soon as I heard Marcus say “Maruchan” I didn’t like him no more LMFAO
Cheetah print saying “whoever made this tried” BYEE 💀
literally wanna punch cheetah print, why is she so☠️
what college student can afford chicken???
WHY DID Y'ALL LET THEM COOK??????
I really hate that olu chick, the way she critiques others food, is utterly disgusting lmao, especially when her food looks the nastiest out of them all
Black shirt girl ateee

THERES SUPPOSED TO BE BROTH PPL
the problem was they tried to hard to make theres bett er , who puts CHICKEN IN NOODLES?? bffr
she really said it looks grey well no duh its fkn ramen what other color you want
Dude said Raman looks flooded.... my man... don't you know what Raman is supposed to look like? Raman is a SOUP dish.
Why the fuck do they take ALL of the water out. Like I get it, I enjoy ramen that's more like a sauted noodle or pasta meaning not swimming in a broth, but idk man.
yall never had ramen chips? its good good. but cheetah print girl was wack
Wow. What was that. A little welfare cheese and hot sauce can take you a long way I guess…cause my ramen does not look like that, wtf. Ahahaha
noodle and water are like milk and cereal. they are meant to be together. stop eating dry.
this was strange to watch bc you had them bring it as opposed to cooking fresh? the noodles are instant... they're meant to be eaten right away and don't have the structural integrity to be taken to-go
"Broke college students"   All of them are wearing designer clothes
It’s freaking packaged ramen dumb twats
EATING RAMEN WHILE WATCHING
mfs really like dry ramen with no juice
Mf had em eating noodle blocks
Bro only the last girls Ramen looked edible 😭
My name is ouywoiewuoijuioaeuwaa. Wat.???
Who’s cares
Cheetah print girl was so mfing obnoxious lol I couldn't wait for her to lose
Why did y'all find college students who don't appreciate ramen in it's basic form which is in a simple salty broth.
All these ramen look nasty
“To give it color u know make it red , whoever made this tried, next “ the words of the wise cheetah girl
U are suppose to have “water” broth in ramen
Yo am I tripping or am I noticing that people don’t drink the “broth” is what I call it that shit fire,huhhhh???
Ramen is a SOUP dish ... uncultured swine
Yall tripping, I need broth in my Ramen. Cheyenne is the goat.
Take a shot every time she says vibe lol
Cheyenne deserved that win she was so kind and funny❤❤
All of a sudden i feel like my shin ramen with green onion and boiled egg is a chefs masterpiece😂😂
All i can say is my 5 year old sister can cook better
Girl what the cheetah girl mean when she says this needs more color like red like the fu-
Best ramen: - Beef flavored maruchan ramen with 2 (scrambled-ish) eggs cooked into it.
I prefer my ramen with the broth but that’s just me
"it has no colors" huh 😭😭 atleast it aint dry
The-first-girl-was-doing-too-much.Not-respectfully-and-said-things-that-didnt-need-to-be-said.AND-THE-GIRL-AFRICAN?BRO-you-know-our-african-mothers-taught-us-better.
Mine is the best.
Wait what? Do they think ramen is supposed to not have broth??? What do they mean “watery”. Japanese ppl are livid!! Ramen that doesn’t have broth is automatically a zero for me.
How these people are not used to eat ramen with broth, I mean that’s how it’s supposed to be done
LMAO
"my mom is spanish"💀
I hate how they all hate there ramen dry like i like my ramen noodles drowned
Where are the white people? Just curious, no hostility
“Why is it in water?” Oh you mean… broth?
my would have won tho, brothy or fried.
I’m surprised no one put a egg in it.
wait so people eat their ramen dry? 😭
The woman with the braids is the kind of person people wanna be friends with  The woman with afro is the one you should stay away from same with the boy
She said it just dry at Marcus at 2:46  then at 5:40 she said she like dry
Now this is sad when my 7 year old sister can make better ramen
"this is so salty r u trynna kill me or something" "SEASON THE RAMEN THE RAMEN MATTERS" 💀
These ppl just cant cook. How can you be that old and not be able to cook lol smh These ppl complain about ramen being watery...they need to google what ramen is or is it they were too broke for water so they had it dry lol
lmfao why does everyone eat them strained like its not soup nymore its just noodles
Never bring Marcus and Olu back 💀 they don't know what Ramen is.
Ramen with scrambled eggs. 😋
But it ended up being good with the water 💀 they're actually pretty dumb
thats not ramen....thats pasta salad.
on the internet all you see is the racist promotion that black culture knows how to season better than anyone else especially whites....and their food is "better". By this example that theory is very questionable. Ramen is supposed to be in a broth. Im white... and I know I could make a ramen that is 1000 times better....starting with a broth.
ramen traditionally is in a very flavorful spicy broth...hence flavor!!!!  all throughout the mouth hitting every taste bud with a sledge hammer!!!! Dry no good...sad.
Girl boiled rocks
who eats long ramen with a spoon😂
i think they forgot ramen is soup
Am I the only one who view think ramen supposed to be a whole soup and not jus noodles
They really used spoons to eat ramen 💀
They really gave them spoons to eat ramen💀
What I really hate in the first place is that they gave them spoons to eat ramen 💀
The fact that they all struggled to make ramen!!!! That’s terrible 😭
Why the hell they eating ramen with a spoon.
I swear to god it sound like her name was Omai wa mou desu ni
My broke college version would be a cup ramen (so I don’t have to worry abt screwing it up😁) Then throw in random extras from the fridge — an egg, & maybe some cheese, baby carrots, or broccoli — I don’t rly care, whatever I can find lol
Do these kids not understand Ramen is a literal soup. Like it's supposed to have alot of broth- that's the point
“Why is it so watery it looks like a tsunami flooded” how do these college kids not know that ramen is supposed to have water anyway, because that’s literally how its made 💀
Okay… just no. Do this. Maruchan chicken noodles, Ragu brand Alfredo, chili flakes & a slice of craft cheese… doesn’t even need anything else, but you can add shrimp or chicken if you want.
WHERE IS THE BROTH
The insanity of being broke and young and in college is insane.  At 20, I was making money and had my own house that I now paid off.  The insanity they make these kids to think being broke is COOL.
olu needs to chill. every singe time she wasnt even judging their ramen, she just basically said she would add what was in hers, or its bas bc it was missing what was in hers...
Guys... majority  of ramen has water in it... If you went to a ramen shop and said that you would be smacked.
"Remen to save the day" 💀
ramen needs broth!! omg
Man I’m 13 and I can make ten times better chilli oil authentic ramen
Crayfish in noodles? I can understand the pepper but crayfish??? Haba!!! You should have just kept quiet. Turned out you can’t even cook🤦🏽‍♀️
This is just disrespectful
I knew she was gonna be the worst 😂😂
Boy i cook noodles betta then ALL yall 🤣
blac ppl bro smh
how can they eat dry ramen- THE BROTH IS THE BEST PART
ramen is supposed to have broth wtf is they talking bout. I'm embarrassed
not cheetah girl talking about color and " I wouldn't eat it at first sight," like miss gurl u gave those people bricks to eat😭😭
What is cheetah print girl even saying atp😭😭.............Like its called ramen noodle "soup" for a reason, its suppose to have liquid.
Bro i feel bad for Olu, she was talking the most smack about everybodys ramen. and how her ramen was better, but instead she got shit on by 2 people
Try raw cupped ramen 🍜 it's pretty good tho but das jus mines
The girl with the Afro acting like a whole food critic and she can’t even make ramen 😐
None of them make ramen good😂
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A SOUP NOT DRY AS CARDBOARD THESE PEOPLE ARE EMBARRASSING LOLOLOLOLOLOL
not them dissing how ramen is traditionally supposed to be eaten
bro ramen is a soup like what u got against water
…how is this broke ramen with shrimp and chicken in there? We’re operating on a different idea of what it is to be, “broke”😂
thats why i love shin ramyun ❤❤
Why they using a spoon for
Woman ☕️
The broke was not needed 😂
“There’s not enough shrimp” like boy it’s a poor man’s meal. They all be tryna talk s* I hate that 😭
the nigeran girl got me maddd
I would kill to see Olu’s reaction to getting a 2
Cheyenne noodles actually looked good & maybe that’s just bc shrimp is my favorite food 😂😂 but I’d definitely try it.
“ not enough shrimp” my guy the topic is broke college student ramen. Not seafood dinner
These three college students are insufferable.
Everyone's ramen looks dry
looked like it hurt cheetah girl to give that compliment but was real quick to start talking that smack again right after😅
why was the guy surprised the ramen had broth? LIKE BRO, IT'S RAMEN
nah that shit aint even cooked. its like you cooked it for 30 seconds
Olu got humbled
Olu clearly was a very very broke college student couldn't even afford water to properly boil and cook those damn noodles!!!!
As a 12 year old who sucks at cooking, I can proudly say I’m better than all of these contestants because I actually put water in mine
who fails at making some ramen 😭😭
I think people are invited just to disrespect other people's food.
No egg nor seaweed nor pork 😂😂😂
And look at her ramen
Aint no way yall cant cook basic instant ramen noodles tf
BROKE COLLEGE KIDS AHAHAHHQAH
I’d win this.. I watch a lot of ramen cooking videos and I always try out the recipes.. I’ve never made the noodles from scratch but I love adding the ramen egg, spring onions (we don’t call them scallions in Australia) the pork, dumplings, sriracha, I’m good at making my own broth now but that takes a day so I only do it when I’m making a large amount for the family..  I can make them dry and fry them, or wet in soup with a nice broth.. anyway I love ramen, I’m 29 and we have ramen as a family regularly :) we add plenty of fresh meat, seafood and veg so it’s healthier. We love ramen and it’s not just for collage kids lol Anyway we can add soy sauce to we cook a lot of and ramen loves soy sauce! Yummy
2 things that kinda made me  upset  1. No broth for the ramen  2. Why use a spoon to eat ramen it’s meant for a fork or chopsticks ( I respect the dude for using a fork)
I feel so many emotions watching this. But I'm relieved that one of them actually made ramen right. You add the packet to the water, let it boil, add ingredients and seasoning that can be boiled , add the noodles , once the noodles are soft enough to mix and separate pour into bowl. Add cheese if that's your thing.
Watery? Are they still talking about ramen?.
@gaydog u fking feminist and furry 🦆u
No way the cheetah print has to be trolling
The cheetah girl gave a tutorial on how to have second hand embrassment
The fact that ramen is supposed to have broth in it and only one that got it somewhat right💀
If you f don’t want broth try cheese, hot sauce, flavor pack, egg, and cheese after draining it. Only expectable way
WHY DONT THEY WANT BROTH IT HOLDS FLAVOR! THESE KIDS NEVER HAD SOUP OR SOMETHING?
YALL DONT LIKE BROTH??? WTF
“ it looks kinda dead” GIRL YOURS HAD *FRICKING* ROCKS, YOU CAN PUT ME IN THE TOMB THERE AND THEN 💀
So Marcus what are your first impressio- “*Nasty.*
“Ima give it a 2 cus they tired” ~ Marcus “That’s a zero, can I give a zero? *yeah it’s a zero*~ dead meat
*anyone else just wondering why they don’t use the seasoning packets* 😅
How did they not succeed in boiling it-
This entire video was made by people who have never eaten ramen in their lives. Serving with a spoon wtf
The way the lokey  fucked up that last one lol.... they’re some haters lol
2:00 now thats just straight up narcism😭😭😭😭
The water?!?! ITS BROTH YOU UNCULTURED PEOPLE
they way cheetah girl (olu) pronounces ‘ramen’ is irritating It annoys me so much
Nah a 2 is crazy 😭
Olu GOT HUMBLED 😂😂
As an Asian this is too painful to watch. Shoutout to Cheyenne for making proper ramen tho
If Olu had any skills... she should have made jollof ramen...OMG! That ish woulda been good asf!
“ I’m not trying to be mean or anything, but I don’t like this at all. It has to much salt, like are you trying to kill me 😭 ? “ Damn chill, you literally said that you don’t like this at all but it ain’t being mean???
So only one of these kids actually studied something worth while in college.
Why r both of em so judgy😭
At least Cheyanne knows how to make plain ramen better. She knows how to make real ramen 😭
Someone get them on Jin, Shin, and Samyang🥲
They eatin with a spoon💀
Cheetah girl gave many tips and got the lowest score💀  “I prefer my ramen dry” Girl it ain’t cooked
dry ramen??? lmao you kids are nasty
Not tryna be racist but this is why you don’t make black ppl make Asian dishes just like u don’t make Asians make fried chicken
It here is always an asshole in one of these shows
I hate olu and Marcus
🫑🫑🫑🫑🫑🫑

Bruh the title is broke college kids and I see three niggas eating. Nah.
''there's not enough shrimp'' bro this is  Broke College Kids Try Each Other's Ramen what do u mean huhuhuuhuhuhuhuhuhuh
Just boil sum water bruh
Both of them: its a bit watery  The broth: am i a joke to YOU!?😔✋
I didn't know Ramen can be dry. I'm from Asia, and Ramen is a type of noodle soup in Japan. It's the name of the dish. It has to be in a broth/soup. If it's not, it's an entire different noodle dish with different name. The guy even mocked that the noodles are swimming in those tiny amount of broth and called it a flood or tsunami? I would call those Ramen water shortage, drought calamity, and desert dry. There are thousands of different stirfried noodles in Asia, and noodle dish without broth, or sauce, and none are called Ramen. That includes instant noodles or noodle packet. It indicates if it has to be dry or with broth unless you bought the packed instant cooking noodles. Still, it's not called Ramen. Maybe in the west they think instant cooking noodles is called Ramen. That's like saying all Pasta is just Spaghetti in tomato Sauce.
bro none of them know how to make ramen
Bruh Cheyenne Be My Wife!!
"Wdym where did they go wrong!? They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it" I'm actually dead💀
First girl got HUMBLED
Why are they using a SPOON damnit
Marcus really said MARU Chaine
00:45
These kids are obviously broke because they spend all their money on "cool" clothes and expensive hairdos.
my ramen is better ngl
If they don't know broth is supposed to be in ramen they shouldn't be making it 💀
Isn't ramen supposed to be watery?? Like have you guys never heard of broth? Ramen noodle soup?
As an asian.  My eyes are burned seeing this vid☠️☠️☠️☠️  Wth did they do to the ramen the last one is normal and good looking but the 1st and 2nd one... Really pain in my eyes
who else is triggered because they are using spoons for ramen
Ahh haha 😂 that’s is so funny how they broke but black hahaaaaaaa

The Cheetah girl is giving self believing second hand embarrassment vibes 💀
bro wtf thses mfs are in college and dont even know how to make some goddam ramen 😐
I’m sobbing what were the reactions for the last one 😭😭😭😭 “it’s too watery” ITS RAMEN??????! YALL PREFER IT DRY??????????????????
It has WAteRr in it    It looks like it was folded   R U JOKING it’s ramen it literally broth
Where is the broth
When one person ain’t honest
Bro they're eating rocks BCS no water is wild. I literally made my ramen like Cheyennes. It's so good.
“i dont like how its watery” what do you mean, its ramen
Genuinely wanted to through up watching this
First time ever I'm feeling culturally appropriated! "Ramen" is orinally made to be in a soup or broth. Cook it however you want but don't you fking dare say it's "not meant to be this way or that" when you have zero idea what you're talking about and when it's not even yours.
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon? I'm serious, that broke me. I could focus on anything other than "why spoon"
a SPOON....
You suck
Someone nominate me to pull up with the best tamales!!😩😩😩😩👀👀
ITs CALLED SOUP YOu Little piece of-
MF RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WATERY, THAT'S THE FLAVOR
Its fucken ramen soup wtf! Its not stir fry its SOUP. ofcourse its has water its called broth!
“It has watur in it” That, Cheeto, is called broth.
"it's not ramen without broth" they was broke.
Bro this is not ramen
They really got trippie red’s past.
goddamn all of their ramens look horrendous😭😭i was a broke college student as well but i always had some mushrooms and bok choy in the fridge so i’d sauté them with some garlic, and make a soft boiled egg. literally the simplest things can make a dish so much better. if i was feeling fancy i’d add sesame seeds, or canned corn, or if i had the time and energy i’d marinate my eggs beforehand. just cause y’all broke don’t mean your food has to be depressing.
The way the Nigerian girl hyped herself up so much and then everyone hated it
WHY DID THEY GIVE THEM A SPOON?!?! Ughhhhhhhh
Wait? When did ramen become so dry? Have these people even know what ramen is?
I make that fancy ramen idk what they got going on and soggy noodles are trash lol but that clump was crazy😭😭
5:28 speak for yourself ❤
A pinch of Nantucket Offshore Rasta Rub in a chicken ramen is all I need
How hard is it to keep broth inn soup and add an egg with some veggies?
The water at the bottom the best part shorty!! Get with the program euh somebody help her
some koreans eat it raw. like full on raw. you crush it up into small pieces and then add the seasoning packet and shake it up. there’s a literal snack that is popular selling in korea to this day. (btw you should try it because it is amazing 😋 also i’m korean)
The most thing that bothers me is that their using a spooon 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Sesame seed oil, curry powder, chili garlic sauce and stewed tomatoes with a half boiled egg is my recipe. It’s really good :)
so we're really not going to question why they're all using spoons to eat ramen??
These uncultured swines don't know how to cook ramen 😭😭😭😭I'm sorry but please no god no 😭😭
This is what happens when rich kids try and cook ramen lol
Cheetah girl called his dry and hers is literally the driest shit ever lmao   Side note none of them know how to cook ramen lol
Cheetah girl says “The ramen is dry” to Marcus, and proceeds to serve ramen that isn’t even fully cooked 😭😭   Edit: why were they eating ramen with SPOONS for Cheyenne’s ramen!?!?
Cheetah girl think she’s the best she made the worst one
Cheyenne was a true one in this bro
these people are crazy picky
9 year old me could do better than Olu and Marcus
"the raemen matters"
Y’all picky.
Why are they all black
Do people not know that the water belongs in the ramen?
Cheyenne was the best contestant the others were so annoying lmao
i don’t like olu💀
Isn't ramen supposed to have liquid.....???
I couldn’t eat ramen for years after I graduated college. I just started eating it again b
Oh my god. These people . Shout out to Cheyenne for being a decent human and sweet. The others seem like a pain to be around. And that's OVER RAMEN, imagine trying to shop with them.
Try hot sauce and chicken broth fire
Mine isn't like NORMAL, IT HAVE CHEESE AND ITS SPICY
this shit dry as hell had me dying XD
Man these people are all weird. eating dry ass ramen, using a spoon to eat it, mushy noodles, da fuck?
Redo this, that don’t look like ramen, ramen is based on the broth flavoring it 😭😭
ARE THEY USING SPOONS
bruh the last ramen they wear like I d'ont like that I d'ont like this even thought it was the best looking one
I'm dying at "there's too much water" bish it's a soup and there was only like a spoon of liquid in it!
I was really rooting for my Nigerian girl until I saw her noodles😭. It prolly tasted good cause Ik the spices she used but the clumpy dry noodles gave me a jump scare😭
how can all of them messed up instant ramen? like how is that even possible???
Who else just gets top Ramen from the store and puts the seasoning pack in
“And we have rameÂĘùn to save the ✨day✨”    Fr I’m dying of embarrassment 🗿✋
“It’s so salty are you trying to kill me????”  GURl your eating instant noodles it’s supposed to be salty 🤦‍♀️
When you went to uni in Germany: 😅
wtf are these dry as ramen 💀 like ramen is supposed to be in water? oh my god
THIS IS FUNNY AF!!!!  I know I shouldn't be laughing 'cause i can't cook ALOT,but this is just so funny like lmfaooo.Like the way they roast eachother    3:11 "this (beep) looks dry as h*ll",   3:21 "wtf is that" face  3:27 "like a bowl of breadcrumbs"   3:43 the way she laughs and holds the thing LOL😂   4:18 "they went wrong by waking up & making it"  5:34 "nasty" LOL  5:38 "i prefer my ramen a bit more dry" i remember a comment saying "yeah,we can tell sis😂" and nearing her voice say that is just hilarious af   The funniest video I have seen in a while,literally been laughing hysterically next to my mother for 30minutes LMFAO! I do think they would look great as a friend group,they're extremely funny Even tho they're funny ,I gotta admit the last girl (Cheteya I think,the girl in 3:43) was a mature person about the whole situation.
Bro how does the first girl remember her name
Gurl were is the broth it's not ramen without broth or atleast sauce
Nobody is talking about the girl eating the ramen with a spoon?!
mf the guy look like lil tecca😭😭
Bro y’all just need good cooked noodles crack two eggs mix em up in there make sure you got enough broth and you read to go my guy
are they fr eating it with spoons like at least use a fork
Ik I did not just hear cheetah girl say add fish and something else for color…..WHY DO U NEED COLOR FOR RAMEN U WANT YO FOOD TO BE DARK ORANGE? That’s why she got the lowest score keep it simple 😭😭
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE RAMEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY ON??
THE WAY SHE WAS JUDGING THE BOYS FOOD AND HERS WAS CLUMPED UP AND DRY..
cheetah girl is annoying omfg
They way the first girls name is for ever long and then the guy is just like “hey I’m marcus” 😂😂
@megumi fushiguro    I also want to talk about her. I mean she is so mean when she tries Marcus’s ramen like miss girl- at least their ramen is better than yours- and when she rolled her eyes bc his had no ✨flavor✨ like no just no.
LIKE ITS SALTYY???? R U TRYING TO KILL MEE?????
I don’t like water in my ramen but if someone makes me ramen I expect to see water…ramen is suppose to have water😂
Did she Fr say my mom is spanish
I am willing to bet my unborn brother's life that these people haven't tried actual ramen yet.
Marcus looks like Carl from jimmy neutron
Olu and Marcus shoe be embarrassed with their dry ramen💀 stan my girl cheyenne for having the best looking tamen
"not enough shrimp" y'all are broke college students..
There's Ramen(soup) and then there's Ramen noodles. I like my noodles without water
Some picky broke kids
Me over here eating ramen
WHY IS IT DRIER THAN MY GREAT AUNTS THANKSGIVING TURKEY!?
the only right way is to eat it how it was intended, as a soup.
Editor, why did you desaturate the video to high hell
olu needa shut the hell up with her dry nasty ass ramen
Ramen literally has soup lol-
your not supposed to eat ramen dry tf ramen is practically a soup   ALSO TO WHOEVER GAVE THEM SPOONS:  FUCK YOU HOPE YOU DIE SLOW MF AND I HOPE ALL YOUR KIDS DO GROW    TO MUCH?
The fact Olu said Marcus’ ramen was too salty then 2 seconds later she said the ramen was not seasoned. Come on now
“nigerian style ramen” afro americans want to be real african so bad lol
Did she say it’s salty ITS RAMEN
Okay. They need to just buy some regular noodles. Like what is happening.
The way Olu was so confident in her Ramen. I thought she was gonna win then looked at her dry ones.  And the way they judged the water-y noodles it's ligit how their supposed to be made. Ramen is kinda that food I could eat forever and with those Ramen cooking skills, it makes me feel better about the fact that I can't really cook.
Nothing beats my mom's Haitian Mud Cookies.
Honestly all you need in your ramen is hot sauce and Limon with salt and pepper 💅🏻
ramen is best when its wet!
I don't think they realie ramen is meant to to have soup
How can 2 people be so incompetent there is suppose to be broth
“It looks kinda dead” like you cheetah girl!
“I’d prefer my ramen a little dry” yeah we get it ms.BREADCRACKERS
I hate that cheetah girl she so dumb and rude and stupid and she’s so mean and if anyone says I’m mean for saying this she deserved it “olu”
"It's salty!" 3 seconds later "It's not seasoned!"
Bro ramen is supposed to be “watery” ITS A SOUPPPP
“The ramen has water in it” STUPID HAE YALL NOT SEEN RAMEN ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A SOUP WITH NOODLES STUPID
These people CANNOT be allowed in the kitchen
y’all all can’t cook next
this girl be rating the first guys ramen 2 and then het total score is 2 and the thing is she was hyping it up so much😂😂
the cheetah girl was talking about how she’d change each of their recipes 😂
Lmao Ramen is supposed to have broth/"water'".
Oluwamayoma Sindeiru!
So stupid. There are no true dry ramen. They all have broth
Bro the cheetah girl gives me rich selfish girl vibes- she thought the ramen wasn’t good because of the COLOR
Um.. we’re talking about ramen here not flavored noodles ofc there *SHOULD* be broth and the broth needs to be flavored with the noodles, that’s what makes ramen ramen and it’s what makes it so good
Ramen is all about the broth! What are y'all doing?!
Cheetah girl really said : " It's called raw-men for a reason."
The girl in the cheetah shirt pissed me off how you gone say I'm not trying to be mean but I don't like it it's salty and the turn around and say the only thing with flavor is the chicken 😩😂😂😂 I am flabbergasted an then told him to season his noodles lmao how sway either it's salty or bland you can't have both her whole life is a NO for me
Am I the only person who put boiled eggs, cooked spam and cooked asparagus in my ramen as a broke college student
I really wanted to see Olu's reaction to her ramen being the lowest scored😆 and why were Marcus & Olu talking about Cheyennes ramen being wet, its  SOUP its supposed to be
I don't like the water because it's to hot for me, sometimes I leave the water in but normally I just leave some water in, I dump not a lot out, it's just to hot for me
They already too rich for me. They making they noodles on a stove when all I had was a bowl, a microwave, and twenty dollars.
The 2nd one was the worst dish ever featured on this channel
“they added chicken to it, so that’s… a different spin.” THE SHADE 😭😭💀
The Ramen Matters!
Damn throw me in there coach im actually being s p i c y ramen and where is the EGG
Bro she said i like my ramen a LITTLE DRY like her ramen bro had chunks
isn’t called ramen noodle SOUP
Where is the broth?? None at all??? Wtf is this mess???
A nigga that doesn’t know what noodles are true disgrace
“It’s saltyyy are you going to kill me?” *Ah yes it’s supposed to be sweet*
when I make ramen I add garlic powder parsley and a little water not too much. Maybe cayenne pepper if I want some spice
some people don’t actually boil the water on a pot and use a kettle and it’s hard to make it taste good with just a kettle and a packet #brokeashell
this is racist because there are no white people
God bless, truly hoping y’all have an amazing and safe week. Jesus loves you. He died on the cross for our sins and rose three days later
“ItS SaLtY aRe YaLl TrYnA KiLl Me?!”  Her ten seconds later: “pUt SoMe SeAsOnInG oN ThIs!!”
Why does Marcus remind me of Sid the Science Kid 😂
Love how they say "broke college students" why you put chicken in that ramen then? If you was broke ass needa save that chicken for another meal son!
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH . Period.
Hi
"its salty" "this has no flavor actually" girl make up your mind
At least it's edible 😭
Why y’all give them spoons!! 😂
SHE PUT THESE LIKE NIGERIAN SPICES AND THEN MARCUS JUST LIKE "yeah i put some chicken in here" XDDDDDDDDD
none of them know what they doin wit da ramen💯💯💯
nah bro they ain’t doing this right 😭this is the ramen I made when I didn’t have a lot of money: Put enough water in a pot to make a pool for the noodles  Wait till it boils Boil the noodles for 5 mins and add the seasoning  Drain the noodles but leave a little bit of water left. On low heat stir fry the noodles with hot sauce until sauce is mixed in ( preferably buldak sauce)  Transfer to a bowl and while it’s still hot, add cheese and mix it in. If you want it to be creamier, add an egg yolk and mix it in. Add green onions and serve  Additional ingredient/serving options: Spam, Seaweed, rice, Kimchi, Ricecakes, Chicken ( I’ll do these ingredients once in a while if i’m feeling fancy ) It’s so good and filling, and it only costs a few dollars to make
Being broke i heard shrimp and i left. ☠️🤚🥲
Not the girl that likes her noodles not even made 😭
dude why are they complaining abt the water in the ramen 😭 and that’s the only way you can eat it
As a Nigerian we don’t claim Miss Cheetah print. She used our amazing spices to make BRICKS 😂😂😂
Negl this is some doo doo content
This is I'm broke cook it however to survive ramen. The ramens a bit watery...ummmm has she eaten any ramen before? smfh. Watch out don't let her try a real japanese ramen, she'll say oh that's super watery.
Ha ha remen And it's actually called ramen
why do they act like little bitches and not just eat the food.
I wouldn’t even put cheetah print girl ramen in my mouth😭
“Broke college student ramen” — adds shrimp…  Me (🤦‍♂️) “uhhhh! That’s not a broke person thing to add! Can of tuna that’s been tweaked with spices, that’s a cheap ingredient.”  Anyway, if I want interesting ramen I hydrate it up then completely drain it then stir-fry with available veg and soy sauce & Bragg’s amino acid liquid. Gives an excellent umami. Maaaaaybe that’s not ramen anymore and is takoyaki but whatever, I like it.
I wouldn’t eat any of that ramen I make a chicken pack then put a lil bit of black pepper and then onion powder adobo and the packet
the girl mayowawa idk she was so confident😭😭😭😭
are we just gonna ignore the fact that they’re eating it with a spoon?
Not ramen literally being a soup-
This is painful to watch
How you fck up ramen ?!  😂😂😂
Olu tryna give y’all acid reflux
Never knew there was black people that can’t cook… they don’t even know ramen beeds broth💀I can tell Olu can’t cook
There all black 💀💀💀💀
Throw me in coach, I’m ready to win this one. Cause ain’t no way these are serious. Lemme show em how it’s done.
Yow. THAT'S RAMEN??????????? THOSE ARE RAMEN FOR THEM???????? A FVCKING RAMEN??? yow i tell i never had a dry af ramen my intire life unless its stir fried noodles. But bruh I've been broked after my 1st and. 2nd year of college and i always had an edible ramen. 😭😭😭 Theirs look disgusting. Sorry but i can cook you anything better. I-  Help me omg 😭😭😔  Bruh YOU ARE BROKE WHY ASK FOR MORE SHIRMPS! 🤦🏻‍♀️😆
These guys are being way too extra, pretentious and snobbish over *instant noodles.*
is it just me or are they eating ramen with spoons
These kind of videos try way to hard to be all inclusive…
Why are they eating ramen with spoons?
the cheetah girl was flexin too mich
I guess they don’t actually know what ramen is
W only a spoon?..
Me personally I eat my ramen with soup in it so should I not be eating it like that???? After reading all the comments I’m gonna stick to my way
They using SPOONS
This was the most annoying one I’ve seen yet.
At this point..I don’t think any of them made ramen it just looks like sad instant noodles
Ok so y’all clearly like your ramen dry. But at the same time none of you used peanut butter? Rookies all of you
Afro annoying as hell
“Nigerian ramen” HARD PASS
Lmao they all look nasty 🤮 mines is the best
Some of these people on this show make me feel aggressive.
Olu and Marcus so broke they don't know Ramen is served in broth?
The fact she said the chicken is a accessory is so wrong. That's how ramen is made. With a bunch of broth, some kind of meat, and a cut boiled egg. So him having chicken wasn't wrong. The no broth in their ramen is a no tho
Lmao, the one who talks the most shit can't compete
I live with my family and weed roaming on a daily basis we like it for dinner but soupy like chicken noodle soup
Some of them might as well eat it just as is don't even cook it
who the fuck eats ramen dry? its a damn soup bitch
Cheetah girl said way too much water. Get the crushed up saltines asap I detected a bit of moisture we gotta get rid of that😂
This is possibly the cringiest thing I've ever watched on YT
The girl with the Afro was dtm talking bout other people food and her’s has clumpes my 7 year old sister can do better than that 😭
They are confused about water... who eats ramen without soup/broth?
Cheetah girl wasn’t you the one wit the hard ramen over there flexing wit that nasty ramen it’s not even ramen it’s a brick  She was talking about they trying kill her you trying to kill the other people
The fact is why the girl with the afro noodles look like that even I can cook better noodles then that and I 13yr.
SPOON??? A SPOON? 🚫🥄 🚫
The cheetah print girl has a lot of confidence that turned out to be annoying
Theyre making me mad
At first I thought it was big hair ...Then I realised it's just hair covering her big head 🤫🤣
The Nero major got a shit talking problem and it bit her in the butt🤣
Its them thinking there ramen is the right way when there no right way with dry noodles
Who wants dry ass ramen?? I leave broth add Sriracha, cilantro and lime 🤌
ramen normally has water like culturally its a soup like thing
Where’s ur broth , I’m thirteen and I make 20x better ramen than this… shit
This was so funny
This hurts me, it takes like 2 minutes to read directions on the packet, they’re there for making it properly. Also those ramens need more broth
cheetah print girl is ANNOYING and CRINGE
Who eats their noodles dry? They just picky are they just can’t cook how can you go wrong with noodles
so nobody leaves the juice in their noodles ?!??
Ok drain 3/4 of water then add SHIT tons of soy sauce
Since when is wet ramen weird
what the hell they mean, "its watery???" its a SOUP
did black people invent ramen?
How is shrimp considered cheap
WHY ARE THEY COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BEING WATERY 😭😭
Bro the ramen water is called broth and the broth gives it the flavor why do you think it tastes bland?
NAH NAH BRO THE RAMEN NEED BROTH. ITS NOT WATER ITS FLAVORFUL GOODNESS
All it seriously takes to prepare GOOD ramen…grab a Maruchan Ramen pack. Get a pot, fill that bitch with water and maybe some hot sauce for metabolism and flavor and spice. Rinse your noodles off and boil that bitch until it’s a good yellow color and make sure to put the flavor packet in WHILE the noodles are boiling, not after. It’ll sink in better if you do it while it’s boiling.
Wasted all that time getting a mass communications major stfu
The fact that the ponytail girl is eating it WITH A SPOON kills me 😭😭😭 (Cheyenne) Edit: They actually all are lol
man yall should,, watch people who been to prison ctfu but not like, actually go on you tube lol
You didn't tell us the ingredients that the second girl use
I would love to have people try my version. I cook it in the microwave and drain it until there's about an inch of water left at the bottom. Then I use the whole packet of chicken flavoring but others could use half if they don't like the saltiness. I then add soy sauce, a little lime juice, and a LOT of green chili hot sauce. Sriracha is also really good! Sometimes if I'm really hungry I'll make two packs, one chicken and one beef, and mix them together.
I notice that the rudest or overly confident ones in these contests are always the one that lose.  P.S. Ramen is an asian dish. It always has to have broth included
I seriously hate the girl I’m the cheetah print, she was SO full of herself to only get such a poor rating on her ramen and she was very judgy from the start. She needs a improvement on her judgement .   Chey was very kind and hilarious, and her ramen looked bussin.
Is it from is supposed to have broth?
Not everyone likes ramen in broth yall! Sheesh.
Cheetah girl single af, she ain't never been wrong in a relationship lmao.
The cheetah print girl literally doesn’t know the quality of ramen, like...  you had the most confidence but was the most disgusting. “I prefer mine to be a *bit* hard.” 1: ramen isn’t suppose to be “hard” and yours was concrete.  “Why is it watery”  ITS.A.SOUP 🤨
2:05  It’s salty...like, are you tryna kill me?! *aaæu* 😩
did the cheetah print girl just say “and we have rãmæn” 😭 0:44
Olu: i like my ramen a bit dry  also olu: this ramen is a bit dry ew..
Wtf is ata gungun??¿?
Watching this while eating ramen
And I thought I was bad at cooking 😭 "it's a little watery" wiped me outt. I hope these people go to a ramen restaurant one day to experience the real deal 😭
People who have never had real ramen before: "eww it's watery"
No broth you all lose ramen has broth get out of here man.
I feel like my ramen is pretty good.i make the noodles soft but not mushy,no water,the seasoning,onion powder,a little bit of  pepper,a hint of creole seasoning,chalula hot sauce and cooked chopped ham
Ramen: soup NOODLES: without soup
Mine would put them to shameee
Idk cheyenne gave marcus a 6 because of the chicken and didn't really like the noodles
Bro literally ramen is a soup, it can have water or not its like the don't even realize that 😭
I love how the rudest person got the worst rating :)
RAMEN IS LITERALLY MEANT TO BE WITH A BROTH- MOST OF THESE NOODLES AREMT EVEN RAMEN ;-;
So evb eat dry ramen
Shoulda put me on here 😂
how does only one of them have broth?
As an Asian, why does the ramen look sooo dry😭😭
Rating ramen is a logistical problem it’s only good to eat straight away can’t let it sit
Ok I see people hating on the fact that 2/3 of the participants of this video apparently don't know ramen is supposed to have broth. But, am I the only person that is super bugged that they are eating ramen with a spoon? Especially the 2 dry ramen people!! Why are you using a spoon?
That afro chick rude asf🤣
Olu about the guy's ramen: "It's dry."  Olu about Cheyenne's ramen: "I prefer my ramen dry." 🤔
Why would you have them eat noodles without a fork?
Why are they all black gross i hate what this country is becoming
I NEED TO KNOW OLU'S REACTION TO GETTING A 2
i feel like an amazing chef rn
“By waking up and deciding to make it” when I tell you I screamed 😂
Redish color 💀
I've never seen worse cheap ramens in my life, I'm a non broke college student but I make ramen cheaper than this and it's actual ramen as good as it's gonna get for a doctored up instant ramen
The funny thing is that I’ve made traditional ramen many times and it’s very cheap, there’s no need for all this random bs, if you want something different make it spicy, in fact make it spicy no matter what, and don’t forget your msg because msg is flavor, oh and don’t forget to put your seaweed in close to consumption time otherwise they will get soggy and flop over
RASIST
Did they TELL her to be super b*TChy or something???
Ian een watch y’all need me up there for dis
Nine of this was ok fr🤣🤣 why was one chunky, why was the other soupy, and the other dude was just idek🤣
“I dont like all the water” BRO
do....Do people normally not like broth with their ramen????  Am i eating it wrong???
"Why is it so watery" *THATS HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO BE- DUMMY*
I feel like just following the instructions on the ramen package will yield better results.
Lol they all black
All three looked absolutely disgusting! First off cook the noodles properly, add some green onion, a hard boiled egg you can do in a microwave, etc. it’s not rocket science!
Thanks for the whitewashing in the video.
WHY DIDNT THEY GET TO MEET
"I like my ramen dry" oh girly...we know
See when you ain’t Asian, everything don’t come through. The African chick talk a big game and hers look strange as hell. Also most noodles have liquid in it, so you guys already did wrong to begin with. You can do it dry if you do it right and know what you’re doing. Dry for stir fry. Also broke noodle dish can’t afford chicken and shrimp and all that seasonings. How is it you broke. The liquid is what keeps you warm and that’s where the flavors are at. They must of add the flavors during the cooking process and than drain out the liquid with all of that goodness in it. After that just added little little of flavor to it only because they’re scared. Sorry but Asians will do it right to certain point with the flavor. Asians with do it with a kick at least. Also will add that amazing egg with many other things, Broke or not broke. Most Asians are money savers.
That’s not ramen at all. Broke or not where is the soup? Where is the egg? Where is the little green onion?
Would've loved to see the reaction of the girl named owuddouwuwdo or something
“I PREFER MY RAMEN MORE DRY” must be a Nigerian thing.
Who the fuck wears their chain on the outside of their clothes ???
My mom is Spanish you mean Mexican
I always make my ramen as soup😂
HOW DO U FUCK UP RAMEN⁉️🗣️😹
Bruh what is this video nun of them know shit🤣🤣🤣 this shit had me weak
Cheetah print girl saying she like her ramen dry just like her skin💀
Who does Afro head cheetah girl think she is🥴
Am I the only one thinking about the fact they were eating ramen with a spoon 🥸
dawg idk what it is with non asians and ramen but WHAT IS THAT. for ramen to be ramen it has to have broth like cmon now
I know some people do eat the ramen dry and that some people do like the crunchy ramen , BUT ramen is literally meant to be a soup, not a pasta 😂 so yes it should have soup, first 2 people undercooked it just by the look, the 3rd over cooked it (or it sat to long idk) but overall just from looks the low ratings made sense …but get your ramen game up it’s making me sad 🥹🙏
these mfs are so full of themselves yet can't even make proper ramen
Ngl, u could've renamed this video something else.
Who eats Raman without the broth 😂
I am already tell ol girl in the cheeta prints is going to be gross
Next video idea who makes the best penitentiary ramen, go grab a couple brothers who been to the joint not the county but the penitentiary(we all know somebody) and see who makes the best jail house burrito
the only one that almost looks like REAL RAMEN is the last one
As someone whose had nigerian “ramen noodles” (indomi) there is NOWAY she knows what shes doing, Nigerians make THE best noodles! 😅
3:04 I’m dead💀
I love how the girl with the Afro was trying to act like the best yet she got the lowest voting and her one wasn’t even proper ramen you can’t say “ I prefer my ramen with no water” when if there’s no soup then it’s just noodles 😭
As an asian…Bruh ramen literally has two kinds. Broth and without broth.
"this shhh dry as hell" kmsl
“a *little* bit more dry”  hers looks almost uncooked 😭
Wait.. people don't like "juice" in their noodles?
Nah the first mistake is using a spoon instead of a fork😭
Am I missing something? I thought ramen was supposed to be soupy and watery 😂😂
THE LEAPORD PRINT GIRL SAID SHE DOESNT LIKE THE FIRST RAMEN BC IT'S DRY AND THE LAST ON SHE SAID IT WAS TOO WATERY AND SHE SAID SHE LIKES RAMEN DRY BRUH
This video is bogus
look how they gentrified ramen so bad this doesnt even deserve the title of ramen anymore
I feel like none of them know how to make instant ramen...
If my ramen doesn’t have broth I don’t want it
“I would like mine a bit more dry” Nah sis you like yours like a whole desert
idk about you guys but I just follow the I instructions on the packet.....
cheetah print girl: “i like my ramen a bit more dry” her ramen: *hard, clumpy, and dry asf*
All they care about is the presentation of the Ramen
nah bro that guy talks a lot for his dish  like look at ur own ramen before saying both of them ramens suck
I luv how she was SO confident
put me on there imma win 🤣
Where’s the water😭🧍🏾‍♀️ y’all pour all the water outt?? Why are y’all eating dry ramen😪
I dont feel my race being represented. You're racists.
Bruh, who eats ramen with a spoon? 😭😭😭
“It looks like it got flooded” that’s bc it’s supposed to have water in it😭
Why’s it all so dryyyyy???
Man I was a broke ass college student too and I got good at making ramen, cheap. Instant ones (Usually a few cents per packet) -throw out that nasty flavor packet- chicken or veggie broth which is around $1-3 in the two States I've lived. I'd buy a few green onions which are usually around .33cents for like 4-5 of them. If I had a few dollars to spare, a bit of ginger and if I had eggs-I'd hard boil one.  Usually spend around $5-$7 per half a week. SO around $14 at best the entire week.  Sometimes less because I'd hunt down those deals. But obviously, prices will depend on where you live and not everything is as cheap all the time. Still... I may have lost a lot of weight then but at least I survived.  Edit: Ironically, I was in culinary school lol Also forgot to say... what in the dry ass ramen is that? Whyyyy were they so dry? Thats not ramen anymore.
olu is a disgrace to Nigeria the fact she said Nigerian style.
Americans are the only people I see who use forks to eat rice and spoons to eat noodles.
No way ppl eat like this, all that ramen looked dead man. But I guess ifs normal 💀
Where is the M-S-G?!
I’m glad her goofy ass got a two
LMAO IM EMBARRASSED FOR HER
bruh u supposed to have ramen w the broth tf these ppl on abt lmao
Its always the hater that loses worst lmao
LMFAO @the African sista ramen😂😆she had SO much talk 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️💁🏾‍♀️😒omg this was a good one
RAMEN HAD BROTH THATS WHAT RAMEN IS NOT DRY SHIT man to the ones who said "I dont like water" STFU bi it broth. u need broth otherwise u need help. im broke af and I could do 10 times better than that. What I saw here was so sad it was I have no cooking knowledge broke
I’ve never felt more capable and competent in my life than watching these kids fail at boiling some noodles
Olu was so confident she would win and then she gets the lowest rating😂😂😂
I... Was eating cup ramen. Where are these people getting chicken and shrimp from? And then the dude was like "MOAR SHRIMP". Bro...
The second i heard the intro I was like omiawu shindaero
Olu was fucking annoying
traditional ramen is drowned in BROTH :I whachhu mean you eat dry ramen?????
I would crush the ramen, put the seasoning shake the pack of ramen and eat it like chips 🥲
Bruh the cheetah shirt Girl is so freaking annoying now one liked it 😭
None of the ramen looked good 😂
Anyone looking to step up their ramen game add some frozen peas, crack an egg in there while it is still boiling and add some instant dumplinngs with some green onions and seseame seeds
cheyenne is gorgeous 😍😍😍 im suprised no one is talking about that cuz shes so fine 🤣🤣
IM DYING LAUGHING THE LEAPERD SHIRT GIRL.HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HERS LMAO!!😅😅😅😂😂😂😭😭😭
Ok but the guy do be having a good science of humor lol
BRO WHO EAT RAMEN WITH A SPOON LOL!!!😭😭😭😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
Ok but is it just me or the two girls look not poor at all? Idk I just thought that
“it has no color” who’s gonna tell her
plsss where’s the flavour on this channel 💀💀💀💀
Nija girl, should have gone with indomie, no need for crayfish. Its too sophisticated for their palates😂
idk why they thought ramen was supposed to be dry, ramen is a soup so it’s supposed to have broth… and it’s not that hard to make tasty ramen, just follow the instructions of the package and that’s it  also their attitude was pretty annoying (except cheyenne’s)
BRO RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER!!! OTHER NOODLES DONT HAVE WATER
The fact they got mad ramen had water made me so mad, it’s a fucking struggle meal shrimp expensive why they mad she put a little bit. These like those people that complain black pepper is spicy
girl in the cheeta print mad annoying
Okay redo this because how do they not know ramen comes with broth? Is that a west coast thing? Lol also a SPOON? Dafuq
The 3rd ramen is the correct ramen.
ngl I can definitely cook better than them I had higher expectations
Why?????i wanna see them be in 3rd place (reactions)
Why don’t people just make it normal 😂
Bro that title is just, harsh
The AUDACITY of Olu and Marcus. "Its a little watery" MISS GORL!!!! Her ramen is rock solid. In my opinion they might need to re-do this but with people who actually have an interesting palette and with more people as well.
You guys care way too much about what the "correct version" is, let others enjoy food however they want. The beauty of food is that its customizable not eating it exactly as the label says. Lots of fantastic foods would not be made if we stuck to eating plane roasted meat!
girls saying ew is so boring and typical.. like 99% of yall  are terrible cooks urself...
😒😒😒 all of these looked soooo bad
No need to specify that they’re broke💀
Aren’t you supposed to have a broth for your ramen?? I’m surprised they don’t do that. The broth also makes for some extra sustenance, you’d think as broke and hungry college kids they’d try and get as much out of it as they could 😑
non of y'all can cook omf i fucking hate people this is pathetic
i don't like the women in the cheetahs attitude
Can't be that broke if they can afford to put other stuff in other than the ramen and the seasoning package that comes with it.
How do you mess up ramen noodles to the point of scoring a ZERO😂😂
Lol i honestly wouldn’t want to eat any of these lolllllll
The ramen has its own seasoning like bro...
dudes the definition of slender
*I want my ramen more dry* then you just made yakisoba
Why did the two with the most dry ramen have the MOST to say. Like, I would rather have too much water than what your cooking😂😂😂
I can’t tell of Olu was actually joking about the rating and her noodles or if it’s for real
I love my ramen with broth in it. The others without broth look dry af
Only clicked on the video to say that the thumbnail and your face in the beginning of the video made me gag.
Um so that's all she has to pay? That is not being broke.
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WERE EATING WITH SPOONS
Nah bc the last one is the only one I would eat
I feel like some of them playing 🥸
She really complained that ramen was salty
Who introduced them to ramen ? Cuz they dont know wtf ramen is What u mean to much water??? Ramen has broth ! And someone tell me what that slumpy shiz was… And wtf they using spoon ?… Im gonna make myself some ramen to heal from this
I just found out that you can eat cup noodles with cold/room temperature water. if you add room temperature water to cup noodles, and leave it for 10 mins to 15 mins. It'll rehydrate and taste the same as the ones with hot water. I had no electricity or money and I only had like a cup of instant noodles and a pack of chips. I did not sleep hungry. It was just cold. But a full meal.
Why they acting so weird about the “water” (broth) it’s what ramen is supposed to come with its the soup, the flavor-
Olu and Marcus not knowing what broth is infuriates me beyond belief. Ramen is SUPPOSED to be "watery". PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
They eat there noodles with a spoon 💀
Olu smoking that spice
Um u said ur mom is Spanish be Spanish u mean mexican
I have the worst internet rn
Moral of the story, stick to cooking soul food and leave Asian cuisine to the Asians. Afros always be braggin how they food seasoned but they juss dump powder for days on it and call it quits
All of them, are bad at making ramen.
Affro girl just got a different taste I guess ^^' but all the noodles look like sh*t to be honest. Add some greens...idk. But if they truly broke I understand that in America vegetables can be expensive
RAMEN NEEDS BROTH. WITHOUT IT ITS STIR FRY
oh they should try my ramen 👁👁
She Went Wrong by waking up today and making this got me rolling
She did prefer her ramen more dry so maybe next time she should not cook the rame at all 🤣
Cheyenne was a great sport and I think she actually rated the others fairly. Edit: She was also such a vibe.
Why is it dry?! It need broth! Also, all overcooked and they’re using a spoon? Illegal lol.
I laughed my ass off with the second ramen when he said it was dry as hell 🤣
Really missed the opportunity to bring an Asian kid into the mix
This was gold 😂
It's good to see my cooking confidence skyrocket after watching this
I just follow the package instructions and maybe add a boiled egg, it takes serious skill to fuck up instant ramen.
Eating ramen with a spoon, who did this.
im actually shedding tears rn
“WE HAVE REMEN TO SAVE THE DAY”
ok but like, why does everyone’s ramen look like shi-
“It’s salty 😢” yeah. He seasoned it.
Dudes over here  eating their ramen dry... IT SHOULD HAVE BROTH, c'mon
😂😂😂
The chick at 0:38 has that hairstyle that is in every commercial and advertisement
You can always tell in these video who is insecure about there dish because they always give everyone else a poor score…like Marcus dish looked way better than that clumpy mess…i would of threw that away in her face.
Ramen needs to be very saucy or "brothy". It ain't chow mein it shouldn't be dry ass noodles. I love mine chicken flavor with a squirt of lemon and a dash of tapatio.
Who else wanted to see the mean ones reaction to her losing
Never wanna see Olu again dawg, straight hater
The fact that the girl was the rudest in dead ass got the lowest rating... LIKEEE GURLL NOT TOO MUCH OVER HERE DOING THE MOST..
Who tf eats ramen with no broth
As an Asian this video hurt me.
There's almost always that one person in every group... 😂🤣🙄
Omg the cheetah girl said “different vibe” 5 times in this video
It's kinda funny how they don't like the soup in the ramen while the soup is pretty important in the ramen💀
"its a bit watery" as it should be? asians also eat it that way , the third one was the most normal one
I am confused as to why they're weird about it having broth saying it's watery... It's RAMEN not pasta it's literally supposed to be watery. 2 of them had no broth and one did... do yall just pour out the broth???
No cap no disrespect but Olu was kind of a douchbag
how do you say “cheyenne” name?
2:17 when she said they needed to season it but just said it was salty 💀
"Are you trying to kill me?" Girl you already killing yourself eating instant ramen daily to begin with
I don't understand how anybody can eat dry ramen. There was this one time I was in daycare and the lady working there gave us ramen but there was no liquid in it. I couldn't eat it because it was so dry. The flavor was there but it was dry I don't like dry food.
The black one is so rude  Bro-
Bro the cheetah print KNEW the last one was good. You could see how annoyed she was to say it was good
'I would prefer my ramen more dry, this has water'  My chinese ancestors are writhing in their graves My friend's japanese ancestors are writhing in their graves And I am writhing in my chair
olu your ramen looks like the ramen that is used to repair things on those 5min craft videos LMAO
“its salty like are you trying kill me 🥺🥺🥺” girl gtfo
is this cultural appropriation? lol how tf u gonna judge ramen when you dont kno anything other than 20 cent microwave ramen. these all look like shit, and the spoons just piss me off more lmfao
I like my Ramen with a little liquid in it. Don’t nobody want no dry ass noodles.😑
I know she lying her ass off TFYM GREY ?
What is RAAAAAMEN
Why are we so judgmental on each other aren't this supposed to be a safe space for people this is so cringe why would you judge people so harshly that what wrong with people we need to embrace each other instead of always acting up .
“i prefer my ramen a bit more dry” her ramen: 🏜🌵
As a Nigerian I am personally offended with that horrible cheetah girls ramen she embarrassed the nigerians
Sorry. This isn’t broke college ramen. You don’t have those spices in the dorm.   As a former broke college kid (90-94), I learned how to fill that Ramen up from my homeboy who was in prison. They called it Chi Chi. Ramen noodles, cheez it’s, chopped  up slim jim, bbq chips. Cook the noodles first, add those other ingredients and let sit for 3 minutes.
The fact that they’re eating noodles… with a spoon….
humble urself bro
wtf did i just watched.. ya'll cant call those ramen like huh??????
The cheetah girl won't shut up about her damn Nigerian spices
Broth homies not water
All were nasty
cooked her lil RUDE ASS 😂😂😂
I like My ramen microwaved for 4 minutes and then you drain the broth out when done then I add the seasoning
I was so broke I couldn't even afford to go to college. I know many others that were too. They're not broke, this is pure privilege right here.
I would never let any of them cook my ramen my little brother cook better ramen then that 💀
I'm not a big broth in my ramen person myself but they're supposed to be in broth.  Sure as hell tho my noodles are still never dry as these were, it's as if they've never had actual ramen before.
You suppose to leave the water in she did good I like the 3rd one
its funny how the girl with the curly hair thinks her ramen was better than the guys even though no one liked hers
You should make it so they react to their scores and talk to the other people who rated their food.
Cheetah print girl is so rude and her food looks do badd
Why does the color matter? 🤔 And why are people complaining about ramen being “soggy” or “wet”????? Ramen is a literal soup lol
1:23 "bring it on"      ...and then they brought it on
The hell were you all eating except the last girl’s. Like for mine you can bet I’m adding more water than I need to because my Valentina and limón are gonna make a nice soup for the noddles that *slurp*
wheres the soup
I'm sorry but oluwamayowa's ramen looks so dry it's all in chunks. Like I've seen dry ramen and that's fine but that's too dry
"the chicken is just an accessory" no it's a main ingredient! you need some other foods to pair with the ramen.
Am I the only one who actually just uses broth in my ramen
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon??  Can someone give them chopsticks or at least a fork??  Sheesh
You know you're broke when you can't afford to cook ramen...
the 3rd girls noodles looked good
after looking at these three peeps ramens...... Nah... They are no ramen chefs. You don't need to do much to make ramen tasty. F'in shrimp.... HA. Yea.. Let some broke ass college student bust out F'in Shrimp
its supposed to be noodles with soup.... why are their ramen dry af?????????????
Bro💀💀💀 some people don’t know that ramens supposed to have broth
Mannnn, Olu shit talked everyone’s and got a 2 😂. “More color” bro its Ramen relax
Cheetah chick been pissin me off whole video her Ego is through the roof when she can't even cook.
After all the long talk 🤣🤣🤣
RAMEN ORIGINALLY HAS BROTH BRO WHAT R U GUYS ON ABT
"My mama told me if I got nothing nice to say don't say anything at all" Shit that's good advice, Imma take it 👌✨💖
The girl in the black shirt's giggles of uncomfortable is so hard to watch meanwhile Olu is bragging away girl hush
You didn't like the " water" it called broth,lol the broth make the ramen FIY the added in s are just adding flavor  I mean i add Scallions, a egg, Goya adobo and Goya Sazon to mine, and both of those are cheap i feel like they should do this ep. Again but mybe with Americans from diffent culture  but the broth should be the if homegirl can add shrimp to her ramen take those shrimp shells and boil them down add an onion and salt and pepper and that right there will make a delicious shrimp stock as the base for her ramen dish it's simple cheap tricks like this using the ingredients you have on hand like the shelles from your shrimp to make added flavor, hell one time I eat out and got a seafood boil I used the leftover seafood ate that and use the shells to make a delicious shrimp stock that I then added to all of my ramen BTW you can freeze shrimp stock and it'll last in the freezer for up to a year
So Ramen is Soup
ITS ALWAYS THE 1S WHO SAY THELL WIN LOSE 😕
People that eat ramen with no water need therapy. Fr.
ramen is supposed to have broth in it.
“U tryna till me” as she attempts to murder the two other contestants with her ramen
The one who talked the most crap was the one with the nastiest food
I love how they each downplay their ramen to win the money themselves so they can afford better food lmao
From the spoon to how dry most of that ramen was this was such a painful watch
"I preffer my ramen dry"  Bye-
Lmao ramen is so easy to make a gourmet meal just solely depends on ingredients used !
have these people never had ramen
You know I get that Cheyenne's ramen was the best so her confidence was well put but either they were told to act overly confident or they're just people who are like that, all three of them seemed so sure and sassy about something like ramen, I mean I get that its a comfort food and all but there's no need to be so cocky about it.
Affirmative action
Wth theres no broth in there
who eats dry Ramen? RAMEN IS SUPPOSE TO BE WITH BROTH!!!! I vouch for the 3rd ramen
As soon as she said she added oyster sauce I knew she was gonna win. And iono why they want dry ass ramen lol. The shit is a soup lol
what happened to shin ramen
Tsunami comment feeling racist and wtf is with these people eating ramen without broth anyway.
kinda glad they rated hers so bad for all the shit she was talking LMAOO
Yeah I would have gone with the 3rd ramen, I like broth in my ramen
If y'all been locked up before y'all would be more creative with ur ramen
I don't think these guys know what ramen is...
mfs don’t realize ramen is a soup dish
My ramen coming hawaiian style
it’s always people that talk the most sht that really are just reflecting themselves 🤣
Ramen card revoked
She says it's so salty then says the only thing that has flavor is the chicken?????
always that one cocky mf
that girl with the cheetah print is so dumb
Cheetah print had a dish that was laughed at. We’ll deserved
Actual broke college students don’t judge ramen like this. “I don’t like the water” bruh like be for real
bro that olu chick judgy ash actin like she above everyone.. like girl calm your tits..
☠️☠️this girl was Talking smack about other peoples Ramen and then hers was worse
Even as a Nigerian,  I dont like my noodles dry🤧 come on!
Oh I wish Ik about this cause my Roman was crazy people was buying it that’s how I made my money that and doing hair and nails.
cheetah girl can’t cook. PERIODT.
Ramen is literally a soup 💀
"There's not enough shrimp"  Me: but.. you're suppose to be a broke college student and shrimp are expensive....so of course there wouldn't be a lot 😅😅😅"
Oh my lord cheetah print girl is obnoxious
Oluwamayowa was tweaking that bitch was CAPS LOCK
Also karma hit the cheetah girl she was so petty and thought she gonna win and she got the lowest score and who else does not like blocky noodles or rice or ramen
Marcus recipe so simple but so good and the other ones suck and they add to much and they think they is the best but his is the best
Is no one gonna talk abt how there eating ramen with a spoon????/
I hate they way they judged each other's good. They all were insulting.
Girl with the shrimp my noodles will kill hers I put  shrimp in mine sometimes I use chicken n hamburger also cream cheese gives it that creamy taste
None of them can make it 😂
Diaspora yoruba nigerians are at it again. What do you mean you push crayfish and ata gungun in your indomie? Nobody here does that, NOBODYYYY, even the yorubas who put pepper in their ice cream can’t try it. Indomie can’t even be dry like that😭
Hate the people in all these vids that are like the cheetah print girl like why ain’t like you do this shi for a living when in reality you don’t like it always been theirs that be the worst to like wtf
All of them lose, plain beef top ramen wins
Something we could all agree on is that crayfish saves the day
there aint no way they eating ramen with a spoon💀
Ramen is not supposed to be dry it's supposed to have some soup in there 🍜
these people wack for having no broth for their ramen.
WHOOO eats ramen without the broth ? DRY SOUP ikyfl, I eat my ramen then drink the broth idgaf
this girl said its so salty and said there is no flavor
it’s always the cockiest who lose 😂
"The Ramen is a bit watery"  Goddamn I wanna Asian slap the hell outta you sis.
Chicken one best one
To all the comments about “how could you eat ramen dry” or others most people don’t eat it the soup way as most people don’t have time to make a good broth so it’s just seasoning in water and it’s not very nice
damn why all these look so bad
I just don’t understand why people eat ramen with no broth. It’s supposed to have broth. My wife eats it with no broth, I’m white and grew up in a white family in the south so of course my family ate it dry but wtf, it’s supposed to have broth.
When Olu said she likes her noodles a bit dry, I was like no shit lady, you had chunks. I cannot eat dry noodles. It shouldn't float in water, but just keep it alive, damn.
First off who tf eats ramen dry 😒 second why the fuk are you putting chicken and seasoning in it lmao it literally comes with seasoning packets OMG I wanna smack the ish outta all three of them.
They had to say broke kids 😭😭
My recipe: Instant noodles Boiling water in a pot  Chilli Beensprouts Chicken flavour/stock cubes Spring onions And one fried egg😊😊😊
The thing that’s getting to me is this they are eating ramen with a spoon like if u don’t know how to use chopsticks use a fork
not the afri girl trashing every one and then gettingn total rating of 2
Cheetah girl : this is just dry and I can’t 😖 Also cheetah girl : I prefer my ramen dry 👁️👄👁️
their ramen is way too different from what I normally eat, or it may also be that I am from other planet and their dry ramen is normal for them, the third person at least have water in it
Kinda f’ed up that you put “BROKE college kids try each others ramen”
How do you mess up ramen this bad?
My ramen is not cooked at all with the chicken seasoning and a crap ton of lime that’s it !
"A little more dry" bruh your ramen was rocks 😂😂😂
Can we get like a follow up video from Olu? What was the vision for this dish, and did something go wrong girl?
Cheetah print girl boasting about Nigerian noodles but doesn’t even use indomie.
Secret tip to the broke college kids out there. There’s a sauce called ‘tian mian jiang’ which translates to ‘sweet noodle sauce’ that is used in Asian cooking and a lot of dry ramens to give food a dark color and saltiness like soy sauce that also adds a tiny bit of sweetness and umami. It’s the key ingredient to jiajiang noodle or the ‘Korean fire’ Samyang noodle we all know and love. For the people out there trying to make their own noodles from scratch this is something worth playing around with.
why their ramen look like that
yall guys  really put broke
“It has water in it” it’s supposed to dumbass
I’d kill anyone in this comp
Literally ramen with the soup is my favorite part
Put me on here I bet I win
"I don't like all the water"? dude that's called broth. you been dumping a straight packet with no water? you been dumping the packet in but then draining broth? all you got to do is follow the directions. let you know what style they want you to make. if you want a ramen with no broth AKA "water" , then buy one. there are plenty of tonkatsu ramens that tell you to leave broth in, there are plenty of tonkatsu ramens that tell you there will be little to no to no broth because it's all absorbed into the noodle. ...   I understand preparing Marichan how you like it, but if you're dumping the seasoning packet after you drain the water youre just setting yourself up for heart issues later in life.   I think I just gave way too much of s*** about how some other dude made his ramen
None of them know how to make ramen and they really be rating each others 🤦🏾‍♀️
How do you fuck up ramen
he just did that because she said that his Ramen was bad
i love ramen, cheap and yummy
Racict
I’m actually in grade school. These people SUCK AT COOKING
any other people realized that they didn’t use the soup..
cheetah print needs to be humbled RIGHT TF now.
I’ve never had dried ramen before
Literally 4 cheap ass things u can add that u probably already have in ur house to make ramen a bit more boujee: 1- soy sauce to make the broth a bit more salty 2- a fried egg on top of the noodles 3- some chilli flakes 4- some spring onion Also if u have any sort of broth or stock make the ramen in a pot and add any extra veggies u have to make it more hearty. Literally bitch on a budget lifesaver that won’t make u depressed bc it actually tastes good 😂
"Don't like the water." I also used to eat dry ramen, then I learned what ramen was: a soup.
3:14 he got his comeback 🤣
cheetah girl annoyed tf out of me
ramen is soup can y’all realize this one day 😭
Uncle Roger is not pleased. #Embarrassment
can't stand the second gurl....... she think she chief ramsy
RAMIN RAMIN
“mY mOm is SpaNish” gurlie ok lol
Dry Ramen?😭
How does cheetah lady go from it's way to salty to it has no seasoning??????
Idk I feel like I’d win this lol
Yall americans really making us East/south east asians laugh and gag with your nasty “ramen” recipes lmfao
Only time you would hire blacks in a non-sports/entertainment company is if they won the position from affirmitive action, someone felt sorry for them, or the company wants to look like an equal opportunity organization
Honestly I say soy sauce siracha and chicken and get rid of half your breath at th end that’s how I make mine or I would ad a splash of lemon juice
It’s salty but then only the chicken has flavor🧐
title is outta pocket
the one with the shrimps definitely looked really good imo
All of these people are being way too extra. First of all, the ramen is the broth, not the noodles so I would classify most of these as just noodles, definitely not ramen. Second of all, draining the broth out is like taking all the fat out of a steak, it just doesn't make any type of sense. And third of all, if you're so broke, you shouldn't be adding shrimp to your bland ass noodles and you should be drinking the broth because it still has nutritious value. If you want to make your cup noodles taste better, add a hard/soft boiled egg to it (I like hard boiled because I like the texture better). And if that won't satisfy you, find random stuff in your fridge that could work. You could add bacon, collard greens, maybe some seaweed or maybe even some mushrooms (don't knock it until you try it). But always remember, if you're so broke you rely on cup noodles, don't throw away the broth.
Shout out to Bridgeport
So it’s salty but needs more seasoning
Ramen meant to have watery stuff
the cheetah print girl was so annoying 😭
Sis or bro we need to talk😂
Don't call stir fried noodles ramen
ramen should have soup in it
they do not look like they are broke  especially the tiger print girl
Bruh, the first 2, just wow. Ramen has broth in it ppl, its not dry clumps of noodles lol.
🤦‍♂️ y’all picked some wack college students. There’s supposed to be broth in ramen! You can do a fry noodle type thing but oooff these kids are wack
"You gotta put more shrimp" You're supposedly broke. Shrimp is rare when you're broke. 🤣
You know u lose when u ramen sticks together
nah why’d you give them spoon for 😭
this is embarrassing
The girl who kept saying my ramen is better like chill girl you lost
"I dont like all the water" you mean the broth... on of the main components of soup... 😂😂😂
ngl none of these look the slightest bit appetizing
NAH BRO THEY REALLY ATE REALLY ATE IT WITH A SPOON 💀
As someone who eats ramen with the broth, I would definitely rather try the last ramen than the other 2 dry ass ramen.
💀
If you can hold it with ur friends it gotta go 😭
The fact is the broke college students are Black and we tend to have our ramen on the drier side. I realized that when I am around more Asian cultures, the ramen is made correctly with the broth and it's usually seasoned way better than just the salty ramen powder pack. I think that the girl who won, should've won, hers looked the most like an actual meal and not a snack. The other two looked like something I would whip up in a hurry to satisfy my munchies.
Cheyanne's was the most sane
Afro b!tch- Way too salty Also Afro B!tch- THERE IS NO SEASONING. SEASON THE RAMEN! 😠
Nah she embarrassed Africans around the world 😂 and why are they complaining about water in soup im lost
None of them could make Ramen. I wouldn't want to eat their Ramen. 😂😂
Mexicans: Hold my salsa Valentina and lime
americans be like
I don’t understand dry ramen. You got to eat it with the brothhhhhh. So you can eat the ramen and toppings first and then drink the broth! 😂
I like my ramen “a little crunchy”
Cheetah Boujee.. These mfs eating with spoons.. And adding shrimp is a plus.. steak would be better tho..
The dude had me crackle when he said that whoever made the chunky Ramen went wrong just waking up and going to the kitchen to cook-💀🤚🏻
I make my ramen soup style with mirin, Thai red curry paste, and a half tablespoon of sesame oil in the broth. Then I add fresh mung beans, shiitake mushrooms, green onion, a bit of fresh ginger, and crushed red pepper. Shrimp is good if you have it, but it definitely doesn’t need it. A soft boiled egg is nice too. Some of those ingredients are a little pricey (mirin, sesame oil, curry paste), but once you have them, it lasts a while and it becomes part of a staple cheap meal. Garnish with Thai basil if you have it. 👌🏽
When i was in school i would add, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and honey, add chopped up broccoli in it add a few boiled eggs, It ended up more like stirfry but it always got me thru the day
Lmaoo why they all black in a broke college kid episode 😭😭☠️
Olu you goofy as hell come on now sista represent! Cook yo noodles better!! Love u tho peak confidence
Important note: whoever brags the hardest on your cooking skills likely is the worst at it
Why don’t they understand; RAMEN issa SOUP!!!😂
The other people are trifling good thing for the girl who won, who ACTUALLY know what ramen is 💀✊🏽
Drop 3-4 broccoli florets into a pot of water, bring it to a boil. Drop ramen in, cook until it starts to soak up the water and come apart, then crack an egg and drop it in the boiling ramen. Let it cook for an additional 15-20 seconds, then strain until you have your preferred water level, and add flavor packet. 👌 You can thank me later.
Just follow the directions on the packetttt 💀😭
“Nigerian styled ramen” girl Bffr now 💀
All of these were hella boring. I’m just a broke person and still make better ramen. Also why was cheeta print girl so rude? She seems very self centred. The last girl though hers seemed really good. And the guys was just… Americanized ramen lol. Again though the first girl should’ve just pissed off.
i hated marcus and cheeta print girl. like it’s ramen it’s supposed to be wet, and they were so cocky and just rude..
Non of them made good ramen bro
Cheetah print sucks
it’s always the ones that hype their food up the most that ends up with the lowest score 😂
Cheetah print girl going on about how the other girls had no color, but all of them looked the same (other than the broth)
Sissss, this isn’t fufu. It’s ramen mama. 😂
Why is there chunks does she know she actually got a crunch of noodles this is for the cheetah girl by the way like Dude even when I’m sleepy I still be making better Ramen in this girl sure had a lot of confidence but sure did not have any skills with that food
i'm so glad her ramen was dog shit
Oluwamayowa allergic to salt or sum?
They don’t seem like broke college kids if they’re adding shrimps & chicken in their Ramon
"It's ok, I like the shrimp" - gives it a 3
Why are they all black🤨
You selected the wrong group of students. These people are confused idiots.
Cheyenne's was probably the best. The other two both looked really dry. I swear some people make their ramen with no water idgi
2 of them don’t know anything about ramen at all
All of them ramen don’t look good😭😭😭
I think I'll just stick to the packet seasoning
Ummm the ramen is technically supposed to be soupy yk like a broth😅😅
Any one else eating raw ramen while watching?
You are not supposed to drain the ramen at all why
why call this ramen? its noodles ;-; Ramen has a savery broth and toppings
that cheetah print girl got humbled so hard oml
As a fellow Nigerian I’d like to say our indomie noodles aren’t all dry.
So black people cant cook ramen …
“I’m pretty sure this one is gonna win” Hers:literally just chunks of the ramen
WTH is this? All this shit was wrong. Baaaaby where’s the broth? I make my “noodles” like a soup I don’t know wth they was doing. And we grew up saying noodles not Ramen 😑
Her name is really oungalaboungala
Ramen is a soup... don't they know that? 🤣🤣
Oul/the cheetah print girl naw 💀 she was to confident is true her ramen looks like she crushed it and then cooked it for like 20 seconds
Bro said it taste like hurricane ian
even tho i dont go to college simply cause i do a online one, i know to use water for ramen or noodles like bruh you need some kind of liquid to soften the noodles cmon its comon sense!!   heck id sometimes in a pinch if i had leftover soup broth when the the contents of that soup were pretty much gone, id use that for flavor its great!! also if you go to a local dollar store and buy those tiny canned sausages and chop some of that in it and water down the broth in it works amazing too!!
As an Asian my mom would whoop my ass if I cooked ramen like the cheetah girl. Nu uh
If you aren’t making ramen with Louisiana Hot Sauce and Pace Picante you’re doing it wrong.
Dawg wants the fuck is wrong with these people dry ahh ramen that shit shit is supposed to be a soup.
bro im so mad with these people bro who says im scared because the ramens watery bro thats litterally the main point and bro who eat ramen dry and who want it to be try my dasy u actuall hobos
seafood is expensive bro. cant get more shrimp when you are a BROKE college student
cheyenne made real ramen and she won. who would have thought
no veggies in this ramen.........
okay but who tf eats ramen with a spoon😭
Man people really can’t cook you can make so much better shit with instant ramen😂
They all failed successfully
i can make better ramen
Ramen should have water in it, and it’s self made add you own amount of shrimp bro!!!
I was wondering why the people in the bottom right werent moving or blinking until I realized that it was a photo
The sins committed on the ramen….. did cheetah print even boil it???
no way you guys can eat ramen without broth. be fr. No way in my life i could eat those ramen tbh.. they look so dry
Lmao the cheetah girl called the first noodle dry but hers doesn’t even look cooked well with dry chunks
This is why nobody takes college students seriously anymore
Bro ramen is supposed to have liquid!!!
this video just played after a buzzfeed video and I regret watching it. like. brooooooooooooooooooooooooo ramennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn shouldddddddddddddddddddddddddddd be wetttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!! imagine making watery jollof rice. CULTURAL APPROPRIATION would get U killed. but hey, this is RAMEN. nobody take it seriously.
WTF  a spoon, im out
But how broke are you if you’re adding chicken or shrimp
Mine goes in a bowl and is a soup. I eat the noodles and slurp the spicy juice, and I want peppers in mine. Am I weird  Edit: Wait nah these people just are built different. The comment section is literally going crazy at this lol
i can confirm that us college students run on ramen
Tbh they all don’t seem that bad because When your broke in college you can’t afford like sauces like teriyaki and butter for your ramen
Notice how all the broke college students black¿ and just because you eat ramen you broke?
Ramen without water????!?! The broth makes the Ramen actually good... It should be wet
Is it too salty or is it not seasoned -.-
I could do better and im 13. HOW IS IT HARD ???
cheetah girl got the audacity to shit on other ramen after making that shi bruh 😭
2 indomie and 2 eggs all i need for a feast
I’m just glad that that last girl kept some water like all y’all’s ramen is so dry 😭💀
her mom is spanish?
Broke college kids complaining . Stop that. Go to a BBQ
I’m Nigerian and they don’t know how to cook any type of pasta.
Cheetah bougie cheap🤣🤣
oowoowhaiwhaiomagosas is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very broke college student
Bro that’s mean calling them poor they are plenty good and humble❤
They are not broke college students they are just some kids who cant cook instant ramen the right way
The way to eat ramen is soupy not dry ew hahahaha
She said it was salty like it wasn’t ramen
Ramen is supposed to have soup.......like.......what's up 😑
Remen ;-;
Yeah, they dont have a clew
Ramen is a soup. It is supposed to have water.
just because ur broke doesnt mean you have to eat bad cooking is so cheap turn cooking into a hobby and your money will stretch as far as the eyes can see
why is packaged ramen what people think ramen actually is
I only make ramen when I’m starving and have nothing in my fridge.  Hear me out: 1 packet of Lao Thai ramen,  Cook the ramen and then strain it (yes it’s going to be dry)  Add all the packets in but only 2/3 of the soup packet so it’s less salty Mix it up and diced up some spam, if I don’t have spam I use Vienna sausage. Mix all of it together and then I’d lightly put on some Japanese mayo and Chin su hot sauce. Lastly, add some scallion  Mix that up and ur good.  Call me weird all u want but I freaking love it.
That girl with the cheetah print was being a complete bitch she knew damn well that his was bomb but she just wanted to win. :/ Twisted.
Why are people acting like Ramen isn't supposed to have 'water.' Ramen is supposed to have broth 🙄
"I like my ramen more dry" girl we know this, yours was clumpy AF.
This is why I joined the army. So I could have good food instead and get paid
“My mom is Spanish”🤣
The girl in cheetah print is giving the same vibe as the old lady from the pie video “Where’s the flavaa?”
Can you use chopstick bc ramen use chopstick in japan
Olu needed to be humbled 😩…
“It has water..” bro it’s a SOUP ramen has BROTH. Ramen without broth is just hella salty noodles-
We don’t make Ramen 😂 we make noodle 🍜 YOU HAVE TO DRAIN YOUR NOODLES that’s just how we do it. Last girl noodles was completely disgusting she over cooked them and they drowning
I make the best noodles 🍜, tip get some Beef Or shrimp noodles, grab some hot links cut them up, cook some bacon 🥓 break it down in put it in your noodles, drain your noodle no juice. Best experience you’ll have
The title disrespectful
Her: Season the ramen!! Me: What happend to saying it was salty?? Her: *Shakes head in dry noodle*
they’re all so judgemental while all being hmmmm at cooking themselves
Don’t disrespect soup ramen while I’m eating shin ramyun 😭
5:28 “My first instinct is just to smell it just to make sure im not eating anything bad“ I think you need to smell your food again to realise if its really good lady
Bro its soup wth put some water
this is making my appetite go away... please someone send an asian in there
Why is nobody talking about how they ate the ramen with spoons??
did she really say “Remen”
The challenge was make ramen not chow mein.
"the ramen is a bit watery" bro 💀
Even my ramen looks better then there's
"Im gonna win this" 💀
I wish yall tried my ramen i learned how to make in prison..ramen noodles, cheetos, slim jims, pickles, tuna, jalapeno cheese spread
If you are able to afford fresh parsley & green onions that will jazz up your noodles too ❗... I like Cheyenne's style & some fresh herbs would have gave that extra bang.
I was hoping to see cheetah's reaction
Ramen is a soup Ramen is a soup
If yo ramen dry call it stir fry
This is not ramen
Why is everyone on this show black
Ramen is supposed to have broth. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is so insulting I can’t even-
God you can tell Olu-whatever the hell her name is, is one of those school girls who thinks she's superior to the rest but in reality has a below average grade in every test
To be real, everybody likes their Ramen differently. Some like soup and some like it as mush, or even raw.
I'm watching this despite never having ate ramen before
I’m confused by all the people who have never seen someone eat dry ramen?! I grew up in the Bay Area of Cali and we have a ton of Asians and Latinos here and EVERYONE ate it dry in middle school, or at least saw someone who did! It’s a classic school kid meal, and I’m sure went on to college too. It’s not the best imo, but many swear by it and it’s a common struggle meal!
Im more concerned as to why they are using spoons to eat what is essentially spaghetti 😅
Cheyenne is the only one that made something we might call ramen. The other two made something, just not ramen. Ramen is a noodle SOUP the noodles alone doesn't make it ramen.
So cringe eating it with a spoon lol
Why is no one talking about how they are supposed to be broke but they be putting fucking prawns in their ramen ☠️☠️
Cheetah print girl is hella pretty though.
she just said it was salty then said it had no flavor and seasoning? gurl
Ah yes, eating ramen with no water, LIKE WHAT
I wish they would show us the reactions when they found out they didn't win ...especially cheetah print girl who was mean and LOST 😭😂
the only problem is THAT THEY EAT RAMEN WITH A SPOON
My goofy ramen recipe: Take any ramen packet (I prefer shin ramyun) and cook the noodle in just enough water to cook it. Season it with the packet, and when there’s basically no water left add some ✨cheese✨and stir. Add too a plate, top with a fried egg, and boom! Delicious   3.58-5.00 depends on what cheese you use
This entire video made my head hurt.
Cheetah girl was super  extra
The internet exists and this is how people are cooking their ramen while bashing others. T_T The last girl was the only one I had respect for, but everyone has different tastes. Hopefully this humbled cheetah print girl.
i bet these people only tried ramen once for the “broke college student experience”
Bro most people don’t now most ramens are supposed to have water
I wanted to see the reaction of the losers once they heard their score.
Do people really eat ramen without broth..?lol
I can’t get past the fact that we’re eating ramen with a spoon?
Do they not know ramen come with broth….
why are they all lowkey assholes
as an asian person with a very bad diet and eats instant ramen on the daily… what the hell.
Shut down the studios 😂
"THE RAMEN MATTERS"🥲
My ramen would have won forsure. i make chile chicken lime ramen with bone broth with veggies.
you called these ramen? 🤧
They all look trash honestly 💯
WHY ARE THEY ALL SO DAMN DRY!!!!!
cheyanne is giving me sister act 2 Lauryn hill vibes. she's gorgeous
If anyone needed to hear this *cough cough* RAMEN IS SOUP
Cocoa cocoa butter cheese
All Asians would absolutely be triggered by the "water" comment.  I know I was.  Ladies & gentlemen, it's called RA-MEN (拉面), IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATERY PART CALLED SOUP/BROTH (汤).  🤦🏻‍♂️🙈🤦🏻‍♂️🙈🤦🏻‍♂️🙈🤦🏻‍♂️🙈🤦🏻‍♂️🙈🤦🏻‍♂️🙈🤦🏻‍♂️🙈
This is NOT broke student ramen
I don’t understand why people cook ramen without the water?? The packet is supposed to make the “broth” There’s instant stir fried noodles and instant ramen noodles. Also why are the noodles in chunks?
cheetah girl really out here making sure she talks about herself in ever clip possible😀
The actor deserves to be poor
I don't understand the "broke college student" thing...I worked and went to school full time. Sure, it sucked ass but I could eat and pay my bills. A few years later I had a kid and went back to school for something different and STILL worked. It can be done, I promise.
Yalllll 3:13 killledd meee 💀💀💀💀
honestly , I’m no chef but all I do is make the noodles, drain the water out, I add a decent about of butter, and then the seasoning so it’s nice and like.. creamy as you can say.
5:51 “this is fucking amazing, but I have to say it’s terrible to boost my chances of winning…”
people that eat their ramen dry 😖
They'd have a melt down with mine. Because I actually make ramen the way it's supposed to be made. Granted you taki hot Cheeto mountain dew drinkers barely have taste buds n would prefer McDonald's and trash packaged ramen anyways. Also Ramen is literally supposed to have a broth they're dumb asf 😭
Acting like they fucking rate ramen for a living
Indomie is what’s pulling me through college rn it has awesome flavor it’s only 99 cents for a pack and it always tastes amazing
Cheyenne the only one that made actual ramen lmao like wym like what dude talking about “hurricane came through” ramen is soup. As for cheetah print girl it’s too salty but it’s not seasoned???
the hell is this bruh this sh aint even ramen 😭😭
Dry ramen do exist. Not all ramen have soup in it. But obviously it has to be cooked first and not like that girl who has that crunchy lookin ass ramen.
The cheda print girl was rude ngl
The cheetah girl is mad disrespectful when she cant cook herself
L cooks
how they talking abt each others ramen but they eating noodles with a spoon.
I thought ramen was supposed to be soupy ... cuz it has broth ... the ones that are dry are either mi or maggi goreng or dry ramen
For broke students they are still too... choosy?? Also the faces they made before even tasting 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Girl in the cheetah dress, your ramen  looked like it died and you served it in a bowl for those poor souls to eat. The nerve of you criticizing other people's ramen, shame.
Who eats ramen with only a spoon.  Don’t hit me with “traditionally…”
The title sounds like some prn video.
"i dont like all the water" babes thats called broth..
what bothers me the most is the fact that they are eating the ramen with a freaking spoon
A good ramen must have some broth in it periodt else it dries out I usually add some ominous and sweet pepper and a little squeeze of lime and crush red pepper to mine and hotdog or chicken
Eating noodles with a spoon? Wtf
Ramen is not supposed to be dry. What’s wrong with these people
She's complaining but this is a BROKE MEAL.
All of them are just getting *Emotional damage*
Bruv ramen is supposed to be watery like its freakin RAMEN
Noodles with no sauce I'm confused.
Why’s everyone’s ramen dry as f?????? The last girl has the same type of my instant fried noodle i would cook. Everyone making their ramen so dry i could hear my mom almost whack my ass for cooking something instant so wrong😂😂😂
LMAOOO THE NIGERIAN GIRL TALKIN TOO MUCH SMACK 😂😂😂😂😭😭😂
The cheetah girl liked the shrimp and she thinks it tastes not good but REALLY good yet she gave her a two? Also, she contradicted her self many times! first she said the guy’s ramen was too salty, ten seconds later it’s not seasoned? What’s more hilarious how she said that his ramen is dry when hers is literally still crunchy uncooked because as she said after that, she likes her ramen a little more dry. I felt she did all of that so she can win. And like always the nicest person wins and the snobby mean one can’t cook, not even instant ramen.
Can chicken is good in ramen noodle but it's like $2 a can that being said chicken and crushed up jalapeno Cheetos two packs to a half bag of Cheetos and a can. A little hot sauce if I'm feeling crazy.lol
Title was a little brutal lol
Am I the only one making ramen soup
A real college student wouldn't care about the other things, small taste takes the trophy
Bro these 3 people don’t know shit about ramen! Their delusional af and don’t understand that Ramen has to have water in it! Like bruh
How u gon say it’s salty then turn around and say nun had taste but the chicken
I’m a college student who stayed at my college yesterday for 15 hours before going home. From someone with 21 credits and incredibly overwhelmed😭 I put up with that store bought Ramen and drench it in Tapatio I wish I had motivation for shrimp or chicken  These people are so negative dawg💀 it’s literally just ramen and they look at it and say it’s gross… the dude on the last ramen hasn’t even TRIED it yet and he’s going off for like 2 minutes about some tsunami shit
There's all looked like shit tbh needed to put a white girl a Hispanic & an Asian on this b**** all black was a bad mix up
The video title is kinda harsh 💀
the girl in the cheetah print shirt might as well just crush up the ramen and call it a day
“watery” ITS RAMEN😭😭
It’s watery? You mean broth?
Lol cheetah girl made bird food
Why is their ramen all dry and shit? Do Americans throw out the broth? That's like eating a burger but throwing away the buns or patty.
Why they all black 😐
All this look drrrrrrrrryyy
"there's not enough shrimp"  BITCH Y'ALL ARE BROKE. THIS IS BROKE RAMEN Of course there's not going to be exploding with shrimp
Y'all want noodles, not ramen. Ramen is soupy, ramen has broth.  I don't know why y'all are mad at brothy ramen
"Nigerian Ramen"  Bestie..... Girlie......   Sit the fuck down
5:37 "I prefer my ramen a little more dry" yeah we can tell 🤣🤣
There is water in it. Yeah, have you ever had real ramen? It is essentially a Noodle Soup. She likes the ramen more dry? Goes on and serves clumps of dried cat poop balls.
wait….. y’all don’t leave a bunch of water in the ramen to soak up in the ramen… yall just…. Drain,, all.. the.. water??
These people are talking too much without saying any sense. 😂😂😂
The cheetah print girl is dumb I don’t eat ramen dry first of all HERS BARELY HAS ANYTHING BUT SPICE AND YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE CLUMPS OF RAMEN LIKE…LEARN HOW TO FUCKING COOK
They went wrong by cooking Lmaoo
why is nobody talking about how theyre using a spoon 😩
Olu fr be complaing about their ramen and giving them 2 while hers wasnt even fully cooked 💀
cheetah girl:its too salty,r you tryna kill me? also her:THERES NO SEASONING
Cheetah girl fr just put eh ramen in the micowave w no water💀
That thumbnail is beautiful.
Moral of the story: don't be boastful be a little bit confident
I feel bad for olus future or present husband or boyfriend-
I like how they said they were broke
“Shout out to the shrimp that saved the day!@
“ i perfer my ramen a little dry”
The rules of ramen  1. The noodles has to be the person's preference example ask the person who cooks their noodles what's your preference of a the perfect noodle like do like your noodle soft,andante,mushy, 2. The noodles must have flavor in other words the noodles have to have a balance amount of flavor again it must comes with the person who cooks it
“I like my ramen dry “ girl we know WE KNOW
Man they're all narcissist. It's just ramen and they gassing then selves up so much. Idk man if it were me I'd just be like "if you like it cool, if you don't whateve."
Ramen are watery ?? Ramen is a soup!! What's wrong with these people ??? Shrimps and chicken are not college broke food to me, that's pretty expensive. I used to eat baloney ramen, not good, but cheap as hell...
best and easy hack i do is cooked bacon and butter thats it plus the bacon grease
Bro I can do better than this
cheetah girl please give yourself advice on how to cook better before giving other people
as an American raised in Africa for 4 years, I can clarify that africans LOVE spices (: (my parents are native to Africa, btw)
"And weh have Ræmen to save the day" why isn't anyone consirned about that....
oml no way that man and cheeta woman disrespected the ramen water, i literally cannot eat ramen without the broth bro 💀
Y‘all have no taste 😂😂
People don't like ramen juice?!?!
The wrong thing about instant ramen in America is that anything that’s about noodles are called “ramen” which is that term refers to a soup based noodle from Japan. However, many instant noodle brands from many different countries has their type of noodle that can be dry or wet.
If these people eat ramen without the water, they shouldn’t be rating ramen cheyanne is the only normal person
chayene pls stfu tf do u mean add color 😭
I have a friend who’s name is Olowasolape so idk if the names are from the same culture
YES, ramen is supposed to have the broth in it🤤
the girl w the afro is lowkey trippin. the mf said "this thing salty" then proceeds to say "season the ramen"
they takin the piss outa this show they gave them spoons to eat ramen tf and the highlights of afro girl getting cocky and then getting a mad wake up lmao thinkin she know something with those fancy spices 💀
imagine making ramen without the broth 💀
Olu was so disrespectful about the other contestants noodles she had so much to say about  everybody noodle then she wanna to shoutout to the shrimp that save the day I think the most respectful person was the girl in black  but olu was saying that she added this and that me thinking it gonna taste go but I guessed not guys this is episode one of people who celebrated to early  olu was too hyped like slow your role girl Everybody else noodles had look like something that I would eat And she wanna talk about all the things she put in it  OLU YOU CANT COOK
Y'all need to re-do this because none of them seem to grasp that ramen is supposed to be watery. It's in a literal broth.
Ramen is supposed to have broth with it….? What kinda ramen have these people been eating 💀💀
cheyenne is so nice and pretty
why are they all black thats racist
now i consider my ramen a 5 star meal coz i be just cooking them samyang carbonara buldak ramen with milk like majority of the people but it tastes and looks so good compared to...that
They all suck it was embarrassing
Why the hell are they eating with a spoon Lmao
Watery ? Yeah you've never eaten ramen gurl
Just boil 2 cups of water with the noodles, add the packet (maybe 1/2 because it’s a lot of sodium), whatever vegetables you have, meat, tobasco sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce (low sodium) cuz again, we cut back where we can. Keep the broth cuz it is more filling.
Ummm Miss Cheetah Girl 🥲 WTF ? How she going to say it's salty and saying the chicken has flavor and the only thing seasoned but it's Ramen and need to season it 🤣. How u bitter and contradicting yourself? U can tell who grew up in terrible toxic judgemental households by how they react to stuff as adults if they haven't healed self as adults
being asian and seeing them using Spoons for ramen is depressing and they aint even using the seasoning packet 😭😭
This isnt ramen, ramen comes with seasoned water or broth. I dont understand why ya'll labeled this ramen, it's legit just noodles and seasonings, NOT RAMEN. If you served that to a Japanese person they would probably fucking barf because ramen has BROTH OR WATER IN IT NOT JUST SEASONING AND NOODLES.
The cheetah girl I didn’t like her
to be honest  I'm sorry but, what the hell were those dishes 😭 Only cheyenne's ramen looked decent enough (also why they are complaining about the water it's literally what ramen is 💀)
“it’s too dry” “it’s too watery” “it’s too salty” “it’s too bland” “it’s too hard” “it’s too soft” MAKE UP UR MIND WOMAN!!!
The fact that the cheetah print girl said his was dry and hers look like she put one drop of water
And if these people are so broke.....how they putting shrimp and other stuff in it. If I was "broke".... I'd just be using the season packet and make due
😭😭 like bruh okay dry ramen is preferred by some but not that rock looking shit
That cheetah print girl needs to get humbled WHAT IS THAT..
"iTs A bIt WaTeRy" OFC IT IS DUM DUM THOSE 2 OTHERS YOU MADE AND MARCUS DUDE MADE LOOKED DRIED AS F😶CK YOU LIKE YOUR RAMEN DRIED YOUR NASTY BRUH
Remmen
How could no one like the broth :(
Ramen is supposed to have broth
First question upon clicking: Where is the broth
Cheetah girl be like, I'm not eating it if isn't pretty😂
*not tryna be mean*  you tryna kill me?😢
the one who had the most to say got the lowest rating
Cheetah girl needa chill wit her smart ass 😂😂
My ramen I like ginger Sriracha eggs spinach a little broth more kinda steamed it's my profile pic lol
Um the last one it the only one that looked good and ramen is a soup it's supposed to have broth these people made it to college quit go back to middle school home ec
I’m sorry but I know all these r trash Bc you need water in your ramen like- it’s prolly and the one girl who put water in it it looks soggy even he said it was slimy when you make ramen it has to stay in the water for a minute to keep that springiness and a little undercooked Bc it still cooks in the water while your adding your seasonings
BRUH OLU EMBARRASED THE SHIT OUT OF HERSELF😭
Cheetah girl done herself stupid 😭
its watery I prefer my ramen (a little dry).      yea a little to much dry
I make a custom siracha hot sauce with honey, add cheese, and use the black label fire rooster ramen. its some of the best shit ever.  Sauce is Panda Express Sweet and Spicy, Franks red hot sweet and tangy, siracha sauce, siracha paste, honey, black truffle hot sauce, and a tad bit of ghost pepper/carolina reaper siracha. and I mean LIGHT
https://youtu.be/Wng3rq5c06M
These people dont even know what ramen is, complaining about the water, SMH. Did that girl really put cheese inside her ramen? bruh. I feel so much better about my cooking after seeing this abomination. The last one looked the best to me. I wish we got to see the cheetah print girls reaction to losing
Why the hell this is called ramen recipes when none of those ramen has proper amount of broth 😭
Cheeta print is so embarrassing and cringe 😭😭
"I prefer my ramen dry"  ma'am, ramen isn't supposed to be dry, that's why no-one liked yours
Cheeta girl is getting on my nerves
What a title
"I would prefer my ramen a little dry" GIRL WE KNOW. dry ass crunchy ass ramen
Bruhh how do y'all not know how to do ramen 😭💀 and college style means cheap and affordable.  Get your noodles cooked in boiling water then drain them.  To serving bowl add some nut oil, chilli flakes, season packet.. add the noodles mix and add whatever protein you have like chicken or tinned spam.. fried egg on top or boiled. Bam golden.
I would've won with celery, ham and carrots. Little bit of lemon juice and hot sauce: you can even throw in an egg if u really hungry
All were garbage ramen lmao
The ramens not having broth is making me mad (I’m Asian 😭) also cheetah print girl is so full of herself😭😭
6:47 Okay now we are gonna take advice from the cheetah print girl? Lol
STOP I THOUGHT RAMEN HAD TO HAD SOUP IN ITTT
That bih cooked that ramen like it was forgotten steak on the grille
Umm cheetah girl??!? Cook your ramen??!!?!?
Do they realize that ramen is supposed to have soup with it? :')
only the last girl's ramen was ramen, the rest were noodles- Ramen come with broth and ofc its watery I dont get these people
“Its salty.” … someone call the police i need to go to jail cuz this girl… just.. RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE SALTY!!
This is so sad and so hillarious at the same time, rate each other ramen by college studnets =)))
Cheetah print girl ego a bit too big
Bro the that guy is soo annoying he shouldn’t be here no one likes him he has no friends and probably fatherless and if he doesn’t have friends I mean it makes sense cuz no one wants to be friends with a annoying person like wth
cheetah print girl is honestly givimg pick me vibes she though her ramen ate. TBH this how show is is getto af like tf
Ramen is supposed to be moist, not necessarily wet, even though it is literally a soup! if you drain all the water, it clumps together too much, you can make a ramen bowl by chopping up your fav veggies to top it with, but the idea of ramen is it is an inexpensive meal; we have it for emergency food, when we run out near the end of the month.
Ramen comes with broth.
they all suck xD. i can do better no cap
I want to know what their budget was. 🤔
bro they even cut cheetah print girl's name🤣
Dawg none of these people are qualified to rate ramen when they’re complaining about it having a BROTH. You know, one of the STAPLES of actual ramen
the cheetah print girl gon be say all everyones noodles are bad but never thinks her noodles are bad
What kind of broke college student throws away the Broth out of the Ramen? That's what keeps you full longer. Something is wrong with all three of you 🤣🤣🤣
Why tf are these people confused with the water in ramen 💀
This was HORRIBLE 😭
Any flavor works if you add queso fresco add some mayo and avocado and some crunch up tortilla chips ...don't let me start with prison recipes
I wanna smack the shit outta cheetah print girl if that was me I would eat it be great full to get food
"watery" XDDDD bro im dying its RAMEN
why they give them a spoon smh
When I make myself ramen noodles, I love adding in either a hot dog(chopped), or chicken, vegetables, any seasonings I have, and an egg in it. And as bad as this sounds to you guys, I always cook the ramen until it’s somewhat soft, and I NEVER, EVER, strain the broth. Because to me, that’s the best part after eating my ramen.
Why are all of them black and then the tittle says “broke college kids”? Are you being rastist?
Why did they give them a spoon with noodles
bruh why the cheetah print girl judging like she’s on masterchef. like chill it’s RAMEN 😭
him: "it's dry and crunchy" also him: "it's like mushy saltine crackers"
Eating with a spooooooon 🥲
First the girl with the cheetah pring said the ramen was DRY and then when cheyenne had BROTH in HER ramen she said it has WATER ITS SUPPOSED TO THATS THE POINT OF RAMEN. SHE EMBARRASSED HERSELF BC WHA THE HECKKK
Lmao it meant to have water 💧  And lol the Nigerian girl was BUGGIN lmao
Ramen is supposed to be a soup. Tf you mean it's too fucking wet???
The Cheetah print girl literally said she like her ramen dry🤨, B*tch who eats their ramen dry? And ramen broth should be in the noodles to give it flavor other wise you might as well just eat it without the seasoning
"its watery"... uhm these college students obiously don't know how to eat ramen. ramen is literally noodles with broth..
isnt most instant ramen.. like red.. or yk a color.. Not dry… or crunchy..?
okay but where is the soup..
I like to leave some water in mine so they aren’t too dry but I don’t like to have a mountain of water
Cheetah girl Was talking up her recepie tho 😂😂😂😂 and they were like "this tastes like ass"
That black girl with the afro had no right to judge the others 😂
Could you shut the phone 📴
The Nigerian lady didn’t surprise me they stay being rude and arrogant just to get embarrassed 😆
Ramen is literally meant to have broth lmao. You do you if you drain the broth but that's literally what ramen is ... a noodle soup
Why do they want dry ass ramen tho da Fck am I watching
i love how cheetah girl was like “its salty omg..” do u want it to be sweet??
2:20 she really said com on guys it's ramen but yet her ramen aint ramen it so Nigerian noodle
Bruh it’s instant ramen not gourmet noodles.
"bring it on" *gets last*
it amazes me that these people don’t realize that ramen is supposed to have broth💀💀💀💀
Yall hate soup? Broth is supposed to be watery
Had to find this video on my phone (watching on Xbox) because the amount of bullshit coming from 2. First the Narcissist girl made the worst one, said bullshit (the flavor is in the broth mostly, and non yall had it), dude over cooked his ramen all to hell. The last girl they try had the best ramen I bet. But add these because I found to be best: Fuxk adding protein, it’s ramen, it’ll be bad for you either way😂 Get the CUP of ramen Garlic salt Onion powder Seasoning salt Cayenne pepper  Hot Mexican chili powder Use chicken broth (or whatever flavor you like) as the water to cook it in Let it sit for 5 minutes and it’s great. You’re supposed to eat ramen directly out the broth for the flavor
everyone ********* on eachother
Why they eating it with a spoon
I prefer just following the pack's instructions and throwing in some toppings after it is cooked. Dry instant noodle is either too salty or too bland. Just me?
When he said MARUCHIEN.... ITS MARUCHAN WITH AAAAAHHHH AT THE END
I added sausages in my Ramen with some garlic powder and some garlic bread
they took Asian cuisine, and slaughtered it
Im not even trying to hate but after seeing this shit i gotta give my Filipino homies the credit they deserve casue the broke romen they make look way better then this and imagaine taste way better. shrimp ramen didn't look terrible though id eat that but the one girl had crackers as her noodles.
They make me really angry. Like- do they not know anything? Cheyenne was my favourite. And what was up with cheetah girl shitting on everybody else like her ramen wasn't literally the worst.
If there broke why are they in college? It. Cost 100k
bro why they hatin on the brothh also this omu girl legit talked the most and served the worst man
mf i eat ramen without any added stuff
they need to chill. why the attitude
Im sorry, but all of their noodles were wack... specially the dry ones
Cheyenne’s ramen looked really good in my opinion!
Damn, i’m reading the comments here, and so many people here hate dry ramen lol. I just drain the broth because i literally hate it💀
Where is the Indomie gang at?
RAMEN DHOUFL HAVE BROTH WHAT ID HIS 😭😭
so racist for not showing white people, this channel sucks!
Everyone’s ramen looks trash and dry 💀
girl with the puffed up hair is acting like a fake ah chief gordan like damn its js ramen lmao
None of them tried to make it more like actual ramen!?
This is... NOT RAMEN AND IT HAS NO BROTH!!!
''I would prefer my ramen a little dry'' Yes girl, we know 😒
5:25 I find it funny how the girl who had literal crusty clumps of noodles made fun of other peoples food. Seriously, if u get 2 score out of 20 and all of it was out of pity, then u can't really say anything. 5:35 Ramen is literally supposed to have broth. It makes no sense to have dry noodles. Just eat some crisps ._.
Yall should have picked people who know what ramen is 🤦🏾‍♀️ why are the questioning is being soupy
Them complaining about the water in literally what’s supposed to be soup 😭
Everyone: why does all the ramen bowls look the same?  Me: why tf are they eating ramen with a spoon💀
I'm so confused how these ppl never put water in their noodles💀 best part
I didn’t realize being broke meant being horrendously inefficient in the kitchen.
Ain't nobody talking about why they using a spoon to eat ramen 💀
where the asian people ramen?
Cheyenne was nice but I was not feeling it with the two others
Fish in ramen
the nigerian girl is a pickme
My guys they don’t know ramen is a soup and is so painful 😭👏🏼
“THE RAMEN MATTERS” -person who doesn’t seem to know what ramen even is
wheres the broth...😭
cheetah girl is def a pick me.
Why do some people act like you’re not supposed to drain the water not everybody likes water in there noodles
"Where did they go wrong" 💀
the girl with the afro gets on my nerves
"i prefer my ramen dry"    THEN ITS NOT GODDAMN RAMEMN
"im a texture person"... wtf is a texture person? youre not an "x" person, bc u value certain things... like, if your food is cooked to mush or not.
olu got DeStRoYeD
Why is the ramen so fucking dry and dirty, why isn't it fresh??
leopard print way too fuulllll of herself
RAMEN IS A SOUP SO YES IT SHOULD HAVE SOME WATER IN IT, BUT IF IT DOESNT THEN THATS FINE. EAT IT HOW U WANT TO. GOSH ppl pick fights over every damn thing. Arguing ab watery noodles in the comments omg
Who else eatin romen rn 😂😂
These are all terrible and not because it cheap in theory
If you can afford to put chicken in the ramen that isn't somebody else's leftover chicken that got left in the fridge unclaimed then you ain't a broke college kid
Bro what? Ramens supposed to have a broth.
id perfer mine dry just make dry pasta bro
do yall think they go into a ramen restaurant and say "can you drain the water out tho"
This hurts me tastebuds just from looking at it
Olu and Marcus are polar opposites LOL
I adore the girl with the crop top she is nice
The boy and the cheeta gurl suck
yall nigerian "ramen" is not ramen its not meant to have water in it
These three. I feel sorry for their ramen... It ain't ramen. Its a nightmare desguised as what I used to try. Let one of my old friends cook for them. Hell let me cook for them. No color. Dead. Gross. Give me 5 minutes (excluding shopping time) and $10 total and I can make something for them all that will make them question what ramen is. It wont be as great as what ramen should be. But it will be better than that shit.
That second girl is a 🤡
y they eating it wit a spoon
they did her wrong in the thumbnail lol
I knew her noodles was gon be weak
Did they let it get cold?
I am 100% sure I’m a lot less experienced than these people and made some amazing chicken ramen with broth, actual chicken breast
I just love how they all are roasting their ramens bruhhhh
Ngl why did those two ramen have no broth, and when one of them had some of it they were like "Why is this ramen watery?" ;-;
2/3 don’t even know what ramen supposed to look like🤧
they eating ramen with spoons lmao
why dont they just make normal ramen with seasoning packet
Who the hell eats ramen without broth as a meal? Like I know some people eat the dry uncooked noodles as chips as a treat but just dry cooked noodles? Not even the noodle seasoning? What's wrong with them? Where were they found?
I love Ramen without that much water,but that cheetah print girl,One word only *rock*
"Are u tryna kill meeee"  Yo jit its salt
it really makes me realize that i really am in a big bubble of what i know and thinking everyone would do the same THE BROTH IS A KEY PART PEOPLE, YOU CANT HAVE EM DRY THATS DISGUSTING
Three college students being black for me😭 if you don’t understand what I’m saying then don’t comment please.
I deadass just crush hot Cheeto puffs and pour it into chicken ramen LMFAO #brokecollegestudentlife
I'm confused by this series. Are they instructed to diss each other? And are they instructed to be over confident? Also, people recognize that ramen is traditionally meant to be a soup and noodle dish, right?
It can’t be even considered ramen at this point xD
cheetah girl refuses to let someone get a good rating
I would obliterate them in best ramen challenge even tho I ain’t old enough to cook I make delicious ramen
Dude saying she needed to add more shrimp its BROKE college kids trying each others ramen so... STFU
That dude saying that cheyenes ramen is watery lmao ramen is supposed to have water. Ramen without water are not ramen but noodles.just pathetic
“It’s too salty are you tryna kill me?” Shut up cheetah rat, your edible rocks are dry and boring
it lok dead her loked clupy
Love how the cheetah girl was so full of herself, but then gets a 2. Talk abt being humbled 😭
That cheetah print girl trash. Can't stand her energy.
Shout out to BRIDGEPORT UNIVERSITY IN BPT CT🗣🎉🎉🎉
This video just shows the level of ignorance amongst Americans. Ramen is a traditional Japanese dish served with BROTH! Like what do you mean it’s “watery” 🙄 it’s ramen of course it’s “watery”.
WATER IS IN AUTHENTIC RAMEN AND THE PACKAGING SAYS TO PUR WATER IN IT AT SOMEPOINT SO IM GLAD SHE IS THE THE WINNER CAUSE SHE GOT THE CLOSEST TO ACTUAL RAMAN
to be honest i couldn't eat any of theirs but, if they like i guess
Oluwamayowa: it tastes pretty good *Then gives a 3*
Don’t be like the cheetah print girl she really tried to be different 😂
‘I don’t like how there’s water in it’ DUDE THATS WHAT RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE!

Who tf eats ramen with a spoon
Did Anyone Else Just Get Hella Pissed That Some Of Them Were Eating The Ramen With A Freaking “Spoon“????    Is It Just Me Or....???
they did not like the water in it.........
don't like all the water in your ramen???!!!! it's called fucking BROTH!! and it's what ramen needs to incorporate flavors! omg this fucking generation... it's ok you guys will be out of water here in a couple years don't worry..... jeeeeesus.
ramen is not supposed to be dry ur supposed to leave some water in it omg
Bruh that cheetah girl felt she Gon win hell nah she ain't
Ramon is supposed to have broth with it like bruuuuuuh
“My first though it to smell it, to see if I’m not eating anything… bad.”  Quote Leopard girl 🤦‍♀️
Olu was all talk XD
Atleast Cheyenne was actually nice when she was rating the ramen unlike the other girl that had bad ramen
this has nothing to do with the ramen but WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON
Is nobody gonna talk about how they are eating it with spoons?
I don’t know why the girl in the cheetah print is trying to put everybody down so she could win. When her $h1t  is dry as  hell and clumpy like let me teach you how to cook🤦‍♂️
Bro how does one possibly fuck up in a ramen contest???? Like all you have to do is boil, drain, add taste maker, mix and eat What's so hard abt that ong
Imagine hard noodles in the microwave
The big hair girl literally said, “are you trying to kill me”. She said it so sadly, like she just being extra.
the dude looks like the ginger from mr peabody or something
Marcus did cheetah girl dirty with this is dry as hell lol
Cheyenne was the only one who gave them chances lol but cheetah girl was so rude lol
Olu is the definition of don't judge a book by its cover. At first, I thought she was gonna be so nice and sweet and cool because of how her style is so cute and fresh but then her true self came in and it made me hate her for being so judgy and rude to the others. Her's was the worst because it was like a goddamn ball. Cheyenne made it correctly and it looks bomb af. the other guy was similar to Olu, very rude and full of themselves. Their food was the worst compared to Cheyenne. Cheyenne is my favorite she's such a sweet confident woman.
These kids graduated high school and got accepted into universities but don’t know that ramen is wet.
Cheyenne's looks AMAZING Marcus's ramen is alright Olu.... bestie forgot to cook hers.
They all lost. Who taught these kids how to cook 🤦🏻‍♀️
olu is tripping like this ain’t a 5 star restaurant tf damn fucking bitch like what are u doin
My 'ramen' (instant noodle) recipe :    Boil water Add noodles  Add half of the seasoning Mix Wait for it to finish Mix again Drain half of the water Add the rest of the seasoning Mix Plate it Get utensils and enjoy!  Hope you guys like my noodles recipe 🍜 Enjoy it!
"My mom is spanish" You mean your mom is Mexican She is not that smart for a college student a 7th grade kid know better
No cause what in the ramen is this girl 💀 we talking the Japanese traditional ramen or the instant ramen? Cause girl what is this 😀
They don’t know how to make ramen and the “water” is broth😭✋🏽
am I the only one that thought that Olu girl is crazy she said Marcus ramen was too salty then said only the chicken had seasoning
To be honest dry ramen isn’t bad, it’s like chips but with WAY better flavor, but I’d honestly eat the last girls dish any day because she actually put broth in it
My ramen starts with boiling a pot of water adding tajin shakes and some of the spicy beef and ramen packet and then some tonys chacheres original then straining it but keeping some of the juices to mix then add all the seasonings together after its strained and put in a bowl (dont add to much tajin or it will be very salty 2-3 shakes in the broth and 1 shake over the ramen while in the bowl). And thats my broke college student ramen recipe yall go ahead and try it if u want
I only now noticed they’re eating noodles with a spoon…
I wouldn’t think broke college kids would have such high standards for ramen 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Alll that ramen looks nasty 😭 I would def win if I gave them mine
Idea: Asians trying each other's ramens
Bruh I feel like if any of them brought some ramen other than the cheapest ones possible, it would've been a whole different video.
the cheetahs girl is just straight up anoying
So they called the last ramen watery but like there was like only a teaspoon of water tf how do they eat cup of noodle soup or ramen
“There’s not enough shrimp. “    Ok then put another piece of shrimp on the fork
Y r they called broke
do they not know what broth is 🥲
“Why is there water?!” It’s soup, my guy!
Olu you are a embarrassment to this society- no this whole world. That confidence and you didn’t think twice about “my ramen is chunky” your embarrass me
“It’s too salty!!” “Are you trying to kill me!?” It’s literally just cup ramen. It’s not meant to be a $300 gold ramen with braised pork and flavorful broth.
I'm so sorry, BUT THE CHEETAH PRINT GIRL IS REALLY TESTING MY PATIENCE HERE
All these contestants are way to cocky, they aint even think that there should be broth- another thing is why yall eating it with a spoon.
hold on. how have other people been eating ramen? is it just us koreans that eat it with the soup and all? i don't know what happened to these contestants but them disliking the ramen because it has "water" in it makes me question if they've even been eating real ramen or not........ i do think i've seen other people eat ramen dry or just raw but if you eat it dry then where does all the flavor go??
hoe do you like ramen DRYYYY my sister(12 year old) does better ramen man 😂
Why did she say her mom is Spanish 💀
this is an insult to all ramen
as we’re calling her, “cheetah print girl” was so confident in herself, and then she got a 2. And she was talking about the color of the other girls ramen, like the color? really?
Olu: I prefer my ramen more dry.  *bites down on dry ramen brick*
all there ramen looks dry asf and uncooked
they’re pretty picky for broke College students🤔
dude talking mad shit☠️☠️☠️☠️
“It looks like a tsunami happened and this is the ramen” BRO WHAT 😂
That African girl was a hater just because.
5:35 all ramen should have water in it lol
Why with the spoon and it's not water not more it's called soup now
i was confused when i saw people with their DRY ramen, because as someone who has ramen as part of their culture, we eat it as a soup or atleast with sauce/broth
"you gotta put shrimp throughout the whole thing" aint yall supposed to be broke😨
Cheetah girl , Ramon seem the nastyest  lol if that’s a word ! But I don’t like dry noodles so that’s just me
If you’re going to destroy it, just add the correct amount of water and add their seasoning. Maruchan ramen is amazing without even doing anything to it, and gets better when you add good stuff to it. But if you’re going to sin and make nasty shit like this, leave it alone. I honestly think adding a bit of green onion gets the job done for a small boost of flavor. If you want to go fancier, you can. But don’t downgrade. 😭  Edit: Ramen is a soup-like dish. Meaning it should have liquid. 5:47 A tsunami didn’t hit that bowl of ramen, Mrs.Girl actually properly followed the instructions for that part.
That guy was hateful
I'm crying she represented it as Nigerian ramen 😭I'm ghanaian stay safe🤞
Ramen does make yuh boom
“shut down the studios..!” LOLLLL
Cheetah print girl got what she deserved for being cocky
Do they know anything about soup in ramen-? Like it makes me sad. why is there so much water? Also 6:44 like gurl look at urs
“It HaS wAtEr” shut up that’s how it’s supposed to be
Damn hyena too damn bougie 😂 nasty ass noodles
I cracked up when the Nigerian girl started crying 😆 🤣 😂
3:00
i dont want to be mean but i dont like it its salty LiKE ArE YOu TRYing tO kIIL mE
Is it too salty or is it not seasoned? make up your mind 😂
Those people don't know what ramen is... This is so painful
*"Are you trying to kill me?"*  At least I ain't putting bricks in my ramen
6:58 she was doin too much juss to get a 2😂😂 like girl.
man they all calling it ramen but my broke ass invested in an electric pot and I eat my noodles lavish. all of them look 0/10 to me but I'm Bengali and can't handle bad food (can't waste food either so I'd finish any of those if I'm served them)
where did the ramen soup go
😭😭you could tell they both liked that last ramen they just ain’t wanna admit to it cause they said it was probably gonna be nasty 😂
ITS BROTH. YOU IMBECILE’S YOU MORONS YOU BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS.
am i the only person who eats ramen with all the broth in a bowl
Bro they talking Abt they don't like they noodles with water in it THATS WHERE THE RAMEN GETS IT FLAVOR FROM
“i prefer my ramen a little more dry” and “why is it so watery it looks like a tsunami flooded” is physically PAINFUL to watch
Sad they only show people of color
Bro. I'm legit a middle schooler and ik how to make better ramen.
cheyrnne wins these people dont know what ramen shoukd taste like.
I feel kind of dissapointed as a asian person they said to much water its ramen. Ramen needs broth😭
For the people that that prefer their ramen to just be sitting in a pool of broth. You literally might as well drink warm water instead because that is literally what you're doing. Only difference is that you just chucked in a slab of noodles. Literally no flavor unless it's directly on the noodles and not sitting in f*cking broth. People that are relying on the broth are types of people that p*ss in a hot tub "just to add color".
affirmative action students more like it
i'm gonna fucking report
what the fuck you guy doing is fucking annoying you mother fuckers
I think the ramen was not cooked
marcus is fucking rude what
So only black people can be broke..and eat badly..where are the white, Latino, Chinese broke people..so dumb
The girl with overconfident
the most confident one had the worst dish XD
“I like my ramen a little more dry” 💀
Why tf did you give them a spoon and not a fork
people eat ramen…..without the soup?
bro my ramen would put them to shame.
"i would prefer my ramen a little more dry" yeah girl we can tell
i don’t get how they don’t know that ramen has water so the noodles can soak up more of the flavor and for like soup and its not supose to be in a clump
Do these kids not understand what ramen is? Lol
Why does everyone like dry ass ramen its so much better with the broath
They mustve picked the most weird outlying people to make ramen because ive never seen ramen like that ever
Is it just me who doesn't like the cheetah print girl--
The real question is why are they eating ramen with a spoon
I wanna see the cheetah print girls reaction after seeing the score😭
Sme:Naruto!
Idk bout yall but when I eat ramen its a whole ass soup. There's like a can of water in there lmao. What is this dry shit
here’s my ramen recipe because I make it a decent amount of times  1 cup chicken broth 1 cup water boil that  Add soy sauce, lime juice, chili paste, sesame oil, garlic salt, and pepper (and sesame seeds if you have any) Once the ramen is done cooking, add about half the packet of ramen seasoning  and you’re done sorry if it’s not authentic but I make this with whatever I can find in the house and I like it. Sometimes I add chicken too, but normally I cook this as a lazy meal so I will either use no meat or add some leftover meat whether it’s chicken, pork, or beef
Olu talking all that shit lol n hers was the worst thats what she gets 😂
Aha gungun yeah she Nigerian
“I like my ramen a bit more dry” we know gang
She talked hers up so much just for it to just be a broken up uncooked pack up of ramen 😭😭 Oh but “with so much different flavor that the other contestants don’t have”
where is the broth/water
I ate so much instant ramen in my college years that afterwards got peptic stomach ulcers that were bleeding and caused me to get really sick and puke blood for like half a year. 💀
Olu makes me mad 😭 she’s acting like her was some kinda of 5 star ramen
How hard is it to add red pepper powder onion and egg to ramen
The fact that they added BROKE in the title of the video
this just shows that all three of them dont know anything about ramen
The Nigerian girl was lowkey a hater for no reason and the guy had already made up his mind he wasn't going to like the ramens before he'd even tried them. sad
The Cheatah girl was insufferable conceited. But about the cheese thing he said.. adding a slice of american or cheddar cheese to some beef Raman with broth is pretty fire.
Bro then need some vegtables, fried egg, chili paste, etc. those are looking nasty as heck
The reason noodles clump is because it does over time get drier and not enough broth was absorbed while cooking to retain the normal consistency of the noodles
It was mad embarrassing for the cheetah pring girl talking mad shit talking hot asf n getting the worst rating bruh💀
Welp that ramen rly did come in with a dif taste and vibe 💀
I’ve never seen ramen look this weird in my life 😂
Who are these bums y'all got on the channel  🤣 the only one that even came close to being able to cook it was Che
Karma got that girl with the afro
how i make the best ramen ever in 5 steps  1. cook the ramen in water WITHOUT the flavor packet 2. drain all the water out and put it back in the pot 3. add 2 eggs and the flavor packet 4. stir while cooking and make sure the eggs are done 5. put in a bowl and eat
Why did they give them a spoon
This is the first time I ever seen anyone eat ramen with spoon only
slaaayyyy cheyene
Have they ever saw and tasted japanese ramen?? 🤣 it's all with broth!
they all did so much but all i do is put instant ramen on a boil and add a lil garlic powder, a square of butter to make the noodles silky and then i pour it in a big bowl pour a bit of water out and add the seasoning packet that it comes with..
Girlie it's instant ramen you follow the instructions on that package and it turns out perfect hun-
All three of them suck. Really? Not so creative that's why they broke. Its ramen, WTF whereis the broth? Ramen is the dish that goes so well any ingredients. For example buy a cheap box of MAMA and throw in two egg and some chopped chilies. Thats a good cheep ramen dish. You can even stir fry all kinds of ramen.
lol i know ramen in combination of some kind of soup with a hard boiled egg meat and vegetables but excuse me what the hack is that????
Sis tried to make Jollof ramen 💀
“I prefer my ramen more dry” Then why bother cooking it? Just eat the dry packaged version because the cooked version is SUPPOSED to have BROTH, BRO
Am I the only one who is failing to see the actual ramen all of it looks so dry she was talking about mushy I don't see no water no nothing no broth
all 3 are unlikeable
Too much water in ramen? Smh this nigga just offended all of Japan.
The winner was the on,y one who was actually nice there
I am sure the ramens are horrible but you guys, you are so funny and sympathic (hope i wrote it correctly, english is not my native language), and there's so much light in your eyes i will watch this again and again
Ugh I make the best ramen Ik, I wish I competed lmao
the girl in the tiger print thinks shes allll that, shes literally so dumb, like why does she try si hard to win💀 so stupid
WHERE TF IS THE BROTH?? RED FLAGGG 🚩🚩🚩🚩
why do they want dry ass ramen??????? it’s supposed to have BROTH that’s the whole point
*Naruto wants to know your location.*
I'm only 1/8 of the way in and I'm like all that ramen is going to be disgusting because it has to be ice cold at this point. I don't see any steam.
Shrimp on ramen is like 3 days almost but aye noodle is best if you have al dente noodles. But i dont like sriracha isnt good
Noodle consistency is real
I had a full ride scholarship and delved into using my classes to link my memory for courses for my neuralink  hyperloop infrastructure so i left at sophmore but i always had meals
Cheese sauce, meats, veggies, maybe eggs, al dente noodles
The dumbest people you will ever find at College - Musicians.
all of these suck lmao
This people are fuking weirdos Foreals
The girl who was called Oluwamayowa was letterly rolling her eyes and talking shit about others ramin and her ramen took the least rating😂😂
“Broke college kids”
I’m sorry but DID YALL EVEN READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE UR INSTANT RAMEN WTF IS THIS
Ramen is freaking soup bruh 🤣 Who tf eating dry noodles 🥴🥴🥴
WHERES THE BROTH
Did you guys not know how somewhat racist it sounds The had the channel named cocoa butter, and have it mainly dominated with Black people
ramen is supposed to have a broth(water)
Yall... RAMEN IS MENT TO HAVE BROTH WYDM ITS WATERY,
was this like a social experiment or sth? because why is olu acting like that💀💀
Yore right wHo eats Roman with spoon
The girl that got a 2 is a stush bitch
I’m sry but all of their attitudes out just not it
girl in the leopard print is SO ANNOYING
ramen is a soup 🧍🏼‍♂️ not them saying it’s watery when it’s a soup
All I wanted to see was the one girl who was very cocky react to her getting last that’s just funny to me you can’t be that cocky and get last with that total of 2 score
“but there’s water in it”  YEAH NO SHIT  “it’s too wet i like it more dry” SHUT
All of these look sad and dry lmao
I literally dislike the cheetah girl. She made me mad-
Honestly I would eat 5 bowls of Cheyenne’s ramen, but like without the shrimp cuz allergies 😍
To whoever is reading this Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon. All you need to do to be saved is believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was buried and came back to life on the 3d day. Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you’ll be saved! I hope to see you in the clouds! God blessl
Thats what me and my sisters did at the table when we were a little bit younger for like my age at this moment
Bro all of this ramen is trash
I hope cheetah print girl watches this back so she learns how to tone back the cockiness and get some broth for her ramen 😭
Lol "that sh*t look dry ashell"
its not even a lot of “water”
Could of at least found people that know how to make Rahman
Watching this while eating my basic cup noodles, and seeing them puzzled by broth
As an Asian American, I eat ramen on a daily and the third one was the most normal for me because I eat ramen with liquid in it because it keeps it’s flavor. But I’d love to try all three of them. I do eat dry ramen but I prefer soup ramen
As a blasian (black and asian) I'm so confused why two of the contestants don't like water in they ramen when look at this emoji 🍜. There is supposed to be broth in the noodles. To keep the taste. I love shrimp and lettuce ramen. I'm a college student myself and when I visit my mom sometimes she asks me to make her ramen. She helps with the decorations of the bowl because she is just a picky eater. And yeah I put a lot of spice in my ramen to numb my mouth if it don't taste good. My maman always makes hers amazing because it's ramen, she's a natural 😅. Anyways who doesn't want water in their ramen. Ramen is basically soup with noodles and if you are extra like me with shrimp or beef. Or even both 👍.
MUSICAL THEATRE REPRESENT
Bro, what are these ramen dishes? 😂🍜 Who makes stuff like this and confidently says they're gonna win? 😭
Did Cheetah print girl forget this episode was called “Broke college kids try ramen”?? What did she think she was on, “America’s Top Noodle Recipes?” Lmaooooo. Someone needs to humble her.
Why they are all black 😐 (just asking)
ima just eat regular chicken noddles
all they ramens look flavorless and dry as fuck😭💀 you gotta have some broth in there what are they doing?!?!
They don’t like drinking broth?!
Where's the broth....
why tf do they have spoons
Ya the womin like bro stop
The afro girl is kind of a bi×ch
They are all broke as shit and act like people put that much effort into fucking Ramen. Jeez, get over yourselves.
These guys don’t know what ramen is
I knew my Nigerian sista was losing when she said she added crayfish. Nigerians LOVE dry indomine lol
Im kinda mad theres no broth in these ramen. I cant eat ramen noodles and drain the broth like huh😭
Did Olu even cook hers tbh💀
that girl w the long sleeved shirt is an L
why in the name of jesus and mohammad are they eating this with a spoon
Cheyenne won but let’s be real that aint no broke college student meal… u know how much shrimp cost?
Shout out to the shrimp 😁
“I would prefer my ramen more dry” oh girl…we know
Marchuan ok trust me take beefthe Raman boil it if a pot on the stove then  fry an egg and pop the yolk in the bowl mix it up top with green onion and a lot a lot a lot of Louisiana hot sauce I know it sound Jane but just try it
olu called marcus ramen too dry and she says cheyenne's was too wet and she likes hers very dry so like bro make up your mind
WE NEED THAT ATATAGOON!
Do people not understand what ramen is? The water is surprising?
The afro girls ramen I'd what happens to mine if I completely fuck up and forget I've got ramen on the hob or microwave and am mad as hell but still eat it. She does that on purpose?
I went to make some ramen while watching this… smh… this video gave me bad juju! I got distracted and ruined it! 🤣
Where is the broth???
How can yall mess up RAMEN…
Ramen mek dem boom
For me, instant ramen (like the very basic ramen) lowkey doesn’t taste good with a lot of water. I like to keep some water, but not a lot bc it’s super salty, and very not broth-like. But for real ramen or Korean Ramyun (don’t come at my spelling idk if that’s how it’s spelled) the broth with those noodles are just 🤌🏼🤌🏼
Literally I'd rather eat the ramen crushed up and dry with the seasoning than eat their ramen. Lol.
Wow olu was obnoxious
Damn the girl with the cheetah print be making everything about her though-
The cheeta print girl got on my nerves for putting the others down saying this is gross shoutout to this that saved the day when here ramen was not even done cooking and had been sitting out there in the sun
ooooOOOF that was embarassing to watch olu im sorry but u were wayyy too overconfident and also RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOUP ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DRY THE "DROWNED" RAMEN DOESNT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH SOUP IN IT
Bro the nigerian girl is going to grow up and become a karen broo
Are they actually broke?!
Why are they using a spoon?? Use a fork🤚🤨
None of them win, all of them where terrible. Like do you guy's even know what ramen is ??? Issa soup with broth. You can be broke and not eat like a 3 year old trying to make ramen.
The “my moma told me if u something bad to say don’t say it at all” killed me😂
isn't ramen supposed to have a broth? americans are so weird
Why is there no broth? 🥴
Do these people know what real ramen is..? They are complaining about broth..? What..? These people are… what…?!?!
'I prefer my ramen a little dry' Yeah, we can tell
I’m shocked that only one person had their ramen ‘slimy’ (as the other contestants said) thats how it’s supposed to be . Tf?
the one girl knew that the other girls ramen was the best but then she was mad bc she thought hers was the best but it was actually rly bad
Y’all definitely would’ve love mine 🥴
All of the ramen looks dry
Who else thinks there ramen is the best after this video
All 3 of them is Eatin it allll wronggggg y’all need some Mexicans on yall show
This is what happens when you have 0 Asians participate in this challenge 💀 mofos don’t even realize that ramen has broth
How to make ramen use beef or chicken broth or veggie broth get sum hot sauce or and thing u want chicken and get a sunny side egg that yolk boostes the ramen softness
Pro tip on how to make instant ramen: READ THE FUC*ING INSTRUCTIONS. And put an hard boiled egg on top :)
seems like cheyenne is the only one here who knows how to eat ramen
Bro is that the girl from the Netflix guessing show 🗿🗿🗿🗿 Like broooo.. Tell me I’m wrong.. She look like the girl from the show where you gotta lie or tell the truth☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
The way that one girl said ramen i was trying not to throw up
the girl with the cheetah shirt was very confident but girl- the way it looked. she was rude calling everyone else ramen bad but hers was the worst. and on the other hand MARCUS THOUGH he is SOOOOO RUDE
My maruchan has valentina, limon, and salt  That shit taste bomb especially the broth when it’s still hot with a cold drink AHH
Cheetah Lookin Ah: “Mines coming with a different vibe different taste mines going to win bring it on” *five seconds later* Marcus: “Yo this sh*t dry as hell.”
I hate the way she says crawfish
why r they complaining abt the broth 😭
none of them know how to make ramen ;-;
That girl Nigerian yessirrrrrr
I think they don't know what 'ramen' is
I’m 10 making better ramen then them.
It’s always the people who are so overly confident and they put everyone else’s down but their always the people who have the worst food 😅
Bruh why is everyone being so extra. ITS RAMEN
The one girl said it was so salty then said there wasn’t any flavor 🤔🤣
Shoot us indians used to eat that straight out of the package! 🤝
Pye ef 💯
Bruh if ramen matters why didn't you eat all of it
Bro can this animal print woman PLEASE shut up she is so cringe
Let’s get this straight non Asian folk people. It’s rah-men not rAmen. Also if you are cooking it in the microwave you have lost in my book. If your ramen is white with no fucking color I will not be eating it. Let’s add some veggies bell pepper I like to add kimchi the chili comes off the cabbage so double good. No broth = no opinion.
tHiS iS CuLtUrAl ApPrOpRiAtIon
Bitch said: It's just like mine except he added chicken   Then said: the only thing with flavor in here is the chicken    Okay so you just admitted yours sucks
"I like my ramen a bit more dry"  _Yeah we can tell_
Literally every time someone acts like they are the best they do horribly. Without fail. How do you even complain about the salt level in ramen anyway,has she literally never had it before?
At 5:37 I thought ramen was supposed to be made and served with a broth or covered in a sauce and not be dry (DEFINITION: quick-cooking noodles, typically served in a broth with meat and vegetables) btw im not saying she isn’t allowed to eat it dry I just think it’s wired that non except one had a broth like thing ya know?
does it gonna kill ya if you bring other than colored people to the reaction vids i mean im Arab but this shit is outta control
Only one of them can be called ramen  Like where’s the broth bro
“I’m not tryna be mean buuuut…”   ITS SO SALTY ARE YOU TRYNA KILL ME  it’s not seasoned enough
Olu just saying she’s gonna win for sure when she got the lowest rating
Bro I’m 14 and can cook better ramen 💀
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon-
Bro you’re supposed to eat it with the broth 😭
these people take ramen way too seriously
"I prefer my Ramen a little bit more dry" yeah we noticed
Shrimp and oyster sauce? That don't sound "broke" to me at all😂
The term “broke and college” in one sentence baffles me
That Nigerian girl is a fraud. How you say its salty then all of a sudden it became unseasoned and mushy.
I would eat Cheyenne’s ramen! It looks so good!!!
People complain so much about being a broke college student but the don’t realize they just adopted the brokeness  I was born in it 😈
I've never seen anyone eat noodles with just a spoon
Flavour and colour my butt it looks like you threw it into a pot just plain let it cook until the water evaporated and let it stay there and never bothered to eat it.
2nd girl her ramen crusty musty rusty dusty it has been sitting on the counter ever since in was undercooked three weeks and tryed to convince herself it was good because it was the last packet.
What a cute video idea, love it
How is it salty but doesn’t have taste
All three are over smart
“It’s salty”  10 seconds later…  “Season the ramen”
All I’m saying is who eats ramen with a spoon, ig you can’t expect much from them
These people were never broke lol
Bro she really had clumps of noodles and said she liked hers dry like girl I don’t even see the spice😭🚪👉🏽
I feel like the first two people have never seen anyone else make ramen ever like it's supposed to have broth😂
Some of u here arent American. In America the ramen they buy is actually instructed to have soup cause ita imported from Asia. Its not "just japanese" "just korean". Yall fr gatekeeping top ramen? Damn.
Why are they surprised that her ramen came with the soup? Even most packet ramens suggest a ramen soup, why would you want dry ass, clumpy noodles? Even just a bit of garam masala bangs on packet noodles.
All of them are bugging bro just use the regular Ramen with the sauce it gives you and then add an egg or some pork or shrimp why are they trying so hard
Dude you gotta add the contestants reacting to the scores at the end that would make these videos even better than they are now, or I'm being dumb and you do that in your more recent videos in that case ignore this
Maybe you’re a “Broke College Student” because you’re eating a $20 bowl of ramen
How can you eat Ramen crunchy that’s so weird bro….and Ramen is supposed to be with broth
Lmao yes! Put cocky cheetah girl in her place!
The cheetah girls noodles are dryer than the Sahara desert.
Omg she asked why the noodles were so mushy as she's smashing them down lol
I only clicked because of the Thumbnail lol
The thumbnail was golden
This the sign you've been waiting for. Jesus is coming soon.He loves you. He lived, died and resurrected for you and I. Accept Him and be Saved. Repent and Preach the Gospel before it’s too late. “For God so loved the world that His Only Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” John 3:16  “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” Revelation 22:12
i love how the person talking about other people saying she was going to win and everyone else’s was not better than hers and then she got the most insults about her ramen
“I like my ramen a little bit DRY”  *yeah we can tell*
They are so mean to each other 😭😭
cheetah print girl was so cocky and she got humbled real quick
"Its salty are you trying to kill me" says it like they put 543363646473 bottles of salt
How she say it was salty ? Then say the only seasoned thing is the chicken, add some seasoning to it… wtf 🤔
Always the ones who talk the most shi have the worst food
"It looks kinda dead" LMAO ITS RAMEN
Dey gon hop off my dawg Cheyenne 😒
Olu was pissing me off she was too judgy for her stuff to be the worst one lol
Cheyenne… I don’t like fish but yours looked like ramen! And THANK YOU for not crumbling up the noodles! Lol
Ramen is served with soup. The other two people are delusional
Ramen❌ Remen✅
Is nobody ignoring the fact that they are eating with SPOON?
“i prefer my ramen more dry” :| girl we know
It's funny how the one with the worst reviews is talking all like she is proper and queen of ramin tasting lmao. Cringe
Sorry but you three made the nastiest ramen ive ever seen
I feel like they were all very judgmental because they knew their dish was being judged too and of course they all wanted to win. Would love to see this video with a non biased standpoint tasted by random people who didn’t partake in making a dish.
This confirms my opinion American kids can't cook.
All black ? Not very diverse 😂
People ramen is a Japanese noodle SOUP. You cannot have dry ramen. You can have dry noodles but without broth it is NOT ramen.
5:38 yeah we can tell you prefer it dry 💀
I like the water 💧 in my ramen 🍜 and i do like it without it to but all of them look good besides the cheetah print girl
Just make sure water is rapid boiling before adding in ramen then bring it back to rapid boiling then turn timer to 3mins to ensure noodles are fully done u don't want it to taste doughy
Ramen can be broken up and ate like crunchy chips   Or u could add in an egg and slice of cheese in ramen noodles with some broth is yum   Try with some chili powder in it for a spicy kick   Try using 2 cups of water with some boulin cubes chicken or beef or a mix of the 2 for broth then add in some pickle juice and a diced pickle and a friend egg with cheese is yum   And to add on to that if u want Try steak em meat ,cheese onions and mix bell peppers with some mushrooms a died up pickles  and seasoning packet and a dash of horseradish sauce mixed it all together don't dump the broth its good and delicious could save it for next time u make ramen or drink it as a tasty snack tastes just like philly cheesesteak it's so extremely good and delicious   If u don't like the packet find a empty small container with Lid mix 1 tbs of onion powder garlic powder, minced dried onions ,chives celery seed ,kosher salt,  black pepper ,chicken and steak seasoning  lemon pepper, chili powder, paprika, jerky and mix everything together and add bout half of a tbsp to a tsp depending on what flavor u going for
He said her ramen was like a mouthful of mushy Saltine crackers.
"It's too watery" mfs that what ramen is, it aint Mi Goreng
They all look awful.
I woulda been that video with a bowl of ramen and tapatio in hand and said “here’s my ramen”
The first girls name reminded me of omaewumushinderu😂
I guess they're too broke to afford water if they're so surprised by the broth....
How the actual hell did they go this many years without knowing what noodles look like?
I wanna tell them to cope in their face when they complain
God bless Cheyenne for being a decent human
damn yall really be pressed abt cheeta girl 💀 it’s not that deep
Im more of a cup noodles type of person so seeing their ramen without any broth was actually kinda odd idk
Idk why but the rude leopard print girl's ramen seemed staged
Ugh😒 why does everyone always pour the juice out. 😡😡 Those dry ass noodles.
Ight imma say this once but none of these looked good 🤣
first off who the hell likes their cooked ramyeon dried unless they’re children ??
I wish there was a Japanese person too in this video 😂
Everyone is just gonna ignore that the producers are roasting the young adults?
So is nobody gon say nothing bout them eating ramen with a SPOON 🥄 ?
Why don't they have ANY WATER. PLEEAASE
im sick.....the broth is the best part of ramen and allows the seasonings to really permeate the noodles.....seek help all of u besides cheyenne....
The women wearing cheetah print was acting a bit too cocky. Imagine acting like Gordon Ramsey over something as small as Ramen.
It’s always the one that talks that’s food sucks
Cheyenne put shrimps in her broke collegue student ramen??? They are so expensive in my country and I though they are expensive in other countries too T.T
Idk what the other two were on but Cheyenne was a boss because HERS WAS RAMEN idk what the other twos were that can’t even be considered ramen there’s was stuff with noodles RAMEN IS A SOUP PEOPLE BROTH DUDES
ngl they all look so colorless and bland
I got the best Roman recipe ever just buy chicken flavored Roman and just cook it nothing else
They stay havin that one hater!
😎 water noodles
cheetah girl the type of person to do a dna test and be 1% african and base their whole personality around it.
The cheeta print girl. She I don’t know anymore but . NOT every thing has to have color like???????????
You can tell as soon an the First Lady didn’t like the dudes ramen that she was gonna have the worst one.
You can tell as soon an the First Lady didn’t like the dudes ramen that she was gonna have the worst one.
the lady with a afro has a big ego
I literally lived off of creamy chicken ramen and if I was lucky, butter toast for a year in college. My Aunt would take me to Walmart to get a case of ramen, butter and bread. I had MAYBE 3 meals a week (not days, but single meals) that weren’t ramen. But it was always good! Butter the bread THEN toast it and put the ramen on the toast lol. But I gained the freshman 15 so quick lol.
none of them were ramen wheres the broth bruh
*it has water it looks like it flooded* you sure have ate ramen
why they eating that shit with a spoon? 🤣
Yeah i know i already made two comments idc im back a year older to say, first lady still mad annoying 💀 Edit: 😭 and she said some “next 🤓” girl its the end of the video fym next
“It has water in it..” SIS THATS WHAT RAMEN IS 😭
I feel so much better going through these comments and reinforcing that I’m not crazy and that Ramen does have broth and that these people are weiirrddd with their dry ass ramen. Whew 😥
All of a sudden they ramen experts

Oh my goodness when I really did full-time college I was living on potatoes and corn flakes not even the good corn flakes the one with the rooster on it
wasnt anybody botherd by them eating ramen with spoon like chopsticks or even a fork but spoon

I feel like the cheetah girl loves herself more than anything and she has confidence like-💀💀
It always be the loudest, rudest ones that got the most trash cooking lmao
Cheetah girl is like the grandma, from the Sweet Potato pie LMAO 💀
Olu:”It has a little bit of water in which is OK I guess, but I prefer my ramen a bit more dry”  GIIIRRLL YOURS IT LITERALLY IN CHUNKS!!
Im confused why they eating ramen w a spoon
Both Ladies are hot AF! but i hate ramen.
the girl who actually had broth in her ramen, what she made was RAMEN. ion even think u can call the shit the others made ramen bro wtf
She said the ramen was salty but said the chicken is the only thing with seasoning 🤣 she was hating from the start 🤣
Uhh you’re literally supposed to use water for ramen…right?! I like the soup
0:41 you have to pay for the buses parking, what?
Thats so cool her name Her name is "oluwamayowa" and my names "oluwafunmilola"
"If you can find ways during the struggle to make your ramen like really good" Follow the instructions on the packet.
I love how they're food critics for Ramen noodles lol
Do they know that ramen is *MEANT* to be drunken with broth not dry aѕ ғυcĸ or ѕlιgнтly weт, especially when it's hot and you didn't or can't make tea at least you will get something Hot on your sᴛᴏᴍᴀᴄʜ ƪ(‾.‾“)┐    In all honesty all of them look bad......maybe expect for the Sensitive girl who called out her mama but other then that,     ᴀnd sorry if this is hash but ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ғᴜᴄᴋ ɪs ᴛʜᴀᴛ ʏᴏᴜ ᴄᴀʟʟᴇᴅ ᴛʜᴀᴛ sʜɪᴛ нoмeмιх ʀᴀᴍᴇɴ!? ┐(ﾟдﾟ┐)
Cheetah print girl was like mine is the it’ll win her getting 2
Where the Asian at
who’s gonna tell them that you’re SUPPOSED to put water in the ramen
These guys are such bad and picky cooks
That cheetah print girl was so rude omg and her ramen was the worst 😅😭
DO THEY EVEN KNOW WHAT RAMEN IS
wait so are you or are you not supposed to eat ramen with the soup/water in it bc I do
I’m getting second hand embarrassment for the cheetah shirt girl
The cheetah print girl said that markuses ramen was dry like girl the only thing that’s dry is your makeup damn
Is no one gonna talk about how one of them said there mom is Spanish?
HAHA only said some mean things and got karma in return
i hate that curly hair girl bro she such a bztxh honestly
As a Nigerian who has lived here my whole life, I’m concerned for the girl with the curly hair😭
That Nigerian girl thought she’d to do well
It taste salty! *A minute later* It has no flavour!
These Africans need to respect Asian food better wtf
So basically when they say they like their "ramen" a bit dry they mean their "instant noodles". Ramen is a soup but I guess Americans call the instant noodles packets all ramen 🙄
이고 뭐야......These people should never cook ramen again this is pure disrespect ☠️☠️☠️
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon…… it’s understandable if they don’t wanna use chopsticks, but come on. A spoon?!!?
the most critical person always has the worst thing
These people made me itch… Ramen is a soup
It's shocking to me that people eat Ramen without soup. Like have you ever eaten non soup Ramen when it's not fresh off the stove? Nasty.
Shrimp with broke college kids? How about lobster then?
it looks like they ramen needs more flavor and color and water ngl
Oh nah they did not drain the broth
Bruh ramen is meant to be eaten as a soup, why are they talking as if it’s supposed to be eaten dry
eating ramen with a spoon.
Where’s my asian people at for this one ⁉️
I always use a fork to eat my ramen

Who tf has dry ramen
yo wassup marcus
Bra I just dump hot sauce in mine
It’s salty AF...... season the rameeeennn 🥱
have they never seen broth ramen? like “it’s too watery” that’s what broth ramen is…
Everyones looks disgusting. Why does everyone lack soup in the ramen
gotta say, all the ramen looked pretty wack, and although cheyenne's looked ok, it still looked pretty wack.
Why do people gripe about the broth in ramen noodles that's the way they're made it's called ramen noodle soup you're supposed to have broth
Are we talkin bout ramen or pasta? Cuz like ramen shouldn't be dry af-IT HAS BROTH HUN
I wanted to see olu reaction to her score. You’ve deprived me of the sight of disappointment. I’m disappointed.
Y’ALL CANT AFFORD WATER TO MAKE THE RAMEN LESS DRY 💀💀
Um I think ramen was supposed to have water and they were like “too much water” or “I’d prefer it dry”
The way the girl was talking about the other dude and then there like:🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨👹👹👹
the african chick is a jerk
do they know that ramen is soup???
UCR!!!
Why are they all black. Like what you trying to say.
You eat ramen with broth…….
Lmao the way she said ramen “remmmen”
The girl with the afro really thought she was gonna win with all her fancy spices and everyone just hated it. Cockiness is never key to anything.
that mfin cheetah mf used everything except for water lmao "nigerian style"
Them first two ramen is different. They wildin
I can’t stand dry ramen. I always have it with the broth
Uhm ramen is supposed to have broth of course it’s watery
I feel like Olu might think of ramen as another kind of pasta you completely drain and eat "dry" with ofcourse a sauce and seasoning of choice. But ramen is supposed to be brothy. It's noodle soup
bro why did that one ramen bowl have clumps-
It’s satisfying that everyone hates hers l
ramen's supposed to have water *aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh*
the girl that got 2 deserved it
watery watery I'm pretty sure everyone except the ponytail girl doesnt know what ramen is
They all get a 0 for eating that shit with a fucking spoon
NOBODYS GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW THEY NOT USING A FORK LIKE REALLY THEY GAVE THEM A SPOON💀
They really gave y’all spoons to eat ramen noodles
As someone who eats Ramen daily the Cheetah print girls Ramen *pained me bro*
instant ramen is not RAMEN, not everyone likes it watery tho.
Are they eating ramen with spoons 😭
Cheetah print Is annoying
Dude that girl is soooo judgy like holy crap she acted like hers was soooo great
they eating noodles witta spoon this gotta be illegal
muh-ROO-chin
“This shi dry as hell” he is my favorite literally speaking facts😭
Marcus lying bro I can tell he liked cheyannes he just wanted to rate her low  so he won but even when he did rate her low she still one
it has to have water 😭😭😭 you have to boil it ..
this kids don't have ANY ideea on how to make ramen
if there’s one thing i gotta say pls for the love of god don’t add crayfish to ramen pepesoup is perfect for that but not ramen… 😭😭
Noone like soup with their ramen?? Yall is boring
Some Black people: white people can’t season their food  Some Black people:
Ramen is supposed to have the juice or”water” in it 😭😭😭😭
I prefer my ramen dry: yes we know💀
Ramen is supposed to be “watery” 😂 Cheyenne wins immediately for making it correctly. I don’t think that ramen is supposed to be dry lmao.I like to put random spices that I have in the cabinet in my ramen, ya know? It just depends on how I’m feeling, I also like to sometimes add a sunny-side-up egg in there as-well.
The cheetah print girl is really annoying
Sometimes I’ll use chicken buillon instead of the seasoning packet or add an egg but that’s about as fancy as I get with my ramen.
To bad they didn't have a variety of people,  there are other ethnicities that are struggling/broke in college...
Editor is a G 😂😂
Bro the cheetah print girl, was  hyping her ramen up the entire video just for it to taste like trash, and she has the audacity to give out tips.
omf oli is fr so annoying bruh she like a critic so annoying
making the thing normally would be 10x better
Where is the broth? Also why does everyone’s ramen look bland? Is it the lighting? Why is the ramen being eaten with a spoon? Are we being pranked?
What Muyiwa cooked was indomie not ramen 🍜 that’s why the others didn’t like it 😂😂
Why did they put broke in the title 😭😂
It genuinely blows my mind that these children can't fathom ramen with BROTH.
Just use Korean Ramen packets..
UB
What the hell! like I only ever eat Roman with the soup and Noodles or Raman dry just became a things some time ago and you guys have the audacity to say that that did you never know that Roman or noodles were made with soup . two of the recipes what kind of crumpy that's disgusting that's not Roman. You guys can try Maggi or Kannur they are one of the best noodles out there. And I also think that there is a seasoning packet in the Raman so you don't need to completely change it just add some veggies whatever you like.
“I don’t like water in my ramen” dude, HAVE YOU SEEN REAL RAMEN!??
The guy added chicken to his Ramen.... CHICKEN!!!????!!!! Add that to anything you're getting a 10😭😭
God damn that girl pissed me of so much. I think you know wich on I'm talking about 😤😤😤
I would make some ramen fry ofc 🤪 then I’d make a pork chop and eat it with it 😍
Cheetah girl: I like my ramen a little bit more dry Me: mmmm a little
What's the obsession with ata gungun? I had to google it. Chilli pepper, and it's that thing she fixates on
Can we have these same people try real authentic ramen?????
once i saw the clump of ramen i said that is a different vibe🧍🏾
I’m so glad I found this channel!
"I would prefer my ramen more dry."  Girl made ramen nugets instead of ramen be quiet
3:56 didn't she read how long you cook the ramen?
"Ramen" I thought this video was how they make instant noodles differently, not this abomination.
The way the other two were hatin on Cheyenne saying that the ramen needs to be dry💀💀💀💀
Help💀 ramen suppose to be watery its soup base, the other ramen were so dry wtf💀🤦‍♀️
Who else cook ramen as dry as Sahara desert🏜️☠️🤣
I would always make my ramen with broth so it will still be moist. (but then not drink the broth at all.)
the cheetah girl is like one of my classmates at school
???? Crayfish???? Shrimp????    [Broke College Kids Try Each Other's Ramen]
ramens supposed to have broth...💀
I just wanna know why they were eating it with a spoon??? No forks or chopsticks?
Ramen is a soup so it's supposed to have water in it 🍜 and not be Dry ASF looking like someone just chewed it up n spat it back into the plate n put it in the fridge for 24 smdh.
OMG that African girl needed 2 shut up. She was overly confident over nothing WTF 😆😂🤣😭💀
Me and Cheyenne have the same name accept mine is spelt chyanne
Man these were some weak ramen dishes
1: you dont use a spoon to eat noodles  2: if you adding shrimp, then u were NOT broke.  3: ramen is ment to have broth n be soupy, its not spaghetti kiddos.
ya tellin me these people think water/broth doesn’t belong in ramen ?? man ian even in college yet but what is thiiss
Why no soup?
they all looked awful
Bro Cheyenne would have taken the cake so much more if she drained them noodles a bit before adding the seasoning, would have had so much more flavor
COME ON WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW US THE CHEETAH PRINT PERSON'S REACTION TO THEIR SCORE
girl in the cheetah print had a LOT to say about the other peoples ramen, i wanna see her reaction when she realized she got a 2
I don’t understand why none of these people Cook the noodles🧐, wait a minute, now I see the only one who didn’t cook it was the Leopard print girl… ummm… Did she just said she was smelling it to make sure nothing bad was on it?! Girl u literally didn’t Even cook the ramen😳
Olu is the type of girl to think she’s better then anybody else💀
WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON
oh wow young people are so fucking weird
who the fuck eat ramen without the broth bro
Why they be using a spoon
Chop up some cheap weenies, zap your ramen noodles in a cup for three mins, while it’s cooling down , zap your sliced weenies for 30-45 seconds, pour the cup of noodles in a bowl, throw in the weenies, stir to mix, then add tony chaceres, stir some more and mix, and once you are done eating the noodles and weenies, the liquid left behind will be a nice gumbo style rue flavor that you will enjoy drinking .
Idk How They Eating Ramen With Absolutely No Water In It..Like Wtf Is Going On😭😭
I knew no one would like Olu’s 💀 girl was so arrogant
All their ramen 🍜 is dry asf
they have never had real ramen before...
Sooooooooooooooo yall don't like juice in y'all ramen???🙃🤔
What the fuck is up with the no broth ramen people out there in the world shits not pasta it’s soup
bro my ramen would beat them all
Why the hell did you give them spoons?
Everyone makes their ramen differently and I kinda dig that. I remember when I was younger my friend making me ramen her way-she takes ALL THE WATER OUT and puts the seasoning in, not equal distribution at all, makes the noods hella salty. Apparently that was the point.  For me I cut up a piece of garlic, add a lil bit of Mayo-sometimes a soft boiled egg or a fried egg with a runny yolk (and if you didn’t know yolk helps make your soup taste kinda creamy) sometimes I just eat it straight out of the packet no cooking necessary.
why do they not just make it as a soup like youre suppsoed to
They all looked nasty... 5 min on youtube and you can find 10 better ways to make a nice instant Ramen..
It’s not water it’s broth
Olu gotta learn respect
ramen is supposed have water??
Y’all made Ramen dry af
The girl in the cheetah print said she didn’t like they guys bc it was DRY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
zebra girl:the ramens to watery it his a lot of water  me: yeah no shit sherlock
Battyman like ramen..
I knew from the start the girl in the leopard print was gonna be a bitch and then look at here food I mean come on
A big yikes for the cheetah print lady
yall we do not claim cheetah girl as a ramen noodles cookerrrrrrr
THE SPOON
3:01 why she got mayo in her name
Them broke college kids probably got paid to do this lol
I’m from the hood so I love noodles. I went to a PWI college & they always judged my noodle for being like soup & not being dry. I feel like ppl forget that noodles should be like soup/pho not spaghetti.
Who the hell drains their ramen??? The flavor is in the broth
Where’s the broth? Ya want to get full when ya broke then don’t throw the broth away.
some people just to full of their self  and btw every person id different so like pat down cheetah print
As an Asian person who's body composition is noodles, watching other people make their "top ramen" is unimpressive, but I'll give an A for originality.
ramen is supposed to be severed with the… like water stuff-  i only know the ilocano word for it
You are supposed to have water in ramen 😑
They clearly don't know too much about Asian culture "It's too watery."  Girl wtf 😭And who eats ramen with a spoon-
Oh my goodness man YOU EAT RAMEN WITH BROTH so dont act like its weird man
Man ever since I learned how to make ramen more like the Asian way, I never looked back and never bothered with that seasoning packet ever again. That’s probably why they don’t care for the “broth” because that broth created by the seasoning packet is just not good. Never cared for it myself. These kids need to try real ramen.
This ought to be embarrassing for America.
The who talks trash the most gets the lowest rating the one who was nice got highest rating
Dry ramen 🤨🤨🤨
Forget the food.. they weird for using spoons
It’s funny hearing them say, “there’s water in it”… If you not eatin ramen with the soup, you eatin it all wrong. It’s an Asian dish so take notes n eat it properly. With ramen tho, the key to keep it from tasting “slimy” like the guy said, cook the noodles “Al Dente” n separate the noodles from hot soup n only til you’re ready to eat is when you pour the hot soup over the noodles cause if you let the noodles sit in the hot soup, it’ll keep cooking n eventually make the noodles taste… “slimey” n we dnt want slimey lol
mfs like dry af ramen broth the best part
All their ramen looks like ass lmfao why did they drain the broth ?! That’s all the flavor. This is killing me  Like mine would of had the broth , chili garlic paste , boiled egg cut in half and that’s all you really need if money is tight BUT to be fair, it looks like it was left untouched for quite a while. Should of had them make it right before filming.
Them dry noodles didn’t pass the assignment
Ok but why are they eating ramen with a spoon
ThErE USING a SpOoN TO EAT THE RAMEN. WHAT THE FU-
I like my instant ramen just the good ol’ fashion way with the beef seasoning, noodles, and the broth that’s it.
That man talking so much shit when all he did was add dry chicken to his
A bowl of bread crumbs 😂😂😂😂
I can eat a whole box of crackers by myself like how are they poor and cant make ramen? Like i grew up so poor we aint have sauces and shit like that all we was able to do was use the packet it came with lived off it for like 4 years of my childhood parents wasn't ever around so we made ramen on a hot plate we had cuz the stove didnt work didnt have a microwave and had to shower with pans of water on a hot plate
Can this girl with the afro can she stop dissing bruh she had the worst rating
Thank you for the one women who actually had the broth with it
Why tf all their ramen look like mushy turds tbh
Mayowa, you have disappointed us in Nigeria. you dont know how to cook. all you know is ATA GUNGUN and CRAYFISH. like wtf was that atrocity. lmaooooo please we are recalling you back home for further investigation. Report to the embassy immediately
yall are eating your ramen dry??
Why tf y'all eating Raman with a spoon, wtf- Also holy $h*t, y'all need cooking lessons 😳
uwu me borke uwu 🥺🥺
The girl with the Leopard print top on won’t stop bragging and it’s really annoying me. You’re not better then anyone sweetie.
cheetah girl you seriously need to get over yourself lmao
The whole point of ramen is the soup it’s out soup it’s just noodles
These people are all terrible at making ramen
They eatin ramen wit a spoonXD💀
i boil the water in the kettle i get my ramen i add the hot water the put seasoning and the suace stuff bc then it creates broth. afterwards i like to crack an egg in and cook some shrimp with it along side with some vegetables bc the egg might not have cooked properly i like mine a bit yolky so i put it in the microwave for like 30secs
i can make better ramen than all of them im 11..
all you gotta do to make a good ramen is keep it simple once you start adding extra shit that doesnt mix well you messed up
the girl with the pony tail when trying Marcus's ramen: wow this is good and well seasoned the girl with the afro when trying Marcus's ramen: ArE YoU TrYiNg To KiLl Me !??!!?!?!
Cursed I say.
the cheetah girl was trying to make herself win by giving low points she also seems so 2 faced
If you don't like ramen you're Japanphobic.
It genuinely bothers me when people eat dry ramen. It's a soup that comes with a broth. ;-;
These mfs really found ramen with broth , strange and WATERY
Lmaoo these kids man
Lmaooo why did all of theirs look gross? 😭
I don’t like that that girl kept being like my Ramen is the best and all these other Ramen suck no matter what Like to stop being like that
Dayum. I mean a lot of those sound very different from the way this broke white boy makes ramen but i mean for real the shrimp one and the chicken one sounds good but if i could make ramen the way i eat it. One looked like it was still crunchy, one looked like it had all the water poured out before the seasoning was added, and the other looked like ramen soup. They all three might be better than the regular broke dude might make. Like, if you are eating ramen you probably cant afford shrimps. Chicken is more realistic though. And that rotisserie chicken can make ramen go through the roof. I like my ramen different every time i make it so wether its dry or soup im down either way.
"Mine diffinitely came, and did what it needed to do." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"They were wrong by COOKING...PERIOD!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ramen is. Supossed to half water in its called broff and it adds flavour to it
The one with the afro not liking anyone else's when she had the worst one
Wow man I will say wit h one is best I'm the master of ramen
marcus got humbled rq by that ramen
Yall get a dislike for useing spoons lol
All they shi look nasty and dry
Marcus: “is that cheese”  Me: …. (Only eats cheese when its in ramen)
“i prefer my noodles a bit more dry” yea we can tell…
But a Asian person here it will imrppove
Olu was arrogant af
If you use the seasoning packet make sure it has msg, if not make sure you add a lil msg. (Asian grocers) I'm telling you!
Why use a spoon with noodles
I did not mean to say that I meant I said If you're gonna make ramen Not grow women
If you all grow woman it's gonna have broth That's just how it is Like it's not made with chunks that's just nasty and it's not supposed to be dry ramen is like ramen Comes naturally from Japan it was originated in china and Asian places if That's just how it is it is what it is
Olu babe. Humble yourself.
My Ramen recipe: Pack of Spicy Shin Ramyun ramen(Red or black), sliced beef, egg, teriyaki sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, and alittle bit of sugar
I love how they were complaining about the “watery” ramen but like isn’t ramen soup?😭😭
Cheyenne’s is the most culture accurate for sure 👍
not them using a spoon to eat RAMEN
The cheetah print girl acted like her ramen was the best and she was going to win but she ended up being last place lolz 😂😂😂
bro…it’s soup based ramen ofc it’s gonna be “watery” not dry💀💀
why are they put off by water?? ramen is a fuckin noodle soup tf do you think ramen is??
Y’all really gave them spoons instead of a fork…
Why are they eating it with a spoon..
I mean you can get 4 to 6 ramen in one pack from dollar tree for a 1.99$ so in the future when I become a college student the dollar tree will be looking mighty fine.
Who eats ramen with a spoon 💀
movie boo
this look dry as hell😂
They can't be talking about nobody cuz all of the Romans look nasty
I love Cheyenne
I wonder how the cheetah girl react to this video
Ong the guy has no chill
Her ramen is dryer than volcanic ash
IM SORRY BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THAT THE RAMEN WASNT COLORED? 😭
5:35 OH NO REALLY?????? IN RAMEN??? A SOUP LIKE MEAL??? THAT TRADITIONALLY COMES WITH -BROTH-???
Always the person the talks the most crap that has the worst
the third girl said the ramen looks dead bro hers was straight up a corpses
The girl who can’t cook got some nerve
“i would prefer my ramen a little more-“ dry. we know
Hell fucking nahhh they said "its a bit watery" broo it's supposed tk have broth what thee hell are they onn
Cheetah print girl was like:  It's dry, I don't like it, and then later said she prefers it dry? And " It's too salty " to " It doesn't have any seasoning " Like, girl what 💀
"i prefer my ramen more dry" yea we know
Ngl I can definitely make a better ramen than y’all
She said season the ramen then says it’s too salty 😭
“Season the ramen. The ramen matters!!” Me: “Girl didn’t you just say it was TOO salty?”
If everyone was nice, i would’ve liked the video.
Oluwa...you embrassed is Nigerians after all the talk.....nooo sis
“I like mine a little dry” Girl your ramen was more then a little dry 💀
When you are the weakest link and developed a sudden gluten allergy. 🥲
The first guy didn't make ramen, he made what my mom makes when she's feeling lazy lol
Who likes to eat cold noods? The noodles already absorbed the broth that makes the noodles so squishy and soft worst way to eat noods.
The ramen the cheetah girl made looked disgusting af
Lol the cheetah print girl hated everyone’s ramen and then everyone hated her ramen
Ice in  a bowl with water struggle os
gained a hell lot of confidence on my cooking skills after watching this. thanks.

Anytime I need to lose my appetite I come to watch this video
Me: wait I can add different seasoning in my ramen!!!!!?????
“The ramen has no color” Girl wants frikin colorful ramen instead of tasty ramen 💀
All they ramen look disgusting
Wasn’t Olu talkin the most smack but got the lowest score 🥹😭
Please stay with your Bananas and Cornmeal! Don't try Asian Food and disrespect other Cultures! We don't do that, then you Guys stop doing that! Buy the way? When is the next " Smashed and Grabbed" Event in your City?
Am I the only one just now finding this video in 2022

Asians watching this must be thinking of all the different bomb dishes they could make with ramen.
marcus looks like a lightskin tra rags
The afro girl knows she's lying. Like bruh, you already know that the other girls Ramen was better than each and everyone of theirs.
Where is the BROTH?
Wtf are they eating it with a 🥄
“It’s too watery” it’s supposed to be its ramen not just plain noodles PEOPLE
omg the one girl and the boys ramen was so dry it’s supposed to have broth
the cheetah girl acting like ramen is suppose to be a fancy food like girl its RAMEN!?!?!
That girl who lost seems like the one to thinks she can cook just cause she adds every spice under the sun to her food
business
I eat noodles with chopsticks 😎👌
Does anyone not know how to make ramen why is it so dry and no soup😭
I like my ramen A LITTLE dry. I put more noodles than I do broth. But what she did... Was really gross..
Indomei
Cheyenne the only one that had the closet to ramen with the soup, you gotta have that flavor to drink after eating it’s a must! Everyone else’s just looked dry
Why are they using spoons
Cheyenne a real one
i dunno but none of their ramen dishes looked good, probably didnt taste good either
Outside of the last girl these other two don’t even know how ramen works. Where’s the broth? The boiled egg? Like something of substance they must’ve been down treacherous cause those first recipes were not it bro
bro what am I watching here. Not one egg. Mushy as hell. What is this bruh
Mrs leopard shirt was lowkey annoying-
Imagine somebody came out with a spread lmaooo
Best way to cook noodles Cook for 4:30  Take out Mix the noodles Pour some water out but not all of it Add the packet Put hotsauce (as much as u want) Mix again Bone apple tit ☺️ Literally normal noodle but they be so gooooood 😩
bro the nigeria spice girl or smn but she was coming into this expecting raw, spicy, like spaghetti noodles to try bro
i felt like crying when i saw almost none of their ramen had broth up in it- LIKE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YALL
Olu full of ish
Why are they using a spoon????
cheetah print girl was talking hella shit but got the lowest score
It’s so annoying how they are like “it’s watery” “it has a bit of water” because it should! The guy and the dry ramen girl don’t know what real ramen taste like.
Other lady said it was mushy and cheetah lady said it was dry which is it
My ramen recipe : get the beef ramen noodle packet, put the noodles in a bowl, add water to the bowl, put in microwave for 4 mins, once done take it out of the microwave, drain the water, add the beef packet, mix, then add some seasoning salt, mix, and enjoy ! (let me know your rating !)
Hold up. The girl in the first one said it was too salty then that the only thing that had flavor was the chicken 😂like what
I love how Olu was like “THE RAMEN MATTERS” though she had chunks and blocks of ramen in her bowl 😐
SHE WON BUT THEY WERE GROSSED OUT BY HER FOOD, WHAT XD
I add soy sauce salt pepper garlic power onion powder chili powder its heavily seasoned but the soy sauce and broth makes it so flavorful
Watching this while eating ramen with a bowl full of BROTH- Why was the ramen so dry 😭
them: its watery us asians: its broth??? like authentic ramen?
As an Asian, I AM AWFULLY OFFENDED BY ALL OF THESE.. especially the second girl who boasted and her ramen was ass
You always fucking choose the dumbest, most unreal people there are.
Roman noodles is not a struggle food neither are pinto beans I love both and I could eat them all the time no matter how much food I have in house
I will never forget when I ate ramen in my friends room and I was horrified by the taste. I didn’t know people made it and ignored the boiling time.
Adding shrimp is cheating. That’s not cheap
I make ramen kind of soupy with hot sauce. Then I fry an 2 eggs and add them on top. Eggs are really cheap so college students can easily afford them
"The ramen is watery" AS IT FKN SHOULD BEEEEE. I am NOT eating dry ramen unless its in a stirfry or the way my dad makes it.  Marcus and Olu?? No thanks. My shit has to have liquid in it.
Why the Cheetah print girl was saying bad stuff about the others ramen when hers wasn't even cooked all the way🤦🏾‍♀️
Can of chili and Ramen, it's good
Garbanzo beans,canned chicken,cup o noodle, Chile oil.
So your telling me two things first people dont eat the ramen with the broth and this BROKE student eats ramen with FUCKING PRAWN prawn is expensive
……..I’m just disturbed…as the noodle queen, this is…….sinful
I love watching Americans struggle with simple things like instant ramen
Ramen with a spoon is crazy
That bitch came in there talking shit about others food and had the worst possible looking ramen I’ve ever seen. Hate her attitude and I’m glad her food was shit 😂
I’m a shook that people think dry ramen is normal 😭😭😭 I’ve always had “watery, slimy” noodles 🍜 I feel like they’re top notch lol.
miss cheetah was doing too much talking
Ok I'm a bit jail/ghetto with this must not be over cooked or too much water, turmeric, sugar,cayenne, garlic, soy sauce,pickle juice, smoked paprika and sesame oil add all ingredients in a bowl then add your noodles...I can eat it with meat or not... hey don't knock it....
Why are they treating ramen like pasta WHY IS IT DRY 😭😭😭Never watched idk naruto or any drama
cheeta bitch needa sit down
Cheetah girl talking off her mouth and hers is the worst
Why’s everyone calling the cheetah girl conceited and rude?? They all lowkey were
I’m so broke I don’t include additional ingredients, just gotta eat it as is
oluwamayowa was so salty and confident that she was gonna win
as a korean this video really hurts me to my core;;
Bro it’s supposed to have water
Its broth no water
do these people throw out the ramen broth?!?!?!
The only person who wasn't talking shit won
Explain why they dont use a fork or chopsticks and WHY ARE THEY MAD ABOUT THE BROTH?! THATS ONE OF THE MAIN PARTS OF RAMEN
i do beef ramen with chili powder and chili flakes, so good
“why is there water” ramen is soup 😭
In the last ramen isn’t it the soup not water?
I'm starting to feel like it's a joke bro LMAOO the cheetah print girl or whatever her name is- damn bruh
What kind of ramen are those 😂😂
The cheetah girl had bad karma
1 more broth= better  2 more spice= better
Do they live in a cave or something.. there is a dry ramen and there's a soupy ones bruh
bruh instant noodle could never
She cry over noodles 💀💀💀
Nahh bruh eastern european way is best way to eat ramen (okay well technically we have instant noodles but yeah. Rollton best instant noodle.)
This video makes me feel ashamed to be black.
Why... why is there no broth in two of them and the others were so confused to see broth... it's a soup XD
i dislike cheetah girl
IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE DRY? Like-
Color doesn’t equal flavor.
The girl with the cheetah print stuff 😂 is one of those “everything is about me” bougie girls that cant cook or bring nun to the table
Ramen noodle juices is the best part of eating Ramen!!!
Just a few things, ramen isn't good if its all in chunks and sticky, becomes basically tasteless, next the broth is a necessity, the more balanced the spices in the broth is the more you have a bonus to cherish after you finish the noodles. Add whatever you want to tho, but don't add to much spices in the noodles, the pack which is already with the noodles has it all, add some kind of othe food, like eggs or chicken sort of. Also add sauces, i love my ramen that way 😁😅
Last time i ever ate Ramen that crunched, my cousin and i were 12. We opened the pack, opened and put the season in the pack, crunched the Ramen some, and shook up the pack and ate it from there.  Update: I tried making the cheetah girls Ramen by making it myself, and the crunched pack my cousin and I made tasted better.
“This is just dry” girl have you even seen yours??
They all look bad to me 😂 and why are they complaining about Ramen having water? It's literally supposed to! unless you're eating Mi Goreng (or another dry noodle) which is honestly the one of the best instant anyway, dishonour on all
Doesn’t ramen have its own seasoning packet and instructions on it 😭 even if your broke you can still read and have the seasoning
ramen should have liquid whats wrong with those two
how are you a college student and you don’t know that ramen is supposed to come with broth
The cheetah print girl prefers her ramen so dry that she legit makes them into crumbs 👌💀
I was so excited to watch this like shiiiit find some new ways to eat ramen. Yeah that did not happen for me. Also I just knew that real cocky one was going to score the lowest lmfao!
I expect them to have spicyness so I was surprised  when the ramen wasn’t red- 🌶
Nigerians and their boastful talk you literally made concrete for ramen 🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣💀
Thought they were making pancit canton for a minute there lol.
They’re deff not broke lol
I'm glad they played afro chick because she was running that mouth
“Mine actually has flavor” not everybody likes to Season their Ramon with seasoning -Edit- the dude in the black shirt and girl in leopard literally had such dry noodles bruh
Bro raman is supposed to have actual broth what are these kids doing 💀
Theres a difference between ramen and spaghetti 😭
Am I the only one that only eats the ramen for the broth 💀
If they thought cheyenne's ramen was watery they wouldn't want to see mine🤣🤣🤣🌊🌊🌊
“the ramen is to watery” NO BECAUSE IM THE ONE MAKING THE RAMEN SOUP.
All that looks bad 😂 I could do so much better
“I don’t like all the water”  *You were never eating ramen in your whole entire life to begin with then.*
HAS NO COLOR BITCH ITS RAMEN
LOLLL THAT GIRL GOT HUMBLED QUICK
She rolling her eyes and shit. She gives me pick me vibes now Cheyenne I like a little better
🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗 it's cricketts in here🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗
Why are they so shocked to see ramen with a broth lmao no one wants dry ass ramen 😑
btc
Ramen has soup in it 😭😭
It’s salty are you tryna kill me… nah that’s called ramen it has lots of salt
just add water in it and cook...? 😭😭
"it has water in it, which is okay I guess" Water? oh that's broth best fran.
Yall eat with spoons🫢
“ a tsunami hit and this is what was like left on the streets” ☠️
Can’t handle the fact that 2/3 of them can’t handle soupy ramen… done right, the broth is the best part!! 😩😩
How can you even call this ramen, it's literally just dry noodles
Ass ass ass they were all ass all you gotta do is get half a packet of Chick-fil-A sauce and  then half a packet of Polynesian sauce then a tsp of hot sauce with some ripped up honey ham And then of course you’re ramen seasoning that shit is some restaurant shit im tellin u
Lmao I love how the guy gave the cheetah print girl 2 points just because it's edible 😭😂
Tf wrong with these people? Water? Bro it’s supposed to have water
cheetah print girl be acting like an ass to everyone yet shes the one with the lowest score
Marcus and the non humble lady: it’s just so watery it doesn’t seem to have anything on it  Me: HBSHSHBE ITS BROTH ITS NOT FRIED SO ITS BROTH RAMEN ITS NOT CHILI OIL RAMEN OR FRIED RAMEN IT AINT GONNA SHOW COLOR WHAT DO YA EXPECT….😫😩😫😩😩😩😫😩😩😫 (Marcus was  still nice after he tried it so he’s cool)
I haven’t even had real ramen but I’ve never not included the broth with instant ramen are they ok?😭
How do you fuck up ramen?
How do you afford shrimp?
Ok but is no one talking about them eating ramen with a spoon?!
Broke college kids complaining there isn't enough shrimp lol . Ramen is suppose to have broth lol wtf
Why are they eating the ramen with a spoon?😭
I understand that the Cheetah print girl was trying to show her culture in the ramen, but girl ramen is a south East Asian food…Can’t make it into a whole different food/consistency-
How y'all broke, picky and over confident 😂😂💀💀
Lol, y’all need me 😂
That Afro girl and that guy didn’t understand the assignment. They thought they were making pasta or something
If you have never been to Korea almost and prob ALL the ramen here includes water like who dosent add water
There ramens where so bad they ate it with spoons lmao 😂
let's face it, its black broke ramen
Cheetah print girl a npc
hearing them talk about ramen made me feel brain dead... water my guy? its broth and the broth is the main attraction in the first place likewhat????
Why is nobody acknowledging the spoons??!!
I’m honestly surprised none of them added an egg, boiled or fried to their ramen. It’s like the cheapest of the cheap kind of ramen with elevated flavor.
Bro, these youths complaining about the water when actual ramen requires it! No one even get me started on dry ramen😤. Spice balance is usually the biggest factor along with getting the texture right. If it comes out crunchy you undercooked it, if it’s slimy then you over cooked it. You’re supposed to drain it or cook it directly in the broth once it’s toothsome😩
Bro Olu was getting omn through out this entire vid like to me she was being so annoyingggg
Butter
Some people really dont know how to cook
Girl I'm Nigerian and that's the type or ramen that make Nigerian 10 year olds tell their parents they don't want ramen to school  Only toddlers take ramen like that to school but I get it broke college kids
ngl marcus do look like cordae
Not me making instant ramen while watching this
“ Broke college kids “ 😭
It’s the spoons for me🙄
This video is an Asian person's worst nightmare.
The loudest always have the lowest score...*My ramen is the best nye nye nye* An empty can for sure..Ramen should have broth unless you buy an dry ramen like Indomee, or korean spicy chicken noodles...The hair bigger than her brain I bet
using spoon? HAHAHAHA
The cheetah girl said her ramen actually had but we all no her heart has NO flavor for how rude she was
He was acting gay in annoying
I cooked better noodles first time i ever cooked and i can say that making better ramen. Than them wont be that hard
The first 2 were just stupid like wtf was that
Nigerian girl threw so much shadeeee
These people are really hating on the ramen broth- They will never survive at a ramen shop
‘Where’s the color’ oh I’m sorry did you want special green ramen made by the grinch💀
wtf broke gotta do with you not cooking Ramen right? it's so easy
The last girl the only one who knows what she doing
Nah these mfs lost eating ramen with a spoon and that ramen looks ass ngl
"its too watery" bitch ramen is meant to have broth
Ramen could have juice he make no sense like!?!
i love how that arrogant mf got a 0. also wtf do people not know ramen is like a soup bro
Leapord print couldn’t even say ramen right, no wonder she lost 💀
Moral of story we all like our Raman different, and stay humble.
I'm eating ramen as we speak
I don’t like a lot of water in my noodles either Idc what y’all say 😂😂😂
Did she say Rumen???
Me eating buldak ramen rn seeing the dry ramen cheetah lady gave 🙁
So why they using a spoon
Is it just me or do they all look nasty?
Yeaa.. Personally, I like Nissin Kimchi Bowl Noodle. Little bit of water, microwave until the soup is creamy, not soupy. Sooo good. And when financial aid grants come in, or if I have time to pick up an extra day of work, I'll buy a piece of salmon to go with it 🤑😂
What the fuck the other two be eating? Ramen is not pasta, there’s broth. If there’s not gonna be broth, the ramen better be looking nicely seasoned. I want to see color, not just cooked noodles. My broke Asian self is crying at the waste of ramen here.
is it just me who thinks there weird eating ramen with a spoun
Haha
This made me die a little on the inside
The best think is what are they eating ramen with A FVCKING SPOON 🥄
Dry ramen…noooo
all of the ramens look gross
THE NIGERIAN GIRL IS SUCH A FRICKING PICK ME I CANT 🤨😂
Good thing I learned my grandma’s recipe-
Chicken flavored ramen Wide bowl Whole ramen block inside Chicken seasoning on top Add water just enough to make the ramen float Microwave for 2 and a half minutes Flip every 30 seconds Take out Break up noodles Add topitio hot sauce until it's orange Add some crystal hot sauce Add some soy sauce 7 shakes of table salt Crushed red pepper Pink Himalayan salt Some bread to go with it A drink  Enjoy
Break up a bag of bbq chips and regular salt chips(or whichever flavor) put with the soup, you’ll be full
That one girl complained about it being salty then said that it needs more seasoning lol.
Y’all ramen look dry
mine is egg yolk on ramen as soon as the ramen is done, just stir it in the ramen will cook the egg to where you can eat it. it works best with soy sauce ramen or beef
tell olu to stay out of the kitchen ever ( im not joking )
mur rue chin
0:50 yeah food because they probably starved all through the day until like 8:53 To eat.😂
i don't understand broth-less romen. like i can't eat dry ass ramen bruh.
Im may not be a broke college student but i do love a ramen every other day
“Them saying it’s dry” LIke have y’all heard of ramen? Or seen it bro what.
all of these look horrible..
6:58 PLEASE STOP OLU ONG 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
I will never understand. Ramen is a noodle SOUP
What they had looked more like a yaki soba. It didn't look like ramen, I like putting spring onions and other things on it.
Crazy how they all black
Yeah... Ramen is supposed to be with water, unless it's stir fried... I mean, there's a variety on how you cook or make your Ramen... so I'm not gonna judge other people's preferences.
“I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” Yeah we can tell.☠️
It's crazy how the overly confident ones always have the worst food
She’s hyping up her spices so much not realizing that some things just don’t go together
Why are they eating the ramen with a spoon??
:]]
Hinni
Olu's tryna compare American ramen with Indomie, thats why it was so dry😭😭 Iykyk💀
That’s jail house top ramen y’all just add more meat and sausages then it will be spread!
literally shin ramyun alone beats all of them imo
Ramen is with soup
Im not even a college student and I guarantee my ramen would blow all 3 of them out of the water😂
this is instant noodles not 'ramen'
Where’s the fu**n soup 🍜???!
As a Nigerian, I’m disappointed
“I would give it more color” “it looks kinda dead” Girl do you want it rainbow with beautiful colors it’s ramen come one what do u expect
Oyster sauce…definitely know where the flavors at
I'm sorry, but all three of these are disgraceful attempts at ramen 😂😂😂. As an Asian person idk if I should be worried or offended. The last one was the closest and, even then, it just looked like ✨ soggy spaghetti ✨
It's as if two of them had never heard of broth
OK OK you'd never want my ramen, I load up all my ramen with hotsauce :)
WHY ARE THEY USING SPOONS TO EAT RAMEN????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can someone count how many times the cheetah print girl metioned atatagun (i don't know how write the spice)
Who tf eats noodles with a fucking spoon it’s a discrace and where is the soup
Cheetah girl: I'm pretty sure this is gonna win Marcus sees her ramen: this looks dry as hell 💀💀💀
These peoples ramen looks so dry…. Ew
Havent tasted them but i know They all suck😭
Why all they black thooo?????
they all suck at making ramen bru💀💀
WHERE IS THE BROOOOOTH?  and also these  idiots doing eat ramen with a SPOOOOOOOOON!?!?!?!?! i get it if you are using a soup spoon to eat the broth with the noodles but these clowns dont even have broth, how do they even begin to call those things ramen. They would be better off with instant cup noodles than that crap.
Why would you eat ramen if eggs are cheaper
The cheetah print girl was so rude BURH
as an asian i cringed throughout the whole video. have they never had real ramen its SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH NOT BE THAT WEIRD ASS CRUNCH BALL
No they don’t know how to make ramen except the girl with the ponytail
why are they all black?
Hahaha
cheeta print girl is who we all should avoid to be when we grow up LMAAOOO
All yourls ramen looks dry asf ….. mine is always watery watery with a beautiful red or brown broth 😍 when url say url broke but you put shrimp in your ramen 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. What the efff
I feel like herbs and cheese sauce would go with ramen noodles, that or I'm hungry for chicken alfredo
Seeing people eat ramen with a spoon makes me want to punch a can of Spaghetti-O's
The cheetah print girl is weird. “Give it some colour” excuse me?! It’s noodles! Colour isn’t  something one should consider! Also why is her ramen so dry- ramen should be like… I guess a soup of some sort.
She talking about color but she just said that she just about taste
The fuck do you mean "I dont like the water" mf have you ever seen real Ramen?
Shit yall don't I'll know true noodles I'll knock ya pants off
One question you do not season the ramen itself right? You season the broth and with the things around it like chicken etc
Lol the cheetah print woman doesn’t know how to cook at all lol she talks all that big shiyt but can’t even make a bowl of ramen lol smh
Cheetah girl down horrendous
Wea da Tonys at or swamp dust or some
Bruh.....  I'm not even asian and I know Ramen is a BLOODY SOUP FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!!!  These b*tches want yakisoba not Ramen 😂  Edit: amazes me on re-watch all these "college educated " people are so unaware that ramen is a broth based meal
the girl w the ponytail was so respectful unlike the one w the cheetah print.. 😭
When real ramen has water in it 😭 THE SOUP
It's too salty??? But then says it has no flavor. Sis you just talking😂😂goodbye
“I will like her ramen a little bit more dry” HAHAH GIRL UR RAMEN WAS DRY AF T T it look undercooked
Cheetah print kept talking about colors and spices even tho hers was clumps and dry, and the guy who doesn’t like water in his *ramen* (soup) lost me when he said the ramen look like something you see on the sidewalk because it had water and wasn’t dry.
The girl with the afro is annoying  "The chicken is nice but it's a side item" WHO CARES
why it look dry
The cheetah print girl said Marcus ramen was salty then she said it had no taste ???
Have they never ate ramen or smt?!? They don’t like the water….ramen comes with broth 😭😭😭
Do people not know ramen has water in it?…..
Ik she did not just say the ramen is dry then pull out uncooked ramen u idiot 💀
Who eats dry Ramen? The first two looked nasty. As soon as I saw the 3rd I was like, there's our winner. A little broth plus her flavor profile she gave. It knew it was a winner.
Who tf eats the ramen with no broth my guy lmao my ramen would blow them out the water
bro who tf eats ramen with spoon🤡💀💀
God I wanna drop kick that bitch in the cheetah print. She's so self centered and was so confident hers was the best. "The shrimp saved the day!" Stupid ass, just enjoy the ramen and not try to make ur self look like a stuck up bitch
Where’s the soup nun if them can make ramen 😂😂😂
Who eats ramen with a SPOON 🥄?!  Use a fork 🍴 or chopsticks 🥢
First 2  look dry as hell I would rather starve
I’m Nigerian two
to be fair...every sing one of these was missing hot sauce. -1 outta 10 do not reccomend
Can I come on the show I would have won lol 😂
Why are they eating Ramen with spoon when there is no broth in most of them half of these are just flavored noodles not Ramen
Like how u make noodles taste good is sauce that's all
I ain't never heard anyone say they season their noodles for ramen.......ramen noodles are just flour and water boiled in some more water
The cheeta girl is huge pick me
no diss but ramen has broth/soup in it, it is NOT supposed to be dry. IT CAN BE BUT THAN ITS NOT RAMENNN lmaoo dem noodles supposed to moist and flavored and not yk... what the other two made XD im sorry for Olu cause she tried a different approach but naaw girl
None of them had broth they all fail lol
Cheeta print girl a whole clown💀
That black girl are so fucking picky
Complains about no color 👍🤡 what a fucking clown
“It’s actually pretty good” Minutes later… “I rate it a 3”
Y they eating it with a spoon
Ngl all of their ramen looks so sad 🤣🤣 but hey, they tried their best with their budget
Try making Ramen How I make it  Instructions: https://photos.app.goo.gl/MxpeRc8af7JSqLRU7 Clear Finished Product: https://photos.app.goo.gl/CoBircriyMF4xTJo7

The girl that got the worst ratings was trying to act like she knows how to cook ramen😆😭
I love it the girl from Africa thought she had the best but that she got the worst rating lmao
Y’all not eating ramen as soup????
None of their ramen look any good tbh. I always put a few jammy eggs in there as well as pork belly, enoki mushrooms, green onions, siracha, sesame oil, oyster sauce maybe a little kewpie mayo for creaminess. And BROTH. Lol why were they upset there was broth? The way these guys were talking I thought they actually going to put effort in.
Wait... Do these people not know what real ramen is like? One of them said that they like their ramen DRY. Like, ramen comes with a broth? I don't know, that just seems crazy to me that they think is just like the instantnoodles they buy.
I thought how to prepare decent ramen was ubiquitous amongst everyone, but these mofos seem like they never had instant ramen in their lives !!! 🤣
People???? Eat it without????? broth?????????
“Too much water” if you don’t have water in it you have never even had actual ramen. 💀
…idk what’s so hard about making basic ramen which takes like 5 minutes 👁👄👁 if they were broke children I’d understand but aren’t they supposed to be college students 💀 it can’t be that hard to follow a 3 step instruction…not to mention I made ramen myself when I was a literal child and it looked better than whatever all those weird mutations were💀💀💀
i put eggs and siacha mayo, and green olives and HOLY SHJT  YALL ITS SO GOOD
Shout out to the shrimps that saved the day! 🤣
I put Parmesan cheese after I drained the noodles in my spicy Korean noodles (badduk)with eggs 😋
i dont understand why only one person uses broth???
"To watery" wtf do you meaaaan there's not enough water in it to make the broth. "Ramen" they say nigga that's noodles 😑make me angry af up in here
i’m sorry all three ramens look crusty 😭😭😭
The one wi the cheetah shirt is so annoying-
MAYOWA, I was fine with the crayfish but who tf uses atagugun to make noodles? Even in Nigeria, we just pour our seasoning packets and rest... Why would you put atagugun? That still blows my mind
Bro the other two are just eating dry noodles
not y'all going off on cheetah print girl
Cheetah and man need to be humbled omg theres both looked gross
honestly ramen and instant ramen are completly different foods
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TOO WATERY? THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD REAL RAMEN! IT COMES WITH BROTH!
That shit is gross af! 🤢🤢 they have no idea how to make good ramen for cheap. This is just sad.
On behalf of all Nigerians, please please please and please, Olumayowa's(cheetah print girl)  ramen is not and would never be of Nigerian style. Thank you!
My ramen would kill all of theirs.
They was all trash lol
Bruh throw an Asian kid in there
They gave them spoons 😭😭😭
Ramen has a broth, and Noodle don't have to , fried noodle it doesn't taste bad tho 😌
DID THEY JUST USED SPOONS FOR RAMEN SEND THEM TO THE GOOLOG
My favorite cheap ramen meal before egg prices skyrocketed was ramen with scrambled egg, and a good amount of Tapatio sauce
This is definitely not how Nigerians make their Roman... Oh na! This is a huge embarrassment.
With that attitude I knew they wouldn't like hers, and only hers...
How you come on here disrespectful, and can’t even cook ramen lol.
"it has water" EXCUSE YOU IT'S SOUP
If ramen is all I had, the broth would be essential. If I had no tea, broth took care of it. If I had no protein, one boiled egg and that's it. If I feel crazy and my crackers are going stale, take a bite and sup a FORK..
Lol. This was funny to watch. No competition
That's ramen?? Where z broth? Z soup? Out ere in Jamaica we add seasoning. Some ppl eat it with tough crackers. Other add boiled eggs. We don't even wait til e cool or z noodles just suck it up
Disgraceful!
why r they eating it dry wth
Me wondering why there all black
Bro their ramen is so dry. It's ramen, it's meant to have broth or liquid of some sort. If they want dry them it's usually Yakisoba
I put eggs in my ramen is that bad😀
i wudda embarrassed all of em since nobody else sayin it
😭 nauh I’ve been broke broke and never have I raw dogged ramen like that like it’s straight out the package with dry seasoning. Where’s the broth …the different textures?
Bro the one with the ponytail was the only normal person there 💀
Wateryyy???? 😭😭 Do you mean broth 💀
What is wrong with these people, ramen is served with broth why is it dry 💀???
I’m sorry but apparently some of these people doesn’t know how most ramen is IT HAS SOUP and also it was hilarious to see the person boasting about their ramen do terribly  Edit: 2 weeks later I’m here eating ramen and honestly I would’ve put an egg and either fish tofu or Taiwanese sausage
Weres the the broth
Last girl only one who made ramen look like ramen
God bless stay safe God loves y’all all I hope everyone has a blessed day ✝️🙏
These are wack af, all you need is a good hot sauce (not sriracha) and throw in some lemon.  If you really want to get crazy throw in some spicy pork skins. 🔥
“my mom is Spanish” girl what 😭😭
“I’d prefer my ramen a bit more dry” yeah we saw💀
These are not Ramen recipes...they are noodle recipes. Ramen is served in a broth, there is no such thing as dry Ramen
Cheyenne's is the best
Ramen is supposed to have a broth
Being broke at any age above 17 is wack....try paying for a rent, and a car to get to work, and water and heating bills, and being broke at the same time. being a college student is easy lol
Man you can tell that none of these students have ever even seen authentic ramen 😂😂
my ramen is the best fr
I don't know why eating ramen has been dubbed a broke thing. I just love ramen, and in the u.k its not the cheapest thing either.
why do i feel like people are faking it on this channel just for views??? like im sure at least some people know how to cook
“nasty, too much water, bland”    literally 2 seconds later:     “ok, it’s actually pretty good..” *goes for seconds*
why they complaining about “water” in ramen.. lololol atleast they liked it doe
best way to make ur ramen. cook the ramen with boiling water get a pan and put in garlic, butter, AND olive oil. let the garlic brown a bit put in rosemary then ur flavor packet then when the noodles are cooks put them in the pan mix and it is SO AMAZING
When the girl in the cheetah print started listing her ingredients, I started thinking she missed the whole point of the contest in which the objective was to make a bowl of ramen with limited resources.
Who likes dry ass ramen🤮🤣
the girl with the cheetah print is goofy asf
“ I prefer my ramen dry”  Oh girl we know
Shout out to ol’ boys teeth ! he sheered every single noodle in one bite no slurp .HOW ! ?!?!?
this makes me so insanely angry
I like ramen as soup. Coconut milk, finely cut meat (sausages or shrimp for me)., finely cut potatoes, cut vegatables and lots ginger, the season pack, my seasoning and a bit of sugar and rum. Ramen without the soup is just pasta. Or the simpler regular version ramen with eggs, sausages, shrimp, cut vegatables and pepper all boiled up with that ramen. Like come on where's the water. Yes you got to eat the ramen quickly so it doesn't get soggy then drink the broth next. Without broth it's just, makes you feel empty
lmao the most confident and boastful person lost by a mile lmaoooooo hope she watches this
Cheetah girl is so full of it 💀
Why are they eating ‘Ramen’ with a spoon?
I immediately hated the girl with big hair. Like she's just rude and overconfident
God the Leopard print girl was so annoying. I hated how overly confident she was in her cooking and how she used it to belittle other contestant’s, who ended up not even liking it
Me noodles ho hard💯🤙🏿 delicious
Do they not know what ramen is? It has broth.
Im not sure why broke ass college kids are eating barely constituted ramen, and calling it cooked.  Like maybe sometimes you eat that dry as a snack, but when you cook it, its dupposed to have broth- and thats half of why its so filling for so cheap! Theyre missing half the meal....but whatever  They make me so mad, i gotta go make a bowl of ramen
Damn olu was so damn rude
oh i know olu is not talking- nah with her diggely dangely dry as sahara clump noodles that literally look like shat 💀
Ramen comes with broth it’s not always dry
None of their ramen looked good only good thing was the girls with the shrimp maybe.
I thought ramen wasn’t supposed to be dry n it’s supposed to be have the soup in it ??
NOW GWORL, ms cheetah print, pack it up NOWWWW!! aint no way u so confident and no one likes it
“just to make sure im not eating anything BAD y’know😀” girl It’s ramen
I would've loved to see their reaction to the rating like yes cocky girl your ramen is the worst
There’s fucking instructions on the package tf they doing
People judging soupy ramen lol 🐸
How do you screw up ramen noodles??
As an Asian… idk if I should be offended while looking at their ramen… CAUSE FIRST OF ALL WHERE THE FREAKIN BROTH? At least one of them put broth💀 Cheyenne had a good recipe AND broth. Girly deserves the win. ALSO WHY THEY EATING WITH A SPOON!?  Ok but if this how Americans are with ramen then do they really deserve the beauty of it? ITS SO MUCH BETTER TO JUST MAKE THE PACKET! NO NEED TO MAKE IT FANCY PEOPLE (And I might sound passive aggressive but I swear I’m not👀)
“I prefer my ramen a bit dry”  *Yeah couldn’t have guessed that…*
Who allowed that dumb girl to participate? Too watery? Do you know what ramen is you nitwit? Talking the most and your ramen looked like embarrassment. No. Leave. You need forgiveness
This is dumb adding anything else makes it seem like it’s defeats the purpose of being cheap dude said he wanted more shrimps like WTF
Spoons with ramen and they don’t really know how to cook 🤦🏾‍♀️
the girl with the cheetah print its just rude tbh
This whole video has to be a joke, right?
the Nigerian girl with the fro got on my nerves
That cheetah printed top girl is a literal bitch ngl
Why d9 people think she jas cheetah pront it a JAGUAR
How her noodles look dryer than my dms
These poor broke babies!!!!!!!😁🤣🍜
5:12 " I threw some shrimp in here"  Me: am I blind cause I only saw 1 shrimp
I want then to the reaction to the score
Wait until they discover dumplings
And yet they all ate ramen with a spoon....
every asian is screaming watching this video
Moral of the story don't be cheetah print girl
why is there no broth
She just said she like it dry u needa go eat some damn rice den wth 😂 these people be disrespecting ramen lmao
The ramen I’m seeing here tho 💀💀💀
I just cringed pretty much every time the girl in the cheetah print said anything tbh
Being broke doesn't mean you can't present your ramen better 😭
Who even eats clumpy ramen bc that's not even ramen anymore 💀💀
Cheetah print girl made me mad
I don’t think Cheyenne understands that Spanish means from Spain 🇪🇸 😂😂😂
Jesus Christ, do they not eat ramen!?  You get most of the flavor through the broth…..smh.
Oluyama: the ramen is a bit watery. Me: no shit it’s in water dumbass
The cheetah girl: it’s kinda doesn’t have any color” Her ramen: ⬜️⬜️⬜️
Olu is a clown. CLOWN 🤡
cook and egg in it and add lemon juice and tapatio 😋
they all look nasty lol
The Nigerian girl gives off big hater energy
She’s a hater
What the fuck were those ramens.
Not to start anything but why are all the "BROKE KIDS" BLACK???
No hate but how can u study somewhere while not being able to cook proper ramen?
as an east asian high school student whos go to afterschool meal is ramen, i would absolutely obliterate these people if i was brought onto this show
Bruh these r not even real ramen 💀
Olu was talkin so much smack, karma smacked her into reality
The amount of likes this gets is how much of us just love Raman noodles! 👇
do people eat dry ramen?
I stumble upon this video once again and I still cant get over the fact they called the broth water like bruh
Beef flavored ramen put it in a pot just enough water to make it float add like 3 splashes of fish sauce and the beef packet some hosen sauce a little bit of ginger some Sriracha and a splash of soy sauce and you be ight it's a bit on the sweeter and spicy but you can add to taste
This girl was talk down on they noodles like girl and your noodles wasn’t even good out of all of themmm  😂😂
How did the Jamaican girl say the first one was salty then she said it didn’t have flavor🙄
I thought that was lil bit from us outsiders😭
Really complain about the soup in the ramen they kinda slow huh 🤔
Why do they have spoons??? And none of em
you dont....have broth with your ramen...??
Who are these people!!? Ramen has soup/ broth. Who the hell eats dried ramen.
Shrimp and chicken? They don't know broke.
Y’all know ramen supposed to have broth right? 🤡
WHERE IS THE BROTH
why they complaining bout the ramen having water…
My mans said- “It’s like a bowl of bread crumbs” I’m sorry what?!q😂💀
i'm going to win  This shit dry as hell 🤣😂
ke7la ti soukti al 3eziya ata gugun oula zebbi
In college we used to mix beef and tomato flavor ramen in our coffee machine. You couldn’t tell us that wasn’t spaghetti 🍝 and meat sauce. It was delicious 😂😂😂😂😂 I cant find tomato flavor ramen anymore otherwise I would still be smashing!
I think it would be Hella funny if we got to see the others reactions to the score
Olu gave us crunchy ramen. Girl 😭
The  overconfident one in cheetah spots got humbled real bad-
As an Asian, if I made Olu and Marcus’s dishes. I would get whooped my way onto the streets 🥲
Raemen???? IT'S PRONOUNCED RAHMEN 🤦‍♂️
These people aren't broke enough for me. If you're really broke you won't drain the broth. The broth would fill your stomach alongside the noodles - and if you're big poor you need that.
i hate people who do dry ramen 😭 it literally says ramen noodle soup on the fucking pack its soup not pasta
ramen without the water isnt ramen
ramen is supposed to have broth meat seaweed egg pork much more but i get they are uni students but like you cant mess up noodles that bad
I swap ramen for a pack of udon noodles, cook down a little sweet onion & add a can of progresso French onion soup. Cost like $4. You get two big servings. If you want, buy a cheap $7-8 dollar chuck steak n slice that down thin cook it off with the onion. Its banger
All this ramen is mid compared to just plain samyang or shin LMAO these Americans just eat basic maruchan bc they're all uncultured
Those two contestants are like dry S hell bro wtf I can she it in their eyes cuz their eyes are dry s hail too like wtf raman's point is water bruh wtf.    Edit: I forgot their name the dry dude is Marcus and dry female is Oluakmwjwahhagegagannamakaajhsgsmka
Ramen is not supposed to be eaten dry!!! Wtf!!! Americans ruin everything😂😂
Im white and have more culture than all of them combined lol
Not the noodles look dead 😂😂
So glad Olu didn't win and the other guy because pride is not the way shout out to Chy!!!!
Damn they make my ramen look lik a fucking masterpiece
Ramen 🍜 Is A Soup technically u need BROTH 😂😂
god should make people go through this instead of hell cause this is well worse
wtf? the last one is the best and normal ramen should be!!
Wtf, isn't ramen supposed to have soup?
salty then no flavor? 😂
the look on cheetah prints face when she tries the last ramen she knew she lost
😂💀 imagine giving these people a jail house spread💀🤣
The girl withcthe cheetah print only gave that girl a 3 cuz she wanted to win thinkin they gave her like a 9mpr ten but no

Still no broth
Why in the fuck does their ramen have no broth? Where’s the broth?! I didn’t even know people make this without broth

Can you be picky when you’re broke in college?

"We have Rawmahn, to save the day"
JESUS/GOD LOVESS YOUU ALL REPENT HES COMINGG AMENN!! 🙏💗💗

ITS SOME PEOPLE REALLY OUT HERE WHO DONT KNOW HOW TOO COOK NOODLES DAMN 🤣😂😂🤣🤣
The ramen is supposed to be salty lol
I love how she gave him a 2 out of spite and he gave her a 2 out of pity 😭
bro the second one got violated
The fuck is this? How is that even called a "ramen"?
That ain't ramen. That's Cupanoodles 😂
I love the Black Garlic Oil kind, which has the soup base packet, I use  either chicken or shrimp as the protein, with sesame oil or fish oil or both sometimes. And multiple seasonings like cayenne pepper, sometimes I like lemon pepper and chili oil...there are so many ways lol
"Why is it so watery?" The definition of ramen: a noodle SOUP
Cheetah print girl=brutal critic Same cheetah print girl=got the most brutal criticism. Poetic justice🤣🤣🤣
“Its too salty”, 2 seconds later it needs seasoning???? What…?
A dry ramen is a sad ramen
Doesn't ramen mean like noodles and vegetables in a nice broth- 💀🤚 and they r like 'I dOnT LikE WaTeR In My RaMen'
no broth... what..??
The nerdy looking nigga is uncultured asf
bro the African girl is trippin the whole time like how that disrepectful over ramen my ni99a like fr then you giving tip like you a ramen expert and your end up being trash like she basically pissed me off lol
Whats the difference of boilded Ramen then microwaved ramen? I boilded Ramen before and it tasted bad like microwaved
Since when tf we stop adding water to our ramen the name is literally ramen noodle SOUP these people are despicable and nasty except for that one girl
The people who enjoy Raman without broth have no souls…
Okay.. who eats ramen with a spoon, and people seriously eat ramen dry? That sounds absolutely terrible. It's soup.. like, you just cook the noodle and eat that?
“This sh*t look dry as hell” lmao, that’s awesome
I don’t like the girl with the leopard pattern Like no one cares stop being so self centered and your shit ain’t Fire bro…
“i’m gonna smell this just to make sure it’s not bad” girl u can’t tell if something taste good just by the smell😂
omg the girl w the poka dot shirt is a QUEEN “my mama told me if i don’t have anything to say don’t say anything at all” that other girl should take her advice 😂
that girl has a pretty long name tho
"Its salty" "Wheres the flavor?" SO WHICH ONE WAS IT?
Bruh all I do is add two eggs and cheese and pull my noodles between the eggs so it gives it a creamy light orange look and texture
The mistake was no asians.
The curly hair girl hates the boys Ramen but the other girl loves the boys Ramen and the boy and the other girl hates the curly hair girls ramen
Imagine if uncle roger watch this
I’m crying at how dry the ramen is 😭😭😭😭
All of their ramen looks dry tbh lol
that cheetah print girl: ITS SO SALTY YOU TRYING TO KILL ME? also cheetah print girl: Season the ramen
Some ppl really don’t know how to make ramen Even a 5 year old could make better ramen
Ramen without water is just noodles
Ramen is noodles and broth. Whole reason for the broth packet
Peanut butter, egg and ginger powder nuff said. Bonus points with fish sauce and Sriracha
Do these people not know that uh ramen has broth…?
Bro the girl in the cheetah print is like so self centered 🙄 Like she out here tryna give tips like have you tasted urs Cheyennes ramen look good 🫣🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🤤
I TELLING YOU IT IS ALWAYS THE MOST RUDE PEOPLE WIT THE WORST FOOD!!!!!!!
She played in an outfit can pick my date
Different Vibe and Different Taste bruh 💀
That guy and the cheetah girl was so rude
Yall could add spam and eggs with yall ramen and its solve.
What’s wrong with them like it’s ramen THIS IS RIDICULOUS
It's salty ..... but needed seasoning?!!!? I'm confused lmaooo
Do y’all not realize woman is supposed to have broth
The cheetah girl called it raw-men yeah I think that’s how she thinks it’s supposed to be
These kids have no idea what good food is lol
Ramen is supposed to have sauce/broth in the bowl!!  If you can eat it with a spoon most likely it is not done.  I use half of the season packet and will add garlic, black pepper, rotisserie chicken, vegetables like a broccoli, cauliflower and carrots mix to start.  I'll even put sausage in it.  Oh, and as I learned in South Korea, an egg.  There's more than just one way to eat it.  And where was the kimchi?
Yo I was a broke college kid who legit lived on 2 packs of ramen a day these mfrs putting shrimp and chicken on it?!? lol I was lucky to have and egg and Sriracha to add this is some high class ramen 😂
Rude don’t just call people broke there not
wait you guys don't like your noodles with the soup/water?
its fkn top ramen why is cheetah print acting like this is masterchef
White people don’t know how to season their food! Proceeds to pour chicken broth flavor down drain.
Why everybody's ramen looks dry af I need mines with broth at least smfh nah
I don’t think any of these people know how ramen should be served.
Her I like my ramen a little dry: everyone we can tell lol
Why ya using spoons doe????
Cheetah girl: calls marcus' ramen dry (bland) Also Cheetah girl: Dry ramen ball
Her: "I like my ramen a bit more dry"  Her ramen: Literally a rock
3rd girl is the way normal people eat their damn ramen
Mmm I feel this Veterinary Technician Student! And raising a 4 year old ummm has. Broke to the ass to the college student!
WHY ARE THEY USING SPOONS
“Its a bit watery“ gurl ramen is supposed to be a soup 🥲🥲

how u eat ramen with a spoon??
Just . Use . The . Damn . Seasoning . Packet . A bujon cube . And the damn Siracha
Why she say ramen like that bruh
No way all three look 🤮🤮🤮
Am I they only one who still have broth in they noodles ?? lol like the girl who one won noodles are how mine our with some extra stuff
I dont understand why people add salt to ramen when its salty already, I add siracha, maybe some mixed veg and a egg
cheyenne best contestant bro
Cheetah girl: Mine is going to win it has a different taste a different vibe Other contestants: all give her a one
All of these looked sad asf like damn bruh just buy good ramen and follow the packet directions and you'll get better results. Than whatever tf that is
As a broke college student, this is disgraceful🤢
Can we all agree. What they r eating is not ramen. Want ramen. Go to Japan brooo.
Olu and Marcus overreacting is everything
Not to be rude but all of em were kinda being a picky eater for a broke college student's meal
The fact that the Afro girl and the guy hate each others ramen-
i dont even like shrimp bro but it's got broth and seasoning you KNOW that's the best one
I’m Asian and I’m here questioning why the ramen dry asf like bro where the flavor where’s that broth that flavor you cooked it in :/
People eat ramen with spoons?!?! D:
They clearly don’t know what actual ramen looks or tastes like lol
They need to try my secret neoguro fried ramen with secret sauce
The guy eating the ramen was soo rude like “I don’t wanna eat it” it’s rude I would’ve just ate it and rated like was that really necessary?
Ok I feel like I need to say this..WHO TF EATS RAMEN WITH A SPOON
My question is where the f*ck are they're broth at, they say they broke but they don't add the broth. They wasting they're goddamn money 😑
I'm the type of guy who likes ramen with mayo and cheese  (Fucking delicious btw) it was a "viable" option and I mean hey it works
Cheetah Girl: Says Marcus’s ramen is salty Cheetah Girl: Proceeds to tell him to season the ramen and saying it has no flavor.
How do they not like the water? Like have they seen a real ramen bowl like ever? Lmao
"I don't like all the water " It's called broth.
Y’all suck at making ramen. Even if its instant ramen.
its salty, are you trynna kill me??? *what.. what the fu--*
As a broke Asian/Polynesian at 20…wtf is up with these “ramen recipes”. Did none of these people heart of egg, kimchi, green onions, ham, sprouts, or even spam like come onnnnnnn😅 also eating dry no broth OVER COOKED noodles. I…I can’t.😅
All of those ramen looked terrible
Ik im not the only one who thought all there noodles are trash 💀
Last girl made gumbo
Everybody dissin Olu but her biggest mistake really was trying to serve nigerian spices to americans
“Shut down the studios” 😅
Who is eating their ramen 🍜 dry though??? It’s wrong on so many levels! 😂
Why the spoons tho?
olu is annoying asf
season the ramen😳 the ramen matters🙄
Why are people so used to dry Ramen? 😕 Ramen is known for its broth, noodles, and toppings..... not dryness.
“maroochin” 😭
With water =  ramen  Without water = noodles
Where’s the broth??? I thought they were barely gonna add the water😂
Cheeta print girl cocky asf and still LOST
"The ramen a little wet" it is literally called ramen noodle soup soup is wet
wtf?
How do people not know that ramen comes with regular broth?
I knew loud mouth was gonna lose. Main one talking and she was purposely giving low scores in hopes of winning. Out here making "seasoned brick bites". #GoSitDownSomewhere
I’m sorry but none of these were creative in any shape or form
I used to empty out the broth now I don’t in the rare occasion I eat packaged ramen because it tastes better with more broth
they all lost ...
Omg. They don't know its the broth and simple is better
Bruh do they not know what ramen is??? Where’s the broth??? Only one of them had broth and the rest were talking about some “there’s water in it”. Like what?
Ramen is supposed to have water🧍‍♀️
Cheetah prints ramen looks like it’s a artifact from 1589
<3
Nigeria. My country. FOR. LIFE.
I used to buy a cheese spread with the pourable spout and nuke ramen noddles and drain them and then add the liquid cheese and have cheesy noodles. They were GOOD.  Btw, how broke are these College students to have chicken and shrimp??  We had $1 meats when I was in school (A long time ago). These were questionable uncooked meats that cost a $1. It was sometimes just a chicken leg. Sometimes 2 pieces of chicken. That's how we survived.
Bruh it’s not water it’s broth, I’m Japanese and we put a lot of broth in ours
How u gon be broke and this picky, like cmon
I like my ramen without the soup cause last time I had it with the soup I remember throwing it up I mean mainly cause I was sick but that scared me a bit
Dudes that one character from coralline
I’m so sorry but “my moms spanish”
you’re literally supposed to make it with water?! are these ppl stupid
I’m sorry Miss Cheetah but your noodles doesn’t deserve the “Nigerian Styled” title. I know people younger than you that don’t make blocks. Tip: If it is “Grey and Dry” then add more water, oil and some tomato paste. Your welcome.
Omg stop, everybody in this video is dumb af. It’s just fking ramen!
The girl with the cheetah print was doing the most that’s why her ramen was ass. It makes no sense how she said that the guys Ramen is SALTY then she started saying that it has NO FLAVOR  that makes no sense. Then she started talking about her ramen girl bye.
I prefer my ramen with chicken and eggs and some sauce
do they not realize that ramen literally has broth
wtf is this  none of these are ramen acceptable the disrespect to ramen to the 3 of them
Watery Ramen. Is suppose to be served in a soup. I'm so livid
*”i like my ramen a lil dry..”*  don’t worry girl, we know you do.
respectfully, the ramen looks extremely....not great coming from an asian person 💀
*I feel as if Contestant* #2 *was simply a decoy.*
No egg and no soup!!??
Bro why's her. Name so long
I know ramen with broth is amazing but check this out.  1) Use Shin Ramyun (if you're okay with spice) and put the flavor packs in a bowl, also add minced garlic and some chopped green onions to the bowl. 2) While you cook the noodles in water also heat up a bit of vegetable or peanut oil in small pan. 3) Once noodles are soft and oil is fairly hot, pour the oil into the bowl that has your spices and mix it all together. 4) Once soft, put noodles only in the bowl (add a splash of the hot water) and mix it well so the spices get all over the noodles.   I started doing this after eating basic top ramen with the water and I honestly get so much more flavor out of the ramen this way. If you try it let me know what you think! ( I also add cayene powder, ginger powder, and smoked paprika to my spices along with a hardboiled egg to top it, but add or don't add whatever you like! Also pro tip: add a bit of soy sauce to the water cooking the noodles.)
That one girl thinks she got the best one lol
Gross
Not enough shrimp?? Y'all are broke, shrimp is a luxury sir haha
Why is the ramen in short chunks? Aren't they supposed to be long noodles? 0.0
who pissed in the cheetah girl's ramen?
If these guys want to eat brothless ramen they should just eat mie goreng
“Needs more shrimp” this is broke collage student food
BLACK
Why are they eating the ramen with a spoon?
hot sauce and tuna ftw
Is it me or they are Literally eating Ramen with a SPOON??!!
I’m sorry I’m only 2 mins in and they’re serving ramen with a spoon… where’s the fork, or chopstick?😭😭😭
Olu thought she gon win and she got the worst rating😂🔫 thank god tho
Always the ones to be gassing their food up to be the worst xDDD
Bro ramen needs fucken broth how you gonna say to much water
Ulo still got a two and she still talking trash… can we talk about that  name - 𝓗𝓸𝓼𝓱𝓲𝓻𝓸
all of these look really bad
Is it just me or does none of them look good
Ramen 🍜 should have a lil water... Lol who likes dry noodles n tip when u empty all The water it makes the noodles hard when cold n lumps together.
the way the cheetah print girl said that the guys ramen was “just dry” but hers literally comes out with dried up clumps in it… 🤨🤨 a bit ironic and mostly embarrassing
STAY HUMBLE and don’t big yourself up too much otherwise us people get second hand embarrassment
Egg Are the u-sving spoons
Broke student and eating chicken and shrimp.  People are confusing broke with poor handling of money.
why they eating it with a spoon bro 😭
what they cooked arent event considered ramEn. eugh disrespect to asian
Lmao none of them liked the cheetahs ramen deserve.
Sit down 🪑 be humble 😅😂
Oh hell nah!!! How're you gonna use pack ramen with no soup, the texture just goes way off if you put the seasoning after straining all the water and not adding oil or butter at least, it needs moisture!!! What the cheetah print girl did was a crime. I like stir fry style too but that clearly ain't it, no oil or butter touched that bowl, it looked like ramen that was taken out of the strainer and put into the fridge for a day with how it was clumped and dry. Imma stop here before I turn into more of the ramen police.
girl with the braids annoying asl
I don't know about these guys, but likee I don't like dry ramen, I like my ramen with like the broth 🤷🏽‍♀️, if it's dry it has like zero flavor
Ramen is called ramen for a reason. She likes snacks
I love that the girl who was the most confident actually sucked
are these regular noodles? like the ones be in jewels cause if so they all cooked disgusting
Attegoon is now all I think about thanks to cheetah print girl
Bro it’s not water it’s broth what the fuck
6:17  bro...in a few years I swear people gonna complain about chicken in their chicken wings
Why are they confused by a soup having broth? I don't understand at all.
I can shit out instant ramen that looks better than this shit. What the hell happened here
None of these guys know how to make ramen except for the broth girl
watery ramen😭 what
Next, you guys need to do “Soccer Moms Try Each Other’s Halftime Snacks” 💀
Nahhh cheetah print said the first one was too salty then said it didn’t have flavor? Girl what
this oluwamayowa is pissing me off.
I don't get how she could say "it's salty" but then say only the chicken has taste
Olu wants to talking about “ ThIs HaS nO tAsTe, nO sEaSoNiNg” she’s the one that has the least rating 😭
YOO WHERE THE VEGGIESS OMGAA
Lol I'm struggling but I'm glad I'm not too broke to make real meals. I couldn't survive on ramen😂
“It looks grey” like hers was any more colourful 👁👅👁
Cheetah print girl hating to win smh
Sheesh, them some dry ass ramen. But I've definitely been there during my freshmen year(dropped out). They said freshmen 15, but I lost 10lbs lol. I definitely didn't have seasons and shit. I left the water in there to keep me full. 2 packs a day.
. . . guys it's FUCKING INSTANT RAMEN
“Shoutout to the shrimps that saved the day”😂😂
why they eating noodles with a spoon…
That Cheetah Girl was so rude... But hella cute at the same time tho 😍
my ppl how can you mess up ramen.Thats says alot about the cooking skills
Lol the guy and cheetah girl had the nerve to judge someone's ramen based on looks? Their sh!t looked super dry and left nothing to the imagination.
marcus!!! lmao
like literally my Raman is good than eat one of those and Raman fucking includes water in it and Raman is watery!!!.
I love how the cheetah girl was bragging and flexing her ramen and everyone hated it
Olu definitely a spoiled child
Thought thumbnail was V from shameless
why would they call it ramen when it doesn't even have broth 😐 it's literally just noodles with seasoning(s) this is RAMEN ->🍜
funny how this is their "broke college student" ramen but there's shrimp in it, like maybe it's different there but in my country shrimp is expensive food
imagine eating ramen with spoon :')
3:11 that look💀💀💀💀😭😭😭
Tbh Cheyenne is such a sweetheart she was trying to be nice and also her Ramen is the most accurate to Korean, chinese, japanese ramen
“My mom is Spanish”
Guess what, they’re still broke after college haha😂
They should have blind folded them I feel like they were just hating on each others to get the vote
Who the hell eats dry Ramen with no liquid at the bottom?    Mind blown. How can you mess up noodles and seasoning?
They going off script.
This is one that I'd win in 100%
All jokes aside you're supposed to have ramen with a whole ass broth, a *soup* so all 3 of these dont make sense...
It literally blows my mind they don’t have broth in theirs and don’t like hers cause of that, weirddd the broth is like my favourite part
Let's be honest everyones ramen looked like straight up shit. These people need to stay broke for the nasty ramen they made.
ALL THAT SMACK ONLY TO LOVE THE BROTH RAMEN THE MOST
why was the cheetah print ramen so dry and looked like a brick 😂
She really said "imma win" then came in last place 💀
No hate but the cheetah print girl ramen looked dry as ever
Lmfaooo I knew cheetah was gonna lose
2:07 Me: does she think she’s a f*ing baby “ArE yOu TrYinG tO kIll mE?😤😫😩🥺😢😭
RAMEN HAS BROTH YOU IGNORAMUS
.... has nobody beard of an egg and a quarter chicken broth cube? An egg poaches in 3 min, ramen cooks for 3 min  Coincidence? I think not
Pov cheetah print: rawmem
bruh.. its a bit watery?? thats how it's supposed to be! The other stuff isnt ramen im sorry
“I prefer my ramen a bit dry” yea we could tell
“iT’s CoMiNg iN wItH a DiFfErEnT vIbE, iT’s CoMiNg iN wItH a DiFfErEnT fLaVoR”        …
It’s ramen not yakisoba why tf is it so dry💀
@pewdiepie
Oh my GOD, it's "Watery", girl, you aint eating spaghetti......
It’s pronounced raman in my family (i have a wierd family) my family is masters at cooking ramen (yes we spell it normal  The japans people cook it 10-12 minutes
I like ramen with over easy eggs  Especially cheesy ramen
"there's not enough shrimp" Boy i thought you were broke
'It's watery' is really taking me out🤣🤣🤣 the fact they are hating on the reman cause it has broth to it, like regular ramen does💀💀💀 also why y'all give these people spoons🤣🤣🤣
THE FACT THAT THEIR USING SPOONS INSTEAD OF FORKS
They don’t like the water 😭 my mom would of died if  she heard that even if it’s dry is still needs a little water 😭
The reactions to the ramen, I can't imagine any of these people were EVER broke college students. Plus all the stuff they added to it? Nah. You get the instant ramen from the store, you use the msg flavor packet it comes in, or if it's a cup soup, already have it mixed in, and you stuff it in a microwave, even though it says not to microwave it.
I searched up Try by Pink and this video came up-
ramen comes with "water" cuz ramen is the japanese word for noodles and ramen comes with broth, noodles that don't come with broth isn't ramen its either pasta, dipping noodles or just noodles dont give it the title of ramen when it isn't even ramen
The girl with the Tiger shirt annoying asf like we get it U LIKE YOUR ramen we don’t
do these people not know what soup is good lord
Marcus and Oluwamayowa were so obnoxious, didnt deserve to win. Cheyenne is nice, funny and her ramen actually looks hella good and cooked in the right way
Olu did the most to come out the worst to funny
Ramen has broth 😭😭 what is going on
Why you gotta call em broke 😂
Why is everyone black?
Rich Africans are more bojuee than rich African Americans.
i LiKe mY rAmEn a bIt mOrE dRy Girl we could tell
She complains about spice but that’s what’s the most important part
5:36 «i prefer mine a little bit more dry..» her ramen looks clumby and dry lolol
this is making me wonder if the cheeta girl is being satire to her own ramen
MY GUY ITS RAMEN THE FUCK YOU MEAN WATERY????
Olu clearly doesn’t know what ramen is lol
"I don't like all the water". Umm... excuse me bitch, it's RAMEN. It's suppose to have broth! This ain't pasta. My asian spirit gonna choke a bitch, OH MAH GHAD.
I can cook better ramen than all of those with just some boiled water
Dry ramen💀
They clearly never had real ramen it is supposed 2 have broth and be moist
DRY RAMMMMMEN 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Y r they EATING RAMEN WITH SPOOOOONS😡😡
🤣 the girl played her ramen up so well my mouth started to water then I saw chucks and I immediately lost my appetite and what's wrong with wet ramen it's called a broth lol
honestly none of these were ramen except for cheyanne, the whole point of ramen is that its supposed to be like a soup
It’s everyone underestimating the last girl lol.
why are these ppl complaining about broth like what is all this water... it's ramen???? do you understand how ramen works and how its usually eaten???????
The Nigerian girl was talking all that noise 😭
Africans vrs ramen!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cheetah girl is extremly rude
Use the flavoring packet and add fresh tomato, onion and celery (along with maybe a mushroom or any herbs you may like), it's simple but flavorful.   Plain old flavor packet and water with noodles always felt a little salty, so when adding everything else, the packet seasons well. You can afford to use a little less water since the vegetables themselves have water, but the broth comes out tasty for instant ramen imo.  1 fresh tomato chopped into (maybe an inch?) pieces 1/4 to 1/2 an onion (also not necessarily diced, but pieces you're comfortable spooning or forking) 1-2 Celery sticks  Boil that for maybe 3-5 mins before adding noodles and flavor packet and cooking as directions indicate.
The Nigerian girl really thinks she's something
I love putting egg and cheese in my Ramen
The nigerian girl my mom would use crayfish in foods bruh ew uh nah man im good, like they hyped it up oof.
*Dont worry everyone is a broke college student unless your parents are rich and they care for you its not a rare situation to be poor in college, no shame kings and queens, like you fresh out childhood dont sweat. :)*
*See I love existing in the age of technology because here not only is everything significantly easier but you also get quality content served to you fresh like this ^^*
Idk why people don’t understand that ramen is soup based so it’s meant to have a lot of water
does anyone realize that they  are using spoons <:(
It makes me so mad that they complain about broth in RAMEN. IT'S RAMEN. NOT NOODLES.
There are directions on the packet
I’m 10 and i can make ramen better then these people
Marcus is being so rude
LMAO GIRL YOUR FOOD IS DRY AS HELL RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WATERY THERE'S MANY WAY TO EAT A RAMEN
Maruchan creamy chicken with cheese, you’re welcome
Bro what? Y’all need to come to the trenches for this one.
Where tf is the water or lemon juice get a mexican up in there come on now
“Its saltyyy”      10 seconds later “season your ramen”
"come on guys it's ramen"   *Where tf is the broth then?*
Where's the soup...  Ramen is supposed to have soup  It's literally the broth
I mean not to take this to serious but the guy and the girl with the Afro are assholes bro 😂
WHYD THEY EAT IT WITH SPOONSS
People complaining that there's no broth when ramen can be with or without broth
girlie RAMEN IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE DRY. overall look and ingredients, Cheyenne's ramen is the most realistic
They don’t know what their talking about 😂
tbh I don’t understand why everyone is talking abt how the ppl in the vid didn’t like the water? I get it but like- some people like to eat their ramen without broth/soup and that’s totally fine, we get that you weren’t satisfied with them not putting broth/soup in her/his ramen but it’s totally fine with me? 😃
bro it literally says to cook it in broth on the packaging jesus christ
the fact that she said “my first instinct is to smell it, yk so I make sure I’m not eating anything.. *BAD* ..“ like babe ur “ramen” was dry clumps of noodles😭😭
Y’all rude saying their broke I mean it probably true but still
TL,DW: person with the most pride in their cooking always does the worst.
Bro where is the broth
As a chinese person like... two of em felt that it being watery was weird? like BRO ITS RAMEN, IT HAS SOUP...... This entire thing was just awful, the ones without the soup looked like smth cheap I could get in 7-11 as a snack but worse... like fried noodles, but clumpy? PLEASE no. The one with the chicken was much better than cheetah girl. Cheetah girl the heck you doing with that nasty ramen?   The only one that looked proper delicious was the one who won, but man, what the contestants said about that one I'm so like,,,,,,,,,,, bruh look at what you're eating.......  Edit: Mans said it feels slimy, and thats fair.. like, the bowl was probably there for a while, so it wasn't fresh, and the noodles absorbed the broth. But also you could tell he wanted to backtrack so hard when he said that ramen was good? He was like wait im here to win, lemme take another bite and make up some reasons to give a lower score.. Like you could tell my mans was backtracking so hard.
Naa all of them make dead ramen, I'm 15 and my ramen is banging that looked like indome or something I make koka tomyum noodles try it and thank me later its also better with a bit of broth and lunch meat
Lmao Marcus and Olu acting like the ramen noodles from Cheyenne ain't how you make actual ramen like her ramen was the best 🧍🏻‍♀️
> "using seasoning the other participants wouldn't even know" > calls some Sahara noodle type of shit ramen, and when it does have soup, it isn't dry enough  Bro eat proper ramen first
Damn.... That thing shouldnt be even called Ramen at all, Ramen is a SOUP (PASTA with BROTH) not dry lump pasta,even instant noodles would be offended xD
Ramen is deadass soup bruh WHERES THE SOUP
She said it was to salty but then 5 seconds later she said it had no flavour🤨 And her ramen was gross so she definitely
As an Asian i was so confused WHY DONT THEIR RAMENS HAVE BROTH.
Ramen is a soup dish it's not supposed to be dry. Smh
Watch me chop a green onion on it and win this like damn
It’s not water, it’s broth!
"It's too salty are you trying to kill me" "It's not flavorful it needs more seasoning" All in the same rating. Make it make sense.
The most I add to my ramen is hot sauce and chili powder. I prefer the ramen that comes in a cup.
"it's a bit watery I like mine dry" yeah girl... We can tell
the girl WITH THE BUSH HAIR is criquting the other girls ramen like she did better then her when in reality she got an 2 so I DONT WHO WHO SHE IS ACTING LIKE GORDON RAMSAY SAYING THE RAMEN WAS WATERY. bitch your ramen was literal playdough like just stop
always teh one talking all the trash that food is shit
I’m a 14 year old and I can make way better ramen than all of them…
*I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO SEE THE RUDE PERSON LOSE* 😍👏🏼
Lou is really mean and disrespectful plus her tasted the worst she sucks she’s mean disrespectful and rude.
Mfs dont like broth😔💔
ofc there all black and they poor
MY Questions Is WHY ARE THEY EATTTTTTTINNGGGG WITH A SPOOON?
put one shrimp🧍🏼‍♀️
The treatment you flavorless bitches gave Olu is so ugly and yes its because she's darkskin, "oh shes rude" it's a competitive and judgy tiny competition and you're all just making excuses to talk down on her, also @ the fact most of you saying this ugly and annoying shit are white/white adjacent
imagine eating ramen and complaining about salt
That one girl was so full of herself💀
Why did they all look so unappetizing 😭 like where was the seasoning from the packet
RAMEN COMES WITH BROTH. 😭😭😭😭😭
the girl in the cheetah shirt 'olu' was bragging about how good it her ramen is  and everyone hated it lmfao
It’s called broth. As being Korean I prefer spicy without but no spice I prefer broth
Can we talk about how fine Marcus is? What's his ig? I wanna follow 🥺
It's always people with the worst food doing the most. How you giving out 3s when you have 2? 🤣🤣
Wtf is this video lmaooo
olu was way too arrogant I’m kind of glad she lost
I did not like olu she was kind of rude and very disrespectful about it
This shit ain't even ramen. Y'all forgot the broth 😭😭💀
That ramen was fucking raw 💀💀💀
Olu had a lot of nerves.... dry behind noodles😮‍💨😮‍💨
You’re telling me that the rest of them cooked Maruchan without the broth? It’s a crime you used Maruchan, it’s even worse that there’s no broth. One took out all the flavoring and put chicken, the other mushed up the dry noodles and put hella seasonings on it.   But tbf, their noodles were probably left out for hours in the studio too, that could be why they look and taste so nasty.
All of their ramen looks p shit
The fact they eating noodles with a spoon is beyond me
I put pickle juice and tajin in mine🍽
These videos would be sooo much better without the bitter salty attitude. Its hard to believe the critiques when they come across as lies and dilberate low grades so they win.
Appropriating Asian culture is what I see
These aren’t no broke as kids. They are just college kids with made up degrees. They’ll be price gouging their clients.
i feel like the people spend more time on being shady than giving an actual honest review
Ok but why are they using spoons?
ramen is supposed to be a soup not a meat substitute
not the its too watery
just wanna introduce them to some spam and an egg. that's all you need.
Man all of y'all ramen look wack 🤣
"i prefer my ramen a bit more dry" yeah we know 😐
Where did they go wrong?  When they stepped into the kitchen.
Like Olu needs to get an exorcisim fr shes a demon. like that personality, nah sis.
Lmao!!! Can't be the same people who say white people can't cook 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  None of y'all have taste buds 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like my ramen fern but not crunchy
Olu: my ramen is the best Everyone else: funny
It’s ramen for Pete’s sake. Cook it however you fancy it. But the shocker to me is when I first discovered people eating it straight out of the package uncooked. WTF. But I’m not one to judge
The cheetah print girl said that the guy's ramen was dry like yours aren't even cooked-
Cheetah print girl: My ramen is bringing a whole new spice and flavour  The other people: 👁___👁
Why TF did they give them spoons to eat noodles..
Olu: '''I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry''  Ya we saw that girl 😑
I don’t how they commented each other food and taste. It’s how they like. It’s kinda bad listening to this
Isn’t ramen supposed to have water
is it just me or is the last one actually the best since it has soup because I'm pretty sure its meant to have soup
I like how the Jamcian girl was downgrading their food and talking alot of crap and thinking hers was gonna win when she had the worst one.
This is ramen blasphemy. 💩
As a asian at first the rude girls ramen to me looked like someone just took a ramen packet, opened it, broke it in to little pieces, and seasoned it.. im sorry thats what I thought it was 😰
I hope this is a joke 😂
2:19 Of course thats coming from you
These people are way older than me and half of them don’t know how to make ramen omfg no seasoning in sight 😭 shit is dry asl too
That girl with the fro is a pos you can just tell
Who eats noodles with a spoon?
The African girl thought her being foreign and using CAYENNE PEPPER 🙄 was going to win her this even tho the ramen wasn’t cooked. 😭 Ata gun gun is freaking cayenne pepper, dry hot sauce
college kids. they 18 and u call em kids. get a grip
this is the biggest thing broke college students can flex on each other
notice how they all black
Ramen's supposed to have broth... Docking scores because you prefer making it unconventional is so weird to me.
Cheyenne did it correctly
Salsa Valentina,Lime and saltine crackers 🤷🏽‍♀️❤️
dang "broke college kids"
I'm horrified that the two are hating on ramen for having broth 💀
Ramen has too much water? Every ramen ive had is a soup, with a broth.
Cheyenne: this is my ramen. Me: U WIN RN FR U GOT THE DUB. YO RAMEN ACTUALLY HAS BROTH! This aint Mi Goreng Competition THIS IS RAMEN, RAMEN. ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH
shakesauce
Valentina and lemon
WHERES THE SOUP BROO THIS AINT RAMENNNN :(((
The cheetah print girl is too confident 😭
Isn’t ramen supposed to have water in it?
“it got no color” - the garbage ramen girl” bruh hers had absolutely 0 texture or color
You know it's bad when crushed dry ramen looks more appealing than all of those bowls
Yo all them judgy Af But their ramen sucks
I know my ramen into yakisoba
Ramen is served with soup not dry ughh
Did girl just say my mom is Spanish
Spoon? Wth? Spoon? If not chopsticks then a fork .. wth is this spoon? 🤦🏻‍♀️😑 Edit: are these people serious? Ramen should have water .. read instructions! Also authentic ramen has lots of broth! 🤦🏻‍♀️ I can’t. These people are uncultured and it hurts
WHY DO YOU EAT RAMEN WITH A SPOON
omg yall  think ramen w/ a spoon is weird!??!?  IT IS MEANT TO BE EATEN WITH SPOON AND CHOPSTICKS-   bruv ist from chinatown.
Where tf is the broth? 🤣
her:”it’s salty like are you trynna kill me”  also her:”SeAsOn ThE RaMeN tHe RaMeN maTtErS”
Why a spoon bruh forks are better in my opinion lol with hot sauce
I love how the tiger print girl got the lowest rate
They don't like having a broth for ramen? They must be really broke...
When he said, “This shit looks dry as hell” I died!
I'm curious to see how the cheetah print girl reacts when she learns she only got a 2💀
Why are all their Raman dry?
That Owhhjdhgvbwtt girl was too cocky for my taste. U gotta 2 girl😆
The girl with the poofy hair is so pretty!
Do people not like instant ramen with soup in it😅
bushy hair lady lil rude
Why are they eating it with a spoon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i've never seen a person complain that ramen is too watery, its literally comes with a broth for a reason, all the flavor is in that.
Bro where’s the broth💀💀💀💀
People who don’t eat their ramen with the broth are insane
Bro have they never had a cup of noodles or something. You drink the soup part of it. It's so dry without the water. WTF
I was thinking to myself. I really hope the rude chick loses and I was not disappointed 😂
Ok so I think it’s safe to say none of them have had actual Ramen. With broth 😀 it literally says on the package “ramen noodle soup.” IT HAS BROTH
Is this hair 3:35
ramen is literally soup noodle 💀💀💀ma lord
No one likes cheetah girl
ITS JUST FUCKING NOODELS
The cheetah print girl " I would put my Ata gungun to give it more of a colour" Girl 😂u arent even supposed to be talking
the cheetah girl is proof that gorgeous gorgeous girls don't know how to make a meal
She said a "little more dry". Like you're Ramen was rawwww lmaooo
I’m not a person who likes to judge but can we just talk about Olu’s ramen  It didn’t even looked like it was cooked
These people…. Dry ramen?! What the-
" the ramen looks a little water" wait babes isnt ramen supposed to be eaten with soup-?
Cheyenne seems like a sweet person honestly
Like the confidence nd attitude kills me....ig u gotta blind fold 'em nd let them taste their own ramen brh 💀
“ my moms spanish “ LMFAOO
What the fuck is that. those 3 shits aint ramen... bruh not even an egg or soup or any veggies... what about meat? like real meat... you can get really cheap meat at the store like chicken hears legs or necks... Oh my lord what a waste of noodles.
Bruh they called them broke.
Olu likes it the way she likes it and girl just have an extroverted persona. I don't find her rude at all !   ...but hay to each with their own.
I know Mrs girl did not complain about RAMEN SOUP HAVING BROTH IN IT listen normal people aren’t trying to eat seasoned noodle chips
4:30 I feel like I’ve heard so many people say that on this show LMAO
Nah they all lost cause they got I’d of the water 😭😭
So I knew the one girl was African before she said it cause Africans are usually pretty competitive and negative....I figured her food would be the worst...because have you ever tasted African food
I put cheese in chicken flavored ramen...and add scallops a little basil..and oregano and pepper
She doing too much like her was in cubes😭😭
Ramen is a soup.... they mad she made a soup 🤣 🤣 🤣
I beg someone to take these people to an actual restaurant that serves ramen and have them ask for no broth. You will be laughed at. 50% of ramen is the broth and then the other 50% is the noodles, veggies, and meats (if you get meat)
Why are you guys targeting Olu? She made the kind of ramen SHE liked. She was confident because SHE knew she liked it. Everyone has their own preference. At least she was confident. About half of the people in the comment section don’t have an ounce of the confidence she has. At least she stuck to Nigerian spices and what she grew up with.
My ramen would have beat these 🤪 Chicken bouillon , garlic powder , onion powder  Cilantro ,onion an egg With sriracha & a lime 🔥
i forted
"I prefer my ramen more dry" yeah, I guess we all noticed it
Reman😂
I can tell why they were broke
first of all chey carried y'all just some fucking weirdos
Why are they made that the soup has soup in it lmao "I like my Raman more dry" THATS WHY YOURS WAS CRUNCHY
how you gonna complain about there being ‘water’ in the ramen😭
Who eats ramen this dry?!?! They all seem pretty unappealing to me
is it just me or is it weird that all the "broke kids" are black?
Bro?? I'm confused but don't you cook ramen with water and it's soup. Or westerners just cook different
dawg who tf eats ramen dry and criticizes people who love the broth
they re not broke they eat outside thats what it is
Miss cheetah print needs to remember shes not on master chef and needs to relax
nigga looks like ceeday
as an Asian, why tf r u eating rem with no broth, I need to give them a cooking lesson INSTANT RAMEN
I like how they’re complaining about how it has water but ramen is supposed to be a noodle soup 🤡
2 pickies, one nice. Great competition
The broth is the best part! With a cracked egg (and cheese to be fancy😁)
No offence but out of all of their ramen I would eat Cheyenne's
“Not tryna be rude it’s a 2 and it’s dry no flavor I got flavor in mines” Others:😂😂😂I can’t eat this 😂😂😂 it’s a 0 , SHE MAD PICKY AND COCKY BRUH
DRY RAMEN? Do they know that ramen is basically noodles with broth?? My asian self screamed and about spices ramen literally comes with its spice packet just use that and some basic things like: soy sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, chilli flakes and an egg on top.
It said they made the Ramen and brought it in... I've never eaten Ramen that's been sitting for ac while, but I imagine the texture goes off a bit and it dries out. They should've brought a hot plate/microwave and let them make it fresh. Cheyenne's was perhaps too wet, but sauce was a good idea since it had to sit. Just not so much.
Shout out to the shrimpssssssssssssssss that saved the day.... lol
This is fascinating to see the way people eat their ramen to spice things up. I've always pictured ramen with a soupy broth. Reasons why there are broth mixes on store shelves. Of course, I know there are dry noodles. Most times they are served with a dipping sauce such as cold or chilled soba. I'm not a fan of dry ramen though. Lol
Do people not eat ramen with a broth???
how i make my ramen:  boil the water and add the seasoning packet in and then the ramen. while its cooking  add an egg. after its cooked add some cheese, this is optional but it gives it more flavour and i also like to add some spring onion :)
“Shoutout to the shrimp who saved the day”  “It looks kinda grey” “Next”  Just these tiny comments are so hypocritical. You wanted everyone to love it and yet yours was dry nothing saved the day in your ramen. Ramen is meant to have “water” and look like a “flood” no offence but she is very rude and if she was in my college I would not talk to her
Shit talkers through and through
ran away from buzzfeed just to find out this is a buzzfeed account
it’s ramen… it’s supposed to have broth….
Remen is how she said it
Oluwamayowa mo shinderu! Nani!!
ramen is essentially  a soup bruh why you all questioning why it has water in it? lmao
The ramen has to have water personally none of those college students know how to cook ramen except for Cheyenne CUZ SHE PUTS WATER.
3:12 I LITERALLY LOVE HIM WTF😅😅
So do people not eat ramen with the broth?
90% of the Ramen should be the broth
The cheetah print girl is so damn annoying and cocky….
these mf stupid as hell complaining about ramen being watery like its soup you dumbfucks
Stop they do realize that you’re supposed to have some broth/liquid in ramen right 💀💀
when the 2nd ramen came up and the girl was just staring around trying to see if it was a prank😭😭
Girl: “Mine actually has tastes, it actually has flavor”  *Ramen turns out dry**
why can no one cook ramen omg
Bro these people need some sense
DO THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT RAMEN NEEDS SOUP IN IT. WHY THEY COOKING IT DRY?????? 😭😭😭
I thought I couldn’t cook
the way they dont like how its watery? isnt that how its supposed to be? 😭
Please the cheetah person should be rlly embarrassed. Second hand embarrassment. And also Marcus. Don’t you feel dumb? “It’s too watery” ITS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT. Those two are honestly the dumbest and annoying ever
Is no one  goin to talk abt how they were eatin ramen wth a spoon-
all of those look horrible
the only ones i would eat is Cheyenne's
Who cares about consistent when you're broke for real broke?! And shrimp is expensive, chicken maybe affordable after payday. Use the pack of seasoning in the ramen or maybe a old pack of soy sauce from panda express from months ago from that time ur folks took you out to eat lol
I ain’t even finish the video but the “water” in the last bowl supposed to be there bruh ramen supposed to be in broth
As an asian person.. im dissapointed tht only 1 person made a ramen with broth the others just yk fried noodle, sure fried ramen ig but no..
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ALL THESE NIGGAS COMPLAINING THAT THERE'S *WATER* IN THEIR RAMEN?!?  IT'S LITERALLY CALLED NOODLE SOUP!  SOUP!   THE ORIGINAL WAY TO EAT IT IS AS A MOTHERFUCKING SOUP!  IT'S OK THAT YOU LIKE DRY NOODLES, BUT THE FACT THAT LITERALLY ALL 3 OF THEM COMPLAINED THAT IT HAD *TOO MUCH WATER *, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW RAMEN IS ORIGINALLY MADE.   LITERALLY NOT A SINGLE RESTAURANT IN THE FUCKING WORLD, MAKES THEIR RAMEN DRY! LITERALLY! NOT A SINGLE ONE! ALL OF THEM MAKE SOUP!  THESE NIGGAS ARE BIASED AND BACKWARDS AS FUCK!
Yall EVERYONE knows Ramen has broth. This video is crazy
What the hell did they do with the broth...?

I laughed so hard at the title 🤣
The guy had the best ramen she wack for that 2 rating dry ass cristy dusty ramen and who tf puts crayfish in a struggle meal are you in Louisiana c'mon bruh

The girl with the ponytail was the most respectful and nice one here
I put hotdogs and cheese in mine 😅
You are suppose to have soup in your ramen. Its originally has soup in it so that its not a damn try burnt noodle.
The title is traumatizing
I wanna know why they are eating them with spoons
The Cheyenne girl was rude to the cheetah girl and she was ghetto
5:56 bruh no shit they have nothing on them the noodles are in broth the flavor comes from the broth u trippin
"it has water" "it's a bit watery"  YES AS IT SHOULD!! RAMEN COMES WITH BROTH!!
What they are broke and are eating crayfish and shrimp?!
Respect to the people who first saw this vid from ShakeSauce
Lol Olu was so confident 😭
I knew the picky ones ramen would taste like doodoo
Cheyenne wins 100%, theres water, which makes it 10x, good shrimp, good seasoning, amazing
''I would add my antugoon to this recipe i mean it dosen't have a lot of color'' girl shut up about antugoon  ur not that special
Olu really pisses me off
Girl really said “I’m not tryna be mean but I don’t like it at all”
She scored 2/20 LMFAOOOOOOOOO
Yes ma’am oyster sauce
Never been so made about ramen “it’s a big watery” ITS MEANT TO BE THAT THE BROTH MY GOD
“I don’t like the water” it’s ramen lol
No one gonna talk abt how there eating with spoons… just me? Ok
"I don't like all the water, it looks like a tsunami hit"  Japan, ramens origins: 🧍🏾‍♂
Ya'll really out here cookin ramen with nokindabroth?! AND using a spoon?! What?!

The last girl that’s kinda how I like mine I make mine a soup and the ramen is chew not slippery
As an Asian and even a human I'm so surprised that it's apparently hard for people to understand how to boil instant ramen for 10 minutes and follow basic directions on the packet...
man lou was talkin so much smack but her ramen is the worst she’s annoying asf tbh
It's called broth not water. <333
Wtf why are these people so rude 😆 I don't like these people
why do they keep referring to the broth as water, how the fuck can these people be this stupid
"it has water in it" dude im going to commit self harm
I like a little Mayo and tuna in mine 🤷🏾‍♀️
them complaining about watery ramen when that's my favorite part :(
Mean asl 💀
Oh heck no lol! My broke ramen looks like a restaurant style. I make yakisoba, yum mama and chow hor fun noodle version lol.
I’m going through these comments and all I’m gonna say is me a westerner, agree that ramen should indeed have broth.
The most rude people rate thing's low because they know they will get a low rating.
LOL
watching them eat it with a spoon hurts
cheetah gurl said it was salty and then she said only the chicken is seasoned ngl she gives me secondhand embarassment she kinda rude tho and the way she makes her ramen too
Lmao the fact the cheetah print girl lost and was so sure of herself lol
Bruh let me cook those you won't regret it
The cheetah girl: "whY Is ThIs sO SaLtY... Y'all trying to kill me?" Me: "Probably"
The girl said the ramen was too salty then she said The Ramen have no flavor🤔
It’s literally sickening that people even have to be poor during college just to get treated like crap.
When I wanna show someone what karma is
do people not like the Noodle broth??! I fckn love noodles with broth
Broke college students be like “not enough shrimp “ let me throw some lobster and truffles in there for you buddy!
00:23 FAKE ASS VOICE COMPARED TO THE BEGINNING
when the cheetah girl said her food was coming in with a different vibe she rlly meant it
what is the girl with the cheetah print being so rude for🤨
“This ramen has no color”, umm ma’am, why does it need color to taste good? Tf
Ramen has too much water    Ummmm.......... Really? I was making it wrong the whole time!!!!!
I add lemon and paprika to my ramyun.. turns out good
so basically the two contestants are saying they don’t like broth?? yk the part of the ramen that gives the noodles flavor?? 😭 💀
Attitude 🙄 lol🤣🤣
“My moms Spanish”
Do they not know that ramen is a soup?
bro how they all make shitty ramen
me who grew up crushing the ramen in the pack, putting the seasoning packet and eating the pieces as a snack😀
All of them judged the appearance before they could even taste it lol
honestly all of their ramen looks dry an disgusting
Okay but the recipe with oyster sauce and Sriracha is a recipe that Chinese people cook sometimes
Why these brokes act so spoiled like what😂
So I think I am endangered human being...cause like- I CAN'T STAND AF RAMEN!!! How do you cook ramen for it to just be dry again? If it doesn't have a soup in it I am NOT going to eat it... 👁_👁....AM I THE ONLY ONE-!? I also like to add an egg or two fried or boiled with some seasonings and it's really filling it could be a complete meal 🤔
Ramen is meant be watery
"There's not enough shrimp"  sir this was made with struggle , and when they were broke what u want ? resturant style ramen shit
Cheetah girl says it’s too salty and proceeds to say “season ur ramen”    Me: ??? Which one is it? Is it salty or not??
idk the cheetah girl gives me the vibes of “caviar dreams on moonshine pockets” like with how she was talking about how good and amazing her ramen was
For any ramen in the microwave:  -Ramen pack in large bowl with too much water. -Into the microwave for 7 minutes. -Take it out at 3 minutes, and pour out enough water to be slightly above the ramen. - Mix in the seasoning packet and pot it back in the microwave for the last 3 minutes. - take out and stir   For shrimp flavor, add lime juice, old bay, and whatever hot product you want - for chicken, you can use adobo, lemon, and add sour cream to make it creamy - You cant go wrong with cayenne pepper
Do this people not know that ramen comes in a broth. It's noodles with soup. You want dry, go eat pancit!!
all of them did horrible
i’m convinced they made this video just to teach these two about broth 🤣
I mean there are dry ramen/noodles like pancit canton, indomie and stuffs... But damn their ramen looks dry af—
SO NIGERIAN RAMEN : DRY CLUMBS OF UNCOOKED DRYED DOUGH {WITH SEASONIN}
Ramen has a broth bc it’s a soup. Lmao who wants to just chew on noodles. Just my opinion.
i got so confused when their ramen barely (if any) had broth........... like?? i thought it was mandatory for ramen to have soup??
It's funny cuz she criticized the guy's ramen about it being flavorless and dry but then she criticized the other girl's ramen cuz she "likes it a little dry"
its a soup 😭 it’s supposed to be “watery”
Pls I want the girl reaction by getting a 2😭
I guess the watery Raman tasted better maybe because the water is actually soup!
Ramen is nothing without soup 💀
wait people eat ramen without water-
Cheeta girl said it was gonna kill her cuz it was too salty but also said it had no flavor no way lmao
Ramen is a tough one to take to-go or save for later. I think it would’ve worked better if it was straight out the pot! We all know you leave ramen and it just soaks up and gets gnarly
"I prefer my ramen more dry" oh we know.
The REAL CRIME in this video is that they were eating dry, plain ramen with a SPOON! Like there was no soup in it or anything so why a SPOON??
i love how the guy said that her noodles are dry and have no seasoning but his didn't either 💀💀
YALL DEADASS ATTACKING THE CHEETAH GIRL LMFOAOAOAOZKXJJSSIISIS
“Season the ramen, the ramen matters”  Me: Cook the ramen, the ramen matters.
y r they eating it w a spoon
Cheetah girl can go fuck off back  to Africa with her whack ass ramen 😂
ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE *WATER* ITS FUCKING BROTH ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DRY
please believe in God,Jesus died for your sins so that you can go to heaven,Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion,God and Jesus can help you..
Bro keep the broth
We just not going to talk about them using spoons to eat the ramen
‘i like my ramen drier’ bestie we know we SEEN yours
I personally don’t like my instant ramen in water, but at least a bit of broth so it’s not dry
It's RAMEN! It's not supposed to be pretty or red! It's supposed to feed your broke collage a**🤣🤣
The way cheetah girl pronounced ramen tho. I mean how?
Did she just say that the chicken is just an accessory.
The like the ponytail girls noodles but they don't wanna admit it
Did anyone just click on the video because of the girl face
if i just made regular ramen noodles by following the instructions id win
“It’s salty…season the ramen it has no taste”
so no one is talking about the girl saying "My mom is spanish" 1:47 lmao
“ I prefer my ramen a little dryer “    Yes dry clumps of ramen.
I like mine with broth. As long as the broth is tasty. A little or a lot, but sticky noodles just aren't as satisfying as steamy, brothy noodles dripping with flavor.
RAMEN IS A NOODLE SOUP omfg “watery”🤦🏾‍♀️
"omg it's so salty" IT'S RAMEN LMAO
The ramen isn’t watery. It’s ramen broth. It’s supposed to be there!
My ramen better than all these jokes i put ramen of choice- beef or chicken only seasoning it comes with, lawrys, Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic power, slap ya mama cajun seasoning, roasted garlic and herb seasoning, chili flakes and extra hot red hot. Hot sauce 👌🏽 thank me later - ( little little bit of seasoning alot of parsley and Italian seasoning since its not too salty
Please that’s not how Nigerians make ramen 😢😅
She was loud 💀💀
Have none of these people except the one exception ever heard of broth? It’s how ramen is suppose to be you idiots. Your opinion is invalid if you think otherwise, please step into oncoming traffic.
The girl said “my mom is Spanish”💀💀
I hate Boujee mfs lol but she got a low rating I'm so satisfied lol
is this their own style of ramen? as an asian the only ramen that looks like a ramen to me is the last one
All their ramen seems okay but like my fav cheap ramen is make the soup and ramen throw a little kimchi, green onion, boiled egg, hot pepper and fry up some garlic in sesame oil and throw that in too. It’s def a bit more work but still only takes 15 mins to make and tastes so good.   To me, ramen is a soup dish dry ramen is fine but it’s best with soup
Bro no one likes u cheetah girl go to hell like stfu
WHY ARE YOU EATING WITH A SPOON!!!
the girl didn't even try olus ramen so we did she vote
Who eats ramen with a spoon?!
Yall eat ramen with spoons- 😭💀
The fact that they dont know that ramen contains broth is sad
Ramen is a soup. Why are they suprised that there is water?!
That dude has NO space for talking. His ramen had no broth and was over cooked to hell dude. Worst one out of all of em
That ramen look salty and over cooked as fuuuuuuck😂 the first one
I live in the 70
*Breakfast* Milk - $4 per 2L Cereal - $5 Mega Box (4*2)+5 = $13 Month worth of Breakfast  *Lunch* Bread - $2 per loaf Peanut Butter - $5 (2*3)+5= $11  Month worth of Lunch  *Dinner* Rice - $2 per Kg Chicken Breast - $10 per Kg Frozen Vege - $3 per Kg (2*2)+(10*2)+3 = $27 Month worth of Dinner  13+11+27= $51 per month
all of their ramen looks disgusting.. my ramen is literally orange from spice😍😍and has tiny veggies
Do they eat the noodles and seasoning then drink hot water?
HELLO HUHUHUH WHAT FUCKING DRY RAMEN YOU EATING WHO DONT EAT RAMEN WITH BASE STUPOID MFS
do they know that ramen is noodle soup?
not the tsunami 😭😭
Do people not know what good ramen is “flavor I don’t see no sauce no nothing and when you have ramen soup the quote unquote water is the best part
Dudes this was terrible.
its not WaTeR! its broth
who tf eats dry ramen these hoes mental fr
THIS IS A DISRESPECT TO RAMEN EATING IT WITH A SPOON LIKE ARE U A PSYCOPATH
bro… the broth is literally what makes the ramen like yeah theres “nothing” on the noodles thats because the power is in the broth which then soaks INTO the noodles
The fact that they gave them a spoon instead of a fork/chopsticks is actually making me upset
“ i prefer my ramen a little more dry”… we can’t tell 😭
Cheyenne  look like smino's girl ebony davis
That Nigerian girl needs to learn wtf ramen is
I hate how they think ramen doesn’t originally have soup
They are called soup packets please, don't hate on the soup😭😭
do these people not know... ramen comes... in a broth... lol...
the saddest ramen I've ever seen wtf
The afro girl didn't even cook it and she was very cocky and rude
“There’s water in here…” y’all that’s called broth and it’s SUPPOSED to be in there😐
…where’s the broth?😀
The dude's description of cheeta girl's ramen is perfect and I don't even know what it tastes like.
The best part of this videos are the comments lmao
Deez bitches really actin like they taste testing a whole gourmet meal and they judging the color and stuff that don't matter but like...hello? They are literally taste testing Ramen that costs less than a dollar need I remind you
Spicy beef ramen with fried egg, chives, & baby bok choy I could eat it everyday lol
bro second girl was so confident and then look at the reactions 😂😂😂
"broke college students" ... Proceeds to put shrimp and/or chicken in it (meat of any kind is NOT cheap), and a bunch of spices you know we can't afford!
its not water its soup nigga
all there ramen is trash they dont have soup thats what makes it good
I love it when people who think are better are just rude and give the nastiest stuff . Stay humble . She gave low rating cause the color and cause it didn't have her seasoning lmao. I wonder how many people have actually lie to her about her culinary skills.
girl with cheetah came with too much arrogance
How hard is it to make ramen? Just warm up the water then pour it in the maruchan tf? I guess you can add eggs for an enhanced flavor but it's not that hard like fr they go to college but can't seem to figure out how to do a pre made food item? Sad
mine all about taste and flavor' isnt that the same thing-
Any asian would be PISSED watching this
„its salty“ but saying its unseasoned
all of them annoy me : )  soup is normal, and shrimp costs so much
Please as a Nigerian, please thats not how we roll
Ramen have soup. Fried noodles have none.
Are they that broke to not be Able to read that ramen needs water and it’s made for it to be watery 😩
LMFAOOO the girl in cheetah got HUMBLED
Cheetah girl:  "And to be Frank with you ... it has no colour"  Girl your ramen clumps were white. WHITE.😭✋
The pronunciation 🥴💀
“Like are you tryna kill me?!?! ugh” 😭😭😥😥😥”  LOLOLOLLLL 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
They’re all complaining about each other’s ramen preferences. Yet they all have different consistencies. Ramen is a soup, ramen can be eaten like a chocolate bar. I would eat any of their ramens and not say a thing about how it’s “bad”. You’re broke, eat the noodles.
remen wtf is remen it's ramen cruella
She gives me theater kid vibes, is she a leo?
I would’ve eaten that last ramen over anyones just by looking at it
please don’t bring back the cheetah print girl. i beg you
Why they got them eating ramen with a spoon 🤦🏽‍♀️
"i'd prefer my ramen a little bit more dry"  koreans after watching how they cook their ramen:👁️👄👁️🔪
WHO THE HELL *ISNT* COOKING THEIR RAMEN WITH BROTH ??
no cause them being so thrown off by Cheyenne's ramen having water in it when ramen's literally a noodle SOUP?? i'm so confused
they so broke they eating with spoons...
Ramen is supposed to water. You dont just eat ramen without broth. The broth is whats supposed to give it more flavor
them: the ramen is too watery me: there is barely even water on that
I put lemon and Valentina, they doing too much 😂
My own future is f college don’t go extra years to f highschool don’t listen to your parents to say be a doctor or go to college move out when you can so you got no annoying f siblings around you and yea
Omg it has chicken in it it’s giving me Spanish vibes cause my moms Spanish lol BITCH PLEASE 😂
That girl was talking so much crap saying her noodles were the best but then her noodles are crap like her
Lmoa the girl in the cheetah print was so confident and was trashing on everyone else but they both said her ramen was trash
Broke people don’t have chicken.  This meal has to cost under $0.50
Idk why so many people eat ramen without broth. It’s so weird to me.
"It's okay" "it's good actually" "it look from the road"  Why so much uncertainty in complimenting and so much generosity in picking mistakes and ugly points.  Education first make humans !
Let's all be generous with our praises.
Ramen is a soup, there's supposed to be broth in it.
Cheetah print girl is the most cringe ...
"I dont like all the wather"
My Ramen stir fry would won frfr....What college student got shrimp crayfish....Where the egg at????
It’s always the ones that think they’re better than everyone else that get the lowest scores 😂
My Hispanic people put Tapatío on there maruchan
No ones ramens is good
So no one thought to add hot sauce?
Y’all the girl isn’t mean it’s just her opinions
Chicken ramen with eggs in it thank me later (add tapitillo)
"I prefer my ramen a little more dry" YOU DONT SAY 😭💀
I always really like making my ramen using broth instead of water, a sprinkle of wasabi peas, and maybe a little soy sauce or some extra wasabi for a little more kick
ramen is not hard to supe up..... damn this is real embaressing for all parties xD
they all look gray to me
I love how dude said so much but took it all back after trying it
The cheetah girl talk about all the seasoning she added but had the audacity to call someone else too salty.
when i heard the cheetah print girl being so over cnfident i hoped she lost and she did...cause is that looked nasty!
They said being a college student is whack for example we have to pay for parking for food for water literally that is everybody
He said being broke sucks because I have to think about what I’m going to eat
Damn she/he really call them broke jhit trippin
"It's too salty" clearly never looked at the back of a ramen package before
And who eats ramen with a spoon TF
ALL THAT SHIT LOOKS LIKE DOG FOOD 🤣🤣
Hell nah they buggin y tf they using a spoon for it...
Stupid olu thought she was the best and turned out to be the worst , humble up olu u dumass😭
DON'T EVER SERVE THESE RAMEN TO AN ASIAN ! NEVER EVER ! PUT IT AT LEAST 10 m AWAY FROM US .
Girl in the black 😍
Am I the only one who's crying inside cause they are using a spoon
This shits trash
She said her mom is Spanish…….. 🤣🤣🤣🤣bruh she black as tarmac 🤣🤣🤣
I’m a bit triggered that they ate the noodles with a spoon
They gotta get me in these kitchens ong
why they gotta do em like that in the title
interesting
Cheetah girl: my first instinct is to smell to see if anything is bad. Also cheetah girl: ramen isn't cooked all of the way???
I'm sorry but I would KILL this competition.
“It has no color” yours does? Also have they never had like ramen? Like a ramen from the Asian market because why were they so curious and discussed by the soop?
i like my ramen without the broth so it’s basically like the seasoning packet with a bit of water, some butter, green onions and sometimes i’ll add soy sauce
RAMEN IS A SOUP ITS SUPPOSED TO BE WET!! Tf? Are they serious?? 😖🤨🤨
i was like "why they all black?" then i daw the channel was called cocoa butter
Why are they saying that with soup it is disgusting?? It's literally ramen Even if it's instant, it's still ramen, not pancit You don't go to a japanese restaurant and get D R Y ramen
This made me mad, like they are all so judgmental lol, and ramen needs water and the guy who insulted it fr made me cry 😿
All nasty.
6:22 and yours was amazing was it???
Here's one... try chicken ramen on 2 slices of bread 👌
Please someone say somthing why tf their using spoons for ramen 💀
The girl in the camouflage is lying. She said it’s salty. Then she said the only good thing is the chicken and the noodles aren’t seasoned. She is so desperate.
“its too salty like are u trying to kill me 😭😭”. Like stfu and show sum respect
why they so picky damn
All three of their recipes looked like absolute shit
i can feel the staffs laughing their asses off for that cheetah print girl...ifykyk
I feel traumatised by this.
She was so cocky and rude, you can tell she acts like that outside of filming, stuck up 🙄
This is satire, right?
Olu needed to chill tf out and got humbled
I'm sorry but them eating dry ramen is... you need the broth
😘
Olu was just hating , first it was salty then it has no taste 🤣🤣 she didn’t know what to say cause it was good .
who eats ramen with a spoon??? holy shit
you could’ve titled this something rlse dont just call them broke like that
bro the broth is literally the best part of instant ramen
Its was so funny how that girl with the cheetah shirt was so confident about her ramen yet still lost and she was rude about the other ramens when hers was trash
there's no way cheetah girl isn't from stan twitter right
I genuinely don't think any of them have ever even tried actual ramen. Maybe Cheyenne has had ramen before(her ingredients sounded okay and at least she had "wAteR",  as they called it) but the other two? I don't think they've ever even SEEN a bowl of actual ramen. Probably haven't even seen the emoji for ramen. Saying it's not dry enough? What???
ramen doesn’t keep in the fridge
Bruh none of y’all know how to cook ramen lol
As an Asian I feel like I need to give them all ramen lessons
These people are retarded.  Raman is literally suppose to be in soup … People call this Raman ?
Bro everything is wrong with this I’m sorry
“A tsunami hit and this was the ramen that was left on the street.”  Damn dude you didn’t have to do her like that 😂
“My Ramen is coming with a different vibe a different taste” ….. “this $@&$ look dry as hell!!!! Omg lol
She was saying the ramen dint have color😂like it was post to be a 5star dish
I'll give you a recipe that's helped me through school! Leave some water in the noodles Any ramen flavor of your choice 1 tblspn butter 1 tblspn Louisiana hot sauce 1 tspn mayonnaise (yes you'll thank me later) Shredded cheese (will melt in the "broth") And the seasoning pack!
Oluwamayowa sure doesnt seem broke
“I like my ramen dry” u ain’t eatin ramen girl
Are you tryna kill me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There's absolutely no way this is real and that's how they make their ramen...
Uh Ramen is literally soup and noodles, it's definitely supposed to have liquid.
Why they eating ramen with a spoon tho
ramen is supposed to have broth 🧍🏻‍♀️
That girl was saying the ramen needed seasoning and just before that was saying it was too salty like bruh
THE WATER IS WHERE THE FLAVOR ISSS
I can instantly tell Cheyenne is gonna win
"This ramen is too dry."  *me nodding along as I crunch my dry ramen cuz I couldn't decide how to cook it and watched this instead*
I dont eat ramen without color. idc if its green purple or cyan of all colors.
Broke boy tips. Eggs in ramen is very filling
Should this even be considered "ramen"????
do they know that ramen is traditionally a soup. Water is required smh
2022: 867
All of them looks bad
HE SAID SHE MADE CHEWED UP CRACKERS FOR RAMEN IM CRYINGGGGGGGGGG
never bring olu back. her personality is just no
How is it too salty but not seasoned
No cap all 3 failed I could do better lol 😂 first time I’ve said that in a while lol 😂
Who eat good noodles with spoons lol 😂. This the first seeing it ! And olu I just knew hers was nasty 🤮 it’s def gotta be a certain texture !
They're broke but they dress so DAMN FINE like how? 🥲
Ramen supposed to have some juice at least lol and rude girl got that trash rating- Dead
NAH. the cheetah one is pretty and stuff, but she was doing a lil too much.. "i would add my gungun to this recipe, to give it color, yknow?" why are we caring about the color more than the actual taste?
I literally want my ramen to be RAMEN with WATER because it's SOUP
Cheyennes looked most like ramen I'm used to, but wtf was up with 1 shrimp as a garnish? Maybe if it was a precooked frozen one you might put only 1 at a time as a broke student.
All there ramens are shit like the African girl was worried about colour so she gave them a lower rating
Geez these ppl need to chill
That African girl doesn't even know that there's other Africans I swear
No offence but they are really funny ngl
I think it's broke lol
Broke,brooke
I'm in grade school, and I can cook a full course meal not to mention my ramen is fire ash 😭
Ramen is literally a soup all of these ramen look shit
this whole entire video is embarrassing two of them just like uncooked ramen its literally supposed to be soupy what the hell 💀
theyre offended by "water" like cmon it's RAMEN. SOUP. IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE SOUP
I only have ramen with broth if it’s from an authentic restaurant but if I cook it at home I don’t use the broth or season packet that comes with it
I didn’t realize people actually ate ramen without liquid as a meal until today. I’ve eaten uncooked ramen as snacks, but not as a lunch.
Lol bruh just make ramen normally 🤦
olu let me down. the confidece> . the execution< ....
Ramen is so goddamn good if you make your own broth
I wish you got the reaction of the girl getting a score of 2
Bruh ramen has cloudy broth. These people can’t cook ramen but the instructions are on the packaging.
How the hell did only one person use water. ramen is soup i never seen someone eat soup with out the broth
Can we talk about how the girl who won is so pretty
im sorry but like, im sure the noodles may have been good by y’all could have at least added water( like left the broth in there ) bc dry ramen- idk man 😭 ( I kinda respect the gorl who left the broth )
how you gonna complain about ramen being too salty?? you ever look at the sodium in ramen????? gtfoh lol
I like how it says broke college student 😭
Woulda been better if they were told their scores
I love how the winner's was actually ramen and the other's was pasta haha
USE. A. FORK.🍴
Growing all we ate noodles especially with a big family lol it gotta be half cooked for sure a lil bit of soup to let it soak up flavor ..cut up some spam or hot dogs n some hot sauce oh a egg too lol 🤣  shit fire.
I LOVE dry ramen.. well. I don't like my noodles soaked in soup. But i prefer to drain 90% of it. Its delicious salt, pepper, hot sauce, whatever other seasonings you have. And chicken ofc
How and why do 2 of 3 college students not know how to actually cook prepackaged ramen?! 😭 When I was struggling I would add frozen corn, black pepper, spinach and an egg. And extra water with a bit of salt to make it go further.
Boil the noodles in water + half the pack of seasoning for 3 min, drain water put back in pot, add a ~tablespoon of butter or w.e works for u and the other half of the seasoning packet plus some spices outta the cabinet maybe Cayenne, onion and garlic powder and parsley.. there u go better than all 3 of these combined
I’d really like to see the losers reaction can we not get that footage?
Ramen is intended to be eaten with broth.. Americans started this weird dry ramen faze.
THE RAMES IS A BIT WATERY BITCH RAMEN IS A SOUP
I would've killed for the girl with cheetah print reaction when she didn't win ( as she should)
im just a teen and i cook ramen better than them !
They’re broke but have nice clothing, jewelry, makeup, etc? Yeah pretty sure they just suck at money management.
"its too watery i dont like th water" ITS CALLED SAUCE!
I wanted to see her reaction to hearing how bad her ramen actually was tho
Marcus:Salty Cheyenne:Sweet Olu:Sour. Was talking the most mess but ending up losing 💀
Olu is fuckjng annoying
bruh who the hell eats ramen with no water 💀
“it’s salty” BITCH ITS RAMEN.
She said it was too salty then that it’s not seasoned lol
wtf yall eat ramen with no broth??
She had noodle nuggets in her food 😭
I love how the title says “broke college kids” 😭
Cleary they no nothing about ramen.
WTH is wrong with them?? Ramen is a Soup where is the soup??
You’re supposed to keep the broth in the ramen.
She didn’t even add her “crayfish”😂
Since when was having broth a bad thing y’all mf’s eating dry ramen noodles missing out on some real flavour.
that clumpy ass ramen no bs just pissed me off, like literally wtf.
Are they eating ramen with a spoon😭?
The Nigerian girl is so pretty ✨queen✨ 👑 🇳🇬 but it’s the pride for me
How do ppl eat ramen without the soup?? 😭
i just want to know why everyone thinks ramen should be dry like the broth is the best part
me romen si the best but i got 2/10
are you traing to kill me wee weee
Y’all gone have to let me in on this I made bank selling ramen in my dorms should of took my butt to cooking school lol
Searching for the broth like 🔎
“It has no color”girl what color did yours have sis💀
Is it just me but i eat the ramen noodles by itself straight out the package..
Not them acting bougie 😭😭✋🏾
Cheetah girl eating rocks bruh
Dude the cheetah girl was so disrespectful and called all of them "unique" when a lot of people do that and called them gross but got the worst rating lmbo
This bi*ch   trying to make the ramen so special with her nigerian Atatagun
Bro where is the water
THEY WERE WRONG BY WAKING UP AND MAKING THIS 😭
that cheetah girl thinks she's the main character or sum💀
the fact that they are eating it with a spoon kills me
Olu: I prefer my ramen dry Me yelling at my tv: OF COURSE YOU DO, YOURS WAS SO DRY IT WASN’T EVEN COOKED ALL THE WAY
So, in conclusion, all their ramen kinda sucked.
who the fuck eats ramen with a spoon?
Wheeereeee is the brothhhh?!!
I like how they all taking smack abt each other’s ramen even none of they good
the girl in the cheetah print is taking me cause she was so confidenttt
This is painful but they trying ig?????
olu contradicted herself the entire time… first she said ramen was too dry then the second time around she said she prefers it dry…
The Asian in me is DISTURBED
eating ramen with spoon..? these ppl never eaten actual ramen before
Bro Ramon neeeeeeds that juice I hate when ppl drain all the water it’s SOUP 😭
I’ve never seen people eat their ramen dry…Isn’t ramen supposed to be a soup?
Why olu think spice is flavor or something
Why r they all black?
So, in my country a common way to eat ramen at school was to crush the ramen up before opening the package, then opening jt and putting the dry seasoning in and shake it up.. is good
The arrogant chick with the afro basically make prison style Ramen.
Why dey gotta be black
Bad for cheetah prints husband if you can't even get ramen right Lord knows what you do to a kitchen if you had to make actual food
I honestly wanna see how the other contestants react lol
Why the second one look like rice a roni
I love how confident Olu was, but then everyone hated hers loll
I got all them beat
"They went wrong by cooking"😭you know it was bad
The guy in the glasses... Id like your number please
All of their Ramen look nasty lmao
I can't watch people who don't understand what ramen is... judge ramen. This is painful.
This girl said raa man   NO HATEE🧋🧋🧋😋😋🤤🥟🤤
anyone who's done more then a week in jail could outcook all these losers with just 1 ramen pack, no water, no heat and maybe even without the seasoning pack LOL
The cheetah print shirt girl acted like she was running the show and forgot she was a guest lol 😂
Olu is wayyyyy to confident. Like girl it’s honestly embarrassing. She was talking down on everybody when she got a TWO
How wet ramen is better than drye ramen
Ramen is soup… its supposed to have a broth smh
The way she pronounce ramen as raw-men, had me cracking
Watching this to prepare to switch from online to campus. Paying out of pocket. Fml😁
Old got smoked amg 😅
It’s not that hard to make good yummy ramen
I have broth and potatoes in my ramen
NAHHHH THESE COMMENTS SOMETHING ELSE XDDDD
Not the guy beeing like "this is not fancy" bitch this is broke student food literally wtf
Omg I'm broke as f**k and yalls Ramen is still wack....I'd love to cook yall MY RAMEN....
Yall nasty af. Good and cheap ramen should still have broth and shouldn't be eaten dry. You can further add veggies and some meat on top of a softboiled egg to make it more enjoyable while being affordable
They’re so annoying, like the point is how people endure their struggles.
All of their ramen was a disrespectful attack on every Japanese person who has ever lived
I'm sure the rude girl wanted to rate them with low scores. so that her score is high er.
wait i thought they atleast had water to cook the noodles FULLY it looks like  they didnot try to soften it lol
all of them are annoying and have no idea what ramen is
None of these people know how to make ramen
justice for olu 😭 her ramen actually looked good
A packet of indomie and a fried egg goes a long way
I already knew who was gonna win lol
No broth no forks Wdf is this
Pizza rolls>ramen
3:03 the editors really did "Olu" dirty there 😂😂😂 and I'm all for it she was probably the most arrogant person there.
Why the caption gotta be “broke” nobody is talking about that .
As a Nigerian, I left the chat when Olu mentioned crayfish😭
Who made that ramen,  should be fired ,
mmmmmmm no this aint ramen this just noodles
How can she be rude and dead - Loski
College a struggle so I just buy those $1-2 cup ramen and call it a day.
The girl that had the most to say had the nastiest ramen her shit was in block form 😂😂😂
yea we dont like broth in our RAMEN
Nigerians make better Ramen than that.
How she say it’s salty but then say it has no flavor and needs to be seasoned.
5:27 your noodles look way worse😂
Yas ramen
Shrimp in ya ramen?! Not saying that's bad just saying that if ya that broke your probably not buying shrimp. 🤷🏾‍♂️. Also, ramen is supposed to have broth right?! 🤔 The dry chicken ramen probably would've been better with broth and not overcooked noodles.  Now that clumpy ramen?! Wtf.
Who eats ramen with a spoon….
LIKE DONT BE RUDE OLUWAMYOWA
Cheetah girl:my ramen comes with a different taste with a different vibe      YOU MEAN DRY SIS IT WAS LIKE MF ICEBURG GURL-
I ate no ramen noodles in college. I live at the Olive Garden and Friday’s, red lobster.
Do these people... not know what Ramen is? It's supposed to be "watery"
Cheyenne was the nicest. Everyone eat your ramen how you want, but don’t serve others was the conclusion of this instant ramen video lol
Olu just made no sense on marcuses ramen how are going to say it was too salty but then say season the ramen and the chicken was seasoned nicely girl your backwards asf
Their acting crazy like the soup wasn’t supposed to be in the ramen
No broth? 🤢
For me the only reason why the other two didn’t win is because they didn’t have the broth/water with the ramen ITS BETTER THAT WAY
Olu, you know better. Cmon now.
when they do not know what real ramen is
none of these people know how to cook ramen.... like you guys picked the worst contestants possible. (Except the girl with the siracha in hers, not the best but she was in the right direction)
The first mistake all of them did was bringing it from home. Instant ramen is suppose to be eaten fresh from the pot 😭
Dude, if you drain the broth before eating ramen you are mentally insane
Olu- “C’mOn GuYs iT’s RaMeN”  * Literally turns the ramen into a wilson football*
Bro I make a mean breakfast ramen
I don’t know why The girl in the leopard print assumes people have absolutely no amount of understanding when it comes to spices or flavor. Like how could you be so confidante against a stranger
Don't like the water???? Thats the broth ramen has broth its not ramen without broth its just flavored noodles
"It's salty are you trying to kill me?" Bruh It's ramen what are you expecting
So picky
Olu rly thinks that because she has her nigerian seasoning it saves her dry lookin ass ramen.
Olu is gorgeous but girl..get off your high horse.
Lol I just made some ramen
Um Ramen has water, I’m confused.
Everyone is so rude.
no broth? also, spoons?  haha
Cheetah print girl: I prefer my ramen a little dry" Also she: Turns it into The Sahara Desert*
Did they just say the ramen was watery? Ramen is a type of soup tf you they on bro.
Is it me does it all look dry
She just said it was salty
Bruh Ramen is watery? Are u kidding, I'm pretty sure regular Ramen comes with broth ngl. (Correct me if I'm wrong)
“IS THAT A HAIR? Nah nah I’m playing” HAD ME DEAD 💀. Byeeee
Yo Cheetah print girl was trying to make ramen balls lol
Isn't there supposed to be water in ramen like the last girls noodles looks the best
Sorry but where's the broth in the noodle 💀
I haven't seen a single other race on this channel... no latino, no white, no asian. Nada. Racist. Dislike.
Nobody like broth in they noodles
literally the point of ramen is SOUP AND NOODLES the water is basically half of the meal.
WHY ARE THEY USING SPOONS?!
It pisses me off that they're so urky about instant noodles like bruh if you got so much complaints about it go make yourself something that isn't "A STRUGGLE MEAL".   Seriously who complains "Not enough shrimp" ffs!
Bruh why with a spoon use a fork
Watery? Ramen is supposed to be full of a nice broth otherwise it's just noodles. None of them know what ramen is :(
Saddest ramen ever, just leave it in the cup
funny how they complained about the one element in the dish that was supposed to be there; Water.
I love how the nicest person won
"I`d prefer it more...dry" girl give me ur black card NEOW . and then the other boy is just idk tbh
Jesus that girl in the leopard shirt was ANNOYING AF
Have none of these people heard of the word broth?
They all don't have it maybe one got that noddles need  juice ! Other two like dry completely I can't eat with them
Who PREFERS RAMEN DRY
none of these people know how to make ramen I’m sorry but what is that? wow  clumpy ramen not even separated and no liquid and it’s over cooked do people not put the liquid in ramen? Ramen is soup. If you want just noodles try getting something called Mi goreng now that’s good
I believe they all suck at making ramen.. It's ramen yet they said I don't like the water in it and it looked like a flood got to it..wtf?! It's ramen!! Noodles and broth!!!! How dumb can you be? Ok maybe not dumb but they're acting like they invented ramen and it's supposed to be the exact opposite of what it actually is..
She better stick to neuroscience lmao
“I’m pretty sure this is gonna win! 😃”  Marcus: This shit dry as hell 😭
let's go
I mean, if they really "brought it in" from home, like made it earlier, let it sit in their car for an hour and microwaved it again. Yeah I'm not surprised they all suck? Lol. The soupless noodles would get drier and the soup noodles would turn to mush. You gotta eat it as soon as its served, not put tin foil on it and hope for the best later lol.
That boy got a lil sugar in his tank
Bruh where is the broth at they just made fried noodles not ramen
How you gonna serve dry ramen after hyping yourself up
Am I the only one who felt that they were kinda rude in their criticism? 🤔Like come on people, it is possible to give constructive feedback without needing to say things like “it looks like it came from the sides of the streets” or things like that
girl:call ever ones ramen nasty   also girl:gets wrost rateing
wheres the broth!?!?!
Bruh ramen has soup
Olu gives the "I'm not like other girls" vibe nil lol
Oluwamayowa had cultural Ramen so I think its unfair for the others to say stuff about it like that but also I think all the ratings were off
I’m sorry the first girl is not giving vibes 😂
They called the soup “water”
The most critical one.. got a 2 whit that dry clumpy ramen 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ some ppl an they nerve!
The girl in the cheetah print talked a big game for someone who had the nastiest looking ramen I've ever seen... Looks like it's been left in the sun
You shouldn’t be hearing a crunch when eating ramen wth.
I watched this to get myself through really fucking spicy ramen
Oul and Marcus are so unnecessarily negative 😭
america failed me again
Honestly I never thought u could go wrong with ramen…
They dont have money yet they put from $10-$15 worth of ingredients in their ramen
“My mom Is Spanish “ what ?
Would you like to accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior?
These are acting right cuz if their personality is this omg eewww
And all uh sudden I think I make some pretty frickin good ramen 💪😤🍜   WHY WAS Y'ALLS SO DRY 😭😩
Who tf be eating dry ass ramen with no broth
tf kinda ramen did they cook. wheres the soup
Remen to save the day 💀
5:38 - you mean something like a inedible piece of shit in a bowl that's been left in the bowl for 6 days
what bothers me most is that theyre using spoons
5:35 "i prefer my ramen a little bit dry" we've noticed
Would you call noodles pasta or pasta noodles      Me just trying to cause drama
I make good romen 😭 🍜
These are noodles not ramen
This guy looks like that character from Jimmy neutron!!!!
They keep saying it’s too much water… dude it’s frickin soup. It’s called ✨broth✨
As a new freshman, this video hit different.
WHERES THE BROTH?!?!!???!!!
3:04 girl. no kidding
“it’s salty” “the only thing with flavor is the chicken”
I wanted to see the cheetah girls reaction to losing lmao
Please, just cook a normal ramen 🤗☺️
Ramen is soup...like it's supposed to have water...
If your struggling you ain’t got that shrimp money
😂 i lowkey feel bad for that rude girl
They're eating ramen with SPOONS?
What type of ramen y’all making. Cause what was y’all thinking. Ramen is supposed to have broth🤦🏽‍♀️
Lawrys is salty as hell, lol. I prefer Season All.
Honestly they’re saying that the girl with the water in the ramen was strange but traditional ramen is literally 60% water 40% noodles lol
I gotta say who eats ramen dry like I have a flood of water and I understand  why she won she was actually not rude to :)
When she said I like my noodles a little more dry 😂😂😂 who else lost it?
My step dad’s African they got some of the worst most BS taste buds behind Chinese people
The problem is these contestants come with a "nothings gonna beat mine vibe"  People should come in trying to show off their dish but at least open to a new experience  That's why you're allowed to put your own spin into all these dishes, cuz no one is gonna make it exactly like yours
Why does withe people more beutiful than black people?
im— they dont like water on ramen? RAMEN IS LITERALLY SOUP😭💀 I MEAN IF SOME JAPANESE PPL (or any asia with ramen)OR ANY RAMEN LOVERS SEES THIS DRY ASS RAMEN THEYLL BE TRIGGERED AF😭😭😭
Trolling right?
I like my Ramen overcooked with a little water
The last one knew what was a ramen. The other two ...wtf. I can make a more EDIBLE AND TASTY ramen with few ingredients and BROTH than these people. 😂 Does anyone know what is RICO POLLO? that saves the day.
Nice
Omg … Americans do not know how to eat proper ramen. Drink the broth with the noodles.
Ramen is literally supposed to have soup wtf r they on ab LMAO
My nigerian people ooh Why you gotta put crayfish in everything🤣😂😂😂😂
They say they broke but can afford shrimp👀
How to make ramen good 101: add frozen veggies idek it just adds so much (sometimes i thinly slice some frozen chicken tenders too)
Wait, do ppl don't eat their ramen as soup? Like the first two (esp the 2nd) are dry af
olu is so biased its actually annoying
I’d be embarrassed if I was the cheetah print chick lmao
Mate mate ramen aint supposed to be drier than your grandmas skin also leopard skin sweater is just like they never ate package ramen or looked at the ingredients also do they under what ramen is and that it needs broth like the one with the water is literally the closest to ramen out of all of theirs yet is still so far to ramen like the only thing that makes them ramen is the noodles
they all looked disgusting
I don't get it. They broke but eat ramen with supposedly expensive animals in it. Instead you could buy fruits eg. There's much wrong in this worlds.
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
We know you prefer your ramen dry. Her face when she tasted the ramen said it all. That food was good and she ain’t wanna say it.
all these mfs annoying except the girl w the black shirt 🙄
the one who talks the most shit loses
Y'all really gave them fucking spoons.
what happened to broth and soy sauce or something
These people dumb 😂
It's *college* Ramen. One shrimp per bowl is what you get! She added oyster sauce. Me in college? How the hell would I have afforded that?! Lol! Of course, she won!
Hello where is the fork
“aRe YoU tRYinG tO kiLl mE🥺”
Why is there no soup in the ramen tho
I feel bad there broke
Ramen needs broth? This is just cold noodles lol
spoon?
Bro the Cheatsh girl hype her so much
“Broke” college kids don’t put shrimp in their ramen.. but go off
Even my two year old eats her SOUP with water🙄
as a broke college student, food = food idc bro LMAO
How hard is it to make instant ramen 😩there are so many ramen hacks available
Wait wait wait cheetah girl said everyone’s was flavorless but she likes dry ramen. Ramens main flavor comes from the broth
Cheetah girl was hyping up her ramen so much and doesn’t even know how to even make it
Me me me me
I hate it when they said it’s too watery dumbass there’s suppose to be broth in there tf
Too watery? You like it dry? Do you fools even know what Ramen is?
She made her sht in separate blocks of ramen😭
Shawty put one shrimp per bowl 😂😂😂
All these kids SUCK
The folks who flex the hardest, always get the lowest scores. They be on super 🧢 time… 😂😂😂
Y'all called that ramen lmao💀 Cheyenne's ramen is close to what I eat when it comes to ramen. It has to be "flood" because they're more flavourful unless you eat fried ramen, that's another story.
Idk why all of their ramens looked so unpleasing and it's not about being broke or anything the ramen looks so soggy and overcooked and its in the middle range where its neither soupy nor dry it just looks really bad. There's obviously no colour plus the proportions are so messed up, the crew should've provided a deep dish plate or a proper ramen bowl. Idk Im probably exaggerating but those are the worst looking noodles I've ever seen.
Bruh I’m a ramen connoisseur and all their ramens looked sooo Dookey 💀
“Why is this ramen so watery?” Girl that’s the only ramen made right 😭
They need to be taught how to cook ramen properly 😂😂 jk jk you do you boo! 🔥
the most annoying one always got the worst dishes in these vids lmaooo
I learned from my dad to put peanut butter in ramen. Not a lot just some. I thought it was really weird at first and would gag whenever he made it because I thought ramen and peanut butter would be disgusting. But then I tried it and the texture and sweetness of the peanut butter is gone it adds a fullness to the broth and makes it very similar to Pad Thai when you add sriracha.
Ramen is SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH BRUH
I can beat them all
olu : “it’s just dry..”  olu : “I would perfer my ramen a bit dry”
“Broke collage kids”😂😂
How are all 3 of these mofos so bad at cooking ramen noodles
Is everyone gonna ignore the fact that they were using spoons for ramen lol
RAMEN IS RAMEN EAT IT OR YEET IT
Y’all ruined amazing video, you guys had only one important job, to expose who made which one and how many points each one got.
Me being asian and confused af cuz where the hell did the broth go.. Come on now😭.
ramen is better with a broth omg?!! I ain't never tried dry ass ramen lmao. Try pancit canton if you don't want noodles with soup.
if yall dont like water in your ramen, just try pancit canton or something.
They're the most judgmental people I ever know and that stupid as hell
All these ramen really look sad
Spoiled rich kids…
Absolutely love how the girl that was boasting about her ramen the most and was so confident she was gonna win got the lowest score
Why are they eating with a spoon 🙂
who eats ramen with a spoon wtf💀
All of their ramen looks dry af and not struggled😂😂😂 Like where’s the juice??? They must be born after 92
Why is the cheetah print girl's noodles so clumpy like in chunks?....
I’m a simple dude I like my Ramen with butter and Parmesan
I kind of feel sorry for olu
Not the mags saying there’s too much water…. Ramen is suppose to have broth in it!!😭😭
I need my girl in the cheetah print to head on back to Nigeria bc who the hell taught you to put CRAYFISH in INSTANT RAMEN-
bruhs probably confused ramen with noodles or som pancit canton
Bitch Ramen needs soup 🍲 😩 ya'll western people scare me
Who tf eats dry ass ramen your suppose to have broth these fucking uncultured swine si fucking dislike people who remove the broth From the ramen 🍜
That is probably the worst cooking related video I’ve ever watched
Naruto eats more ramen
Judging these comments I predict the boy will win and I haven’t even finished the video 😂😂😂
That’s not broke. man I’d eat crushed ramen with the little packet with it and eat it dry
“it doesn’t have enough color” woman u literally just crushed up dry ramen and put it in a bowl😐
nah cause its the title for me "broke college kids" LMFAOAOA
When she said oyster sauce and sriracha I knew that she gonna win, atleast somethin in it that is actually asian. But I guess ramen cooked after instructions with a little roasted sesame oil and chives and maybe a block of tofu is buzzin already. Or If u have togarashi and rayu
It would be good on a thing like this to have one fake, who is a real chef or say like one of the broke asian students below who posted with really awesome recipe ideas - like the korean cheese kimchi one. Like one who is obviously doing something awesome and the rest or just reg cooks or students or grammas or whatever.
uhm. ramen has broth.
a two?!?! wow
People will always try to say that their stuff is better than others no matter what.
this was painful to watch
the girl w the braids ramen was literally the only one cooked and made properly and tasted good yet they still wanted something to say abt it😐
It’s BROTH not water.
It’s BROTH not water.
WHY DOES NOBODY EAT RAMEN WITH THE BROTH ITS THE BEST PART
I love how the guy has not heard of broth
why eating ramen w a spoon 🤨
they all looked bad, like there’s literally no water/broth 🤨
how are they going to talk about the most ramen-ish ramen like it's weird...... it's an asian dish, with siracha, hoisin- etc.... whack opinions
No no and no lol
“It has no colour” GWORL- did you see yours
America at its finest „WHY DOES IT HAVE WATER??“ its literally noodle soup😭🤣
Y’all are broke stop complaining lol 😂
I don’t even know how people can fuck up ramen that bad
I definitely make da best cheap ramen ever lol
Lol all these people saying there’s too much water 😂 do you even know what ramen is!? The broth is like the most important part 👏🏼! These people are picky as all hell 😂
HELP MEEEEE "look its a cLUMP🤨" 3:16
This ain't ramen
Why are they using a spoon for noodles bruh😭
Wow she’s stuck up and super judgmental.
Do they know what ramen is?
“My ramen has the most flavor” everyone: Why is there so many chunks in it🤣
Pot noodle with soy sauce siracha and sweat corn
Tufff they should of reacted to the scores
Why are they eating with a spoon??
When did broke college students get so picky with food…  count your blessings homies….
Wtf is that cuz none of those are ramen, ramen has broth
Who eats dry ramen? Even indomie needs a little water
My fave college noodles were Mi Goreng. With a fuck ton of fried eggs.
“I like the ramen dry” yeah, just like you..
Why are their ramens dry? Plus why are there no asian contestants?
OLU BE LIKE ITS NO COLOR WDYM RAMEN IS NKT RED
Olu: ITS TOO SALTY Me:bruh ramens always salty do you expect it to be sweet?
Ion mean to be rude, but Cheetah girl doing the most. Calm down miss arrogance lmao Not her saying "It has water in it" like what ? haha
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon
The broth is the best I like to drink it after don't ask why and it the noodles flavor
obviously it’s gonna look bad. it’s packaged ramen with just powder and you add water 🤦‍♀️ but god, who doesn’t keep the broth. they’re crazy. i usually just add a slice of cheese and soft boiled eggs lol
Wheres the broth and it better be hot and fresh. Everyone knows sitting Ramen gets mushy lol
4:15 “they went wrong by waking up and decide to make it” 😂😂😂😂 damnnnn
i just eat it the dry block and call it a day
who gave them spoons to eat ramen
Confidence - it's food for the wise, but liquor for a fool
"This is too watery." It's a soup, that's why they gave you a spoon! lol
I would add red pepper flakes and a generous amount of tajin.
Well majority of black people drain out most of the water and add a lil bit of butter. But as we got older and more aware of Japanese culture we realize the importance of broth! Anime for the win
All those look like booty. No broth, no egg, no veg. Wtf yall doing
It's not hard to make good Ramen...especially if you love your carbs.I mean you can add scrambled eggs to it to make bomb Ramen.
The fact that many americans can’t understand the difference between cooking and eating ethnic food properly and their personal preferences on a certain dish says a lot. Yes you it ramen with chopsticks/fork & a spoon (better if it is the renge spoon). Ramen HAS broth. That’s it. *unrelated note: hardshell tacos are not a real thing and are nasty af
My Roman has so much juice....u gotta spoon for 10 minutes to see the noodles💯
They don't look like they used to be broke to me, that's first. Second, why tf are y'all mad at the broth? You don't eat ramen dry!!! I'm also a bit surprised she used shrimp in a supposed to be struggle ramen coz it's really expensive where I live, maybe not where she does?? If this is broke, I'm already feeling bad for my extra spicy ramen to just give it a taste with a bag of chips on a good day🚶🏾‍♂️
In logo ko koi maggi khilao
I seen better Ramen meals in prison lmao. This is sad.
I love watery ramen tho cause the seasoning actually you can taste it and it’s not dry 🤷🏽‍♀️
“It has too much water” you mean the BROTH that makes Ramen RAMEN???? 🤣 gtfo
All that ramen looked gross.
to  be honest none of these ramen look good...
Personal struggle Ramen recipe: -package of ramen -beef jerky  -green onions -peanut butter -optional seasonings/toppings  Step one: Soak beef jerky for a minute, so you don't feel like you're chewing on an old boot. (Warning: Don't use slim jims, because they're ass, and you'll hate yourself for the attempt.)  Step 2: Once the jerky is a bit soft, shred it and put it in a bowl with the noodle block. Add enough water to steam the noodles and make the jerky tender.  Step 3: Add a teaspoon of peanut butter (weird, I know) to help everything adhere. Add seasoning packet.  Step three: Top with green onions. Add anything else you may desire. Soy sauce from that one time you ordered take-out, Sriracha that you borrowed from your roommate, more green onions because they're hella cheap (seriously, two bundles for a dollar)  and you can regrow the tops if you put them in a glass of water.  Step 4: Enjoy while watching Netflix. How can you afford Netflix? You can't, you stole the password from your parents.
WATER GUYS COME ON SHE PUT THE BROTH WHICH IS AMAZING
they clearly have never had ramen in their entire life bro, like-
a good way to improve ramen is to add butter, a small dash of milk, veggies, salt, garlic salt, garlic powder, pepper, sage, boiled eggs and the meat type that the ramen is trying to taste like
so we just aint gonna talk about the fact that there all eating ramen with a spoon ?
Clearly these kids don’t come from “broke “ ..too boujee of opinions for me.we eat ramen diff ways cuz we have to eat it so much.
5:37 oh we know you like it dry😂
Why didn’t they keep the broth? Ramen is supposed to have broth
The only thing I was able to think of while watching this was:  *Where's the broth?*
Ramen has soup people
Ramen....is a soup? What do you mean 'I prefer mine dry' it's just fucking noodles then. Cronch Cronch
if theres no broth its an L from me! no thanks to dry ramen
If they wanted dry ramen they shouldve just gotten pancit canton which is meant to be served without broth lool
"It has water in it" bro ITS RAMEN
I hate dry ramen like??????just me lol
Goes to restaurant Waiter: what can I get for you? These people: ramen but can you take the water out so it’s just noodles
I mean ramen includes water
“Remen”
College students who don't know how to cook are so fucking annoying. I don't trust their input on any sort of food.
Why they using spoons
Ramen /noodles are suppose to be eaten instantly (stays in the broth for too long = 🤢---- no broth = dry af)
Yaw really out here eating dry ramen 😭
Idk what rock ive been living under, but the only way I eat noodles is with the juice. Yall are weird with that dry noodle stuff
Their ramens were so dry wth
Cheetah girl did to much her attitude was nasty and so was her noodles
Is she broke when she can buy shrimp?, Dman she must be getting cash another way 🧐
They’re all so pretty- god definitely picked his favourites lmao.
The cheetah print girl is literally my worst nightmare, I avoid people like this at all costs lmao.
You’re not a broke college student unless you’re eating ramen straight ramen without anything at all
It’s litterally a fucking soup if you eat it without water you’re doing it wrong
So much critique, and its just Ramen. 😅😅😅
Olu seems like one of those women who wonders why she's single.🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅
Broth + Ramen = ❤, so glad I found ways to make food better. I use to eat my Ramen like this. If there is no slurp action going you doing it wrong.
Only the winner's ramen is the closest to what we call a ramen
“They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it” oh myyy😂😂😂
Spaghetti hair got that alter ego going on
That saltine reference was savage 😅
Isn't ramen supposed to have liquid? Sounded like it would taste of ocean though.
College is broke? Try jail style way better than these
Lol do the 1st 2 even know what ramen is 🤣🤣🤣
Ok but why y'all using a spoon, or is that sum people do cuz I'm confused ✋🏿👁️👄.
Ramen is supposed to be in a broth so I'm wondering why they complaining about the "water"
I  would kill this contest
Throw away the packet, use the noodles. Mix some soy sauce, peanut butter, garlic together with the noodles. Throw some veggies and some crushed peanuts. PAD THAI.
Broke....pays for parking...wow
They suck at this
“I don’t like all the water in this ramen” hurts my Asian heart
So you're telling me they be eating ramen with A SPOON??
Wtf they just cant cook
This whole video is pissing me off 😭😭😭😭😭😭
That's fckd up how as students, they had to pay for parking at school!
yall just had to "broke " in there
the title 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you sauté some mushrooms with pickled red onions and pickled chives in some grass fed butter and pour it over your ramen with the broth in it. It’s next level Ramen!   You can pickle your own stuff too just by doing equal parts water and vinegar with a pinch of salt ( I also add a tablespoon of sugar but you don’t need too ).  That way you can just grab stuff when you need it!   Another thing you can do if you don’t like a lot of broth is blend in some avocado and roasted peanuts with oyster sauce and fish sauce as well. And some shrimp or chicken. I prefer ramen with broth but when you do peanuts it does seem to taste better a little more dry. Depends on how you like it! Add a fried egg on top! Just go crazy! 😆
2:06 “it’s salty” Bro that’s literally what ramen is. Salt and noodles
Black people eating ramen and complaining there's soup in it TF?!
She can’t even pronounce ramen right she forsure never struggled
i am still waiting for them to serve some ramen? maybe in next episode?   This is noodle water at best (soy sauce, ginger, garlic, miso, mirin, egg = all cheap).
Ramon is supposed to be wet
I wouldve won this for sure 😂
shocks me that none of them had any broth with their noodles
It’s ramen it suppose to be watery
Bro that girl was pissing me off … because she was judging everyone 😀 like stfu no one’s perfect
the Nigerian girl just wants to brag about her "spices". go on brag, no one cares.
WHERE IS THE BROTH 💀😭
"it's too dry." 5 seconds later "i'd prefer my ramen more dry."
olamanma was not it
They are complaining about the broth of the ramen...... .-.? The 2nd one was clumps of starch and flour with seasonings.... I feel like they are being SO critical of anyone elses ramen tho x.x
This girl really out here judging them like Gordon Ramsey
Y la cheyenne apa?
Do they not know that ramen is a SOUP! I Mean it’s cringey to watch. Especially cheetah girl with her bricks
As an Asian I hate how all of them lack broth.
the girl in cheetah print kinda a bitch

the afro girl just think she so cool and hated on the first one bc she wanna win
this whole video is a crime
"I'll perfer my ramen more dry".... Yea sis we already know 💀

"we have remen to save the day" 😭
See how the nicest person always wins. 😘
Don’t bring cheetah print back
okay first of all why r they eating ramen with a mf spoon
"The water" Nigga please
College is basically a huge scam. No reason why parking and books have to be so expensive. This covid thing was probably the best thing ever since no more in person classes. no more parking.
its sad
0:44 "Remen"
He just roasted them
Lol broke
they were judging the broth in the ramen but don’t they know ramen is a soup?
I came here for recipes but left rolling on the floor😂
Why did I run to the comment section 😂😂
Why don't any of them have soup in the ramen?
not them saying the wet one is “too wet” bruh the other ones looks dry af shit i needed water after seeing those other two 💀💀💀
The one girl who said oh this is dry! Well MY Ramon…. Then hers was the Sahara desert
"Broke" is crazy LMFAOOO
2:16 where is the flavor in this? 2:15 *the flavor is immaculate.*
They need to be served restaurant quality ramen, so I can hear the shit they'll be talking about it.
I ain’t gonna lie… I hate that so many black people try to make ramen pasta. It’s soup. Literally
Who likes really dry Ramen? I dont like it too watery either, but dry is worse.
i live for cheyenne lol
Sick of these naijans. Always cocky with the least amount of skills.
DRY RAMEN?! RAMEN COMES IN BROTH! CULTURAL INAPPROPRIATION!!!!!
I can’t put through out the whole thing because it’s a collage student on a budget lol she killed it
AINT NO WAY PEOPLE ACTUALY EAT RAMEN DRY WTFFF
Who tf doesn't fill up the entire bowl with water, get that broth bruh
Me the whole time: why the flip flop are they using a spoon with ramen
First: don’t eat it without the broth Second: not a spoon
2:01 like she didn’t Drench hers in spices
He said I don’t like all that water no offense but this man has no taste buds
You’re supposed to have water in the ramen because that’s the broth
Kuz they ain’t getting the good ramen
Am I the only who keeps the water in with my Ramen to drink the broth after wards  ?
pls bring them to japan
Where is the broth?????
Asian college kids looking at these ramen in horror 😂
Uh uh Cheyenne you go girl cuz what was they talking bout 💀
idk how they can fuck up seasonings like isn’t it from the soup base packet 😭😭 how bad are they at making this ajahskshsjz
Honestly my way of eating it better than all three of theirs just add a dash of soy sauce after following the instructions
Ramen comes with packets and instructions these goobers were like nah ima make it worse
i mean ig u can eat ramen with a spooon but like why not a fork or chapsticks
If you just get some flour, water, salt, and sugar you can make some bread that will fill you up
Did any of them even put the broth in the ramen???????
why are they using spoons 😭😭😭
But ramen is soup??
4:26 that's why I won't say anything about your eyebrows.
Why do they all have to be black? Incentivating stereotypes
The cheetah print girl is so pretty omg
i didn’t realize how pretentious some people could be over ramen.
She’s eating the ramen with a spoon
Ramen is supposed to have broth what the heck are they on about? 😭✋
Ramen, in traditional version from Japan, is a broth noodle dish…
Bro like how they complainig about the ramen of cheyenne has water in it. Like you dumb dumb? 😂 Rames 👏🏽 supposed 👏🏽 to 👏🏽 have 👏🏽 water 👏🏽 in 👏🏽 it 👏🏽!!!!!! That told me they NEVER eat traditional ramen. Ramen is in a broth made out of 90% water my guy. Like fr? 😂 my asian heart is bleeding. 😩😂
Just a reminder Jesus loves you all. No matter what you have done then or now. You aren't seeing this in coincidence. God has chosen you to be part of his kingdom to become a citizen of his kingdom. He wants a relationship with you. We’re all sinners who rebelled against a holy God and is punishable by eternity in hell but through God grace we are saved through Jesus who died and rose from the dead, and paid for our sins so forgot about you past mistakes come to Jesus as you are. Who is loving a willingly forgiving. Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. Hope you all have a wonderful night, God bless all.
5:39 "id prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" yeah we saw 😅
I’m in culinary school and In my opinion the best ramen has chili sauces steak and fried eggs
In sorry but isn't ramen supposed to have broth
NOBODY AND I MEAN NOBODY wants dry ramen olu and marcus are weird nobody wants ramen thats drier than the desert we need water and flavor
this video has meme potential, with yk the girl the that was hyping up her ramen, and then it being the worst one
How are y’all eating that without the broth? You gotta keep the spices, and hot soup my guy
The first time I ever ate ramen noodles was in the 70s while on vacation in Hawaii Theye were not served with liquid or as a soup. We feel in love with them they were hard to find in the state I live in and hadn't caught on yet but we would order them because they were so good.  We would drain the liguid off then relax them in cold water to stop the cooking  and add the seasoning, sesame oil, garlic, oyster sauce and garlic chili sauce like they did in Hawaii. My grandkids tell me I am doing it wrong.
Ramens not supposed to have clumps. Its literally soup and noodles why would it have chunks I know you can eat it uncooked but nobody actually enjoys it.
When I cook ramen its maruchan chicken flavor and I add either red chilly flakes or if im feeling spicy pun intended ill add something not so spicy as franks red hot to something as spicy as grinders death sauce then I add shredded cheese
Afro sk@nk wack asffffff
who doesn't eat ramen with broth wtf
all of these look rancid
“It has water i guess” please do not tell me she just called the soup water
I think it's natural to be a broke college student these days
for broke people they have some really strong opinions for how ramen should be made 😭 I make mine like how the package says
Why is olu  the most annoying one out of all of them she said she had the best ramen and she got the lowest rate lol
Are they eating Ramen with a spoon.TRIGGER
all of these suck
When I used to live in Cali everyone at my elementary school ate ramen noodles raw . They told me to try it lol . It was good af lol so when I got to college when I didn’t have a microwave I would just eat the noodles raw lol
"Its a little watery I prefer mine a bit dry"  Honey your ramen looked like Lego bricks
Please get people that actually know how to cook ramen😭. They like its watery . Do they know what is ramen
There girl that is talking to much smack (the girl that Nigerian) is the worst contestants BECUASE SHES latterly talking smack and hers was the worst
Wait she’s in collage “my mom is Spanish” bro my mom is Mexican U NEEX TO SAY THATTT
Olu look like a female lil nas x 💀.
All of them talking about the “water” like what do you think ramen is?-
NOT OLU GETTING A 2 PLSS
is there something in the water over there? imagine making ramen dry… gurl
Maybe I'm wrong but I always thought ramen was a noodle "soup" dish?
she’s saying remen??
Paying for books, lol
So funny idk Man I just feel like there was to much going on I just get the ramen packets and I’m done with the day
I love this but I make the best ramen noodles
Dry ramen must be a new thing I’m 26 and growing up I only got ramen when I was sick and I loved it my mom called it “Noodley soup” she would always give me more broth then ramen when I was sick and sometimes added vegetables, but I had no idea it was called ramen for years 😂
“I prefer my Ramen more dry” IT SHOULD NEEEVER BE DRY WTF😂
There all black
Ground meat, taco seasoning and cheese.  Awesome.
Just cook the instant raman, with chili oil  eggs, fking chicken or 1 dollar susages
....do they not know ramen is a soup based dish??? Dry ramen is not how it's supposed to be.
what is this cringe
Guys, water is free...Generally lol... scallions,  ajitsuke tamago egg, frozen/fresh veggies... mushrooms... dumpling. BAM
That girl really thought she ate
"it has water in it" water?  you mean BROTH?
Now c’mon olu🤣
they just hating each others ramen man
What do ya mean watery it's called ramen soup You don't have to have a whole bowl full of liquid every time but it shouldn't be bone dry either
recipe for good asf ramen :  maruchen ramen,  pour 1/3 of it out {or not if you like it } put bits of slim jim beef, add some lime juice and some salsa valentina , with some fried pork skins chips.
The three were awful, Ramen is not dry.  A Simple ramen soup will be:  Ramen bag (with its seasoning, I like chicken). Green onion An egg  And that's it I really good and cheap soup
love one another, as God loves you. -- John 15:12
tf they complaining about water for, ramen is a SOUP 🍜
Is it normal to eat Ramen with a spoon ?
It needs more color, girl you can’t taste color and presentation only lasts for thirty seconds it’s the flavor that get you to like it, stop talking about color 🙏🏻
All of their ramens look dry especially the cheetah print girl💀
Personally like my ramen with water in it. So I would prefer her own
If your broke you don’t dress that well 😂
Where is the egg, butter, cheese & some green onion ramen or maybe just a regular ramen with the broth & packet flavor would’ve beat all these lol
The fact that the cheetah print girl had so much talk but nothing to show for it she can't even say ramen probably! =]
The only one that came close to how ramen is SUPPOSED to taste is the last that won. She put  Asian sauces in it. I would suggest adding bulgogi, rice cake, mushrooms, an over-easy egg, fresh cilantro, bean sprouts or something extra like that. It instantly takes ramen up a notch.
Olu: I prefer my ramen a lil more dry. Us: We KNOW sis.
Only one girl did ramen. The two? Are those supposed to be yakisoba? Idk.
first of all, none of them know how to make ramen wtf is this
I understand maruchan ramen is the ramen outside of asia, and that's fine idc about that but like....how do u eat ramen noodle SOUP without broth??
Wait what who doesn’t use broth— I DIDNT KNOW NOT USING BROTHER WAS THING—— ima taste it without broth tho
But, ramen is MEANT to have the broth. The broth is the best part lol.  Glad the rude girl got the lowest rating. She was straight hating.
How tf do these people make Ramen if Cheyenne’s ramen is “watery”. Isn’t that how you make ramen, you cook it with water and add the seasoning 💀💀💀💀💀
You lot need to start showing the losers reactions when they find out their score and the reactions of the other contestants 😂
Man put me on here lol
"I prefer my ramen dry" I CAN TELL!
You need water nahhhh 😭😭 help they have no idea I bet it was good
No Fr I can’t with these 💀🙏🏽
The cheetah shirt Girl Has disgraced my country 😭😭😭 she can't cook for shii 😭
I ain’t gon hold you, all their ramen looked kinda… not good LOL.  Broke people don’t have chicken or shrimp to add 🤣
Lmao seeing these westerners murdering ramen is so disheartening but also funny 😆 what do you mean I prefer dry ramen it is supposed to be soupy
“The ramen is too watery” 💀💀
none of them know how to make ramen
"I would prefer my ramen a little dry" -girl with the driest ramen to ever exist.
Olu: the ramen is watery, i like mine dry  Ramen is a soup it's not supposed to be a stew!
I like my ramen with water…..👀
The guy said nasty and he added chicken to the ramen
as an asian person this is remotely offending
NAUR CAUSE ALL THEY RAMEN BE DISGUSTANGGG
i would love to see the reactions of there ratings 💀🤣🤣
1:40 “muh-ROO-chin”
ramen is literally broth and noodles.. it’s basically soup so it’s supposed to be WATERY 💀
Ramen with spoon ?
The person being the rudest is always the one with the worst things
THE RAMEN MATERS
Is no one gonna point out they look like the same person
where's the soup
UCR girlie let us downnn sdkfljdglkrj
Idk how people eat noodles with no broth I hate dry a$$ noodles
“its salty like are you trying to kill me?”  “season the ramen the ramen matters”  what
What they eatin ain’t ramen  it’s just noodles 😀
all their noodles look nasty af
I love how the cheetah girl said for the Raman with alot of water "let me just add some of my  spices so I can give it color" I'?  LIKE GIRL EVERYONE HATED YOUR RAMA LEARN TO COOK AND SHE SAID IT WAS TO WET AND SHE LIKES HERS DRY
I do the beef ramen packet  Pot boiled then drain then put into a pan with butter Cayenne pepper  slap ya mamas Cajun seasoning. Mix with the noodles. crack an egg directly onto the pan. then top it off with sriracha sauce.
They all doing way to much and to energetic to try ramen💀
I actually don’t like a ton of broth with my ramen so I drain it afterwards. 😂 when i make it for my friends though I keep it in because I know I am in the minority 😂
"Its so watery" "it looks flooded" bruh Ramen is a soup it's literally broth 💀💀
Yo I find it hilarious that I would used to see Ramen being made by other people (not gonna lie it was almost always white and asian), and they always dumped the flavoring in the liquid, I thought that it was me being hella ghetto tryna get all that flavoring by just dumping it on nothing but the noodles, but seeing two of these people complain about there being liquid made realize that I didn't have weird food habits, I was just being a nigga and everyone else eat them bitches like that too 😭💀
Ms Cheetah print is DEFINITELY an acquired taste 😭😖
Homegirl with the Cheetah print would be better off skipping this video and not reading the comments cuz she'd seem like she'd have a bad day after coming to this video 😭💀
BOOOORINGG
Miss Nigeria really said “my ramen the best ramen” and STILL didn’t manage to win. 💀💀💀
the cheetah print girl is a spoiled bt3 and sped
Kinda Racist
I hate the cheetah girl
WHY EATING RAMEN W SPOON
Calling the last girl's noodles "slimy" was disrespectful to the noodles, it's called BROTH. And noodles are originally meant to be with broth instead of being dry as hell.
as an asian person i dont think their recipes couldve been worse … 😭😭
Go to a ramen place and they will literally serve it with broth . Like are y’all gon ask them to take the broth out?
Olu: “I’d prefer my ramen a bit more dry…” Also her: *dry ramen ball*
RAMEN IS A SOUP WHAT THE HELL UNCULTURED
My Raman is shin ramen with cheese egg and seaweed and ginger which. Is weird but bomb
I can’t, because it’s a struggle meal where did you get the shrimp 😂😂 shrimp is not cheap, chicken I can kinda see.
Cheeta print was using expensive ingredients, shrimp is expensive
I thought this would be fun and helpful to improve on my ramen recipe, but honestly I just learned a bunch of what not to do. Can't believe no one added peanut butter or a soft boiled egg and in disbelief people criticized the broth!
dry ramen??? ewwww I love some brothy ramen ☹️
None of you have any respect for Ramen. This video was trash. 1 egg - slice of cheese- green onions- grated garlic. Boom. 🤦‍♂️
I feel like they expect the ramen to be like top notch gourmet and forget its a struggle meal
“I don’t like it its to watery” girl yours is straight up built like a lump of coal 😆😂
They did noodoles and called it ramen
I make my ramen by getting a bowl big enough for it to fit, I open the packet, put it in the bowl, fill it with enough water that the ramen starts to float, put it in the microwave for 5 minutes and 30 seconds, when that’s done I pour out most of the water (I leave a small bit left) then, I put the flavor packet in that it comes with, complete seasoning and onion powder, stir it, then I put 1 or 2 ice cubes and i eat it🤷🏽‍♀️ I get the beef ramen
That ain’t even ramen all 3
the one who hyped her ramen up got the lowest rates💀
I know I've been out of school for a long time, but when did dry ass ramen become a thing? Of course the girl with the broth won, that's literally how it's supposed to be made. I loved that he said more shrimp. When I was in college all we were adding was hot sauce, hopes, and dreams. An egg if you were feeling fancy and rich.
There's no such thing as too much broth what
lol, “broke”
4:41 NAH CUZ WHY THE DISRESPECT 😭
Those two girls are so gorgeous looking
Do people not eat their ramen with broth??? Like I am so confused the comments about the last one with "water"
They should just buy cup ramen..I feel attacked as an asian🤣🤣 btw the last one seems ok to me
These people don’t know shit about flavor; you can use cheap ingredients and make a fantastic instant noodle.
One girl really said “ my moms Spanish “ smh 🤦‍♀️
She wants to add “Atatatgoon” to everything 💀
THEYRE EATING WITH A SPOON AND TWO WERE WITHOUT THE WATER,THAT SHIT LOOKED DRY AF,ITS SOUP OBVIOUSLY IT HAS WATER😭😭😭😭😭😭
Y’all, I always have my Ramen with like a cup or more of the water and like it’s colored like it’s red and stuff because I have the packet I’m so confused have I’ve been living a lie?.??? But like all there’s looked gross and dry to me idk
Cheetha print girl looks goofy now
How are you gonna say the ramen got flooded? It's literally ramen. What college are they going to?
uh no one noticing that they are eating noodles with a spoon.
the guy reminds me of d’angelo wallace
Are they eating ramen with a spoon
the cheetah print girl: “i’d preferred my ramen a little bit more dry”  also cheetah print girl: complains about marcus' ramen being dry
They all gotta b trolling
Them: "Why is the ramen so watery??" - Ramen: a literal noodle soup dish.🙃
It's always the one who brags the most that finishes in last lmfaoo I love it here. Stay humble kids.
Bro they all got spoons they run out of forks?
She swear she a cook😂
It aint even Ramen without broth
Dude..I’m younger then these people and my ramen is literally just ramen like…first of all ramen has soup bro…like u make in dry noodles?
I don’t think any of them know what ramen is. Like I understand people from different areas make foods differently. But I big thing I don’t understand why they are eating ramen with a spoon. That’s what bothers me the most. 🤔😵‍💫
The girl in the cheats shirt her ramen looked nasty and they all said it way nasty L that what I get for being over confinement
Olu see your life. Chai
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen 😂
last one looks the best ngl
How can you mess up a ramen 🙃 it’s suppose to be a soup. I’m embarrassed
I can imagine the taste of these ramens just by knowing their ingredients. Idk if im the only weirdo that does that but if the Nigerian girl just cooked hers a bit more and was nicer those good seasonings she added woulda come out 🔥 Indomie with a bit of crayfish, maggi and scotch bonnet, diced onions and peppers.... And maybe fried egg on the side 😋😋
So when they go to a restaurant & order a broth-based ramen, do they tell the chef to pour out the broth?
The Asians are crying
The Afro girl was def a rich “model” frat girl lmao
"I'd prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" *sis has literally clumps in her own ramen"
Cheetah girl: I want my ramen dry Her ramen: ☀️🏜 How ramens' supposed to be: 🍜💦 Me: Getting triggered by the way they are eating ramen with a spoon.
“I don’t like all the water” … you mean BROTH?
“sorry to that man” LMAOOOO
Nah as a African that watches a lot of anime YOU KEEP THE BROTH 😌! And I add letter and slightly boiled egg.
The other two be saying the third contestants ramen is too wet and pale and stuff but taste good and i'm here wondering, isn't that what ramen is supposed to be like? On the other hand, why is your ramen so dry????
Y'all all this people don't like "water" with their ramen....   RAMEN IS NOODLE WITH BROTH 😭. You missin out
WHY DO THEY DISLIKE THE "WATER-Y" ONE?? THAT'S HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT ITT
You need the broth is the best part in your ramen or you might as well have a bowl of straw or wheat.
Always the one that have big mouths gets the lowest score, congratulations on your 2.
Cheyenne: So this is my ramen- Me: *You win. There’s broth. There’s shrimp. There’s seasoning. You win.*
Love that the one girl just put the others girls ramen on the table because it was dry as hell
A lot of Nigerians make ramen dry, and as a Nigerian, I hate it. Like I HATEEE it so much.
🤣”the ramen is watery” its ramen its not supposed to be dry
That shxt looks trash respectfully
This Is dry and crunchy 💀💀
This shit look dry asl 💀😭😭
I can't stop being mad at the fact that they be using spoons
Where is the damn best part of the ramen noodles …..the juice 💀💀
idk if you guys have seen ramen before
can I please not get hate for this-     *BUT WHO THE FUCK EATS RAMEN NOODLES WITH A SPOON? THESE THREE, THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHO EATS NOODLES WITH A SPOON? IT IS REQUIRED BY HUMAN NATURE THAT YOU USE A GOD DAMN FORK*   Again I mean no offense for this it just triggers me lol
She’s the only one whose ramen looked cooked and edible to me. 🤷🏾‍♀️
the struggle is real with these 💀
Even though i don't eat ramen since i'm an south east asian but this hurt my soul so damn much cause how are these ramens omg😭
But why are they all black ?
The girl with the afro is getting on my nerves💀
DUDE I MEAN DO THIS HUMANS KNOW HOW A RAMEN LOOKS LIKE?! *CRYES IN ASIAN* T-T
....why you giving them spoons when they're eating noodles -_-  "there's not enough shrimp"  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND SHRIMP IS EXPENSIVE lmao
The girl like her ramen as dry as af….
I could tell she was Finna lose just by the way she says ramen
Did they forget ramen is a soup not pasta
Where is the hot sauce? Where is the butter?
Bruh. Its ramen. Its suppose to be in a watery broth consistency. Its not like chow Mein or spaghettis.
Kids picky as hell for being broke
“It’s salty u tryna kill me?”
these people don’t know how to cook ramen 😭
This type of Ramen is post to have water in it if you’re not having  a water your Ramen you’re nasty ,foul ,disgusting . That’s why everybody accept the last person is getting a zero. Sorry not sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is this real?
Who watches this at 5:00 still awake when hungry
What type of people eat their ramen dry-
Y'all keep telling them to keep the broth, but some people really hate soup so I understand them completely. I always drain my ramen or eat yakisoba instead because I HATE SOUP SO MUCH IT CAN GO D1E IN A DITCH; SOUP IS THE WORST TRAGEDY EVER DONE BY HUMANITY RIGHT BEFORE WORLD WAR II
Bruh they always dislike the food if it isn’t theirs…
Ramen is soup! Omg no one can cook ramen except Cheyenne. How are y’all making ramen without broth?! Lol
Nothing gets my attention like a black women with a afro. Just so beautiful
What ramen y'all have been eating if that's too watery for u wtf
im sorry but all those ramen bowls looked, questionable. its a no from me.
Why are they eating ramen noodles with a spoon?
Should've been made in studio, ramen loses half its goodness after 10 minutes.
how can they mess up a fcking ramen
Y’all ramen is supposed to have broth 😭 no be dry as hell 💀
Im disappointed… they ate the ramen wit a spoon
That isnt even a ramen
The ppl complaining ab the ramen being "watery" make no sense do they not know what ramen is 💀
Do they know that ramen is suppose to have soup
just add boiling water and the spices that came w it, some of that spicy red powder (i forgot the name) some paprika and lemon salt (maybe some cheese) and boom good ramen  (before u say anything abt the broke part the spices will last a while bc they sell a lot in the smalliest bags yk so several bowls  w one bag of each of the spices i usually add can last like.... a month and theyre cheap)
Olu is biased 💀
Whats wrong with water on ramen omg 😂
Just keep a little water the girl in the cheetah print shit was dry asl
Why does she say ramen like that 💀🤣she deadass she changed the why she say it like three times
I appreciate that Olu tried to put her roots into her meal but, dude seafood is expensive. I meal if she was for real struggling she wouldn't be adding seafood to her ramen. She'd be using that money for books and shit
Bitch like your ramen had a color the fuck
get chicken noodles soup slap yo mama seasoning tajn lemon  red hot hot sus 😩🤌🏾
Tell me what's your favorite type ramen mine top ramen chicken flavor
5:38 yea we can tell
2:40 no bias there
Y no soup liquid of Ramen, but dry? That’s y it look not so much tasty, add liquid in it, that way it taste gd.
None of them know how to make noodles ✋😭
AY WHY THE YOU DISRESPECT RAW RAMEN ITS SO GOOD
i really dislike some of the people that do these videos they act like they are 5 star chefs
“It’s salty are u trying to kill me 😟” ITS RAMEN
I love how it’s always the nicest people who don’t try to hype up their food who always get the best scores
Ata gungun
Why they using SPOONS!!!
bruh ramen is supposed to have broth in it, wdym its too watery????
Nigeria🇳🇬
Man all these people suck at making ramen
"The ramen is a bit watery" Asian cameraman: You're dead mate! Don't hold me!...
me just using th packet it came with <3, i like my noodle texture hiw i make it tho, its fire
Where's the anime in this ramen 🥲
Where is the colour? Why are all the ramen naked? MY ANCESTORS ARE CRYING AND BEGGING ME TO FREE THEM FROM THIS CRISIS 😭😭😭😭😭
"watery" dawg its a SOUP
Bitch with the fro is the embodiment of 21st century college students. Holy shit I'd kms if I had to listen to her speak for more than 5 minutes
All they noodles looked nasty 💀💀
this video pisses me off on so many levels
she wanted to win so bad 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
The girl with the ponytail was actually giving good feedback and not just roasting it. I’m glad she won lol
I wanted to see the other peoples reaction😭
If you dont put some god damn broth is ur frikin ramen, you be eaten spaghetti
Who don’t like their ramen with broth???
olu and Marcus are literally so self esteemed. no wonder they were broke.
i may not have Asian ancestors but marcus and olu's ramen are making my culinary ancestors cry, turn in their graves, and swear vengeance from beyond.
you can tell these kids have never had decent ramen when they say its too watery. now cheyenne's, she can give that whole bowl to me cause from the description of the flavors, i know i will love it. great job cheyenne!
"they added chicken to it so that's a different spin" you haven't eaten ramen before have u and she was shocked there was "water" in it girl what
Imma be honest I really wanted to see the girl who lost reaction about them losing💀😂😂
I needed to see cheetah girl reaction to her’s being the worst…
ramen needs soup yes-💀
Its amazing that the scores never match the comments
Wow the black girl (not the one in the cheetah print) the other one with dreads. Damn… she fine asf I think I like black women now. Sorry great great granddaddy 🤣🤣
I’m just mad they’re eating ramen with spoons
As an asian ramen don't need any meat the taste of broth is important plus meat is way more expensive than seasoning (my eng is not that good)
🤦I am sorry but dry ramen ???  Ramen is supposed to be soupy... 🍜🍜 Like thats literally the best part when the soup has all the masala and flavours...  I mean i am a bit judgmental on dry ramen but if it works for u then great  🎉🎉.... It's just we have very different tastes like veryyyyy different!!!!
they should’ve chose broke students who actually KNOW how to cook.
The cheetah girl is nasty but it's fine, the other two are quite sweet so it balances out nicely.
Girl ramen supposedly to have water in them
olu honey we know you are a neuroscience major but there's no need to use your ramen to make brain models.
idk if this is a joke or naww😭💀
Say bruh don't look like dude off Jimmy neutron 🤣
"I prefer my Ramen a little bit more dry", that girl bad news, she a menace to society
Key to ramen is the Broth what r they saying too much water that wasn’t enough 👌🏼
Jesus, this is embarassing
Why is it only black people 🤔are you try tell us something……..
They woulda loved mine das all I can say
Please olu’s noodles looked nasty asf and she was kinda rude too this goes to show that karma is a bitch she deserved that 2 ☺️
Nigerians eat a ton of Indo Mie ramen.  They even have a special Indo Mie manufacturing plant in Nigeria.  Nigerians doctor Indo Mie a lot.
I know I wouldn’t get a bad rating on how I make my ramen if I was in this video lol I cook for 4 mins, drain most of the juice, put the seasoning, 2 over easy fried eggs, and Valentina
Why are they all black the hosts?
maybe if these kids spent as much time trying to make their food not look broke as much as they do themselves, they wouldn't have such pathetic looking meals to try act superior to each other with lol
cheetah girl noodles be like this: 🐪🏜☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️
5:39 o we  know
Theres so much wrong with the American instant ramen ima just put it here
The cheetah print girl so rude-
ramen is literally soup what is the cheetah print girl talking about💀
Everyone is so rude omg, this was hard to watch , I get it, be HONEST, give your honest opinion.. but Jesus, Marcus is weird, ramen is SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER 😭 and their was barely any water in their.
Gonna be honest chief, this is the first time I've seen anyobody eat ramen with a spoon
Who eats ramen with a spoon
GURL REALLY SAID IT LOOKED SPANISH LAMDJSHBDBDVD
omg im pretty even an 10 yo asian child can cook better ramen than them 💀
Me over hear just adding spice
Isn’t it suppose to be watery? I mean it’s Ramen. And Cheyenne cooked her noodles to long if its slimy
these college students really have been struggling alot. they don't even have enough water to put in the ramen and cook it...damn I feel so bad
"I don't like all the water" The definition of ramen: a noodle *soup*
not the two people giving the rude judgement geting like no points
i loved cheyenne she wasn’t too confident abt hers and she didn’t bully others.
Her wig just like her ramen, just wrong
Cheetah girl was getting on my fucking nerves
Literally complained about the first one being dry but then hers is literally bone dry 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Cheetah girl to pretty to act like that 😐
Ngl I thought you keep the water? I mean doesn’t that where most of the flavor goes anyways??
Literally laughed out loud when he said it’s dry as el
All of these looked terrible......
Cheeta print girl said it had no color yet hers was undercooked and the same color….
Cheeta print girl said the guys ramen is too dry yet hers is just undercooked noodles.
why are they eating ramen with a SPOON get yourselves some forks damn
does broth like not exist or what
*not trying to be mean or anything but I hate it. It's SALTY are you trying to KILL ME* It's called seasoning
cheetah print girl is a whole ass MOOD
If there broke how do they have amazing clothes and jewerly-
That watery one is not watery I don’t know we’re you been born but the juice is everything
Bruh shes acting like hers is the best when shes on a show to present her sad bowl of ramen that aint even made correctly 😭
I believe the ability to turn a pack of noodles into a delicious meal is a real skill🤣
the cheetah print girl reminded m e of my 8 year old self eating the raw instant noodles-
The way everyone’s calling her cheetah girl 😭😭
Cheyenne’s ramen is the only one that has visible broth
Why are they eating with a spoon??
She was way too cocky
Damn, people are out here making their own, I just add hot water and the included seasoning and call it a day
What if i told y’all, I’ve never tried ramen and I’m 15 ?
you mean broth..
Y’all need to understand not everyone eats ramen the same 😭
Season the r”A”men
AYEEE I'm Nigerian too!!
They need to try asian instant ramen. That chicken broth flavored instant shit they cook is not even ramen. The instant ramen in Korea is flavorful itself. You don’t have to add anything to make it flavorful. ppl can have flavorful ramen without spending extra on sauce or shrimp or anything.
people are so mean for no reason
wheres the souppppp
Why is it chunky???>:(
that girl ramen was dryer then the sahara desert,my granny elbows and knees,my body when i get out the shower,my hands after i wash them ,my lips during winter time 🤣
Water? You mean the mofo soup????
I thought ramen has soup
Did she say that the ramen is too…. Salty?
Wait!?!? I don’t think they have ever have ramen with broth
They so picky. I don’t care 🤷‍♂️ f the ramen blue green or yellow I still eat it like good damm
The cheeta print grl is getting on my nerves and thats why she got 2 pts.
my ego thinking i can beat all of them LMFAO
The spoons did it for me
I eat my ramen with the ramen Broth so I don't know why people eating dry food
Marcus needa stop saying lowkey
The ones with the biggest mouths loose, I love it 🤣
Bro who doesn’t eat with WATER
Ramen had soup idiots..lol..to the one who post these ...what?
Where is the soup?
Where is the broth at though, thats the best part
Bruh they are literally broke college students with terrible ramen thinking they are better cooks when literally all of the dishes look so gross and “taste terrible”
Ramen is literally soup and the fact that miss cheetah was like it needs to be dry, it rly made her look stupid. I’m sry-
The cheetah print shirt girl was so confident but nobody liked it💀😭😭
Bruh ramen is supposed to have a soup what u guys are eating is just plain ass noodles u baked in the oven lmao
Where's the broth??? Why are they eating ramen with spoons??? I'm in highschool and I'm pretty sure that they don't know what ramen actually is...
Ramen is literally a Japanese noodle soup WTF you mean, you like yours dry ?
They did Cheyenne so wrong with that thumbnail
They were given spoons to eat the ramen… what
I will sauté sausage and add a pepper and onions 🤤
You’re name is what??? (Immediately intimidated) 😆
Wait... having water in your noodles is nasty? I literally put water in my cup of noodles, microwave it & eat it with the water & hot noodles xd
ALL OF THEERE NOODLES WAS LOOKING DULL SO YEA
Eating ramen with a spoon ok lmao
Why do they never show the reactions of the other ones at the end
If my ramen would be dry I will not eat it  Girl if ramen don't have soup at all it is not appetizing
I would prefer my ramen a little more dry; girl you should live in desert
Cheetah print shirt : just to make sure I am not eating something bad ; girl you need test to test your senses  ( touch, smell, seeing, tasting )
6:43 "but it looks kinda dead" girl have u seen yours?
Cheetah print: 2:44 this is just dry  Her noodles       ✨🪨💀🌵🍜
Ummm are they dumb do they don't know what ramen supposed to be like? Watery? Ah
Bro the water is good bc it looks more appetizing
All I do is beat a couple of eggs in mine and it's so good lol.
does no one like broth :(
We need the clip of her seeing she got the worst rating lol 😂
Gotta be specific that their broke!?
I wanna know what tribe you came from where you eat noodles bone dry them noodles crunchy bro Cheyenne won bro I'm sorry 😟
Rasist
This is easiest why they all broke
ayo why they using spoons
Aint no fucking way they said the ramen has to much water 💀 its supposed to be like that
Her: I prefer mine with a little more spice, it’s too wet  Also her: gets rating of 2
If this bitch don’t shut up about taggoobaba and Crawh feesh I’m gonna loose it
Oh wow ramen is supposed to have its soup 😑
Ramen is supposed to be soup my dudes. The last chick sounds like she has actually had real ramen before
olu was there criricizibg like gordon ramsay and her food is so bad rats dont eat
cheetah girl's ramen definitely had a different vibe no doubt. 🏜🏜
Cheetah girl is annoying af
MFs complaining about the BROTH in the ramen, what the actual fuck.
1 for all of them they didn’t leave the broth or soup base in it. After looking the last one she did try but the soup base doesn’t do the texture of noodles well
Why did the ramen look dry
I like how the Nigerian girl said I don’t like it it’s dry. Then says I prefer it dry
do these kids know ramen is suppose to be watery..
Cheetah girl: " I wouldn't eat it at first sight " HERR RAMEN ARE LITTERLY ALL CHUNCKS😭😭 THE AUDICITY
The fact they decided to not keep the broth like thats the best part.
Where did they go wrong? “They woke up and decided to cook this” 😂😂😂
The fact that olu was so confident but lost I love it her noodle was dry
I honestly wish we could’ve have seen their reactions when they found out who won. Like cheetah girl, whew, that would’ve been nasty
The Nigerian girl saying that her ramen was Nigerian style is making me ashamed to be Nigerian like wtf is that?  THAT IS NOT HOW NIGERIANS MAKE RAMEN BABE!!
I don't think they know what ramen is 😂😂
Literally olu talking abt everyones raman: mean while her score : 2 IM DEAD LAOALAOALAOW.. And the girl with the black shift hers looked bussin. Ngl
Why is the title broke students that's so rude omg
Did anyone realize that the cheetah print girl said that Marcuses soup was dry and not flavorful, and then later on says she likes her ramen dry and made hers like that, it’s obvious they probably actually enjoyed each others ramen, and were just being rude and confident and showing off to the camera. Also the rating that the cheetah girl got is karma in my opinion because she was really rude to the other contestants behind there backs and saying hers is better because of her spices that “they have never tried before” even though that isnit a fact and maybe they have tried her spices before.
ik it is water but its actully called BrOtH get it right
IM A FIRM  BELIEVER IN KARMA LOL
I didn’t know pepole eat ramen with spoons
Wait what I’m confused they were complaining about the watery ramen but isn’t that how it’s supposed to be?😭 the instructions don’t say to drain the water isn’t supposed to be like that
YAS I’m african and the girl had me fav ramen
Watery ramen? What?!? Ramen is soup!
She was bragging about how she was going to win but she got a 2
@3:12
Y’all weird for not eating ramen with a broth, do y’all not go to ramen spots 😭😭
It's that girl from fortnite @0:07
As an Asian who eats ramen,this really killed me.Is it only me tho?
Where the f is the soup of the ramen
Fun fact: ramen is supposed to be served with soup, and u can actually get good ramen for cheap lmao
why is the cheetah print girl so rude lol I just don't get it I bet yours doesn't taste much better-
as an arab, i have nothing to say because im not asian.
For my ramen: I pour a little peanut oil in a pan Crush up my noodles a bit and add them to the peanut oil Brown them Add a little water Add some steak ums  Pour in ramen seasoning plus chili lime seasoning (tajin) Cook on high so the water evaporates at the same rate the "steak" is cooked" Possibly add some shrimp Evaporate all water before the noodles get too mushy RAMEN
ramen supposed to have " water " in them
I have no words.
She just said her mom Spanish 😂. Didn’t know Spanish was a race
Cmon man how did u never see a ramen with water in it..
is it just me or does all of these ramens look depressing
The disrespect Marcus had to talk crap about the others meal has me crying If anything I would prefer the others ramen over his.
Ramen is literally noodles soup
the girls ramen looks like she just put instant noodles and put the noodles in there with no water and didnt even attempt to cook it
I love how they were saying it’s too watery but that’s how actual Ramen is 😂
Very diverse
leopard girl  just stop sis. she like "my ramen comes with a different vibe, different taste." HUNNNYYY stop yes a bad taste and vibe. lol.
Cheatah girl: His noodles is salty AF Hers:🏜🏜🏜🏜
bro why does the guy look like an american smarter version of digga d
The fact that the girl with the cheetah print was so confident in her ramen and both of the people said it was disgusting
“It’s salty” Bruh it’s instant ramen
Where's the soup
olu was lowkey getting me mad she was dtm but still got the lowest rate
None of them know anything about Ramen that doesn't even count as Ramen tf this is just Ramen noodles with random shit and the guy said he doesn't like the water 😑 like bro it's supposed to have broth if not it's not Ramen the 'water' isn't the problem it's just that it's not broth
why r they eating it w/ a spoon😭
I was hyping the nigerian girl UPPP at the start until I actually say it and ooooooooo girl pleaseeee ADD WATERR
“This food dry as hell”😭
They don’t know how to make spaghetti I be cooking a lot but making spaghetti is cheap and can last long
The cheetah girl got her ass checked 😂
I’m offended that the cheetah girl said ramen was RAE MEN in the beginning
Ramen is supposed to have soup in it or else it’s just noodles. What I would add is kimchi, lettuce and sunny side up egg
I hate that the boy, WANTED or tried to find something bad to say about the last girls ramen! Literally it was better than urs just admit it. (No hate)
...ramen is supposed to have broth, r they okay?
I was like "where's the broth at?" then they have the audacity to bash my girl for leaving her broth when they left theirs looking drier than the desert
Ramen is supposed to be watery. It’s soup.
POV : ur Asian wondering why the ramen is dry asf
Nah cause what kind of ramen do these people eat with no fricking liquid in it?
Ramen is supposed to have water in it what are you eating dry bread just saying
I’m they broke and all but damn how u broke and don’t know how to cook
"the ramen are watery"  ... Sir, mam, this is ramen, IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BROTH IN THERE XD
I would had said the first two of them nasty bc they those  look dry 😩🤢 The fact that those first two even tryed to say her stuff was nasty  then continue to eat hers that's how yk that they like it 😭
Bet that chicken ramen from my local Asian market that costs .50$ a cup.
I don’t think the guy knows ramen if he said ramen with water is prob from the street-
“Look it’s a klhump”
haha we all know the struggle
Nahh cheetah girl angered me so much, she was literally fighting over ramen, like bro it’s friggin ramen it’s not like it’s some sort of five course meal
Where is the liquid!?!? Ramen is SOUP not PASTA! 🤦‍♀️
Ok the dude had tryed um I forgot her name but he tryed hers and he said “it’s dry as hell” 😂😂😂😂😂✌🏻
ramen is literally the best with broth
of course the ones who have clumpy ramen hates the actual soup ramen
Atatagoon
So much attitude for someone having the lowest rates
some Americans don't know what good ramen is lol even when you're broke and its on a minimum budget
How to make good cheap ramen  Cheese, tapatio   Ya welcome
Neuroscience oh hell yeah   Thanks for saving future lives
The cheetah girl get on my nerves
The cheetah girl get on my nerves
My Noodles are sooo different to everyone I see. 😂 I cook my Noodles and leave about 2 tablespoons of water in it then I put in my mi Goreng spices, then I add a tablespoon of butter, a teaspoon of soy sauce, then I add 2 tablespoons of peas sometimes chopped up fried egg, I then let it sit for 3 minutes to let the Noodles soak in the sauce, it may sound bad but it's bagning man. 😌😏
I don't understand how they said all the stuff they added yet the ramen stayed looking bland and colorless???? You can't be adding spices and siracha and not have our ramen have a little more color?? Unless I add way too much or something. Ramen is a regular struggle meal for me and the only way it stays perfectly that color is if I make it straight from the package without adding anything.   Maybe I need to remake it and see if I am tripping
I'm half asian. I believe that Cheyenne was the best out of the three
The ramen is a bit watery, like bitch do you know wtf ramen is like there’s gonna be broth unless you dump is out.
Cheetah girl if you like dry ramen just try ramen chips
im 11, not broke but i can make better ramen with a ramen packet and general tso’s sauce
I love that the cheetha print girl was takin all that shit, to get the worst rate, ong she deserved it
Am I the only brokest college student? We just used the seasoning packs from the noodles and may drain water to favored level y’all the fanciest broke college kids lol
Ngl these contestants were not bringing IT. three of them looked pretty bland af, and is it an American thing to always go that dry? Mexican college students we are more into cup noodles and you make it yours by adding things to the cup.
Not y’all making me hungry for some ramen
I actually dream of opening a restaurant called “custom” where all the guests get to choose what they want to eat, we will have a menu which shows what we have in stock 😁
why does american ramen taste like cardboard
The girl with the Afro said the ramen was salty then said it wasn’t seasoned well. So girl wdf goin on .
The leopard girl actually makes me mad.
My moms Spanish bro
It’s not water it’s broth oh gosh
Olu was talking all that shit lmao and also only time u eat rapen with no broth is with hot sauce
Do the others not know what ramen is? “I’d prefer my ramen more dry” like it’s called ramen noodle soup for a reason not ramen noodle pasta 😐
Cheetah girl look like ari lennox
That shrimp is lowkey lonely asf but she understood the assignment with the oyster sauce
Ramen is a soup!  W a t e r is involved!
These look like the most rudest people ever💀 they’re so quick to judge. Especially the cheetah girl
cheetah girl was like its soo salty are you trying to kill me. im like do you know what instant ramen is??
17
E
Looks like none of them can cook for shit
its broth right?
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THEM EATING RAMEN WITH SPOONS AND NOT FORKS
What kind of ramen are these? I only know ramen with broth. There are ramen packed with packets of seasoning, add it in boiling water and done. It's up to you to add more... this is not ramen.
My Asian heart is hurting💔💔
"Rawmen is a bit watery" well most Rawmen are meant to be watery.
these aint no ramens
None of y'all ass can make ramen
They’re all so annoying
lmao cheetah print girl got 2
dudes a hater fr 😂
Clearly I was lucky to have Korean and Chinese friends growing up, because this was all kinds of cringe and wtf. None of these kids know how to cook simple soup and that's just pathetic. Like, each one gets a 0 from me.
Yo gay guy u don’t even know how to cook
The most struggled part of this is the fact they ate some of this ramen with a spoon lmaoo
Why they calling the broth “water” ? 😭
This is what happens when you give Americans ramen noodles. They can’t cook.
Wait wtf. Why are they not eating it with broth. I am doing something wrong
She was rude but who cares she looked like an Egyptian goddess.
As a fellow West African, AFRICAN SEASONINGS DO NOT GO IN EVERYTHING 😭 KEEP THE SEASONINGS TO THE JOLLOF NOT THE RAMEN
So many triggers 1. Spoon with ramen 2. Dryness...over and under cooked 3. Cheetah (pussy cat girls) outit 4. "Kid not play" look a like guy 5. Not knowing about broths So many struggle meats - sausage, bacon, cornbeef, luncheon meat, sardines, EGGS, grate some cheese after its plated on top.ughhh you dont have to mix you can have veg, meat and ramen seperated... Also using left over stew or soup or toatoe sauce with hot sauce, some SOY SAUCE..... brb Im feeling hungry.  🥙🥗🍲
Anyone else wish they showed the reaction to the people who lost? Like how they are super arrogant and cocky then just wanting to see them find out that they in fact had the worst meal there and lost ☠️😏
Isn’t ramen supposed to have water in it, it’s a soup 💀😂
one thing about me is i would never taste someone else’s ramen and that shit look cold
Its the chunk casually sitting on the table for me lmao 4:27
lol she was like im gonan win heheh but everyone hated her nooodle xd
Wtf my Ramen does not look like this at all :/ why is there Ramen so boring looking
The act so weird about water in the ramen, like wtf there should be water in ramen..
That one girl really was saying hers is the best but got a 2 😭😭
The cheetah print gurl: "I mean, it does have it, but it looks kind of dead"  Same as you and your ramen.
america is the dumbest country ever. They just eat McDo in white house make shit and say that's shit...
The girl with the Afro was dtm. Ramen looked a mess
4:02 I can’t take another bite….. takes another bite
Her long ass name for no reason smh
Bruh why did you call them broke bro
Cheyennes ramen looked the best
Ok but don’t they like broth?💀
cheyenne is a queen fr
Cheetah girl needs to go somewhere 😂😂😂😂
These people literally have no idea what ramen is supposed to be. “There is too much waterrrr”   Yo, it’s BROTH
I’m sorry but I’m not a fan of Olu, like she is one of those people who think she is better than everyone else. Like She gives off petty vibes lmao.
oodles n noodles
"look issa clump" LMFAO
Does she know what broth is💀😭
I like my ramen a little watery with shrimp , chicken , beef or sausages with a egg in it
3 broke college students roasting each other’s ramen
I prefer ramen with broth so I know that won’t  bother me
Lemme on here cause my ramen is bomb
As soon as you eat that ramen your mouth gonna be as dry as the Sahara desert
When they start complaining about ramen "having water"... have mercy.
Nigerian chick needs to get off her high horse. Her ramen looked like dogshit.
people complaining about broth in the ramen like??? that's how it's technically supposed to be eaten y'all? 😭
I’ve never met a single person who doesn’t have the broth with the ramen. The broth is the best part!
Olu (The cheetah print one) was SOOOO trying to rate extra low to win. She deserved that two sooo much! I was so glad to see that!
I make spicy peanut sauce for ramen by melting peanut butter to a fine liquid and mixing with soy sauce, hot sauces and sesame oil...so good
Girl said why does it have water I like dry noodles
I would have done indomie ..with veggies and eggs ..delicious
What broke student can afford shrimp. I always kept mine as a soup, then added an egg, and frozen vegetables. If I could afford it, I would have sesame seed oil - makes a world of difference.
They do know ramen is a soup right?
“its like a bowl of bread crumbs” bro i died 🤣
All this criticism for some Ramen LOL
So nobody made a soup, the thing ramen is supposed to be...
The fact that they all black
🤣 olu rlly talken shit abt bros ramen but hers was the worst
cheetah print girl actin like she was a pro chef and she got a 2 lol
for anyone wondering ata gungun is just cayenne pepper shes slow
how collage students eat ramen to save money when a meal is like 1 dollar  burger is like 50 bucks where im from
the ramen broth is so good tho?!?!?!
girlie forgot to COOK the ramen
lorddd her ramen dry as hell
Eww look at those rock hard dry noodles.
Who removes the broth…. Also what the hell is Nigerian ramen. Its literally Japanese lmaooo
Curly trying way to hard
As a nigerian, I'll tell you rightnow we are rude people
I think they don't get the difference between ramen and ramyeon. Ramen is eaten with soup, ramyeon is eaten dry. Ramen is japanese style, ramyeon is korean style.
The broth is the best part of the ramen. Also if any broke college person is reading this: shin ramyun is AMAZING and if you want you can just add an egg, mushrooms (shiitake), any topping you’d like. And it’d turn out so good. AND DO NOT BREAK IT IN HALF PLEASE. Also you do have to have broth with it or it’s just weird
I am so happy that the girl Olu only got 2 because she said such men things abt the other contestants ramen and acted all classy as if her's was the best...
Ramen is soup… like who eats broth-less ramen??
Remen
no one came thru with the bacon egg and cheese ramen...   lil bit a hot sauce and bam, you in bizniz
Cheetah print girls annoying
Its crazy they didnt have to put "broke" I'm dead.......
No offense but her ego is bigger than her hair. But her ramen was in clumps lmao
Foreigners that went to school think they know everything 🤣
I like my noodles in between.     Not too soupy nor too dry.
why they aint give them forks or something 😭😭😭 this is a struggle struggle food video
They seriously being rude and critical on ramen noodles…
This is salty!!! DUH!!! its packet ramen!!! 1 pack has like 4x your daily dose of sodium
My girl broke af and this dude asks for more shrimp
I can make a banging Hawaiian style manapua man fried noodle with a pack of beef ramen  ( no it's not crunchy , it's chewy ) if ya know ya know   Ramen is also a great noodle for spaghetti . a jar of sauce lasts for 4 or 5 ramen   If all else falls just add everything red in your spice cabinet ( little bit of red pepper flake , cayenne , chili powder , Tabasco , lots of paprika
“The ramen is too watery” bro it’s soup?
Notice the title of the video and how thier all black
2:45   Her: this is just dryy  Also her ramen: 🏜 🌵
y'all IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOUP OF COURSE THERE'S WATER IN IT KAEJSHDNKJSD
tbh we all like our ramen different and we all have our own opinions but that girl with the cheetah print was just rude-
To all the  African people out there I am never trying y’all ramen 😂
Omg its salty!!   literally 10 seconds later: Season the damn ramen  me: 🧐 what you mean by that
isnt it supposed to be watery and the soup has the flavour?
the one with the afro is really annoying
WHY DOESNT ANYONE LIKE LIQUID IN THE RAMEN??
so....nobody gone tell them ramen is actually suppose to have water/broth lmao I cant with her clumps and his dry chicken...they got some nerve 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
she got a scicence major? she def experimenting with that roman tho LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
that olu girl seems insufferable.
why they eating with spoons🤣😂
"Why is the ramen watery?" BRO, ramen is supposed to be eaten with the broth
these people don’t eat ramen with the broth still in it?
Foreign girl is so pro

The one who talks the most shit has the nasty food
Im nigeriAn!!
Y’all don’t eat y’all’s ramen with the water in it ?😭😭 I keep it all in 🧍🏽‍♀️
Awe. This was uploaded two days before my Birthday. I always liked and appreciated a good Ramen. Chicken is my favorite flavor.
No offense. But hers didn't look good, and it looked way too dry. His looked pretty good to me.
Who the heck eats DRY RAMEN????
Like i really can't stand them for shit talking so much. DRY
Does anyone know what ramen is?? You don’t drain the broth idiots
I like my ramen both ways with the water and without the water and it depends on how I want it that day. But ramen is always a go to meal if you busy
The cheetah girl tripping talking bout she like hers dry you mean you like it UNCOOKED THE HECK ITS THE DRY RAMEN FOR MEEEE🤣🤦🏽‍♀️ I Probably would eat the girl with the black shirt ramen lol👍🏽
Satisfying af to see the rude girls ramen bomb 😂
I thought only Korean people call instant noodles “ramen”. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Lmao I kinda like mines dry too but not that dry 😩 leave a little broth 🤏🏾and I hate mushy noodles lol
I love how they described these students as broke.
Naija carried last in this situation 🙃
ramen with a fucking spoon?!
i don’t think this is called ramen
yo why they eating ramen with a spoon if not even fork
Ramen
No one gonna talk about the fact they are Geri f ramen with SPOONS?
Isn't ramen supposed to be watery? Or is it just the way we cook it here is different?
Man am I the only one that ate it with broth?! I'd pop an egg in there and everything. When I was done I'd drink it - it's good for when you're hungry and thirsty at the same time 😂🤣
There is so much you can make for cheap y’all just don’t think outside the box  😭 like sandwiches, hot dogs, quesadillas, make eggs with tortillas, grilled cheese , salads bags with all the dressings and toppings for like $2 at aldi…. And the list goes on 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
Why’d they all have no broth. Also, Olu is annoying as fuck. You can talk shit if your ramen isn’t even cooked
I was so confused. Ramen is supposed to have broth. Looks they haven't tried proper Ramen before.
Ramen comes with broth. But wtf are they using a spoon
When I saw the broth I knew it was gonna be fire 🔥
I noticed that olu didn’t say what she used in her ramen
ok
I like how none of them got good scores
lol, ramen with chicken en ramen with shrimp isnt that luxurious? the lowest rate is more realisitc imo xD
I hate noodles with nothing  u guys are so Selfish
*New title* "Girl starts to cry after eating ramen GONE WRONG 😭😭 😱"
Felt on that watery ramen
none of these three people have eaten traditional ramen and it shows 💀💀
Are they really eating this with a spoon
Where's the water 😭😭
The okueagabemea girl thinks this is twitter
Why y’all wasting ur ramen dry? It’s a soup? Get some broth for yall damn.
it be the ones that talk the most that lose
Gross
Why the heck do yall pick the weirdest fuckin people ever. All these type of videos have one person who is a complete ass and everyone is always against each other.  This shit is sad.  Also all these people in the video are dumb as shit for not knowing ramen is a soup. This video ain't even made April 1st either so it aint a troll, depressing how bad those oldies are at making basic ass ramen.
Ramen is supposed to have broth ffs
Dry shin ramen, garlic, green onion, honey, soy sauce, splash of milk, a fried egg  All you need
There are actually quite a few instant ramen brands that are eaten without broth and taste amazing! Try Indomie, Samyang, or Jajangmyeon (:
Respect to the dreadlocks guy. He voted fairly and not giving others a low score to push himself ahead.
Sriracha and oyster sauce is my thing, in ramen! Especially with a lot of the broth, yummy!
cheetah print really kinda mean
The person that was the most egotistical ended up with the worst one 💀
How do u eat ramen with no broth
do they not know ramen is supposed to have broth?? the only decent one was the shrimp girls
She has shamed all Nigerians with this dish
I’m Asian and I’m watching this with my mom and she looks like she’s about to explode.
Video is alright, it isnt really interesting though I think there needs to be more people in these "studies". 3 people really isnt enough
re-men, not it’s ra-men.
I hate the cheetah print girl Nigerians do not know how to cook
Honestly, I think all of these look awful? I've made ramen with and without broth and even at my most broke college struggle my ramen was better than this. Dreadful.
Ok but y'all ain't have forks to give them instead of spoons😭?
Ramen is MEANT to be eaten with the broth in the bowl these people dumb
That ain’t even how you cook ramen 💀
How do you fuck up ramen
most of the flavor comes from the broth
The cheetah girls Ramen was terrible absolutely terrible
“Shut down the studios!” Lmfaooo
cheetah girl complains ab the first one being too dry and the last not dry enough. wtf.
Bruh she really just said "like are u tryin to kill me uh"
Please don’t bring Olu back 🤣 I believe we can all agree to that
It's different they like dry ramen, I love the broth
All of dem look disgusting af
The boy was to funny
Olu letting us Africans down. Ain't you ever had indomie?
I knew who was gonna have the lowest scores lol.
Dr.Slone?
Keep the broth. And put a boiled egg. One egg costs like $0.17, and if you boil it first (then drain excess water, put in noodles & soup mix), then peel it and cut it in half, it makes the ramen look pro (like at a Ramen stand). I also keep a bag of frozen corn (dirt cheap), and throw a handful of that in there at the end. It cools the soup down, and corn is especially good in pork ramen. Even some green onions... $0.10 of onion per bowl. All said, you drop fifty cents of added ingredients per bowl and it's dynamite.
“I’m being serious is just I don’t like it at all” like dude don’t say that that’s just rude I personally wouldn’t say that to someone else out loud and that’s good she got a bad rate like lol 😝
“This shit look dry as hell” 💀
i always wonder if the people who were in this video come back and watch what people were saying about them 💀💀
I came from Snap and I'm glad I'm seeing Ola hate in here. Girl tried to act like she was a professional judge offa a cooking competition when her shit drier than the sahara
do they not know ramen is supposed to have broth...
And the cheetah print girl is Nigerian. We’re not like this I promise😭
Olu… who are u
well when you’re broke do you actually care about taste? Just buy shin ramen its d best lmao
They all said why is it so watery that's not water it's called broth it contains the flavor it would make the noodles have the flavor by soaking in the broth
“it looks like it was flooded” ITS RAMEN… TRADITIONAL, LITERALLY IM KOREAN I WOULD KNOW… bro the cheetah girl is getting on my nerves he ramen is making me sob
I eat it with a spoon and I put a lil water I hate dry ramen
“It’s too salty but there’s no flavour”… choose one not both
When you add extra seasoning to noodles it’s best to have water in it foolies🤦🏾‍♂️less chance of high blood pressure 🤷🏾 someone please shut olu up she sad af 😭
Love they reactions to the aggy bitch 😭😭😭💀
Hers actually have taste n it taste horrible 😭
It hurts to watch this when youre asian... props to the winner , thats one nice ramen. Cause ramen usually have seafoods. If you dont want broth in your ramen then you should call it PASTA 😂😂😂 or in our language , pancit 😂😂😂 . Broths are the best thing on ramen because you can eat more by putting rice. That way you'll save more.
Its funny how they all tried to do it their own way but probably would have enjoyed just the noddles with the in-package flavor packet more, lol. And you can definitely make packaged ramen any way you want, but keeping the broth is kind of what ramen is supposed to be. As in, "fancy" ramen you'd get at a restaurant would have the broth & all the fixings in it, so it was weird they kept calling that one "watery".
Try korean ramens from walmart. You will never go back to top ramen or maruchans. It costs like a dollar each (4x of regular ramens) and it's well worth the extra cost.
Olu too much bitch it’s ramen 💀 ghetto ramen at that Like stoppp talking about color an it looks dead meanwhile that print died in the 70’s but we won’t talk about that 🤣
So neither of em can cook
I'm thirteen. And I can cook better ramen than all of them 🧍
1:55 is that a SPOON I see? Hmm..WHY YOU EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON!!
Ramen is not just noodles, ramen is noodles, broth, and toppings
olu is so beautiful but annoying 😟
olu definitely is the person who is toxic and not fully entertaining or complete fun to be around. I know Nigerian cooking and it comes out bomb. she just can’t cook. maybe she can follow a recipe and not throw extra stuff in type. maybe.
Whoever taught cheetah print English made her cocky🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂
How the fuck did these people go through life incorrectly making something as basic as Ramen. The packaging has instructions and pictures showing that there's supposed to be broth left behind. These supposed to be college students God help whatever profession they end up in.
Why did they give them a spoon
They need to put my ramen on there I got concepts for days and I'll win every time
*This is JUST DRY and its not cutting it for me* *her: ICONIC UNCOOKED NOODLES (its not even noodles*
ole needs to be humbled
Cheyenne deserved to win, she was the nicest and the most honest.
The fact that they complain about the noodles being slimy tells me they eat their noodles before they fully rehydrate. Not letting the noodles fully “cook” I’ve come to realize, is pretty normal. I’m shocked none of them added an egg.
Sir/Ma'am/whoever those are NOODLES not PASTA (two different things) and it's supposed to be a soup💀💀 I never had dry ramen before (even when I buy it packaged). Not sure what they're talking about.
I thought production did them dirty with the dry old looking ramen but turns out they themselves purposely made it like that 😂
First off noodles shouldn’t be dry cause who wanna eat dry noodles and how did the olu make her noodles lumpy something ain’t adding up
Cheeta Print girl every 5 seconds: taste and spice
bruh.
Who eats ramen with a spoon !
The juice is the best part yall buggin
Why no one keep broth
If you dont have chopsticks please use a fork.. and cheetah print girl shouldnt be the one giving tips.
Eat ramen  straight outta the pot you making it. Put some crackers in it so absorbs the broth and tiramisu that shit.
Their personalities were trash
did no one stop to think about how they brought it from home and it’s been sitting and had to be reheated ?? that’s probably why they all taste bad
The one criticizing the other ones got the lowest rate 😂😂😂
As a person of color I just want to apologize, I personally love broth in my ramen as well as other Vegetables etc. my boyfriend wants me to make him ramen all the time now.
None of these look good
ITS CALLED BROTH ARE THEY CRAZY 🤦🏾‍♀️
Broke food doesn’t include meat of any kind
All 3 suck, ramen ( maruchan) just add water and enjoy that’s broke food
“I prefer mine dry” We know you do Ma. That’s why nobody lets you cook
She said it was salty but 23 seconds later it had no flavor?
Man they look goofy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"i dont like all the water in it" THATS THE BEST PART-
Them eating ramen with a spoon and not a fork 💀
these people DO know ramen is SUPPOSED to have liquid with it right? why were they actin like ramen is weird for having liquid with it?
Ramen already has its packaged broth, so imagine adding more salt or gallic salt. Paprika is cool, pepper too, but I wouldn’t add extra salt
How to people eat Raman without the broth? Just soggy noodles i means you do you
“It looks like it got flooded”  *Ramen is a noodle soup*
as soon as the video started and I saw all the bowls. it don't look like any of them know how to make oodles n noodles 😭🤧
_"I don't like all the water"_  Uhh... it's... ... ...ramen
These girls and the guy have lots of complaints . Ramen noodles is a cheap quick meal you can eat when you're broke. You can dress it up with stuff added if you've got the funds too. It's an ok not great quick easy  and cheap meal for when you're low on money. Seems like these 3 just want to complain for the sake of complaining.  Maybe they've just never really been broke and hungry.
„The ramen is a bit watery“??? DID YOU EVER EAT REAL RAMEN? DID ANYONE OF THEM EAT REAL RAMEN?? So my dear friends.. ramen is also a f*king SOUP!!  That’s all I wanted to say. Have a nice day.
this isn't eve how u make ramen
that girl was talking all the shit but had the fucking worst ramen
“its a little watery… and it looks grey.” “id make it more red.”  bro shut up.
So can Cocoa Butter not afford forks or...?😂
If I’m being honest all their bowls look nasty, even if you for some reason don’t want broth it doesn’t have to look like uncooked bits of ramen😐
If I’m being honest all their bowls look nasty, even if you for some reason don’t want broth it doesn’t have to look like uncooked bits of ramen😐
one girls attitude is annoying asf
The thing is ramen means noodle soup so The first girl was probably the best and they called hers watery so🥱
cheetah giving african, i know her jollof is awful
The only one that looked good was the last one
Whoever eating ramen with no broth you bugging
Damn this Olu girl need to just stop talking she is rude af and her ramen is disgusting ain’t no body like it she is a stuck up fake ass brat!!!!
"Not enough shrimp!".. Bro, remember you guys are broke...
Title: Broke college student ramen The college students: Add shrimp and chicken  And there's me eating the ramen just as how it's supposed to be eaten because if I could afford chicken I won't be eating ramen for sure.
Her moms Spanish? Like from Spain?
What a disgrace to Nigerian noodles 😞didn’t represent at all
theres different types of noodles in asia, ramen is supposed to have the broth yall
spicy ramen is the best for me
The Nigerian got humbled🥱🤝 L Nigerian
the lesson of the day never be mean and rude
They all can’t cook tho …
How can I get on one of these episodes. I want to do a Caribbean youth trying each other’s food. Cooking is one of my hobbies
If you're just going to use the noodles, pasta is already cheap. A Dollar Tree box of rotini pasta is $1, a can of black olives $1, get a $1 block of cheese, chop tomato and onion, sprinkle on vinegar to your liking (and olive oil if you have it), and you have pasta salad for 2 - 3 days.
The disrespectful ones always get The worst reviews lol
Bruh first of all the last girl.....that one that said 'My noodle has lots of spice and some of them they won't even know that it exists' is a jerk.Seriously has a lot of taste and flavour?what the frick? your is literally too salty girl. And too dry? ofc its dry it doesn't have any broth and yours too. adding more shrimps?bad idea would put you in debt cuz shrimp is expensive....you should be lucky that you even have one piece of shrimp there. Funny how the last girl thinks that hers is good but she got only two points
Who gave them a spoon?
That's NOT Ramen. This is actually highly offensive to Japanese cuisine.
If the ramen isn't gonna be in a broth, at least make it super saucy and not dry? The first two confused me lol
I just want to see the girls reacting on her getting low rates, like… LOW RATES. And she give them low scores while it was the worst 😂 😂 😂
how tf u gonna call that "ramen" without the soup....
i liked olu at first sight because she's pretty but she's like, so egocentric, it's okay to give your opinion because this video was totally about it, but she was just saying ,,i'd add my ata gungun to this and it'll taste better'', that's a bit egocentric y'knowwww
Do people really think you're not supposed to keep the broth?? Like fr?? Idk lol I usually don't leave YouTube comments but I am hella confused. I was confused seeing the bowls look so dry, but when it got to the 3rd bowl and everyone commented about how it was "watery" and "flooded" because it had a small amount of broth I was just....
The way he pronounced maruchan 😂
they dont know ramen u gotta have the juices the best to drink i throw some hot sauce and a fried egg and hot dogs or chicken if its been a good week lol
The thumbnail is proof they know what there doing
okay let me make ramen LOL
Bruh drowned ramen Df that originally how ur supposed to eat it lmao good shit tho
Lmfaooo I had to come back and laugh
These black folk from the suburbs and ain't never had ramen. I've never seen this before. Wtf the producers suck and need better casting
Damn this video makes me miss the dislike button ten times more
Dafuq…..  bro lol this ain’t rame
@african godess??? Go delet yourselfe
why r they eating it with a spoon 😭
I'm honestly shook at the fact that these three mutual "broke" college students have the audacity to act like Gordon Ramsay while reviewing other "broke" college students' ramen dishes. You guys are all broke college students, like I was. The fact that the COLOR OF THE BROTH was taken into account at one point as a deciding factor in this video??? PLEASE. This video has to be a joke. Like seriously??
My 2019 "deluxe" ramen in college consisted of normal chicken ramen with a halved boiled egg. Wash that down with a glass of chocolate milk, while you watched That 70s Show on Netflix with your buddies.... that was pre-covid life for you. Not a care in the world (compared to the garbage we have to deal with now just 2 years later). I wish I appreciated my stressful life back then because it was a cakewalk compared to how it is now.
i wonder no racism im black they are all black and i aint see a drop of  hotsauce but i seen some chiken
They calling broth water lol
2nd girl was way too confident.
Why does everyone eat dry mushy noodles
I really like how the first girl was hating on others ramen but when I saw her ramen I was like WHAT?? Girl are you serious you are hating on others ramen but look at you own!!!!! Lol.
"a little bit more dry" we know. we know.
*Worst contestants I ever saw in my life* except Cheyenne
5:41 aren’t you supposed to have THAT  *W A T E R* in the ramen 💀💀
1st of all... Cheyenne is the ONLY one who can make ramen. 2nd of all if you like your ramen dry with no broth at all you're a serial killer. Lastly, as someone skilled in the struggle food sector the best advice is to treat your ramen like Pho. Add boiled eggs, chili garlic sauce, a meat and green onions etc. You're welcome.
Why is there always someone in stuff like this that brag brag brag? Like, there is no need to be so conceited!
The guy and the curly hair girl dissing the water in the other girls ramen clearly have never heard of broth
We don’t claim her😭🇳🇬
Ma am it’s ramen it’s supposed to be salty.
ra mennn hedd aaa girl the cheater girl had me dead re menn head ass how can you not say ramen
Ramen is soup babes , it can have broth lol
"I prefer my ramen dry"  You're basically eating dry wall...
Like... where’s the water!!
I guess they couldn't afford water either
As a Nigerian I am embarrassed for Olus indomie 😭 Just NO! 🤦🏾‍♀️
🤢
This taught me everyone has different ramen taste.
''i like my ramen more dry'' '''the ramens a bit watery'' sis i-
Why did they find black people to do this...ramen is an asian cuisine???? Thats like having asian people taste test mediterranean food
*”My first instinct is to smell it to make sure I’m not eating anything bad”*  Ma’am the ramen you made was bad
I haven't seen a bowl a Ramen yet. Noodles in a bowl, maybe but Ramen SOUP it is not. Fail for everyone.
Its salty are you trying to kill me
"I'm not trying to be me or anything.. but I don't like it at all." *is mean giving that comment*
she cry's  over  a little salt  i would like to see her try  country fried ham
I hate that cheetah girl like shut up you have the lowest
But why they using spoons tho💀💀😂
Ladies and gentlemen the DRIEST noodles on the planet
“different vibe, different taste.” well she aint wrong
we need another episode of this
It depends. I usually prefer my noodles without the broth only if it’s chicken flavor or just a tad bit of broth to keep the noodles wet but for some reason the beef flavor pack juice hit different 😭 NO SEASON NEEDED it’s perfect as is.
"I like my Ramen dry" WE CAN TELL GIRL 😬
5:38 yes  dont worry we could tell
Yall... Thats just noodles, RAMEN WITHOUT THE BROTH? that aint ramen thats just noodles
“Why is there so much water” I mean can you even call it ramen if it’s without broth
She brought the worst ramen and had the most to say 😂 I hope she sees this and realizes karma exists.
5:39 clearly.
She said “ I prefer my ramen a little more dry” LIKE SHE DODMT HAVE WHOLE ASS CHUNKS OF UNKOOKED RAMEN
Not me thinking it’s gonna be spices and seasonings that are literally cheap cheap lol I eat mine with or without broth but I normally go with a little water so the flavor is on the noodles more plus I cook mine in the microwave for more convenience lol as someone just broke plain noodles of all kinds work just fine for me
The girl is giving tips bro shes so annoying.
"Why is there so much water?" "I feel like the ramen got flooded"  MY GUY THATS BROTH TF. hands down her just having broth makes her a win. she had saracha and shrimp she won. they really hating on ramen that has broth i can't 💀
They're Ramen Noodles, you can buy'em for a dollar 💲 a pack. How good can they taste?
I HATE THE CHEETAH GURLL THE AUDACITY💀
Just add some ata gungun
"ramen is a bit watery", well ramen is supposed to have "water", the soup or "water" gives the ramen flavor.
tbh Cheyenne was the nicest one there she was all, “my mom told me that, if I don’t have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything at all, so ima leave it at that”
The Afro girl is annoying
They know ramen is soup right? Lol they kept calling it “water” lol
the way he looked while he said LA + studio city lmaoo we all been thereeeee
“It’s so salty!!! It’s gonna kill me ahh” bitch… ramen is supposed to be a little salty
the girl with the cheetah shirt was so confident and shii she thought she was the best and she didn't even cook her ramen all the way 💀
That chic with the afro must not know what a "struggle meal" is. Like bro. They aren't supposed to be bomb its fucking microwave ramen.
6:18 no offense but ramen is suppose to have broth, also your "ramen" looked gray and dead🤦
They don't wet ramen??? even though ramen IS A SOUP
How does she say his ramen is salty at first but then tells him to season it with emphasis like there was none smh just shows some just talkin out they ass
ramen is suppose to have broth.
They all suck at making ramen, wth 😂😂
What will they do not look  poor
The girl in the cheetah print was just speaking her mind...though I wish she would be more humble about her Ramen.
why the fuck r they complaining about the ramen being wet?? I mean it's supposed to be a fucking soup dish. I'm not even japanese but americans confuse me
*cringes in ramen* I can't the only ramen that looked decent was the girl who won because hers had brother and actually looked edible. Dry noodles is just *cough gags*. Please guys try Mama Shrimp ramens. Boil the noodles with all three packages with a bottle of water, crack an egg in once noodles are nice and tender and steam the egg in the ramen for 2-3 minutes and serve with broth. You will NEVER go back to those fake, nothing but salt Maruchans ever again in your life. Asian marketplace sells them stupid cheap with rich flavors and variety. Pork, chicken, duck, shrimp options. The only ramen I eat without broth: Korean fire noodles. I am not asian btw I am full blown Scottish/irish lol.
LMAO Olu has typical Nigerian auntie vibes, the audacityy, her ramen was CLAPPED
can’t get over the fact that people eat ramen...which is a soup meal....DRY
Cheetah lady really acting like she’s Gordon Ramsey
ramen is never supposed to be dry never ever ever pour out all the water
I love how on this series the person who talks the most crap, has the worst food
Y'all eat y'all noodles dry 😭?! Wth.
not the cheetah girl acting like hers is the most flavorful, girlllll I KNOW that your ramen must taste like SANDDDD
“Water” 😭 I have never seen anyone eat ramen without broth
I’m so confused about why the two wanted to eat dry ass ramen 😭 the “water” is broth lol…..
ToT why it so dry oml
Watery 😩it’s broth
Naruto would cry so hard watching this😅
Ramen…has…broth…these college students acting like these are meant to be fancy meals, BROKE college students, eating on a budget! Did they forget the assignment??
Why they gotta be black?
“I prefer mine a lot more dry” hmmm I didn’t pick that up from ur nastiest u called 5 course meal
The cheetah girl was, no
Lmao it’s called ramen for a fucking reason ofc it would be watery it’s called broth! This ain’t no pasta ROFL
I just dislike all of them
This deserves the blindfold
They must go to school in flint and scared to use the water 😂. I ain’t eating the first two
if you are going to prepare a meal make sure you make something everyone knows NOT what u personally like as an individual.  For example of your going to make chicken, don't add a shit ton of chilli and spices cuz there are some people who don't like and can't handle such. make chicken that has seasoning and enough chilli.
aint no way their ramen is THAT dry
"it's salty" you lie, you didn't eat Ramen all the time.
That Afro girl doing too much
sus
How is it possible to eat dry ramen
lol, they could do a lil better
Y'all don't eat your ramen with broth?????
What in the damn hell are these people talking about WATERY that is the BROTH
There is so many things wrong with this video. Girl first of all “ why is there so much water” it’s called broth 🤯  And some of y’all noodles dry as the Sahara desert like Mrs ma’m u need some broth in there and let the ramen soak it up WHY ARE U EATING IT WITH A SPOON LIKE THAT TRIGGERS ME 😭 ✋🏻(unless their is broth but other than that no spoons)
I’m confused by what the heck there saying about the Ramen……… like Bruh chill it’s ramen……..😅😅😅
Damn they really went in no holding back they was really like my shit taste better than this
"re-man"
Ramen supposed to have water and  you'll  suppose to be struggling . I don't know you talk about  the color of the food for it has color
Lmao it’s a broke ass meal idk why they complain so much 💀, but that cheetah girl swore she was gas lmao 😂 she don’t look like she kno how to cook
It’s a struggle meal, shrimp is expensive af 😂 be grateful it’s even in there 🙏🏾
I was hyped when Olu was describing her ramen. lol
Olu is giving me the Cassandra vibe lol
if how they labeled them for me "broke college kids"
“I prefer my ramen a bit more dry” I CAN TELL BASED OF OF YOURS
I don't know why there were bashing on the broth. Even though I don't like a lot in mine I'm fine with a little so the ramen is a bit wet.
No not "reh-men" it’s rah-mennnnn
When ur broke broke any one of em bowls would suffice
The most outspoken def needs lessons
I like broth
The fact that they’re eating ramen with JUST a spoon-
“More dry”? She trynna sprinkle some salt on the uncooked brick and call it good.
she swore hers was the best lolll !
the ramen broth is the best part of rames in my opinion whos with me
Cheetah girl was rude for no reason like mama chill who hurt you? Damn
The same personality types are always here😂
It was broth because ramen is a soup
What happened to Ramen being soup? Why are they all just seasoned noodles?
really don't understand watery ramen as it consists of flavoured soup. either it's Japanese ramen or Korean or Malaysian or wherever it's from, it is a  noodle dish.. who eats noodles dry??? (unless fried).  broke ass kids dint even know how to properly execute instant ramen dish smh. it's really funny, the audacity to think it's wet? why the hell is yours dry??? and soggy af. I'm ready to throw hands
Its always the ones that be talking the most that lose💀 talking mad ish and still lost
The guy is so funny and chill
she said crayfish its crawfish im offended by that i live in the south ok
Whos telling cheetah girl and the guy that ramen is supposed to have water
Why are they using spoons
"I'd prefer my ramen a little bit more dry." Oh.. girl we know we know
Ok but who gave them a spoon to eat ramen 🤔😂
“This is just dry” wait till she sees her uncooked ramen
Where’s the broth?
Says it's Nigerian style. I'm nigerian I can't relate.
Can I get on here‼️
I love to add hot sauce on my ramen with cheese
Olu, what is you doing? Nigerian noodles are amazing. They have vegetables, spices, meat/fish, egg. I can't believe she lost the challenge. The best noodles I've ever tasted where cooked by a Nigerian.
This isn't very dattebayo
the female in the cheetah is pissing me of with her audacity of “suggestions” but her ramen is dry and nasty. she needs to get called out for that. like what you think this is? A STRUGGLE MEAL. At least the other contestants were nice ab it. that girl was a straight unprofessional hypocritical person.
You’re broke because you chose college, lmao.
Some turmeric powder makes the chicken flavor more vibrant and adds some more flavor. Honestly I would be looking at India's spice chart for seasoning noodles.
cheetah girl be like ew bish no one asked you
The cheetah girl really thinking the other ramen are bad but hers-  NO OFFENSE
Ramen is supposed to have water but just some
But bro…who tf eats noodles with a spoon like atleast use a fork
The 2nd girl just telling people how bad it is and then Hers is trash
Why did none of them fix it decently, like I understand you're broke, I'm broke too, but you can do better. It literally looks like they took the ramen out of the package, crushed it up, then poured a little drop of water on top 😭
“Why is there so much water?” That how ramen is supposed to look. not all dry, broken up, so much hot sauce, not enough seasoning.. that’s the struggle ramen, real ramen is with broth, egg, some meat. a bit of cheese mmm. 🤌🏼✨
That ramen looks dryer than when you first open the pack like bruh
This whole video is idiotic and agenda driven.
I love how the two people that didn’t know wtf broth was lost
they were complaining that there's so much ''water'' like its actually called broth 💀...
Why do people make ramen look like a complicated process. I put my ramen in a bowl, fill it up with water, and add some pepper. Then I warm it up in the microwave I’m good to go
the cheetah girl was giving tips, while she said rahmin. I was deadass so close to clicking off the video
They don't know what ramen 🍜 is
The drama queen it's salty u trying to kill me *cries*
I see none of them have been to an actual ramen place to know that the BROTH helps with flavor. Sweet lord, Cheyenne is the only one that I knew for a fact would be good.  Y’all broke college students, ain’t nobody worried about “color”, baby it just needs to taste good and do what needs to be done.
She got humbled 💀
Mine is coming in with all these flavors!!   Literally dry and bland as hell
students: I don't like the water in it  me: it not ramen without water um.. soup is most important part in ramen🤔
I love my ramens with a little water💀
I wish we could see their reactions to their ratings 😅
As an Asian, this hurts me. Ramen is a *soup* . Why are they taking out the "water"? Ive never seen anyone eat ramen without broth! plus, this is packaged ramen, there are flavour packets included that you can use. It isnt... meant? no, designed, for other type of spices. You can do so much with ramen, even when limited like that. Just some cooked vegetables and an egg here and there would work wonders.
That one girl was so cocky abt her Ramen and it look like barf 🦧🦧🦧
Am I the only that was confused at to why they're using a SPOON TO EAT RAMEN!!! 😦😦😦😦
the water is best partttt, was i raised wrong? I’m so confused
Dumbest thing ever, they literally removed the water but wait... it's a fucking soup ma dude, a SOUP 🤒🤒🤒🤒
OLU just made crackers tbh
Chicken matter not ramen!
The title 😂
Have y’all never been to an Asian restaurant....
Why don’t they like the broth in the ramen....it’s ramen it’s supposed to have broth tf??
It’s rude how the nicest girl won but they talked bout her the most
Marcus: There’s no way this is *fancy* ramen The title: “Am I a joke to you?
Damn
Cheeta print girl rating the boys ramen: this dry as hell Also her ramen: dry clumps of ramen
The Nigerian girl🤦🏽‍♀️
It's not watery that's part of the Ramen it's the broth🙄
Olu is a bitch like idk what else to say except for who raised her to talk the way she does she’s entitled for like no damn reason
Get a fat person next time he will win
Hate to tell you ramen is wet! Non of them can make ramen lol
Ramon without broth is rice… what is wrong with this generation
Why are the ramens all so pale looking 😂
im 13 and for 5.50$ (Australian dollar btw) i could cook better ramen then that leopard girl but the guy definitely knows how to cook also that leopard girl needs to stfu she doesnt know that ramen has broth and she judges people but she cooks blended crackers
..bruh
Thank God I ate Olive Garden, Fridays, Ruby Tuesdays, etc, the entire four years of college
The Nigerian chick was a tough judge lol. You have to remember the whole idea of this is " if/when you're broke and in college how can you stretch your Ramon soups and make them as tasty as possible with a low low budget."
2:04 it’s salty 2:24 season the ramen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
isn't it just noodles if it has no broth? not ramen?
I was so confused about why they were eating undercooked ramen.
bruh why nobody got any of the soup in it did they not use the seasoning packet???
The "ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME Æ" was everything 👏
Olu has some real Karen energy goin’ on.
I like it uncooked I would put the seasoning and crush it up if I was in a hurry
the pumpkin spice ramen is the bomb!
“ this one has water in it, I like mine dry” that’s a snarky comment for some one who thinks ramens supposed to be crunchy.
“ I add a lil… TinGlE to it
Honestly I would hav just mad normal ramen with a bull's eye omlette on top like that's better than what I've seen here and requires lesser ingredients
Title should be called broke black college kids smh the title alone is just feels wrong
little do they know ramen is supposed to be served with/in its flavored water 💀
someone give me a good ramen recipe
As an asian im just gonna say this. Their ramen looks sad
ummm
Wait who eats ramen with a spoon wtf???
this video annoyed me so much these kids have no clue how to cook and dont know anything about ramen
I don't understand.... they're so broke they're eating ramen (instead of pasta... which is cheaper? Maybe not in the US?  Anyway) and they have the money to add shrimp and crayfish...?
I must say this one girl has some pretty strong opinion that the other two aren't agreeing with.  Must be a cultural thing.
you call this ramen?? whaaaaatt???
Yo is it not common to leave the broth in the noodles? Been doing that my whole life.
pov: you like dry/uncooked ramen
cheetah girl way tooo forward💀💀
The seasoning packet is literally for the soup... I was expecting ramen with like an egg, some spinach, onion or something not just dry noodles dang
this was embarrassing
Bruh my ramen would be the best Downside is Saltiness
ok….am i the villain for having a lot of water in my ramen like i have noodles and then i have soup after 😬
Olu punching air as she reads these comments
NOT THEM CRTICIZING HER FOR ACTUALLY PUTTING BROTH WHEN RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH
Idk how college students want to act rude and picky over maruchan instant ramen… come on now.
the ramen has soup... no duh it's "watery"
Olu got on my nerves thinkin she did sum with that ramen. She eat her shit dry and was comin for everyone else 😭
Why are they eating their oddles of noodles (Ramen) dry not broth wth
I knew Cheetah Girl was going to be the Cassandra
where is the broth 😭😭😭
I like how they think there’s is utter perfection when they don’t even make a proper bowl💀
“This shit dry as hell” 😂😂😂
ramen has 5 different bases and broth is the main 1😭
Who eats Roman with a spoon lmao
Cheetah girl be eating the dryest food in the dessert.
So y’all eat ur ramen without the broth?
Leopard print probably asked for the manager when she found out she didn’t win!🤣🤣🤣
the other girl is taking this way to serious
:joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy:
Not my Nigerian sister embarrassing me. Smh
"being a broke college student is wack af...you have to pay for parking.." Parking???
JUST EAT THE GOD DAMN NOODLE FROM THE PACKET IF U WANNA BE FANCY JUST ADD A EGG
the broth is a key part of the perfect ramen
*”I don’t like all the water”* Well I mean it’s ramen it’s supposed to have water               *what’chu mean my boy? Gotta see it through my boy*
“Why the noodles so mushy”  *because my guy used fucking Maruchan and didn’t even add water*
I can’t imagine eating ramen with no broth
One shrimp 😂 Add some green onions! I love avacado! I want to try some egg.  I'm suppose to study and I want to eat Ramen now 😂
How you guys look so good than try being a college student and a single mum 😴
The first one was probally Mr Noodles! I never went back once I was able to buy my own && found itchy bun
That fufu chick is no way broke
Honestly they are all stupid af
I’m just mad they gave them a spoon. Lmbo
I like how the person that one tried it and gave a humble response. But when the other two tried the Ramen that wasn’t theirs, they had to criticize it from the jump. No sweety . Just try the freaking Ramen!  LMAO
My favorite way to make ramen: Start with shrimp flavor ramen (Maruchan is the brand for me). I find it easier to dissolve the seasoning by doing it separately instead of in the pot with the noodles like the directions say. So empty the seasoning packet into the bowl you're going to use for eating the ramen. To the seasoning add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, ginger powder, and red pepper flakes to taste. The noodles could be boiling while you do this. No need to measure the water. Just enough to boil and have some left over. When the noodles are cooked, transfer some of the hot water to the bowl of seasoning to dissolve. Add as much or as little water as you like to make a broth. Drain the rest of the water from the noodles and mix them in the broth. Sprinkle a few drops of sesame oil and mix for an added layer of flavor. That's how I do it.
Y’all don’t leave the water in your ramen? That’s broth bro lol
"i like my ramen a bit more dry" A BIT!?!? GIRL, YOUR RAMEN LOOKED UNCOOKED
I wasn't even aware that people ate ramen without the broth aka the best part.
"There's not enough shrimp." says a broke college kid. You're lucky you got any.
Either u can cook or u petty 🤣
If you drain your broth from the ramen. You’re weird.
Oluwamayonease:"this tastes like pasta"  Italians: *sharpening their knifes*
Ramen is supposed to be soup tho 😅😅😅😅 they ruined it  Cheyenne was right tho it still needed more water   But I guess less water gives you more spice taste so that alright too  But the spoon is a no no. I’d rather be eating with a fork tho chopsticks would preferable
They were all so rude ultimately and over fake ramen too? 😭
I’ve never been more disappointed
Them ewing at the ramen "water" is sending me. Its broth. Its literally how ramen is made lol
The Ramen is not supposed to be dry like I’m fine with eating small pieces of uncooked Ramen before I eat it but this is just horrible it’s supposed to be with water even if you don’t drink the soup it’s fine that’s something that supports the food without it it would be disgusting like just microwaved something that hasn’t even been cooked because the water does something
UCR represent!!!
Shordy said remen then said “are you trying to kill mEe😩”
Nobody talking about how they eating noodles w a spoon
I think my ramen is better then all of theirs
season the raaaamen the raaamen matter, 2 secondes earlier, its so salty are you try to kill me .... bruh
gotta love the title
Who eats ramen without the broth???
They have probably never seen instant ramen bowls
People eat the noodle soup without the soup??
"It's everything for me"😂😂
Like i swear, how the fuck do these people come up with this shit, what happened to making a pack of instant noodles with beef flavour, KEEP THE BROTH, add sum soysauce, some corn, maybe a cooked egg if you feel fancy and sambal for the spice. AND EAT WITH CHOPSTICKS PLEASE if you need a spoon to eat ramen without broth in it, you fucked.
yo i swear these peeps serving ramen without broth. Stop cooking, just stop.
Mayowa really came here and disgraced me 😭 Dude noodles in Nigeria and ramen are two very different things. Yo!
Why the hell are they using spoons to eat Ramen?
Why are they eating it with a spoon...
The girl talked the most shit but made a rice cake. 😐
I love how the ‘broke kids’ are rating the other meals like they were supposed to be gourmet lmao
The over confident people always got nasty ass food
So glad she won the other two were annoying and arrogant
Yeah you’ve tried ramen but have you tried raw men🤨
didn’t know ppl ate ramen without the broth until now 💀
ramen is supposed to be watery, i am confused
The fact that they hated the one that had soup spices also why tf are they eating it with a spoon.
i only like the american girl personality
Cheyenne can act
uh pretty sure my house is haunted cause i keep getting knocks on my balcony window at night and if i yell at it the knocking gets louder and i keep telling aunt and my brother keeps saying shut up and that kits " your little friends knocking or throwing rocks at the window" and i said that my friends are nice and got told to shut up plus no rock and imitate human knocking                 why would i season the ramen most of the flavor comes from the broth , ingredients and other add ons im sorry cheetah girl but i dont have enough money to make my own noodles and season them
D-d-d-Did she say oluwamayowa
I love how they put broke in the title🤣💀
i out here wonderig why they eating ramen dry tho?? like where is the broth?? ramen is packaged soup y'all
"Is that a hair" "no im just playing" 😂😂😭😭😭😭
All the asians cringing when they refered to the noodles as "RAMEN" and complained about the soup...
Think there's a misunderstanding of what ramen is lmao
that chick in the leopard annoying asf
Olu does not speak for us nigerians , I promise you😂😂😂
it’s always one that’s talking crazy & get the lowest score 😂😂😂😂
Cheetah girl is like a mini Kendall
They acualy did it 🤣 I remember a coment saying to do this lol he’s gonna be happy
Can i be on the part 2 cause my ramen hits hard!!!
Yall don't eat the Ramen with the broth??? tf
5:27 ain't ramen supposed to have a watery soup thing??
3:03 when she watches the people's first reaction.to her food even before they smelt it she is gonna be 👁️👄👁️
*it's salty like R U TRYING TO KILL ME?!?* 2:01
Why the fuck do people make noodles that are still hard I don’t get it boil it out man
I agree with the guy you should add more shrimp but like miss cheetah rlly wanted people to try her chunky ramen 💀
5:38 Yeah, we noticed. Your ramen could be used in construction.
this video made me cry. it made me sob so hard jesus could hear me from the sky. I cried so hard my dead ancestors heard me and wailed back. IT'S RAMEN. A SOUP. IT'S NOT MIE GORENG
They trippin if they don't leave a little bit of water at the bottom bruh
The saddest part is that none of this is true authentic ramen and I feel sad for them all around.
“It doesn’t have color.” Where tf was the color in yours?!💀🤚🏼
Its soup...why are they upset with the broth?
What college those girls go to? Asking for a friend 👀
Does the episode count as black on black crime? Cuz y'all niggas ruthless
“My mom is Spanish” oh really? she’s a language? cool girly
Lol wtf
Man Marcus was roasting the shit outta the other guys' ramen😭😭
Omg that cheetah print one literally annoying me so bad bro
“It’s everything for me” lol
When they said “Why is there so much water” I decided to go to my local church to pray for them to understand that is broth
"I just threw some chicken in it" sir I thought you were broke
gurl with afro “ it’s so salty is u trying to kill me 😩” her at the same time with the same bowl of noodle “ the only thing that’s seasoned is the chicken wheres the flavor 🤨🤨😒😒”
the girl wit the afro got on my nerves
AINT NO WAY THEY EATING RAMEN WITH SPOONS
Well then water just doesn't exist. You do you
the one with the afro she’s being disrespectful and not telling the truth she just wants hers to win but it didn’t work 😆 .
All of them look gross and dry.
to be honest you could just buy instant ramen instead of this and put in the seasoning instead of literally making it raw
Can y'all film the losers reactions too? I feel some of them would be hilarious
That Nigerian gurl is so irritating ‘I like to smell it just so I know I’m not eating anything bad’ she didn’t cook her ramen like it was poo
bro how tf do people not like having the water in w the ramen
honestly what's ramen *without* water??🤡✋ I love the ramen I make, I have different recipes and different spices I add into it but honestly, what makes a good ramen is a nice seasoning with a flavourful broth✨
Naw y’all all menaces y’all eating that stuff with a spoon
God stop saying low-key, no one says that shit in 2021
Instant ramen needs at least an egg, a good broth and scallions to be acceptable. Some meat, soy sauce and sesame oil to be considered a proper meal.
“I’m all about taste and flavor” “This taste really good but it has no color I hate it”
These people don’t know what the hell ramen is… ramen has to have the broth…. Ramen isn’t supposed to be without the broth then it’s not ramen it’s just fried noodles y’all need to meet some Asian college students who know how to hook it up with the ramen game their ramen game really weak
Do they release that to make ramen it needs broth?? LIKE WHY DO THEY KEEP SAYING ITS WATERY
Anyone here should try to cook their ramen in some toasted sesame oil, after you cook the ramen, the bagged or cup version don’t matter, drain and put it in a pot with the oil, add some soy sauce and your golden, if you have the packet sprinkle that in ( with a little water to dilute it) if not pour some of that soup water in their and yum, golden brown goodness
I'm starting to doubt the fact that they even ate ramen as college students LMAO they all don't know how to cook ramen clearly smh
You threw A shrimp
Bro what you mean edible  You get a pizza, and the guy said it’s edible what would you think
I know I am late but  New word “reman” 🤯😅
I feel like black people just cant respect each other and they always wonder why they fail. If you cant learn from people then that’s your problem. Our culture of roasting everyone is an issue because those people never have any substance themselves. It’s like collective narcissism.
cook for 6 min dump half or more of the water out get the mix stir it put cheese on it and boom good ramen and dont forget to eat the crumbs in the package
I'm sorry but girl olu you are stuck up for a broke college student.
I am sitting wondering why people are weirded out they have liquid in soup. The way I was raised it is a soup like none of those were adequate soup they view it was pasta and that's fine too but I was shocked my mother would have Roman when she craved broth and it sounds like if you can add that much meat to Romans your not on a Roman diet
When she said she would add stuff to it I was like dear god please no
0:44 why she pronounce ‘Ramen’ like that tho??? it’s pronounced “Raw•men” *not* “Raah•min””
did these people even met face to face? because i think they all thought they're dissing a white person's ramen 💀
Ramen is a soup, right? It's supposed to have broth. That's the best part of the struggle meal. These kids can't even make soup!
College kids ??? Kidss
"Are you trying to kill me ehh" Girl ramen ain’t gonna kill you where you going? To hell or something from eating ramen?
Why are they eating ramen... with spoons?
It's broth bro nah I'd eat all bruh I feel like with these videos ppl always flame each other
I like how marcus just roasts the hell out of everyone else's
If you can afford to put anything more than sink water and chopped up hotdog (or vienna sausages) in your ramen you are not a broke college kid LOL
A spoon ???
5:37 yea we see it looked "crunchy and crispy" like the ramen was in need of something.
In videos like these, it's always the one with the lowest score, who hates everybody's food. 🤣
I laughed when he said is that a hair 🤣🤣🤣
Damn girl. What the hell are you saying 😭 It's ATARODO NOT ANTAGONGO ffs😭💔
"I like my ramen dry" The ramen: 🏜
This cheetah girl embarrassing Africans. Like bro. 😭😭😭y'all, Nigerians actually make bomb asun ramen tbh. Don't mind the chick
Me: why there no broth 😭
None of these look good lol
The cheetah girl said “it’s too salty” and then ate another bite of the SAME ramen and said “where’s the flavor?”
the girl with the ponytails ramen looked BOMB
Oh how I make mine is I add a bit of hot sauce some beef flavor like broth and some green onion
How do you mess up ramen is my question
BYE why is it the ppl that talk the most be the ones w the worst food
Guys this is a just a snack flim meal  tbh   Marcus looks to be a 9.9/10   Olu looks crunchy 4.3/10  Cheyenne looks  like a 9/10 the 1 percent is cuz I’m allergic to shrimp
Tbh i think MY ramen is better. I just use the spicy chicken mr noodles and add 1/4 cup sriracha, red pepper flakes, a little bit of butter and green onion if I have it
There’s always 1 not annoying person thankfully
that "WATER" is fucking SOUP most ramens have soup without its a fucking chowmain
With a spoon????
nope cus i would still devour that into my lungs
Two packs a can of tuna,mayo,sriracha and lemon juice
They can't top my ramen lmao
she was eating shrimp but they call her broke 🤦🏼
only that guys knows how ramen needs to be eat
who is eating ramen with a spoon, is actually retarde bruh... 🤦🏼
Ramen is supposed to be liquidy WHATTTT everybody with their dry ass ramen like no sis that dont work unless u szn that bitch or put cheese in it or both lmao
"its so salty" she says then "the only thing that has flavor in this is the chicken"
THE THUMBNAIL IS A MOOOOD
add more water so you can drink the broth at the end and feel more full and how come no one had a runny yolk snaokxsosns its mandatory 😭
I love how they eat it with a spoon
no way the stuck up, idiotic one actually managed to graduate
eating noodles with spoons🤔……not even gonna question
It’s not water it is supposed to have juice people it is supposed to have a juice like that is the main part of It
WHY DO PEOPLE EAT RAMEN LIKE ITS PASTA?????? It’s SUPPOSED to have broth 😭 that’s part of the dish? that’s like just eating chicken and noodles without the broth and calling it chicken noodle soup
istg if they could buy “indomie” it would save the day it has SOY SAUCE , FLAVORED OIL AND SEASONING POWDER + CHILI
What do they do with the actual Ramen seasoning they get with packet?  That would definitely give some colour. Cause all three bowls looked pale af.
olu's ramen is as dry as a lump.
Im so glad I'm not in college with these asswipes
Now who tf eat they noodles like that 💔💔🤦🏾‍♂️
Notice how there all black
Where is the white and other races of people? I’m slightly offended
They didn't even make ramen... just pasta And why are they eating it with a spoon?
maybe they should try ramen not instant noodles then they'd know how it should taste like
Olu: me ramen has a different Vibe me: We Broke what Vibe?!
Where’s the broth
that boy got ramen growing out his head
Marcus and Olu were very judgmental about others looked on the other half Cheyenne was very kind and nice
The struggle is real lol
They some haterism in the house 😩
The winner did Not cook Broke ramen she cooked rich ramen, oyster sauce and shrimp is expensive
They could not have made this the night before cause ramen only last a few minutes once it's cooked🤔
To be honest all those ramen looked quite disgusting. Better to stick to the recipe on the package lol
I know she wasn’t dissing the others when hers was apparently the worst 💀
" I would prefer my ramen a little more dry"      WE CAN SEE THAT🤣
Is it supposed to have color
I wanted to see that rude chick’s reaction of her just getting a 2 😂
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HABE BROTH. WHAT ARE YALL INTO
i like my ramen with broth, add some garlic powder and i used to add Tapatío at the end cuz my Mexican ass but I cant have spicy stuff anymore, so just add some garlic powder
I'M STILL LOOKING FOR AN ASIAN PERSON YALL
I think I can make better ramen then them but I’m 10
Trying to figure out who tf eat dry ramen
Where tf the broth 💀
I like how everyone is negative just to prove their's better😂
bro the girls with the afro is so fucking annoying.
The winner was getting on my nerves the entire episode.
They should have said cooking noodles,none of these are ramen other than the last one.
Why don't they have soup.... It's RAMEN
Bro they so extra. Just put hot sauce on that shit or just mix the seasonings and BAM. Exquisite taste
Girl really said: SORRY TO THAT MAN 💀💀💀💀💀
"cmon guys its ramen" fUck Ur RaMEN WHEreS ALL Ur FUcKiNG Water AND WHy Are U EATIng  WITh A SPOON Ur dISGRaCINg my WHolE ANCeSTRy
Bro the chick with afro has no Palette, and she doesn't even know how to cook or what Ramen is holy she's stupid
My favorite ramen is Tonkotsu Ramen with veggies and buttered bread, it is so good and watching this just made me hungry af 😆
these people are way too judgy especially for their own ramen literally all of their ramen looks bad
you forgot the forkssssss
By the time you add the chicken crayfish etc, you may as well get a frozen dinner for the price. The point of ramen is that it's cheap, and takes little time, and cooking utensils to make. If you add a bunch of expensive, fresh ingredients to it, you're not really poor.
Cheyenne is actually really nice
I take that back cheeta print a bitch
Cheeta print look like the type of rich kid that didn't get money from her parents for her birthday so she said she was broke
The point of ramen isn’t to taste exotic, its to get by on something thats familiar while also not boring at the same time, i have a song on my play list called ramen king its just about ramen, good song.
they do know ramen is a soup right?
Olu is was wack AF
Why she tryna talk about other ppl noodles hers was dry as hell lol 😆 😂  I hate dry noodles
At this point i think the producers are telling them to be bitchy and one of them to try and be nice
They do know that ramen has broth, right ?!
“There isn’t enough shrimp” do you think this a Gorman fancy meal is freakin ramen wth🤨
The only thing I’m confused at here is why their ramens are so dry?? It’s supposed to be a soup!
ramen is too watery? LOL
horrible this is just fried noodle not ramen and eating it with a spoon god damn this is blasphemous
5:10 she definitely going through college kid struggles if she puts a shrimp into the ramen :D and girl, if you served this to me, I would throw up in it just looking at it and bet it would actually look better after
Growing up my dad always made ramen a certain way (melt cheese in the broth and add sriracha) and I never knew other ppl didn’t do it like that until one of my friends told me lol. For reference this dude is a drug addict and was not sober when he decided to add these things to ramen, but it surprisingly tastes good.
They don't have mexican on here? I get this is a black channel but they should use black broke college kids. Besides Asians mexicans are king of Ramen making. #Maruchan
I already knew Cheyenne was going to win after hearing Oyster Sauce and Sriracha
I don't know but I already felt off about Olu after how she pronounced "RaMen"
Do peoole eat Ramen with a spoon? That was so triggering for me.
Please we don’t claim the Nigerian girl plesee😭😭😭😭
The African girl extra 🤦🏽‍♂️ and her ramen look dry af like wtf is that
this is the saddest shit ive seen
they don't get to see eachother and react to their ratings ?? that was the fun part and it's not even theree
“remen to save the day”
Cheyenne was so nice!!!
It's almost like two of these people actually have no idea what ramen is, like they actually don't use broth, and the fact that someone would say, "the ramen just doesn't have any color" is embarrassing. About as equally embarrassing as referring to noodles with sauce as slimy.   You need to stick with cheese sandwiches or something.
Cheetah girl talking shit- say the ramen is too salty then complain about the only thing with flavour is the chicken.
"Dis sh dry as hell" 💀💀
Am I eating ramen wrong or something why are they eating it dry with no soup ??  I’m confused
the cheetah girls ramen  it looked so uncooked, its a whole lump 💀
lol when Olu tasted Cheyenne’s and realized it was better than her own she tried criticizing everything besides the taste
it’s called a struggle meal, not a gordon ramsay meal 😭🙄
Where’s the WATERRR
Ouh wait till they try a ramen made by a broke Asian kid they cant even say nothing 😂
The dry ramen girl just radiates pick me energy
"oh my god its salty" Me - ;-;  *literally 1 second later*  "the only flavour in this is the chicken" Me - ;-;-; i thought it was salty  *few seconds later*  "Season the ramen" ;-; ;-; ;-; i thought u said it was salty
“I like my ramen a bit on the dry side”    Me: 👁👄👁
I dislike the bitter commentors who take such competitions like these seriously. Who cares if the cheetah girl was cocky. It wasnt that big of a deal. Yall just trip and cry like bitches over anything tho. And that wint change.
Rice Beans Repeat
Sad ass kids. My go to recipe is. 1 pack of creamy chicken ramen Onion powder Garlic powder Pepper Carrots Chicken Shredded cheddar cheese Crackers
2:24 COOK THE RAMEN   THE TEXTURE MATTERS
I would straight up take pork chops or grilled chicken from the cafeteria back to my room so could make a full ramen meal. 😂
It’s always the arrogant people that is embarrassed
why are they being so picky lmaoo
Someone complained about watery soup....Has she even tried to look on the packaging instructions it clearly says bring water into a boil add noodles and seasoning never seen instructions on packaged ramen saying drain the water after boiling noodles? lol.  Girl if you want a dry noodles try a stirfried noodles/instant yakisoba noodles there's a lot of variety available in a asian grocery store or even in some convenience store like Mi Goreng (Sorry if I spelled it wrong or named it wrong), Pancit Canton, Nissin Yakisoba.  Sorry to say this cheetah not to be disrespectful but your noodles is near being a drought or like you blanched it into water and the take it off add the seasoning.
The cheetah girl is so annoying
Not to be racist but like  Why are they all black Like couldn’t they get like a white person Are they trying to say black people are broke?
Me with my Pepper Salt beef packet and old bay ramen: ._.
I'm glad af Olu lost, she so annoying
This hurts. As a broke asian, these recipes were surprisingly disappointing and I hope one day they can learn the ways of making real, tasty ramen. Whether you prefer the broth or not, struggle ramen can easily become a delicious, quality meal. For instance, the texture of the noodles looked strangley congealed, mushy and/or slimy.. they looked like it lacked spices and there's just much more that could have been added to get some cheap nutrition in (egg, vegetables, additional sauces). I'm not saying my ramen is the best and I'm sure they all have delicious recipes of their own, but holy shit they could really use some tips when it comes to making ramen.
Yeah that "different vibe" is the vibe of a septic tank truck turned over on an Arizona Interstate.
The person who talks the most trash is always the worse cook. Never fails
I like how cheetah girl was just complaining about the other people’s ramen but then hers was literal chunks and dry
Someone tell me right now that theyre acting.
I like the girl in the black shirt but the girl in the cheetah shirt needs to chill 💀 "it's salty" it's R A M E N
that girl with the cheeta shirt only givng her low ratin cause she had bad taste mad it taste good and dont want her to win lmaooo
Come on 2 set down be humble lol
My homeboy's lock up everywhere😂 got the best Ramen...
To be real, having been around Nigerians cooking, their food can be really good (I actually like it) but it always smells bad for some reason and it tends to look off putting. If anything, it’s for really experimental eaters if you’re not Nigerian.
thats not even ramen wtf
i dont think theyve seen real ramen o-o
while i was watching this, i was like "uhmm is this ramen or canton?" hehe
There's a difference between "dry" and "undercooked" lol.
That was so sad for so much ego. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Is it just me or the winner One looks good the other contestants ramen looks dry The other contestants got to go she deserves to win
*SHOUT OUT TO SIS WITH THE NOODLE CLUSTERS you tried sis....SMH you tried xDDDDDDD*
0:44 sorry I thinks it’s called                       remen
Only Cheyenne knew how to actually make the "Ramen". Cheetah girls weird and dude with glasses made his noodles like pasta. Fuck outta here.
After 5 1/2 years locked up......I could def help these kids taste buds. J.s. ( chili flavor Ramen, jalapeño cheese, chopped up summer sausage, and left over chili 🔥🔥🔥)
they complaining about soup being too watery 😂🤣
Do people actually eat without the broth 😨
Dry. Noodles. EW.
She said next but there was no next
Love the title   Love how it comes with the disrespect
I eat it raw
gotretarded people on here
Why can’t they find ppl who can actually cook???.
As an asian, I feel offended
Who eats dry ramen?   Btw it’s “oodles and noodles”
Show did that olu girl even get into college 💀
First of all y'all say its so bad but none of yours were good
Oluwamayowa shindeiru
"like it's ssalty are you trying to kill me-uh?!" lmao not trying to be rude
My guy over here being so picky and yet it’s a broke meal and ramon is a soup
I really like the emphasis of ‘broke’ in the title
"Im sure mine is gonna win"  Lost so hard she became 4th place. Not even 3rd
i like how they said “it’s too watery i don’t like the water” dude isn’t ramen supposed to have *SOUP* originally? 😩
Remin
The ramen is probably cold asf anyways
Anybody just eat it raw
Ramen is a soup and they are complaining about the water in it smh☠️☠️☠️
Marcus and Olu are so mean, like literally? Bro, that looks bomb, I’d love to try it. Ya‘all just salty over winning, that’s it.
How tf are they gonna say the ramen is too wet or flooded when ramen is and always will be a broth based bowl of noodles..? Its literally noodles with hot broth on top!!
Olu: its too salty   Olu 2 seconds later : it has no flavor
It’s called broth, not water.
For me I just buy the stuff from like the dollar store pop that bad boy in the microwave with some water and bam… the one thing is you gotta eat it fast before it gets soggy
"I'm pretty sure this is gonna win, bring it on 😌"  *Gets the worst rating*
Ok things that threw me off is that they are most likely only using chicken noodles I’m not a broke college student actually I’m only in high school but non spicy noodles just ain’t it and they eating with a spoon??? And can you even consider ramen, ramen if it ain’t got the base or soup in it like that’s called noodles ain’t no ramen
me eating ramen rn
Why are they eating noodles with a sppooon!
I'm sorry but u shouldn't have to basically starve just to go to college. The system is a failure and needs to change NOW
They don't have chopsticks, but they have fucking spoons. NOT EVEN FORKS. AND THEY COMPARED IT TO PASTA!!!!!
Pick people who can actually cook . Wtf 1. ramen was soup less  2. Had fucking clumps in it talking bout Nigerian ramen 🤣🤣🤣 look like she made it in the desert. 3. Need to work on texture of noodle.  But was closer than most.   Really nope none of them are anime fans
These dishes are looking soooo anaemic - you don't have to have loads of money to make good ramen
“it’s too salty” girl it’s ramen..
Olu's delusion level is 100/10
the cheetah girl was just rude🤢
Omg they complain too much jeez
The greatest sin in this video is that they’re eating ramen with a spoon
I love oyster sauce in my ramen!! Also moooost of the time I dump 90% of the broth, add some sesame oil for slip, extra seasonings & some veggies if in the fridge.. 🤤
I have three ways I make ramen so far and I'm just 14. Number 1 is soy sauce ramen; make beef ramen, drain the water, take a tbs of butter or margarine, add that in then mix, then get 5-10 splashes of soy sauce and mix. Number two is spicy chicken ramen; take some chicken ramen, boil some water, when the water starts to boil, add garlic season all, basil, pepper, and pork and poultry dry rub seasoning, then add your noodles, make sure to keep the broth for it is really good for you. Number three is Mac and cheese ramen with hotdogs, make normal chicken ramen, drain out the water, add two slices of American cheese or any sliced cheese, then add a pinch of grated cheddar cheese, then cook two hotdogs for 25 seconds each, put them in the bowl then mix and mix and mix until the cheese is mixed up well and the hotdogs are in chunks. Enjoy these.
Are we gonna ignore the fact they called them broke
Less than 10 points out of a possible 20, we need new contestants.
Tbh I'd say all of there ramen noodles were all dry and garbage just put hot sauce stir it up and enjoy it's that simple 🤦🏾‍♂️
Shout out to the Yoruba girl pronouncing her name properly 😂. Even spoke about the ata gun gun, if yk yk😂
1st girl calls herself a God smh 🤦
cheyenne is so SWEET 😭❤️
Basic ramen is already pretty cheap, this is just sad
I'm glad to confidently know i can make my 2 dollar spicy noodles/normal noodles much better than these knobs
It’s ramen. How much better could it get possibly get?
not the african saying it’s salty 😭😭
Olu seems like she’s acting 😂 but she’s camera shy and nervous
Olu:"This is really salty...Are you trying to kill mee!?"    Her 30 seconds after;"Season the ramen...the ramen matters(scoffs with eyeroll)."
Wait so she said it was salty then she said season it ????
All of their ramen dry asf
Hold up did they say it was wet it’s freakin ramen it’s a soup  the cheetah print girl hated everyone’s actually everyone did
“ there’s not enough shrimp “ Boi, AT LEAST THERE IS SHRIMP.
How you gonna make a video about ramen but not have a single Asian college student 💀
I don’t understand? what did kylie Jenner do to people?!  Ramen is supposed to be a soup...
All Asian are like... Ramen?
They know ramen is a soup right?
I'm just not going to watch this garbage again. The most people are mean af for no reason other than trying to secure a good score for themselves. This by far is the worst episode yet. I mean it's freaking ramen. Plus I've seen the Indians do better things with ramen and their people aren't as mean for no reason as the American ones.
why didnt any of them have water? i eat ramen like a soup
pls the ones who chat the most trash always be losing 💀
That ain't ramen lol
Bruh I literally just add water but it in the microwave for 6 mins comes out great 😩 idk what they doing
LMAOOOO the keke palmer reference
Black girls are Soo beautiful!! 🤩😏
the cheetah girl: I’m not trying to be mean also her: I don’t like it all
Y’all need to realize that the Olu was probably born at Nigeria and quite frankly they probably don’t have much water there
Yall the girl with the ramen with water had like a drop of water. Yall never had normal good ramen? Like uhm tf
" my mom is spanish " 🤚 sis....she can't be because no one calls them spanish.  Honey that's a  language..not a person. What you ment.." hispanic ..my mom's hispanic " 🤦🏽‍♀️
Bruh I’d go for Cheyenne’s just because at least her noodles don’t look crunchy or lumpy.. like ramen should have soup at least Dx like what happened to just boiling water and putting the soup packet D’x
isn't ramen supposed to be eaten with the water
My ramen is sri racha ramen, but cooked like a fried rice if anyone understands Cook ramen with water, maybe add chicken flavouring but not the sri racha flavouring yet in the sauce pan, then on a different pan save a little of the stock like just enough then add a whisked egg to the noodles and then add the sri racha flavouring maybe add garlic salt, carrots  and green onions cause why not, I love making it, still trying to perfect it though
bruh i could make better ramen then all of em with 10 bucks siracha, pre made bowl of ramen, jalapeno, onion, and if i had enough money left soft boild egg. I know with ten bucks I wouldnt be able to buy any meat but you dont need that
They should try my chi chi ramen 🍜 they would beg for mor!!!!
"The Ramen looks watery".... it's literally soup bruh 😒
They ever heard of broth?
Why does no one have broth in their ramen…
I saute onions, green peppers, red peppers (frozen bag for 1.50 and only use 1/4 cup) with bacon (ends and pieces about 2-4 bucks) then add ramen, a little water and steam till noodles are done and this can literally make a 2 bowls of ramen a day for 30 days all under the price of 15 bucks depending on how much your ramen cost. Mine is 4 for 1.
My ramen just be chicken flavored with a little black pepper and an egg if I wanna be fancy.
What I learned from this video is there's a HUGE difference between being a 'broke' college student (a rich kid having to struggle temporarily for the first time) and a person who grew up poor. Poor people are grateful for food, would never be so rude when presented with it, throw it on the table, or spit it out of their mouth. And 2. Poor people are extremely creative with their struggle meals and will find ways to add nutrition in the cheapest way they can. Not a single one of these three said anything about how if you're eating ramen out of necessity you're just happy that it fills your stomach. Also, calling the broth water made me cringe so hard.  I did not enjoy this video.
spoons?
I saw ramen on the title and then while watching..  RAMEN.. is that even ramen?? The only thing that makes that ramen is the noodles😂
“I don’t like the water” IT’S BROTH. IT’S RAMEN
PLEASE THESE PEOPLE LIKE DRY RAMEN      *HOW PLS JUST HOW*
“I’d prefer mine a little bit more dry” GIRL WE KNOW 💀
Olu  a little full of herself💀
This is the most American things I’ve seen....ramen is soup it’s supposed to be watery 😭
The other contestants were kinda…. Rude
Why does the hater always have the worst food?
the spoons though lol
Whoever made this tried  girl you had a 2
There using a spoon to eat ramen
I bet Cheyenne’s ramen was the best and I’m sad that all the other ones didn’t know that ramen was a soup
Honestly for me any white ramen is a sad ramen 😹🍜
My go to ramen is black bean ramen with a sunny side up egg on top (sometimes soft boiled depending on how I feel.)
Y’all never heard of broth?

Lol I love how she talking about salt(cheetah outfit lady) when she said she put all that seasoning 😂
No, cause where tf is the broth
Mate to be honest I like the chunks in my noodles LOL😂 it fr taste bussin the texture of a block of goodness in your mouth and BTW is no one goin to talk about how the girl said ramen she literally said RIMEN 😂
Is Marcus the same guy that dances with a duck twirking video Lol🤣🤣🤣🤣
I cant get passed the SPOONS!!!!
I would have bodied this noodle game 😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♀️
Boil the water add seasoning before noodles add some chicken bouon seasoning then add noodles shortly after boil for about 10 to 15 mins add an egg in that hoe bam bomb noodles
DID I JUST FIND A NEW FAV CHANNEL? POSSIBLY.
Do Americans not know what ramen is
She bms like gurl being rude not cute
One of them said the others looked dead but There's looked like rigomorous set in
Thats not even ramen
What a horrible girl, she deserves to be broke and eat plain ramen. 🤨🤦🏻‍♂️😅 But the winner was a worthy one, she seems like the type of person I’d like to hang out with. 🥰😍
i need to know their process of cooking ramen, like…why are they just cooking noodles with no broth😭 what do they think the packet is for
WHY ARE THEY EATING NOODLES WITH A SPOON
ramen is ramen
Bro they are like it needs more shrimp aren’t they broke???
I feel like they’re over doing it man
To be fair...Ramen doesnt taste good after you cook it and leave it alone for hours before filming.
ramen supposed to be watery lol/ to be more exact with soup
Ik ramen is supposed to be soup but i drain the water and put in the flavor and it bussin
Who the hell eats ramen with a spoon. You use a spoon for the broth....
Cucumber oil!??!
No eggs? 🙃
As an Asian it’s painful to watch this but I’m glad that girl won cuz she’s honest and respectful
New Lesson: eat maruchan
The girl in the leopard shirt capped on the guy so hard 😭👎🏽
First of all y r they eating it with a fucking spoon
Ramen is a soup dish, don’t Americans know anything?
They hating hella 😂
The critical girl was tripping this meal is cheap on the go i won’t ever put spice in my ramen unless it’s the packet. Same with the uh cheyanne? idk but i hate broth or water in my ramen. I guess i’m a basic dude ramen and the spice from the packet and just eat it.
“I prefer mines dry” bae, you didn’t even have to say it, we already knew.
My student ramen recipe.  Normally I have some leftover meat from home. warm it up and chop it up.  Noodles with chicken flavor spice added chill flakes. Frozen mix veg. Microwave for two minutes.  Empty half or a bit more of the broth then add chopped meat.
i feel like olu was trying to be funny and sarcastic but it came off as rude
All of their opinions don’t matter since they ate ramen with a spoon
You can tell they never had real ramen when they came for the girl who actually did it justice lol
I prefer my ramen dry……
why is there no water
Ummm Ramen is supposed to have broth... lolll
Watching this series just makes me realize African/Caribbean people are picky and judgmental for absolutely no reason 😂 the only thing they cook well is curry,oxtails,and jerk chicken
wait WHO TF EATS RAMEN WITHOUT SOUP? LIKE WTF IS WRONG WITH YALL
This is cringe af
Yesss!! Like.girl was talking such abt her homeland spices like.girl you got pride I give you that but that pride don't.go to them taste buds💀
you ain’t that broke if you can afford chicken and shrimp
Ramen is literally a soup
The water is called broth
not all ramen is soup based idiots. its their preference.
Do y’all not eat ramen with broth? They were hating on the “watery ramen” but I’ve never eaten ramen without water.
WHY ARE THEY EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON WTF IS HAPPENING HERE
i wonder why theyre all black
They must be running out of ideas
😆❤️ funny.
ALL OF THEIR RAMENS, BAD BAD MEDIOCRE
Why are yall saying the ramen has water??!! 💀💀 im dead confused ? Isn’t ramen or instant noodles MADE with WATER?? And RAMEN  SPECIFICALLY HAS A SOUP BASE
When I make ramen I put the least amount of water in a pot to cook the noodles enough. Then I let the liquid thicken and add the seasoning to stick to the ramen. Then I add a egg yolk to it
Olu: "I prefer my ramen a little more dry." The audience: "Oh, we know."
All of it is just bad lol. Fried egg sriracha and ur good
cheetah print gtg😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Out of all DRY ramen , it’s too dry .. soupy ramen, it’s too soggy .. 🧐 idgi
She said it was salty then said it had no flavor PLEASEEE 😭🖐
reameon
It just make me so mad that they eating noodles with a SPOON. And despite the fact the Cheyenne’s noodles are “watery” when it’s literally supposed to be soup.😐
Bro. Ramen is literally NOODLE SOUP why tf are they complaining about the water
Your mother Spanish but you look black 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Big hair girl was so confident and arrogant then brought some uncooked dry shit out 💀
Watery? Guys thats b r o t h im so confused
How do people like dry ramen with no broth? I don’t understand
I'm sorry not trying to be mean but my little sister can cook better than all of that😦😴🤞🏼
Anybtrue broke a** college student, couldn't afford shrimp. I think someone was lying!!
THIS WAS SOOO FUNNY!!! i LOVE THE CONTESTANTS
But some ramen really contains water like if it's too dry then it's not a ramen at all?
OMG !!!! It's ramen, my 10 yr old knows how to cook this, smdh !!!!
da fuxk dey eatin it wit a spoon for?
Something that bothers me is that they are eating it with spoons I usually see people use chopsticks or forks not spoons💀
I just wanna know why they're using spoons.
How is it ramen there’s no broth the third one is ramen
I haven't finished watching the video and I should but just seeing the first one I hope someone puts liquid in their ramen.. for real because if you don't... Like WTF. Sometimes I eat it without liquid but most of the time I add Louisiana hot sauce and lime to my soup and it makes it bomb.
ramen is soup and is supposed to have water in it. thats what makes it SOUP. doesnt have to be drowned in it, and dry ramen is 👎🏽. my ramen would beat all of theirs tho😹
All there ramen look so unappetizing 🤢
noodles in the microwave 5-7 minutes with alot of water so the noodles cook then u pour most of the water out and season the noodles not the water it’s should be moist not mushy. yall be putting the season in while its boiling on the stove and the season go straight to the water not the noodles
yall get the worst people for these
As someone who has been eating ramen for most of her life, WHY do people eat ramen without broth?!  Omg, Japanese people are crying right now. Where is my egg, broth, sesame oil, and sriracha?! I know this is supposed to be broke meals but like, broth costs nothing.
asian kids: yall call that instant ramen?
'Broke College Kids' You guys really couldn't find some white kids... i mean im just sayin ion care but i thought it was funny ASF (ok this is about 2 minute in and 2:01 average privileged at one point black kid kinda want to slap her ngl)
The guy who said need to put more shrimp bruh let me remind you important thing. YOU ARE BROKE YOU CAN BARELY AFFORD RAMEN AND NEED MORE SHRIMP.
Cheetah girl gotta learn her place fr💀💀💀
these people dont know how to make instant ramen
Who gave THEM SPOONS FOR RAMEN 😭 I can’t even use a fork or else it don’t taste as good idk why 😳
Ughhh whoever started that tradition that ramen is supposed to be dry needs to be locked up.    ITS A SOUP. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE JUICY.  Lol I hate when my siblings come in and start judging my soupy ramen. Let me be and enjoy your dry ramen in peace 🤣
Bruh this is so cringe. Who chose these for college Ramen lmaoo fake af
Ramen... traditionally a soup... and yet they complain about it having a broth?
they dont even deserve to make ramen pls
I understand not likening watery ramen. I normally drain the water because I enjoy the texture and I feel like I get more flavor without the water. But everyone has thier own thing
Yo who eats ramen with a spoon😰😰😰😰
Why is there always one person in these videos being disrespectful and giving low scores but they always come last with their crap take on the food? Like...is it actors or people generally self-sabotaging out here?
You give it a 3 but you liked it? Girl you wanted to win so badly
I like how the girl with the afro seemed to be finding ways in her head trying to give reasons to dislike the shrimp ramen
It’s always the petty ones that are always last lmfaooo they deserve to lose anyways LMFAOo
As a Nigerian (one of our staple meals is noodles) I’m deeply ashamed of Olu especially after all the bragging she did. Like atarugu and cray fish go great in ramen but girl, did you even cook that shit!! I’ve never seen such dry and clumpy ramen in my life!
none of those look like how i make my ramen wow
ramen without water isn’t ramen…
Why are they straining their ramen like problem number one
bruh ramen supposed to have broth wtf is wrong with y’all
watery?? its called a broth!!!! oof!
Cheyennes ramen was the only one that looked like actual ramen. The other two had no soup in it why are they surprised with the soup???
Add hamburger meat to your ramen with the right kind of spices. You’re welcome.
Glad that I'm not alone in thinking that Oluwamayowa is really annoying. Like, how you gon' say yours is the best and get blown out of the water with the ratings.
The f**k is wrong with that Olu girl?
I’m happy she one all the other ppl where so disrespectful
The cheater girl shrug bcs urs  Loooks gross
You had to pick all black students huh?
there isn't even any broth, whatever that is its not ramen 😭
why sis embarrassing us Nigerians rn
R they really making them eat ramen with a spoon
“i prefer my ramen a little more dry” yeah that’s called mazemen not ramen dumb bitch stop tryna act like a chef ramen is originally always prepared with broth
I didn’t know people preferred RAMEN SOUP to be bone dry 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣 Acting like people are in the wrong here when they make it properly. Hers looked the best well deserved win!
They do NOT look like broke ppl tffff
Oluwamdjvieowoaocqa was not very humble at all. She got humbled tho🤣
i made alfredo ramen😅😂🤣
y they only put black kids 🙄
They should’ve just listened to her say ramen “Remen” that was dead giveaway lol
The Nigerian bugged out Ong lol she’s big headed from the start lol😂😂😂they clowned her shiiii 😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯
That wig looked legit 💪🏽💯
Who tf eats the ramen without the broth???
i cant be the only one who keeps the water ,please someone tell me they keep the water
Thats not how Nigerians cook noodles braaaa
Was Oluwamayowa planted? She's extremely rude, like I don't understand.
Bro Oly never pissed me off this much, it seems like she wasn't really broke in the first place and went out to eat all the time
RAMEN IS A SOUP WHY WERE THERE MORE DRY RAMENS THEN WET EXPLAIN YOURSELVES 😭🤚
Well her ramen did come with a different vibe ... Dry as hell
"we have re men"
**Looks at title*  **doesn’t see junior grimes name anywhere**  Me: **leaves dislike** 😊
I’m surprised junior Grimes wasn’t featured in this one lol
They’re all dry 😭
Why do they hate the broth. That's like half of the taste right there.
i just cook the noodles in water with the broth, and pour the water off and bake it for 10 seconds, so nice. oh and and 2 garlic cloves
Watching this while cooking some ramen😂
I been cooking ramen wrong I like mines wet with a egg, green onions, Louisiana hot sauce, with a cap full vinegar in it.
i swear olu was so confident about her ramen with all that boujee nasty flavours and ended up getting the lowest points bahah really got me ded lmfao,, now she for real for real broke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel like they all don't normally cook it liek that though, I dunno anyone who adds more then spices n maybe some butter(is that spice?) To they ramen
Also WHY DOES THE COLOUR OF THE RAMEN MATTER LIKE IT'S _FOOD_ WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE APPEARANCE IF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE BROKE?????
Why is Oluwamayowa gagging over ramen like this is ramen, not gourmet stuff. Don't expect it to be that fancy, it's literally stuff to eat when you cannot afford anything and comfort food I don't think most college students even add more stuff to what already comes in the packet/cup
"I don't like it at all... It's salty." That's called the seasoning packet honey.
Bro homegirl said she likes her ramen dry lmao sis ur ramen was dipped in the water and plated lol😂😂  I’m talking about the Nigerian student she was definitely the rudest and thiught to much of herself
None of them know how to make ramen
olu getting me tight don’t ever bring her on your channel again she’s rude asf
But why are they all eating with spoons though!🤔😅😂
ramen is supposed to have broth in it what are these people on eating completely dry ramen with a spoon
DuDE wtf ramen are watery there’s always soupe except for Samyang Korean noodles or fried noodles 🗿like wut
Did she just say rimin ?
Olu's noodles was giving very much rice vibes.
this isn't ramen, it's destroyed dry spaghetti
I've been making ramen since 8 this is just sad..      AND WHO EAT RAMEN WITH A SPOON?!
we can tell you like your ramen a little more dry girl
All these are horrible
The moment I saw the self-proclaimed ”African_Goddess” with her type A ”look at me I'm really awesome” personality. I immediately got terrible vibes. They all didn't seem like they ever even looked at where Ramen came from. It's almost as if they were stuck in their own cultures. Just all too black, and that Nigerian girl is probably just born and raised in America with only theoretical knowledge of Nigeria. You can't have dry ass Ramen. You need to make a broth. Not drained noodles with dry seasoning and some cheese or some shit.
All 3 of them don’t know how to cook
It looked cold 😖
this is ramen? where is the broth
3:58 😖😂😂
Little to no base just noodles, ate with spoon and  all looked like bland noodles.....   what in the world is this? I'm on that weird part of YT again. Never seen "Ramen" hack be worse than following back of the package until today
No white kids?
When they showed the cheetah girls ramen I cried 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 “ look it’s a clump “ and sometimes I like my ramen dry or wet 😂
i fucking hate olu
Don't know what was going on with Olu's ramen lol, but the chicken and shrimp additions made sense. I keep mine simple (and wet) with tapatio and lime. Salvadoran from Southern CA, so I know it's pretty common. How much water you use (Nissin Cup Noodles are my favorite), how hot it is *and* how long you "cook" it all come into to play. Adding some protein or veggies on the side or directly in it makes a huge difference. I still eat these on a regular basis not because I'm broke (although I am 😄), but because I actually like 'em. Stay safe and don't be afraid to play around with the ingredients ✌🏽😷.
These people are haters lol.
the winner was well deserved i make my ramen just ike her but a little more water, but the other girl😭 she a lil bit to confident
RAMEN IT SUPPOSED TO BE WATERY... IT'S SOUP!!!
Olu saying Cheyenne's ramen needs crayfish and that Nigerian spice reminds me of Cassandra looking for cinnamon and nutmeg at everything.
Where's the broth
Ramen supposed to have broth
It's the ones who always have a lot to say about someone's cooking but there's isn't even good 😂 (olu)
I LAUGHED SOOOOOOO HARD when they judged Olu! 🤣  When Olu was said, “I like my ramen DRYYY!” OBVIOUSLY!
I got confused on how she said it was too salty then proceeded to say he needed to season the ramen… “are you trying to kill me” but he needs to season the ramen?
They just suck at making ramen. 1 1/2 cup water 3 , 2min cycles in microwave and mix in between sets, ad seasoning mix and put back in mic for 35 sec.... edit let me cook these picky poop pockets real ramen
olu ( if i spelled it right) mam..... why do u have CHUNKSSS in ur noodles ?
Olu girl was mad annoying
“my ramen has a vibe”
The she said ramen messed with my Brain
I thought they were talking about mr. noodles 💀
That fact that I eating ramen is cool-
The thumbnail 😂
Y'all can't be so broke you cant afford water for y'alls ramen
If these people were held at gun point at told to make an Asian man some ramen and they present him with they made this video, He would put the gun down grab a water hose and blast them until they understood the concept of ramen.
Oh my god this video makes me feel like Gordon Ramsay
You sure these guys are broke?
3:06 I’m pretty sure this is going to win  3:11
Heres my recipe Sautee chopped ginger and garlic till golden brown  Add ramen and water  Empty most of the water when cooked  Put in a mix of the flavoring packet and japanese soy sauce  Enjoy
The 2nd girl is like the Wendy’s girl of this
Ramen is supposed to be soup. And that guy and girl did her dirty you can tell they loved it and they were jealous
their noodles look unseasoned sorry don't cancel me
I’m strange, I like my packaged cheap Ramen dry. I like my “real Ramen” with broth.
“A tsunami hit and this is the ramen that was left on the streets”  omg I can’t 😂🤣
I'm sorry to be mean, but Oluwamayowa is rude. "It doesn't have flavor, mine has flavor". 1st of all, don't be rude, 2nd of all, not everybody thinks your ramen is good, and 3rd of all, yours had the least rating, and it was a literal CHUNK. Don't be Ms. Big Brain.
the tittle was very rude ngl
“I prefer my ramen to be more dry” I can see as your ramen is hard as a rock.
DRY RAMEN? HELLOOOOO?!!
Gen X is too stupid "the ramen has water" yea its soup you idiot know it all kids. The Japanesse are the kings at Ramem hands down and theirs  usually have water its soup.
Gawd don’t give me dry ramen wtf. You don’t go to a ramen place doing that shi-
I’m glad that girl won because ramen is supposed to be soup, with the noddles just right! I hate when everyone eats dry ramen or when the noodles are just all soggy 🤮
Leftover chicken and teriyaki in ramen soup
This is disgusting
Uhh olu just shut up your so damn annoying 💀💀💀
Nobody gone say why they eating with a spoon
I think I would win if I was in the challenge
The 2 who said it was too watery aren't allowed in a ramen resto😩
They slow 😂 ramen is supposed to have broth!
What’s up with the other two not liking the ramen wet? I have my ramen swimming because I Iike to drink it at the end
3:33 i’m crying
Ramen is wheat noodles in broth, and they complain about the liquid?! Most of them were just noodles... I don't get why people just call every instant noodles "Ramen"... If there's not broth, is NOT Ramen
My question is why y’all eating ramen with spoons? 😂
I swear every time a high & mighty contestant comes on here and tries to flaunt that they're the shit, their SHIT is always the lowest rated one. That Olu girl irritated me with her "spices" and wtf were y'all complaining about there being liquid in the ramen?! My dude  it's RAMEN. It's supposed to have soup in there. Everyone's but Cheyenne's looked DRY as hell. And ole' Olu girl was complaining about how she like her ramen dry, like YEA GIRL we can fukin tell.....chile anyways so
Keyword is broke college students
He said more shrimp 😂😂😂 B-R-O-K-E !!!
It's always the one's who talk the most shit that end up losing. 🤣
‘It’s a bit watery’  Whose gonna tell them?
😭😭😭
"Its Salty like are u tryna kill me" help im dying lmao
Y’all don’t like the broth from the soup?
For a bunch of "broke" college kids they sure are acting like they had the opportunity to pick and choose LOL
Ramen is supposed to be soup so I don't understand why they're surprised there's water in it 😂
"Why is there so much water"  That, my friends, is called broth.
"they went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it!" COLDBLOODED
Im African American and how Oluwamayowa acted is kinda rude
How are any of these people broke? They all go to college.. very ungrateful of them.
They mentioned broke....they forgot the DUMB!!! HELL THEY DUMB!! Seriously....water???... that's how ramen supposed to be fool.
Afro sis need to shut up. her ramen was dry and dusty
Wait y’all don’t drink the broth?!?! I eat maruchan (shrimp is the best) with the broth add lime, onion, Valentina or Tapatío. BUSSIN
I LOVE HOW THE DISRESPECTFUL GIRL GOT THE WORST RATING- IM DEAD 💀💀
Bro, I don’t think they know that ramen is a soup…
Eat raw ramen and add that thing and smash it and put it in bag it taste good and you should make this as a snack for yourself or kids
NONE OF YALL WON TO ME YALL RAMEN UNCOLORED AND DRY BYEE
Lmao ayo keep yo abu seasoning
why they gotte be so extra dam like its just ramen
The first 2 noodles was looking pretty dry 🙅🏾‍♀️😹
Bro wtf they be eating where the fucking soup? Y'all are so American on god.
6:51 sore loser tactics
How the fuck aint you gonna like wet ramen when ramen a soup tho the fuck lmao
Its supposed to have water its not supposed to be dry wtf.
The guy is such a douche. Like all yall are broke so y are yall complaining so much🤨
Did she just say my mom Spanish 😂😂😂
5:37 what you mean LITTLE BIT MORE DRY! your raman has no flavor and just shit
“i would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” girl.... WE COULD TELL
Where the noodle juice
Bottom line none of them can make ramen
Man does nobody make it like soup
idk why in the video people think water in ramen is not good like it's fuckin ramen it has water and first 2 contestants dry ramen , i cannot even call it ramen
not to be rude or anything but why are all the contestants always black
Its soup
I can’t believe nobody used soy sauce! Lol.
So none of them have ever had actual ramen before?
The nigerian girl should have stayed broke, talking all that shii
Buzzfeed wanted to capture black views We still think you're trash
These folks complained about watery SOUP, y'all. IT. IS. SOUP.
Bro idk what Nigeria olu is from but we sure don’t make ramen like that💀
Is it me or y’all don’t feel sum type of way when they put “broke college kids”😂 like wtf
I love how cheynne is Afro Latina And has best taste when it comes to ramen, the others were great too, but Olu- was just straight up rude n annoying 🤦🏽‍♀️
“My momma told me if you don’t have some ing nice to say, don’t say anything at all”   Sis.. it’s a lil too late for that-💀
Olu be talking the most shiiii and lost💀💀
REMEN WHAT
cheyenne deserves it the others dont know how to make ramen
Damn they couldn’t afford the water for The broth. College struggles lol
Is that girl eating her ramen with a spoon and why doesn’t their ramen have soup?
that ladie talking all that mess but her ramen is trash seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
I forget sometimes that what I think ramen is and what the west thinks ramen is is completely different lmao
Oluwamayowa we are not making dried up indomi we are making ramennnnnnnnnnnn
As a Nigerian that eats the same food and seasoning as olu  And close to the same name we do not claim her
Cheyeene's ramen looks good
They calling it “water or watery” bruh it’s called soup-
Did anyone really think Nigerian food would compete.  No offense seriously but Nigerian food would be more of a need only cuisine, not something to want for
The fact that they gave them spoons to eat ramen of all things is... sad
Did anyone automatically get annoyed with olu? Lol
wheres the broth :(
They said it’s dry cause there ain’t no soup! Tf?
miss abcdefgaeiou is judging soo hard with this ramen of the worst dam rating
miss afro actin like she gordan ramsey up in here like ma'am yo dry a** noodles. no ma'am🙄
Cheyenne's ramen looks better than all of them lol😆😆😆😆😋😋😋
Who cares what the food looks like, bruh it's called struggle food for a reason. It's quick to make and affordable. The looks have nothing over the flavor. Plus, there's like no broth at all in their ramen, it's literally just noodles. They're eating it with a spoon too omg.
Please remember ramen is an Asian food.... Its a whole meal for them. An American ppl be trying to make it their own...
I don't think they passed college, they don't even know that ramen is a broth with noodles.
I understand they’re eating packaged ramen. But. They do realize ramen is a soup? Right?
Y’all ain’t seen broke til you ate that ramen with no water 🗣 you want crunch Olu?! There you go extra crispy😂😂😂
"the ramen is a bit watery.." GIRLY WHAT?? IS THAT NOT HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO BE??
Bro who ever that lady was she called Raman RAAMAAM
Its almost like the easiest way to add flavor is the broth. And not dumping an entire spice rack on some dry noodles
*It's Broth idiots and you bus boy its a budget meal not a buffet*
Why is she talking about color 😂😂😂😂 she went from saying it was good to eating it a 3. Hating much 😭
“These noodles look unflavored, no seasoning!!” Yes bc it is getting seasoned by the BROTH how traditional ramen is supposed to be lmao
wdym watery, ITS RAMEN ITS JUST DISGUSTING WHEN ITS DRY
you dont like the broth, you cant be hating on someone for doing it right. Its a soup😭😭😭LMAOOO
the cheetah girl is so disrespectful bye 💀 no how y’all sayinf it’s watery 😭 ITS RAMEN!!!
Why they so cocky and shady
1:39 “The ramen I used is maroon-chin” It’s MARU-CHAN not MaRoOn-cHiN💀💀💀        The disrespect 😭
These people dont even know what ramen is. Like seriously watch a Japanese video on it and educate yourself. Ramen is a soup that's why it's not a pasta
Bro the girl in the thumbnail looks like she just ate dirty muddy water xD like seriously your that pathetic you complain over ramen oh and the other girl tho xD it’s “ramen” not rAmeN xD and I swear there’s so many things wrong with this video xD and I’m pretty sure the only person to have some sense in this is that guy xD and a littlest rhe first girl but like by a fraction
I doing that on my instant ramen, first im crushing it in the bag and second putting the seasonings, that was good af
But why are they using a SPOON to eat ramen
I'm Korean and I'm officially inviting Olu to my kitchen for a ramen lesson lol
Isn't ramen supposed to come with broth anyway? Or is my japanese fantasy a lie? 😂
mannn they should’ve had an actual east asian person in the mix and see what those 2 annoying ones would’ve said about their ramen. and also…WHERE IS THE GARLIC ?!
Seriously if you can’t cook something as simple as instant ramen then stay out of the kitchen lol stuff like this gives REAL ramen a bad rap
Wtf do they not know ramen is a soup? Cheyenne is the only one that knows what’s up. I’d eat her ramen lol but seriously this is cringey to watch
there’s absolutely no way you gave these mfs spoons
I feel like Olu offers to put these two spices on everything anyone cooks.
Who eat ramen w a spoon.
miss cheetah print is complaining about everything when her ramen is CLUMPY & UNDERCOOKED .
Hello everyone, my name is omae wa mou shindeiru
The funniest thing about this is she said it’s too salty THE PACKET HAS SO MUCH SODIUM AND SALT WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING
Should’ve boiled an egg👌🏾 instantly would’ve won
Racist as fuck. No white people.
Lmaooo this was either verying annoying or very humbling for Oluwamayowa
“ew its salty” vs 2 secs later “literally the only thing w flavour is the chicken” 😭
Alternative title:College kids eat ramen using spoons
Olu literally no one cares about your spices girl😭😭, all you ever talk about is your spices..
After seeing all the comments I know I wasn't tripping, cuz I here wondering how is that there was no soup in their ramen. Like what?
Y’all cannot cook lol. But the chick with the Afro holy shit I’ve never seen ramen look so nasty in my life lol
The fact olu was such a picky ass woman yet her ramen was disgusting asf
This video made me so mad
We not gonna talk about them using spoons
A spoon😒
Cheetah girl is annoying. When she said “LiKe ARe yOu trYna KIlL mE” reminded me of a super stuck up parent rich girl.
What’s killing me is that they’re eating this with a spoon
Bro the girl in the black is the only one who can make Roman their is no way the other two think it is not supposed to have brought innit they do now it’s soup

And she said that she was going to win
Went from it’s to salty to is bad and dry🤓🤔
Bad🤣 you mean like urs
There’s no way Cheyenne is a broke college kid she put fing shrimp in it
How dont you talk about how the first girls name literaly a hole meme
The one who is talking the most whack got the worst rating lol
Ramen is ramen it’s supposed to have broth and soup in it- wbjsnsbzjzk 😭 and it’s NOT WATER if it has no “waTEr” it’s just- not ramen.
It is not being broke they just can’t cook no offense
Wait people eat dry ramen?
Remen
Why are all of the students bl- "Sees the description and channel name" Oh, nevermind, of almost all of them dont know what ramen is. Calling the broth water is an insult.

Every single one of these videos, the one talking the most crap has the lowest ratings
"There's not enough shrimp" sir this is a struggle meal.
Marcus hilarious
Here my ramen recipe btw :  a pack of cooked ramen  drain water out and put in a bowl  half tbsp pepper ,  1 tbsp sugar , 2 tbsp soysauce
All of them lose in my eyes cause that was just pitiful
my 10 year old brother can make better ramen than these LMAO
"My ramen is coming in with a different vibe, with a different TASTE"  *_Was the vibe making a shank in prison?_*
“its watery…” i cant believe there’s people that eat ramen dry🤦🏻‍♂️
Can we get a video of these people trying authentic ramen?  I just want to see if they're surprised that it's served in BROTH
Get an asian college student to make Ramen, see what happens....
“coming with a different vibe” LMAO
Yo that title is a violation 💀💀💀💀
Cheyenne know what she doin
They be complainin bout how watery the ramen is... ramwn supposed to have broth/soup  compared to there ramen which is dried would just be considered  noodles
6:43 that's all she cares about
Bro why they using spoons, most everyone uses forks or chopsticks not spoons
It got too much water.... ramen is supposed to have fucking broth I know they have never been to Japan but damn you can see on the package it has broth

Me who somethimes eats ramen raw: 🌚
“ I don’t like the water in the ramen it looks like “ like ramen that came from the street…..bro what? Fucc that guy
There not kids there grown adults
I REALLY REALLY wanted her reaction to her having the worst ramen and her being so critical.
And they became the best trio

“I prefer my Ramen a little bit more dry” yeah no shit
No broth or greens/flavour. I can barely call these ramen
See I'm not in college yet but when I make ramen I make it like it says it supposed to be made on the pack and then add a few seasonings and other things
Why the hell they eating ramen with a spoon?!?!
You’re supposed to leave the broth in the ramen 🌝
The girl that one deserved it!!. Like the boy did really good too, the other girl...... Um.... It was o. Ok? And yeah, I will def eat the winner ramen.
Olu is a hater. If Beyonce walked by she would say she was ugly. 2005 mean girl vibes. She didn't pass the check.
Shortie tweeking. It’s a struggle meal not a 5 star restaurant meal. And hers looks like some dry up cereal
I don’t know why but these videos are sooo so negative and passive aggressive. I don’t really like this whole negative vibe about them 👎

“What went wrong?”  “WDYM WHAT WENT WRONG? WHAT WENT WRONG IS THAT THEY WOKE UP AND MADE IT!”   I’m dead 😂😂🤣
“It’s too salty!” to “there’s no flavor”
Do they not know ramen is supposed to have broth… lol 😂
i’m only disliking the video because of OLU and the fact that only Cheyenne knows how to keep the ramen broth instead of draining it. bruh olu out here criticizing the ramen when hers is the least rated 💀💀🤡🤡
i hope they read these comments and realize how ridiculous they sounded
these mfs dont know how to make noodles (top ramen), the last girl had the best one . its a soup. theres supposed to be water, dry ramen wtf
Bruh, just boil the noodles, KEEP the water, salt pepper, maybe throw an egg in there, and boom.
that's not ramen without that broth, period. last girl 100% deserved the W
She prefers it super dry 😂 for sure lol talking about the wet ramen .

When they said “watery” and “no colour” I was like taste some of that WATER then because that has the taste
The cheetah girls Nigerian btw
Her: My ramen is the best period. No one got better ramen then me.  Everyone else: This shit dry as hell. Interviewer: What's wrong with it? Everyone: The fact that she woke up and made this.
Cheetah girl ramen looking like dandruff 💀
😂😂 THEYRE OVER HERE CRITICIZING AND JUDGING THE FOOD SO SERIOUSLY LIKE IF THEYRE JUDGES ON CHOPPED OR SOMETHING.

Oluwamayowa's gives me the quirky wannabe vibe 😂😂
As an Asian, this whole video is just painful to watch
idk why do they all eat ramen like this? even my worst struggle rame n looked way more appetizing than all of these. honestly kinda feel bad for them

Where are they getting these so called "ramen"? They've been eating this wrong the whole time.

Cheetah girl actin like she Gordon Ramsay
If I were to get on there and make my Roman I would get a 10 😭
Not them going out of their way to be as critical and rude as possible damn they rlly had no intentions of trying new things or being open minded at all
Isn’t ramen supposed to have……broth……..
Cheyenne ramen was literally just regular ramen
…isn’t ramen SUPPOSED to have broth? 😂😂 I’ve never had a dry ramen in my life.
Ramen 🍜 is definitely not supposed to be "dry" you're not supposed to really drain all the water out... I mean you can but then that's not really ramen... and I don't eat ramen noodles but if I made some I'm not draining the water all the way out.
why do they have to be broke dumbass channel
"they went wrong by waking up and decided to make it" king shit😭😭🔥👏
Honestly I’m black/Asian , but ramen is a Japanese dish . Sooooooo why didn’t they get Asians in this Ramen challenge ?? Cause I hook my ramen UP
I’ve never in my life heard someone say “ram-en”
So embarrassing for Olu
Omg ramen is a noodle soup lol  The package has instructions on the back 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's broth she did amazing stop messing with her
Why are they eating with spoons
bruh I make a separate broth, add seared garlic, ginger, onions, some soy sauce, sesme oil, my moma sent me some of her blended spices so I add that, the flavor packet, the flavoring oil. (I buy indome noodles, I ate them as a kid) then I add the noodles to cook inside the broth. I squeeze In a lime, add chopped green onion, and add cilantro. then a squeeze of Sriracha. gas ash, and cheap wit that ebt yfm😭😭
As an Asian i'm so 😟 like wheres the broth????
As a representative of the Asian community, we all feel attacked when they thought the ramen with soup is poopoo as if they cooked their ramen right, but theirs like noodles from the desert wtf
da boi just cut the ramen and it made me krezi af 6:36
Your moms Spanish huh you mean Mexican

No way this is real 🤣 how embarrassing
Me who floods my ramen in water and after drinks all the leftover broth…. 🧍‍♀️
why are their ramen dry as fawk like it should have broth. wdym by "watery" giRLLLL im ded
I ain’t gone lie, but I dated a Nigerian several years ago and he threw down on his noodles and he’d boil an egg to add on the side.  Ooooo Lord, but now I’m married to a Jamaican and his Noodle are okay, but his food is amazing 🥰   Edit: they’re complaining about the broth 😳, I don’t want no damn brothless noodles 🍜
5:36 ramen is a soup type dafaq ya'll talkin about
ramen lives matter
Some advice to miss cheetah print, don’t go to Japan 🇯🇵, all the ramen chefs gon jump you 😭
There's no way people make dry ramen, I'm sure they faked that for more comments or something.
“Broke” my life story 😭
5:38 Sis… they know.
getting some nationalism vibes damn
ramen is a SOUP. as a blasian person, i cannot STAND black folk like this. and the chick saying it seemed unflavored,, THAT'S BC THE FLAVOR IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE BROTH. and her "ramen" was mad fuckin dry. they should just call that shit noodles.
I haven’t watched the video yet but do they know their there because their getting called broke?
The ramen is a bit WATERY
This is kafkaesque.
girl idk what the deal is u would be inhaling that into my lungs like oxygen
girly ramen supposed to have water gosh
the cheetah print girl is giving me negative vibes yk 😭 like while she's tasting others ramen she still talks about hers
Anyone who wanna be adventurous... try ya ramen with Valentina hot sauce , 1 Diablo tacobell sauce 2 if you dangerous , add some lemon/lime juice add chicken or any day old leftover meat 🍖 😋 to make a struggle plate ...u truly have to struggle 😂😂😂
By the looks of it all of those bowls of ramen look nasty asf and dry.
She was so picky then got a 0 she gotta stfu lmao
Gave them spoons to eat noodles
these people eat ramen with a spoon while they eat rice with forks lol
Omg the boy and the olu girl can't cook 😭for nothing both of there ramen are dry ‼️
1:40 ✨maroochin ✨
I’m sorry….but do they not know what Broth is I- ☠️ “water” ☠️☠️☠️
The only thing that’s actually wrong with this video is that they are using SPOONS  like wtffff
“I’d prefer my ramen a little bit more dry”… girl you’d prefer it uncooked 💀
Ok I get that they don't like the water some people don't but.....I can't be the only one triggered by the spoon....I can't
This reminds me of that one time my dad removed the broth from the ramen. Thankfully he didn't add the seasoning until after he removed the water. It tasted good, but an epic fail lmao
There's no white people, this is racist and I demand the entire team be fired and their lives' destroyed
so we not keeping the broth ? smh
5:52 THE MUSIC STOP TOOK ME OUT
They say that like there’s another type of college student lol
THEY LIKE THEIR RAMEN DRY ? 😭😭oh god
When they asked why there was broth in ramen, it's like asking where is there cheese on pizza. Ramen is supposed to have broth. Sure there are dry ramen, but the quintessential ramen has broth. 2/3 of these kids shouldn't have a say about ramen cause they don't know the first thing about it.
She said it was salty and then she said seasons it
So what I've learned today is a 13 year old can cook better than full grown adults. 😟
The Chita shirt girl is annoying wtf how does ramen have Color lmaoooooooo and plus dry ramen they good???? You supposed to have the broth with it wtf😭
Marcus and Olu doing too much

my ramen fs would have won
Lol SORRY HUT ALL OF THESE RAMENS ARE TRASH
None of these are ramen  so plain
“A bit more dry” A LOT MORE DRY GIRL
I put spaghetti sauce in my ramen its good! Not even kidding
Don't coleges have food programs so...
Cheetah print girl is so critical yet hers was the worst 😭😭😭 like it’s not meant to be dryyy Cheyenne did everything right
Do these kids even know what ramen is ? I've never seen such unappetizing ramen bowls in my life.
Why are the ramens cut out😟
Me looking for the soup 👁👄👁
2 things:  I thought everyone ate ramen with liquid....and with a FORK.    Edited: 1 more thing: why are Black people so hard on each other.  Dayum.

"Water"  😟 A HATE CRIME THAT'S A WHOLE ASS HATE CRIME
ramen is a soup 💀 there ramen was dry af, the last girls ramen was the only one that looked good
As an Asian I find it really really offending. Yall don't deserve our Ramen/Instant Noodles, I'm looking at you cheetah girl
Y'all don't know how to make ramen except the girl with the ponytail smh
Olu was a bitch bruh
Cheetah print girl just embarrassed herself
Omg. I NEED broth in my ramen! I don't understand how anyone likes to eat it without the damn broth!

“It’s too watery” it’s called broth if you don’t like it eat dry spaghetti
When I feel fancy. I make my ramen with some boiled eggs on the side and chopped tomato in it as well with some lemon and taptio. Bomb bro.
WHO THE FUCK EATS RAMEN DRY?? EWWWW

I’m confused cause I thought soup had broth in it
the curly dude talkin bout cheetah print girls ramen, serves her right. "look, it's a clump," now i like him but its funny so imma say it, like yo hair. HAHAHAH
Y dont they have the broth?
Dammmmm Why Yall Had To Say “Broke College Kids”
Water…. That’s what it’s supposed to look like !!everybody else’s was dry. I ain’t ever seen no dry ramen like that before.
The chopstick budget must have also been struggling 😩 why are they eating noodles with a spoon lmao
“It’s salty you tryna kill me?” “season the ramen! It matters!” Girl if you dont
I knew shawty with the cheetah shirt was gon be the worst on off the rip
Yeo the one who have the worst to say always have the nastiest looking food 😂😂😂🥲
Yall.   ramen /ˈrɑːmɛn/ noun plural noun: ramen (in Japanese cuisine) quick-cooking noodles, typically served in a *broth* with meat and vegetables.

Olu be like:  "It's too dry."  Gets to the last one:  "I like my ramen a little more dry."  Dis bitch

The way how she said ramen-
Damn why do so many Americans est their Ramen with no broth? It makes it 10x better

Imagine your ramen being your personality trait but everyone hates it
It’s the dry ass noodles with the Nigerian confidence for me. And who’s ramen doesn’t have broth.
Hmm
Ramen 🍜 best with broth
Who would have guessed that the girl who cooked the ramen properly and left the broth in which is literally the main source of the flavor had the best one out of the three, I’m literally not surprised.
Alternative title: The cheetah print girl explaining why she's better than everyone else but failing anyway for 7 minutes
also the cheetah girl who swore she would win got a 2 damn-
the fact the one dude had something to say and only had salt a chicken-
Cheetah girl said the third one is good but gives it a 3 😂 the shade lol I can tell she’s prob toxic
Ramen is supposed to be soupy?!?!?!

first of all, WHY ISNT THERE ANY SOUP ON THE BOY AND CHEETAH PRINT GIRL'S BOWLS, second of all, WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON, third of all, WHO IN THE HELL WOULD EAT COLD RAMEN, YOU COULD JUST TELL ITS COLD
as an asian- **yall** - what the hel- "the ramen's a little bit watery" yall never heard of ramen with soup or something the second was literally ruined ramen the rest is ok-
Okay. But the way Marcus said "Maruchan" made me angry.
atp when they show clips of someone overhyping their food at the beginning,  I just know they are gonna get the lowest rating😭😭
olu talked all that shit and got an overall 2😹😹
I’m sorry Bt I don’t know how y’all like y’all ramen DRY like the Sahara desert🏜😬at least give it some moisture and ramen is not suppose to be dry Cheyenne was the only better one!!!!😭
They don’t put broth in their ramen?!?

The girl in the cheetah print adds crayons to her ramen... cuz then hers has "colour"...
Asians watching this: 🤦🏻‍♂️

The girl in the cheetah print made me mad she was like “his is a lil dry and I don’t like it” girl didn’t you just say you liked your ramen dry and it’s in clumps like come on now
the one w the worst dish always got the most to say LMAOO
If I was rich I would eat Ramon in college
It's salty but the only thing with flavor is the chicken?🤔
Those things look so raww those aren't even done
Never fails that the one who talks the most crap gets lowest score
She can do the science but the cooking ain’t it sis
My ramens gonna win. Hell nah
Because all the broke college students can afford shrimp? :P
Is it salty? It’s ramen
Why are they eating it with a spoon
WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITHOUT BROTH............ like yall are eating RAMEN not dry noodles
Bro broth is the ramen like wtf where is the broth the last girl was the most acceptable
The real question is why is there no broth
Why are they using spoons
what is this … I hope and pray this is staged
My name is ...... Wtf she say
Her mom is Spanish? Like from Spain?
Olu  hyping up her Ramen and that shii DRY ASF.
Ramen without BROTH ain't no ramen in my humble opinion
All the ramen looks nasty as hell. Y’all are not that broke.

"It's a bit watery. I like mine a bit dry."  Ma'am your ramen isn't even dry, it's a whole ass desert. 😭🤚
spoon and ramen?????? WHATTTTTT!!!!!!
Why does Marcus remind me of author💀👌🏾
Ngl cheetah shirt girl looks bratty as hell 😭
i don't think they heard of soup based ramen
that cheetah print girl must be fun at parties...
do y’all not kno what broth is pls
ramen is supposed to have soup/broth…. tf why are they eating ramen dry?!
"You have to pay for parking" what? if you have a car, you aint broke.
The winner was well deserved. She was honest and respectful unlike the others I wanted her to win sooo bad and I also wanted to try hers too 💀💀
They're definitely not broke
Yo cheetah print girl and the boy mad annoying try it before u talk like damn
Olu should stay humble cause her’s looked disgusting 😭marcus’ wasn’t too bad ig but seemed like it was missing moisture and cheyenne’s seemed most edible imo BuT they’re all missing (most of )the broth 😭 and where is the color 😭 they all looked bland tbh
Alternate Title: 1 broke college student with a superiority complex and disgusting doesn’t understand what ramen is
The fact that there's no broth ...... hate crime
thats embarassing olu was criticizing his ramen so hard just to get a 2 😭😂
How the girl in cheetah print talk so much crap bout their ramen but hers was the nastiest and driest but as soon as she was talking crap I knew here’s was the worst😂😂
5:39 really?!??! never could have guessed that
i see no one sayin it but the leopard print girl was straight up ANNOYING
The second one is dry as fuck sorry for causing the second one is dry as hell it's sad they have to eat that shit sorry.
The girl in the cheetah want her noodle rainbow
Had to dislike the video... the cheetah bitch was pretentious as hell and 2/3 of these "soups" HAD NO BROTH....  And none of these "broke" college students thought to go to the grocery store and pick up some veggies/seasoning.... but one of them could afford shrimp. Green onion, egg, hot sauce, actually having broth, etc.... try it sometime.
Cheetah print was hating talking bout hers good girl them noodles was dry and stuck together😂😂
I absolutely hate when a contestant is obviously biased instead of not actually liking it so they giving lower ratings so they can win so I love when they lose
Me watching this while eating my own ramen invention haha
Alright do you guys keep the broth in or drain it
Bruh I take the broth out of the ramen but it ain't never THAT dry 🤣
This is how I eat my ramen Ramen noodles  Cooked Shrimp Diced pepper Diced onion Scrambled egg Soy sauce   Heat half cup of water in microwave for 3 minutes Place noodles in bowl crushed or hole Add green peppers and onions to dry noodles Poor microwaved water over noodles and cover with lid Let' stand 5 minutes Drain all water but place in a cup to the side Add cooked shrimp and two scrambled eggs with noodles Add half packet of ramen seasoning in noodles Add remaining ramen seasoning in water that was drained earlier from the noodles Add half teaspoon soy sauce to noodles If you a person that likes broth in your noodles add as much ramen seasoned broth to the noodles Microwave one last time for 30 seconds Do not overcook noodles noodles will become really squishy noodle should be firm but not hard and able to stick to the wall I've been eating it this way all my life don't knock it till you try it
Do people really not eat it as a soup
POV: you called noodles ramen.
cheyenne if ur reading this girl. you did everything right LMAOOO like they say “watery?” babes…. it’s broth YOU MADE SOUP AS YOUR SUPPOSED TOOOOOO THEY MADE NOODLES
Why they have to say broke tho 😭😭😭
olu probably cried home after this 😭😭
The jaguar shirt girl sound so freakin annoying

Hjfxvh
Ramen is ramen.
Am I tripping or does ramen typically have broth cuz to me the first two were dry af (also they said water idk what they on about)
“The ramen is a bit watery” girl… yours was just a lump.😭
if it didn't have water it'd be better but who doesn't pour out the water like ew.
I’ve watch enough of these videos to know it’s always the ones with the big mouths who can’t cook for shiiiit!!
He had every reason to complain

Olumayowahbckxdghn: "I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry"  we know, you like your ramen drier than the Sahara according to the other contestants
WHERE IS THE BROTH
WHY ARE THEY USING A SPOON 🥄
Oh hell na- ramen is not supposed to be so dry and clumpy.
Never before have I seen such badly made ramen, its pain`
6:50 well at least they tried
The water has no color ...it's broth and does it matter 😑
Ramen is supposed to be a soup..this is all gross
They're all lieing
2:24 it needs flavour 2:04 its too salty LIKE GIRL WHAT

They tryna act all professional, but they’re literally just eating packed ramen

The Cheetah girl’s  Raman is more dry Then the Pop Eyes biscuit

I want water in my noodles what’s wrong with y’all
The African girls ramen looked disgusting
“I would like my ramen a bit dry” ma’am.. You could eat ur ramen as chips😭

Miss cheetah girl needs to stfu,on her insta she’s now obsessed with asians😭😭😭😭😭
Who eats ramen without the broth
the girl in the cheetah print taking this a lil too seriously...
I like my ramen dry 😂💀 wtf
yall be eating nasty ass ramen all dry. yall really ate that shit everyday in college? how are yall not dead?
I can out cook all of you guy the don’t look cooked at all,But I like Marcus,and Cheyenne
Flour + water + elbow grease= Real macaroni. It's so much better than ramen from the store.
None of them had broth except for the last girl lol they tripping bro u gotta use the seasoning it comes with and add a boiled egg and sum fresh jalapeños y’all don’t know the deal and I ain’t even go to college I just be high 😂
Yo was sup with the shawty with the poofy hair so fire
This isn’t buzzfeed
how tf all of em dry...
Wait there's people out there that like to eat their ramen that dry? Where the hell is the SOUP dude 😭Cheyenne the only one that did anything right
“Mines is gonna win” she literally lost so hard
The girl with the cheeta print was the biggest hater with the most musty ramen lol
Somebody please give these people an actual bowl of ramen or at Least show them a picture 😭😭
Cheetah print so damn boujee and can’t cook😂😂
Do they not know ramen is meant to be with the broth right…? Like tf yall might aswell buy plain spaghetti
They clearly don’t drink the broth after they finish the noodles ✋😐
theres supposed to be broth in a mf ramen and who tf uses a spoon to eat ramen wtf use mf chopsticks or a fork
Olu: it has water in it.... I prefer mines dry Everyone: we know sis
Did they just throw away the instructions on the insta ramen packet? This is so painful to watch.
Damn cheetah print’s “ramen” (didn’t even have the damn broth) might be more dryer than the Popeyes’ biscuit on god.
Olu talked all that trash and as per usual 😂
Ok but why do I feel like I could do way better than all 3 of them combined when I am a literal 13 year old. Like my ramen usually don’t have broth so it is a noodle but it’s not dry, the noodles still have moisture unlike cheetah girl, my ramen has color to it, unlike all of them lol. And it tastes good and has a good flavor as well. It’s got a little spice but nothing overwhelming. Like-
Where do they find these people? Who the hell doesn’t put broth with the ramen.? Instant ramen usually has broth at least a little then other two was eating dry crunchy chips.😭
olu is dumb she says her ramen is the best but she got a 2  !!
Are we just going to ignore the fact they are eating whit spoons to eat the ramen
It’s always the most conceded one that food be actually nasty
They forget what actual ramen looks like. “I like my ramen dry” she said
Stay humble
5:37 yeah.. we can tell
2:05 “It’s salty!”…bro it’s instant ramen 🤣
That’s not even ramen that’s dry noodles… at least the one who won deserved it for the broth and sriracha 👏🏼
First y r they eating ramen with a spoon second do these ppl not know that ramen is supposed to be soft and have broth?
“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry”  .. we noticed sis💀
Naw the bitch in cheetah print was boogie asf that it was annoying
cheetah print girl just wanted to win fr
Who eats ramen with a spoon....... NOT ME I EAT MY RAMEN WITH A FORK
bro the ramen can have broth is optional its not water and dry noodles are stirfry noodles macus is cool still doesn't know how to cook ramen cheynne props for that good looking ramen and oluwamayowa im sorry but ur ramen is trash and im asian btw
The afro girl was just trying to get her rating up lmao
Tf they mean water... its fucking ramen bruhh
All their ramen looks so nasty 🤮

Bruh you ain’t really alive until you try Asian grandma’s ramen
So none of these people like there ramen with water and the seasoning?? I use to eat my ramen dry, and now I laugh because I love it with the seasoned watered, then again these are their own recipes so I have to give them props
These comments are giving micro aggression
You’re otagum is gonna make the ramen dry
i give this a three 😒 ... next 😇 ( video ends )
There isn't anything wrong with a brothy ramen. People need to grow up.
Omg just go to the dollar store they have food
Heyy @coacobutter how can I be on this ? 😍🙂
Bro do they not know that ramen had BROTH in it?!?!? Like wtf?? Everyone of these hurt me except the last one. The last one was acceptable and if we got to see like the whole pot or a bowl with more broth, I think it would look rly good. When I saw they ain't have no broth in their noodles I thought it was like eating the dry raw ramen with the seasoning packet, which is like the best snack ever. But boy was I wrong.
She got the same last name as me "Washington"💯
the worst part is that they eat ramen with a spoon
Oluwamayowa…girl…she a bit rude when her ramen is bad 😭
I wonder if cheetah girl has actually eaten real ramen and understands that, that shit is broth lmfao
First off eating it with a spoon 🤦🏾‍♂️
I stay in bpt tooo
Why are they eating it with a spoon
I prefer my ramen with broth.
Olu is just to much bruh she talking so much but hers is so dry
Cheetah girl how the Tik Tok go “ YOU THOUGHT YOU ATE THAT” 😂😂 this why I’m always humble so if I get embarrassed folks can at least say she a good person
In case yall dont know, eating too much ramen isnt good for you. Do ur research & you'll see why.
Idk y th cheetah print girl is over
Ramen has soup. Seriously, like im i just cant. Like i cant even. 🤯
... why do ppl make ramen with no broth... its supposed to have soup smh
since when did we start pourin all the soup out, like who tf eatin dry ramen noodles
Omg....why are they complaining about ramen being watery?! It's ramen....IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH 🗣
I make my ramen as thus: Cook it with the broth until super soft, add milk, soy sauce and red pepper flakes to make it spicy, then poach an egg in it and it hits the spot for me.
Remem
how she say Marcus ramen was too salty then says where is the flavor?
Literally my first time seeing anyone eat ramen with a spoon
😂😂😂😂😂
Traditional ramen has broth…. How these “broke college kids” affording chicken and shrimp????
"Its salty" Bruh Ramen is literally 95 percent sodium.
I love how they all hated eachothers ramen soooo much then hyped their own
I used to make other pasta dishes with ramen like spaghetti basically drain the water you boil it in dont use the packet of seasoning and make spaghetti sauce and you get the rest shrimp Alfredo ramen I might make next
Pleaseee i literally only liked Cheyenne ramen-
Oluwamayowa was fronting she new Cheyenne's was good
Toxic people fall on their face always
So only broke College kids are black now
the girl who won is the only one who knows anything about ramen lmaooo
Glad cheyenne won she was the only one that made it correctly 😐
Bruh the girl who lost really tried to rig it so she would win like giving no higher than a 3? Huhhhh hers didn’t even have anything but uncooked noodles lmao. She def didn’t wanna give any high scores just to have a slight chance at winning with the other judges actually being fair… karma lol
Why are they using spoons 😭
BROTH!
The fact theyre eating ramen with spoons is offensive
Does Cheetah only know 2 ingredients she fails to mention anything else
I aint a broke college kid but a high school graduate and aint none of these fools touching my ramen.
Why are they eating this with a spoon though!??? 🤨😭😭
PLEASE THEM CALLING THE BROTH WATER??? ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH 😭😭😭
Lmaoooo everyone calling her the cheetah girl
oluwamayowa is sooo beautiful wowww
Everything about this episode was just WRONG!
Hoowwwww so whack??? MORE TO THE POINT.. who tf gave them a spoon to eat ramen 😬😬☠️
THE BROTH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. ONLY THE LAST PERSON HAD BROTH.
Anyone else just eats it dry like a snack bar. Like uncooked if you do cook it leave the broth that’s the best part.
I can already hear Asian chef rages...
They are not broke they are rich this is fake I do y like tr
"I would prefer my Ramen a little bit more dry." *we can tell*
bruhhhh it be the ones that be talking the most trash that be having the worst ones💀.
Is she eating Roman with a 🥄
Bitch a struggle mean is a singular package of Ramen with MAYBE an egg in it.
Hello my name is *OVAIWALAGDLSVDPVBA* also this girl was a brat
The ramen juice is the best part…..
She litterally said it was to salty than right after she said it had no flavor wtf ?
2:00 first is salty then later on its not seasoned?
y’all realize authentic ramen has “water” (broth) right?… americans smh.LMAO
Not even a minute into this video and cheetah print already annoyed me 💀
Cheetah print girl needs to chill, the water comment had me dead because girl it's ramen.... There's suppose to be a little broth in there 😭🙈😂
My girl ramen said 🏜️🦂🐪 😭😭😭😭😭
where is the broth tho
I would have asked for a fork first
“i don’t like the water” shut up you might aswell call the food noodles not ramen💀
Him: eww this looks flooded  Also him: wait I said too much it actually tastes good
These people are crazy ramen is suppose too have broth liquid wtf y’all eating shit basically 😂😂😂
I’m not even in college and got no money but I can make a wayyyy better ramen than all of em 😂😂😂
Hmmm how interesting broke college students…so you calling all black college students broke? WOW
The vibe I'm getting most from this isn't 3 broke college kids, it's 3 college kids who dead ass don't know how to cook. I mean, I suppose that's why you fall back on ramen in the first place, because if you're slipping SHRIMP in there, you aint broke.
Cheetah print girl ramen didnt look edible AT ALL im sorry not sorry i wouldve eaten the other two though there’s sounded good
I’m 15, Asian and even at 15 I just…sometimes violence is the only option.
This isn’t realistic, no broke person eats their ramen out of a bowl, we use the cup it comes in
"i was so broke , i cant fathom how broke i was" what?
Why are they using a spoon?
The girl in the cheetah print outfit how do you mess up noodles like put the noodles in a bowl you heat it up why is your clocks I should slap you
ramen is supposed to have broth 😭
I just put a fried egg siracha soy sauce and half the seasoning pack
If you don’t get your clown hair owowa sang bully joe locking ass talking bout it to salty are trying to kill me
I’m 9 and I cook better ramen
do they realize ramen has liquid in it? it's not supposed to be noodles lmao
why tf they eating noodles with a spoon 😐
These people be acting like ramen isnt a type of Noodle soup, like it is literally supposed to have broth in it. its a SOUP
My ramen has flavor mine is gonna win her ramen:🪨🌵
Im sorry.. Me being asian is just like...Yall eat your ramen...dry?
Bruh isn't traditional Ramen supposed to be soupy? wtf is up with gaijin & "dry ramen"
Absolute eggheads on here who are shit cooks, the sheer laziness in these meals was ridiculous.
Cant we just talk about how they're using a spoon instead of a fork to eat ramen 😃
Where in the fuck is the broth how the fuck you gonna make Ramen with no broth
All of there ramen looks nasty af
This ain't broke ramen, this is "I am lazy and don't know how to cook" ramen. There is no reason you can't spice this up with a couple veggies, a little protein, etc...
Why tf these ramens look like doggy doo doo like I swear I can make cup noodles and it looks better. IDK if it tastes the same but the ramen on this video looks depressed holy
Who eats DRY ramen, there’s even a bowl with broth on the package, 😭 get them 2 outta here
Who eats ramen with a spoon????? Oh my God
Who eats dry ramen 🍜 ewww the winter deserve her win lol the others are a big no for me I hate dry mushy ramen
should of definitely only had men on this video. girls can find a simp to bring them free food and weed right to there door 24/7 and not even have to give up any ass 😂
Bro i just realised they usin' fucking *SPOONS* to eat ramen WHAT.
eats ramen with a spoon, but has no broth with the noodles: 🤡
Yas shout out to the shrimps that saved the day-🦐
She rlly said ramen like RAAAAAAAH-men.
Who doesn’t like the “water” in it🤨
Why was olu even invited on the show, I’m sure someone taste tasted or seen whatever it was that she served before the show.
The real question is WHY ARE THEY EATING NOODLES WITH SPOONS THERE IS NO BROTH
Who else is getting pissed off at the cheetah girl its like she trynna be rude.
i wanna know why no one asked why they are eating ramen with a spoon.
Ramen isn’t supposed to be dry it should have broth
Flavorful broth is a must not salty but flavorful and a kick of spice and maybe some other things. Dry is  not always too good 😏😏😏🤣🤣😂 wet=better
"Its so salty are you trying to kill me?"  Also said "The only thing with flavor here is the chicken. SEASON the RAMEN."
Her season the ramen   also her  its so salty are you trying to kill me😑
What way she said “ uhhh you trying to kill me “😂
My Nigerian sister 🥰❤️
cheetah print girl annoying asf
Oluwamayowa mou SHINDERU!
I have never been so disappointed before...  Well it's time for me to touch grass.
The one girl says the first ramen is so salty "what are you trying to kill me" then 2 seconds later says it has no flavor and the noodles are not seasoned
I love how the instructions at 0:52 say they were instructed to each bring their "homemade" ramen. Lol instant ramen can be dressed up but they will NEVER fall into the homemade catergory
Olu: there is no color   Her ramen: 🌚
This is wackasaurus rex
5:38 oh yea we can see that💀
People talking so much shit shorty with the shrimp and the water in your soup 🤔 lol broth maybe wow humans
No wonder why yall are broke , u eating ramen with spoon
How is Olu gonna say it’s pretty good. And, then give it a 3.5. I don’t get people. Get people who enjoy food and don’t want to just be shady. I’ve never seen anyone give a grade higher than a 7
Drop your ramen recipes?   I make mine with seasoned salt, Curry powder and beef slices
Ngl the girl with the cheetah print she… is a want to be food critic to say the least and thinks her food is the best there is like almost every single food critic
I love they had to say they are BROKE in the name 🤣
3:08 “I’m pretty sure this is gonna win. Bring it on” *6 seconds later*          *THIS SHIT DRY AS HELL*
I wish I was in the challenge, I would’ve killed it even though I’m in middle school & not college. 😭👌🏽
I'm just saying. I eat my ramen by boiling it with water, throwing in the flavor packet and adding an egg. THAT is a struggle meal done well. These guys add so much extra stuff I just can't. And also their comments were so weird like it doesn't have color, needs more/less seasoning. It's a struggle meal dude not fancy food calm down...
As an Asian this hurts to watch
I’m black and this video hurt my soul. There’s so many things wrong. WHY ARE THEY EATING WITH A SPOON. WHY IS THE CHEETAH GIRL TALKING WHEN HER RAMEN LOOKS LIKE THE SAHARA DESERT.MARCUS’S RAMEN WAS NASTY LOOKING TOO. THE ONLY GOOD ONE WAS CHEYENNE SHE ACTUALLY COOKED SOME RAMEN NOODLES. I don’t like shrimp but hers should be a 7 or higher
oh my gosh the cheetah print girl needs to stfu
Bro, what she mean it’s too watery? It’s ramen not lo mien(sorry if I butchered that spelling) and even that isn’t that dryer noodles looked like she just let them sop up and get sticky after draining😭😭
I love she said accessory like assessory
WHY THE FUCK THEY ARE EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON??????????????????
Am I the only one who noticed that they used spoons to eat the ramen
Cheyanne is so gorgeous oh my gosh
“Look it’s a clump” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i might die today form who dog shit the cooked the ramen
The cheetah-print girl was getting on my nerves, even though I was trying to focus on the other people. By looks of the comments I’m not the only one.
the cheetah girl is way to invested on this ramen like lady its not supposed to be a 5 star meal
A shrimp*
A spoon?????
I put butter , shrimp , Goya , shrimp seasoning , Creole seasoning , a little bit of soy sauce .
All of yalls ramen r weird and dry mine is so good and I'm only 14 so.
All of them look disgusting
I just startedctge vid wtf is wrong with tge olu girl i hate her and her ramen vibe
Ramen is plain noodles, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? IT TO TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE CAKE OR SOMETHIN
Why are they all African American and they made the eat noodles
Do people eat ramen with a spoon????
“My moms Spanish so this gives me Spanish vibes” girl… dont you mean Mexican vibes…? 💀
Y’all all lose points for eating that shit with a spoon.
Bruh they calling the broth water like that’s how you supposed to eat it it not like dry mush
Why are they using a spoon
Ramen is salty
Cheetah girl: Why's it so salty? Also cheetah girl: tHis hAs nO flaVoR
first off. WHY ARE THEY EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON!? WHO RAISED THEM??
That ata gungun need a bath
“mine actually has flavor mine actually has taste” the taste: ☀️🌵🏜🐪
Are they eating it with a spoon😂
I would've dumped broth on the girls lap and ask her what I dumped on her lap, to know if she knows what broth is
Why wouldnt you want broth?  To the girl that likes it dry, you might as well just pam fry them
why are they saying cheyanne’s ramen is watery ? 😭 it’s not even watery bc it’s supposed be soup 😭😭
It seems like they are eating it cold after it had been sitting out while they were getting production ready. Unless each person freshly made the dishes in between takes.  Ramen is best RIGHT RIGHT when it's still hot and at least keep a little broth, not drain it completely.
I like eggs, green peppers, lemon pepper.
istg this shit is always staged. There's always that one contestant that has an attitude when judging everyone else's food and then has the worst dish.
I add hot sauce soy sauce and soft boiled egg
Cheetah girl: my ramen coming in with a different vibe Marcus literally 5 seconds later: this shit look dry as hell😂😂
that girl, olu was so annoying OMG!
I feel like people are unnecessarily mean in these videos 👀
olu is deffo gonna be either the rich auntie that everyone lobes or the one everyone hates
Of course they censor black with broke... white people can be broke too, my white ass can barely afford rent
The leopard print girl d be like pick me girl and Emily at once doe
Likeeee r u tryiiiiinggg to kiiill me
They’re eating it with spoons😰
Mannn I woulda killed dis on my soul
sis really said hers would be so good and was hating on marcus but hers was just- nobody even wanted to eat it
Olu is a straight up hater she’s just mad cuz her ramen was clumped up
....im sorry but "could give it some color" its instant ramen what you expecting like 2 michelin star ramen or some shit
Uh I’m Asian and this pisses me off that they don’t eat with chopsticks or why the very least a fork and that there is no fwacking soup in RAMEN
the cheetah girl acts like she is a professional chef when her noodles look like worms
cheetah girl: I need to make sure I’m not eating anything bad Her ramen: *ramen bubble gum*
cheetah girl: THIS ISNT GOOD me: alright Gordon Ramsey
She just said it was salty then says it’s dry
In college I was making 1370/ week y’all doing something wrong
COLOR WTF
ramen is not suppose to be dry
I just ate my ramen and yall can’t just cook the ramen all the way and then put hot Cheetos/takes/hot fries. Then add Valentina or any other hot sauce y’all want and boom there u go bomb ass ramen
cheyenne the only one that knows about broth
ramen is supposed to have water.. also where’s the flavor packet
Yo cheetah girl irks me and she is so rude and hers looked nashty 🤢🤮
lmao the cheetah print girl's ramen looks like sand lmao
I drain most of the water...not all, season packet, add butter and pepper.   We all have our preference.
You know for ya'll to be "BROKE" college students, ya'll sure got money for shrimp, chicken, and all these extra fancy-sounding seasonings lls
What do you mean "watery" ramens SUPPOSED to have broth.
I love a lil juice in my noodles...
"Ramen left on the streets" THAT ISNT WATER THATS BROTH then we got this cheetah girl who wants dry ramen bro its chunks like no-
ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE JUICE AND WATER BROTH IN IT WHY DO THEY LIKE IT DRY
That cheetah print girl really trying to be extra, she ain’t gotten used to broke ramen when she got caviar taste still
“Water” WHAT???? PLEASE
If you’re eating dry ramen, it’s not the meal for you.
This so American 😭Just call it ramen noddles
Ramen noddles with a little broth is What people call ramen
I like my ramen with lots of broth chives and hard boiled eggs . That looks so dry  what there eating .
100% accurate only poor college students pay for books rich kids have a free book pass
The girl in the black shirt had the best taste and the best honesty when rating. On the other hand, the tiger print lady is wack, "I dont like water".
Everyone except Cheyenne don't know how to eat instant ramen.
all of them but cheyenne actually know what they are doing RAMEN it’s supposed to have broth AHHHHHHHHHH
Ramen is supposed to be in a broth.  Leopard print girl isn’t even in the ball park.
Water? Girl that’s broth💀
Cheetah girl praying on they downfall😭

As a Nigerian I’m embarrassed cu. that’s not what Nigerian noodles should look like
Ramen is suppose to have broth and the noodles aren't suppose to be that gooey...out of three I wouldn't eat any of them
NOOO WE DIDNT GET TO SEE OLU’S REACTION!
Idk forgot the chick with African name her toan of voice she was fake all of it to win this challenge
As an asian, i will never forgive the cheetah girl
They didn’t even drink the broth man
bro this vid hurt 😭 "i don't like the water in it" it's broth first of all and i eat CUPS of ramen flooded with broth 😭
It’s not ramen but I like to use Konjak noodles (look it up), marinara sauce, and string cheese. I heat everything up in the microwave. It’s a good clean college meal to have for Sunday dinner when the dining hall is closed.
Ramen with no water is no ramen it’s spaghetti
Who eat ramen like that ? wtf!
the cheetah girl just aint it sorry.
Me just over here with non cooked ramen with the seasoning                      👁💧👄💧👁
so we all hate Olu?
oh hell nah… as an asian, this should be considered a hate crime😕😭😭
Do they not know what ramen actually is?
Who eats Ramen with a SPOOON!?!?!
"my moms Spanish"      hold up your mom cant be Spanish, Spanish is not a race its a langwidge
they was trying to find any reason to bash the last girl… “no color” and he needs shrimp in every bite? byeee😂
Ramen is supposed to have broth tf
They really called them broke in the title
“Smelling it  to make sure I’m not eating anything bad” her ramen 🏐🤮      Miss cheetah print saying her food ain’t flavorful when her ramen uncooked and dry asf
If curly head wasnt cute id be violating😂👎
These guys suck like I can make it 10x better
It’s soup. It’s ramen noodle *soup*  and a lot of people don’t understand that.
…….. why not just cook it… normally…. water,boil,noodles,powder. brother or not or with the cups , water to line , microwave 2 minutes or 2:30 , and eat.
Cheyenne did everything right! Do the other two not know your supposed to leave the water in your ramen?? 🤦🏽‍♀️
Ramen has broth yall 😳
why they all black tho???
why r u all calling her cheetah girl😭😭😭
WATERY ITS FUCKING BROTH. LITERALLY MOST PEOPLE EAT IT WITH WATER EVEN THE FUCKING CULTURE WHO CREATED IT DOES.
I'll give it a 2 they tried and at least it's edible
The only decent one in here is the one that ACTUALLY looks like a soup, idk y’all
Thts why you gotta stay humble 😂
‘sorry but I don’t like this ramen cuz it be  *SaLtY* 😫’
marco did this right but theres NO BROTH WOFOBWBIFOFWF
"What do you mean where did they go wrong?! They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it!"   IM ROLLIN 😭😭😭💀💀💀
In my country that’s a dry noodle not a ramen
The only one who knows how to make ramen is Cheyenne. Geeze people, Ramen is supposed to have watery broth in it. "Too watery". Every Asian chef has to be cringing at this right now.    Marcus' ramen was not too bad considering he did everything right except for one thing which is the reason Cheyenne said that the texture of the noodles was wrong was because there was no _stock broth_ for the noodles to absorb the broth. Without the stock broth, the noodles can't absorb anything which is why the texture was all wrong.   50% watery broth (Asian stock), 50% rest meat (of your choice) and veggies along with spices and a boiled egg (optional). _That is real ramen_ Despite my praise to Cheyenne, I do have to critique her for one thing; she didn't add spring onions or green onions or simple chopped vegetables and scrambled egg to her ramen dish.
"Broke" students wearing expensive $500 dollar make-up....seems legit.
Olu...just no
Cheetah girl said I put antagoongoon 😂
so does no one leave juice
its always the shady person-
i honestly dont like the cheetah print girls personality
Now tell me this channel i just came acrose why would u make this video of people sending hate to eachother about food🙃
Fried shrimp and ramen😩
water..doesn't cost anything...where is the broth?! I know for sure this isn't stir fry ramen
It’s BROTH
Why yal using spoons?
Both of them like what’s up with the water mean while that’s why theirs is so dry ..😂😣🤧
That’s how I eat my ramen with a lot of broth and some Valentina sauce it’s good af’ ☺️
Ramen is supposed to be a soup
The one that judges the food the most always lose
cheetah gal seems so full of it tbh
i want the cheetah girl to react to her score
out of all the videos i think i hate this one the most bc these people don’t know what ramen is💀 it’s suppose to have BROTH…. not WATER😭 the last girls soup was the only one that qualified as soup. others looked dry asf. the one dude calls it water but maruchan ramen, the one he said he used, packaging has the noodles in a bowl full of broth💀
why is the one girl worrying ab color… COLOR. y’all are suppose to be broke, i don’t think the color of the ramon matters. it’s tan noodles with brown broth…. what more do u want💀
2:40 JUST SHUSH DAYUMMM💀💀💀
I make my ramen. drink the broth.then throw it in a pan with sum scrambled 🍳 eggs.  Don’t knock it Till I try it

5:35 “it has water in it.. which is okay i guess.. i would prefer my ramen alittle bit more dry”  me: alittle is an understatement 😭😭😖
Wait...Do ppl fr not put broth in ramen. Like y'all be eating just the noodles.... 🤔 Mine usually had a lot of broth in it.
The thumbmail is racist
bruh those looked wack… all of them. mines better.
Notice how it’s only black students🤨
No this is not Nigerian vibe, no no no
i get beef or soy sauce ramen and some teriyaki chicken and while the noodles are cooking ill throw the chicken in and then drain the water and add tapatio and some butter and some beef gyoza or potstickers on the side thats my favorite ramen dish Feel free to try
bro the african girl think she all that chilllllll
Are they cooking on site or at home?? Because you cannot eat leftover noodles 💀 of course it’s gonna be a mushy clumpy mess!   I think some otherwise good food is getting bad marks because of reheating issues
I love these videos because the ones who talk the most shit be having the worst food 😭
Guy: Not enough shrimp. Me: aren't you guys supposed to be broke?
Why they be so mean and ugly
Y do I have the feeling that the " I like my Ramen more dry" girl  rated the Ramen of the others really worse so the chances of them winning gets lower  :( like Cheyenne Ramen deserves wayyy more and she noticed that her Ramen was better .. but she didn’t want to admit it 😏🙄
Yo dry ramen  do be fire when you hungry and ain't got chips
Let me just say this for a lot of people...we all kind of hated the cheetah print girl just because of the way she acted
THE RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH. Y R U EATING IT WITH A SPOON??? IM SO UPSET RN 😂😂😂
I really don't like the girl cheetah 🐆 print bc she is acting like her is the bomb
“i like mine more dry” yea we know.
*It looks dead* like yo dead hair
Yo they don’t learn? The one who talks the most and is over confident ALWAYS FAILS LMAOOOO
Where is the water? That’s the most dry ramen ever
ramen noodle was that hood meal if yo mom or dad didn't cook nothing
Those aint ramen...
Specifically broke Students.
It’s killing me how they gave them spoons likeeee it’s fricken noodles
Cheetah print pissing me off lowkey
"I preferred my ramen more dry"  Girl, is ramen. Not spaghetti.
Cheetah print needa stfu
I dont know why they have to be sooo meeannn sometimes
Bruh why are they complaining about the water in the Ramen it is suppose to have some type of broth in there not fricking desert dry
for those confused why one has broth or those who r angered that most don’t know ramen has broth it’s bc a lot of american peoples ramen doesn’t have soup except for the cup o noodles version, bc real ramen is japanese ramen with soup but koreans modernized it to be more instant  with spicier soup
Olu has behind your back mean girl written all over her🤣🤣
Marcus complains to much like shut up and eat it :|
The waters supposed to be there!!!! Put some weebs on here!!!!
sorry if this sounds rude I’m just saying how I fell,I am disappointed why is it dry there’s a thing call ramen 🍜 and you use seasoning boiling water and the noodles they all look dry to be honest what happen to the water and the one girl who had water it looked cold and dirty .😭☹️😤
That’s girl with the cheetah print is rude and bratty
4:12 THE NOODLE CHUNK ON THE TABLE HELP
“ look it’s a clump “😂😂😂
these people so extra😂 I just stick the Ramen in a pot with water and the flavoring and pow noodles with broth
THIS SHIII DRY ASL
Cheetah print girl: “all this suck mine the best” “its to salty” “season it mine better” The other two eat hers: “its dry crunchy its basically bread” she rlly thought she had the best one (Edit) lmao she got 2 points 😂
yall are being mean to olu 😭
I feel like olu would be the type of person that when you walk by her and her friends she would look at you dirty and laugh with her friends😭😭😭 I would get hella anxiety walking by her
you know why its 2 girls and 1 guy?? cuz dude a bihhhhh
Oodles n Noodles not Top Ramen
How is there only one person with a broth wtf broth is keyyyyy!! Bruh 😭😭 I love the dude and the last girl that graduated
I dont think they know what ramen is and judging by the comments some of you are lacking that knowledge as well. Ramen is not the same as noodles.
Ramen supposed to have broth, Olu has hers looking like a dessert, and Marcus has a yakisoba
"I don't like all the water.. it looks like ... it got flooded"  boy what 😭
Why the fuck does he keep saying "low key". It's such ignorant  slang and people sound ignorant talking like that. First of all "low key" means on the low, so that people don't know, but if you keep saying it over and over, it's not really "low key". It's so redundant.
I dont know why they were criticizing how much water she had in hers because sis, its soup but I do get how it might be a little too much water. And why she judging it off the colour like-
Y’all tell me ppl eat ramen with out the soup 🍜
im currently eating ramen :>
olu giving cassandra vibes LMAO
Did buzzfeed make a channel called cocoa butter?
Did she really just say remen  0:44
olu kinda a bitch lol
I like how they tried to diss Cheyenne's ramen when its literally a soup and the fact that they liked it and still dissed it
This video makes me frustrated
why do all they ramen look DRY AS FUCKK. pull out the tapatio and the lime
On the last bowl of Ramen have the two tasting it never heard of broth?😂 like I understand not likin it because I take my broth out but just callin it water threw me off 😂😂
Technically ramen is a soup but not everybody eat it like that so I don’t know why y’all mad
y’all it’s ramen it’s supposed to have broth what da hell
They putting in meat and shit, that ain’t broke!
Why broke?
Jesus was crucified , bore our sins in his body, he rose from the dead in 3 days, trust in him and gain eternal life. Without him we are lost
The noddles kinda looked good
Bruh what is that cheetah girl on 😂😂 like everything said said was weird and rude
The clumpy Noodles 🤣
me just boiling and putting the packet in
why are y’all feeding them ramen with a spoon 😩
Uhm the water is the best part especially when it’s super spicy and cheesy
Why they gotta be broke college kids 😭😭
Clearly none of them watch Naruto
Oluwamayowa😍🇳🇬 her naaame!!!
The Nigerian girl is like chicken is just an accessory how is chicken a accessory its food also if your broke how do you have accesories,
“The shrimps are whats saving the day”😏😏
This is so irritating! WTF broth is what makes it ramen, tf are these people draining their ramen for??? I'm pissed.
I thought majority of people keep the juice in their ramen??? If you go to an actual ramen place the juice is there….why they acting like noodles supposed to be dry asf LMAOOO
"This is pretty good, I like this...3" 😒
Um I didn't rly like any of the ramen 😀😃
"I don't like all the water"...? aren't they eating top ramen or smtg?? the one that's supposed to be soupy?? girl...... i- bye
“the ramen is a lil watery” UM NO SHIT SHERLOCK?
I love to have my Ramen with the water it's delicious 😋
Bro hit me up I'll give ya'll what I do with my ramen
Y'all all broke so u got no room to talk😂
I feel like cheetah print girl is one of those people who never read the instructions and thought they did it right
5:37 we know babe 😭😭
“the ramen is a bit watery”  bro what
The cheetah print girl is so mean wtf.
i work in an asian restaurant where we make high quality ramen and i am so surprised they call this thing *ramen*
How the fuck would you know how it tastes if you don’t put the food in your mouth!!! I hate when these people act like children. It’s food. Eat it, it can’t look THAT bad…
ITS NOT WATER ITS SOUP AND RALMEN CAN HAVE THEM!
im getting triggered cuase they are pronounced ralmen wrong
Olu doesn't know how to eat bomb😂
Havent watched it in its entirety yet.    god help them if they got Panda Signature ramen
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH!!!
these people so shady wtf? im glad the kind girl won.
There is no struggle with crayfish lol where it's at??  ?
Those all looked so bad
Yall dont leave a little water in the noodles??…😃
Bru ramen is a soup😭
Bro... who are these people? "ITs tOo WEt" *Spongebob Chicken Lips meme*
Spices dont change the fact that your food is shit. It's like replacing deodorant with perfume! Shit still stank
This title is so relatable, I had to watch it
I make ramens better then yalll
Nobody else bothered by them eating Ramen with a spoon?…just me? oh okay🙄
The soup is what makes the ramen good... if i was there i think i would have won . I be puttin hotsauce vinegar pepper pinch of garlic salt and some creole seasoning .. its bomb (may not sound good but its delish"
Ramen is supposed to have liquid in it
As a Nigerian we do not claim olu
Ok to clear up some things, ramen is a soup dish. When you have no soup = noodle dish or stir=fry noodle dish. Don't say "buuttt samyang" First that is korean noodles and it's called ramyun. Its typically with a soup like shin ramyun or no soup like with samyang! Indomie is indonesian noodles so typically no soup.
As an Asian, THEM EATING RAMEN WITH SPOON IS THE MOST IRRITATING THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFEEE
I’ve noticed that it’s always the one talking the most shit that had the worst food. 😂And Ontop of that the guy talks SO much omg. Just shut up and taste it already.
3:54  *FINGERRRRRS*
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.   Here’s a reminder of how much God loves you! God bless you🤍
I'd say Cheyenne's ramen was something that I'd make  i really like all the flavour in the broth so I would have more of it
Who eats ramen dry? Wha-
Ramen is always supposed to have juice tf
Where is the broth I don’t think this is Ramen noodles there’s no broth
What other spices do you put in Roman except packets
I can make better Ramen than these guys bro I’m only 12
I don't care what brand they used or what they added, the only thing that matters is the crime they all committed of leaving out the *broth* .
my main concern is why they are eating it with a spoon if there was no soup
Bruh, that olawamhuansmssjisna or cheetah girl actin like she the Gordon Ramsey of ramen💀
"I put some shimp in there" Literally 1 shrimp
these were all terrible 💀💀
Are the ones with the first two not aware that ramen is a SOUP and should contain water to begin with? Wtf?
This dumb b said it's salty and then said the noodles had no flavor how does that work
Your legit supposed to have soup wtf
Y’all use a spoon?
Okay so we Asians don't exist... I -
dude, i love my ramen with broth?? isn’t it supposed to have broth-
The one so confident has the lowest score 😂
Y’all eat y’all ramen dry? Ewww it’s supposed to have a little water
Yo is this even real! or is it for views.. either way it’s entertaining! lol truthfully all that shit looked nasty though I would have thrown some green onions, beef packed ramen  and some beef... but they suppose to be starving student so there you go !
I think these ppl should stay far away form ramen cuz none of them knew how to cook it😭😂  You can add shrimp to ramen but not oyster sauce🤢. The cheetah girl shouldve just not cooked the ramen and jusy crack it and add the flavor to it as in South Korea it is considered a snack that is actually good. But you dont cook it you just crack the ramsn in pieces and add flavors. For the boy he shouldve cooked his ramen for 3 to 5mn as it is ok. I would recommend to add flavors as well because the chicken will not give taste to the ramen but only to the chicken itself
Watery lol as if ramen isnt sapose to be swiming in broth
5:38 "I prefer my Ramen a little more dryy.." oh girl- we can tell LMAOOO
Wait since when is broth foreign, like I'm legitimately confused
Aunty alatagungun , olowo sibi
Ok forget everything about this entire video BUT  Are they using to spoons to eat it!??!?!?! The noodles are just gonna fall of the spoon its why you use a fork
BROTH....BROTH....BRROOOOTTHHHH!!!!! smh
why are they dry..?
people really eat their ramen dry..?
The first issue is they eating with spoons 😐
"The ramen's a lil bit watery" ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOUP IN IT😭 Yall need to call your stuff just noodles instead
This episode got me SCREAMINNNN "IS THAT A HAIR" 🤣🤣🤣
Why are ppl trying to be creative when you could just buy indomie in bulk
Who tf eats ramen without broth 😂😂🤔
I love how the title says “broke college kids”
Idk if these guys know what even ramen is
most ramen have the broth, wtf are they talking about lol?
don't matter what you add to the ramen, its not a good ramen if the noodles aren't cooked right.
My mom is nigerian and I hate crayfish 🤮
The cheetah  girl was like giving me second hand  embarrassment    And was like so annoying when they were trying the dudes  ramen
“water….” It’s BROTH 😭 can I be friends with cheyenne. She did everything right.
Broke college students….all blacks kids tf
"it actually tastes pretty good, just missing color" "3"
Ramen is suppose to have liquid 😂😂 it’s a soup. I can’t believe the girl with the pretty fro talked all that mess and had the worst ramen 😂 why was it clumpy??
Me as an Asian I cringe 😬
These Africans girls try to belittle us sometimes by their shady comments “oh you haven’t tried this before” girl shut up I date your men all the time and they cook for me too ha! 🤣
Starting to see a trend here….
Marcus ramen is how I eat my ramen 🔥
cheetah girl is a pick me😂
Eating with a spoon-
You don't have to be Asian to know that ain't ramen lool that is shambles god knows what you lot be eating in America.
Rumen with a spoon? Wtf
The whole point of this video: people trying other people's ramen  Me: Stressed out because they're using spoons and not forks.   (Maybe it's weird but it makes SENSE)
It’s all the ones who talk down on every body food that have the nastiest food🤣🤣
I think I'd win this shit , the homies really tell me to cook them they noodles cause mines be tasting better , ayo put me on here dude
Cheetah girl: the ramen is a bit watery and it has no color it’s just grey Me: no shit Sherlock the ramen is suppose to have water/soup and you might be color blind- Ramen: why are still here? Just to suffer?
The Nigerian girl was just being a hater for no reason
who else here from shake sauce
Y’all raging bout cheetah print girl- IM TAKIN BOUT WHY THEY HAVE SPOONS INSTEAD OF FORKS!
the cheetah girl be givin second hand embarrassment, the fact she said hers was bomb. It didn’t even take the other two contestants to do a taste tests, just a damn look and it already a 0/10💀
Isn't Ramen supposed to be soupy?
Why are they eating it w/ a spoon?!
a bowl of breadcrumbs😭
why are they broke.
Bruh you need to put frozen veggies and frozen crab in that shi
"I dont like all the water", I mean damn, thats how you make ramen! Last chick was the only one who actually made a proper ramen. She wins by default!
THEY ALL SAID THEY "DON'T LIKE WATER IN IT" I CAN'T
Okay the beautiful black woman with the braids is the only one who made is right.
The cheetah print girl: I prefer my ramen more dry    I was weakkk asf   Me:  i can see that lmaooo 😭 and hard too
Damnn cheetah print girl broke but still be complaining-
hearing them complain about the soup is making my soul hurt so much. honestly, cheyenne's ramen was the only acceptable one
The cheetah girl gives me ' where is the flavour, I cant taste anything...'  vibes
🤣🤣🤣 ok dry ramen with a spoon 🥄 to broke for fork or chopsticks, grab 2 pencil it’s easier
Easy ramen recipe:  Whatever flavored ramen you want  (I prefer chicken ramen with chili ramen mixed)   Heat pot until near boiling   Put in for 3:30 or 4:00 minutes    Take out the ramen with a fork   Pour as much water as you want into your bowl   Put in the included seasonings  Mix  It’s really not that hard  ALSO THEY’RE EATING IT WITH A SPOON
Yo who eats their ramen without broth??? That’s hella weird 😂😂😂
Do you have to be black to be on this channel? Because I don’t find that very inclusive. Just my opinion tho.
Ramen is supposed to have broth I was committing die I heard them call the broth “water”
FYI Salt isn’t really a seasoning. It helps bring out the flavor of other seasonings
Why is their Ramen so dry???
WHO 👏 TF 👏 EATS 👏 DRY 👏 RAMEN?! 🤣
The minute she said her mom is Spanish I knew she was going to win!
What's the cheetah print girl @ cuz I gotta tell her her Raman was GARBAGE cooking is definitely not for her she can't even cook the noodles all the way I feel sorry for her bf☠☠
You gotta have the water like broth
the cheetah girl embarrassed tf outta herself lmao
This whole video is beyond embarrassing. Like honestly wtf were they even thinking with their answers- Like legitimately the cheetah girl and the guy don't know shit about ramen. No broth?? ew
Cook the ramen regularly
Glad I’m not the only person with texture problems lol
as a nigerian, we don't claim her ramen
I’m concerned. Did they not read the instructions on the ramen package? It says clearly that ramen has broth. My asian blood boils so bad right now.
I’m really confused. Where did they find these ppl? Who taught them to make noodles?
Ew these look horrible 🤢 tf
i’m two minutes in and i alr don’t like that cheetah girl :/
bruh why is everyone so savage ☠️☠️ relax babes you're not gordon ramsay
The shit literally says, "Soup" on the damn package.
soooo, who on the staff gave them spoons?
bring back the frat bros, this negative energy is not it for me
bruh olu is such a pick me girl
All them was nasty they need me up their!!
_i use spices that are not well known, therefore i am superior._
They're eating Ramen with no broth and a SPOON, they all should lose edit: nvm girl in black knew what she's doing with the shrimp and oyster sauce😭💕 should've had more broth tho its RAMEN
I like how the most cocky bias one be shitting on the others food but once they try theirs they all say it's horrible and be the worst one out of all of them😭😂
Cheetah girl: calls guy’s ramen dry  Also Cheetah girl: I prefer my ramen a little more dry.
You guy’s don’t add the broth?
The 3rd one they just say bad things but they know they love it
First of all. They had to BRING the ramen there 😭😭😭
“My ramen is coming in with a different vibe”   The vibe: 🏜🌵☀️🏝

It ain’t water it is called soup or whatever that is suppose to be in ramen  😑
I love how yahll put the person on the side of who they are trying fun cause I allways get confused thank god🤲
Ugh I wanna make my ramen for them 🤣🤣🤣
3:47 could 10000000000000000% be a meme
I really don't like the Cheetah girl, she  just said "I am not trying to be mean, but it's killing me" when she first tasted the boy's noodles, just give her some maggi 😉
That Dusty Cheetah Girl can't even cook ramen but has the audacity to talk about people
“I like my ramen a lil more dry” girl we can tell 😭 but seriously how are y’all eating ramen without the broth that’s the best part......
FYI...Real ramen is in broth lol. Why do they want their ramen so dry lol. Also FYI there are instant noodles that are meant to be dry that come with a sauce.
ur name is what? 🧍
The cheetah girl is that grandme  from that sweet potato vid
first of all it's supposed to have water that's where the flavor comes from second of all why are they eating it with a spoon!?! these people don't know anything about ramen and it shows 😭 it's painful
I got the besst ramen noodles
The cheetah print girl be pissing me off😂😭
Do they not know what ramen is?
Do these mf’s not put broth in their ramen-
Not no chunky ramen😳
Where is the Broth?

Why are you eating ramen with a FUCKING SPOON
Olu so confident then got a 2🤣  Lesson of the day: don’t have an ego, don’t be narcissist..lol

Girl we not going to say how she hyped up her ramen but when they see it, they like pass on it- [spoliers: she got 2 as a rating. one picked 0 and the other one picked 2]
Girl we get it, you like to put "atatagoon" on everything.
Who else keeps a little bit of water in their ramen💯
They all look the same 🤣
Lol she bigged her Raman up so much and they TORE it apart lol 😂
I LITERALLY CANNOT WITH THE CHEETAH PRINT GIRL LMFAOO, BOTH HERS AND THE GLASSES GUY WERE HELLA DRY BRO
the delusion in this video makes me feel so seen
As an asian person, I feel personally attacked seeing none of them decided to keep the broth
these ramens were straight up just bad like what are they thinking?
I feel like the girl in cheetah print was extra and just doing to much
As an Asian only Cheyenne got it the correct one. It must be with a soup. Periodt
For me the broth ENHANCES the ramen 🍜🍜🍜
You can try this if you want but please repent of your sins anyone because Jesus christ died on the cross for you and he payed the wages of sin so all you have to do is srecive it you can do this by saying     Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner. I believe You died for my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life. I confess You as my personal Lord and Savior. Please do this so you dont have to burn in hell for eternity and if you do this and TRULY belive and have faith you will be saved and whoever belives in him shall not perish but have eternal life with God! John 3:16 says but remember just because God is not responding to your praying does not mean he is not there because God is there all you have to do is seek him and pray because he Adores you and cares about you because he is the one and only God,savior and creater!! SO accept him TODAY NOT LATER
“my moms Spanish” yes she’s a language 😜 🤨🤨🤨 make it make sense please 💀
Isn't ramen supposed to have broth?😀
WHY are they eating with spoons ? Lmaoooo that’s crazy
Why did that girl in the cheetah say “ Ramen “ like that lmao
Ok but how long has their ramen been sitting there before they tried it
Olu need to stfu w her hating self 🤦🏻‍♀️
Isn’t ramen supposed to be in broth? 😂
Why the other two act like there isn’t water / soup in ramen or have they not eaten it like that…..
its the clump of noodle next to Cheyenne bowl at 4:11 FOR ME lolololol
cheetah print girl be saying “it has no color” like as if her ramen didn’t have color either and it looked hella dry!
"it's salty, like are they trying to kill me" isn't ramen supposed to be salty or did i miss something
To me they all looked trash like where is the broth when your broke you wanna get the most out of your meal and the broth adds a lot like what is this 😭
I know she ain’t talking when she doesn’t have water in it🤨 that’s why it was a clump
Broke college kids 💀
bit of remen
Ramen: **a Japanese soup** Marcus and olu: why does the soup have water?
0:37 he looks gray........
They haven't had any real ramen 🤣
Why don’t y’all have a fork?!!!! Why are you eating ramen with a fuckin spoon?!!!!!!!!!
this feels like cultural appropriation but also not really
that cheetah print girl was so annoying
He said they went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it.   Naija in the mud. 😭
My asian blood is EVAPORATING. We are way past boiling point.

Dis ain’t broke dese folks playin wit dey food🥲
The title tho 😃
my sister free yourself from the shackles of crayfish, lol you try sha
The other two ramen look dry as hell 😕
Why its so dry 😂
Wait why would u drain the broth it literally holds most of the flavor 💀
Ok what mf gave them just a spoon… can’t watch this
i just put a lot of lime and valentina
The girl in the animal print reminds me of “jade” from the Cosby’s. The theatre chick Theo kissed behind kristines back
these are not true collage struggle meats, true ones have bar minimal good ingredients even shitty cheap shrimp would be a bit pricy just to add to some instant ramen
*first girl name was like onomatopeawakanda ... lmfao 🤣🤣🤣*
The girl olu said the first one was salty but yetttttt it has no taste??🤔🤔🤔
"I like my ramen more dry"   no kidding
Ramen is one of those things that I think everyone, literally every single person, likes it differently. The way I make ramen I absolutely love -- but I've never made ramen for someone else and had them enjoy it. And vice versa. I like my noodles pretty firm, so I usually only let the noodles boil for about two minutes, then rest on the counter in the bowl for a minute more. I usually mix in the seasoning packet to the water while the noodles are cooking, and then use just a bit of that broth in the noodles. Sometimes I'll add stuff like mushrooms and green onions. Also, my favorite -- a slice of good old American cheese melted in it. It makes it so oily and creamy and rich. Sometimes I might add a dash of something spicy if I'm using a beef or soy sauce flavor, but if I'm using chicken flavor? A splash of lemon juice and some black pepper.
We're do rude to each other
If they tried my spread I would’ve won
Ok that girl who said “ArE U tRyInG tO KiLL mE” I hate her vibes
Just wondering why does the ramen need colour ?!?!😭😭
The guy is lowkey funny
ramen is a soup its not a dry food
I'm sorry I'm laughing my head off about Olu
What's wrong with the boy and the cheetah print girl ??😑
They have the audacity to call it “ramen” but don’t want “water” in it, honey then it’s pasta or noodle not ramen anymore
...with a spoon...
Who eats ramen with a spoon how are supposed to pick it up
How you broke and got Nigerian spices and crayfish?
Nah Yall needa eat maruchan in the cup, with the water add Valentina and limon then that’s good
Me going to college this fall but i ain’t going to be eating that my mom and my sister lives 5 minutes away
Wait am I the only person who leaves broth in with my noodles?
Mayowa why u gotta embarrass Nigeria like dat!!! Like what did you make 🤔 I was really rooting for you girl but those noodles wasn't it 😓
Olu didn't have running water in her appt
If you were going to talk smak you had to back it up and it chunky
This channel is racist
I’m confused how on the first one she said it was salty then she said I didn’t have flavor like hmmmmm💀
Lmao these people clearly have never had actual ramen. The actual dish has broth. Learn before you give all of your annoying opinions. And I am happy Olu got a 2. I understand people putting their spin on broke college food but Sis literally tried to make rice using cheap ramen noodles 🤢🤮
Why is shordy in the fro so serious 😂
Dey Boujee never cooked wen dey where home smh... Put me on dis bihh everyone be licking their fingers
Mayowa has disgraced us😭
Dude, olu and that guy talk mad shit about everyone's ramen, and theirs is so dry and gross. Like, "oh, gross, this one is so wet" like, hey stupid, ramen is SUPPOSED to have broth! It's called ramen noodle SOUP! Couple of ignorant bullies.
6:06 this grl is talking how good her ramen was when her score was 2.
#collegegirl #travisporter
it’s literally ramen and theyre talking like critics “it has no color” GIRL
Okkkkkk UB!!
lmao Nigerians always SWEAR their food so good and it’s slop
2:05  she says “its gross  its too salty!”...2:17  and then says “people!!  Season the Ramen!  What!? Girl make up your mind
SHOUTOUT TO THE SHRIMP WHO SAVED THE DAY
“U gotta have shrimp throughout the whole thing”...ur broke college kids..that bag of shrimp has to last all week!
Why are they using spoons to eat ramen
olu: *i would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry* babe a little bit would be an understatement.
Why are they rat noodles with spoon
Who eats ramen dry tf?
Stupid kids, RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH!!!!!!!!! Litterally the main component of ramen, yes even instant ramen is the damn broth. When i was a broke ass student I made ramen with veggies and meat when available.  Watch literally any Japanese instant ramen tutorials and they make broth. Ramen is named for their broth base. Soy(shoyu), pork(tonkotsu), chicken, bean(miso).
Its literally ramen come on
Love how they put broke in the title 😍
“My first thing is to smell it to make sure I’m not eating anything bad ya know?” ITS LITERALLY RAMEN🤠
2:40 gives me Karen vibes
At the end of the day it’s instant ramen
Smh the broth is the most important part
It was the noodles lookin stiff for me
I’m sorry but the first ramen look hard and dry
girl bye ramen is supposed to have soup
WHY ARE THEY USING SPOONS
im pretty sure these people don't know what ramen is ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER
Hey Olu, the thing was to rate it not compare-
Mfs eat everything with fork and knife but they are eating ramen with a spoon wtf
bruh it's supposed to have broth.. the girl with the shrimp definitely had the best
Half the ramen is the broth yall dumb ash😭
What these people dont understand is that just because you like YOUR OWN FOOD doesn't mean that the others will also enjoy everything you like, them saying things like "Im not even tryna be mean but this is terrible" they dont take in consideration that people enjoy other things
What the hell noodles yall making nigga
How in the world can she hype her shit up that much, and have them find it horrible
Beef ramen, microwave for 4 minutes, add tony chacheres, and Lawrys, little bit of butter. That’s my ramen 🤤🤤🤤 I prefer my noodles to be a LITTLE bit hard. Not completely soft. So no more than 4 minutes for mine. So good.
The one who won ... won because she made it correctly lol it’s supposed to have broth in it lol
0:44 bro🤣🤣😭
can we have a fair video for once?. there's always gonna be that one person criticizing
I feel bad for Marcus
Chop sticks
Eat Raman with spoon what?????
Why the spoon
00:09   I thought she was about to say:  *"OMAE WA MOA SHINDERU"*
Bruh I could've got some cup noodles, one of those laughing cow cream cheese things, and come out as the victor. That's real broke 🍜
“It’s salty” miss girl they were broke . What do you expect a Gordon Ramsay meal?😭tf
Alright yeah they cant make some damn noodles correctly BUT WHAT ABOUT THERE MAJORS MY GAWD THEY ARE SMART ASF
Notice how it say broke collage student and they all black
2:45 Says the ramen is “Too dry” 5:37 Also her:
"There's a little bit of water in it, I prefer mine dry" Girl we know, you with your clumpy dry Ramen
cheetah girl is competing with popeyes biscuits with the driest food know to mankind
The last girls ramen actually looked good
OK  I don’t wanna be rude or nothing but the girl with the cheetah print acting like Gordon Ramsey but her food is :🪨🪨🪨
would definitely like marcus's with like hot sauce from Goya mmmmh
yall never had soup broth?
Instant ramen technically isnt home made but i get what they meant
Yo Olu is trippin... Ramen isn't about the noodle as much as it's about the broth and condiments!
AHHHH so funny how different they are it’s because she’s Nigerian 😂 we have so many flavors that everything else doesn’t have a taste
I don’t understand why ramen is supposed to be dry in their minds??? It’s a type of soup. Not regular pasta noodles. It should have broth.
Where is the broth???
Less than a year into our friendship, I got a little too heated with my best friend because they tried to argue that ramen isn't supposed to have liquid in it--the packaging literally says "Ramen Noodle Soup" where are y'all getting this no-liquid idea from? I've definitely calmed down a lot because I realized it actually tastes good with no broth sometimes but I still am quick to point out "soup" lmao.
They talked all that shit about number three but they liked the taste. They can’t even front.
Bruh Ramen has to have water
Water? Omfg goodbye 😭🖐🏽
I'm sorry but yall eat... DRY RAMEN wtf is that a thing😭
I’m confused, you’re supposed to have soup in it!
3:17 “Looook, it’s a cluuump.”  😆
Ramen is supposed to have soup 🍜
Prison people would dominate in this challenge
this bitch goes from "this is too salty" to "season your ramen"
College Educated Young People and they just open up the packet of Ramen then act as if they can't read the back of the packet! OMG The Winner only won by a hair's breath because there was actually liquid in the bowl and there was Shrimp!  Sorry Guys but maybe you all should have stuck to the poor college students other option; Spaghetti.
Bro wtf is this shit
whys the camera so grey looking
All them ramens was not it 💀
They gave them a spoon🤦🏾‍♂️😂
The minute they took a bite on the last one, I knew it was good.
What I found funny was that their eating ramen with a spoon 🤣😂
No cap my ramen would be the best 🥴 not once has someone told me I don’t make bomb ramen at 3am 😭 🤚 1 like = one of my recipes for you to try
The fact that they using spoons instead of forks says alot
Olu: I know I fucked up so I’m about to hate on everything......
they wanted to hate the last girls so badddd and the cheetah girl was big CAP
It was sad(kinda funny) when she said that she was gonna win but right after the guy said its dry as (bleep)
None of that was Ramen. Ramen has broth. That looked like flavorless spaghetti.
I feel bad for the ramen that looked like mashed potatoes
I didn't know people made a prominent soup without having an actual soup as the final product.
i just want to know why those other 2 are eating dry ramen😬
As a proud Nigerian Prince... On God, she the type to tell her Ma in law; "I cooked the tea he had for breakfast." I swear I ain't eating non of y'all food now! Can't be trusted. Can't take the chance.
Mom: What Should We name her?  Dad: How about Oluwamayowa?
I love Ramen. The first one I ate was Nissan cup o soup.chicken flavor.  Interesting how you added to it. When I was younger I never thought to do that. Enjoy and have fun.
As a fellow Nigerian we do NOT claim her.
Oh no not the already eaten cracker ewe
“I don’t like all the water” bruhhh *bruhh* you don’t have broth?? How do you cook it?  And then the “it doesn’t look like it has anything on it, the pasta is bare” Because. Of. The. Broth. The flavour is in the broth? That covers the noodles
Why they gotta be broke
Is there not supposed to be water in ramen bro wtf😂
these all look gross and bland as hell, girl I wouldn't touch any of these with a ten foot pole, at least get some gochujang in there, those noodles make Morticia Adams look tan, damn
I get the chicken maruchan, I heat it up in the microwave for 4 minutes, add 4 ice cubes, a lot of Valentina and some lemon
Yikes I needed to be on this episode.
"I'll give it a three, next" bro you didn't get a three
Bro they all look like my grandads foot bottom😭
“i'd preferred my ramen a little bit more dry ” yeah we know 😭
This naija girl just go fall pesin hands o🤦🏾‍♀️
Why does he look like Sid the Science Kid
everyone in this video was annoying fr
i just wanna know why they eating it with a spoon
She said Remen why are the minority’s always got the worst food they just talk to much but yo food looks like ass
Just have to put ATATAGUN
I AM SO GLAD THAT OLU GIRL LOST!! Her critiques were so ass backwards, and the CLUMPS??!!! The other two looked and sounded good.
The fact she said it’s salty ramen has so much salt in it lol
I had more money in college than I have now.
Do black people really think noodles are made with air and no water cause I'm lost
But they have no water in there ramen you know noodles as a soup so water
Oh my goodness, these women are absolutely BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍😍
The cheetah girl was the only person that made ramen, it’s supposed have broth!
Your supposed to leave the water in....
It's not ramen are u joking it's look anything but not ramen hhhh
outs their whole shit in the first three words of the title.
They... They don't like broth???
who doesnt have broth in their ramen yall are wack
They Making seen like Ramen suppose to have a special recipe 😂
Ok but like, people are out here eating dry ramen??
“Its watery” sweetie thats called broth
Couldn’t have picked people who know what broth is? Or have an open mind? Initial thought you don’t like it? When you don’t even know what broth is! Ahhhh
But it...it says soup...on the package 😖
Broth, it’s called broth
Am I the only one that eat that like a soup 😐 us Mexican lol
Learned a protip from my dad... sautee a little onion, season up some ground beef with the onion (using a little less onion powder than usual).... cook up the Ramen about half way then drain it almost dry... throw them in with the beef... add a lil milk and grated sharp cheddar... salt and pepper to taste... garnish🤤🥴
they are so mean and for what.. lol
Crazy how all the quote on quote “broke” people are black
Olu had the worst ramen and she needed to be humbled ong 🤣
Nigerian styled?? AS A NIGERIAN WE DONT CLAIM HER FOOD OH 😭☝🏾
That girl in the Afro was hyper he shit up so much and her ramen BOMBED 💀💀💀💀
“My mom is Spanish” ???
cheetah rating them like hers aint dry like a grandmas cooter
From the time Olu opened her mouth… we already knew! 😆 Say less!
“Broke college students” 😂
Most of these arent even ramen. They made fuckin dry pasta dishes w ramen noodles.
They getting ramen, and chow mein mixed up. Ramen has broth. Chow mein is a dry stir-fried noodle dish.
Marcus looks like Sid the Science kid.
Cheetah print girl probably eats her atagongoon straight out of the bottle.
The real question is why they eating ramen with a spoon
That girl with the Afro tryna get a good score
Ah ah Olu.... how you go talk de talk but your ramen no walk de walk...
im asian and their ramen... oh hell no 😭😭😭😭😭
No front but that is so far away from ramen that you can't even call it ramen no more 😅
There obviously crazy cause ramen is soup it’s supposed to be soupy not dry
she said its salty but its bland like wtf
Some bomb ass ramen for me is cooked until the noodles are really soft and the color of the broth, I season with tajín, cayenne, and the packet it comes with, as far as meat canned chicken cooked in teriyaki sauce with black pepper slaps.
This is kinda racist
MARUCHEN? BOA TF U MEAN
Bro why they actin like Ramen isn't a soup dish like it's supposed to have broth in it.
"I prefer my ramen more dry" then just eat pasta without the sauce then ig. Also, from my standpoint, only cheyenne resembled ramen lol
That one girl was talking a lot for ramen that's was barely edible apparently
It's always the ones that loose that got a lot to say.
She really said.. I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry.. 😐 girl you literally took yours out the bag and probably threw some warm water on it and called it a day
It’s always the one who got so much to say that food be the nastiest 🤣
They all looked bad tf
why is there no soup??!!!!!
Cheetah girl needs to be quiet, her’s had CLUMPS
Yall put too much water in the Ramen lol
How do not know how to make Raman like tf
Notice how all of them are black…
I LOVE HOW EVERYONE IS DRAGGING CHEETAH PRINT GIRL PLEASE-
It’s a soupppppp
Looks like no one told them that ramen is a soup
so help me out here do black people not like the soup of the RAMEN the 3rd girl for sure won
this is honestly such a disgrace and that cheetah girl acting like she knew everything when she clearly doesnt know a thing what ramen actually is. anyways at least props to the girl who knew that ramen is supposed to be served with broth and not uncooked, it actually resembled ramen the most, and she seemed really sweet. anyways ramen tastes wayyy better with real vegetables and siracha
yo im buggin , who likes ramen dry asf ? 😭like i need that broth .
The one shrimp help
This was funny i enjoyed😂
notice how the people with the biggest egos always have the worst rating😭
I’m sorry but how hard is it to make ramen? 😭 like baby just cook the noodles drain it leave a little bit of water and add some seasoning 😭 or Sriracha and done
ngl my ramen recipe is just crush up the noodles while they’re in the bag, put them in a bowl, pour water on top, microwave 3min, stir, microwave 2 more min, add flavor packet and stir
Olu's ramen has to be eaten with a pitch fork cause that was some straight dry tumbleweed looking stuff. 🤣😂🤣🏜🐫🌵
Cheetah girl needs some lessons and a whole pie of humbleness, drier than a damn biscuit TF
I used to make some gourmet ramen when I was deployed, especially when I was on the MEU, I used to snag a bunch of the basic little condiment packets and throw in some scraps of what I could find when my ass was starving on watch!  Needless to say, everybody wanted me to make em a bowl!
3:08 cap
It's salty are you trying to kill me lol
Them eating RAMEN with a spoon is stressing me out. Why is all their ramen so damn dryyyyyy my God!?
Yall eating Ramen dry?????
anyone else search up "ramen" cause they are eating ramen and found this?  just me?   *ok..*
None of this is anywhere close to being "broke". Smh. The difference in being BROKE and college broke.
“A tsunami hit and like this was the ramen like left in the STREETS-“😂😂
“A clump” lolololol😂😂😂 She was talking so much I thought it was going to be the best one 😭
Olu acting like she made the best Ramen even though we all know it was garbage
Yo they never had actual Ramen. It's a whole soup like if i was from Japan I would be mad as hell.
Ramen is literally a SOUP but they're talking about "I don't like it cuz it has water". Have you never had any authentic ramen????
The nigerian girl couldn't even cook proper ramen
They know nothing about ramen. Like bro it’s suppose to have the broth in it
Omg Idk why it’s making me so mad they’re complaining about the broth like literally what ramen is 😭 when you get ramen at a place that’s how it’s served
broooo the ramen is NOT supposed to be that dry. and why all the seasonings??? just the packet, salt, and pepper. (personally i add hot sauce)
Me sitting here eating my brothy ramen. 🤣
How you mess up a pack of noodles 😂
Stop buying fancy spices and shrimp for Ramen Noodles if you're broke.
I think a lot of Polynesian people can make ramen a lot better than most people!! Just an opinion...
5:39 yeah… we know👀👀👀
6:17 girl it’s supposed to have broth lmao it’s ramen 😭✋
y tf there using spoons
Ramen noodles supposed to have atleast some water in it who eating drr- 👀 Nevermind 🚶🏽
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon😭

Do these ppl not know what Ramen is THERES BROTH
Let's face it.....they liked Cheyenne's and dass it
NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE RAMEN BRUHHH it’s supposed to be a soup based dish y’all pls
The cheetah girl is giving me pick me girl vibes 😭🔫
We needed a larger panel. This was kind of a bummer! Everyone hated everyone else's struggle meal
These gotta be the funniest comments ever 😂
The disrespect they eating with a spoon
The  fascinated cold pathologically comb because europe appropriately taste sans a cool lute. last, protective woman
It's always the one talking the most smack that loses the worst 🤣
wait what? no no nooo ramen has soup on ittttt that water is the souppp the broth haiya i can hear my ancestors crying
they picked the most annoying people for this video
the cheetah girl is so?!?!?!??!
The few fierce apartment subjectively hum because ravioli nationally love unto a political textbook. simplistic, endurable opinion
Fuck wrong with yall
“They went wrong by waking up” mans got asked a question and answered with violence.
"This sh** is dry as hell"  my man the whole point is to be broke
Ramen should have water lmao 😂😂😂
I like juice in my ramen
She didn't like the broth in the last girl's? She prefers her ramen a bit more dry? You don't say.....
Tf you mean the noodles are too wet
Idk how they made ramen so damn DRY. Like it’s so fking easy to make why they struggling to make PROPER ramen 😭
The only one that looks like ramen is Cheyenne's. 🤷‍♀️
cheetah girl annyoying asf
Marcus I already know damn right he cheating af. He’s saying he doesn’t like it so he can win- like it’s just the biggest vibe for that
Cheyenne's looked best, but why all them dry? Yes I've made drained ramen before but I like soup more. And for broke college students: Ramen at Dollar General 1 dollar for 6  in a package, buy some dam frozen mixed veggies and get some chicken or pork( where you spend the most) throw that dang packet out of ramen package in bowl for later(stock) or in trash, contains way too much salt. Cook your meat in a pan browning it slightly, take the water and any spices you like and veg and add to meat turning down to simmer , cook noodles in microwave with water and drain when done. put cooked/drainednoodles in bowl and pour over hot saucepan withe all that goodness in to bowl over noodles and add hot sauce(Texas Pete or the like to top)
Who else came here from shakesauce?
i like the liquid, i like my noodles soft,add a lil salt, sugar n butter
Ms Nigeria gives me a headache
6:37 *Precedes to eat the shrimp and not the actual Ramen*
Where is the fucking soup!?!?!
The whole point of Raman is that it's a soup!! Why are they dry 😕
they calling it WATER 😂😂✌
4:10 the clump just sitting on the table like it's not food 💀💀
“It’s too salty, what are you trying to do, kill me?”  Same bowl, different take.  “The only thing seasoned is the chicken. Season the ramen. There’s no flavor, mine actually had taste.”
All I put is hot sauce.  Tapatio/valentina
Dry ramen is good if you make it right. This bitch cooked it for 30 seconds
Does being broke come with no water too cuz most of their ramen are as dry as a fucking desert 😭🤚 I love uncook ramen, but that shit way to dry. Especially the second person’s ramen, that shit more dry than my lips during the winter.
Bro Afro girl is weird to Marcus
Why are all of the BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS Black
As a Nigerian man this is not a Nigerian ramen
WATER?! This is a crime
the last ramen was defiantly the best one. or at least it looked like it
Cheetah print girl was so cocky yet hers was the worst 😭😭
if i ever say the ramen is watery my asian family will lock me in the bathroom with no lights on as punishment 🥲
*them eating with a spoon* *dry as hell ramen, like, ya'll ever heard of soup* *"i'd prefer mine a bit dry", no shit??* the last girl, a round of applause for her please. seems like she the only one who's seen  a pic of ramen.
I love the broth in the ramen
Does nobody like sauce in their ramen??
Raw men
Never bring 🐆 girl back
The 2nd girl be mean and saying "mine actually has flavor and mine is actually good" and her noodles actually is the worst🤣
Where is the water
Well duh if asian students were in the vid they would get bodied. They literally invented them  you dodo heads.
“i would prefer my ramen a little more dry” oh we can tell, we can tell
ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A SOUP???? RAMEN IS A SOOOUP that's why it's ramen NOODLES ramen is the soUP. THE NOODLES ARE THE NOODLES in the SOUP
The cheetah girl just straight up irritates me.
Olu baby, you so misrepresented the Nigerian culture. What was that supposed to be 😂
okay, this is just my opinion. so for the first part, where they ALL went wrong was using a spoon. like who eats ramen with a spoon, even if there’s sauce. and yeah i said sauce not water cause it’s not water. secondly, the 1st & 2nd one looked very much dry & soggy. i personally don’t like my ramen dry or soggy. i like a little sauce with my ramen but not too much so it’s not soggy. so in my opinion i would pick the 3rd one...but tbh they all did they’re best!
You can tell that the guy and the cheetah print girl have never seen real ramen in their lives lol
Why are they making ramen with no water? Are they actually eating the sodium packet? Son, I know why america has heart disease.
Your ramen isn't supposed to be dry, tf?
Nobody: Cheetah girl:  "it has water in it" Me:  IT'S LITERALLY A SOUP, IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER IN IT DUMB....respectfully
the cheetah girl was acting like she was gordon ramsay when her noodles were as dry as the savannah desert. 😃
the girl with the ponytail did the best in my opinion. like who eats ramen dry?? nasty. (unless you eat it straight out the package cause that's good 😋)
“I like my ramen a little dry” *has rat turds in a bowl*
I feel like the 3rd 1 would be the best also  I feel like they were being petty when they scored the 3rd ramen because they 1st said it was good then changed their mind or tried to find something to critique . Especially the leopard print lady I mean she had pretty much nothing hood to say about the guy. Yet the 3rd  she says it's pretty good & she likes the shrimp yet she only gave her a point & a half more.  I mean with the positive things she said at first you would think she got a 5 at least. The only one that seemed to nod be petty is the other female she gave homie a 6 which is understandable & the leopard girl a 0 which by looking at it it's pretty  accurate. I mean it was clumpy & dry I would give her a 0 as well. Which is funny cuz she was the most cocky & hers was the worst visually & by points
I font understand how the 2 lol are complaining about the broth in the last 1 literally the broth is where the flavor is yes the noodles absorb some & u can add stuff to the noodles to give them more flavor but the broth is where it is. Especially real ramen not packaged stuff like where the broth comes from cooking bones along with herbs & seasonings to make the broth.
He do look like a gay as Erkel
I stan cheetah print girl...until I saw her attitude
They disapprove ramen with "water"? Umm...ramen originally is supposed to have liquid! Sure, you can make it without, but in is original form, it is soup based.
.....  The use of spoons instead of chopsticks or a fork... The absolute lack of soup or broth when ramen is literally supposed to have broth...   Why. Just why.
Ramen= noodle soup 🍜. SOUP!
wait why does the ramen not have the soup do yall make it dry or?😂
Why are they eating noodles with a spoon!!
Metal bucket, boiling ring, rice, palm oil, pepper=jollof🤣😂🤤
Ramen has broth
Bro she is gomn
why are they using spoons???
It supposed to have a lot of liquid that’s what it mostly consist of lmao that’s what ramen is. Ignorance at its finest.
I would destroy them with my ramen recipe
Fancy !!!!!?!!??!? The point is to share your broke noodles your not rich
Like sis…why y’all ramen soup DRY?! 😩🤚🏽🤚🏽🤚🏽
Ramen is supposed to be in soup....lmao
“I don’t like all the water” it’s fucking broth bitch!
2:06 “are you tryna kill me *starts fake crying”
It’s just ramen ....... not a full course meal
the ones that talk the most smack has the worst stuff 🤣
I like how their ramen are terrible but they wanna go after others💀💀
That second person ramen looks like trash
first of all the girl in the cheetah shirt was being sooo rude and hers was shit AND the broth is the best part
BRO I CANT THE CHEETAH GIRL SLANDER IS SENDING ME RN
Are you trying to kill me😭🥺   Me: ⚰️
Bruh! The Nigerian girl kills me. She though she was a chef. I am part Nigerian and when I was in uni me and my cousin used to do ramen all the time. We would use nearly the same ingredients but made some broth and put some veg 🤣
how the hell you gonna afford shrimp if you're in college????
Sorry, but if you like dry Ramen then you might as well just eat it straight from the packet without cooking it lol. Like besides the noodles the broth is what makes it so good!
The last girls Ramen looked bomb those other two don't know what they're doing 😖
that ONEE girl 😭😭😭
I wanna know how she achieved such dry ramen
No idea why this was so funny
It’s always the ones who talk THEE MOST that don’t get good results🤣 Sis in the cheetah print, not it Boo!
What do you mean the ramen is watery
Indomie style lmfaoo
How can you be broke and go to college??????? Like isnt college like $50k-$60k??
The second girl literally smashed the dry noodles in the packet and took it out
Olu gives me "Pick Me Girl" vibes...
watching this hurts especially since im asian im not even gonna try and explain
Is that straight out of pocket? Where is the broth? How is this a ramen? When without soup? And why are they making a big problem with ramen having water(broth)  I can make better with instant ramen
Do they know what broth is?
The title 😂
The tittle.. why they gotta be broke tho..
Funny how they're all black
“Broke” 😭
Do you guys not have parents to give you money, how mean of parents  not to give they're kids money just cuz they are in collage.. weird
The girl with the worst one is talking like she’s a master chef 😂
Cheetah girl 0/10
The guy and girl in the cheetah print were embarrassing to watch. They need to go Google what ramen is.
the one girl is the only one who actually made the ramen a soup
I love how she said shrimp and all you see is :🍤  Not this:🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤 Girl said "some shrimp" ......bitch there's one in there😂😂😂😂😂
Why is there no soup to it I like mine to be soupy
I’m deaaaad they were all hella rude for whaaaat hahaha but the girl who won was definitely the nicest. I’m still wondering though if the others have ever had actual ramen though bc they complained about the broth?
This is so funny.😂
All they noodles look nasty
Y they all black
2:24 uh wasn’t you just saying it was to salty like 30 seconds ago ?
As an Asian, I can feel my ancestor’s wrath beneath me.
“they went wrong by getting up and deciding to make it” PLSSS
She liked it but she gave it a 3 lol
5:39 her face lol
Where’s the broth??? 😂🥲 and why spoons
I literally looked up “atatagoon nigerian spice” to see what it actually is this girl kept running her mouth about and this was the first video lol
This girl is crying about ramen
Her - “SEASON YOUR RAMEN!!”   EVERYONE - “GURL please cook your ramen !” 😂
lmao isnt ramen supposed to have the broth in it? 😂
It’s good because the broth.....
Ramen mac and cheese is the best
I watch these in the middle of the night when I'm hungry do I guess I feel less hungry??
I'd body this challenge frfr
This girl acting like she know how to cook like girl 😀
Don't be shy bring some asians
Why is it always the one that’s most confident that has the worst ramen
Bruh they all look gross as fuck.
On the real though cheetah girl fine.
Really had to add broke
Ramen tastes much better with broth *to me* theirs look dry, clumpy, unseasoned as hell- I personally get spicy ramen. add seaweed to the side, put an egg on top, onion powder, saracha, add green onion, garlic into a pan and cook it. Add it into the ramen. And 💛 s t i r 🤍 then you can add fish or fish cakes on top/some sort of meat. But of coarse this is if you want to make a whole dinner for yourself with ramen. Being broke I’d still get the spicy ramen, add saracha, *maybe the green onions and garlic* onion powder and maybe an egg if i had any. (also i keep some broth but pour out a lot because it sorta takes some of the flavor from the noodles themselves)
afro girl was so confident lol girl bye so embarrassing
Us Indians, even if we go broke MAGGI is there to save our day XD add some oregano and chilli flakes to it if anyone wants some extra flavor lol
How dare you disrespecc Raman
Ramen cream of chicken or cream of mushrooms and chicken old bay ..
I like dry and watery instant noodles
"It looks kinda dead" bruhh your noodles dry as hell 🤣
This fucking pisses me off 😤🤬
Why is there no liquid in their ramen and then she's ( girls in cheetah print)going to say the ramen was too salty then she said to season the ramen, make it make sense🤔🥴
Ok but who tf eat ramyun with SPOON??.....LIKE KSJSMJSSJ BRUH?
“Wdym where did they go wrong, they went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone always hates on the nice girl lol
The African girl is so annoying I can’t
Why are they all black in a broke college student video🥸
don't use the lord's name in vain
Over here expecting the ramen to be noodle like when they eating it with a spoon 😑
The title of the vid😂😂

They the using spoon to eat ramen....... ..... ... R U  Kidding  Me
Isn’t ramen supposed to be… watery??
Frozen veges and sasauges  is cheap and when broke u need the broth
Who tf doesn’t put water in their ramen💀.
THE GIRL THAT WON AND THE GUYS RAMEN LOOK BETTER THAN THE NIGERIAN WOMEN SORRY I DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES WHO ELSE THAT THOUGHT THE NIGERIAN GIRL SPICES SOUND FANCY.
Ramen is a soup and u say u like it dry 😂🤣😂
WHY YALL USING SPOONS TO EAT RAMEN
They should put all the anime villains in one episode together 🧍🏽
you didn’t have to add that broke part smh
am I the only one who is dying laughing from that one girl saying "my ramen is the best" and getting last place??
Lmaooo the girl with the Afro said it’s too salty then said season the ramen wtf
Lowkey pissed bc who the fuck doesn’t put water in ramen :D
Ok so it's interesting how different people are
Ramen .... is suppose to have water 🙄🤚🏻
If Cheyenne didn’t win I would have reported the video. The other two didn’t even have soup, they aren’t ramen. Just dry ass noodles.
RAMEN IS LITERALLY NOODLE SOUP  AND THEY’RE WONDERING WHY ITS WET????
Cheyenne literally the only normal one here she the only one that likes broth in her ramen tf and Olu straight up weird she got clumps of ramen stuck together
I like my ramen soupy! Like fill to the top of my bowl liquid soupy.  anybody else or am I crazy? I throw some of those veggies you find in the frozen section, some shrimp but only like 3 cause remember we're broke and some sriricha! yum!
So y’all be eating dry ass noodles? Hell na my juice be filled all the way to the top 😹.
Please her style is not Nigerian 😭
WHY R THEY EATING WITH SPOONS
Is two varieties to make ramen brothless is almost the same way you make spaghetti. One secret you can soft the noodles in cool water for 15 to 20 minutes. Make a Thai Peanutbutter Sauce. Is Banging.
The Nigerian girl is a bit selfish
They all look nasty, not sure how they call that ramen
why the spoon😭
These people mad annoying
Cheetah print girl- “it looks kind of dead”  Everyone- look at your dish sis👁👄👁
1:32 Ok but his little smile is the most adorable shit
It’s fucking ramen… it’s all a zero!
Girly constantly talking about how her ramen is the best while she can’t even cook it properly
Bro they needed some spring onions or an egg or something. Maybe some teriyaki sauce or soy. All of those things are hella cheap and make it 1000x better 🙄
Baby bring me on I’ll show y’all the Ramen Recipe HONEY! Where’s the egg? Where’s the Veggies
they should serve their own ramen and see if they can taste if it’s theirs or not
everyone's ramen look like shit 😭
Olu seems annoying asf
she said said its salty then said noodles had no flavor
Lmao "there's water in it" bitch talked like she knew what Ramen is about and doesn't even know what broth is?
WHO EATS RAMEN DRY???
Ramen is supposed to have broth/supposed to be soupy 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
😂😂😂😂 I wouldn't eat any of their ramen. It all looked weird. But the last one, I might give a chance.
"I would prefer my Ramen a little bit dry"   Me: Oh I didn't know that.
Maybe if cheetah girl didnt spend all her money on her clothes she could afford water to boil her ramen and y did she say ramen like raymen
"It looks grey" babe that's orange
I am happy that the winner was the nicest one.
The girl with the cheetah print shirt what exactly where u tryna make? 😭😩 why the hell was it stuck together in chucks? Ew
Damn my recipe is way better than theirs. And I'm in high school
They don’t look broke…
Why are there no eating shots? Did they even eat it?
Why tf they all have spoons for ramen🤦‍♂️
My ramen would’ve beat all of them 😭
If you liked your ramen dry instead of poisoning the other hosts, just use the uncooked noodles and eat it as a snack *face slap* On the other hand,  Y'all telling me you don't use water for noodles "It's a bit watery"  Well the Instant Noodles Packing: Cook in water for 2 minutes Add the seasoning Y'all instant noodles have 3 ingredients I can't even get how the Cheetah Print Girl could mess that up UGH
They acting like they don’t like Cheyannes then they’re like “lemme take another bite”
Ramen is supposed to have soup dude it's a soup what the friq🤣🤣
Dude this man said that it’s A tsunami bro the water/broth is one of the main parts of ramen keep the water
that african girl got me so mad with her african spices. Like, IT'S INSTANT RAMEN. IF U DONT LIKE THE SEASONING IN THE PACKET, THEN GO BUY SOME NOODLES AND MAKE YOUR OWN AFRICAN TRIBAL HERBAL SOUP
wtf? is ramen not supposed to have broth?
Girl Pretty.
the cheetah print girl: “i’d preferred my ramen a little bit more dry”  her ramen: 🌵🏜
“this shit look dry as hell” ☠️☠️
Why these clowns eating ramen dry lol. It’s supposed to have a broth lol
cheetah girl really failed at making *ramen* and at human decency- she needs to pick a struggle-  and when she said "wack AF" i got second hand embarrassment
But wheres the ✨spice✨
“I smell it so I know it’s safe to eat.” Gurl I think yo Ramen was not safe to eat lol
“This is dry and crunchy”😭🤣🤣
Olu what a dummy .... nosy self righteous a s s
My rule is simple. If the packaging says it should have broth, then it will be. If it says otherwise, then dry it is. Lol. I never betray the “How to Cook”
Ya’ll DON’T know how to eat ramen, that’s what’s up 😂😂😂 but the third one was not bad though. I’d eat that
OmG ArE YOU TRyiNg tO KilL mE 🤢
The boy was so funny explaining the ramens 🙄😂
What’s sad is that I’m going to college in a few years and I don’t like ramen
I love soba noodles..
Peope really sit there and eat dry ass ramen?????? If ypure not eating it raw unboiled-you know what, just have several seats if you eat ramen dry asf lile this. How dare you butcher this food.
“Are you trying to kill me” 😫 heck yeah
I hate how niggas be acting like ramen not soup
Cheetah print is definitely a “pick me” girl lol
Do people not realize that actual ramen is suppose to have soup 🙄
You should not call them broke bro- just because they describe there life like that don’t put it in the title
We have “Remen”
I can't believe they were complaining that a SOUP is it DRY!?!?
All these people are so shady it makes me not want to watch videos like these
My laksa ramen would’ve bodied this challenge gosh i love being asian
It’s supposed to have water it’s soup !
Cheetah girl hyped up her ramen so much and no one liked it
I like how she said "no it's too dry"   But then said "I like mine dryer"   Lmaoo
Why are the noodles so dry 😂
Real ramen had broth in it, it supposed to be soup also
Who the fuck taught these kids how to cook, at least the last student kind of made ramen.
olu is one of those girls who gets bad talked behind their back i’m so sorry 😭
Am I missing something?? Isn't Ramen supposed to be eaten as soup??
This isn't ramen lol it's 2 minute noodles
Ngl Cheyenne's looked the best outta all three
bruh ramen suppose to have broth/soup... like why eat it without the broth/soup
Why y'all picky the idea is to be broke not gourmet
i was so concerned when i saw the first two ramen?? like where is the soupy tasty broth???????
Cheetah was cute. I liked her hair and her earrings. But uh..I’ll pass on the ramen, 🥲
All these look trash …. Ramen is a soup and they all look dry and and salty … lol that was horrible lol 😂
I’ve never had ramen without broth. WTF were those first two doing?
"MiNe aCtUaLly hAs fLaVor, MiNe aCtUaLl hAs tAsTe" Yeah hun, but it aint the good type of flavor
Olu from my country. 🤣 I must say, I like it dry and sometimes soggy(just depends on how tasty the broth is). So, I bet I’d enjoy all three. I’m not a picky eater. My European roomies loved my ramen back in college.
Ramen with cheese is the best!!!
5:37 yh we realised LOL😂🤣
“Shoutout to the shrimp for saving the day” GIRLLLLL gtf dry ass noodles
They....give you packets specifically for broth in every single ramen......there is supposed to be broth
Clearly different cultural taste preferences lol.
"A tsunami hit the ramen" Lmao
Not a bowl of breadcrumbs 😂😂😂
Is Oluwamayowa the niece from the aunt from Sweet Potato pie who said "Where's the favor" cause i can feel her in this video
As a Nigerian: Olu's ramen is a disgrace like who TF makes that
Wait a minute....you mean to tell me Ramen is salty?
Why don't they have broth thooo what
A dry instant ramen is like most uncomfortable way to eat ramen when you take a spoon of it you end up taking the whole bowl ok ok let me give a recipe there's nothing added just instant ramen  Ok first you need yippee mood Masala  noodles (don't add the mood Masala full if u don't like a lil burning sensation)  You need a cup of water  And boil the noodless as usual  But take the noodles out after like umm 50 sec(make sure to stir it)  Then pour it into your bowl (don't drain water)  Pour the Masala (the main Masala for the taste of the noodles and the mood masala for the broth)  Mix it and enjoy  The reason why I like this type it cooks very fast and it looks like a spring and it's very chewyyyyy so yeah
The girl with the Afro coming in with DRY AF NOODLES and expects her to win- and she talking the most crap when she got the lowest rating 💀- y’all should have posted her reaction when she lost cause baby noooooo-
Homegirl Olu really said "I would prefer my Ramen a little bit more dry"   yeah we fuckin know you do😂😂
THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HWO TO MAKE RAMEN FOR SHIT
Asians are punching their hands in the air right now… how do you eat dry ramen?
5:59 have u guys not seen actual ramen- at least hers isnt DRY AND CHUNKY
Y’all know ramens a soup, right?
“I like my ramen a little dry” no you like yours fresh out the pack with no water, then throw some seasoning on it. “Who ever made this tried” nah YOU DIDNT TRY. Cheyenne was better, yours was a whole dessert
the first one kinda looks good tbh the second one too
They hate on the girl who ACTUALLY MADE IT RIGHT. It’s supposed to be like a soup, she added broth and they’re mad. They’re some weirdos
My ramen:  Vegetarian soy sauce pack Hot water Vegetable stock  Paprika Chili powder Onion powder Garlic powder Diced onion and garlic Dab of salt Pepper Peas and carrots A ton of Cholula😂  P.S. you can make it watery like this, but, man, it’s even better when you drain it mostly, add some oil, and cook it in a pan and let that water evaporate and absorb. Add a lil more sauce tho😂
Isn’t ramen supposed to have soup in it 😭 why are the other twos so dryyyyy
The ill-informed carpenter histopathologically listen because hydrofoil aerobically blind unlike a six cardboard. homeless, odd hyena
Watch her not even get a good score  This is an edit and I told you!!!!!!!
Bye, literally they complaining abt adding broth. Like the broth is good too 😭
i eat ramen everyday. mf it's supposed to have BROTH 😐
Chunks of Ramen omg that’s disgusting
talked all that shit just to get a 2!?!!??!? sit down please
I cringe at how he pronounced ‘Maruchan’
African person disrespected by American whitebleached black kids
When I heard her accent I was excited when she said she was from my country Nigeria I was even more excited that she's like rep-ing I was expecting something good or atleast average now all I feel is second hand embarrassment 🤧 maybe it wasn't her best day, hopefully she cooks her average Instant noodle better than that.  Edit: I get the fact that she's not used to the broth I don't think I've seen any Nigerian cook instant noodle and deliberately add broth.
0:11 her hair 😍
Idk if it’s just me but I feel like it has to do with them being black….
“there’s water”💀 you mean broth
They dont look broke
A spoon ? Really
do they know rice is cheaper? or even potatos?
You know how the girl said “you tryna kill me with the salt?” And then said “the only think that has flovour is the chicken” lol like bro make up your mind😂😂🥴
How that girl cook her ramen without it catching on fire from being dry
Did he just say moo-roo-Chen 👁👄👁
the other two who lost are the kind of ppl I’d always try to avoid communicating with. especially this woman.
I like my noodles with waters I can’t stand it being dry and sticky😭....
Who tf puts crayfish in noodles...
“i don’t like all the water” bae…… it’s called broth…. ramen isn’t supposed to be dry LMAO
Girl stfu (olu)
you can always tell by their attitude who’s gonna have the worst one LOL🤣 & the way the complaining about a little soup when ramen is literally traditionally made with a broth 😭
"This sh*t look dry as hell" 😂😂😂
What all these people made is not ramen hahaha, literally if you made ramen noodles and let it sit for a week.
My 12 year old makes better this, like why is it so dryyy!!
A little MORE dry
Lil cheetah mamaz had mad mouth,  but came in with bricks
“i like my ramen a little dry” girl no, its supposed to have broth 💀 not straight outta the pack 😭
bitch how is it unseasoned *and* too salty?
I know how miss afro puff was so salty and petty LOL but it was her that lost the most
What???? You're telling me these people don't eat their ramen with broth???????
Lmao its always the people the criticize the most that have the worst rates
These all looked so bad
Bruh do they not eat ramen? Ramen is supposed to have soup JUS LOOK AT THE FUCKING RAMEN EMOJI 🍜
I’ve been cooking ramen since I was 6
...yall is 20c a pack, tf yall mean 'it has no color' OF COURSE IT DOESNT. ITS 20 CENTS😂
When "I'm Nigerian" is a personality instead of part of the story.
Why are they acting like ramen isn’t a traditional Japanese soup style dish eating it fucking dry wth is wrong with y’all
I would prefer my ramen a little more dry, yeah we know. Yours came in as rock clumps 😐
aint ramen basically soup?
I love how Olu is so proud of her Ramen but then her score plummets. Lol
“I brought my nigerian styled remen”
2:17-2:37girl shut up. Ain’t nobody there like your ramen but you sis.
Ummmm im asian and we eat our ramen watery like with the soup do the watery one look best to me though idk who agrees cuz idk dry ramen?
Should Ramen have water
Who tf is eating Ramen whit a spoon ;( disgusting
Ngl I thought the first two hadn't cooked theirs it looked so dry😖
"i like my ramen more dry".  "it looks flooded. its too much water"  So not only are they broke, but they dont read the ramen directions either? Who the hell has dry ramen? Its supposed to be wet you weirdos. if you want dry noodles, make a stir dry  lol
Why are these people over complicating ramen? Its just ramen their treating it like its some gourmet meal.
i don’t like the girl with the curly hair she too cocky & need to humble herself 😂
Yall dont put chocolate milk in your ramen noodles
Naw if you like your Raman dry leave
Where did y’all find the 2 people who eat ᗪᖇY ramen noodles??
Otawamammamwam aneed to get some flava
Y'all don't know that the way we cook "ramen" (noodles) in Nigeria is totally different from ramen ramen
Ramen is supposed to have broth... why were they tryna play her for it not being dry?  None of them looked appetizing. Lol
How are you Nigerian and still lose💀
I just love how Olu was all NEGITIVE and only ended up getting a HIGH SCORE OF 2!!! Gurl she boosted her ramen up so much and it was a total FLOP
The last girl is actually how it’s cooked. It’s supposed to have soup.
2:45 the hypocricy. Grrrl, you okay?
"I perfer mines to be a little bit more dry" Yeah bitch we could tell- 😭💀🔪
"It looks like it got flooded "
Cheetah girl: “This is just dry its not cutting it for me”   Also cheetah girl: “I like my ramen a little on the dry side”   *huh*
"I don't like all the water in it" have these people ever eaten ramen before???😭😭 that was physically painful to hear
Olu swore she has the best ramen LMFAO , her shit was dry and looked nasty compared to the other 2
Bruh she thinks everything is good with attagosoddnwndd
Ramen is SUPPOSED to have “water.” Who really out here eating parched noodles ? “It’s actually really gooodd.” Yeah dummy. Cause she didn’t pour all the flavor out with the water.
Of course it's gonna have a weird mushy texture when it is sitting for 20 minutes while they're interviewed. Ramen needs to come from pan or microwave to mouth.
This gotta be fake...being real is entertaining also. I know y'all want views but come on🤦🏽‍♀️
Dude I mean they complaining that the noodles have broth like... it’s ramen bruh u have broth
I am a Nigerian and my Ramen is good we put spice and stuff but we never put salt
yall wanna try my homemade ramen bruh 5star chef rated lol no cap
Umm why do they eat the ramen with a spoon?!? This giving me Drake and Josh vibes 😂
“I prefer my ramen a little dry”   Yeah we know....
The scariest part is how bad raman is for you.
Ramen is meant to have a broth. Dashi and tare. And its meant to have vegetables and meat and eggs. There are too many variations to cover it all but yeah.
Also, when has ramen not been beige? The color comes from the stuff you add into it? Like veggies and meat. The noodles themselves are going to be beige, that's not gonna change...
Add hotsauce, lime, and cilantro
Do other people really take all the water out of their ramen? I always eat my ramen like a soup not like pasta? Unless I'm using it for stir fry...
I would never eat the two dry ones. I like my ramen with some broth. Next...
I got the same thought as Marcus when olus ramen came out💀💀💀💀💀
We all think we’d win this challenge
The way Olu bribed about her Ramen , I thought she would win
“Broke collage students” Ofc they all black
Why all of them look dry 😭
"i prefer my ramen a little more dry"
The title is offensive-
I hate mushy noodles and I hate when they're not cooked all the way. I would say even girl number 2's is a little too mushy looking. I don't like a lot of water either. Some... but there was too much in that bowl. Extra seasoning is cool... but adding shrimp or chicken or anything else... why? Just have a nice triangle sandwich on the side and you're good.
The puffy haired one is so irritating. I can't stand people who are all talk and rude but can't do shit.
It’s the spoons for me.
It’s probably because I’m Asian and my family eats ramen extremely often, and I’m sorry, but I am so scared rn
You guys casted the wrong people for this. Why are people hating on ramen with broth? Ramen are suppose to have broth or else it’s just noodles…
The nigerian girl has disappointed me. Nigerian ramen aka indomie is lit as hell. Its normally a whole delicacy. How can you do this to us?
These ppl have no clue what ramen is or how it should be made
“ Are you trying to kill mehh?”  Girl.....
They don’t like the water?! Ramen is supposed to have water!
Swear I thought they said broke I make my noodles just with water and the pack and then boil it lol
At this point, this whole mean persona comes off fake, like it's a producing thing. Why is there always a mean participant who has th lowest score almost everytime ?
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon
RAMEN IS SOUP. GIRL IT AINT SUPPOSED TO BE DRY LMAOO
Marcus woke up and chose violence LMAOOOOOOO
its them eating ramen with a spoon for me
All that shit look disgusting.... not only that, those noodles been sitting so that messes with the texture of the noodles... all this is horrible!
How they gonna be “broke college students” and still be picky😭😭 id eat it anyway if I’m hungry bro
This is the exact reason I try not to act cocky & rude when I'm presenting something to ppl lol the result speaks for itself and you may get humbled
“This gives Spanish vibes, my mom is SPANISH”??!!!
Tell me why no one has their broth in the ramen except Cheyenne 😭
There acting like ramen ain't supposed to have broth😭
The girl with the cheetah print shirt is getting all my nerves
The zonked neon obviously move because patio dfly force concerning a giddy anger. repulsive, harmonious reward
learn something that will get you in dept just to make less than 80k a year and take you years to pay back, fuck no, go out their and hussle
Nobody gonna talk about how they eating noodles with a spoon
Fucc Ramen lol ate one pac in college
literally making top ramen straight out the package with the seasoning packet would be better than the first two 😂
You know it's scripted when the bitch with the afro says "So much salt, are you trying to kill me?" Bitch it's a fucking pack of ramen with base salt from the seasoning packets. My word how do you even pick your contestants? It must be a random lottery draw these fools you've had on for the past few months don't know what they're doing. This is why shows like Hot Ones succeed and you failure channels fail. You're quite fake, non ideal guests who complain for about 40% of the video. Your show sucks because there is no host,  no way to carry on the show besides the guests comments. You need to redefine what your ideal is, if need be hire me I can help this shamble of a channel.
That's not even the right amount of soup/sauce for the ramen and they're complaining.
Why are we eating them with a spoon??!!!🤦🏽‍♂️
Broke college students can’t afford that shit I throw some tonys and some cheese and call it a day
Atatagoon not enough atatagoon are you trying to kill me. She probably eats atatagoon out of the bottle
I’d use one packet of soy sauce and peanut butter (to taste) Keep broth
what do you guys expect she's nigerian
The rudest most annoying girl there thought serving cold, mushy, soggy ass blocks of uncooked noodles was gonna be good. Lol
Y is it not cooked ?
Olu needs to be humble. Her ramen was HORRIBLE. SHE NEEDS TO HUMBLE HERSELF. PERIODT.
they were really hating cheyenne's ramen when hers was the best
They acting like ramen is a 5 star meal or something 😂😂 it's fucking shitty noodles, don't act like it's a full ass meal
all these look gross... is all ramen from the US pale-looking like that?!?!? have you SEEN the asian variety
I’m sorry but that ‘Nigerian’ ramen is very not Nigerian. That looks like a 2 day old food. I’m embarazzd
R a w m e n
These people are dumb hahaha u won't have a good ramen for sure bcs it's a broke version LOL
uh, I think ramen suppose to have soup right?
Wtf I'm broke too ...so first thing putting water increases quantity u become full easily and second thing ramen MUST have soup/broth/water whatever it is and thats why I'll buy an instant ramen rather than wasting my money on expensive chicken shrimp cheese other sauces they used they dumb af at this rate these broke students will go even more broke😐
The chunky ramen tho
fun fact: everybody has to pay for parking and books
WHY DID THE TWO OF THEM SAY THERES TOO MUCH WATER??? BRUH ITS A SOUP..
Where is the broth
I make mines spicy with the broth like I don’t know why nobody has broth and there’s and Olu can really shut up because hers was the size of chicken nugget like it was bite sized bites like what mad Dry bro
Wait water ain’t suppose to be in it???
People eating ramen : Mmmm! It’s so salty and good! Cheetah girl : *Yea no, it hate it. It’s salty.*
The 1st and 2nd ramen just looks like they doing the most the 3rd one actually looks good especially with the shrimp
Girl with the wig was killing me like chilll out
Wdym u don't like water, RAMEN IS A SOUP
“Why are the two people acting like it’s not supposed to have water?” Perhaps because black people generally don’t eat it as a soup? It’s a cultural preference - the water is drained and then it’s typically eaten dry or near dry with only a tad bit of the “broth” remaining. Hence why they were both surprised to see an abundance of water or “soup”. I think people tend to forget that cultural differences, in terms of how food is made and eaten, varies across the board or at least they don’t know what to do when confronted with it. I.e. Growing up, my family and friends preferred method for cooking bacon was in the oven. That’s how our parents taught us and that method was passed down from their parents and so forth and so on. I had no idea that bacon could be cooked or was cooked another way until I went to college and learned that most of my friends (who were white) cooked it in a pan on the stove. I was shooketh and so were they when they found out that I cooked it in the oven....  Respect each other’s differences. They aren’t intentionally hating, just surprised as many black people in America (especially low income neighborhoods) don’t eat ramen in soup form.
The jolly guide hisologically end because toothpaste accordingly report until a wakeful fir. flimsy, thankful pepper
I've never IN MY LIFE, SEE SOMEONE EAT RAMEN WITH A SPOON
All of them would have got a 0.  Who eat dry ramen😭😭
Just gonna put it out here olu is a straight sassy bitch and I laughed like hell when he said "This shit looks dry as hell"
Nigerian girl feeling herself and her spices too much lol...
The girl who actually seasoned it with asian sauces and added water like you're supposed did it correct. The other two don't know that real ramen has water in it lmao
5:38 yea we see that lmao
I know people are competitive but I don’t like hoe they already try to hard to find something bad, like if you like it, it’s okay to say that😭
“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry” sis we know hahahahaha
Cheetah print and the dude never had soup before I guess 😂 where’s the broth????
Remem 💀
Bitch said color of the Ramen makes a difference
olu was being rude asl..
So we not gon talk about how they eating ramen with a spoon?  😳🙄 Ok...
lol Marcus literally looks like Sid the science kid.
PLS THE WAY THEY ACT LIKE RAMEN ISN’T SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH😭 y’all can’t judge when you don’t even know how to make it!!
This video really has me CONVINCED that these contestants have never had ramen in real life 😂
Who eats saimin with a spoon? Lolol
Never trust a person that says ram in
Bro that one girl with the lowest rating is over confident
These college kids jus suck
*"Its too salty, are you trying to kill me!"* *"Season the ramen, the ramen matters"*
nicest always win
I thought the first guy should’ve won, both of the girls seemed like they liked it from the start. They were being too stingy with their scores. The Cheetah Girl was too busy talking about how great hers is. She was inconsistent, first she said it’s too salty, then said the noodles lacked flavor. And the other girl was just being a lil picky about the texture.
1:50 “this looks like mine”  no the heck it don’t🤣🤣
I'm fresh outta japan and so I can easily beat all three of them
Girl w da afro gotta go😂
Girl w da afro gotta go😂
Olu embarrassed Nigeria that day
They didint bring any Asian people because they would’ve bodied this lmao
homegirl said "this looks like mine" no yours was chunky sweetie
I guess they don't know that Ramen is Japanese noodle soup. Since when is soup supposed to be dry?? And these folks graduated college lol. I guess they sure didn't take any culture classes lmfao
Dry ramen lol
That Nigerian girl need to calm down. She acting like she not broke and she a world known chef
What is tagogu
3:15 its BROKE NOT FANCY DUMBASS
She did all that to get a 2
Ramen is supposed to have **BROTH**
You guys are so rude and the one y’all disrespected is the one who was being the nicest
Y’all damn collage students are hella racist
Girlie took the “broke” challenge way too seriously 😭🤣
All there ramen dishes look so disappointing, likeee where is the egg? And where is the spicy broth!!! what the heck
IS RAMEN NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SOUP. IM SO CONFUSED.
Idk the way the Nigerian girl talks upsets me 😂
I like how it’s always one person that’s unnecessarily rude and they almost always lose lmao
Nigerian style where??? Don’t embarrass us in public with your sticky noodles!!
I think their instant noodles all look unappetising.
Wheres the egg?
Why they got a spoon
For a second I thought I was crazy for always making my ramen with lots of water when everyone was shook that there was liquid in the last girl’s ramen. Then I realized (through the comments) that I am normal for having my ramen like that 😅
That girl did not just say “my mom  is Spanish” girl what?🧍‍♀️
it's crazy because ramen is literally a soup so there should be water in it. i personally drain most of the water bc i don't like it but it shouldn't be dry to the point where the noodles are sticking together in clumps😭
Why they have them eating with spoons?
“Shut down the studio 🗣🗣” I’m dead 😂
Cheetah really said “it’s so salty are you trying to kill me” bout the e boy, then says it needs seasoning
ramen is soup it's supposed to have water i was so confused why the first two were so dry
She said her mom is Spanish and I hope that she means from Spain cause I really hate when people refer to all Latinos as Spanish
We’re is the soup  WEREEEEEE
I haye olu
Dang these broke kids be picky too
I am just done
i’m nigerian and the ramen my family makes still has broth idk what the cheetah girl is on🌚
They don’t know how to cook ramen !!!😭
Isn’t chicken the only favor the is 😂
I am asian and these people piss me off. What the hell are they doing? Have they seen an actual ramen or not?
The title is the epitome of teen comedy.
bro they dumped the broth and expected to still win🤨
I’m not trying to be rude but this is disgusting like what is this- bruh
i hate that ugly cheeto print bitch
The used bathroom encouragingly form because stop terminally float apud a forgetful rooster. educated, guttural H habitual team
I eat my ramen watery🥴🤣
Not me going back to respectfully hear her pronounce her name twice 😭
I mean the ramen is watery-my asian roots deadly annoyed And like the other ramen was dry  like if u dont want soupy ramen atleast put a paste that will coat the ramen like blackbean ramen
That third girl is the only one who even made ramen.  The other 2 just used the noodles.  I'm glad she won, justice prevailed.  Second girl talked a lot of smack for not having any proteins and not even cooking her noodles.
''It has water in it'' yeah neh you can tell she fried hers without water
Girl what - doesn’t ramen have broth in the bowl
This shit dry af -the dude 😂😂😂😂😂
Why is no one taking about how she said “ra-men”?
He said “they did wrong by waking up” 😂 😂😂 I’m going to tell my husband that next time he tells me what did I do wrong 😂😂😂
What type of ramen don’t got broth what in the actual f...
Crayfish to ramen!?!? Girl bye!!
WHY TF IS IT DRY⁉️⁉️ RAMEN IS A SOUP‼️‼️
"It's a bit watery" bruh... it's a soup
I KNEW the snarky Naija girl’s food would NOT be right. 🤣🤣🤣 Her hair is cute as can be though. ☝🏾
Wait what... is ramen not supposed to have soup in it 😭
Is ramen noodles?
Ok, I am a 14 year old who cooks better than these people! They should be embarrassed most of them can barely even make Ramen properly! Here is a Ramen recipe for you guys to try: Add more than water, make it soupy for a broth, add better than bouillon vegetable base, add aromatics like ginger zest and shallots, add sauces like sambal, siracha, miso, fish sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce chili garlic sauce, add meat and vegetables, and season it well. I know this is supposed to be a cheap ramen, but go to dollar tree for some sauces like sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, or hot sauce, get some canned veg or meat, and maybe get some cheap spices, there. Crushed everyone. But people probably have better ramen out there, just a suggestion. In my opinion the best one is the last one......Wait till these people try real ramen in Japan.
the winner was the only good one
Im convinced olu’s noodles started covid 💀
Imagine if gordon ramsey was reviewing their ramen
that one girl was pushin it doing a little to much for the cameras
I would probably lose as I don't add anything in my ramen just the packet that it comes with haha
i need the girl in the cheetah social 😂😂😂cause she was taking that shittt
It’s olu being rude and getting a 2 for me .
Why did they give them spoons to eat with?!?! Am I the only one who thought that was weird
dang I came here thinking collage students would be chill

The Nigerian girl irritating me

Almost 100k likes Whoo!
Remember contestants, as the title says you are just broke college kids 😂😂😂
It's really intrresting how non asians eat instant noodles.
The boy is doing to much
i don’t understand how none of them realize that they are broke
the girl that got a 2 she just got the ramen straight out of the pack and crunched it up put her stuff in there and ate it LMAO
“It’s salty are you trying to kill me?”
BRUH RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH WHY ARE Y'ALL DRAINING YOUR RAMEN!?!?

Neuroscience girl needs to stfu
The descriptive chief inherently answer because white nouzilly enjoy pace a tenuous icicle. vague, lyrical wood
the girl who got a 0 is so rude for no reason??🤨tf
i love the girl with ponytail,she can cook,she's pretty,she so polite!!!
To give the show a twist they should meet each other after trying all the food
Why are they eating it with spoons????
a couple haters on this show
0:01 if only shake sauce saw that part lmao
y’all don’t fuck with the broth ??? that’s the best part
I like mine a little dryer but at least mine tastes good
The last one actually looks like traditional ramen... Whenever I go to eat at Menkoi Ramen House, it looks like that.
BITCHES DUMB ASF- THAT ISNT WATER IT'S BROTH HATERS
To much water? Do you fry ur ramen or somethings, it’s supposed to have water it’s broth
Lol, how you upset that ramen has liquid in it? The heart of ramen is literally the broth. I'm so confused and...embarrassed. Also, my ramen slapped in college. This ish is wild trash.
THE FACT SHE WAS USING A SPOON TO EAT RAMEN 🍜🥄💀💀💀👽👽👽

Most packets say Ramen noodle SOUP so serving it dry is odd…
He said “this shit dry as hell”😂🤣🤣🤣🤣

Cheetah print gurl gave me a bad vibe
Would love to see the reaction of people who score less 😂😂😂
I get spicy ramen add dryed shiitake mushroom, carrots, garlic and peanut butter.
this title is so tone deaf lmaooo
Why the absolute fuck they think u sposed to eat ramen dry jesus america is fucked
Idk I normally put boiled eggs, black pepper, salt, tapatio, like a splurge of lemon(not lime), and a bit of cayenne pepper. Then I will eat it with like some saltine crackers maybe
my friend and i live  together (were in highschool but her parents kicked her out and so did mine so we got a house) and making food is so sad...  we refuse to use the stove, just the toaster and microwave... TACO BELL IS THE BEST ngl  i don’t eat a lot tbh
I’m eating ramen rn. Something about eating it in the middle of the night hits different
Y'all they don't know what broth is-
Its crawfish not crayfish
Olu is so full of herself lmao
Lol she can’t decide wether it’s salty or has no flavor
The one talking the most smack always has the worst one
They sound stupid af....
Have they never seen ramen before it literally is supposed to have broth
SHE PUT IN SHRIMP??? yall were supposed to be broke
“broke” puts in chicken damn
Do they know Ramen is a soup...
girl in cheetah print wanted to hate on that girl ramen so bad knowing she like it 😭
The comment section 🤣
Why are all of them so dry 💀💀  Edit: Nvm Cheyenne looks the best
Why did I get excited when ol girl in the middle won. 🤣
How can you use crayfish in ramen? Serial killer vibes
1:47 Spanish is not a race either Puerto Rican Cuban or if she was both just say Hispanic 😑
girls actin like they boujeee for that ramen ISS ramen
IM DEADDD😭😭 this video got me crackin up😂
Who tf is to dry as Ramen? Ramen is supposed to have broth. ( in my opinion lmao )
I would’ve win because all their ramen looks dry..I keep the broth in mine lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I feel bad for the second girl man
P.S. How in the hell would “broke” college kids be able to get and prepare fresh shrimp? 😂😂😂
Did sis really complain the RAMEN was “too salty”?! It’s always the people with the worst takes in these that talk the most s**t 😂 I think their insecurities are showing...
You don’t need Ramen.... I used to go to fast food restaurants when they were busy. I would grab a fresh receipt from the garbage. I would walk in and tell them I did not get my burrito or burger etc.
Olu:Lou prefer my ramen a bit more dry.         olu later:this ramen is just dry and.                 Actually switch it around srry
One of the people; it’s to salty   Most of us: ITS POSED TO BE
But why are they eating it with a spoon?!?!?
Ngl all of em are rude but the afro girl won the trophy for rudest
The girl with Afro rlly made me just wanna  👩🏾‍🦱🤛🏾
both of the girls have these long pretty names and the guys is just like hey waazup i’m marcus but i love all their names
Why would y’all give them spoons for noodles?
Ngl broke college students dont know cooking at all lmao
THEY ACTING LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER HAD RAMEN BEFORE ITS SUSPOSED TO BE WATERY
They do understand ramen is a soup right?
As an Asian......what are these ramen..... just add spam and zucchinis and you’re good
That "kid" look 32
As a Ramen master, Ramen usually is soupy- those Me Goreng and other stuff that is dry isn’t usually regarded as “Ramen” in Asia
“I prefer my ramen a little bit more dry”  You don’t say
This was a hella creative idea tho
americans
“oMg ArE yOu TrYiNg To KiLl Me?😭🙄😕😢🥺🤬😳🤯”
Dry ash 😅😅crunchy
"This ramen has water" Have you never seen ramen before?
First off Ramen is SOUP...  Okay. Secondly...what you chose to put in your Ramen is on you....but REAL AUTHENTIC RAMEN... has fixing. Like the heck? And spices...... Smh
Where are the forks
They over complicated this.... all you need to do is add a lil season salt, and some hot sauce.... also if you can afford shrimp and oyster sauce.... you’re not a broke college student....
WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE EATING RAMEN NOODLES WITH A SPOON?  America is broken beyond repair.
wish I could see cheetah girls face when she lost miserably.
Why are they eating noodles with a spoon ?
Cheetah gurl got a rating of... 2?
I hate this
I’m starting to think they tell the ones with the terrible dish to be on their worst behavior. I always know who the loser is from the beginning lol
“I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” LOL WE KNOW SISTER
“ like are you trying to kill me🥺” “uwu” ugh the cheetah girl is so annoying.
i stopped watching as soon as i noticed nun of there noodles had water in it
How to make packet ramen in a microwave and make it still taste good: Step 1: Get a bowl and take out the ramen out of the bag, and crush it in the bowl Step 2: Pour Water into bowl with ramen in it (Any Temperature) Step 3: Place bowl in microwave and set to 1:00 Step 4: Take out bowl and place plate on top of the bowl and place in microwave for 2:00 (To let the steam flow) Step 5: (The Bowl will be hot, so grab a rag and hold the plate.) If you don’t like soup with your ramen just put the plate against the bowl and let the water spill out without spilling the ramen out. Step 6: Pour Flavor Packet and mix Step 7: Enjoy and make sure to blow your food because it will be hot!
Lawrys hell no dude.
Bruh people this day don’t know how to make ramen isn’t it supposed to be like a warm soup 🍲
"Broke girls" 😂😂
🥲who cooks ramen in such way
"this ramen is watery" yeah besties noodles are dry, ramen is noodles WITH A BROTH. lol
The cheetah girl was judging them os hard and telling she has 'different vibes' till her ramen aint even cookefully🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Broke college kid: It needs more shrimp
Im confused by the fact that they were steady slandering the only Ramen that was done right. Ramen is SUPPOSED to be in broth. It's supposed to be soaked and served in broth. Glad Cheyenne still won, because she deserved it, but geesh...
Y’all ramen has broth?? I’m so confused. What’s with the draining pls
Who deprive these kids of their water because I have never heard of anyone saying that soup is too watery
How do broke college kids afford shrimp and?  Asking for a friend....
Shrimp and oyster sauce does not depict a broke college student lol. She worked that thang though and came out with the best noodles. I would have let my noodles have some broth too, that's the best way to make ramen and then drink the soup afterward so I don't know what the other two were talking about with the water and wetness and stuff. And when homegirl said crayfish and the other dude said lime I was like no sir and ma'am. Doing too much loll
Since when have ramen not been soup ??
BRO SHE SAID REMEN
bruh how the nigerian girl is gonna say OMG ITS SO SALTY then say it has no flavor like tf?
"my ramen is coming in with a new vibe it is coming in with a new flavor" girl the only thing that it is coming in with is clumpy dry gross ramen
That girl annoyed me with her stupidness🤦 the ramen watery😂😂
Why cheyenne look like she could be Porsha from RHW daughter😭💯
They do know ramen is supposed to have broth not just the noodles... ramen is Literally a noodle SOUP!!!! 🙄🙄😡
I’m pretty sure you add water or Broth to ramen, I personally add water.
Not him saying that the ramen got flooded 😂
What the heck is under the goon
My shit is stupid and simple lol, Soy Sauce and Siracha sauce along side with lime
This is something I can actually participate in lol
lol i lost it when the girl with the big hair said she liked her ramen a little more dry lmfao...but ramen is actually suppose to have freakin broth in it...but as americans our parents did not know how to properly make it so we drain the water
They are some hatersssss
i don't know.   9.5 winning score cant be good ramen.  although it was the only ramen with broth.  i am not sure why anybody thinks ramen isn't suppose to have brother &/or be served dry.  poor babies
I love the fact how it’s titled “broke collage students try each other’s ramen” it’s ramen either way right?
Olu talkin trash but she didn’t even cook hers
Hahahaha. Y'all do know ramen is a soup. 😂
The cheetah print girl had NO right to talk about the other ramens like that 😭😭😭
Ramen seasoning packet water ramen sesame oil 1 spoon of  white miso   Add kimchi make your own spicy lime chili sauce crack one egg
bruh they complained that the ramen had broth?? if you don’t keep the broth in your ramen what are you doing
Sis in the cheetah print was doing entirely too much and then had the nerve to make the worst dish. Ma'am. Humble yourself or be humbled. Lol!
Um ok but why the gorls giving hella attitude for some mf ramen 🤣
The ramen matters(RLM) 🤣🤣
Do people seriously think ramen isn’t supposed to have broth?? “Looks like it has water in it” ITS BROTH
ramen a bit watery wtf ramen's eaten with a broth lol
Man I be puttin some tobasco some some egg some paparika half the chicken packet in there some black n red pepper I make sure that it's like soup noodles like idk why everybody had no liquid in there like whaaaa ur supposed to slurp it up ya know
I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone get a 2.. but I’m glad it was the cocky one lol
It’s always the biggest shit talker who’s food taste like old grout. Be humble because in the end it’s less embarrassing
It's her confidence for me👀
I prefer my ramen dry NO YOU PREFER IT UNCOOKED SIS! lol
Bruh I’m just imagining cheetah girl after watching the video crying cuz she got a 2 while scrolling through this savage comment section
What a Gordon Ramsey wanna be
5:38 yeahhh no shit
What are we doing. Watching broke people eat each other’s ramen.
pls donot call this Ramen . Please
I'm rocking with Marcus on this one. Hot sauce +lemon + Lawry's. No broth = GOAT 🐐
Wtf why are they using a spoon
I can’t believe y’all really out here eating dry ramen
Bro they were all wack!!
Bruh, it’s honestly sad that I’m only 12 but I can make a wayyyyyyy better ramen than any of them✋🤣🤣
Marcus sweet on the low
that cheetah print girl annoyed me the second she said "af" also do they not realize ramen is supposed to have broth...someone save them all
Don’t know how these morons got into college
Doesn’t like soup in ramen...?
Are they eating ramen with a spoon 💀
I’ll give y’all my broke college student ramen recipe (even though nobody asked)  1/2 Pack of Roast beef  Bell peppers  Onions  Hoisin sauce  Ramen of course   Put the meat and veggies in a skillet while the ramen boils, add hoisin sauce then the noodles. Stir. And boom 💥
Yo cheetah girl needa chill damn
These niggas know that ramen is soup right everyone but the girl with good food the only one worth a damn

Not “is that a hair” 😭😭😭
C'mon man. Who complains about ramen having broth...
Its salty but...the Ramen is unseasoned...Girl
This was a try not to get annoyed challenge for me
Imagine gloating about your ramen and then losing🙃
Big hair she's a hater
The cheetah print girl needs some serious help....
WHO EATS RAMEN WITH A SPOON THE HELL
The first two made ramen loaf. It was so dry.
2:49 in and I already know who I hope doesn’t win! Someone needs a lesson in humility. Wow.
Ramen?? That is a ramen?, *laughs in asian*
Wait do americans eat ramen dry? Are you insane or what is it
Mayowa put crayfish in her ramen?? That is not a flavour you introduce people to in a competition setting 😭
Why do some people think that broth/water in ramen is weird? I thought it was supposed to
who tf eats *RAMEN* with a spoon..?
All they shit was weird
I have never eaten my Ramen with broth, and I have been eating it for years. There are ways to make it moist without the broth.
“There’s not enough shrimp” bro the whole point Is to be broke
Cheyenne thank god she won. Bro she.. to me hers looked the most appealing to me and her ingredients made sense in my brain. I’m happy.
“They went wrong by waking up” this man woke up and chose destruction for real.
And you’re eating it with a spo-.... oh my god... have I been doing something wrong since I was little or something???? I’m so confused man. My brain hurts.   Lol it’s really interesting how you find out people do things different then others.
The first problem with all of y’all ramen is I don’t see NO broth and it hurts. Y’all eat ramen like my father. What if you’re cold? You Jay want the noodles?
“I like my ramen a little more dry” baby we know.
I like how she came out with clumps but is saying  there's is nasty
The brainy license sicily undress because neon coincidently soothe from a luxuriant vest. cute, precious marimba
Cheyanne look high as hell
she didn’t use the right seasoning, I wonder what algoon taste like (idk if I spelled it right)😭Ik my ramen is the best tho 😭 with broth ✨
Dude, I’m sorry to tell you this but you’re going to be broke for a long time. Good luck with musical theater tho👍
LMFAOAOA "its salty like are you trying to kill me?"
This isn't Nigerian styled abeg . not cheetah girl giving us cookies or nuggets
Japanese people be crying at both the video and the comments...
the cheetah girl was not the move
Why are they eating it with spoons?....
Ramen is actually supposed to be a soup-like dish, so Cheyenne's made more sense.
Who the heck eats ramen with a spoon...that’s just...messed up...
yall deadass picked the worst 3 ppl to do ramen like whatt
The girl with the fro was just talking about her ramen she kept saying myyyy ramen like girl we get it
“They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it”😭😭😭
i’m confused is ramen not supposed 2 have broth??? why r those 2 acting as if it’s not?
SOMEONE SUMMON CODY KO
Bruh all of them were rude lmao
We already knew who’s Ramen would be the worst 😂😂
In Asia, most countries have their own spin to like Instant noodle packets, but most of them are generally soup/broth based ESPECIALLY RAMEN! Instant noodles packets are supposed to be perfect little packets of goodness, YOU JUST NEED TO GODDAMN FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKET!!!
This should've been titled: "Black people try each other's ramen."
I am YOUNGER than cheetah brat and I am not fussy. My food would be good.  Cheetah girl: Cocky and obnoxiously over confident 🤢🤮 She is way too biased.  The only male: overall stupid-like RAMEN IS {£^{**) WET, IT HAS BROTH, YOU ARE ASKING FOR NON JAPANESE NOODLES AS MOST NOODLE DISHES REQUIRE LIQUID. AND PLZZZZ, LIME?!》XD WTF.  normal girl: The victim, the girl who followed ettiquite and was fair... yet she still gets treated like garbage.
Ok she said it was salty but wasn’t seasoned? They do realize it is soup that is the cheap college student meal right?
The barbie looking was doing the most I know she was hated in school
This was annoying to watch
just gave em indomie bruh
how do yall like ramen dry what
The willing environment lily doubt because stepdaughter commonly shop save a ruddy barge. better, gray greasy great algeria
Marcus woke up on the wrong side of the bed😭😂
most ramen comes in a soup. why did two of them have dry ramen
Y’all ain’t never had good ramen till you try an Asian persons ramen 🤌🏼
Obviously these well educated individuals don't know that Ramen is noodle soup
Ew dry ramen is the worst as soon as she said shrimp, oyster sauce and sriracha I knew she won, but the chicken and lime sounded good too just needed broth and maybe top it off with avocado, salsa, and cilantro
Nah but i was broke and made better ramen than them fr idk what type of noodles they buying and yes you do need to have bit of broth
She went from it's too salty, to nothing has flavor but chicken.. you can tell who be lying they ass off in real life for no reason
wtf do y’all get out of hating???😂
they do realise ramen is a soup style dish? smh
cheetah girl, you is not Gordan Ramsay STFU  💀
yall saw how cheetah girl was talking smack but then hers was worse 💀
Why they mad about the ramen having broth like whatt
2:06 so dramatic
Lets eat ramen with spoons
I ain’t gon lie all them noodles look the same should’ve picked people from the hood
all these raman’s so tragic
Bro the cheetah girl so extra
The clumps ramen looked kinda gross
Cheyenne defo had better ramen that’s how it’s supposed to be . Why the other two so damn judgy
😒She sure did embarrass Nigerians 😩all that attitude only to make garbage
This video pissed me off so much LOL like what do you mean too watery or slimy? It's supposed to have broth!!!!!! I feel like I'm in the twilight zone lol
Awe i wanted to see cheetah girls reactial to being LAST
Why are they using a spoon?
Cream cheese (a lot) , Soy sauce, tomato paste, and some sriracha will make a top notch ramen dish.
All of their Ramen looks gross and why are they eating with spoons🤨
Why does it not have broth? Also I’m so disappointed. You have to put a soft boiled egg, thinly sliced beef and serve with dried seaweed sheets
The last girl’s ramen is fire I already know 😂
pretty sure it shouldn't really be called "ramen" at this point if it's so dry, it should be called "pasta" 😂
A bunch of rich kids
Is there a reason there's always in three ppl? I'm so used to seeing at least 4 ppl in these types of videos so I feel cheated lol 😆 if u can add one more person pls
Did she really just say Spanish vibes🤦‍♂️ you mean Mexican 1:41
How I make my ramen  1. Get ramen packets  2. Boil water 3. Put noodles in 4. Idk how you explain this but cook it 5. Add all the rest of the seasonings from the ramen packets
I bet Asain people are laughing. RAMEN is supposed to have water y'all. It's broth.
I'm 13 and I make better ramen then these casuals.💀  Everyone in that video can hold this L for the rest of their life.
“i prefer my ramen a bit more dry” SIS WE KNOWWW💀💀
cheyanne is so pretty and she seems so sweet ahh!!
Bruh ramen is literally supposed to be soupy not dry. 😃✋
i like mushy noodles
*the cheetah girl going on about how amazing her ramen is when it’s not even COOKED LMAOAHDSJ💀💀*
Who eats ramen without soup
“ I prefer my ramen more dry.” Gurl your ramen was so dry it was a BLOCK what did you cook it in? Grass?
Yal aint never added a dollup of peanut butter though?! 🙂
why is there no broth
People tripping I’m on my sophomore year at college and started a e commerce business freshman year and that pays for almost everything I still be eating ramen with tapatio lemon salt and pepper real Mexican style
Cheetah girl is so SASSY. She was like I gonna win this and her Ramen was the worst.
Lisa Nguyen be like _rookies_
Ramen has broth mfs 😂
The girl with the afro has clearly never had proper japanese ramen before. who tf says "this ramen is a bit water"
Man y’all DUM
wait who decided to give them JUST spoons to eat ramen with...?
Lmfao cheetah girl is a joke
The title 💀
Ramen is definitely better in the broth
Girlllll what the hell , Ramen supposed to be watery... you are the one who eating them in wrong way 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 just shut the f**k up.
" i prefer my ramen more dry " ... ur ramen was str8 up uncooked queen . the word dry shouldnt even be allowed to come out of ur mouth
i’m nigerian and as a nigerian who grew up with someone who likes to put crayfish in their ramen.... i already knew she wasn’t gonna wjn that. it’s so nastyyy crayfish and ramen do not work 😭
For the first one she said it’s over seasoned yet says the only thing seasoned is the chicken and the ramen needs seasoning
RAMEN IS MOSTLY BROTH... im scared of these people
These people are so dumb RAMEN is literally supposed to be watery and soupy lmao why weren't any east Asians in this??? smh
Cheetah girl got on my nerve! 😑 Gone come with that deadly ramen then have the nerve to talk down on everybody else stuff
you need to show the reactions of the other contestants who loose!!
the fact that the rudest ones got the lowest grades make me happy
First of all when the girl the cheetah shirt tried the boys ramen first this she said was it’s SALTY then she said the only thing in the dish that has flavor is the chicken “ season the ramen “ but i thought it was salty ???😭😭😭 dummy
If you like water in your ramen drop this emoji 🍜💧
so 2/3 of these people don’t know ramen’s supposed to be served in a broth????
How it's broke college kids but they have shrimp and chicken! This a new level of broke guess
“I prefer my ramen to be a little bit more dry” girl....clearly 😂😂😂
They gave them spoons... to eat noodles?
I am so sorry..... These guys can't cook... No offence to any other country but indian kids have better broke food recipes...and I am not taking about Maggie
Their hair are so pretty it matches them
water? That is broth? Like wtf-
LMAO it all looks grey 😭
I would not even begin to know how to pronounce her name lol but she's beautiful all of them
“I like my noodles a little bit dry.” WE KNOW!
5:35 "it has water in it, i prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" A LITTLE BIT????? oluwamayowa please...
Girl, you're embarrassing us nigeriand
The cheetah gurl is like I gotta smell so ik it’s not bad like girl your ramen was chunks and hard so u shouldn’t be worried
Cheetah girl is over ther acting ungrateful saying yea this food is unseasoned and thinks that she gonna win but her ramen dry as hell like I make better ramen then her
Also, who told the girl in cheetah print ramen was crunchy?! Did you not read the directions on the package?? Like WHAAAAAT?!
“It’s too watery”?! Like TF IT’S RAMEN! Ramen has broth!! Also “You need to add more shrimp” UH, hello!!! IT’S BROKE COLLEGE RAMEN! Shrimp is expensive!
Over confident on nigeria
The cheetah girl is so annoying
College kids can buy a little shrimp here and there. Cheetah girl opinions are just awful and it makes it better when they say, oh yeah, that shrimp ramen is pretty good. I bet she likes a well done steak that even an alligator couldn't bite through also, but don't season that steak
Lol they don't like water on the ramen ???  Lol
The brought their ramen ??? Not cooked there itself ??? They soggy bro
I wish the let the contest rate each other but also send it for the final rate from real professional so all can be equally rated fairly that would help
Me as a kid can make better ramen  👁👄👁
Lmao i know these people are broke college kids but americans really have no concept of what ramen is. Ramen sits in broth bruh. wHaT iS tHiS wAtEr
I feel too bad to be takin a bunch of 💩 I’d just say I don’t like it😭😭
Man I should’ve made some noodles I bet u I’ll win
2:44 this bitch is annoying!!!
Olu:"Too salty" , but also "season the ramen" Olu: Your ramen looks grey  Meanwhile her ramen looked horrible and clumpy. Whattt!?
cheetah girl: my ramen is coming in with a different vibe with a different taste it’s gonna win everyone else: df is ts ??🤨
That cheetah girl bout annoyin ash
it looks likes all of the ramen sucks
why the fuck are they eating with a spoon
WHY THE FUCK ARE YALL EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON
Ramen but they don't like it with broth? WTF?
Who eats dry ramen????
Um O girl why is your ramen DRY and In Chunks but you tried
These kids was brutal
I knew cheetah girl was gonna lose. She was way to confident over some straight out the pack, splash of water noodles.
Okay IE 😎
Anyone notice THERE EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON?????
No egg? No soy sauce?
That word crayfish doesn't sit right with me.... They are crawfish dammit... CRAWFISH... AND yes I'm Louisiana 😊
where's the broth ?? lmao
Cheetah girl was mad annoying but Marcus had me cracking tf up 🤣 he said issa clump 💀
2/3 have useless degrees, and 1/3 has a degree in a specialized field lol.
am i the only one who doesn’t like olu??
I thought broth with Raman was normal until I saw these people being dramatic about the broth 😂
iktfl. They're mad because her ramen AKA SOUP has broth in it?????
Shake sauce best reaction
I have not watched the trying part of the video yet... but the most humble person always wins so im going to guess the winner was Marcus. I also guess Oluwamayowa is going to lose because she seems to be the most abrasive. Lets see if im right  Edit: I got 1/2.... but marcus wasnt as sparing with the criticism as i thought he would be lmao
I prefer my ramen a bit more dry GIRL we can definitely tell
Alternate title ;  - Middle class black college kids try each others ramen
Someone pls tell me what happened to the seasoning packet that came with the noodles 🍜😭😫
What triggered me the whole video was the spoons lmao. Especially on the part where the noodles were actually long- 😭
It's literally noodles how can they not make that
The cheetah print girl is fucking annoying
All they Ramen sucks, They didn't add no good seasoning no good seasoning. I add season salt black pepper slap ya mama and garlic pepper so.
Are they eating noodles with a spoon?
That curly hair girl is one of those annoying ass "Elitist" type people.
The one girl was like: ThIs HaS nO FlaVoR iTs NaStY. She just wants her ramen to win so she trash talking everyone else’s
First of all why are y’all eating ramen with a spoon-
wait i didn’t know having broth meant it was watery... my whole life is a lie
How can you bring ramen?!😩 I make mine with the soup and if its over 10-15 mins it soaks up too much, gets mushy, loses flavor, and heat.
3 minutes on the stove when it boil pour some water out add redhot and soysauce. hard ramen
The girl in the cheetah is lying how are you going to say something is salty but then say it’s unseasoned like wtf 😂😂😂
Wait till they find out that ramen is mixed into water...
how they not gonna like the water thats literally what makes ramen the broth..
Olu stfu your shit was dry asf 💀 you have no room for a opinion

“I prefer my ramen a little more dry..”  SIS, YOU LITERALLY UNDERCOOKED YOUR RAMEN😭
The girl in a cheetah print  Did alot if talking 😭😭😭💀she better learn to cook better.
Some people lie so they can win and then end up not winning
1:49 “this looks like mine” no. Yours was a brick
Why is everyone hating on soupy ramen? It’s the best with some lime and hot sauce yum! Or with cabbage and carrots oh so delicious
Them: making dry ramen Me: boiling a whole pot of water to pour on the ramen 🍜 👁👃👁                           👄

https://youtu.be/Gk8fcGkx_Qw
"I was soooooooo broke in college"   Adds shrimp to ramen
Stfu how y’all fuck up ramen 🍜 like 😅I’m scared...it says add water and seasoning..add some lime or tapatio that’s it! And there’s so many flavors like what ?! blows my mind 🤯 just buy a different flavor ....
Why does everyone all of a sudden hate ramen ?
this video disappointed me it’s ramen noodles...japanese noodles soup..y’all just ruined ramen
yall idk bout u but i dont like soupy ramen
“it looks kinda dead” AND YOURS ISNT?
cans of vegetables are cheap.  Why no veg?   And people...soup?   Anyone ever hear of soup?
They did Ramen wrong honestly ive been broke almost my whole life and i can promise you ive made way better Ramen then this!! People in prison make better Ramen then this wtf! ALSO RAMEN IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DRY😡 idk why this hurt my feelings LMFAO I'm truly offended 😭
Juice! mine gotta be juicy like the last girl's.i knew it would win
Lesson learned. A little goes a long way! I dont like all the extra stuff done too it!! Too much 🤢!!!!
ye, homeboy and cheetagirl aint never had asian food before looooool
I like my noodles dry 😁 Millions of people here in Nigeria and around the world probably do too. It's normal that cultures & traditions are different and people don't always like the same thing 💁🏾‍♂️.   (PS when we make dry noodles, we eat it within few minutes after it's ready... That's probably why it's extra dry)
RAMEN. HAS. BROTH.
how hard is it to cook ramen. really y'all??? it is a cup or so of boiling water, add the noodles till soft then add the packet and stir. them eat. easy peasy:) I mean the directions r litterly on the package.  lol
ramen's lives matter. :)
Olu: "I think mine is gonna win!" *continues talking trash*  *Olu still loses*
Afro girl acting like it wasn’t about turning broke food to good broke food like gurl you have high standards for broke food
That cheetah girl did the most with her talk yet her ramen came looking like cement
What are their comments??? Ramen has broth. I make mine dry. You can make it anyway. The cockiness. It's ugly. Just try the damn food.
All these folks eating ramen with spoons... smdh
So I'm the only one that eat noodles with hot sauce(Louisiana), cheese, and ranch? 🤣🤣 damn mf the pack 15 cents.. why everybody trying to make them fancy all of a sudden
idk cheetah girl didnt rlly pass the vibe check
Excuse me do they not realize Ramen is supposed to be in a broth??????
Where is the broth...where is the egg..the cheese....where are the fresh veggies....etc i have never in my life seen ramen that looks like this that is truly beyond struggle
Not enough shrimp, guys you're broke and ramen is soup hence water. Tf?
Pls afro had me dead talkin bout "I like my ramen dry" well no shi u barely cooked yours
That cheetah girl makes me mad asf
Why those ramen don’t have broth. You eating spaghetti without sauce essentially
Cheetah girl acting all that, when her ramen not even cooked all the way like dude sftu-
Y’all really don’t know how to cook or prepare actual ramen
but to be fair which BROKE collage student has money for shrimp? that shit is so expensive
“Broke college kids”
Hi 🙋‍♀️ dear nice video...guy’s let’s gather here for selfie 🤳
These aren't ramen, just some dried noodles.
No offence but I feel I could make better ramen than all of em..
“Whoever made this tried.” 😂 a Nigerian through and through. Yoruba at that
buy korean ramen n make ur life easy🙂
The girl with the fro….sis why the food don’t even look cooked 🤣 also they tripping the noodles are ment to have water with them
why the fuck are they eating it with spoons
Yall are broke but have money to buh shrimp and shit .... like ... please
How did this happen to you Karl wheezer? 😭
Is it me or does Cheyenne girl sound like Meghan from bad girls club 😭
"The ramen is to watery." Ahhh that's why homegirl won.
Cheetah shirt girl GOT ON MY NERVES
eating ramen with a spoon was the first red flag
The fact there isn't any broth...yeah....second what broke college student can afford chicken, let alone seafood?
I understand the type of ramen the Nigeiran girl is trying to make but it's just errr, a waste of ingredients 😕  Ma'am u add the opportunity to add Ata gun gun and crayfish well but u messed, E gbe nu dake jare 🙄
Broke🤨 do you have nice clothing jewelry and one has there hair done
I like how all of em are black🙃
It's always the most cocky and kinda arrogant that be doin the worst... loool no cap tho, I liked Cheyenne the best and I somehow new she'd do the best too AND ALSO... YOOOOO Ramen is SUPPOSED to have water, tf y'all havin it dry for??? lmao
ramen is watery uh? people eat ramen without the broth? that's weird
Why they complaining about the soup like bruh
The way he said “Maruchan” Made my cringe
The cheetah girl talked a lot of ish just to have clumpy ramen..
NO- Where tf is the BROTH
All of them ramen made me sad...lol
Tbh ramen with the soup be real instant ramen because that’s how we eat it in asia.
It doesn't have to be colorful ramen, it just has to taste good
Omg this video is kinda sad 😂
ramen is literally a soup style dish why tf are those 2 ppls so dryyyyyyyyy and then they're hating on the girl who actually used broth like. HUHHHH
as an Asian, Cheyenne's ramen looks the most legit for me. the others aren't bad. they are creative and were prepared to their own cultural taste (and consistency) which is awesome.
This shit look dry ash 😂😂😂ahhhh I’m dead
Y’all tripping… where’s the green onions, paprika, thyme, parsley, chicken or shrimp with a fried egg on the top?
Have y’all realized they be eating noodles with a spoon wtf lol 😂
What is ramen without broth? 💆🏻
The lean forecast complementarily answer because substance behaviorally lock off a kindly liquor. wooden, dispensable advice
you had to put broke in the title😂
ngl i dont think these people know what ramen is.
Eating ramen w a spoon :/
No need to try making it your own. Just buy some good ramen. Maybe get some Korean ramen with the type of broth you fancy (I like Neoguri for the seafood taste) and maybe and some boiled eggs, shrimps, done. If you like it without broth, get something like Chapaghetti or Japanese instant soba or indomie Goreng. There are so many instant noodles that just taste great out of the box guys. If you want real fried noodles then just skip ramen and get real noodles. I don't care how broke you are, you literally added shrimps and chicken.
5:35 “It has water in it, which is ok I guess. I prefer my ramen a bit more dry” LMFAOOOOO YES WE KNOW U DO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol i was rooting for Chy from the beginning!!
I would hate to be her teacher 😂😂
Arrogant prick. Y'all know who I'm talking about
I put garlic salt. Salt a d pepper and sometimes hot sauce in mine and if we still got food stamps I'll put some baby shrimp in there
What broke college student can afford crayfish??????
The girl with the cheetah print she about to get slapped she is so rude
Olu: “I prefer dry” Me: sis- I know yours was freaking *crunchy*
Soupy ramen or fried noddles .... You can eat both ways and still they taste good if you are good at it. Adding colour to rammen?  It’s noodle! Just add colourful veggies in it. With the least effort and creativity just get indomie in your shelves!
I wanna know how broke kids are getting shrimp mofos dont have shrimp money like that  in college
... ramen is soup??? It should have broth... a lot of it?? 😳
The cheetah girls sounds like a pick me 😬 Nigerians 🙄( no offense)
If they are "broke" then where did all that nice jewelry come from
Generation Z is something else. Parents teach your kids how to cook and shop frugally.
Bro as an Asian-American these ramens offend me 😂
Ramen is suppose to have broth...so y'all 2 stop acting as if it's not suppose to...it's just your preference to make is dry
Why does the title say “Broke college students” could’ve just left it as College students...y’all are something else 🤦🏽‍♀️
Riverside!!!!
Cheetah girl talking a lot of s***
The ramen is too watery?? What??
The dude gives me a phenomenal vibe ✌🏻✌🏻
They just want to put down the other Contenstent 😵😈
Who the fuck eats ramen without the broth
Ramen isn't supposed to be perfect, its supposed to be some good shit you eat when you got nothing else, this cheetah bih trynna make it look like her ramen was made in a 3 michelin star restaurant...
I feel like none of these people were broke
It’s just ramen how different can it be. It’s pre-packaged and has the same amount of spice mix
Bruh can't believe contestant 2 is talking trash her food isn't even cooked🤣
Those 2 ppl that were talking shit was getting on my nerves 😐
all of their ramens were disgusting wth
Y'all dont eat your ramen with broth?... Couldnt be me eating no dry ass noodles
Theres not enough shrimp, theres not enough shrimp.  Bruh are you dumb, broke students cant afford so many ingredients. Stoooopid
Y’all know that ramen has a broth right?
"it has water in it I prefer mine more dry"
They definitely all know each other lmao
Bruh cheetah girl is trying to flex. What is she flexing?!? Her clumpy ramen!??!
The LAST ONE IS ATLEAST A LITTLE SOUPY. but also um.....do....do they not KNOW RAMEN IS A SOUP?!?! ITS SUPPOAED TO BE WATERY, with a BROTH or added sauce mind you. But....it's soup.
this is legit? feel like you just trying to make people look stupid...
cheetah girl gives me real “pick me vibes” “I’m being serious,not trying to be mean or anything, I don’t like it,” “It’s salty” “aRe YoU tRyInG tO kIlL mE?”
Not yall coming after the cheetah girl when the guy literally judged them both 💀
Aaaaaah, the joys of asian culinary knowledge. Besides, maruchans noodles have nothing on the texture of shin yun noodles. Though, the spice is hella intense.
3:11
Of course they have two women and a gay guy why would they use a straight man? They’re illegal now
lmfaoo the title 💀😭
Why’s their hair on point but their ramen is like bleugh
Wow, the title😂😂
they supposed to be broke but throwing in shrimp and chicken
I've noticed the people who are the most judgmental are the ones who make the worst things lol  projection much...
the pack says ramen noodle SOUP like its SUPPOSED to have the broth or else its just Spaghettie smh
Okay but...why are they using spoons-
How the girl in the leopard print gone say the first bowl was texture was off...... but hers was way off 😂😂😂😂 the nerves of her
I’d beat the breaks out of them with my Ramon noodles they won’t stand a chance
It behooves me that the first 2 didn't have any broth in it. Like who's really out here eating dry ramen.
Did she intentionally not cook her Ramen?
Cheetah girl makes me mad😐
I wouldn’t be in this video all black people and the label broke
Nobody is going to talk about how they ate Ramen with a spoon tho? What 😭
Cheyenne  sounds like Portia from RHOA.
Cheeta girl be actin like she a 5 star chef like damn hers wasn’t even cooked
“shout out to the shrimp for saving the day” 🐆🤪
How she gonna say it's tastes salty but then says season your ramen WTF
My cousin go to riverside college
Why do they have spoons for noodles...lmao
Why is noone talking about how awesome Marcus seems?
Cheyenne fire and she made the best Ramen. That's exactly how I'd make mine if I had the shrimp and oyster sauce lol
I make mine like Cheyenne does but I’m curious about the guys version too. Looked good
I don’t get it tbh ramen is ramen
Broke kids can get chicken and shrimp? :-D
Let me on the show and make some
Cheyenne sound like glitter sunshine  rainbow cake 🥺🥺🥺🥺idk

They’re eating ramen... with a *s p o o n*
All their ramens look disgusting not gonna lie
BRAZILIAN RAMEN = BEST RAMEN.
I’ve NEVER had dry noodles before !!! I’m so confused
girl had the biggest head thinking hers was the best but she had the worst
I'm an Asian and the ramen in this video offends me sm
Bitch made ramen into chunky and thinks shr can say sum bout others
As an Asian.. They are eating the ramen without the soup & with a spoon.. uhh ok….
so we have uhhh, whatever marcus did, rocks and actual ramen
Uh aren't yall meant to use forks to eat ramen...?
Why even call it ramen at this point
It's always the broke ones who looks expensive and rich like wtf did the earth collapsed?
Ramen is so salty are you tryna kill me 3 secs later omg it so bland the only thing with seasoning is this dry ass chicken
She was bragging like her ramen actually is going to be good and this is why I have trust issues
Can I make ramen fa this Bc they do what they doing
XDXD  I just want to ask  why  XDXD  Honestly.. If you are broke and you wanna eat something  good  you just  need  pasta garlic ( fresh ) chilli 🌶 and olive oil and in Italy we call pasta aglio olio Peperoncino 10 min and wonderful.. also CHEAP!! 3 DOLLAR  MAX
Has he not had sopa
why did the first 2 look SO DRY??¿¿
How do u go wrong on ramen
Y'all telling me....the juice isn't one of the best parts of ramen? I live for ramen noodle juice
Bruh shorty was out here talking mad shit when her ramen out here looking like dried dookie clumps
Girl if you can afford shrimp you do not need to be eating ramen
“The ramen is a bit watery” hun do you even know what ramen is?
“The ramen is a bit watery” isn’t ramen supposed to be in soup anyway????
why those two acting as if ramen can't have soup when theirs look dry as hell and that girl with the Cheetah print shirt you don't gotta talk when yours ain't even cooked smh
Cheetah girl is a hater man... It is the ones that don't know how to cook that talk the most stuff. I honestly sensed her energy way before the tasting started. The other two were just honest and didn't lack confidence and had no hate. Lol like she crunched the noodles up and added no seasoning. Hell, she was better off taking it back and just do like we did as a kid and ate it dry in the pack. They probably would've given her cool pointers. 😂🤚🏾😒
“it’s watery” uhm i’m pretty sure ramen is supposed to have broth👾 noodles and ramen aren’t the same man
"I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" GIRL WE CAN TELL!
Whats marcus @👀
They don’t taste Indomie yet-
It's always the one who talks the most shit with the worst food 😒😒
Olu was annoying, and fake boujee and after all that couldn’t cook herself smh
This is ramen? Wow..major fail whoever came up with this. Should do your homework on the food before releasing this trash. Lol
callin them out with no shame
Is shrimp cheap in America? That shit is too expensive in France for my broke arse
Why does cheetah girl have to be so stuck up tho...
Ngl the girl who had the watery ramen was my fav I would love her ramen
As an asian, this is such disrespect to not expect ramen to have BROTH. Oh nahhh, lmao.
Best ramen chefs: Inmates>broke college students.🤫
They would love my noodles
Oogalaboogala or whatever the fuck her name is literally was HATING on my guy Marcus
The nigerian girl is literally the young version of the black grandma on that buzzfeed video complaining on the lack of spices in a sweet potato pie
Me looking at their ramen all yellowed colored like girl get yourself some Shin Ramen or some indomie but y‘all just aren’t ready for it
Shieeet Heyyy Cheyenneeeeee
You man do not know wtf is ramen
All my jail cats, red beans and rice say less
can someone teach these people that ramen is most often a f**king soup! lol. mans are afraid of broth. like wtf...
cheetah girl “this is too salty” (marcus ramen) a few seconds later “the only thing that has seasoning is the chicken” didn’t she just say it was too salty then she come back saying the only thing that has flavor is the chicken?
Yk cheetah not broke when she can’t even cook or pronounce ramen
Ofc there isn't a lot of shrimp it's called, "Broke College  Kids Try Each Other's Ramen" for a reason. Also, do ya'll know what ramen is? lmaoooo

“I like my ramen a bit more dry”  Girl we KNOW

5:39 my exact thought was “oh honey we know.”
The girl with the cheetah print shirt talking bad abt other ppls ramen and she don’t see the faces of the ppl eating her ramen lmao
You guys are really good at finding these meanies for your videos, like in pretty much all your vids have them, they're the flavah we need😂
Ramen is a soup, it shouldn’t be dry.  The winner was right.
She tries to be so different is so annoying
Olu..girl ya shit wasn’t even cooked 😭🤣
What the hell kind of ramen are y’all eating that doesn’t have broth liiikkkeee that’s the whole thing ugh 🤦🏾‍♂️

I feel like cheetah print girl was jus desperately searching for reasons why the peoples ramen would be bad and she didn't even look at the plus sides at all
Cheetah girl: Makes ramen dry dry  Later: 5:38 YA YOU DO SIS

Why the cockiest person food be the worst every time 💀
“I’d prefer my ramen a little more dry” yeah we know babe. Do better

That Nigerian girl was getting on my nerves lowkey

The girl who talked the most shit has the worst ramen yuk
Why are all the ramen look dry and unseasoned 😭😭 Do they really consume ramen like that there?
BRO  you does really know the one that going to lose inno 😭😭😭
Miss Cheetah is a hater, how is she going to say the first noodles were trying to kill her with salt and then later on say it had no taste. Pick a lie sis.

Broke college kids .... putting some chicken and some shrimp... they're not broke at all wtf.
RAMEN IS SUPPOSE TO BE SOUP WTF

“Ramen is a bit watery” it’s suppose to have water, it’s ramen
“i like my noodles a little bit dry” girl you like yours straight out the pack w 2 teaspoons of water 🙄
"I wish it was a bit dryer". GO EAT SPAGHETTI INSTEAD
Bro my 12 year old brother makes better ramen then cheeta looking girl
Cheyenne was cute a f and here ramen looked bomb. I'm glad she won!
😂basically all they ramen nasty
Pov: you already knew what I was gonna say when you read "pov" but you went to the comments to see if anyone else noticed the drama in this 7 min video
who eats dry ramen you don't be eating it with the broth?
~"It has WwAAaTtTERrr in it"~ sis dats called brothhh bc real ramen is a soup u uncultured dry ramen eaters   -not hatin, just statin- :’(
Ramen is supposed to have broth in it though...
i know that nigerian girl mad when she watched this 😭😭
Olu talking about how good Cheyenne’s Raman is “I’ll give it a three” like what?!-
Girl with the Afro was doing too much, like damn.. say you don’t like it and move on.
I can't believe people eat like that
Cheetah girl is the the microwave ready for Gordom Ramsay.
Cheetah girl:"Its salty"  Her 2 seconds later: Season the Ramen!
Cheetah gurl talked the most shit and had the worst rock hard ramen
Isn't ramen a broth?
Why are people saying Olu is the girl in the cheetah print. It's Leopard print.
The other girl's looked the most normal. Ramen is supposed to have a broth thought the consistency differs from person to person. I dont like mine to be dry, I like it to be moist you know?
I just know, KNOW, that anyone who uses MARU-CHAN... bro. No disrespect to others but I don't eat ramen noodles that look like they were made from white companies. Because they always end up tasting bland. I hate Mr.Noodles like wtf is that. I only eat the good stuff: Mi Goreng (Indonesia), korean spicy noodles, nongshim shin ramyun, and some other asian noodles that idk the name. Plus, I hate dry noodles. WHERE'S THE SOUP BRO. I love ramyeon a lot
The spoons and no broth? 😂😂
I already knew the Nigerian girl wouldn’t win because I too am Nigerian and I most definitely knew that the other two wouldn’t like the spices, plus the ones that be talking the most shit be the ones losing
Who else is here from Shakesauce?
The Japanese are crying rn
I feel the first 2 is against the law.......its like taking pasta from your cupboard and eating it w just so.
You "have to pay parking"? I don't think you're talking about your bike miss broke.  I guess real poor people aren't easy to find in hollywood where buzzfeed is records
Human being shouldn’t consume this 😟
I mean i drain my ramen too but like do these people know ramen is usually is soup form????? 😭😭 why are they so confused by the broth???
My god these people saltier than league.........it's just fucking ramen not a 3 hat dish......
I don't care about what anyone says I  love my ramen soupy  coz dry ramen  just ends up becoming a clump , except certain brands of ramen , like they don't become a clump when they are dry
The trash talkers always make the worst dishes. At least that's one consistent lesson in this show
Nahhh mine would’ve won 😭 if you like flavor it would’ve won. I put eggs siracha,hoisin, cilantro, green onions 😌✋but I also eat the non white ramen sooo yeah
me in the first bit of this:  "this is a variety of people, sure everyone will probably have different taste i don't think it will be a valid contest, not like you can screw up ramen and from there, add your own flavor.. makes sense"  *me after seeing this video*  oh no, all i ever known, why is soup being called water and why are people preparing ramen like seasoning a bag of chips. I'm confused
Imagine eating ramen soup without the liquid in the soup😂, y’all cali niggas might be dumb. I ain’t never seen someone eat some ramen with no broth 😂😂😂
I prefer my ramen dry. No shit sis, they compared you ramen to a bag of saltines.
These people are really eating dry ramen with spoons
I feel like 2 of them just completley forgot what regular ramen taste like and also it's a soup, when giving there opinions an comparisons
Why uwawawa girl ramen look dry it not wet. Did she even cook it
do people not relise that ramen is SOUP like who df eats ramen DRY🍜
Man, were these kids broke or not? How y'all gettin' any toppings for your ramen? All I had was a pot of water and some chopsticks.
Y’all do know that ramen is supposed to have broth right?
Why is it that the ones that talk shit can't cook.
BUT what exactly is ramen in America??
First of all Ramen without soup is NOT ramen. Secondly, y’all are suppose to be broke college students so why would there be enough shrimp?! Thirdly, who eats ramen with a spoon only? This is all wrong
All of them seem a bit picky
Serious rass question isn't Ramon suppose to have water 🤦🏽. Home grill in cheetah smh a mess
Okay maybe it's a cultural or foreign thing but my college broke meals mean chicken back verses ole 🐔🤷🏽.  My Jamaican ass ran boats inna america never 😂😂 if u know u know
all their ramen looks bad to me i usually put black pepper seasoning salt garlic and onion powder (not a lot) and hot sauce. Not for everybody but better then theirs
My broke college go to food is actually tortilla soup I can make a big pot of it for less than $15 and it will LAST you
They in college and using a spoon to eat ramen
I like veggie Raman and just enough water then add butter and fresh herbs to have an buttery creamy Raman.
The one that was honest won 🤷🏿‍♀️
im sorry but people dont eat ramen with soup? what
They need a fork first off and you need noodle juice and also the noodles supposed to be straight
"There's too much water" tf, it's frickin ramen!! What did they expect?!? Its supposed to have broth.
I literally just put the packet
Thats y the girl w the afro eat straight Ramen
I just want to know one thing... why are these ramen so dry🥲 where’s the sauce 👀🧐
The black shirt girl is legit the only actual good one
Wait, ramen is supposed to me dryyyy?!
The puffy hair girl/thing talk like she can cook shit and hers not even second😂
After making my way through a couple of these vids I wonder if Nigerians having huge egos is a pretty common stereotype.
where do you guys find these ignorant, arrogant ass people
Olu is judgemental  she got 2 lollll She's looking at the color wouldn't want to play a game  with her omg lamo🖤🥵🖤🥵🖤🥵🖤🥵🖤🥵🥵🖤
There not enough shrimp it’s called  the broke college students like bruhh are you dumb bro
i was expected 3 of the same chicken flavored top ramen
Ramen....too salty? Ma’am it’s packaged RAMAN
I love how the people that talk the most shit always have the worst dish
I do not trust ANYONE that eats ramen noodles without the soup (unless it’s designed for you to remove the water, BUT the noodles still end up with a sauce with some liquid)
I love my Ramen with liquid.  It’s ramen noodle soup.
The first two was trying to play it off like they didn't enjoy the third girl's ramen because she actually made it correctly! Rofl!
Why are they acting like Ramen isn't supposed to have broth
Bpt🤟🏼🖤
Dat Ramen straight evaporated or you ma’fuckas don’t use no water damn 💀
*The ramen is wet.* Sure.
Yall eat yall ramen with a spoon??
Afro girl is pissing me off!
Olu talking the most shit but hers was the worst
I like my noodles with some juice they trippin
All of them nasty
“Broke”  🤔 why they all b-
This is my new favourite channel
Ramen is soup lol it needs a broth
It just goes to show how the youth judges so much by appearance these days. But they are just college kids so oh well
Why are they eating noodles with a spoon
I thought ramen was supposed to be a soup? Maybe, that's what I know.
I love how the rudest people always gets the lowest rates
I feel like none of them know what they’re talking about
ok but they’re all very pretty 🧞‍♂️
WHY ARE THEY SHOCKED THAT RAMEN HAS BROTH IN IT?? the other 2 had the driest ramen ever ! Wowwwww 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ is it me who’s wrong ? Aren’t u supposed to put water into your ramen to cook it? Y’all I can’t 😂😂😂
What she talking about it has no color, what you want it to be purple?💀
Why they eating it with a spoon😭😭
she is making us nigerians look bad now 😒, but most nigerians prefer their ramen (indomie) dry but i love it with broth x
I think there is a problem with the rating system, whoever is the saltiest wins
Delete this video Wtf you mean you don’t eat noodles with no water
BROTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF RAMEN. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
How could Olu someone who has probably had Indomie 100000000x make something like that?
All their ramen sucks, i add chives, boiled egg, thin sliced chicken piece of bacon fresh greens. Like wtf these people doing
How do you complain about it being to salty then turn around and say season it 🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂
Ramen SOUP
What the fuck  They all get zeros
Cheetah girl: my name is owbaisiwnagqiensjs  Me: Who? 👀
She ate ramen with a SPOON😭😭😭🤚🏽
i don’t like cheetah girl
Miss cheetah gurl acting like Gordon Ramsay
Damn sis did Nigeria wrong
Why are they making ramen dry 😂😂🤔pack says add water so what they add little water and drain it ?
THE CHEETAH GIRL AND THE DUDE GOT ON MY GOD DAMN NERVESSS OMLLL
olu is so annoying
These people use Fiji water for there ramen.
The fact that Cheyenne has Spanish upbringing already gives her an advantage
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRY RAMEN AND SOUP RAMEN PACKAGED RAMEN IS MEANT TO BE SERVED IN A BROTH
the cheetah girl is BUGGING babe your noodles were ROCKS LITERAL ROCKS  PLEASE-
Ppl in prison eat dry ramen, not dry n crunchy thoooooo n in prison we use cheese squeeze.......none of these mfkas don’t kno wtf they talking bout
OMG 😳 lol
WHAT ARE ALL OF THESE CONTESTANTS' PROBLEMS?!?  IT'S FUCKING INSTANT RAMEN. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. LITERALLY THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS THE MOST IN FOOD IS THE TASTE! COLOR IS NOT AN INDICATION OF FLAVOR!
Ramen has soupppppppp pleaseeee
Hell no, post ole girls reaction to the 2 😂
When Olu said, “I like my ramen a little bit more dry,” I LOST IT. Her ramen wasn’t even cooked!
Never use the seasoning packet in ramen unless absolutely necessary. If it comes to that only use 1/4 to 1/2. Sesame oil, soy, saracha.
Cheetah girl: Its salty has  Also her: Has no flavor  Me:🤨
This is universal lol
Non of these bitches don’t know what ramen is.
You all would’ve lost UK indomie slaps better as a uni student 🤣
There's Ramen and there's bowls of noodles. These are bowls of noodles lol
"My Nigerian style ramen-" GIRL NO😭
Why couldn’t they just say college students instead of calling them broke

You gotta get creative if you're living on ramen😂If you don't want soup ramen, you can boil it, drain it and stir fry it afterwards😉 Get some chilli pepper, garlic, onions, eggs, hot dogs, and any veggies you can afford into that frying pan!
i just see the person who made the ramen in the corner of the video smiling while they all make harsh reviews on it LMAO

I personally love my ramen soupy, but I add extra flavoring and a little hot sauce lmao cuz I like it. But if I were to make it for other people I would definitely strain out the broth considering not everyone likes the broth

Wait... they don't like the water... its soup
Why is it so dry?? Where's the broth?
She said “ I’d prefer my ramen to be a little bit dry “ sis I thought you were lying until I saw your ramen you weren’t kidding 😂😂😂

She jealous
“Necessary” ???
The girl with the cheetah print gurl pULEASEEE😂🖕🏾
I hate it when people are so arrogant that they refuse to like anyone else’s food but their own. When someone can’t admit that someone else’s food is better than their own. Edit: Omg thank you so much.
Y'all I'm just mad that the ramen doesn't have broth and that they're eating with a spoon 😫😭  Edit : Atleast the girl at the end had some broth 😔
Notice how the irritating and “confident” people always can’t cook 🥴👀
NGL tho, shrimp ain't broke people food.

Lol why do they like dry ramen 😂😂😂i didn't know people liked it that dry
Where's the soup??
I would put some more attotagoon
They all knew Cheyennes was better then all of theirs😭 and That Olu tryna talk about everybody else food and her shit not even cooked😭😭😭
“This ramen is salty” “Season your ramen!”
Wait...What friggen ramen have you had...its suppose to have some water. Thats called broth. You loose so much if you drain it.
It’s always the rude ones with the worst food 💀
Is it me or are they all dry 😟😟😟😟
I knew the African noodles wasn’t going to be right I’m sorry I tried African food one time and the seasons were off
I feel like the person who always over hypes themselves in these kinds of videos always gets ranked last lmao
A spoon?!

IT'S RAMEN HAHAHA
Lol they wasn't feeling them CHUNKS😂
Olu is so full of herself
Didn't know ppl still said AF irl 💀
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon?
The boy and cheetah gurl definitely don’t know ramen if they don’t know that it has a BROTH
So nobody gon talk about how she said rahmen and not rawmen
lol he said “not enough shrimp in here “ boy it’s broke college ramen bye
When the cheetah girl said  2:00 that its salty then at 2:25  she said:" SEASON THE RAMEN!"
lesson of the day karma is a bitch <3
Straight up none of these looked good, like at all. You can do so much with ramen, even for cheap, and they provide this...like yikes.
“It’s salty, like, are you trying to kill me ?” you can’t handle salt and you’re giving people ‘TIPS’ 💀💀 then she’s calling it flavorless while complaining about the salt, I’m smh so hard rn. This girl is so annoying.   Edit: she was also so goddamn pressed about the seasoning in the ramen when she JUST got done complaining about the salt amounts, this girl istfg-🚶‍♀️
The Cheetah print girl was like my Ramen is the best and got the lowest rating 2 💀
how does ramen give you such an adverse reaction in the thumbnail
The weird name girl annoying asf 😂
THE WAY THE WAS LAUGHING AT THE CHEETAH GIRLS FOOD LMAOOOO

I never knew people eat ramen without the broth. I've never seen it made or eaten dry. Learn something new everyday
Anyone else notice how they eating ramen with a spoon.
Shiiiiiiiit, I dont like any of these people.
“I like my ramen a little dry” OH HUNNY WE KNOW
who eats ramen with spoons-
Cheetah girl is just overreacting
I’m sorry just by looks I’ll be eating Cheyenne’s cause imma need the broth😭
Girl with the Afro was annoying af
Wow someone from Bpt 😩
There’s also as gotta be one pretentious person in taste tests like this lol
Everytime someone judges bad they get bad judged

The cheetah girl so fake boujie like honey humble yourself please
Am I the only one who eats Ramen with soup like a full bowl of soup?? That's ramen
Why did yall give them spoons?
“The ramen is a bit watery” GURL you know original ramen is eaten AS A LITERAL SOUP right?????
“Broke College Kids” Shrimp Chicken & Crawfish? Idk I mean when I was broke in college I bought a dozen eggs for 1$ and I would put a fried egg on top with a little bit of pepper & hot sauce. Doesn’t seem like the broke life to me. 🤣🤣
This video is straight up offensive acting like they know their shit💀✌
Am I the only one confused with them eating ramen with a “spoon” ?
First of all, I have to comment on the fact that all of their ramen looked like a failed experiment gone wrong. Second of all how do none of them know how to make a decent bowl of ramen, literally the seasoning packet has enough msg to make it taste better than whatever I just witnessed all of them eat. Last, final and definitely most disappointing point, why the hell did some of them act like ramen isn't supposed to have broth. The cheetah print girl complained about the ramen being dry... you ain't got no fucking broth that's why. I'm not in college, probably won't go either, but I just can't get over the fact that at 15 I can most definitely make a better bowl of ramen with 3 fucking ingredients.
Where the damn juice
Moral : don't be too confident 🙄
Me who does the tiktok ramen hacks: was i doin it wrong🧍🏽‍♀️
The package never says to drain the water. I have no idea who even started that.
Ramen. With a spoon????????
The girl with the afro thinking she graduated from culinary school
There’s not enough shrimp it’s ramen 🍜
These college broke peps over here judging each other ramens....I know it’s a struggle if they eating ramen with a damn spoon😂...Where the damn chop sticks or fork.?
The guy lowkey reminds me of sid the science kid 😭
“There’s water in the bowl” ......broth? Ya know....what you cook it in? Also both of them complaining so much about it being slimy when hers looked the most normal-
That ramen look like a old lady cat I would throw that in garbage
Ramen is soup why wouldn’t there be liquid???
The one thing that kills me is that they're eating ramen with a spoon.
the one talking the most shit had the worst ramen, crazy right?
Ramen is suppose to have water...or am I just getting taught wrong from my Mexican mother?
the energy in this video stink
Why they eating ramen w a spoon tho???
👀 broke people don’t cook shrimp
Bro I just make my ramen in the packs it comes in and hot sauce and lime, its not supposed to be anything special, it’s broke college ramen not Gordon Ramsey ramen
yall they dont know what ramen is lmao
them acting like ramen ain't supposed to have broth it's a noodle SOUP help
I don't even think she boiled the fucking ramen (cheetah girl)😂
olu was just a toxic bitch whos trying so hard to win
Why r they eating with a spoon

Me en Carlos watch now don’t worry
What the hell is this??😡. So all the"Broke damn College Kids" are BLACK...even the thumbnail too..doesn't matter it's Coco Butter..unsubscribing👎🏾😡
WHO DOESNT LIKE THE WATER IN THE RAMEN??ALL THE FLAVOR IS IN THE BROTH
Then there’s me that just eats it dry
Why did you give them a spoon like they were going to drink some broth? Give them a fork next time
Nobody:    “That sh*t look dry as hell”    😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh I don’t even count that as Ramen where is the soup bruh ?
None of them know how to make ramen lmao... seeing water in a ramen is crazy?  I wonder what would happen if they went to a ramen shop... and saw a broth!?
I always laugh when the 1 who talks the most shit gets the lowest score
Why they complaining about the broth that’s literally the most flavorful part about ramen
why is the tittle broke college kids and they are all black 🤔🤔🤔
That Olu lady give me single miserable girl vibes. 🤣 ugh.
*why.we’re.they.eating.ramen...*    *WITH A SPOON?!?!*
Literally the ones with the worst ramen (that in reality were just seasoned noddles) were the ones talking bad about the good one, when it’s obvious that Cheyenne’s ramen was better, like just by looking at it I would definitely prefer hers cause the other ones were just noddles, I know you are broke but I guess u at least have water 😭😭
THE CAPTION😭😭😭
Top ramen is bomb asf the struggle
They just pick random people off the street for this huh? Cause why did both complain about there being water(broth) in *Ramen noodles*

Wtf did the first guy call the noodles homeboy said maroochun
The boy annoyed me
I hate olu she annoying af
I can’t trust these people cus they don’t even know ramen is a soup and soup is supposed to have “water “ (aka broth ) 😓
Every time I see one of these videos it’s always the same... the one who hypes their food up the most gets the lowest score
Cheyenn ramen tatse good Olu: -_-
“It’s not cutting it for me just to be honest” lol
The ramen matters 😂
I put ranch and seasoning on mine
Cheyenne is the only one who came threw, the other two will eat ramen dry out the bag
Y da fawk dey usan a spoon
from the looks of it all they ramen look nasty-
It's always the one that so confident about they're food n think they're food is the best are the ones who get the worst rates
Cheetah girl hyped herself too much
YALL ITS JUST RAMEN RELAX
HAh she didn't have much ego, didn't really put down others' ramen too much, was super nice, and won!
This whole video is a trainwreck sorry
ur supposed to put water in your noodles wth
When I’m broke I don’t put extra seasoning😭😭😭 I use what’s in the packet
It's always the ones with too much to say that have the worst food.
The rasict cause your basically saying black people are broke so I am unfollowing u
BRO ITS SOUPP CHEETAH GIRL DRAGGING IT
This whole video is screaming ignorance and hypertension.   Girl added all types of shit to a struggle meal and still failed the ramen class. GURL
Ramen is NOT supposed to be dry. It CAN be dry if it's stir fried, but it doesn't have to be dry.
Ramens watery, it looks flooded, it's blah blah. It's fcking ramen, it's ramen broth you muppets.
Only my Hispanic ppl know this all you need is lime , hot sauce and chicken seasoning
I had no clue people ate ramen totally dry without broth
2:45 "but this is a bit dry" she says as her ramen legit has no water in it and is dry as hell.
The guy reminds me of Lionel from Dear White People
Cheyenne voice changed so quick it was weird🤨
I swear the cheetah girl was so confident but then she got a 2 😃 I wonder why
cheetah girl has to be trolling
anyone else feel like this ramen is missing... broth...
He said this look dry 🤣🤣
For the people cooking the Nigerian girl, Nigerians are super critical chile 😭 and ofc the Americans aren’t gonna be into Nigerian seasoning because they aren’t as used to it...still doesn’t excuse her shit being that dry though 💀🤚🏿

5:22 not bad! kinda like mine.
My ramen consists of: Ramen And Crystle/Franks Red Hot.

Basically, college is prison. Lol
No water in any of these? This isn't Ramen, its dry ass pasta lol Y'all eat Ramen like this fr?
Ummmm so olu can you tell me why you think you can judge off seasoning and water when you have the dryest pecie of ramen I've seen, how do you have the courage to say it needs to be more colour full, I get I shouldn't get worked up but come one if you say the drip saved the day what saved yours, I'm sorry I was just so astounded but you tryed so here's a 2
Wait do they even know what ramen is? Like, IT NEEDS TO BE WET. If you want cheap noddles do you do but that's not ramen. Also, this was painful to watch, they sound like spoiled kids who does not want to eat what they have in front of them.
They all don’t look good
The girl with 7 vowels in her name ramen look like her gas got turned off halfway making her noodles.
damn, these people have no idea how to cook ramen.
I can tell y’all never experienced struggle
Y’all realize ramen comes with BROTHHHHH not water it’s BROTH! It’s not nasty 😭
Huge hint that ramen is supposed to have stock or broth...they gave you spoons to eat it with. Granted I don't know why they didn't get a fork...you need that for the noodles...but.......
q frescura pra comer miojo vei
Im having an aneurysm just looking at all these ramens😭
Olu is just like  “this is nasty”  others eating her food “this dry”
two were dry as hell and one is watery as hell when y’all make instant noodles try it with soy sauce and 2 pinch’s of salt it’s amazing
YOU ARE EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON!!!!
Cheetah girl:”I ain’t trying to be mean or anything”  Her 2 seconds later: ”I don’t like it at all like are you trying to kill me?”
Ramen is supposed to be in broth lol what
Olu is so fucking annoying
No one asked but here’s my ramen recipe and it’s a banger  In the bowl you’re gonna have it in 1 tsp sugar 2 tsp light soy sauce 1 tsp fish sauce 0.5 tsp of vinegar or rice vinegar if you have it 2.5 tsp of water and mix it all together  Put in your ramen after boiling and draining it and mix it all together  Top with chilli oil sliced green onion an egg if you want or literally anything that can work as a ramen topping will taste good  One of the best instant ramen recipes I’ve tried and you barely have to clean any dishes after, only the boiling pot strainer and eating stuff
Ramen is supposed to have liquid 🤦‍♀️ it isn’t supposed to be dry
Shakesauce atatagoon
i wouldve been out so fast lmao i leave all the soup lmao
You guys are weird. 😭😭 why do you eat your ramen dry?
Did people legit not have water in the ramen?
They are talking about ramen as if ita not soup 😭😂😂
Cheetah girl with that dry wall of ramen needs to stooppp
As a person who is black and asian uhmmm ramen is a SOUP wym by its to watery whattttt
People eat ramen with no soup base ??? I’m confused 🍜
who eats ramen dry? 💀😃
what the hell type of ramen yall makin 😭 a dozen eggs cost $4-8 and green onions are cheap asl and SPAM, that jawn will last you 4 days, plus if you were really lazy you could've just put soya sauce, sugar, butter and some sesame seeds or chili oil.... this is that slapdash 2-second ion-know-how-to-cook ramen  😭😭😭 take this as a tip from an Asian who grew up with super frugal and cheap parents, some flavoured ramen, a carton of eggs, and green onions is MORE than enough for a week and it costs like $30... this was painful to watch... TREAT YOUR TASTE BUDS AND STOMACH RIGHT 🗣🗣🗣
Mayowa now you know that's not indomie 😂😂😂 def embarrassed Nigerians 😂
LMAO WHEN THE NIGERIAN GIRL SAID IT WAS GOOD THE DUDE SAID “this shit look dry as hell”
Y’all funny I understand everyone had preferences but ramen is a soup lol
Okay, so as someone that grew up in the hood this is ALLL wrong. I just feel like ALL of them Just started making noodles when they got to school but never made them growing up cus all they “ramen” look weak 🤢
uncultured
“There’s no seasoning it has no color” it’s in the broth that the ramen is in  the correct way to prepare it 🤣 🍜
it’s always the people with a better attitude who win

They pressed that the noodles have water? 💀 ITS SOUPPPP
*Oluwamayaowa*
I watched this video. - peter
He gave her the W 😂😂😂

The guy was doing too much😭💀
CHEETAH GIRL BETTER NOT DISRESPECT NIGERIA LIKE THATTTT

Am I the only one that like my ramen with the water 💀
“Too watery” yea well one of the main parts of the ramen is the broth 🍜 I think I see ramen there. Jesus Christ
why do they look so rich tho?
The girl in the cheetah prints ramen looked awful
Can we talk about how they have spoons to eat there ramen
Eats noodles with spoon O_O Guess they too broke to have a fork xD "I use Maruchan noodles" and says "what is this soup?" Maruchan noodles literally say RAMEN NOODLE SOUP in big letters on the packet
Why are they complaining about it being watery but it’s considered a soup, it’s suppose to have juices.
Ramen is soup; it’s supposed to have water!!!
they dont know ramen supposed to have broth???
I dunno if I'm doing it wrong or they're, but I always put hot water in my ramen. Ramen is a soup right?
There is absolutely NO reason for a college student to even have to worry about food PERIODT. If you think you're too good to live in a college dorm and get on a meal plan, then you don't even deserve to go to college... remember it's a privilege,  not a God given right 🤨
Ok but wait 🤚🏽 are they eating noodles with a SPOON
Ok but wait 🤚🏽 are they eating noodles with a SPOON
I was waiting to see the cheetah girl's reaction to her score
They all sucked.
Why are they eating ramen with spoons 😭
if you're eating the ramen raw, like straight out the bag then its understandable that its dry..  but if you're cooking it and not adding water to it, thats just... both of them should be jailed for that lol and of course the girl who added water won.
Can’t they cook it in water wtf
CHEETAH GURLLLLLL, YOUR LEGO RAMEN NOODLES WERE DRYER THAN MY ASHY KNEES AND ELBOWS😭
Okay so chicken flavor half soup half noodle hot sauce and ranch thats all🍜🌶

"a bowl of breadcrumbs" 😂😂😂😂😂
The chunk looks like a part you break off from the fresh opened ramen😂😂
Why don't they know that ramen should have broth???  Also, I could tell from the time she opened her mouth that the Olu child's would be rated the absolute worst.
Did the cheetah girl make ramen or cereal?🤨like tf is that
The cheetah girl is the girl who gives other people low scores just so they can rank higher, then tries to justify why they gave them that low score even tho she knows damn well she lying💀💀💀💀
whyyyy are y'all eating dry ramen?!?!? i am in shock...in tears almost
It's always the cocky one throwin the most shade but food trash lol
alternative title: two people try actual ramen
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHERE THEY WENT WRONG? THEY WENT WRONG BY WAKING UP AND DECIDING TO MAKE IT" YO IM DED
Why are they eating with a spoon lol also, don’t  most ramen have broth? 😂 unless you’re eating a stir fried ramen..
Ramen is supposed to have water ...
Lol there's supposed to be broth in ramen
ok but why are they using spoons like
When the food doesn't have soup and they have the audacity to call it ramen. THOSE ARE NOODLES. RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOUP! IM SORRY FOR SHOUTING BUT THOSE FOODS EXCEPT THE GIRL WHO WON'S ARE AN INSULT TO SOCIETY
She said it’s salty then said it’s unseasoned
cheetah acrs like adding color is for overall when its just presentation...
dying at the fact that everyone in the comments is referring to her as “the cheetah girl” 😭  & why they put so much stuff in they ramen? I was BROKE in college so I may have just put pepper & called it a day. I don’t need all them chunks in my ramen
I feel like they should have never drained the noodles BECAUSE you need the water to consume more flavor wtf
it's always the ones talking majjjooor shit that had the bad food
Homegirl in the leopard print needs to say less....just no. Be humble.
My pet ramen peeves: eating ramen with a spoon and having the ramen too dry
All their ramen looked terrible to me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
man I feel even more broke because I don’t do any of that fancy shut with my ramen. If it the chicken packet...medium to low water and hot sauce. If it the blue packet medium to low water, eggs and hot sauce oooo and green onions a little bit
Why they eating ramen with a spoon
Extra broth in the ramen is the way to go
It’s always the ones talking the most that come out the worst
Cheetah print girl really thought she did sum LMAOOOOO!!!!!
Where's the soup??
I'm happy Cheyenne won and I knew she would too. Cheetah girl 🤦🏽....Bye😒✋🏾
i am glad she woonn lol who tf eats ramen dry??
dry ramen doesn't cut it for me lmaoooo
I drain almost all the water out of my noodles.
the last one looks the best
🤣🤣🤣🤣you have to cook your noodles until it has the consistency of pasta, not clumpy noodles
the people who talk the most shit cant cook at all just want everyone's food to taste how they like it a true chef has respect for different styles of food no matter what they personally prefer
Am I the only one who noticed that one person said 6.5 but they put 9.5?
I like the mama korean chili lime shrimp noodles. Add a splash of maggie seafood seasoning to the water (looks and kinda tastes like soy sauce and  no it doesnt taste fishy or sour like fish sauce). Best thing ever. Top ramen looks sad now. Ive never been back lol
God bless everyone and amen  Stay blessed
I love how marcus just asks"who made this"Lol
Her curls 😻
Nah nah nah I MAKE THE BEST NOODLES LETS REMAKE THIS ATLANTA EDITION! Hmu
cut some onion season with red pepper flakes. after they get good and done throw in a little water to boil noodles when water is gone top with cheese. pretty simple and cheap.
Ugh the girl with the curly hair talks abt the guys rawmen being dry like girl yo hair is Dryer
Who likes ramen dry 😭that’s nasty
their ramen is so weird
“They were wrong for cooking PERIOD”
the fuck do they mean too watery? ramen is supposed to have broth, those are just noodles
These folks hair is on point
This is literally Top 3 of Worst Ramen you could possibly make
My asian ass cannot with the "iT's tO wAteRy.." wdym with that??? Ramen's supposed to have broth 😭 If u don't want broth check out stir fry noodles. I can literally feel the disappointment of my ancestors.
The Nigerian girl is so annoying
I bet you none of them has ever seen ACTUAL RAMEN. also i feel second hand embarrasment for the cheeta girl 😂 like she was so confident and her ramen was the worst.
the fact i was about to make ramen before i came across this video is just wierd asf
They should bring like an actual Japanese college student to show them what ramen should be 😂😂
Are they eating noodles with a spoon?
I think we can all agree raumen is just nasty af
*so the noodles are salty but they dont have seasoning*
weird ramens
those noodles look raw
How'd those two say there was they didn't like water but it's supposed to be soup and all of the bowls lacked the soup?
I love Cheyenne ^^
all they ramen look nasty asf😭😭
Do black people not put water or broth in their Ramen, is that a thing? Cheyenne was the realest so im glad hers won.
This woman said shout out to the shrimp!? Haterrrr, more!
Me starting the video: men for some reason make really good ramen
oh so y'all eat ramen with a SPOON?!?! wtf
Ramen not supposed to be dry wtf is this😂
this video felt like watching someone cook pasta and say "I like mine with a little crunch" and then only season with salt and pepper and no butter or oil. Then someone adds a little butter to theirs and they say it's too greasy...
i am sorry naruto background they dot see real watery ramen
Why do all of their Ramen look dry af? Its not Ramen without a little bit of soupiness
I add a boiled egg to my ramen 😭
You’re supposed to keep the water in it 😐
Cheetah girl: its salty  Me: ITS RAMEN A few moments later... Cheetah girl: Its needs seasoning  Me: I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO SALTY MAKE UP UR MIND!
yall lost me at using spoons 😟
cheeta gurl threw sum dry wall in there she jus aint wanna say it yall
the girl with the fro had so mush sarcasm but......-
The watery ramen is how ramen should be. The cheetah girl might have the Nigerian spice which i think take your taste buds to cloud 9 when used properly, but she really doesn't know how to cook ramen. While, having lots of chicken in ramen beats the idea of having ramen... Cos you gotta actually enjoy the watery feeling of the noodles without being bugged with obstructions. Hence, Cheyenne with the shrimps definitely the one i would go for.
What are they studying in college? How can you complain about the soup when eating Ramen?
What a waste of confidence lmao, she just has different preferences I guess.
Don't trust people who like their ramen dry
That’s not ramen
"the water" tf its broth...
that spice bitch kept getting on my nerves everytime she spoke like fukkkk
Ramen is better with soup
da fuck
Ok try the jail hookup ramen. Noodles mayo cheese spread tuna or any fish little mustard little relish seasoning
I feel like im the only one who eats ramen as a soup💀
Shorty with braids is so pretty
This cheetah girl needa shut up🤦🏾‍♂️
Watching this video was so fucking strange because, on one hand, you have this over-conceited girl who prefers her ramen completely dry af with nothing but the seasoning and is strangely complaining about the sodium (which ramen noodle has a lot of), and then there's the dude who is turned off by the watery consistency of the ramen as if he never tasted ramen noodle soup in his entire life. The only person who I could stand was Cheyenne, and I am glad she won.
I mean, ramen taste good on its own tho...
SPOONS ???
The way cheetah girl says ramen boils my blood 🙄   Omg and ASSESSORY miss girl please
Cheetah girl think she's the shit when she just shit
“ Its everything for mee “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i didn't know eating dry af ramen was a thing.   really. um...e
I just mash the ramen in the bag, put some spices in, shake it, and done! I like it better dry lol.
That’s African girl pissed me off 😡
Shawty got a 2 oh nah 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
My one complaint...wth is y’all eating NOODLES with a spoon??🤨
THEY NEED A FOUTH PERSON TO BREAK THEM NOT WANTING TO GIVE THE OTHER PERSON A HIGHER SCORE
Just wait until these people find out there are more than maruchan ramen, MAMA ramen is so good
Can we get a video of cheetah girl reacting?? 😂
so we all gone ignore 1:48 “my mom is spanish this giving me spanish vibes”💀Spanish is a language 🧍🏽‍♀️
But ramen is a noodle soup tho???????? **confused asian screams**

Oakfbskosmdenb dont even know how to SEASON THE RAMEN HERSELF LIKE GIRL WHAT I dont understand ms gurl nb liked yours sweetie
I love how all of theirs look gross and they say theirs is better🙄
Where the hell is the broth?!😭😭😭
0:34 why this dude look gray
the cheetah girls vibe was very ugly and disgusting 😂
Why are they eating the shit uncooked & they fucked up not leaving a lil soup in the bottom
The woman in the cheetah print has fish girl vibes haha
I feel like I want to put my three chili ramen in there. Get some blackened shrimp, fish sauce, soy sauce, onion, garlic, dark chili powder, chili oil, and gochujang paste in there. Got some decent heat with flavor to back it up. For my fellow broke bros out there, give it a try
Cheetah girl gives "black-owned businesses only" vibes
Y'ALL KNOW RAMEN IS SOUP, RIGHT?
Where the fuck the broth
I thought college students would know more then me about ramen, BOY THAT AINT WATER IT'S CALLED BROTH, OMG!!
No broke white college kids Ok
The 3rd one is proper ramen, the rest is either yakisoba or literally eating it out of the bag.
The cheeta girl is saying the most yet is that a while of rubber?
Ramen has soup. This is a cheap version of a noodle and soup dish. How do people not understand this, and act like soup has no place in ramen. Also, cheetah girl's ramen looked so disgusting. Idk how she served that with a straight face
honestly they all shady towards each other foods but love there own . They won't give each other they opinion because they only eat theirs
It’s always the confident ones
Should have just put peanut butter and hot sauce on it. Cheap, weird and delicious lol
I'm sorry, but all of these ramen are absolutely TRAGIC I would not put a single one in my mouth I dont understand why none of them understand the principles of a broth?!!
the fact they were eating with spoons and no broth had me ded
Marcus looks like Dbangz
BROKE college students
Every single person that talks the most smack bombs. lol
Uh... all look baf
Zero fried or soft boiled egg.. furikake.. scallions..when said she likes it dry?! Ramen  is egg noodles and broth fam. I'm 😢 haha
I love the winner she is actually amazing & sweet 🥰🥰❤
Why did they give them spoons?
Olu: I would prefer my Raman a little more dry    Everybody: oh honey we know.
am i like the ONLY person who thinks the ramen looks so dry?
Omg don't you hate students like Cheetah girl during group assessments at school? 😂
“Ranman”😭
Lmaooo ion do all that . If it’s the chicken flavored it’s getting that packet , cheese and hot sauce and call it a day 😂
At the end they said there’s to much water what do you expect Japanese ramen has water 😂
Cheetah girl is like flexing her ramen recipe and then said she's gonna  win definitely but her was the lowest score I be like : high expectations 😂🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
I put sazón Goya on my noodles. I put y’all on 😳.
College students don't use water in ramen? Are they so smart they fucked up ramen.
Mine would literally shit on all of there’s I’ve mastered the art since childhood bc it’s all we could afford😌
Ms. Neuroscience couldn’t find anything nice to say 🤣
Cheyenne is my baby sisters name!
I mean the reason why the last girls was so good was because she actually cooked hers and made it the correct way
Ngl not trying to be rude but cheyenne's ramen looks the most edible  and they complaining how there is water like that how ur suposed to make it        im literally about to throw some hands like hatin' but ya'll not even that good looking
I just eat the brick
African girl doing too much for me...dry behind Ramen..
How are they broke but they can afford college
The black girl IS SLAYING THE BLM COMMUNITY🔥
My friend: Why is there only black ppl here???? Like um- theres broke white students too-  Me: I dont think you get it ;-;
Olu is annoying asf. Shes gorgeous but her personality is ughhhh.
Why is no one talking about how Marcus said Maruchan  😐
lmaoooo she talking abt the color when hers was the worst ☠️
that cheetah girl got on my nerves fr
Why they using spoons
It's amazing how people think that their tastes are the standard.
That boy should shut his mouth FoR a MiNiTuE
Black excellence!!!
and there all black ...
Yoooo. The girl that talked down on his got the lowest score 😭
shoutout to the shrimps that saved the day 😀
the 2nd girl's ramen looks so dry. it could be used for those ramen sink repair videos
Ramen was soup tho initially yall just making stir-fry 🤣
Olu is a hater & hers was the worst! Lol how is your noodles still in chunks after being “cooked?” 🤢🤮
Olu is a hater & hers was the worst! Lol how is your noodles still in chunks after being “cooked?” 🤢🤮
her @2:05  also her @2:24
Just so we're all on the same page😑😤....RAMEN IS A SOUP!!!!!
if you haven’t notice by now the ones that be talking the most shit cooking be the worst😭
They have no idea how to make ramen
Is this a joke?🤣 I was a broke college kid. Frozen veggies cost a dollar, an egg (out of a dozen) cost pennies, and you can use left over meat (if you have it). You have protein, carbs, and veggies. Something a little more sustainable to eat that costs less $5 per serving AND you can have it multiple times a week.  These guys never had real ramen or know how to cook and it shows lol. Props to them surviving off their own food cause once you learn how to make something well (and I won't say right cause there is no right way) you'll question how you were able to eat it before.
I was so distracted by the fact that they were using a spoon
How tf do two of these people see an issue with RAMEN having BROTH? It's not ramen without broth, it's just a bowl of noodles. tf?
Racist channel
Do they not know ramen noodles are traditionally served in a soup💀🍜
...they know ramen is a soup right
"They went wrong by waking up..." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ngl, ms.cheetah piss me off🤺
They all have quirky little attitudes which is about my kids age currently so eh, they sure have no clue how to cook, even a stuggle meal like this... But I will say atleast they cute !! Chyennes look was my fav!!  Let's just be honest, the food all looked blah and bland asf !!
Producers !! When you do videos like this one, could you please !! After they have all tasted eachothers food, show them the recording of the others trying their food.  So they can see what others say and think of their food AND && of course so we can see their reactions.  Pleaseeeee...  *Maybe at the beginning of all of your tasting videos, you could tell them to of course be respectful &&& ask them to always say something nice about the dish, something b/c thats how they would behave if they tasted it in front of that person.   ⬆⬆⬆⬆ THIS IS A VIDEO that I would subscribe to your channel to see !!
My style ramen 🍜 cook it plainly and squirt ketchup on it nix it and enjoy 😉
sleeping was never really an opinion...
I know that shot finna be soggy
Hell nahhhhhhhhhhhhh
I had my own apt at 14 while working and in Highschool, even before college. I def can feel the struggle!
Everybody: I don’t like the texture Me: why you eating ramen with a spoon?
All they had to do was follow the instructions - lol.
Wait, how in the hell do y'all not have "WATER" a.k.a SAUCE in your ramen thoooo?! I understand that some folks wants it dry... BUT that shit is DRY DRYYY.. LOL
someone put me on this show. i claim i have the best damn recipe and would trump anyone that would try to challenge me.
Why are they using spoons?
If I was broke and poor I still wouldn’t eat ramen
It was funny when they said cheetahs was nasty and she was positive she was gon win
"My MUuUuUuUuuuuuuUMmMmMmm IiiiiiiiIiIisSsSsSsSs SpPAaAnnniIiISsSsHhHh"       Uhm.....I think its Mexican-
What kind of monster eats ramen with a spoon.
Oof when she said “ræmen”
Why did that guy look grey with the front facing camera everyone else looked fine lol
Do these people not know that ramen is a soup? It’s not chow me in!
The most critical and shadiest person always loses lol
The boy and that girl Olu noodles were so fucking dry😭😭😭.
RAMEN IS SOUP! It’s not supposed to be dry
my name is cheyenne tooo
A mistake they all made was not putting some  chedder chesse in there or at least some butter
too much confidence was that girls downfall
I put mine with a cup of water for 5 mins let that heat put some adobo,black pepper and that little bad that comes with it. Pour it out and then liquid PERFECT 👌😂
ramen is supposed to have broth.........
Y does she like it dry💀💀
I apologise on behalf of all Nigerians for that disgrace of a ramen
Cheyenne!!   🔥  so cute.
Her : it’s way too salty Also her : where’s the spices where’s the flavor
Perfect broke ramen meal. Half noodles, half soup. Hot sauce, soft boiled egg, and shredded cheese with a little pepper and garlic.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Im so scared to put anything in my ramen. Someone PLEASE give me suggestions
are we not gunna talk about how they speak of ramen as if it is extraordinary cuisine.
Where’s the folks? You can’t eat ramen noodles with a spoon.
Glad my country have the msg ramen lol. Maggi curry and samyang for life
Wow Ramen is salty? Who would’ve thought?!
Who the hell eats ramen with a damn SPOON
they probably weren't used to olu's spices which is why they found it gross but girl its not supposed to be drier than my knees 😭😭
Im here from shake sauce
Olu came with smoke and then got smoked
Thought so same sis I use a lot of water
Wait? When did the standard become DRY and clumpy? and when did we start eating Ramen with a spoon? You slirp that ish up after you done lol
they be like : i like ramen without water
BRUH. she gave it a THREE after eating it and liking it
heres my good ass ramen recipe bc these ppl cant cook...... put some water in a pot and get that shii hot or wtvr thenn put onion and garlic powder (i prefer more onion than garlic but....... its up to u bestie) then put a lil soy sauce along wit the CHICKEN ramen seasoning (dont put too much soy sauce bc the ramen packet is already salty)  (DO NOT use no fuckin ramen that isnt chicken u nasty bitch)(jk)(or not) AND FINALLY put a nice dollop of gochujang for that spiciness and extra flavor (you can get it at ur local asian market purr its like 5 dollars and lasts a while) then add ur ramen once the broth is done  ur welcome besties !! <3333
The afro girls Ramen seems like it’ll probably soak in all the saliva out my mouth 👅😂
Lets talk about like why the noodles dry!
I hate dry ass ramen, all of they ramen looked 🤢sorry i just cannot 😂😂😂 how can you mess up ramen. Tbh they doing too damn much to the ramen that's why it's nasty 💁🏿‍♀️
Isn’t ramen a soup?? Wtf did I just see
I wish I could've been 1 of the 3! YALL NEED SOME BROTH FOR THOSE NOODS!!!
Dear ppl Ramen is a soup plz don't eat it dry thank you to the only person that added water
Why don't they have forks? 😭😭😭
This video is an insult lmao
"It's gray" LMFAO WHAT?!
Cheeta girl's ramen was in clumps, so how did she think that was flavortown?
wait yall eat ramen without the SOUP ? woah
*that guy is hella funny😭😭*
*why was cheetah girl acting like that- i actually can't stand her.*
why are they so negative lmaooo
All these look nasty
The fact y’all got add ins in y’all ramen shows they not broken for real. The add ins need to be stuff you lifted from the caf. butter, chips, Parmesan/chili flake packets you collected from the pizza you ordered when you had money, cheese etc. not chicken and shrimp!! Y’all got money! Lol
Do they not know that ramen has broth and it's not just plain ass noodles..? 😒
sees caption me: so what they gon do bring in different packs of ramen noodles
Real ramen is suppose to have water ....uncultured....
Olimaywa.... did she say she goes to riverside university... since when their was a university riverside has??? It’s only RCC community college. Dh 😂
they judging each other hard for it to be some cheap ramen tho... like y’all expect it to be gourmet and authentic when u got it from convenience store 😭
WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON
2:41 yours has too much flavor and taste
So boom I’m 14 and make ramen nooodles with black pepper lemon pepper hot sauce sugar cayenne pepper
WHO EATS DRY AF RAMEN
The dude was annoying asf, im glad the nice one won
Everyone I know likes thier instant noodles with less broth and it looks like Cheyenne's. As for the other 2, it looks like what I made as a kid and sneakily fed to the dogs because I refused to eat it because it's disgusting. I can't believe they came for her saying it's too watery... Ugh if you ever made a packet of noodles without enough water that shit is so thick and chunky it makes you gag. Just cause you broke doesn't mean you have to eat shit
I wouldn't eat her noodles, but I'd take a bite outa Cheyenne any day. Damn.
They went wrong by cooking period 😝
Why does the color matter lol
Damn how do you make noodles even worse?? Plus the “water” is supposed to be broth
i like my ramen with a little bit of juice... dont get pressed at me. it just doesnt hit different with all of the juice
So whose gonna tell them actual ramen has a ton of water in it
Is that a spoon-
Olu was talking mad shit and got a 2😂😂
They is RUDE
Lol I prefer ramen with a little broth. Those other two ramens, too dry ,blows my mind.
Dang how do y’all not know how to dress up ramen?? Green onions, soft boiled egg— Panko shrimp..?? Sesame oil? Chili oil? Huh?!!!
Why are they eating the ramen with SPOONS
People don’t eat ramen with broth?? Lol I’m confused
This is the first time im hearing that people don't consume their ramen as SOUP. I'm shook
4:30 WE ALL LOVE HER
"This is just dry"   SAYS THE ONE WHOS RAMEN ISNT EVEN COOKED 💀💀
Props to Cheyenne for using water 👏
why are they using spoons, where is the broth
My complaint is, why did they all of a sudden start judging how it looked at the end. The whole idea is that ur broke college students this isn't chopped LMAOO
These kids need to look up prison ramen recipes. All these ramen look like 💩. Last one was the closest thing to looking okay. And her adding the sauces is straight up prison ramen 101.
Who eats dry noodles 🤣🤣
Y’all know u have to eat noodles right after it’s done
homegirl chose hypocrisy😭 all of them looked nasty fr
Serious question how is her mom Spanish and she's that complexion? I sincerely wanna know
I’m actually shocked by the comments. You guys the packet is the soup flavoring. You put boiling water with the soup packet and the noodles, wait a couple minutes and eat the ramen and drink the soup with it. I’m like flabbergasted,, people are saying like you’re supposed to add hot water, dump it out, and then put the seasoning on NOOO!! It isn’t Yakisoba guys, ramen is a soup dish. The packet has the broth flavoring and everything. It isn’t supposed to be crunchy or just soggy noodles 💀
This is literally hurting my Japanese soul Ramen IS A SOUP DISH ! ITS A SOUP MIX YOU MIX THE POWDER WITH WATER TO MAKE SOUP I literally couldn’t finish this video
Olu was actually doing a lil to much for her ramen to be in chunks
None of it caught my attention like that but if I'd have to choose I pick Cheyenne period.
I feel like I'm one of the only of the only people that actually makes a broth with the packet for my ramen lol. No broth is too dry imo.
They rating ramen like it a 5 star dish like damn give the contestants some slack 🤨🤨
why are the eating ramen with a spoon? there's not even soup in there!
bruh when you are broke, you just have ramen, not with any other ingredient but just plain ramen.
3:11 she was talking all that sh*t and this happens 😂 😂 💀
Sorry but why are they using spoons🤣💀
Growing up I never knew people didn’t eat it with the broth it’s like the best part. That moment at the end when you pick up the bowl and get the last sip of soup is so satisfying.
"i don't like all the water, i like my ramen more dry" RAMEN HAS BROTH IN IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"my first instinct is to smell so I'm not eating anything like bad yeah know" BITCH YOURS WASNT EVEN COOKED
How can you possibly mess up Ramen, all of them should stop talking.
The best part about going to culinary school for college (will be in a few years) would be to have access to good food. Separate note. Hate the cheetah girl. Stuck up and mean. The cheetah chick legit say "I prefer my Ramen a bit more dry", like we can't already tell Lady, u didn't cook them.
They really eating ramen with a spoon 😭
"I prefer my ramen a little dry" yeah...only a little...
I feel like none of their food looked good though lol everyone’s a loser
nobody is eating that dry Sahara desert ramen
Um... that Nigerian girl needs to humble herself. I’m not even surprised that she’s Yoruba 😅 Too prideful for me like girl...
Curly hair over here talking sh!t when her ramen dry as fck like who in gods green earth eats dry fcking ramen 🙏bess the other two tho🙏😇
Bruh says why is there water in ramen take a moment to hear what you said
Isn't cheetah girl supposed to be Nigerian, WHAT'S WITH THAT RAMEN.
bruh how tf are they cooking the ramen and there's NO WATER in the bowl. ITS A SOUP
I don’t like water in my ramen either
That nigerian stuff not gonna work with a Black American dish
cheetah girl is SELLING her ramen 💀
*i love how the girl in the cheetah print was saying how everyone else’s was trash but everyone hated hers and she got a 2💀 and I love how they where mean to the girl in the black but she won😂this is hilarious*
Like wait was she tryna do with the hard pieces
The ones who talk the most shit food always be nasty 🤢😂
dude they should taste indomie
Awww me and Cheyenne have the same name😭💕
The girl in the cheetah shirt is talking all that Smack when hers looks like she took it out of the bag and just put crap on it.
Afro girl , you sound pretentious and obnoxious, you sound like the girl who hypes everything up in class or w. friends. Like you make the blue sky. Sound mad extra extra in the most extreme extra way.  Like the attention starved kid, like if me an her was in class I'd of straight wanted to fight of how uppity an I'm better then you type persona
“Is dat hair “ nah I’m up up “shutdown the studio “
who eats dry ramen OMG NOOO you have to have just the right amount its not soup either
It’s always the cockiest people that get the lowest scores..do y’all ever pick up on that😂?
This was funny, but I want to be on there with my ramen. I only saw one with some broth, I like mines dry, but a little broth is key.
LMFAOOOO it’s the girl in the Cheetah print over hyping her slightly cooked ramen for me
why are they acting like having broth in ramen is weird? like bruh
Olu! 🤣 GIRL!🤣 being humble is K E Y cause hunny... 🤦🏾‍♀️
I'd just make ichiraku ramen
What’s up
What’s up
Ramen is soup ... its supposed to have some "water"
cheetah girl was pretty as hell but petty at the same time
“the ramen is a bit watery” girl.... and your ramen was what? dry and didnt look cooked at all 😭
first one i saw where theyre all rude... damn its the poverty and homework 😭
Bro to the cheetah girl, if you want raw ramen just don’t cook it at all it’s pretty good actually but don’t fckg cook it HALFWAY COME ON, girl was tryna diss everyone and say she came with them Nigerian vibes or wtv but it’s just RAMEN for God’s sake, I’m Algerian and I DO NOT try to make food that is not Algerian taste like it is COME  ON
Team Cheyenne!!!!💪
All they noodles dry
How she say its too salty 2:05 then she change up and say it has no flavor 2:24
broke college students dont got shrimp or chicken or whatever all this other stuff is
What y’all mean it was watery?😭 If you got it from any other food place, IT WOULD’VE BEEN COVERED IN BROTH
Every one of them had Ramen that looked terrible lmao
Ramen does need much seasoning either. How did they mess that up?
Cheyenne was the only one that did it right “why’s there water” do y’all not use the ramen base? Y’all j eat the noodles? No that’s not how we do it
😂😂😂
So people dont eat soup in their ramen 😂 they eat it dry?
I’m sorry, they just  ✨e x p o s e d✨ them- Calling them Broke- I-
All of these dishes looks sorry awful i wouldn’t eat any
“It’s too watery” it’s ramen.... u literally eat dry mushy ramen 💀✋🏾
How is shrimp a broke college food?
How tf two people saying ramen not supposed to have broth????  What level of broke is this???
Broke college students with horrible cooking skills 🤦🏾
The other two contestants didn't want to give Cheyenne her props lmao
Title - "broke college student" Video starts - "I graduated"
The only person who actually made RAMEN in this RAMEN challenge is Cheyenne lol. RAMEN IS A SOUP lol as a Ramen connoisseur, honestly all their Ramen ingredients sound gross. It don’t take that much, the flavor belongs in the broth and whatever additions you include. Not the noodle itself
They shit look dry
The cheetah girl needs to be in a asylum 😭
Who the fuck eats ramen with a spoon?
USE A FORK OR CHOPSTICKS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
Woah woah ! Slow down ... ramen is a Damn soup 🍜.... that’s it .., that’s all I had to say
People don't like broth in they're fucking ramen smh
They should try mine. I make the pasta and drain the water. Then I put milk instead of water in my chicken ramen. And then I microwave it. Yeah it sounds "gross" but your taste buds are in heaven if we are similar in preference. I like flavors such as ranch and buffalo wings, fettuccine alfredo, shrimp, anything spicy etc
I wanna see cheeta print reaction of gettin a dam 2 💀💀 girl really thought she was doin somethin w them raw noodles
cheetah girl microwaves water and puts it on raw instant noodles and calls it "5 star quality italian mexican style ramen" LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Add some onions, add some tomatoes, add some bell peppers, add chilli powder, tumeric, salt and black pepper and see the difference..
* buys ramen thats with soup *  problem solved  ALSO WHO EATS RAMEN WITH A   S P O O N
Why they all gotta be black
Why they eating w a spoon, or am I just weird
It’s always the one who talks the most 💩and excessively puts the others down who gets the worst ratings and has the worst food, ALWAYS😭
I- did they even cook it?
Yo Cheetah Girl ramen has me on the floor😂😂😂😂😂
“I would prefer mine a little more dry” miss  ma’am we can see that 🙄
Dude look like that dude from that’s so raven. What’s his name? Orlando brown or somethin like that
30 cent slim Jim’s and Chicken lime
The last one looks how Roman is supposed to look.It's soup people it's supposed to have a little broth... Honestly don't know why they gave them spoons for the first two.. plus her noodles were actually cooked.
You're supposed to eat ramen with broth. These people know what they're talking about.
What I have noticed All contestants love their own Ramens and is like really judgy when it comes to others
What has the world come to... I’m watching people JUDGE ramen....
I think cheetah girlie thought she was on a cooking show where she’ll win 10,000 dollars😍😙😝
No broth is confusing to me
Do people actually drain their noodles like it’s literally soup I never drain mine that’s so 🤮
no broth with the ramen... its all DRRRYYY
they was talking abt how they like sum dry ramen😭 bro what?
everyone  is calling her cheetah girl cause they can not spell her name
y’all ramen is soup it’s supposed to be watery...y’all like your dry cause y’all are nasty. but-
Why did they both complain about the actual broth being in the ramen for the last one? Like does nobody make their ramen like the package says to?
so is ramen not supposed to have water lmao
Nigga yall dont eat ramen wit water??
Bruh. Y’all don’t have water in your ramen?😭😭
Have they ever had actual Ramen? Lmao.
I’m sorry for saying this, I feel bad, but Olu sometimes kinda talks as if she’s writing a narrative. Idk how else to explain this, it makes no sense but idk but she’s not talking talking but sounds like she’s talking from a script from an add😭. Olu I’m sorry if you see this, just an observation, you’re very pretty.
Cheetah is irritating for real her ramen looked like she did
But you said that it was salty
3:17
Hold on, how did they find these students? Like.. the convo like this or smth? Cocoa: Ay yo you broke af? Student: Yea, why? Cocoa: COME JOIN ON BROKE COLLEGE KIDS-  how they do that tho?
6.5 not 9.5
Cheetah girl is pissing me off she’s so rude ... she needs to humble herself
thats why her name is oluoluol
Ramen is supposed to have broth in it wtf are they talking about. They need Asian friends
Why the first two ramin dry though, like, they don't make it into a actual soup??
why thay use spoons
DA that bitch mean
This shit look dry as hell lmaooooo
Tip. Add garlic, mayo and egg mixed together to your ramen immediately after cooking.
She couldnt say nothing else so she had to talk about the color 😂 thats why it deserved a 2?????
Crayfish isn’t a spice.
Dry ramen? 😂 ramen is a soup yall... it’s supposed to be “watery”
People not understanding that ramen is noodle SOUP
That's not even how nigerians make their ramen! Ours is nice and juicy with NO chunks! We also put vegetables in our ramen! She is falsely representing us!
The raccoon season is clearly not it
Do these people really not know that ramen is supposed to be watery 💀
As a Nigerian  That’s not Nigerian style ramen
Cheetah girl said its to salty but also said to add more salt to the noodles
They are talkin too much while they are broke
Why are they eating noodles with a spoon? 🤔
So can’t none of them make ramen 😂 got it.
She said I’ll like my ramen a little more dry but-she just ugh I can even explain
These people dont even know ramen last one came the closest cat print lady is just stuck up dummy
Like all the  Rounds that boy is saying must up stuff
he doesn’t get the water? Does he not know what soup is?
None of them are broke fr, I can show u struggle noodles 😭 & its raymond not rumon 😂😂
I’m trying to figure how cheetah girl and musical boy got into school water???? Bruh its broth 😭
uhhhh
“Like are you tryna kill meee”      *yes that seems about right yes* and she saying ramen matters girl BYE.
Bruhhhh do people really not drink the water? I fill my bowl with water and drink it after finishing the ramen, ya'll weird💀
cheetah girl aint do nothing all she did was take it out of the paper and put seasoning
wheres the sugar,the cinnamon i dont taste the sweetness!
Should change the title ‘top ramen’ cuz everybody in the comments tweaking about “real ramen  has water”
I came to roast the animal print girl but I see the comment section already doing it 🤣
My POV  Person A: 0/10 Person B: 0/10 Person C: 0/10 My Ramen recipe: 1000000/10 Compared to these people yeah😂😂😂
The real question is why are they eating it with a spoon
IM NEARLY HALF THEIR AGE AND I CAN COOK IT BETTER  Do they not know to leave a little bit of the broth- bruh
Cheetah girl I’m Nigerian nooooo your ramen is dry
Olu is a natural hater lol
Girl if u can afford shrimp then u dont have to eat ramen as a main meal.
“Coming with a different vibe”   Miss girl the only vibe you came with was the desert.
Not them complaining about the water🤣🤣😭😭 that was probably the funniest part
wheres the soup bruv
All these ppl suck
why they broke cant they work part time?
I can’t stand when the noodles soft they gotta be the perfect I’m between. Cooked in high for exactly 2:53
U.B. ✊🏾 🙏🏽💜
That was not Nigerian ramen. Nigerian ramen is very moist and super flavorful. I don’t know what that was.

RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOUPY NOT DRY
Realize all of the broke college students in the video are of color .. smhh
Its salty like are you trynna kill me had me dead
Do they not know what ramen is???
Where’s the soup ?
Ramen is not ramen without the broth, it's just noodles.
yall on the instructions it says ADD WATER. ramen needs water. why didnt nobody cook it like it was said
I love how Marcus was trying to act like chef of the hour bro you got an 8 not to mention those noodles looked dry asf wheres the water
Ramen is a soup. The other two out here trying to make yakisoba out of ramen packets... 🤣😂
*why are they eating it with spoons*
**If you want a good ramen recipe, then find Greg's Kitchen and watch his ramen video.**  Sincerely, Yours Truly
No no no bby girl this is just wrong. All of their ramens have way too many things that are just WRONG. Are we not gonna talk about the fact that you have to add water to your ramen, like... Oru was over here - "I like mine more dry". YEAH, we can tell. It looks like you put your ramen in the microwave with no water, added spices, and called it taste, and flavor. I felt so bad for miss girl over there saying her thing was the texture. Yeah, when you ate Oru's dish, you must have had a sensory overload, oh my god, don't even get me started with Marcus' meal... sweetheart, that's not it... it just isn't... CHICKEN... IN RAMEN? I just... idk I'm disappointed. The one girl with the crop top actually had broth, which is the thing that has the flavor, so she done did good on that one PERIODT.  Oru said "It's slimy", like... no it ain't you just like your ramen dryer than air, so you wouldn't understand. Oru could've been humble, because we all know you are NOT the next Gordon Ramsay, and you never will be by continuing making that ramen. As I said, bby girl, YOU ARE JUST INCORRECT. PERIODT.
when she said “it got water in it” i was like  *ma’am that’s soup-*
Damn and bitch was trynna flex 😭
“I preFer my RamEn a LittlE dRy”  yeah girl we can tell😀🖐🏻
I will always say this. The one who talks the most smack is the worst one there. Ughhh. It irritates me so much that they talk all this smack and their food is so nasty. I knew Olu's was nasty as hell looking at it
Where’s the broth!?
Not broke kids lol I love ramen but like real ramen tho
miss cheetah girl over here thinking she's everything but with her ramen not even cooked its chucks litterally thats how you know it isnt cooked.
ramen flooded?? its a soup??
Ramen is supposed to have water????? Like why are they mad there is water in Cheyenne's, its SOUP!!!!!
I think we can all agree that no one cares about cheetah girls “ Nigerian spices “. Is “otangagoon” the only spice she knows!?
"I like my Ramen a bit dryer..." biiitch we know 😅 like the Sahara
Olu miss shhhhhhh😭😭😭😭
I would eat Cheyenne ramen cause I put shrimp in mine to and have juice as well people who can eat they ramen not soupy cudos 😭😭
the only challenge I wholeheartedly know i would've won! put in there next time!
It's *ALWAYS* the ones who got the *MOST* to say about others...😂🤦🏻‍♀️
THE RAMEN MATTERS 🍜
"I prefer my ramen a little dry" Oh sis we know
OMG RAMEN IS SOUP PPL I-
cheetah girl: mine is such the best and im of course going to win   *gets the lowest rating and even a 0*
I hate when they are mean to other’s dishes so that they can win lol
Neither of them are any good at cooking. Use the "broth" to elevate the Ramen. This isn't rocket science. All you need is something like bean sprouts or lettuce to add some texture and a bit of flavor. Could just use Sriracha. Add some chicken and you are done. These kids should drop out if they are too stupid to make ramen
I’m sorry but the picked bad contestants for this video! I have seen people SLAY the heck out of some 95cent ramen!
pov: your here cuz of shakesauce
why is water not an ingredient in any of these noodle dishes? lol
Why did they give them spoons to eat with lol
“I prefer my ramen a little bit dry-“ GIRL WE KNOW YOURS WAS A BLOCK
Y they acting like having soup in the ramen is nasty 😭😭😭
they are all black
BRO THIS CHEETAH GIRL IS SO ANNOYING
RAMEN is supposed to have liquid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The fact that y’all don’t know the difference between leopard print and cheetah print rlly infuriates me ✨
‘my mom’s spanish’ shawty said her mom’s a language
It’s always the cocky people that suck LMFAO
Iam broke and indomie mie goreng is my besties :))
Ok UCR! 👏🏽
Why they it with spoon
“I like my ramen a little more dry” GIRL WE KNOW!! 💀😭
They showed no type of sympathy in the title😭😭😭
Can someone tell me why their eating ramen with a spoon??
why are they eating it with a spoon?
The cheetah girl really thought she did something huh🤣🤣
I feel as if everyone was being maliciously judgmental instead of doing what they came there to do. Judge the taste of the food. Ramen is wet that is what ramen is and it’s placed in a seasoned water base..... the younger generation is deff something else ...
When Im broke....I buy the shell macaroni,  cheapest feta (White greek cheese) , paprika powder and some crème fraiche = which is like 4euro.And you could make food for 2 days. Simplex, tasty and cheap.
He look like syd from skins uk I’m in loveee
It has water in it....BITCHHH THIS IS RAMEN NOT PASTA...the Asian counties need to keep they shit away from Americans 💯
ramen commonly has soup with it.. its not “water” why they freaking out
it's always the one who talks a lot about other dishes and are the ones who lose
Olu said it was too salty but then said it didn’t taste like anything! She tried to sabotage purposely 😂 and still lost
It’s always the ones who talk the most shit their food is gross
cheetah girl is SO ANNOYING
I prefer my ramen a little more dry...  Yea we can tell
olu... girl-
I love the way they all say the last one is watery.. when ramen is noodles in broth.. lol
Okay so. These people aren’t broke college students no more. They’ve clearly forgotten the struggle because these criticisms and even how they’re preparing the ramen is not how an actual broke college student would do it.   2:24. Go back to college. You just complained about it being too salty, and then you told them to season their ramen.   Also. Ramen is inherently salty if you use the packet. Wtf are you on?  6:25. Bro. Color? It’s fucking ramen. Y’all not chefs. I thought y’all were making it how actual broke college students would make it.  And, I know y’all privileged af to be eating it with a spoon.
Deez bout the boujiest broke people I’ve ever seen “ramen got too much water in it” bredda what??
bruh this cheetah print girl- “it has no color i would give it a reddish color” UR A BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT WHY ARE U WORRYING ABT COLORFUL FOOD
The cheetah print girls Ramen looks like you can use it to build a house on minecraft
“I like my ramen a bit dry”  We know......
Water??? Y’all mean broth? Like you eat DRY RAMEN 🤢 ALSO THE CHETTA PRINT GIRL NEEDS TO SHUT UP BECAUSE SHE NOT AS GOOD AS SHE THINKS
Real hood Ramen got egg and hot dogs in it. All my OGs know this already
WHERE IS THE BROTH?!?!?? RAMEN IS A SOUP!!
Ramen is supposed to be a soup people
Umm are they straining the ramen after they cook it?! Its a damn soup, it has liquid thats how it’s supposed to be.
The girl in the cheetah outfit is so full of herself gross
damn she did come with a different vibe
“There’s not enough shrimp”, boy you realize this is about BROKE STUDENTS ramen right? 🙃 People complain about the Cheetah print girl but the guy was also kind of a crybaby for tasting a better ramen than his.
This kids can’t cook for shit 😂 where’s the soup, the scallions, the egg, bruh, i live in Switzerland, one of the most expensive countries and i can at least make good ramen
Gurl its all bad, like where is the soup that goes with ramen wheres the BROTH😩
“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry” ohhh we know 💀💀😭😭
Cheetah girl after dat name i new what ot was 🤣🤦🏾
Did she just say rehman
you are broke. you dont have shrimp. where did you get shrimp?! if you have money for shrimp, buy an actual meal!
you are broke. you dont have crayfish.
Hold up....  *ARE THEY EATING THAT WITH A SPOON?*
WHEN SHE PULLED OUT A CLUMPPPP 😂💀💀
Omg are the eating ramen without broth and with spoons?!
cheetah girl talking all that smack but her ramen looks like dumblings lmfaoooo
My noodles always have soup!
Marcus reminds me of a Black Carl from Jimmy Neutron
Ms Nigeria annoyed tf out of me 😌
doo doo balls recipe 1: crush ramen into rice grain size, toast in microwave until golden brown 2: add to tupperware bowl with heated peanut butter (seasoning optional) 3: shake in a circular motion and the ramen peanut butter balls will form
My ramen has to have broth
Cheetah girl is so cringe 😬
they should have revealed them to each other
they all lose. None of this looks like ramen
Oleaymayowa girl is a different breed when her ramen half way cooked wanna bee chef
Miss Cheetah girl ain’t it! She’s act like she’s on top of them tf 🙄🤣
Am i the only one who keeps the water in my ramen and eats it like soup
I like how the cheetah girl was so confident then only got 2 points cause the guy wanted to be nice 😭
bro cold ramen with soy sauce and lemon juice and a lil water, put in seasoning packets with the sauce best shit ever
Who eats Ramen with a spoon
how do you mess up ramen
New sub. I enjoy these videos so much. I wish we could watch their reactions to the other persons comments
i watched multiple videos from this channel and haven't heard anything nice yet, they only talk highly about their own food, it's weird
my family makes fun of those that eat dry ramen lmaooo
how dare they call it ramen with no broth, this is just noodles in a bowl.
Need some love for Ramen Mac down here!
The cheetah girl acting like her ramen was RAMEN like tf is that 😭
3:09 , gonna win? yeah okay.
“The ramen is a little watery.”  Isn’t ramen usually served in a broth??? 🤡
I have they not tried actual ramen except for the girl I the black shirt her ramen looks good but like wtf ramen Is supposed to have water this is what ramen should look like 🍜
Those noodles from the cheetah girl made the desert look moist 😭
Are people trained to be mean and disrespectful?
Cheyenne was really nice and I love shrimp! :)
The only reason she felt it watery is because her ramen has never even touched water 😐
It wouldn’t be ramen without the broth who the hell likes their ramen DRY 💀
as a kid with a father whos been in prison...ik how to make sum ramen and these kids did not cut it.
What broke college student is worrying about the color
My broke student food hack was Bacon, add an uncle Ben sweet n sour sauce and serve with pasta
okay but why does the cheetah girl act like shes the best at everything, and she also acts like shes a professional idk but she gives me the pick me girl vibes.
Why are they eating with ah spoon 💀
2:45 “This is just dry”   5:39 “I like my ramen dry” Wut💀
Cheetah girl is getting on my nerves if she ever serves us nigerians those noodle she would get a backhand slap all the way to london lmfao
the cheetah girl was the most annoying one like her noodles was the worse one there and she all acting like she a chef.
It is always the ones who have to most criticism that can't cook. Always
The fact that they’re judging ramen so hard pisses me off lol
......................🙄🤐
Girl had so much to say with her ramen looking dryer than Popeyes biscuits
This whole video ain’t cutting it. First of all, y’all eat ramen with a spoon...wth. Secondly, y’all eat ramen dry as hell then complain when the one girl actually has water in her ramen....the way it’s supposed to be. This video HASSS to be a joke 💀💀💀
The cheetah girl trash talked all of em  But in the end her ramen  was     d i s g u s t a  n d
Its always the rudest one that’s the worst cook LOL
Why are they all black tho?
all three of these ramens look unseasoned and disgusting
Where tf is the maggi
If there’s no moisture or broth in that bowl, I don’t want it.
Yes, the type of broke college kid that has enough money to buy shrimp to put on their ramen, and buy African spices to put on ramen.
Cheetah girl got the *Participation Award*
Chetta cosplay girl said Her ramen was *Something else, and Delicious* While her ramen isn't even cooked fully, is in clumps, and dry. It is something else, but it's  *something I don't want to eat*
I don't know if it's just me but hamburger meat in your ramen is *Delicious*
I think we should stick to grandmas , aunties and real food.
As a Nigerian, we do not claim cheetah print girl.   Nah Nah Nah I'm just joking but not all of us make our ramen like that I promise !!
I don't use the cups I use the packets
Don't ya'll know its supposed to be soupy?!  Marcus nope.  Olu. U talked a good game but hell no it wasn't cooked. Even if u put a cup of water and just use half the packet. Put some scrambled egg in there, chop up some fresh spinach and/ or mushrooms. You can put almost anything in ramen. It. Needs. Liquid. In. It. Otherwise, just eat it all hard and crunchy straight from the container.
Bruh I eat my ramen soupy NO other way 😩
this is really just roast other people’s ramen
She said its too salty After 30 seconds she said season the ramen This is why I hate thes thypes of videos. I mean like please people be honest if it is good say it is good why is there always someone who's gotta give other contestants a bad grade just so they could win... thats really shameful
Well I'm a fork person and I'm trying to figure out why are we eating ramen with a spoon😒😭😂
Just go make a prison burrito
I always learned how to make delicious ramen from my mom. I would always scramble an egg or 2 in a bowl and then add that, along with some velvetta cheese and hot sauce to my ramen. And I never drained the water. To me ramen is supposed to be a soup, not just noodles, because that's just boring and not as filling imo.
It’s always the one who’s rude that has the worst food. 😂
Cheetah girl "Its good but I would add my own seasonings."
Why is everyone calling Oluwamayowa the cheeta girl... she has a name
Lolol 1. Why are they eating ramen with a spoon. And 2. Ramen is supposed to have water/broth. Idk why they were shook when it actually included it. 💀
The guy: "You gotta put shrimp throughout the whole thing"... Well when you're broke-
The guy: "You gotta put shrimp throughout the whole thing"... Well when you're broke-
Am I the only one who thinks that these people are kind of rude 😬
😂he said the ramen was left in the streets after a hurricane 😂
Wait people like properly season Ramen I thought you just like pop some butter some salt in the packaging season and call it a day       Maybe I’m just crazy        And I don’t get how Olu did that like with the chunks  Before I open it I take this like chocolate milk churner and beat it
The cheetah girl didn’t even cook hers and she’s trying to talk ab there ramen-
do these people just eat there ramen with only noodles and nothing else like thank god for Cheyenne for at least adding what i think was a broth
Creamy chicken (yellow pack), drain some of the water, add a little bit sauce, a little garlic powder, and a little cheddar cheese.   That was what I did lol.  But how did that one girl leave it uncooked? Like why
Olu talking smack and lost so fast
“ This Is Salty Are you trying To Kill Me”
"I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" yours was dryer then the Sahara desert sooo
Who tf pours all of the water out of their ramen🤮
When the camera cuts to Cheyenne and you see that whole noodle block next to her bowl lmmmmao 🤣🤣🤣
RAMEN HAS WATER ACCEPT IT ALREADY
4:37
A fucking spoon......
3:11 I'm deaaad, so much for " bringing a different vibe "
0:43 and we have "ra-MEN" that just got me mad

Hello my name is O...shit..what did she say??
Bruh do not disrespect Nigerians as a whole by calling your uncooked, unsalted ramen "Nigerian Ramen" 😭😭 Even OUR spices can't fix that shit🤡
Do these kids not read? The directions are literally on the package. It says add water!!! Smh
I knew the sassy one couldn’t cook. She too busy dancing on TikTok lol
Cheetah girl be sayin it’s to salty and then that there ain’t no flavor like what
Lol do these people not know that ramen is a noodle soup? Like the broth is a key element.
Just blacks ok😕😕😕😕
I don't like super dry ramen but also not extra wet. It has to be just right.
ISSA CLUMPP 😂💀

Bruh why she keep bringing up jay atatagoon spice like she probably put it in her water
The one with the fro acting like hers was the best like that thing was literal chunks dude
Ramen is made with water, how tf is it dry?!
Bru ramen is supposed to have broth
They all look cute, but the fact that they are competing-  MS GIRL-
i dont understand why people like roasting watery ramen...i actually love eating mine with a lot of broth!
The fact that she said she liked hers dry, she didn’t even have to tell us 😭.
Bro, water is supposed to have water -_-
It's always the one w the most ego that's shit
Lmao she said I like my ramen a little more dry GIRL YOU BE EATING THE SAHARA DESSERT EVERYDAY
y’all don’t eat your ramen with the soup?????
How did the leopard print chick say the guys noodles were too salty and ten seconds later say it needed seasoning, 😳
Why don't they know what broth is? Did they not know it's ramen SOUP? 😭
"this shit look dry as hell " yes, yes it did
the satisfaction i felt when cheetah girl got a 0
Girl, your mom is not Spanish.
The cheetah girl didn’t pass the vibe check
I hate the cheetah  bitch
the “sorry to that man 🙄✋🏽” had meeeee
Let’s be honest all them noodles look nasty 🥲📸
Of course it’ll be nasty cause none of its fresh
best part all their ramen sucks cause real ramen looks nothing like that
If yall dont want ur ramen with soup and u want it to have flavor bitch just buy lucky me pancit canton its cheap and good
5:36 'it has water in it' ???? It's ramen??? It's supposed to have broth in it??? If anything, cheetah girl and the dude are doing the ramen wrong Ramen is supposed have soup in it, y'all
It’s always that one person who got the most stuff to say that ends up with the lowest rating😭😭
The cheetah girl is hella annoying
Thehehe Buzzfeed wannabee
Bro looks like Sid the science kid
Idiots it’s not water its broth
Cheetah girl needs to chilll she be doing the most for what 💀😶
Cheetah shirt girl:   Oh mah gah it’s so salty r u trying to kill me?!    Also her: There’s no flavor!!!
I'm not sure that should be called Ramen
They really out here eating dry ramen. They all need help. Throw some veggies in there. Come on people those just look sad.
the fact that they eat dry ramen pisses me off
Do these people even know how to eat ramen? You're SUPPOSED to eat the soup! Look up Japanese, Korean or any other Asian Ramen...seriously 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Y’all out here eating dry noodles?
I swear to god that people who talk the most shit are the one who has the worst food
Cheyenne is amazing I jus love her and the guy is just....there but the cheetah print dress girl makes my eye twitch
I finally gave in after weeks of this grossed out face
Cheetah girl really tried to win by talking the two others bad but tried to convince them with her minecraft chunk noodles? 💀
Bro I fell in love with Cheyenne she’s just a queen
All these ramen look disgusting
Olu is such a pick me lmao
They're so annoying, I don't believe the foods are always so bad as the contestants say
"and we have *remen* to save the day" repeat that again for me please.
why are they acting like ramen isn't supposed to have broth. this is killing me
"It has no color" NONE OF Y'ALL'S HAD ANY COLOR WHAT ARE YOU ON!?!?
i love how its always the ones chattin the most that end up with the worst score
“This shit look dry ash” 😭 I wanna be friends wit em
All that Ramen look undercooked like some shit
Everyone’s looked disgusting. I’m a college student and I manage to make it look and taste good. Peas, mushrooms, chili flake, parsley, mushroom powder, etc. gotta have some nice broth in there too,
why all the “broke” students black ? hmm 🤔
I'm actually upset at Olu cos I'm Nigerian and we DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT cook Ramen the way she did. Broke or not...lol smh
Wait.. who only eats dry ramen with a spoon? I always have ramen soup with chopsticks.
Just ad a lil lawry's not to much to get high bp but a lil bit for flavor. Butter as well. And throw some pepper in there for spice. Ik some people like hot sauce but I like my heart so I just add pepper that's all u need. Also keep a lil bit of water in it so it don't be dry
“I like the shrimp and it pretty good..” lmao she didn’t want to admit Cheyenne’s ramen was better than her
“I like mine dry” GURL ramen should have broth in it that’s where the flavor comes from
The pride in the Nigerian! I LOVE ITTT ❤️ She came with the spices and the seasonings
Bruh if I was on this, my ramen would win 100% no cap
PEOPLE RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOUP
I love how theres "Broke" on the title
It's kinda funny cause I'm Nigerian, and the cheetah girl was saying all of these native spices we use in our food, but clearly doesn't know how to cook 🤦 as if adding a whole bunch of spices equates to tasty food!
WTF ramen without soup???? It's illegal
Bruh they like their ramen dry 🤮
It’s not water it’s JUICE
She wasn’t even saying Ramen right of course it’s not gonna be right 😭😭😭
Mayoya is Nigeria
why is it 3 black kids representing broke college students...
Pleaseee I need the cheetah girl to know she lost like oh my god what she made cannot be called ramen. She gimme that vibe of someone who does not fuck w Asian culture until Americans steal it
cheyannes was the only one to look like ramennn😭
all that talk and no action😭😭
the fact that i just put the flavor packet in it and call it done 👁👁
NOODLE ABSORB WATER SOO SEASON THE WATER AND THE NODDLE TASTE BETTER
complaining about ramen having broth...
Shoutout to the girl in riverside. IE BabIE
The first thing each did wrong was buying American instant ramen instead of Korean.
Cheetah girl is really pissing me off
Ramen is supposed to be watery💀 thank god cheyenne won
notice how they all black @broke
I want ramen now😂
Not the leopard girl reaching for something bad after realizing it tasted good...
Sorry but the cheeta girl is getting on my nervesssss
All y’all ramen was bad 🤮
What I’ve learned from this is that the people to talk the most crap about their food always have the worst one 🤣
the girl in cheetah print was being so critical while hers was DRYYY ASF 😭😭😭
2:07 SHES CRYING OVER FUCKING RAMEN WHAT THE FUCKKK
CHEETAH GIRL NEEDS TO STFU
Dude naw man just get instant chicken flavored noodles cook it right and thats delicious
MEXICAN DADS TRY EACH OTHERS CARNE ASADA!!! PLEAASEEEE
If you followed the directions on any instant ramen packet your ramen would’ve came out better than any of theirs. And the two dip shits that said that said the ramen was watery obviously don’t know what ramen is. Maybe next time have more than just black people. They obviously don’t know what they’re doing when it comes to ramen. I’m offended
Why are they calling broth water ???
It’s always the people who talk the list crap with the worst dish
Rammennnn
who want dry behind noodles ... noodles must have broth juice ...what are yall even making
why are you making them eat ramen with spoons?                      idc about the ramen to h be honest but why did you do that......?
these ramens look so nasty, someone re-do this video but bring the koreans. Jeezus
Yo Cheyene was the only one that had proper noodles
Cheetah girl is a whole ass hater
Ramen is Spouse to have soup
Here's my issue. . .  These ain't kids in a dorm or in college. . . You wouldn't have the means to cook ramen correct, and they are acting as if the ramen is supposed to be healthy. . . Its packaged ramen, what the f!@$ were you expecting. It has literally 1400gm of salt ALREADY! ! ! Boogie ass lady bro. . . Like she expects 5 star ramen. . . Its from.a bag dummy.
“Is that hay?” I DIED 😭
bro but sometimes eating ramen without the water makes it lose its flavor as soon as you drain it
"Are You Trying To Kill Me?"... Girl You Try To  Give Them Uncooked Food. Uhm- NO, Honey You Try To Kill Them. Bye-😑
Why don’t they have forkssss i...
PLS why are they calling it water its SOUP IT IS BROTH
i was gonna root for Olu as a nigerian sister but uhh the ramen wasn't it for it.
BRUH THE PEOPLE WHO EAT THEIR RAMEN DRY ARE THE NASTY ONES, IT GETS ALL CLUNKY AND STICKY. the texture makes me wanna throw up, gotta have some soup if we're going the traditional ramen route.
Olu is so pretty
why they all black ?
They came with ramen undercooked right out the pack??? Look like dry sticky ass spaghetti with no sauce. Like how are y'all finding contestants? Also, no boiled eggs. Just sad. I knew which one won just by looking them.
Just saying ramen is meant to have "water" and if it doesn't then it should be classified as noodles instead
i LOVE Cheyenne.🥰  The guy is COOL.😜  But the cheetah print girl makes me wanna kill myself🤳
Ramen is suppose to have broth 😭😂
It’s funny how this video made me make some ramen
Wow this is so relatable. Dang
Olu and Marcus are clearly uncultured to the max. But miss cheetah print was the worst. Never been to Asia hun? Like for her to butcher my culture like that. Dry ass ramen? Sis what is that chunks? Gross. Wonder where she from learning how to cook like that. Marcus I do t know man you have no broth but and was mushy but it wasn't as bad at miss "idk how to cook". Cheyenne was the obvious winner she knows how to cook and was the closes to authentic ramen. I have a sensitive stomach so best believe I wouldn't have even tasted the other two.
Ms Cheetah need to sit down lol
If they want dry noodles, they should get those that are  made for stir frying
You can’t just eat the noodles raw bruh
Wheres the soup
I didn’t know you could be bad and making ramen noodles. 💀
LMFAO “there’s not enough shrimp” LMFAOOO YALL SUPPOSE TO BE BROKE COLLEGE KIDS
Duh it's good because she kept the broth. The hell is wrong with these kids, dry ramen? Strange as hell.
Cheetah girl is a narrsisist
Why they eating with a spoon
i be getting so much second hand embarrassment when these people at like theirs is so good and it sucks its so painful to watch lmfao
Cheetah girl be rude AF!!
she said its salty but underseasoned... cheetah girl confused lol
Cheyenne was humble and trying to be nice and I respect that about her but miss ma'am in the cheetah fit tried to act like she was a chef when her noodles look like they been through hell and back. 😀✋🏼
cheetah print girl was acting so stuck up for WHAT?
Why is the ramen dry??
That cheetah girl was so annoying and cocky
Why are they all acting like ramen isn’t supposed to have water/broth ? I hate how they’re all acting like professional chefs. Lol “I like my ramen a little bit dry” bro that sounds disgusting. Ramen isn’t supposed to be dry. Out of all of the ramen I would only want to eat Cheyenne’s. But fr why are they acting like ramen is hard to make. It’s easy and if you wanna add in your own stuff then you do that. I’m literally 14 and I can make better ramen than all of them. It doesn’t mean since you’re broke you should hurt your body with your disgusting ramen.
How do you eat ramen with a spoon 😐
First the cheetah girl said the noodles were too salty then says  it has not enough seasoning girl make up your mind
“It has no color” They all looked the exact same color wise
“It has water in it?” no shit it’s ramen it’s broth bruh
“I don’t like the water” bro it’s ramen. ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH IN IT
How bout everyone’s looked nasty 🤢

Olu's nigerian accent is satisfying, but her attitude sprinkles the bitter there hun...
only one of them made real ramen. If you don't have broth in your ramen it's not ramen.
can we just talk about that it's supposed to be BROKE cheap ramen?? chicken and shrimp that stuff expensiveeeeee
I love Ramen 🥰👌 I can whip up at least 8 different types using different Seasonings etc.. but I prefer homemade soups 🍲 , like sancocho, pozole, egusi or pepper soup, pho,ching po leung,  Japanese authentic Ramen, etc...
Okay now I feel like I am in fact the only human on earth that likes to have the broth with the ramen
cheetah girl dont know what ramen is, her stuff look all dry thats not ramen hun
Where did all the water go?!?!?

"I don't like all the water in it" BRO RAMEN IS A SOUP NOODLE
Olu is giving me elitist vibes. Girl your Ramen was fucking terrible lol
the two people who kept having comments on the ramen- that's how it's SUPPOSED TO BE
*where did the broth go?*  That's just flavored noodles with thing that you put, that ain't a ramen and don't ever call it a ramen
It’s always the worst cook in these videos that talk the most shit 😂
Where's the frigging broth? Bro you geeks need to go get locked up for 6 months then show me how ti make some SOUPS 🍲😒
It's the shitty  noodles that make it no good  you could seriously buy some noodles at the Asian market,  then get some Tom yum paste or something
What makes you an African GODDESS?
Ummmm..... Isnt...? Isnt ramen a soup?.......i just.. Last time? Im ganna say....that ramen ... Is a soup baby.
Olu is full of herself 😭
As an asian I love Cheyenne and hate everyone else 😐
I want to take that wig that Olu is wearing and run it over with a Semi
Y’all stuff dry
So they don’t like the water in it okay.....
Ramen is literally a soup it's supposed to have water😂
Cheetah gurl is too much 🥱
“its too soupy” “too much water” i- do people not know that ramen is supposed to be a soup? its just noodles if you dont add the damn broth 😀
You would think since they were broke and going through the struggle they wouldn’t be as nit picky
Two other college students : I don't like this it has too much water. DUDE!!! It's called soup!! Haven't you had authentic ramen? It's soupy! They just sore losers

To the girl with the afro she had  so much to say but her noodles were dryer than the sahara dessert.  she really said " i prefer mines a little bit more dry ". A LITTLE BIT? i'm shocked the building didn't catch fire from them dry ass noodles.
“this shit look dry as hell!” 😂😂😭

Cheetah girl: "I'm not tryna be mean but-"   *proceeds to absolutely bring down the dudes Ramen and praise herself*

RAMEN IS SUPOSE TO BE COOKED IN WATER🤦‍♀️
That Cheetah print chick who is a neuroscience major.... Never been broke a day in her life.
I think im one of the only people I know that leaves some of the water in my ramen, because I don't want just dry noodles- ya know what I mean?
"Are you trying to kill me?" girl your ramen is literally an insult to my culture. 😃😃  Edit: im not saying that its wrong but calling it ramen is like calling medium steak "well done"
no bc ramen is supposed to have water pls wth make a broth!!!😭😭😭 why are they eating ramen like pasta???
literally can the participants of this who made the best whatever be more humble like tf man u an ex broke college kid, not a masterchef
My ramen has lemon juice and texas pete and garlic powder onion powder salt and pepper and keep the juice
"I don't like water" GIRL HAVE YOU SEEN ACTUAL RAMEN????
All the Ramen look bad tbh but I know Nigerian food is good so I trust Olu
The guy : I'm gonna give it a 2 because atleast it's edible IM DEAAAADDD LOOOL
Please the cheetah print girl BETTER feel embarrassed after this one omg 😭😭
5:38 "I would prefer my ramen a little bit dry" A LITTLE BIT 💀
5:38 “I like my ramen a bit dry” yes bruh we can tell 😂
Them using spoons instead of forks or chopsticks is really bothering me
When she said sorry to that man I lost it💀😹😹

cheetah girl said she doesn’t like water.... says a lot about the chunky, crispy, undercook ramen girly

Are we not gonna  talk about  how cheetah girl said ramen and why did she change accent
Clearly cheetah girl and the boy don’t know good noodles Casue both of there’s looked the same cheys was looking good tho
“These contestants don’t even Stand a chance, Sorry to that man” this could be a popular sound on tiktok
Bro they are literally called chicken noodle SOUPS and they were acting like having the broth was weird
Why they eating with spoons 😭😭
why are they acting like ramen shouldn't have broth 💀 and the curly haired girl is gorgeous but she was being so annoying-
I don’t think you’ve reached true broketivity until you realize you HAVE to leave broth/flavored water/the cheapest stomach filling food aka SOUP 🍜 in the bowl for your own extended satiation. If the broth is inconvenient you ain’t brokebroke. And you also didn’t read the package it’s literally called ramen noodle *soup*
So y'all just gave up on saying Oluwamayowa's name,and resorted to just saying chetta print girl
My favorite ramen noodle flavors are vegetarian soy sauce, and the cheese ramen noodle cups. Which I can no longer find either flavor in stores. Sometimes I can find the regular soy sauce flavored. I do eat the chicken flavored one but I prefer the other two flavors instead. I do like eating the ramen noodles uncooked sometimes when I’m in the mood for something crunchy. But I never eat the seasoning packets alone.
Debt broke not going to get a life college  students that eat Ramen noodles...        Also cool fact you can get as much money as a good plumber as some doctors
Can we just send the Cheetah women to Gordon Ramsey just to see how she gonna get whoop by him...
Ramen is supposed to have broth!!!! Why are they eating it dry!?!? And why are they used spoons!!!?!??!?!?!? Grrrrrrrrrrrrr
This is most definitely scripted... I hope cuz...
“It’s too salty” then she says “theirs no flavor beside the chicken”🤦‍♂️bias asf
Olu:uhhggg it's too dryyyy Also olu: I like my Ramen a little more dry

Ramen is a soup dish 💀 people really dont realise that there is supposed to be broth in the dish thats where all of the flavor is, then you have garnishes like scallions or watercress and then you can add meats. But the whole point of ramen is the broth to flavor the noodles.
Bitches acting like Cheyenne’s noodles ain’t normal BITCH THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE A RAMEN MORE THAN THE REST
Crying in Asian 😭
My level of broke is, literally have the ramen only. No add ons
The cheetah girl bleached her hair and cut it into the bowls
They took all the water out.. the broth is usually the best part... I didn’t realize people strain all the water out before seasoning...
The cheetah girl was overconfident like your noodles weren’t even cooked gurl you tryna kill them and forgot to add this point  So, Ramen is supposed to be WATERY it’s supposed to be soupy the black top girl's ramen looked like ramen
Uff those two couldn’t digest the fact that Cheyenne’s ramen was good. First bite and the truth was out and then they started talking like critics 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ toxic
when he said “look it’s a clump” I FELL ON THE FLOOR😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“It’s too salty”  “Come on guys SEASON THE RAMEN”  ... do I need to explain this
I love how all of them are acting like they're Gordan Ramsay when in all actuality they don't realize that ran is supposed to be a soup. It's supposed to have a chicken or bone broth, the noodles either being cooked to al dente or fully (it depends on your likings). This is not ramen this is called people in America who don't know how to cook Ramen properly.
Cheetah girl goes to my University bro LMAOOOOO
The boy was trying wayyy too hard to be mean to the nice girl's ramen 😂
She said my first instinct is to smell it just to make sure that im not eating anything BAD.  Me : What the yours was a clump
none of these people know what the hell ramen is.  i bet they've never eaten it.
He said: This look dry as he**
Who eats rAmEn with a spoon
Abc cheetah gurl be like : “ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME”  Me be like : yours not even be cooked, like uhh
ARE THEY EATING THE RAMEN WITH A SPOONJdhdhdbdhdvsbsjs
Cheyenne is the only one who knows how to cook ramen noodles. The other two don't like "water" in their ramen...do u know what ramen is!? Its not spaghetti! Its not butter noodles! It has broth! Ok I'm done lol
Bruh these people dont know what real ramen is they aint even calling it right. Wdym they mean ''ew has water'' Ramen is a soup not some dry pasta. Anyways...
Guys your idiots you waste food like that just put it in poor peoples mouth and you'll see there reaction lol
In videos like this, there is always that one person who will bash on everyone else's dish and say that theirs is the best but then no one else agrees.
Bro they actin like ramen aint supposed to have water..
theyy are all black
The cheetah girl just acted like a brat the whole time.
The thoughts of ramen without water is sick! people it is supposed to have water 😂
i love how everyone with the ego in these is always the one with the lowest score and the worst food
HE SAID 6.5 NOT 9.5
are SHE using a SPOON, O.M.G I CANT WHATCH THIS
RAMEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER what is this :(
why is they eating ramen with a spoon😂
Is no one going to talk about the fact that they’re using spoons instead of forks??
the cheetah girl questioned the water and the salt UMM?????? this is ramen-
Eww keep ramen Asian 🤢🤢
“It has no color, it’s like grayish” what do u want it to be purple or sum 😭😭
why is cheetah girl critiquing it like its gourmet 😭 its like 99 cent ramen..
You guys should make a video on how they made it and have the other 2 make it too
Hate to break it to you girlie. But it’s called Ramen noodle SOUP for a reason. The SOUP is part of the meal.

So this is like a devil wears Prada but with Disney super villains

Cheetah girl   hello i am hatatguegnoop
*complains about it being watery* *dish is called ramen noodle soup*
the cheetah girl literally gave second hand embarrassment when she was flexing how good her ramen is and everyone hated it like shiiii- 😭😭😭😭
Am I the only one who just eats it with the seasoning that comes in the packaging...
Just bitterness all around. Why they talkin about the color?
Have y’all noticed everyone who’s hella cocky and confident in their food always got the worst rating?
cheetah girl is driving me insane
I’m surprised the cheetah girl is still alive after eating those damn uncooked  Just straight out of the pack ramen-
my naja sista please stick to cooking okele and jolof rice.
Cheers girl was super annoying. But anyway why did the other girl say “my moms Spanish” LMAO
Seafood Ramen, Aldente with broth and with bok choy and bean sprouts. With slight gochuchang paste in it. Side of kimchi. Idc how broke I am.
Cheetah girl scrolling through the coments like 👁💧👄💧👁
cheetah girl: “too salty ughh” also cheetah girl: “not enough seasoning”
Do they mean noodles? Isn't ramen the thing where they put like egg, meat and they make it watery? Idk- I feel like noodles is just pasta with no soup base thingy in it?
I have never had dry ramen 😂😂 Cheyenne did it Rightttt
Where’s the juice at tho??
i make my ramen noodles with spicy rice cake sauce, spicy rice cake, chopped onions and daikon kimchi, and an egg. it’s so good, try it!👌  (oh and i add water for broth ofc :D)
Buh I’m Salvadoran so I eat my ramen wit cheese and lemon
Ramen is a soup. It’s not supposed to be dry.
the cheetah girl reading the comments:👁💧👄💧👁
Her name is omae wa? That’s fucking dope
Am the only one that likes a soup ramen- like these all just look bland...
The dudes looked okay. It did look dry. The annoying girls ramen was crap. That was not cooked. The winners ramen looked good 👍
They all still made the ramen incorrectly. 🗿
It’s always the super critical ones that’s have the worst food 🤣🤣
Bruh, how are these even broke college students saying it needs more shrimp, aren't you broke?! 4 shrimp is plenty!  Grading Ramen (of my Asian people) which is normally served as a broth/soup 🤯  Who taught you how to make Ramen! It's on the package 🤦‍♀️🙅‍♀️  That's like me making fried chicken by boiling it 😂
cheetah girls giving a pick me vibe
they were straight up BAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Bye cuz this girl pissed me off
Yaaaalll ramen is supposed to have the soup/water ITS RAMEN NOT NOODLE
If she see this vid
I’ve noticed that the people who talk the most always end up with the worst dish LMAO
the boy is SO fake. literally loved it at first and invented something later.
😐is it not suppose to have soup in it
bruh
"Its watery"  ramen is literally soup with noodles lmao
idk last ime i checked ramen was in soup
I'm confused as to why they were confused that last girls noodles had broth in it. Do they just cook their noodles dry? Have they heard of ramen? And most importantly: i wanna know how cheetah girl cooks her noodles cuz that was just nasty!
RAMEN HAS SOUP WTF ARE THE TWO GUYS TALKING ABOUT?!!!
Do they know what ramen is coz wtf r yall eating that ain't ramen

Nobody cares but how I make my ramen noodles is.  1. I get chicken flavoring  2. Boil the water and put it in 3. Wait 4 Min 4. Put 1/4 seasoning in water for broth 5. Put 3/4 seasoning on it like a raft 6. Boil it for like 5 min 7. Drain most of the broth  8. Put little broth in the bowl 9. Put noodles in the bowl 10. Add siracha 11. Add 4 pepporoni's 12. Add pepper & Mix 13. Enjoy!

Cheetah print girl was so big headed 😩🤓
I thought the cheetah girls food was gonna look so nice because of how she was talking but😬😬
No water?!?
cheetah girl acting like Gordon Ramsey when hers isn't even cooked all the way🤣
They're complaining about being broke in college. Try growing up dirt poor, living off of food stamps, when  the food stamps run out, you watch your mom go out and panhandled just to feed her kids. Imagine having to eat ramen noodles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. No wonder they get called sellouts.
Why are they eating with spoons
We just gone act lik they didn’t come for them in the title ?😂
of course cheetah girl prefers her ramen dry. hers wasn’t even cooked 😂 also the point is broke college ramen.. of course there’s not a lot of shrimp
I honestly didn't know there were people in this world that don't know how to make cheap ramen...
UHH WATER???? BRUUH ITS BROTH RAMEN IS LITERALLY SOUP PLEASE-
this always happens in these videos.. there one person who does nothing but boast and talks badly the other contestants food but when theirs comes up it is horrendous😭
“Coming with a different vibe 😍”   Girl you didn’t even cook your noodles 😭🤢
“Let me add some afomenogiguugu and it would be way better” nah you already did to yours and it was cheeks.
wait i kinda wanted to see their reaction to their scores
The cheetah girl really pissed me off
lol the whole comment section is coming for the cheetah girl
Why does American instant noodles doesn’t look appetising at all.
i would’ve won this 😏
why they calling the broth water tho 😭
This NEEEDS a part 2
I wanna see cheetah girl with the long name react to her score Lmao hahah
“ it has water.. which is ok, i would prefer my ramen a little bit more DRY” umm.... we mf know..
Why is no one talking about the guy? Buddy went on and on about the shrimp ramen without even trying it -__-
Yall sound dumb fr saying you need to cook ramen, you dont need to at al 😂you can literally just eat it like a bread
Why the Nigerian girl disgracing Nigerians like this
The fact that they're trying to eat ramen with a spoon has me all kinds of messed up 😂 I can't
She actin like she know how to cook and her shit was the worst one I liked her before she started talkin no lie she's just one of those people who swear they can do no wrong and that evwrything about them is perfect lowkey hate her
these people can't cook which is probably the easiest thing to cook, AND they also have a really bad taste, the flavours they were trying to create were bad. And on top of that they had a real attitude for their cooking.   Not mention they're using a spoon.
Marcus and olu a lil bit too boujie to be BROKE
The guy nd nigerian girl noodles were dry 😂😂😂 did they drain the noodles completely. Gross. Like yall trippin
Not water it’s broth now bozo
Isn’t ramen a kind of soup though? Like isn’t it supposed to have water in it?
the cheetah girl is critisizing  the ramen like shes gordon ramsay its like she forcefully doesnt want to like anyones ramen but hers and she hyped hers up sm AND IT WASNT EVEN GOOD CHILE- IT WASNT EVEN FULLY COOKED PLS-

The lovely partner ipsilaterally arrive because oatmeal beverly dress around a holistic quilt. few fierce, careless output
I don't know what Ramen is dry....
Am I the only one wondering why they are eating ramen with spoons instead of forks.
Y’all, ramen is supposed to have water in it. It’s literally called ramen soup
They found it a problem for having water 😭
Nobody: Marcus: 👀 dis shit look dry as hell  Me: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Throughout the entire video I was like why the fuck is there no broth 😭
Who came here after watching Shakesauce vid?
Ramen should have water they clearly haven't seen actual, real ramen
Flamed
"Rmin"
That cheetah girls ramen more dry than a KFC biscut
Bruh you know these aint no broke college students bcs if you ever been broke before you dont complain about food like this
I thought ramen was suppose to have broth? 😅 because the first two didn’t have the “water” theyre talking about
Ramen is suppose to have soup in it unless it’s stir fried
Girl with the braids hand the ramen over looks bomb!
That girl wit the Afro. Throw it away.
WHERE IS THE WATER WHY ARE YALL EATING THE RAMEN DRY
"Is that a hair? No could you imagine, shut down the studio"...anyway
Who eats dry Ramen tho
oh no honey....they like their noodles dry ?????? NEXT CALLER NEXT CALLERRRRR
You think this is buzzfeed
There'll always be one Nigerian up there to embarrass us🤦
cheetah girl is like criticising other ramen when hers is not even fully cooked....like wth...you make ramen look pathetic
Broke college kid and they put some ingredients when I, a broke high school student just, yk, if I buy an instant noodle cup, I will just put hot water, wait for 2 or 3 min and eat it and if I buy an instant noodle in pack, I will cook it and put one egg and mash the egg cuz I don't like the yellow egg but if it's small I will eat it and wait for 3 min, I love it overcook and done. But they put that spice, this spice, chicken and prawn ;-; but hey, that's nice ig
Do the man and that other woman who tried the nice looking girl's ramen know what ramen really is 💀
In Italy you literally learn how to cook at 10, meanwhile college kids in the u.s. manage to mess up instant ramen. How?🤣
Olu was mad petty 😭
Cheetah girl annoying af
As an Asian this hurt me watching this
Reply to this comment with ur ramen recipes 😜   -Beef ramen with a little broth (not soup but not dry noodles)  - garlic powder  onion powder -Valentina sauce (if i’m feeling it)  - pepper
“it’s over salted” *next clip* “there’s no flavor to this”
Cheetah girl is doing to much
Ramen is soup wtf it’s gonna have broth
Isnt ramen... soup? Shouldn’t it have broth?
Ok but why are they using spoons to eat ramen 🍜
Cheetah girl gotta go
cheetah girl is Gordan Ramsey without the cooking talent.
My sister could make better ramen then the cheetah girl.
cheetah: i would prefer my ramen a little bit more dryyyy  girl...WE KNOW
So I’m originally from Asia and watching this disgusts me. Cheyenne’s ramen was by far the best and the fact that the other two hated on her ramen a little because it had water really irritated me. Ramen is supposed to have water..?  “Oh I like my ramen a bit dry” yours is undercooked, you have no room to speak ✋🗿
Bet I could make a better ramen using oriental ingredients lol
cheetah gave them straight bricks
“Broke” let me tell you, real broke student ain’t got chicken and shrimp in there
you need more atanagoon
5:37 😂😂😂we know😂😂😂😂
They cant cook no noodles I'm 12 in I can cook better noodles then them
Who tf eats noodles wth a spoon wtf
Ramen?
Y’all Cheetah girl comments killing me 😂🤣😭🤚🏾
That cheetah print girl acting like the queen and that her ramen is good while it’s Nigerian and is exotic.. uhhh girlie they look like clumps of not properly cooked ramen and they look mushy I’d give it a 0/10 myself lmao
Since no one said it  I ain't never seen two pretty best friends it's always one of them that don't know how to cook 💀💯
How bad do their ramens have to be, I’m not good at cooking at all and my ramen is bomb as fuck.
Alright, if a ramen has a dry packet you keep the water, if it has a wet sauce you drain all the water. That’s how I prefer my ramen.
"I prefer my ramen a little dry."  GIRL WE CAN TELL😭
people eat ramen noodles straight out of the pack they’re just cooked a different wayyyy
Cheetah girl is acting to much when her ramen isn’t even all that where’s your season and ITS DRY come on
Cheetah girl: I’m not trying to be rude  Everybody: CAP like that doesn’t make anything better
Cheetah girl was way too confident cause that ain't it😂😂😂
That had nothing bad to say about Cheyenne ramens cause theirs was trash.
I dont know what college students can afford shrimp or cheese or eggs :D
Never judge a ramen by its cover 👀
I don't know what kind of instant ramen you guys eat, but I'm pretty sure there are instructions in the back and a picture CLEARLY telling you RAMEN supposed to have BROTH.
Ramen is supposed to have broth in it to make it flavor full I-
Olu giving me toxic friend vibes ngl-
Do they not have broth with their ramen? Lol.
Honestly as a black person, I'm just worried about all the Japanese/Korean/Chinese etc people we've potentially offended with this. CHILE- DO Y'ALL KNOW HOW SERIOUS THIS IS??? We talkin' bout uncooked, dry lumps being called ramen. 💀🖐 Sincerest apologies.
Bruh this vid made me sooo embarrassed to be Nigerian.  And to think I actually got hyped and rooted for her when she described her dish only for it to be uncooked lumps.... mcheew Yorubas dey always fall person hand 🙄🖐
I’m sorry but I fell like the cheetah girl was trying to be quirky 😭🤚🏼
i dont like that olu girl- she kinda rude
Cheetah girl regrets doing this video i already know The damn comments i can'ttt
how do you undercook ramen lmaooo😭😭😭😭
Ramen is supposed to have “water”.
All of those look so dry to me, but then again, where I live it's basically a soup o noodles.
please give them a fork or whatever, but not a spoon.
Take a shot everytime that cheetah girl talks about how good her Ramen with her spices are
Where is the juice ?! Ramen is soup everybody noodles was dry lol
first girl has an amazing name , amazing hair , amazing skin and amazing eyes.  second girl also has an amazing name , eyes , eyebrows , lips and voice . the dude is just basic lol
“I don’t like all the water.” “I’d prefer it a little more dry.” Well if yall aint gonna season your ramen or add some spice the least you could do is add some soup.
my question is...    _can they use chopsticks_ 👁👄👁
They should have other strangers taste their food cause they always lying and trying to bad mouth smth that they know is good
cheyenne was the only one who made it correctly
6:20  GURL-  Since when is ramen colorfull?
i found it so weird when someone told me to try raw flavored ramen but it's actually pretty good
Lmaoooo bruh as soon as Marcus got his hand on the girl with the Afro styled hairs ramons, he went haaam lmaoooo
Cheetah girl needs to SHUT THE HELL UP
The guys reaction to just LOOKING at it to cheeta girls Ramen was HILARIOUS
Just because there black doesn't mean there broke give them a break
Hey whoever see this comment at 2:02 just image that he’s listening to her talk about his food n he’s only able to smile thru the pain. But don’t discard the other two not liking the others food
cheetah girl gettin me mad
"this shit look dry ash"😂😂
"It has no color." It's RAMEN. What does this girl expect?
"is that cheez-its" is my favorite comment.
Authentic ramen is literally served with broth, why is everyone's ramen so dry??
"Eh it too watery" 😐
The shrimp ramen looked the best idk what the others was doing 😂
why are they acting like there’s supposed to be no soup in it
olu that's y u lost u are too much
The one with the worst looking ramen had the most to say
why are they eating ramen with a SPOON
I would literally not eat anyone else’s ramen but cheyenes
Tradition eamen is suppose to have a broth. Cheyenne is the only one who did it right.
“Shout out to the shrimps that save the day”🙂👐🍤🥄
I knew her was going to be the worst bc she just kept bragging
cheyenne’s looks good lol
There’s a way to beat this game. Give the other two meals a 0 out of 10 no matter what. This will make it so the other meals have a max score of 10. All you have to do is make ramen that can get a 5/10 from both people and you win
ngl all they’re ramons are bad. just make regular ramon 🧑‍🦲✋🏼
the afro cheetah girl was WAY to conceded and in way over heels for herself
No one:  Not even Ariana grande:    Them: *eating ramen with a spoon*
Why do they like their ramen so dry? Honestly I think the best part about it is the "water"
Whoa whoa whoa did she really just say remin? It’s Ramen 🍜
she said she like her ramen a lil dry DRY or UNCOOKED
Olu was trying to win, you can tell because she’s giving everyone else’s a bad rating. But her ramen was- oof
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOME SOUP😭😭😭
" This isn't colorful" GIRLLL is it supposed to be part of the rainbow, just eat it, the nerve
these all looked so nasty 😭
Cheetah got exposed, she just crumpled up dry ramen and served it
I’m just tryna figure out why they are using spoons
You aren't broke if you put shrimp in it...
Omg, I know cheetah girl was gonna get a low rating but damn... they gave her ‘2’ overall 💀💀💀💀.
Us nigerians dont claim the cheetah girl. God forbid what is that
5:38 just a little bit dry huh?
Y’all can tell they’re literally play fighting
the cheetah girl literally said “i like my a little bit more dry” we can tell 😁
She said " I like mine a little bit dry" like bro ur stuff is a literal saltine cracker
First of all  Who the fuck eats noodles with a spoon??
Wait ppl actually cook there noodles without the like water and like soupy?😀🤠
I like mine slightly watery, so I'd vote high for the last girl.
The one who won was like “my mum told me if I don’t have something nice to say don’t say it”
She said my mom is Spanish 😂😂
NO TEA NO SHADE,But cheetah girl ...hunty
Did anyone see this video from shakesauce
people talking about water is making me mad, THE SHIT ISNT WATER ITS BROTH. THE WATER HAS SEASONING MAKING IT BROTH RAGE.
I wanted to see difficult name girls' reaction to her score lol
is- is ramen not supposed to have broth??? like why were the first to dry--
that african girl pissed me off...
rye cheeta print girl is giving me very much pick me girl vibes
Miss gurl disrespected us by talking about all the African spices she put in there... at least she tried...
That girl be talking to much smack for her noodles to be not even cooked😂🤚🏼
Cheetah girl over her talking bout and all these types of seafood bruh u broke and seafood is expensive what garbage u on
ravon is so dramatic thankfuly she lost :)
“Water” bitch oh my god it’s broth 😂🙃
Cheetah print was doing the most 🤣🤣
Moral of the story mind ya business 🤣
honestly cheyenne’s looked the best but they just had to pick it apart as much as they could 🐱🐱⁉️⁉️😫😫😫
who eats ramen with a damn spoon?
Bro it’s not water it’s soup😭😭😭😭
It’s like they’ve never seen an actual bowl of ramen before. It’s literally Japanese noodle SOUP. The broth is  the best part of ramen.......without broth it’s not even ramen, just noodles🍜
I use Korean ramen, add chopped tomatoes, Spanish chorizo, all purpose seasoning, everyday seasoning. Muwau. Cheap, cheerful. Love it hehe
The one girl literally found something wrong with the other ramen and said how hers was better every single time
It’s always the one that talks the most shit that has the worst dish
The mfs saying why does it have water. THATS HOW YOU MAKE IT
Ok. Isnt ramen normally soup base? Why everyone's ramen so dry.. lol. And for me, if im broke and want to make my stomach feels full, i won't skip the soup. The soup fills you up way better than the ramens i just watched. No offense. Lol.
“Water” “too much water” BROTH RAMEN BROTH RAMEN IS MADE IN BROTH OMFG that was irritating me. RAMEN IS SOUP 🍜
when you're broke af, food in any form is just food. for a bunch of college students who were/are broke, they sure do seem to be very picky with their ramen.
OMGGGG cheetah girl is being sooooo SASSY and SHOW OFFFF OMGGGGGGG
lmao wheres the broth ???
Why all they noodles look like that
Put me in coach! My ramen is so good 😩
Man ramen is not supposed to be dry!
Ayo I can’t even comment nothing because y’all already said what needed to be said😂
Isn’t ramen supposed to have broth? 😭😭
Tell me why they all black- 💀✋
Who likes dry noodles??? It’s ramen
These kids are too stuck on themselves and their style. Ramen is a soup initially. Dry is a preference. Season and garnish to taste. No one here can go to Japan with what they are making tho so, they need humility.
cheetah girl mmmmm i am not feeling nice today and u are testing me so bad rn ok
they acting like ramen is supposed to be dry
are they okay??? did they hit their head???? that ramen is fucking dry and they're coming at chenaye for making it normally 💀
why are they using a spoon   WHY ARE THEY SUFSJJF
First of all Ramen is supposed to be soup SMMFH 🍜 third Cheyenne is the only one who got it right change my mind
They be like it’s too watery or I prefer mine drier but do y’all know ramen has a soup?  It’s supposed to be watery
Y’all broke but drain that water, girl you got noodles AND soup, what’u doin.
Do we not know that Ramen should have soup?? #soupbase
your mom is Spanish?  😂
why are they eating it with a spoon tho-
why all three ramens look hella nasty tho o_o
Why all the ramen look dry? Where the broth 😫
Yikes y’all are coming down on the cheetah girl a lil too much very sus
Usually the people who talk the most ish on these food videos  got trash food haha.
Why did they complain about it having water lol ramen is supposed to have a broth
cheetah print girl : says ACTS LIKE A 5 STAR CHEIF THAT WORKED WITH GORDON RAMSEY AND COOKED FOR CARDI B  but...it looked like a block from minecraft 💀
ramen supposed to have water -_-
I like how the one girl goes all dramatic over it and says it's gross other than shrimp pretty much but her ramen wasn't even cooked like- why
why are the broke college students black
Bruh my ramen looks nothing like theirs, why don’t any of their ramens have broth tho
Why r they like “my ramen is the best” love.... it’s ramen.. from a packet...
its the negative bitches losing for me😭😭
The first girl who said her name I would never ever write my Name if I had that long of a name if I had a test still take me 10 minutes just write the whole thing
I’m glad I like my ramen the way I make it. Give me some pepper and Tony Chachere’s, I’ll be good to go.
LMAOO THE CHEETA GIRL WAS HYPING HER RAMEN UP AND GOT THE WORST SCORE

I like how Olu was so confident that her Ramon was good but it was really dry and she was acting like she’s the best Ramon maker in the world
Since when is ramen with water which is the soup is considered weird i mean comeon what did you cook you ramen with? Air?
look if you wanna put a title to your video remember not to put broke btw
“It’s salty like, are you gonna kill me?”  Bruhhhhh this gurl i mean its INSTANT RAMEN ofc its salty u can expect to have a slice of pizza and not get sauce and/or cheese. And “Chicken is an accesory, put some seasoning in ur ramen”  BRUHHHHHHHHHH SHE LEGIT JUST SAID ITS WAS TOO SALTY and now ur saying its doesnt have seasoning at all  I’m sry she just pissed me off
Why were they complaining about the “water” in Cheyenne’s ramen? I’ve never had ramen without broth...
me being an Asian and looking at their ramen, what did they just eat.
Is soup-less ramen like a US thing or something??? The ramen I know is supposed to have the soup base and then the noodles, it's literally a type of soup wtf were they on about with the "it looks flooded" my dude ITS A SOUP
Is that how y'all eat ramen ? No onions ? No veggies ? At least an egg ? No hot sauce ? Just why ? If you can afford chicken and shrimp you probably can get an egg and some veggies ! It takes literally 3 to 5 minutes to make and it tastes godly
Why did cheetah girl start crying when she didn’t like it wtf.
‘’ coming with a different vibe coming with a different TASTE ✨ ‘’  Meanwhile : This shit dry as Hell 🤨
I know damn well Cheetah girl ain’t saying someone ramen need color When hers Is Fresh out the PACK
all of those were actual garbage, literally no broth at all? no wonder there all dry
I wanna be a neuroscientist
She the ramem was salty and then she it had not seasoning how can something be salty if it has no seasoning
"we have RaNmAn to save the day".
The girl got a 2 and complaining about the other people food and saying it has no color
The last girls ramen looks bussin
I dont like her
I need Cheyenne to make me some ramen
why they drain the water?
im sorry but if cheeta girl doesnt stop acting like gordon ramsey im going to go off
Whoever oly whatever that name is she is fucking annoying
They cant call ist ramen when they eat it dry bruh
WOWOWOWOWOWOO "BROKE" and you pick all black people to do this WOWOWOWOWOWOOWW OKAY BUDDY #takedownbuzzfeed
I’m not trying the be rude or disrespectful in any way but the girl with the big hair is a little you know to to to much
cheyennes ramen is like classic tho like the broth and shrimp and shit
I’d just make it raw put the sauce and spices boom and eat it like a pizza
this is like that one girl who eats the ramen dry at school
“ my moms spanish “ 🤣
Remember that God loves y’all and sent his only son Jesus Christ to die for you and your sins amen God Bless 💞
Good matureness for college students-
Why were all of them talking smack about Cheyenne's ramen when it was the only one that can actually be considered as ramen because it has sauce and ramen is a kind of soup
I think the only one who could really make ramen was the girl who won Bc even though hers looked a lil nasty she didn’t make it dry and bland
im so confused... isn't the 'water' supposed to be there? it's a literal broth when you make it properly lmao
Bruh they slow asf😂
This is definitely cultural appropriation towards Japanese people
Bruh you're suppose to have a little soup or water in your Ramen. Idk wth cheetah girl did but shit looks like Frankensteins brain
The thumbnail 💀
Lol
Spoon!?
I’m so blessed to live with asian roomates. Hands down, best broke college ramen I’ve ever had. I low-key survived thanks to them.
1:13 this bitch so confident I hate her 2:01 2:05 2:16 I have proof 2:38
At this point I’m pretty sure the girl with the dry ramen is related with the sweet potato pie grandma on buzzfeed😗😂 same vibe
Everyone is like what am I gonna eat this morning tell me I’m wrong
The girl in the leopard print was dtm😭😂😂 she was pissing me tf off.
Uhmm that’s no Nigerian noodle please.. plus she’s so bitter. On behalf of my fellow Nigerians we I apologize cuz we don’t make noodles that way.
Why is it dry TF
It all looked nasty. They need to stop frontin 😅 and who eats noodles with a spoon???
I wonder how they would rate kyles Ramon 😂
Them: hating on chey at first   Taste it   Them: trying to find a way to hate still even tho they like it 😂
Everyone: trying to be a chef   Girl in black: mmmn this shi good
I put some lemon on it and I felt like a chef
Olu over hyped her ramen LMAOO then she immediately gotten a bad rating from no water or anything
5:38 we’r aware 💀
I don’t like all the water. Excuse me ramen is meant to have water and it has no color because that’s the way it comes.
Cheeta girl got on my NERVESSSSS
there are two types of people in the world children  and those are:   1. "Im not tryna be mean here but i don't like it at all its so salty like r u tryna kill me? [laughs in pain]   2. Oh mah gawd  this is really- this is really good  its kinda like regular pasta and then chicken they seasoned it well.
how you gonna complain if your hungry and broke? “salty” “weird texture”
Talking bout not seasoned she ain’t been thru no struggle
bro they be complaining about the water in it like, have you had traditional ramen before?😭✋
Even though Cheyennes Ramen do look a bit soggy it’s supposed to be a soup the whole point of Ramen packets is that they are soup not stirfry Ramen , even though I’m not a fan of seafood I feel like Cheyenne Ramen had more accented flavors actually go with the original Ramen packet because the first two were very very dry and the way I make my Ramen as I leave a tiny bit of water just so the noodles have some moisture and aren’t just completely dry
None of those ramen had liquid.... im so confused.
bruh why i am watch this
Cheetah girl talking all that when her’s looked the worse shame😭😭
"I don’t like it too watery" it’s soup..........
He did not say maruchan like that 😂😭
ramen is literally supposed to have broth
my ramen recipe Pork maruchan (i perfer top ramen but pork maruchan hits) medium boiled egg (medium= 5 minutes) Poke little holes into egg and marinate in soy sauce, sesame oil, korean chili paste, and little sugar) When the noodles r done add the powder then the egg with sriracha on top..mm bomb asf
I'm sorry but all of their Ramen looks like shit. Like that aint Ramen
Where is the BROTH????
What the actual fuck was this video. This was a federal fucking offense goddamn💀💀💀 There is so many things wrong with these 3 individuals 1st of non of them can make ramen to save their fucking lives. And 2 they were all so cocky and acted like snobs whata joke.
it's just a ramen, they acted like they were in a cooking competition LOLL
Tell me why the other 2 be hating on the last girl who obviously did a much better joooob 😂😂😂
As a certified poor college student and ramen connoisseur, the best technique for better noodles (cause theirs looked VERY dry other than the last girl)  is to with a stove: boil 2 cups of water and once a bit of steam is visible from the pan you put the noodles. Once it is bubbling (like, actually boiling) and the noodles have separated you insert the msg pack into it and spin it around a bit. Turn off the heat but leave the pan there and put a top on so that the noodles can become smoother and absorb just a bit of the soup. Monitor the noodles until it has gotten to your liking (I recommend around 5 min for the perfect texture)  I recommend fried egg and (cooked) spam on it (best combo)
How the hell they eating ramen with a spoon?
Wish there were more diversity in people and more contestants. I’m a broke college student and literally make Chapaguri with my boyfriend all the time 😂
Who eats ramen with a spoon?
Anyone here from shakesauce?
Am I just the only one who eats ramen with the broth??
6:26
Nawl i need to talk to the girl that talked all that shit and tell her, her ramen was trash
Do y'all not know that RAMEN is deadass a Japanese SOUP!? BRUH "It's too liquidy" sis did it right, and i aint even try it!
2:20 DIDNT SHE SAY IT WAS SALTY SO HOW DOSE IT NOT HAVE FLAVARRR
“Like” if you like ramen with soup; comment “me” if you like it dry. Let’s see who wins. 🥊
The photo of this video in the recommendation already gave me that idea, how this video will be gone.
olu or whatever her name is wayyy to pretty to be a bad cook. Like how do you mess up ramen-
They’re complaining about the water?!!!! I drink that shit 😭😭😭😭
lesson: dont talk trash
Why are they eating it with a spoon😭😭😭
notice how all of them are black
“It’s salty.” It’s fucking ramen. It’s garbage food that no self-respecting person eats past age 25. Of course it’s “salty.”
“I like my ramen a little more dry” girl we know 🤡
Can I just ask, Dry ramen?!?!? Wtf?
Eww is all I can say
bru what kinda ramen are these people getting mine is like 1 dollar total for 1 packet plus the water and electrical bill what
Of cause they are going to say their's is the best you should have had other UNI (College) students come in and try.
It’s salyyy... aRe YoU tRyInG tO kIlL mE
Do they know what ramen is... it consists of broth. Tbh the only person who almost made it right was the girl in the black shirt.
“It’s too watery” “I like mine more dry” BRUH it’s literally soup-
Hay
Am I the only one who keeps a lot of water in my ramen...?
Lol they're faces after they bashed Cheyenne's ramen but realized that it actually taste good 💀
I was broke as hell I would walk pass the bananas n smell them n be like ok that's good enough
Broke ramen recipe trust me it’s bomb chicken ramen with lemon and tapatio  (and if you have it you can add melted cheddar cheese preferably no water)
She likes it dry but when she tried that guy’s ramen she said it was bad and it was dry bruh
I really wanted to see the look on cheetah girl’s face
Are we not gonna acknowledge them eating the Ramen with a spoon?
There’s not enough shrimp you did not even have shrimp
This is too particular?   No, just me o_o
That girl got a 2. And she's dumb asf. She being picky and got a 2😂😂
Why they ramen dry .... Dam what happened to the juice 👁️👄👁️ eww wouldn't eat any of them periodt
Ramen is supposed to have broth how is it flooded
Is no one going to notice how Marcus Is literally David Dobrik
6:31 ofcourse there's nit enough shrimp she's broke broke dumb ass
"It's a little too watery" duh it's ramen????
Cheetah sista must’ve forgotten that your ramen is not pose to still be crunching after it’s cooked😅that’s like eating medium rare steak, got the cow still mooing
Broke college ramen recipe- samyang noodles with oyster sauce, honey, fried egg and kimchi. Trust me it’s worth a try. (If you can’t take the heat add some cheese)
I don’t think Nigerian instant noodles are that good. I don’t think they no how to make noodles
chetaah girl reminds me of "where's the flavour“ women 💀
everyone repeat after me " i well never be this down bad in my life"
5:52 and thats when cheetah girl noticed she was gonna lose
I like how they expect perfection from Cheyenne when she literally has the best lookin ramen
Wait 😳 there’s people who don’t like the soup in their ramen and only eat the noodles dry?
Where’s the soup
The so called African Goddess is the type of peron to cook a 5 minute noodle package for 3 minutes because she wanted to seem smart by doing it quicker.
I know dang well cheetah girl ain’t talking LMFAO
„It has water in it, which is ok I guess“  since when are we acting like ramen isn’t a soup?
5:39 girl we can tell
You have to have water in your ramen
b r u h. why are they eating the ramen with s p o o n s ? ? ?
Indonesians be like: we don’t need other meats / seasonings, one packet of Indomie will do the justice😂
cheetah girl put the raw in ramen
The girl with the afro just has bad sportsmanship, shes a faker and a liar🙄
Honestly the cheetah girl is getting on my nerves😭
The cheetah shirt girl needs to sit down bc hers ain’t all that and it seems like a bric and ain’t ramen supposed to be savory
“this shii look dry asl”
Dude they need to try mine I call it toast and it’s really good
They were saying the 3rd girl had to much water!!!??? They would have hated mine
"ra·men /ˈrämən/ Learn to pronounce noun (in oriental cuisine) quick-cooking noodles, typically served in a broth with meat and vegetables."  Ya'll, why is it that the only person who made decent ramen with a broth, gets dissed because there's 'water' in it? XD Do they not know what ramen isssss???? it's supposed to be wet or like he said 'slimy'.  "Fill cup to inside line with boiling water from kettle or microwave. 2. Close lid and let stand for 3 minutes. Stir well and enjoy."
hold up- y'all don't eat ramen with water. i have it like soup. i-
Y’all... I may be missing something but      They was using *spoons* 🤠🤚
Bro why they like "And we have ræmæm"
Olu talked so much shit only to be slaughtered lol poor girl.
Cheyenne is a queen The guy is just ok The Cheetah girl is making my eye twitch-
Love how this olu girl be acting like she is the best when the other people couldn’t even try it at first 😂
I'm only 2:46 minutes in and i can already tell the girl in the cheetah print or whatever prob comes in last.
Japanese citizen will be crying over Olu and Marcus ramen for having dry ramen like the broth is what makes the ramen delicious 🤦the noodles are nothing without the broth
The fact that she was acting like she has the best ramen then it turns out to be horrible
BRO NOTHING IS WRONG WITH CHEYENNES RAMEN YALL JUST SALTY
not gonna lie the girl with the curly hair pissed me off, she's like one of those girls who thinks she's better than everyone
wheres the fuckin water. throat be raw dogging the salt holy shit
do these people realize actual ramen is soup?
I’m actually starting to think these are staged, cause in all of these “people try other people’s stuff” there is always one judgy person that thinks there the shit and happens to get the lowest score.
These peoples taste is horrible but at least the girl with the ponytail know how to make ramen, the rest just have terrible taste buds ;-;
Ok but who tf uses a spoon to eat ramen?
why are they  using spoons...
the 2nd one is closest to how i make mine. i detest foods that are too soft, so my noodle tastes are specific. some say theyre undercooked, but to me its just very al dente. instant noodles will continue to cook as im eating them, so i have to underdo it at the start
Ramen literally have no color and hers wasn’t even cooked ! Sooooo.... what is she talking about ???
i know they not judging ramen-
"i prefer my ramen a little dry.."   Gordon Ramsey: ITS F***IN' RAW!
Nobody is this video has ever heard the phrase "Don't knock it until you try it", especially the cheetah print girl
Bro that one with the Afro got to much ego
Why do they like dry and soft ramen though
Pause and laugh 😂 at 5:52 seconds 😭😖
They’re eating the ramen with no soup
Lol
I always root for the kindess person!
one more thing ...the slightly crunchy ramen is good with a tuna and chip mix. I like spicy chips so I say hot cheetos . I have a lot of opinions on ramen.
ok, so I will shout my jail pop here and say you needed to try a SPREAD.....take the noodles.....smash up the hot cheetos add mayo and maybe some sausage and some dry refried beans.. ALSO try boiling the noodles in the microwave until they take on a clearer flavor......oh and sriracha...... also good is a mix of gardetos and jalapeño cheetos.
SHE GOT A 2 LMFAO WHAT-
"I prefer my ramen a little bit more dry"  THEY NOTICED
“A tsunami hit and this was the ramen that was left on the streets” 😂😂
where is like the soup? only one has the water...ramen i'ts a soup how are they complaning abt the water, the animal prin girl hyped her ramen so much and it legit looked the worst...we-
I could do so much better... Watch some bento videos please 😭
Bitch your mom is not Spanish lmfaooo
Olu can stfu tbh.
The girl was trash talking even though her sucks
Why are they eating it with a spoon thi
Boi ramen needs broth its not just noodles😑
cheetah girl needs to SIT DOWNNN
2:47 yea uh she gets on my nerves -
college students are judging each others ramen and they are acting like chefs judging each others 3 course meals XD oh lord
why is olu acting like a major league food critic lmao it's packet ramen
me tryna figure out if her mom is Spanish or Mexican LMAOOOO!!!!!!
Man they  would roast mine, I leave all the "broth" add a crap ton of lime and valentina hot sauce and call it a day lol
How can you call these ramen? Like honestly? That isn't ramen! And chicken for a broke college kid's ramen and huh? spices? Fuck egg is the only thing I can add when I have money. and maybe salt when I add too much water!
I like how her ramen is “exotic” but it looks like a Minecraft block.
BRO THEY WERE USING SPOOOOOOOOONS
I think I'm gonna stick with super noodles
Why are they all black
All nasty
Ig she is from nigeria they also put fish and etc. In there my aunt does that alot...
I hate the cheetah print girl. She’s so so rude and horrible. It backfired though lolll
ramen is supposed to have "water" in it.
I just want to se what the girl in the orange shirt would have said after she saw she got a 2 she was talking like she put all this seosinging in and all this and she got a 2
And thats why they lost like stfu and eat it your not on no chief show
Loving how they are all pissed at the water while ramen is technically a *soup*
Cheyenne is such a sweet girl
the ramens watery like tf cup ramen is literally hot water and noodles
Bruh homegirl came in like mines the best

Ok but why are they eating ramen with a spoon 😕
these kids personalities reflect on why they aren’t studying anything career worthy
I've seen and made way better ramen than this for cheap lol
Why don't any of these have some veggies? Definitely missing out and yes, that's a broke way to do that.
"i dont like the water" the broth is like the best part
The sassyness came back around to her/Instant carma
“I don’t like the water” Bro that’s the best part?? 😧
But why are they all black? If the roles were reversed this would be racist
Why is they shit so DRY
The dapper nail explicitly memorise because closet immunophenotypically pump worth a exciting exclusive colombia. remarkable, glamorous cinema

Curly head was so judgemental , then over hyped hers and got 2.  The other girl wasn't so extra  and was professional .
Of course the most over confident one was the worst one lmfao
The cheetah girl: “ it’s looking kinda dry”   Me UR RAMEN WAS RAW

RAMEN. HAS. BROTH. IT'S NOT JUST NOODLES. "WATERY"???? IM DISGUSTED
all of their ramen is awful...when you dress up ramen it should be : extra seasoning, an egg, frozen veggies + ACTUAL BROTH because the water helps fill you up  these are the "broke" kids who complain about having no money but mommy and daddy still paying their rent
olu is over here saying other peoples ramen is bad meanwhile hers is horrible
The last one was the only one the looked like ramen lol
Thing is that nobody is talking about is how none of them know how to make ramen
Quick question why they eating ramen with a spoon
Everyone is commenting on the noodles, but i would've served mine with chopsticks to begin with, the spoons freaked me out.
Eating noodles with a spoon 🥄 is crazy 🤯🤣 noo wayy!!
1 out of every 3 teens believe they can cook Gordon Ramsey style😂😂😂 bbg noooo, she over here talking trash about everybody ramen and then got two points😂💔
BRO RAMEN IS LITERALLY SOUP AND NOODLES??? i literally make milk and seafood ramen, tons of broth and milk mixed in, miss me with that dry shit

That bitch said the ramen was salty then back tracked and said it has no flavor which one is it bitch
The way she said are you trying to kill me
All of there noodles look dry
“It has no color” girl what color you want it to be bright green 😭🤚
really olu you embarrass the Nigerian  food
That girl was so confident and no one liked it
Ayo chunk chunk chunk chunk
“Are you trying to kill me” girl yours wasn’t even cooked, you’re trying to kill THEM.
"Broke" 😂😂 funny af ... Beggars cant be chooser ... 1. Cheetah print chick didnt even cook it coming with all the attitude 2. Shrimp in the ramen wouldnt be cheap   Here are my ideas for cheap ramen Spicy ramen - grab a bowl put some szechuan sauce maybe a drop or 2 not much put water in the bowl stir add noodles microwave 60 seconds flip then 30 seconds  Soy ramen - same as spicy but after adding the szechuan add a little soy not much but enough to thinly color the bottom of the bowl  ... Wanna add a little something you can get a head of lettuce get a few pieces after the 60 second heat up add the lettuce under the ramen you flipped ... Bam simple easy cheap af while giving you some taste but everyones tastes are different and its good to experiment with what you like and honestly you dont have to go crazy with it for it to be good or spend too much (sauces are long term cheaper typically and can mask if you get a flavor you dont like as well I prefer chicken ramen to shrimp but shrimp ramen can be cheaper) 🤷
Ok call me weird but I love my ramen to have a broth. It makes it so much better and makes my egg have flavour. They are so mean
Why tf dey eat noodles wit a spoon cuh
uh , this was a joke right? 😂 i mean its instant ramen so ngl feels kinda weird to me  that they all trying to comment like some fancy chef . its instant ramen 😂
Bruh ever head of broth
The Nigerian chick only know them 2 spices and think she fye 😂
It’s the “I don’t like water” like it’s suppose to have water🤦🏽‍♀️
I want to cook my ramen how do I sign up ?
Welcome to my dorm...
THE girl: SEASON THE RAMEN THE RAMEN MATTERS 👁👄👁

Excuse my laughter but the way olu kept trying to act all special, and exotic and the way her ego was just above the charts and she ended up getting a 2 was halarious to me 😂
isnt ramen supposed to have soup? why are they complaining 👩🏽‍🦯
Am I the only one who actually eats ramen like a soup ??
None of y'all can cook for shit lmao
I love they are broke college students yet they act like they are the best chefs in the world lol. Glad that one woman got the lowest score. Too funny.
I really wanted to see their reactions to what places they came in, especially the dry at ramen girl who thought hers was the best
6:18 girl really said the ramen has no color and it be looking gray, AT LEAST IT AIN’T STRAIGHT BLOCKS
You know your ramen ain’t taste good when someone asks “what’s wrong with it” and the person that’s eating it replies with “Idk it’s everything for me “
These people do not know how to make Ramen 💀
He wants more shrimps? Even though its a BROKE MEAL????
Some Ramen should  be censored
What if you had to spend 100 days on a desert island all alone? What 3 things would you take with you?
God Bless fyp and Amen 💖
i dont like olu 😭
This video made ramen look so unappetizing 😂
Dude was trying so hard to win talking bout I take everything I said back like dude you just wanted to win and don’t get me started on the other girl like baby your stuff was looking like bricks

Yesh the girl who is a neuroscience major would not have good patient bedside manner's. She's a little mean
I’m not trying to be rude.... what am I eating are you trying to kill me? Just no this isn’t mine... I can’t handle this. Mine wins.
.

College kid struggle ramen or college kid ramen recipes lol 😂
Everything I said on the first bite was wrong 😂😂😂
You're on a another level if you're that worried about the color of food lmao
Literally the sweetest attitude won! 😂
Olu was so confident but then she got a 2- 😭✋ she tried to hard
Here's how I were to make a broke ramen dish. Considering they used chicken and shrimp, I'll use anything less than that. Shrimp is at least $7 and chicken is at least $5 where I am. So my budget is $6. Eggs - $1.29 sesame seeds - $1.00 bean sprouts - $1.79 roasted seaweed snack - $0.89 ramen - $0.33 Total is $5.30 Cook your ramen to desired cookness, add in that delicious msg after draining most of the water. While the ramen is cooking, boil eggs for 10 minutes. I put in my eggs in cold water and wait for that to boil up. Add salt to the water. Then decorate with bean sprouts, seaweed, and sesame seeds, placing your eggs on top. Boom.  edit: other substitute add ins would be bok choy, bacon, and beef broth.
mfs acting like chef boyardee when ramen only takes 5 minutes to make
She has a name and it’s not Cheetah girl , treat people with respect
My Ramen recipe (for when I don’t eat my Korean ramen)  - Use chicken ramen and cook it normally, leaving the packet to the side - put your seasoning packet in a bowl while the noodles cook - add soy sauce, hot sauce (your choice, I use Sriracha) Cayenne, garlic powder, paprika, parsley, and basil to the bowl - put your noodles (WITH THE WATER ONG) in the bowl and mix it up - put shredded cheddar cheese on top and melt in the microwave  (I never use exact measurements, you will just feel it in your soul)
The title though
Wtf? Does everyone from where they are from eat ramen with no damn soup?
Shrimp?!? Who can afford shrimp when they're broke?!?
Why does American instant ramen look so disgusting
They didn’t want to bring an Asian person because the producers knew they would have destroyed everyone else
why were they using a spoon? doesn't most ramen have like broth? i don't mind broth no offense, but y'all got people who cannot make ramen except for the last girly
why are they all black doe?
this is fancy ramen 😂 I just put hot water
i love how the girl with the fro was talkin shit on the other peoples when hers was like 2 lmfao
bruh i was expecting the nigerian girl to make some indomie but noooo
Even I can cook ramen better than they did even tho I don't cook a lot :-)
"The ramens a bit watery" girl i wouldnt be talking if i ate the ramen straight from the package with a lil spice
She hyped up her ramen so much and they didnt like it. I startin to feel bad lol
From one Cheyenne to another, i knew you were gonna be the coolest of them all lmao
his looks pengggggg
The girl with the curly hair is so rude like wth
that curly hair girl got so much karma
do people not eat ramen with broth
Man Marcus won that lol
cheeta girl is getting on my nerves she keeps complaining but her noodles were dry asf 🙄
Ramen is supposed to have some soup in it..idiots
“to add a reddish colour” girly what 😩ramen should not be red bby
5:38  yeahhhh wbn
the one with the fro was talking so much shit it was blowing me 😭😭
Who doesn't leave the water/broth in the noodles these dudes are noobs
This title is absolutely ridiculous...you could have kept it at college kids. Eating ramen don’t mean you poor🥴 y’all love entertaining dumb shit like this❕racist shit.
I love the title ✨BROKE✨
but why are they eating ramen with a spoon ???
Who wants to tell them ramen is supposed to have water 😭
I thought this was broke college students, these had shrimp, chicken, spices. When I was in college I was taking toppings from my college salad bar during lunch, adding sriracha or hot cheetos. Also who on earth eats ramen without some broth, like my word.
All of them were nasty 😂😂😂
Literally where was the broth in all of them except Cheyenne’s? They all looked sus minus hers.
pls change the title to instant ramen like wtf is this im cryinggsgg
That lady was expecting gourmet ramen from broke college kids. Makes me wonder if she was actually a broke college kid. She didn't seem to know how to cook it in the first place.
So they don’t like the ramen with WATER IN IT?! DO THEY NOT KNOW HOW RAMEN WORKKSSS 😭
The one in the cheeta print shirt talked a lot of shit for theirs to be dry as hell
Where’s the diversity
Shoutout to the shrimps that saved the day ✊
I know she wasn’t trying to be bitchy but omfg😂😂😂😂
Yall are all talking abt cheetah girl but I’m gonna just be honest:  i do not like her
Little miss whatever the hell her long name was, is so annoying 😂😂 ITS RAMEN CALM YOURSELF
All of asia when they said it has too much water : 🗿
Bye cz that Nigerian was so cocky nd ha shit sucked😭😂
When African hate African food😂😂😂
this makin me wanna make yall some maggie curry bruhh 💀💀
They did my girl dirty lol
Bruh im a college student and broke and i can make far better instant noodle recipe than all of them, but the fact that is ridiculous is the way they are bragging about their ramen
Broke collage students? What a insult ._.
ramen is served with hot water, anything to argue with it?
Remen
Istg asian broke college students cook a better ramen than theirs... I never saw a bland ramen like that here. Our ramen is full of spice and red coloured. We can turn it into a pizza, fried, soupy and so on. Be creative and of course, should be tasty and flavourful. Not just season it with salt and pepper only
" I prefer my ramen a little dry" we know don't worry.
the one w fluffy hair saying they noodles too dry made her ramen look like dry basmati rice 🤣🤣
Have you noticed how , in these challenges, it’s always the nicest and honest person who wins and the overly egotistical people who scores the lowest😭😂
cheetah girl is acting like a whole ass chef when her ramen ISNT EVEN COOKED FULLY
Bro she was toooo mean for her ramen to be clumpy
“Ewww it’s too ✨salty✨ are you tryna kill meee??😖💅🏻”  Bitch it’s RAMEN if you eatin this then sodium is probably the last damn thing on your mind 💀
As soon as I saw that prawn 🍤 she won🥰 I love the water, how can you eat noodles dry
Oul is so mean
I already knew the nice girl was gone win
Why they so picky its ramen from a goddamn plastic bag
As an asian.. none of these are ramen..like wheres the soup- wheres the color.. LIKE YALL THIS AINT RAMEN- they be acting like its the best ramen out their..
Why the Nigerian girl so arrogant lmao
Why are there so MUCH complains? Just eat the God bless food!
The girl who kept talking about color and how she likes hers "a little dry" GIRL WHAAAATTTTT YOURS WAS JUST STEAMED HAY WITH NO COLOR
how tf are they eating it with a spoon.. and ramen is supposed to have liquid in it. im horrified
I find it hard to believe the Nigerian girl was broke
I like to make my ramen 'satay' style with peanut butter lol. I'm a broke student and it's the only way I can stretch packets out and have it fill me up and be calorie dense enough. Plus I think it tastes good, but can understand if some would find it nasty.
First off why they using spoons 🤔
The one with the worst ramen talked the most shit lmao
“it has water in it”  girl ramen is SUPPOSED to have water in it “i like the shrimp, it has variety” shrimp is usually in ramen,,
I thought you’re broke it’s stfu complaining about color
I think the ramen matched the peoples personality..
The comments brooo 😂
I hate dry noodles it has to have some water not to much but like a little bit
They honestly don't know what the f**k ramen is
Lmaooo the cheetah print girl 💀
The ramen as INSTRUCTIONS 😑
All of em are weird and too proud.... bruh just make the freaking ramen with the flavors they come with, no need of adding extra shit on em. You can add meat cutlets or some veggies, but that’s the most u can add in my opinion.
The ramen shouldn’t have all the flavor the broth should but yes college the packets will be your broth flavoring
the cheetah print girls noodle dry and crunchy like her hair
I have never seen ramen made like this 🚶🏻‍♂️
OK this video triggered me. I don’t know how y’all be eating your Ramen but isn’t it supposed to have water in it?? it’s kinda like a soup! please correct me if I’m wrong. I believe traditional Ramen is made with a broth. Why are they eating it dry???😭😭😭
i hate olu tell her i said that
Did she really just say my mom is spanish 😭😭
ik u aint talking when ur ramen is dry af
Nah y’all are mean as hell
i'm making ramen rn lol
Ramen originally came with broth..
Is alway the one who talks the most shit who has the worst
Girl it is dead!! The fuck
It always be the one that gives the lower grades that gets a lower grade!
How do y’all make your ramen? Go
Her ramen had like 3 teaspoons of water
Too watery? Lady your ramen was dry n lumpy
Loool I knew who was gonan win. The nicest ppl are always the best. And the ones talking THE MOST sh*t is always the nastiest 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i just knew the girl in the leopard print shirt couldnt make ramen lmfao
Baka
Ramen is a soup... there is supposed to be liquid in it...
The dry ramen/instant noodle actually describes how hungry and/or broke you are in the college if it were in my situation. Like Bro: “man,I’m hungry ,you have some ramen bro?” Me: “ye” Bro: *open the package, pour spices into it, smash, and shake, then eat*
Why they eatin it with a spoon and not a fork
nahh they all foul
Olu is so annoying
Dry ramen can be good Has anyone tried ppushu bulgogi dry ramen? It’s amazing and has the right amount of savory, spicy, and sweet
The selfish attic certainly pour because wool epidemiologically suck anenst a puzzled quartz. standing, unnatural cupboard
Imma be real.. they all looked nasty 😂
Why don’t those two like broth??? It’s ramen - it’s meant to be a soup???
Did she just say her mom was Spanish 🤨 she definitely meant Mexican 😂
Why is it always the uber confident ones who have the worst food?
Everyone: talking about the ramen Me: WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON?!
ramen is supposed to have broth...
I thought this was a joke video lmao but they're dead serious
why do all of these look overcooked to crap.
The bitch wit so much to say had the worst noodles 💀💀💀 baby be humble or eat ur words😌
Omg the girl with the Leppard print shirt and the guy were sooooo annoying. I'm so sorry but why do they have to be so critical before even trying the food?
MAYOWA OHHHHHH GOOOOOOOD🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️
It's the spoon for me
And only one of them picked a good major
If it does Not have broth its not ramen its noodles lol How i make mine. Water in pan add soy sauce seasoning package taste if its good enough add or boil out water as needed. Put ramen in boil for about a minute still underdone will finish as sitting in the boiling broth put in bowl top with a egg of your choosing i like shoju/soft boil with chives and corn. Take a bite of noodles and a sip of the broth same time yum
These ppl are uneducated af
The girl who got two was probably like  wat
Does that guy and the girl even know what ramen is supposed to look like?? Like tf.... I like my ramen dry. Wtf
I don’t really cook that often but i will chef up some noodles better than Gordon himself I wouldn’t even flinch
dude tell me why the other people tried to find anything wrong with cheyenne’s ramen because they didn’t wanna admit it was good. LMAOOO
Am I the only one who does ramen by itself or with Parmesan?
you don’t like the WATER??? NIGGA ITS SOUP WHAT DO YOU MEAN
funny cause my ramen would kick all their ramen's ass. but lowkey that 25c ramen is trash... pls stop eatin that their are SO many other instant ramens that are seriously so delicious
“I don’t like all the water” GURL WHAT- it’s a noodle SOUP. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
But isn't actual ramen supposed to have some "water" in it? Like soup
Y’all (except Cheyenne) don’t read instructions and it SHOWS. 💀
who tf eats ramen with a spoon
Why where the other two so meannnnnn  And BRO you sad that there's water yours was mushyyyyyy
They be hating on everything 😭😭😭 I like Cheyenne though
Bruh. I just add the ramen seasoning,chicken pieces,green onion,parsley,basil and thats it. Yall are trying so hard that you make it taste bad. I make shrimp ramen to yall, add anything ,beef is my favorite tho
Bruh I think the girl with the afro hair is taking it the wrong way like she think issa traditional meal and stuff with all those spices LIKE BRUH- ITS DANG RAMEN NOT JOLLOF RICE OR SUM.
Ramen: suppose to have soup Broke college kids: d r y r a m e n
Does anyone eat their ramen with spoons?? I always used a fork or chopsticks 😳
omg i was reading the comments thinking the noddles was going to be floating and there was barely even any water
ik olu watching this shit salty ashell
Someone gotta teach olu how to make ramen she said she was gonna win but lmao she didn't lmfao
Bruh, ramen? That is ramen? Bruh, where's the soup at? That thang look dryer than the wet clothes I hang out in a hot summer day
Cheyenne is so cute
It’s SaLTy like are you tryina KiLL ME
The sore crayon thessaly approve because nylon bizarrely shave regarding a maniacal snowplow. cowardly, hallowed tsunami
Everybody know all you need is the seasoning pack some garlic and sliced cheese
I don’t think some of them haven’t even had real ramen. The “water” as in soup is literally a part of it. Also it’s supposed to be cooked😳 She made “remen” not ramen😬
ah yes ramen no colour... does ramen normally come in green colour????
whats her name again?????
Olu and Marcus never eating Ramen before or what? Like how th hell do you eat dry ass ramen??? It literally says SOUP on the packaging, like even seasoning has soup on it written???? Cheyenne girl, she the only one who understood the concept of ramen
Nigerian style? Please, leave us alone. We do not know you /j
Eat maggi, its the best :)

Water ? that's soup bruh....

Producer : where did they go wrong 👀? Girl in black shirt : its everything for me 😶😅
Its Ramen, Its Suppose to have a soupy base 🤭. When I make Ramen, When the water is boiling, I add the powder then the noodles. The soup is the best part 😫
What the fuck 😂 why they acting like they some five star chefs ITS JUST RAMEN ADD THE SPICE PACKET THAT COMES WITH IT AND MOVE ON BABE
None of them know how to make noodles. Disgrace. I was making bom noodles in the 1st grade.
olu just stfu
and i thought i was mean 🧍
I *hate* dry ramen. My ramen has to have some water, especially since it’s salty sometimes.
godamn the title tho BROKE
the guy and cheetah print girl don’t even know what ramen is 💀
When the girl  said I like my Ramen more dry I said  we hair ball ramen
this is great acting lol & great scripting. 💯 bravo
I'm somehow offended by this video.
“My first instance is to smell it to know just to make sure im not eating anything bad” Your ramen is literally shit
Ok but like. I wouldve so won 🤣
They saying the winner's ramen is watery like, it's a soup you gotta add water and the other girl didn't even cook it, who are these people
Ramen is so nasty when its clumped up, you gotta break the long slabs apart or its gone club up and be nasty
re men
Olu pissed me off tf
The African Queen SWEAAR she had the best one too😂😂😂😂
That girl my Ramen my ramen my ramen
Bruh, eat pasta if you don’t like soup
How were they saying that the last one was too watery?? Its literally ramen, its supposed to have soup/broth. The second girl’s wasn’t even cooked right lmao.
afro girl was such a bitch oh my god
"It's watery" hunny then you would hate how me and my sister's make our ramen because it's all about the broth here. Clearly don't know what good ramen is ✋😌
One with the biggest talk usually is the worst ahha.
People who over hype their food always have the shittiest take.
1. YOU DO NOT EAT RAMEN WITH A SPOON.  2. I'm sorry but why isn't there an Asian in here  3. girl what the fuck is that- those dishes are not ramen-
all of em look dry 💀
I like butter pepper  lots of hot sauce and tuna
The bitch said ramin 🤣🤣
Cheetah Girl: it’s a little bit watery  Me: That’s called broth honey.

Lil miss Saltine talking about how hers actually has flavor

Ngl that cheetah girl was kinda rude no offense
LMFAO HE SAID "look its a lump" 😭😭😭

I know it’s most likely staged but it’s funny how mrs Afro was talking all this trash and got the worst score lmao.

The chettah girl really tried to tear people down and now she got ate up 😂😂😂 he really said this shit look dry as hell😭😭😭😭
Cheetah print girl gave everyone low ratings so she could get a chance at winning 🤣 wasn’t even close
How shorty say it was salty and then say its not seasoned 🤨
I just watched this to see the cocky cheetah print girl get exposed and it was worth it 😂
Why do they like dry Raman
omg the first girl goes to school in my city that's rlly cool
😂
The writers were like yeah make sure to mention that their broke
Based on these recipes, I wouldn't have considered any of them as "broke college students." Maybe poor, but definitely not broke.
Imagine them asking these guys to come on the show   “hey dude are you fucking poor?”
Everyone in here gon have beef after after this
"make your college struggle ramen" "its not enough shrimp" that's not adding up
"I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" oh so u want pasta 😂
i like how that one girl was just hyping up her ramen so much just for her to get a 2
Man they all wearing jewelry and rings how are they broke?
Cheetah girl: ew 🙄   Me: 👁👄👁
Ramen dry?! Sis that’s pasta... ramen is soup 🤦🏻‍♂️
They really think ramen is always dry like tf
I feel like I can make better ramen AS A MINOR lmao
The ramen is to watery-? these people man..
“Imma give it a 2 bc at least they tried” lmfaooo
They was right abt that water tho
dry ramen is 🤢🤢
ain’t none of them know how specific that texture gotta be lol
First of all why are they eating it with a spoon? Second of all am I the only one who has never seen ramen without broth? Why they eating dry ramen.
Lol African girl thought she had it
There’s not enough shrimp. Broke college Student: Exactly. I’m broke.
Olu girl no🤦‍♀️
"they were wrong by waking up " im dead

Oluwamayowa was so passionately disappointed in everyone's ramen but her's lol
WAteR that's broth ya know the stuff that gives ramen flavor.
omg a fellow MT major hell yeaa
Should I start college at 26? Today's my birthday and I'm lost as fuuuhhh
The second hand embarrassment 😖💀
Listen bro, ramen when it’s non boiled is literally heaven chips with packet flavors.
The Cheetah girl acting like Gordon Ramsay when she can't even differentiate stir fry noodles to Ramen which is a Japanese cuisine served with soup 💀
Lmaooo
Who else is from shakesauce
East Asians are crying rn...the tears probably could've added to the Ramen cuz why was all of it so dry?? Like no broth? You so broke you couldn't put no extra water.
Wait who tf says remen
Ramen is served in a liquid.
She said “my first instinct is to smell it, to make sure I’m not eating anything bad,” but home girl gave them uncooked ramen. Girl!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Cheetah girl: season the ramen!! also Cheetah girl: omg its so salty are you tryna kill me?!
Why y’all instant ramen looking like that 😭 good instant ramen doesn’t even cost that much bruh. Try Asian brands. AND THEY EAT IT DRY?? That only works with certain sauces bruh.
that one girl with the cheetah print is a big PICK ME talking about everybody else’s but hers look like that ?
Oluwamayowa: Ya my ramen is the best like its so good like ya ya im gonna win!  Just know theres a fine, FINE, line between confedence and just strait cockiness...
Ramen is supposed to be wet like have broth and stuff tf
Yea as an Asian I'm cringing so hard right now. They done put chicken and shrimp on their "instant noodle" and call themselves broke smh. Ya'll also forgot to put the word instant on your title, broth is the most important part of real ramen
You can look at her and tell I wouldn’t trust nothing she cook. She made them hard as noodles. I would eat the last bowl of noodles. I don’t want no crunchy noodles. They forget ramen noodles are kind of a soup. It’s supposed to be some juice in there
None of them look appetizing lmao
It’s funny how the one who gasses their stuff up the most gets the most unliked item 💀💀
I speak for all Nigerians when I say our noodles does NOT look like that and we definitely do not claim her
The girl in the cheetah was talking stuff but yet her’s was the nastiest.period
nothing makes sense from this video. Most ramen do have broth and they acting like the last ramen has mop water on it BUT they are eating DRY NOODLES with spoons... im deffo not vibing with this
Ramen is suppose to have liquid - it is a soup!! FOOLS
Did anyone notice they were eating with a spoon😋
Curly Haired Girl: “I prefer my ramen a lot more dry” GIRL WE KNOW
Yo it’s Ramen chill, legit was about to call the police..  “911, this bitch tryin to murder me with her nasty ramen”
Y are they all black ?
"Its salty are you trying to kill me?"                  Bitch you're eating fucking ramen packets mostly I don't think salt will kill you
“B R O K E !” - Sir billiam III
Spicy doesn’t mean flavor 😭🥱
She was talking all that smack
None of them know how to make ramen XD  spam and egg all day
I don’t like cheetah lady
Beef Ramen noodles with sour cream, is the best. I call it “poor man’s beef stroganoff”. Lol
Why are they complaining that the last one is "watery" like bruh, ramen is a type of noodle SOUP. The other two just made weird ethnic pasta lol
I love how the title says broke college kids but it’s shows only black kids!! instead of calling it that you should have just called it broke black college kids like ugh y’all don’t even notice the offensive stuff
How y’all not like water in your fuckin ramen it’s fuckin SOUP
0.09 Ain't that cultural appropriation?   You are as American as it gets.
Kdrama’s fans are leaving the chat 😔
Her ramen looks like buck wheat lmfao Get the guy from that jubilee vegan video here
Why do people eat these instant ramen without a fucking soup......like make it right.....ffs...
BITCH ITS RAMEN ITS SUPPOSED TO BE SOUPY
Olu is stunning but her attitude is not it
no ones gonna talk about how they gave them a spoon for ramen ?
Cheyenne>>> from her food to her attitude it was all good
i cant believe people are this picky i literally ate expired bread and didn’t realize until yk ITS FOOD IS FOOD
cheetah girl doesn’t pass the vibe check
0:09 sindaiyu
The African girl was being so fake. She knew their stuff was good but wanted to act like it was bad so she could boost herself
Who eats dry ramen😀as an Asian my ramen HAS to have liquid in it it has to have soup like what? Or at least make it moist and put sauce on it😭
“I prefer my ramen a little dry” yeah girl we can tell 💀
Why are they eating Ramen with a spoon?
that one girl should be in like a "curb your ramen" vid
Claim you I'm Nigerian ticket here 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
do they not know that ramen is supposed to have "water" which is like the soup?
"i prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" I-
Anyone else just say noodles and not ramen
Its so salty!! literally one minute later "theres no flavor"
It's funny how "broke" student can be this picky...
tbh i agree with the dry ramen part it makes it easier to grab with my hands when theres no soup
why was it chunks 🥲
are you tryna killl meee ??? 🤢🤢 sis stfu
the second girl 😭😭😭..
anyone else think their could been been chemistry between the girl who got 9.5 and the boy
These mfs puttin all fancy spices like bich I just use the sauce pack😍
Why does the cheetah girl act like she's in a school play?
What broke college kid has money for shrimp? In my school we were on some Campbell's Pork and Beans. Throw a few hot dogs in there, mustard, brown sugar, paprika and/or some BBQ sauce. Smelling like someone's Boston Baked Beans in the dorm.
It’s always the most confident ones that gets the lowest rating
first why are they eating with a spoon
anyone just put a shit tone of tobasco in your ramen like a lot
she said it was salty..... but then she said it has no flavor-
damn i could’ve been in this one 😭
I don’t no about y’all but the liquid part is supposed to have FLAVOR , it’s not just water .by the way any Hispanics in here that put Valentina in their ramen.
Bruh is it me or do all they ramen look nasty?
It’s fukn ramen lol not a 5 star meal it’s hard to make something that cost less than a dollar taste good
After looking at the comments about the Nigerian girl it’s so true like I don’t like how she tries to correct everyone noodles like hers is perfect...
Give them normal American noodles and you win
THE ONLY RAMEN WHO DIDN'T NEED WATER ARE INDOMIE GORENG HOW THESE PEOPLE EATING RAMEN WITHOUT SOUP?!!?!
That not ramen lol where's the broth? Where's the soup? There's none! The ramen that I eat have a rich broth and it got slices of pork, naruto( fish cake), and seaweed. Wtf is this shit! In my country where I was born this is not even ramen, we called this fried instant noodles. You put the instant noodles that you already boil it into the frying pan and then put some seasonings some vegetables, some soy sauce(optional), fried onion and done actually you don't even to re cook it, just put some seasoning and done
She tryna make her ramen look better than everyone else’s then when it comes round to it looks like crap 😂
Cheetah girl had the all the sauce except in her ramen. Kids, be humble.
I was definitely a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very broke student
My only concern is why are they using spoons??😂
I bet you used to cringe one that keeps on saying it's the_________for me
I feel like the girl with the curly hair is just trying to make sure she wins by saying everyones is bad
Cheetah girl saw Nigerian Ramen Noodles on a feed, and now acts like it's part of her personality, and she's been doing it for years..Vapid, is her existence
Girl- the cheetah girl be saying “it has no color” bish have u looked at urs-
Tbh the cheetah girl was annoying af, i just wanted to 🤜👩🏾
When they said why does it have water I mean... doesn’t ramen normally have water???
Uhhh she gotta humble herself 😭🤚🏼
Ramen is a godly food though
"Broke college student".. can afford chicken.. ok.. Bruvs Mie Goreng is all ye need.
I just wanna know why everybody is so damn rude. if ur asian, u cant talk shit abt anybody's food INFRONT OF THAT FOOD.
spoons ?
At least know the basics you're embarrassing yourself all my asians are cringing af
NOODLES ARE NOT PASTA
Naaaahhhhh they all looked like shit ngl.  Also lmaooo ramen is *supposed* to be soupy, so don't know why the other two were complaining about that. Without the soup, it's just pasta not ramen, like tf.
Ok but who Fr eats dry ramen?! If y’all do y’all physco to meee
why was there no water on theirs 😃 what-
They gave them fucking spoons for this?  Also, Cheyenne clearly knows what she's doing, it's all about that oyster sauce.
Yo that Nigerian girls ramen looked like the clumps of hair you’d find in the shower after your mom, girlfriend etc. was finished showering after a week
Get these dumbasses outta here with that spaghetti
The girl with curls was whack😂
"too much water" bro ramen is suooosed to have wwter
cheetah girl said "it has so much salt" maybe you ate too much salt bro u acting salty
Anybody that eats Ramen with a spoon. Your opinion is invalid.
Did you pay them so they’d have some money
"It's too salty" "it's not season" ya ok den
5:39 No need to explain yourself. We can truly tell 😐
i’ve literally never had ramen without broth before are they ok 💀💀
Those are ramen? Ramen supposed to have a broth right? Why am i seeing some dried ass noodles?
this vid legit pissed me off
Bruh am I the only one that literally just cooks the ramen with boiling water on a stove, drains some of the water and adds the flavor packet and thats it 🧍🏾‍♀️
yo gave them spoons to eat ramen...
I don't know if it's me but my ramen always has the soup in it like why were the first too so dryyy
I have never seen clumpy ramen 🥴🥴🥴🥴
These people are of color, and have different cultures, but are UNCULTURED, DISRESPECTFUL, and just outright stupid.
Seem so fake like actors
I’m Japanese and this offends me when people call that crap ramen. Ramen has SOUP or BROTH. THAT IS DRAINED OF ALL OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THERE TO MAKE IT RAMEN. THOSE ARE JUST THE NOODLES THAT IS CALLED RAMEN NOODLES. NOT RAMEN!! You do not drain the boiling water from the pot. You put your seasoning into the bowl you are eating it with, and put the boiled water, and ramen noodles in there, then eat it. I feel like american people think that, THAT is what ramen is, and it really isn’t. I’m sorry but what you’ve been eating this whole time is the ramen noodles. Not real ramen.
who gave the cheetah girl confidence
“I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” We know miss clumps 😭
That black girl is so annoying
Why they all so annoying

Bruh only one ramen was actually ramen lmao its soup!!! how y'all mess that up???
Bruh these weak lime with valentina is unbeatable
There’s always that one person who thinks they better than everyone else in this type of videos 💀 and end up having the worst  ratings

I now have beef with the cheetah print girl
why all of these ramen are not "broke"🙄
WTH RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WATERY ISTG

“i like my ramen dry” yea we could tell your ramen as in chunks
I make mine like egg drop sooo then a slice of Kraft cheese on top
“oh my god it’s so salty...” literally 5 seconds later “the only thing that has flavor in this meal is the chicken..”  wait what.
"rAhMeN"
Where are these people even broke Oh right student loans
You just need a good air fryer for a college student
"I don't like all the water" umm.. but Japanese ramen is a soup based dish..? I can't tell if he meant its literally flavorless water in the bowl, or if he just prefers dry noodles with no soup stock.
now did this girl just say her mom is Spanish. that’s not a thing 🤦🏽‍♀️.
love how this pops up while i’m eating ramen
i just put hot sauce in mine-
1 is the best person here and 3 is the worst 1. Cheyenne (girl in braid) 2. The guy 3. Olu (the annoying Afro girl)
The girl who won was the only one that looked good💀

thst girl was acting so entitled and no one liked her ramen😭
i’m not a fan of the girl with the afro but y’all need to realize salty does not mean it’s flavored. it can be flavorless & dry still.

Olu: My ramen is gonna win! Marcus trying her ramen: This shit dry as hell 🤣
girl was hating when her stuff was CLUMPY
I know cheetah girl didn’t just say it’s too salty😐
Why they got spoons like?
At the beginning why did I think he was reacting to them trying it? I realized when he kept smiling
Tell me why the ppl that hate the most got the worst food🤔
Haa that Nigerian girl disappoint me sha. Please not all Nigerians act like that.

The girl was talking the most shit about everyone else ramen but nobody liked hers
"look it's a crump" -Marcus
where is the broth? the hell.
“the ramen is too watery” it’s supposed to be😐 the broth is kinda what makes or breaks it. the other twos ‘ramen’ was dry as fuck
why is it always the ones who talk the most shit who get the lowest ratings
“my mom is spanish” ?????
“My first instinct is just to smell it and make sure I’m not eating anything bad”. Hers want even good lmao
WHY IS IT SPicY

Chicken ramen with franks hot sauce and garlic powder. That’s all for me
How long did it take before they could give the ramen out its stuck not soupy
who eats dry ramen?????
💀 this was funny to me 😢
Do these people not know what ramen is supposed to look/taste like? The winner definitely won by a landslide. Sheesh.
How can you be so picky about instant ramen
Wait so do these mfs throw away the water when they make the ramen and it’s cooked already?? Do they not add the little spice packet
why are they eating it with a spoon
having soup is the main thing smh. dumb asses
'broke'
Olu is pissing me off
I- how do you mess up ramen-?
“I think mine is really good”   “this shit dry as hell”💀🤚🏾
So do no one eat ramen with soup 😳😳😳 because that’s how I like it
Do african americans not eat ramen as soup?
there’s always that one super entitled person that pissed me off.
BEST RAMEN:     Ramen that’s hot they taking to long eat it LOL
Olu thinks she is so African when she's not. I hate people when they are like that. I'm more African than she is (I was literally born Africa.)
So are we just not going to talk about how they're using spoons for ramen...... wtf
Is no one gonna talk about that girls name
Why are they all black
literally ramen is soup and noodle/ what are they talking about-
6:19 "it has no color" WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE....PINK AND PURPLE?!?

Girl really just said “there’s no color” ...Like what were you expecting? It’s literally ramen—😀
Bro that one girl who is dramatic : 2:06   are you trying trying kill me...😭 and then that nice girl comes in  omg this is so good...O.O  : 2:08

The poofy hair one makes me mad

I love how he just like ✨🍞Dis crumbs or something✨🍞
They all looked horrible
the girl with the hairpuff says there ramen is nasty and hers has "flavor" when her ramen got rated the worst
ahahahahha the only one that was nice was the camera man
Its always the ones that have the most things to say that's food is bad
"edible"

This literally missed me off y'all r amen is SUPPOSED t o have water :/
Neuroscience major here🙈
It’s not water, ITS SOUP.
WTH is this, they don't even know what ramen is Imao. Ramen is soup not stir fry noodles people.
The girl in the cheetah print shirt was just a hater. Even though she won the girl in the black shirt didn’t deserve a 3/10.
Cheetah girl be like “I like my ramen to be a bit drier” *other 2 holding up a brick that she claims to be ramen* yeah sis we know
I fry my noodles lol sweet chili sauce , green onions and sesame seeds 😁 graduating next fall 💕🤘🏼
We ain’t gonna talk about how pretty the girl with the puffy hair is- wow.
the pickiest chick had the worst ramen, ironic 🤣🤣
ok but why they eating it with a spoon?
wow all black and and calling them broke peep that racism
Everyone’s gassing on these people for the way they eat ramen💀💀Chilllll everyones different
"I don't like the water, its watery"  *it being ramen, a soup*
The leopard with the afro only cares about how something looks rather than how it tastes and the mop with the glasses thinks he knows everything
olu had too much confidence
Lmaoo they couldn’t even eat cheetah girls ramen meanwhile she talk so much
Wait, why does it sound like they have eaten dry ass ramen their entire life?... wait have i been eating Ramen the wrong way?
I came from shake sauce
If girl says vibe one more time I swear
I love the water in ramen i drink it cuz i add a shit tona black pepper n make it "flavorful" 😂
gordon watching this: IT'S DRY
I feel like they are getting confused with 2 minute noodles and ramen which is a soup
Ramen is supposed to have soup water🍜
Need more diversity get a Caucasian Hispanic and an Asian in there diversity is 🔑
2:38 Not her thinking she was going to win. 🤣🤣🤣
The Afro girl is sooooo full of herself and soooo sassy  Like if u aggre    👇
People don’t understand what broth is
“I prefer my noodles a little dry” no girl you like them straight out of the pack😂😂😂😂
Olu literally said its not good foe the first broke college students dont bitch about their food
the girl in the cheetah print shirt is sooo annoying
The ramen doesn't have color🙄 bruh its ramen what is it supposed to be blue
“Isn’t it funny how you have to pick between an education and proper food??? Haha how quirky”😪
Can we discuss how they are eating ramen with a spoooooonnnnnnn
The girl in the Cheetah shirt had it dry asl and half cooked
Chey nailed it and understands what ramen actually is. And why tf are they all eating ramen with a spoon lmao
“i would prefer my ramen a little more.... dry” bro i lost it😂😂😂😂😂
The cheetah girl wanted to be the main character on god 😭
I don’t know why I’m watching this but it’s funny and interesting 😭💕
Cheyenne's BY FAR looks the best! But tbh my ramen would have won.. 😏
Thats why they shit be flavorless they dump that shit out with the water frfr
These kids need to stop, get help and follow the instructions.
My ramen step by step  Boil water  put ramen brick and flavoring in a bowl  Pour water over ramen and flavoring,  Eat it slightly underdone  rinse and repeat
Ion really like the title
Its always the person that talks alot loses
First girl: has owa in her name Me: can I get a *o w a o w a.*
I prefer less water like dry I like my Roman dry
ramen is not stir fry yall....
“Is that hay”..... booooiiiiii I died
oh my god the girl in the cheetah print is so annoying oh my god
The public bank phylogenetically pat because dibble thankfully pump throughout a understood bicycle. petite, axiomatic acknowledgment
My brother dont eat his with water and call me weird.     😒😒      But im fine😢✌🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜
Indomie is the only instant ramen worth eating
Lol... what happened to the use to be broke part mentality? Need to squeeze, so one shrimp for you! This ain’t Opra! Lol xo but funny
Lmfao cheetah person on crack
" i don't like how there's so much water in it" LMFAOOO WHATTT THATS LITERALLY WHAT RAMEN ISS NOODLES WITH BROTH.
Complains about the saltiness, also has no flavor, then loses horrendously
lol my ramen is beef and chicken top ramen mixed together lmao and no offense but i'm pretty sure it's better than all of theirs because it actually has the broth i know it sound mean but it's probably true lol sorry
olu hype herself so much it back fired🥲😂
The girl that said are you gonna kill me just killed marcus with her clumpy noodles.
we get your Nigerian  you have a lot of seasoning
6:39 brooo what is ata goon bruh🤣🤣🤣
Wow
I was like 🤨😡🤬 when the cheetah and guy were trashing the other girl’s ramen and then when they said it was “kinda good” I was like 🔫😑 best bet🙂
For olu what kinda color she wants it to be 😂
IT hAs WaTeR iN iT well no shit Sherlock it’s ramen
Y’all when you leave the water in the noodles THE SEASONING GOES IN THE WATER IDIOTS that’s why it didn’t have any color CUZ YOU GOTTA DRINK THE WATER TOO SO YOU CAN TASTE THE FLAVOR
Damn the basic ramen has evolved to this lol.   And ramen has a soup base yo! So ye it's gna be soupy lol
It’s the people who are way to confident in theirs that end up getting the worst scores ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Wow I can’t even fathom how broke I was” YAAAS
I DONT CLAIM MY NIGERIAN SISTER
Is there a perfect way to make noodles????
Cheetah girl mad annoying
Why the caption “broke college students”
This is so funny
Nigerians actually annoy me
I just ate my noodles with eggs and siracha. N if I had some extra cash, I’d put in some meat and green onions. Shyt taste fire.
Basically no one likes each others ramen.
XD      Bro this is funny bruh he said "this ramen look dry as hell look it's a clump XD wait I that a hair? No no I'm jk could you imagine."shut down the studiooo"
Girl goes, it’s too salty, then immediately says there’s no flavor, like what?
first thing that should jump into anyone's mind is that BROKE STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD SHRIMP!!!!!
Why she gotta roll her eyes like that😭😭😭
Olu really annoys me...I can’t stand her attitude and she is trying really really hard to be interesting.
i thought you keep the soup water in????!!!
you gotta make the ramen different
Wdym "Kids"
This bitch really said “to make sure I’m not eating anything bad” like what😂😂🤣😭
If there was nothing else I have learned, its that my people can't read labels...AT ALL! LOL.  As stated by our enlightened, beautiful brothers and sisters: "Ramen is a SOUP!"  The package literally says "NOODLE SOUP". (Like Naruto and Goku be eating. lol)  But best believe, I love my people until the day I die. <3
if i was there i would get aa pack of chicken ramen ;) (ಥ _ ಥ)
*This gonna be me coming into college as a freshmen this fall 2021 learning about the famous ramen coming into college broke* 😂😂😂
Broke college kids try ramen noodles notice how there all black
They don't seem broke at all lol 😂
I would eat the last one bcs that looks like real ramen man
does anyone in this video have a braincell?
Lol I wanna see the girl in the cheetah shirts reaction to her having the least amount of points 😆
"i like my noodle dry" bruh u like yours half cooked lol
You're not that broke if you can add shrimp or crayfish to your ramen. Ramen is 15-20 cents a piece. Those other items aren't super expensive, but if you eat this regularly, it will add up.
How could they how could they use spoon to eat ramen
I don't like any of these people. They're all so full of themselves 🙄
Cheetah girl really thought she did sum💀🤚🏻
"This Ramen (soup) is too watery" Best quote of 2021
Cheetah girl is like that girl from the 1k dollars who wanted it for an aquarium
Why does the worst cooks always got the biggest mouths lmaooooo
“I prefer my ramen more dry” yeah I can tell
WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON YOU EAT IT WITH A FORK OR CHOPSTICKS
She keeps mentioning "Ahh not enough ATATAGOON" Like anybody knows what tf that even is.
The girl with the cheetah print shirt  is VERY ... wahts the word?                Over confident
Okay but are those ramen y'all? :/
Fake if you are really broke in college they you know why they forgot to mention this let me know if you know what it is
The cheerah girl is soooo annoying
The third ramen was the best they talk too much
pov: ur reading all these annoying comments on how they liked there ramen dry..... 😳😳🙄🙄
It’s always that one girl 🤦🏾‍♀️
Raaamen  watery wat do yu meaaAANN I'm CONFUSION losing brein CELSS 💀
Naaaah they need Sazon added in that ramen!
not them saying BROKE college student and then the guy complaining about not enough shrimp being in the girls ramen what-
Tf she talking abt color for
The second girl cooked it for too long and it mushy and dry
Excuse me but who taught those two how to make "ramen"?
How can you be picky with instant ramen sometimes simple is better
what spanish her mom hold up.?
LMFAO RAMEN IS SOUPPPPPPPPPPPPP.
Where the fuck the egg and vegies at why the fuck there no broth that shit yakisoba? That shits not fucking korean ramyan
“there’s not enough shrimp” says the “BROKE” college student  i mean beggers can’t be choosers man
Bro. Water, 1 egg and frozen veggies. It’s not hard or expensive to make these edible LOL
Curly hair girl obviously just doesn’t eat ramen she doesn’t even know what she’s talking about.
Please because all of it look dry, where’s the broth?!😩
This is what I call ✨ quality content ✨
“I prefer my ramen a little dry” meanwhile her ramen isn’t even cooked all the way
A T A    G U N G U N
I don't see how people eat dry noodles🤣🤣
Why didn’t they show their reactions to their scores? That cheetah print girl needed to know hers sucked and to stop acting like she knows best
these kids ignorant
From what i know the ramen they usually used supposed to be a soup dish . Im really curious why half of the people i saw cook them dried . DRIED RAMEN IS CALLED FRIED NOODLE/RAMEN . 🤧
No Nongshim to be found
“Its like regular pasta” No. It isn’t.
Shrimp. and broke doesn’t go in the same sentence
ISNT RAMEN SUPPOSED TO BE SOUP????
Im here after Shakesauce
Looks like ramen to me
“it has water in it” yeah? no way
why is she so obsessed with seasoning it
this cheetah girl disappointed me 😭😭😭,,nigerians dont cook noodles like that
Being a broke college student is whack A F! and we have REMEN to save the day
“There’s not enough shrimp” um sir i don’t think broke college students can afford to add a whole bag of shrimp to their meals
Tell me how do you define ramen. At this point i'm wondering if we are actually imagine the same thing when mention "ramen"
"the ramen is a bit watery" GURL U ARE LITTERALLY EATING UNCOOKED NO CARBS HARD NOODLES
They eatin ramen with spoons
It’s sad how no one realized the titled
Tf kinda ramen yall be eating...😰
0:08 I tried to pronounce her name... And now my furniture's floating ight wtf
the way you guys triggered at the cheetah girl, i can't-
*Maggie left the chat*
Ramen SHOULD have water😭🤚 it’s literally instant chicken noodle soup. Plsssss
Who’s here from shakesauace
I find it sad that so many people struggle with uni because they have no money. Capitalism is bullshit
i add chilli  powder to mine or just hot sauce
LOL YALL EAT RAMEN WITH NO SOUP ?!!! bruh im disgusted
why am I getting pissed off at the fact that they're using a spoon to eat the ramen
Cheetah girl : I like my ramen a lil dry . The guy : to much water : me well no fucking shitt
2:25 dude that eye opening and looking down pissed me off and I don’t even know why. I’m not that bothered by her talking crap about his food, it’s just that look made me angry as hell.
do they know what ramen is?? lol it's supposed to be in a broth
Do you ever just wanna 👩🏽‍🦱🤛🏽
They're eating ramen with a spoon...
How do u apply to one of these 😂 I got the new news aka noodles  down packed
The cheetah lady kept on saying rehmen
"it has water." I– is it not supposed to??
Bro, literally you could get some bowl chicken noodle ramen and microwave it then put the packet seasoning, I’d bet it looks and tastes better than all theirs lol
Real question tho why are some of them eating ramen with a spoon???
“too watery” gurl its literally RAMEN- LIKE HUNNY SIT DOWN
I don’t trust people that drain there ramen
Not everyone calling Olu "Cheetah Girl" 😩😩😭😭
"Theres not enough shrimp" bro this video is about being broke
Ramen noodle (indomie brand is our ramen, originally it is a Indonesian brand but it’s really popular in Nigeria they have adapted it to the country ) . Yes it’s usually mostly eaten without broth, so yes dry but not too dry because usually oil is used. It is also sold as a a street food usually at night and it is such a delicious street food. I have never heard of cray fish added into it 🤔 I won’t have done that if I were to be her , cray fish i feel can be probably too strong for someone that is not used to it . But I guess everyone has their own style . So I feel she didn’t represent Nigeria welll with that ramen but she represented well with her beauty and style .
I can’t how the 3rd girl say her ramen is everything and blah blah and she gets a 2 💀
Ewwww nastyyyyy eating the ramen without Cooking it
why were they complaining abt the broth? like most actual resteraunts serve it w broth, and I keep mine in when I make it, like??? did they not know??
They did not have to call them broke in front of 2mill+ ppl y’all wrong for that 💀😭😭
y'all we do not claim that nigerian girl she really embarrassed us all
there is no way their eating ramen with a spoon
The Asian in me is crying
Imma win this shit. Coz im pro at being broke and im a pro at instant ramen making
"it looks kinda dead.." ITS RAMEN- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE??
I HATE HER      yall know who I'm talking about 😭
*Atatagoon*
yall havent hit the broke college student creativity yet 😭🤣 I wanna see this challenge again with other people from different states with more ramen noodles diversity 💀💀
If you being picky with what you eat, you aint broke at all man
EATING RAMEN WITH SPOON!!!
The Cheetah girl was kinda annoying. She was putting everyone down but nobody liked her 😂
She said I like my ramen a “little” more dry 😂 okay sis
ramens supposed to have soup in it bruh..
They scream snobby rich kid more than broke college student. Doesn't even know there is water in ramen and pretending they are gordon ramsey or something saying the food has no color. If you broke you make do with what you got and if it tastes good then it's all good.
Ok everyone’s criticising the people but no ones bringing up the fact they’re eating noodles with a FUCKING SPOON
They all look bad😂😂
She said its salty. And then said it has no taste😂
my question is, why are they using a spoon-
It’s more sad that they are using spoons to eat they don’t know how to make ramen take a cup of instant ramen put hot water until the line then wait a few minutes the last one at least knows how to make some ramen
my favorite thing abt this vid is that cheetah girl lost
nobody gonna talk about how they're using spoons to eat noodles
Why that bitch so uppity
Bro she was like imma put some ATATAGOOM On This
She really said my mom is Spanish 😐
Me trying to say oluwamayowa name the whole vid
You guys will notice a pattern. Everytime, the worst critic loses miserably and the relatively nice one wins.  P.S. two of them really dont know what ramen is, do they?
Yeah. They’re contestants all right, but they definitely ain’t judges
how can you be picky and Broke?😂
bro they dragged each other through the MUD
asians losing their heads
do these people know how to make ramen WHERE'S THE SOUP...
I had a feeling they was all gonna be black🤦🏾‍♀️
Just realized that this isn’t buzzfeed
flexing and got a 2
Topic is ramen, but doesn't bring in a SINGLE Asian person
Cheetah girl talking smack and looses
Jesus they’re so good at picking hateable people.
water wtf you mean broth?????
Is it normal to eat ramen with a spoon??
The cheetah girl is weird ✋😭 I hate her bye!!!
The dude most definitely shoulda won but I stg I woulda beat them all.
Cheyenne is the only one who made ramen
Always the rude ones losing 🤔
girly was bringing each ramen she tried down thinking hers was gon be good 💀
5:36 yes we know u do lmao
They broke with Shrimp and Chicken?
As an asian I hate any of y’all who eat ur ramen dry and crunchy like this with idk what u put in that shit and called it good fucking ugh y’all taste buds messed up, like contestant number two said where’s the seasoning even though her and the dudes ramen looked no different from each other’s
Girl chill, you cooking ramen for a youtube video. You ain't on master chef 💀
Do these people know that real restaurant style ramen is a SOUP DISH?! They are in COLLEGE!!
I’ve always wondered something. Before instant ramen, what did college students eat?
ray-man?!?!?!? may-rue-chan?!?!?! i cant they really in college?
BRO WDYM YOU DONT LIKE THE WATER— ITS B R O T H. ITS LIKE THE THING THAT FILLS YOU UP IF THE RAMEN DONT- oml- I cant
why the fuck did they give them spoons
Cheetah girl is so preetyyyy
why did none of them have broth
yall i know we can do better than this lolol we all broke college students but pls someone help them
shawty in the cheetah print buggin.
Shrimp aint cheap..
The able flute undesirably kiss because sneeze singly x-ray alongside a discreet beard. black-and-white, damaging duck
what are they doing with that spoon???
She said she preferred her ramen dry which explains why hers looked like a dried up Desert😭😭😭
My question is why they eating noodles with spoons 😭😭😭
WHAT THE HELL YOU CALL THAT A RAMEN 😂😂😂
*“It’s pretty watery.” “ITS CALLED A BROTH! ITS THE 2ND MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE RAMEN!”*
I like that the only person who wasn’t talking mad trash won 😂 the guy and the girl in the cheetah print were so negative when their ramen was gross. Also I was SHOOK when I saw there was no broth in any of these. Ramen is a soup! You had to make those noods somehow, use that liquid to help you out 😂 as a broke collage student I want the broth to help fill me up since I can’t afford anything else
NAH OLU PISS ME OFFFF
Onomatopoeia or whatever her name is had the worst noodles but talked about everyone else's noodles like what
“The ramen is a bit watery...” What do you think this is chile? Da hood?
Here i am putting an egg in mine
Damn the best ramen is with nothin added lmao
do they know ramen traditionally has broth LMAO
Lmfao who the hell eats dry noodles
WHY DOES IT ALL LOOK SO DRY
Me who just uses water and have a foodgasm over it
Try this:  1.Ramen (Udon noodles if you can afford them)...thank me later. I like some soup with mine so i keep some of the water. 2. 1/2 the included seasoning pack 3. A bit of Soy sauce  4. Ginger POWDER (not too much) 5.  Honey/ sugar (not too much) 6. chicken or meat of choice(& a soft boiled egg if you want) 7. Sriracha for a kick Each of these items can be found for under $2 -$3 and last pretty long. This is just a quick mix. (Adjust to your liking of course) Not too boring. Not too extra. Lol like this comment if you agree.
bro olu so fucking annoying
Y’all make ramen like plain just make ramen with the spicy soup chicken flavored one😂
the Nigerian girl was wayyyyy too cocky lmao, ms girl rlly thought hers was amazing- i-
The fact that You don’t like water in your soup. If it isn’t water it ain’t ramen.
And they all ⚫
Bud making everyone else ramen look bad when hers was the worst I’m dead 💀
Is it just me or do y’all have juice in your ramen! It’s litterally soup it’s supposed to have juice and water
This isn’t ramen. Ramen has broth. At the very least this is yakisoba.
All they ramen was trash
Nah violatin wit da title tho
Bro who likes dry ramen🤮
Why they eating with a spoon doe
Who's here from ShakeSauces video???
her ramen looked like it wasnt cooked lol..
why are they complaining about the water ramen is literally soup
I dont think cheyenne knows that shes black
How is this "broke ramen" if they are putting a bunch of different exspensive ingredients in it. I feel like we have two different ideas of what broke is
I knew the Connecticut girl was gonna win from the start
Why cheetah so toxic
The best struggle ramen meal is the seasoning packet mixed with Sirracha and peanut butter, sounds gross tastes like Patai
6:16 WhY TF does the Color Matter 😑 it’s a 1 dollar meal of GMO Goodness.
when they were saying it was too watery I was just thinking like, "have they never seen ramen in japan or other asian countries?" or even in new york lol. it's SOUP.
the girl wit da big hair said they are too salty and then goes on to say season the noodles
Ummm.. what or how did she even mess up those noodles for them to be in chunks 🥴
Bro it's ramen..... I wanna slap someone sorry
Am I the only one that concerned that they’re eating RAMEN with a SPOON
me watching the video:      nobody:     Olu: eats ramen with a literal spoon
The fact that they were freaking out about the last one having *SOUP* in it, PROVES THAT THEY PROLLY NEVER TRIED REAL RAMEN BEFORE!!!
She really said my name is  OmAe Wa MoU😭
I’m way younger than them and I can make ramen better            ;-;
It’s always the ones who talk their food up who do the worst 😭😭
that cheetah girl is annoying af
wait i always add water, yall eat dry fricking ramen?
Marcus is giving me the Jimmy neutron friend vibe. Carl
"I prefer mine dry" yah, we know 😂😂🙄
oh god Twitter users have invaded the comments
BYE " BROKE COLLEGE KIDS"
“Too watery” TF do you mean?  THAT’S WHAT RAMEN IS. NOODLES AND SOUP Bruh I’m done with these people
They eatin ramen wit a spoon I’m outta here 🤦🏾‍♂️
the girl with the black shirt made ramen the right way in my opinion. i hate it when ramen is dry
you want dry noodles eat lo mein lmao
you do realize that ramen is made with broth right?... it's supposed to be "watery" and that's how it was originally made, and still how it's made in Asian countries
The way Marcus talks and the way he styles his hair and clothes   My boi dead built like dark mode Carl wheezer 😭
Bringing ramen from home will always go left. Surely 😩😂. Dry.
The cheetah shirt girl really want color to ramen but hers doesn’t have any color to its dry and looks disgusting
"I mean it does have it but it's kinda dead". I'm done
I didn’t like cheetah girl at all she’s the type of person who thinks she knows everything and is good at everything
as a vegan i’m very glad top ramen has chili ramen because i can’t have like any other to  ramen
THE AFRO IS PISSING ME OFF, "mines gonna win" tf nah ts dry asl
"The ramens a bit watery" "I don't like the water" Excuse me do you not eat the ramen with the soup? Do you just eat it dry because the soup is what gives it flavor-
the girl with the Afro is literally the phrase "I’m different”
Cheetah ur picky and lost😩😹
Watching this video literally makes Gordon Ramsey sound like the nicest guy ever
Lmao
“ remen ”?????😂😂😭
I’m surprised none of em brought dry ramen with the salt flavor pack it comes with. You dip them noodles in the salt - you save money on water and it’s pretty ok 😂 “I don’t like the water” HERES YOUR SOLUTION
Is this a video on college students try each other’s Ramen or a video about being very picky
I'm not broke or in college but I love ramen and noodles  P.s my family calls me the ramen / noodle / spaghetti / pasta expert I'm in school  6 the grade to be exact  And I promise I'm not lying
1:04  " are you going to finish... that cwõssiąnt"           Some people will get it some people will not 😔☝️
I love how the girl who was like “mine is ✨exotic✨ and amazing” got two points 😂
Everyone was so annoying except the girl in the black shirt.
bruh its instant ramen how fucking hard is it tho
Olu: I would just add more color. Oh and it’s too watery  Me: WHAT KIND OF NOODLES NEED COLORING FOR IT TO BE FRICKING GOOD?! I I LOVE TO HAVE WATER IN MY NOODLES- Olu got the place she deserved those noodles looked hecka dry 😭✋🏼
It’s the point of being broke 😂 shrimp here too expensive
That first chick annoying as fuck holy shit
Bro the guy sounds like FaZe Rug honestly
PLEASE- ITS SOUP. SOUP.
All of their ramen looks nasty-
i- why yall got no broth
the girl with the afro thought she was all that and was making fun of the other ramen but yet hers looked so discusting
These fools judging like they’re on kitchen nightmares or some shit
If y’all like spaghetti this isn’t spaghetti why does your ramen not have water in it? Y’all food dry or something
.... i just hot sauce in mine... sometimes an egg
ok but like what if they were talking off set and described the ramen and then that person would be like " yo that's my ramen" and it would be awkward as hell or like they would start fighting ( which I'm 100% here for ) and then they'd be like " you talikin shit about my ramen?" " we throwing hands". hahahahaha like just imagine.
There not broke they just gotta wait till mommy and daddy send money
they never ate real ramen
WHERES THE SOUP PART?
Ramen pose to have some water in it!!
who tf doesn't put water in their ramen
as a nigerian can i say we dont claim the cheetah girl please it is ramen not egusi soup
Y’all the audacity 🤣. WHERE IS THE SOUP
I like water in ramen but the water in that packaged ramen tastes bad and it gets soo salty with water.
Why are only blacks in this video?!?!
Aint ramen supposed to have sou- okay👩🏼‍🦯
None these people know how to cook good ramen...😝
For all of the college kids trying to make a good broke ramen, simply add a raw egg yolk into the noodles then sprinkle the seasoning on. Green onions, and bam
lmao Cheyenne truly was the queen of ramen the others were just so salty their ramen couldn't even COMPETE like----- they also be forgetting this is supposed to be not that great it's literally ramen on a budget :/ stop making excuses babe you're only embarrassing yourself at this point. CAN I BRING MY RAMEN NEXT IT'S RLLY GOOD I SWEAR LMFAOOO
“This has water in it, I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” like yeah I think we can tell by those dry chunks that were in ur ramen
who else screamed when she said "i donT LiKe ThE watEr" like?? its RAMEN
the cheetah girl pisses me off for no reason
it’s always the ones with the biggest egos and attitudes that get the lowest score
Bruh my ramen is the best
The fact afro girl she called the boys dry and hers be dryer- Like lmfao tbh I wouldnt eat any of them and bruh Ramen is ment to be wet wtf these people are aliens if they eat their Ramen dry11
*rummen*
Idgaf all them can’t can’t cook😂 they mad talking down on each other but all of em look nasty

These people are doing so many things wrong   dry ramen one of them is eating ramen with a spoon you should use chop sticks or the 2nd best a fork why are these guys so picky? they dont like ramen and soup the only person who put soup in their ramen made the soup shallow like the personality of the people on the video most of the people are just putting the others down just to win dont look at the ramen and smell it like stuff to rate it just eat it "The ramen has no color"  girl you tryna put food coloring in it? One person said it was too salty then said the chicken only has flavor is salty not a flavor?

Im sorry but the girl with the afro was really getting on my nerves lmaoo
That girl is sure of herself

Ramen is supposed to have water in it like bruh you need to water in it to cook it and if you don't have water in it then it not even ramen
The tiger dress girl is picky and i don’t like how she acts because it’s like she  is rich and she’s spoiled
Someone teach them to make ramen I feel like throwing up after seeing these "ramen"
Wtf u talking bout “watery” bruh ITS RAMEN. RAMEN IS SOUP WITH NOODLES. YAL DUMB IM MAD AT THIS DAMN

these dumbasses want a ramen soup without the soup and this guy stoopid i dont like the soup in soup ramen.
She really said it was too salty no Duh Ramen is salty and then she gonna say  mines definitely going to win🙄PLS
Random spicy and a lot of seasoning doesn’t make it good...
CHEYENNE IS SO FUNNY PLSSS
The afro girl was like it`s so dry, Minutes later her own ramen was more dry than his were. She don`t know what she talking about.
5:45 bro- its called ✨soup✨ a special reason why we have the instant powder
"i prefer my ramen a little more dry" yeah we know
I’m on the toilet
These people all putting down each other’s ramen when in reality they’re all bad at cooking.... how do you mess up ramen...💀
They don’t put water in their ramen, because they spend their money on disgusting seasoning so at the end its just a dry, salty, piece of junk with tons of sodium already and say ‘’ I Don’T LiKE ThE wAteR iN It,,
Don’t you just want to try this yourself? Everybody was so excited about there own recipe but they still got a 2
Why is nobody talking about the fact that they use spoons?! Just me?
Im not trying to be rude but like...... *starts beeing rude*
How u *fuck*  up noodles  ITS *FUCKING* NOODLES
I'd knew right away that Olu's ramen is going to be the worse. It's almost always the ones who are overly confident or critical that always turn out to be worse out of the group, lol.
I’m sorry but RAMEN IS A SOUP YALL 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ IT LITERALLY SAYS ON THE PACKAGE
3:10 😂

Too much WATER?! What? Lmao Uh, real ramen has way more than what they had in that bowl. 🥴 Uncultured.
are they paying them to say only mean things abt each others ramen-
Bruh this girl is bi-polar first she says "Its to salty" then she says "season the ramen"
I only see 1 bowl of ramen. There is no soup in the other ones lmao.
The girl with the cheetah print long sleeve hella annoying
I don’t get why people are eating the noodles on there own because it’s supposed to be a soup with noodles that’s what ramen is not noodles in a bowl.
Why is all the ramen dry af  edit: except for that 3rd one
i hated the boy
Can we have an Asian rate this lmao just curious because last time I ate ramen it was supposed to have Broth in it 🤔
My ramennis just the packet seasoning water and hit sauce lol
Why does the 1st and 2nd look UNCOOKED like how do you mess up ramen? The 3rd one actually looks and sounds AMAZING. Tbh, ya'll need to find better people to put in your videos.
Why is this ramen look so dry pls next do with lot of water
I would drain the water, add the packet, then add a slice of American cheese.  Its so bomb!
Why are they eating ramen with spoons though?
Ramen Lives Matter the RLM movement
all of them:literally fixes a pack of instant ramen  The Nigeria woman: This looks like mine...?
The girl in cheetah print omg bad vibes 😭🤚🏾
I’m Japanese      Why would you do this to ramen
It’s always the one talking the most shit that got the worst food. Every time I watch these type of videos, it’s the same thing
Am i the only one who doesnt like the girl with the afro
Why would you serve ramen with a spoon. Wtf
Not the fact that the “broke college kids” isn’t with more than just African Americans in the video
What the fuck are they eating
You can't be broke and be so picky lol
The water is supposed to be there it has all the flavor it’s a flipping soup what are you saying, even traditional ramen has the soup, refrererrerererrere
2:23 RaMeN LiVeS mAtTeR 🍜✊
The way they laughed at the second one 😭😭
I’m actually happy that that girl who had like chunks in her soup like lost cause she was so rag and she was like oh my thing is the exotic my thing is so good when you’re really wasn’t like it had chunks
WHY ARE THEY COMPLAINING ABOUT THD SOUP?!?! IF YOU EAT COMPLETELY DRY NOODLES GET AWAY FROM MEEE
how are these people broke and still putting chicken and shrimp in their ramen? fam if you have money for chicken and shrimp, then eat something better than ramen 😭 if I'm lucky I'll add lemon juice to mine and call it a day
I can't cringe any harder
Do these people eat boiled noodles or what because as a person who has been to Japan and has tried Ramen from there , I am telling you these people have no taste and I get that they were broke in collage and times were tough and etcbut seriously, have yall never tried actual Ramen before because the way they are rating it look slide there friends cooked them some noodles at a play date and that was the only time they ate "ramen" and they decided to make it on there own and the person that said " its too watery ", bruh that is the whole point of Ramen like have you seen restaurants Ramen, they have a lot more than a spoon full of water   Like jeez
RAMENS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH
*_"They went wrong when they decided to cook."_*   LOLLLLLLLL
I love the fact that she was way too confident and she was kind of like toxic and stuff and thought she was the best cook but when it came down to HER food everyone hated it lmao

CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ATE IT WITH SPOONS MOST OF THE TIME?
“i don’t like the water” brooo?? is ramen noodles not stir fry
the 1 girls ramen was dry asf
The nigerian woman was way too confident about it
Ramen is supposed to be soupy and not dry guy.
They all make disgusting looking ramen
bro- i eat Ramen everyday day(not even in college yet, and don't plan on it either), what you mean "too much water", bitch, Ramen is SOUP i get they get the like 5$- packets, but like i eat those most of the time and they taste WAYYY better with "water" who the hell says "i don't like the water" when we talking about SOUP aka Ramen, oh i know who says that, A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SOCIOPATH        also i personally would like the last girls ramen at the end because, i love shrimp in my noodles and plus hers actually has "WATER"
Oluwamayowa Thinks She's The Best Not Cool Good Thing She Lost
Nah them clumps killllledddd me😭😭😭
"There's not enough shrimp" like they aren't expensive at all specially for broke students
Ramen has water in it wtf am i looking at Its literally on google Don't just call some Dry asf noodle a ramen
i’ll rather have plain noodles with Hot sauce.
dude they're all mean af wtf
The one cheetah print girl is a bitch tbh
Me with just regular nothing on top ramen in a cup 😃
The “water” is called broth XD (sorry if I spelled that wrong)
why are they eating dry ramen??
Why is everything dry?😐
The fact she said she doesnt like because "its salty" yet at the end says "season the ramen"
They didnt just called them out being broke lmao 😭
These people are clueless, Ramen is a soup based food. Which means its supposed to be in a broth. LOL
"If you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say it" To everyone saying bad stuff about them just don't.
Yo am I the only one that wanted to see the Afro girl’s reaction with her ratings
They got a new slogan ramen matters    please i am not a racist don't come at me
They really acting like broth isn’t suppose to be in ramen bye
ramen is supposed to have liquid cause it’s noodles and SOUP it’s not stir fry and it isn’t supposed to be dry or not salty cause ramen does have a shit ton of sodium so i don’t think any of these ppl know what GOOD ramen is-
6:16 I know she did not say the ramen was watery 😀 like do you not know how ramen is made??#&(@*![×>
Why none of the ramen has any broth tho...
So people really out here eating dry ramen when it’s supposed to be a soup 🍜 😂
why are they so mad about RAMEN... having BROTH LMAOOOO
it’s always the one who talks the most smack ends up having the worst plate😩
“It has too much water” BRUHH ITS SOUP, DO YOU NOT READ THE INGREDIENTS ON THE BACK OF THE PACK
my ramen for anyone who wants to try something new  i stole it from my brother and i do really like it  ingredients  2 eggs 1 pack of ramen green onion  a few broccoli florets  instructions  boil water in medium size pot put in the ramen noodles and throw in the eggs as well stir the eggs in with the ramen once fully cooked, put some of the water into the bowl and soak the broccoli a bit if you want it to be aesthetically pleasing take out the broccoli, put in the noodles, stir in the seasoning packet and then put the broccoli on top, if not just do it all except for the broccoli part. finally, cut some green onion, and add spices/ hot sauce to your liking boom egg drop ramen  cheap, protein packed, nutritional(ish), and really good :D
The certain typhoon ultrastructually murder because organisation terminally bolt behind a wholesale believe. alike, lyrical east
WHO DOESNT MAKE THEIR RAMEN WITH EXTRA JUICE LEFT IN THE BOWL??? Everybody who likes dry ramen is a weirdoooo
WHO DOESNT MAKE THEIR RAMEN WITH BROTH LEFT IN THE BOWL! Everybody who likes dry ramen is a weirdoooo

Whatever happened to just boiling water, adding the noodles, and putting the flavor in. The true college way.
“too much water” it’s literally a soup 👀
Why are they talking like this
Ramen is supposed to be with water once the water is gone it’s just plain noodles
I like the girl in the ponytail cuz she did her best to be nice :)
The girl with the Afro needs to calm down
All their noodles look dry asf

alternative title "these people who barely know what ramen is try eachothers anime spaghetti."
Nah, none of them know anything about ramen whatsoever. Please explain what too watery means.
Woke up and chose 19 dollar fortnite card

If you're going to make Ramen dry. What the FUCK is the point.!

That boy was too rude and the girl with the leopard was a tiny bit rude but uhhhh all rue tbh
i live in japan and,I genuinely feel so weirded out.
OH MY GOD RAMEN IS MEANT TO HAVE WATER SOMETIMES IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD AND DOES IT REALLY NEED TO BE EVERY COLOUR OF THE RAINBOW IF YOU ARE A "BROKE COLLEGE KID"
Bro- as an Asian, it makes me so upset when they said “I DoNt LiKe ThE wAtEr”........
That cheetah top girl is so full of her self
"Season the ramen guys!!! "   *her two seconds before*   "Why is it salty...😐"
Okay this is supposed to be broke ramen,but shrimp is real expensive like that ain't broke shit
Why do they all have absolutely no juice like you know the ramen water you have,  isn’t it in the instructions that you leave a bit of water or at least cook it for 2 minutes tops.........I don’t know I don’t know
Imagine not liking soupy Ramen, ITS AMAZING
"This shit look dry as hell" 😂😂😂
"I prefer my ramen a little bit more dry"  YOU MEAN THE WAY IT CAME💀
YOO WHEN THE WHEN THE CHEETAH PRINT GIRL GOT HER RAMEN TESTED 💀💀

"I would've added color" who adds color ramen is supposed to be plain this girl trying to diss everyone and be like I'm gonna win but has the worst score I hope she saw her score too
I love how all these people act like there ramen is amazing LIKE WHERE IS THE BROTH ITS SUPPOSED TO AHVE BROTH 😂
why do y’all call it ramen 😭
Ok but why they using spoons!! Ahh
I find it funny how I only see anime pfp and girl pfp who are getting pressed lmao
When you are Indonesian and likes to eat ramen during college, not because you are broke but it’s just part of our diet 💀💀💀
The girl with animal print acting like she is gordan Ramsey. Lol
they acting like ramen some godlike food that only 1 in 10000 people can make like wtf just eat it
Why they eating it with a spoon tho😕 that’s the only thing bothering me 🙄at least give them a fork if there is no chopsticks 😩
We have to pay for parking and FOR BOOKS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE??? Noooooo
The girl that lost act way too bougie
Damn I wanted to see the 3 of them talk together afterwards
Bruh just do maruchan with lime juice and salt it’s good
100% get 2 packs of flavouring and cook the Raman in water and the microwave one cup of milk and mix the flavouring packets in the milk and add you cooked Raman in the milk shit is fire
Can I point out that they are all black?? This is loki sterotypical
who the fuck would eat dry ramen
@iiam_.le：God loves you live for him instead of the world read your Bible so you can know more about God and his Son Jesus Christ 💕
The over confident ones usually lose everytime LMAO
The guys clearly should have won but he gave out the nicest highest ratings so without his own rating he lost. Anyone else think he should have won or is it just me?
Let me tell you my ramen recipe  Step one. Water  Step two. Ramen noodles  Step three. Microwave Step four. Flavor pack  That’s it
Broke but picky- come on guys 😂😂
they were all kinda annoying to be honest...
"I would prefer my ramen to be a bit more dry" oh girl we know 👀👀👀
this honestly hurts the Asian within me. There's soup with ramen
It’s always the cockiest who have the worst
I would prefer to eat cheyene’s ramen, isnt it usually ramen with lots of water???
That ramen was dry af it’s supposed to be soup...
her : "its salty"  Me: *laughs in white*
Cheyenne had the only one that looked like ramen 😂
https://youtu.be/TvUCPiSUMzs.
To be honest from my point of view all of them have bad taste in Ramen😂
Black lives matter..!🤎🖤
Bruv Ramen is SUPPOSED to have liquid in it. Yall thinking about stir-fry noodles i dunno xD. This is broke college ramen, of course there's gonna be one shrimp in your bowl.
“it’s to salty” “It’s to bland”
Where's the SOUP?!?!?!
Just a coincident they are all black
“This shit look dry as hell” LMAOOOOO PLSS 💀🤚🏽😭
SHOW US THEIR REACTIONS TO THE SCORES BRO
Why don’t people like the left over flavorful water
i literally can’t believe they don’t know ramen is usually made with a broth 😂 it’s not usually a “dry” food. edit: i love yall sharing your ramen recipes in the comments 💞✨ might be stealing a few 👀
Do these people not know what ramen is??
ayo marcus was violating the whole time😭
3:18 when he said this I died 💀💀💀
I don’t even season my ramen
I'm Nigerian and that is not how we cook ramen- there do be enough seasoning and salt, our ramen dont ball up like that and the ramen aint dry, i most of us never add atagungun , and we sometimes have water in ours. Our ramen is usually made with at least curry powder and the seasoning packet, and it be tasting bomb, especially when u top it with that boiled egg soaked in the water, and dont worry, it dont stick like that. Honestly, we dont even call it ramen, we call it indomie, so maybe that's were the miscommunication was happened and she decided to make.....that
Nah try marùcuan noodles with some lemon and some Valentina salsaś
I'm scared of these ramen  Like, I get it, im broke too but still, it's not hard to make good ramen
“It’s so dry” maybe add some water and it won’t be
olu's confidence went down the drain
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO NOT BE DRY AND ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER💀✋
If you ain’t making a chi chi you ain’t doing it right 😅
am i the only one that used to eat it with like a lost of the broth/soup thing or
My only question is WHERE IS THE WATER IN THE RAMEN WHAT THE HELL
6:40 said the one who didn't cook their ramen. 😂
uncultured
do they not understand that there’s supposed to be soup in ramen oml
The cheeta print girl like... "more color" if your broke you dont care about "color" and ramen more dry?!? ! Girrrrlll what do you think ramen is?
Wtf do you mean by "there's a lot of water" RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WET-
Nigerians or other African people on shows like this always come and be shouting their country inspired food will win but they always lose. Like they try to b extra extra. So annoying
Sis said it was watery but hers was CRUNCHY
Bruh idk if y'all had ramen but that isn't ramen, its just noodles 💀
the nigerian girl made me so mad. she thought she was the best but she got a 2 XD
Ite why tf they eating it with a spoon!!!!??
Can't y'all just put the ramen in the microwave put the season packet then eat it, I thought this was about broke college students not chefs (the extra thing I do is just put to eggs )
Ya done fucked up
so we all gonna agree we glad that girl lost? just me?
If you eat your Raman dry you’re eating it wrong unless it’s not cooked
She worried abt color when her shit needed water
My cousin makes the best ramen 👑
I was so weirded out when I saw that all the other contestants had 0 water. That's not Ramen. From what I have heard, that's soba. Ramen is a Noodle SOUP. :/ I respect their prefrence(jesus, tell me I spelled that right, I turned off my grammarly thing.), but that is not the proper word for their "ramen"'s characteristics. Sorry! 😔
The girl at @3:05 got all her bad energy returned back to her. She was hard on that first dude and then they were hard on her. This is why kindness matters!
There's always that one person...smh🤦🏾‍♀️
Okay first of all...WHERE'S THE SOUP?
Water!? Who tf eats ramen with no BROTH why they calling it water too
Not her trying to judge how REAL ramen looks like, she was like “my ramen is totally gonna win” when hers doesn’t even cooked  Edit:thx for 3k likes its the most likes I have ever got😭
All there noodles looked like the same color
‘With a different vibe’ okay💀
She likes her ramen as dry as her love life
Wait they eat ramen WITH OUT THE SOUP WATER THINGY WHATTTT MINES LIKE MOSTLY WATER 😂😂
They all look dry. It's soup. Where is the moisture?
i’m sorry but the girl in cheetah needs to humble herself...
Them: adding really exotic spices    Me: cUpeD rAmeN IS ThE bEsT
People always be sleeping on wet noodles tho😒
Dry ramen is so weird
Lordddd they all did bad surprised she even won 😭
Why does everyone's ramen suck!
Bro if this Nigerian girl dont stfu
Do not watch if Asian you would want to disown these people.
Bitch said too salty then acted like had no seasoning
So the moral of this video is: they’re all bad at making ramen and eating ramen with a spoon should be illegal. Also ramen is supposed to have broth to an extent so…..
It’s funny them 3 broke acting like they getting a 5 star cuisine from someone who got money to make it better food is food
All their Raman looked like shit.
TLDR : cheese,eggs,and carrots are bomb in ramen,all together ot seperate from eachother Experiment with your food people that's how we got all teh things we love today :)         I've been messing with my ramen used to do just ramen and add some no salt seasoning and some garlic powder (very basic) but i loved it,but now i've been trying eggs and that is so good depending on how much you like eggs i'd say stick to 1-2,and also i've tried cheese,you can mix the eggs with cheese and that works very well too because the cheese just melts down completely and just makes the broth more creamy and adds nice flavor and we all know cheese mixes well with eggs and eggs absorb flavour very well so you will notice your ramen is hella flavored,and i've tried carrots in the ramen give the carrots a little time first i also throw in a little extra of the above seasoning into season the carrots just a bit (yes you can micro carrots and they come out and taste the exact same as boiled carrots because you're just boiling them in a microwave) but when they are almost done to your liking then add your ramen and seasoning and any extra you add,the carrots make it so much more airy and make it feel just a bit more healthy (depends if you care but yeah) i wanna try jalepenos soon with it to add a nice kick to things and as much as i love soy sauce and a good hot sauce i never buy it i always forget about it and then when i get home i'm like "omg i'll put some soy sauce in and here and this'll taste so fu**ing good...where's my soy sauce?...omfg i forgot it" needa get some sesame seed and sesame oil aswell and wanna try different veggies with it,i assume many will work because ramen is such a flexible type of food but gotta try it with my own tastes in mind
"the ramen is too watery"  me: you know instant ramen you cook with water.
it all looks nasty
The girl with the fro talking all that stuff but hers was the worst
Olu or wtv the fuck her name is got a ego bruh her ramen wasn’t even cooked bruh 💀💀💀

“This is gonna win, bring it on” *gets 2 points* LMFAOOOO
Cheetah girl was like "I'm gonna win because my ramen has a different vibe" well it looks like a fucking stone if that's what you're talking about and the funny part is that Marcus was being nice to her for giving her a 2 she was hating on the other peoples ramen for actually being good yeah ok-

All you need is some soy sauce and Sriracha and you can’t beat it

Cheetah girl: its too salty Also cheetah girl: it has no taste, needs some seasoning, Like wha😐
"I don't like all the water it looks like it got flooded" LAST I CHECKED RAMEN IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE NOODLES THO-

Y THEY USE SPOONS TO EAT RAMEN-
LMFAO THEIR IS ALWAYS ONE PERSON WHO IS SO COCKY😭 then everyone end up hating their meal 🤣🖐🏼
"i prefer my ramen dry!"💁‍♀️ yah girll we know!!!! we know!
Cheetah print girl was adopted by white people  It’s edible but bland
Where tf is the BROTH??!! The only one that does a little bit is condemned for being watery? Y'all never had an actual ramen before or what? LOL
Have y’all even tried ramen like actual ramen talkin bout “I don’t like the water” ITS SOUP ITS RAMEN ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER
How are you broke and then put shrimp on your ramen
" It's salty.... Are you trying to KILL me!!!!!" Shush!

I have a colonoscopy tomorrow so today I’m on a clear liquid diet and this video is HAUNTING MEEEE. I WANT RAMEN SOOOO BADDD 😭😭😭  they’re making me impatient by not shoving everything in their mouth right away and eating it.
“mY mOm iS sPaNiSh”  Girl what?!

Don’t be calling them broke
She was talking bout that boy Raman noodles and got a two😂🤣
Bro buying a pack at Walmart and heating it really isn’t that hard
A lot of people here are bashing them saying that they don’t like the water in the ramen, yeah that’s how it’s supposed to be, but not all people like it like that-
Wow.
Why Is Nobody Talking About How They're Eating Ramen With Spoon's
Bro it's RAMEN its not coming out of a five star restaurant.
That girl acts like she's the best while she's the worst 🤦🏻‍♀️
Yo, just buy some indomie. That will save ur life and u didnt really need add-on🤷‍♀️
Everyone talking about every other detail:    Me: ...why is y'all eating ramen with a spoo- y'know what I'm done im- lmfao bye 💀✋
Tapatio and lemon is all you need
the third one is the only one with common sense lol
Complaining about broth in ramen...they were all just shitting on the others so they could win.
Cheyenne is the only one who’s not annoying.. the dude and the other girl seemed like they don’t know what tf ramen actually is lmao
Yo quick question, how do you fuck up ramen
uhm so uh.... BOIL the ramen, in actual water. for a period of time. ALMOST NOBODY RAMEN WAS DONE?????
Girl with the fro doing too much

Each recipe was so drastically different lol
Water 😭✋ Lord I can't pfft
Cheetah print is a b-
"are you trying to kill me" - cheeta girl over salt
Cheetah lady's ramen isn't ramen, it's the Sahara desert in a bowl. And the essence of a dead animal.
IF YALL BE COOKIN YALL NOODLES TILL THEY BE BOILING YALL GOTTA GET THE FUUUUUCK OUTTA HERE WITH THAT SHIT
The girl with the puffy hair is SO annoying
Leopard print mad annoying tbh

The leopard shirt girl clowned herself the whole way.
Of course there all black
“I Perfer my ramen dry” girl we know there are clumps of noodles.
lmao the cheetah girl
Ew i feel offended
Bruh olu or whatever her name is was talking so much trash I thought she was gonna have heat Raman but hellllll naaahhhh 😭 you could pick it up. And she continued to be problematic.
Why is the one person who doesnt like the rest have the worse things looks at buzz feeds grandma pies LMFAO
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATERRRRR
This video makes me so triggered, they never had real ramen before, apparently they don’t know what soup is and the cheetah girl is annoying af stfu wannabe chef
Olu: My ramen is the best, I know I’m for sure gonna win Marcus and Cheyenne: Why this shit look dry as hell *continues to talk about how trash it is*  Also why are they talking about the water, have they not seen real ramen before? 😃
They don’t like the water-       Ramen is a soup not a flipping chip 🤦‍♀️ smh...
idek their damn name: I dont really like all the water Me: wha- 👁👄👁
“Broke”
All of these people must be bullshittin, they don't know how to make good ramen man. Just use ramen, an egg, and some chili sauce. If you wanna get fancy throw some more spices in but god damn...
why aren’t there any asians representing ramen? idk just doesn’t sit right with me
i- do mfs even know what ramen is...? the “water” is soup... 😀wth
The girl with the Afro was kind of getting on my nerves, she was trying WAY to hard to be the best and clearly stating that
Imagine messing up cooking instant noodle🙈 I can't even eat clumpy noodle feels so gross in your mouth 🤮🤮
2:44 I thought you liked yours on the dryer side?
The girl with the puffy hair, wimoansmdodkdnenwjwskso, was so cocky I swear
Bruh it’s broke college ramen you shouldn’t expect that much 😂
Nahhhhhh here’s what you can add that will keep it “broke college student”. Scrambled eggs added to the broth (egg drop soup), dumplings, garlic powder, green onions, a little soy sauce, black/white pepper, thinly sliced meat of your choice (probably chicken cuz it’s BROKE college student), some sort of veggie like bok choy, brussle sprouts, korean rice cakes, etc.
olu ( the one in the cheeta print) was so over dramatic " I like my ramen dry" sis we know💀 and her expressions, she even fake cried a lil I think? check it: 2:06
That ain’t no Nigerian style ramen pls 💀
All of their ramen looks so sad. Even the ramen just crushed up is better
Bruh ur supposed eat the ramen with the soup...
The ramen is salty but has no flavor??? Confusion!????!!?
The title
They all kinda look nasty
Im asian and i say. “Ramen is Ramen.”
Why do people hate ramen water...its a nice refresher after you eat the noodles wtf
I’m a broke college student .. only thing I can add to my noodles is hot sauce 😂😂
" i prefer my ramen a little more dry" yeah dry like the sierra desert
i didnt ever have to eat the ramen to see it looks dry af and i dont eat ramen
the fact that all the comments are trashing all of their little renditions of ramen LOL
All of their ramen looks bad 💀💀 it so dry the girl with the braids ramen doesn’t look bad tho
They say it looks dead but then THEIRS looks like it literally has no color 😐 it's ramen
Girl with the afro eats her ramen out of packet 💀
“Are you trying to kill me🤓” like stfu
"broke" But didnt they also get payed or payed FOR the place to go, unless its community then I can see that.
Afro girl: I would prefer my ramen a little more dry 🏜️  Viewers: Yes we know
Shoutout to chey for actually knowing how to cook ramen lmao
I wonder why the afro chick was talking

Am I weird or do other people wonder why college kids are broke
The other clowns in my dorm can’t cook either lmao
😐
Olu “ I like my ramen dryer” Me that is a clump
Y’all- ramen is a soup with NOODLES. It’s not supposed to be dry and clumpy. Also, didn’t the first dude just add chicken to theirs ?
https://youtu.be/Eax4oQb5p04
im so mad that they dont like water in there raman?!
BROKEE?
The dude is so mean
2:05 I already don’t like her...

Third girl dumb annoying

Broke black college kids?
You didn’t have to be redundant in the title

Why you called them “BROKE” LMAO 🤐😭
Man I would just get maruchan get a lime and tapatio there y se no la come la voy a chingar
afro girl made my blood boil...
The girl with the leopard print was being way too extra and conceited. The girl that graduated from U of Bridgeport seems a lot more mature and less superficial.
This video just confuses me
Am I the only who who noticed that they're eating ramen with spoons...
Is Marcus a lil' *limp hand*
broke = black?
I like the black rice ramen a lot — I got really into nice flavors and sapporo when I was working on business ventures with asians
Bro, just put it in the microwave, or boil it, and put the packet in.. it's that simple.
My taiwanese roommate made me noodles because I bought her and the other korean roommates pizza hut, and that was “expensive.” We did it again when the girl who got kicked out for eating Durian came to stay
ramen without WaTeR... WTHHHHHHH 😭😭
Why is it all African Americans?
“Broke”  Damn they roasted the homies
"its salty"  lmao then says this "season the ramen" lol
These people never even seen like a minute of naruto like the "WaTeR' is supposed to be there
The caption got me
A spoon for ramen 😰
Wheres the soup lol
Olu was so shady but her ramen was clumpy 🤢
Who else watched this while eating ramen
Cheyenne’s one is the only one that looked like ramen 😭
So nobody going to talk about the title 💀!
The two contestants (excluding Cheyenne) was so uncultured about Ramen. I’m sorry 🤚🏼”WaTeR???” Ramen is noodles and broth!!!! If it has no broth, then we just call it stir fry noodles 😭🤚🏼 I’m sorry, my family sold Ramens for a living in Vietnam and that comment just triggered me.
Cheyennes looked so good lol. also why are they all so narcissistic i keep having to edit, but i love water in my soup and they be like "i dont like the water" what
Just eat the fucking food picky fucks
COME ON FULL NAME OLUWAMAYOWA!!!!! No contractions, love to see it!  Edit: Sis while I enjoy the confidence, bring it down several notches cause I was having nausea from the sight of your ramen 😩
its ✨salty are you trying to kill me✨ instantly told she has never had real/good ramen
This is what broke people eat these days?
It's the spoon for me
Bruh cheetah girl is on something, she putting everyone else’s noodles down to make hers look better 😂😭

I couldn’t eat the two girls ramen it has stuff I’m allergic to
When your cocky, yet noone likes your food

The one with the animal print shirt she sound like she’s a spoiled bragger like WTF
Ramen +1 egg+ slice of American cheese ur welcome
When the other two were literally acting like their all that but they both lost ✋😭
The girl wearing the animal print is just doing THE MOST for no reason
They had no juice where is the juice
The cheetah print girl is making me sooooooooooooooooooooooooo annoyed
2:02 - That a joke right?  Bitch! Ramen IS salt!  🙃🙃
Can we all agree Olu was the most annoying
UM ramen is a soup wtf. Are they dumb? How are they even in college?
Olu: Mine is gonna be the best. Cheyenne and Marcus: *hates the ramen* Olu: 👁👄👁
They ate that...with a spoon
*crime bosses try each others drugs*
my peanut butter pickle sandwich would kill all that thats on baby
Why are they acting like Ramen is spaghetti
“My mom is Spanish” they are stupid asf
“ITS SO SALTYY” “There’s no flavor”  smh
Gggghh
I hope they don't order ramen in real life, it's a big ass bowl of broth🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️why lordt
they were all SOOO salty
The title killed me BROKE COLLEGE KIDS 😩🤚🏽
it’s always the ones with the biggest ego who lose
the girl in she Cheetah print...😀

Ok but where’s the hot sauce
bruh we dont get to hear their reactions when they find out the scores??
Watery girl yours was dry 🙄🙄🙄
This omea wa mu bitch need to stfu lol  😂
Don't knock cheese in your ramen. It's better than you think. You can go American slice to make it creamy or shredded to make it chewy.
Am i the only one who loves the broth of the ramen?
Cheyenne is the only one who seemed to be fair/genuine :l
Wow this college students clearly don't know what real ramen taste and looks like...
Bro imagine her reaction when she got a 2😂😂😂
No wonder they were broke, they be adding extra spices to their ramen. I’m all about that 30 packets of Thai spice ramen for £10 on Amazon, then Ann a fried egg and you good to go.
what kind of "broke" college student can afford shrimp
Her I threw some shrimp in there  Me:👁👄👁I only see one
black shirt girl- “this ramen tastes good, smells good, j give it a 6”   me- wut
She said my mom is Spanish
We gonna talk about how they eating ramen with a spoon? One of them at least
Those were some hating ass people lmaoo 💀 have they never had actual ramen before?! IT'S LITERALLY SOUP
Who doesn't eat Ramen without the water.. Have yall see the smegsyy ramens in Japan?! Has so much broth (which can be technically called the water of the dish am I right) still be bussin thoo🥰😍
sometime i just eat ramen straight from the packet                   just dry..                      IT'S GOOD! D:
What the heck, there is supposed to be broth in ramen?!
What a bunch of negative Nancy’s
Why olu trying to put everyone’s down 😷🤮
She just say crayfish a seasoning?
That 1 girl is Hella hateful and not relatable at all she is just waaay to up herself.. I mean bish calm down coz U ain't it alright. ANYWAY this would have been an amazing video without 1 person

WHO TF EAT RAMEN W/O WATER NIGGA
they went wrong by waKING UP
the meanest person always gets the worst scoreeee 😭
The Afro girl said the first ramen was salty and then said it had no seasoning
who eats instant ramen with a spoon-
My question is why does the ramen need color. It’s about taste..and what’s up with them spoons
See i cook mine than pour the water out if its the cheap ass ramen but my shit dont look like that theirs
*I like mine a little more dry * me: yes I know
and to be frank with you
If you need to pay for parking you ain't broke
who the fUCK eats dry ramen
Marcus is so cute!
Pov: westerner dunno tf is ramen n trynna be edgy 😂
Idk why I put this here but I like the spicy shin ramyun with a bit of extra spring onions, some rice cake slices, gochugang and sometimes an egg if I'm feeling fat.
NOT THE SHOUT OUT TO THE SHRIMP PLZZZ THEY’RE SO FUNNY
“It’s a bit watery” “no color”  GIRLLL YOURS IS DRY AND CHUNKY, AND THAT IS HOW RAMEN IS MADE. THERES SUPPOSED TO BE BROTH
that’s not ramen that’s literally pasta-
Where is the soup💀💀🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Are you ok???? Most ramen literally has broth. I'm cryingggg
Bro y'all weird it's supposed to have liquid it's soup omg who likes it dry...
I am a 14 year old.. do they know what ramen is?
Ok so miss ma'am if it's too salty then how is it not seasoned. Also the broth is kinda what makes good ramen good ramen.
I just love how the girl with the Afro is like “it’s so salty you tryna kill me!?” And then like three seconds later she’s like “theresss no flavor, it’s so dryyy” and lol but like also her ramen was like SUPER dry
Contestant i prefare my Ramon dry lol your telling me bro your Ramon was dry n lumpy as hell
Okay but why eat ramen without the water?
Boy! You don’t ever put salt in noodles. It’s ENOUGH salt in the seasoning pack. I knew lil cheetah was going to get the lowest score. She was way too confident.
Ramen and dry don’t go in the same sentence
I like my Ramen soupy I be slurping that shit after I eat the noodles
Their ramen isn't even ramen 💀the last girl was fine but those first two realize that ramen is a soup... right?
All y’all’s ain’t gon nothinnnnn on mine

As a Nigerian girl who makes ramen being a broke college student, we do not claim her ramen skills.
I was very very very very very broookkkkke
How are you gonna be broke and picky
Bro that olu girl over thinking it ITS RAMEN IT COST $1.99
I was a broke college kid too, back then. But at least I know how to cook ramen noodles
Olu girl your personality is a 2.
Okay for 1 the leopard print girl ramen wasn't even good n she had the most negative things to say, 2 she never have real ramen bc it's supposed to have a broth, n 3 why tf is she eating ramen with a spoon...
Ramen IS A SOUP a it’s supposed to be watery not DRY
simple noodle packages with spices in it, boil them seperately, fond in one bowl, and the noodles in another bowl, until its ready for assembly... then fry up some meat, prefarely so its crispy, with salt\pepper,,,, Noodles first in the bowl, then put condements "meats\salad" w\e u put on ur food, then put the hot fond to reheat the cold noodles too stop the (cookin process), ezpz.. Noobs...

LET ME FIND OUT WE GOT A BLACK BUZZFEED CHANNEL...gives y’all a new subscriber
I don't want dry Ramon noodles 🍜 it suppose to be soup🍲
It’s “watery” BECAUSE ITS A SOUP WTF
all of them are weird ramen for me
You know Nigerians by the way they talk😂😂what a mess
“There’s no color” 😐 bitch it’s a dollar ramen tf
I don't think they know what ramen actually is. 😆
On Jesus i started checking girl in the cheetah print like since when adding "color" to ramen NOODLE SOUP more important than adding water? Talking hella trash while her stiff a$$ noodles doin the mannequin challenge in that bowl 🤨🤦🏾‍♂️
the girl in da cheetah print was full of herself
Who else likes the ramen that is like RED- just me?
Y’all shoulda had the other people’s reaction, especially the one with the dry ramen
the girl with the cheetah print could really get popped
🤌🏿
this channel is the wannabe buzzfeed
The gurl with the big hair is just  to confident
all of their ramen looked...  questionably😶 maybe its just me but i watch a lot of mukbangs so my noodles be ✨immaculate✨ cheese, egg, hot sauce, thick chewy noodles, creamy now im hungry😭
I had a feeling the one that was talking the most mess would be the worst .... Never put ppl down like that it isn't cool
It's called oddles an Noodles not ramen
My ramen be bussin
The cheetah print girl is doing the most like GIRLLLLL
I knew this was bs when they called it ramen 🤣
So they broke in TASTE too
“I like my ramen dry”  yea we can tell
I think what we should take from all of these videos is that everyone has their own taste and you should acknowledge that not everyone will like your cooking or that someone will always be a better cook than you.
Yeah i knew  olu noodles was gon be trash just off the energy 😂😂😂😂
Me watching while eating noodless:          👁️👄👁️🍜✨
I see i got baited to watch a buzzfeed video. Well played, now fuck off.
The title of this video has me weak tho😭 💀⚰
Olu is that woman from "black moms try other moms soul food" I knew she wasn't gonna win from the start😂😂😂
Any confused Asians here bc it's so easy to make ramen appetising but none of em did it 😭😭
All of their ramen looks *FUCKING* garbage
“i prefer my ramen a little dry” you don’t say😀
Are we seriously comparing INSTANT RAMEN?
SPOONS-
SHE WAS SO CONFIDENT LMFAOOOO-
Miss, lady, ma'am, ramen is ALL about the broth 💀🪓
Lesson of the day, the nicest chick always succeeds.
THAT RAMEN BE LOOKING DRY AF BRUH
Olu annoyed the hell outta me she has such an attitude like holy cow girl thinks she’s some queen 😭✋🏼💀
Olu really got backfired lmao
Shouldn’t an instant ramen have water???
Everything about this video is frustrating HAHAHA especially the two contestants that lost HAHAHHAA
Girl be dissing this mans ramen and then she brings barely cooked ramen
Next up “homeless people try each other’s houses” Edit: it’s joke btw
It’s the way they were both so cocky and still lost for me. 💀💀
"i like my ramen dry" we know bro 😭😭😭😭
Her ramen looked like chips lol.
at the end of the day they were all bad.
Ramen is supposed to be in broth or “water” fyi.
they should have brought ppl who actually no wtf ramen noodles is💀 they can’t be from no struggle eating that shii second girls looked good tho
It’s ramen noodles not 5 star takeout 😭
When i was a broke student i cooked my fire noodle ramen with melted cheese and add a little bit of milk to lessen the spicyness and maybe put some sausages in 😎
Why is everyone ignoring the fact that the girl in the cheetah print was so confident in winning talking about her is going to be the best and her seasonings are the best girl your stuff is still dry😂
This was painful to watch
Crayfish.  In ramen. As a Nigerian.  Even I'm disgusted
I know im going to get hate for this, i like nothing in my ramen except the packet, just me?. Ok
those ramens look broke
The defiantly not eating ramen with spoons
“I don’t like the “water” it looks like it came from the streets” YOU GUYS ARE EATING INSTANT RAMEN AND RAMEN HAS BROTH YOU ABSOLUTE•
The girl with the cheetah print shirt is a little too confident about her ramen
idk why but i have really strong cravings for salty shit so ramen is the perfect excuse for me to just fuckin overdose on sodium. i make the maru-chan chicken flavor ramen, add some chicken bouillon powder (which is basically the same thing as the flavor packet, i just want MORE), pepper, and SALT✨😂 y’all help am i dying why do i crave so much salt 😂
WHEN IT WAS THE SECOND GIRLS TURN AFTER TALKING ALL THAT BS HER FACE IN THE CORNER WAS SO FUNNY AND ITS SENDING ME SHES JUST SITTING THERE LIKE “😀” IM CRYING
where is the water?
Its a ramen of a broke person just eat yall!😂
Serious suggestion for any other college students here: Microwave a bag of frozen vegetables (the one I buy has sliced carrots and then whole broccoli and cauliflower) and mix it in with your ramen after you cook it. I usually play around with my own spices instead of the flavor packet, but you can season it however.  The whole thing is like, $2-3 and it usually last me all day
how you gonna do that to em on national womens month AHAHAHA XD
you gonna let me cook some fuggen ramen? ill fuck your shit up
cheetah print girl gets me mad 🤠
Olu is a hater lmfaoooo
Boke Hinata Boke
can u even call any of these ramen like wtf 😭
"Ramen has to much water" wtf are they talking about
Its always the ones that got the most to say who's is the worst
“I will prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” yuuup we can tell 😀
Lol the broke college kids are black
Sis really said add some crawfish you’re a broke college student... I do be likein my Ramen crunchy but that’s not crunchy that’s right out the bag 😂
THIS MAKES ME THANK GOD EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I'M ASIANNNNN
Why the olu being so mean
Imagine bragging bout seasoning and taste when her ramen shows up clumpy as hell. lol. Also the fuck is all these dry-ass ramens. If they're too broke to go to a ramen shop, at least google some pics.

Black beauties
"I don't like all the water" ITS BROTH NOT WATER

Olu I feel like she was doin the most.
All 3 wasn't great But to each their own I don't like ramen but my wife does & makes hers how she pleases
Dear producers can we stop making this just everyone talking crap, this series has too much ego. Like its okay to enjoy other people's cooking.
Who use A SPOON TO EAT RAMEN
try mi goreng ramen. it’s only a couple cents more and it’s amazing.
cheetah girl is the type of girl who gets spoiled rotten and then gets thrown in the dumpster once teens hit
I can’t remember her name but the girl in cheetah print got on my nerves!!😫😫
That girl Olu with the cheata clothes thinks her ramen are a diffrent ✨vibe✨ LIKE HHAHAHHAHA 😭😭 AND SHE THINKS BLACK PPL CAN COOK BETER LIKE HECK NO
I still eat ramen just the expensive Korean Ramyun.
Olu’s entire personality is being “different” from other girls she’s so ✨q u i r k y✨  Edit: I- that’s a lot of likes my guy 👀
I love how the girl I’m cheetah print was shit talking then both of them hated her ramen rofl
“It’s too watery” Dumbasses...
“i don’t like the water” mf ramen is soup and the noodles itself not some mf white ass thing. “mInE ACtUAlLY hAS fLAVoUr” like stfu

So we all hate cheetah print girl right.

Bruuuuh I don't understand why their ramen has no broth at all???? Like have y'all seen ramen????
“Broke college students” - “ it needs to have fresh shrimp throughout”....hmmmm...not as broke as I was I guess 👋👋
when the girl with the cheetah shirt said “i prefer my ramen dry” i bursted out laughing 😂😂💀
Why does it always gotta be the most over confident ones with the shittiest recipes 💀
I don’t know what it is when they say water instead
First off where’s the water? It’ll never taste good that dry
if they’re allowed to add more ingredients why don’t they make a little sauce it makes it so good 😖
It's always the overconfident and judgmental ones who fail LMAOOO
I may just be high as hell or I thought the little icon of them on the right corner was moving. Girl I saw facial expressions changing n shit 👀🤣
OK RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER OMG. AND IT DEF AINT SUPPOSED TO BE DRY AND CRUNCHY
It's too salty she says but her home land be unpacking salt bricks 🧱🧱🧱🧱

“It’s too salty”   “There’s not enough flavor” girl if you don’t make up your mind
Girl with the Afro is mad annoying
The girl who went last actually knows how to make ramen because who da fook doesn’t have the soup part their ramen like they really don’t know how to make food and I’m 10 and can make better ramen. UGHHHHH PEOPLE THESE DAYS. They are trying to make chow mane.
I'm shook they keep saying it's WATERY  ITS RAMEN SOUP HELLO? Also why they all have spoons to eat ramen wth
The girl in the cheetah print aggravated me ramen looked the worse but was judging others ramen talking adding some color like she knows anything about Asian culture and how to prepare ramen
Easiest way to make ramen better: Just boil the noodles like normal drain the water add just enough milk to almost cover the noodles Add a tablespoon of butter Put in your seasoning Cook for 1-2 minutes stirring often.  Makes your ramen have a super creamy texture and all the flavor sticks to the noodles.
Ramen with a spoon da fook🤮
cheyenne’s ramen looks good
Girl wit the Afro tryna act all different bc she black for attention 🙄🙄
Im sorry but all their ramen looks rough 😭😭😭😩 and they all seemed like they was hating on each other except miss girl with the braids
Mfs when they call broth water and think they did something. Like babes- its supposed to have broth. Its Ramen. Google it.
Ramen is watery because you put broth with it
“My mom is Spanish” um....what does that even mean? Spanish is a language.
Ms cheetah print girl was going off on everyone else’s “RAHmen” and I’m like friendly reminder y’all is BROKE there’s no time for complaining about 🍜 specially when hers ain’t even cooked and the way!!!😭💀
2:42 girl im..didnt you just say it has a whole binch of salt..PLEASE
D
Did they prepare these at home or in the studio? I feel like if they had prepared it in the studio and straight out the kitchen it’ll be a lot better, those noodles look like they been sitting in the bowl the whole afternoon.
Tell me why they were eating ramen with a spoon😭
as a 15 year old who likes to eat 🖐🏽😌 i have 17 different ways to make ramen so try meee 😭
They know that ramen is like....soup right? Like...there is supposed to be broth in there...
Where is the water .... 😭✋🏽
where was the soup? That shit wasn't ramen y'all,,just plain old noodles. Im a broke college student too but at least ik to put some damn water to make the soup.
Wait ppl don’t eat ramen with the soup ?? If you have ramen I’ll show you a tasty way As a Mexican I will show you the Mexican ramen  First cook it don’t take the soup out add half a lime and then a salsa called salsa Valentina  boi Ik you gonna like it
Y’all eat y’all noodles without water wtf except the girl with the shrimp 🤦🏽🤦🏽 wtf
So... no forks were available!? 🤷🏾‍♂️
it's the chunks for me it's the dry ass noodles for me its the lack of water for me
wait... yall don’t eat ramen with broth?
“Broke college kids” 😭😭
an asian watching this i thought at least one person would do it right lmaoo, they creative tho
All the comments complaining about needing a broth. 🤣 Yes, we water drainers exist. No, my ramen isn't dry (idk how what happened to miss chunks in the video but the way I cook is that you don't miss the wetness cause it's still there.) I'm cooking it for the noodles and package, not the broth. I also add eggs to it and I don't really like egg + liquid.
None of them know how to make ramen. Also stop calling the broth "water" RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH.
Damn, I’m a kid and even I can make better ramen 😌     - *Microwave noises in the background*
Am I the only one who still call em noodles?! I never called them ramen 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why do they have Jewelry if they are broke.
Cheetah print girl thought she was the best . But them dry noodles ain’t gonna cut it the flavor is in the broth
i tend to leave the water in mine? ramen is a soup bahahah
Broooo the soup is supposed to be the best part how literally NONE of these people do it right? 😭 the soup is wear all the flavors go and then the noodles soak it up while you sip it with a spoon
Okay some people like the crunchy, chunky ramen tbh but like how are you gonna complain that ramen look or taste like ramen 🙄
The cheetah print girl was really egotistical
Why do they all look uncooked from here
I’m guessing that they don’t know that original ramen has chicken
The girl with the big hair was being so full of herself and then she brings in the clumpy ramen 💀
"it's salty" Ma'am that is the POINT.
the girl with the Afro was putting everybody down but had the worst score
Utilising brokenness for clicks smh
Ramen needs broth!! Like huh?!!?? Last girl def won!
I only eat ramen with just the drained cooked noodles, half the seasoning packet, and crunchy peanutbutter mixed in while it's still warm. And maybe garlic powder and cayenne pepper. It's good cold too imo lol
All three of them watching this video: 👁👄👁
I wanna see the reaction of the girl with the Afro when she found out she got a two because I just know she left crying or at least upset 😅
Ramen is literally supposed to be a soup with noodles what they mean “I don’t like how watery it is” 😭🤚
SHES JUDGING THE COLOR
do they know what ramen is?😭
They were complaining about the water but bruuuuhhh, is it even Ramen without soup?
Cheetah girl's laugh makes me itch.
What really bothered me this whole video is that they weren’t using chopsticks
I really had faith in cheetah girl till I saw her bowl.... And when she said she likes her more dry I- NO KIDDING
“i like my ramen dry” girl we know
"it looks grey" BRUHHH ITS FREAKING ORANGE WHAT THE HECK
yo am i trippin or is her name like “oyulamayybamab” or sum shit
the cheetah print and dude were  hella salty like their ramen
traditional ramen has juice in the bowl, i dont understand the first two kids not having any juice in the bowl, thats just noodles, not ramen... lol
Olu saying Marcus's was too dry. Olus ramen coming out looking dry as hell
Do these people not know how Ramen supposed to be made and eaten like it’s originally a soup bruh you’re supposed to crack an egg over it and put like seasonings and soy sauce but you can make it how you want but for real tf Lmaooo
The first two lacked so much logic it’s painful, RAMEN IS SOUP, how can they eat noodles so dry! Even if they trying to go at it like pasta it’s still so freaking dry! Just eat cardboard please! What the hell!
Olu’s hair is so pretty! But I don’t know about dry ramen lol
How are people making ramen without a broth? They are just eating seasoned noodles.
why did they all take out the soup 🍲😐
i think i would eat marcus’s
Why they so passionate about plastic noodles
Ramen has broth in it ._. Why do none of them have broth
the way the afro girl was saying ramen got me annoyed

BUT WHY IS IT DRY? LIKE NO BROTH, NOT BOILED....EXPLAIN

I knew I would like Cheyenne stuff cause that’s the best way to eat noddles..WATERYY
The cheetah print girl: shout out to the shrimp that saved the day.  Me: bruh your ramen was dryer than the sand on the beach... ( ramen is supposed to have water it’s called broth but if she want her noodles as dry as that then girl bye 😑😑😑😑)
Olu: this is nasty I am going to win I got all these seasons I am going to win. for sure.             me: you not going to win you got 2 points girl bye

Not them gentrifying oodles n noodles & calling it ramen. 🙃
Me being native and putting spam in it 😭
How you gonna say it’s good and then give it a 3😭💀
The title is sending me 💀
Money to look good but not for food breh

Wait a minute isn't this supposed to be ramen ramen has broth its supposed have water, its not chow mein/pancit im sorry but I could have a .35 cent ramen and make it better but everyone has different taste buds.yk yk
I can now confirm they definitely do not know what **real** ramen is.
It’s always the people with a stank attitude that has the worse food.
Ramen ....... is supposed to have water 🙄 . Second! Wtf literally no struggle ramen creativity 🤔
Oluwamayowa definitely repping Nigeria with the atagungun and fish  🇳🇬
Oh nah i don’t like the Afro girls attitude
Eww
You can tell they've never had actual ramen except for the girl that put water in hers cuz daaaaaamn. It's called broth.
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WET HSHSSHSH
not to be racist or anything how come its only black people?
Why did they all make it so dry and then complain when the girl had a little bit of water in it?!? ramen is a soup 🤨🤨🤨 do they not know what ramen is???
Does she realize it’s meant to be watery 💀it’s called broth
How hard is it to boil eggs or scramble eggs into ramen and maybe add chicken maybe spices

“Broke”
Olu was bein hype asl for no reason for em to flame on her shit immediately
What do they expect? It’s ramen! There’s supposed to be broth. Also there doesn’t *have* to be shrimp—
Is ramen even supposed to have color mrs cheeta print.
The girl with the frow💀👀
Have you ever herd the term beggars can’t be choosers
Leopard print girl gives me fish girl vibes 😭
The other girl was soo confident and she lost
That guy was ruthless
As an Asian person, I got so angry at this video. First of all, they're eating it with a SPOON??? Second of all, the hell do you mean you don't like when ramen has water in it? IT'S SUPPOSED TO, IT'S CALLED BROTH. Cheyenne is the only one I semi respect in the video.
mar-oo-chin he said
not the spoons😭😭
-Ra-men-
_That’s cool_
Can we all admit all 3 of them are annoying af 😭
.....do yall not know what soup broth is LMFAO quit calling it water
do they think ramen is japanese pasta or something like that because the fact that they don’t like broth is infuriating tbh.
*oof*
CHEYENNE IS MY NAME 😭✌️
She was so confident to
It took Cheeta girl so long to admit the other girl's ramen was good and then she started trashing it's looks... Sis it's a struggle food, ain't nobody care wether it's aesthetic or not🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ don't be embarasing us Africans out here
Its funny how the Nigerian woman was like I’m going to win but they both hesitated to touch it
Why they eating it with a fucking spoon
ramen with chicken seasoning pack is good. End of story
I think the woman in the cheetah was just trolling the crap out of everyone. There is no way you can be that bad at cooking ramen
"I like my ramen dry, I don't like the water" bruhhhh, do you even know what ramen is?! It's a SOUP.
black folks brag about their cooking skill but can't make instant ramen 😭
Literally none of these people know how to cook ramen
"I'd prefer my ramen a little dry." oh honey we know
Cheetah print girl pack it up
I can bet you a thousand that just cooking the pasta correctly and adding the seasoning packet that came with it would be better than all of theirs.
Are they eating ramen with... spoons?
Bruh why do none of them have b r o t h? Like what the hell?
If you don’t have a little water in the ramen it’s nasty off bucks
Who doesn’t have water in their ramen? Wtf is wrong with these people
Why is there no broth in any of these Ramen recipes? 😂😂
Olu reading the comments: 👁👄👁                                                   💧       💧
I feel like that girl with the puffy hair has way to much confidence and was a bit salty
“i like mine more dry” okay.....
I don’t like that “olayaisnebshs” girl.
Why are they using spoons 😠
Latinos just put valentina hot sauce and lime and call it a day Maybe some saltines idk whateva you like cuh
Sad how all the “broke” college students are black.
my moms spanish- wtf
Gordon Ramsay: it's raw you donkey!!
how down bad do you have to be to hype up cheap ramen
Why label people as broke that’s mean ngl
And she was so confident that she was going to win and she lives off the bat
"It's salty, are you trying to kill me?!"  The same person, 5 seconds later  "The chicken is the only one that has flavor, season the ramen"  ...what???
I hate that one north African girl my god is she picky
Who eats dry ramen??? It’s literally mush... if y’all don’t like juice then make it a stir fry..... yikes, I think the one with shrimp looked the best hands down,
they need to get some asians to do this LOL
How do you guys make your ramen? 👇🏽👇🏽 I throw in tapatio and lemon 😂
cheetah print really said “It’s so salty omg” then next clip she said there’s no taste????
We likes dry ramen..  Broth is so good with ramen 🍜 🤤
Alr. My opinions. Cheetah print girl, love the enthusiasm but, why does she need to be so full of herself and pick out the little-est things off of the others? Hyping herself so much for her to get a 2 i-. Anyway, the guy. Uhh he's alright tbh. But I mean if it really was flavourless then ig is a lil bad. Then that last girl. I actually love her. She's real honest but nice at the same time. Conclusion, I like that last girl alot
Legend says , due to her affection for dried ramen , she dehydrated it for several days
Isn’t ramen meant to be soupy?
"it has water in it 😰 I prefer mine a little dry ☺️" Ms girl no ramen is supposed to have broth in it wtf LOL
THIS IS SO ME SISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! IM BROKEEEEEEEEE.
please anybody else just wanna knock out that cheetah print girl... she was so confident but lost lol 💀
The cheetah print girl is so judgmental oml I just wanna 🤜👧🐆
“its too salty” 20 secs later “season your ramen”
do they know that ramen is a soup
If this was buzzfeed the title would have Been broke black college kids try each others ramen
as an asian.. this made me cringe. y’all wanna try mine? i’ll show you what’s up
😭😭😭😭 they all have attitude
“ Nigerian style “ ... blood of Jesus on behalf of Nigeria as a country and as a Nigerian we do not claim this dish babygirl prepared AT ALL.
Why they eating it with a SPOOOOONNNN
It’s always the girl taking the most shit just to have some invalid ass ramen
If you are gonna complain about ramen and you’re “broke”, then you can starve 💀
But why are their ramen looks so dead?? Ramen is like orange looking--
I dont want no atagugu in my ramen cuh
that afro girl is a disgrace to nigeria (btw im joking so dont take it personally
2:05 because you’re salty too
The girl with Afro annoyed me😂 acting like hers and saying the other ones are bad. She said it was good, but gave it a 3
wtf does color have to do with it??
hun...its broth. traditional ramen has broth.
My they using spoons
Olu: I like mine a little bit dry Her ramen: Ya DoN't SaY
Ok the girl with the Afro acting like she’s a professional chef and who eats food by the color girl be quiet it’s literally noodles
That voice transformation from the intro to where she introduced herself lmao.0:02-0:25
Can the Ghanaians please take the "Nigerian" away? PLEASE
Why were they using spoons?
none of this shit is ramen, where’s the soup and shit
bruh they do be judging how it looks like, the other girl was talking about the COLOR and how bland it looked- girl this is a broke college student MEAL, as long as it tastes good, who cares if it doesn't look like a five star meal.
😂When you over hype yourself
No one:  The girl saying she will win: I went to last place
the real question is was it bussin
Why are they eating ramen with no broth, that is weird af? I used to put an egg in mine
I put hot sauce Mayo and cheese it’s the best combo in my opinion
My only reaction to the first two is : "where is the broth ???" It's the first time I saw ramen without it 💀
Cheetah print girl annoying as hellllllll.
2:44 "This is just dry" Her later: "I like my ramen dry."
“i don’t like all the water” BRUH THATS LITERALLY WHAT RAMEN IS STFUUU (edit: i know not all people like their ramen with water- HOWEVER, it’s literally in the description of ramen itself, so all i’m saying is don’t get surprised if there’s broth in CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP RAMEN) <3
Best ramen ever hot sauce with grated parmesan cheese best ever 💯💯
“i prefer my ramen more dry” girl we know ..😂
have these kids never heard of BROTH
Dude ramen is supposed to have some type of broth in it, like dude, is just noodles with shit in it😂🤌
Olu was the most boring person in the entire world
"we have remen to save the day" learn to speak
The fact that it’s a normal thing for college students to starve themselves or live on shitty food !! Like this is not normal
y they eating noodles with a spoon
well duh its not stir fried noodles its ramen that why it has water dude yall need some brains
Ramen should be “watery” omg guys
girl ramen... it’s ramen?!?!! ramen is soupy. THERES SUPPOSED TO BE WATER LMAOO
It’s Always The Ones With The Worst Food That Talk The Most Junk😂
Olu was so pretty but her personality is as dry as her ramen
" Its all grey" the fudge- isn't ramen to be that kinda color? do you except to be blue or sum-
Nah, wait- i wanna see olu's reaction when she found out she lost
The cheetah girl rl threw me off, like that is not no Nigerian ramen noodles coming from a Nigerian (Igbo), where is the onions, spice, or even egg?? smh
Ramen is supposed to have broth in it. yeah you can eat it dry if it is your preference, but ramen is a soup.
idk about you but I just get hot water and cook it, then but Tapatio, lemon, and tajin in it and that shit is tasty.
All of those look crusty musty tho😭
“ I DoNt LikE ThE wAteR “  WTF dose she talkin about doesn’t she know that  NOODLES + SOUP = RaMeN
who tf likes dry ramen
U sure that is a RaMeN ??? And why their noodles look like that 😭😭😭srry but eww
It’s always the overly confident ones who end up losing.
Is no one else bothered by them using spoons to eat it💀
Ok but what is (Rah-men) i thought it was (Ray-Men) 🤔i might be slow
Girl wym it’s too watery RAMEN IS SOUP🍜
she was so confident and they obliterated her LMFAOOO
When they
"I prefer my ramen a little more dry" that's why she doesn't cook them!
"My mom is spanish"
My good sis talked all that shit for her noodles to look KRAAAAZYYY😭🤣she woke up and chose triflin 💀
I love how they are all minorities lol
They want to eat ramen or pasta? I'm still not sure.
Does gen z eat ramen with no broth????
YALL THE FACT THAT THEY'RE USING S P O O N S
Lol Olu was really HATING on Cheyanne's Ramen! 🤣🤣🤣
Alternative title: 2 idiots judge each others noodle recipes while one person makes actual ramen
Being an asian, it kinda feels wrong to eat noodles without soup, like if fried noodles it would feel wrong if your mouth werent oily after eating eat, like....do you get it? It feels wrong to eat a DRY noodles without soup or broth?
Are they really eating noodles with a spoon instead of a fork 😐
where the fuck is the broth???
An L for team Naija😔
𝒊𝒕𝒔 𝒔𝒂𝒍𝒕𝒚 girl have you ever had ramen before??
i wanted to see the girls reaction when she found out she got a 2
At the end the cheetah print girl said “next” like thats it 💀
wdym talking bad abt the water ramen is literrallllyyyy supposed to be soup
Who the hell....eats ramen with a SPOOOON?????  I mean the least you could do is to use a fork🙃
curly haired girl is annoying asf
The way he described the picky eaters ramen to spit out crackers.... LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
Ramen is  Suppose to have soup in it  the last one is the only good one
I am african too. when miss girl said she liked dry ramen all I could think is, “just like your life”
Ramen is SOUP it’s supposed to have BROTH and I just wanna scrap with the Nigerian girl she making the Nigerians look bad she gotta go and Ik she’s that annoying person in every class
“broke kids” what? these kids are smart and they are on the verge of graduating big collages why even use those words to describe them?
“It has water in it” babe- you do realize ramen literally is supposed to have broth in it? Y’all yucky asf
NAWW THIS AINT RAMEN LMFAO
I don’t like olu
Bashing water/soup in ramen? Its very obvious they've never had authentic ramen lmao 🤣
I would personally enjoy the WaTeRY oNe no seriously doe
she put bricks in that shit
If u were an actual broke college student u wouldn’t give a shit and ate that bitch
Bruh Olu can't even make ramen! 😭😭😭😭
I’m literally going to go and make some ramen now lol 🍜
Bruh I already knew I hate the girl in the animal print shirt
ramen is supposed to be made with the broth
Cheetah print giving me very much pick me
Marcus is cute as hell
Wait so like you don't eat remen with like sauce?  That's not normal? ... My whole life has been A LIE what about Naruto!? 😶
I hope people realize you aren’t supposed to use your own cultures seasonings for ramen. If you want a more flavour full ramen use the seasoning and sauces from that culture like soy sauce, there’s hoisin sauce there’s fish sauce. I’m not sure about spices. But I know you aren’t supposed to make it with Nigerian spices. Your cultural spices will not taste good with everything Man. Like damn
that cheetah girl needs to stfu
You must be really dumb to struggle while making instant ramen. Also where is the broth?
don't wanna offend anyone but they are so jealous and shady
Remen😂
Where tf is the broth all of those looks like dogshit respectfully
Why tf does the cheetah print girl try to talk like she’s a tv character or sum 😭 annoying as hell
Olu don’t sound broke
Oul don’t sound broke😭
college students: we're BROKE broke also them: puts chicken and shrimp in ramen
I know everyone here mad at the girl who said watery ramen, but...  I like pour my finished ramen in a bowl and put it back in the microwave to purposefully burn it so it’s.... idek I just do it.
I can’t with the girl with the Afro
the cheetah print girl was SO anoying like come on
Ay they hated on the last one with the shrimp  They knew that ish was good
Why are they eating it with spoons 🥄  eat with forks people
I put Taptio in my soup
Just eat it with chile spices it's literally **mwah**
I am literally so confused with Americans... Why do they eat their rice with a fork and eat their noodles with a spoon... Like maybe the producers gave them a spoon but like wut
Its always the worst cooks who critique the most 🙄 her noodles looked like dog food
Why can i hear asians chuckling in the corner of the room-      MAH ASIAN BBS WHERE YALL ATTT
Ramen is Ramen.
AY BRIDGEPORTTT
Lol the girl with the afro got me hyped up thinking she can actually cook.I was wrong
Broke College Kids: "I'm broke so I eat Ramen a lot" Also Broke College Kids: "I threw some shrimp in my ramen"  Bruh moment...
I know damn well that’s not a fuckin spoon
The title💀
The last girls was so good that they didn’t even want to give her good complaints because they talk so much trash
Y’all picked the wrong college kids 😭😭💀
Olu was making me mad😂
I got a grandfather that owns a Raman  shop but yet I still eat cup Raman
I'm convinced these people don't know what actual ramen is.
You can be a broke college kid and still know what broth is 🤔
She's just jelly she didn't come up with it she made me mad I don't like her
Who eats Ramen with a spoon?  Fork or chopsticks is a must(chopsticks preferably).
My moms Spanish...do you mean Mexican
Bruh, they saying “watery” tastes horrible, like MY GUY, I DONT WANT NO NASTY CRUNCH BEHIND BITE
a spoon??
The episode was a shame. Apologize!
Dry ramen.... thats not ramen bro......  I have never heard someone say they  like dry ramen... eat tsukemen without dipping if you want dry "ramen" this video annoyed tf outta me btw. Reminded me of my poor childhood eating over cooked porkchop and dry oodles of noodles as a side cuz my mom was tired from college and job hunting( hard working woman but couldn't cook for sh!t still love her). Instant or not though ramen isn't supposed to be dry or clumpy... college students these days smh
They called the ramen watery, I call it ramen noodle juice. I eat my ramen with juice because I will not be eating dry ramen. 🍜
All of these are foul
Cheetah print girl talking trash but danm she by faaaar had the worst one
Since they don't meet eachother ever start or end they have definitely watched this to see what the others said about their ramen it has 1.6million veiws😂😂😂😂😂
“Broke college kids” lol
Team Nigeria   Go girl 💛💛💛💛
Bitch way to much
“It looks dead” while cheeta girl had a wobbley yellow noodle🌞🌞🌞
Funny how all these people are black and they put *broke college students*
“It has water in it” “The ramens a bit watery”  Yes...that’s what ramen does...has water in it
My 12 year old self can make a better ramen than that monstrosity
2:05 it’s salty  2:24 season the ramen 🤦‍♂️
I think Cheyenne is the best, like who doesn't like the soup of the noodlesssss
Why is she calling her Ramen Nigerian? Please no sis
Not at the cheetah girl saying the guy’s ramen is dry but later saying she prefers her ramen dry,, which one is it sis 🤨🤨
Not the guy acting like his ramen is good when its not🤡
RAMEN IS LITERALLY A SOUP HOW IS IT TOO WATERY??
The way they’re eating it is disgusting. Like why use a spoon for noodles?? 😭
Only the ponytail girl is nice. Why the others annoying as hell😭
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEIR USING SPOONS????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
ISN'T RAMEN SUPPOSED TO BE WATERY? IT'S THE BROTH? THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT?
I love how she’s acting so proud and acting like she has the best one even though she got it 2 lol
the cheetah print girl saying her ramen is “nigerian style ramen” is cap asf, 😭😭 we don’t all cook our ramen like that
Who the fuck eats dry ramen who are u fucken kali muscle
When i was broke in college, adding eggs into ramen is considered fancy already.. this one with shrimp or chicken 😲 really broke meh?
I'm confused, am I eating ramen wrong because I use a fork? 🤔...Nah
as an asian all i can do is close my eyes all through out this vid
everybody’s noodles was dry ...
Bruh I still eat my ramen from microwave with only the packet seasoning it comes with lmao
5:38 yea we can tell 👹🗿👩‍🦯👩‍🦯👩‍🦯
I loved how they left in the "I give this a three , NEXT" WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY THE LAST ONE. xD
The girl with the cheetah print was talking the most stuff but had chunks of ramen
they fr humbled her 😂
why are y'all suppose to be eating ramen dry and not cooked?  stop sending ramen at their country
girl kept complaining   Me: shut up you got a 2 😂😂😂
The ones that run there mouth the most always end up losing and having bad food😂
Is no one gonna talk about how they eat ramen with a SPOON?!
sometimes, overconfidence can really make things get worse
why their ramen so dry tho
alright I was reading the comments before seeing the cheetah girls ramen and I was expecting her to make it like a snack, like the dry noodle snacks. and so I was wondering why everyone was pissed and well.     no I see why.
help why are they eating it with spoons
That’s not Ramon that’s fuckin chips
They were roasting each other
Yo....how tf can u fuck up Ramen😑all u do is add water, boil, add seasoning, then serve....that's it. But then u get people like her..."I like mine dry"...bitch get outta here😤😑
I cook ramen better than these children wtf 🤣
Feel like if It was white people twitter would cancel
“There’s too much salt” “there is no seasoning at all” what
The fact that the girl with the Afro was talking shit and hers was the worst lmaoooo.
Never been to college but I know how to budget a bit. Prices do vary according to location but I live in ohio so I'm going with what I find. Single pack maruchan ramen goes for about .18-.25 cents and it goes for all flavors, so you have variety but let's stick to chicken ramen at .22 cents. Canned corn and canned peas go for about .40-.50 cents and you dont use the whole can for one portion. Split it into fourths so one portion would be about .10-.13 cents. Canned mushrooms are optional but go for about 1 dollar, split it into four and it's about .25 cents per portion. The most expensive thing is the protein in this case chicken. A 3lbs bag of raw frozen tenders go for about 7.50-8 dollars. But you only need 1-2 pieces with is about 4oz on average. That is about 12 portions per bag and about .67 cents per portion. So for one meal you are spending around 1.27 each. As a grocery list you will spend a total of about $14-17 before taxes because you will need 12 packs of ramen, 3 cans each of corn and peas, 3 cans of mushrooms optional, and a 3lbs bag of frozen chicken tenders.
Ok stuck on the “my mom is Spanish” part
Gurl be like: ma ramen is gonna be the best,  it's gonna win Gurl loses lol
If you can afford chicken and shrimp while calling yourself broke , you're not broke enough
Omfg she starts crying
Whyyyy this cheetah girl saying there no color and it look dead !!!! It literally ramen 🤦‍♀️
Bro ramen is supposed to have broth
Cant really relate
They taking about it needs more of this it needs more of that. Totally lost it when it needs for shrimp was said. This isn't a cookout challenge with unlimited resources of ingredients and money. It's broke college food.
They call that ramen?
none of them have barely any broth wtf 💀💀
The Afro girl pisses me off she’s not it annoying asf
Am i the only one that just.... Eats it normally?? Maybe I'll save some to use as a crunchy garnish or sometimes lime half but i dont have a whole ass recipe
Save a little bit and crunch it up to use as garnish (yes from b99) squeeze lime half into bowl, not that hard why are yall trying to be so extra???
"This is salty! *cries* ARE U TRYING TO KILL ME?!" Lmfao
Alternate title "We gathered the most basic college students imaginable and made them eat ramen because its relatable"
Damn i make better ramen than all the people at 13
I’m sorry but are we not gonna talk about how that one girl with the braids was like “ My moms Spanish” 😂 she’s a language? And then we got ole cheetah print girl with clumps in her ramen. Marcus funny ash tho lol
LMAOOOOO NOT THE CHEETAH GIRL LIKING HER RAMON BARELY COOKED- BBG WTF COME ON NOW😭
Why are they all using a spoon to eat RAMEN 💀💀
This video somehow gives 90's disney character vibes
This should be called: college students realise how horrible 2 minute ramen actually is
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BROTH. A SOUP. THAT'S Y ITS RAMEN.
this shit like a disgrace to asians fucking the water is the soup which you eat with the noodles
Wait because only the last ramen looks decent....
The  Nigerian girl got what she deserved ngl
Is Hispanics after hearing them say it’s watery: uhm it’s supposed to be a soup so off it’s gonna be watery, it needs broth now if you Asian I’m pretty sure they eat it without water and don’t get me wrong I like them both ways but I grew up eating it with the broth and everything with some Valentina sauce or tapatio and some lime
“I prefer my ramen dry” good luck on cooking for ur kids
"it looks gray"
I’m sorry but y’all just eating diff flavored spaghetti 💀 like “ramen noodles” is a soup, where’s the water at? Why they so dry 💀
nobody:   me: are they eating ramen with a spoon?
omg ramen without broth is not ramen 😌 can't relate to people who like it dry 👁️👄👁️
“I would prefer my Raman a little bit more dry” Lol girl we knw, that’s why u got a 2
Fill that damn bowl with water. It is a ✨ *_s o u p_* ✨
The Nigerian girl was acting like her shit was bout to be bussin
PLEASE THE GIRL IN THE CHEETAH IS LITERALLY A PICK ME GIRL
broo it's just ramen. crazy how they took the rating seriously like!? also no offense to them, but instant ramen like ones that came straight out of a packet or a cup looks and probably tastes so much better.
I would pay to see the reaction video of them watching this video.
"I don't mean to be mean, but..." then proceeds to be utterly rude with "mine actually has flavor"
Ok then since the ramen too dry then just eat one of those packet ramens dry
Bouta make a prison spread for them
“I like mine a little dry” A LITTLE ???
y'all i dont understand this americans, ramen is supposed to be with water or soup whatever you call it. y'all just want noodles not ramen. argh
omg the girl with the afro needs to fr stfu just hearing her talk makes me so mad 💀
Where is the broth though 😩
ITS A MF SOUP. ITS BROTH NOT WATER. HUH?
2:04 says its salty  Minuets later: says it underseasoned
Dude the girl with the cheetah shirt was just pissing me off the entire time
Cheeta girl makes upset😭😭😂
Cheetah girl was real life making me mad 😭✋🏾 how u so cocky just for urs to be the worst & it’s the fact u can tell she knew the other 2 where better so she was in ha bag & was giving them low scores 👩🏾‍🦯
Cheeta girl gotta big head😂😂😂😂
I could make better ramen than all these people
Thats what cheetah girl gets for being tooooo cocky her ramen chunky like doo doo
As someone who was raised in an asian family and cooked ramen for a majority of my life I would just like to say....  Wtf is that?
Dat girl did all day talking about the other people food...AND SHE GOT A 2🤣😑
not the girl with the afro saying all that shit about marcus's ramen being salty then calling it flavorless, hun please
WHY ARE YOU EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON????
Olu thought she wa the main character 😭😂
“Its so salty” “Theres no seasoning” Which one is it bruh
“The Ramen is watery.”  The instructions literally say you need 2 cups of water in a bowl or to fill up the damn cup. Tf Cheetah Print and Erkel be talking about???
My sister can cook better ramen than all of them and she’s only 5
ramen is supposed to have like broth it ain’t supposed to be dry💀.
I honestly feel like they all wanted to just tear each other down the opinions weren't really accurate on any side
Crushed chili ramen. Crushed flamin hot cheetos. Cheese. Add to ramen bag add water bout half way up the pile. Mix. Roll up let sit 10 min. Eat like a burrito. Your welcome.
the girl with the afro needed to be humbled-
The instant ramen hack that will change your life is sesame oil. SESAME OIL! If you prefer it as a stir-fry, stir-fry it in sesame oil. You prefer a nice broth, add sesame oil. Want to add some onion or other veggies? Sautee them in sesame oil before adding your water and noodles. It elevates the "struggle" ramen to "look ma, I'm an adult" ramen. Also, if you really broke then all you have is an egg, no shrimp/chicken. But don't sleep on the egg. Fry it/Boil it and watch it transform your noodles into ramen. 🤣
Olu rude af that’s why yo noodles dry as hell.😭
All of those ramens are absolute trash. I can’t stand people who cook their ramen like this. There’s supposed to be a broth like wtf. Ramen shouldn’t be dry. Smh can’t even cook instant ramen right.
nobody gonna talk about the title ?
The word broke  in the title .... makes me feel bad
This is fancy ramennnn I leave it with just the packet hot water and whatever the packet gives me for flavor
That’s why I’m not going to college. Because debt..
Can we all agree that they all cooked it horribly??
The African girl is annoying asf
Miss girl-  😭😭😭
I’m so glad Afro chick had the worst she pissed me off from the start
Y’all could not pay me to eat that-  I’m sorry 🤡💀
Olu is uhh funny
bruh all their ramen looked dry,overcooked and cold
i don't think any of the contestants are in the place to judge others. tbh all their ramens equally look... unappetizing.
Its always the one that talks bs about other ppl food and yet their own wack asf....cheetah girl
“Season the ramen!”  *literally complains about it being salty*
Couldn’t afford the water
“watery”....ramen....is supposed....to have broth.....

Wait do people not eat ramen with the broth??
Afro girl was a bit stuck up and low key full of herself, and the other girl is just so chill
“It has no color” Sis, ramen aint for painting.
That girl with the cheetah print looks like she got the noodles straight out the packet and microwaved it with a bit of cold water
All three of them were irritating as FUCK!! Srry to this man
Who the fuck makes ramen and drains the broth out? 🙃
as an asian watching this, what do you mean "watery" ramens are supposed to have BROTH, it's not pancit canton plsss
This has me questioning whether I’m making/eating my ramen wrong? I always have my noodles in a chicken broth? How is it weird that it has water in it? Lol and eating them dry and crunchy with a sprinkle of the powder flavoring is 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
home girl representing UCR!!! go highlanders!!
Broke? Bruh I guess 100 dollar nails and makeup is cheap
The cheetah girl first said it was salty and then changed it to say it had no flavor like huh 😂
wait is it me or people don’t eat their ramen with their broth? even if it’s instant ramen I don’t drain the broth

Bruh dude sounds dumb asf mozzarella cheese in ramen is fire
Where's the red pepper flakes??
She said shut out to the shrimp that save the day.🤣😂
That girl in the cheetah print is a natural born hater lol
i think they're forgetting that they're BROKE college students
why are people so surprised that ramen, a literal SOUP, has water in it 💀
I never realized how broke I was until I realized my “special ingredient” is water and an egg if it’s a holiday lmao
Why do they eat the ramen with a spoon. At least use a fork lol
Really thought he was gone say “they went wrong by waking up” 😭
I honestly feel bad for students who have to pay to get to college in here its the other way around college provides you with a room and it gives you minimum 270$ each month
Dude the cheetah print girl really said "coming in with a different vibe" yea we know, your Ramen aint even Ramen. Its clumps of uncooked noodles
Cheetah girl’s ramen deadass looks more underdone than a living creature. 💀
Why the most annoying people always loose in this series
Add color to the ramen bruh?
Are you not supposed to leave the soup in it? And drink it?
“I don’t like all the water” ... have y’all ever seen actual ramen?????
Why are all their ramens dry as hell WHERES THE SOUP
Why are they eating noodles with a spoon?
how to make instant ramen: 1. You boil water???!! 2. You add the ramen and cook for 4 mins?? 3. You add the flavor packet. 4. You eat it. Not that hard.
*YOU NEED THE BROTH IN RAMEN TO MAKE IT GOOD*
Cheetah Print Girl: My ramen is the best. I’m gonna win. Other contestants: ***proceeds to say why her ramen sucks***
i wouldnt trust someone that says remen to give me tips on how to cook
This is ridiculous! All the dishes look the same. And taste the same. And they are criticizing each other’s “dishes”. When it was a premade food.
All their ramen look trash, where the asian student's at??
Them talking like their ramen is like Gourmet is so funny i actually cant handle is HAHAHAHA
WHERE IS THE *SOUP*
someone tell the cheetah print girl to stfu LMAO
They don’t know what real ramen is
u den have to call them broke tho bc i bet it just go show black kids and prob one white
Why they eating they ramen with a spoon 😭
“Look it’s a clump” 💀
Girlll all they ramen looked nasty omg
You ever just wanna 🤜🐆👩🏾‍🦱
... You use a spoon to eat ramen???
Why they calling the broth “water” you need that broth 😭😭
ramen is supposed to be soupy 😩
why they all have attitudes damn
they all looked dry 😐 .. disgusting lmao
Ramen is supposed to have that water on the bottom lmao if you want dry noodles eat normal pasta
Annoying Afro girl: “I prefer mine a little more dry”  Me: Yeah we know
lol y'all supposed to be broke, im sure it won't have a lot of shrimp.
Do you are telling me you don’t eat your ramen with the soup in it??
idk why but i feel like the cheetah girl have super low scores bc she knew hers was bad 💀
“My mom’s Spanish” I didn’t know a language was a race👀
Ramen is a soup: and the emojis can prove it: 🍜... Ramen needs broth, it shouldn’t be dry lol
Cheetah chick hella annoying like bro her ramen look like my aunts ashes
Oluwamayowa is a lil narcissistic-
ITS SOUP WHAT DO YOU DONT LIKE IT DRY It’s soup
The fact that they hated the broth ramen because it was watery and ended up loving it but intentionally gave it a bad score cause they didn't wanna hurt their ego😩
The fact that they were supposed to make a broke college ramen and Cheyenne busted out the oyster sauce, sriracha, and shrimps! How you putting $10 of accessories on 50 cents of ramen?!
not me eatin ramen while watching..
The cheetah girl was getting on my nerves
Who eats dry Ramen? I am trying to figure out why some of them like it dry. 😂😂😂
The girl with the braids carried this, shout out to her, and the dude. Very mature and kind. The last girl was wayyyy to cocky and confident
Wtf is a anagongon 😭😂
The girls with the braids looked the best cause who tf eats ramen dry like what
Nani?!?!?
Olu wanted to win so bad. Thats so funny. Girl was trashing the other ramen flavors when hers came in last.
Y’all add your own seasonings? I just grab the ones that are given to me
Cheyenne's was the only one that actually looked like how ramen should, the first two I was thinking why there's looks so dry especially, especially once I seen the clumps of ramen 🤢   Edit: they need to bring me on the show I can throw down in the kitchen, I post pics of my food all the time on IG
Funniest video Ive ever seen xD
I just put salt and lime in mine also why is theirs so dry it has no juice lol
Why are they making them try to eat noodles with a spoon😂😂 like ik it’s supposed to be soupy but it’s NOODLES
Olu is so pretty but that RAMEN AINT
I swear he sounds like faze rug
Please for the love of god stop being stupid ass fools on this show 😭😭
"This Ramen Has Water In It" - Cheetah Girl 2021 -
This boy don't like no one's ramen and he thinks his was the best I mean it was ok
“i prefer my ramen dry 😌”  yes sis its giving very much crunchy sticks in the woods vibes 😫☺️

My Ramon is made with, soy sauce, and Sriracha.
so we can all agree cheetah print girl is kinda irritating
why doesn’t any of their ramen have broth                    👁💧👄💧👁
I would simply just put Tapitio and lemon
BAHAHA i love how the cheetah girl was given tips and said hers was the best and NO ONE liked hers SKKDKDFHDJF
" My mOM's SpaNISh" XD
I’d just give them raw because that’s how I eat it-
this kinda pained me to watch
Where did they find these people who don't eat their ramen with an optimal amount of broth.
5:39 how dry girll
1. There’s literally no broth  2. SPOONS?
Isn't ramen supposed to be in it's water....like, I've always had it in its own water and added what i like, with of course, the egg on top. I just never saw someone eat it without liquid-
cheetah print girl was talking way too much for those dry clumps of noodles she gave to them. She should be ashamed.
omfg thats girl pisses me offff omg ahh
i really was questioning whether or not im supposed to eat Ramen with water or not after watching it video 😔✋🏾
African girl annoying asf
Nooo the cheetah girl is killing me 😭😂
The cheetah girl smh 🤣 mean while hers was disgusting 🤣

olu girl def liked cheyenne's ramen but is too cocky to admit it lmao. besides cheys' ramen the other two peoples ramens didn't even have any broth like wah? yall that broke ya cant use water?
the cheap instant ramen is supposed to have broth lmaooo
Do they not know ramen has to have liquid?
Isnt ramen usually watery?
Bro this ain't ramen no more it's just seasoned noodles
I was only 2 mins into the video and the girl with the Cheetah shirt was getting on my nerves. She was very annoying give me very much erky🤚🏾
It’s alway the most critical person who has the worst food
i really wish i was there tbh. and the fact theres so broth pisses me off.

All the Ramen looks bad. What kind of ramen are they buying omg I’m sorry.
Mfs really hated on Cheyenne for having soup?? It literally wouldn’t even be ramen without soup. It’d be yakisoba wtf.

All that shit look dry asf hell nah 🤣
the cheetah girl didn’t like anyone’s ramen but hers 😭 she didn’t even tryyy
cheetah girl way too critical. leave girl
bro why u give em spoons just for noodles lol
What is the point of ramen when there is no soup. Cheyennes's ramen looks way better than the others. the others it was just plain noodles.
No vegetables? No meat? No egg? Nothing? Garnish? You all are not that broke.
Dude, y’all can’t even make ramen.
Maggi be like am i a joke to you?
why is everyone ignoring the fact they ate ramen with a SPOON 😃
Are they stupid ramen is a SOUP why are they complaining about the broth that's what the seasoning packet it for
Ayy Cheyenne my sisters name lol
The fact that the cheetah print girl had clumps as her Ramen and decided to give advice is what sends me
wtf??? buy some korean ramen OMG these look dry AF
Y’all need to drop Cheyenne’s @ 👀😂
I would win this without a doubt
the crazy part is they talk about how they like no water but the water is the flavor 💀
Not me who ate my ramen uncooked as a snack when I was younger —

They didn't hesitate to go in on the cheetah girl😂😂😂
Please ramen is supposed to have broth in itttt it rfvsog.

nigerian girl is buggin lmaooooo
The fact that they don’t like broth in their ramen already tells me that they know nothing about ramen. It’s traditionally supposed to have broth... 😂
#ramenlivesmatter
the cheetah girl is so pretty, but when people who are pretty are salty af

Tell me you don't know what broth is without telling me you don't know what broth is
The Cheetah print girl: “I like my Ramen dry “ Me: so u like yo chicken dry?

Almost 8 minutes of 3 people eating Ramen with a spoon

The cheetah girl over dramatic when she said “are you trying to kill me”
girl... she really hyped up her ramen... IT'S FRICKIN' *CRUNCHY* !?!? CRUNCHY??? *so much disappointment... too much disappointment* also... I don't think they know what ramen actually is except the girl whose had broth :')
I can't be the only one who like a little over cooked noodles right? .......But a lot of broth lol
I love how the people who are super arrogant about their food always have the most disgusting shit lmao
The way Olu was so confident and then their reaction said “no” all over the place it was hilarious.
The girl with the cheetah print is soooo rude,for someone who's food looks so nasty she genuinely had no right 💅🏻
The AUDACITY of that cheetah girl . Plus ramen IS suppose to be soupy to start with? Ask the Asian broke college students to make the right ramen.
I really wanna see the cheetah girls reaction of her seeing she got a 2
I think the girl in the cheetah shirt just wants to win so she’s hating on every one else😂
Aren’t you supposed to eat it with broth like that is just noodles with seasoning
Um why the hell all they ramen dry as hell
Girl ramen is supposed to have broth soup
Im younger and cook wayyy much better ramen then the adults i was expecting more you know you disappointed a 13 year old today man.
The first guys Ramen looked like it was bussin 😫
Alright, Beef Ramen with tiger sauce 🤤🤤
Why was Olu so shitty to everyone🤨
The one talking the most smack made the worst lol
If you're gonna eat it dry, might as well just get the chunk out and eat it raw
Ramen is a soup! Not pasta
Do these guys know ramen got broth with it... it’s not supposed to be so dry
I cam too watch how too cool ramen a different way cuz that’s all I got too eat at the house how I end up here 😀
The big question is why tf they eating noodles with a spoon
It’s always the one talking the most shit with the worst food
WHY ARE THEY EATING IT WITH A SPOON COULD THEY NOT FIND A FORK!!!!!
i have never seen anybody cook ramen like this
PLS MINE MAY BE NOT GOOD BUT THEY DRYYYYY LIKE WHATT IK YALL BROKE BUT ME TOO AND I USE TOP RAMEN CHICKEN FLAVORED RAMEN PUT SOME LIME AND VALENTINA AND ANOTHER REALLY SPICY SAUCE AND ITS BUSSIN LIKE THAT IS LIKE NOT EVEN RAMEN 🤢🤮[THEIR RAMEN] LIKE PLS WHERES THE SOUPPPP
Those 2 should google Ramen before doing this
me being asian and seeing the two without broth scared the shit out of me like how is that ramen 💀💀
“i like mine a little dry” GURL- PLEASEEEE-
That olu girl said hers was the best but she was in last
5:37 we saw that
yall eat ramen DRY????? oh no bby
I’m really scared rn like people actually eat dry ramen without the soup I- like NOOO THE CLUMPS OF DRY NOODLES AND THE DRY NOODLESSSS And also eating with a spoon.....
i’m so confused why do they keep acting like they’ve never seen broth before😭
I have never ate ramen 😐
“Ts look dry ash” omg😭😭😭
That girl was coming with all the smoke just to lose 😂 EMBARRASSING
Y’all are dumb. What she meant by her ramen being watery is that she doesn’t like a whole lot of water. That’s how I prefer my noodles as well I don’t like a whole lot of water & not a very dry. My noodles are more so creamy than either or.
The cheetah girl was pissing me off
This video got my dislike
It’s the broth not water 😭🤚🏽
that cheetah girl is such an overconfident brat
Man all 3 of them don't know how to make Ramen. What is thisssss???? 😭😭😭😭 The disrespect.  The third one, they tripping about the too watery - you supoosed to have broth. You want color? Chuck some green onions or something. But all 3 need to eat some real Ramen somewhere.
someone get them ramen from the local asian supermarket and not 7/11 😭😭
it has water in it which is ok...ig  me: LITERALLY IT IS A SOUP JBDXWRTJNDG
Olu was a hater and no one liked hers 😭😭
Everyone is talking about the cheetah girl, but the guy was annoying as her cuz' he is complaining about the broth of the ramen. He even said " Idk if I could eat this" like dude stop making a thing about the broth.
“The ramen is watery” wtf do they not eat ramen with broth?!?!? They both made their ramen dry. I’m confused am I the only person who eats ramen with broth?!?  Edit: I can’t spell
The dude's was the best, i feel like they all sucked. You gotta get that shin ramen and cook it, then drain the water and put in some of the seasoning packet, and then put some cheese on that boi. mmmmh
why did they give them spoooooons who eats ramen with spoons????
Am i the only one who doesn't eat the noodles- i only drink the soup- I- okay bye
LOL she said its salty than said the ramen had no flavor
The last girl is the only one that know how to cook ramen tbh ( my opinion)
She said there's no colour... Bro if I'm without funds. I'm not worried about colour I'm trying to SURVIVE kid!
Them noodles dry
These people mean
Where the juice at tho?
“ThE raMen l0oks wAteRy” 🥴🥴🥴.... Um... it’s broth?
the cheetah girl a bitch ngl
Ok- but why a SPOON👁👄👁😩
It’s always the ppl with the most criticism and have the most to say about everyone else’s dishes that be horrible😂
My ramen is fabulous. I’m only good at making chicken ramen and beef😭
girl... im not even allowed to boil mine and i can make ramen 1000x better, Japanese culture is screaming.
They are reviewing this ramen like gordan Ramsey reviewing a 5 star specialty fine dine diner made buy jesus him self
cheetah print actin like her ramen a gourmet meal when that shit was a chip
Olu: my noodles have a different vibe Cheyenne: im getting like my mom vibes        Marcus: 👁👄👁 these are pretty good ya know           Marcus 2min later: this sh*t look dry as hell
I’m so confused as to why the other people were mad at the ramen having soup? ITS LITERALLY NOODLES, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT.
Mrs.cheetah girl was really trying to give tips too🤣
THE CURLY HAIR GIRL IS SUCH A MEME PLEASEEEE😭
Cheetah girl: I like my ramen a little more dry. Looking disgusted with it   Sis we can tell
Everybody makes their Ramen different, but it's funny to see how much pride those people had in their Ramen.      I like a lot of juice so much more than the third girl had in her Ramen and I've been told I over cook my noodles. I only add a little bit of salt to bring out the flavor. so all of their noodles look disgusting to me. I literally can't eat noodles any other way, I've tried and I can't.
How hard is it to make ramen all that shit look nasty 😂😂😂
Ramen dryer than my dms
Cheetah print bish gave tips but all she knows is her crayfish and whatever the fuck the other thing was lmao
Bruhhhh...where's the broth?..😭😭 Struggle meal for real
Biased lol
Asian people are looking at this like🤦🤦🤦 if you want to save money just eat rice with eggs with soy sauce on top
is it just me or does the cheetah shirt girl piss me off??
Wtf do you mean "watery?" It's soup, and that is called broth. Where do they find these people?
All they ramen is gross
Why the cheetah girl talking her ramen is dry as hell and NO DAMN SEASONING
she talkin smack and now she losing 😂
Broke black people
Why don’t they have any soup in their ramen lmao super dry
Why you eat ramen with a spoon
SHRIMP IS DIARRHEA
I make my ramen bomb!!!!🍜🍜
imagine cheetah girl goes to japan and all the noodles she sees have soup
Cheetah girl has to be trolling.......
I like my noodles just how the last one made it ...with water in it .I hate dry noodles
Cheyenne: “I threw some shrimp in there 😍🍤”       Me seeing 1 piece of shrimp 😓🍤✨
The girl with the cheetah printed shirt got on my nerves like I can’t
Dont these people know what ramen is... They complaining that theres broth
ITS SUPPOSE TO HAVE SOUP lmao
I’m starting to wonder, are they saying it’s too watery, because it doesn’t have a flavor? Like does it just taste like pasta water? Because if that’s the case, I can understand the comments.
If you actually look ramen up, it’s noodles in a broth. These shouldn’t be called ramen except for the last one since it has a bit of soup, so I personally think it’s an exception but the rest of them are dry. They aren’t called ramen, just dried noodles. Simple as that.
ramen is supposed to have the broth that's part of the meal, ramen without the broth is like a hotdog without the bun
These kids have no idea what ramen actually is because ramen is literally has a broth soup base and they are either dry or either a tiny bit of water and they are freaking out that it has a little bit of water
Cheyenne ramen looks good the other 2 looks dry and nasty
She talkin all thatttt 😂
I know why I wouldn't make it on one of these competition cooking shows. I'm not catty enough man. I'd rather compliment someone's cooking even if I don't like it rather than tear it down because ya'll... I'm so fucking tired of tearing each other down. Why can't we lift ourselves up without putting other people down? I'd love to try all of these. I'm going to make them myself.
Y'all this is crazy how are you not using the broth for your ramen? I'd you are adding stuff them adds lot of it to be filling ex. Egg, chicken, mushroom, leek, sprouts
That girl with the cheetah print is bugging me so bad
Please tell me this is scripted🤣
“LOOK, ITS A CLUMP! 🙄🤔😐😂😂😂”
Where.  Is. THE BROTH!?!?!?
Olu sis! Don't add nothing to nothing lol
i hope you guys gave them a bit of money for scool
Who tf eats ramen with spoons
I think the combined toxicity of all these contestants affected all their noodles.
Who tf put the cheetah girl on this show she’s so annoying
They should have been allowed to make it fresh. If they’re bringing it from home of course it’s gonna be dry
The first two cannot cook for shit😭 like theirs was dry asf and the girl in the print had the worst and had some neeeeerve💀
So sad I can't show them what's what smh
I would blow there ramen out the fucking park my ramen taste like gods food
Cheetah girl can't cook for shit.
Olu was soooo confident 😭😭😭
*First of all* , them eating cold soggy ramen and not ones made instantly OFFENDS ME. 😭
why are they acting like ramen isn't supposed to be served with the broth LMAOO
The African one got violated
Bro what do u mean?? Ramen is supposed to be watery!
Am the only one who see’s unseasoned ramen 💀💀💀
Nigeria
Me, an asian: How tf do you mess this up so badly. It's just,,,,noodles,,,and water,,,,,  If you're a poor college student with ramen, I'ma just say this- add eggs. Just crack em in there (after letting the noodles boil and soften), and let them boil until the white cooks, and there is a solid membrane around the yolk. Although it depends on preference-- I like a more liquid yolk, so I only cook it til I feel the membrane. If you cook it too long you won't have a liquid yolk. And yes you will know if you have a liquid yolk in the membrane, bc it will be still squishy when poked with a spoon.  This will make your ramen taste a lot better imo. You can also add beef, pork, or chicken as well.
This is lame
:( their being really critical I think the third girl’s ramen looked and would taste the best
tbf olu was a bit sassy...!!!
Why is the first 2 ramens dry??? Where's the juice at?? And WHY are some of them eating noodles with a spoon. Lord help me.
The cheetah print girl is so toxic and so full of herself 🙄 as if her Ramen wasn't drier than a desert
When i first saw the title of the video “Broke” i died laughing 😂😂😂
I’d like to try the Nigerian girls ramen
Now I'm confused if the Ramen I am making with broth is actually wrong
Cheetah girl pissed me off differentttttt 😂
She was so confident bro
sis ramen lives matter 😩
HOW THEY EATIN IT WITH A SPOON
I thought you were supposed to have liquid. Ramen is traditionally soup anyways
i fucking hate that cheeta girl man
they’re annoying full offense
The cheetah girl pissing me off😭😭😂 then she got the nerve to talk about her noodles like she killed the game
THAT'S NOT JUST WATER, THATS SOUP... BECAUSE ITS  R A M E N,  ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOUP
Im sry but my latinas and latinos be making the best ramen with that lime and that hot sauce sry idk how to spell it but u know wht i mean.. But hands down best ramen made comes from asians bc they can build u a fancy noodle bowl in mins and even if u have not so much add ins they come up with the best...
The cheetah girl first: it’s really salty. Are y’all tryna kill me? 20 sec later: It DoEsNt hAve FlaVor. ThE onLy ThInG tHat hAs fLavoR is The ChicKen. Uhm miss girl?
a trend I see is the one that has the most to say ends up being the one with the worst LMAO
Cheetah print girl got mad at the guys ramen and said hers was the best...GIRL YOURS WAS DRY AND UNDERCOOKED

The cheetah girl makes my blood boil
Where's the color! When they look fat that means they are overcooked.
i love how the girl with the afro says ramen
Why they being so shady to the others it's literally a 1 dollar ramen competition
That one dude was really chill can I have his @ or something I gotta follow 🤣
Where’s the water and chopsticks or at least use a fork using a spoon just looked wrong

"I don't like all the water" boy have you ever had REAL ramen?
" Is that hay"🤣🤣
I never thought I d dislike 2/3 people in a room 💀 cheyenne, girl, get outta there fast
It’s always the ones who think they dish the best who plate be the worse lol
Ramen suppose to have broth lol 😂 Cheyenne’s looks the best
wdym ppl eat their ramen dry dry 🧍🏻‍♂️
afro girl is annoying asf
Something about Oui's personality seems off, kinda like they told her to act like that
where tf is there broth 😭😭
why does it need color?
Bro where's the broth??????????
As a Nigerian myself, we don't claim her
The cheetah girl was so damn confident that she thinks she was going to win and so judgy lmao plus her ramen was so shit and dry, she even got the lowest score
Where’s the broth??
Has any of them just thought of making normal ramen no extra shit. All you have to do is just cook it and it will win.  Normal ramen beats fancy ramen
i make the best ramen man
but where’s the soup based ramen
1. Who the hell eats it with a spoon 2. The water makes it taste better. Dry noodles are just terrible And last. HOW THE FUCK IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY RAMEN WRONG THE GIRL WITH THE WACK ASS CHEETAH OUTFIT AT THE START DONT EVER AGAIN PICK UP RAMEN NOODLES ANYMORE IN YOUR LIFE.
i can't believe they don't put water.....
the cheetah girl was so confident 🚶‍♂️
why are the noodles raw with no soup
It’s genuinely tragic that none of them apart from Cheyenne know how to make ramen tf
Broke???😂😂😂😭😭
THE RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATErRrrRr
y'all dumb asf blasting them for blasting the "wet" ramen, yea ramen has soup, but not some half ass puddle in the bowl. and this is instant ramen. dry instant ramen is a thing.
Puts broke in the title everyone in the video is black what in the racist
the ones who talk smack are the ones who present the worst 😂
So am I the only person that eats ramen with the water and I don't season it I use the pack season they come with🏃‍♀️
I know they did not just say it’s too watery 💀
I would be so embarrassed to be the cheetah girl
so like they dont have instant ramen or what?
The broth is the best part wtf...
ok but don’t they use the spicy sauce for the RAMENNN??!!! cause it’s not ramen if it don’t have that typical ramen sauce 😔
it’s watery? do you eat chicken noodle soup dry?
but ramen is supposed to have soup...
i like mine with like barley any water like a tea spoon of water in it with the noodles soft with hot sauce and the favor packet i keep like a teaspoon of water in for it’ll mix evenly
ur broke wdym add shrimp 🤨
Olu is so pretty.
The two is ignorant. Ramen has water you know, you need to cook it by hot water. Yakisoba or a canton is a dried ramen duh.
They can't cook ramen for shit
The girl in cheetah print: “I like my ramen dry”  Everyone else: girl we know😩
to Leopard print girl sayibg she liked her Ramen dry, twas very evudent if i do say so myself
Yall should just call it noodles at this point, its called ramen because its noodles with a broth, thats why youre given a soup base seasoning in the first place
Cheyenne was so sweet 🥰
The crowded kevin orly hang because apparel isely judge alongside a straight day. short, overt diving
my ramen looks like a 9 course meal compared to those depressing bowls of silly bands and lost hope
How do college kids have time to do anything but boil the shit? Lmfao
Can y’all like pls, I know when they made these dishes they were broke college students but like pls cook ur ramen properly like two of them barely even had soup and like I know the one girl had soup but might as well not even have any in the first place ALSO EAT WITH CHOPSTICKS OR A FORK AND NOT JUST A SPOON ITS NOT THAT HARD
Thats not ramen thats noodles ;)
Why tf isn't there water!!!?!!!!???
what abt all the white broke kids lol
i’m sorry but the cheetah girl is pissing me tf off and i’m only like three minutes into the video
Broke gang!
The spiteful invention morphometrically bury because submarine descriptively stay barring a lewd zoo. ripe, breezy fridge

For broke college kids, they sure are bougie
1:51 "They added chicken to it so that's G- A different spin" PLSSS 😭🤚
Anyone else feeling like the contestants ramen was too fancy! What happened to just adding water, the packet, and hot sauce or soy sauce? 😂😂😂
I can hear my fellow asians laughing  *You call that A RAMEN?*
All of these collage students have no idea how cook and are lying to themselves about what they are eating .

This girl really said “this ramen has water in it” like ramen isn’t suppose to be in soup 🍜 💀
Wow....uneducated college students dont even know wat ramen is. Too watery? For real?!
Do they not know ramen is suppose to have broth 🤣
College students: bashing the ramen  Me: my hungry a$$ salivating
In my country we call it  InDoMIe
Broke but choosy..  Go figure
HOW DO U FUCK UP RAMEN
This ain't "broke" college students, this is just college students eating ramen. Cause I know for a fact I had nothing to even put in my ramen to "make it fancy". They splurging out here with chicken, shrimp, and spices! 😤
Cheetah print girl reminds me of 'where's the flavour' cassandra
yall her mom is Spanish
Why did you give them spoons
It’s always the one who thinks their dish is the best, who has the worst dish 😂😂😂
How tf are they college students
Why are they eating with spoons
Okay but y’all haven’t tried my ramen
Ramen has to have soup, if it doesn't have soup, it's not ramen. Y'all, don't massacre a delicious dish! That's called instant noodles, not ramen!
I knew by how she was judging the other ones hers was gonna be bad lmao
the cheetah print girl watching this and reading the commentc like :👁👄👁
Why was this video even uploaded omg all of the kids are annoying..
marcus is such a mood omfg
There’s stir fry noodles (which is dry with no water) and we have the ramen noodles soup 🍜🥺🙂
cheetah girl saying her ramen is superior and nobody likes it 😭😭🤚
Me who grow up eating authentic ramen because of my families culture: what is this shit. If i gave that to my mom she would throw slipper
How did yall make ur own ramen😭i simply open the packet and they gave free seasonings💀💀
who ever is reading thsi god bless you and please spread the word of god please.
Yep the non cheeta print girl deserved it cause hey at least it had soup or broth or whatever it’s called
The cheetah grl not annoying but kinda.The boy good since of humor and funny and the girl in black shirt nice pretty and not very picky in my opinion.👍
TBH, I make better broke ramen than the ones they made oop
How dare she make soup wet.
I Don't know if they were bashing each other on purpose or not.
“**my moms Spanish**” please I new she meant mexican but that’s just funny to me   And then she said “**this is just dry**” you don’t like ur ramen juicy ?   And it triggers me that they’re eating it with spoons fr💀  But all jokes lol. This video is very funny please😩😩😩☝️☝️
have I been making ramen wrong or are these people weird
Why the African girl so rude like girl stop!
Who else went straight to the comments when cheetah girl said she preferences her ramon dry💀🤚🏽
Me being an asian freaking out cuz they said what ? That the ramen had too much water ?  I’m sorry , but do they notice that ramen is water and noodles ?
6:03 I feel like she didn't wanna say it was good because she wanted to win 💀💀💀
Ngl I kinda wanted to see the cheetah print girl's reaction when they told her she lost-
literally none if this is ramen, get ur shit together;...
Theyve never had real miso
Homegirl with the fro was mad annoying
They realize that ramen isn’t supposed to be dry- BYE- it’s Japanese culture and is originally soupy or you could say like pho
The shit that these people did to ramen is disgraceful on every level. If you wanna make instant ramen better you use some chicken, egg, nari, dashi and some chilli oil. Not whatever these people did
Whhyyyyyyy do i feel embarrassed right now yalll 😭✋🏾she did not just say why is the ramen wet
Why are they eating it with spoons
How are these people so preppy about ramen
they call themselves "broke college students" but critique the lack of shrimp, lack of color, and the broth in INSTANT RAMEN. a bunch of wack ass liars😖
people actually eat ramen without the soup?? that’s like the best part
The creepy journey ultrasonographically box because george considerably cough upon a amusing scent. safe, naughty leaf
The woman with the most opinions had the worst ramen
Why are they using spoons?
Am I the only person here who eats my ramen with the water or
The cheetah print girl has such a robotic attitude😭 but like also, who tf eats their ramen WITH A SPOON??
That Nigerian accent is something I didn’t know I needed in my life
“This has water in it so it’s ok, I guess. I prefer my ramen a bit dry”   *yea dry and clumpy* 💀💀💀
Why are they acting like ramen isn’t a soup???? What????
Why are they eat ramen with a spoon.....like noooo
2:23 girl bye
I love these comments
Dude the water aka broth is what makes ramen ramen
To me the best ramen is packet ramen or professional made ramen. No homemade ramen is goin to cut it. All these are pathetic and looks like garbage
No broth??? The broth packs so much flavor! I just put 2 American cheese slices in mine and mix until they’re fully melted.
I feel like the cheetah print girl was bias... she already had it set in her head that hers was the best.. hence why she “didn’t like” any of em💀😂
The pretty girl with the leopard print was doing a lil too much 🤣
That girl talking bout the ramen being watery when her ramen was clumps and fucking dryness it’s not ramen without the broth
she has a block of cheese in her ramen
Can anyone see the cheetah print girl a pick me girl (don’t mind my user name  I made it awhile ago
why are they eating it with a spoon?
But why r they using spoons
it’s funny because the girl that has the nasty ramen is talking the most stuff like good night why was it chunky 👩🏽‍🦯
first of all, why they eaten the ramen with spoons? Like at least a fork 😬 Second of all, ain’t ramen supposed to have like a soupy broth?  And third of all the cheetah print girl’s ramen was as dry as my life! Like you be hyping it up and no one liked it 😂
I make black bean noodles.
Them : its too wateryyyyy Me : They need to go to a ramen shop or READ the instructions on a frickin instant ramen pack -_-
They all lost my mom got the cool skills
They’re all so shady with each other like just be nice, damn 😭 like save the criticism until AFTER you’ve tried it at least. Foolishness
"I prefer dry ramen-"  We can all tell gurl 😂😭✨
they act like you're not supposed to have soup with ramen like wtf
As a Nigerian person living in Nigeria, I think I speak for all of us when I say we don’t claim whatever that is that she made 😬 (abeg mayowa you need to stop)
pour out most of the water and add your seasoning after so it's stronger, then add lime juice and cholula. the best way i've had it. it's also fun cus the lime juice turns the broth neon lol.
I’m 14, here’s my ramen recipe:  Cut up carrots and green onions and put them in the pot and wait until it boils Then when it starts boiling add the ramen Cook a fried egg (or scrambled) When the ramen is done boiling keep it in for another minute, then it’ll become kind of “jelly” like sticky Then pour out some of the water but don’t DROWN the ramen in the water only keep a little bit of water Then heat a skillet and pour a little bit of oil on it and wait until it heats Then put the ramen on the pan and it’ll fry lightly (try not to put the boiled carrots in it, you can but the chopped green onions on it tho) Then you can add the chicken flavour (the packet, you can use the beef or spicy packet too) whatever ramen flavour you chose Then add whatever else spices you prefer example: cayenne pepper, chilli powder, sriracha(etc) I usually add only the chicken flavour packet The voila you got my ramen I made when I was 11 :D
Just noodles😓the soup is the best part lmfao. Gay asf
Where tf the soup at🥶
5:37 yes honey we know
Bro I just get a instant ramen🤤that shit good💯the spicy lemon one
Ramen is literally made with broth-
Why does everyone hate having soup in their ramen 😭
Well I got some more ideas to spice up my ramen but I prefer my Belizean way which is making the soup and in a little bit of the broth melt happy cow cheese and adding pepper, or some people cook the ramen and add and egg or you could cook the ramen and just a soy sauce to your taste or your can fancy  your ramen up and mix it with campbell soup or maggie soup or both and add chicken and potatoes and stuff like that
They all so dry and acting like it’s supposed to be like that 💀   But can we also talk about how they using a spoon 💀
Bruh why does ramen need to have color, you’re eating it
Non of them looks good 💀
I lived on Ramen back in the day...
Umm ya need my ramen . Cause these ones are dry. Is this on how not to make ramen ¿ 😂 Cheyenne the only one that knows how to cook ramen it’s soup so it’s supposed to have the juices in it.
I’m guessing the shrimp one didn’t taste as good as it would normally because it had gotten soggy and colder
Damn I thought the circle with their faces on it where like actual reactions to what they gon say about their ramen but I realised it’s just a picture
Where is the broth? All of their noodles looked dry except for the last girl
All this ramen look gross.
First of all , them noodles dry as hell . Where the juice at
Inmates at a prison could do better than all em
bruh why the hell are they eating noddles with a spoon
ramen is a soup bro its supposed to have water.
Ew this is dry       I only like dry ramen
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon tho-
okay now let’s get some Asian college students to try this challenge and do it correctly
Ramen is supposed to have broth 🤣 Traditional ramen has broth (I always get some noodles with my chopsticks and then spoon up some broth :3)
The Nigerian girl reason the comments 😢
why do they like their ramen like pasta 😭😭
do they not know how ramen look like or what a ramen is????
I’m sorry but what are these ratings lmao , how they be getting them 😂 I know it’s not the avg between the numbers. I’m genuinely curious. But all of these people making me mad at how they cook their ramen lolll.
Bruh why the girl with the print shirt tryin to make her noobles sound good😂😂
“they went wrong when they woke up-” same
my advanced procedure for making ramem is: get ramen boil water  put in cube of ramen thing you get at store  add soy sauce and teriyaki sauce let stir for 3 min put in bowl add flavor pack add more soy sauce and teriyaki sauce eat
Bra these comments made my day 10x better😭😂
the fact that they all thought they were the best sends me 💀-
People that eat ramen without broth are weird.
"it has water in it"  Philippines Lucky me: Wait wha-
My mans did Olu wrong with that saltine cracker reference💀
do they not realize the “water” is the season that ramen it supposed to have 💀💀 it’s called broth, it’s not supposed to be dry lmao
um why are they eating it with a spoon
here’s my ramen recipe ~chicken flavored ramen ~sesame oil ~sometimes a bit of chili oil (optional) ~quarter of a lime or lemon (optional, just adds a slight tang) ~tajin seasoning (or a similar chili/lime seasoning)  1. cook ramen and drain water.  2. add sesame oil and chili and mix. 3. add flavor packet and desired amount of tajin. 4. add some lime or lemon if you wish.  don’t come for me ✋
The black girl with the Afro is annoying .. she too confident like hold on calm down .🙄
Out of all of them, I would only attempt to eat Cheyenne bc she that only one who didn’t drain all her water out. Like who eats it dry like that💀
I'm sorry but Oluwamayowa really got me mad, IT'S STRUGGLE RAMEN! Of course it's not going to be a perfect well seasoned meal.
bruh why are they eating with  a  🥄
Cheyenne: why are the noodles so mushy?  Me: ?????
holy all 3 contestants were mad annoying this time. usually theres that one that is super extra and annoying. well thats all 3 with them.
Not me drenching my ramen with hot sauce and putting some microwave chicken and broccoli on top-😭
“It’s salty are u trying to kill me?” 😭 *Honey I wish..* 💀
Honestly they all prepared their ramen wrong. Cheyenne was the only one that came close with having a broth. We Americans have been eating ramen wrong for years. It is actually a soup where you add meat, a boiled or fried egg and some herbs and veggies and the spice mix it comes with along with the noodles.
If I eat ramen I would actually add some seasoning and that I like on my ramen and also add some spam and a fry egg to top it off.
I don’t trust anyone who eats the ramen just with a spoon ngl
Baby is you don’t got a microwave just say that😭😭😭
This is how we rock 😊
Y'all need some indomie and shin ramen in ur lives. Not that grey and mushy maruchan top ramen stuff sis. Sincerely ur local asian college student.
One girl complained that the ramen had water but her ramen had clumps of fucking RAMEN!
she said two and threee.... she was sad they was boymb
I like Cheyenne’s best. The soup is supposed to go with noodles. The shrimp adds an extra touch!
WHO EATS RAMEN WITB A SPOOOOONNNN
He talked the most shit and got a 2
sooo...i like my ramen with broth...not dry???
Am I the only one confused as to why they saying the Ramen "watery" i call mines gravy and that where the flavor is at, when you season it....or am I cooking it wrong..
RAMEN AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE DRY BRO WTF?!?
Cheetah girl said the chicken was an accessory but called the shrimp cute 🤣🤣 okay girl
What is wrong with these people like the regular ramen is good like if you want it dry pour out the water and you can add like spices but not what they did like 😓🤔😐
I knew sis was gonna flop bc she was too serious and talking too much trash 😩🤣🥴
Lol it doesn’t have to have color. Who eats their ramen with SOUP and decides not to eat it because it’s too light lol
Lmaooo why she said RA-MAN 😂😂
Cheetah girl is getting on my last nerves-
I don't care about ramen :) I'm here cuz I saw those gorgeous women in the video <3 they look like models omg!
"Ramen is a bit watery-" NO FUCKING SHIT LMAO
Is it like regular ramen that you buy at a store like a dollar a pack
1:12 well Ill be da-
Bruh I don’t know what world these people live in where their ramen doesn’t have soup in it. Or should I say “water”.
This video is just as cringe as the fucking potato pie buzzfeed video
Let’s be honest they all petty and all of there ramens look trash
It makes me mad because ramen is a soup and their like “too slimy, too watery” dude noo dry shit!!!!
First of all why spoons like why
i envy the confidence that cheetah girl has
That’s broth LOL and it’s the best part to
Bruh this is painful to watch.
Now why would you use the worst brands of instant ramen. And why is there barely any broth and CRUNCHY RAMEN
first of all why they eating ramen with a spoon and only a SPOON 💀
WHERE IS THE BROTHHHH???????????????
sorry y'all like dry ramen?? what?
HE DID NOT 😂 😭 “Is that a hair.” AHHH IM DEAD
Afro girl is rude she literally makes me maaaad
Why she so worried about the color?
Wait I eat my ramen with a fork😂am I eating it wrong
I just make my ramen with cheese, chicken, peas, garlic, and sometimes a sauce. I don't want a soup but also dint wanna eat sand so i leave a small bit in there. THATS how you make ramen
I prefer my ramen with soft boiled eggs
Olu be like shout out to the shrimp that saved the day I be like shout out to the girl who eats dog shit
the ramen "water"? u mean the broth??
y’all... the water it’s called broth it’s a soup. That’s how ramen is supposed to be eaten.
bye who doesn’t like the broth 🤔
everything looked nasty
Ain’t no soup in these
So we all gonna ignore the fact they eating ramen w no broth w a SPOON
Cheetah print girl just pissed me off the whole video, she was acting so confident when everybody else said hers was the worst 💀
It looks dry there ramen😭
I dont like sea food
Lmfao the fact that the “pickiest one” ALWAYS LOSSES
Why are we using spoons💀😂!?
buzzfeed renamed their channel?
damn their ramen looks bad bruh mine is really good i add garlic, cayenne pepper, chili flakes, soy sauce, hot sauce, and so many other spices
how i do my ramen *add chicken (grilled or fried)* *seasonings* *veggies (carrot and broccoli)* [cue cooking music] *TADA!! ramen, but "dowka style"*
At the beginning of the video they’re acting like they are the definition of poverty and then they complain the entire video about how the food looks.
Wanna know the real struggle is having ramen and the water in the house not being on so you eat the uncooked ramen with the seasoning out of the packet. That’s broke. And that looks like what the first two contestants did with their ramen. Dry dry DRRRYYYY  RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH!
I eat my ramen with Siracha soy sauce and lemon. Delicious if i might add lmao
So they dont eat it with the broth i thought u always did that...
He looks like a Marcus
EW WHO LIKES DRY RAMEN I HATED RAMEN FOR LIKE 2 YEARS WHEN I WAS A KID BECAUSE MY MOM ALWAYS DRAINED THE SOUP OUT OF IT
for the cheetah girl I agree with adding some african spices but like,      why so dry tho 😭
Olu was being kind annoying the whole time and she kept talking bout hers was gonna win but no one liked it-
Why are they eating it with a spoon
bruh cheyenne is the only one who made ramen the others just made stir fried noodles
1:47 DID SHE REALLY SAY HER MOM IS SPANISH
Who decided to let these people eat ramen with a spoon? 💀
Goo Bridgeport ct
WHY ARE THEY SAYING ITS TOO WATERY, RAMEN IS M E A N T TO HAVE “WATER” ITS CALLED BROTH I- 🤦‍♀️
Ramon supposed to be in broth 🧍🏻‍♀️
Wtf they think ramen is????? Ramen is literally a soup, it’s supposed to have water in it.
I’m sorry but who tf eats ramen with a spoon
No lie mine is pretty close to the shrimp one but I add a seaweed seasoning straight from Hawaii and I do a half boilded egg only drizzle soy sauce because I use a bit of seasonings and oyster sauce.
this Nigerian neuroscience women was annoying asf
“It’s salty” “season the ramen” ma’am salt is seasoning 🧍
Olu raving bout her ramen and hating on everyone else’s killed me😂 they Didn’t like her ramen😂💀💀
tf yall are making soba that's not RAMEN like where tf did you see ramen without the broth ✋😫
okay but her RAMEN WHY IS IT SO CHUNKYYYY
Cheetah print girl annoying asfk
There’s so much wrong in this video like first of all ramen has broth not just plain as dry noodles secondly if u were to eat just noodles use a fork and if u were to eat REAL RAMEN the one with broth/soup use chopsticks or a spoon even
Am I the only one that eats ramen with the packet that’s in it
Its funny how i just ate Ramen and then this was Recommended to me😭   How do y'all like your Ramen dry and Miss girl in Cheetah shirt really Ramen is supposed to have water in it💀
PLS SHE WAS HYPING HER RAMEN N SAYING EVERYONES WAS BAD PLS N ENDED BEING THE WORST ONE
Does your ramen don’t come with seasoning??? I’m confused...  I’m from Indonesia so I’m used to indomie, we rarely put extra seasoning on it cause it already taste good
Do people not know to to boil noodles add in a seasoning packet and fry an egg...?
They did that girl wrong in the thumbnail why her face like that!?🤣🤣
Broke teen here! Here’s how I make ramen even though no one asked. ( I just hated how all of them made their ramen):  -instant ramen packet  - paprika and chilli powders  -chicken or pork bullion (or actual broth if I’m lucky) -green onions and or leeks if I have any  -leftover ham (or deli ham), pan fried in soy sauce and sesame seed oil (if I have sesame seed oil haha) -Soft boiled egg -various vegetables cut thin, boiled together in the broth  Idk. I just don’t understand why all of them like it so dry, it’s so much worse that way. My recipe is by no means a perfect one, but hey I try. Also it takes about 10-20 minutes to make depending on how much of the items I have in leftovers.
That cheetah print girl stupid as hell
Racist how theres only black people
I mean i like my ramen in a way everybody likes it in a way
This comment section is killing me😹😹
they don’t got no water????
Funny thing is, the person with the worst ramen, prolly has better things to do.....like maybe studying...
Why why they eat it with a spoon
Ramen is usually soup, but they want it to be dry?  Ok, I confess I make mine dry but I thought I was the weirdo
"there's no enough shrimp" BITCH THIS IS A BROKE RECIPES EDITION.
“Broke college kids” 🤣🤣
marcus.
0:09 Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru vibes
Olu was talking but everybody else Ramen so I'm thinking she going to come through and I see that rat pieces  with a nice side of rocks
How can people eat ramen dry?
“it has water in it” 😀 uhmm who’s gonna tell her that ramen needs broth to be ramen, if it don’t have broth then it’s just noodles 🤨🤨
Why do people even add stuff to ramen? And that one chick saying it was salty dude ramen is ALWAYS salty ....
THE SIDE OF THE STREETS? URS WAS DRY CHUNKY UNFLAVORFUL
My Ramen is Ramen but Mexican
ik ramen is meant to have broth/soup but am i the only one who prefers it dry lmao 😭 now that im not broke i just buy soba since i like it much better but when i was broke buying 60 cent ramen at the corner store i would always drain all the broth out
This one has some water in it...I prefer mine a little dry:)  A LITTLE?
I like how they added “broke” lamo
they all don't know how to make ramen 💀
Right.. ramen is supposed to be a soup. Soba is the broth less noodle dish.
all of these suck 💀💀
ok 1. why are they eating it with a spoon?!?!   2. Don't they know ramen is supposed to have broth? show these ppl what real ramen looks like PLEASE!!!
Im tryna know if all college students be makin they Ramen with no broth, all of those look dry 💀
"This shit look dry as hell" /me: i see/my ramen: I aM ALWAYS DRY AF
bro its literally 20 cent ramen and they're surprised it ain't gourmet??
Who is broke and puts shrimp in their ramen. You can use other things like an egg, green onions, and some pork or chicken instead of seafood.
Cheatea print girl was like it's such a vibe and everyone else was like gross then when she was trying everyone elses she was like nasty
Man you needa put some mfs on this show from the hood ion know what the fuck there ramen noodles there making
I knew the stuck up one was going to have the worst one
im confused isnt ramen like a soup though with the water based broth??
The girl with the hi gh est ego got the lowest points,
Honestly cheats print girl didn't like there's bc her spices are probably super intense
That’s not just water that’s almost like a broth 💀
The girl in the cheetah print reminds me of the “where’s the flavor” “it’s not sweet enough for me” “ where’s the nutmeg” old lady from the other channel. The sweet potato pie vid
Me getting excited when the girl said she's Nigerian. I was like show them how it's done. Then she said said crayfish, who the hell puts crayfish in ramen. Second why is your ramen dry as hell, I'm actually confused.
These people just build different cuz ramen is supposed to have water, the only normal one was the girl with the shrimp ramen
Why are they so mean 💀
“It’s feels slimy” bruh that’s how noodles are supposed to be
Cheetah girl ramen aint it 🤮
im glad that the nicest one there won
Please don't use Gods name in vain instead say oh my gosh or oh my goodness
It’s always the ones who talking the most shit who get the worst rating
I don’t like cheetah girl
Oluwamayowa: it’s salty, are you trying to kill me?  Also Oluwamayowa: the only thing that has flavor is the chicken.. season the ramen..   HUH!?🤨
Why are they all some dry af bowls. These people don't know what ramen is. Yea pack ramen isn't the best but real ramen is all about the broth. That's all a fail to me
The broth litterally MAKES the ramen. Tf are these people on? "To MuCh WaTEr"
this ppl out here eating ramen without broth??? I'm sorry but if I don't get to drink the broth with a side spoon it isn't a ramen.
''The ramen is a bit wattery''  :')
Don’t take them to a ramen place 💀
Why are y’all mad bc they have their opinions and dislikes 😭
Bruh where the soup at? Thats why its salty, aint no water to dilute it. You got chicken but no water?
Loooolll that girl was so confident 😭
Bruh olu's Ramen looking dry and why they acting like Ramen can't have water in it
I litterly just out it in the microwave leave a little water and add hot sauce😐
i want to slap all of them. None of their ramens look g but they be so negative
I hope Olu reads this comment section
Me who jus uses regular Raman and adds hot sauce and sugar 👏🏼✨
It’s always the one who hypes up there stuff for it actually to be 💩😀
Cheetah shirt girl might as well open a new pack of ramen and chug it then and there lmfao wtf
"it has no colour"  bruh its ramen what would you expect
All I need for my ramen is :  The chicken seasoning packet  A bit of vinegar  & Hot sauce
Can someone tell me WHY TF THEY EATTTING IT WITH A SPOON
Olu, queen ... It cant be dry, seasonless and salty. I love you and your blackness radiates
I like my noodles dry lol
WHY ARE THEY EATING THE RAMEN WITH A SPOON???
Do these people know how to make ramen? At least in my opinion, it needs broth-
Cheyenne’s is bussin
One of those girls is a food snob
i thought ramen was supposed to have like water or soup-
I'm sorry no disrespected to any of the people in this video but who the hell in the right mind will eat ramen with a damn spoon🤣🤣🤣 I mean I'm just saying
Why they judge your mom in like a 5 star cores meal
Ramen has a BROTH!!!! Without that ‘watery stuff’ as the dry girl said, it’s just a load of noodles lmfao
This is embarrassing for everyone that isn't Cheyenne.... ya'll complaining ramen got broth??? where do you think the flavour comes from, hunnies.
All that shit she was talking like ewww
the girl with a afro is doing to much like girl you are broke stop acting like u can only eat 10 star meals.
Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup, it supposed to be served WITH a broth and potentially meat and vegetables, not dry...
I just wanna know why they all eat it like its lo-mein. Ramen is supposed to have broth smdh
This is the first time ive heard anyone say “the ramens a bit watery” do yall americans just eat the noodle dry????
Why they all black though like they picked them on purpose and the caption is BROKE college students like that’s sum racist stuff
I bet the Afro har girl fights for her rights,like bish it’s ramen and I bet it tastes like shiii
This was funny, just in a different way then I thought it would lol
Why the spoons tho?
“the ramens a little watery” like.. doesn’t ramen originally have broth jdsjsh
I don’t like the one girl she makes me mad
yall never tried instant ramen if yall didnt try indomi  shout out to all these Indonesians out there i wouldnt survive without yall ramen ❤️
Does anyone just use the seasoning in the packet??? 😂😂
Is it really ramen if it doesn’t have broth? Yes they are ramen noodles, but does that really make it ramen?
You know the dry ramen girl used to eat dry spaghetti noodles for fun😂
How can she be so pretty but her ramen so ugly
why do they all look so bad...
For some people that was broke they sholl picky
Her mom is Spanish 😭😭😭 what part beauty supply and hood 😭😭 girl bye

The cocky ones always lose
Not them complaining abt it being watery, when it's supposed to be watery T_T
Honestly the girl Cheyenne noodles looked the best, she made me wanna taste it.
Omg this is stupid they’re noodles 😭
Who the fuck eats ramen with a spoon
Olu thought she was gone win because she had 15 secret spices and herbs but you aint the kernels chicken , more like popeyes biscuits  🤷🏿‍♂️
ummm wheres the broth
Bro was actually cool af. I wasn't expecting that haha
Olu gave me the same vibes "nina😡nina😠nina🤬" girl did
what’s with their dry ramen 😭 lmaooo mine always gotta have broth man
do they know that ramen is soup and is supposed to be watery😀
I want chicken now
The one girl was comparing all the ramen to her own. That’s not how you judge food...
5:35  The lion the witch and audacity of this b*tch
why’re they eating with spoons
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOKN NARUTO IS PISSED RIGHT NOW!
cheyenne was the only one that was even close to making something u can call "ramen" cuz ramen means noodles in broth and she was the only one with something close to that  made me mad when the dude said like "something u see at the side of the street" 😂😂😂😂
The cheetah girl she was like my ramen is so good ,blah,blah and everyone hated it,
why are they eating ramen with a spoon
I like my ramen like my noodle cup
Umm ok c'mon ramen needs at least a little liquid it's nasty when its too dry and too salty you mean gjt also use seasoning on the chicken
did the producers just tell them to be as ruthless as possible?? 💀💀
FIRST OF ALLLL the last girl was the only ramen i would eat because who is eating dry ramen😭😭 like huh? It’s supposed to have a soup 🍜.
Ramen is supposed to have broth you dummies..taking this shit too serious
okay...you can afford CHICKEN?!..SHRIMP!?...friggin FISH SAUCE? (a bottle of fish sauces is $6!!!)  and you're trying to pass it off as "my struggle" or "broke-a@@" student???  Open a cup of ramen and add hot water THAT'S what REAL broke students do.
1 minute into the video and i'm already hoping cheetah print girl loses
Soooooo basically a lot of black folks don’t know what REAL ramen is supposed to taste like or look like lol. The fact that they didn’t like broth in their ramen told me everything I needed to know lol. Even in basic ramen  bowls....there’s broth smh 😂😂😂
The last Ramen is more traditional because it has broth unlike the other ones
bro some ppl don't like it with water it's ok don't be o pressed about this part but yeah cheeta print girl was insane, her ramen had CHUNCKS
Have they just,,, not seen authentic ramen
Cheetah print girl reminds me of that mom “J” when she was supposed to be trying the other moms’ soulfood
ok but why is no one talking about how they’re eating it with a spoon and not chopsticks or even a fork  (Idk if this is normal, I’m Asian. Forgive me if I sound stupid 😂)
y'all are eating ramen wrong if you hate it having liquid. like wtf? ramen is supposed to have broth. if you want "dry" noodles just eat some damn pasta instead of ruining ramen
My bros don’t like water in their ramen 😭y’all are never allowed to eat GOOD ramen then. IT’S SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER LMAO!
I make my ramen with soy sauce, brown sugar, egg, onion red pepper and I have a lil water leftover.
lol that cheetah print girl really said “I prefer mine a little dry” Like A LITTLE? Hers looked raw 💀
Are they eating ramen with.... spoons?
ARTHUR IS THAT YOU?
Wait are they eating with....spoons-
They really out here eating ramen with a spoon.
why do they keep calling her ramen "watery" bbs it's called broth
I’m sorry but 2 of there noodles look dry to me. I like having water in my noodles then putting the seasoning and hot sauce. In the end, the water in my noodles because red from the spices and hot sauce.   Not trying to hate.
The cheetah girl was ANNOYINGG
But..... Ramen is soup? WHY IS IT DRY???????
bruh ramen is originally supposed to be noodles in SOUP what do they mean by “i don’t like my ramen soupy”
the cheetah girl annoys me so much💀
Nobody: LITTERLY nobody: Not even a single soul: My sister makes sugar cookies Me: "WTF EW ITS SALTY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME!? MOM!!!" 😩✌
these people cannot cook ramen
Eating ramen with spoons 😂😂
This is the recipe of my broke college ramen : cook it until it’s ready take the water out  put all the spices that comes with it add butter  lemon juice and a little bit of  hot sauce 🤌🏼💋
So I'm the only one bothered by the fact that they are eating with spoons?.. Oh okay
They eat noodles with spoons??? Why not forks?
2:06 means asf
Okay but where is the broth😀
Who else is Nigerian and got excited when they heard her Nigerian name then got confused when she made chunky noodles.   Just me? okay
they eat ramen with a spoon.. im.
Naw cause the girl in the cheetah print was so confident ✋🏽😭
Why is the cheetah print girl and the dude so stupid? 💀
All these scores were out of 20, no one made even half 💀 they came to win
I can’t with the cheetah shirt girl she is a BISH
Bro why they eat it with a spoon lmao
i-isnt ramen a soup ...?
I'm confused...where is the broth. It's just powdered undercooked noodles.
What do u mean dry bruh it’s not supposed to be dry my guy
I would’ve lied and made some nasty ass ramen put some jelly in it and peanuts and raw flour in it
Not yall tryna bash Nigerians in the comment based on one girl. Watch yourself😐. Nigerian food Is good af she just shouldn't have mixed ramen poorly.
All of their ramen looks overcooked
Am I cooking ramen worng but don’t you put water in ramen and what about the broth or use the packets
Cheyenne graduated on my birthday 😳😳
Did she just say a landslide?
The negative person always loses 😂
So nobody talking about the title?
this bitch said iT's SaLtY" then said it had no flavor
Its always the one who is most confident who comes last😭 she’s a damn embarrassment
I eat my ramen with a lot of broth. Do people not really do this??
“It’s salty” not even 5 seconds later “It’s ramen season the ramen.”😒
I call my dry ramen, drymin
I thought everyone keeps the broth in ramen?
I don’t know how people can like ramen dry
You can’t have a contest for who makes the best Ramen everyone makes a Ramen different
"It needs more shrimp" Boy we brokeeeeeeee
I always make my ramen with water wtf is going on here ctfu
Tf they mean the ramens a watery that's how its supposed to be its fuckin broth
When they try the girl in the polkadot shirts Ramen the cheetah girl said three and then the other guy said 6.5 what they should’ve done was gave her the score that was in between that not added together because what if it was really good and they both said 10 then they could not put 20 it doesn’t make any sense
The girl with the clown like hair no offense said omg are you trying to jill me this is so salty to marcus ramen and then 2 seconds later said whys this have no taste its so bland like what
Girl 👧🏾 in the cheetah print was talking so much shit 😭🧍‍♀️ and hers is clumpy 💀💀
Ramen is noodles and BROTH so its supposed to have more liquid.
Basta ako masaya na ko sa "PANCIT CANTON"
Are they broke because they're black ?
Do they not have broth in their ramen.... it’s soup
i just want to saz to the ppl judging the fact that it had water. Ramen is noodle soup... so ofc it has water
the only one i liked was the girl with the braids
they don’t know how to make ramen lol they should’ve just said quick pasta bc.... then one made ramen a finger food... how tf u make ramen a finger food. why is it a block😭
i’m nigerian, but the nigerian girl was annoying asf
Why u gotta call them broke like that 😔😔
It’s always the ones who think they got the best in the world who got shit food
The cheetah print girl needa calm down it’s just ramen literally less than a dollar 😭wym add fish n recipes it’s noodles my guy
Who don’t leave water 😭
cheetah girl thought she did something lmaooo
They don't look broke. Makeup and hair on point so... Uhhhhh
Not Olu giving the good ramen a three after she gave them stones for ramen
5:38 "i would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" oh we see-
Ramen so dry dryer than then a public hair dryer ramen so free freer then a public restroom
THAT ISNT WATER ITS LITERALLY BROTH PLS 😭😭😭‼️
If it's not top ramen I don't want it 😭
did they set this girl up? she had to be scripted lmao
These have to be 2000 babies 😂😂 no noodle juice in the noodles
It ain’t ramen if there ain’t no water🤦🏽‍♂️that’s just noodles
soo we gonna ignore how ramen is supposed to have broth..
That is why in a challenge you don't need to hype or think yours is better than other's
where’s the broth😭😭 this is literally just noodles
Congratulations to the girl with black shirt
Maruchan ramen, chicken or beef flavor, keep the broth, add some egg and there you go. Can’t go wrong with classic.
Y'all would've done better to just follow the instructions on the packet and left it at that. Just shameful. 😬 Also, it's not water, it's broth.
how did they go so wrong...
I had so much faith in cheetah girl until everyone said it was nasty, she hyped herself up so much (and everyone just hated how the winner had broth, like that’s normal for ramen lol)
The cheetah print girl really embarrassed her self. Miss girl had clumps up dry noodles
Do y’all store the ramen in the fridge or some shit where tf the juice at💀💀 it should be steam coming out they bowls😭
I would literally only eat cheyennes ramen
this is disgusting. how do you mess up ramen. literally just  boil like two eggs, put it in the pot and boil until almost done, but not quite. pour the broth and noodles into your bowl. put the boiled eggs in with your ramen and by the time you've done that, the broth will have already cooked the rest of the ramen. you're done. unless you're feeling a lil special or whatever, then add a lil seasoning or hot sauce or something 🧍🏾‍♀️
I kind of hate it when people compare their food that they made to others, it just proves they’re being bias instead of giving some good constructive feedback
Wait you guys eat ramen with a spoon!?
i would cook them all at making ramen
Y’all add stuff to your ramen?
i’m feeling second hand embarrassment for the girl in the cheetah print
Why they usin spoons instead of forks
Nah what sort of noodles are they having? Like where are the Super Noodles for £1? 👁️👄👁️ These look like worms
where is the broth 💀 what is this..
Curly haired sis with all the mouth was the worst 🤷🏽‍♀️
"the noodle is pretty watery"  i mean who literally want to eat a noodles with crunch sis-😭
You know it’s bad when they say “it’s edible” 😭😂
Not enough shrimp? She is a broke college student! Helloooo 😂😂😂
the girl wearing cheetah shirt was too cocky thinking her ramen was going to top the others... SIS YOU LITERALLY HAD THE MOST DRYEST RAMEN NOODLES I EVER SEEN YOU MADE ROCKS. “It has water in it...” ramen noodles are supposed to have broth????!!!
Oh the way Oluwamayowa (cheetah print girl) said everything in confidence  👉👈- girl please no- 😭
Asians cringing hard when they hear "ramen should be dry not wet". Like yo we do both, youre missing out if you dont try the other half of the recipes that has a bangin broth.
the ones that talk the most trash always have the worst ones lmaooooo
Idk what the other two where talking about that broth brings the flavor!!
Wheres the ramen soup?  That aint ramen. Wtf is this.
Why was she so pretty but such a bitch
Wtf who eats ramen dry
They violated the girl who made the chunks of ramen
Okay can we do another ramen challenge because I’m telling you I have the best !!  How can I be featured?😂
Jesus died on the cross for our sins what is sin killing stealing committed adultery and doing bad things that does not make Jesus Pleasant it's like saying when you do something good you feel happy but when you do something wrong you feel bad yes Jesus Christ do exist believe it or not he's the beginning and he is the end some people wants to believe in the devil when something bad happens they say that the devil did it. And I don't understand the person that said they don't believe in Jesus be the main ones that want to go to heaven and it does not work like that Heaven is a place there's no sin there's love peace and joy forever who on this Earth would not want to be happy Living With Jesus everybody wants to be happy my brother and sister find Jesus and repent he will show you who he is may the Lord Jesus Christ bless you ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼.
Why are they acting like ramen isn’t supposed to have broth 😩
Let’s normalize leaving in the reactions of the cockiest ppl that did worst
The cheetah print girl noodle was the worst it wasn’t even cooked properly 😂
Imagine using only a spoon to eat ramen.
Is she Nigerian ? I can’t tell
My name is Shyann
Bruh ramen supposed to have broth
Why is the cheetah girl so mean lol
"There's not enough shrimp." Graduating don't mean shit, you still broke.
LMFAOOO
I know nobody is really going to read this , but Can you please check out my YouTube channel 🥺❤️ i always post great content weekly and I promise you won’t be disappointed ❤️ Help a Girll outtt☺️💕❕
Cheyenne deserved the win there, her dish looked the closest and she was so nice while the other dishes were just a no-no, and the other two were cocky.
Why are they using spoons ✋😀
Asian kid looks at each other’s grades
these people talking about other ppls ramen being dry like theirs isnt
Most of the people in this series just rate others low to win 😭
“The ramens watery” riiight...cause ramen isn’t usually a soup or anything...
Why is it so dry
not the cheetah print girl downgrading everyone els
Isn’t ramen salty? What was she talking about-
Broke college student 💔💔
Her ramen has vibe? Wut
It's salty bitch its Ramen u eat it knowing its has more sodium than u need in a week
See how Nigerians stay? 🤣😭 All that for what sis 💀
Why are they eating raman with a spoon 😃
I hate that cheetah print girl she literally made me cringe
Cheetah print girl on the first round: “Omg this is really salty” Her 5 secs later: “The only thing that has flavor is the chicken, you need to season everything” Salt counts as seasoning your dang food 😂😂😂
Not a very diverse line up I see...
So y’all eat yo ramen with no juice ? What in da fuack man
Why do these people not know what broth is???? I'm so confused
Shrimp in broke ramen? excuse yourself right now 😳 Me, a peasent, can't even get that tinned tuna in
It’s the broth, it’s not really water. Does no one leave the broth(water) in it? The noodles will get dry.
I had a roomate that would microwave his ramen FOR 7 MINUTES!!!
I don't know if it's because I'm asian but I eat my instant ramen with broth sry bro/half cooked ramen girl.
Bruh they are all black lol
I love how they all don’t know how to cook basic ramen yet they are the pickiest people omg
brus i only add the seasoning
Why are most of their ramens drier than a month old roadkill? Like how the hell are they complaining about the ramen with broth when it’s supposed to have broth?
BRO YALL JOKING RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH TF IS WRONG WITH THEM IM ACTUALLY— IVE LOST ALL FAITH IN HUMANITY
“I would like my ramen dry” it’s not even cooked🤣🤣🤣
bro y’all eat ramen without broth?! 😰
I just put lemon and valentina (mexican hot sauce) I also keep the liquid bc it tastes good to drink after your done with the ramen
I hope the two who didn't like BROTH in their ramen feel kinda dumb after reading the comments.
Sis really said CRAY FISH XD hunny whyyyyy are u adding cray fish to ramen lmaooooo
Lmao why y’all scared of water
bro why tf are they using spoons???
Olu think she a real chef judge 💀💀💀 I'm doneee
I can’t stop laughing at the fact that cheetah girl has audacity to give TIPS 💀💀
Lol they're all so picky and for what, like your broke to begin with. Also why is the ramen just look like noodles. 🍜
All you need is the sauce pack and some hot sauce
Let me get this straight... Cheetah print girl: “it’s so dry!” “No flavor” literally has a ramen noodle with nothing but clumps. Glasses guy: looks good but has no broth. Big earrings girl: has broth the right way.  Either way no one had ramen. Ramen is supposed to be made from pork or miso. I don’t blame them the title said “broke college students”
For these people to be so broke they got a lot of ingredients in there....
I don't think they know what ramen even is-
moral of the video: Girl in the Cheetah Print, humble yourself please
Yo,i can't cook at all... Ramen ain't supposed to be dry-  Even i know that-
Ramen is suppose to have liquid...... I’m soo confused by their comments about the shrimp ramen, she made a legit ramen lol
bruhhh the ramen looks goood whats wrong with themmmm
Pickiest person always got the worst food 😭
But like why are they using spoons to eat the ramen
“I’m not trying to be mean or anything”  Proceeds to bash the ramen
Ramen is made to have some liquid lmao. The best way to make it is boil it but not until it’s super flimsy and translucent. Put all the ramen in a bowl and then add a bit of the water from the pot. Then season or add whatever
Watery ramen?? 😭
Yo they mad stupid 💀 your post to put water in yo noodles. Its not post to be dry.
The title did them wrong
LMAO THERES POST TO BE WATER IN RAMEN ITS NOT POST TO BE STALE AND DRY. THE CHEETAH GIRL FR MADE HERS CRUNCHH
"It has water in it which I guess is Okay" .... um duuuh ramen originally has broth.....
They have ruined ramen loll Chayenne's ramen was okayish since she made it the *right* way  Them be treatin ramen wrong and am sad:(
Isnt ramen just noodles?
as a nigerian (that actually knows how to cook) i don’t claim her. or the attitude. that’s not who we are.
Cheetah girl had the deadest ting everrrr
None of them succeeded on this one
Dry ramen?? Yeah no wtf
🤣🤣 why they make they noodle goowie like that !
Who the fuck uses spoons to eat ra,en why they give them spoons tf
Ramen is supposed to be “wet”
As a asian, i am offended by all their ramen.
DRY ??
You’re supposed to keep the juiceeee 😩😩
WTF LOOK ITS NOT RAMEN WITHOUT SOUP?? it’s just dry instant noodles not ramen. instant noodles isn’t ramen ffs
Jezus the cheetah girl is so obnoxious 🙄
are those two ppl ok? ramen is a noodle soup. SOUP. and complaining about being “watery”.
Add color to it??? Child its a freakin 65 cent pack of noodles
Boy i thought ramen was a soup
These ppl couldnt even test my ramen
She said this is too dry then went on to say i like my ramen more dry
Oluwamayowa: Mine is definitely gonna win! Marcus: eww this is supposed to be fancy ramen?
“I prefer my ramen a little more dry” yeh.... a little TOO dry
imma leave this here and see how many likes i get
Lowkey marcus tho be looking like the  knock off Trippe redd
Bruh olu talking like she know something
“The ramen is kinda watery” well, it’s a ramen, a soup, it’s supposed to have a broth.
All of these are very sad excuses for ramen.. smh I would never spread with these ppl
Why they give them a spoon
Y’all hear me out, put spicy pork rinds on your ramen. It makes it 10x times better
It triggers me so much when people call it „ramen“ when it’s literally just noodles.. whyyyy :((( It should have a broth, it’s a soup! ;;
So it’s people out here eating Ramen with no broth? That’s like ordering a Baconeggncheese wit no Bev 🤦🏽‍♂️
Who are these boneheads who do not want soup to be soupy?!?!  Do better people.
All black not interested. No diversity
I feel bad for Ole
They should've called it something else then ramen when only one of them had broth in it  👁👄👁
Ramen is a japanese noodle soup right?! The broth and noodles are the main ingredients.   We do have a lot of instant stir fry noodles tho ata like Indomie's Mi Goreng, Lucky Me's Pancit Canton even the popular Samyang spicy noodles.    Baka stir fry noodles gusto nila... HAHAHA
the fact that they called ramen watery wtfff brooo💀💀
bro.     Even a 7yr old can make better ramen than the cheetah print gal
Why they gotta be SHADY and “picky” AF🤦‍♀️
These guys know that ramen is often a soup, right? It’s not ‘water’, it’s broth!! I’d take it ‘watery’ over clumpy any day!! Where’s the egg?
I'm so confused. Aren't ramen supposed to be watery.. and wet?
olu is just too proud
My ramen is  Cooked Chicken ramen with some broth A slice of american cheese Scrambled egg seasoned with garlic powder and pepper. Dont knock it till you try it 🤤
when they said the ramen had too much water but it’s supposed to have broth👁👄👁
Picky girl: It’s too salty  Also the picky girl: Season the ramen  Bish is it too salty or flavorless???
I really like that girl with the ponytail in black top when she said her mom told her Don't say anything if you don't have anything good to say. You just know it when you see a good parenting. I follow this myself cause it just makes life a lot easier
Bruh it’s 2 minute ramen, how hard is it?
Is the ramen even warm when they try it?
Ummm the cheetah girl was negative as hell, and her food was some flakey ramen
Do they not know ramen is soup?
I cant stand not having enough water in my ramen. It's just dry salty noodles.
the girl in the cheetah print was BEEFING and hers was the worst lmaoooo
They all can’t make instant ramen wtf
Y’all wanna know what surprising that they’re all dry and already look nasty . My opinion 👀
none of these looked good
What the heck , Dry ramen!? Noooooo
*I would have loooved to see the cheetah print girl's reaction at the end* 😂😂
Am I the only one who finds it weird they’re using a spoon?
Every time they say ramen i wanna scream CUZ THATS NOT RAMEN THATS NOODLES RAMEN IS NOODLES AND SOUP AND OTHER STUFF
no because yall were ACTUALLY getting on my nerves like xDDDD have you NEVER tried ramen with broth??? THE SOUP??? it's literally the best part
theyre eating with spoons is that not odd?! AND WHERES THE LIQUID
bro the curlyhead had me weak😭
I live for this title tho-
Why is everyone complaining about "water" in Ramen ? The authentic ramen is litterly in the Broth
The fact that they dont rlly know what a ramen is , is making me cringe xDD Like hello? Ramen is not just noodles dudeeeee
Where’s the broth?
ok but nothing can ever beat maggi
Oh no I hate ramen I’m not in collage yet😔
Some one should have came in with pot nuddles and they would win
THEY FINALLY DID THIS CHALLENGE WITH INSTANT RAMEN!!
THe cheetah girl is like Jordan from the pound cake one... always so ahead of herself
Do these people even know how to make Ramen?? Ramen without the soup is like pizza without any cheese
Sooo am I the only one who puts water on my ramen , like does ramen look dry dry , like you would think that if your poor you would put more water to drink the flavor ? No just me ? Ok
Isn't ramen SUPPOSE to be watery and wet 👀. I mean as an Asian i think so.
cheetah girl and the guy pissed me off
she calls the ramen salty then tells the guy to season the ramen
Can we all agree that all 3 of there ramens look wack asf dry and mushy and cold
that one with the leopard top is full of herself..
I’m so glad that my friend makes REAL Ramen and not what ever those are ...
“The ramen have a lot of water :/“ guys wtf. Original ramen are in soup ....
Isn't ramen suppose to be watery ??? 😌
they all look worse than if you just do as it says on the package
I feel like they all made these well before it was consumed. Poor job by the producer.
IS THAT SPOON I SEE 😶
People forget that ramen is Asian and it is supposed to be on the wetter side
BRUH all these people don't know how to cook ramen or something... Tsk tsk one too crunchy, other too mushy, last one slimy???
Lemme tell everyone im broke and undercook my noodles cus im hungry😂
Wait..they don’t like the water?.... ramen is literally soup
“...a little bit more dry”    i don’t think you even boiled yours-
Olu just embarrassed her self
My biggest concern is the fact that the BuzzFeed staff gave them SPOONS to eat ramen with? What the fuck
Cheyenne is a vibe
how are they eating ramen with a spoon 😳
The girl with cheetah print gives me the *pick me girl* vibes ! like miss girl chill
The girl who was trashing saying hers was the best one and that she is ganna win had the worst rated one 💀
Have those two never heard of broth?? 💀💀
I feel like at this point they’re kind of trying to only say the negative things about the Ramon more than the positive 😂
Bru the second girl 😐
Rah-men not Rrar-mhen for the cheetah print shirt
"it looks kinda dead"  girl your ramen's raw
PLSSS
wHO UsEs A SPoOn tO EaT RAMEN!?!?!?!
ray-men💀
Ramen is meant to have soup in it.....
idk about anyone else, but personally I really wanted to see how the losers reacted...
It’s ramen not a 5 star meal
2:03 that girl acts like she didn't want to be there and someone forced her or she get killed🤣😂🤦‍♂️..
Bro ramen is suppose to be water it is broth base, and the said it’s too watery what??
But why don't add an egg or just some vegetables? This is not expensive and makes it so much better. I've never seen ramen look that plain before, but maybe that's how americans do it..
all of those just feel.. wrong lol
Wait this is buzzfeed?
May God bless you all. I hope you all can be saved by Jesus Christ 💕 All you need to do is repent of your sins and truly believe Jesus is the Son of God who died for our sins and God rose Him on the 3rd day!! 💖✝️😊
My ramen is normally what comes in the package and thats it. If I want something fancier I would get an egg and that's it?
Was that ramen?
Bruh why yall got spoons
Im floored that these people think ramen with broth is bad wtf
Are Nigerians born arrogant or something??lol Wizkid is cool though
‘i’d prefer it to be more dry’ do you not realize ramen is literally a soup ✋😭 like if u look it up on google it literally says ‘Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup‘
its called "ramen" and not "stir-fry noodles" so why would you make it dry bruuhhh....  edit:im an asian from the philippines so im preety pro about this noodle thing
Evb hated on each other’s ramen 😂
SO DRY RAMEN IS A THING!??! IF MY RAMEN DOSENT HAVE BROTH IN IT I WONT EAT IT😭
i ain't a college student and i can assure u i can make better ramen then all of these people.
Ram-en 🤤
Crack an egg into it a few minutes before it’s done and add your favorite hot sauce. Ez
Marcus and Olu are going to be mind blown when they go to a fancy/authentic Ramen place for the first time!
cheetah girl make me so mad, idk y.
When will people in cooking competitions learn that the raging ego kills them...toot your own horn, look like a fool when karma takes a bite outta your L
Ramen a Little watery?????? Sis im- that's how asian eat ramen and its more even watery in our ramen!!!!! Sis bye
What's wrong with them and eating ramen without the broth💀
Cheetah print annoyin & arrogant af built like a broccoli bush
no broth is a nono
somtimes just keep it simply
do a “teens try each other’s grilled cheese sandwich”
None of these are ramen
Just how tf do you ruin a ramen....? Literally an instant noodle...? Just how?   just a head up, good ramen brands like Indomie and Mamee Chef exist.
But why were they given A SPOON?
the girl with the hair out was gmt 💀 nasty ahh ramen
But why are they eating it with a spoon??
The warm breath successively scare because pantyhose optionally license athwart a synonymous seaplane. uncovered, spiteful fang
Only reason the girl got a 2 is because the guy was nice enough to give 2 points for it being edible.
The “we need to talk” LMAO
3:33 they got me cryingggg
the cheetah print girl was so arrogant and for what 😭 girl go back to your college and learn how to make proper ramen, before judging other people's ones
Olu had a lot of misplaced confidence. I don’t think she’s arrogant
I like how they said they one that ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE RAMEN  looked bad when their ramen was dry bro its supposed to be soupy
Cheetah print girl: “The ramen was really watery”  Yeah and your ramen was really uncooked
The girl with the afro is so annoying wtf
They obviously don't know how to make ramen if the ramen is "watery" to them
They violated them in the title.
Just eat it raw smh
The nigerian girl was just giving a little points so she can win that's why her shit was ass
Cheetah girl thought her ramen was really finna win i already knew it was gon be nasty
Why do so many people want ramen without the broth? I mean, I eat the noodles raw for a snack but if I’m gonna cook it I have to have the noodles in broth
The chetta print girl pissed me off in the beginning and thenn yall eating ramen with a spoon 😭✋🏾
cheetah print came in with so much confidence and just brought in DRY RAMEN 💀 she got on my last nerve oh my god
3:13  “dis shii look dry asl” i died LMAO 👴🏾
These people havent seen soup ramen
is it me or none of them didn’t really look appealing LMAO
... something tells me these people have never had ACTUAL ramen. like why are you complaining that it has broth? thats how you make it???the Japanese in me is crying lmao.
Cheetah print girl was nah
rAmen lol

"i perfer my ramen a bit dry" girl serves ramen bricks 💀
judgement at its finest   mb for using prejudice to whoever noticed, judgement sounds like a better fit :)
this was wild to watch. i’ve never seen two people who don’t know how ramen works more in my life. the last girl with the broth >>>
I was a college student and I didnt eat ramen but hot pot, sushi, and fresh grilled fish. XD I always cooked and got groceries
Yeah idk bout them but ramen taste better with more broth
Is ramen sopposed to be stir fry or soba?
y'all so pressed by the girl in the cheetah print but that's just how nigerians are we're curt and we don't chop words and we're very proud of our food and culture she was expressing her opinion the best way she knows how y'all taking it too deep
Where's the nutmeg?
Ramen is its own category of soups. ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROTH!
Bruh wtf?? As a fellow broke college student, I felt an immense disappointment by the way you all did injustice to the ramen. What a dishonor to the almighty ramen you did. The greatest offense ever happened to us fellow broke college student :(
they don't like the water- ramen is meant to have broth traditionally
Bro who eats ramen without the soup🥴
Uh how are the noodles supposed to get color.....?
My Asian parents are screaming💀 is you guys visit any Asian country, the store is mostly filled with Kari favour or spicy ramen
Why is it always the girl that talks the most shit, always get the lowest rating
Boil it in water, then drain it a little.. not with a lot of water... and not with just nun🤦🏾‍♀️😂, then add Tony’s seasoning, and the chicken flavor that comes with it. And BUTTER 🧈
This is such a disrespect for actual RAMEN. Just call it NOODLES. smh
All of them are black 🤨
“Season the ramen” the bitch just said it was too salty 😂
5:44 you're the one eating ramen wrong if you strain it like spaghetti..
Anyone else put hot sauce in their ramen?
That’s tuff😂
I die inside when people eat ramen with spoons, but I guess that broke life doesn't allow for luxuries such as decent utensils.
Okay cheetah girl calm down. 😭
I'm an Asian but what kind of ramen is this? is it even a ramen?
Bruh are they serious??? They confusing ramen with pasta. THEY SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER LMFAO. How uncultured can you be and saying it with ya chest too?? Also ol girl with cheetah print’s “ramen” noodles look like prison ramen lmfao
Meanwhile Bangladeshis,Indians and Pakistanis: MAGGGYYY
Bro I could win this competition by literally following the directions on the back of a ramen packet, like all those ramens didn’t even have broth like tf. And who eats ramen with a spoon? Also who tf likes their ramen DRY like that ain’t even ramen at that point.
you just know the girl with the cheetah print was never broke and has never made ramen lmaooooo
She thought her food was a 10 but it was a 2😭
it dont hurt to leave alil bit of water in the noodles-
I don’t understand why they were thrown off by the broth with the ramen like ramen usually has broth in it, I didn’t think people poured it out completely tbh
Y’all don’t eat ramen with the soup????
Ramen is suppose to have broth
If you've never had ketchup & tapatio in your ramen you're hella missing out😋

Ramen has to have a little broth. Thats what gives it flavor
I gotta be honest, everyone's ramen looked disgusting
The dude was funny ash
The girl with the curly hair gives me pick me vibes🧎🏽‍♀️
Am I the only one who likes a little broth in their ramen?
I get that the one girl was putting a lot of African spices and twists on the Ramen, but girly, it’s difficult when Ramen is such a unique type of noodle, props to here for trying but that stuff wasn’t even cooked properly
Why are y’all talkin about just the one girl, they were all petty as fuck pretty much throughout the whole video 🤣
Ramen is supposed to have broth in it 💀🤚🏻
But we all need to talk about their ramen, the 3 of them look nasty asf and dry asf with the basic morals. 😹 I know they aren't to broke to have their hair done , have that jewelry and the clothes they have. 😹

Bruh i’ve been poor my whole life. All I need is some wild onions, egg, hot sauce and A little lime and it will win.
“I would perfer my ramen a lil more dry” *we fucking know*
where is the soup doe??
Loool. I just graduated from college and I used dollar store seasonings for my ramen. I know broke come in many different ways but the fact that these students were able to add protein to their ramen got me a lil side eye.
At least the title is being real
Am i the only one that calls maruchan top ramen?😐😐
I would put vinegar in my ramen, along with an egg, onions, and spinach
Cheetah print- rEhmEn
DRY ramen?! The girl in the cheetah shirt was acting a bit snobby if you ask me. She was like oh mine is going to be the best but it was far from it...

Cheetah print girl voice piss me off, period

Dang so dramatic

Why they gotta be black

Who ekse thought the girl in black was the judgy one
The fact that they're eating it with a spoon pisses me off.
I WANT THEM TO TRY MINEEEE
Isn’t the whole part of ramen..... the broth 🤨
Cheetah print has bad attitude
I just gotta say, I have made Top Ramen taste bomb asf. But not the artificial goodness kind. Like genuinely nice instant noodles.  -asain child
We not gonna talk about how they eating it with a spoon
These all look not so good tbh haha. But the last girls was definitely the best like I don’t even have to taste it to know lol
Am I the only one who eats my ramen with a fork?
wtf is this ramen
Why're they eating with spoons ?
Ahaha why the one who has something bad to say is always actually Not ready at all 😅😩
💀 Cheeta print girl gets my on my nerves so much and she be talking about the other people but she still lost 💀
WHO THE HELL DOESN’T WANT THE WATER IN THEIR RAMEN WTF YALL HELLA WEIRD BRUH
WAIT A DAMN MINUTE- DID THE GIRL WITH BRAIDS SAY HER MOM IS SPANISH?! NOOO
That ramen looks dry. It's missing the broth
Doesn't ramen noodles come with their own seasoning?? And why is there shock for soupy ramen??! HAHAHA
THe girl in the cheetah print on the fist thing of ramen, she said the ramen was too salty but 5 seconds later she says it has no seasoning xD
I wanted to drop kick the cheetah girl
This made me lose my appetite
RAMEN COMES WITH BROTH OMG
Miss *NiGeRiAn* got a lil attitude she acts too entitled🙄Don't get me started on them noodles they look raw drier than a popeyes biscuit🤣🤣 and why yall eating with spoons  no hate yall no hate
okay but, why are the noodles dry-
Their noodles be dry like Popeyes biscuits
"Its so salty are you trying to kill me?" 5 seconds later "Season the ramen come on its ramennn"
Umm. Guys? Ramen is NOT supposed to be dry. The “water” is called the broth. Without the broth it wouldn’t be ramen. Just noodles🤷🏻‍♀️
Cheyenne sounds like Porsha from Real Housewives of Atlanta
Ramen is supposed to have broth.. what kinda uncultured swines..
Girl in the Leopard print was such a bitch for no reason 😭😭😭
even for being broke, it looks like they ain’t even try 😩
WHY ARE THEY EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOOn!!!!
Bitch none can beat my broke ass ramen:  1. Boil noodles.  2. Let noodles cool in the water after boiling (this will make them soak up lots of water and get THICC).  3. Add half or less of the flavoring dust from the packet while ramen is still hot and cooling.  4. Eat ramen. Sprinkle more flavoring on top of your bite if you want to shorten your lifespan like me.
Love that the one with the most judgement loses
Broke?
HOW IS THIS RAMEN? THESE COLLEGE KIDS (being one myself) MAKING BAD RAMEN LIKE
The cheetah print girl a little arrogant for a broke college student
A noodles without water is some bs
ramen is supposed to have broth,,,? and why th they eating it w a spoon eye-
Thoughts:  Cheetah Girl: looked dry and seems over seasoned.  Glasses Guy: looked like baked chicken and rice.  Girl with braids: looked decent. I ain’t never have shrimp in ramen but I’m a have to try.   Overall though, where was the broth? Isn’t ramen supposed to have the broth to keep the noodles warm?
I make better ramen then all 3 and I’m only 12
Ok but 3 of y’all can’t cook simple ramen 🤦🏽‍♂️😂😂😂
This has to be acted
Bru she said it’s salty but it needs seasoning
They TRIIIPPING!! That third Ramen looked like it was hitting! Lol I would’ve tore that shit up
The water in the ramen keeps the flavour!
“It look watery I perfer my ramen a litter dry” OBVIOUSLY ur wasn’t even done look dryer than dry cement
It be the person who is so judgmental and cocky that loses 😂😂😂😂 this is so embarrassing for her
I’m not sure how it happened, but blacks people seem to not know that ramen is a soup, not a pasta dish.   It hurts my soul when they complain about it being “wet” or “watery”
WHERES THE BROTH☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
I actually could not tell if this was a joke or not lol
None of these ramen look like ramen to me lol
A 2 because it’s ..edible 😂😂
Remeber kids don’t embarrasse yourself like cheeta print girl
Bro it’s the broth that makes it good- I didn’t even know people ate it almost dry lmao
i need to see one where asian students make this LOL
cheyennes ramen look goooood
A 3 bc she didn’t want to admit it’s great 😂
not them acting like dry ramen is good...
Don’t judge a book by its cover they was talkin about her watery her noodles was but then tasted it and was good dude know it was good but made up stuff and it’s funny how chick was so picky and was the main loser that’s what she get for being so cocky
Bro.. water tho? Broth?????  Anyone???
theres no such thing as a dry ramen lmao
Try mines i pit half a bottle of hot sauce in it
So is the third girl the only one that knows you’re supposed to have a broth with their ramen?
I don’t like the curly hair girl she was acting like she was finna die if she ate it
Who else liked watching olu’s ramen getting shit on
Her shit was dry n clumpy  Ramen should have broth ! I dnc what anyone says 😂 veggies are cheap to add em in. Also the packet seasoning has alot of salt usually so adding and type of salt seasoning to its gonna make it hella salty.
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon? 🤦🏽‍♀️
cheetah print gurl be like: yesss give me some clumpy ramen🔥
“Shut down the studio” 💀
All these look toxic asf  Like how your ramen clump up
Bruh ramen is supposed to be wet like bruuuuhhhhh
that is NOT naija ramen😂😭 where is the egg, yam and tomato?
5:39 of course you would 😭
"I prefer my ramen a little more dry"  her ramen: *CRUNCH*
Gurl does it matter for it to have color no
broke people being picky eaters and pretending to be real chefs cooking instant ramen
bruh this dude saying that the ramen has "water" Thats how ramen is, SOUP.
"it's salty". Bruh do you know how much sodium is in ramen?
They don’t like their ramen with the soup base? Bruh—💀
The nigerian was taking so much mess saying hers was the best but it got a 2
That ain't ramen sis. That instant noodle
"add more shrimp" -forgot it was broke college ramen lol
Water? That’s broth 💀
Can we just talk about this , we have chicken man and Dry girl over here talking about  "whats all this water?  why is it so slimy " like please take a seat i feel like the only person who has even tasted ramen on this show is the last girl
Who could afford chicken let alone shrimp in college?!
“At least she tried”   *gets a two out of ten*
Girl main one talking crap but got the worst score😂😂
Bruh the cheetah girl actin like she all that but her stuff look wierd and talking all that she just said it’s salty then 30 sec later said It NeeDs SeASOnINg and saying everything is bad she things hers is all that and all clumpy no water
The girl with braids is the only one closest to actual ramen. Other two uncultured af 😭
“The ramen is too salty” “The ramen needs more seasoning” Child pick one and move tf on.
The first girl's name is like, *superior*
miss cheetah print girl really thought she was Gordon Ramsey or some shit
5:30 miss arrogant cheetah print girl, you shouldn’t be worried about that. Your eating literal seafood & sawdust, I wouldn’t eat That if that was the only food on earth. Claiming it’s how Nigerians eat that is just disrespectful.
I can tell yall aint from the hood
Why does Marcus look like that ginger kid from jimmy Neutron
bruh why tf does it crunch? ramen ain’t supposed to do that
Yall dont know how to make ramen at all
1: ramen is supposed to have broth or what u call water 2: u don’t eat ramen with spoon only, add a fork
"its so salty" bih is ramen thats wtf its gonna taste like lmfao
College students: I’m broke so i eat ramen but in weekends, i find a way to pay for alcohol 😂
why are they eating ramen with a s p o o n 🤔
Today I realised that the average college student in america can not cook ramen
"The ramens a little watery."  If you look up ramen its in a soup broth, and which is why they give you soup base. The first two contestants must be looking for pan fried noodles or something.
Olu pissed me off
Don’t eat instant noodles ever again. Stick to y’all cook outs
Why she called it remen
These the rich broke college students, the real broke broke college students knew how to make ramen at 10
I'm sorry but, the cheetah print girl was so arrogant, like why are you caring about how it looks when your broke 😭 it's all about the taste
why are they so surprised that ramen has broth
Omfg do these people not know what the fuck ramen is u put broth In ramen it's not water u doofus ass
00:59 Crayfish is a Nigerian spice?
So much animosity and poor sportsmanship in these videos, especially in this one. I hope the witch with the fake 70’s Afro sees this. You can’t even make ramen taste good, and you hyped up your own dish so much, and everyone hated it. Take a seat.
The one talking the most sh*t ALWAYS loses 🤣🤣
Ok but who likes dry noodles um ... that’s concerning
Ok y’all this is the best ramen... I love broth btw: A lot of water to boil Ramen flavoring packet Chicken bouillon  Soy sauce  Sriracha Garlic powder  Onion powder  Cilantro(only a dash) And enjoy I eat this all the time so I know it is amazing. Anyone I’ve told this recipe to loves it. (Do not dump out the broth, anyone who gets rid of the broth is evil and gross. The noodles are best harder in this recipe, don’t over cook them)
They know that ramen has broth 💀
Amazing video
MUTE OMAROSA MIC
lmao why they acting like ramen ain’t supposed to be wet?? 😃
RAMEN HAS BROTH!!! AND AFRO PUFFS NEEDS TO SEKKLE DOWN SHE TALKING TOO MUCH
LMFAOOOO "I need to smell it before I eat it" when she gives them RAMEN
I myself like adding chicken to mine I like mine without water but not dry like the Sahara desert TwT
Funny when people are actual trash and think they’re the best
The fact that she says atagogo instead of atarodo should tell you she doesnt really know a lot about what she used to cook.  And she didnt even know who the other people were or their ethnicities but already concluded that she knew more than them. Beside who puts crayfish in ramen?! 😭i was sitting here like 😦. Would have been better if she just used salt and pepper alone or eaten it raw and snorted the spices since she wants to act like a  mad person💔
Off the jump afro puff probably has the worst noodles
CHEETAH GIRL TALKING ABOUT HOW IT NEEDED MORE COLOR LIKE DAMN URS NEED MORE BROTH STFU
Dude funny as hell. I like my Ramen wet.
They didn't cook the indomie well (Nigerian noodles), it's not meant to be clumped at all.
Yall know ramen is a form of soup how tf can soup be too "watery"😂😂
Ramen is supposed to have BROTH.
I LOVE MY RAMEN JUICY! idk what they talking about 😲
this girl thinks she is so fucking special because she knows some different spices, like pls settle down
The Nigeria girl deserves her rating . She too picky .
Don’t call them broke especially when they’re all black that drags our image. You don’t see the White college kids being called broke in the title even though we know they are. Come on guys don’t do them dirty in the title.
Did em dirty w the title😭
I wish they showed reactions
The girls w the braids that looked good AF ion what they talkin abt I like my noodles w water 💀
It said "Broke College Kids" not legends.
Ramen is suppose to watery or else your just eating plain pasta
I just knew for a fact cheetah prints’ was gonna be gross as hell
The fact that they thought their ramens were the best 😩 not to flex or anything but yall havent tried mine😶
Why do they get the weirdest people for these man
I hated the girl with the afro so much
They should’ve gave the leapord print girl her own ramen and said it was somebodies else’s so she could roast the shit out of it
Ramen sucks now. I used to eat it alot back then.
wait do people not like saltine crackers?
I HATE the cheat print girl hers sucked af
Ever just wanna 🤜👩🏽‍🦱
WHY R THEY EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON 👎🏾👎🏾!!?? like throw them all away frfr🙄
I actually like my noodles dry sometimes now I put a bit of water to make it wet atleast
im Nigerian too omg
It always be the ones with the worst dish talking the most shit 😂
They're all so damn picky
What broke college student has crayfish?
Olu was so full of her self hers was the worst literally had clumps of noodles in her bowl lol😭😭
bruh eggs are cheap, and so is pork shoulder and chives. ziplock bags, season and cook the shoulder, then cut it into thin slices and then freeze it.
Broke College student but want shrimp through out ????
I just had ramen last night, these people are so un creative with their food. Like sis I know you broke i am too but could have at least added the broth? Or maybe some greens for some color? How about a fried or boiled egg? Corn??? Like yeah eggs are not dirt cheap but I’m sure you got some in that fridge of yours. *edit* I give props for the adding chicken and shrimp I think the shrimp one would be my top favorite because at least she had some sense with adding broth. But like Ramen can have a wide range of flavors and add ons that can come cheap too! Fish cakes 🍥 Are like 9 dollars or more and they can get shipped to your house it also adds a pop of beautiful color and an interesting design
Girl with curly hair really sat there and talked her shit about “ramen having to much broth” girl bye! So petty smh
Why are they using a spoon to eat ramen 🤯
Guy at 1:04 : "Nothing can beat this ramen" Me: *Laughs in Blasian*
It’s like a bowl of breadcrumbs 💀💀💀
Haven't had ramen in awhile dug some out of the closet because this video made me crave it
Lol the girl in the cheetah print she was talkin all that smack but she lost
Omg, where is the broth?
The 3rd girl ramen is how I know how to do it
okay here's mine which isn't super out there.  Ramen packet (whichever brand you prefer) cook it - drain most of the water out add season (1/2 to start you can always add the rest) siracha (as much as you like) vinegar and sugar but I use a ketchup packet to substitute (it works man) soy sauce onion powder ( real sauteed if you can)  cayenne  paprika   bam struggle dorm food for CHEAP  edit: this does make it more of noodles in sauce rather than soup but sometimes that's the vibe, do it whichever way you like
Oh gosh “thee ramen is a bit watery” MAAM ITS SOUP
The leopard girl really workin on my nerves 💀
The ONLY one who put water at least MADE ramen!!!
Finally something I can relate to...except the college part. :/
“ill add tatengo and sauce” stfu 🤣🤣🤣
why are they eating ramen w a spoon only
Does anyone know that ramen is supposed to have broth???
its the fact that they put broke college kids instead of college kids
NGL half of the comment section can make better Ramen than them 💀
I like how the cheetah girl was so confident but had the worst rating...
ReMeNnN uh 🙄
These people ain’t broke. All they ramen busted.
Okay but seriously, I didn't know people ate dry ramen-

The girl in black shirt seems so chill and nice. And pretty!
*Cheyenne literally the only person with soup in their ramen*

Bruh did she say cray fish
“I prefer my ramen dry” bitch what do you expect 😭 do you expect them to remake it for you so you can rate it well? Bruh fr 💀
Wdf was the girl who lost pretty af

Do people not know ramen is soup susposed to have broth
Do this with Mexicans
I’m sorry but, Who eats there ramen dry like that? (Unless it’s supposed to be dry like the Spicy Korean ramen that the mukbangers love)
How is first dudes dry WHEN CURLY HAIRED GIRLS IS CLUMPY
I got excited that they were featuring a neuroscience student because I rarely ever come across my people... but then her personality quickly irked me.
bruh. just cool the ramen like how it says on the packaging, but. do what u gotta do
Their not broke
Where is the broth? I thought ramen is meant to have broth? It saddens me that they call this ramen.
People don't eat ramen with the broth???? Yall wildin
“this shit look dry as hell” i’m screaming 😂😂😂
Holy hell, the bar was low. I get that some folk like dry ramen but why are they acting like wet ramen isn't normal??? I mean... Most folk use more water than the third girl used
All these ramen dishes dry af. This how I cook mine.  These assume you know the basics. You got to season the water that the noodles are being cooked in and I use seasoning salt black pepper and a little bit of garlic powder. I'd say around a teaspoon. Of course you got to use the olive oil so they don't stick and once that's done drain the noodles, but leave a little bit of water because its going to get soaked up over time and the noodles won't be dry and once you're about to use the packet to season it,  season it and stir it in small amounts to cover all the areas.
last girl the only sensible 🤨🤨 yall forgettin ramen goes With Broth
Marcus had NO MERCY.
Yuh '
Curly haired girl omaewamou shindeiru
the cheeta print girl is SOOO ANNOYING complaining about others when hers is the WORST

Cheyanne has the best looking and. Olu’s is way to dry might as well eat it hard. AND Marcos is to mushy
Always the one with the most to say that has the nastiest food
I love how the cheetah print girl was hyping up her ramen so much but everybody thought it was horrible 💀
The last one was the best put of all of them.
She said she prefers her ramen dry but before when she was tasting his she said it dRy like In a tone like ughhh
how do you fuck up ramen?
We just gone ignore how all them black & the title says “ broke college kids “ 🤨 if those were white people would the title be the same ?
Why does they’re ramen look like that? It look dry, all it’s supposed to be a soup
Why tf nobody talking about why they eating ramen with a damn spoon😂
"Where they went wrong?" "When they woke up, and decided to make it."
I dont understand why they are so bad at making ramen like bruhh its easy to make
She talked all that shit and still lost hahahahaha
The Nigerian girl talking sh yet hers is dry 😂😂😂  She prefer her noodles dry!

Before the challenge: Poofy hair chick: mine is the best I’m gonna win
Caption☠️☠️😹
Shrimp ramen and a LITTLE bit of soy sauce... AMAZINGGGGH
The guy “LOOK ITS A CLUMP” LMFAOOOOO YO I CANT
What does that curly haired girl except?!?? Y'all broke you can't except some meal made by Gordon Ramsay tf
2:42 nah ma'am that's on your own taste buds because you "spice" up every fucking meal so much that the taste buds got fucked up.  I'm not surprised to see people who season every little thing to find natural flavoured things disgusting after a while but that's fully on them then.
My favorite is chicken flavored ramen, boil it and drain so you have no broth. Put half a packet of the seasoning and then mix in pepper Jack cheese while still hot. Or, the drained noodles, some seasoning, peanut butter, and sriracha
Ok is it just me or they forgot how to make noodles orrrr what??
....I hope they know ramen has broth 💀
idgaf about the picky one or the fact that it has no broth...WHY TF THEY GIVE THEM SPOONS
this video is wrong in all levels
I wanna see Asians do this
How can she afford shrimp if she's broke!!!!???????
WHO IN THE GAY HELL EATS RAMEN WITHOUT FREAKIN BROTH
I cook it for about 3 min then add crushed red peppers,chicken seasoning,7 pats of hot sauce, and paprika.Idgaf I like my mouth burning
Me, part japanese, listening to them complain how wet their ramen is 🌚
Should’ve put a Hawaii kid in the mix
“Season the Raman”   Wasn’t she the same girl who complained about it being salty!?! 💀
2:39 she gets on my nerves for no reason 😑
She better win,  them other 2 making dry ass ramen 😂😂 Ramen is a soup not a cooked noodle
dang i eat it raw with 2 pinches of the seasoning
Where the broth at?!!
Lmao sissss talked all that shit cause she was African and no one ate her shit
These dry ass over cooked ramen makers hating on the wet(right)ramen I knew soon as I saw it hers would win it's the only one cooked right
NIGERIAN SPICES? YES YES YESSS
if you tried my ramen, you would die cus its so immaculate.
Shrimp is a pretty expensive ingredient for someone who is broke
If I looked that good I would also be that arrogant 😶
All of their ramen looks awful.
It's really how really japanese ramen or ramen in general has broth and y'all out here eating it dry where the flavor coming form or to keep your noodles flavorful. I could see if they did stir fry noodles 🤣🤣
Man. If they putting shit in their ramen than they aint poor.    Poor is just strictly the seasoning package and a good portion of water to fill the rest of your belly up. The struggles be real!
Do people not realize Ramen is a noodle broth dish? Like, bruh. You can do so much with ramen
I was taken back like... how tf is this broke ramen when y’all adding chicken and shrimp to it.. we was broke!!! No chicken or shrimp for our ramen... tf this should be called cheap privileged ramen.. 😭🤷🏽‍♂️
Talkin bout color like they’re all professional CHEFS it’s COLLEGE RAMEN 🤦🏽‍♀️ second of all it’s ..a ..SOUP it’s supposed to have “WaTeR” (broth) here’s my ramen!! Add some WaTeR throw that seasoning packet in there BAM that’s all u need y’all bein extra out here makin CRUNCHY RAMEN tf😂
University of Bridgeport !!

It always be the ones taking smack and hyping themselves who have the shittiest rating 😂
“Are you trying to kill meEee?” 😭 Me: you’re the one who agreed to this

My gf used to crushed all of the ramen in the bag till they were almost crumbs and then boil them then drain all the water out of them and had like mush.. that no not water. Ramen is supposed to have water. Y’all haven’t seen Naruto!? At least my gf seasoned it but still
All this ramen is dry because its supposed to be in a broth 🤣
The person who yeah talks never wins
Where tf is the broth Ik y’all got water
Is no one talking about how they are eating ramen with a spoon!!!!! You’re supposed to use a fork!!!!
I wonder how they would react trying actual Ramen, the traditional kind. I want Ramen now.
why they using spoons to eat ramen tho lmaoo
Dry noodle girl had the most to say💀
Oh this is much worse than I thought it would be.
Why are these two people acting like ramen isn’t supposed to have broth like what?
That olu girl was trying to hard... she made sure we knew she was Nigerian, she called everything except hers bad💀
Do they not know there is soup ramen

Biggest shit talker always the worst rated
The girl with the afro hand CHUNKY RAMEN HOW DO U MAKE RAMEN CHUNKY
Everyone knows Nigerians can’t cook. Like ew, that’s so dry. Anyways I’m Liberian 🇱🇷
What was the point of saying "broke". Like chill out
5:38 she gotta be eating the ramen straight outta the pack
nigerian girl: "looks kinda dead" me: looks kinda dry. really dry
3:21 I DEADASS THOUGHT THEY INCLUDED THE PERSON WHO MADE THE RAMEN’S REACTION
DAMN BRO I WAS WAITING FOR THEM TO TALK SHIT AB HOW THEIRS DIDN'T WIN WHAT, WHERES THE FLAVOR
I’m sorry but on what planet is your ramen dry and not wet like olu’s ramen doesn’t even cooked it looked like she just got it out of the packet and put it in a bowl
Ay Nigerian girl might not be able to make ramen but damn she beautiful
its not ramen without soup its just japanese fucking pasta holy shit
6:15 isn't ramen suppose to have at least some "water"
“too watery” AYO THATS THE POINT OF A BROTH
My ramen:  1.Crush it up in packet 2. Put it into a bowl 3. Put water (covers the ramen) 4. Put the seasoning packet 5. 2:30-3:00 6. If I'm feeling fancy I'll take it out at 2:30, put 3 slices of cheese, and put it back in for 30 seconds.  I'm not even in college yet
i like how they are all black and broke😂
It’s salttyyy are you trying to killlll me
"The ramen's a bit watery"  Well... I mean... ramen has broth...
RAMEN IS SOUP! IT NEEDS WATER
The girl with the puffy hair is annoying aff
bruh olu gimmie very much pick me vibes😭
I can tell that they either haven't eaten ramen in a while or never had to because theres no way you just mess it up this bad with the exception of Cheyenne. She had the right idea going on. Personally, I would have added some veggies and fried the ramen noodles w/some scrambled eggs into the mix.
Her:My mom is Spanish... Me: 👀...Okayy No!
I guarantee half of the people in the comments make better ramen then all 3 of them
I’m so sorry, but Olu was SO annoying.
It’s literally called ramen noodle SOUP... there’s no soup sis.
Bruh my ramen be just the packet with some extra garlic salt, chicken bullion and extra broth bc RAMEN IS A SOUP PEOPLE.
Ramen is supposed to have broth and i stand by that
YOU KNOW WHAT RAMMAN LIVES MATTER
did they really complain about ramen having... BROTH???
Girl.. it’s soup... wym it’s watery LMAOOO
5:38 Little Bit ? *I Think Not*
girl w/ the curly hair called out the dude's ramen for being to dry. Hunny idk if you could tell but yours war so dry it was still in chunks
full proof ramen recipe:   1. lightly, like a tiny tiny pinch - season the water with salt  2. cook noodles until al dente, drain most of the water but leave enough for the noodles to have room to float (about 1 cup, maybe 2)   3. add the seasoning pack (you don't have to use it all, I usually use half-ish but I'm just being mindful of sodium)   4. add 1/4 tsp butter or less, 1/4 tsp sriracha (or more if you need spice in your life)  5. mix them up and the broth should be slightly coloured from the sriracha, very appetizing when food has colour! (more to come)   6. thinly slice green onion (see more colour) and sprinkle on top, shake on some sesame seeds and seaweed flakes. And ~voila~   that's just good on its own, or a building base for added mushrooms, bacon, egg, pork belly, cheese etc. And the best part?? ITS CHEAP, you can be broke and eat good! (I know no one asked for this, but maybe it'll save some lives cause this video had me very concerned - except Cheyenne she knows what shes doing keep it up)
That's why there 99 cent store , dollar tree , dollar general etc. To get more for ur buck . speaking for the true broke people experience...
can the curly hair girl not only talk about herself? Like ur trying OTHERS not urs.
They acting like they in the master chef where the fuck Gordon Ramsey
All they ramen look dry, where's the soup? 😟
The girl in the cheetah print needs to go, she gives me spoiled, needy, selfish, and egotistical vibes
how do you fuck up *instant* ramen 😂
Doing all that talking and you came dead last lmao
Do they think ramen isn’t supposed to be wet ? Traditionally you’re supposed to eat it with the water cos it’s like noodle soup with the flavouring
How tf do you not eat ramen with broth.
why she said it’s too salty then say it don’t have seasoning... is it no seasoning or too much seasoning? 😭
Girl in cheetah print and boy obviously havent tried traditional ramen bc that ramen was not that watery
"I like my noodles on the dry side" bitch I can tell all you did was open the pack and put it in da bowl with some spices
Why did you have to say "Broke"
They are all fucking annoying
You can tell they really weren't that broke
*It's everything for me*
was it just me or NONE of them looked appetizing..

why is it only blacks? is this channel a black supremacist channel?
Lol everyone is picky . I didn’t know we could ALL BE BROKE AND PICKY LMFAO
Y'all talking about cheetah print girl but I'm just here wondering WHY THEY GAVE THEM SPOONS ??
"whoever made this tried" miss gurl yours went throught a sandstorm-
Did you cook it ?? is the real question . The girl with the cheetah print shirt .
Here’s how I make my ramen. *what you need* - 2 pots (one small and one medium) -2 eggs -water  *how to cook it* - start by adding the water into the pots and bring it to a boil.  -as the water is going to a boil take two eggs and separate the egg whites from egg yolks (DO NOT BREAK THE YOLKS)  -once the water in boiling in the medium pot I add the seasoning the ramen came with and cook it down.   -once it is cooked down I add the egg whites into the ramen with out draining the water (add it little by little so it doesn’t clump up)  -in the small pot add your egg yolks and let the outside of them become a light yellow but make sure the inside of them are still runny.  -take your ramen with the cooked egg whites and strain it (the seasoning should be cooked into the noodles)  -put the ramen into a bowl and top it with the egg yolks. You can add more seasoning like chili powder if you want. Experiment a little and see what you like.  -I like to pop the egg yolks and mix it in but you can eat it alone.
I’m sorry but how is the happy headed cheetah print girl trying to gate keep ramen 💀
Ramen is supposed to have water wtf lmfaoo

Uh no eggs? Or vegetables? Made me sad 😣
So no one gonna talk about how they be eating noodles with a spoon
Wtf ramen is suppose to have broth
"The ramen is watery" ramen is literally noodles in soup lmao
And why they complain about the water??? Wtf 🤦‍ just buy pasta and leave ramen noodles alone . They are supposted to be with more water than the last girls bowl . I hate crunchy ramen noodles like.. whats the point? U haven't eaten and u don't feel full that's all.
I fucking hate that olu girl
Lmao that was not ramen at all , the best thing be the juice
"my first instinct is to smell it so i know im not eating anything bad" girl you dont need to be worried abt shit with those bricks you be eating
Whoever dislikes the vid... probably doesn’t like Juice WRLD
And yet here i am with fully paid job and i found 5 ramen for 99 cents and i bought it so hell yeah i have food :D
I been broke I been rich I’m still eating ramen best food u can get for 20-50 cente
Bro the Curly hair girl so over confident and then she gets ROASTED.
i only like the girl with braids
how do u like dry ramen then say its to dry
Is it normal to eat ramen with a spoon or?
*Laughs in Asian*
Olu was such a hater 😂🤣🤣 it’s always the ones that hype their food up TOO MUCH that lose 😭
The Cheetah girl really overhyped her noodles
They dont beed to add the word "broke" here  Just college  student justifies  it all
i couldn't do this ever. i would be so hurt bye.
When I looked at the curly hair girls attitude and food, I thought it was a alien
how does your RAMEN CLUMP??!??!?!!?
The curly haired girl thinks she was the best, but it looks dry and crunchy
*Omg this is salty like are you trying to kill me? *crie** -Spoiled brat from Gacha
6:58 She said next like there was more ramen 😭
Her ramen was drier than my future
I'm getting sick and tired of watching ANYONE trying each other's food. Everyone they pick are serious haters and can barely boil water. Also having only 3 people is really not enough to establish a common census.
The SHADE 😹 When you're broke AS*F but GOT that confident ... P-E-R-I-O-D-T
Where is the butter
damn their not good their legit eating ramen with spoons
Why they say broke black college kids that's wrong
I wanted to see Olu's reaction when she found out she made THE WORST ramen ever. She was so confident that she would win.
girl u dont know how to make ramen i dont think u should be judging other peoples
All the people who says they hate everybody else’s always has the worst ones
Why are they eating it with a spoon..?
That girl had to be trolling
Cheetah print was mad annoying bro
shiiiid they need to try mine
I'm really confused as to why they're complaining about it being "watery"... Ramen is soup
The fact there all black 🙇🏾‍♂️
Ramen 👏🏽is 👏🏽usually 👏🏽a 👏🏽soup 👏🏽noodle👏🏽 fuck are the first two dishes I’m sorry ??!?

RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER IN IT GET CULTURED PEOPLE PLEASE 😭😭😭😭🔫🔫
Wtf was That other girl talking about her ramen was dry af
I eat my ramen with the water it, it keep it warm and I drink it too
“the ramen is a bit watery” ramen is soup it’s supposed to be watery.
When you talk shit your plate comes out the worst.
"add some color, it looks kinda dead"  Miss Girl- it goes in your mouth and you eat it, ramen isnt supposed to look colorful, its litteraly a noodle soup, get out of here with your dry ass ramen-
WHY THE HELL ARE THEY GONNA EAT DRY AS HELL RAMEN WTF RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH SOUP MOST OF THE TIME THESE BR0KE KIDS BE DOING IT ALL WRONG SMHHHH
YOUR SUPPOSED TO ADD STUFF TO RAMEN?                          I been eating it like....regular......👁👄👁
Olu was too confident, marcus had too much smack to talk.
honestly, just adding the seasoning pack and doing exactly what the ramen pack says on the back (adding how much water, cooking for how long etc.) will probably taste better than any of these that attempted to put all kinds of ingredients and seasoning in it. And yes, most ramen are served in broth
RAMEN IS A FIJCJCJUBG SOUP WITH NOODLES
The Nigerian girl was waaayyyy to cocky and talking trash about the others when hers out here looking like it woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Like just bc you african and black dont mean you cans season yo food. (and b4 yall call me racist im also black and african)
Do those two know that ramen is literally soup
ALL LOOKED NASTY
The girl with curly hair is so broke she can't afford water
They have to know that ramen is a soup based dish.
Ramen don’t hit like it use to
Honestly black people love there noodles....But I ain't having any unless you make it right.🤣
hi that's not ramen that's instant noodles
2:06 are you trying to kill me engh I didnt like it
RAMEN HAS BROTH !!!! Anything less is a travesty
I disliked just bc of the cheetah print girl- holy shit I can't stand her.
oluwamayowa wtf
nigerian girl was a pick me girl 🤦🏽‍♂️
Irish people try each others corned beef and hash
I am a college student who is watching this while literally eating instant noodles ...how typical of me
Me seeing plp using spoon to eat noodles: my eyes!
I’m glad Cheyenne won she’s was the nicest one there
No ones gonna talk about the fact they’re using spoons and not forks
why did they give them a spoon
How is this broke ramen if they're adding chicken and shrimp to their ramen 😬😬😬
Wait Ramen is "supposed" to be soup right? I didn't know people drained the water out.

Remen

If they wanted drier ramen....eat noodles....a lot of ramen usually have soup bases WHAT lol
I'm just trying to figure out why they ramen was so dry
Where’s the white strugglers

Ramen is suppose to have water, no water no quality, no quality no standard, no standard no success. *Periodt*
dry ramen gang VS. actual human
curlyhead sis said hers was the best and got last place🤨
Ramens mf soup lmaoo
Olu tried to lowball everyone else and her ramen looked like that?
The ramen is supposed to have water in it wdyfm
*"My mom vibes. My mom is Spanish"* 😩
They are broke? Broke people being Ultimate critics like they are some food connoisseur just doesn't do for me. Take your bougee ass elsewhere.  My ramen: Instant curry ramen with spiced sunny side up egg and wafers on the side. I can literally make it here in less than 2 dollars.
I DON'T THINK RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT DRY😭
You guys for sure get money to do all this stuff.. to be more “interesting”
"I don't like ramen with water"  What the fuck do you think ramen is? Japanese pasta?
😂 I'm a college student and I add grated cheddar cheese or fried eggs to my ramen. And it must have broth, always.
They claim they from the struggles though if you really been through it you and I've been eating those noodles right up they never been down bad I can't believe how much there are full of theirselves thinking they got the best ones even though all that s*** is wack as f***
WHAT DID THEY EXPECT?!?! ITS RAMEN AND THEYRE BROKE IN THE SCENARIO
Get the chicken flavor ramen cook it put the packet in get some yum yum sauce and hot sauce and butter best thing you will put in your mouth btw it has to be Frank’s red hot sauce
nigerian spices ain’t saving yo disgustin excuse for a simple food
Damn I want too see the reactions at the end that’s lame
I like how the cockey ones dish was the one no one liked.
Wow who woulda thought the person who calls themselves “African goddess” is the most annoying and judgmental.
lmfao i love how the guy talked smack about the "watery' ramen nd then he ate nd was like iTS GOOD WTF-
Lmaoo a zero on ramen
YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE IN BROTH. your supposed to get different ramen. Bruh these people should just buy a big pack of miso soup and it's just 2 dollars.

I'm so grateful to live in a wealthy family and go to college at home😭💖
Cheyenne is SOOOOO beautiful omggggg Edit : They're both super cute actually
I don't like brothless noodles it was very weird for me to move to uni and realize I'm actually the odd one cause most people actually eat their noodles dry like pasta.
As an asian, we eat maggi, idk what this dry ramen thing is
6:12 this nigga look like the pbs sid the science kid

It’s always the ones who got the most to say that have the worst dish
The thumbnail made me click lmao
Ramen is supposed to have broth...   Edit: When I make it I add a lot. Green onion, sesame seed and oil, bean sprouts, msg, egg, a tad bit if soy sauce and a dash of brown sugar makes it savory
I respect a range of ramen broth preferences & even switch mine from time to time—but like if u gon be commenting on someone’s ramen being WATERYYY at least mention the fact that u know it’s “supposed to be ramen” Lmaoooo
Eats ramen with a spoon
Do they know that ramen is suppose to be in soup? There are specific noodles that are dry and thats how you eat but thissss?
yall out here eating noodles wit no water ?? cant be tht broke
People who criticize food for 15 minutes before actually tasting it
"i like my ramen dry" so pancit?????????
“The chicken is just the accessory” THEN WHY DONT U EAT UR HAIR HUH CAUSE THAT COULD BE RAMEN TOO   ALL THAT COMPLAINING U DOING  DANG
AHAHAHAHAAAAA I KNOW SHE NOT BEING WHITE RN  THE CHEETAH GIRL JUST SAID SHE ABSOLUTELY HATED THE GUYS DISH CAUSE ITS SALTY  WHEN SHE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT ALL THEM “GOOD GOOD” SPICES ABOUT HER DISH  IF U DONT GOT SALT U DONT GOT NO BLOOD PRESSURE MK BOO SO STOP PLAYING   I WILL GLADLY REMOVE YOUR BLACK CARD SINCE U WANNA BE PETTY OVER SALT.
“My ramen is coming in with a different vibe”   Honey the vibe was NeVeR tHeRe~   And why she acting like the girl with the braids might not be Nigerian like she never know sis don’t assume where black people come from or have relatives to 😐🤚
Curly hair girl talk smack and she was mad picky then she pulls out a dry clumpy trash ramen 😂😂😂😂😂
I can see why the fro girl is broke cause she spent all that money on her makeup got her face looking like a reflection of sun on water
Doesn’t ramen use water
The girl with the curly hair is like Gordon Ramsey “it’s dry” then the next person “it’s to wet” and Gordon Ramsey says “it’s burnt and raw”
Dont miss being a broke college student
I feel like in all these videos there’s always that one person that’s a pure hater and refuses to even find something good to say about anyone else’s dishes 😂😂 then it turns out their dish was the worst😂
TBH none of those even have broth. I dont know if you can count the girls w/ the braids ramen as broth
omg season the raaaamen cmon season the raaaamen
The Nigerian gir: ooh! It’s too salty for me... oh no the noodles aren’t season enough...  “Oh it had flavor it’s just bland so it’s a 2 for okay bye”
The most vocal one is almost always the loser lol
Ramen actually has soup
what is wrong with marcus and olu
“I like mine a little more dry..”    Yeah we can see that..
2:27 the eye roll PLEASE miss cheetah girl stoppp its ramennn😭😭
My name is Cheyenne too  OMGGG
Okay but the thing that bothers me the most is that they’re using SPOONS?!?!?
No matter how broke I get I will never make my ramen like this. Maybe the shrimp one, just maybe if I'm having a real bad day but yeah I'd rather die than eat some dry ass ramen.
Why didn’t nobody give them a fork
bruh all that ramen was straight up wrong
Why they eating it with a spoon?!!!?
You guys need to watch some prison cooking tutorials. Those guys can make a whole feast out of ramen.
Ramen is supposed to have liquid in it. it’s literally the broth that gives it flavor.
to be honest, the ramen packets are already really salty so you shouldn't really be adding seasoning that will enhance the saltiness... like salt. unless you really enjoy salt. idk lol
Was the grl wit da afro tryna make future wit rameb
These guys stupid... That's not called ramen they're just eating noodles
who tf eats ramen with a spoon?
"There's not enough shrimp it needs more" Well, uh, it's BROKE college ramen.
Omyloorrrn do they not get that ramen is usually is supposed to have soup🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Bro y’all.. don’t like broth? Weird.
Says it’s salty but goes Nd says it has no flavor
Omg Cheyenne is so sweeet and so beautiful!
ramen is struggle meal . ive been makin ramen inna pot inna microwave cup of  boilin water yall ramen look nasty asl
I'm offended that I was not invited. I make the best ramen hands down
You could tell the one girl with the braids came into it already deciding she was going to like anybody else's
Sooo I learned that people can’t admit when they like something even just a little if they’re in the competition.
y’all eat dry ramen like that ???
i’m sorry but olu sounded like a robot
So we not gonna talk about how they gave them spoons
Who eats their ramen DRY like what “water”??? No broth
Cheetah print on my nerves
A 3
not a college student but my favorite way to eat top-ramen is making it as usual, dump out some of the water, put a bit of milk in it and the seasoning as well as some cheese. basically mac & cheese but its sooooo good. but it HAS to be chicken flavor !
feel like they forgot ramen soup... ramen isn't always just ramen noodles :)
I need to make some of this for my snack
girl in da cheetah print bruh she finnnnneeee
First girl is SO pretty
i only liked the girl with braids😐👍
am i dumb? are we not supposed add water? too ramen? also where that shrimp and crayfish come from ARENT YOU SUPPOSED TO BE BROKE??
Why are the broke college kids black???
what triggers me the most is the fact that they are eating ramen with a spoon
I like mine brothy! Apparently not everyone likes that, but shit, I like soup dammit! If I can sometimes I add broccoli and Korean dumplings with some hot sauce! That's a full meal, I'm not eating for the rest of the day!
I’m i the only one that eats ramen with broth?
asians has left the chat
I knew she was gonna take the cake. Not because you’re “african” doesn’t mean everybody is going to like your seasonings and I’m tired of telling people this over and over again
How they be broke and afford shrimp??!
I love my noodles with water it’s like soup and a meal at the same time!! Eww why would she put crayfish in it?? Disgusting
2:45 that girl says his ramen is dry but then later says she likes her ramen dry 😭 whattt
give ya a hint… beef ramen, pepper, touch of old bay, tapatio and if ur feeling lucky some shredded cheese ;)
Did they forget ramen has broth💀
Why does it seem like the one who is the worst, has the most to say😂
just how hard is it to cook instant noodles??? that olu girl clearly has never had good food in her life
how is it hard to make normal ramen tf
The girl with the fro really annoying and didn't even make sense please don't bring her back
DO YALL NOT EAT UR RAMEN WITH THE BROTH-? (that gives it f l a v o r)
"Where your fork? Where your chopsticks? And why your ramen dry? Haiyaahh" - I legit can see Uncle Roger saying this.
No way she came to the show with un cooked ramen and talked about how the other person ramen didn’t have taste.... humble ya self 😂
She thought she was going against white kids😂
Are these guys saying they just eat dry ramen
I just found out when people eat ramen they take out the broth... I thought everyone ate it with the broth??
As a Louisiana resident I wanted to barf every time I heard CRAYFISH
Olu had a lot to say yet her noodles were for 1 dry asf, & crunchy...who crushes up the ramen???? & wtf was in it rice? oatmeal?  *edit* WHO TF EATS DRY RAMEN??? THEYRE NOODLES IT IS MEANT TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF BROTH OR SAUCE
Notice how there all black
It would actually be a challenge if they had asians
i hate olu
“It’s too dry” Yet yours has clumps in it???
this shit look dry as hell - marcus
Cheyenne was my favorite, SHE ACTUALLY LEAVES THE BROTH IN! THE BROTH IS THE BEST PART
this is disgraceful to actual ramen like have they never had real asian food like ramen is supposed to have WATER it's a freaking broth like wth
What they mean they want it dry Ramen is a a soup not a pasta
Miss olu was a little to confident LOL
RAMEN HAS WATER
i think these people have never made ramen right in their lives. you eat it dry?? no broth???? it’s just noodles at that point my guy.
Did people forget that ramen is SUPPOSED to have water Orr is there just something wrong with me
“I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry” nooo reallyyyyyy💀
“ my first instinct is to smell it, to make sure I’m not eating anything bad” girl yours was bad 🤣
I’m sorry but I eat my ramen like the last part😂
why does my ramen look better when literally all i do is follow the instructions on the instant ramen packet
do these people know what ramen is????
All their Ramen was wack😂how do you fuck up something so simple💀💀
Are they dumb? Ramen has broth wdym water good lord
Olu was annoying ash
they eating ramen with a god damn spoon 😂
ramen is supposed to have broth-
if i’m eating samyang (idk if that’s how u spell it) spicy ramen i won’t put water but if it’s like the beef ramen from top ramen or that marchuen something brand i keep the water in
All that shit is trash tbh
"It's salty" girl ramen is pure sodium
yall eating cracker ramen how can you have no broth
Bro I make high school broke ramen better than this.
BUT YOU USULLY EAT RAMEN WITH "WATER" I'M SO CONFUSED
Umm i make it better than all of them and im younger
The way I watched the first girls name so I could pronounce it correctly 😩 I’m on mobile so I can’t pause and type to get the spelling right : /
Bro where’s the soft boiled eggs, the spam, kimchi, seaweed, tofu, msg..?, fuckin anything I mean at least the last girl had something but damn.
my top concern is why theyre eating ramen with A SPOON 😭😭
Rames has water. Noodles or pasta is the one that doesn’t have any water
Remen
they forgot its literally soup, if they had my ramen theyd probably cry because it has more than 1 ounce of liquid
Why they eating it with a spoon
We not gonna acknowledge how they used a spoon for ramen ?
WHY IS THE RAMEN DRY what is this
The olu girl was talking so much shit when I'm a middle schooler and can make It better was she complaining about the color?
That girl got every letter two times in her name in from the alphabet ....
olu shut up yours was crunchy miss girl.
WHO ITS RAMEN WITH A SPOON AND NO WATER TF ADD THE BROTH AND USE CHOPSTICKS!!! THIS SHUT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD ABT MY RAMEN JEEEEEEZZZZ
Lmao when broke girls taste becoming so broken they can’t even tell if their ramen is shit or not
"the ramens a bit watery-" WELL WTF RAMEN IS A SOUP NOODLE DUMBASS
I’ll stick with a spread.
Why do they keep calling the broth water???? “It’s a bit watery.” You serve ramen in broth!!!! What is going on?!?!?
Olu was lowkey annoying
I wanted that cheetah shirt girl to react to her score.
ramens color don't matter lol

Did they run out of forks? Why is my girl Cheyenne eating with a spoon 😭
“look it’s a clump” 🤣

I was just watching this video thinking why they’re being so judgmental about each other’s ramen, I mean I know it’s a competition but 😭

Does broth like just not exist to them 👩🏽‍🦯
That one girl was annoying, she had all that junk to say when sis got a 2 💀!! I mean come on man, at least TRY your own damn food before pubic humiliation like this. lmaoo
Asian chiefs rn: 😐😐

she talking about it’s salty yet the only thing that had flavor was the chicken and he needed to add seasoning to his ramen- girl make up ur mind

the cheetah girls face when she realised her ramen wasnt the bet
AS AN ASIAN, I'M OFFENDED KEYSOWUSKSJSLDJDOW

We love to support our international babes, but Olu.... honeyyyyyyy 💀😂😅
the girl with the cheetah print is that kids in school who thinks she is the best
5:36 That one didnt age quite so well
the 3rd one had the best ramen cause of the broth imagine eating ramen with no broth lmaoooooo
"omg it's salty" visco girls bro I swear
next time do a close up on the ramen i wanna see too lmao
I like my ramen dry too
All I do to my ramen is drain pretty much all the water first after cooking, add some milk, put the packet in an add some chili powder, taste the best with the chicken ramen
Why those two complaining about ramen being... WATERY????
Ramen is literally only good with water in it otherwise it’s dry af
Ramen is suppose to have BROTH wtf you think ramen is😂😂
“I like my ramen pretty dry” we can tell-
All of them look nasty.....
I know y’all didn’t like the curly haired girl but FLAVOR THE RAMEN has me forever
Why are they all black kinda racist
These kids had me DYING when they complained about the broth in the ramen
T
Why soooo dry looking
Why do they all look shit is this how people really make ramen
“The ramen is watery “ RAMEN IS SOUP 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🍜🍜🍜
No way cheetah girl was an actual broke college student 😃😃 she don’t even know how to make ramen 😭😭😭😭
there something call bowl noodle cup noodle  they have water and some dont
i can always tell whos shit is gonna be the worse .. olu is pissing me off
All of they ramen suck ain't got no broth.
Talking about “she go win” 😭
We all know the ramen the girl with braids made is ✨AMAZING✨
theyre acting like ramen is just the noodles.
They might as well just take the noodles dry
It’s called crawfish not crayfish
sooo  they dont put the broth in the ramen?
Bruh all the ramen looked trash. Except for the girl with the braids maybe. The noodles looked uncooked because they probably arrant seasoning the water directly. If you season noodles it’s going to dry up. The girl w the curly hair just, didn’t cook it. At all.
Ramen is noodles with soup butttt okayyyy😬😬😅
I am sorry but the  top ramen I but from Walmart and make on my stove top with in 2 mins could win over all there ramens and I 100% only added water and a broth packet .
Lmao title kinda did em dirty
My ramen recipe:  Boil noodles with exactly enough water so you don’t have to strain it While boiling add one egg  Mix egg and noodles together then turn off heat  Add spice packet plus adobo plus extra dried chives on top  Voila
Olu is one of thoes black aunties that rave about there potato salad, then no one eats it out the cook out, just uninvite her at this point
Olu: " I like my ramen a little dry.." GIRL WE KNOW
But can we just talk about the title for a sec I-
Curly girly *adds black ppl ingredients* Me:but isn’t it Asian?...🥴
her: mine is actually seasoned and has FLAVOR" them: 🤮🤢🤢
my ACTUAL broke college tamer recipe. Get a mug, get water. Heat the water in the dorm microwave for 3 mins. Next poor it into the maruchan chick flavored cup.  Wait.  When it’s done put some Valentina sauce to flavor and yeah.
where the fuck you find these people bruh 💀
LMFAOAOAO
Always the ppl who talk the most shit that got the worse food
I love the girl with braids. But my ramen the best ion gaf🤣🤣🤣
As a Nigerian.. I'll never make my noodles like that💀
They do realize Ramen is literally supposed to be a soup with a lot if veggies and meat add ons in it( I realize they broke college kids but I buy alot of veggies cheap and kill my own animals to eat so I spend like 10 dollars at most for my Ramen and even get to have leftovers) 😅
They’re complaining about the only person who actually made ramen because it’s “too watery” and “not dry”....do y’all know what ramen even is
broke ramen recipes taste good for only the person that made it. change my mind
2:02 girl ur literally eating ramen that is basically all sodium what do u expect
Wtf are they eating. Why the ramen look so chunky nd dry. Where’s the liquid??!?
The fact that the curly head girl was talking mad shit about the other student ramen noodles and her ends up being nasty😂😂
everything in this video screams uncultered
Love that you had to specify that they are broke
Yall should post reactions of after they found out they lost
Y’all ramen is a literal soup ofc there is water in it 💀💀💀💀
uh- ramen with a spoon?
Wow the title
The Asians are crying right now
when tf did they say this was a competition
I feel like olu won’t honest about her ratings at all..she just wanted hers to win :/
afro girl mad annoying

The third girl is th only one who knows who knows how ramen/soup is supposed to look like like who eats ramen dry ew no hat

“the ramens a bit watery” bro. 🍜 < do you see that.
As a Nigerian thats, not our noodles trust me it's better it has egg atta gungun and shrimp
I already knew that curly haired girl was gonna lose Bc she can’t even say ramen properly

olu was annoying idc idc
Why they Greased "Broke"
“i would prefer my ramen a little more dry” GIRL BE QUIET YOUR RAMEN WAS CLUMPY
yall did they forget that most ramen has BROTH-
It’s always the one who talks the most crap whose food be the worst.
I want to believe that Olu’s ramen was bad on purpose. I refuse to believe anyone eats their ramen like that lmaooo
I actually hate the cheetah print girl
She said I prefer my ramen dry i bet you do boo lmao
The girl with the afro was talking the most shit but got a 2 LMFAOOOO clownery

Bro y’all can’t cook for nothing
Does that guy have a pet duck?
well clearly none of these people know how to make ramen... where is the broth? where are the veggies? where is all the good stuff? ramen should not just be noodles, even if you're a broke college student you can at least grab some chicken broth and green onions srsly
The nigerian girl doesnt know how ramen works lol
I’m sorry but who eats ramen with a spoon 🤣
NONE OF YALL KNOW HOW YO MAKE RAAAAAMEN, naruto would be disappointed yo

Ramen ba yan or pancit canton? Ramen niyo walang sabaw 😭😭😭 tapos sasabihan pang too watery I can't
I'm sorry but ramen should be in a soup, if it's dry then you probably cooked it wrong 💀
Curly head was acting like she made the best ramen 😂
This is what happens when you talk bad about everyone & are too over confident 💀
the first girl was talking so much shit😭
Curly haired girl was your dad a college guy  because you sure cook like one
i wanna see cheetah girls reaction when she found out she didn’t win
ramen needs water 💀
Smart tip:get used college text books👍🏽
My ramen has a little bit of water in it so it is not dry. But I hate it like a soup. With all that soup water. To much
Girl it's ramen not the time to be boujee

do these people not eat ramen w the broth 😐
That curly head girl talking about everybody’s but hears look NASTYYYY🤢🤮
bruh them: yo why it got water in it me: cause thats ramen duh.
While watching this all I was thinking about is what the people who helped make the video were thinking about
How the one girl gonna say there's to much salt then say it ain't seasoned at all
Marcus’s ramen is exactly how I make mine 😋👑
Where do they get these people from....Dry Ramen? Daffuq. The spoon was a choice too but I guess the producers took them big clumps into consideration.
Okay I think everyone is IGNORING the fact that their eating NOODLES with a spoon...A SPOON
Why they eatin with spoons 😭
This looks worse then grub hub        Grub hub has better food smh
do people drain their instant ramen or something why is it so dry except for the winner's😭
That 2nd girl is funny got me dyinggggggggggg 😂
Marcus!!!! Ah man that’s soo awesome for him :))
The guy is actually annoying as hell
At the end of the day, all of their ramen looked unappetizing.
shrimp throughout the whole thing............HOW BROKE U REALLY?
"reh-men"
Girl in the middle did okay job! Props to her! But the other two.. y’all need to learn how to cook 😂
I like cats
Shawty with the cheetah print outta pocket son
I js wanna know why they eating ramen with a spoon 🧍🏽‍♀️
the girl with the cheetah print such a hater lmfaoooooo
Who calls ramen vibe lol
As soon as curly head started talking I knew her dish was gonna be trash LMAO
They’re so uncultured it’s embarrassing  Except the braids girl
It’s salty. “Season the ramen”
Ramen can't be watery.... ITS SOUP!!!!
Nothing on Asian Ramen facts
A little bit more dry bestie yours was a clump
The one with the Afro hair sort of thing is dramatic “You tryna kill me or sum?” Because of salt?!?! Also she says “I’m gonna win this” and loses by a LOT!!
Am I the only one who says oodle and noodles because My sister started trying to say ramen and my mama just be like what u talking about because she’s so used to us saying it the other way
y’all did her wrong but she was still talking smack 💀
lowkey dissed them with the title lol
Bruh cheyenne own is the only one that looks like regular ramen, my ramen always has that amount of water
Why would you give them a spoon to eat RAMEN
The third girl really say I like my Ramen dry and I said I couldn’t tell
Im honesrly amazed any of them put extra stuff on thers because tbh when I was broke and on school i just put in the seasoning that came with the Top Ramen wrapping and some water and called it a day lol
One with the most broth wins. The world is in balance
So it’s “broke college students make noodles” not ramen. They’re crying about BROTH???? Uncultured!!!
First and foremost why are they eating ramen with a spoon???? Are they saying college kids cant afford a fork 🤔🤔
The spoons are pissing me off and all those noodles look nasty lol
Who’s broke and eating shrimp ?
Bruh the girl who talked the most shit got her ramen handed back to her😂
I came SPRINTING to the comments after the first review HAHAHAHHA
curly hair tried to say the boys ramen was too salty then she said it had no flavor like babygurl if you just wanted to win say that 😂😂😅
Dry Ramen should not exist. Change my mind.
Ramen is a noodle soup.. Isnt there SUPPOSE to be soup or otherwise what they call "water" 😂
It is supposed to be soup 😭😭
The ones that talk the most shit are usually the ones with the worst item 😂
I loved the girl w the braids
BRUH THE BOY AND THE NIGERIAN GIRL REALLY SAID THEY DONT LIKE THE WATER EVEN THO ITS THE BROTH AND MAKES IT TASTE GOOD LIKE JUST THROW BOTH OF THEM AWAY
why the hell do they not keep water in the noodles yall weird
In videos like this, the people who talk the most and the people say theirs is the best is always the worst one.
Why they eating it with a spoon doe
step 1: put ramen in bowl. step 2: put water in it. step 3: put it in the microwave. step 4:put it on for 3-5 minutes depending how high voltage your microwave is. step 5:dont do what the second girl did
"smells good, tastes good" but takes off almost half of the points for the noodle texture...? I'm pretty sure they didn't have to make it fresh but brought it from home, obviously the noodles will get mushier but that doesn't justify taking off 4 points girl was gagging for a reason to take off points, I rly gotta stop watching these cause there's always ppl in these who try to bs for the rating 💀
Why tf is it so dry. Where’s the broth
Idk if it’s just me but this ain’t “broke” college student ramen. BROKE college student ramen, is ramen with hot sauce. 😂
Oompa Loompa or whatever her name is seems like a bitch
brAh- just made normal ass ramen, like.. its VERY easy to make
Um I just buy maruchan ramen packets for 25 cents each
I'm amazed everytime I see ppl in America eating ramen and 99% of the time there's no broth 💀 like yes ramen noodles but ramen?
When they complained about  “water” being in a soup ....my guy wheet 😭🤌🏾 ??
The olu girl hers looked like chicken nuggets.
imo everyone was really extra. you don't need to add anything to ramen. ramen is a cheap, 1$ meal that will satisfy anyone... rather you're rich, poor, old, young, extra.
i just put salt and pepper and then the seasoning that comes in the package 😭 i add SO MUCH more water too
MISS GURL SAID SHE LIKED HERS DRIED OH WE KNOW
lol i'm surprised they could mess ramen up that badly, lmfao like bruh follow the instructions on the packet easy
It’s always the ones that talk to most shit that got the worst of anything lmao
My ramen is the best! I make bacon flavour and I put in shredded crispy pieces on bacon!
the fact my 9 year old brother makes better noodles than this - BRO MAKING NOODLES IS NOT HARD TO MAKEEE
the only one who knew how to make ramen was girl 3 , THE OTHER TWO JUST STRAIGHT UP BITE INTO THE RAMEN
Is there an auto unsubscribe and dislike button?
They gave them spoons...
"I prefer my ramen a little more dry" We know already
As broke and as an Asian, girl #3 with them beautiful braids (Chey) her ramen was more authentic, its supposed to have more liquid, as the liquid serves a purpose, to warm you up from the inside, also just add EGG, its cheaper than CHICKEN and SHRIMP. REEEEEEEEEAL TALK.
The mean one always being act hella special but hers always taste like shit
Everyone always hating on these.
watery is broth legit..
Those 2 said ramen was too watery .... WHAT ?!
Cheetah print girl is gettin on my last nerve she's so arrogant
Whew girl with the 4a wig was a savage. LMAO Also they aren't used to the water in ramen cause most black people don't make instant ramen like authentic japanese ramen.  We don't put our noodles in a broth. We drain it because it's put the flavor onto the noodles. With water, the flavor stays only in the water and doesn't stick to the noodles at all. Bland ass noodles are not fun y'all.
Bruh ramen is the SOUP AND THE NOODLES not just noodles they got people who’ve never ate or heard of ramen to do this 🤦‍♂️ smh
Imagine being the teacher of the first girl on the first day of school trying to pronounce her name💀
All three ramen looks plain, overcooked, and wrong lmao
Now why she she put that clump of ramen on the table😂😂😂
Okay I swear by this instant ramen recipe: Mr. Noodles beef flavour, a bit of soy sauce, sesame oil (this is key), and garlic powder. For toppings add a soft boiled egg, green onion, and nori. I also add some siracha for a tiny bit of spice (feel free to add any hot sauce).
“I would like my ramen a little more dry”  We can tell
I literally just put the chicken flavoring packet in
I- omg I thought ramen was actually a soup with noodles????! All my life I thought ramen was A SOUP WITH NOODLEs?
Remen is the new Ramen
WAIT WAIT WAIT DID YOU GUYS GIVE THEM SPOONS TO EAT *RAMEN* WITH??????
alu and marcus are weird with their dry noodles
BOTTOM LINE: they were all bad
Why are Blacks so confident, when they're good for nothing?! always confuses me.
I like my noodles a lil hard not mushy
How they doing a broke college video and wanting more shrimp tf?? THEY BROKE TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
When I don’t feel like cooking the ramen I just crush it, open the bag, grab the packet pour it in there and eat it like that, it’s sooo good
Cheetah print : too much salt  Cheetah print : SeaSoN the RaMen  😬😬😬
Should’ve had one African American, Latino, and white person.
Lmao the entire time I was wondering where the broth was at cuz I have broth with mine 😂😂😂
No water? Red color? Wassup wit them
The girl in the cheetah print shirt didn’t meet the vibe check. Ms. Gurl definitely giving pick me energy

Okay so all of them need help with their ramen lmao. I would have thrown a scrambled egg in mine, green onions, and some type of meat. And why dont they keep the broth??? That made me mad bc the broth is the best part.
Lol where the Valentina and lime combo .
5:37 no shit
why the fuck are they eating ramen with a spoon?
I’m simple: beef ramen with parsley, red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and Sriracha with fried eggs
Don't call this ramen, call it fried noodles or something like that
“ the ramen is a bit watery” ITS LITERALLY A SOUP
the african girl needs to humble herself
Monke                                                                         Pog
But who don’t like water in they noodles?
HOW  YOU GOING TO ACT LIKE RAMEN IS WEIRD WITH BROTH BRO
Them are petty af
it’s always the one who gets the lowest rating that has the worst food😭
Olu’s was giving me overcooked boiled rice.    Her hair was cute though.

Ramen is a damn soup damn they stupid
“i would prefer ramen a little more dry” don’t you mean ✨clumpy✨
okay but who eats their ramen without the water-
“The ramens a bit watery” Uhhhhh.....It’s fu*king Ramen
they were complaining about water being in the ramen when....it’s literally supposed to have water in it 😀
Lol ramen salty . Nah that’s not a thing
Ramen has broth, if you don't got the broth, it sure ain't ramen.
Might as well got the store bot 🍜
this whole video was ruined for me because they ate with a spoon
If you like seafood get the neoguri spicy seafood pack. Season some shrimp with Cajun or whatever seasoning you like on shrimp. Get the water and noodles allat stuff. Add the season pack and sweet pack when the water is boiling (y’all know the drill) then Pour like 1/3 of a cup of milk(heavy whipping cream) while the noodles are cooking then add green onions for a finishing touch. 🤌🏽thank me later.
They're broke but can afford shrimp? What? Lol
“Broke” lol
Yall really picked the most stereotypical Californians lol, "wack AF".
"My ramen is coming in with a different vibe" girl its literally just ramen calm down
so does their ramen not come with the lil powder chicken flavor packet??
Not the comment section absolutely DRAGGING cheetah print girl
Ramen is supposed to have soup-
1. They need a mix of different ethnicities. 2. Why they using a spoon to eat it?
something about it feels slimy,,,,,YOU MEAN THE DAMN S O U P SIR😭😭😭 GOOD NIGHTTTTT
Broke college kids my ass. 25¢ on ramen but willing to pay $6 for a drink
Curly head girl said that the guy Ramen was dry when the Only thing right was both of y'all ramen look dry the last girl new how to make ramen
WHY THEY’RE EATING IT WITH FKN SPOOON
"There is water in here." Me: Do you mean BROTH?!?!
This is how I make my ramen. Take a pan , tbspn of oil, onions and tomatoes browned a bit, add the seasoning , 2 & 1/2 cups of water, broccoli, carrots and peas then the noodles. Boil for another two mins and VIOLA !
LOLLLLLLLLL wow I learned from this video that my standards are low.
They’re so broke that they don’t know what real ramen is bro, that’s so sad lmaooo.
I wish we could see the reaction to their ratings 😂 very satisfying
As an Asian I’m majorly disgusted and disappointed with their “ramen”
These people never ran across ramen on TV or something and saw that it had a broth. Y'all stop calling it soup. It's BROTH. 😂
girl with the curly hair: “i prefer my ramen a little bit more dry”    WE CAN TELL
Olu dry noodle ass passing me off.  cocy ass i thought the noodles wasn’t even cooked .
How do you judge harshly when it's literally based on being a broke college student. 😐
"it feels slimy" ITS LITERALLY SOUP STFU
why do they like their ramen dry- it's literally soup tf-
im sorry but these people bother me so much and like what the fuck did they all make and also like y they eating with a spoon and playing with it.
"there's not enough shrimp" you're asking more shrimp from a BROKE college student ToT
Shrimp and chicken are kind of expensive...I just eat mine with the packet...
Why is the curly haired girl insulting others ramen as if shes a ramen connoisseur and this is coming from someone who is actually japanese
I like my ramen with the water
Dry ramen with a good enough bit of water but it’s like THE TINIEST bit crunchy is elite
I like quite dry ramen not too watery and a bit of salt but not where it’s intense and then not ALOT of flavour but definitely plain
bruh ramen  r a m e n, THERE'S WATER OFC
For the ones saying it’s too watery... they’ve clearly never had real traditional ramen 🤦🏻‍♀️
Stop saying rumon idiot
NORMALIZE LEAVING THE BROTH IK THE RAMEN
They talking about they don’t like the water, I’m laughing cause it’s just soup😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Not marooochon 😭
Who doesn’t eat ramen with liquid I don’t understand you’re supposed to add water to your ramen all of those looked nasty
He so annoying ..
do these people know what ramen is .-.
No one gunna talk about how they using a spoon?
Why are the contestants so mean?!?!?!? The only one who was nice was the one with the braids... and don’t even get me started on Olu
“ArE yOu tRyInG tO kILl mE?! UgH!”
LMAO I enjoyed this comment section more than I enjoyed the video 😭😭😭
“ArE yoU trYiNg to KiLl mE.?! UgH!” 🤣
I would’ve inhaled all of them except the 2nd one that one looked different
“The ramen is too water” ITS SUPPOSED TO BE??? RAMEN IS SOUP!!!!
I would’ve just brought the cup noodle & called it a day 😐😂
"Water" it's called broth. None of them are invited for Ramen night 🏌️‍♀️
My Ramen will be stir fried with some minced garlic, salt, pepper, msg 😏, mushroom soy sauce, thinly sliced pork meat, green onions or chives, little bit of bean sprouts and then top it off with some chili oil.....and little bit of crushed peanuts as well. It ain't the best but it is if I'm on a budget.
I love comment section where can all collectively hate someone 🤣
Olu was so cocky
this hurt my soul
Me: sees title  Also me: why you bully
What the fuck are these ramen? Do they not know ramen has a soup? What the fuck? I'm quite surprised.

the second hand embarrassment for the cheetah print shirt girl 💀💀
The other two be acting like ramen wasn’t supposed to have a broth😭😭
The girl acting like Gordon Ramsay
They need to do one where the cook something quick in real time..to see how they react to it fresh...cause these people is mean 😂😂
Tell me why they like they’re ramen without water T-T
Sometimes less is more y’all
cheetah girl: hmm i like my noodles a little more dry the other two plus the viewers plus the production team: WE KNOW-
Mines the best
bruh curly haired girl asked why there was water wtf, do you know what ramen is? And she's talking about color smh
How to make awesome ramen: 1 cook the noodles according to instructions (boil water and cook noodles for ~3 mins) 2 while the ramen is cooking, add the seasoning packet as well as some pepper to your bowl and mix around a little 3 when your ramen is done add the noodles only to your bowl along with about 1-2 tablespoons of butter and cover until the butter melts (butter should be room temperature) 4 the water, that you cooked your noodles in, over your now buttered noodles until it covers about half of the noodles and mix completely so that all the seasoning that’s currently on the bottom is now happily seasoning all the noodles 5 enjoy your noodles 🍝
Some shrimp what you mean I can only see one shrimp in there
Curly haired girl: I prefer my ramen to be a little bit more dry   We can tell 🧍‍♀️
why they all black
It’s supposed to be watery....
NONE OF THEM KNOW HOW TO MAKE RAMEN WTF 🤢
The Nigerian girl was just salty like chill 😭✋🏽
Girl 2 pissed me off
I used to live near university Bridgeport
the ramen is watery???? ramen is a soup WTF😂
As a nja girl...disgraceful❤ We add water here I swear
The chettah shirt girl talked smack and had the worse rating
Why are they eating it with spoons 😭😭😭😭
Shrimp and Chicken??? Broke where?? 😂
ramen has broth... its soup... why is everyone calling the "normal" one weird lol
Why not use chopsticks or atleast fork but WHY A SPOON and why does most of there ramen looks like it’s NOT EVEN RAMEN WHT THe-the second girl knows Wht ramen is but the cheetah pront and the guy doesn’t and RAMEN IS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A LITTLE WATER IN IT SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL BUT ITS HAS TO BE MOISTED AND NOT DRAY THW HATERS ARE THE ONES WHO CANT COOK ITS SAD
they made it wrong 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯 i got the best for you
“The ramen’s a bit watery”...because it’s Ramen! Tf!! Why do American people always butcher someone else’s food (although I don’t really consider that brand Asian food) lol. Ramen is supposed to be sitting in broth, it’s not a Damn pasta lmao 😂😂 I cannot..
These people be on youtube but cant even try to look up 'how to cook instant ramen' tutorials :>
Why do THWRE ramen looks like tht it’s rlly weird
Who eats ramen with a spoon?
Can someone please tell me if Cheetah girl grew up in Nigeria? Because there’s no way she would cook her ramen like that if she knew Indomie 😭😭😭
Please tell they are kidding, water?! Bitch RAMEN IS A SOUP
lets be real, none of this ramen looked good haha
pls ramen is supposed to have soup huh
i feel like olu was talking sm shit and rated everything rlly low so she can win but it didn’t work
Cheetah gurl....
The way they refer to it as "watery", thats the soup you're suppose to sip it.
I'm dead. They call the ramen "BROTH", water and it kills me, there is supposed to be some there. Ramen is not in clumps either for the cheetah print girl. The spices for the first girl would've been fine I think if the ramen was cooked properly with some freaking "BROTH"!!
“This is to salty, Come on guys season the Ramon “
"I don't like all the water" ....um...are they aware that Ramen is in fact a soup. I know I'm not the only one to comment but I had to say smth
Damn Cheyenne must be the only one who knows what Ramen is supposed to look like. You would figure if they eat it so often the would at least read the instructions on the back ...
What’s the point of these videos when we can’t even see their reaction to the ratings & what they said at the end? So dumb
Most Roman have a soup base so I don’t understand the liquid part why were they complaining
All the talk and that's what she brought over 💀
Olu was annoying as hell
I’m nigerian and I promise you our ramen ain’t like that 🍜
Tbh this is a bit embarassing
It’s not ramen if it doesn’t have soup, it would be just noodles
Ramen is supposed to have water
Soooo y’all neva seen or had ramen with water?? The cheetah print and the dude need ta shut up😭😭 wit y’all dry ramen. Looked malnourished af
From the time I saw Cheyenne's ramen got the broth I already knew she was gonna win😭🔥
why the hell are they bothered by the "water" in the ramen? ramen is supposed to have broth.
Tbh non of them look good
no soup? 😃 and they're using spoon? uhm
Sad thing is all they noodles was chunky.But the girl with the cheetah outfit on YOUR NOT SUPPOSE TO BE A BKE TO EAT NOODLES WITH YOUR FINGERS🤦🏾‍♀️
They were all mad just because the last girl actually made the ramen right The dude: "it dont look favorable at all but I guess I have to eat it". Like boi yours look dry its a soup?!
Y'all do know ramen is supposed to have liquid in it right? Like dont get me wrong I love dry ramen, but it's supposed to have a soup base.
People's tastes are sooooo different...🤣😂🤣
at least use a fork wtf
i didn’t know it was so common to just eat the noodles without the broth lmfao, need that shit to warm up your tummy
WHAT SHE TALKING BOUT COLOR??? ITS RAMEN

I am sorry I really hate the Nigerian girl... but all the ramen look bad.
PUT ME IN COACH!! These folks obviously never had ramen for breakfast lunch and dinner!

U gotta have cheese in the noodles
These people we’re cooking dry indomie - not ramen 🤭😭
Some of their attitudes were not it. The last girl’s ramen was the one I would actually eat. They walked to confident and it only paid off for the girl that was nice about it. The others looked so dry.💁🏾‍♀️🤨🥲
The most close minded group of ppl. Critiquing a cultural dish that 2/3 didn’t make right
“Sorry to that man” 🤣
“i prefer my ramen a little dry” well no sh*t sister lmao
They all should lose for using a spoon
..........
tf ramen is literally a soup-
The title tho 😂😂
Those are seasoned boiled and drained instant noodles. Not ramen. Please what's going on I'm confused. 😭
The one's who brag in this show are the one's who loses most of the time😂.
1:38 "the ramen I used was maroochan"

Horrible
Why is there no broth in any... please let me represent next time cause that was horrible
Real talk tho they did cheyenne dirty with the cover
This is the day I realized the existence of dry ramen
The first two forgot to put water in the ramen lmao
What's getting to me is why r they using spoons?

People don’t have broth with their noodles?
Cheetah print girl thought she was gone win 😭

So we not gonna talk about how all the “broke” kids are black -
I like how they have “broke” college kids and not just college kids in the title
Us asians being disgusted while in college with our metal water boilers/ heaters that we got from our parents. Us eating the good stuff from our mom. If ykyk

Nigerian girl reminds me of “where’s the flavor? Where’s the sugar nutmeg cinnamon?” girl
Isn’t ramen supposed to have broth/water in it 💀💀
Naaaa us Nigerians do NOT make ramen like that! We eat indomie alll the time (iykyk) and it definitely is wayy more moist lmaoooo wtf cringe
How is the Nigerian girl gonna talk about the boys ramen but not how funny her food looks and how ridiculous it is 💀💀
as an asian person, they tried but DAMNNN 😶
Bruh finally all I say was Noddles and seasoning but the last contestant actually had some liquid up in there
The girl with the cheetah print tho😭😭😭 save her
"The Ramen is a bit watery" WHAT DID SHE SAY???
Ramen should have WATER it's a noodle soup 💀😩
Moral of the story : don't be overconfident
Not me out here flooding my ramen and drinking the flavoured water after: ✨
this ramen is to wateryy ,,, the cheetah and glasses guy doesnt know what ramen is.... the other girl still did fine
Are we not going to talk about how there eating ramen with a spoon... 😀
why are they eating dry noodles? i thought they would add the water before eating or at least some sauce?
Parking and school books were her complaints? She annoyed me.
“Shout out to the shrimps that saved the day!” 😬
Who out here eating dry ramen, for real? It's supposed to be a soup. Y'all wild.
First off why tf are u eating noodles with a spoon 😑😑😑
i swear they bringing in annoying chicks on purpose
Why they eating the ramen with a spoon
She always wants to add atagoogoo and crawfish not “crayfish” ulo tried to think she the best cooker turns out she a doughnut
how tf ya’ll eat ur ramen like that? like just microwave it tF 🧍‍♀️
Looks kinda dead  Have you seen yours 💀
“Being a broke af college student” 2 seconds later “I added a fuckton of exotic spices to my ramen”
Where did it go wrong: her waking up
That cheeta print girl is annoying and she probably passed neuro science cuz her teachers tired of her *it’s my culture* bs
This comment section is making me feel embarrassed because I too eat my ramen without water 😬
They lucky i ant there i would had just gave a uncooked ramen pack hard like chips
Cheetah print girl is stupid 💀
Just eat indomie mie goreng. No need to add anything in it. It just sssooooooo gooodd🔥✨
The girl in the black top is soooo cute I love the way she talks
The cheetah print girl annoying as hell , her voice and all 😭
Ok but why are y'all eating it with a spoon
Americans are so weird what is that ramen why’s it that colour and have no broth the whole thing that makes ramen ramen is its broth
4:13 This girl shaking her head so much her neck might strain. Like we get it, you don’t know ramen.
spoon????
If I wanted to watch 3 lifeless corpses drag each other's dead bodies through the dirt, I should've searched this up; but no, youtube said, "here's something you might like".
It seemed like they was mad they liked the last one
It’s always ones that think they the shit 😂
Bruh- the only one that made the ramen right actually made it soupy and not dry -_-
Who the fuck drains their ramen?
who tf eats ramen without broth ⁉️
First of all why y’all eating ramen with a spoon 😭
Literally take asian dishes and ruined it ok
"it's like... salty" Yeah... that's ramen for you
Wtf these ppl thinking ramen is supposed to be dry??????
bruh as an asian who’s family makes ramen this hurts my soul LMAO
It’s ramen.... why are the first two so darn dry?? Like ramen is noodles and soup what do you mean “watery”? It’s soup....soup, broth, soup. Those were dry boiled noodles not ramen..... I’m sorry no. Plus it’s not real ramen if you don’t get a lil bit of the slurpy slurp. Like Ik some ramen is a bit dryer but it’s not DRY like it’s saucy. Not DRY
The way to eat ramen is to throw it in the trash.
The fact that they’re eating it with a spoon. A SPOON.
Ramen noodles are horrible for you. They should be labeled poison. There's other cheap things you can get.... At my grocery store everything I am about to list is at or under $2.  Salad mix Bag of carrots Pancake mix - a box should last you all week Oatmeal Rice Beans Eggs  I feel it's unnecessary to go on. You get the point.  Seriously. Read the nutrition info on those noodles. Then you need to times that by two. Cause nobody eats just half a pack of ramen noodles.
I swear do people really think ramen is supposed to be without the broth? People think ramen is pasta. There are a bunch of different types of ramen but cmon the basic image of “ramen” is a bowl of noodles that don’t need to be seasoned the broth is what needs the season. Use the combination of noodles and broth. People are dumb
please i’m a high-school freshman n mine the B E S T *here me out yall* 😏👏🏼 a pan barely filled with water BUT just ENOUGH — Hot boiled water, let garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, red chili peppers, Valentino Hot Sauce, lime, a tad bit butter, AND SUM OF THAT SPICY TACO SEASONING, — SIMMER in the pot of hot water, :) ADD YA NOODLES once those are half way cooked add sum that seasoning from the ramen packet 😩 mix that up, a tad bit more black peppers/red chili peppers , — TINY PINCH of salt, a *P I N C H* 🤌🏼 of sun that taco seasoning again 😩👏🏻 MIX MIX MIX — Noodles should absorb all that flavored juice leaving a TAD bit left) bring to a bowl AND ADD YOUR DICED JALAPEÑOS.
Why tf is this in my recommendations
These guy doesn't even know how to make ramen lol
OLUWAMAYOWA WAS SO COCKY I WAS EXPECTING SO MUCH MOREEEE
Chicken and shrimp? yall aint that broke
Just had to add broke to make everyone make fun of em
None of these people eat ramen and they definitely ain't broke
Brugh these kids are broke, at least they have something to eat so they do not have the right to complain because other people don’t even get to eat especially on the streets, and screw that cheetah girl with her dry as ramen
Ramen noodles are gross in general
lmao that girl really jus said “my moms spanish” 💀
RAMEN IS SUBMERGED IN BROTH ARE THEY STUPID
spanish is a language...
It’s always the hype one downing someone else stuff who’s stuff always suck lol
You couldn't find at least one white person??? 😠
Put som
Y’all idk if you can even call it ramen, the only closest one to ramen was the one in the cute ponytail 😗
Why do they use a spoon?
"Her ramen is watery" "This ramen is dry" "This ramen tried too hard" SO WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND???
let me put you on this: fideo inspired ramen  1 pack any ramen, you’re not using packet anyway. cook noodles and normal and drain broth to your desired liquid to noodle amount. (this is a soup so don’t low ball it)  then add to water w noodles:  -~1Tsp consomate  -dash of paprika and black pepper  -half a lime squeezed  -some cilantro if you’re into that  eat w some tortilla chips or soft boil an egg for a little something extra, should’ve let me on ✋😌
Nigerians normally eat ramen dry
2:23 Yea guys the rawmen men matters
I add shrimp to almost anything like rice and ramen 😭 i thought it was normal
So no one knows that Ramen is SOUP that is supposed to have broth and that’s what the seasoning packet goes in...? Hot water... Just me...? Oh... don’t get me wrong I love my Ramen dry but I would never complain that Ramen was watery because it’s supposed to be watery if anything?  😭
The cheetah print girl seems like a pick me girl.
BiG bRaIn StUfF
So is it too salty or is it flavorless because you tasted the Ramen and said it had too much seasoning then you turned around and said it didn’t have enough ? 🥴 hater ?
It’s the spoon
Its always the “Chef Ramsey” wannabe talking the most and always get the lowest rating 😂😂😂
Dafuc? leopar printed girl made me cringe with her attitude and look at her instagram nickname Hahahahha stay humble
A spoon to eat ramen..... seriously
All of their ramen looked dry
😭 aye buzzfeed kinda wilding with these titles- come on .. I’m getting more sus and sus about this white supremacy thing cause wtf 😭
Well fuck pass the bowl I’ll eat it since y’all are being so picky

Do folk really eat their ramen WITHOUT broth?
got second hand embarrassment for the cheetah print girl 🤨☝️
Screaming laughing at the Nigerian girl. Being so mean when hers was rubbish literally lmfaoo
“There is to much water” the whole food is based around Soup 🤣So what ya meaAn
The fact that it says broke
dude shrimp is expensive. deal with it
And those are the driest noodles I’ve seen 🤣🤣🤣🖐🏽
Yo I would eat marcus' ramen shooot
Olu: “I WOULD PReFEr mY RAMeN A LiTTle BiEt MoRE DRY” SIS YOUR RAMEN WAS A WHOLE ASS DESERT BESTIE. TRY AGAIN
'THE RAMEN IS A BIT WATERY' I CANNOT W YALL WDYM
I don’t like olu stfu wit yo dry ass noodles😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Wish they told them how many point they had to see there reactions
But Why Her Noodles Was Looking So Dry 😭😭😭😭They Look Like My First Batch Of Noodles When I Didn’t Really Know How To Make Them Hoes When I Was I Kidd & I Threw Them Away . Lol I’m Surprised She Got A 2 Lol
❤️🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
this cheetah girl is getting on my nerves
Why the hell they got a spoon for a noodle challenge ? The producers must’ve been broke too
Is it dry or watery dang
What’s been bothering me is why they are using spoons for ramen you do you but I would use a fork or something
Lol home girl made all Nigerians look bad 🤦🏾‍♂️
I’m not even a college student but my ramen is 10 times better than what ever the fuck they be making I’m Chinese and I’m just disappointed like gah dayum
I mean I’m not in college but why add extra stuff if you’re broke 🤡
Eating ramen with a spoon
Alright now do this again but with Asians.
If the noodles feel slimy, they are overcooked.
Olu ramen dry as Fu**
There is always a cheetah girl every video. Also I always thought ramen was made like a soup cuz that's how I've been doing it.
She left saying dif vibe dif taste
Mine comes with a different vibe apparently but it comes with a different vibe but if it is different it doesn’t mean it is good
the name of the video tho
0:44 did she really just say that..
why all the noodles so dry? 😂😂
i like how the ones who do the worst talk the most 😂😂😂
now why you got the eatin ramen wit spoons
“i would like my ramen a bit more dry” yea girl we can tell
Cheyenne literally was the only nice one...
Lmao this peeps don't know the definition of struggles and being broke 🤣😐
Cheetah girl - “This is just dry, its not cutting it for me.” Cheetah girl - “ I like my ramen dry.”  Me-  “ girl......what, she must be a Gemini”
The Nigerian girl needs to stop bro
The girl with braids is the only one who isn’t annoying
"i would prefer my ramen to be a little bit more dry"    yeah... we could tell
man i hate the one with the long ass name like stfu you arent special
cheetah print girl deserves to be broke bruh
How she broke if she able to buy Nigerian season and and ingredients? My mom is a proud chef who loves collecting herbs, spices and trying new ingredients so I know that shit ain't cheap.
its always the ones talking shit
Me eating noodles while watching them eat noodles😏
ramen is supposed to have soup in it, it's not pasta lmao..
Wait....I am suppose to drain the ramen? Mine is ALWAYS in a bit of liquid. Noodle soup.
I wish they show the losers reaction
You can tell the one with the curly hair was never broke
Did bitch just say it was salty like it’s not ramen? 🤨
why tf is she crying over salt
Cheetah girl: You guys need more flavor and it is watery so anyways I am the best then gets 2
A "broke college" friend of mine made a very good Ramen Bowl, and it's even healthy. The ingredients are noodles with alfredo sauce, steak seasoned with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder (cooked to medium), chicken seasoned with salt, black pepper, and paprika, shrimp with some seafood seasoning, and he just threw in some avocado slices and mixed them all up in a bowl. You can say it's a bit over the top considering it's made by a "broke college student". If you're gonna eat a broke meal, at least make it healthy and delicious, and that was his way of doing it.
Ramen usually has broth tf
Ramen is supposed to have liquid in it smh ?
it upsets me that they aint have hat sauce at all😭✋
Kinda knew miss cheetah print would embarrass herself even before it happened lmao
Can we talk about how pretty Cheyenne is? Like girl what?
Isn't ramen supposed to be watery?
It’s amazing when someone likes to boast and talk much and it back fires 😌
Yeah, when you try my Ramen it will be kneaded fresh from the flour with hardy bone broth applied with a good selection of meats from the bone. Y'all out here like ramen is f*cking Spaghetti or Mac & Cheese, this is what I would call noodle pasta or instant noodles, not true Ramen respectfully.  Ramen - Is pulled noodles usually served with a broth.
All that unnecessary attitude for what? 💀
That Nigerian girl really thought she was all that
This girl brought in some ramen chunks
this shit aint even ramen its just intsant noodles
All three dishes looked gross. That's barely even ramen anymore
Olu was talking the most crap I knew hers was Finna be the worst
I literally make my ramen with alot of water 😬
Moral of it all is that never under estimate the girl in the black and that the cheetah one had noodles drier than my cracked skin and that the boy’s one was way too simple.
It’s always the ones who say they have the best ones that suck
cheetah print girl needs to humble herself.
Get that cheetah print gurl outta here.... thats disgusting.... the other girl is so nice... props to her mom for teaching her well :)
All these ramens were shiijt
She said it was salty then said it didn’t have flavor, what?
The consistency of ramen noodles should be chewy but not too chewy, the noodles should be flavourful too. Ramen should have soup, not a single ramen restaurant has something called ramen without soup.In what fucking world ramen looks dead. All of their noodles pass any of the qualifications to be remotely CLOSE to what ramen actually is.
It’s called broth
I just put the flavor packet with hot sauce
lmaooo i’m crying omm
Why tf is they eating with a spoon😑
Which part of "broke" meals they don't understand?? Obviously she gotta save some of the shrimp
you can tell the 2 who were so critical have never tried or seen authentic ramen before. they were so quick to judge, but ended up enjoying it. that’s why you should humble yourself before thinking everything needs to look a certain way to fit your comfort zone
second hand embarrassment from the cheetah shirt girl
She said “ruman”
Why they using spoons
This is sad......
These college kids gunna get flamed on their ig for sayin their ramen is too watery dawg. Remove this video LOL
Why they eating with spoons
Is it just me or does the Nigerian girl think she’s better than everyone, i kinda hate her
That African girl she need to stopppp hers not even cooked she prob put it in the bowl and added some salt and called it a day baby girl that’s not it
Bruh, they all being picky. Am I the only one who just wants to eat food? Not caring about texture or salty whatever
I’m cracking up😂😂whole thing was hilarious
Did... Did they tell these kids to act THIS obnoxious?....
Bitch complaining about the soup
Nun of them can’t make ramen dawg I’m sorry😂😂
Please, Please, Pleasssee guys, DONT. USE. MARUCHAN. RAMAN. Use real Asian ramen from your Asian stores. Even the Asian instant ramen is good. Trust me its much better and more worth it.
Her: its too salty Also her: season the Ramen
a lot of people in these videos really need to be humbled fr
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven!✝️
see how the nicest people always win?
Haven't even watched the video and I already know cheetah print gurl gonna be a bitch.😤
The only one that looked good, to me, was the last one. IT HAD BROTH!!! THATS THE GOOD STUFF! AND SHE WENT FANCY WITH THE SHRIMP! ADDED SOME OYSTER AND SARACHA SAUCE!? HECK YEAH!!! THATS HOW I EAT MY FANCY RAMEN!!! I actually like my ramen with a loooot of broth!
The one in the cheetah print is acting like she’s a 5 star gourmet chef...ma’am you got CLUMPS in  yo ramen if u gonna cook it cook it well
If u can Afford shrimp why u even eating Ramen
There using a SPOON
all of them can’t cook lol

i just feel like it isnt hard to just add some salt pepper, paprika, sesame seed, with the packet, an egg and call it a day...
I ain’t like da cheetah gurr anyways 😂😂
All these contestants don't know that ramen is noodles with soup.
All of these look nasty as hell
Low-key hate those people that be talking shit through the whole video about other people foods but then they be coming out with some bogus ass creations
“it has no color” well it’s supposed to be edible 😭 if your broke why tf you worried ab the color
That Nigerian girl jus needs to stop like you don’t need to add anything else ur grandma taught u
I feel like none of them but the girl who won been thru a struggle 😂
I love siracha in my ramen, but she put far too much water in the serving bowl unless you like waterlogged noodles.
Called herself Nigerian.. I’m embarrazzeddd
😭😭they so shady
cheetah girl did all that and made that nasty ass ramen 😂
It’s Mexican ok not Spanish
The Nigerian girl wanted to win so bad she gave the others bad scores..
I would have won
Come through university of Bridgeport  !!! Put on for CT ✊🏾✊🏾
Has no one noticed they eating noodles with spoons
Child why are all of them so dry where the water at.
Where did they get these people?? Everyone I know eats ramen the same wtf
jesus fucking christ... as a Pacific Islander/American WHO THE FUCK TAUGHT THEM TO MAKE RAMEN.... AT LEAST GET BROTH PLS
Am I the only dumbass that thought ramen was supposed to be eaten with broth
Please on behalf of my fellow Japanese people I BEG of you not to call dry ass noodles “RAMEN” because RAMEN is supposed to have soup 😭
“I don’t like my ramen with water.. it’s really watery”   BOI RAMEN IS A FRICKIN NOODLE SOUP BASICALLY- 🥲
It’s always the ones who talk the most shit that end up getting the lowest scores 💀
first of all she talking abt adding color who gives af I’m eating it not wearing it 🤦🏽‍♂️smh !
"theres water in there" miss girl, Its a noodle soup, the girl who put shrimp and broth in there has flavor, the other people ramen is dry..
Why is there always one annoying person that so self centered in these videos that lose
Y’all come for the Nigerian girl but that’s just how she is she not meaning it intentionally stop coming for people you don’t none about talk about yourself some people just talk like that in general like leave her alone most Nigerians come off det way they just have to much pride most y’all can relate because I’ve seen people who ain’t Nigerian act that way like other  home girl said “if you don’t got non nice to say don’t say it at all”
Since when is shrimp for broke college kids? And what is so wrong with a boiled egg and some canned corn. That is my struggle ramen, cheap and filling.
when my friend showed me how he made ramen, i was like "Bruh!? You're adding the seasoning to it after you drain all the water? WTF you doing?"
Olu had serious bitch attitude I’m glad she lost. I fw Cheyenne tho, she gives off good energy and I’m glad she won ;)
“I like mine a little more dry” Hers: crunch*
Have people never tried ramen with soup? I'm so confused the cooking instructions is literally on the package.
See a common occurrence in these vids is there is always that one annoying person who thinks they are the best and they get the worst rating
how do u mess up ramen like clumps come on
I think if Cheetah Print Girl's parents can afford to even begin to pay tuition for Neuroscience, then only mention 'we pay for parking and books"... HMMMM....
Bruh, idk know why I’m so aggravated...like, do they  tell them to be so rude...? Idk, I hate when ppl talk shit abt food, it’s weird lmao
0:08  Shindeiru      NANI?!?!
They clearly wasn’t that broke if they were able to add meats and other seasonings
i dont really like alot of water in any of my ramen but this is ridiculous lol
Idk if they know but ramen has broth 😀ramen is not dry
Olu i’m embarrassed for you
Ms girl was so cocky about it and ended getting a 2 LMAO
Ramen WITHOUT Water Is Not Okay...
Hey guys I just wanted to say that Jesus loves you he died on the cross and rose three days later so that you can be saved. Therefore it is by faith not our works that we can be saved. He wants a relationship with you. Don’t give up, keep going. In this world there is sorrow but in him there is peace and no condemnation or shame, so although we have sinned, because he died for us so that we don’t have to bear the punishment if we put our faith in him we can be made new. Faith doesn’t just mean believe but belief in all the things of Jesus/ God and the truth of the things about him. Turn to him while you can, he’s reaching out to you.💖
As a Nigerian person, I don’t claim the Nigerian cheetah print girl, and no thats not how all of us cook, her sh!t just DRYY-
it's not watery it is SOUP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought shricha was a normal thing in ramen nowadays
Why are they eating ramen with a SPOON
...........ramen with no broth. hmmmmm thats call stir fry noodles.....
Now y in the gen z would this be the caption
why are the other two complaining about the broth??? that's literally what makes it ramen. it's technically a soup. if you wouldn't drain a can of chicken soup why would you drain the broth of ramen??
Cheetah print girl was getting on my last nerves lol
I’m not surprised there wasn’t a asian college student in this video or else this wouldn’t be a competition.
“They were wrong by cooking period”😭
It’s always the most confident person having the worse dish
lol. They don't like their ramen "watery"...it's soup! It's supposed to be watery! I will eat it saucy, but I prefer soupy ramen 100%.
am I the only person who don't put shit on my raman and still enjoy it. sum time I be putting spinach seasoning just to make me feel good about my self 😹
I like putting whisked eggs and some vegetables in mine
I want to see her reaction of everyone hating hers 😭

No.
“I prefer my ramen a little more dry.” YEA MISS GIRL WE KNOW
in every one of these x tries x food videos the person who gives the worst ratings makes the worst food.
Shawty really said I like dry ramen
Why are they all so mean, my cousins can’t cook shit, and I still eat their food, I was raised to never judge anyone’s cooking and eat it no matter what, why are they all so picky
Olu be rude asf like stfu chile
“It has water in it”  It’s RAMEN NOODLE FUCKING SOUP!
What the heck ! Isn’t ramen suppose to be wet or have juice ? I can not eat it dry
imagine not liking the "water" in SOUP
The Nigerian girl said it was salty and then she said that it had no seasoning?! Make up your mind or just be quiet! Or be like the other girl and say nothing if you have nothing nice to say.
Im pretty sure traditional ramen has broth 🤦‍♂️  Dont be like these "people", eat your ramen with broth.
Real question: why tf they eating noodles with spoons?!
My favorite line from the guy was   "Yo, what do you mean where did they go wrong?  They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it. They were wrong by cooking, period."
people  really out  here with dry ramen
Wait so y’all so slow to the point that you don’t understand that real ramen has broth? This really disgraceful
cheetah print girl getting on my nerves....WHY DO IT NEED COLOR????
the cheetah print girl was WAY too confident 💀

Who here’s a texture person ✋🏾 👇🏾
bruh why tf would ramen be dry??
I- did miss cheetah print girl just ask why the ramen is salty 💀
Spanish mom vibes 🤦🏻‍♂️ stfu. No Spanish mom would literal make sand to eat.
I guarantee my shot would taste and look better
Hey cheetah print... stay humble next time so you don’t give the rest of us second hand embarrassment 😂🤣😂🤣
She was so confident and only got 2 points 😂
Do they not know that Ramen typically has a broth...

Cheetah print is the definition of "all talk"
The girl with the Afro is annoying as fuck.

It’s ramen who doesn’t leave a little broth 🙄
Yoo the girl with the Afro is going to the college where I live
Marcus and Cheyenne Valid
Why would you give them a spoon 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
The meanest one is usually the worst lol 😂
Wtf is on the top of her head
Lmao she thinks she’s so black but let every Nigerian down
Wait till the first 2 people find out that Raman is a soup. Why is their so dry
The cheeta print girl would just say how it’s worse then hers and say how hers is better and then it looked (and apparently tasted) like dog shit
ramen is literally supposed to be in a soup... like yes there are dry versions but like ????
"they went wrong by cooking" 😭😭😭😭
This ain't ramen, it's just boiled flour in a bowl filled with seasoning. Give me this shit and i'll walk out of the building trying to find the brain you forgot to pick up when you dropped it.
Why they eating noodles with a spoon?😭😭
Wtf did I just watch lmao it’s fuckin ramen relax and you three did not impress 🤣
Noodles not suppose to have to much broth in it y’all noodle probably be nasty 🤮 😂 your suppose to drain at least 85% of the water
bro if u just make simple ass bank you'd prob just make gormount ramen out of a kettle and there are literally cheap as shit in cheap ass stores.
My husband makes the best noodles  Shrimp noodles  *Bacon  *Cut up Hot links  *Hot sauce  *Black pepper   Drain the water out   Fire 🔥
Sis with the fro critiquing so much but her shit was clumpy asl 🤣

“What is all this water?”  Y’all don’t know what BROTH is? 🤦🏽‍♀️
Speaking of. Let my broke ass go make some ramen.

Everyone’s ramen looked nasty 😂

who eats ramen with a spoon tho?
"It's salty". duh. it's ramen
arent original noodles supposed to be with water and a taste its just a broth that gives flavour and btw cheetah girl had less colour
Them after this vid: Cheyenne shut up girl I won ur ramen was dry and wack, Olu: bit*h shut up mine was so much better than urs, Marcus: chill out, the girls: shut up bit*h.😂 all jokes
Bruh the girl in the cheetah outfit is such a show off😑
Ok but why is no one talking about the fact that they’re eating ramen with spoons?!

How TF do you mess Ramen up? 🤦‍♂️
Cheetah print talmbout crayfish🤦🏾‍♂️😂
So we all came to the comments for that one chick..
But seriously, why are they eating dry ramen? I'm so confused
If only gordan ramsey was the judge
I don’t understand how everyone’s ramen is so damn dry? Where’s the broth? I make mine with chicken broth.
Also, why are they complaining about the "water?" It's the B R O T H
Ramen is meant to be "watery" it's a soup!!!
It's always the ones that talk a lot of big game that end up looking like fools...
The puffy hair girl is so confident and not broke how u put in so many things
“Water” uhhhh- you mean “BROTH?!?!?!”  And the whole thing with shrimp!!!!  Who can afford protein in their ramen?! I can’t!!!!  My recipe- boil the noodles, drain the water, add seasoning and butter, mix that together and whatever shredded cheese you want (I usually add Mexican blend) and serve! It’s DELICIOUS!!!
lmao why they gotta be broke tho
Did some of these students forget that ramen always has “water” it’s broth my dude-
Cheetah girl: the ramen has no colour. . .       Its fucking ramen. . .
cheetah print girl dipped her ramen in the water for like 10 seconds, threw a bunch of random seasoning in and then called it a day.
Also why did you give these people a spoon?
The only one that looks like ramen and this guy insults it...nasty? You think noodles that actually separate and some broth is nasty? Ugh.
Im good on nugerian food. And who tf eats Ramen wit a FORK.
honestly all there ramen looks nasty asf.
Ramen with a spoon???
Why they eating it with a spoon
Bruh , the broth is what makes ramen ramen . Taking it out obviously it would be dry
Idk why they was so broke I did work study & a retail job and I made it work
All they shit look nasty honestly 😂🤢🤢🤢
spoons? should've been forks
Why y’all gave them a spoon
Where’s the broth? It’s not Ramen without broth 💀
“It tastes...pretty...good” it HURT sis to compliment someone else’s dish like miss gorl you got a 2 combined
Who the fuck eats ramen with a SPOON 😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 it's the spoons for me
I feel like how you eat your ramen says a lot about you as a person
“Idk I like my ramen dry” Yea sis we saw that
PLSSSS THE BOY IS SO FUNNY
why the hell y’all give them spoons? 💀😭
LMAOAMOANOAOAOAOA 4:00 "no no non no " the way he slid it with his fingers too

the nigerian girl so irritating it ain’t even funny
Yoooo we need a part 2 where everybody cooks their maruchan with broth 🤣😭 This was just an abomination
“Look! It’s a clump!” 😭😭😭 bye

They talkin about how the "water" is bad bruh it's broth and it's meant to be there that's how you make it.
WHERES THE BROTH???🚊🚶🏻
AHH HE STARTED WIT THIS SHIT LOOK DRY ASL🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please this is not how Nigerians cook noodles lol lemme come and show yall how Nigerians really do it 😂😂
kinda disappointed that they used 3 black students for the "broke college student" ramen...
They’re as dumb as fuck where’s the broth
A spoon?
When she said it’s salty 🤣 DOGGGG, YOU EVER HAD RAMEN BEFORE???
Violated them in the title
that THUMBNAIL 😭
This has to be a joke... y’all really eat ramen with no juice at all???
Anyone else make their ramen spicy?:3
Where do they find these ignorant people...
Like 2 mins in an I’m not feeling cheetah print girl at alllll
These were not ramen, where was the soup? The vegetables cut up in the broth combined with the noodles is what makes the dish. And it doesn’t take much effort to do either.
I clicked on this bc it looked entertaining. My boyfriends name was Marcus and my name is Cheyenne. We broke up today and then I see both of our names in this video.......💔
Well the first mistake was when they used a spoon n not a fork 🤦🏽‍♂️
I know everybody talkin about the Nigerian girl in a comments..but why are they eating ramen with a SPOON?!?!!?!?!
Why is nobody talking about how they eating it with a fucking spoon
Ok I needa taste then myself cuz I do not trust their taste buds
Yo i make the best Ramen outta all yall no 🧢
THE CHEETAH PRINT GURL was talking about the guys ramen but look at her that embarrassing😭
You know, for someone tasting what broke college kids eats complains like its supposed to be some gourmet meal 💀
wait! you americans' ramen has no soup??? what the hell.....
ITS TO WATERY RAMEN IS SOUP IT JUTS WAS NOODLES
The girl with the Afro, she’s really complaining about color, it’s not ab color it’s ab if it’s good or not😭
I SWEAR RAMEN NEEDS WATER IT WHAT GIVES IT THE FLAVOR ..
Imagine liking this comment
Yeah Cheetah girl said it was salty and yet said the “noodles weren’t seasoned”. Yeah she gave me true hater vibes.
it’s ramen. there’s broth. what.
As a broke 14yo who makes ramen for a living, these guys are supposed to be the professional ramen makers? nah
this was mad easy to ace 😭 boil some noodles in some water, sauces, seasoning. sauté some onions. crack an egg in there. melt some cheese. boom.
Girl in cheetah print gotta go she giving off karen vibes.
She looks like the fortnite skin
I- why were they complaining about there being broth in the last bit like 😭😭😭 ramen is supposed to be eaten with brothhhhh
if u a broke college student where u getting all these bugie seasonings from? and shrimp? i couldnt afford shrimp as a college student
Why are they using spoons..
Who tf eats ramen with a spoon
Of course the it’s black people who are broke
I don’t even like ramen but if there isn’t water/broth in there I ain’t touching that dry ish! Like that’s literally how ramen supposed to be.
did they really give them spoons to eat ramen..I-
“They went wrong by cooking period “😭😭😭 PLSSS they she acted like her was the best oh no
marcus using gender neutral pronouns made me so happy pls <33
"The ramen is a bit watery"
Why da hail they ALL black.
Ramen is suppose to have water. yes you can eat it dry but ramen is a type of noodle soup in a way.
Why they got them eating ramen with a spoon?
I feel like I would win against these 3 tbh
I can’t be the only one like where is the liquid
"I prefer my ramen a little dry"  BITCH A LITTLE?!?! 💀💀💀
I find it hilarious that the one person who brags about “how good their food is” gets the worst score
And here’s a veryyyy good example that Nigerians can’t cook at allllll😭😭
How do you talk the most smack and get the lowest score? BYEE
moral of the story, they don't know what ramen is
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon 😀
Dont know why I thought that was d’angelo Wallace
Add cheese and butter. I swear it has changed everyone's life that ive introduced it to. You make a whole new dish
The Nigerian Girl was like "Season the ramen" Gurl cook the Ramen
cheetah print girl embarrassed herself
Ramen is soup. It’s literally the Japanese word for soup (not really though). This series of clumpy non-soup mistakes makes me very sad. Legit ramen with some chashu and egg and spring onion is a revelation that these guys obviously missed.
It's always the trash talkin ones who food seem to be trash.
SH¡TTTT 666K VIEWS THE DEVIL IS WATCHING
cheetah girl dtm.
i would’ve killed this put me on the show !😹 nobody made perfect with the soup at the bottom
Hahahaha What? "This has water, hell no...". It's a noodle soup, guys. Soup is wet.
😂😂😂😂""some"" nigerian people will literally convince you that salt 🧂🧂🧂🧂🧂TASTES like sugar ....just to boost their egos...look at her reactions 🤭🤭🤡
It’s BROTHHHHHHH THERES SUPPOSED TO BE BROTH IN RAMENNN💀not dry and clumpy freakin weirdos
Come on it's just Ramen. Some of these contestants acted like they were in Hell's Kitchen.
I love it when the person who swears they are the best gets the worst score
None of you know how to make ramen smfh
y’all are wylin💀💀this whole video confused me
I can't tell if olu was trolling the whole time or not. Her ramens not even cooked lmao.
I'd be like put Indomie goreng there and throw an egg and I prolly won over those three lol   MSG Baby!
Okay guys, so once I prepared ramen for someone and accidentally poured out the water afterward (because that’s how I eat it) and they were like “Where’s the water?” I felt sooooo bad. 😫😫😫
Who eats ramen noodles with a spoon😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Ramen is the most easiest thing to make!!!! Dear I cannot imagine how worse their other meals would taste!!! 🤢🤮😷
Are they slow? Cause it’s ramen soup not just noodles, the fact that they’re were so caught off guard by the fact there was broth is really throwing me off 💀
no one is going to talk about how they didnt give them forks to eat with lmao
Y’all I can’t just let my ramen sit there.
Cheetah print girl: I prefer my ramen dry..  Me: GIRL. I CAN TELL ... lol
The Nigerian girl is so prideful 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Cheetah print un embarrassed herself...
Where's the soup in all of these 😭😭😭 there's no flavorrr
i dont think the Nigerian girl gets that its supposed to be a struggle meal
the lack of broth is ✨disgusting✨
Wait people eat ramen with a spoon?
How she gon say it’s salty then say it needs seasoning like what?
damn, just looking at the ramen, I know I could make better ramen myself. In fact. I have made ramen that I can tell is way better just by the descriptions they gave. Also. WTF DO THEY MEAN WATER??? IT'S CALLED BROTH. HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN RAMEN OUTSIDE OF YOUR OWN DORM?!?!??
A spoon
I'm really picky to a point of annoying people, but what the heck is with these sudents? Why are they surprised that the ramen has water in it? It's literally written on the package to add water lol
it’s ALWAYS the ones that talk the most sh*t that end up getting the worst rating 🤣🤣🤣
Typical lightskin nigga
I don't like the nigerian girl no hate
The girl it’s the cheetah print made me mad😭
Very very very very very
Who eats ramen 🍜 with a spoon
The nigerian girl was so cocky and she got 2😂
Cheetah print girl was confident till she realized her ramen wasn't even cooked too funny
These people don’t even know what Ramen is ffs
The cheetah print girl gives me “Wendy’s girl” vibes if ykyk.. just look it up if you don’t
5:39 “i prefer my ramen dry”  LMAO WE KNOW SIS 💀💀
You should do, "asian people try each others ramen." A lot of college kids eat instant ramen so I do get where they are coming from.. Except, It's biased because they never had that REAL authentic asian flavors in real ramen.
It’s always the ones that talk the most shit that lose 😭
Am I the only 1 confused on how u fuck up ramen
that girl is annoying as FUCK
Why they ain’t jus get broke Asian kids to cook this Asian ramen 😭
Cheetah print girl is super annoying
Not the Nigerian girl saying “ITs To saLty” GURL RAMEN IS ALL SODIUM dummy
I think they all was just tryna be petty. Except for the winner
Not to be rude but none of them know how to make ramen 😭
The first two dont know how to cook ramen LMAO
So nobody was going to add bok choy or green onions or egg? No garlic? No miso? Okay. Breaking the ramen and putting the seasoning packet on it would’ve been better than that 💀
5:35   bru shes dumb
Olu was annoying. She has everything negative to say about everyone else’s ramen when in reality hers was dry ash and it didn’t look appetizing at all
theres supposed to be broth. This is why asian ramen is way better than this cheap fuk Edit: all she cares about is her seasoning Atagoogoo and crayfish or whatever she said
Only time I eat dry Ramen is when I just don't want to make the broth, but how I usually make is the broths first then add it to the noodles. Or when I don't have time just throw in and boil.
Yo they all dumb asf ramen supposed to have water.
I’m in college, don’t have money just like everyone else but there’s a thousand other things to eat than ramen. Being lazy and being poor are two different thing
...I think they were all too judgmental and harsh...
Why the people that talk the most about their food is the people that always end up last 😭😭😭
BROKE college kids 😂💀
nigerian girl fronting heavy so she can win, how’s she saying it’s too salty then saying season the ramen. um... girl, make up your mind
Nah is not ramen is instant noodles
If y’all don’t take normal noodles and add some damn hot sauce and shut ya mouth
Who the hell eats dry ramen?
Why arre they all blxck
Does everyone eat their ramen with a spoon? Or am I just trippin
People need to learn what ramen is
I’m lovin in the title they said broke college kids
I know I shouldn’t be talking about ramen because I usually just crunch it up in the bag open it up sprinkle in the spice and chow down 🥰🥰 like... it’s literally RAWmen noodles 💀💀💀
Kinda messed up that they all black
ramen is supposed to have some type of liquid in it who wants to eat dry ramen wtf
I would prefer my ramen a *little* dry           Guys what does *LITTLE* exactly mean?
the one who was the most cocky lost haha sucks for her
they were wrong by waking up and deciding to make this 🤣🤣🤣
They all look trash
@WHO.IS.MARCUS
The one in cheetah outfit is doing too much with her dry ass clump brick noodles 😂
Literally every single last one of these there are 2 chill people and then 1 extra cocky person who always has the most ass food. I mean there is no getting away from that the ramen wasnt even cooked tf.
First of all Ramen is supposed to have broth. They all fail lol
tbh everyone's ramen looked pretty bland 💀 and the watery comment took me out, it's broth.
I can tell no one reads the back of the package, it clearly says you don't drain the ramen. Because it is a soup. That's not water, that's stock. You can make them with half of water and then it comes out cooked but without that much wAtEr.
Isn’t ramen a noodle stew kinda- it’s supports to be watery-
Not broke college kids 🤣
The cheetah print girl is snooty af. I knew hers wasn't gonna win
“iTs a BiT wAtErY” its soup... it’s supposed to have a broth y’all know that right?
If you don’t eat your ramen with the broth, you’ve been doing it all wrong.
"I don't like the water" y'all know ramen supposed to be a soup right?
I can’t with the title explicitly stating that they’re broke
What’s something that doesn’t say racist but feels racist: Broke college kids and they all black...
I lIke My rAmen dRy   Yeah we know😭😂💀
Ppl really angry at the cheetah girl? She's just confident and definitely a Leo. Just let her live
The ones with the most to say always have the worst dish 😂😂
cheetah girl: it’s got some water which is okay but i prefer my ramen a bit more dry.  YO RAMEN IS LITERALLY CLUMPED TOGETHER YOU DIDNT EVEN BOIL THAT SHIT YOU JUST TOOK IT OUT DA PACK AND SAID BONEAPPLETEETH 🤣🤣
why “broke college kids” tho
How can you say it's good  But then give it a 3
Does anyone else use the seasoning as the broth for the noodles?
have those two never had a bowl of soup noodle before lmfaoo wtf
"I prefer my ramen a little more dry" Well that's a little too obvious
I wanted to see the reaction of the chick who was SO sure of herself getting the lowest score, by far.
Ewww I hate dry ramen
U.S. students having that broke struggle paying for parking.  Rest of the world: y'all can afford cars?
Let's be real they don't know how to cook 🍜
“I like my ramen a bit more dry” YEAH WE CAN TELL🤣🤣
Food for thought...they both hated Olu's ramen & she hated both of theirs...true moral of the story... everybody's taste buds are different based on what they grow up on, where they learned their cooking skills and what they are used to.... compare this to the "fufu" trend, if you will.... diversity is everywhere
the cheetah print girl watching this and reading the comments: 🥲
Ppl be talking bout the arrogant one but like the guy was just mean and judgemental and yall are broke, what u expect? Shrimp buffet?
The Nigerian girl bored me tbh
5:38 SOOO DRY HMMM
2:05 CRINGE
“not enough shrimp” ARENT YALL SUPPOSED TO BE BROKE? HOW CAN YOU AFFORD SHRIMP
So...... is it only the Mexicans that eat ramen with broth? Cause where’s the broth at?
Haitian  try each other's gri`o and picliz
im-   ok helo i am chinese ahaa... just one thing i have wanted to say about this             WHY IS THERE NO BROTH. *WHY IS THERE NO FUCKING BROTH*
if y’all don’t like “watery” ramen, get FRIED NOODLES! Like indo mie/pancit canton.. because ramen is supposed to have broth lol
Nigerian girl Ramen looked raw asf😂 then had the never to say the other one had no colour
olu is annoying
I knew cheeta print girls was gonna suck the second she pronounced it “rAyMaN”
Eating noodles meant for soup but complaining about it being watery Lmaooo
Ok ummmm first of all.... who tf eats it with a spoon?
why is the ramen so dry? Where did all the broth go?
the ramen chunk is killing me here 3:17
>When they're all black
best way to eat ramen : add lemon and hot sauce . maybe add alil salt or alil more seasoning than whats in the packet
The guy gives me life 😭
“I would prefer my ramen a bit dry.”  Bitch we know!

That’s the life right there , going through college broke eating noodles just to leave college in debt eating..... noodles yikes
Bruh what, ramen is supposed to be dry??? Since whennnnn sheesh say that to the local asians in your complex theyll be sure to knock you out
Girl 3 was the only one who actually made ramen. The other two act like they've never been to an actual ramen shop. They didn't even know ramen was a soup ??
why did they give them spoons for ramen
Kids in Africa would’ve ate it
I’m very confused as to why they gave these beautiful children of God a SPOON to eat RAMEN noodles?? 😭😭
Im not a college student but I am considered broke I like a sprinkle of sugar and some  grated cheddar  cheese mix bout it (may not be really healthy but don't knock it until you try it)
There's always one person who is too eager in their hate and then they fail lol
this reminds me of the time i went to my friends house and they were like “let’s make ramen!” and as a japanese kid i was ready for the soup and shit but they just boiled it strained it and put salt on it🌞
Cheetah spot girl- "I would prefer my ramen a little more dry"  Everyone- did you mean A LOT more dry

Ramen is meant to have water!

You guys should try the maruchan chicken flavor with a little bit of the lime and valentine which Is a hot sauce
Cheetah print girl: " I would prefer my ramen a bit more dry..."  Lol we know
Producer: where did cheers shirt girl go wrong  They guy: she went wrong by waking up and deciding to make ramen I’m dead💀😂 geez this comment blew up real fast😂
ITS FUCKING RAMEN NOT OLIVE GARDEN
Who is eating their ramen without the liquid?! Ramen is a soup! The seasoning packet is to make the water into broth 😂
Kinda racist how the video is titled "broke" and the only people in the video are black people
The black girl with the braids was the only ramen that looks like soup lol 😆 regardless of shrimp and extra

How is ramen dry? U literally put it in water and boil it she sounds mad slow
None of them know how to make Ramen
Why ain’t nobody talking about them eating it with a spoon?
I haven’t finished watching and I already know who’s going to loose.
“i don’t like the water”  do you not know that, that water is called broth it’s where all the flavor is
istg the cheetah print chick is going to be the death of me “omg are you trying to kill me with this?” and “my ramens the best” and “SEASON THE RAMEN” but yet “ugh this is too salty” like bruhhhhhhhhhhh please stfu
It's never fails watching this......right The most judgemental ones be having the worst taste buds😂😂😂

“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry” Oh we DEFINITELY know sis!! 💀
I think...poor students mean something diffrent in America....we just eat the ramen noodles
If its salty then why does he have to season the ramen
"MiNe aCCtuALy hAS flAVour" shut the fuck up
girl with the afro thought her dish was IT, but everyone said it was just sitting crumbles
Afro girl turned into Gordon Ramsay real quick then brought Frozen food
Can’t believe no one put in eggs. Eggs are the best in ramen

“i’m not tryna be mean” ... “are you tryna kill me”
Ramen is meant to have water in it 😭 its a noodle soup eYe

DID YALL FORGET RAMEN IS A SOUP??? “it’s watery”SIS ITS SUPPOSED TO BE QKSNDKQNSKAN W YALL DRY ASS RAMEN
So the second girl the one with the afro said his ramen is too salty then she was like the only thing that has flavor is the chicken and I'm not being racist cause I'm black too. But it's obvious she just wanted hers to win. Can someone explain what she meant....
they eat ramen without soup/broth w h a t-
the pickiest girl and the one that be saying theirs is gonna win from the start is always loosing 😭😭
Do they... do they mean broth?
“There’s water in here” Uh yeah, ramen is a noodle soup, that’s like the whole point
Who cant make noodles taste good like wth. i feel bad for them.
Glad they actually made a video based on comments from a previous video. Loved it!
The Nigerian girl embarrassed herself so much I feel bad for her
“Rahmin”
Ramen is too watery? It's literally a meant to be served with broth....
.......who makes it like that
What a joke lol.
I think people prob didn't like Olu,s ramen, cause they don't know the spices like that
Broke collage kids🤣🤣🤣
TEH ONLY EXPECTABLE WAY is 2 cups of water in a pot boiling, noodle in for 4 minutes, AND YOU MUST ADD THE FLAVOR WHILE COOKING.
Cheetah girl 😂💀💀
For being broke y’all are definitely picky.
I'm sorry but how do you get those "Nigerian" ingredients if you're a broke college student  Its just weird to me
they need a damn asian kid there to show off real ramen
They did cheetah print girl dirty lmao
Olumowyyayayayay
Olu made me mad she had the worst ramen out of them all and had the audacity to talk like they was literally dry
I like my noodles steaming hot, and if you keep the water they stay hot longer
How do you fuck up ramen lls
t o x i c.
“i don’t like the water” like   it’s called broth, you uncultured swine pfffft
It's always the one who talk the most 🙄
Cheetah print girl: The noodles are way too salty” Also the cheetah print girl: “The only thing that’s seasoned is the chicken” girl bye
they ain’t even pronouncing ramen right , all of it prolly tasted like dookie 😤
That african girl was too confident
“Ew it has water” BITCH ITS SOUP. WHY DOES EVERYONE SUDDENLY WANNA ACT LIKE THEYRE CHEF RAMSEY
If I made maggi it'd be gameover
U need an Asian on there. Bag of ramen and condiments make it 🔥 like egg
cheetah print girl is so bitcy
LMFAOO for the first round cheetah girl said “season the ramen” but she just said it’s salty like what..
Her name is art.
Where is the broth????

Why tf are they eating ramen with a fuvking spoon?
And I really thought I was gonna like cheetah girl..
The cheetah print bitch is annoying af
Girl do you want COLOR or FLAVOR???

I’m confused why it said that broke college kids and it’s all blacks people? Confused
Girl with cheetah print: Its way too salty also cheetah print girl: it has no flavor :!
She’s proud and rude af too for a Yoruba girl.  One with bad noodles too.
why does this girl have such a bad attitude and think she’s gordon ramsey?!?
Please don’t say that’s ‘Nigerian’ style noodles.   That’s YOUR noodles.
She said “I’d prefer my ramen dry” MISS GURL WE KNOW. WE SAW ‘EM CLUMPS
Ramen Vs. Ramen Noodle Crunch 😂🤣
First off, ramen is good when it is in a soup-like broth. That is how it is normally eaten as well. The cheetah print girl needs to get outta here lmao...
Cheyenne was the best idk what tf the other two be eating 😂😂
It’s so salty 😐 I’m out guys
that guy and cheeta print girl's ramen don even look like ramen :/
Let’s get one thing straight, this is not ramen 🍜 this is noodles😂😂
Why the fuck are they eating it with a spoon
why is everyone so rude to each other LMAOOOO
Y’all ramen is freaking soup these people dumb   I want it more dry 🤡🤡🤡🤡  Yea looking at y’all ramens we can tell
I feelime the cheetah girl took a packet of ramen and threw away the instructions and made her own thing, its something but it's not ramen. The only one who was ramen was Cheyenne who had water in it. Idk how y'all eat ramen without water like it's soup 😭
remen😜
Africans be thinking they better den black people bruh
I don’t mean to be rude but the olu woman has an inflated ego.. and I think someone should burst her bubble cause ma’am
this cheetah girl be judging the ramen about water bruh ramen means soup and noodles
People eat ramen dry 😟
She ain even pronounce it right bruh it’s pronounced rah-men
Mines... chicken flavor with a slice of cheese. Straight mangle action
"Its watery" "There's water in this" You dumb b¡tches clearly know nothing about soup since that 'water' is broth.
we need asian for this show ofc
why are they all black?
All them can’t cook
Olu is so pretty 😻
Like my guy ur all broke stop hating eachothers food
Do they not put liquid in the ramen? The soup the bomb
They ate it with a spoon...
I cannot believe these people are eating these noodles dry. Home girl with seafood ramen was the only one that sounded and looked appealing.
Ramen is a litlle bit more dry........what??
why is it always the overconfident ones who score the lowest lmaooo
The girl with the Shiro should’ve been instantly disqualified we all know a bag of shrimp that’s not on sale is expensive asf
this hurt me.
The one who thought she was the best lost and the one who was kinda nice won
My cheap ramen:   Small bit of water to stop the noodles from sticking (like a table spoon of the water I used 3/4th the chicken flavor packet Sliced up hotdog Some kind of veggie
what the fuck is happening in the us for kids to say ramen is too watery
Wtf the broth is the best part
I would’ve bodied this smh
Are they even black ? Wheres the cheetos and cut up jerky stick?
Ngl this made me mad, u eating ramen with a spoon, HUUUUHHHHHHHHH
Oh cheetah print don’t worry we know you like yours DRYYY
The cheeta print girl reminds me of those overly confident delusional contestants at hells kitchen who made the worst food, were roasted by gordon ramsey and were out of the show by the end of the first night
All those ramens looks disgusting....like where’s the water
I mastered the art of ramen noodle making, years of struggle meals have brought me to where i am today
I'm Nigerian but I'm glad the girl with the cheetah print lost! What type of attitude is that? There's this thing that we call being ✨overconfident✨😂😂😂 Lol she was dissing everyone's ramen but her own came out like bricks?🤷🏾‍♀️😂😂
Wait no it can’t be EWW ARE THEY EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON?!?!!?!?
How is this broke ramen? When I was in school I get the chicken ramen in a cup take season from the dorm kitchen usually pepper, garlic and FRANKS RED HOT boil hot water let it sit for like 5mins I like soft noodles then drink the juice 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
RAMEN IS A SOUP, DAFUQ are they talking about, "its too watery"
Im Nigerian but that ramen look....... 😬
Not y’all givin em spoons to scoop
If they don’t like the broth, I don’t know what’s wrong with these people
The only one that didn’t look dry is the girls one that had water in it the rest of them like dry Ramen I don’t eat shrimp or oyster sauce all I eat is Salmon and trout and stuff but the girls with the water looked really good
I think that the title should be changed to just college kids try each other ramen not “broke college kids”🤦🏽‍♀️
It's funny how usually the one's who think they plate is the best are the worst.
Not y’all callen em broke
1:03 yes just gotta add Valentina and lemon and bababooi one of the best home style ramen.
They gave y’all spoons to taste test💀💀💀
why are they all black???
These people privileged af
So like...no one is gonna talk about them eating the ramen with spoons instead of forks or...
That’s some racist school only allow black kids or something lol
how are u gonna say “there’s water” LIKE NO DUH, ITS RAMEN, IF ITS WITHOUT WATER, ITS FUCKING STIR FRY-
Its always the nicest people who win and I'm glad
No one: That girl: this has way too much seasoning like way to much salt  That girl same girl 10 seconds later: wears the seasoning
But why the ramen so dry tho???  It’s a frocking soup dude
I think the last 1s are bomb. You put your seasoning and everything else in the microwave for just a minute and remove before they loose their texture 😋🤤😩💯
Ramen is so posed to have water or broth... 😐
Real world definitely will be sitting the cheetah shirt girl.. DOWN! Humble pie for her..
Cheetah girl: “The color of the noodles looks grey, there’s too much water, the noodles arent in pristine condition, the bowl you served this to me in wasnt ancient roman marble, and you didnt pay for my college tuition but the shrimps saved the day :)”  GIRL YOU ARE LITERALLY IN A VIDEO NAMED BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS EAT EACH OTHERS RAMEN WHY ARE YOU EXPECTING A SPECIFICALLY HAND CRAFTED MEAL👁👄👁🤦🏽‍♀️
I don’t like the way leopard print girl said ramen
how are these people broke bruh
None of them know how to do it
“It’s too salty” yeah ramen has like 2000mg of sodium a packet 😂
Bruh the third girl is sooo fucking annoying
who eats noddles with a spoon
they using spoons..
I like eating my ramen with a fork to pick up the noodles better. Then I drink the broth.
ik I'm not the only one who heard  "Omae Wa Mou" at first
Let me know your guys' recipe. Mine is a broke Pho ramen.   Broth Consists of:  - Ramen Packaging - Red Onion  - Cilantro  - Minced Garlic - Ginger - Cayenne  Followed with pouring a bit of the broth into a bowl with my Ramen. Prefer my ramen slightly crunchy, not soggy at all. Finally I add chives, cilantro and salt for taste.
The only person who didn’t annoy me here is Cheyenne 😒 the rest of y’all suck
Olu was so confident, bahahahah
"It's salty"...Ramen is loaded with MSG wtf
The dude was such a critique omg
why they eating the dry ramen w a spoon :(
Cheetah girl needs to wash her armpits
I'm kinda mad they eating noodles with a spoon
Did anyone see the glitch in the video Here’s the timestamp 1:10 😭😭🥴✋
They ain’t even look broke lmao
"there's not enough shrimp"  The actual problem is shrimp is expensive and you broke atm you cooking it so yeah
Why are all of them black? Racist.
“It’s everything for me” 😂
I am surprised by the people who like watery ramen 😂 I pour all of it or most of it out. The noodles are wet but the whole thing doesn’t need to be
Olu got mean girl energy, I love Cheyenne’s energy she’s adorable
Is it me alone lowkey wanted  to see the reaction of them telling her she lost😑😑
Cheyenne cooked hers the way it should be with broth.
just what kind of ramen are these guys  cooking dafu
I was expecting forks not spoons haha
“Omg this is so racist” only black people that is racist
Tht second girl swore hers was the shi 🤣
What... Dry ramen-???
Ramen is soup...smh
The Nigerian girl just sayin she is the best but everyone hates hers
Producer: where did they go wrong  Marcus: they went wrong by cooking. periOd
It’s a hell no to all of them cause nobody has juice in it lmao
shut the Fuck up
Why tf are they using a spoon? How do u eat ramen with a spoon
so they not know ramen is supposed to be a soup
She wanted to win so bad so she said it’s salty
and this is why i stay humble
I mean in all of their defense, they all just made ramen based off where they came from, and what they liked personally. Everyone is different.
They don’t look broke bruh
“It’s wet!” Gurl what ramen supposed to be dry? Dryer then the Sahara dessert boo.....
Y’all a clowns for eating that ramen dry, it’s ramen soup what is this
Y'all Nigerian people eat mie goreng aka no soup ramen
Do people not know what ramen is😭😭 ramen has SOUP literally it’s noodles in SOUP
why is no one talking about how they are eating ramen with spoons?
I didn’t like the Nigerian girl she was so self absorbed and it made me mad
3:11 their reactions tho🤣💀
shout out to the shrimps 🍤
I put egg, hot sauce, and lime.
My ramen would beat them all, Cajun style
“broke college students”😭
So wait, where tf is the soup!!!!! Listen to me, why unuh a eat raw fucking ramen?? Unuh a fool?? Can't afford water?😭tf yo
It be the biggest shit talkers and the ones that complain about everybody’s else’s shit that lose shit is too funny
Sooo am I the only one that just uses the seasoning packet lol.... aint nobody got time to add no spice.
I’m ten years old and I can make ramen that my parents actually eat-   Ps: I’m 11 now lmao
No soup in these? Why? None of them know what ramen is.
That one girl that was hyping hers up so much was pissin me off. Her voice jus annoys me, and no one even liked hers🙄 girl bye.
This dude really pronounced Maruchan as *MIROOCHIN*

if u want good ramen find an international asian student.
They all did bad

Ramen is a soup, teach these idiots something
cheetah print girl was talking so much shit just for her ramen to be drier than a Popeyes biscuit
I feel like the Nigerian girl is scripted
Olu just hating
Did she say it’s 2 salty then said u need 2 add sum seasoning
Not gonna lie, that really ain't ramen at all and these guys even being "broke" could easily have made that "ramen" better by just following the instructions on the back of the ramen bag.
You can tell they are broke...  Clearly they could never afford internet to watch a tutorial on cooking ramen.
Next time add Mexicans, Asians, and such. They make the bomb ass ramen ever
I love how it says broke college students, and the cheetah girl is like it a to salty, there’s no color mine has all these expensive Nigerian spices, like who else eats there ramen raw because theyre so broke they can’t even afford water
I hate the cheetah print girl is crying about these comments because she was so bitchy 😭
Why on earth r they eating ramen with a spoon?!
Nigerian girl: my shit dat fya  Everyone: yo tf is this💀💀
moral of the story: do not be cheetah girl.
“I prefer my ramen dry: Doesn’t even cook it😂
COME ON UB ❤️
Why is all the “broke college kids” black.. it’s the colorism for me
bruh cheetah girl didn't even cook the noodles they were all dry and still clumped
Yooo wtf why are they eating RAMEN WITH A SPOON 😭😭😭
Okay but why are they eating ramen with a spoon
Ok that girl with all the hair and the cheetah pattern shirt mad annoying
Why did no one bring shrimp ramen, with limon & Valentina 😭
So yall not triggered that they all black?
ok ngl all the ramens sucked.  but still happy that *eXoTic sPicEs* cheetah girl only got a a 2 :)
the cheetah print girl made this video hard to watch bruh
Dude look like ybn cordae
I’ve noticed it’s always the cocky one’s food getting the lowest rating 👀
Why do they think it’s weird about the broth like it’s supposed to have broth.....
this makes you realize that people legit don't know what Ramen actually looks like, the title should be "Best INSTANT ramen" lol
why did nobody use any water lmao. It's a SOUP that happens to have noodles in it. Not pasta.
Everyone is talking about the girl with the Afro but I’m wondering why they’re eating the ramen with SPOONS!
It always the one that talks the most😂😂
Never in my life did I think that I would hear someone say that Ramen was too watery
"They were wrong by cooking period"
Uncultured swines... the broth MAKES the ramen..
The girl that said she was gonna win ended up losing karma hurts
None of em know shit about ramen 😂😂😂😂😂 I'm surprised they're alive if they ate this shit everyday for years 🤣
I am glad my mom thought me how to cook because even with just 10£ I can go out and buy ingredients for food that will last me a week. I pity all of you ☹
Moral of the story , none of them can make ramen😭
y’all shut tf up who gives af if someone keeps the noodle juice or not. everyone has their preference yall are hella weird
Cheetah print girl: this ramen is too watery... I like my ramen a little more dry...  The viewers: —oh we know....
Ms. cheetah girl needs so humble herself
I get it , you all were broke students , so why didn't you use the method that is written on the package. It's simple , effortless and perfect instead of making weird things and being mean and arrogant to the other dishes.
Why everybody so rude and full of them selfs
The first two looked dry as a bone and then those two complained that the last one was too soupy....which is the way it should be.
All broke college students are black?
I'm under the impression that most of these people on here are either actors or straight balloon heads 🤔
Ion like the cheetah girl 🙄it’s broke college ramen not fancy people ramen 😂
All three need a study abroad semester in Japan because this is not ramen. 😆
Watery? Girl u know its a *SOUP*  right?? Not everyone likes chunky ramen..
As a Nigerian we don’t claim mayowa
Am I like the only person that likes the broth????
These ain broke ways theses weird and bored ways
Where is the fork
1/2 on the title, y’all got the college kids but none of em broke. I’d bet none of em have had the classic ramen hot dog combo.
"The ramen has no color"  Miss girl what 👁👄👁  Ramen is supposed to look like ramen, yours literally has the same color 😭 plus yours look dry asf so that's a minus 😭 kdnxjsmsnzj 💀💀💀
This video is interesting...... i have NEVER SEEN DRY RAMEN ...like idk where the other two saw ramen made .. but yeah ....no
even the girl who did add broth didn’t even add enough ☠️
CHEETAH GURLLL NOOOO
No way the clumpy one was hers.. looked like there were no spices at all
"why is there water?" ramen is a soup...who tf eating dry soup?
the cheetah print girl is being so shady for what  ?
I make the best ramen noodles without adding anything. You just have to have the perfect amount of water and the cooking time but okay .
Me: wondering why the heck there eating with a 🥄 😤
“Im pretty sure mines gonna win” *cue disgusted look*
Soon as i saw the water and shrimp i knew who won
I've never had Ramen but isn't it meant to have soup? 😂
everyone: complaining about the cheetah print girl  Me: THEY ARE EATING RAMEN WITH SPOON >:((
I don't like water in my soup 😕
My ramen would bust the fuck down
the cocky contestants always get schooled in these type of videos
I just cook em real salty.  cuz i fuckin love salty food. not that much tho because my lips get dry
Cheyenne is so beautiful. Whats her IG?
bruh ramen is literally soup 😭
I’m Nigerian so Ik the spices she put is bussing but it’s a different culture so I’ll say I guess that why they probably don’t like it
ITS SOUP YALL WHY WOULD YOU EVER IT IT DRY SIS
they made it at home and brought it thats why theyre soft and lumpy 😐
there you see peoples who doesn't know the difference between ramen and spaghetti
Oluwamayowa is enchanting
I like the way I make my ramen 😂  Since I’m Mexican I add Tapatio and lime 🔥😆 And a little bit of consomate to add that reddish color and taste
Ramen has soup. you guys are eating ramen wrong, i love ramen 🖤
Please Nigeria doesn't claim her
Ramen is supposed to have juice in it 😂
“We have remen to save the day “ 😂
WHO THE FUCK DOESN'T HAVE RAMEN AS SOUP YOU NEED THE BROTH
i’m dead at this title 💀😭
if you don’t eat the water with ramen 👉🏼🚪
who eats ramyun without the broth, in Korea if you gave Ramyun without broth there is gonna be a problem. I hope someone takes all of them to an authentic Ramyun shop so they know the greatness of Ramyun.
It’s clear as day that these people have never had ramen correctly...😭
"Its so salty are you trying to kill me"  Also her: "you need add some seasoning to the noodles"   BEFORE YALL COME AT ME SOME SEASONINGS HAVE ADDED SALT
I thought this said broken college students, not broke. But, either way is correct.
This is the worst so far 🤣
wait, so do you guys remove like the soup part of the ramen and just eat it like noodles? WAIT WHAAAAT?
The order was 100% correct! I'd have a lil less water so the noodles can soak up more flavour. Clumpy ramen tho???? Ew.
"It's salty"  It's fucking ramen.
Why do they have a spoon for RAMEN
If you eat your noodles like the first two people ...you don’t know how to cook noodles correctly LMAO  Edit: who eating them dry unseasoned ass noodles
"Only the chicken has seasoning not the ramen" "Are ya'll tryna kill me this is so salty"
The cheetah girl died inside
Rd I like to pour some of the water out from my ramen BUT ummm why tf these noodles dryer than a bone? When she said “ it has water in it” uhhhhhhhhhh excuse me ? Might as well not cook them if you want them to be dry 😂
My name in sahin . With a simple spelling
Cheetah print girl has me disappointed-
5:38 thats pretty obvious
That cheetah girl is that one annoying kid who thinks she owns the world
"This shi looks dry as hell"🤣🤣
Are we going to talk about them using spoons?
I’m so broke all I use is tap water and the season they give me 😂😂💀
This is so weird..
“The ramen’s a bit watery” Wait isn’t ramen literally noodle soup wha-
They're just shading each other throughout the video lmfao
Ramen , Water, 3-7 minutes depending on microwave and how you like your noodle consistency, pour out as much water as you like left, tuna, mayo, mustard, ramen seasoning, seasoned salt, creole, garlic powder, black pepper, dash of salt, hot sauce (if you like spicy),  dash of adobe, cajuin seasoning, dash of tiger seasoning (limited in u.s), cheese on top and 2 slices of bread on the side. Best Ramen In The World🌎
The important question here is why are they using spoons to eat ramen...
Why did they have spoons
not olu saying "its too dry" then '' i love it on the dry side"
Ofc they all black smh
First off, who the hell eats ramen with a spoon, second, where is the broth aka water aka juice, them other two noodles are disgusting looking, if you’re going to drain all the water out replace it with some margarine at less.
Olu sound toxic no hate tho
lol these people dont even know what ramen is smh
The cocky ones always lose 😂
What the fuck
Cheetah print gotta gooo, the rest of the contenders was kinda valid tho
Ok then NEURO SCIENCE MAJOR go girl 😎😎😎 Congrats to the other students also🙂
couldn’t tell if nigerian shorty was being fr or putting on a act nevertheless shit was too much💀to have made the worst ramen on here and wanna talk shi😂😂
Haven't finished the vid, but just wondering do people confuse Indomie Goreng (or dried/fried type of noodles) with like regular soup ramen? *Instant noodles* can be either soupy or dry, but *ramen* is an actual soup-based dish. We can't really call Indomie Goreng (or any other type of dried noodles) ramen, no? 🤷🏻‍♀️
No one gonna mention how they eating with just spoons? 😂
all these people suck
I believe the best ramen is when there's soup(no one can change my mind)   " It's watery " , umm its ramen ?? Not stir fry noodles lol
My Asian soul is dying 😰 WHERES THE FUCKIN SOUP
I hope they paid her to act like that..   n hers was nasty
ramen can be overcooked and 'slimey' but it shouldn't be mushy from the broth/soup???
🤣😂 the Nigerian sista
all dey noodles look nasty
The other two really looked broke but the girl with the Afro hair had hoop earrings, a fancy ass shirt and was judging everyone lmao
stfu
I can see the curly haired girl acting in Attaway General
WHY DO THEY HAVE SPOONS EATING NOODLES 😡😡😡😡😡😡
RAMEN IS A SOUP!!   and how you broke and buying shrimp?
"my mum said if you don't have something nice to say don't say anything"  Proceeds to give a rating of (☞^o^) ☞"0"
The see through bowl though, so weird☹️
Ohki ramen with spoons seriously 😐
The girl with the afro sound cocky asf
is this a parody
the caption is a little...something
Why y’all keep saying it’s supposed to be eaten wet?.. A lot of people including myself, HATE the texture of soupy, wet ramen. We like to pour most of the water out and leave a bit to mix with the seasoning so that it’s not dry..
It’s like Americans don’t know what ramen actually is 😂
before a milly
For broke students who survived off ramen they really don’t know how to actually make it lmao. Girl... that’s spaghetti.
Who gave them a spoon?
Stop acting it don't matter what Ramen it is or how it's cooked you gonna eat it cause you know you didn't pay for the meal plan lmao
The title is “broke college students”, why are they acting picky? 💀💀
Can someone explain to me why this video makes 0 sense 🤔 let's just start with the fact that they using SPOONS FOR RAMEN?! This all looks awful!
Am I the only one who eats Ramen with a fork? Oh ok. I didn’t get the memo. 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣
See others in the comments coming at them for saying "it's too watery" Not all ramen is soup style, most of the ramen where I live have a fill line in a cup and when it's ready you just have the noodles 🍜
All they shit look nasty
I made some yesterday, had onions and carrots and added my favorite seasons and then an egg on top. Tasted so good.
Where the water at? Where the actual SOUP at? Y’all to broke to afford water but can afford chicken and shrimp?🥴
The African she seem like she tried to find EVERYTHING wrong with everyone ramen except hers with her clumpy dry ramen
Whaiiiiitttt THOOOOOOOOOO why is this all dry? Like they dont even have sauce or anythingggg its a noodle and bits tf💀
ano ba tong ramen nila parang pancit canton?
Olu: cocky, confident  Chey: sweet kind nice That dude: chill truthful
Why are their Ramen so dry? Am I the one who legit has actual SOUP in the ramen😭 or what I eat isn’t actually ramen but Ramyeon???
I love how this channel is All Black✊🏾✊🏿
Tf where the water at?
people still go to college?
My asian ass cringing in this, dafuq are these creations
Am I tripping or do these guys have no idea what ramen is?? I thought it was meant to be soupy
But who eats ramen with a spoon and why the other ones dry, where is the broth wtf
ramen is soup ....
Who else thinks those all looked trash
My African sister... what have u done 😭
My ramen would smoke all their ramens. 😂
I ain’t never had dry ramen. I’m hurt.
I didn't even know you could screw Ramen up that bad. At least the last one had something that could possibly be called a broth.  Chicken ramen, sriracha sauce and a egg. All you need for cheap good ramen.
Bro.... I’m 100% sure no one has tried Shin Ramyun or Korean Ramen except for well Koreans and others like you don’t understand how above it is in levels compared to regular ramen like it’s just 😫😫😫😫
why did they complicate things when you can buy instant ramen and cook it according to the packaging instructions?!???? no broke college student can afford shrimp
Cheetah print girl: "I prefer my ramen to be a little bit more dry."  Me: Sahara desert dry, that is.
All of their ramens are trash. But I would give the girl that actually left broth on hers a point because ramen is not suppose to be dry or clumpy.
Regular or hot picante ramen with a egg or 2, sriracha sauce, hoison sauce, chilli oil and the ramen packet and boom there you go 🔥
Dry ass Noodles😴
I’m sure that the cheetah print girl spices would be good but where’s the broth?
Y’all eat y’all ramen dry ??? Wtf I put hot sauce and lemon in mine snd and grandma adds eggs and veggies in hers
Are people really trying to mix up indomie noodles and ramen???? Ramen supposed to have water, Indomie doesn't. Am I wrong on this?????
imagine they had a secret chef cook their ramen
😂😂😂 not them looking for color and complaining on ramens being watery 😂 college kids for sure.
These all look horrible lol
after seeing these "variations" I can say, with utmost confidence, that cooking ramen normally would have tasted better...
I’m mexican and I grew up on maruchan and I’ve never seen anyone eat it without the broth?? am I the only one that ate it as a soup and not like a pasta?
The cheetah print girl act like we GAF about her "nigerian Spices"🤣😭
Okay can we just focus on the fact that they're eating ramen with a spoon!??
This whole video made me mad💀
The category isn’t the problem it’s the contestants and if it’s called broke college student how can you buy shrimp and chicken let alone cook it in college.
Where the hell is the broth!?!!
So like broth don't exist no more?
Man my ramen looks better than those three ramen
Who bout to whip out some of that prison spread (if you know , you know)
asian ramen better than this bs pls
"I'm sure mines going to win, bring it on😎" Cuts to next scene Marcus: "this shits dry as hell!"  🤣🤣🤣
The Nigerian girl is super biased lol 💀
If y’all don’t put no hot sauce & black pepper and keep it pushing😕
man my teenage ramen would send people to the hospital today i boil the ramen to al dente drain all the water then add the chicken flavor packet and hot sauce and stir the heat would finish cooking the noodles by the time you was ready to eat but have a glass of ice cold water to wash it down and not to much hotsauce you dont want it looking soupy if any tries to recreate this
I’m cringing, they eating noodles with a spoon 😩 then they like dry noodles 🤨
All they noodles looked nasty lol 😂 Wish I could have been on here 💀
hope the girl in cheeta fails college
I HATE how they are eating this with a SPOON
Sooo is it too salty or you want more salt?
wtf why are they eating it w a spoon 😐🤨
... why do they think ramen is not supposed to have broth
theyre all annoying but cheetah print girl gets on my NERVES its always the ones that talk the most smack that have the worst food
They need to make one with Asian college students. Now that’s content
Wtf just add sriracha to ramyun
Now where tf is the broth without broth it’s just cheap noodles
My ramen would have KILLLLED theirs
All the water? IT'S SOUP!!!😂
It’s always the one talking the most shit with the worst dish the most humble with the best lol
It’s always the one who thinks theirs is the best, that has the absolute worst one
they should have one person that tries all of the contestants dishes but is not actually participating in the competition, just so there is a non biased opinion because I’m sure most of these people are lying so that they win
Ok
Y the winner reminds me of de'arra tho👁️👁️
“It’s watery” *ramen clumps*
what the hell with that Mojave desert ramen, all those Ramen look bad now if you wanna see what Raman soup on a college  beget it let me come on this damn show. i could feed a family off of 3 packs.

cheyenne made ramen soup which last time i went to my grocery store and got a 0.79$ cup of ramen is how it’s meant to be
bro all those looked disgusting
I like my ramen on the drier side too but damn I still fully cook the noodles lmfao.
Have fro chick ever eaten authentic ramen?
Ewww
The ones that talk shit always the worst
Hold up. What BROKE college kids are affording chicken and shrimp to put in their Ramen?! I was lucky to have a lime wedge to squeeze into my Ramen.
This video is ass
all of these ramens look gross
At least use a fork, spoons aren't meant for dry ramen
Yallll, I fry sliced mushrooms, add poached egg, throw in a handful of spinach and add tapatio or sriracha and call it a day <3 best ramen 😭😭
All that talk for it to be that dry? Seriously, she should have just given them the ramen without the water in it.🙄
Did y'all kind of feel sick to your stomach while looking at they're "ramen" cuz every single one of them looked gross.
what in the spoon is going on here?
So, people out here eating dry ramen? Lol like, the best part of good ramen is the broth!
All they shii look dried out and over cooked yeauuuh no 😂✌🏾
Jesus Loves You! JESUS IS COMING! WE ARE IN THE END TIMES! Here’s some verse:  John 3:16-21 Ephesians‬ ‭1:13‬ Deuteronomy 31:6 “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Believe that Jesus came to earth, lived a perfect life, died on the cross for all our sins, and rose again -- trust Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins. Commit your life to following Jesus in return for what he has done. Commit to telling others about Jesus. When you choose to follow Jesus, when you hold to his teachings, God promises to always be with you. Your relationship with Jesus will grow daily. Choose him today!!!
Its watery and it has no color....sisss you made ramen rocks come on now😂
All they shii look dry and over cooked not at all😂✌🏾
Look its a clump😩
this girl said it has water in it 😒 ma’am it’s not meant to be eating dry , it’s not dry wall 😭
Bruh. They don’t know how to eat ramen?
All they ramen look dry and nasty
Lmao the Nigerian girl talked a lot I was expecting her to represent 😂😂😂😂
Sideshow Bob hair is a hater.
East Asians are crying...
They’re crazy. The juice is the best part!
Forget alldat! Who gave them SPOONS?!
Their saying they are broke yet they are adding all this extra stuff to their ramen they probably wouldn’t be broke if they just made “ramen”
Omg cheetah girl is a whole joke within herself. Too many non intentional jokes but the contradiction kills me 😂😂
bro i know im not the only one who eats the ramen like RAMEN not spaghetti lmao they shi was dry other than the last girls which actually looked appetizing to me
Their ramen definitely looked like they were broke. Were they cooking Maruchan ramen? I'm running away from anyone who tries to serve me ramen that looks like that.
Cheeta print girl annoying asf
you know you’ve failed when the nicest girl here be shading your ramen.
ok first off ramen is soup people, like ya it is gonna be watery it is the broth 💀 second i swear it is the people who are wayyy over confident in their food who always has the worst, every single time
The pickiest one made the jail ramen brick
I'm glad that girl lost she talked all that mess and got cooked
this cheetah print girl is pissing me off.
“A little bit more dry “...yeah, we know
Why the caption so disrespectful 😭
Guess the 2 with the "watery" comments were too broke to ever try actual ramen ....cuz then they would know that ramen has broth-_-
Would you eat shit or bugs to survive?
these kids either faking it or from another planet, so much judgement for their favorite weird creations of soup...
Love Cheyenne’s energy ❤️❤️
I make better ramen like what ! so disappointed lol
6:39 Girlllll you got a 0 and 2 ik you cant be talking my 9 year old sister could've got a higher rating then you and thats facts!
It’s crazy how the Nigerian female was talking the most stuff but she had the worst one 😂
“ramen is watery” 🙄   Ramen - japanese noodle soup.  Mazemen - a ramen dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce.
It's always one overly confident person who gets the lowest score.
cheetah girl keeps embarrassing herself..
it always the ones that talks the most shit and ranks the others the lowest that have the worst
Why nobody serve in the broth?  Side note who was adding shrimp to their Ramen while in college 🤔
I'm scared that they use spoons to pick the noodles up-
Where’s that broth?😂
Am I the only one who drains it and adds cheese n milk with the flavor packet. Plus a lil Adobo and lime
Where’s the broth in the “ramen”? You’re gonna make me sad, man
You bitches out here eating soupy ass ramen ☠️
all yall broke as hell and shouldnt be rating those ramen less than a 5 if you be eating them on the daily
I don't understand how come ramen and fast food is soo cheap but vegetables and eating foods that keeps you fuller longer are so expensive?
LMFAAAOO WHYS THE CHEETA GIRL TRYNA TALK WHEN HER RAMEN WAS DRIER THAN THE SAHARA LIKE BABESSS PLS
All 3 of them was hating like shit😂
maybe you could make.. actual ramen
Cheyenne was the only realistic and nice one... can you stop bringing like rude ass people on this series 💀
Is nobody else bothered they're using a spoon to eat ramen? It's chopsticks at best and a FORK at the bare minimum...
i already know that one girl thinks she’s superior to everyone cause of her cultural background 💀💀
The spoon is what got me 😭
She say add seasoning??
My broke Asian ass combined $1 ramen with $1 hot and sour soup
who cares if it has color or not? ARENT YOU BROKE?!
Ayeee I live in riverside
Yeooo😂 she talked all that shit about his ramen and hers looked like someone took a shit in it
This made me mad
None of y’all know how to make ramen bye asf🤣🤣
I normally just break the ramen brick up in the bag and then open the bag to dump some of the chicken seasoning in  Then I eat it like chips
Who says ramen like that lmao “raymen”
the fact that nobody knew how to make ramen.....  except for my girl cheyenne
i loveee when the person who talks the least smack scores highest. good for you girl   its a showing, not telling situation
Ramen is soup people.
In every episode there’s always one person I fucking hate without fail
The only thing I got from this is, "Do that cheetah girl know what ramen is?!?" Unless I've been eating ramen wrong all along, but I don't think so, and it doesn't even look appetizing.
Fake news ........that one girl was over acting her part 😂😂😂
It’s Always the one that has the MOST to say 😂
Where is the broth?!??
I mean. Their are 2 types if ramen. Authentic ramen and hood ramen. They met 0 standards of either. I'm a (self proclaimed) culinary student. And i adore food. Globally. And in terms of Japanese ramen? 0 all the way for all of them lmao. And as someone who grew up with food being a commodity in my area.  A FUCKIN -10. THEY JUST OUTCHEA DISRESPEKKIN THE DISH. They ain't strugglin financially. Look at her goddamn leapord print. They strugglin culinarily and mentally. They need a chefchologist.
funny how there isnt a single white person in any of these videos
I feel sad for people who eat their ramen dry af
idk how y’all eat that dry ass ramen. ITS SOUP TF. last soup was definitely the best one there
“Rayman”
Y’all in the comments: lots of black folk when growing up drains the water from the noodles
Bro ... my dude, ramen is a *soup* its supposed to be watery.
Why do Americans not like soup in their ramen. That’s the whole point
, "Umm.. it's watery.."  yeah it's ramen isn't it? Looking at theirs I think it needs MORE broth😂
Let me just hand you all a bowl of Maggi and call it a day.
I’m sure 90% of the people in the *comments* *can make better ramen than this*
They kept saying there’s a little water in it. It’s called ✨b R o T h ✨Ramen noodles is a soup people! She had me dead though when she said there’s a little too much water in here I like mine more dry.
Just add siracha, soy sauce, and spicy miso and your set
5:38  Yeahh we know
They be doing too much for some poor results. Just get some soy sauce, garlic chili sauce, or hot sauce combined with half the packet of the seasoning and call it a day????
miss cheetah girl thought she was Gordon  Ramsay 😭💀
Olu was to confident that shit look sticky as hell 👀
WHY ARE THEY SO MEAN IM SCREAMING
It's always the ones that do the most that flop 😂
Why none of the Ramen dishes have the broth in it ???
gurl bye they said they don't like the water its not water its SOUP LIKE THAT'S THE BEST PART OF RAMEN .
Hawaii would shut all of you down.
Lmao “this is too watery and I like mine kinda dry” yeah hun we get it your ramen is barely cooked😂
all that ramen looked wack i would win that bitch
I love the title! 😏
Oh lord our generations is doomed.
Olu was pissing me off like the color doesn't make it taste different 😒  and then she made sum nasty dry noodles than she called Marcus noodles dry when she chunck in hers
I laughed a little too hard at the title
How she talking about his ramen being salty when hers came in clumps...Hypocrite of the year🤣🤣
Why they call it water it is broth
all ramen needs is límon and valentina
do they not realize that ramen usually contains a broth? they would hate authentic ramen.
That 1 girl with the Afro talkin shit but doesn’t even cook her noodles
Embarrassing how do you people don’t even know how to cook Ramen noodles
The ULTIMATE RAMEN RECIPE: 1. Follow instructions of Maruchan ramen to the T! EXCEPT break up the noodles, smash them into little bits. Then boil. Keep the water, do not drain. 2. Ddd the entire flavor packet, CHICKEN FLAVOR ONLY. Every other flavor sucks. 3. Add FRESH lemon juice, half a lemon usually. 4. Add Tajin, 1 tablespoon but as much as you desire.  Enjoy the best noodle soup, perfect for a hangover. I promise you it's the best.
That picky one has no room to talk😭 like-
the bitch talked the most its the one that loss
Y'all ik what y'all mean but ramen isn't only soup😭 but yes shes big dumb for saying too watery like hunny...it's the broth
This was a whole mess😂🤣🤣
It always be the overconfident ones that have the worst one smh😭✋🏼
That cheetah print girl had me annoyed with the last meal she ate I was like just try it already. And no hate but I thought they said they were broke in college why they putting all these seasonings in there and shrimp  it comes with seasoning. And the other two people who made it with out water were yall to broke to have water or something cause were is it.
I'm curious what they think ramen is?
I don't wanna try any of their ramen LMAO who eats ramen without soup... it's not stir-fried mi goreng
Anyone else had a prison ramen burrito before? My brother showed me how they did it and it's actually good and be taken on the go.
Dude ramen recipe right here from a 12 year old  Add: slim jims and hot sauce and of course the packet of flavor
No no no... no more of this for me 🤣🤣🤣
I only drain some of the water cus wen that hot sauce splash in your eye....
Now who have em a spoon??? It’s RAMEN NOODLES 🙄
How I make ramen : Water  Put in the ramen whole not break it up  When it's not so tough put in the season Add parmesan and natural pepper and eat it with the broth..idk why they take out the broth 😭 😭
It's always the one talking the most shit😂😂 but I wish they had Asians trying broke Ramen from different cultural backgrounds, we all have different taste buds!
😂😂😂
Fake poor bruh. Imagine not eating it out of the packet after pouring in whatever you can. Smh.
the girl in the animal print shirt was just wow, talkin bout how there ramen was bad but hers was half cooked, bland, and dry as hell. smh
Everyone is coming at Olu like everyone else didn’t give their opinions about the others. Yeah she might have overdone it but they are literally critiquing each other, what do you expect lol.
The Nigerian girl acting like she’s the best but girllllll everyone hated it
american’s can’t even make a simple ramen lmfao
Um, everybody be taking bout the cheetah pattern girl, but like, am I the only one bothered at the fact they eating ramen with a damn spoon? Like am I the only one that eats ramen with a fork or chopsticks? Like, idk
GIVE THEM SOME BROTHHHHHHHHHHH
Shrimp is expensive
that cheeta print girl talking mad shit lmaoooo.
2:04 OMFG RAMEN IS SALTY????
the title made me giggle
Wait, I’m sorry, SPOONS?!
None of these people are broke, and they all trash cooks fr
The second girl " noodles are too mushy" its called being cooked right who tf eats hard noodles
First girl bitch n complain bout ramen being dry n shit like the dude is broke WTF YOU EXPECT STUPID
WHY DID THEY GIVE THEM A DAMN SPOON
“Broke college ramen” as they add meat 😂😂😂😂
It’s suppose to have the broth
The girl with the cheating hating on everyone but her meal was the worst 😭😭😭😭
Do ppl eat ramen with a spoon?? Like how do you pick up the noodle I gotta use a fork
Marcus funny af
just make the noodles, add  a bit of the seasoning packet, sriracha, red pepper flakes, a dash of peanut oil, oyster sauce/sesame sauce and meat. boom
I keep my ramen short, Lousiana hot sauce + lime
Olu- it has no color, is it supposed to????
All those were off and just no. Um it's a noodle soup I would think that it would have water in it
Ramen needs water... I literally made it today and ate 1/5 of the noodles, since ramen is mainly soup anyways.
And she thought she would win 😂😂😂
Broke college kids act like they make 350k a year doing professional food reviews
The ramen is watery????😭😭
No <3
No one:   Absolutely no one:   Me: Spoon?
Where is the liquid??!!
Idk i just get some spicy top ramen from a supermarket and atleast it got the broth like the broth helps a lot
Redo this with people who know how yo make ramen cause i dont know what they just made
why u had to say broke
Y'all are tooo funny in these comments n they even funnier making this video fr
why r they being so picky abt the ramen having “water” when that’s literally what ramen is meant to have 😭
This got me ducked up being a broke ass twenty years old my diner plans are chicken and chicken ramen lmfao fml  Oh no auto correct you bitch
LMAO so you guys know those mama noodles?? this isn’t exactly ramen but like whatever but when i was a kid i always put the seasoning in and eat it raw
They can’t make noodles
Was this a joke
Yikes this video was draining to watch
They can't be that broke. Part of what makes ramen filling is drinking the broth (aka the "water") to feel full 😆
Cheyenne's was the only one that looked like it had some moisture. I like my ramen wet and flavored. It could have a little more melanin to it and shrimp, but those other two were looking dry AF.
I didn’t know ppl made dry ramen?
Not the Nigerian getting the worst rating😭 Indomie challenge would've definitely gone better!
I prefer my ramen to be a little bit more dry. Well that explains ALOT.
Ppl are actually out here eating and enjoying dry Ramen, i’ll never understand
Abegggg she said she couldn’t even fathom how broke she was😭😭😭😭
It feels slimy because you put water in it to cook it, then you dump the water and it’s slimy, like what do ya expect?
I don’t like none of y’all🥲
Them  noodles was dry
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon?
the amount of criticism they gave over ramen packets 💀
i mean their broke college students...maybe water isn’t in their budget😭💀💀
Cheetah print girl pls bro just stop
Never had dry ramen ever in my life!
Do these people not know what ramen is ? 😂😂 it’s a marketed soup . Lmfao
I always leave a little water in my ramen so it can be juicy and am I the only person that eats my ramen with a fork? This is the first time I've seen people use a spoon!
Chicken ramen, water drained, add seasoning, can of drained chicken, 1/2 can of italian tomato sauce and french style green beans 💯😋
now the one with liquid i know it was the best one😂 the other foos is weird asf
when she said nigerian spices i knew that shi was finna be trash😂
u can tell who’s is the trashiest because they talk to much about seasoning and flavors and spices😂
these college kids need a cooking lesson on how to cook ramen . the one girl ramen with broth looks actually good .just missing some herbs . and more. other spicy. and yes ramen is suppose to be like a soup.
Cheetah girl be doing to much who puts color to ramen
YOU GUYS EAT YOUR RAMEN WITH NO SOUP. MAD WACK
Ok but the girl and the boy they was just doing to much and the girl with the ponytail she was kinda nice tbh 😌
So is Marcus’s Ramen salty or does it lack flavor Olu? Make up your mind
The girl with the braids remind me of Dearra from Ken and Dearra vlogs
1. All they ramen look nasty as fuck especially the chunky one 2. Ramen is techniqually is traditionally served with broth. In my opinion I like my packet ramen you without the broth I leave a little cause it can get dry but not enough to drink it after but for the ramen that comes in the cups and bowls I leave the broth.
Cheyenne is pretty asl. Tell her I said hey lol
What broke college student got shrimps in they room???👀 explain chile
They burnt
Fish? ... shrimp? Y’all ain’t broke 😂😂😂
Honestly I’m 12 and I can cook ramen better than them or anything better than them
Obviously its gonna be wet and has the water. Its ramen not fried noodles or soba
4:03 omg lol cheezits probably taste better
Lmfao! This is what broke looks like in 2021! Chains ,jewelry,  brands ...
It’s soup wtf 🤦🏽‍♂️
ramen is literally a soup. soup has broth...
I hate the cheeta print girl stright bitch vibes
"And we have raymen" Go, Go now, The door is to the right
The girl with the cheetah print girl was doing the most
"I prefer my ramen a little dry" yeah...we know
Covid joke was fire tho, reminds me of when the sock is on the monster in monsters inc.
“It’s salty” ramen is fuckin salty you idiot 😂 that girl with the Afro is so arrogant
I don’t and can tell ppl don’t like the Cheetah girl 😂  Edit/update: i knew Hers was gonna be the worst 😂🤣
Raman is soup but people who eat spicy raman without water yall dont say anything tho..
“Its watery” yeah... soup does that
Did the girl say SALTY I should slap her silly
“its too salty”  “season the RAmen the RAmen matters.”
Where is the BROTH?!😭
i thought i was the only one they got the Sahara noodles🍜😕
they arent that broke i think
Where the broth at???😤
The most arrogant people with the most to say got the worst food 😭
I know a lot of people are coming at the “cheetah girl” but remember that they are all stating their opinion. This is a literal contest. Not everyone is going to talk the way you would like them to talk. She thinks the Ramen was dry and was to salty. Who cares. Her opinion. Just like how every other contestant stated their opinion.
wtf ramen is made broth
where’s a broke white college student
She talked all that sh*t to serve them brick ramen. She got on my nerves.
“It’s watery” Duh! They acting like ramen is suppose to be as dry as granola
Olu straight out just being a hater like tryna find a reason as to why the others ramen aren’t good like girl what color are ramen talking bout red 🙄🙄
Am I the only one who just puts in the flavor packet🧍🏻‍♀️
do black ppl commonly eat their ramen dry?? serious question
The purple shape arespectively refuse because justice endoscopically trip throughout a broad sled. polite, abundant anime
I mean idk the ramen selection in the US. But the pretty good ramen like kimchi and curry thats cheap. Why go out of your way to make it disgusting?
So I’m guessing they never heard of the cup maruchen
How do I sign up for this ?
Yo how you gonna put ramen out there like that? Y’all don’t know how to cook if you eat the same thing everyday
The biggest shit talkers always have the worst dishes 😭✋🏼😂
All these contestants are trash
the way she left the chunk on the table 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 and the nicest ones always win 😭
the way she left the chunk on the table 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 and the nicest ones always win 😭
i dont like the girl with the wack hair  she so critical for ramen???
This is NOT a college kid's ramen. If this is their college "broke" ramen...they don't know what broke is lol
Why no one talking about how they eating ramen with a spoon
Y’all wanna know how y’all get easy cheap American college student ramen that’s BUSSIN?!? Just add butter and hot sauce to your finished noodles. That’s it. And they better not be dry asf either
lol them says at Clark Atlanta were hard.. pros of going to school in ATL and also being from ATL , was I could always go home and eat if I was just broke down bad lol
If you want REAL instant ramen reviews, check TONTANTIN, he's been on Youtube since 2006... and I find his ramen review and ratings more realistic and interesting. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7ZVAfq2MR14FJuJbFSYVg
All of them look and sound stupid😂
Cheyenne and I have the same name lol
This shit look dry asL....I'm dead...
Why they so picky I thought they were broke
Bowl of bread crumbs? He could’ve jus said bowl of cereal lmfaoo
why they eating it with a spoon-
Tbh they all look bad like if i saw theme I wouldn’t eat them mine is so much better
Where’s the diversity
That bitch got me heated
you know how bad a cook you have to be to fuck up packaged  ramen? the ingredients are given to you. All you doing is boiling the noodles in water or in the microwave.
why are they eating it with a spoon 😐
I guess, this is exactly what it is... they're rating on what "They" created amongst themselves. But their preference on "instant ramen" is ameteur at best... "wet..", "salty..", "not flavorful..." and using a spoon?!, Authentic Ramen is all that and more! They come in dry, soup, or Tsukemen (meets dry and soup in the middle)!  Umami! They need to go venture out of their comfort zone of just American Ramen (Maruchan... Nissin Top Ramen...)
As an Asian person, Cheyenne knows what she's talking about 😌 dry cooked ramen w oyster sauce, lime, a little sriracha and some sesame oil and a fried egg is the best
"There's water in there" YOU MEAN THE BROTH?!?!?!? LIKE, THE MAIN COMPONENT OF THIS LITERAL SOUP!?!?! What are they doing to kids in America?
bro what are these ramens
Leopard print girl really thinkin she run the show I’ll give the shrimp girl a pass that’s jus confidence but fuck leopard print girl gotta go
Why aren’t they using forks??
How can you be this delusional? She couldn't even cook fucking ramen properly. what the fuck
Dman I probably make better ramen than them.
All they ramen dry 💀
This gotta be a joke cause the Nigeria girl she tried to act like her food was all good like sis sit down and the guy he just lost all in the sauce
cheetah print trying too hard to be the mean girl
Ground pork, peanut butter, hoisin sauce and a little of the water you used to boil it (put the sauce together stir it into the noodles) y'all fucken welcome
The first 2 grew up rich and became poor
Isnt this Carl from Jimmy Neutron??
“maroochin”
Title should read "American Soupless Instant Ramen (Maruchan or Nissin)"... Cause there is much better instant ramen brands and flavors out there! They need to get their taste buds blown by trying new things, other than just American Ramen (Maruchan... Nissin Top Ramen...)  Nongshim: Shin Ramyun Black/Light/Regular, Chapagetti, Neoguri, Champong, Bowl/Cup Noodles Ottogi: Jin Ramyun (Spicy) Samyang: Samyang Ramyun, Hot Chicken (Variety flavors) Nissin: Tonkatsu, Shio, etc., Cup Noodles (Variety flavors from Japan) Sapporo Ichiban: Tonkatsu, Shio, etc. (Variety flavors from Japan) Myojo Chukazanmai: Soy sauce, Oriental, Hiyashi Chuka, etc. (Variety flavors) Prima Taste: Laksa, Curry, etc (Variety flavors) Mama Noodles: Shrimp Tom Yum, Pork, Duck, etc. (Variety flavors)
BROKE college students...We couldn’t afford shrimp or chicken!! You ate it the 25 cent way it came!!
No way ,,I bet they broke collage students cuz they parents froze they   Allowance money
All of the noodles look nasty
HAHAAAAAAA OLU GURLLLL YOU HAD THE WORST RATING WITH SO MUCH TO SAY HOW EMBARRASSING I AM ROLLING AND CREASING 🤣🤣🤣🤣

That good no it’s good quite lying I literally eat my noddles like that but where the hot sause
Broke college kids 💀
It’s always the ones that talk the most shit😂😭karma
I like my noodles “wet”
"There's not enough shrimp" Well, it is ramen made by broke college kids, how many shrimps did you expect to be in it?
Dude was just looking for something to complain about with that third ramen. How do you expect her to have more shrimp?! It’s supposed to be broke college student ramen! The shrimp should’ve never been there to begin with. 😭 I’m glad she won anyway. Looked better than both of the others.
I know literally all other comments are about this but I can't stress enough that it's RAMEN SOUP not ramen chips😭 Why are they complaining that there is water in it? It's like complaining that there is pasta in spaghetti😭😂😂
She talked all that shit about the other ramen and seasoning and her ramen was in big chunks 😭😭 girl stop
nah , y’all wayyy too picky
Now they didn’t have to put “Broke College Kids”
Girl wit the Afro think she better than everybody🤦🏾‍♂️ says it’s to salty then complains about the ramen having no seasoning
Imagine the one who got the lowest reacting to what she got... LOL
The video title is killing me.
They are weird they know that 3rd ramen good asf
This is hilarious. All they ramen is very much their own version of struggle! My Naija sis was cockyyy with it! I would like to try ata gungun in ramen but it seems like her cooking method was still a struggle lmao. I don't know why people think they have to be rude to others in order to look cool in these videos because they all made very college-level meals lolll
lol if I was in this video I would win right away haha and it would be gluten-free! 😂👏🏽👏🏽they judging each other so harshly but they legit all looked the same.
“Like are you tryna kill me.. eh 😫🥺😖” like girl this is not popular girl elementary-
“It has water in it?” Bitch wtf it’s NOODLE SOUP dumbass
Neither of them can make Ramen. 👍
wtf, yall be eating your ramen like spaghetti
Cheyenne sounds just like jayda cheaves
None of their ramen looks good 😭😭
Here is how I make mine.  Ingredients : garlic, onion, green onion, chili flakes, brown sugar, msg (any of these are optional but not the garlic. Feel free to add any seasonings you prefer. I sometimes use a little bit of the prepacked seasoning.) Sauce : oyster and soy sauce (It is very easy to make it salty be careful.)  1. Soak the ramen in hot water. 2. Sautee the garlic and onion or any vegetable you have in some oil and caramelize them with the brown sugar  (cooking the ramen will not take long. Use trial and error until you get your veges to perfect doneness.)  3. Add the sauce and let it evaporate for a bit then put in the ramen. 4. Add in the other ingredients until its cooked.  This will get you a dry stir-fried ramen. If you want it more saucy, either omit step 1 and add some water along with the ramen in step 3 or just add a little lesser amount of the hot water from step 1 during step 3(If left soaking in hot water for too long, the ramen will get mushy very fast while cooking). Not the best, not the worst(at least for me). If you enjoy it let me know :)
Who eats noodles with a spoon 🥄
These kids ain’t broke enough
Lol
all y’all ramen look nasty 😐. especially cheetah print shawty
Tell me you're a college student in America without telling me you're a college student in America.

The level of neoliberal dystopia in one video. whew
Girl With The Fro Was So Cocky And She Lost🤣🤣
"I like my ramen dry"....yeah both of the other contestants and the world that watched can tell she likes her ramen dry. She was so stuck up its unreal.
I love how they was hating on the one girl with shrimps in her ramen 🍜 when they know that shit was good one dude go say it was good but changed his mind like get tf outta here you know that shit was good and who don’t like a little juice in they ramen 🍜 it makes it taste better that you eating some dry ass noodles with no juice
I bet you anything at least one of them saw the ramen and tiktok made it and called it their own
She was talking so much shit w her chunky noodles
they ALL look foul
you guys should blame white people for being broke
Ever since I seen auntie fee ramen casserole video that’s the only way I eat it
bro how she talk all the talk then manage to ruin every property of ramen literally had the lowest score out of everyone
Why all those noodles look dry, where’s the soup? I don’t like it drowning in soup but I don’t like it dry either
Why did they give them a spoon and not a fork?
All their ramens look nasty tbh.
🤣🤣 she said “it’s everything for me “
yall gave them spoons for Ramen??
i throw an egg in my ramen at the end of cooking and stir it up to make a ghetto egg drop ramen
girl in cheetah print rubs me the wrong way “my ramen has flavor” “my ramen is so much better” “this has too much salt “ yet “season your ramen” girl take your big head somewhere else
this seems more like chow mein than a ramen dish no offense.
Dramatic... exactly what i expect from this generation
These are not ramenn!!!!!
OLU needs to sit her ass down somewhere.
There’s always one that thinks they’re the best so they rate everyone crap scores. Smh
LITERALLY. just eat plain ramen yall dtm 😂
This shit so rasict
At this point they should've just called them noodles 😂 because only one out of the three had water in the bowl and she had a little more for my taste and Cheetah Girl was doing the most
It looks ✨kinda dead✨ GIRL BYE
The man looks 14 almost 15 years old
Y'all straight disrespecting ramen🤦🏿‍♂️💀
They all have disgusting ramen wtf can’t you do a simple ramen dish
That one girl was so confident and they really did her like that lmaoo
She said salty its ramen duh
Why are they asking opinions about asian food from not asian people?

Remin? Ra-min Ramin
americans keep calling them dry ass noodles ramen makes me mad and sad at the same time
Ngl...all of these look bad...even for a broke college student ..lol idk maybe cuz I grew up eating ramen a lot lol so I'm like I would have out in herbs, broth, meat, egg, lol
Im confused isn’t ramen a soup lol the other two were making pasta not ramen 😂😂 they need to start showing they’re reactions to the scores because the ones with the most Criticism always loses they need a reality check!!
Soup is not suppose to be dry😂😂😂
Olu: Mine is the best im gonna win.     ***gets a 2***

Bruh how do they eat ramen with no juice  Like that’s the best part

I Would've Came With a Plain Cup Of Noodles For 35 Cents. Im A Broke College Student.
Everyone eats there noddles different some like them dry and some like them a tad bit wet and some like em watery
Just eat it dry and put the packet on it. That’s the way I would’ve served it. Ghetto chips
Y so fuxkin dry
Everybody loses for eating the ramen with a spoon🤦🏾‍♂️
Always the people who have the most to say lossss
Just crack a egg in it make it 0.5x better
Ramen has juice dont disrespect ramen by making it dry af 🤦🏽😂
My ramen would’ve blew everyone out and the water
Why did they give them spoons
Ata gun gun 😂😂💓💓, I felt that 😂. Who else is from Nigeria
All the broke college students are black. Ok
Ramen is supposed to be soupy.  Lol
They all seem like really cool people but I swear they contradicted each other and themselves 😭😂
Sis with the curly hair was so confident 😂 ma’am had ramen blocks not noodles
“I prefer my ramen to be more dry” we know
Ramen is not suppose to be dry lol tf ppl are weird but everyone is different
their ramen look bland. I use smoked sausage, egg, and seasonings. Sometimes I add cheese. And if I don't feel like making that, I make korean style ramen. I get the chili paste and boil it and add cheese
All y’all ramen was trash asf I’m highly disappointed except the one the shrimp it was ok the rest never ate ramen until today
Olu girl u finessed urself
A nigga like me would’ve made a brick on here LMFAOOOO
I had to do a double take when I heard that name
Why are all the noodles dry??
Put me in coach lol I have the best ramen
If you make your ramen dry...you live a sad life honestly. Ramen is soup, if you don't leave that dang on water in there or make a broth 💀💀
Im glad the girl who was complaining so much lost. She was very ignorant and annoying
I love crunchy ramen hehehe
Am I the only one that's a bit disturbed that they are eating noodles with a spoon? I normally use a fork or chopsticks and then drink the broth/soup afterwards. Oh and it isn't watery. It's broth/soup.
I cannot taste the sugar, I cannot taste the nutmeg...!??!
Dang she went off on how everyone’s sucked and here she is losing! 🤣 it’s always those types of people that lose these kind of things 🤣😂 the Cheyenne one actually looked super yummy and I’m a huge fan of shrimp she had my vote for sure!!, also may I add she’s gorgeous! 🥰
the second i saw the first one’s turn i knew who lost
WHY IS THIS RAMEN ALL DRY
2:57 what triggers me the most in this vid is the fact that they eating ramen with a spoon
ppl out here actually eating dry ramen?? tf? ramen has always been a soup with a good stock, the noodles has never been where the flavor comes from.    but none of their ramen looked good. also that Nigerian girl came off pretentious  af... you a broke college student who cares what it looks like you just trying to eat lmao.
Notice how they have spoons? Also, the first one is how almost everyone eats it when broke, if you have the ingredients as is, but at the same time mans likes dry ramen.
WHY ALL THE BLACK KIDS HAVE TO BE BROKE
People... It's ramen noodle SOUP. SOOOUUUP!
I mean my guy you didnt have  to say broke and its the fact that they're all african american...
*BROKE college kids try each other's ramen*      Nobody gonna talk about this
The problem with this is that ramen doesn't travel well
The fact that I use that one popular Korean ramen and add a bunch of stuff. But I feel like they would hate on it for that id
Ima be real. I don’t add shi t to my ramen. Just outta the packet. I guess I have you fools beat by a mile.
I was watching for 5mins before noticing that they're eating noodles with a spoon. How many of y'all eat like that?
What's up with the ramen in clumps? It's got a different vibe alright.
The only one I would eat is the last one and the rest looks disgusting
i bet these kids are the ones talkin ahit that white people cant season food meanwhile their “ramen” is a disgrace to the instant noodle history
am i the only one who likes a lot of water in his ramen? like a bowl of soup
I'm not watching this.  Ramen noodles by themselves not even considered a "meal" but more a snack.   Bye.   Lol
I feel like broke people, and these "broke" people, have completely different views of what being "broke" actually means...  These kids claiming to be "broke" think it's cool and that struggle adds value to the image they want to portray.
It's always the ones who talk the most that end up losing
Ok but WHY are the eating it with a SPOOON
How did y’all fuck up ramen like this😪
Olu is such dramatic
I just put an egg and some hot sauce in mine and call it a day.
Honestly They all suck at making ramen 🍜 even as a college kid myself my ramen is way better than this and it’s cheap 🤦🏽‍♂️
Y’all mad cause they said it’s watery ? Some people don’t like too much water in their ramen. I don’t like mines watery and I like it seasoned so even tho she was being rude I understand the “it has no color”
I wonder how annoyed traditional ramen chefs get upset when people say they like their ramen “dry” like the broth is legit the most important part is it not😭 besides the noodle and the toppings, the broth is like the body to the whole meal. Ik Traditional ramen chefs cringe😭
Broke? The clothes and jewelry they are wearing says otherwise
the way the cheetah girl was SO confident abt ger ramen the she got rated a 2/20 😂
All y’all stuff look dry and clump up no sir 🤣🤣🤣🤣
No but like 12 year old me can make ramen better than all of them-
This ain't no ramen.. it's just noodles
Cheyenne deserved to win
This ain’t ramen. This dry noodles. Like what? 🤦🏿
They’re all so annoying...
They really complainin bout soup in their noodles...
Naruto would collapse-
Mannn all they had to do was add some pepper, seasoning salt, a lil sprinkle of garlic powder, hot sauce, add steak or chicken even cut up pork chops if u want🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Watching this as a final year student eating dining hall food which i slathered with mayo and tomato sauce for taste😂😂😂😂  Plus dreading the 3 packs of noodles i have in my drawer
I could’ve won
If you broke how you got shrimp
1. Ramen prepared by a Mexican bomb 2. A fuckinnggg Spoon wtf
Cheetah girl complains to much but hers was crusty
Miss girl THOUGHT she was going to win😂😭
None of them know how to cook noodles
Imagine being pretentious about your 50 cent ramen 🙄
It's always the shit talkers that have the worst recipes
That’s not ramen that’s crusty noodles
They don’t know what ramen is lol.
BRuh i should be on this show
why are they eating wit a spoon
I can't even afford seasoning😭
Y’all used the wrong people 😂😂😂
"I like my ramen dry" we can tell brick layer
I can tell you guys how many times she said  vIBeS💅
That’s why I live with my mama while I’m in college, I ain’t ready to be broke 😭
So passionate for Ramen...
Were they all dry cause they absorbed all the broth by the time the video started?
No shit it’s not fancy ramen 😆😆😆
Sorry to that man lmao if you know you know
Cheetah girl gotta go. She so dry ... but so is her ramen
Can u have them try real ramen so they understand ramen is supposed to have soup
nigerian ramen is commonly known as indomie...its usually not watery like typical ramen...but its never clumpy like that
It suppose to be watery!! It a SOUP.. and the last girl ownnis the best... PERIODT!!!
I wouldn’t have eaten any bodies ramen but the girl that won honestly , ramen is NOT supposed to be dry !
Ramen is suppose to soak in the both ... that’s what gives it it’s flavor
All of you made sad ramen
Where is the soup, why are the noodles so dry looking
It’s ramen calm down Gordon Ramsey
Miss cheetah got humbled quick lmao
How you gonna crack on everyone else’s ramen but your ain’t even cooked all the way
I WOULD HAVE BUSTED EVERYBODY ASS IN THIS COMPETITION!!
How you broke and got money to add shrimp and chicken? Lol.
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WET ITS SOUP 🍜 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
"Side of the street" yooooo😂😂
That girl with the cheetah print shirt came in way too confident and made faces at others ramen and nobody liked hers 😂   Also they keep saying it’s wet... like.. Yeah, it’s soup 🍜
This vid should be titled “broke students attempt to make ramen for the first time” .... it’s obvious none of them have ever had ramen 🍜
Man y’all are weird asf, like some broth isn’t bad, but then again they like it dry..? Like REAL ramen is like a soup, like being in some onion, a meat, a fried egg, a savory broth. Like man oh man

Cheetah print women.  I like my ramen a bit dry. Serves block of HAY!
Shawty out here spoiling nigeria's name. We do not cook our noodles like that nor are we nearly as rude as her.
“I DoNt LiKe ThE wAtEr” ITS SOUP YALL. Ramen is noodles and soup. You want dry ramen then you eat stir fry, head ass lol
Shrimp ramen, throw some garlic powder and old bay in the pot, drain the water, put the shrimp packet and some fried shrimp on top. Game changer.
I know bruh ain't talking about sis noodles being wet when just looking at his made my throat dry.  She had the best one just by looking at them .
Shrimp girl only won because hers was the lesser evil.
They making all those stupid ass faces like any of their ramen actually taste good.
Lmao can you imagine being like "I like my soup a little dry" 😭😭
I meannn her hair was cute but she talk too much and her ramen looks nasty🤢😂🤦🏾‍♀️
All of them were pretty rude,like why are you being so judgy about 'broke' college kid ramen. The keyword is broke, it's not supposed to be fancy.
Why are they confused that it has water like tf have they ever had actual japanese ramen I-
I really came here to find a fire recipe for my ramen
Am I weird or they weird for complaining a ramen being wet. Nah they definitely the weird one.
All u need is cheddar cheese and hot sauce
Curly head girl just pulled that out the pack and put it in a bowl
No ones talking about the fact that they gave them spoons to eat RAMEN NOODLES lmao
As an Asian, I'm so sorry for y'all in the west>_>
do they even know how to cook
Struggle ramen is eating the block dry with some peanut butter slapped on there
Where the hell is the broth in any of them??
now this is just embarrassing
i'm pretty sure ramen is supposed to be 'watery' cause its supposed to have soup with it?
Bougieness  and  E G O 's
I make better ramen then all of them and I’m in 8 grade 😂
They eat it with a SPOON??? You can even get the noodles with a spoon
"It's wet," You all realize ramen is supposed to have broth?
She said she prefer her ramen dry ... yes girl we saw that , its always the cocky ones that lost in past episodes and now this one ...
Please so what are you adding crayfish to noodles for??!😒

curly head girl talked the most shit and her shit dry asf😂😂😂they aint even wanna rat it
Where’s the juices
who tf eat the ramen that dry😂😂
Ummm also although your not suppose to go heavy on the soup. You should drink your broth it'll fill your broke college student self....  P. S cook basic rice and add the rice after the noodles let the rice soak in the broth... Youre welcome broke kids
Cheyenne is the most humble ome here. She was taught good. I like her personality!
guys chill out she is Nigerian she is used to live without water chill out on her         im black btw dont cancel me
Bro....YALL USING A SPOON WTFFFFF
"A ramen is a bit watery??" It's a frickin ramen !!!?
If you look at my video I make one of the best ramen found. Instant Ichiran ramen. My video destroys theirs visually and taste wise I destroy them..
The best way to make ramen is to add a bit less water than recommended and cook it just a little bit longer than recommended but before the water boils off add any ingredients for the sauce (soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil). The ramen shouldnt be dry but there should almost be a glaze over the noodles. Mix in sriracha and top with dried seaweed if you want. Deadass the best sticky noodles
"my ramen good my ramen be bussing ima win for sure" her ramen: 3:52
The two other people's ramen look... Interesting...
We can all make better ramen than theirs 👏🏻 get us all on there
They are complaining that the ramen has water in it... Hmm... I guess I been eating ramen wrong my whole life 😅
Why is Cheyenne’s the only one with moisture 😭 the other two’s look so dry
the curly haired girl have some inflated ego tertials bro, she spoke shit about every ones ramen and continued to praise her ramen witch later turned out to be shit sooo....
She said struggle ramen
Bro I dont get why they getting cocky for ramen
Bruh cheetah girl u like yo noodles dry... I just can’t- it’s soup girl...
"The added chicken to it which is pretty odd"  The Ramen companies who have Chicken flavored ramen: Am i a joke to you?
Girl shut up with the crawfish ting, your stuff don’t even look cooked😂
Someone tell olu that its taste video not sales one. Stop selling your ramen ffs
I'm glad Cheyenne won, she felt like the only honest one. I wish people would just have confidence in what they made instead of being haters to manipulate the points in their favor
Looooool she got a 2
Ramen without broth is a sin eat my shoes if you disagree
ok to start of ITS NOT RAMEN i hate when people say that its called oodles👏and👏noodles👏
Water Chopped Onions  Onion Powder  Garlic Powder  Black Pepper (Flavoring that came with the ramen) Hot sauce  That’s it.  Simple.  Not rocket science.
The ramen is supposed to have water. It’s noddle soup dumbasses. The third girl made hers the best. Who tf eats dry mushy noodle soup
😂😂😂😂😂
SHE, she was annoying 😖
olu rlly thought she can cook like uf u cant cook 1 cent "ramen" than u just should cook at all
The girl with the Afro was so cocky yet she still lost
These don’t look like ramen...
“My mom is Spanish” 🚪🚶🏾‍♀️
Omgggg y’all look at Cheyenne UB!!!! You know !!!
WHY THEY RAMEN DONT HAVE WATER
pls why did the eat RAMEN with a SPOON
Not “ broke” college kids 😂
Cheetah top girl speaking like she's the Gordon Ramsay of Ramen yet she served people a rock. Ma'am. Sit.
Notice how they all black 💀
Maroochen??? Uhhh
Why do you americans drain the noodles?!?! After all the television and youtube videos I've watched growing up that featured americans making instant ramen, they always end up with dry ass looking ramen! Funny how the dude at the end was roasting the noodles for being "flooded" with SOUP/BROTH(it's not water) saying it looked like it didn't have any flavor, and later realizing that it was the best of them all, and that because it actually had some broth! You guys know that's where most of the flavor comes from right? if you guys wanted noodles without broth, try stir fry! And don't worry if you're broke! There's some instant stir fry as well!
she really complained about it not having color 😭
This is so confusing 😂 Ramen is soup. Why are people making it dry lol?
Crayfish??? ON WHAT BUDGET SIS
People in the caribbean who are watching this would be like 👁🕳👁😂🤣
Crayfish, chicken, & shrimp lol how is that broke?
Ayyyyy. She went to the Port for college 😂😂
It’s kind of unfair though. They had to bring the already prepared ramen
Why y’all eatin oodles and noodles with spoons
The girl wit the afro is cocky asl she pissing me off
i like how everyone refers to cheeta print girl as cheeta print girl bc her name is so long
Cheetah print girl really annoyed me
Bikin indomie goreng aja
They shouldn’t be dry so yea I bet number 3 was better 🥰🥰
0:44 she DID NOT say rEmen 😖
Remen
It's a soup wtf🙄
curly girl is so confident wow but nooooo
Once she mentioned it was nigerian it was the cut bcuz not many ppl are used to Nigerian food 😭
Girl : are you trying to kill me  *miranda sings entered the chat*
They make shit ramen 🙄🤚🏾 come to my house I make the BEST RAMEN. Soup/or no soup it’s you choice 🤌🏾
Then just make fried noodles....honestly...they should check out how Hawaii makes em...a fusion of flavors to behold.
“I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry”, Yeah we know 😂
Isn’t ramen supposed to be soup base- noT drY yaLl tHe aUdaciTy to sAy iTs toO wEt...hMmM yaLl beTteR tRy reAl rAmEn
“It’s salty, are u trynna kill me” ahhhhh I died 😭😭💀💀😭😭😭😭😭😭 and this girl said next like there was even more contestants 😩
the broke college student put shrimp in their ramen, very broke very cool
i thanked god when i saw the last one, girl saved the day. why their ramen was so dry????
Nigerian girl can't even say Ramen properly and she bashing his Ramen.
So happy the ramen with water won. It’s a soup dish my g.
Talm bout too much “water” bitch that’s broth
“Too much salt” next clip “SeAsOn ThE rAmEn”??? Da fuq
Do they not know how to cook ramen or ......
Ms. Cheetah print is just one of those people who will never have anything good to say about others. The guy's own was to dry yet hers was like biscuits and when she got the other girl's own she said it was too wet and that she liked her ramen more dry. Bitch if you don't GTF!
Their concept of ramen is wayyyyy off... Search up 'ramen' on google and the result would be a noodle in a soup.. Why r yall talking about it being wet??
Bruh it’s always ALWAYS the ones who be feelin themselves the most and bashing the most that has the most trash.   I’m mad these folks don’t realize that ramen is normally served in liquid. If anything for wholesome a struggle meal the liquid would be great to have so it can fill you up. REAL RAMEN the “liquid” is a big deal and holds most of the flavor. They pretty much just eating regular pasta...for all that just buy some spaghetti 🙄😒
my “broke” ramen recipe:  pork, beef, or chicken ramen  add seasoning packet  add equal parts soy sauce & teriyaki sauce (of the thinner consistency)  add panda express packet of hot sauce or siracha to taste!  (can be eaten drained or with broth)
It’s salty? Instant ramen is a straight sodium bomb tf u talkin about
Yh cheetah girl we definitely get it that you like your ramen dry, desert dry🙄👀💀😂😂🤣
Is it just me or have i been eating ramen noodles wrong my whole life? Isnt there supposed to be soup when u make ramen
Cmon black folks......yall could of recorded something else then this laziness.....nobody is eating Ramon noodles like that
The outgoing camera bareilly tickle because half-sister quantitatively cure minus a materialistic help. mature, tricky crowd
Why are they eating it with a spoon??
Did these head asses say they like their Ramen dry??? Then thats pasta not ramen lol.
The ones that talk the most shit always has nasty food. Lol
Why did they give them spoons to eat the ramen?😂😂
“More shrimp”        DO YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE SHRIMP IS
Why are they eating dry ass ramen.....         WITH A SPOON
Y’all dumb ramen is soup
Why are the first 2 soooo dry?!
Never thought ramen would make me this depressed
What triggered me the most was them eating Ramen with that SPOON
I can tell yall arent poor bc your complaining about a struggle meal
Cheetah print girl needs to chill hers was the worse
I like how that one girl was looking for color in ramen… ITS RAMEN
Bruh I'll just throw some chili oil on it and we're good. Ain't no broke student throws some chicken or shrimp on ramen.
do college students not know what ramen is??😭😭😭 mfs asking why there’s broth in soup
It’s always the ones that talk the most that have the worst food on these shows 😂😭
Ive beeen a broke ass college student before but my ramen has SOUP/BROTH !!!!
Them 3rd one is the one I would trust cause its isn't dry and it actually a soup.
Olu noodles are ass,them thangs dry,chunky like why is it chunks
Wow these women are fine
Americans bare weird.... first off who tf uses a spoon to eat pasta let alone Ramen secondly all them shits was dry asf it's literally a broth based noodle dish wtf.... this video actually had me pressed lmfao this a hate crime towards Asian culture 💀
Im in high school and most people i know make bettsr noodles than these ik they broke but at least know how to make noodles
“It’s salty” BITCHHH RAMEN IS SALTY IN GENERAL
Why dont they like ramen with broth/water? tf
seriously tho all of these ramens looks kinda sad 😭🙈
Poor kids don't understand ramen is a soup haha
It is fucking ramen! Of course it will have water lmfao! The juice the best part tf!
Idk what that was, but that was definitely not Nigerian Indomie!!!
There is no way you can mess up ramen like the only way is it being dry asf 😂
Why is cheetah taking so much...I’m calling prolly the worst
WHAT IS REMEN
Fun fact This is just ramen. you eat when you're broke or too hungry to wait for a better food you don't get to be picky. unless you are an asian since they make ramens in maaaany ways and its their usual food i guess
All their ramen look disgusting, I rather just eat it how it is. God damn!!!
That’s a wierd title to have nothing but black people in it.....
Maybe I’m weird, but was I the only one who made ramen spaghetti??
Well ramen is an Asian dish so I knew that Cheyenne would do well because she used like oyster sauce and siracha, which are Asian ingredients you know. So it doesn’t take much to have it taste really good and standard.
The girl with cheetah print really got me mad, like your ramen was in clumps and looked disgusting and was dry ass hell but you’re trying to come for everyone els, like ramen Is supposed to be watery. And let’s not forget this video clearly says “broke college kids” so clearly these meals weren’t gonna be 5 star restaurant worthy
Traditionally, Ramen comes and is served with broth. 🤦🏻‍♂️ notice how the least Judgemental one, won.
Ramen with no soup.. aight.
Cheetah girl really presented a bowl of LEGO’s after sayin all she had 2 say.🤣🤣🤣
You were broke and u r adding prawns in here.I am not broke but still cant afford prawns for my ramen😒
The attitude stinks lmao
Worst ramen I’ve ever seen
FANCY RAMEN: Nigga: look it’s a clump 😂😂
Girl who hurt you? Damn.. (Yes Afro)
I think they have never eaten ramen the right way before lmao
Who tf gave them a spoon to eat ramen
Eating it with a spoon???
If I could mix Marcus & Cheyennes ramen recipes together that would be bomb 😭 I need the soup but I also need my lime and seasonings
"Not enough shrimp"? You're supposed to be broke
why does cheetah print girl care about the color? this is food miss girl
my biggest issue is that they’re eating it with a spoon, why y’all do that to them?
The Asian in me is crying 🥲🥲🥲
I HATE DRY NOODS 🥢 🤣
why are they eating it with a SPOON
... they Americans for sure cause baby ramen is souppppp and homegirl who won said “pho”
girl it ain’t ‘water’ it’s *broth*      👀
if u don’t like the juice in yo ramen get the fuck away from me
cheap, dry ramen is trash
Is they eating them noodles with a spoon 😭
It's suppose to be wet. The 1st 2 are not from this world making dry Ramen
Its ramen. Its meant to be soupy. Its a soup. And what’s with the going fancy on ramen. Its a late night snack when the dining halls and restaurants are closed. Not meant to be a gourmet meal. Heat the water and noodles up, add the seasoning packet, mix and eat. These college kids are fancy
Everyone talking about the girl with the cheetah print but im just thinking WHO EATS RAMEN WITH A SPOON YOU EAT IT WITH EITHER CHOPSTICKS OR A FORK IF YOUR LAZY
Shrimp in ramen yall ain't that broke 😂😂
Why is the cheetah girl giving them such low rates and she’s talking like those bully girls in the movies
Bruh get a broke asion
Wait do people actually eat ramen without the soup??
The cheetah print girl complain too much. She kept pissing me off
Hold up y’all eating ramen with a spoon???
Girl doesn’t even boil her soup or nothing she straight eats it out the package
Omg they don’t leave the broth in the ramen you should always leave the broth in otherwise it’s super slimy and disgusting
Isnt ramen a soup????? Who are these dumb people???
Man my Ramen will kill everyone's shit
Cheetah print girl was annoying the whole time and then she topped it off by saying “shrimps”.
People who eat ramen noddle soup and cook to to where there’s no more soup are animals
Shout out Bridgeport
LOL! Did Cheetah girl even COOK her ramen?!
Cheyenne kind of looks and sounds like Porscha Williams for ATL Housewives
ramen served with a spoon lolol
*talks shit about the watery ramen* *Takes a bite*  *Realizes they shoulda kept they mouth shut*
when i read the title i tought it was gonna be real ramen, but apparently, for them just noodles and some chicken pieces are enough to be called ramen
Why is she talking about color
Y’all braggin bout your struggle meals 😂
It’s always the person who talks the most shit that is the worse in these
“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry”  OH WE KNOWW!
Cheyenne if you’re in the comments, are you from CT?!? I live right by UB! Congratulations on your graduation! :)
Ok but why are they eating with a spoon 🤔
No 3 perfect amount of broth for me, i let mine sit in water for a few mins to get all the starch off before cooking, an cook halfway drain some water then add seasoning an cook for another few mins. I used to like grated parm on my chicken ramen.
Ramen is a goddamn noodle soup
the curly hair made me mad because her hair had good texture but her hair had texture like cardboard😂😂
They ain’t have to violate them in the title😭
Ramen is a soup it’s not a pasta dish it’s a soup it’s not suppose to be dry
Can we talk about Cheyenne and how she looks and TALKS! like Porsha Williams from Real Housewives of Atlanta??? Her smile resembles all the way!
Bruh she said its too salty u trying to kill me, 2 seconds later. It HAs nO fLaVoR
Owa owa talking so much crap but hers was dryy ash-
Im offended at who took Ramen and gave it to Westerners. Even Ramen is offended.
“ I bought my remen “ 😐
Have they never been to a real ramen restaurant??? Lol I forgot they’re “broke.” Give them some time.
I just got to say that these college students have to be extra broke to eat Ramen with a spoon and no broth just pure dry noodles
Please o, most nigerian ramen is actually good, and we don't like dry food, so I don't know what happened to her's
When #1 said lawry's seasoning salt I said oh no baby 🤦🏾‍♀️ it’s gonna be too salty 😂. #2 sis you taking MAD STUFF!  #3 dang I thought that you would have had it.   Y’all need a bag of frozen vegetables, some butter and garlic powder always get the chicken flavor or you could go for the Oriental flavor little to no water and  leave them mugs LONG WE WANT THE SLUP! BOOM! Ramen, love an 80’s baby. ♥️
Cheetah bitch was rude for what 💀
I l’d rated do veggie broth and some vegetables. Dats it lol 😂
They doing too much, also how are they not gonna have a soft boiled egg in any of them?
Yall need to try my friends Ramen Shes adds eggs to it 😂😅
curly hair pisses me off
at this point I’m convinced that the “ people try other people’s cooking” videos y’all make one person the hater...but then they food be the worst😭😭😭😭
What do they mean it's "watery?"  🗣Ramen is a soup....😩
Lol ramen is a soup I can’t with them 😂
Idk and idc how the last girls tasted! Hers was the best!!!!!! It’s not supposed to be dry! It’s supposed to have juice!!! I really can’t believe they make noodles this way.
Chose 3 black kids and put a broke title smh
Where’s the JUICE?!???!
I can’t with these dry noodles!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used to eat noodles everyday, and still will make a pack here and there. I CANT do no dry noodles. They tweakin! All I add is the sauce packet, garlic powder, black pepper, and a lil hot sauce.
None of they shit have enough juice wtf
Ok but am I the only person who thinks eating ramen with a spoon is weird
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER!
Am I the only one that just boil the stuff in the pot, pour in the bowl then eat?
Fur ball what you doin witch ur bread crumbs and cheese itz
1st of all...ramen is supposed to be wet and the curly haired girl talked like if she was on top chef-
They ramen was so dry you might as well eat it right out the package
Wow
Why is it in these types of videos the person who always talks the most shit always has the worst food.
Olu thinks she’s the best cook yet her food was dry and disgusting, she out here judging like a professional chef when she can’t even make ramen LMAO I know damn well she got pressed and disliked this video
The girl in Cheetah print top said the first ramen was too salty and theeeeen, complained that the only thing that has taste in it was the chicken. I'm confused.
do they not eat their ramen with a broth? 😭
Did they just complain about the ramen SOUP  having juices 😐.
Where’s the broth??? All their ramens were DRYYYY😭
What the fuck was that second one
Why are they eating it with a spoon....
Ramen is suppose to be soupy and broke students will not have money for extra meat products lol.
I'm Nigerian and yoruba and I can assure you we don't cook ramen like that. Although we don't have a lot of options we mostly have Indomie noodles but we don't cook it like that here so.....
whys marcus hair so damn fine
it ALWAYS be the ones that are the most "critical" but have the worst food. I'm sure this was a humbling experience for them lol
Dose any body want to just to the curly👩🤛
this isn't even ramen anymore, like wtf, it's jus "instant  DRY noodles" at this point
its always the ppl that cant cook that be talking the most fgjdks
How she say Marcus ramen was salty, then said the only thing with flavor is the chicken, it’s ramen seasoning the ramen it matters... 🤔😂🤦🏽‍♂️
“If you openly say, “Jesus is Lord” and believe in your heart that God raised him from death, you will be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬ ‭ERV‬‬
I was a "broke college kid" once...and my ass never ate ramen.
The girl with curly hair need to go... like get out Fr 😐
i wish we could see the other people's reactions that didn't win
At least WIN if ur gonna talk so much shit.
She says it’s salty then says “season the ramen!”. make it make sense.
IT'S ALWAYS the person with the most talk that has the worst meal.
Buddy boy over there learned not to judge a book by its cover
I like how the first girl was being all goofy headed satin on the other plates and than when hers came along she got a 2 out of 20 ahahaha. Stay humble at least you have your cool near major...
Nigerians? She did y’all bogus😭😭🤦🏽‍♂️
Add seasoning, lemon juice, tapatio, & slightly crunched up hot cheetos 🔥
Sis disappointed all Nigerians 😔. Who puts crayfish in ramen and ramen look like bricks
You must be real broke if you can't afford the water for the soup
Where the hell is the broth
I didn’t know ppl were out here eating dry ass ramen I could neva! Lol I need a lil juice in mine and they kept saying the juicy one was watery lol ... what!
So nobody eats ramen with the soup???
literally i can make it slightly better by making broth out of the mushroom flavored packet and canned mushrooms(~50 cents) soft boiled egg (dozen eggs is lets say 1.20 on average in pa, so 10 cent per egg),  and quarter of a chicken breast( chicken is usually 3/lb so it would be like 75 cents for 4oz chicken)
There water in it -_- ITS RAMEN
formula for knowing who lost = who ever is the most obnoxious
Who doesn’t like broth in their Ramen
"maroochen...
It’s always the one that talks the most shit😂😂
Automatic SUBSCRIBE!!✊🏾
Lmfao why did all of there ramen look dry af.  Ramen is a soup people!! My mama just poached an egg in the the ramen as it cooks then you just add some extra seasoning and bam you have a whole meal for less then 2 dollars, cuz that is a true struggle meal. Its so good cuz the egg soaks up all that flavor!!
They really find people with egos bigger than the fucking universe. No chance I could be in the same room as the girly hair chick for longer than 30 seconds
I know I’m the ramen queen but doesn’t everyone know we call that broth? They saying it’s watery and she still won.
RAMEN IS SOUP! It's broth not water. You're not supposed to drain it.
I don’t know how people go wrong with ramen 🤯
Cheyenne came in with the best attitude, I fw her whole vibe— I’m glad mami won 💖
So we not go talk about the fact that the cheetah print girl said  its to salty and then said season it😂
put hot sauce cheese and bacon bits in
I vote Cheyenne too, that’s how you make another version of broke peoples ramen.
Looking at their dry noodles had me wondering whether I was making my ramen right 💀
Did she just complain the ramen was salty ?
Why they all black? Only black college students are broke?
Side note... I love their hairstyles!! So cute
“Omg it’s so salty are u tryna kill me?!”  “Like fr the only thing that has flavor in this is the chicken”
Wtf did the cheetah gurl made
>_< omg its wet  -_- bruh ramen is a soup. duh its wet.  Also stay humble kids. With your dry weird ass seasond ramen.
The way she said ramen
yo who gave them a spoon for noodles
They're all privalaged,spoiled and ignorant asf🤔 millienials
Who tf wants to eat dry ramen...? The last one was the only one with any broth, i'm confused.
Ramen is such a personal meal that you can really curtail to your liking
I put parsley, black pepper, soy sauce and hot sauce in my ramen. Beef flavored ramen too
EATING RAMEN WITH A SPOON IS A CRIME
Cheetah print adding all that spice and forgot to add water.
“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry” *Has the driest ramen*
Y'all eat ramen with a spoon??!?!?!?
Have they never had ramen before last one looked watery what you mean it's fucking ramen not ramen noodles on it own
Lmao complaining about cheese and noodles it's basically Mac n cheese
Lol “ I like my ramen a little dry”. DRYY?
Who eats ramen with a spoon?
Did the cheeta print girl cry over salt
Feels like Cocoa Butter making one person read a script and be rude.
Clowns
5:37 yeah we could tell 😭
I like chicken flavored Maruchan ramen with soy sauce, an egg, fish/chicken if have any, and seasoning like pepper and stuff idk.  Also I keep the broth!!! Idk it just tastes better to me like that.

“My mom is spanish.” Is she adopted or something??
The brokest people are always the most chillest and funniest
Your idiots

Ramen gets dry when it sits so .....
Parking. Lol. I was taking the bus.
The thumbnail 🤣
It’s wet. Because. It’s. A. Soup. Ramen. Isn’t supposed to be dry. She’s like one of those people that dumps the flavor packet onto the dry ramen square and eats it like that 😂
As a Nigerian I feel ashamed
but ramen won't really be good if you cooked it hours ago and then eat it. it looks cold af
Hold up cheeta girl said the first bowl of ramen was too salty and then went ahead calling it unseasoned? 🤡
BYE “BROKE COLLEGE KID”
It's always the ones who talk about don't know crap🤣🤣
Im kinda confused, isnt ramen supposed to be a noodle soup? Why are they so surprised about the water 😭
What I learned from these series is the more shit you talk the more shittier your food will be
i love how these people are always so confident and then their stuff gets hated on by the other contestants LOL
Why the hell they using spoons
Guys guess what.      There is water in ramen.
"I like it more dry" tf? Ramen is only real ramen if you got the broth with it.
Okay am nigerian. Did that cheetah girl just say CRAYFISH in ramen. Oh hell nah. I pass. 🤮🤢🤮
'there's not enough shrimp'  Sweetie we're broke
Isn’t there supposed to be liquid in ramen? Dry ramen sounds disgusting.
It’s all about ramen with avocados and salsa
Nigerian ramen does not look like that lol
Ngl all of them looked bad like- why they so dryyyy? at least that one girl put some broth in there.
That’s not even ramen that’s noodles
That olu raged me so much her ramen look crusty dude
Cheetah print girl: Complains about the Ramen being too salty, even says the words "Are you trying to kill me?"  Same Cheetah girl after a few minutes: "sEaSon YoUr RAmeN"
My question is how tf they get through life eating that dry ass ramen oh baby nah y’all need to just follow the back instructions😭 but the last girl was good
She'll be more humble next time I bet  But hold up how can wet noodles be nasty?? IT'S SOUP‼ Huh???   I can't
“not enough shrimp” bold of you to assume broke college students would afford shrimp
Why does their ramen look like that 😭😭😭 all of them look gross
Seeing dry ramen felt illegal... like the fact there is no sauce or soup or ANYTHING just feels wrong
Olu gets on my damn nerves.💀
Why does ramen have to have color?
*cries in oodles & noodles*
why was the girl who talked all that sh*t ramen looking all chunky.... :X I cannot.
WHERE is the broth part one! And I know ya'll could have grabbed some onion, red pepper flakes, some cheese, ketchup, some something!? Shoot I've even added a little beer to my broth and it slapped! I know I been out of college for a minute but...
All they shit is their dry or mushy... this whole episode pissed me off.
It's clear that the guy and the African girl never had authentic Ramen....."it's water in it"......🤔😕 you mean the SOUP BROTH...😕😕
A SPOON?
“There’s not enough shrimp” tf you broke lmaoo
why tf woud you give people a spoon to eat ramen with?
Even the winner had a lot of criticism with their dish.  What kind of contest is this?
I don't understand how they all, even with some good points, messed up ramen?
Bro they are judging her for having broth in her ramen?????? Bro Popeyes BISCUITS ARE LESS DRY THAN THEIR RAMEN 😤
Why are they eating ramen with a SPOON?
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Cheyenne’s look so gooddddd!!
Why the girl in cheetah print talk like she’s reading a script 😭
Who tf eats dry ramen,like the broth is the best part🤦‍♂️
Sooooo nobody gonna ask why they are eating Ramen with a spoon?
i think the main problem was that they had to make the ramen from home so it got all nasty before they got to try it :P
“It’s watery”, fam Ramen is a soup. In authentic Ramen, it’s all about the broth.
I don't know.. if you have money to buy the chicken and shrimp then your not broke LOL. The spoon probably threw off the flavor because whyyy, forks people forks.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates♦️
The third girl is the only one who made it right. Everyone else made dry, clumpy noodles.
out of all the videos, i thought this bunch would be the nicest rivals because of the broke student connection, but they're meaaaan (except the sister in the braids)
y’all doing a lot over some ramen...
They ramen look nasty
Nigerian talked so much shit Nd lost 😂
Ramen is supposed to have the broth tho
That girl with the fro is the type of girl that walks into the class with the loud ass steps and loud ass water flask just to try and tell everyone she ain’t from the states
Girl lmaooo all y’all’s ramen look nasty
shawty said that it was salty but it needed to be more seasoned.. please make it make sense
they really violated them with the title
she came out the gates representing nigerians. im sry nigerians  but also theres so much you can do with ramen for anyone who's making ramen - if you want dry - you can stir it with some oil or crisp it like yakisoba. all 3 needed some color - add like bok choy or carrots or green onions or sesame seeds and an egg - if you broke getting shrimp aint the call loll. if you dont want soupy and salty - you can do creamy with like cream of mushroom. it really is just pasta
AND DONT NOBODY WANT NO DRY ASS NOODLES
😭😭y’all pick the Boujee kids
Okay but side note doesn't Cheyenne look like Porsha Williams from The Real Housewives
Cheyenne is a ray of sunshine here
What kind of ramen was I eating...since when there was a white ramen LOL
Cheetah girl the type of shawty that wants the world n can’t even fkin cook ramen😂😂😂
Is no one going to talk about how she just said “it gives me Spanish vibes and my mom Spanish” wtf😭😐
I liked the video but i wanna dis like just to get it to 250 i hate odd numbers
Damn. Nigga said "Its a clump." Embarrassing cheetah print.
"Its too salty" ITS RAMEN. IT IS GONNA BE SALTY
Who tf eat dry ramen?🤦🏾
It’s not about flavor, it’s about survival tf 😂
I've never seen anybody eat noodles with a spoon, also the 2 first humans ramen looks hella nasty :/
why are they all black
😂 "I like mine a little dry" girl. We know.
funny how Ramen is a complement to soup
her i like my ramen dry  me i know
Legit just add a egg or 2 and maybe some cirlntra
Damn people are rude as hell. I'm not sure if they're told to talk shit, but still.
First off hold up. It’s soup. When has soup every been dry. I’m so confused on why these ppl never had it the simple right way that the instructions tell you to make it 🤦🏽‍♀️ Clearly the only one was the girl who added shrimp.
I wonder what these people would say if they actually went to a ramen restaurant, would they send it back for being too watery?  Do they know what ramen is?  Do they think it's spaghetti?
Bruh they all black.....
Where is the broth??
We knew this was coming
I feel like this one was also hard because ramen doesn't last very long because the Noddles continue to soak and whatnot and idk
we all know that last ramen was bussin and they lied to try and win
where are my hispanics cuz ik they b makin the best ramen
I read the title as  "college students try out each other's racism" for some reason
My ramen with no ingredients is better
He really sat there and judged the soup for being soup 😭 make it make sense
How I sign up for this
“I would prefer my ramen dry” we can tell 😐
They should have got me to make ramen
ain’t no broke white college kids?
African goddess? Yea no
Why they got spoon
Olumayowa cooked ramen like most Nigerians would. Dry!
Cheta print noodles so dry they clump as a meat ball girl goodbye😭
The fact this only has over 200 dislikes is astounding to me. If expect them to atleast be on par with the likes. Idk how the hell any of these three kids got into college, yall need to go back to elementary school cause yall obviously never learned what soup is
Can we also do PROJECT KIDS try each other Ramen noodles next.Yall broke because school  we broke cuz of life.
Next time have a couple more contestants like 5 and if possible have them try Ramen that wasn't made by each other.Way to many egos and not a lot of honest assessments
I knew shorty doing all that talking had worst but all there noodles are over cooked
I know the third one was 🤤🤤🔥
why do i see no comments on them eating ramen w a spoon lol who does that ?
So... we're all here rn?
Im glad the 3rd girl win. How the hell in this world did the others 2 eat ramens 🤢
that girl with the afro has a massive ego
Water IS (traditionally) supposed to be in ramen. And the flavor is the broth.
I saw a comment posted a year ago suggesting this exact video literally yesterday and here it is😀😀😀😀
College is a scam you go in and you end up being  thousands of dollars in debt now your broke oh but don't worry as long as you work on your degree you'll be able to pay it off that on top of other bills and once you do get your degree just remember you might be overquilfid to work....
I wish we could see the curly headed girls reactions when the others ditched her ramen haha
“I like my ramen a little more dry” clearly 😂
Why spoons for pasta makes no sense 😕
Bro like just throw sun ramen in a bowl add water put in microwave 5 min take it out immediately stir it will water still in it till it dnt look dry or nun and have like a shine on it .drain yur water out throw the sauce packet on it mix . Now u done ain’t no reason y’all should be throwing sun damn shrimp and more Shii in sun 1 dollar noodles like wtf y’all on doin to much wit noodles. Respectfully quit cooking.
Now I want some RAMEN 🥴😂
Omg they complain alot
Why y’all broke lol. Just invest and flip stuff
It be the ones that talk the most crap lol
“The ramen is a bit watery” ITS SOUP. RAMEN IS SOUP. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT.
God the cheetah print girl was EMBARRASSING 😭😭
why did they give em only  a spoon to eat RAMEN wth?
are we going to ignore that theyre using a spoon???
How do I get on this I make the best ramen by far lol
all they ramen look nasty asf bye
Were they eating Ramen wit a spoon 🤔
This was funny!  But it makes me thing that young folk don't know nothing about real ramen!  JK
Real talk where is the broth how do you eat ramen all dry like that
Where’s the broth? Where’s the flavour?
they acting like ramen isn’t marketed as a soup 😭talking about some “it’s watery” i mean i would hope so 🧍🏽‍♀️
There's not enough shrimp. Bruh yall brokeass college students. The only shrimp you should be getting is that artifical shrmp flavor lmao. Shoutout to her though for actually cooking her ramen and seasoning it right lol.
at first i was excited to watch this to see if i could learn anything cause poverty food can still be good if done right but damn people really out here not knowing how to cook ramen at all. 😂 everything looked nasty.
cheetah print is a such a pick me
I ate this so much when I was a kid that by the time I got to college I hated it. 😂
What is Ramen to y’all because Ramen is supposed to have water in it not dry af
“A little bit more dry” 😂
Adding shrimp and chicken to broke student ramen? Huh.
That boy bms he picky ashell 🤣 OVERR RAMENNNNNNN
Ramen is a bit watery? Have you guys not heard of broth?
If u r broke y would dere be enough shrimp 🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Her: I prefer my ramen a little more dry Me: We could tell😂
Don’t be to overconfident luv....she didn’t even have color on hers😂
The girl who put shrimp in her noodle have taste plus her shit ain’t dru edited: dry
The girl shouting atagoongoon up and down. Should keep quiet, that is not close to how we make ramen in Nigeria. I would know cause I am Nigerian
I don’t trust people who don’t have water in their ramen. Which is why my pretty girl won 💖
3 was the closet to real ramen Lmaoooo
Noodles with a spoon?
6:26 let’s go boys
Alsoooo who said you gotta follow the instructions on the pack...recipes are just suggestions when it comes to cooking😏😏😂.....dry or soup, it’s all about the TASTEEE😛😛. Especially if you’re only making it for yourself, make it how you like it 😁🤞🏾🤞🏾   But I do feel bad for Olu....cuz them noodles😶SISS😂😶and this is why it never pays to be an asshole🤗
why is she talking smack about everyone’s ramen ITS RAMEN there is different varieties
Don't be picky if you're broke.
i can't believe this ppl eat ramen without water 😐 like, that's the whole point, its a soup???? without water and seasoning they are just noodles???😭😭😭😭
Everyone always thinks they make the best ramen .. I make the best noodles let’s debate lol
She going to make them change that thumbnail
This literally was scripted
I had a constant eye roll with the high horse cheetah chick. Lesson of the day, be a better person than her. :)
As a Nigerian girl i have never seen anyone use crayfish for ramen, but I have seen some use vegetable, onions, carrots, and even eggs, and delicious this Nigerian girl sef eh 😂😂😂🤣🤣
That upper class folks ramen 😂
ok but why they eating it with a spoon tho?
Do these guys even know what ramen is?? Bout  it’s watery 😂😂😂😂
💙💙💙🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
😳😳😳 why it ain't no juice in they noodles🙄 I'm judging y'all hard asf 🤣🤣🤣
This nigga just beat himself by giving shordie a high ass rating 😭😭😭😭
Why they give them a spoon and they could’ve left a little juice lol
Leopard Print girl be the type to judge you over the most inconsequential stuff and then feel smug about it.
None of their ramen was good
I hope she’s better at neurosurgery than at cooking cuz gurl...
welll i dont know about noone else but my ramen must have water .....
OOOOOOO I could’ve been on this!!!!!! My ramen really BOOOOOOMMMMMBBBBBB🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
“Sorry to that man”😭😭
If them noodles wasn’t freshly cooked the texture definitely would be off. If they sit they get dry and mushy.
Man my girl in the curly fro making Africans look bad rn😂
None of them know how to make stronies
Me being a real broke college student in Indonesia: bruh, eat them. Every ramen noodle is special
the first 2 aren't even ramen lollll where's the broth 😭
the spoon is the most troubling thing about this video
I hated all decisions that where made. They lost me when they bitched about broth.
Nah the title is killing me
the ramen that the cheetah print shirt girl made looked like she “cooked” with room temperature water... 😐
Young people are so hard to listen to
Why tf did they give them a spoon? How does that make sense😒
I knee exactly who was going to win as soon as I saw the contestants
the clump just chilling on the table 😩
name twinsies 💕
Girlllll there’s nothing Nigerian about that ramen plsss!! Don’t ever disgrace us like that again!
Is it just me who likes their noodles literally soaking in water like soup-ish ? like why are they all dry?! Is it really ramen if there's no liquid? idk man
Maruchan ramen or no ramen
How you broke and that stuck up
anybody else think they can make ramen way better than them like WHAT WAS THAT
No of them doing it right 😒
How is that cheetah print girl gone say her shit is gonna win then hers isn't cooked and its dry🤣🤣🤣
Where’s the broth.
That cheetah print girl annoying as fuck
How do I get interviewed lol😂
Why are they eating ramen with spoons???
>Broke Student Ramen >I threw some shrimp, some oyster sauce and some siracha
Curly haired girl is like "I CAN'T TASTE THE CINNAMON, I CANT TASTE THE NUTMEG WHERE IS THE FLAVOR?" lady
Why is it the always the one who talks the most getting smack?! And what is with them? Ramen is a noodle SOUP, its supposed to have a broth. Most noodles don't have "color" especially when using the cheaper ones. Basically Marcus thought he was making spaghetti and Olu...do you sis
“i would prefer my ramen dry” so thts why no one liked it the ramen was dry asf it look dry from the screen
I’m upset they’re shocked at the “wetness” 😂 it’s ramen. You can have broth.
She wanted to win so bad😭😭
Well if you say ramen, they do need to have broth in it but if you say instant noodles, there are some varieties that needed to be eaten dry like Samyang or Indomie. Not gonna lie between these three I like Cheyenne's just because it looks like something I'd eat on rainy days
Bruh cheetah print girl thinks she’s a the main character 💀
They fried her shit 😭😭😭😭...she really said fuck the instructions...like how’d she even get the noodles to be clumpy like that?  🤨
Who eats ramen with a spoon
she said it’s too salty then said nothing has flavor but the chicken lmaooo definetly lying to boost her score & failed miserably
That one girl with the cheetah top hair is so cute
why the hell they using a spoon?!
Cheetah girl thought this was going to be her acting breakout moment
All that dry ass ramen 😂
Ramen with eggs 🥚 in it is so goooood!
Ya'll ain't broke for real.. broke people can't afford protein (Shrimp? Chicken?). 😂  Holler at the real broke college students of the 90s
You should show all contestants reactions at the end by telling them what place they ranked 😂 that would be funny lol
Geez olu calm down
These people would hate actual authentic ramen 😭✋🏻
I’m sorry but it’s funny af to me that she said it to salty an then 2 seconds later sayin there not enough seasoning
Ramen is soup!!
Too watery?  Bruh, I don't understand.  How can be a soup too watery?  Pleas explain it.
I don't like people who are put food on their lips and be like uhuh it's nasty. Did your lips has tastebuds we don't know about?😑😑😑
All of you guy's not ready for Caribbean noodles that's how yall cook
Broke??
All of their ramen looked so dry and so flavourless damn they must be so broke
Why are they eating it with a spoon
Why'd they give them a spoon to eat it with😂😂
So nobody gonna talk about they eating ramen with a spoon?
Omg, chunky ramen.....like what
The difference in they’re majors lol
lol its called BROKE ramen lol be happy theres even seasoning and them 3 shrimps lol
Bruh all of their Ramen looks nasty. If i want it dry I'll eat it straight from the package and sprinkle the seasoning not after its wet🤮🤮  The broth is where the flavor is at the noodles absorbs it. On top of that the noodes looks cold yeah i can't eat that anymore the flavor and texture isn't the same to me🤮🤮🤮
I was always under the impression ramen is supposed to have at least *some* broth?🤔😬
No one put an egg or sesame oil in? Only one had broth? I would have destroyed this thing.
"it has water in it..which is okay I guess.."  It's like saying this cup of water is too watery. Ramen is supposed to be watery, it's a noodle soup dish!
Are they slow? ITS RAMEN its supposed to have "water" how they cook the noodles with juice bruh 💀💀💀
Cheetah shirt girl had a lot to say and still lost, damn that’s embarrassing 😂💀
broke college student: it needs more shrimp  (its the audacity for me. better be glad you didnt get just shrimp flavored packet lol)
Last girl definitely knew her flavor. Same thing I would’ve put on my noodles 💙💙😏
Bruh, Olu got fucking smoked
The African 1 was talking all typa shit and damn near didn’t even cook the shit😭😂
Idk about ya but none looked like broke college ramen. Where we gettin shrimp and all these seasonings? Middle of the night those are not it
Is anyone else bother by the tithe.
I personally dont get it. Wen I did eat ramen i ate it watery..its soup lol
bro why is their ramen dry? like bro add some vegetables and broth to that bitch💀
How u talk the most shit n lose💀
this made me cry
“My mom is Spanish” just by you saying Spanish I know that’s a lie
I have never seen lumpy noodles 😂🤣🤣😂 she went wrong when she woke up 😅😂🤣
How do you eat ramen with a spoon.....
I just watch these folks eat ramen with a spoon tf
No one:   Cheetah girl: RAHHMAN
When I was young and dumb I used to make mine dry. But when I became friends with someone from the culture who taught me the right way, it's no going back for me. Make mine with some soup!
its always the ones who talk smack that have the worst food
I’m the Ramen Slay Queen....I make it look and taste like it’s from a five star restaurant because that’s the only think I can cook.
Ramen is soup right?
Who wants to eat clumps of noodles
Why are they talking about it’s watery it’s soup it’s suppose to have broth duh college students
this s**t is racist as f**k of course they chose the black kids to be the "broke" ones in the video and I know the name of the channel is cocoa butter but that ain't fair
This is scripted because no Nigerian is cooking ramen or instant noodles the way Oluwamayowa made hers. Either that or she cannot cook.
Why they eating noodles with a 🥄 though 😂
Guys... RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WET lol 😂😂😂 it's literally a soup and broth is sooooo friggin' important to the dish! All these people just boiling and draining the noodles with no moisture left? Just... what? Lol Cheyenne had to win and she deserved it 🤷🏾‍♀️ everybody else made dry noodles and dumped other stuff on top lol.
Marcus is funny asfc 😂😂😂
When you don’t know what actual ramen is lol
Uh...look up ramen I guarantee it has broth only one person made ramen the others made noodles with seasoning and meat
Olu got what she deserved.
They cant cook yall only one knows how its soppose to be lol they should of did chilli noodle with chopped up sausage or hotdogs 👌 so good
Its crazy how olu was boastin so much 😭😭 and had the worst ramen 😭😭😭 that shit looked like undone rice crispy treats lmao and then she had the AUDACITY to say she should add her recipe to to cheyene noodles lmao
These are starting to sound scripted
All I was thinking about when they were trying the Nigerian girls ramen was glozell saying uhuhhhuhuhuh😭✋🏽
Black folks can y’all stick to basics like fried chicken? Leave the ramen to the Asians.
Leave it to the americans to not know how to eat ramen xD talking bout some "why is it watery" 🤦‍♂️
Its ALWAYS the one that talks the MOST shit. Im starting to think y’all planting them there. Cause aint no way fishy clumps thought she was doin it 😒🙄
Olu needs to go. shes so cheesy 🙄🤚
Ramen is soup. What the fuck???
Girl with the cheetah clothes and guy with glasses I wanna know where did you learn how to make Ramen or who taught you to make it like that bruh 😂 I can’t. I thought Ramen suppose to have soup with it???
Get asians to try this.
Olu is so pretty
Ramen does NOT travel well. They should've been able to make it on site and pour it in the bowl from the pot right there.
Cold ramen though!!!! Why cocoa butter!!! Don’t you guys have a small burner in your studio?
Oluwamayowa’s ramen should be illegal. That ramen was giving fresh out the pack… maybe a little damp but not cooked at all
I’m honestly concerned how many people actually think Ramen is supposed to be dry??? Like never mind the fact that some prefer it that way. That’s cool, everybody has their preference. Sometimes I like a good noodle stir fry too, But some people actually think ramen is supposed to cooked dry??? Pls, no— I promise you, if it’s cooked right, the broth is 🤌🏽✨
Cheetah girl don’t know how to cook, she said the only thing with flavor is the chicken but just before that she said it was salty dumb b don’t know nothing about flavor
it would say broke and they happen to be black okayyy🤦🏽‍♀️
Do this if you want tasteful ramen everytime without having to add anything extra. All you have to do is add the seasoning last over the noodles (make sure the water isn't covering them) and then leave it there for a minute or two. The noodles will soak up tbe seasoning so you taste it in every bite. Instead of just flavored water with bland noodles.
The ones that talk the most crap STAY having the most egregious food🤣
It's always the ones with the worst food out of everyone that are the most judgmental lol
They ramen look sad,I already knew who was finna lose. On another note though I would love to try Marcus’ ramen! And if you were wondering African ramen taste good I don’t know what that girl was doing!?!?!!!
I can't believe ppl eat dry ramen. It's a SOUP.
Dang, why are they adding so many things in the ramen😂😂 just spice it up with the satchet periodt
Girl had my hyped up for her ramen for so long for then to see availed abortion. 😭😭😭
Why does ramen need color. It’s 25 cents a packet 😭
Ramen is meant to be wet. If you complaining about the broth and you want to eat dry noodles.. eat chow-mein.
I just- “there’s no color” one it’s fucking ramen. And y’all -broke- what money you have to be adding COLOR to RAMEN? ANYWAYS
“Shut down the studioooo” 🤣
If she's a broke college student, how can she afford to add lots of shrimp to Ramen? Shrimp are not cheap. That was a silly criticism.
Why y’all got them eating noodles with a spoon
Bruh yall need to see my ramen
There is not supposed to be chunks in ramen I-😭
“im pretty sure mine will win.” “...this shit look dry as hell.” 😂
This whole video olu just annoyed me, F ur dead af noodles b 🥱
Please oh this is not Nigerian style noodles
Wow , I know some people who would have literally thrown down some good ramen !!!! 😭😭😭😭
It’s always the shit talkers that get the lowest score how ironic 💀🤦🏻‍♂️
How do people eat ramen with no water the fuck, like might as well call it chow mien
Lol the last one has my sisters name
Bro they chunks
Is this how broke people make cheap ramen
I just follow the instuctions
The one girl in cheetah print gotta go. She was talking about how she's Nigerian and how her ramen has spices others don't even know about and ended with a 2... bitch bye😭✋🏽. And then she was talking about how the first ramen was dry, but then it was watery on the last one🧍🏽
The girl with the cheetah print sounds like she hasn't missed a single vaccine on the schedule.
I like my ramen with milk... I am so sorry to the entire Asian community. 😔  What struggling college student has monies for chicken and shrimp? They boujee! Lol
this girl really said my name is omaiamou like tf this no anime shit
So y’all out here eating dry noodles 👁👄👁
In college my dad would put a piece of cheese on his ramen 🍜 sound pretty gross to me 🤢
Ramen too watery???!! It's a SOUP🍲
I WOULD END THEM ALL W MY RAMEN. WHY WASN'T I IN THE SHOW
well I just eat the ramen from the cup and survive.
cheetah print girl is so fucking annoying
Cheetah girl looks like she's reading something written on the ramen😰
Season the Roman black girl
They ate ramen noodles, WITH A SPOON. Lemme just eat my soup with a fork, then.
I could never, it’s a fucking soup SOUP BRUH. Seeing them complain about ramen having soup hurts my soul.
Def of ramen-quick-cooking noodles, typically served in a broth with meat and vegetables. But yes of course too WET and to much WATER
The cheetah girl is annoying
Who doesn’t like liquid in their ramen? It’s a noodle soup.
why are they eating ramen with a spoon
cheetah print was acting like it was supposed to be a five star meal LMAO just for her ramen to be literally CLUMPS
Ally talked the most shit but has the worst one LMAO😭
It be the ones that talk the most crap 💩😬 girl your ramen was crumps smh
You go Cheyenne
Damn they are even more harsh than the aunties and moms judging each others food lmao
I’m so confused do people not leave some of the water in their ramen? The point in to make a broth. Nobody wants to eat clumps of noodle
Why they complaining abt the water it’s RAMEN...that’s why they stuff looking the way it does (nasty)✋🏾😐
Cheyenne’s high😂
The grubby gruesome tendency neurophysiologically sound because wish extracellularly burn to a venomous ostrich. graceful, teeny-tiny kitty
Am I the only one confused? If you got chicken and shrimp and crayfish and shit to put in your Ramen, how broke were you really??? Mine just had hotdogs lol
Cheetah print girl acting like Goldie locs don’t know what she want smh
that’s odd that they are all African Americans it seems ....
I Would beat tf out the cheetah print gurl ngl
Olu needa stop hating 😂😂
The girl w the braided ponytail reminds me so much of porsha from Atlanta housewives lol 💜💜
not them eating ramen with spoons😭✋
I feel like Cheetah girl knew that the last dish deserved more than a 3 but she gave it that low score because she thought a higher score would decrease her chances of winning
tf she mean “it’s salty” what does she think is in the spice packet 😂
The Nigerian girl was overconfident but then again she's Nigerian
A true broke kid aint buying expensive ass shrimp lmao
all of their ramens looks like top ramen instant noodles , and top ramen sucks
these losers calling chey's ramen watery... it's a SOUP. i probably put twice that amount of liquid in mine but i use chicken or beef broth for that real fancy fancy
i don' know about u but srsly these people really don't know how to make good ramen, damnn
Always that one person who think they all that 🤦🏽‍♂️
anyone starting to think these are rigged? not exactly but in that there's always one person who acts unnecessarily rude and then.. they happen to make the worst one. i assume many of the poeple on these have seen this channel's vids and therefore should know that the rudest one gets a ton of backlash. is it just me?
"I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" no girl, yours is not a little bit dry 💀
all of their ramens look trash (im sorry but it's the truth), where are my korean ramen gang at?
The two first ain't no Ramen, thats some broke ass Tsukemen without side broth 💀 And to everyone saying that it tastes better without water, bull shit. That way it just tastes of straight up sodium and heart failure.  If anyone wanna know how to make Ramen with instant noodles, then this is my preferred method: 1. To a bowl, add the seasoning pack, the oil, some MSG and if you want, a bit of soy sauce (japanese or chinese don't really matter, just a little does the trick.) 2. Boil the water, more than you'd usually use, where doing this closer to the traditional way. 3. Add maybe a cup to a cup and a half of the boiling water into the bowl(small bowl half full). Yes where doing this before cooking the noodles, this way we don't get all that nasty starchy water. 4. If you want an egg, put that in, depending on your noodles, cook time may vary but total for the egg is 8 minutes so just add the noodles when the time remaining is right. 5. When the timer sounds, put the egg in a glass of cold water, dump the noodles in a strainer, run a bit of cold water through them to stop them from overcooking, no-one likes soggy noodles. 6. Shake off the noodles, transfer to the bowl being careful not to splash the broth everywhere. Peel the egg and cut lengthwise and put it on top. Add cut scallions if you want. And serve.  Itadakimasu. 🙏
6:27 she was already rude but this part just feels mean...
2:21 The BROTH MATTERS! WHAT RAMEN HAS NO BROTH??? Your ramen is as dry as a desert...
At the first five seconds I was about ta say aayyeee Nigerian represent but then I watched the whole video... she was talking some BS and I'm over here like oop nvm 😳
renem fucking remen!!
Lol cheetah print was a whole ass embarrassment.. always the people talking the most crap, criticizing and meanwhile their ramen is a whole dry clump😂
I still watched it but I think it doesn’t make sense to have people with a vested interest of winning score their competitors...usually one person be scoring everyone savagely low with them having the worst dish themselves it always freaking happens. Luckily this time that person didn’t win.
They know you are ment to keep the water right?
How you eat ramen without the broth 😂
I wish they were more variety or adventurous lol for broke college students
None of them know how to cook ramen Lmaooooo but ig they can get some points for creativity
“The ramen is watery”      Dude it’s a fucking soup
Ramen supposed to have "water" 🙄🙄
Wtf all of them was shit but they need to go to a restaurant and get real ramen !! Wat does watery mean ramen is a fucking soup it should contain water 🤨
how is it too salty but has no seasoning? My Naija Queen i need you to make sense. 😭🤍
Me: wondering how hard it's to make ramen  Me: Try's to make ramen 😎👨‍🚒🤦‍♂️🧨 Didn't set the house on fire lol haha😥
“It’s like a bowl of bread crumbs” I DIED lol 💀💀💀💀
That second one? Oh no sweetie that is not how you cook ramen... which I guess is fine.. cause she didn’t even cook it.
She had the nerve to hate on buddies ramen but her shit wasn’t even cooked. Lmao she trippin
It's Ramen, not spaghetti....where's the broth?
cheetah girl got too confident ayee
I don’t get it she said it’s salty then it’s not seasoned enough lol
RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOUP “water” they so dumb bye so glad she won
I can tell y’all my recipe on how I make my ramen noodles. It’s a Chinese hot oil inspired recipe.  Noodles:  I heat up water until it starts to boil and then I put the ramen noodles in only and I get rid of the seasoning packet because I don’t use it at all. I then let it cook for exactly 3 minutes and I drain out the water. This is to not have soggy noodles because I’m looking for almost like a chow mein texture.  Hot oil: I heat up oil (any oil other than olive oil) and I heat up a few spoonfulls of chili flakes (add more for more kick) I then add some pepper and some powdered ginger and some chicken seasoning. I then add half a spoonful of garlic. When that is finished cooking let it cool down and once it’s cooled I add a little bit of sesame oil.   Back to the noodles I place in a bowl and mix in a bit of soy sauce and oyster sauce. I then add the hot oil and I make sure I have the sesame oil added to it. Adjust any ingredients to your liking. Add chicken or shrimp if you like.  If you try this let me know what you think in the comments.
As a Nigerian who eats ramen on a daily bases I don’t know her
Who gave them a spoon- 💀
I'd either make a cheesy one, garlic one with egg mixed in, or ramen with a lil old bay on top
olu is soo annoying omg and she can’t cook for shit
Ah ofc they're black why wouldn't it be     "Broke"
Olu need to ollie tf outta here

Marcus was eating that Olu girl up 😭
Noodles aren’t supposed to be dry it’s supposed to have some water😂😂.... Lol
Olu is blowing me bruh
I’m from Louisiana so when I make ramen I put Tony’s or other spices in water or some other sauces and use it as a broth it’s actually really good but spicy as fuck and when I can I add crawfish or shrimp.
Bro ramen IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BROTH, litteraly what they r eating is “dry, stir fry” noodles  Edit: ty for all the likes:o
Nicee

These people trying to be pretentious about packaged ramen lmao
A half of sliced Kroger cheese, butter, packaged beef seasoning, and red hot hot sauce. That’s the way to go!
Yet u don’t got an Asian kid  elevating this
How the hell can they mess a ramen up If I were there I would win I make the best ramen Chicken Top ramen And a slice of butter in the bowl and 3 fried eggs on top and some chopped up hot links it’s so good you guys should try it💯🥶
Dry ramen is a crime. Also their ratings are all based on their own arrogance.
All the time the hater goes down
3:17 “ Look It’s A Clump “ 🤣🤣
She said “it has water in it...its ok i guess” isnt ramen a noodle soup dish😭😭

Cheyenne is so bright and her energy is contagious. Thank you for making my day better!
Bruh wtf why tf they eating ramen with a spoon????
I personally say everyone loss. The one thing that sets Ramen apart from noodles in a bowl IS THE BROTH
Put “instant ramen”. “RAMEN” is a different talk
Am i the only one in the comment section that likes Dry instant noodles 🥲
Am I missing something or does no one eat ramen like how it’s supposed to be eaten like... Yk with soup get the asians on this we make killer ramen 😌
Everyone talking about BROTH! As a student I've literally only had ramen with broth ONCE, most of us don't make it soupy 😂🤣
I would've won
AHHHH HELLLLLL NOOOO. “DRY RAMEN”. U shoulda chose some Asian ppl for this
Bridgeport stand up! 😭😂

They got to have planned everything they said

The second bowl did she even cook tha noodles omg smh!
Dam its just noodles not a gourmet meal
"I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry" girl, we know.
The real crime here is them eating noodles with a freaking spoon. lol.
Cheyenne was so humble and nice about the others ramens. I respect her and I'm glad she won. Also her name is so beautiful.
“I prefer my ramen... DRY” 🤔 HUHHHHHHHH  WHAAA— TFFFF

I prefer to eat noodles just like Marcus all the others are a NO go 🙅🏽‍♀️
Isn’t ramen supposed to have broth ?
I like my ramen with broth in it that’s what make it
All that shit look nasty! 😅 no matter how broke I am.. my ramen would never look that bad .. 🤣
#3 is the only one who cooked that ramen correct. Ramen needs it's broth people 😩
Crazy part is none of these niggas paid for there college education, they complained and used the race card for financial aid
the cheetah girl had me tight cause like why is you coming for everyone else’s noodles when yours ain’t even done yet it doesn’t cost that much to fully cook ramen😭 it’s not hard😭
Wait the first ramen the girl said the ramen was "salty", but the second clip she said that it needs more flavor huh?!?!
The stuck up ones always have the worst dishes 😭😭 .
...theres water in the ramen? Do yall mean the broth? Yall do know the broth is supposed to stay with the noodles...right?
I can’t stand cheetah girl
Idk, y’all are haters. Olu is confident and just funny as hell lol. She’s a bad b. Maybe she’s playing it up, and I don’t know why the comments section always has to go ham on these kinds of guests. She really wasn’t that bad. Loved all three of these guests though
That girl in the cheetah print, you can tell she is going to grow up to be one of THOSE African aunties that go criticizing everything about everyone else at the functions. Chineke, I pray for her.
Hahahaaaaaaaa how tf you mess up ramen! 😂
Why the guy hating so much on the other people’s ramen?
Yall running out of ideas🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a lot of people don't realise that Raman is supposed to be watery is not the noodles in ramen that are you supposed to enjoy it is the broth if there is no broth in it than it is not Raman
Probably the worst judges ever lol
any ramen without broth is not welcome in my house.
Ramen is suppose to have broth...I hope the generation z peeps know this
The way they dragged ms. Cheetah girl.  😂 “they went wrong by waking up”
“It’s wet!”  Well, ramen is usually a soup, so yeah.
alright yall pack it up this aint it
Sis you could’ve just brought indomie
You know that one girl with the clumps doesn’t know what ramen is especially since she said ruman like bruh there needs to be broth
did this bitch really say rAA -men
Ramen is a soup lmao! I eat ramen with a whole bunch of seasoned water😂 putting in some garlic powder, chicken broth, salt/pepper, and if I want it to be spicy pepperika(I can’t spell lmao) I also put veggies in mine

This show must be broke too.. using spoons to eat noodles. Lol
Follow the Ten Commandments, follow Jesus, and read Ephesians 4:29 please. Don’t fall into sin, fall into God’s grace and love willingly instead please.
What’s wrong with shawty? Terrible energy lol
Do yall eat ramen without the broth???????
I knew based off the way cheetah girl pronounced Ramen, she was bout to lose 🤣🤣
i aint even asian but shiiiiii im offended
Where are the forks?????
I like my ramen with a little juice in it.
Who eats dry Ramen? I'm so confused.
I’m genuinely confused. People eat DRY ramen???? Like excuse meeeeeeee.
Lmao i just drown mine in hot sauce and eat it with spam
None of them know how to make ramen 😂
When she said she prefers her ramen dry....  yea we know sis 😂😂😂
“It has water in it I prefer my ramen dry” sis ramen is soup
Do most people eat their ramen without the soup? That's the best part
Yo you gotta have  that ramen juice! That's how all the Asians brothas and sistas do it. I like to add some soy sauce, fish sauce and sesame oil, chili oil, green onions, purple onions and cheap ass whatever protein you can find in your cupboard (spam, egg, tuna, chicken...etc) 😅😋
They do know ramen tends to have broth right?
How tf she say it was to salty and then say it has no flavor 2 seconds later
Did he say it wasn’t enough shrimp IN PACK RAMEN ? You better be glad there’s some shrimp in there ! That’s luxury lmao.
I felt the disrespect for those ramen noodles
Cheetah clothes girl’s only personality trait is crayfish seasoning
Only thing i wanna know is...YALL PEOPLE EAT YALL RAMEN DRY ????!!!💀
These ain’t real ramen eatin people
Worst one had sooooo much to say
I wonder if any of these contestants have ever had a traditional bowl of ramen.
Shorty in print funny asl mine has taste  mines have flavor this is not it lmfao the other  two what are these clumps🤣
The way they’re calling soup watery.... wtf did no one read the label? What’s on the package??? Ramen noodle... SOUP! And this girl thought she’d win with raw ramen and some seasoning?
Y’all set the last Ramen had too much water but if you think about an actual Ramen restaurant they don’t drain under the water it comes in a bowl it was the Ramen soup and the juices from the soup part supposed to cling on to the noodles
I hope the other dude and Cheetah girl realize that ramen is supposed to have broth in it😭
If you not eating ramen as a soup you fuckin up fr
Y’all don’t be having water in the bowl? I can tell y’all not broke college students
WHO IS OUT HERE EATING DRY RAMEN??? WHO???? HOW did they complain about Cheyenne's ramen being too watery? Have these people had authentic ramen before? Do they know what ramen is????
who tf gave a spoon to eat FUCKIN NOODLES
Lmao, It’s always the most arrogant one who makes the worst🤣
The cheetah print girl reminds me of that one old lady with the worst potato pie while she complains about everyone's 💀
HOW THEY BROKE BUT EATING SHRIMP?  OLE GORL SAID ITS TOO SALTY, THEN SAID WHERE IS THE SEASONING ON THE NOODLES...  THIS VIDEO SO SCRIPTED
But why did she have chunks of ramen tho😂😂😂
I'm convinced I make the best noodles. If you wanna test that then come through
Ramen without the broth...🥴. Eating dry af ramen is a weird flex to me lol
Can we talk about how beautiful Cheyenne is? She deserved to win for sure
Nun of them  looked appetizing honestly
That ramen look dry asf it's a soup 😂
How are people this picky with food? Like how some people spit it out in other videos. Unless there was literal shit in something I would never have a reaction like that. If food is "good" to the person that made it, then there is no way it can be that bad.
bro why she eating ramen with a spoon????
No boiled egg in sight smh😤
1) I never knew people ate they’re ramen dry. I prefer mine with the broth. 2) If you’re going to eat ramen, but a little twist to it. All I ate was ramen towards the latter part of my time in college. I put onions, bell peppers, and sausages in it. if I got to struggle, i might as well have fun with it.
3:11 I cried so hard💀😭
Former inmates try each other's prison spreads? Make it happen
Why tf are they using spoons to eat noodles💀
Yall should make them judge their own food and act like it's some elses
Do y’all not leave a lil water in y’all noodles for juice
She said the ramen is watery 😭😭 miss girl it’s ramen is supposed to be soup!!
Ofc they’re all black.
The Nigerian girl was so annoying 🤣🤣🤣
where’s the broth?
at this point, i think that the pickiest person is a payed actor 👋🏻😭
She thought cus she put Nigerian seasoning that it was gone win 😭
at this point, i think that the pickiest person is a payed actor 👋🏻😭
The girl with the cheetah is a Karen in the making.
in everyones defense ramen doesn't travel well
WHY ARE YOU EATING IT WITH A SPOON?!
Whoever game them spoons to eat ramen deserves to eat cereal with chopsticks 🥢
Who in the world eat ramen with a spoon tho? 🤣🤣😭
What? Ramen is like soup why don’t they all have broth?!
How you complain about not enough shrimp in a broke student challenge?!
Why did I get the vibe they were acting the whole time lol. Just taste the ramen and talk like there’s no need to use your “acting skills” lol
I’d like to see southerners try each other’s grits. True southerners will critique tf outta grits
Nigerians can't cook for shit 🤣💔
“it tastes good” *proceeds to give her a score of 3*
Beef top ramen, Hoisan sauce, sweet soy, Chilii paste/(siracha)sauce,garlic, and ginger. Top w green onions You’re welcome
As an asian.... 👁👄👁  Wdym watery ramen??????? 🤣  We do have noodles that we eat without the soup. We boil the noodles and then drain the water, and then add the packet seasonings  We call it pancit canton HAHAHAHAHA  #Filipina
Ramen is a noodle soup tho.... the Asians are now confused lol.
Why is the title broke college Lmaoo
How is they using a spoon for ramen that has no soup in it just get a fork call it a day
there’s msg packets for a reason 😭
Yeah she sure do like her ramen dry🤣
The girl with the cheers shirt thought she was doin something jugding everyone else, literally her stuff was dry 🤦🏽‍♂️
Is nobody gonna talk about how they’re eating ramen with spoons?
AS CHEYENNE SHOULD WIN !
So we’re not gonna talk about how there eating noodles with a spoon😭✋🏽.......
who tf eats dry ramen💀💀💀💀
5:34 "I prefer mine dry" we know lol yours was dry and crunchy
She talking too much.
They all look so bland
I know everyone like things a certain way, I just wanna know why do people like they ramen without soup like its literally supposed to have soup lol
Do people know that ramen is supposed to have water in it. Ramen is asian soup.
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon???
"broke college kids" nah they violated lmao
Damn how do I get on this and finesse a meal?
"This ramen is kinda watery" ....yall do ramen is soup, right?
“Look it’s a clump” 😂😂😂😂😂
How you (cheetah shirt) gone say it’s salty then turn around & say it needs seasoning 🤔
Ramen is soup 🍜 there’s supposed to have liquid in it
I'll just eat my Ramen right out the package at this point.
She won because she's the only one who ACTUALLY MADE RAMEN. Ramen is a soup dish. The other two made chow mein if you're carribean or yakisoba if you're japanese. Fried dry noodles. The broth is what makes ramen. Da hell were they thinking?
It’s the fact that they got all black kids🙄
Eww who likes dry ramen?  Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. With egg,meat and some scallions or whatever you want to put in it. With the seasoning being a meat or fish based broth. You’re not supposed to eat ramen as is,it’s just pasta.
Why u gotta  type  broke like that
Cheyenne bad af😂
I am convinced you all purposely add someone who will talk creep about every and anything. Plus will have the worst dish on the line because there’s no way they are naturally this way
This foo said “maroochin” 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
it's just ramen
Ramen DRY !!?? Like your wig 🧐girlll‼️‼️
We know she like them dry noodles😂
The person who comes in last place always has the most to say.
I'm HOWLING at the rude, wanna be chef girls ramen reaction. 😂 Yooo it's ALWAYS the ones with all the mouth who come with the worst dish 😂😂😂
5:40 put it in subtitles
Three issues  1 where’s the water/soup part 2 why they using spoons  3 why they so shady 😭
Bro I don’t do all that I just cut the bag or cup open fill pot or cup with water, heat that bitch up wait 3 minutes, eat. That’s it. I mean hoo ray if you spice it up.
I like dry ramen but ma'am that may be a bit TOO dry 😅
What I get out of watching these videos is that no one is as good a cook as they think they are
Why is everyone upset about ramen with broth?! Its ramen! It is a soup, soup has broth!
Yo. Ramen is a noodle SOUP! Where's the broth? Where's the sliced meat? Or an egg? I been broke af and still can make ramen better than all 3 of them combined.
I'm sorry do people not eat water with their ramen anymore 😂😂😂🤔
5:38 “I would prefer my ramen little bit dry” *GURL YOU NEED TO LEARN THE DEFINITION OF DRY, CAUSE YOUR RAMEN WAS DRYER THAN THE SAHARA DESERT* 🌵
Ngl I like this channel.
"broke college kids" they're all black tf?
"Let me take another bite just a small one" precedes to take a chomp at it😂😂😂 @6:29
Hated the chick in the dots
Oh fuck no, all they shit so fucking dry💀💀
0:54 DONT LIE HUNNY STOP REPRESTING NIGERIA WITH THIS-
Man!!! when I was in college I’ll throw some butter in my noodles, Little packs of soy sauce from the Carry out . Cut up some hotdogs throw that In And bon appétit
@3:05  "My ramen is coming with a different vibe a different taste"    "😐 this stuff look dry as heck" 😂😂😂
Let me find out I’ve been making my ramen wrong 🤭 bc by the looks of the first 2 contestants, you just take it out the pack and put it in a bowl & crunch 😂
We knew it was gonna be bad when she ramen like that
She said I’d rather my ramen more dry......bitch we know 😂😂😂😂
Botched!!! Hahaha Ramen is a soup the whole point of it is the broth like if you ever go to a Japanese restaurant and they bring you dry clumpy ramen....run!!
Why they using a spoon lol
Idk why they are triggered by “watery” ramen. I mean most of ramen have soup😂. Only fried ones aren’t suppose to be soupy
cheetah girl really thought being hypocritical is a personality trait like-
4:33 SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE SHE GOT THAT TOP ITS SOOOO CUTEEEE
Everyone complaining about the lack of broth: If you read the packet it says to drain off the water. And personally I think the less water the more flavor 🤷🏽‍♀️ and if I’m feeling a lil extra I’ll add garlic salt and a scrambled egg lol
its the spoon for me
The girl who won Cheyenne is a straight up catch 10/10 in looks and personality ✨
I needa see the reactions when they told they lost not just the winner cause ik shordy was probably salty asl😂🤣like whattttt, there’s had moisture how could you!
Is that a spoon not  chop sticks not even a fork 🍴
How yall gonna be broke AND stuck up?? Like tf?? 😅
Quick question did they really sit up there and eat them noodles with a spoon?
I'm trying to understand why the ramen looked sooo dry? How did cook it? Without water? Maybe our culture is diff cuz the last girl was closest to how we do it
Yooo whose out here eating dry Ramen?!?!
she said the ramen had no seasoning then it has too much?
how she gone say its too salty and then say its no seasoning or flavor💀💀
Why in the world are they acting so stuck up and boooogie "not enough shrimp" "dry, but the shrimp saved it"... My guy.. dis a 3$ pack noodle recipe
Not y'al calling black kids broke-uhm chile
Why do they believe ramen is suppose to be dry? The package says noodle soup. 😒 I like mine with broth, chives, roast beef sandwich meat, and an egg. Like as close to real ramen. It soup not chow mein.
Y do they dump the water out
You find a bowl, aite? You break your ramen in half depending on how big the bowl is and then throw it in the bowl, you with me? Cool, then you add enough water till that shit floats or enough to cover it, might not always float. From there you throw it in a good powered microwave for exactly 3 minutes, take it out, add your seasoning, stir it up GOOD , then throw it back in the wave and let it marinate. DO NOT DUMP THE WATER OUT until AFTER you let it marinate, you gotta let the noodles absorb the juice. Personally, I never drained the water but if you're boujee like that and you don't wanna get your chin wet, go ahead. If you do decide to leave the water in, when you finish the noodles, you drink that shit... DON'T START WHAT YOU CAN'T FINISH! , okay cool. That's how you make ramen noodles.
"I would prefer my Ramen a little bit more dry." Yeah we know
Shout-out to my Nigerian Sista. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
So y'all ain't grill an onion and throw it in? Didn't add any garlic? No ground beef? Veggies or even pan fry it?  I'd kill this challenge if given the opportunity.
Ramen is supposed to have liquid though
from her style of clothes alone i knew he would lose and annoying af
there’s always that one hater 😂
Sorry to that man I don't know who that man is
If u want cheap but really really nice ramen get mama noodles
Wtf they gotta be broke 🙃
Video just started and I can already tell who made the worst ramen.
They were wrong by cooking. Period.  Marcus  😂😂😂😂😂😂
The lack of broth is disturbing.
This will probably sound gross but I usually use chicken ramen as a base and some low sodium soy sauce with an egg and mix it together. It's REALLY good ☺️
It has no broth! Whyyyyy?!?!
I don’t know any college student who seriously only eats ramen 😭
If u meals ramen in the microwave ur cancelled
Broke people making broke people food and judging other broke people food
Those first two looked dry as hell!! I was so glad to see sis had some sauce in hers.
Hmmmm they all have something in common🤦🏾‍♀️
The cheetah print girl just embarrassed herself
Can someone explain to me why people eat their ramen dry?
Who the hell eats ramen with only spoons?
Olu SHUT UP!!
The girl with the fro is pissing me off
I add butter (or when I was in college, margarine) in with the broth to make it more filling, and frozen peas. But beans and rice is much cheaper than ramen, so that's usually what I ate.
So the one in leopard print first said marcus meal was “too salty are you trynna kill me” then switched it to “it need more flavor” like uhhhhh bih which is it
Olu baby... pls stop. We’re all embarrassed for you 😕..
I add chicken broccoli and cheese on top
“I threw some shrimp in there “ *me seeing one shrimp on the top  of the ramen * 👁👄👁
So are we not gonna talk about them eating ramen with a spoon?
Not street ramen🤣😭
This upcoming generation has no creativity and it's also clear they don't know what ramen really is. Soup is SUPPOSED to have broth. Alot or a little is personal preference but it's supposed to be there.  We need a redo and I'd even throw my hat in the ring for this one.
someone called it and now it’s here! 🍜
Lol I'm just confused where's the broth, since it's soup
WHO TF LIKES DRY RAMEN????
Carl??? From Jimmy neutron?
Lmao who doesn’t like broth with their ramen wtf they didn’t have water on campus either?
why are they eating it with a spoon
Why are two of them eating with a spoon lmao
I’m confused like ramen is suppose to have the soup in it I felt weird looking at the dry noodles for the first 2 people like who wants to eat dry noodles ?
6:44 "it looks kinda dead" Says the one with a dry af brick-style ramen
I had a feeling the pickiest person food was going to be a flop. Where can I sign up to review food?
Why are they shocked about the water ? It’s normal to have water ! 😤😤😤😤
May 2020 college graduate here. From the jump I knew the nice girl would win because of the soy sauce and oyster sauce. If you wanna make your ramen have a great taste to it, put onion powder and garlic powder, easy dub for this challenge.
Girl with the braids is me asf I need texture and taste
Why are the all the people in the “Broke” video Black ?Whats That About
the girl in the cheetah prints gives me "pick me" vibes
Dude the way she says ramen pisses me off 😤
Swear I wish this was a broke culinary students ramen if I was there pork broth soft boiled egg tiny bit of ginger paste I’ve been broke but I know how to make a penny stretch with some weed but none of them know how to cook at tall
I would take the chicken ramen and cook it with some chopped carrots, celery, canned chicken, and bacon bits then after add some ranch and cheddar cheese to make bacon chicken ranch ramen noodles
it's clear that y'all don't know how to eat ramen correctly. ramen is supposed to have broth, which is what the packets are for. smh smh.
Why the most critical person always has the worst foods? I can understand if your food is fire but girl. She said his was too dry and too salty but without flavor and hers was full of clumps. LOL!
Dry ramen? Oh y'all broke broke, okay
Watching this while I eat my American cheese ramen with the liquid and black pepper.
This made me mad
I like how Olu was bashing on his ramen yet her ramen came in clumps 💀😭Ms girl 💀it wasn’t it
Congrats to all of u pursuing an education
Can they afford water? Cause why are theirs so dry where’s the juice💀😭
Stop eating top ramen and eat the Asian style noodles soup. Top ramen is nasty af, get you some noodles from chinatown or any Asian market.

Girl who talked the most shit got the worse one 😭 That shit look so dry and clumpy
“Reh-men” what
Why does there always have to be one contestant that I wanna smack in the face?
Notice how all the noodles have no broth ..👁👄👁
brih the girl said it was so salty then said the chicken had the most flavour and that the ramen needed seasoning wtf lol
Not the cray fish
Ramen is a soup it’s supposed to have water 😂 what are they talking abt
She deserved her win because her noodles actually looked done
Last time I checked, Ramen noodles normally has liquid in it. Its supposed to be a soup
Why is no one talking about why there Ramen Is so dry likes who like dry Ramen
you should put the part where you tell them their score, i want to see them humble themselves....
These some haters
Is nobody going to mention the fact they are eating Ramen with a spoon?
I wanted to see the cheetah girls reaction to her losing 😭😭😭
Can you do bakers try’s each other cheese cake
The girl that complained the most had clumps in her ramen, like come on my 7 year old sister at least knows how to boil water.
Why do they have spoons instead of forks lmaoooo
The racism there all black
I stir fry my ramen with veggies.
Omg!! You guys should try my noodle recipe   Get Chicken flavoured noodles (LARGE BOWL)!! Fill bowl with water make sure noodles are under the water ~~ put in 6:00 mins  take out obvi take a TINY bit of butter (to make creamy)  Add sliced cheese only a little (rip cheese into tiny slices) let everything MELT together then add hotsauce 🤤🤤
Olu gives Nigerians a bad rap. How are you going to be bougie eating Ramen??? Smh 😒
"This shit look dry asl"😂😂
I like my noodles firm but damn, not so firm I could use them like Lego blocks. Bet she cooks her rice like that too. Also, ramen is a soup not a noodle/pasta dish! Where's the broth? You don't need a lot but there should be some at least.
I always used to eat my ramen with the broth. Why do the other two have no broth? Have yall ever had REAL RAMEN? BROTH. NOT WATER TF.
It's always the ones that talk the most sh*t who lose LMAO
I didn't know eating Ramen dry was a thing 😳.
Girl automatically won when she busted out with the shrimp! Speaking of, how you a broke college student but you got enough money to buy shrimp?
THE CLUMPS!!! And she swore hers was the best i cannnttttt this always happens
Where does this channel find these people ? How can you complain about ramen being wet when it’s a fucking soup ..
RAMEN IS IN BROTH. YALL BE DRY AF. ASHY AF DIRTY AF  EW

Yo these dry ass noodles! I need broth in my ramen or some sort of sauce to coat it all
Bro said “She went wrong when she chose to wake up and cook”🤣💀
That second Ramen was a hot mess. the last one was the only one who made it right.
They’re really sitting here eating dry noodles with a spoon💀
Do they just not... eat ramen with broth or???
rAmen
THE BROTH IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE NOODLES! WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED!
Bro these people never cooked a day in their life before college 😂🤦🏽‍♂️ this was sad
Bruh it’s ramen tf you expect
People just fart in a bowl and call it ramen now days
A tsunami? Aint ramen a SOUP? Im confuseeeeee
my ramen: get the type that comes in a container--add hot water, seasoning packet, sriracha, two baybel cheeses, everything bagel seasoning and whatever veggies you like from the dining hall (meat if you want but im vegetarian)
"its so salty u trynna kill me?" bro that shits 70% salt no matter how you make it
OMG HAHAHAHA the CLUMPS LOL
my thing about the ramens was they wasn’t juicy to me i like a little juice to dip the noodles in ooowwweee — EDIT(alright baby with the “watery” ramen did it right. it’s ramen, it’s a soup, that’s broth! how she makes it is how i make it)
do more of these with college students!!!
Where the juice at
All three of them dishes is a zero. Had the audacity to call that ramen. Smh lol
U eat ramen ur dumb as fuck rice and beef/chicken will be your best friend in college
That’s why you gotta be humble on this show. You just never know
Is it just me or do all of their ramens look gross? I never saw ramen that dry in my life
Girl in the cheetah print EMBARRASSED herself oml 😭😭
Clearly nobody knows what the fuck ramen is. It's a SOUP DISH!! the fuckin broth is the most important part. I can't believe mfs still don't know how to make their shit
Ramen is not meant to be dry curly head boy and Nigerian girl rude that’s why you guys lose 😒
But wow ramen supposed to b a lil watery😂 why would I want them dry, sticky and hard
When they say “no offense” you already know there rude
Bru the title😂🤦🏾
The most blasphemous thing in this video is that they’re using a spoon to eat it.
“I would prefer my ramen a little more dry” GIRL WE KNOW
Ah yes racial correctness onky accepting black people. Fueling supremacists
If these college student ever get the chance to try real ramen, would they like it since 2 out of the 3 didn’t like wet ramen?
The girl in the black is so nice that’s how I would want my daughter to be
How are you broke but putting chicken and shrimp in your ramen??? I never understand trying to make ramen "fancy". If I'm eating ramen its by choice and I eat it how it comes. Also, why are the contestants always so rude on this channel. Like how about some balance in personalities.Not everyone needs to be so cocky or feisty.
Do they just pick the biggest jerks they can find?
The Nigerian one was like “at this moment I messed up” when she realized they were allowed use chicken
Damnn why we gotta be called broke tho 🤨
I saw broke....then every single one is black...
marcus looks like fcking cordae
HOW DO THEY NOT HAVE ANY BROTH??? BROTH IS ONE OF THE KEY PARTS 😭
I mixed my ramen noodles with Dinty Moore beef stew and ate it with crackers.
It’s everything for me
Lmao ik the girl talkin the most shit was gonna lose 💀
He said look it’s a clump 😥🤣🤣
yooooo where is the broth!?!
Where did it go wrong ? It’s everything for me yasss drag her sis
So basically they are all nasty
I ate noodles all my life. I would have won hands down
How y’all mess up ramen noodles??😭🤣 literally the easiest thing to cook but Jesus loves all repent for your sins ❤️🙏🏾
Yes to pronouncing your full name as it is sis & not using Americanized tongue 😂♥️
Why call them broke I hate the title
I would’ve loved to see the picky girls reaction when she lost.
Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE.

cheyenne is a very like able person i wanna be her friend
Call me when one of these people is stealing dinning court food to put in their ramen and eat later
The guy and the girl with braids remind me of my older siblings
Imagine being a 10cent ramen snob
Thank god that women in the leopard top got a 2, she started to annoy me before the video even started
they dead ass knew that if they brought an Asian in all other contestant would have lost lmao.
What do they mean the ramen got flooded.....dies... isn't it suppose to be soup?
Olu talked all that shit about spices and can’t cook a lick.
Cheese and ramen is fireee lol
Sorry, but it’s pronounced “RAYYYY MENN “ to me 😂
Not surprised that the juicy noodles won. Dry noodles are flavorless as hell. The water keeps the noodles saturated in seasoning.
Do they know ramen is a soup
Why is it dry? Why are they eating it with a spoon? So many questions 😭
I knew off top Olu joint was gonna be trash.
They got spoons
How are these broke college student ramen?! How can you afford the shrimp for more shrimp? 😂
cheetah print is cocky 😂😂
My guy Marcus has jokes. When he clapped before pushing the bowl away... 💀😂
They are complaining that that the 3rd ramen is wet.  Japanese: Do you take our food as a joke😏😏.  Ramen is supposed to have a broth its the actually close to real ramen actually. She even put shrimp 💖   what in the american ramen🤦🏻‍♀️
I didn’t know noodles could have a “vibe” 😭 you can very well tell she’s a naija girl
cheetah print girl is the black version of the Wendy’s white girl
My ramen be soupy as hell 😂 my add a few shrimp.  And egg. Cause noodles dry 😑🤢 or if I eat it dry I eat it with cheese and crackers lol
“my mom is spanish “ spanish is a language not a race 😐
Cheetah shirt: “Today I brought my Nigerian styled ramen”  Me: Excuse me? I must’ve misheard that last part, did you say that wannabe cereal was NIGERIAN😭?!!!
The Lmmfao headass 🤣😂😭💯
Where is the juice people it is ramon  noddles
My take from this video:  Don't put anything funky to the instan ramen. It taste good already.
Cheetah girl made herself look goofy lol
They were wrong by “waking up” 😂😂😂😂😂
Nigga who tf eats Ramen wit no broth??? Thats nit Ramen thats dry korram noodles
I always have a lot of broth in my ramen, I hate it dry lml
Omg I saw someone comment this in other video and it really happened 🤣🤣
I don't know how many people will see this comment but. I need help.      I'm graduating this year but I won't be able to pay my senior dues in time. I could really use some help. It costs 200 dollars and I currently have 50. If anybody could cash app me even a dollar it would be appreciated.  $hdaejon

YALL BROKE? BUT GOT CHICKEN N SHRIMP.!... HELL NAW
You know Cheetah Girl is thinking about suicide after reading these comments about her being a bad person.  Do cheetah girl, do it! Don't let us down😂😂😂

Olu should’ve known better to bring some clumpy ramen noodles on here 😂 over here talking about” need  color “girl it noodles it don’t need color 💀
Bro who would volunteer for this
What kind a title is this..
I thought it was normal to eat noodles with broth, at least it is in Korean cultures (who are known for their noodles🤔)
SO THEY REALLY EATING NOODLES WIT A SPOON😑😑
Bruh, Ramen is supposed to have broth, stop complaining.
They do know that for ramen the flavour is supposed to be in the broth? It ain’t pasta with sauce lol
cheyenne is a cutie ngl
How the noodles go from being salty to having no flavor? 😩
I need that leopard print shirt tho
"all the water" y'all WHERE? it's ramen and that's broth??
I Swear people that say the word "Vibe" or "Fire".  Are plain-ass retarded 😂😂💯💯💯🤡🤡
bro these kids dumb as fucc thinkin ramen not supposed to have broth
So college kids don’t actually know how to make ramen? “College” kids?  What happened to us?
they need to drop their recipes wtf !!!!
DO THEY NOT UNDERSTAND RAMEN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WATER ITS LIKE SOUP BUT WITH NOODLES
I’ve realized it’s always the ones who are narcissistic and aren’t humble who lose...
How are y’all making ramen wrong?! All of them look dry and the same 😂😂😂 they must be colorblind.
Who in the world eats dry Ramen? The soup or the broth is a crucial part of Ramen. Start adding veggies to your Ramen people
ight so i know everybody has at least one bullion cube. use that to cook the ramen in. Next I hella know kroger has rotessier chicken for like $3, shred some of last night's up and add to the noodles. Then you know frozen veggies can be had for like a dollar so also had some to the noodles when they cooking. As far as seasoning add in some red pepper flakes, chili powder, and garlic powder
I feel like they should have minimum 5 people for these kinds of series, just to make the judging more fair. I also wonder how hot or fresh the food is cause time can really change the texture and taste of a lot of foods. Ramen isn't that great once it's cold and all the liquid absorbs for example 😅
why do these people like dry ass ramen😭 if there's no soup like the last girls then im not touchin it🤣
They keep saying that there is water in the ramen. That's like calling soup water with noodles. SMH. How do you eat dry ramen? I respect their preference for dry noodles but they might as well just make any other pasta if they are going to eat it stiff and dry. The right person won.
Why didn’t anyone just make regular noodles they would have one😂😂
I like watery ramen 🤷🏾‍♀️
It’s not Ramen w/o broth lol.
clumpy ass no both ramen wtf
Easy, cheap ramen recipe I do at home.  1 ramen pack 1½ cup water Cheese of choice Egg Ranch powder Desired seasonings Bring water to a high boil in a small pot and place noodles in. Cook and stir occasionally for 3:00 minutes. On the side get a pan, spray with oil or butter and make a sunny side up. After 3 minute is up add your ramen packet into the pot and stir for 10-15 seconds or until noodles are well incorporated and shiny. Dump them into a bowl, add shredded cheese of choice, I prefer colby jack, add your egg on the on top and sprinkle ranch powder on top as a garnish. Enjoy!
We’re not talking about how they eating ramen with a spoon ??
The ramen that is the most like actual ramen is the winner...go figure...
That anagoogoo ain’t it 🤣
Oyster sauce and sriracha is how you make instant ramen just a little bit better, girl got it right
Awwwwwww. Marcus looks like a black Carl from Jimmy Neutron. Awww little cutie.
Yall domt leave the water in yo ramen?
What I wanna know is why the title says "broke" and they are all black.
Who the fuck eats ramen with a spoon 🙂
Cheetah print’s persona and her ramen matches each other they both stank 🥴. But she’s beautiful asl tho
Afro bih a brat
Who are these ppl not having liking ramen broth?? It's not spaghetti wth
are they okay...ramen is supposed to be a soup🧍🏽‍♀️
I’ve always just put hot sauce on mine
Its pronounced "raw-men" Not "Rae-man" @ the girl with the cheetah shirt. In Japan the r doesn't exist so its pronounced more like "dra- men."
If you can afford to put chicken or shrimp in your ramen..you're not broke
Wow, people with a good future.
They really just want yakisoba, they don’t want ramen soup, man complaining about watery soup tf
Y’all too broke but got chicken and shrimp in ya ramen that’s rich kid budget meals fuck out of here go to the real struggle towns ask bout they ramen 🔥🔥🔥🔥no meat just flavor
Do they not know that ramen is usually eaten in a broth? lol And Olu had some nerve talking cash money sh!t when she was bringing ramen nuggets 😭😩
Girl with the Braids ramen look goodddd idk what they talkin bout
If.....I am a broke college student you think I have a cabinet of seasoning + things to add to spice it up ?! 😭I'mma do what I can do with what I have and dig in 😂
the ramen looked liked her hair/
I put cheese and ranch into mine to make it more creamy
tbh all of these ramen looked kinda gross
Please learn what real authentic ramen is and then realize it’s SUPPOSED to have broth 🙄
If y’all want good ramen go to prison
All I need are dollar franks and that's good enough  (But I'm also fancy sometimes and fry it with some beef and dollar cheese
" the ramen is way to watery" 🤨 I mean it's ramen
Who eats ramen with a spoon? Maybe the broth, but not the noodles.
Where’s all the white people?
The person with the most mouth is always the loser 😂
Ok like this video made me question if I’m eating ramen right lol. I make mine a soup. You know... like ramen. These people be eating some wet dry noodles.
Like Raven in the third movie, Cheetah Girl has to go! -.-
Y'all do know that traditional ramen has broth right? It's not supposed to be dry. It's quite literally a type of soup.
The first girls name though!!!
“There not enough shrimp” THIER ON A BUDGET WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
heres mine: the rmane noodles obvs, cook them half way and drain a lil water. add half chicken seasoning, stir. and continue cooking till theyre still moist but not soaking. add a knob of butter, paprika, your scrambled eggs, garlic powder and s&p, stir and voila
Ramen is a soup, so where the broth at?
Who ever you are God and Jesus Christ loves you
Water is supposed to be in the ramen y’all it’s supposed to have a broth because it’s a soup

Cheyenne def made ramen like how it supposed to be made! All the others looks dry Af!
Do people not make SOUP out of their ramen? Who eats the noodles alone?
Y’all cannot complain about ramen if y’all “BROKE”
how ironic that the person thinks that their ramen is best ends up losing lol 😂
They should have gotten to cook it fresh!
LMBO at Olu
2nd lady had to cry after this😂
Ramon is suppose to have broth in it 🤨 fuck y'all talking bout?
She really tried to give her a 2 but ended up with a 2 😭 the irony
I would smoke them at making reman lol
I'm sorry but cheetah print girl yours wasn't even acceptable😩
Cheyenne is so pretty! I can’t get over her smile
Ramen is a damn soup it’s suppose to have liquid

The girl said “It’s salty “ then gonna say “It’s not seasoned “ 😂😂🤣🤣💀 like girl if you a little jealous just say that
Girl with the spanish mom is 🔥🔥🔥 I like her lol.
They out here acting like ramen is 5 star cuisine😂
How do white people put one black person in every movie and video and they don’t put one white dude?
This channel is racist

Ramen is a soup. Dry ramen isn't it but they don't seem to know.
Wait wait wait.. did she say RAMEN was salty???
These mafuqa making ramen dry as fuq!? ramen is a soup not spaghetti ya’ll
The fact that they didn’t like the wet ramen even though ramen IS A soup.
MAYOWA, HOW CAN YOU EMBARRASS NIGERIA LIKE THIS??😭😭😭😭😭
What they mean watery😂 it’s SOUP!😂😂

Cant go wrong with shrimp in ramen
Yo all these looked pretty bad, actually.  Lol
Wow.......ramen with a spoon
The dry ramen looked DISGUSTING!
Cup of Noodles preferably only because it has the veggies chopped in there, I don’t drain the water and I chop up some cabbage into small pieces squeeze some lemon maybe some tapitio hot sauce and shabammmmm 🍜🍜
“i don’t like all the water” ummm RAMEN IS SOUP. THE FUCK?
No veggies ?😯?
Olu is rude and annoying
It's always the ones that talk the most shit that has the worst dish
At this point I feel like these are actors, cause the plot line for these are ALWAYS THE SAME, same plot different people😂
Isn’t Ramen supposed to be watery 😭
my question is how are people THIS bad at ramen
Hey guys am I the only one who doesn’t drain the water out of the Ramen . I don’t like it dry it’s supposed to be soup right? I throw a boiled egg some chicken and a little broccoli, is this weird?
I hope young girl with the cheetah print looks at these comments and takes in these critics and also takes a break from her high horse
Where is the fried or boiled egg? Green onion? Cheese maybe? Sriracha?? Why is all their noodles so dry??
Why they eating ramen with a spoon my guy... put me on this I’m sure I would have won I come straight from the trenches 😂
They went off on the cheetah girl ramen
My noodles go crazy
Lmao I love Marcus personality
Do people on here know that ramen is a soup 🍜... It's not supposed to be dry 😅
the bitch w the afro saying its too salty r u trying to kill me and then said the only season was the chicken and to season the ramen smfh
Imagine being broke and needing to fill your stomach and not wanting any broth...make it make senseeee!
THEY GAVE THEM A SPOON FOR NOODLES 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would rather just boil water, cook the noodles and add the flavor packet...
‘It’s dry...” “I prefer mine more dry”
Cheetah Print Girl has to be a daddy’s girl, all I hear seeing her is “But daddyyyyyyyy😫”🙄
Uhhh ... ramen is supposed to be watery.
6:20 she said the water is a bit watery....uhm your were in clumps
dawg no shot yall eating with fuckin spoons
I'm still getting to figure out who tf eats Ramen with a spoon
Where’s the water?
-The title😂😂😂
Most irritating video ever
why did y’all give them SPOONS to eat noodles with lmao
"the ramen is watery" its supposed to be a soup???? i've never seen anyone eat dry ramen what are these people on 😭
Anyone else glad that Olu lost?
When you broke you learn how to eat it anyway aside from the taste.
And here I thought the best ramen was shrimp flavor with water sat for 2-3 minutes so it still retains a bit of body. Why are these people out here like this is a cooking show? The best ramen is one that knows that it was already good and needed nothing else.
This is stupid. 1st off Ramen is soup it usually HAS WATER  IN IT.  I personally like mine without  the water but I'm not going to act surprised if someone  has water in their ramen.  2. TF broke y'all  talking about it need more shrimp  or special  Nigerian spices  😑😑😑😑 that's  not broke ramen. Broke ramen is adding the $1 bag of broccoli from walmart and a can of chicken (2 for $1) from dollar tree 😒😒😒😒. It would be nice if y'all had for real broke college  kids up here making struggle meals and not these 3 that probably  think it's cute to call  themselves broke
Cheyenne not a hater the other one however she hating on everything
So since when did ramen having broth become wrong 🤔 I thought it was a soup
“Shut down the studioooooo” LMFAO 🤣
Umbrella head is annoying
Why they using a spoon
How they gonna say it’s watery.....it’s ramen -_- so soup not wet now ?
Bruh. Both cheeta and Marcus are terrible
How are these college kid and they don't know how to cook ramen i thought people who went to college are smart??? proves they're not
This olu girl fall my hand , who cooks ramen like that.
Tuff
None of these ramens look cooked, y’all know there’s supposed to be broth right?
The girl in the cheetah print said his food was salty then said he didn’t season his ramen, LIKE BABY.
The one that judges the most alwayd end up loosing
clumpy and chunky LMAO
She really said fucking “remen” what is remen?
He added Chicken?? That’s not broke... all I add is water, butter and hot sauce 😭😭😭😭
why the hell are they using spoons lmfaooo
always the neuroscience majors
OMG ALL THERE RAMEN LOOKS NASTY TBH 😭😭😭, except the one who won
All of their noodles look nasty who like dry noodles
Can I just point out that NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEYRE NOT EATING NOODLES WITH A FORK OR CHOPSTICKS.
I didn’t even know it was 6hours  ago 😭
It's salty but only the chicken has flavor 🤔🤔🤔
Do people really eat ramen with spoons?
Why they all look dryyyyy
Have y’all ever noticed the person who is always boosting their food up always loses? It’s never as fire as they think it is. Like the lady who put the liquor in the sweet potato pie and the Mac n cheese clip. Those two ladies really believed their food was it. All that talk and the food is trash. 😂🤣🤣🤣
it’s the eating with the spoon for me
Why are they all black
none of them know how to make ramen lol
These are the pickiest broke college students I have ever seen. It's RAMEN!!!! Its suppose to be "watery"
5:38 oh sis we know :/
Shit down the studiooss
Cheetah print girl out here embarassing herself🤡
OLU is a hater.... dry ass noodles
Please oh please how do you fucc up ramen🥴they not broke , The wealthy asf
I can confirm that is NOT Nigerian style ramen, that’s just her MESS
Complains about paying for parking as a broke college student... sis you got a car?!🤣
All they shit was weak as hell if we being real lol
One of the girls was talking bad about the other peoples ramen ,and then they gave her a 2 in all.😂😂😂
the title is fire
It’s bugging me how they are using spoons and not forks 😭
Why can't we ever get an episode where people don't just fucking dunk on each other and give actual scores
Just give me some Louisiana hot sauce on my ramen fuck all that other shit
Why on earth did you give them spoons?!🤔
Cheyenne the only one who knew ramen supposed to be soup 🙃
The last one with juice/broth is how ramen is supposed too be. I like too boil mine in a chicken or beef broth depending which in making and add thin cut chicken/sausage, tiny bit of cilantro into the chicken ramen, scallion, and sometimes a over medium egg with some hot sauce. 😋
I aint got time cuz my noodles is the best! Its simple add Soy sauce and a type of hot sauce (preferably siracha or Louisiana hot sauce) add a over medium egg and its a wrap. If i want to get fancy i eat it with lettuce or left over cabbage.
Boys: this isn’t that good I’ll give it a 6  Girls: this is really good I’ll give it a 6
Why are they even eating noodles with spoons 😭
Lmao it’s always the same the one that talks the most is the most delusional 🥰
Same thing happens every time hater annoys everyone  hater loses

the cheeta print girl and the guy need to go, they both couldn’t even add water😭 plus they were annoying
Isn’t ramen a soup? Why y’all bitch about water. Y’all eating dry noodles.
With the chicken flavored ramen 1 hotdog sliced like a coin then add 2 slices of American cheese 🧀 but before all of this drain the water.
S-spoon?
A minute in the video and I’m cringed 😬 on how ha ass just said Ramen 🍜 🤨

Ramen is supposed to have broth.

complaining about ramen having soup.. that's literally what ramen is
I have to have the broth in my noodles. Don't nobody want no ashy noodles. And green onions set it off for me in mine 😋
I could make miracles with ramen hmu 😂
Tbh only the watery one did it right 😭 the rest look like they’re eating the ramen noodles straight out the package.. why are they hard clumps?? 😭😭
At least change the title to "broke kids try each others mi goreng", cuz this ain't ramen, who tf eats dried ramen?
They keep saying it's watery omf. My man, it's the broth. You can eat your ramen however you want to but don't act like it's weird someone is preparing their ramen the right way.
Where the Asian people at?
AY WHAT'S CHEYENNE'S @ THOUGH?! 😍
Ramen is supposed to have broth almost like a soup so when you see dry ramen ... run
Garlic, onion, umami seasoning, and siracha. That’s all that is needed for a “gourmet” cheap ramen. And leave 3/4 of cooking liquid covering the noodles, it’s a soup...
All of these look gross asf lol
😂😂who tf pours out the water in the noodles????
Dude doesn't want to eat ramen he want to eat chow mein!! Ramen is soup!!!!
Cheetah girl: “I would prefer mine to be a little more dry”   Yea girl😳WE KNOW
I knew that chick that swore her ramen was the best was going to lose.
"I would prefer my ramen a little bit more dry.." Yes yes we all noticed....
The only thing that would make these type of video better will be a score review & reaction to all contestants
Umm why they eating ramen with a spoon💀💀💀
" I don't like water in my Ramen" Me: THEN DON'T EAT IT
Why eat with a spoon???
Don’t y’all have meal plans 😂
Them: This ramen is "too watery." Me: Ramen is soup though...I understand Ramyun or Indomie are usually dry but the packs y'all using is usually soup.
I prefer my ramen wet, noodles firm, seasoned with the packet and other salt free seasonings along with fresh spinach, serrano peppers and chicken, or sausage. That's my ramen recipe! All of these looked bland. Sorry🤷🏽

They all looked, and probably tasted, like shit. These people have no idea what they’re doing
y'all just be postin anything huh
damn so all thru shit was nasty
Best way to cook ramen packets;  Cook ramen(boil water or cook in microwave). When ramen is done, strain MOST of the water in the ramen, add butter and  1/2 seasoning. Mix well. Season strained broth to taste(use whatever seasoning you want + remaining seasoning packet). Add egg, meats, veggies. Pretty simple.
It's always the people with the cockiest attitudes that end up losing😂😭Humble yourselves pls💀
Damn i don't think ive ever seen a score that low💀😂
“theres a lot of water in here i prefer my ramen to be a little drier”  GIRL YOU LIKE CLUMPY MUSHY 2HOUR OLD DRY AS THE DESERT RAMEN STFU and ramen is supposed to have a little broth🤦🏻‍♀️
ik she watched this and got mad asf😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ramen is a soup!! What you mean it’s to wet??
Ok first she (the girl with the curly hair) said it was too salty then next she said it didn't have flavor. And why were they using spoons?
its just instant noodles all you do is boil it like calm down
Why is there always a picky person 😭😭😭😭😭
Honestly I cant even focus on what they're saying because I'm just sitting here baffled that Ramen is being eaten with a damn spoon.
Trust me if indomie was here, it would reign supreme for sure
Frs that first ramen looked good asf
This bitch really gave them ramen chunks and was talking about hers was the best😭
‘I prefer it a little more dry’ what like the Sahara desert? throw it all away.
Being broke in the navy is horrible, I eat lobster and steak almost all the time. They pancakes and eggs and bacon and it’s just not enough 😔
4:16 They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make it 🤣🤣🤣the knock out blow👉🏾: They went wrong by waking up and deciding to cook 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If they can add all those ingredients to a ramen, they can afford real pasta.
cant be serious
So how does everyone prefer their ramen? Water in it or dry
Remen just Love REMEN
y’all eat oodles ah noodles with a spoon ?
I mean isn’t ramen supposed to have water...but ok no hate...
SOMETHING YOU’D SEE ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET LMFAOOOO
So did they just pick people who have never had ramen before and tell them to make it
Js olu or w.e the lady’s name was ,is ignorant. I got some other things to say but ima juss leave it at that so no one gets mad
They would’ve been like wtf to my ramen lmao, my shit would’ve been red cause of 2x spicy sauce. 😭
Cheetah print talking bout she’d add her spices to give it color and flavor, nobody want that chunky ramen home girl 😂
Okay but why they eating ramen with spoons...
whew... saying all that just to have clumpy ramen.  & what’s wrong with y’all, giving them spoons for noodles wth
STFU!! 😂
https://youtu.be/DFWiB4bd2Mo
I was hoping the guy would win he was nice and I feel he rated the other constants fairly. The girl with the braids won because she added shrimp... and lastly why they eating noodles with a spoon??? After seeing how some of their noodles was dry I understood.
Cheetah shirt girl cannot cook. I bet when she boils water, she over do it. My 8 year old daughter can make ramen noodles better than her.
Nahhhhh in my opinion, ramen is suppose to be eaten as a soup ! Not dry noodles ! Unless you call it stir fry ramen noodles .  Y’all don’t know anything about ramen. 🤦🏽‍♀️ atleast the other girl with the black shirt got it somewhat right lol hers looks the best out of all of them. All the video I’ve seen people trying other people food , it’s always  someone hating on other people food . Hate when people judge other people food & make a disgusting face ! So rude ! You didn’t even give it a try ! Put some respect on it lol What’s the point of this video ?! Just try the damn food ! & just eat it & you might like it ! Smh
God bless, Jesus loves you and died for you all
Cheetah girl is a full blown narcissist yuck
What we learned is none of them make good ramen lol
"This shit look dry as hell"
tf is remen
I'm confused its suppose to have broth
You know they’re brown when they are using a spoon to eat ramen lol
Where tf is the broth???? NONE of them have any damn broth but all have the audacity to complain about dry the others are BRUH lmao
Why are they all eating it with a spoon😂
Are y’all sure they’re in college?.....judging by their reaction to the last girl’s ramen..they seem to not know it’s a soup
All of it looks disgusting to me
I know it's not just me that, the whole ramen broth changes colour with the seasonings...AHHHH. Off topic but, Marcus' hair is really nice.
Cheetah chicks annoying asf
Lil gay urkle
why is every single person rude
I wish they would add people’s response to their losing score at the end.  Lol
Are you all telling me y’all don’t eat ramen with the water/soup?!?!?
Americans eat noodles with spoons and rice with forks. Yall trynna be quirky so bad 😭
Olu aka "African goddess" take ur clumpy chunky ramen & go sit down somewhere!
who eats dry ass ramen with NO BROTH?
Where did people get this idea that Ramen isn’t supposed to have a broth? Lol Ramen is NOT supposed to be dry, if that’s the case then you might as well eat Lo Mein.
Why did they give these people a spoon? Sheesh😭
Olu def top 10 most annoying people of all time on this channel
Are gen z eating a different type of ramen? Lol. Why is there no broth in the first 2
3:13 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why was Olu's ramen CRUNCHY. Girl, this is what happens when you're not humble. It was so chunky 😂 Cheyenne's was the only one that looked good, it's supposed to have SOUP 😭
Its just ramen. Idk how someone could brag about it unless it's restaurant quality. I know some people don't use the water but what a missed opportunity. It also makes you feel fuller which is needed when you're broke.
First things first why tf they using spoons 🤔
People ramen IS SUPPOSED TO BE WET! It’s basically a BROTH WHAT TYPE OF DRY RAMEN YALL BE EATING
Sis woke up and chose to cook food poisoning HOW? HOW DO YOU POISON PEOPLE WITH NOODLES
Ramen is not dry .
Yo, y'all are trying to hard with these ramen. I just add a bunch of thinly sliced veggies like maybe carrot to cut to saltiness a bit and throw a  fried egg on top. Done! The first 2 their dried ass clumpy noodles belong in the bin. Someone learn these kids how to boil noodles you're gonna fry after.
They don't know how to cook them. Let me in 😂😂
I wonder, what do they think ramen's supposed to be like?? It's feels like i'm being pranked rn
Broke college kid talking bout "Not enough shrimp" lmao 🤣
@2:45 She had the nerve to say his ramen was dry, yet she poured hers straight from the pack into the bowl and served it 😂😂😂
It’s always that one person whose food is straight up TRASH that talk the most shi
It’s always the one that be talking the most sh*t, being have the worst dish. 🙃🙃🙃🙃
This is where I would shine I can make it soupy, thick and creamy, light like angel hair. Soft boil egg
Bro just saying the girl that is wearing the cheetah dress does know that ramen is supposed to have water it is soup ramen. And she can't be so mean when her ramen is just a clump and looks soooo damn dry.
Ramen is supposed to have broth????
Real Ramen is a noodle soup it's supposed to have a tasty broth. The noodles should have a nice bouncy & chewy texture and not be overcooked causing them to be soggy or mushy. That being said the 3 dish seemed like the best of the 3.
It’s funny how they’re talking about how the ramen is made as if they majored in culinary. Y’all were broke so ofc it’s gonna be dry, taste less, salty or soupy.
Sooo... The broke college kids are black.... Gotcha
Olu noodles look nasty! 🤢
Girl was it too salty or did it need more seasoning cause I’m confused...........
Oohhh, Olu…🤔
wait... americans doesn't have soup in their ramen? wtf? stick with ur burger I guess...
Ramen is supposed to be watery😫😫😫😫 The broth🤦🏽‍♀️ Who are these people???
Ramen is a SOUP people.. soup is primarily a LIQUID! Come on lol 😂
Why the think ramen supposed to be dry... lol.... u need the broth... but u. An make it less liquid... but come on... all of them was whack....
This is a broke college student ramen recipe. I repeat BROKE. First of all, Where the hell do people find all those spices? Like all those seasonings combined to make the ramen already cost more than a coupon combo at Burger King. Then the clump? The goddamn clump!!!! How the hell do you mess up boiling noodles? Like mush I get but clump and crunch? Girl, your attitude defines your incapabilities 🤢
They should have had prisoners done this, and maybe some diversity
You can afford to stick protein in it but not water to make a broth? Traditionally ramen is a low broth to soup type meal.
Oul “ I like my ramen dry “   Me: we know
i thought that people only would behave bitchy in movies but that girl in the cheetah suit shes just gotta go
I feel like ramen is way too personal of a struggle meal to share with others. I have my favorite ways to eat it but I would never serve it to anybody else!
Uhhhhh the main part of the ramen is the broth 😐😂
Pretty sure crayfish aren't a Nigerian spice.
“This is dry AND crunchy like a bowl of bread crumbs”😂
I noticed a trend with these videos... The more opinionated a person is, the worse they're food is gonna be.
So u telling me these niggas doing something ELSE besides pouring hot water on it? 💀
If this how they Ramen look, we in trouble👀
"Look... it's a clump"  * holds up clump*   lmfaoooo
University of Bridgeport- wow
First off why they eating ramen with a spoon💀😭😭😭
My question is who eats ramen with a spoon
If I was on there all I’m throwing in my noodles is hot sauce 😭
When you rate people lower cuz your cooking is shit...
Naw cause yall dont love the broth 🤨 everyone's looks dry (Spoke to soon the last girl has so moisturizer)
How are you broke and putting chicken in 20 cent package lol. The chicken cost more then 10 packages lol
They always add in one person who’s cocky and their dish isn’t really good. It’s scripted in with other ppls real reactions
Where the helld you find people who are so shocked by wet Ramen? Its supposed to be a soup?
Why did they call the broth water
I love leaving the broth in my ramen 🍜  Actual ramen has a lot of broth in it.
Why don't they know ramen supposed to have liquid?!!
Lmaoo omg
i can't with the comments about the ramen being watery. that water is called BROTH. y'all really out here eating dry ass ramen?? no wonder people are going heavy with the seasoning because *broth* would have taken care of that! (just don't drink too much of it because it is a sodium bomb)
They eating ramen with a spoon... fuck outta here
Ramen is supposed to have a broth! How you gonna serve dry ramen?
So who else is trippin off the fact that they provided spoons to eat RAMEN with 🙄😳
I hate when the person just compares their food. Just rate what you’re eating and hope yours is as good as you think 🙄
Broke college kids  Also includes shrimp
😂😂😂 I thought cheetah print girl’s ramen looked like rice
Yall eat ramen with spoons?
She literally gave them chunks of ramen
well it’s definitely a different...vibe
All looked like trash. And who eats ramen with a spoon?
My mom is Spanish ... is she from Spain ?? If not she’s Hispanic or insert country name... Just cause someone speak Spanish don’t make them Spanish
I should’ve been part of this because I make the best ramen. I know this because I get requests lol
Am I the only one that thought the addition of the soup was a plus??  I mean, ramen noodles are traditional.served in ramen soup.
LMFAOOOOOOO cheetah shirt had some nerve with them blocks she called noodles
so broke ppl are black now?smhhh
They not broke he got chicken in his ramen lol
Why none of them have any broth or shit like wtf they don’t know what ramen is
The Nigerian chick is annoying asf
Do ex-cons try each other's spreads,swoles,bricks lol
Best way I used to make it was boil the ramen in the microwave, quickly drain it, add a little spaghetti sauce with the seasoning packet, then mix it in the ramen.
Who gave them a spoon to eat ramen?
5:37 girl we know
"It's so watery. It looks like it has no flavor. I prefer mine more dry." Y'all. Ramen is supposed to have broth. That's where the flavor comes from. It's okay to drain out the water and just have the flavor packet on the noodles alone, that's bomb too, but dang.
Funny how they all black..
First she said it's too salty then it's no flavor... me confused 😕
cheetah print girl really had us at the first half
Who tf eats ramen with no water
Chicken shrimp whattt uh Broke Coll. Students' HMMMM🤔
Peep they all black and broke😑
The lady with the animal print top says the chicken ramen was salty and then proceeds to say that it needed to be seasoned. She should make up her mind ...
Hell nah neither of them can cook noodles..... & am I the only one that keeps the broth in. Also idc what y’all say, *NOODLES GO ON 5 MINUTES* .... theirs were wayyy too white 💀
Why they gotta be broke and black?🤔
Marcus obviously has never had real Ramen. It’s a soup you moron....
Lmfao its Ramen 😅 which is soup.... it should be wet but sometimes I like it a little dry too depends on what I'm adding lol I love Ramen
Animal print girl be quiet dwl
The mystery...so did the whiny cheetah print girl even add anything to her Ramen? Girl are you that broke that water is not even an option?
The title violated them😂
Olu woke up and chose violence... Literally took the noodles out the pack and served it up. 💀
I'm Ghanaian and I KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW NIGERIAN RAMEN LOOKS-
Best video hands down lmaoo. Had me weak.
LMAO he stayed quiet real quick after taking a bite... shit how y’all judging the food before even trying it. 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄
All y'all ramen looked dry as hell like no damn broth but cheyan was lookin a lil good ngl she was so nice while the other contestants was stuck up😑
Please Nigerians stop boasting on these shows. Most times you end up embarrassing yourselves. Be humble.
yo the title fo me mane
That girl in cheetah think she better than everybody else🙄 and none of their ramen looks good...
You didn’t have to call them broke in the title 😂
theres no way any of these were good if they had to cook them at home then bring them somewhere. instant ramen needs to be eaten ASAP
Asian makes the best instant ramen no cap
Ramen can't be dry with crumps lol
2:05 her voice though
"There's not enough shrimp" Boy this is broke college kids edition!
I only eat the Cup Or Bowl Noodles.  #upperlowclass #boujiebroke
"I'm bringing flavors they've never even heard of" It's instant ramen, Brenda.
Excuse me but how did she just pronounce ramen????
🥴Do they not have water?
Why they eating it with spoons
The ramen chunks one looked the worst imo
They try 2rate low jus so they could try an win 🤦🏾‍♂️
First. Why tf are these ramens dry? Second. Spoon???
A Spoon
Sorry we Nigerians don’t claim her😂✋🏾✋🏾✋🏾🥴cause bye
Spaghetti 🍝
So nun of them had actual ramen before y'all be out dea eating dry uncooked noodles 😂😂
The worst one is always the biggest critic GTFO OLU   got me pissed off
All these people are annoying tbh
So nobody keeps the broth in the ramen...
Cheetah print shorty was popping all that shit and her dish was terrible 😂🤦🏾‍♀️Lmfaoo I cannuh!!
They are talking about Raman.... and complain about being “watery” 🚪🚶🏻‍♀️
The girl with the Afro I don’t think she know how to cook
"Broke Kids" don't go to these schools.
if they aint just made the noodles right before filming, then this shit aint fair lol
Am I missing something, why are they so shocked that Cheyenne left her noodles in broth??   Side note: cheetah girl—please never cook that ramen for anyone else again
Bro I make a 100% better regular ramen than anyone in this comment section ! Mannnnn
SHOUTOUTS TO UB (University of Bridgeport) !! I never went there but that's my city ! We NEVER get mentioned cause ppl barely even know what Connecticut is lol & because Bridgeport is mad ratchet 😂
Nah see you have to leave a little bit of water in there so that when you mix the seasoning in, the water gets sopped up by it and the noodles absorb it.   Then you have a nice, soft, lowkey gooey (but not clumpy) texture with a flavorful and not too salty taste
Wait does no one use the broth??? All y'alls ramen is dry??
Im so confused I thought ramen was most often served as a soup?
Not the chunky ass ramen 🍜 being from the biggest sh*t talker. 💀💀
who tf eats brothless ramen
Cheetah shirt: I like mine a little dry WE KNOWWW!!! With them ramen chunks
“the water” is it not broth lmao
"I'm pretty sure mines will win."  "This shit look dry as hell."  😂
just call it trying each other's instant noodle recipes, not ramen. ramen has broth. only the last girl's "ramen" was close to an actual ramen. Like I'm Indian. We got Magi noodles. We most often cook it dry with spices and veggies and other accompaniments. Ain't no way we can call magi noodles ramen.
Who likes dry ramen🤨 that’s nasty 😂
All of their ramen looks trash to me lol
Instant noodles isnt ramen lol
so basically all they ramen is wack
I would’ve bodied that ☠️
I would've fuck this shit up so good & gave y'all Ramené, like Broke Appetit  😭
Who tf eats ramen with no broth???
Oluwamayowa is beautiful but her attitude is busted
Those two clearly never ate real ramen
The girl with the name no one can pronounce needs to never be on this lol I love when the rude people on these videos get the lowest score.
YOOOO NON ASIAN'S RAMEN IS HELLA DRY WTF
Ya should’ve just said instant noodles because WTF🥴 it’s not giving what it’s supposed to have gave 😭😩🤣🙈
Ramen is supposed to have broth... What's with all the dry ramen? And those clumps were terrifying.
Should you be that choosy when you are broke?
You guys should start putting clips of what the person in last place said.....I‘d love to see what they had to say
Throw a hard boiled egg, some chicken or ground beef, n some crushed hot cheetos up in there lol 😂
How is there ALWAYS a hater in these videos??
The way she talked bout her noodles n the way they looked 😫this has to be staged I swear lol 😂
You gotta go to the dollar store, get the frozen pack of frozen veggies throw that in there. Then from the grocery store you get cooked chicken, an egg (soft boil it) throw in some oyster sauce, soy sauce and hot sauce and BOOM you’re done
Who ever don’t eat there ramen with water your fucking stupid
how she gonna be like it’s so salty then say that he didn’t season it enough 😐😭
the title is so mean
Already knew she lost when she said season your noodles
Idk if it’s just cause I’m from the south but here it’s common for people not to have liquid in their noodles.  Edit: I am aware that traditionally it is made with broth but I’m not sure why the comments are acting like dry ramen is uncommon.
She's giving me "WHERE'S THE FLAVOUR" vibes
Last I checked Ramen had a broth... aint no way ya'll just out here eating dry ass Ramen
Wth 😬😂🤣😂🤣😂
Lmaoo they just called them broke
"It's too salty" I'm done. Ramen is damn near made of salt
Give us a video where the person is mean actually wins. 😂
I’m glad she won, cause that other girl was not giving
“My ramen is coming in with a different vibe” .... yea bad vibes 🥴
I’m glad we all can agree that cheetah print girl was doing too much.

The more i watch these videos, the more I think theyre fake. They seem almost staged
They say “I dont like that it got water” lmaoooo yall know Ramen is a soup right and its supposed to have broth? Its not some pasta dish. It aint suppose to be dry lol the fuck?
They over here calling broth water lmso  Ramen is a SOUP it’s super to be noodles in a BROTH it’s not water lmao y’all weird as Fuckk

Olu just disgraced my ancestors with that ramen
Y’all gave them a spoon to eat ramen Cocoa Butter?
I know my Ramen would have won the the  sauce pack  that comes with it and some hot sauce lol keep it simple or maybe Old Bay season or Old Bay seasoned hot sauce ( I'm from Baltimore Old Bay goes well with everything)
they gave them a SPOON to eat that ramen A SPOON...
This is not broke college ramen
Why always the nicest person wins? And the meanest person looses😃🤚
The spoons are bothering me..
I eat my shi with some valentina
Noodles (ramen) are suppose to be wet wth who eats dry noodles.
So glad the other girl lost to cocky idk not everything need seasonings
See naw y’all got the wrong people for this video, y’all gotta go get them boys/girls who use Seasoning salt, pepper, hot sauce, and shit like that. Y’all got them people who eat ramen every other month. They ain’t really struggling😭😭
All I got from this is that all of them were nasty 😭
Why do they keep saying water its broth 😭😭😭
Everyone failed they used spoons😒
why they using spoons with noodles😐
Im glad Cheyenne won, she was the one who actually put effort into her ramen, because ik damn well her shi was good but the other two was hatin so much on how the dish looked.🙄 ugh that's why they shit was dry🚪.
I want to see ex inmates make their ramen cook ups for each other now
My ramen is just chicken flavored ramen with some chili flakes or powder, some garlic or onion powder, black pepper, and an egg yolk in the center on top of the ramen, and the  stir it in ... So damn good The yolk cooks itself in the hot ramen So it's safe and super rich and good
They complaining about the broth in the ramen and I’m sitting here like “Y’all eat dry ass ramen?”
"Its so salty" and then two seconds later says to season it😭

Y’all know the ramen packets are meant to be SOUP right??? I’m not hating on dry noodles, don’t get me wrong, but why everyone coming for the last ramen for being “wet” 🙄
Why are they eating ramen with a spoon though?
I would definitely eat Cheyenne's and Marcus's ramen, but leopard girl's ramen... THAT WASN'T RAMEN TO ME

“wHo maDe ThiS” 😂
lmfaooooo wait this is funny!!!
The title is a bit mad
I’m annoyed that they gave them a spoon for noodles
Why he look Carl from jimmy nutron
Girl with the cheetah print....you can come to the cookout but bring some plates or something. Bring ice for the drinks but do not bring no food chile. Dont even bring no chips
so far, this series is 8/8 in terms of every single participant tearing down everyone else's food and walking away convinced their version is the best.  boring.
Who  tf let them pull up with them disgraceful bowls of ramen 🍜 let me hop on the show
Nigerian noodles ? With those clumps? Yeah we the people do not approve 🤣❌
maybe add some asian students yall talking bout ramen but got no asain
Bruh no broke college student has shrimp lol better use the shrimp flavor packet and stop playing 😒
I know damn well that not eating them noodles with a soon
Y’all mfs don’t know shit about ramen. Lol it’s supposed to game some type of broth
Why yhu try exposing something tryna get clout
Did they have to bring this already made? Ramen does not travel well!
Cheetah shirt girl said to the guys one “this is dry” then the other girl had water ( which is supposed to have water) she said. “ I like mine a bit dry” LIKE WHAT
Ok first of all, who eats ramen with a spoon ?
I knew how to make noodles in elementary, everybody from the hood did. How do you mess up a meal so simple???
All of them looked gross the last one is the only one that sounded promising
"I would prefer my ramen a little dry" GIRL WE KNOW 😂😂
I still don't believe the broke college student thing is real. I mean depending on how you pay for school, of course. Like me and all me roommates worked jobs and studied full time. Not to mention rice is so much cheaper than ramen, if we were broke we made taco rice not nasty ass ramen.
uuuuuhhhh why y’all give them spoons?
Ofc their black
I went to University of Bridgeport in 2017!!! CT check ✅
Carl from Jimmy Neutron vibes rising 👌
Y’all definitely need some Louisiana people on y’all channel please
Olu said she would of add color to her ramen but where is the color WHERE IS IT cause all I see is clumps
Girl shut up with your dry ahhhhh ramen 🤮😂
cheyenne deserved to win tbh- she’s the only person who kept the broth because ramen literally a soup 😭
First of all, the first two contestants should have been disqualified expeditiously 😂 Ramen is supposed to have broth... who tf eats dry ass Ramen?
Your food should always speak for itself. So It's very telling when people do a lot of talking.
Why do they keep calling the ramen “watery”?... the packets are for seasoning the water to make broth! Have they never seen traditional ramen? #3 did it right! 😂
I should’ve been on here. How y’all pick y’all contestants?
Lmao this girl with the cheeta is annoyingggg
olu or whatever was annoying as fuck omg
Ramen must have some slippage. I dont like a lot of soup but it must have some to keep it from clumping together. I had lunch planned but now I want oodles and noodles.
yall eat ramen with a spoon?
The ramen can be wet lol have you ever ate an authentic ramen before 🤣
does no one put broth in it
I have to admit, I like my Ramen on the drier side.  I don't have a lot of water in it, but It's not desert dry.
None of those looked good
Yo black people shady AF! I love us 😭😭
“ I prefer mine a bit more dry “ Obviously 🧠🔬👩🏿‍🔬
how the hell they gon complain abt the one girl’s ramen having water in it, I hope yall know that in Asia, where ramen originates from, most of the time it is served in some type of broth.
wtf how are they gonna dislike ramen for having broth in it like the stuff they made wasnt even ramen it was just noodles with other stuff
Y does the girl with the cheetah print top sound like she’s reading off a script and acting in one of those tiktok shows
Most of us are under the age of 15 and could do better than that😂
One of the craziest ways I made ramen in the past is to bake a pot pie , then flip it upside down on a bowl of ramen - without a lot of liquid.    My usual way is to add a few shrimp , some frozen veggies, chili  garlic paste .
How do you mess up RAMEN? I know their broke and all, but like it’s the easiest thing ever! Are you joking?
How can I become part of this channel 🥺
I thought it was normal to eat ramen with broth??
But who gave them a spoon to eat ramen 💀
Why they eating it with a spoon tho...
It ain't ramen without a good broth, the broth is the base but I didn't see it on anyone's ramen 🍜.
Girl with the braids.... shorty you baddy
Ramen is supposed to be a soup. It's good dry too but them complaining about the girls soup version... yeah
The one talking the most shit always loses by like 5 trillion points
cup noodles for the win y'all im sorry .. cant fuck that up
Wow I am totally shocked the one that was most critical was the worse
Ramen supposed to have broth wtf why they complaining about it
I like Cheyenne’s personality. 👏🏾👏🏾
Samyang hot cheese or hot carbonara instant ramen both have cheese and are delicious - cheetah-print’s ramen looked/sounded gross but dude scrunched up his face at the idea of cheese in ramen lol
All these ramens look trash
She talked all that shit just to get a 2 LOOOOOL
“Muh-roo-chin”
It bothers me that they gave them spoons to eat noodles....
so. do most americans eat instant ramen dry?. isnt that supposed to be a soup?
I need a redo because why are these noodles extra dry? Lol I like to leave some broth in mine. The only one that wasnt dry was the last one.
is it really this hard to make ramen
I'm here for the where's the sugar where's the cinnamon where's nutmeg comment
Clownery
“Broke college kids” LMAOOO
Its always the mean ones with their food giving trash the compeypey
Tbh the last ramen looked more like ramen.
I would had made a boona and got two 10s ong
How is it salty and unseasoned ?
I don't understand why they are expecting RAMEN to not be WET!!...WHO THE HELL IS EATING DRY RAMEN!! WTF🤦🏾‍♀️
Ramen without broth is a crime df is wrong
I would love to be on this 💯
Alright everyone makes their struggle meals differently lol this the one I wouldn't trust
Why she make NIGERIAN FOOD look like that!!..OH MY GOD!!...WHAT IS THIS!!
Someone come get cassandras niece 🤣🤣 gordon ramsey lite🤣🤣
the cheetah girl is definitely one of those kids who parents have money and paid for her to study in overseas in the US she knows she’s not broke lmao
Hey guys Jesus loves you He died for your sins past,present,and future. He was buried then rose again on the third day so you can be saved,so that you can have the free gift of Salvation.If you want God in your life just seek Him truly put your faith in Him and accept Him as your Lord and savior.It is by God’s grace through faith that you can be saved. Repentance is turning away from sin and turn to God and confessing to Him and asking for forgiveness.❤️
"its everything fa me" killed me Lmao
the guy is so funny lol
This is my favorite series! 😂😂 please never stop doing these
It’s always the person that talks the most trash that ends up in third place lol. Every. Time.
But how people mess up ramen?
All of their ramen look nasty asf
My noodle recipe is  Cooked noodles for 5mins with water  Poor out the water not all  Add the season packet   Mix it  Add ALOT of hot sauce like half the bottle🙃I’m serious  Add lime and uncooked unions    I’m being honest that’s what I eat
Where is the broth 😂
Broke college students...but it needs more shrimp... Son, do you know how expensive shrimp is?!?! Ijs...😑😑😑
I could never come on one of these because my feelings would be so hurt after seeing the other contestants DRAG my food through the mud 💀💀 the fact that all the participants always genuinely think that they have the best food is what's scary too because imagine thinking that you're serving 5 star Michelin chef food just to see it getting dragged and disrespected, bye I would be so butthurt 😅
that dry ass ramen, i nearly choked when i seen it and im not even eating it 💀💀💀
None of them looked better than the other..
You understand that Ramon has a lot of sodium/salt* sped
The first two I’m like why in the hell is the ramen so dry!!!! Ramen is supposed to have a little of the water left in it like the last one. If I did this I’d definitely win lol
Olu had the worst plate there yet she was trash talking everyone else’s 😂😂
why are they all black though
do people really not eat they ramen with the soup???🤨 also none of there's beatin mine, all you gotta do is throw the lawrys seasoning salt in, a lil soy sauce, and a soft boiled egg to go with it, plus that seasoning packet
Afro acting like it gourmet like it's a pack  of ramen
When it was the cheetah girls turn I went straight to the comments
Why did yall have to out broke.
ramen is supposed to “watery”
This title is disrespectful
Marcus and cheyenne passed the vibe check forsure lol
Can they not afford the broth? Chile wtf???
dude got jokes LMAOOOOOO
She gone have a lot of trouble in life with that attitude you thought it was but that ain’t it booboo olu.... and broke college students can’t afford more shrimp.
Cheetah girl was jus talking shit so she can win 😂😂
She said the ramen has water in it. It’s cuz it’s a soup
Do you ppl know what is ramen
Its always the one that talks the most shit that's in the end full of shit.  🖐😒💕
moral of the story: always stay humble so you don’t embarrass yourself like the cheetah print girl
It’s not ramen without any broth it’s just noodles lol but ighhht
Not one HBCU?! 🤭
4:11 when the camera zoomed out and showed the clump of ramen on the table I SCREAMED 😭
First of all... Ramen normally has liquid in it.
It’s always the boujie acting one who has the worst review on there food 😂 no cookin ass
Cheetah print has issues daaiimmmnnnn girl
You can almost always tell which one will be the worst bc they’re rude, picky, & snooty- all while not knowing how to cook 😭
Y'all talking about how the cheetah girl was the rudest, that boy was rude as hell too !
Yo as an asian, watching this is funny as fk! They need to discover the many flavors of instant ramen that us asians buy.
😭😂
The ones who critize the most and boost about their dishes being the best typically have the worst dishes.
Dude no way i saw a comment from a recent vid with the same exact title
Her ramen wasn’t even cooked all the way 🤣🤣
Who cares about colour in ramen lmao
3:04 - 3:25JAJSNFLGKRD
"I like my ramen dry". Oh we know sis, you like it so dry that it's barely cooked. I ain't never seen cooked ramen clump like that before. It's like she served it straight from the pack. It's always funny how the worst cooks always have the most to say. You could tell she purposefully scored the others low.
Both the guy and lady with the cheetah shirt talked a lot of stuff just to lose. It just shows reasons as to keep your mouth shut until the end. I like their confidence though.
Why are people so rude about eachothers food in these videos? Like why?
No man can please the Nigerian lmao
There’s way better recipes out there we need another video
RAMEN IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE DRY
I was expecting her ramen to be some high class shit from the way she was talking 🤣🤣🤣, she didn't even follow the instructions on the packet
Baby girls’ noodles was looking sadddd😂
They went wrong by waking up and deciding to make this 😂
So nobody thought to leave the water in there? Cause all them noodles were dryer than the desert 🏜
so noone bout to ask why they eating with spoons?
Cheetah print was doing the most like what you gotta hate for?
this was hilarious ! more of these more broke student life food !
Here before this shit go viral
OH MY GOD THEY ACTUALLY DID ITTTTTTT
I'm sorry but the loser had so much to say but them noodles she made need water and seasoning !  so what do she do when she cook them pour all the water out them dry the noodles ????
These videos would be more fun if y'all can tone down the disrespect. It's not cute.
girl with the cheetah clothes gotta go. ain’t no way that ramen is EDIBLE. the CLUMPS??? and then was like making faces at wet ramen... ramen is a soup and has a broth, it’s supposed to be wet.. and then said “i like my ramen on the dry side” yeah CLEARLY based off of those clumps of noodles😭✋
All that toughness for what??? And your ramen wackkk lmaoo byeee
Ramen is supposed to have broth. What are they talking about.
"Where did they go wrong"... "It's everything for me"😂 🤣 Olu girl... What happened?
I thought ramen was supposed to have water?
these ppl are so wack pls-
thank god cheyenne won the rest bias as hell 😂
That second one needs more water lol all that for nothing
Who its dry ramen, its suppose to be like cheyennes
yo why the fuck was their ramen dry? that shit was worse than my cotton mouth
Talk shit you lose
Olu from the name I knew she was Nigerian You're too sharp mouthed sis Don't come at me am also Nigerian
Y u gotta call dem broke😭😭
Them eating noodles with a spoon is TRIGGERING me!!!
As a Nigerian myself, no one puts crayfish and whatever the first one was in their noodles 🤢. I thought she was just going to use indomie which is popular in Nigeria
All of their ramen looked TRASH. All of them were dry with no color. And Where is the broth. I Like mines soupy and spicy. Theirs don't even  looked cooked right. Smh
Wow miss ouya console talking the most shit and got the worst score 💀💀
I don't even have to finish the video. Leopard print lady is gonna be dead last. People who are that cocky never win.
this is why you need to use the default flavor packet and not ur own flavors cheetah girl 😔😔
omg that ramen was clapped ngl suprised they got higher than a 5
I’m early
I read a comment joking about such a video idea, yesterday.  And now y’all have actually made it 😂
"IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING NICE TO SAY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL."    Can that be a sign in that room cause other contestants need to take notes.
The fact that actual ramen tends to have a broth and they're complaining about it...isn't sitting right with me
Am I the only one that prefers ramen with actual soup? Like I hate eating plain noodles idk
It’s funny how most of the time the “pickiest” one loses lol
Why do people want dry Ramen? I know it's cheap but it's supposed to be like real Ramen, which is a soup. I can understand not wanting a ton of broth but dry?
I admit with Instant Ramen I do hella dry with some hot sauce.  But like some authentic Japanese Ramen...You paying for the broth.🍜🍜🍜
She talked all that shit about his ramen being dry and then hers was in clumps ,it’s not even the fact that it was bad it was hypocritical 😭
I wish you would show the losers reaction when they find out .
I need commentary after watching this from the girl with the curly hair. 😂 She was talking about what she would add and after seeing their commentary I was like I wouldn't let her touch my food with a 10 foot pole. 😂😂
I got some prison style noodles that would put them to shame
"Mine actually has flavour, mine actually has taste" I am one thrid into this video but I can bet you that she will get the worst rating
Ooh i always threw mixed frozen veggies (corn, string. Beans, that bag) In then dropped a raw egg in it at minute or two until done. SO GOOD.
I don't know why people gotta be mean, I guess that's what makes it entertaining for some but food competitions  can be competitive and not rude.
The one who talks the most smack always loses
Ayeeeee University of Bridgeport 🥰🥰🥰🥰 the hood 😂
Ramen is soup. It’s not supposed to be dry
Ramen is a soup it needs broth fools
The girl with the shrimp ramen WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO KEPT THE BROTH. & the other two DRASGGED her for it, like wut?! yall the ones eating it wrong, and making nasty dusty crusty ramen.
These are children who come from families with money, and their parents just didn't find their college experience. But other than that, they have money 🤷🏾‍♀️ So yeah, straight up broke college students, NOT broke PEOPLE who went to college lmao
This isnt ramen.
Where in the hell is all the broth???? Y'all can afford all these seasonings but no damn water for the noodles? Ramen is a SOUP
I cannot eat dry ramen wtf. If the ramen doesn’t have a broth what the fuck are you doing ??
you can tell the woman in the cheetah shirt has never been told no before.
All looked disgusting. Shocking
Why are they using SPOONSSSSSSSSUHHHHH
I never seen anybody dump all the water out 😐
They gotta be broke, they are using spoons to eat ramen noodles
Yall not rockin with ramen that has broth??? Dry ramen is so nasty 💀
They ain’t from the hood,come 2 the hood 2 get the best ramen noodles ever 😂
we need their reactions after the fact cause this is so funny!!!!
I'm confused as to why they are trippin about the ramen having broth in it...
It’s always the one giving the lowest score who can’t cook 🙄
Cheetah print shorty needs to go. She’s way too stuck up. Come on sis it’s just to see who has the better cheap ramen recipe, not top chef material. She needs several seats with her brutal review. Okay Simon Cowell!
Ramen made with broth
the nigerian girl was mean asf 😭
"three broke college students" haha. Is ramen synonymous with being broke, because I really love it! I feel personally attacked haha🤣. **(im joking btw)**
Neuroscience! WOW! <3
I remember these days...😂. You gotta save the packets from the Chinese spots to add to it. If you had the budget add an hardboiled egg, hotdogs or chicken- Rotisserie chicken, add it to it to make it more of a real meal.
I didn’t realize I was early until I read the comments. Also the mean one always has bad food somehow 🤷🏽‍♀️
“Being broke is wack” a truer statement has never been said 😩
The second one looked like half of it was still uncooked. How do you have clumps in your ramen? All of their ramens look nasty though.
How are these “broke” college students, but they’re adding shrimp and chicken 🤣
The Nigerian chick must be an actress. She's an actress, right?
Welp, I learned that anyone who comes on here describing their dish as a 'vibe' or a 'lifestyle' is probably not supposed to be anywhere near a kitchen. It's ok, sis, use your degree for anything else and hire a cook 🤷🏿‍♀️
finally i'm early lol
It’s always that one person who talk hot shi abt everyone else’s food😑
THEY WERE ALL BAD jeez the best among the worst i guess is Cheyenne’s ramen
Of course the nicest person wins, and the meanest has the worst dish
I relate to this on a deep level 😂🤦🏾‍♀️
The second one was rough
All you need is a bunch of seasonings and you can make the ramen into anything you want.
Third! Lol
Second!!
First🥰
