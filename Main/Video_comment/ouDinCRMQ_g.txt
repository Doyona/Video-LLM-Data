who's going to be watching the race on sunday? 🏁
Putting a professional skateboarder against Max Verstappinfornun is criminal.
A good driver on his day but G.O.A.T not yet after all his first Championship was because of a cheat within the FIA, he can drive really brilliantly but chooses to push others off track, whinges like a child when it’s been done back at him. Couldn’t cope when Hamilton who is famous for his overall fairness on track decided enough pushing off was enough so very cleverly ensured Max went off at Silverstone instead of himself. When he actually gets 7-8 Championships under his belt and shows he can race clean then he can claim greatest of all time, but others have been far more deserving. As to the “you have to be over aggressive and single minded to win that’s not quite true because some of the real greats raced in a gentlemanly manner and did win championships of more value. Let’s face it in days of old over 30 cars took a start then 26 so 20 cars on many of those old tracks does give plenty of space.
The other person: top 900 hp Max: its enough
Oh My God!
Sad that at the outset instead of watching, they are all filming. Societal affliction.
Max looked just like a kid with a new toy that he has instantly fallen in love with. Thanks for the video.
Max took the inside line hahha
Still faster than RB21
dun dun dula MAX VERSTAPPEN🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Max ❤
so this is what it would look like if a car and a boat had a child
I miss these kinds of contents..
Max waa comfy with it caz it's no different from his f1 car
Yuki should maybe change carrier :D
This would be one race I'd happily lose
Anyone here after yuki joined redbull?
lore accurate second redbull seat
Looks fun!
Desert Cycle bobcat tires
Why is the black dude trying so hard to be noticed 😂
Make Franz proud lol
Why do I get the feeling that Max would have the same level of concentration and seriousness if he was racing kids tricycles as he does in F1.
Good to see Jett Lawrence hanging with Max.
Omg…hilarious
Хорошее удовольствие ,,можно погонять ну так себе ,, у нас лодок много ,,предпочитает на су 37 по летать на выходных 😊😊
Чёрный проиграл
Yuki beat Max in an Alpha Tauri. I think he should go back :p
Max takes racing SO seriously. love it.
This hits different now, after Yuki's first practice session in the RB21.
and now 2025 they are teammates at redbull racing
Hot take - F1 drivers are way overrated! (Those cars are insanely advanced in tech)
2025 oh yaaaaaa yuki
I swear I’m introduced to the coolest thing I’ve never heard of because of a random Red Bull video in my recommended
And now they're team mates
These are optimal shape and designed to perfection. While everyone lore accurately the pefect shape for bogging is truck...
Looks like 2025 Japan grand prix trailer
Lawson out... Yuki in... and it's races like this (and other promo events like this) that show how adaptable Yuki really is.
Other companies: buy my drink for a cod code for in game items!   Meanwhile redbull: today we are going to try and launch a f1 car into space on the moon and race it!
Horrible editing. Show more racing
This a salt lake course
GOAT stuff
Oh thats so fun! And i like the other racers too!!
it's so cool how these buggies look like pre-war Auto Union Grand Prix cars
2:26 here goes max Verstappen 💀
So many rich people and none of them can hold the phone correct when recording, wow.
Yuki <3 such a great driver whatever hes driving
Tsunoda is still one o my favorite drivers on the grid.
Why do people ever claim to be from Florida? It's such a joke.
Veratappen is the best
Yes training for brazil 24 i see
Obviously Max let yuki win..
These swamp buggies sound a lot like NASCAR cars.
Why is Max always stalling vehicles lmao
I know the gators didnt appreciate the disturbance
Looks like Yuki understood the spirit of this kind of vehicle. Less about cool, calm and precise and more about hammer down and a bigass rooster tail
Where can I buy a max cap?
I just wanna know who's idea was it to name them buggies...
Max telling Yuki “Make France proud” hahaha
Weight saving is definitely more significant in water
Yuki always wins these guess he’s just a better driver 🤷‍♂️
is this need a license ?
So no youtube mesmo pro yuki ganhar do max
This is what happens when rednecks get bored. LOL I love it.
Max just didn’t want to get wet
Max: Jotaro Yuki: Josuke
@0:17 WTF happened to Naples?
That tiny Chinese dude has an unfair weight advantange. A lawsuit is eminent...
Only thing missing from the video is a native Seminole and an Aztec and Arab but almost guys keep treeing
WTF happened to him? He looks 60yrs old.
Bro literally re-create tokyo drift in swap
Тпок суров, сел за баранку и тапочком не отжимая.
Tu-du-du Max Verstappen!
Interesting to see AlphaTauri has got a pull-rod front suspension while Red Bull has a pushrod one
Max while driving: 🫥  Yuki while driving:🤣
Clearly this means Yuki should take Max’s RB seat
Ok ich muss zugeben, wenn zu mir jemand sagen würde: du darfst mal damit fahren, würde ich es ausprobieren. Nur, wie soll ich mich da ausdrücken ?!, weder gefallen mir diese Swamp Cars, noch finde ich es spannend. Ich hab das Video gesehen, es war lustig, doch es reicht mir auch. Da sehe ich mir sehr viel lieber ein weiteres Seifenkisten Rennen von euch an. Daran erinnern mich diese Swamp Cars. Ein Seifenkistenrennen ist wenigstens, vielseitiger, lustiger, ec.
great memories of watching these as a kid inn the 80's with my uncle growing up!  Some of them are so funny looking ...they're the coolest!
Max at the corner in turn1💀
☠️imagine coming under those tyres
Sometimes I forget is a brand that makes drinks and not only sports
Max was not messing up his look
you think X is so behind he will lose... but in the end X not only changes paradigms but also stays dry..
really cool seeing different sports brought together like this, never thought i would see zion and max in the same vid haha
You could have shown drone view. Worst angles
Finally yuki won something
Max most definitely did not want to get wet by the end of the
Max starts in behind, passes on the inside for the win, then emerges from the car bone dry somehow while his opponent is dripping with swamp water hahahaha
You know that something is cool when an f1 driver records it on their phone
Yuki did what Hamilton couldn’t, beat Max Verstappen in a race! Lol
4:42 rare footage of max not winning
Kinda seems like the white one was way faster acceleration wise
Grew up wakeboarding and watching parks on fuel tv. So crazy to see how he’s aged! Man time goes by fast
Verstappen is like a robot. Barely smiling.
Red Bull be making bangers
Still people don't know how shorts work.. there's a link to full video! 🤦‍♂️
This needs to be used as a way to start making cites on the water
Dude moved from Australia to Florida lol yea that sounds about right
Max is clearly allergic to fun 🫤
Wonder if this will be in GTA VI.
Yuki had the right spirit. Glad he won.
The fact max joke about the wheelie and yuki actually doing a wheelie
suddenly I playing tokyo drift sound on yuki's wheelie
the fact that all drivers are recording means something
Max eats corners for breakfast
Crazy cool man lol
Do do da oo
Is it me or it sounds like a nascar…
Haha. Still using the racing line in whatever this is. Go Max!
Que viagem
Max doesn't chill at all.
that's why F1 Driver it's the best driver in earth 🤣
narcissisticcc.. personalityyy... disorderrr.. Max
The Trophy was taller than yuki😭
florida man anomaly
ตามมากจากติกตอก Thailand🇹🇭
i love redbull puttting f1 drivers in cars that could no way be correlated to f1 cars
Zion a prick in person
Crazy races Yuki ftw 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Yuki es el mejor
verstappen just has supremme confidince
Yuki to red bull teaser?
Max: « Be carefull when you take off » (laughs)  Yuki: (takes off)
That shot of Max overtaking the dude in the first race reminded me of "The boy just goes and finds grip anywhere else"
for them the feeling is like going 10 kmh
Yes Yes Yes
I think these videos are so great but might be edited too short! Would love to watch a longer video of that. Around 10-12 min perhaps.
Man yuki has no chill
Yuki is literally flying
Yuki is a menace in that thing!
Soon as Electric version
the chinese man wins
Never forget, no matter how good you are, there Is always an Asian that us better.
given the same kind of material, Max does not stand a chance.
jakby powycinac te glupie okrzyki to by wyszlo ze to nie jest takie super mega najlepsze na swiecie
Take your masks off! Follow the science already. They’ve admitted, finally, that they are arguable…the same as nothing at all, and considerably worse in many cases. Science science science
This is where the capital that is stolen from the working class goes. "Puma" was founded by a Nazi.
Also the only time Yuki will ever beat max lol
nice
Yukki toretto
Menuda chorrada.
Max not a drop of water allowed on him. 😂
All Max wanted was not to get wet. As soon as Yuki is in front all he does is evading the flying water. It is obvious that Max could not care less about this event
he had to get the tyres warm first
Can’t tell the difference between this and the 2022 Suzuka gp
The engineering is amazing but this is the dumbest motorized race I have ever seen
Swamp racing is so exciting!
Max: calm and composed start Yuki: waking his inner Dom torreto
Max would’ve hated losing 😂😂
Imola 2023
Oh my god, 2023 Emilia Romagna GP is incredible!!!
They should race these in the emilia romagna gp 2023
Man, the FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS GRAN PREMIO DEL MADE IN ITALY E DELL'EMILIA-ROMAGNA 2023 was amazing. Really proud that Yuki pulled his first win off at this historic track.
new design for Imola race 2023
This could be a viable alternative for Imola.
Imola gp 2023
Damn, yuki is better on the water than on the track, in Yuki Boats or swamp buggies.
Maybe the only time Yuki Tsunoda was able to overtake Max Verstappen
This is one of the most Florida things I’ve ever seen.
These are the dumbest vehicles ive ever seen
こういう企画では毎回引っ張りだこの角田
Y U K I
Watching max lose feels so good
yuki really said yeet on the start
max verstappen fav driver ever
The trophy is big  as Yuki almost bigger than him
Was the swamp buggy race in rattle snake road in Naples
that's you
I have the paper you were waiting for the house.
Not to mention the odd looks, that was the slowest 900 hp in the world
Yuki wins but so wet😢
This would’ve been cool if you showed more of the races, and less of the people with their fones.
Awesome
I can’t watch anything where people are wearing masks.
Yuki should take up swamp buggy racing!
I always loved watching swamp buggy races, they're just so unique.
Ridiculous to burn up the atmosphere and our children's future for such foolery. Way too much testosterone induced human hubris.
Dr. Marko after seeing this:  “Hello Yuki, welcome to Redbull”
Black guy is annoying
what the hell!!?? this  arm fishis under ther !!!!  thats not normal!!  forgett it!!!!
They used to have swamp buggy racing on ABC wide world of sports on Sunday when I was young
I would hope these Drivers got a chance to run a few practice laps to get a feel for the controls and the steering ..
Looks slow and noisy.
Yuki is so smol! Get in mah pocket!
If red bull likes this comment, I’ll stop drinking r*costar & will sport red bull stickers
Verstappen passing and flooding him on the 1st turn was the most max thing ever 😅
I heard the word "Florida" and all made sense.
Disappointing. All the camera is focused on is the celebrity’s very little car action, typical American.
The brings back the memories of Diamond P sports on the Nashville network - love to see the swamp buggy races are still alive and well
I bet those roll bars are high so if a flip occurred the driver would be dry
Most stupid form of motorsport I've seen .....why oh why do yanks play in mud and water
so instead of the cars, we see celebrities screaming at what we should be watching... crap video
yeeee yeee the 239 boooiiiisss
I loved watching swamp buggy racing on tv but it's not on any of the channels anymore. They need to bring it back on.
Max serious face when he races get me everytime
What about jett Lawrence chilling there
Never seen a swamp buggy. I want one
Yuki was sending that thing like he was born for it.
So at no point do they actually race anyone who is experienced?
"I can't even see the pedals!" You don't need to see the pedals when your eyes should be on the course.
It's so weird the here my name and actually pronounced the same
I get the motorsport connections but a rollerskate tied to a lollipop stick I'm not sure how they mesh together   ;-)
Good way to get brain eating amoeba
Definitely fun and if I'm honest, I'm envious and would love to drive it myself.  But when you get right down to it ... there is nothing more unnecessary in this day and age
Dude beat him on the turn, drenched him and walked away dry
We’re doomed.
0:57 Reallyとwheelieかけてるのうますぎる
I would so do that
shouldnt you be saying "ours" instead of "us"? or what does this us relate to? xD
Who makes these swamp racers ?
Werde das nie verstehen
World's best 🤔😐
Zion's was hyped!
Any world class racer of a motorized vehicle is guaranteed to be two things. -competitive -good at racing anything with an engine  The redbull buggy was way slower, there is zero chance an f1 driver is going to be taking it easy if you challenge them to anything, especially a race.
@cleetus need to try this!
Fire extinguisher in the middle of the water? Check out 2:30, I’m so confused.
F1 drivers are the most posh fart lovers
Lets show more of the incredibly cool machines and less of the random people reacting and cheering please..
i bet max has the exact same face when driving anything
Bad ads
I can't in good conscience watch a video of people taking a video. I might, if they weren't holding their phones vertically.
This sport looks like something the McDoyle's from It's Always Sunny would compete in, with a competitive legacy going back generations. It also looks very fun.
I love they all their phones out recording standing right next to a film crew they could get footage from later
What is this?? Florida please explain yourself...
一位🥇とるお利口さんは日本人でも 濡らされるのが日本人っぽいなー。芋いなー
Half boat half big foot trucks
Ramp 48 represent 🤣🤣
roaring snails?
Max is soo bad bro lost to sombody in alpha touuurriii
Yuki is a freak talent. Just watch him over the next couple of years. His ascension to F1 is the fastest in the modern era.
Trash post thumb it down. A few seconds of racing the rest the cam in on those lameos.
red-neck bull
January 1st 2023 marks the first time I have EVER seen this type of racing
What a weird sport...
In this video: Yuki beats Max in equal machinery...
I so miss watching them on TV in the 80s with my Dad. Uhhhh, I just keep thinking of what they are stirring up in there then getting into their mouths. 🤢
Man, who needs F1, anyway ?
All these people are filming with their phones upright. They might be idiots.
What a waste shows more people than swamp buggies
Florida Man, Ok, Say No More My Friend..
All those dopes on the balcony watching life through a phone, goofball central.
what happens when you roll over? do you drown?
Yuki winning a trophy almost as big as himself. Only in America, or maybe only with a Japanese tiny man. Anyways lol
That white buggie seems to be significantly faster than the red bull one.
I wish people just lived in the moment and didn’t film everything on their phones all the time
Not fair!! Max is arguably the best driver in the world right now...vs a scateboarder!!
Seems practical lol
Swamp buggy races NEED to be back on tv  Loved to watch them
Jesus doesn't seem like the fairest race when the wake on these will blind you.
I feel like the water should provide for some good cornering ability.
TIL Yuki wins in same machinery
Americans are nuts lmao
horribly shaky camera
Logical development from paddle boats.
Based on how yuki was driving he definitely seemed like he was less afraid than the rest of them. He just went ham
Yuki nice with it
its funny seeing Zion doin this😂
I want to know when @cleetus mcfarland is going to get into this. This seems right up his ally
only in Florida
omg, i used to watch this years ago when they had it on the TNN channel! i didn't know this still existed.
this is such a florida video
A ton of fun. We used to go when we lived in Naples.
Awesome video, low swamp buggy racing
What's up with those thin bicycle tyres?
certified "free bird" moment of yuki tsunoda
Great video with my favorite driver the best on F1 ❤
Let Yuki drive a dragster
People never stop comming up with ideas of things to race. It's like, "If you can get it to move, shucks, let's race it!"
Nobody asked
This is the dumbest sport ever. So much horsepower and so much fuel wasted to go so slow. Retarded.
Someone took the feeling of driving through rain puddles and made it a competitive event. Amazing.
Another no good reason for another "sport". Oh wow that's cool, drivin on water it's like Jeebus!
true athletes
Terrible camera work.
what a freakin cool !!!
Americans, hillbillies to the core, idiots
Make sure the f1 drivers win guys.
Florida looks like a nice planet.
I was just thinking how long it’s been since seeing a swamp buggy race.   Yup, still good
Why?
Don't animals live in the swamp or are these man made
Yuki Tsunoda, honorary Florida Man. Just give him FL citizenship at this point tbh and make anyone who objects race him in a swamp buggy
Time has not been kind to Parks Bonifay.
Amateur camera work
This might be the dumbest motorsport ive ever seen.
I never even knew these existed. But I wanna try this shit for sure.
lets seee them races agens the king of the swomp
Yall need to do a show with zion and Jamie foy
We all know this was staged. Everyone knows asians can't drive.
I literally stopped watching and gave you a thumbs down just for all the idiots wearing face mask👎.
I bet the neighbors will be happy when everything goes electric.
Max is een Rechtop Filmert, beetje jammer HAHAHA
Probably the dumbest thing i've seen a while
900hp... so...... how do swamp buggy's handle bumps on a normal road?
Never knew such car boats existed!
What a waste of fuel
I love the  swamp buggys  there awsome .
That's not a fn swamp buggy. That shit was never what they built. I've been on more than you and the damn things crawl. This is an abortion of the term.
Бездарности дали победить…..
Americans just invent sports in spite of climate change I swear ....
Yuki Tsunoda is the Sultan of Send.
Shows you that anyone with the balls can drive those things. That’s literally with almost all vehicle sports.
As if a skate boarder could ever have a chance of winning a motor-anything race against an F1 world champion. Who knew?!
Race for grandpas
Mudders and rudders.
I remember going here 20+ years ago
"OH hay look at these cool swamp buggies! I'll bet you want to see random spectators holding their phones instead of the action!" Said the editor.
pandering trash
😊👍🏻
Max must have been happy to race in an event where he could actually *overtake*.
Why could I see the grand tour guys doing a swamp buggy thing
The only time that alphatory will surpass Red Bull is in a race like this
This is such a beautiful Florida thing right here!!!
EAT MY WAKE!
This is a new thing I will now watch.
Geez the guy narrating kind of sounds like Jack Black to me. 😄
Redbull spending so much money on crazy sports, just goes to show how much they overcharge for their drinks. Literally nothing good about them , they  are test tube made
Boat with extra steps.
Well, that's another sport I never knew existed, and now I'm really upset I've never heard of this until now.
I cannot believe that this is an actual sport. I have seen many ridiculous things in my life but this tops in by quite a margin...  How do you end up with this? "Lets flood a field to do racing on it, but lets do it in a way that the water cannot be deeper then70cm or we are going to drown and now more shallow then 15cm or the cars are going to fall apart!" Its like the swole doge vs chems meme of offroad car-racing.
Important people need no mask
Swear to god Asians are good at everything
That's not a swamp!  Thats a hard packed rice patty!
Of course it’s in florida
More than half the footage is faces of people I don't care about. Show the real content. This shouldn't be a reality show.
"Murica
a classic redbull thing
Damn this is what you do when you're an old washed up wakeboarder   Love it
Yo I can’t believe the f1 drivers won
Yuki sets a new track record lol 😆
you cant just enter a swampbuggy race and expect to win without training. Doesnt matter if your the best f1 driver in the world...
If mother nature designed a creature based on this, I'll kill my self
What a natural racer Yuki is! Gets in the weirdest contraption and blows everyone away
The white one was way faster
"MAX VERSTAPPEN UP ON THE INSIDE"
Max be like, oh it is the same as in Spa
Does Cletus McFarland know about this I feel like this is the best of both worlds for him
Here we see max doing a practise lap for the Singapore gp
Who said they are the world's best drivers? Rally drivers?
for max this is like going from a road bike to a plastic tricycle
yuki beat verstappen in equal machinery
Killer!!!
Sanest f1 driver.
wow, know i now there is such thing as swamp racing! that was fun!
Bruh Max is so competitive, even when is for fun!!!! Jeeeezzzs Chilllll mannnnn 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow, Red Bull uhh Alpha Tauri never disappoints;-)
Yuki-kun: This is not a good idea. Litteraly every idea us men thought up was a bad idea. But it's always so much fun, the bad ideas.
awesome
Way to go Yuki!!!!
Do they never invite Gasly?
Redbull those the greatest and funniest things ever with there sporters but i never thought max and yuki would be so fun to Watch, max always wanted to win but dutch nuchtheid and yuki just fun and going for it 👍👍
_Yuki Tsunoda_ - Florida Man.
I love this. V8 babyyyy
Really y'all? F1 trying to get to the Bayou Boys too?
zions doing good
yuki may be small but the dude got balls of steel
N'importe quoi lorsque des gens fortunés s'ennuient
Zion is the best. Florida represent.
Ofcourse this is in Florida, Florida people are only crazy enough to do this.😑
A Yuki Sonoda other sports than his own sport
I miss watching this on TV. It was the best.
fact : "Vintage American Ford Roadster Dodge Brothers Designed With Acceleration Through The Concrete Streets Finneas ; innovate before participating in flight challenges" ©
well, now we know where Yuki will be sent to compete if the psychologist doesn't work hahaha
el trofeo es mas grande que yuki jajajajaj que tipazo yuki
im from Naples bruh how could I miss this
well thats a first..
oh yeah, just some friendly competition. *pulls out 4 foot championship trophy*
Proof Yuki is just better
Max was keeping a straight face the whole time. 😐
Yuki sent it !
Yuki: How fast this goes? Other person: 300 kmh Yuki: "oh not bad"
At least Yuki finally got to feel what it's like to beat Max!
Please make this be an official motorsports.
Max, the driver you hate to love.
The only race wherer Tsunoda wins over Max
yuki need to go to swamp racing
Yuki Tsunoda  did Florida proud with that wheel stand
Max flooding all of his opponent and act like nothing is happen 🤣
すげえ楽しそう☆
La única vez que Yuki le va a ganar a Max xD
Mercedes seeing them bounce: "Write that down write that down!"
Смотришь на эту херню и понимаешь как пытаются циноду в медиа продвинуть
The host looks like a discount Gerard Butler
I never knew these things exist , this is one of the most American thing ever.
Yuki’s an animal lol, good vid
alaburger como acelero el enano
Verstabitch
most american thing I've ever seen
This is the most Murica thing I've ever seen🤣
Где ещё увидишь, чтобы Тсунода обогнал Макса?
I don't like f1, as it's shit as a competition...i randomly stumbled upon some live cast of f1 races....in recent history one thing remained burned hard into my brain. Max Verstappen being bullied by various drivers that don't race cleanly. I started rooting for him like a month or two ago as he seems to be a good racer and a "good sport".  F1 is shit. Max Verstappen is cool. Go Max!
I find it strange that Coca-Cola sponsors nothing of any value but makes way more then redbull but redbull puts so much money into the lives of others . It's nice
I’m a Luis fan… and this is the best thing I’ve ever seen 🤣
What’s the point of twelve people recording the same thing?
Could be interesting if you showed some actual racing. This is the poorest videography I've seen all day. WE DONT GIVE A RAT"S ASS ABOUT THE ONLOOKERS.
Max showing pure Max stuff 😆
Cool 😎😁👏👌👌
Soo lame
Max Verstrapon = Zero charisma
Yuki has a much better F1 team in his future. I'm not so sure that Gasly does...
Red bull marketing truly know how to do. It
Of course the 2 f1 guys won..... scripted as shit
Cool. Money funded adrenaline.
need that post win banter!
I think Max only cared about not getting wet hahaha
What the hell has youtube recommended to me now 😆
Yuki found his new calling. Florida.
I love me some swamp buggy racing
américa, waouuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yuki was off the pace due to severe porpoising.
not a phone in sight
Oh my god the balls of steel Yuki must have. I love how he just set off with a wheelie.
max is so calm and collected
I guess there is some emotional damage being overtaken and also getting splish-splashed at the same time.
Mal filmé, hyper frustrant
I had all my money on Yuki!!!
Didnt know Yuki could actually finish a race without hitting something 😆 nice to see him win tho
when are you doing more races
Al the effort to wrap those things in team colors just for another short film again, incredible! Like the management says, I want you to burn our marketing budget and exceed it way beyond the reasonable. I’ve been following Red Bull for years and years already but stil don’t drink it.
I love how Verstappen was saying how impressive it is how the car skates over water and how responsive the car is, and the other dude is stoked that he got wet
フェルスタッペンvs角田ってまた珍しい組み合わせやな……
Max didn't seem to have fun
I‘m dead 💀 Max soaked the snap out of him
角田おるやん
i want see max vs lewis on this
Love how Yuki goes all Leroy Jenkins on the start
Yuki is nuts! What a wheelie!
I dislike redbull f1 racing team... mostly because of Horner.   What red bull is very good at doing is showing me new sports I've never heard of. This is so stupid, I love it.
God I hate Max.
This is the most Florida things I’ve ever seen. And I live here.
In the past I watched swamp buggy racing on TV quite often.
0:09 I was hooked from the words "Florida Man
Spa 2021/Monaco 2022 conditions in a nutshell
Looks so fun
So cool to see the f1 guys chilling with the skate team
Porque Verstappen no puso el DRS así hubiera ganado 😐
F1 driver race not-cars is my new favorite genre of video.
now max knows how yuki feels in his slow ass f1 car compared to the rest of the grid
This looks like so much fun. Great videos, love to see this side of the drivers.
living in naples its great to see we do have some fun stuff here
even swamp car got porposing :v
Não gostei da participação de Max pois ele obteve um conduta antidesportiva ao perder a corrida assim mostrando sua verdadeira face.
Jack Black narrating??
4:16 Abu Dhabi 2021 intensifies
We need these cars in spa😂
POV: F1 Qualifying in Montreal, Canada. 😂😂😂
Great fun. Wondering if its allowed considering some sjit happens? Its only a 35 milj. Contract ......
Why did I have a feeling that this took place in Florida. Oh... I know! Because insane stuff like this only happens in Florida.
jejeje ya sabemos a donde ira a parar yukie cuando termine su carrera en la F1 😂😂😂😂😂
So, Yuki has a valuable career in swamp buggy racing after F1?
Yuki supremacy
We need more content like this
Max is not sending it on the inside just in F1, he's doing it in these tractors too!
I love when red bull, doing great and fun with their athlete #gg.
Max is always great in the wet
Hereeeeeee comes yuuuuki
Yuki is a monster of a driver
This puts a whole new meaning to wet weather driving
the race between max and zion showed who the racer was
Yuki handled that like a boss!
Verstappen not even a little damp lol
That's a good training for Monaco and Spa.
Yuki the Real Florida man
So this would be a "slipSTREAM"
Not sure "floridaman" is an adjective you wanna use
RedBull Vs Alphatauri swamp edition
This is what I've always wanted to see! There's nothing like a man fighting hot and hard for his life while getting sloppy and sloppy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
おもろ
Very interesting 👍👍
That has to be the most American way to say “Max Verstappen.
if Yuki only would do this in F1....gotta love him....
Max somehow didn't get wet like at all lmfao
damn they should've pulled these up on Monaco '22
Boycott this stupid company.
Yuki will replace Checo after he will leave Red bull
Stupid this thing
After all that, max not but a drop of water on him😂
N1 jackass and mtv trash tv are so much 2nd millenium, Red Bull is so much 3rd millenium.
将来F1でもこうなるといいね
And getting a bunch of gross florida herpes swamp water on me? Hard pass.
💙⃢💚⃢💜⃢💛⃢❤️
🔥🥵🔥 ............... 🔥🥶🔥
YES!! Max driving swamp buggies is the most American thing ever!!
Yuki was born for this
Did we just see the future. Yuki joining RB and smoking max?
woow
Max has ice water flowing through his veins but Yuki has balls of steel.
I miss the days these would be boardcast on tv. They also had a jeep class as well where they would have like 10 of them race at once.
Yuki Is truly the better Floridaman.
Max is just chill
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️❤️ red Bull
Dude got Rosberged.
yuki is a madman
No best of three for the final?
Seriously, how can you not love Yuki?! The dude´s hilarious, sweet, cute. 😍
😂😂😂
Tsunoda win the water grand prix his first win in formula 1
Conclusion of this video: Yuki >>>> Max

unreal fun
Yuki is like: RROOOARRRR..!!! This is my thing 😆😆😆
Nice 👍 Looks like so Much fun 🥰
3:17 I don't know why it took me so long to realize that this was a Gastly reference.
should have gone 10 laps
when farmers get slightly bored of their job.  we racin in the swamps
Swamp x
Max is so competitive on anything. This dude scares me
this is so fun to watch
crazy coll🙃
日本語字幕ありがとうございます！😃
The only time alpha tauri is gonna beat red bull.  😂
yuki tsunoda be like: hold my red bull
In equal  machinery Tsunoda is faster than Verstappen
将来のコンビになりますように。なるでしょう。
Yuki going full throttle all the time. SEND IT!!  😂 😂 😂
Don't got bogged in the sippy hole
🤣🤣🤣 Yuki sent it
Max is straight-up serious!
I would not have expected to see Yuki Tsunoda in a Alpha Tauri (branded) vehicle beat Max Verstappen in a RB. No tech issue, no DNF, Yuki just straightout won the race. I have now seen it all.
I feel like Yuki is being groomed to be the next big star. And I love it.
Yuki: So I woke up in Florida, Just gonna send it!!!

Yuki the Swamp Monster
Trophy taller than Yuki? 😂
Anyone know where you can get the hat at 1:31 ?
Max go BACK TO BACK!!!!!!!
角田くん、やったね、ワールドチャンピオンだ！
porpoising Yuki
Max really using racing line here😂😂
And the blue car again had reliability issues
I like that the guy actually introduces himself as "Florida Man".
Yuki F1 world champ material lol
yuki unleashed his inner florida man!
I'd love to see Yuki at Red Bull, with equal machinery.
Yuki Tsunoda. That's it. That's the comment.
Not a Max fan, but this was funny,
Verstappen is not a world champion
china
In swamp buggy racing, Yuki WillSoakYa.
Jett lawrence 🤘
You know what sucks is that I LIVE IN NAPLES and I had 0 CLUE YOU GUYS WERE THERE!!! Next time let me know 🥲
Disable
Omg love this cute combo
The trophy to Yuki ratio doesnt look quiet right haha
If Lewis raced there...    Max would've been two tenths faster.
Zion wright and max verstappen best collab
max is good in whatever he's driving, amazing haha
Is this a swamp race or spa 2021
Max staying dry throughout this whole thing is so impressive ahahahah
Sad that Jett didn’t get to race
No it's not fixed
Yuki was propoising lol
Yuki got the clean side of the track
You  am see Max at 0.45  thinking. why are they shouting like 10 year old kids ??
Red Bull had 1 DNF out of 3 races. Technically just like in real life in F1 🤣🤣
Best 5 minutes and 30 seconds I’ve spent
This is one of the most florida things I‘ve ever seen
You guys sure you didn't put actual Red Bull in Yuki's buggy?
Why did they choose a Skate pro ??? i really dont get it. he probably dosent even now what a clutch is.
フェルスタッペンはこういうイベントで怪我をしないよう押さえて走り、角田は何も考えず思い切り攻める！って感じがするな。
And this is where they get the information to manipulate prices on
after seeing this yuki deserves max's seat
trophy is bigger than yuki lmao
Seems like Yuki is switching to swamp buggy racing now
Max always finds grip 🔥
So cool
They needed these in Belgium last year
Ｖ８エンジンを積んでいるのね。色んな意味で凄いね！
Amazing to see!!!
Yuki WDC confirmed
1:56 Max looks like a dad with 4 kids who tell’s everyone he installed all the electricity in his house by himself. (And a NASCAR driver)
いつか本当のF1でYUKIがMAXにぶっちぎりで勝つレースを待っているよ！
"Make France proud". Love his humor
Yuki is almost as big as his trophy
I have enjoy the the Swamp river race with Yuki Tsunoda and Max Verstappen and swamp buggy racing on land in the cars.
Is this “Gators Gone Wild”?
Why are the bothering to film them on their phones? There will be cameras present specifically for the purpose. Who are they going to show the footage to?
never seen anything like that. wild
That's the most Florida thing I've ever seen😂 Red bull is the coolest F1 team ever, they have the money and they do the things every child would dream of. I love it
Yuki is faster than me
That was great.  Great to see Jettson at these events mx/sx need all the exposure they can get. Why Dunkin or Krispy Kreme aren't Jettson sponsors is mind boggling.
Yuki needs to race Verstappen in a F1 car
RedBull destroy Sport everywhere
I like the competitive look on the Max's face while driving So determined to win the race but well played Yuki
Stuff like that would be way more enjoyable without that racist shitshow in the upper Management........
Off course it's a Florida man
This looks super fun.
I love how literal these cars are with front traction, you let off the gas, it lowers the two massive rudders
Homeboy still got his australian accent  I live in Australia been here for 16 years end of 2022 but I still can't pull an Australian accent
Damn, Yuki doing Dom Toretto takeoff is incridible
both yuki and max are super aggressive!  🤣🤣🤣  a racing driver is a racing driver every where!
Please kick the Honda pay driver Flopshow Yuki Soon-out-the door. And get an fresh face like Jehan in his seat. Don’t ruin Alphtauris credit by hiring that childish baby
Yuki is such a kid 😂
LETS GO YUKIII
Lando would've loved growing up here in the states. You can the tell the dude likes to have a good time.
Love this video! Now that is How To Have Fun Outdoors!
Great 😉
Very good
How did Max lose the final but still end up the driest person there?
“GP, did you hydrate during the race?”
The only time where Yuki gets to pass Max lol
Ah lokos
Should of done the whole figure 8  Max would of defo won Jus run out of track.
They’re called Swamp Buggies … not Swamp Cars stupid
This should be a series. Pro athletes competing in sports that isn’t their own.  You could call it, “Comfort Zone”.
max's face while drivig is gold haha
bruh this is my first day on god's green earth that i have seen this thing thats a racecar on water🤣🤣🤣
Max pulled one of his clasic F1 overtakes there
I know this is a fun race but i teally do think that one day Yuki will be fighting at the top, i mean pushing his Alfatauri to some good plsces has been really impressive for a young driver like him. Hopefully he gets promoted to a good team soon.
The funny thing is the trohpy was Almost the same height as yuki
Max didn't aim for first place, Max aimed for staying dry.
where my boy checo!
5:18 literally so cute
Funny... you can see how little Max was into it... And he raced so he wont be wet at the end.... he didnt care
when I was younger we used to use old vw beetles and fill every gap with spray foam and make paddle tires they float so well lol.
And they said American Ingenuity was dead. Who's laughing now?
This well depicts big Yuki energy.
Max already on the radio complaining about Yuki into T1 "dude he cannot just pop a wheelie like that it's so dangerous"
I just hope that was a man made swamp where no animals live
🤣🤣
The trophy was almost as big as Yuki 🤣
The skate kids drive their asses off
So this is Florida man?
At the start of the video.. “Wait is that Jett Lawrence?” Pretty cool
How have I never heard of this? This is so sick
🤣yuki catwalk that thing pretty crazy
"You will get wet" Max: nah
WTFF They came to my home town when I wasn’t there,!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Pretty sure the white buggy is waaay faster on straights. Wish they switched them in the final.
Imagine Max vs Daniel for this one.
I love how Max took the racing line
Watch out for the crocs max.
next season f1: verstappen in alphatauri, tsunoda in red bull
Verstappen and his slow starts
Looks like Yuki is wasted in F1 honestly.
Only in America man!
The Cringe is strong in this one
Really hope Yuki gets a seat in a top team someday. Awesome personality and electric racer, he just gotta become more consistent
THAT TROPHY IS ALMOST AS BIG AS YUKI IS
all redbull content is out of world
i love how u.s. americans like everything BIG. even that trophy is the size of yuki xD
I think the Devil Max won!
I'm in Canada, we don't have swamp buggies, we have snowmobiles, and the greatest snowmobile racers were Gilles Villeneuve and his brother, Jacques Sr. (well maybe not anymore, but I'm old...)
Max is like. "this is silly...but I'm gonna win!"
It's lovely to watch the greatest F1 driver of this generation along with Max to have some fun driving swamp buggys
The only time yuki will ever beat max in a race 👍
Red bull lagi
Does Matt ever smile
more exciting  than a f1 race
Never thought I'd see F1 drivers racing swamp buggies but cool nonetheless! Glad they enjoyed it.
Yuki enjoying being infront of Max lol
Yeah...Yuki is fearless.
Finally, Yuki is faster than me ゆうきは僕よりふぁやい😵‍💫😵‍💫
Wow Red Bull is capping the crap out of the us gp
Yuki take off on the first race on purpose to simulate what it's like to be in a Mercedes in 2022.
This kinda thing is exactly why I cheer for y'all on Sunday
I wonder if Yuki would be good at drag racing... like look at him, the dude was insane
Do they still have the sippi hole?
Yuki’s a madman in that thing 😂
Que chido
Too much closeups. It's impossible to see the entire track at once.
As a Floridian this is a lot better than F1 >:)
Great video from redbull !!!
Max always has this "You got me but you know I'm coming for you" look on his face.
Yuki saying it’s not a good idea, and then drives like never before…
What kind of yuppie still wearing a mask here in Florida? Tragic....
What is aquaplaning?
Yuki's crazy! :))))
It’s funny because it looks like max is there with his son yuki lol
Yuki you are the world champion
Looks like fun
Yuki, Pierre, Sergio, and Max should participate in a Formula SAE race.
I see them all the time they are usually Chevy  lmpalas. With nice paint jobs..
𝓗𝓲
Where is checo?
Next racer Cleetis McFarland...
Porpoising at 3:45?
Did the guy say "Max VerstaBBen" at 0:07? lol
stop vestagay , mais ou sont les vrais pilotes ??
Redbull😍🇦🇹
why does max look like ken miles with the sunglasses lol
First heat, Max just running inside racing lines
2:18 what a max style divebomb
Max just can’t help but to late brake lol. He thinks that roller coasters brake too soon for corners.
Max stays with the cold stone killer look even in a swamp race
V8 modorrr
I cant believe this exists, loved it, now i want to try one😂
Only here for Jett Lawrence
I love yuki
Yuki really fast. Amazing!
Wold prob still beat Hamilton this year
Tsunoda faster than Max confirmed. 😂
Best we have ever seen Max. Maybe he is human after all.
Finally, Miami GP marina
Zion, max, and yuki technically coworkers
Proof that Yuki in equal machinery is better than Max.
I admit: Americans know how to have fun.
This is why I love redbull💙Keep inviting Zion for these!! Being F1 fan but also a skater made me crack up when zion got dusted by max😂
I remember watching this growing up in the 90s. As a kid. Nothing  on TV at the time was like this. Never thought I would be seeing it still going 20 +years later .
Max didn't want to get wet lol
Yuki beat max in the sister RB. That's a headline
Hopefully MV get snapped up by Alloygater!
Max when driving went 😐
How did a skateboarder get involved in this.. just weird
Big ups to Zion Wright. Much love for him
Max face when he loses damn dude it's just for fun
Next time we get flooded track in F1, this is the answer
Don't forget to warm the tyres before the first corner  Max
Zion just freaking out 😂😂😂👌
Me wanna go!!!!!!
how embarrassing
I want to see Red Bull with no paint and reliable car win 2022 championship.
Formula 1 in my hometown?! No way!
max trying to scare yuki as he said the car does a wheelie while accelerating   yuki actually driving on two wheels 👁👄👁
proof yuki can beat max with same spec car
02:21 Why did this overtaking remind me so much of Interlagos 2016, against Rosberg?
I miss growing up in the 80s when you could watch swamp buggy racing on TV. I think it was on TNN?
I think we know what Yuki might do next if F1 doesn't work out as planned
I love how max managed to find a racing line in that thing.😂😂🔥
Well I guess swamp cars works better than swap planes ;)
F1 BABY!!!!
Will we have porpoising? Maybe just Aliigatoring!
Yuki it's vin Diesel
I bet Michael Masi is hiding underneath one of those swampy rocks!!
zion and max in the same video? 😮
That was interesting lived in Naples those races are crazy loud
We all know max didn't send it in the last round cause he doesn't want to get wet 🤣🤣🤣
OK... Normally I'm not into (obvious) marketing gags/events. But I have to admit: you got my attention 😅
We need Max or Yuki in some gymkana stuff with Travis and ken
Yuki: how fast are these? Max: ~300kph Yuki: really?? Max: no lol
遊び心全開で面白い！　Playful and entertaining!
Max don't wanted to get wett so he did not go full throttle
=WHY NOT MUD BOGGING??........IT'S WAY MUCH MORE FUN,TO SAY AT LEAST  ........AND THESE SWAMP CARS--NEVER HEARD OF THEM
You can't look at Yuki and not start smiling. What a happy man he is
yuki is good boy.
Max didn't get wet once during this. He's done so many of these PR activities at this point, I think he's losing some enthousiasm for them.
Yuki manda bem dms, drift na água
how is a skateboarder supposed to compete with an f1 champion
😂
BREAKING NEWS: "MAX VERSTAPPEN TO RETIRE FROM FORMULA 1 TO JOIN THE SWAMP BUGGY CHAMPIONSHIP 2022"  Man, they gonna make a real Florida Man outta Max :P
Lol. All film with his iPhone's vertical.
this is the most florida thing ever
Zion Wright!!!
I’d imagine there is very little difference between a Florida man and an Aussie man 🤔
3:20 EPICCCCC
I  just really love how redbull always upload cool and challenging video that's why redbull is something special for me❤️
I think these things must be the best thing about working for redbull racing. good luck  today and sunday boys  another 1 2 would be amazing
Max Yuki bants = 🔥
Unfortunately Masi wasn’t around to fix it for Max* this time around.
Good place for max , keep him there!
Yuki Tsunoda you are the world champion, world champion
They should put yuki in the Red Bull f1 car for that beat down 😂
Yuki is a better driver than max.
Yuki was born to do this
I'm proud of max Verstappen especially because he is dutch 😏
ok
Yuki was like ‘this is my big chance, got to smoke Max’ 🤣 FairPlay. Redbull is an awesome brand 🔴🐂
Tsunoda is so annoying. Idk but I don t want him in f1. Neither skill or personality
Bonifay said Yuki is nuts, there's no better compliment from someone like him.
How is Max not wet ?!!
Just Redbull doing Redbull things
I think size matters
In near future, "Yuki Tsunoda beats Max Vestappen and wins, an F1 world championship!!!!!!!!"
Red bull stinking lying crooks
Yuki my new idol 🤩🚀
2060 formula be like
2:21 when you are on the lead but you cant handle the g force when turning 🤣🤣🤣
In equal car tsunoda is better than verstapen 👀
There ain't no FAA in these swamps 😂
This will be the ONLY time Yuki will beat Max…   That looked like a blast! I hope those boys enjoyed it as much as we did.
Yuki clear of max crashtappen
Ah yes the flying dutchman
You know that Max absolutely hated losing.
Wild...so funny to see the F1 cats doing it on the water!
マックスの屈託ない笑顔だけでも、この動画に価値がある。
Max, Yuki, and Jett need to go watch Zion session a 12 stair handrail and really get their minds blown!  It would be cool to get these Redbull athletes to do more stuff like that.
Wait until Helmut finds out about the result
Inside corner has advantage..
Ahora Yuki Tsuda el chiquito de tamaño, se sentirá grande y va a querer el primer asiento en Red Bull! 😁
Yuki's so smol, I wonder if that's why his buggy was so keen to wheelie.
videos like these is why i love red bull ❤️❤️
Yuki Toreto ? 😂👌
0:13 That's what my dog does if he wants to go for a pee pee 😂
Yuki smoked Max :v
may be the only race that yuki can win max
As with anything RBR rated, rigged.
What a waster of a good 900HP engine :D
Confirm Yuki won the biggest trophy this weekend!! That thing is huge!
I loved seeing that too much talking black dude getting washed off by Max without even a smile 😂 and still couldn’t stop talking bullshit.
I’m gonna be concerned the day latifi tries this out
Я что один русский тут?
Yuki Tsunoda Dominic Toretto, No Difference!
The reaction time of these guys is amazing
God I wish my hair was as nice as Yuki's
When I was a child I tried to call red bull and get them to sponsor my dad's swamp buggy, maybe they finally got to my voicemail 🤣
Yes! Yuki Win!! very happy! from japan
Yuki with that wheel stand was amazing
Max took that very seriously… looking at his face racing’ 😎
Yo I love seeing Zion there.
ヽ(*⌒∇⌒*)ﾉ unbelievable, very good your videos.
is no one gonna talk about how locked in max's face is.
So nice to see Jaegar not get mentioned😂
If F1 teams was to investigate Ferrari and Haas. Investigate Red Bull and Alpha Tauri too.
I want F1 guys to ride moto gp bikes😝
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😊😊😊😊😊😘😘😘😘
Only in Florida
Verstappen is always stuck up. Must not be fun to be in the same F1 whatever as a driver, mechanic or any other position...
Put them guys inside of a 410 Winged Sprint Car... betcha they'd love it
Looks a lot of fun
As a Floridian, yes. This is what we do in our free time.
Whoa! I didn't expect to see one Parks Bonifay, professional wakeboarder and one huge party thrower from the Gulf Coast of Florida! They used to throw some big parties back in the day! 🤙🏼🤙🏼 Florida, the only place it can really stay lit from Friday afternoon until early Monday morning!
Plot Twist, Max quits Formula1 and gets into Speedboat racing😎
Loved the camaraderie…and the crazy racing!
Mode tug Max activet
when the equipment is all the same 😂 😂
Super dope.. this is what will help f1 in America on the low
Tsunoda,Gasly,Peres,Alonso  e Masi vs 44 ,I hope the champion this year deserves it!
Yuki’s English is really improving at the same rate as his race craft & mentality. Great to see it!
Once upon a time ESPN used to show the Swamp Buggy races....now they have Sports Talk Shows.
I see that for nice events (either F1 on NY streets or SwampBuggyes) it's not hybrid V6 with fuel limitations... It's just V8 pure raw power. Sooooo nice. It's music for my ears! ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻
Gotta love how Max still managed to stay dry
Yuki is now a certified FLORIDA MAN
I love it! Yuki with the huge wheelie 😏💪 Red Bull❤️💪
Max is hilarious giving him the lead just to come back with ease 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
いぇーい
That trophy was the size of Yuki!
LOL, I love the serious look on Max's face, and how he stepped out dry ... Yuki's launch was brilliant also
we need more swamp racing content thank you very much
And jett lawrence🍻
so having a drag strip and creating the demon was never enough for Amrecicans......let alone nascar......so every decade you guys get bored of what you have......
Man, I remember when Parks was a small little kid skiing with us, his brother and his mother when we would come to their place on the lake.. how time flys.
F1 World Champion got smoked by a future restaurant owner.
Yuki really sucks in F1 I’m sure Jehan will replace his sorry seat next year. Yes Jehan Daruvala
Yuki would have a much better career doing this.
Damn that final race was great! But really max didn't do no effort to catch up since he don't wanna get wet all the way catching yuki and yet the winner get wet all the way.💯😆👍
Seems really dangerous in a rollover
OPEN DRS?
Damn, Yuki went balls deep from the get go. He'd fit right in in Florida!
Now that's proper porpoising!
cringe
Dude, being part of the Red Bull team (any sport) must be a dream come true!
The only time Yuki will ever beat Max
You can't beat the sound of a V* with open headers
Yuki is too fast, max never had chance!
Yuki gave her the beans off the bat hammer dahn little man.
i thought this was a replay of spa 2021
Muy bien YUKIE!!!!!!! Very sound driving.
Did you see the look on Max's face? Put a wheel in his hand and he goes all business.
Jett Lawrence in Florida racing swamp buggies a few days before Salt Lake City wasn't expected. Did Redbull fly him in just for this video?
They only race Yuki won over Max.
Finally yuki can faster than max
this is insane!
That's my boy Yuki!
Yuki!!
Max didn’t want to get wet at all in the final
No Checo, no like!!!
LETS GOOOOO NAPLES REPRESENT
Hey, so as a Floridian in the middle of all of this going on can yall tell me when you're coming to town haha
Swamp buggy racing! Every Sunday morning on TNN when I was a kid. Cool but ridiculous
who needs a world champ in the red bull, get yuki in the main team
Yuki went for that wheelie straight away haha
oh my god it's incridibble😍😍
Yuki's totally buying one of those.
redbull F1 and the supercross guys need to do more collabs
I love Max Verstappen's positive attitude.
Max: Easy win for me.  Yuki: Hold my 🍻🍺🍺
See what happens when you put them in the same machine!!
Dude I haven't seen parks in a long time. Good to see he still with redbill
I didn’t realize Yuki could fit in my pocket 😮😂
This is probably how the felt driving in Spa last year
this is a certified florida classic
lol max didnt crash yuki out how nice of him
Samurai Style! Cut right trough the Water
Now this is porpoising!!!
Yuki out here pulling wheelies 🤣
OK now I want a whole series of RB athletes from all different disciplines competing in an Olympics-style decathlon of weird sports I've never heard of. I'm gonna bet the farm on Pastrana winning it
Yuki for world champion?
Knowing Jett, I thought he'd win this for sure! Surprised he had time to come film this... I guess when you wrap up your championship early, you have more free time
Yuri when he won the final: LOOK AT ME, I'M THE NEW RED BULL DRIVER
Yuki it’s crazy 😂😂😂
OMG 😅 redefining the comment " there is too much spray, I can't see" 💦
F1 drivers in cup cars next?
So there you go Pirelli, you can make the wheels big and narrow for the 2060 Miami GP in case it´s flooded by then.
Max cutting on the inside on turn 1 - Things that you like too see Max do
Yuki literally just sends everything. He knows no fear.
where are gasly and perez
Max is getting demoted to AlphaTauri after that loss
Wouldn’t be Jett if he didn’t break something😂
Okey Max is pissed now
jesus Yuki just sent it straight out the gate lmao
What climate change?
i love how redbull ata any place they go they also have other pro athletes
Max the whole race: 😐 Yuki: 🤩😊🥹😄😁
Max hit that apex tho
I'm glad to see that this sport is still around! I use to watch these on TV, as a kid! Then they just kinda dwindled out! I've always loved this sport! Hopefully it will be around for many more years!
Hold my red bull
I'm a racer an when I first saw a swamp buggy I just laugher....u definitely have to tell ur grand kids about this....max haha
Been American since I was born, done did never known this be existed.
Give an F1 pilot something with wheels
Wheels is wheels. 👍👍
Hell yeah, I love that! 😍❤️
OMG Yuki 🤯
Can ypu make donuts with this thing
Song name in the background?
Yuki is like a young gullible boy, love the energy in this video.
Go max
Yuki would beat Max in spec series - confirmed
Very surprised Max didn't crash into Yuki
These guys should try jet boat racing
Man I used to watch these race on TV back in the 80's maybe 90s when I was a  kid! I didn't even realize they still raced them! I never hear about them anymore lol!
Yuki was having too much fun lmao
Max and Jet are my Favourite races in both SX MX and F1  🇳🇱🇦🇺🤙
This is a certified hood classic
No drs? Verstappen lose? Omg 😳
Did max always drive with this face ? Man is driving with IDC 😑 GIGACHAD energy!
Hell yeah zion
I remember watching this a very long time ago on tv, damn I don’t remember they looked like this at all. Not sure why I haven’t heard or seen anything about swamp buggies since then
Stagiaire, je bent iets vergeten in de titel.
forget about the dodge demon these are the real boats
Woop! Naples
This proves it. Yuki > Max. I knew it.
Max looks like he's got PMT   😡
Gooooo Team Alpha Tauri!!! 🔥🔥
This is very nice,I enjoyed seeing Max,good luck to Redbull this weekend on the Miami GP.❤
Yuki and max in equal cars and yuki wins? Coincidence? Prolly not
Yes Yuki
3:20 I see Alpha Tauri hasn't figured out porpoising yet.
I like it Picasso
I think i like max ( after that sketchy 2021 horner -massi season i wanted him to beat lewis but he didnt ! The beaurocracy did ) he actually is giving a good energy out there .
Stone faced max lmaoooo
Yuki to redbull when?
in F1 we have slip streams. here, theirs jet streams
Now to wait and see who gets dysentery from all that nasty water blowing in their face and mouth!
Its funny how the trophy is almost as big as yuki himself
I could totally hear 'Yuki you are the world champion!'
Now I want to see what happens if Yuki goes against a real swamp buggy racer. Just curious how the Japanese would compare
Siiiiickkk
This is lit 🔥
Max seemed more concerned with staying dry.
I'm not brothered if all teams switch to swamp buggy cars on Sunday !
FIA: "Redbull why did we lose millions of fans to swamp racing?" Redbull: "don't know what you talking about". (makes nevous eye contact with alpha tauri)
the trophy is almost as big as Yuki
Ricciardo traded this in to be emasculated in crop tops
Once again, Max gets beaten on the Start. That is the only weakness he has.
Smart max, 2:20, he knew the other guy was gonna go wide in the corner so he waited and went through on the inside. There’s a reason he’s f1 champ
Yuki to RedBull 2023 confirmed 😃
Ah! Pero como se aburren
what a sport, not only do you lose if you come second, you end up wet
That was nice from vers!! Letting the other guy win!!! Let’s go red bull!!!!!!
Ouais! Dans un monde où la Russie n'attaquerait pas l'Ukraine, je trouverais ça rigolo, fun, amusant et/ou divertissant. Là je trouve ça des plus déplacé au point de vue de la communication de Red Bull !!!
Love it
Please say semi correctly
That wheelie out of Yuki was filthy lol
It makes me so happy to see Yuki beat Max!
If this whole F1 thing doesn’t pan out Yuki definitely has a future here 🤌🏻
Yuki adds another career option post F1
F1マシンの開発のヒントを得たりして(・∀・)
Never thought I'd see a buggy that big lmao loved it
Yuki ya sabe donde competir si no le dan asiento en la f1
Love it! A bit a florida race culture that usually goes under the radar. Love the F1 liveries on the buggies 😭
Yuki just sent it first try🚀
Go on jett
Those tires are new, to me. Skinnies and discs, ala salt flats, for much less drag, and in the corners. Good stuff. 632cid? or BB anyway. It's what I like for low-end grunt.
Take max out of the redbull and replace him with Yuki obviously he is a lot quicker and max only can win dirty
WOW, I am pleasantly surprised RedBull let their athletes risk injury or death racing in the water on these wild crazy machines.
another red bull DNF this season
Max needed Masi there in the end but he wasn't there :{
wasnt expecting to see Zion Wright hanging out with Verstappen and Yuki. My two passions combined!
I worked near here for a week but never knew about this!
Badass haircut
My pops GF in the 80s came from a swamp buggy racing family.
I don't like verstappen personality,  is arrogant and enjoy embarrassing people, like humiliate, mmmm I like as driver but as human is a bull$hit
Looks like Yuki has a back up race series he can get into if F1 doe's not pan out LOL.
Haha, the trophy is of the same height as Yuki 😂
Miami-Madness. Crazy-Cool
Gooooo Yukiiiiiiiii 🏁
Jet Lawrence lol
That looks incredibly fun
Red Bull is legit pumping out the best content with its drivers right now! Love these guys.
Yuki should get a better F1 car now since he beated max 😂😂
I live in Florida and never seen these racing buggies , looks super fun
Welcome to America baby!
Us American's find the craziest things to race 😂... just put a motor in it lol
I don’t think max got one drop of water on him
I mean just flood the whole miami gp circuit and give every driver one of those swamp things and the whole f1 race would be a lot more entertaining.
Other teams should be doing cool concepts like this…if McLaren did it I would watch them.
Red bull boat broke down too lol
*Yuki the Pocket Rocket*
Parks Bonifay! He is on Nitro circus some if it's the same guy haha, Travis Pastrana's cousin.
It's really annoying to watch everyone holding phones up all of the time.
BADASS! I WANT!!!
This looks like a blast
Max: Calm and composed  Yuki: DID I SEND IT? OR DID I DON'T DIDN'T SEND IT? AAAAH SEND IT!
3:29 Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the new meme for races with a lot of rain.  😂
Why does yuki's car have so thin tires, but Max' car had these additional things
Max's face... "this got wheels, I am gonna care"
The white buggy was way faster in general
Yuki born for sirve this things
Where did this come from? I live in Florida and nothing like this is popular. Somehow they are sponsored by red bull....... This seems like they just made this up. NOBODY in Florida knows of this place. This is not average Florida man things HAHA
Yuki showed his inner Florida man and did somehow a wheelie
It’s crazy to think how f1 drivers deal with heavy steering normally, and to the normal person a swamp buggy is probably very hard to turn but it’s cool how f1 drivers make it look so easy to steer in the first race
Swamp Buggy: accelerates Yuki: *WHEELIE*
Max should have removed the paint off buggy cause it was overweight compared to Yuki
Yuki, king of the swamp!
Yuki Cheated, those buggys don't have weight limits (Yuki Stole the Race)
That was awesome. Smiled watching the entire thing. Great work everyone.
Max taking the inside line like he usually does, love this video Red Bull.
The duo we didn't know we needed ❤🔥🔥🔥
ZION!!!!
I have no idea what these things are, but they sure look like a lot of fun 👀
Even in this fun environment, I can see the fierce competitiveness on Max's face. You can also tell how much he loves racing and cars, he's so into everything
Yo Red Bull, Alpha Tauri.  You never cease to amaze. You did the Alpine trucks... What about MonsterTrucks next? :)
*2023 Red Bull and Alphatauri f1 cars leaked*
swamp GP naw
Yuki to Red Bull confirmed
This was a really cool red bull vid keep these up
RB Drivers have the most fun of anyone on the grid; guaranteed.
Max soaked him, thats hilarious.
2:25 AND IT’S A LATE LUNGE BY VERSTAPPEN! WHO TAKES THE LEAD OF THE RACE!
Red Bull is the coolest F1 team
Keep showing cool sports that are barely published in the media. It shows how much Redbull actually cares about sports
Here I am thinking I saw everything. And then I've seen swamp buggy.
I think that Yuki has found him yet another sport to play in
角田のコミ力が異常　タッペン攻略したかどうか知らんけど F1ドライバーの友人大杉 少なくとも１／５程度は攻略した模様（笑）
Didn’t even know this was a thing
How are redditors hating on America when America does this ? Glad to see cheese burger bois having a grand time.
Good win for yuki
This is awesome!
Looked like Max had a gear sync issue at the start. He went for the long run anyway, no biggie.
How about a Redbull swamp buggy series
Yuki beating the reigning world champ and winning a trophy that's taller than him😂😂🙌🏻
Only time Yuki will beat Max in anything!
Ok, that was fun! Yuki Tsunoda should have a good fallback in case F1 doesn’t work out!
Yuki out here pushing the Alphatauri to its limits... again.
Funny how Verstappen is known to be good in the wet 😆, "The boy just finds grip wherever he goes ".
Max… let’s let yuki through. He is not our race max let’s not hold him up.
First Yuki`s Trophy Whie in Formula 1????
About the only way Yuki is gonna beat Max!!! Hahahaha I'll bet his butt was puckering during that wheelie!!! Mad fun!  Red Bull gets all the COOL points 👉
Jett Lawrence got a proper Red Bull Powertrain Engine :D Nice video!
Max serious face when he races get me everytime
Yuki knows no fear
Or we can stop Americanizing a world-wide brand and therefore diluting what it means to be bigger than the American market
Smol drives big
Yes Yuki!!! He has became one of my favorites. 🥹
Max FOUND THE GRIP xd
The best race drivers in the world.... Filming vertically... The human species is doomed.
😍
👍🔥💪❤
Wow I guess Max and Yuki really got the taste of an average Florida man's life...
you already know cleetus mcfarland gonna get into this 😂
It's official, Yuki retiring as an F1 driver, starts swamp buggy racing, becomes all time great.
Now you know why they're F1 drivers.
Did not expect to see Zion in a video with Max and Yuki but I am all here for it
Imagine Lewis vs Max. Would be an akward video instead.😅😅
Maybe we should put yuki on a red bull
Would these be road legal with lights turn signals? Asking for a friend...
Good speed Tsunoda
Max's face while racing is just so concentrated and serious like 🗿
Can’t believe F1 came to my hometown! Been to these same stands before! Would love to have seen this in person
This proves it.  Great drivers drive ANYTHING well.  Way to go, Yuki!
Yuki SENDING it off the line like 🔥🔥🔥
The best dang marketing team on the planet
Yuki next world champion 👁👁
I heard Yuki is quitting F1 to become a Swamp Buggy pro
Yuki is better than Max?! I see mid-season driver change
While we have Red Bull, we'll have Nice and funny sports moments
Max didn't got wet...
Man, Yuki became a Florida man really quickly 😂
It’s gotta be so cool to be a Red Bull athlete. They had producers from my favorite podcast jumping out of plane and doing flips in helicopters this week in Miami. Why? No idea, it’s Red Bull.
Ok now give Yuki max’s seat
Awesome vid! Sucks Jett didn't really get a shot at it
Again bad starts by rb in sprint races.
The only time Yuki will be ahead of Max, for now.
Can you imagine racing a world champion.......bucket list has been cleared completely.
Max was joking about wheelies, yuki almost backflipped 😂 that looks like alot of fun
Yuki is nutty bro.
Glad to see some actual Florida stuff, not Miami
Surprised they didn’t go see Garret at the freedom factory. Do it for dale
Only in Florida can’t believe Yuki won.
Team RED BULL going to dominate swamp buggys like they dominated Dakar with Kamaz?   I don’t see why not🤔
Yuki Tsunoda 2023 WDC
Miami RB 1-2 🤘🫡🫡
Like seeing F1 and swamp buggies combining together here
And all the bass in the pond are going. What The Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissssssh!
Yuki Thanks for the nice race. Good luck in Miami GP!
This is proof that every problem can be solved with raw horsepower ...
Jett Lawrence the long lost brother of Shawn Mendes
Loved Max’s look with his dark glasses and very focused 😅
this gives me imola vibes...
Yuki Future WDC confirmed.
Max face with no expression while driving had me laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Yuki legend
thats RED BULL...YESS N.C.MORE NICE DAY TO ALL
And there is the proof Tsunoda is superior.
I know Max is good in the wet, but even you'd agree this is a bit too wet hahahaha
Tsunoda overdrive that buggie unsurprisingly
not the everglades & not a swamp buggy
Think about swamp bugging like this , formula 1 racing in deep water that if you swim in ur likely to get bugs all over you
Jet always with the shirt off🤣🤙🤙 Oi Oi Oi
The fact that the trophy was almost as tall as yuki lmao
The aston martin's are looking kinda different in miami aren't they?
Max can find a race line in any element 🤣
I was expecting Bert Kreischer to show up here..
F1 needs more of this!
the fact that max managed to stay dry, is amazing
These guys are so good in main quest (F1) they're now doing side quests.
Okay, this is cool. Red Bull always deserves an engagement comment for the Algorithm.
"Americans are good at making boring sports fun" - Jeremy Clarkson :D Great video guys :)
And now Yuki is dead to Max.
yuki wheelying and going crazy, lol the trophy is almost as big as him
-Yuki "I don't think this a good idea"  -But why Yuki? -Yuki *pops wheelie*   "Im juuuuuust tooooo siiiiiick"
BRUTAL ...
10/10 content
Divertido esse esporte
did not expect Yuki to have this crazy driving style
Red Bull is the king of marketing bar none 🤘
Was gonna say they spelled swap wrong, but they weren't lying
Max verstappen Brazil 2016 be like
now I kinda wanna see Yuki in a muscle car, that was pretty fast and the furious sh*t .
Oh heeeeelllll yeah
Y'all are doing an excellent job getting me hyped for the race in Miami. Never knew F1 would be so close to home. Very exciting.
Of all the sports you could of shown off..... this was an awesome pick.
This is awesome But it will be the only time yuki beats max
Sick!!!
The Floridians are at it again
Well damnit put Uki in a RB lets see what he can do lol
Jettson... Noooo
Put the boys in some 410 sprint cars, give em a handful!
Equal cars
why does parks look 70 yrs old? cocaine must be a serious drug.
😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣 this is Red Bull... They know how to get fun time
Did Max even get wet, amazing water control...
Incase anybody ever wonders why Red Bull has the following it has, this is it. They do all these cool things and we get to see their drivers getting to be kids and we get to experience excitement vicariously through the team we cheer for.
Max been blessed with everything but a normal face
The new pinnacle of PR: New marketing plan has Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Alpha Tauri rebranded under single entity to be known as “Torro Tacky.”
La cara de Max, es de competencia,, siempre ser el mejor.
O boca de tilápia
I like how Max is taking it so serious...look at that focused face😂
Definitely some florida ish
Max's idea of fair play had to surface at the end
When the trophy is bigger than you
I'm going to write a 30 page Letter to the FIA to make this a thing
yuki!! i live in naples and cant believe these 3 legends where here. Good luck to them in miami!
No way I thought they were gone forever! I love swamp boogies. Never seen one in real life though. I used to watch this racing back when I was a kid. Sunday morning CMT started out with fishing and then ended with motorsports. I thought about these things just the other day wondered if people still did it.
nice wheelie for yuki lol
Give Yuki same car as Max, he could beat Max in F1 race.
Breaking: tsunoda to replace verstappen at Red Bull from 2023
Max : Dont mind me driving like a pro bro , while Yuki is driving that damn swamp car like riding on a bull or a horse , the final lap was like watching a father - son moment for Max and Yuki , while Yuki was celebrating he totally got soaked by awesome dad Max wat a comeback
Max is so carful then Yuki is just sending it 😂
way too much drugs in america...
Yanks are terrible at sports even the ones they made up they still get rolled 🤣🤣
It's funny watching Trump supporters acting like they're not racist
Póngale subtitulos en español !!!!
I wasn’t expecting Jett Lawerence in this video considering he literally just won his Supercross title but that’s badass seeing him in some Redbull stuff with the F1 guys
They should add off track mini games like this in f1 2022
Make Franz proud😂😂😂
max flooded him after the finish line, it seems familiar
Redbull quite literally just winging it and i love every moment of it
I love seeing these type of videos because it shows how talented f1 drivers are
As an American I have no clue what I just watched
Red Bull always has something fun prepared for us 😎
That looks incredible!! I wanna do that too
Yuki doing the damn thang!  I'm like Max, I never knew this existed, and I live here.
beautiful Parks. USA Florida baby.
Yuki just locked in his 2023 Red Bull seat with that win.
Always good seeing the Red Bull team having fun.
Didn't even know Swamp Buggies existed until now hahahah Looks awesome
Yuki > Max confirmed 😂
Que loucura interessante
Marko: whoever wins the second round will get a seat in Redbull next year. Yuki: Hold my Sushiii
Wow Well done Yuki!
Max taking turns like nothing
Yuki bought this to all champions 😂😂
“That was absolutely clinical, Yuki.”
Yes! Bring skaters and F1 drivers together more! My 2 favourite things!
To be fair, Yuki and Max weren't exactly slow. I could see them competing for overall wins in Swamp Buggy racing.
Equal cars yuki better? 😀
Yuki crushing it
red bull
They should have let them run the full course they cut it down by a half a lap
Thanks for making a stop here from Miami, swamp buggy racing has been a massive way of life here in Naples. We have a swamp buggy parade down off 41 that goes by 5th ave. A lot of buggy’s are home made and have very interesting engines. Everyone local shows up fire, police, rotc, national guard,civil air patrol and companies show up to toss out candy to the children amongst other items. They either drive the buggy’s in the parade or trailer them down the road. How could I forget they would do a swamp buggy queen contest and the winner gets to do something special.
No wonder max is a champ, he put his race face on BIG TIME for this lmao
This is such a banging vid😂
Yuki: im going to beat the world champion  Max: I’m just trying to stay dry
Famous people no mask. Hired help must have a mask on. Trust the Science
YUKI TO RB CONFIRM LMAOO
A 4th DNF for the RED BULL team there. Seems like they’re struggling with reliability issues😂😂
Now i want to try it!
Proud Florida Man right here 🐊
crazy. more such videos 👌👍👍
Yuki decided to embrace the Dominic Torretto.
The trophy Is Taller Than Yuki. 😄😄😄
I would love to do that
theese things sound wild... better than f1 lawnmower engines...
Is there a league for this swap racing? Is it on youtube/instragam?
Max's face on this while driving, is the funniest thing ever.
Cleetus McFarland buys one of these, blows it up and rebuilds it with turbos and nitrous in 5..4..3..2..
Hold on, that's Parks Bonifay?! When did he turn into Sammy Haggar?
I just think Max didn't want to get wet
I really want to see f1 drivers in nascars
Well Yuki  beats the world champion max in a swamp Buggy Race
To bad they did not get them to race jeep class too . Slow race and then the bumping on each other to get by - Thats is right up Max's alley - then driving down into the deeper  sippy hole .  To bad they did not trust them to run the full course  in the big buggy's .
Amazing !!! haha
Year verry good Very good Very Nice KKK.
Shoulda raced the master Parks
Yuki torero 😝
Yuki is nuts hahahaaa
Yuki trying to take over Max's seat for 2023
Max is so serious when driving lolol
ah to be a florida man racing my swamp buggy around florida.
This first heat was literally the 2021 F1 season…
what fun this was, congratulations Yuki, I love you guys let's go for a good result in Miami.
Where’s the swamp queen dunk into the swamp?
So when is the sim racing version coming out, This be amazing fun in VR, Even better in real, Never knew this was a thing until I seen this, Stock car on water, lol....
Verstappen is so smooth that he didn't even get wet.
You know Max was pissed that he lost. Lol
... OmG nitro circus is in the house!....
Yuki, it’s Christian..
Well dang , Yuki has a seat in my buggy any day lol
レッドブルとアルファタウリを日本から応援しています‼︎
F1 went full Florida for this trip
Lol, poor jett
yuki went off
When people say “Red Bull is a drink company” I just laugh because RB has done more for action sports & motorsports than any other brand on the planet.
The only time Yuki will pass Max
Yukiiiiii
lol Max just didn't want to get wet so he stayed far behind then soak Yuki after the finish line.
Go Max. Good luck on Sunday. If the car holds up there is no stopping Max on Sunday.
Max: calm and collected start Yuki: *pedal to the metal!*
Sure Max said I'll get you back on Sunday :)
Damn I wish I knew, zion Wright was in my town
now this is how you get Americans excited about formula 1 lol!
U can see max get that racer game face
Welcome to Florida.
Somehow I found max's 😐 expression the funniest part.
Exciting to see all of our favorite Red Bull athletes together!
When swamps need a motorsport...
Neat
FIA should check Yuki’s buggy to see if it’s turned up
Yuki is as WILD in the swamp as he is on an F! track!!!
Redbull cons. Being cool and sporty all the time
Yuki has too much rear end. : P
Max sitting there like it's the final race of the world championship lmaoo
Red bull gives Alpha Tauri the wings this time.
😳😳😳😲😲😲humans invent crazy sh**. ,👍👍😅
This is so awesome lol.  Love seeing this side of Max
All this promo for Miami is insane, and I’m loving every second of it lol
Good Ol' Naples
Yuki's racing in the wrong motorsport category 😂 If Yuki leaves F1 now he knows what to do next
Pulled the same move he did on Hamilton on that corner 😭🤣
Porsche: "We will race in F1 only if very specific requirements are met"  Red Bull: "We will race you on a circuit, on the streets, in a swamp, in the desert, as an airplane, falling from space, and all in one race ... blindfolded"
Swamp buggy racing is like only a Naples thing, few other places may have it, but it was invented here and it crazy to watch when they get going fast, I some of the guys building them, they put alot of money time and effort into these things, and every season you see them all go to the parts stores to prep the buggy’s or in the races run out to fix them between races, it’s actually a very fun cool race
Max and Yuki really do be having a sibling dynamic😂
What watch is Zion Wright wearing at 2:14
Yuki all gas no brakes
I was hoping they'd do some Florida stuff while in Florida but I didn't expect this!  It's such a "real Florida" institution and is so far removed from the glitz and gloss of Miami and the theme parks... I just wish they'd put them in the Jeeps too...
Yuki replacing Max for Miami GP
3:19 the time you're looking for.
Yuki is definitely gonna call Horner after this
I love how this parks dude reffers to himself as 'florida man'
Max kinda looked lowkey scared
Who ever has the more money to spend wins.
And after 2 laps max won the world championship
Yuki should side hustle with Swamp Buggies, that was pure natural talent 💯💯
yuki kicks in yo!!!!!!!!!!
See it’s just the car. Max can’t win with anything else but the best car . Stroll is the goattttttt💪💪💪💪
3:16  Yuki praying for his dear life 🙏
Max was in Tryhard mode, Yuki had fun.
Jajajajaja 😂✌🏻  i love when they make these.. come on red bull for an amazing weekend 💪🏻🤩🇲🇽🇳🇱❤️🙌🏻
You guys notice the almost zero side pods? It explains the porpoising.
Red Bull wants to dominate every competitive field don't they 🤣
It's a genuinely uplifting experience when 2 F1 drivers are presented with equipment like these swamp buggies and there appears to be a moment of shock/apprehension,  etc. Really made my Friday morning.   Now go find a demolition derby for Christian and Toto to participate in and find some Monster trucks for Stroll and Latifi!
Red Bull is hands down the best!
Um Parks or Sammie Hagar???
Poor Jett didn't even get to drive 😂
👍👍👍
Yuki's def had more power lol
My only complaint is that you guys didn't send 'em around the whole lap and through the sippy hole! Otherwise ya'all have experienced one of our favorite local sports.
Just a great concept and the video was just great
I love that other F1 drivers are all playing golf and stuff but the Red Bull team in general are always looking for ways to make their athlets interact in fun activities like this one!
So red bull decides to use the only asian driver on the grid for their marketing? Woke companies are complete libtards
LOL, doing everything possible to dumb things down to usa IQ levels.
Unfair race with Yuki and Verstappen due to major weight differences. LMAO
This was awesome
Max & Yuki 2023!
This is what happens when uncle Massi is not there to help max again .
"Yuki is nuts" sums it up 🤣
I had no idea Zion liked anything to do with motorsport, dude's even more sick now
i hope redbull drivers try Pacu Jawi (Buffalo Race) in west sumatera Indonesia someday
Yuki is always the best I love him. So naive jajajaja
the one time yuki can say he beat max 😂
How have they got max with these bums
Yuki se subió sin permiso de su mamá!
YUKI FTW :D can now say he beat Max!
3:39 Yuki knows what it’s like to drive the merecedes
only time Yuki is ever gonna beat Max in race
The trophy is the Yuki's height
I think Max was more concerned with not getting wet than winning xD
2:24  "the boy just goes and finds grip everywhere "
That trophy is as tall as Yuki 😅😅😅
Can I take a ride in one of those?  looks like a blast to ride in one of ‘em
Awesome to see Zion hanging with Max and Yuki. That's the power of Red Bull right there.
Max max max max
Que buena jugada de Super Max, lo mojo bien cañon jajajajaja 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was cool. And the Redbull boys are wild. Max was focused like a champ.
I can tell it's Florida cause it's sunny but at the same time you can still see stormclouds in the background, gulf coasters just know
These look fun i wonder how yuki was doing after this
lmao its funny because Yuki looks up to Max and Max is teasing him all the time. By the way in the beginning Max is filming the wrong way, film horizontally >.>
角田！　おまえは最高だよ！！　クレイジーだっ！！！！！
Doesnt matter what you race, racing with the F1 world champion is always amazing! And well done Yuki you crazy animal!
角田くんがマックスに勝ったり色んなレッドブルアスリートと交流してる姿見られて嬉しい！最高！👍
All I could hear in my head 2:15 SUPER MAX MAX MAX MAX SUPER SUPER MAX
Why do I feel Max slows down at the final straight just to avoid to get wet hahaha
楽しそうでなにより👍👍👍👍
Finally Yuki unlocked his full potential with the right car
Not a single phone in sight, just people living in the moment
Max just looks like the average dad
Yuki Florida swamp Cars 22x times wdc
You guys are just insane
Yuki, the greatest driver of all time
Yuki is an absolute mad lad
So pathetic seeing Floridians wearing masks outside because of political bullshit.
And this is why I love RBR/AT... they let the boys play 😁
This is great. Well done RBR media machine. Keep it up!
3:20 - Yuki thinking his in a Merc.
I think max was more worried about getting wet then wining the race🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:56 This porpoising is like a Mercedes' one.
The trophy is taller than Yuki 🤣
Max' got his gameface on!!!
Yuki was porpoising there at the start of the first heat 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Red Bull always makes me laugh and smile, you guys bring a lot of joy to people! Continue doing what you do please. Be safe and God Bless you all!
Max going down the inside
the fact that the trophy is bigger than yuki is very funny
Where we these in spa last year?
when your an F1 driver, I don't think anything other than an ACTUAL fighter jet or dragster car, where they would feel adrenaline or any sense of speed compared to being in an F1 car. that is wild! even max double checked the leaver to make sure it was all the way down as he thought "this seems too slow" lol
didn't think I'd see the day where Yuki would beat Max... now time to translate that to F1 :)
Need to put some RBPT in those Swamp Buggies !!
Yuki 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No wonder why he's called " the pocket rocket". I would love to see Checo too.
Max was not havin it on this morning Hahhahahahhaah. glad Yuki had fun tho
I like Max for saying things like "I don't know what to expect".
3:23 Example of porpoising
Yuki is demon!
Of course it's a V8, that's one of the most american things I've seen recently :-D
Would love to try it out 😍
I love how Max jokingly said "they wheelie", and Yuki actually sent it so hard that it wheelied
Look at little old Naples the 239 getting some love from RedBull
I want a friend like ziom wright who can hype things up
Yuki's low height giving him low drag
brah i came from the f1 stuff on this link and was hella surprised but in a positive way to see zion wright :D legend. completely forgot he rides for red bull aswell.
PROFESSIONAL JOB  💜 EXCELLENT SERVICE  ❤️ CONGRATULATIONS  💙 VVIP  🤎 HERO  🖤 FANTASTIC  💛 EXPERIENCE  ❤️ GOOD LUCK  🤎 NASEEEEER QATAR DAKAAAAR 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Very nice
Hopefully a sign of things to come on Sunday??? 😂😂
Drain the Swamp!
Is i just me or does max look a little culture-shocked 0:43
Cool man i was like is that Zion. Awsome skateboarder VS F1 driver
Yuki Wa Bokuyori Hayai !!!
Love seeing the other Red Bull athletes getting involved. I’m just mad the Foy boy was’nt there
Haha yes Yuki! You absolute mad man 🤣👍
Any company can do what redbull does... it comes down to the people who work for the company... most companies have douche bags working behind the scenes who are not interested in these types of activities
Yup they're definitely in florida😂
Lol Zion actually kept up with max pretty good for a little lol
The trophy being 70% of Yuki's size was marvelous!
The only race that yuki will beat max in this year. Lol. Super cool idea though.
Swamp peoples know how to have fun using this crazy machines
Crazy yuki💯💯💯💯
The fact that the trophy is taller than Yuki makes this video top tier. Violation 💀
This Verstappen and Tsunoda guys are good, you should consider them into the swamp buggy team
3:20 Front wheels lift 😱😱😱
When Yuki was ahead of Max I yelled "No Parks no that was so not right!!"
Yuki would be world champion in this! OMG THOSE WHEELIES!! 🔥🔥  His one actually did a wheelie omg! 😅 V8 900Hp 🤯🤯🐎🏇
How do you even get the idea for machines like this? 😂 I've never seen anything like it!
To be fair I WAS asking for a wet race
This proves one thing fosho, Yuki can smoke Verstappen in that RB18....
Footage of Red Bull preparations for Spa 2022.
If Yuki could do very well, he could get that Red Bull seat alongside Max or once Max leaves Red Bull for another team.
if max wins this weekend its def because of the swamp buggy seat time he got
I love how yuki just sends it
This is why I love Red Bull, all out on crazy fun stuff
So cool max let Yuki win
Breaking: Yuki Tsunoda replacing Max Verstappen in 2023
@Redbull and @alphatauri have Max and Yuki try a Publix Sub so they can become full Florida Men.
Verstappen literally doing the move that won him the championship to the first guy🔥🔥🔥
yuki is too cute to be true
3:23 Real Porpoising XD
Breaking news: Yuki Tsunoda will replace Max Verstappen in 2023 season after winning against him in a swamp car race.
This actually looks well fun😂
Florida things, Florida man and now Formula 1... That's too much Florida things!
TF are those americans doing there
that is probably the ONLY time he will beat MAx.  lol
didnt even know stuff like this existed but here we are
The thing that really cracked me up was Verstappen coming out of that thing perfectly dry and clean.
Max just wanted to stay dry so he let yuki win I think 😂😂
THE BOY JUST GOES AND FINDS GRIP EVERYWHERE ELSE!
Ayo yuki a thug
Yuki is awesome :D
Love that red bull still sponsors and shows love to the skateboarding community
Max is such a good sport. Lewis would never do this.
Zion wright chilling with f1 drivers is something I never thought I would see
Yuki has found a new hobby 🤣❤️
THis hould be a competition on its own. But what the heckk, yuki was flyyinngggg
Finally they started the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix
Yuki better f1 driver then max confirmed
Looks like alot of fun!! Need to try this soon
Nice to see Yuki becoming better
That looks really fun :)
"That was dangerous!"  - Lewis
Football teams: okay players, so you can't ski, bungyjump, drink, do any extreme sports that could cause injury or we'll terminate your contract.  F1: this
That looks like FUN!
Now this looks fun!!
Is the black guy there for the reactions? Lol
Great to see tsunoda
damn, they're really chilling with the F1 world champion
Legendary. Thanks for the content Mr Admin
Even the swamp buggy redbull has reliability issues 😭
Florida has been finished with the virus for over a year. How embarrassing to see the locals with their masks back on. BOOOO
Womp the swamp 😎
Semifinal 2: Yuki recreating porpoising on water.
"Is it dry enough for slicks yet?"
Redbull: "We like to have fun when we can" Alpha Tauri: "we tag along because were the brother team" McLaren: "We play Golf with the bulls. Theyre cool guys" Ferrari: "Fun is a lovely dinner and other nice little things" Haas, Williams, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Alpine: "You guys have fun?" Mercedes: "NEIN! VE MUST DRIVE UND BE SCHERIOUS!"
Yuki floored it and almost went flying. Love it
The trophy was almost as tall as Yuki
"And he takes the inside corner..." "Dangerous driving man..."
Me gusta concepto de Red Bull entreteniendonos con buenos comerciales buenos contenidos
Yuki took the porpoising to the next level.
Checo Pérez y Max al tomar Red Bull para que le salgan a las el domingo
Love how you put max behind a wheel and he is in full drive mode no matter what it is.
Yuki picked up on that quick!   That was so cool
0:06 Thats not just a f1 driver thats a f1 champion
Just saying, but why the thropy is almost as tall as Yuki himself
I love that the trophy was taller than yuki 😂
Belgian GP highlights
If all the formula 1 racers would play this, Yuki would be the world champion 😂
Yuki went full send
I love Red Bull
got Verstapened on T1
Shock suspension on water
we *really* need a show where you toss yuki into different race cars…    yuki runs top fuel drag racing, yuki runs nascar, yuki runs monster trucks etc
Finally Florida Man irl
Ok sold! Where do i get one and does it come with a swamp?
Shock- RB has reliability issues
Es la primera vez que veo esos Buggies, están geniales!
Just look at yuki !!!😂😂
I see these things also experience porpoising.
Breaking news Verstappen and Tsnoda pull out of GP due to contracting diphtheria
3:22 Yuki is porpoising almost as bad as Mercedes this season 💀
The one mostly dry wins.
Do a top fuel drag racing
Let's go drive some planes next
Trust the Aussie to break the thing 🤣🤣👍
That trophy was bigger than Yuki!
Max being Yuki's older brother is so wholesome lmao.
*Isn't it funny that Redbull use their spare time to make ridiculous fun bungie ride yet still managed to finish and compete at top two 😂*
Those things are cool. Yuki found how to control it in the second race!
Thanks Red Bull swamp buggies are a hidden gem
Helmut called after seeing this video. Max got demoted and Yuki got promoted.
I honestly didnt know this kind of racing existed but I f*cking love it!
Look at Yuki go!!!! My man is a secret Florida man in disguise. Boys got a future swamp buggy racing.
Great race! 😊 👍
Nice my hometown!
Perez's seat just opened up!
No wonder Yuki won against The champion defender
the trophy is taller than yuki
Max, u do not always have to win. Fun is more important
Yuki is sending it hard 😂
You heard it here first, folks. Put Max Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda in the same machine and miraculous things might happen.
Yuki just unlocked a new hobby
That looks like fun.
Funny how these things sound better than the modern f1 car
I'm surprisingly interested in the answer to a question I've never pondered.
Everyone else: smiling and having fun  Max: -_-
3:20 ok Yuki chillax :D
2:49 Have you fallen in? :D
Mud Bogging is next
this is why i watch youtube
角田くんの豪快なウィリーに惚れた😍
Max looks like a super focused dad thats go-karting his children
Next up should be monster jam
Yuki RB seat nexht year?
And for the first time Yuki is the champion of the world!
Max - Such an easy guy to hate
the trophy is almost bigger than Yuki :D
Muita grana, muita grana kkkkk
I think the brits call that a damp track!   Yuki beat max in the wet!  Crazy!
Yuki va por el lugar de MAx en RB :v jajajaj amo a estos muchachos.
Let's go little tiger!
Are these the new Formula 1 cars for the Spa Francorchamps this year ? 🤣 Red Bull gives you victories ❤️
Yuki deserves a seat in redbull f1 team now...he has defeated a world champion....
You know it's gonna be good if starts with Florida Man.
Yuki was born to be a Swamp Buggy racer, he was having the time of his life
I love how red bull exposes their drives to the culture and way of life of the city or country they are racing in.
何これ最高！ヾ(@^▽^@)ノ
Max how could you lose to a kid 😂
Yuki 2022 WDC Confirmed😅
Finally Yuki managed to beat max in some race😂😂
They nearly porpoise as much as the F1 cars.
This is how Bobby boshuea made it to the burben bowl
Max vs Yuki should be at least 3 laps
Love me some Yuki & Max, love these videos. Stoked for the GP.
Can you give me an opportunity to jump into one of those? This looked epic!
yuki is crazy ahahahahaha
Florida a place to live life full of madness
Yuki got to feel porpoising
Those are some fast tractors.....haha
I would like to see Tony Stewart put them in some sprint cars on a dirt track
My boy Yuki 😂
Bulls in swamp just amazing rides
Verstappen passing and flooding the dude in turn 1 is the most Max thing ever.
Yuki might be smol but he is one CRAZYYYY dude
max: I don't know what it can do really  (bit goes for it) Yuki: scared by every joke or comment max makes
FIRST
F1-  new extreme series, where drivers have to first complete wild races before they start on track, points are same for on track. Sponsored by redbull. And Netflix will have to make a new segment for this part - dare to drive. Jokes aside, props to redbull for these fun activities in between races. Shows another side of the drivers and their other activities as well.
We can see the difference between american drivers vs euro/ asian drivers..americans are good in straights just like drag racing..on the other hand euro asian are good in corners
Some last words from yuki would have been great
Yuki beat max. Im calling that an achievement unlocked 👍
Isn't IT nice to do a Champions Chip. Maybe Like Rock?
Yuki looked like he wanted to go another round
Crazy cool
Max's face completely changed when he got in the car he was fully locked in
AlphaTauri gives you wings
Yuki wdc confirmed
this explain how Yuki can ride those wet grasses in imola as if it is dry tarmac.
I like how max tells random facts about the car and yuki is just like „really?“
Max: Make Franz proud Yuki!  Yuki: *Sends it*
Only in America. Only in Florida.
King Yuki!!!
I'm a RB F1 fan first because the Red Bull brand sponsors the craziest sports. Also doesn't hurt they have a potential once in a generation driver, but boy did Yuki smoke him in a swamp buggy!
角田がレッドブルの企画に参加してるのが、嬉しい。
F1 is going for american audience, since nascar is borig.
Max can if the Race Director let’s him
The Trophy is nearly as big as yuki
Never knew I needed a Zion - Yuki crossover
Yuki Toretto 😭
Most goated f1 team 🔥 🐐
SPA 2021 😎
big up redbull nice of you to give your athletes some good memories
yuki's trophy is almost his size😂
03:30 don't let it happen on Sunday guys
I used to go all the time to the swamp buggy races when I lived in Naples. They are a blast!
As an American, I’ve never seen anything more Florida than this and demand a full GP ASAP!
🤔
Yuki in 2023 Red Bull seat confirmed
Yuki experiencing purpousing even in water 👀👀
They should do swamp buggy qualifying. Max doesn't have the best reaction times...Yuki dominated here.
These things looks cool
Y'all are fun! Welcome to Florida!
Yuki had some porposing in the first run)
I was waiting for the crocodiles to have a bite
Can't believe they actually let their drivers do this before a race weekend.
Highest paid vs lowest paid
good luck to both teams for this sunday, go nail the race guys
Yuki was wild at that start LOL
never seen something like that thats so so cool
We needed this for the Spa last year
2:23 Max recreating Brazil 2016
Biggest loss in Max's career, he will never recover from this.
Yuki replacing Verstappen in the Red Bull after the Miami GP confirmed.
The trophy for this race is 10x better than the trophy for the actual f1 race.
El campeón del mundo ni se limita en una competencia amistosa ☠️
Those buggies are faster than the 2022 aston martin's. lol
900馬力のマシンを沼でぶっ飛ばすのクレイジーすぎるだろｗ 超たのしそう
Max was just calm AF.

Something tells me Yuki will do great in Rallying or Dakar, he definitely has control technique
Good on ya Red Bull, showing time and time again how to be fast and have fun!
that trophy was taller than yuki lol
This is why redbull is not only one of my favorite f1 teams, but one of my favorite companies of all time.
Sometimes the Americans do something good, this is one of those times.
max took it bad at the end 🤣🤣🤣, come on Yuki, be cool!
こういうレース車両で沼地レースやっているのが羨ましい 角田　速えぇぇぇぇ！！！
The trophy is taller than Yuki 💀
2:24 Max just being max on the closest you can get to a divebomb in a swamp buggy :p
A typical Dutch guy when he sees that: just laugh a bit and watch  An American guy when he sees that: Screaming and jumping around...
Actually max don't want to be wet during last race
Max: *Cool calm and controlled launch, inside line through T1 and calmly take the win*  Yuki: *W H E E L I E  T I M E*
Yuki!!!!
0:56  Yuki reevaluating his decision to participate.
Max definitely won at avoiding getting wet 😎​
Now that's proper porpoising!
Redbull marketing always delivers.
Yuki really became one of my favorite f1 drivers. I hope he will continue to grow like he is still doing. And manage to become world champignon one day.
yuki ate max alive
What y’all know bout florida man

This is what they should bring to spa this year
Wow this is the first time I've heard about swamp buggy racing. Kinda wanna try it out
Haha Max making jokes about lifting off  .. Yuki like .. "really ?? "  .. Max ..  "nah"  ... and then it really happens to Yuki 🤣
Max loses Red Bull seat to Yuki
Yuki is coming for that second seat at Red Bull. You heard it here first!!! 😎
That's one way to get them used to porpoising.
Red Bull's brought some new regulation upgrade packages to Miami huh... Too bad the Marina water be fake tho 🤪
3:24 mercedes and ferrari in the straights be like:
Whenever max is racing he face becomes 😐😐😐😐😐😐
Yuki and his weight advantage lol
What is it with Max and water lol. The boy goes and finds grip wherever there's water ;D
Yuki, if you ever leave F1 you know where to race next. HAHAHAHAHA
Yuki made swamp buggies porpoise.
Yuki's got so much rear end  - Max probably
The trophy is nearly as tall as yuki. 😂🥹
Yuki finally find something that; reach his arms :)

3:20 POV: You’re in a Mercedes
that looked so sick would be the best to drive one of those things

I need to get my highspeed drone out for one of these. I bet I could keep up with even the F1 cars with my fixed wing. Would be awesome footage.
Max was right about yuki getting air haha 🤣. The little Japanese was fast as though
max is always good in wet
New take on F1
Yuki got some serious porpoising in the first heat!
Yuki is just too good, he really be completing side quests at this point xD

Petition To Get Max, Checo, Pierre and Yuki to do a race across a country
Max didnt even got wet at all like a real pro ❤️🧡
Yuki like riding a "Red Bull". give him more powerfull  car, let see what he got 😂
Max, Yuki is faster than you..
I’d rather watch a series of these than Drive to Survive or even the actual F1 races to be honest.
Yuki is way too light 😆
The red bull breaking down after winning is the most realistic thing I have seen so far lol
I’m really curious where this venue is. Looks so fun!
Max wearing his eternity shirt as usual
Nice yuki👍🏻😂
This proves that Red Bull is not just a drinks company. 😁
Press conference to annunce Max to Alpha Tauri and Yuki to Red bull when?
1:27 I guess Mercedes makes motor bikes now  ahem  f u n n y
That Red Bull Buggy looked really slow.
Is it only me who wants to see this on the snow?
Look at all that porposing. (Someone had to say it lol)
Now waiting for a f1 car to do some siiick drifts.
1) should do the full lap 2) why was there no mention of the "sippy hole"  3) needed play-by-play from either the Diamond P Sports guys or a crew from TNN (or were they the same crew?) 4) Can this replace FP1 on all F1 race weekends? (needless to say that was the best promo event in a long time)
Its a tradition for red bull to have some cool show every weekend oh we love it
Man that is insane, what a blast! All KUDOS to REDBULL for letting their champ have a crack, mental
Yuki in Gangsta paradise. 😂
Uncle Max giving Yuki the moral boost he deserves to perform again this weekend
The course is a bit damp.
moonshine vs great whiskey 😂😂😂😂
i really appreciate how red bull makes these events with their athletes, it shows that they want to go above and beyond for our entertainment. GOOD JOB!
Yuki got wings!!!!! He almost lifted off!!
