Humanity will prevail
Spider reminds me of Tarzan
Yeah these videos just tells me RDA are a bunch of idiots who are too lazy to do their job properly.
0:26 Odinsleep!
I was so disappointed, this movie ran like it was written by a 5 year old 😢. Avatar 1 is a masterpiece by comparison, with real characters. This made me want to go back to the first film 😢😢😢 fond memories.
LOVED this!  Well done!
Common sense is very real with yall
0:23  i love how you still animated ronal doing the cpr thingy😭
Payakan going in with the gun killed (CetOps) hard. And Qaritch getting whaled. Should've let Neytiri threatening Spider out of the movie too. With Tonowari
... or clone the humans.
Thanks 😂😂😂. So cool.
I mean yeah, but they needed a way to somehow shape avatar 3 💔 also there's a bunch of more movies on the run
I mean, Natetri  does have a point and she is literally the one that convinces the village to take them in because of what Jake did in the first movie so it stinks to her that they have a home now and they don’t have to go find another place, even though Jake brought them to that location
The baby war cry
Okay, but you could save Neteyam from death
😂Swim under the fire movie
It should have ended when the Space faring Species just landed on top of the Navi Homevillage, and glassed the Ocean.
I would’ve used a lot of area spread weapons on the Navi or gas
idk the way neytiri yelled “my jake” has my side hurting
To be honest, the sea tribe suddenly missing from the final fights was indeed odd, when I watched the movie. I'm waiting for the director's cut.  Cameron denied it will happen, but never say never.
Mankind should have still won.
Wait if we didn’t have our villain in the movie then we won’t have a third movie
1:23 water chief GO!👁️👄👁️👍
Avatar: Fire & Ash Coming on December 2025.
bro the socks got me too hard
1:20 That's too good lol
was that rose and jack that was a nice touch
Why the humans need the space-whale-brain-juice if they have digital mind transfering and cloning? They did if with quaritch mind and the avatar body, should be even easier with pure humans
If Payakan pulled out a glock and started shooting at the boats, that still wouldve been AMAZING
take a shot everytime lo'ak says bro or cuz
I see why you don’t make a HISHE of Atla, because it’s already perfect☺
The only good part of the movie was that it looked beautiful to watch.
Not to mention that Spider basically betrayed his friends at the end of the movie by saving Quaritch and putting them in danger again 🤨 He deserves his own seat in The Villan Pub
Ok so I'm not 100% sure on this, but I think the art used for the Poop Deck of the Titanic in the background there might be the same as the art used in the Titanic HISHE a decade before this one
It should have ended with bolter, chainsaw and cleansing fire For the Emperor
All I remember about this movie was falling asleep multiple times in the theater
this guys has brain
The correct ending would be the destruction of all xenos. For the Imperium of Man!
It should have ended with people mercing the smurfs with drones
nope if quaritch dying, then it ain’t ending like that 😡
kinda offended on spiders behalf for his chosen voice actor here lmaoo
1:02 😂
They only destroyed a fishing boat, not even built for war
Tulkun with a gun 😂😂😂
"BRO! I mean DaD"😂😂😂
Why didn’t they just land the giant ships that annihilate everything under them over the mountains where they knew Jake was
How it ACTUALLY sshould have ended: They bombard the place from orbit turning it into a giant parking lot, then take the resources they need. How I would like it to end: The warhammer40k marines come and claim this world in 30 seconds.
It's only after seeing Brenden Fraser that I get that reference.
They can also transfer the conscious mind in the clones. They could clone a new human and transfer their consciousness into them without any anti Aging cure bs…
It should not have even started in a first place
Nah, Rod from God all the way
all assuming the navi aren't just nuked from orbit
Bro, i mean dad
I just realised how short avatar 2 would´ve been if they didnt actually called the humans for help xD
It makes no sense how jake called in his friends! Like it is an 8 hour flight, took Ronal 10 minute2 to cure Kiri.
This ain’t Way of water, this Water of way💀💀
Lol
I watched this m9vie today and I am still shocked by how gorgeous and legendary it was
0:51 “my baby is strong” definitely looks like it😂😂😂😂
The whale like gish are called tulkun
Ronal’s baby and the whale dude with a gun: 😂 😆
I just love this guy
0:49 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is not how it should end
Tonowari and Ronal leaving Tsireya behind was def something i did not understand
1:01 , 1:48 ^ Bro what…🤣
😂 They Can Travel Insteller Space & Have Morden Guns, Helicopters, Technology But They Still Can't Defect the Guys Who Fight With Them With a Spare  😂😂😂😂 , 😂😂😂 Seriously 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro I mean dad LMAO that's a good one
It would be a smart way to clone whales and bread them for their brains because they saw what those wild whales did right
Kiri Like: ODENSLEEP Ronal: I haVe DoNe iT
1:01 😂😂😂
The baby screaming from the womb was one of the funniest gags HISHE has done recently. Caught me completely off guard and had me absolutely dying hahaha
I hope humanity 😈😈😈😈 wins in the third part , it ain't a warcrime if it ain't humans
That’s what I wanted. Quaritch not surviving and not it ending in a continuing way
For a military operation they really have some blowy up vehicles
Why does the whale-catfish thing look like an Apostle from Berserk?
That actually makes so much sense: just clone a whale multiple times.
The baby in the womb should have just been scrambled eggs 🤣
Im strangly a really big fan of the ending song. I like it when hishe sings.
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣nager sous le feu ca m'a tué
Let’s be honest. Whale brain goop isn’t stoping anyone’s age. I dont care what alien you get the miracle cure from. Same with your obtainable “unobtainium” it’s just a rock
Man I JUST watched this, and the part that infuriated me the most was when Spider saved Quaritch. Like.... why? It made no sense. I'm surprised HISHE didn't bring up that really weird part of the film.
I can’t wait for avatar 3 and 4 teasers
avavtar should off ended like that
0:23 bro 🤣🤣🤣
Fanmade not good enough nobodys fanmade is good enough to be real ending
Copyright
this movie is so bad
This channel is a "Sins cinema" with animation
What they REALLY should have done is keep the Papyrus logo
Txantsan nìtxan nang, oe peng ! ^^
theres a flaw with cloning whale brains, firstly, supplying the immediate needs for whale brains, secondly the cost of cloning would likely be more than the cost of hunting, its just economics
If we just made everything in a lab the economy would crumble 😞😭
If they wanted to stop ages, they could just clone themselves and transfer memories...
Avatar, The Way of Water: 192 minutes.  Avatar, The Way of Water if Payakan had a gun : 32 minutes
Omg the whale refrence 😢😂😂
"This whole movie could have ended way differently. Do you know about the automatic GL? Yeah, just pop a few of them near them, and the shockwave will be enough to cause mass internal bleeding, especially in the water.
yeah, the water chief did just dissapear mid-battle
The movie is 1 year old!  Omg Brendan Fraser as a literal whale 😂😂😂 Genius
Also love how at the start of the movie their landing gear just nukes the whole area.  The can literally just landing-genocide anyone they want...
these are soooo funny
Odensleep! 😄
9 months ago 😢
As of 5 February 2023, Avatar w is the third highest grossing film of all time 😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊
The baby war screaming inside of the belly 🤣🤣🤣
It's weird that lo,ak always said bro in the movie
This made a 100x more sense than the actual movie.
Here is a fun fact. The trip to the closer planet that can harbour life would last 13 million years with a ship travelling 100 000 km per hour
“My jake!” 😂😂😂😂😂
Don't know if it was covered in the video or not but was watching Cinemasins and they bring up a couple good points  That whale fluid is said to stop aging but it's only been 13 years so how can they know it works or how effective it is? Or did they just make it and they're selling snake oil?  Also considering they're able to create clones of *alien* beings and transfer their consciousness into them... couldn't that same technology allow one to become functionally immortal by simply passing themselves on into a new body when their current one is on its deathbed?
I was in the movie for the humans
Man, the visuals and CGI are just unmatched, but it does seem like it comes at the cost of brain-power on the other aspects of story-telling.
What?? I was certain they were going to point out the scene where Jake was choking out Quaritch UNDER THE WATER, where he was already not breathing. Isn't that like trying to choke a robot? 😂😂
2:43 jake and rose in the back😂
I was so mad when Jake called Norm without thinking. They got found IMMEDIATELY, and it could expose High Camp too!
oh my this movie was so bad lol
WHAT ABOUT NETEYAM!?
Make us realize lots of stuffs
jack and rose in the background got me T_T T_T
NB PEEP ROSE AND JACK ON THE SHIP!!!
“This current method relies on them reproducing faster than we can hunt them”  Add to that you’re specifically targeting mothers with calfs, literally killing two birds with one stone in the process, which limits their potential to repopulate
13 years and they produced such a sh1t movie
it should have ended with rda completely wiping out the na vi
1:23 not payakan holding an gun😂
1:11 pregnant women
Lo’ak says bro like half the actual movie. Really insane!
I was hoping for the general just saying she won't send out the colonel anymore since the attacks on the supply trains have suddenly stopped.
Yeah it just felt so strange water nation just left...
I personally adore the little change in animation when Tonowari is swimming, compared to the others. Such a fun detail!
When the guy got killed I said well. That settles it
I am so annoyed they killed off Neteyam, like seriously you introduce him and a love interest for him in the future and then just forget that and were like ohh well he dead now. 😢😢
THAT would have saved a LOT of time - would have been extremely beneficial
Avatar 2: The Way of the North Atlantic in 1912, er, I mean, the Way of Water.
I was so confused when the clan left the family alone 😂
odin sleep.
Bro did anyone see the titanic ester egg
Bro someone help us bro =))
DId Neteyam end up living or not????
I was hoping for "I think we should orbital strike for safety at the end."
I want Neteyam to survive! PLEASE!!!!!!
This movie gave me the shits 95% of the time I was watching it . . .
So Neteyam is alive?😆
Dude, the end of that movie is 4 back-to-back action scenes ALL IN THE SAME DANG LOCATION!
There were so many flaws in the movie, but HISHE did us all justice
I loved part one but hate part 2 whats wrong with me?
Neteyam has to live at the end!!😢😢
or use a dron to kill all vilige
2:40 Look who's on top of the ship lol X3
I think all the water people died. If you pay attention you can see them all get shot. I don’t know, the movie was still absolutely dogsh*t.
Tbh this movie was good
This would have been better as the actual ending than what we got lol XD
It’s “ma jake” not “my Jake” 😅
Jack and Rose on the ship! 😂 Also yeah the fire! Just swim under it! I’m like, “James, your Titanic is showing.”
The one thing that did actually bug me ALOT at the end of the movie. The entire ending of the fight section hinges on most of them drowning in the boat as it floods. Yet earlier in the movie AND IN THE DAMN SCENE they already fixed this issue with the jellyfish creatures that literally allow you to breath under water. Couldn’t they just, I don’t know always keep one nearby like how spider always keeps his oxygen mask on. Could have saved that entire ending there and then. Could have even increased the fighting underwater if both of them had one of them mfs strapped to their backs.
Jack and Rose on top of the sinking ship 🤣🤣🤣
who else also spotted jack and rose on that ship?
Honestly where did the water people go lol
DID NO ONE SEE THE TITANIC CHARACTERS ON THE SHIP?
I said to my wife while watching this “just swim under the fire?”
I love your villain pub socks song! Please more of it! ❤
Like how they also referenced James Cameron’s Titanic as well. I want to see Avatar 3 HISHE reference Terminator now lol
PAYAKAN HAVING A GUN IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seriously Silly mistakes in writing
Hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂
What about the fact that now the kid has a tracking device in his mask as was told when they first left him free from interrogation
Hahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍
Can we have villain pub mugs?
Neytiri: Why do they keep coming after us? What started this war?  Jake: Pandora is filled with unobtanium rocks that we needed for energy!  Neytiri: Rocks? All you wanted was fuken rocks?
Right off the bat  “BRO, I MEAN DAD!” Had me dying 😂
The beginning 😂😂😂
They had to save something for Avatar 3: Swimming Under Fire
Where is neteyam te Sully
"I dont wear socks" " YOU DO NOW"
After the real ending the clone of Quaritch must say: I love the smell of napalm in the morning!
How it should have ended? An hour earlier.
I like how Neytiri accepted Jake, fell in love with him, saved him from drowning in Pandora's atmosphere.... and then Spider? "He belongs with his kind", when the kid is even more Na'vi than Jake himself. Or is it because he doesn't have an Avatar??
Avatar 2 should’ve ended 1 second after it started
i'm 90% sure that James cameron forgot what happend in the first movie
The whale allegory was priceless
Her in the back saving KIRI 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
I keep asking when these guys will make the perfect movie......
I didn't understand why humans would try to colonize a planet they can't naturally breath on.   Who discovered the brain goo was giving people immortality in the first place?   Why not gather all the Navi around the world again to take out the humans again?   Why was Jake such an Ahole to his son?    Why would Spider want to go back to the family that the mom was willing to kill him?
Here to tick boxes of stuff that bothered me in the heat of the moment. Seriously, when they had montages or learning to hold their breath underwater for ridiculously long times only to then get forced to dry land by a thin band of fire on the water. I was livid :D
That Oscar Winning Brendan Fraser cameo was totally UNEXPECTED and AWESOME! - Lmao!!!😂🤣💗
whale for the win.
that chaos at the beggining was epic lmao
“I HAVE DOOONE  ITTT”
Stop being ruthless. Ah…  you’re hitting a lot of the things I was thinking about.
What happened to Lo’ak 😨
Thank you for making this so I can not waste 3 hours of my life.
I did wonder where the sea people went
1:02 HOLY SHT PAYAKANS GOT A GUN
I love this! :D
That “The Whale” reference, man.
IT WAS FUNNY
The talking have gun
Neytiri “ma Jake I am leaving your for another sky person” Jake “Why, what can I do to make it up to you?” Scientist boyfriend “Here’s a bright idea….”
Should’ve faded out with the sock song. Gets extra obnoxious at the end and then infinitely more so having to hear it more than once now. So now it’s a race to close out ur videos before it starts.
Hah!
Payakan with a glock will live in my head rent free
2:41 The two people lmaooo
Will we have to wait another 10 years for a sequel 😦
So much of this movie could only be explained by "so the movie could happen".
Facts lol
The whale reference is omg
Payakan shooting guns is top tier humor right there🤣
i swear the avatars had plot armor.
Its even dumber than that. The ability to clone AND the ability to put people in stasis neccesitates pretty much everything you need to be effectively ageless and immortal. You don't need the whales at all.
How Avatar 2 Should Have Ended: about 80 minutes earlier
So many plot holes in this movie, just crazy. Was like watching a 3hr screen saver. Pretty to look at but no substance.
Lmfao when the fkn whale was shooting the gun 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:11 I hope they do this joke in Across the Spider-verse Hishe
I don’t think I’ve ever heard “bro” used so much in a film let alone one like this lmao 😂
1:49 yeah that my question  suddently all of the reef tribe vanish. i mean, they not even abort the main ship after the fight to finish the job  they just vanish 🤷🏻‍♂️
PPAAAAPPPYYYYYRRRRUUUUSSSSS!!!
Bring on the exterminatus...
At the opening credits!? 20 years proved to much, an expectations were to high. It was missing something. The movie isnt aweful, just not the most interesting story maybe. Not excited about the future installs. The magic is gone
❤
❤
❤
Lmao if Humans Wanted They could have simply Engineered a Virus that could have killed all Navi om pandora
The on that actually gets me is humanity going to move to a planet which has poisonous air, but hey bringing O2 mask from other solar sistems must be cheap... right?
How about we don’t call your Sky People friends? and why would we all just leave were the best parts! Hahaha!
the ending song was too good to ignore
😂😂😂
Or they could have just cloned every human on earth as Navi and had their own village
And the dude at the end was right just clone the brains and make your money
That’s so true if they had just asked the chiefs wife instead of calling the his friends to help with his daughter
y’all so funny i love this channel already
I hAvE dOnE iTtTtTt
The Whale reference was crazy😂
And the bullets ! Bullets dissapeir when they touch water xD
Avatar 2’s plot is just like Avatar 1
So they can clone the na'vi and imprint new memories into them why not clone humans and make copies of everyone as backups to keep going not to mentioned you can keep living in a younger version of you.
3:25 Villain Pub Socks😇
Hilarious
Odin sleep is back!
Why did unobtanium become worthless?
That ending song was everything 😂
1:43 WATTA CHEEF GOO!
You should do Bollywood movies. That will be insane
GHAUHAUHAUAHUAHAUHAUAHUA
The tarzan kid is on the wrong movie...
I lost it at the baby in her belly😂
Finally watched the movie I'm surprised how bad it is🙄.  Started so illogical  with surprise children coming into existence, to horrible parenting and Ended up looking like I was watching some Terminator movie.  There's so many errors with this movie
Nice Whale reference!
Yeah in my opinion, it would had just made more sense for them to just stay where they were originally! Ya know in the jungle where the animals killed ALL intruders on sight. That would had just left the cloned soldiers to deal with. And with a whole tribe at your command, ya know the tribe who had REAL EXPERIENCE with these enemies...that would had made them a minimal threat at best.
I always thought, throughout the whole movie, Lo'ak's head looked like an upside down pear
freaking Payakan with a Gun xD im dead
"Odin sleep" lol 😂
this film was completely unecessary and once again just another attempt at flexing their "visual" design
In the beginning of Avatar2, they set half the forest on fire just to land troops. I was waiting for Mr. Bright-Idea to show up and say, “Why do we have to go in, when we can just keep burning up the forest??” End movie.
Ha! You had the Titanic sinking in the background there!
I always loved the idea of a spacefaring superpower that could annihilate 300 squate Kilometers with Orbital Warships (its not hard for Them there was a actuall space battleship planed irl) with nuclear weapons on board. I mean they are here for resources just annihilate the Blue monkeys Form space and Take all the resources.
Guys What’s That On The Ship
Unpopular opinion I think spider and grace are real brother sister maybe the cornel and the scientist were a thing because spider and grace share natural sibling love
I just watched it yesterday and this is all the questions I had on the movie. Only other 2 things are, the humans that escaped the ship, did they actually escape? Also, nothing more about the human city and next plan of attack?
That was weird I never thought about that
Oordin sleep 😂😂😂
1:44  hahaha, ya i was wondering where they were from the rest of the fight, like he just vanished
i almost crye in the intro, love the thic 44 hat <3, fly high recon
"Have you tried dynamite fishing?" Asked Harry Maybourne. "What the?!" Quaritch said. "Who are you?" "Oh I'm from another franchise where we also fight aliens with relatively primitive weapons. Except we don't lose nearly as much as you do. So have you tried dynamite fishing?" "Hmm. Well we do have plenty of explosives. And this body of mine does have a pretty good arm... It's worth a shot." <later> "Well what do you know, it is super effective at killing anything underwater." "Told ya."
The titanic reference
00:48 Odin Sleep!!!🤣🤣🤣
I laughed so hard I cryed
Indeed
Dude idk why but I’m so annoyed over Neteyams death cause it just seemed so unnecessary yet at the same time so obvious. I liked Nehtiri’s “development” following the death of her son but like she could’ve had that same development if quarditch held Tuk in hostage instead of Kiri. Also Neteyam’s character had so much potential but it was clear from the beginning that he was never supposed to be part of the main story he was more of a supporting role that had no development himself which is such a waste bro I loved Neteyam.
About the Last Part. The Navi DNA and Humans were compatible enough to do the Cloning/Avatar process.   The Whales are literally built different and are probably way smarter than us too. Their Brains were said to be far more complex so Cloning that might have complications
Jack and rose in the background at 2:41 had me 🤣🤣🤣
I thought it was funny that it seemed like it took days for the Sully's to arrive at Tonowari's village, but it took probably less than a day for Norm and Max to arrive. Talk about good timing.
It’s funny because it’s true 😭 this movie was a mess but I’m still interested in it’s lore and world building
WATER CHEIF GOOOOO
Not Jack and rose just sinking in the background...
2 words Lockheed Martin
Will there be Imperium of Man reference?
3:20 it's more economic
Payakan 🤣😆😂
All I’m gonna say about the first part is he was scared for his kids lol
That, was, AMAZING. THE ANIMATION WAS SO GOOFY AND FUNNY. I LOVE IT <3
The Tulkun coming out of the water with a revolver literally had me and my roommate in stitches lol
how avatar 2 should've ended: "general they're hiding in the floating rocks" "great, just nuke them from orbit" movie ends
Was waiting the whole movie to see the big orange bird Leonotryx thing to come out of nowhere
I think the oldest brother shouldn’t have died, he should’ve been disabled or something, it would’ve been interesting to see in the next movie how him and his family would deal with him being paralyzed or immobile.
See, this is what Avatar haters don't realize. You can point out and make fun of a movies flaws and still enjoy it.
I came here because I saw Payakan with a gun, but what I got was even better. Jack and Rose slowly sinking in the background when Tonowari mentions Titanic flipping killed me.
That song about socks was a banger, I want it on spotify!!
the cameo from Brendan Fraser was nice.
Kinda hoping that spider got some Na'vi poos
We're agree
I love how in the thumbnail jake looks serious and Kiri is just kiri and lo'ak looks like a chad and spider looks scared and neytiri is :/
Forword this to show it to the cast
Jake moved a war and wasted one son life to figure out what he did last time.
Enjoying the end track 👌😍
This is how it should have ended you're right 👍
90.9% of the comments here be like: he never fails to make me laugh, his content never disappoint us
Lmaooo Payakan with the gun is sending me 😂😂😂
Way it return
I HUV DUNE UTTTT
2:10 ^ Love this🤣👏🏼
silly how it should have ended like always.
Also, how have they still not made the vehicles arrow-proof, you would think they would learn. And also, why have humans still not switched to remote drone to reduce casualties. And lastly, the humans never actually fired any shotd
With the planet's atmosphere burning as the Xenocide of the Na'vi is finally completed.
1:43 it would be funny when they should put them in the movie
Wtf
I really don’t remember seeing this movie (but I know I saw it).
Am feeling luck
0:46 😂😂😂😂😂 god this has me dying😂😂😂😂
It should’ve never began. 🤌🏾
Did they just delete Lo’ak and only put him in ONE scene💀
Neteyam still being dead in both the movie and the how it should have ended .
Why isn't Neteyam alive?
"is it true that whales can have guns for battle?" me: *yes*
2:35 titanic reference in the background xd
1:22 killed me
PAPYRUSSSSS
Зачем их так уродовать?
Should have ended the first time they had Sully in their gun sights and were like "oh no we cant just kill him now..."
I saw Jack and Rose on the ship
Can we all agree that the movie avatar  everything could’ve been solve if they just made natiri go on her rampages. The movie would’ve been finished but they keep holding her back
2:11 I just love the reference of the movie "the whale"  Also, you were so on point! The movie had amazing visuals but the story was meh. A 3 hour movie after 13 years... I just don't know what they will do for avatar 3,4,5
Loak in the thumbnail : 😏
2:14 .....
2:24. The Pandora Titanic, when will they learn to stop calling things the Titanic.
All this insane technology and yet they don't seem to have invented bullet proof glass. Could really save a few chopper pilots if they didn't get sniped by weapons that were invented many thousands of years ago.
Wow just wow
You also could have done the Sully’s giving aid to Spider while running from Quaritch’s squad in the forest or Neteyam and Lo’ak deciding to wait to rescue Spider along with Kiri and Tuk to help avoid Neteyam’s death
I don't forgive you for 1:22 😂
RONAL IN THE BACK IM CRYINGGGG
The cool factor of these movies is off the chart. It's got heart, it's jam packed with rich detail, phenomenal action, good heart and Cameron tech galore.
This video is way, way better than the actual movie. You summed up the important parts, and I didn't have to watch a 2 hour screen saver.
I love the music at the end, is there an extended version of it somewhere? =)
Tonowari saved this movie ending
Odinsleep😂😂😂😂
Yea very true the fire water prob on the 3rd
2:42 look at Rose and Jack, LMAO.
Don't even know how it actually ended so this is the official ending of avatar 2 for me.
i am still sad neteyam died
their is somthing with the solar eclips, thats the reason they dessappered
Bro .. I mean dad
This is really surprising that this one didn’t find as many mistakes as the first avatar other than just a couple of things
Agreed. Another ending could be: If the sniper shot Sully, while he approached the ship,  then shot the two daughters that were handcuffed. End of story.
When the fire on the water scene I thought exactly the same lol
That doctor whale hunter guy is def gonna start playing for the other team in the next Avatar
Oodin sleep!
😅😂🤣🤣😂😅
LMFAOOO
Watching your videos is like a dejavu to me, just more fun and animated. I literally tell myself while watching this movies the same things that make no or little sense. You guys are doing a great job.
spider was miscast in the movie his performance was so bad
Odinsleep was what really got me 😂
Dude… whales are dead now…
Another movie I'm glad I skipped   You guys rock
Unpopular opinion: Miles Quaritch should be part of villains' pub.
titanic cameo wohoooo
HEY! I like the font!!
So no one is gonna mention neytiri randomnly yelling “Ma Jake!” When she shot the arrow 💀💀💀💀💀
Are we dead inside? My SO and I made it 2hrs in, got bored, and turned it off. I couldn't connect with the characters or plot. It was pretty, but that's about it. I'm not sure why this was so popular. Am I missing something?
I don't know how we the humans lost, we have advanced technology we have assault rifles machine guns heavy weapons attack helicopters we even replicated the navi and we still lost, how?
What's jack and rose doing over there?😂
"bro, i mean dad" lmao
Yeah the movie was a beautiful spectacle, S-tier visual, the water effects were VFX achievements... but *IN THE NAME OF EVERYTHING THAT IS HOLY,* the movie was full of plot-holes as far as the eye can see, and it was as un-original as it comes.
This video makes only good points except the first thing. It was totally in-character for Jake to call in his Skypeople friends even though they were pretty useless and it was a bad decision afterwards. However, it was his first time ever seeing Na'vi not only having a seizure butit was his adoptive daughter too AND he trusts his friends. so yeah. + without that decision Quaritch wouldn't have found them, therefore no further plot. It was a good checkpoint for the plot. But yeah again, pretty much agreed with the rest - espcially with the Metkayina just being gone not making sense.
Could you do the Little Mermaid (how it should have ended) sometime?
The reference to The Whale lol
Who else saw Jack and rose on the boat when it sinking
People throwing spears or shooting arrows: 100% hit rate ... they never missed, ever People shooting guns: 0.001% hit rate ... I think only the older brother got shot, somehow, off screen
They had WAY too many characters to the point where they were all useless.
Papyrus 😂
No one seems to mention this, but spider was USELESS
“We’ve already seen the sinking ship movie , this is the swim under the fire movie .” Got me dying 💀🤣
Did she just say Odin Sleep😂?...
payakan😭😭😭😭
Where's some more villain pub anyway
People I have a great idea! Orbital bombardment
Who saw the Jack and rose above the ship when it was sinking. 🤣🤣
I enjoyed the original Avatar: Ferngully
The way ronal was helping kiri in the background💀😂
You forgot the part where Neytiri was about to kill Spider even though he was her "stepson" to get back at Mile.  Miles doesn't even care about Spider.
Bro i mean dad lmao 😅😻😊
What's up with the Anakin Skywalker girl? I mean who's her father? And why does she have those superpowers? 🤔🤔🤔
Why did the Spiderman save the main bad guy at the end? That part made no sense other than plot armor for next sequel 🤔🤔🤔
2:34 is truly on point
Yeah that part with fire was weird. Pretty much in every movie they swim under it 🤔🤔🤔
I absolutely adore the first film but I think James Cameron just forgot that STORY is just as important as visuals. The way of water is an extremely beautiful film but the story.....he just forgot that Jake was human once upon a time. He should've EXPECTED the retaliation from the humans and used those 18-20 years teaching the navi how to better protect themselves. And also... Why was Jake's journey on critical difficulty while Papa dragons journey was on super easy mode? I'm surprised papa dragon wasn't flying on toruk while holding a thanator under his arm. EDIT: WHERE WAS THE THANATORS? I'm guessing James didn't use THANATORS in the second film because papa dragons super easy afk quest would've been 5 minutes long
I havent watched this channel in so long omg
Good Video!!! Sock Fetish Boy!!!
I totally forgot about the water navi hahaha
Exactly like they just left and did'nt even took their daughter with them
i need alive Neteyam 🥲
My God, I just realized you put the titanic behind them.
Odiiin's sleep got me 🤣
The song at the end is fire.
Weird situation. First 10 min of movie  sky people just burn the Navi's home. Why they didn't do the same with Jake's Stronghold ? xD Movie should finished in first 10 minutes
I haven't been laughing to HISHEs for years, but the Brendan Fraser part got me.
0:27 Peak animation!
The chief and his fleet were too busy hunting down the last survivors of the whaling crew in revenge of their murdered spirit siblings! That’s why they didn’t appear later near the ending of the movie!  Also, even if you did manage to copy every neuron pathway in the tukuln brain, its processing power required to generate the cerebral fluid to its anti-aging composition would be highly difficult to replicate, because it is a result of thousands of years of environmental, social and emotional interactions and life-time experiences!
Did anyone else notice the titanic in this
near the end i was like : where are these water clan?!! didnt they suppose to fight? and they just disappear when eclipse? like, how?
Uh..question. Where did that rescue helicopter come from??
2:15 The Whale reference lol 😂
2:40 i was thinking the same
It should've ended with the Humans winning and the xenos getting their asses kicked
Omg this is soooo true hahhahaha 😂
I wish the Metkayina had a good excuse to leave the fight instead of just ghosting
1:14 MY JAKE!!! 🤣
Brendan Fraser as The Whale suddenly appearing is the icing on the cake 😭😆
1:22 lmao, damn gg payakan😂
Not The Whale reference plus JACK AND ROSE sinking in the background 😭😭😭🤣
the simple solution with the whole whale thing is just cloning humans. I mean they have the tech to literally make that show altered carbon and find another planet to invade. on top of that why invade a planet that you can't even breath their oxygen if earth is dying? I'm sorry but the plot of both movies is hollow and just an excuse for James to use a bunch of VFX.
i hated that they killed off nateyam it was so unnecessary idk but i feel like they shouldn’t have killed off one of the sons😕
Bro
Thank God we killed the main villain. Because I'm sure there's no way to upload his personality into another cloned body. right.
The baby screaming? Chefs kiss, perfection!
The Rock could have been a better villain in this film but they instead put him on a whaling crew 😂
Grab some Villain Pub socks before March 31st! http://freakerusa.com/hishe
0:40 I like how Ronal immediately starts healing Kiri.  In canon, Neytiri had to talk Ronal into healing Kiri.
🎶 THANK YOU FOR WATCHINGGGGGG😭😭😭😭😭 🎶
Titanic in the background😂
Right. Break soldier's armor with a spear! Hmm... can he break a tank with it?
Make another httyd hishe
_SO MANY PROBLEMS.SEQUEL BAIT_
Why harvest whale brains, when you can just transfer your consciousness into avatars, you probably don't even need to make them blue, you could probably have a super model avatar
It is James Cameron’s Idea if avatar you don’t get to change it!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I actually expect this video would be longer, but it's better than nothing, right?
Look pal, I would love buy villains, pub socks but my mom wouldn’t like it she said i’m not allowed to watch it so I just need villains pub socks for Christmas and I like you guys
The whole ending of that movie was on the boat, off the boat, on the boat, off the boat
HoW cAn A wHAle uSe a GuN oMfG
I'm confused why Jake was like "oh we need to leave the clan we're part of that Neytiri and our children were born in to protect the clan and our family" but then at the end the water chief is like "you're part of our clan now" and Jake's just like "ok we'll stay then."
WATER CHIEF GO!!!
2:10 I couldn’t stop laughing 😂😂😂😂 nice reference guys!!!!
Por favor, faça vídeos legendados em português do Brasil, vocês tem muitos fãs aqui.
I litterly got a trailer for the mario bro movie for an ad
Bummer as it looks like the goal won't be meet for the socks. I purchased it but I guess I will be getting a refund.   Disappointed as supporting quality accounts like this should be embraced.
"I have done it!" I'm dead. 😂
the way you introd your merch was awesome
This sure felt like a classic HISHE, quick action sequences, everyone yelling and making the sound effects and whoever added the Titanic bit deserves a raise.
yes
What's the name of that Beat in the end? Somebody help
Right! I always wonder why does it feels less climatic with less action pack than the first one. After I saw this vid I remember, "Oh yeah the other troops just went away and vanished and they call themselves armies...oh what a fought...duh..."
So was this the ultra profitable sequel he claimed it would be?
2:23 - lol Titanic in the background!
Not to mention that the villain was restored from a backup. So...why didn't they just do that with Jake's brother before the first movie thus never needing him to come at all?
0:22 the googly eyes completes this scene.
I was going to watch the whale tonight.  Damn cartoons.
Love how the ONLY problem i had with the movie was the only scene lmao
Should've included a scene where Grace tells Kiri that Eywa is her father. Like, we all know that that's going to be the case.
Oh, it's actually "Ma Jake", not "My Jake".    ...what?
Well the main villains dead again. But don't worry they can clone a new one.  In fact they can clone an army of em.
Is nobody going to mention the Whale reference???
I really didn't get why they didn't swim under the fire for real tho
What's wrong with papyrus?
People from the titanic were here
Bro this video has a richer vocabulary broooo...was so annoying the kids saying "bro" over and over
Fraser's cameo caught me of guard
The way Ronal (Water Chief’s Wife) went, “I HAVE DONE IIIIIT 😀” 0:49
I actually like the original ending better but this is surprisingly good
According to imdb there will be 5 movies in all. Hopefully we won't have to wait another 13 years for the next movie but only 2 years between each one.
Amazing lol😂
Surprised nobody’s mentioned the fact that Jake and co left the rock people and moved to the water people specifically to avoid war… only to literally bring war on their doorstep. And nobody cared! The family didn’t seem guilty, the water villagers practically ignored it— I think only the pregnant chief lady was mad! And the fact that they ditched the one human kid (who literally got kidnapped and everyone forgot about him?! They just moved house!)… ig the Jake fam don’t really care (about anything). Perhaps it’s a deleted scene or something?
I was thinking the same, they should have just swum under the fire, maybe they just didn't know, as they weren't native water people? And most of the water people already disappeared because the battle was already won I think. I still thoroughly love that movie.
“Odinsleep” i love it
Yeah, movie never explained what unobtainium does or why they can’t clone the whales. Movie should explain why the villains want the thing they do
Best Sock Commercial ever. 😂
Why does the tulkun HAVE A BLICKY?!?!?😭
I know it's weird that the one dude wasn't around to save his daughter
😆😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣shut up garvin
Those are good points
Damn! Y'all already got me with the odin sleep ref
Lol it's so funny
Damn, the voice actor for Quaritch was perfect
1:11 I was wondering if the unborn baby was having any thoughts about this whole battle, now I know 🤣👍
Dear hishe creator how was hishe created
OMG THIS IS GENIUS
Wait were is neteyam?
I accept this as cannon lol
not the whale XDDDDDDDD
A.I. Artificial intelligence. The blue fairy turns out to be real and makes David into a real boy and there he is at the bottom of the ocean with no way out, a limited air supply, no food, and no bathroom.
2:10 this both scares me and makes me feel sad
Real ending: human ships just burn the whole place down with their engines. Planet cleansed. End of story.
2:40 the titan crew just sat there on the ship XD I’m dying this is amazing
Wait the whale guy lost an arm lol, still why is eternal youth worth only 18 million a whale plus that is what's funding the whole mission.  Either intergalactic space get really cheap in the future or someone didn't want to in depth in economic lol
The last thirty min was such a bore . It killed a great movie
They did a 3 hour film in 4 minutes. Well less than 4 not counting ads.
The first movie was about saving the rainforest. The second movie was about saving the whales. I bet the third one will be about recycling.
I mean, literally everthing rubbed me the wrong way in this movie, but sure, I guess that it works too
Can you pls make a Oscar hishe with Wakanda forever
kinda underwhelming ...btw the socks joke aint funny
What is the music at the end?
Yes !!! Thank you lol
Jajajaj muy bueno 👍
Notice jack and rose at 2:40
Jake sully should have snapped quaritch’s neck underwater, neytiri should have sneak attacked quaritch instead of use spider as bait and spider should not have saved quaritch
Ausitm
Clone the whales, and then kill the clones of the whales! :-)
31 is my B-day
❤️
Stranger as how the film industry is in decline so is this channel, still good content tho.
Spider was raging bro
Request: Can you a HISHE vid about Winnie-the-Pooh Blood & Honey?
The Humans instead should have just Nuked the Na'vi Resistance.
guys but they didnt mean in the film they saw the ship of jake friends they find ship of the hunters
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
1:20 That's exactly what I though. You kill a disarmed foe that won't hurt anybody anymore and consider yourself as part of the good guys...
Roses are red,  Violence is in strife,  2:12
I’m now convinced that Lo’aks cahchfrase is Bro
how are they not all blind i mean they looked at a star for 5mins
Waiting for Black Panther Wakanda should ended
The MOVIEEEEE!!!!
Something about the style of animation feels like that one cool math game where you have to make burgers and serve it to people
Can't believe they referenced The Whale with Brendan Fraser
When she says Sky People, it sounded like Skype People.
For a sprawling military complex, it sure seems undergunned…  No: Tanks, Theatre Artillery, Combat Aircraft (other than rotor aircraft), Orbital Satellites, Automated Turrets/Security Systems…
Another ending is: they just forget about Jake and his family))) and just go after pandora from other part of the planet))
Bro the tulkun shooting the boat got me ngl 😂😂🤣🤣
on the whole, Avatar 2 story is dump
2:12 hahahahahaha i love the reference.
is neteyam alive? 😭
Might all the humans who arrive not be impacted by the intense radiation and gravity from being next to a gas giant akin to Jupiter?? Also getting back to earth and bringing the elixir of life must take some time unless even faster than light travel exists (and the marines still use bullets...) Meantime the elixir buyers are now dead from old age?? Luckily unobtanium is not needed to solve the earths energy crisis anymore. All that effort for nothing...
So none of the hunters considered extending their own lives with the fluid? Oh and you know hunting the whales never worked well on earth so it would be different on pandora?
Do Puss In Boots The Last Wish
We can just take off and clone em' in Orbit...
2:55 most logical thing
Err this is one HISHE episode that ain’t funny. Been a fan up till now. Maybe we can get a How HISHE should have ended episode?
This makes me wanna watch the movie again
That last bit about cloning whale brains…actually, though. I’m a geneticist and I promise you we could mass-produce that stuff without harming any whales even with today’s technology.
"WATER CHEAF GO!" XD
But Jake's first son still dying???(((((
Omg Clone Whales theory!
I hate that people are defending this movie lmao. Over a decade and it’s the same plot with the same antagonist 😂😂😂
I like how the end basically highlights how bad the writing is… and James Cameron brainwashes and influences people with the effects. Avatar are not good films but people see pretty things and get confused like children 🤣
Jake
Cant wait for the next Villain Pub episode
One thing I didn't like was the fact that the crew of the boat are basically just civilian government contracted employees, yet their didn't hesitate to commit the war crimes and straight up fight and war along side the Marines. I mean if I were on that boat crew I'll would've taken the first dingney nearby before the locals started mounting up to attack and be like: "I'm a Civilian, not a soldier, I don't get paid to k@ll and commit war crimes, I get paid to operate this ''fishing" boat and hunt whales. I ain't risking my life for something I didn't sign up for" but instead all of those fishers and boaters were like "Well since the Marines on our boat are fighting em guess we'll join in too."
I was expecting them to address the fact that Neytiri threatened to kill spider... ya know, her adopted son. Because even though she and Jake treat him like a pet, Jake calls him a Stray cat in the intro, he was still raised by the, with their biological children. They had no issue adopting Kiri, Na'vi are presented as more loving and open minded than humans, Jake used to be human, Neytiri is bonded to a transcultural immigrant. I realize that the Omatikaya, and the Na'vin in general have a lot of hatred and trauma to unpack from the first movie... and I'm not trying to disregard their feelings or history....   But they essentially ruined this child and don't want to take responsibility for him. He was born on Pandora, native and ingrained in the culture and language, one with nature. He is a Na'vi trapped in a human body and if he goes anywhere else, he's dead. He can never go to earth and doesn't have ties there, Pandora is his home.  I could write a dissertation paper, but this is a YouTube comment.
I've watched this HISHE so many times, but I'm now seeing the Titantic cameo at 2:42 😂
The Baby in Ronals Belly 🤣🤣
jack and rose on sinking ship ....
In anticipation for The Flash, which will be released on June 16th this year, there should be a HISHE for Batman 1989 and Batman Returns.
In anticipation of The Super Mario Bros. movie and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, a HISHE for The Tomorrow War should be made. It is my favorite Chris Pratt movie, and one part actually made me cry.
I love the HISHE continuity all the way back to the first Thor movie HISHE.
This i so cool and the only way I care the watch any semblance of this film lol
I like the font.
Humanity should have won, I mean with all this futuristic technology and weaponry we should time and time again whipe out the Na'vi
I saw The Beginning Of The First One, Long And Boring. I Cut My Loses. I Love Your Takes On Them Though!!!
THE WHALE WITH THE GLOCK KILLED MEEEE 1:23
the whale lol
Total bligger death
I wish Spider didn’t save him in the real movie cause there’s a possibility he may come back and it will be boring with the same old people
Now you think about it. Why even clone the whales? They have advanced cloning tech. They have consciousness transfer tech.  They harvested the whale brain juice for longevity applications.  Isn't it cheaper and faster to clone the "age Treatment" client. And transfer his or her consciousness to a younger body?  Furthermore. They are trying to colonize pandora, but humans can breath the atmosphere. Wouldn't it make sense to use the same cloning/hybridization tech we know they have to make humans able to breath in Pandora without equipment? I mean it should be easier than making Avatars. According to the lore pandoran creatures still breath Oxygen. It's just that the composition of the atmosphere and density of o2 is different. Seems to me its a step closer than making a bluespacecat dude with the face and voice of its pilot. 🤷‍♂️
the ending song is impressive
Bro I mean dad 💀
Why do not clone a new whatever body in the first place, when you can load the memories and kind of the personality in it?
Нейтири спокойно летела против пуль как в индийском кино а вот ее стрелы попадали прямо в цель.
Fantastic
Hey there again number one fan here
YAY!!!!
A whale holding a gun and a angry baby that’s funny.
Let's not forget that the entire point of the movie is Jake and his family learning the Way of Water, yet only the kids seem to have mastered how to control their breathing underwater, to the point that the entire ship escape boils down to "oh no, some of them can't hold their breath for long enough!!"
A mounted C-Ram on that ship would have annihilated everything on its path! The movie was disappointing! First one was better.
Who else would like to see “How Puss in boots the last wish Should Have Ended”?😊
1:12  for those who haven’t seen the movie. YES, that baby scene was in the movie just like that
I’d like a HISHE of this where they come back and just drop tungsten rods from orbit on the major population centers. That’s what I’d do in the human’s place. It would also leave the planet largely habitable (aside from those areas directly impacted).
You did not have to do Brendan Fraser like that 😂
Jack rose on titanic was good.
Or why doesn’t all of humanity just download their consciousness into Navii clone bodies so that they can all live on pandora as opposed to having to reconstruct the planet to match earth. They said that earth was dying early on in the movie
This is new level!!
Princess Mononoke had a much better message!
Anyone realizes that Kiri is basically alien Jesus? She born without a mother and she is practically the incarnation of Eywa (God)
Avatar is now the worse movie of this year.
this movie was so bad, it actually hurts watching it
DID YOU WATCH AVATAR? I LIKE AVATAR!
And Neteyam lived :)
That's logical, isn't it?
The way of water.... until the end when the characters forget they just spent the last 3 hours learning how to swim.
Did they actually just reference the Whale from the movie?
Why is 1:00 the most accurate James Cameron action scene I’ve ever seen.
that's exactly what i was thinking while watching. "where the F those water warriors go ??? And they had trained to hold breath for a long time. Why wouldn't they go under the flames ?? Or call their flying creatures"
I kept a running joke with my friends and fam about how I've had multiple oppurtunities to watch "Avatar 2" but I chose to watch any other movie, including "The Whale" so I didnt expect that to be quoted lol  Note: still havnt seen Avatar 2. Gonna wait til it drops on disney plus
So many missed opportunities in this video! Could’ve been way funnier.
My thoughts exactly. They can make hybrids, but they can't clone an alien whale?
Lol the whale reference 😂😂😂😂
The Whale reference was amazing.
3:25
If they can clone Na'vi and transfer memories to them, why not just clone humans and transfer memories to them.  Death solved!
I have an even better idea…clone people and just transfer the consciousness into a new fresh body! No perfidious whale juice needed! But that would be too logical and we need a Whaling bad lecture dressed up as a movie
Odin's sleep.
Something tells me Dr Here’s-A-Big-Idea stayed on Earth, _Away_ from all the idiots in the RDA…
Wiya angwa yaymak
Not the Brendan Fraser disrespect bro 😭
The Titanic sinking in the background with Jack and Rose was beautiful.
THE WHALE REFERENCE SENT ME LMFAO
so great to also see the nav'i baby screaming in the battle
2:08 EXACTLY WHERE DID THE WATER PEOPLE GO
💙
and you still didn't save Neteyam
Honestly yea
I like that interaction between tonraq and Miles lol
Yeah, plot isn't the strong suit of Avatar
I havent laughed that hard at a youtube video in quite a while, it's heavily contextual but that whale joke is just on another level 🤣
the whale reference was beautiful
It’s like you guys don’t want avatar three
Lol still I’ve this movie :)
2:49 Lmao. They actually joked about the papyrus font.
where is 'glass the whole site before landing' joke?
I very much enjoyed this but I will say the reason why they can’t clone a Tulkan is because their brains and possibly the rest of their bodies are more complicated than the Na’vi.
LMAO NOT THE WHALE
I was expecting an Aquaman navi momosa dude to appear
remember the navi only destroyed a whaling party with little to no air support and whaling equipment. we would hand their asses back to them if they attacked our base...unless the navi have a serious condition of plot armour
Seeing the comment section makes me happy that I was not the only one that saw every plot hole on it
Lmfao!!! The whale coming out of the water with a gun and shooting the boat was epic…I look forward to these more than the movies.
Avatar 2: this time it’s wet
I already know the battle plot hole but man the whale cloning the make total sense
I loved the whale ref so much
Finally I have seen the true ending thank you
1:02 I thought this was avatar, not a… not a… umm, not a micheal bay movie!
Hi..... Please can you do antman and the wasp  quantumina??   By. Marvel fan ❤️
"I need to know that i have done one thing right in my life" damn this line is so emotional. Brendan fraser nailed it.
there was so much more potential for this hishe
Honestly, this was so bad that I skipped half of this!!
I like how the outro song is like the Weeknd’s song in the end credits 😭
Is it wierd that no one noticed Jack and rose can be spotted in the background on the sinking ship...
who is you favorite fearless hero                      Opinion: but I can see why puss is better than avatar
The Whale reference lmao
MY JAKEEEEE
I want to see how rise at the TMNT the movie should have ended
I was waiting for this , finally
that was so annoying how jake called norm to come and help and just forgot that the signal of the chopper would get noticed.
man i thought you have included a couple of lines why we did upgrade the plexie glass to be stronger than their arrows or something and not again ow ships went down so quickly/also why orbital bombardment or send in drones first etc
+ Neteyam is saved
That bit with Brendan Fraser's The WHALE was perfect; on so many levels!😄
I hated avatar
New video is out is amazing
This movie was visually appealing with zero brain cells
tbh, I would have just made a Jake Sully clone to get the bad guys to leave everyone alone. Gaslight the Jake clone into thinking it's real and convince itself to sacrifice itself for everyone. That way, the bad guys "think" they got what they wanted and they just "finish' their job. Real Jake would be in their version of witness protection and no one would be the wiser.  **My logic is purely based on the fact they cloned the previous villain back to life with almost all of his memories intact.
You know, I didn't see this movie and I can't tell whether the levels of unhingedness are accurate or not
Unobtainablubber
this is so true but also shut up about the font already lmaooo
My biggest thing is, why should I care if the bad guy is dead? They grew him in a tube and downloaded his brain from a jump drive...make a whole army of him. Grow like 400 of him. He literally has a respawn button.
Bro just forgot neteyam
Also, they could just transfer their consciousness into a younger clone
Awesome!!!
I immediately decided to buy the socks... 🙃😁
What about neteyam ????=))))
Payakan 🤣🤣🤣
Bro! 😂
The whale creature with the pistols 😂😂
I watched this video because I had watched the sequel of Avatar in theater with my family and found myself how the film is exactly overrated and making no sense.
Socks!
1:43  Why wasn’t this in the movie XD
Right off the bat, I died of laughter at 0:22 when Neteyam hit Jake with "Bro! I mean, Dad!"😂😂
I know it's not a superhero movie, but I was low key expecting a "because I'm batman" to pop up at some point. Lol 😅
The ending should be the humans won.
still attacking papyrus I see 🤣
Waiting for Wakanda forever hishe
Humans have been raising cattle, chickens, and pigs for meat for millenia. They could have done the same with the magic whales. Don't get why they had to keep hunting them instead of simply building a giant aquarium and raising them there. Would probably be a lot more humane as well.
I’m sorry but the baby in the womb doing the battle cry got me to actually LOL
They don't bother cloning whale brains because then immortality would be cheap. Can't make money if there's no scarcity
where is the "BECAUSE I'M BATMAN" LINE
PAPYRUS
20th Century Studios
Im just noticing Jack and the titanic
The cloning point they made at the end devastated me
What about using that whale 🐋 "brain 🧠 Gol" to heal or bring Neytam back to life!!!😅😅😅
I've watched this video the first day but kept coming back because of Kiri, her face went having a seizure is the funniest thing I ever seen 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Yeah bro
the movie was so bad
Avatar 2: Water Boogaloo
You should have put Chief's wife instead of Rose on Titanic, because the actress is Kate Winslet on both. Easter egg
As soon as they showed that the reason for the poaching was for Whale Brain Juice™ my first thought was ".....why not just clone them back on earth. That would save time and money....."  Kinda like the first movie when they said that the whole point of getting the Navi to leave their tree was so that they could mine up some ore, my first thought was "Why not start the mine shaft back at your base and just dig under the tree, not disturbing anyone....we literally already do that on earth now, they can't do that in the future?"   Kinda like........if you have the technology to mentally scan someone and create an Avatar with their personality and memories (up to the point of scanning) like they do in the second movie............why do remote controlled avatars exist in the first place? Like in the first movie, the only reason Jake was there was cus his brother died and he was a genetic match for his avatar......but if they could just upload his brother's consciousness into the avatar to begin with....why didn't they just do that.....with ALL the avatars...... And you can't use the argument that it's new tech, because they scanned Quaritch's brain for the purposes of uploading it into an Avatar before his final fight in the first movie......   These movies LOOK beautiful....but story-wise they make NO sense........
Do I see jack and rose in the background 😂
The anti aging plot didn't make sense.  They can clone bodies and then transfer their memories.  Why would you need anti aging medicine?
The amount of flaws in this movie is why puss in boots was better
Monkey boy.
I can't decide which I like better: The pistol-packing sea beast, or the whale.
Umm you didn’t change netayam dying to him idk … SURVIVING and living a long life like he deserves
I never considered cloning the brains...  Probably not easy, since making spider silk is incredibly difficult...but they could make na'avi bodies... So... That's not unreasonably economical...  However... insulin is easy to make yet super expensive for profit...so more capitalism might be why... 🤔
I just want the socks and not the beer koozie...
I'm guessing wb didn't like you guys using superman and batman in the cafe
There is two people on sinking ship, why didn't the na vi save them.
Water Chief go!
Could also just clone people, and transfer their consciousness.
Well, when you take into account that Spears (a thrust orientated weapon that requires you to be up close to your opponent) and harpoons (which don’t require AS much close range to be effective and can’t carry as many with you since they’re so big compared to arrows) aren’t ideal when fighting people with guns. Besides, even if they could recollect their harpoons and spears from kills, it’s a lot harder to dislodge them than it is arrows. They most likely left because they at least when back to the village to restock on weapons. I’d imagine they came back because The Sullies would’ve needed help bringing Neteyam back to the village since a Tsurak, an Ikran or an Ilu wouldn’t be appropriate for carrying a dead body.
When I tell u I never fell asleep so many times in the movie theater
NOT THE WHALE
papyrus, bruv?
Probably the same reason for whale oil . In ww2 Nazis used whale oil in their planes . And didn't need to be replaced.. our new oil today tries to be a synthetic replacement but is not even close..
Where is batman !!!!!
Didnt watch the real film, it seems boring
expect more
Jake looks like batman
its funny how puss in boots was better than the new avatar
Did anyone else notice how convenient the ikran were? Where were they chilling the whole movie? Neytiri just summons hers like a Pokémon before the big fight and that's it.
The whale with the gun got me 😅
Adding more reason to why calling the "Sky People Friends" was unnecessary:  All they did was say that Kiri MIGHT have epilepsy and it's NEVER brought up again
I was wondering where the water people went i thought when it turned night there were "okay were going home to sleep your job now screw you jake"
The scene where the whale pulled out a freaking revolver killed me XD.
Papyrus...
I love this show!!! Please make Villain Pub again please.
Next video request: how Babylon should've ended
Bro plz tell when avatar the way of water will release on ott and vod?
Also the bad guys kinda just forgot they had hostages when the Navi attacked. What suddenly the "morality" of the ruthless bad guys prevented them from gunning down the kids?
Yeah clone the brains aholes
It should have ended 1 hour earlier
Jack and Rose on sinking ship sent me flying 😭😭
2:10 Ok, that reference kill'd me 🤣🤣🤣
All of this, for sure. And also the fact that cloning technology means that they could just keep bringing back Quaritch and his buddies again and again ... or heck, they could just make a whole army of Quaritches!
I think you forgot that Jermaine Clement did an American accent in this movie for whatever reason
" ODIN SLEEP" 0:46 😂😂
That movie is full of plot holes.
LMAO jack and rose at 2:41
Quaritch shouldve died and new antagonist shouldve been made
You know the movie is a masterpiece when Even HISHE couldn't come up with an ending that makes sense. 🤯
The “Odin sleep” right at the start was perfect
I was wondering why the colonel kept after Jake when he was supposed to be stopping the resistance leader, who was no longer Jake
Honestly, it shouldn't have started in the first place
Effects are amazing in this movie but story is pathetic.
bro, i saw titanic drowning but I saw jake and rose . lmao
I HAVE DONE IIIIIT. Idk why but I started laughing uncontrollably and can't watch the rest of the video
All hail Papyrus
Can we get a HISHE for Fox's Legion
The weirdest part about the tribe just leaving is that they staight up left the cheifs daughter and that was like 90% of the reason, they saw her got off the ship and just left  Imagine getting vigilantes to fight against a hostage situation with your daughter, and they let her walk to the door, so you just leave to see her at home, WHAT?!
The excessive use of the word bro in this movie made so much worse
It should have ended an hour and a half earlier
Do the flash trailer!
I'll say this again...I'm so glad you guys watch these movies so I don't have to, and yet I feel like I did after watching your videos. Keep up the good work!
Ronal's baby was hilarious and seeing Brendan Fraser as a whale was so random 😂
I'm sure this point of ideas are original
It's actually what I was thinking while I was watching the movie😅 Where did the water tribe army go after battle? They just vanished! Why don't they just swim under the fire!
Awsome. That's Awsome.
2:10 Bruh 😂😂
The whale reference 🤣🤣🤣
How about the Humans just doing an Orbital Bombardment of the Planet
Ronal’s weird healing ritual in the background was too funny 😂😂  Also very impressed that they got the water clan’s accents right! Well done Hishe and love those socks but I don’t think they ship in my part of the globe 😿
Great ending.😂😂😂😂
I need to know That i've done one thing right with my life
This would be really funny if I remembered anything that happened in Avatar 2
I wish they had killed off the military guy and just kept bringing back clones of him.
What's so weird is that this movie made 2b!!!
If you can can you do Incredible Hulk movie next please
The Weeknd song remake 🤣
Brendan Fraser as Payakan was the best thing on HISHE I’ve seen in a while
Also why don’t they use those airbag fish all the time?
I Hate Quaritch as a Na'vi and I Hate the music of the sequels.
Kiri’s face for the seizure was too funny
When I watched the movie in theatres, I ahd to pee during the middle when the whole daughter who's name I can't remember scene went down so that really got a good laugh out of me
WHERE'S BATMAN!!
2:44 love the detail where metkayna chief is swimming metkayna way  and rest of them our way.
2:41 jack & Rose
I thought this channel does. Great to see u back 😅
Jermaine's Kiwi/Americanish Accent was spot on.
This movie didn’t not have the plot capable of keeping the crowd entertained for a 3 and a half hour runtime. I walked out to go get dinner at one point. Came back and couldn’t believe how little of a dent I made
Why does it feel like they aren't putting the effort into these videos anymore
They should have nuked them from orbit
This movie is so bad, I don't understand how it's the third highest grossing movie of all time..
Should have done puss in boots instead
I haven't watched a movie yet
LMAO NOT BRENDON FRASER POPPING UP😭
Well, look, all Na'vi and Spider were sailing from the ship.  Jake's family doesn't know what it is or why it's on fire. They are scared and don't know what to do.  They ask the Spider, who himself does not know.  It is unlikely that he was taught physics on Pandora by the people who remained there.  Therefore, everyone swam from the fire to the ship.  They climbed on it, and Tuk was washed down somewhere, and the scene started.  Regarding Jake's friends, who flew in a helicopter to help Kiri, this is his mistake.
Bro I love the new lyp sync for black Adam ⚫
🤣 1:00 - 1:30  intense asf 🤣 Idk what really happened in the movie to inspire 30 seconds of WTF?! 🤣
I've literally clicked the like button 3 times 😅
Make Hishe on RRR.
I walked out of this movie after 20 minutes of underwater footage. I'm glad I missed the rest of this
2:10 okay I get it its the paria whale who come to the rescue....but WHY THIS FACE ? I dont have the reference.
The whale face makes me remember the Walrus movie lol
Have you stopped doing HISHE dubs?
How about black panther wakanda for ever.. and antman quantumania?
So the second movie had an even weaker plot than the first one good to know I definitely won't waste my money on this now
Payakan poppin up with the fuckn strap had me dying
bro the odin sleep part got me rolling🤣🤣
BRUH ADDED JACK AND ROSE 😭😭
Yoyo
This movie was genius Can’t wait for the next avatar films
Please make Justice society cartoon!
Bro...... I mean Dad 😂😂😂
2:11 absolutely genius this is such a layered masterpiece of writing
Love the series, still confused why they vanished in last part of fight. Did they think sully died? Who knows. Enjoyed movie looking forward to more. Also good job with Navi seizure face. Made me laugh more than I should
This video was far more engaging than the entire movie. Had to leave it in the middle even though the tickets were expensive
I bet you $4815162342 you didnt read that number. You just skipped over it. You didnt even realize I put a letter in it. No, I didnt, but you went back and looked :)  ..subscri b
1:25 Aquaman?
The water is on fire! Quick, back on the sinking ship!!
Fun Fact: Ronal in Avatar: The Way of Water is played by Kate Winslet (aka Rose in Titanic)
Ha, I saw those Titanic characters you put there.  That was great.
Could you make one of Wakanda forever please. :( if you want
Tulkun with the revolver 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Though they would brought up the Black Box with the memories of Quarrich. Like, just like in this video, he get a spear in the chest and it cut right back to a pod with a new body already ready.
this movie looked so awesome. but not awesome enough to make up for the horrible plot with holes as big as Kansas, absolute stupidity, completely forced on white people are bad ideology and the underwhelming performances and bad writing of the characters. also, you could easily say what's gonna happen next because they blatantly stole the plot AND scenes from 10 movies and stitched them together like a 2nd grader would(no noffense to anyone in 2nd grade). They should have just showed 2 h of wildlife shots from Pandora in 3D. Maybe get someone with a famous voice to comment it. but it was succesful o who am i to talk...
When Yusuf from Inception (also Max) *really* drank too much champagne
Oh damn!!!!!! That whale and that baby was so unexpected!!!! Frick you guys gotta keep coming up with ideas like this😂
Don't clone them, breed them and extract the substance
Those water effects are really next level 🎚️🎚️🎚️
I find it funny that in the first movie Neytiri was all about saving her tribe and everything,  but as soon as Jake is like we need to run and hide so the bad sky people cant find us and she just leaves everything behind for him... like what? lol
THE WHALE REFERENCE KILLED ME
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰♥️
Cloning whales brain would be so much expensive and killing them is simple..it's like we can clone chicken meat but it's easy to kill a chicken..
Forget this movie I want to see a movie about the whales banding together to fight the sky people
“So why wouldn’t they just grow in a lap?“   “So the movie can happen sir”   “Of course! must be pretty hard to grow these brains though“  “No actually it’s gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience”
The unborn baby will be a great warrior some day
I love Avatar the way of the water so much that i didnt realise how long it is
James Cameron already did the swim under the fire movie in True Lies.
did any one see jack and rose
I thought you'll bring Neteyam back 😢
And i love the sock song !
Maaannnn that was goooddddd
Do morbius you cowards. You know what the batfans have been waiting for
make a new villian pub episode
Char...Char...Charlie!?
Don't forget your socks.  THat song was a bop
1:27 I laughed so hard 😂😂
Yeah seriously where did the water tribe go?
Lets be honest, the reason this movie got successful like the first one is because the villains were totally referencing the US spreading freedom to Native people. Thats why its so successful in China.
still Papyrus
Anyone else saw jack and rose in 2:41 ? 🐸
I do see why Cameron was nervous about the release because he knew the plot was pretty shaky. He was hoping the awesome graphics would help him pull out another win and that's exactly what happened.
The Titanic sinking in the background, lol
Can you do Wakanda forever please
The Titanic sinking in the background!!!!!!! I'M DYING!!!!
So I'm not the only one wondering where the water people went
The guy at the ended should have said they should give up lower the aging process to just achieve immortality by uploading memories into cloned bodies.
I am still weirded out about the fact that apparently no one noticed that, in this movie, neither Jake nor the bad guy knew how to do the breath under water technique, and yet, their final battle was one trying to choke the other... underwater... I mean... how does that even work? None of them are breathing anyway! Does choking the other causes them negative breathing points so they lose their breath faster than not breathing?? XD
How it really should have ended:  Business dude from first movie: oh boys I’m back.   (Releases nukes)  Jake the traitor: oh shi-
Love it
Are we gonna ignore the fact that there was the sinking scene from Titanic in the background when they were about to swim under the fire?
This isn't even half of the problems I had with this movie.   Seriously, I hated Avatar 2
I love to watch your video
Rose and Jack😂
Do you make a video of Wednesday or squid game please, did you the how should stranger things, sooooooo
My only complaint about this movie is that they didn't say the word "Bro" enough times.
Avatar is the best movie!
Normal baby screaming)
I literally have no words for the Brendan Fraser cameo 😂😂😂😂
Not Jack and Rose on top the ship!😂🤣💀
Just  Saying,  When's the  ant  Man  Quantumania  Hishe?
Hishe next show on youtube
I love this show so much jake sally is good guy last year 2022 i watch in movie theaters avatar movie called seed of beared they do seed ps jake sally save by friend spider he is guy so thank you friend i see what next how it shoud have ended show youtube
Oh my God, I cannot stop laughing
That's exactly how it should have ended.
My biggest question about this movie is, why sky people didn't clone the oceanic na'vi species? Why only the jungle one?
Nah y’all straight up gave the whale a gun! 🤣🤣💀
“Bro, I mean Dad!” Didn’t waste any time! 🤣🤣
2:50 PAPYRUS!!!!
Да они там все бессмертные. И не надо было спасать этого Куориджа, чтобы сохранить злодея на следующие серии. Просто клонировать ещё раз. А вот Джейка Салли в живых уже нет. Это ведь не его аватар, а брата. Гены, конечно, идентичны и сознание его было перенесено. Но всё равно, он растит своих племянников, а не детей
0:10 Voldemort: I don't _wear_ socks! Me: you *SHOULD!*
Oh shoot I need to get some socks
better yet clone ppl and transfer their memory.
Thank you for saving three hours of my life.
Dances With Smurfs 2 The Way Of The Snorks
I miss the frequent skits from the cafe and pub. I still love the actual episodes, I just wish there was more cafe and pub time.
I never understood why the sequel still used the "Avatar"  Name, since the first guy gave up his old body.  Thus the avatar body became his only body.  Thus no longer technically an avatar. Though nice of it to be about waterbenders though.
0:07 I want those Freakers so Freakin’ much it ain’t even funny!
This movie left me unsatisfied.
I haven't seen this movie but I figured this'll do it's job
First
Where is the Super cafe?🤔
Other things wrong in this movie : Why humans would leave the forest in peace when there is still metal under the tree? Why would humans only want revenge against Jake and not the scientists who stayed in the forest ? Why humans don't use flying ships in this movie when it offres a great avantage? How does symbiotics creatures work under water? How does it gives air to the Naavi? Does it work with the link in their hair ? In that case, can't they use it as diving snorkel? Why does Jake say to his children to live as their new people if he doesn't do it himself? Hé didn't know how to swim long time underwater when his son taught him. How is it possible they find several giant fishes miles away when they can't see one just under their boat?
This might be the best one yet…. Love “the whale” reference!!
HELP
What did we learn about the Navei to help us in this next battle? How about we make the cockpit cover strong enough to withstand there giant arrows, that would really help out.
"I'll call my scientist friends to help" "With what bro?" "It's not explained" lol 🤣
PAPYRUS
Love how you guys make fun of Lo'ak and Neteyam saying "bro" all the time
Omg the whale😂😂😂
That's - too - SHORT !!!!
I've wondered why they all didn't prepare for the eventual return of the sky people, and just slaughtered them all as soon as they landed.
😂😂 this is the swimming under water water movie
Nothing about Spider saving his clone daddy? Who might possibly kill another family member of his in a future movie and make him regret saving?
That Brendan Fraser joke was a work of art. Oscar worthy! The slow realization of what was actually happening....hilarious.
THANK YOU for the scene where you pointed out the water people mysteriously disappearing! 1 scene I kinda wish you added was instead of Neteyam putting down the gun before climbing the rail and jumping in water, he could have maybe go over the rail while still shooting with 1 hand to keep himself covered so he'd survive(who knows, maybe can do part 2 with something similar?😇)
More better would have be... Human came, detect the living area of Jake, using an orbital kinetic strike to wipe out his tribe and all living around him. Go to a other place of the planet and take over. Oh, and why didn't humans learned to enforce their cockpits
Next how Ant Man and Wasp Quantamania should have ended
This came out really too late.. All the points mentioned were already covered by honest trailers and other channels...  HISHE have lost their Game... I am little disappointed
TITANITC
Well, that’s saves three more hours of my increasingly limited time. 🙄😂🖖🐢
Hey, we need more villain pub series
The song at the end is the best part
I cringed in the theater every time the kids said "bro"
2:10 The Whale joke really made me laughed so hard 🤣🤣
this is PERFECT!!!!! seeing Jack & Rose on the sinking ship had me 🤣🤣🤣
Jack and rose hidden on the ship during the sinking ship scene
You totally missed a chance to have Palps say “Execute Order Soxty-Six!”
Having not seen the movie, I am very confused
I promise you Neteyam was too OP
So glad I skipped this movie. If the plot holes and lack of character are this big...? Just like the first one, just razzle dazzle.
I was hoping for a Nick Fury cameo to recruit Kiri to join the Avengers.
The first movie was about Earth 🌎, while the sequel was about Water 🌊. That leaves either Fire 🔥 or Air 🌪next. 😅😅😅
Amazing as always. I don't plan on watching the movie so this is canon to me.
"Papyrus!"
Amen
Have try dubbed for Avatar movie
Bruh, you killed me with Jack and Rose in the back
Best add ever.
For a movie that was 3 HOURS I’d expect the HISHE to be WELL over less than 4 MINUTES 🫤
i really want to know how "wakanda forever" should have  ended
The screaming baby killed me 😂
0:41 I can’t with her in the back 💀😭😭😭😭
Wow
The water people LITTERALLY SAID "This is your fight" they just wanted there daughter and that's all. Jake ALSO agreed that it was his fight... Why does no one remember this?
Actually, Hishe's first point is not correct. You could clearly see them carrying electronic equipment into their new hut at the water people settlement. So they had the equipment to call for help. The question is rather how they transported it on the dragon, it didn't look like they had any luggage with them. And besides that, it should have taken hours for the humans to fly with the helicopter to their village. Hours without medical help for Kiri.
and what if it's Quasimodo Scary In Water 2: The big show in Sea Of Los Angeles?
The villain pub socks song SLAPS
I don't get why they wanted Jake captured/killed when he wasn't the leader any more. Or the fact there wasn't a global war happening with the two when that general lady said she was there to make the planet habitable. And i didn't get why spider or the bad guy even cared even a little to each other. Or how the bad guy survived being choked during a fight underwater and left to drown for like what seemed at least 5+mins. Or the bad guys plan to infiltrate the natives when it's was obvious it wasn't going to work.
Hey hishe, plz make how black Panther Wakanda forever should have ended pllz!!!! I watched all about it!!
“Bro! I mean dad” Lol😂😂😂
i pretty much predicted most of the movie besides when the humans had backup avatars
I was waiting for a Deep Blue Sea cameo ending...ummm you took our idea lol
Odinsleep!
I can't believe this guy is still doing this
OMG THE WHALE WTH
guy at the end isnt wrong. clone the wales would work.
The ad for socks shouldn't bang as hard as it does
I suddenly need Villian Pub socks
Are you going to keep using the screaming sheep sound effect EVERY TIME? I’ve heard it somewhere in the video, and I don’t appreciate this channel’s usage of the scream.
2:50 Yea, it looks like Papy- aaand SNL beat me to it.
the only time I'll be happy to get socks for christmas
I'm glad I skipped this 3+ hour CGI eye fetish fest from Cameron.
When Brendan Fraser rose up out of the water, bro…I laughed so hard almost blacked out
Where funny cat in boots?
The best movie ever I love this hishe funniest video
The Water Chief literally shoulda just stayed and helped. I didn’t even think about that. Also now that I think about, some of the people who worked on the movie definitely just made them not do the obvious solution for more run time. Hence thanks to this scene 2:48 😂
HISHE keeps hinting on nukes but I still see no nukes.
2:23 Titanic, Jack, and Rose are back!  Water: *Gets set on fire*  Rose: Jack! The water is on fire! Jack: Yeah, I can see that. Rose: we may not freeze after all! We may be ok. Jack: Sure Rose... OR WE'LL JUST BE BOILED AND COOKED IN THE WATER INSTEAD!
Do how Puss in Boots The Last Wish Should Have Ended next
I will always call it avatar the way of moist.
No ability for Hollywood to preach "their truth" if they simply cloned or sequenced the specified whale DNA. Preaching how you need to change is all the rage right now, not profits
Water chief gooo!
🦈 had a gun lol
Oh wow, was it really that bad? Lol
Im wating for the black oanther 2 hishe ☹
Yum Yum‘s Yum Hey why don’t you all write produce direct and fund your own movies so you can have them and as you would like why don’t you conduct your own life be respectful of how other people make movies
I watched this instead of the movie.
Also, who needs to slow aging when you can clone your original body and upload your memories/personality to it?  If they could do it with Avatar bodies they could do it with human ones. The humans already figured out how to cheat death.
HISHE I have a request. Please include a version of the scene where Tonowari scolds Lo'ak for befriending Payakan. When he was done ranting about 'The Tulkun way ', I wanted Lo'ak to go ' Yeah, but guess what? The Sky People are able to exploit the Tulkun so much because they don't fight back. If they went against their culture for once, they'd keep their lives and those of the future generations, who would be able to practice their culture forever after."
the tulkan holding a gun at 01:22 🤣
The whale joke!!! 🤣
That The Whale joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They introduced the creature that the Navi use to breathe under water. So why didn’t kiti get enough for everyone. No the whole end was I hope no one drowns. Yeshhhhh
♫ ♩ You are so wellllcommmmme.♫ ♩ ♫ ♩ It was kindaa funneeeeeeyy! ♫ ♩ ♫ ♩ But, ♫ ♩ ♫ ♩ I don't need socks. Sorry, oh, yea. ♫ ♩
I just can't beleive the roped Jemaine Clement into this.
Avatar 2 is a failure....I did fall asleep on the first hour...I thought I'm watching National Geographic...😕
They should have included Spider seeing Quaritch (that how it’s spelled?) underwater about to drown before just leaving him there 😂
00:50 That unborn baby screams tough! ❤️💀😂😂
En cuanto a la razón por la cual el jefe no estaba luchando, me imaginé que era porque él ya había destruido el barco grande y para él era más importante mantener a salvo su tribu que tratar asegurarse que todomundo en ese último barco muriera.
When will black Panther and flash trailer hishe available?
But i am not happy since there wasn't Batman and Superman in the end talking about the movie
Yeah, I've been wondering why they couldn't synthesize the chemical.
It should've ended in the first movie with the humans just landing and setting the forest on fire as they do in this movie
It's not enough that a movie is visually spectacular, it needs a solid screenplay, it needs to tell a story that is not a coolander.
Clone 1 avatar cost $5 billion "Let's clone some sea creature that 20 time avatar size for $80 milion juice boiz"  or clone buch of avatar soidler, that get one shot easily Bruh...
2:42 seeing the titanic sinking in the background with jack and rose is a funny reference to James Cameron titanic
0:47 “OODINNNN SLLEEEPPPPP”😭🤣
PAPYRUS
I honestly don't know what his friends were there for when the scene with them started like all they did was monitor her condition and give basic advice you could have gotten from basic observation
2:41 Jack & Rose in the background 😂💀
This movie was not that good, I was pretty disappointed. I think James Cameron has also gone woke.
Avatar 2: The Way of Water Avatar 3: The Way of Earth Avatar 4: The Way of Fire Avatar 5: The Way of Air
I think we just saved 30 minutes on this film! XD
That Villain Socks song is really catchy. It's stuck in my head!!! Make it stop!!!
PLEASEEE DO WAKANDA FOREVER
Humanity should have won. Make Factorio the movie instead. 😉
Oh yes lond time is funny part avatar 2 the way of the water 🚾lol😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone thought I was crazy when I said they said “Bro” too much🤣 IT DROVE ME INSANE
Love how the whale had a gun lol 😂😂👌
Ant-Man/QuantuMania SPOILER::         did you guys get Rise of Skywalker vibes?
Finally, another HISHE
Honestly this movie should be called The Way of Plot Holes because  1. If the humans can’t reach Jake because the planet’s immune response sends birds to attack their helicopters, why not use fighter jets? They would reach the cave and fire a missile killing Jake and the Navi well under 10 minutes, and if not, fighter jets can easily defeat giant wing flapping birds 2. If Jake wanted to protect his family, why did he bring two of his children into a active combat zone after provoking the humans? Also if they RDA is only after him, why is he still close to his children rather then sending just them away? 3. Why where those guys chasing the children of the ship when it was Jake they wanted and the only use for those brats was to lure Jake in? Jake was right there but instead they went after the children, so they could lure in Jake.
The marine biologist guy at the end will play an important role for the franchise moving forward
1:58 that was my major gripe with the movie
They came back with another brilliant hishe. It was fun to watch!
Oh my GOD THIS IS PERFECT
Still waiting on wakanda forever
Is that a giant Nickado whale? Well the enemy is dead now. 🤣
Hahaha so true! The chief disappears in the middle of battle! And the point made, they can clone the Navi why not just clone the whales hahaha
I like your song :D
Song at the end was pretty good no cap
Pregnant person on the battlefront is unnecessary and dum! Stop trying to make it work, Hollywood!!
It took me two seconds to place that quote from The Whale, and once I did I broke out laughing; genius reference.
But I work from home and don't wear socks.
2:50 * softly whisper * "Papyrus"
can we all appreciate his great animation it looks good and at atleast 16 fps
3:02 why don't they just clone the soldiers into an entire army in the first place?
1. 1:44 Yay! Tonowari to the rescue! 2. Now that Recom Quaritch kicked the bucket, what might he come back as in the next film?
The Whale reference killed me 😂
In this movie there's only three plot points, and all of them made it to the HISHE episode The Avatar movies are so overrated it's insane
This channel skip so many movies and visit the video y'all choose to put out? This trailer was not what it used to be
I was honestly thinking that. How is it that an entire tribe attacks and suddenly its only Suly and his family fighting when the eclipse happens?
i dunno what is a bigger joke ... the actual movie, this animated parody or the sponsor commercial...
AVATAR 3 :- WALK ON FIRE 😅😅😅
I lost it at the battle-cry fetus.
Welcome back to : i betrayed my race to clap some blue alien chiks part 2
2:43 - we can actually see jack and rose which was awesome
Do Wednesday like you did stranger things
That whale reference is ultimate
I hope Neytiri and Spider will have a healthy, serious conversation about that whole ship situation
Yep, the movie really is that bad
No 3 hour hishey Disappointed
Why is nobody talking about the whale with the machine gun? 🤣🤣🤣
it's because I think, somewhere deep inside for those people, barbarism is the point. I hoped I was wrong but more and more I think cruelty and barbarism is what give them their kick.
With the cloning whale brains, it's about profit margins. Hunting and exporting is already costly but the stuff is worth billions. But cloning is another millions level cost
Well.. James Cameron screwed up badly in this one…
James really hates when aquatic vessels float as intended
I’m dead how Payakhan bussing shots like that. This hishe really made me laugh 😂😂
The Whale cameo is everything.
Honestly the colonel should have died
Please do 'How Hawkeye Should Have Ended'!!
Do 'How Mortal Kombat 2021 Should Have Ended'!!
Ngl I wanted just one pair of socks the whole pack is waaay to expansive for me
Tons of great moments in this HISHE, but the one that easily takes the cake IMO is Paya-gun at 1:23. That had me cackling.
Avatar 2 was incredible and I think the point of the human doctors coming was so Jake would have to tell Kiri she can't keep connecting to eywa (God) this film is amazing incredible perfect and a enjoyable y from start to finish, i think the water tribe was fighting off the reinfircemebts that's my right headcanon, and I love Papyrus font it works so well for Avatar I'm so glad James Cameron doubled down on using that font, love the Titanic reference in the background that's the greatest masterpiece of a movie ever, God bless you.
I loved the movie--this is hilarious! Love the Jack and rose on the ship!
I mean 🤷🏾
Avatar2: shittiest movie ever.
Yes, I'm a subscriber. My pronouns are his/he
HISHE never fails to make me laugh. Not just exhale through my nose, but full on pause-the-video-to-wheeze-laugh *laugh*.
Someone help us bro!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was awesome! But missing one scene! Spider seeing the mom kill all those enemies and then saying "Nope!" And ok not going back to save his blue dad!
I was dead seeing Rose and Jack on the sinking ship😂😂
THE F*CKIN WHALE REFERENCE🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm crying
oh damn for once i totally didn't realized how the water tribe people just became absent at the end of the battle...
1:22 The hardest laugh all day
HAHAHA Im glad you said it too... I was like.... Where is the rest of the Metkeyena? War parties dont fuk off while the fights still going. haha
This movie was a shitshow. Only the first 10 mins were any good
“My Jake” 😂
How it really should have ended: an hour earlier
Am i seeing things, or did I just see a whale with a gun?
I don't get avatar...
This movie was three hours of flaws you could do an entire video series on it
I actually screamed out loud "GO UNDER THE FIRE" in the cinema. Never been more embarrassed XD.
Please bring back the dubbed videos, do a dubbed version of the Flash trailer or the Mario trailer.
Subtitles: (Normal baby screaming)  Me: That baby in the tummy is definitely not Normal
Garvin's right! listen to him
Jack and Rose on top of the sinking ship. lol
At 1:40. How is it that chief killed him with the back end of the spear?
2:40 jack and rose backside 😂
Were is the hero cafe socks?l
Man said MARTHAAA
I wish one day some director will let reviewers find plot points in the story and make a much logical movie
Kinda weird how the soldiers just never improved their tech like the arrow can still pierce through glass
Whale. You have done something good alright 🥰
Anyway, as a father, I understand why Jake called Norm for help.
Hold up! You have to give Brendan Fraiser whale subtitles! You can't have us understand from context! That's not accurate to the movie!
How'd this movie make over 2 billion dollars?
I can tell you guys really enjoyed The Way of Water. There's no way anyone who hates the film is this creative in mocking it. I commend you.
1:43 Why didn’t Tonowari did that earlier?  🍅Rotten Tomato Score: 97%🍅 CERTIFIED AS FRESH
Jack and rose on the sinking ship.
This was a dumpster fire of a movie. This should have been a flop.  It did not deserve a million dollars,  let alone a billion.
😂😂 socks
They could have nukes the entire planet
Toruk Makto! Hissssss
Thank you for the video.
LMFAOO I always wondered if anyone else noticed how much they used papyrus in the movie
"Odin Sleep" made me chuckle.
But I don't want socks. I just want the other things. Can't I just buy the other things?
The titanic sinking in the back
Unlimited _BBBBBBRRRRRROOOOOOSSSSSS_ ! - Sock Loving Palps Edit-- THIS CATCHY AF VILLAIN MERCH BRO OUTRO THO @ 03:25 to 03:52 🧦🕺🏾🥃  @ 02:10 to 02:22 - Darren stopped being a d🍆ck...oh wait, wrong movie.
Every point just got me
PAPYRUS!
Tbh, I kinda understand why Jake called his human friends when Kiri lost connection with the server due to ping spiked. I would too if it's an emergency and I have friends with medical knowledge available, especially when there aren't any nearby hospital.
I wonder this. Water people tribe has very small amount of people right. And jake left his big tribe to fight sky people with small tribe😂? To fight wht 10 t0 20 guys? He leaved his old tribe for their protection and endangered the water people 😂 y if he was with his old tribe the movie should have ended in 1 hr 😂
Shouldn’t have started
Bro that Whale cameo was awesome!  I was not expecting that lol
Yeah the whole whale hunting bs was so lame.
That was avatar movie series was great!!!!! making more avatar film series but, tv series!!!!!!
Just drop rocks on pandora from soace already
You can see Jake and Rose on the sinking ship 2:40
Next you should make, HISHE wakanda forever.
Or maybe just clone people and download your memories into your clone, thus negating the need for space whale brain goo entirely?
I hit ‘like’ more for the ad/song at the end than for the actual video.  Hahahahaha!
Seems a no-brainer to clone whale brain, geez writers need to get ahead of the game, audiences are way more keener than 2 decades ago.
Just clone the whale? 🤔 Didn't think of that. You guys know how to just cut right to it. 🤨
Producer:  So you have an idea for a movie? Pitch guy:  Yeah, I thought we could make a sequel to Avatar. Producer: No Pitch guy: but... Producer: No
I could not stop laughing at this
When are you going to do black panther wakanda forever
Imagine hishe plays after every Hollywood movies 😵‍💫😏😂🤣🫠
The Whale!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
They're gonna have to go full biotech in the next one, right? Like, if this is gonna be a full on war, they just can't win without full biotech.  Also, my biggest issue was, if they can terraform planets, why don't they just set up on mars, instead of halfway across the galaxy?
*AWATER 2*
Missed the cafe scene
Yeap, 3 hours of my life actually retconned by proper writing
As a design student my class has had numerous debates ab the papyrus font XD🤣🤣
Yup, I thought the same thing!
Puss in Boots have servant ended
"...or, better yet, just clone people and use the parts from the clone to replace the old parts of the original person until they're completely renewed."  "Didn't someone already make a movie about how bad that could go?"  "Yeah, but they said that you have to be conscious and mobile in order to have functioning organs, but the avatar bodies are proof that that isn't true here."
You know every james Cameron movie has plot holes but I just say to myself that it's a movie and made for entertainment and was I entertained? Oh yeah!
i LAUGHED AT THE FONT JOKE SO HARD LMAO
suddenly "marvel"istic ending
Yall never miss!
Did Brendan Fraser just turn into a whale
For How Wakanda Forever Should Have Ended, they should have the “But THIS is how it really should have ended” segment be Deadpool arrives in the beginning of the movie and actually revives T’Challa the same way he did with Wolverine in Logan! “Live! LIVE!”
More like how it should have started... "dad what is that falling out of the sky? There are dozens of them... "  " I am not sure son... but I suppose...." blinding flash of light and mushroom cloud billowing up into the atmosphere.  Back in orbit. " sir we have nuked large population sites and dropped defoliating agents on a third of the planet. We estimate that we will have full coverage withing 36 hours and the environment will collapse within 3 months. Large predatory animals will survive for additional 2 months. We can start landing the automated mining equipment from the next ship when it arrives in a week and we can set foot on the planet within 2 years. We will want to stay out of the radiated areas for about 20 years but other than that the planet is ours. I suggest we rename unatainaium. Easyanium."  "I hear the egg heads are working on a new hybrid clone that can tolerate the new environment but the idea is to build atmospheric processing plants and remove the toxins from the air so that humans can live on the planet without gas masks."
Alternately to hunting the giant, alien whales for their immortally granting brain juice... Humanity could just clone a younger version of someone's body and have them puppet it around like the Avatars until the rich folk who commissioned it gets so old that they just upload either their actual or a copy of their mind into a new clone body?
2:40 I see what you did there, you comedic bastards
2:11 LMAO THE TULKUN
Bro
Every movie directors out there should watch this channel
Please tell me the sock song is on Spotify
Hishe has saved me so much time with movies. I had no interest in watching the new avatar and now with this video…..I can safely say that I am happy with missing whatever that movie was
Why not just clone PEOPLE and then do the brain transfer thing?! You'd be effectively immortal that way and wouldn't have to spend so much on some whale brain juice.
Suprised yall didn't mention anything about Naturi about to kill that human kid and no one saying anything about it afterwards
Yall missed an opportunity to show how kiri went literal avatar with her spirit bending at the end of the movie
Or mister Baddy McBaddyson could have murdered the navi family one of any dozen times he threatened to kill them. It would have made for a more plausible villain. Especially considering the number of humans mercilessly killed by Navis during the movie.
They could just clone new human or avatar bodies and transfer their memories to them.
still if the next movie is about fire tribes we still riot right?
Oh my... Why is it so hard to see things that are so obvious like these, in the movies?
I loved the part where the whale decided to mag-dump the boat
If I buy the socks will you make a villian pub jacket or sweater that I can buy as well?
You literally adressed both the problems I had with the movie. Why the whole army disappeared why they were suddenly so afraid of water. Also saving the bad guy was meh.
Do Bullet Train The Movie HISHE
Very nice
LOL! LOVE IT!!! Keep up the AMAZING work guys!!
I never watched Titanic, but I guess Jack and Rose died from being caught on fire? That’s sad 😢
2:49  Seriously ? People are complaining about fonts now ?!?!?! Does anyone just enjoy anything anymore ?!?! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Wait they dont want the space rocks anymore. its something they could've easily replicated XD
Tonowari: "We've already see the sinking ship movie." ROTF!!
when is the song gonna release on Spotify
Don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy avatar 2 but the thing that most bothered me was “we better leave the tree people they won’t be safe with us here” and then leave to endanger a different tribe?
God, the relief I would've felt if the movie would've used some of these fixes, cutting it an hour or so shorter...
But where the heck is lo'ak at the end
That commercial rocked my sock off! xD
Here's a bright Idea. If they can both clone and transfer Conscious from 2 people. Then why not just clone rich people and transfer them to new bodies every lifetime?
From unobtainable Unobtanium to unobtainable whale brains...tell me how this movie is making money again?
They got sharks with guns in this movie? Need a whole movie just about that shark!
That baby bit I thought it was funny and the sock promotions.
You should do a Avatar hishe dub
This channel has given me so many lovely memories over the years Thank you
Did somebody else notice jack and rose on the sinking ship 😂
Avatar is something refuse to watch, but I'll watch this channel!
The Whale reference, I can't 🤣
I dont know why but the videos are not what they were before too much advertising , all that please like share subscribe and on top YouTube's ads make it not as it was before not that entertaining or funny anymore . Or im a bit Lackluster about YouTube overall ?
Didn't the guy at the end get his arm chopped off when Payakan the Tulkun caught the guy's arm with the wire?
Who else was more excited for this episode of HISHE more than the actual movie its parodying?
Can you do an animated comparison between Avatar 2 and Black panther 2 because James Cameron took 10 years to make practically the same movie. Invaders coming to the land looking for rare material that is only found on the land having to fight the local people. Water tribe shows up. Birth in the water. Giant water battle New kids showing up to help fight. There's more similarities than this I just can't think of any right now. Love your work and I'm sure I'm going to get a few pairs of socks.bye
Bro Brendan Fraser whale was hilarious, but also the other whale pulling up with the roscoe was so good
I’m honestly surprised that I haven’t heard more people talking about how the other chief just disappears during the big fight. Like he’s with Jake when they go to fight, then you just don’t see him again until the end of the movie. I honestly thought he might’ve died and I missed it.
Avatar: 2 Wet 2 Furious was literally about Jake, Neytiri and their family leaving their home to bum off living with distant relatives
Or pull an Altered Carbon and clone the human race and transfer your consciousness into the clone?
Oh come on its a James Cameron movie, of course there has to be a sinking ship moment lol
That Jack and Rose cameo on the sinking boat is hilarious
I don’t wear socks  You do now
I litteraly didn't notice they all disappeared during the fight, before people pointed it out. And I watched it twice
“Odinsleep” got me good.
2:12 The Whale😅😅
I have honest whenever I see someone sleeping and about to wake up I always think in my head Orin sleep 😂
Funny how they used a giant ship just to eliminate one small boat.  Scary thought: What if the sky people traded weapons with a Navi tribe in exchange for helping them eliminate the other groups?
*How The Super Mario Bros Movie Should've Ended:*  When asked by Bowser asks Luigi if he knows any other mustached human with a letter on their hat, we cut to a scene of Wario & Waluigi being taken away by Bowser's minions. Meaning Luigi had them kidnapped, to protect his brother.  They're jerks. They probably deserve it.  Luigi runs off to the Mushroom Kingdom, reuniting with his brother and giving Princess Peach a detailed description of Bowser's army, giving them the advantage.
HISH actually E: humans with super advanced technology would oneshot every hostile from mile away and would found anyone and anything they want within hours. This war is like conquistadors vs indians but indians have flying horses and conquistadors have ultra super duper technology. It would be a one week war.
This was funny!
The Whale with a Gun killed me.
Thank you for watching this movie so we don't have to. Your sacrifice will not go unappreciated 👨‍✈️
they have access to advanced cloning methods and can upload and download a human consciousness and memories. why don't they clone themselves and transplant their own personal data back into their own clones? eternal life solved. make a human avatar for once instead of a na'vi one
.........Why DIDN'T they just clone the whales?
I believe that font is called papyrus
I love how the Titanic is sinking in the background with Rose and Jack on it, and the Brendan Fraser whale had me in stitches.
so much unwanted violance I LOVE IT 😅
You know, the Villain Pub socks ad kinda makes you think. They used to put out a lot of content aside from the HISHE animations, like Super Cafe and Villain Pub standalone videos. But the last one of those came out a year ago to act in place of a Loki HISHE.   How come we don’t get any non-HISHE animations anymore?
😘
I thought for sure there would be a cameo by Namor and the people of Talakan in this video. So many swimming blue people in movies this year.
I gotta be honest now 😅 I love y'all plzz don't stop making these videos
Bro dumbest movie I've seen in a long damn time
I was hoping that there would be a piece about how the cloning tech makes the whole life extension reason of hunting the whales pointless. Especially since they have figured out how to transfer conciseness. So of course HISHE never disappoints.
Wow, a remarkable improvement to the first avatar video (not saying it wasn't great though). Love this channel
WHY DIDN'T THEY MENTION THE WEIRD THING OF SPIDER NEARLY BEING KILLED BY THE MOTHER?!?! SHE RAISED HIM!
Omg the last bit with the cloning!!! This was almost EXACTLY what I said in the theater! I was like “if we know what the mixture/compound is, we can probably synthesize it. It’s far more ethical, especially once we knew that the whale was sentient.”   I’m a biochemist (this is on my uni degree), and we can make just about any compound that exists naturally in a creature or plant given enough time and resources using, at the highest biological level, bacteria, a plant, or mice. Sometimes it’s just beakers and a week of mixing chemicals. If we could clone a sentient being without any brain signals, we can make this immortality soup commercially in six months to a year at a fraction of the cost of hunting a sentient whale.
NO NOT Brendan Fraser😂
FIRST line ... "bro! i mean DAD" LOL 😭😄
YEARS of fighting the occupying humans and Jake’s buddies didn’t figure they’d track a stolen helicopter?
I actually thought about that whale juice thing while watching the movie. There's actually quite a few things/problems that could be solved with the whole cloneing thing.
How about if they just put Spider back in prison after he kept disrupting the sky peoples plans
Who else caught that Titanic moment in the background? Genius! 😂
1:23 LOL!!!
You are back.🎉
I was surprised I didn’t initially see more people talking about how weird it was that they fully left the old clan to escape the bad guys, but called their friends over the minute one of the kids was kind of sick
How dare you disrespect Papyrus.
How morbius should have ended video please!
The Whale aahahahahaaa! omfglols
The song is amazing
1:52 Tonowari calling out the producers of Avatar 🤣
Dude, you can't have the humans being intelligent in these movies otherwise the Navi would have been all killed with no effort.
Haven’t seen the movie but I don’t plan on watching it
the whale 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why does the end song sound like NSP whisper singing 😂
If they could upload personalities and memories into an avatar, why didn't they back up Jake's brother when he was alive, and just upload him into the avatar after he died?  Obviously the technology existed prior to Avatar 1.
The animation 1 minute in makes me think of Battleblock Theater's puppet style XD
Story was so fuckin boring and I say that as an Avatar fan…
That Whale was out of nowhere and Hilarious
I think the whole movie was weird, in Avatar 1 they got humans of pandora, here they destroyed just one big ship, whole human base is still here. Aaaand if they made avatars with transfered memory of dead peapoleeee. They can do it over and over again
"Jake Sooley, you speak the true-true..."
I love how much of a brand the Villain Pub has become.
Thanos: Those socks are inevitable!
So glad I skipped this one
I am so happy I did not watch this movie.
There should also be a HISHE for Point Break, Speed, The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions (a new version), John Wick, John Wick: Chapter 2, and John Wick: Chapter 3: Parabellum in anticipation of John Wick: Chapter 4.
I want socks song!
2:22 All hail the mighty Brendan Fraser
this movie actually made me furious. for a number of reasons, and I won't say them here. Just wanted to put that out there.
How way of water should have ended:  1 hour 30 minutes earlier
ant-man quantum mania, has an how it should have ended in every scene.
The whale reference was out of pocket
2:42  Look closely at the sinking ship and you can see Jack and Rose on the stern
Alejandro Vargas
That guy speaks like that guy from Black Ops Cold War
Nice sock ad.
I want one 0:01
Wait, what happened to "here's a bright idea"?
This is the satire we want.. & also the one we need...
Lmaoo I didn't even watch the movie and I could tell this version made more sense. Super funny guys 👍👍
Thanks for this.  Always great when you can point out a major flaw in the whole plot.
I hate James Cameron's AVATAR movies I hate them "I hate them" ((I HATE THEM)) ! $ % & ? @ # € ((✊"😬"✊)) € # @ ? &%$!
Much better than wasting 3 hours actually watching Moist Avatar!
I seems *all* the animals are strapped
Can we get more villain pub episodes?
Meanwhile everyone keeps escaping the boat and then getting back on and putting themselves back in danger for no reason.
i thought the same thing as you in the end. just clone the stuff.
Additionally, in 2024, will there be a HISHE for National Lampoon’s Van Wilder, Just Friends, Definitely, Maybe, The Proposal, Adventureland, Buried, The Change-Up, Green Lantern (2011), Turbo, The Croods, RIPD, The Hitman’s Bodyguard, Pokemon Detective Pikachu, The Croods: A New Age, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, Free Guy, Red Notice, The Adam Project, and Spirited, which all starred Ryan Reynolds, in anticipation of Deadpool 3, which will be released on November 8th, 2024? Since Shawn Levy, the director of the Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, Free Guy, and The Adam Project, is going to direct Deadpool 3, there should be a HISHE for the Night at the Museum films and Real Steel. Hugh Jackman is also going to return as Wolverine one last time in Deadpool 3.
This is yet another awesome HISHE video!  Crazy!!  👍🏼
What will the next HISHE video be of? Will it be The Mandalorian Season 2, The Mandalorian Season 3, The Book of Boba Fett Season 1, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish, Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Flash (2023), Dune (2021), and maybe in anticipation of the upcoming Blade movie, Blade (1998), Blade II, and Blade Trinity? Or will it be Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, the video game from 2021 by Square Enix and Eidos-Montreale?
That Brendan Fraser cameo was WILD
Good to have you back
Water Smurfs!
I just realized how long HISHE has been making these videos. I've been watching him since 2011.
Why Are They Still Going To Make More Of This Shart....Oh, Right....
But Jake's son is still dead?
It should have ended with the first film 🤔Just my opinion, clearly many people liked it. Probably more so when your choices are Marvel film A, Marvel film B, Marvel film C, some random romance movie nobody noticed and some obscure Oscar films nobody went to the theater to watch. 😁
less go🔥🔥
The Brendan Fraser cameo killed me 💀
Thank you!! I was so upset at some of the movie plot holes
how about all that man power and supplies is not worth $80mil. the top 1% today are thinking "that's it and ill stop ageing?"
THANK YOU!!!  I was so annoyed that they didn't swim under the fire!
Yeah, why couldn't they clone the pandora whale brains? It's like, why did they need unobtainium for an energy crisis when they have starships with anti-matter engines to get them to the alien planet. The invention of anti-matter engines basically negates an energy crisi. But hey, gaping plot holes ain't gonna stop these movies filling up said holes with money.
Ok.. liked this.... But... I would have LOVED it if we brought back "nuking them from orbit" from the first HISHE for avatar agian 🤣
That end song slaps
That whale reference was so far out of left field 😂😂
Where was the bar
You know what fun a cat wearing a boot defeated a blue aliens civilitation at theaters
Anyone notice the titanic characters?
Been missing you guys!
8.9k like.
1:24 i fuckin' lost it m8
What I liked is how those helicopter things were taken out by one single arrow crushing through the glass and killing the pilot. Jake's wife alone did that at least four times in this movie. You'd think the humans would have caught on to this structural weakness in their vehicles and done ANYTHING to correct it.
GG
Well, I LOVED the movie
I will return when I’ve seen the movie 😊
You forgot a scene with strangulation while being UNDERWATER
It should’ve ended with the first movie.
I am surprised none of these endings had Neteyam survive.
LETS GET THE MERCH PURCHASES TO 500. I WANT MY VILLAIN PUB SOCKS!!!  or else everyone will be refunded, won’t get the merch, and will be sad :(
1:15 still wonder why those windows aren't thicker
waiting for an SNL Papyrus sequel
I was late to the party till yesterday. Movie was amazing!!! So is this.
Nah the fetus raging has me crying
2:43 please tell me if I am the only one who noticed Jack and Rose on the sinking ship.
I guess 13 years was worth the wait
Man villains always  win in the avatar movies
I was so hoping that according to your version their eldest son would survive 😭
Nice
Buy season 1?! Come on bro
NO WAY YOU GUYS PULLED A WHALE FOR BRENDAN HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAA
Thanks for preserving the distracting Signourney Weaver voice. Seriously, it took me out of the movie every time she was on screen. 😆
that beggining where natayma said Bro insted of Father is so accurate. i hated that they spoke  like they are from some getto in New Yorkyi mean seriously
I fucķung HISHE ANT MAN QUANTUMANIA, SHE HULK E MS MARVEL.
havnt even watched the movie and after watching this.. i dont think i need to lol
The villain merchandise socks. 😂
it is great . when will black Panther 2 be uploaded .
Wow, I would have never expected Brendan Fraser from The Whale to randomly show up as a whale, didn’t see that coming
any hero cafe socks?
Already ??!!
cool song at the end 3:05
The Whale reference lol
Thank You! The whole time I was thinking why not just clone the whales? You can clone the Naavi so why not them?
2:10 Nice reference to the new Brendan Fraser movie The Whale🤣🤣, oh my God, that’s a great movie and a great performance!
Odin sleep 🤣🤣
“We have all this technology why don’t we just clone the whales?”  Me: * slaps desk * *THANK YOU* ! I can’t even begin to stress how much the whaling scene bothers me for how stupidly pointless it is narratively.
They had to save something for Avatar 3: Swimming Under Fire
I know it’s been a long time but plz do How the Incredible Hulk should have ended
Aight bet I’ll get those socks asap
The villain pub socks are good, but I wouldn't want anything else and they only do mixed packs. Come over to the dark side, we drink whisky and draught beer, not cans and bottles.
xD
The Whale brain cloning plot hole is so massive that I didn't even realize it after watching the movie.
villan pub socks!!!
Where’s the “wailers on the Moon” skit?
So much murder in these Avatar movies
Man Ronal’s baby screaming in battle was funny 😂
in one of the Avatar books it say that one of the exports of Pandora is biological materials that can be replicated back on Earth, so there was really no need to continuously kill the whales
The Weeknd-like synth end credits cracked me up 😭😭😭
Cool
The baby in the womb screaming caught so off guard. I laughed way too hard at that.
I sense a great disturbance in the box office, as if millions of voices cried out "thank you for giving me a better version of this movie and saving me the ticket price and 4 hours of my life" and then suddenly they all bought socks for some reason.
8th Wonder of the World Why TF did the chief and his army leave yet his Only Daughter was still missing. Like seriously, how do you forget your ONLY daughter
Anybody remember how The 2nd to Last Samurai and Still Dancing With Wolves ended? It should have ended like them for continuity sake
I was really hoping for: tail-end of first move with "THE END" with someone at the Cafe or Pub laughing saying something like "would you imagine if they let James Cameron make more of these FernGully sequels?"
Damn there were so many things to hishe and Daniel only covered like 3. CMOWN GUYS
I was honestly so confused when halfway through the battle all the water tribe warriors just kinda... disappeared. We have a huge battle scene then it's just Jake's family vs the bad guys.
i miss villain pub so much🥲
I have yet to meet anyone who watched this move
Oh a hishe of that new Avatar film the way of water
Baby aaaaahhhhhh. 😆😆😆
If the whale brain juice is $80mil a pop, how cheap is galatic space travel while moving insane amounts of materials across outer space? Also, humanity already figured out immortality, they can literally take a copy of your brain with perfect memories and clone you in whatever body you want.
TRUUUUE
Why do these movies make so much money, yet no one seems to really talk about them? No one seems that into them either. Not bashing them, at least they're not 30 year later sequels or reboots. I just don't get it. If you like them a lot, I'd love to hear why. Maybe I'd get then.
The titanic sinking in the background is a nice touch
These videos are amazing
1:50 is so true where did all those guys go in the movie?
noticed how much the film lacked substance with your video! great as always :DD
When my friend explained the plot of this movie was basically just the first one with whale brains instead of unobtainium, I immediately said "don't you mean unob-brain-ium?"  It's so easy, and yet I've never seen anyone use it. Come on people!
"We have to call-" "Odin sleeep" "I have done it!" "Oh-"
You know how surreal this is? I've just done watching The Whale
I just love how Titanic just sinking on the background with Jack and Rose on board
P A P Y R U S
Garvin's whole spiel at the end is **exactly** what I said as I was walking out of the theater.
i mussed you guys. so are you guys going to do m3gan?
This is definitely right
One thing to win it: Robot suits which actually cover pilot
I always end up watching this before the actual movie and end up confused as to why the movie ended differently and worse.
This tells me I made the right choice electing to NOT go see this in cinemas! Geez louise.
This needs to be sent to James camera man
Nice vid
I have been waiting to watch this since yesterday
I mean I feel like this is how long the movie would be if they cut out all the filler shots of swimming and staring at one another.
Addressing the disappearance of the Metkayina tribe in the final battle, James Cameron originally included a reunion with them in the conclusion but test audiences said it didn't actually work well so they were cut from the final edit. Ironically now people are saying it was a plot hole when in fact it was a deliberate choice to omit them due to poor test screenings.
It's Papyrus! It's just Papyrus!
I'm excited for the Oscar recap and Batman or Shuri getting angry that the blue turds were nominated for telling the exact same story again.
That whale scene got me!
I don’t even know what else Colonel Quaritch’s gonna do in the next movie since he’s still alive as a Na’vi
0:45  "Odinsleep"😅
Can you please do Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, please?
And why not clone humans, hey you already can save your memory and emotions on a freaking flash drive...
In Avatar 2 Humans are trying to colonise Pandora because earth is dying but if they have the means to reach a planet 4.37 light years away from earth in 6 years why not pick a different planet instead of the one with the Poisnous Atmosphere, Hostile wildlife and Natives who tend to kill them on sight.
2:40 titanic?
this 4 minutes of video was 2 minutes of sock ad
Many years later, and still no nuke from the space
I miss you guys HISHE. Thanks fore returning.
A whale shooting a pistol at a whaling ship is not something I expected to see today.
When did they change Beer Koozies to Freakers?
It all should end by humans landing on main tree and frying Jake and his family and tribe into ash. And no one is going to water tribes, and no one is attacking human trains, and anaptanium is near to get it.
Totally worth waiting 13 years for.
PAPYRUS!!!!
Every reason why I've never watched even 5 minutes of any Avatar movie are captured in 4 minutes. Nicely done.
I know right?
Now I don't have to watch the actual movie. Cheers, HISHE crew 🙂
Love the attention to details, the weekend feature at the end lol
I hope you guys do Jurassic Park 2 and 3 soon…
One of those "if we thought this out logically" moments I see 🙄
I love it when you guys point out flaws in movies in your videos
This had some really good jokes! Very well made
Jack and Rose sinking with the ship I nearly lost is 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro that first scene had me rolling so hard.
2:41 did anyone else notice the couple from Titanic in the back
i watched it in 3d it was frikin amazing
🐋🐋🐋
1:12 You must be very knowledgeable in parentinh to know how to differentiate normal from vengeful baby screaming!
this movie’s desicions made horror movie characters look smart
Not so much how it should have ended - I would have been fairly happy had it not happened   It was a long 3 hours
I’m surprised you haven’t done Black Panther: Wakanda Forever yet.
If Bowser won't get a villan pub special for his film debut, like Thanos and Palps did for their return, we riot
Yo, the adrenochrome harvesting was the oddest part of this movie
Even wrost id you think about It insted of using whale juice to live forever why not Just make new human bodies and transfer your concious?
I honestly thought the movie was ok, but I just couldn't understand why the humans would want to settle on an inhospitable world with a known hostile native population.
Ooh, finally.
2:38 I love how you just snuck in Jack and Rose from Titanic
The Titanic cameo was perfection 🤌🏽
I loved the movie!! I think I watch movies with my brain off But dyamm that was one good movie
The whale referance :)
That was awesome!! Thank you!
The Whale. Hehe
Aaaaaaaannnnd of course this is better than the movie.
1:53 The literally definition of make it make sense 🤣.
Nice
Really wasn’t a huge fan of this one because so much of it was just the first movie again. Real way the movie should have ended is the arrows bounce off the glass because they learned how to use arrow proof glass and then our protagonists are obliterated by a large number of missiles. Seriously it’s incredibly surprising that Earth apparently learned absolutely nothing from their first encounter.  Actually better solution you use more of those scorched earth missiles and incinerate the entire forest not just the area around your base or maybe just orbital bombardement it works.
Also parody The Weeknd credits song lolz
Water Tribe!!! Oh wait wrong avatar. Lol
For a small vial worth more than $80 million, doesn't the whale brain juice seem kinda cheap? Like you have to fly across the universe to get it and with inflation 80 million seemed like a deal.
Another piece of antihuman and proprimitivism propaganda Pocahongas ripoff by James Cameron
Copy on cheers. What about sideshow Bob meets the villains pub
The horrible font LMAO!!!🤣
I loved this
2:46 glad that they get to show the alternate ending instead of going on the ship
The fetus scream hahahaha
1:23 XD
Thank you now I don't feel like I missed anything by not watching this flic
That part with Brendan Fraser killed me 😂
The sock song was epic 🤣🤣🤩
"This is not the go back in the sunken ship movie, its the swim under the fire movie" XD. Also yeah it was weird that The water tribe just left after it got dark
I didnt even see it, waiting for it to hit the web so I can pause for bathroom breaks. Lol
Love these lol
Just wanted to say, Wong actually did „Yes Wong“ in Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. At the fight of the Karmar-Taj were Wanda was shoot he did it.
Avatar is such anti human propaganda XP
I had totally forgotten about the Oscar-worthy performance from The Whale. So majestic
1:23 When did Slowpoke Rodriguez take over.
Hopefully Wakanda Forever is next
Wow.........I would actually understand this a LOT more if I watched the movie, huh?.......which I have absolutely NO desire to do mind you...........😅
was what modak reference on whale face?
WTF happend there
"Chief Sitting Bull, the proposition that you were a peaceable people before the appearance of the white man is the most fanciful legend of all!"
2:10 I’m dead  omg
1:50 FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT. This confused me so much as to why he disappeared
I think it is kinda weird that the humans didn't pack up their hovercraft and leave once they had Jake's kids as they clearly saw that he was not coming alone.
Can't wait for Avatar 3: The Rise of the Fire Nation!
The sudden Whale reference caught me off guard
2:40 Jack and Rose ❤️
Can you do how Hawkeye should have ended.
Hshie always names movies makes more since
I thought this would be longer but I ain't gonna complain 😂😂
Yes Tom Riddle, we all want those socks as well too.
This was better than the actual movie
When I saw this in theaters a thought occurred to me. There should be no feasible way for the Na’vi to fight back. I mean, the Humans just landing their ships destroyed miles of landscape. Imagine what their weapons should be capable of. Like, when Quaritch arrived with his squad of Avatar soldiers, the Humans' leaders on the Pandora told him that they know where Jake is, but that they can’t reach him because of the Banshees swarming their ships. Why didn’t Quaritch remark, “So, we know where our main enemies and their leader is?” Ardmore replies, “Yes, but there’s too many of the scary Pandora dragons.” Quaritch looks at her in disbelief and says, “Just orbitally bombard them until those mountains are dust. We’re a spacefaring species. Something like that should be easy for us.” Ardmore, “Ooooh. Right, I forgot about that.” Movie ends with Jake, his family, and all their people slaughtered without a way to do anything about it.
Ryan Goslings: Why Papyrus? I know what you did again.
😂😂😂 the ship sinking movie hilarious titanic reference 2:30
Cool merchandise.
You should make a Puss in Boots 2 HISHE.
Silly question, but size are the socks? I wear size 14 shoes and I need to know if the socks are going to cut off my circulation or not. 🤣😂
Oden sleep had me on the floor
BRO, do one for the new Antman movie. So many flaws.
2:10 I was so confused at first...then i got it and died laughing
Hilarious and on-point as always. Also nice detail showing how your Hishe became a lot better looking with your Avatar video
This is gold 🤣
1:23 XD What!?
next are: Avatar 2 The Way Of Earth and Avatar 3 The Way of Fire
Meh. Idk if these are worse now or I'm just depressed, but meh.
2:50 *_PAPYRUSSSSSSSSS_*
The Whale reference sooo wrong!,
It was an amazing movie tho, would deffo recommend watching it
Just destroyed this movie
The first Avatar was way better in my opinion.
I'm so confused 🤣Good job, Hishe, even without watching the movie, this was hilarious to watch.
I couldn't agree more with everything shown in this video.  I might have even enjoyed the movie.
Dang Carvin should have thought of that earlier. Definitely would have saved a ton of money and time
I thought they were gonna make Spider do the Tarzan yell because he literally looks like Tarzan with a gas mask on most of the time.
I still haven't seen the movie and after seeing this I really don't want to see the movie now even more than I already didn't want to
2:39 Jack and Rose are on the ship in the background 😆 🤣 😂
ODINSLEEP 🤣
The fraser cameo made me laugh, cry, and cough at the same time. Jesus that was funny
I was not expecting Brendon Fraser to show up
Only graphic designer understand papyrus font joke
and yet we have to wait until July to watch it over and over again on Disney plus
Brilliant. It was a good point about whale brain cloning.
2:11 MODOK whale for the win 🤣
What about black panther?
FINALLY
Love the whale part :)
Finally... ENBY socks
Why not how Wakanda forever should have ended?

2:49. I actually like the font for the subtitles.
It always bothered me how Tonowari was for some reason absent on the final fight against Quaritch. Even my parents who are fans of Avatar are bothered by that fact.
HOW ANT-MAN AND THE WASP QUATAMANIA SHOULD HAVE ENDED
Oh sick! This just saved me like 3 hours of my life. Thanks HISHE!
HOW BLACK PANTHER WAKANDA FOREVER SHOULD HAVE ENDED
This movie had some serious plot holes and it was noticed
Nice to see Rose and Jack were the only ones on THAT boat!
The whale with a gun 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:35 'We've already seen the ship sinking movie'. I was half expecting a Kate Winslet Titanic joke there... Edit: Never mind,. Didn't spot them at 2:41 until later. Well played HISHE, well played!
Does anyone else think it's weird that arrows can somehow pierce through futuristic bulletproof glass, as if it were wet cardboard?
To late I wasn’t going to see it anyway
They didn't even mention the fact that all of that work to get that whale brain serum only goes for 80 million. Like yes that's a lot of money. But look at all the work and technology that goes into just getting one tube. Plus, you have to travel to pandora then back to earth to get that money. Clearly they are doing that at a huge loss of profits
I did not think about them just cloning those whale brains. That would have been far more reasonable than just hunting them.
As for the technology in this movie, I agree. Like humans have advanced technology, but still have to hunt ancient resources? And another thing like war weapons used the same way as the last time that had been defeated. They didn't even think of bringing a more powerful weapon? Although according to the story, human technology is quite advanced.
Even though it might seem to be a little fishy, getting hammered by a hammerhead shark / whale with a revolver and stacked abs was certainly the best way to go.
Yeah!!! Avatar 2 HISHE!!
YEESSS THEY SHOULD HAVE SWAM UNDER THE WATER FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!!!
Anyone saw Jack and Rose at 2:43
DUDE, I'm from India! So I can't buy the socks & FREAKERS. Well, loved your video! Plz like my comment!
2:34 Titanic Reference
And now they want to make more avatar movies... My heart will break into pieces if I see another "rise of Skywalker" or something similar...
The Whale reference was awesome😂🤌
everyone just gonna ignore the whale packing at 1:22 ?
First
you know how it really should have ended?  *A lot sooner*
Here before I watch the movie 😄
Hi
I am really surprised you guys didn't make a joke about the fact that if the humans had just used the depth charges they were shown to have in the whale hunt in the scene where they are all charging the boat on there flying fish crocodiles it would have instantly won the fight by killing everything underwater and allowing the guns to kill the rest above water. It would have even forced the whale away.
So true don't get me wrong I love the movie but those are things that I even noticed
Jack and rose are in avatar
Payakan was the best character.
This is just *chef’s kiss*
Do how Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark should have ended
Probably because the cost of successfully cloning, and then raising and feeding the clone to maturity, outweighs the benefits.
ngl Garvin really should have shut up
that sure was water...
😂😂😂😂
Was not expecting a reference to The Whale, lol.
The Titanic sinking in the background killed me 😂😂
HISHE made a reference to an A24 movie, and it's not EEAAO.
Make one about RRR ❤️🙌
Wait a second. Whaler dude aint wearing a mask.
Brendan Fraser's The Whale XD *chef's kiss*
Man. Odin sleep is quite the call back
we whant new villan pob content with the new pixa villans jack Horner and the wolf aka death from puss in boots 2 they both are arsome :D
DON'T ask questions about technology in Avatar. Otherwise you'd realize that with their tech level 1)Earth can't be endangered and especially dying; 2)all magical resources of Pandora cost far less then resources needed to produce them. Earth has brain uploading and mass production of antimatter. Aging and energy crisis can be solved with those. Which leaves you with only one explanation ie -scripwriter ducked up- Earth's government is lying to provide false incentives for establishing colony/outpost on Pandora.
Kiri’s face at 0:27 😂😂😂
The most fantastic part of Avatar is that they really make you believe that the Navi had an idelic civilization without diseases or internal conflicts, really they make such a big effort to show that they don´t need human technology
What is this Tonowari!! WHAT IS THIS!!!
Payakan shooting a gun is HILARIOUS!!! 🤣🤣🤣
"Odin-sleeeeeep" is one of my favorite underrated Hishe Jokes.
"Bro! I mean dad!"
Dude seriously what about lo'ak or neteyam for example you could have the sully's follow lo'ak and maybe I don't know add Payakan being welcomed by the clan.
Really pushing the merch, eh?  Another great episode.  Visually stunning movie saddled with an unfortunately bad script.
1:11 LMFAO 😭😭
How The Whale should Have Ended please
The way their legs moved while swimming was kinda funky.
2:58. Here's my question: If human scientists have the ability to create Avatar versions of the Navi, & the Navi in turn can put a human soul into their Avatar, why not just do this for as many humans as possible to survive on Pandora rather then try to terraform it for humans to live on it? Sure, it would mean giving up humanity to become an alien species, but when Earth is dying & humans can't survive on Pandora, when there is a way for us to adapt to do so just bring as many humans to Pandora as possible & turn them all into Navi.
I'm surprised they didn't make a joke about the kids getting caught like 50 times in this movie
That Whale part got me 😂
"Ah....I love the smell of CGI in the morning...!"
Please, Please, Please! Make a 'How It Should Have Ended' video on RRR: Rise Roar Revolt 💥
Seeing Jack and Rose on the stern of the ship in the background caught me so off guard, I nearly spit my drink out
Waiting for RRR
WATER CHIEF GO
Is all out war of the Avatars. That shooting whales so epic funny 😆😆😆
2:48.. PAPYRUSSSS!!!
Quaritch: What the-I thought you left!?
They had some crate of high tech stuff on their Banshees.
2:30. I like how as the ship is gradually sinking in the background you can see for a few seconds at the end Jack & Rose holding on to the end of it like they did in Titanic.
😂😂😂
You forgot about option, kids run to water village and parent fight continue.
The Whale with a gun had me in stiches.
Did anyone else see that giant whale thing firing with a machine gunner
That Brendan Fraser cameo was completely unexpected and hilarious
Buy Amc Stock now
Hope you make Wakanda forever
What about the Planet breeding some kind of Zerg for Defence ? ;-)
It was so weird how all the water people disappeared suddenly leaving Jake and natiri alone
Wow that’s cool!!! Plz make more, hishe!!!
This is great- Just as good as Avatar 2 with a 20$ budget- xD I really did wonder where Tonowari just disappeared to in the middle of the battle- xD
I wish it ended with the imperium comming to pandora it be funny to see black templars screaming while doing it
Lol always did wonder why everyone left after the middle of the battle
Bruh, that whale pulling out the gun XD   Yes I forgot what it's actually called.
Do you guys know the movie Killer Bean: Forever? Yes, that is a real movie by Jeff Lew, and the whole thing is on YouTube. Can we get a HISHE for this movie? It would be amazing. The whole movie's already a million parodies in one, so parody the parodies!
2:10 Did not see that "Whale" joke coming 😅😅😅
....Not being made.
That’s how you condense a 3 hour movie 😂
God I don't think I've laughed this hard at a HISHE in a while
You missed the fact that because of Jake, Earth has been rendered completely uninhabitable and mankind is now on the brink of extinction
Omg... the WHALE killed me.
Now I don't have to see the film
Dammit, I didn't expect the Whale reference! 10/10 for this parody, only because of this.
A:"have you guys done any of the now three jumanji movies? B:"I noticed a significant leap in production for your black adam video what happened, toon sandwitch took it over or what?
That font is amazing.
the thing is they've already created immortality... they said they transferred the memories of the soldier into the body of the navi, why not just do that with a human body clone them boom, you're essentially immortal. sure it's technically a copy but it's basically a philisophical debate at that point.
Oh god the whale reference had me wheezing😂😂😂😂
Do puss in boots the last wish
1:27 me trying to make a jump with a car in gta.
Send an army of the Astra Militarum to purge these xenos
The Whale reference 😂😂
please make how Puss In Boots should have ended (bots parts)
Did not expect a Whale reference
2:40 looks like they made the exact same models for Jack and rose as they were in 2012.
YES, BRENDAN FRASER REFERENCE! WAY TO INCLUDE THE WHALE,.MY DUDES! 🐋 🐋 🐋
Still haven't seen it 😗
1:02 The Tulkun with a hand gun was a classy touch...
If you want to make me buy your villain pub socks then i don’t know, maybe, ACTUALLY PUT A VILLAIN PUB SCENE IN THE VIDEO  (I’m just joking around ok) Edit: (I don’t even wear socks)
Just like the movie, I see production leap here, with slight expection of that snagged soldier and jake's feet. Also good to see someone delivering laughs again, been a while! Who else with me?
At last what we’ve all been waiting for the return of the Pub
1:03 When a helicopter is chasing me in gta.
lol the usage of the one and only scene I know from the Whale trailer 😂
👍👍👍👍
Wait, the plot was anti-aging alien whale brains?
One thing that always bothered me: If humans were advanced enough to create Navi bodies, then why didnt they use it to alter human biology? Why couldnt they create lungs that could breathe both air and xenon. Also they could've used that technology to make Jake's legs work again.
LoL
Never in my life would I expect to be completely moved by a song about socks but here we are
That baby war cry is the best.
The best part was the socks!!!
2:36 You can see the Titanic sinking with Rose and Jack on top. It's funny too the Titanic is also directed by James Cameron.
You guys are so rare this days. It's like you upload video and nothing special and long
First to this absolute masterpiece
HISHE Rocks ❤❤❤ Next video on Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero 🐉 & RRR 🌊🌋
Next... How Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Should Have Ended.
Puss in boots 2 was better.
105th comment
I was thoroughly surprise with the reference of Brendan Fraser's 'The Whale" Good job guys
This movie should have never existed. It should have ended after the first one
Needed more Batman.
Swimming under the fire would've been a no-brainer in the movie called The Way of Water.
No batman??
2:14 Brendan Fraser as a Pandoran Whale Dude!
havent seen it yet. the cloning might be in the works, but even half life like the clone troopers will take a while for something big like a whale. even if they are dangerous, just build the facility on a salt flat so it cannot escape into the ocean.
I was expecting a Batman cameo🥺
PJ NEVER DISAPPOINTS ❤️
Love your video from Pakistan🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰💕💕
When the whale popped up 🤣🤣🤣
Lmao the font
Titanic reference in the background.
Titanic at 02:42 😄
Like seriously why did they not swim under the fire
Next video: How Puss in Boots: The Last Wish should've ended
2:40 Jack and Rose 😂😂
As soon as I saw the sinking ship I was wondering if there was going to be a Titanic reference...nice.
Brenden Frasser got me off guard
1:54 Best Take That jab ever at that infamous scene of Na'vi allies of Jake conveniently missing in that battle.
The sinking ship movie reference got me 😂😂
Hey where's Batman??
👍
Do How Wakanda Forever Should Have Ended and also Hawkeye, Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, and She-Hulk as well.
Wish you would upload more often
This is both an avatar and how the whale should’ve ended
It’s not just a horrible font, IT’S PAPYRUS!!!!
I like the titanic reference
Payakan with a gun that's new 01:22
The murder tulkun with a gun, just epic
Love the little titanic reference in the background 😂
Also the papyrus font........
Noticable detail: Metcayina clan people look muscular than Omaticaya!
Voldemort: “I don’t wear socks” Me: same
Another good vid,hishe keep the good work❤️
We all have seen a sinking ship movie already. Lmao
1:25 Meet Discount Jason Momoa
The screaming baby killed me 😂😂😂😂
ODINSLEEP!!
Seriously, why was she just sitting there while her family was dying
The Whale
The shortest video for the longest movie... Yeah, makes sense.
So same as Avatar 1, Got it. Still hilarious!
Never thought Palpatine would be selling socks, something new for everyone I supposes
quartich is cute in avatar body ^⁠_⁠^😻🐈🐾
38th comment, at least it says 37 comments right now, so..
first?
Well done! 👍
already so many comments
nice vedio
THE FREAKING WHALE! 😂😂
HISHE is amazing,just amazing!
Love this channel
Lmfao🫠
I don't even seen it yet but i just say congrat to condense a 3 hour movie into 4 minutes vid
This is the way of whatever
It has been a long time since HISHE has done a non-superhero, Star Wars, or Jurassic Park Movie.
YAYYYYY
*FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS I LAY DORMANT, WHO HAS DISTURBED MY-* Oh it's HISHE who has returned with a new video. Glorious!
You and CinemaSins should do a collab
James Cameron better keep this franchise away from Disney's clutches  Because they're gonna milk it dry
നൈസ്
0:22 Guess she received a shocking reception.
Its always a great day when HISHE uploads a video.
Where is the rest of the phase 4 of MCU????
Semper Fi
Here!
I  remember watching HISHE's Avatar one that was released 11years ago then re-uploaded, it's so amazing to see how far they have come, thank you guys for being awesome❤️
Super Cafe was their greatest creation
Nineteenth
Yeah 5th one
Finally 🧠
😂😂!
Wow
Please do Wakanda Forever!!!!!
When the world needed them most, they returned
People shouldn't blame TIM MILLER for the failure of "Terminator: Dark Fate"  He was the director, not the writer  Killing John Connor was James Cameron's idea   Miller deserves another chance because he still got a lot to offer  He gave us DEADPOOL and SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, directed by his friend, Jeff Fowler   Plus, he also made LOVE, DEATH and ROBOTS
Do HISHE Dubs Into the Spider-Verse
